2531,"2016-08-27",3.4,"Low alcoholic APA, a session APA so to speak, brewed by Mikkeller at the Proefbrouwerij, like the majority of their beers. Frothy and slowly thinning, regular, off-white, dense head over a pale orange blonde beer with vivid sparkling and a diffuse haze of yeast throughout, making it only the slightest bit hazy at first, but a fully misty, darker peach orange when the rest of the bottle is added. Dank but subtle aroma of orange peel, yellow grapefruit flesh, mandarin, strawberry, dried mango, candied lemon, withering flowers and decaying hay (old hops?), toast, biscuit, lime blossom, sweet paprika, sparkling mineral water. Crisp onset, clean and restrained sweetish fruitiness with some sourishness, impressions of pink grapefruit, tangerine, kiwi and starfruit, somewhat fizzy carbo adding to the body, which otherwise is evidently thin and watery as can be expected from a beer below 3% ABV; light biscuity and mildly toasted malt middle, thin as said and surrounded by a notably minerally flavor (as in sparkling water), leading to a drying, aromatic finish with retronasal pink pepper- and grapefruit peel-like aromas, providing a mild but well-positioned, resinous, oily bitterness. The bitterness is delicate but lasts for a while, along with the mineral water-like flavor (by which I mean the minerals that can be tasted in a very subtle manner in most sparkling waters) and a thin thread of the toasted malt accent. Subtlety is key here: obviously this is a very thin and light beer (also in mouthfeel), but still Mikkeller has managed to impregnate it with carefully dosed malt and hop flavors, well in balance with each other. Light or diet version of an ordinary APA, one could argue, relating to the latter like a light lager relates to a standard pale lager. I reckon this Henry Jagger (actually showing a caricature of Mick Jagger on the label) may well be the best low-alcoholic (under 3%) beer I ever tasted. Beers like this should be a lot more ubiquitous in Europe, allowing beer afficionados to have a few even if they have to drive a car...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
