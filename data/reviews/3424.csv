Appearance - deep brown with nice red chinks. If thered been more head itd have been a five. 
Nose - red and dark fruit tart. Figs and dates. 
Taste - sour cranberries and blackberries. 
Palate - medium bodied with a creamy yet tangy texture and a long dry sweet and sour finish. 
Overall - cracking sour. One of my favourite beers of the year.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"

3424,"2016-09-28",3.9,"Pours a deep burgundy color with a finger of khaki foam. Nose is full of boysenberry with some supporting dark fruits, vanilla and a hint of dark cocoa as well. Palate is viscous and has tons of acidity that carries the berry flavors into the lip puckering finish. Juicy and tart with some nice earthy sweet undertones to help keep it grounded.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
3424,"2016-08-22",4.0,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is very fruity with strong blueberry notes. Quite a bit of other berry character with some lighter raisin, cassis and plum. Light oak notes. Moderate caramel and toffee with lighter toasted bread notes. Hints of alcohol. 
Pours dark brown with a medium small, thick, dark tan head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges where a small amount lingers for a bit. No lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is fairly acidic and somewhat sharp. Medium malt notes with dark caramel, toffee and hints of toasted bread. Moderately strong blueberry notes. Lighter berry with some plum, raisin and cassis. Light oak notes. Palate adjusts to the acidity. Hints of alcohol. Lingering berry notes with acidity and toffee. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low, but present alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice Flanders Red with great berry notes. The blueberries work really well and dont really add any phenolic character. The acidity is a bit sharper than expected, but not bad at all. Nice malt and oak notes to balance out the acidity and fruit. Another nice Flanders style beer from the Bruery.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3424,"2016-07-10",4.2,"Another great bottle shared by Darrel, thank you! Pours a reddish purple color with a small ring of head. Nose is full of fruity boysenberry, oak, hints of sour/tart. Great sour impact with an intense amount of fruitiness. Clearly identified as boysenberries with sour and tart coming through strong. I notice little else maybe a hint of oak and vinous, but so much fruit and so good.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
3424,"2016-06-22",4.4,"750 ml bottle (2015) from my Reserve Society allocation poured into a tulip. Dark reddish brownish almost black color with some quick fading light tan head.

3424,"2016-06-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2016 June 10, 2016 - bottle via my membership. Dark pour slightly purple with some head that faded quickly. Aroma and taste of the regular but with a nice juicy berry twist.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
3424,"2016-04-07",4.0,"2015. 750ml bottle. The beer is a very dark maroon. Hard to see the color without direct light. The head is a very pale pink, nearly white and fairly fizzy. No lacing. Full of juicy boysenberries. Fruit sweet and sour with a light lacto note. Moderate balsamic vinegar. Some decently punchy oak. Moderate Flemish sour-style malt flavor in there; thankfully, it doesnt dominate the beer. I could use even more berries in the aroma, but its still very pleasant. The taste is medium to strongly tart, though its not overpowering like some version of Oude Tart. Lots of sour berry character. Fairly juicy. Little of that Flemish sour malt sweetness. Its mostly a sour berry juice burst. The beer is recognizably boysenberry, rather than other blackberry/raspberry family berries, and has that vegetal/earthy/almost fishy berry flavor, though not too strong like a De Garde beer or something. Light to medium body. Pretty big pucker. No booziness. This is a very nice version of Oude Tart.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3424,"2016-04-06",4.1,"Dark reddish purple in color... Aroma of dark fruits, berries, acetic... Flavor is leather, boysenberries, tart overripe stone fruits, oak... Really good

3424,"2016-01-18",3.9,"Pours almost black with dash of red in there. There is a brown head but gets eaten up before if gets to build. Smells like your usual bruery sour but with lots of boysenberries. Along with oak, vinegar, apples, and some cotton candy. The taste is almost all fruit. Its sour and juicy sweet. Lots of dark fruits, oak, boysenberries, some leather, limes and salt, with noticable malt. Ends with blueberry yogurt. Its thin, sour, and sweet.

3424,"2015-12-16",3.9,"Pours a deep, hazy purple on tap with thin ring of bubbly pink white head that leaves light lace. Aroma of fruit jelly with an overlying lactic and acetic sour note. Taste follows, big and acidic, but still some sweet berry notes, like a sour jam. Almost burns the tongue after the whole glass from the acidity, but not over the top in my opinion, I rather like it.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
3424,"2015-12-05",3.1,"750 ml bottle from the RS, thanks to our trustee for sending, AdamC for the purchase. Dark muddy brown with red highlights, no head. Aroma shows me tart berries, sour oak and vinegar. 
The flavor is pretty much the style. Funky oak, sour mash, borderline to much vinegar (right on that line), the berry note is pretty ok. The texture is almost juicy. Well it is drinkable so it not a total loss.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3424,"2015-12-05",3.2,"Bottle from last hoarders shipment. pour a few ounces as cellar temp. This has this cloudy reddish plus color. pretty pretty. The acidity is at 11. Very sharp, a lot of juiciness though. the boysenberry comes out well with a bit of cherry pie. Nice soft mouthfeel. Whoa, holy sour. Boysenberry is tart and this certainly adds a lot of juicy berry to an already sour beer. puckering almost. The base beer shines well. Its very sour. woody with cherry.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

3424,"2015-11-26",4.0,"Bottle. Dark purple in color with a thin pink head. Aroma of malt, berry and sour vinegar. Sour berry flavor, quickly turning to some maltiness before a very sour vinegar finish. Outstanding, but I wish the berry would stick around more. Looking forward to trying this one again after a year or two of shelf time.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
