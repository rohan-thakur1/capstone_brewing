1932,"2016-08-08",3.2,"On tap @ Henrik. This is a near clear looking one deep and amber bronze in color while on top, a hefty lacing beige head. It smells like soft red berries, mild English pub and a hint of some sweet malts. Not utterly exciting perhaps, but still quite nice. Tastes nice - and balanced. It has a good oily texture in the mouth and its almost creamy on the carbonation. Like the taste. It has a nice sweetness, really mellow and balanced, but not your typical ESB at all. Stronger and more mighty, quite nutty. Theres even a trace of something licoricy. Its surprisingly tasty this. 23.03.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
