7,"2016-04-01",3.8,"Sampled at RBSG 2010 Grand Tasting thanks to BBB63 from notes. Pours a hazy caramel brown color with a small beige head. The aroma is a wonderful collection of ripe fruits, caramel, and vanilla. The flavor is equally impressive with layers of ripe dark fruits, sweeter caramel malts, vanilla and some alcohol . There is no question this is a big beer, but it was too easy to drink.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

7,"2008-02-09",3.5,"Bomber.  Poured a slightly murky deep brown with very little head sticking around.. near flat.  The aroma picked up a bit of pina colada as David mentioned, with a touch of prickly fruit and cactus pairing with drawn, toasted caramel.. an overall air of sourness that I cannot pinpoint.. maybe a slight infection.  The flavor found more complexity, with chocolate, maple syrup, and some nuttiness joining at the core, and just a light earthy bitterness surrounding.. the back-end found bunches of coconut and light warmth.  Very low carbonation (if any) on the palate and lighter-bodied than Id expect.. warm finish, but nowhere near what I expected.  Dry at the end, and it warms the belly well.  Good stuff.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Some light candied fruit with maple syrup tossed in for good measure.  Dark murkey appearance with zero head.  For 13% alcohol, I taste nothing that would indicate its that high.  Not what I was expecting at all.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"
7,"2007-10-18",3.7,"This was listed on the board as Trippelweizenbock and had an ABV of 11.75% .  It pours a murky dark brown body with practically no head.  Hard to tell this was a wheat beer of any sort.  Its got a strong roasted aroma with some charcoal, maple syrup, and dark dried fruits.  The alcohol is very apparent in the flavor.  Youll also find some smoke, bittersweet chocolate, and dark caramel added to what carries over from the nose.  Boozey.

7,"2006-04-14",4.2,"Tawny garnet. Tiny-bubbled light brown head. Saliva inducing plum marmalade and black pepper aromas with hints of brandy, brown sugar, and molasses crusted pecans. Very minor whiff of alcohol. Still carbonation, but richly textured and slick. Rich wall of tangy molasses and black licorice initially greet the palate. Lightly dusty malts couple with a jammy slickness and moist tobacco to fend off the sweetness with ease. Alcohol is never a factor and manages to contribute but a hint of warmth. Doughy malts and a tangy fermented wheat notion embrace the leathery astringency which lends substantial depth. Layers upon layers of succulent fruitiness. Hugely beefy at the center and oh so soft with the daintiest touch of cookielike Munich which enhances the resounding silkiness. Finishes silky soft and remarkably mellow, yet still full of relentless malt girth, with a gentle brush of roast trailed by lingering notes of toffee and tobacco. This was such a joyful sipper.

Somewhat boozy aroma with a pleasant caramel maltiness, complimented by some vanilla bean, light chocolate nougat, english toffee, and a touch of Frangelico.  Smells a bit like a tasty after dinner dessert liquore that could best be enjoyed with fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.

7,"2006-03-18",4.1,"Hand bottled sample from the illustrious BigBadBear himself, shared with OldGrowth on 3/14/06 in a tulip at slightly below room tempThe beer is immensely dark, with a soy sauce-like appearance, quite viscous and with very low carbonation, not enough to form a head, but gives a small, deep tan ring of bubbles, and thick legs/residue on the glass.  A small head can be coaxed, however, upon swirling.  Unfiltered and nearly opaque.The nose opens up with strong, warming, sweet and rich molasses, soy, port and the signature weizen yeast fruit (bananas, apples) and of course some bubblegum, though its more a cotton candy sweetness, adding a feathery-light, lively note to the otherwise seriously intense sipper.  Maple, toffee, and just huge, sweet prunes and rich, amplified caramel.  Very strong, and one that you can sit and sniff for hours.  If there are flaws in the beer, I find none in the aroma.  Even a touch of dry, yeast notes and crusty brown bread.  I get a light hint of alcohol at one point, but it is fully passing, and even looking for it, Im not able to find it again.The flavor, perhaps, is not quite the sum of the aroma, being a bit too soy-like, almost peanut-pecan-like but otherwise full of rich chocolate, gritty, unfiltered wheat and roasted notes adding a balancing element, with bananas foster, caramelized sugars and tons of raisin, prune and light plum astringency.  Extremely low carbonation, but it works perfectly, giving a sweet sherry like mouthfeel, very soothing and nearly-syrupy.  The wheat works wonders on the palate, as always, in concert with the chocolate and caramel and even being balanced by light hints of earthy roast.  No alcohol whatsoever, in the flavor, even after fully warming and breathing.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

7,"2006-02-06",3.9,"From a growler, courtesy of BBB63 via MrFacto.  Thanks, guys!  Hazy and mostly opaque with gradient coloring, taking it from moderate chestnut hues to a light mahogany color scheme.  Quite the wallop of an aroma - concord grapes, blackberries and chocolate covered prunes.  Jam, yes, as in jelly sandwich on wheat bread.  Grapenuts with blueberries; maybe Wheaties with blueberries better defines the complex purple fruit and yeasty aroma.  Going from nose to mouth, a thick interlude draws upon plum pudding and boysenberries.  Some dried prunes, reminiscent of the ones sold in individual serving packets at the local grocery store.  Sweetly brown sugar glazed raisins.  No trace of alcohol content in the slightest sense.  Little, scarce reliance on fruity banana esters or clove spicing that typically plays a more dominant role in other renditions.  Chewy, bready palate load.  Full bodied, creamy wonderment.  Residual, syrupy black currant brings out the more portly aspects of the style when we wind down to the finish.  A tasty treat indeed.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
7,"2006-02-05",4.1,"Thick dark brown pour from the growler - ala Mike. Thin light tan lid of tiny bubbles. Huge aromas of over-ripe fruit. Prunes, plum and raisins all together and lightly stewed. Thick and lightly oily in feel. Deep heavy malt aromas abound under the fruit, with mild earthy sorghum and a touch of brown sugar. Just a hint of piney hops. Thick flavors go with the feel and aromas. More dark fruits and a touch of sweet pipe tobacco. Seems to be a cross between a hearty dubbel and an old ale that works in my book. I could curl up with this any dark and cold night and be warmed and comforted.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
7,"2006-01-28",4.3,"Snifter at brewpub: Nearly opaque with a hazel highlight that had almost no foam but did produce an oily film. The nose detected an array of esters and vapors. Plum, prune, banana, earthy yeast, sugar candi, toffee malts, sea salt, non-aromatic pipe tobacco all found in this  quite vinous like brew. The flavor profile starts first with acidic fruits interwoven with rich malts and sugar. Then a touch of salt and pepper comes forth before entering a yeasty, earthy and wheaty finish. A bit of phenols are detected and it is some what port like in its presentation.  This is dangerously drinkable with almost no note of the ABV hidden within.
