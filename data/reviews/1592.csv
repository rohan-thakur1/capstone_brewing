1592,"2013-05-12",3.2,"Bottle. Pours hazy light brown translucent. Aroma is caramelized brown rice, apples, and peppery alcohol. Flavor is sweet rice, light brown rice notes, cooked apples and a dry finish. Full body.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1592,"2012-12-16",2.9,"Pours a light yellowish tinge...slightly cloudy. Smells like....sake. There are some sweet milk chocolate aromas and flavours. But the booze is more prevelant than any other flavours.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","cards04"
1592,"2012-03-24",3.9,"Pours a cloudy white. The aroma is that of spiced milk. This is a food saki through and through. The silk and banana pronounce themselves when indulging in spicy and salty food. The rice base helps calm down spicier food yet this saki still has a great characteristic on its own. Have with food and be super pleased!!!","Georgia, USA","DrinkEmUpJones"

1592,"2010-07-04",3.5,"Pours a hazy, white hued light golden,  Aroma is sweet, estery and fruity with some notes of banana and sweet melon most most prevalent.  rich and chewy in the mouth with some anise-like bitterness and a nice light burn in the finish, slightly warming.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
1592,"2009-06-14",2.2,"Glows a white glow.  smells of stinky funk, maybe a bit grassy and some alcohol too.  Flavors arent sweet but are a bit bitter...lacking in any tangible fruit notes unfortunately..not sweet either...just kind of bitter fungus...nothing really sticks...just kind of a messy alcoholic fungus. damn it...I was reading ratings while i purchased this and the higher rating people freaking lied, especially about the sweetness, which this lacks altogether...and it really needs some sweetness to round out that funky alcoholic fungus deathtrap.  This really isnt enjoyable in any way...The bitterness is completely off puting...rather expensive too.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1592,"2009-02-21",3.0,"Pours an milky yellow color. Notes of creme, coconut milk, rice and fruit. Mouthfeel is sub par. Overall not very good.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1592,"2009-02-20",2.9,"Bottle, room temp. Pours a murky yellow, unpleasant hue with a few particles. Looks like something a man (well at least most men) would not want to drink. Aroma is sweet withe koji, banana, alcohol and vanilla. Fusel alcohol on the taste, sweet with almonds, nutty, koji. Not super balanced. some umami. Syrupy mouthfeel.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1592,"2008-05-17",2.2,"Not high on my list for a nigori. Some what dry wilth an alcoholic taste. Not much else on this one.","California, USA","bill1958"
1592,"2008-01-31",2.3,"Its about what you expect form a standard nigori, its got a cloudy white head, high alcohol with ricey overtones and mild fruit flavor.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1592,"2008-01-31",2.2,"The aroma is very ricey with alcohol. The appearance is hazy white. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is chalky. Overall its OK but thats all.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1592,"2007-11-14",3.5,"Chilled bottle from Party Source. Poured cloudy white pour with sticky legs. Moderate coconut and melons aroma. Medium body with a creamy texture. Medium tart fruit and rice flavor with a medium sweet finish with a warming burn of moderate duration. My expectations were met.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1592,"2007-09-17",3.5,"Served shaken and chilled.  Milky, cloudy, greyish-white body.  The surface shows a faint appearance of a slightly oily film.  Scents of light melon, coconut, Irish cream, and lemon make for an appealing aroma.  The flavor starts out light and creamy, with ample coconut sweetness.  Tart lemon adds a nice balance to the typical Nigori sweetness.  The alcohol is detectable, though not unpleasant.  The bittersweet finish is long and slightly drying.  Smooth, average Nigori palate.  Nice option for spicy sushi.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1592,"2007-03-15",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2007 Bottle drunk on 3/10/07Typical nigori color (milky white), with no head and moderate legs left on the glass.  Medium amount of sediment overall.Much more lightly-fruited aroma (and flavor) than other nigoris Ive had.  Dosent have as many dull rice husk and coconut-like notes, but in place seems to almost have a citrus and passion fruit-like zestiness.  Lots of some type of tropical fruit, anyways.  Not as thickly creamy-sweet either, leaving more of a perfuminess to linger.  Medium-strong aroma, to boot, with light alcohol nuances, but quite controlled for its size.Very impressive flavor is full of nectarine and tangerine fruitiness, with softly stinging alcohol underneath.  Pineapple-coconut is reserved, relatively speaking (its always going to be quite prominent) and  allows the esters to really come alive.  The mouthfeel was wonderful as well, and I fully agree with Jjpm74 that it didnt have nearly as much graininess as many other nigoris.  This made for a more fluid, traditional sake-like mouthfeel (though dont get me wrong, its still unfiltered).  Sweet, probably too much so in the end, but very drinkable and surprisingly controlled in the alcohol.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1592,"2007-03-03",3.7,"Pours milky like a watery soy drink.  Smells of vanilla, rice, alcohol and sweet coconuts.  Tastes of vanilla, rice hulls and alcohol.  Moutfeel isnt as grainy as the other Nigori sakes Ive tried.  Finish shows elements of slick sweet coconut and leaves a sweet taste in the mouth.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1592,"2006-10-04",3.4,"Pours white and cloudy with a bit of sediment. Aroma is sweet and wispy, a bit alcoholic. Taste is sweet and fruity, some bananas as mentioned by Kevin, but also finishes with a slight alcoholic bite. Mouthfeel is creamy and like a full bodied wine. One of the best sakes Ive tried thus far.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
1592,"2005-05-04",2.6,"white and milky, well just like watered down milk. aroma is alcohol, taste is sweet with some, well fishy taste. finish is bananaq and something similar to an orange mixed with a lot of water.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
