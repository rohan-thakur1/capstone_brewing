888,"2009-10-14",3.6,"Bottle Clear, light yellow sake with fantastic, centipede-like legwork nicer legs than a runway model. The aroma is funky and sweet  sweaty sock and sorghum  also boozy and hot. Full-bodied and oily. The flavor is of sweet ethanol and is a touch earthy. Sweet finish offers a little molasses and wood.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

888,"2008-09-02",2.9,"Thanks for sharing, csbosox. The body was pale yellow with some floral sweetness. There was also very apparent alcohol and some rice. A nice perfume note runs through the whole nose. The taste had some slightly sweet notes of pear juice and rice. There was also some subtle wood and sugar hints. A decent drink.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

888,"2008-05-08",4.1,"Bottle courtesy of Bman1113VR. My first genshu. Pours clear with a faint yellow hue. Best legs I have ever seen on a sake, very persistant. Nose is sweet and fruity with rice and alcohol and some bananas. Taste is sweet and banana esque but alcoholic which leads us to conclude ""bananas foster"". Very smooth and drinkable, freakisly so at 18%. Nice warming finish. Very nice.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
888,"2008-05-08",3.9,"Wow this is underated. First genshu for me an I enjoyed it quite a bit. Drank with ilovedarkbeer.  Pours clear with amazingly strong, long lasting legs. Aroma of sweet rice, quite a lot of fruit, vanilla and some bananans and mild pineapple. Taste is very sweet and smooth, with well concealed alcohol. Very smooth mouthfeel, somewhere in between creamy and syrupy.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
888,"2008-04-09",3.6,"Very cool packaging.  Pours clear and quite yellowish.  The still, thin looking body doesnt leave much in terms of legging on the cup.  Aromas of cream, koji, almond oil, and alcohol comprise the nose.  The flavor is very alcoholic, warming the tongue and intensifying on the finish.  Vodka-esque notes linger on the tongue for ages.  Cream, koji, and faint melon notes all come through quite sweet.  The viscous body is more substantial than it looks.  Enjoyable, if youre up for a stiff sake.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
888,"2008-03-10",2.7,"Bottle: Misty clarity, noticeable yellow chardonnay color, thick bulbous legs. Nose of strong koji, popcorn kernels, almond, orange pith, alcohol. The flavor has tremendous impact with a ton of alcohol, koji but light acidity in comparison for the thick chewy body. Dry tail but the alcohol sticks. Some cantaloupe notes in the tail. Brash and masculine. Interesting. Thanks a ton to Boboski for randomly giving me a bottle of this asking nothing in return. What a gent!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
888,"2007-12-23",4.0,"750 generously provided by Boboski. Pours a lightly murky yellow color, like green grape juice or almond oil. Thick legs run down the side of the viscous drink. Nice koji, melon rind aroma. Very round, balanced aroma. Flavor has a nice sweetness, rice, mild alcohol burn. Very smooth and goes down great. Thanks, Jason!","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
888,"2007-09-24",3.7,"Pour is light yellow like vegetable oil...smell is strongly sweet and alcoholic...light fruit and leather...taste is strongly sweet and perfume like...lots of light fruit sweetness (pears) and hints of almonds...strong alcohol in the finish, but a delight still!","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
888,"2007-09-05",3.0,"The third and final sake in our flight at Indras Mead, Cider and Sake Tasting on 8/31/07. Pours light, flat and clear like a Riesling. The aroma is of banana, steamed rice and alcohol. Light, smooth and lightly dry, this one finishes fairly ""hot"". The flavor follows the nose with the alcohol standing out quite a bit more in this one. Compared to the first two, this was a bit on the harsh side of the spectrum. I enjoyed the flavor, but the alcohol heat detracted from the overall effect.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
888,"2007-09-01",3.0,"Third Sake of the night at the Indra - Cider, Sake and Mead tasting 8/31/07.  Pour looks like Chardonnay.  Aroma is sweet boozy rice.  Taste is very hot, with rice sweetness.  Taste is normal Sake, though the heat really jumps out at you.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
888,"2007-06-12",2.5,"The aroma has rice, alcohol, and wood. The appearance is clear yellow. The flavor is crisp and slightly sweet with a dry finish. The palate is oily and thin with a spicy finish. This sake is not overly strong to be 18% alcohol making it very drinkable.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
888,"2007-06-12",3.4,"this is a specisl treat for me. this sake at first sip seems a bit flat, but the it hits you hard at the end with a spicy, wooden flavor. this is a sake for Japanesse royality","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
888,"2007-01-04",2.2,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop,  served chilled, poured a clear colored body and no head or any bubbles at all. The aroma was almost non-existant with only mild plastic notes noted.  The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a strong vinous alcohol aftertaste. The thin flavor contained notes of plastic and was mildly vinous. Not one that I would likely buy again.  And yes I too had to give it an extra appearance point for the bamboo wrapper with rope ties.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
888,"2006-08-11",4.2,"Off yellowish clear. Nose of candied light fruits (apples, pears, peaches) and sweet licorice. Same flavors with a subtle, crisp, wood like spice; detectable rice; spring water; subtle, almost invisible alcohol; and a burnt sugar/grain aftertaste. Simple and complex at the same time. Palate like heavy, sweet water. Excellent. Extra appearance point for the badass rice paper wrapper.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
888,"2006-04-09",3.8,"cool package sake that looks like a tamale!
pours clear with  ""twinge of yellow"" from crazyvin.I got earthy cantalopes in the smell and taste .Its slightly thicker than my previous sakes It  stayed on your tongue a bit longer .It is very strong and hot at first mellowing and quite enjoyable after about the third shot.Expensive but worth sharing especially with some california rolls and a few friends","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","beerhandy"
888,"2005-12-11",3.8,"truly the best sake i have had so far. poured a clear color with a twinge of yellow. Alcohol and citrus notes on the nose, great flavor sweet notes mixed with apple and honey. Really smooth and the alcohol was well hidden.  paid $28for this bottle.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
888,"2004-04-16",3.6,"(500ml Bottle) This lasted a full 4 days on the LCBO-King Edward shelves. Expensive at $30 but hey, I'm hard up for something new. Pours pale and clear. Nose is more citrus to me than orange. Thin flavour with a honey-burn finish. Big difference between a 14% ABV and a 18% ABV. Very good.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
888,"2004-03-05",3.8,"Coming soon to Toronto...Very pallid colour.  Aroma is leathery, orangey, alcoholic, phenolic (paint thinner)...very muscular.  ""Heaven's Mountain""  has a slight tartness and a big alcohol finish.  This is balanced by a strong underlying sweetness.  Leaves honey, wood, apple skin, and coriander seed on the tongue. Bold, brash.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
