Sizable offwhite head atop is frothy, a nice full filmy layer with a thick ringer that sticks around nicely. Aromas are tart and punchy, sour raspberry immediately inflames the senses with potent lactic twang, oak and cobwebs. Mellow toasty and carmelized malts with fall beind as big seedy raspberry, subtle red wine and earthy elements meet a metallic and yogurty twang. Raspberries dominate the nose, potent and lush, seedy and fleshy with a tannic appeal that melds with the barrel, mellow funk and a malt body that doesnt offer too much behind. Initial is lots of raspberry, nice tartness and seedy appeal meet subtle toast and biscuit, yogurt and vanilla. Sour raspberries, macerated and dried out. Just enough sweetness to remind as that punchy sour lactic appeal, lingering tannic skin and oak work in some gentle cocoa, toast and biscuity appeal behind. Mellow funk, pleasant and driving raspberry elements sustain. This one is sour but even keeled, the raspberries do the work largely but have a synergy here. Never acidic or harsh, this one gives some nice fluffs of biscuit and toast, mellow oak and lots of seedy raspberry tart and dry skin appeal. Pleasant stuff. Not the prettiest pour but a really on point nose, good flavors and flow, nothing overwhelming and a good gentle touch from the darker malt base.

3405,"2015-07-30",4.2,"750, corked and foiled (I think). Thanks, J! Damn, what a delightful surprise. Pours an opaque dark brown with no head or lacing at all. Big bright sharp nose thats definitely a unified, balanced element, rather than an impressionist painting with its disparate colors--showing clear fresh raspberries but layered back through oak and a bit of balsamic-y tang. Absolutely coherent and nuanced. Creamy medium body with minimal carb. Mild sharpness on the attach from the acid content, hard to tell if its more fruit or more funk in nature. Oak is there, funk is there, fruit is there, its all so, so, so good. These guys are just killin it to death every time they slap a name on a bottle.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Lots of raspberries with a good mix of sour and sweet, so mostly sour. Light funk and moderate oak. Taste is nice but the fruit gets a bit muddled and doesnt quite have the bright jammy flavor of the aroma. Tart berries with underripe apricots. Some sour grape-iness. Light oak. Fairly dry.

Taste follows aroma closely with tart raspberry, cherry pits, some red wine vinegar and lemon. The body is light with nice bubbly carbonation. Definitely fruit forward on the finish and a little dry.
