1660,"2017-05-03",3.6,"On tap at Westside. It poured a brown color with a tan head. The aroma was of toast, cocoa, molasses and coffee. It tasted similar to the aroma with more toast, cocoa, molasses, coffee, smoke and some roastiness. Good stuff.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
1660,"2016-06-21",3.4,"Pours a deep brownish black on tap with fluffy tan head that dissipates to leave moderate lace. Aroma of dark roasted malt, bakers chocolate, and a hint of earthy tobacco.

1660,"2014-03-09",3.3,"On tap at the Westside location.
Unexceptional looks and feel. Seems a bit light in body even for style. 
Light but adequate carbonation. 
Generous load of dark roasted malts.
Slightly above average bitterness for style, probably due to the level of dark roasted grain.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
1660,"2014-03-02",3.6,"Had a half pour on their 8th anniversary. Thick black with substantial head. Like thick milkshake goodness head. Everything on this was subdued, but all worked together for a light enjoyable stout. Cocoa, malt, coffee, light sweet. Good stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
1660,"2014-02-23",3.3,"On tap at the west side location. Pours deep walnut with nearly no head. Aroma is roasted malt and a touch of espresso. Taste is semisweet with a bitter dry finish. Picking up a bit more coffee and bittersweet chocolate than in the taste vs the aroma. Body is medium, but on the flat side. An OK stout.","Roswell, Georgia, USA","deaconmike"
1660,"2012-05-24",3.5,"Poured a pitch black with little head. Aroma contains chocolate, grapes, licorice. The flavor is malty with some chocolate and vanilla but also sour with grapes and raisins.

1660,"2010-02-24",3.0,"Serving: Draft at the brewpub.
It pours an opaque black with a creamy tan head.  The nose is very roasty with notes of coffee and wood.  The flavor is full of molasses, almost to the point of being overpowering.  It is also cloyingly sweet.  Some flint and roasted malt comes out as the beer continues to work.  This one strikes me as a one note wonder.  A medium mouthfeel and a medium finish dont leave anything to write home about.  I would like this brew better if they took their foot off the sweetness pedal.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Overall Impression: 
A nice dark brown body. This one has a very creamy feel to it.  There are roasted malts, and chocolate.  It is quite smooth and easy drinking.  A nice beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
1660,"2009-08-04",3.4,"Kind of disappointing, pours a deep dark black.  Some bready toasty notes, with a bit of dried cocoa powder, and some roasted coffee beans.  Quite dry on the palate, but smooth and creamy, but kind of non - descript.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
1660,"2009-08-02",3.7,"Tap.  Dark brown, almost black.  This is really good considering this is my least favorite stout style.  Aroma is toasty and full of molasses, cocoa and some coffee.  Flavor is fuller than most dry stouts, but it is dry.  Lots of toasted malt and molasses.  And a good dose of medium roast coffee with some chocolate.  Good beer.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

Pours a dark chocolate brown with light showing through as mahogany around the edges. The head is small and tan, dissipating very quickly and leaving no lacing.

The aroma fairly straight forward with lots of roasted malts with hints of both dark chocolate and coffee.

The taste follows the aroma pretty closely and has the requisite dark roasted malts and semi-sweet chocolate. There is also the faintest hint of fruity sweetness in the background but this is quickly forgotten with a very dry finish.

The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied but still very creamy and with minimal carbonation.

This is a solid and extremely drinkable example of an Irish stout. Nothing really stands out about, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

1660,"2008-04-26",3.9,"This is a very aggressive dry stout. Dry stout often means bland, but this has a ton of roast and a bit of that ashy flavor that some coffee stouts end up with, but only a touch. Very tasty stout.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1660,"2008-04-15",3.7,"On tap. Pours fairly black with a nice head. Weve got an oaty, dense nose with suggestions of chocolate, light coffee, and a tiny ashiness. The body is surprisingly creamy and smooth. I get bitter ash, velvety chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee. The finish is dry with an almost sour twinge. Very well done. What a delightful take on a session beer like this.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
1660,"2008-04-04",3.8,"Appearance: Black body with a small, light tan head.

Smell: Aroma of roasted malts with full accents of coffee and Dutch chocolate.

Taste: Dry, roasted maltiness with a taste of unsweetened chocolate and coffee. Brief, and I do mean brief flashes of toffee and roasted nuts. Puff of smoke. The beer never offers much sweetness. Just a touch of faint sourness on the smokey, dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: A solid dry stout, indeed!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
