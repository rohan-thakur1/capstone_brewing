An earthy orange nose accents the cloudy glow of this beer contents. I can tell this is pretty fresh, since this becomes bit of a sweet syrup bomb with some age (still very good IMO). It has a full palate with a dominate semi-sweet grapefruit flavor. The bitterness tends to linger in the mouth, which may compliment certain food pairings. What these pairings may be, I dont know. Overall very good. Yet something I dont get too worked up about, and get when it presents itself at the appropriate time.","","balloonbuffoon"

1160,"2017-01-26",4.8,"Bells Hopslam is one of those beers that transcends categories. Its more than just a good representative of its style. More than just a good beer. Its a goddamn piece of art. Is it an intensely hoppy ale that showcases six aggressive Pacific American cones? Is it an approachable brew? Somehow, its both. Honey and orange blossom aromas. Caramel and honey flavors form the malty backbone while floral, citrusy hops come out in full force. For being a hop-forward beer at 10%, it shouldnt be beautiful, so perfectly balanced. Yet, it is.

Aromas are crisp candied orange and caramel with some light tropical pineapple, apricot and pine. Its quite a sweet DIPA but that should have been expected with ale brewed with honey. I get a quick hit of bitterness to start before it turns sweet with caramel, honey, pineapple and orange. The finish is bitter again with grapefruit mixed in with some honey. Mid to full bodied with light carbonation. Overall this was nice, but maybe my expectations were too high and it was perhaps just a bit too sweet for me.

1160,"2016-03-03",3.9,"Was able to get a six pack of this after trying for several years. Pours a somewhat hazy orange with lots of fluffy head that hangs around. The one thing that stands out about this beer is the lacing which is the best I have ever seen. Aroma is sweet and much different than the typical west coast style imperials. The sweetness from the honey is evident and so is some booze. There is also subtle pine and citrus but definitely not as in your face as other beers of this style. Taste is pine and citrus (almost candied) with ample amounts of caramel malt and hints of alcohol. Overall this beer is very well balanced. Medium to full bodied. Despite the noticeable alcohol this beer is surprisingly easy to drink. I am glad I was finally able to try this but it does not deserve all of the praise. It is a nice beer but the hype is not justified and I think is more the result of being one of the early big beers (when competition was limited) and also the rarity.","Delaware, USA","GSH1976"

I have never cared enough to try it or seek it out. It kind of fell into my lap at the store so I decided its time. I have nothing to compare this to which actually made me happy because I didnt have any pre-conceived opinions about it. It smells like an absolute dank peach. Thats all I can describe it as. A super ripe sweet dank peach. It tastes wonderful. The honey adds something that you dont get unless you....brew an ipa with honey. Its very sweet but there is so much hops packed into it, it doesnt become cloying or weird. Big peach and tropical flavor. I really enjoyed it. Would I run back out and buy another 6 pack for 22 bucks? Ehhh no. But was it worth trying? Absolutely and its very good. I would like to try it on draft if I ever find it again.

Drinking it brought forth an intense bitterness with some sweetness at the end, which I guess is from the honey, but I couldnt place a flavor to it other than a moderate sweetness. This beer was very herbal and vegetal. It was like bitter liquified vegetable matter with some grapefruit and citrus mixed in. There was a medium heavy mouthfeel and full carbonation.

Went out Friday night to pick up some beer and grabbed a 12 pack of this, as well. Right from the nose, you know this is an IPA, but less of the bitter scent. As soon as it hits your tongue, especially on the first sip, you get a nice sweetness and then the hops engulf your tongue, triggering all the buds into a euphoric state with grapefruit teasing in a mellow way. The slight sweetness hangs on the palate, balancing the bitters that are fighting to get free. All the while, the alcohol burn subsides to an almost cooling feel.  This a really enjoyable ale.

1160,"2016-01-02",4.7,"This brew is fairly foamy with a 2 finger head poured from a 12oz bottle. This one is a hazy copper color. There is nice lacing after the head recedes.

Very rich and caramelly smelling. Strong hop aroma here (citrus and pine). There is a slight savory/buttery scent.

There is a powerful kick of hop bitterness at first, but not over the top. The bitterness is quickly overcome by rich, sweet, syrupy, buttery, caramel flavors!!!! The deep roasted malt flavors are very woodsy and nutty. After the sweet caramel flavors wear off, this beer fades back to a bitter hop flavor and it starts to dry off. You are left with pine and a slight smoky after taste.

Fairly full bodied for a hoppy ale. Thicker than I expected - a bit slick and syrupy. There is a drier finish though.

This is a very good beer. Better than anticipated. I saw that this beer has been rated in the top beers of the country, so I had to check it out. I live in Colorado, but grew up in Michigan. My only regret is that I wasnt a beer fan when I lived in Michigan so I never tried any Bells or Founders beers. I have had 4-5 beers from Bells and am very impressed. I highly recommend this brew to any hop head.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","sjdevel"

1160,"2015-11-20",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2016 Classic and highly acclaimed Bells beer, thanks very much Marie for bringing me this bottle from NYC! Medium thick, membranously lacing, pale greyish white, moussy head over a hazy, warm orange blonde beer. Attractive, spicy aroma of toasted onion, cedar needles, mango, overripe papaja with the same kind of subtle smokiness, roasted peanuts, baked banana, acacia honey, gin, hay, gingerbread, dry cake, grapefruit flesh, strawberry wine, almond, white pepper. Vividly fruity onset, mango and papaja again, persimmon, lychee, smooth and sweetish but balanced with a basic kind of sourishness and upcoming bitterness, but subtly so; soft carbo, very supple middle phase with bready and toasted malts mingled with a kind of spicy sweetness very recognizable as being artisanal honey, the kind I remember from childhood, continuing well into the throat; there it is dried by a wave of hops, piney and citrusy retronasally as well as bittering, but relatively softly so and less corrosive than in many other DIPAs. As a result of this play of toasted malts, complexely aromatic and well-bittering but rounded hops and honey, the finish is very long and satisfying - adding another dimension to the beer. Alcohol remains very well hidden, except perhaps for a certain gin-like warmth in the back of the throat. I like IIPAs when they are balanced with sweet malts and this one cleverly adds another layer to that with the use of honey. Impressive and very rich American ale (not even labelled by the brewery as a IIPA apparently...).","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Not much of a head, but it sticks nicely to the glass and leaves some wisps on the surface. Citrusy from a distance (literally, from a few feet away), but its got a dose of pine as I smell it more. Great aroma. A lot of sweetness behind it. Caramel and booze. The hop flavor delivers in the front. Its a huge wave of hops that recedes as dramatically as it hits. The citrus gives way to pine, much in the way of the aroma, which gives way to a hefty malt and honey sweetness. Not cloying and not even all that sweet, but its amazing how much the hops disappear. It still tastes pretty damn good, but not like the best IPAs out there. The finish is boozy and slightly bitter. After the hops drop off, the booze is pretty evident. Theres an astringency presumably from the fermented honey. Its not really bitter, either, but still the bitterness is one of the only flavors that lingers. I used to think this beer was the bees knees of IPAs, but having had far more interesting hop profile IPAs, this one hasnt quite risen to its lofty heights as of late.

1160,"2015-04-05",3.8,"This Hopslam was a surprise from a friend, and Im excited about trying it, having had no experience before with any Bells Brewery other than their Dark Note. If youve had the Dark Note, youll understand why Im so excited about the Hopslam. Lots of brew comes with a big reputation, and I generally go in a bit cynical, just to be on the safe side.
I crack the cap, pour the brew into a tulip and watch the deep, soft head rise to the top. It grows thick, eggshell white and sits right on top of the aroma, masking it with its density. I actually have to sip it off the top to get the aroma to really come through.
Grapefruit and pine with an accent of barely ripened mango on the nose,and as I sip down, that mango actually comes alive. Im surprised to actually find that dollop of honey - big as life, and toning the bitterness. The flavor of the honey is undeniably the most apparent flavor in the brew.
The full body is very appropriate for a DIPA, the carbonation lively but not buzzy, and the stickiness becoming quite apparent as I drain the glass. The foam clings to the sides of the glass as the level of the beer drops, leaving behind a thick sheet of white lace. The finish is fairly short for an Imperial IPA and as much as I was expecting to have a nasty bit on my tongue from the first sip, the balance is just too good. No bite. I like a bite. Instead, I find a hard edge on the back of my tongue thats trying really hard to be a bitter hop experience, but not making it...quite.
Its a really solid brew, but not my favorite experience. Im enjoying the hell out of the honey, but as for a Double IPA, I can find better.","USA","lightbias"

I am extremely fortunate that a beer loving friend rescued this wondrous elixir from falling into the clutches of someone who mightnt appreciate it as I do.

Potent yet smooth notes of sweet caramel and biscuits mingle magnificently with pink grapefruit, lemon, Bartlett pears, a touch of pine and some light tropical fruitiness. With every divine dip into this hoppy pool I must remind myself that this is a 10% ABV juggernaut of imperial proportions; no alcohol flavour is present, only a well balanced but teetering on hop-forward greatness.

2015 vintage

Pours a big, froth head, with tiny, crystallic bubbles in it, while the beer has a clean, darker amber, orange color.

The aromas contain a big load of tropical hops, featuring peach, mango and blood orange, which are utmost juicy and ripe. This gets balanced by bready, slightly biscuity malts, accentuating a zingy, glazed lemon peak on top of the distinct fruitiness. The nose is very rich and intriguing, as it is bursting with mellow, luscious tropical fruits, very well compounded.

Taste begins with crisp lime among bready malts, while the beer drinks very smooth. A vivid kiwi prickling gets added to the taste, as well as more lime and sunny, louche grapefruit. Honey is certainly noteable, while the alcohol is not detectable at all, and it provides the fruity hops with a ripe, sappy note, as it leads the malt flavor closer to the hops by adding a striking biscuity quality to them. The beer doesnt turn sweet though, it is still centered around the hoppiness, which is yet evolving on the palate. A distinct, slick bitterness arises from the fruitiness, leading to a slightly dry, long lasting finish, continously using the hops as center of attraction, exhibiting a slightly piney note, blending smooth into the sapful fruits. The carbonation still adds a slightly refreshing impression, while the beer is heavier bodied, without loosing its typical IPA drinkability, ending with a unique honeyed, hoppy finish.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1160,"2015-02-21",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2015 Looks like Im about the last regular on Ratebeer to not rate this beer. Its not my first time having Hopslam; about eight years ago (pre-RateBeer days), before anyone in Louisville seemed to know about it, I picked up a bottle at World Market. Considering that the most extreme IPA Id had to that point was 60 Minute, it was a mind blowing experience at the time, expanding my idea of what beer could be exponentially. So, here I am in 2015, and ""Session IPA"" is the vogue thing (which is a positive thing in my view). Since I dont stand in crazy lines for releases, I had to wait until Hopslams popularity waned a bit. Now is that time, in Louisville at least. Ive seen it on the shelves in almost every legit shop Ive walked into recently, so I finally decided, after eight years, to give this beer another try. Not sure why I felt the need to type all of that. Aroma: Herbaceous honey peach wine. Appearance: light copper pour with a sticky white head that settles into a slight skin. Flavor: Matches the nose; a little more herbaceous up front, but peachy throughout and moreso in the finish; not as bitter as I expected it would be, and fairly smooth for its 10% ABV. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: I like this; its a fairly intense beer, but its never so abrasive as to be undrinkable. I can see why people get into it.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

Rich heavy medium body with a texture that is both oily and creamy. Slightly above normal carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.

The World Class flavor profile is quite intense, very complex and reasonably balanced. It begins with a slam of grapefruit that slowly takes on a pine character. As the hop flavor fades, the rich biscuit and honey sweetness comes to the forefront. In the middle, a mild bitterness takes the lead. A blend of the above slowly fade and jostle for prominence going into the finish.

Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Some light booziness shows up as it warms. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon/orange zest, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA style. All around awesome complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV.

Appearance: brilliant clarity with a golden/orange color and a thin white head that dissipated quickly. 
Aroma: A punch of citrus with notes of orange and peach, with an underlying grassy, piney base. 
Taste: Really rich and sweet maltiness, almost candy like, with definitive citrus flavors. Resinous, strong hop bitterness slowly builds and comes to a crescendo after the swallow. 
Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body with a low carbonation and a hint of alcohol warmth. 
Finish: Bitterness and dryness grows after the swallow and lingers with some resin on the tongue. 
Overall: Very light and balanced for a double IPA, with the richness of the malt standing up to the hops. This causes the bitterness to slowly increase as opposed to an abrasive punch in the face. Aroma is complex and inviting. Great IIPA.","","TH28"

I cant tell you whether my palate is ""more sophisticated"" or what but old favorite IPAs like Hopslam definitely no longer carry the flag for the style. I would argue that even a routinely available beer like Kane Overhead is now superior to Hopslam. From 12/4/14: In September 2008, I went to Three Floyds for a great dinner, leaving with a case of Alpha King, but somehow only one Dreadnaught. The next day I rolled into the Bells Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo, late enough that the kitchen was closed. So the story went, they had brewed a special batch of Hopslam for some occasion and so thats how I came to have two glasses of it on tap. The beer was the only good thing about the visit though. I have been welcomed more warmly by employees of the Motor Vehicle Commission. Whatever it was I should have done to get in the bartenders good graces, I did not do.

1160,"2014-05-18",4.5,"Poured from bottle into a snifter

Appearance  It had a deeper golden color with a slight bit of haze. The head upon serving was relatively small and faded to give a moderate level of lacing.

Smell  The hops hit you from afar and hit hard. Big citrus and pine hops greet the nose with a nice aroma. These then mellow a bit as a maltier and sweeter aroma of caramel and bread mix in with the citrus and pine. Toward the very end of the smell there is a bit of floral that manages it way in to the aroma, although it is quite light in comparison the pine and citrus.

Taste  The taste follows the nose quite well. There is a nice more bitter citrus and pine taste upfront with is mixed quite nicely with a big malty backbone of some bready and biscuit flavors. As the taste moves forward it sweetens up with some sweeter fruit and caramel flavors coming into play. Toward the end it all comes together and leaves a very satisfying somewhat bitter, somewhat sweet flavor in the mouth. Quite pleasant.

Mouthfeel  A moderate to thicker body with a slightly lighter then normal carbonation level give this brew a nice creamy feel and allow the taste to linger and permeate the tongue.

Overall  This was a nice imperial IPA. It had great aromas flavor and mouthfeel. One to look for and one to sit back and savor.","","Darkmagus82"

Alcohol is well masked. Full flavored and well balanced. Does not have too much of the resin hop finish. The sweets seem to balance that out. I put this a notch below the top DIPA's.

1160,"2014-03-15",4.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 1/17/14 and came as part of a six-pack for $18.99 ($3.17 per bottle or $0.26 per ounce).

Appearance: Hazy shade of orange/amber. Some carbonation visible. Pours to a large, off-white, foamy head which laces and retains well.

Smell: Strong hop aroma of resin and stone fruit (strawberries?), with minor alcohol present.

Taste: I first tried Bells Hopslam back in 2010 and have not had the opportunity to drink it again until now. Its not quite as I remembered, though Id venture to guess the recipe has evolved over time so its probably a different brew every year. And while this beer garners a lot of acclaim (read: hype), I dont think its quite the 100/100 beer it scores on ratebeer.com. Dont get me wrong, its still a very good beer, but there are better ones.

Since this is a big-bodied beer, its no surprise theres a discernible malt character right away. Plenty of pale/amber malts as well as a strong honey component create for a rich, almost sticky sweetness right off the bat. Theres some orange juice concentrate as well, coupled with a strong, but gentle alcohol warmth. Through the middle and on the finish the hops come rushing in full force. Theyre of the piney/resiny type, or some kind of citrus extract as theyre more dank and chewy than crisp and tart. They leave a dry, starchy aftertaste, which is also accentuated by the alcohol. Im not sure why this beer has to be this huge, though. Id think a slightly leaner version would be a little more palatable, but this is still a great example of the double IPA style.

Drinkability: Weighing in at 10% ABV, Bells Hopslam is not a beer to be taken lightly. Though its definitely lighter and more drinkable than youd think. The mouthfeel is thick and soft, but with a smooth texture that goes down surprisingly easy. The alcohol is a definite factor to this beers character, but its not distracting. This is a beer to enjoy as the annual treat that it is.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1160,"2014-02-14",4.0,"I havent seen anything quite like this. Thats saying something. Ive been in this strange wine/beer and spirits business for the last eight years. The frenzy this beer caused was astonishing. In fact it was by pure blind luck that I was able to snag a six. It happened to be my first day on the job in the nations premier proprietor of alcoholic beverages. We were allocated 20 cases of this stuff, it ran for 23.99 a six. We attempted to regulate it as best we could. One six pack per customer. We got it on Monday and it didnt even make it to the end of the day. 9 out of every 10 calls we got was regarding this sudsy pariah. This beer is one of those rare ones that drive people to cross state lines with duffle bags full of unmarked bills. Now on to the topic at hand. HOPSLAM. It pours a hazy orange/amber. Aromatic pour with an insane head, abundant lacing. Medium bodied bordering on a light crisp beer, the 10% alcohol content is well concealed. For something called Hopslam, whose label depicts a man being crushed to death by a hop the size of a Fiat it comes up moderate on the hop/IBU scale. I actually liked the beer due in part by the creaminess and harmony of the hops used. Grapefruit, pines and a dash of honey put it at the front of the IPA pack. Overall a great beer, though I hope I dont have to drop that kind of cheddar again for a beer.","USA","JOHNCONOR"
1160,"2014-02-13",4.5,"Solid light head. Medium ace. Sweet citrus hoppy aroma. Clean clear cloudy apperance. Exceptional taste with hints of honey. Not overly bitter. Overall an above average exceptional IPA tjat should be saught after and enjoyed.","Washington DC, USA","Russ2079"
1160,"2014-02-13",5.0,"Pours very clear light orange color with big bubble 1"" head. Head holds on really well with nice lacing. Smells very hoppy with nice floral aroma, and also pick up some nice citrus. Taste is citrus and hop with great heat form the alcohol. Also taste honey which I think gives is a smoother finish than some other dbl IPAs. Mouthfeel is complex with big bitter form the hop and citrus to sweetness form the honey. Beer is silky and well carbonated. 

Overall, I just love this beer. The only knock for me is the price limits me to only a couple six packs a year. But on the other hand it is a treat to have and maybe I enjoy each one that much more, because I'm not buying a case. This is a beer I don't save, the fresher the better.

Any rate I lucked out and got what appears to be the last 6 pack available on 2/5/14 at a small package store outside the burbs. Score! Amazing beer and insanely overpriced and of corse overhyped but a great beer nonetheless. The honey profile of this years batch seems more subdued than prior years.

1160,"2014-02-09",4.2,"Bottled 17 January 2014, drank 09 February 2014. Honey-colored orange, milky and murky. Not much head, and what there is dissipates quickly. Looks like it has low carbonation.

The aroma is quasi-barleywine status. Sweetly malted, with honey and dark sugars. There is a cotton candy, bubblegum aroma. The perfume of hops are there, of course, but they are balanced with a candy aroma Ive not quite experienced before.

The flavor at the outset is wood: oak and pine both. The malt sweetness is a welcome balance, prevents it from being an overly bitter hop-bomb.

Smooth feel with a bit of prickly-ness. This beer is definitely closer to a barleywine (or a 120 Minute IPA) than it is to a regular imperial IPA. The heavy oak, balanced with the pink-sugared sweetness lends it a lot of unique flavors.

S: A cornucopia of juicy tropical fruits, natural honey, accented by spices and medium toast malts. Cant stop sniffing this. 

T/M: Follows the nose with juicy fruits, honey dew melon, cantaloupe, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, tropical bubblicious, timid fresh pine needles and earthy honey drizzled granola. I get hints of corn alcohol, toasted grain and lightly smoldered pine wood. Hops are pronounced and assertive but not overly bitter. Booze is a tad harsh and warms the senses. Medium- full bodied that is sticky and gracefully carbonated. Lingers pomegranate, berries and honey. Leaves a drying film on the palate similar to sharp cheddar cheese. 

O: I just love highly hopped brews that dont smack you with harsh bitterness but truly highlight and display the lush flavor of the hops. This is a masterpiece of complexity and harmony. This beer mimics me of a tropical fruit Naked juice but with alcohol. Only down side is availability and the price.

At first its tangerine, then a bit of grapefruit, some pine. but then the floral overcomes anything you can name and these hops become pure perfumed lightness. The malt is a breaddy scent with a bit of earthy honey. Orange blossoms. No alcohol on the nose. Taste is very sweet. The honey is thick or so it seems and the malt is rich. It has a fruitiness form the tangerine and grapefruit but its very dry and so its earthier rather than juicier. The malt becomes like a soft sugar cookie on the nose and on the palate. Its a bit chewy. There is a faint herbal that becomes stronger as you drink. I was waiting for a biting, bitter, tongue bruising like the label said but I found the bitter to be a bit more than moderate. As I am finishing the glass the juiciness is coming forward more and the scent is becoming a bit more tropical.

Poured a peachy orange color with about a finger of white head, lots of carbonation. Smell is balanced, lots of potent hops but with a subtle sweetness as well. Taste is AMAZING!!!!bitter up front and sweet towards the end. Perfect combination. Does a great job of masking alcohol, 10%??? No wonder I was knocked off my ass

Very solid.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"
1160,"2014-01-31",4.3,"Pours a beautiful golden honey color with a slight orange tint to it. Nice one finger off-white head that leaves nice clumps of sticky lacing on the glass. Head retention is decent. Aroma is tangerine, pineapple, citrus peel, honey, and hints of pine resin. Smells wonderful. Flavor is sweet and citrusy, with just enough hops to keep it from being too sweet. Honey and citrus dominate the front end, quickly followed by the hops which remind you what youre drinking. Big hop flavors on the back-end. Leaves a malty, biscuit-like flavor on the palate, which slowly fades away into a more bitter flavor profile as it lingers on the tongue a few minutes later. The alcohol is hidden brilliantly in this one. I would have never guessed this was a 10% ABV brew. I would have guessed in the 7-8% range. You can definitely taste the alcohol a little more as the beer starts to warm up in the glass, but not much. Mouthfeel is thick and luscious. Perfect carbonation. Id say this is about as good as it gets for an IPA. Overall this beer is worthy of the hype it gets. Too bad its so damn hard to get your hands on, but I guess that is part of the allure of these types of beers. IPAs even ore so with their limited shelf life, which decreases their availability.","Georgia, USA","dunn4040"

1160,"2014-01-25",4.5,"Reviewed from notes. Received in trade. She pours a light golden color and leaves the same colored body. A half finger white foamy head appears and lasts for about a half minute. Light sticky foamy lacing appears. The smell has a ton of piney hops (holy hops, Batman! - could there be any more in the smell?), citrus, and some light honey (more so as the beer warms). Light caramel and a slight malty presence comes in later in the beer. The taste has a large amount of bitter and sweet between the previously mentioned flavors. A bit of spiciness comes through as the beer warms. On the palate, she sits about a medium with nothing sharp on the tongue. This has got to be one of the smoothest DIPAs Ive ever had. The 10 % ABV is hidden very well, as I almost feel like I could pound this all day, very sessionable. The aftertaste is piney and the finish is sticky and bitter.

1160,"2014-01-21",4.2,"On tap into a tulip.

Its a slightly hazy, orange-gold beer with a very light foamy head that leaves an average lacing along the inside of the glass. The taste is medium-heavy bitter with maybe some light citrus sweet, but the bitter definitely dominates (would you ever guess that from the name?). Its a medium-full body beer with a pleasant amount of carbonation. Even though the malt doesnt readily present itself in the nose, or even in the tongue for that matter, it subtly presents in the fact that this beer is very smooth drinking for such a hop forward recipe. Its beautifully balanced and leaves a mild hop and floral aftertaste thats surprising clean - it doesnt linger very long and, while it is present, doesnt feel like it coating my mouth.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Poured into a pint glass at around 43 degrees, I SO looked forward to the 2014 Hopslam remembering last years LAYERS of flavors. Bummer, Im not getting that this year. Okay, so perhaps my taste buds have changed or I have a memory lapse. This is still great beer but I had it on my top five list and Ill have to move it to the top ten for now until the 2015 release. Perhaps it was the hop shortage last year that attributed to a different flavor profile. Im still getting grapefruit and citrus and lots of nice hop bitterness with the sweet malt and honey balance, Im just not getting the complexity that I savored in last years batch.

Poured to NB Globe

A: Pours a dull golden ale. Excellent clarity and consistent ribbons rise to feed the central cap on a film of creamy haze. The initial head of maybe one finger falls quickly. Spotty lace clings to the glass.

S: Sour pineapple, cotton candy, sweet peaches, hints of pine and hemp. Some of the sweetness feels like its coming from the alcohol. Lots of different citra play around in there too. A bit too ambitious IMO.

T: Very sweet - due to alcohol I believe. The beer converges on more cotton candy sweet and melds with a healthy (but not enough) amount of good hopped bitterness. The malts here are subdued and do not even reach the hop level here. I understand they call this Hopslam, but I would take SNs Hoptimum any day over this.

M: Medium body and medium carb, the beer allows decent attention to the flavor profile while dispersing the aromatics within the body. Good job here. The ABV numbs just enough to tickle a want for more.

D: For a beer that people are totally nuts for, I think the hype has outdone the quality of the beer. I cant speak for previous vintages, which I hope offer the quality IPA apparently leading to the popularity of the beer. Its the right price point I think, but nonetheless, I think there are much better, more inventive Impy IPAs for the average beer drinker.

1160,"2013-10-07",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2014 Tap: Golden, light-amber body with a moderate amount of haze. A two-finger, creamy, light-beige head sits quietly on top. The aroma is insane; enormous grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest... a huge fruit explosion from the hops, along with resinous pines, leaves, and hop oils flirting with the edge of dank. The malt body isnt anywhere to be found in the aroma. Taste is, again, insane hoppage. Pines, lupulin oils, resinous and slightly dank hop leaves with mild perfume. Pineapple, grapefruit peel, orange flesh. A tropical & citric hop palate pillage. Malt is noticeable, a little. Toasty and lightly sweet... just on the edge of caramel.

Appearance: Im just not used to seeing such a high ABV beer have such a sexy head and with such beautiful lacing. The beer APPEARS filtered, and has a perfectly clear amber/gold color.

Smell: Absolutely stunning. Super grapefruitty from the hops, but then theres plenty of honey sweetness... smells like candy.

Taste/feel: The taste is just... the scores justified, put it that way. I didnt think beer could taste this good. Its got a super nice bitter bite , but the honey and malts mellow it out. As Ive seen other people say, Hopslam isnt really an appropriate name for this beer, because its actually incredibly balanced ... the honey flavor is utterly outstanding. The mouthfeel is also among the best Ive had in any beer. Extremely smooth, lightly carbonated, and just a delight. Im assuming the smoothness in this can be contributed to the honey that the beers brewed with. Holy God is it great... Id also have no idea that this was 10%, as it drinks like a 7%.

1160,"2013-03-18",3.8,"Uploading old ratings that were missing comments. Really good balance of citrus and pine in the hops. Didn't get the cattiness a lot of other people taste. That said, don't quite get the fuss. Feel like this must have been better in earlier batches before my time.

1160,"2013-03-11",4.1,"Appearance: bright orange pour with two fingers of off-white head and good swathes of lace.   Aroma: explosion of floral and citrus hops, with grapefruit being most prominent, along with a hint of honey and spice.   Taste: fruity and surprisingly sweet, with a burst of citrus and floral hops and a restrained wheat toast malt backbone.   Finish: nicely dry but not overly bitter, with lingering grapefruit and flowery flavors.  Notes: Wow.  I hate IPAs in general, but was coaxed to try this and Im so glad I did.  Expected the hops to kill my palate, but these hops werent there just for the sake of being bitter.  In fact, the bitterness was really restrained, in favor of the aroma and flavors these hops brought to the beer.  This brew was actually on the sweeter side, and the honey kept the palate dry and relatively light.  Also, youd never in a million years know this was 10% abv.  What a beer.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

I was never a big IPA fan but this beer completely changed that. Went out and bought another two six packs. This might be the best beer I've had out of a bottle

Its expensive because it is perfected. Aroma is huge american hops, grapefruit but not the typical cascade, more refined with lemon and tropical fruit. Taste is huge hops but somehow balanced. The IBUs dont kick your butt like GD Hercules or of course Ruination, but they somehow fit 10% in here. How the hell that works is beyond me. A lot of honey beers have a dry finish, I homebrewed the white house ale and that was one of my complaints, not here. Finishes clean with hops on the tongue.

1160,"2013-02-20",4.6,"Draft in a snifter.  Pours a clear, deep gold that appears almost syrupy, with very little head.  Aromas of grapefruit and, as was no surprise, honey.  Simply put, Hopslam smells heavenly.  Full bodied and sticky in the mouthfeel, the initial taste is citrus with a distinctive hop bitterness, but it quickly fades to pleasant sweetness.  The high alcohol content is masked by the other flavors, so I can see how easy it would be to drink two or three before the slam hits!  Its a perfect example of why its important to know what youre getting into before you start!  Overall, Hopslam is a surprisingly balanced DIPAone which doesnt rely on an over-the-top bombardment of hops but secures its remarkability through a perfect, palate-pleasing amalgam of all components.   This beer lives up to its reputation.","","mcrae19"

The D/IPA poured a clear amber color, small steady off-white head with some lacing.   The ipressive thing about Hopslam is the  aroma of passion fruit, and pine.   The honey does strange things to the massive hopping.  It mellows the bitterness and improves the overall experience.  The high ABV again is very deceptive. the carbonation was average.

First taste, the silky nature of the beer is noticed as it washes down.  Hop flavors arrive in rapid succession: citrus, pine, and floral notes.  Malt backbone is slightly sweet, and the flavor notes of spent honey give a false impression of honey sweetness that perfectly balances out the hop aftertaste.

1160,"2013-02-09",4.7,"Aroma: citrus hops, slight honey mixed with body odor. Appearance: pours a clean golden color with a glorious white, fluffy head that does not leave willingly. Great lacing left by the head that will not go away. Taste: spicy and citrusy at the same time. Some honey notes are there as well, chased by alcohol. Palate: hops and more hops up front that end with bitter hops and more bitter hops at the end. The finish is rather sweet as well. Overall: from the first smell of hops and armpits (not a bad thing for beer) to the bitter sweet finish (as in bitter from hops and sweet from honey) this beer is almost unbeatable. Must try. You wont be disappointed.","Portland, Michigan, USA","BrownALEx"

1160,"2013-02-04",3.7,"Aroma has quite a bit of citrus but also a bit of a floral note from the hops. There is also a supporting malt character with cracker and light caramel. Behind these notes I pick up a surprising amount of diacetyl - artificial butter and butterscotch for sure. Some pine resin and alcohol also in the aroma. 
Pours a slightly cloudy gold with hints of copper. A thick, slightly off-white head that recedes slowly but steadily leaving moderately high lacing. Medium sized legs. 
Starts with sweet cracker and light caramel malts. Some bright citrus hop character with a slight resin note in the background. The bitterness is moderately high but not astringent at all. The alcohol is well hidden and is barely perceptible in the finish. The diacetyl is light but noticeable in the flavor as well. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Astringency is very low and alcohol warmth is moderate. 
In some ways this beer is better than I remembered but in other ways worse. The hop character is fruity and the malt character is lighter than I remember (both positives). The diacetyl is more noticeable than I remember (definitely a negative). The alcohol in this beer is very well hidden.

Overall this is damn close to the perfect beer. I about got a nut when I was actually able to find it (having moved from Michigan to South Carolina...) and even closer to getting a nut after tasting it again. The balance is unique and expertly crafted. It brings a great honey sweetness that no other IPA has done before (that Ive had anyway).

1160,"2013-02-02",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2015 Update:  Wasnt too keen on the first couple bottles of this 6 pack, but now that its a month old it really tastes better.  Pours a clear orange gold with head that thins out but leaves great lacing.  Aroma is rich and soft with citrus and floral hops, with some alcohol in the mix.  Taste is a wrestling match between the dollop of honey and dry, alcoholic hop bitterness.  With the weight its throwing around, you almost expect to get slammed in the finish, but the balance is strong, everything mellows out in the long finish, and going for another sip is easy.  Very drinkable.   Some alcohol in the nose, but its not heavy handed.  Im coming back around on this one.

1160,"2013-01-31",4.7,"Have had this a few times in past years but never got around to reviewing this. Bad oversight, as this is a GREAT DIPA. Pours a cloudy orange with plenty of carbonation evident and a two-finger head that gradually gives way to a foamy coating. Lacing is perfect evidence of each sip. Nose is overwhelming citrus (especially orange, grapefruit and lemon), but hints of honey are there as promised. Taste: The one disagreement I would have with Stone is that his is NOT a ""biting, bitter, tongue buster,"" although elements of each descriptor are there. I find it actually much better balanced than that, the honey backbone probably doing the most to sorta tame these very wonderful hops. Taste is at first dominated by the citrus but this is so beautifully balanced by the honey and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium, and aftertaste is a sweet bitterness that is not overly cloying. Certainly, there is enough bitterness and dryness to satisfy DIPA fans but this is a VERY refreshing and crisp end to a very special beer. Come on, cant SOMEONE do this ALL YEAR?

1160,"2013-01-25",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2013 Hazy golden yellow with half a finger of white head with good lacing.  Dank aroma with grapefruit citrus and some of that ammonia cat piss smell.  Can taste the honey and malt sweetness first then grapefruit and some piney hop flavor.  Mild bitterness follows and youre left with a nice balanced aftertaste.   Full mouthfeel that is also sticky with a moderate carbonation.  I was surprised how balanced  and drinkable this was.  Very nice double IPA.

The body is very thin and the carbonation is a little too high for me with a long bitter finish.

1160,"2013-01-15",5.0,"AROMA:
This beer presents with a delicate citrus approach. Then you get closer and it turns from tangerine to grapefruit. then you pull back. Give it a swirl and navel orange comes out with some vanilla and you get a frozen orangesickle! come back in and dig deep. Pick up the lime and lemon. Back away, and the gentle pick grapefruit stays. Unbelievable.

APPEARANCE:
Pours a shimmery dark orange. Leaves good lace on the glass, and emits a perfect carbonation. Literally, nothing to ding here. Looks great with and inner glow and the smell wafts to the nose.

TASTE:
Begins on the tongue with complex hoppiness. There is just the faintest hint of Belgian malt, then it begins its finish and encore. This is unbelievable. It brings every citrus fruit to the party, along with white chocolate, allspice, nutmeg, oak, and then starts a long denouement. The hops cling and linger. I have to wonder how they did this with a beer.

PALATE:
Complexity isnt the right word. It is like Simplicity, but sequenced. It goes from simple this to simple that, like 6 times with every sip. It takes you to fruit heaven, to bier-gardens and leaves you refreshed. Somehow, Bells managed to hide and ABV 10 in this unbelievable triumph.

OVERALL:
I have never been compelled to rate anything as 100% or perfect. I resist typing the words, but this years Hopslam  has earned it from me. Admittedly, I am a hophead so I might be a little biased, but IMHO, this beer is literally perfect. Nice work. If you can get it, buy it. If you can afford to, buy enough to get you to summer. This beer is best fresh, but will age with gusto.","Naperville, Alabama, USA","HoppiLee"

1160,"2012-11-27",4.6,"Bottle date of 1/25/12, so nearly 5 months on this one. Poured into pint glass.

A - A half finger of fine white head forms. Body is deep honey and amber. Cloudy. Not sure if its chill haze or the natural appearance of the beer. Retention is decent. Minimal lacing.

S - Citrus bomb. Tons of lemon and orange peel. Some sharper resiny and grapefruit notes as well. Grassy, slightly bready, and hints of tropical fruit.

T - Malt is noticeable up front. Caramely and sweet. I also get some mango, lemongrass and pine flavor toward the front. Slightly more tangy, spicy and bitter toward the middle. Bitterness really takes hold on the sides and back of the tongue, but doesnt destroy my palate. Juicy, hoppy, and lemony finish. What I feel sets this DIPA apart, though, is its incredible balance. There is a definite smooth malty backbone that holds its own all the way through the finish.

M - Medium-to-thick body. However, it is most definitely not syrupy and cloying. The finish is quite clean semi dry. Incredibly refreshing for such a big beer. Boozy warmth is just barely noticeable.

1160,"2012-10-09",4.0,"12 oz. bottle served in a Founders snifter. Bottled 12/29/11.

A: Pours a clear amber color with a one inch, pure white head forming on the pour. The retention was very nice and drawn out. It subsided slowly to a thin film and thick collar that left some sudsy and soapy lace.

S: Very nice smells are wafting out of the glass. Notes of citrus and tropical fruits with a subtle pine and dankness as well. There is a slight bready malt and a touch of sweet honey on the backend.

T: The taste really follows the nose. Great citrus fruit notes, mostly grapefruit, come through with a slight bittering hop in the middle. There is a slight floral quality to it as well. The finish is rounded out with a sweet honey. The bready malts take a bake seat to the hops in this one.

M: Light bodied, but surprisingly sticky in nature. The ABV is well hidden in this, very dangerous. The carbonation is great and it has a nice sweet finish that feels very clean and refreshing.

O: Very well balanced and the honey sweetness really adds a nice touch that rounds out the beer. Its a shame this comes out in the winter as I would love to drink this during the warmer months, but it certainly is a treat none the less.

1160,"2012-09-28",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2015 On tap at Savas in Ann Arbor.  Served in pint glass.

Aroma has traces of both the sweet honey and the in-your-face pine citrus hops. Elements of grapefruit and a hint of cat pee (citra?).  Clear amber color, with a small head.  Looks like candy. Beautiful golden orange pour and perfectly clear. Big head and punches tou with the aroma as it pours.

Taste follows the aroma perfectly.  Grapefruit, pine, zesty citrus, and some sweet honey. Nice bitterness up front with a punch of hops going down as well. Lingering honey citrus pine on the palate. Very drinkable, despite the 10% alcohol. Light to medium body with medium carbonation.  A must try for anyone who fancies themselves a hop head.

Despite all the hops added to the boil and the dry-hopping, compared to West Coast IPAs, I would not call this intensely hoppy, perhaps because of its sweetness. I am not a fan of overly-sweet IPAs (Imperial or otherwise) and this one is a little over the line on sweetness for me. I say ""a little"" because it was quite pleasant and I wouldnt turn one down if offered again. Cant say the same about others I find cloyingly sweet.","Tigard, Oregon, USA","Hoptful"

Citrus hops up front, followed by malt sweetness and then rounded off by Bitter, resinous pine toward the end of the sip. The higher ABV is masked magnificently, yet leaving a nice warming sensation as it goes down. Very mild lingering bitterness.

Im getting oranges, flowers and honey for sure.  Somehow smells oily too, like olive oil.  Makes my mouth water.  Very, very smooth taste.  Bitterness seems to hit first but then floral and citrus hops take over.  Love the finish.  So much going on and flavor stays a while.  Im getting a little alcohol burn too.  Next time I will pour into a tulip glass.  I think I will like it even better that way.  Re-rate 5/8/13 - Ive had this numerous times in the last couple months.  Great DIPA but very different from the kind I usually like.  This beer is impressive because of how smooth it is despite being very strong and bitter.  The floral and citrus hops blend smoothly with the honey and malt.  I much prefer to drink this super fresh but is still tasty up to a year later. Re-rate 2/20/15 - Each year I get less excited about Hopslam.  Its still really good but I no longer love it.  Its also better on tap in my opinion. Smells better than it tastes too.

1160,"2012-04-10",5.0,"6 pack purchased in Indianapolis for $18.99.  Bottle Pours less dark than you might expect for an imperial IPA perhaps the honey influences the overall color of the beer nicely.  Aroma is sweet citrus malt with a very faint hint of alcohol.  Body is on the lighter side for an imperial IPA.  Taste is bitter, earthy grass tones, and incredibly hoppy.  The taste of alcohol simply doesnt exisit in this gold medal brew in fact I believe the honey in this beer masks the alcohol taste perfectly.  Beautifully balanced, slammed with hops, and a bitter, then sweet finish make this my favorite imperial IPA Ive ever tasted.

1160,"2012-04-10",4.4,"I was lucky enough to find a bottle of this at Scottsdales phenomenal Papago Brewing. Pours a rich golden amber and supports a thick, creamy dusky tan head with thick curtains of lacing. The aroma is equally split between piney, citrusy hops and sweet, caramely malt. Fresh grapefruit, milk chocolate, pine, toffee and light vanilla hit you in the first flavor wave followed closely by caramel and toasted malt. Honey sweetness pops in and out but never gets in the way of the starring role of hops or upsets the overall balance of the brew.  Silky, full and creamy texture and a long, sweet but still refreshingly bitter finish.  Theres a reason this beer is so highly sought after and tapping frenzies at craft beer bars are justified.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"

1160,"2012-03-16",4.3,"I was happy to find this in the cooler at a local dive bar.  I poured it from the bottle into a pint glass.  Fantastic, bright, sticky aromas of twangy citrus and floral hop zest jump from the glass.  The beer is pleasingly slick in the mouth and possess a very rounded feel with the perfect balance of carbonation.  The honey really seemed to bind the flavors together and smooth this ale out a bit.  On the palate, all the fruity permutations of hop complexity are present, most notably being citrus rind, grapefruit, flowers and melons.  The finish is smooth and really retains the hop punch without getting too bitter.  This is just, simply put, a fantastic beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","bosendorfer"

1160,"2012-03-15",4.7,"Appearance: very clear amber orange with 2 finger foamy off white head. Aroma: just the juiciest citrus and floral hop aroma ever; grapefruit, even some pineapple, and some mild pine/grass notes; picking up very subdued caramel notes. Taste: huge floral hoppiness at the front, touches of the floral honey in the middle, and finishing with sweet caramel, floral hops and smooth bitter piney hop flavors lingering through the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: medium, very creamy body. Overall:  Take the beautiful smell of a rose, turn it into a taste, and its like drinking a rose!  Ive waited until I had my 5th one this year to rate this and my first response to the first was that its like drinking a flower.  This is probably one of the best things Ive ever had to drink.  I know this is strange and dramatic, but it almost doesnt even fit in the beer category...","","scooter520"

1160,"2012-03-14",4.5,"It was hard to track this beauty down, but once I got my hand on a six-pack I was ready to give it a go.

Pours a beautiful deep copperish color and the aroma is my favorite part.  I found myself with my nose buried in the glass several times just taking in the notes of honeysuckle, grapefruit, kiwi, and other floral overtones.  The head is very small and white and disappears very quickly.

The taste followed the scent almost perfectly.  Dry, sweet and crisp hops with very little alcohol on the tongue.  The beer mellows well and more floral flavors seep through as it slightly comes to room temperature.

Overall a delicious beer and worth the effort to find and try.  Its not cheap by any means at $15.99 plus tax for 6.  Bells impresses me with their line-up every year and season.  I havent had a bad brew yet from them.","Illinois, USA","jason1970"

1160,"2012-03-09",4.3,"Style et résumé: Double IPA haut de gamme brassée avec du miel. 
Comment: Bouteille de 355ml. Merci Patrick. 
Description: Superbe bière dorée avec une légère couche de mousse blanche. Le nez est singulier, on se croirait dans la forêt boréale ou la pinède dOka tellement cette bière sent les conifères. Il y a aussi une touche dagrumes mais en aucun cas cette bière sent le caramel, aucun abus ici des malts de spécialités et cest tant mieux.  La bouche est ronde, la texture parfaite pour ce type de bière. Il y a du miel et du sapin. Le caramel est absent ou très discret. Un classique.

1160,"2012-03-08",4.4,"I have heard a lot of great things about this beer for the last month or so, and I recently was able to pick up a six pack and try it out for myself.

Bells is always consistent, and with Hopslam they have created one of the best IPAs in America, in my opinion. Im not even that big of a fan of India Pale Ales, but the balance of honey and hops makes this one fly!

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it provides a color that is somewhere between golden and amber, coming across as pure honey just from its look. I was expecting to be blown away from the bitterness, but thats really not the case with this double IPA. There is a lot to be said about this beers smoothness. Its incredible, and has opened my optimism for IPAs up again.

It has the perfect blend of hops and a wonderful aroma. The honey seems to balance the heavy alcohol taste that I usually get from imperial or double IPAs which I really like.

Pours a hazy dark gold with a one finger head. Poor head retention but moderate lacing.

Smells very citrusy with lots of pineapple; almost like fruit juice. Some floral notes are there as well.

The citrus hops come through very prominently at first and linger throughout. A moderate to high bitterness appears about halfway through and lingers for awhile. Honey is detectable mainly towards the finish and the sweetness hides any alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to full but not at all syrupy like many IIPAs.

Pours a peachy orange color with about a finger of white head, lots of carbonation. Smell is balanced, lots of potent hops but with a subtle sweetness as well. Taste is bitter up front and sweet towards the end. Does a great job of masking alcohol, and the honey really balances it. Hop profile is a great mix of floral and citrus. The right amount of bitter.

A: Honey/Amber/Orange color. Very hazy. Small head, with lots of tiny bubbles and a few large bubbles mixed in, after a pretty aggressive pour into pint glass. Head quickly got even smaller (probably due to alcohol content), but didnt completely vanish.

T: There is a low amount of honey sweetness, but the hop bitterness wins out from the start and even more so in the finish which lingers Hop flavor is more grassy than the aroma. Difficult to detect any malt character, sweetness comes mostly from the honey. 

M: Medium-low carbonation level.There is a little bit of warming sensation at the end when the honey fades, but not hot.

Nice taste with caramel malts and honey, but the palate does suffer from the massive hop bitterness.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","TheGB"

1160,"2012-02-25",3.8,"Bottle, 1/22/12 from bobbypaulson. Amber with an off white / biege thin head. Nice soapy, light citrus and some resin that combine into a wonderful hop profile, slight undercurrent of alcohol /nail polish but this pretty much faded once the beer had a chance to warm up more, malts also come a little more to the forefront. Smooth, slightly bitter at first, moderate carbonation and body, does not become overwhelmingly bitter which is nice although it grows nicely with a hint of sweetness to balance things out. Nice clean taste on the palate at the end, somewhat bitter, very drinkable.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"

1160,"2012-02-23",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/15/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. 

Hopslam has a tangerine color with a creamy white head, decent retention, and nice lacing.

At first sniff it seems scathingly bitter. A honey reduction, tons of orange and grapefruit, and some tropical fruit, mostly pineapple to boot. Screw balance, the hops are in charge.

Softly sweet malt backbone tries to hold up to the hop assault. A honey reduction adds some character. Tons of grapefruit, pineapple, and orange blossoms. Great hop explosion. Absolutely awesome. 

I have no idea how they make this finish so clean. No hop residue, the carbonation cleans out any hop oil that was on the tongue. Cleaner and a little bit less grainy than on tap, I believe.

Love me some Hopslam. This is great fresh, tap or bottle. 10% ABV nowhere to be found.

On tap at the Eccentric Cafe 8/23/2010.

Hopslam pours a dark tangerine color with a solid white head. Good level retention and some nice lace stick. A bit hazy and unassuming considering how much of a hopped up, high ABV DIPA this is.

Such an elegant blend of hoppy goodness. Juicy grapefruit and pineapple, with orange and a bit of honey in the background. 

This is truly what I have been looking for in a double IPA since I was introduced to the style. It is tough for me to tell when the honey really impacts the flavor, but there is a distinct pale malt sweetness at the beginning of the sip. This malt really frames the hop profile well. Juicy pineapple and grapefruit, along with some other smoothly blended citrusy fruits. Such a fantastic hop profile. Finishes clean and smooth. 

It would be hard to hide the grainy hop feel and oil, but this is tied together so well. A nice creamy feel, with a fuller than medium body. Finishes clean, with just a touch of hop residue, and it leaves me longing for the next sip. 

Having this on tap was absolutely mind blowing. The difference between having a fresh batch is remarkable. It is so difficult to enunciate the nuances that really push this beer over the top.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
1160,"2012-02-22",4.1,"Great piney, sweet aroma. A sharp initial taste that smooths out into a sweet, light lingering feel. The hints of honey are nice, but the citrus and pine throw it off balance for me. Overall, good beer.

1160,"2012-02-22",5.0,"aroma-  citrus, citrus, citrus, seriously thats all im getting here, it smells so frickin good!  probably the best smelling ipa ever and im sure most would agree.

appearance-  color is a golden orange, one of the best looking ipas I have ever laid eyes on.  pretty clear, and a good amound of carbonation going on,  head looks to be a half a finger and a tanish white color

taste-  at first I found it to be pretty heavy tasting, after sitting on the bottle for about a month I find it has simmered down a little and is much more enjoyable, I think im gonna start giving the bottle about a month now before I crack one open.  taste like pure tropical fruits.  pretty bitter although not as much as you would think considering the name.

palate-  full body, creamy, sticky, lively, bitter, long finish, 

overall-  probably the best double ipa ever, although it really is considered a honey ale, whatever that means lol.  yes it does have a bit of honey flavor in it but for the most part I get nothing but fruits and hop flavors in it.  great job bells you own this beer!","jenison, USA","founder26"

1160,"2012-02-21",4.9,"This beer has been on my radar for about a year.  I happened across this and the local beer store guy slipped me a six pack from his secret refrigerated stash.  I was pretty pumped, even after about $18/six.  
So here is my review,
Aroma: Amazing, literally has a sphere of aroma around the glass, fragrant, citrus.  Give it some time to breath and swirl. Wonderful! I found myself enjoying the fragrance for some time.
Appearance: Perfect deep orangihs, golden honey. Some alcohol legs, but its 10% right!?
Taste: This is the IPA or DIPA, Imperial IPA lovers dream!  The best beer Ive had.  And I know that there are 1000s I havent had yet.  That said.  Beautifully balancec, fruity, citrus, crushed citrus fruit, mango, pineapple, with a sweet sense of honey, very mild at the end of the taste.  Experience this beer, I would say with no food. (I scored a 9/10 on taste for the slight alcohol bite, not used to that, but again its a 10% beer).
Palate: Again, the balancing of the hop bite with the the citrus sweet somewhat fizzes on your tongue,...slight chew, but mild and refreshing.
Overall:  I will be a purchaser of this each season it arrives.  I bought a six pack this year.  But If I could discipline myself to only 1-2 of these Id buy a case.  Well worth it.  NEXT ON MY LIST... OF COURSE PLINY THE ELDER!","Oklahoma, USA","Gottsacker"

Taste is full of citrusy goodness, with the alcohol hidden completely.  Will have to re-rate when I open one of the bottles I got to go, since the aroma will likely be stronger than from the tap.  Edit: just opened a bottle of this.  Smells better out of the bottle, but tastes better on tap.  You cant win them all.

1160,"2012-02-20",3.4,"Spitting in a blast furnace, thats what this rating is.  Ive never been easily seduced by ham-handed west coast dry hopping -- its such a clumsy mechanism to get a round of applause.  The conventional wisdom is High ABV and/or High IBU = Good Beer... its the beer equivalent of a crotch shot.   That said, I was warned.  The beer *is* named ""Hopslam"" and there is a picture of a lilliputian fellow crushed under a hop cone like last nights stogie ... but I digress.  I tried a dram of this on tap at Momos the other day, but PorterPounder and I came to the conclusion that it was an insufficient sample -- so I had to buy a bottle. The aroma is all vegetable hops, fresh pineapple and freshly-peeled grapefruit.  OK label, hazy orange-gold brew.  Citrus pith, tongue-curling bitterness, when warm it gave me an impression of brininess. Moderately sweet, but the ABV comes unmasked.  Medium-heavy body, kat whizz in the finish -- leaves me feeling like I dug too far down in the breakfast grapefruit.   Market Square Liquors, Bradfordville.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"

Aroma is what youd expect - hops and citrus.

1160,"2012-02-14",4.2,"Draft at M. Moggers pub in Terre Haute, Indiana while on a business trip.  Pours a clear honey amber hue with one finger of creamy white-ish foam.  Aroma is not particularly strong but has a wide variety of different hop notes: green/dank hops, underripe grapefruit, some sweet tropical fruits, and grass/flowers in the spring.  Taste has lots of complex hop-inspired flavors: tropical fruit (creamy mangosteen, rambutan/lychee), strawberries, some grapefruit/citrus.  A honey-caramel maltiness provides a certain balancing sweetness, but this is not very bitter despite the big hop profile.  Full bodied with a mild lingering earthy bitterness.  The high ABV is very well concealed.  There is lots of complexity here (not so common in DIPAs), and I really like the tropical fruit notes in this.  Would like see more breweries maybe add some honey to the heavily hopped beers...it certainly seems to work here.  Glad I finally got to try this, and great that it was on draft.

Typical west coast IIPA on the nose - big on the citrus and mango, backed up with some pine and subtle malt support, more boozy than some.

Massive aromatic hops up front in the nose, giving a wonderful citrus, floral and earthy profile. Notes of caramel and honeysuckle round out the aroma. The flavor is strong, but very well balanced. The bitterness is forward, but pleasant, and the honey and malts balance it out perfectly. Relatively light body, a little prickly, but not too lively. The aftertaste is smooth and mellow. Overall, this is an amazingly built IIPA, with perfect balance and amazing flavor, and dangerously drinkable. Im looking forward to the rest of the 6-pack.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

1160,"2012-02-08",4.1,"Great aroma of citrus.  Mild flavor for a DIPA which I think is from the honey that really tones down the hops.  Very little bitterness which helps the after taste.

January 25, 2014 - bottle from AV3.  Moved the appearance up to a 4 as the head and lacing were very nice.  Dropped taste from 9 to an 8 as just a bit too much pine.  Total rating stayed same at 4.1.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"

Very thin and sparse tiny bubble lacing, light carbonation, medium/thick body, resinous texture, and grapefruit with a hint of pine aroma.  Taste is fairly large complex floral grapefruit up front, some pine, some alcohol, a hint of honey, and lighter bitter finish.  Overall this is not one of my favorite styles, is slightly better as it warms, this one does not cover the alcohol (I know the abv is 10%, but still), but I would rather have 3F Dreadnaught or New Glarus IIPA for the style.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
1160,"2012-02-05",4.1,"Local Option, Chicago tap ($7): Pours a golden color with a white head. Aroma is of floral hops, floral hops, floral hops, and a little bit of sugar. Taste is complex hoppiness, which culminates a sweet finish (not too sweet). Alcohol covered adeptly. Hops mixed impressively. Aromas pour out decisively. This beer is quite hoppy, and it is, as such, a sipper. I couldnt really chug this as I could some other beers. In any case, I suppose it lives up to the hype.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

1160,"2012-02-03",4.4,"12 oz bottle.  Yes, this beer lives up to its rating, at least when it is as fresh (bottled just 23 days ago) as this beer is.  The most amazing aspect of this beer is the aroma that hits you when you pop open the top.  Pours a light amber color with a quickly ending head. The honey does an excellent job of taking the edge off of the hops, without any sort of cloying sweetness whatsoever. The floral notes on this beer are unbelievable.  On a couple sips the high alcohol lurking in the background was discernible, but for the most part the 10% is well hidden. I actually wish the ABV was lower so I could  have another.....","Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA","johnbuck100"

Again, a remarkably drinkable beer.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","winejab"

Pours golden orange, skinny, white head that doesnt last long, but leaves a nice lace.  First sip is much sweeter than anticipated, and a bit dense on the palate, but is quickly balanced by hop bitters. As some have already stated, it could possibly be considered a bit syrupy, but I think its mild & I dont mind. Carbonation is full of tiny bubbles, added with the ABV leaves a little bite on the tongue. Its not quite as complex as it could be, abut its done absolutely fantastically.

The appearance was a crystal clear dark orange with a white head, half inch, that settled slowly into a white ring and thick lacing. The medium bodied palate finished mildly sticky, and taste was like eating a handful of flowers. Exactly as advertised. Bitter, floral hop that bites with only the faintest hint of honey before a blast of bitter hop aftertaste. Delicious.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","PGHbeer77"

Lovely fresh fruit! Taste has sweet fresh fruit, bitter citrus and some solid caramel malt. Syrupy mix of bitter and sweet with a terrific flavor. I had remembered this as more honey-d and more one-dimensionally hoppy, however this was very balanced with a lot of hop presence. Alcohol only a vague presence.

Hops burst out on the front and are fairly bitter and quite crisp, fading away on the backside and letting a big, rich malt come to life. Honey and fruit are strong but not overwhelming and a light breadiness fills in on the swallow. Finish is long, smooth, and just a touch bitter.

Its pretty smooth for a 10% beer with good dryness and not barleywine carmelly sweet. Has an overall orange like taste.I see more of the honey taste this year than last year.

The aroma has plenty of hop and malt character.  On the malt side, you get plenty of the honey, and a nice sweetness.  The hops bring a ton of grapefruit, floral notes, and even a bit of passionfruit.  The taste has a huge hop bite, followed by a delicious honey, and fruity backbone.  This has a long lingering bitterness that doesnt dry the tongue too much.  Incredible palate for a DIPA that is full but not cloying at all.

ABC Outta Focus, River Horse Hop-a-lot-amus, and Stone Ruination.  Taste consists of citrus, namely orange and grapefruit, honey (slight),  and flowers, or how I imagine a flower would taste.

Nose is a pungent hop bouquet of grapefruit, pine resin, flowers, perhaps a touch of tangerine, and a dab of honey and sweet grain. Taste is quite bitter, though not overwhelming, with a subtle balancing sweetness and almost the illusion of a tart fruit note. Medium bodied, juicy with hop goodness, oily, slick, fairly active carb, with a long fruity yet bitter finish. How a beer can be this big and so refreshing and easy to drink is why it is so popular.

Crisp golden and honey coloured body with a nice, dense four centimetre tall off-white head. Nice rich bitter and assertively hoppy flavours throughout, that are balanced by the honey and sweetness, and the 10% abv somehow passes by relatively well. Aftertaste still shows the bitterness and the alcohol. Overall, a nice Imperial IPA still, but even having this as a home state beer, it is overrated in so many ways. Nice to try again, and I have a ton of bottles/cans of this around aging at various stages, but sampling this fresh, still makes it good, but not worth going crazy for.

Aftertaste has a good dose of pineapple, a lot of sweetness and obviously quite a bit of hops - the alcohol is pretty noticeable on the tail end too. Overall, a nice Imperial IPA with the flavour switched more to the honey and sweetness than just the hops with a good balance, albeit the strong alcohol shows through at the end - good that this is a twelve ounce bottle though!

Dark orange gold color that is mildly opaque.  Awesome massive hop aroma with sweet sugary citrus and pine.  I need a car air freshener that smells like this.  The taste is of citrus and light sweetness that is very very drinkable for the ABV.  There is no real alcohol taste due to the honey sweetness that helps cut the bitterness as well.

Bottles, wonderful golden hue with white two finger head, AMAZING aroma, of fruits, grapefruit in particular, honey, and hops. As soon as you open the bottle, the entire area around you suddenly smells wonderful! The taste is just like they describe: It bashes the front of your tongue, with hop-bitterness, lots of tropical fruits, slight honey, but the 10% ABV leaves almost NO alcohol taste, hence a super-smooth finish, with zero ""hop-buildup"". This beer is just wonderful!!","Alexandria, Alabama, USA","nathanh5"
1160,"2011-05-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2014 12oz bottle at Broneys in Athens, OH (from the bottle, they didnt do the courtesy of pouring in the cup so appearance can only be judged as 3/5). Huge hops taste, but suprisingly not as bitter as I expected. I let my friend taste though, she found it bitter. The hops taste was so pronounced that I think I detected a bacon aroma, which can only be another plus. Less bitter than I expected honestly, maybe because I am a hophead. 10% ABV was a big surprise, this did not taste like an Imperial IPA at all, just like a regular IPA with a greatly enhanced aroma. This is truly hops at its best. The aftertaste is a joy, it buzzes against my palate as I wait for long periods to take the next sip. I sat down to a really chatty girl at the bar, and the long and pleasurable aftertaste on this beer made time fly. I wish I could have had 3 more of these. 9 / 3 / 10 / 5 / 19Re-rate, 1/15/13: 12oz bottle, this time poured into a snifter. Bottled 1/3/13. Half hazy amber / orange color, good thin white head. Good lace. Good smooth lighter carbonation. More dry finish (no stickiness). Bigger body. As far as DIPAs go, this one is definitely more sweet than bitter, though still a good bitterness. A nice balance, really. Delicious big hop profile: grapefruit, orange citrus, some pine. Noticing the honey a lot more this time around, whats really probably most impressive to me about hop slam is that solid silky malt balance to the slam of hops. Yeah, I was skeptical going in.. Will this really stand the test of time, 2000 beers later? But at the last drop, once again, I was left wishing I had more. Delicious stuff. That balance makes it deceptively easy to drink. Somehow manages in to sneak in the huge quantities of hop like a trojan horse. The sessionable hop bomb. I wonder how many of these I could drink in a row without getting burnt out? An experiment to consider for a future release.. 8 / 4 / 9 / 5 / 18 Re-rate, 1/22/14:  Alright, so a lot has changed for me in the last year... After trying maybe 1000 more IPAs, I find myself not so fanatical about them as I once was, and my frame of reference is much wider now. Maybe its that, maybe HopSlam isnt what it once was, and/or maybe the incessant wave of casual beer geeks going nuts about Hopslam / Zombie Dust has turned me off of these super-hyped beers. Despite all that, though, I figured I ought to at least try it, for science. 12oz bottle split with Joe W, bottled 1/11/14. Hazy orange golden color, bit darker. Thin off-white head, leaves good dots and ropes of lace. Bigger body. Lightly slick. Super smooth carbonation. More dry finish. Aroma is less hoppy than I expected. Still some good resiny hop, light pine, grapefruit, and nice light honey note, but a lot of caramel malt too -- a lot more than Sixpoints Hi-Res, which Ive been currently very excited about. Good moderate to bigger bitter taste, light to moderate sweet, light alcohol heat. Still a very solid, tasty DIPA, but the level of hype on this is just absurd. ""Hypeslam"", as Joe muttered. Noticing the sweetness and bigger body much more this time around. Very good, but not the end-all be-all IPA that people make it out to be. 8/4/8/5/16","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

I missed out on this when miketd opened a bottle at ZBF 2008 and it has been one of my most wanted beers ever since.  Drunk to celebrate Manchester United reaching the European Cup Final 2011.  Orange gold colour with slight haze and thin lasting white head.  Big huge hop aroma with lychee and stunning yellow grapefruit.  Some sweetness on the aroma.  Some sweet pink grapefruit as well.  Touch of honey toffee.  And a touch of hot pepper.  Lovely aroma.  Its even better in the mouth with a touch of biscuit as well.  Unbelievably smooth in the mouth thanks to the honey I guess.  Not overly bitter on finish more sweet grapefruit honey and toffee.  No real alcohol heat just a touch of burn on the finish.

1160,"2011-05-03",4.6,"Im no expert, but I drink a lot of IPAs and they are my favorite. Ive never tried the Russian River IPAs though, which I understand are excellent. 

That said, Bells Hopslam is hands down the best beer I have ever had. Ive had other IPAs that were similar in price, that were just ""good"" (in my opinion), so I was a little skeptical at the $17 per 6 pack price and thought ""Ok, Ill try it"".

Needless to say, my beer spending went up for a while as a result (I say a while, since Hopslam is seasonal). Hopslam is worth the price. If your local beer store sells by the bottle, and when Hopslam is available, I highly recommend trying it. 

Due to the high alcohol content and the great taste and smell, its the first beer Ive really sipped, or drank more like a wine. Usually I drink it out of some glasses I have that are more like a brandy snifter. You dont chug this beer, you actually savor it, if you ask me.

The only other beer Ive had that I actually raved about (although Ive only had it once) was Poppaskull, which Im not sure is an IPA. Just throwing that out there for reference.","","giga1"

Lots of hops back this up and make the beer surprisingly refreshing and drinkable at 10%. WOW.  Piney notes tingle the back of my throat Moderate bitter finish. This is no West Coast IIPA for sure.

Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Beer is dark yellow and hazy (maybe from sediment), carbonation moderate and a moderate white head of small and medium bubbles forms, lots of lacing on the glass.

Aroma is mostly malt with a secondary aroma of some hops. It smells sweet, overall good.

This beer is still quite the hop bomb. Full bodied, great hop flavor in the midpalate, a slight aftertaste. There is a nice malt flavor in the front of the mouth. Second taste, rather cleansing. I really am enjoying this beer. The aftertaste grows as you drink, does not really affect drinkability. Both drinkability and mouthfeel high.

Smooth malty sweetness up front with good body; citrus, acidic into bold bitter hops.  And then that smell!  In case you were wondering, Hopslam is delish!!","Andover, Minnesota, USA","mbpufall"

It pops open and immediately fresh hop nectar travels into your nostils. It pours a golden orangeish yellowish amberish color, there is swirling carbonation bubbles, that are quite unique and wonderful. THe head is nice and big and white.

This is the freshest IPA I have smelt aside from my homebrew and it is AMAZING. It is everything you want hops to be, majorly citusy, slightly piney, and slightly sugary.

The taste is godlike hop nectar. Literally plain and simple, there isnt much more to say.

The mouthfeel is PERFECT for this style, the carbonation and body are just right. The drinkablity is through the roof ,I have the compulsion to finish this whole case in a night it goes down so easy (not).

This beer is pretty mythic, the best DIPA i have had and I have had week old Pliny. It is all about the freshness though I have had Hopslam after 6 months and it dies wholly. When it is fresh it is hard to beat. World class.

1160,"2011-02-21",3.9,"Bottle with great thanks to Daknole! This rating is for Batch 10127 (packaged on 1/11/11). Pours a bright, slightly clear copper with light eggshell head. A slightly eggshell ring of lacing remains on the outside of the glass. The aroma is immediately tropical: notes of passion fruit, orange peel, strawberry, pineapple. Its supported by a healthy backbone of honey and hops (maybe amarillo and simcoe?). Really a joy to sniff; I think this replaces Pliny the Elder was my favorite IPA aroma! All that tropical fruit goodness plays second fiddle in the flavor. Slight orange peel and pineapple but heavier on the honey, spruce, and booze. Slight alcohol and resin sting, but the hop rush doesnt really come. Finish is a balance of orange peel and spruce and surprisingly dry. There is soft hoppy bitterness that only slightly lingers but does so for quite a long time. Very good, even if I wasnt blown away.

Taste is equal parts bitter and creamy, you get the rich malts that come out in the DIPA style but the hop level is not as extreme as most others in the style, its just right.  The honey also adds to the creaminess and hides the strong 10% ABV flavor.  This is the best IPA/DIPA out there, its perfect for what it is.

The beer is initially sweet from the caramel but the bitterness creeps up and is notable in the finish.  Just a wonderful hop presence with pine coming on brightd next to the mangoes and grapefruit.  Theres even a complexity of earth and this all kind of hangs together with the caramel malts.  The malts, as they should, hang out in the back and let the hops have the show.  Really wonderful.

1160,"2011-02-14",4.2,"Excited for this one.  Quite expensive.  Clearish golden with a thinned head.  POTENT hop aromas waft off the top and present the nostrils with an initial slam of woodsy bittering hops featuring a flowery citrus, but then they quickly peter out and develop more nuanced cherry brandied aromas and some toasted sugary notes, alcohol.  I envision stumbling across this beer in a wintery meadow just on the verge of springtime.  It is just waiting to burst forth with life and flavor.  I was surprised the glass was not shaking with expectation.  However, the flavors which seemed so promising in their development fell short in follow through.  A robustness was there from the start but never materialized into the promise it gave, although it was  remarkable.  It was still a powerful offering, perhaps needed to sit for a while in the sun to open up,  
Slightly vineoues and sweeteningly strong with its sharpened caramel touch.  Not much honey to taste but it must have been well bouyed by the citrus slam.  Achingly enjoyed.  A very good beer.","Miami, Florida, USA","cbeers21"
1160,"2011-02-14",4.7,"Source: 12 oz bottle from local retailer.

Aroma: Has a rather lovely and potent smell of hops to it. Just based on the first smell I imagine this brew being quite bitter. If there are other smells in here, they arent particularly prominent to my noseits mostly the hops.

Appearance: A light golden color with a little bit of carbonation, accompanied by half a fingers width of light white head. The beer itself is very clear.

Taste: Quite a bit like it smelled like it would taste. The hop flavor is very intense. I was surprised that it was not quite as bitter as I expected it to be. I feel like I taste some lightly bitter citrus fruit on the aftertaste. Very enjoyable taste, overall.

Palate: It has a light body to it, very crisp. Easy to drink quickly. The hops flavor has a bit of staying power. Its the only thing youll be tasting in between sips.

Overall: An exemplary brew. I did not used to be a fan of the style, in general. I now realize this was because I was drinking poor examples of the style. The price I paid for the 6-pack was well worth the cost.","Wisconsin, USA","AbsoluterZero"

Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a thinnish white head that dissipates too quickly. Smells of pine resin and citrus up front. Hints of sweet fruit, grass and honey lie deep underneath the resinous onslaught. Taste is sweeter than the aroma leads you to believe. Theres a solid malt backbone here with a sweet honey taste that drives this brew. Pine, citrus and tropical fruits add to a spicy/herbal taste in the fairy sweet finish. Medium body and carbonation level, sweet less than syrupy mouthfeel. Ive sampled a couple of IPAs tonight and this one is the sweetest.

1160,"2011-02-12",4.5,"Shoutout to my main man Buddha22 for this, got it in a trade with him. Poured a cloudy, semitransparent golden amber, with plenty of foamy, pure white head that laced very well and retained not as well. Left a perfect swirl in the middle of the beer that was gorgeous...that was probably dumb luck, but it was still kind of cool. Aroma was what I was expecting and then some. Started with lots and lots of citrus and tropical fruit, before moving to caramel and brown sugar. Probably the stickiest aroma in a beer Ive ever had the pleasure of smelling. Taste followed suit, with a tropical hop bomb to wake you up. Pineapple and mango dominate, before giving way to that sticky-sweet caramel/brown sugar malt. Honey also rears its head quite slyly right about here. The malt sweetens the fruit flavors and, combined, are dangerously close to becoming candy like - and then the hops save the day, offering up a soft, yet strong, bitterness that perfectly balances the beer. Clean and herbal, the hops finally give in to a slightly sticky finish that leaves you smacking your lips. A tiny bit of booze caps it all off. I like a clean and dry finish as much as the next guy, but this sweet finish is just so good. Drinkability is EXCEPTIONAL for the 10% abv, as you dont even notice it until the end, when it is simply a welcome taste and feeling. This beer balances itself out, and although you may not be able to taste anything else for while, this on its own goes down as easy as just about any beer out there, regardless of style.

Pine sap, herbs, and some malty sweetness all comes together in an aroma that is enticing as anything.  I want to package this scent into a candle. So far this beer has the makings of one of the best.

The flavor is so mouth watering good. Sweet tangy pine weaves its way through a massive hoppy bitterness. Tropical fruits pull together this harmony. The malt backbone is relaxed and lets the hop juice shine. The finish is never ending hops with a bit of earthy grass to it. The body is just right, at 10% ABV its way too drinkable. I planned on just drinking one, but that is like limited a pothead to only one hit. It goes down so smooth with soft carbonation. I feel stupid getting so worked up over a beer, but goddamn is this good.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"
1160,"2011-02-10",5.0,"Overall : delicious. If you like hops, if you like IPA, youll like this. Starting with the bottle design, the experience is excellent.

1160,"2011-02-10",4.2,"Bottle (35 cl) from the Cracked Kettle. Clear deep golden, brief white head. Perfumy and piney hop aroma with tropical fruits, some honey, and a light touch of alcohol.

Citrus, grapefruit, mango, peach, passion fruit with an underlying but solid caramel base. Loads of sweet fruit, honey, caramel, peach, light pine, passion fruit, citrus, grape fruit in the flavour.

1160,"2011-02-09",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2011 Bottle ordered from Cracked Kettle. Hazy yellow with a tiny white head. Very fruity aroma, but a little mild for a DIPA. Light sweetness and medium bitterness. Didnt really deliver the expected in-your-face hoppunch (or hopslam). We were speculating if this may have suffered from bad handling or freezing on its way over here.

Rerate 2/14/2011: So I got the chance to try this again the same week as the original rating, this time with a bottle that a friend bought when he was in Florida so it shouldnt have suffered from bad handling. Indeed it was a little better than the first bottle I tried. Dont know if they were the same batch though.

Pour golden yellow decent white head. Taste honey, malt/mead taste, boozy citrus, grapefruit,caramel,and a great bitterness.

Aroma is big hops, clean and crisp.  Grapefruit leading with some pine scents as well.  Sweet malt scent is present as well.

Taste, like the aroma, is a clean, crisp hop.  Sharply carbonated but the honey lends it a smoothness.  The hops are actually bigger in the taste than they are in the aroma.  Grapefruit and pine.  The honey flavor is subtle but noticeable and the malts are buttered toast. 

Leaves a nicely dry aftertaste.  Excellent double IPA.","Virginia, USA","birderbeerer"
1160,"2011-02-06",4.7,"12 oz bottle. No idea why I havent rated this beer yet. It truly is a gem. This is probably the standard for which all of other dipas should be judged. Pours beautifully with thick, buttery, wispy cream head, sticky lacing, solid retention, and a bright, opaque, golden-burnt orange body. Florals right away in the aroma. More and more hops flow in right afterwards. Nutty citrus fruits, peaches, pears, tropical fruit, and light herbal grass. Then caramels, cereal and pale grains, and minor cookie round out the malt side of things. No booze noticeable at all in either aroma or feel. Theres great hoppy bite to the palate, but without any of it being out of balance. Thick, yet not overly chewy. Flavors compliment the aroma well. Tons of bittersweet fruits in the beginning with mango, pear, apples, melon, and then some heavier mild citrus coming on later. Caramel cookie, toast and pale cereal grains through the middle. A light nutty candy/honey sweetness toward the finish. The finish itself lingers very nicely with herbal grass, light pine, and more mango/pear/citrus. This beer makes me incredibly happy. Fantastic.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"
1160,"2011-02-05",4.3,"Fresh and intense hops.  Golden color with a thin white head.  For all the freshness and hops loaded into this, it is remarkably balanced.  Just the correct amount of bite in the aftertaste.  A true masterpiece.","USA","mjmcend"
1160,"2011-02-05",4.4,"Mostly clear golden color with an impressive layer of bubbly foam head that leaves behind streaky, sticky lacing all around the glass.

Piney nose with some grapefruit and citrus undertones.  Flavor is expectedly hoppy and bitter, but the bitterness is balanced out just enough by the malt backing and some subtle sweet fruit flavors that it doesnt detract much from the drinkability. 

Mouthfeel is spot-on: an excellent blend of lively carbonation with just enough smoothness.  The 10%ABV is remarkably well hidden, but nevertheless I wouldnt recommend tipping back too many of these in one sitting.

Unsurprisingly, hops are the clear & dominant aspect of this beer - theyre the first thing you smell, first thing you taste, and last thing you notice as it finishes with a somewhat dry bitterness.  If youre a hop lover you will not be disappointed.  Delicious.

1160,"2011-02-03",4.0,"I have been hunting for Hopslam since I missed it last January, and have been obsessed with trying it since I heard it once again arrived in Arizona.  Needless to say, my expectations were probably aimed a little too high than if I had simply stumbled upon this brew.  The aroma has all the usual trappings of a high gravity IPA, lots of citrusy hops, deep caramel/bready notes, and alcohol.  Bitter hops up front with a clean finish, but as the beer warmed more hops presented themselves and lingered on the palate.  Perfectly carbonated with a very dry finish (possibly due to the fermented honey).  A premier standard of what an Imperial IPA is all about, though I dont think there is anything truly special about this beer excluding its rarity.","USA","Someister"

For those of you who dont know, pot is like beer--educated folks know what theyze doin.  This beer tastes like skunkygum mixed with honey.  Anyone who likes this beer should consider smoking that type of weed.  They should also try Bells India Red Ale if they get the chance.  Theres some of that same unique flavor.  If you havent drank this you dont really know what beer can do.  Pretty sure fools are getting high off of the hops, btw.","CHICAGO, Illinois, USA","PRUCK"
1160,"2011-02-02",4.5,"The best thing about this beer is the aroma, it has a perfect hoppy smell with a wonderful matching flavor. For the strength of this beer it is very easy to drink with very little to no alcohol flavors. Everything about this beer was perfectly balanced and a must have beer for any hop lover.","Pennsylvania, USA","Stoked77"
1160,"2011-02-02",4.7,"It poured a crystal clear, bright and sparkling honey-golden-amber color with virtually no visible carbonation. I managed to build a 3-finger head through a vigorous pour, but once it settled, it held a creamy 2-finger white head of fluffy soap bubbles with excellent retention. There was quite a surprising amount of lace that lined the glass in intricate sheets while a thick island of large soapy bubbles mingled with a thin covering of minuscule bubbles that covered the rest of the liquid.

My nose was immediately vanquished by the aromas as I poured the beer from the bottle into the tumbler. As soon as I opened the bottle there was an enormous explosion (and I cannot stress how huge this was) of floral, grassy and citrus hops that bombarded my nostrils. The subsequent mushroom cloud offered a rich body of zesty grapefruit, sour orange, tart pineapple and even light melon notes near the edges. All of the hoppy-ness was beautifully rounded out with softer florals, fresh cut grass, and a sweet honey slathered over faint biscuity malts. Somewhere along the process of whiffing all this beer, some hints of pine managed to peek through, but they were far from consistent and stayed fairly well hidden. Overall, the scent was remarkably fresh and green - like walking through a botanical garden on a dry spring day. Even with all of huge aromas and the amount of hops that come out in the nose, nothing in the smell was overwhelming or burned. It may very well be on the best smelling beers Ive ever had the pleasure of sniffing.

Once it was finally in my mouth (though, honestly, this was the third Hopslam Ive had since it was released), there was a very bitter, tart, but crazy smooth wave of resiny pine flavor - or at least more than what was in the nose, though the zesty orange, grapefruit and even some lemon were definitely alive and kicking. Rather than being sharp and biting, like one might expect from a Double IPA packed with 6 different hop varietals, all of the hops were smoothed out fantastically with the sweet honey and light bready malts. Again, nothing was overwhelming or completely took out the other flavors; everything worked together perfectly, and in doing so, any trace of alcohol that might be expected from a beer with 10% ABV (holy wow) is obliterated. Due to the fact that the alcohol is so well hidden, Hopslam is very, very easy to drink, though being as smooth as it is and so well-rounded doesnt hurt either. I did find that when the drink first hit my lips, it started off dry, but by the time I swallowed, it almost felt slick across my tongue, ending only slightly dry and with a very light bitterness that gradually died away before the next sip. Holding a medium mouthfeel with light carbonation kept it from being spicy, and even though I found it difficult to pick out the alcohol, it definitely started hitting my brain after half the glass.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","lucklys"

Sure the artwork is cool and it only comes out for period of time every year. Unfortunately the taste is lacking anything overly original. Yes I know its got a grapefruit pucker to it, but I can buy a 3floyds Gumballhead and have a better experience and its available all year for half the price. I think this beer comes out once a year cause it wouldnt sell if it was on the  shelves all year long. Bells has some good beers, but I think they get to much praise for whatever they come out with.

Re-rated for 2012, not nearly as good as last year. poo on you bells! too malty no puckering in the back with the hop flavor, hops are present in aroma and taste but seems a bit on the mild side, like i got an old bottle though this was only bottled it says 1/09/12. so it couldnt be that.

Assertive but not overly done bitterness on the taste with some citrus and resinous pine followed by a light honey sweetness before the final malt backbone.  Drinkability is ridiculous.

1160,"2011-01-23",4.9,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2011 2/17/11 (Draft) 
5/5/5/4.5/5: Poured on tap into a Guinness pint glass at Ice House Pub in Punta Gorda, Florida on 2/17/11.

Appearance: Pours a clear light golden amber with orange highlights and a 2-3 finger frothy white head. Excellent head retention and lacing.

Smell: The most amazing bouquet of hops Ive ever smelled. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple and pine all mixed perfectly with just a touch of honey. Simply amazing.

Taste: The perfect balance between bitter and sweet, the malt is just enough to balance out the hops. The hops run the gamut from floral to bitter and sweet citrus. Theres a nice bitterness to the aftertaste that lingers for what seems like forever. This is the nectar of the gods.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol doesnt come through in the flavor at all. This is scarily drinkable.

Overall: Theres no better beer out there that Ive tried (yet). I thought nothing would top Hopslam in the bottle, but this did it. If you see Hopslam on draft, buy a pint - at least one. This beer was as close to perfect as I can imagine any beer being.

4.5/5/5/4.5/5: 

2011 Edition

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip. Batch code 10127 indicates bottling date of January 11, 2011.

Appearance: Pours a clear light golden amber with orange highlights and a perfect 2 finger creamy and foamy white head. Excellent head retention and lacing.

Smell: Perfect fruity aroma featuring orange, grapefruit and pineapple mixed with floral hops and pine. Hops are abundant. This has the best aroma of any beer Ive ever smelled.

Taste: Excellent balance between bitter and sweet. There is just enough malt background to even out this hoppy concoction. The hop profile ranges from floral to sweet citrus to bitter citrus. Sweet citrus with a little caramel malt up front followed by a hint of pepper and pink grapefruit in the middle followed lemon zest at the finish. Aftertaste is quite bitter in a great way.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol is masked extremely well for a beer with 10% ABV. The only detractor is the price. I paid $19.99 plus tax for a 6 pack at Total Wine.

Overall: About as perfect a DIPA as youll ever find. There is nothing to complain about here (aside from the price). I really wish Bells would make this a year-round release and drop the price a bit. If they did, this would be my go to beer without a doubt. If you see it, buy it.

1160,"2011-01-22",4.5,"I didnt see ""Casablanca"" until I was married and in my 30s. By that time, I had heard ceaseless praise and seen countless parodies of this classic picture. Yet, somehow, the real thing not only met these ridiculously high expectations; it shattered them, and remains one of the most affecting movies I have seen to date. This preamble gets me to my main point which is that, no matter how much praise you have heard for Hopslam, I assure you that the real thing is better than the advertising. I poured a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. The honey makes this light and drinkable, so not surprisingly it pours very much like a standard ipa. The appearance is reddish-orange with a thin cap and a ton of lacing. Palate-wise, it is also similar, with silky smooth carbonation lending a light body to a tremendously flavorful beer. The nose and flavor are much stronger, though, with intense hop juiciness, lemons, and pineapple in the aroma, and hop + alcohol burn dancing on the front of your tongue while the honey and malt pour salve on the back of your palate. An outstanding beer from an outstanding brewery.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"
1160,"2011-01-22",4.6,"Bells Hopslam has a huge, white head, but the color was paler than I had expected. The hop aromas hit me as soon as I opened the bottle. The aroma is chock full of the familiar hoppy flavors of grapefruit and pine. The flavor is very interesting. The hops are definitely there, and huge, but the addition to honey adds a sweet finish. Its dry, the hops linger longer than the honey, and you wont find better lacing.

Bells Hopslam does have a ton of hops, but I wouldnt say its as overpowering as I expected. Despite the 10% ABV, that isnt overpowering, either. Considering how much is going on, its amazingly well balanced.","Elida, Ohio, USA","mcnealc31"

Hopped to the max without being overly bitter.  Smooth as can be and as tasty as I have ever seen.  Booze in nowhere to be found making this SO drinkable its unfair.

Grapefruit, dank, almost cat piss-like hops, pine burst as well with some light vanilla notes, but nowhere near sweet.  Juicy comes to mind for the hop presence in this one, and grapefruit, pine, and some popping hop bursts hit the palate at every point.  Lingering hop burn, thats not too intense.  Warming, and not really that dry, but nowhere lingering around with some sweetness or anything close.  Touch sticky on the palate, and a thinner body for the style but it works because I hate when overly malted DIPAs end up almost barleywine-like.  Yep, Im a hophead, and that might skew my rating.

Very light head in the snifter, which takes a bit to settle. The brew is an alluring gold, similar to an apricot juice. The belt of bitterness that you saw coming is averted by the sweetness of the honey and fruit juices within. That being said, it is extremely hoppy, but pleasantly so.

The honey taste comes out and just as I thought that the hops were underwhelming..there it comes! The finish is extremely hoppy/bitter which is arguably the best finish of a beer that I have ever tried.

From the start it hits the tongue with a mellow, sweet bitterness that spirals down to ripe pinneaple, grapefruit and mangos, and ends with a slight honey malt bitterness that wraps the whole thing up. The palate is perfect on the mouth, not cloyingly sweet nor overly bitter. Overall, this is one of the best DIPAs on the planet. IMO, It is tied with Dreadnaught as my favorite.

1160,"2011-01-13",4.8,"Bottle.

A - Very crisp, clear light tangerine color with a large, thick, creamy, smooth looking white head with tiny bubbles. Pretty good retention leaving a thin, whispy lace.

S - Amazing hop aroma. Juicy grapefruit, pine resin, citrus, and floral aroma all present and jumping out of my glass. Very juicy and mouthwatering - essentially hop juice. A touch of sweetness and spiciness. Such a lovely aroma pretty much making me drool just on the first whiff.

T - Just like the nose suggested, hop juice flavor. Starts out with a strong cutting bitterness with some pine and spicy flavors. Some floral hop flavor then starts to come out segueing the spicy hops to the slightly sweeter grapefruit and citrus flavors. Some tropical fruit hops also make an appearance (particularly pineapple but others as well). Mid sip some sweet pale malt and slight sweetness comes out. Very nice balance to the bitterness, but in now way will it beat the bitterness out. The bitterness lingers after the sip with an amazing hoppy finish that lingers. Exactly what I want out of a DIPA, huge hop flavors with plenty of bitterness but there is a slight sweet balance.

M - Medium body closing in on full body. Great level of carbonation. Goes down very smooth. It just lacks this full viscous feel that I wanted. Just a little off from being amazing, but how smooth and creamy it feels and goes down, I wont complain.

D - Waaaay too drinkable for a 10% DIPA. Goes down so smooth and easy. This is such a joy to drink. Alcohol is very well hidden although it peaks its head every now and then. Strong hop and bitter flavors, but they arent overwhelming.

Notes: Batch 10094 bottled Jan. 04 2011. Wow this is just what I want from a DIPA. Dont know what else I can add. Such a great hop flavor, it is like drinking a wonderful hop juice elixir. All different kinds of hop flavors all show up. Just the right balance and goes down so easy. Such a joy to drink, if only it were made year round. I also love that the flavor lingers long after the sip is finished. Simply, I love this beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

3.5 A: Opaque darkish orange color. One finger of creamy head has surprisingly bad retention but leaves lots of lacing. Must be the 10% ABV, though plenty of other big IPAs have pulled it off.

5.0 S: Big burst of citrus hops. Grapefruit, pineapple, and orange. Theres a good pungency to it that I just cant get enough of.

5.0 T: Tons of fruity and piney hop flavor. The perceived sweetness in the fruitiness is thankfully balanced out with a strong bitter backbone to make this one hell of a sipper. The alcohol is essentially non-existent. The malts play a supporting role and do their job without demanding too much credit.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good carbonation, which is a bit surprising considering the lack of head (or perhaps the lack of head is why there is good carbonation). Bitter and sweet finish and aftertaste. I prefer a shitload of hops AND a good creamy body for a DIPA, but the creamy body is not to be found.

Pours beautifully. A golden, copper orange with a carbonated, creamy head of two fingers.

This smells wonderful. Im in a field - no! - a forest with a bed of fresh pine needles. Very floral. Citrus. Honey. Fantastic. Taste is a balance of the citrus, resiny hops, and a malty sweetness. Just the slightest bit disappointed after the nose that this isnt bigger, but thats probably due to the balance of sweetness and finishing bitterness.

Medium to medium-full. Sticky. Somewhat low carbonation, which I tend to like in bigger beers.

A: Bright orange and slightly cloudy. A white head with glimmers of the beer in it. 

S: Simply put, this is the most amazing nose Ive ever encountered. An overabundance of hops combined with a clear scent of honey, and a powerful malt base to back it all up. I know this scent will be good in a month or so, so I really need to savor it while its fresh.

T: Much like the nose, this is utterly without parallel (sorry to Mr. Pliny, I havent had the opportunity yet). This is how every DIPA should be made. The malt is certainly there, but does nothing to even content with the luscious hops that come on. Simply brilliant. The honey is certainly a nice touch, too.

The potency of the flavors masks the 10% alcohol, and although the label claims that this is ""a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser"", this one is remarkably drinkable.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"

1160,"2010-07-26",2.9,"12 ounce bottle.
Batch #9470, bottled in December of 2009.

A: Pours a slightly hazy orange with light white lacing. 
S: Aromas of melon and hops are prominent.
T: Melon and other citrus flavors show up, but they are absolutely dominated by the hop bitterness and alcohol burn, which linger.
M: Medium bodied and sticky with very high carbonation.
D: This is not a very drinkable brew, imo. Knowing this was a hop bomb, I tried aging it about 9 months, and its been 8. That didnt help this brew one bit, as the hop profile STILL annihilates any semblance of a malty balance, and not to my liking. After having and enjoying beers like Ruination and Arrogant Bastard, and even any of the DFH DIPAs, I feel like all of them are very well balanced, but this was not. Bad batch perhaps, but I have been unable to find any indication of the sort.

1160,"2010-07-08",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2013 Pours a fairly transparent amber with minimal white head.  Nose is really nice--grapefruit, hops and very fresh.  Not as hoppy as one would expect: Flavor is grapefruit, honey, and malt--probably too much malt in a IIPA for my taste, but, to be fair, I only just got ahold of this sixer from my dad when I was home over the 4th of July, so I imagine that the malty sweetness was once less apparent.  Im going to try to get ahold of more of this next year in more timely fashion, but even now it is a very good beer.  

EDIT: Im knocking this up on par with Three Floyds Drednaught and Stone Ruination after drinking it fresh this year.  The hops clearly fade fairly quickly if you let it sit too long, and, when fresh, theres still a bit of sweetness, but it is clearly from the honey (not malt) and the hops are front and center.  Nose is very floral with a bit of cat piss.  Just a fantastic beer.","Connecticut, USA","sepia5"

The most balanced uber hoppy beer I have tasted.  Its not over florally or citrusy. The honey and pine mix perfectly to dissolve that semi-bitter aftertaste usually associated with DIPAs.

Batch 10073 (Dec 29, 2010!) bottle on 1/12/2011

Not much more to report here, but Im not getting the level of aromatics that I remembered from last years bottle.  The nose is pleasant, fits how I described it last year, but is fairly subdued, its more like Hopkiss or a Hophint.

In the mouth, the alcohol is quite apparent. Quite hot actually. It is quite sweet but the malt provides very little body to offset the copious amounts of bitingly bitter hops. The hops are pretty unpleasant actually without the malt to offset the spice. It comes off exceedingly harsh. And thin! Long hoppy aftertaste.

Puts an unfiltered orange amber ale in the glass with a sturdy cap that leaves curtains of sticky lace on the glass.

Aroma is intense with exotic fruits-citrus-pine over rich caramel malty sweetness. Pungent fruitiness.

Thick body, slick mouth feel, deeply balanced character between hop acids and malt sugars.

Front side is a lush chew on caramalts, peaches, pine and citrus. Mid palate some complexity builds then a slow balanced finish with a hop bite at the end and alpha after sting left in your throat.

A beautiful big, hoppy ale with fantastic balance and depth...great malt mix and obviously hops added at boil, hopback infusion and dry hopping stages. One of a few big US Micro DIPAs with balance, depth of character and drinkability.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

Appearance - A beautiful pour with a thick white head and a rich amber color. A lot of lacing.
Palate - Thick and creamy on the palate. Medium-heavy body.
Taste - Surprisingly, very little alcohol burn for a 10.5ABV. The hoppiness of the beer is undeniable, but the bitterness is so moderated by the malty flavor up front that the bitter finish is welcome and necessary. Some pine with the citrus.

S-Nose is bright and blooming with citrus (mostly grapefruit) hops. Behind the citrus hops is a less prominent character of refreshing piny hops. Deep in the background is smooth caramel malt to balance out the hops.

T- I wish this brew tasted exactly as it smelled. Initial flavor is somewhat subtle and consists of mostly citrus hop flavor though both piny hops and caramel malt can be detected in the background. The citrus piny hop flavors strengthen for the finish. What is left to linger is some piny hop flavor, a very subtle flavor of caramel and a residual rind bitterness that is greater than moderate. The residual bitterness-to me- is borderline cloying.

P-Medium carbonation and smooth oily body that is full of hops. This is the kind of mouthfeel I wish were in every DIPA.

O- This is a very enjoyable DIPA but it didnt do anything magical for me. It would be near perfect if it tasted exactly how it smells-but it doesnt. The flavor is pretty good but didnt blow me away. The ABV is very well hidden here. The strengths definitely lie in the smell and mouthfeel of this one. Pretty good brew overall and one I will have again.

Very long citrusy and pine finish lingers in the mouth.  Well carbonated, medium bodied, nice dry finish. Goes down too smooth for a 10% beer.

The aroma is just stupidly hoppy, hop stink was a good way to describe it. It has some of that weird cat-piss kind of hop character which is somehow not at all gross. Tiny hint of honey as well. Flavour is again super-duper hoppy, delicious in that regard, but with a lot of honey biscuit sweetness and malts to balance it out quite well. I could throw this back way too easily, the abv is not very apparent at all, only after youve been drinking for a little while do you begin to feel the alcohol burn on the inside of your mouth.

Theres a very slight alcoholic hit in the end, but beer is an alcoholic drink and I dont think the alcohol always needs to be completely hidden. The caramel malt really shines. This one is definitely hop nectar. Delicious caramel malt and honey flavors provide an excellent backdrop for the huge hop flavor. The sweetness is there, and theres very, very little alcohol in the flavor for a 10% abv beer. The hop flavors are tangerine, grapefruit and a bit of wildflowers. The mouthfeel is excellent. Its smooth and syrupy in a good way. It has that great hop oiliness of big DIPAs. Its an easy to drink 10% abv, but its still a big beer and you feel that to some extent.

Then a caramel and passionfruit/melon sweetness shows up.  Lightly floral towards the end.  Flavor is similar citrus hops (with an orange zest), medium bready/caramel sweet, floral and finishes with a very smooth, medium-length bitter finish.

1160,"2010-03-29",4.9,"Bought a growler filled with this nectar of the gods at Roof Brothers Spirits in Paducah, Kentucky. We promptly finished the entire growler in one evening. :P

A: Appearance isnt this brews strong suit but thats not to say that it doesnt look great. Pours a classic amber with some heavier hints of oranges and reds. Carbonation is pretty spot on and active but this was predictable as we just had it bottled from the tap only hours earlier. Head was small with decent retention and lacing but I believe the head only suffered due to the pour from the growler itself.

S: The smell is of grassy, piney and DEFINITELY grapefruit/citrus hops. This is a grapefruit bomb in the nose. The scent is clean and to the point with carbonation showing off and pushing this hop perfume into your nostrils. Very nice!

T: One of the crispest beers Ive ever had... Its clean and the malt backbone is in place just enough for the hops not to overwhelm. Low on the side of bittering hops, the taste is as if one squeezed the fresh juices of a just ripened hop cone into their mouth: Truly a blessing for a hophead! On tap (like in this growler), the honey is not as present which I attribute to the honey (sugar) not being allowed to ferment as much as it would during the bottle-conditioning of shipping... Its there, its just not overstaying its welcome. All in all, this is a fantastic tasting beer that every beer geek should drink whenever possible.

MF: Again, this is a clean and crisp beer with spot on carbonation. Smooth is the word of the day but ""Nectar of the Gods"" is the phrase of the day. :P

D: Not sessionable, unfortunately. If this thing was 7% ABV and not 10%, I would drink this non-stop... One of these on tap, though, already had given me a nice buzz... By three in I was floating and rearranging my entire livingroom. The ""drinkability"" of one of these bad boys minus the limitations of sessionability is phenomenal.","Illinois, USA","seedsofchaos"

On the back of the palate, the hoppy bitterness kicks in with the orange peel, but it is also quite nice with the vanilla flavor.

1160,"2010-03-06",4.5,"My first double IPA, and hopefully not my last. I was hesitant when this beer was recommended to me by a friendly beer store employee, because I generally dislike the intense bitterness of the IPA style. In short, Im glad he pressed the issue.

The aroma was strongly citrus and piney hops, with an underlying sweetness apparent. Definitely hoppy, but nothing so aggressive as the name would suggest.

An unfortunate pour nevertheless left a one-finger white head on top of a fairly clear golden brew with a nice amount carbonation. Attractive.

On the front end, the taste is an IPA load of hops, balancing out perfectly with lingering notes of malt and honey sweetness. Very tasty, even with the 10% apparent. Im not ashamed to say that I went back to the bottle for the few last drops in the bottom after finishing my glass.

Palate was very substantial and long-lasting. Carbonation was perfect throughout, nicely augmenting the oily texture.

1160,"2010-03-04",4.6,"2010 review. Poured from the bottle into a Dogfish Head chalice. It pours with a nice 1/2"" head formed from a moderately aggressive pour. The color is a nice, clear golden orange with healthy carbonation levels. Its one of those thick, dense looking beers where the carbonation slowly creeps out. Quite nice, though. It has an insanely huge aroma, with sweet fruits and honey, citrus zest, cherries, floral and resinous notes... phenomenal. The taste is of candied maraschino cherries, resinous hops, with a bit of bite combined with an overwhelming sweetness that smooths it all out. There might be some mild tart apple in there, too. It was better on draft, but still so good in the bottle. The mouthfeel is ideal, with good density and carbonation, and a nice, mouth-filling consistency. Its one of the most famous beers around, and for good reason. A huge aroma and taste, with a perfect mouthfeel. Even with the big ABV, you want to keep drinking. A classic.","Michigan, USA","telix"

Hits you in the face with floral hops when you take a drink, followed by some citrus notes, a touch of sticky sweetness, and tailing off to a finish that coats the mouth with a mix of sweetness and pleasant hoppy bitterness.

It pours a deep gold color with a pillowy white head.  It has excellent head retention.  The nose is full of citrus and tropical fruit.  Lots of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, orange, and slight herbal notes.  The aromas fill the room.  The taste is solidly bitter with lots of enamel eathing hops.  The tropical notes make a return as well as some herbal and resin notes.  The malt is no slouch either providing a sweet honey taste.  This brew is simply delicious!

This beer is definitely over the top flavor wise.  The hop profile is both bitter and floral, and the malty and honey sweetness balances out the hops beautifully.

The aroma is still tops: massive piney hops with hints of malt. The taste and mouth feel are a little too harsh for me. The big sweetness doesnt really balance the hop bitterness and the alcohol comes to dominate. I do like this beer and did have a glass on tap the other evening at Busters with my bison burger and I liked it just fine, Its just that it has never lived up to what I remember, and maybe thats not all the beers fault.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","allendodd"

1160,"2010-02-09",4.3,"Bottle.

Pours a rather murky orange color with a medium-sized head that leaves some lacings. The color of the beer is surprisingly reminiscent of exotic fruit juice...

And so is the smell. This is almost ridiculous, so much hops and exotic fruit aromas. Grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, you name it. Some notes of pine-needles and a honey-like smoothness that seems to blend everything together and round everything off to a fantastic hoppy juicy whole. This is one of the most impressive aromas Ive ever come across in a beer. 

And the flavor is no disappointment either. I could easily describe this simply as hop juice. Grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, all kinds of exotic fruits come together in a beautiful combination that is really reminiscent of tropical fruit juice or nectar. The sweet and fresh malty backbone that isnt as ""caramelly"" as most malt profiles in Double IPAs are, really adds to this. Perhaps a note of nettles and tobacco. The finish is smooth with a prominent bitterness (again, much more restrained than most Double IPAs), pine-needle hops, grass and more juicy hops.

Its rather full-bodied and very smooth for the style, but still dry enough in the finish. This one drinks dangerously easy.

This is one of the coolest beers Ive had the pleasure to drink. Cant think of anything that taste like it. I mean, its actually hop juice.","Malme, SWEDEN","ricke"

1160,"2010-02-06",3.8,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a medium golden color with a reasonably dense white head.  The nose gives hints of the best of American hops.  Citrus, pine, and a bit of danky character make prevalent appearances.  The palate is, as one would expect, dominated by hop character.  Resiny flavor actually outdoes pure bitterness, but the former is a tremendous melange of notes, and is quite pleasing.  Malt character is pretty thoroughly shadowed, but there is a noticeable, if not specifically identifyable, background sweetness.  Alcohol makes a very slight flavor appearance, but is not especially obvious, and serves to add depth more than anything else.  The finish is clean and leaves a lingering hop character.  Overall, a very well made imperial IPA.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"
1160,"2010-02-06",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2011 Bottle.  Pours slightly hazy golden yellow with a small white head and quite a bit of lacing.  Aroma is overwhelming citrus and pineapple with some pine and maybe a touch of sweetness.  Flavor is pucker-your-face -- not so much bitter, but piney, tart, astringent, and a very soapy palette.  Its that last quality that I find just too odd and unpleasant.  Ill admit that in the great beer tango I tend to favor the malty partner, but this is just over the top.  No effort at balance or drinkability.  It does get points for being different.  But sort of tastes like cleaning product.  But I did like the aroma.  Kind of lick huffing pine-sol.
     Above is from over a year ago (original total score was a 2.6).  Just had it again last night, and Im much more favorably inclined this go around.   This time it was draft from a growler.

The flavor starts malty with lots of bready/cakey notes and a moderate malt sweetness.

The mouthfeel is quite full-bodied - slippery and nearing syrupy, but with enough carbonation to give levity and to provide the right level of tickle all over. Overall, a very nice beer.

1160,"2010-01-25",4.7,"The pale bronze colored body was very clear, and the head was small, which Im sure was due to the alcoholic strength.  The smell was a seductive mix of grapefruit, pine resin, and more grapefruit.  The taste was very citric and juicy to the core, almost hard candy like in its sweetness until smacking you down with a spicy hop finish.  The bitterness was quite low, but otherwise hops drove the show.  Sticky texture and long spicy aftertaste made this an enjoyable beer, which was surprisingly approachable despite the double digit ABV.  Bravo.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

 I try, i really try, to understand the sensation of this beer... it is good, I admit to that.  But why do you Hop Heads fall all over yourselves when you try this beer? A complex variety of hops stand up and smack you around, I know.  The beer is still somewhat ballanced I suppose, but I (regardless of the fact that I am a malt lover) just cant seem to appreciate what makes this so special to you.

Flavor is quite hoppy, with medium bitterness, grapefruit and tropical fruits, some earthy hops and finishes with a taste of honey and caramel malts.  A bit of lingering bitterness.  Alcohol is completely non-existent, quite a feat for a 10% ABV beer.  Mouthfeel is slick, a bit oily, low to medium carbonation, real smooth and easy drinker.

A good mix of different varietals of flavor and aroma hops, some noble hops in the mix to  to add hop complexity.  Not the bitterness I would expect from a beer this big.   A little more lackluster, watered down, and commercial than last year. Better on tap I noticed.  Thanks to Larry Bell for hanging out at Hops & Vines while we brewed our DIPA last week.

1160,"2010-01-24",4.5,"Draft at Uptown Grill. Bright yellow beer with very little head. Huge nose of citrus hops. Flavor is simply incredible--perfect balance of citrus and grassy hops, with amazingly little bitterness or hoppy bite. Peppery undertones. The underlying malt sweetness provides a perfect palate for the hop explosion. Had this in the bottle a couple days after having it on draft--still very, very good in the bottle, but better from the tap, if you can find it. From the bottle, an excellent beer. From the tap, a revelation, and probably the best DIPA Ive ever had.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","AtlAggie"

Wide array of hop scents -- lots of grapefruit/citrus, some pine/resin, and a fair bit of earthy/funky/forest floor hops, too, but there is a certain malt sweetness, faint though it may be, helps tie it all together. Theres good complexity here. Goes down smooth but a bitterness lingers; really nice carbonation. Bouncy but doesnt distract from the beers flavor at all. High ABV is well masked -- sometimes it almost comes out, but stays behind the scenes. Im not a big hop-head, but this is a really enjoyable beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","joechristenson"
1160,"2010-01-22",4.3,"I had Hopslam on tap and bought a 6pack last year (09), this is my first bottle of the 2010 edition.  Batch 9505 (packaged Jan 5, 2010, drank Jan 22, 2010) from a 12oz bottle into a Rouge pint glass.

Pours a fairly gold-to-amber color with a orange tint.  For some reason I had remembered this being unfiltered, which I prefer, but this is clear with only a faint haze.
No matter.  Decent looking beer I guess.

Oh, God.  Just the nose is arousing me.  I would buy a Hopslam scented cologne.
Probably the very best smelling beer I have ever smelled.  Founders Harvest might be the runner up for that ""award"".
Makes me want to dive headlong into it.  Tons of fresh juicy grapefruit on the nose, a little pine in there too.  Slight bit of alcohol on the nose, but not that much, esp. considering this is 10 percent.

Rich mouthfeel, some sweetness and a lil more prickly alcohol than the nose had.  What has always made Hopslam interesting, to me, is that it isnt just another OMG REALLY HOPPY DIPA!.  Everyone makes one of those.  Hopslam is a really hoppy beer that has other stuff going on too.
Hop character on the palate is good, but not quite all that the nose promises.  I dont want to be ""that guy"" but I kind of feel like it was a little sharper last year.  It obviously still provides plenty of hop character though.  Not quite as grapefruity on the palate as the nose is, maybe a little more herbal character.  Still pretty juicy though.

Flavor is a blast of hops, much more powerful in resin flavor than the usual west coast grapefruit shot.

Aroma has a smell of grapefruit and a bit of sweetness. On the first taste there is a fair amount of bitterness but it is tempered by the honey. alcohol is hidden decently. However, on the aftertaste there is a lingering bitterness but it is distinctly more from a grapefruit than anything else. For all the hype and the price of this beer, it is a little disappointing I think. Its still a good beer overall, but for all the hype it just feels like Ive been drinking alcoholic Ruby-Red grapefruit juice and not much else.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","ruskiimperial"

The first aroma i get is fresh cut pineapple. Grapefruit and citrus also but pineapple in the forefront. I could stick my nose in this and smell all day long.

Wow. Im hit it the face with sweetness right off the bat. It tastes like the juice left at the bottom of a fruit cup.

The flavour profile matches the aroma in every aspect. Lots of fresh bitter pine, zest of citrus, bubblegum, and fruity malts that taste of fresh tropical fruit.

It pours a clear amber color with about an inch of white head. Wonderful full floral, hoppy aroma. Strong wonderful flavor that is balanced between the honey sweetness and hoppy bitterness, so neither is overwhelming. After the initial taste you then get a slam to the face of hops, which continues to tantalize your palate until you take your next sip. Bitter, but not as bitter as I expected it.

1160,"2010-01-17",4.5,"Ive been trying to find this one for two years!! Living in a small town with limited distribution, they only got a handful of six-packs.  Luckily got the last one after randomly walking into our local specialty store.  

This is the most incredible nose Ive ever experienced.  The hops dominate, as would be expected, with scents of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, and honey.  The appearance wasnt as opaque or turbid as I was hoping for such a strong beer, but the nose is enticing enough to make a bud-light look good.  In terms of flavor, this hands down now the one to beat in the double IPA category.  I have never tasted an imperial this smooth.  Unlike many beers where the nose is strong, but the flavor pales in comparison, this beer tastes just like the nose!  Very citrusy, some hints of floral, almost rosewater tasting, and the honey is very prevalent with an excellent balance to the hops.  Despite the advertisement, this is NOT a bitter beer.  It is less bitter than a number of even single IPAs Ive tasted, but the flavor is incredible.  Almost reminds me of a fresh-hop ale with a lot more kick and balance.  The mouthfeel is almost perfect, thick, but not syrupy, and a perfect amount of carbonation and a long finish.  This is quite possibly the best beer I have ever tasted.","Los Angeles, California, USA","slimweebs"
1160,"2010-01-17",4.5,"Location: 12 oz bottles from Norms, 1/16/10 and 1/17/10


Aroma: Wow, that is a wonderful nose.  This one has lots of fruit: orange, peach, apricot, and others, along with with some honey, earth, and flowers.  Wonderful start to this beer. 

Appearance: This beer pours a clear orange color with a big fluffy white head that lasts for a while and leaves a lot of lace on the glass.

Flavor: The taste is lots of fruity hops with some honey and some caramel malt character, too.

Palate: The mouthfeel is sticky and resiny with a medium body, and a nice duration.

Overall Impression: 
Ive been meaning to try this beer for years, but I kept missing its release.  Well not this year, and man am I glad I finally got to try it.  I drank one of these yesterday, but I held off a day on rating it to make sure I wasnt imaging how good it is.  Well, I wasnt imagining anything, I am absolutely loving this beer.  You might say the price is too high, but I thought it was well worth the $20 I paid for the 6 pack.  Awesome stuff, this beer is clearly world class.  Should I have gotten a second 6 pack?  Yes, I should have.  Is this beer better then the Pliny, Ruination, or Yulesmith?  Hard to say, but Id be glad to drink any of them anytime (and many times) to try and figure it out.  I need to end this rating here, because otherwise I could probably rant about this beer for hours, it is just wonderful.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
1160,"2010-01-16",5.0,"Ok, I never thought I would give a perfect score but here it is.  First of all, i was only hoping that this would slightly live up to its reputation, and it far exceeded it.  From the moment that I poured it, I could tell that I was in the presence of greatness.  Bottle pours a brilliant orange-amber with a creamy, 2-finger, peach-colored head that leaves some nice lacing.  The aroma is like walking through multiple fruit orchards at the same time. Honestly one of the most multi-dimensional smells ever, showing fresh peaches, apricots, grapefruit, lychee, pineapple, orange, tangerines and pine. I could smell this stuff all day. This is all carried over and complimented with sweet caramel, honey, and what seems like cookie dough at times.  Alcohol is masked extremely well and only makes its presence subtly known. The overall mouthfeel is moderate and sticky with a perfect amount of bitterness on the finish.  Fruit cornucopia aside, what really impresses me is the superb balance.

It was excellent. The ABV was very subtle and did not become overbearing which allowed the hops and citrus to really take center stage.

Pours a very bright orangey-amber color with medium sized white cap that receds nicely to a good rim layer, with plenty of residual lace.  

Nose is very bright with fresh fruit.  Literally those nose on this compared to other DIPAs is like comparing fresh squeezed OJ to some generic brand made from concentrate.  Fresh, citrusy, floral, a delight...  While I get mostly orange and grapefruit theres also some miscellaneous tropical fruit that I cant nail down - maybe mango, pineapple, apricot perhaps.

On the palate Im amazed at the honeyed & gently sweet flavors that start things off for the big hop flavors that follow.  Although theyre full-flavored, theyre not overwhelming like a Double Bastard, for example.  Just right for this style, IMO.  Alcohol is masked relatively well and this is a delight to drink.

Original rating: I will admit it. I am jaded when it comes to hoppy beers and feel like most brewers seem to be suffering form delusions of grandeur when describing their IIPAs and the like so believe me when I tell you than when I put my nose to the top of my glass of Hopslam and went, ""Hooooo! That is hoppay!"" it was completely involuntary and a testament  to the insane care Bells must have taken w/ their aroma hop additions. It smells honey sweet and smooth w/ loads of fresh fruity hops. It comes sweetly across the tongue revealing further floral and pine notes and leaves w/ a resiny, borderline soapy bitterness. The overall impression is surprisingly light and would dare even call it refreshing. Really, just an exceptionally well made beer.

1160,"2009-12-30",3.5,"Bottle shared with tashi at my ""All my US bottles from GBBF need drinking"" tasting, 16th Aug 09. This bottle came from the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam however. Golden amber with a peristent small white head. Alcohol is noticeable, no matter what some previous raters say. Very clean tasting - no hefty aftertaste, a bit short, but there is some lasting hop bitterness & alcohol warmth. Swirling it releases some nice grassy & floral North American hop aromas, but this certainly didnt live up to its billing.

1160,"2009-11-23",4.1,"BATCH #8277(01-09-08) This one is a year old. Ill review a fresh one, once I can track down a bottle. Someday....

Nice, hazy, dark golden honey colored liquid. Two-finger head of thick off-white colored foam. Great retention and thick, sticky lacing.

Nice citrus hops are still big with this one. Orange and grapefruit, mostly. Hint of pine. Nice caramel malt presence, now. Nice floral quality.

Hops have definitely mellowed out. Quite abit, Id guess. Still has a nice piney/grapefruity quality. Also has quite the caramel malt backbone, now. Its really a very balanced beer, right at this point. The honey is easily detectable, also, and I find it to be a very nice component in this brew.

Good solid medium body. Almost sticky, the way it coats your mouth. Traces of it stay there, even after you swallow, then slowly make their way down your throat.

At this age, I find this to be a super drinkable beer. Very well balanced and all around tasty.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

Update 9/23/2010: Sadly, my stock of this years batch is down to just 1 bottle from the 4 cases I had. This really is the perfect DIPA: Clear hops, balanced with honey, citrus, and some herbaceous qualities. I look forward to next years batch. If you prefer it with a harsher edge, drink it very cold.

Aroma is dominated by pineapple with hints of peach, vanilla, and a little raspberry. Definitely the fruitiest non-citrus aroma Ive ever smelled from an ipa.

Why are so many of my favorite beers being  consumed in motels these days? Either I have exquisite luck finding great beer while traveling or I simply have more freedom to sample when Im away from home. Anyhoo...this is a really wonderful beer. Again, on opening the hops jump out at you...but this time they are leafy, fresh and very citric. The palate is so full with hops and yet the malt balance really does make this beer so much more than one dimensional. Someone else compared this to DFH 90 min and I have to say I prefer this beer...its more refined, more even keeled. Id draw another analogy to women but Im starting to sound like a guy who equates beer rating to sex which isnt really fair...since when I sample beer my performance has nothing to do with my enjoyment!

1160,"2009-08-22",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2011 Thanks to Beerman6686 for hooking me up with this in a trade. Pours an extremely clear amber with a small bubbly white head. Aroma is excellent; lots of sweet oranges, a bit of grapefruit, caramel malt, and some floral notes at the finish. Flavor is definitely even more impressive than the aroma. Thick, sugary start to the flavor, with lots of caramel. It then moves to an aggressive floral, pine, and citrus hop flavor, with lots of alcohol tinge mixing with well placed carbonation to fully encapsulate the tongue.  Very very nice, but I feel that the overall flavor of the Alesmith IPA I just rated was more complex. The alcohol is awesome, but it portrays the difference between single and double IPAs very aptly. Still a top notch brew.

1160,"2009-05-22",3.7,"Big thanks to MrChopin for including this one in a recent trade. Pours an orangeish honey amber, with a mid-sized, off-white head. Theres enough sweetness in here to really counter the hops in the aroma. Honey, some light brown sugar and caramel malts  but you can tell there is a huge hop contingent waiting behind the malt cover for the right moment to smack you around. Geez  there it is! The flavor is a big hop bomb, but the acerbic qualities you usually find in something this loaded arent there  could be the honey? It has some definite grapefruit / other bitter citrus notes, but it actually seems pretty one-dimensional. A muted hop wave, with a harshly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is great  its a thick brew, with a nice, vibrant carbonation, producing that velvety feel I like so well but I just cant seem to get on board with the flavor. Really glad I got to try it, but Im a little disappointed for this highly rated of a brew.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

1160,"2009-05-09",4.1,"Vibrant orange with amber streaks and a top-hat of orange tinted foam. There is a bit of a mysterious haze about her person, but Bells doesnt filter their beers, so that is to be expected. Her crowning glory fades into a gentle ring while taunting swirls tease clumpy marks of lace and foam. Unbeknownst to me, such risky teasing of her tumultuous depths has released a beast of a nose. Oranges dripping with honey, melon glistening in the summer sun, sticky pine needles, sweet cut grass, and a hint of lathered soap. Like a dank tropical rainforest, my Hopslams nose cannot and will not be reined in. Further citrus explodes onto the scene with pink and red grapefruit while crushed spent grains and cracked wheat are drizzled with crusty caramelized honey. Magnifique. Submission is my only peaceful option, so I give myself into her call and find myself happily drowning in a sticky-sweet honey froth of tropical fruits, zesty citrus, and forestry esters. All porous cavities are slick with lightly caramelized honey while orange pulp, grapefruit, crushed pine needles, and grass sit atop my tongue and never leave. Lightly peppered cracked wheat adds depth to her palate while lingering in the back of my throat along with more delicate notes of honey. As my palate slowly dries, each quaff refreshes and repeats the whole process all over again.


Having bravely tested the rumors of greatness, I can say without a doubt that they are true. Once more Bells lays the smack down upon the kingdom of beer, establishing a prominent standing. I believe there can never be a dominant position because there are so many great breweries brewing equally great beers consistently, but if there really were a kingdom of beer, then Bells and Hopslam would be of noble standing.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Its like the Noahs ark of IPAs 2 of every kind of hop theyve got plus a few more to keep things interesting.  Alcoho isnt even a factor.  Cant tell its there at all.  This beer isnt all about the hops though, its actually got a strong enough malt backbone to prop up all that hoppy goodness.

I am glad I did not review some of the previous bottles I received in trade. They were a little calm compared to a fresh hopslam. THIS IS CLOSE to being the best DIPA when its fresh!.

Nose - straight up grapefruit, citrus, piney. man its an explosion in the olde nasal cavity.

appearance - little cloudy, copperish orange color. Little head.

Mouthfeel - little tangy on the front end and then grapefruit. Mellow out on the finish and leave a smooth refreshing aftertaste.

This is one fine brew. I can sit here a sniff it all freaking night,.

Dangerous abv manifests itself as an actinic ethanol blade; that plus a peppery hop nip smoothly cleave the medium-full mouthfeel.

You get a nice aroma and can taste the honey wthi this one.  I am going to piss a lot of people off but I do think it is too straightforward with the honey and leaves the palate too fast.  I dont think I would take issue with this if I did not also feel that this beer is a bit overhyped.  When everyone thinks something is so perfect or thinks they think something is so perfect then it is hard to live up to that reputation.  It is excellent though and also hides the alcohol really really well.  I think personally that this also takes away from the complexity as well.  I like drinkability, but not so much in a double IPA such as this because when I have a really good double IPA I want to have to search for the flavors a bit more.

Nose is pronounced strongly with pine sap, grapefruit pith, and some floral spring flower / marijuana notes.  Swirl it around and froth up the head a little to give it an extra bump in aroma.

Flavor is not terribly bitter.  Sugared Ruby Red Grapefruit, lemon, pine and herbs.  A little bitterness up front that is quickly checked by a toasty, caramel malt sweetness.

1160,"2009-03-16",3.9,"As usual, Bells produces one of the best beers in the style.  Im sick to death of Imperial this, Double that, blah blah blah, but this one seemed somewhat complex and even a little different in a crowd of overdone, unbalanced, and generally pointless experiments into the world of ""more is better"", which is rarely the case.  At any rate, this one poured a big golden haze with a huge Kool Whip-like head on top.  Aroma is fairly predictable but good nonetheless.  Big notes of pine, almost overwhelming cascade goodness, and hint of caramel.  Flavor is more of the same, big fat cascades dominate and dry the tongue, with an underlying honey sweetness.  This creates some semblance of balance, and there is some malty breadiness present towards the end.    4 years ago, I would have rated this a perfect 5, but Im sick to death of these ridiculous beers.

Pours the color of polished copper, a glowing hazy gold-orange, with foamy moderate off-white head that fades quickly.

Nose is grapefruit rinds and a big floral note, almost herbal. All hops, with a bit of sweet caramel malt behind trying to break through. A bit of piney astringency as well.

Big and bold on the tongue, carbonation may be a touch aggressive. Some caramel up front, underneath a slightly astringent big, heavy rind-like citrus bitterness. both aspects seem to grow towards the finish, the caramel getting bigger and more intense and the astringent hop note pairing with the citrus to really explode on the swallow. A bit of alcohol heat comes through as well. Finish is long, bitter.

Mouthfeel is fairly sharply carbonated, a bit syrupy.

Overall, disappointed in this one. Granted, this one isnt quite fresh - but the big flavors seemed a bit disjointed, and lacking in complexity and subtlety. The huge sweetness coupled with the piney astringency was a bit much in this one. Would have like for the massive sweetness to have been toned down just a bit.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

Re-rate (1/29/13, original rate 3.8) - Had this many times over the years, and I cant say I love it anymore. Its too sweet and malty for my tastes, so much so that the hops get lost in the stickiness. Its also sharper and boozier that I remember initially.

1160,"2009-03-02",4.6,"Being new to hoppy beers, I have had a difficult time becoming accustomed to some of the complexities of the style.  Bells HopSlam is one of the first beers of its type that could really get behind when it comes to an IPA.   

With an exceptionally clean finish, this beer goes down easily considering its heavy hop presence and high ABV; it has a diverse enough flavor profile to cover up the astringency that can often come with the alcohol.  Separating itself from many IPA style beers, the aroma hops are not only potent and present, but complex and pleasant.  There are hints of citrus and other floral scents on the nose.   It has a really nice mouthfeel.  It was strong but not overpowering.  

Partly due to the style, this is not the kind of beer I would drink six of in an evening (partly due to the fact that someone would have to pick me up off the floor).

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Despite being pretty hot off the press, this has a surprisingly simple and timid nose...what little thats there is pleasant enough, but its unusual for an IPA or DIPA to have so faint of an aroma.

1160,"2009-02-22",4.1,"Review is of an Oak Aged Firkin poured at Richos in New Albany, IN.

Poured an opaque tan with hints of red and rust throughout with what appeared to be yellow near the bottom of the narrow glass. Had a bit of a white foamy head.

Nose was hoppy and bitter with a touch of a floral character.

Upon sipping I was caught off guard. I know Hopslam is a real kick in the teeth but this thing was very mellow and subdued. The hoppy bite had given way to an almost creamy subtlety and complexity. Peach and other citrus fruits are very apparent. There is a bit of a bitter ending with a short clean finish. 

The mouthfeel, as stated is smooth and almost creamy.

I consider myself a minor hophead but this was a little too intense for me.  It was overwhelmingly hoppy without even a pretense at trying to be balanced.   That wouldnt have been so bad had the hops not been so sour.  They werent even citrusy or piny, just sour.  The one thing I did enjoy about this beer was the lack of alcohol flavor.

Enough to dust off the ol cap-cracker and dig in.  Popped this sucker, and immediately, was overwhelmed by wisp and wasps of honey due, and a bouquet of hops Garden of Eden style, served sunny-side-up.  A further sniff and huff of the fragrant aroma and the fine folks at Method should certainly consider to market.  Pours a lively gold and fuzzy hue.  Taste bites even before the palate is wet.  Hops, o glory of hops, fancy wedding bouquets of flowers, honeydew strong enough to fight off the imaginary hummingbirds that the 10% ABV provides me.  Pine notes mix in like a love affair with the Alps, and a chewy gentry of warm, moist banana bread.  Convergence of a syrupy like texture tends to slow down de addict like consumption, into a full 5 course, savored meal.

Smooth body boasts a nice bitter kick without going over the top and has a strong sweet backbone that comes just to the edge of being syrupy.

1160,"2009-02-15",4.1,"12oz single from Total Wine, $4.    A sixer was priced at $18, too high to interest me.    Aroma on opening is a rush of sweet hops, piney and citric.  Golden amber beer with a small head.  Flavor is all about the hops, but with enough pale malt and honey sweetness to keep it from becoming oppressive.   Full, sticky, honey-sweet pallete.  The 10% ABV is completely obscured  by the hop flavor and sweetness.  The IPA bitterness is up front, and is overtaken by the sweetness at the end.   Definitely a sipper, but fairly well balanced to be so extreme.  This beer and possibly the Stone Ruination are on the ragged edge of extreme IPAs.  Kudos to Bells Brewery for producing a brew of this intensity.   Enjoyable and interesting to try, but at these prices not something I would buy more than once or twice.

The flavor represents a delicious combination of pefect hops and just enough sweet honey.  I dont quite understand how the ABV is 10%!

Pretty straight forward very hoppy, but there is some sweet malt with the honey, and some citrus and apple. Finishes real clean, for those that like a hop belch, this will do it for you. Tastes like a really really good pale ale. I was expecting this to be just a bite in the rear bitter beer, but it was quite well balanced and dangerously drinkable. The most drinkable double Ive had. Was not an earth shattering experience, but Im glad I tried it.

Redolent of citrus, cantaloupe, grapefruit, pine, leafy hops, honey, and clover. Flavor is sweet and mellifluous up front then immediately strikingly bitter on the back of the tongue, however the bitterness almost lacks the clarity of the usual coniferous or citric bitterness thats expected; its just really bitter. Very sweet and reassuring malt base cuts through the bitterness but is then re-enveloped by a spicy bitter bite at the end. The body is carbonated strongly but not cloying and conspires with the alcohol to exacerbate the bitterness. The use of honey was perfect but lent no undue viscosity and the body was perfect.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","Jsawyer"

1160,"2009-01-30",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2012 12oz bottle. Batch 8907. Pours clear copper with nice soapy white head. Aroma is wonderfully citrusy and hoppy with some sweet maltyness. Flavor is citrus, pine, sweet malt and bitter hops. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy with sweet malt. A nice DIPA but a bit over rated. 
Re-Rate: The aroma is great, Flavor is nice. Still a little to much sweet malt for my palate but this is a good IIPA. I think I was expecting a little to much the first go around.  A fine beer it but stil not worth its lofty rating.
Re-rate: 2012. After years of drinking DIPAs at this point I must say this, when fresh is one of the top 2 or 3 DIPAs out there. i drank a whole case this year and it is outstanding and has stood the test of time.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"

Doesnt have the creaminess to the aroma that alot of DIPAs have...  Flavor of piney hops, a bit of citrusy though not the big citrus from the aroma, and a touch of honey, doesnt live up to the aroma or the hype for me... Also by the by, i dont get the tongue bruise i was promised... Great balance for a double ipa(usually i dont like big double ipas mainly because of the creaminess/fullness of the mouthfeel)... Big thick sticky mouthfeel, you can detect the alcohol by feel, but not by taste... Mildly bitter, mildly sweet finish... Good, nearly great, but way way overhyped and overpriced, the marketability of limited supply vs huge demand in action....","West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA","jeff789"
1160,"2009-01-30",4.4,"12oz bottle batch 8907. Thanks a ton to 17thfloor for this! Pours golden orange with a thick creamy white head. Aroma is very fresh pungent herbal hops and hop oils. Lots of pineapple and citrus zest with a nice creamy caramel malt backbone. Flavor starts with a soft sweet pineapple mellowness and lays soft on the tongue. But as soon as you start to swallow you get hit by a huge rush of hop oil bitterness that stays all the way down the throat. The alcohol is well hidden but you can detect that it is a heavier beer. Medium to full body and lively carbonation. This is very nice, much like Two Hearted and a great example of good balance with high hop and alcohol.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"
1160,"2009-01-29",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2009 12oz bottle, batch 8907.   Mostly clear deep gold-orange color with a small white head that leaves some spotty lace.   Citrus, melon rind, alcohol, sweet honey, and spicy herbal hop aroma.   Quite sweet, with a touch of honey and bread.   Some fruity, citrucy hop flavor and a finish that almost gets dry and bitter until the sweetness comes back in and sticks to the back of the tongue.   Medium bodied and rather light feel overall, which helps to partially mitigate the sweetness.   This could use either a ton more hops, or a much dryer finish.   Ill stick to two hearted. (7,4,6,4,13=3.4)

Rerate: Same batch, a couple more bottles have been mused over.   Impressions: The aroma is a nice citric-fruity hop and sweet honey malt combo, though its a bit light for a double IPA.   The flavor, while still falling more on the sweet side, is dryer than I had previously thought.   Its not the residual sugar so much as the lack of stronger bittering hops that set the balance this way.   I think that the fruity hop flavor and more modest bitterness combine to give a sweet, fruity overall impression.   It is growing on me.   A balanced and very drinkable IIPA.   The body is about as light as I can imagine a 10%abv beer being.   If it werent for the alcohol presence, this could be almost a regular IPA.   While I more intense and complex overall hop character could transform this beer into something amazing, it is still enjoyable and deserves a couple more points. (7,4,7,4,14=3.6)
Rerate: on tap at Brickskeller.   More bitterness and assertive hop flavors, still very drinkable.   Freshness seems to be the world in this beer.   Hopslam has beer my learning experience with balanced IIPAs, and I like it more every time I have it. (7,4,8,4,15=3.8)

1160,"2009-01-29",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2010 Can Larry Bell live up to the hype again? 

12oz. bottle purchased from Top Shelf Liquor in Allen Park. 

As soon as I pop the cap, the excellent aroma lets me know Im in for something special. 

Appearance: Pours a nice golden orange hue. This is slightly hazy due to the yeast that I poured into my Bells snifter. Nice off-white head with nice lacing. Very inviting... 

Smell: What an excellent aroma. Starts with a slight hop burn follow by grapefruit, pine, and citrus. You can almost taste the hops...My fricking mouth is watering. 

Taste: Tastes just like the aroma. Nice hops up front with grapefruit, pine and citrus notes. Malts come to the party later on to add a beautiful balance to this masterpiece. 

Mouthfeel: Nice smooth mouthfeel. The hops hang around for a bit and coat the tongue and roof of my mouth. 

Drinkability: I could definitely put back a sixer of these, but Id rather savor this bad ass Double IPA with one or two. Hoppy, malty, and exceptionally balanced. 

The first time I tried this, I had it next to Rouge I2PA and DFH 90 min. IPA. This was exceptional compared to the other two. The Rouge wasnt too bad, but the 90 tasted like a malty barleywine. I used to think the 90 was a hop-bomb....not anymore. I would love to try this next to Dreadnaught...from memory, they are similar except for the fact the a 22oz of Dreadnaught was $9 and a sixer of Hopslam came out to be about $12. 

Once again, Larry and the Bells crew put out an excellent beer. If its not the best double IPA, then its definitely in the top five. This should be the new benchmark for the style. Hopefully Bells decide to make this a more regular offering. Pick this up if you see it...you will not be disappointed.","Allen Park, Michigan, USA","northernbrews"

Five of us passed this one around and each person gave an immediate WOW upon smelling.  Appearance: The beer is a warm early evening sunshine orange and is mostly clear.  I was surprised that it wasnt a little more opaque due to the amount of hops.  Flavor: WOW! This is an insanely tasty beverage.  It tastes just like it smells.  Considering its name and bottle label, it is surprisingly easier on the palate than you would think. The Flying Saucer has it here on draught, and I had no problem kicking back three of them.  Palate:  Again, this one goes down very well and has great mouth feel.  It stood up to the spicy nachos I was eating, so I imagine it will stand up to just about anything.

The color is a lighter shade than I remember, more of an orange-yellow with a nice whitish foam.  The aroma is heavily dominated by citrusy hops and some florals that might come from the honey.

Taste is of sweet, almost juicy hops with grapefruit, pine, and caramel malt. Lingering grapefruit taste. Alcohol content is well masked within the other flavors. This beer is not nearly as bitter as advertised. Instead it is an overly sweet, drinkable beer. With a name like Hopslam, I expected facerape. It is a very good beer though.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
1160,"2009-01-19",4.7,"Just in Wednesday, January 14th, 2009.  I have been waiting for this years offering because it is one of the best doubles that I have had.  Now maybe its my imagination, but it seems to be slightly different from last year offering.  After I had my first, I was so impressed that my hophead brother in law and I popped open a bottle of Dreadnaught just to compare.  We truly thought it had more character in all the right places and was actually better than Dreadnaught, which up until now had been my favorite all time.  This beer is so far above Yulesmith and at $18 a six pack is a great value.   On a per/oz. basis, it is half the cost of Dreadnaught.  This year it seems more balanced, slightly sweeter in a very subtle way.  Its 8 AM and Im craving one now.  If youre a hophead, this is liquid gold.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","beerater"
1160,"2009-01-18",3.7,"Nice tropical aromas of pineapple, grapefruit and lime.  Nicely balnced for a beer thats supposed to be loud.  However, this didnt blow me away, and for the proice theres other things out there.  Infact, you can almost buy 2 six packs of  two hearted ale for this price!

1160,"2009-01-18",4.2,"In the realm of Imperial IPAs, I definitely do not like paying nearly $20.00 for a sixer.  Seriously, at that price I would hope to get some form of sexual gratification with it.  Aroma of this is heavy on the floral side, not as citric as, say, a Stone offering.  There is also just the slightest notice of honey in there.  Gotta love it.  Flavor actually does give me a half, maybe three quarters stock.    This is the third straight IIPA I have had, Gemini then Founders Double Trouble, and now this, and this one is going down the quickest.  The flavor just begs fore more.  Its hoppy- sweet, but not sugary, bitter, but not overpowering, and just the right blend of spice from hops blending with the honey.  OK, this may be worth the money, occasionally.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"
1160,"2009-01-17",4.4,"Appearance:  A dark auburn-orange with an eggshell white, creamy head. After sipping, sudsy lace remains.

Aroma:  Green pear,mandarin orange, and peaches. I also find a smell associated with Orange Jell-o.

Taste: Orange, mango and tart peach. After the wonderful lineup of fruit flavors, I get a mouthful of piny, spicy bitter hop notes. The level of sweet malt held all this fruity and spicy hop goodness together, but didnt seem ""sugary.""

Mouthfeel:  A tad astringent, a bit on the heavy side, but not syrupy.  The flavors linger for a while without coming across as sticky.

Overall:  My first Bells beer, and I am very impressed.  I am a fan of an over the top Double IPA, and usually brace myself for something chewy or something that makes me pucker. This beer somehow packed all those hops in without compensating balance.  Worth all the hype it receives.

Immediately you get a strong floral, slightly fruity hop flavor. I note roses, orange blossoms, and apricots. The bitterness slowly grows to overpower the delicate flavor, and lingers.

A huge hops flavour, a lot of evergreen taste that doesn’t come out so much in the smell. Citrus notes, and a dash of sweetness, presumably from the honey comes through. 

Thick and slick... quite an oily consistency that leaves its residue like a thin film before slipping into a clean finish.

Poured a dark amber-golden with medium clarity and medium to heavy carbonation with a slight white head.  The hops are apparent at quite a distance, and once you actually put your nose in it, you’ve reached the motherland.  On the tip of the tongue, the bitter hops are already being absorbed, and upon swallowing, the piney flavor melds with the monster hops to the most pleasurable blend imaginable.  It’s medium to heavy bodied and a true hop-SLAM, yet goes down smooth and remains extremely drinkable.

The 10% alcohol is also prominent, but not in a bad way.

Some light fruitiness in there as well, maybe cherry and peach, and a slight alcohol astringency.  I have an inkling that the hoppiness would be damn near overpowering were it not for the abundance of honey, which brings out some sweet fruitiness and light herbal tea undertones without sacrificing the huge pine and citrus hops.

Worth the hype and the $17.99 price tag per six-pack. Fantastic beer. (9,5,9,5,17).
Original Rating on 7/12/2008 and updated on 1/30/2009. On tap at the flying saucer in KC!!! WOW!!! Pours a golden orange, hazy body with a finger-width, dirty white, dense and foamy head that dissipates slowly and remains extremely lacy. Sexual. Aroma loaded with pineapple citrus hops. Some earthy notes to it and a good amount of sweet maltiness. Juicy aroma! Juicy flavor! Very very very fresh tasting citrus hoppiness that tastes just like Im biting into a just cut pineapple. Explodes in the mouth. Semi-sweet maltiness balances the juicy hop explosion very well. Finishes with a residual honey sweetness that is very unique to the style. Palate is actually light to medium bodied and very crisp and refreshing. Overall, a fantastic DIPA. Extremely drinkable and loaded with intense juicy flavor. Phenomenal beer. (10,5,9,5,19=4.8).","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Just fantastic all around.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
1160,"2008-07-06",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2010 In short: Solid crisp and sweet malt backbone assertive complex hop profile.  When fresh this is the measuring stick of the style
How: Bottle 12oz, fresh, many times, always as fresh as possible
The look: Almost clear golden body topped by a medium white head with good retention
In long: Nose of grapefruit, citrus, pine-tree and caramel.  Solid and crisp sweet malt backbone.  Quite a bit of honey as well as some oily caramel.  This thing has a ton of hops, it needs to with that malt profile.  Perfect balance here and the malts are just as expressive as the hops.  Interesting complex hops profile with flavours of citrus, grapefruit, pine-tree and more Alcohol a little apparent but not distractive.

Smell is very nice too, plenty of pine and fresh grapefruit to treat your nose. Taste was very hoppy, as expected. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, various other citrus flavors were also noticed. Bitterness was certainly present, but not a harsh bitterness, was more about hop flavor than IBU’s. Medium body with a medium carbonation pair quite well with this one. Very solid beer, I would definitely have another, wish I picked up more than a single.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

Great aroma. Very citrusy/grapefruity with some cut grass. Also a slight sweetness in the aroma.

Taste was great as well. Bitter hoppiness nicely balanced by a complementary malty sweetness. This beer tastes good!

Mouthfeel is very smooth. The hops hit first but you get a nicely cleaned palate after each sip.

Overall, this beer goes down far too easily for its high ABV. Be careful! This is also on the expensive side (I paid $3 for a 12 oz bottle) but I wasnt disappointed. A little expensive to drink all the time, but was a very nice treat!","Wake Forest, North Carolina, USA","doppelmeup"

I loved the pine sap in the smell, then the flavor was very sweet in the hops and biig in sweetness with a balanced finish, which is what separates the men from the boys in the Double IPA Category.  Very grapefruity, more so than even 90 Minute, it is almost 120 minute hoppy.  This is an outstanding beer.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
1160,"2008-06-22",4.3,"Had this with some spicy pad thai.  The perfect compliment - a huge bitter beer with loads of character.  Big orange color with a frothy head that dissipates slowly.  The aroma is spicy and strongly citrus sweet.  Like rubbing your nose in a pile of hops.  The flavor is smoothly sweet, and dramatically bitter in the finish.  I detect cereal/bread flavors, roasted toffee flavors.  Very minimal carbonation - its a tight bubble that gives off a suggestion that this might age well.

A huge thank you to dmtroyer for the wonderful gift of this beer.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","can8ianben"
1160,"2008-06-18",4.1,"Great looking beer in the glass with the fluffy white head on top of a deep amber color liquid.  The aroma was wickedly original, I was overwhelmed by something akin to fruit cocktail, pineapple, and an overall smell of sweetness.  The aroma carried over to the tongue as this beer was lip-smackingly tasty.  The only downfall came on the finish when, although I really noticed the hops, this taste was unfortunately lost in an overpowering alcoholic taste.  What could I expect though, this is 10% alcohol.  In conclusion this is yet anoter killer beer from the folks at Bells.  I dont think it needs to be so strong, and this is definitely not a session beer, but undoubtedly the best double IPA I have ever tasted.","Whitmore Lake, Michigan, USA","Dezzilu"

Flavor is sweet malt, honey, grapefruit with the hops coming through strong at the finish with a pleasant lasting bitterness on the tongue.  Perfectly balanced.  Medium body with light carbonation.

1160,"2008-05-28",3.9,"Batch 8278. This Imperial IPA pours a medium copper amber color from a 12oz bottle. Medium sized white foamy head, nice lacing with good retention. The aroma is floral hops with some honey and some orange blossom. A medium bodied Imperial IPA. The malts are fruity and sweet. The hops are floral and grapefruity. Lots of orange blossom flavors. They balance the hop bitterness very nicely. Guess I am too used to west coast double IPAs, but I want a little more hop profile. The mixture works well here, and this is a tasty beer, but if I had to taste it blind I would never guess its a Imperial IPA. A lot of that is due to the fact it hides the 10% alcohol very well. Very drinkable, and if the alcohol was a little lower would be a nice session ale. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

As I pull it away, I noticed it is a little hazy.  This think this is due to a protein haze.  Although, personally, appearance means little to me on beers - it is all about taste - this site forces me to rate this beer low in this category.

I take a another wiff of this beer.  Is is Columbus?  Crystal?  Amarillo?  Or....  did they dry hop with summit?!

I pour a little beer into my mouth.  My brains jumps to memories of a homebrew club meetings in Blacksburg - ""Hop Juice"" and then to Old Dominion double IPA with Summit.

Saying this beer is ""great"" would be an insult.  The hops are balanced through the entire beer.  Not bitter at all.  Just good floral/citrus throughout the taste.  The beer ends with nothing - just a clean freshing fresh taste in the mouth.

Tastes very nice - very sweet indeed, with lots of strong oily astringent hops and just a tad too much alcohol with a citrus life-saver note in the finish. Great carbonation, nice and light frothy body. This is a monster of an IPA in terms of alco-burn, but a bit tamer and better balanced than most when the hops come into play.

The flavor is sweet, slightly sugary, caramel malts, melon and grapefruits with a nice big fruity, peppery hop bite in the finish.  Its a little on the sweet side but this bottle is not quite so fresh.  Ive had it fresher with a bigger hop presence.  The hop bitterness comes out more as it warms.  The alcohol is very well hidden.  The mouthfeel is medium to full with nice velvety carbonation.

Clear golden orangish with moderate white head. Citrusy piney american hops dominate aroma backed with some light malt notes. Flavor is moderatly sweet of light malts and spicey citrusy american hop varieties. Medium mouthfeel with just enough bitterness to ballance out malt sweetness.

A quater inch of white head peaked before deminishing to a skim coat with some streaks and dots of lacework.

1160,"2008-05-01",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2009 Another go at this one, pretty fresh to boot, and Im not as impressed as I once was. Clear red-amber with a nice fizzy white head. Nose has fruit but its sweet, almost no citrus, almost synthetic, and lots of pine. Flavor is very sweet, malty, honey, some mango and banana, a little tea. Palate keeps the un-spritely flavor from sinking, but is too short to earn the 5/5. A little boozy in the finish. Overall decent IIPA, but this is too sweet for hop extremists, lacks the fruit refreshment and palate explosion... RR has fortunately set the bar way high.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

1160,"2008-04-29",4.4,"12 oz. bottle.  Thanks durhambeer!  Pours a rich orange color with a rather fizzy white head.  Aroma is amarillo hops, with the distinctive grapefruit aroma.  The flavor is great!  Starts with the delicious citrusy hops bitterness up front, and moving back it tingles.  As it warms you get juuuuuuust a hint of the sweet maltiness that is characteristic of a barley wine.  I never coulda told you this was 10% abv.

1160,"2008-04-29",4.3,"12 oz bottle: This is a beautiful pour of light orange with white head.  Overwhelming floral and citrus bouquet that gives way to the alcoholic bite youre about to experience.  To say this beer is bitter is an understatement, however, the flavor is there to back it up.  Bright grapefruit overtones, piney undertones, a bitterness punch in the mouth that makes you want more.  All rounds out to a beer that any hophead will love.","I F&ckin hate those guys from, Ohio, USA","Rogueone"
1160,"2008-04-28",4.3,"Pours a hazy coppery orange with a dense white head that shows exceptional retention for beer of this ABV. The slightest swirl of the glass brings the head back quickly.  Floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma. Despite the hop dominance, there is a hint of sweet maltiness underneath.  Starts off with a hoppy bitterness with major grapefruit and orange overtones with a slight pine bite. But that gives way to pleasant sweetness before the crisp fruity hop finish takes over. Very nice and extremely well balanced for having such a hop profile.  Crisp mouthfeel but sill coats your mouth in a prickly hoppy goodness.  I was extremely impressed with the beer. I would definitely put it in the top few DIPAs Ive tasted. This would be a staple in fridge if I had easier access to it.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Pours a golden orange, glowing and beautiful, a nice near-white head that lasts pretty long for the ABV and retains powerful lacing along the sides of my tulip glass. The aroma of this beer is ridiculously nice. Hops all the way; fruity with lots of pear and pineapple, but also herbal the way I love it so, man Im just out there in the experimental garden at the UM botanical gardens some summer in Ann Arbor, drinking deep those herb aromas. Heck, one sniff of this beer and suddenly I remember the whole route out there, out Geddes past Route 23 and left on Dixboro, past the housing developments that were already starting to mar the Michigan countryside....
Beautiful flavor. Perfect balance, no sticky over-roasted grain, just powerful fruity hop goodness, no palate ruinition, just tropical-fruit hops, steeped in honeydew, with slight hints of resin and a smooth mouthfeel that would leave you thinking 7% if it werent for out utter burst of flavor that could not be explained below the 10% that this actually musters. 

Spendid beer; a worthy big brother to my all-time favorite Two Hearted.

Just pure goodness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1160,"2008-04-19",3.8,"Well, lets see what all the hype is about- 12 oz. bottle (Batch 8277) poured into tulip.  Poured transparent dark copper orange, thin white ring around the glass for a head, aroma of citrus and floral hops.  Hits the mouth with a defined medium body, hops are present throughout the tasting and even after swallow, finish is complete, slightly bitter, and has a slight honey note (go figure that one), alcohol is not noticeable at all.  Color me unimpressed- its contemporaries (DFH 120, Averys Maharaja, Stones Ruination) are unique in their own ways, Hopslam seems a bit run of the mill for a double IPA.  Major let down- you can purchase 2 6ers of Two Hearted for nearly the same price as 1 6er of Hopslam back in Michigan when in season.

Absolute sex in a glass.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1160,"2008-04-15",4.7,"Ive been looking for this stuff.  Pours reddish gold, with a perfect white head that diminishes to a little white cap that lasts the whole beer through.  Phenomenal bouquet of hops.  Earthy hops, citrus hops, bright floral hops.  All of that in this one.  Mouthfeel is dead on, not too thin, not cloying.  Lacing is great.  There is a note of the honey sweetness to this, in the aroma and the taste, but it balances out nicely with the hops.  Big alcohol content, but easy to drink.  Could be trouble because it is sooo good, and you want to drink more after you finish a glass.  But due to the rarity of this (especially in an area that cant get it) you have to make sure not to blow through your stash.  I will make this an annual task to get as much as possible when it is available.  Could be my favorite beer Ive had.","Maryville, Tennessee, USA","dolemite77"

OK, maybe balance isnt exactly the word, you would have to be a hophead to enjoy this, but anyway the malt is there if you look for it.  Light carbonation, medium heavy texture, very bitter finish.  True to its name, true to style, but the flavor is a bit one dimensional to me.  Heavy on bitter, but not much complexity.  There are a few other IIPAs I prefer for their taste.  Still, very good beer overall.","San Diego, California, USA","IEBAILI"

Mouthfeel was full, smooth and weighty -- very nice! Carbonation was spot on, too. Malts were were sweet and sticky (caramel, Sugar Daddy candy and honey) but they were tamed by a big, snappy bitterness. Some earthy-yeasty elements. Hops were bold and multi-dimensional (pine, grapefruit, bitter orange, grass). As a hophead, I really enjoyed this one, and it sure does live up to its name!

A little sweeter than some other top tier IIPAs but complimented nicely by a sharp bitter bite.  Still amazing.  Re-rate 1/18/09. This years batch just hit the shelves here so this stuff is fresh. Golden-orange color, moderate head that settles to a thin film and yields some blotchy lacing. Massive hoppy aroma; loads of grapefruit and some pine as well. Huge hoppy flavor, not surprising based on the aroma, and overall this is very tropical; grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, mango. I wouldnt classify it as easy drinking or smooth this go around as this is quite puckery but thats the way it should be. The West Coast rules the hoppy beers but heres an East Coast IIPA that can really compete with those.  Original Rating:  This is one fine beer. Pours a clear light orange color with a medium sized head. A wonderful grapefruit hoppy aroma. The flavor is grapefruit hops with a good amount of sweet fruitiness and maybe some caramel.

Nice alcohol warmth in the finish and a nice, firm mouthfeel.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","allfreej"
1160,"2008-03-30",4.4,"Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a decent, but not exactly rocky head. Aroma was wonderfull piney, citrusy hops. Flavor was full-on but more balanced by sweet malt than the Hop Slam name would imply. Full-bodied, bracing hops flavors abound. This beer is great for the first three quarters of a glass but I found its attributes surprisingly faded for the last portion. Cant explain it. I love hoppy beers and this is a good one. Might have been a fluke. Ill try another bottle tonight. Quality and attention to detail is evident. This is a fine ale made with top-notch ingredients.","Maineville, Ohio, USA","Beer Guy99"
1160,"2008-03-30",4.2,"Pours a cloudy orange, nice two finger head. Taste is citrusy, maybe a touch too sweet, but the nice hop ""slam"" does seem to make up for it. The hoppy aftertaste is quite good. Have several in the fridge to enjoy.","Strongsville, Ohio, USA","BR007"
1160,"2008-03-29",4.1,"Pours orange-amber into the glass, ever-so-slightly hazed, leaving lace from a diminishing froth.  Sweet bouquet of candied fruits and honey... quite nice.  Nothing about the ABV is obvious in this brew.  There starts upfront a sweet malt, with citrus, thin caramel and honey.  The bitters begin mid-palate, and dont squash the mouthfeel.  Well done finish, with bitters mixing with rind zest and a hint of pine.  Maybe the most quaffable higher ABV brews Ive ever had.  Nicely bittered, nothing overdone, and very complex in flavors.  Everything comes together perfectly, integrating for a smooth palate offering.  Bells rings up another winner with this delight!","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

1160,"2008-03-27",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2010 2010 bottle, this years batch is everything I remember from my original rating. grapefruit, a bit more citrus rind, honey, and some mild bitterness. this is soft and gentle but a big beast at the same time. fantastic stuff and the alcohol is so well hidden.

2008 bottle my wife brought back for me when she went on a business trip. thanks wife, she also brought back a few other bells brews and these are the first i have tried. poured into a snifter has lighter carbonation visible and a thin lacing layer of light tan froth and a light ruby amber color. the smell is absolutely heavenly. there is the sweetest  grapefruit hops i have ever smelled mixed in with fresh real honey leaving aromas of grass and wildflower pollen from the fields the bees fly about. light caramel and citrus rinds make the aroma like hops colliding with a candy store. at this point i wish she could have fit cases of the stuff into her suitcase but this one bottle will have to do. the taste is incredibly smooth without any heavy biting from the hops or alcohol really being noticeable. the main attraction is clearly the hops. they are fruited nicely and offer a little pine but dont become resinous. sweetness is at a perfect level and it moves to finish dry with bitter at the side of the tongue. this is just amazing stuff. perhaps because it is rare to get and my wife brought it back for me it tastes even a bit better than it really is.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"
1160,"2008-03-27",3.8,"I have to say firstly that I am not really a hophead- I mean I love hops, but just not usually in the quantity that feels like a 2X4 to the face. There are many over-hopped beers out there, and to me not many of them are very appealing. The Bells hopslam is able to keep the hop flavor fresh, not cooked and overly bitter. Lots of fresh aroma, good tongue covering flavor, no empty spots in the profile. The alcohol is well masked,  just a bit of vapor in the nostrils. I got three bottles, will put the other two down for a while to see where it goes. If you like big beers, this one is a skillfully brewed example that you will really like, not exactly my type of beer, but I can appreciate the quality. Very well done.","Graham, North Carolina, USA","gueuzeisgod"

Wow, this is a great brew.  Only negative is the price.  At over $12 for a 6 pack it is pricy.  The high alcohol content isnt all that noticeable, but probably another reason that this tremendous brew is more for show then its more mainstream cousin the Two Hearted Ale.","Coldwater, Michigan, USA","wmubronco1992"

Hoppiness much more prevalent in the flavor than in the aroma.  The flavor starts with a sweet caramel maltiness and ends with a bitter, herbal hop aftertaste.  Medium bodied, malty mouthfeel.

When I first received this bottle I was a little nervous. With a name like Hopslam I expected it to be overwhelmingly hoppy ( Im not a hophead ). Actually its quite good. Hop flavor isnt over the top & theres a fair amount of malty sweetness. Alcohol is tucked away in the background. I didnt realize I was drinking a 10% brew until I went to rate it. Like I said, quite good.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"
1160,"2008-03-22",3.6,"Draft at Oldsmar Tap House.  Pours a slightly cloudy, deep amber with a pillowy white head.  Aroma full of flowery hops and sweet, doughy malts.  Flavor is fairly hoppy with plenty of citrus and pine character, but this appears to be drowned out by the massive malt bill and ensuing high alcohol content.  Honestly, theres not much here for a hophead to get excited about.  The sweetness is the over-the-top character here.  Pretty good, but I was a bit disappointed.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"
1160,"2008-03-22",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2010 overall impressive beer for high ABV but not over the top bitter.  Pours an orange color with a thick soft head.  Blend of much citrus and pine and the honey adds that mild sweetness that counteracts the pungent hops and high ABV.  Goes down dangerously smooth and quickly.  Good full mouthfeel for an DIPA.  This is my ""desert island"" beer for sure.","Indiana, USA","BigBang"
1160,"2008-03-21",4.4,"Pours a golden color under a small off white head that settles down to a good film over the top. Aroma is interesting. A lot of grapefruit smell with a slightly sweet note that is really good. The obligatory hops piney notes, but mainly a good sweet/sour grapefruit that I really like. Taste is surprisingly mild, not the assault of hops that you come to expect from a West Coast IPA which is a definate change. Very sweet, grapefruity notes with a sweet almost sugary backing to it. A faint alcohol taste to remember it by, but mainly I get a very piney aftertaste that sits on the back of your tongue. Very good, definately deserves its billing.","Appleton, Wisconsin, USA","scoobysnak"
1160,"2008-03-21",4.5,"Many thanks to Acknud for sending along this tasty treat. Pours from the botttle a slightly hazy, but bright orange/copper color under a creamy 1/2"" beige head. Retention is strong throughout the glass with just a few streaks of lacing noted. The intial aromas were big-time essence of Juicy Fruit gum and freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice. This was nicely supported with smells of sun-drenched fresh pine needles, lemon zest, tangerine and some faint sweet honey/floral notes. The 10% alcohol shows up faintly in the aroma serving to amplify the above.  The aromas were basically all about the hops, but whos complaining? Fantastic! Palate was very smooth, silky, creamy with a nicely subtle carbonation.  Flavor was extremely well balanced here between the hops, malts and honey. Yeah, it was definitely dominated by the hops; lots of citrus rind, honey drenched grapefruit and pine. But the late palate delivers a subtle, but balancing presence of orange blossom honey and light crystal malt sweetness. Finishes with a firm hop resin bitterness and a warming alcohol presence. A very easy-drinking big DIPA. As the last swallow is consumed all you can think of is ""Id love to do another!"" A must try for ALL hopheads!","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Head quickly dissapates and ends up being pretty much a little film sitting on the top of the beer.  Aroma is allmost all FRESH hops.  Realy piney, citrusy and freshhhh scent.  It smells bitter, and fresh from the garden/vine.  A little malt also present in the nose.  Taste is a little more well balanced than the aroma suggests.  Good malt backbone to balance the huge hop flavor.  Again taste is distinctively fresh, bitter hops.  Different than many IPAs and IIPAs on that fresh quality.  Aftertaste is suprisingly not better. I was expected a big bitter kick like in the Victory HopWallop but the honey it is apparently brewed with must temper that some.  Alcohol can hardly be detected.  Mouthfeel is nice, its pretty heavy and carbonation is weak.  But it both suits this style well and is what you expect from an IIPA on those fronts.  All in all, a great and suprisingly drinkable IIPA with a great fresh/bitter hop taste.  Too bad it sells out of everywere in about a week.","USA","bpowers"

1160,"2008-03-06",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2009 12oz. bottle into a sniffer.  To me, the aroma was the most outstanding of the Hopslams features.  It smells very fruity, of sweet citrus and even very unique notes of pineapple.  This was all accompanied, of course, by piney hops.  The aroma is not very strong, but it is unbelievably pleasant, unique, and fresh.  It poured a hazy caramel orange with a great soft white head of descent proportion; the head faded quickly unfortunately.  It has an average IIPA palate: medium bodied with a carbonated kick.  However, it was surprisingly smooth.  The 10% abv. is very well hidden beneath the fresh flavor of hops.  At first I was almost disappointed regarding the hops, feeling as if they were not as strong as the name and reputation suggest.  But, the more I drank, the more the hops came alive.  There was still a remarkable balance of malty sweetness, like biting into a tart grapefruit.  Overall, great IIPA.

[RE-RATE]  Bumping the score from 4.1 to 4.4.  Sampled from a bottle again, same great look, same outstanding aroma, and even better flavor than I remember - such nice tart bitting and yet sweet grapefruit.  So balanced.  So NOT overly malty like many IIPAs.  Alcohol hidden so well -- this combined with its soft feel and its outstandingly delicious hop profile makes this beer one of the most dangerously drinkable ones out there.  One of the best in its class.  Serve at cellar temp 50F.  I serve nearly all my beers at this temperature and it truly seems to be the sweet spot for this one,","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"
1160,"2008-03-05",4.2,"This one poured a deep orange color with a medium foamy white head that left a little lacing in the glass. The aroma is of fresh hops, pine, grapefruit, and resin. A really nice fresh smell to this one. The flavor on this one is outstanding. The grapefruit and piney hops come through first but are balanced immediately by a toasty caramel malt background mixed with a touch of honey. The flavor is bold and just gets better with every sip. It has a medium-full body with a smooth finish with some slight hop bitterness on the backend. This one is perfectly balanced and full of flavor. This is easily one of my favorite double IPAs to drink. Bells is where its at.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Medium copper pour, sticky, eggshell-white head with some sticky, clingy lacing. Fresh, bold, strong sprucey aroma, blasting at first with full resins. Mellows and warms after a while to a soft floral-like bouquet. Flavor presents so much more than a citrusy grapefruit bomb that is to be expected at 10%. The bitterness is there but balanced oh so well against a sweet caramelly, nutty back end with a touch of honey. Also detect some nectarines and white grapes. Thick, rich mouthfeel without being tongue-numbing. One of the most weel-balanced 10% abv beers I have ever consumed.

1160,"2008-03-05",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2012 Update:  4 years of palate refinement and a fresh tap pour was a true eye-opener - incredible aroma, oily, clean body, and citrus from beginning to end.  Leaving old comments, but re-rating this beer to give it the credit it deserves... (old rating 3.3).  

Much thanks to Nolankowal for the bottle!  Pours a deep, opaque apricot color with very little head.  Aroma is really intense (Im thinking after one inhalation that there may be some hops in this beer)...Im catching the bulk of the hop aroma being piney and woodsy, with some citrus (grapefruit) hops mixed in there as well, but not getting the citrus hops as the dominant feature like others.  I really enjoyed the aroma on this one...I could sit and sniff this glass all day!  Flavor is all hops...very bitter from start to finish with a bitter aftertaste.  Some malt characteristics are noted mid-drink, but disappear quickly and are replaced by piney hop flavors.  Some orangey/citrusy hop flavors are in there as well.  Unlike others, I did not find this drink to have much of a malt backbone to stand up to the hops, and found the hops overwhelming.  I was expecting this to drink very similar to a Dreadnaught, but the Dreadnaught was leaps and bounds ahead of this beer in terms of drinkability.  Palate is somewhat oily, but not remarkable, and I felt this was an overcarbonated beer.  Alcohol is very notable, although I dont find this to necessarily a bad thing.  Im glad to have tried this beer, but unlike the majority, this is a one-and-done for a non hophead like myself.  Far from my favorite IIPA.  Dare I say my least favorite Bells product other than the Cherry Stout to date?  Blasphemy!","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
1160,"2008-03-05",4.3,"Pours hazy orange.  Never had an aroma quite like it, almost like an apple cider, but with a hint of citrus.  Very balanced, very drinkable. Almost too drinkable at an ABV of 10.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","utopiangator"
1160,"2008-03-05",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2008 Pours a cloudy amber with little head.  Aroma is of PEACHES along with other citrus notes, unrreal.

Flavor is well balanced, alcohol is well hidden by the massive amount of malt and hops.  A great brew from Bells.

7/8/2008 Let one sit for a couple of months and let me say that this beer is heeps better when fresh. I’ve been drinking hopslams off and on since march and I’ve witnessed the degradation of an awesone fresh brew.  This beer is now overly sweet.

This is almost insanely drinkable. After the hops come a little lingering honey chewiness. Pretty good, almost great, but I would rather have a Pliny.

This is pretty drinkable even with a nice biting high ibu count. Body seems drier on bottle with a nice dose of carbonation. A lovely beer altogether so Im sorry for the previos slate even though it still seems a wee bit too fruity.  
Old review: This has to be the most overrated beer at this site. I had it on tap at the Brickskeller, Washington DC. It had a medium body with some resin and citrus but there is this peach-like thing and the malt layer seems to diminish the otherwise high IBU count. I will have to sample this on bottle.

Well, its not uncommon for me to, at times, get to wondering whats so great about IPAs in general.  Every year, this manages to come along and set me straight. So fresh and juicy, so awesome. I upped this rating to a 4.6 last time I rerated it, but its about time to max out the rating scale on this one.

Previous re-rate: Re-rate 1/16/09. 12 oz bottle. Pours slightly hazy amber orange with a nice, fluffy off-white head. Aroma is heavy on grapefruit and floral aromas, with some mild honeylike sweetness. Flavor is great, very strong grapefruit hops, with floral hops and again a moderate sweetness supporting them. A bit of biscuity malts are present to underscore the hops, but this one is all about the hops. The alcohol can be sensed very subtly in the bitter finish. Still puts the other IIPAs Ive had to shame, and as such it unfortunately makes finding a satisfying IIPA all the more difficult by comparison. Ill have to agree with my earlier review, too, that the label illustration is pretty entertaining. 9/5/9/5/18","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"

Poured a semi-traslucent coppery hued orange with a quickly dissipating bone-white head of foam that leaves moderate sticky lacing. Aroma is primarily grassy and floral hop notes, sweet grapefruitiness, caramel malt undertones. Taste is very much of the same, big hoppiness right up front, juicy grapefruit, practically seamless transition into the malty backbone. Leaves a slightly drying lightly bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied brew with lower levels of carbonation, washes down the gullet smooth and easy. Suprisingly well balanced, I had a few of these from last years introductory batch and they seemed hoppier than this. Ovearall an outstanding IIPA at any rate, would highly recommend seeking out.","Geist, Indiana, USA","danielocean03"
1160,"2008-02-17",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2009 Appearance: Pours a translucent, orangey body with a full, foamy white head.

Smell: Wow, they aint kidding. Redolent scent stinking of fresh grapefruit, pineapple, and passion fruit.

Taste: Malts are obscured, perhaps rightly so, by the extreme hoppiness. Tons of intense, juicy fruit hop flavors with a moderate kick of bitterness. The 10% abv is very well hidden. Bittersweet finish with a lingering tropical fruitiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Distinct oily juiciness to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Extremely hoppy, but it still displays a relatively good balance.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1160,"2008-02-17",4.7,"Easily in the top 5 of the best beers Ive ever had. Aroma is of caramel, malt, and grapefruit. Pours a slightly cloudy orange with an off white head that fades except for a thin veil that floats on top. Nice, semi-sticky lacing. The malty foam oozes down the side of the glass after every sip.
Has a creamy texture on the palate. The first few seconds it hits the tongue its actually smooth. Smooth as the prom queens thighs. Then the hops attack your taste buds. A painfully good bitter after-taste leaves you wishing you had bought more of this than you did. 10% alcohol? No way! There is no hint of ethanol to be felt. No burn, no high octane taste. The alcohol content is undetectable. Hopslam is amazing! Made in Comstock, Michigan it is proof that there are some American Brewers that can make excellent beer! The macros should be ashamed that they dont make stuff with this much character and flavor!

1160,"2008-02-17",4.4,"12 oz. bottle.  Wow, have to tip my cap to Bells on this one.  Very close to my ideal beer.  Pours a cloudy orange with a thin lacy head.  First whiff is of orange with a little bit of pine.  Flavor is dominated by a mixture of caramel malts and citrus hoppiness. Body has a creamy texture.  Alcohol is incredibly well hidden, feels as though you could easily finish a six pack of these in a sitting until you realize that it weighs in at 10%.  Finish is smooth with minimal bitterness for a beer with this many hops.  In my humble opinion this beer blows away the two hearted and is the Bells beer of choice for hopheads.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

Unlike the SUPERMEGAMONSTER 3,000,000 IBU HOP beers. this one has balance and you can pick out the complexities of the malt.  Very smooth and easy to drink.  Dont get me wrong, this beer is VERY hoppy.  It just has a good balance and a smooth finish.  The appearance is smooth light mildly cloudy amber and pours with little head.

Nice creamy head (not super enduring though). Its way hoppy, but the nose is a bit stanked at 40-52 deg which put me off a bit. Ill try it again a bit warmer. You can definitely feel the 10% alcohol but its not overly present in the taste.","Leland, Michigan, USA","farlane"

1160,"2008-02-13",4.5,"Perfect pour, if I do say so myself. Beautiful pillowy head. If I could fit my noggin in the glass Id probably lay down on it for a while. Amber color. Aroma = full power. Maybe one of the most pungent beers that Ive encountered. Taste = a bitter, citrusy hop roundhouse to the palate. Absolutely delicious, although the alcohol is a bit more present than in the first three bottles from this sixer (bought a few weeks ago). Scratch that, just the first few sips.  Fairly solid malt balance. An extreme brew for sure, but not too bad considering its 10%. If you drank a sixer of these youd be hopblitearted. ADDENDUM: Raising the overall impression. Probably due to the high alcohol or simple palate habituation, the last third of the beer is absolutely amazing.

Flavor is similar...hoppy, yes, but not just for the sake of hoppiness.  Its a deep hoppiness, with alcohol notes, and some sweetness that makes the beer somewhat reminiscent of a barley wine.

Pours a translucent amber brown with orange edges and a creamy white head that ringed the glass.  The aroma is great, strong hop but not overwhelming; resin, pine, grapefruit, lemon candies, grapes.  The bitter hoppy, citrus flavor rounded out with strong sweetness from the honey they brew with, caramel malts and toffee/caramel flavors.  Finish has some lasting bitterness, but also some lasting sweetness.  Thick and a little syrupy in the mouth and a little salty on the lips and cheeks.  This beer is a lesson in balance.

Ive been picking up a bottle or two whenever I stop in, this is such a delicious hop experience. Sparkling rich copper pour with a thin filmy head, nice lacing, and lively carbonation. Beautiful, bountiful aroma of aggressive American hops. Fresh grapefruit and lemon with pine, pine, and pine. The intense aroma is such an eye opener. Bitter on the palate with a puckering sourness, balance by a thick malty body. The flavor is a fresh explosion of the aroma. Amazing citrus fruits dominated by a strong grapefruit taste. Plenty of evergreen along with oranges and limes. Potent malt backbone, it really ties the hops together. Sharp and floral, this is great stuff.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

The aroma was strong and of hops and grapefruit. The initial taste was of a crisp tart grapefruit, followed immediately by the strong hop bite. The hops bite rolled on the tongue for a long time. A subtle sweetness came through after the initial bitter bite. The sweetness tended to build a little stronger the longer I was drinking making a nice mix between the hoppy bitterness and the honey sweetness. Excellant!!","Florida, USA","gpekar"

1160,"2008-01-31",4.1,"12 ounce bottle, pours a slightly hazy amber with a thick, rich and long-lasting cream-colored head that leaves sticky lacing.  Aroma on pour is all sticky, resiny hops, with lots of pine, citrus (grapefruit) and floral character along with a dollop of sweet honey. Delicious fresh flavor and surprisingly balanced for such an obvious hop showcase.  Totally hop dominated (with just a touch of pale malts), but not overbearing or astringent.  Again, a bit of honey sweetness underneath it all. Palate is full and syrupy, with moderate fine carbonation.  Excellent hopbomb.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","surffisher"

1160,"2008-01-31",4.5,"Pours a lightly hazy orange with a sizable, creamy, off-white head that leaves patchy lace sliding down the sides of the snifter. The aroma is huge, and the name is certainly appropriate. As soon as the cap left the bottle, I could smell big citric hops. In the glass, the aroma is both sweet and bitter with notes of grapefruit, blood orange, light caramel, simple sugar and faint resin. Medium-bodied and quite slick with a transition to a tongue-squeezing, bitter and resinous finish. The flavor is sweet and malty up front with a fluid transition to pink grapefruit (with sugar sprinkled on top) and tight, resinous hops at the swallow. Both the hops and the sweetness linger for quite some time. For a beer packing 10% ABV and sporting a name like ""Hopslam"", I was pleasantly surprised to find a brew that is amazingly well balanced and supremely drinkable. I now understand why this beer never lasts more than a day or two on the shelves each year. If Bells ever decided to make this a year-round brew, it would be a permanent fixture in my refrigerator.

The aroma of the beer was surprisingly sweet.  It was made up of huge, sweet grapefruit, mango, and orange, sweet honey, along with a hint of caramel sneaking in.  The flavor consisted of moderately bitter grapefruit rind, sweet honey, ripe mango, and fresh pine needles.  The sweetness of the honey along with the freshness of the hops made an amazing combonation.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and slightly resiny with very mild carbonation.

First smell encompassed by hops & citrus.  The first sip knocks you back, but sort of soothes as covers the whole palette. Tastes mostly as it smells, with a hint of honey/sweetness at the end.

1160,"2008-01-28",4.0,"12oz.  My bottle was clear orange (I didnt think bells filtered!) with a white/orange head.  Aroma is pretty strong especially as it warms, mostly grass, sweetness and bitter citrus.  Flavor is extremely hoppy with bitter fruit, great acid and pine from the hops.  Mouthfeel is the winner of this offering with a really interesting viscosity that coats the palate partnered with soft carbonation.  Very good, but a bit of a disappointment and lacks the complexity for me to consider it excellent.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","dmtroyer"

The aroma is very hoppy, as the name would imply, with grapefruit, pine, juniper, and some sweet caramel.  The flavor is very hoppy, so much so, that you can’t really taste the malt at all.  There is a little burn in the hops at the end, that says ""you’re going to need tums tonight!""  I do get a faint but of caramel in between the pine, citrus, and grapefruit.

This beer really ""hopslams"" your palate if you hold it in your mouth for long if that makes any sense.  Its hard to believe this is 10% as the alcohol is not apparent in the least.

The hops then kick you in the teeth.  Finish is clean and refreshing, like the first signs of spring after a Minnesota winter.  This beer is definately something you can sink your remaining teeth into.  Just be careful, the 10% alcohol has a tendency to sneak up on you.  This is one of my favorite beers, IPA or not.

The alcohol is entirely unapparent and a 12 oz bottle leaves me wanting more. Very deserving of its high rating.

Aroma is spectacular; grapefruits and citrus out the ass. Hoppy as hell, incredibly vacuous and worthy of its own praise. Crazy good. Flavor is delectable: spicy hops and pleasant citrus interwoven with honey and ginger. Thick and syrupy, but with a nice watery and easy finish. Way too drinkable at 10%, but I feel overall its not as striking of an IPA as Bells own Two Hearted Ale.

The aroma is of pinched orange rind, grapefruit, some spring pine all fresh and sunny like.  The flavor is very balanced.  It is so balanced in fact that it is extreme balance, if there ever was such a term.  The honey malt is the first wave, to be followed by peach notes.  In the end, you get a very nice hop show, but one that is not anywhere near over the top.  It does not linger and finishes clean.  The alcohol is nowhere to be found.

Dense amber orange with a nice fluffy white head.  Hints of floral hops up front - subtle at first.

Theres a good dose of bitterness balanced well with a malt backbone that adds a subtle sweetness of light toffee and honey.

Pours out like glowing honey.  Nice and thick and orange with a slow forming 1 inch head. 

The aroma hits you immediately with a pungent grapefruit, peach, pine, orange combo that assaults your sense of smell.  My mouth is watering just smelling this beer.  The full frontal hop attack that this brew puts on you is countered nicely by a smooth malty backbone.  It isnt balanced but thats ok.  Sharp biting grapefruit, peach, and orange tastes that overpower you and I immediately know that this is the IIPA that I have been looking for.  Now, Ive had Dreadnaught and it is special, but this easily holds its own all the way.  I have a bomber of Dread that I may have to side by side with this.  One other thing.  Dont go thinking you can session this because that 10% will put that ass in a sling.  You dont notice it until its too late.  Awesome beer, awesome brewer.  Got a case of this so I should be in hop heaven for a while....","Huron, Tennessee, USA","Tilley4"
1160,"2008-01-21",4.4,"Thanks foureyedgeek for splitting the case. Shhh.. dont tell my friends. I liked this Double IPA. I wouldnt want them to know, because theyd never let me live it down. Here he is - the Anti-IPA, the hop hater - loving this perfectly crafted beer. Ripe peaches and grapefruits abound the nose, with a rich honey background and subtle caramel malts. The taste is again, predominately peaches and grapefruits, with oranges and lemons abounding. Quite fruity, and very sweet, with honey notes underlying. A strong bitter aftertaste mixed with a gentle, warming sensation in the chest makes this a fantastic sipping brew. What I like about this one - balance. Its key. Sure this is hoppy as all get out, but its got the balls in the background to support it. A hoppy beer without a firm malt background is like a squealing ass guitar solo with out any rhythm instruments - not pleasant, not enjoyable, and most of all.. not necessary. This one, on the other hands, stands out above the crowd for me. The addition of honey was perfect. Best IPA Ive had in a long time.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","santos999"

Color is orange orange orange and smooth as can be, with a thin and frothy head. Taste is almost all hops, hops, and nothing but hops. Some bitterness and orange flavor come through. Thicker than you expect, it rolls into your mouth more like a thinner stout than an IPA. Very sweet and creamy, with a lot of flavor. Hides the alcohol well...Id have never guessed this was 10%.","Indiana, USA","StFun"
1160,"2008-01-21",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2009 Bottle courtesy of jsquire.  Thanks for the awesome bonus!!
Pours a gorgeous cloudy glowing thick orange with an offwhite head that stuck around for a bit.  Bottle is a year old at least, so not sure how much hops have faded, but the smell is more caramelly and of orange with lighter hop backing in the nose, but still nice.  Sweet hopped flavor, and the bitterness is somewhat restrained.  The flavor is fruity, orange, caramel and a touch of alcohol, and the body is rich and thick, but with prickly carbonation, making for an outstanding mouthfeel.  Extremely drinkable DIPA, and one I look forward to trying fresh.  Great beer!

Rerate of fresh bottle.  Much more vibrant hop character, obviously, along with big fruity bittersweet apricot and floral flavors.  Still very drinkable, and brimming with flavor, but alcohol is a bit noticeable.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

1160,"2008-01-20",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2008 Had on draft at the Brew Kettle. Truly had no desire to try this. Not a fan of Hops, and as the name suggests, I assumed there would be lots of them in here. Then a little birdie told me I should try it. That it would be a great beer to make a hop lover out of me. I was powerless to deny this. So I ordered. The smell was overwhelmingly hoppish. And nothing else. So I was NOT expecting to like this and was fully prepared to toss the damn thing. Much to my amusement and delight, this was actually a very good beer! Very smooth, and contrary to the smell, the hops were blended so well, that they actually complemented the whole drink. Taste was sweet oranges and hops. And overall, my little birdie was right.I will have more of this to see if I too can become a hop head.","Pickerington, Ohio, USA","BeerVirgin72"
1160,"2008-01-20",4.1,"12 oz bottle.  Pours golden orange with a 1 cm off white head that is mostly diminishing.  Aroma is brutally strong, piney and a little citrus.  Initial flavor is balanced between the sweet malts and hugely bitter hops.  Flavor of grapefruit is what i get the most of.  Aftertaste is very dry from all the hops.  Light to medium mouthfeel, almost no lacing, almost no carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden.  Very drinkable if you are a hophead, but for the rest of us its still worth a try.","Boardman, Ohio, USA","joekfsu"

Massive Honey presence. Its everywhere, on the start and in the swallow, but the smell is ALL hops. Not even hops; it smells like you stuck your face in a lawnmower bag and inhaled the sticky fresh cut grass. Ive never smelt better things from a beverage. The hops are extremely plentiful in taste but are only mediately aggressive, so its like eating a hop-flavored pound cake instead of an over spiced rum cake, if that analogy makes sense. Full bodied like a bears furry chest. Wonderful beer, best IIpa Ive had yet.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"
1160,"2008-01-18",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2014 [Bottle] Pours orange-golden with creamy light tan head. Aroma is really hoppy--citrusy and grassy. Taste is surprisingly sweet with, as Guerde pointed out, a lot of tangerine. Medium mouthfeel. Although the score may not reflect it, I found the taste to be just slightly better than the aroma, but still, a great IIPA. Old rating: 9/4/9/4/17.Re-rate: [On-tap at Stub & Herbs] Still has a big blast of tangerine, but this 11 batch is not nearly as good as others I have had. The honey sweetness was just overpowering, and made it difficult to finish. I would only rate this in the 3.5-3.6 range, so I will bump the old rating down to somewhere in the middle. Re-rate:  [Bottle from recent batch, consumed January, 2014]  My second rating is definitely more in-line what I experienced this time with the beer.  While it was not offensive in any way, it really just did not impress, and I will not be buying it again any time soon. Lowering rating to mid 3s.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

1160,"2008-01-17",3.9,"Batch 8283.  Pours a surprisingly clear, dark golden/orange with a medium sized white head that quickly recedes to a rim of bubbles around the edge.  I can smell the fruity hops while pouring.  Aroma is hoppy as hell.  Syrupy, sweet, sticky hops.  Hard to pinpoint specifc aromas the hops are giving off - I dont particularly get any citrus or pine and no fruits jump to mind, its just hoppy.  Maybe some grapefruit. The aroma reminds me of a super fresh DFH 90 minute or perhaps Ports Hop 15.  Flavor is big time grapefruit, hoppy, leafy, sweet, only moderately bitter (for the style), with a tingly sensation on the tongue.  Theres a hint in the aroma that this might be cloyingly sweet but thankfully that is not the case.  Bells is probably my favorite brewery and I had very high hopes for this beer and I think I was letdown a little bit.  It is still excellent just not mindblowing in the same way a fresh Dreadnaught or Summer Yulesmith is.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
1160,"2008-01-16",3.5,"Pours deep orange with a fully receding foamy off-white head. Aroma of oranges, grapefruit, and tangerine. Tastes of orange juice, resinous citric hops, bitter acids. Mouthfeel is full bodied, resinous with moderate carbonation. I love Bells, and I am admittedly not a hophead, but this certainly is unique. Even though I really didn’t enjoy this beer, good job Bells. I would like to cellar this beer, just to see what remains after a few years.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
1160,"2008-01-14",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2010 Pours a cloudy medium orange-amber-gold with a thin, fine white head which is quite beautiful. The aroma is dominated by candied orange peel with primarily sweet but also dry malt notes alongside some alcohol characteristics.  Dense, heavy bitterness in the flavor which is, of couse, dominated by hops and comes across as indistinct herbal/vegetal and not particularly piney or citrusy.  This is a ""darker"" hop profile  which is well-served by the sophisticated malt aspects.  Despite the sweetness in the nose, the robust malt flavor is quite dry in the mid-palate with only a small amount of sweetness up front and in the finish.  A high alcohol component is evident as expected, and is well integrated into the body.  The finish is long and bitter with quite a bit of alcohol warmth.  The overall balance of the beer is very good while conveying an extreme amount of biterness alongside a lot of alcohol.  Kudos to bells for a well-poised ""bruiser.""","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Yes, the hops are everywhere in this beer, but the sweet malts balance it out well. Nothing is out of proportion. The hops dont bury the beer as the label would imply.

According to the BJCP, slight haziness is allowable if it is dry hopped, but this is a bit more than that. It doesnt seem to clear with time either. There is a huge hop bouquet even from a distance. Very strong citrus aromas, especially grapefruit, but slightly more bitter. The flavor is amazing though. It is not nearly as bitter as the flavor would have led me to believe. It is a dead ringer for actual grapefruit flavoring. The bitterness is only in the background, and there is enough sweetness to back it up. This is a great example of an Imperial IPA (except the cloudiness); perhaps one of the best ive had.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

12oz bottle. Batch #8277. Much fresher this time. Nose similar, much hoppier but I dont know if I could call it better. Smelled fantastic both ways, just depends on what kind of IPA or IIPA you like. Flavor is a huge difference, and this is definitely for the better. The aged bottle surprisingly didnt lose a ton, but this is almost a different animal. It goes from a super hopped IPA to a massively hopped IIPA, if that makes sense. In the grand scheme of things thats a big difference, at least ot my palate. Have to up the flavor 1 point, the overall 2 points. 

12oz bottle courtesy of moejuck. Batch #7690, packaged on 10/25/2006, so its exactly one year old as of today. Should be interesting. Pours a golden copper colored body with a 1.5 finger thick white head. Very pillowy. Lacing coats the sides of the glass, and packs of foamy bubbles hang out on top of the beer for quite a while. A nice looking head is easily resurrected with a few swirls of the glass. Still smells pretty damn hoppy after all this time, but with a definite big caramel malt backbone. Also has notes of pine cones, grapefruit, phenols, oranges and grassy fields. Hop bite and bitterness is noticeable right away on the fore. Caramel sweetness blends in, followed by a pretty big blast of grapefruit hops, then some nice grassy/pine notes.Oily slick mouthfeel, medium bodied, very nice for the style. Finish is loaded with hops and sweet caramel, pretty lengthy as well. Will have to try again when it comes out next year, but this is very good even at this late stage.

1160,"2007-10-09",4.2,"Thanks to illinismitty for the trade.  Bottle into pint.  Big fluffy but firm beige head, dissipates rockily.  Orange and murky in the glass with a yeasty nebula suspended on top.  Smells of leafy, flowery hops with a light soapiness, graham cracker malts, and some black pepper; delicious.  Taste starts with a piney bite, the hops being earthy and dirty in their bitterness, and the pepper being very apparent on the finish.  Medium bodied with some sliding unfermented sugars gliding over the top.  Finish is slightly dry, very earthy, the bitterness balanced by a musty almost yeasty quality; it lasts forever, eventually fading into softness (meaning that the husky mustiness that is all the way through the beer is the only thing left in your mouth at the end).  Lace is not sticky, sliding suds on the side of the glass.  As the beer warms, you can pick up a little alcohol in the nose.  While the prime character of the hops in this is musty and earthy, there is an ever-present fresh grapefruit flavor lurking underneath, which intensifies as the beer warms, which makes this a wonderful chameleon of a hoppy monster.  In the end, seems just a bit muddled, not as clear as something like Yulesmith (which is the best hoppy beer Ive ever had, so thats not much of a criticism).

It literally smells like a freshly squeezed Florida navel orange was infused with melted toffee and hops.  The flavor just expands upon the world-class aroma.  Citrus hops explode into the mouth like a tsunami, while ample caramel and toffee malts follow behind to quickly and carefully put the taste buds back into check.  Long, pleasing, citrus hoppy finish.  The body is on the heavy side of medium and is somewhat sticky, though I am more than willing to overlook this minor flaw.  What an absolutely fantastic beer!

1160,"2007-08-03",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2008 This might be my dissapointment of the year come award season in december.  I was expecting something truly stunning.  Something that would tingle my buds with that hop explosion I thought was promised.   Instead I had a funky hop malt combo that was really a dulled down experience.  Maybe a fresh one would suit me better, maybe.  It improved as I sat and sipped, but from a 2.5 to a 2.9.        
Rerate- Fresh bottle and damn thats good.  Now I see why people are buying it buy the case in bunches.  I honestly could have just sat there and consumed 3,4, 5 bottles of this.

Nice strong hop aroma on the pour, but fades to very mild long-boil malty caramel honey notes.  I taste a mellow, well blended hop-malt infusion.   Heavy body.

Poured a murky off-orange in color. I noticed some sediment in the bottom of the bottle but a bit snuck past my careful pour and hung in the beer. Thin head resting on top. Nose is malty with just a slight hop tang that belies what lies underneath.

Flavor is perfectly balanced. Hops are fruity and citrus. Like biting into a ripe orange. The first sip grabbed my attention. Malts never rise to the top but are consistently present throughout each sip providing a perfect balance. Hop oils linger around the edges of the tongue. Mouthfeel is a bit watery but concealed well behind all the hops. A nice beer to enjoy a bottle or two at a time because after a couple my tongue would get numb.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","muddyfeet"

Upon pouring this viscous hazy golden liquid, the area surrounding the glass was blown up with massive earthy hops aroma....a very good sign.  Minimal head, but this brews heavy malt and grapefruit aroma is intense! Tons of tree sap flavor with more citrus/grapefruit that ends in a serious hop profile.

1160,"2007-06-26",4.0,"Found a cold bottle of this at Marthas Vineyard-a bit of a surprise this time of year and something that I was looking to try. 

Smelled great right after opening the bottle and poured with a great strong scent into the pint glass. Didnt pour as murky as I thought that it would be but rather a orange gold with a white 2-finger head with large bubbles. Some sweet floral hints along with the strong hops arose after the pour-my taste buds were watering by then.

The hops are the most evident tastes to me and they are pretty consistent throughout. The floral hints I smelled early definitely come through in the beer too-and there is carbonation throughout as well. There seems to be a alcohol taste at the end of each sip-not quite to my liking really as I think that my tongue is a bit numb now. 

I think that that this beer definitely is hoppy enough for me, perhaps a bit too much for my liking. I will definitely try it again if it comes my way, but I dont think that I would be able to handle more than a couple in one session.","Dublin, IRELAND","jspruit"

The pour alone looks like this beer is a simple malt canvas on which a gorgeous work of hop is painted. The nose is punching me in the face, resinous, grapefruit, all kinds of fruit and citrus, mildly piney and spicy, almost sweet.

This is great, and very tasty as Id expected.

1160,"2007-05-29",3.9,"12 oz bottle (Batch 7806)
Ive been saving this for a while and finally decided to open it.  After all, it was unlikely to become more of a hopbomb with aging.  It had been stored in the fridge as long as I have held the bottle which has been about two months now.  My palate might be adjusting because this was not as intense as I thought it would be from the description.  Still, it certainly earns the category of double/imperial IPA without a doubt.
Aroma / Appearance - A coppery translucent body is decorated by a three-quarters finger height head.  The thick lacing clings to the sides as if to indicate the levels at which the sips were taken.  The nose of caramel, resin, grapefrui, orange and chocolate liquer reminds me of a young barleywine.  It was very inviting; I could smell this one for fifteen minutes or more before my nose would burn out.
Flavor / Palate - The thick mouthfeel clings to the throat and tongue as the flavors unfold on the eager senses.  Creamy caramel, vanilla, malts and the base bitterness create a rich complexity.  The resinous grapefruit aftertaste intensifies over the course of the bottle until by the last sip it is pure hops.  However, at no point is it so strong as to overwhelm the palate - it has a nice balance to it which makes it all the more enjoyable.  It would be nice to put this side by side with a Ruination and see how they compare.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Hopslam is one of those beers you can smell from a couple feet away when its opened. Pure fruitiness. Poured this into a snifter upon opening and got myself a semi-clear copper colored hop-bomb. Not much head to speak of and theres a huge amount of floating particles. Im guessing proteins. This is my fourth bottle from this 6-pack and the first two I dont remember seeing this but the last one I did. I also remember better heads but this one just wasnt there. Maybe a little too cold? Big and little carbonation bubbles rising from random points throughout. The head there is does leave small drink history lines though. The particles and lack of head hurt the appearence of this beer. 

The smell does make up for the lack of appearence. Starts with big juicy pineapple and grapefruit. I can just picture them squeezing the juice into each bottle. Maybe thats where the particles came from, pulp. Anyways, There is even a nice spattering of pine oil. The pine comes through after all the fruit juiciness. Theres the smallest amount of malt and booze coming through but the hops knock it all back. One of the beers that will make your mouth water.

Big hop bitterness. Just the way I like things. The fruitiness in the flavor leans more toward the grapefruit side. Sweetened grapfruit but with the bittering effects of unsweetened. There is a caramel malt backbone that tames things down slightly but stays where it should, in the back. The pine needle hoppiness comes back a little on the finish but its accompanied by a slightly astringent alcohol bite that dries things out. This is something else I dont remember from the first couple bottles but was more evident in the last. Not bad but does detract slightly from the flavor.

The mouthfeel is really well done on Hopslam. Its medium bodied and in no way viscous like many other IIPAs. The pure hoppiness gives a pleasant numbing effect on the tongue and lips. Leaves a decent coating as it slides through.

This is one to sit down and sip but the sipping could last quite awhile. tastes good with a nice body to sit and enjoy a couple at a time. Just watch out for the abv.

This is a quality made beer and another winner from Bells. Like I said throughout the review the first couple bottles from the 6-pack were better in almost every aspect. I picked this up about two weeks ago and its been in the fridge so aging shouldnt be it. I still really enjoy this but the first couple bottles were exceptional. I still think the price is solid for such a nicely made beer and that it was available in Illinois.

1160,"2007-04-25",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2008 Very nice! And a good example of how a beer can be big on hops and still leave room for malt to do its thing. The aroma was generally dominated by citric hops: orange rind, lemon rind, and grapefruit juice, and then a touch of doughy biscuity malt in the background. The flavor equally hoppy, it was a spicy resiny sort of hoppiness, with a mangoish level of fruitiness. Again, malt was there like biscuits or sugar cookies, providing plenty of rounded oomph to fill out the palate. Golden colored with a nice full creamy head. 
Draft @ redlight. Woot woot!! Thats some stinky dank hop aroma!! Oh it makes me feel so good. Piney resiny grapefruit and dank cannabis. This is some deep hop aroma. Faded copper color, poured with minimal head. I dont even want to drink it, jsut sniff it. But of course Im going to drink it and I dont even know where to begin. I get a big grapefruit citrus plus white grapes and cantaloupe or honeydew. Lingering resinous hops are sweaty and citric with a lemon-lime rind, the longer lingering fruit is honeydew rind. Malts? Oh shit I almost forgot about malts! ummm, bready with a syrupy caramel sauce but theyre not  heavy. Not so much a backbone to the hops but a torso. Not a headless limbless torso but simple nonetheless. What the hell am I talking about?! I think metaphors have gone out the window of a speeding pickup truck. Make that a big truck with rust around the wheel wells. Back to the beer, the hops get puckering in the citrusickness. This beer just made me make up a word. This beer might also cause dissociative disorder. Im not even halway through my pint. I think Im fucked. Woooooooooy. From a distance (what distance?) I think theres some kind of candy-caramel nearby. Ive lost my ability to manipulate a writing instrument. That means pen. Theres a girl at the bar that looks like a young Linda Rondstadt circa 1968, and shes just ordered a pint of this stuff. A beer geek couldnt hardly ask for a better infatuation.

The hops are spot on as a wonderful compliment to this fruit flavor that you just cant (and dont want to) get over.

While I agree with many of the reviews that the malt backbone is nice...make no mistake, the hops dominate this brew in every aspect. I think 70ibus is a tad on the low side.

Pours a hazy bright orange with a fluffy two finger head that fades slowly to a thick cap. tha lacing is very sticky, as you would expect from a very hoppy beer.

Smell; initially this is on the floral side, but then a ton of citric aromas come wafting out of the glass, with grapefruit, oranges and lemons. I can also can detect a nice sweet malty backbone, that should help offset those hops.

Taste; as with the smell this starts out floral on the first couple of sips. Then the citrus dominates with the oranges, grapefruits and just a touch of lemon thrown in. The malts are definitely there, and provide a sweet undercurrent to the hops. On the finish I can feel the alcohol a bit in my nose, and a bit in my throat, but it never becomes distracting.

Mouthfeel is a touch on the ful side, and the drinkability on this is just incredible. I could drink a few of these without feeling completely pummeled by the hops, but I think the alcohol would definitely knock me out.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

Feels like sticking your nose into a handful of fresh picked hops.  The flavor is very nice and smooth.  Despite being powerfully lemony with hop citrus delicousness, there is something about it that balances out the exptectedly rough hop character.

1160,"2007-04-03",4.4,"Bottle, batch 7775.  Pours amber orange with a average size creamy white head.  The lacing leaves a film on the whole glass that stays from the top all the way down to the bottom.  The head sticks around too.  The aroma is of citrus fruits.  The first taste reveals some roasted malts, but this beer doesnt play around the hops.  Very heavly hopped.  Pine and citrus hops, grapefruit, orange and lemon.  It is fruity too, I am tasteing some pear, peach and pineapple.  When you first taste this one it is very sweet and very bitter, then the sweetness falls back but the fruity bitterness still is very heavy.  The body is medium to full with a creamy texture with lively carbonation.  For a beer this creamy and smooth it is carbed a little high.  I wish Bells would make this one a mainstay instead of a seasonal.  I prefer this one over there Two Hearted Ale, but it is about 5 or 6$ more per 6 pack.","Hamilton, Michigan, USA","biggenius29"

You get that big grapefruit in the taste as well, with the alcohol presentng itself up front and in your face.  Kind of bitter finish, a little tart, but satisfying.

If I had been thinking, which I wasnt after running 6.2 miles, I would have told Maniac and Starfireming we were going.  Oh well.  Hey Maniac, they had this on tap again!  Medium orange, decent fine head.  Aroma was hop focused, mostly grapefruit with a touch of pine.  Some gummy malts hold it all together nicely, biscuit flavors barely emerging, while the focus remains squarely on a standard hop offering of grapefruit, pine, and a touch of pineapple.  Nice stuff here.  RERATE:  2/9/11 of the now painfully hard to find and rare Hopslam.  Not quite as drinkable as it used to be, hops are touch more abrasive, alcohol a bit more present, but still a really good beer.

Comments: A rather confusing offering from Bells. Dynamic hop aromas range from the herbal character from noble hops while direct, punchy mandarine/tangerine nuances strongly hint at Amarillo Americanised hops. All the while, the body remains kinda smallish, a bit oily and leaving room for residual sugars  a bit like I would expect an Stone IPA and kinda failing to provide the usual roundness and nourishment I associate with a Bells.

1160,"2007-03-27",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
A bursting hop perfume shields the nostrils and tastebuds from most of lifes inanities. Resinous miracles, citrusy authenticity, and wooden wisdom ride the lean biscuity maltiness for a highly invigorating Imperial IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the clear honeyed golden.
-The hop profile is definitely reminiscent of Dreadnaughts, which I adore, but its malt character is drier and less developed, focusing on quenching, whereas Dreadnaught would be chewy and crunchy (in my book).
-Its bubbly presence helps alleviate the bracing wooden, resinous hop bitterness.

Hops come out in a very citrusy fashion with strong herbal, maryjane notes. Lots of definition on this nose, very spicy but not biting. The flavor is not all the bitter, but filled with grapefruit and lemon. Malts are medium sticky and balance things out quite well.

Bottle split with Tronraner. Man, Hopslam destroys. There is a ridiculous amount of fresh, herbal, citrusy hop quality in the aroma. Deep, spicy pine, grapefruit, ganja. The whole nine yards. Mouthfeel is sticky with loads more hop devastation and a smooth, malt presence to balance out things. Perfectly clean and deep.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1160,"2007-03-18",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2008 Pours a slightly hazy amber color with decent white head.  Aroma is of rich ctrus notes which dominated my nose along with a faint nose of alcohol that lets you know that its an IIPA.   Taste is extremely citrusy with a lot of orange coming through.  A hint of nectarine in the finish as well as some caramel malt.  Mouthfeel is very resinous and oily.  Nice sheets of lacing as the beer is consumed.  A very solid IIPA!","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"
1160,"2007-03-18",4.2,"golden body, big fluffy white head that faded down pretty quickly.  nose is hops ontop of hops ontop of hops, with some hops mixed in, and a hint of citrus. there was almost so much bitter hoppiness that it was sweet.  flavor was just massive doses of hops, some flowerly lightness to the front end, but the back was a slick oliy bitterness that was just short of being overwhelming. the fact that is did come up short is actually what makes it so good...it seems that they found the perfect balance of enough malts to keep the hops in check, but still keep them almost invisible in the flavor...this is everything an IIPA should be.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
1160,"2007-03-18",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2007 Pours out a nice deep golden yellow color with a medium beige head.  Aroma was exremely hoppy with nice hints of grapefruit and some slight sweetness.

1160,"2007-03-17",4.1,"Bottled sample via Oakbluff on IIPA Saturday. Light amber in colour with medium carbonation. Huge hop aroma with notes of Centennial hops (orange/grapefruit), cut grass, and a bit of sweet tropical fruit. In the mouth, this beer is still all about the hops with loads of citric and light tropical flavors. Some sweetness is present as well, but the beer is not overly malty. Good drying bitterness. Great stuff!","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1160,"2007-03-17",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2007 Bottled at Oliver Twist, Stockholm.  Pale amber, no head. Enormously powerful lychee-like hop aroma. Fairly sweet wih its of caramelly maltto balance out the massive hop content, Like hop juice, but pleasantly soft, weaving a cottony fabric of hops around my tongue. Despite everything it still feels nicely drinkable. Very American and very good. One of the most aromatic beers ever.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1160,"2007-03-17",4.5,"Ive been buying this in damn near every mixed six pack Ive bought at the liquor store since it was released (one of the joys of living in Michigan - Bells is easy to come by).  Hands down one of my favorite beers. Beautifully hoppy. Sweet aroma. Hop bitterness and flavor without overpowering the malt. I cant seem to speak highly enough about this beer. If you like IPAs, try this. And if you like Bells Two Hearted, this blows it out of the water.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","IanWalker"
1160,"2007-03-14",4.0,"Bottle from trade with Shigadeyo. Thanks Craig! (Batch 7690) Poured a clear copper with a creamy off-white head that leaves light lacing.

1160,"2007-03-13",3.7,"Sampled at the O-Town throwdown. Pours murky brown with lasting off white head. It has a full grapefruit hop aroma. The flavor follows suit with grapefruit juice hoppiness with hints of sweet malts in the background.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1160,"2007-03-11",3.9,"12 oz bottle purchased at Johns Grocery in Iowa City, IA. Poured a clear dark golden/light orange color. Head was white with good retention and lacing. Pungent hop aroma with grapefruit, pine resin, grass, and dried leaf elements. There is also a hint of white wine. The grapefruit nose dominates after warming up a bit. Distinct citrusy grapefruit flavor with relatively modest hop bitterness. There is also a touch of lemon and tangible alcohol, again making the beer somewhat reminiscent of white wine. This stuff must be unbelievable on tap.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

1160,"2007-03-10",3.8,"bottle at Dickinsonbeers on 1/20/07.  cloudy golden color, off-white thick foamy head.  aroma is cat piss, armpit sweat, and pine needles.  flavor is sweet white sugar malt and lots of bitter hop, bitter finish.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","MullMan"
1160,"2007-03-10",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2008 My top beer of 2007! Bottle from trade with kmweaver. Cloudy light orange-brown. Big fruity, juicy hop aroma with a hint of bubblegum. Flavour is perfect for everything its not. Its not syrupy. Its not a BW with lots of hops. The alcohol is very restrained. Just delicious fruity hop juice. Maybe its where my palate is but my tongue survived un-bruised.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
1160,"2007-03-09",4.5,"Bottle in a trade from pantanap-- thanks!!  Pours a classic orangey color, pretty hazy but not overly so, khaki head that dissipated quickly except for penumbra on the glass.  Lots of citrus (especially pineapple) hop aroma with more grass and pine than the west coast hop bombs Im used to.  Sweet up front, tangy grapefruit hops with almost no malt, tingly finish, hidden alcohol.  Quite understated despite everything.","","brstp"
1160,"2007-03-09",4.2,"Get the yeast in there...waste not, want not.  It really rounds out the smoothness... and the protein is good for you.  Barely noticable caramel malt taste; A sprucey/piney aroma, strong hops flavor, yet remarkably smooth after taste...usually.  Have noticed between different 6-packs some inconsistancies as far as overall flavor...never really bad, but some better than others.  Some have more apparent alcohol taste than others.  Either way, holds a nice head all the way down.  Would recommend a large snifter for moderate drinking....Ha Ha Ha

1160,"2007-03-09",4.2,"Bottle.  Very nice aroma of hops, citrus, pineapple, and pine.  Flavor is initially sweet but then become bitter and malty (a lot of malt, kind of like barleywine).  Good beer.","San Mateo, California, USA","golubj"

1160,"2007-03-09",3.9,"From a bottle. I bought this one at Johns Grocery in Iowa City. It is great to see the big Bells beers in Iowa. A slightly yellowish and long lasting head tops a dark gold and orange body. The aroma is fresh hops with pineapple and mango. Lots of tropical fruit. There is also some nice amaretto behind that initial hop pungence. The initial taste is massive pineapple and grapefruit, but not quite that sweet. In the back of the mouth, you get notes of brown sugar and almonds. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, yet this is easy to drink. A very well made and relatively balanced IIPA.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1160,"2007-03-08",4.1,"Bottle.  Bottle opens to a pungent pineapple citrus aroma with a light hint of maltiness.  Color is bright orange with a frothy tan head.  Flavor is strong grapefruit hops but not too overbearing and evens out on the finish to a mellower malt balanced bitterness. Palate is lightly creamy and rich with good carbonation.  Fairly straight forward and well balanced beer featuring a strong citrus flavor.","Coralville, Iowa, USA","marchcow"
1160,"2007-03-08",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2008 Re-rate...Batch 8225 or something similar...Pours a nice coppery hue. Aroma is overwhelmingly pleasant, with some citrus, piney, and earthy notes pleasant. Im guessing several types of hops were used here, with a surplus being put on the aromatic hops. The flavor is really not balanced all that well, but judging by the name of this beer Im guessing that was Bells intention. The hop flavor profile seems to lean on the citric side, and it isnt nearly as imposing as I anticipated, which is not a bad thing here. I wouldnt guess this was any where near 10%. The malt profile doesnt really come through well, and I taste honey more than malts. Im also guessing the honey is what bumps this up to 10%. All in all, this is good stuff, but I would still take Bells Two Hearted IPA, which is cheaper and a more well-rounded IPA, over this.","Michigan, USA","lumberjack"

1160,"2007-03-07",3.9,"Bottle from Batch 7806 consumed within one month of the bottling date. Warm, hazy orange body with a notable conditioning load and creamy soft-white head. Sweet hop profile in the nose with notes of papaya, mango, grapefruit, and resin, plus an underbelly of light sticky malt and alcohol. Nice tropical fruit hop characters in the flavor.  Delivers a modestly bitter sensation.  Very good and very tasty without a doubt. But just a little too sticky and understated for me to rave about.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
1160,"2007-03-07",4.6,"The smell is the wonderful sharp citrus aroma of hops, and the pour is a cloudy amber, with almost no head.  The flavor... well, its hoppy, a strong citrus flavor that has the slightly oil mouthfeel of a good IIPA.  Alcohol content is very well hidden, and this is amongst my favorite IIPAs to drink.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
1160,"2007-03-07",4.1,"Slightly opaqe orange color. Pours with very little head. Nice citrus hoppy(obviously) aroma. Citrus flavor with a heavy hop kick, but not as bitter as expected. Almost has a barlywine feel to it. Slighty oily finish that diminishes quickly.","Walker, Michigan, USA","thebrownbomber"
1160,"2007-03-07",4.1,"Cloudy orange color.  Aroma of floral and citrus--especially grapefruit-- hops.  Flavor like a grapefruit bomb--very zesty and bracing, with some tangerine, but not all that bitter.  Body comprised more of a lighter cookie malt than the richer caramel/toffee malt of other 2IPAs. Leaves a mild ""citrus oil"" finish on the tongue. Actually quite resfreshing.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with flavors of the same with pineapple and grapefruit.  Nice brew.  I love bells.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
1160,"2007-03-06",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2011 My new favorite DIPA.  Cant add much to whats already been said, big strong citrus aroma.  Big strong hop flavor thats perfectly balanced without being too bitter or overbearing.  Would be higly drinkable if it werent for the high ABV.  Have 1 and really savor and enjoy it or have several but hand your keys over first!

My first visit here in over 3 years, my how the time has flown!  Hop Slam is still my favorite IPA.  Its the IPA I compare all others to.  The only downside is, none can compare. I  hate that its only available once a year but I compensate by buying several cases when it is around.  Expensive but definitely worth it!","Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania, USA","imzugzug"
1160,"2007-03-04",4.5,"Pours a wonderful clear light orange color (with the exception of the massive amount of floaties).  Aroma is out of this world. Fresh pineapple and other tropical fruits.  Good frothy white head and decent lacing.   Taste matches the aroma- just an assault of fruits and hop flavour. No astringent bitterness whatsover. Just amazing- trust Bells to accomplish that.  Along with the hops is a sweet malt back bone that gives a rich mouthfeel.  I would say that this is a balanced DIIPA despite the hops. Exceptionally drinkable which would be very dangerous.  I would love to try this on tap one day.  Alcohol is absolutely hidden.   Finish is a bit spritzy from the caronation but finishes clean somewhat bitter.
Best IIPA Ive had the opportunity to sample.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","oakbluff"

1160,"2007-03-04",4.2,"Pours a slightly hazy orange-apricot color with a foamy whitish head.  Aroma is quite pleasant, of very strong grapefruit and orange.  First impression is a very creamy mouthfeel, then an intense lemon/orange peel hop flavor.  The creamy, slightly prickly carbonation style perfectly balances a resiny, juicy hop base.  On finish, the flavor turns toward bitter, and the drink leaves a clean, dry aftertaste.  This is a delicious snack, thanks Indra!","Overland Park, Kansas, USA","frizzzzle"
1160,"2007-03-03",4.0,"Pours a white foamy head with a dark golden straw color.  The nose is nice, nothing I havent had beforeThis one is bitter all the way through.  The maltiness is overshadowed by the massive amount of bitterness with grapefruit and a slight sweetness coming in the end.  Just the way I like it!  Notes of alcohol come through after this one has gone down the hatch.  This is excellent!","Chesterfield, Virginia, USA","luv2brew"
1160,"2007-03-02",4.2,"Bottle.  Via trade with Ughsmash.  Batch 7690.  Somewhat murky pour with a copper color just this side of orange.  White lacing but no head. Buttery hop aroma with tons of grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit and some strawberry notes.  Big fruity bitterness.  More grapefruit in the flavor as well and flowers and pine.  Hop forward and dry.  Quite malty mid-palate but it finishes dry and bitter again.  A great IIPA.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"
1160,"2007-03-02",3.8,"12oz. bottle, batch #7741.  Aroma is suitably dominated by hops, these bringing a fresh and strongly fruity, piney, citric and lightly floral character, and with mere suggestions of honeyish and lightly toasty malt sweetness underneath.  Medium golden color with amber highlights and a rapidly thinning head.  Strikingly bitter, resinous hop flavor profile,  immense pine, juicy grapefruit, lemon and spice throughout with a malt presence that is more felt than tasted, although there is a small amount of sugary maltiness to find late.  Oily, prickly mouthfeel with a medium-full body.  Finishes very long and lingering, seeming to show off a much fuller spectrum of hop attributes as the beer is allowed to warm sufficiently.  Alcohol is nicely hidden here.  Fittingly named as it will serve nearly anyones hop fix.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1160,"2007-02-28",3.7,"Bottle provided by moejuck.  Pours muddy and lightly cloudy orange with a small rocky and frothy white head, somewhat lasting, fair lacing.  Aroma is average malt (bread, cereal), heavy hops (grass, citrus, orange), average yeast (dough) with notes of coriander.  Medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation and a bitter finish.  Long duration, light sweetness and acidity, heavy bitterness; hop is well-balanced with the caramel malt.  A little sweet but unoffensive.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1160,"2007-02-28",4.0,"This one has kind of a wierd aroma. The hops have a bit of a musk floating around. Other than that, its a nice complex spicey hop mixture that seems to avoid the typical IPA cliches. Malt balances the tingling hops. Tastes more like a really nice IPA.

1160,"2007-02-27",4.6,"poured from a 12oz. bottle into an oversized pilsener glass (review from Batch 7690 - bottled late Oct. 2006)

A: An absolutely stunning-looking beer, all golden orange and cloudy. Forms an ample cream-colored head with massive amounts of lacing. A beaut!

S: Smells delicious too, you can tell there are centennial hops in this brew (and at 100+ IBUs, a lot of them). Strong sweet floral & grapefruit aromas, HopSlam makes my mouth water.

T/M: Not for the faint of heart, this is a massive DIPA, both in body, ABV & taste. Loads of sweet malts massage the tongue up front, only to quickly give way to a bruising level of juicy, bitter hoppiness. HopSlam is at once both thirst-quenching and hangover-inducing.

D: If I were say, inhuman, I would drink these all day and all night. Since Im not, Ill say the reasonable limit is about 3-4 per night. Beyond that and youre risking severe intoxication, as this beer is far too easy to drink given its 9.3-10% ABV.

Highly recommended, one of the few beers that absolutely lives up to its massive hype.","Wood Ridge, New Jersey, USA","markgugs"

My only complaint is its a bit medicinal and herbal and I just dont like Double IPAs with that character.  But, it has a lovely malt character.

1160,"2007-02-15",4.2,"[12 oz. bottle] Inviting floral hop aroma, very fruity: grassy melon, peach and the ever-present grapefruit provide a very strong aroma. Pours a very hazy orange/yellow color with some chunks of yeast protein floating around. Flavors are pure hop flavors, dominated by grapefuit and citrus but still holding some nice complexity. At first things are really sweet, and floral, then turning to strongly acidic, citrus flavors. Some nice alcohol warmth contrasts things nicely. Overall, this is a huge beer and an outstanding IIPA.

1160,"2007-02-15",3.7,"On tap at a local bar (late night happy hour, $2.50 all domestic pints)  This is a beer that I enjoyed more early on in the experience.  I really enjoyed this beer the only thing I would complain about is the grapefruit flavor became a little over powering to me.  I would order another for sure, but I am not sure if I could have more than one of these at a time.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","mnstorm99"
1160,"2007-02-15",3.4,"I paid $16 for a 6 pack...
Appears a glowing golden orange with a creamy, 1 finger white head that slowly fades into a mild cap. Lots of streaky lacing is left around the glass. Whats this other mess going on? Tons of yeasty proteins and hop residuals floating in suspension with no visible signs of CO2. That doesnt look overly appealling.
Smell is extremely herbal up front with hints of skunky mary jane, flowers, tea leaves, black pepper, citrus zest, pineapple, grapefruit, along with some biscuit.
Taste...again, this strikes me as a very herbal brew moreso than a citrusy one. Flavors are highlighted by bitter herbs & spices, pine resin, grass, sweet citrus...hmmm.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter, sweet up front, grassy, herbal... dare I say medicinal, or solvent? Alcohol is evident.
Wow...based on this bottle, Id be willing to vote this one as the most over-rated beer that Ive had in 07. Last year, my vote went to Stone Oaked Bastard. This certainly isnt a terrible beer, its just very overly hyped IMO and Im not feeling the love. It sort of reminds me of a recent homebrew that I did, where I used a boat load of 6-7 different hops and hoped for the best. It turned out alright but a bit muddled, much like this with every aspect of hops being represented from herbal, to skunky, to citrus, etc. I just dont get it. Maybe the next bottle will change my mind. Ive only got 5 more to compare it with.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Smell is of citrus hops and just a tad of piney hops.
Taste is incredibly juicy. A refreshing taste that has plenty of hop presence. Its just a tad bitter, but its so juicy that its balanced well.
This is a very easy drinking beer. You dont even notice the alcohol at all. This is a highly sessionable beer. As Ive drank many of these on several occasions.

Hits hard with alcohol and bitterness that really hides the hop character.  Not much there if you can wade through the bitterness.  Obviously a huge, well crafted beer, but way over-the-top to be considered a fine beer.

The flavor was ever-so-slightly skewed toward malty sweetness... caramel and grapefruit at the core were just decadent... heavy pine, grapefruit, and juicy pears provide an ideal higher level of bitterness... alcohol is present only to accent the bitterness, provide warmth, and give you that tingly feeling on the backside of your gums... long, drawn-out sweet caramel and bitter grapefruit finish.

Im amazed you dont taste any excess alcohol on this one, I didnt realize the ABV was so high.

A big bitter kick up front fades to fruity citrus and pine flavors, followed by a sweet, caramel maltiness.  Although the end is sweet, it does leave a bitter aftertaste.

The beer was cloudy/hazy with a white persistent head which lasted well to lace the glass. The flavor was strong citrus, but remained well balanced with a strong malt backbone. The hops were resinous with a strong citrus presence of more orange and grapefruit coupled with caramel. Alcohol was a factor in the flavor but did not detract. The body was nearly full with a creamy mouthfeel due to a moderate level of carbonation. Overall a very nice Double IPA, with some sizable alcohol warming that occurred post consumption.

Aroma of lots of fruity hops--tart oranges, tangerines, pineapple, even some strawberry and blackberry--all not quite ripe, and therefore somewhat tart.  There is a bit of resiny hops in there as well.  Some light doughy bread--not much--is noted as well.  Flavor has some pinepple juice, tangerines, a bit of raspberry, some bready malts and alcohol is noticeable, but I wouldnt quite put it at 9.5%.  Dry lingering bitter finish.  Low to moderate carbonation, medium to full bodied.  This is one fruity hoppy beer.

Very big bitterness up front but withdraws fairly quickly, only to come back with moderate bitterness in the dry finish.  Alcohol very well covered.

Not so great this year. Aroma is the same, still amazing. But it seems like they added honey? Thats too bad because I hate honey, and it adds a (kind of gross) sticky sweet honey bit to the flavor that makes it less enjoyable and actually hard to finish. Dear Bells: Please go back to last years recipe.

Original Rating (Nov 2006 batch):

Intense ruby red grapefruit aroma and... passionfruit! The best aroma Ive yet to find in an IPA. Flavor is more of the grapefruit and balanced hop bitterness and alcohol, never overwhelming. Very chewy and juicy mouthfeel. Leafy. The first gulp is like sinking your teeth into two handfuls of the freshest juiciest grapefruit hops. Very slight metallic taste in the finish, but thats nitpicking. Perhaps a little one dimensional, but thats all right because its so good at what it does; definitely one of the most enjoyable IPAs Ive had in a while. Really, this ones good.

The taste caught me unexpectedly also I was expecting to actually taste the hops but the hide it well with the grapefruit and other citrus notes extremely well. Almost no sweetness to it from the hops. A powerfull bitter taste that in the mouth is very smooth and finishes cleanly overall with a lingering hint of citrus.

The aroma is pure bless with lots of tropic and citric fruit esters,  some pine and pepper, light bready malts, and a note of alcohol snap.  The flavor profile backs up the nose with a MOSTLY BALANCED fruity and bitter taste and some soft grainy malts. The finish is astrengent and metallic but works within the framework of the beer. Truly a straight forward yet not remotely boring big hoppy beer. The mouth feel matches the flavor components exactly, everything is where it should be.  Get ya some right now.

The pour is a mostly clear golden with a one inch white head.  The aroma is strong bitter hops, bright tropical pineapple fruit, and honey malt sweetness. The taste is the tropical pineapple fruit hops, moving quickly to a dank resin, and then closes with toasted malt and a touch of the honey.  The honey seems much more subdued compared to the 2012 and 2009.  The palate is medium bodied, soft carbonation, and a light warming alcohol in finish as the beer warms.  This was back to the beer I remember in 2010.  (9,4,8,4,16 - 4.1)
++++ Re Rate 2 February 2012 ++++
12 oz goblet draft at Martin City Brewing Company in Kansas City, Missouri.  The pour is a light haze golden orange with a very small light white head.  The aroma is honey herbal, strong citrus hop, and a malt sweetness. The taste is big on the herbal honey initially, followed close behind with the light clove, floral jasmine, orange citrus, resin, and a dry husky malt grain.  Some additional floral in the finish.  The palate is medium bodied, active crisp carbonation, and a dry finish.  Some light alcohol is present as it warms. Solid as always, though each year seems to be less of the revelation of the first time I had it.  (8,4,7,4,15 - 3.8)
++++ Re Rate 28 January 2010 ++++
12 oz bottle grabbed for me by Dansting. Batch #9502 stamped on the label, packaged on January 5, 2010 - at time of drinking, this is 23 days from hitting the bottle. Served at about 45 degrees, in my generic tulip glass. Pour is mostly clear straw golden copper with a firm two inch off white head. Head falls slowly with thick coating lacing. Pretty beer. Aroma is full, yet soft pineapple fruit hops, along with a heavy dose of resin and toasty biscuit maltiness underneath. Really nice balance, fresh, clean, hop forward. This years version does not have nearly as much sweet (almost cloying) honey that last years iteration had. Taste is the resin hops first, quickly followed by citrus / citric hoppiness. The malt of the nose is present, but is certainly in the back seat to the hops. What malt gets through is the biscuit / toast of the nose. Hop flavors are really big, brash, almost even abrasive. Palate is medium bodied, slightly below average carbonation, and a dry, tongue scraping finish. Residual heat is present in the long after taste, not sharp alcohol heat, more of a slow burn - expected for the size, and didnt detract too much. The aftertaste also features a bit of a dusty peanut shell taste - I have certainly had this with these uber-hoppy beers before. Always a fun one to try each year.  (9,5,7,4,16 - 4.1)

++++ Original Rating 17 January 2007 ++++
Bottle.  Poured into imperial pint.  From the pour, this looks delicious.  Cloudy yellow orange pour.  Smallish head with some layering.  Aroma is hop (of course) but catch some grassiness and citrus in there too.  Taste is an expression of the aroma, with fabulous body.  The taste had almost a cask quality to it.  Just a ton of complexity in the taste, from initial to finish, where there is a nice bitterness.  I was shocked to see 9.5% on this one, since I did not at any point detect alcohol.  In fact, I had two of these quite easily.  As mentioned by others, this is a dangerous brew.  (8,5,8,4,17 - 4.2)","Kansas, USA","theisti"

The 70 IBU rating seems a little low for an IPA@, but there is more to a great beer than IBU, late addition flavor/aroma hops contibute greatly to a beer without affecting the IBUs all that much.

Aroma is all hops, obvious citrus smells are orange, grapefruit, tangerine, big pineapple. Pine needle scent is splintering, concentrated. Flavor is more of the same, Hopslam truly is an apt name. The backside of the mouthfeel brings some of the most intense, pounding hop oil to tastebud penetration Ive encountered. Lovely taste with no unpleasant bitterness.

1160,"2007-01-14",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2012 Batch #7690 bottle, Jan. 2007. Pours with a big head in a shaker glass, that dwindles quickly to some rocky lace. Deep copper color with the usual Bells floaties.  Big catty and piney hop smell, the kind men like. Taste is big and brassy. Piney hops just dont stop, backed up by a thick and sticky malt. Not as deep a roast as other IPAs, but pretty hearty and with some nice ale fruitiness. Little alcohol burn to find. Excellent hop bomb. Should I lay this down for later or enjoy it while its hops are fresh?
Update, same batch, but 5 years later: All this talk about the new Bells Hopslam made me crack open one from my 2007 stash! Still some citrus hop to it, but mostly faded.

1160,"2007-01-14",4.0,"1/13/07.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained as a generous gift from mwsf on RateBeer 12/23/07.  Pours a lightly hazy but still opulent golden tan with medium-sized pale off-white head, variously rocky and creamy, lasting long in a thin patty.  Lacing is wonderfully dense and falls in patterned swaths, sticking from the top down.  Floral and grassy bouquet with tons of fruits-- tangerines, grapefruit, bruised mango, overripe orange, and something oddly funky.  Not quite sure if the funk here is from the hop combination or a fermentation character.  No sign at all of alcohol, a notable achievement with this strength.  Flavor is correspondingly grassy and fairly phenolic with some drying, straw-like presence.  Brightly hoppy and citric with several of the same fruits, strong but balanced bitterness.  Theres some fruity tangerine-zest acidity and perhaps even saltiness in the finish.  Malts take a dignified back seat overall, providing a crackerthin extra-pale toasty flour taste and letting the oily hops do the talking.  The resultant body seems to shrivel up and fall off with the flavor in the finish, but for a Double IPA thats better than having a body that is too full or syrupy and coats your tongue; it only means youre primed for another sip just as soon as you finish the preceding one.  Theres also a lingering, lightly-scratchy tickle of the straw flavors.  Id love to try this if they squeezed it a few points drier in the final gravity (without upping the phenols or creating any alcohol apparency), or with an EXTREMELY fresh sample or a dry-hopped keg.  Still, its hard to fault it for much of anything in particular (except for maybe that funk in the nose), as the alcohol is damn near undetectable and its criminally quenching and drinkable overall.  A damn good IPA.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

1160,"2007-01-13",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2007 12 oz. bottle. The aroma contains apricot, grape juice, wine, and citrus hops elements. It is unique and powerful. The beer pours an orange/dark gold color with a small amount of cream-colored head. The liquid is cloudy, and there is a large amount of suspended particulate. The flavor is sharply hoppy. The fruit notes from the aroma are also present in the flavor, but they are not as strong. In particular, there is a remarkable apricot nectar taste. If you like American hops and fruit flavors, youve come to the right beer. The alcohol is well masked. There is a good, biting, and long lasting bitter finish. This full-bodied beer is silky smooth yet still crisp and lively in the palate. It is very drinkable, and it leaves a nice, smooth after-texture in the back of the mouth. I was ready for the hop intensity of Hopslam, but the fruit flavors came as a pleasant surprise. The beer improves as it warms, and I suggest drinking it at near room temperature.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Quite bitter hops - mainly citrus (lime then lots of grapefruit), though also a fair amount of pine. The malt is well in the background, and very overshadowed. There is a strong suggestion of an alcoholic kick in the finish. Nearly full bodied, quite mild carbonation. Long lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, not unlike licking a pine and grapefruit forest up one side and down the other. Then repeating.

Frothy white head one finger in height left lots of lacing.  Aroma is of pungent piney and citrusy hops in mass quantities.  Theres some malt there but it is in the background and slightly doughy.  Flavor is a little muddled to me, the hops are a little dulled by the soft doughy malt and heavy yeast.  Maybe youd call this ""balanced"", but I prefer a cleaner crisper malt profile that resides behind the hops, not interwoven amongst.  Mouthfeel is creamy with very fine perfect carbonation.  Finishes slightly sticky and resiny.  This was pretty decent, but a little disappointing.  I think I wanted a little more heavier malt presence.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Aroma is pretty much just like picking up a handful of hops and taking a whif. However, there is a slight grassy sweetness as well.

Pours out a light yellow color (surprising..) with some orange hints.  Not much of a head at all.  Smell is pretty much hops, grass, grapefruits, some other citrus elements.  Taste is bold and bitter with some very strong notes of hops.  There isnt a whole lot of sugars from the malts going on here to balance out this monster hop beer.  It is good, but I think Ill stick with Two Hearted.  However, I am glad to have multiple bottles of this left back because now when I want to get a brutal double IPA, I have one.  Reminds me alot of Hair of the Dog Blue Dot in more ways than just appearance.

drank another one today, and its much better a little warmer than i originally had it.  bumping up the ratings a bit, this was good ass beer.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
1160,"2007-01-04",3.5,"Bottle from Footbalm. Strong citrus and pine aroma, lemon, pomegranite, acid. Very well balanced, good complexity, no off aromas, but just kinda boring. Pour is a cloudy gold with a decent head. Similar taste of rich hops, though a bit soapy, a little ""unripe"" tasting, if it were fruit. Definitely showcases hops for everything they are, though. A bit boozy and hard to drink.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

1160,"2007-01-03",4.1,"12oz. bottle Batch7690 thanks to SS. Murky orange/amber color with a small off white head and lots of floaties. Nice hoppy aroma of orange marmalade, grapefruit and some pine. Flavor starts off mildly sweet and malty, then quickly becomes quite bitter. Grapefruit pith, light pine and a sort of sourness that reminds me of sneaking tastes of my aunts whiskey sours when I was a kid. A different kind of IIPA which I liked very much.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"

Starts surprisingly smooth then turns very hoppy but surprisingly (and a bit disappointlingly) not as bitter as one might expect. The aftertaste leaves a tropical fruit flavor. On the whole, this beer reminds me of SunnyD. High alcohol is noticable, but not overly ""hot"". Very good, but not crazy good.

2/17/08, bottle, 2008 vintage. Thanks to kan for picking 2 of these up for me. aroma has big herbal, vitamin like, and grassy hop notes with some alcohol behind it. flavor is pretty bitter with good dose of boozyness right there with all those hops.

Welcoming aroma of strong grapefruit, some melon, floral, and a touch of caramel/toffee.  Taste follows with more biting grapefruit hops on the outset, a tamer malty finish, and enough lingering aftertaste to leave you wanting more.  A very nice palate all the way through.  This is one amazing IIPA and a hop fans nirvana!  Highly recommended.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
1160,"2006-12-31",3.9,"Bottle. A unclear orange beer with a dense orange head. The aroma is nicely hoppy with notes of citrus, alfaacid, grass, and grapefruit. The flavor is also very hoppy with notes of grapefruit - which makes it very acidic, combined with more subdued notes of caramel. The hops gives it a dry and rather bitter end, and the body is quite powerful.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1160,"2006-12-30",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2008 12 oz bottle, courtesy of StompBrockmore - pours a cloudy, glowing orange with frothy white head and lots of floating sediment that settles slowly and literally coats the glass bottom.  Aroma is pure grapefruit - not the typical grapefruity west coast hops, but ACTUAL grapefruit.  Like sticking your nose in a freshly cut grapefruit.  Some other tropical fruits in there as well - mango and passionfruit, some lychee perhaps?  Ive NEVER smelled any beer this fresh and fruity and lively before.  AMAZING.  The first sip is simply stunning.  All those fruit hops combine with a big malt backbone to create a superbly balanced beer.  Bitter off the bat, then smooth in mid-palate, then with a fading bitter finish.  Alcohol VERY well-integrated, which could prove to be dangerous if you have a few on hand (which, regrettably, I dont).  Certainly one of the best dIPAs Ive had - this is a benchmark by which all other IPA/dIPAs should be measured.  Damn - I wish this glass was a whole day long.

The pungent grapefruit, melon and maraschino cherry hop nose is exactly what I dig in IPA.  I certainly dig a nice dank, grassy hop nose, but the sour grapefruit sugary nose on this is even better.  I can’t think of anything I like more than the smell of this beer.  Perfect.   Amazingly creamy and smooth, with a moderately thick body, consumed in melon and grapefruit sour hop flavors, rich in every way.  This beer is good, but when warmer the nose tends to get a little boozy, smelling like dirty vodka.  If this were around 8% it would be pure gold.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Nice amount of sweetness. Juicy and semi dry finish with a pleasant lingering bitterness. Alcohol slighlty detectable. Nice beer. In fact, I just brought home a 12 pack from my travels to keep in the fridge.  Batch 8278. This years batch does not disappoint. It seems a tad drier on the finish, but otherwise still has this addictive quality to it. It is also very easy to drink. This is very unique in the world of IIPAs.

Some lightly sweet honey caramel malts start out the palate before a dousing hop cleansing.  Some strongly bitter pine and pulpy white grapefruit finish out the cleanly bitter final smack.

1160,"2006-12-27",3.6,"Unfiltered peach in color. Thin but fully sustained pure-white foam. Hefty hop aromas of cantaloupe, tangerine, mango, and pinesap. Sharp hints of green onion. Delicate honeyed malt sweetness. Vivacious bottle-conditioned carbonation expands on the palate. Body is dense and oily from the get-go, with not a whole lot of brightness to go along with it. Quickly becomes astringently syrupy and borderline cloying, due to the concentration of resinous hops. Sweetness wanes slowly as theres just enough acidity to lift some of the sappy weight. Crisp, crackery malts generate some cleanliness by imparting a dusty dryness along with fluffy touches of fresh biscuits, as do fresh mangoes and some shimmering citrus qualities, but an unpleasant sweetness and sogginess persists. Finishes remarkably balanced, with plenty of succulent hop flavors gently caressing then deflecting the spicy and grassy hops. Soggy/overripe tangerine notes increase at higher temperatures, but the mango remains relentless and salvages some of the essential brightness. Overall, the aroma could use a bit more cleanliness and more hoppy brightness. The flavor is also on the sweet side, which causes the hops to come across as being slightly muddled. And with the exception of some chewy yeast and slightly tacky textures, the level of attenuation is so close to perfection...just not quite there. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but very close. A few very-minor adjustments would make this a real standout. A solid effort from a great brewery.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1160,"2006-12-24",3.9,"12 oz bottle from Bello Vino in Ann Arbor, MI (late December 2006 -- last 6-pack!) consumed from a Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a bit below cellar temperature.   Hazy, soft orange-amber in color with a small-bubbled lasting off-white head that forms a trace of lacing.....apricots are the first fruit to hit the nose, followed shortly by sweet grapefruit, caramel and a touch of cinnamon, orangepeel and honey rounding out the medley of dessert treats after several sniffs, certainly well-done if fairly predictable.....I get virtually no alcohol apparent on the tongue, very dangerous as this is juicy and redolent of lightly fermenting fruits, perhaps infused with light maple syrup and honey, hop bitterness surprisingly restrained (well, not so considering the brewery perhaps but I would have expected more for it to be called an IIPA) although a fairly strong impact is made at the end when intense citric tartness and powerful hop oils finally do threaten to overwhelm the palate, but never do as it remains juicy and fresh and quaffable to the very end.  Somewhat hard, prickly carbonation works well against the overall soft fruitiness of the beer.  While I dont find this amazing it is certainly one of the easiest to drink and most likeable of 9% beers Ive had, and thats saying something.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Flavour - good lord this is amazing! First sip was incredibly bitter, but each subsequent sip was less intense and revealed much more of the same qualities found in the aroma.

1160,"2006-12-21",3.8,"2006 bottles drunk on numerous occasions in November 06Typical bells appearance, with light sediment on the bottom, and tiny bottle conditioned bubbles producing a lightly creamy, white head that is medium in height and retained very well, leaving clumps of lacing as it recedes.  High clarity leaving the sediment behind with just a slight touch of haziness.  Soft peach and honey colored body has a bit of tangerine and very light strawberry tones.Vibrantly fruity is the nose, with luscious lychee, strawberries, sweet cherries and guavas.  It tapers off teasingly in a modestly bitter, grapefruity finish that calls upon light base malt sweetness and an even more reserved caramel-like hint.  The aroma smells creamy, if thats possible.  Of abundant strength and just fantastically fresh and fuzzy are the hops.  Tremendous care with dry-hopping is apparent.  The malt sweetness and fruitiness do not come off overbearing, though they are definitely a factor in the nose.  Clean as always from Bells, but still distinctly Bells.  No alcohol noted.  Other things that arent noted:  overdone bittering, leafy/vegetal notes, obnoxious pine resin, astringent/hard crystal malts, sourish munich malts.Malt and hop immediately vie for power at first sip.  Sweet, honey-caramel malt notes are balanced by fruity, fuzzy, fresh, green, juicy hops.  Bitterness through the middle is quite reserved for a double IPA.  Some dry citric notes (white grapefruit, oranges, mild lemons) consider acidifying things, but a resurgence of malt sugars right before the finish wipe them out and youre left with more succulent hop flavors of watermelon, guava, cherry and strawberry.To be honest, my first impression was that this wasnt bitter enough, probably the first time Ive ever said that about an DIPA.  But the extra malt sugars that come through combine nicely with the hop notes to produce all of the softer, sweeter fruit notes mentioned, so its not so much of a bad thing in that aspect.  Just maybe a touch too sweet to drink too many of them, though DIPAs are hardly a session beer.  Still, Id be intrigued to see what a little more attenuation would produce.  Soft texture with a medium-low amount of carbonation that is reasonably tight.  Some hop acids and light phenolic dryness do eventually build-up and linger on the palate, with just an ever-so-slight touch of alcohol warming toward the end of the bottle, giving almost a bittersweet edge to the beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The beer poured an amber color with a good tightly-formed head which had nice staying pour.

The aroma was very hoppy without being citrusy or piney, and had a faint sulfur odor to it (thats not good).

Taste was hoppy and citrusy like many DIPAs, yet also had slightly out-of-place notes of grass or turpentine to it.  Ive had a good number of very hoppy beers, and Ive number experienced these particular flavor notes to this level of intensity.  A bit odd.

Glorious aroma of ruby red grapefruit, tangerine, pine needles.  Flavor is pine and light citrus, although Im having a lot of trouble discerning specific hop flavors.  Im getting mostly a generic bitter/sweet tradeoff, with a bit of toffee leading to a semi-dry finish.  Not very biting, and with surprisingly little  actual hop flavor.  Wow, given the strong hop aroma, Im kind of shocked.  This would be a decent strong ale, and if malted up a bit maybe even a barley wine, but the hop flavor seems to fall a tad short for this to be an awesome double IPA.

Sounds like a challenge/treat for my hop lovin palate.  Nice looking copper/caramel color with medium sized foamy head.  Sweet floral hop aroma with substantial sugary malt goodness in the nose.  Sweet and sticky hop flavor is wonderful!  Tastes from bitter to sweet roll across the tongue in a fantastic tasting brew!  Sweet malts mix with wonderful hop taste.  This is probably the smoothest DIIPA Ive had and I just want more.  Bells Rules!","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

Pours with a touch of yeast dustiness, but the beer is a lightly reddish hued, amber to copper color.  It is topped by a frothy, almost two-finger thick, light tan colored head.  The aroma is certainly quite hoppy; it is a mix of citrus, pine and even a more dank hop note similar to onions or perhaps even garlic.  The hop aromatics are certainly an interesting mix.  The predominant character is that of audaciously vibrant sweet citrus and exotic fruit aromas; notes of apricots, lychee, pineapple, candied orange peel, concentrated ruby-red-grapefruit, and other tropical fruit notes make up the dominant notes.  Behind the upfront hop fruit though is a touch of more raw hop character; hints of pine, menthol and that onion-like almost garlic character lurk in the back ground, just enough to add a hint of complexity.  Where is the malt?  I couldnt tell you underneath all of the hops.

The taste is sweet with the fruity hop notes, in fact the sweet fruitiness just sticks around clinging to the palate even after the beer has left my mouth.  The hop fruit notes are much the same as I noticed in the aroma, but here there is a touch of biting bitterness to add a touch of balance.  You know it is a hop focused beer, when you need hop bitterness to balance other hop derived notes.  The malt is buried here, playing only a supporting role, there is certainly enough malt to not allow the hops to be dominating and raw, but definitely not enough more my hop flagellated taste buds to notice.  It has just enough mouthfeel / palate coating ability to help the dominant hop character along; I wouldnt say that this was a beer you wanted to pound, but it is dangerously quaffable.

The hop character here is so smooth & even soft (despite being amped up and loud overall); the brewer definitely took a heavy handed approach with smooth fruity hops like Simcoe and Amarillo when brewing this beer.  The flavor does not have much, if anything, noticeable of the onion / garlic note that I experienced in the aroma, though perhaps there is a touch of it in the finish.  Really the finish is dominated by a smooth, lingering bitterness that perhaps takes on a touch of mentholated pine.  I really am a sucker for these smoothly fruity, over the top, one dimensional hop bombs.  This is quite bitter, though I dont necessarily realize it most of the time.  This is totally only comprises one dimension of the usual three that a beer can have (hop, malt and yeast), but it is so enjoyable in its expression of the hop.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Big nose of orange and grapefruit, very Simcoeish. Some pine in there as well. Lovely nose. Assertive (if not insane) attack: medium high body, active carb, big bold hop flavors (theres that citrus and pine again). Some sweet caramel malt goodness but nothing too competitive; this is the hops serve and few IIPA malt volleys are big enough to break it. Tingly, lingering sweet-bitter finish.

A gold colored beer with a thick and long lasting head, and definitely unfiltered.  It is rare to see an IPA with so much sediment. Flavor is bitter hops but not unpleasantly bitter.  There is a light hop burn, that is increased in its intensity by the alcohol.

Theres plenty of coriander, white pepper, allspice and light saffrons in the first bite. The malt is light and adds only a gentle caress of pale caramel and grain sugars to reign in the runaway Marakesh express. As the hop flavors morph on the tongue, they diverge into a candied orange citrus and more resins at the base of the flowers. Airy and light. Alcohol warms the nostrils, drawing the delicate and sweet hop perfumes into the nose. Quite elegant and refined. Im really amazed at how drinkable this is and with such lightness (although not thin) it carries the hop flavors well.

In the aroma, its all pungent, spikey, in-your-face hoppitude!
Tropical fruit on top, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit,mango, raw, pulpy and vibrant. Pine forest floor, and more. Slightly sweet citriuc feel, but bitter hop feel dominates.

Taste: once more, a charge of hops on the tongue, not delivered too lightly. Same citric flavor storms the palate, but a second after it boards, theres a nice, creamy relief. Rolls playfully on the tongue, like a cat on the rug preoccupied with string. Each new sip imparts this deliciousness, but despite the huge !BUs and way-up-there ABV, you d hardly know it. 

Amazingly easy to drink, if youre a hop craver like me. Wow! Tangy, potent hoppy twang never quits the mouth. Incredibly full bodied, long-finished, and commendably created. Mmmm, delicious!

1160,"2006-12-01",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2008 Rerate 2008 Vintage: 
Aroma is very floral.  Very strong, sometimes almost off putting, as strange as that sounds.  Appearance is quite awesome.  Very nice creamy head with impressive lacing.  The flavor is intriguing.  As noticed in last years version, this is basically Two Hearted on steroids.  Its weird, some sips the flavor is a little harsh, whereas others are simply divine.  I really like this beer, but at times its almost over the top.  

Original Rate 2007 Vintage:  I was trying to locate this once it hit the Twin Cities.  Blue Max where I frequent did not have it in until tonight...when I spotted the last 6 pack in the cooler (hard to know if there were any more in stock hiding in the back rooms).  Pours a golden orange with a quickly disappating white head.  Leave lace all over the tulip glass it was poured in.  Very much reminds me of Two Hearted in flavor, but slightly stronger in the ABV department.  Larry Bells hit the jackpot again!  Genius!  Pure Genius!  Yes there are hops here, but 70 IBUs is hardly near the max bittering units Ive tasted.  Sweet Beer indeed.

Hoppy taste (well, you guessed that) with citrus and (less) resiny. Finish is more hopbitterness, slightly burning. One almost imagines drinking added hopoil.

1160,"2006-11-30",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2009 Rating #300.  Bottle.  Wonderful aroma that is quite different from Bells other hoppy monster, Two Hearted.  Here the hops is much more citrus-based.  I pick up grapefruit and sweet pineapple as the dominant hops scents.  Not so much of the resin/pine as in 2-Hearted.  Aroma is very reminiscent of Stones 10th Anniversary.  Pour is a slightly orange golden color with a bit of a haze about it and a pretty substantial frothy head.  As its dying back Im seeing lots of lacing.  Flavor is very hops dominated, but it doesnt ever get out of control like a lot of hops heavy brews.  The hops from the aroma give way to a more pine presence in the finish here, and this beer is mostly about the finish.  Right before that there is a caramely malt presence, but it is fleeting at best, yielding to the heavy hopping.  I find that it seems like there is a bit of a gap in the flavoring as it melts from malt to hops and for just a split second it comes off as watered down or something, but then comes the alcoholic warmth and the hops bite and all thoughts of this being a weak beer are long gone.  That said, I think Id prefer Two Hearted Ale to this one, but Im not sure you could go wrong with either.  Darn fine.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
1160,"2006-11-30",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2007 Big, huge, grapefruit and pine aroma and flavor.  Not much malt, but thats characteristic of the style.

BTW, theres all this talk of ""tropical.""  Its definitely citrusy but tropical? maybe as an extreme form of citrus.  im done with this rating.  RERATE, this is way more fruity than i remember.

1160,"2006-11-30",4.3,"Hokey Smokes!  The hops jumped out of the bottle and slapped me in the face, then dove up my nostrils as soon as I uncapped this baby!  [Good looking, too, a pale copper with a white head that pastes delicate lacing along the sides of the glass.]  This is a sniffing beer, something Linda (my imaginary girlfriend according to a certain <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/ViewUser.asp?UserID=3 will never understand.  The hops continue to hop into my nostrils, withering the graying hairs.  Pine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, tart tangerines, and - I swear - a stalk of rhubarb.  I think only knowing that its an IIPA gives the mental suggestion that theres a sweet caramel buried neath it all.  I am instantly blown back upon enjoying the first sip...a ridiculously lopsided lupilin rush twists my tongue in circles and leaves me loose-limbed and longing for more.  Oh wait - someone else wrote that!  But upon my first sip, I, too, was noose-numbed with my ting pretzelled into non-Euclidian shapes.  The intense bitterness gnaws at my tongue and begins to pluck my nasal hairs and tears of a hop-heads intense glee form in my eyes.  A touch of caramel annoys me with its sweet interference of my painful and pleasurable experience.  By the third tasting the sturdy ABV hits my veins and my other ear falls to the ground and mingles wih the dust bunnies under my table.  My tongue is burning with the prolonged bitter finish, and Im starting to get pissed that what seemed to be an act of generosity from a life-long friend and colleague was actually a willful act of cruelty.

1160,"2006-11-30",4.0,"10 oz snifter on tap @ Brew Kettle 11/28/06: Lasting creamy off white head w/an orangey colored slightly hazed body.  Initial aroma is piney/grapefruity/pineapple hops, followed by a balancing toasty and caramel malt character.  Fruitiness is all about the hops near as I can tell.  Overall fairly well balanced for a big beer, but hops dominate the flavor as expected, but not overpowering to the point of being hop juice.  Bitterness creeps into the semi bitter finish and lingers just a bit.  Toasted and bready malts, as well as caramel play supporting rolls to keep it from being too bitter.  Very well rounded overall flavor and the hops are pleasant, not harsh.  Mouthfeel is very full, smooth with low medium carbonation, & well hidden alcohol.

1160,"2006-11-28",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2007 Pours a pale clear orangey gold with a big healthy loose white head.  The nose is lightly sweet and full of big hops.  Particularly prominent was a piney unripe mango note with hints of pineapple and resin.  The mouthfeel is really very nice.  Its not as thick as many in the style, but feels substantially viscous with low carbonation, befitting the style.  The flavors are subdued compared to the nose, but nice nonetheless.  Again, big piney unripe mangos, obvious pale malt sweetness with just the lightest touch of caramel and pineapple.  The finish clean and lightly sweet with an immediate amping up of the hop flavors.  Its not until the aftertaste that the full bitterness kicks in.  Really resinous pine notes with huge bitterness and a bit of alcohol warming (this being the only place where alcohol shows up).  As it warms I start picking up spicy hints of kaffir lime.  This is really a deliciously well balanced brew.  I would almost say this is too balanced to be a double IPA, but Im certainly not complaining.  The alcohol is really the only thing that prevents this from being a session beer!  Better overall than Two-Hearted, and yet I rated it lower?  Maybe its because I expected this to be more double?  Maybe because theres not a lot of complexity?  Maybe its because I drink a few pints of Two-Hearted every Sunday watching the Patriots game?  In any event, I love them both!

I dont know what sort of crack I was smoking when I rated this.  I had to boost the flavor by 1, the hops are so tangy, even as this poor beer ages, it holds its own.

There is a bit of an emptyness in the flavor- I get more out of the aftertaste than anything else, which is super bitter and hoppy with some citrus.

1160,"2006-11-27",5.0,"I must say, finally, a Double IPA with the balance and acidity of an IPA, only in a bigger version.  This IS a Double IPA and not a Double Pale Ale like so many interpretations of this style.  Dark gold in color with some yeast in suspension (hell no, I did not decant=waste yummy stuff).  The yeast actually traps the light a bit and lightens the color.  Tons of sweet, fruity malt with juniper berries, grapefruit juice, grass, some pine, honeydew melon, peach and a tonic water, quinine element.  Flavor is tasty and not overdone.  All of the aroma elements are in the flavor, there are actually textural components from the hops and yeast, there is some alcoholic warmth, a strong bitterness and acidity that is reminiscent of tonic water.  The tonic water acidity comes in to the palate at the perfect time to intrigue the drinker into another drink.  It cleans things up at the perfect moment to make this a huge beer but one that is incredibly drinkable as well.  My first perfect score, and it is well deserved.

Nice looking stuff is orange gold, clouded, some visible sediment, and an off-white head that recedes quickly to a thin film.  The aroma is pleasant, inviting, with much citrus - mostly resembling those kickass oranges I got a Wegmans a couple months back - and some strong grassy earthtones (hay) that I did not expect.  Background aromas are catty, tropical, and theres something tucked away in there thats like artificial pineapple flavor.  Body is alive with mild eff keeping the beer feeling light and quenching.  Good bitterness from front to back.  The flavors really expose the catty hops, especially retronasally, and yet the predominant lingering flavor is of more citrus, almost a marmalade on light biscuits...but not quite that sweet.  Very nice stuff and worth a second look but the overall impression I get it that of a very nicely done beer that turns me off slightly because of the variety of hops being used.

HUGE hit of pungent, fruity, resiny hops (grapefruit, mango and pineapple), it even smells acidic - very sweet too;  wow.  Taste - more bitter,less fresh hops - quite good, but a bit of a step-down from the aroma - long bitter citrus-zest finish, enough malt to still seem quite sweet.  Average body, acidic, astringent and bitter mouthfeel, long linger - solid, if ultimately one-dimensional I2PA.  Thanks, Jan!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

1160,"2006-11-21",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2006 I thought this beer was similar to Two Hearted, just a little bigger.  The flavor was sweet,slightly hop dominated giving it a moderately sweet pineapple and apricot flavor.  Moderate to low bitterness, no alcohol in the flavor at all.  Well made beer.  I think if you like Two Hearted, you gotta like this one.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
1160,"2006-11-21",4.4,"$13 a sixpack in Evansville. Hazy orange gold body is topped by a small offwhite head that retains well and leaves generous lacing. Juicy orange, mango, and grapefruit esters to the nose with some unusual notes of composted grass or even cat urine. Still, very lush. Creamy carbonation enlivens the medium body. Solid hop bitterness on the tongue. Citrusy grapefruit and some lemon rind with just enough of a pale malt backbone to preserve sanity. A totally different than Bells Two Hearted Ale, my usual standby. A truly exceptional DIPA.","Jenkins, Kentucky, USA","merlin48"

Total hop smell in this beer. I love it!  Taste of pine, grapefruit, oranges, lemon zest, a pinch of salt, sugar, malt and HOPS!  Great sour bitterness that lingers for awhile.  Alcohol is present.  I will have to stock up on this one.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
1160,"2006-11-20",3.3,"lots of initial head on pour on orangey brown. I grabbed this as an IPA, and then I find out quickly its a double hophead and higher alcohol than I expected. Its a bitter, sucking the leaf sucking the lime hop delivery that works and is satisfying aftertaste, not in your face or substantial malting as in other DIPA. My tongue was frozen later on. Good carbonation. Good but overated.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
1160,"2006-11-20",3.6,"To be honest, I had no idea on what style this was when I had it. Received thru a trade with Ogglethorp (thanks!). Aroma is really outstanding with huge notes of grapefruit coming thru. I didnt get really much else because the hops were so overpowering. Unfortunately, there wasnt much else than grapefruit in the nose. Mouthfeel was a bit harsh but nothing too bad. Flavors were grapefruit, lemons and a little malt. My buddy I was tasting it with described the flavors as being ragged and he was dead-on. There wasnt anything clean or refined about this. It was good drinking, but I think due to the overpowering one hop taste and aroma I couldnt drink more than one. There is something to be said about mixing things up a bit.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

11/20/2006:  Wow, my mouth is watering just smelling this beer!  The aroma reminds me of a freashly opened can of mandarin oranges in light syrup mixed with some fresh peaches.  The beer is a hazy bright orange color with a large foamy, cream-colored head.  Even after the head falls, it leaves a nice bubbly crown and heavy, detailed lacing.  The flavor is rich and packed with a wonderful apricot/peach hoppiness and a sweet malty base .  The long finish is slightly sweet with hints of alcohol, grapefruit, and a smooth hop bitterness.  It has a slightly thick body and feels great in the mouth.  This beer is extremely well balanced and the alcohol is amazingly well hidden for the 9.5% ABV thats in there!  Be careful with this one because it goes down extremely smooth and fast!  Bells Hopslam isnt quite a juicy as Weyerbacher Double Simcoe IPA or sweet and thick as Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA.  However, it somewhere in between the two and packs a great apriot/peach/orange/grapefruit flavor!

11/18/2009:  Bells Hopslam Ale...  Aroma:  Still plenty of hops, although not quite as vibrant or juicy, more like aged; dried candied pineapple, red grapefruit, tangerine and clementine peel; some toffee malt.  Appearance:  Cloudy tarnished gold color; frothy crown; plenty of floaties. Flavor:  Plenty of toffee and caramel; moderate bitterness; nice accompanying alcohol burn; aged/dried citrus and apricot; the floral qualities are coming through more now.  Palate:  Fairly thick, although still very smooth.  Overall:  This beer has become a very nice barleywine-style ale!

Huge grapefruity hops in the nose, along with a touch of sweet malt. Medium-bodied with a rich hoppy character that is full of zesty citrus and some pine, along with the nice sweet malt and honey that balances it all. The alcohol is well-hidden but you can tell it is there. Some sweet malt and fruit flavors are underneath as well. The finish is nicely bitter and lasting, retaining the citrusy hops feel.

I smell a very heavy earthy tone to this beer, lots of pine and citrus. Taste is a little more on the citrus side, with a little bit of the pine in the after taste. Seems to have just a bit of sweetness to it. Oddly enough, this was not as hoppy as I would have thought. The malt in this beer compliments the hops making this one great beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","cewldre"

The nose does not wait for you to sniff it to make itself known.  Huge pungent hop nose of pine and resin.  If you like hops, you will like this beer.  The alcohol is well hidden under all the flavor.  Grapefruit rind, candied orange peel, pineapple, resin, apricot all explode on a stage of enough caramel sweetness and malts to support them, but just barely.  This is a huge beer, and I think it did in fact bruise my tongue, but it is a solid example of this extreme style.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

1160,"2006-11-17",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2009 1-16-09. Bottle. Clear, light orange body. Next to no head. Nose of grapefruit, orange peel, resin. The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet and moderately bitter. The finish is moderatley to heavily bitter with a moderately sweet aftertaste. Chewy. Seems to get sweeter every year. If this gets any sweeter, I am going to reduce my rating.

1-20-08. Bottle. This years release presents a sweeter, orange citrus backbone that is much more noticeable than last years. The nose is still filled with juicy citrus fruit  orange, grapefruit, pineapple and tangerine. But the flavor is sweet grapefruit juice  still heavily bitter, but now moderately sweet. I like the balance better.

2-12-07. On cask at BWW, Indy. The bitterness is even more pronounced in this daft version, muting most of the edgy sweetness.

11-17-06. Bottle. When I think breweries that know their way around hops, I first think of Three Floyds and Stone and AleSmith  and Bells. So it didnt surprise me that Hopslam was brimming with juicy citrus aroma and flavor. Cloudy golden pour with comfortable off-white head. The nose is strong and filled with sweet oranges, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine and apricot. The flavor is 95 percent hops  bitter almost from the start and lasting well after youve swallowed. There is a little sweetness around the edges. Full body. Moderately thick, chewy texture with a raspy feel and resinous coating. Cant help but think of a thicker, richer version of Two-Hearted.

1160,"2006-11-17",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2008 I must admit I am disappointed by this beer. Yes, its delicious. Yes, it smells yummy. But I expected a Dreadnaught level beer, and this one, for me at least, does not have the malt backbone of Sir Naught.
For Gods sake, let this one warm up. It is a very very very good ale and needs to be drunk at a civilized temperature. This baby is just a tad bit of malt from dreadnaught. That in itself is a feat.","Cleveland, USA","Ubiquibeer"
1160,"2006-11-17",4.3,"As has been stated many times, the grapefruit hops aromas infiltrate the air. Its immediately apparent that theres a ton of hops present in this beer. The colour is an interesting shade of orange with a white and somewhat thin layer of foam on top. The flavour is initially sticky and sweet but a flood of hops fill your mouth. Theres so much citrus and fruity hops in here that its a bit of a departure from the overly bitter and resiny IPAs Ive been having as of late. That departure is a nice thing, however. Id say move over two hearted, but at the same time this is so good and almost of a different category.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
1160,"2006-11-16",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2007 Yowza!  The hops literally leap from the glass and into my nose.  Oranges, grapefruit, mango, papaya, pineapple...could this get more tropical?  Some candied sweetness taboot.  The hops continue to shine in the body - and they are even more defined.  More fruitiness is unfortunately balanced by very little malt, but thats OK.  I could drink these all day long.  This defines hop juice.  A tiny alcohol burn in the finish is the only real hindrance.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Hopslams BIG BOLD blasts of citrusy fruit aromas opened up my sinus cavity.  Mouthfeel, was medium to thick with lots of hoppy bitterness cutting through the tang. Flavor was consistent throughout with traces of lemon and tangerines mixing with California grapefruit and blood oranges.

Starts out with an over-the-top nasal hop assault...all citrus and pine...all of which emanates from the beautiful coppery golden pour.   In fact, the aroma alone might be enough to satisfy some novice hop-goblin...but not me!  I am instantly blown back upon enjoying the first sip...a ridiculously  lopsided  lupilin rush twists my tongue in circles  and leaves me loose-limbed and longing for more.   Then and only then, does the wild citrus-fruit flood unleash itself upon the palate, as if trying to make up for the merciless tongue-buckling that  just preceded it.   9.5%...I dont taste any of it...but believe me, its lurking in the shadows alright!

1160,"2006-11-15",4.4,"Semi-translucent with a white spider web stretching on top, leaving white doily lace. Truly an ambitiously green aroma: citric green centennials assault the nose with honey suckled marigolds, lemon grass, brazed pine resin and pink grapefruit plucked way too prematurely (in a good sense here, though the produce guy would likely disagree.) Lovely, balanced flavor is affirmed at first sip. Fruity apricot chews and nectarines imbed a sugary sweetness as dried fruits should (again, sorry produce guy.) Greasy, oily hop juice is in full existence in every imaginable way. Sugar-coated grapefruit gets some rock candi sweetening but the mean-green-cream machine cant be altered from its course. Dry tongue scraping comes about after a good candle wax coating is lifted. Freshly cut spring morning grass gets kicked into shinguards, where it eventually fornicates with apricot cleats and honeyed daffodil stems. Oily palate procession walks out with sweet apricots, nectarines and ripening grapefruit.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Ruby red grapefruit with some mild herbs and flowers coupled with light fruit and light malt. You like hops, you should not find may faults with this scent. Light fleshy aroma that throws things off for me. Quite a bit of fruit and flowers in this one. The last of pack here and I am starting to catch a lot of fruit an flower. Perhaps a touch too much, but still I am attracted. Lots of fruit with berries, pears, apples and other light fruit. Still a big hops presence. For me the flavors hops combine with the sweetness and create a brew that is slightly too sweet. This is a sweet brew that like Yukon Jack is way too good to think that it could be dangerous.

Poured a cloudy golden orange with a fluffy, foamy white head that slowly settled into a thin creamy lacing, small amount of ringed sticking.

The aroma of American DIPA heaven, pine resins, floral leafiness and grapefruity and a subtle caramel in the background along with small whiffs of alcohol.

Good, even and steady carbonation, and a crisp, hop slick, creamy smooth light bodied mouthfeel.

Delicious hop taste without being a complete taste bud killers, only a slight numbing of the tongue, grapefruit juicy along with the a little rind, piney with a little oiliness, a subtle floral leafiness, the hop bitterness is actually pretty soft. but has a rolling, lingering presence in the palate, the alcohol is well masked, lightly warming and makes a brief flash in the taste towards the end, and a dryish light caramel malty and hoppy finish.

Smelt strongly of grapefruit, spruce, with moderate pepper, barnyard, essence of  joy.

Taste was upfront strong bitter ruby red grapefruit followed by a strong piny earthy bitterness on a never-ending finish.  If you wait it out it turns grassy, then flowery.  Palate was medium bodied, silky smooth and cream, softly carbonated, moderately astringent and light alcoholic warmth.

Overall, everything is amazing about this beer, except maybe the flavor profile.  It was so smooth and tasty for its strength it left me wondering where the complexity and promise for cellaring was.  Also slightly tasted like pellet hops or hop concentrate, if there is such a thing.  I want to love this more but its daftly simple for a double IPA and too perfectly balanced when young.  Im torn and confused, intrigued and mesmerized.  Damn you Larry Bell, I finally have a double IPA crack my top tier.

1160,"2006-11-10",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2008 fresh 12 oz bottle.... tons of pine and citrus seep out of the bottle before ive even tipped it over; surely this is two-hearteds bigger badder brother.  lighter-bodied than i expected, as its not much fuller than two-hearted but the alcohol and hops punch is huge.  crisp pale malt flavors hide in the background, while hidden, theyre clearly there.  bitter through and through, but its not a caustic bitterness, more of a through-and-through bitterness.  not a beer i would really drink a significant quantity of but it certainly hits the spot for a double IPA.  reminds me very much of the centennial bitterness of two-hearted but there are some flavor and aroma hops that i cant quite put my finger on.... i think i prefer two-hearted.  good stuff anyway!","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
1160,"2006-11-10",4.4,"12oz bottle (thanks Josh!). What a cool looking label! Poured a medium amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Had strong fresh green leafy hoppiness aroma with orange peels. Sticky. Tastes of oranges, caramel, floral, with a grapefruit finish. Smooth and way too easy to drink. Alcohol content well hidden.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1160,"2006-11-09",4.0,"Pours a hazy golden amber with an average off white head.  Aroma of very fresh hops, earthy, grapefruit, orange and hints of alcohol.  Flavor of bitter grapefruit, pine, alchol and lemon.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
1160,"2006-11-09",4.0,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a white head. The aroma is full of hoppish qualities of grapefruit and pine.  The flavor is excellent with citrus and pine and the finish is sharp and pronounced.","USA","ehhdayton"
1160,"2006-11-08",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2010 Bottle.  Light amber with a frothy head.  No dought the hops produce a good bitter brew with nice fruity tones. Just tastes so fresh like a harvest ale.   Normally I dont enjoy the big floral almost perfume tones but Bells does it perfect. Alcohol might be hiden well but drink 2 and you will feel it.","West Bloomfield, Michigan, USA","gearbike"
1160,"2006-11-08",4.0,"Bottle. Poured amber color with a large frothy white head that was lasting with excellent lacing. Heavy complex sour citrus aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium sour citrus bitter flavor with a medium sour bitter finish of long duration. This is a standout beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1160,"2006-11-08",4.2,"Soft-colored copper-orange pour that is amazingly clear and carbonated for the heft of this brew.  Aroma is rich and powerful with its strong notes of pine and citrus and a nice dryness in the end. Palate is heavy and enticed from the hop profile. Flavor is an expected double IPA tartness up front with a prickly pine character dominant, before a brief dryness that finishes remarkably clean.  The impact of the hops both in the nose and taste are truly impressive. For the alcohol and weight of this beer it is incredibly drinkable.  I didnt think Two Hearted could be improved upon. I am happy to be wrong.","New York, USA","lethe"
1160,"2006-11-08",4.3,"Bottle: Clear orange in color with a medium white head. Aroma, pine, some pine needles, some resinous notes, and then some more pine with a splash of citrus. Basically my dream come true for the aroma. Flavor, some light maltiness, and then the resinous piney notes, with some fruits to it as well. Nice bitterness on the finish, but the flavor isnt as bright as the aroma would lead you to believe. Still its damn good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
1160,"2006-11-06",4.2,"This already my second one of these. The first one I tasted seemed almost all tropical fruits but this time I would say it was mostly pineapple, pine, and a little mango. The aroma was great one of the best IIPA aromas ive smelled. This was bitter but not overly bitter. A little maltiness coming through but mostly hops on my end. The alcohol was well hidden in this but it was not thick or cloying. I was practically counting down the days til this came out and i hope this becomes like expedition and is released more than once a year.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"
1160,"2006-11-06",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2007 Pours to a thick, hazy shade of dandelion yellow, with an aroma like rubbing your nose in rose petals, orange rind and cedar ashes.  A gentle, whimsical peach grove leads a delicious blend of clementine, grapefruit and lemon flavors with hints of dry tobacco, some bell pepper and no presence of alcohol.  Very flavorful - its bitterness is rich and warming like a thick blanket.    Updated.  Bottle aged three months.  Those lovely fresh fruit flavors have turned uncannily canned.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1160,"2006-11-06",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2009 Lots of hop bitterness and citrus smell/taste. You start to enjoy it as soon as you pop the cap! The addition of honey in 2008 seems to have smoothed the flavor and hidden the alcohol---but makes it sweeter than many DIPAs. Just about perfect for hop lovers!","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","milewide"
1160,"2006-11-05",4.0,"12oz bottle pours amber with a nice fluffy offwhite head that faded pretty quickly.. Good aroma of tropical fruits..  Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, some pine there as well.  Flavor is grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and some good caramel malts behind it.  Smooth full bodied and easy to drink.. Nice bitter finish..  Quite balanced.. Alcohol covered well.  This one is dangerously easy to drink and amazingly tasty.. Ive been looking forward to this and I wasnt disappointed","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
1160,"2006-11-05",4.0,"I have been anticipating this brew ever since I heard there were rumors of a new bells iipa (four hearted ale anybody?).  I liked this beer quite a bit.  The aroma was really nice, with pineapple, mango, grapefruit, piney resin, centennial hop flowers, even smelled a little like sugar coated fruits.  I liked it  lot.  The flavor was nice, nothing great but it was good.  A lot of the same cam through in the flavors with a really big bitter finish that left you wanting to drink more.  Overall another excellent beer from Bells...but would ya expect anything less from them?","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
1160,"2006-11-04",4.2,"Oh mother. Ive been waiting months for this And it is good. Hops in your face. In your mouth. Just the right solid punch you need when you cant drink an IPA without hops.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
1160,"2006-11-03",4.4,"Pours a nice orange with small but persistent head. Wow, awesome aroma of grapefruit and other citrus fruit. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit on the tongue with a very sticky mouthfeel. Top notch IIPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","verymerrymonk"
1160,"2006-11-03",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2006 Pours a clear golden orange with a yellowed off-white head. Resiny aroma for sure, gobs of pine and citrus with some malyt and a bot o funk? Some pineapple as well, for the most part pretty fresh in the nose. The flavor is a bit hot woth some nice sharp bitterness torwards the back of the tounge...nice amount of malt to keep it all in check. Smooth carbonation, creamy,  with hot boozey elements...sweet in front, dry in the middle with a long bitter end through the sticky finish. Pretty nice stuff, though the flavor does seem a bit metallic at times. Overall, a few minor quirks keep this one behind two-hearted for my must-buy-once-a-week list.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
1160,"2006-11-03",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2007 Bottle:  Huge hop aroma with lots of citrus, grapefruit, pine, and pineapple.  Pours a hazy golden-orange with a large white with orange tint head that has good retention.  Very good lacing.  Flavor starts pretty sweet with orange and pineapple.  Big hoppy finish with lots of grapefruit, pine, and light acidity.  Definitely a hop monster, but still balanced.  Lingering grapefruit aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is rather creamy with very mild carbonation.  Glad to find out this wasnt a ""one and done"".  A beer that I will make sure is always around the house.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1160,"2006-11-03",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2006 Poured with a pale color, nice white foamy head, great aroma of hops, grassy and floral, piney hop bitterness with some grapefruit flavor.  The hops burned the top of my mouth and tingled up into my nose.  Not the same floral/citrusy hop flavor as two hearted, but more bitter.  Very good.","Beachwood, Ohio, USA","Chucks66"
1160,"2006-11-02",3.7,"pours a slightly hazy light copper with a thin white head.  lots and lots of hops in the aroma. citrus and floral w/ a slight pine undertone.  aroma carries over into the flavor with  a nice malty sweetness that almost balances it out.  still a little on the extreme hoppy side, but its a IIPA, so thats fine with me.  medium mouthfeel and a bitter finish.  good IIPA.","The Land of Milk and Honey, Ohio, USA","Cliff"
1160,"2006-10-30",3.5,"I would agree with Bells description of a Tongue Bruiser.  Very flavorful, but so hoppy and without any malt balance, this beer is NOT of the same class as Stone Ruination or Three Floyds Dreadnaught.  Nonetheless, this may be the hoppiest tasting beer I have tasted - and I prefer 2IPAs.","Dallas, Texas, USA","dukefan"
1160,"2004-09-06",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2010 5/14/10-  Sweet bubblegum aroma with plentiful hops. Aroma is very distinctive, but not dissimilar to Bells Two Hearted. Hazy copper with fine bubble carbonation. Strong alcohol profile; this brew is sweet, hot and hoppy. At various times Ive had this beer when its been one of the best beers Ive ever had to just really good. This time is closer to the former. As sweet as Hopslam smells and tastes, I feel like it should be even a touch sweeter to be perfect.Theres an alcohol harshness in the finish that wants to be cut somewhat. Still, a wonderful brew that was a wonderful addition to the beer world when it was born.

2004 GTM. Aroma not overly hoppy, more citrusy. Looks like a glass of grapefruit juice. Very cloudy, yellow. No head. After the Eccentric Ale, this is another extremely flavorful beer. High in alcohol and lots of hops.  Nectar of the gods good.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1160,"2004-09-02",3.9,"Festival tap:  The crowds around Bells booth were enormous and eager to try everything. Luckily I caught almost all of the specials, like this overhopped, syrupy IIPA.  What malts tried to balance the onslaught of hops where sweet and somewhat toasty, the hops were massively rindy and bitter.  I liked the huge grapefruit aftertaste and obvious alcohol kick at the finish!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
1160,"2004-08-15",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2006 2004 Great Taste of the Midwest. Couldy and bright orange/yellow with a good white head. Flowery and bright citrus and fruity hop aroma. A bit of creamy/oily feel to it. Citrus and flowery hop taste, dominated by sweet and fruity lemons. A great IIPA version. (7 / 4 / 8 / 4 / 16)
Update 2006-11-17 - Tastes less exotic, but still great. Piney green hops, standard IIPA mouthfeel, great balance. Very hoppy, more so than malty, but done well.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
1160,"2004-06-12",3.6,"Super pinappley- mango, very very tropical. Slight metallic notes. Im going to have to disagree with Brad here and suggest that this isnt complex enough to compete with Dread or (especially) Hop Wallop or Avery 11 - unless you love the big fruit and dont go for earthy, iron components.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1160,"2004-06-11",4.2,"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe.  This is a beer for hopheads and it was inevitable considering the popularity of both this ""extreme"" style and the brewers regular IPA, Two-Hearted Ale.  While most I2PAs follow the tried-and true grapefruit/pine balanced by caramely malt formula, this example is unique and extraordinary.  Hopslam was served in a snifter/tulip and had an unusually opaque peach/orange color, topped by a thin-medium off-white head.  The aroma first caught my attention- strong pineapple, pepper, and fruit juice.  The flavor is marked by abundant pineapple (including a bit of acidity), pepper, resin, and sweet, fruity malt.  Extremely creamy and potent, Hopslam finishes with a nice bitterness and a touch of alcohol.  I suspect Centennial hops dominate the hop bill if they dont have exclusive reign.  In fact, this seems like an amped-up version of Two-Hearted Ale, already a great beer.  Picture Two-Hearted Ale with more intense fruity, citrusy, perfumey flavors and a creamier, thicker body.  This beer is a hopheads dream and ranks up there with Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and Three Floyds Dreadnaught IPA on my list.  I cant say Ive had any beer quite like it.  Outstanding.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
