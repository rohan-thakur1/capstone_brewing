Excellent stuff again from Cloudwater, they are definitely a brewery that know how to make excellent DIPAs & this one is no exception. The beer started a little slower than Id have liked & the nose was far from as strong as previous offering but it wasnt quite week either; it did eventually open up with some nice citrus notes & the odd hop but it could definitely have been stronger. Thankfully things improved substantially come the nose & plenty of hop bitterness featured alongside strong malts & various tropical fruits to give the beer an excellent taste. Its probably not as good as some previous offering from the brewery, especially there DIPA v10 & v11 in this series but it was still a great beer & one Id have again; if only the nose was a little better then it might have been something truly special.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

To me, not worth all the fuss. The Stigbergets GBG is way better and cheaper, even though it is not even a DIPA. Ill compare it to the (un)human cannonball, because everyone seems to do so.

It almost has the mouthfeel of fruit juice, and also a little creamy or even oily if you will? Very juicy taste. It also has a larger ""hit"" of hops than the earlier versions. Piney, raw hop oily that creates a bite to it that many NE-style beers try to avoid. I think it sends this one right up to the skies as a rocket, and I wonder if it isnt the best one in the series?","Örebro, SWEDEN","Hopmaestro"

Updated Ive had this a few nights ago now but its almost calling me back yeah the aromas understated and the apperance is a tad odd but for taste Ive never had a better beer rethought 4.5","Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","redders1974"
1162,"2017-03-31",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2017 Keg at Hop Locker. Pours a really murky orangey gold with a white head that remains. Aroma is a really sweet juicy fruit bomb. Mango and pineapple with some dank pine notes. Taste is really sticky sweet juicy tropical fruits with a sharp hoppiness and pine finish
Really easy drinking and really good stuff.
Can at home to review this. If anything its better with a little age. Still got the really juicy fruit with a bitter Hoppy finish. Uprated a little as its great stuff.","Surrey, ENGLAND","WingmanWillis"
1162,"2017-03-31",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2017 Keg at Hop Locker. It pours murky orange milkshake action with a thick, dense white head. The aroma is rich, sweet, very juicy, creamy, papaya, mango, passion fruit, pine needles, brioche, fruit pie, dank, green hops, spring onion and chive. The taste is rich, decent hit of bitterness (more so that precious iterations), creaminess, very ripe tropical fruits, juicy, papaya, mango, dried apricot, grapefruit, dank, pine needles, grassy, weed, spring onion, light astringency, bit of spice and some mellow alcohol warmth with a drying finish. Medium body and moderate, foamy carbonation. More bitterness and I would say complexity to this iteration. Perhaps a bit more body also. Very enjoyable stuff. Not quite as good as birthday, but still pretty exceptional. Original rating - 9 - 4 - 8 - 4 - 17 (4.2). Re - rate from can. This really has a great depth of flavour. Plenty going on, yet it has brilliant balance and high drinkability. Upped to 9 - 4  - 9 - 4 - 18 (4.4).","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
