4439,"2014-07-15",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2014 Bottle: 38/360. Thanks, Nolan. The color of a ruby red grapefruit, deep & nearly opaque, topped with a slightly lavender tinted foam that fizzles to a collar. Aroma is sour right up front. Ripe, sour cherries dipped in lactic acid. Acidity in the form of cherry skin & lemon with a softer, juicy cherry flesh sweetness bringing up the rear. Very lovely cherry flavor, juicy & pure with a souring quality that instantly puckers the lips. Cherry fresh, lemon, mild acidity, & heaps of sour lacto. A little bit of that almost cinnamon-y spice that I get from certain cherry beers. Dry finish, kiss of woodiness & drying cherry flavor. Would have liked some more funk, but nevertheless: a simply delicious fruited American wild ale.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

The aroma has some sharp mineral acidity with a TON of old cheese and a little strawberry and cherries. The flavor is light and airy with some rich cherry and cheesy funk. Nice tartness that stops short of being sour. Pretty light on the palate for the ABV with a nice bretty, cherry finish. Good stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
