3721,"2013-04-13",3.6,"A not bad irish ale released near St. Patties. Amber in color, thick and creamy. Some bread and caramel in the flavor and a bit of mellow hoppiness.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
3721,"2013-03-28",3.5,"On tap at the brewery.  Comes reddish orange with a nice biege head.  Aroma of malt, caramel, and grain.  Taste is malt, caramel, grain, a bit of smoke, and a bit of hops.  Very enjoyable.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
3721,"2013-03-22",3.5,"Pours a translucent amber with a large foamy very light tan lacing head.  Aroma of nuts, toffee and toasted cereal grains.  Flavor really showcases a nice fresh lightly toasted cereal grain maltiness, some toffee and light caramel notes.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
3721,"2012-03-09",3.6,"On tap @ Free State Brewery. A nice red color with a bubbly tan head. A light  aroma of toasty malts with a bit of sweetness. The taste is sweet and malty with a nice buttery mouthfeel.

3721,"2011-03-20",3.4,"On tap @ Free State. Red orange appearance. Slightly creamy amber malty nose. Nice Irish amber flavor.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
3721,"2009-04-05",3.0,"Malty. A heavy beer for its size. Im getting some scottish taste to this, but not enough to turn me off. A nice seasonal to have in March.","Raymore, Missouri, USA","randolphjj"
3721,"2008-04-26",3.7,"Draught @ Brewpub:  Interesting pour.  It has a bit of the Guinness-like cascade going on with it.  It pours a coppery-amber color, which ended up being almost clear.  Needless to say, it ended up with a decent size off-white head that leaves some lacing.  There is a hint of roastiness to the nose.  Earthy, grassy hops predominate the aroma, with some caramel also.  It has a decent malt body, with a slightly dry taste.  Very little sweetness to it.  This is a very good beer!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
3721,"2008-03-28",3.6,"Growler shared with theisti. Pours reddish-brown with a thin skin of off-white head. On the nose are: caramel, flowers and a faint peat note in the background. Light to medium-bodied and slick with a clean, lightly dry finish. This one tastes like a blend of about two-thirds Irish ale (caramel malt base) and one-third Scottish ale (peaty smoked malt). This is a solid and tasty session beer.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
3721,"2008-03-26",3.4,"Growler generously shared by Gregis. Pour is clear orange amber with an off white 1 inch head. Some pretty lacing on the glass. Aroma of malty, earthy, floral hop with some distant sweetness - brown sugar. Taste has the smokiness from the nose, but none of the sweetness. Some bitter, almost ear waxy hoppiness to the body / finish. This was interesting, nicely made.  Thanks for bringing this one over, Greg!","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3721,"2008-03-13",3.9,"From a growler.  Pour deep garnet red with a rich light tan head.  Yeast drived fruity esters, biscuity and caramel malts in the nose.  Big biscuit and caramel malt flavor with some berry like yeast flavors.  You can taste a little bit of roasted barley.  Mellow bitterness.  Fuller body.  Avarage carbonation.  This is exactly what I want in an Irish ale.  Thanks to csbosox for picking this up for me.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
3721,"2007-04-01",3.8,"Fresh growler courtesy of phillybeer2112.  Pours brown with a fair thin head that takes a while to subside.  Smells of tealike hops, roses, caramel and some spice.  Tastes of spice, rich malt, some coffee hints and nutty.  Mouthfeel is thin and semi-sweet.  Finish is tangy with hints of sweet malt.  This is a well balanced very sessionable ale.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3721,"2007-03-20",2.6,"On tap at the brewpub. Poured amber with a dirty white head. Aroma was really lacking. I didnt sense much except a slight hint of chocolate. Flavor was the same as the aroma. Medium body with a slightly dry finish. This beer defines average.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"
3721,"2006-03-20",3.4,"On Tap: Pours a copper red color with a little lacing and carbonation meandering its way towards the top.  Little to no head, but it may have been gone by the time it was brought all the way to my table.  The aroma wasnt particularly strong, mear weak in fact, but it was plesant.  Some definite malts characteritcs, caramel/toffee.  The flavor was sweet malts, caramel, and maybe a touch of earthy tones (grass).","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","KUEric"
3721,"2005-03-14",3.6,"(Tap at brewery)  Pours a deep amber body with a small white head.  Aroma of caramel and malt.  Flavor of malts, fruit, and caramel.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3721,"2005-03-12",3.2,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2005 Thin head with a beautiful red body. The aroma is malty and smoky with some corn. Also hints of grass. The taste is mild with grass and some tobacco. A decent version of the style. Would make for a decent session beer.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
3721,"2003-03-13",4.1,"Loved the color. A very good representation of the style I think, not too sweet of a caramel note and a restrained earthiness as well.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
3721,"2001-03-25",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2006 Pretty tasty interpretation of the Irish Ale.  Garnet color and nice malty smoothness, but still somewhat light-bodied and not bitter in any way.  Great for early springtime, straight from the tap handle or growler!","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
