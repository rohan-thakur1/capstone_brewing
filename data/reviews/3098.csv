Piana : Piana w kolorze karmelowym o super-drobnej strukturze. Bardzo trwała, puszysta i dobrze krążkująca.
Piana do ostatniego łyka piwa pozostaje na szkle , a nawet jeszcze po wypiciu na jego dnie. 
Zapach : W pierwszych niuchach mocna paloność, potem lekko wędzony charakter.
Minimum czekolady i trochę kawy. 
Smak: Początkowo słodko-czekoladowy, który wkrótce zmienia się w bardziej wytrawny z charakterystyczną kawową kwaskowością.
Paloność i wędzone nuty trochę mniej widoczne.
Piwo jest ekstrymalnie gęste, jak czarna, ciekła smoła.
Goryczka wytrawna, krótka, średnio mocna. 
Wysycenie: Średnie. 
Podsumowanie: 

Austriacki Browar BeVog jest chyba moim pierwszym browarem craftowym z tego kraju.
Bardzo dobry start i pierwsze piwo z tego browaru, które trafiło do mojego szkła.
Okazało się to bardzo błogim doświadczeniem.
Co jest najważniejszym jego walorem?
Jego gęsta, smolista konsystencja i czekoladowo-kawowy charakter.

Lovely smokey aroma, but theres a chocolatiness that is prepared to play tug of war with the smoke. Black, small brief tight head. A 4+ look, but as the label is fantastic Ill give a ""like the look of the bottle"" boost to overall. Palate pleasantly not too heavy, robust porter nails the style. Nice balance of roast and smoke, but doesnt quite nail it. Burntness and bitterness make the palate a little aggressive at times. Finish dry and burnt, and bitter.

3098,"2014-03-17",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2014 
Look: Light pour with beautiful, huge, thick (very small bubbles), billowy, mocha head. Very slow but good looking retention (mountains; slow breakdown of large bubbles), leaves quite some sticky lacing when it goes down and a creamy top layer awaits at the end. Clear, dark brown, but cant really see through. Looks good. 


Smell: Most dominant is a very smooth, charcoal smoke with light bacon. Malt presence combines light sweetness from mostly milk chocolate and light roast, coffee. Also some herbal hop freshness with wood and mineral, maybe a bit of vanilla. Smoothness of the smoke is impressive. 


Taste: Roast rises a bit, hints of dark fruit esters and light sour keeps it fresh. Medium dark malt sweetness, mostly milk chocolate with some caramel, roast and smokiness in the middle. It goes to charcoal smoke, roast and dark coffee medium bitterness + light noble hops. Bitterness stays for a while. Also some caramel and chocolate sweetness linger on the lips when the time goes by.


Mouthfeel: Heavier medium body, very creamy feeling with gentle carbonation. Well done. Leaves a dry, coating finish.

This is definitely better fresh, when its more varied. The two years old bottle is much more dominated by the smoke, especially in the finish.

3098,"2013-08-12",4.3,"Bottled, 0.33l. Murky dark brown, almost black, color with large creamy light brown mostly lasting head, fair lacing and many tiny yeast particles. Aroma of heavily roasted malt, smoke, strong coffee, dark chocolate, mild caramel, light resiny hops and mild vegetables. Taste starts light sweet malty with heavy roasty and smokey notesy, then followed sourish grainy. Finish is moderate to heavy bitter, aftertaste is long spicy roasted and with some bitterness, too. Full body, creamy texture and soft carbonation in palate. Excellent complementary addition to smoked sausage or salami, but would be very careful when combining it with smoked bananas...","Koper, SLOVENIA","Kita"

3098,"2013-07-06",3.9,"Ogis. Black tinged with amber, something like extremely dark amber. Who cares. Lasting off white/beige head that wnet away slowly. Smoked ham aroma, coffee to bacon. The taste is... wow. Smoked chocolate if such a thing existed, some bitterness. Fresh, nicely smooth and a bunch of other minor details that I cant decypher. Lovely lovely stuff.
