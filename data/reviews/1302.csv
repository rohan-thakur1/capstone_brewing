Pours dark brown color with a very small head. Very strong aroma of bourbon and vanilla, roasted malts, alcohol is very much present, subtle syrupy sweetness. Flavor is toasted malty, licorice, bourbon and caramel, subtle vanilla, alcohol comes through a bit too much here so the body could be a bit sturdier with malt.

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, wood, vanilla, chocolate, mocha, roasted malts and smoke.

Starts heavy sweet with malts, caramel, wood, vanilla, chocolate and mocha; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts and smoke.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. The aroma might not be that strong, the flavour definitely is. Amazing barrels it aged on, together with a very roasted base beer. Great appearance and palate as well, slightly weird that the aroma is so slight.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
