4595,"2015-04-17",3.9,"미노브루어리-& 5%ABV 따자마자 비릿한 밀맥주풍 과일향, 잔에 따르면 탁한 백색효모가 천천히 황금빛 맥주에 섞인다. 바디에서 테일까지 줄곧 감도는 가벼운 유자향.코리엔& 차분한 봄날의맥주 약한 거품, 여과하지 않아 다소 두꺼운 질량감의 텍스트, 테일에만 살짝 어쩔수 없다는듯 쳐주는 크리스피하고 호피한질감. 네가티브한 찝찔한 뒷끝이나 잡내는 전혀없다. 자연스러움을 즐기는 내겐 장점이자 단점.

4595,"2015-02-21",3.6,"On tap at Vector Beer in Shinjuku. Served in a shaker pint. Nice hazy yellow color with a modest white head. Yuzu aroma is strong and out in front of coriander and pepper. The yuzu really stands out on the palate and the pepper comes out as the beers settles into room temperature. Very light and refreshing on the palate with a nice dry crisp finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

Taste is very smooth, yuzu flavour is much more subtle compared with some other brews I have had. Body is a bit weak but overall, nice and very drinkable beer.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
4595,"2014-02-14",3.9,"Bottle from the National Brewery Centre, Burton. Cloudy golden orange beer with large foamy head and some lacing. Aroma of oranges, coriander and some spice. Taste pretty much follows suit, nice mix of orange and coriander along with softer pineapple notes and a little spice. I dont know what Yuzu is but I imagine its in there somewhere. Good stuff.","West Bromwich (Yorkshire Expat), West Midlands, ENGLAND","SarkyNorthener"
4595,"2014-02-09",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2014 Draught at Beer Belly. Murky, cloudy body,nice white head. Lots of fruit, wheat and some spice in the aroma. Mostly yuzu fruit flavour, with some banana, cloves and wheat. Very drinkable, good thirst quencher.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
4595,"2013-04-25",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Bursting lime-like yuzu fruitiness dominates this lean, juicy offering.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the cloudy yellowish white.
-The yuzu use is nicely aromatic, but there isnt much beer to be tasted underneath.
-Drinkability is sky high, but thats the case for most fruit juices as well.
-Carbonation was low, made of tiny bubbles.

4595,"2013-01-01",3.7,"Draft at Craft Beer Base. An excellent beer. It is a nice spicy white with yuzu flavors woven into it. I agree with maekchu, it has definitely gotten better with a nicer balance of flavors. If you have the chance it is worth trying out.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
4595,"2012-12-29",3.8,"Draught at Yellow Ape Craft. Great estery apple and banana aroma. Cloudy pear juice color. Light fruity initial (pears and peaches); mid gains some tang  and sweetness, along with mild wheat notes; goes out very smoothly. Thin-medium body. Yuzu is present but not very strong. Very gentle, lovely stuff. Theyve gotten better at making this one.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
4595,"2012-07-13",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2014 Keg at the Watering Hole. Hazy pale blond colour with small white head. Aroma is wheaty and grainy with a touch of creaminess. Some fruity citrus there too and a bit of delicate spiciness. Maybe white pepper. Taste is nice and wheaty at the start and then the yuzu citrus comes in. Slightly lime-like. Bit of belgian yeastiness too. Slight prickle in the mouth. Very refreshing and crisp. Perfect for the heat.
Tried again in the winter, and found it not so exciting this time. Maybe its a weather thing. Marks will meet half way.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
