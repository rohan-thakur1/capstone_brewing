3499,"2016-07-12",3.3,"Bottle from Ales by Mail, consumed at home. Murky light brown. Looks dishwater-esque. And pretty flat. Smells lovely though: fresh hazelnut with a light dusting of chocolate. Caramel and toffee. Tastes sweet and gooey. Theres a hoppy bite near the end - and a surprisingly bitter aftertaste - but my overall impression is sweet. Way, way too much alcohol in the finish. I get used to it after a while, and I have to remember that its not really a mind (well its not, is it?) and sip slowly. Enjoyable but the over-the-topness doesnt do it any favours.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

3499,"2015-12-20",3.7,"Crafty interpretation of English dark mild at 8.1% - referring to the fact that originally, mild ale was not synonymous with low alcohol ale, but with fresh ale as opposed to old ale; in a modern day beer geek context, I guess this could be described as an imperial mild... Remarkably loose, irregular, thin, greyish white head retaining only on the edges, colour is a beautiful brownish deep purple, quadrupel-like and clear, fitting perfectly for this time of the year. Aroma of overripe pear, soft bourbon, milk chocolate, a lot of FFF (freshly fermented farmland - read manure), hazelnuts, damp forest floor, mouldy orange, Rioja wine, raisins, butterscotch, stewed beef - in all, richer and more complex than usual for a dark mild, with the aromas being pushed forward by the alcohol. Clean, soft onset of candied fig and cherry sweetness with elderberry sourishness and light beefy umami, soft carbo, very smooth and lean body, emphatic caramel maltiness, nutty and a tad chocolatey too, leaving a resiny coating of bittersweetness; finishes with well-positioned earthy and herbal hop bitterness nicely balancing the caramel sweetness. Flavours of this earthy hop bitterness and bittersweet toasted malts in the end are reinforced by a glow of warming, port-like alcohol. If I had to taste this blind, I would never have associated it with mild ale, this is in fact much closer to an old ale - but again, in the modern sense of the word. Too bad for the strong manure-like odour, but this fades away after a while and in the mouth, this beer shows dignity and balance so in the end, I would still recommend it, if only for the unusual premise.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Pours dark red-brown color with a very small, rapidly dissipating head. Aroma is ripe with fruits and sweet with caramel and malts, some faint berry notes accompanied by subtle chocolaty notes, not that much hops here. Alcohol is clearly present also. Sweet malty flavor with plums and some mild spices, maybe some distant honey on the background. Palate is quite smooth with soft carbonation and a sticky sweet finish, some alcohol burn as well.

3499,"2015-01-12",3.9,"Bottle. Instantly this smells like a typical abbey or trappist beer, very malty and sweet notes, some hops as well as some spices. The initial taste reflects the nose, heavy malty beer with a nice sweetness, some spices and slightly bitter aftertaste. The hops came more through as the beer warmed up it seemed, or maybe I was the trappisteish taste that pulled my leg. Overall its difficult to say what this beer actually is, a heavy on the malts DIPA? A trappiste high on hops? A hybrid between the two? Great beer in my opinion.","Oslo, NORWAY","Smaskifa"
