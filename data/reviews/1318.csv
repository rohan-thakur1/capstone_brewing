1318,"2013-08-30",3.8,"50cl bottle thanks to Anthony. This is an ale that definitely is in the Scottish tradition. The extra level of alcohol has brought out a rich raisin aroma and taste and there is just enough freshness on the finish to make you want more - shame I ended up sharing this one.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
1318,"2013-08-30",4.1,"Bottle shared at home. Pours dark red-brown with a thick creamy head. Big malt and raisin aromas, luscious. Nuts and biscuit also. Caramel and toffee. Lovely subtle balancing bitterness to all that malt-sweet. A stunning beer.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","allmyvinyl"

1318,"2013-05-01",3.8,"bottle at home from alesela
 pours clear deep ruby-garnet with a light off-white crema of a head, giving off a nose redolent of an autumn trek through a forest, with red berries, damp soil and crunchy leaves. The body is fairly full, yet light, with gentle carbonation. Its fairly rich, with a big booze hit up front, slightly astringent burnt toast malt and plenty of dried fruit sweetness afterwards in a long fruity finish.","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"

Aroma of rich caramel malts, quite rich soft toffee, touch of doughy malt, soft dark fruits, some raisin, mainly rich malts
Taste of smooth malts, rich dark caramel, rich toffee, soft raisin, dough, alcohol very well hidden
Palate - soft to medium carb, medium body, smooth texture. Finish as main flavour, smooth rich caramel, light roast

1318,"2012-12-28",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2014 Drunk via cask at the Hanging Bat December 21st.

Another palate pleaser with a mouthfeel and taste like no other. Exactly what Rich has said below. Except it seems I liked it more. WIthout a doubt the best Scottish Old Ale brewed at any time in living memory.

Bottle on 02/02/14.
Wonderfully alive deep with great depth of flavour & complexity.  Lovely restrained smoky quality.  Could be confused as a collaborative beer with Schlenkerla. Mmmm. Unassuming, great value and puts most £10 and above craft bottles to shame.","SCOTLAND","zimbo"
1318,"2012-12-20",3.9,"[cask at the Hanging Bat, Edinburgh] Dark mahogany reddish-brown, thick tan head. Sweet caramel and chocolate aroma, touch of booze. Tastes sweet, rich and warming - molasses, prunes, raisins, caramel, before finishing warm and with a touch of alcohol on the finish.
