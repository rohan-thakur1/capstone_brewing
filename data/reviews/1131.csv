1131,"2014-12-12",4.3,"Yields a sunny-yellow color, with a one finger broad, bubbly head.

The aromas reveal a tart sourness among wheat notes. It got an almost sweeter sparkling wine character with a noteable barrel infusion to it, which then turns into a more acidic direction. It picks up on the lactic chardonnay characteristic very well, the resulting tartness comes almost naturally to mind. The nose gets completed by hints of white lemon peel, adding a refreshing, fruity aspect.

While the sourness from the aromas was very well integrated into a complex interplay of smells, it shines through big time while tasting the beer. It rises from the sweeter, pungent sparkling wine qualities to unfold on the palate with an almost tongue numbing dryness. The sweeter aspect doesnt vanish from one moment to the other, but evolves during drinking and turns from sweet to sour, while the lively, soft carbonation turns visible. Funkiness is very well integrated, adding depth to the chardonnay lactic acid, without being recognizable on its own, otherwise defined by its typical barnyard qualities. Due to the high carbonation, the mouthfeel is almost sprizzy, fizzy - another well inserted sparkling wine aspect.

I am impressed, that this is still easily recognizable as a beer, while it features very thoughtful and effectively integrated sparkling wine constituents. Malts and hops play an important role, as they prevent the beer from becoming too sweet and fizzy. The subtle musty and earthy additions do the same, convincing me this is still beer. Finishes quite refreshing with a faint lemon fruitiness and an almost bitter, punching, dry sourness. This is incredibly complex and very convincing.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Tartish woody nose with lots of sour fruity elements. White currants, sharp sorrel, bitter orange peel, almost a little tropical in a way? It smells absolutely lovely non the less. Really flavorful also! Oh, yeah. It has a nice oily feeling in the mouth and its spot on the carbonation. The first thing I get in the taste is dried apricots. Ill actually call it super-fruity this. The sourness is just perfectly balanced between the tart woody, the fruity sweet and and the sharp vinegar - stingy.

Temptation - Russian River 
BA wild ale 
7.5% ABV 

APPEARANCE: Pours a kings crown gold with a brilliant star-bright glow coming from the bottom of the glass. Small thin white soapy head that dissipates into a halo that stays the entire time I'm drinking. 

AROMA: Beautiful bouquet on this beer, huge sour tartness initially with loads of lemon and hay blended together. Perfectly ripe green apples, grapes, white wine notes and oakiness. 

TASTE: My taste buds are playing celestial trumpets. A perfect marriage of sweet and sour. Like drinking a Chardonnay with lemon zest on top. Sour grapes and slightly sweet grassy notes. Nice faint flavors of barrel and malt. 

MOUTHFEEL: Light plus body with a medium dancing carbonation. Funky, dry long lasting finish. 

OVERALL: This beer was the perfect outside right before sunset 75 degree choice. Super refreshing and easy drinking. I am just starting to explore into the world of sours, out of all the RR sours I've had this is by far my favorite.

Powerful, Belgian-esque, fresh, sour, fruity aroma features a crabapple scent. Excellent and appetizing sour smell. Pours an effervescent golden with a small amount of beige head. It looks as it should, but Im not going to award such an ordinary appearance particularly high marks.

1131,"2013-10-12",4.2,"Bottled May 30, 2013 (~4 months old).
Appearance: The body is beautifully clear with a golden sparkling body, the head is tall but thin and foamy with poor retention. The head settles into a white foamy coating.
Aroma: Brett is here, providing its signature funk that reminds me light barnyard aromas, tart lemon, and dry leather. I smell a prominent peach aroma that comes off mildly tart, but slightly sweet, along with green apples, with a subtle sweetness hidden in the background. This smells lovely, complex and inviting with a moderate presence.
Taste: The first sip comes off mildly sweet, with a dry, tart and fruity presence, lemons and leather come to mind. The intro reminds me of sweet peaches with mild overlying funk, accented by sour peach and lemon. The finish is mildly tart of green apple that finishes out nicely. Light oak notes add a dryness and a light vanilla presence on the finish, boy this is nice. The finish is dry and rather abrupt, leaving a slight acidity.Palate: Medium bodied and effervescent.
Overall: This is a great beer and I think that its drinking pretty near harmonious now. I think much longer would add too much Brett characteristic, while earlier may be a little too tame. I hope to try this again, I really enjoy it.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

1131,"2013-09-06",4.6,"This was one of those rare and perfect beers. 

Pours a clear, vibrant gold color with a pretty orange hue. Streaming effervescence. Looks like a glass of white wine or champagne except for the fat head of white foam. Delicate, tight bubbles that cling to the glass and fall off slowly to a cap and thick ring. Couldnt be any prettier. 

Nose is chardonnay wine. Has a nice crisp wine like scent with a touch of sour lemon. Brett and barnyard. Wet grass. The nose has just a touch of the oak and a dryness from the brett that also seems to be a little sour. The malt is faint on the nose and not much more than a breath of biscuit. As it warms the lemon becomes a little sweeter. 

Taste is divine. Its tart and sour. The mouth waters from the first sip. it tastes of the chardonnay and oak. The bubbles make it sparkle on the tongue. It has a mineral quality and a its a little edgy too. Bold and daring. The malt is light, fluffy and biscuity bread. The drink is dry and warming. So fruity, so juicy. 

This is one of the best beers you will have. The chardonnay character and the brett go so well together. The oak is understated but adds depth and the malt is superbly light. Crisp, fresh, billowing and ample. This is a beer you can linger over and really appreciate its indulgence.","New York, USA","pinkie"

A - Slightly hazed golden body with a bright white head.

S - Sweet grapes, green apples, tart berries, lots of dry dusty wood, lemons, some grassy potpourri spices that remind me of a hobby lobby. The brett and chardonnay aroma really starts taking over as it warms.

T - Tart grapes, crisp green apples, and lemon dance on the tongue creating a nice crisp tartness. A light dusty funk appears mid palate finishing crisp and tart with some snappy lemon acidity.

M - Light body, effervescent carbonation that turns smooth at the end, nice tartness with a crisp dry finish.

Medium to smaller sized white to off white head on top of a clear yellow colored beer.
Smell brett, wild yeast, ash, fruits like apricot, sulphur, cellar and a nice wet stone.
Taste is good and pretty complex mix of: good tart with some hints of yeast, chalk, grapes, berries, cellar, apricot, wet stone, wild yeast.
Aftertaste is light tart with some grains and yeast.
Low carbo, watery light creamy mouthfeel, good medium to lightly fuller body and a light creamy texture.

A - Pours an initially clear golden amber body. The second pour is obviously quite hazy with some sediment. Massive fluffy bone white head fills the rest of the glass but dies down quickly leaving behind a gorgeous one finger cap. Sticky and soapy lacing with long retention coats the glass after every sip. 

S - Starts off with huge notes of brettanomyces. Barnyard musk, hay, and oak. Layers of fruit; mainly lemons, overripe pears and grape skins. The finish is powdery and dry with a touch of blue cheese. The white wine barrel adds such a great fruit character. Just phenomenal. 

T - Crisp and lively. Sour lemons, ripe pear juice, and tart green grapes. Oak and a musk take over on the finish. Lactic and very tart. Finishes nearly dry. Not over the top sour.

M - Medium bodied with high carbonation. Drinks very easily.

O - Very nice AWA. The aroma is just perfect. Definitely draws some parallels with brett heavy Belgian Pales and the Chardonnay barrel adds a subtle but well implemented angle.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

1131,"2012-12-07",4.0,"Draft at Bigwood 12/6/12 [5 of 11].
Aroma: belgian golden ale, yeast, malty sweetness. Like a dubbel with extra spices (nutmeg, cloves). 
Appearance: pale gold. One finger worth of nice frothy white head. Crystal clear. Nice but irregular lacing. 
Taste: big sour up front (unexpected from aroma). Followed by noticeable hop bitterness before giving way to a sweeter finish in line with aroma. The transition is jarring, and not as harmonious as I've come to expect from RR.
Palate: medium body, nice carbonation. 
Overall: this is still pretty great, but isn't in the same league as the others (1-4) I'm tasting side-by-side. 

Note from Nick: ""this is the best thing to ever come out of a chardonnay barrel. Write that down.""

Opened right after work.  Mail-order beer.  Nose reminds me of berliner weisse? But additional Brett and a touch of Chardonnay.  Very pleasant.  

Pale gold - looks gorgeous.  Seems super carbonated yet a nice light head.  Interesting how bubbles come up directly from the center of bottom of glass?  this actually does look like the champagne of beers

Taste is wheat, lemon grass and a tiny bit of funk up front...quickly followed by this lovely explosion of Brett and Chardonnay.  Im not even a huge chard fan, but this is the perfect amount of winey oak in the taste.  Very refreshing and in my opinion the perfect amount of tartness.

1131,"2012-03-01",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed2/12/2011.  Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a tulip. Batch 05X1E.

With a slow pour to keep the yeast sediment out, Temptation pours a golden yellow color, slightly hazy with a modest white head. The head retains nicely and leaves a thick sheet of lace all the way down the glass.

Some barnyard funk, tons of oak, and great tart golden fruits open up the aroma. Tart apples, pear, and white grape are all present. A bit of grassy hops close out the nose.

The sour flavors kick in right away. Sour green apple is the first flavor on the tongue, along with white grape. A huge acidic oaky flavor, from the Chardonnay barrels, complements the grape well. The Bretty funk and sour character builds and takes control after a brief grassy hop flavor toward the end of the sip. The finish is very sour, and the sour flavor lingers.

This definitely causes me to salivate profusely and my cheeks to pucker. Mostly crisp with a subdued smooth creaminess contained in the medium carbonation. The body feels a bit above medium. The oak definitely makes its presence known, and it is somewhat dry and quite acidic.

This is one of my first ventures into the realm of the true sours, and I enjoyed the trip. The nose and flavor are complex and interesting, and this may lead to a new obsession. The candidly sour flavor will not let you down this quickly, but it will be a fun glass.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

The aroma was harsh of a grain malt and a funky moldy yeast (Brett) with notes of peach, pears, lemon and a winey oak scent.

The taste was slightly sweet and tart with a note of peach in the beginning then quickly got extremely sour with a big dose of citrus and a hint of wine and wood at the end.

1131,"2011-11-07",3.9,"I poured a 375ml corked and caged bottle into a champagne flute.

Appearance: Champagne or lager-like complexity of bright white gold with massive carbonation bubbles present. Forms a good sized white foamy head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: White grape, straw, sour candy. 

Taste: A lot of people wave a flag on drinkers like me that enjoy overly sweet flavored stouts and other beers because theyre basically just liquid candy. But cant the same be said for sours? Drinking Russian River Temptation is like drinking liquid sour candy like Sour Patch Kids. Its very sour, tart, sweet, refreshing and delicious. I guess these types of beers get a pass because theyre made with ""wild"" yeast which have to be handled with care. Plus this beer was aged in French Chardonnay oak barrels (although I get no wood character from this beer).

It begins with immediate sourness - sharp and to the point. Theres a subtle sweetness through the middle with a fruity-like taste of white grape. Then it transitions back to its sour edge, turning more towards tartness like an unripe grape or berry. Its an interesting and fun mix of sourness and sweetness with a short, but intense sour aftertaste which lingers for a little while and builds up by the time you finish the bottle.

Mouthfeel: Thin, crisp with extremely fine carbonation tingling. Leaves a sugary aftertaste of sourness and seems to numb the tongue.

Drinkability: For an overtly sour beer, bottle-conditioned and highly effervescent, Russian River temptation is remarkably easy to drink. The flute glass helps concentrate it to the middle of the tongue instead of the entire mouth and no carbonation gets stuck in the throat. It goes down smooth, although there is a dry aftertaste. The 7.5% seems right on the money. On one hand it has the robustness of something stronger; but on the other hand it drinks and feels like an even lighter beer. Nice to see an American sour that is comparable to the Belgians.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Kind of like white grapes. A champagne smell maybe, no hints of alcohol. Semi-sweet.

Taste:
More of that sourish white grape flavor, with hints of orange peel and lemony citrus. Its like a sour candy! Lots of character in this one. Slightly sweet malt flavor, definitely sour instead of bitter. Id call it delicious.

Mouthfeel:
Thicker than I was expecting, and it kind of washes over your mouth and sticks to you. It leaves a bubbly sour film, which slowly slips away, leaving you feel like youve just eaten sour candy.

Drinkability:
Reasonably high. Due to the price and sourness (my tongue starts to hurt after too much sour), I couldnt drink several of them, but on the right night, I can definitely drink one and really enjoy it.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

It pours a brilliant yellowish orange with a nice foamy white head that leaves some nice lacing.

The smell is bretty and fruity. It isnt that potent of a smell though. I am getting a faint bit of pineapple and a faint sourness. There is also a bit of malt. Odd that I cant really smell this one, might just be me.

The flavor is nice though. It is not really sour but bretty. the brett shines in this brew, if you like it then you will like this brew. A bit of funk and lemon paired with a nice malt and a hit of oak and wine bill complete this brew.

A - Pours pale yellow with a spotty white head leaving minimal lacing down the glass. Quite pale but very inviting.

S - Strong sour notes up front with a bit of sweetness. Some lemon, white grape, and a few other earthy notes. The sourness is strong but not overpowering.

T - Tart up front slowly giving way to bright citrus flavors, similar to the nose, finishing with a lingering biternes that fades after a short time. A very nice wild ale, tart but not overpowering. My favorite of the three.

M - Medium body and head with moderate carbonation. Overall dry feel with a good amount of sourness in the finish, not lingering on the pallet for very long.

It has a nice dry finish that is really refreshing.  Palate is dead on...light to medium body with a dry crisp finish.  Makes this beer as good as it is.

1131,"2011-02-26",4.2,"Pours a cloudy golden hue with a huge, tight head that is slow to subside and leaves a generous amount of lacing on the glass.
Woody sour fruit. A little an ale is hiding deep in there. And a bit of a yeast can be barely noticed. A little fusel - fermented hot?
Sweet on the tip of the tongue, sour on the back and a little rough on the throat. The sourness definitely dominates and drowns out some of the aromas I picked up earlier. A little woodiness is present, but not much. After a few sips the sourness dies down on the taste and the underlying ale can be perceived, if ever so slightly. A little sweetness starts in at this stage.
High carbonation makes it a little thinner than it ought to be. The sour bomb lingers on for, what seems like, forever. Nice. A little on the dry side, due to carb level and sourness I would imagine.
Very quaff-able. I dont think I would have too much of a problem drinking this all evening. Well blended flavors make it a real crisp, palate-pleasing drink. If not for the ABV this could be a great session beer. Excellent.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"
1131,"2011-02-25",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2013 Comparison of Batch 1, 3, 4, and 5 12/4/10

Batch 5-fair bit of hops, juicy, hints of soap with notes of leathery brett up front. som dry oak, dustry, very light chardonney wine flavor.  juicy dry oak, bright white grapes and slightly sour with a fairbit of grassy hops and some juicy citrus.

Batch 4-more sublte than 5, chardonney comes out slightly more and the hops are much more mild.  flavors of integrated oak, white grapes, light brett presence and faint hops.

Batch 3-the hops have faded but the flavors are soft well integrated and subtle.  the chardonney barrels really make a bright presence, juicy white grapes as the brett comes in behind.  the brett is slightly sharp but still leans towards subtlty with some lemon and soft peach flavors in the back.

Batch 1-the brett has started to dominate and take over, the chardonney and juicy wine flavors have become much light and the sweetness now resides behind and underneath the strong brett presence.

1131,"2011-02-01",4.5,"Appears hazy royal gold with ample pure white fluffy, lacy-beyond-belief head that crowns the glass and stays there as a half-finger cap. Aroma is of sour melon, wood (from the oak I assume), funky yeast, floral notes, and lemon citrus. Smell keeps developing with time, with the lemon/flower scent coming through after the initial oak/melon. Taste is intoxicating, with sour light fruit initially, and a woody finish, with plenty of others in between, including yeast funk, white wine, and a tart carbonation kick throughout. Mouthfeel is fantastic, mainly due to that carbonation, as it rushes everything evenly around the palate. Beer is light while being well-bodied and leaves a nice dry coat around the mouth. Drinkability is really great for the style, probably because of how dry the finish is. This is a lot like a wine, and adds to it in so many different ways.

Pours slightly cloudy, straw-golden-bodied with a soft half-finger head that settles to a thin film-like covering. Bubbles stream upwards to the surface.

Temptation frontloads with tons of lemony citrus, green apples, green grape, and orange, following with a light, dry woodiness. The brett funkiness takes a backseat, complementing the citric acid and Chardonnay at the fore. Very clean, pungent, and rich. 

Taste is much of the same, leading with lime, green apple, and pear which lets way to hay and bretty earth notes. You can just let this sit in your mouth and let it breathe to feel its progression. Theres the tiniest hint of clove, but most of it is swallowed up by the tanginess. Temptation, as is usually the case in life, ends with a slight whimper - theres a bitterness coalescing with an almost-mute, odd mineral note. Otherwise, this one has a lot of finesse.

Palate: lemon drops from start to finish. Puckers the mouth almost immediately with a Berliner Weisse quality, most interestingly enough. Lemon infused sourdough bread. A bit simple but very refreshing. Bottle-conditioning lends to a zippy zesty playful mouthfeel which complements the lemon and scattering of white grapefruit. Slowly dries tongue and sides of cheeks.

Final Thoughts: I was initially expecting far more complexity, but she is a soured golden and thus just about right. Little evidence of farmhouse funk or the wood she was aged in lends to the overwhelming vinous sour brightness that put a smile on these lips.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1131,"2010-10-13",4.0,"Picked up a 375ml bottle at Best Damn Beer Shop in San Diego, California, and managed to wait a couple weeks before trying it...  This bottle came from batch #3.  Pours a clear, golden straw color with a small white head.  The nose here is very subtle--almost faint, but I do pick up on sour, champagne-like aromas combined with just a bit of yeasty funk coming through.  Taste is interesting; winey, of course, but also incorporating apple and lots of fruit flavors with a peculiar, woody, funky bitterness  that enters momentarily.  I have a lot to learn about sours, so perhaps its just inexperience talking here, but I really like that this beer seems a little milder and more balanced than some of the other sours Ive tried.  Its comparatively light and drinkable, with nice carbonation and a fizzy mouthfeel.  Very good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","StormCoat"

1131,"2010-10-11",4.3,"Serving: 750 ml. bottle from Hi-Time Wine Cellars. 
Aroma: The nose has a good bit of oak, Chardonnay, grass, and oddly enough what I would describe as pickle. 
Appearance: It pours a hazy gold with a foamy white head.  Good head retention. 
Taste: The first thing that strikes me about the flavor is the noticeable back bitterness.  There is a good bit of oak, some grass, a light honey that reminds me of mead and a nice tartness from the brett. 
Palate: Light in body with a high carbonation leading to a very clean finish. 
Overall: I really enjoyed the varying dimensions this brew brought to the table.  To a degree the bitterness was a bit too aggressive for my taste, but I would still highly recommend this brew.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Cork opens with huge pop, pours clear golden straw color with a whispy white head that slowly fades to the glasses edge. The nose is straw, crisp white grapes, Chardonnay tannic notes, Brett, and some saison like peppery notes. Taste is initially crisp white grapes, Chardonnay and slight pepper, transitions into a nicely soured lactic acid (not overpowering), Brett yeast (slight taste), and more white grape. What a wonderful sour ale. My second favorite from RR (behind Consecration). Glad I bought another to cellar.

Powerful but measured crisp sour dominates more vinous congeners. Incredibly ""clean"" for a naturally soured beverage -- theres just a hint of complex phenol.

1131,"2010-09-28",3.8,"The pour is a very hazy, gold color with a fairly small, white, fizzy head which actually leaves a fully lasting, frothy layer and soapy lace rings.  The nose is pleasant with a nice balance between brett tartness, oak notes, and sweet; nice brett funk and tartness, lightly spicy, light doughy notes, wet cork and oak, faint vanilla, and some muscat grapes.  The flavor is still full of brett funk, wet cork and oak, faint vanilla, still a bit spicy, but the lemon tartness begins to take over and dry out the finish; faint doughy notes and grapes in the middle.  The palate is nice with a lively carbonation, medium body, and a creamy mouthfeel but drying in the finish.  The finish is long, tart, but not quite puckering, drying, and funky with lemon and similar wet oak and cork notes.  An interesting beer pairing a Golden ale with brett and chard barrels but I had a hard time finding much of the base beer with everything else being a bit overshadowing.  I think the combination of brett, chard barrels, and Golden ale  worked well together, I just think that the brett could have been a bit less or the ABV could have been higher to accentuate the base beer a bit more.  RR always does exceptional work and this is certainly not my favorite, but still quite nice and unique.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Poured from the 1pt. 9.4 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.

The color is a glowing orange/yellow with a good amount of carbonation and three fingers of foamy white head. Some thick lacing on the glass.

The smell is funky at first. Some banana and a touch of clove. There is a green grape flavor that touches lightly on the nose and then comes back to let the sweet malt flavor shine.

The taste is like a jolly rancher or a sweet tart, very sweet and sugary that is sings in my mouth and brings about visions of green grape fun dip. It is a roller-coaster of flavors that hit me over and over and I really am amazed at how complex this beer is. Wow will not suffice.

Taste is initially more dark and sweet than sour, but then the barrels kick in, and light white grapes turn to a delicate sour flavor, far from overwhelming. A second taste confirms the unusual balance that this brew possesses.  It is indeed somewhere between a sour ale and a fine white wine,  full light light flavor and musky subtlety.  Really, the balance is incredible, though the lack of full-on sourness is, perhaps, a bit disappointing.  Still, about as high quality as it gets.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

The body on both is dark grain yellow with a nice hazyness, The crown on the 16 month version is more potent and massive and snow white. The nose is lactic with fresh peaches and hints of honey and a bit of vinegar. Its easy to drink and the 12 month version seem to be way more anonymous compared to the 16. mo that beats it on all levels. Its more sour and with a palate that is a bit more creamy and just more agressive but at the same time very balanced. Very nice brew.  The score is given for the 16 mo.

A - Pours golden in color with a fluffy white head that leaves a ton of sticky lacing behind. Lots of white fizzy bubbles remain along the top of the beer and along the edge of the glass.

S - Funky, sour, tart, and fruity. Not as ""wild"" as the Supplication or Consecration, but based upon the reviews and talk, I expected this to be less of a wild compared to other offerings by Russian River.

Smell: Extremely nice mixture of tart lemon notes, pronounced brett, white wine / green grapes, and a hint of oak. Im even getting a slightly smokey charred note from the barrel.

Taste: This ones opens with a nice tartness and continues on to show its grape / wine barrel quality, then finishes with a beautifully dry lemon drop tartness.

Pours hazy yellow-golden with an extremely lovely, creamy, weakly off-white head. Super duration - especially for a sour ale. Aroma is very pleasant, good brett, oak, green apples, light citrus, some calvados feel to it and good notes of green grapes. Great dry and slight creamy texture. Flavour is elegant, dry, tart, zesty, oak, light apple. Extremely well-balanced. Long, lingering, bretty, dry, light bitter, zesty and oaky aftertaste with light barnyard and funk.

1131,"2010-04-26",4.6,"375 ml bottle courtesy of Floydster. Batch 003. Thanks for the opportunity to try this beer..one of the priorities on my wants list! Poured into my snifter.

A- Body is a translucent golden yellow color. Pours with a solid 2-3 finger foamy white head. Leaves a lot of lacing behind in the glass and some film. When held up to the light one can see that this brew is uniform in cloudiness.

S-Nose is definitely there-but much softer than other sours I have experiences. The main characters are sour and salty-which I guess can be associated with vinegar-but I am getting more of an acidic sourness associated with a saltiness independent of that. Behind this all is a subtle sweetness that balances it all out.

T-Taste upfront is somewhat subtle and offers some tartness but there is enough of a presence of oak and granny smith apple (both tart and sweet components) flavors in the background to balance it out. The tartness comes trough some more for the finish but it is never unbearable or extreme in any way as there are some oaky characteristics that comes through as well. The finish is very clean as nothing lingers on the palate unless you lick your lips and get the moderately tart experience all over again... but I would not describe it as dry...because though there is a slight alcohol warmth it doesnt hinder the beers taste.

M-Low to medium carbonation and body that has yeasty, phenolic, acidic, salty, dry, and moist components (hard to explain but something one needs to experience).

D- This is an awesome sour/American Wild Ale by Russian River and something that I wish I would have had as a precursor to Deviation, Issabelle, and Beatification as those were all much more tart than this brew. A 375 ml serving of this is perfect and offers a lot of complexity and a great tasting experience. Russian River clearly does a great job with their sours and this one is a very balanced one. This is in its current state, IMO, the perfect introduction to sours.

1131,"2010-04-06",4.1,"750ml Bottle. Batch 004X4.  Good vapor after the pop that showed some subtle funk right from the beginning.

Also has an aroma of sour granny smith apples, chardonnay grapes and oak.  Brett comes in strong on the first sip with its usual barnyard funkiness and slowly gives way to a tart lemon zest flavor.  Body is somewhat thin with a high level of carbonation that makes the tart character of the beer stand out.  The finish lingers and is dry, crisp and lip smackingly sour. This really is a lighter sour that is more delicate than than other Russian River sours.  Only knock on this one for me is that there isnt much underneath the tart kick, was expecting some other flavors to stand out more and maybe a stronger malt profile.

The aroma is really nice showing a medley of sour lemons, chardonnay grapes, funky brett, oak, an vanilla. The nose really hints at the tartness in this one. The flavor follows with the brett showing first and adding some signature funky bitterness to go with the sour lemons and citrus fruit. The chardonnay barrels add some vinous character along with some vanilla from the oak to help balance out the sourness. The sourness isnt overpowering, but all the flavors are integrated perfectly.

S: The nose is not as overly ""green"" and tart as the servings of the newest batch have been. A nice level of Brett funk and dryness goes well with some tannic oak and a slight lactic and green apple tartness.

T: The flavor also is a bit heavier on the wild aspects and really has a nice mustiness to it. The tartness is not overpowering but provides a nice level of acidity and fruit (grapes, lemon, and apple).

M: The body feels a bit fuller than the newest batch, but that could be the high level of carbonation. The finish is nice and dry.

1131,"2010-01-10",4.2,"Batch 3, 2009 vintage.

Slightly hazy yellow color with orange hues. A pretty big ivory-colored head leaves some lacings.

A nicely sharp smell full of character. Funky horse blanket and aged cheese. Lots of tart fruits (apples, pears, lemon) and general notes of berries. Notes of fermenting apples as well. Light hints of oak barrel and a nice touch of alcohol in the background. A very impressive smell.

The taste is semi-sweet at first, but then turns rather tart. The tartness isnt really mouth-wrecking, but feels genuine and robust. A wonderful combination of pleasant fruit aromas (green apples, gooseberries, lemon) and funky notes of barnyard and mud. A hint of wood. Nice bretty flavors. In the finish, theres a mild grassy bitterness, sweet and phenolic alcohol, a gentle leafy hop note and a dry tartness.

With the last poor (I let all the yeast go into the glass) the beer changes character a bit. The tartness is muted and notes of vanilla and nuts develop.

Light body with a refreshing cider-like carbonation.

A very good wild ale. This one could probably go head to head with some of the milder Belgian gueuzes. Very refreshing and enjoyable. Impressive.

1131,"2009-09-15",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2010 I felt the need to re rate this since my appreciation for sours has grown since I first rated it. I sampled a batch 4X3 bottle side by side with a batch 3. Batch 3: Pours golden orange with a beautiful white head. Lots of streaming bubbles. The aroma is very tart and cheesy with horseblanket, grapefruit, lemon, and vanilla. I could be wrong, but I pick up slight notes of oxidation after over two years in the bottle. Some hint of sherry and nuts. Not overpowering or in any way spoiling the experience. The depth of flavor and funk is unmatched in this one. A great experience and one of the best and most interesting sours Ive had. 8:4:8:4:18= 4.2

Batch 4X3: Pour is similar to batch three, only the color is slightly lighter orange. The aroma is lemon, orange, subtle oak. The flavor is grapefruit zest and mild notes of leather and cheese. When compared to the batch 3, it tastes more spicy and less funky. Definitely dry and tart, but with a hard to pin down spiciness, almost herbal quality. (oregano, coriander, white pepper, clove?) Very subtle, and I probably would not have picked this up on its own, but next to the batch 3 I definitely noticed subtle hints. 8:4:7:4:17= 4.0

Overall the batch 3 was more interesting and earthy, funky, but the batch 4 was brighter and probably a touch more sour.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

Wow, what a great aroma; champagne, brett, chardonnay, lemon, yeast, flowers.  Flavors are tart and sour with a wonderful bretty dry numbing.  Chardonnay and oak does show in the flavor with lemon, grapes, and a bit of funk.  What an amazing beer.  Kudos to Vinnie for brewing this and to Chris for hooking me up!  Batch 3 rating 4.8.

Batch 4.  Sampled on 10/15/10.  Bottle courtesy of mkade8883.  This pours a clear golden color with a big fluffy white head.  Good retention.  The aroma is full of white grapes and a bit of funk.  This definitely resembles a white wine.  Lots of tart white grape chardonnay flavors along with oak, bretty funk, straw and some pepper.  Not quite as sour as I remember from batch 3 with some sweet citrusy fruit mixing in.  Very refreshing.  I compared this to Sanctification tonight and Ill be damned I thought Sancty was a little better.  Batch 4 rating:  4.2.

More mellow and drinkable than I was expecting actually.  Very nice stuff.

The flavor is very interesting and has a few different things going on that all comes together perfectly.  There is chardonnay and some mellow oak.

batch 003 on 5/1/09, 14 months old
Cork blew out after I put a corkscrew into it, but no beer gushed. That beautiful, shimmering, hazy golden-straw color, fluffy white head with ample lacing... beautiful. Nose is really well put together: fruit with lots of wine and brett--yeast, egg, citrus, and hints of leather. Flavor is driven by the chardonnay, all the way through the finish. More citrus and yeast, again light leather. I like this a lot, but for me the wine is too overpowering in the flavor and the dry body bordered on fizzy overkill when coupled with the heavy carbonation. Another show-stopper from RR, but not an absolute favorite. Reminiscent of JP Luciernaga. 958417

batch 003 -  on 2/5/10, 24 months old
Batch 3 out of a 375ml is incredible right now. Cork blasted out as soon as the cage was gone. The fizzy bitterness present a year ago is gone now, replaced by a tingly yet creamy soft body that is far more balanced. The marriage of elements here is practically beyond words, the complexity of the wine, brett, and wood is knee-knocking. Fuck me. 10510420

batch 003 -  on 7/20/10, 30 months oldBy now its a matter of habit to aim the cork against a solid wall, paid off again. Batch 003 is still incredible... it may even be better than at 24 months. The nose is still brilliant,  the soft marriage of brett, chardonnay, and oak still gloriously in tune. The body a bit more carbonated than I remember at 24 months, reminds of 14 months, but the flavor is a step up even from six months ago: more fresh lemon, grapeskin, lightly stinging with faintly eggy brett, chardonnay growing throwing the incredible finish before adding on some wet wood and grass, perhaps just starting to show its age with a bit of celery/plant in the back, though that could be a contrast between the more fruity profile and still somewhat-dry body. The flavor is still not quite as harmonious as Id like, not sure if the 003 flavor will ever get to Deviation-level integration, but this is still mind-bogglingly drinkable and balanced. At 2.5 years, this is drinking better than any US sour Ive had at that age. Vinnie wins again. 10510419
batch 003 on 9/28/10, 32-33 months oldDefinitely on the way down. Too much Brett, not enough Chardonnay left. A bit mineral as well, still great with a beautiful body and appearence, just starting to fall apart. 958518","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
1131,"2009-04-27",4.4,"I think I was expecting this to be more sour than it actually was but the wine barrel must have sweetened it up.

Aroma of soft vinegar sour, ripe apples, oak and farmyard funk. Nice integrated, gentle nose. Taste is sharp acidity initially, followed by the fruit from the nose (apples) plus wine grape notes. The oak barrel takes over midway through, with lemon citrus sour kicking up at the finish. Wow, the sour tartness at the start really evolved at the finish. The sour is never overpowering, just a nice amount of prickliness to the beer. The Brett notes are there, but pretty subdued.

Brilliant, clear, bright yellow gold with a fine, medium-thick white head.  Lovely, fresh, tart aroma with yellow fruit and strawberry over a soft spiciness and wood-aged oxidation.  The brett character shoes itself nicely in the flavor with focused, well-balanced sourness and darker ""animal"" characteristics against the light, yet sturdy, golden malt profile.  Some alcohol comes through faintly in the long, multi-dimensional finish.  This is finely-crafted, delicate, somewhat understated sour ale that slowly reveals itselfs quite rewardingly.  Excellent.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
1131,"2009-02-20",4.1,"375ml bottle courtesy of largadeer, thanks a bunch for the opportunity. Beautiful, golden blonde color, cloudy. The smell is excellent and suggests sour and wine. The taste is pretty darn good and less sour than expected but still a pucker. This seems a little more subtle and complex compared to Supplication and Beatification but then maybe they arent meant to be compared? There is not much funk to be found but all in all this is excellent. Ive been skeptical about paying high prices for beer but these barrel-aged RR beers are worth it in my mind.

Aromas are sheer heaven, noticable as soon as the bottle is popped: touches of barnyard funk and sourness mixed with white wine and grapes, tangerine and peaches, light sweet tarty fruitness with grapefruit and citrus, dry oak, and a touch of floral and tropical fruit thrown in. Complex, yet discernible. Initial is brings a light pucker to the lips, a nice sourness mixed with a dry oakiness, fruity body and funkiness from the brett. Delicate, but full of flavor. Funk and brett shine through on the backend moreso, with sour and fruit melange in the initial and body. Finishes clean, with a lingering sourness and dryness. This is simply heaven. White winey characteristics of the barrel help compliment the brew, leaving it extremely well balanced and sessionable. My favorite type of wild ale. Cheers and a big thanks to Beerlando!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

1131,"2009-01-22",4.2,"been looking forward to this one for a while.  Batch 003, been sitting in my cellar (thanks to lb4LB! - thanks dude!) for about 2 months.  12.7 oz bottle  -- I must say Russian River has the coolest bottles ever, pretty sweet labels too.  Lively pop of the cork, which was moist on the bottom.  Pours a great golden color with a bit of a tangerine hue and a nice big fluffy head that hangs around for a while.   Aroma is soft and beautiful with notes of chardone, tart white grape skins, oaky vanilla, and the sour and slightly funky brett that I have come to love so much.  Complex and refreshing aroma.  The flavor is equally as impressive.  It starts off pretty dry and fruity -- white wine rapes -- which morphs beautifully into a tangy dry tartness that is followed through with a long funky (but not overpoweringly so) finish, whcih includes some great horseblanket and barnyard character to it.  It is a bit to carbonated for my general taste, but the carbonation seems to go with the wine/champagne-like style.  Medium to light bodied.  no trace of alcohol anywhere.  Overall: great style, great example of it, very refreshing, very drinkable, beautifully done.  My first RR! w00t!

P.s.  this stuff with only a few months on it would be a great brew to get some noobs into the sour style.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

1131,"2008-10-28",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2010 375mL bottle. 10/28/08. Beautiful looking beer; creamy white head like a babys ass. Aroma is incredibly strong-mainly just very sour smelling, lemony, with detectable oak, some earthy funk. The flavor is where it gets really interesting. Its two-toned, in that there is the main tart, sour, fruitiness that I expected. And then, upon the middle of my tongue, there falls a tantalizing, yet dull/flat/smooth maltiness, similar to a BSA in a way. Then in the finish this malt character is very drying, bitter, oaky, apple, and actually pungent and dirt-like, and I mean that in the best possible way. Meanwhile the sour lemon teases the sides and front of the tongue. 8/5/9/4/16

375mL bottle from Whole Foods-Westwood on 10/6/10. Lots of Chardonnay coming through. Very white wine like through and through. Moderately bretty. Not really much for sourness. Still good, but I miss the sour. Some funk in the aroma. 8/4/8/4/15-3.9","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"

The taste is predominantly of sour fruits but it is not so overpowering as to cover up the nice oakiness and light malt sweetness. This is best described as subtle but amazing. At first I had the taste as a 9 but it just got even better as it warmed and had to change it to a 10. The mouthfeel is great for a sour,very dry and wine like.

Oak is noticable but not with vanilla or smoke, but the texture is valvet for a sour.  Sour gives lift and cleans the palate for a seemless and long finish.  Could see how this can miss out on the WOW factor as its subtle and deserves to be aged a couple years.  No real sweetness to note.  Some yeast has settled but not much.

1131,"2008-07-16",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2008 Appropriate pour, excellent aged Sauternes color.  A swirled galaxy of gossamer foam roams around the surface as the Bordeaux glass does its work.  Candied pineapple is quickly nudged aside by wet leather and earth spice with a slight vanilla kiss.  Farmyard and sour peaches are boltstered by the acidity and mellowed through light carbonation.  Chardonnay is certainly apparant (apples) upfront and particularly on the finish. The vinous quality of the grapes and the tartness of the beer make a gracious exit. This bottle must be at least 2 years old.  Age has soothed the once vibrant acid and the yeast have lent a balance of cream and mouthfeel.  Excellent beer, well balanced and spell-binding.

Smell is a good dose of sweet, sour and tart.  There is the sweet citrus of lemon rinds and oranges along with some tart cherry and a bit of oak as well.  This is all on top of the bready yeast smell in the background and some wine coming through in the nose as well.

The taste is a slightly more tart version of the smell with big tart cherries and lemon rind up front with a trace of barnyard funk as well.  There’s a little sweetness in there as well with a bready malt backbone but an oaky presence that lingers in the finish.

Pours a hazy straw-yellow with a nice and incredibly persistent white head. Beautiful. Nice sour lactic nose, some oak barrel. The flavor is really smooth and really nice. Plenty of delicious bret, some of chardonnay-oak, slightly buttery, tart but not aggressively so, pleasingly dry, beautifully balanced, more wood than funk. This comes together like a gem and makes for a very easy-going but uncompromising dry sour. Its really easy drinking, compared to some of the more challenging RR offerings (a back to back Supplication is much more sour, for example) but it is missing noting. Brilliant. 8/5/8/4/16

1131,"2008-06-05",4.1,"Mini-vertical sampling of batch 2 vs. 3.

Both batches open up with a loud pop, and straw in color. Batch 2 gushed up within seconds, allowing some hazy yeast to make it into the glass. Batch 3 was clear. Lacing and retention is superior in batch 2, but in either case, not exceptional.

Batch 2:
Plenty of dry, bretty character, with wine-like mustyness, and a smidge of oak in the nose. Earthy, hay-like, and lightly tropical with pineapple. A hint of quanine and minerally bite.

Thin to medium mouthfeel. A decent amount of effervesence and slightly creamy with an edge.

Tart and vineous on the pallet. Grassy, hay-like, and slightly peppery. Plenty of lemony pizzaz and acid. Loads of finesse, barn-like earthiness, and white grape must.

Finishes with lingering lemon pith, white pepper, and warming acidity.

Batch 3:
A trace of sweet malt leads off in tandem with tart wheat. The Brett is restrained, but present, which allows traces of orange citrus fruits, vanilla, smoldered styrofoam, and ground bark to step forward. Quite earthy and unique. 

Crisp and creamy mouthfeel. Tart and quenching.

Tart lemon pulp leads off the pallet, with sour grapes, grapefruit pith, and pineapple skin. A trace of pepper with plenty of clove.

Finishes exceedingly vineous with tart lemons, wet hay, and pepper-studded grapefruit.

The low-down:

Batch 2 certainly has developed more brett, pepper, pineapple, and funk in general. Dryer and more complex than 3, which is really saying something. 2 is also more vineous, tart and acidic than 3. A couple of things I enjoyed in the 3 over the 2 was the vanilla in the nose, and the slight tropical orange note. The 2 is definately headed in a more Gueze-like direction, but certainly nowhere near the acid level of a good Gueze.

While I prefer the 2 over the 3, it is by a marginal amount and is just a testament to how well Vinnies barrel aged beers cellar.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

Big foamy white head.  Smells of gueuze-y brett surrounding a blossom of big round lemony orange.  The acid is pretty subdued in the mouth, but it lasts for a long time.  Vanilla oak and lime rind are the main notes I can pick out of the flavor.  Great beer, elegant and subtle.  8/5/8/4/16 = 4.1

Original Rating. GABF 2004; rating from the festival, enterred from old notes.  Smells are intense and wonderful, very sour and elegant.  Pours with a large head, even in small tasting glass; looks wonderful.  Taste is tart with some ""swill notes"" (I dont remember what I meant by that, but judging from the rest of the notes, I think there was some funkiness that didnt agree with me).  After getting used to the acidity, body seems a bit watery.  I had originally written a 17 for the overall, but I dropped it down to 16 and then 15, probably because I wasnt liking the funkiness of the yeast.

1131,"2008-05-14",4.4,"Batch 003.  Pours a brilliantly bright yellow/golden color with a medium sized white head that has great retention and solid lacing, just like Supplication.  Steady stream of bubbles zip to the top.  While I didnt detect any Pinot Noir in the Supplication, Chardonnay immediately jumps out of this one.  Also noted are some mild esters, banana, slight pepper and all around fruitiness.  Brettanomyces present but kept in check, mostly providing a pepper earthiness.  White grapes, some lemon, and perhaps a touch of alcohol are also noted.  The combination of Brett and Chardonnay is a very nice pairing, they mix well together.  The warmer the beer gets the more the aroma becomes more intensely fruity and citrusy, perhaps pineapple.  Taste is lemony, acidic and tart.  The level of sourness is pretty much perfect, it is light but keeps with the beers subtle nature.  This is just super drinkable.

1131,"2008-02-05",4.3,"Batch 002.  This one has been sitting in the fridge for months, and I couldnt wait any longer to crack it open.  The cork popped with a good amount of force, giving way to a slow gush that I was thankfully prepared for.  The pour yields a cloudy, glowing, light yellow-orange body.  A small, foamy white head settles to a thin blanket, leaving broad archways of lacing bands stretched out upon the glass.  The aroma is beautiful, showing a complex blend of everything from sour Brett funk to Chardonnay grapes, vanilla, oak, lemons, and light caramel.  The scent is quite ascorbic, with citrus and sharp grape mingling perfectly with the sour Brett.  As sour as the nose is, it doesnt quite prepare you for the lambic-like intensity of the flavor.  Brett hits immediately, lashing the tongue and the roof of the mouth with its signature bitter funk.  The Chardonnay kissed oak is easily identified, accompanied by the requisite vanilla component and sharp, sour, lemon and orange citric extracts.  The mouthfeel is substantial and almost perfect for the style, with a drying effect that seems to concentrate the sour fruit components on the tongue.  This is a masterfully crafted brew.  Ultimately refreshing, substantially sour, and completely delicious.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I will say that I think Ross told me this was Batch 002 and that would put it about 2 years old when we opened it.

I have been sitting on this for a while now waiting for the right occasion to crack it open.  The Christmas holidays seemed as good as any.  If the bretty aspects got to me at least I would have plenty of time to recover.  It turns out that this did not have the same punch as other sour beers.  Instead the sourness was more subtle and calm.  I wish I had another bottle as two glasses was not quite enough.
Aroma / Appearance - The rose colored body was moderately carbonated with a thin head that lasts for a second.  The nose was dirty gym socks, lemon pine sol and that general funkiness that comes from bretty beers.  Almonds and honey glazing complete the sherrylike nose.
Flavor / Palate - Sherry and almonds infuse the mouth with a sweet almost sugary taste.  White wine mixed with apple, pear and almonds comes next.  The finish is dry and yeasty.  It was so easy to drink that before too long my glass and bottle were both empty.  This must be one of the tamer Russian River releases or two years has calmed it down.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1131,"2007-12-13",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2007 Batch 2, Sampled December 2007
It was definitely a slight mistake to serve this at near cellar temperatures (60ºF / 15.5ºC), as the beer foamed up and started gushing as soon as I popped the cork.  I only lost a couple ounces though.  The beer forms a frothy, scant fat-one-finger thick, pale, off white colored head that is actually quite persistent.  The beer is a hazy, slightly chunky, orange tinted, dark straw color.  The oak character seems much subdued from the first batch (which is a good thing as this was my main complaint with that beer).  This is nice and funky, notes of urea, aromatic goat, farmhouse-stinky-cheese, a definite cattiness, mushroom spore and a host of sharp phenolics that at times approaches fresh curing plastic.  Underneath the funk is a nice fruit character reminiscent of tart, un-ripened white grapes (sauvignon blanc & gewürztraminer come to mind), as well as touch of green apple and tart pear aromas.  The aroma on this is really quite nice, it is definitely ringing my funky bone right now.

Tart, but not aggressively so (at least for this Gueuze addict), it is somehow soft and creamy feeling, despite the still present carbonation.  This creaminess has definitely been picked up in the barrel as oak notes add some tongue coating softness to this brew and even some heft to the body; suggestive from the butter-like oak flavors this makes the beer actually feel buttery in texture.  Soft oak contributions of vanillin, a definite sharp spiciness and perhaps a hint of buttery-oak notes are all found here, though the spicy notes are definitely the largest oak character here.  The wine analogy continues as the process used is definitely a contributor; definitely reminiscent of an oaky chardonnay as this beer has flavors of green fruit, star-fruit, flint, a certain light metallic quality and that definite oak presence.  The funky wee-beasts and the oak contribute spice notes of white pepper, piquant ginger, The flavor is not quite as funky as the aroma might have suggested, but I think this is ultimately a good thing as it allows the complexity of the fruit, oak and spiciness to come through.  The sourness, while present and definitive, is so well integrated that it is not overly noticed on its own.

The oak character is much more in check with this the second batch.  This is a far superior beer in my opinion (and it hasnt taken anywhere near 5 years as I last predicted) as the oak, while present, now plays a supporting role.  If successive batches keep getting better, then I am going to need to re-baseline my scoring.  Just a fantastic brew.  The texture is phenomenal & the flavor is just so well integrated and nuanced.  The aroma, while absolutely engaging and complex, may actually be a bit too funky.  Let me explain that though, because I absolutely love funk and the funk found in the aroma, while dominant, is so well integrated together, but it is a bit too dominant to let the nuanced oak, grape and malt notes through (despite being so inviting and characterful).  I may even need to crack a batch 1 just to see what is happening to that  .I still maintain that these 375ml bottles just arent quite enough, as I always want more of this brew after draining my glass.  Though if it was a 750s worth, my proliferous text might be pushing the extremes of my already superfluous ramblings.
Batch 1, Sampled July 2005
7/4/7/4/16 total 3.8
Pours a lightly hazy orange-copper color, it is pretty well carbonated and has a frothy pale, almost white head.  The aroma is quite oaky with lots of buttery notes, an astringent woodiness, notes of grapes (perhaps sauvignon or chardonnay), notes of pears, and some subtle spice notes.  Quite an interesting nose on this one.

The beer is quite light on the palate, and very dry.  The dryness actually suppresses the oakiness a bit, but it is definitely still here.  The finish is quite long with a subtle tannic woodiness to it.  There is a light acidity (for a Lambic at least) here as well, more similar to the lactic character of a Lambic than the acetic character of a Flemish sour beer.  I am really quite relieved that I dont get any diacetyl in this beer (I am quite sensitive to it), there is a bit of buttery character (mostly in the aroma), but this is definitely oak derived.  There is a certain spritzy character to this beer that is a combination of the carbonation and the acidity.

This beer is really quite interesting, Vinnie still has a ways to go, but this has more to do with the barrels than Vinnie at this point.  I think that Vinnie has the touch, in perhaps 5 years (if the wee bugs are compliant and amenable) the new releases of this should be stellar.

1131,"2007-11-05",4.3,"375 ml bottle.  Batch 002.  Rating #3000.  Very pale straw/golden colour topped by a huge white head. Aroma is quite funky with lots of soft wood, leather and a very vineous flemish sour sort of aroma.  A touch of earthy/woody character.  Lightly acetic with a soft vanilla and oaky flavour.  Complex and quite intoxicating.  There is a great pear/apple/melon fruitiness underlying the dominant funk and oak.  Velvety soft texture with lots of funk and tartness, but the acidity is quite soft.  Quite different from other Russian River sour beers (with the possible exception of Depuration).  Soft vanilla and oak.   Great balance.  Man, I wish these guys were still shipping outside of California. A great beer for #3000.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

The color is a hazy orange-gold with a lively white head (gushed just a bit).  Aroma has a pleasant funky sourness that can only come from my pal Brett.  Some wood, wine, and citrus detectable as well.  Flavor is a pleasant woody, citrus, sour blend that is really tasty.  Citrus is more dominant than with Supplication, but I really like it and want more.  Mouthfeel is nice with a pleasant finish - the use of wine barrels is wonderful here.

1131,"2007-09-27",4.3,"Pours a very frothy snow white soapy head.  Stays for a bit, but does start to fall eventually leaving some lace on the glass. Pretty straw color, but since its non-filtered, and bottle conditioned, it has a bit of a cloudy nature to it. Aroma is interesting. Actually reminds me of a gewurtzraminer wine as it is going into the primary fermenter up in Napa Valley. Since its oak aged that seems natural to me. Nice level of carbonation. Sourness in flavor. Clean palate and aftertaste, reminiscent of drinking a cold white wine. Would definitely buy again, and regularly, if it werent so blasted expensive. Will have to make it up to the brewery to try it sometime as this bottle has been ""aging"" in my fridge for a year, or so, so the Bret has been tamed a bit.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

1131,"2007-07-06",4.8,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2008 Bottle courtesy Odeed. Pour was golden with haziness, lots of head from the bottle even after pouring a few ml’s for a rinse, just oozing from the bottle top, quick rinse and pour. The lacing was stellar, head retention great. The aroma was very nice, tart lemons and cherries (or some other fruity character, not a pure sour lemon drop), bret, yeast, some spicing. The flavor was excellent, tart/sour lemons, other tart fruits, approaching a flemish sour of the quality of Panil and La Folie, yet with much more of a malt support than either, sweetish fruits, bread, and yeast underneath, yet far from sweet, of course oak and other wood notes making a firm appearance, touches of mint too. The funk is gentle, somewhat leathery, and this thing just blows away Jolly Pumpkin’s sour/bret action. If this is what RR is all about, gimme more!!!! An outstanding beer, one of my fav’s perhaps of all my ratings? Thanks again, Jacob!

1131,"2007-06-30",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2007 Batch 1, fresh and aged 18 months and batch 2, also fresh. Body is slightly hazy, vibrant light golden with soft tangerine hues. Thick lacing results from a sticky, tall head of fizzy but compacted bubbles that recedes rather quickly. The aroma is very tart, earthy and speaks volumes about its inspirational precedents. Funk, barnyard, oak, citrus fruits, grapes, noble hops, buttery and acidic white wine, brettanomyces and a yeast profile so vibrant it seems like the entire lab is in the glass. Alcohol is totally hidden. The flavor is much the same, with approachable but distinct characteristics, focused but reserved. Sourness is mild, tartness is mild to moderate. Lightly sweet and mildly acidic, the taste is soft and utterly brilliant. Flavors run the gamut from tart and fruity at first to oaky and vinous nearing the finale, all the while showcasing a dynamic brett component that makes each sip lively and refreshing. Lemony acidity and flavor is an exciting addition. This is an exacting, coalescent moment of funk that doesnt overwhelm. Delicious. The finish is soft, luxurious and as long as I feel like enjoying it. Id ultimately have to take a sip of something else to pass beyond the everlasting finish. The mouthfeel is adequately and softly carbonated, with intermittent fizzy bursts. Body is light-medium and semi-sweet. Another superb offering from Russian River.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

A slight hint of mellowed grape or even cherry in the first sip, but then its a lovely dry tartness, with a slight hint of bitter like you get from orange peels (funny given that RR is ensconced in the land of rich, buttery Chards too).

Wet leather and farmhouse aromas, peat and cayenne pepper, pungent vinegar.  Fades softly into a kind of pistachio-crème white cake sweetness.  The sourness here is soft and balanced, while the Chardonnay barrel lends a rich almond-butter depth.  Wild notes of sea mist and wet oak rafts.  An acidic pulse of lemon seed blossoms with a confident, imposing strength upon swallowing.  Ringing with crystal clarity, sour but bright, complicated but melodic.  One to savor and treasure.

 July 2008.   Batch 003, thanks to Steve.  Sunshine blonde pour and a wispy cream of meringue.  Almond cake batter, leathery brett and lemon juice, hay must and attic dried spice in the aroma.  The sunshine of the orchard and the evocative calm of the farmhouse dusts.  Acetic acids and a range of tangy spice effects a jagged edge, while the  Chardonnay barrel maintains its cool and reservation, lending polish.  Far out horseblanket salt, sweat and grimy earth.  The restraint of the sourness, the pristine shimmer of pale malts in the glow of chardonnay oak, and the bittering calm of floral earthiness sleep gracefully together in the flavor.  The essence of morning in the meadows.  The angular impartation of wild yeasts is somewhat submerged, and integrates itself with ease into oak and white grape tannins.  This makes for a truly spectacular drinkability; while marked with the distinctive sour flair of bret and pedio, the lactic yeasts seem more prominent in lending a silky, soft tartness; wholly perfect to accentuate that Chardonnay presence that already works so well.  Yeast dropped lends a pit of stone fruit quality throughout alongside a sharpened and more detailed sourness.  The gravelly character of the white wine is pronounced, again just exaggerating how perfect the blend of these yeasts with this barrel actually is.  Sparkly palate is medium in body and maintains a gorgeous balance of velvet texture and diamond-sharp acidity.  Pineapple and a distant doughiness alongside the drying leather of animal yeasts in a long but understated finish.  AGAIN, its the amazing balance of the elements here thats truly breathtaking; its one of those moments when art grabs hold of you and simply demands to be revered. 10/5/10/5/20 5.0","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1131,"2006-12-19",4.2,"375mL bottle, batch 001, courtesy of gears81.  Thanks, Jake!!  Hazy and cloudy grapefruit appearance; brilliant white head with nice retention and lacing at the edges.  Ive had this once before, when it first came out, and this definitely has significantly more brett character that I remember.  Full, complex aroma: a strong helping of brett coupled with an oaky chardonnay underneath: buttery, toasty, with warm vanilla notes.  Plenty of tartness upfront in the mouthfeel; mild acidity.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel, showing citrus, somewhat reserved (surprisingly) chardonnay qualities - butter, toasty oak - and a chewy, belgian sugar backdrop.  Nicely layered, though the aroma suggests a warmer mouthfeel than one actually receives.  The oaky chardonnay quality returns at the finish: plenty of butter and vanilla in a lengthy departure.  Ive got a few bottles of Batch 002 that I havent yet picked up from a friends house, and Im curious to see how the increased brett character changes things.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Ill wait until this warms up to continue.  The oak does become more apparent with a fair amount of yeast.  Flavor is much the same with some very nice fruity sweetness and a pleasant vinous quality as well.  It is fairly acidic, but the sweetness dont make this overbearing at all.  I feel this would be a transition beer to bret and oak (though not bourbon) aged beers.  The finish is dry which is somewhat winelike and earthy.

Appears a hazy, pale gold with a fluffy white cap that slowly fades out. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of citrusy, funk, oak, vanilla, brett, and mild sugar.
Taste is of the same aromas in a wonderfully done brew. The flavors jump along the palate with glee. Highlights include the light funk mixed with wine, vanilla, and some sugary caramel. This is hardcore and it outdoes some of the counterparts overseas.
Mouthfeel is of a spritzy, nicely carbonated yet restrained brew that is smooth but bouncey with the CO2 giving rise to the vanilla esters riding along the sugary, chardonnay grapes.
Vinnie is an excellent brewer. He is at the top of the charts for American brewers IMHO. With the wine background, he has the experience to make this stuff work. This is no exception to the rule. Well done.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Which makes it that much more amazing that it is in fact a beer.  The aroma was all sorts of funk, yeast, oak, fruits, lemon zests, and the best chardonnay wine aromas.  The taste absolutely followed suit.  The commercial description says it all with ""is it beer or is it wine?""  Either way this stuff is awesome!!!!

Sour like socks from a winery that have been stomping grapes, only mixed with barley.  Intensely fruity, white wine nose.  As a drink - splendid.  Quite unlike beer, slightly sour, but refreshing - wine like but not like wine - fresh, cool, refreshing.  apples, pears.  The sourness of brett is at a modestly low-ish point on the dial; this should be palatable for all but the stubbornest of drinkers.

One word: pears. My lasting impression was almost entirely pears, maybe a little peach if I want to allow for some room there. But not obnoxious or overly fruity. I agree with the producers own description - the semblence in nose and even taste is all white wine, and specifically, chardonnay. And you know what? Its freakin awesome. Im not a big wine guy, but the complexity and depth of flavor stages in this beer is really something one must try to truly appreciate. Ive had other beers aged in chard casks (Petrus), but this is different. This is special.

1131,"2006-05-05",4.8,"Rating #500.  375 ml bottle, Batch 1, served in a Duvel glass.  After I poured this, the only thing I could say when I looked at it was ""here lies a beautiful  beer"".  Pours a bright, virtually clear, deep golden yellow body under a nice fluffy white head.  The head settled to a thin and creamy mass after a few minutes and retained for the duration due to fairly active visible carbonation.  I could have just looked at and smelled this for a half hour and been happy.  First a slightly sugary sweet yet lightly sour aroma rises up to meet you, followed by some citrus fruitiness and oak with noticable chardonnay characteristics.  Lastly that oh so beautiful bretty yeasty bouquet.  I want to use that buzzword ""funky""  to describe it, yet its really much more refined than your average saison funkiness.  Flavor is soft and delicate with just the most gentle acidic tartness up front with oak tannins, pepper, apricot, and just a hint of Grannie Smith apples.  The amazingly subdued brett flavor is a testament to this brewers skill and knowledge to not let these little critters take over and muddle the flavor.  This is just as clean of a flavor as you can get with these yeasties.  The mouthfeel is just as perfect as can be with very fine carbonation that gives a lively feel without becoming foamy.  Nicely drying on the finish.  Overall, this is as close to a perfect beer for me as I have rated yet, and one of the best examples of a barrel aged beer available.

Forefront not terribly exciting, with the acidic notes blending with a light watery alcohol. Finish is the real winner. A lingering of part fruity sweet cream malts, gentle white fins, pears and some pork fats. Real smooth and slick. Finishes out with  dash of drying hops and herbs.

When it finally settled in my glass, it was a transaparant apple juice color with a thick, tightly bubbled, borderline creamy looking, white head.  Green apple rinds, pineapple, and lemon blend together in an acidic, farmhouse funky bouquet.  A sublty sweet pear and apple toffee aroma also wafts from beneath.

1131,"2006-01-18",4.0,"Many more thanks to kramer17801 for this beer.  It poured a nice golden glassy color with a small and sustaining white foam top.  Aroma comes off first with a wine tinted oak and some sourness is there as well.  The palate comes off as crisp first off, very subtle at it, but very enjoyable.  The bitterness expected in the palate did not come through as expected from the aroma.  Likewise, there was only a slight sour funk left in the flavor.  There is a slight flavor of lemon and spice in the beer, but its very subtle.  This is not as an extreme of a flavor as Supplication, but is so well balanced and sublte, yet complex, it is hard not to like it.  Im no wine fanatic, but I suspect this would be a great bridge between the two crafts.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

Taste is totally incredible with huge amount of farmhouse (there is probably a better word for this but it is the only I can think of right now), sour notes resembling a lambic and Brett, which is reminiscent of Orval. The Chardonnay barrel effect is maybe a bit too accentuated but still very interesting. Also, it might be a bit too acidic for my liking but it is still very much enjoyable.

Potent aromatics, screaming sour from afar....on closer inspection, yup, thats tart, with citrus and spice squeaking in...deep, heady stuff....beautiful.

Sourness is the main game in the mouth, blasting the tongue, then fading gently. Bracingly tart. Then smooth, but never releasing the hold of the tart, accompanied by some fruit and a bit of spice. Nice. 

Full-bodied and fresh. Zesty, snappy, tangy...quite an accomplishment, matching the quality of Belgian ales so well that if you didnt know, youd swear this bottle crossed an ocean.

Fair amount of dry woodyness, malt, touch of honey. Light palate with fairly evident carbonation. Finish is rather dry, clean, with a subtle but tangible bitterness. A very nice and interesting beer.

Perfect aromatic display of pinot grigio, green grape skin and moderate lemon husk scraps.  Complexities, follow me.  Additional wafts and flavor spawned dimensions hint at stamped chardonnay grapes and souring compounds reminiscent of pears to some degree.  In check sourness prevails with brett and dirty yeast.  Soured from the confines of the wine barrel.  Trace elements of oaken smoothness.  Green grapes and select persuasions of chardonnay and pinot gregio are definitely enjoying their hay day.

1131,"2005-11-20",4.2,"Picked up by BA RedwoodGeorge for the trade with me, this beer came in an oddly sized (375 ml) corked brown bottle, with a wire cage to finish the package.  The cork came out resoundingly, and the beer started forming head in the bottle before pouring!  The vigorous carbonation action continued unabated in the oversized wine glass, and the head that formed kept building up over the first few minutes rather than dissipating, and at the end of this spectacle, the head crowned an inch above the rim of the glass in the shape of a volcano.

The body underlying Mount Temptation was pale, cloudy, and very bubbly.  The aroma was soured unripe cherries and fresh cut hay.  There was also a little more alcohol in the nose than I was expecting.  The taste was oh so dry and tart.  Not quite as mouth-puckeringly acidic as a gueze lambic, this beer still had a similar taste of a lemon-lime juice mixed with wheat ale. There was also a peppery zing followed by a tannic woody flavor, and a hint of sweetness.  Unlike a true lambic, there was no horse blanket funk here.

The finish was smooth and vanilla-creamy, and the aforementioned sweetness a little more noticeable in the aftertaste.  This beer exhibited a very complex flavor profile, and yet remained quite drinkable and refreshing.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Original: 10 minutes earlier...This is unbelievable. Dry, smooth and catchy in the throat all at the same time. Mmm oh boy. Tinderbox dry. Balsawood chewing for half an hour dry. This is dry. Parching dryness. OK. The aroma is multiple strains of weirdness all at the same time wet rotting mushroom and wet wood and pale fruit like peach. And it just plays with your nose right there. The flavor is...well, there are some sweet parts, more like peach and canteloupe I guess. And some white wine maybe, not so sure except that its contributing to the entire experience. I think actually some of the flavor is like grape skins. Dry like that. Even the way the palate changes over the entire beer is amazing from too cold and thin to expansive. It looks luminescent. It begins to stink nicely by the midpoint of the beer. Wow.  --- Not so much of a pop upon opening and a wet cork. The cork leaves tiny bits signal of a labor of love.

Funky barnyard and horse blanket aromas are strong but never sharp.  Oak and tart white grapes shine through.  Fresh hay and the slightest hint of toffee malt.  Lemon zest and orange sherbet further along.  Honey sweetness of a Gala apple and the subtle spiciness of black pepper.  Earthy and rustic yeast profile.  Challah bread and a handful of crushed flowers.  My nose is continually lured back to the glass.  Surprisingly complex sweetness at first sip.  A veritable orchard of light fruits.  Healthy carbonation keeps the somewhat thick body from being sticky up front.  A gentle roll around the tongue reveals brisk black pepper and soft honey.  The finish shows off the Chardonnay lineage with rich and zesty citrus as well as a soothing buttery smoothness.  The lingering, tingling dryness is a testament to the miracles of Brettanomyces.  The firm body, velvet texture and spritzy carbonation play well together throughout this breathtaking experience.  This is one of those beers I can never just sit back and drink.  Every moment is a new experience, every smell unique, every taste a treasure.  The yeasty last pour smoothes the sharpness a bit and adds to the already pleasant tartness.

The aroma is characteristically Brettanomyces.  Lemons, sour funkiness, sour green apples, pears.  The flavor starts off tart with green apples.  Cinnamon sticks and apple skin fill out the mid-taste.  Oaken earthy wine on the finish.  The flavors are quite complex and very good.  The palate is like drinking a champagne or spritzer.  Very lively and refreshing.  Light dryness to it like a dry wine.  Im glad to have tried this.  I just wish the $$ wasnt so much.  Its sorta geueze-ish and winey.  Im liking it. 8, 3, 9, 4, 17 = 4.1

1131,"2005-07-31",4.7,"375ml Batch 1 bottle: Bottle conditioned.  Served in a large tulip glass from IKEA (great beer glasses).  Mostly clear, but ever so slightly cloudy rich amber body with a medium white head that simply lasts until Ive finished all the beer in my glass.  I can honestly say Ive never tried a beer that smells or tastes quite like this one.  The aroma is strawberries, sour cherries, and sweet oak barrel if inhaled forcefully with the nose as far in the glass as possible.  If the glass is tilted until the beer almost touches the nose then scents of chardonnay, acidic barnyard, and sour grapes come out.  If the nose is barely held over the edge of the glass then aromas exactly resembling yellow cake with butter icing, honeysuckle immediately following a rain and a very subtle hint of cocoa beans come through.  Ok, I spent a bit of time with this one.  Now onto the flavors.  Initially this beer doesnt really blow me away.  I get flavors of lightly acidic wine, grapes, cherries, cider, and vanilla.  Then, as its held in the mouth, light flavors of barnyard, white grape juice, crabapple, and oak show themselves.  What really blew me away from the first sip was the aftertaste.  Almost immediately after swallowing a strong oak comes through - but its not overly harsh or acidic - rather it reminds me very much of the fleeting qualities of a good port, the almost sweet pure wood notes.  From there it then turns to a bit of chardonnay, and then surprisingly a sweet nutty/caramel/almond flavor that perfectly counterbalances the oak notes.  Medium bodied, medium-lively carbonation, can get slightly watery towards the end ( my fault for taking my time enjoying this one).  The aftertaste is like no other, and much, much longer than Ive previously experienced with other beers.  I am not normally very taken with the barrel-aging fad, but this one absolutely works.  Vinnie, if you read these, a superb job innovating with this one.  Hopefully well see more of these from Russian River.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

Served in a lambic flute (why the hell not!) starting at about 48 degrees and progressively warmer from there.How about a top 10 reasons why I love this beer so much?1.  American but not Americanized2.  A beautiful and tempting sourness can be sensed from the nose.3.  Warm, light fruity tones, and very soft, approachable barrel character, with a delicate yet vibrant yeastiness.  Not to mention a wonderful, permeating strength to the aroma.4.  No foaming when opened, unfiltered, unpasteurized, moderate head, with perfect retention and tons of lacing.  Brilliant, tiny bubbles.5.  Another one of those beers you dont want to stop sniffing.  Funky and charming, it takes a mountain to remove the glass from your nose.6.  Such a deliciously seductive acidity.7.  Though I dont even care much for Chardonnay, and am generally skeptical of barrel-aging, this is superbly done and most importantly, nowhere near overdone.8.  Perfect mouthfeel, to my taste, with delicate, tiny bubbles, tingly and bursting all over the palate to provide wood, apricots, peaches, nectarines, white pepper and light apples.9.  The brettanomyces are noticeable but do not dominate the beer, an awesome accomplishment for American brewing.10.  A 375mL bottle goes down WAY too fast.  At my last sip, it seems like I just took my first.Great stuff, Vinnie!

The palate is delicate, flowery and vibrantly tart in a pineapple way. Fresh fruitiness brings the complexity through the roof.

I was amazed at the creativity that went into crafting this beer.  This has a pleasant aroma that almost resembles champagne.  The aging process in the Chardonnay barrels definitely accounts for this, as well as its unique flavor.  This came off heavily carbonated and a little sweet, but totally different than any beer Ive ever had.  One of the truly amazing things about this beer (also true with Supplication), is that just like wine, it has legs!  Go ahead and swirl in your glass and see for yourself! Outstanding!

Great now but Im guessing this will be outstanding with a little age on it.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"
1131,"2005-06-28",4.3,"Batch 001: Gold with some haze. Generous rocky blanket of white foam yields patchy lace. Lavish mesh of baked pears, putty, vanillin oak, buttered malt husks, and toasted hay in the aroma. Seductive whispers of brett. Impeccably conditioned. Creamy but fluffily full, along with enough chalky dryness to match. Early brett-laced surge of vanilla-tinged white grapes and vibrant melon. Immense malt spine quickly blossoms, casting a rich medley of crushed husks and newly harvested hay on the palate. Buttery oak and husky 2-row absorb the brief white grape skin acidity that ensues, but plenty of acidity remains. Brilliantly stated oakiness yields more dryness, which amplifies the firm texture of minerals and tongue-numbing brett. Simultaneously tart and sweet with a candied lemon zest twist. Brett deposits complementary notes of gritty minerals which are elegantly softened by ripe melon notes. Finishes less acidic, but intricately flavored with a continuation of white pepper dusted melon and sour apples amid prolonged echoes of grainy oak and husky malts. This is something to be proud of to say the least. Truly a spellbinding creation.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1131,"2005-06-25",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2005 Orange pale, pleinement brouillée et opaque, peu de dégagement gazeux lors du service à partir du fut.  Ananas et fruits exotique, lotion après rasage, un brin de cuir jeune, caractéristiques pleinement sauvages,   signature mielleuse et presque vineuse fidèle et de connivence à la bonté dun vieux chardonnay en début de madérisation.  Pleinement reminiscente dune gueuze authentique pour plusieurs de ces aspects, sauvage, couverture de cheval, grange.  Acide et pleinement tartrique, finale très sèche faisant grincher les dents.  Corps pleinement atténué, se rapprochant de la densité de leau sans ne sembler aqueux pour autant.  Douce carbonatation offrant le parfait support à ce nectar divin.

1131,"2005-06-19",3.8,"Aroma is cidery, with spices, and an earthy background.  Tastes of Apples, Nutmeg, Chardoney, hints of oak.  The oak compliments for forward tastes very well.  Reminds me somewhat of Deus, but much cheaper.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
1131,"2005-06-04",4.2,"Opaque golden - it has that nectar look to it.  Say what you want about Vinnies beers - they are beautiful to look at.  The aroma is bretty, corky, and highly vinous - the most directly winey nose since Stille Nacht Reserva.  The flavour is slightly toasty, highly vinous with a puckeringly tart finish.  There is a bit of astringency at the back.  Leathery, fairly tart finish.  Firm pale malts and alcohol support the effort throughout.  Kick ass.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy dark yellow, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain), moderately yeasty (barnyard, cobwebs, horseblanket), with notes of sour apple, lemon/lime/orange peel, wet stones, SweetTarts candy, gooseberries, cask wood, band-aid (only the finest), etc.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly astringent.

So elegant, so beautiful, so complex!  Batch 2 is just as good as Batch 1, if a touch more rustic/horsey in the nose.  Everything is so well integrated, its amazing...great punch of Brett, awesome fruity characters, nice toasty malt, oaky, vinous, just brilliant.

Oaky, white wine qualities come through strong in the flavor and combine very nicely with the ale yeast and brett properties. Some sourness in the flavor and a lingering, delicate bitterness in the finish. Complex and very interesting. This is what beer is about.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

Original rating (Batch 001): This belgian strong definitely has the characteristics of an ale aged in chardonney barrels - the taste is dominated by white grapes.  Some citrus and poppy flavors are also present.  Very smooth.","San Francisco, California, USA","MrDick"

Sampled on 7/8/2009. This Sour ale pours a medium yellow gold color from a 375ml bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is bretty, fruity and sweet. A medium bodied sour ale. The malts are fruity and sweet, tart, funky and sharp. A touch of chardonnay like grapes. Lively carbonation. Nice balance. Funky, crisp and dry. Lots of brett at the finish. This beer has aged very nicely in the bottle, it is drier and funkier than at first. Wish I had a few more of these. Maybe time to age some of the newer batch.  Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and dry. Aftertaste is slight bitter and funky.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

Very lively mouthfeel decieves the lack of head, almost like licking a 9 volt, practicaly dances of the tongue.  Notes of barnyard, wheat, lemon, rye and spices, remided me of a saison crossed with a german wheat.  Farly thin bodied and very refreshing.

It poured a mildly cloudy golden color...the best way to describe it is uriney colored with absolutely no head. The aroma effervesced a malty sweetness..almost wheat like...but ohhhhhh that caramel malt backbone how i love thee!!! The taste begins with a fruity and malty sweetness based on that caramel base,, and ends with a good sour and yet balanced sweet aftertaste. This is somewhat achieved through a grapefruit-like acidic ending..very nice. And that was just the first sip!!!!! The next few sips led from more of a belgain strong ale sweetness to more of a German Weisbier....heavy wheat taste, very pleasant...good drying ending but not overwhelming..but an excellent body and a nice silky carbonation level that blended well with the sourness. As i drank the aroma of fruit, malt and wheat grew in intensity and so did the Temptation of this whopper. Oh mama was this good!!!

Hazy deep golden.  Pinappley brett character atop an oaky vanilla sweet tart.  Tropical fruit note that smells fantastic.  Medium-light body.  Light styrian note as well as a great lightly pineapply hint just before a long finish.  Not aggressively sour, nor is it overly dry, and that makes this acessible and very drinkable.  Pure brilliance, Vinnie!

Wow, my tongue was assaulted by all that was going on this one.  The flavor starts out as a reasonably typical strong blonde belgian, but then it shifts drastically towards a saison-y bite that completely absorbed the residual sweetness left by the first yeast.  Amazingly complex, too much going on here for me to describe.  My only advice is to get yourself to the Toronado in San Francisco before this ones gone.
