SABOR de entrada dulce, las notas de vainilla dominan, atrás algo del caramelo quemado y ligeramente toffee, en medio el sabor de la madera ahumada, tenue pero presente, amargor como de un café americano, y de manera más discreta frutos oscuros como pasas y ciruela además de chocolate dulce. En el retrogusto queda un amargor medio, nuevamente como si fuera un café americano, con buena persistencia de sabores tostados, ahumados y dulces como vainilla.

SENSACIÓN: cuerpo medio con sensación sedosa en boca, baja carbonatación. El alcohol no se siente a pesar de la graduación, apenas una sensación cálida en garganta al pasar el trago, y eso cuando la cerveza toma más temperatura.

Moderate dark tan foamy head leaves decent lacing. 2/3FLAVOR: Standard brown ale base of dark malts with no roasted/burnt flavors.

Excellent thick and syrupy palate. Very well done from DFH. Unique, bold, high octane but good tasting brew.

It pours like the most beautiful imperial stout. Pitch black with gigantic chocolate and roasted aroma. Subtle coffee and caramel toffee as well. Theres an undeniable whiskey aroma here and it really stands out as this beer warms up. The taste is big and bold and in your face with so many complex flavors. You get a massive amount of whiskey, vanilla, chocolate and coffee taste. Really delicious. This is a big beer and you can feel it but its not overwhelming but its definitely there. You can see where the lines cross between a roasty brown ale and a big malty imperial stout.

The aroma is big on barrel character with vanilla and a little woodiness. There is also a nice malty complexity that I love. The flavor is a little more balanced. There is a nice bourbon note at the front and solid barrel throughout. The malts and caramel really pop on the back end and it's pretty good. The mouth feel is a bit thin, not a whole lot of carbonation leading off to a mild somewhat roasty aftertaste.

Ősereje az aromák terén is beigazolódni látszik; ha a túlérett gyümölcsök aszalványait brandyben és whiskyben áztatnánk, majd nemes fa füstjén pörkölnénk meg kissé, ezt követően pedig csokoládé-vanília fagylalt legjavában hempergetnénk meg, akkor kapnánk valami hasonló végeredményt. Tovább nem is ragozom. Az a fajta ital, ami teret enged a tapasztalásnak, korlátoktól mentesen indulhatunk el az ízlelés ösvényén, majd minden korty alkalmával szakíthatunk egyet az utunkat szegélyező termésekből. Az olyan exkluzív adalékok, mint a paraguayi Palo Santo fán történő érlelés megtette a hatását; stílusos és kifinomult ízvilágát körülöleli egy klasszikus eleganciát biztosító fahordós karakter, amelyből aztán vaníliás, dohányos, prémium kategóriás alkoholok jegyei szűrődnek ki, hogy ezekhez sejtelmesen csatlakozzon egy jótékony imperial stoutos, kávés-étcsokoládés karakter annak földes jellemvonásaival, majd egy mogyorós, diós, pirított magvas szerkezet az édeskés hangulatokat magán hordozva.","HUNGARY","adster"

Wow! Cant get over how thick this stuff pours, like a pale sump oil-looking liquid making its journey into the glass. 
Aroma is rich, fortified wine-like, with plenty of raisins, dried fig, dark chocolate, burnt nuts, thick dark toffee, seared red meat character, charred oak, and an almost rancio-like aged character you tend to get with older beers.
The stuff is properly thick, not just syrupy, not just oily, but chewable, with a low carbonation accentuating this.
Big flavours on the palate with bucket loads of browned caramel, charred nutty wood, dried fruits, earthy leafy hop, cocoa - so much going on! Solid bitter note on finish, booze is warming, not shy but welcoming.

 Poured from bottle into snifter

 Appearance  Pours a nearly black color with a small one finger tan head. The head fades quite fast to leave a light level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is sweet and boozy. A strong dark fruit aroma of raisin, grape, and prune are big and bold matched only by a good wiff of alcohol. Mixed with these aromas are some lighter aromas of a woody nature as well as some smells of vanilla and some roasted malt and chocolate. Overall quite robust and delicious.

 Taste  The beer is not as sweet as would have been detected from the nose. While not as sweet as expected it is as boozy as would be expected from the nose. The taste begins with a lightly fruit sweetened taste with a big roasted malt and a dark bready taste. As the taste moves on, a woody and oaky flavor comes to the tongue with some lighter tastes of vanilla and a bourbon like alcohol taste. While the alcohol is lighter in the middle of the taste it gains strength as the flavors move on. In the end the alcohol is rather strong; leaving a warming and light oaky bourbon burn on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The beer is thick and creamy in body with a lower to medium level of carbonation. Its thick body suits well the very warming nature of the beer.

 Overall  Pretty boozy but it is nice and warming and has some wonderful flavors. This is definitely a sipping beer.","","Darkmagus82"

There seems to be a smokiness and almost a coffee feeling to the flavor. Heavy after taste which is ok. Kind of creamy and thick in the mouth. Are they sure this isnt a stout???

Palate - chewy, syrupy mouthfeel with a heavy body. Long, sweet, fruity bitter aftertaste.

The pronounced alcohol smell is mirrored as strongly in the taste. The 12% ABV is very apparent, but well mingled and balanced within the sweet vanilla / caramel and the roasted grain flavors.

Look: pours a deep black. A dark brown head evaporates to brown spider webs. That hangs around the rim.
Smell: coffee, with a bitter hops smell
Taste: first sip has a smokey bacon flavor. Definite taste of alcohol from the start (even when chilled). When chilled slight hint of chocolate, coffee, and cherries.

2676,"2013-09-30",4.5,"(4/29/13) Pours a thick dark brown, a finger of dense mocha foam.

Malt sweetness and a bit of bitterness, along with a woody/sawdust aroma from the Palo Santo wood. Very pleasant nose on this one.

Really unique. Sweet bready malt. Balanced bitterness. Creamy caramel and vanilla. Earthly, woody dryness on the finish. A bit of boozy heat comes on the finish as well, but it is quite pleasant. The Palo Santo wood adds a really unique, dry, sweet, bitter, nutty characteristic.

Medium to thick body. Very creamy.

Easily the best brown ale Ive had. The Palo Santo wood just adds to the brown ale characteristics. It tastes almost as if it is bourbon barrel aged because its got the heat, the caramel and vanilla, and the woodiness. For 12% this one goes down very easy, dangerously easy.","","Lognar"

The head comes up upon a tilt of the glass and leaves beautiful legs and quickly disappearing faint lace. Pretty. Nose is roasted coffee, and bitter chocolate with a coldness right out of the fridge. A little grass on top. The roasted coffee is strong and deep. Then a woody aroma that is pure wood. Smells soft and bends around the nose, very supple. Roasted malt, caramel but brown sugar. Not sugary, sugar. So authentic. Theres some nutty accents and a tiny bit of vanilla that smells very fresh. A  bit of alcohol on the nose and a light grass. The nose continues to deepen and evolve. The coffee and the chocolate marry one another and become entwined in sweet harmony. The one is never without the other in the drink. The chocolate sweetens and the malt deepens. A bit of cherry develops and it compliments the wood and earthiness. The taste is unexpected. Your first taste after smelling the coldness right from the fridge is a warming sweet brown bread. Theres sugar, and sweet creamy chocolate. The roasted coffee glides over the palate as easily as your morning cup. The vanilla excites the richness of both the coffee and the chocolate and the malt is smooth and mellow. The wood notes translate into the drink and lend to the overall freshness. The hops stay grass like. The tiny bit of alcohol is simply warming in the drink and pokes its head out only on the finish where you meet those cherry notes one more time. Finishes dry. 

This a beer that continues to develop in the glass and in the drink. Its smooth and yet it enlivens the palate and the senses. It grows on you and you like it more and more as you drink. The flavors are deep and perfected. The malt in this is superlative. It flows smoothly as the flavors become unbounded and always near at hand.","New York, USA","pinkie"

2676,"2013-05-14",3.8,"2013/05/14 - Pours an opaque dark brown (almost black) with a creamy tan head the dissipates quickly but laces nicely. Aroma is dark fruits, vanilla, caramel and alcohol. Taste is dark fruits, caramel and coffee with a boozy finish. Mouthfeel is medium (thinner than expected) with sharp carbonation and a warming finish.

2676,"2013-05-10",3.9,"Pours almost black with a minimal tan head that dissipates quickly. Intense aroma of sweet dark fruits, slight alcohol, maybe some chocolate and bourbon. Taste matches aroma. Although alcohol is more hidden. Mouthfeel is thick with some sharp, stinging carbonation. Very heavy beer that takes awhile to get down. Well crafted, but was not really my thing.

2676,"2013-04-30",3.7,"A - Pours a dark cola brown with a small tan head that dissipates into a wispy patch of bubbles.

S - Raisins, dark fruits soaked in alcohol, hints of vanilla and flowers as it warms.

T - Charred woody malt, brown sugar, prune juice, dry roasted coffee beans, smokey cocoa, burnt maple, minor hints of vanilla extract. Bittering hops start in the middle and follow through to the finish. A robust woody note coats the entire mouth. Some perfume-like character toward the finish. Finishes slick but quickly dries out.

M - Full bodied, low carbonation, syrupy at times but dry at times as well. Alcohol doesnt show like it does in the aroma.

Very complex. Not as much vanilla as I thought would be there. Aftertaste is a multitude of varying flavors. This is of course a sipper. The drinkability is pretty high for the alcohol. A fun beer to explore.

Il y a un parfum vraiment unique qui me fait énormément travailler.  Je sens de la réglisse et/ou des épices et/ou de la vanille et/ou autre chose dassez indiscernable.  Serait-ce la présence de ce bois sacré, le palo santo, cet arbre de la famille des Zygophyllacées qui donne cette touche unique?  Il me semble bien que oui.  Enfin, pour moi, la surprise de cette singularité est totale.  La première gorgée surprend tout autant.  Je suis ici en présence dune bête férocement intense.  Des malts totalement ténébreux qui sagitent dans un alcool poivré, floral et résineux.  Quelque chose aussi comme une liqueur de prunes noires qui, dans son élégante puissance, chasse les quelques signaux de fumée qui apparaissent ici et là.  Véritablement, une tempête de saveurs dans une barrique vaste comme un océan.  En bouche, fort heureusement, les bulles développent un système efficace qui confère une belle agilité à ce corps tout en rondeur.  La texture, visiblement liquoreuse, rappelle à mon cerveau que cette dégustation doit avancer avec lenteur.   En finale, je note plusieurs choses mais finalement je ne retiens que lessentiel.  Beaucoup de saveurs boisées et un alcool chaud qui semble porter toutes les déclinaisons possibles de lamertume.

On the nose dark raosty malts and fragrant esters can be a bit overwhelming, if you are not expecting it.   Mouthfeel is heavy and tends to lend to a bit syrupy, but not to degrade the experience.

The alcohol heat was present, but worked well with the malt bill and the good kick of thick roast and dark chocolate.

2676,"2012-08-25",3.6,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.

A: Pours an almost pitch black color with very little light coming through. Very little head to speak of, aside from a very thin tan-colored collar. A brown ale that thinks its an imperial stout? This now has my attention. 

S: Caramel, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, booze, and oak comprise the aromatic qualities. Faint, but forgivable given its lack of head.

T: The flavor sees an uptick in the nuttiness befitting a brown ale, especially on that first sip. Caramel, roasted coffee, licorice, toffee, and vanilla make an appearance on the midtaste and finish, but it could stand to be a touch more complex. The aftertaste has a good amount of darker fruits and anise, but otherwise, the general flavor profile gives off a vibe of spiked hazelnut coffee. Pretty damn boozy and tannic. Honestly, this could pass for a fruitier imperial stout along the lines of Stone IRS, rather than a rinky dink, run of the mill brown ale. Id call it out on not having enough in the way of roastiness, but you know, brown ale, and stuff...

M: Id call it medium bodied, perhaps ever so slightly erring on the side of light. Weakly carbonated, like I expected. The finish and aftertaste tries to strike a balance between tannic dryness and sticky wetness, and just about pulls it off, right before the tannins fade a little on the palate. Booze isnt particularly stealthy, so sip this one, preferably at a higher temperature. EDIT: It actually becomes quite hot at a higher temperature, so Im lowering the score here. Yeesh, this is practically burning.

O: Ive heard of porters that think theyre stouts, but a brown ale that thinks its an imperial stout? In its current state, its pretty damn enjoyable, but still too young and hot. This could become great with a year of age, and its readily available/cheap-ish enough (for what it is, $15/4 pack isnt chump change) to make picking up a 4 pack to age a worthy endeavor.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

2676,"2012-07-24",4.1,"I initially tried Palo Santo Marron at a tasting hosted by Sam Calagione. He introduced it as ""one of the best beers I have ever made."" If that isnt intriguing to a beer lover, and especially a fan of Dogfish Head, what is? I was blown away with the quality of my one inch beer ration, and also mournful that this brew would not be available for the forseeable future. Now, much to my delight, it is here at last.

This review is from the original bottling date Feb 11, 2008. Taken from my cellar.

A: Very dark brown and rich, almost black, like an imperial stout

S: High abv% slightly evident in the nose, though much less so than a fresh bottle. rich brown ale and wood aromas

T: Delicious. Although the alcohol is present in the aroma, it is well disguised in the taste. I think the time spent in the cellar has mellowed this beer out. The Palo Santo wood creates a pleasant lingering aftertaste.

M: Smooth and easy, perhaps too easy!

D: A great beer to share with someone, although, since it does go down quite easy, considering it is 12%, you could enjoy one all to yourself, as well.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

T- Sweet but not cloying, roasty but not stouty, amazingly little boozyness, absolutely delicious.

A: Pitch black with a fine tan coating on top. Absolutely perfect in my snifter.

S: Whoa, this is one unique aroma, mildly sweet of a woody earthy aroma, roasted malts, caramel, vanilla, honey, and nuts. This is complex and very appealing and unlike anything Ive ever experienced thanks to the Palo Santo wood, while being strangely familiar.

T: A mildly nutty brown ale flavor makes the intro hinting at honey and vanilla as an interesting wood flavor makes the mid-taste, the finish comes on strong with alcohol hitting, but mainly warming the throat. This is incredibly easy to drink for the alcohol.

M: Thick with hints of fizzy carbonation.

2676,"2012-06-26",4.6,"02/02/12, 12 oz bottle into a DFH signature glass.

A - Pitch black body, a two finger high mocha head forms. Moderate lacing and retention, has some alcoholic legs to it.

S - Wood. But not any lumber yard special, no, no. This is some fancy wood. Im not exactly a wood connoisseur so Ill just leave it at ""pallo santo wood"". This ""wood"" has a certain sweetness and spice to it that works really well on top of some traditional brown ale notes. Brown sugar and caramelized bananas is what really stands out though. In the background there is coffee, vanilla and cocoa powder against lightly roasted malts with a slight mineral thing going on. The aroma is so complex and unique, but its coming off like a barrel aged bananas foster themed beer. 

T - It starts off very stout like with roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, oak, and chocolate. But then comes this mildly bitter yet sweet wood favor that is fruity yet smokey and dense. Again, bananas foster. Just as complex and unique as the nose, but less satisfying. It does leave an aftertaste in the mouth that is woody. The mouth feel is medium bodied and syrupy with a high level of carbonation. There is a touch of complimentary warming alcohol, but it doesnt interfere at all.

O - Dogfish Head is just so damn unique. Ive had this beer a few times, including a bottle that was about 3 years old. I think I prefer it fresh.

Su máxima es hacer cervezas fuera de lo común y por lo que se comenta  no lo puedo juzgar porque por los motivos comentados no tengo la posibilidad de probar muchas  su técnica es excelente.

Esta cerveza en concreto, que adelanto que es maravillosa, es de un color marrón muy oscuro, con una espuma densa marrón persistente.

En seguida se perciben aromas tostados y de chocolate, muy agradables, así como las notas del envejecimiento en madera.  Al probarla es una auténtica explosión de sabor , con todo ese chocolate, caramelo, madera, dulce y amargo.

Es una cerveza con poco gas, como pasa con las envejecidas en madera, aunque esto no es un problema. De textura masticable, pica un poco en la boca si la dejas ahí, que es cosa de cada cual , porque alguno pensará que para qué vas a dejarte una cerveza en la boca en vez de tragártela.

2676,"2012-03-13",3.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/26/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a DFH signature glass.

While it was pouring out of the bottle I could tell that this was going to be a thick and viscous beer. The color is a mahogany or ebony, nearly black with almost no light getting through. A dark tan cap rests on top of the beer and retains very nicely for a beer of this ABV.

The aroma is full and deep, but it is not overly complex of out of. The roasted malt gives off caramel, burnt brown sugar, roasted grains, cocoa, and a bit of alcohol.

The flavor starts with a combination of caramel and burnt brown sugar, twisting the sweetness in a different direction. Toasted grains and cocoa come through next. A bit of vanilla precedes the nice dry woody flavor toward the end. A little bit different than oak, this must be the influence of the Palo Santo wood. Just a bit of booze peaks through toward the end. The finish is lightly sweet and a little woody at the same time.

There is no doubt about the fullness of this body. Slightly sticky, with a bit of oily residue after each sip; both of these sensations are quite common for big ABV beers, so no lost points there. The carbonation is creamy and contributes to the smoothness, although it is a bit understated. 

I thought this was another good take on the American Brown style from Dogfish Head. Indian Brown is a better beer, in my opinion, but there are not a lot of 12% brown ales out there. Its definitely a compliment that Sam can brew a big, tasty beer in a category that normally sees more mild releases.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
2676,"2012-03-11",3.5,"Pours a solid black, no head to be found. Alcohol is very present in the smell, along with a warming wood aroma.

But it also tastes like a good stout. Not really roasty, more chocolate and woody, with very strong alcohol burn. Really tasty, does great with a few months of cellaring, and can also hold up in the cellar for long periods.

Update: sampled a 2 year old cellar bottle. Compared to a fresh version the aroma was much better. Flavor was drier overall, softer carbonation, more alcohol taste, and a more prominent spice note from the wood. I like the cellared version better, but its not really worth aging.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"

2676,"2011-10-18",3.9,"Bottle I acquired from daknole over 2 1/2 years ago. Pours a deep, opaque brown with a thin cocoa head that drops quickly to an island of bubbles at the surface and spotty lace on the glass. The nose is big and malty with a sweet spiciness, vanilla, creme brulee with some cinnamon, and a sweet woodiness unlike cherry, oak or any other wood addition Ive encountered. Medium-bodied and oily slick with a sweet finish transitioning to a woody, and just slightly hoppy bitter finish/aftertaste. The flavor is quite sweet, possessing many of the same sweet and spicy complexities found on the nose with the addition of a pronounced ashiness and a significantly drying woody finish. This is some really interesting stuff. The wood helps to counterbalance the significant sweetness, but overall, I found the otherwise pleasant wood note to be a bit overbearing after the swallow. Among the DFH ""experiments"" that Ive tried this one fall into the success category. Unlike any other beer that Ive tried it also possesses the admirable quality of being pretty tasty.

Pitch black with a small, quarter inch head that fades to a thin covering.

smells like dried fruit; raisins and plums. Some wood and maybe a slight bit of alcohol.

Definitely a roasted flavor that I did not pick up on in the smell. Also quite a bit of dark fruit and not as much wood as I was expecting. It is there but not to the degree I have tasted in other wood aged beers. Alcohol is fairly well hidden.

It poured a dark black with a brown head and had a far less strong alcohol taste than Id have expected.  Very malty.

Best complement is that little alcohol burn despite being 12% abv. 

With some more restraint, this couldve been a great beer, but is quite lacking due to fundamental immaturity of approach.

The pour is expectedly ugly, viscous with little head, but the smell sets you up for the boozy ride ahead:  peppery, malt, and grain alcohol all collide in your nose, failing to ease any trepidation.  And, while the unbelievable amount of sweet and decadent flavors are produced by this dark, thick liquid, their lack of subtlety eventually kills their appeal.  Theres a nutty base underlying everything, while raisins, bread pudding, caramel, and vanilla ice cream float across your palate. Everything is accompanied by an alcohol-and-pepper mouthfeel, huge and filling, to the point of overload.

Milk and dark chocolates hit the palate first and then a spicy, white pepper tingle the back of the tongue.  Im assuming this is from the Palo Santo wood and its just an awesome flavor!  Theres also an earthy mustiness and woody dryness that completely tames the lightly prune flavored sweetness and balances it perfectly.   Its really hard to believe that this is 12% ABV.

The flavor is of roastiness, and fermented wood. But honestly now that Im toward the bottom of the glass the alcohol is kicking in pretty strong, especially on the finish.

2676,"2011-03-16",4.0,"12 oz bottle bottled on 12/06/10.

IT pours inot my snifter a dark brown, pretty much black with a foamy tan head that sticks for a nice bit of time and leaves delicate lacing.

The smell is a bit alcoholic with a good whiff but it also has some unique wood tones to it. I love exotic wood aged beers and this one in particular has a nice quality to it. There is also some roasted flavors and chocolate in the smell.

The flavor also has a major dose of wood and alcohol. The wood provides some tannic and almost spicy notes. The alcohol meld with the sweetness of the malts for a warming overtone. In between thsi is loads of dark chocolate with a moderately sweet dry finish.

They packed a lot of flavor into this one and although it is a bit sweet and cloying, the wood mellows it and it becomes a fine beer.

3 Burnt ashy aroma, noxious volatiles too, boozy. Generally quite unpleasant.
4 Very dark red, small tight head settles to a tan ring.
3+ Retronasals so hot that I think if I were to sniff out onto a naked flame Id be like a flame-thrower. Taste very ashy, and solventy too. Not just alcohol, but acetone.
2 Sticky palate, OK carbonation. Godawful finish, very ashy and astringent. Drying. Burning in my mouth from the combination of pure booze, astringent ashiness, and unbalanced bitterness. This isnt unbalanced - its the exact opposite of balance. Anti-balanced.
7 A way for idiots with too much money to get drunk. Sorry, but even your average eastern european malt liquor is way more drinkable than this. Utterly devoid of anything which I recognise as essential to a beer. For a laugh, I poured out a pissy pale lager, to see which one I prefered to drink, and, to be honest, this was better than the really bad pale lager. For even more of a laugh, I blended different ratios of the two, and at about the 50/50 mark, it was an almost tasty drink (2.4-ish).","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
2676,"2011-03-11",4.5,"Pours viscus and black.  Lots of roasty notes, vanilla, alcohol, some wood.  Very low carbonation.  Head was small and very dark khaki.  Tastes of velvety chocolate cake (quite rich) some cedar notes in between the alcohol burn.  Finishes seltzer like and a bit tart.  Having a hard time describing this one.  Unique and very well done.  After drinking one of these, I am not sure I am on earth anymore.  Has the effects of smoking an entire crippie joint by yourself.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","IPAsavedMYlife"
2676,"2011-03-11",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2012 I am so glad I retried this beer. Scent is powerful wood notes and light roast.

2676,"2011-03-10",3.9,"Tasted in late February 2011 from a 12oz bottle purchased at Plaza Liquors, bottled on 2/11/08.  Pours an opaque dark thick brown with a tint of amber and an average tan head that recedes very slowly to a thin but even lace and collar.  The nose is fruity with cola, chocolate, very malty with some roast, vanilla, and light coffee.  The flavor is much darker and more roasted.  It is fruity and cola up front, moving to dark chocolate, coffee bitterness, vanilla, and more roast on the back.  The body is full and creamy with lighter carbonation and a long roasted and vanilla finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

2676,"2011-03-07",3.3,"Pours like a stout but with a thin head.  Not as black as a black lager, but thicker so appears as dark with more of a mahogany darkness.  You can definitely smell and taste the use of the wood.  Not a typical brown ale, thats for sure.   Alcohol is not over-whelming but am a fan of high ABVs.  Great caramel notes and great overall taste.   Would buy again.","Minnesota, USA","SDMNguy"
2676,"2011-03-07",4.1,"Pours a very dark, oily brown with thin to medium-sized head. Complex mixture of flavors, with a very pronounced licorice in the forefront. Some vanilla and caramel also. Rather sweetish, very thick beer with a high alcohol content. Certainly worth a try.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
2676,"2011-03-05",3.1,"Certainly an interesting drop, but not sure Id have another. Like a woody ""old style"" porter (lightly soured, and a little acrid in a nice way), but with a little liqorice. Surprised to see so many very high ratings for this beer here. Maybe I just dont get it.  Anyway, good, but just this one bottle for me I think.","Hamilton, NEW ZEALAND","greig"
2676,"2011-03-05",4.1,"This may be one of my favorites from the Dogfish crew, the other is Burton Baton. This beer has an almost sweet caramel and vanilla aroma.

This tops my former favorite beer, New Belgium 1554.  Yes, it looks like motor oil, but it tastes like paradise.  Very heavy.  Almost syrupy mouthfeel...but if you know that going in, it doesnt matter.  Alcohol kicks you in the head after about three sips.  Maybe thats why my review is glowing so brightly!","Shawnee, Kansas, USA","Airlifter"
2676,"2011-03-04",3.2,"Pours very dark brown with a brown head. The aroma is prunes, nuts,  noticeable acetylhyde, and a little bit of fruit cake.The flavor is sweet, alcoholic, and fruity with the woodiness coming through in the very finish, but in a strong way. Theres a slight nuttiness that reminds me of a rich pecan pie for some reason, but not as good as that sounds. This was a little rough and sloppy for me.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
2676,"2011-03-01",2.8,"never had anything quite like this before.  kind of looks scary, like transmission fluid.  at 12% A.B.V. it initially frightened the mouth.  sampled one, and didnt have another brew that session.  I couldnt.  more wood than a forest.  dont get me wrong.  it was very, very different.  if only i could get the slivers out of my mouth.  be brave.  this one is definitely worth the experience.","KAMLOOPS, British Columbia, CANADA","yogibeerra"
2676,"2011-02-26",3.6,"Pours a midnight black in color with a tan head. Head fades quickly leaving a slim wisping of cover behind. This is much darker than you would expect a brown ale to be. I would say more of an imperial stout in color, except darker.
Slightly phenolic. A little sour and sweet at the same time. Hints of dates, caramel and molasses. Nicely done. But not a brown ale.
Sweet, a slight twang from the sour aroma present. I assume from the wood it was aged in. Big alcohol presence. A bit of the caramel and molasses comes through again. And a bitterness not to be confused with the sourness. A bit of roastiness. Not too bad. Again, not a brown ale.
An oiliness left in my mouth. But soon cut through by the bitterness and sourness. That is what is left until I take another drink. Especially the sour twang. Still not a brown ale.
Fairly drinkable given the super high ABV for a brown ale. Good thing they mislabeled this thing. Because it is definitely not a brown ale. If you want a lighter imperial stout, then this is what you would reach for. If you want a brown ale, youll confused. Not a brown ale.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

A little oxidized in flavor...a touch of flabbiness...but otherwise..licorice, licorice, and some more licorice...and maybe a touch of chocolate...and some more licorice.  Let m3 mention that I quite enjoy licorice, so I am surely not upset.

2676,"2011-01-30",4.2,"Bought a case in march 2009 and kept half in my celler.  That really mellowed it out.  Love the brown head.  The strong soy sauce aroma I disliked before has really mellowed out to more of a heady, roasty earth blast.  It seems to have more of a nutty overtone now.  Before it was definitely sweeter, I would say merlot-ish.  Now I suppose it could be like a victorian stout or something.  Glad I let it sit down there and get dusty because it was kinda overwhelming at first. That time-out behind the furnace really let it calm down.

Smells like one too, coffee/bitter chocolate on the nose accompanied by powerful notes of Santo Palo wood. Very nice aroma. The taste is beastly, huge roasted notes with some dark coffee along with massive woody flavors. High ABV is present here and makes itself well known.

2676,"2011-01-22",3.5,"Bottle; Pour is a dark brown with tan head. Retention is on the average side. Very light lacing in this snifter - On the nose there is at first a mineral feel. What is obvious is the Palo Santo wood as well - Its obvious because its clearly not oak. This brew had a metallic taste initially;  it disappeared as it warmed. It was nearly cloying as well - which also disappeared as it warmed. The wood as well as a general earthy feel is very present, there is a sweet yet bitter acetic cherry note, a chocolate note rears its head, and the brew tends to end on the bitter side while coupling with a boozy feel as well. I appreciate the unique experience here; it didnt quite make it for me, however.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Taste: Light sweet, medium bitter, medium sour. Burnt embers, black liquorice, Buckleys cough syrup, slight citurs note. Finish is surprisingly light and not overly long, but the power of the alcohol probably masks it. To high an ABV for me, it just doesnt allow the body to truly open up and the thickness of it masks the wood influence.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","Powertrip"
2676,"2011-01-12",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2011 Bottle. The pour was a murky dark brown almost black with a small (less than 1 finger) light brown head that dissipated rapidly and had fair lacing.

The aroma was quite robust with the scent of roasted caramel malts and a mild sweet yeast with hints of vanilla and coffee with a mild alcohol odor at the back end.

The taste was a malty creamy sweet with notes of coffee, caramel and was a tad woody at first and finished sweetly-bitter and had nice notes of coffee and vanilla with mild alcohol aftertaste. The flavor lingered for a little while which let one enjoy the sweet woody coffee taste just a little longer.

Mouthfeel was just a bit under full in body and slightly syrupy yet a little creamy in texture with a mild ticklish carbonation.

2676,"2011-01-07",3.3,"Smell is sweet raisin, mollasses, cherry. From reading the description I assume I smell the Palo Santo as it is woody and just kinda similar to oak but not. Alcohol present. Very complex. Appearance is almost black with a hint of dark brown. Very small tan head. Syrupy pour. Taste is raisin, mollasses, coffee, chocolate, caramel, cherry, ashy. Definate tartness that goes well with strong syrupy sweeetness and roasty darkness. Pronounced woody flavor that I will again asume is the Palo Santo. Palate is thick and very complex. Hot and kinda harsh. This guy would really benefit from some aging. Overall an interesting beer. The wood is very different and I think what makes this beer unique. Overall, while this beer is nice, Im not in love with it as it is almost cloying and the alcohol is a little harsh.

2676,"2011-01-05",4.1,"I can absolutely understand why this wood is used in wine-making.  Thankfully, I like beer better than wine.  One could definitely anticipate the malty impact-the aroma is one of (dark) chocolately coffee (guess that would be mocha?).  lt is dark black with a tan frothy head, that sitcks around as long as you would like a good date to do so.  Nice lacing, which remains so you know you are drinking a good beer to the very last drop.  Very nice palate, though a bit too sharp?  Perhaps if it could be reduced by a few hundred bubbles, It would smooth out to the perfect palate for the beer.  Buuuuut, I wouldnt work too hard to try and change this for fear that it would overcorrect.  

I always get insecure in trying to describe the taste because there is so much too it...many of which I know I will miss.  I will at least give this generalization, its great!  A detailed bouquet of malty-ness.  Roasted coffee with a smooth dark-chocolately (but not too high cocoa content) intro.  It lingers on your tongue like a nice chocolate bar would!  

If it gets too warm, there is a slight after taste of ""wet dog.""  That sounds a whole lot worse than it is though.  It is still in my top 5 favorite beers.  Perhaps top 3 as whenever it is available, it is my preferred drink for the occasion.  Not to be a cop-out, but this is definitely one that must be reevaulated, because Ive finished the beer before I was able to formulate all of my descriptives for taste and aroma.","Memphis, Tennessee, USA","Hops4MyHips"

This blends well with the whole bouquet and compliments the notes of vanilla and aged rum. The flavor is nutty and a bit spicy, quite a good bit like the spices in anchor Christmas ale (woody, zesty, potpourri like in a way) As the glass progresses dark fruits show up with some nice roastiness and a good bit of heavily toasted French oak.

Aroma is of, to me, a cedar tree.  I think shade in summer or the only scent in winter.  This must be the Palo Santo barrels.  Musty, dank, rich, roasty and sweet.

Appearance is stouty--black.  The alcohol is apparent in the pour.  Very little head.  

Taste is slightly sweet and slightly sour--overridden by earthy.  It evokes solitude, woods, and cold.  And theres a hint of bite from the alcohol.

Syrupy, sticky feel, but thin.  Tingles the tongue.  More oxidized than you might expect a beer that otherwise leaves a syrupy feel on the mouth.  The taste and feel linger long.

2676,"2010-11-04",3.6,"Bottle, 
has a dark brown-ruby pour, it is hard to see through this beer, even at the edges or the bottom of the glass, gave a small dark (chocolate shake)  colored head, left some spotty lacings as I drank, I think the alcohol may have washed off the lacings, no sediment in the bottle, 

I got various alcohol-liquor aromas right off, there were roasted malt, faint coffee, wood-brandy liquor fragrances with Wine and Port, 
this beer somewhat reminds me of a coffee alcohol Impy, there is a sweetness that resembles vanilla and brown sugar, 

there were flavors of liquor alcohol, roasted malt, some brown sugar sweetness, faint coffee, there is a little dark fruit and berry flavor but the alcohol seems to engulf or dilute these flavors, maybe some burnt dark fruit to, 
alcohol is evident on the palate, the alcohol grows a little as the beer warms, and the alcohol dries the tongue after the finish, 

mouth feel is a more than medium, carbonation is soft and stays that way, even as the beer warmed up to room temperature, gives some warmth on the mouth and throat with each sip, and gives a little tingle in the nostrils with some sips, 

this is a strong Winter Warmer sipping beer, I think this beer is better when cool (not cold) but gets a little too much on the alcohol side when it warms up, I found my self getting a little twinge when taking a sip, if you do not mind a lot of alcohol you may enjoy this drink.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

Then you get some dark fruit like raisins and figs, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and wood which tastes quite unigue compared to e.g. oak aged beers (which is because of the palo santo brewing vessels its brewed in).

Smell: Dark fruit, chocolate, wood, alcohol and a light hint of something I can only explain as the smell of grocery store produce department.

Taste: Toasted malt up front followed by a complex mix of chocolate, dried fruit, spices, pepper, smoky oak and burnt toast in the middle and ending with caramel malt and alcohol. The alcohol is kind of similar to cheap vodka. The aftertaste is mostly dark chocolate.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Good drinkability. The alcohol isnt overwhelming, though you wouldnt want to drink too many considering the ABV.

Based on appearance and aroma, Im not sure I wouldnt have guessed this was an imperial stout. Flavor is where it stands apart some. Initially lightly sour, then a quite dusty and complex hay malt flavor. Some light soy notes as well, but really, Im amazed at how the dusty and hay/straw notes prevail here in the flavor. Almost nasally irritating. Very complex and unusual. Moderately bitter finish with some rough-hewn carbonation.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

Dark plum in colour, almost black.  Tan frothy head.  Smells like oak and spicy hops, with a dose of soy sauce.  Tasted like wine-fermenting wood (hence the South American Palo Santo), and very roasty/earthy malts.  Chocolate is there too but only fleeting.

2676,"2010-09-14",4.3,"Poured from the tap with a deep, dark mahogany brown color but only a thin, creamy head. The aroma wasnt too pronounced, but I definitely smelled some of the sweetness and maybe a bit of nuttiness that youd expect from a high-octane brown ale, and only a faint whiff of earthy wood. 
The wonderfully unique woodsy sweetness is much more dominant in the flavor, though, but it isnt so potent as to overpower the other flavors. An underlying nuttiness comes through as well, along with a bit of chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Being fairly finely carbonated, this one has a silky texture and goes down much smoother than would be expected at 12% alcohol.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"
2676,"2010-09-12",3.7,"Brown ales hardly set tongues awagging; the style simply doesnt define itself on extremes.  But this one goes up to eleven.  For colour, its the darkest brown can be without turning black.  The head is off white and quickly lowing, leaving behind some protracted lacing.  On the nose the wood is first to impress.  It does share some of the vanilla qualities of the more commonly used oak, but the palo santo imparts a resinous cherry characteristic that seems particular to it.  The malts are of chocolate and burnt caramel, or toffee.  And then theres something of a fortified wine, a certain vinous element that puts me in mind of chewed grape seeds.  In the mouth the wood is fragrant and adds a bitterness to the malts.  Here the alcohol forms part of the taste profile rather than acting as heat alone.  Chocolate and tobacco round the flavour.  Its syrupy and sticky with a soft carbonation.  The wood develops on the finish to a strong cedar or pine and right at the end theres a nip of cracked black pepper.  Towards the bottom of the glass its like chewing down an old galleon - but as the man said: Its the wood that makes it good.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

2676,"2010-09-05",3.6,"Dark, opaque pour with a sweet, toffee bouquet.  The taste is full-bodied in terms of mouth feel and the warming tingle of alcohol is quite palpable in this malty, woody brew that smacks as well of caramel, chocolate and roasted malt.

The smell on this thing is very nice with hints of cherry, chocolate, cocoa, and fig. The taste is complex and slightly boozy (it is a 12 percenter, after all)...yet the mouthfeel is not cloying or syrupy at all. Bourbon, whiskey, oak-aged berries, smoked lavender are just a few of the many waves of taste that I experienced as I drank this.

This is phenomenal, pick one up to split with a friend and you wont regret it for a second!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Listigovers"
2676,"2010-09-03",3.7,"They call this brown ale. After pouring a glass it seems more appropriate to label as black ale, this thing is dark as any stout would be. Unlike a stout though, my pour produces only the smallest heads that I have to watch quickly dissipate. The aroma is quite strong from the get go. Featuring sweet roasted malts, figs, burnt coffee and intensified by an elegant wood aging scent. The flavor profile is constructed from the Palo Santo wood the beer aged in. Vanilla and caramel notes come off the wood giving way to a dynamic roasted malt concoction. Its bitter sweet and plays off lots of dark burnt malts. The body is silky smooth and juicy. The 12% ABV is hidden pretty well at first, but comes through more pronounced as it warms displaying a brandy like quality to the flavor. Overall, I found this beer to be a delicate sipper, one that needs to be slowly enjoyed to get the full range of flavors. The Paraguayan wood adds an interesting twist to a brown ale displaying a complexity of different flavors. Dogfish Head are so good at taking a normal beer and adding a unique element to give the beer more life, character, and meaning behind it. I would love another of these, particularly one that is several years old.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

The wood is evident in the dryness that it imparts.  Full bodied with creamy and thick texture.  The finish is dry and roasty with some bitterness joining in.  This is a very big beer.  I thought Id had this before, but I would have remembered this one.  My initial thoughts, as it was still fairly cold, was that it is too dry-as I find many oaked beers to be-however, as it warms, the beers sweetness comes out and really balances things out.  As usual, DFH is able to take unusual ingredients and infuse them into the beer for an extraordinary complex and sometime subtle flavor.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"

Put your stones down, I was at a concert and if a great friend is gonna offer me a great beer, and I happen to lack the proper glassware, then Ill just have to ""suffer"" and drink it as it comes.

2676,"2010-08-19",4.7,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. 

Appearance: It has an almost opaque dark brown body with lighter chestnut highlights near the edges of the glass. The pour is deep, dark and thick, making a small light brown head to sit on top. This head fades out quickly however and leaves a thin ring of tan foam lace. A quick swirl gives it a wispy thin film covering and slick lace. 

Smell: The aroma has toasted bready malt, roasted grain, sweet brown sugar and molasses. This gives it a sweet overall character but there is also some fresh cut pine, resin, hops, dark wood and leathery notes. Its alcohol is noticeable as well. 

Taste/Palate: There is a lot of complexity here in this big full bodied beer. There are sweet notes of brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, raisons, and prunes. This is balanced with some floral/woody notes, pine resin, leafy hops and dark hard wood. It also has notes of toasted bread, roasted grain and warm alcohol that give it a bit of bite. This all comes on a heavy, slightly viscous texture with smooth carbonation. 

Notes: Its big and complex with a bit of bite, which should mellow nicely with age. This is a big winner in my book.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

The alocohol is surpisingly not that noticeable in the taste. This could be an IRS judging by the looks, so dark with a slight head.

2676,"2010-08-07",4.9,"I tasted this beer for the first time last night and was completely captivated until the last drop. I poured the beer, as I do most beers of this character, into a wine glass meant for Barolo. Although I knew this was a brown ale, I was taken aback by just how opaque this beer actually was. Only mildly carbonated, the beer had a thin, brown head that dissipated after a few minutes.

On the nose, this beer was massive, intense and complex. I got tons of near-burnt toast, a bit of vanilla, caramel and dried dates (think a rich brown ale with a bit of Amarone della Valpolicella in it) along with the typical coffee notes you get in beers brewed with roasted barley.

This beer had an amazingly rich mouthfeel and definitely had a sweet character to it, though never going out of balance. The ageing on Palo Santo wood no doubt helped to add richness, depth and that vanilla character to the beer. There was also a slight nutty aspect on the finish that was simply gorgeous. Had I brewed this beer, I would have dry-hopped it more: Im glad I didnt brew it. To me, this beer was absolutely perfect and, even though Im just back from a month-long micro-brew binge in the US, it was one of the best things Ive tasted in a very long time.

This beer held the high alcohol like a champ and there was no burning sensation, nor did it taste overly alcoholic. Dogfish Head have shown once again that they can brew very high gravity beers while managing to hide the alcohol under layer after layer of rich deliciousness - (certain Belgian brewers should take note).

6.25 is no small price for a bottle of beer, but if this were a wine it would be in the 40-60 range without a doubt. As such, this is a definite buy. Bravo!","IRELAND","DMarra"

2676,"2010-07-31",4.1,"Served in a trappist glass.  Pours an opaque, dark brown, with a thin tan head that dissipates relatively quickly.  Copious amounts of lacing remain behind, however.  Aroma is dense, but alcohol absolutely dominates.  Lets be clear, however, the alcohol is not indiscriminate; rather, it is strongly characteristic of brandy or cognac.  Beyond that, some toasted caramel malts are barely discernible.  Flavor is, again, driven by alcohol.  But as the beer warms, other flavors become more apparent, including some sweetness associated with burnt sugar and vanilla.  Mouthfeel is somewhat thick, but not overly viscous, with a mild hint of carbonation.  

In all, this is one of Dogfish Heads finest ales.  Its absolutely strong, but imminently drinkable.

Reminded me a fair bit of Islay malt whisky. Intense and complex but still open - its not a crushingly loud beer and although the mix of flavours is unusual, they dont fight each other.

Nose is sweet w/ raisins and red wine w/ a bit of roasted character in the background. Some chocolate and more varied dark fruit notes come out once tasted. A bit sticky and thick but w/ some slightly overzealous carbonation that contrasts oddly. This doesnt finish well, leaving a medicinal, slightly sour old coffee bitterness lingering on the tongue.

On the nose, there are strong notes of wood, coffee and molasses, along with whisky, vanilla, earth and a hint of peat.

2676,"2010-05-04",4.0,"Bottle.

A - Very dark brown, almost black, with ruby brown hues on the edges. Large, thick, frothy, and creamy light sandy beige head with very good retention and a good sized layer of creamy sticky lacing left.

S - This is definitely interesting to smell as it as a number of aromas, some I dont know really what they are. There is a good amount of dark malt smell with caramel and molasses in there and hints of smokiness. There is also some overriding tart/acidic aroma that I dont know what it is or how to significantly explain it.

T - Starts with a bit of dark malt with just hints of dark bread and even fainter hint of chocolate. That quickly gives way to a subtle dark fruit tartness. This then quickly opens up into a smokey, charred wood flavor. Underlying this is some burnt brown sugar and molasses. The finish has a strong peaty/charred wood tasting bitterness along with a fair amount of alcohol, and just the faintest underlying of dark fruit. The peat/charred wood really lingers on the tongue for quite some time. Reminds me a bit of a whisky really.

M - A touch more than medium body with slightly under moderate carbonation. Pretty smooth.

D - The alcohol and wood/peat can get to be a bit heavy after awhile. Definitely a sipper. Probably a good beer to have on occasion, but I dont think Id make a habit of drinking it regularly.

Notes: Bottled on 05/27/09. Definitely an interesting beer that has a strong wood presence. Really this beer was a bit of an enigma for me whether it was trying to determine the aroma or trying to determine if I like it or not. At times I was really enjoying it, and at times I wasnt so sure. Its a beer that Id really have to be in the mood for to have again. The wood/peat and alcohol were a little strong for me, but at times they worked. Those being so prominent reminded me of a whisky at times. Definitely worth a try to see how you feel about it.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

The nose is dark fruit, spice, and a decent dose of booze. The flavor is...not quite indescribable, but...cocoa, maple/molasses, vanilla, licorice, and dark roast counterbalances an almost citrus sweetness. I am reminded of the American tradition of serving espresso with a slice of lemon or a bit of lemon peel. It also drinks hot and boozy; you can sense that 12%.

2676,"2010-04-12",4.2,"first id like to say this is not a seasonal or a special but one of dogfish heads year round beers..taste is reminiscent of a glass of chocolate milk with other subtle flavors of caramel,roasted malt and caramelized sugar,not much bitterness but the wood gives it an unusual mellow flavor also a bit of subtle dark fruit and perhaps sweet wine..tastes more like an impy stout than brown ale but whos complaining powerful,strong alcohol well hidden so be careful,thick and lightly carbonated,yet somehow drinkable,to me kind of a world wide stout lite if youre familiar","Margate City, New Jersey, USA","coolfunnj"

2676,"2010-04-07",3.8,"12 fl. oz. bottle from Party Source (Syracuse), served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. 
App.:  Deep brown-black with a so-so mocha head.
  
Aroma:  Difficult to describe, quiet sweet, floral, perfumed, some chocolatey-vanilla notes, nice roasty malts, some slightly minty herbals, somewhat boozy, fruity, quite interesting.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, fairly sparse yet prickly effervescence, a bit syrupy.
  
Flav.:  A bit darker than the nose, still lots of that sort of rose water, perfumed floral sweet fruitiness, rootbeer-like mintiness, chocolate and vanilla, some molasses and hints of licorice, a definite woody/cedary/cigar tobacco note; quite sweet with decent bitterness and a slighty boozy, slightly tangy fruity malt finish.

Palo Santo Marron isnt a bad beer, but the unique woody flavor suffers from its sweetness for my palate. There is some dryness from the wood, but the mouthfeel is still fairly cloying. The flavor is complex, and there are some good notes in there. Its just all a bit too much. The alcohol is a bit forward for the sweet syrupy feel.

Boozy alcohol aroma hits you hard up front with hints of vanilla. A malty sweet flavor initially followed by a woody charcoal sensation. Very long lingering pleasant aftertaste with alcohol, rum, bourbon, charcoal and earthy wood flavors from the wood. Very complex and interesting. Very thick and syrupy. The alcohol flavor, although pleasant dominates this beer at this age. I have some aged and this will be a great beer to buy year by year and do a vertical tasting. This is a one and done sipping beer. Its complex enough to match any cabernet or fine wine and would be great paired up with a big steak or roast.","Miamisburg, Ohio, USA","chaz01"
2676,"2010-03-21",4.4,"Bottle date February 17, 2009, poured into a wide body Dogfish Head snifter, 13 months in the bottle.

Appearance is near black, extremely dark, would need to be in a shot glass to see any real color density and clarity, with a vigorous pour the head is an inch and a half light brown.

The aroma is very malt forward with a cocoa character, some dried fruit, touch of currants and raisins. Vanilla bean, dark rum and touches of maple sap and raw honey. A wave of alcohol and then earthy wood tones. No hop aroma really to speak of. There is a resinous character that I cant quite put my finger on that can only be realistically attributed to the Palo Santo Wood and it mingles with the alcohol as almost raw tobacco leaf.

The flavor on this beer is just incredible and difficult to wrap your head around, there is a huge warming alcohol that washes the tongue and hits the back of the throat, unlike any other beer I have ever had. The alcohol sensation is akin to chiplote peppers. Usually a heat like this is abrasive or offensive in a beer, but is extremely well received. I pick up some chocolate character, big notes of dark rum, bourbon, raw earthy wood tones, pine sap, maple sap and espresso. Tobacco and slight smokiness. Hop flavor is not something found in this rich complex brew. Bitterness is apparent upfront but washed out by the residual sweetness and the alcohol, leaving a touch in the finish. Touches of roastiness as it warms.

The mouthfeel is full bodied with a very creamy silk smooth texture, semi-sweet finish, but the alcohol warmth provides a counter balance.

This is without a doubt one of the most unique beers you can experience. At this point, a year into the bottle the flavor has so much depth, it will be a fight to keep these aging. It has the character of a imperial stout, but not as thick and sweet. Anything else you drink in the same evening will be mute and meaningless.","New York, USA","PBoegel"

June 26, 2010 - On tap at the Milton Brewery.  Out of the tap the added carbonation better balances the sweet.  The creamier mouthfeel really bumps up the experience with this brew.

2676,"2010-01-16",3.6,"12oz bottle.  Pours very dark brown, almost black with a small brown head.  Reduces to a whispy covering and leaves a little spotty but short-lived lacing.

Mouthfeel is on the thin side, medium carbonation.  Interesting.  Pretty good, but Im not sure if its worthy of the high price.

Sweet and slightly alcoholic

Appearance:
Dark, deep brown

Flavor:
I was really expecting to get a very strong woody flavor, but was pleasantly surprised to get a nice chocolate creaminess. The alcohol wasnt too present despite being 12% ABV. Theres also a subtle hop finish. Overall, it has a very similar flavor to New Hollands Dragons Milk Ale. (A good thing in my book.)

Mouthfeel:
Medium thickness and viscosity. Coats the mouth nicely, but doesnt leave your chest burning.

Overall, its a surprisingly drinkable beer: creamy, hoppy, and packs a punch. Palo Santo ranks as one of my favorite Dogfish brews, though I wouldnt quaff it often.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","megrut"

A: Little head, though it clings well to the glass. A soft brown head, almost cappuccino colored. Very dark in character with red and light brown hues around the edges.
S: A musky smell is in the foreground with a lot of burnt malt scents accompanied by a caramel fragrance. Smells boozy as it warms.
T: There is an initial balance of banana and caramel with a very robust smoky component. Im also getting a sweeter pumpkin spice aftertaste with vanilla.
M: Very thick for a brown ale (reasonably thick for a porter for that matter). Medium carbonation helps this brew attain a creamy quality.

Truly, this is a very, very dark brown liquid, through which no light shall pass. The best you can hope for is a dark ruby tinted brown highlight, at the edges.
Medium pour produces one finger of creamy coffee colored foam. It hangs around for a little bit, but doesnt overstay its welcome. Lacing is pretty darn good, if only a little spotty.

The smell is, well...different. I dont think that Ive smelled another brew quite like this one. All of the charateristic notes are there, they just combine to make a totally unique smell.
Nice maltiness is what got me first. Big notes of caramel and vanilla. Nice big oakiness. Slight booziness. Dark fruits are in abundance. Figs, dates and cherries, mostly. Slight hints of chocolate covered bananas. 

Huge malty sweetness. Burnt coffee. Big dark fruits. Brown sugar and molasses. Nice smooth oakiness. Slight hints of smoke and chocolate. Caramel presence is fairly high. 
There are so many things going on in this bottle. Its really hard to nail it down.
Very tasty and very well done brew.

Very good medium to full body. Nice and oily, in the mouth. Carbonation is low, but just right for this type of beer. It provides a nice level of creaminess, without getting in the way of the flavors.

Excellent dessert beer, here. You probably wont find yourself with the urge to drink a six-pack of these on Friday night, or anything. Its much too big of a beer for that.
Very, very good beer, but mostly for special occasions.

2676,"2009-10-25",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2011 Bottle courtesy of brentfresh. Dark brown pour. Sweet aroma. Fruit and sweet plum. Taste is sweet dry with heavy malts. Tingle on the tongue. Flavor finishes sadder than the Belgian strong I had previous. 3.2
RE-RATE 4/14/11 Bottle from Central Market.  After I let this beer warm on the counter for half an hour or so, I poured it elegantly into my Dogfish Head oversized wine glass. Im so glad I finally get to use this bad boy! It pours very dark brown with a nice tall tannish-brown head. The head lasts for awhile before finally dropping into the drink.

The aroma is pretty strong. Heavy with dark malts and a spicy wood with some light vanilla and aging raisin. Definitely smells like it will be higher in alcohol.

Flavor is sweet flavorful malts and grains, with a candied sugar type flavor. There is a big tingle/warming sensation on the tongue and in the throat. A wood-like flavor is met near the finish of the drink that has some light chocolate and a gentle toastedness. The finish stays with you thoughalmost a burn.

All in all its a pretty good beer with a punchy finish and some very unique flavors. Not an everyday drink, thats for sure!","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

Woody, chocolate and fruit flavor. Cherries and raisins. Coffee and vanilla. Very woody and roasted. Very fruity into the mid-palate, and quite sweet, with vanilla, then this is all washed away by alcohol, which leads to a well-roasted, bitter finish.

There are some distinct hints of brown sugar and candy sugar on the smell. This is also immediately apparent on the taste, though some cinnamon spices come across as well. On the aftertaste the brown sugar certainly dominates. If anything, this is almost a sweet christmas-type strong ale. A rather interesting brown ale on steroids is another way to describe it.

Very dark brown and even the ultra-thin brown film holds on forever giving out some slippery spotty lacing but misses out with no heavy alcohol legs. Nice yumtastic aroma - very sweet and fruity and woody and and and and.. There is a weird licorice / rubbing alcohol / menthol blend (hard to nail down) upfront followed closely by dirt, heated molasses, strong dark fruits, sea salt, fireplace ashes,vanilla, very weak chocolate, figs and a very very nice woody aroma finishing things off that is virtually driving my love for this. Unique aroma that I am very drawn to. Sure, it is not the strongest or most tantalizing but there is so much here that appeals to me - almost soothing. The taste is pretty good but now that Im noticing the alcohol (albeit still subdued) and the fact that I may have let this warm a bit too much I may have missed the optimal window. Liquor, bitterness, wood, tons of roasted malts of medium strength, raisin, bitter chocolate, a bit of syrupy dark berries, earthy, licorice, old crunchy cookies. Seemed better a touch colder. I think I my tongue might just be getting an overdose as I get to the bottom of my glass. Thick and viscous, tons of lingering non hoppy bitterness, ashes, burning wood in the permanent aftertaste.

Flavor is sweet and contains roasted malts, dark chocolate cake, alcohol (brandy).  The Palo Santo wood flavor becomes more prevalent toward the finish which also has a slightly burnt flavor.

The moderate amount of head is thick and sticky and dark-colored, like coffee with cream.  Strong aroma is of roasted malts and some sweetness.  
The first tastes are creamy and of spectacularly roasted malts, along with caramel sweetness that persists throughout the sips, always floating above the roasted malt flavor.  Strong hints of vanilla are here is well as the mouthfeel gives way to an oiliness characteristic of heavy beers.  The alcohol is well hidden until the finish, which reminds me very much of bourbon.

Heavy burst of alcohol singes the nostrils. The oak so heavily advertisted on the label is actually nicely subdued. Any vanilla in the nose is strictly theoretical. The taste is a heavy blast of alcohol, with some serious oak. This all overshadows the second wave of the burnt porter malt in the aftertaste. As it warms, the caramel and vanilla come out like a nice iced coffee. Toward the end, some raisin and dark tobacco. The feel thick and chewy -- and outstanding.

2676,"2009-07-18",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2012 No aging (2009 vintage): Nice and dark for a brown ale. That wood aging really did a number on the color. Aroma of raisins and an unmistakable resinous aroma. This reminds me of something from college. But what, I have no idea. Another unique and fine beer from Dogfish Head. Delicious! (A+)

No aging (2012 vintage): Fresh, this beer is somewhat awkward and is one of those beers that really shouldnt be consumed until at least a year after bottling.  Without aging, it has a harsh, musky aroma and an immature, almost characterless palate and is slightly harsh in the mouth as well. (A)

This beer holds a special place in my heart for me, as I enjoyed a glass of it the night I returned home from the hospital with my lovely wife and first, newborn son as a celebratory consumption. Its certainly a great beer for special occasions. (12% ABV)

Aged 1 year (2011 vintage): After a year of aging, the aroma is still a little musky and strong, but has begun to develop a hint of candy sweetness.  Its flavor suddenly seems mellow, and almost non-existent compared to a fresh bottle.  It seems way too mellow and, well, like its in one of those awkward, in-between stages.  Kinda like when you grow your hair out. (A/A+)

Aged 1 year (2010 vintage): Review pending.

Aged 2 years (2010 vintage): Aahh... now there we go.  At two years old (and three, in my opinion), the beer has reached its peak.  It has a strong, candy-like nose and flavors that will knock your socks off.  It tastes lightly candy-like and deliciously boozy.  Nice.  Not as empty in flavor and complexity as a one year old, and it has even started to impart a chocolate character.  This is so good it almost tastes like a dessert. (A++)

Aged 2 years (2009 vintage): Review pending.

Aged 3 years (2009 vintage): Not quite as great of a flavor as the 2-year old, and definitely more mellow.  Its aroma is almost candy-like, but smooth, and has a hint of perfume.  Its flavor is smooth, flavorful, and strong, but complex and its characteristics are well-infused with the alcohol.  Its superb in the mouth and very, very great.  Holy cow.  Its so sweet after three years and yet very well-balanced.

Plenty of wood in the aroma along with chocolate and some fruitiness. Wood jumps right out at you. Very peppery. Full bodied without being syrupy. Chocolate malt flavor that lingers long in the finish. A bit of alcohol, but thats not surprising for a 12% beer. There are some hops in there, but only enough to balance out the malt.

A- Pours a deep brownish-black hue with very little tan colored head.

Others have said they taste a lot of vanilla but I find that it is masked my the intense sweetness and burnt character.

M- Semi-thick, low on carbonation. It coats the mouth with a sticky sweetness that I dont necessarily enjoy.

I was interested to try this but ended up pretty disappointed, and it had nothing to do with having just tried the Dark Lord. Poured out a dark mahogany with little head. Right from the aroma I could tell this was just not going to be very good. It has that same damn wet paper/pen ink/nail polish/whatever you want to call it boozyness that is so prevalent in the World Wide Stout, which I absolutely hate. The flavour on this one is pretty pathetic, popsicle sticks with way too much sugar and toffee malt. Booze. Like a lame attempt at an Imperial Stout. A bit of melon as well. Yuk.

2676,"2009-04-13",2.9,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2009 Re-rate:  Bottle, this beer is aging terribly.  The funky wood notes have turned purfumey and dominate the pallate.  As the alcohol burn has subsided with age so have all of the crisp tight flavors of fruit and sugar.  Its just a sluggy aroma bomb of a 12% brown now.  

Original: Bottle, the aroma of this beer just keeps getting stronger with age.  The sour sweet wood fresh cut wood smell dominates the nose and just a hint of malty bread in the background.  This beer pours a rich brown that turns amber at the corners and a fluffy small off white head leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass.  The flavor is of cedar and sweet malts with a rush of simple syrup alcohol soak on the middle of the tongue.  I get meatly fruits like papaya and banana peel and a bit of berry tart and sweetness.  Blackberry mostly.  This thing is just a monster of sweet funky wood and wild fruit with lots of alcohol.

The beer is extremely smooth and malty like a scotch ale.  The dominating flavors are roasted malt, the ""palo santo"" wood, vanilla, and fruits I cannot identify.  The sip finishes with a warming alcohol, and is when the hops faintly emerge.

The lingering flavor of the wood mixed with alcohol is slightly annoying.  I cannot say that this is one of my favorite dogfish head beers.  Worth trying, but at your own risk.","Georgia, USA","hickey"
2676,"2009-04-11",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2014 updated commentary: aroma is medium to above-medium strength, of chocolate and dark fruit.  head retention very good.  if one is attentive one can detect the wood accent at the end of the sip/swallow, which adds to the flavor complexity (which already consists of said somewhat chocolatey and dark-fruity characteristics). feels rich and thick upon the first part of the sip, finishes smooth without any aggressive aftertaste.  Upped from 4.0 to 4.3 (an added point each for aroma, appearance, and overall)

Original comments (4/11/09) - There must be lots of fruit in that Palo Santo wood because this is fruitier than a mofo.  Got some kind of mixture of raspberry and strawberry to this.

2676,"2009-04-05",3.9,"Bottle. Pours an opaque, dark burgundy. Only the thinning edges allow light to pass through. The dark tan head isnt too abundant but very long lasting. There are lots of sweet aromas going on here, caramel, tons of molasses, dried and candied prunes and other darker fruits. Cacao is also evident. There are some less prevalent smoked, woody qualities as well. The mouthfeel is syrup-like with some very light carbonation. The initial flavour is of the candied and dried prunes and other darker citrus. The drier wood and smoke qualities quickly surface and overpower as the brew sits on the taste buds. Passing the tongue, the sweeter molasses and caramel and candied notes dissipate as smoke and wood attributes amplifies. Even amplified and overpowering the other flavours, however, the smoke and wood is actually quite mellow and well-rounded. The darker citrus remain, stripped from its dried and candied qualities of earlier. Cacao now becomes more apparent adding to the dryness of the flavour. Alcohol is quite evident as it creates a nice warming sensation in the chest and a bourbon-like flavour. The finish is lightly bitter and mildly dry with cacao, mild smoke, some wood, and dark fruits to round it off. Molasses, caramel, and the other sweeter notes hardly exist in the finish. Alcohol adds a nice kick to the finish and definitely to the senses! This is very enjoyable!","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

At $5.99 a bottle this was a reasonable price.  I am usually leery of Dogfish Heads big beers because they seem to mess something up.  However this was actually not bad.  Once again Dogfish Head has me confused.   Give it a shot if the price is right.

Aroma / Appearance - The dense foamy head suffocates the thick black body below.  Black cherry, anise, creamy vanilla, and banana make it a nice blend of flavors.  I dont know what palo santo smells like but whatever it is I like it.

Flavor / Palate - Warm and boozy the heaviness sticks to the throat and tongue.  Rick chocolate, banana, and licorice travel as a group between the throat.  It reminds me of a tropical interpretation of a stout.  Were the price more affordable I might give it a shot again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Theres molasses with a nice woody, bourbon taste and a pleasant alcohol burn. Theres chocolate and brown sugar on the finish.

Also tastes of caramel, roasted malt, and a fruit taste I am having a hard time placing.  A certain medicinal quality emerges half way through.  It develops an earthy, scotch like character as it warms.  Considering the alcohol content, the alcohol is reasonably well hidden.  The finish is a lingering boozy fruit with hints of wood.

The strong malt, coffee, chocolate and alcohol aromas are a knock out combination. Awesome bite and a creamy mouthfeel thats not at all overly sweet or syrupy thick.

Really enjoyable and close to a 10. The taste is not as good as the aroma, is still very nice. A fair amount of bitterness, but largely it is dominated by toasted malt and a little chocolate. Good mouthfeel, with a fairly long finish that seems to show more of the roasted malt character the longer it goes--almost a little ashy at times.

Vanilla, wood, and dense caramel aromas are very up front and nicely complex.  Light chocolate with alcohol spice that seems a slight bit gingerish.  Very light hints of roast.  The malt character is also lightly toasty and has a touch of freshly crushed malt.  A touch of solventy alcohol as it warms, but adds a bit of complexity along with some red wine fruitiness.  The palate is much the same as the aroma with deep caramel complexity and vanilla woody flavors most dominant.  Sweet up front, but semi sweet finish with a dry aftertaste that is from the alcohol.  Winey fruitiness, chocolate undertones and a light alcohol.  Some roasty notes add lighty to the complexity.  Mouthfeel starts out velvety, then dries out from the alcohol.

2676,"2009-01-23",4.6,"12oz bottle poured into an English pint.  DHPSM pours very deep brown with a medium-sized tan head.  This beer was recommended by my local liquor store beer guru but the price deterred me.  I finally picked up a 4-pack from Jungle Jims in Cincinnati.  This looked very much like a porter.  The aroma was unusually strong apricot along with alcohol and amber malts.  This was a very interesting beer with a lot of flavors to enjoy.  The flavors complimented each other well and neither blended into unanimity nor dominated.  The sweet apricot was the first thing I noticed due to aggressive flavor and uniqueness.    I have always believed that an alcohol flavor adds depth and character and this beer had just the right amount.  A bitter almond or high coco content chocolate flavor was the last thing I could reasonably identify before my mouth was overwhelmed by complexity and slightly numbed by alcohol.

Appearance: Opaque and black/brown. Almost no head and a slight lace of tan foam around the edge.

Nose: Soy, dark-roasted coffee beans, a whisper of smoke or heavy fresh cream. Smells almost stout-like.

Palate: Very little carbonation. Candy sugar is immediately noticeable, licorice, bitter coffee, umami (soy sauce), moss, herbal notes as if I was in an herb shop like lavender and dried teas. Theres also notes of cola and dried wheat stalks. A slight fruitiness is on the finish and fights with the coffee and soy and moist wood notes. I also think of this ""Alternative smoking blend"" that I bought at an herb store that may have contained mint, sagebrush and mugwort.

Notes: This beer is uber-complex on the palate, and it feels like its harmonious although somewhat random. All of the flavors are competing for center-stage, but its not disjointed.

2676,"2009-01-06",3.0,"20090105  12oz bottle from RB Spirits.  Dark brown beer with sticky tan head of loose tan foam.  Boozy aromas with clear DFH house character, there are subtle notes from the wood aging, though I could not pick palo santo wood from a thousand other woods, I am sure.  Lots of dark fruits, prune, molasses, and harbinger notes of burnt toast.  The beer is much more bitter than expected, clashing somewhat with what could be a mellowing woodiness.  Maybe it is the wood that gives the tannic bite.  Mostly a syrupy mess with potent alcohol present throughout.  Grapey, twiggy, sweet, bitter, cloying, and astringent.  Weird, and weirdly loved, this one has not done it for me after a few tries.  While I can appreciate their cavalier attitude toward experimentation with the unique and historic, it would be great to see DFH get back to a focus on their hoppy brews and barley wine type stuff, and away from this kitsch.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

2676,"2008-12-21",3.7,"Im always glad to see a new Dogfish Head beer on the shelf. They usually dont disappoint, and the Palo Santo is no exception.  To all appearances it is an unexceptional beer, an opaque brown with a reasonably normal tan head.  But the color belies a uniquely prepared beer, aged on a Paraguayan wood, whose name was generously shared with the beer.  As far as the aroma goes, the wood aging provides a hearty bouquet of wood, fig and chocolate covered raisins.  Its definitely a sweet smell, with the wood taking on less of an oak barrel quality and more of a cut and prepped timber dryness.  The carbonation is unremarkable, but the flavor is exceptional.  A fig flavor quickly works its way around the palate, aided by the adhesive tendencies of some licorice flavors.  All-spice and brown sugar offer a sweeter side to the taste, helping somewhat to balance the woody dryness.  A decent alcohol bite, an echoed aftertaste and a great flavor from start to finish, the Palo Santo is another success from the brewers at Dogfish Head.  On a side note, Id really love to know more about the brewing process for this beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Looks thick and viscous with a head that consists of a quick fizz of tan carbonation that is gone immediately.  Smell is alcohol, tar, wood, molasses, and syrup.  The taste is powerful malts, some caramel and toastiness, then a beautifully integrated alcohol presence, thick smoky notes almost whiskey like and the some peat like a nice scotch.

2676,"2008-12-08",2.0,"Poured thick, black with no head.  I was very surprised at the consistency of this beer.  The aroma is definately malty.  When I tried it, I thought there was a very distinct maltiness to it, with no hops and there is a fairly strong medicinal overtone that I get that is unpleasant.  There are some hints of wood, that come through as smokey or ashtray at times.  Not a beer that I would drink again.","Columbia, Pennsylvania, USA","machfive55"
2676,"2008-12-07",3.6,"Praise God!! Dogfish is now available in California. Pours a dark tan head. Held up to a light bulb no light shows through the glass. Definately a strong ale/barley wine-esque variety. Aroma is definately on the malty side, but perhaps I am smelling a bit of effect of the wood.. Definately has a woody flavor in the beer. Sort of like a burbon barrell stout without the bourbon overtones. Body is very thick, which does not surprise me since it has 12% alc. Hop character is there toning down the sweetness of the malt, but, as with the aroma, this beer definately leans to the malt side of the spectrum. Very warming on the back of the throat. Warmth lingers on the pallate even a couple of minutes after drinking it. A bit on the expensive side. $15/4pack at BevMo, but am happy to see anything from Dogifish finally make it to Cali. Think aging this would help quite a bit.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

Not much lace.  Dark brown sugar and a strange raspberry robitussin menagerie on the nose.  I am kinda glad I only got one bottle at this point.  Flavor starts with a dutch cocoa bitterness.  Initially similar to Indian Brown.  Then that crazy raspberry cough syrup duo shows up again.  I am assuming this is the Palo Santo wood.  I do not think it agrees with my palate much.

It pours to a deep dark brownish black with quite a bit of vanilla on the nose.  In fact, I pretty much just get vanilla, albeit in different permutations (Carmel, Bean, etc.). Disclaimer: I love vanilla. 
On the palate it’s a rich consistency and, surprise, finishes with a malty vanilla-ness.

Flavor packs a wallop, but is a simply magnificent blend of roasts, wood, darker malts, and a touch of dried fruit.  Mid-palate and finish showcase more of the woody, roasted, even chocolate flavors which are attractive.  The body in this beer is excellent, a full-bodied mouthfeel with a perfectly extended finishing note.  Yes, there is alcohol.  But I really cant agree that it overpowers the other flavors present.

If I have one complaint  and this may be dismissed as a personal bias  it is that Dogfish may have overdone the sweetness of this brew.  But overall, this should rank high on the growing list of big American beers.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

2676,"2008-10-07",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2014 My Bottom Line:
The sweetness of licorice, hazelnuts and earthy figs is intelligently offset by amiable woody spiciness and smoke in this most creative and elegant sipper of a strong ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A film of foam floats atop the blackened dark brown.
-The prickly carbonation enlivens the heavy, nourishing body.
-Alcohol is not too present in the flavor profile, as is customary with DFH high gravity ales.
-A wooden dryness is felt in the finish, with a few peppery angles.
-A link with the Imperial Stout family is hard to miss; I find this to be a compelling twist on this highly popular style.

Head is large, frothy, light brown with fair lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is dark brown.

The nose is heavy of molasses and plum, moderate of brown sugar.  The taste is heavy and rich, filling tongue, mouth, and throat.  The initial drink is of malt and of wood.  The wood flavor is not smoky per se, but it dawdles like a smoky wood.  The finish is a good alcohol finish that lingers and lingers and lingers.

Everything about this ale is heavy, except for its ""handedness,"" for this is excellent stuff.  As it warms, the already rich and complex flavor intensifies and increases in complexity.

The aroma reminds me of cedar, crushed mint, and mahogany chips, with the deep roast malt pushed way into the background;  and oddly, I think there’s a hint of green olive saltiness.  The taste - oh, that’s yummy - halfway between an oily/nutty brown ale and an imperial stout - coffee ground acidity, oak-resin, table cream, herbal and quite strong alcohol - I love it.  Surprisingly only average-at-best bodied, but solid carbonation and acidity, a long oily, malty, boozy finish to it - I got the wood-aging more in the finish, but I suspect the palo santo wood character is what makes this so mellow, for a 12% heavily roasted beer.

The aroma featured that trademark sweet, malty & yeasty nose, with a few touches of brown sugar, chocolate, raisins & bread.  The beer poured an opaque & very dark brown color.  It was almost black.  The head featured a hue of dark tan & left some nice lacing around the glass.  The body was quite heavy & even a little syrupy.  The flavors were both sweet & savory, with notes of dark chocolate, sweet & bready malts, a hint of alcohol, dark roasted coffee, some bitter hoppiness & a touch of oak.  This is definitely one complex beer.  I was very disappointed a few weekends ago when I visited the brewpub in Rehoboth.  I ordered one, but it never arrived.  I learned later that they had just run out of it.  But then I stumbled across it at my local distributor.  I paid $72 for the case, but it is well worth it.

Holy crap, this stuff is darker than I first thought- pours like motor oil as the aroma fills the room. Dark, solid black with a thin head- one of the darkest brown heads Ive yet seen on a beer. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass that dissipates over time. First smell, so many different notes that I have to take multiple sniffs. Aroma is of roasted coffee, vanilla beans, ginger, lots of wood, nuts. With a scent like this I cant wait to taste it. First sip... very malty, a bit sour, lots of brown ale taste and some toastiness of a porter in there as well. Sweet notes, and a lot of spicy ground pepper feel on the finish that leaves the mouth a bit tingly. This is a fantastic experience. Going in depth with the flavors... Lots of sweet ginger, toasted woody malt, roasted coffee, chocolate, some hop bitterness there as well as I get acquainted with this beer... Fruit notes- plum, raisin, other dark fruits that I cant quite put my finger on. There is so much to talk about, this is by far the most complex beer Ive ever had. The kicker for me is the spicy finish along with the severe alcohol warming effect without any semblence of an alcohol bite whatsoever even at 13% ABV. This is a superb, perfectly made beer. I have yet to try one better and it will probably be some time until I will. This beer is as close to perfect as Ive ever tasted. I cant gush enough about this beer.","Lincoln Park, New Jersey, USA","Underhook"

Appearance and aroma are same as before. But am I imagining things or has the flavor really kicked it up a notch after five months. The wood is definitely still there, but it no longer seems to completely dominate the flavor profile. Now a strong core of blackcurrant jam flavors comes through very prominently. Very good. I still see banana and vanilla and licorice. Im excited now to see how the last two bottles turn out.

The nose, however, didn’t impress me one bit... strong, sweet and malty as expected, it’s drowned in dust and alcohol, invoking a tiny gag reflex for me. The taste, however, fixed the impression again. A fine woody, very roasty and sweet maltiness. The alcohol is buried in there and not nearly as prominent as it was in the nose. Warming though. Light notes of bubblegum, touch of chocolatey vanilla and coffee.  Sticky.  Some liight acidic hop. Very complex indeed and a fine beer.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"

2676,"2008-09-07",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2012 Poured from the bottle into a trappist glass, I immediately realized this beer was special.  A subtle fruit aroma with some raisins and figs, and a bit of roasty coffee, chocolate, and vanilla malt scents, with a hearty wood effect.  Very black in color with a dark brown hue and a thicker, syrupy pour and dense consistency.  A very faint dark tan head that had minimal retention and hardly any cling, but some lacing.  Superb flavor, featuring darker fruity sweetness and raisin, but also the presence of the chocolate, coffee, and touches of vanilla, earthy hops, and a wood effect.  Full and dense mouthfeel, with alot of cling on the palate, slow going down with hardly any carbonation, and a syrupy, thinner body that was pretty dry.  Good for taking small sips, and the high alcohol content is wonderfully controlled.  Definitely a top notch ale!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

Alcohol is entirely hidden in the nose.  Flavors of dry dark roasted malt, with some vanilla sweetness and smoke in the background.  Alcohol is surprisingly hidden at 12% and the thing is incredibly drinkable.  Comes across much like an amped-up or sweetened-up dry stout.

Hops are very present despite the strong malt backbone at 12%; though the alcohol is really kept in check.  Thick mouthfeel and a medium-long finish.

Wow, Dogfish Head Palto Santo Marron looks super thick on the pour and is dark reddish brown (looks like the color of liquid dark chocolate).  No head or crown forms on the surface during or afte the pour.  The aroma is strong and fairly complex.  It is moderately sweet and has notes of deeply caramelized malt, chocolate, vanilla (egg-style), smoke/char, and so waming alcohol.  The flavor is strong and intesnse as well.  Lots of extremely caramelized malt is punctuated by high cacao content chocolate with custard flair and a dry edge to it.  The beer is nicely balanced between a moderately sweet maltiness and a dry, more bitter finish.  It reminds me of eating 60%-80% cacao chocolate as the sweet-bitter plays out on the palate with some additional twists thrown in.  This beer is strong, but the alcohol actually works well with the deep flavors.  As suspected, this beer is very thick, mildly sticky, mellow, and a joy on the palate.  This is a great sipping beer and well-worth the price.  Does it live up to the hype?

Smell is delicious, big roast malts, hints of nuttiness, coffee, chocolate as well, dark fruits, cedar-like wood, slight tinge of sugary bubblegum, light booze.

Palate is full-bodied, dense and chewy malt texture, moderate carbonation. Overall, this is one tough brown ale at 12%, the specialty wood does a good job of accenting and not dominating the flavor profile, the stiff alcohol presence puts this in the range between traditional strong ale and ""sipping"" dessert beers, a nice treat for brown ale fans.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

This beer is like their normal brown ale on alcoholic steroids. It pours a deep and dark brown with a very small, dark, and bubbly chocolate tan head that dissipates very quickly probably due to the high alcohol content. No real lacing left over. Relatively strong aroma, brown ale/caramel maltiness, with a kick of alcohol and roasty vanilla as well as roasted chocolate. I dont know what palo santo wood smells like, but this sure smells like it was aged in some kind of wood barrell. Im not too big on wine, but Im getting some sort of wine smell to this too. I really like this intense brown ale flavor. It has a hint of alcohol, but the roasted chocolate and vanilla is great. A very warm flavor and finish. Rich and woody with a very full and creamy mouthful. It does have that imperial stout style to the finish. Overall, this beer is awesome. Another great beer from dogfish head.

I had heard much rumblings and murmurs about new wood barrels at the Dogfish Head brewery and new beers that were being berthed in their depths. It is with great anticipation and salivation that I pop open my Palo Santo Marron bottle and pour her deep brown-black liquid bread into my glass.

Wow. Deep brown-black she is, and with a nice tight cappuccino hued head on top which fades into a similarly colored ring around my glass. I get rich earthy, woody, aromas in the nose. a delicate array of vanilla, a hint of sweet caramel, and a bit of a crisp citrus zing hiding in the background. Overall, a woody aroma, almost reminiscent of a finely aged single-malt scotch or sipping rum. I take a quaff. Thick, viscous, lusciously earthy with tons of vanilla, wood, and caramel. A clean body for being such a heavy beer, leaving a light hoppy citrus zing in my mouth while the alcohol warms my throat and body. creamy. Sweet. Woody. Even more hints of vanilla and caramel, maybe a wee bit of licorice peeking through. Such a complex beer and yet so easy to drink. As Palo Santo warms, opening up more of herself to me, even more alcohol sweetness rises in the nose, almost reminding me of a finely aged scotch. A smooth blend in the body, she coats my palate more as the initial lingering hop zing fades and more wood-aged dark malty brown ale character shows. 

Its amazing what a little bit of wood aging can do for a beer. Luscious. Complex. Woody vanilla notes. Palo Santo Marron will age well, and I am definitely looking forward to how she will taste a year or two from now.

Body is surprisingly lifted with vanilla, caramel, slightest notion of coffee and loads of wood.  Very, very soft but the creamy mouthfeel lets them get away with it.

I’m impressed again at their ingenuity in crafting another beer that blends styles and offers a new experience for the palate.

Big aroma, a blend of rich chocolate with a vinous character, a hint of dark fruits, and some alcohol.  Enticing, I sniffed at this for a long time before even taking the first sip.  Flavor is initially vinous, followed by a solid note of vanilla that moves into chocolate flavors.  Hint of dried plum on the finish.  Warming alcohol, but not at all hot.

Flavors are warm and wintery with hues of chocolate, toffee, vanilla, molasses, soy sauce, and rain-soaked firewood. An almost cloying mouthfeel; an enveloping texture that smooths out in future sips. Slightly astringent and sticky on the lips.

2676,"2008-07-15",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2008 Truly exquisite aroma, similar to the Midas Touch in a lot of ways. Very strong espresso smell, not coffee per se, but the sweet foamy espresso with cream aroma. Also touches of vanilla, oak, banana (odd), wood, nuttiness, and chocolate. I wasnt expecting the beer to pour this dark; it has the look and consistency of motor oil. The head is also not thick at all, and not very stable either, something unique for a beer this dark. Extremely alcoholic, acrid first sip, with a dominating sour woodiness. Roasty and meaty are probably accurate descriptives, but I think its a bit over the top. The Palo Santo wood barrels add a lot to the aroma, but the flavor is overkill and extremely astringent. Other flavors present in the brew are a mild pepperiness, likely from the wood aging;
banana; a hint of orange or sweet lemon; and abundant dark roast coffee. A little grapey and winey at the bottom, with an interesting sandalwood-like flavor profile. A valiant attempt at originality, Dogfish, but you went a little too far this time, IMHO.","San Francisco, California, USA","DubC5000"

Nose of dark fruit- most notably plum and raisin with some sweet chocolate coming through as well. Flavor was malt heavy- lost of roasted barley, toasted oatmeal, with caramel and some earthy, woody aspects to it as well.

How: Bottle.  Sample at Mondial de la Bière 2008
The look: Black body topped by small tan ring of foam
In long: Strong nose of alcohol, raisin pie and wood.  Taste is wood/barrel upfront.  Thankfully this is not yet another bourbon barrel character, this one has a pleasant old wooden chest feeling (if that makes any sense to you).  Opening the drawers of my old wooden chest I found flavours of highly roasted nuts, fudge, raisins, grapes and molasses.  Sweet but not overly so, the medium-high roastiness level helps to hide the sweetness and create a dryness sensation.

2676,"2008-07-02",3.9,"12 oz bottle courtesy of bvc.  Bottled on date of 04/16/08.  Pour is black with some faint ruby highlights, with a three inch tan head which settles nicely.  A bunc of big carbonation bubbles lead to a very fluffy head that leaves behind gorgeous lacing.  Aroma is roasty maltiness, wood, and slightly sweet almost vanilla cherry element to it.  Interesting nose, all nicely blended together.    Taste reveals quite a bit more of the woodiness from the nose.  The vanilla and roastiness are present as well, though the wood is really the dominant flavor.  As the beer warms, the vanilla sweetness again shows some cherry.  Alcohol is present with its warmth, though it very much tastes a part of the overall flavor, rather than apart from the overall flavor.  For a 12% beer, the alcohol is actually remarkably subdued, particularly for how young this bottle is.  Some licorice is evident in the after taste.  Palate is medium to full.  Decently mouth coating.  Very drying finish.  Overall, a very interesting, well constructed beer.  Thanks for sending this one my way, Brandon.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

I wouldn’t have pegged it at over 7 had I not known ahead of time. there’s this great maple syrup in the aroma and flavor that melds nicely with the wood, which comes off as a cross between cedar and oak.

2676,"2008-06-29",4.0,"12oz bottle, Bottled on 04/15/08, courtesy of heemer77, thanks a lot Eric!  At least, I think thats the date--the print was a bit smudged.  It took me looking through 65 ratings before I found another RBian that had the same dated bottle.  Be more specific, you lazies!  Pours a thick deep ruby with a one finger brown head, pretty good retention.  Lots of sweet toasted malts, brown sugar, vanilla notes, and some cola.  Fig, earth, wood, and some roast and chocolate are also present.  Complex!  Flavor still has some chocolate and toasted malts, and adds some smoke and dry peppery wood in the finish with some alcohol--though I wouldnt put this at 12%.  Burps cola.  Full body with low carbonation.  This turned out pretty damn good.

The head is thin but dense, and mocha brown - Im really surprised by how dark this one is. Aroma has notes of roasted coffee, cacao, smokey wood, vanilla, a bit of maple and molasses-dark malts. Coffee really comes through in the flavor, as well as the wood. Theres a sweetness that reminds me of burned marshmallows. Not toasted - burned. Torched. Theres a definite bitter presence, too, and just enough carbonation to keep it clean. At times I really feel like I have a block of wood in my mouth.

This is an awesome, truly ""dark"" beer, rich with old hops and thick syrupy malt, and a truly unique wood flavor I have not seen in anything else.

Drier than I expected, though still sweet, and the wood adds an interesting quality to the beer, complimenting the dryness... Having said that, its a solid tasty strong American brown.

Its reminiscent of the Indian Brown Ale.  Appearance is more like an Imp. Stout.  It is more black than brown, and has a thin tan head.  Very attractive. The flavor is fruity and sweet, piney hops, chocolate, with the flavor of the wood coming through.  Licorice, molasses as well.  As it heads to the finish, I notice real piney hop bittering, some candy sweetness and alcohol.  The alcohol provides a warming and pleasant finish.  Beuatiful beer all the way around.  Great effort by Dogfish Head to create something truly unique.  Also, at $15.99 for 4 beers, this was an expensive beer adventure.  Definitely worth it though.

2676,"2008-06-15",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2013 Pours almost opaque black into the glass, with the deepest of mahogany hues. A tan cap closes to a thin ring that diminishes to nothing down the bottle. Deep, dark nose with Candi Sugar, very malty, (baking-) flavor extracts, and a touch of vinous notes. This is very malty, beginning quite sweet, almost airy, with drying dark fruits and roasted malts. There develops a hint of sours/dough in the mid-palate. The finish brings forth earthy roasted-wood remnants, a shade drier, with hints of the ABV, although extremely well ""held-in-check"" (enhancing the drinkability). All of these aspects come together during a long-lasting effervescence at the end of the pull. The mouthfeel offers more complex contrasts, with a light syrup/oily palate meeting both a nice livening zest of carbonation levels and integrated ABV warmth. Overall, a heavier brew that succeeds as good quaff, and only gets better as it approaches room temperature. I canât wait for a year or two to age my other bottle and see the nice changes I encounter. Very well done.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

The flavor focused on molasses, tar, and vanilla for sweetness with toasted wood accenting.. sweet finish with dark, syrupy sugars masking the alcohol completely.

Weird beast with a strong barrel character that seemingly takes more room than actual malt.

Slight roasty bitterness and alcohol burn in the finish.  Alcohol is incredibly well hidden.  This is an incredible beer and sets a new standard for American Browns.  Great choice for a beer to showcase the palo santo.  Looking forward to future brews that come out of the palo santo barrel they are currently building.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

2676,"2008-05-13",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2008 Batch 1. Borderline-opaque bronze. Thick collar of beige froth surrounds a scattered center. Seductively complex notes of nougat, tobacco, port wine, nutty malt, vanilla, butter toffee and cocoa invade the olfactory senses. Hint of cherries, juniper, medicine and zingy yet remarkably well-cloaked alcohol. Softly carbonated, but fairly fuzzy on the palate. Initially airy yet supple, rich and malty with an extravagant undertow of bright, soft, resinous wood which seamlessly melds with the lush, hearty, and deeply layered toffee-drenched malt core. Tannins are entirely nonexistent.   Black malt poignantly bristles as it contributes a hint of burnt cookies and creamed java to the bouncy, pillow-soft malt base which beautifully offsets the brisk, lightly metallic char bite. Clean alcohol is felt in the gullet and perfectly tempers the sweetness, but never tarnishes the array of subtleties. Firm black malt acidity echoes the tangy raisin, cherry and prunelike fruitiness while clingy dabs of port wine and molasses continue with a weightier pull to support the sharper, more-defined malt (Crystal?)  tones. Finishes with an artful balance of bright wood, succulent tobacco, tingly char and a faint plum and cherry fruitiness which lingers. I pretty much lost hope for this brewery as it seems its been a number of years since theyve produced a great batch of beer.  Ive gotta say that this beer has rekindled my excitement.   Intricately layered malt mammoths such as this are always a treat. Absolutely well done!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2676,"2008-05-13",4.0,"Pours an extremely dark brown.  Aroma is vanilla, with caramel, toffee, dark fruits, wood.  Flavor is full of vanilla, fruits, toasted malts, with a touch of chocolate.  The beer is shockingly easy to drink for it having 12%.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
2676,"2008-05-13",4.0,"Pours a dark mahogany brown color.  A translucent cola color shows at the edges.  The frothy, light brown head settles to a thin, fizzy layer, leaving sticky ribbons of lacing on the glass.  The aroma shows a complex blend of dark chocolate, molasses, indiscernible dark fruits, scorched wood, and vanilla.  The woody note is similar to beechwood on the nose.  There is a faintly tannic feel to the fruit component, balanced by a touch of overly-ripe banana sweetness.  Flavors are equally complex, ranging from imperial porter-like chocolate roastiness to Belgian strong ale fruits and spices.  The vanilla component is huge, with the distinct wood imparting darkly charred, funky vinousness.  A medium-full, slick body is finely carbonated.  Deceptively easy to drink at 12%.  Finishes long and roasty, with lingering tannins.  A truely unique and finely tuned brew.  This one defies conventional categorization, and defies it well.  Great beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2676,"2008-05-13",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2009 Pours a very dark brown color with a light brown, pillowy, fairly small head; it settles to a very small layer and leaves a bit of lace.  Nose is nice but somewhat unpronounced for the ABV; vanilla bean is prominant with faint notes of caramel, burnt wood, hazelnut, roasted malts, and an obscure fruit note.  Flavor is better with vanilla bean dominating still but with also: maple, charred wood, roasted hazelnut, semisweet chocolate, faint raisin, and some caramel nougat.  It is quite sweet but has a moderately light, earthy bitterness to it.  Palate is full, chewy, slightly syrupy, nearly lively and slightly warming.  Finishes with an almost cotton candy sweetness from the vanilla and the caramel nougat notes; it also remains on the tongue for quite a while with some mildly dry semisweet chocolate and hazelnut notes.  I really wanted to like this one with the creative wood aging and the imperial brown ale base, but the sweet vanilla notes became almost cloying at times.  The Palo Santo wood does add an intriguing new quality to the beer, but I feel it might be better suited for an imperial porter or stout given the high vanilla character and the charred notes could be more balanced by more roasty or bitter notes.  Or even the Palo Santo wood could be used with some other wood to age it?  Nevertheless, I have to give DFH credit for trying something inventive and pushing the boudaries again.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Huge, room-filling aroma, syrupy sticky molasses and campfire smoke with a huge, huge cash of wood (not oak or cedar or anything recognizable, but very pungent and attractive).  A little cream, vanilla, and chocolate.  Some firm Scotch ale accents and a ton of alcohol.  Currants and dark cherries.  Dark brown pour is essentially pitch with a dark brown, creamy head tinged with red.  Very dry, lightly bitter taste that gains a bit of sweetness in the mid-body; not at all cloying (like most of the big DFH releases)!  Molasses and brown sugar, chocolate with touches of vanilla and alcohol fumes (though I wouldnt have guessed 12%).  Creamy full body and a dry, woody aftertaste, very malty with faint whisps of peat and smoke.  Touch of earth, touch of grape, and even more plum.  Also has some Dubbel character.

The mouthfeel is thinner than a stout would be.  The flavor is big and hearty with a malty impact.  Some traces of black licorice and dried fruit are present.

To me theres not a terrific amount of the wood in the nose; and whats there isnt especially distinct. I must confess that I was disappointed by the flavor too.

2676,"2008-04-24",4.1,"12 oz. bottle in trade with Snojerk321- thanks!  Poured into trappist glass- thick black body, non transparent when held to a light source, low carbonation, thin off white ring for a head.  Aroma of dark chocolate, wood, and 3 day old coffee that has been sitting- but in a good way.  HIts the mouth with a defined medium body, alot of the dark malt comes through cleanly, a note of hardwood which is shockingly good, finish has a subtle burn to it.

With a unique woody character consuming every aspect of this beer, it is easy to close your eyes and believe you are in a hardware store! Looking beyond the wood, this ale is full of other interesting characteristics. The taste is full of deep brown roasted malts, and the color is a pitch black with smaller  deep caramel head. Hints of caramel and vanilla add complexity and balance to a true beer drinking experience.

2676,"2008-04-13",3.9,"Ill have to re-rate this after the few Im going to cellar have had a few months to a year to mellow.  Good beer though. Very interesting as you can imagine from reading the description.  Im not sure how the special wood is much different from oaking a beer, but whatever wood is used, it can bump up the flavor profile of a beer considerably.  The aroma of this one is a leathery, earthy musk, with a hint of sweet dried fruit.  It reminded me of going into a boot shop with the leather kick.  I consumed this one at or just below cellar temperature, and the flavors were fairly strong.  Seems fairly tannic, from the winey note that the wood gives this beer.  Finishes with a sweet raisin and alcohol kick.  As with any oaked (or whatever kind of wood this was) beer, cellaring will give it time to mature, and the flavors to meld even more.","Maryville, Tennessee, USA","dolemite77"
2676,"2008-04-13",4.1,"This interesting, handcrafted brown ales full-bodied maltiness carries earthy herbal and oak notes that roll slowly across the back of the tongue.  Its velvety, molasses-sweet character enlivens the palate after several sips, and a mapley, licorice/vanilla pod presence lingers in the mouth and throat. Hints of medium coffee and light bitterness intensify as the murky dark brown liquid warms while toasty, fruit (banana bread) tones add nuance to the overall mouthfeel.  Excellenty crafted, Palo Santo finishes with a luscious, supersweet aroma that evolves into an appetizing cocoa/caramel goodness.

I also detect some light spice and earthy yeast character. The finish is moderately woody and ashy malt. The mouth feel is shockingly smooth compared to many of the DFH new releases lately, only a light amount of alcohol and warming. Oily and soft palate works well with the flavor profile.

Long, bittersweet chocolate finish, with some alcohol sticking around warming the palate. Great with dessert.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
2676,"2008-04-02",3.8,"12 oz bottle, thanks to wetherel. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with some orange at the extremities and a tight tan head.

The flavor is rich and tannic at first sip. Very malty, lots of chocolate, licorice, vanilla, and raisin notes. Theres a definite wooden tone to the finish. I dont know what I should expect from palo santo wood, but the flavor reminds me of cedar or juniper, except far more rounded. Lots of vanilla in the aftertaste, with just a hint of nuts. Once in a while I pick up a chewy, yeasty note. The alcohol is very well masked, especially for 12%. Mouthfeel is on the viscous side. I could drink a lot of this... dangerous stuff.

2676,"2008-03-30",3.6,"Another of the unusual formulations to come out of Dogfish Head, Palo Santo Marron poured out closest in looks to a Porter.  The body was dark brown coming out of the bottle, but in the glass, it looked pretty black.  The head was quite large and settled down to a three plus finger layer of craggy foam.  The smell was quite nondescript for a beer with such a complex origin.  All I could smell was a little toffee, chocolate, and chicory.  The taste was much more typical of wood barrel aged beers than the smell.  I got a dash of vanilla, some sweet gummy flavors, a little chocolate, and a sour finish.  I was somewhat disappointed that the alcohol was not hidden at all.  I think this has some rough edges still which beg to be smoothed out by more aging.  The mouthfeel was creamy and oily and the body was a little thicker than I was anticipating.  Not a bad foray into wood aged beers, but more time is needed to mellow this baby out.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

I know that they call this a brown ale, but I dont think that it can be put into a specific style(brown ale, imperial porter, stout,???) Aroma of sweet caramel malt, coffee, vanilla, and dark fruit(almost like a Belgian influence). Flavor is vanilla dominant, with tastes of coffee, molasses, and dark fruit. The wood is definitely having an effect on things. This is a truly unique beer, but at 12%, and overly malty sweet, consumption will be very limited.","Centerville, Ohio, USA","clingman71"

2676,"2008-03-25",4.0,"12oz bottle. Pours a very dark, opaque brown (almost black) - like espresso. The head is brown, thin, and short-lived (though it leaves lace on the glass). The head blossoms into a full foam after swirling the beer in the snifter, releasing the aromas as well as the dissolved carbon dioxide. The aroma is strong and very dessert-liquer-like: alcohol, fruit (banana, plum), malts, and subtle notes of roasted grain (dark chocolate). Swirling to release the aromas causes slightly acetic notes to come forth. The flavor starts strong with alcohol and strong with dark grains - dark chocolate and coffee. There are some vinous qualities to the strong, fruity malts that the front of the palate encounters. The middle of the tongue finds more residual sweetness and flavors of chocolate-covered caramels - but more decadent thanks to the complex esters and high level of alcohol. The finish is full with lots of roast and sweetness and warming. The mouthfeel is unexpectedly bubbly - almost stinging from the combo of high alcohol and high carbonation. Swirling in the glass releases more carbon dioxide until the beer has a nice, creamy, more subtly carbonated texture. Overall, a decadent and delicious brew. It tasted more Baltic Porter-ish than strong brown ale-ish - though 12% is way higher a typical Baltic Porter...","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

2676,"2008-03-23",3.3,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 2/11/08) and served in a snifter.  This beer poured a glossy black/dark brown with a thin head of tan foam that slightly lasted throughout the glass.  A decent amount of slippery lacing was left behind.  The aroma of the beer was made up of molasses, charred wood, dark fruits, mild chocolate, and some earthy yeast esthers.  The flavor included chocolate, caramel, wet wood, and charred malt.  The mouthfeel was slick and full-bodied with mild carbonation.  A decent beer, but kind of tame by Dogfish Heads standards of risk taking.  The beer had a nice roasty flavor, but wasnt all that interesting.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Different but enjoyable.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"

2676,"2008-03-22",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2008 Dark brown pour, medium brown head. Aroma is woody.

2676,"2008-03-22",4.3,"12 oz bottle from South Bay Drugs. This poured as a very dark and black stout color with a fizzed layer of heading. The initial nose was hard to determine what exactly made it smell so good since there was so much going on in my memory of scents. Basically, I can find a medium roasted malt and perhaps vanilla with an underlining presence of the wood used to age this ale. The flavor is robust and difficult to pin point what are the strong characteristics that stand out but it did hold a sweet molasses syrup and caramel malt with a very minor roasted flavor and a brief reminder of the wood again. Certainly an interesting ale? Stout? Malt liquor?","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

The flavor is of roasted malt, vanilla, oak, and some mild dark fruit notes.  Its sweet and full bodied with the ABV that provides a warming finish to this excellent sipper.

2676,"2008-03-22",4.5,"Wow. Pour is nothing short of perfect. Nice, tight and light khaki head. Beer is black. No light escapes the snifter, negating the claim of a ""brown ale"". Not that theres anything wrong with that. When you use chocolate and black malts, expect this. Nose of sour and wood (equally), as well as black patent malt notes of cofee and roast. Some mollases in there as well. Balanced and light.  Flavor is more of the same with a surprisingly medium body; expecting the fuller body for the alcohol level, but realizing that the dry finish is a result of the yeast having their way, resulting in a very complex beer. Almost a chili pepper finish. Wow. A fluke Im sure the brewery didnt expect. Different and welcome. A lighter bodied and more drinkable high gravity beer is a nice surprise when stacked up to so many thick, syrupy dark beers these days. Not that I dont love them, but this beer has the complexity, medium body and reputation of the brewery to back up my rating. Should age beautifully.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"
2676,"2008-03-21",4.0,"Huh?  Not an imperial stout?!?  Looks like one, smells like one, tastes more like a foreign stout, but close enough!  Oh well!  Pours a very dark brown with a healthy light tan head.  The nose is sweet and roasty ala imperial stout, but I notice a strong hint of fruit upon further inspection.  A hint of cinnamony chocolate to boot.  Light licorice laced alcohol.  The mouthfeel is on par with imperial stouts.  Full rich and creamy, with relatively subdued carbonation.  The flavor is strongly imperial stout, particularly as it warms up.  Sweet chocoate over raisins, a good dose of coffee.  A bit of alcohol, to but that rich creamy sweetness.  But the finish is much more tannic, sharp, acidic.  Light on the tongue in flavor.  Figgy alcohol really, especially in the drier than expected finish.  Rather enjoyable.  The wood seems subtle.  I wonder how this will age... I hope to find out!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
2676,"2008-03-20",3.8,"12oz bottle.
Pours an opaque dark brown with an effervescent, bubbly tan head that gradually disappears. Aroma reveals light roasted coffee and grains, a bit of toffee and some raisin. Flavor starts with an intense burst of dry, roasted grain and some wood notes, though Id never know this was wood-aged if I hadnt read the label -- tastes like a straight-up coffee porter. Some malt sweetness and dried fruit comes on later, followed by a slight numbing of the mouth and gums from the alcohol. Palate is thick and a bit grainy/chalky. Interesting stuff indeed.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

2676,"2008-03-19",3.3,"Pours an impenetrably dark brown body with a dinkus tan head that quickly reduces to a slender ring around the glass.  No lace.  The aroma is dark roasty malts, old caramel, charred wood (Is it really palo santo?), and cold coffee.  Mayhaps some bittersweet chocolate and dried fruit are added to the flavor.  Mayhaps not.  The strong ABV never rears its head during the drinking.  Its not bad, but Im underwhelmed, given DFHs attempt at hype on this one.  Nothing special contributed by the ""exotic"" wood.  Nothing really special at all.  Just a solid, somewhat murky strong Brown Ale (the notes didnt indicate how DFH had achieved a 12% ABV) with a dark wood addition.  Maybe, as the inevitable <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/ViewUser.asp?UserID=1 had voiced, a little aging would help.  Maybe not.

Loved the thought process behind creating a unique brew using raw wooden barrels but their impact on the flavor was minimal at best.  I just didnt get the overwhelming ""woodsy"" flavor or aroma.

Ill tell you what though, Ive had 6% beers that burn more than this one going down. DFH calls this one a brown ale, RB says its an ASA and it reminds me of a stout.

2676,"2008-03-15",4.0,"Bottle. Pours rather thick and a very deep brown.  The head is small and dark tan with cascades rolling beneath it from a tilt or swirl. For some reason I was really expecting a lighter bodied brew. I guess I dont know DFH well enough. The aroma is very nice and malty. Suggestions of tobacco, earth, nuts, and a deep woodiness are present. I wouldnt know this actually included wood unless I read it on the label, but it definitely makes sense. The flavor is heavy and malty, kind of meaty even. A soft, caramelized sweetness hits the palate first. Then the brew transitions to complex wooden tones before culminating in a earthy, meaty, almost smoky finish. Drinking this beer makes me think it would pair excellently with a cigar. A few sips brings out faint hints at ripe fruits, but this is still all about the arbor character. 12 % abv is hidden exceptionally well. There are quite a few crazy brews DFH puts out that I just dont care for. This is one of the others that makes me keep trying them anyway.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Smell: Rich, blended aroma of cocoa powder, smokey wood, molasses, black currants, and a beefy Argentina red wine.

Taste: Intense, chewy maltiness with flavors of with chocolate, molasses, and light coffee all with a medium sweetness. Black currant jam fruitiness. Subtle, earthy wood component. The palo santo adds to the complexity of the brew, sure, but doesnt really bash you in the head with wood. Hints of vanilla, green peppercorns, and red wine. Light touch of acidity. Rather restrained hop bitterness. Finishes semi-sweet with a touch of spice.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Very enjoyable. The 12% is quite well hidden within this fine beer. The palo santo wood really brings a little some extra to the beer, like when they give you extra peanuts on a flight.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Flavor is very much dopplebock-like.   Soy sauce is the predominant character.  Kind of reminds me of Sam Adams Triple Bock, although not nearly as strong or putrid as that stuff. This is the kind of beer you simply cant drink everyday.  The flavor is relatively nice, but there is simply too much going on.

But the overall impression is more of an ""imperial brown ale,"" with those great, and yet not overpowering, wood flavors.  The alcohol makes itself noticed in a lingering dryness at the end.

For some reason I was not expecting something this dark. Earthy darker malts and sweet mild coffee are the base scents that I catch. A few hints of vanilla extract and some dark cherries. Nothing too extraordinary, but now seeing that this is 12%, there is no sign of this being a big burly brew. Now the flavor is another story. Molasses and lightly burnt sugar in the start. Spiced fruit cake in the middle, with cinnamon, plums, dark raisins and just a hint of dark rum. Dry slightly woody finish and linger. Tight carbonation, which works well with the thicker, somewhat chewy, lip smacking, liquid. Long mild spice linger.

2676,"2008-03-05",3.5,"Dark red/brown, almost opaque, with a medium sized brown head that doesnt last long. Nose is complicated--salty, fairly sweet, a bit of alcohol, some carob and caramel, and slight tannic notes. Flavor is quite sweet, with a nice banana overtone, marked bitterness, and an earthy aftertaste. Slightly tart, almost oaky hints in there, as well as cherries and prunes. Mouthfeel is a bit chalky, and its overcarbonated right now. Might do well to get a bit of age on this one.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
2676,"2008-03-05",4.2,"I was expecting something more akin to Jiahu and Fort from this beer, and was grateful not to get it!  I thought this beer was excellent.  Those others I mentioned...not so much.

Appearance of this was a dark red-black color.  Head was tan and interacted strangely with my glass, as if it were trying to eat through it.  Aroma was extremely roasty with lots of great ""burned pizza crust"" character. Flavor was also very roasty, but had an extremely floral note and some red wine grapiness also.  Most really roasty beers are just that; it takes a lot of flavor to balance with some fruit.  Mouthfeel was quite smooth but not thick...I didnt get the feeling this beer would coat the back of a spoon but it wasnt flat or watery.

I would highly recommend this beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"
2676,"2008-03-05",3.2,"12oz. bottle. Black with virtually no head.
Mild roasted malt aroma with a bit of coffee, vanilla and dark chocolate. Little to no wood detected in the nose. The flavor, on the other hand, is big time wood. Sweet, but not overly so, with a more roasted malt presence than the aroma would lead me to believe. Vanilla, chocolate and strong alcohol kick.

2676,"2008-03-04",4.1,"pours a dense black color, some red shining through under direct light (jsut barely though), with nice tan head, very stout like in appearance. As the head falls back it leaves some nice sticky lacing around the glass. Aroma is rich and sweet with nice notes of woodyness, slight spicyness of alcohol, and dark fruits. All of the aromas blend together quite well to form a richly well balanced, and slightly hard to pick through,  aroma. Onset is nice blend of woody sweetness and just the right amount of bitterness, not to say that this is any way a bitter beer, just weel balanced. Slightly raisiny, again woody, some smoke, and definite alcohol in the middle. Starts out incedibly smooth and silky, somewhat beefy, then turning into a pleasant woody dryness on the finish. Vanilla and pepper also play a role in this complex sipper. Finsih lingers a while turning to bitter sweet dark chocolate late in the finish. This does need some time to figure itself out and I think it is rating less than its potential as a result. Perhaps DFH should have sat on this one a while before release,m though I am excited to have tasted it at such a young age. I have six more for the years to come... perhaps one every six months.

2676,"2008-03-03",3.7,"Bottle.  An interesting concept of a beer to say the least, and I know that DFH is very familiar with going out on a limb as far as brewing is concerned.  Pours out a dark brown color without much of a head at all.  The smell is weird, but not in a bad way, just something I am not familiar with.  Sweet smelling, some hops, some wood flavors, almost a chocolate like smell as well..  Taste has a weird aftertaste at first, but once the palate becomes used to it, it works out very nice.  A rich flavorful offering that hides the 12% very well.  Almost like drinking a stout, but it isnt.

The aroma reminds me of...Dogfish Head actually.  Beyond are light woody aromas and possible cocoa powder.  The flavor is fairly nutty, combined with thick molassesy malt flavors and hidden undertones of wood aging.  The most interesting of all this to me was the very subtle, yet powerful spice notes throughout the body and the finish.  A light burnt flavor is found somewhere after the finish.  Fairly thick on the palate, very sugary (too much), not too carbonated.  The 12%abv is hidden dangerously well.  Definitely another interesting experiment from Dogfish Head...and mostly a successful one at that.","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"

2676,"2008-03-01",3.9,"The beer has a pleasant aroma. A nice malty aroma. I watched the DVD that came with this beer, and they made this huge deal about the wood they used to age the beer. I can say they went way too far with that facet of the brewing process. There is a slight presence of hops, and a nice sugar malt aroma. The aroma is very sweet and very nice. The beer had a decent caramel head that quickly faded away. The beer is pretty much black, and opaque.  Decent appearance, but nothing special . The beer has a very nice roasted malt flavor. I dont know about the special wood that they used for aging the beer, but I have tasted brews that are better that didnt spend $150,000 on a brew tank made of wood. I taste coffee somewhat, but it is mainly the sugar and the malt, a nice roasted flavour. Even though there is a 12% ABV you cant taste that at all. The beer is pretty smooth, but  again nothing special. I like this beer for its malt and sugar aroma and flavor.

2676,"2008-02-29",3.6,"Bottle Date February 2008; Sampled February 2008
Pours with an almost three-finger thick, light brown colored head.  The beer is a deep, burnt amber, dark brown colored head.  Despite being a clear, rich brown color as I pour this beer, it is completely opaque when held up to the light.  Aromas of vanilla, interesting spicy wood that is not the same as from oak (slightly peppery, cinnamon and a touch of fenugreek), candied caramel malt, almost a bit of smoke, .  A substantial fruit character provides notes of cherries, raisins and red grapes mixes very well with the wood aromatics.  The alcohol is hidden quite well, especially given the 12% abv.  Supporting, toasty malt notes, with ample browned bread and biscuit notes and a hint of roast character; really the toasty, browned bread crust like aromas of this beer are quite distinct if you dig around in the aroma for them.  This has a very interesting aroma, the use of the Palo Santo wood definitely adds a unique dimension that is a derivative, but still uniquely distinct from, the more typical oak.

Thick and viscous, though not nearly as sweet as I was expecting.  A creamy, velvety mouthfeel couples with flavors of vanillin, chewy toffee and dark fruit flavors.  This is pretty well carbonated (with a nice prickle to the tongue at the beginning of each sip), but it is thick enough that it is not noticed as much as it would be otherwise.  Concentrated fruit forward flavors of cherries, raisins and blackberries couple with a very light alcohol presence to contribute a Brandy like finish.  This finishes with a toasted soda cracker note at times, but often this takes the backseat to the sweet, concentrated fruit notes that tend to linger on in the mouth.  The wood components are a bit more subdued than in the aroma; it does provide a spicy backbone as well as a bit of tannic astringency, both of which provide a sharp note in the finish that provides balance like hop bitterness would.

As the beer warms up a bit, the aroma really starts to pick up a complex mix of cherry, mace, and distinctly sweet spices.  The aroma of this brew is a bit more intriguing and interesting than the flavor, though that is by no means a dud.  The malt and brown ale character seems to come through more in the aroma as does the wood.  With the added wood component this is one of the more complex, even balanced big beers from Dogfish Head.

2676,"2008-02-23",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2012 Bottle from SL. The pour was deep dark black in color, generous initial chocolate colored head, thinning slowly during comsumption eventually to a nice ring around the edges, lacing ok/splotchy. The aroma was bubblegum, roasted chocolate, light smoke, dried fruits. The flavor followed the aroma, strong presence of the roast/smoke, sweet and bitter (from the roast?) at the same time, along with a sasafrass branch type of spice/wood element. Mouthfeel was full, carbonated strongly for this ABV (forgot to mention, no alcohol detectable at all outside of mouthfeel and malt level, this thing was ethanol smooth in aroma and flavor!), and sticky. A decent concoction, but hard to find anything incredibly novel in the beer from paraguayan palo or santo whatever - in other words, the malts and roast bury the wood for the most part. A nice big huge imperial brown ale. Re-rate, 9/07 at the brewpub on draft: came across much better this time, the wood breaking through all the wonderful (although I didnt think so when I first wrote them) descriptors above. A neat brew, but its a big brown ale indeed. Rating bumping up.

2676,"2008-02-22",3.9,"Bottled 2/11/2008 (11 days ago): Deep brown to black in color this poured a thin brown head that dissipated rather quickly leaving little lacing.  The nose showed sweet wood fig, maple syrup and a touch of vanilla crème.  In the mouth it was a full-bodied beer with great palate weight and richness.  The flavors showed off the wood, chocolate and fig with some hops showing in the slightly dry, bitter finish.  The alcohol is well integrated overall with just a touch showing through on the finish.","Wheaton, Illinois, USA","SQNfan"
2676,"2008-02-22",1.9,"Pours a dark color with a light tan head.  Smells like alcohol with a hint of malt.  Laces well as you drink it.  Light mouthfeel with very little aftertaste.  Has a medium alcohol taste with some notes of roasted malt character.  Very little hop presence.  Not as much wood flavor as I like in wood beers.  And doesnt taste that good either.  Overall a very disappointing beer.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
2676,"2008-02-22",3.9,"Woooow. I admit I was skeptical. ""Great. Another big over the top overdone Dogfish Head beer"". Wow was I wrong. This beer is 12%? This is the first big beer Ive had from this brewer that I can say hides the alcohol beautifully. Aroma of maple syrup and sweet malt. Pour was a deep dark near black with a one finger tan head. Taste was near perfect. Strong caramel and chocolate flavor with a big woodiness. This beer tasted like someone spilled caramel and Hersheys syrup on a piece of wood and you licked it up. Im going to pick up as much of this as I can while I can.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
2676,"2008-02-21",3.9,"Very roasty malts... much like an exaggerated Dogfish Indian Brown.  Relatively small head.  Charred wood smell and nice chocolate, roast, and wood on the palate.  Slight chocolate covered cherries as well.  Not as vanilla/caramel as many wood-aged beers, but in a really nice way.  Surprisingly tasty.  I feel like I like this more than the numerical rating I gave it...","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
2676,"2008-02-21",3.8,"12oz from a 4-pack (with a DVD!).  Bottled on 2/11/08.  Pours very dark brown with a dark foamy brown head.  Looks pitch black in the glass.  A nice aroma on this one.  Can pick out traces of brown ales (a less hoppyDFH Indian Brown comes to mind) as well as some stout like qualities.  Brown sugar, chocolate covered bananas, caramel.  Alcohol nowhere in sight within the aroma.  Taste is smooth, rich, chocolatey, a bit watery even with the alcohol hidden extremely well.  Not too sweet or cloying like some other high alcohol DFH beers.  This beer hides its abv better than almost any other beer I can think of.  I must admit I was not terribly familiar with Paraguayan Palo Santo wood before this beer and I am having trouble picking out any characteristics it imparts.  Regardless this is pretty good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
2676,"2008-02-21",3.4,"This is a dark beer for a brown ale.  It head a light brown head, but it dissipated quickly. It smells a little bitter with sweet and sour hints around the edges.  The taste is a bit sweet with a bit of a roasty finish.  There seems to be a bit of fruit in there as well.  The beer is very smooth in the mouth and you cant really taste the alcohol at all.  Its not a bad beer, but it seems to be missing some balance.  A slight bitter taste might help.","Bozeman, Montana, USA","natejgood"
2676,"2008-02-21",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2009 Bottle shard by mmtmatrix.  Poured a deep brown color with a half-inch thick tan head.  Aroma of the Palo Santo wood, caramel, and some vanilla.  Sweet caramel an toffee malt entry leads into a roasty, woody finish.  I really enjoyed the Palo flavor on the finish, it added a nice earthy character and dried the palate nicely.  Doesnt really drink like a 12% beer, it is pretty smooth.  This seems to have good aging potential.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"

I love brown ales but this is missing something. I had it in the summer of 07 down at the rehobeth brewery and I remember it being so much better. Maybe it just needs to age.

Very nicely balanced with nice roast, coffee, hint of chocolate in there. Not overly complex or mind-blowing, but I could drink this any time of the day and be happy as a clam.

From a fresh bottle, very, very sugary sweet for me, but I feel that with age it can achieve what I first tasted, and Im in a generous mood, so Ill let those numbers stand.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

2676,"2007-06-28",4.5,"Truly a style onto its own. Saved for dessert or a nightcap. Smells of dark chocolate, molasses, and Palo Santo wood (you probably wouldnt know if you havent smelled the wood first). Little alcohol on the nose. Fine carbonation and unfermented sugars lend to a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Fantastic on the palate, bursting with chocolate, molasses, vanilla, slightly smoky and spicy from the wood. Satisfying finish that lingers.","USA","jgasparine"

2676,"2007-06-19",4.4,"On tap - Rehoboth
Not sure how to categorize this one, so I guess ""American Strong Ale"" is probably the most apt...dont be fooled by the ""brown ale"" description, which couldnt be further from the truth.
Very chocolatey with a strong molasses flavor as well.  Smooth - not too carbonated.  I found it nicely hopped, but i also had it on tap, on a night when they hook up the little hop infuser tube to the draft, so its hard to say what it normally tastes like.
If i had to compare it to something, Id say its like the littler brother to Victorys Storm King.  (Granted that one is an imperial stout, but this has several of the same flavors, just not as heavy as an imperial stout).
Watch out for the 12% ABV!

Full, rich deep smoked flavor of peet & mahogany w/some traces of chocolate & molasis. Has quite a kick, this is not one to come in & knock back a few of. Alcohol is quite evedant. This would make a great after dinner/sipping beer; reminds you of a fine Brandy in that reguard. Im sure this would age quite well if they ever bottled it.

Chalky-beige head is medium in size and recedes steadily to partial-cover and ring, leaving little/no lacing.  Clarity is medium to medium-high.The aroma is just steady chocolate and caramel.  Huge, underattenuated malts with a pinch of dry toffee and chewy nougat.  Light vanillin and bubble gum??  Yep, definitely smells of bubble gum or cotton candy.  Very sugary.  Alcohol dosent come out in the aroma too heavily, though there is some expression upon warming.  Pretty monotonous aroma, overall.Though it dosent prepare for the flavor.  Yikes.  What the hell is this?  Its like a bad case of plastics, chemicals and glue all wrapped in to a sugary-sweet mess of a beer.  Horribly sugary, not even thick chocolate/caramel, just fuzzy, sugary adjunct-like flavors with plenty of high fermentation notes (bubble gum, cotton candy, vanillin, sharp fusels).  Cloying quickly.  No real sign of the wood, maybe some light dryness, but its marginal.

2676,"2006-11-17",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2008 Draft at Rehobeth Beach, served in a snifter. The board says its 14% and 35 IBUs. Pours deep brown with a nice frothy brown head. Aroma of wood mulch, nutshells, and caramel. Soft carbonation in the mouthfeel.  Initial brown ale flavor of brown sugar and caramel, some hints of cocoa, but then it quickly gets overpowered by the alcohol. Warming and dry woody flavor on the  finish. Boy, this beer had a lot of alcoholic kick to it. I am not sure a brown ale is meant to have this type of ABV, as it really overpowers the beer. The wood aging definitely helped pull this together.  However, I did enjoy this and would have no problem drinking again. This has potential to be an amazing beer.   Bottled version. Sampled at 50 degrees. Pours a deep coffee brown, almost stout like, with a one finger brown head that dissipates to a ring. Very inviting nose of cocoa powder, dark roast, and wood mulch. Short initial flavor of nuts, molasses, and roasted malts that quickly transitions to aggressive plummy and red wine flavors. Semi-dry and oaky finish is warming with a strong vodka like alcohol presence (not quite as aggressive as the initial draft version). I am going to bump the aroma from 6 to 8 and the overall from 14 to 15.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
