3380,"2016-10-11",3.9,"From notes (June 2016). For a 3.3% ABV beer, this manages to capture everything that makes Trilliums hoppy stuff so fantastic. Its refreshing, juicy, a little dry, and extremely hoppy. Great stuff.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3380,"2016-09-30",4.3,"Poured into a shotglass showing lightly filtered neon yellow with spare white foam. 

The nose shows rich notes of sharp pineapple, kiwi, and light citrus. 

The palate is light bodied and fully carbonated. Forward flavors of sharp kiwi, lemon, and pineapple. Mid-palate shows pears and a very lightly tart finish. Dry, low alcohol, incredibly refreshing.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
3380,"2016-09-26",3.9,"Can shared, on the street. Cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma of grapefruit, tropical fruits, mango, light citrus, light passion fruit, dank notes. Flavour is light sweet and moderate bitter. Above light bodied with soft carbonation. [15-07-2016]","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"
3380,"2016-08-18",3.7,"Hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Sharp citrus and tropical fruit hop nose. Light mouthfeel with some oat and raw grains, citrus, pineapple, tropical fruit and a hint of an earthy dankness in the finish. It drinks much bigger than 3.3%. Tasty session IPA.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

3380,"2016-07-22",4.3,"Canned 6/20/16 and drunk fresh (6/23/16) and a month old, 7/21/16.Medium-haze to this peachy-golden beer with a large, white, well-retained head atop.Obviously the fresh sample proved a bit better but Ill be damned if I didnt highly enjoy the month-old version of this 3.3% abv hoppy beer. Very telling of the extremely high quality brewing going on at Trillium, but I guess thats nothing too shocking, if youve had their beer.Anyways, awesome fruitiness in the nose shows restrained mango-pineapple juiciness, with big nectarine-apricot notes and moderate citrics. Tangerine notes give some pleasant tanginess and the crackery, light malts lie beneath, with a bit of ester/house yeast character adding strong minerality on the finish.Very dry in the flavor, but just impressively soft and not given to any huskiness/astringency. Nectarine-tangerine juiciness with light pineapple and touches of grapefruit. Cracker and biscuit malts give a pleasing, lightly grainy texture with dollops of honey throughout the finish and plentiful melon and aforementioned fruits lingering quite juicily.Such a wonderfully-brewed beer with a light body, tight carbonation and lighlty watery texture. Theyve crammed a lot of flavor and finesse in this tiny beer and its just laughably ridiculous to read how this beer is too light, watery and bland.  Go drink a Dark Lord, bro.  Still, encouraged to see that most people ""got it"".","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3380,"2016-07-12",4.1,"Can. Hazy yellow pour with white head. Peach, lactose, floral tropical aromas. Herbal, citrus, dank hoppy aromas. Light bodied, single hopped mosaic, easy to drink.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3380,"2016-07-11",3.4,"16 oz. can. Very pale orange. Smells of white pepper, garlic, orange, and cracker malt. Tastes a little less exciting. Orange with no sweetness. A hint of garlic and pepper. Light cracker malt and faint bitterness. Very light. Probably shouldnt have had this so late in the tasting, but its nice.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3380,"2016-07-11",3.0,"Creepy can with a bikini on it and coverage for a third tit. Anyways, opaque yellow pour with a white head. Almost Pilsner like bouquet. Hmmm, well its kinda bland hoop notes and then nothing else. Not well balanced with a muted malt backbone. Below average body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
3380,"2016-07-09",3.2,"16oz can pours a hazy golden color with a bit of head. Some tropical fruit hoppiness, but some wateriness shows through and weak enough to taste the carbonation.","California, USA","Bule"
3380,"2016-07-04",4.0,"Tasted on 7/4/16 from a 16oz can, big thanks to Alex for this one. Pours murky orange with a thick, rocky white head that slowly recedes to average, sticky lace. The nose is super intense tropical fruit, floral, and citrus, with tons of pineapple, star fruit, orange pith, lemon zest, and grass jumping out of the can as soon as I open it. Underlying, there are also notes of dusty pine, some earthy bread yeast, and the faintest white flour malt. The flavor has all of the same qualities, but with all of the pretty tropical fruit and floral notes more subdued, and the citrus and earthy tones taking over with just a bit of light bitterness. The body is tremendously light with lively carbonation and a medium lightly bitter citrus peel and earthy finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
3380,"2016-06-26",4.0,"Can care of Keith shared with Owen, Jim, and siabon. Pours hazy and murky yellow goldeb with small white head . Notes of lemon rind, grapefruit, grain, cracker, and lager. Almost like boat. Really nice","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3380,"2016-06-25",4.0,"Every bit as flavorful as a higher ABV IPA. The typical hazy appearance and over-the-top hoppiness in the aroma and taste that Trillium has us accustomed too. Love them. This is a fricken session IPA, screw the others.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
3380,"2016-06-20",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2016 Pours hazy pear into a snifter. White head with little retention recedes to nothing. Mango and passion fruit aromas. Soft and thin, but still enjoyable given the low abv, mostly likely due to the copious amounts of solids. Yeast, lemon/lime, summer pit fruit and marshmallow upfront turning to grapefruit before the lasting dusty fruit skin and pith finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
