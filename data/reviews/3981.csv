Pours jet black-attractive reddish tan head. Super hoppy without being bitter and dark without any cloying sweetness. Nice pine and earthy notes. Great balance. Really, really well done. Again.","","woodychevy"

Mouthfeel is bright and fresh, very easy drinking - well balanced black IPA. the pine and citrus and balanced extremely well against the soft earthy roasted character - and while no malt/roast/smoke flavor over dominates. Very well crafted black IPA.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3981,"2014-10-20",4.3,"GABF. Pours a nice dark brown color with a very light tan head. The resiny hops and the roasted malt play really nice together. Quite drinkable and smooth. Awesome black IPA. KCorum10, you need to try this if you havent.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

Notes of chocolate, toasted and roasted malts, earthy and citrusy hops, dust, and grilled fruits. Medium-full bodied, with moderate carbonation and a roasty, bitter mouthfeel. Nice, big black IPA. I probably would like this even better without so much palate fatigue. Really well done.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Medium body with average carbonation and a long lasting aftertaste. Flavor is the same as the aroma with the addition of some coffee notes. Really nice.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

Stunning.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

One of only two black IPAs that I remember that are both black and taste like an IPA.
Pours black with a tan head.

3981,"2014-02-08",3.8,"Draft to taster at Wicked Weed during RBWG. Looks good; an opaque motor oil with beige head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells good too; lots of well-balanced hops with notes of dark malt and mild roast. Tastes like it smells with notes of chocolate and a good mouthfeel. Good beer!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3981,"2014-02-06",3.9,"Draft - Dark roast with nice grapefruit hops to balance. Jet black with a rich beige head. Lots of roast with the grapefruit and hops coming through to balance. Very nice with the hops playing lead, alcohol is not there so a dangerous beer at such a high ABV.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"

3981,"2013-05-24",4.8,"Comes out of the tap.a rich,warm sable just a whisker above jet - not much head, but that is apparently an artifact of the pour. Strongly hoppy aroma is mainly resins, like a superior IPA, with hints of roast malt and licorice. Powerful flavor floods the palate with hops, woody and resiny; roast malt, and hints of coffee and licorice. Smooth, firm texture has a strong alcohol bite so you feel it going all the way downstairs. Get ruff with this Ruffian! (But not TOO ruff - or at least call a cab.)","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
3981,"2013-04-09",4.1,"32 ounce growler from the brewpub. Pours a clear dark brown color with a thin frothy brown head. Good head retention. Aroma of roasted malts and herbal and pine hops. The taste is intense pine hops, resin, herbal notes as well, lots of chocolate and a bitter roast finish. Medium bodied, lingering bitterness, faintly boozy and much more drinkable that it should be for the ABV. Nicely done.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3981,"2013-03-06",3.9,"On tap at the Wicked Weed. This pours opaque black into the glass with a thin ring of eggshell-hued suds that leaves trace lace. The nose is woodsy and spiced, of spruce and pine. Flavors have sweet malt, lots of resin, piney bitters and a hint of ABV, which is superbly integrated. Substantive yet slick and refreshing, this is a great brew from the Weed.

3981,"2013-02-28",4.0,"Growler from the brewpub. Dang man. This another awesome brew.  Ruffian achieves supreme dank hoppiness in the aroma with a solid roasty body. Malts are hearty, but not overpowering and not super thick. This allows the citrus and pine to cut right through. Finish is a little ashy and eventually citrusy.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3981,"2013-02-26",3.9,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized tan colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a no visible carbonation opaque dark ruby red brown colored body and a fair lacing. The mild aroma was dark malt. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a medium hoppy aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of strong malt sweet dark malt and hops. Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
