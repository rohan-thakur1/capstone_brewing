1517,"2017-03-28",3.6,"Draught at Gather, 2/4/17.Similar to extra pulp, its not ""pulpy""-looking at all, but rather has a rosy-peach hue with ruddy amber notes and a fairly high clarity. Beige head atop is small and shows moderate retention.Juicy fruits in the nose show peach, pineapple (light), mango and melon. Low on the grapefruit and pine with honey and light bread/biscuit behind it. No alcohol or flaw. Bright and just enough citrus to balance the juiciness and ample, backing malts.In the mouth its well-malted, but well-attenuated as well, with mango, peach and apricot as the primary flavor drivers. Honey and bread create more than enough malt backbone and the texture is soft with an engaging carbonation. Beer is clean with no alcohol noted. Well-made stuff, very enjoyable and low on haze for those who get all up in arms about that yet still like NE IPAs.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1517,"2017-03-14",4.1,"Nice extra from a trade. Clear gold with thick persistent head and nice lacing. Nose is awesome cirtrus and pine hops. Taste is bitter and balanced with round mouthfeel. Flavors of citrus hops, grapefruit. This was great...never would think this is a wheat ale....along the lines of the Modern Times wheat that drinks like an IPA (Fortunate Islands?).","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
1517,"2017-02-22",3.5,"[2/4/17] Draught at Gather in Boston. Golden. Nice juicy fruity hops aroma, tropical and somewhat oniony. Dry flavor, bitterish. Medium-bodied. Good.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
1517,"2017-02-16",3.7,"Crowler - Intense citrus peel. Clear gold with a small white head. Citrus, fleshy and a long orange finish.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
1517,"2017-02-16",3.6,"Bright, light amber. On the nose, it has some gooseberry stuff, a little overripe fruit, light breezy pale malts. Has a nice fruity hop character, light pale malts. No real wheat character. Good brew, quite refreshing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1517,"2017-02-16",3.2,"Crowler @ Oates. Pours a clear golden colour with a thin white head. Nose is lightly resinous, citrus, and tropical fruits. Flavour is IPA bitter like, biscuit/bread malt, with a mild bitter finish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"
1517,"2017-02-16",3.3,"Crowler, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out gum balls, bubblegum and tropical fruity hops. Flavour is more like a bitter IPA, with fruity hops, some bubblegum and biscuity malt. Fairly bitter finish. More like an IPA. Solid stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1517,"2017-02-13",3.7,"Nose of big orange, cool hoppy juicy citrus with a soft malt base - wheat and pale malt. Pours orange golden, not filtered but not particularly HAZY like all the clowns like it. Flavors of juicy orange, soft wheat malt, citrus hops. Balanced and drinkable. Well done, cool beer. Like the last dude not sure how its really a wheat ale as it is hopped like an IPA but solid nonetheless.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
1517,"2016-10-07",3.9,"1 week old Crowler from trade with Luis. Aroma: huge orange pulp aroma and some other citrus, light herbs. App: hazy golden with orange tint, small white head leaving some little lacing. Taste and palate: medium body, resinous and a tad juicy and a tad watery, not much but just enough that I can notice it, clean light to moderate bitter finish. Overall: this drinks nicely. Im surprised this is considered a wheat ale. I understand the base is a wheat ale but with all that hop this is far from it. Its a white ipa at best. Even there, we cant feel much the wheat base. Great drinkability. Wish I could have drank it more fresh.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"
1517,"2016-09-30",4.0,"Draft at source. Super juicy nose. Taste is straight dank. Crisp malt. Straight yummy.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
1517,"2016-08-08",2.2,"Can @ Monkish. Thanks to Sean for sending this my way. This beer is ugly af. Murky penny water with no foam. I wouldnt say it tastes as bad as it looks, but its also not very pleasant. Toasted grain water, some citrus juice, and a fairly watery mouthfeel. At least some good citric hop flavor and a bit of pine. Kind of bitter and herbal on the finish. Not a good first impression from this brewery.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
1517,"2016-07-15",3.9,"Can many thx Homer321 and many thx Mats for bringing it home to Sweden cons 2016-07-16 Göteborg, - Extra local bonus fro Hom321 - local and top Wheat Ale, thx Sir!
AR: mango pure, apricot, mandarine juice
AP: milky coppery juice, frothy deminshing white fluff
F: mandarine zest, mango pure, dried apricot, bitter +, loads of starch, great Wheat!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Nisse666"
1517,"2016-06-12",3.7,"16oz can. 5/27/16 package date. Appearance: Cloudy, pale golden, with minimal white foam head. Looks a bit under carbonated. 
Aroma: Tropical fruit hop bomb. Pineapple, mango, even a touch of strawberry. Also an underlying grassy resin. Wonderful. 
Taste: Very light wheaty maltiness followed by a grassy, resinous, strawberry hop character that leads into a moderate bitterness. A touch of orange peel pops up on the swallow. 
Mouthfeel: Light body with a low carbonation
Finish: Dry, with a nice balance of malt and bitterness, with some residual hop resin on the tongue. 
Overall: An amazing aroma for an American Wheat, reminiscent of a top notch IPA, but this can was under carbonated and the body of the beer seemed light, even for an American Wheat. Id definitely consider this the best American Wheat Ive had, but still has room for improvement. Could have a world class beer here.","","TH28"
1517,"2016-06-11",3.5,"Can pours out a hazy pale straw color topped with a small head. Nose is big hops citrus orange juice and light sweetness..taste is more of the citrus hops orange juice notes a nice hoppy beer would not call this a wheat beer at all.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
1517,"2016-05-07",3.5,"The aroma has lots of tropical and citrus esters, light dank and pepper too. The taste is more subdued as can be expected from a wheat IPA. Smooth feel and pretty crushable.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1517,"2016-04-21",4.0,"Poured a cloudy milky gold color with aromas of hops, citrus nectarines, dankness and heaven. Flavors aromas citrus and fresh hops, tropical fruit light wheat this stuff is JUICY and refreshing this is some solid stuff. My mouth wants more!","Florida, USA","burg326"
1517,"2016-04-21",3.8,"crowler thanks to collin. Sweeter and a little more booze flavor than your typical northeast style IPA but the hops are there. Tons of citrus aromas and flavors.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1517,"2016-04-09",3.7,"Draft... Pours cloudy and yellow with a small, brief white. Tiny white collar. The aroma features juicy tropical fruits and freshly cut melons. Light-bodied and dry with fizzy carbonation. The flavor offers a moderate level of tropical and musky hop bitterness accompanied by some wheat, but the grains are mostly understated. Crisp, clean, lightly bitter finish that sticks around a good while. Stupid crushable.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1517,"2016-04-04",3.5,"From a shared crowler filled less than 2 weeks ago.

Clear golden body with a good head.
This is a very hoppy and fruity wheat ale. Light bitterness. Wheat flavors rather than hop bitterness gains in the finish and aftertaste.

Medium light body and carbonation.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
1517,"2016-03-28",4.4,"Crowler thanks to Blum. Pours a hazy yellow orange with medium frothy white head head leaving sticky lacing. The aroma is tropical fruit, dank hop, nectarine skin. Medium mouth, very juicy, nectarine, mango, light bitterness, crushable, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
1517,"2016-03-11",4.4,"Can/crowler - 20 days after canning and shipping to Europe - those crowlers are great. Back to beer - it pours slightly hazy, nice orange in colour and white head. Aroma is pure mango and passionfruit, very intense and sweet. In taste really fruity as well, more in mango/orange way, low sweetness. I expected it to have a bit more body as it felt a bit too watery, more maltiness (slightly) and it would be perfect. Finish is bitter and citrusy. Wow, this is really great beer (outstanding aroma). Note - this is more wheat IPA (?) than american wheat in my opinion.","Poznań, POLAND","mateuszk"
1517,"2016-02-06",4.2,"On tap at the brewery. Hazy bright orange. Smell is all orange hops. Wheat behind it. Taste is equally strong on the orange hops. Low sweetness. A bit of malt doughiness. Hop bite is a little garlicky. Finish is wheat grain. Medium body. Listed as a wheat, but clearly inspired by a citrus IPA profile. Really nice.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
1517,"2016-02-05",4.5,"L: This is a pretty beer. the head and its retention was stunning. the head just sat there for a few mins, allowing me to snap a few beerporn pics. it slowly evaporate but the lacing stays there on the glass as you drink this down

S: if my house could smell like this, I would be so stoked. I opened the crowler and could smell it from 2-3 feet away easily. as I have the beer in front of me, about a foot from my face on the desk, I can still really pick up the tropical fruits and herbal-ness of this. the mosiac is strong with this. the Columbus is a bit more subtle. 

t: think tree house, not so much trillium. Trillium is the top of the top IPAs, and Tree House has that distinct difference that is still incredible, but its still missing something that I cant put my finger on. The initial taste and the after taste are not that present, hence I dropped it to a 4.5, but the middle, when its fully coating your mouth, is wonderful. 

f: im pounding a crowler of this, solo, with ease. its not overly bitter at all, but its also not like getting kicked in the mouth with citra, its a bit more balanced. the mosaic is really present here. 

Overall, This is a mighty fine beer that I had close to no expectations from. my buddy Steve sent me this, and while I knew he knew what he was sending, I still feel like I owe him big time. not only was this an unsolicited beer, I couldnt be happier.","Tampa, Florida, USA","sonnysideup"
1517,"2016-02-05",4.4,"Milky yellow pour with a white head. Stone fruit and hop bouquet. Shit man, this is delicious. Stone fruit, nectarine, orange; wow this is a real stunner. Sturdy malt backbone. Caramel undertones and a smoothness from the wheat. So impressed.","Florida, USA","50belair"
