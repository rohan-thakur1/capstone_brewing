It is dry and avoids being an Aventinus clone. Its a good beer that I wish stylistically was more available.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

3769,"2016-06-16",4.2,"24 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/30/2016. Pours hazy very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces t oa nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty ospay lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, wheat, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, banana, bubblegum, clove, raisin, plum, apple, light chocolate, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, wheat, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, banana, bubblegum, clove, raisin, plum, apple, light chocolate, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal bitterness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, wheat, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, banana, bubblegum, clove, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from bitter/spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and nearly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding dunkel weizenbock style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3769,"2016-06-01",3.6,"Type: 24-oz. bottle 
Glass: Clear 23-oz. wheat beer glass
From: Costco in Goleta (Santa Barbara), Calif.
Price: $7.50 ($30 for a High Altitude variety 4-pack) 
Purchased: May 29, 2016
Consumed: May 31, 2016
Misc.: Packaged on March 30, 2016 at 1:50 p.m. PT; ABV is actually 7.2 pct.

Looking forward to this one after finally pulling the trigger and getting this high altitude four-pack for $30 at Costco, down from a previous price I saw for $40 at Barons. Really got it for the Barrel-Aged Bigfoot, but definitely interested in the rest. Have only had a few Dunkelweizens, but have enjoyed each of them. 

Poured a light brown (est. 14-17 lovibonds), murky color with 2-to-3 fingers of khaki-white, frothy head. Serene setting underneath the head. Outstanding uneven foamy lacing. Outstanding retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled banana bread, cloves, red apple, plum, dark fruits, Circus Peanuts candy and hints of either rye or pumpernickel bread. (Smell - 4.00)

Tasted similar to the nose, maybe slightly toastier. Specifically got banana bread, spoiled banana, dark fruits (plum and red apple), toasted bread, sweet caramel, thin, sugary molasses and banana milkshake. Does not taste anywhere near 7.2 pct. ABV. (Taste - 3.75)

Light-to-medium body. Oily-to-thin texture. Lively carbonation. Rather long finish. (Feel - 4.00)

This was very nice, but I may have just slightly overrated it on at least one category. Nice and smooth though. (Overall - 4.00)

3769,"2016-05-16",3.5,"24oz bottle. Pretty solid Dunkelweizen, pronounced banana tones, mild brown chocolate. Fresh, quite drinkable, but sort of leans into those banana hefe notes quite hard. Chocolate covered banana all day. Doesnt really strike me as that special of a beer to charge 8 dollars for a bomber of. Comes off very American. In some ways that is good..freshness, ingredients, but it doesnt have those deep, depthful tones of a good Weizenbock, really has no ""Bock"" tone at all. OK.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

3769,"2016-04-28",3.4,"On tap at the Torpedo Room. It pours a muddy brown color with a light tan head. The aroma is nice with strong banana, hints of clove and toasted malt. The flavor is banana central. Theres some supporting black pepper and clove notes, but the banana is dominant. Its full bodied with some strong toasted and lightly woody malts. A little astringency, likely due to so much yeast in suspension. Overall, decent.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

3769,"2015-12-31",3.6,"On tap on New Years Eve in the NC Sierra Nevada Taproom. 

Clear but very dark reddish-brown body topped by a good head that leaves sheets of lacing. 

Aroma: typical sweet weizenbock aspects but of exceptional appeal. 

Flavor: follows the nose excepting the mild overall bitterness. Alsohol esters make the high ABV more obvious here than in the nose or feel. 

Feel: Near medium body and medium carbonation. 

Overall: fine example of a style that is not one of my favorites.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
