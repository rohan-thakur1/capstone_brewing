3528,"2016-03-27",3.3,"650 mL bottle. Brown body. A little transparent. Smells of coffee and nutty malts. Taste is also strong coffee. But the malt is just a bit stronger. Its still a lot of coffee, but just enough malt to back it up. Nutty malts and a bit of bitterness. Light body. Well carbonated. Not my favorite.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3528,"2016-01-16",3.7,"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown color ale with a medium size off-white foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of coffee and hazelnut is pretty interesting. Taste is a nice mix between some hazelnut, some dry floral coffee notes with a light green finish. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Nice take on a style we see not enough of in North America.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
3528,"2016-01-02",3.8,"Draft, Pitch black. 3 finger very creamy off white head. Sticky lacing. The aroma is 100% cold brew with cream and a distinct sweet aroma. Good mouthfeel. Creamy with a good sweetness that lingers. The coffee flavor is aggressive up front but it doesnt linger.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3528,"2016-01-01",3.8,"Draft at Worth Burger. Almost black in color, mild spotty lace along the snifter. The aroma is fresh roasted coffee beans, mild roasted grain and sugar. The flavor is just coffee forward and bold as the aroma. The body of beer still has the lighter (session) feel without showing any watery character. The coffee lingers in the finish with a dry roasted texture. The Brewer really has something special with a 4.5 % mild ale. Wow","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3528,"2015-12-24",3.3,"Pours cola, some head and lots of lacing. Nose is tobacco. Flavours tobacco, wet leaves, grain, earthy bitterness and coffee. Taste is light bitter and light sweet. Light body with lively carbonation.","Ontario, CANADA","rejtable"
