3319,"2014-11-10",4.0,"Draft at Brauerei Bayer Theinheim in Aug. 2014: Deep golden. Tight halo of white foam. Clean and focused aroma of uncured hay, aniseed, lemon, fresh baguette, rustic yeast, sulfur, minerals and toasted crackers. Soft and lush mouthfeel. Tongue-scrubbing minerals trail a burst of phenol-like sulfur, fresh baguette pils malt, and refined honeysuckle-nectar-drenched hops. Artfully incorporated toastiness gently scratches at the tongue yet is remarkably edgeless at the same time, allowing it to gel seamlessly with the strikingly soft and fluffy body. Luscious and bouncy malt matches the succulent Hallertau nectar pervasiveness. Yeast marks the body with ample rusticity, throughout. Hops acquire more depth as appetizing lemony hops brightly sizzle and accentuate the oily-sweet nectar dimensions. Closes dry and clean as a whistle, yet fully malty and notably rounded, with blooming baguette and new-mown hay capped by a gripping surge of minerals and sulfury yeast. A well made rendition that comes off as a helles / kellerbier hybrid. One of the more minerally examples out there, without question. About as dry and snappy as they come, and distinctly pure overall. Wonderful beer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3319,"2014-08-14",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2015 From draft at Brauerei Bayer. Nearly clear gold body with a fluffy lasting white head. 
- Perle, Hallertau Tradition, Hallertau Hallertau hops (changed to Saphir in 2015), but the lemon juiciness screams Spalt Select for me. Oily and slick with low acidity until late. Carbonation is somewhat low and loose but works well. Malt is honey-pastries and succulent. Off-dry, juicy, peppery and slightly phenolic. Really juicy and bright, some acid developing late in the finish. Musty / minerallic / sulfuric (light). Very clean and juicy hoppy example of Franconian kellerbier.
