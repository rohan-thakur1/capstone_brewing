1666,"2013-12-12",1.9,"Das Bier im Glas tiefschwarz mit beigem, sehr stabilem und grobporigem Schaum. 
Im Antrunk ist das Bier leicht rauchig-säuerlich. Nicht so dickflüssig wie erwartet, eher schon an der Grenze zum Wässrigen. Der Hauptteil ist leider recht körperlos, angenehme rauchmalztöne zusammen mit Espresso-Kaffeenoten und dunkler Schokolade - aber alles sehr verhalten und nichts wirklich charakteristisch. Sind die hier nicht in der Lage, bei 5,5% ein vernünftiges körperreiches Bier zu brauen? 
Der Nachgeschmack ist dominiert von einer sehr wässrigen Grundnote. Die tollen Stout-Aromen wagen sich kaum hinter der dicken Wasserschicht hervor, das leicht rauchige Röstmalz schafft es gerade so eben, sich noch etwas länger als das Wasser im Mund zu halten. Auch eine ganz leichte Herbe ist jetzt wahrnehmbar. 
--> richtig enttäuschend!! Alle Aromen vorhanden, mit denen ich dem Bier ohne Probleme 15 Punkte geben würde - wäre da nicht dieser dominant wässrige Körper, der alle tollen Aromen im Ansatz ertränkt! 
Leider schon wieder ein Beispiel misslungenen amerikanischen Bieres! Schade! 
Trotzdem vielen Dank an Chris für dieses Bier!!

1666,"2011-05-18",3.3,"Bottle courtesy of BeerFMAndy. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

Pour brings forward a beer that is nearly black and has a thin tan head. Some spotty lacing and not so great retention, though theres a thin collar throughout. The nose brings a bit of coffee alongside a strong base of roasted malt. The flavor is a bit more complex, adding in some dark chocolate alongside the dark, dark coffee. Roasted malt is dominant and becomes a bit too dry and bitter in the finish. Pretty solid effort; Id have this again.

Pours a very dark blackish hue, some good haze, ruby bottom and some on the edges, but pretty dark overall, with a decent frothy light brown head, dies to a good layer, laces ok. Aromas are roasted malts, toast, and soda bread, some touches of coffee, a touch of smoky ash, more roasted barley, dry. Initial is medium bodied, dry and roasty up front, with good toast, bread, biscuits, soda bread, toffee, and coffee. Into the middle we get some peaty smoke, ashy and peaty, earthy smoke with some touches of toffee sweetness. Really quite dry and roasty overall, a bit heavier on the palate than Im used to from the Dry Stout category. I like the peaty smoke, it give sa unique feel and as a Smokehead I appreciate it. Lingering on into the finish, dry roast, peaty smoke, wood, ash, and touches of sweetness peeking through. If anything it loses itself a bit in its identity, but the uniqueness of a peaty smoke push towards dominance is quite pleasant, albeit a bit big on the palate. I liked this, I wouldnt drink it all the time but it certainly was unique. Aromas was lacking, appearance was good, flavors were very nice, and it might have been a touch too dry, but thats just me nitpicking.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Aroma: Smells like a lot of dry stouts Ive had in my day. Just a wee bit of bittersweet chocolate comes through to the nose. Quite pleasant, actually.

Appearance: For all intents and purposes, this beer is is an opaque black. It pours with a fingers width of khaki colored head.

Taste: Not nearly as bitter as I was expecting. In fact, this stout is quite sweet for a ""dry"" stout (a very strong chocolate taste to it, slightly lighter caramel notes). Got the lovely malty backdrop I like in a stout of this style, but the unusual sweetness is the star attraction.

Palate: Pretty smooth on the palate. Has a moderately thick body to it. None of the flavors linger too long in the mouth.

Overall: An excellent offering from Furthermore. The sweetness of the beer was a bit surprising, but very welcome. One of the best dry stouts Ive ever had.","Wisconsin, USA","AbsoluterZero"

Nose: smoke, wood chips  cedar comes to mind, burnt wood esters, and dry brittle bakers chocolate chunks. Faint plums and prunes in the back; sweetness of meats then bitter nip of the skins. Black root and black strap molasses mingle with the earthen smoky burnt essence.

Palate: medium mouthfeel and weight with a prominent burnt bitterness. Burnt wood, peat, smoke, and some nicely aged cedar. Dry finish with smoke in the breath. Black root, more wood, black strap molasses charred and tastefully crusty. Brittle chocolates in the back of each quaff. Plum skins linger long with the subtle bitterness found only in the very end while plum meats tantalize along with a sweet chewy dark raisins in middle quaff.

The nose gives initial characters of toffee and dark chocolate, along with a bit of caramel; more than one would expect in a dry stout.  As the sample warms, more smoke character becomes apparent, although not to the point that it could truly be considered a smoked beer.  The palate replicates many of the noses advertisements, especially with regard to the nice interplay of caramel, toffee, and roasted character.  Hop bitterness or flavor is not obviously detectable.  The finish is fairly dry, fairly smokey, and fairly clean.

Comes across more alky than 5.5%.  Oh yes, quite burnt and bitter at times but certainly not over  the top.  Above average fer sure. Notsure if I really taste any peat in there or not, just a bad ass stout without going impy on ya.  This is new around here and was glad to have had the chance to taste it. Got it at 3 sons. Yep, the peat is not real apparent, just seems real stouty.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
1666,"2010-03-26",3.7,"A delicious and smokey stout. Aroma was pretty good. Deep dark roasted malt with a slight earthiness to it. Pour was a nice deep dark brown/near black with a one finger tan head. Taste was very full. Strong roasted malt with a deep peaty smokiness that made the beer very unique and delicious. You could classify this beer as a smoked beer as easily as a dry stout. Excellent strong carbonation. Will buy again","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
1666,"2010-03-15",3.7,"Bottled. First impressions were very good, though things have dropped off a little bit as it warmed. I tried to pair this with a Five Spice Pork noodle dinner but it didnt quite pair up, so this ended up warming a bit much. There is quite a bit of campfire, peaty smoke in the aroma, with a hickory and chimney-like quality to it. Further inspection yields sea salt, caramel, and marshmallow. No astringency to be found, and little roast. In the aroma, this comes across more as a smoked than a stout.

Flavor is pretty bright, milky, with a lightly sour finish, in the best English traditions. Decent body, well integrated carbonation, with a carbonic finish. Overall a nice, smoky stout, though the Dry Stout categorization seems a bit off, at least as we brew them today.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

1666,"2010-02-05",3.9,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a flat black body with a one finger fizzy light brown head that faded to a thin covering.  I love the nose, theres a nice peat smoke level over a dry roasty malt base.  Some light coffee, bakers chocolate, and some briney notes.  Based on the nose Id say this could pass for a Smoked beer.  The flavor is rather aggressively smoky, much more so than I was expecting.  Its not crazy smoky, but its clearly the dominant flavor.  Roasty and chocolaty below the smoke, this really hits my sweet spot.  I wish the body were a little thicker and softer though, it is a bit watery on the finish.  Overall its pretty darn great, I wish I would have picked up a sixer of this one.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Taste is full and dry, with an initial flavor of peat, smoke, and roasted malt hitting hard before a mellow aftertaste of tobacco and bitter coffee.

Theres a bit of a malty character that sneaks in once the beer warms a bit, but that store-brand-charcoal-light-with-too-much-lighter-f still hangs in there.

As the beer warms, it changes character, becomes somewhat sour and vinous, the earthiness is now like red beet, with a significant chocolate-bitter undertone.  As the head dissipates, mouthfeel becomes decidedly dry.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"

A frothy tan head displays decent retention, leaving scant, sticky lines of lace on the glass.  The aroma is roasty, showing baker’s chocolate, scorched caramel, roasted barley, and fresh coffee.  An earthy hop bitterness is soothed by notes of lactic cream and dry nuts.  Flavors continue the dry and roasty theme.  Coffee, chocolate, and a touch of smokiness meet smooth cream and bitter woody notes.  Medium in palate with balanced carbonation, the finish is dry, with lingering roast.

1666,"2007-10-08",3.6,"12oz bottle, no date.  Black with a 1/2 finger fizzy tan head, pretty decent retention after rousing it up a bit.  Lovely aroma of campfire and peated malt (usually I think these are one of the same, but I can pick out each of them here), and some roasted malts.  Not really picking up on any sweetness here, nor is it very complex, but so far, so good.  Flavor is much the same with a light caramel sweetness before the dry roasty char finish hits.

This was much better when it warmed significantly (near room temperature) than when cold.

A mild but pleasant hint of Costa Rican light roast.  Silky.  Oceanic peat tones on the tongue, complemented by vanilla, coffee with  a lot of milk and sugar , or coffeecake.  Lactose dominates a bit with warmth.  A touch of citrus in a chocolate-orange sweetness.  Palate is rich, and a mite underdeveloped, vaguely lacking in nuance.  Well made, all said.  Underrated.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1666,"2007-07-24",3.3,"An above average but not great stout.  If not for the hint of peat, it would be fairly unremarkable, and the peat really is just a hint.  The nose has some nice toasty notes.

1666,"2007-07-21",4.0,"Bottle and served in a pint glass: Pour a cola deep brown with a mostly lasting beige head and some lace. The aroma is surprisingly nice with notes of English tobacco, smoked and peat malts,  light chocolate, licorice, walnut, grassy hops,  and mineral esters. The taste is not as powerful but for a dry stout it is more than your average flavor profile.  I really like how the smoke and peat sneaks into the finish after the basic stout malt notes are gone. I even got a hint of wood upon the aftertaste. The mouth feel is about the only place this beer is standard run-of-the-mill with an underwhelming thinnish body compared the flavor profile. I really dug this brew and vastly underrated IMO. I wish I had bought more bottles to share with others...okay Wisconsin raters, get the word out!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1666,"2007-07-13",3.7,"Bottled.  Poured very deep brown with rising carbonation and a very nice initial cap of deep beige head.  The aroma was just what I was looking for with deeply-roasted chocolates and well-integrated smoky peat.. I likes a little salty bacon with my chocolate!  Flavor was damn close, with a solid dose of deep roast, but less of the chocolate distinction.. again the peat stars and is very well executed.. dry-roasted cocoa and mild smoke linger for a medium-length finish.  Just shy of medium-bodied and dry as advertised on the palate.. decent flow.  Good stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1666,"2007-06-20",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. Yeasty aroma features coffee notes and a sweet, chocolatey maltiness. The smoke smell is peaty and bacony, like a cross between a Scotch ale and a rauchbier (although much more subdued than a rauchbiers aroma). Pours an opaque black with a huge amount of grayish tan head. Produces extensive lacing. A smoke flavor dominates the taste, although it is subtle. The underlying strout is sweet and chocolatey, whereas I was expecting a dry, coffeeish, Irish-style stout. A light roasted coffee character does develop after multiple sips and in the finish. The taste is really good, but the flavors are not complex enough to earn a particularly high score (that is, if I could cull a couple more flavors out of this brew, I could have given it an 8 or a 9 for flavor). Surprisingly light, coffee-bitter aftertaste. Low in carbonation, despite the large head. Medium body. Smooth in the palate. Furthermore Three Feet Deep (thats a lot of ""e""s!) unexpectedly ends up going the rauchbock route rather than the peaty, dry stout route, with a ham sweetness emphasized over a smoky, roasted dryness. I think the beer is better off for the choice, although Id argue that it is marketed inappropriately (see the commercial description above). This is a good start from a relatively new brewer. Im a sucker for a good smoke beer, and this definitely qualifies in that category.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
1666,"2007-06-03",3.6,"Barely translucent and inky brown in color with a lasting, mossy and brown khaki head. The smoked nature hits the nose with toasted apple wood, flame struck brown paper bags and peat wrapped with brown sugar glaze. Some lactic milk chocolate pulls through to round out a well composed nose. Flavor slides in more lightly, with hard to ignore carbonation teaming with watered down mocha grinds and slightly scorched campfire twigs, the morning after the chocolate et marshmallow have abandoned the stick. Subtle smoky edges team with a Swiss chocolate bittersweet suggestive digestif. The carbonation pulls distractingly away from the flavor easement, but a hint of smoked espresso grinds keeps Three Feet Deep from going six feet under. Flame touched rubber chocolates see us through to the finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

1666,"2007-05-12",3.1,"Dark brown to black with small lacing left behind.  A different smell right off the bat, as it has a acidic smell.

1666,"2007-04-30",3.6,"12oz bottle. Pours black with some nice creamy whitish/brown lacing and a small head to match. Nice aroma... like JK said, perhaps more of a smoke beer. Notes of dry cocoa, smoked malt, and yes... I think a hint of dried peat. Firm on the palate. Flavors of roasted malt, peat, cocoa, nuts all lead to a rather disappointing finish... a tad cardboard-y and watery. The finish distracts from an otherwise great beer. Points for ambition.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

This is the newest release from Furthermore.  I just now got around to rating it - it actually has been out for a few months now.  Im not sure if this will be a seasonal or a year round release.  Either way it is not too bad.  While not the best in style it is reasonably well done.  I hope Furthermore can stick around long enough to expand their releases even more.
Aroma / Appearance - A deep brown almost black body reminded me of a flat Pepsi.  On top was a tan colored head with little lacing.  The nose was well done.  A base of roasted malts was complimented with smoke, peat, raspberries, coconut and chocolate shavings.
Flavor / Palate - There were no suprises in the first sip.  Smoke, malt, peat and a trace of watermelon rind form the initial impression.  The next couple of sips remind me of vanilla ice cream covered with some Hersheys chocolate syrup.  Towards the end it takes on an oaty character.  The mouthfeel is a little thin but not too bad for the style.  The earthy aftertaste is a little unusual but hardly a turnoff.  This is a solid well made beer which will hopefully survive in the Wisconsin beer landscape.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

An enormous billowy dark tan head forms above the translucent black walnut body, large bubbles breaking up audibly as the foam descends slowly leaving thick lacing; gorgeous.....light grapy notes are evident upon the cap being popped, but closer nosings show a much more typical bitter cocoa/espresso bean aroma, with fine hints of baked pecans as well; very expressive and well-developed.....doesnt hold up in the body, though its not bad overall, lightly sweet at the front with cocoa, vanilla and a bit of maple, drying out fairly quickly and becoming rather intensely bitter at the very finish....the problem is in the mouthfeel, at once rather thin and watery, and cardboardy towards the end....a little bit of finishing lactic sourness doesnt help either, spoiling an excellent beginning and making this just ""good"" rather than excellent.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
