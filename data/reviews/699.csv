699,"2014-09-30",4.2,"Pours a deep dark hue that turns out to be kind of a deep chestnut mahogany, thats consideraly more ruby when held up to the light.. Small creamy tan head, dissipates fairly quickly, but enough sticks around to coat the top of the liquid, though not the glass itself. 
Aroma is primarily boozy dark fruits. Raisins and bourbon. Some smokey peat, some sweet fruits, a lot of rich languid colours.
Taste takes all the promise of the aroma: the dark fruits, the boozy, peaty, scotchiness, and makes it dangerously smoothe. 9.2 is almost uncannily well hidden. The taste is quite sweet and creamy, with less of the bitter finish commonly found in the style. Brown sugar, peat, boozy raisins, smoothe vanilla... actually exceeds my expectations, and I was optimistic about this one. Unbelievably smoothe.","Seattle, Washington, USA","kemoarps"

Appearance : Dark amber.

Overall : I really enjoyed this one. Not too heavy for a scotch ale. Nice balance between caramel and wood. Nice intentse caramel on the finish while being rather dry and not heavy. Very enjoyable.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
699,"2011-03-31",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Elegant oak adds complexity to this Wee Heavys berry-laced caramel malts. This is not one of those over-the-top barrel-aging jobs; kudos to Silver City for being parsimonious. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the brownish dark red.
-The caramel finish could be longer for my tastes.
-The body is quite lean for the style; this increases drinkability, but then again some looking for a rich Scotch-style Ale are not going to be completely satisfied with this one. This is drier than most Quebec examples...
-Hops add a touch of bitterness in the finish, but they barely succeed in making an appearance.

699,"2011-03-05",3.2,"22oz bottle from Bottlworks. Pours a cola reddish brown with tan head that reduces quickly to a thin ring. Aroma is woody caramel malt. Taste is underwhelming...the oaky woodiness combined with the caramel malt combines to form a flavour best described as egg-salad like. Crazy and weird and Im fully aware Im cutting against the grain of the high ratings this beer generally gets...but it aint working for me. These two very dominant flavours just do not work together, they are in opposition. Maybe its my general dislike of American Oak (hate it in Chardonnay as well). At least the finish is better, slightly boozy but more refined with lingering vanilla and sweet caramel...the woodiness is less apparent in the end which is merciful.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","manuchampions"

In long: The nose is pretty light for a BA scotch ale, mainly wood barrel and vanilla.  Tate has a lot of barley candy, a lot of caramel, a lot of vanilla, a lot of wood, some dried cherries, some maple.  My first glass was a clear ruby and I though the beer was a rather bland.

This one is super-dangerous because I can drink it so fast and barely can restrain myself from just downing great gulps of its lovely caramelly oaked goodness.

699,"2009-09-07",4.1,"Bottle, with many thanks once again to bitbucket. Shared with Cole and Macadem. Nose is fantastic, big sweet bourbon, the best oak-aged beer Ive had since Bourbon County Stout, plus sweet dark fruit, raisins, caramel, dark toffee, molasses. Palate is huge and smooth, lovely bourbon accents on a nice fruity scotch ale base. Unlike many bourbon-aged beers Ive had, the wood complements rather than overwhelms. No sign of alcohol, an absolute delight!","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"

Poured a clear dark brown color with a moderate fizzy brown head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Medium toasted malt, wood and earthy scotch aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy bourbon sweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration.

A smooth complex drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
699,"2009-08-28",3.3,"bottle from a trade....did not take accurate notes on this one but thoughts are very similar to that of mikes below me.  very little barrel coming through in either the aroma or flavor.  an abundance of dark fruit, caramel, and a little vanilla.  average mouthfeel at best....surprised to see such high marks for this brew. hmmmm.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
699,"2009-08-22",2.8,"Bottle and served in a snifter: Murky reddish brown with a initial large fizzy head but fades to a small ring of bubbles and left little lace. The aroma has notes of rich toffee and vanilla malts, marzipan, faint woody smoke, herbal grassiness and some dark fruits. The taste is surprisingly muddled with some dark fruits upfront and a layer of discombobulated sweet malts. This Scotch Ale has neither the pungent kick in the arse of peat or iodine... nor the bite of smoky scotch whisky. It simply just lays flat against the palate, too much vanilla and caramel overtones... Perhaps I got a bad bottle or maybe it is just me tonight but I found this to be one highly overrated beer. Sorry Jon.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

699,"2009-04-28",4.1,"22oz bomber courtesy of SirChugsAlot poured into a tulip.

Pours a dark clear copper with a small off-white head that recedes very quickly to a small collar and leaves little lacing.

Aroma is very sweet with both the caramel malts of the underlying scotch ale and tons of vanilla from the barrel.  There is also plenty of dark fruits and the bourbon is there as well, maybe even some bananas.

The taste is a slight step up from the aroma as it isnt overly sweet.  It does start with the dark fruit and caramel malt sweetness with some figs and raisins, but the finish really brings out the barrel - vanilla and booze.

The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth with the barrel really softening the carbonation and overall mouthfeel.

This is a great Scotch ale that the barrel has really mellowed out and made into an extremely smooth and tasty brew.  Wonderful beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Aroma has quite a bit of oak, offsetting the sweetness of the dark and caramel malts - only a bit of hop character shows. This ones delicious. Definitely oaked, but the wood doesnt dominate, it accentuates. Lots of lightly roasted malts, a cola note, a bit of vanilla, and I actually get more bourbon than scotch. Id never guess it was 9.2% - this is very smooth, and very, very drinkable. Im continuously impressed with the folks at Silver City, and this is no exception.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
699,"2009-03-08",3.6,"Beautiful and rich scotch-colored body with only a ring of head. As advertised, a soft oak-wood nose and also light malting mixing to present a sawdust sweetness. Rich-full body that undulates over the tongue and palate with heavy viscosity. Deep, rich, Golden Promise grains, a ripple of sch\otch whiskey and light barrel woodiness. I am not the biggest fan of oak flavors in beers or wine, yet here, it is tempered and adds just a pleasant rustic woodiness, not the full blown bomb of oak flavors. Mild peatiness integrated throughout the beer as it airs and a hint of scotch nuttiness. Complex and exceptionally palatable for such an immense beer. More oakiness does breath out of the beer towards the end of the glass.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

699,"2009-02-09",3.8,"22oz from riversideAK - thanks, Alex! Very soft and inviting nose, a terrifically mellow bourbon aroma that is very welcome considering the harshness of all too many barrel-aged novelties. Not having had the base beer, I can sense that its a well rounded Scotch with malts that arent too treacly and enough peat and smoke to give it the character I dig. The wood lends a pleasant vanilla to the beer that makes it so smooth and silky. I am really enjoying this complex beer. Docked a couple ticks only because its too thin in appearance and palate.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Appears a slightly hazy, dark amber with a small, off-white head that slowly fades into a mild cap.  Scattered lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of vanilla, caramel, light smoked peat, toffee, oak, roasted nuts, raisins, and cream.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas.  I think the Fat Bastard wouldve faired better if I hadnt had it next to the Fat Woody.  This one was more rounded and certainly more complex.
Mouthfeel is smooth, semi-sweet of caramel with compliments of the oaky vanilla kicking in.

The overall aromas of the regular were on the softer and subtle side. They both shared tastes of nuts, caramel, and earthiness. The BA also had wood, vanilla, smoke, and citrus.
