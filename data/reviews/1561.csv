>> Clear pour, colorless. Fresh grass nose, flowers, green plant, aloe pulp. Taste is lightly sweet but more alcohol presence than the others sampled tonight. More rice and raw grain/starch, restrained alcohol as it warms, no harsh bite. Mouthfeel is more mellowed, as if it were aged,,,good density, higher body for sake that Ive tried. Soft finish, good body.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

1561,"2014-01-04",3.9,"Pours clear. Smells of sweet melon, moderate booziness, some strawberry undertones. Wonderful nose. Tastes on the sightly sweet/boozy end of the spectrum with some subtle, light fruity undertones on the finish. Very boozy at the end. Enjoyable.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1561,"2013-12-15",4.0,"Chobei has aromas of low-acidic fruits like honeydew, ripe pear, a hint of banana and faint anise. Kinda reminds me of Wrigleys Juicyfruit, but I havent had any in a while so I could be wrong.

Appearance is crystal clear; a swirl exposes nice legs.

It tastes like it smells with a little more heat from the alcohol than I expected and it is semi-dry. I get a hint of milk chocolate (but my co-tasters disagree). The texture is nice and thick; almost oily. Moderate complexity. The finish is medium-long and dry.

Overall, an excellent value Daiginjo.","","Takemasta"
1561,"2013-11-18",3.5,"Bottled, at Hotel Mulia, Senayan, Jakarta, Indonesia.  Pale yellow, somewhat viscous. Fruity aniseed aroma. Mid sweet with medium body and oily mouthfeel. Dough, milk chocolate, honey and white pepper. Licorice in a finish with some heat.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1561,"2013-07-18",3.7,"From a Cardboard box: Served in a porcelin cup. Mention of 14.5%ABV.
Clear as water (as it looked from the darkened porcelin cup).
Aroma is a nice rice and grainy mix with some cream and dust, liquor/alcohol and a bit of a nail polish remover touch to it, just a tiny teeny bit.
The flavour was really soft. Nothing extraordinary, but a well balanced real rice tasting drink.
Very soft and smooth, rice set the tone, some yeast/dust, cream, oily, slight hint of alcohol, and the slightest tone of nail polish removal (specially in the aroma and way less in the flavour).
No carbo, soft creamy oily texture, medium to lightly fuller bodied and a oily texture.
Very nice and smooth!","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"
1561,"2013-04-07",3.3,"Clear pour with hint of yellow. Yeast, rice fruity aroma. Dry, yeasty, banana taste with dry finish.

1561,"2010-06-19",4.0,"Bottle at Hachis Kitchen in Chicago. Pours very clear with maybe a hint of fog at the edge. The nose is clean with notes of rose and honeydew, clean white rice. No alcohol is apparent in the nose. There is a slight musty note, I assume that to be the koji. On taste, very full body with more of the floral and fruit notes. Cherry blossom and more melon and cucumber. Light alcohol notes that make you think they are going to push it over the edge but dont. Clean finish that sits with more melon. Pretty fantastic stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

1561,"2007-11-01",2.7,"Imagine my surprise finding a Daiginjo in a One Cup style! Not sure what to make of this one, not much aroma, alcohol, some koji & almonds. Has a slight sweetness up front but finishes with an interesting dry buttery feel. Better than any other cup sake Ive had but not even close to the Ji-zake Ive come to love.Earlier Rating: 12/17/2006 Total Score: 3.2Clear colorless sake. Koji, fruit and a mild alcohol scent, a lightly scented sake, not overpowering. A mild sweetness up front with koji and almonds followed by a cedary alcohol as it warms in the mouth. Light body, the added alcohol is evident but not unpleasant. For those that appreciate simplicity, you would appreciate the delicate subtle flavors. Not bad, just doesnt knock my socks off.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
1561,"2007-09-20",3.9,"Glass @ ""Asian Pillow"" near Kabukicho - Clear color, nice legs, some fruity pear and anise notes along with the usual kome and light ripe koji. The flavor is smooth, lightly buttery with a general smooth and puffy mouthfeel. Finishes clean and floral. Light impact and long tail. Excellent.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1561,"2007-09-15",4.1,"Mine came in a blue bottle and just read ""dai ginjo"" -- not sure if it was the same thing. One of the most pleasant sakes Ive had. Pured clear with no haze. Seemingly very light bodied. Most apparent are pine aromas probably from the pine box. Subtle fruit aromas of honeydew. Little to no detectable alcohol despite the bottle reading 16%. Little bite r after taste even when taken in a large gulp.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
1561,"2007-09-13",2.8,"My bottle was listed as ""Ozeki Daiginjo"" on the menu and was in Japanese lettering, so I dont know what it was called. I drank it on 8/25/07 at Fugakyu.Clear with moderate legs, moderate retention.  No chill haze.Some fruit and nuts in the nose (nectarines, almonds) are somewhat delicate, but that pesky coconut note is right there with it, as is an amount of alcohol vapor that seems far more apparent here than in the only other Daiginjo Ive had.  Medium strength of aroma, just not really crisp, heady or elegant.  Weighed down by too much alcohol and bland rice and coconut notes.Melons, coconuts and light butteriness are all apparent in the background.  Alcohol is not terribly pervasive in the flavor, and there are some fruit notes that are pleasant, but its just no match for others in its class and even some ginjos that Ive had.  Medium-dry, with a bit too strong of a texture (nutty, rice-hull blandness), IMHO.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1561,"2007-03-11",4.0,"A cool, refreshing sake, with a spicy aroma, full-bodied, sweet, fruity taste.  Balanced with a medium finish.  Very accessible, not highly complex.","USA","ldr514"
1561,"2006-08-22",4.1,"Pours crystal clear.  As I tilt the glass and pull back it leaves a defined residual deposit of nectar called ""legs"" around the side of the glass. The nectar sits there suspended and then finally starts to drip. This is indicitive of the weight of the nectar. For sake, this is about medium to full nectar weight. The aroma is clean and semi fruty with a slight fresh astringentcy. Fleshy flavors accompanied by butter are very delicate w/ a slight fruitiness. Finish is long and dry leaving a medium thick coat of butter on the palate. A well made sake.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
1561,"2006-01-18",3.0,"Tasted out of a cup, chilled.  Fully clear. Stale nut oil, faint rosewater, spike of grapefruit peel, but always returning to this sharp, oily nose of leftover nutmix. Soft sweetish taste, only vague flavour reminiscencies, every sip going into a sharp alcoholtaste. Hints of flavours as from Thai-typed perfumed rice. Retronasal  flowery aromas, and some nutty ones. Imagine sweet pistacchios? Serious alcoholburn, very smooth, oily texture. Very strange effluence of aromas and flavours. The first stale nuts impression is a knock-off, but in the taste, all components blend much more harmoniously together. Just something Im not used to... I try, being admonished by Bück Dich to be humble towards the efforts of the sake Braumeisters. One question, however. Is sake prone to lightstroke? The bottle is even worse in reality as on the picture...Earlier Rating: 6/27/2005 Total Score: 3.3 The Belgian importer calls this OZEKI CHO TOKUSEN DAIGINJO  [Transparent, drunk from a cup.] As more or less expected, sherry nose. However, this is the first sake tasted that smells of GOOD sherry, instead of watered-down second rate sherry. Also a nose of ripe pears (Nashi?) and a bit of lytchee fruit. Rather sweet, fruity taste, which reminds me again of lytchee sap, watered down. The sherry connection is all but gone, except for every new sip when a wood-fermented sherry aroma leaps up. Creeping up, but gradually very apparent alcoholwarming. Warming up, the aftertaste becomes true liquorice. Drank this chilled, as the website allowed me, and respectfully from a low cup. Meanwhile, Im very well aware all but the crudest of distinctions in sake are still escaping me. I used to think of this drink as poor quality, diluted sherry served lukewarm to add to the horror...","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
