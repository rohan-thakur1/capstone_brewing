3110,"2016-04-19",3.8,"Sample at Brass Tap Polaris. Dark brown pour with a medium foamy beige head that recedes steadily to a film. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of smoked malt, chocolate and coffee. Light to medium body with flavors of charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, bacon and coffee. The finish is roasty with a burnt malt aftertaste. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
3110,"2016-04-09",3.0,"Location: Sample on tap at Brass Tap Polaris
Appearance: Inky black with a thin head of medium sized off white bubbles
Nose: fairly decent hardwood smoke. Present but not overpowering. Darker toasted malt notes. 
Taste: Different. Unctuous and a bit oily. Definite smoke. There was an odd aspect that reminded me of smoked salmon. Solid medium to darker malt. Just a bit of hops at the back. decent bitters.
Body: Medium fluid.
Parting thoughts: the connection with smoked salmon is one that will linger. Its not bad, its just really strange.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
3110,"2016-02-07",3.9,"On tap at Mad Mex Robinson. Awesome smoked beer. Aroma was nice and strongly smokey. Campfire ash and bacon. Pour was a deep dark brown/near black with a thin tan film for a head. Taste was as the aroma suggested. Big smoke character with roasted malt and coffee finishing up the sip. Bacon and ash in the finish. One of the better smoked beers out there. Nice carbonation and very well done","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
3110,"2015-08-03",3.9,"At the brewery in Portland, pours a pitch black pour with a beige head. Nose is smoky bacon. Taste is pure smokey BBQ with bacon. Finish is dry, moderately long and ends on the intense smokey bacon notes. Nice !

3110,"2014-01-19",2.2,"On tap at the bocktown monaca. Yes, slight smoked bacon arom abut is that coming from the kitchen? Fairly dark. Almost black but it seems to be dark brown upon closer inspection. Smoked flavors from the start. Certainly a good example of its style. A little uneasy at times. Seems like the smoke was almost artificially added but Im no expert, go figger. As with most smoked brews, quite one smokey sided. Bacon fried smoked bacon. Not impressed by this style but there ya have it.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
3110,"2014-01-19",3.5,"On draft. Aroma of licorice. Flavors of smoky chocolate with some nuts behind them. Finished with a coffee like bitterness. Vaguely sticky on the palate. No trace of 9%. Probably under-rauched, still fantastic.","","TylerGreenDC"
3110,"2014-01-11",3.9,"On tap at Whole foods in Cranberry. Dark brownl but not too oily. This beer is noted for its cedar smoke notes. Almost a rauch beer but not as sweet..","Wexford, Pennsylvania, USA","kassner"

3110,"2013-05-11",3.5,"10oz on tap at Allyns Cafe, for $6. Black color. Nice lumpy light brown head. Medium body. Soft kind of stronger carbonation. More dry in the finish. Nice, thick lace. Good big smoke aroma. Its definitely pronounced and noticeable smoke, the way I like it. Nice chocolate, toasty malts. More sweet taste, overall. Lighter bitter. Solid, satisfyingly smokey smoked porter. Would love to try the imperial version.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3110,"2013-05-10",3.7,"Tap. Poured a dark brown color with an average frothy tan head that was mostly lasting and good lacing. Medium to heavy roasted malt, smoke wet wood aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy smoke sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Solid beer that would go well with spicy food or cigar.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3110,"2013-05-08",3.7,"Draft to taster. Looks good; cola with foamy beige head that dissipates into lacing. Smells solid; dark malt and smoke with a bit of roast too. Tastes like it smells with some smoked ham notes. Pleasant on the palate. A good smoked porter.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3110,"2013-05-05",3.7,"On tap at BRGR in Cranberry, PA. First attempt at Fat Heads, and even though it wasn't the Fat Heads brew I ordered (very loud restaurant and/or ignorant bartender), I was not disappointed. They are not kidding when they call this beer ""Up in Smoke"" because you know how smoky the flavor is going to be as soon as you get a whiff. Still, it is not overwhelming and is surprisingly drinkable.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","Sperine"
3110,"2012-10-19",4.3,"Had this at the 2012 Great American Beer Fest in Denver, Colorado. Smells like a mesquite BBQ pit, taste is rather on the light side of meat and has a decent body.","Farmington, Minnesota, USA","XmnwildX12"

3110,"2012-10-02",2.6,"This poured a medium brown color with a beige head.  Aroma was heavy smoke, roasted malts, light meat, and some light grassy hops.  Flavor was pretty much all smoke, but not meaty smoke, more like burnt rubber and plastic bandaid smoke.  Just not a big fan of these type of smoked beers and had trouble finishing this one.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
3110,"2012-10-02",3.4,"On tap at FH CLE 30Sept2012, More porter than smoked, the smoke comes in on the end and leaves a nice lingering campfire roast which compliments the roasted bitter chocolates, more porter than smoke, perhaps a good introductory smoked.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","jmikolich"
3110,"2012-09-10",4.4,"Aroma: Chocolate and caramel malts with a slight hint of smokiness at the edges.
Appearance: Black with tan head that dissipates quickly.
Taste:  Light smokey flavor that lingers and grows in intensity, but is balanced by a light sweetness and a light bitterness.
Palate: Full body, oily texture, soft carbonation, long smokey finish.
Overall: The smoke is readily apparent, but not so overwhelming that it tastes like drinking a used ash tray. This is a really well balanced beer, playing the flavors of the beer off the flavors of the smoke, and creating a nice, invitingly warm package.","Ohio, USA","pottygok"
3110,"2011-08-15",3.4,"Draft at Great Taste. Pours a deep brown/black with a tan head that sticks around. Nose is really earthy, some light campfire notes and cocoa dominate. No discernible hop aromatics. Upon tasting, it has more of that earthiness, faint campfire and cocoa. Clean and dry bitterness to balance. Finish is dry overall. Not bad, just seems to be lacking in a few different places. Okay.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3110,"2011-08-14",3.5,"Draft on tap at Great Taste of the Midwest 2011 (Madison, WI). Pours a murky brownish pour with a nice murky brownish pour, well hazed with nice frothy light brown head, laces ok, stays as a thicker film. Aromas are roasty and toffee, toast, and smoked malts. A touch of florals and grass. Some cocoa, coffee, roasted smoke, ash, earth. Some sweeter toffee, caramel, toast. Backend lingering smoke, dryness, ash, earth, and some hops. Finish leaves a lingering dryness and smoke. Nice, but a bit underdone.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3110,"2011-06-29",3.6,"Black with brown edges and a beige cover.  The aroma is mostly just roasted malt, some hints of cocoa.  Taste presents slightly more woody smoke, but it is still hidden under a dominant roast body.","Capital of Appalachia, Pennsylvania, USA","lithy"
3110,"2010-09-12",3.7,"Growler shared by John, thanks! Poured black with a brown head that lasted throughout the beer. Aroma was quite smokey with a note of bacon, chocolate and a good amount of roasted malt. Flavor began with roasted malt with growing smokiness and some backing bacon and chocolate. Surprisingly smooth on the tongue.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

3110,"2010-04-17",4.1,"Growler sent by MikeTD, you rock!  Pours a black bruin body with a yellow off white head.  Huge bacon notes (minus the salt), really smokey body, smoked malt, rauch, peat and some campfire tones.  Liquid smoke, wow what a smoky bastard caused me to pull out some salmon, just decadent for a smoke beer, hardly find any of these.  ABV feels really tame, they could have brewed at a higher gravity this would totally mask it.  A fantastic smoked beer.  Love it.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
3110,"2010-04-06",3.3,"Growler brought back by a friend. Nice to get to try the only OH beer to score a medal at last years GABF. Pours clear brown with a huge beige head. Malty aroma with firewood and ham notes. Smoky ham flavor with a bitter coffee finish and a hammy aftertaste. Not bad, but the smoke was a bit too much. It really masked the other notes and flavors that (Im assuming) were in there.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
3110,"2010-03-15",3.4,"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub in a sampling glass.  The beer pours a deep opaque brown color, with a mild tan head.  The nose brings very strong smokey character, resembling the rauchbiers of Germany.  While the aroma isnt displeasing, Im not sure it reflects the subtle smokey character that is present in the best examples of the style.  This strong note transfers to the palate, lending a flavor that is so strong, it almost resembles licking a grill grate.  I like this flavor, but Im not sure that it isnt overly aggressive.  Other flavors are clearly present (especially roasted character), but they are vastly overshadowed by the rauch malts flavor.  The palate itself is not overly sweet, and otherwise shows skillful brewing.  Smokey notes linger on the palate for several moments.  Overall, an aggressive, if unique effort.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"
3110,"2009-10-27",4.1,"Tap @ Transit Pizza Plant.  Very dark brown body, a bit of mahogany light shines through.  Tan head that fades relatively quickly.  Nose is peaty, oily smoke, rich roasty sweet malt, a little bit of hop.  Flavor is smoke, peat, rich roasty malt, a little milkiness.  Hop presence is a bit higher than Id like but not overwhelming.  Roasty finish w. a big smoke character - campfire & some peat.  Roasty goodness.  An awesome smoked porter - I see why this won silver at GABF.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
3110,"2009-10-26",3.8,"Good smoked enjoyed on-tap at Pizza Plant, Transit. Black body with soapy brown head, served too cold.  More drinkable though not more complex as it warmed, yielding more coffee..  Pleasant BBQ smoke in nose. Above average mouthfeel, a sipper but drninkable. Drying finish.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
3110,"2009-10-05",3.6,"Growler Pours black with a mid-sized, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. The aroma is of chocolate and smoked cheese and meat. Medium-bodied with gentle carbonation. The flavor is a touch smoky, but mostly balanced and acrid, like gun smoke. Moderately bitter, bone-dry finish. Thanks to TheCheeseMan and miketd for sharing their wealth!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
