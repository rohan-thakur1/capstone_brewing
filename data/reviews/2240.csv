2240,"2017-06-15",3.1,"Dark copper colour with an average-sized firm white head. Some lacing. Surprisingly weak aroma shows dough, sugar and a vague hint of tart fruitiness. Luckily more bright in the taste with a very sweet caramel and sugary base, a mild, delicate touch of refreshing sourness bringing balance and hints of cherry fruitiness. Not too rich but pleasantly refreshing. Light bodied with average, soft carbonation, easy and highly drinkable. Overall a light-feeling, quite refreshing, mostly sweet and slightly sour beer. Ok, but not very interesting.","ITALY","ozzatoadisback"

2240,"2016-05-02",3.7,"First rating for the Faro style. Not that easy to find as RateBeer shows only 16 active examples of the style. 375 ml bottle purchased at Beverage Warehouse while on a business trip to Los Angeles some 19 months ago ($6.99). POURS a nice sun-brewed tea color, like a deep sunset orange/amber with two fingers of effervescent white foam. AROMA of a not-too-tart vinaigrette, some musty basement, wet oak, a bit of stewed dark fruits, and some red wine thats been sitting out for too long. FLAVOR of wine-y vinegar, nice berry / fruit touches (strawberry, raspberry, perhaps peach and apricot), mild brown sugar, simple syrup, with some bits of tart funk. I expected something more tart on the tongue, but the added brown sugar does come in to make this a less puckering affair. I wonder if the aging has decreased the sweet content.

Min 1125de rating, men endnu er der øltyper jeg ikke har læsket min gane i, og en af dem, er faro. Det bliver spændende at se, hvad der byder sig. Øllet er let tåget teaktræsfarvet og med et hvidt, boblende skum, der forsvinder hurtigt. Syrlig duft som forventet og underligt nok en smule champignon og kælder/gær. Syrlig smag med en del røde bær og blommer, samt masser af sødme, og tidligere nævnte fugtige kælder. Rigtig lækker smag egentlig - og dejligt forfriskende - især da jeg havde frygtet noget geuze-lignende, som jeg bestemt ikke er begejstret for (i øvrigt den eneste øltype jeg bevidst går uden om, udover berliner weisse). Blød og tiltalende mundfølelse, der ikke er helt tynd.

Good looking for sure. The flavours are omnipresent, with lots of peach, grassy and lemon hops, ""stable"" yeaste and honey notes. These features make up for a heavy sweet and medium sour brew.

Pleasantly tart without a funky smell. The first sip is surprisingly sweet, almost artificial tasting. The intense sweetness reacts with, rather than balances, the natural tartness.

Let og knap så tydelig aroma af stikkelsbær og grapefrugt. Måske lidt kælder-aroma fra gærnuancerne og en umiskendelig lugt af noget gammelt og hengemt. 
Mørkerosa Lambic style: Faro med en minimum skumtop, som hurtigt svinder til kant og overflade. 
Første indtryk er en meget sød- og syrlig øl, men også med en vedhæftende bitterhed, der dog spiller en mindre rolle. Sødmen holder ved, omend det syrlige lægger spor på ens tænder. Smagsopsummering: Kraftig sødme, let syrlig og let bitter. 
Middel fyldig krop med en karbonering på et middel niveau. Klæbrig konsistens. Afslutningen er sødlig, let bitter, ganske kort og tør.

Not to funky and not too sour, its a surprisingly approachable beer.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

 Served on tap in a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a deep brownish cherry red color with a red tinted head. Upon serving there is a lighter tinted, almost cream, colored head floating atop the brew. The small head fades over about a 3 minute time frame leaving some light bits of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma was most potent of some aromas of a Belgian candied sugar and some darker fruits of cherry and raisin. Some more funky aromas were there as well, consisting of a hay like and grassy smells along with a old leathery and somewhat grainy and barnyard like smell, which when mixed with the sugar and fruit smells produced a rather weird smell overall.

 Taste  The taste begins with a sweet flavor with tons of Belgian candied sugar flavors and a little bit of a darker fruit taste. A lighter grainy taste as well as some sourness is present upfront both of which grow slightly stronger throughout the taste. While some sourness comes to the tongue, it remains relatively light, being largely overshadowed by the sweeter flavors. A little bit of a hay like taste and a bit of a funky and lactic acid taste also come to the tongue more toward the middle and the end. The mix of flavors that finishes up the taste ends up leaving a rather sugary sweet, but lightly sour and funked flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the medium side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. While the higher carbonation was fantastic for the sweet and sour flavors of the brew, a slightly thinner body may have been more appropriate for the sweeter and sour nature of the beers flavor. Even said though, the feel overall was still rather appropriate.

 Overall  Sweet and sugary with a lighter level of funk and sour. If looking for a sweeter and more sourbrew then this is a good go to, but for me it was a little too sugary to likely want on much occasion.","","Darkmagus82"

Malt dorge et de froment, candi et un édulcorant supplémentaire.
Le faro est une vieille bière régionale qui a eu son heure de gloire à la belle époque.
Couleur ambre foncé. Clarté nette. Bulles grosses par dizaines partout.
Mousse beige clair en nappage crémeux à 1mm.
Arômes de lambic, cerise noire, pointe de cassis et myrtille.
1ère bouche très douce sur une marmelade de fruits noirs et rouges, avec un fond aigre doux.
Arrière-bouche sucrée au candi, et des accents de malt et de fût.
2ème sur le fruit sucré et le malt caramel. Des parfums de chai un peu distants
et de premier niveau.
3ème sur des fruits confits, de la pâte de fruits, nuances de dattes fugaces.
La longueur est doucereuse, un peu mielleuse. Des relents de lambic, mais beaucoup de candi et sucre.
Lalcool est doux, il suit quasiment en spectateur ce breuvage !!
La finale ne ferait pas de mal à une mouche...
CONCLUSION : le faro est un genre ancien qui mérite que lon sy arrête, mais certainement pas que lon sy attarde... parce quil manque grandement de complexité.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

T - Starts off with lots of candied sugar sweetness slowly giving way to a mix of light fruit, dulled tartness, and even more sweetness. Some mineral like qualities creep in toward the end but the sweetness drowns them out quickly. The finish is, you guessed it, more sweetness with some light funk, lingering on the pallet for some time.

The taste is basically the same with a cherry aftertaste and dry finish.
The palate has a light to medium sort of body with a nice sessionable aspect to it. Carbonation is good for me, but this is my first faro so Im unsure if this is good for the style.

Appearance - the color is an amber color, sort of like a clear honey. The head is white, and from initial pour settles fast, and quickly becomes a thin 1/8"" slice of white head.
Taste - is a combination of initial sweetness, and a tart apple like transition
Palate - the body is light. The texture very thin. The carbonation on the tongue very fizzy, nice effervescence. The finish holds a nice sweet and sour on the tongue. Later in the experience there is a little must that shows up on the tongue.

Faro od Lindemansa było moim pierwszym starciem z lambikami. Wprawdzie kiedyś, bodajże w roku 2009 piłem jakiegoś krieka, jednak było to piwo ewidentnie dosłodzikowane, smakowało jak owocowa oranżada. Muszę przyznać, że przeżyłem spory szok, stajenne nuty w połączeniu z intensywną kwaśnością w pierwszej chwili skojarzyły mi się z wymiocinami i musiałem nieźle się skupić, żeby to skojarzenie ""pominąć"" w dalszej degustacji. Piwo nie przypadnie do gustu każdemu, jednak w mojej opinii warto poznać ten specyficzny bukiet wrażeń.

That gives way pretty quickly to full-on paper, vegetal and powdered sugar notes. Yum! Light amber-colored body is clear and reasonably retains the off-white head.Notes of strawberry rhubarb are heavy up front, leading to simple syrup and malt vinegar on the finish. There is a somewhat pleasant tartness in the mix, but its heavily, heavily outclassed by the candi sugar dominance and already poor base that is Lindemans (non-cuvee rene) gueuze.

Restrained carbonation...at least in lambic terms...some viscosity to it but still light bodied, appreciable acidity. 
Burnt toffee sweetness carries through the palate, Notes of dried fig, raisin and grainy malt along the way. Low bitterness to finish, still comes out somewhat sweet.

Appearance: Its dark in the glass with a bronzy amber colored body held up to light. It has good clarity and some visible carbonation. A good two finger head caps of the beer. Its off white in color and tightly packed. On the glass it leaves some spotty lace. 

Smell: There are notes of white bread, raw grain and wheat malt with a hint of sweetened whiskey or sweet brandy. 

Taste/Palate: It is candy sweet up front with notes of white bread, sweet caramel, and nougat. Some tangy wheat and yeast tartness just tries to sneak in as some fruit notes like sweet apple peach and pear lead into a stick sweet finish. The palate is medium bodied, smooth and slick. On the lips it feels sticky.

Funk is still evident when I take a closer sniff, but the caramel sweetness from the sugar comes to the fore. Upon tasting, the immediate sensation on the tongue is some acid and lemons. That disappears quickly though as my palate is then consumed by caramel and sugar. Mouthfeel is average and bubbly. Finish is sugary and tart. Pretty good beer.

Comments: I am glad my first Faro is a good one and has already got me hooked! Its aroma, taste and palate is very complex, intriguing, pleasant, and typical to the style.

The influence of the candy sugar can be felt moving into the mid-palate, which offers some sweetness along with some woody notes. The sour flavour and slight redcurrant notes reappear towards the finish, which is a deft balance between sour and sweet.

Aroma: The nose is sour yeast, some tart/sweet fruit, and some sugary notes

Appearance: It pours a clear dark orange color with a small beige head and no lace at all

Flavor: It is rather sweet and fruity, less tart then the nose, but there is a light underlying tartness

Palate: The body is fairly light, it feels mildly sticky, has a soft carbonation, and has a fairly lengthy finish

Very pleasant sweet aroma, like the golden nuggets breakfast cereal i had when I was a kid (that probably means theres some butterscotch). Clear bold rich orange, brief head. Full sweet palate, gentle carbonation. Sweat breakfast-cerealy honey-covered wheat-flake taste. Rather nice. Finish is mostly the sweetness, and to be honest, I shouldnt give this 4, but it was very nice in the mouth, so I have to. Overall, a remarkably drinkable modern faro, better than some of the more traditional ones Ive had, to be honest. However, thats because I think faro is intrinsically a modern sweet thing, not a traditional sour thing. If you want to stick sugars into your old lambics, then do them via the medium of young lambic, and give me a geueze. If, however, you want a luscious sweet drink, then make one of these.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Al paladar las sensaciones dulce predominan, sin embargo, posteriormente, las notas dulces ceden paso a un sabor ligeramente acido, caracteristico de este estilo de cervezas. El final de esta cerveza es amplio, y finalmente se deja sentir ciertos sabores frutales, principalmente a pera y manzana verde, aun que en ningún momento cede completamente el sabor dulce.
En general, una cerveza bastante buena y representativa del estilo.","Zapopan, Jalisco, MEXICO","emartell"

2240,"2012-03-15",3.4,"Picked this up at the Lebanon Health Food Store for $5.25. Poured into an Ommegang Glass at cellar temperature of 59 Degrees F.

A - The beer is a dark amber to brown color. Really beautiful. An easy pour generated 3-fingers of off white to leather colored head. It dissipated to a small line of bubbles after 5 minutes.

S - The standard Tart & Sour scent is what hits the nose first. This is followed by wheat and very bready yeast. It has a sort of ice cream scent like mint ice cream. Creamy and sugar along with cream. Very pleasant and not too over powering.

T - Yeah, its a very mild sweetness. The sweet and tart notes fade away almost instantly which is disappointing. The wheat taste is the dominant taste in this beer. Id prefer more sour from a Lindemans beer but its not terrible. 

M - 50/50 bubbles to liquid on a mouth swish. Lingering candy taste after swallowing. Light and drinkable.

O - This is a solid beer but not fantastic. The price wasnt too bad. As I finish this glass, the sweetness is starting to sit weird on the palate. If it was a bit more sour, the sweetness wouldnt be such a turn off.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

2240,"2012-02-22",3.1,"12 oz bottle. My first of the style, so cant do much comparisons here. This was actually rather as expected though, with it being mild on the funk, lighter on the body, and candy sugary sweet in flavor. It pours with a bright white layer of small bubble head, with a ring of retention, a transparent, honey-like golden-caramel color. The aroma is light and sugary with some unique qualities to it. Some olives, honey, caramel, cinnamon-like spice, and cheesy grass can be appreciated. The body starts out with a decent, sparkling carbonation with light oil and vinegar coming in to give a quite unique feel. Would definitely like more of the funk (which is quite minor) to take over and balance out the sugary sweetness that dominates. Honey and light sugary fig are prominent, giving it an almost mead-like quality. Cinnamon spice, caramel candy, green apples, tart pears, light vinegar, and minor toasty crackers in there as well as a light cheesiness.

2240,"2012-01-01",3.7,"Another first for the evening for me in the new year; a faro-style lambic!  LIndemans was again the brewery that benefited from my first taste of this style.  Their faro poured an amber color with rich and creamy beige head.  The head left some nice lacing at first, but not much after the first couple of sips.  The nose was really fruity and yeasty, with some cherries, blackberries, earth, leather and rye bread notes.  The mouthfeel was spritzy and well-carbonated.  The flavors were a nice combination of sweet, sour and tart, with some fruity notes of cherries and berries.  I also got some bitter and sour tones.

It smells of sour fruit, slightly rotten with a funk that will put a boys high school locker room to shame.  When I taste it, it does not live up to its sour expectations.  It is sour yet sweet at the same time.  The addition of candi sugar smooths it out here.  In fact, this is sweeter than I would like it to be.

2240,"2011-10-20",3.3,"Reviewed 08-20-2010.  Pour is light and coppery, with a thin foamy white head that rapidly dissipates. Smell is classic lambic, very similar to the Cuvee Rene -- slight citric tartness, grassy notes, a little peach/apricot in the finish. Taste starts off with lactic tartness, accented by the ample carbonation, and gives way to a sweet starchy fruit flavor and a slightly funky finish. High carbonation and thin body make this almost soda-like. Drinkability is much higher than expected -- Im not typically a fan of the sweeter lambics, but the sweet/sour balance in this is spot-on and the sugar is not at all cloying or saccharine. I know itll never happen... but it would be pretty great to get this in cans for the summer.

My first and likely only (for awhile) faro. My assumption is that Lindemans pasteurizes it like their fruit beers, which would be the only way of stopping the flora from consuming the sugar and blowing up the bottle. Not a true faro, but Im glad to have tried it.","California, USA","jedwards"

Finish: dry yet sticky, malty and puckeringly tart with a nice sweet balance.   Notes: 	A sweet and sour sauce of a beer.  I know Faros are generally light on fruit, but there was some definite fruit characteristics here; maybe from the wild yeast?  Either way, I really dug it in a weird kind of way.

Appearance: Its dark in the glass with a bronzy amber colored body held up to light. It has good clarity and some visible carbonation. A good two finger head caps of the beer. Its off white in color and tightly packed. On the glass it leaves some spotty lace.

Smell: There are notes of white bread, raw grain and wheat malt with a hint of sweetened whiskey or sweet brandy.

Taste/Palate: It is candy sweet up front with notes of white bread, sweet caramel, and nougat. Some tangy wheat and yeast tartness just tries to sneak in as some fruit notes like sweet apple peach and pear lead into a stick sweet finish. The palate is medium bodied, smooth and slick. On the lips it feels sticky.

The Chapeau has this one beat in looks, just slightly, the actual beer here looks better it is a clear brownish red, they head is a bit weaker though.

Take the funk of the chapeau and throw it out the window with this one, I like this one better too. It is slightly tart smelling with a nice lemon smell to it, very much like a lighter version of the gueuze, there is some barnyard but it lingers waaay, waay in the background.

This one is much crisper than the other, it is overly sweet, but Im assuming that the sweetness is somewhat par for the course. The lambic flavors are there, but simply with a dose of straight up sugar.

Id say colder is better to enjoy this one, it isnt bad, but it is really really sweet.

APPEARANCE: Pours deep orange amber. White head is about 1 finger with medium duration. When head settles, it leaves nice layer of film on surface. 
AROMA: Lambic, molasses, tart fruit, grain, hay. Faint hint of chalk on nose as well. 
TASTE: Brown sugar throughout. 
Front of palate is brown sugar, molasses, some candy-like apple.
Mid palate is abundance of tart taste. In particular, notes of tart green apple and tart cherry.
Back of palate is tart with faint grainy dryness. 
Finish is complex interplay of sweet, somewhat dry, and tart; with most emphasis on the tart character. 
MOUTH FEEL: Lively carbonation. Crisp. Semi-dry. Highly quaffable. 
OVERALL: My first faro. Interesting. Complex interplay of sweet and tart. Starts sweet and progresses towards tart. Better suited as a session ale sipped during the daytime, ideally at a cafe. Molasses notes would allow this faro to pair well with bacon (i.e., during brunch, etc.). Another reason this beer would be suitable for brunch is that it could substitute for a mimosa during the meal because of its slightly acidic yet sweet nature. In fact, if I were to exaggerate, would say this faro is like a mimosa with a little maple syrup mixed throughout - though in a very delightful way.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

4.0 S: Strange, but nice. Lots and lots of candi sugar. Huge sweetness. However, theres a good bit of saison-like barnyard funkiness to balance. Wild apple fruitiness. A touch of tart acidity.

3.5 T: Good taste, but the candi sugar is present in far too high a level. I can deal with this amount of sweetness in some of Lindemans other brews because there is usually a strong enough sourness to balance. This, however, is a couple level of tartness lower, than say, the Kriek. Barnyard funkiness is there again as well as the wild apple, but everything plays second fiddle to the sweetness.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good spritzy carbonation. Fairly creamy. Not all that smooth due to the massive amounts of sugar.

A- Body is a completely transparent slightly dark caramel hue. Pours with <1/2 finger foamy white head that eventually fades to a thin collar with no lacing left behind in the glass.

S- Nose is of moderate strength and offers a good bit of funk-cheesecloth, a hint of vinegar, and a sugary sweetness-that seems to be more of regular sweetness than belgian candi sugar

T-Taste is much stronger than the smell. The initial flavor of of juicy white grapes, a very mild accent of vinegar, and a hint of cheese. The finish adds a lot of sweetness-almost cloyingly so- to the flavors already described. What lingers is a mild combination of everything described.

M- medium to high clarbonation and a medium weight quite juicy body initially with a slightly dry finish.

D- This is an interesting brew overall. My first of the style-and I dont really depend on Lindemans to demonstrate the best example-but I have a good idea of what its about. The flavor profile is slightly gueze-like but has a much lighter character and is much sweeter.

Nose is dusty and sour and very tart - high expectations!  Looks are a little hard to determine in this light, but certainly clear orange leaning toward red with pink highlights, firm and persistent carbonation, and an extremely active and noisy head that both far outstrips and outlasts non-alcoholic carbonated beverages.  Seriously, the duration and volume of head activity are impressive.  Taste is sweet, almost cloyingly so, dries out only slightly (enough to be drinkable) and lets some wheat leech through.  Has a nice little bit of grainy grit, but really not all that sour or tart, those qualities are doubtless more than tempered by the sweetness.  No alcohol coming through, and just a hint of bitterness and yeast.  This is an enormously drinkable lambic, moreso than most lambics Ive had, which tend to fit that bill for me.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Corked and capped. Poured a medium to dark, orangey copper with a large, off-white head that mostly diminished and left left excellent lacing. The aroma had apple cider; moderate barnyard, cheese, cobwebs and dusty yeast; grape, apple and champagne. The initial flavor was sweet, slightly sour and ever so slightly acidic; while the finish was slightly sweet, sour and slightly acidic. There was apple, grape, champagne, sugar water, dusty yeast and sour fruit. The light to medium body was very dry with fairly soft carbonation and a chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Aroma: I know this is going to sound odd, but it smells like the inside of someones shoe mixed with candy sugar. 
Appearance: It pours an amber-brown color with a thin white head. Lesser head retention. 
Taste: The best way I can describe this one is to say it tastes like a packet of the sweet and sour sauce you get with your Chinese takeout.  There is a little apple cider, perhaps a touch of orange peel, and a definite sweetness. 
Palate: Light to medium body with average carbonation leading to a lingering sweet finish. 
Overall: Well, I can say I have this category ticked off, but I cant say this brew is one I would go back too.  Its not bad, its just not my style.  If you havent had a Faro, this may be your only shot if you live in the states.  Go get it you ticker.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

2240,"2010-09-21",3.1,"330 ml bottle corked and capped. This past weekend  I went to an estate sale in town where a woman donated her house and belongings to her church.  I got there a bit after it had started, but it was still a gold mine.  In addition to the fine books on botanical gardens, orchids etc I picked up, I found a lovely old blown glass decanter and six etched wine trumpet glasses from the early 1900s.  I am drinking a toast to this woman now out of her wine glass.  Hope she enjoyed the angels share as much as I did.   Intriguing acrid nose lingers slowly from glass and makes one initially wonder...""what the heck is this stuff?...Oh yes...wild yeast""   Pours a dark amber with a steady yet thin central column of carbonation. I wonder if it is past its prime since the description states a ""red"". First taste is sweet...as much of the Lindemans line tends to be...nearly over sweet.

The palate shows both of the items, with a propensity toward sourness in the approach and mid-palate, and some residual sweetness toward the finish.  Carbonation is surprisingly assertive, but exactly what the flavors seem to want.  Hops are not detectable.  The finish is lightly sour and subtly malty.

2240,"2010-08-22",3.3,"This is my first lambic that I am rating on this site.  It is also one of the rarest lambic styles I have been told.  Had a pop up cap with a cork as well.  Silly to be sealed twice I think.   Label on bottle is fairly fancy.  I like it.  Pours an orangeish brown color with a medium sized off white head.  Is pretty fizzy.  Smells of sugary goodness mixed with some sort of fruit (pear? cherry?).  Has a nice look to it.  Taste is very sweet, almost like sugar.  Little bit of carbonation in their with some plums in the taste.  Wasnt sure what to expect with the lambic.  A little sweeter than I expected but not a bad drink.  Oh and purchased by my boy scotty bo botty.  Holler.","Maryland, USA","arone12"
2240,"2010-08-21",3.3,"Capped & corked bottle from Binnys beverage Depot in Orland Park, IL:  This poured a slightly hazed amber body with a modest head that rapidly dwindled to a film.  The aroma has a cherry candy sweetness with a light lemony tartness and a soft touch of funk.  The flavor was more balanced than the nose led me to expect, although the sweetness did dominate.  The finish was surprizingly dry with a lemon drop tartness.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
2240,"2010-08-20",3.4,"Finally got a hold of this elusive style, albeit a common brand. Earthy nose is sweet and enticing. Texture is tingly and full up front, dryish in the middle, sticky in the finish and cloying in the aftertaste. Unfermented Belgian candi sugar really comes through. Rich rock candy in the malts, with a distinct, honey-like and mead-like aspect that dominates from start to finish. Some flowers in the aromas, along with sweet petals and sugar-coated perfume-like essences. Has a curious nip of sourness that surfaces here and there, but it is washed away with sweetness. Extremely mild, almost non-existent hop bitterness. Interesting beer, especially for its mead-like qualities, but too sweet for me. I wont, however, rule out the style after just this one sample, especially due to the fact that its Lindemans, which brews a lot of sweet beers.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

Brett, Funk and Rubber on the nose initially. There is some light cherryish tartness there too. First drink: this is a fairly sweet beer, sugar is right up front, like kool-aid up front.

Taste is sweet with fruity notes, mainly grapes and cherries.  Taste is closer to a fruit lambic than to a gueuze.  A good amount of flavor, but not many yeast or sour tastes.  Finish is a little bit more dry than the beginning.  An interesting style, but I think i prefer gueuze and fruit lambics.","Maryland, USA","scottw86"
2240,"2010-08-14",3.5,"Ive been rating beers here since 2004, have rated over 5,100, and yet this is only the 2nd faro Ive ever had.  Thats kind of like the number of cycles hit for by Pete Rose.  Well, enough pointless statistics crap.  On to the review.  The pour is ruddy chill hazy liquid caramel copper color, mayhaps a bit toward the brown end of the visible light spectrum, with pretty much no head at all save a few frothy bubbles near the sides of the Stone Levitation tulip glass.  The nose is sour mashy malt, sugar syrup, lactic notes.  The flavor is nice, good complexity and sweet, like a much less fruity base example of the Lindemans lambics, but with more sweetness and a lot of sugar syrupy and  honey flavors.  Take the Lindemans process, remove the fruit, add a smattering of mead, and let the wild yeast fall where they may, and you end up with this, a very quaffable and unique beverage that defies traditional classification and stands quite nicely as a solid example of a style that is far too rare in the states.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

2240,"2010-07-22",3.6,"The pour is sparkling clear with a pale copper color, plenty of effervescence, and an average, fizzy, and white which diminishes quickly and leaves a thin fizz throughout but no lace.  The nose is pleasant with wet earth, light sour cherry notes, mushroom funk, wet oak, maybe some grapefruit peel, and a bit of candi sugar; odd not to have any barnyard or horse blanket notes?  The palate is lively to fizzy, light to medium, and quenching.  The flavor is similar to the nose with the mushroom funky notes becoming almost barnyardy but soon diminishing beneath the candi sweetness, wet oak, wet earth, and tart sour cherries; a quenching acidity but not overly so due to the sweetness of the candi sugar.  The finish is fairly long, sweet but still quenching, and noting wet oak, candi sugar, and tart cherries.  My first faro and I am surprised by how many differences there are between this and other lambics.  The balance of acidity and sweetness was nice but took away from some of the refreshing character.

Pours a dark rusty coppery red, brownish darker with good haziness, a small offwhite head that dies to a ring, laces pretty well. Decent overall, deep pretty color. Aromas are a combination of sour lactic acid, a decent acidity, barnyard funkiness, dust, hay, moving into wheat bread, crackers, a light sugary candy sugar does indeed poke through. Lighter on the sensory organs. Initial is fairly sweet, almost a light ginger beer type feel or  maybe a touch of raisins, sweet candi sugars mix with decent acidity and sourness, a touch of citrus, biscuits and bread with a decent funky bretty quality. A decent ""7-Up"" type quality. Quite interesting, too sweet for me as a ginger ale and light sourness sneak in, light funkiness. Lambic - Lite with a bit too much sugar for me. Stale bread and sugars linger, light tartness and funk are there. I still a bit confused as to why this style is made.. Essentially, flat Ginger Ale with a touch more tartness overall.

Aroma holds definite pure sugar, like the coating of a Sour Patch Kid sort of candy, but without the fruitiness. The sour tartness definitely comes through as well, along with an intriguing salty character and notes of prime rib. Totally weird nose. Flavor is, quite simply, a sweet lambic. Tartness fades, and is replaced by pronounced sweetness, and a hint of lemon. Palate is impressive considering the sugary flavor, and has a nice, dry, crisp body.

Not too shabby so far. The flavor is, well, Lindemans. Unnecessarily sweet. I understand it is sweetened intentionally, but man. Strong juicy sweetness hits the palate hard right off the bat. A fruity acidity that somewhat reminds me of cranberries tries in futility to combat the sweetness, as does a gentle leathery tone. Theres an interesting apple cider note toward the finish and even some distant sugar.

Basic vinegar, wild acidity, barnyard. Smells nice and tart. Im pretty excited since nearly all of the Lindemans lineup is pure soda. I mean, jeez, Linemans doing a style that actually requires the addition of sugar is enough to blast cavities into every one of my teeth. So, optimistically I take a sip and boy am I horrified. This is seriously sweet. How could my nose not detect this onslaught of sugar. Can we as humans not smell sucrose? Is my nose just that bad? Man, three more sips and Im cringing. This is pure soda.

Pours with a half-finger of of bubbly white head that disappeared really quickly; semi-clear amber color. Stinky (but a milder version of stinky) cheese aromas; earthy; semi-funky and a little tart; not very sour smelling and no acidity; some fruit sweetness in the aroma as well. Whoa; wasnt expecting how sweet this was. I understand that this is part of the style, and I have to admit this was my first Faro, but really not digging on this. Really sweet grapes and cherry flavors; and the funkiness of it is really overshadowed. Almost medicinal. A little sticky; lightish to medium MF; very muted carbonation. Not good drinking for me; way too sweet and the mix with the slight funk just didnt work out well for my palate. Definitely was hoping for more funk. Overall, I hate to review this poorly as it was my first attempt at the style, but I still cant help but think that the overwhelming sweetness might not be the entire intention of the style. Will have to seek out others to compare.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"

This gave a keen perception into the Lindemans line in general, as this truly seems to be the base for their other, now hugely popular fruited lambics, knowing that those beers are definitely sugared up as opposed to other truer style lambics.  That being said - I really enjoyed this!  Heavy in the sweet department, with touches of peaches and apples, a slight spice profile in the back end, and an ever so gentle sweep of sour throughout the body and lingering palate, this was definitely a pleasurable experience.

You can tell theres still a dry sensation from the oak affecting the mouthfeel, but its secondary.

A - Clear, and light tawny amber with some orange and red hues. Very thin light beige head with little retention and no lacing left over.

S - Funky, tart and sour make up most of the smell. Also has a bit of a sweet smell in the background. Reminds me a bit of an Oud Bruin only sweeter, the combination of the sour/tart and the funk.

T - Starts out with sour apple and lemon as well as tart cherry and raspberry taste. Then, quickly, the sweetness comes into play along with those taste. It goes from being a sour/tart beer to something more like a cider or a strong fruit juice. The sweetness also brings a bit more of a strawberry taste out. There is a slight funky background, but the yeast flavors are well covered.

M - Medium to light body with low carbonation. Slight puckering with a mouthwatering finish. Also a bit sticky/coating in the mouth.

D - Quite drinkable. Provides some tart and sour flavors, but they are very strong due to the sweetness. That sweetness and the coating mouthfeel might prevent drinkability, depending on your mood.

Notes: Pretty good beer. A little too sweet, especially with the coating/sticky feel, for me. However if I were in the mood for something sour and tart but didnt want it to be too sour and tart, this would really fit the bill. Nice mouthwatering and refreshing cycle goes with this. Not a bad beer, and definitely worth trying, and has a niche it fills. Also may be a good way to start people off on sours, since the sugar makes the sour taste less powerful.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a three-finger thick, tan colored head.  The beer is a rich amber hue with red-plum overtones to it.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear, amber-copper color.  The aroma smells of lightly oxidized apples, a touch of musty mushroom notes, perhaps a whiff of foot-stench, some tea like notes and a soft lactic tartness.

Wow, incredibly sweet it does manage to finish with a light tartness, but then it is the sweetness that really lingers on in the palate after a sip.  Vaguely tastes like honey-sweetened Liptons Iced Tea.  My second sip has my palate adjusting to a little more balance between the sweet and the lactic tartness found here.  There is definitely a cider like quality to this beer and again it reminds me of lightly oxidized apples.  Despite being low in alcohol, the sweetness really makes this almost a sipping beer as the excess sugars really add some heft to the body.  A hint of funky foot flavors are sometimes barely noticeable underneath the sweetness.

This is an interesting beer, and definitely an interesting style as I definitely need to try more examples from the traditional Lambic brewers.  Some more interesting funkiness and more aggressive sourness would make this much better and more balanced.  I cant help but think of this as some sort of fruit juice; perhaps a mix of apple cider and sweet tea somehow.  This certainly gets a boost just because it is Faro and I have had so few of these.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Taste: Sugary sweet with touches of treacle to keep the mustiness at bay. Some subtle fruity tones of sour apricots and tart peaches. Even subtler herbal hints. Very small nibble of Colby cheese. The high degree of sweetness manages to hold back the tart and sour qualities, even through to the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Fairly low amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Just as the overly sweet, simplistic Lindemans lambics rarely win me over, the same is true for their faro.

2240,"2009-06-12",1.9,"I like lambics.  Earthy, funky, sour, weird...these are positive descriptors in my book when it comes to beer.  Ive visited Cantilon and really enjoyed the beers I tried there.  But I did not like this beer one bit.  It was sickeningly sweet and definitely gave me the impression that it wasnt done baking yet.

I should mention that this is my first Faro...in fact I think this is the last beer style on this site that I havent tried.  When I visited the Cantillon tasting room, I asked if they had any Faro available for tasting, and the lady behind the bar explained to me in broken English that Faro was not highly thought of...like it was a ""low"" style of lambic.  And after having taste this beer, compared to the gueuze that Ive had, this beer seems not very complex...instead it is sickeningly sweet, cereal-y, and unpleasantly astringent.  This beer was dark and far maltier than I expected.  Imagine a way too grainy beer, with a ton of some sort of sweeter-than-sugar artificial sweetener added.  It also had a weird skunky smell when I opened it which eventually dissipated.

Body is amber brown in color and produces a 1/4"" filmy, white head. Spotty lacing and ample carbonation create for a great appearance. The aroma is a medley of sugary and sour fruits coupled by some light brown sugar, reminds me of plain doughnuts that have just been brought out to cool. Tart with a sticky sweetness and thick finish that coats the mouth. I found the feel somewhat of a drawback due to the heavy sweetness, but the mild tartness is refreshing. Mixed sour fruit and sugary baked good flavors. Somewhat dry, wheat and caramel seem to ease their way into the mix. Hard to pinpoint the aroma and flavor any better, its odd and intriguing.

The taste is sweet candi sugar overlaying an earthy lambic funk.  It probably wont blow you away, but I gather that faros are session beers and it fits that role well.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
2240,"2009-05-16",3.3,"Ok, so this should give me a rating for the faro style.  Huge thanks to Nicholas for bringing me a couple of bottles of this.  Good guy.

Pours a rather muddy, brown color with a decent head that never fully dies.  Tons of sweet sugar and sugary berries in the nose.  Too sweet?  Quite possibly.

The taste is also overwhelmed by sweetness, with touches of dark berries trying to peek out from the candi sugar/brown sugar sweetness.  Notes of raisins.  

Super sweet.  If you know what you are getting into with the style, this is a fun beer.  But...if you dont like sweet, you will hate this beer.  Also, almost no funk noted here...disappointed in that.","USA","rallison"

This has recently hit Ohio and as soon as I saw it I picked up a bottle.  As elusive as faros are the chance to get to try one relatively fresh is a no brainer even if I have no idea how long it has been in transit.  Being from Lindemans it suffers from the typical sweetness but otherwise is not a bad product at all.

Aroma / Appearance - The gradiated body held a thin layer of head.  An most unusual battle of sweet and sour captured my attention.  Underpinning it was the smell of a rustic barnyard on a lazy Saturday afternoon.

Flavor / Palate - The sour bite that comes at first soon mellows out into a musty wet finish.  As it travels across the tongue it leaves a trail of cherries, chocolate milk mix, and funk that was not present in the last faro I sampled.  Its hard to say if I would buy this very often as it is unusual.  On the other hand it is also only $5.49 a bottle which is ""cheap"" for most hard to acquire beers.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The more lingering aftertaste is a lightly barnyardy funk.  Creamy mouthfeel, lighter body and high level of carbonation.  Im not sure what to make of this one.  Im not all that hip on lambics due to their sourness, and this one has barely any, but Im still not really fond of it.

In bocca è dolce e appiccicoso, con sentori di pesca e albicocca, ma una comunque non impercettibile presenza acida che lo nobilita. Somiglia più ad una birra che ad un lambic, in ultima analisi, ma sono giunto a ritenere che non sia un cattivo prodotto; quando assaggerò qualche faro più buono (magari di Cantillon) allora potrò riconsiderare bene la qualità effettiva di questo.","Ronco Scrivia (GE), ITALY","LordCorkscrew"

Bottle green, 375 ml
Appearance: Pours burned orange, peach skin like bosy colour, black breakfast tea like, colour of burned sugar being watered down a bit, body texture is a bit hazy, carbonation of body is lively like a fizzy drink, head is unstable, rathr fizzy to foamy but after a quick initial decrease it becomes very, very small and stable. Head colour is beige. There is quite nice lacing.
Aroma: Front is winy, some powder sugar, caramel and nice burned sugar, some notes of light white table wine, deeper there are some grainy notes, some accidity, creamy, milk, mild and well balanced aroma, ’a bit flowery’, some yeasty notes and wheat with little banana and some spices like clove.
Flavour: Really a very positive experience with my first Lambic. Front is naturally sweet like from the fructose of a very sweet fruit, later on the accidity begins to play a main part in the whole taste, especially just after you swallow the beer, later on there is a strong accidic taste of fresh green apple and natural soft and refreshing citrusy lemon without the shade of bitterness. Rather no hoppy accents playing any significant role here but there is some thin small of bitterness in the deep texture of it and some slight wheaty - malty notes, not that strong to call it bready. Finish duration is long.
Palate: Body is medium, texture is accidic with some sweetness, palate is sticky from burned sugar and perfectly balanced by this stickyness, finish feel is accidic on the one&sweet on the other hand.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

2240,"2007-04-14",3.1,"375 ml bottle, via Papsoe.  Bottle 3 of a 4 bottle Faro tasting.  Pours an orangish copper colored body with a very fine yeast haze and a one finger white head that left lots of lacing.  Aroma is quite funky with a very earthy musty cork and aged leafy hop note.  A little sweaty feet, and no hint of sugar.  Flavor is quite sugary sweet though  with minimal lambic character.  Finishes a little less sweet with some musty moldy cork notes.  Mouthfeel is thinner in texture with minimal to no sugary stickiness and nice lively carbonation.  The most gueuze-like mouthfeel so far.  This seemed to have more of an aged character to it than the others I had.  The nose was actually pretty decent, but it was a let down with the heavy refined sugar flavor.  Better overall than the Chapeau and St Louis because of the nose and mouthfeel of this one.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2240,"2007-04-03",3.2,"The aroma was cork and oak with a strong saccharine characteristic. The aroma was lightly tart with an acidic nature and some estery fruit character. The beer poured into the chalice clear amber with a low white well lasting head. The flavor was sweet, very, very sweet. Along with the sweetness was a  light tartness and a fruity character. The sweetness was forced and unlike a cloying malt sweetness, this was that of saccharine. The finish was sweet, of course, and the body was medium with a fairly low carbonation. I had this in Belgium fresh and found it undrinkable. This bottle was much more pleasurable, but still too sweet for doing anything other than putting on a childs pacifier. 37.5 cl corked and capped bottle, purchased at a Delhaize (Food Lion) in Brussels.","North of Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","NicerInPerson"

The palate is sweet and malty, with lots of good malt flavor, paired with nice candy sugar sweetness, and a back drop of sour fruity flavor. This beer finishes with more good sweet and fruity flavors up front, then ends with some sour fruitness that lingers. Nice beer, very enjoyable, very food friendly.

Aroma of bread left to fester for too long with some dank barnyard malt and rusted car bodies. Its got a feint citric acid note and table sugar which mixed together could easily rust a car! Poured a muddy, tawny bronze with a lovely thick head of cream, well supported by the huge flurry of fine carbonation. Bready in the mouth, light toffee malt upfront (?) with phenyl sweetness across the tongue like diet cola minus the cola. Its just lightly tart, acidic in the sweeter side and sugary like an over-primed lemonade. Very feint showing of candied fruit like oranges and lemons.

I love it.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
