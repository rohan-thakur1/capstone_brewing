1043,"2017-06-05",3.9,"Data wa≈ºno≈õci:  19.05.2024 
 Kolor:  Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Be≈ºowa, drobnoziarnista, umiarkowanie trwa≈Ça. W do≈õƒá szybkim tempie opada do centymetrowego ko≈Çnierzyka.
Pozostawia niewielkie zacieki na szkle. 
 Zapach:  Fajny aromat, ale po takim piwie spodziewa≈Çem siƒô konkretnego kopniaka.
Mamy tutaj sporo ciemnych s≈Çod√≥w, palono≈õƒá, kawƒô espresso i gorzkƒÖ czekoladƒô.
Nastƒôpnie bardzo delikatnƒÖ drewnianƒÖ nutƒô i delikatny szlachetny alkohol.
Ca≈Çkowity brak waniliowych detali.
W oddali charakterystyczna wo≈Ñ sosu sojowego, kt√≥ry w przypadku tego piwa skojarzy≈Ç mi siƒô z rybnym aromatem. 
Na szczƒô≈õcie nie by≈Ço tego du≈ºo 
i po chwili ta nuta uciek≈Ça gdzie≈õ w sinƒÖ dal. 
 Smak:  W smaku wszystko gra, cycu≈õ-glancu≈õ.
Jest umiarkowana doza bourbonowych nut.
Wiƒôcej dƒôbiny, mokrego drewna, tylko odrobina wanilii, dos≈Çownie mu≈õniƒôcie. Poza tym trochƒô ptasiego mleczka, karmelu.
Jest tak≈ºe solidna porcja kawy espresso i gorzkiej czekolady.
Tekstura gƒôsta, zawiesista.
Alkohol dobrze zamaskowany. Goryczka zdumiewajƒÖco wysoka, palony finisz.
Umiarkowane nagazowanie. 
 Wysycenie:  ≈örednie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Trochƒô zaskoczy≈Ç mnie ten George. My≈õla≈Çem, ≈ºe bƒôdzie s≈Çodki, taki w moim gu≈õcie. Okaza≈Ç siƒô raczej p√≥≈Çwytrawny.
Beczka po bourbonie nie by≈Ça tak ewidentna jak w przypadku kilku innych piw choƒáby nawet z Mikkellera.
Piwo by≈Ço butelkowane w maju 2014, a wiƒôc ma ju≈º ponad 3 lata.
Nasuwa siƒô na my≈õl do≈õƒá lu≈∫ny wniosek, ≈ºe George niezbyt dobrze siƒô starzeje. 
Niemniej jednak, ≈ºeby nikt mnie ≈∫le nie zrozumia≈Ç - to nadal bardzo dobre piwo, tylko moje oczekiwania by≈Çy du≈ºo wy≈ºsze.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

1043,"2017-01-21",3.8,"Bottle (undated) at Brew Dog Sodermalm, 11/29/16.Very nice appearance, with some clarity visible on the maroon/burgundy-tinted edges. Dark mahogany body and a large, tan head atop showing strong retention.The nose is a good mix of fairly strong, but not obnoxiously-so, bourbon and wood with plentiful roast, fudge and caramel, as one would expect. Seems to be quite sweet, but again, not nearly to the point of being put-off. Alcohol-wise, it¬ís there, of course, but isn¬ít intense or burning. There is a bit of strong ester, almost banana-like, on the very end, but this very likely could come from the bourbon just as much as it could from the yeast. Overall, a rich, rather intense nose that doesn¬ít quite go over-the-top.In the mouth, it¬ís thick, though not syrupy, with an almost granular quality to it. Tons of rich caramel and fudge with a slight espresso hint, transitioning quickly to a more spicy, liquor-like bourbon character. Low carbonation but ample and mostly engaging for what¬ís there. Alcohol nicely folded in to the rich layers of bourbon, caramel, fudge and roast. Fair acidity on the end helps with balance, as well. Nice stuff, nothing really stood out to me, but it¬ís pretty under control for its size and richness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1043,"2016-12-25",3.4,"Bottle on X-mas. Sharp aroma of licorice, slightly charred plastic and burnt coffee. Any bourbon scent is very hidden. The first sip reveals notes of oxidation along with dark chocolate and a heck of a lot more alcohol than the nose suggests. Again, the bourbon notes barely emerge.

Bourbon barrel aging often does nice things to a beer¬ís aroma, and this is no exception, there¬ís the lovely sweet vanilla that you¬íd expect, and the coffee too. Does smell very sweet, though, I hope this isn¬ít the disaster that normal George is (which also smelt great). Smooth palate, heading towards slick. Wafting plenty of alcohol, but rich roasted and burntness make this more of a sipper where  that level of alcohol is more expected. Certainly tasty, and most surprisingly, given the previous George abomination, not too sweet - only very very sweet, but just staying in the realms of sippability.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

The flavor found a bit more sharp bourbon, oak, and peaty notes than I needed, but it was still tasty.. well-roasted, ashy black patent malts, espresso, and molasses at the core.. bourbon cut through rather well.. dry, tangy oak on the edges.. finished with a sharp, kinda hot hit.  Heavy-bodied with enough carbonation to keep it moving.. almost buttery smooth on the middle.. too bad the transitions were a little off.

1043,"2012-03-06",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/19/2011.  Poured from a 25 cl botttle into a tulip. Thanks to Dunt for bringing this bottle.

The appearance is pitch black with a very impressive, angry cherry brown head. Although creamy, the head cannot hold its own and fades to a ring quickly, leaving just a few spots of lace.

Soft but noticeable bourbon, roasted malt, a bit of chocolate covered espresso beans, a little bit of tobacco all create a solid aroma.

There is a good dark chocolate and roasted malt flavor with a bit of bourbon in the flavor up front. Some smoke, tobacco, a littel bit of caramel, molasses, and a bit of vanilla in the middle. The finish has a little oak, bourbon, and some soft tart cherry skin.

This is very full bodied, that much is apparent even from the appearance. The carbonation is creamy and smooth, and the mouth is left a little bit sticky, although this is not that sweet of a beer. 

Impressive. The flavor is subtle, complex, and interesting, and the mouthfeel supports the flavor well. Call me a fan, and call me sad that I won¬ít be able to get more easily.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Full, viscous body; medium-light to light carbonation; heavy and noticeably oily on the palate; mouthcoating stuff here. Lots of intense bitter chocolate and cocoa mixed with chocolate milk and a lightly charred barrel character (more reserved than in the aroma); a weighty, damn tasty dessert via snifter, with juicy dark fruits and a core meatiness emerge as this warms; a delicious barrel-aged imperial stout, once you get past that initial sharp char approach.

1043,"2012-01-09",4.4,"Bottle from El Irland√©s. Small bottle (250 ml) served at room temperature. This Imperial Stout impresses with a very cloudy quasi black color and a rocky brown-yellowish head that leaves a great lacing after a while. It gives a spectacular and intense malty aroma of Kahlua, cocoa, vanilla, Jack Daniels, oak and overripe berries. A slight herbal trace reminds of German herb liquor like J√§germeister. Then I start sipping this behemoth: The outstanding taste is incredible; an initial sweetness with notes of dark fruits, raisins and oaky vanilla gives way to stronger, boozier notes in the finish with hints of bourbon, wood and molasses with lots of spices. A very subtle trace of sourness adds to the complexity of this monster brew. Full body (but not chewy) with generous alcohol levels that compliment the taste very well instead of appearing as a flaw. An impressive and long finish leaves a superb aftertaste. So, again, I wonder if this is an Imperial Stout or a very malty Barley Wine. I can¬ít feel the roastiness but I get a wonderful overdose of booze. Anyway, it¬ís incredible and it would be interesting to see how it ages.

And the mark of this aging is marvelous, even notes aren¬ít so intense. Willing to know which bourbon was, vanilla and wood mixes perfectly among notes of citrus. But let¬ís go to flavor. If someone would ever ask me to define the concept of bourbon-beer, well, George BA fits perfectly. Paid attention, this is the peculiarity but limit as well; you know, I¬ím expecting a solid malt component, but it¬ís too much liquor-creamy for me; fizzy, but lacks some sharp - not rough, sharp - character, something heavy and elegant at same time. You could find, like the normal George, coffee, red wine, and that sweetness failing. Finish it¬ís like the normal version, so it¬ís pleasant towards citrus and hops.

Served in a Mikkeller long-stem tulip, if you can call it that.

Pours near black with a huge light tan head that persists and persists until the point that it was annoying that I had to wait to be able to sip at it. After that, the nose hits hard with bourbon, oak, and a bit of spice. Maybe a bit of cinnamon. Really interesting. Flavor mixes bourbon and stout notes quite well. A bit of dark chocolate to go with the spice. Full, chewy body with light carbonation. Spicy. Can¬ít quite pin down what that is, but it reminds me a bit of Hunahpu¬ís (not chili), so I¬ím thinking cinnamon. Either way, really tasty and enjoyable.

1043,"2011-09-04",3.7,"A big thanks to MlhopeTC for bringing this to our tasting.
A - Poured a very dark Brown with a small but pretty brown head that left a little bit of lacing.
S - This is where the beer shined! Sweet brown sugar, vanilla, and Bourbon dominate with undertones of wood and a hint of smoke. There is a very subtle spicy booze aroma at the end as well.
T - First hits your lips with not all that much flavor. Some wood, and smoke, not too much to write home about. Then in the middle of your taste you get all the Bourbon, brown sugar and vanilla, truly wonderful if only for that brief moment. Then as it goes down the flavor all but disappears leaving a dry nutty after taste with a hint of tang in your mouth that is not overly pleasant. Mostly just not what I am looking for with the style.
M - another disappointment of sorts as it was much thinner than I would have guessed or wanted. medium bodied, decently carbonated but nothing to write home about.
O - A more than decent beer that just can¬ít live up to others of the same style. My expectations were high and were not met. would i drink this beer again, Certainly!

Stunning blending as ever by Mikkeller and this is another brew of fine distinction.

Delicious chocolate and tiramisu sweetness, sweet marsala, sugar coated hazelnuts, near perfect vanilla component, delicious oak qualities. The aroma is insanely good. Near perfectly balanced sweetness, the components just really work together.
The taste is just massive. At first the sweetness, tiramisu, chocolate, vanilla and bourbon dominate. Then the coffee, bitter espresso, hard roasted malts, a bit of earthy hops, a small roasted sourness.
