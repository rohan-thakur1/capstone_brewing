The head is  medium white and leaves some lace. The aroma is very funky with some lemon rind and a slight alcohol character. There is some good barnyard aromas along with some citrus and new oak. The flavor follows perfectly dry with that essential lemon rind character. This beer is all kinds of tart with plenty of sourness however it has some great fruitiness and a mild malty and spicy character to it as well. Everything about this beer works in this sort of perfect unison. Of course you can tell that Jolly Pumpkin house character is in there, but I cant wait to see what these folks do at their own brewery, theyll be standing on the shoulders of a giant no doubt. 

 I wish I could drink this beer every single day, multiple times a day. The cost of something like this is of course is one of the biggest arguing points for working on your homebrewing chops.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

4584,"2010-03-21",4.1,"750ml bottle, 2007 Vintage.  Pours a bright vibrant yellow body with a fizzy bright white head that had amazing retention and left tons of thick heavy lacing.  The nose is just awesome, bright and bretty with some floral and perfume qualities.  Theres tons of brett in here, yet it smells so clean and vibrant.  The flavor is as bretty as the nose indicated, this is as unlike any Wit as I have ever had.  Theres not over-spicing or any dumbing down going on here.  Its not quite as in your face as most Jolly Pumpkin beers are, but I really think its just delicious.  A little sweet, a touch sour, and so bright it just bursts on the tongue.  Lots of tropical fruits and just the lightest most subtle coriander and orange peel spicing.  Mouthfeel is light and airy with perfect fizzy lively carbonation.  Overall I liked this better than any White Ale than Ive ever had.  Delicious.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

4584,"2009-10-15",3.4,"500mL bottle courtesy of xnoxhatex poured into a tulip.  My first beer from this brewery actually.

Pours a bright, hazy golden yellow with a big bubbly white head that is continually fed by a steady stream of bubbles from the bottom.  The lacing is very good and a rocky white cap stays on for the duration.

The aroma has tart lemons with a healthy dose of yeasty sourness and some barnyard funk creeping in.  There are plenty of spices, including clove, and bready malts in the background.

The taste is very tart up front, a combination of tart, sweet fruits and the Belgian yeast.  The bready malts form a backbone that gives way to a dry, yeasty finish with the funk lingering on the palate.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and spritzy on the palate with lots of bubbly carbonation.  Its dry and much more tart than a typical Belgian wit, but its also extremely refreshing with the tartness really adding a complexity that I enjoyed.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
4584,"2009-10-04",3.7,"Bottle. Aroma of brett, pineapple, lemon, grapes, wheat. Wheat comes out more in the flavor, which is also where the citrus and coriander notes can be perceived beneath the lightly tart funky component more prevalent in the nose. The combination of the base beer and the JP components work together nicely on this one to create a refreshing, dry, more-complex-than-just-pure-funky brew.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
4584,"2009-10-04",3.8,"Bottle.  Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a thick white head.  Aroma of sour funk (barnyard), tart candies, lemon, bready malt, and light citrus.  Flavor is light and sour with bready malt in the background.  Overall, light crisp sourness with a touch of bitter hops.  Not really a witbier; this just tastes like the other Jolly Pumpkin sour ales or maybe a sour Belgian ale (pretty similar to Bam Biere).  Enjoyable.

A most seductive perfume of pineapples, lemon zest, pears and frolicking funk is daubed onto soft wheat, coriander and spicy bitterness for yet another tantalizing Wild Witbier creation from Jolly Pumpkin.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy blond.
-The chosen oak barrels are just perfect for this beer.
-Carbonation is frothy and beautifully enlightens the mouthfeel and ebullient flavor profile.
-The tropical fruitiness is eloquent and so pleasurable.
-Brettanomyces and lactobacillus seem to be enjoying each other quite a bit.

As expected, the nose is very much like a Jolly Pumpkin brew.  Tart lemon and orange rind add a distinctly citric acidity, why a dry, pale wheat background is spiced with light coriander and perfumy, floral hops.  Dry, funky oak notes finish off the nose.  Flavors are dry, citric, and refreshing.  Lemon stands out as the dominant fruit component, but lightly sweet orange is present as well.  The coriander is subtle, which is a good thing, and the signature JP oaken yeast funk permeates everything.

4584,"2008-08-10",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2008 In short: A smooth extra-bretty slightly spicy and very funky beer.  A great Bam Biere alternative

In long: Nose has typical Jolly Pumpkin funky barrel signature.  Extremely bretty, lively carbonation, somewhat lemony, medium acidity, high tartness level, some orange and lemon peels, some coriander, dry sandy finish.  This is a Bam Bier but a little less bretty and some added coriander and dry orange skins.  A fantastic beer.  Im starting to believe that its not the Jolly Pumpkin brewer that is the key, its all about the barrels.  To me it seems that anything you put in those barrels comes out amazingly pleasurable.

4584,"2008-02-26",3.4,"750 ml bottle
I found this at Bella Vino a few months ago.  It was time to crack it open since this is not exactly a beer that struck me as a good candidate for any more aging.  Its probably the least interesting in the Jolly Pumpkin lineup to date.  However I think that has more to do with the style than anything else.  Its hard to get excited about a light sessionable witbier when you know what else is available.  I still recommend giving it a shot if you can find a fresh bottle.
Aroma / Appearance - A fast growing head took over most of the glass.  It took quite a while to settle down to something reasonable.  When it did I admired the carbonated transparent golden body underneath.  This had all the hallmarks of a light sessionable starter.  The nose was pretty clean - white pepper, lightly aged oak and honeycomb.  A florally playfulness kept it all together.  It was somewhat like fresh hot popcorn without that cheap movie butter.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was spicy and carbonated.  Honeydew melons blended with lemon zest and apple cores made the otherwise simple experience worthwhile.  This was perhaps a bit more like an apple cider than a beer.  On the other hand it is very sessionable and did not take long to finish off.  Try it before you crack open that three year old bottle of Expedition Stout or Dark Lord.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4584,"2008-01-26",4.7,"Let me make this clear - Im not going to rate this as a Witbier. This is a funky saison. Basically Bam Biere, which is not a bad thing.

Super funky, with farmhouse, stinky cheese, apples, ginger, pepper, some anise, and tons more. Beautifully complex aroma. Taste funky as all hell! Sour acidic flavors burst forth with apple, pepper, spicy and citrus notes following. Finishes super dry, with long lingering brett acidity, slight hop bitterness and a pleasant nutty flavor. What a beast of a beer! The mouthfeel is a bit over carbonated in my opinion, but overall this is fantastical. I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for Leelanau.

4584,"2007-07-28",4.2,"Pours with a fully hazy, yet bright yellow-straw colored bee.  It is topped by a pillowy, frothy, pale, off-white colored head that starts out a full four fingers in thickness; the head dissipates at a medium pace, but always keeps the beer fully crowned by at least a thin layer of froth.  The aroma is a mix of damp spices; sort of a mix of a damp, freshly rained upon earthiness, some definite orange zest, a smooth lemon-like & cleanly earthy coriander note as well as a mix of ginger, white pepper, something floral (like mix of honeysuckle & orange blossom).  This has a fantastic nose to it; quite vibrant & actually quite spice dominated, yet the spices are so well integrated that they are not too much.  There are some hints of funkiness here, but for now they are really quite soft.

Quite dry and it is well carbonated as the beer froths up as it hits my tongue for the first time.  The bone dry character of this beer accentuates a nice, almost biting, tartness that, with the orange zest notes, makes this beer taste lemon like.  Despite coming from the Jolly Pumpkin brewery, this is actually quite clean tasting; I wouldnt guess there were any wild bugs here.  There is a soft oak character to this beer though; it is barely perceptible at first, but contributes a oak-like spiciness as well as a touch of tannic backbone.  Both of these wood-derived notes are noticeable in the finish.  The wood is actually at just about a perfect level of flavor integration; it is subtle enough that it is almost not noticeable, yet it does contribute to the character of this brew, even if it is just a supporting role.  Soft, zesty notes of coriander sort of blend with the spicy oak notes.  The beer is not nearly as spicy in the flavor as it was in the nose; ultimately I think this is a good thing as it allows hints of barrel notes as well as a soft wheat character to come through in the flavor.  Flavor notes of orange blossom honey, subtle-yet-sharp lavender, white pepper and young ginger are all noticeable in the taste.

This is a very nice example of a Wit beer.  Despite the fact that I was hoping for some wild funkiness (which is certainly not here), I am really enjoying this beer.  I really like the mix of spice notes, grain character and the fact that this is bone dry and so light and drinkable; truely a perfect warm weather drinker.  I am a sucker for Wit beers and this one really hits the style & more importantly it hits the spot that satisfies my craving for tasty Wit beers.  This is possibly one of the best, non-funky Wits out there.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Smells of perfumy flowers, dough, coriander, oranges, lemons and lots of untamed wild character.  None of the oak comes through on the nose.  As the beer warms, some soapy qualities begin to emerge.  Taste is of lemons with an underlying sourness.  Again, no oak, but lots of interesting perfumy qualities.  Some coriander is present but not overwhelming.  Some peppery splashes and lemon are present on the mouthfeel.  Finish is lightly sour and very quaffable.  Well done!","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

I recommend this beer for picnics, the beach,or romantic dinner maybe shrimp pasta or pork tenderloin. remarkably refreshing I could put it in my water bottle on my mountain bike.

Head lingers throughout the consumption. Very yeasty aroma with notes of lemongrass, brettanomyces, fresh sliced apples and banana. Taste is more of the same, very sour but ultimately very clean, crisp, refreshing. Leather and the wonderful oak presence mingle with orange peels and lambic- like, nose tingling funk. Taste is similar, but even more sour than the nose indicated. Wonderful mouthfeel with creamy, lively carbonation. Finish is pure as driven snow. Awesome work Ron!

Medium-bodied and acerbic with lively carbonation. Finishes very tart with just a rumor of pale malt sweetness. This is definitely a love it or hate it beer - just look at that standard deviation!

4584,"2006-12-21",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2006 2006 bottle (750mL) enjoyed at Slows BBQ on 11/5/06Magnificent amounts of creamy white head are slow to recede.  The body has a typical haziness of other JP beers, though still demonstrates a fair enough clarity.  Appropriate white-gold and lemon colored Belgian wit color.  Sheets of lace cover the glass.  Excellent appearance as usual from JP.Tart, even a touch sourish nose is full of vanilla wafers, gobs of honey and bitter lemons.  The esters immediately go to work on the malt, bringing it down to nearly nothing and providing an excellent crispness.  Spicing is moderately done, contributing a dry, leafy coriander note, with airy white pepper and juicy lemon sugar cookies (from a mix of the citrus zest and pils malt).  Some lactic notes are evident on the finish, giving it a bit of a hard edge, which somewhat detracts from this more playful of styles.  Strength of aroma is high, with no alcohol or flaws.  Barrel character contributes some tannins, giving a slightly sharp note as well.Fluffy, pastry dough crust is injected with more vanilla wafers and then drizzled with lemon icing.  Suddenly someone spills a few drops of 3F lambic in the pie.  Light sourness takes hold, followed by a very crisp finish filled with perfumey esters, dry fruit skins and fresh, chewy coriander.  Some nutty wood notes help control the sourness somewhat, and light oak oiliness adds a strange twist on the belgian wit bier style.  Tight, engaging carbonation greatly helps out where it can, and a not (yet?) too underattenuated body throws enough sweet, honeyish malt in to the equation.  Dont get much wheat flavor/aroma, though it no doubt contributes to the head retention and texture.Still, if youre going in to this expecting hoegaarden (which you shouldnt be), youre not going to be a happy camper.  Youve definitely got to enjoy what Ron is doing to get in to this one.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4584,"2006-01-26",3.9,"(750 ml bottle: Obtained in trade with Pailhead, thanks Kevin!) Im opening this beer with the intention of getting in a quick rating right before going to work, and then bringing the rest of the bottle for my co-workers.  But only if the beer is good, so well see.  First impression: this is perhaps the most sour witbier Ive ever had!  Its very lemony, tart and acidic.  Honestly, this is pushing toward lambic-like sourness, though the lemony sourness does fade off the palate fairly quickly.  Lots of funk right from the start, but especially in the finish.  Lightly bitter orange peel is definitely there, most noticeably in the finish, but the coriander is barely recognizable behind the sourness.  Aromas of funk, sour lemon, and a moderate mustiness take me back to those thoughts of lambics again.  Light bodied, but very clean and crisp, nicely carbonated, and very refreshing.  Man, I could drink this all day (foreshadowing intended).  Very bright, radiant pale yellow in color and fairly cloudy, the beer has a thin, snow white cap.  Large patches of lace remain on the glass for quite some time.  Once past the initial shock of, ""Hey, this isnt a witbier!"", I think this beer is great.  Crisp, sour, funky, refreshing.  Ive enjoyed this beer so much, Ill definitely brought the second half of the bottle to work with me.So I brought the beer to work (a liquor store) and let my co-workers sample a few ounces.  Everyone really liked it.  I kept sneaking into the break room to sip on this beer for nearly two hours, and the beer only got better as it warmed up.  The lemony sourness subsided somewhat, and the coriander picked up, so the beer evolves wonderfully, becoming more balanced and more closely resembling the witbier I was expecting.  And the head maintained that cap for the duration.  Just an outstanding beer that I think should be well-chilled before serving, but give the beer plenty of time to warm up and evolve.  A wonderful first start for Leelanau Brewing, and now I really cant wait for their next masterpiece thats due out in March, 2006.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Id tried that beer at the Michigan brewers fest and disliked it a lot. This bottled form is at the opposite end of the spectrum to me, having brett spelled all over it. Immensely perfumey, explosive in its fruitiness (think appels, pineapple - all not ripe at all and still fairly sour). Tart flavour profile with banana, spices and orange notes all along. Pretty much no hops were perceived, I might have prefered a few. As it is, its not that complex, mostly just wild and this is fun as well, but leaves a feeling of unripeness. Still, I found it adorable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
