Light nose of chocolate, Belgian yeast, candi sugar and hints of dark fruit and roast. Medium bodied with a nice slick texture that hints at creaminess. Above normal carbonation with effervescence in the middle and finish. The excellent flavor profile is of reasonable intensity, quite complex and exceptionally balanced. It begins with semisweet dark chocolate over a very mild roast character. As the effervescent middle begins, the chocolate fades to candi sugar sweetness and more of the roast character is noted. As this sweetness fades, dark fruit notes come to the forefront. The finish is smooth, but has dry characteristics, and a bit of hop flavor and bitterness in addition to hints of coffee.

Just a hint of clove (stings the nostrils) and ripe banana. Whatever stone fruit sweetness there is is immediately blunted by a basement/musty funk.

The flavor is stone fruits (plum, raisin, pungent dates) right off the bat. Subsequently there is a very heavy basement/horseblanket second wave, that is both funky and darkly sweet. Some major tobacco on the back and when it warms up.

A: pours a dark, dark coffee crown with murky clarity. Thin, fine foam cap forms on the surface and stick around for the duration. 

S: lots of candy, raw sugar smell. Sweet roated malts are light on the nasal passage and offer up some backgrounds of nuts, earthy noble hops. Pretty good.

T: Less sweet than anticipated. Anise, cloves, coffee, dry roasted malts. Really nice. Finish is short lived, but strong like I were drinking an americano. Yum!

1969,"2013-03-24",3.4,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a chalice. There was no discernible freshness date.

Appearance: Dark brown/black opaque body. Forms a small, eggshell, soapy head which mostly dissipates and leaves little lacing on the glass. 

Smell: Classic stout aroma plus a classic Belgian yeast aroma. Strange but interesting.

Taste: I should disclaim this review by mentioning that I have had this beer before on tap and it was pretty amazing. Id never seen it in bottles until recently, so I grabbed one when I had the chance. I have to say Im pretty disappointed by the difference between the tap and bottle versions. Even though its been a while between decantation, the memory of that beer being amazing stayed fresh. Allagash Black in the bottle isnt so much a good or bad beer as it is weird. The authentic Belgian yeast strain really makes itself known, but so does the classic strong stout base and the two conflict. 

The palate begins rather mild with a general stout flavor. Light chocolate and coffee notes are noticeable, though they amplify greatly at the apex. Theres a strong dry bitterness of burnt coffee, dark chocolate and Belgian yeast spiciness. As it finishes the Belgian yeast becomes much more prominent, imparting slight banana and potpourri flavors, but theres still noticeable chocolate and coffee as well. When all these notes collide they create for a strange, almost fish-like taste, leaving an aftertaste of coffee. Though at no point is this palate repulsive, its just an eyebrow-raiser. 

Drinkability: Belgian beers are known for being zesty and effervescent, and while thats true of Allagash Black, its still a remarkably drinker-friendly palate. A mouthfeel thats on the thinner side with no alcohol presence at all. The aftertaste is slightly dry and bitter, but is akin to coffee so its easily tolerable. The 7.5% ABV seems right on point, if not a tad high, but I doubt many drinkers will find it challenging to drink in large quantities.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aroma: The nose is Belgian yeast, some strong fruity notes, and hints of caramel and chocolate

Appearance: It pours a dark brown color with a frothy, lasting, light brown head that leaves heavy lacing

Flavor: The taste is mid-sweet, with a strong Belgian-style flavor, and some light closing bitterness

Palate: The body is medium-plus, it feels fairly creamy and a little thick, with a soft carbonation

Overall Impression: 
This is a pretty interesting beer.  I was surprised that I hadnt rated it before, but I didnt remember it at all, so I got a nice surprise.  It really didnt have much of a stout feel to it.  The Belgian yeast is the main component of this one, those caramel and chocolate malts are quite muted, surprisingly so, considering the style.  Anyway, I enjoyed this beer, but if I drank it blind I never would have guessed stout.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

I can smell chocolate, caramel, and spicy wheat with a bit of pepper and and hint of oxidation. Light sweet fruits mixed with a bit of yeasty funk and fruitiness round out the nose well. The flavor is chocolate and caramel up front followed by a huge ashy and then oxidized taste that seems odd. Light fruit and yeasty phenols sweep in to mop that up then a chocolatey roasty ashy flavor lingers long into the finish of every sip.

Taste is sweeter than expected, not cloying or even sugary, but that candis is front and center and attacks from the first sip.

1969,"2012-10-19",3.9,"Reviewed 9/29. About 7 oz poured into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a dark brown color that betrays a hint of transparency even in this dark environment. The head is a one finger light khaki color that fades to a thin collar relatively quickly. Theres a hint of spotty lacing on the glass.

S: Rather estery, especially with pear and apple. I have to dig around to notice the chocolate and roast, but its there. Another taste noticed a touch of sourness.

T: At first, its a bit roasty and chocolaty, but the finish betrays its Belgian roots with fruity apple esters. The faint touch of sourness on the aroma comes through on the general flavor, which I really appreciate. It really takes a few sips to appreciate everything going on in the profile, but once that happens, one can really appreciate the complexity and nuance within this.

First thing I picked up off this brew is coffee.  Followed up by dark roasted malt.  Slight chocolate presence mixed in with an even smaller candi sugar presence.  Decent aroma.

Coffee backs off a bit here and meshes well with the sweetness of the chocolate. Some smoked, charred malt character and a yeasty taste can be tasted in the background.  Not huge but if I didnt know it I would think this is a 100% an American Stout.  Either my palette isnt trained well enough yet or Im losing it in my old age.

1969,"2011-04-13",3.9,"A remarkably drinkable beer given its high-ish alcohol content, this sat black (natch) in the glass beneath a thin cap of foam. I use the term ""glass"" loosely, because in fact this was poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tiny plastic stein at Brew Fest in Athens, GA. Even alongside the rarities and oddities at that event, this stood out for its subtle and pleasant blend of roast flavors. Nut skins, coffee, and chocolate abounded, never competing with one another and marrying beautifully with a whiff of funk from the Belgian yeast. Another fine offering from Allagash.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

Not a very rich aroma, slight hints of sweet malts and yeast are the lead. Wonderful flavors of dark chocolate, like that 85% caocao kind, along with roasted malts. Mouthfeel is great, smooth and a mild yet bubbly carbonation. Its a little pricey but I also got it at cost, so I bought two cases, some for trade and some for cellaring.

A subtle roast aroma is prevalent. There is a soft yeast aroma, and an even softer hop aroma. Fairly nuanced aroma, but nothing here screams ""exceptional"" in any way. Im hit with a blast of, unexpected, coffee. The roast is not astringent, but beautiful in the way it lingers. There is a subtle sweet yeast flavor that blends with a subtle chocolate flavor. The beer is quite fizzy, almost annoyingly so. The yeast is becoming more pungent as the beer warms up. Overall, weve got something pretty good here.

1969,"2011-01-10",3.1,"Pours black with a tall, foamy, tan head. Lack of viscosity (in comparison to other stouts) is quite evident as the beer sloshes around quite freely like water. Aroma carries hints of chocolate and coffee, but most predominant is a dark fruit/sugary smell, with touches of smokiness and black licorice. Taste contains many of these elements, but unfortunately an overwhelming cherry presence makes much of them hard to pick up on (not aided by the increased licorice flavor). While I didnt like the taste, I do wish more of my beers could feel like this despite the surprising thinness, Black is extremely creamy, thanks in to a lively carbonation.

1969,"2010-12-02",3.9,"Appearance: black under a khaki head which leaves massive lace in its wake. Eventually settles into a thin layer. Swirls with minimal lace and head.

Nose: chewy. Chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate graham crackers. Truffle powder sprinkles about. Hint of meaty dark fruits in the back; plums, raisins. Black licorice root for some more meat and weight. Overall very chocolaty; permeates.

Palate: smooth and cakey; moist rich decadent cakes. Chocolate and homemade chocolate fudge in the back. Effervescence lifts what would otherwise be a heavy beer and carries her across eager tastebuds. Raisins and prunes are scattered throughout the chocolate cake and fudge. Lingers long on top of the tongue with a faint dry finish; truffle powder. Little to no spice. Dried fruits in the middle; more prunes and raisins. A river of melted European chocolates underneath.

Final Thoughts: not overly complex but very decadent. One has the sense of partaking of a fine gilded brew best served in crystal chalices with chandeliers about. Nonetheless, also very approachable, balanced, and unpretentious. An everyday beer hidden behind the guise of sophistication. Once more Allagash delights.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1969,"2010-10-26",3.3,"Enjoyed from a 750ml bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a semi-translucent black color, with a mild light tan head.  The nose shows characters similar to Schwarzbier; grainy pilsner malt, along with subtle ash and roasted notes.  The beer seems to lack the malty/estery/just-barely-roasty bouquet of classics such as De Dolle Export.  A subtle ester profile comes through. The palate also seems off-style and slightly over-attenuated.   Roasted malt character, a background bitterness, and some esters toward the finish that show themselves to be Belgian, but that again lack character or assertiveness.  The finish leaves a lingering grainy roasty note.  Overall, a disappointment from an excellent brewery that generally turns out absolutely excellent interpretations of classic Belgian styles.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Original Review February 27, 2010:
750ml bottle, batch #9.  Pours very dark brown with a large 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy light brown head.  Maintains a small cap and leaves a few clumps of lacing.

Flavor is much stronger, big milk chocolate, dark roasted malts, some coffee, a little yeast, bitterness on the finish.

Aroma is a nice blend of dry roasts and coffees, bittersweet dark chocolates, and fruity yeast. Some deeper toffee malts, nuts, earthy pepper, and mint. Flavor is plentiful, but gentle. Roasts and a light coffee greet the tongue along with a fruity, slightly estery yeast. Richer than the aroma, toffee malts and chocolates offer a balancing sweetness. Smooth, nutty brown malts and pecans guide this into the finish where a soft, minty pepper leads to a medium, earthy bitterness and a dry, roasty, somewhat burnt finish. Aftertaste lingers for a lengthy duration after a light to medium body and a creamy carbonation. Overall, a very tasty Belgian styled stout. The Belgian yeast is well integrated and balanced with the rest of the big, but gentle flavors. Solid stuff.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

coffee and roasted malt flavors that give an impression of a Belgian dark strong ale with coffee flavor mixed in, there is some malt sweetness in this drink but it is pretty dry on the tongue.  I guess this ale needs to warm up almost to room temperature before the aromas and flavors come forth, some raisin and prune with burnt sugar and/or blackstrap molasses flavors emerged as it warmed, a light bitterness at the finish, 
I thought this had a thin mouth feel for a Foreign Stout compared to some other Foreign Stouts, light and bubbly on the tongue, this ale does have a light and airy feel on the palate that I get with many Belgian beers, this ale was ok but I was not impressed with this, I was hoping for something more.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

1969,"2009-06-10",2.4,"Allagash black
Dark body that is brown around the edges, very loose bubbled head. Roast chocolate nose with a musty note, and a fruit scent that carries the yeast note nicely. Fruity taste that turns to roast quickly and finishes burnt. Dusty flavor throughout, not all that pleasant, does not develop over time, same flavors at the end of the bottle as the beginning, gets a bit more yeasty, but the roast is just too dominant for me. Some smoky flavors.  The fruity notes do not balance and the chocolate is just not strong enough. Very similar to hercule. A bit tart at some points. I have to start staying away from Belgian stout type beers yet to find one I enjoy.

Picked up at a store nearby a few months ago I got around to opening this after a tasting the evening before.  As I suspected even a few months meant it lost some freshness but it was still a superb beer.  The blend of Belgian cultures and stout create a perfect storm of liquid gold.

Aroma / Appearance - The short lived head cedes to a fluid black body.  Sheens of lacing slink down the sides of the snifter leaving behind clear trails of alcohol.  The smell of cigarette smoke in a dusty used bookstore gives this beer a nice musky profile.  Some sweetness sneaks in after a period of letting it warm.

Flavor / Palate - Washing smoothly across the tongue this beer has enough taste to make it enjoyable and yet not heavy on the palate.  Roasted malt, ash, black coffee, and a woody finish mark a balanced experience.  A bit pricey at $8.99 I may not be picking this up again but if you are a fan of well made stouts from intelligent breweries share it with a friend.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1969,"2009-01-18",3.7,"There seem to be a lot of brewers experimenting with ""Belgian style"" stouts lately...or at least I seem to be trying a lot of them for the first time lately.  They tend to fall in one of a few categories:  either they are Un-Belgian-y (just stout-like and roasty), too Belgian-y (Buffalo Belgian Stout), or just right (Weyerbacher XIII).  I would put this one in the Un-Belgian-y category...there was plenty of roastiness, but none of the mouthfeel or yeast or spice notes that I associate with Belgian-style beer.

It was black, it was roasty, it was ot very Belgian-y.  It reminded me of a milk stout, and a very good milk stout at that.  I would suggest that this beer is not exactly on-target (as far as the description is concerned) but I nonetheless thought this to be a very good beer.

1969,"2009-01-07",4.0,"In the last half of 2007, the biere du jour seemed to be the Belgian stout (with most versions pushing the imperial status as far as gravity was concerned).  Allagash cashed in towards the end of this trend and really capped things off with what Id consider to be the best commercial example of the ""style"".  So patience really paid off here.  Having had samples of the bottle, cask and draught from batch 1 onwards, the beer began great and has remained functionally unchanged in its present incarnation.  I found the bottle, with its penchant for evolving more quickly thanks to the more rapid bottle refermentation when compared to a keg, and its more spritzy carbonation (though this is hardly a ""spritzily"" carbonated beer), to be a bit more dry, and more focused in its dual display of sweet chocolate and dry, moderately bitter roast; though detracting little from the draught version, which is simply more of a hearty, chewier, slightly more sweet ""foreign"" stout, in the real sense of the style (which it only somewhat approximates).  No, the bottle is certainly more a roasty American stout-meets-Belgian yeast.  Light notes of vanilla, cocoa and chocolate syrup are found in all versions, with a medium-dry finish in all cases, as well.  What I really applaud here is the restraint on the gravity/abv which allows for more focus on the malt and yeast and avoids any obtrusive alcohol sharpness/dryness/heat.  The cask was delicious as well, achieving a chocolate fudge iced cream-like flavor and consistency, with fresh Belgian yeast softness on the finish and a creamy mouthfeel that turned it more towards the decadent.

Flavor is also pretty soft, but very well balanced with notes of vanilla, oak,  pretty bland hops, and some hints of dark cherry.

1969,"2008-07-16",4.1,"Excellent beer. Wow am I glad I got to try this. $4.75 for a pint instead of $12 for a bottle, and at a bar too..I was surprised to say the least. The roast on this one is very light, and it tastes of fresh toffee and caramel instead of traditional burnt coffee and chocolate. Very welcoming ale that drinks like a potently flavorful low-alcohol because of how smooth it is. Toffee, dark and light, and heavy caramel are the extent of the complexity of this beer, but it was extremely enjoyable.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"

1969,"2008-06-19",3.9,"THOUGHTS: Maybe not the best foreign stout, but a very interesting beer. A little lacking in aroma. That Allagash yeasty smell seemed to dominate. But the aroma and flavor improved the warmer it got. This seemed more Belgian than foreign stout. This is one of those hybrid beers that should really have its own category if anyone else can ever make something like this.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was nearly black in the glass with light reddish highlights and a small to average, off white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing that ran back into the glass quickly. The aroma was complex, but dominated by alcohol and yeast. The rest of the aromas were underlying. They were moderate chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, mild coffee as it warmed, mod yeast, raisin, plum, prune, port wine, some spices, maybe some cherry and a surprising amount of alcohol for the ABV. The initial flavor was lightly to moderately sweet and lightly acidic and bitter; while the finish was moderately to heavily sweet and bitter, and lightly acidic, and just a little sour right at the end with an average duration. The flavor was  sort of a mix of chocolate and dark fruit with some alcohol then burnt and very bitter chocolate malt flavor took over, with just a hint of the fruit lasting. It was so bitter it was sort of metallic. Hints of coffee at the end. The medium body was kind of silky with fizzy carbonation and a slightly chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
1969,"2008-06-17",3.7,"Thanks to TheRealBastard for this nice bonus beer.  Pours dark brown/black with a fluffy khaki colored head that lasts a long time.  Aroma is quite nutty with some butterscotch, raspberry, toast, chocolate, espresso, licorice...this reallly offers a lot on the nose, especially as it warms a bit.  Flavor shows a bit more roast and coffee, caramel sweetness, a little licorice, charred wood, and some pleasant ""Belgian yeast"" style dried fruit.  Finishes with a lingering brown sugar sweet taste, coffee bitterness and burnt toast.  Vague fruit flavor too.  High carbonation, but never irritatingly so, medium bodied and definitely easy to drink.  It seems unfair to call this watery; I think its about where a 7.5% Belgian beer should be.

More of a stout then well anything Belgian style, although the palate was lighter, almost airy which ill admit doesnt fit the stout characteristics well for me.

1969,"2008-06-03",3.7,"Objectively speaking:
A fun example of this pleasant and rare Belgian stout style.

I like:
Very effective palate, authentic carbonation and malt structure. Appropriate roastiness level to avoid any astringency, yet cut through sweetness sufficiently. Sweet beginning, but relatively dry finish.

I dislike:
Not as much character as some to its yeastiness. Some esters manage to peak through, but it never reaches too far, no attempt is being made at integrating a trace of sourness etc  it is mostly limited to plain breadiness, thus losing a lot of its Belgian potential.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1969,"2008-06-01",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2008 My Bottom Line:
Fluffy roastiness delineates a yeasty fruitiness, as chocolatey opinions team up with minty spiciness to liven up this gentle and thoughtful Belgian-style Stout (whatever that means).

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the brownish black.
-The roasted malt provides some decent bitterness.
-The mouthfeel is authentically Belgian, classy and peacefully effervescent.
-The inherent spiciness is peppery at times as well.
-The fruit character developed by the yeast and the sugars recalls dates, at times.
-This seems to age quite well; more will have to be had (for scientific purposes, of course...)

This stout is carbonated a tad higher than I expected but it doesnt detriment to taste or palate.  Allagash has created a stout that reminds me a great deal of Lion Stout (Sri Lanka) but a tad sweeter.  As they claim there is a hint of roasted coffee and malt.  The oats smooth the body out nicely.  Its a tad sweet for my taste but Im willing to overlook that in light of the exceptional balance, complexity and uniqueness.

1969,"2008-03-28",4.2,"750ml caged&corked bottle. Pours a dark brown (almost black) that isnt quite opaque - it has ruby and deep brown highlights in the light. The foam pours up light tan and very thick and pillowy. It slowly fades to next to nothing. The aroma has lots of funky esters - pungent cherry, hints of sarsaparilla. The smell of alcohol is strong considering the beer is less than 8% abv. There are also roasty -almost meaty- notes, too. The flavor starts rich and roasty. It has almost ashen notes of roast that fade with each sip until it instead resembles a slight peppery mustiness combined with coffee. There is also a very pleasant residual sweetness that balances the bitter roasted grains nicely - like mildly sweetened coffee or dark/semi-sweet chocolate. By mid-palate, the esters come into play - funky fruit, hints of bubbles gum. All the while there is a nice dark roasted grain character - grainy yet espresso-smooth. The finish is surprisingly dry with a nice, earthy hop bitterness - and more roast with hints of burnt toast.

1969,"2008-03-28",3.4,"So after trading for this, it comes to San Diego, what gives?  Its life I guess.  I found this bottle at the mission valley Bev Mo.  Pours black with a 2 finger tan head.  Nose is malty and sweet and smokey with a bit of a burnt coffee feeling.  Taste is very much a roasted coffee feeling, with some burnt chocolate malt in there as well.  Its pretty interesting, I dont know what to call this for style, its decent but a bit too one dimensional for me.  Sadly a dissapointment from a Brewery who usually does no wrong.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
1969,"2008-03-27",3.7,"Pours with a frothy, initially three-finger thick, dirty, brown-tinged, tan colored head that slowly collapses into a dense, varied surface terrain.  The beer is a deep, burnt, concentrated amber color (almost, but not quite black color).  While mostly opaque, if held up to the light, flashes of ruby can be seen at times.  The aroma is quite roast dominated; aromatic notes of chocolate, charcoal, deeply toasted malt and even blackened whole-grain bread crust aromas.  A deep inspection of the nose yields notes of phenolic driven peat-smoke, burnt prunes and burnt wine notes too.  An interesting aroma, mostly roast dominated, but one gets hints of yeast character (fruit & phenolic notes), though these are fairly subtle at times.  After my second pour the nose starts to pick up some spicy aromatic notes that remind me faintly of cardamom & ginger.

Sweeter than I was expecting up front, though not overly so; this accentuates a flavor of sweet plums up front just before the roast character kicks in and washes over the palate.  The beer finishes with roast driven flavors of salty-smoky peat, a roasted acidity, flavors of burnt cocoa, a roasted bitterness and a substantial, darkly toasted grain not that lingers on in the palate.  The long finish also gets a touch phenolic with just a hint of warming alcohol to it as well.  Up front flavors of cocoa combine with the fruit flavors (raisin notes are here too).  The body is on the light side for a beer of this strength, though it is not down right thin like some super-attenuated Belgian beers are, instead this has a mild heft to it that seems to allow the smoky, cocoa & toasted notes to cling to the palate.  

As the beer warms up (60+°F / 15.6°C) the fruit notes become a touch more noticeable, though not any sweeter, and the roast character becomes much more rounded and rich tasting.  It really starts to open up and the yeast character becomes much more evident; there is nothing quite new, but the plum notes begin to pick up a bit of tartness and spicy notes of pepper & clove are added to the previously noticed, but now accented spice flavors.  The spice & phenolic notes begin to mix quite interestingly with the roast character towards the end of my second glass.

An interesting beer, the dark malt at times can overwhelm the softer yeast character, but I have a feeling that it contributes more than one might expect (probably adds to the smokiness of this brew).  On the other hand I was feeling like a roasty stout this evening, and this most definitely fits the bill (with a little added complexity & lighter body than one would typically find in one).  As the beer warmed it becomes more complex, which definitely helps my enjoyment.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Mildly sweet aroma, with sweet grapefruit, zest, dark candi, dark chocolate, mild roasted malt. Very dark chocolate flavors with hints of vanilla and licorice.

1969,"2008-03-16",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2008 On tap at Ebenezers. Ill start off by saying that this is sort of an odd beer, especially to be produced in America. Roasty and toasty throughout, but I really didnt get too much in the way of chocolatey stoutiness nor Belgiany fruitiness. Its not necessarily a problem that this beer doesnt seem to fall into any category, but I didnt find it to really create a nice niche for itself either. Mouthfeel also not strong in either the way of stout-solid or Belgian-silky. Again, overall I found it to be odd. (Not that I didnt enjoy it...) Further commentary posted 7/28/08...from bottle, rather heavy mouthfeel, nothing particularly interesting in the flavor, odd mesh of the bitterness and sweetness, no need to return.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

1969,"2008-03-09",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2008 Appearance: Pours a black body with an immense, frothy beige head.

Smell: Aroma saturated with the scent of Belgian yeast and roastiness and containing notes of mentholyptus, burnt wood, cocoa powder, and the juice of one lemon.

Taste: Bittersweet chocolate, dark caramel, and a dash of cola start things off with a restrained, rather brief sweetness. A pop of lemony acidity. Tastes of coffee, half a Halls Menthol cough drop, and a few chunks of smokey fire-charred wood follow. Medium bitterness. Plenty of yeast. Very dry finish leaves you with a lingering roasty, bitter herb aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Slight creaminess to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: A decent Belgian-minded stout from the folks at Allagash, though I didnt care for that herbal, mentholyptus-esque taste and aroma I kept running into even if it cured me off my nagging cough.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1969,"2008-03-05",3.7,"Sienna brown with a ruby glow around the rim; a firm head of tanned white.  Aroma is quiet, but complex, mostly of bakers chocolate, banana, and hazelnut; a lovely, strange sweetness of red bell pepper and citrus zest underneath.  Taste is velvety and soft with black licorice, caramel, espresso and lingonberries; hints of candied almonds and cherries.  A second series of flavors is juicy, meaty, and acidic; roast beef, lemon juice, and maple.  Palate is somewhat sandy and cola-like at first, but slowly relaxes into a more caressing texture of chilled red wine; medium in body.  Finishes with raspberry jam and honey; lengthy, wet and warm.  The initial impression is one of acrid mineral and nutty bitterness; mid palate is the highlight with a rich, intricate, and perfect balance of malt and yeast.  Sweetness prevails a bit too easily in the end.  Like many of Allagashs products, this recalls but doesnt live up to the greatness of its Belgian inspiration, which in this case as in others is probably De Dolle; still this is altogether a fine offering and an impressively delicate and generous representation of this difficult style.

1969,"2008-02-08",3.7,"The aroma was fruity with a roasty tone of espresso coffee and a dark chocolate note when first poured. The aroma contained some dark fruits, raisins and prunes, and a toasty character with caramel and a bit of spice.

The flavor was lightly roasty with espresso coffee and a menthol/herbal quality. The flavor had a spice presence of Belgian yeast which was notable, but not in the forefront. Chocolate was present but was also kept on the back burner. The flavor was malty with some caramel, but ultimately came to a dry finish with lasting herbal flavors into the aftertaste.

1969,"2008-01-28",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2009 I think this was from Dickinsonbeer and was shared at JoeMcPhees gathering,. Black bodied of course, with a small tan head. It seems like the airiness that the  Belgian yeast created gets in the way of the other aspects of the beer that otherwise would add nicely to the beer. These elements would be light chocolate and roast and some faint mineral and smoke. Taste is similarly light on everything, its just all too understated.  7/3/7/3/14A more civilized rating here.  Batch 8 poured into a Hobgoblin tulip.  Its not all that black actually, more like really thick and dark brown.  Tan head is still there though.  This is a weird beer, its got lots of elements but in general they just dont work for me.  And I actually forgot I rated this before and had the numbers in my head before I logged on here.  And apparently they are the same but for different reasons.  There is a salty characteristic that I do not like here.  It goes in hand with a light smoke, and while I love smoke this isnt rauch but maybe just the roast malts. Its weird for me.  In the aroma I also get some hops I do not like, not IPA/IIPA strength but stronger than I would like, an not in the traditional vain.  Flavor is that salty meat smoke thang that I am not all that happy about.  There is the roast and chocolate, yada, yada, yada that stouts have but that is not what makes the beer.  The beer isnt bad and it aims high (which is what makes Allagash so interesting) but it misses and in general becomes an average brew.  Above average for a beer but as far as ratings go its average.

If I were to close my eyes, this would strike me simply as a strong dark Belgian ale.  However, I must confess that Im not missing the stout qualities I had thought were going to be present.

1969,"2008-01-26",4.0,"750 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (January 2008) served at cellar temperature from a Maudite glass.  Smooth light tan medium-bubbled head fills over half the glass above the totally opaque ebody liquid dies fairly rapidly leaving little residue....light chocolaty, licorice-accented aroma, moderately roasty but mostly sweet, bready yeast character takes a little while to come out but adds some interest when it arrives....the body is at first sweet and lightly toasty, with full-on espresso bitterness arriving shortly, deeply and richly chocolaty with just a hint of dark grapes, rather burnt and perhaps a touch smoky at the finish....beautiful, typically Allagash silky mouthfeel despite the quite high carbonation, very light on the tongue given the potent flavor profile....excellent; were the nose more expressive it could be genius.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1969,"2008-01-26",3.9,"Deep brown color, slighly opaque around the edges and a nice, creamy tan head that lasts.  Roasty and coffee aroma.  Velvety mouthfeel and perfect carbonation.  Flavor is predominantly roasted malt, but there is also some coffee, milk chocolate, and floral hops towards the finish.  Finish is bitter, long and with lingering roasted malt notes.  I didnt catch any alcohol at all and that makes this a dangerously drinkable brew.","oxford, Georgia, USA","Hangover"
1969,"2008-01-25",3.9,"Bottle provided by IMtheOptimator.  Pours dark brown with a tan head.  Smells of bananas, coriander, cinnamon, lots of spiciness.  Tastes of lemons, pepper, lots of sweet malty undertones.  Not a stout by any stretch of the imagination but very enjoyable.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1969,"2008-01-25",3.8,"Cask at the Blind Tiger.  Black with a reddish hint, not thick looking though, with a thin film on top.  Aroma is burnt wood, roasted malt, maybe a little coffee / chocolate.  The flavor shows more sweet chocolate, burnt malt, and burnt coffee in the finish.  Palate is nice but a little watery.  Distinct brew.","San Mateo, California, USA","golubj"
1969,"2008-01-24",3.9,"Cask at Blind Tiger. Coffee and roasty aroma, hearty and cheesy, much bread and belgian yeasts. Dirty, muggy, foggy flavor, old coffee, with an oddly hoppy and paint thinner finish. Really, the finish is the only real flaw in this beer. It is supremely drinkable, especially on cask, and I finished the mug in 4 large sips. Very unique and different. I enjoyed this a good bit.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1969,"2008-01-24",3.9,"Cask at Blind Tiger.  Deep black beer with a creamy light brown head.  Very soft carbonation (I suspect this is completely unlike the bottle, FWIW).  Aroma is fairly chocolatey initially with some fruity plums, raisins and a prominent yeasty character.  Spicy with a bit of herbal flavour, light coffeeish character as well.  Fairly vineous with a grapey sweetness, clove and a hint of cocoaish flavour.  Raisiny sweetness on the back before a soft roastiness before a lovely yeasty spiciness.  Fairly rich with a hint of raisiny sweetness, light licorice toastiness.  Quite a lovely brew.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1969,"2008-01-24",3.4,"Cask at Blind Tiger.  Pours black with a moderate amount of off-white head.  I can smell the beer just from holding it regularly.  Lots of roasted malts and coffee.  The atse starts off pretty well with roasted malts being the key player, but for whatever reason, it all just falls apart from there.  Im not even sure how to describe it.  I think the coffee managed to get burnt while on my tongue.  The palate was slightly watery and the finish brought the burnt coffee again.  Sadly, letting this beer sit for a bit didnt help it much.  I should probably give this another try out of the bottle, though I wont be paying for it.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
1969,"2008-01-23",3.7,"Dark brown/black body with a medium-sized tan head. Rich chocolate nose with molasses, raisins and toffee. The flavor is lightly sweet with roast, milk chocolate, molasses, prunes and ash. Medium/full body is soft with light carbonation.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
1969,"2008-01-22",3.6,"750 split two ways.  Black in color with a large tan/light brown head.  Aroma is yeasty with the trademark allagash phenolics, as well as roast, chocolate, light touches of earth.  Taste is roasty, with a good amount of yeasty must and phenolics, bittersweet chocolate, earth, and floral hops.  Light to medium bodied, carbonation somewhat prickly on the palate.  Well done for a belgian style stout.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
1969,"2008-01-22",3.9,"Very intriguing flavors.  Dark but mellow, with a velvety mouthfeel and cocoa powder background notes.  Nice creamy head, too.  A fine brew, if not just a hair too sweet.  Not worth the cost, however.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"

1969,"2008-01-21",4.0,"750ml bottle from Lous in Augusta.  Pours a virtually opaque black body with a half inch of tan head.  Smoked malts dominate the aroma with slight citrus notes.  Roasted malts come on strong initially, with bitter coffee/dark chocolate bordering on ashey and a slight smokey notes in the background.  Not quite astringent with moderate carbonation and a full body.  Fairly smokey toward the finish.  Not bad.  Not quite what I was expecting, but interesting and unlike anything Ive had in many ways.  Alcohol is well-hidden and that with the mouthfeel make this an easier drinker than some beers half as strong.  Pretty good.","Derry, New Hampshire, USA","BigBen2120"
1969,"2008-01-20",3.8,"On tap at the bricstore.  Nice roasted malt aromas and flavors bordering on the chocolate side of things.

1969,"2008-01-20",3.8,"The fizzy light tan head disperses rather quickly from this dark brown ale.  The nose is greeted first by the hops, pine and floral, followed by some rich roasted dark malts, bittersweet chocolate, and my Moms old coffee.  Its medium bodied with just a bit too much carbonation, in my humble estimation.  Still, the flavors from the scents from the nose carry well into the taste of the Stout, the hoppy bitterness increasing somewhat, and a bit of aniseed and smokiness join the fray.  Over all, a very decent brew.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Wine & Spirits, Downers Grove, IL<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"

1969,"2008-01-19",4.1,"Bottle. Notes of chocolate and candy aroma (burnt caramel?), rounded off with a strong malt aroma. Dark brown in color with reddish hues and an off white/tan head. Flavors were nice, a balance of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts.  Medium bodied, slightly too much carbonation at first but it has a very nice dry coffee(slight) finish. Overall this a really good beer and I think aging will improve this beer. The carbonation and strong alcohol feel is a bit overpowering at times. I hope it will mellow a bit with age. Good offering by Allagash.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","cdog69"
1969,"2008-01-18",3.8,"Bottle from porterhouse and served in my Expedition snifter, THANKS! Nearly opaque with some reddish highlights at the top and bottom topped by a fading frothy head and left spotty lace upon the glass. The aroma has notes of sharp black patent and chocolate malt, oatmeal, some resiny hops, hint of fig and plum esters, burnt candi sugar, and coffee vapours. A very aggressive (but nice) nose on this beer which should mellow through time.  The taste starts with equal amounts of sweet malt, sugar, fruit and chocolate. The finish slows more of the bitter notes of hop and coffee with a dash of smoky tones. I am happy than there is NOT a funky sourness with this that is found often in Belgian Styled Stouts. Well I like that in JP version I dont think it would have fit here. The mouth feel is sprite and sharp which cleanse the palate well. Could be a touch thicker but still works for me. Overall I like this beer and would like to see one with 6-12 months age on it.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

A little disappointing for Allagash.","USA","ElGaucho56"

The aroma is wheaties dipped in dark chocolate syrup, raisins, figs, mild funk, and mild hops and spice.  The taste was dark malty, with some chocolate and cinnamon noted, plus figgy fruit and finishing hops.  I call this a mild disappointment, as I was expecting a bit more, and I didnt notice the coffee aroma or flavor that others seem to have.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

1969,"2008-01-05",4.2,"Pours a dark chocolate color with a slight tan head that quickly settles down.  The huge impact this beer made is its really good dry finish.  At first i served this too cold, but as it warmed a bit the flavors really popped out.  Coffee, toffee, and a dark malt taste and aroma dominate.  Mouthfeel is superb.  The best thing about this beer is that its something VERY different from what ive tried from Allagash recently.  I strongly applaud this offering from them.

Taste is more coffee, big roasted malts, dark chocolate and sweet malts. Light dark fruit notes. Perhaps like a chocolate covered fruit. Its there but its more of a underground flavor. Body is chewy and medium-full with a strong carbonation feel. Feels heavier and thicker than it is. Finishes with more roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate and sweet malts. Very candyish at times but then very bitter. Here there also seems to be more dark fruit notes but they are still ever so slight. Again the chocolate covered fruit comes to mind. At times I get slight melon notes during the finish. Nice beer, nonetheless.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1969,"2007-12-25",3.7,"Pours a brown tinted black, decent head fades away entirely.  Aroma is coffee, a bit of chocolate liquor, and a tangy Belgian yeast note that brings to mind some other Allagash beers.  Alcohol clearly present.  Rather light on the palate, the initial flavor is a bit of chocolate and a whole bunch of dark fruit.  Bit of anise as well.  This changes significantly as it warms, going from initial chocolate and hint of coffee into a fruity, yeasty, clearly Belgian influenced brew.  Interesting.  Hopefully the alcohol will integrate a touch better as it ages, as it was a touch disjointed in my opinion.  But still rather unique and enjoyable in its take on the style.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1969,"2007-12-24",3.5,"Not as impressive as I wanted it to be.  Allagash makes many fine fine ales, this is just not one the best.  Cloying candied nose that works well as a stout-smell, reminiscent of nothing, and thats a nice thing.  However, the taste is simple, despite a long aftertaste that overcoats the tongue and tonsils.  Unique and should be tried by many however, and yet another example as to why Allagash is one of the most exciting breweries in the US, not just the east cost.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
