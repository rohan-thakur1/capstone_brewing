So lucky, as this is not one of the Smuttynoses that one finds in regular beer stores in the places I get to go. I knew about its fame, as USAs best-rated Baltic Porter. It is certainly among the best. Wonderful nose of berries, very vinous, sweet cherries, some tartness, dried fruit, liquorice and even a touch of dark chocolate. Great start. The beer pours very dark brown to be onyx black in the glass, with a decent brown head, not as creamy as perfection would dictate, but still formidable. Flavours of dark bitter chocolate, prunes, tart cherries, salty liquorice and fudge, quite smoothly sweet, vinous as the aroma and hardly any sourness. A bit of an export stout bitterness, with soy sauce and ketjap manis with the prunes. The bitterness is strong but well embodied in the beer. Not grassy, nor roasty. Flavours not layered, but well-rounded into a unique result. Incredibly well crafted. Full bodied, it is as oily as one would like for a Baltic Porter. Excellent stuff! Long chase finally over.

1789,"2016-05-19",3.9,"This beer has been a while in my cellar, so if tought it will lose alcohol aroma and some body. Maybe it needed more time?
The appearance is quite dissapointing. Color is great - beer is almost opaque black, only on the bottom of the glass there are some brown reflexes. Head retention is problematic - nice, thick foam disapeared in few moments. In aroma there are tones of sweet chocolate and cherries. Alcohol is present, but it smells like cherry tincture. Everything is completed with notes of roasty, coffee-like aroma with hints of soy sauce. In mouth beer gives as everything that nose announced: chocolate, cherry, alcohol warming, coffee, soy sauce. Roast malt character is different - in taste it gives delicate ashy feeling. Mouthfeel is great! Long finish with a lot of sugarry sweetness changing over time to alcoholic bitterness.

Podsumowanie:  

Bałtycki Porter Numer 3 na świecie według RateBeer.
Uwarzony przez amerykański browar Smuttynose z Hampton, New Hampshire.

Świetny Bałtycki Porter. Jestem fanem Porteru Bałtyckiego z Pinty i uważam że jest odrobinę lepszy od tego. Ten jednak jest również bardzo smaczny.
To co najbardziej mi w nim imponuje to jego gęstość - wprost niebywała, kremowość i gładkość.
Bogactwo smakowe jest tniekończące się i każdy łyk dostaracza kolejnych wrażeń.
Polecam każdemu kto chce sprawdzić jak smakuje wyznacznik stylu.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

En bouche le liquide est juste assez rond et moelleux sans toutefois être riche et sirupeux. Mes papilles et mon palais saccordent pour une expérience bien plus maltée que fruitée. En effet les grains bien rôtis libèrent une amertume plutôt sèche, laquelle ne provient pas des houblons qui demeurent présents et apportent un heureux équilibre.

Appearance: nearly black but with faint traces of brown. Topped by a moderate size, creamy/sudsy, light brown head than reduces to a ring and some islands all too quickly. Still able to leave lacing on the glass. 

Smell: Lots of chocolate for a beer without any actual cocoa; also dark malt and dark fruits, with a hint of coffee. Smells sweet. 

Taste: Chocolate, coffee, raisins, dark roasted malts and dark fruit flavors are all quite evident in this very flavorful beer. Despite the coffee component and some hop flavor, the brew is only mildly bitter. 

Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth full body. Medium carbonation, perhaps a bit higher than expected, imparts some liveliness.

1789,"2015-09-30",4.0,"Bottle conditioned in January, 2015.
This was poured into an English pint glass.
The appearance was a pure dark jet black pour. A slight one and a half finger white to off white foamy head dissipated within less than a minute. Lacing just quickly slides into the beer.
The smell starts off with sweet rich dark chocolate with a nice leading edge of some dark fruits coming in lightly to keep it sweet. Light bitter and roasty coffee beans show some nice balance to boot in the aroma.
The taste follows through in the previously noted aromas. The lager yeast helps a tad little bit of breadiness to make a smooth transition to the aftertaste and give off a sly little bit of semi-sweet sticky little bit of a finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs really light causing a big stickiness to develop and surround my tongue.
Overall, I say this was a really nice Baltic Porter, maybe I just could have had it at the right time too. It really aged nicely!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Certo, la birra è bella e nera come la notte, bella profonda. Inizialmente, ma io lho lasciata raffreddare troppo, porta al naso un bel profumo di prugna. Questo apre laroma, ma si lascia seguire da vaniglia, latte, leggermente la liquirizia. In secondo piano, invece, le tostature con il sentore dellorzo sul punto di ebollizione presente. Aroma vario, abbastanza intenso e che sopratutto predispone nel migliore dei modi la bevuta. Limbocco è molto dolce. Inizialmente, si avverte il sapore della componente dolce, molta vaniglia, che però trova subito un buon equilibrio, con i malti tostati, tipo orzo, che bilanciano subito la bevuta. è solo un intervallo però, perché si sento poi la frutta disidratata. penso alla prugna, ma anche il dattero devo dire. è una birra che gioca bene sullequilibrio, parte dolce ma viene smorzata dallamaro, non bruscamente ma dolcemente. Quando sembra chiudere amara, in maniera noiosa poi, si ripresenta dolce, richiamando una dolcezza palatale molto pronunciata. Non è secca alla fine, quindi, ma è piacevole. Morbida, ha una carbonatazione media ed al palato non è particolarmente avvolgente. Un peccato, forse, perché una maggiore sensazione vellutata forse avrebbe reso la birra ancora più interessante. Ma si tratta di una baltic porter, quindi credo sia abbastanza in linea con lo stile. Nel retrogusto ritorna anche la vaniglia, ma è tutta la componente dolce che si ripresenta. Non è mai stucchevole, però. E questo, credo sia un punto vantaggiosissimo.","ITALY","Fashawn"

Delightful, especially for this style, which is usually less lush and complex. Typical American craft brewery take on the style, Id argue.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1789,"2014-09-01",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 3-8-13-

Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a deep brown nearly black color with a one finger tan head. The head fades slowly over time to leave a great level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is heaviest of dark fruits of raisin, cherry and prune with a roasted malt and chocolate aroma. Mixed with these stronger smells are notes of toffee and caramel as well as a warming alcohol smell. Quite delicious.

 Taste  The taste begins heavy of toasted malt, chocolate, and a caramel sweetness. The caramel takes on more of a toffee like flavor more toward the middle along with some flavors of fig and raisin hitting the tongue. The sweeter flavors fade ever so slightly as some light coffee flavors and a bit of a boozy taste comes to the tongue. More bitter sweet chocolate comes to the tongue at the end along with a light smokiness leaving a nice darker and toasted flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the beer was thick and creamy with a lower to average level of carbonation. The thicker body was fantastic for all the dark roasted flavors of the brew really allowing all the subtle (as well as the not so subtle) darker flavors to linger and be detected by the tongue.

 Overall  Quite a delicious brew. Medium sweetness with a thick body and a nice roasted flavor profile. A very nice cool weather sipping brew.","","Darkmagus82"
1789,"2014-07-14",4.4,"It has a slow thick pour which is very dark. In the glass it looks nearly opaque and black in color. On top there is a tall light brown head. The head has good retention and leaves some splotchy lacing on the glass. The aroma has sweet and roasty maltiness. Its bready and grainy with hints of dark fruit and noticeable alcohol. There is a lot of full bodied sweet dark roasted barley malt wrapped up with some mellow boozy alcohol. There are notes of chocolate, dark dried fruits, golden raisons, burnt sugar and dark/burnt toasted bread. The finish has some leafy hop flavor and mild bitterness creeping in for some balance. Overall it still has plenty of residual sweetness in the end. Its not overpowering or cloying at all but it will slow down the drinkability as it lets you know its a big beer.

I am not sure how I have not rated this in the last few years. Somebody was nice enough to send a bottle so it was time to get it out of the way. Between the style and the brewery I had decent expectations. This did not disappoint; while there might be better ones on the market few are as accessible and affordable.

Aroma / Appearance - The oily black base is like melted chocolate ready for truffles. A mocha sandy head bubbles on top with a thickness so heavy you could almost sleep on it. Plums, chocolate, and sweet licorice brighten the air. The smoky undertones are a bit like dry rub just before it is put on the grill.

Flavor / Palate - Plums, figs, bacon, and melted anise drops warm the throat. A smoky feel reminds me of sitting in a cigar bar. Chewy with a sweet bite this has a great presence. Ive probably had better baltic porters but this was far from difficult to finish off in a single sitting.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1789,"2013-01-13",3.9,"2010 bottle. 
Aroma has some roast and chocolate but also has quite a bit of vinous dark fruit to the aroma and some sherry aromas. The dark fruit is mostly prune but also a hint of raisin. Low alcohol aroma, but it is present. 
Pours black with hints of brown on the edges. A thick light mocha head that steadily recedes. Very faint lacing and mid sized legs. 
Flavor hits right away with sweet milk chocolate. There are secondary roast notes with hints of coffee and tobacco. The fruit esters are lighter in the flavor but there is still some prune and raisin in the finish. Low astringency and medium bitterness. Light alcohol bite in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium full to full bodied with quite a bit of creaminess to it. The astringency is low but present and the alcohol warmth is medium to medium high. 
Overall this is a very enjoyable Baltic porter though possibly not to style. The roast character isn't as strong as I would expect and instead its got tons of chocolate. This beer probably has reached the max of how long it can safely be aged. I'm not sure it could handle another year without becoming a sherry bomb.

A: Pours a very dark brown color body. The head is a three finger light tan color with impressive retention and lacing.

S: Strong roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit - a textbook smell, but a great one.

T: This has one of the most immensely bold roast profiles Ive ever encountered; actually this is one of the most in your face tasting beers Ive ever had. The huge roastiness does transition to chocolate and licorice after a while, while the finish sees a surge of dark fruit to go with the big roast. Wow, this has so much flavor, and it has solid balance, to boot.

M: This has a medium body with good carbonation and dryness. The aftertaste is loaded with long-lasting dark fruit and roast, and the alcohol isnt very noticeable on the palate and body.

O: Heres the thing. Its amazingly flavorful, but theres so much flavor that it hinders its drinkability somewhat.

1789,"2012-08-11",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2012 2012 Bottle Date; Sampled August 2012
The beer pours into my Lost Abbey Teku glass with a four finger thick, brown tinged, concentrated tan colored head that leaves lots of lacing as it settles. The beer is a simple, opaque, black color. A huge cocoa liquor aroma jumps out of the glass and is joined by sweet coffee notes, a slightly chalky character (though definitely in a good way), roasted burnt nutty notes, burnt brown sugar aromatics, an almost rum like character, as well as an oaky character somehow, and even notes that remind me of burnt brandy somehow. There is also a huge, toasted / roasted whole grain character to the nose.

The beer tastes sweet, but not cloying as it is easily balanced by lots of roasted character. Bitter roast notes mix with bitter hop notes in the finish. This has a huge, smooth, cocoa / dark chocolate character to it in the flavor, as well as notes of coffee liquor, and lots of roasted nutty notes. The body is much lighter than the robust flavor would suggest; this is not overly light in character, as it still has some heft to it as well as some viscousnous. This has really nice roast profile, it is quite smooth though, but certainly pronounced; the combination of bitter, burnt, and roast really defines the profile.

This is really nice, it is much better than I expected, and it is a very enjoyable surprise. Definitely dont dump in the sediment from the bottom of the bottle, it makes the beer hot and alcohol expressive; luckily I didnt sully my clean pour with the sediment. Simply awesome.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

My nose detected rich burnt coffee beans, dark chocolate and an Irish Peat Bog in the aroma, a fine mix at nine in the morning.

The nose shows really appetizing characters of chocolate milk, dark chocolate, and a slight roast note; along with a background note of Munich and perhaps a medium lovibond crystal malt.  Any hop character has long fallen out of solution.  The palate shows much of what was advertised in the aroma, with a touch more emphasis on roasted character.  Milk chocolate, mellow roasted flavors, a nice residual caramel/toasted malt sweetness, and a finish that is absolutely surprising in its dryness.  Again, hop bitterness seems nonexistent, indicating that the alcohol may be adding a touch of bitterness, along with the roasted malt.

Head retention and lacing are both pretty good.  Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, caramel and dark fruit.  I think the brew tastes just like the aroma, but with the roasted malt, dark fruit and coffee flavors being the strongest.  Mouthfeel/body is full, its creamy and rich with moderate carbonation.  The drinkability is amazing, its very smooth and goes down quite easy.  The 9% ABV isnt noticable at all in the aroma or taste, which also helps make this beer easy to drink.

The head was somewhat thin and sparse, but a pretty brown color. The head retention wasnt too impressive, and the carbonation wasnt too strong,  but for a porter I wont complain.

1789,"2010-09-25",3.8,"2009 bottle, website says bottled in early November so this is almost a year old and I just bought it off the shelf for a great price ;).  Pours a nice shinny dark near black cola with a fizzy foamy light tan froth.  Good amount of hop oxidation in the aroma, pine needles and the likes which make me want their imperial stout that I loved, nice round dark roast, thick and very dark, bit of the fruit that I love to find, just too much hop oxidation in the way, not sure if it would be better fresher or after another year or two.  Flavor follows, dry roast upfront, oxidized pinny hops, bit of fruit and rich oily dark chocolate in the finish leading to a alcohol burn that ruins the experience a bit.  Medium/full bodied, creamy and chalky with spritzy carbonation, actually dry for the style, as it warms carbonation becomes more fluffy, so odd because it is dry and yet creamy and fluffy at the same time .  So far didnt quite do it for me like the impy stout did, this doesnt have the refinement a lagered big porter should have.  Definitely better as it as warmed, little bit more of the lagered character, round fruitiness, but still the harsh roast and aggressive hops combined with the showing alcohol just diminish what really could be a world class baltic porter, pretty delicious but just a bit out of sorts, duck rabbit, flossmoor and others nudge this one out.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Appearance: It has a slow thick pour which is very dark. In the glass it looks nearly opaque and black in color. On top there is a tall light brown head. The head has good retention and leaves some splotchy lacing on the glass. 

Smell: The aroma has sweet and roasty maltiness. Its bready and grainy with hints of dark fruit and noticeable alcohol. 

Taste/Palate: There is a lot of full bodied sweet dark roasted barley malt wrapped up with some mellow boozy alcohol. There are notes of chocolate, dark dried fruits, golden raisons, burnt sugar and dark/burnt toasted bread. The finish has some leafy hop flavor and mild bitterness creeping in for some balance. Overall it still has plenty of residual sweetness in the end. Its not overpowering or cloying at all but it will slow down the drinkability as it lets you know its a big beer. On the tongue it has a slick viscose feel. There is just enough carbonation to ease it over the palate.

1789,"2009-10-11",4.2,"Roasted punch everywhere.  This beer is perhaps the best example of an American-made strong porter.  Smuttynose, the most underrated craft brewer on the east coast.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
1789,"2009-10-09",3.7,"(bottle from ditmier, thanks!) Pours black with a medium tan head that reduces to a thin ring around the snifter.  The aroma is initially not all that great, with some scents of creamed corn, mocha, and roasted malt.  As this warmed however, the aroma opens up and yields scents of dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, and cherry.  There is some booze as well, but not enough to detract from the other scents.  Further warming intensifies the chocolate and coffee, with some smoke and vanilla showing up as well.  The taste is pretty simple, with chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malt, and a bit of raisin, but really nothing else.  Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is decent, and the finish is lightly roasted.  Thanks again Eric!","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
1789,"2009-10-03",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2011 Re-rate of 2009 vintage with over a year of additional age.  Dunno if it was the age, the previous bottle, or my palate, but Im much more impressed with this beer now than I originally was.
Served at cellar temperature.  Pours dark brown/black with a big foamy and frothy brown head that leaves some clumps of lacing and recedes to a wispy island and ring.  Aroma is a perfect blend of rich chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts with dark fruits of cherries, raisins, figs and black currants.  Some vanilla and a touch of oxidation round things out.  Excellent strength.  Flavor is chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, cherries, raisins, black currants, some vanilla, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and very little alcohol presence.  Moderate sweetness.  Very bold and robust flavor.  Mouthfeel is creamy, medium to full bodied, with medium carbonation.  Probably the best American-brewed Baltic Porter Ive had to date.  Cant wait for this years batch to come out!

Bomber bottle, 2009.  Pours very dark brown, nearly black, with a nice half-inch brown head.  Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and a touch of sour milk.  Flavor is chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, with hints of dark fruits and vanilla.  Alcohol bite is noticeable.  Full, creamy mouthfeel, medium carbonation.  Baltic Porters are one of my favorite styles, and while this is an excellent example, I feel it is a bit over-rated.  Sinebrychoff (Koff) Porter is superior.  Duck-Rabbits is very good, but inconsistent.  Ive only had this one Smuttynose Baltic Porter, so I cannot commend on its consistency.  Every Sinebrychoff Ive had has been exactly the same, and is, IMHO, the best Baltic Porter out there.

1789,"2009-09-29",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2013 Wow, this was one hell of a brew.  In my memory this serves as the definitive example of a perfect  head, color, and lacing in a beer.  A rich dark brown head I dont see very often.  Aroma is of intense chocolate and coffee.  The flavor also tastes of these two wonderful dark roasts along with additional maltiness and sweetness.  I will have it again, and the rating may even get bumped up (Flavor 10/10???)

Update 9/2/13 (four years later):  The head is a medium, warm brown which is noticeably dark for the brown color of the beer  The head plumes upward 2,3,4 inches filling half the glass and remaining - great appearance.  The flavor/aroma is malt-milkshake, chocolate, with a bit of soy sauce, but this is balanced by some light roasty notes to keep things pleasant.  Some biscuity notes as well.  It lives up to my memory - I would probably have given it a 4.1 nowadays, but I will keep the original 4.3 because its impossible to know for sure.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"

1789,"2009-09-13",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This Baltic Porters complex malt display showcases biscuits, coffee beans, crunchy dark chocolate and roastiness in an elegant mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the brown-lined blackness.
-This is yet another Smuttynose brew in which malt flavors are superbly extracted.
-This is very drinkable for its size; the residual sugars are kept in check while still displaying enough of their sweetness to be pleasurable.
-I honestly didnt expect anything less from this, one of the best malt-driven breweries in eastern America.

Flavour: All of the above with a touch of pen ink (which I guess is obligatory in all American stouts and porters?) but also no soy sauce! Yeah! Toffee, and a touch of raisin. A sublte grainy hint is a very nice touch. More sweet than bitter, as one would expect from the style. Very much an American interpretation of a European classic, very well done.

1789,"2009-01-09",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2012 In short: A simple but very effective highly roasted and very chocolaty stout/porter
How: Bottle 22oz, consumed when about 8 months of age.  Sent to me by Cretus.
The look: Black body topped by a small tan head
In long: Very full body.  Roasted level is very high, a lot of black chocolate (the kind with very high cacao %).  Almost nothing in the way of fruity flavours except maybe a little dried figs.  The high roastiness provides a dry sensation.  No alcohol presence.  Far from complex but very pleasant.  I usually prefer my stouts/porters (or any other beers) with more complexity and subtleties but this Baltic Porter is quite effective.  Sometimes basic and straightforward is the way to go.

Intense sweet malty aroma of dark fruit, very dark chocolate, coffee, char, pehaps raisin. Nice. Mouthfeel initially has too much fizziness. Deeper into the bottle this begins to dissipate. Lightly oily and perhaps a touch thin. Taste is quite charry initially with lots of dark chocolate. Fair bit of alcohol in finish. Also the first several quaffs finished quite grassy but this seemed to eventually dissipate as well. As it warms there is more dark fruit and some coffee but still quite dominated by the chocolate and char.

Good balance between the hop profile and malt backbone.  Good viscosity which gave a nice sensation for the mouthfeel.  Very nice representation of a baltic porter and another solid offering by Smuttynose.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"
1789,"2008-09-12",3.9,"Not bad, but also not necessarily ""big,"" although I guess there’s no arguing with 8.7%.  Pours black, but a bit thin.  Head is medium sized, with medium staying power.  Aroma is a bit mercaptan-like, with some cotton candy, sweet vineous, and some grainy aroma.  Flavor is dry and roasty with some sweetness.  Flavor is predominantly dry and roasty, with some chocolate notes.  Flavor really lingers in your mouth; the dryness is very persistent.  Mouthfeel is a weird - a bit thin and sticky at the same time, which seems contradictory but is true.

Pours deep black with a small, creamy, beige, film head. Aroma has soft chocolate, lightly vinious with notes of vanilla and cocoa. Okay mouthfeel, but gets a bit too fat and oily for its own good. Very vinious flavour, almost burning. Hard roasted with weak chocolate notes. Again, I get a very underwhelming Smuttynose.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

Coffee, raisins, tar, chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of soy in the aroma--sorry to list, but this was a big conglomeration of the above, with maybe a hint of piney hops--quite tasty.  Flavor continued with most of everything and some light flower petals.  Not too sweet, and not overly bitter--though it does lean a bit towards the sweet side.   A little more ash in the finish than I wouldve liked--still a little piney and dry, with a bit of alcohol noted.  Full body with moderate carbonation.

1789,"2008-06-22",3.7,"22oz. Bottle. 2008 batch. Baltic porter is a great style of beer that isnt seen too often and this is a good one.  The beer pours an opaque black with a very thin tan head.  The head doesnt last long, but the carbonation is just about perfect, a few bubbles remain on the tongue in the finish.  The beer smells of chocolate and coffee with the flavors being similar, but with a slightly burnt quality.  Tastes like this beer has an impressive grain bill with substantial quantities of chocolate malt.  The mouthfeel is rich, but not syrupy.  Piney hops are noticeable and create a sharp bitterness that blends well with the espresso characteristics of the beer.

1789,"2008-06-12",3.7,"22 oz. bottle purchased at Capones in Norristown, PA.  Bottle Conditioned in 2008 according to the label.  Pour is opaque black, with a dense 2 inch tan head.  Small (audible) carbonation bubbles rise to the surface of the head as it settles.  Nice lacing left behind as the head fell slowly.  Aroma of roasted coffee grounds, tobacco and some faint pine hoppiness.  Taste represents the nose well, though the pine hoppiness is much more pronounced, with a decided bitterness to it.  The start is sharp malted barley roastiness, the middle reveals the earthy smoky tobacco, and the finish is the crisp and bitter hops.  As it warms, a bit of dark chocolate sweetness is picked up.  Also some licorice. The palate is medium, which works well to position this beer as a Baltic Porter.  Overall, this was a tasty, complex, easy to drink brew.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Clean, malt forward flavors up front on the palate, brimming with dark chocolate and silky coffee, adding a nice dark depth without any excessive roast.  Mid-palate, some fired raisin and plum fruity notes come through, all the while maintaining the malt focus of the beer.  Warming alcohol in the finish, along with a kiss of hop bitterness to dry up the rich palate.

Another eccentric label drawing by Smuttynose.  Strong alcohol in the nose, with some sharp hops and yeast also - maybe even a touch of mold?  The flavor packs a wallop, and comes in somewhere between an imperial stout and an imperial porter.  It is definitely the most potent thing I have tasted out of Portsmouth - coffee, roast grains, a touch of figs and dates, and a little whiskey too.

A big hit of chocolate malts is accented with coffee in the slightest amount.  this is huge since I have been raving on the over use of coffee as an ingredient as of late.  It actually works in this beer.

1789,"2008-04-08",3.7,"2008 bomber.  Poured clear, very deep browh with a short-lived cap of dark tan head.  The aroma was sweet and desserty, and I really dug that.. roasted sweeter chocolates pair with lighter-roast coffee, deeper vinous fruit, and tobacco.. there was also some licorice right at the back.  The flavor had a hefty complement of burnt darker malts (semi-sweet chocolate, licorice, and coffee) along with what seemed like dry cardboardey oxidation, ash, and char.. warmer finish with a lot of coffee bitterness, charred coffee, and dark fruit.. this grew on me as the drink progressed.  Heavier-bodied with higher carbonation on the palate.. charred and warm with decent balance (some boozy, sticky licorice at the very end struck me the wrong way).. overall very solid.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Very nicely done brew, a tad thin and milk-chocolatey on the flavor / mouthfeel, the only features that kept this from soaring on the second go-around. Yum! Bottle SL. Pour was dark brown almost black. The aroma was firm roast, strong chocolate, oats and other grains. The flavor followed the aroma, lots of robust porter notes, some faint bubblegum in the background, not sure I get all the Baltic porter notes. Mouthfeel was moderate for the style, strong roasted presence, dried up hops in the finish. Decent shot by Smutty, but not my fav of theirs.","","User37895"

The nose is very roasty with that classic licorice note I want in a Baltic.  Coffee, chocolate, char, minimal noticable hops.  A little nuttiness.  The flavor is much like the aroma, roasty, chocolaty, slight sweetness up front, bitter dark chocolate.  Finishes with a slight burnt chalkiness that covers the sweetness well.

This is a true Baltic, as the massively malty nose clearly indicates.  Big notes of bittersweet chocolate, dark caramel, cocoa nibs, and roasted coffee mean serious business.  A mildly earthy hop character comes through a little, but make no mistake, this one is malt dominant.  The flavor is again huge and intensely roasted, with rich, smooth, chocolaty and caramelized malts.  Medium-full bodied and silky smooth, this one goes down easy and finishes with lingering roast.  This is right up there with the best that this style has to offer.  Fantastic.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Thankfully, the rubbing alcohol was not in the flavor, which I enjoyed.  Very malty with coffee and tobacco noted as well.

1789,"2008-02-21",4.1,"Poured an opaque brown color with a small, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, light smoke, pine, and floral hops.  Taste of more smoke, chocolate, roast, dark fruits, raisins, and vanilla, with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1789,"2008-02-21",4.2,"Draft at BT. Great burnt malt aroma with rich, quality chocolate and tons of bitterness and a sturdy head. Flavors both hoppy and roasty with dry cocoa in the finish. I hope this beer finds its way into every beer lovers hands because it FUCKIN ROCKS!","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1789,"2008-02-19",4.1,"Pitch black.  Chocolate and coffee in the form of chocolate liqueur and espresso.  A distinct licorice aspect dominates in the flavor as well.  Quite good.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
1789,"2008-02-18",4.2,"Near black, with what appears to be a hint of ruby. Huge thick, lasting dark khaki foam with nice lace. Tropical fruit mix with chocolate malt, hint of tar, dates, treacle, sweet espresso and light wintergreen. Aroma seems a bit green, but its quite interesting. Big sweet toasted and roasted malt flavors. Hints of lactose. As in the nose an herbal hops component. Some peat and lightly earthy coffee as well. Slick and smooth in feel. Im trying to think how it could improve in feel and I cant come up with anything. Finish is dry with some sweet licorice and tar. Linger gets sweeter with a return to some sticky malt and a touch of hops and bit of pine. Good stuff.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1789,"2008-02-18",4.0,"Pours a very dark black.  Aromas of chocolate, roast, woodsmoke, and dried fruit.  Full mouthfeel with dominant coffee flavors.  Very dry finish.  Theres an initial burst of plummy, vinuous fruit which is quickly overwhelmed by the coffee.  I cant complain too much, but I would have liked less malts and more of the fruit.  Still, an exceptional porter.  One of my favorite styles.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"
1789,"2008-02-17",3.8,"22 oz bottle.  Rich unfiltered black beer.  Thick dark brownish head.  The aroma is quite authentic initially, sweet salty roasted barley, dark chocolate and a bittersweet toasted character.  Behind the sweet/toasted malt character is a fairly distracting DMS-like cooked vegetable flavour.  Otherwise, it is rich and chocolatey with a lot of bitter chocolate, salted roast and soft lean malts.  Some coffeeish flavour on the back.  Its got some very good points about it, but there are also some serious flaws.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1789,"2008-02-17",4.7,"Wow! poured jet black with a nice tan frothy head. Notes of coffee,mocha,and roasted malt. Coats your mouth and is very drinkable. Much better then Victorys baltic imo.","back in NJ!, New Jersey, USA","imadeadguy"
1789,"2008-02-17",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2008 Courtesy mgumby10. Pours pitch black, with a watery and slightly creamy tan head. Nice lacing. Aroma is roasted espresso and sweet chocolate. I like where this is going. Roasted malts, warming chocolate, and some slight alcohol. Surprisingly a bit thin-bodied. Like this one a lot.","Tampa, Florida, USA","gunhaver"
1789,"2008-02-17",1.9,"22 oz. brown bomber. No freshness date seen. Slightly contaminated. Produced a gusher when opened. Poured (gushed more like it) out a deep chocolate brown, with a huge tan head. Over carbonated to the max.
Aromas are licorice & not much else. Burnt malts in the flavors. Not that good a beer. Maybe Ill re-rate it when I can find an uncontaminated bottle.","","Cobra"
1789,"2008-02-17",4.2,"Courtesy Dickinsonbeer.  Thanks Paul!  Pours black, with a creamy off white head.  Smells of big roasty toasted malts, with a lighter chocolate influence.  Smells pretty inviting.  The flavor is much of th same, as the roasty malts and nuts make up most of its flavor characters.  The chocolate was there for moral support.  Very nicely balanced, great flavor.  Had a touch of some coffee in there too.  Another great offering from Smutty.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
1789,"2008-02-16",4.2,"Bomber bottle from Brent and enjoyed in my Stone IRS snifter: Opaque with a fading tan creamy head and left spotty lace in its wake. The aroma has notes of charred and chocolate malt, plum and star fruit, molasses and liquorice, coffee and herbal hops, REALLY NICE !!<P> The taste starts with ultra rich malting over a fruity twang supported by some hop and coffee bitterness. Some smoke and earthy qualities on the finish. The mouth feel is lush and oily  with just enough carbonation to keep ya very interested, dry and ashy finish.  WOW, What a powerhouse and very well attenuated, a beautiful sipping beer and a must try for any stoutie.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1789,"2008-02-11",3.6,"On tap @ Coles Buffalo NY. Pours a deep black. Medium body with ligfht to medium oily mouthfeel. Coffee, anise flavors. Leaves a strange bitterness on tip of your tongue. pretty good but prefer thre Robust porter","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
1789,"2008-02-11",3.2,"Deep pitch black coloured body, 100% opaque with a thick tan head. Aroma of deep roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate and strong pit fruits...but of course some roasted malt is tucked in there too. Full-bodied; Super chewy mouthful that doesnt start pleasant - very meaty and mushroomy flavours start out the taste, coupled with roasted malt, nuts and some sweetness of deep pit fruits. Aftertaste shows some cherries, chocolate and even more meaty and savoury tastes. Overall, a decent - but too strong and too meaty flavour. Still worth trying, but Ive had many other baltic porters that were better than this one. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in Arlington (Clarendon), Virginia on 9-February-2008.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
1789,"2008-02-04",4.1,"22 oz bomber.  Pours a thick oily black with a thick creamy light brown head.  Aroma of roasted coffee beans and malt, black licorice and chocolate.

1789,"2008-01-31",3.6,"Bomber.  Pours a nice deep dark almsot black with a nice thin lasting tan head.  Aroma is green, earthy and herbal hops- typical smutty- similar to the impy stout aroma- but with nice chocolate malts  but also some greet acetaldehyde- too new?  Chocolate and nuts in the flavor, a bit of tar, licorice, and anise- bitter hoppy and dark chocolate finish- phenolic and a touch of yeast.  Relatively smooth overall- although I get a bit of alcohol as it warms.  Pretty good overall- but a bit young and very green (hoopy, new and acetaldehyde).","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1789,"2008-01-30",4.2,"Pours viscous black with less than a finger of tan head.  Aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, raisin, and dark fruit.  Flavor contains largely coffee notes up front, complemented by dark chocolate in the middle, and raisin, fig, licorice, and slight hop bitterness  at the end.  Fairly thick and creamy body finishes slightly dry.  One of the better Baltics Ive had the pleasure of consuming.","Quincy, Massachusetts, USA","lordeche"
1789,"2008-01-29",4.0,"Shared by Dickinsonbeer. Just about opaque black in color with a creamy brown head.  Aroma: Chocolate, and heavily roasted malt, light hints of ash.  Taste is alot of chocolate, and roasted malt with a big moderately sweet creamy body.  Very smooth- finishes with some lightly acrid, bitter roasted grain.  Thought this was great.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
1789,"2008-01-28",4.1,"Malty sweet with a lot of chocolate and roast in the flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and velvety. Much more body than I anticipated. No trace of alcohol. A pleasure to drink. One of their best.","Nashua, New Hampshire, USA","JugOPunch"
1789,"2008-01-27",4.0,"Pours thick black like motor oil into the English pint glass with a fluffy two inch tan head.  Heavy espresso-like aromas with some notes of malt and chocolate.  A very robust flavor with a heavy rush of chocolate chips, malt and coffee.  A very thick, coating mouthfeel with a bitter, dry finish.  Very enjoyable.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"
1789,"2008-01-26",4.0,"Pours opaque black, with a tan head of a half-inch. The tightly packed foam settled quickly and dissapated to a partial skim-coat, and eventually to several errant whisps.
Aromatics are laced with acrid malt, bitter chocolate, spent coffee grounds, and powdered nougat. Quite dry and roasty in the nose.
The mouthfeel is full, chewy, and very creamy.
The pallet is filled with heavily roasted malt, singed chocolate bits, and burnt bread ends.
Warming alcohol follows through along with hints of black licorice and lingering dark caramel.
Bitterness is smooth and balancing, and other hopping is subdued. Fruity esters are no-where to be found.
Finishes very dry, somewhat acrid, and a bit grainy.

I can see this becoming a crushed velvet tongue tickler after a couple of years in the cellar.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"
