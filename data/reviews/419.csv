419,"2017-05-23",3.6,"Appearance: clear medium amber with one fat finger of fluffy ivory head, good retention and moderate lacing. (4/5) Aroma: floral, caramel, resin. (7/10) Taste: moderate sweet, moderate bitter. (7/10) Palate: medium body, moderate carbonation, off-dry medium bitter finish. (4/5)

Definitely one of the best Cream Ales Ive ever had. Scratch, that, I checked: its the best example of the style Ive ever had. Mostly because of the larger-than-normal hop presence, of course. Unlike most Cream Ales, this one has a significant hop presence, pretty evenly balanced against the sweet malt in intensity. Not a whole lot happening, but very easy drinking. Definitely would not say no to another. (14/20)

Slick, sweet, a touch hot, wooden bitterness, nail polish. The flavor is burly and disoriented, with bitter orange peel and pine clumsily suffocating whatever stylistic integrity might be present. It is medicinal and cloyingly sweet, with a vanilla hard candy flavor that can fall in the diacetyl spectrum.

419,"2015-07-26",3.2,"The pour is a medium amber, with an insignificant, off-white head. The soft, porous cap diminishes within minutes to a thin ring at the glass with only a wisp of the foam remaining across the surface. Muted caramel and mandarin oranges is my take, citrus-y hops biting the air as I breathe deeply, inhaling the aroma.
The temperature is 45 degrees, perfect for my appreciation of most light-medium bodied ales, and so I tip the glass and pull a mouthful, flooding my taste buds with the brew. The flavor is a mirror image of the aroma, I find their ""Sweet Action""; for me, its clover honey in light malts, a slight pine resin across my tongue, very dry after the swallow. The finish is dry, in that limbo-land between tasty and tasteless and on the gauge just where it makes me want to have another pull to freshen my mouth and re-engage my taste buds.
Its a drinkable brew, and a bit undefined; but apparently thats what they were looking for when they created this cream ale. A little bit of this and a little bit of that seems to be fairly accurate and I cant say Im enjoying this in any particular style, but it certainly isnt bad as a weekend drinker.

The outstanding flavor profile is slightly intense, a bit complex and perfectly balanced. A blend of hop flavor resides over a mild bitterness and covers the aromas of the nose.

 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  Served a hazy orange colored brew with only a tiny head. The head fades very fast to leave almost no lacing.

 Smell  The smell is rather light. There are hints of a bready aroma as well as a very light citrus and pine smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with some bread flavors and a lighter citrus hop flavor. The citrus is largely orange peel in nature, but some light flavors of grapefruit. In the middle of the taste some lemon comes to the tongue and mixes with the rest. The taste ends with a pine and earthy bite, which leave a lightly bittered flavor on the tongue

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thinner side with a carbonation level that is just above average. Not bad for the style of the beer and gives it a crisper feel. 

 Overall  A decent beer, but nothing too exceptional. Nothing really stands out in this one, but nothing really takes away either.","","Darkmagus82"

419,"2014-07-07",3.4,"One of the selling points of Sixpoint beers is they come in little skinny cans which just look like energy drinks or something to a casual observer and thus you can drink them w/o being rudely interrupted by Chicago Transit Authority staff--not that I would ever do such a thing, mind you. In any case, the description on this stealthy CTA-ready can makes the beer sound like its going to be some heavily malt centric Amber or something but its actually more along the lines of an American Pale Ale. It is orange in color with a small white head that leaves behind little patches of lacing. The nose is very much focused on American hops, smells like pine w/ a slight savory character. Flavor is a touch sweet and the main thing I am noticing is a flavorful tea leaf astringent note and a touch lemon and mandarin orange from the hops. It is medium bodied but still feels pretty light on the palate thanks to moderate carbonation. It finishes w/ a resinous bitterness and some lingering sugary malt character.

T: Nice sweet beer with hints of coriander and cake flour. There a bavarian yeast character here as well. A bit of a sour pinch on the finish as well.

Nose is fruity and juicy with peach and orange citrus. Theres a playful bite on the nose from the simcoe hops and a little pepper. Underneath is good bready malt thats honey sweet. Taste is light and fruity with floral hops, peach, apricot and orange peel. The cracker and bread are sturdy but light as a feather and carry all that fruit over the palate with ease. Finishes with another bite from the simcoe on the back palate and leaves dry with a sticky, sweet aftertaste and a touch of bitter. Body is creamy and although well carbonated, it was downright silky. 

This beer wasnt short on hops at all and the hop character was intense but without oil or too much bitter. The simcoe never got catty and the bread, while sweet, never outclassed the fruit. Easy to see why Sixpoint was #1 at the NYS TAP festival. So far each offering is unique and expertly done. This was a graceful interpretation of a cream ale that drank easily and with a little panache.","New York, USA","pinkie"

The beer appears transparent and orange colored, with a good sized head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. The aroma is rather weak, with a light dose of malt. The flavor is really tasty, with a very subtle fruitiness and enjoyable malt flavors. This is by far the best cream ale I have ever had. The beer finishes with a healthy amount of bitterness, more so than expected. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I can definitely see why this is the top rated cream ale.

More like a Pale Ale then a Cream Ale, which is a good thing. Medium bodied. Nothing great but its pretty good, I liked it.

Super orange hazy with a medium sized white sudsy head.  Nose is sweet, but not overly sugary, some light citrus and resinous hops,  a little bit vegetal,  dust and dirt lingering.

Really big fluffy carbonation thats extremely smooth in the mouth. Grainy taste as well, with a bit sharper hop profile, a bit of toffee, and a drying mineral finish. The hops just have a bit of boozy sharpness to them that are a bit off-putting. Id like to see them a bit smoother. Still, its easy-to-drink and flavorful, without being too heavy.

419,"2012-04-13",3.0,"Actually somewhat dark for a cream ale. Looks like a dark IPA, almost an amber. Thin head. Aroma is sweet and yeasty. A hint of orange. Flavor is much the same. That pervasive doughy, yeasty flavor that I dont care for in NA beers. Defined spike of orangey hops in the back. Low on the bitterness, letting the sweetness show through. A little hint of woody resin in the middle. Pretty full of flavor for the style. Carbonation is a little heavy. Full bodied and slick on the tongue. Just a weird beer. Blindly, Id have to guess this was an APA, but with something off about it. It doesnt fit the typical Cream Ale mold, but then again Ive never really figured out the point of a Cream Ale anyway. Not bad, but Id rather see something else as a regular offering from Sixpoint.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
419,"2012-04-12",3.6,"Can. Lager Glass. Pours a murky caramel brown color. Fluffy off-white head. Hops are dominant in the aroma, and there is grass, a touch or orange peel/lemon, with some pine. Palate is bitter with hop up front, then mellows into malts and finishes sweet. Flavor varies from corn/grain, then piny hops, then caramel malts. At times, it wants to be watery, then pilsner-like, but then it finishes more like a malty lager, and texture like a hefe would. But its neither in the end. But, I put it above other beers as it looks good and the taste is interesting enough.","New Windsor, New York, USA","beerscout"
419,"2012-04-09",2.8,"A: Pours a light golden color with a two-finger soapy white head with good retention and lacing. The body itself looks a bit yeasty.

S: The smell features some almost weizen-esque esters (banana, cloves, allspice), along side a noble aspect.

T/M: Honestly, the flavor is a bit lacking. Whats there isnt bad...there just isnt much there in the first place. Theres a very subtle sweetness on the open, while the finish is purely bready, with the murky, earthy notes hindering its refreshment. Apparently, I know next to jack shit about cream ales, other than the fact that theyre basically pale lagers with more ester-y goodness (whatever the blue hell that means), and that this doesnt seem to be a traditional cream ale. Still, Id gladly trade some of the fruity notes on the open for a crisper finish. Its a little too rough and chalky on the tongue, but its well carbonated.

O: This is a beer that doesnt know what it wants to be. Is it a weak pale ale or a muddy pilsener? Maybe I should chalk it up to me not getting this style of beer. Probably wont revisit this in the future.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

This beer pours a light to medium bodied orangish dull copper in color with a creamy white, one finger head. Its much darker than I anticipated. The aromas are different than I expected. I get some slightly sweet amber malts, light citrus, light happiness, and it has a certain creaminess to it, indicative of a can.The flavors are light and smooth. I get a lot of smooth malts with citrus accents and a ever so slight hop bitterness. It is incredibly smooth and creamy, obviously made for a can. Its solid, and much different than other cream ales Ive had. It has more body and isnt as session able yet has more flavor and more to offer.","Fishers, Indiana, USA","aasher"
419,"2012-03-23",3.6,"Sure doesnt smell like a cream ale, like sticking my nose in a hop bin,defintely more American Pale Aleish,,a successful dry hopping procedure, that pretty much dominates the nose. Taste is however totaly unlike the aroma,here you get a straight balance of grain malt and grain hop,then hop bitterness in finish, That balanced blend is then washed from the palate almost immediately after the swallow,very mysterious how that happens. I take it this is supposed to be a surprising mix of malt sweetness(hence that Cream ale designation) and hop bitterness, but that quick ghostly appearance and disappearance of the malt ,makes a style assignment impossible. Very drinkable,session type,would go great with a spicey sweet salsa","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"

I like how all this melds together to make a nicely done, sessionable beer. Taste is mildly flavorful, while remaining quaffable. A big drink is not out of the question. Creamy mouthfeel and somewhere between light and medium bodied. Finish is abrupt, but thats what it ought to be.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
419,"2012-03-10",3.7,"I poured a 16oz can into a lager glass.

Appearance: Dark orange color with a hazy body, although carbonation bubbles of different sizes and speeds are easily visible. Forms a good sized eggshell colored, frothy head which retains and laces very well.

Smell: Light confectionary notes of toffee and caramel, plus some more rustic aroma of black tea, honey roasted peanuts and floral hops.

Taste: The palate to Sixpoint Sweet Action is something of a contradiction. Its quite complex (surprisingly so, in fact), but its not all that robust or delectably delicious. It begins quite mild with a light nutty sweetness plus some candy flavor. It seems to turn on a dime into something quite stronger, though. Toffee, caramel, honey, and the faintest hint of citrusy hop bitterness all come through in the second half. It finishes much like it begins on a mild, subtle note with hint of herbal tea. 

Whats interesting is that throughout the entire palate theres a barely detectable lager-like component at the core. Its reminiscent of a Vienna or Munich-style lager or even an Oktoberfest. Slightly grassy, slightly lemony, a tad astringent, but aside from using the term ""grainy"" (which I hate), its best described as an all-malt lager character. The aftertaste is a mild chalky bitterness and texture, but the beer itself is quite refreshing while its in the mouth. Plenty of flavor to enjoy, but kept at a ""lower volume"" so as not to overwhelm.

Drinkability: While Sweet Action may have some lager character to the palate, its delivery is all ale for sure. The mouthfeel is a soft, medium-to-light body with an almost creamy texture. Despite all the carbonation you can see in the glass, it doesnt interfere with the drinking process as it goes down very smoothly. At only 5.2% ABV, Sixpoint definitely deserves kudos for being able to get so much flavor out of the brew. Technically too big to be a ""session beer,"" but I could see most drinkers having no trouble with a 4-pack box of this over the course of a day or a weekend and still being able to function.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

419,"2012-03-02",3.1,"The final surviving can from a nice haul courtesy of AndrewNations in the SS BIF. 16 oz. aluminum cylinder, I salute you ere I consume you.

Poured into a glass that came in the same box, this is big, fluffy, yellow leaning towards orange. Runaway carbonation is readily apparent. Smell is brimstone hops mixed with grain husks & several pinches of allspice. Hop presence is startling for the claimed 34 IBUs. Hmmm.

Sweet Action is only the third cream ale Ive ever had, & doesnt win me over to the style. Yawning disconnect between nose & taste, this is crawling with heavy, bready malts. Very grainy, soft herbal hops, tangerine. Theres an oddness lurking in the aftertaste that isnt welcome, & I cant quite pinpoint it. Musty, with a side of margarine. Not terrible, but certainly knocks the taste a bit & ruins the cleanliness of the initial flavors. I love big cans, but 12 oz. of this would have been plenty.

The slight off-taste really brings this one down. I love a good session ale (whatever the ABV), but if theyre not perfect, they can rapidly become suspect. This one is close, but the aftertaste really corrupts a good experience. Not bad, not good, decent enough.","Minnesota, USA","maximum12"

I had the opportunity to try this beer again, Im told the recipe has been reworked a bit. Resinous, earthy, light oniony hop nose with plenty of toasted bready maltiness to back it up. Firm earthy resinous spicy hop flavor with the same maltiness to back it up nicely. Im not sure why both sites have this listed as a Cream ale, its more of a APA than anything, and its a damn fine beer if you get into the right frame of mind for it . Im glad I revisited this! My rating reflects this session. 
9/17/2011 Pours a slightly cloudy deep reddish amber color with a smallish fluffy white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Smells of earthy herbal hops and biscuit bready malt. Hints of lemony dish soap turned me off a bit. Taste is malty but not a sweet as I had expected from a cream ale. Lots of bitter earthy hops keep this less balanced than the side of the can would lead you to believe. Medium body and carbonation level, slick almost sticky mouthfeel. This one grew on me as I drank it and as it warmed, but I really dont see the attraction here. Its not really a cream ale, but its a pretty good drinker.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

At any rate, Im sure Ive had it before, maybe at TAP or something.... and that is what I was starting to write when I was accidentally on the page for Double Sweet Action.  This is a pretty cool diversion of a beer in nifty packaging.  Spicy character pervades in a way that seems almost to be Belgian yeastyish.  Refreshing despite mild sweetness and soft body.  Bitter though not dry.  Sweet/spice/citrus on seedy toasty bread, its really not an APA or hoppy amber, and I am quite enjoying this nearly on a revelatory level.  It doesnt hurt one bit that this and the Bengali Tiger cans I picked up are adorned with bits of amazing poetic verse.

Strong olfactory presence; sweet and rotten at the same time, weird candy like as well.  Big strong hop presence, wants to be an IPA but the maltiness is there and forces it to back off in a cloyingly sweet way.  Large and in charge this sweet brew is.  Seems like much more than 5% fer sure.  Its almost like it wasnt fermented enough to get the sugars out er somethin. Yucky kucky mucky.  Reminds me of many amber ales that are overdone and experimented with.  Cloying sweetness overcomes the palate at time.  Finish is unique hard old style candy laced with alky. Long bitter finish of an amber that wants to be an IPA, wew.  Quite dissapointing to the pale lager lover.

Right off the bat, Ill say that I was quite excited to try this one, as its been the number one Cream Ale for quite some time nice. Since most beers in this style are pretty awful, I was anxiously anticipating trying a good one. This delivered. Bigtime.

Pours a clear golden color with a really nice white head. Good retention and some swell lacing. Good so far. The nose was really quite faint. There was a touch of floral hops with a bit of breadiness. Pretty tame. Really tame, in fact. The taste countered with an explosion of flavor. Perfect balance between light bready/grainy sweetness and floral and herbal hops. Nice and delicate. Very refreshing. Best cream ale, by far. The feel backed that up. It was nice and crisp with a solidly bitter finish. Really well done. Enthusiastic thumbs up, Sixpoint.

Semi-dry finish with bitterness peaking at a 3.  Body is a little watery, light smooth carbonation.  Not too bad at this price point, definitely drinkable.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

English malt characters abound but American, fresh, oily hops dominate. The body has faint grapefruit tartness that balances sweet English toffee and sweet peach.

Aroma: The nose on this one is has some spice/caramel malts and resiny hop notes.

Hey, look at that, rater #100!  Its always randomly cool when stuff like that happens.  Im a little surprised Ive never rated this one, but Im almost positive that I have had it a few times before.

Sweet biscuity/bready malt and light yeastiness. Followed up by a bit of hop bitterness.

419,"2006-07-21",3.7,"Cream ale... interesting. I didnt know what I was getting myself into when ordering this beer -- no one seemed to have any idea what style it was -- and when drinking it I was having a lot of trouble pinning down the style. I noticed some lager characteristics but noticed it was still very fruity and pretty rich, and certainly couldnt come up with a lager style to match, so I ended up hesitantly labelling it an EPA, even though I did notice a slight amount of grapefruit (American) hop aroma. The aroma was very perfumy with carribean fruit punch. Pretty rich malts in the taste, some munich style vegetably flavor, and earth finishing hops. Now that I think about it, Cream Ale is the perfect designation for a beer like this. I just wish I couldve identified it.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Head is small, but well retained and wispy, providing great lacing down the sides of the glass.  Aroma of clean, honeyish pils malt, soft sweet white dough, bits of lemons, tangerines, peaches and angel-food cake with a clean and light Belgian yeast presence.  Maybe a passing floral note of hops in the nose, but otherwise pretty light on those.  Flavor is pretty straightforward, very clean honey, light grainy pale malt, a bit more light peaches and a touch of sweet tangerines.  A bit of creaminess through the middle with a light Belgian yeastiness to follow, with light dough/malt sugars lingering on.  Very clean and wonderfully drinkable, with a low to moderate carbonation.  Hops keep the beer dry, without being terribly flavorful or noticeable, but thats fine with me.  A well-done piece of brewing, as seen by the clean nature, great balance and easy mouthfeel.  Surprised to see its 6.9abv.  Gets a little watery and loose in texture as it warms, with, perhaps, the malt getting a little boring at the end of the glass and some definite breadiness growing on the palate.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours very light color- with slight haze- to almost clear, and a nice pure white fluffy head.  Aroma is bready and malty with a good amount of herbal and spicy hops.  Flavor is also pretty malty with a good amount of that traditional belgian spicy and fruity yeast with a nice hoppy backbone for bittering.
