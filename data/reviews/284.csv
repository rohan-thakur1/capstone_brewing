Alcoholic too, and that goes for the flavor as well. And the aftertaste. Oily, warming mouthfeel with rice, fruityness and something sugary.

284,"2008-06-10",2.6,"07/06 Had several shots from 0.75 l bottle courtesy of ogivlado, thanks a lot! This sake had just slightly yellow color body with good oily legs. Quite skunky aroma, bad rice, some wood with industrial notes and alcohol for sure. Flavor was pretty oily and full, but as its sake leaves watery impression. Notes of wood here beats medicinal notes. Short but fine aftertaste. Very easy for drinking, although its clearly seen its of much lower quality than the other sake Ive tried few months ago.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

284,"2007-01-23",2.6,"0.75l bottle. Produced by Choya Umeshu Deutschland in Willich. I spotted this almost by accident in the big Merkur store near the Graz bus station, and ozujsko got it (thanks!). My second sake, and Im not completely sure I still fully understand the subleties of this type of beverage. Completely clear and still, like water. Nose... interesting. Medicinal, a bit overly so, nice notes of rice crackers and some nougat. The taste is sweeter than the last I had. Watery of course, some weak lemon and some medicine. Not bad, but didnt impress me. Wish I couldve done a side by side comparison with Mitoku. The medicinal ""quality"" apparently gets a lot more pronounced when warm, but I didnt try it that way, and it wasnt as bad as I expected it to be. I might be underrating it too.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
