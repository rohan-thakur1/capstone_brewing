3831,"2017-05-09",3.9,"On tap @ Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2016. This is a mild blurry looking one, golden in color and on the top a medium sized light bubbly white head. It has a really nice aroma, made up from eastery yeast, fruity pear, some sweet apple. Its also a little lemonic without any clear or sharp sourness. The sourness comes in the taste though. It has a mild oily texture and a average carbonation level. Mild lemon juices with more pear. Super lightdrinkable, lots of flavor and quite moreish. 13.05.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

3831,"2016-10-20",4.0,"From notes. This was enjoyed at Jolly Pumpkin on October 1 for Zwanze Day 2016! The pour is a nice lightly hazy golden orange with a thin white head and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is full of tropical fruits and a light apple skin before the funk sets in. There is a dusty barnyard and a bit of mineral on the back end. I like it. The flavor is tart fruits right up front. There is a light citrus and a dry barnyard funkiness to it. Its not overly done in any facet, I like it. The mouth feel is a little thicker bodied than I was expecting with a crisp light carbonation and a lingeringly tart and dry citrus finish. This is a good beer.

[ Bottle ][ bytemesis ][ 750ml ][ Trade ][ Reidel XL Pinot Noir ][ 4/20/14 ]
>> Rating #7900! Pours glowing straw golden with lower foam, wispy lacing. Hill Farmstead type of aroma with more zesty clementine, mild rice vinegar, tangelo, fresh real grapefruit. Taste is bubbly up front, mild acetic bite, finishing clean and spicy with refreshing grapefruit juice, tangerine, sweet honey roll. As it warms it sort of drops from light acetic white peach to something lightly sticky like Valencia orange sections. Very Hill Farmstead through and through. Rather than HFs house sweet cream butter and all lacto, this has a mild acetic bite that blends well with the citrus and doesnt distract.

With more savory, yeasty, saline nuances expressed as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is fuller, yet refreshing, with fine carbonation and prickly, mouthwatering acidity. Dry and crisp. Flavors are reminiscent of cider, with yellow apples, tart crab apples, and oak spice, intermingled with a unique savory, saline, Unami flavor and metallic note as the beer warms. Simple, yet impressive. I imagine this will continue to age just fine. Not to many beers out there on this level.. One to follow.

Aroma is fairly fruity along with quite a bit of fruity Brett character. Medium light oak character. Moderate citrus, light pear and red apple with moderate tropical fruit including pineapple. Light malt character and light acidity.

Flavor starts with a medium light acidity and quite a bit of citrus and tropical fruit. Medium light bitterness and medium light oak character. Light malt notes. Medium light barnyard funk, most of the Brett character is expressed as fruit notes. 
Medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low acidic based astringency and low alcohol warmth.

3831,"2013-12-30",4.1,"In short: A tart fruity blonde ale with a strong dirty farmhouse funk character. Lovely. 
How: From a bottle at Hill Farmstead FoFA 2013.
The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a small white head.
In long: A fun original aroma blending a strong musky/animal wild character with plenty of fresh light color fruits. In mouth the beer has a full body and a lively carbonation, a pleasant mouthfeel. Taste follows through. A lot of fruits (peaches, apricots, others) well integrated in the farmhouse animal funk. Some oak, some honey. Assertive and refreshing tartness without being very sour per say. I am really digging this new brewery.
