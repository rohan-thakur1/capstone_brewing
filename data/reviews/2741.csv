2741,"2013-07-08",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2013 Ive been drinking this regularly for about a week now.  I called it for German hops in the nose with their bright lemon oil character, very much like Spalt and Hallertauer in their pithiness only more green and pungent and raw-smelling. The bitterness gives it away as American hops where theres an intense lemon rind astringency on a very soft body leaving the mouth parched and puckering. They canned it with yeast, Im so glad to see that.  But it is risky to shake around in a backpack or pocket.  It mixes in and you have a hefeweizen-looking bitter paint-flavored beer. With a day unmoved to settle and a careful pour the yeast will sit at the bottom of the can. After that you have a golden glass of Oregon lager with a glowing haze and a fine white head and it looks like a zwickelpils right out of Franconia. Yeast creaminess softens the already pillowy malt texture.  just above 5%, and it appears  off-dry with the bitterness overwhelming the mouth with a lasting cotton-mouth finish but really its very sweet, and with Spalt hops and harder water I could see this coming out of Germany instead of Oregon.  Funny enough its the coastal Oregon soft water that gives it a very Czech-like full, savory texture softened even further by the yeast. Not even a touch of what I consider corn.  Zero corn flavor, zero corn smell, only a fuller body with less sweetness, working in perfect harmony with strong bitterness in the same way as an assertively-hopped English bitter.   No garlic, no pineapple gum, no pine resin, no Christmas tree or pet pee. Its Rossdorfer Urbräu with Americanized strains of high AA Saaz and its lovely in every way.  Ive put down 15 cans so far.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

THe pour brings forward a sparkling yellow brew with an average fizzy white head. Fair retention and an average amount of lacing. The nose brings some light grainy malt. The malt is accompanied by a light floral-hop character. The flavor balances between the two. Theres a light grainy taste at the beginning followed by a slight amount of chewy bread. The floral hops finish things off and lead to a bitter and dry finish, thats unfortunately also a bit astringent. Light body with fizzy carbonation.
