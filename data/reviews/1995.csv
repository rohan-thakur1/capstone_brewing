Strong and unpleasant aroma of urine, ammonia, solvent, citric acid, vegetables and roasted malts. Flavor is sour, smoked, some roasted malts, a little bit like green vegetables. Unfortunately the beer was been spoiled, by the infection probably, very stinky aroma of urine caused that it was been hard to finish whole bottle. Ive had soar throat after drinking this beer, but Im not sure if this is caused by the beer infection. Too bad, because I really like most of the Siren beers.","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","Navers"
