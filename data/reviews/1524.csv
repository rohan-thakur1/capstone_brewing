1524,"2017-04-24",4.3,"Dégustée en fût lors dune visite très plaisante des installations de cette jeune brasserie. Comme toutes les bières dégustes sur place, celle-ci présente une mousse formidable, serrée, crémeuse et persistante. Bien voilée, robe claire et rayonnante. Une quantité phénoménale de fruits tropicaux au nez. Un remarquable dry-hop de Pale Ale de la côte Est. Du houblon à la mangue. De la mangue au houblon? De lananas. Une base granuleuse à la fois légère et affirmée que je note également dans toutes les bières de cette brasserie. Aucune amertume ne bouche. Les gorgées senchaînent à un rythme fou qui minquiète lorsque je pense à cette tournée des brasseries que nous débutons aujourdhui et qui commence par une si grande soif de cette première bière! Des saveurs de forêts parfaitement tissées aux fruits tropicaux. Une merveilleuse balance entre le chaud et le froid. À boire goulûment au pichet.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
