3161,"2015-03-05",4.1,"Tap. Deep purple, mahogany edges. Thin layer of sand-colored foam. The nose: vanilla, toffee, cherry, sweet blackberry syrup, balsamic vinegar, oak, bourbon, butter. Sweet, smooth, complex. Flavor is balsamic vinegar-forward, with additional butterscotch, toffee, maple and blackberry. Fairly acidic but also complex, as new flavors emerge with each sip. Green apple and lemon peel pop up eventually. Sweet in the front, sour in the back. Alternates between sweet and sour. Fairly light body, wispy and whipped on the tongue. Mild carbonation but big acidity. A very complex, but very drinkable sour. I enjoy the back and forth between sweet and sour, cherry and blackberry, oak and butter.","","PartyFowle"
3161,"2015-02-18",3.6,"Aroma is interestingly complex - blackberry, maple, malt and whiskey aromas.

Color is a dark reddish brown, fairly clear, with a slight light brown head. 

Taste is dominated by a pretty pronounced sourness. Moderately sweet and bitter with fairly heavy acidity.

Palate - comes across as surprisingly light body; carbonation is fairly lively. Finish is long.

Overall this beer leaves with the impression that the barrels were higher quality than the beer. Its a fairly good beer, but not great. The beer per se comes across as a bit light weight.","Michigan, USA","smroush"

Growler held up well it seems! Taste follows aroma with blackberry syrup, lemon, faint sourness. Body is light, with soft carbonation and fruity tart finish. Overall, this variant of Love is deliciously fruity and juicy that edges Dark Blackberry Origins in terms of crushability.

3161,"2014-08-18",4.5,"Brilliant oaky vinous sour aroma with some slight fruit and slight bourbon. Taste is vinous sour. Maybe 6 of 10 with plenty of dark fruit and some vanilla from the bourbon in the finish. Really great flavors. Ton of flavor and very complex. Carbonation dies fast and that detracts from this one a bit, but a great sour overall.

3161,"2010-12-06",4.3,"On tap at Brouwers Big Wood 2010. This one stole the show for me - I really wished Id ordered another before the keg blew. Pours a murky brown - *almost* a faint purple tinge to it, but mostly murky, muddy brown. Smells like a dream. Blackberry, sure - also cherry, cider, and a wonderfully musty oak that perfectly offsets the brightness of the fruit. These notes, for the most part, come through in the flavor, although the taste isnt quite as pungent as the aroma. It has that velvety smoothness that I love about New Belgium sours. This is simply delicious. I loved it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
3161,"2010-12-05",4.4,"Tasted at FoBAB 2010 and Fountainhead a couple weeks later.  Pours an almost black purple color with a thick purple tinted head that lasts for a while before leaving a thick lace head.  The nose is sour and funky with bourbon and vanilla oak, and tart blackberry.  THe flavor is sweet and tart up front with the blackberry seemingly providing both flavors.  The bourbon and vanilla both peak through, in addition to some citrus sour notes and brown sugar.  The body is pretty full with a syrupy texture, average carbonation, and a long sour finish that is dominated by citrus and blackberry and a hint of malt finally coming through.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

Light sweetness from the bourbon settles into the flavor, with notes of oak, vanilla.  Almost shocking, the balance between the sweetness of the bourbon and fruit and sourness.  The earthiness seems to be add a bit of gloss and polish.  Really well made.  A standout of the festival.  I hope to be lucky enough to have this again.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
3161,"2010-11-17",4.2,"Many many samples at FOBAB 2010.  the standout of the festival for me by quite a margin although my score may totally depict that...Pours a non-transparent murky reddish brown tinted hue with some lighter edges as you move towards the sides of the sampling glass. Topped off with a thin to medium light beige head...Aromas are blackberry upfront immediately followed up by vanilla and bourbon undertones while still showing some acidity and sourness.  reall nice combination... Flavors follow suit nicely with a well meshed platter of blackberries, a fairly decent dose of vanilla bourbon, and wood.  the whiskey was pretty assertive actually but the fruit and acidic nature of the brew kept it at bay.  much of the flavor teeters from sweet and then sour, somewhat acidic but never swaying too far in either direction.  extremely balanced between the two actually.  Finish is somewhat intense from an acidic and vinegar perspective but it holds it all together without too much disturbance. Body and carbonation were just right for the style, neither too light or heavy...Cant wait to try this again somewhere down the road.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3161,"2010-11-16",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2011 Draft sample at FOBAB 2010.  Pours a hazy brown color with a small frothy head.  Aroma leans more heavily toward the blackberries, brett, funk, and acidic notes than toward the barrel notes, though they are present with some good oak character.  The flavor, however, takes it to another level with the perfect merger of barrel and funky blackberry flavors.  Fresh blackberries, oak, vanilla, whiskey, sour funk, balsamic, and lactic acid.  Light-medium bodied, with a hard-to-describe mouthfeel other than sour-fruity-barrel and moderate carbonation.  Awesome beer, easily one of my favorites of the festival. Re-Rate, 5/6/11: Im bumping this down a slight notch, just because the sourness wasnt quite where the Apple Whiskey Barrel version was. This was vinious, smooth, and rich, and I got great blackberry character. Still awesome.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3161,"2010-11-11",4.0,"Draft at FoBAB 8. This was a consensus winner among RBers at our floating table(s). Pours a murky purpley brown with white head. Nose is fresh fruit, raspberry syrup, cherries and acid. Lacto is very present, as is some vanilla. On taste, nice level of acidity that is likely a lot higher than registers with the sweetness from the blackberry and the barrel. We were guessing there may be some of the kriek blended in as well because of the level of fruitiness. Still, kept going back to this one. Fantastic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3161,"2010-11-10",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2010 Sampled at FoBAB 2010 (Chicago, IL). Pours a murky brownish hue, near opaque, some lighter edges. Frothy tannish heaad laces a bit. Aromas are sour vinegar, some blackberry fruit, light bretty funk, some wet oak and bourbon with some decent bretty funk, fruity liveliness. Vanilla, toffee, some pit fruit. Initial is a dose of prickly sweet and tart blackberry, touches of wet oak, vanilla, toffee, brett, vinegar and balsamic, touches of bourbon. Finish is fruity blackberry tannins, oak, and vinegar. Very nice, prickly, sour, yet not overdone. A lot of balsamic, with great blackberry tannins, touches of funk and leather, lactic acid, oaky vanilla and punches of bourbon spirit poking in and out.

The bourbon flavor is overwhelming and dominates every aspect of this beer. Slight fruit taste but again bourbon comes through. Somewhat harsh on the palate, very ""hot"" boozy flavor. The sourness leaves your mouth dry. Overall, I would say it is a good experiment and I was glad to try it but it is not very drinkable.
