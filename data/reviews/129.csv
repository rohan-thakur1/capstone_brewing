129,"2016-08-14",4.1,"375ml bottle via trade with Asheft, thanks Alex, split in two with my uncle.
2008 Harvest.
Couleur amber, caramel, le tout offrant un léger filament huileux sur les rebords du verre.
Arôme est assez classique dans la lignée cidre de glace avec pas mal de belles effluves de pommes et un généreux bouquet caramélisé de pommes pressées.
Palais met en valeur le profil des pommes alernant sur un léger résineux et une douceur de sucre résiduel caramel. Le tout est très frais, parfait en dessert avec un quasi 11% de volume passant sans problème. Petite pointe acerbe parvient tout de meme à percer en fin de bouche offrant ce cacractère de pomme grinçant un peu aux dents. Cidre parfait mettant bien en valeur des variétés canadiennes.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

The apples come out fresh and tangy in the nose, but with an interesting herbal, grassy middle with a bit of hay as well.  The finish is a mix of brown sugar sweet and woody, solvent-like higher fusels that Ive seldom detected in an ice cider.
In the lower spectrum in terms of acidity, which is a bit of a shame because it tends to smooth out the booze and cloyness.  Taste was entrancing through, with touches of cinnamon, banana, mangoes and pineapple.  Body was a bit light, and alcohol was apparent in the finish as it heated up my tongue.
