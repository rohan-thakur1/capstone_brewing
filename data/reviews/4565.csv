It is refreshing and softly carbonated but creamy and mild at the same time. The taste starts sweet with orange, coriander and the wheat flavor typical for Belgian wit beers. Then comes the surprise, floral, herbal and hoppy at the back of the tongue just like an american style IPA. All these flavours are balanced perfectly.

Kolor: Słomkowy, odrobinę zmętniony.
Piana: Dosyć obfita, ale raczej średniopęcherzykowa, mydlana, szybko opada prawie do zera i pozostawia śladowy lacing.
Aromat: piękny aromat, głównie cytrusowy, pomarańczowy (trochę jak pomarańczowy aromat do ciasta) pomieszany z dużą dawką kolendry. Mówiąc szczerze jest to dla mnie taki podkręcony witbier - chmielowych aromatów za bardzo nie czuje, choć być może część tych cytrusów pochodzi od chmielu.
Smak: Powtórka z rozrywki, leciutka śladowa goryczka. Piwo jest kwaskowate co świetnie współgra z aromatami cytrusowymi. Pomimo 7,6 % alkoholu, nie czuć go w ogóle. Piwo jest średnio pełne.
Wysycenie: średnie - jak na wita mogłoby być trochę wyższe, ale sprawia, że piwo świetnie wchodzi.
Opakowanie: Jedna z ładniejszych etykiet Mikkellera. Podane chmiele i słód.

Aroma combines tropical fruity notes with Belgian style yeasty spiciness and floral hoppiness. Quite rich aroma with maybe hoppiness the strongest element, surprisingly. Taste is very hoppy for a wit with also some spicy notes around. Initial fresh fruitiness bends towards a long, dry and bitter finish. The palate is medium to full bodied with a smooth texture. Enjoyable, rich taste: hoppiness is fairly owerpowering but there are just about enough Belgian features to be noticeable too. Update: this time seems more like a witbier, or its 2.0 -version.

4565,"2012-10-16",3.8,"July 17th, 2010 - The name is very appropos. This is NOT just another wit, but Just Another Wit. Hints that this is an atypical brew begin with just a glance at the glass - a puffy, off-white head, but the color of the body is darker than is usual for the style, though attended by the characteristic cloudiness. The smell is pungent, not with the more common aromas of cracked wheat, but dry orange preserves, white wine and white grape juice, and dripping, juicy clementines. Its fruity but dry, sweet but torturing, and indeed, exceptional. And it is nothing like the wits I know (and love) in flavor either. Dry, bright and excoriating! The first taste is somewhat sweet, and even features some pear notes, but it dries very quickly, leaving a hoppy astringency and orange pith and coriander. This screeching dryness begs for food, but by itself this wit offers a wild, engaging ride - something that I can rarely concede for other regular wits. Another Mikkeller win.

4565,"2012-03-22",3.4,"Odd aroma of makeup and roses, accents of coriander and oranges. The aroma could pass for an older womans perfume. Opaque amber, thin head. Unripe orange flavor, lemon zest. Tangerines are discernible when quaffed. Subtle notes of lemongrass and grapefruit peel are also present. Violet seems rather prominent. Bitter and floral for the style.  Rose petal finish. Filmy mouthfeel. This certainly isnt just another wit. Strongly hopped, but not with hops one would expect to be paired with the typically fruity notes of a wit. Outrageously complex, but it seems like too much, especially for a wit. With so much going on, its easy to find something to like, but equally as easy to find something to dislike. Lacks direction and cohesion. This is probably an example of a White IPA that seems to be the new fad, but this beer exposes a vulnerability in marrying an IPA and a wit. That is, the style itself is already complex and needs no complicated hopping regime to muddy the waters.  It should probably only be single hopped.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by a medium white head
In long: The nose is something that Id describe as pastry/bakery next to a bouquet of flowers.  I like a full malted body but this one is more like a big yeast dough.  Not unpleasant at all, just, you know, very thick.  The beer is incredibly yeasty but with very little fruity esters.  Taste is bready, doughy, floury, bakery, wheat.  A whole lot of floral hops and light fruity notes of apricots and citrus lighten up the experience.  This is a different beer.  It was very different from any other so-called imperial-witbier Ive had.  I really liked it although I must admit that most of my enjoyment came from its uniqueness.

Concentrated wheat, coriander, orange juice meet soapy, perfumey, floral and zesty aromatic hops. This is a chewy wheat beer with a thick cerealic/wheaty palate. Its massive hop dose procures more aromas than bitterness, yet the bitterness is quite intense, bringing on a profound dry-out effect which quickly gather a cementy, stoney feel. Fat and oily palate is fortunately punctuated by fit effervescence which at least manage to impart some drinkability. Lots of alcohol  wave through the whole flavour development.

4565,"2009-07-25",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Doughy yeast and citrusy, resinous hops coalesce in this fresh, creative and classy Imperial Witbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam protects the cloudy whitish gold.
-The hop character is vibrant, yet it never overthrows the wheat beer character.
-This is very drinkable for its size.
-The resinous hop bitterness is levelled with the rest of the flavor profile.
-The bubbles are big, but remain comfortable throughout.
-The spicy, herbal, resinous, citrusy hop diversity is the perfect match for the Witbier it decorates.

4565,"2009-05-24",3.5,"2008 Bottle; Sampled April 2009
A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a four-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head that is nice and long lasting and leaves a nice thick lace on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a bright gold color that shows hints of haze and a brighter gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma has an expressive, sweet orange zest note as well as a grassy, cracker like grain note.  The citrus aromatics are really the dominant note here; it is refreshing, but can seem a bit simplistic at times.

Sweet grain flavors mix with tart citrus notes (more than just orange, with some Meyer lemon notes) up front.  The finish has an astringency to it that is a bit like the pin in a citrus fruit, slightly tannic and bitter.  The finish also has a bit of spiciness to it; a earthy pepper not as well as a sort of green coriander flavor is noticeable.  Actually, speaking of green flavors, this beer actually has a green, sort of vegetable flavor to it.  The flavor is a cross between a bell pepper and a leafy herbal note; this last reminds me of a mix of basil and kefir lime leaf.  The flavor is spice and citrus dominated, but the grain does contribute a back drop of grassy wheat flavors, some sweet grain notes and a dry, cracker like grain note in the finish.  The body is a bit heavier than a standard strength Wit, with a touch of viscous heft and a noticeable body, but it is still quite quaffable and refreshing.

This is an enjoyable beer, especially if one is fond of Wits.  It is not overly complex and could certainly use some more fermentation complexity.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The flavor starts fruity and spicy with lots of esters (pear, melon), lots of grassy, herbal, citrusy hops, and a nice, light, grainy, malt sweetness. There is something slightly medicinal about the combination. At mid-palate, the bitter citrus and grassiness strengthen along with a good bit of coriander and licorice-like esters.

4565,"2009-04-25",3.8,"My Mikkeller of choice today is a Belgian Ale brewed with Spices which has now been clarified as a Witbier, aka Belgian White. It is not at all uncommon for Belgian and Belgian-style ales to have natural flavors of spice, wood, and such due wholly to the natural yeast strains and brewing processes. It also isnt unusual for those mischievous Belgians and their inspired cohorts to add a little extra punch of flavor, complexity, and uniqueness to their beer with the addition of spices, fruit, and so on. But that is a whole other barrel of brew for another discussion on a different day.


She poured a hazy golden-orange with a huge head gracefully adorning her beautiful colors. Appearing like a heavenly cloud descended, she fades slowly into soft tufts while sprinkles of lace adorn the sides of my glass. Wafting gently my way, her heady aroma of tart lemon and grapefruit, spices, clove, coriander, nutmeg and slightly funked sourdough and yeast seduces and woos. Divinely sublime, our lips meet in an effervescent kiss wet with yeast and sourdough speckled with spices. The spices act as a soothsayer for the tart character of my Mikkeller, mellowing some of the initial tartness and sour funk. Surprisingly, her finish has a sweet touch of sweet grass and dry hops. As my Mikkeller warms, more peppery spice and coriander adds zest while my palate slowly dries, leaving me thirsting for each subsequent tart quaff. There are a lot of things going on within this beer, yet she is amazingly quaffable with an amazing refreshing character. All good things must come to an end though, and as we bid each other farewell, I am left with one final embrace of tart citrus, sourdough, pepper spice and coriander so nice, marked by a seductive sweet nip.


Most impressive is my first foray into the brewery Mikkeller. I havent had any of their other offerings so I cant say if this is one of their best or their average fair, but I certainly wouldnt say mediocre.

Thick pillowy white head holds steady atop a cloudy pale gold body. 
Fruity nose, seems somewhat hop driven with a bit of grassy citrus rind that just screams Amarillo. Some pepper and coriander spice in the works, touch of tropical fruit too.
Moderate carbonation, nice big full body that isnt too burdensome for its strength, creamy texture leading to drying that seems derived from unmalted grains rather than alcohol.
Really nice hop driven flavour upfront. Being a hop im VERY well aqquanted with, Amarillo seems to standout prominantly with passionfruit, grapefruit and grass character. The spices linger in the background, coriander an obvious choice, but clove and pepper are certainly worth a mention, bitter orange peel sneaks its way in with warmth.

4565,"2009-03-12",3.8,"750 ml ""champagne"" bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.6%. Hazy golden colour, big and lasting white head. Distinct but not overwhelming aroma of orange peel, coriander and fruity hops. The flavour comes through like a cross between a Belgian witbier and an American Pale Ale or IPA (which indeed this beer might be said to be). The American hops (Amarillo and Cascade) dominate, while the European ones (Goldings and Saaz) are harder to identify. Theres a grapefruity and slightly resiny and peppery bitterness, but the orange peel and coriander also come through. Alcohol is noticeable. A good beer, as expected from Mikkeller,  but I still think witbiers and APAs / IPAs are decent enough styles in their own right (when brewed well), and Im not entirely convinced that the brewing world needs a new wave of ""imperial witbiers"". Props to Mikkel for doing the experiment, though.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

Flavor:  loses points here mainly because the hops are too strong for this style; now, I am a hophead so I dont mind this; in fact, I love this beer, but in terms of conforming to the witbier style characteristics, it does not; therefore my overall impression is high and the other categories will lose some points

The nose is yeasty with notes of honey-melon, some metal, soap and orange peel - a freshness that suits it. The taste bares a  hoppyness that seems unfamiliar to the wit-genre - its rather complex taste with citrus-notes alot of yeasts, coriander-seeds, american hopas that is both fresh and gives a bitterness in the end with a sparkling palate that bubbles on the tounge.
