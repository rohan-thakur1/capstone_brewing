4422,"2017-06-11",4.4,"(Sample shared by a kind stranger @ Koelschip, May 11/17) Pours a hazy reddish colour with no head. Notes of super super juicy peach, dried stone fruit, almost berry like, citrus zestiness, cheese and barnyard funk profile, light oak, firmly sour, with a long fruit finish. Medium bodied, light carbonation. Magical, one of my very favourite Bokkereyder beers and one Im sad to have only had a sample of so far. Hope to cross its path again, when I expect I will boost my rating...","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

4422,"2017-01-24",4.4,"750mL bottle shared with Nelson at Akkurat on 12/1/16.Large, raspberry-gold-flecked white head shows good retention atop a near blood red body that is well-carbonated and shows high clarity.Peach notes of all sorts with skin, juice, acid and a strong lactic and tart, lightly citric Brett character behind it. Funk and mineral are explosive with tart juiciness adding to the intensity. No flaw or alcohol.Big bursts of peach skin and tannin mix with juicy depth and tight, spritzy carbonation as lactic and brett acids collect on the finish. No overabundance of sourness, though plenty puckering. Those peaches are just stupendous and the mouthfeel and attenuation are near perfect as well. Juicy and fruity as all hell but its so deliciously flavorful, I dont even mind that the lambic character takes a slight backseat. Turns out when you blend great lambics with hand-picked top notch fruit, things go well.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
