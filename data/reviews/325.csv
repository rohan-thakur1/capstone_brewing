325,"2015-07-10",4.8,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2015 Renowned American barley wine, with creamy, moussy, light greyish beige head, breaking in instants; colour hazy copper with ruby hue. Powerful and enchanting bouquet of sweet cherries soaked in brown rhum, ruby port, white pepper, vanilla, Hennessy cognac, candied figs, Belgian chocolates, candied orange, strawberry, oaky tannins, hints of mocha ice cream, caramel, almond, roasted coconut. Intense taste profile beginning with lots of candied, but not sticky sweetness, raisins, candied cherries, hint of orange, softly tingling carbo with velvety, vinous mouthfeel, noble sourish touch, smooth caramelly, slightly nutty with a lovely milk chocolate touch to it, while the initial candied sweetness lingers on; finish is a reprisal of all this, but with drying oaky woodiness added, a dash of citrussy hop bitterishness and of course a deep warmth of brandy- and bourbon-like alcohol, perhaps very slightly burning on the root of the tongue, but not disturbing at all; wonderful bittersweet, warming barley wine, not as hoppy as many other Americans in the style and therefore better suited in the English barley wine style, which, from what I read, is indeed the intention.

There are tons of malts and a beautiful vanilla character. Beyond that the dark fruits and a nice bourbon carry it through the end. The flavor is pretty malt forward, and very good. The caramel and vanilla mesh beautifully with the oak and light bourbon. The malts take a back seat to all of the alcohol heat. The mouth feel is velvety and nicely carbonated. Really smooth. The aftertaste is lingeringly malty with a good bourbon character and a nice vanilla. Excellent barleywine.

I don¬ít much care for many English-leaning beers. Sucaba is all of those things, yet so damn delicious. The beer is thick and ruby in appearance with a huge head. Time has cleared out the body. The massive aroma is sweet, but tastefully so and endlessly complex. There are notes of vanilla, oak, sherry, earth, dark fruits, raisins, toasted brown sugar and bread. The palate is huge and boozy in a very good way, not the way the burns, but rather nicely warms me up and commands slow-sipping enjoyment. All these sweet flavors don¬ít come across as sticky or sugary they just delightfully intermingle. All the character is harmonious and balanced with a tasteful oaken, sherry note. The flavor is much like the aroma but really brings out the notes of standing in a humidor. Ladies and gentlemen, this is how you do a classic barleywine.

Beautiful rich aroam, heady malts, some coconut. Normally that coconut would be a very bad sign, but this manages to get away with it somehow, and the richness of the roasted malts and woodiness are make up for almost everything. Very sweet sticky palate. Nice malty but a bit yeasty. Coconut less obvous in the taste. Smoothish, and a nice sipper. Did like coming back to this glass in between subsequent beers, as the aroma was a reset that would put a smile on my face.

This is just insane how great this beer is on nearly every level. The intense amount of flavor depth combined with the olfactory input is really something to appreciate and admire. Waves of rich, butter-toffee, vanilla, wood, chocolate, thick caramel syrup, and coconut cake batter fill the nose with just a light twinge of alcohol showing up. Stunning. 

The complexity on this is just mind blowing. It reminded me in a lot of ways of Apis P√≥ltorak Jadwiga, with it¬ís multiple layers of flavors, each meshing with each other in an orchestra of wonderful flavors. Bounding flavors of bourbon, oak, vanillin, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, butter-scotch, leather, and Captain Black pipe tobacco.

Super smoothe. Alcohol is incredibly well blended in, as it manifests itself more as a light spice than any sort of heat. Not sure if that¬ís it being a year old or if that¬ís just the masters at FW doing their thing. Mild carbonation doesn¬ít get in the way of the sticky, medium body.

 Poured from bottle (2013) into a snifter

 Appearance ¬ñ The beer pours a super deep copper color with thick tow finger of tan colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell ¬ñ The aroma of the beer is quite a caramel and toffee smell mixed with a ton of fruit aromas ranging from darker stone fruits to lighter fruits. Apple, cherry, raisin, are the strongest with hints of other fruits within. A good deal of oak and lot of bourbon booziness are there as well creating a very warming smell overall.

 Taste ¬ñ The taste begins big caramel and butterscotch flavor. A big bready and doughy flavor is there as well. A bourdon and vanilla flavor begin working their way onto the tongue along with the caramel and toffee transitions to a molasses and brown sugar flavor. A ton of oaky bourbon booziness hits the tongue toward the middle to the end of the taste with some dark fruit flavors starting to be sensed as well. The booziness gets a bit hot at the very end and is combine with a bit of a herbal and earthy hop flavor to leave a very warming and sweet flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel ¬ñ The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both are quite appropriate for the style and match the huge sweet and boozy of the flavors rather well, making for a rather slow sipper. 

 Overall ¬ñ A bit on the boozy and oaky side with a ton of sweetness. A rather robust Barley wine. Not one I would likely frequent frequently, but a nice on to try none the less.","","Darkmagus82"

The appearance is dark brown (almost black) with light red highlights around the edges, one finger white foamy head slowly concaves and clings to the sides of the chalice, some light clingy lacing spider webs a bit but falls eventually.

The taste is mainly sweet and sticky through the previously mentioned flavors, light caramel coming out. There is some sweet sticky aftertaste with a sweet dry finish.
On the palate, its about a medium to heavy, not sessionable - this is one to be sipped as the alcohol is felt pretty well. There is an adequate carbonation as well.

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation.

A - Pours a dark brown/mahogany color with red highlights. 1 finger of off-white head forms a thin collection of wispy patterned bubbles below a solid collar.

T - A swirl of roasted wood, sweet vanilla, dense toffee, sticky caramel, toasted fruit bread, leather, spicy hops, whiskey swirls around notes of chocolate cherry cordial, amaretto, and rum. The whiskey components grow stronger as it warms, making the finish drier and drier. Some spiciness shows up toward the warming finish.

M - Starts out firm and full but turns medium and softens out, low and fine carbonation.

325,"2014-01-12",4.4,"the best barley wine I¬íve ever had. It¬ís just a joy for the senses. It pours with a lot of color and body, holding the glass to the light reveals deep, warm blood-red and cherry, with plum and bronze when the light hits the edges of the glass just right. There¬ís no real head, and at almost 13.5% alcohol, I didn¬ít expect a lot of suds. The aroma is nose music. Cherries and figs, ginger, chocolate, and something in there reminds me of granny¬ís cornbread (maybe the highest compliment I¬íve ever given a beer). And what this beer does for the mouth is even better than the smell. I¬ím not a wine guy, but this brew reminds me of the few red wines I¬íve enjoyed. It¬ís rich, smokey, very, very full and warm. I picked up on strong chocolate, anise, espresso English walnuts, and a little burnt popcorn thing, too. There¬ís something that reminds me of Nutella in the close, after the swallow and exhale. It¬ís so complex, but all of it blending and harmonizing perfectly. Barley wine can be sticky, viscous, and that¬ís the quality about the style that I enjoy least.

Pours clear mahogany with a small tan head that fades to a thin remnant and leaves a small amount of fine lace. The nose has big notes of molasses, oak, vanilla and bourbon, along with tobacco, cherry and dark fruit. The flavour is quite sweet with lots of molasses, oak and chocolate, along with subtle tobacco, vanilla and earth. The finish is long and malty, with vanilla, molasses, oak and subtle alcohol. On the palate it is full in body with a syrupy texture and soft carbonation.

A: Pours a dark cherry mahogany ale. Less than single finger of light tan head falls to a broken sheet of the same. No lacing. When agitated, head replenishes and then falls once again. 

S: I like the way this smells. Sweet vanilla, nougats and caramel. Some hints of cherry. It reminds me of a white chocolate Idaho Potato Cherry flavored candy bar, if you know what I mean...

T: Plenty of sweet butterscotch, vanilla, oak, cherries. The alcohol is a bit hot here. The taste profile is less than impressive, but with a year or two on it, presuming the toffee tones in the malts would come thru, this would be world class. As it warms, the alcohol continues to have more and more presence, not cool.

M: A bit thin for the style IMO. Carbonation is moderate and persistent, not bad, would prefer a little lower. 

O: I think this is a nearly exceptional barley wine. I might pick up a few more just to age them, but I have less than high expectations for this to continue to excel. It will either thin out and fail to build the smooth feel I really appreciate from good BW¬ís, but then again, you never know. I¬ím nearly on the fence with this. It¬ís good, but not terrific.

Aroma is a wallop of sweetness coming in at all angles. Candies abound of the butterscotch, caramel, and toffee variety. An undercurrent of searing booze hides underneath the decadent aroma, and it adds another component of booze-soaked dark fruit (cherries). Further scents of oak and vanilla arise. The flavor pretty well follows suit with the aroma, but the booze is in greater abundance particularly in the finish than the aroma had led it on to be. Flavors here are a strong dose of coconut, toffee, sugared raisins, possibly dates, caramels, oak and bourbon. Very sweet and cloying. Mouthfeel is far thinner than expected, carbonation is a bit higher than expected, and the searing heat of booze that carries on through the finish was expected.

325,"2013-03-20",4.2,"On tap at the Common Table. Hazy brown with no real head. The aroma is absolutely awesome. I get a ton of maple and vanilla as well as some bourbon and caramel notes. The greatness continues in the flavor where I get all of the notes from the aroma, as well as some dark fruit and brown sugar. All of the notes meld very well together with the oak adding tons of character to the beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Amazing beer and super happy I got to try it. Hopefully I see it on tap again soon.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

325,"2013-03-13",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2014 Three Part Cellar Review
Part III
Sucaba bottle, bottled January 3, 2013.
Appearance: The body is clear with a great ruby to mahogany hue. The head is thin with poor retention that settles into a thin ring.
Aroma: On the pour the nose is nicely balanced with coconut, oak and bourbon coming through. After it¬ís sat for a moment the coconut is dominate with dark fruits and toffee backing it.
Taste: Sweet malts on the intro with a strong mid-taste of bourbon, oak, coconut and brown sugar. This is a bit hot at the moment, but very drinkable.
Palate: Thick with a syrupy texture and moderate carbonation.
Overall: This is great, there¬ís no doubting that, but after my vertical it seems that Sucaba is best with a few years on it. This is very drinkable fresh, but it certainly benefits from a year or more on it.
Part II
Sucaba bottle, bottled January 5, 2012. ~1 year old.
Appearance: The body is clear and a deep mahogany with garnet hues, a beautiful color. A thin tan head foams up briefly, but settles quickly into a thin foamy coating.
Aroma: The aroma is strong on the oak at first with a touch of bourbon on the first smell. Upon swirling I smell some booze, vanilla, and faint coconut coming off a bit musky.
Taste: This is very sweet and syrupy right away with a strong toffee flavor intertwining with dark fruits. The oak and bourbon are very light, only appearing on the finish that lingers a bit after the sip coming off a bit hot.
Palate: Thick and syrupy with slightly sharp carbonation.
Overall: This comes off a bit too oaky and unbalanced on the nose than the 2 year old one and a bit unrefined in the flavor. It¬ís great, but it isn¬ít as good as the 2 year old one.
Rating: 7, 5, 7, 5, 15
Part I
Abacus bottle, bottled February 18, 2011. ~2 years old.
Appearance: The body has good clarity and a beautiful garnet/mahogany hue. Little lights comes through the body, it¬ís very dark. A short tan head escapes the body but quickly settles into a foamy ring.
Aroma:The aroma is sweet, a touch musky even. Brown sugar and toffee dominate the nose with dark fruits. The barrel notes are subdued providing a light vanilla and a touch of oak, very little bourbon is noted.
Taste: Very sweet, this drinks like a cognac. Lots of caramel and brown sugar with medicinal dark fruits overlying the sweet syrupy thickness. The finish has a bit of alcohol, hinting at the bourbon, but very mellow with a lingering syrupy fruit finish with a strong coconut presence.
Palate: Thick and syrupy, light carbonation.
Overall: I had this fresh once and from memory I think fresh is better. This is excellent though and has certainly aged very nicely. I think of this as sipping on a nice cognac rather than a beer. Well done.

Mouthfeel falls somewhat shy of what I¬íd expect of a beer of this strength in terms of thickness, but the sweetness doesn¬ít become cloying and the flavours are nicely balanced.

325,"2012-10-10",3.0,"2012 vintage. Dark brown pour with ruby tinges and a gentle, mostly fading beige foam. Deep, sugary, very fruity and rich nose where an intense fig perfume comes across as jammy to the max and holding nutty, earthy, highly toasty nuances. In mouth, the first thing to hit me is that despite the focused fruit in the aroma, there is very little acidity at play here. Synchronously, there is very little bitterness involved. It makes for a beer that is certainly rich, but tiresome in its intense vanilla-laden sugaryness that does not convey quite the humongous depth these very sweet beers need to be successful on my palate. Were it veering more towards a sourish vinous character, I¬íd dig as it¬ís full palate and self-assuming soft carbonation are spotless. At the same time, while it¬ís a 12.5% offering, I should not expect a subtle alcohol presence I guess, but here, it is fairly invasive, accentuating the caramelly angles with a blast of heat, one that becomes more and more apparent as the beer warms up. Plenty of dried fruit sugars in the finish, one that lasts and keeps warming up. Well... it sure got some merits and that brewer generally has one of the most trustworthy names in the business, but an average above 4 when there are so little of those strikes me as surprising.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

T: The taste is like the nose, but much better. The barrel comes through much more with a great oakiness and sweet vanilla combination. The dark fruits I smelled are present here as well, but take a back seat to everything else going on. There is heat present from the alcohol, but it is wonderfully integrated and not overpowing in the least bit. It finishes with a light, semi-sweet chocolate.

325,"2012-08-25",3.4,"22 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Time to see how this one stacks up to Parabola...it¬ís a cool, pleasant day for July standards, so why not?

A: Pours a dark ruby color with some hints of sediment hiding in the dark body. The head starts off as a one finger heavy cream color, before fading into an extremely thin ring in no time flat. Not the prettiest beer by any stretch, but it works well enough.

S: Nicely complex - darker fruits, some orange flesh, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, sherry (I saw a little rust on the cap, might be a sign of oxidation), and booze. I have to give points for its interesting aromatic qualities, even if all the notes aren¬ít quite my cup of tea. 

T: Strong dark chocolate, coconut, and vanilla notes comprise the flavor on its initial sips. The bourbon barrel qualities are the best part of the experience - which is good, because the barrel infuence kind of overpowers the barleywine itself. Caramel, toffee, tobacco, and dark fruit intermingle with the barrel flavors, with different sips accentuating the barleywine and barrel at different intervals. It¬ís balanced nicely. The finish lacks staying power; a little more in the way of lingering residual sugar would be welcomed here, though some caramel notes can be found on the aftertaste. Overall, it¬ís enjoyable and decently complex - but also pretty damn disappointing.

M: It suffers the same problem as Parabola, it¬ís too thin and overcarbonated. This one seems to warm the orifices with booze a little more than its sister, and the feel lacks the richness and decadence I wanted it to feature. On the plus side, it¬ís easy to drink/sip this one. This one improves as it warms up (both in flavor and mouthfeel), though it becomes boozier, as well. Best course of action? Serve it from the fridge, and let it warm up a bit before drinking, so the oaky tannins help provide a decent lingering dryness before the booze becomes too evidently expressive.

O: Did someone say hype? The barrel flavors imparted into this are fantastic, but the beer itself fell WAY short in comparison. Altogether, it makes this one good, but it sure as hell isn¬ít the end all be all. I¬íd still bite the $17 bullet again, if only because I want to see how future batches compare.

Comparing Sucaba to Parabola, the latter wins handily, though that might be due to my bias towards imperial stouts talking. Note to self: find out what brand of bourbon barrels FW use, because I¬ím really liking the general bourbon flavors the two beers impart, more than the base beers, in fact. I still finished the whole bottle in a sitting - that must mean Sucaba did something right for my tastebuds.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

T-- Syrupy butterscotch, bourbon, touches of oak, vanilla and noticeable alcohol. Gums got numb on first few sips of the beer. 

M-- Thick, syrupy and slightly jam like. Get some notes of strawberry jam in the mouth. Bourbon and the barrel are really apparent in the mouth as well. Bourbon alcohol finish to this with touches of jam like qualities. I think starting to turn into a malt bomb. Medium full body and slightly more carbonation than it needed. A bit prickly at times.

The color is a beautiful dark ruby, as stated on the label. The head is rather small and fades rapidly to virtually nothing, leaving some faint lacing on the glass.

The aroma is inviting, with scents of bourbon, malt, caramels, and oak.

Delicious! Balanced? Oh yeah. Flavors flow together beautifully. Brown sugar, caramels soaked in bourbon, oak barrels, hints of vanilla.

The feel is truly exceptional. The beer goes down effortlessly, with nary a hint of the supposed 13% abv. It would be no problem to finish a bomber unaided. No need to age this masterpiece, as it¬ís already silky smooth.

Overall, a terrific beer and a stellar example of a barrel-aged barleywine. Highly recommended.

Appearance: Sucaba pours a really dark reddish amber. A slightly muddled mahogany but when held the light it¬ís quite clear. There¬ís almost a purple hie inside. It¬ís quite mesmerizing. A beige finger head is gone in a flash.

Smell:Oak, bourbon, chocolate, coffee and fig are all here and are dissected easily. It¬ís really sweet smelling but the burn of alcohol is still slightly present on the finish.

Taste: The powerful flavors of oak, bourbon and figs stand up front and mix together well while easily being taken apart. As she crosses the center of the tongue, caramel and a flavor of pie crust start to shine. They¬íre quickly cut out but chocolate and oak rounding out the back. The alcohol is just barely there throughout it all. Remarkably smooth for 12.5%

Update. Same beer, bought the same day. It¬ís been in the cellar ever since. 2012 edition. Rating date 3/31/15

The beer pours a ruby brown with a very thin beige head that immediately disappears. Aroma is oak, molasses, brown sugar, and a lot of dark fruit flavors. Raisin, date, and plum are there big time. There is also a slight spicy smell in the back and faint bourbon aromas. Taste is very complex. I¬ím having a hard time focusing on all of the flavors because they are so intense, yet have tons of subtleties. I get a lot of dark fruit. Plums, figs, dates, and raisins are all represented nicely. There is a caramel sweetness and a ton of molasses as well. It¬ís kind of like a holiday fruitcake. I also pick up some oaky notes in the finish. The beer is very sticky in my mouth and the flavor lingers on forever. I literally mean forever. I¬ím talking 5 minutes in between sips and I can still taste flavors of dark fruit and sweet molasses. It also gets rather dry near the end. This was a great beer fresh and even better after 3 years in the cellar. I just wish I aged two of them.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Thechasm442"

A: Sucaba pours with a wonderful frothy light brown (think milk chocolate) head that is average in size (about 1 finger). It¬ís head diminishes without staying around long at all. There is some lacing but does not stick to the glass very long. The color is murky brown to ruby red on the edges and bottom upon holding it up to the light. 

S: Maple sweetness, vanilla, toasted oak, tobacco, and lots of bourbon. Wow lots going on here in the aroma. Next I get the dark fruits like raisin, plum and maybe some dark cherry. The sweetness is evident and wonderful. Brown sugar and toffee come to mind next. Lastly I do pick up some tobacco.

T: The taste does not disappoint and follows the nose like I was hoping! I first taste a wonderful combination of bourbon and sweetness that intermingle in perfect harmony together. The dark fruits (plum, raisin, prune and date) take center stage and then the vanilla and oak make their appearence. I must mention the alcohol is very much there and warms and stings the mouth and tongue urging me to take another sip!

M: This is medium on the palate but just right in my opinion. It is alcoholic like I mentioned in the taste but just awesome. Sticky comes to mind as I continue to sip as it does coat my mouth nicely. This allows the flavor to linger for a looong time and I¬ím lovin every minute of it.

The flavors are nice and you can tell that this was aged in multiple barrels as you get some really nice complexities from the different barrels. This beer is very well-made, but at the end of it one thing remains true - BA Barleywines are just hard to make in a way that excels over the top. The Barleywine style just poses such a lack of complexity in the brew itself that it is entirely dependent upon the barrels. This was very well-done, and my hat off to Firestone.

325,"2012-03-25",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2013 650ml bottle 2012 vintage.

It pours a dark reddish brown with a fizzy but foamy tan head that actually sticks for a little bit and then recedes with no lacing.

The smell is great. Boozy and boubony, I am beginning to like hotter beers with more of a bourbon kick. This one has an ample malt and barelywine backing though, a ton of dark fruit, rich malt flavors, and a bit of hops shine through. The yeast character is indeed English giving it a profile that isn¬ít often had in big BA barleywines, usually they are more american yeast tinged.

This one is really thick, wow. It has a good vanilla, coconut, and oak vibe that is the main hit I am getting. Instead of boozy this one is as velvety smooth as it gets at first sip. The sweetness is never too cloying but it creeps up with the alcohol as you go. Nice hop, tobacco, and dark fruit flavors as well as a great malt bill. The bourbon itself is readily noticeable lending a spirit-like vibe.

325,"2012-03-20",4.6,"The beer pours a translucent, deep, dark ruby color with an average, khaki, pillowy head which settles to a fully lasting, firm, frothy layer and leaves some similar lace.  The nose is very nice, very smooth for a 13% beer; plenty of coconut, bourbon oak all over, Belgian chocolate, light peppery spice, faint cherry, toasty vanilla, and some tobacco.  The flavor is drastically different with a prominent spicy bourbon role that lingers all the way to your belly; tobacco, vanilla bean, toasted oak, molasses, light Belgian chocolate, some coconut, and a slight raisin note.

Just a very well built, blended, bourbon-aged, strong, BW with unique character, unique complexity, and a prominent bourbon strength that only accentuates the uniqueness of the beer.  It was amazing how the nose was rich and smooth yet the flavor carried so much of the spicy bourbon notes and warmth.  This one was so smooth in the nose and bold in the flavor, it makes me curious how it will age.

325,"2012-03-15",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/26/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter.

The appearance of this beer is more similar to an old ale than a barleywine. A dark chocolate brown is a bit transparent in the thinner parts of the glass. A small off-white head struggles to form originally and fades to nothing fairly quickly.

The aroma simply bursts out of the glass. Tons of vanilla, caramel, bourbon, oak, and a bit of spice.

The flavor starts out with a very nice and complex gooey caramel that never gets too intense or cloying. A bit of roasted malt, some spice, and then a smooth bourbon, vanilla, and oak presence that carries through the finish. Incredibly smooth and balanced.

Although the alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor, the alcohol creates a tingling sensation on my tongue and warms the back of my throat and stomach. The carbonation is pretty much perfect; creamy and moderate. Definitely on the full side of the body spectrum. Slightly sticky.

This is not one of those beers that has nearly infinite separate components; it is a relatively simple beer that is made impressively well. The bourbon really accentuates the wonderful flavors and adds some complexity itself.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Well...it has the expected traits that score big points among most beer geeks...lots of alcohol, lots of sugar, and bourbon.  If our subculture can be pegged for anything, it¬ís for liking ""big"".

325,"2012-03-10",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Strawberry jam, wood, caramel and alcohol heat coalesce in this classy behemoth, as leafy hop bitterness builds a levelled finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the blood red.
-The soft effervescence gives a lot of room for the malts to express themselves.
-The mouthfeel is not too fat, which I appreciate. I would not call this a lean Barley Wine either though¬Ö
-The flavor profile may be powerful, but all flavors remain in line.
-This was not a most m√©morable Barley Wine, but it remained a mighty efficient example of the style.

A - Deep red/brown body. Small white head which quickly dissipates to a still body. Legs, but there is minimal lacing or retention.

S - The bourbon and oak are very dominant. The finish is fruity. Caramelized figs and plums and sweet malts.

T - Alcohol is dominant but smooth and not overpowering. Taste is heavy on the bourbon and dark fruits. Medium carbonation and body. Maybe lighter than I would have liked.

O - A very delicious barrel aged barleywine. The only fault I found was that I wished the body was a bit heavier to support the flavors.

2012 ¬ßucaba (the beer formerly known as Abacus), Batch 2. Poured into a tulip glass and reviewed on 09-01-2012.

A - Same as the 2011 but with a longer lasting head.

S - So chewy and toffee heavy. Smell is just very much in the english style with some fantastic barrel notes of bourbon heavy vanilla. Finishes with an alcohol warmth and some caramelized fruits and some spice.

T - Chewy toffee, burnt caramel, vanilla, oak, dark fruits. Still just as tasty as the first batch. Mouth feel is also still a tad on the light size.

O - This beer is very much a booze bomb. Its one of the hottest beers I¬íve ever had, but it works the same that a fine bourbon or scotch works. You just sip and enjoy the deep complexity. Its very english with a strong and chewy toffee aroma and flavor that seems to meld right into strong bourbon barrel notes.

This one pours a nice and rich cherried wood in color with a light and fizzy khaki colored head which quickly dissipated. The aromas consist of sweet and ripe dark fruits, figs, light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, and port. It smells pretty good but I could use more bourbon. The flavors are almost exactly what I was looking for tonight. You get a lot of buttery biscuity malt (yet not as intense as a California Chardonnay), light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, figs, and it has a rich and resonating after taste.

Incredibly smooth flavor showcasing the bourbon, vanilla, and coconut and with layers of chocolate and smoke underneath.

325,"2011-09-09",3.0,"Poured into a snifter. 2011 vintage. Thanks to psiweaver for this.

3.5 A: Clear (I think) deep brown, nearly black color. One finger of fizzy head falls quickly and leaves no lacing.

4.5 S: This nose has it all and by that I mean it has a big hit of bourbon AND a very respectable beer underneath. The bourbon is lightly leathery with perhaps a touch of peat. Also included is a moderate fruitiness that borders on the floral, good bit of vanilla, and nearly as much oak. Lots of caramel and toffee with plum, prune, date, and fig fruitiness. Brown sugar and a very reasonable booze level for the ABV. Really complex and pleasant. Borderline 5.0. 

3.0 T: I can¬ít believe what I¬ím tasting. This beer has such a nice nose, but the taste is straight up boring. Boozy bourbon with a light charred, peaty flavor. Still a decent amount of vanilla and oak. The beer itself is the problem with the taste. The taste follows the nose for the most part, but all the dials are turned down to a three from what were eights. All subtlety is lost behind the booze. Really disappointing and certainly not better than average. 

3.5 M: The mouthfeel is indicative of what is problematic with this brew. A 13% barleywine had me thinking thick, velvety, and rich. Having had Parabola a few times, I figured that was the route this would go as well. Instead, this has a medium body and a moderate creaminess. Seems like the potential malt flavor went away with the potential heavy body. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. 

3.5 D: Totally disappointed. I loved the hell out of Parabola and thought this would be the barleywine version of that. It isn¬ít. Not quite sure how this is getting the scores it does. Maybe bottle variation. Who knows? Not confident this will age well, but I have another bottle and I¬ím going to give it a go.

325,"2011-08-17",4.3,"Served on-tap at Capone¬ís during the Firestone Walker Lunch party. Enjoyed with Dave Walker himself! Served into a snifter.

A - Pours deep brown with a thin film of white head, dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lacing down the glass. This was served WAY too cold. Once it warmed up a bit it got a little better.

S - Smells of warm bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, tobacco, and chocolate sweetness offer some contrast to the typical caramel / toffee sweetness in most barleywines. The heat began to creep in more and more as it came to room temperature.

T - Lots of toffee sweetness up front quickly giving way to a mix of bourbon heat, tobacco, chocolate, and vanilla. Finish is a mix of sweetness and alcohol burn, lingering for some time. This one is still a little raw but I can see it developing over the next few years into something amazing. I need to grab a bottle of this one as soon as I can.

M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. It was pretty thin at the beginning but it really developed once it warmed up into a rich, creamy, feel with plenty of lingering sweet heat in the finish.

Taste is big toasted coconut, vanilla, wet oak, burnt caramel, rum soaked dark fruit, booze, and sweet malt. Body is thick and full while being borderline syrupy. Mild alcohol warmth and a soft, bubbly carbonation. Finishes with more vanilla and toasted coconut along with sweet malt, light toffee, toasted caramel, oak, bourbon/booze, and fruit notes.

325,"2011-06-09",4.3,"22 ounce bottle.  The aroma on this has some nice bourbon notes.  Not too sweet.  More of a woody, barrel character in this.  Some pitted fruits and raisins are also detected.  Some leather and tobacco are also in this.  A very decadent aroma that is reminiscent of North Coast Bourbon Old Stock.  Fantastic.  Moderately transparent ruddy-mahogany body with a bit of a smallish off-white head.  Decent legging.  Starts fairly sweet with some brown sugar flavors, before some bourbon takes over in the middle.  Tobacco, some roastiness also follow.  There is also a dry woody, barrel character.  This finishes a bit boozy and somewhat ethanolic.  A little harsh around the edges, but still really tasty beer.  Not quite in the class of Bourbon Old Stock.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Lacing is minimal, and after awhile, it dissipates and leaves a clean, flat surface. Aroma is heavy on dark chocolate, ripe cherries, vanilla, lightly roasted malts, molassess, and some slight grapey, yeasty notes. Rich, velvety body with a sort of loose, well-rounded mouthfeel. Almost chewy and yet very juicy. Finishes with a slight burn and bit of roasty cocoa flavor.

325,"2011-05-28",4.0,"On tap at Capone¬ís, Norristown. Lucky to have been in town when the Firestone event was going down, and thanks to Matt and Craig for saving me some samples! Very fine pour, ruby-to-mahogany spectrum, with a thin but fine and frothy head that lingers, leaving nice retention. Body appears to be a bit oily, but not at the expense of appropriate carbonation. Nose is powerful, with heavy bourbon the dominant element but with notable vanilla, mild fruit, toffee, a hint of molasses perhaps, like a complex liqueur. Body is quite full, not from carbonation but from sheer substance. Flavors are as complex as the nose, with wood, sherry, vanilla, and very intensely combined and integrated malts all coming together like a port that has elements of a mildly hoppy strong ale or old ale. Really a terrific beer, but the only knock for me was that the bourbon was too promiment throughout for my tastes. Even so, an easy 4.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Nose is the definition of depth and complexity: caramel, toffee, booze, bourbon, vanilla, wood, some candied coconut, slight cherries, and some joy also.  Flavor is similarly wondrous: this one manages to tread the line of too bourbony very well, like a gymnast walking over croc-infested waters.  Flavor gives notes of wood, brandy, bourbon, cherry, marshmallow, vanilla, toffee, and a big alcohol presence that is not unexpected, but shows in the wild, long legs.

Pours a deep dark copper/chestnut color with dark ruby/mahogany edges and a one finger frothy off-white head that quickly settles into a thin lasting ring. Sporadic small spots of lacing left behind.

Amazing complex nose with a blend of earthy oak, luscious vanilla, sweet boozy bourbon, dark fruit and earthy/leathery malt. The barrel character is very prominent with lots of toasted oak without smelling burnt. Sweet bourbon and lots of vanilla and marshmallow mellowing things out. As it warms the malts become more prominent with hints of leather, toffee, hazelnut and caramel. Slightly vinous with hints of cherry, grape and plum. Smells amazing and the bourbon is well integrated in the nose without overpowering the other elements.

Medium bodied with the perfect balance of earthy barrel character, boozy bourbon, sweet malt and alcohol heat. Very similar to the aroma with a prominent barrel presence up front. Earthy oak that is slightly toasted with sweet bourbon flavor that is prominent but not overly hot. Although the bourbon flavor is strong, it¬ís not overpowering and the other flavors are able to stand out. There are also notes of vanilla and toasted coconut from the barrel, mellowing things out. Slightly hot with some nice burning warmth in the finish but the ABV is pretty well masked at 13%. Underneath there is a nice blend of earthy/leathery and sweet malt flavor. Slightly earthy barleywine flavor with hints of sweet caramel toffee, rye and faint cocoa. Vinous with dark fruit flavor, especially dark cherry as well as some grape, plum, raisin and fig.

Simply one of the most amazingly sophisticated barleywines I¬íve ever tasted.

In another six months when the heat has subsided, this will be a true masterpiece.

This beer arrives from the tap with a dark, concentrated amber / brown color that shows a clear¬íish hue in the light.  It is topped by a thin, creamy textured, dark tan to amber-tinged colored head.  Bourbon aromatics jump out at me from the get-go; notes of vanillin, coconut, a hint of woody spiciness, lots of oak-wood like fresh cut plank aromas and even a touch of alcohol heat are noticeable.  The aroma is quite nice, but leaves me wondering were the aromatics from the base beer are.

The beer is sweet tasting as it first hits my mouth, with a viscous, chewy character that finishes with a hot alcohol and Bourbon spiciness that lingers on the palate; it actually does remind me of sipping on Bourbon.  There are lots of flavors reminiscent of vanilla and toasted coconut; wow, the Bourbon barrel really just completely dominates this beer.  Luckily the malt is big and sweet enough to carry all the barrel character, but you better really like Bourbon if you are going to enjoy this beer.  The base beer really plays a subservient role here.  The Barley Wine does contribute a lush texture, with caramelized malt sweetness and some toasted malt character.  The beer finishes with a really spicy, almost hot at times, peppery barrel character that lingers on the palate for quite some time.

The vanillin and coconut notes are nice in this beer and it is well accentuated by the malt sweetness, but this is too hot and too Bourbon dominated in the end.  If you really like Bourbon then I can see this being quite the enjoyable tipple, but it is perhaps a bit too much for me.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

It¬ís a much more delicate and complex bourbon aroma than most bourbon barrel-aged beers.  Bourbon and oak dominate a bit - not that I¬ím complaining in this particular case - but there are some wonderful malty fruit flavors lurking beneath and even some chocolate and vanilla.  The fruit notes come out even more in the flavor.  It¬ís sweet but not cloying.  It tastes of malt sugars refined by barrel-aging.  The beer is thick and warming.

Definitely a sipper, but a great one at that.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"

Aroma of sweet caramel, some dark fruit (plum, grape, fig), a soft yeastiness, and some moderate spicy bourbon.  Smooth, sweet entry with strong hints of caramel, a bit of toffee, and some spicy bourbon and undertones of plum and fig that finishes moderately dry with some vanilla, oak, and a bit of alcohol.

325,"2009-02-22",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2012 Sampled at Toronado 2009 Barleywine Festival.
This is the second beer I¬íve had at this event that has simply floored me with its silky rich yummy goodness. Pours deep amber to near dark brown and micro thin tan head. Wow! Another knee buckler aroma with a smooth blended mixture of wood, molasses, rich dark fruity esters and more rich molasses. The wood notes become mildly brighter upon further inspection. The taste is just amazing with some smooth bourbon flowing into deep rich dark fruity esters accented with well rounded smooth wood notes. Just a smooth beer that gets almost velvety for a while. It dries out a tad into the finish.
Seems to be way barrel forward in 2012 as compared to the draft version I had back in 2009. I¬ím not liking it nearly as much.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Dark, alcoholic fruit and a little dark chocolate.   Pretty low carbonation, and an oily, slick body.   The alcohol component is pretty strong, and the roasted chocolate flavor almost suggests an irish coffee, but this is far better.   Pretty dark barley wine, but interesting.   A good sipper.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
325,"2008-03-06",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2014 Rerate 3/17/14: On tap at Beercraft in Rohnert Park. Dark copper with a thin tan head. Deep pudding and coconut aroma. If I liked coconut at all this would be outta sight. But I don¬ít. Flavor has rich caramel and wood, vanilla and coconut. Really well balanced and smooth for such a massive beer. Hedonically I can¬ít get too excited due to the coconut but otherwise this is a pretty perfect barleywine. Changing my old score of 3.8.


Original rating 3/6/08: On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz.

10 oz pour into a small tulip pint glass. Deep auburn in color, with a certain coppery shimmer that only high alcohol beers have. Minimal head with no lacing.

Smell is very strong and sweet, sort of like a less extreme Utopias. Whiskey is the main note, maybe with some dark fruits.

The flavor here is really similar to scotch but with less alcohol bite. Peaty and oaky, with lots of sweet malt and booze-soaked fruit.

Mouthfeel is too low on carbonation but the viscosity is spot-on for a big bad barleywine and the finish is shockingly dry on the tongue.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

325,"2007-01-02",2.9,"Sampled at the FOBAB.  Perhaps it is because this was the first drink of the day but I found this to be an astringent and hot alcohol mess and it seemed a bit watery to boot.  The Bourbon masked almost all of the barley wine qualities and the bitter hops were all that made it through.  No thanks.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ElBorracho"
325,"2006-12-31",3.9,"FoBAB 06: Dirty brown hue with sunset highlights and a lasting frothy head. The aroma has notes of old hops, tobacco, smoky and earthy malts, plum, phenolic, and more towards the British styled Barley wines. The taste starts with a smooth toasty malt forefront supported by grassy and peppery hops, olde skool oxidation, and a hint of alcohol. The finish is kinda sweet and sugary but not interfering. The mouth feel is dry, woody, and a tad chalky. Very nice overall, more towards style, I dug it enough to use 2 tickets on it.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
