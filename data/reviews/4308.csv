4308,"2017-05-13",3.5,"From a beer hawk mystery case. Pours clear and golden. Thin head. Nice fresh hop smell. Says it's a lager but I would say more like a nice craft bitter. Lovely bitter hop finish.

4308,"2015-11-08",3.4,"Bottle from Appellation Wines Comely Bank.
Appearance - golden with gentle bubbles and a proportionate head.
Nose - grapefruit and fresh sweat.
Taste - more of the same. Quite pithy.
Palate - light bodied with a creamy yet bitter middle section and a fairly fresh finish.
Overall - I loaded this as a Helles as there wasnt team bitterness of a pils even though the dry hopping gave bitter citrus fruit.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
