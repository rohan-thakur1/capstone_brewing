Classic hazy coppery brown colour. Nice bananaey aroma. Sweet. Some toffee. A bit sticky, but thats what I demand in a sahti. Alcohol well covered. Surprised to see its 9.5%. A quirky one, rather pleasant.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2171,"2015-04-08",3.1,"33 cl bottle @ Kerho, Tampere. BBE 03/2015.
Pours murky brown color with no head, lots of yeast on the bottle too as expected. Juniper and bready malts on the nose, some herbs and yeast. Malty, somewhat fruity flavor, faint banana sweetness, some sourish berry notes, spices and yeast. Some mild house flavor can be found also. Alcohol stays hidden. The sourness might be due to mild infection, and its not very fresh, but its not that disturbing here. Not the best Sahti Ive tasted but decent.

Dark brown. Overripe bananas, light chocolate roast, yeasty fruity easters, bit of a rubbery mud cake on nose. Full bodied, light oily texture. Malty sweetness, junipers in flavour, soft roasty, chocolate-banana cake finish. I like the idea. Find it much more approchable than the patent-black sahti beerhunters did. Softer, chocolately. Fits better with the banana esters. Bit rubbery, but nice.-- bb","FINLAND","jookos"

Aroma has salmiac, licorice, fruity yeasty tones and some odd, familiar aroma. Also strawberry jam. Flavour has licorice, ashy tones, strawberry jam and tobacco. Finishes with strong juniper notes and warming alcohol kick. Quite ashy stuff.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
