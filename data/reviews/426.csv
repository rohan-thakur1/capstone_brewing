426,"2017-05-28",3.5,"Can from Hippo. Hmm. Its a bit niche for me. Cream soda in the nose, for sure. Given it a 7 for that, though Im not sure how difficult it is to just make a beer that smells of cream soda. Looks lovely in the glass - Mother Earth stuff always does - but overall a bit confusing for me. Tastes of cream soda then it tastes of beer then it tastes of cream soda.

426,"2017-04-13",3.3,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle. Its tough to tell if the bottle code is a date, but it looks like it may be from June, 2016; thanks Whole Foods! :( 
Aroma has moderate honey notes with some lighter corn. Quite a bit of vanilla character. No hop aromas and just some faint floral esters. 
Pours a fairly clear, golden color with a small, moderately thick, white head that recedes to a film that lingers for quite some time. Moderately high lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet upfront and a bit sweeter mid-palate, but it finishes drier than I was expecting which is nice. Medium bitterness in the finish. Light honey and corn notes. No hop flavor. Medium vanilla notes, but definitely less than in the aroma. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and somewhat crisp, but a bit flabby on the edges with moderate carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, better than I was expecting, but I also had pretty low expectations. The vanilla is too strong in the aroma, but it is better in the flavor. Flavor has a bit of a weird transition from front of palate to mid and late palate.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

426,"2014-04-08",2.8,"When you buy a cream ale, I suppose you should expect a cream ale. The cashier at Costco seemed to think this bottle was generating a great deal of local controversy and agitated mumbling, so I thought Id give it a try and see how the beer version differed from the canned, sugary and carbonated version I essentially grew up on. And minus a little sugar? I cant say theres much of a difference. Cream ale, it turns out, tastes a great deal like cream ale. It has that distinctive sweeter element, marshmallow on the nose, a moderate to lope carbonation, and a taste that is more than nostalgic - its almost identical to root beers younger and slightly less social little brother. Like some fruit ales, its hard to think of this as a true beer, though I am glad to have tried it.
