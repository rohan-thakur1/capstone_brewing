1952,"2015-05-18",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2015 [As Dreadnaught 8/11] Bottle, 12C. Black with an inch of tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, grass, earth, mild spices. Slightly syrupy. Sweet with dark toffee, chocolate, some burnt flavours, licorice. Bitterness is there and nicely in harmony with the beer, but struggles a bit with the sweetness until the end which leans evermore towards dryness and is a little spicy. Lowish carbonation is insistent and works well. A little sweet for me but harmonious and tasty. [3.6][As Return of the Dread, 5/15] Bottle, 11C. Black with a tan head that fades to a cm then is less than a coat. Vibrant aroma of chocolate, anise, vanilla, blackstrap molasses. Lighter bodied and less sweet than the original Dreadnaught, to its advantage. Silky, lowish carbonation. Chocolate, spices, molasses, ""high"" roasted notes. Bitterness is quite high, but theres nothing disjointed about it. Alcohol is dangerously well-hidden. Not a great deal of depth, but very nice and pleasingly hoppy.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

No light penetrating this. half finger of dark mocha colored head that went from film to a few brown gurgles in less than a minute. Much better staying power on swirling as got a finger of head but still died quickly. Spotty lacing left while drinking and a slight bit of oily residue. 

S-- Sweet dairy milk Carmel chocolate with coffee to back it up. Lots of malt sweetness to this but the smell is quite soft and have to really swirl the glass to bring it out. 

T-- Bitter, dark and rich baking chocolate mixed with a bit of Belgian sweet chocolate. Good contrast to the nose and much more pronounced. 

M-- At times oily, sweet, and sticky. Big gap in the middle of the palate leaves a big whole but rounded out with sweet chocolate coffee acidity to finish. Medium body and lower medium carbonation.

The flavor found sweet black patent, molasses, and honey malts at the core, with vanilla and light smoked malts emanating outward.. the same hops from the nose plus toast stuck around the mouth, and paired with dry-roasted, smoky malt on the finish.
