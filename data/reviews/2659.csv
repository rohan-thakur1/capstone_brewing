2659,"2017-04-15",4.3,"22 ounce wax capped bottle, bottled on 8/1/16. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours very dark brown with some ruby red tinges, along with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is good, and theres a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and sweet, the brew smells like molasses, caramel, vanilla, dark fruit (red grapes/wine, plums), oak and some whiskey. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres the addition of some roasted malt, cognac and dark bready flavors too. Its mostly sweet tasting but not overpoweringly so. Not quite as boozy as I expected for being 14.3% ABV. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its slick and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation.

2659,"2017-02-18",4.6,"Waxed bomber. Bottled 8/1/16, about six and a half months ago. Aroma is dark fruit/raisins/red wine grapes, oak, molasses, minerals, tree bark, tea, alcohol. Pours mahogany with a collapsing beige head. Taste is lightly sweet with flavors matching the aroma, along with chocolate, leather/tobacco, cola notes. Hides the huge ABV really well. Weirdly thin for such a big beer, but it doesnt seem detrimental. I was expecting a typical blend a la Firestone Walkers Anniversary blends, with a heavy emphasis on imperial stout and/or barleywine. This is a completely different beast, with a only a touch imperial stout, a touch barleywine. Seems like the quad influence of The Stoic is most represented here, followed by Fred, then Doggie Claws, then the Abyss. Amazing.

Only some sparse lacing. Aromas of lots of dark fruits especially raisins, cherry, raspberries, plum and prunes. Following that, theres roasted malt, caramel, toffee, oak, vanilla, molasses, chocolate and whiskey. The Pinot character seems to come out more as it warms. Tastes of chocolate and cocoa at the beginning followed by some dark fruit, mainly raisin, cherry and prunes. In the middle there is some red wine coming through before finishing with caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, molasses and whiskey. Full bodied with light but prickly carbonation and light alcohol warmth.

2659,"2017-02-02",4.7,"As the name would suggest, Collage 2 is the result of mixing several random-ass beers together... like a liquid cyborg. Like any self-respecting cyborg, it wears dark colors and was probably sent from the future to kill you. Collage 2 smells like a malt bomb. Charred barley, toffee, fruit, vanilla, wood, candy sugar, vinous booze - it all comes together in a weird aromatic stew. Flavor is strong, yet theres a surprising amount of sweetness. Dark fruit, caramel, licorice, grape, oak, and cream. Its surprisingly smooth for 14.3% but theres definitely some alcoholic heat. Its such a strange drinking experience. It really does taste more like a sum of parts instead of a cohesive beer. Usually, I would say that like its a bad thing. In this case, its so damn intriguing that you have no choice but to keep coming back. Each sip seems different.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

2659,"2017-01-09",4.0,"14.3%ABV. American strong ale.

Poured out dark clear brown. 32°SRM

Nose has sweet ume, wood, alcoholic smoke that suggests bourbon. There is a medicinal element to the nose that suggest liniment and Chinese rubbing ointment. Chinese preserved plum in the paper and plastic wrapper.

Mouthfeel is syrupy. Alcoholic palate is so well balanced that you dont really notice which becomes more pronounced over time and subsequent tastings. Palate is caramel, treacle, dates, raw honey, burnt sugar, creme brûlée. The finish flavor at the very end is that of red dates. Middle of the palate is preserved dark fruit with prunes, plum preserves with a fruity, sour, broad flavor but without freshness. There is also a creamy component

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and wine/spirit barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and whiskey/oak spiciness balance; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish.

Medium light oak with some light alcohol warmth. As it warms more of the alcohol notes form the barrels comes out including the red wine and cognac. 
Pours a clear brown color with amber hues and a medium sized, medium thick tan head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers. No lacing and fairly long legs. 
Flavor is very sweet with lots of caramel, toffee and burnt sugar notes. Lighter chocolate and molasses with some faint roast and leather. Medium bitterness.

Overall, a decent beer but the malt and fruit profiles dont do it for me. The alcohol is well hidden but the sweetness is a bit over the top and too sugary.

Big abv is present here too, considerable warming throughout. Rich, dark chocolate malt dominates the taste up front, in spite of the lighter body color. Roasty molasses, pecan, coconut, vanilla, and oak all show here. This is really good, though I think it does need more time to develop. Flavors from Abyss and Doggie Claws dominate, while the boozy Stoic and Fred notes seem layered on the back and separate. This should mellow and meld a bit with age, certainly enough malt and booze to facilitate that. Will revisit in a year or two.
