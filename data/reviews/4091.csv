4091,"2015-10-04",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2015 On tap at 4:20 pub in Rome-Italy. Pours deep golden semi clear, minimal gassy bubbling foam lowering fast. Nose: passito wine, macerated grapes, fermentation. Mouth: wow! Really dry, sour, white wine, complex. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","Rome, ITALY","ippopotamo36"
4091,"2014-07-18",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Nut skins, haystacks and prevalent mustiness lead to agreeable acidity in this pleasant Lambic experiment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the blond haze.
-Drinkability is quite high.
-The soft bubbling and polite sourness make for an engaging mouthfeel.
-The Pineau des Charentes barrel doesnt seem to be doing as great work on the Boon base lambic as the Brunello barrel.

On cask at Brasserie 4:20.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

4091,"2012-03-25",4.1,"16/12/2011 Brasserie 4:20 (37 months old, on tap). Bevuta al Sour Winter Festival. Dorata, brillante, con riflessi ambrati chiari, schiuma assente. Aroma molto delicato, acido con note dolciastre date dal vino fortificato, e sfumature erbacee e balsamiche, di bosco. In bocca è acida, morbida ma allo stesso tempo complessa, con intense note erbacee e balsamiche sul finale. Corpo medio, consistenza vellutata, vinosa, di grande raffinatezza, carbonazione soft. Una carezza.","Rome, ITALY","Mortlach"

Aroma is stunning and delicious: loads of fruityness mixed with acidic and vinegary notes. Taste is more ""traditional"" with horseblanket and funky notes mixed with sourness and some citrus and dust. No carbonation and oily body. Very nice one and super tasty.","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

4091,"2011-03-28",3.1,"On tap at The Trappist in Oakland.  Somewhat hazy golden-orange color with minimal head.   The aroma is nice and funky with barnyard, lemon, and cereal grains, with a hint of rubber.  The flavor is little rubbery, maybe with a bit of diacetyl.  Good funkiness, oak, and pale malt character though.  Medium-bodied and flat, more or less, which is not a bad thing for an unblended lambic.  A fine beer but does not quite stand up to some of the better examples of the style.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

4091,"2011-03-05",4.0,"Draught  Surprisingly stable, small rim over pale amber beer. Surprising (sorry, again) mix of liqueur and Bretts, quite some unidentifiable fruit. Barnyard, saddlesoap flavours, fresh citrus, and obvious lambicky Bretts. And balanced at that! Light, refreshing, and light acidburn. Excellent lambic, even if only the nose points directly at the barrels.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
