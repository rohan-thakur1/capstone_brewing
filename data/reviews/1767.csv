S: The smell was very mild, but solid. Pale malts with a little bit of nuttiness and a little bit of roast. There was some mild citrus flavors in the background.

T: The taste was much like the nose. Pale malts that were slightly grainy in nature with a little bit of caramel sweetness as well. Mild citrus rinds and light hoppiness round it out.

M: Medium bodied with a very lively mouthfeel. Carbonation was a little much for a beer that supposed to remind me of winter.

O: This beer had some decent flavors, but it could have benefited from a little more caramel malt flavors and a little less carbonation. Overall a solid beer though.

1767,"2005-12-10",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2007 12 oz bottle (rerate)
This a rerate of this beer.  I picked up another bottle while on a single run to Rileys.  My original score of 3.2 was not far off the mark.  This is an average to possibly just above average beer.  As it is a seasonal, wait until November/December then pick up a few bottles.  If you are looking for a session beer that is not heavy but provides some flavor this is one that will be perfect.
Aroma / Appearance - A huge billowing head resulted from an aggressive pour.  When it settled not much was left floating on the top of a deep orange (possibly bronze) colored body.  The nose underneath was not as strong a hint of bananas as I remember but it was there.  Along with it was orange rinds, peanuts and a trace of simple hops.  Some soapiness detracts from the overall experience but not by much.
Flavor / Palate - The body is very thin and watery even for a vienna.  The taste of banana nut bread fills the palate briefly before it fades on the throat.  An unusual taste of vegetable stew flashes across the palate before a simple finish.  On the whole this is extremely unmemorable but safe.  If you want something to share with non beer geeks this is a local that might be a nice gateway to other beers.  Just dont expect much from it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1767,"2005-12-07",3.4,"Bottle.  Poured a clear amber with a small head.  Plenty of malt on the nose with hints of caramel and sweet peanut brittle (did I say peanut brittle?  Now I truly am a geek).

1767,"2005-05-16",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2006 2004 bottle from Robertsreality, thanks man!  Pour is a deep amber-orange, with light cherry red hues.  Transluscent, low filtration.  Its very refreshing to see light filtration on a lager.  Off-white head is small and rapidly receding to a cluster of large bubbles.  Aroma of yeast, bits of burnt grains, lots of toasted grain, a hint of acidity and perhaps some light strawberry-like fruitiness.  Flavor begins with a meaty, sourish yeast, somewhat crisp on the end, with lightly bitter/nutty hops, very low in apparency.  The main show, is the malt, which is well-done and shows plenty of husky, toasty, biscuity vienna malt.  Only moderately sweet, it is made that much more of a session beer, with some light honey and marmalade tones as it warms.  Toasted grains finish, with light yeast and bread.  Lightly watery body, low, lazy carbonation.  I could definitely drink a number of these.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A distinct roasted flavor and the thin red-amber color give this away as a winter seasonal, but what truly stands out is its intricate aftertaste.  Going from roasted, to tangy and mellow, and then to slightly sweet and crisp, this beer packs in a bewildering amount of taste, although nothing stands out in paticular besides the roast.

1767,"2004-12-26",3.4,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2004 (12 oz bottle: The Cellars in Roseville, MN) Here in America, with the word ""winter"" in the beer name, Ive been conditioned to expect a darker, heavier beer than what Im getting here, but I knew going into this beer that its a Vienna style.  A very caramely, moderately sweet, lightly toasty maltiness is the dominant flavor, with a relatively mild hops bitterness lending some semblence of balance.  The nose is very malty, with some honey sweetness as well.  Medium bodied with a nice round mouthfeel and plenty of carbonation, but the sweetness gets a little tiring on the palate.  Dark amber in color and fully clear.  The off-white head has good size during the pour, but it dissipates rapidly down to a thin sheen and rim of foam, leaving some patches of lace scattered around the glass.  As Viennas go, this is flavorful, fairly malty, somewhat balanced and not sickeningly sweet, so its definitely worth a try.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Lusciously fills the mouth, sweetly greets the tongue, hapily floods the palate, very smooth, very tasty. Thick and substantial, a warm and rewarding brew. I'd forgotten how good this is, and I need to head out and restock before it goes away again. 
I tried it last year and thought, :""eh, I don't like ""winter lagers""...now, I don't know what I was thinking then, this is just about perfect.

1767,"2003-12-04",3.5,"I have had a couple of different experiences with this beer.  Out of the tap it had a great spice flavor.  It had a great balance of malt and hops and was moderately sweet.  The finish was smooth.  However, I recently had one out of the bottle and was disappointed with the aftertaste.  It had a little bit of a cough syrupy aftertaste.","Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, USA","jburbey"
1767,"2003-11-30",4.1,"An excellent, fairly mild spice flavor, much less imposing than the other winter beers I've had, and probably my favorite of the bunch.","Le Mars, Iowa, USA","bbrock81"
1767,"2003-11-29",3.9,"Pleasantly sweet aroma with a hint of warm spice.  Leafy, spicy hops without the sweet malt onslaught that I was expecting from a ""winter"" lager.  A simple enough brew, but I really enjoyed this one.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
1767,"2003-11-04",3.4,"A clear copper/amber color with a thin white head.  Very good nose of malt, caramel and a hint of fruit.  The flavor is roughly the same with a bit of green apple. A good beer, although uninspiring.","Apple Valley, Minnesota, USA","Nexxus"
1767,"2003-10-31",4.1,"Gourgoeous copper color. Nice malty, caramel aroma that is very sturdy and appealing. Medium carbonation and a spritzy head that fades fast. Nice malty back bone, with some very subtle spice notes. Little if any hops, but that seems appropriate in this beer. It's nice having a winter beer that's not all cloves, spices and hops for a change. Nicely done, by a great brewery.","Waconia, Minnesota, USA","davesarman"
1767,"2003-10-11",3.4,"12 oz bottle pours visual and nicely clear amber with a good head and some lace.  The aroma is pretty malty with some spice for the winter.  The flavor is malty and warming with very little to balance in the way of hops.  The palate is rich.  Overall, this is good for a plain Lager.  I'm glad I got the bottle to try, but I'm even happier I don't have a sixer to finish off.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
1767,"2003-07-28",3.4,"I have to play this one from memory.I had only one bottle of it and drank it last night and never rated it,DOH.I guess the main thing that i remember is that it was quite good in color taste and over all would be a decent brew to have more of but in this case my Bro-In-Law dropped the ball and gave me only one Sigh so I will rerate after i manage to procure more in sept.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
1767,"2003-07-18",2.5,"Perhaps its a lager, but it comes off more like a poorly made pale ale (too many esters and burgeoning flavors). Color is a deep amber, topped with a frothy, big-bubbled head. Flavor is light maltiness, apple (?), and a bit of leather. Aroma is Brach's Milk Maid caramels left on your dashboard all summer, wrapped up in faux Smucker's Butterscotch ice cream topping. Enshrouding all is a sort of dank moldiness...which is somewhat interesting, as is the light touch of sourness. Sweet with no purpose (like pain with no gain). Passable, but nothing special. I can't believe this was fermented at lager temps. I don't know what the alcohol content is, but the ethanol is prominent throughout the aroma, flavor, and finish. Finishing bitterness but just a smidgeon of non-resinous hop flavor.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"
1767,"2003-06-24",4.2,"Color is a clear amber with a thin off-white bubbly-foamy head that fizzed away after a minute and had some light patchy lace. Smell is very nice, its a sweet fruity delight of green grapes along with a bit of apple and peach and has a smoothing sweet malt backing. The smell and taste was very close to Hales Wee Heavy Winter but just a tad lighter. The taste is mild and light with a clean, sweet, smooth malt with a very slight and mildly bright hop thats citrusy/tangy, just a bit of green grapes and apple; all very subtle and smooth. Feel is light bodied and silky smooth, has a interesting light tang hold that reminds me of a wet wine and gets barely dry in the finish. This is very drinkable and is a very subtle, intesting beer.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
1767,"2003-06-16",3.4,"Somewhat hazy golden color.  Quite a bit of carbonation, not Belgian Ale carbonation, but a fair amount none the less.  Quickly diminishing head.  Sweet aroma, kind of like a cider.  For being a lager, this tastes great.  Slightly hoppy bitter with some malt characters.  Tasty.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
1767,"2003-06-05",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2004 Copper color with a small head. Malt and caramel aroma. Flavor of malt, caramel, hops and some bitterness.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Darkover"
1767,"2003-05-26",3.1,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2003 Bottled. Amber coloured with creamy head. Roasty and malty with clean mouthfeel and grassy bitter finish. Good to see a Swedish word on an American label...","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1767,"2003-04-12",3.5,"The color on the pour a limpid deep copper, the head portly in size, frothy in texture and a nice light tan color, as it dissipates the lace left behind seals off the glass. Personally I think this a sign of a well-brewed beer, along with the bazillion tiny bubbles lifting from the bottom of the glass. Nose malt and lightly sweet, musty and a tad yeasty, fresh and pleasing the nose on this beer. Start sweet, lots of malt top moderate in its feel, finish has a delightful hop spicy presence, the carbonation tolerable and the aftertaste somewhat dry, quite a quaffable brew it is true.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1767,"2003-02-26",3.4,"I like a beer with a name like Skal--it means you have no expectations.  If this had been a ""winter lager"" I think I would have been dismissive from the start (though I should know better with a brewery of Capital's abilities and renown).  My wife loves this beer--very pleasant mouthfeel, aided by nicely balanced levels of malts and hops, with a bit of tang and a bit of spice.  Yes, a very basic, yet pleasing combination.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1767,"2003-01-23",3.4,"Never had a skal before. I like it. Thin head but with a pleasant dark apple juice color. Sweet, somewhat fruity nose. A bit of peppery spice hits the tip of your toung first followed by some sweet malts. Smooth mouthfeel, typical of the brewer. Wonderful crisp finish with some lingering spice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

1767,"2003-01-14",2.9,"Nice nose, very malty.  Clear, slightly amber in color.  Good sized head that fades away quickly.  Malty in that British nutty-toffee sort of way.  Finishes unpleasantly medicinal.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
1767,"2003-01-05",3.3,"Smooth and creamy palate.  Flavors were an alcoholic Werthers toffee with added herbs.  Not unpleasant, but too sweet after awhile.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

1767,"2002-12-29",3.4,"Perfumy, heavy hop aroma. Small, off-white, mostly diminishing head with fair lacing. Hazy, sparkling, amber body. Moderately bitter, features notes of peat reminiscent of those in Shiners Winter Ale. Mellows a bit as it warms. Not bad.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1767,"2002-12-27",3.0,"Bottled.  Appearance is the best thing about this, lovely red with a lasting creamy head.  Kind of weak smoky/peaty aroma; flavor also on the dim side, earthy with a hint of maple, little hops, smooth quick finish.  Not terrible, but not up to Capitals standards.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

1767,"2002-12-25",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2004  Deep chestnut brown W/ ruby hues, (sound familiar?)decent off white head, poor retention. Sweet fruity nose with some spices too! good complex aroma.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel with drawn out finish.  Spicy notes kind of creep up out of nowhere.  Balanced very well.  One of Capitol's best bottled brews.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
1767,"2002-12-24",3.1,"Interesting, moderately malty and hoppy aroma.  Has a touch of spice to it, but is otherwise standard and kinda dull.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

1767,"2002-12-14",3.8,"A deceptivly pale beer for the malty punch that it packs.  Like allmost everything Capital makes it is brewed very well and speaks of good quality ingredients and techniques.  Light caramel and a good alcohol punch make it a fine winter beer, but it is somwhat lager like and I am not sure if the English Strong Ale catagory is a good standard to judge this fine beer by.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","Northernbrewer"

1767,"2002-05-31",3.5,"A really great beer with no defects. If there was anything Id change it would be a touch more body and possibly some more late hop character - but OK as is. Id like another. I think the Winter title implies a little more than the English Strong Ale category can really deliver.","Pennsylvania, USA","NeroFiddled"
1767,"2002-05-25",3.4,"Crystal clear light amber. Small foamy edge head. Zero carbonation. Faint toasted caramel popcorn aroma. Medium body. Popcorn malts with some light caramel sweetness. Very slight herbal hop flavor. Lightly flavored, like a Vienna light. No hint of alcohol besides a mild alcohol spice kick. Begins to smell like an Oktoberfest. Finishes with a toasty sweet maltiness. Good session brew, but a thin Winter seasonal.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
1767,"2002-04-24",2.3,"Pale copper color; Fluffy head- looks like whipped cream; Nose has cornmeal and cinnamon?. Am I missing something here? Tastes heavily of adjuncts. Very Malt-Liquor like.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
1767,"2002-04-03",4.1,"Ill rate the 2001 version.  I really like this recipe.  A nice copper color with a solid head.  This years seems to be a little young and could have used a few more weeks of lagering, ah the pressures of getting shelf space.  A really nice malt flavor, I believe begium aromatic malts give this smooth mouth feel (kind of like rye).
I look forward to tapping the keg in my refrigerator in a few weeks to see if the extra aging help.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1767,"2002-02-08",3.4,"It seems like all of the Capital beers are starting to taste the same, which isnt a bad thing.  A bit too mild to be classified as a winter brew, the mix of malt and hops is great as always.    Also seems a bit pale in appearance.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","scrawfis"

1767,"2001-12-13",3.0,"Malty (amber style) aroma.  The color of a slightly used penny, although quite clear and brilliant.  Normal head/carbonation.  Somewhat like a cross between an American Amber and a British Bitter Style.  (Is it an ESB?)  Slightly sweet caramel amber flavors, quickly giving way to somewhat spicy hops.  Rather dry finish.  Medium bodied.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1767,"2001-11-14",2.9,"Decently malty lager with odd spicy notes.  Tastes like ther is a little bit of nutmeg present, which is odd considering that the label does not claim that the beer is spiced.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
