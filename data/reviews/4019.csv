4019,"2016-04-24",4.2,"Growler shared with my brother at his place in New Hampshire during a visit to the US. Pours clear yellow-gold with a thick, frothy white head. The nose has nice peach, piss and pithy tangerine. Light to medium sweet flavour, with nice juicy peach, melon, tangerine, light piney bitterness. Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. More bright and juicy hops coming through in the finish, some pee notes, melon, more tangerine and peach, mellow balancing sweetness. Really great stuff overall.

4019,"2016-01-17",4.0,"Poured from a 750 mL flip-top growler shared by Gus. Thanks man! The pour is a foggy golden yellow with a nice thick white head and a dense cap of the head left. The aroma is heavy hops. There is a bitterness and a light funk that is strictly mosaic hops. It's hoppy and bitter and just what it says it is. The flavor is also heavy on the mosaic funk. There is a big hop and a light malt. It's just big and hoppy. The mouth feel is good. Nicely carbonated but it's a little syrupy on the back end. The aftertaste is lingeringly mosaic funk with a light bitterness. Not bad.

4019,"2016-01-13",4.3,"Tap. Hazy bright light marigold, with a creamy foamy white head that lasts forever. One of the best expressions of the Mosaic hop Ive come across in terms of the aroma: kiwi rind, sherbet, melon and tropical fruit. Flavor is much more bitter, a little catty, but melon rind finish and quite fruity. Palate is creamy, soft, and sparkly light carbonation. Crushable.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"

La robe est trouble; la mousse peu tenace mais de magnifiques vestiges sur les parois de mon verre témoignent de son passage. Une tonne de fruits frais déborde de mon verre alors que je penche le nez au-dessus de cette bière provenant de cette brasserie que jaffectionne au plus haut point. Cette bière ne fait pas exception à règle: La Maison ne verse que dans lexceptionnel. En bouche le houblon est proéminent. Lamertume intense, crisp, sèche et tranchante ne révèle toutefois pas les saveurs fruitées avec autant de complexité que ce que javais préalablement senti. Cest profondément amer et pamplemoussé.

The aroma was the star if the show for this brew. Excellent!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","dlovell2"
4019,"2015-10-23",3.4,"On tap at The Reservoir, Waterbury VT.
This was poured into a tulip, so take with grain of salt since its not in correct or respected glassware. Heres the rest.
The appearance was a glossy burnt yellow to orange color with a bar pours kind slim white cap of a little head, no lacing, but Im not worried.
The smell starts off with resinous bitter hoppiness with an underscore of pine to balance.
The taste was just a tad sweeter than the bitter side in the respect of taking the resinous bitter hoppiness to lead into sweet citrusy bliss. A sliding citrusy aftertaste running into the same sort of finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a slick oily bitter semi-sessionable feel on my tongue.
Overall, its a pretty good APA, but Im just wishing people and Sean Hill could get past this hipster bullshit of pouring beers into stemware. Sean, please come back to beer reality, dude, a pint glass is totally fine with an APA, please do your research.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

4019,"2015-07-02",3.7,"Beautiful hazed marigold, with licks of lacing up and down. The initial burst of mandarin fades to rind bitterness, quickly, with earthy, green notes surrounding it; coriander, yellow bell pepper, other herbs. Fruit notes are quieter. The flavor carries the seedy, tannic notes of berries and citrus, often leaning toward papery bitterness, though remaining refreshing and lean. Quenching, crisp body that snaps in the finish; dry and wooden. Too shadowy, papery, ultimately somewhat bland, considering.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4019,"2015-05-17",4.4,"Pours thick unclear juicy orange juice bright golden and thick peach with a white head. The aroma is so pleasant with sweet citrus like hops, sprtizy and tamed juicy zest. There is more citrus from the mosaic hop in the nose and flavor than i have ever gotten in other single hop pale ale of this breed. The flavor is so smooth and full bringing lemony citrus hops and vague herbal but still sweet notes on a full body for the lighter style and ABV.
