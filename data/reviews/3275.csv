3275,"2017-03-25",3.8,"Bottle @ home. Looks amber and a bit cloudy with a small white head. Smells sweet and herby with a small hint of malts. Taste starts off with sweetness from the cognac, caramel and red fruit to be followed by malts and overall just a slight but very pleasant bitterness and hint of sour. Overall, a very nice beer that I would happily recommend.","Oirschot, NETHERLANDS","Bobson"

3275,"2017-03-12",3.7,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, orange, grain and spices.

Appearance:

Clear/hazy golden/amber beer with a medium off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, Belgian yeast and orange; ends slightly bitter and dry with grain and spices.

Overall:

This beer is intense and balanced, but lacks complexity. Great sweet flavour thanks to the loads of Belgian yeast. There are only some spices in the finish to create a balance. Shamefully it is very filtered, guess that could have fixed its flaws.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
3275,"2017-03-11",3.7,"W aromacie to, co ma być, czyli oddrożdżowe przyprawy, zboże, lekkie muśnięcie owocowe, bardzo to lubię. W smaku smukły, wytrawny, wyraźnie przyprawowy, owocowych nutek mniej. Nieco alkoholu. Bardzo pijalne, świetnie skrojony, choć w moje preferencje trafia połowicznie. Wolę bardziej cieliste, gładsze, zaokrąglone triple.","Katowice, POLAND","mgajdaczewa"

3275,"2017-01-20",3.5,"Purs clear blonde, good white head. Smell is mellow maltyness, mild hoppyness. Not as crispy, not as fresh as the regular version. Taste is sharp, higher carbo than expected ( on the virge of to high ) the hoppyness I truly like in the basebeer, shines way less here I dont really get a lot of the previously ( ratings ) aspects, unfortunately. perhaps its me, or is there bottle variation ? The beer isnt boozy, and theres for sure nothing wrong with it. yet, I prefer the soft, balanced, mild creamy hoppy taste from the regular over this","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

3275,"2017-01-14",3.4,"Draft glass @ Gollem. Lightly hazy orange, creamy white going to off-white head. Nose is sweet grain soup, massively sweet banana, crazily sweet, excessively, unpleasant Belgian esters mixed with banana bread. Apparently they dry-hopped this one with Cascade, totally not getting that. Taste is banana both puree & green banana, excessively yeast, unpleasant stale slab of yeast, cheap cornflakes, excessively yeast, unpleasant grain, poor esters, green leaves & excess of sugar. Body is cheap cornflakes, sugar, grain. Not a fan, bad excessively overly heavy, overly ester heavy tripel. Cognac BA version was stupidly better, this needed to be fixed.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

3275,"2016-10-30",3.7,"New extra version of Schuppenboer, thanks Jan for sharing. Very thick and frothy, egg-white head over a clear and warm old gold coloured beer with pale orangey hue and very fierce sparkling. Aroma immediately betrays the extra dosis of coriander (as in dry coriander seed), aligned with hints of ginger, bakers yeast, sweet potato, dried banana, gin, radish, nutmeg, pineapple, turnip, mustard seed, pear, unripe plum and some iron. Cleanish fruity onset, crisp with sweetish hints of peach, banana and pineapple along with sourish gooseberry, fizzy carbo but not really overcarbonated for this style, smooth and somewhat creamy mouthfeel, nice caramelly and honeyish malt sweetness with a drier grainy edge, lots of soapy coriander in the finish as expected, some bready yeastiness in the end as well as a spicy hop bitter touch and a glow of warming, gin-like alcohol. Nice spicy tripel, fairly clean and well-balanced. I dont usually like this much coriander, but I have to admit that if you are going to apply it to a tripel anyway in reinforcing an old Belgian cliché, this is a perfectly acceptable way to do it. Technically at a relatively high standard too, like most of Nests beers.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
