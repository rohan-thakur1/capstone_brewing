2940,"2017-01-31",4.2,"2016 edition. 7.1% abv. Bottle from Tipsy in Brooklyn.

Stemless wine glass. Opaque honey body. Big champagne-y foam-y sizzle & crash. 

Smells of skin, soil, mushy apples & a little funk.

Softly sweet upfront, mild, juicy, browned & faintly tart. Minerally, with lots of drying skin. Faint funk, but it airs out after a bit.

Tiny, soft, microbreaded carbonation. Slightly thick. Lacking some acid, but as a whole, wonderfully made.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
2940,"2016-10-23",4.0,"Bottle. Pours clear pale yellow, hints of a light cloud. Beautiful and round throughout, with a light but crisp carbonation, a fruity sweetness that harmonizes well and a semi-dry lightness that is refreshing without losing tastes or flavours. Highly recommended!","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","anstei"

Comment: Merci Patrick. Bouteille 2014.

2940,"2016-06-30",3.5,"Sweet cider nose, maybe delicate spiciness. Juicy start, then dryish towards the end, bit dusty. Well balanced cider, good for breakfast.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2940,"2016-06-30",4.0,"Bottle - Nice fleshy Apple and musty skin. Clearish gold with a decent white head. Funky, light sulphur and peel. Dry and funky, very good.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2940,"2016-06-30",4.1,"750mL bottle, pours a hazy pale golden with a small white head. Aroma is very effervescent, with lots of champagne, light white wine and lightly sweet crisp apple skins. Flavour is complex, with loads of champagne, medium sweetness and white wine. Finishes with some funk and light sweetness. High carbonation, but it works beautifully. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2940,"2016-06-18",3.7,"Vulcain Transparente 2014. Cidre qui présente une tête blanche. Un nez de pommes diverses avec des nuances campagnardes qui ne sont pas très présentes en bouche. En fait, le sucre naturel des pommes est bien évident. Effervescence naturelle. Finale plutôt douce que demi-sèche. Facile à boire. Un cidre qui fait un travail très honnête. Bon sans être exceptionnel.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2940,"2016-05-27",3.8,"pours cloudy very light but almost glowing golden with a rather large white head offering some retention and lacing. lightly tart apples, pears and small yellow fruits; soft underlying bretts - touch of smoke unfortunately; wood with distressed tannins; hint of sweetness - candied ginger and medium toasted spicy honey; lots of chalk, other minerals. bright to moderate carbonation, light body; semi-dry or semi-sweet - depending on how you feel - woodsy-spicy finish. felt a tad too sugary for what i wanted at the moment, but eh! definitely a farmhouse character. very nice swiss rustic cider.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2940,"2016-05-21",3.8,"Bottle shared. Clear gold pour with rather tenacious creamy white head. Aroma is juicy, fruity apples, mild barnyard notes, very faint actually, light citrusy notes. Taste is quite sweet, juicy apple flavor, light fruity acidity. Palate is light bodied, fluffy, semi-sweet. Very easy drinking and approachable cider.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2940,"2016-05-14",4.1,"Bottle (750 ml) shared at tasting. Clear golden with a medium white head leaving little lacing. Aroma is bright and fresh with juicy apples, hints of tropical fruits, mild herbal notes and oak spiciness. Taste is a well dosed mix of apples sweetness, moderate herbal astringency, mild acidity as well as a tiny bit of oak spiciness and vanilla. Light to medium body, but never watery. Lively carbonation that tickles the tongue a bit. Nice and bright apples finish. Moderately dry. Great balance and drinkability. I really like the juiciness and the rustic character. Lovely refined cider.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2940,"2016-05-07",4.0,"Pours a clear golden with a long lasting foamy white head that even leaves some lacing! Nose is of apples (flesh) of course but also light sulfur and farmy aromas. Not as intense as some of the French stuff (Dupont, Cannon and others Im sure), though, so Im sure I could serve that one to ""normal"" people. Light brett leather. Taste is gently tart and lightly sweet. Cider-centric and not really wild. Drying tannic finish. Body is medium and carbonation moderately high and fitting. A solid sparkling farmhouse cider!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
