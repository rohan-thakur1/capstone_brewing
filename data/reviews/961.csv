961,"2017-05-13",4.1,"I liked this beer and its really interesting. The spicy/sourness of the Grand Cru tradition compliment the hops in a very interesting and bold way. I think I prefer the oak aged sour in other iterations more and it is likely costing my rating of the beer. That being said for a hoppier pale ale, the sourness and spice of the beer go along to really make this a nice sipper. Jolly Pumpkin continues to be one of my favorite breweries.","Holland, Michigan, USA","Hopper8"

Flavor has a light sweetness with a bit of honey and some light cracker malt notes. Medium light acidity with some moderate citrus and tropical fruit. Faint stone fruit notes. Some medium light phenolics with coriander and grains of paradise. Light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and super soft and silky with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, the age has added some maltiness, but its still a bright, fruity beer. Perhaps a but muted due to age. Mouthfeel is pretty amazing though; super soft and creamy.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Another lovely tart wild from JP. Im assuming the Grains of Paradise are responsible for the almost peppercorn-like spiciness on both the nose and the tongue.

Light, fruity, lightly sour, and just a touch of funk on the back end. The mouth feel is well done, light, but carbonated and coating. The aftertaste is dry. a citrusy, fruity sourness.

961,"2014-09-07",3.7,"Transfer from BA review on 4-16-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a slightly hazed golden amber color with a huge thick billowy white head that persist very well. The head fades very slowly leaving a fair level of lace on the sides of the glass. 

 Smell  The aroma is massively sweet of almost a candy variety. A big candy like sweetness mixed with a citrus fruit of orange are the heaviest. These are mixed with some yeasty and light spice aromas as well as a somewhat funky sour aroma.

 Taste  The taste begins much more bitter and much less sweet then the nose would have let on. There is an orange citrus and somewhat wheaty flavor beginning the taste. As the taste advances some, it takes on some more sour notes of a sour apple and tart melon like taste. These flavors advance to the end where when the beer is cold the taste ends with a nice light bitter hop flavor which leaves a lightly sour and funky but enjoyable balanced flavor to linger on the tongue. Once the beer warms however, the sour and funky flavors dominate the end, with no real presence of the hop, leaving a somewhat unbalanced flavor to linger in the mouth.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of creaminess and thickness with a carbonation level that is a bit on the higher side. Both are rather nice for the funky and sour tastes of the brew, helping to keep it still rather drinkable in light of its funky sourness.

 Overall  This was a rather interesting brew, although not one I would likely go back to again. As the brew warmed over time it seemed to lose much of the hop flavor that was present at the end of the taste, replacing it with a more puckering sour taste. A decent one to try and best to drink cold.","","Darkmagus82"

A - Pours murky amber orange with a thick two finger tall white head leaving thick rings of lace down the glass.


S - Smells of bright citric fruit, lots of barn yard funk, the typical JP brett, and just a tiny bit of acidic sourness.


T - Starts off with a big dose of dry barnyard funk from the brett slowly giving way to a mix of lemon, even more bready yeast, and a faint kiss of caramel sweetness. The finish is even more chewy brett, leaving the pallet dry for some time.


M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Lots of tart funk in the feel, lingering through the finish.


O - I had quite a few of these over the two days and it really began to grow on me. It had just enough funk without being too overpowering.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

961,"2013-08-15",3.5,"Blend #2, bottled in April 29, 2010.
Appearance: The body is a hazy amber with a towering light tan head that dissipates very slowly. The head dissipates very unevenly, creating a maze through to the liquid.
Aroma: The aroma is tart and funky with some leather, lemons and bright cherries. Very enticing!
Taste: Slightly tart with cherries up front into musky malts with an overlying tart lemon. The finish is mild and refreshing, semi-tart lemon and hints of malts. This drinks nice for a 3 year old beer.
Palate: A bit watery with mild carbonation. The bottle is slowly gushing, pushing up a snake of carbonation, so Im guessing the carbonation is leaving the beer and not present in the body despite a huge head.
Overall: I wasnt expecting much, but this is decent. I like the bright lemon and cherry flavors but the malts have become musky and distract from the flavor. The beer is also overcarbed, but at the same time its lost the carbonation in the body. I would like to try this fresh as its likely great.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

961,"2013-06-20",3.8,"750ml served in a snifter

A - Ruby grapefruit orange with a thick white head with good specks but overall average at best.

S - Smells like an an acid trip of dank wet basement, bright but old lemons, 60 year old man slacks(pressed) pineapple sprinkled with dust, woody orange, briny shellfish. Sounds weird until you read this while smelling it and go WOW!

T - Sour pineapple, cider apples, over ripened grapefruit, dry herbal character, basement funk creeps over but is subtle, a very pale malt resides under a wet church pew funk. The finish is very dry and dusty with the yeast standing out.

M - Light to medium feel, creamy carbonation, very wet but dry at the finish.

This is an excellent beer to pour and just explore the different flavors, textures, and strange characteristics of what wild yeast can do to a beer. Good citrus and tropical flavors a slightly tart and sweet character while the basement funk is subtle and bold at the same time. Good stuff here. Reminds me of an Orval redux.

Luciernaga pours a light caramel color with golden edges.  A substantial off-white froth forms on the initial pour, leaving a nice sheet of lace down the side of the glass.  

There is a generous spicy oak presence in the nose.  The woody notes accentuate the light wild yeast funkiness.  A zesty lemon presence is noticeable with a bit of coriander as well.  A bit musty as well.

The flavor starts out slightly tart, with a light-bodied grassy malt presence.  Lemon zest, hay, and a bit of spice are all surrounded by a woody oak presence.  The flavor is tart but not overly sour.  The progression of flavors is very typical of a Jolly Pumpkin offering.

With a smooth, lightly creamy feel and a light to medium body, the mouthfeel works well with the flavors of the beer.

4.5 A: Hazy orange brown color. Three fingers of pillowy white head with excellent retention and plenty of lacing.

4.0 S: Brett comes off as the strongest aroma. Lots of different spices going with pepper, corriander, grains of paradise and even cinnamon, but none of them are very strong. Pretty decent, I like what the brett is doing here.

3.5 T: Surprisingly drying on finish is what I noticed first. Grains of paradise show up big time with corriander and pepper on the second front. Very pear like fruitiness. Brett funk blends in with the other flavors as opposed to being the focus. Good, but lacking something I cant quite put my finger on. I wish I could give this a 3.75 for taste.

4.5 M: Medium body. Good actively spritzy carbonation. Good creaminess as well. One of the highlights of this beer.

3.5 D: Its an okay beer, but certainly not worth the price. Flavors seem okay on paper, but its missing some of the intangibles that make a beer great. Im not a huge fan of pear flavor in beer and this one has a lot of it.

Good level of funk, but hasnt quite hit the level of complexity I like and am used to from Jolly Pumpkin beers. Taste really reflects this, as its somewhat one dimensional, although still tasty. Just doesnt stand up to pillars like Orval and Westy Blonde. Mouthfeel is a nice touch--light with good carbonation. Drinkability is a bit lower as its not quite as sessionable (at least as far as blondes generally are compared to their bigger Belgian brothers) as others of the style.

961,"2010-09-21",3.7,"750mL. Pours a cloudy light orange with a simply gigantic head that blooms out of the tulip and looks like a coke float. Retention is endless. Lacing is all encompassing. Carbonation is insanely vigorous- it looks like someone dropped dry ice into the glass. The head is blocking the aroma from taking hold- though when it subsides after 10 minutes or so there is pronounced oak, nutmeg, sweat, barnyard, more sweat. The taste is simple, the oak drying out what is citrus peel forward with a good deal of saltwater and funk. Palate is very soft despite the powerful carbonation. Very refreshing.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

961,"2010-08-29",4.1,"Orange and hazy under a voluminous head which fades much like a spluttering volcano. Thankfully, there is no lava involved, just a bounteous nose which demands my full attention. Tartness nibbles the front and tickles the back as all Jolly Pumpkin beers do, and I love every minute of it. Sour lemons and limes delight while grapefruit and tangerines accompany toasted bread. Dewdrops glimmer atop flower petals, and I immediately think of candied flower petals decorated with a light dusting of powdered sugar. Throw a bit more lemon zest in there and voila, lemon drops for those who love to pucker. Dried straw is a subtle accent in the background along with faint green grass esters. Lovely. Being bottle-conditioned, I rightfully expect and receive a soft frothy mouthfeel which lifts her body and cleanses my palate for each flavorful quaff. Her sour side is more bark than bite, allowing gentle flower petals, grassy esters, and dry straw to appropriately dazzle. Oranges and apricots lay naked on a plate before me, their discarded skins bittering the finish. Lemon and lime zest mingles with tart apricot skins in the middle while her Bretty side slowly dries my palate. Shadows of dry hop cones, dry straw, and dry flower petals whisper in my lingering breath. Sweet up front, she leads me into lemon-lime zest with floral and Bretty esters coming last. Complex yet simple, sessionable yet contemplative, Luciernaga maintains her effervescence through the last quaff.


Its been a few months since I tasted the Luciernaga Firefly from Jolly Pumpkin, but like the good little beer geek that I am, there is a bottle set aside at home in a relatively dark and definitely cool place. Maybe sometime Ill crack her open on a gorgeous sunny day with blue skies and nary a cloud in sight. Sounds fantastic to me.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Aroma of green apple, hazelnuts, musty hops, soft hay, and some very subtle malty hints. Tastes like a fresh granny smith apple with some malt softness in the finish. Mouthfeel is tender and silky with some tart and a bit of pucker. This beer is truly something special and incredibly enjoyable. Excellent all around.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"

Slightly citric and dusty with a minerally presence and a rustic layer of leather covering up some citric/grassy hop notes. The flavor isnt as complex as the outstanding aroma. Has some spicy/tannic apple skins as well. A great dry Belgian Ale.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

961,"2009-09-01",4.5,"I have enjoyed every Jolly Pumpkin beer I have tasted and this was no exception. In fact, this was probably my favorite after Biere De Mars. The color was a cloudy orange, hazy. The head was viciously strong and took a while to settle. it looked like whipped fluff sitting on top of the brew. The smell was funk! Funky, funky, with some sour vinegar and mustiness but I liked it! The taste was also sour, fruity, dry, delicious. The Jolly Pumpkin beers are kinda costly but they really are well made beers. Excellent!

961,"2009-08-28",3.9,"Batch 296/297.  Typical JP gusher.  Pours a murky-coppery-gold color with a massive (and growing), off-white, fluffy, rocky head which takes some time to settle but does eventually leave a mostly lasting, small, pillowy layer and sporadic, Belgian lace all over.  Nose is pleasant and unique; sourish notes of lemons and orange peel, wet earth, some funky basement yeast, overripe pineapple, sweet caramel, a bit of allspice, light buttery biscuits, and hints at horse blanket.  Flavor starts out with a sour lemon flash but then mellows bringing some wet earth, pineapple, light dry caramel, orange peel, light white pepper, funky/basement yeast, and a moderately light hop bitterness into the finish.  Palate is medium, light on the tongue yet coating, drying a touch, and lively.  The long, lightly dry finish has the spice notes disappearing and leaving some light horse blanket, basement yeast, earthy/bitter hops, and an underlying lemon sourness lingering to the end.  Another really good beer from JP, nothing exceptional but very well put together with the typical tartness/sourness you get in almost all of their beers.  Incredibly drinkable and refreshing with a perfect balance of spice, sour notes, sweetness, hops, and funky yeast notes.  My only complaint is that the sour flash initially is a bit strong but soon mellows to a showcase the other supporting notes.  I have never had anything from this brewery that was not good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

961,"2009-08-07",3.5,"750ml bottle.
Opening and pouring this stuff was an absolute mess. Foam gushed everywhere the second the cap came off. Trying to get more than a couple ounces worth into a glass was a chore. I like a good foam on top of my beer, but this is beyond overkill. When it finally did settle into liquid form, it had a nice cloudy pale amber hue. Aroma is spicy, yeasty, earthy, grassy hops and grains. Flavor follows suit, as if one were drinking a liquid meadow minus the dirt and rocks. Hops are moderately bitter, while malt sweetness plays a background role only, just there to keep things under control. Full and creamy palate once the carbonation settles down. IMO this is one of Jolly Pumpkins weaker efforts, but its still pretty good.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

The flavour is light sweet, light bitter and light to medium acidic. Good balance between the brett, malt, spices, wood and noble hops. Tones of lemon, pears, apples, coriander, white pepper, barnyard, basement and dryish oak. The mouthfeel is a bit tart yet soft with a medium, light champagne-like carbonation.

961,"2009-07-08",3.8,"750ml bottle - $8.49 at Beverage SuperStore in Suwanee, Georgia. No listed batch number.

Appearance: Pours out a clearish, dark orange body with a huge, dense, foamy, white head.

Smell: Malts enveloped with acrid notes of musty wild yeasts, butyric acid, juiced apples, mangled pineapples, damp oak wood, earthy spices.

Taste: Toasted, honeyish malts instantly disappear behind the strongly phenolic Brett character. Pristine pineapple juice blended with spoiled apple juice. The doses of Grains of Paradise and coriander are quite spicy and particularly pungent, giving the tongue a bit of enduring ginger-like heat. Touch of oak. Surprisingly bitter as well. Particularly dry finish with a lingering taste of the added spices.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-high carbonation.

Drinkability: As always, its another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin. The spices can be a bit overly brash at times. While not the most captivating of the Jolly Pumpkin lineup, its certainly solid and worth a try.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

A very round flavor, the oak, brett, maltines and spices really meld nicely while still being tantalizingly delicious, just fairly sour and sweet, touch creamy.  Nice long brett and oak aftertaste with just a touch of tart sourness.

961,"2009-05-28",2.7,"750ml bottle poured into a Trappist glass.  Ive wanted to try this beer for years.  I bought quite a few JP beers all together and saved this one for last.  To be honest, based on the other samples, I dont like their product as a whole.  Here goes with the final one...  Luciernaga pours orange-colored with a large fluffy head that lingers nicely.  The aroma has the vinegar cast that Ive come to associate with the brewery.  Theres also mild hops, coriander and faint bubble gum.  Like nearly all of their other beers this one is quite tart but not offensively so.  The tartness does drown out the flavors but the coriander shows through.  Im not impressed.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MrRain"

JP beers Ive had of late that are just pure funk. Flavor has an unusually nice interplay between funky notes and bitter, hoppy notes as well as lightly bready malt.

961,"2009-05-24",4.0,"750 ml bottle from Binnys (Orland Park, IL). Im excited to try this! Pours a very hazy fiery amber, orange and gold with amber, big billowy almost tannish white head. Laces very well. Very aromatic, pushing some heavy fruit esters: banana, pear, and some apple with good spicing, clove and grains of paradise, belgian yeast spice, vanilla and very light cinnamon. A bit of a wet grass, funk, but fruit kinda dominates. Initial is completely different: some bretty sourness and tartness come forward, light funk moving into a bit of barnyard and cheesiness. Light bodied, delicate without flavors necessarily dominating the beer over others. Strikes a nice balance, with the fruit taking in the backend of the palate with pear, apple, and light banana. Sticks to the palate, the funk and light tartness win me over as I sip this, relaxing the holiday weekend away. The spice is there, but gives way to fruit and funks delicate, flavorful, special balance. Cheers to this!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Ok now Im not sure if I had gotten a semi-infected bottle but i read about 6 pages of reviews and no mention of bad bottles anywhere. Initial pour was a crisp clear burnt orange-amber with lots of rising carbonatin and a super huge foamy white head. End of the bottle was a very hazy burnt orange-amber with an average size creamy white head. Now the aroma is what made me think this one might have been on the off side because that classic sour lemon, wet wood, funky aroma was the only scents coming through. Palate was my next clue with a thin body and super strong carbonation that seemed to foam up even more upon hitting your mouth. My third and final clue was the only flavor that was detectable was some sour ass funk.

The beer itself is an eclipsed orange and brown with a blizzard of bubbles.  While the head never really dissolves, it slowly breaks down into a fascinating block of bubbly ruins and castle turrets.  The aroma is rich and soft, though the aromas themselves are from sharper things - tobacco, leather, fried food, scotch, butter, dandelions, pepper, Jalapenos and a little lemon.  Rich, but very desert and Southern hemisphere, without the creams and sweets I typically enioy.  The taste features these same kind of ""musty"" flavors"", like shoe leather, tobacco, peppers and scotch again, and the acquired taste of olive.  I like it, but it’s odd.

It is very inviting.  The flavor is malty and fruity (hint of bubblegum too) at first and then the spiciness (nutmeg and corriander) and some dryness hits in the mid-palate along with a touch of tartness.

Nose is one-dimensional but inviting aroma of yeast and sour citrus, mainly a tangerine-orange montage.  More funky tangerine, lemon pith, a smidgen of pear, and a little spice.  Finishes dry and spicy with a lingering orangey aftertaste. Hops are  semi noticeable but the fruity palate takes the forefront.  Very tart and effervescent.

961,"2008-04-08",3.7,"another gusher, but not as aggressively as others ive had from jp.  huge, dense, rocky off-white head that sticks around forever.  seriously.  its meringue instead of beer foam.  it went down about an inch every five minutes.  it took a while before i even noticed the deep and hazy honey-gold beer sitting beneath it.  the smell is sort of classic jolly pumpkin:  lots of funk stand out first, then it fades into an earthy, grassy note, with lemon zest in the background.  some vanilla and spice mingle with the honey malt to form a decent malt note.  taste is lighter on the funk, with a lot more spice, a lot more earthy and grassy hops, and a lot less citrus.  pretty bitter on the finish, seemingly the combined result of the hops and the spicy astringency.  quite dry, as expected, with a lot of carbonation for an incredibly creamy mouthfeel.  not as slaking as id hoped.  id drink it again, but the maracaibo especial still tops this, for my tastes.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

Ill rate that taste.","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
961,"2008-03-30",3.7,"Very heady beer regardless of how gently I poured it. This is a thick and cloudy deep-gold beer that smells spicey and vaguely fruity. Very full in the mouth, a bit high on the carbonation level for my taste. The flavors in the beer hit my tongue in various stages, the spice hit me first followed shortly after by the bitterness of the hops. The grain and spice dominate the mouth primarily and the taste is all around well balanced, leaving a satisfying cacophony of flavor in your mouth for a bit after.

Good Brett character, but not too much else.  Sourness level is nice, but a bit thin.  Id much prefer Oro de Calabaza, or even La Roja to this.

App.:  Cloudy medium-amber, decent off white foam with generous lacing.

Palate:  Medium body and moderate effervescence with a touch of astringency.
  
Flav.:  Lots of organic acids, coriander, white pepper, those green bitter herbs, some barnyard funk a hint of softer, sweet flavours, some light fruitiness (mainly pome fruits and a touch of dark dried fruits); quite tart and very bitter.

961,"2008-03-16",4.1,"Pours a gorgeous, hazy, glowing medium gold.  A huge, foamy, off-white head is incredibly well retained, leaving diverse, organic splotches of lacing behind.  The aroma shows dry, funky Belgian yeast throughout.  Notes of pale golden malts, orange peel, lemon peel, fresh flowers, and dry, herbal hops work together in perfect harmony.  In addition to the aforementioned elements, the flavor features a moderate use of coriander, a component that is prone to overuse is many a pale Belgian.  The spicy, floral hop character is perfect here, working wonderfully with the dryness that the Brett imparts.  Medium bodied, with a bone dry palate, this is exactly what I look for in a session brew.  This would pair wonderfully with a myriad of culinary treats.  Awesome brew.

The flavor is fruity, some lemon, tart, salt, wild honey sweetness wrapped in a funky shell laced with vanilla, some hops - lots of trippy symphonic complexity.

961,"2008-01-18",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2008 The smell is something I just cant put a finger on. Is it cranberries, as Joris pointed out in his review? Or is it something else? Whatever the hell it is, its great. Even my girlfriend kept smelling it, and she doesnt drink beer. Super acidic brett in the nose, with backing fruity sweet malts. The taste is less in your face brett as the aroma, and more of a balanced, Orval kinda thing. And I like it. Sweet caramel and almost-plum malts sit beneath spicy, citrusy, floral hops, with a beautiful, barely acidic green apple finish. Now for my 2 complaints. 1 - Its a gusher. Beware. Half my bottle blew up all over the kitchen. And it just kept going, I had to get 3 glasses. 2 - The mouthfeel. Weak and flat. Cmon! To have such a beautiful beer be almost ruined by being too thin is a damn shame. Regardless, I love this brewery and all their products. Best Belgian themed brewery in America. This is not their best brew, but nothing they do is bad. EDIT: Ok, after I added some of the dregs from the bottom of the bottle, the brett character in the flavor, as well as the mouthfeel, both greatly improved. What a phenomenal beer, once its all said and done.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","santos999"
961,"2008-01-18",3.0,"I think what did it in for me has the odd flavor created by the type of yeast used in the brewing process. Jolly Pumpkin grows the yeast strain within the barrel (some are quite old) and to me it results in a sour, almost bad cheese taste.

The beer poured into the glass and then kept coming out the top of the bottle, even when half was consumed. The beer was lightly hazy golden and with that super duper head that was second to none. The flavors that came forth as one sucks the head were pure oak. Following that was a nice fruity nature and a strong bittering character. The flavor was earthy and spicy and uniquely interesting. The flavor had a presence of brett coupled to wood and had some citrus, some light caramel and a wheat characteristic. The finish was dry with lasting strong bittering and oak long into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was medium, or maybe more, but the HUGE carbonation was almost too much for enjoyment.

The finish itself is rather dry, and some pleasant light fruit and wood tones stick into the aftertaste. This is some pretty tasty stuff.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

Some earthy farmyard in the flavour with the anticipated sharp bretty notes. But its more fruity and less uncompromisingly sour than I expected. The sourness is more of a moderate bite than a full on blast. All of which makes it an interesting but surprisingly easy drinking beer. Cant deny I was expecting something a little more extreme though.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Finishes long, floral and spicy.  Very Orval like, lots of green apples and brett.  The bottle exploded when I opened it, its a good this I decided not to open it next to my computer.

961,"2007-08-16",4.4,"In the 750 mL bottle from Beertopia. Another homerun from Dexter. This pours a hazy golden brown with a custard-like thick head. It is one of the most beautiful beers that I have ever seen. This beer is like chewing on a pine tree. I simply love the generous use of hops in this. The strong oak flavor is still present, but the hop bitterness takes over the dominant role from the oak barrel in this one. Has that horse barn aroma and is slightly sulfurous. Strong orange and coriander to the nose as well. Drinking this is a delightful experience: the first sip seemed strong and harsh with all that in-your-face bitterness. However, after the third sip, the beer seems super smooth and blended. Sweetness begins to exude out of this thing like crazy. After a few more sips, this gets positively oakey out the wazoo. I get lots and lots of pineapple and grapefruit flavors at the warming finish. After trying this, I am convinced that so many belgian styles that I find hard to enjoy would greatly benefit from a generous use of hops.

Luciernaga poured a hazed over orange into my tulip glass. There are many tiny carbonation bubbles rising from everywhere. A 3 finger white microbubbled head appeared on the pour that faded to a 2 finger rockiness. Leaves chunk lacing after each drink.

Smell is dominated by spices but they are in no way overwhelming. Im picking up clove and cardamom that are really nicely balanced. There is that summer field weediness and barn muskiness that are common in saisons. Very refreshing.

Theres is much more malt in the flavor and the spices are more subdued. Nice malty sweetness with a twang on the finish. Its all together spicy and herbal. Very nice. Saison like with a slight sourness and a little more malt backbone.

Mouthfeel is light and lively. Dancing on the tongue. Finishes crisp and dry.

Drinkability is very good. The spices are in no way overpowering. Dry and leaving me wanting more. The lower 6.5% ABV will let you enjoy more than one glass easily.

The Firefly is an extremely goodbeer from Jolly Pumpkin. Definately worth a try if you see it. A nice little twist on a good saison.

The flavor is very complex but also has a lot of harmony, every elements seem to blend with the others, the wood,  the peppery yeast, fruits, brett and spices unite to make me feel happy and then some, I notice in the end a sour and dry feeling. After a superb aroma and flavor, what about the palate ? It has a nice medium thickness with a vinous texture and gentle carbonation.

Medium bodied, smooth, creamy, and satisfying mouthfeel.

Slight chocolate, cheese, lemon-lime soda. Very nice. Great pour, dark yellow/brown with a fluffy, lacing head. Delicious flavor, as well, more subtle, fruity, refined. Lots of tropical fruit type flavors (kiwi, starfruit, mango, pomegranite, perhaps), subtle oak as before, good spices. Kind of like an oaky saison. Light grassy hops present.

Its hoppier than most Belgian ales though still fairly mild.  The spices come through well and theres a hint of oak.  At first it seemed a touch watery to me, but as it warmed that went away.

961,"2006-11-13",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2008 In short: A soft but complex brett and barrel marriage.
How: Botle 750ml, various vintages, various aging.
The look: cloudy dark golden body with a medium off-white head
In long: Super marriage of Brettanomyces and barrel.  Extra-comfortable cushiony body.  Some dried fruits, a few orange peels, a little woody caramel and a pinch of white pepper.  Overall barnyard sensation.  But its really the Brett and barrel that makes this beer.  Despite being very bretty the Luciernaga doesnt come with any of the sourness of other brett bombs (Bam Biere, Sanctification, etc.).  Think Orval without the hops.  This is a soft beer but what it lacks in intensity it more than makes up with complexity and originality.

961,"2006-09-06",4.1,"Grand and immutable, the eggshell white froth rests above a pool of bronze liquid.  Though mild in amplitude, the aroma sweeps across a broad radius of intoxicating fragrances.  Immediately forthcoming are sappy, grassy humulene offerings and piquant fruit elements resembling pineapples and peaches.  Warm sourdough notes envelop sharp coriander and nutmeg, greeting bright lychees.  Opening with an airy fruit sweetness countered by a prickly acidity, the flavor slowly transforms into a long finish replete with soft hops and rounded spices.  All elements of the aroma and flavor are ever so delicately balanced, yet they all manage to have great presence and impact.  Lithe and silky, the texture marries splendidly with the brushing carbonation.

961,"2006-09-03",4.3,"The beer came in a 750 ml. bomber with a very artfully done label. The Belgian style pale ale came out cloudy, deep golden, and bubbly, and readily formed a rocky two finger head, that kept rising up until it was sticking above the glass in a volcano shaped cone of bubbles. Havent seen a display such active carbonation since the last time I cracked open a Duvel. The nose was classic Jolly Pumpkin sour, with a clear note of Brettanomyces, which undoubtedly was lurking in the crevices of the barrels this beer was aged in. The taste was dry, oak-influenced, and earthy, with the Brettanomyces showing up rarely as band-aid. The spices were quite muted, and hard to pick out above all the other flavor influences. The band-aid off flavor and the Brett character faded as I let the beer breathe, and Luciérnaga became sweeter and mellower. Pleasingly medium in body, this was also quite warming for a 6.5% ABV pale ale, which was probably due to the fact that I was gulping this easy to drink beer down fast. In my opinion, this was one of the best uses of barrel aging I have run across for a while, and quite fitting the term Artisan Ale that is proudly a part of the name of this brewery.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
961,"2006-08-30",4.9,"Decade topper.  The beer - a living organism - spurts forth its excitement upon opening, issuing a sampler of its sure to be generous head.  Indeed, the head amply more than matches the volume of beer poured, looking regally staisfied in the well-proportioned tulip glass.  An aroma unlike one I recall encountering before, green apple hoppiness, with a squeeze of palpably sour citrus.  A touch of sweetness from the green apple bracing the sourness.  Exquisite.  The head becomes chunky as is slowly fades, leaving jubilant, patterned lacing behind.  The warm up to this beer is a phenomenon in itself, justifying what must by now be many hours of patience with much lesser brews.  It may be the only, or one of the only, perfect scores I have given to aroma to date.  The beer is no letdown in the flavor - one you could suck down like a dionysiac if you were inclined to decadent debauchery, or slowly savor were you inclined to maximize your hedonic and perceptual experience.  The collisions of hops and sourness from the yeast generate a refined fruit flavor that is quite enjoyable to the seasoned palate.  This is not the easiest to get in these parts but with any luck I will drink it every year to commemorate my life.  (Its a good adult substitute for friendlys mint ice cream pie, with the green label & flavor.)  Simply a wonderful idea, flawlessly executed.  Now, they simply need to age this in some kind of cherry sugar soaked cask and I will give it a 5.

Smells like Noble hops to me, but not sure which ones.  Appearance:  Dark amber/orange in color and very hazy.  Bottle popped when opened, and a small trickle of foam came forth.  Even with a careful pour this thing had a monster head in the tulip shaped glass.  Head was off-white and very, very fluffy looking.  Almost like someone poured a cloud into the top of my beer.  Fantastic lacing.  Flavor:  Some nice fruity flavors up front, mostly apples, pears, and a touch of green grapes.  Brett sourness soon interjects itself smoothly.  Sourness was just enough and tasted almost of limes. A little of that musty funk is carried in with the sourness. The spiciness comes through as well.  Im getting a bit of coriander and a touch of pepper.  Some oak and slightly piney hop flavors are carried into the finish by the sourness.  Palate:  Medium bodied with a slightly creamy texture.  Lively carbonation bordering on aggressive.  Finish was slightly bitter, but pretty clean overall.  Overall:  I really enjoyed this one.  So many flavors pulled together and balanced masterfully.

My one and only complaint about this beer is that my patience was starting to wear thin while waiting for the gushing head to subside.  Regardless, a delicious brew overall.  Thanks, Tom!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
961,"2006-06-11",4.3,"Bottle.  This was a gusher like no other.  Its really a good thing JP doesnt cage and cork their bottles, because this would have broken a lightbulb.  Anyway, this is a fascinating beer.  When cold, theres a very discernable hop presence, especially for a Belgian style.  Very musty and earthy in the nose, like a good farmhouse.  But, theres a nice sweet, yet hoppy underpinning to the farmhouse.  Very nice nose.  Very complex in the mouth.  Tart and lemony to begin, like a world class lemonade.  Very thirst quenching and lip puckering.  Every sip leaves you craving the next.  The lemony citrus leads to a sweet backbone consisting of honey and a hint of banana.  Dry, tart and hoppy finish.  It almost defies classification, as its like a perfect melding of a saison and an APA, and its very Orval-like in its presentation.  Excellent beer, and now Im off to find a Grand Reserve ...","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

Smells like a hot forest, woody and floral that sweats. Rich velvety mouth feel, caramel sourness that tastes good, TAR said band-aids, but I dont see it. I get salty, light lime sherbet, lingering sour finish. A touch of butter cream. The spices are working well here. A good beer with good company and good music as the day dies down on the back patio makes for a good time.

Aroma is fruity and dusty with some cellar funkiness.  A nice dry yeastiness with a touch of brett ties it all together nicely.  Very dry and funky up front with just the lightest fruitiness on the finish.  Notes of coriander, herbs, and a light hoppiness.  The brett character really came out as it warmed toward room temperature.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with lively fine carbonation.  Very refreshing.  Just a beautiful beer.

Taste is almost perfect with a great mix between floral malt, oak and a well balance presence of sourness and tart. The spices that are mentioned on the label (Coriander and grain of paradise) are very subtle and could hardly be tasted though. This is probably the closest thing to Orval that Ive had the chance to drink.

961,"2006-03-08",3.5,"750ml bottle thanks to Styles: Pours with a huge white head that is quite well-retained and leaves thick lacing around the outside of the glass.  The body shines a bright pale-medium amber that is almost totally clear if gently poured.  Tiny bubbles can be seen shooting to the surface.  The nose shows a bit of lightly sour funk, barnyard, and what smells like a barrel that held lambic for a short time.  Theres a touch of mint, a hint of earthy pepper when swirled, and a touch of wet grain.  This smells almost like a 50/50 combination of gentle gueuze and belgian wit.  The taste begins lightly sour with some lemon lest, then opens into oak barrel, hints of vanilla, pepper, mild tannins, a bit of dry wheat & sweet light malt, then the spicy hops come through in the middle and finish.  As it warms it actually becomes quite spicy all the way through from the peppery notes in the beginning to the hops towards the end (though the bitterness from the hops is felt from the beginning).  Medium body, medium-lively carbonation, finishes bitter and dry.

961,"2006-01-21",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2009 Aroma is funky and spicy with a soft sweaty (not musty) tinge..like a womans sweat not sharp, greasy man sweat. Pour was the most Belgian-like I have ever seen from an American made Belgian style. The look of Belgian ales when being poured have always had an appeal to me so that alone earn points. Pale amber color with a frothed up, two finger thick, creamy, lasting white head. Fore is very herbal and spicy with lots of mashed vegetable/herb notes. Almost has a stewed zucchini flavor to it. There are some sweeter soft fruits beneath, but the spices and herbal notes dominate. Lot of funky, overripe flavors in the finish. There is so much going on here and yet it still stays soft and fun to drink. A very interesting beer.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

To me, this is pretty much everything I like in a saison; so much so that as FBR and I sat and sipped, words and descriptions pretty much escaped us.  Aroma was farmlands planted with mellow summer fruits, horses trotting thru spice fields (grapes, melons, corriander, hops, floral, etc.).  Poured a bright and glowing amber/red with perfec head and lacing.  Great balance of malt and thin spicy hop, mellow warmth at the finish.

I didnt know that and i also detected this in there as well.  Palate is somewhat fizzy but well balanced.  Lots of lemon and corrander in there.  pretty good, but not as complex as i would have expected.  La Roja is far better in my book.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

961,"2005-12-26",4.0,"2005 bottle consumed Nov. 05.  Thick, creamy, dense chalk-white head (similar, if not quite as dense and well-retained as Orval) atop a golden-brass colored body, bottle conditioned and with a slight haziness.  Head is well-retained and laces sufficiently.  Aroma is a delightful dose of playful brett, with light notes of honey in the background a touch of pears, limes and apples.  The hops are there in generous proportion as well, with a zesty, spiciness of noble hops (saaz and or hallertauer I guess).  Quite intense and lasting is the aroma, significanly more round and fruity than orval, not as focused on the brett and hops, but they are still there in abundance.  Flavor begins sweet, with juicy pears, nectarines and limey brett.  Touches of oak add complexity, a dry wood feel of sorts adding balance to the maltiness.  Hops are lightly sweaty but quite crisp on the finish, with plenty of brett carrying through.  Mouthfeel shows tiny, compact bubbles adding a tight element to it, while the texture is gentle, yet lightly creamy.  Unfortunately, in my sample, all was going slendidly until after about 15, 20 minutes when the texture became just plain watery but even worse, noticeable raw alcohol notes emerged in both aroma and flavor.Cask pint at Sunset Grille, 12/20/2005Copper-amber toned golden, with a soft, emergent red sheen to it.  Perched atop is a very well-retained white head, hugely foamy and full of large bubbles.  The aroma is again of brett, but this time, it shares the bill much more equally with the sweet orange fruits and light doughy malt.  Flavor is very fruity, decidedly much more than from the bottle, though it is bright and playful, only being brought down to earth by the lightly bready and a touch sourish maltiness.  Hops are soft and earthy, lightly sweaty but not as crisp on the end.  Brett is certainly there, but much more subdued.  Carbonation is quite expansive on this one, and I still get a touch of wateriness towards the end, but there is no alcohol apparency in this sample.  Dosent seem to work as well on cask, warm obviously, which provides the malt with too much fuel and gives it that bready-sweet build up on the palate (coriander too apparent as well) while compromising some of the crispness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
961,"2005-12-25",4.3,"Pours hazy amber with enormous, rocky, off-white head. Big chunky lacing. The aroma is apricot and oranges with a good amount of funk underneath.

961,"2005-12-22",3.8,"Thick, thick, big-bubbled head.  Cloudy orange body.  Very full aroma:  oranges/citrus, limes, apricots and just plain fruity.  The flavor doesnt quite match the aroma, but its pretty good.  Dry, and less sweet than I expected.  Herbal and earthy notes, with hints of the fruits.  The carbonation is a little much for me, so I will lower my rating for this.  Something lingers that reminds me of apples...","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"

Bright white head with good lacing.  Very woody, vanilla, and peppery.  Very course palate due to tones of carbonation.  Dry as dry can be.  I really dont know what to think of this beer.

961,"2005-12-07",4.7,"Semi-translucent and glowing orangish-copper in color with a decadent mossy head and slow motion cascading lace that mimics vellum from time to time.  Aroma delivers with green grape skin and souring pinot grapes, brett funk, and a perfumey hop zest comprised of lilacs and callolilies.  I could sniff this for years.  Other wafts produce coriander and lemon rind scrapings, and some sugary esters underneath it all.  Oak and brett take a flavor likeness to riesling aged in chardonnay casks.  Floral attributions configure a tulip and rose petal bouquet arrangement, perfectly captured within the subtle hop array.  Checked coriander, lime juice and daffodils aid the symbiotic rendition and subconscious slips of melanin.  Palate perfection, ingrained with oaken smoothness and encapsulating effervescence to provide a custom net that catches and catapults the rigid, sour trait display.  Mild finish, as a resilient and persistent spice force sings a duet of coriander and chrysanthemums.  No one in the country is displaying this much artistry and brilliance in the craft of brewing as Ron achieves every single time.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The palate is velvety and medium bodied.  It has a very strong carbonation on the front of the tongue.  It has some dryness to it.  The flavor is  spicy with lots of coriander.  Earthy hops and yeast.  The aroma has a subtle fruity characteristic to it.  Similar to pineapple or pomegranate.  Theres also some nice yeasts and light oak.

I almost thought it was a cask of lambic.  Hazy gold in color that just touches into the orange hue.  Flavor is barnyard mixed with sweetness and spices that sit quite syrupy on the palate.  It was a decent pint but the comm. desc. mentions nothing of Brett. so I must assume it is infected.  When I told the bartender what it tasted like, he poured a glass, smelled it, tasted it, and promptly took it off the beer engine.  I will re-rate if Brett. is supposed to be a part of the flavor and aroma but I would have to doubt it.

961,"2005-04-09",4.3,"Had an Orval earlier, so it maybe unfair to have this after, but we will see how this fairs. Dark cloudy amber color with a moderate, creamy looking beige head. A curtain of lace cover the side of the glass. Has a mild Orval aroma twist to it. Aromas of light malt, pepper, lime and wild flowers. Some hints of menthol as well. I wanted to try this just because of the firefly name - Wauwatosa also means firefly (I like the JP thing as well), many thanks Lou, you know who!).  Lots of flavors bounding about in this one. LIght milk caramel flavors are only a gentle base for this brew. Light cognac, infused with coriander and mild white pepper. If I were single, Id be getting into the car tomorrow to drive to MIchigan and find more of this. Mild plum and light allspice now are knocking on the senses. A finish with mild currant and pale malt last longingly on the tongue. A refined palate, with the liquid lasting long enough on the tongue to be lifted by a small gentle bubbles to carry the quaff the rest of the journey. If I wasnt such a purist, and hadnt just had the Orval, This would have gotten a much higher score. The moment was right for this brew - the wife is out, the kids are in bed, its been a long day, I wanted a good beer. Thanks God and Mike for this one.

My glasses may be rose tinted lately, but this is just another in a string of beautiful beers Ive been lucky enough to sample.  Aromas are deeply layered with even malts, soft and floral hops, mildly peppery and mouldy yeasts, banana, coriander.  Lively, spritzy, soft, and airy body keeps the malts at bay; the beer never gets too sweet.  Unripe pear flavors meld with floral hops.  Grapeskin acidity, a bit tart.  Oh man, this is quite a find!

Coriander milkiness seduces, and is frothy carbonation is lively and authentic, this is as drinkable as it can get, while remaining rustic.

961,"2004-12-29",3.8,"Sampled lightly chilled, December 2004
Pours a hazy light amber to copper color, the haze is entirely a chill haze as this beer was quite clear before I chilled it.  It is topped by a tan head that is quite thick, frothy and creamy at the same time.  As I was pouring it, I thought that I got some aromatic notes of oak, but more the woody component, which I was not really expecting.  As I go in for a more extended sniff, I get a complex mix of wood, orange peel, cobwebs, and a bit of herbal character.  There is a definite dominant note here that I cannot quite place, it is sort of spicy, yet combines all of the above descriptors as well.

My first taste; this beer stats out soft and smooth, and then moves to a certain mouth coating fullness, it then finishes with a slightly sharp astringency, yet throughout it remains refreshing.  The interesting aroma from the nose is in the taste as well, and there is a certain tannic backbone here as well, perhaps the contribution from the barrel fermentation.  This beer is quite interesting, and certainly not at all what I expected.  The taste is subtly spicy with soft, smooth notes of orange, grass/ hay, ginger, and coriander.  Ah that is what it is, the coriander is what I was sensing in the nose.  And I also see that grains of paradise was used too, which also makes sense as I always felt that this contributes a sort of dusty dried ginger type thing to a beer.

As it begins to warm up I start to get and enticing note of green beans that have just been spritzed with lemon  in the nose.  And despite it sounding weird, this beer really does evoke thoughts of chewing on old dusty cobwebs.  I really like the fact that this beer has a certain fullness and body to it, even though it is relatively low in alcohol, it gives this beer a certain richness that is quite appropriate for a December evening.  There is a certain soft creaminess to this beer that I am really digging, it just envelopes my mouth in an extravagant celebration of taste.

Despite all I have said, this is currently lacking that certain... something, that would put this over the top, but given Jolly Pumpkins stated goals and practices, I have a feeling that this will become more complex and challenging (this is definitely a good thing) over time.  And please dont let my statement make you think that this beer is not superb, this is a beer that demands to be contemplated, quite the tasting brew, and I am enjoying the complexity that is inherent in this tasty brew.  To finish, I have got to say ""damn I wish I lived in Michigan.""","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Rating # 640
Amazing! The body of this beer is a deep cherry wood amber, and the head is a mountain of off-white rocky cream; a big beautiful presentation in my tulip glass. The aroma is a full floral bouquet of fresh spring flowers. It is rather perfumEE, with strong cedar wood suggestions. A walk-in cigar humidor with fresh flowers under your nose. The flavor brings a complex intermingling of musty, doughy Belgian yeasts, with mention of citrus-like, piney, woodsy American hops. There is a large suggestion of freshly ground black pepper corns and a lighter hint of rosemary. The malt and hop is so delicately intertwined it adds a marvelous old world complexity. Towards the finish the spicier flavors of coriander and clove hit the palate, followed by orange and lemon then finalized by a tart hoppy / yeasty / oaky / citrusy BLISS! This is truly a unique, complex, and intriguing creation; one that firmly lives up to the self described expression Artisan Ale!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

As it collapses it forms peaks much like meringue. Ever so slightly off-white. Lacing is beautiful, big thick sheets cling to the glass. The aroma does not exhibit the barrel aging as much as the other Jolly Pumpkins I have had. Spicy, orange rind, coriander, and lots of yeasty character. The flavor shows more the barrel-aging, mediium oak and a good dose of hoppy bitterness. Malts come in next then the alcohol sneaks up. Everything comes together very well with this one.

Smelled pretty good. Maybe not hoppy enough , and with a peppery aroma.  Treated the palate nicely but really did not enjoy the peppery aftertaste.

Pours a transparent orangish-amber with a large white head that has some staying power.  The flavor starts with a nice mixture of citrus and light brett sourness that lingers  throughout.  There is a touch of vanilla in the background, but it becomes stronger as it warms and blends very well with the bret.    Corriander blends well in the finish with light floral hops and a hint of oak.

961,"2004-10-27",4.3,"Foggy orange. Fat, white meringue  deposits intricate, caked-on lacing all over the glass. Vibrantly tangy Hallertau aroma with notes of rosehips, coriander, candied ginger, and sweet orange peels. Chock-full of bubblegum, banana, and brashly phenolic esters, as well. Lush, velvety carbonation. Quenching, initially, with a creamed malt dollop and zesty hop splash. Remarkably bright and composed hop profile. Sneaky alcoholic warmth bolsters the coriander sting. Slowly intensifying heat from the Grains of Paradise yields soft notes of citrus and ginger. Leathery yeast gains more astringency and the sweetness becomes exaggerated as it warms. Boldly sweet, crackery malts are underlined with bananas & cream kissed with vanilla and pie crust. Utterly divine peppery yeast character fuses with the creaminess and continues to enhance the flavor. Finishes explosively juicy and poignantly hoppy, with  a blend of passionfruit, bananas, and yeast. Touch of tannins numb the tongue long after its departure, although the oak flavor is less prominent. Serving this slightly cold (45F), will suppress the sweetness and allow the bright hop character to shine. Saying this is refined, is an understatement.

961,"2004-10-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2006 Rerate AGAIN: this is just a killer beer. Rerate: the Spiciness has migrated to the aroma, with some alcohol thinning what you can get nasally as well. Dropped a notch there. But the flavors are so much more melded and mellow, with still a crescendoing spiciness over the long pull - much improved, along with the overall score. Original: Orangey-amber with a lasting head of a few mm. Quite spicy nose; sweet but very peppery, some earthiness - very deep and natural. Mucho effervescence in the mouth leads to the impression of a medium to thin body; certainly this is the slimmest of JPs beers as you drink it. Favors are very spicy now - lots of coriander for sure, a good dose of alcohol punch even at 6.5%, cinnamon too. When fully warm (and I mean sit-out-for-an-hour-in-a-glass warm), a very subtle undercurrent of cane sugar appears. This needs a bit of mellowing, I think, but it should only take two months if the maturation of its brethren is any indication. This brewery is also really maturing along with its beers. Cheers to Ron Jeffries.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
