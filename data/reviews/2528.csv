2528,"2016-01-31",3.2,"330ml bottle. Murky amber colour with average, thick, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of mango and passion fruit, some peach, a herbal touch of mint. Taste is moderately bitter hoppy, tropical fruity, hints of mango and passion fruit find insufficient support from a light, slightly sweet and minimally metallic, rather watery basis. Not any hint of elsewise typical doughy yeasty mugginess, flavourful in the way typical for Kehrwieder IPAs, ""but sorry, no bang"". Outstanding in its style.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"
