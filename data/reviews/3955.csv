3955,"2016-01-07",3.3,"Bottle at a local sushi place. Probably a bad choice to pair with the sushi, but live and learn. Poured an almost entirely clear color with a very light hue of pink to it. Aroma is light sweet plum notes, a touch of pitted cherries. Flavor is a touch medicinal - it reminds me a bit too much of the flavoring put in cough medicine, drinkable though.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
3955,"2015-02-24",3.6,"Super floral-y, tastes like the smell of a fresh bouquet, aftertaste a little perfume-y. Definitely plum taste, more in the beginning. I think its sweet, refreshing, and tasty.","Wisconsin, USA","MarinEvelyn"
3955,"2015-02-24",3.0,"Clear light pink. No head. Reminded of something like liquefied red gummi bears. Like candy, but not super sugary","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
3955,"2014-03-07",3.3,"(bottle - 300 ml) Very pale pink pour. Huge sweet plum aroma. No fermented notes. Very sweet plum flavor, almost like a plum candy. No fermented sake note at all. Sweet and a bit cloying.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
3955,"2013-02-26",3.0,"Pours a nice clear pinkish hue. Candied japanese plum (ume) on the nose. Drinks with 7/10-sweetness (much sweeter than the pear and raspberry), medium stickiness to the palate, straightforward ume flavour, mild cloying, very light alcohol detection, mild apple & pear notes finishing slightly sugary and mild alcoholic. Not much depth but very drinkable compared to the pear and raspberry.","","sulawang"

3955,"2011-04-24",3.2,"(750ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear plum colored with decent lacing. Nose of rosewater, plum, honey, and funky rice. Taste of sweet plum, sugar, liking the sweetness but its a bit over the top too.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3955,"2011-01-19",2.6,"botle, thanks to mora2000, color of pink champagne, no bubbles, sweet fruit punch aroma, flavor is paste and kool aid","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"

3955,"2010-12-28",3.1,"Slightly pink in color. Aroma is flowers, rice and plums. A fairly nice aroma overall. The flavor is rice and plums and the sake is very sweet. Hard to drink too much due to the high sugar content. No detectable alcohol.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3955,"2010-12-28",3.7,"Bottle courtesy mora2000. Pours a clear light pink color with a tiny bit of bubbles. Aroma is sweet fruit, plum, floral notes and powder. Flavor is soft sweet notes with sugary plums and candy notes. Finishes quite fruity. Interesting and sweet.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
3955,"2009-02-13",3.2,"Bottle from the Coop in Davis. Clear orange/pink color with a few small bubbles. Nice plum aroma. Love plum. Medium body with no carbonation. Nice plumy/oily impact in the mouth. Its a bit sweet, but it is so refined. Id happily drown in a cask of this. It is so not beer. On the other hand Id happily drown in a cask of Speedway Stout. Or Fullers Vintage Ale. Or Westy 12. But when its not beer, this is fun.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3955,"2008-10-17",2.6,"Im not part of the sake community, but I can imagine there are some pretty heated debates about whether infused sake is sake at all.  After having sampled the Moonstone Plum sake, Im prone to side with the traditionalists.  Its a nice, sweet drink, perfect for satisfying a sweet tooth.  But it has little semblance to sake itself, even in its myriad other styles.  The aroma is a bright, cherry-esque aroma, very sharp.  This is reflected in the taste which begins on a high, crisp cherry sweet note.  Its like all the good parts of cherry flavor cough medicine without the bad, harsher tones.  Only in the latter flavor does the plum flavor eke out, alongside the sweetness of darker, riper cherries.  Perhaps a little too sweet for me, but smaller bottles can make this a suitable dessert in lieu of something else.  Id rather have the cake or creme brulee.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3955,"2008-08-23",1.2,"Bottle from the bargain section in Kroger.Pours like cloudy dishwater with an aroms of body odor that was attempted to be covered up by air freshener.  Tastes like sweetened apple juice, and it smells like apple juice overkill.  Eh, it’s another feather in my cap.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
3955,"2008-03-12",3.8,"pours a light pink-rose colour ...
smell is of plum, cran,sprite ...
is quite sweet for a sake, even an infused... taste is very nice, smooth and sweet . simple yet enjoyable, only real drawback is the dull aftertaste.. no alcohol detected, more of a fruit juice than an alcoholic drink..  a truly enjoyable beverage but a dangerous one, i could drink this for hours, might be too sweet for some sake purists but a nice change of pace!  Definetly not a sake that one thinks of in the traditional sense of the drink...",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
3955,"2007-11-11",2.5,"Bottle from Party Source, KY in sampler set. Chilled. Poured clear pink color with minimal legs. Moderate sweet fruity aroma. Light to medium body with a sticky texture. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Drinkable sweet sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3955,"2007-05-28",2.0,"this sake tastes too sweet for me. the plum flavor, gives a cough syrup like feel to it. Best drunk in small doses.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3955,"2007-05-22",1.5,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2007 The aroma is SUPER sweet with the fruity plums that you would expect but almost NO rice or typical sake elements. The only other aroma is almonds. The appearance is clear pink. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. I like fruit flavors but this is just too artificial tasting for me.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3955,"2006-11-05",2.8,"Pour is clear pinkish rose color with some small somethings (yeast?) held in suspension...smell is strongly sweet with plums and raspberry and strawberry...sweet flavor with some plum and berry notes...Jordan had it right...very alcopop-ish...somewhat cloying and sticky at the end...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
3955,"2006-05-25",2.9,"Bottle: Pours a light pink color, like a zinfandel. The nose is sweet and fruity with  plum and berry notes. Nearly reminds me of St. Ides passionfruit, but much less repulsive. The flavor has a moderate body and theres a touch of rice and alcohol. The finish is nice. For such an odd flavor and light alcohol this certainly isnt much like a sake, but its drinkable. The alcopop of the sake world? Doesnt seem -88 sweet though.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3955,"2005-11-22",3.0,"Ichiban Restaurant, Baton Rouge, La. - served cold from a ceramic decanter. Clear pour with a hint of rose. Fruity, flowery aroma of pez candy, a hint of Hawaiin Fruit Punch, pleasant, but slightly artificial. Same fruitness carries over to the flavor, with a hint of spiciness whohc picks up near the finish. Alcohol is subdues, feel a slight burn in the finish. Refreshing, decent companion to sushi.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3955,"2005-07-07",2.9,"Pouring a clear, very pale rose color, this sake has a perfumey plum aroma.  The flavor is candy-like, still plum, but not so pleasant.  Althought a light ABV for a sake, it still finishes dry and peppery on the tongue... and sticky on the lips.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?
