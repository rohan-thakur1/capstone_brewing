3994,"2015-03-13",3.5,"22 oz bomber. The pour is a nice dark black with a off white pillowy white head and some spectacular lace. The aroma is incredibly malty. There is a beautiful roast to the point this is almost like a stout. Great tropical fruits like pineapple blast through. There is a touch of resin on the back end. The flavor is really bitter up front. Almost coffee like. Very bitterly roasty. There aren't a lot of other flavors. The hops are pretty non existent. The pine that was in the nose goes away. The mouth feel is really flat. Thin and slick with no carbonation. I'd hoped for so much more. The aftertaste is quick fading and a little bitter. Very disappointing beer

3994,"2014-02-27",3.8,"On tap at Joe Canals West Deptford.
Appearance: Pitch black body with a tall and dense khaki head that very slowly dissipates. 
Aroma: The aroma reminds me of an aged American barleywine. The whole musky-ish orange/grapefruit thats in a musky basement aroma. Theres a backing of chocolate with a hint of pine and perhaps smoke which Im enjoying. I just dont like the hop choice.
Taste: The hoppiness is rather big and semi-aggressive, but so is the malt base. I get a big grapefruit bite with mild pine backed by big chocolate malts, a hint of roasted malts, and light smoke and licorice on the finish. Great black IPA.
Palate: Full-bodied, slightly syrupy, with mild carbonation.
Overall: This is a top notch black IPA, on par with Wookey Jack. I think I prefer Wookey Jack, but this is damn good. I with the hop profile leaned more towards the piney flavors and I wish that there wasnt hints of licorice, but even so this is great.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Starkly coniferous, this Imperial Black IPA also possesses fruity angles which expand into floral spikes, as toasted bread crumbs ground moderate bitterness. Expressive, to say the least.

-A slice of foam covers the brown-edged black.
-The mouthfeel is rich yet soft.
-The hoppiness is brutal, but very flavorful and exactly as advertised.
-You have to be in the mood for intensity here, but when you are, its going to be satisfying.

3994,"2013-09-12",3.8,"Je verse une bière qui nest pas tout à fait noire dans mon grand verre de Shrek. Subitement, la mousse qui prend forme se déforme. On dirait quune dentelle arrive à saccrocher. Je plonge mon nez dans cette marée ténébreuse. Je sens du chocolat, des houblons américains, des épinettes et le parfum Acqua di Gioia de Giorgio Armani. Je porte le gobelet à mes lèvres. Je suis rapidement malmené par des houblons bien carabinés.  Le pamplemousse me vient en tête. La résine me colle entre les dents. Les malts noirs font ce quils peuvent et le font très bien. Jai un goût de gin Ungava qui me trotte sur les papilles. Mon palais surprend un corps plutôt léger. La texture huileuse ne souffre daucun complexe. Le pétillement juste mérite une attention. La finale est amère. Je ne sais plus comment ne plus aimer les choses brutalement longues et incendiaires.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

3994,"2013-09-10",3.9,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, lighter caramel, grapefruit/citrus hops, light roast, and a touch of pine. It pours a dark black with no transparency and a one finger tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good amount of thin webbing and rings on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with a quick dose of chocolate, roast, and a touch of caramel. The finish has a lot of citrus/grapefruit hops that dominate the little bit of pine that is there. While I wouldnt say you can taste any alcohol or feel any warmth, it does feel/taste ""big."". As it warms, the hops fade considerably in the nose and only slightly in the flavor. Its medium bodied with soft carbonation and a somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Overall, its probably the hoppiest Black IPA Ive had. I normally have expectations that a Black IPA is more than likely going to taste like hoppy Porter. However, in this instance, Im buying into the concept that this is actually a Double Black IPA.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

Its hard to tell whats stinging your tongue, the alcohol or the hops.  The hops get a bit earthier (although it might be the mellowing effect of the dark malt), but the bitterness just keeps coming with pine and grapefruit notes.  Its balanced by smooth, sweet molasses and dark caramel.   Theres also an underlying coffee component thats really nice.

The aroma was of a roasted sweet bread malt, pine and citrus hops and a bitter leathery yeast with notes of chocolate, coffee, citrus (grapefruit) and a touch of dark fruit (berries).

The taste started somewhat sweet and malty with notes of chocolate and coffee, and then had an influx of dark fruit with a bitter hoppy citrus peel ending. The flavor lingered for an extended period of time with a smooth, hoppy, chocolate bitterness left to settle on the taste buds.

Mouthfeel was almost medium in body with a very dry texture and a rather soft carbonation.

3994,"2012-08-02",4.2,"Poured into tulip glass...

Appearance: Pours out a dark color that I can only describe as black. It has a tight 2 finger khaki, chocolate milk colored head that sticks around for a surprisingly long time. Moderate lacing on this one. A nice looking black IPA.

Smell: Whew this is an interesting smelling beer. I was expecting much more hops on the nose but instead I get tons of dark malts. Im picking up toasted characteristics with nutty and biscuit, too. Some mild faint coffee in there also. Then and only then do I get some piney hops on the back end. This smell reminds me much more of a roasty stout than an IPA.

Taste: Oh my, a nice initial taste on this with the roasted coffee, chocolate, and sweetness. This is followed up by a great hop profile of pine hops and bitterness that prickles the taste buds and sticks around for a long time after the swallow. The alcohol at 11% is so well hidden behind all this goodness that it is almost non existent.

Mouthfeel: I think the feel on this beer is spot on for the style. It is medium with moderate carbonation and a creamy feel in the mouth. 

Overall: This to me is the best of both worlds in that it is combining a stout and an IPA. I love the melding of flavors in the two styles and the end result is very enjoyable. A sipping beer for me but dangerously so because of the alcohol being so well disguised. I like this beer!

3994,"2012-06-29",3.8,"Poured from a bomber into a plastic cup (don't judge me!).  Date on bottle is 2/12 so it isnt the freshest but it shouldnt be past its prime either  Pours a beautiful clear black if that's at all possible. Nice hearty brownish head and lacing. I can tell this is a substantial beer. Mouthfeel is actually lighter than I'd expect for a 10%abv but it's waaaaaaay to carbonated. Nice biting dry feel to it though. Aroma is dark malty with a splash of alcohol. Taste is dry with plenty of porter like taste. A good dose of piney hops are present too. Tons of chalk too. Overall I really liked this beer. Plenty of character to go around.

This is my kind of beer from a current favorite brewer, who is to Boston what Three Floyds is to Chicago.

This does smell of warming alcohol, unfortunately not enough to break up the stuffy nose Ive got. Solid black body, slightly foamy stout-colored head. I let my regular Hoppy Feet sit too long, but lets see what a year does to this one: Taste is in the Impy stout territory, still a lot of roastiness in the malts, which Id hoped would smooth a little bit by now. Still a lot of piney hop resin banging away on my taste buds.

When trying a new brewery why not go big? Instead of starting with the regular Hoppy Feet I picked up a bottle of its big brother. I dont know if this is a one off or a seasonal; either way should it be brewed again get a fresh bottle and enjoy a fantastic big release.

Aroma / Appearance - Deep oily black fluid pours a bit like stale oil. Rich mocha head is almost the color of an imperial stout. Black coffee, resin, and licorice prove this means business. I will have to try the regular Hoppy Feet to see if it really doubles down everything but the profile is very heavy and intense.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate, coffee, anise, and maple chew at the palate. Coating the senses the depth is there from the start. Big but balanced this does suffer the lopsided flaws of some beers that just amp up ingredients for the sake of it. If this is an average beer for Clown Shoes I look forward to the two or three others that are in the cellar.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3994,"2011-12-22",4.6,"Dark brown body was mostly opaque, and the head atop was quite large at three to four fingers thick.  While it looked like a stout, it certainly did not smell like one.  The hops were very noticeable in the piney and earthy smell.  There was a touch of chocolate at the end of each whiff, betraying the presence of dark malts.  The taste was perfectly straddling the line between a stout and a DIPA.  The hops were clearly there in the bitterness up front, which was followed by a different, more astringent bitterness from the roasting of the grains.  There was also a small amount of sweetness that alternated between molasses and rock candy.  The aftertaste was very bitter, and lingered long after the beer had already passed the throat.  Very silky mouthfeel with no harshness.  Phenomenal beer from a brewery whose products are newly being distributed around here.  I will be back for more of your beers very soon.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Flavor is as much split wood as anything but charred oak, chocolate,  and licorice notes come and go and are more prominent upon warming. There is a consistent yet vague bitterness from start to finish. This bitterness is a little too much, but thats my sole nit pick. My guess is that it comes more from the black malt than any hopping. Stone Sublimely is still the undisputed champion but I really like this. This is a session beer for imperial stout fans.

Strong grapefruit and piney hops from start to finish with a subtle hint of roasted malt weaving in and out.

3994,"2011-09-22",3.2,"Bomber, about 2 months out from bottling.  The pour yields an extremely dark, charred mahogany colored body that is impenetrable at the center.  A small but lasting head of smooth, mocha tinted foam leaves dense band of solid tapestry lace all around the glass.  The nose is indeed quite hoppy, showing notes of resinous pine and semi-oily orange pith over a base of sweet blackened caramel, dark chocolate, and licorice.  Theres a little bit of roast, but the caramel really overpowers it.  Flavors largely follow suit, hitting with a strong blast of piney, bitter hops, nodding also towards citrus.  Bittersweet chocolate and darkly toasted caramel provide ample balance, showing a high concentration of residual sugar.  Roast comes through on the lengthy, hoppy finish.  The palate is huge, sticky, and syrupy, with low to moderate carbonation.  In short, ton of malt....ton of hops....not alot of ingenuity or refinement.

3994,"2011-09-07",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2011 (10/30/2011) Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet 1.5 Double Black India Pale Ale is a pitch black ale with a huge, lumpy, beige head. It looks like a bowl of coffee ice cream. The foam covers the glass in a solid sheet. Citrus and grass are shrouded in dry roast to make a big and bold, yet very well balanced aroma. There are notes of orange, coffee, chocolate and caramel. Its full bodied, very smooth, soft and creamy. The finish is dry and it leaves the tongue stunned and the back of the teeth a little gritty. The flavor is huge and complex. Its a bit sweet and grassy at first and then a strong bitterness rolls in along the lines of orange peel. Then its dark roast coffee, a bump of dark caramel and then a baking chocolate finish that has a hint of juniper. This is pretty face melting. Even after 22 ounces, it continues to amaze and entertain. These guys make shockingly modern beer and I love it.

(9/7/2011) Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet 1.5 is a cola black ale with a huge, foamy, turbanado sugar colored head that stays put and leaves fancy lacing all down the glass. It has an aroma of pine, lemon and burnt sugar. Tons of hop juiciness is detected. Its full bodied and creamy on the tongue. The finish is pretty chewy and it leaves the mouth a little raw. This beer is jarringly bitter, raising my heart rate, quickening my breath, dropping my jaw. Nice. The bitterness has a big juniper quality. It is resiny, wooden, almost smokey. Theres light sweetness and almost a hint of melanoids. Its blurringly bitter, hot, boozy syrup. The blackness doesnt give a hint of coffee, but there may be a blackstrap flavor to this. This is not for the hoi polloi. It would kill them. This is a beer for you, Mister Beer Snob. Someone used some science to get a fluid that packed with this much flavor into your mouth and Im impressed with that. These Clown Shoes guys are off the handle.

Nose has the elements of black ipa...the roasty malts, the piney hops...but they combine in ways others do not...soft, cashmere-like...chocolate, fudge, and coffee underneath the roast...spicy christmas vibes underneath the hops...an inviting nose for the style here.  Flavors do not let down in the slightest...the roasty malts still have chocolate and coffee and add some caramel and licorice spice to it...the piney spice of the hops is remarkably complimenting...making each component of the malts come to a coherent point in the finish.

3994,"2011-06-25",3.3,"Poured from bombers for ""An Evening with Clown Shoes Beer"" at Lunar Brewing Co.. Displayed a dark, black/brown hue, modest, cream & bubbles, light tan head that reduced rather quickly to a ring and film, but left some decent cling to the lacing. The aroma was bakers chocolate roasty, potent pine and citrus hop notes, a little wood and smoke, a touch of creaminess, and an off scent that I could only describe as a combination of caramel, vanilla and earthiness. The flavor, although malt bountiful and full bodied, was lasting, aggressive hop bitterness that was on the astringent side to me, and hooked up with plenty of dryness to make up the finish. Warming, and followed the big hop and dryness theme for the evening, but I was more than happy with the regular Hoppy Feet.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

3994,"2011-06-06",3.8,"A - Pours a rich dark black color with just a bit of brown mixed in and a big finger-plus of frothy brownish head. The head hangs around for a while leaving some nice lacing behind.

S - Aroma is full of a nice balance of roasted caramel malts and earthy hop aromas. There is also a bit of what seems like chocolate in the background.

T - Starts off heavy on the roasted caramel malts with only a bit of hop bitterness in the background. Through the middle, the earthy hop flavor grows and stronger roasted flavors come through as well. As the beer finishes, the hop and roasted flavors balance themselves out better and linger with a touch of booze.

M - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels very smooth and even a touch creamy. The roasted and bitter flavors create a nice dry feeling in the mouth.

D - Very drinkable. The flavors start out a bit all over the place and roasted heavy, but seem to strike a nicer balance at the end. That being said, the balance is nicer in the aroma and that is where the beer really shines.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

If you happen to read this review, shoot me a message if you know why this isnt topping the charts for style. As far as my opinion goes, I think this is delicious. I love malt and hoppy brews and when you blend them like this, Im in hop heaven....or is it The maltboy mansion ( you know that place where beauties walk around bearing all their wonderful qualities while an old man with white hair and a nasty robe introduces you to malty beauties named Caramel, Burnt Sienna and Chocolate)....anyway, back to the point.

3994,"2011-05-09",3.4,"A: The beer pours a dark brown color with a massive light brown head that leaves some nice lacing.

S: Floral and piney hop notes with some mild citrus and grass.  Theres a fairly pronounced roastiness to this beer (not super surprising), but it sort of becomes too much and overwhelms the hops.

T: An enormous amount of roast and some bitter dark chocolate really kill any chance of this being super hoppy.  As it stands, thats okay to me in this case.  Pretty bitter but only a mild citrus and pine hop flavor.

M: Heavy on the tongue with a medium to high level of carbonation.

O: This was a good beer, but its not a terribly good black IPA.  Far too heavy and too much roast without enough hop flavor.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3994,"2011-05-06",3.8,"Bottle. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass a clear but very dark brown color with a 1 finger mocha tan head. If on looks, youd think this was a porter or something like that. Nice rich citrus hops in the aroma all baked together with a roasty coffee note as well. Sweet, malty, orange and grapefruit and then BAM, you get hit with a rich roasty flavor with dark chocolate that then transitions to a both a rind bitterness and roast bitterness. Mildly soapy in the end as well. Black IPAs are an interesting breed and one that I think people either love or hate as they play a tough balance between true IPA/DIPA and something dark. I happen to be a fan of these and like this one, the only knock that I have is the mild soapiness. Ends with some nuttiness as well.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"

The head recedes to leave blebby lacing.  Aromas are predominantly roasted cocoa and bitter chocolate, with pine sap and needles, bark, and earth.  Some light caramel and honey are present.  The flavor is bitter grapefruit peel, dark roasty chocolate malt and earthy bitterness, cocoa, and some sweet mocha/caramel.  A bitter, citrusy finish rounds things out.  This verges on creamy, with low/medium carbonation and medium body, and a slight warming quality alongside a dry finish.  The ABV is pretty well hidden.

Flavors are likewise roasted-malt forward...chocolate, toast, molasses, caramel, but the strongly bitter citrus and earthy hopping is certainly prominent, mainly in the aftertaste.  Hop bitterness also tends  to dry the palate out in the lingering finish.  Big abv also adds to a very dry finish ( almost too dry?)   Quite nicely brewed...a lot going on...and an interesting experiment.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
3994,"2011-04-24",3.0,"Picked this bottle up at Julios before EBF. Served in a Bruery tulip.

Pours nearly black with a light tan head and some good spotty lacing. The nose brings forward some piney hops and a bit of roast. There is a mild earthiness to the nose as well. The flavor has many of the same characteristics, but also has a bit too much alcohol flavor. Quite a lot too much, actually. Bitterness and alcohol layer with a medium body. Lots of bitterness carries through the finish. Decent, but not something I would seek out again.

3994,"2011-04-15",4.0,"22oz bottle. Pours a black body with an inch thick, dense and creamy, brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is solid. Lots of fresh, sweeter citrus pines and a balanced roast alongside. A nice, rich chocolate with a hint of mint as well as a medium sweet caramel maltiness. The hops have a good amount of resins, oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines. Flavor is really nice as well. Much more balanced than the regular Hoppy Feet. Lots of caramel and chocolate up front with a sweet citrus pine. A good amount of roast quickly comes in along with some more citrusy oranges, tangerines, and grapefruits. Resins and some earth come out towards the end as this finishes dry, roasty, citrusy, and piney with a higher bitterness that isnt nearly as brash and lopsided as the regular Hoppy Feet. There is a really nice dark, richer chocolate and caramel presence to balance the dry bitterness. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium, smooth body and moderate, soft carbonation. Overall, a very well made Imperial Black IPA. This is quite bold in the bitterness and roastiness, but has a much better balance and citrusy aspect than the original Hoppy Feet. Really nice chocolate and caramel presence while still allowing this to completely dry out and drink pretty aggressively. Alcohol is extremely well hidden as well. I thoroughly enjoyed this bold, but balanced beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
