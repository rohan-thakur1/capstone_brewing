2066,"2015-11-21",4.0,"Pours a hazy deep gold with medium frothy head. Aroma is fruity, mostly citrus, and funky yeast. Taste is very sweet, but enoyjable, not cloying. Body is great-- thick and a bit syrupy, which keeps it on the palate long enough to really experience the flavors, but not so much that its gross. Very mild hint of bitterness on the finish. Very enjoyable and well balanced. Cant detect the high ABV at all. First beer of this style Ive tasted.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","sigh_borg"
2066,"2015-03-25",3.8,"On Draught
Pours a lightly hazy blonde color with a decent head and good lacing on the glass.

The aroma is nicely floral with some faint banana and soft mineral character. The aroma also has some sweet dough and some leafiness. Its complex enough but also inviting. 

The flavor is nicely fruity and spicy with a good herbal hoppiness throughout. There is some sweet dough and light banana up front but the beer is dry in the finish. The level of bitterness is a low to medium and is very well employed and balanced here. There is very little alcohol character here, Im very surprised to see that its 7+

Refreshing beer & its always cool to see someone pull out a successful attempt at Bière de Garde.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Definite sweetness as expected but also a subtle tartness and plenty of spice notes. It is very clean and very christmas-like in character.

2066,"2014-11-29",3.7,"Sampled at the STL Hops 7th Anniversary Party - Pours hazy golden orange with a dense beige head. The aroma has nectar fruit, toast and basement must. It has a medium crisp body, but still lush and has minor sharp carbonation. The flavor starts with musty cellar funk, dry spices and toasty malt. The finish is much more traditional to the style than most US version. Quite nice.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
