TASTE: full-bodied, intense and punishing with its grapefruit, raisin, plum and pineapple... the malts come across as light biscuit... the yeasts, again, develop a bubblegum and peppercorn combination--what a complete bottle...OVERALL: A rare catch at Mountain Valleys bottom shelf and an awesome reconnect with a bottle hand-selected by Russells (Bloomsburg, PA) owner himself about a decade ago... one of the best Belgians I have encountered, claiming an experience in itself... big and bold but just warm enough to miss perfection--but not by much!","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

Sweet onset with lots of caramel malts and orange, strong carbonation, smooth, evolving into a rewarding dry, flowery and herbal hop bitterness, supported by a lot of warming alcohol, on the brink of becoming astringent but just managing to remain undisturbing.

Fantastisk syn at åbne og ophælde denne Abbey Tripel! Øllet er gyldent, men dét, man lægger mærke til, er den kæmpe mæssige hvide skumkrone på 7-9 cm, der fint lægger sig i glasset. Småboblende og fin hvid, næsten som æggehvide! Langsomt langsomt ""falder"" kronen ned til ca. 4 cm, mens der spreder sig en duft af banan og eksotisk frugt såsom papaya og god kraftig alkohol. 
Majestætisk smag! Meget fin balance mellem bitterhed og sødme og en meget kompleks øl. Der er den fine sødme, som dominerer i starten og dernæst kommer den gærende og malt/humlede bitterhed og slutter smagen af. Med den varmende alkohol fra de 10 %. Iøvrigt har den ""dalende"" skumkrone nu dannet det mest fantastiske snelandskab i overfladen. 
Kuldioxid indholdet i brygget ligger fint i samspil med øltypen: lettere nedskruet i.f.t. medium, men ikke så meget at øllet ikke føles friskt.

3241,"2014-04-03",3.7,"330ml bottle into a goblet. There is no age stamped on the cap but judging by the other De Dolle beers at the liquor store, this one is probably around 2008 vintage.

Pours a very dirty dark gold with lots of specks in it. However the head is a very billowy, frothy bright white with a few specks of yeast so I have to give it some credit for that.

Right off the bat in the aroma I can tell this beer has some age. The sherry/wet cardboard note of oxidation is quite present and overpowers anything else. Apple is very strong along with notes of plums and dark fruit; sort of out of character for a triple.

The flavor continues the oxidized notes. More apple and plums along with sherry. The oxidation character starts to become a little too much as the flavor lingers. There is almost a touch of smokiness about it but not in a real good way. This beer definitely does not have the characteristics of a Tripel that I was expecting. Mouthfeel is quite sticky; not dry like I was hoping for.

3241,"2013-08-18",4.6,"330ml bottle bought at Craftissmo in Tsim Sha Tsui East.
Colour: Cloudy hazy dull light straw brown, with lots of scrappy, dirt-like brownish yeast sediments.

Looks: Explosive three finger head with lasting, crumpety off white foams. Very sticky lacing and fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and very dark fruit-driven which can be smelt more than half a foot away, including very strong plums, figs, raisins, candy sugar, perfume, floral, strong Belgian yeast, malt, spices, and light alcohol. 

Taste: Very rich and fulfilling sweet bliss of plums, raisins, dark fruits, blossoms and Belgian yeast, with malts, molasses, spices, light liquorices, light citrus and light herbal hops.

Body: Full body, rich and very slick palate.

Mouth Feel: an incredibly nice and rich plum and figs plus nice flowers, with the kind of matching good strong sweetness you know that only works in strong Belgian brews, and it makes me happy. :) Theres more: strong yeasty taste thanks to a hefty dose of scappy brown yeasts provides a good balance for the sweet taste, yummy!

Booze: Lightly-tasted all the way. 10%? I sure dont feel that at all throughout the session. A telling sign of a top brew. 

Hoppiness: rather low and muted, in total contrast with the likes of Westmalle Tripel and Chimay White. Mostly floral nose, hint of citrus plus spicy herbal hop taste, and fairly light but palatable bitterness for a satisfying finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry after taste. Pleasantly sweet, rich and easy to mouth.

Comments: Saved this one for my 300th RB rating and what a wise choice Ive made :) This is in many aspect an excellent Tripel / BSA - incredibly rich and fragrant dark fruit and floral nose and taste, matching sweetness and light booze, and a good strong dose of Belgian yeast. Wow, what an experience! It may not have the customary banana and caramel elements, but its no longer important in this case. Mad Bitch? Im just as mad as you! A winner!

3241,"2013-07-21",4.0,"Appearance:
Deep orange under a pithy head which lingers as a thin film with thick edges that try to crawl up the sides of my glass.

Nose:
Acidic in the back with slightly fermented fresh citrus and fruits  pears, apricots, kiwi, green grapes, and honeydew. Meaty chewy sourdough in the middle. Grape musk. Banana peel and aloe plant. Ginger, fennel, and star anise.

Palate:
Hits with spice  ginger, fennel, and star anise. Wine and oak  pinot grigio and oaked chardonnay for some nice caramel notes. Grape musk in the back. Sticky stewed kiwi and honeydew. Rustic underneath with green banana peel. Big and bold, delicate and complex. Yeasty doughy sourdough bread in the middle for some chew and to help soak up all the flavors. A bit more ginger in the back.

Final Thoughts:
Another intense beer from the mad brewers of Belgium. My bottle was from May 2010 so it had some nice age to it which proved not in the least way detrimental to my enjoyment. Delicious.

Boozy is pleasant, alcohol is chemical and unpleasant.  Nice carbonation, not too prickly and it actually seems a little thin.  Overall, this is the best tripel Ive ever had.

G8 label and bottle. Really love the graphics here. Stunning. 

White lacing which diminishes quickly leaving a golden red-glow of a beer sediment is there but not too much and very easy on the eye. 

The aroma is shit loads of candi sugar, fudge, marzepan, hey and toffee and caramel. Taste is burnt toast, caramel, toffee, fudge cake, some bubblegum, really nice balance, stunning mouth feel, wow really wish this was a local pint as i would love to session this next to Crouch Vale amarillo, the sparkles fly out at you like the most orgasmic fizz-bomb your mouth can tolerate. really epic mouth feel this, one of the best palates Ive experienced, incredibly velvety off the tongue and a lovely burnt caramel finish which leaves me gasping. This is glorious and a stunning Belgian beer. VERY happy that this didnt gush all over the place so great handling by those brewdog scamps.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"

Pours a hazy dark orange color with a big, frothy off-white head.  Aroma of Belgian yeast, honey, candi sugar, sweet malts, and butter.  The flavor is also very sweet, malty, yeasty, and buttery.

Also some spices seems to come up. Its a bit hard to smell something, but that what you can smell is good. Taste is pretty well balanced. Some sweetness, sourness and biterness seems to play in my mouth, with the sweetness making the most noise of the 3 at the same time. Spices, some fruits, banana and caramel comes up. Really good brew, I think its one of the better tripel Ive tasted. Maybe just slightly to much sweet-bitterness. But that makes the beer so tastefull, much better then so many water-beers.

The taste is toast, light caramel, moderate banana and clove, dank hops, slight pepper, slight honey. Overall more sweet than anything else. The honey and candy sugar are very prominent and the hops and usual tripel tastes are dulled behind the sweetness. The alcohol has been dulled with aging and the 10% is hardly noticeable (no burn). Another great De Dolle beer (Still Nacht and Oerbier Reserva are still the best). This is great too though :)  Forgot to mention that it exploded with carbonation but I managed to capture most of it.

Taste- Sweet fruits... maybe pineapple? The aforementioned starfruit really stands out here, bitter and tart. Theres also a nice layer of spiciness that I cant quite put my finger on.

That is the first time I have been able to pull out a cork with my fingers and the beer wasnt completely flat.  Pours a perfectly clear gold with an almost impossibly thick, creamy starched white head, that grows unbelievably quickly.  Dense lacing left all around the inside of the glass.  Biscuity, pale malt aroma, with a perfect amount of sweetness...with touches of honey, ripe apricots, warm dough and lemony hay.  Beautifully developed palate...what I can imagine as a once highly over-carbonated palate has mellowed into a velvety tingle across the tongue, delivering touches of bitterness, lightly warmed malts, and sweetness in a perfect balance.

3241,"2010-04-29",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2010 Bottle.

A - A clouded, golden brown honey color. Small, foamy, white head that disappears instantly leaving no lacing behind.

S - Plenty of ripe golden fruit (apple, pear, melon, pineapple, tangerine, some peach and apricot). Some spice and Belgian yeast along with some candi sugar, honey, and a hint of vanilla.

T - Good amount of lighter malt and golden fruit (similar fruit smell to the smell), along with some sugar and vanilla. Mid-sip, more fruit comes out along with a fair amount of spice (clove, coriander, a touch of pepper, and a faint whisper of cinnamon and coriander. A touch of alcohol sneaks in, but it is very well hidden. Well balanced beer. Overall, slightly sweet but balanced.

M - Medium body with medium to low carbonation. Very smooth and creamy beer.

D - Good drinkability. Solid and balanced Tripel. Easy on the palate, but also quite stimulating to it. 

Notes: Vintage 2009. Pretty good Trippel, but not necessarily my favorite. Well balanced and a solid offering of the style. Alcohol is well hidden and there is a good mix of flavors. It looks like I may have been unlucky and got a bottle with something wrong with the carbonation (no real head). Still fairly good offering though. Worth a try, but nothing special.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

A-Body is a very cloudy dark gold with some amber hues. Pours with a nice 2 finger creamy white head which fades to 1/2 finger and has perfect retention. Traces of lacing are left behind in the glass.

S-A Belgian candy sugar like sweetness comes through first followed by so sweet yeast. Floral hops and a touch of alcohol pack a big punch at the end.

T-Upfront are flavors of exotic fruit such as mango and peach...maybe some pineapple and a big sugary sweetness. Behind this is a healthy yeast backbone. A big punch of floral hops come through for the finish along with a touch of alcohol bitterness. A slight alcohol warmth lingers.

P-Low to medium carbonation and very smooth, creamy, yeasty body. There is an alcohol consistency in there too though, so beware.

O- Let this warm a bit before drinking it. Its downright awful and boozy when its cold. Once it warms a bit plenty of more complex characteristics come through and this one really shines. A pretty good beer overall.

Not really the most attractive shade of brownish-orange, but the head on it is great. Classic tripel nose of apples and pears, with orange oil, pepper, clove, and grass. Very pleasant-smelling. Flavor is also very smooth and full, with zero alcohol presence to hinder the enjoyment. Estery up front with pears and candied orange, then a nice caramel/toffee character that takes over until the finish, which is grassy with a modest but welcome bitterness. The body is sublime on this one, perfection. The only complaint here is that it is over-carbonated. A few swirls around the glass immediately reconstitute a nice head while simultaneously getting rid of the excess bubbles. In terms of flavor and aroma this is basically the quintessential tripel.

Further aromas present in the form of Christmas angelfood cake, and pie dough- nunce the grain. The most modest of alpha acids are present- only enough to entice the nostrils but never overpowering or abrasive. Doughy with the quintessential De Dolle bugs. Flavor is like putting orange, lemon and grapefruit in a blender with copious sugar (of the most widely varied and stereotypical Belgian types), adding sugary lactose, and gratuitous ethanol. Baller.

Malt, in a big way. Sweet bread mixes with candy sugar. Citrus notes. Apple, pear, peach. Nice warmth from the 10% ABV, but not overdone. A light touch of hops provide a nice bit of balance.

Feels like liquid velvet, as all of the best tripels should, IMO. Lots of tiny little bubbles help provide a smooth creamy body. Wonderful.

Nose is honey, and sour and funky like a lambic-lite--its just toned down a bit. Theres some sweet malt in there, too. Taste is sweet and bready, and finishes with an herbal presence.

Honestly, this beer has apricots, some light red fruit, fresh buttered toast, and nice creaminess.  Hauntingly as familiar as Blanc de Noir Champagne, really.
Behind that is another world of fresh stone fruit and layers of exotic spice as the rambunctious CO2 expands over the palate and lets these flavors seep into every nook and cranny.  As the beer finishes a coating of spiced pears rests on the tongue with a touch of cream and a grating of fresh nutmeg.  Yes, it is complex.

3241,"2009-05-12",4.2,"Pours from the bottle a slightly cloudy, dark golden color with a thick, white head that fades on top of a very highly carbonated beer, so much so that there are bubble popping faster than soda. Aroma reminds me of the tartness sometimes found in a chardonnay. Aroma holds a lot of biscuit and bready notes, light citrus and spice hoppiness with some sour apple coming through toward the end.  Flavor begins with a grape and apple dry fruitiness followed by a nice biscuit malt presence and finishes with a sweet candi sugar and spicy hop note.  Alcohol is very sharp at the end but melds very well with the very dry ending of the beer.  The alcohol definitely warms your throat after the swallow. Carbonation produces a beer which is very lively in you mouth, producing  bubbles that pop exploding taste everywhere.

The aroma is very light with lots of light fruit, apples and pears maybe, with some sweetish pale malts.  Some lemons hang around the nose as well, though not too intrusive or tart.

The taste is a slight step up from the aroma as the sweetness kicks up a notch with light fruits still playing the major role but with some candi sugar thrown in for good measure.  The citrus comes out a bit more than the aroma and balances the sweetness of the fruits and yeast very well.

The mouthfeel is very smooth and actually pretty sticky with the fruity and sugary sweetness on the palate.

Rich tropical fruit esters rise from a chunky, straw colored liquid.  Slight funky flavors brighten the high gravity of this beer, along with an expectedly aggressive carbonation.

Very slow to settle, and very heavy on the lace.  The aroma was made of apricot, lemon zest, sugar-coated orange peel, and some alcohol.  The flavor heavily favored dried orange peel and alcohol warmth, with some mild honey and caramel coming in at the finish.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and creamy smooth.  Moderately carbonated with a slightly dry finish.  The aroma didnt come across as overly inviting, but the flavor was very nice, if not a little alcoholic.

Huge creamy white head that holds and sizzles long and fades to a rocky inch-tall head and stays there (great head).  Aroma is unbelievable; I am not the biggest belgian fan, but this is the most full, delicious, complex, creamy, refreshing, and UNIQUE belgian aroma I have encountered. Hints of bannana, vanilla, soft alcohol, sugary cherries, oak, candisugar (but not overly dominating like many other belgians I have had), and more.  The flavor is good, but not as balanced.  It starts very sugary sweet (pale malt and candi sugar) with some nutty notes, which transitions slowly into a strange bitter sourness, and then about 5 seconds after swallowing fades into a great fruity and creamy finish dominated by vanilla oak and cherries.  A bit of booze on the nose, very warming on the stomach.  Medium bodied on the palate with very active carbonation that prickles the mouth.

Thankfully, the taste does not reflect this, but is still a very heavy tripel. The residual sugars are palpable. Definitely not as enjoyable or refreshing as a Westmalle.

It was difficult to pour of the sediment, so there were specks of sediment loosed into the glass. The aroma is thick and complex - vinous white raisins, thick malts, and a slight note of perfume. The flavor starts malty and sweet with heavy and delectable light-colored malts. There is a light, spicy, floral hop note that provides balance and a soft, fruity ester profile. At mid-tongue, the beer is lightly hoppy with sweet malts. The finish is dry with a nice hop bitterness to balance the malts. The mouthfeel is full, but definitely lighter than other De Dolle brews I tried this evening (Boskeun and Arabier). The carbonation is vigorous and tickles the tongue - in fact, it almost feels like the bubbles numbed the very tip of my tongue. Overall, a very malty tripel - sweet and tasty. It was not nearly as strongly hopped as I remembered - I shared a big bottle with a friend way back in 2001. That big bottle was a gusher, and it smelled and tasted very strongly of Saaz hops.

What an amazing smelling beer. I am expecting some serious hops but you can’t tell it from the nose. The citrus is the only hint. This is not hoppy at all? In fact this probably the best tripel I have ever had. Much in the vain of Triple Karameliet. This is so creamy on the palate. Truly amazing. Another magical creation from the masters at De Dolle. I bet this is incredible in the Reserve form. If you expect a hop bomb here, you won’t get it, this is creamy smooth. There are hops there but only for flavor the bitterness is completely overshadowed by the creamy flavor with a hint of tart. Alcohol is almost non existant. The palate is thinner than some of their others but I think thats due to the creaminess.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
3241,"2008-07-09",3.8,"From bottle. Has a dry and mildly funky nose at first, bit of aged straw with a hint of lactic acidity. Mild yeasty aroma, with some lemon rind and light bubblegum. Some floral hoppiness, but faint. Hazy golden amber liquid with a foamy-pillowy off-white lacing, lasting head. Medium bodied, with medium to heavy carbonation and a distinct alcoholic warming among the fizzy quality. Starts with boozy alcoholic warmth, pilsner malt and some honey. Candi sugar sweetness and a bit of carbonic acidity. Yeasty notes with decent chalky bitterness in the finish, but still plenty of sweet and vaporous alcohol. This is one you can feel. Pear and grain, honey and wheat. Light astringent-sweet after.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
3241,"2008-07-05",4.3,"Bottle.  Pours deep hazy gold with some lovely stray bits floating around and sending bubbles up to the foamy white head that sits atop.  Nose offers candied apricots, perhaps a bit of banana, some malt and burnt sugar and a fruity bread wallop (think banana bread or fruitcake, but yeastier.  Bit of a hoppy nose for a tripel, too.  Similar palate, with added distinction of an orange peel oil flavor from the hops added to the mix and a pretty big alcohol punch.  This is an excellent beer; I’d say the alcohol burn is my only real critique.  Other than that, it’s not too far from perfect.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"

The flavor was an absolutely crazy, yeasty, malt-fruit with a significant alcohol tingle-burn all around the palate.  The alcohol runs out in front of all things: aroma, taste, palate.  The mixture of flavors that I admittedly coudnt distinguish because it was such a menagerie were shocking at times.  Definately a sipper that left me, not a small man, mind you, a bit light-headed by the end.

Tastes a whole octave lower than it smells: the pepper fire is here too, but there is a lower, dark cardamom accented malt as well. Very drinkable for such a strong beer, but warming too.

Mixed flavors of citrus, light molasses, plum pits, clove, peaches, and maybe other stuff. As the sweetness slips away, there is a bitterness attributable to hops. Finally an astringency develops.

The classic banana appears in peaks and valleys and is joined with caramel, plum, and cinnamon.  Once i drank 2/3 of the bottle i swirled the remaining liquid to lift up the sediment and poured the rest in the glass to turn it a shade darker toward brown.

3241,"2007-08-04",4.2,"330ml bottle.

Pours a very cloudy golden with a massive four finger head that takes a good ten minutes to fade to a thick cap. The remaining foam leaves behind a ton of lace on the glass.

Snell; it took a while before I could get a goof whiff of this one with the huge head. Once it settles though there was a bunch of tropical fruits with pineapple, tangerine and peaches. Theres also a pretty good malty backbone in here, and a bit of a spiciness form the yeast.

Taste; the fruits are very evident with the pineapples and peaches coming through the most, but theres a really nice earthy/herbal presence that I wasnt expecting. The sweet malts come through as caramel, sugar cookies and a little honey. The finish is a touch on the spicy side from the yeast and some alcohol.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a bit of a biting carbonation, and the drinkability is good. I bought my bottle several months ago, and it took me forever to get around to it because I was a little sick of tripels at the time. Im glad I waited until now because I think I enjoyed more now than I would have when I purchased it.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

The aroma is fruity, spiced, and very complex. It has a distinct tartness, with hints of cloves, apricot, lemon, and just a slightly sour funk. The flavor is pretty well done. Its not as sweet or dessert like as I was expecting. There are plenty of tart and bittersweet notes throughout. Cloves, banana, oranges, lemon zest, sour dough. . . the flavor profile is very expansive.  This finishes on a floral, vegetal, spicy note with just minimal doughy sweetness.

It pours a fizzy golden amber with a medium light tan head.  Pretty heavy alcohol and orange in the scent.  The taste is more mellow than the smell.  Light sweet orange, sweet malts, and other citrus.  Definitely can taste the age in this one as its lost a little of its bite.  Still very nice.  Carbonation has held on well.

3241,"2007-02-04",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2008 Two separate ratings for this one. From a corked 750ml bottle, huge thanks to Dorwart.   The bottle is about 6 years old at this point, and if coerced properly, the head does not rise and surge out of the bottle for a full 45 minutes.  The key is to just let the blessed thing stand for awhile before popping it.  Historically magnificent nose of oak, lemon, yeast, hay, and soft light fruits.  Pour varies wildly based on how the bottle has been handled.  Hazy yellow-golden, growing darker orange toward the bottles end.  Flavor is a wild collage of many elements married into one cohesive vision.  Kind of oaky, yeasty, funky lemon dominates, but not so dry like a geuze, its  warm, rich, and elegant.  Rum, cheese, and lighter fruits shine as well.  Extraordinarily lush and smooth, pretty much the perfect beverage. 10,4,10,4,19 = 4.8

33cl bottle, various vintages.  Very different beer from the 750ml version.  Im honestly not sure whether the recipe is the same of whether age just transforms this beer massively.  Nose and mouth present alot of nectarine, apple, yeast, but finishes with a long, kind of bitter note that isnt entirely pleasant.  I would just buy a case and let it sit for 5 years as an experiment.  8, 4, 7, 4, 15 = 3.8","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

Strange one, this.  The bottle may not have been good, as it burst out with foam upon popping the cap.  Poured great after that.  Neat aroma.  But the taste was . . . well, different than I should think a Tripel or any beer should be.  It wasnt pleasant at first.  Something of a blend between tart and . . . metallic.  Off-putting and harsh.  Then I got more used to it as I proceeded.  By the bottom of the glass it was hardly off-putting at all; more a mellow Tripel with some mild tartness.  Maybe Ill try another bottle.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

3241,"2007-01-15",4.2,"Appearance...looking in the bottle, there are tons of yeast particles held in suspension with a small yeast bed stuck on the bottom. The pour gives way to a hazy, pale, orange toned gold with a gigantic, fluffy white head that slowly fades out. Beautiful smounts of fluff stick to the sides of the glass.
Smell is of honey, apricot, lemon, tangerine, sugary, florally, poached pear, mild banana & coriander, along with a touch of funk that is welcomed and enticing.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a very nice dose of yeast that makes me want to culture the strain out of the bottle and go nuts come my next homebrew session.
Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, mildly sweet, and addictive. Tiny carbonation bubbles are aggressive at first. but turn to a smoothness that delivers nicely.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
3241,"2007-01-14",4.2,"Pours a cloudy gold with a ton, and I mean TON, on nearly white head. The head is thickly packed. It takes a long while to die back, and when it does, it leaves fantastic lace. I sense a mildly tart aroma something like a Fantome, but not as prominent.

Taste is both tart and sweet. And spicy and alcoholic. I taste a little honey, some grain, and some kind of odd hops - lets say tart floral. Mild dry spiciness. I taste no fruit, no candi. Medium to full body. Aftertaste of alcohol. Medium carbonation.

The flavors start with moderately sweet thick pale malt, some honey, some vineous notes and light spice.  The finish brings out the distinct Belgium traits - earthy yeast, barnyard and such.

I usually pour the beer before I smell it.  Apricot, banana, and watermelon.  Yes, I smelled it twice, there is watermelon in there.  Fizzy head was huge, but died off fast like a soda.

Mango, papaya, lime and lemon top notes, more tropical fruit and even some pineapple.  A touch of warming follows all of these bringing with it intense spices of cardamon, clove, and ginger.  Creamy texture with a lovely wheaty body and spiciness up front.  Fresh tropical fruit mingling with warm baking spices.  Ginger, clove, black pepper mingle with a soft spearmint flavour on the back.  Sweet Belgian malt bring the yeast and fruitiness together.  Warming intensifies the spice and softens the fruit.  Waves and waves of alternating sweet spice, tropical fruit and tart acidity just make this a world class example of the brewers art.  Amazing beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

3241,"2006-11-03",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Imagine all the oozing, corpulent zombies you like.  Envisage haunting specters roaming down hall ways to your hearts content.  Ruminate on swamp monsters, vampires, werewolves, scientific abominations and uncanny murders until you turn cold and clammy, but we all know that there is something supremely scarier than all these blood curling thoughts: the angry termagant, or as its known in the beer community, the Mad Bitch!  It was hardly a choice which beer would be most appropriate for Halloween night.  But its a sardonic beer on any occasion.  I distinctly recall a woman coming into a local wine shop and asking for a Joke beer, maybe something funny in the name.  Sure enough, Mad Bitch was suggested and, rather than take offense the woman seemed rather intrigued.  The label attempts to drill into the psychological core of womens rage but even its confusing colors and alarming visage fail to do justice to the great purging anger of the better sex.  The acrimonious words and bellicose saber rattling of a truly fearsome warrior of the XX clan simply cant be conveyed in image.  From the bottle issues forth a cloudy and richly colored beverage the hue of bees wax with a nigh uncontrollable whipped egg white head.  I had to pace the pour for about five minutes to fit the whole drink in my glass  uncontrollable!  The nose is far more charming, gracing the nose with pear, sour apple, butter, lemon, clove, red grapes, fresh mountains stream, and a hint of generic sourness.  With a little warmth this bouquet includes creamed honey, apricot, honey suckle and sweet yellow corn.  The taste abandons all this deceptively sweet charm and burdens itself with savory seriousness, committing itself to a heavy biscuit theme flanked by yeast and white bread tastes.  It is advised, then, that the Mad Bitch is enjoyed at a safe distance where the pleasing aroma can be appreciated and the coarse and mild mannered taste can be avoided.  If we are to survive the horror of horrors that is a womans scorn (Greater than or equal to Hells fury and all that) then we must learn to keep our distance and, in some cases, find a heavy obstacle to duck behind so that we may later enjoy the lighter side of the same idyllic angel who only yesterday was called the Mad Bitch!","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

There is good lacing on the sides of the glass as the head dies down.  Mouthfeel is fairly heavy.  You can tell that the fruity aspects are the main show here, mostly sweet up front with a grain presence following and then a little burst of sourness as the sip fades to a memory.  A little more unidimensional than I expected, though as the fruit flavors are definitely the feature.

3241,"2006-06-15",4.0,"Bottle. Its been a while since I had to stop pouring a brew because the head was so large it threatened to overflow. The head is so huge and so slow in disipating that Im not sure when Im going to actually be able to drink it. Very similar in aroma to the De Dolle Dulle Teve Special Reserva. From the description on the latter, I am deducing that the reason the Teve 10 is a little lighter in color is perhaps due to the fact it was not aged in the Calvados casks. But hold that, now that I am able to pour the rest of the bottle in, the sediment/yeast at the bottom of the bottle makes the body darker and very similar to the orange of the Special Reserva. Head is beautiful, cumulus cloud-like, enduringly lasting. This brew is supposed to be more lively in its carbonation, but Im not getting that. I really should have done a side-by-side, because my frame of comparison is spread over 24 hours. Its hard for me thus to tell much difference between the two brews. Sweet, Belgian candi-sugar. Im not as enamored with this brew as the Special Reserva, but its still darn good and very similar.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
3241,"2006-06-15",3.9,"I am no expert in advertising, but naming your beer ""Mad Bitch"" doesnt sound like a recipe for success. The recipe for this beer, however, need not change as it is an excellent example of the style and simply an excellent brew. The color reminds of Charentais melon, subtly clouded and topped of a superb creamy white head that recedes with equally dense lacing. Classic esters and grain form the cynosure of the nose, a wonderful combination of bubble gum, dried banana, raisins, mandarin, apple juice, cherries and peach yoghurt balanced by the rich sweetness of caramel, biscuits and honey. This enticing complexity is not as ebullient in the flavor as it relies more on a soft malt profile than the panache of fruits found in the aroma. Butterscotch and unctuous grains hide the relatively high alcohol content that is only reminded by the slightly burnt finish. I would love to try some older samples of this wonderful tripel.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3241,"2006-06-05",3.8,"Im a huge fan of tripels (maybe my favorite style). And I was pleased to import this for about $1 while travelling in Belgium. However, this one wasnt all I thought it was going to be initially (having been impressed by some other De Dolle selections). Poured with a humungous head. After the first pour into my Westvleteren glass, I waited five minutes, returned, and then poured.... still about 50ml in the bottle. So, I took an initial aroma whiff of the poured beer and then sipped away straight from the bottle. It was a bit ridiculous: harsh high abv presence with a rather bitter hoppy finish. So, I took the goblet and went to the family room. The carbonation was really high and the bubbles rather entertaining to watch as they rose up the amber-wheat colored (cloudy) beer to the pillowy REALLY big head (which was persistent). The aroma was vinous more than anything else, although not lacking some candy sugar. After another five minutes or so, the flavor was harsh, vinous, with a hoppy bitter finish - aggressive all the way around. Allowing it to warm, though, things got a lot better and the apples and citrus flavors came through with a rather nice yeasty and hoppy bitter finish. Still a little on the aggressive side for a tripel (and very thick mouthfeel), but a nice tripel. If youre sitting on one of these, let it sit for a few years, maybe things will work out even better for you.","","User37895"

The freshly grated peel mingles with pinches of dried ginger and the juice flows sweetly with raw sugar and perfume.

3241,"2006-03-18",4.5,"finally opened up the bottle jbrus sent me back in late 04. thanks john! useby sept 04 - so i guess that makes it 5 years old now. or 4 i dunno. anyway i was curious as to how tripels evolve. some of them seem too flimsy to survive the cellar but this one is robust enough in alcohol and body to work with the slight oxidation. beautiful to look at, a bright pale amber (like, the colour of amber itself rather than the colour of an ""amber ale"") with the most enormous creamy rocky head that sticks around forever. having only had the calvados-aged dulle teve before i was amazed that this one smells very similar - theres a definite apple ester in there. i guess thats why they aged it in calvados casks. brilliant. along with apple i got peach, crisp german hops, rich caramel and brown sugar, and dough and leather from the yeast. very complex and unique aroma. it shows its age once you taste it - the raisiny finger of Oxidation (the 5th horseman of the apocalypse) has tainted this beer. After a couple of sips I decided that this wasnt a bad thing, in fact it works well. all the bitterness that this beer must have had is gone, leaving a mellow, warm, very fruity and alcoholic and sweet beer. caramel and strawberries and sherry. but dry and with traces of herbal hops in the finish. a delicious tropical fruit tartness lingers. yummy, a powerful and hefty tripel that is a real tripel, caramelly and robust - nothing like the bush blond sort of souped up duvels that you get. i would love to try this fresh.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"

3241,"2006-02-27",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2011 Bottle at The Kulminator, Antwerp.  Not sure what year this one was but the label said bottled in 07/96.  Cloudy gold colour.  Lovely caramel aroma.  Sweetish in mouth.  Just an unbelievable beer.  Raisins/sultanas.  Slightly musty. Some plastic/rubber aroma.  Bizarre, but hops are superb.  Bottle a more up to date bottle, so will re-rate later.  Re-rate.  As one of the beers that puts me in a completely different state of mind, the best beer to do that.  Takes me on a journey no other beer can.  Truly frightening, but also a beer I really adore. Re-rate 3/1/10.  Bottle I had been keeping for a couple of years in a box and then decided to open as hops go off??  But its a freakin Tripel you idiot!!!  But yes, it has improved definitely with Im guessing here 2-3 years age at least.  Poured into an Oerbier glass without getting any of the yeast in the glass, then decanted into a De Molen tasting glass.  Golden orange with a slight hae and lasting off white head.  Aroma of jellied fruits like orange, tangerine and lime.  But also some puke as well, which I have to admit I dont mind on this.  Some esters delivering vanilla and over-ripe banana.  Keeps the carbonation and condition remarkably well given the age and the decanting.  Very firm in the mouth, somewhere between silky and syrupy.  Flavours on the swallow have some pepper and herb and the finish has some definite hop bite.  Blow me!! this is an exceptional beer.  Some residual puke flavour does run through it.  Which is why I think it is a special beer.  It has a bunch of faults, but there are some amazing flavours and aromas and it makes me FEEL different to any other beer.  The mouthfeel and swallow are sublime, almost perfect and this pepper and slight heat on the end with expanding jellied tangerine and lime are just totally wonderful.  A once in a lifetime beer that Ive had several times.  Must buy more.  It is fabulous.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

At this point I will quit being a ratebeer geek and start rating like the true Dermite that I am. Mafuckers keep talkin bout floaties in their wack ass ratings but I aint tryin to hear that shit. This mafucker looks just like Hoegaarden or something. This sumbitch has a head that looks like a big fluffy white pillow or your mommas cellulite ridden ass if the wrinkles were replaced with bubbles. Ima keep it real wicha man. This bastard smelled like my armpits after I finished moving like eight kegs at work at first. But I got over that because Im used to the smell of my armpits. Eventually this beer reminded me of that yella rock candy I used to get at the North Cackalack Museum of Life N Science. You know, the one that was artificial banana flavored. Except this one had thyme in it or something.  So I got tired of smelling this shit and decided it was time to get all kinds of bamboozled off the drank. Definitely a tripel. All kinds of banana flavors with a bit of citrus tang and rhubarb. The yeast is ever present and your mother never liked you. I enjoyed the hell out of this beer and I enjoyed rating it. Ive dealt with many mad bitches in my day and if all of them would have been this easy to deal with Id open my own Mad Bitch sanctuary. Unfortunately, this beer has a misleading name. I would have named it the Flemish equivalent of Fuck Buddy and left it at that. Nahmeanson??!!??!!? This mafucker aint so pretty on the palate. Rough on your tongue and it coats your mouth with a syrupy film. But I would be goddamned if I didnt go back to this one from time to time until it got too expensive to take on more dates.

Anyway, this was a beautiful pour.  Great head of tiny bubbles with a lot of tiny floaties in there.  At first, the aroma was very yeasty and musty, but it got very sweet about mid-bottle with light fruit (mostly banana) and candy sugar.  By the end of the bottle, it really smelled like vanilla frosting.  At first, the mouthfeel was very sweet and fruity, like the aroma.  A very slight alcohol burn appeared midbottle, but disappeared quickly and was replaced with vanilla and candy sugars.  Gets exponentially drier as it warmed to room temp.  Finishes sweet and dry.  All in all its a top shelf tripel, and I really cant decide if if its better after the barrel aging.

Poured into a 50cL chalice at around 10°C after a good year in the cellar. Head rose from the pour, another lively De Dolle, and with the 33cL bottle size it still filled the glass with head and rose a good inch from out its brim. Floaties were in abundance, like pulped oranges and spent hop buds, amid a hazy and almost opaque orangey gold body. Disappointingly subtle in the aroma (most of the action seemed to go into the head). Soft apple and cinnamon nose with a little pepper and doughy yeast. It smelt like apple crumble dessert. Quite sweet, smooth and creamy in the mouth. Toffee and toasted malt seemed to dominate the palate, with some bready yeast and a late hit of soft citric fruits like cantaloupe and grapefruit, before a warming and smooth toffee malt swallow. The alcohol, for its strength, was beautifully controlled especially with its silky and full mouthfeel. A lot more simple than I expected. I love a good Tripel and this just laued in that dividing line of style. Lovely, without definition. (33cL, age unknown, Intl Beer Shop, W. Leederville)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Powerful, broad taste of bread, coriander, yeast with quite a bit of alcohol heat and a good deal of bitterness at the end. The bitterness is mostly overpowered by the taste, however.

I can pick out some pepper. Apart from the spices, its bready, yeasty, and a little salty. The spiciness is in the flavor (especially the pepper, which comes through clearly in the finish). Theres a little bit of funk, some wood, a lambic-like sourness, and a surprising dose of hops at the end. Unlike any Tripel Ive tried before.

The taste is shocking with its sour tang and bready overtones with a dash of pepper, clove, and cardmom on the finish. Woody and earthy characteristics are found within as well but I am in the minority here but I enjoyed the Reserva flavors and complexity more than what I found here. This is too twangy for a Tripel IMO. The feel is quite light considering the ABV and style.

Perfumey hops sprits the palate, closely followed by doughy biscuits, mute bananas, cornmeal, pepper and coriander.  Some datylic alcohol amidst the malty muskiness, but the prevailing verbose sweetness is right up my alley and perfect for where I think a tripel should be.

3241,"2005-08-28",3.9,"The chilled and gently handled bottle foamed over immediately upon opening. It poured an apricot colored cloudy beer with an ample rocky white head that dissipated quickly and settled to a nice small, thick foam that lasted throughout and left nice lacing on the glass. There were wonderfully rich aromas that presented themselves with significant notes of clove and orange. It had a medium body with significant carbonation and a slightly dry texture. The complex flavors began with a big fruity sweetness. As the flavor matured, some hop bitterness began to balance the malt sweetness and it began to dry out. The finish is quite long with a slight sweet dryness about it. The high alcohol content brings a lasting warmth to the finish as well.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"

Lots of sweet yeasty notes that they do oh so well and some glorious hops with a fine malty backbone. Assertive as hell in mouth with lots of peppery spice, gorgeous sugary yeast and a very slight hint of that characteristic De Dolle sourness.

3241,"2005-04-09",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2005 750ml bottle. The bottle is several years old and the liquor store was reluctant to sell it to me because they thought it was heat damaged. I have read there were some leakage problems with these bottles and the area around the cap does look bad, it is crusty and nasty. I popped the cap (no cork) and was greeted by some carbonation. I wiped of the gunk around where the cap was and I poured a glassful into my duvel tulip. There was plenty of carbonation; in fact I got an inch or two of a pretty, white head. I had refrigerated the beer for several hours today and I let it sit and warm, unopened, for a while. The temp at pouring was a touch over 50°. Really nice aroma of honey and yeast. The taste told me that this beer was still good, in fact very good. There is an initial spicy fruitiness. It is peppery and a bit sour. There is also a honey flavor and some mild estery notes. There is a nice depth of flavor and it does seem to evolve as you drink the bottle. The alcohol is apparent, but not over the top. The beer has a very full body. I consider myself very fortunate to have found a 750ml of this and I still have half the bottle left to enjoy. ADDITION: As the beer warms, its flavor changes more and more. The beer at 59° reminds me, initially, of a Victory Hop Devil, inasmuch as it is very honey-like, but not at all cloying. I am not sure if it is the hops or the alcohol, but that was what I was thinking as I was drinking it. The spice seems to now hold off until the finish. The start is fruity malt with yeast and ester (orange and banana notes) and the finish is dry and spicy. I am starting to feel the alcohol. I wonder, since this is a live beer, if the alcohol might be higher than the 10% that is listed, I mean it is possible and other beers are that way. On another note, when I poured out the last half of the bottle, the sedimentation became obvious, in fact it poured out of the bottle at the end and I stopped pouring when I saw the color of the beer change. The taste is no different than the first half, but I do detect some more perfumy notes in the initial taste. There is still the honeyish malt, but it is complimented by a floral? and fruity taste that carries onto the finish. The commercial description is accurate, there is a taste-evolution as I drink it, in fact I dont think it would have been as noticeable if I was drinking a regular 33cl bottle. This has been an incredibly enjoyable beer. I added a few points to my initial review. I had to pushed up the appearance, aroma, and  palate up a point each and the overall a point, to 18.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Hell, I was in love before I even opened the bottle.  Body is cool and perfectly carbonated, only slightly coating, happily yielding to the aggressive hop finish.  The flavors are a floral hoppy boquet, tons of orange and lemon, maybe some pineapple.  Sweet toffee notes surprise my buds just as a warming alcohol presence sweeps over the whole show.

Tasted pretty much like the aroma and then my eyes went wide as the ""Mad Bitch"" dida lunatic dance on my tongue with stilletoe heels. WHOA!,SHIT! I wasnt expecting that.

The shock of new, once again, sends a shudder through me, a paraxysm of delight...Im left uttering epithets and interjections...what kind of incredible concoction is this, that leads with hot peppers on the tongue, followed by lush fruitiness, backed up by serious malt! A devilish delivery of hops, followed quick by that spicy kick, almost harsh, but not quite, for its so adequately complimented by further flavors. It may seem like a messy marriage, this union of hops, spice and fruit, with the more powerful flavors fully in charge of the palate, but it instead stands out as an immaculate integration, a wanton wedding that provides release as well as relief. Taboos are uncovered, old rituals discarded, and something completely un-thought-of starts to seem commonplace...this is a moment where whats in the glass wends its way into your soul, by tasting the brew it becomes you, and now, youre that damnable dame! It seriously clings to you, never wants to leave the palate, doesnt take no for an answer, your brain says ""no more"", but your newly freed secret-self yens to stretch out some...""whats the harm?""

3241,"2004-09-02",4.0,"Opening the bottle involved two tools of the trade: bottle opener and corkscrew. Even after the cap was liberated, the beast was screaming to get out -- attempting to burst through the cork. Once unleashed, foam proceeded to erupt. In short, she needed some time to process the situation before allowing me to indulge. Appearance: explosive effervescence, and an enormous bright white head -- diminishing with time leaving a clingy lace and a good film to lock in the flavor. The color was golden; hazy with lots of carbonation rising to the top. The aroma is of bubblegum (strong), fruity fresh and very full. Taste is full, sweet, with a spicy biting middle and a dry finish (quite complex); the bitterness ligers well into the next taste. Mouth feel is medium bodied, syrupy, and effervescent. The transition from sweet to dry is intensified by its intense bitter characteristics

Flavors ensue from the aroma with a wonderful array of caramel with a nice underlay of lemon hints and mildly exhibited spice. Perfect amount of heat and grab in its alcohol and sharpness. Maintains its overall semi-tropical fruity malting with caramel and sugars while a crisp little return of spicy hops and yeast dart through the finish where it has a sweeping sweetness that goes dry and peppery after a stint.

Feel is briskly malty with a fruity/caramel backing and fullness the whole ride through, fluffy distribution across the palate at first, finely carbonated, and lots of other fun things inside that include some light and mild spices, some alcoholic heat, and a super jovial finish that goes from fruity sweet and sugary to dry, hoppy, spicy, and yeasty.

The flavor is neither too sweet nor too dry, with pineapple and orange notes delivering just enough citrus character to the otherwise dry, crackery, spicy, very estery body.  Bitter finish with detectable alcohol.  Tight carbonation leaves a nice mouthfeel.  A bit rougher around the edges than some Tripels I've tried, but the main drawback is the steep price (I believe I paid $11.99/bottle).

The beer pours a hazy orange-gold color, and produces a prodigious white head.  There is a lightly dusty, herbal, floral, and grassy aroma to this beer.  It is sharp and herbal in taste, and is very well carbonated.  It is lightly sweet with notes of honey and spices.  It is almost spicy hot in character, quite interesting actually.  This beer is definitely musty in character, it is like it has been lightly dusted with some pollen from a slightly astringent, yet floral flower.  It is slightly lemony in character, with a hint of apple to it as well.  The beer gets a bit sweeter as the copious amounts of carbonation starts to dissappear.  There is also a nuttiness here in the middle of the beer, which adds to the complexity.  I really like the interplay between the spiciness and the fruity sweetness, a very good balance that melds into an incrediple beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

(Bottled) Dark orange color with a medium, tight and creamy head. Extremely fruity, very crisply spicy-anisey aroma with salmiac and sour cream. Slightly sugary, very fruity anise flavor with berries and some alcohol burn in the finish. The ABV is quite well hidden, though. Medium to full-bodied, smooth, although moderately high-carbonated and refreshing palate. A very enjoyable and tasty, mouth-blowing tripel.

Fairly carbonated body, and the alcohol is masked quite well.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
3241,"2003-03-14",3.9,"Blond beer with a big head. Citrusy and spicy aroma and taste. Sweet full start with a bitter sharp finish. The alcohol presence is strong but in no way disturbing. A very nice, tasty strong beer.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
3241,"2003-02-23",4.1,"Wow, the cork just popped on this one after I took the cap off. She really must be mad. The head flowing out of it needed time to work down. After it calmed down, I was able to pour a cloudy gold beer with a nice bubbly white head that left some circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. There should've been, the way the cork exploded off. It had an aroma of citrus, clove and other spices. The flavor was of clove, a touch of anise with a slight smokiness and hint of the alcohol to it. The finish was a touch astrigent with elements of the smokiness. With the alcohol level present, this bitch could definately slap you silly.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
3241,"2003-02-21",4.2,"This is a great ale.  Poured thick and foamy.  Flavor is spicy, bitter, and citrusy.  Finished dry, bitter, and alcohol warming.  Recommended.","New Jersey, USA","beerslayer"
3241,"2003-02-20",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2005 What a fun beer!  Tart green apple, green banana, and fresh bread dough aroma.  Full foamy head with dull copper color.  Tart and tantalizing with apple, bready and yeasty flavors.  Dry, sharp finish.  Warming alcohol in the chest.  Immediately intoxicating and heady - somewhat fuselly, my head is swimming!  Otherwise quite nice, although a little hard to finish a whole 750 by yourself.  Final note: not overly foamy at all, didnt lose a drop - head was large but not over-sized.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
3241,"2003-02-15",2.9,"First off, this beer is a damn ripoff because half of the expensive bottle will wind up down the drain as foam.  Believe everything you read about it.  Even the girl behind the counter told me this.  This is why this beer is getting a 1 for appearance from me.  On the other hand, it smells great, if you like the smell of baking bread.  As soon as I opened it, the whole room smelled of bread and people started asking about the beer.  But the flavor is just above average.  I never thought that one beer could rate a 10 for aroma and a 1 for appearance...  But I'll never buy this again, if I was in Belgium I would go to the brewery and get half of my money back.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
3241,"2003-02-15",3.7,"I let this one sit in the sink and foam for awhile.  For all the carbonation involved (i was burbing like a mad man), it was a very smooth drink.  Sweet, citrus, yeasty, bitter at the finish.  This was very different - I liked it but some of it was hard to describe.  Stronger than I thought, too - the alc really snuck up on me.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

3241,"2003-01-21",3.7,"Spicy, tripel-eaue aroma...flavor is spicy/grassy. Strong alcohol flavor present in the finish. Long, bitter aftertaste. The balance gets smoother as it warms, but overall the alcohol seems to overpower the present malt throughout.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

Hmmm...sour and yeasty (just like the rest of De Dolle beers) but suprisingly not to my liking.  Maybe it was the foam orgy that had just taken place and caught me off gaurd, I dont know.  All I can tell is I probably will not be buying this again.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
3241,"2003-01-06",4.2,"Vanilla and bananas in the nose. Attractive brew: hazy gold color and a huge foamy head. Citrusy, orangy tastes blended well with a strong yeast component. Rough and dirty palate - very assertive, but oh so good.","GERMANY","pivo"
3241,"2003-01-03",3.7,"Golden to bronze in color with big, but diminishing, head.  The aroma is interesting, but not all that amazing or different.  The flavor, however, is perhaps the hardest to pin down that I have yet to encounter.  Sweet, spicy, a touch bitter, with citrus, tart and alcohol warm.  It got ten times better as it warmed.  Intriguing.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3241,"2003-01-01",4.0,"Big yeasty head.  Another wacky beer from De Dolle.  Make sure you let this one warm up a bit- it improves dramatically.  Lots of citrusy notes.  Reminds me a bit of Vuuve.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","booyaatribe"

I like triples to be spicy actually, as the delirium tremens, guillotine and even the Hertog Jan triple. But this one, is really special. Very complex taste, so complex you do not notice the 10 % ABV. Long lingering palate, delicious palate! Excellent triple!","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"

Body is hazy medium yellow, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain, caramel), moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), moderately yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of candied pineapple, candy sugar, pepper, and alcohol. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Some batches are more like a tripel, some more just a sweet, strong golden...but this ones always tasty.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3241,"2002-07-01",4.2,"Faint hazy amber with huge rocky island lasting creamy head. My bottle did not appear to have anywhere near the amount of yeast flakes or lumps such as other raters have reported. I think that this beer has the fruitiest aroma of any of the beers I have rated so far - it reminds me a lot of Duvel. Aromas include passion fruit, pineapple and loads of peach, some bitter hops, spices and stale cured meat and old wine cork yeast . The body is beautiful, big and bold, the mouth fills quickly with a quick burst of all the aroma fruits plus spices, liquorice and coffee. Then the bitter and warming alcohol kick in quite nicely in the middle followed by a a long bitter finish stretching to a a yeasty dry after taste. At times this beer and all that alcohol seem some what raw - kinda like a work in progress but it is still very intruiguing and  one definitely worth trying. If you like Duvel and yeast you will probably like this one. In Belgium the 330cc bottle in Belgium costs  ~$1.40 - man is that good value!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"
3241,"2002-06-21",3.8,"Remember when you poured too much soap in the washer at the coin laundry? Pouring this beer is a real trial w. the head that will not stop and even after dying down it coats the glass like a milk shake. The appearance, other than the head is a nice orangey, very active cloudy brew. Flavor/aroma are reminiscent of the Duvel school of strong golden ales, very spicy w. a licorice/candy sugar accent. I still havent finished pouring and Im not so sure what Ill do w. the yeast and sediment. Maybe pour it in a slug trap in my back yard (gardeners know what Im talkin about).  Alcohol burn is way too prominent, but subsides as the beer warms. I love De Dolle and fans of Belgians should check out any De Dolle they can find.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"
3241,"2002-06-08",3.9,"750ml. Semi hazy straw/light peach. Tons of yeasty flakes swirling around. Massively thick, foamy and alive (looks like its moving) off white head. Monstrous big bubbled carbonation that causes an inversion of liquid and flakes. Spicy aroma, lemony hops, candied sugar, farmy aspects and cat pee. Lightly spritzy, spicy, lemony, musty with a huge rocket fuel-esque alcohol punch. Lightly tart and dryish with a juicy hop and alcohol ester mix. Although a bit much alcohol taste at times. Light to medium bodied. Nicely spiced altough some may find it overbearing. Dry and spicy aftertaste with loads of yeast notes and estery alcohol. Turns bone dry at mid bottle. Tremendous yeast pour further clouds this, and adds what looks like a pile of salmon eggs to the bottom of the glass. Adds some depth of body and a slight increase in tartness. Tries to mellow out the alcohol. Also adds a light flowery sweet thickness to the body as well. Finishes better balanced with all the wacky flavors going on. Very unique and very busy, like a super charged Saison.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"

3241,"2002-03-11",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2003 I have never been scared of a beer...until now. This thing is freakin' me out just looking at it. First off, it is the single most cloudy, unpasteurized beer I've ever seen. The huge amount of dregs I could barely make out through the thick green champagne bottle glass made me wonder if it had gone bad (I don't think so...), and were creepy enough, but the label (mine is a bit different than pictured) sealed the deal. I'm goin' to the devil. This brew piles everything in to such an extent it boggles the mind: the sheer volume of yeast makes it like a high school biology experiment gone awry, hop oil literally drips down the sides of the tulip glass and my tongue, it is mildy sweet with a strong lemony malt type of taste, mixed with orange rind. Bitter hop blasts throughout the tasting session come wave after wave. Bizarre, challenging, and probably the most nutritious beer I'll ever drink.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

Murky dark yellow, lively rich head. Grassy hops up front. Sweet and full bodied with soft, rounded mouthfeel. Pepper and tar strikes, and then gentle toffee takes over until the grassy bitter finsih. Rich and complex.

3241,"2002-01-11",4.4,"The Mad Bitch here is a long breather. Ive given her about 15 minutes with a slight crack in the cap and it hissed and bubbled the whole time. The first pour was mostly all white foam and post-pour, the beer had to be re-capped and de-gassed slowly again over two minutes time. After the wait, the very lightly golden foam settles over a good looking, lightly cloudy radiant orange brew. The aroma is killer, its Wit Bieresque with slight hints of bandage or plastic and very pure alcohols. Oh man, this is nice. Very creamy -- silky smooth. Clear neroli and alcohol flavors, punches the gut with alcohol, semi-dry. I cant believe theres any more sugar in this after being bottled so long and having taken on so much CO2. Very tangy. The citrus flavors blend very well with the strong alcohol and heathery hop characteristics. At $11 per bottle, its a splurge but for me it was quite worth it.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"

3241,"2001-10-09",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2003 I have to say that this is some horribly done bottle art.  I'm pretty sure just about anyone could have managed better, including most children.  Anyway, this beer hides its 10% alcohol content well behind a mask of complex fruity, tart, bitter, yeasty, malty and fruity flavors.  Aroma is very estery, with the yeast and hops being dominant, and notes of pear, tangerine, white grape and melon.  Very nice, almost over-generous head and carbonation.  Peppery, spicy finish.  Hazy golden yellow color.  Quite an interesting beer.  This stuff just screams 'I'm Belgian!'","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
