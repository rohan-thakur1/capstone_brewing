2830,"2017-06-09",3.8,"On tap at a restaurant. Great crisp, slightly creamy full bodied yet clean lager. Slightly bitter, just enough to cleanse the palate. Rich barley flavor. Really fresh tasting. Outstanding Lager.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
2830,"2017-02-20",3.5,"On tap at the Local Option bar, and served to a footed, Prima stange showing a clear golden hue, with a fluffy layer of white froth, and web-like lacing. The nose was lightly floral, a hint of fruitiness, soft grain, light corn, and subtle sweetness. Light to medium bodied, the carbonation was lively, as the taste was altogether crisp & clean, with some moderate tartness & tanginess. A refreshing Pils.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

2830,"2016-05-04",3.4,"Golden pour with a huge single finger head. Lace present. Aroma is flowery and light. Finishes dry. Taste is flowery and very flavorful. Very clean and easy drinking. Light bodied. A little grain in the taste as well. A solid Pilsener.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dinkle50"
2830,"2016-02-26",4.4,"American lagers that are true lagers/pilsners are all too rare. Either the Brewer amps up the hops too much, uses the wrong hops, or the mouthfeel/finish are so thin it barely qualifies as a beer. The Outlawger is exactly what you want out of a Pilsner: it's clean, easy to drink, and so simple you might foolishly underestimate the skill it takes to make. Highly recommended.

2830,"2016-01-04",3.9,"Tap. Pours clear with a large creamy white head, colors in doubt cause of the red lights in local option. Aroma is grassy, biscuit, grain, floral. Flavor is very light sweet, light bitter, simple grassy with a hint of citrus and biscuit. Rich and creamy without graininess. Light body. Great lawnmower beer. Possibly my favorite straight pils.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2830,"2015-12-09",3.9,"Pours a slightly hazy, pale golden yellow color with clear straw colored edges and a two finger white head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Excellent retention with a pillowy cap that slowly fades, coating the glass with large streaks of soapy lacing. A little light but otherwise pretty nice looking.

Crisp floral hop aroma with grassy saaz, pine and subtle resins countered by light fruit esters, bread, straw and hay. Pilsner malt sweetness with bread, biscuit and apple and pear sweetness. Nice complexity with a very pleasant grassy hop presence followed by pilsner malt and sweet fruit. Smells really good.

Lighter end of medium body. Clean, crisp and refreshing with a grassy hop bite that lingers over the pale malt and sweet fruit notes into a slightly sweet, dry finish. Grassy saaz hop bitterness with hay, straw and subtle resins quickly countered by bread, biscuit, cracker and apple and pear eatery sweetness. Really well balanced and very easy to drink making this an extremely sessionable American interpretation of the style. Excellent hop presence nicely balanced by the malt and esters with out being overly sweet or funky. Very nice.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
2830,"2015-11-27",3.7,"On tap at Local Option. Pours a faintly hazed gold with a medium to large sized white head. Dusty grain and crisp crackers on the nose. Medium bodied, crisp with some sweet biscuit and cracker notes. Moves to a fairly crisp finish with some lingering sweetness and a hint of grainy bitterness. Easy drinking on a hot summer day. Or at least, the walk here from Wrigley after the game was fairly hot.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2830,"2015-08-21",4.2,"Bottle from Santa. Gorgeous hazy yellow pour with a frothy white head. Stuck around and left some good lace. Aroma was big herbal, grassy hops with a touch of lemon and cereal malts. 100% spot on. Flavors followed suit with the grassy hop character, mild pale malts, slight bitterness that lingered a bit. Smooth mouthfeel with plus carbonation. Super fresh nose and taste. We get some Local Option stuff but havent seen this one yet. If Its around this may become a frequent purchase. Awesome stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
2830,"2015-06-17",4.2,"Bottle pours a semi-hazy straw yellow with a large foamy white head. Bready earthy yeast aroma, with spicy grassy hops, very inviting! Flavor is lighter than the aroma lets on, mild bready yeast and grain encompass a nice bitter hit of spicy grassy hops. This pils is about as pleasant and fresh as they come. One of the best if not best German style American made pilseners, Ive had. Refreshing, well balanced, tasty, and extremely drinkable!! Ill be buying this often.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
2830,"2015-04-18",3.3,"Pretty good for a pilsener. Lots of nice noble hops. Pours golden with good head. Crisp bitter finish. Tap at brewpub.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"

2830,"2014-09-10",3.9,"500ml bottle. Hazy yellow-tan body. Big, foamy white head. Lots of active rising carbonation bubbles within. Another well done Lager from Local Option. Not really perfect to style, has some Zwickel tones, more of a country Lager? Earthy brewhouse aroma, some lemony Noble hops. Medium bodied, easy drinking, but very well executed, nice depth. Fresher than most US sold German beer, and probably better ingredients over all. Good stuff.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
2830,"2014-09-10",3.4,"One of the better of this style I have had. Fruity banana and dry flavors. Mild malts and hops. Doesn't have the German bite I am used to on this type. Good beer","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"

2830,"2014-08-23",3.0,"Solid pilsner style lager. Light yellow in color with a fizz heavy carbonation. Nose is skunky. Bready with a very European accent. Not bad, less acrid and acidic as most continental style lagers. Well made for the style and well suited for day drinking.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Barnoloid"
2830,"2014-08-19",3.6,"Tap @ Local Option: Moderately cloudy, golden haze with a long lasting, frothy, bone-white head that leaves lots of chunk lacing behind. Aroma of dried sweetbread, grainy & buttered biscuits, pale malt, fresh dough, clean lager yeast, faint floral zest, & just a touch of mineral water. Fresh, inviting, very nice for the style. More of the same on the palate with a big wave of fresh pilsner malt washing over your senses. Grains, bread, biscuits, doughy malt, a moderate citrus spritz towards the back-end, & some clumpy lager yeast in the finish. Hops are more forward & balancing on the palate with a little zing to them, a touch spicy & earthy, seemingly of the Noble variety? A very enjoyable & quaffable beer; a nice example of the style, too.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
2830,"2014-08-03",3.3,"500mL bottle. Pours a pale gold color, medium white head with phenomenal retention and lacing. Nose is grains, malt, grain, mild skunk (what do you expect from a traditionally brewed and hopped style that typified American beer before the craft/micro brew explosion took over?) . Mouth is exactly what the nose suggests: a lot of cereal, very mild bitterness, clean finish (i.e. a very straightforward Pilsener). As Ive gotten older Ive expanded my horizons and moved on from the Pilsener/Premium Lager style that was basically all that youd find in the US 30+ years ago, but as a Midwesterner by birth and residence, I grew up on beers like this one... however, Local Option isnt trying to keep up with the Anheuser-Buschs, Pabsts or Millers of the world (thank God!)and this one is a bit better than the aforementioned .","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
2830,"2014-07-25",4.6,"Consumed several pints of this wonderful light lager at Green Street Smoked Meats on another recent trip to Chicago. 

This light lager pours beautiful pale with a sturdy, persistent white head. Immediate notes of freshly baked bread, biscuits, slight malt sweetness and spice are forward while grassy and floral attributes follow. No alcohol presence detected. Bartender said this beer was lagered for 2 months and unfiltered, which I suppose is why there is a slight haze on the appearance. Id drink my weight in this beer.","USA","oeltroll"
2830,"2014-07-23",4.1,"Pours a slightly hazy light golden with a nice white head that settles to a ring with a spotty film on top. Aroma of white bread and floral hops. Taste is bready malt with a little honey sweetness. Herbaceous Noble hops and a hint of lemon rind with a nice minerality and mild bitterness in the finish. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and moderate/high carbonation. A very good and easy drinking pilsener. The light, clean flavors invite you to take sip after sip.","Missouri, USA","jeremyh70"
2830,"2014-07-16",3.6,"500 ml bottle. Pours a slight hazed golden with a medium white head. Aroma of floral and baked bread notes. Mild yeast. Flavor is really nice. Balanced, with fresh baked bread sweetness and noble hop bitterness. Medium bodied, finishes long and hoppy. This is pretty wonderful. Put this in a six pack of cans and lets enjoy summer.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
2830,"2014-06-26",4.3,"I wish they made this stuff in six packs rather than 50 cL singles but whatever, it is an great beer. It pours a slightly hazed yellow golden w/ a long-lasting head of medium bubbles, which leaves behind sloppy splotches of lace. The nose on this is great, a solid but subtle batch of honey floral notes from noble hops and just a hint of baked yeast bread. This is nice and dry, medium bodied but not heavy. It gets maltier as you dig into it, just a straight-up Grape-Nuts malted barley character, which helps bring out a lemon not from the hops in the mildly bitter finish. This is very definitely one of the best lagers brewed in the US. It has a subtle complexity that seems to shift w/ each sip with its carbonation that starts sharp and grows softer w/ each sip. This is my kind of beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2830,"2014-06-09",4.0,"500mL bottle poured into Hovels tall think mug. Nice clear yellow color with some bubbles shooting up the body. Small but strong head. Aroma is moderate noble hops. Clean biscuit maltiness, just a little thicker and slightly more syrupy than I would love. Body is light but soft but felt. The lingering carbonation lasts through the flavor and eases into the end of the aftertaste. There is a bit of stickiness on the cheeks. Flavor is again nice with that noble hop flavor. White bread malts are just a bit sticky. Generally, very nice. This maybe a bit higher rated cause I havent had a good pils in a while. Its good just needs a bit more brightness and a little less sweet and sticky (not that its a lot).","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2830,"2014-04-10",3.1,"[Tap] Draught at Farmhouse in Evanston. Bright golden color with a high carbonation level. Crisp light malt and grass aroma. Taste is more of the same. Light vegetal and wet grass notes in the finish.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
2830,"2014-04-04",4.1,"On tap at Local Option in Chicago. Pour is brilliantly clear and light golden with a quickly dissipating white head that leaves a lot of nice lacing. Aroma is sweet German pils through and through. Taste is immaculately in line with a classic pils, perfect amount of sweet malt and clean noble hop finish. Amazingly good pils!

2830,"2012-05-10",3.9,"Tap at the brewery.  Syrupy golden pour that looks like mead in the glass.  Foamy white head that thins quickly.  Butter and carmel popcorn nose. Strong butter aroma.  Clean in the mouth, very cleansing.  Minimal hop presence at first and then a good burst of Euro hops.  The buttery malt flavors return at the end but arent as big as the hops.  Oily in the mouth for the style.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"
