1236,"2015-04-29",3.9,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/27/2014. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, brown bread, bourbon, light nuttiness, light chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and moderate bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, brown bread, bourbon, light nuttiness, light chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light herbal bitterness and oak/bourbon spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, vanilla, oak, brown bread, bourbon, light nuttiness/chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and moderate bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish.  Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present.  Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a very nice barrel aged doppelbock style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and moderate bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

1236,"2014-12-14",4.6,"A beautiful very dark brown beer, with reddish hilights in the light. Almost zero head. 
The bourbon barrel aging is very prevalent on the nose. Also getting raisins, fig newtons, and molasses. A viscous mouth feel.
The tastes are identical, with maybe the addition of some light brown sugar dusting to the whole affair. Getting some plum too as it warms, and very subtle vanilla. Definitely swings the way of malts, 
rather than hops.
This is a runaway winner for my favourite Camerons beer.","","Randy4Beer"

1236,"2012-12-05",3.8,"341ml bottle. Very dark reddish brown pour, unfiltered, almost black, medium brown head. Dark sweet raisin malt with hints of vanilla, alcohol and bourbon. Wood comes through more in the taste with some earth, pepper and coco, but the taste is a bit more thin than I expected. Body is quite light for the strength. Overall, not everything I was hoping for, but still a very enjoyable beer.","Saint John, New Brunswick, CANADA","HeistAlmighty"
1236,"2012-11-23",3.5,"Bottle [341ml] c/o GregClow. Pours a very deep ruby-brow with an average size semi-lasting frothy beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, bourbon and wood first followed by caramel malt and vanilla (7-). Flavour: Funnily enough, im the opposite of GregClow below me, I found the barrel-aging aspect of it pretty well balanced with the beer and not too overdone, more so then in the aroma. Nice balance of bourbon, vanilla and wood along with caramel malt, dark fruit and just a hint of coffee (7+). Average bodied. Not much carbonation. An enjoyable barrel-aged beer, well done.

1236,"2012-11-16",3.4,"Bottle from the brewery. Dark and clear ruby-brown with very little head. Aroma has a fair bit of wood and whiskey, but its pretty well integrated with the dark rye and licorice notes of the base beer. Soft body with pretty low carbonation - lower than I recall the original beer being, so Im guessing some was lost during aging. Flavour isnt quite as well balanced as the aroma - the charred oak and boozy whiskey notes from the barrel aging fight a bit with the roasted malt, coffee and cocoa notes of the original beer - but its still quite respectable, and mostly redeemed by a pleasant vanilla-toffee finish.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
