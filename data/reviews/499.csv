499,"2017-05-13",3.8,"Vintage 12. Thanks to Matt for this awesome brew! Partagée en compagnie de Marc-André. Robe pourpre tel un vin que le temps a oublié au fond dune cave. Une mousse à la framboise sur laquelle on a versé un coulis au chocolat. Du pépin de framboises presque acidulé et suret accompagné dun corps riche et trapu. Beaucoup dalcool en sentend malgré laquelle le tout se boit dangereusement bien, tant quon ne cherche pas à le boire comme une bière. Il faut appréhender le verre à la manière dun digestif. On ne boit que très rarement des breuvages qui se rapprochent de ceci.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

499,"2017-03-23",3.1,"Bottle from Clint (starcross) -- thanks a ton, buddy! This is substantially harsher than I was expecting. The raspberry flavor and aroma is readily apparent, but its surprisingly medicinal, to the point of smelling and tasting artificial. The malt base is hot, giving off booze and intense caramel sweetness. I shared this with about 6 employees of a local brewery, and it was a struggle to finish it.

Minimal lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge tart/juicy raspberries, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, red wine, toasted brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, cocoa, wood, and yeast/toasted earthiness.

499,"2015-02-06",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2015 Tap @ Kuhnhenn: 2013 vintage. Rich ruby red color with a tawny brown centers; a thick, creamy, fine-bubbled beige head settles into a foamy collar after just a couple moments. Aroma is a chocolate covered raspberry dessert onslaught. Bursting with super-sweet & ever so slightly tart raspberry jam & raspberry compote, with underscores of dense bakers chocolate, red grape, & a robust boozy presence. Very fresh, inviting, decadent, & dessert-like. Flavor is no different. Huge river of raspberry puree & raspberry preserves sliding across the palate on a board of dark chocolate & booze. Tastes like a raspberry jam filled chocolate cake. Only, dipped in a big vat of booze before being served. Its heavy & robust, but given that its somewhere between 13-16% ABV, a little heat is to be expected. Given the ABV, its actually pretty ""easy"" drinking. Often served in small samples, which is perfect. A lovely beer to pair with dessert. Or an evening full of regrettable decisions. Your call.
2007 vintage: Slightly more tart & a little bit thinner. Less of a chocolate presence. Not as decadent. A little more sherry-esque booze to this one, possibly from mild oxidation? Overall still a great beer but fresher is better.
2014 vintage: Opposite of the 07 vintage, this one has much more chocolate to it. Makes me think of those Tootsie Pops. The raspberry flavored one, of course. Booze is truncated nicely, yet still provides some warmth so you dont slam this high gravity eisbock like a fucken idiot. Really nice release this year.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

A: So red it has nearly turned black. No head, almost looks flat - though there was a rise before the fall there. Leggy.

N: Enormous raspberry, and a hint of fruit-rollup. Cherry undertones. Port wine, leather, tobacco, and sugar laden grapes. Tootsie rolls show up in force. Complex and inviting. At least, I think so.

T: Big tootsie roll sweetness. Gigantic raspberry tartness. 

M: Treacly body. Big alcohol that still manages to feel light. Carb is prickly. 

O: My wife is not a fan. I had to drink all of hers, and I was very happy to do so. I liked the 2007 version of this, and I like the 2012. I would prefer the 2007, though, but thats neither here nor there.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
499,"2014-10-10",4.7,"On tap at Kuhnhenn. The pour is a beautiful deep ruby. Crystal clear with a light pink head that quickly dissipates to a small collar. The aroma is ALL raspberry. Delicious. You get the sweetness of a chocolate malt, and a light caramel that just blends so beautifully. There isn't strong booziness on the back end that is nice for a strong fruit beer. The flavor is pretty intense. There is a lot of booze. The raspberry and malts mesh well for a nice fruity complexion with just a hint of malt and then a blast of booze. That's the only thing I can really knock it on. The mouth feel is great. Viscousy and delicious. There is a minimal amount of carbonation, but it's good. The aftertaste is lingeringly fruity and malty. Just awesome

Both tasted exactly like red Twizzlers licorice and Im really surprised to see nobody mentioning this given that both bottles I had tasted nearly identical to Twizzlers and Twizzlers have a very distinct flavor to them. I was hoping for heavy raspberries and got licorice instead.

499,"2014-08-28",3.9,"2012 Bottle, shared in a location remote to my dining room.
The beer almost looks as though still, with a deep reddish brown color. 

The aroma offers a huge raspberry character with some chocolate, some ""mead like"" honey, and some surprisingly mild booziness.

The flavor is enormously sweet, but its got a very true raspberry, even seedy raspberry flavor to it. Its boozy but surprisingly not boozy in an off putting way, the booze finds a way of being a warming as well as a balancing factor in the beer. Its got a whole bunch of chocolate character to it as well.

The beer is ridiculously viscous, just short of syrupy, and decidedly moth coating. 

I am not a lover of sweet drinks generally speaking, but Poltorak, Tokaji, Pedro Ximenez, & Ice Cider when well made are just as beautiful as any drink despite their almost impossible richness and overwhelming sweetness, this among the few beers that is to beer what those drinks are to their respective libations.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Medium carbonation provides a half-finger of off-white head that can be revived from the fine lacing with a couple swirls of the glass. Aroma is loaded with tart raspberry jam, coupled with rich caramel, vanilla and a slight alcohol. Taste has a great sweet/tart combination from the raspberry that is calmed by the full-bodied caramel and vanilla that follow. Sticky, syrupy and fulling coating of the palate.

The nose is dominant raspberry tart, jam, juice - Theres an earthen note, with caramel and toffee presence here as well. The flavor profile is bittering, but mostly from the alcohol note thanks to the ABV. Its not entirely meshing well, and I bet it needed a little age. I could be wrong, but its not what I remember from a past vintage. Its medicinal, raspberry juice, moving to seeds and earthen oak presence - theres caramel and a hint of more toffee here.

The pronounced alcohol and strong raspberry makes it more similar to a liquor or cocktail than a beer. Very nice aroma! The taste is also more similar to a liquor than a beer, cause it does not really have any bitterness, it has a huge sweetness, loads and loads of raspberries, and a strong warming alcohol, which are the two main dominant aspects.

499,"2013-10-05",4.5,"I had this on-tap at the Kuhnhenn Brewery as part of a paddle.

Appearance: I was shocked to see a little, tiny ring of pink/purple head on this beer. I had seen a few reviews of this beer, and it looked just like a dark black/purple/red color and nothing else. The lowpoint of this beer, but its also the part of the beer that matters least.

Smell: Flawless. This really smells like a urinal cake... in the BEST way possible. Maybe that wont do it for you. Alright. It smells like the raspberry that you whiff out of raspberry filled chocolates. This is just full of raspberries with maybe a hint of chocolate... whatever it is, this smells outstanding. Candle, please?

Taste: I noticed that some people called this syrupy thick. Overly sweet. Too much to handle. Really, I thought it was nearly perfect. This beer is most definitely a dessert beer (almost something youd pour over a vanilla ice cream... actually, that sounds fantastic), but whatever you wanna call it, its outstanding. Massive raspberry, but its not so tart/sweet that it becomes cloying.. easy for me to say, considering I had about a 3oz sample of it. Honestly, I didnt find this to be medicinal at all... Theres also slight chocolate note that gives this a needed extra dimension of flavor... yum. I also have to commend Kuhnhenn for the feel of this beer, as its not super carbonated (so it doesnt drink like a pop... though I wouldnt expect that given the ABV), and its not syrupy sweet (which I was afraid of after seeing reviews and the ABV). As for the alcohol in the flavor, I dont get it. All I get is a slight burn in my nasal cavity after I take a sip.

This is a damn expensive beer (About $15 for 6oz at the brewery), but you should include this as part of your sample paddle. This is something that any beer/wine/mead drinker would enjoy, I think.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

A: Pours a brownish, reddish color with a pretty still body. No real head forms on the pour.

S: Lots of sweet booze and malt with blast of smashed raspberries. Bready malts make up most of the flavor profile in the nose.

T: Tons of sweet raspberry. Much more than nose conveyed. Very jammy in nature with a little boozy heat. A mild burn is there with a heavy, bready malt profile to back it up.

M: Low carbonation with a chewy texture and mouthfeel. Sweet and hot on the finish.

O: This was good, but it definitely needs some time. The boozy notes are right up front and need some time to settle in.

499,"2013-06-10",3.8,"2012 Vintage
Aroma is dominated by raspberries. Some tart berry notes but overall fairly sweet. There is a slight medicinal note to it, but really faint. Light caramel and moderate chocolate malt notes help balance the raspberry. A bit of an alcohol note as it warms. 
Pours a surprisingly clear, but not perfectly clear burnt amber with brown notes to it. Small thin tan head that quickly recedes to the edges and disappears. 
Flavor starts with sweet raspberry with a light caramel and moderate chocolate note, but the beer is definitely dominated by sweet raspberry. The raspberry is similar to jam or a pastry. Medium bitterness and a moderately strong alcohol note in the finish. No medicinal flavor. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with very low carbonation. Low astringency and medium high alcohol warmth. Fairly sweet and somewhat cloying. 
Overall I'm not sure how I feel about this beer as a fresh beer. The raspberry flavors are too dominate, and fairly sweet. I think it will likely age well and help balance out the fruit notes. Age should also help add some complexity and mellow the alcohol heat. I expect an eisbock to have more malt character.

Aroma is a balance of sweet raspberry and chocolate; wishing for more aroma. Flavor is fairly sweet and intense raspberry, chocolate, and some alcohol, but its well hidden considering the ABV. This reminds me of eating a raspberry truffle. Love how this lingers on the palate with these really nice flavors and a little tartness. Great sipping beer.

499,"2013-03-03",4.1,"6 ounce draft at the brewery. Pours a dark raspberry color with no head. Aroma of raspberry and chocolate. Sweet taste of raspberry and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is medium. Did not detect much of any alcohol in the aroma or taste, which is good considering it is 15.5% I think. Glad I was able to try it and can see why it is sought after, but at $30 for a 12 ounce bottle, The financial guilt would detract from the enjoyment somewhat.

Holy Beergasm!! Easily the best aroma of any beer Ive ever enjoyed. Raspberry and chocolate are so intense that its like getting a scent of heaven.

Appearance is a beautiful reddish brown with a simple head.

Taste attacks the palate like a mugger in the night. It is so amazing how smooth the 15.5% slides down your throat without the heat of the alcohol.

My palate was overwhelmed with joy for 15 mins after I finished my glass. I literally had no clue a beer could do this to me.

Overall? Simply amazing. I LOVE the worlds best stouts and IPAs, but I would take this beer over so many of my favorite beers. It is going to take some ridiculous discipline to not drink the bottles I brought home that Im ""hoping"" to cellar.","Holt, Michigan, USA","joromiller"

Tastes a bit like a fine wine but richer and with a subtle carbonation.  Finish has no alcohol heat and just a touch of booziness.

This has a medium brown color with a raspberry tint. Slightly transparent edges. No head, this is pretty flat, just a few stray bubbles.

There is a definite blast of raspberries in the nose. This is so much better than what I had heard from other people at this point. For a 2007, this smells like raspberries just picked off the bush. Some malt sweetness behind the tart raspberry aroma.

The flavor is full of raspberriess, both sweet and sour and everywhere in between. Some toffee and malt flavors give it a kick of sweetness and a little bit more depth, but the focus is on the raspberries. Just fantastic.

The bottle is pretty much flat, and the body is fuller than medium. A light tart acidity is there, as is a light booziness.

Pours a very dark ruby red color thats almost brown with plum colored edges and a thin beige ring that slowly fades. Not much in the way of lacing. 

Sweet, slightly boozy aroma that surprisingly is still fruit forward after four years. Lots of sweet dark raspberry and other dark fruits along with some dark chocolate cake, caramel and toffee. Subtle medicinal/syrup quality. 

Fuller bodied than expected with some soft carbonation and a really nice balance of sweet, syrupy fruit, silky dark malts and subtle boozy heat/sweetness. Similarly to the aroma, there is still a surprising amount of juicy raspberry and other dark fruit notes. Faint tartness with some cranberry before being countered by hits of chocolate cake, caramel and toffee. Slightly syrupy but this doesnt hurt the mouthfeel much. A nice boozy warmth in the finish but the high ABV is excellently masked with only little heat. This beer is dangerously drinkable at this stage so 6.3oz is a perfect serving. Complex with a good amount of raspberry still in there. The perfect drink for after a huge holiday meal.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

499,"2011-03-31",3.8,"Had both the 2004 and 2007 vintages at a recent tasting. Thanks everyone, this was a long time curiosity for me. I feel as thought I had built it up in my mind a bit too much and was slightly let down. Eisbocks (bocks in general) are one of the styles I study a lot. This was an interesting example.

2004 - Beer was brown and clear with no carbonation, no head, no lacing. The aroma was strong full of malt and caramel. Definitely smell the raspberries and some chocolate? Wasnt expecting the chocolate smell. Lots of sweetness up front, raspberries come in late in the palate and are generally weak. Mostly a tart flavor from the raspberries. There is a lot of chocolate flavors in the midpalate regions. I find this flavor to be distracting and unnecessary. I find myself wishing that it was the malt and the berries without the chocolate. I know that the chocolate and the raspberry flavors pair well with food, but to stand the tart raspberry flavor next to the malt sweetness would have been great in my opinion.

2007 - Looks the same as the 2004, no head, no carbonation. The aroma is considerably stronger. Much more raspberries and the chocolate is still there. The flavor pops with a lot more raspberries. This is definitely my favorite out of the two. The sweetness from the malt is still there, the chocolate is less the star in this one. This beer is also thicker (it seems) than the 2004.

Overall, Im glad I got to try them both. Im not sure if I would seek it out again though.

It pours into my snifter like syrup and it is a brownish/reddish/goldish color with a surprising head after the higher gravity pour.

The smell is pretty outrageous, it is thick with caramel, chocolate, vanilla, and most dominant, raspberry. It smells like liquid dessert. 

The mouthfeel is full-bodied as expected but not as good as Aventinus Eisbock, which remains the king of all Eisbocks, but it is semi-syrupy and lightly carbonated.

The flavor follows the nose, with Raspberry liquer, hints of caramel, brandy, and other dark fruits. It isnt the taste explosion I was expecting after smelling it, but it is good nonetheless. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden and there really isnt enough here (although I split a bottle, but still) to really get your throat burning.

3.5 A: Opaque deep reddish purple color. No head, but signs of carbonation exist. A bit of particulate junk falls to the bottom.

Still pretty chocolatety, but not really that sweet, which is disappointing. I was hoping for something really sweet and fruity. A bit too much roasty bitterness as well. Alcohol is well hidden like in most Kuhnhenn brews. While this isnt bad, it doesnt live up to expectations.

Split with Ryan011235. Poured into two taster mini snifters.

A- This little bottle is quite the spectacle. Little mini 6.3 fl oz clear bottle, dipped in a burgundy wax that matches the beer inside. The tiny presentation is an interesting contradiction to the huge beer thats inside. The bottle looked like it was going to turn out flat, but thankfully I am presented with a very small head. It fades down to a collar before disappearing completely. The thick, concentrated beer leaves a solid coating on the side of the glass. The color is a lovely, deep sanguine red.

S- This aroma is in your face raspberry puree. Its very juicy and fresh. It calls forth images of raspberry preserves or a slice of raspberry pie. Although raspberries are the main characteristic here, it is possible to pick out a slight notion of the malts below. I can pick out a slight bit of rich chocolate. This is undoubtedly the most raspberry-strong aroma out there.

T- As expected, raspberry preserves are right in your face. It starts sweet and juicy but moves into a more leafy, wild raspberry flavor. There is a suggestion of tartness with a some bitterness at the finish. A little bit of rich chocolate is blended with the raspberries. Naturally, alcohol doesnt let itself be forgotten but it doesnt crash the party either. Its big and spicy but not bigger than those delicious raspberries.

M- Carbonation starts out kinda prickly. It does die down, especially with all the swirling Ive been doing. Once the carbonation has subsided a bit the sheer thickness of this beer can be fully appreciated. Its very syrupy and chewy. The juicy raspberries cling to every surface of the palate.

If you smelled it without knowing what was there, you would not think it was a beer, and you wouldnt notice the raspberries; you might confuse it for some kind of delicious caramel cheesecake.  But then you take a sip and theres a huge rush of raspberry goodness, lightly tart to offset the huge sweet flavors of caramel, vanilla, semisweet chocolates, and toffees.

S-Rich red raspberries, dark chocolate, caramel, and some boozy undertones. The raspberries really mix with the chocolate bock tones well.

T- Mild to moderate sour raspberries, creamy, cocoa upfront. Cocoa comes through more for the finish as an alcohol burn intensifies. A moderate sting of alcohol and a hint of cocoa come through for the finish-what lingers is a hint of raspberry and a big alcohol warmth.

M-Mild to moderate carbonation and fairly smooth light body with very little alcohol consistency.

D- For a nontraditional example of a hard to find style that it crammed with alcohol-this is really really good-happy to finally have the opportunity to enjoy this one!

S: Lots of raspberries--nay, raspberry tootsie rolls--sit atop a sweet malt base with a little bit of extra chocolate, and hits of earthiness.

T: Again, this really reminded me of a raspberry tootsie roll filled with a bit of alcohol. The flavors underneath were quite nice, with slight hints of brown sugar/molasses, a bit of maple, and maybe some anise.

M: Medium body with only a bit of carbonation.

Earlier Ratings: Miniature bottles courtesy of my boys SpencerDB, CaptainCougar, anyone else? So we tried 2004 and 2007. The pour is murky, muddy brown with low carbonation. Let me just say that this was not impressive whatsoever. Okay- its a slightly raspberry tangy super malt forward barleywine. I mean that is what this is. There is a lot of milk chocolate, raspberry chocolate, and it is just full of toffee. I mean its good but nothing that blew me out of the water. And that was the 04. The 07 literally tasted like broccoli. So- this is one that Ill have to revisit. For now- meh. 7/4/6/3/12=3.2Re-Rate:Another 2007 bottle. Pours muddy, reddish brown and completely flat.

499,"2010-02-25",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2010 6.3oz nip bottle from silphium...thanks Brad! - Pours rosy mahogany with a thin, velvety tan head. Smells of sweet caramel, booze-soaked German chocolate cake, raisins, molasses, coconut--about the only thing Im not getting is raspberry. Not that thats bad, because this is a sweet, decadent treat, but the raspberry just isnt there. Taste is port wine, raspberries, caramel--sweeter than the smell, but not boozy at all. And Im happy the raspberries are finally coming through. A little bitter on the finish--not sure where that comes from, but its not bad. Smooth and syrupy, this coats the glass--really viscous.

I could spend a long time just sniffing at this.  Flavor is of chocolate raspberries, strawberry, cherry, caramel, and toffee, with a little alcohol bite and mild oxidation notes.  Very refined.

A very cloudy reddish brown color. A minimal pale beige head develops, but dissipates instantly into a fine ring of lacings. After a while even these tiny bubbles fade away. Honestly, the qualities of this beer surly doesnt lie in its appearance.

The smell is very powerful. Huge amounts of sweet malts makes the smell really heavy. Plenty of genuine aromas of raspberries, but the fruits are not as prominent as I had expected. A hint of chocolate, some leather and tobacco, and quite a lot of oak-barrel. Alcoholic fumes hit the noose, but are well integrated with the sophisticated character of the smell. All in all, its quite reminiscent of fine spirits.

The taste is dominated by a dense and heavy malty character with lots of sweetness to it. The raspberries are present in the mouth, but again they are more subtle than I had expected. The raspberry flavors are of a really genuine quality, no raspberry candy in sight. Caramel, notes of tobacco and leather, and quite a lot of oak. I get a hint of chocolate, but its very faint. Perhaps I pick up the slightest hint of coffee. The finish is almost ridiculously long and has a great warming feeling to it due to the alcohol. The raspberries delivers a nice acidity that goes really great with sweetness from the malts and alcohol. All in all, the raspberries get more prominent towards the finish. Some residual notes of oak barrels and raspberry pits in the finish as well.

Very full-bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. It actually has a surprisingly high level of carbonation (which is still rather gentle) which seems to suit the beer nice since it lightens up the otherwise dense feeling and helps to spread all of the wonderful aromas around the mouth.

This is a great beer. Surly one of a kind that delivers an explosion of flavors and a great beer experience. Drinks like fine spirits, but still with that great character you cant get from any other type of beverage.

This stays on the palate for some time allowing the flavors time to be savored.  This poured into a snifter on a cold winter night is a nice way to relax.

The aroma is simply delectable - raspberry syrup, tons of caramel... like something you might drizzle over a great cheesecake. The flavor doesnt quite pull through, though - mouthfeel is great, but theres a grassy note that takes away from the pungent raspberry, and the alcohol shines a bit through the rest of the brew.

The raspberry aroma is still fresh and vibrant and is intermingled with caramel, dark chocolate, soft banana, and subtle spice.  The flavor follows through from this with more raspberry and cocoa and caramel fermentation notes.  The body is well structured with the alcohol definitely in check which offers a lot of substance.

499,"2009-07-08",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2011 I raise a glass to my cousin and thank him for opening this little gem!  Pretty much all the Top 100 stuff I have tried is thanks to him.  KRE comes in a cute little 6.3 ounce bottle.  Tangy raspberry and fruit aroma.  Reddish brown pour.  What an amazing flavor.  It is hard to find the words for it.  KRE is very complex and dances around the inside of the mouth.  Sour, fruity flavors mix with sweetness, astringency, and earthy notes.  Very complex and wonderfully enjoyable, with a kind raspberry finish.  This is the upper limit of fruit beers, maybe all beers.  A complex liquid chocolate raspberry brownie - unbelievable!.  Now this description is from the 2004 release, and it was my highest rated beer for quite a while.  Unfortunately the 2007, which I had on draft at the RattlenHum Kuhnhenn event, was not up to this awesome standard.  It was more sour and grainy, altho still a very complex and powerful brew.  One of the brewers told me that they would like to make more of this, obviously they are very proud of it, but that it is an enormous hassle to brew.  Still, hats off to Kuhnhenn for KRE, still their flagship beer and an amazing creation.","USA","Slipstream"

S: The appearence left me wondering, but at first whiff I knew I had a winner. Holy shit this one is beautiful. Think freshberries drizzled with caramel and hot fudge. I have not had a dessert in quite sometime with an aroma this wonderful.

T: After smelling this one, I had to dive in and give it a sip. WOW!!! I have had eisbocks before and I was some what luke warm to them. Well this is a totally different. The flavors are some of the most complex I have ever tasted. Think Fresh Ripe Indiana Raspberries, Wonderful Creamy Caramel, and the Best Belgian Chocolate known to man mixed together and put in a bottle. That is what this one is. Soo complex, soo wonderful, soo good. The flavors are so dynamic yet seperate. They do not compete with each other at all.

M: Thick and syrupy with ample carbonation.

D: Very little indication of the ABV. The flavor makes you wish this one came by the bomber.

Overall: This is one had I been after for quite sometime. I was glad to acquire it, and even happier with the first taste. The flavors and aromas are hard to beat. Most brewers out there try to replicate world class brews. There is a reason no one else it putting out something like this one. This beer is world class and can not be duplicated.

499,"2009-02-28",4.0,"2004 vintage.

Appearance: Pours a brackish, blackish-purple body with no head beyond a few, large bubbles.

Smell: Finely expressive nose of macerated, tart-scented black raspberry pulp and supporting earthy notes of cherry pipe tobacco, unsweetened chocolate, tree bark, molasses, and maple. An inkling of oxidation, too.

Taste: Beyond the berry, there are tastes of baking chocolate, blackstrap molasses, maple syrup, and a few choice hunks of gnarled licorice root. You even get a pinch of aromatic tobacco. Theres a fair share of oxidation evident. Also, I detect a tiny, tiny touch of roast. Theres a profusion of vinous raspberry flavor that is, at times, a bit tart and medicinal. The alcohol presence, while noticeable, isnt ever obtrusive. A bit of warmth in the slow, leisurely finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. No carbonation.

Drinkability: A pleasing, pleasant brew, though I would like to try a different, more recent vintage sometime. In summation, it reminds me of that Chambord Liqueur you get in the ""Holy Hand Grenade"" bottle. I hear up in Michigan its regarded as a local celebrity of sorts.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Deep brown coloured body with almost no head and a very faint light brown head. No bubbles, and nothing else showing that this beer is living - a bit bland in the appearance. Striking aroma of chocolate, caramel, figs, prunes, raisins and of course - raspberries. Full-bodied; Strong acidic and fruity taste up front of cherries and tart raspberries fading fast to chocolate and deep malt. Aftertaste shows a lot of complexity with the pit fruits really rolling through, caramel and toffee finishing up along with the chocolate and bittering spices and nuts. Overall, a complex but perhaps a bit overpowering beer. I enjoyed it, but Im glad this was only a double-split (187 mL) bottle - too bad it was also $9!

499,"2009-01-05",4.4,"On bottle. If there´s any beer I´ve been looking for, it is this; thank you Mads for sharing this gem with me.
Ruby, chestnut color, very small, white head. Almond, marzipan, cherry; one big kernelfriut-tight-aroma. The caramel and raspberries blend into a huge alcoholic lollipop of joy. The raspberries gets more dominant in the taste, along with a great bret-woodtartness, found in all the grand bockbeers. A long, lingering finish of alcohol and more berries. Rather onelined, but a wonder none the less and served cold with any winterdessert, this is a winner for the table.","DENMARK","JensenTaster"
499,"2008-12-30",4.2,"Acquired via trade with demitriustown from a 2007 bottling.  Let me just say that the hunt for this beer created expectations far beyond any beers reach.  Pours almost like a syrup.  Tastes like every part of a raspberry bush.  Gritty and earthy, but the natural sweetness of the raspberries and added elements of cocoa and caramel balance the flavor and make this a unique treat.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","nbutler11"
499,"2008-12-28",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2009 Bottle shared by nbutler11 like the gracious loving boy he is.  Thanks, Lt.  Perfect aroma because halfway through my share, it changed from deep seedy raspberry and chocolate ganache to potent vanilla with caramel edges.  Never saw it coming.  For me, the flavor was lacking because the beer smells like dessert but tastes rough, as if the dark chocolate and raspberry compete to mutual detriment.  I like the dirty undertow as well, but it could use reigning in.  I still feel lucky to have had this.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

I was expecting it to be a little more pink I think, but no sign of any raspberry-type colors.  No head.  Aroma is awesome, it reminds me of a chocolate danish with raspberry jam, very sweet and dessert-like, but still has all the underlying ""bock"" characteristics.  Taste... Has some alcohol up front, then just a little raspberry and some caramel malts.  Not so much chocolate in the flavor, but tasty anyway.  This seems a little over-rated and over-priced, but it’s still very good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
499,"2008-10-11",3.9,"6.3oz bottle, thanks to Sparky27.  Ive wanted to try this beer for a long time.  2007 vintage.  The bottle is very cute...and very small.  Pours a muddy, ugly brownish red.  Looks like a flat Barley Wine with a shot of cherry juice.  Basically no carbonation apparent, just a few tiny bubbles dispersed around the edges.  As I swirl the liquid it leaves legs behind on the glass. First impression of aroma is a blast of fresh raspberries.  Intense raspberry aroma with a noticeable sweet malt presence underneath, again Barley Wine like.  The raspberry aroma takes on a slight medicinal/syrupy characteristic but it is subtle and overall not too distracting.  Intense vanilla bean is also noted.  Alcohol hidden well, though it is noticeable (bottle says 11.9% unlike the 10.6% listed on the site).  The more I smell this the more pleasant it becomes.  A very nice, sweet, fresh raspberry smell.

Taste is rich, very fruity, flat and silky in the mouth.  Prickly raspberry and strawberry skins at first fade to a chocolatey lingering finish.  Very long finish, I can still taste this thing minutes after I last sipped.  Huge complexity in the flavor department.  A touch of alcohol heat mixes in with the fruitiness to give it an almost spirit-like or liqueur-like flavor.  A touch too hot.  This is interesting and I think this will improve with age.  Id love to try the 2004 version.  I think the alcohol heat and some of the medicinal notes will fade with time and this will turn into something lovely.  It needs to round out a bit but this is still excellent.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Poured a deep brown color with beautiful ruby highlights and a thin beige head that faded to a ring and tried to leave some light spotty lacing.  Aroma of sweet caramel malt, chocolate covered raspberries, some toffee, and a hint of lager yeast.  Smooth, fruity (a hint of apple?) entry leads into a sweet caramel maltiness and a lightly chocolaty raspberry fruitiness that leads into a light yeasty bitterness.

499,"2008-09-28",4.0,"2007 Vintage. 187 ml bottle courtesy of a trade with Jerk.  Pours a muddy amber with barely a film for a head that disappeared immediately after pouring.  The aroma is quite strong with lots of caramel along with lesser amounts of burnt caramel, chocolate, earthy notes, and finally raspberries.  As the beer warms, the raspberries in the aroma become much more apparent, as does the chocolate.  The flavor is caramel with some definite earthiness to it with raspberries and a bit of chocolate.  Very sweet, but not even remotely syrupy or cloying.  As the beer warms, the earthiness subsides and the raspberries and chocolate are more prominent.  In addition, the alcohol becomes more apparent, but does not interfere with the enjoyment of this beer. Virtually no bitterness to speak of at the finish.  Medium bodied.  A delightful and enjoyable beer.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

Aroma frightens me for a moment at first, all malt that borders on soy, reminding me of Sam Triple Bock.  Yikes!  Fortunately, after a few moments in the glass, the aromas open up and turn just spectacular, rich chocolate, caramel, and malt with a tootsie roll fruitiness that just builds the warmer it gets.  All melded together perfectly.  Couldn’t stop smelling this one.  Flavor is loaded chocolate and caramel, with dark fruits meandering in the background.  Clear heat on the finish.

The smell is pretty intense, with the obvious raspberry aroma, but with a huge sweetness featuring caramel and chocolate.  Alcohol burn increased as it warmed.
The taste is like a raspberry tootsie pop.  Lots of raspberry sweetness up front with chocolate mixed in as well.  The alcohol makes its presence felt with a burn in the throat through the finish and lingering between sips.
Mouthfeel is like a liquid dessert, syrupy sweet and sticky.
This is definitely a dessert beer and very much a sipper.  The sweetness is pretty intense and the alcohol is evident in the taste, especially as it warms.  Still, an extremely unique beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

I’m not a big fan of the marshmallow creme  flavor but I appreciate this beer for what it is.  Huge syrupy body that has a slight tingling carbonation.  This just keeps getting better and better the more it warms.

Pours absolutely still, with a mahogany body and crimson hues. Perfectly clear, as I managed to catch the dregs.

Aromatics are pungent, fruity, and earthy.
Loads of Port essense, vanilla, and raspberries. A hint of oak pulls through the boozy character. Tannic and concentrated in nature, with a balsamic nod. The vanilla is really a nice touch.
Intense and reminiscent of Earthmonk and Cuvee de Tomme.

Medium bodied, but chewy and tacky. Slicky from the lack of carbonation and high gravity.

Booze-laden raspberry juice starts the pallet, along with Madiera wine and cherry pits.
A tartness steps forward, and intense red fruits follow. Hints of cranberry, red Zinfindel, and earthy cedar linger.

Finishes with concentrated red fruits, port, bourbony fusels, and a light tartness.

Color is ruby/amber. Carbonation was close to nil. A light nose of raspberry, a touch herbal. The aroma reminded me of a thick buttery raspberry. Giving a little creamy raspberry mouthfeel with chocolat/caramel.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
499,"2008-06-25",3.6,"Thanks Naven.  This is something Ive wanted to try for a while, mostly due to all the attention it gets.  After dinner treat is right.  Very thick, sweet and would probably go well as a syrup in a bowl of vanilla ice cream.  Raspberry is there, but I sensed more semi-sweet chocolate.  Not really my thing, but I suppose for what it intends to be, its gotta be hard to beat.","La Mesa, California, USA","Bartzilla"
499,"2008-06-23",4.6,"Bottle courtesy of Juart.  Pours a deep copper red with a slight beige head that forms for a second then is gone.  The nose is a deep woody raspberry prune malt covered in dark caramel.  Notes of chocolate liquor as well.  A thick bitter sweet taste.  Tons of dark chocolate and caramel flavor layered with raspberries and alcohol.  There is a little flavor of raisins soaked in brandy with definite mahogany characteristics.  Very little carbonation, but a thick, rich body to it.  This is a truly outstanding beer that drinks like a port more than a fruit beer.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"

Pours a reddish brown with a thin tan off white head. Chocolate raspberry aroma, like a tort or dessert cake. Just an amazing aroma that keeps you from wanting to drink it. Thick malty berry sweet chocolate taste, just stunningly good. An absolutely wonderful dessert drink with the best aroma I have ever snorted.

Chocolate covered cherries with a bit of caramel. Dark amber clear with a hint of ruby. No head. Medium heavy body, almost chewy, with medium carbonation and quite an alcohol warming presence. Starts with overripe raspberry and cherry, light chocolate and alcohol sweetness. Mild tart acidity, quite sweet but not cloying. Finish is quite warming, with a medium bitter bite.

Rich Hershey milk chocolate, gooey caramel, and freshly picked raspberries are evident.  The aromatics are so intense and enjoyable, Id happily wear it as cologne!!!  Flavor is extremely complex, incorporating all of the above with additional molasses, toffee, and oak.  Unfortunately, this one seemed a bit too young.  The alcohol was distracting and overwhelmed the brew.  Syrupy mouthfeel...as stated in the description, would make a great ""after dinner treat"".","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"

Taste of raspberry and caramel, with a finish of alcohol burn.  Thick and creamy mouthfeel.  Clearly a quality brew, very rich, definitely a sipper.  Bit too much for me, though.

Chocolate leads to caramel sweetness, raspberry, and then more chocolate to finish the smell.  Mouthfeel is very silky with some carbonation.  It has a nice medium base to it.  The base malts in this remind me somewhat of a lighter base version of the darklord.  Taste is what I expected.  Flavors of chocolate raspberries, caramel, and dark chocolate come together perfectly.  Overall this is what a fruit beer should be.  Next time Im in Michigan I am going to have to stop by the brewery to check out what else they have.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"

Exquisite mouth feel, very silky yet not heavy.  The flavor on this gently kneels down to the nose but still has quite the clout...cocoa, raspberries, dark malts and brachs caramel squares are all noted.

499,"2008-05-10",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2010 Rating #1000, at midnight on my 1-year RB anniversary.  2007 bottle. Pours a dark, cloudy, ruby red color.  A foamy, beige colored head settles to a wispy film, leaving some sudsy lace and thick legging to slowly droop back towards the body.  The nose is quite nice.  Its like a chocolate Caramello bar infused with fresh, candied raspberries and almonds.  Flavors, too, are intensely sweet and candy-like.  Milk chocolate and caramel exert significant influence, while moderately tart raspberries lend a slightly sour, fruity funk.  Evaluated on the whole, the flavor is best described as a fresh raspberry dipped in a bath of chocolate and caramel, only slightly medicinal from the big alcohol content.  The body is nearly full, slick, and viscous, with a touch of a syrupy, warm, tart finish.  Im not particularly fond of fruit beers, eisbocks, or syrupy dessert beers in general, but I cant help but respect how well this brew is crafted.  Very nice in small quantities.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

499,"2008-04-22",4.3,"2007 Vintage, thanks to GrbDg for sending this one. Awesome! This little guy packs some serious flavor and a hell of a body. Shared with Katie alongside some Bourbon Barrel Angels Share. Velvety pour that produces light brown bubbling and a stained-wood color similar to brandy. I felt that the raspberries contributed most to the aroma, releasing a wonderful nose of dark chocolates, toffee, complex caramel malts...and of course, a dump-truck of raspberries. Chocolates stand out more in the flavor, with the raspberry fading rather quickly with an aftertaste of leather and sweet brown sugar. Body is amazing, so soft and oily, soothing and rounding out the fruity notes. Great stuff, Im sure it ages damn well.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

499,"2008-04-20",4.2,"A- Pours a deep scarlet, very similar to fourth dimensia only without a head.

S- Second brew ive tried from kuhnhenn, second absolutely intoxicating aroma. Deep raspberries much like New Glarus raspberry tart but theres something behind it, namely a well hidden alcohol aroma that lingers in the nostrils.

T- Much more interesting of a brew than the aroma let on. Nice, however truncated, raspberry flavor followed by quite a bit of alcohol warming. This beer is very hot right now and I think it would round out a little more with some age under its belt.

M- Thick with ample carbonation.

D- Its hard to comment on the drinkability of this beer. On one hand, I love its complexity but on the other the booziness needs to cool off a bit. An amazing brew that im sure ill try again.","California, USA","Lothore"

Shame it was then that while it thought everything else was excellent I really couldnt get into the aroma.In fact initially I gave it a 4 but it grew on me a bit. Its just spoiled for me by the thick and sickly caramel malt. Anyway, aroma moan over. Its a beautiful looking awesome ruby red / brown colour. Flavour is gorgeous. A bit of chocolate, lovely fruit, awesome light sourness and barrel notes. The raspberries come on strong for the finish with the only obvious alcohol being a pleasing warmth in the belly and a lingering sting on the tongue.

Bottle made a pop sound when opened, so Im feeling a bit better about oxidization issues.  Pours a ruddy brown color that, well, sort of looks like swill, but you know this means business nevertheless.  Almost no head to speak of.  Aroma is gorgeous...loads of raspberry, caramel, sweet chocolate blended together with some roasted nuts in the background...a unique aroma that is outstanding!  Flavor is more complex than I expected...the raspberry almost takes a backseat to strong caramel and milk chocolate accents, but the raspberry comes through at the end and in a nice way...heavy on the sweetness but stopping well short of being cloying.  Picking up some orange flavors...and almost gives me the vibe that there is some Grand Mariner mixed in.  Alcohol flavor is still prevalent after 4 years.  Finish is surprisingly sour and bordering on acidic, so Im thinking something kicked in over time, and there is a good dose of carbonation here still.

Dark ruby color, small off-white head. Very strong aroma of ice cream - ice cream with mocha and vanilla. Full-bodied. Very sticky mouthfeel.

499,"2008-03-11",4.3,"2004 sample courtesy of my friend Chris (cquiroga). Turbid and brown like a glass full of mud, Kuhnhenns Raspberry Eisbock lacks any head, or indeed any resemblance to beer. The dense aroma strongly echoes that fact. An incredible scent filled with gallons of milk chocolate and raspberry coulis. The unctuous, decadent smells of rich caramel, marzipan and peanut butter crowd the nose. Hints of alcohol are noticeable but the subtle balance is well executed even amongst such opulence. Cherries, hazelnuts, almonds and blackberries provide additional complexity, further supplemented by hints of pumpkin, nutmeg, black pepper, touches of vanilla, Grand Marnier and coconut. The luscious, buttery fragrance is almost overwhelming. Milk chocolate reappears at the forefront of the palate, again in monstrous quantities and accompanied by a clean shot of cherry or blueberry liqueur. The flavor profile is similar to what is experienced on the nose, but somehow doesnt reach the same climax, perhaps due to the alcoholic presence. Orange-flavored Pims cookies are quite apparent, followed again by coconut, marzipan and a staggeringly rich caramel finish. The long aftertaste dominated by chocolate, raspberry and a hint of licorice suggest a perfect topping for ice cream. Soft, smooth, malty. A fantastic and unique brew.

Served at cellar temperature. Selfishly shared with me, myself, and I. Pretty thick pour; hazy ruby reddish-brown color. Head was one finger high, light tan, and fizzled to a ring in a minute or so. Aroma was of milk chocolate and raspberry liqueur; reminiscent of a raspberry Tootsie Pop. Medium to full bodied and sweet with lots of alcohol warmth that sank slowly into my mucous membranes. I suspect the alcohol lightened the body up somewhat. Smooth, velvety mouth feel with ample carbonation. Distinct raspberry liqueur, toffee, and subdued chocolate flavors came out. Nice sipping beer.

The flavor had a lite tartness, matured raspberry, a smokey/meaty tobacco flavor, a little oxidized and some earthiness. The palate was smooth with no alcohol. The 2007 poured a dark reddish brown with a thin tan brown head. The aroma epitomized raspberries covered in chocolate and caramel, very distinct for all three, goddamn that is a beautiful nose.

The palate was warming with hidden alcohol and lite carbonation. This one is a little green still. Id like to see it with a year or two on it. I still preferred the 2007 but man they were both amazing.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"

Beautiful balance and flavor of liquid chocolate raspberries...has held up beautifully.  I find this first batch to much more chocolately than the more recent.
Re-tastedthe 2004 at  3/1/08 at big tasting...no cardboard in aroma and more raspberry.

Pours a dark reddish brown, with thin braids of lacing prevalent. Very thin, but well carbonated head. Aroma is great: raspberry, chocolate, candy corn, silky slivering malts. The candy corn especially comes through in big chunks. Flavor is powerful. Well blended raspberries, very warming chocolate, candy corn, nougat intertwined with a waterfall of caramel. Delightful. Very bright finish, bitter mouthfeel. Astonishingly drinkable, and exceptionally well-balanced. Deserved of its praise.","Tampa, Florida, USA","gunhaver"

499,"2008-02-11",4.4,"2004 - Pours a slightly hazy amberish brown, with no head. Wisps of small bubbles. Smells like a sweet raspberry chocolate torte. Full of fruity frosting, this has a very sweet smell, with smooth chocolate through and through with some caramel as well. Flavor is a perfect balance of rich toffee, chocolate covered cherries, and caramel dipped apples. Wonderfully bittersweet and sour raspberry puree. Delicious, but comes somewhat cloying as it warms.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
499,"2008-02-06",4.0,"Aroma: is red, ripe raspberry, full bodied, almost port-like, but not quite there yet.  Instead it is a rich caramel accent to the raspberry. And a touch of leather, but I might be reaching.
Taste is sweet raspberry, touches of alcohol and caramel. 
Palate is slightly fizzy, rich, cloying raspberry caramel sweetness, followed by a dull alcohol that is only familiar because of the carbonation.
Overall, with about 3 to 5 years on this, this beer would be world class.  As it is, it is merely outstanding.

499,"2008-02-03",4.8,"2004 Vintage. In word.....AMAZING. The most decadent beer you could ever get.....its like the most lucious dessert you have tasted. Aroma of raspberries, dark chocolate and wine. Flavors of mellow raspberries, dark chocolate, caramel, and almond. The mellow raspberries (no doubt from the three years of aging) give this beer a truly unique character. They are not overpowering, but a always on the edge of the palate, complimenting every aspect of the beer. Alcohol is very warming, but not overpowering in the flavor. Overall, an absolute dream...like biting into the moistest, most succulent chcolate cake ever.","Norman, Oklahoma, USA","milljam"
499,"2008-02-02",4.3,"Sampled on-tap. First off, I can understand why this comes in 6.5 ounce bottles. Second off, wow. 

Pours a ruby tint with absolutely no head. Nose is total raspberry funk with what seems like almost a plastic type of character to it. Flavor is strong raspberry with thick malts. I never really felt that alcohol was present flavor wise. Feel is a bit thicker on liquid and low on carbonation. I also get a slight gritty kind of edge. Not so much that it ruins the experience, but enough to notice. I kind of take it like it is one step below being too much. If it was pushed any further, it wouldnt work. But overall, it does work since it is so damn unique. I have to say that two ounces of this would probably be good enough for me unless I had a long while to really dwell on the bottle or in this case what was served to me off the tap.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

499,"2008-01-28",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2010 ++++ Re Rate 5 May 2009 ++++187 ml bottle from mj. 2007 Vintage.  Pour is murky brown, orange and copper. Only the thinnest amount of tan head, that quickly retreats to the edges of the glass. Aroma of big rick mulling brown sugar, along with dark chocolate, caramel maltiness and faint raspberry. Also a bit of Sherry warmth, certainly far less boozy than the last time I had this. Nose is big, rich - really inviting. Taste is immediately huge raspberry fruit sweetness, more of the caramel chocolate maltiness and a big warming Sherry taste. The chocolate gets. Dusty cocoa taste to it during the long finish. The age seems to have flattened out some of the fruit tart / sweetness I remember on this.  Its more of a clovey spice now.  Palate is big, bold - almost entirely flat. As mentioned, the finish is long, dry and warming.  Thanks for sending me this one Mike, the last time I had this it was young and under less than ideal circumstances. Nice to revisit with a whole bottle.  I enjoyed it about the same, though in different ways.  Overall, a nice sipper. For a beer of its heft, it is remarkably smooth. (9,4,8,4,17 - 4.2)

Alcohol and fruit mingle well on the tongue but never quite come together harmoniously. Toffee, chocolate, wood tannin, raspberry and cherry. Thick, sweet but not cloying.

The taste was like a luscious, moist chocolate cake intermingled with mellow raspberries and hints of caramel and almond.  Truly a dessert beer.  Interestingly, the raspberries seemed to be quite mellow, which is what really set this apart from some other fruits Ive had.  They played a secondary, yet no less succulent role.

Delightfully sweet malty honey raspberry.  Creamy some some subtle unoffensive alcohol beneath the surface.  Caramel, creme brulee.  A little bit of molsasses.  Flat as can be on the tongue.   No carbonation.  Not syrupy, yet thick.  Its as though the alcohol cuts the viscosity.  Relatively tart raspberry over a sweet smooth malt.  Light on the tastebuds, ethereal really.  Balanced alcohol and raspberry tartness against malt.  Some diacetyl, but its largely cut by the alcohol.  Mellow with a clean fruity finish.  I didnt pick up much chocolate like most people, but I dont think it really hurt this beauty!
2007 vintage, thanks again yjb!  Differences?  Bigger dark malt character.  Thicker and fuller on the tongue.  More chocolate.  More raspberry in the nose, for sure, fuller and richer at least.  Less alcohol?  Perhaps a bit murkier?  Maybe age will make this thing shine just as much.  In the meantime, I have to give this same for appearance and nose.  Up the palate to 4-5, downgrade flavor to 7 and overall to 16-17.  Current scores reflect averages.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Pours a brownish red with a small film head. Then the bouquet hits me - wow! How to describe...? There is so much fruityness to this aroma, that it ends up smelling like chocolate! That will not make sense to anybody who havent tried this brew, but I think most of you who has, will agree. So chocolate, naturally raspberries, some oakyness, a litlle raisins and so much more. Extremely nice, creamy mouthfeel as well, helped by the relatively large ABV. Round and full flavours, dominated by fruityness, viniousness, chocolate, raisins and a slight sour note. So incredibly well-balanced, I was amazed. The aroma should be a 12 out of 10 though! :o)","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

The complexity of what hits you are indescribable, but I am going to try anyway. Small creamy and beige looking head that mostly diminished. Spar display of lacework. Muddy looking reddish brown color. Surprisingly one of the first aromas that I picked up was chocolate or sweet coco. Then came an assortment of notes: amazing raspberry, fruit gum like, bubblegum, raisin, pear, peach, apricot, spice, vanilla and light vinegar. The experience was borderline to a good red win or port win. Very vinous I must say. Full bodied with a light alcoholic and sticky texture, combined with a smooth mouth feel. Average carbonation could be detected. Moderated sweet flavor with light notes of acidic. Raspberry sweet and long lasting finish.

499,"2007-06-16",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2008 2004 bottle tasted June 16th 07.

Pours a deep caramel brown with scant head. The nose is deeply impressive: shaved bitter chocolate, raspberries, chocolate truffles, dark caramel, tootsie roll, a marvelous rolling-together of dessert aromas. The flavor is surprisingly tart, carrying little of the expected sweetness. Instead, raspberries and bitter chocolate, but also the beer has oxidized considerably, and Im afraid this detracts from the flavor. The fault is mine for keeping it in the cellar too long; I wonder whether it would have been similar a year ago. Mouthfeel is smooth, less syrupy than I might have expected, and very nice; I dont feel the alcohol whatsoever.

Im very glad to have tried this one, though I am kicking myself for waiting so long for the right special occasion. (The occasion tonight: I wanted something that could hope to do justice as a nightcap to the best dinner Ive had in Seattle to date, at Cascadia.). 10/4/7/4/16=4.1

Pours a nearly still red chcolate-brown Like the 2004, lovely caramel and raspberry nose, tootsie roll. Not as muchj chocolate as I recall from that one, and none of the oxidation. The flavor is again not quite as chocolate-rich as the other, and its sweeter (mostly a good thing).  All of that oxidation is absent and I get the sense that Im tasting a not-quite-as-good beer in much better condition. Beautiful smooth soft cordial mouthfeel with no heat from the alcohol. Ill give this a 9/4/9/5/17=4.4, though Im tempted to ding it one point on the overall  because at $13 for six ounces (split two ways) I dont feel like I can drink deep.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

499,"2007-05-15",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2008 Glugs from the bottle a murky, muddy brown with fiery burned red highlighting at the edges. A tan head looks like a dollop of cream and is hesitant to fade back from where it originated. The aroma is seraphic and very strong, steamrolling forward while maintaining a delicate intimacy. Red raspberry preserves have a sticky quality even in the nose. Milk chocolate and dark chocolate meet the fruit in a pleasant medium, neither outweighing the other in potency. Alcohol is almost entirely masked. Restraint from succumbing to the desire to inflict a glass-emptying gulp is nearly impossible to maintain. Caramel and wood scents are mellow but succulent. Notes of blackberries, cafe mocha and light honey are recognizable in a distant little aromatic cluster, very flighty. It seems like for every iota of alcohol intensification garnered through the process that was undergone to create this eisbock, the fruit clarity and ferocity was magnified equally, retaining a raspberry and chocolaty core and overwhelming softness. At times throughout nosing this I got a sensation that there was an underlying funkiness, a tartness that bound together the fruit and dark malts and gave the entire experience an ancient, mystical, medieval character. Magical. The flavor is just as provocative, just as complicated. Sweetness is very intense, raspberry charging to the forefront. Malts seem to coalesce and disperse so evenly across the tongue, like Kuhnhenn has managed to liquefy and bottle a fruit sandwich. Additional notes of pie filling and crust grasp for a chance at recognition, amplifying the density of the mouthfeel. Vanilla makes brief and shy appearances. Tartness grows steadily with each sip. Zero bitterness. The finish is as long as they come, sweet chocolate covered raspberries and seed-like particles lingering for an admirable time. The palate is obscenely full-bodied, very sticky, lowly carbonated, very slick and incredibly velvety. There is certainly enough carbonation, as it sustains the head for some time, but the viscous body prevents any rapid upward progression of bubbles and restrains any fizziness that may otherwise be apparent. Stunningly thick, amazing drinkability. 

This could be the premier example of confrontational fruit flavor with slick viscosity that never succumbs to a cloying taste, extreme skill manifested in a pocket-sized package. I suppose I could drink this every day, were those small bottles always readily available. The first time I tried this I wished the bottle were larger, though after multiple samples I find this the perfect size. A truly great achievement.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

2004 Vintage...  Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock pours an interesting color.  It looks like watery milk chocolate with a maroon hue to it.  Its also quite murky with no head or crown.  It looks pretty thick on the pour.  The carbonation is ultra fine bubbles and active resulting in a slow churning effect.  The aroma and flavor are both very good and quite intense, but somewhat difficult to describe.  The aroma is saturated with raspberry, brown sugar, caramel, and hints of some underlying chocolate.  The chocolate subtlety is difficult to describe as it isnt really like milk chocolate, dark chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, etc.  Regardless, the aroma is quite intoxicating in itself since it is so intriguing and intense...  At first the flavor is lighter and fruity and contains real raspberries and some slight tartness.  It is quite vineous-like (lots of red wine qualities) in the beginning.  Then it moves into a really deep, rich, and sugary caramel flavor with chocolate undertones and hints of raspberry wafting through it.  These flavors linger on the palate for quite some time which allows plenty of time for enjoying and pondering the many flavors.  Im not really sure how much alcohol is in this beer, but it is completely masked by the complex and concentrated flavors!  At first this beer seems like it has a full body, but the mouthfeel is more like medium.  However, it does coat the entire mouth very nicely allowing for residual flavors long after all the beer is gone.  This is certainly a well crafted and complex beer.  However, the small bottle and exorbitant price really detracts from the overall excitement and enjoyment of this beer though.  Dont get me wrong; this is a really good beer and is definitely worth having once or twice, but its not that good to stock up on it or drink it often (or even several times per year) at the current price/value of roughly $10/bottle...

So what did my wife think about this beer?  Well, here are a couple of here comments...  When describing the initila flavor she said, ""Its like drinking raspberry jam!""  Toward the end she then said that it reminded her of a Lindt Raspberry Chocolate bar.  Shes right, it does!  Needless to say, she enjoyed this beer quite a bite, but quickly felt the effects of the alcohol and still prefers New Glarus Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart more.  I would agree...

Loads of natural ripe raspberries and raisins. More flavors develop towards the finish with chocolate, brown sugar, hint of cinnamon. It reminds me slightly of Raisin Bran cereal. This stuff is definitely a world class brew.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Small bits and sediment cloud the last flute.  Nose is exotic yet earthy.  Warm and comforting spiced raspberry cider simmering on the stove of an old country cabin.  Taste follows suit with raspberry jam, sherry and caramel.  Woody drying with some orange.  Ambrosia in the mouth.  Faint carb tingle.  Really takes fruit beer to the next level.

499,"2007-02-10",4.4,"Vintage 2004. 6.3 ounce bottles. In so many ways does this beer remind me of being in Porto, Portugal.

Pours a tawny red. Essentially flat. Yeast at first floats around the glass before mixing in with the beer. 

Aroma simply knocked me off the couch. Chocolate dipped raspberries. Choclate fondue. Strawberries. Short cake. Fantastic.

Flavor is more subdued than the aroma. Raspberies and chocolate predominate. Alcohol is perfectly concealed. Also picking out other fruits such as raspberries and cherries. Vinuous port wine qualities.

Lighter body than I imagined. The beer sticks to the tongue and slowly dissolves leaving some slight alcohol heat.

Almost smells like an aged barley wine.  Poured a very deep almost opaque red with a non-existent head.  Now lets get to the good part....the taste.  Deep textures of raspberries and the dark chocolate come to the forefront.  A very light almost buttery sweetness with a oaky and caramel flavors.  This stuff just sticks to your palate.

Flavor has just a bit of tang from the raspberries with a bit of dark chocolate and a little roast coming through towards the finish.  Tobacco leaves are still present.  After the inital tastes, I am beginning to find some vanilla as well.  Come to think of it, I am able to smell a little vanilla now.  Dry finish.

499,"2007-01-25",4.3,"2004 bottle, courtesy my brother in Cleveland, OH - a great guy and a true beer enthusiast. Deep mahogany pour with virtually no head, and just a few stray bubbles here and there. Glorious aroma of raspberries, chocolate, alcohol, and dark brown sugar. Mouthfeel is rich and thick with a bit of stickiness, and no carbonation, which is how it is intended to be I believe.  Sweet flavor of raspberry and chocolate is unmistakable, but there is a twinge of bitterness just in time, so the finish isnt sticky sweet.  I think one has to have a very open mind when drinking this, because it is certainly not beer in the sense that one is used to. It is a beeer because it was brewed with barley malt, but it is intended to be a cordial. If drunk warm and in the same setting that one would drink cognac or Grand Marnier, I think it can be appreciated as an extraordinary brewing achievement.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

Medium / thick body tht is sticky and oily with a minor amount of carbonation.  The flavors start similar to the aroma with chewy caramel and milk chocolate in the front and raspberries in the back.  On the finish the raspberries open up more and there is a abv kick as well.  Very unique and enjoyable beer.  This is the kind of thing Id like to actually drink, but at only 6.2 oz it is a sipper.  As it warms there is a present toffee and fruity sourness on the initial taste.  The finish begins taking more of a sourness from the raspberries and then gets very pleasantly tart.

A bit of chamomile herbal character in there too. Very full bodied, lightly carbonated. Syrupy? Yeah, I guess I would call it syrupy.

Again, a nice  melding of chocolate and raspberries with some caramel hints as well.  It felt very silky and thick on the palate and the alcohol wasnt very discernable.

499,"2007-01-14",4.3,"6.3 oz bottle.

Pours a dark red tinged brown, with a small tan head that fades very quickly to nothing. Due to lack of any head theres no lacing to speak of. Not much to look at, but it was to be expected with the high abv.

Smell; the raspberries really jump out of the glass, and are mixed with a very rich chocolate aroma. A touch of caramel is present in the nose, along with a nice nutty background.

Taste; as expected the raspberries are very evident in the flavor, and it definitely does not come of as artificial at all, which Im very thankful for. The chocolate comes out next, and nearly as strongly as the raspberries do. The nutty flavors are very much present as well, and provide just enough of a bittering effect to offset the sweetness of the raspberries and chocolate. Theres some hints of vinegar in the background that, surprisingly, seems to fit right in with everything ealse going on in this beer..

Mouthfeel/Drinkabilty; the mouthfeel on this one maybe the fullest, and mostly velvety of any beer that Ive ever had. The drinkability is very good.

Between the raspberries, chocolate, nuts and very full mouthfeel, this is like drinking a chocolate raspberry cake with a some walnuts or pecans thrown. This was my first beer of 2007, and boy was it a good one.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

499,"2007-01-01",3.7,"Bottle (2004 vintage) from the brewery. OK, I was planning on having this on New Years Eve as beer #1700, but I drank less than I expected over the holidays, plus I lost a rating a few days ago. So I didnt quite make the milestone, but I still had it as my NYE treat. Pours a murky looking ruby-brown with a very still body and a faint wisp of a tan head. Aroma is worrisome at first - some chocolate & caramel, but seeming quite stale. Whatever it was cleared after a few moments, and it became much more pleasant, developing notes of raspberry and sweet alcohol. Body is soft and smooth, very nice. Flavour is pleasant - nice notes of chocolate, toffee, raspberry, licorice, some slightly woodiness - but it didnt knock my socks off. Its a very good beer, no doubt about that, but it didnt live up to the hype for me. Ill enjoy the other two bottles Ive got stashed away, but I wont be going out of my way to get any more, especially at the ridiculous prices that Kuhnhenn charges for their stuff.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"

Aroma of chocolate drenched raspberries, old leather, and brandy, accented by a hint of roasty malt. Silky and velvety in the mouth. Taste is unique, more like a cordial than a beer. Caramel and chocolate notes wrap around the bold raspberry profile to provide an exceptional depth. Raspberry tartness gets swallowed up in the creamy chocolate at times.

499,"2006-12-25",3.7,"Thanks to Pailhead for this beer.  Poured a cloudy mahogany with a small light tan head.  Extremely rich and sweet aroma of generic dark chocolate, a touch of caramel, molasses, and some slight cherries or raspberries.  Flavor starts with a striking acidity which doesnt seem to resonate any particular fruit flavors... I probably would not have guessed raspberry, except for the fact that it says so on the bottle.  Some toffee flavor shows up, tasting a bit stale.  Other flavors that arise are dark chocolate, cream and light caramel.  Finishes somewhat sour and dry.  Rich and complex, but only decently enjoyable, as many of these flavors dont seem to meld.  Given the (almost too) intensely sweet aroma, I expected to be a much sweeter beer than it was.  The tartness tasted like an off flavor to me.  Combined with the toffee, it tasted a tad on the generic side.  I respect what the brewer was doing here and I understand why many people like this, but this didnt work out as world class to me.  Ill give it points for richness and complexity, but this will probably remain an overrated top fifty selection for me.

I really have no starting point for rating this one and I did not rate it during our anniversary dinner.  My impressions were most positive, though it was unlike anything I expected.  I had this with a maple spiced cake and it went together most swimmingly.  The aroma was out of sight with cake, chocolate, coco, caramel, marshmallow, raspberry cordial, and other sweet treats.  The body was not as I expected as this was drier than I anticipated and more carbonated as well.  It did grow on me though.  The flavor was a mixed experience of surprise, disappointment and delight.  I was surprised at how much this tasted like it smelled (see above), disappointed in the fact that I really expected overpowering raspberry and did not get that particular kind of sweet treat (read, raspberry tart-New Glarus), and delighted in that I did not care about the second in that everything about the flavor and tasted was as I noted, and it went so well with our dessert.

499,"2006-09-23",4.5,"Bottle, with ClarkVV and Sully. This was very good. Cherry, chocolate/caramel in the nose, quite malty and fruity, due to the raspberry. Mouthfeel has a sweet sherry and dessert wine sticky sweetness, but remains quite smooth, and almost a little bit juicy aswell. The alcohol is well masked, but it still stays quite strong throughout the mouthfeel. Im not normally a fan of super-sweet stuff like this, but this really worked for me in the end. Beautiful blend of the caramelly malt and the rasberry fruit. Fantastic.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"

Ive been holding on to a few bottles of this for quite a while now, waiting for a milestone, and they kept passing me  by -- well this much anticipated day has finally arrived. Here goes. Pours a murky brown with red hues and no head. Wonderful aroma of caramel malt, raspberries, chocolate, dark fruit, brown sugar, spices and alcohol -- just an amazing aroma. Flavour of fresh, slightly tart raspberries, Belgian chocolate, caramel malt, dark fruit and just the right amount of alcohol -- quite complex and delicious, Im wishing the bottle wasnt so small. For 10.6% this is incredibly easy to drink. Nice medium to full body. Well it was definitely worth the wait, its up there with the New Glarus Raspberry Tart as one of my favourite Fruit beers and thankfully, I have several more stashed away.

499,"2006-08-23",4.6,"Ive been hanging on to a few of these bottles for special occasions. Decided to pop one with the recent birth of my new baby daughter.
Appears a dark, turbid brown with a ruby hue when held up to the light. The tiny, off white head quickly fizzles out into a collar that also fades out into this special brew.
Smell is better than anticipated. Rich, malty, chocolaty fudge with brown sugar, caramel notes, vanilla, and a heavy drizzling of a thick, raspberry reduction infused with cocoa powder.
Taste is of the same outstanding aromatics, making this a winner among many winners. Flavors are of a confectioners heaven that combines the sugary notes of cocoa, brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, and raspberries that have been flambed with an alcohol blend highlighted with Rum. This is like an after dinner brandy, or cognac.
Mouthfeel is rich, smooth, balanced with the sugars, and non-cloyingly delicious.
Jesus God...if this is what heaven is, Ill make a concerted effort to get my ass to church more often. This is heavenly and addictive. Kuhnhenn is set to take over the world 6.3 ozs at a time! Fin great stuff.

Raspberry chocolate covered cheesecake, confectioners sugar, caramel,artificial fruit and vodka coolers.

499,"2006-08-12",4.6,"2004 Bottle:  Absolutely no head on this brown/ruby beer.  The top of the beer looks oily and viscous.  The nose is literally out of this (beer) world.  This is fudge cake drizzled with raspberry glaze.  Deep, rich cake with chunks of warm fudge with a balanced raspberry tartness and a nice peppering of alcohol beneath.  Wow is all I can say, and I havent even tried it yet.  The body reveals a slight carbonation, but remains mostly velvetty and slick.  The tartness of the raspberry hits me first, spreading the deep, chocolate malts across the tongue.  The tartness of the fruit softens with the sweet chocolate and evolves more into a strawberry realm.  Even deeper notes of caramel and toffee emerge as the alcohol begins to warm in my stomach.  What a refreshing beer, its great to see brewers continuing to push the limits of hops, malts, yeast and water (OK and fruit).  Fabulous stuff.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Even some fine dark chocolate notes to it - quite simply one of the nicest smelling beers I have tried.  Rich silky mouthfeel.  No really, silk best describes it.  Taste:  tons of rich chocolate surprisingly stands out at first, followed by fresh raspberries, and only some of the alcohol I was expecting.  Dense dense beer - complex stuff that I mulled over for a good hour.  Less raspberry, tons more chocolate, surprisingly balanced than I was expecting.

499,"2006-08-08",4.7,"Big thanks to Ross for a 6 ounce bottle of the 2004 vintage.  This one has eluded me for a long time.  The pour was hazy deep ruby brownish, with a nice 1-finger, creamy tan head.  The aroma was big raspberries, plus some figs, blackberries, chocolate, and caramel malt.  The palate was dense and complex, with flavors of big raspberry, plus cacao, caramel malt, dark chocolate, and some yeasty notes.  Very complex and dense palate that acquired some heat as it warmed.  IS this one a top 50 beer??  I say yes with a lot of conviction.  In fact, I think you could remove the raspberries altogether from this one, and it would still be a top 50 beer.  This bottle is going on my mantel piece.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
499,"2006-08-01",4.6,"This beer is absolutely one of my all time favorites. Pours a murky dark brown (its only flaw in IMO), with little to no head. The aroma is stunning. So many things going on, yet not one over powers the other. Raspberries, chocolate roast, dark fruits, molasses, and candied malts. If that isnt tantalizing enough, the flavor is even better. Your mouth is greeted with a raspberry nose that is very refreshing and then followed up with a deep chocolatey roast flavor that melds perfectly with the raspberry. While all this is going on you can also taste dark candied fruits, brandy, some dark sugars. Alcohol is very well hidden. To me, this beer was best when served fresh from the cellar; its an absolute treat.","Doylestown, Ohio, USA","black95tt"

Smooth melted creamy chocolate with tart raspberry, kissed with dark fruits; plums, prunes and blackberries.

Light caramel and sherry flavors mid palate.  Finish is toasty malt and sweet w/ a raspberry flavored chocolate.  Lingering aftertaste is raspberry and toasted malt.

499,"2006-07-04",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2007 Bottle from walleye, thanks Jim.  I dont really know what to say about this one.  I havent  been hunting it for a long time, so its something new I thought about trying to get.  Ill point out the flaws at the end of the rating.  This one was from 2004.  Smell is amazing, chocolate, raspberry, caramel, small bits of alcohol, very nice, amazing actually, the best part about the beer.  Taste is sweet, no alcohol at all, chocolate, and sweet.  Very good tasting.  Now to the bad:  first off, why is this in a 6 oz bottle?  I dont think its THAT special that they should bottle in such a small quantity.  If anything, bottle 12 oz, and produce less.  Secondly, I dont really know why this is a top 50, there are many other much better beers that are not top 50.  Hell this thing is top 10, its certainly not deserving of that spot.  Thirdly, this beer is really pricey, at 9 dollars per 6 oz.  I have a bottle, im going to age it for a long time, but once its gone I doubt this will be something I will seek out again, unless they bottle it in 750ml bottles.  Not anywhere close to NGBR.  Loses major points overall because of the price, and the small bottle, which really pissed me off.  I was expecting something equal to the greatness that is the top 10 beers here, and I found something that is about in the top 200.

499,"2006-06-30",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2008 Woo hoo, Bert! What a kind beer buddy. 2004 vintage, appearance was burgundy brown with no head and lots of sedimentation floating around (mmmmm, good). The aroma was rich raspberry and rich chocolate, smelled like raspberry black chocolate cake, fine godiva chocolates. Flavor was chocolate and lightly tart strong raspberries. Definitely not cloying sweet, really quite nice, a great evening sipper if only it was more available. Mouthfeel was silky smooth, full, very nice. This is a great beer to experience. Re-rate, 2007 vintage in Mar 08, bottle from the generous Styles: Certainly a very nice production, but not quite as rich and decadent as the first time, caramel notes certainly playing a much larger role, the chocolate a little bit less over the top, raspberries, though, still present, assertive, and highly enjoyable. Alcohol also more detectable this time through. Quite drinkable, far from cloying, very nice product. Numbers would probably come out more like a 4.0 this time around.

Tastes a bit like a ""chambord"" or after dinner sweet-sour liquer, but with a good, robust maltiness supporting it.  strength and flavorfulness of a barleywine.

I will not however that the first bottle (the big really limited edition bottles) where much more complex then the smaller bottles, maybe it was extra aging, im not sure. The smaller bottles seemed much more tart with a  much stronger raspberry taste. The larger bottles had a intense complexity of caramel, vannilla, raspberry, chocolate, malted milk balls, and breadiness. Both were insanely smooth. I will rate this on the big bottle sample cause it got the higher score, but I will say both were incredible.

499,"2006-06-08",3.9,"2004 bottle.  Not easy getting all that wax off the top, but built some anticipation anyway.  From the first phhhssst of the cap I could smell the beer.  It poured out a dark brown with really quite lively carbonation (thin streams of tiny bubbles) and a surprisingly rich caramel-cream foam for its abv.  The aroma is very accomplished--it has a vintage quality but not like a 1986 Lees which is just oxidized caramel.  Rather, its like caramel melting in a wood pot, with some raspberry toffee, partially dessicated oranges, vanilla, and tootsie rolls (cheap chocolate candy) thrown into the mix.  The palate is rich enough, coating my lips with stickiness, but theres a lot of carbonation, too.  The flavor is fine, though I can see how it doesnt turn everyone on.  I had a chocolate raspberry cake today actually (for my 35th birthday, happy birthday to me!), and that may have reached a little bit better balance of the two; the raspberries here are very subtle, amid a dense caramel-chocolate, rum-raisin (you said it Tad), and a slightly toasty toffee, like a creme brulee.  Extremely drinkable, not tasting anywhere near 10.6%, though by 2/3rds through my bottle Ive had enough for one sitting and would prefer to go on to something else, like a port perhaps.  Very nice beer, though in the sweet, fruity, high alcohol category I think there are a lot of other beers and drinks (fine ports and meads) that clearly surpass this in my enjoyment category.

499,"2006-06-06",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2011 In short: A big chocolaty and fruity (NOT tart raspberries) beer.  Uniquely decadent.
How: Bottle 180ml.  Many times.  Waxed and unwaxed bottes from the original 2004 and a few bottles from the 2007 release.
The look: Dark ruby body with almost no head
In long: The decadent nose is bakery chocolate and blackberries.  Just smelling it is 200 calories right there. Taste is a slice of extra rich chocolate cake, blackberries, fresh artisanal truffles, raspberries, blueberry pie.  Based on the name one would expect tart raspberries but fruity character of the beer is wider than that and certainly not tart.  Alcohol remains mostly well hidden body.  Carbonation is minimal.  This is a beer that can age.  Especially the waxed-top 2004 vintages.  If anything, the best bottles I ever had were the 2004 vintages drank in 2010.

Its a candy we have here in the states around Halloween.  ANyway it smells just like it!  Very interesting.  The flavor does have some tartness from the berries and that does a good job of balancing the tootsie roll and candy corn sweetness.  Oh yeah, it tastes like tootsie rolls, too.  Great beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","DewBrewer"
499,"2006-05-22",4.3,"Dark inviting brown red body with a minimal head. Smells of raspberry, molasses, alcohol, more raspberries. I pictured a very red river while drinking this. There should be a warning on this warning how damn good this is and good it makes a man feel. Damn this is smooth and full of flavor. A nice roast raspberry flavor and a clean. I dont know what you are drinking, but this is probably better. I am shocked at how good this is.

It could have used some more lacing and head... i never got to see what color it was... although the carbonation was very nice. Adding to the taste is a nice oak and smoked but smooth lingering in the palate. It could be one of my favorite brews, but i only got a few sips of it. Dont know why they make it so small? Maybe its strategy to leave you wanting more? It worked. Thanks again to Hanz for sharing.","tijuana, MEXICO","alafito"
499,"2006-05-16",4.3,"6.3 oz bottle 2004 vintage.  I would like to celebrate this 1700th rating to Sprinkle and Beerprincess for their recent engagement.  Sprinkle gave me the bottle in a quick trade about 4 months ago and now i finally got to open this fine little jem of a brew.  Thanks a ton Mike!  Chestnut hue with a small off-white foam around the rim of the snifter.  Beer has a fine haze with some light particulates floating around (i may have poured too much, but with 6.3 oz, i didnt want to waste any!  Nose has a wonderful combination of chocolate, vineous notes, lightly oxidized caramel malt,  port wine, tannens, and lots of dark berry sweetness.  very complex and so much going on here.  not any alcohol noticible on the nose.  WOW, now thats a bombardment on the mouth-a conglomerent of chocolate, dark berries, lots of caramel sweetness , red grapes, sweet molassas, with some wine-like sourness.  I dont think there is anything else that tastes like this.  Finish has quite a bit of alcohol, but is somewhat covered by the wallop of sweet berry notes.  finish also displays a vineous-french cask-like quality on the mouthfeal and flavor.  I think the alcohol is more present that what alot of raters here think it is.  its quite evident in the finish.  This brew has a ton of aging potential.  I would have to say im overwhelmed by this beer-such alot going on and with a very little sample, its hard to get all the flavors here.  there is truely nothing else like this.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

Flavor is earthly raspberry, dry and biding with a heavy vinous touch and a warming alcohol note. Notes of dark fruits. Very different and not like anything I have tasted before.

I was anxious to seek the comparison.  Bottle, 2004.  Poured a translucent--but barely--reddish brown.  Well...the aroma rocks.  Yes, I love raspberries so the bias is clear.  On top of that I really like the choco-malt latching on to that raspberry edge.  I agree with the ""liqueur"" comparison others have stated...boy this is something.  If I had a gripe (I really dont), Id say the sweetness is more than I care for, but heck I can live with it.  Full bodied, nice warming alcohol tinge....very yummy.

I believe that this is my first perfect 10 for aroma. I could just linger over the smell for hours. Flavor is well balanced with the caramelly chocolate sweetness up front and the raspberry tart sliding in ever so subtly and taking over towards the finish. Extremely smooth and completly beguiling you into thinking nothing of the high alcohol potency of this gem. Warming in the belly giving a sort of toasty air although I feel it more than taste it. What a masterpiece of a beer. I would say that fruit beers are not my style of choice but this beer lives up to its hype and then some.

Update July 2 2008. I opened one of my 2004 bottles, and the aroma has faded, and this beer is starting to taste stale and vinegary. Sadly, this bottling has lost its mojo. Drink before they decline any further.  SEPTEMBER 2009-I sampled at the GABF, and this is drinking surprisingly well. However, its still not as good as the 2004 before it got stale (about 18-24 months). Its good, but what it lacks from the 2004 is the dark chocolate flavors, and the finish is not quite as complex. What it tastes like now is what my friend at GABF described as raspberry filling in a chocolate cake.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
499,"2006-03-11",4.5,"2004 Vintage Bottle.  Where do I begin with this one?  Sitting here looking at the bottle, I find it hard to get past the aura of the home-looking label and the midieval wax seal and just open the bottle.  I finally give in, and get out a champagne flute given to me as a wedding gift.  Hazy, caramely red coloring with a thin, light toasted ring of head.  Wow, the aroma is fantastic!  Im really excited now.  In addition to the raspberries, my nostrils are warmed by sweet caramel, Christmas flavored coffee, vanilla bean, and a dried strawberry aroma that can only be found in a breakfast cereal box.  The vinous qualities found in this brew give this beer a multitude of character.  A pleasant toasted oakiness combines with the mildly tart berry dimensions, giving it a wonderful balance between sweet, tart, and dryness.  A simidgen of bittersweet chocolate interrupts my ponderings.  Oh my gosh, Im enjoying this drink as an apertif to desert, and I saved a bit for the strawberries and cream I was waiting to enjoy.  What a glorious accompaniment to the fresh fruit!  I thought this beer was marvelous on a clean palate, but its even better when washing down the sweet strawberry sugars.

The second time I stick my nose in Im more prepared to be amazed, I can concentrate on the different elements, there is chocolate, raspberries and caramel, the alcohol is barely noticeable. A third sniff reveals something close to plums or grapes. Ok, enough chit-chat, lets taste this marvel ! Wow, Im astonished, bewildered, amazed, in love. The flavor has an extremely balanced and harmonious blend of chocolate, caramel and raspberries. Again Im reminded of grapes, but now its more like candied grapes.

Strange how damn small this bottle is, I mean make a great beer and bottle it in a size that hardly fills a bathroom cup, thankfully after the anticipation that is the only complaint. Pours out a nice deep brown color that is clear. Slight lacing on the top, but hardly a head to speak of. Aroma is of brown sugar, caramel and some brandy. Taste is nice and complex with some notes of the raspberry, but not over powering. Caramel malts dominate the taste, but it has a nice finish and palate to it. A very good beer.","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"

HUGE chocolate malt aroma with ample sweet raspberry notes. Muddy amber in color with no real head. Big blast of chocolate and raspberry. Tastes like a raspberry truffle indeed. Matta mentioned Captain Crunch (while we tasted it) and I get that too. Its so damn tasty its hard to believe it isnt just a raspberry chocolate puree. There are mild caramel hints, but this mostly just a chocolate/raspberry party. I cant detect any alcohol in it just smooth tasty goodness.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

499,"2006-01-27",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2006 This 2004 release was obtained in a trade with BA CRJMellor, the Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock came in a waxed green bottle in an unusual size of 6.3 oz. Scraping off the wax was rather easy with a knife. The beer came out dark red in color, with very fizzy carbonation head like a soda pop. The smell was a blend of chocolate and raspberry, and reminded me very much of gourmet dark chocolate truffles that I sample around Christmas. Taste was very much like reminiscent of those truffles as well, with melted dark chocolate blended with raspberry syrup. Rum, maple syrup, and vanilla, and coffee were some of the other flavors that came to mind while sipping the beer. Alcohol was medicinal, and hops herbal in nature. Aftertaste was peppery sharp, and prevented the beer from getting too sweet. Smooth and slick mouthfeel also advanced the impression of richness. A very unique beer that has little to do with flavors typically associated with other beers, and is closer in flavor profile to a pudding or a cake. Viva le difference!","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
499,"2006-01-24",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2006 Bottled 2004.  Pours with no head really.  A good swirl gets a thin tan layer of foam that disappears quick.  Some haze to its red/amber color.  Aroma is sweet smelling candy raspberries or maybe more like strawberry, big malts, smells like a fruity barley wine.  Flavor is fairly different from the aroma.  A good amount of chocolate and caramel flavors are present.  Very distinct raspberry flavors and some other stuff going on that I cant really put into words.  Overall its pretty sweet, kinda sticky cloying.  Whether its 10.6% or the previously listed 18% I dont know, either way theres not much alcohol in the flavor or aroma, besides the way it makes your chest feel when you swallow.  Its very decent, I must admit.  Overall #5 good?  Nah, I dont think so.  Somewhat disappointing.  Thanks for the bottle Styles.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"
499,"2006-01-23",4.6,"A dainty little bottle, which seems appropriate for a slow sipping beer like this. Coppery brown when I look at it from the side of the glass, but from the top there are some nice red highlights. A faint skim of light head. Surprisingly little alcohol smell. Subtly sweet raspberry cheesecake. Further layers of angel-food cake, vanilla, dried cherries, roses and leather. The aroma builds and opens as it warms. Profound, deep, melting chocolate-like creaminess, followed by smooth raspberry preserves. An earthy, toasty munich-malt encapsulates the whole, giving cohesiveness to the talented individual components, and never letting your mouth forget that this is beer. A bit of sour cherry in the finish as the flavor evolves. Thick, velvet-smooth palate. A truly memorable tasting.

499,"2006-01-16",4.0,"(6.3 oz bottle, 2004 vintage  drank in January 2006)  Poured a hazy deep red/brown beer with a rather large dark foamy head with great retention. Aroma of raspberry chocolate cake is quite evident with some port-like alcohol sensation. Taste is less sweet then expected as well as raspberry, which I had expected to be more dominant. Instead there is strong chocolate and caramel malt with a semi-sweet ending. Did not fit my expectation but is still very good nonetheless. I would now be very curious to try the raspberry-free eisbock.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
499,"2006-01-16",4.2,"(6.3oz bottle, 2004, many thanks Pailhead) Small tan head atop a clear blood-red body.  Aroma is moderately sweet, raspberry, fig, toffee, some chocolate, cookie dough, cherry.  Taste is a liquid chocolate fudge brownie accented by raspberry, cherry and caramel.  Low carbonation in the moderately full body that holds the alcohol incredibly well.

I pick up a little of that candy corn nose that others have noted, but I wouldnt have noticed it otherwise.  The flavor is sweet and chocolately, followed by some tart raspberry flavor.   The alcohol content is pretty much completely hidden.  Very smooth texture, somewhat full bodied, and a nice long finish that reminds me of rich chocolate cake covered in raspberry syrup.

The chocolate and caramel stick through on the taste, now coupled with strong caramel.  The caramel and raspberry did not mix in a way I found particularly appealing and left some sort of strange twang on the aftertaste.  I could get by it.

An explosion of freshly-pressed raspberries escaped almost before the cap was lifted.  Rich, toasty chocolate and caramel were not far behind... along with sweet alcohol esters and darker spices.  Aroma opened up more and more as the brew approached room temperature.  This was absolutely decadent from the first touch on the lips through the long satisfying finish.  Fresh raspberries imbued both sweet and tart notes, both intricately laced throughout the flavor... complemented by dark, Swiss chocolates, chewy caramel, spices (nutmeg and vanilla), and a hint of floral.  No flavor dominated, and I cant think of a flavor aspect that wouldve made this better.  So very smooth across the palate... with some mild graininess distributing the multitude of flavors to the proper taste buds.

499,"2005-12-23",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2008 2004. A fiery west coast sunset of burning orange and rose, fading into a deeply hued crimson and garnet. Rimmed gracefully with a gentle edge of tan. Bold flow of fresh concord grapes, sour aged raisins, hewn oak and gentle nutmeg spice, rubbed and pressed fresh roadside raspberries marry with the gentle warm fusels of aged port. Gentle copper kettle caramel sifts through the fruit, rising to a head of freshly shaved Belgian Chocolate atop strong vinous qualities. Aroma grows and glows as a warming intoxication with many levels, from a seductive exotic musky spice to a gentle thin order of fruits and supple fragrance. A truly delicate and graceful perfection of dancing volatiles. Flavor begins entirely unassuming with a concert of gentle vinous, malt and reduced berry sauce, effervescently exploding across the palate. As the film begins to creep across the palate, it files the mouth with a symphony of graceful and delicate floral profusion. The flavor is not as bold and complex as I would have expected and is honestly the weakest part of this beer. Starts slowly and shows strongest in the finish, aftertaste and smack.  First, typically clean fruity malt, then an explosion of nutty and buttery raspberry, caramel and chocolate in the finish, filming the mouth with a continuous delicious delight. In the back, an utter detonation of black cherry combined with sweet fresh lime juice and a hint of zest. A heavy level of chewiness adds amazing texture, with astounding weight and body. Yet, the alcohol is deft and hidden better than any could hide it, with only a slight warming of the back of the throat to remind that this is a slightly sinister beverage. A lot of raw brown sugar, touched with molasses and the drippings of a pineapple core. In the finish, a clingingly sweet raspberry caramel, lingering to eternity. Palate is supple and silky.

Fruity raspberry and a bit of cherry.  Sweet malts, definately noticable as both carmel and chocolate, and a faint alcohol.  Sweet syrup and chocolate as well.

The aroma is sweet raspberries (though theyre somewhat restrained compared to many other beers with fruit), apples, subtle orange, caramel, dry aged chocolate, and a hint of biscuit.  The taste is dry, almost bitter raspberry (I like the no sweeteners added here very much), and a subtle chocolate that just grows and grows over the sampling.  At first the chocolate-raspberry taste takes on a light caramel note, then a light alcohol-soaked bread, a nice grainy-wheat flavor, and a hint of roasted malt and hops hidden in there barely detectable.  Medium bodied, light-medium carbonation, sweet yet not at all syrupy or sugary.  Finishes with a long drawn-out chocolate-raspberry aftertaste, highlighting the fruity qualities of the berry while still retaining some grain-like qualities of the malt.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, lighlty acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, soft/flat carbonation, lightly alcoholic. This is a far better beer to smell than it is to drink.  The nose is like a freshly baked pastry, very caramelly and chocolatey and enticing, but the mouth experience disappoints after that.  Kinda watery, with little balance for the sweetness.  This is neither rich nor decadent in the mouth experience.

The aroma is quite possibly one of the best Ive ever smelled. Rich chocolate (I know lots of us use that when describing beer, but Ive never smelled it so pure as I have here), raspberries, marshmellow creme, hint of smores and maybe even chocolate covered strawberries. Absolutely magnificent aroma. Smells like dessert to me! The taste is tart raspberries, chocolate covered strawberries, caramel, light alcohol, raspberry jam, raw sugar, and Black Forest Cake. Lots of maltiness throughout this as well. Very rich! Body is as smooth as a babys bottom! Little to no carbonation, light alcohol warmth and minimal stickiness on this beast. It wraps up with more raspberry tartness coming through - chocolate covered raspberries, more chocolate cake notes, light hints of marshmellow creme, light caramel and maybe milk chocolate. Very delicious beer! Its a shame this is so hard to get.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
499,"2005-09-26",4.1,"This beer was sampled at Pitonkatonks house to celebrate the arrival of Facto, Buck Dich and Indiana Red. This beer pours a very raspberry red color...as expected a red with hints of slight purple and magenta. There was absolutely no head or no lacing with this beer unless it was physically induced by swirling. Facto was totally correct in that the only way to truly drink this beer is to smell it for at least ten minutes. Aroma is of raspberries, chocolate and marshmellows....the sweetness and somehow mellowness of the aroma is entrancing with that slight hint of alcohol present. Oddly though, I would have expected there to be more of a pronounced alcohol aroma, but there wasnt. The flavor is noticeably full of raspberries but once again has subtle chocolate undertones and TONS of marshmellow candy sugar sweetness. Carbonation levels are held well within check. Full flavored body and so complex on many levels. The chocolate is just so subtle, but its still there and it just lingers for minutes. Definitely a beer Id take well over an hour to finish and savor. I will fully be expecting Facto to get me more of this!","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

The flavour was of raspberry port, quite sweet (not cloying), some chocolate, cherries and caramel.  Extremly complex mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation.  Finishes with a lingering raspberry sweetness.  Very well balanced, outstanding stuff.  Way to drinkable for 18%, not even a hint of alcohol.

499,"2005-09-14",4.7,"6.3oz. 2004 bottle:  There was a faint ""pffft"" when I popped the cap.  This one poured out a cloudy slightly reddish-brown color.  The head was about non-existent.  The aroma is interesting.  Definite notes of raspberry, but also a sourness to it.  Also notes of a rich maltiness and some oakiness.  It also reminds me somwwhat of a port.  The raspberries are a big part of the taste, but not overpowering.  There is an initial mild sweetness, that is followed by somewhat sour aftertaste.  There is also a bit of a thickness and silkiness to the palate.  The are also flavors of caramel and toffee in the mix.  Absolutely no taste of alcohol, which is suprising given the 18% ABV.  This is extremely nice.  Much thanks to Pailhead for this fine brew!!!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
499,"2005-09-08",3.7,"6.3oz 2004 bottle, Sampled September 2005
Pours with the faintest trace of carbonation that creates a very small ring of fine bubbles that bubble up from the etched marking at the bottom of my Duvel tulip.  The beer is a hazy amber-red color that shows a thin wispy tan head when roused.  The aroma is thick with raspberries, but there is a rich malty note to it that stops it from becoming pure raspberry.  As I go in for a deeper smell of the aroma the rich maltiness of this beer becomes much more apparent.  My nose has become used to the raspberry note and I now get rich concentrated notes of caramel, toffee, and a toasty maltiness underneath the dominant raspberry note.  Actually the more I think about it the more it seems to smell like a raspberry flavored chocolate malt ball.

The beer is quite thick on the palate, yet it is not nearly as sweet as I was expecting.  There is some sweetness here but it is malty sweet as opposed to the typical sugary sweetness that I was expecting.  The thing that really lingers on the palate after the beer has been swallowed is the rich concentrated maltiness; notes of toffee and toasted biscuits.  Because of the relative dryness of this beer, the raspberry flavor is not allowed to dominate as much as it could.  The raspberry is certainly noticeable, but it is not too overwhelming.  Actually after my first sip of this I was sorely disappointed the flavors just seemed to clash, and were quite jarring.  It got better with subsequent sips though.  The maltiness, as in the aroma, really reminds me of chocolate malt balls, definitely interesting.

Despite my first impression, I am definitely enjoying this beer.  It is not cloying, like the New Glarus beers, and the raspberry notes are not overwhelming.  In fact they are in a good balance with the rest of the beer.  All of the flavors are concentrated and over-the-top, but none of them are out of whack with the rest of the beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I have aged it as long as I can, it has been in my cellar since late May. 6.3oz bottle with a pretty wax covering. Served at 69° in my NB worthy glass. The color is deep, dark red that borders on brown. The smallish head dies away quickly. There are striations of suspended particles throughout the beer. The smell is killer, it seeks you out. I am typing and am 1.5 from the beer and still I smell it. When I get my nose down there it is most predominantly raspberries (of course) , but there are notes of prunes, caramelized turbinado sugar,  grape must, flowers?, and a smell reminiscent of cognac/brandy, not sure if it is the alcohol, if so, it is not abrasive at all. The mouthfeel is huge, almost like a syrup. The flavors are complex caramel, raspberry, strawberry, vanilla, yeast, tart citrus, the flavor is reminiscent of a raspberry liquor. Almost not too different from the spiced black raspberry liquor, Chambord, mixed with a caramelly dopplebock (might have to try that???). This would be heaven with a rich, chocolate dessert!

499,"2005-08-14",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2006 Poured by Eric Kuhnhenn (who didnt seem too happy at the moment) at the Great Taste of the Midwest, Madison, 8/13/2005. One of the finest aromas Ive ever had from a beer. All the goodness of scotch and raspberries envelops ones nostrils. The nose had me excited, perhaps too much so. (I had a similar experience with the Creme Brulee Stout. Incredible nose, but not as impressive on the palate.) It reminded me of Chambord on the palate a bit, combined with more oak and butter toffee. This was good stuff, but not the #2 beer in the world. Luckily, I was able to procure two bottles to store away for a few years. I think this will improve with cellaring. 
ReRating after sampling from bottle. Im upping the palate 2 points, but sticking with my overall 16/20 and 7/10 for flavor. I realized last night that Im just not a big fan of raspberry and white chocolate, and it was the white chocolate note that bugged me last night. If youre a fan of raspberry white chocolate cheesecake, I know of no better beer for you. ANOTHER RERATE: 2004 bottle. Aging puts on more notes of chocolate, and Im finding Im liking this less and less.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

11026 hook me up with a bottle, has to be one of the best wedding presents we recieved.  The wife and I opened this while camping in Washington, after a great day spent at the beach.  Has a tan head on top of a purple and deep red body.  Amazing complexity in the aroma: bourbon, creamed raspberries, cherries, sweet (but not hot) alcohol, oak, peaches and fruit seeds, very husky and hearty aroma.  Amazingly rich and sweet up front, full of wood, tart raspberries and pie (think cobler), some brandy and graham cracker.  Warms the throat and stomach, to me it felt a little like heartburn but just about anything gives me heartburn anyways.  Rich mocha and woody fruits in the finish, rich and hot at the end.  A wonderful beer, hype confirmed!


2004 bottles sampled in early 2008 (3+ years aged)
Looksjust as wonderful as any bottle of KRE, but its fully consumed in oxidation.  Generally nothing left in the nose but a hiuge, heavy dose of wet cardboard and dogfood, and only the faintest, most stale raspeberry flavor is left.  Pretty disappointing.  A fresh 2007 bottle was opened at the same time, and it was on par as the fresh 2007 from draft, rated below.


2007 vintage on draft at Kuhnhenns
Seems to float in the glass without much presence, no head, not much in the way of legs or lacing.  The raspberry note is very nice, very fruity, pulpy, not overly sweet or candied, but the chocolate seems weak/thin, and doesnt match the richness of the 2004 bottle.  It doesnt effect my numbers at all, and I hope to drink the 2004 again with about 4 years on it, and the 2007 with at least one to get a better sence of how this beer ages.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

499,"2005-08-01",4.3,"Small bottle into Duvel tulip.  Sampled at Stuffed Sandwich, San Gabriel CA, courtesy of cquiroga and his mad trading skillz.  Smell is freshly picked raspberries over milk and dark chocolate and musty cookies.  Dark yellowish brown in the glass with a thin tan head that mostly diminishes.  Lots of sediment.  Looks really viscous.  Silky melted chocolate and alcohol at first in the mouth, and then the raspberry explodes at the beginning of the finish and lingers a long time with alcohol numbing both sides of the tounge.  The finish gets a bit dry late and astringent.  For 18%, the alcohol is incredibly hidden.  Women would call this ""sinful.""  Theres a bit of a grainy feel in the finish, and an acid tang.  Beneath the rich, deep melted chocolate in the full mouth are some portish dark fruits like plums, right before the raspberry kicks in and dominates.  This packs one of the most intense flavor and mouthfeel punches Ive ever experienced.  Im officially a Kuhnhenn groupie now, I think.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Welcoming chocolate and vegetal tones wouldnt fit together in any other beer, but the acid character, the woody nature and the truffle richness appear like they all came from the same tree. Plenty of raspberries underlying flavors, but the alcohol is the big loser, nowhere to be seen which is most impressive. Slight oiliness on the palate, medium bodied, moderately carbonated. Strong presence in mouth, less fruity, possibly less acid than expected, a nice acetic backbone remains subtle, woody, though you have the impression that the tartness grows from sip to sip.

Reddish-brown orange with a very thin white ring.  Aroma is sour and malty with a blast of potent raspberry.

Buttery rhubarb with bready crumble and puffed pastry. Whipping cream infused with soft salt cured lemon zest. Mildly astringent.

After nearly a year and 5 months the raspberry has dropped out a lot. Chocolate and Madiera have really picked up in the pronounced nose and overall flavour of the beer. Aging doesnt seem to be a problem. I am wondering if the alcohol content is being reported shorter than it used to be (around 18%). It packs quite a kick, but as far as I can remember it was higher than the 10.6%abv on 061105. Gorgeous beer.

499,"2005-07-14",4.5,"I have been fortunate enough to have this beauty on draft (release party 05) and in bottles (most recently 7/12/05). Poured a deep redddish brown with plenty of unfiltered goodness, topped nicely by a caramel head. Aromas were strong of sweet raspberrys and fruit, along with vanilla, caramel and hints of chocolate. Flavors reminded me of the chocolate covered fruit candies. Alcohol is masked very well here, and the mouthfeel is almost velvety.

This beer rocks! Mahogany lager with a small, creamy well-tanned head. Raspberry cobbler dripping with rich, milk chocolate sauce; toffee, butterscotch. All things malty, fruity and rich fill my nose. Chocolate-raspberry sauce coats the tongue while my face is lightly slapped with warm, fruity alcohol. Full-bodied and syrupy with light carbonation.

499,"2005-07-12",4.7,"Beautiful cocoa head, deep magenta hue, edging on brown...looks like a bockish brown, but shows crimson aspects, as well.
Vast aromatics...cream & cognac....angelic...sweetness, light and lively, matched with the power of booze. Raspberry flavor is shy at first, but peeks out eventually (in aroma and taste)...
...which is where were going next...tastes like brandy at first, until raspberry slips through, under the coat of çognac...and the result is utterly unheard of ...a graceful, powerful thing, some nuts, chocolate charge the palate elegantly...a sublime sipper and a rich elixir, all at once.
After further examination, ""absolutely gorgeous"" is good as I can get, for now...uncanny, this balance, this magnificent marriage, and this perfect play of flavors, that harmonizes to create a gentle blend that delivers a rare, unheard-of experience in the flavor, and all throught the experience.
Fantastic balance: never too strong, too dark, too rich, just right...slick, yet graceful, not sickly, not treacly, somehow just the perfect match of a strong dark lager and the raspberry flavor, with enchanting yeast...a magical match of cookie + fruit + liquor.
Theres a slight bite, a bit of hops, then all is mellow, you never really feel the 13%, its a sly, subtle sophisticated combination.
Full-bodied, yet not fulsome, and wholly memorable. Unique among beers, this has a flavor and a transcendent effect not felt in many other beers.
They did their work well at Kuhnhenn, and crafted a masterpiece...a $30 bottle masterpiece, though? Ehhh???
Definitely a special occasion beer, and after-dinner dessert brew, only for revelling and toasting, something to mellow the mood and usher in an unheard of feeling among all in company...not an any-old-day beer, by any means.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

The raspberrys greet you immediately upon opening, fresh smelling and then chocolate coated, interesting to say the least. A small hint of alcohol is apparent also. The body is almost full, lightly creamy, i was expecting a bit more body especially with this big an alc. content. Plenty of chocolate and raspberries on the palate, lightly sweet and fruity, notes of cocoa and bittersweet chocolate with a mild sourness, black patent?

499,"2005-07-01",4.5,"Bottle #34 - Purply blackened brown cola color. Light brownish spongy cap of thin proportions creeps and keeps to the edges. Some oily spotty lacing glazes the glass.

Aroma is of a raspberry tootsie pop. A nice sweet display of sugared candy raspberry and tootsie rolls. Keeps a highly sweetened dough of fresh white bread among the crystalized sugary topping.

Taste is more blackberry-like then raspberry, fruity and berry loaded, the raspberry is there with its souring tart along with a sugared candy tartness and sweetness mixing and melding together with some interesting Rolo-like chocolate and caramel. Perhaps some strawberry, kiwi, and nectarine juices have been squeezed in. Quite sweet and candyish with a calmer tone of soda pop-like sugar and character. Succulent fresh bread dough keeps an extra thick backing into the chocolate tones which are blended in with a really sophisticated placement and slick texture.

Feel is pretty lively and thickly set with smoothened sweet tart tones and no sticky stuff. Swift, dank, and stuffy yet holds a uniquely refreshing cool briskness. Big time sugared candy impressions are left after each sip. Subtle dryness in the finish with feathery chocolate richness. Its the liquid version of a Tootsi pop. The 13.5% is never evident in any of the character, but definately hits with an after effect of sleepyness. 

At $30 a 500ml bottle this is one spendy, trendy treat to save for special occasions or for a dessert drink after fancy dinners.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

The beer pours a dark murkey ever-so slightly rubied brown color with a complete lack of head. The nose is incredible. Dark fruity and chocolate tones ride below a very intense, but not fake raspberry. Wow. Intense. DAMN. The flavors are huge. Syrupy raspberry sweetness and tartness hit upfront, assaulting my tastebuds. This moves to a slight chocolate and fig, but the raspberry is so big, its harder to find the subtleties. The brew is huge and thick and syrupy. Wow. Overall, this beer is in a league of its own. For one, the alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor or the aroma. Its not even overly warming after drinking it. The flavors are big and lingering, leaving me craving the next sip. I have to pause between sips, but it keeps me craving more. This is an experience I will not forget. Everything about this beer is intense, minus the alcohol presence. Very, very good.","Tennessee, USA","kmpitz2"

Maybe its raspberry compote and butter on toasted homemade bread. Just amazing.  Smooth raspberry flavors meld with milky, red wine notes.

The aroma is as good coming from this as any Ive tried. Im still smelling it in my mind the next day. Really heady stuff here!
Deep dark brown color, with a diminished head expected of an Eisbock. Almost laces.
Complex flavor is perfectly balanced between the raspberry and the maltiness of the Eisbock. The raspberry strikes me for its naturalness. So many fruit beers taste artificial and not at all like the fruit from which they supposedly come, not this one. Buttered toast with raspberry jam! The raspberry is not too tart, not too sweet, just perfect! No medicinal notes at all as high alcohol beers utilizing fruits can have.  The overall sweetness of the brew is also near perfect, playing back and forth between the malt and the fruit as it works towards an incredibly long and satisfying finish. Not cloying, not sour, just perfect! The alcohol content is completely masked in this. This easily jumps into my top ten list as one of those beers that make you say WOW! You only taste beers like this every once in a long while and it makes tasting all of those regular beers in between worth it when you get one like this!

The second the seal on the cap is broken a wonderful raspberry aroma begins to waft through the air. Lovely murky brown-reddish pour. Frothy light mocha head. Light weeping lace. The aroma just gets better as it is poured. Sweet rich raspberry with cocoa, pancakes covered in butter and maple syrup, all eaten in a field late in the fall with light organic decay permeating the air. Astounding aroma. Cant stop sniffing, my head is getting light. Interestingly I am not detecting the faintest whiff of alcohol in the aroma. Ok finally on to the taste. Another big wow, raspberries, but not over the top and not at all raspberry syrupy tasting. The cocoa is still here and the lager yeast really starts to shine through. Sweet but never cloying. Alcohol never detracts and lends a pleasant numbing effect to the affair. Full bodied with assertive carbonation up front then it softens and just glides down your throat.

The taste is raspberries with bourbon and slight oak. This has a dry white wine finish. Very well done and not in your face like some other fruit beers.

So I had to see for myself, thanks to Sully for opening on up this weekend.  Poured a cloudy red/pink body with a light diminshing pinkish head.  Aroma was of raspberry first and fore most, with hints of milk chocolate, other tart fruits (cherries maybe), sugar/honey.  Flavor  wasnt overly sweet, with raspberries allowing other flavors to take part as well, chocolate was especially memorable.  At 18% alcohol, I was surprised not to taste a single bit of it.  The bugs, if there were any originally have definately been worked out and what worked has been improved upon.



2002, Bottle:  Was able to split a bottle with a friend while talking beer at the brewery.  After letting it warm up for 20 minutes or so I took a whiff and was impressed.  Having had bad experiances with fruit experiments like this one I was preparing myself for another let down.  I was mildly impressed.  Strong raspberry mixed in with chocolate.  Could stand to lose some of the sweetness.  Overall a good beer, but a better experiance.

No head means no lacing either.  Well, the body was a semi-opaque dark brown color with no visible carbonation.  The aroma was strongly vinous and malty.  The mouth feel was not noted, but the flavor was that of dark malts raisins molasses and only a very mild raspberry scent.  Interesting flavor and very different from other brews.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
499,"2004-05-16",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2005 Re-rate from 2004 6.3 oz bottle.I sampled this as part of a tasting before but wanted to try it again on a fresh palate, and my impression of this beer changed.  Caramely brown body with red hints, topped by a quickly dissipating light tan head.  Caramely, pruney, raisiny aroma, heavy on the doppelbock characteristics, and notes of raspberry (but not dominant, as I found before).  Very toasty body, lots of prune and raisin, with the somewhat tart raspberries really coming through most strongly in the finish and amazing aftertaste.  Caramel and chocolate finishes off the raspberries at the end of the sip.  There arent many beers that ""warm up"" to a delicious finish, but this is one of those.  Very softly carbonated.  I didnt pick up all of this complexity the first time around, which may be due to a fresher palate (this time) or a different product.Previous rating:Jim (flemdawg) was kind enough to bring a rare bottle of this Eisbock to Fort Wayne.  Poured a ruddy orange/red-brown, with nary a bubble, achieving a very ""syrupy"" look in the glass.  Aroma was very, very strong raspberry, with a touch of caramel and toast.  Extremely tart and full-flavored, dominated by quality raspberry (of course) and some toast and caramel, although the raspberry clearly dominates the palate.  A rich, rich beverage.  13% ABV?  I wouldnt have guessed it.  I really enjoyed this beverage, but hesitate to rate it too highly, as the ""beer"" aspect of this Eisbock is really drowned out by the delicious raspberries (8-3-8-4-15).","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
499,"2004-05-09",4.7,"Dang yo! An incredible beer would be an understatment.  Thanks to walleye for bringing his bottle to the Fort to share.  Lets start with the aroma shall we?  A big hit of raspberry perserves, then there was molasses raisns and a hint of alcohol, at 13% this was no suprise.  Dark brown body with a minute tan ring of bubbles around the edge and almost no lacing at all.  And now the taste.  Ooooh doggie!  Rapberries for all and throw in some cholotae and malts to make it all good.  The alcohol was masked superbly and I would have had to really try to find it in the taste.  Such a smooth brew as well.  So very easy to drink it might be illegal.  With out thinking about it, I could easily but down 4 or 5 before I would realize what I was doing.  I heard that walleye got the last two bottles, say it aint so!","Rowlett, Texas, USA","flemdawg"
499,"2004-05-09",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2006 another rerate here. had this on 12/08/06  at the brewery, this stuff keeps getting better and better my 3rd number 5 rating.RE-RATE 5/7/06 ON TAP AS JTW SAID ONE NIGHT ONLY  BUT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 6.3 OZ BOTTLES THIS ONE WAS DIFFERANT THAN THE 1ST ABV IS NOW 18%.

Did I say WOW","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","walleye"
499,"2004-01-25",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2005 Historic Batch #1 brewed in 2002.  What a great time at the brewery. Bret Kuhnhenn went in to his cellar and pulled a bottle out for me to try.  Man was this stuff incredible.  Aroma is pure heaven.  Perfect ripe red raspberry jam aroma, sticky, sweet, boisterous. Wow.  This is one of the most drinkable beers Ive ever had. I had to restrain myself from downing it in just a few sips.  Big sweet raspberry flavor meets lovely dark dark chocolate malt.  Huge body on it and wonderfully wedded are the raspberries and malt.  Alcohol is nowhere to be found.  The more it warmed, the more I was able to explore the flavors hiding behind the raspberries.  Dark, dry chocolate, vanilla, and almost a nuttiness that I cant put my finger on.  Exceptional.  I went home and had a Kulmbacher Eisbock that night, and the magic of the Kulmbacher seemed paled after trying Kuhnhenns gem.  The fact that they were able to successfully brew a beer of this magnitude with raspberries is very impressive.Batch #2 brewed in late 2004.  Already oxidized, lightly so, and not in a bad way.  The beer has a rich, thick body, but yet a very big lack of carbonation protests that this be a syrupy, cloying monster.  So score one for oxidation.  It also adds to the lovely sherry-like flavor of the beer.  A gentle, sweet sipper, with abounding complexity and by no means outdone or overdone with raspberries.  The malt is soothing, rich and sweet, but yet the beer is balanced so nicely with honey, caramel and rich chocolate.  Its a shame that these bottles come so small.  Quite a bit different from the first batch, much less raspberry influence, less thick chcolate and much less thick of a body.  Perhaps thats just the oxidation from the bottle size.  I hope I can try it on draught or from the 500mL bottle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
499,"2003-08-14",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2003 Nose, I tell you, NOSE!!! This thing was unique!  We've all had dozens of boring brewpub raspberry wheats with nose of fresh berries and flat taste.  This nose was a wild romp through a berry patch that detoured through a Starbucks, past the blueberry patch, and along the border of a chocolate factory hard at work in full production.  Maple was there, too, seemingly holding at all together at it's bursting seams.  All the bock sweetness seemed mapley and massive rushes of raspberry and blueberry ran down the sides of my tongue. Hot, firey alcohol followed the fresh/sour/tart/sweet tastes all the way to my gut.  This is a big beer. Luckily, I'm all about the big stuff!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
499,"2003-07-28",4.3,"At MBG Summer Fest: Got in line with Josh to try this unique beer. Oily brown with reddish highlights. Wow what a aroma, tart raspberry on top of sweet bock. Nose hints of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and wood. Taste of raspberries dipped in chocolate while drinking an turkish coffee. Great balance, who would have guessed. Smooth and luscious mouthfeel without becoming sticky. The best find at the fest. Good luck finding it, it was a lucky ""mistake"". If they do choose to attempt this again, it would be highly recommended.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
499,"2003-07-28",4.0,"Red-tinged dark brown.  Aroma of raspberry, toffee, chocolate and a little alcohol.  Thick, silky, with all good things dark malt showing up – toffee and liquorice.  Quite rich, like the best Belgian dark chocolate.  This is cut by sweet & sour raspberry notes.  This is very drinkable.  I’d love to taste the eisbock straight-up sometime.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
