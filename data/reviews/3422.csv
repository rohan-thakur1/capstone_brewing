3422,"2013-10-29",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2014 Bottle  again, thanks to Steve_0 for being an awesome trustee! Aroma is dominated by funky leather, earth, damp wood. Once the beer breathes more delicate tart fruit starts to come through. Seedy Raspberry, tart cherry, and a hint of rye bread. The beer is dark in color with reddish hues, very effervescent, and has sporadic lacing. Taste is immediately raspberry with a nice mix of wood and pie crust. The longer the beer sits on the tongue the more sour it becomes. There is a slight booze flavor, and good amount of alcohol spice and warmth. The beer has high carbonation and with an extremely dry finish. The finish is plenty sour.. Opened up 2 bottles a few months apart. Some age has done this wonders and the tart fruit really shines.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3422,"2013-10-27",3.8,"Bottle - thanks Felipe! Pours cloudy mahogany, small tan head and some lacing. Aroma is very Bretty and fruity, raspberry, cocoa. Flavor is medium to very tart, lightly sweet with a bone dry finish. Vinous and oaky, light astringence. Medium body, high carbonation levels lead to an almost offputting amount of effervescence in the mouth, but this dies down as the beer breathes.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3422,"2013-10-18",4.2,"375mL thanks to Shmeal! Pours a full haze, cola brown with higher mocha foam. Webby, tan lacing. Nose is dark raspberry, chocolate cake drizzle, raspberry reduction sauce. Taste is very lactic, huge citric lime bite. Huge leather, salty and bright. Crooked Stave has this massive citric/lactic thing going on. In a way I wish it was less sour and allow the dark raspberry beer to shine through more. Still, this one was absolutely fantastic.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3422,"2013-10-15",4.5,"Bottle share by Greg, Aroma is just pure fresh muddled raspberries. Tastes is like a raspberry puree, tartness builds.","Farmington, Minnesota, USA","XmnwildX12"
3422,"2013-10-11",4.2,"375 ml bottle shared by Mark- thanks again! Bottled September 2013. Pours a deep, hazy, rich purple-amber with some small bubbles and film atop the beer. Huge raspberry in the aroma, with oak, florals, oak, bourbon, leather, and faint vinegar. Flavor of sweet and tart raspberries, tart grapes, oak, brown sugar, bourbon, and chocolate. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sour mouthfeel. More tartness than expected, but balanced by a big, rich character. Excellent.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
