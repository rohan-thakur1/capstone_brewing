1447,"2016-11-30",3.3,"On tap @ Rising Tide. Amber in color with some off-white foam. Not as overly sweet as a lot of altbiers, probably a variety of reasons for that... Some caramel and toasted bread, certainly. Has more of a hop character than I typically expect from altbier, but again, not necessarily a surprise. Has some floral and almost earthy notes. Finishes kind of bitter, but in between theres a very obvious estery, fruity quality.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1447,"2015-05-15",3.6,"Draught and bottles, since debut, most recently April 2015.Clear copper-goldenrod body is topped by a small, off-white head that is mostly well-retained.Toasty malt with flowers, light spices and some earthiness in the nose proclaim a pretty honorable rendition of the ""traditional alt"". Yes, theres acidity and citrus here as well, but its light and helps take some of the intensity from the toasted malt sourness. No alcohol or flaws, very clean and fruity.The munic malt does its usual thing, adding tons of sourdough flavor, but theres enough residual sugar to balance, leaving a malty caramel flavor lingering, while floral hoppiness and citrus bitterness also coalesce on the finish. Vanilla and brown bread notes are subdued and the carbonation is strong and helps clear all of this malt (both the sour and sweet) and hop bitterness.I dont love beers with a high proportion of munich malt. It just exacerbates any hop acidity with the heavy sourdough/toasted flavors and really fatigues the palate, requiring, in turn, more fatiguing sweetness to balance. That being said, they do a good job here and its still quite drinkable, especially if youre looking for a more substantial beer to go with a meal or whatnot. Again, very clean and not much to complain about.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1447,"2015-05-03",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2015 Bottle from Candia Road Convenience. Aroma is toasted bread, cereal, hop, and slightest hint of chocolate and smoke.

Palate is light to medium bodied, average texture, lightly creamy with average carbonation--lightest buzz on the tip of the tongue and wet but fairly abrupt finish with balance of sweet and mild bitterness.

The smell has a light sort of mild malts and hops with a light cooked apples and an added sort of bread/biscuitiness.
The taste is basically sweet through the previously mentioned flavors.
On the palate, its mostly on a medium sort of body with a nice sessionable sort of quality to it. There is a decent light harshness on the tongue, no aftertaste or finish.

To English-sized pint glass, it pours a coppery amber brownish tone with which a snowy white head 1 finger in length stood. Smells and tastes of tin, caramelized onions, denim, and Bible paper.

Bread crusts, earth-covered wood and spicy hop bitterness make this quencher feel wholesome from aroma to finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the hazy amber.
-A light fruitiness is found, reminiscent of apricot jam or marmelade.
-The flavor profile is balanced.
-The smooth effervescence and healthy body contribute to a comfortable body.
