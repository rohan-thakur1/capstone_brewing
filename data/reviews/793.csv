793,"2016-10-29",3.0,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2016 Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a black color with a medium sized foamy dark brown head that faded quickly and left minimal lacing. The aroma was roasty and toasty with a hint of smoke and wood. The flavor was roasty with anise, molasses, bread crust, a bit of dark fruit and a hint of smoke. Long finish. Medium body. Decent.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
793,"2009-08-23",3.6,"Murky amber brown in color with a very thin, soapy head and little to no lacing.  Applesauce, mild red wine, banana and spice aromas.  Very strong aroma.  Medium bodied and finishes clean.  Lightly sweetened and very malty.  Tastes almost like a fruity wine mixed with a wheat beer.  Plenty of clove and banana in the background.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
793,"2009-02-21",3.0,"Extremely cloudy milk chocolate color with a head that was non-existant after a few sips. Aroma was a pretty nice balance between stale malts and wheat. I thought the wheat disappeared in the flavor, leaving mostly malts and caramel. Medium body, little carbonation (like flat cola), with an unpleasant metallic aftertaste. Im not impressed.","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","jmm635"
793,"2009-01-31",3.0,"750 ml bottle shared by mreusch. Pours a hazy dark caramel with a beige head that collapses quickly to a still surface. The nose is of sweet caramel, clove and a mild, stale root beer note. Light-bodied but with a mouth-filling fine carbonation, the flavor follows the nose with a dry finish (a bit odd for the style). It was great to get the chance to try it, but as a fan of dunkelweizens, I was fairly underwhelmed by this one.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
793,"2009-01-28",3.5,"The most interesting part about this beer is the label and glass. It was shared by mreusch through way of hopdog, thanks go out to both.  So what we are looking at is a large format bottle with an old, I mean old ass Stoudts label saying Reserve or something.  Then there is a small printed piece of paper glued on top of that sayings its a dunkel.  I am trying to figure out how old this is and I see the label says its a 765mL bottle, something that Stoudts has not put out for many years, exciting, right?  But then I see the glass actually says its a 750mL bottle.  Well now things are becoming clear, Stoudts used old ass lables with their new bottles, must have found a stash somewhere.  And on top of that, its actually a capable 750mL but they use cork and wire anyway.  Seems to explain the high sticker price I guess. Oh and the beer, well it pours with a big bubbly, soapy head.  Body is hazy, dark copper, almost brown. Head drops so quickly though, almost as if there was nothing there.  Aroma is fruity, lightly bready black  wheat.  Nice aroma but the taste lets down a bit. Just like watery dark wheat bread, not much else. Lightly sweet and the body becomes just a bit sticky at the end.  First raters of the bottle, thats pretty cool.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
793,"2009-01-28",3.6,"750ml bottle, with a big thanks to hopdog for the surprise!  Pours a slightly hazy light brown with a fizzy tan head, minimal retention and lacing.  Aroma is fresh and peel of apple and pear, very fruity with a little yeast.  Flavor is more of the same, with some wood.  Interesting and pretty drinkable.  Thanks again Steve!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"

It was served very cold and i tried to wait a few minutes for it to warm up !!! This was a average brew, but i must say Stoudt’s does make other delicious beer.  :)","Mt.Joy, Pennsylvania, USA","BeerGestapo"
