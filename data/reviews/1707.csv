1707,"2016-10-23",3.6,"The American craft beer revolution originally drew on old English traditions more than anything else but a German influence also crept in at an early stage, and this is one of the classic American interpretations of the Bavarian Weissbier style. Medium thick, egg-white, creamy head leaving a dense rim around the glass and a thin veil in the middle, but certainly a lot less frothy than I am used to in this particular beer type; immediately and equally cloudy straw blonde robe with slight ochre-ish hue. Aroma of ripe banana, apple peel, some biscuit, white bread crumbs, dried orange peel, old cloves, white pepper, vanilla sugar somewhere, straw, pear juice, sweet (unpickled) gherkin, sweetbread, melting butter, raw turnip, field flowers, artisanal honey, candied pineapple. Crisp, fruity onset, lots of the expected banana ester (isoamylacetate), sweet, paired with balancing green plum-, starfruit- and unripe kiwi-like sourishness, refreshing with spritzy, minerally carbonation slightly coarsening an otherwise smooth, fluffy mouthfeel. Pleasantly soft bready and biscuity barley sweetness in the middle with utterly soapy and very gently souring wheat, carrying the banana and other fruit flavors onwards to the finish, meeting with an earthy yeastiness and soft hayish hop bitterish touch as well as aromatic phenols - quite strongly so, but still feeling natural and actually quite enjoyable. Banana flavor lingers a bit along with the biscuity malts and softly sourish, very soapy wheatiness. Authentic Bavarian Hefeweizen can be a real treat if fresh enough and served properly and many attempts at this ancient style that have been made out of its historical region seem to lack finesse and balance, often ending up as a one-sidedly banana-drenched caricature of the style. This one, however, understands the refinement, balance and subtlety of it: it is very heavy in the cliché banana flavor of the style, but also adds the spicy phenols that are indispensable for the overall balance; its mouthfeel and overall personality well match the German standard. The only thing lacking a bit for me, is a lush, whipped cream-like head formation, normally established by the wheat, and indeed it seems the wheat factor is a little bit understated here. Apart from that, I can imagine this being an introduction to Weissbier for many young American consumers, and having tasted dozens of German examples, I can only confirm that this is a credible, genuine and very useful beer to get acquainted with the style- though I also think it is a bit overrated here as a result of the American prevalence in its ratings. Sierra Nevada, one of the US pioneers in craft brewing, has done many influential things for the craft beer movement in the New World and its good to revisit them every now and then.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

I poured mine into a 32oz Aquafina water bottle.Poured a nice yellow color, I would almost call it lemon. Nice and cloudy, little black specks in there. I cant honestly give you much detail on the head, after all, I poured it into a water bottle.Aroma was citrusy, a little banana, and spicy clove.Taste was much of the same, didnt really pick up much of the banana though. The clove and spices was the highlight. It had a chewy feel to it.Mouthfeel was light, although chewy. Goes down easy. Totally perfect for fishing!Overall, it was very good.

1707,"2015-07-03",3.1,"Bottled 4/7/15, drunk 7/3/15Heavily hazy, deep amber golden liquid is heavily carbonated and produces a massive white head that is well-retained.As with the kolsch and pilsner in this Summer 12 pack, I get more hops up front, with the actual style character in the background. This one has probably the most non-hop character of the three, with light clove and bubble gum and a very heavy mineral water-like character. Rather rustic, with baked bread, hay, some light plaster. Nice, if not exactly classic hefe territory. Anyways, no resin or alcohol, no flaws but it would be nice if there was more spiciness to it.The flavor is soft, with sticky honeyed malts that are fairly well-attenuated wrapping around very light white pepper and clove suggestions. Breadiness builds up but the watery texture and ample carbonation help clear the palate. Tons of bubblegum on the finish and a lingering spicy dryness that is pleasing, if somewhat too brief. Im drinking this right from the fridge without letting it warm and its borderline too sweet/malty, so Id hate to see it if it sat for like 10 minutes, though at the same time, it dosent really give the esters and phenols as much an opportunity to shine. Still, its clean and passable if actually a bit too clean. Were entering American wheat territory here....Also, the beer is oddly very, very watery, much moreso than even a 5% hefe should be.To be fair, Im rating this lower to-style here (a clean, but very, very light, watery, borderline bland, German hefe).

The flavor profile is world class. Bold in intensity, very complex and balanced to perfection. It begins with a blend of flavors that separate into the finish.

White dough and prickly light spice in the flavor with mild fruitiness bringing to mind Bartlett pears and pineapple, though the gentle banana notes are always the clearest. The wet dough sensation generally overwhelms the brisk spiciness.

This is amplified throughout the mushy, yeasty body. Zippy carbonation flashes briefly to be thoroughly softened before the finish. Lingering banana sweetness with the tiniest hint of goat milk.

1707,"2014-08-03",4.0,"12 oz bottle poured into a hefe glass. Big banana and clove notes greet the nose along with a touch of dampness / bread dough, and wheat. I also pick up, distinctly, ""Nila wafers"" - basically a combination of the banana, with some biscuit, and vanilla. Theres also a light floral touch and some pine in the aroma. A big, hefe spongy creamy white head tops the opaque hazy gold yellow body. The head retains quite well and leaves a messy, poofy lace. I would say this is a pretty shining example of what a hefe should look like. The taste is a medium sweet and medium light bitter with just a touch of sour. The body is somewhere between medium and light, maybe more on the light side and has a thin, watery texture. Theres a surprisingly low amount of soft carbonation - or maybe its just so soft that I cant feel it - nonetheless, its very smooth. Theres a big banana and clove finish which starts to turn more towards clove and vanilla in the aftertaste with a touch of pine and tropical fruit.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

1707,"2014-06-16",3.5,"Transfer from BA review on 5-19-12- 
Poured from bottle into weizen glass

Appearance  Pours a very hazy light yellow-orange/golden color. There is a billowing white head that is formed upon pouring. The head has a good persistence and fades to leave a good level of lacing on the sides of the glass.

Smell  The aroma is heavy of banana, yeast, and pepper; very classic Hefeweizen. Mixed with three three stronger previously mentioned aromas is a lighter citrus aroma in the background.

Taste  A lemon citrus and bready flavor meets the tongue. These are soon meet with flavors of yeast, which bring with it a flavor of banana and pepper. The banana is light, but the pepper gets stronger and stronger as the taste advances. Other spices and some sweeter citrus flavors then work their way in toward the end, with the pepper and yeast taking big command of the taste. In the end it has a very yeasty, peppery and citrusy flavor.

Mouthfeel  A medium thickness in body and an average level of carbonation. Nothing too special here.

Overall  Not bad, but nothing too spectacular either. Easy to drink but nothing special.","","Darkmagus82"

Cloudy hazy golden honey colour with dirt like yeast sediments; Two finger head with crumpety white foam which last for about 2 minutes and then fell flat dramatically (unlike Germans hefeweiss, which usually stay pretty frothy throughout); Small sticky lacing and active carbonation; Very fragrant aroma of banana, vanilla, caramel, malt, clove, and spices; Pleasant taste of light malt, light caramel, earthy yeast, cloves, tartness, faint hint of citrus and grass; Light body, crisp palate; Taste is nearly non-sweet light malt in a very light tart background, with pleasant slight phenol, cloves, and spices; Hoppiness is minimal, with faint citrus taste and almost no bitterness. Finishing is clove and tartness; Slightly dry after taste, very easy to mouth.

Comments: This is a very good but not great hefeweiss. I have to applaud SNs effort in making a hefeweiss on par with the likes of Paulaner, Meisel and Keiler.

The flavor notes were caramel and citrus.  I will be grabbing a few six packs of this brew throughout the spring and summer.

2 reviews herewith firstly, and the one I leave my ratings with is the standard beer from tap. The 2nd review was the same beer, parallel tasting but via a Randall. Randall contained less hops than you would expect via Randall but contained 3 or 4 large ripe orange peels to infuse this flavour on the original product!
Non Randall : - Pale hazy light amber/yellow with a thin white head.
Nose comprises wheat, pale malt, grain, light citrus.
Tastes of light yeast tones, touch of nana, clove, touch of diacetyl.
Medium bodied with soft carbonation.
Ok slightly above average Hefe in my book - Im sure there arent too many Bavarian brewers shitting it at this one mind !!!
----- Randalized version infused with hops and orange rind/peel.
Hazed dark amber/orange in appearance with a thin off white head that soon reduces to a pond.
Nose is bitter orange, dung, figs, dried fruits.
Tastes of Seville orange, Cointreau licquer, caramel notes, light spice.
Medium bodied with soft carbonation leading to a fruity finish.

Flavor continues with banana and clove but there is also a decent taste of ginger from the yeast presumably. More tropical fruit and a little bit of light bready malt. There is a slight tartness towards the finish but it doesnt really detract from the flavor. Hops are practically not existent but there is a pleasant clean, dry finish.

1707,"2012-04-09",4.2,"A: Pours a beautifully cloudy golden yellow color thats surprisingly well blended in spite of its yeasty fog. The head isnt particularly impressive, its a one head white color with mediocre retention/lacing.

S: Theres a heavy noble aspect to this, which leads me to suspect it was well hopped with Saaz, Hallertau, and the like. Beneath the earthiness lies some banana and clove character.

T: I notice the clove notes first and foremost, but also a hit of noble hops on the finish. I also find a bit of citric character buried beneath the weizen notes, an excellent addition, in my opinion. The yeast is noticeable but it never gets in the way on the back end, always a good thing. Flavorful and easy to kill.

M: Very, very well carbonated without being overly so. Medium bodied with an amazingly crisp, subtly dry finish. The drinkability factor is incredible.

O: My favorite American-made hefe, and my favorite Sierra Nevada beer. Not quite on the same level as Weihenstephaners (brilliant, brilliant) hefe, but easily on par with the Ayingers and Franziskaners of the world, perhaps even a touch better. Plus, its cheap and very, VERY easy to find, which is criminal for a beer of this quality.

It smells like a banana smoothie, and a slight hint of clove. 

The first impression of this beer is banana. Its very sweet and creamy, until the bubblegum cleans it up half way through. You also get a bit of spicy citrus near the finish. On the way down, the dryness of the yeast, and a lingering taste of those dried banana chips from trail mix hits you. Its all very well balanced, and the carbonation level helps propel those flavors.

1707,"2012-02-28",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/29/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Kellerweis pours a transparent pale yellow color, leaning toward golden. A frothy white head forms, yielding rocky bubbles, but it fades quickly, leaving just a few islands of foam on top. Carbonation is visible from the bottom of the glass rising up.

A nice bouquet of aromas. With a pale malt backbone, banana and clove really pop, demonstrating the style quite well. 

The light malt is noticeable in the taste, but it does not dominate in any way. Smooth banana and clove flavor really take over, while some light floral hops contribute to the supporting cast in the background. Finishes with a light sweetness and more banana.

It feels bubbly, somewhat dry, and crisp on the tongue. Light body, medium to full carbonation.

This is one that I would be happy with on a nice summer day, sipping away until I forget how many I have had.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1707,"2011-07-11",3.6,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a German wheat beer glass.Appearance: Yellow/dark golden-brown hue. Very hazy but some translucency. Plenty of carbonation visible, no yeast chunks, though. Forms a large, bright white, foamy head which retains very well and laces the glass.Smell: Sweeter than a German hefeweizen with light banana and clove-like scents, combined with flowers and candy. Taste: Theres a definite distinction between German and American wheat beers and right off the bat, Kellerweis plays into safer American territory. The palate is remarkably light and clean - the first two descriptions that come to mind upon the initial swig. Light banana candy, clove-flavoring and a melange of spice rack spices are all prominent throughout the palate. Despite this complexity, the actual robustness of the palate is mild throughout. It doesnt taste like any kind of supermarket brand ""summer wheat ale"", yet it doesnt have the pure energy I look for in a hefeweizen. Not that theres anything off-putting to the taste here, though. The candy-like sweetness is overt from beginning to end with a hint of bitterness in the middle and a quick burst of authentic clove and other spices right on the finish. Mouthfeel: A little thicker than most American beers of the style. Slight carbonation tingling sensation. The aftertaste is clean as a whistle.Drinkability: While I wouldnt jump for joy for this beer overall, I can honestly say its sheer drinkability value alone is amazing. The mild palate, soft mouthfeel and clean aftertaste make it an absolutely perfect beer for the warmer months. Definitely the kind of beer Joe Six Packs and beer nerds alike can chug and enjoy and at 4.8% ABV can be so for long durations.Overall, Kellerweis is probably one of the better American hefeweizens Ive had, but its still just a good beer at the end of the day.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Big wads of yeast drop to the base and dissolve into the mad flurry of fine carbonation that pushes up to the surface with lightning speed. The head is huge, a beautifully formed billowing white cloud that lifts a good inch atop the rim of the glass. It holds for the length and laces well. The body of beer a sandy yellow and opaque, definitely spot on for appearance. A little sulphury at first is the nose, sweaty socks, then  a good waft of unripened banana and fresh zested lemon, a little clove-like phenolics, gritty wheat and damp toothpicks. Tangy, sweet juicy bananas, limes and lemons hit the mouth first, a little vanilla ice-cream softens it with a good base of wheat malt across the mid-palate, clean and smooth. Good body, firm mouthfeel without becoming clammy, the carbonation spritzy just on the tip of the tongue. Mild phenols play late, it fades off quickly in the swallow.  Keeps good, very refreshing overall, just lacking the delicacy of Bayern weissbiers. Still, a solid example of the style, nice. I could easily throw these back all day!

The flavor is clean and pure German hefeweizen fashion with a base of wheat and spicy yeast that not only holds it ground with clove and banana but also a bit of mint or green rosemary not yet dried. Fantastic beer that Im already spreading the word about to people who like hef styled beers.

And to simulate the aroma, simply insert a banana into one nostril and a clove in the other, then snort.  Tastes like the biggest hefeweizen in history, yeasty tartness intertwined with the aforementioned nose-pluggings.

It pours a nice golden color with a hint of peach. The head is big, white, and foamy, though it doesnt hold as well as most Hefe heads and doesnt leave too much lacing. I love the color, but the head could be nicer.

The smell is pretty traditional. I would say the citrus is amped up more than in other traditional German hefeweizens but it also could be a freshness factor. The clove lingers in the background.

The flavor is predominantly clove and wheat malt. There is a nice tartness from the lemon and there is a lingering taste of ripe banana. It is an all-encompassing Hefeweizen, much like Weihenstephaner, though the mouthfeel here could be worked on.

Appearance: The body is very cloudy with a pale yellow/tan color. Its head is like any good Hefeweizen, it is tall, thick and fairly long lasting. This makes for good lacing on the glass. 

Smell: In the nose I pick up lots of bready and phonic yeast character with notes of banana and spicy clove. 

Taste/Palate: On the tongue there are loads of bready yeast notes with hints of mashed up banana, clove and tangy wheat or sour dough bread. I am also getting very slight notes of pineapple or some other tropical fruit. The body has a solid medium feel with a firm smooth texture and mild carbonation.

Slight bit of sourness, but not much however.  Seems to be balanced very well.  No one flavor is dominant over the other.  Still not picking up the aforementioned banana.  Very light, crisp, smooth and watery mouthfeel.  I could definitely set a few of these back on a hot day.  Very nice looking beer, but the smell brings the score down just a bit.

Appearance : Hazy yellow medium head. Light veil stays until the end.

Aroma : Lots of wheat. A bit citrusy. A little bit dusty. Very clean and fresh. Herbal notes. Very light funkyness also.

Taste : Wheat, a bit grassy. A little bit tart/tangy. Finish is wheat, light peppery notes maybe. A tiny bit salty also. Quite deep.

Overall : Wow. Highly drinkable and refreshing. Soft carbonation. I have to slow myself down so I have the time to rate it. Nose is ok but it has nothing very special.

Overall: Not exactly what Im looking for in a Hefeweizen. Its too bitter and the pine resin flavor doesnt go with this style.

The nose brings prevalent but not overly aggressive notes of banana, along with some almost citrusy notes.  The palate shows similar yeast esters, again, almost resembling a Belgian White as much as a German hefeweizen.

Very light on the palate with a banana/clove flavor exactly matching the aroma rolling in from front to back.  A nice grain husk flavor complements this with a light hop background.

1707,"2010-02-07",4.5,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint. 

Appearance: Straw colored, hazy with a 1"" head that quickly goes down to a film. Not a resilient head.

Smell: Fruity familiar hefe smell with a yeast background, a hint of banana and yogurt. I can smell what resembles the smell of rubber balloons also, but not in a bad way.

Taste: Banana, tangy lemon zest with some vanilla yogurt and spice sneaking in too. Very slightly bitter at the end - just enough to give it a nice smack. 

Mouthfeel: Creamy texture that is quite smooth going down. Plenty enough carbonation. Medium body to it.

Drinkability: A true guzzler. This is the perfect drink for any hot day when you want something refreshing and not filling. Scores a perfect 10 on the refresh-o-meter. Not sweet and syrupy - just right.

Comments: Every quaff made me want to come back for more. I think it measures up against any German hefeweizen. The best part about it is that its far more readily available, fresher, and cheaper than imported hefes. This is my idea of an everyday beer. Perfect also for someone wanting to try their first craft beer or hefeweizen. A good beer for those who dont like beer.","Louisiana, USA","jovy1097"

Taste was very impressive, smooth, a little heavy in feel, notes of not-quite-ripe bananna, lemon, mild hops, and very good malts. I dont know if I would call the flavors complex, but they all compliment each other very nicely. I do believe the open fermentation process attributes are noticeable in this brew. A very impressive, well balanced hefeweizen from a reliable brewery.","Houston, Texas, USA","stephenj007"

Aroma is of banana, orange and yeast. 

Medium carbonation and body, deliciously thick yet earthy mouth feel. 

Weizen flavour is very similar to the German SCHÖFFERHOFER hef, meaning its considerably less sweetish than the Bavarian variety - perhaps, the Sierra Nevada is leaner still: Spicy, not very sweet, with a limited range of fruit (banana and citrus, the latter dominating), with a decidedly sour, moderately bitter finish and citrusy after taste.

1707,"2009-11-12",3.1,"Thanks to bhensonb. Pours a hazy, dark yellow with a coarse, quickly dissipating head. Pulled this one as the last of my Dancing Man is all gone and I probably wont be able to get any more until next summer. Im afraid that SN isnt going to be a good substitution. The nose is banana/yeast, and the initial taste is the same. Spice notes follow quickly but are not strong. The beer has the unusual character of being both slightly sweet then slightly astringent/dry immediately on the heels of the sweet - bot both dont appear at the same time. The character in beers when these two are able to exist together create a nice complexity. The two dont exist together here and the result is not all that great.

Banana comes through bigger in the flavor with the spices pulling up a supporting role.  Rich, chewy wheat malt and a little citrus tang.  Medium bodied with average, refreshing carbonation.  Smooth with a clean finish.  Overall a really tasty Hefeweizen and one I could consume on a nearly daily basis.

1707,"2009-08-27",3.6,"In short: A extra-full-bodied nourishing Hefeweizen.  Like a condensed traditional hefeweizen.  Very good even if a bit heavy for the style.
How: Bottle 12oz (many).  Consumed fresh soon after the beer release.
The look: Opaque dark yellow body topped by a medium white head
In long: Typical but unusually intense Hefeweizen nose with a truckload of bananas and fresh cereals.  Body is as full as it gets for the style, this is like chewing hay.  Simple but strong taste of young (greenish) bananas and compressed hay/straws.  Very yeasty.  No such things as spicy notes (coriander or others) and orange peels.  Good amount of grassy hops.  I drank my six-pack over the course of many days because I found it a little too sweet for the style.  Very nourishing but not really refreshing.  It loses a few points because of that but it remains a superior example of the style, this really is a Killerweis.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Aroma of mildly sour wheat, muted bubblegum, and sweet banana esters.  There is a nice clove element behind that.  The nose is nice, though not terribly complex.  Taste is sweet banana esters, big clove and bubble gum.  The mild;y sour wheat from the nose is not present in the taste, and probably would have helped balance this out a bit.  Also some apple fruit present.  Palate is chewy medium, also notable unfiltered.  Carbonation is low to medium, right for the style.

Hearty body with a malt and wheat front palate, a yeasty sort of middle and a finish of that spice again with just a touch of lemon. Nice hefe with good body and expanded palate that I didnt expect.

1707,"2009-08-19",3.3,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2015 Have been waiting for this for a month and had to come all the way out to New Jersey for a bottle.  Big estery nose on cap open, heavy banana and wheat, lighter cloves.  Lemon-citrus and yeast.  Pale yellow with a large, creamy white head that clings and laces well.  Body is thin and mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, seemingly no carbonation despite the large head.  Watery banana and lemon, but theyre right, there is some complexity here, with a touch of spice and bitter pretzel.  Pale malt and strengthening clove.  The complexity is not quite as advertised, but this is sweet and ridiculously repeatable - easy to down a pitcher or two every night. [2009.08.19: 3.3]Ive had about three cases of this over the years and still enjoy it.  I want to like it more than I do; I recognize the German yeast strain (and props for using it!), I recognize the house character, and I like the slightly tart and grainy character.  But the yeast puts out a bit too much sulfur for me as used, and the bubblegum-leaning phenols dont mesh with the frequent slime.  [2015.05.03: 3.3]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1707,"2009-08-19",3.7,"A cloudy pour that reminds us of this beer being unfiltered. There is a bit of head on this one, about one finger. On the aroma, there is a fair amount of bananbread and cloves. Definitely a hefeweizen. On the initial flavor all of these aromas come through, but the body is also a bit fuller which whirls these flavors around for a bit of complexity. Though the fruit-like flavors from a typical hefeweizen are present they are a bit more muted and dont jump out quite as much as in a typical wheat beer. Overall, I would say this is a great beer for the summer but in general a good wheat beer if you dont want something that is too light (definitely no lemon to be served with this one).","Richmond, Virginia, USA","ruskiimperial"

1707,"2009-08-15",2.9,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2009 Obscured lemon. Creamy stark-white froth displays good retention. Phenolic nose of plastic and clove, with subtler scents of dough, sulfur, dried pineapple and banana taffy. Soft, fine-bubbled carbonation. Thin and watery body. Initially spicy and arid with clove and sharp plastic notes, yet notably toasty as well. Not a whole lot of vibrancy to speak of, as the rampant toastiness creates a disagreeable tandem as it joins the overripe banana/banana taffy qualities. Though the body is fairly dry, dabs of baked apples exacerbate the dullness while contributing substantial flabbiness and weight. Decently layered in the malt department, as dry crackery malt overlaps the slicker and beefier wheat tang, but there is very little depth to speak of. Finishes clove-spicy and lightly floral, with dull banana notes lingering alongside hints of borderline astringent toasted grain and doughy yeast. Explosiveness as well as subtlety, cleanness and vibrancy (e.g. in this case the hop definition is poor, and the banana character is artificial/taffylike/overripe) are key elements that can make or break this style of beer. Sadly, it lacks all of those features. The wheat is also mushy and the beer is tainted by sulfur notes. Love the open-fermentation approach they took, but I cant say I am impressed. Was so hoping to love this as one thing the world is lacking is reliably fresh, well-crafted weissbier. Bummer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The flavor is a delicious blend of wheat, banana, lemon/citrus, clove, bubblegum, hay, grass and herbal noble hops. Pleasantly sweet on the palate while the hop bitterness just plays a balancing role - which mustve felt weird for Sierra Nevada. Medium body which coats the mouth very nicely; moderate carbonation. While its nothing mind-blowing, it just really hits the spot as the perfect drinkin beer.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
1707,"2009-08-09",3.9,"Sierra Nevada has graced us with not one but two new beers this year, although getting my hands on, much less keeping their Torpedo IIPA in stock is proving to be a feat of magic and miracles. On the other hand, their Kellerweisse Hefeweizen is much easier to find and just as delicious to sup. While I laud the Torpedo for its exuberant yummyness, I also chastise it for its lack of availability. Thats alright though; it is a temporary issue which will eventually be resolved. Hopefully. In the meantime, I am going to sup on many a 6pack of Kellerweisse Hefeweizen. Sierra Nevada finally got a wheat beer right. Even better, its a bottle-conditioned Hefeweizen which guarantees a longer shelf life and some maturation with age.


Clouds of orangesicle, yellow cream, and white marshmallow puffs fill my glass with rich beauty; truly a work of art. Her white head floats suspended, lazing about with nonchalant lessez-faire while I make sure to swirl the bottle dregs into my glass. The dregs WILL be mine! As I pour the last of her luscious chunky bits into my glass, a billowing bouquet of bananas, banana cream, banana bread warm from the oven with nuts aromatizing the air while spices and clove tease my senses. Amazingly smooth, creamy, and bursting with all the hefeweizen esters I love so much. A touch of toasted meringue and I am on to quaffing bliss. Just as her nose promised, the mouthfeel is also smooth, creamy, and boldly going where many beers before her have gone. Gliding over my tastebuds, banana cream lays next to banana pudding while I slice into a huge chunk of warm banana nut bread exuding cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Real butter is really good so of course I slather a generous amount over my banana bread which melts into the Kellerweisse Hefeweizens gorgeous palate. My breath is warm with clove and spice while toasted nuts lightly dry my palate just in time for another generous quaff. She is gentle as silk, belying her lightly chewy mouthfeel. As she grows just a touch drier, the palate evolves from banana bread warm from the oven to dry banana bread mix. Exquisite balance. Each quaff is traced by beautifully creamy lace and far sooner than expected, my glass is empty. Good thing I have more in my fridge because I feel a second coming.


German Hefeweizens are a love-hate relationship for many. I, of course, fall amongst the love em camp. Great year round, they especially shine in the warmer muggy months where the sun shows no mercy and the skies are an endless deep blue sea. Excellent job, Sierra Nevada. A true German-style Hefeweizen, she is a proud new addition to a long established family of good beers.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

They really nailed the creamy mouthfeel that you typically only get in a German Hefe. Seems to be some noble hops in there. Dry finish.

I like this moderately sweet aroma. The flavor is solid, but I like the aroma a little more. Soft cloves are aplenty as well as a milky banana-wheat bread, yeast, a subdued citrus zest, pear, and more of that bubble gum taste. Finishes semi-dry with a creamy banana, yeast, wheat, semi-zesty citrus that lingers for a moderate amount of time. Medium to full bodied, creamy smooth, and a nice soft carbonation.

1707,"2009-07-22",2.8,"Bottle.

Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, husks), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with light notes of lemon peel, melon rind, banana/gum, clove.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

The aroma isnt unpleasant, but the German wheat character is muted and unexciting...it comes off a little like an American wheat (light, mild-to-bland, citrus zest) mixed with a German wheat. The mouth experience is its weaker point, being thinner and more watery than your average Hefeweizen.  Looks nice, but otherwise is quite ho-hum.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1707,"2009-07-21",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Banana bread allusions seep into clove and citrus nuances as the cushiony body of this intricate Hefeweizen also brings forth minutious pears and herbal hop bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A tower of foam sits atop the cloudy straw golden.
-The clovey phenols become more prominent in the finish.
-This is exactly the kind of beer which everyone (with an open mind) can enjoy; its complex, but its so drinkable that it doesnt compel you analyze it.
-Residual sugars are well calculated, setting a fluffy base on which the yeast can express its milky banana bread personality.

1707,"2009-07-13",3.4,"Huge off white head with the initial pour, the body is a very hazy gold orange. It looks like a classic hefe. The nose is light banana and mango. There is also a little bit of fresh bread dough. The taste has some old chewed bubblegum and a little bit of banana peels. There is also some nice clove spice in the finish. The flavors are a little rounded out when you dump in the yeast.  The carbonation is light and creates a creamy smooth mouth feel. Nice for the style, this still isnt quite for me.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Mouthfeel is velvety and the finish is on the sweet side. Id like to see more of that traditional tangy bite. No wonder this appeals to american palates.

1707,"2009-07-10",4.1,"I am rather picky about my Hefes, but let me tell you, this is a well-done hefeweizen. If you disagree, you are a fucktard. Pours a hazy orange amber with a white head. The aroma is not quite as assertive as good German imports, but it has a nice nose of yeast and banana esters. The unfiltered body is light to medium, refreshing without being watery. Flavor of pale wheat malts, with the phenols of banana, bubblegum, and clove all melded to create a nice balance. Moderate attenuation. Clove becomes more pronounced on the finish with perhaps a small hint of European hops. I like this beer better without the yeast in the pour, which is not normal for me. I think it ruins the finish on this one. Great beer, but not the perfect Hefe for me.My ideal Hefe would have just a bit more body, bubblegum, and sweetness.

Flavor is almost tart up top, then into light grain, wheat, and the first part of that banana flavor that Hef is known for.

The aroma is wonderful and everything youd want and expect from a hefe.  Theres the bubble gum and banana sweetness mixing with some lemony hops and, as it warms, a clean peppery spice  aroma.

The taste has an initial lemon zest pop before the sweet malted wheat takes over, with the bananas coming in strong.  The finish is slightly bready and with a bit of peppery spices that tingle the palate.

The mouthfeel is very active with lots of carbonation.  It seems to have a light mouthfeel but still completely fills the mouth, which is definitely saying something.

This is a fantastic hefe from Sierra Nevada and a great craft beer introduction for most people out there.  I drank this one with some non-BA friends and they absolutely loved it.

Sour corn mash aroma with a significant dose of wheat and yeast. No citrus smell that is typical of this style.

Perhaps this is the smoothest hefeweizen Ive ever had. No yeast bite; the wheat is present without shouting. Strong flavor of banana (although its nowhere in the nose). Thicker and less spritzy than many wheat beers (adds to the sweetness). Overall, a very quaffable beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"
1707,"2009-07-03",3.6,"Bottle Code 91131 17 12; Sampled June 2009
The beer pours into my New Belgium Goblet with a hazy, straw-hued, pale amber color.  It is topped by a two finger, pale tan colored head.  The aroma is not exactly the classical balance that a typical Hefeweizen has; instead this is a balance between spicy notes, some pepper, a herbal hop note, definite clove, perhaps some light banan as well as som grain like notes with a big wheat contribution and some hay-like notes.  I like the added herbal and spice note that are not typically found in a Hefeweizen, at least to this level; these notes are well in balance with the other, more typical notes.

The beer is fairly light bodied and it has a spritzy carbonation as it rolls across my tongue.  The finish has a spicy hit of clove to it that is definitely traditional.  The beer is quite dry, but does have something of a chewy body to it.  There is a light tartness here that couples with a bit of pepper in the finish and the wheat character is nice and chewy with a touch of grassiness.  This is quite easy to drink; in fact I find my 12oz pour disappearing a bit too quickly.  Clove flavors are present here, but the banana character is quite soft.  There is a hop character here that contributes to the perceived spiciness of this brew as well as contributing a mildly biting bitterness in the finish.  I do like the body of this brew, especially as this warms up a bit, it is fresh and chewy, though it is not quite as good as the decocted, lush, fresh, Live Oak Hefeweizen.

This is on the spicy / herbal side compared to your typically traditional HefeWeizen, but it actually works quite well here and in fact boosts the complexity.  The traditional Hefeweizen notes are here, but they are perhaps not as pronounced as when found in a traditional example; luckily the additional character is here, as this would be a bit too muted without the spicy / herbal components.  I definitely feel like I need to pick up a couple more of these before I ultimately decide if this one is a go to beer or not.

1707,"2009-07-02",4.0,"Sampled on 7/2/2009. This Hefeweizen pours a moderately cloudy orange gold color from a 12oz bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head with good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is light malt, banana, clove and some lemon. A medium to full bodied Hefeweizen. The malts are fruity and sweet, lots of banana and clove, with a nice touch of pineapple. Lively carbonation. There is a very appealing softness to this beer as well. Nice touch of yeast as well. Nice balance. Excellent summer beer. Glad this one will be a regular beer.  Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

Pour was a nice cloudy light orange with lots of swirling bubbles and a one finger white head. Taste was extremely crisp and refreshing. Here is where the trademark banana flavor comes in. There is a yeasty bite that is complemented by the strongest (and for me best) carbonation Ive had in some time. This beer is great on so many levels.

Occasional touches of the SN hops. Awesome. First american wheat Ive had that was even good, much less outstanding. Ill buy a lot more of this.

1707,"2009-06-30",3.9,"Ive consumed about 1/3 of a case this week. Very yeasty, murky body with a thick, velvety white head. Some sulfur in the nose in some bottles, but I get that in virtually any beer as fresh and yeasty as this. Great mouthfeel for an American brewed hefeweizen. Good mix of clove-like esters, moderate citrus, and light phenols. Not overly fruity. A little dirtier than an elite German Hefeweizen, but tons of character and refreshment at the same time. Eclipses all NEW Sierra Nevada releases since Celebration, in my opinion. When it comes to wheat beers, this is the polar opposite of the bland and pedestrian Sierra Nevada Wheat and a welcome addition to the macro craft-beer world.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

Flavor is tangy, with more clove than I prefer.  Has a decent amount of citrus.  People will probably laugh, but it seriously reminded me of Hoegarden (which I dont care for, becuase I dont like watery lemonade)  Light body with more than necessary fizziness, almost hurts the tongue.  Its like mixing banana and clove flavored soda with pop rocks.  Actually, it reminds me of my recent homebrew batch that I screwed up with too much priming sugar.   I really tried to like this one, but its not for me.  Ill probably try it again someday though.  Hopefully it was a bad bottle.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"
1707,"2009-06-30",3.7,"5/06/2009:  Sierra Nevada Kellerweis Hefeweizen is super cloudy to the point of appearing to be opaque.  It has a tarnished bronze color that reminds me of dark applesauce.  There is a foamy, thick, off-white head on the that leaves plenty of lacing marks on the glass.  The aroma contains toasted wheat (actually, LOTS of wheat malt), and is roasty with a slight smoke characteristic.  The deep clove and banana flavor also has a hint of lemon and then more lemony citrus in the finish.  This beer has a medium body, is a little chewy.  Overall this beer is satisfying and refreshing.  It reminds me of a Dunkel Weissbier.

6/25/2009:  From the bottle, Sierra Nevada Kellerweis is cloudy and a dirty, golden blonde color.  The aroma is smoky with caramelized wheat.

Mmm, those need revisiting because this assumes the place of those newbie hefes. Very real banana presence here in the aroma, just lovely, conditioned so finely you may expect weird dusty rem-NANTs in the head.

1707,"2009-06-23",4.0,"Amazing.  One of two American Hefeweizens (the other is New Glarus Dancing Man) that I find remotely interesting.   This is as good, if not better than than many German Hefes.    Banana, clove, bubblegum and citrus on the nose.  The pour is cloudy and awesome looking.  The taste is divine.  Reminds me of Paulaner, and that is about the highest compliment I could give a beer.  Awesome.

Big yeasty flavor, sourdough, perfectly thick body and carbonation. Easily drinkable, my only complaint is a bit of a rubbing alcohol note, and perhaps a lack of spiciness against its German counterparts. A very well crafted beer.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

1707,"2009-06-23",4.2,"12 oz bottle.  Pours an initial slight hazy light gold yellowish but the swirling and final pours are rediculously cloudy with chunks of yeast snot floating around- high carbonation and massive sticky white head and some nice lace.  Aroma is light on the banana esters, but is skewed just slightly more towards the clove phenolics with hints of vanilla- really a nice balance of esters and phenols- tons of doughy wheat malts as well with a wierd light all grain bread toastiness, and whole wheat fresh bagels with touch of lemon citrus.  Flavor is so doughy fresh wheat, huge malt, and creaminess- probable decoction mashed to pull the full maltiness out- light lemon zest, phenolic yeastiness, light clove and hints of vanilla with a very slight spicy hop character- dry and just beautifully soft in the mouth despite a very high carbonation.  This is serious good stuff- and right up there with Schneider and Weihenstephan, although all are so unique.  Ill have to try them all side by side soon.

The flavor has wheat and all the yeast character you would expect.   Medium-light bodied with smooth texture.   Nothing new in the genre, which is pretty narrow in the traditional sense, but just well balanced and quite tasty.   Just as good as the better german examples, and fresher here.

1707,"2009-06-18",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2009 12 ounce bottle - $1.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

""To serve, pour two-thirds into a glass, swirl and pour the rest."" Youre the boss, bottle!

Appearance: Rather well hazed, dull, dark yellow body with a voluminous, lasting, whitish head. Fair amount of gooey lace left on the way down.

Smell: Ah, the unmistakable aroma of wheat malt, replete with some sweet-scented, tangy qualities but also a scent of gently kneaded whole wheat bread dough. Pungent notes of semi-ripe banana and spice with a lesser hint of chewing gum and squeezed lemon.

Taste: Sweetish, tangy malted wheat with a distinct taste of grainy, mealy bread dough. Add in a few freshly-sliced lemon wedges and some dried banana chips. Good dash of earthy ground cloves. Spicy-minded hops with a low, subtle bitterness imparted. Very thin vein of tartness in the last third of the sip. Finishes dry, spicy, with little ""goodbyes"" from the wheat, lemons, and bananas. Nice.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Smooth, somewhat fluffed mouthfeel which has nice depth but also a delightful airiness about it.

Drinkability: Remarkably enjoyable and certainly recommended! It was difficult completing the review before I had greedily gulped this one down. Regretfully, I picked only the one lone single, but Ill be sure to return for a proper six-pack.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
