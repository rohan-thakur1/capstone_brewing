3713,"2011-03-06",3.4,"On tap at Barleys Ale House #1, Columbus OH, March 2010. Attractive copper colour. Good condition. Surprisingly perfumed hop character on the nose. The mix with dry, cereal malt is, however, a little incongruous. Perhaps thats why its called rogue? Dry, slightly dusty, biscuity malt on the palate. More, quite bitter hops in the flavour. Slightly unusual but ends up OK.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
3713,"2010-04-13",3.6,"On tap at the Alehouse. I was beginning to think they poured me the wrong beer until I read some of the other reviews. Aroma is very strong with hops. Citrusy and grassy with some caramel malt in there too. Certainly looks like an Irish red, as its a clear reddish copper with a medium tan head. Flavor is earthy hops and bready malt with a lasting bitter finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
3713,"2010-03-29",3.0,"Pours an amber color with a white head.  Taste of bitter hops, however its kind of flat without much depth.  I would pass on this beer in the future.

3713,"2008-03-27",3.4,"On tap at the alehouse.  Pours a nice amber red color with no head, just white swirls on top.  Nice floral smell, some spicy malt and flowery hops, a little more than I expected within this style.  Taste is smooth, pretty damn full bodied and thick with the a spicy and bitter finish.  Pretty good example of the style.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
3713,"2008-03-23",3.2,"Had at the Alehouse on Firkin. Very sweet smell. Hops and malts. The taste was very light caramel, smoke, malts, brown sugar. Enjoyable to drink, but a bit thin and watery for me.","Pickerington, Ohio, USA","BeerVirgin72"

3713,"2006-03-21",3.6,"On tap at alehouse #1 - Pours bright amber with a creamy offwhite head.  Aroma consists of pleasant floral aroma over grains and caramel malts.  Flavor is surprisingly quite hoppy.  Lots of floral notes, some orange as well, and a touch of grapefruit.  Backed pretty well with caramel malts and some grains as well.  Palate is medium bodied and rather creamy.  Very drinkable and a nice compliment to the food.  I was pleasantly surprised on this one.","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"

3713,"2005-03-05",3.7,"Wasnt expecting much from this one, but I got more than I had bargained for. This beer pours a pale reddish color with almost no head. Looks very watery. Taste is very hoppy with a good malty backing. A little thin and watery, but the hops are done very nicely, better than any other irish ale I have had.","USA","BennyTicklez"
3713,"2004-03-19",3.4,"Draft, comes a clear, reddish color with a small off-white head that diminished to a ring of bubbles.  Sweet malty aroma, smooth sweet flavor with a crisp hop finish.  Medium body and light carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"

3713,"2003-03-27",3.5,"Well with St. Patrick's day nearly upon us, it was time to sample the new batch of Irish Rouge before the bar hoppers on that day drain the cask dry. This beer was an medium reddish amber color and formed an off white bubbly head that left circular lace as it subsided. A subtle aroma of malt and citrus with a slight grain element to it. The flavor was of malt and lightly of cirtrus. The finish had a slight bitterness to it, but nothing overpowering.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
3713,"2002-08-17",3.1,"Not as I expected but far better than I had hoped for.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
3713,"2002-06-11",3.2,"Didnt have the body or head that I expected.  Flavor was a little bitter, but I liked the roasted flavor.  Tiny buttery aftertaste.  A pretty good beer.  I prefer the Russian from Barleys.","California, USA","stephen"
