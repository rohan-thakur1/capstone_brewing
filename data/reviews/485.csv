IOW, smoked/roasted is the dominant aroma with barely a hint of berries underneath. Thick-ish feel, but not a lot of carbonation; has an almost flat feel. Initial taste is smokey with (as with the aroma) just the faintest hint of berry. Bitter hops appear in the middle and linger into the finish. I have to admit, I was aprehensive about a blueberry stout, but I also have to admit that I am a bit disappointed with how subdued the berry is in both the aroma and the taste. Also, the brewer claims 20 IBU, but there is more bittering than that rating would imply. Overall, a middle of the road stout with not enough berry to validate the name.","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"

 Piana:  Początkowo bardzo bujna w cholernie ciemnym beżowym odcieniu.
Dość szybko niestety opadła do znacznej otoczki.
Pojedyńcze zdobienia na Tulipie. 
 Zapach:  Coś nieprawdopodobnego! Jeszcze takiego intensywnego zapachu leśnych borówek nie czułem w żadnym piwie. Prócz tego cała plejada czekoladowych odnośników i lekka paloność. W tle delikatne owoce cytrusowe.
 Smak:  W ogromnej mierze zdominowany przez amerykańske borówki. Smak jest tak sugestywny, że chwilami mam wrażenie jakby całe ich owoce zanurzone były w butelce. Niesamowite uczucie.
Fioletowy owoc wspiera w smaku bardzo solidna kwaskowata kawa i gorzka czekolada.
Stout ma również palony charakter i nawet minimalne sugestie dymnej wędzonki.
Goryczka palona, średniej maści z wytrawnym finiszem. Jagodowa cierpkość jeszcze przez jakiś czas odczuwalna jest na podniebieniu.
Świetna pijalność, ale nie sesyjność.

Bardzo udany produkt w kategorii ciekawostki piwowarskiej.
Niesamowicie zdominowany w smaku i aromacie przez borówki amerykańskie.
Tak intensywnego jagodowego, czy też borówkowego smaku i aromatu nie odnalazłem jeszcze w żadnym piwie.
Ciekawostką jest fakt, że piwo ma dość wytrawny charakter.
Wspomagają go nuty kawy, paloności, subtelnej wędzonki czy gorzkiej czekolady.

This ones a double-edged sword in the nose...on the one hand, Im pleased that the blueberry is obvious, but on the other, its a pretty artificial smelling blueberry smell, like Boo Berry cereal or a blueberry soda. And it is a little overbearing, to be honest. Whereas some other blueberry stouts Ive tried in the past year barely smelled of it at all, this one is a bit over the top. Fruity-tart in mouth and a bit too lastingly sweet...and again, artificial tasting. Not repulsive or anything, but a rather cartoony rendition.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

The appearance was a black color with a slim fingers worth of tan head that quickly died off. Barely any lacing stuck around the glass.
The smell had a nice sweet to roasty blend of sweet blueberry, slight roasty coffee, light vanilla, and bringing in a light cocoa all rounding out a wonderful aroma.
The taste was sweet and slightly roasty bringing in a slight bitter (from the coffee). Lingering slightly roasty coffee aftertaste leads to a quick dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed good for the style and for me.
Overall, as an American Stout it works. The blueberry makes a nice added bonus. Id have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Smells of freshly blended blueberries. Surprised that the blueberries smelled so fresh and not too sweet or artificial. Other aromas are of dark semi sweet chocolate, roasted espresso, and bits of smoked malt. Hops are nowhere to be found and alcohol is hidden well for a stout almost 8%.

Taste is bits of chocolate covered blueberries mixed with a smoked porter. Charred oak and some coffee cut the fruity sweetness. Light bitterness is in the aftertaste and alcohol is barely detected.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied but with a good amount of carbonation. Head died pretty fast, wish it stuck around to cut the carbonation.

485,"2014-04-17",4.0,"Bottled December 2nd and poured March 20th. $2.19 single.

Appearance: Pitch black with a seriously dark brown head that goes down quickly and leaves a small film on top of the beer. No lacing.

Smell: Welp, roast and blueberry. Dark chocolate covered blueberry kind of vibe, but with coffee in there as well. Pleasant to my nose holes. It doesnt smell like a burst of blueberries all over the place, but its clearly there and not in an overbearing fashion.

Taste/feel: First thing I notice without a doubt is the body on this beer -- quite full with only a mildly prickly carbonation on it. The blueberry and other stouty characteristics work incredibly well together. Theres a sweet, slightly sour blueberry character, and then the roasted bitterness. Rather than dominate the beer, the blueberry compliments it very nicely without becoming too much. The blueberry is implemented very well in Tres, and Bells Cherry Stout is looking quite a bit less appetizing (if thats even possible for some people) after having this. The sweetness and sour/tanginess from the blueberries in this beer doesnt leave an unappealing, artificial sort of aftertaste that Bells Cherry Stout does. The aftertaste is very mildly bitter with a blueberry flavor. As a whole, this isnt a bitter beer much at all, thanks to the blueberries. Theres a slight bit of it from the roasted malt, which is to be expected, but its nicely balanced overall. As for the alcohol, not noticeable at all in any way.

One of my new favorites from Dark Horse. Its not often you see a fruit infused stout turn out to be as tasty as this one is. Again, the blueberry is there to accent this beer -- not turn it into fruit juice. If I had any complaint, itd be that Id like it to be a bit more bold on the flavor. More blueberry and more roasty depth. This stuff tastes great as it is, but uhm... maybe an Imperial version, Dark Horse? Just a thought. Definitely try this one out.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

Taste enhances those memories, at least at first, since its quite sweet, with obvious alcohol although relatively low, blueberries are there too, and near the finish the roasted malts appear along with bitter chocolate. Mildly bitter aftertaste with a short duration.
Medium body, good carbonation.
Overall, and memories brought back aside, a great stout.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"
485,"2014-02-12",3.6,"Draft at Lost Dog Dunn Loring. Poured a motor oil black, with a small, brown head on top. Aroma is light blueberries, roasted malts. I was a bit skeptical, as a lot of these blueberry beers taste a tad artificial. Aroma was a check for it being okay, so it was so far, so good. Flavor was an initial blast of blueberry - tasting a bit like a blueberry muffin. Later sips were a lot less blueberry in nature, mostly dark, bitter roasted character. Not too bad.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"

A: Pours a nearly black color, similar to the Too cream stout. Aggressively poured, this features a four-finger tan colored head. Like its brethren, it seriously looks like an imperial stout.

S: There is some unsweetened chocolate and roasted barley here, but beneath that is a slight hint of blueberry. Not enough to kill the balance by any stretch, but enough to interest the olfactory senses.

T: At first, the typical notes of roast, chocolate, and coffee open things up. But then the finish comes, loaded with blueberry. I feel like the blueberry notes do a good job of not getting in the way of the stout qualities - some sips sees the roast/chocolate win out, others see the blueberry as the dominant flavor. Ultimately, the two elements blend together reasonably well.

M: Compared with One and Too, this seems rather thin. This aids drinkability admirably, however it doesnt have the decadent feel of the other two.

O: Not a pure stout, but it works well as a stout/fruit beer hybrid. The blueberry does a good job of blending in with the base, never fully overpowering things. Id gladly drink this one again.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

485,"2013-03-15",3.7,"On tap at Mekong, ordered this one despite the fact that it let me know that it was a blueberry stout.  Poured black.  Aroma was strongly of blueberries - even the people standing next to me could smell it.  Some light chocolate notes as well.  Hits the palate as a medium bodied, slightly sweet stout - stout flavors tend towards chocolate with some faint coffee notes.  The blueberry flavor is less pronounced than in the aroma, but still present - actually quite complimentary.  For some reason, it strikes me as an almost, but not quite, artificial blueberry flavor.  Probably because of the juxtaposition of the fruit notes over the stout notes.  But not bad - for a blueberry stout.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

485,"2013-02-26",3.4,"12 ounce bottle in an American shaker pint. Number three, ""tres,"" of the DH stout lineup. Aroma had no hint of those blueberries. I got a woodsy, soil and smoke aroma. Appearance was pretty weird. It was a dark black and hyperactively foamy. The cap nearly popped off the bottle and then upon pouring it had a soda-like bubble action of rapidly fizzling, dark brown foam on top - not the slow movement foam you usually see on a beer. Taste was comparable to the aroma package: smoke, earth, wood, and dry. Where are those blueberries?! Palate was bubbly at first but it flattens out rapidly. Medium to heavy bodied. It coats your mouth with the smoke and malt resin aspects. Overall, this one fits in with the Dark Horse smoky stout herd. I like how they have five different stouts that each take a slightly different approach, but the differences are subtle enough to make me either do a side by side comparison, or just come to the conclusion that the labels are the biggest difference among the bunch.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

485,"2013-01-11",2.6,"Wasnt sure about this one but worth a try. Pours pitch black with a brown one finger head. Really gorgeous pour. Aroma not helping me want to drink this. I can tell it is a mix of blueberry and chocolate, but really, it kind of smells like vomit (by kind of, I mean it literally smells like last nights dinner coming back for an encore). Just weird. Luckily, the flvaor starts out okay. Not much blueberry going on to start, but the flavor is very roasty with hints of chocolate. Definite bitterness--not expected at this level from a sweet stout--and there are definitely hops here. Slight tinge of blueberry. Roasty smokey aftertaste with some cocoa. 

As I get through it a bit more the blueberry really starts coming out on the finish, and then all the way through. This just ends up becoming an all blueberry beer. Sweeter and sweeter as I go. Ultimately a drainpour. I just cant deal with this one. Admittedly, I am not a huge blueberry fan anyway.

Higher carbonation for a stout, which keeps it a bit lighter than It actually is on the palate. Overall I guess they hit what they were going for. But need to work on that truly effed up aroma pI would think even for those who are blueberry fans. Certainly different and interestingly complex, but not for me.

Midnight black, with no light escaping anywhere. It arrived with a thin tan head, which receded to the edge of the glass and left slight lacing on the way down.

Strong roasted coffee and chocolate malt is the dominant aroma; blueberry provides a secondary presence on the nose.

Surprisingly bitter all the way through. The coffee and chocolate start off strong with a dark roasted malt back, adding a light but firm blueberry taste. A touch of cigars in the middle, and the coffee is the taste left standing at the end. A fairly strong bitter aftertaste as well.

Smooth and creamy, a good fit for this stout.

Waves of roasty sweet stout with undertones of blueberry pie, however, the blueberry does not dominate the palate - much better balance than other fruit stouts Ive had. About 10 seconds after swallowing, you are left with a little bit of puckering and drying from the blueberries. Overall, fantastic beer.

Wow, a deep brown to black pour, a deep black beer in the glass with a nice vast but small brown head. The head seems to slowy change into a vast brown lacing.
Incredible smell, lots of blueberries but nothing to crazy here with something like ""too much blueberries"".
The smell however is mostly dominated by the blueberries, but there are also traces of (deeper roasted) coffee, hops, (deep) roasted malts and something light sour which most likely comes from the blueberries.
The taste is subtle, soft, smooth but also deep and complex but on a very generous way. A nice coffee and roasted almost burned malty/barley taste with (instead of a vanilla) a nice blueberry touch. The blueberries are added correctly, the exact amount this stout should have.
There is a nice bitterness that seems to stay there for a long while but never seems to fade or get stronger.
The aftertaste is soft roasty with a roasted herby/grassy/light grainy touch and a good bitterness.
The blueberries seem to take this beer to a softer side. Still delicious!
The carbonation is is pretty low with a light growing light spicy/sparkling mouthfeel (still mostly on the softer side), full body and a creamy texture.

Not bad on the feel, pretty good with a smoky, roasty, burnt aftertaset with just a tinge of sweet blueberry finish.  Odd, but tasty!  Would be a good conversation piece for a tasting.

Pitch black with a short brown head that doesnt lace.
Sweet aroma with chocolate and a big fruity blueberry note that reminds me of blueberry bubblegum. The aroma gets a bit more acidic ashy after a while with just a hint of cold coffee and some licorice.

Taste is lactic sweet and a bit acidic with a nice smooth blueberry note and an ashy roasted character. But then comes the aftertaste with a big nice dark chocolate flavor and strong cold coffee.

485,"2012-01-10",4.1,"A. Pours a nice black, with a mild blue hue. A nice 2 finger head, with good retention. Maintained a nice 2mm ring the whole time.

S. Noticeable hickory/oak notes, with a sweet smell of blueberry and malts. Extremely nice smell to this beer. This is the type of smell that I could have a scented candle made out of, that my wife would like too. 

T. Start has a rich malt flavor. A slight blueberry flavor, but also very sweet. The sweetness fades at the end to a bitterness. Almost as if your tasting two different types of blueberries through out the beer. It really is quite a interesting transformation.

M. It has a heavier feel, that presents itself right away when you sip it. A chewy thickness that stays bold the whole time. However the flavors round out the thickness well. A fair amount of carbonation, however not overwhelming.

O. This is a very interesting beer. Without the blueberry flavors, this beer would be lost on a shelf with a lot of other 1-sided stouts. However the flavors that present themselves throughout this beer really keep it interesting all the way through the glass, and even after your done drinking.

I think this is a impressive beer. It has some flavors that normally would be the end of a stout to me, but rounds them out with a lot of interesting angles to the taste. It really keeps you sipping to continue to get all those subtle hints. On a nice side note, when you burp, it tastes like blueberry pancakes! I cant wait to share this beer with a few friends.","Minnesota, USA","MBrausen"

It has the most wonderful man-made aroma Ive ever smelled, with lots of blueberry, leading my thoughts to pancakes, coffee, chocolate and dried fruits as well as hints of alcohol and something sugary. Its almost equally superb in the mouth, which after minutes of satisfaction to the nose finally got a sip. Its sweet and malty, slightly roasted and caramel-ish and roasted-bitter. Blueberries are present, but not as intense as in the aroma, and theres also chocolate and coffee. Its full-bodied and smooth, with the finish lasting long after the final drop has been swallowed.

485,"2011-03-30",2.6,"12oz bottle poured into my De Struise glass...A dark brown body with a huge dark tan head that rises several fingers. There is incredible lacing and retention...The aroma is very strong, as I wait for the head to fall fresh blueberries start to waif over rom a few feet away. Weirdly, as I get closer the aroma lets me down as the blueberries come off more generic and chemical. Also quite a bit of alcohol for a 4.5% beer. Weird bitter note too that are hops, totally inappropriate... The taste is really weird and boring. The blueberries come off as bitter, only a hint of sweet blueberries. There is a strange medicinal note, aloe, light very bitter, hop finish. Not very interesting or good enough that I want to keep drinking.

tastes extremely of roasted barley, very toasty... almsot like burnt toast. small hints of blueberry, not as much as i thought there would be. heavy hits of black pepper the more i drink, yuck.

Definitely some dried blueberry flavor, but its in the background and not overwhelming. As the blueberries fade, its replaced by a lingering dried cocoa taste, charcoal and some molasses flavors.  Medium bodied, with a creamy milky mouthfeel to it. Id classify this a well-done gimmicky type beer.

485,"2011-02-20",3.7,"Blueberries seem like a good match for beer. They always seem to pop through and add quite a lot of aroma w/o being artificial. Well, at least they are better than cherry and most other fruit. This beer pours a completely opaque black w/ a pretty red-brown head. Blueberries strike the nose as soon as the bottle is cracked and remain pretty intense in the glass. Their flavor mingles w/ deep roasted coffee and it comes together in a way that manages to be both unique and classic. Taste is a bit on the tart side, which emphasizes the fruit more so than the stout tastes but w/o completely overriding the chocolate and coffee overtones. Texture, too, veers more towards what youd expect in a lighter fruit beer. It is light bodied but not thin w/ prickly carbonation.

Roasty with a light sweetness and rich chocolates and caramels. A light blueberry stays in the background with a touch of acidity from the berries. A much more distinct peat with a hint of tobacco smoke. Finishes dry and roasty with a bit of a spice and a light sweetness.

You can definitely pick up the blueberry in the nose, along with licorice and alcohol.  The roasted malt character is lost a bit in the aroma and the taste, which is again licorice and blueberry, as well as  some chocolate and coffee.

485,"2009-12-18",3.9,"Bottle. These guys need to update this label a little... Pours murky thick black, with minimal head formation. Had to pour rather vigorously for anything to show up. Still, though, the little head thats there is dark and pretty. Nose is great - chocolate covered blueberries and a little coffee. Calling this a dry stout is accurate - the sweetness is quite low. Roasted barley directs the flavor, and theres a nice little blueberry undercurrent. Minimal hopping - some bitterness is present, but its from the roasted malt, not hops. This is a very nice stout, and certainly an idea Ive never come across before. I feel it might be a little bit too dry - maybe a tad more sweetness would add to the blueberry flavor. An enjoyable brew, though.","Houston, Texas, USA","jumpjet2k"

485,"2009-11-23",3.8,"( 12oz bottle thanks to bobby91w and sprinkle) Pours a pitch black color that is somewhat viscous, oily, nice 1 finger head but recedes as quickly as soda head. No real lacing on the glass to speak of either, but looks nice for the style. The smell is a nice complex mixture of coffee, dark chocolate, and blueberries, but the blueberries stand out just a LITTLE bit too much. Reminiscent of blueberry muffins, almost buttery even. Taste starts off coating the tongue with dark chocolate, perhaps some burnt toast! Blueberries assault the middle of your tongue. There is a little more bitterness than I like in stouts here, maybe from some hops? Not sure really. Perhaps its too much cocoa flavor for me; like unsweetened chocolate. There is a lot going on here really. The finish lingers with the bitterness a bit. The mixture of stout and blueberries is a pretty ingenious combination and its well done here. So thick and perfect, really nice carbonation, thick and viscous, needs to be creamier though and a little slicker/oily to be perfect.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

485,"2009-08-31",3.6,"12oz bottle.Pours a menacing dark brown-black with saddle-soap-colored head that leaves nice lacing throughout the inside of the glass. Aroma is bitter-roasted grain, dark chocolate, and of course, blueberries. Flavor is also bitter from the roasted grains but has little of the charcoal flavor that so many craft-brew stouts seem to aim for (and lacking this is a good thing IMO). There is some sweetness from the malt and presumably the blueberries to keep the bitterness in check. Speaking of the blueberries, I was skeptical about a blueberry stout, thinking that a judicious dose of blueberry flavor would be the only way it could work. And thats exactly what they have done here -- just enough to let you know the blueberries are there but not trying to ""take over"" the flavor. Any more of the blueberry flavor and I dont think this would have worked. Body is full with a thick, almost oily palate. This would have been a solid stout without the blueberries, and adding blueberry flavor could have ruined it not handled properly. Thankfully, it was handled properly.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Its not really all too sweet, and certainly doesnt have that artificial blueberry flavor which is great.  With time, and as the beer warms it sort of begins to taste like a blueberry soda of some sort.  I really enjoy this stout because its not too heavy, and is really really accessible.

The aromas reminded me of a blueberry coffee, being from Maine yes there is such an animal. There is a slight chocolate smell as well but once I thought of the blubbery coffee I pretty much kept coming back to that. The flavors are toward the smoked side with slight blueberry fruit sweetness to it had a medium to full feel in my mouth with a slight carbonation.

Flavor is actually quite dry: chocolaty roast malt with a bit of a fruity tartness and a long, lingering smoky finish. The bluberries are definitely there, but as a more of a nuance than a strong flavor. This works remarkably well.  Medium thick, creamy mouthfeel.

Beneath is a very biting blueberry tart note that adds a whole new level to the aroma. Flavor starts with a nice soft blueberry sweetness rounded with a nice malty body. Mmmmm liquid sweet blueberry muffin. Through the swallow the blueberry flavor loses ground to a bitter or bakers chocolate and ever so slight hop presence. Regains a bit of blueberry tartness in the swallow and lingers along with the dark malt, much like a blueberry dark chocolate. Medium to full body and mild carbonation.

Poured a deep black color with a almost nonexistent brown head. The aromas consisted of bitter chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts, and sugary malts. As the beer warmed I could smell some blueberries but nothing overwhelming. The taste was very common of a stout; chocolate and roasty with very faint hints of blueberry.

How: Bottle 12oz, age unknown.  From HogtownHarry, thanks a lot Harry.
The look: Black body topped by a tan ring of foam
In long: Nose is highly roasted, some black coffee and only a little hint of blueberries.  Taste has the blueberries more upfront and adds molasses and chocolate notes to the black coffee and highly roasted flavours detectable from the nose.  Body is full, carbonation is lively.  The beer has an overall dry sensation.  I was very much intrigued by this beer and Im glad I got to try it.  The result was not as good as I hopped nor was it as bad as I feared, so I was both relieved and saddened, like the time I peed myself in my favourite jeans.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

This is the last of the stout series for me and this one pours just like the rest, pitch black with a bubbly mocha head that dissipates to a ring.  There is little lacing but lots of bubbles rising to the middle throughout.  Aroma is surprising for a stout as it smells like a blueberry cobbler with some coffee and chocolate malts thrown in.  Fascinating smell.  The taste isnt quite as nice as the aroma but still good with the dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolates dominating.  The blueberries are present but not overwhelming, making for a nice, balanced flavor.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation and leaves the palate tingling.  This is right up there with Plead the 5th in the series and this one may win for originality.  Great beer and the best sessionable stout I’ve tasted in a while.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Definite charcoal, roast, and dark chocolate with the requisite blueberry flavor, but only in the finish - and less so than in the aroma.  The blueberries aren’t intuitive with this recipe, which make it both a subtle success and a baffling experiment.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

This brew smells like a warm piece of blueberry pie sitting beside a warm cup of coffee. Personally, I was hoping for more fresh blueberry aroma. The taste was surprising given the nose. The blueberry flavor was very subtle and almost non-existent. Espresso was the strongest flavor, but it was mingled with coffee and bitter chocolate in the background.

Palate is well above average...very creamy and extremely smooth.  Slight bitterness towards the end was a bit odd, but didnt detract much.

485,"2008-08-03",3.8,"Bottle, aged for a few months. Ah, the last of the four that I haven’t rated yet. Pours an opaque jet-black with mild viscosity. The head is a dark burgundy that fades quickly and seems to be rather difficult to stir up. The aroma is of fresh, juicy blueberries with some lightly smoked woody notes. Some dark chocolate is noticeable. It’s rather oily to the tongue with some acidic tinges. The initial flavour is dominant in blueberries, but not overpowering. It’s graciously assertive. The front of the palate enjoys the nice, mellow blueberries as the centre starts to notice some more of the mildly smoked woody notes. The back of the palate, however, is assaulted with a bitter dark chocolate. As the smoked flavours increase, it quickly gravitates towards the back of the palate making the bitterness escalate. The blueberries are the first to fade. Smoke fades quickly as the bitterness overcomes it. The bitterness at the back of the tongue lasts for a long time. As the astringency fades, the wood notes prevail. Subtle cocoa and even more subtle blueberry is a nice addition to this somewhat dry finish. This is such a unique experience. Because its assault to the back of the palate, I feel to thoroughly enjoy it, one must give each sip some time for the palate to reset itself. Now, from my previous experiences of this beer (which were more fresh), I hardly remember the astringency towards the back of the palate, and the blueberries were definitely much more intense. It’s hard to say which I liked better. However, I can say that aged for a few months, the experience becomes rather interesting.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"
485,"2008-07-30",3.9,"The aroma is particularly good on this stout; there is a lot of fresh blueberry aroma, along with nutty, chocolaty, and yeasty aromas to compliment. The beer pours with a very deep black color and a head that stays around the rim of the glass leaving a swirl on top of the beer. From the smell I expected this to be very fruity, which in it’s own right it is, however not in an alcipop sort of way. The initial flavors are of a very strong and bitter stout. Flavors that hit the tongue right off the bat are a little overwhelming but very nice to pick through. The blueberry introduces the beer at the tip of the tongue while strong flavors of wood and dark roasted coffee take over. The back of the tongue gets a deep almost burnt malt flavor which dances well with the hop bitterness. The flavors are so intense that it reminds me of an imperial stout! The palate is almost bizarre as the beer slides across your tongue but is somewhat harsh going down. Overall this is absolutley worth a try (or even a case)","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

I think the combination of the roasted malts and blueberry flavoring or whatever was used just doesn’t work at all.

ours dark as india ink, making me wonder about the ABV until I tasted it.

L: The darkest of impenetrable blackish browns with a nice fluffy tan chocolate head that ever so slowly sank into a thin sudsy skim. A light amount of splotchy lace rings the top of the glass. This blueberry stout is off to a good looking start.

S: Deep roasted, slight burnt, barley malt aromas, charcoal, coffee, chocolate, nuts and grain with a soft underlining of sweetly tart blueberries. Further whiffs put in blueberry estery alcohol.

F&T: Moderate bodied with a silky creaminess, this has a nice velvety drinkability. Deep roasted malt flavors with a little roasted bitterness in the finish. Malty tastes of dark chocolate, cocoa powder, molasses and charred nuts, ending with a good roasted dark coffee bitterness. Mildly tart blueberries in the middle helps to cut some of the roasted malts bark. A quite light citric hop in the finale, along with the mildly tart blueberries, add a touch of sourness to the sugary coffee finish.

485,"2008-03-22",3.2,"12 oz. bottle. Blueberry / blueberry pie / blueberry syrup unmistakable in the first sniff. Aroma also features dry, roasted coffee bean and dark chocolate scents. The blueberry and classic stout smells work surprisingly well together. Pours a very dark, almost black color with a miniscule amount of dark tan head. No lacing. Simple but cool appearance. The taste features a stout start with a blueberry finish. The blueberry flavor comes in a sugared, treated form, like blueberry syrup or blueberry jam. Heavily roasted malt taste. A tartness develops upon multiple sips. This is too coffee-like by my standards, and yet the blueberry presence is excessively fruit-sweet. This beer takes some getting used to, and Im up and down on the taste. Long, roasted coffee-bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body. Not bad in the palate but completely forgettable. Dark Horse Tres is a very interesting beer with an unusual aroma, appearance, and flavor. I dont think the blueberry stout concept works very well here in the flavor, but I like the idea in general. This is a challenging beer both to the palate and to the throat (that is, its hard to analyze and hard to drink). Nonetheless, I respect what Dark Horse is trying to do with this product, and I am awarding an extra point in the overall score for uniqueness. I rarely recommend a beer that I give only a 3.2 rating, but I do suggest that people try this fascinating brew if they get the chance.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

485,"2008-02-21",4.0,"Pours an absolutely opaque, pitch black body.  A spongy, chocolate brown head settles slowly to a thin film, leaving rings of skinny lacing behind at first, followed by sudsy lacing that mostly rejoins the body.  The aroma shows roasted coffee, cream, dark cocoa, and blueberry pancakes that stuck to the griddle for about one minute too long.  A sweet bready, pancake batter component makes this one the perfect breakfast beer.  The blueberry component is fresh, not artificial like most fruit beers are.  The flavor shows scorched blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes.  A light smokiness shines though, with a caramel infused syrup drizzle.  I cannot emphasize enough how great a breakfast beer this would make. The medium-full mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  Finishes roasty, with a lingering blueberry and chocolate finish.

485,"2008-02-05",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2009 Best smelling beer Ive had so far. Smells EXACTLY like a blueberry muffin or blueberry pancakes. Nothing too special about the appearance, dark black with maybe tint of blue. Flavor was good, really good, but the aroma got me so jazzed that I expected much more of a blueberry flavor to this one. The blueberry flavor in this one is comparable to the cherry flavor in Bells Cherry Stout, but it certainly adds to the flavor. No bitter aftertase, nice hints of chocolate and malt. The blueberry is there, just not as much as I wanted it to be. Still, a fantastic beer!","Indiana, USA","StFun"

485,"2008-01-20",4.1,"12oz Bottle. Awesome fresh blueberry aroma. All the seeds, stem, flesh and skin of wild blueberries coalesces with a real refined stout character. Light coffee, bright dusty dark cocoa, and lightly cooked blueberries. Pours deep black with a quickly rising rim of hot chocolate tan foam. Probably one of the darkest heads Ive ever seen. Flavor is right on spot two. Man, the blueberries and the stout work hand in hand. A big part of this is that this is an awesome stout, even without the blueberries. And its not all in your face blueberries. Its a subtle, earthy fruit. Just like wild. Great roasted character, subtle saltiness, and then a very mild blueberry skin approach. A glimmer of hops provides depth to the beer. Carbonation is on point. Fresh. A great stout, paired with the perfect amount of the right fruit. Excellent!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

485,"2008-01-11",3.9,"[Bottle, thanks Guerde] Pours dark brown with a small dark tan head. Aroma is blueberry, roasted malt, coffee, maple syrup and a little alcohol. Taste is blueberry up front which slowly transforms into a charred malt taste that then dominates. The charred taste got to be a little too much after awhile, but still pretty good. Medium-mouthfeel with a fairly long, dry finish. A good and unique beer, but the heavily charred taste just isnt something I usually like much in my beers.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
485,"2008-01-05",4.4,"The blueberry in this stout, through and through, is just magical. It doesnt just resemble a blueberry flavor, it tastes and smells like fresh freaking blueberry pie. Unreal. Hats off to Dark Horse for this wonderful beverage. Proof that a fruit beer can be much more than just a fruit beer. The blueberry, while unique, offers the perfect contrast to what is already a marvelous stout. The way the flavors bounce and play off each other is so interesting, so complex, yet so quaffable and so downright plain old fun to drink! An ingenious beer from an ingenious brewery. Fantastic.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","santos999"
485,"2008-01-04",4.4,"What an interesting beer.  While this was still cold my impression was that what you need to know about this beer in order to understand it is how big the underlying stout is: thick, black (yellow edging), opaque, rich, roasty, chocolately, just really deep with all of those big stout qualities.  In that formation you get the blueberry from the nose and the finish, but are overwhelmed by ""Imperial Stout"" in the middle.  As it warmed fully, you could get the blueberry all over, including the delightful swish that made for a subtle but elegantly fruity note.  It is like an Impy that has that plum/port quality going, only...just a bit different.  Thick, viscous, low alcohol but you want to assume it has to be big (it isnt)...what a marvelous job of brewing.  A real triumph for what it is.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
485,"2008-01-03",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2008 Pours with a velvety texture to an oily, thick black body; a thin pond of tanned marshmallow foam rests easy.  Blueberry aroma lunges out excitedly with the first crack of the cap and breathes more calmly with dark vinous depth once poured; ethereal, tangible sumatran dark roast, prunes, black licorice and moist earth lend a dense, approachable sophistication.  Really a beautiful aroma.  Damp and tannic flavor of blueberries lingers heavily on the astringency of black and roasted malt, warming steadily into a pleasant, delicate counterpoint of excessive bitterness and excessive fruitiness; hints of browned banana, french roast, vanilla cola, currant and maple wood.  Smoky and wet, with a hint of steamed vegetable creeping in on the back.  Detailed despite its understated character in terms of size, and even a bit tightly wound with fruit and sugar, so as to suggest that it might even age well for a year or two.  Fluffy palate pushes the boundary of viscous; softly carbonated, and sweetly coating, giving way to a lightly acrid peaberry and tannin finish.  Rich, lucid, and leaving a polished impression; well done.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

The bottom of the bottle however,  had a lot of sediment in it, much more than Ive ever seen in any bottle.  After that, I poured it and the aroma was beautiful!  Strong blueberry, chocolate, malt, roasted malt, coffee and a hint of smoke.  Poured pure black with a dark tan with purple very, very large foamy head that slowly receded into a thick, creamy cap. Very impressive lloking. Left nice lacing on pint. Taste was fantastic!  Starts out with a slight chocolate flavor followed by beautiful blueberry, then malt, coffee, touch of smoke, touch of slightly burnt roasted malt, followed by more blueberry. Very good!  Body is medium, texture slightly thicker than medium and creamy. After the initial foam over, the very large head I expected it to be overly carbonated But, it was average, much to my surprise.  The finish is dry, pleasantly robust with slight bitter and short.  Very good!  I really enjoyed the beer even though it foamed all over me out of the bottle.  LOL.... Seriously, it is one very excellent stout.  Very complex, very tasty, very smooth, very creamy.  A excellent stout!  Great job by Dark Horse.

Smooth mouthfeel. As jerc notes, the blueberry seems subdued in the flavour at first - notes of roast malt, chocolate, coffee and smoke are more prominent - but we were snacking on brownies while drinking this, and the chocolate really brought the blueberry forward - so much so that I could taste it even once we started on the next beer of the tasting. Very unique, and very good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"

When smelling from the glass, I got roasted malts and chocolate, with the blueberries coming in at the end.  Really beautiful.  The taste was great, with some chocolate hittin the tongue first, followed by blueberries, whose sweetness cut into the roasty bitterness rather well.

(3+) Surprising amout of sweet blueberry pie-like fruit in the aroma is quite lovely as it preceds a less impressie moderate roasty malt character. The flavour starts with dry roasty malt, with the blueberry of the aroma fading to a distant secondary character. Intriguingly, a bite of a chocolate brownie mid glass seems to bring out the blueberry character of the beer more. Unexpected!

Theres just a hint of dark roasted malt in the mix, but the blueberries and chocolate dominate the nose. Nice. Medium-bodied and softly effervescent with a pleasant roasted finish.

But it’s not the smell of those crappy ones they use at IHOP or anything; these actually smell real and natural. The dark, almost rounded taste of the berry is well suited for the way some stouts veer away from bitters into a nice yeast/malt combo - and Tres is certainly one of those.

At first I didnt quite catch the blueberry in the aroma, instead focusing on the roasted maltiness and chocolate edges. Shortly thereafter, I caught a strong whiff of the berries, which seemed more soapy than fruity. Interesting, though. Additional notes of wildflowers.  Flavor is an oddity with milk chocolate and berries and coffee roasts all clashing together at once. Each becomes more discernable in the aftertaste, at times very bitter and almost wooden, at times sugary sweet. Cherry, mint and even strawberry stouts I can understand, but Ive never had chocolate-covered blueberries and I think I now know why. It doesnt really ""go""... does it? Ah, well.

It may be my imagination but it seems like theres a hint of blue in the head. The smallish head falls fairly quickly to a swirling. The swirling is menacing moving slowly along the top of this black hole of a body. 

The smell is really something unique. Its fresh and bold with notes of molasses, freshly ground coffee and a blueberry sweetness. The blueberry is mild but you know its there and adds a really nice touch. Toward the end a freshly ground black pepper spiciness shows up. Again, very unique and inviting.

The flavor is much the same as the aroma but without the molasses. First up is a hint of bittersweet chocolate but quickly taken over by the bright, bold freshly ground coffee. It reminds me of some of the chilled coffee thats around. Then the spiciness of the black pepper and the faint blueberry come through. Finishes mildly bitter with coffee grounds. A big flavored, bright beer.

The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium. Smooth and creamy body that works slowly through the mouth. Very nicely done.

This beer can be sipped on all night long. Especially on a cold night like tonight. I dont usually give stouts such a high mark for drinkability but Tres deserves it. 

This beer surprised me. It sounded interesting before I even picked it up but after drinking a few it really is a wonderful beer. I didnt think there would be anyway it would score this well from me. Im picking this up every time I see it anywhere.

485,"2007-05-24",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2012 Not too shabby.  I was a little hesitant due to not having good experiences with deliberate fruit-flavored stouts.  Pours an oily black with no head and a slight amber ring around the top.  The blueberries stand out in the aroma along with some chocolate and coffee.  The first taste of this kind of threw me.  It was all coffee and no blueberries, not necessarily bad but different.  Beyond that first taste I was able to pick up the blueberries initially and it would tail off to a malty, coffee finish with just a little bit of a mocha taste.  All in all, a decent session brew.

Re-rate:  Newly released batch...Damn this is a fine brew.  Aroma consists of heavily roasted malt, some chocolate and a bit of espresso bean....none of which can stake its claim like the natural pressed blueberry aromas...amazing!!  Slick body and palate, flavors are dark chocolate and fresh blueberry...simple enough, yet effective as hell.","Ft Wayne, Indiana, USA","bdigital"
485,"2007-05-24",3.2,"Definite smell of blueberries - tasting them is a different story.  I tasted coffee more than anything else, although I did get a hint of blueberry at the end of each sip.  Pours a thick chocolate color, with no head, or, virtually, no head.  Thick mouthfeel, and it burns the nose slightly.  Im not sure Im a fan of Stout, so, that may cloud my judgement a little.  I can drink this, which says something - I used to not drink dark beers at all.","Flint, Michigan, USA","tarsparky"
485,"2007-05-24",3.9,"Tres has a great aroma of natural blueberry.  I havnt had many blueberry beers but this is the best so far.  Good roasted malt flavor, just a little sweetness and more blueberry.  Full palate and quie good overall.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
485,"2007-05-20",3.2,"12-oz. Thanks, SecretSanta! Pours an opaque black with virtually no head. Whats there is a dark orangey tan ring of foam. Kinda watery looking. Plenty of blueberry on the nose, followed by roast and chocolate. Medium attack, some body there and some carb but neither of them are remarkably abundant or scarce. More of a forwardly roasty flavor with a blueberry finish than the other way around. Some hollow, nutty hop on the finish along with the berries. Interesting beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

pours a very dark black with an aroma of dark chocolate and blueberries.  flavor was the same.  even though I thought this sounded good, the mix of the blueberries with the dark roast of the stout, didnt do it for me.  not bad, just kind of an odd flavor combination.","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"

485,"2007-05-19",3.6,"Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Rileys Wines of the World in Madison, WI. Pours a near opaque dark brown, near black, brew with a dark tan head. Excellent lacing. Aroma is blueberries, even at a distance away as I poured for   our guests. Close up aroma has chocolate, some mocha, roasted barley malt, and mild fruit. Taste is a little gritty, carbonated, and lighter than the first two Dark Horse stouts. Finish is sweet at first and then slightly bitter. The aroma is better than the taste. Reminds me of going out for pancakes the next morning.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
485,"2007-05-16",3.7,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Purchased from Rileys Wines of the World in Madison, WI.  Pours a dark black, opaque color with a thick layer of medium bubbled, well sustaining, roasted tan head.  Upon opening the bottle, my nostils were immediately flooded with an enticing blueberry aroma.  From the glass, wafts a juicy plume of wild blueberry perfume, dripping with late summer juice in that tannin-richness that can only be found in wild blueberries.  Behind the blueberries lay some light molasses and dark chocolate, but the blueberries are the heavily weighted aromatic dominance.  Beautiful, but Id like to see some more malty character strength to balance it out a bit.  Light to medium bodied, sparkling carbonation mouthfeel.  Im actually a bit surprised by the thinness of the mouthfeel; it would be nice to have a bit more chewiness on the palate.  After the juicy aroma, I was expecting greatness from the flavor, but instead I got average.  Blueberries and light roast coffee that linger together long into the finish.  Tastes pretty good, but Im left waiting for more flavor profiles to develop and they never do.  I really feel this beer would be spectacular with a bit more malt complexity to back it up.  Instead, its just a pretty good dry stout with a great blueberrry aroma and average blueberry flavor.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
485,"2007-05-16",3.5,"Duane shared a 12 oz. bottle of this.  Dark pour with almost no head.  Aroma was of blueberries and roasted malt.  Flavor was the same.  Very light, tart blueberry flavor along with the roasty, chocolaty flavors of the stout.  Good beer, but the combination of tartness and roastiness was a bit odd.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"
485,"2007-05-15",4.1,"Bottle courtesy of artusory, many thanks again! Nice black pour with a somewhat fizzy tan head, as usual a nice start for a DH stout. Letting the brew warm a little I get a nice whiff of blueberry muffins...some dark chocolate, roasted malts...some light sour coffee as well. The blueberry/malt element seem to stand out the most..but overall the aroma was fairly light. THe flavor seemded to have a bit more punch with juicy blueberry, roasty malts, dry dark chocolate...even some vinous elements come out in this one...a nice mix between savory and dry which makes this this one a winner for the evening of a hot day. Medium/somewhat thick body with a present yet soft carbonation. Roasty, toasty, juicy, and a bit bittersweet in and out until it comes to a head to the fruity/roasty/dry finish. Another exceptional stout from Dark Horse...if the rumors ARE true and this brewey is going to distro to Ohio...well... call me excited. As the beer warms the roastiness of the aroma ssems to stand out more as the fruit subsides. Real nice brew.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

Taste is full with chocolate, nutmeg, cinnamon,  coffee (didnt smell any of it, weird), roasted malts, and some fruitiness in the end but it would be hard for me to decipher blueberries.

The aroma is Blueberry, roasted malt, and dark chocolate sweetness in that order.  Surprisingly, the taste not big Blueberry, more of a roasty stout with Blueberry highlights.

Light fruit in the aroma and I actually believe blueberry.  Semi-sweet and cream to the nose.  The flavor is light blueberry fruit at the very beginning.  Toasted/roasted grain come fast behind it with semi-sweet malt and perhaps some light chocolate or nougat.  Semi-dry medium body.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

485,"2007-04-10",3.9,"12 oz bottle. Thick, oily pour. Opaque black with a thick brown head. Attractive aroma of chocolate and distinct blueberry with a whiff of burnt stick. Slightly sweet and fruity on the tongue. Pretty unique pairing of roasty and chocolatey malt with just the right amount of blueberry flavor. Full bodied and delicious. Kind of like coffee and blueberry pie.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
485,"2007-04-04",3.3,"This stout actually displays some purple highlights as it pours into the glass.  A thick, mocha head rises above the ebony body.  Freshly mashed blueberries and sweet apple immediately rise from the glass.  A deeper breath reveals a gentle layer of roasted malt and espresso beneath.  The blueberry initiates a splash of tart lemon that matches a citrusy hoppiness in the start.  The malt profile takes control from here, riding this out with lots of smoke, dark chocolate and chalky coffee.  An interesting combo, but blueberries and roasted malt arent my favorite mix.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"
485,"2007-04-04",3.4,"I like Bells Cherry Stout. And I like Atlantic Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale. I can appreciate this stout  the blueberries are there as is the roasty aroma and taste. But roasted, smoked, peaty blueberries? The combination didnt work for me as well as it apparently does for most others. The aroma is big on blueberries. Behind it is smoke and peat. The pour is a black body below a creamy, large tan head. The flavor presents moderate sweetness and a slight bitterness. Dry finish. Medium body and a slightly sticky texture.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
485,"2007-04-03",3.5,"Aquired via trade with Styles. As soon as I popped the cap it was instant blueberry and malt aroma and just maybe a touch of smoke.

Sure is different.","Eau Claire, Wisconsin, USA","buckybeer"

485,"2007-04-02",3.9,"Pours pitch oil black with almost no head.  The blueberries are definitely dominant in the smell, mixed in with the typical stout characters, chcoclate, dark malts, roastiness, etc.  Taste has some blueberry in it for sure, but not as heavy as in the nose.  Mixes pretty well with the rest of the stout characteristics.  I think blueberry is a great fruit to incorporate into a stout.

485,"2007-03-19",3.9,"12 oz bottle thanks to BigErn, thanks a lot Sean.  A bit of sludge on the inside of the mouth, nice.  As I pop the cap I can smell blueberry, I like.  Poured completely black with zero clarity throughout the pour.  No head and just a tad of brown lacing.  Aroma is moderate with light stout roastiness, light coffee, and a sweet berry aroma that comes in at the end.  Taste is a bit empty at the start but the light roastiness kicks in near the end with a perfect sweet blueberry aftertaste.  Low bitterness and average carbonation.  Downsides: a bit thin and not enough initial flavor.  The blueberry is just how I would want it but I would like a fuller stronger stout in general, still very good though.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

485,"2007-03-03",4.0,"Pours dark brown with a light brown head that turns tan as the head develops and sustains itself.  Smells strongly of blueberries initially, but they seem to drop off and disappear after the initial pour.  Smells of coffee, cocoa, pepper and some dark fruit as the beer settles and warms.  Tastes of chocolate, coffee and spices.  Blueberry flavor is there, but is very subtle and easy to overlook.  Finishes slightly metallic with subtle spice and chocolate.  Even though this isnt as blueberry as Id like it to be, it has a lot of depth and is very enjoyable for a dry stout.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
485,"2007-03-03",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2007 Bottle.  Loads of blueberry aroma mixed in with a hearty amount of dry roast and lesser chocolate.  Opaque, motor oil body with an extremely dark brown and volatile ephemeral head.  Taste is predominately a dry roast but the strong blueberry is blended in nicely and plays quite a role in the aftertaste, which is also very dry and chocolatey with notes of toffee and gritty roast.  Big cheers to DH for achieving such a natural blueberry taste - well-integrated and as far from cloying as is possible.  Bittersweet with moderate, stouty carbonation.  Smooth, fullish body.   Very robust flavor for its abv.  A well-conceived and well-executed experiment ... one of the more interesting beers Ive had this year.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

I had this beer on draft at Romans.

It was a dark black color, completely opaque.  Head was nude-pantyhose tan, with a hint of blue in some of the larger bubbles.  Aroma was toasted malt and blueberries.  Taste is a decent amount of ""burned pizza crust"" (which I dig) with an appropriate amount of blueberry flavor.  I wouldnt think fruitiness and toastiness would play well together, yet they do.

Its a really great aroma, the berries work with the beer. Drinking this is interesting. The blueberries act with the dark malts to dry things out.

485,"2007-01-29",4.0,"A: Pours like many stouts, a nice inky brown/black with very little head. Keeps swirling along the top of the mug after a bit, hardly any lacing at all. Looks nice if you like stouts, wont make you drool with desire if you dont.

S: Considering that this is a fruit/veggie beer, the smell/scent of blueberries is not as overpowering as it could have been, though its definitely there. After those first initial whiffs, its more of a ""standard"" stout smell (roasted cocao, dark fruits, etc.).

T: Okay, Im not sure how to approach this one. As far as it being a tasty stout, it most certainly is, but there is very, very little actual blueberry flavor IMO. It is far more attuned toward a quality roasted stout, with hints of cocoa, dessert fruits (I suppose this is where the faint blueberry notes come in), and a sweetened bakers chocolate. The cocoa sticks with your palate with each sip, but otherwise it finishes quickly. Not bad, not exceptional.

M: This beer feels brilliant in the ol mouth, it just coats the tongue and roof of the mouth and flows down the throat so well. Wow, that sounds rather, errr, beerographic. A perfect blend of texture and carbonation.

D: Given that this beer is NOT very fruity or sweet, I think itd be pretty easy to drink several in a night. A fantastic after-dinner drink, or for sitting around with friends. Not sure of the ABV since its not listed, but the drinkability is solid.

The blueberry aroma is fanstastic, it is subtle, but upon opening the top I could smell it and it smells fantastic.  I can almost taste the berries in my mouth.

Nose is a touch of wild blueberry over coffee and brown bread. The whole is quite well-intergrated, and nothing is over-the-top.

Medium in the mouth with the bready malt leading over dark chocolate and a touch of coffee. Initially, the blueberry comes across more as a fruity element of the chocolate component, but comes more to the fore (sorry, bad Dark Horse pun) at the finish. Its never obtrusive, and its a quality blueberry flavor - not the nasty taste of supermarket blueberries.

Nice crisp body cuts through the richness of the malt and keeps the beer on its toes. Very nice bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. The restraint of the fruitiness, and the level of integration make this an easy one to down. Great job!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","RealAleDave"

485,"2006-10-22",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2007 Bottle. This beer pours super opaque black with a dark brown head and a wall of lacing. I have to admit, the prospect of a stout brewed with blueberries does not sound very good. But the aroma is marvelous. Rich chocolate and earthen notes interwine harmoniously with a subtle hint of blueberries. Now for the true test: the flavor. Wow. Its rich of drying espresso complete with a smoky finish. Then, a velvety undertone of blueberries mixes with rich chocolate to really smooth everything out.  The description of a ""surprisingly light palate"" is way off base.  This is one of the sturdiest 4.5% stouts Ive had. Maybe they were referencing specifically the blueberry flavor. A few more sips brings the blueberries up front just a bit more, but what really lingers is the smoky finish of espresso and bark. I am especially blown away given my low expectations for this brew and my general aversion to fruit beers in general.  Cheers!

[an update from my Dark Lord excursion] Had a little taste of this on tap at Rich Os this time. I was shocked at the large blueberry presence both in the aroma and the taste. This is not at all what I remember nor is it what my notes indicate. I know my first bottle was a few months old at the very least and perhaps that aging allowed the blueberry character to mellow out and the malts to come together. Im not going to change my rating until I get another taste, but I was a  little let down when I had it the second time. Still it was all right.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Thanks to artusory for the beer in a recent trade.  Ive had a handful of Dark Horse beers.  This is the best so far, beating out the 3 Guys Off the Scale.  The blueberry is not overpowering but it is obvious enough where this beer gets its name.
Aroma / Appearance - The nose was an interesting combination of blueberry pie, chocolate, mocha and smoke.  It reminds me of a warm blueberry cobbler.  The pour was deep black and fluid with just a hint of head.  The lacing was muddy brown as it slid down the side of my sample glass.
Flavor / Palate - A bitter combination of blueberries, cherries, smoke and roasted malts comprise the taste.  It does not change much over the course of the beer but is very consistant.  It feels as if someone liquified blueberry cobbler in a smoky environment.  It was very enjoyable, though not quite on par with New Glarus Belgian Red.  Still, if this ever makes it to Madison I could easily see picking up some more.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours at cellar temperature into my Chouffe tulip with a very thick, stable dark brown head atop a jet body.....the fresh blueberry-dominant nose is apparent a few feet away, instantly upon opening, and the bare hints of milk chocolate merely add delight.....in the body, the berries and dark roastiness of the stout dont mix quite so well, a bitter-lactic-fruity-acidic combustion ensues and Im not quite sure what element is the victor, though it is quite interesting to watch (and taste).  In the end, much more bitter and roasty than a ""fruit beer"" would typically be, but with a shallower profile than many stouts...somehow, it maintains enough character to be drinkable, even excellent, though I would conclude after this sample that blueberries are not the first fruit to think of melding into a stout.

Taste is almost campfire smoky, burnt, bitter (hops and tart fruits), with coffee-like acidity in the longish finish, which also seemed to have a fair bit of black pepper just as an added benefit.  The palate on this one is acidic, thick, creamy and even a little fizzy - I loved it, but calling this a fruit beer is insane - its a stout with some fruit added, that cant really even be tasted, just smelled.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Some singed black cherry traits as well.  Medium bodied and slickly expansive.  Mild vinous complexity hints as its ability to shine for some time.  Beautiful finish of artisan coffee grinds and chocolate blueberry muffins.  Big thanks to Styles for this one!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

I could have sworn this one was going to be 10% with how dark it was.  Relaly nice long lasting creamy brown head and good lacing.  Aroma is very very strong with fresh blueberries.  I can smell it from at least 2 feet away.  Upon further inspection the aroma also has some chocolate and a bit of roasted malts. Flavor has tons of chocolate malt, a bit of roasted barley and a ton of blueberries.  FInish is a bit tart but mostly smooth.  This beer is awesome.

Just enough blueberry flavor to know its there, along with chocolate and toasty malt goodness.   Mouth feel is smooth and creamy.

Thanks to some great Northern rater for sending me this brew last winter~!

 What an oddity! The body is absolutely opaque. Black as a crow in the cloudy night sky. The head is what I find odd. It is a dark khaki but with a ruby hue to it. There is a muddled glow of red that cannot be overlooked maybe from the skins of blueberry? The aroma is a dark chocolate blueberry truffle; that is all, my perfect descriptor. WOW! The flavor brings a richness of melted chocolate and the bitterness of cold coffee with a splash of cream, but all wrapped together with a bushel of overly ripened blueberry. The essence and exuberance of the berry nearly being too soft from age that kind of aromatics. Very intriguing! ( I sell SeaDog Blue Paw, a Blueberry Wheat Ale: yet this, although a stout, this beer is similar in that  the aromatics of the Blueberry are more so than the flavors.) The love the chary bitter finish. This reminds me of the Winter Holliday Seasion. Pie, candles, pastries, cobblers this is a liquid Candy / Coffee to me! Very nice! My only gripe is that the palate is rather light for a stout and that is a shame because a chewier beer would make an enormous difference! Nevertheless, A great find and a nice liquid experience!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Burnt, tangy flavors with moderate bitterness. Maybe some blueberry fruitiness in there, but thats probably more the power of suggestion than actual detection. Full-bodied and oily with lively carbonation. Burnt, mildly bitter, dry finish. Judging by the verbiage in others ratings, I stand alone in thinking this looks and feels more like an imperial stout than a low gravity dry stout. Cant believe the ABV is only 4.5%.

Fairly light in feel with a bit of airiness.  Fruitiness of blueberries shows itself throughout the guzzle. A light and fruit essence that does not truly reveal itself willingly, but its there - One of the reasons I have restrained myself from trying this in a homebrew.  The more I think about it perhaps a mix of 90% blueberries and 10% raspberries would bring out the flavors more. I digress. This really does seem to fit the bill.

All the black patent in this beer makes it somewhat bitter (a trademark from the brewery).  This beer tastes and looks very similar to the too and fore (a common bond between their beers).  more carbonation than the last sample of too i had, but this is the perfect level of carbonation here.

And its a step well-approved, a genuinely tasty stout is sampled, something rich, dark, full-bodied, yet still capturing a subtle fruity quality that emits subtle rewards. Honestly, a blueberry stout? Well, Ive had cherry stouts, and heard of banana stouts, what the hey, eh? There it is, that subtle, delightful, fruity flavor riding just on top of the darker character of the stout.

Nice aroma here, tantalizing black licorice, dark chocolate, blackened burnt raisins, roasted coffee, black pepper, and some anise and corriander notes. Im not getting alot of blueberry, but whats there is very earthy, dark and fresh, like they threw in the whole blueberry bush, twigs, leaves, and all. Nothing fake, or so I hope. It reminds me of a subdued Bells Expedition mixed with the Harry Magills. And thats a good thing.

Taste is nice, smooth lusious front thats relatively creamy and mild with roasty tones, dark and bittersweet chocolate sweeps in dotted with spices, touches of the blueberry, then goes into a complexing little finish of drying where oaty sweetness, chocolatey dryness, nudges of coffee, and black malt roast; and way late is a return of blueberry in a very intricate earthy juicyness covered in some of the roasty drying qualities. Quite an interesting and complex brew.

Feel is close to full throughout, smooth and creamy front, soothing, warming in its spices, cooling with its oaty sweetness and blueberry fruityness. Finish is where its at, finespun and layered in dryness with great combinations of roasty stuff, sweet oats and chocolate.

The blueberry is there in the flavor, but not so strongly.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
485,"2004-04-04",3.1,"On tap at the brewery. Poured a small sized tan head that contained fine sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The hue was black with an opaque body. The aroma was lightly hoppy and blueberry. The taste was sweet, malty and coffee and raspberry. The mouthfeel was smooth and this was a medium bodied beer with sparse lacing.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
485,"2004-04-04",3.6,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a medium sized head pf dark brown colored finely sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lacing.  The body was opaque and dark black colored with no carbonation visible due to the opaqueness.  The aroma was mildly malted with blueberry notes.  The mouth feel was initially smooth with a lingering blueberry licorice finish.  The flavor was of blueberries and dark malts.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
485,"2004-03-11",3.2,"As has been said, pitch black. Opaque, hugely bottle conditioned, AND a large deep rich yellow-tan head.  Smells of blueberry rinds, not sweet at all, more like vegetables, or spices.  Immediately, flavor reminds me of ginger. . .what is going on?? Is this just extremely dry blueberry extract?? How is this stuff this dry?  Tastes very similar to 2004 Anchor OSA, though less spicey and a bit thinner.  Coffee rinds at the start, and a hazlenut finish with some light blueberry.  Mouthfeel is just plain light, some stickiness on the finish, from the barley, but nowhere near what a stout should be.  If they are going to call this a stout, make it a stout, not a dark colored blueberry ale.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
485,"2004-02-01",3.7,"Black, pitch black - great looking light brown head - what a stout should look like.  Light blueberry at the front of the nose, roasty with hints of coffee.  Fruity and fresh smelling.  The body is nicely fruity with delectable coffee notes.  Very little blueberry in this thing, roasty with a light palate.  A very nice base stout - doesn't really need the blueberry, it's barely detectable anyway.  Not up to the standard set by other fruit stouts like Bell's Cherry Stout, but a good stout nonetheless.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
485,"2003-12-10",2.3,"The beer poured smoothly and produced a fast fading head with minimal lace. The beer is jet black with a dark brown head. The nose is minty and the aroma is like green cardamom, not what I was expecting. The palate is also full of cardamom flavors. The beer underneath is very roasty, with predominate flavors of black coffee. This is a strange brew; the blueberry is nowhere to be found.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
485,"2003-12-07",3.8,"Pours a rich oily black with a thin light brown head.  Upon opening the bottle I can smell the blueberries.  Nose is a complex mixture of sweet blueberry and roasted chocolate malt.  The blueberry flavor is very subtle in the body, contributing a light tartness up front and slowly fading, covered by the roasted malt flavor.  Finishes dry and roasty with some lingering dark chocolate.  A novel idea and done pretty well, but as Slikwily said, it could use a little more blueberry flavor.  Nonetheless, very drinkable and enjoyable.  Thanks bbb63!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
485,"2003-11-16",3.3,"First whiff off the bottle is pure blueberry,pours a nice coal black color with a small light black head.Malty sweet aroma with a slight coffee and dark chocolate tone with the blueberry coming on strong.The flavor is a bit disappointing,High on the coffee and dark chocolate,malt as well,but the Blueberry kind of struggles to make it self known.The after taste is coffee and chocolate with a nice bitterness to it.This is a good brew for trying but i guess for my taste i would have liked a bit more blueberry.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
485,"2003-11-14",3.1,"I appear to be in disagreement with the consensus on this stout.  I found the combination of blueberries and stout flavors awkward and ultimately unsatisfying.  Poured in typical Dark Horse fashion: thick like molasses, with a brown head (yes, a brown head; this is how dark their stouts are!).  Aroma had some roasted notes but reminded me otherwise of Smuckers Blueberry Syrup.  Some licorice in the body with roasted notes and a hint of smokiness, enveloped in tart blueberry notes.  The aroma suggested blueberries would dominate the flavor, but I found otherwise.  Still, the blueberry notes muted the typical roastiness, creating a beer that was thick but not bursting with flavor by any means.  Also some roasted vegetable ""off"" flavors.  I'll stick with the delectable ""Too"" Cream Stout.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
485,"2003-11-13",3.9,"Absolutely beautiful as far as a stout is concerned. You cannot see light through this beer like most stouts. The head is a foamy bubbly tan, very deep tan and very nice to look at. Smells of malt, bitter chocolate, and the faintest hint of blueberries. Tastes quite nice actually, a roasted nut sort of flavor in the finish but a stout flavor at first. The blueberry flavor really is an accent. There is an annoying metallic flavor that interferes overall but the beer is quite nice. Coffee and chocolate.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","thehoff"
485,"2003-09-18",3.7,"Poured a deep dark brown with a large brown head. aroma was of roasted malt and blueberries. Taste was roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and subtle hints of blueberry. mouthfeel is light and slightly creamy. The combination of stout and blueberries easily could have been a disaster, but this beer pulls it off fairly well.","Kentwood, Michigan, USA","bubslang"
485,"2003-08-11",3.5,"Dark brown color with a large milk chocolate uneven creamy head.  Crisp rain fresh aroma with more of the blueberry skin aroma.  Blueberries are noticable in the taste, slighltly tart, carbonated.  I could not detect much if any traditional stout characteristics: coffee, chocolate.  This beer became tiresome after 3/4 of the glass.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
485,"2003-07-02",4.1,"Chunky, eruptive bronze foam.  Impenetrable black liquid.  Lively, fresh, earthy aroma of freshly mashed blueberries, herbs,  ginger, perfume, and wood.  Hints of leaf, port, and black malts.  Blueberries add a floral touch.  Airy and phenolic.  A thin mouthfeel lies beneath the fluffy carbonation and tries to turn creamy.  Initial note of acidity with charcoal, leather, grass, and meaty molasses flavors.  Touch of vanilla, prunes, and bakers chocolate.  Burnt malt overload.  Lovely finishing notes of toffee, coconut, and espresso.  This sample was slightly metallic and oxidized, but the fresh blueberry notes and rich, Imperialesque burnt malt flavors were exquisite.  Cheers, Prof!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
485,"2003-05-24",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2004 Rerate: This last batch seems to have a stronger burnt malt, coffee, and acidic taste that before and is slightly less balanced. Again, the blueberry flavors need to be more present in the taste. I still like it and only a drop of .2 overall.--Orignal review--

Wow, DON'T be afraid of this dark. Opaque black with a huge tan head and medium-bodied. Blueberries on to the forefront but the stout characteristics are detectable (roasted malt, chocolate, coffee). The flavor however is much less aggressive. The blueberry is in the background here as the stout flavors dominate. The taste lasts on the palate. Since I like stouts and fruit beers, I found this an great combination.  I agree with last post, Marc, that this is closer to a stout than fruit beer.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
485,"2003-01-24",3.9,"Cool blueberry, vanilla, a little chocolate, and boo berry cereal.  Black as coal and a burnt sieana head.  Light mouth feel and more carbonation than extected, fortuanatly the carbonation died down at mid glass giveing way to a pleasant slightly dry bitter charactor.  Coffee, chocolate, blueberry, and ambient fruitieness came together in an amazingly effective way. Finishes chewy and roasty with a wallop of chocolate, coffee, molases and only the faintest traces of blueberry.  I'd concider this more of a stout than a fruit beer.  I've got a friend in psychprof, and he's got a friend in me.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
485,"2003-01-19",3.3,"Again, stouts aren""t a style I would normally enjoy.  This one poured dark and syrupy, with a definate smell of the blueberries.  First sip brought a suprisingly good taste, the swallow down provided an aftertaste of raw unsweetened blueberries.  Has no problem finishing this stout and would like to thank again psychprof for trading with me.","Sharon, Wisconsin, USA","awaller05"
485,"2003-01-15",4.0,"As all good stouts the beer is black as night.  Very carbonated, had a hard time pouring the beer without creating a volcano of head.  The blueberry gives a very strong aroma.  It seems that the blueberry is more powerful in the scent than the taste.  Good roasty flavor that really doesn""t give a lot of blueberry until the end.  I think a slightly sweeter stout would do very well with the blueberry flavor as well.","Redford, Michigan, USA","HoppyKev"
485,"2003-01-11",4.2,"Based on the previous ratings it looks like psychprof has been sending this one around the country. Im glad he let me in on the fun. The smell of freshly baked muffins permeated the room upon opening the bottle. While the beer certainly had a nice blueberry flavor, I was glad that it didnt dominate the beer. It had a nice roasty, rich flavor with the blueberry striking at the finish. Very enjoyable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Superstar"

That feeling has come to an end.  Psych Prof, a prophet really, has provided me with this blueberry elixir that frankly boggles my scrotum.  Unlike many other reviewers, I encounter almost no head.  There is little carbonation to get in the way of this complex, nearly imperial, stout.  Completely amazing.  Imagine Storm King and blueberries.  Sound weird?  It is.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"

485,"2002-08-18",4.3,"Im glad that I took a chance on a brewery a couple hours from my house that I had never heard of.  The head is impressive.  I HATE head on beers, Ive never understood them or tasted one that made me smile.  This one was out of control... about 1 inch of beer and six inches of head shot up immediately and then immediately receded.  Ive never liked flavored stouts either, but if youd have mixed a decent stout with Boo Berry cereal, you would end up with this.  The stout part of it is fine, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  The blend between the two of them is near flawless.  Try this if you like flavored stouts or just remember sitting around in your underoos spilling booberry cereal on yourself as you tried to watch Saturday morning cartoons before you went out to play guns with your friends before kids ever thought about using guns at school because their parents loved them and spent time with them because both didnt have to work 10 hour shifts to get by in the world and own a nicer house and car to kep up with the Jones.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","Jfishback13"

Tragically, the taste isnt as original, lacking almost entirely in blueberry flavor (OK, maybe theres some there, but its very subtle - see Weyerbachers Raspberry Stout if you really want a fruit-flavored stout).

485,"2002-06-07",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2003 This is much more of a stout than a fruit beer. The fruit aromas and flavors meld well with the natural esters of the malt and are complemented well by the heavy roastiness. There are big hops in here as well and the bitterness of the roast dovetails nicely with the extending herbal bitterness. I appreciate the full stout flavor -- roasty, chewy and full bodied -- while the fruit and bitter extend the beer beyond the call of duty. Thanks PsychProf!","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"

485,"2002-05-22",3.3,"The two Dark Horse brews I had last night were huge in flavour.  I mean, absolutely gigantic, heading-full-steam-towards-the-iceberg big.  Theres enough grace in the Wit to avoid crashing, but Im not so pleased with this one.  Maybe I just dont like fruit in my stouts, as I learned with Bells Cherry.  As with that beer, the fruit is well done - not cloying or plastic, but a definite, firm,  presence.  But again I find myself thinking - why do this to a decent roasty stout?  Its a good beer and Ill undertstand if future raves rocket it into cult status on RateBeer - I even admire the spirit of innovation that created it -  but its not my cup of, um, beer.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
485,"2002-05-06",3.5,"Extremely thick, chewy maltiness.  Lots of dark roasted malts, maybe a little too much.  Blueberry quality is extremely restrained, it is much more prevalent in the aroma than in the flavor.  Slight extract flavor, perhaps theyre using blueberry syrup?

Thin head stays a long time, and then you are looking at a smooth, strong, hefty mirrored black surface. Perfect melding of flavors...more blueberry and it would get horrifying, more stoutish and it would barely be a fruit beer. Upping this one .2. Rerate: Not for the faint of heart or blueberry haters. Everything is over the top here, blueberry aroma and taste, dark dark dark roasted malt. And I mean dark. The head is dark brown, yet the body is lighter, alive. Still the same 3.7 rating, but I had to let it be known that this thing is challenging.
Original: 4/24/02: This one works for me...far lighter in the mouth than I expected. Nice aroma, not over the top. Taste components are a slight roastiness, and, of course, blueberry.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
