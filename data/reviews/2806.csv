2806,"2010-07-07",4.1,"Draft at R-ford.  Pours hazy gold with white head.  Nose is lemongrassy hops, some pils malt, Saaz hops.  Tastes like the Pikeland, but with mose smoothness and a bit more complexity, with the Saaz hops, lemongrass, and pale malt balancing very well.  Another winner.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

Re-rate from a can.  Pours a translucent golden yellow with an average fluffy white head that laced.  Aroma of bread, citrus and various grains.  Flavor stays up to what I had in my earlier review. Crisp, dry and lighted hopped as the brewery said. Will be nice to have these around during the summer months and these cans should hold up until then.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
2806,"2005-11-03",3.9,"Poured straw yellow with a smallwhite head.  Aroma and flavor was all grassy, piney hops.  I dont know what it is about SE PA, but there sure are some good pilsners in this area.","New Providence, Pennsylvania, USA","axilla"

2806,"2005-10-17",4.5,"Unfiltered version, fresh from a growler that was not even an hour old.  Drank it on 10/7/2005.  Pours a lovely, hazy, brass to light copper with white-gold hues and a full, creamy, lasting white head.  Plenty of lacing as well.  Knockout appearance.  Aroma smells of intensely fragrant grassy, spicy and zesty herbal hops.  Dill, lemongrass, basil sort of thing, deep and satisfying, with a solid, creamy-honeyish malt backing that adds the necessary balance but really lets the hops shine.  Fresh, fragrant, touch sour yeast rounds out the aroma.  Flavor starts with a big dose of fresh grassy, very flavorful hops, continues on with a crisp and lightly biting yeast and finishes smooth, creamy and with a tight mouthfeel.  Honeyish pils malt is perfectly wedded with the hops.  Hints of very dry yellow fruits/fruit skins and a dry note of baked baguette and hay intermingle.  Hops flavor lingers on with a nice, yet well-controlled bitterness.  A real pleasure to have this stuff.  This would be my session beer of choice, hands down, if I lived near Sly Fox.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2806,"2005-10-13",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2007 The Lure:Creamy hay blades caress the citrusy hops with care. Evidently unfiltered, and a well-integrated yeast it is. Some later hopping would make it even more attractive, and in retrospect, I think it deserves it.

The Festivities:A levitating pils malt body dancing agreeably with citrusy, starfruit hoppiness. Lactic drops dispersed on a haystack. A lingering, luxurious bitterness continues the fresh hops work, as frothy carbonation lightens the palate.

Transcendence:Surrounded by horizons, you take a filling, deep breath.3.7/5

A tap version at Holy Smoke BBQ in Mahopac, NY was quite watery and thin, a shadow of what the can can be. I wonder if the beer was getting tired or this was just an underpar batch. 3/5.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2806,"2005-10-05",4.2,"Unfiltered Sly Fox Keller Pils version  Clear bright golden hue is quickly the foundation to a siperb foamy white head that lasts forever. Fair toasted and bready malts serve as a base to the wondrous floral hops that characterize this beer. Leafy, lemony, herbal: vibrant hoppiness that emerge from the glass and brings you straight to Germany through a very dry portal. Citric in mouth, but in the course of a mineral and very crisp interplay, which makes it all work nicely.. Ahhh those flowery saaz. Light-medium bodied, extremely engaging carbonation. Remarkable pilsner!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2806,"2005-10-04",2.8,"Pour is light golden yellow with thin off white head...smell is grassy and light...taset is hugely bitter...grassy bitterness...seemed sort of off style...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
2806,"2004-07-22",3.4,"Bright gold.  Quite hoppy, good pils, has nice malts upfront followed by decent hops.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
2806,"2004-07-19",4.1,"This was a winner.  It was Totally Saazy, baby.  Aroma is killer Saaz, lemon zest, faint white pepper, and light-as-a-cloud-golden cookie malts.  Pale gold and cloudy.  Perfect snapping white head.  Perfectly balanced--floral, then bitter, then sweetish into the slightly spicy aftertaste.  This is to the minuteae (sp.?) as excellent as the quarter keg of Mayer Brau keller bier that we kicked at Ds moms birthday party.  Lord, that stuff was good (I wasnt rating then).  And so is this.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
2806,"2004-07-19",4.6,"Draft: Hazy pale straw. Sticky, fluffy, dense white head. Beautifully pungent hop aroma laced with minerals, herbs, dough, lemon rind, and sugared hops. Soft body with tight, expansive carbonation. Starts with understatedly coarse hop flavors. Fairly flowery and delicate just before the herbal hops take effect. Zesty bitterness steadily builds throughout. Well-placed hints of acidity, midway, is a juicy counterpoint to the soft pilsner malt base. Overabundance of fresh hopsack flavors and bitter lemon zest in the finish as lightly toasted malts return to provide balance and depth. This gets my vote for best Pils in the states.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2806,"2004-07-18",4.0,"Royal Stumble. Excellent pilsener. Nice, light dough aroma and medium bodied taste. Nice head retention and flavor.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2806,"2004-07-05",3.2,"Slightly hazy straw body with white head.  Aroma is medium sweet, grassy.  Taste is medium sweet, grassy, some herbal, lemon.  Pretty solid bitterness.  Light-medium body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2806,"2004-06-21",3.4,"I was working Saturday morning at the Grey Lodge Pub when egajdzis   stopped by with a growler of Keller Pils.   Not many people bring me beer when I bartend, especially one I have not rated.   I never drink while bartending, but a few glasses of Sly Fox hit the spot.   Dont let the cloudy body of this beer fool you, its a smooth session beer.    Hops and malts are blended well in  this lightly carbonated beer.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
2806,"2003-04-01",4.6,"Ok - I might get spanked for adding the Keller as a different beer - it's the unfiltered cellared version of their Pikeland Pils.  But, this beer is SO much better - it needs it's own listing.

After recently attending a Michael Jackson beer dinner in Philly, that was followed by an open tasting of about 100 different beers, I kept finding myself going back for another one of these Pilseners.  Except for the deatly 120minute IPA from Dogfish Head, I think this was my favorite beer at the open tasting.

Rich european hop aroma and flavor.  Cloudy yellow in color with a thin white head.  This is downright one of the best Pilsener's I've had, and maybe in my top 10 beers overall.  

While I'm not much of a fan of other things Sly Fox does, this Keller Pils is awesome.","Oreland, Pennsylvania, USA","chronictonic"
