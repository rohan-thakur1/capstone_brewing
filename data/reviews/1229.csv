1229,"2013-10-07",3.2,"Corked bottlePours a dark mahogany color, clean, with medium sized head. Aroma of malt and oak barrel, cane sugar, hint of oxidisation. Full bodied; rather sweet caramel flavor with sweet nuts traces; unfortunately the alcohol is too present, and it seems to be the sole counterpart of the sweetness, rather than some more solid bitterness. Some vegetable soup in the end.Easily cloying.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

Taste is caramel. butterscotch, peach, muscovado sugar, raisins, figs, dates, ripe apples. Just very well balanced and an amazing beer!","Stockholm, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","ansalon"
1229,"2013-09-20",3.7,"Bottle 50 cl from Systembolaget. Clear ruby with a quickly dissipating beige head. Milk chocolate, fudge, vanilla, caramel, icecream?, really quite sweet. Medium/full body, low carbonation, quite warming, a bit sticky, sweet finish. Really nice.","SWEDEN","circinus"
1229,"2013-09-19",4.3,"Lots of fudge aroma with hints of milk chocolate and dark syrup. Some vanilla and vineous notes are present as well but at very low levels. Dark red, clear with frothy foam. Really sweet vanilla fudgy taste with some roastiness in the background. Very nice and round taste with some alcohol present but not at disturbing levels. The finsish is long lasting with some vineous notes combined with some sweetness and vanilla. The longer the finish goes on the more to the vanilla with hints of fudge it goes. The body is medium to full and the texture is creamy. A relly nice beer although pretty mighty. According to style description (from SHBF) it is to my judgement a very good example of a doppelbock and one that has sparked an interest in the style for me.","SWEDEN","Franzen"
1229,"2013-09-14",4.2,"Helt klar och röd-orange med ett orange-brunt skum. Doft: Madeira, trä, vanilj, rom russin glass, rödavinbär, hemmagjord knäck, sött doft som alp smör, vanilj. Smak: Som doft, bara att byta ut rödavinbär mot röda bär. Tänker Barley Wine när jag dricker, mmm.","örebro, SWEDEN","beer_est_deus"
1229,"2013-09-13",3.7,"Bottle. Clear deep copper liquid with small off-white head. Aroma of raw sugar, dried fruit, caramel, oak, coconut, toffee, bread and biscuit. Taste is light sweet and light bitter with notes of dried fruit, toffee and oak. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Quite nice.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"
1229,"2013-09-11",3.2,"@basunen: småtrevlig doft med tydliga fattoner. Smaken är smått söt av brunsocker och kola. Annars tycker jag faktisk den är ganska tunn och intetsägande.

1229,"2013-09-08",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2013 500 ml bottle, pours a slightly cloudy dark red with a small beige head that completely dissipated fast. Aroma of apricots, raisins, butterscotch and oak. Taste of apricots, raisins, butterscotch, muscovado sugar and some alcohol. A strong and sweet bourbon like character, full body with low carbonation. Undeniably well crafted, but the alcohol is noticeable and the beer is a little too strong for my taste.","Vallentuna, SWEDEN","SamTheBarrel"
1229,"2013-09-06",4.2,"So, an ""anniversary ale"" that is actually a lager, well whatever! Looks extremely sophisticated with a deep, clear red color resting peacefully underneath a huge beige fine-bubbly head. Aroma is spot on with chewy cookie and vanilla notes combined with musty rum soaked raisins, clean fine liquor and leather, mature red apples and dark artisan chocolate. Flavor is seriously intense and sweet, though lifted by a very fine and precise amount of scrubbing carbonation which carries the somewhat thin body and lets the subtile fruit character pop. The finish is warming, fruity and mature, though perhaps a tad too short as Im already there for another sip. A pure joy to drink however an way above my expectations.","Malmö, SWEDEN","andersand"
1229,"2013-08-22",3.8,"650ml Bottle - Copper in colour. Malt, leather, raisins and caramel in the aroma. Malty and fruity taste with caramel, raisins, plums and fudge detected.","Uppsala, SWEDEN","SaintMatty"
