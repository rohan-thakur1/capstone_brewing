Strong barrel presence in the nose which is dominated by bourbon and a strong oak presence. Slight toothpick oaky character with a little bit of coconut, marshmallow and vanilla along with spicy and sweet bourbon notes. As it warms, Im picking up sweet and roasted malt as well as a bit of dark fruit. Hints of chocolate cake, fig, dark cherry and other vinous berries. 

Fuller end of medium bodied with soft carbonation. Really nice mouthfeel for the style. Thick but not viscous with surprising crisp carbonation that really helps. Again, the barrel presnce is really prominent with lots of bourbon flavor but its not hot or overly boozy. Sweet bourbon with some spicy rye along with dry, toasted oak, vanilla bean and some toasted coconut. After the beer warms, Im picking up more dark malt, spice and vinous fruit sweetness. A little peppery spice and rye compliment the spirit flavors. Theres also some cherry and other dark berries along with some silky chooclate sweetness and subtle roast. Still, this beer is a bit bourbon heavy but the lack of heat makes it pretty easy to drink.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

A: Dark mahogany to the point of blackness. Lathery mocha head that disappears. Good legs.

N: Big bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. Toffee. Some melon. Brown sugar.

T: Bourbon integrated into a softly sweet base. Hop bitterness around the edges. Alcohol is noticeable.

M: Crystallized and sticky. Gets a little watery.

2667,"2013-12-18",4.0,"2013 vintage. 
Aroma has a nice dark chocolate character with some light roast. Medium light roast character with moderate bourbon and light oak notes. Medium dark fruit with prune, plum and raisin. Some toffee and caramel notes. 
Pours dark brown but not quite black with a small, thick mocha head that recedes fairly steadily to the edges where it lingers slightly. 
Flavor has a nice strong dark chocolate note with light roast and moderately strong bourbon character. Some dark fruit notes of plum and prune with some raisin character. Medium bitterness. Light caramel and moderate toffee. Some medium light alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a pretty enjoyable beer. The malt character is not as complex as it could be, but the bourbon character is super well integrated with malt and works really well. Nice bourbon character with some decent dark fruit notes.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Pours dark brown on black with a slight etching of light mocha foam. Smells fucking awesome, bourbon, vanilla, nougat, caramel, vitamins and minerals, some marshmallow cream and a little bit of burnt cream. Taste follows suite - vanilla, nougat, marshmallow, chocolate, bourbon, oak, smooth malts with a touch of alcohol. Really decadent. Full bodied with limited carb and a fantastically long and mouth watering finish. Im really, really impressed with this beer. Wow. Nice.

Very pricey, but worth a couple bottles every year because its so different. Loses barrel notes and some depth when aged, so not good for the cellar beyond 6 months or so.

Deep ruby brown pour with black highlights.

Head is two fingers of tan, dense foam that subsides to form a lasting ring. Lacing is minimal, but decent.

The nose (and flavor) are bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon with underpinnings of dark chocolate, toffee, caramel brown and red fruits almost too numerous to list (date, fig, kumquat, plum, breadfruit, starfruit, mandarin orange/tangerine, pineapple, just to name a few). There is also plenty of old leather, tobacco, coconut, pecan praline, honey, sherry, brandy a hint of smoke, cinnamon, cardamom, and coriander, and even a touch of something like lavender. 

This beer reminds me of a cross between Firestone Walkers Fifteen and Parabola, except its richer, and more intense in flavor than either of those, despite being three percent lower in alcohol! This beer may not be as subtle as some, but its one of the most complex, dynamic brews of any style that Ive tasted.

This is definitely the ultimate sipping beer, and would pair marvelously with the stoutest cigar.

Major Kudos to Fremont Brewing for creating that rarest of beers worthy of being called an instant classic.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"

The beer pours a deep red color with an off-white head. The aroma has a ton of bourbon and wood notes, as well as some oak, maple and caramel. The beer smells amazing and has all the notes you want in a bourbon barrel aged beer. 

The flavor is just as good as the aroma. I get a lot of chocolate and some light roasted malt notes, as well as some nice bourbon, maple and vanilla. There is also a nice oak undertone in the flavor.

Aroma is semi-hot bourbon with some vanilla, subtle coconut, toffee, cola, and perhaps some sweet, toasted malt buried under the bourbon.  Taste is dominated by the bourbon which presents as initially a bit hot before opening up with some nice vanilla and coconut.  The middle of the taste consists of the sweet, toasted malt and toffee character of the base beer with some light bitter hops and raisin accents before the bourbon reappears and runs through the finish with some light alcohol heat. Mouthfeel is even and coating.  I really enjoyed this beer.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"

This beer is really dominated by the bourbon.  boozy alcohol that almost burns when you breath after drinking it.  Some caramel sweetness and a little fruitiness, but it is all just so dominated by the bourbon.  I like it when the barrel aged beers are better balanced.  Still, if you like bourbon you will like this.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

2667,"2012-01-13",4.0,"22 oz. bottle from the PCC in Fremont. I got hooked up on this one. Could have bought it weeks ago, but I decided not to, considering, the hefty price-tag. Head around the circumference of the glass. Lots of vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Wow, this this is pungent, and its smellin pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. Bits of graham cracker poke through, as well. Lovely aroma, and color. All bourbon both forwards and backwards. This thing is fucking hot, but on a night like tonight, I need something this hot. Damn this is a mouth warmer. Very, very boozy. Its out of control boozy.Bits of the vanilla, come through but the hot bourbon just rolls in and doesnt leave much Very good stuff, and very much needed on a cold Seattle night, such as this. Texture is thin, and deep molasses and caramel richness are left at the back of your throat. This develop s some, but not much $17.50 for a bottle. Great stuff from Fremont. Fremont Brewing Co., this is what you should normally brew, but on a larger, and cheaper scale.

2667,"2010-01-21",4.1,"Barrel-Aged Abominable Winter Ale, by Fremont Brewing

but you expected it to be in a pint glass like days of old when the bartender knew hed get you drunk but didnt care anyhow. Hed twist his baseball cap a bit when he saw you stumble against the pool table. But he knew you were careful enough never to spill a drop as though you had the final serum for AIDS. Ah, that was a different city and at least a year ago.

Dont be fooled by the inconspicuous name (Freeeeeeemont) of the brewer, barrel-aging apparently is a cure-all for everything you throw in a mash and call Beer. Hope springs eternal. Or some bullshit of similar nature. Please throw out an AND 1 for this tasty concoction as it slashes its way through the paint of your palate, infuriating your defensive beerhavior power forwards. You thought you knew enough to guard against simple flavor enjoyment but this Winter takes it to the rack and drops a deuce on your tongue.

Find a corner of the floor (or barno bottles) and curl up with this one while you can because its fuck-all cold out there in the stinkin rain son.
