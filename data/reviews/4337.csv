4337,"2015-06-23",3.4,"4 or 5 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 6-20-15. Pours a very nice maroon with an amber hue. Beige head. Looks good. Plum, caramel, and raspberry scents. Fruity flavor matches the fruity aroma. Malty taste. Medium to full body. Lively in the palate. Not my preferred style of beer but good for what it is.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
4337,"2015-06-19",3.6,"Dark red brown with a small head. Berry and pepper nose. Sweet malty flavor. Really opens up and shows its depth after 20 minutes or so.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
4337,"2015-06-11",3.8,"Tulip at the brewery - dark ruby - listed at 8.1% - rich, malty English strong, with equal parts sweet, toffee-ish maltiness, and drier, whiskey-ish maltiness - notes of smoke, raisin, hazelnut, peat, dark bread - warming but not hot finish - tasty.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4337,"2015-05-30",3.6,"Keg @ Town Hall. Deep Amber, small head. Nose of raisin bread and fruit skin. Caramelized banana. Roasty, dry, boozy flavor profile. Toasted brown bread. Plum spread. Some toffee sweetness. Full body, sort of oily.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4337,"2015-05-22",3.7,"Tap at Town Hall. Amber pour with a small dense head. Sweet malts, toffee, raisin, sweet brown sugar. Some bread. Palate is lighter to medium, clean. Very tasty.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"

4337,"2015-05-17",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear deep amber with a very thin tan head that dissipates completely. Aroma has lots of bread and grain notes with a touch of underlying toffee. Flavor has sweet grains and toffee with a bit of caramel and a hint of bread.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
4337,"2010-12-03",3.5,"Growler, courtesy dchmela. Pours a mostly clear, dark reddish amber color and topped by a small, smooth head of beige colored foam that settles to a thin film and leaving random spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is based in sweet caramel, brown sugar, and bready malts to go along with some dark fruits, spices, and some vanilla to smooth things out. The flavor follows suit with the bready malts, dark fruits, caramel, and some balancing earthen hop bitterness. The alcohol comes through a bit on the finish as well. Medium bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation and a sweet finish with some alcohol warmth. Fairly straight forward, but solid brew either way.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
4337,"2010-10-11",3.4,"Growler.  Clear and dark, sporting a reddish-amber hue, the body sports a small, smooth cap of beige foam.  Moderate lacing is primarily spotty in nature.  Aromas start out with caramelized brown sugars and sweet bread crust malts, hinting also at stewed raisins and a little winter spice.  Vanilla makes an appearance, and some mild, earthen hops do well to keep things somewhat in balance.  Flavors largely follow suit, again very bready and malty, laden with caramelized sugars, dark bread, and some sugary dark fruits, all with a earthy hop counterpoint and some noticeable alcohol.  Substantial in body and smooth, with moderate carbonation, the palate shows some boozy warmth and a sweet finish, but doesnt get to be overly hot or cloying.  Overall, its a solid brew.  Maybe a little mundane, but well made nonetheless.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
4337,"2010-06-03",3.7,"Growler pour. Deep red pour with a thick off white head. Huge caramel, toffee and citrus hop aroma. Lots of toffee notes, great body with nice citrus hop bitterness poking through. Good stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
4337,"2010-04-24",4.2,"Growler.  Clear amber pour, good amount of carbonation and mild malty and subtle hop aroma.  Flavor rings true to the desctription above, nice toffee and brown sugar, heavy malt and finished with dry plum and a tiny bit of heat.  Really liked this one and might need to make another trip into the city for another growler.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
4337,"2010-04-17",3.7,"Pours deep opaque red on cask, huge white head.  Aroma is nice and creamy caramel, chocolate and some english hops.  Some tiny bits of hops at the beginning leads into caramel, chocolate, and some earthy malt finishes sweet and thick.  Nice brew!","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4337,"2007-11-20",4.3,"I had this on tap a while back at Town Hall.  This may be the best beer I have had there.  Ruby dark red in color with not much head.  Aroma of light dark fruit and a bit of maple syrup.  Sweet malt in taste without much alcohol.  This beer was great.","Coralville, Iowa, USA","KAF"
4337,"2007-10-24",3.9,"On-tap at the brewpub: Deep dark pale brown color and very muted glow with a tint of cherry red to it. Thin, dense capping of lightly stained tan foam sits briefly before slipping to a thin collar and a few stirngs of thin lacing.

Nice aroma of dark toffee and caramel sweetness mixing with really deep fruity ascents of cherry, raisin, and fig breads. Some maple and vanilla notes keep it secured in deepness as it settles.

Flavors are malty and sweet with a bit of caramel wrapped in moist dark fruity stuff. Bready, mellowing, yet partially lush, semi rich, and low ended with some figgyness, maple, brown sugar, and earthy touches as it finishes. Overall, just a melange of good Ole malty sweetness and a pale dull finish.

Feel is a bit feathery, yet kinda slick and trying to go creamy. Has about a medium body with a slow mellowing tone of sweetness and a finish that really just pales off and doesnt develope as much as it should.

Perhaps this batch is not quite the same, or has changed in some manner as when first released as I was not all that taken with it and went right back to the Mama after this one.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
4337,"2007-07-30",3.5,"Dark Red Color with Sandy Ring. Syrupy Malt, Strong English Hopped Aroma.  Syrupy, almost Silky Mouthfeel. Medium to Heavy Bodied Brew...Sweet Barley, Heavily Laden with English Hops..Vinous. Hops Have a Musty Quality to Them in the Aftertaste. Unless Someone Was Told Otherwise, Hamlets was Printed as Being 9%.  As Such, Pretty Darn Smooth and Still Served in a Pint Glass. Overall, Although its Clear There are West Coast Hop Heads Working in Town Hall, This Was an Enjoyable Beer.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
4337,"2007-07-16",3.7,"Aroma of figs and cinnamon. Taste is dark, juicy malt- hops come in at just the right moment. Reminds me of arrogant bastard.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
4337,"2007-07-15",3.4,"Oaky red appearance lacking any head.  Aroma reveals only a muted pulse of lemon water at first.  Eventually, wild rice and honey with a maple wood density.  Earthy.  Flutters of raspberries and strawberries in the cracks of a dirty peat malt body.  Alcohol is present in moments of nail polish or fruit liqueur sting, alongside a vague, persistent oak barrel suggestion.  Full-bodied and somewhat intensely rendered palate.  Worth it.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4337,"2007-07-14",3.6,"Tap at the brewpub. Pours rich brown with a tiny white head. Sweet malt on the nose. Sweet flavor with some raisin and orange peel notes. Decent balance between hops and malt. Nice oily texture.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
4337,"2007-07-12",3.2,"Dark red, nearly brown with a bit of an off-white head on top. Uninspiring aroma of some sweet malts.  The flavor is very sweet with some caramel and brown sugar. Well hidden alcohol, a bit of hops in the finish. Not bad overall but it just wasnt something Id normally pick.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
4337,"2007-07-11",4.1,"Forgot to copy the brewers info this time...oopsy-daisy! And Andy said theyd done this one before, but under a different name...I dont think so, cant find anything like it anywhere. In any case, it appeared out of the blue, with no fanfare when I visited Tuesday night, and now lets drink some!

Deep magenta hue, slimmish head....

Sweetness in the nose, sweet, firm, distictly malty...dark fruits and minor caramel and toffee...a maltier affair, with plenty of British hops.

Slick, good texture on the palate, toasty, caramel-y, then the mellow fruit, very sweet, but not too much so, well-balanced, indeed.

Full-bodied, with plenty of trick and tickle on the tongue...a sweet and sassy affair...reminds me of Theakstons Old Peculiar...not too strong, thick and malty, but terribly significant and dripping with flavor. Nearly candyish in the malty sweetness, I nearly think. King Caramel. 

So many good things going for it, its tough not to love. Doesnt fit the season, but Ive always got a hankering for a brew this good. 
I need to start a party, just to have an excuse to spread a beer this good around. Yum, yum, and once again, yum!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
4337,"2007-07-10",3.9,"Dark ruby color with a very thin head.  Weak aroma of alcohol and malt.  Big flavor!  Lots of molasses, brown sugar and fruit.  Slightly bitter.  Fruity finish with some chocolate.  Friggin good!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4337,"2007-07-09",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub.  Dark ruby color with a strong sweet nose.  The aroma had a raisin characteristic.  Sweet malt body with raisin undertones.  Almost a session barleywine.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
