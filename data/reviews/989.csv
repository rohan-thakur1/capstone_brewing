Taste malts, lightly smoke, some fruityness, dry berries, hops but somehow not in a really nice way. I dont know, its weird, its like the flavors just dont match. The smokyness, hops and berries just dont match imo. Not my kind of beer.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"

989,"2017-01-06",4.2,"Piana drobna i średnia, obfita. Barwa złota, opalizująca. Aromat brzoskwiniowo cytrusowy a z drugiej strony waniliowo biszkoptowy, z ziołową nutką w tle. W smaku półwytrawne, sporo białych owoców, winogron, białego wina, są i lekko kwaskowe cytrusy, i średnia żywiczna goryczka, nieco tanin i wanilii na finiszu. W odbiorze lekko szorstkie, lekko rozgrzewające, z drobnym, średnio intensywnym wysyceniem. Bardzo pijalne!

Fajne, bardziej wytrawne i bardziej w kierunku lekkiego białego wina niż słodsza i cięższa w odbiorze wersja podstawowa. Przypomina mi to piwa z Widawy: The Spirit of Sonoma IPA Sauvignon Blanc Barrel Aged IPA czy X BA Nitro IPA serwowane na BGM2.","Kalisz, POLAND","alteregoo"

Woody, with some coconut too, and nice white oak woodiness. Taste: Some white grapes, dry skins, but a little slickness too. Finish is very nice, woody, grape skins, tannins. Nice, but not grabbing me. (anna adds that adding the bottom yeast to this golden drink makes the mouth feel better but decreases the complexity in the finish and makes the beer a little sweeter.)","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

989,"2016-09-17",3.6,"500 ml bottle from Etre Gourmet, bb March 2018.
Orange-amber, cloudy body, with a big, creamy, lacing, yellowish head.
Aroma of dominant oak, yeast, flowers, some bread, some spices, some fruits.
Tastes of oak, yeast, citrus, grapes, vanilla, some spices, some sweet bread.
Medium, creamy mouthfeel, with an average carbonation.
Finishes wooden, medium dry, yeasty, a bit spicy, with some fruits, subtle piney hops.

The oak notes are quite dominant, with the yeast (Brett?) notes not far behind, all other notes quite in the background. A bit simple maybe, not as complex as expected and also a bit unbalanced, less oak notes would be better in my opinion. Overall not a bad beer, while I was expecting a bit more.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
989,"2016-08-10",3.9,"0.5 bottle.   A very hazy, amber color with a large, off-white head. A pleasant aroma of flowers, wood, leaves, hops, and delicate Brett. Taste is also floral with a significant oak backbone - subtle fruits and some bitterness complement the mix. A medium to full body, a creamy texture, and a soft carbonation. Finish is medium long, fruitier, also sourer but does not lose its woody character. Overall the beer is very good, well-crafted, and simply pleasant. There is an interesting, moderated, Brett-like flavor throughout the entire experience - worth a try.","Århus, DENMARK","KoNrRiI"

989,"2016-05-02",4.1,"Tasting glass from 500 (?) ml. bottle @ MEUG 2016. Clear orange, big creamy white head. Nose is big mix of kiwi, grass, hop, whole carries some lightly sourish oak, almost ceder, faintly sour white grapes, sour hops, interesting but fun. Taste is big hops, kiwi, litchi, white grape but alos lemon, tad muted though, same faintly sour oak, big juicy hops, tad empty, combination clashes a bit. Body is juicy hops. Very interesting, a bit messy & tad muted, shares some similarities with La Renaissance about ½ years old for me and as such I feel like this would benefit from more time in the barrel, it is morphing but the transformation is not entirely complete, I wouldnt mind an older version. Interesting but slightly conflicting beer, other 3 Pure Oak beers were clear improvement over the beer, this one is more about being different for me, an interesting direction, curious where this will go in the future meaning if he will explore ideas like this more & make other comparable beers. Interesting stuff for sure.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Before the festival, the brewer posted on his Facebook about how proud he was about this beer, he called it the best one of the series, and THE example of an oak aged beer ( fresh oak ) as if it were the best beer ever. I must say I agree with him about it being the best one of the series ! I really liked this balance , and its depth, that make it truly unique amongst other BA beers.
