Smak: słodkie, gładka tekstura, dobrze ułożone, kremowe, dominuje czekolada i przyprawowość. Przede wszystkim czekolada gorzka i praliny, bardzo mocno cynamon i kakao. Rodzynki i wanilia bardziej z tyłu, jeszcze leciutko wiśnie w czekoladzie, dające lekką cierpkość. Ciało średnie w kierunku sporego i w sumie dobrze, bo piwo nie jest za słodkie, smak jest bardzo wyraźny i intensywny. Goryczki niewiele, zarówno od chmieli, jak i tej od paloności. Lekkie odczucie ściągania na języku, alkohol ukryty, wysycenie niewielkie, piwo pozostawia bardzo przyjemny posmak w ustach i na języku. W sumie piwo zdecydowanie słodkie, nie powalające niczym, ale złożone, bogate i smaczne, fajnie zgrane i skomponowane.

The aroma shows huge notes of dark chocolate, raisins, oats, spices, vanilla, and sweet caramel malts. As it warms the cinnamon and raisins really come through making it more reminiscent of a oatmeal raisin cookie. The flavor follows and is very sweet from the toffee and caramel malts to go with dates, raisins, cinnamon, and oatmeal cookie. Some vanilla peaks through and adds depth while a touch of alcohol lets you know this is a big beer. Nearl full bodied and fairly slick on the mouthfeel with balanced carbonation that leads to a lingering cinnamon and raisin finish. Tastes like a really big and amplified oatmeal raisin cookie.
