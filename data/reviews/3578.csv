3578,"2016-08-31",4.3,"Bottle from a friend, undated, but assumedly fresh, drunk on 8/25/16.As soon as I popped the cap, the cork (which I didnt realize this had) began to push upwards, so I was thankfully ready with the glass when it explosively shot out....Big brassy-golden with lighter hay/marigold hues, a moderate haze and a rocky, white head showing strong retention for the style.Oh wow....this is some elegant stuff....Have to respect those taking the time to properly barrel age their sour ales and it really shows here, as compared to the majority of kettle-soured versions out there. Great wood tannin and lightly toasty oak help soften the sourness, in concert with the salinity. Honey, vanilla, and even approaching lambic-like funkiness. No edge to it and seems mellow and well-aged. No overt coriander and theres tons of minerality and complex acidity. No alcohol or flaw.Every bit as enjoyable and impressive, is the flavor, which shows soft wood tannin, light oak influences and tart, to mildly sour lactic acids and light brett funk. Tight carbonation and a strong, but well-attenuated maltiness create a soft, enjoyable texture, as light salinity continues to round things out playing perfect foil to the funky acidity. Incredibly pleasantly surprised by this one, having never heard of the brewery before. Would love to try more.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
