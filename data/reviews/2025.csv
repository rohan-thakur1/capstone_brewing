2025,"2013-11-20",4.0,"In short: A malty nutty brown ale with a generous refreshing fruity hopping. My type of beer.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed a few weeks after purchase, however fresh this Danish beer can be in a Vermont store.
The look: Cloudy brown body topped by a large beige head with medium retention.
In long: Nose is an inviting blend of citrusy hops over a layer of cashews and hazelnuts. In mouth the beer offers a rather corpulent body for a 6% brew with plenty of carbonation. Creamy cake malts, hazelnuts, dense whole-wheat bread, cashews, cacao. That solid nutty malt backbone is almost dominated by the refreshing citrusy hops (grapefruits, others). I love hoppy brown ale, Id like it to become a trend like Black IPAs or the more recent trend of White IPAs. This Autumnic Fallout is a very good example on how the harmoniously match a fat creamy nutty malt backbone with a sharp fruity IPA hopping. Looks like I appreciated this beer more than most people here, and I may rate beers against the grain but I never said I was better than everybody else here (I think it all the time but never said it).","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
