(Im not completely sold on mint, but that seems to be what Im getting here. I cant think of any other beers that werent advertised as ""mint"" beers that I have got that flavor on, though...)

3980,"2016-06-05",4.6,"""Blackened is the end"" - Metallica. Surly, what is this unholy concoction thou hast wrought? It pours black with a rich head that stays till the bitter end. And the end IS bitter, just as it is in the beginning. It starts with roasted malt bitterness. Tobacco, coffee, smoky wood, bitter chocolate. Then it changes into hop briskness. Zesty, leafy, woodsy (again, but different) and resinous. 999 is the new heretical number. Should you choose to drink of this wicked brew, you can abandon any hopes of peacefully shuffling off this mortal coil.

3980,"2016-05-12",4.2,"COD 1/26/16. Pours black, as advertised. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Outstanding, and surprisingly fruity, nose of pine, dank, citrus (lime) and tropical (passion fruit) hops. Underneath is a mild sweetness that I cant identify when cold, but seems to be caramel as it warms.

Light medium body that has a rather slick texture. Superb carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a prickly finish.

The quite outstanding flavor profile is unique. It begins with a blend that quickly devolves into lime, dank and pine. The middle provides a succulent caramel based sweetness that arrives in wave fashion. Underneath is a layer from the dark malts that hints at bakers chocolate and a touch of char, but not roast per se. Fairly mild bitterness arrives mid-palate and is a combination of pine, dank and zest. As the bitterness fades, the sweetness arrives coupled with a note of passion fruit. The finish is a slow sweet fade that takes on a zest quality as it lingers with dank and pine playing around the edges.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

3980,"2015-11-02",4.6,"Yields a motor oil black color, with a big, light brown, fluffy head.

Produces an intense, aromaful nose, consisting of big exotic fruit chunks, blending into roasty, warm earth. While the malts stay pleasantly focused on their mellow grain toast quality, the hops produce a great aroma diversity, featuring sappy lime, as well as juicy blood orange, creating an inviting complexity, while also adding a subtle sweetness to the malts. Never experienced a black ipa with such a profound resin quality, lending a rich ripeness to the fruity hops.

Has a creamy, rich mouthfeel to it, packing a pungent hop punch during the finish, amazingly well coated up by hops and malts, while resulting in a pleasant warmth. Very versatile on the palate, no notes of alcohol whatsoever, while the balance is able to handle all extremes going on in this.

This has such a clean, calm beginning, consisting of grain defined bread, bakers chocolate and a very soft aqueous quality, slowly turning into a creamy direction. After establishing this very smooth taste foundation, sour lime announces an uncompromising hop armada, while adding a bitter juice note as its harbinger, perfectly adding to the beers already established flavors. The following hop maelstrom overpowers them almost, if it werent for the throughout detectable creaminess in this, adding a subtle but effective balancing quality to the malts. Luscious orange, together with wet grass and prickly kiwi and a whiff of papaya exhibit the diversified hop profile, which displays an intense dryness, together with a malt compatible fruitiness, finally joined by a distinct roasty malt aspect. Flavors turn more and more intense, while reaching their peak after the swallow, soothed by the noteable roasted malts and creamy nouthfeel, still allowing the hops to produce a long lasting, lime aftertaste.

What an extreme beer, which is true for its taste and for its well working balance. Flavors dont ever seem to stop evolving on the palate, while never revealing any signs of its higher alcohol content at all, instead the beer is defined by an utmost smooth mouthfeel.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3980,"2015-05-01",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2015 Later in the day....at home....wow, amazing how different this beer is now.  Its interesting how some beers are profoundly affected by whatever youve eaten or drank beforehand.  Now this is closer to what I expect from a black IPA.  The licorice aspect is much more pronounced, as is the roasted grain, bridging into porter territory just a little.  That licorice is crazy.  I dont remember tasting that so strongly in a beer before.  A much more interesting beer now.

Sharing a can with beer buddies at the office.  Quite disappointed in this. I need to give it a second chance, so will likely update my review later on. Had some Toppling Goliath Golden Nugget before this, so figuring my palate is wrecked, even after some water.

Aroma is freaking mild paint thinner. WTF? Black color with a small tan head. Taste is mildly astringent, but strong bitterness, citrus and pine resin hops. I get some of the licorice others have noted, but no roasted grain, some coffee. ABV isnt outright obvious, but my tongue tastes a little and my face is getting warmed from it. Hopefully the next of the four I have will be better.","Illinois, USA","edwardbass"
3980,"2015-04-28",3.6,"16oz can pours a thick black color with a lot of frothy head. Smooth hoppiness. Lots of yeast flavor.","California, USA","Bule"
3980,"2015-04-18",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
Halfway between chocolate cake and fruit cake, this Imperial Black IPA sculpts tantalizing flavors spanning from licorice to coffee, all brushed by coniferous hops resins.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam covers the gleaming darkness.
-The mouthfeel is succulently rich.
-The flavor profile is different and memorable.
-There is balance within the intensity.
-Alcohol is well hidden by the hop bitterness and rich malt sugars.

3980,"2014-06-08",3.9,"On tap at Warrens Ale House in Wheaton, IL., and snifter served displaying a ruby highlighted, black/brown hue, with a billowing, and persistent head of tan head froth, and equally persistent lacing that coated the glass in a sheet-like fashion. The aroma was smooth creaminess to the malt, pronounced, citrusy grapefruit, and some resinous pine, with mellowed roastiness that took a back seat to the former notes. Dominant in the taste was a very lingering and strong bitterness that was earthy, citrusy, and tannic, with minor notes of wood, smoke & tar. The malt, and toffee & molasses sweetness allowed this hefty astringency to be quite palatable, although it did become a little syrupy, sticky, and overwhelming upon warming. Full bodied, with some warmth to the continuing sweetness & astringency of the finish. A bold & interesting brew that I enjoyed, but felt one time was enough, until I heard of the different nuances produced by the other collaborators in the various forms of conveyance.

If anything Blakkr appears a bit under carbonated. As for the taste, there is so much going on. This is definitely a sipper-slash end of evening-slash""dessert beer. It has the weight and mouthfeel of a substantial porter or stout with the earthy hop kick. By turns there is the dual bitterness of the hops and espresso like malts,then a strong molasses like sweetness and a delightful liquorice bite in the back end. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste but you will feel it by the end of the can. Absolutely no burn. The palate is very solid, It is sweet and bitter, round and dry by turns with a nice pop of citrus. For sweet stout lovers it will be familiar, for West Coast black IPA fans it maybe hoppy enough but a bit big on the sweet malts especially as it warms.

3980,"2014-05-04",3.8,"Reviewed from notes. Received in trade.
The appearance had a two finger off-white foamy head that wants to die within a minute but for the most part, it lasts for a good two and a half minutes (wow, I like it). Lacing is thick and foamy and clinging all around.
The smell had a nice bitter allocation of coffee to roasted malts, bitter and somewhat piney hops come in pretty powerful to invade my nose.
The taste was bitter and sweet at separate times, I do get some chocolate and I do get some roasted coffee-ness. The aftertaste is nice and smooth through a nice coffee/chocolate flavoring. The finish is fairly quick and dry.
On the palate, it sits about a medium on the body with a carbonation that is pretty good for the style and for me, nothing overly done but nothing subpar either.
Overall, I say this is a pretty good American Black Ale well worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Aroma is sour orange, or grapefruit, basically, citrus, with a little bit of roast to back it up. Very pungent aroma. This doesnt cross-over into the porter category at all, as has been my experience with some other Black IPAs. Truly, this is an IPA, that just happens to be darker in color. The citrus melds well with that oh-so subtle hint of pine. Theres a touch of roast and dryness to back this whole harmonious dance up. Overall, this is a great fucking Black IPA.

Pours black with a small head and decent lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is just a bunch of juicy fruit forward hops. There is very little roast character to speak of in the nose... most of which I would guess would be indistinguishable if I were blindfolded. Some dank & oniony hops come through I let it swish around a bit... as does some springtime grass, but mostly its just fruit forward hops. 

The flavor is very happy with a moderate level of bitterness. Its got a touch of roast and licorice but thats all nicely kept to a minimum. Its only a touch boozy and Im very surprised to see this one weigh in at 10%...

3980,"2014-03-23",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2016 Update:  -1 taste, -2 overall.  Good stuff overall, but this is really raw and dirty and I cant give it any more at this point.  Its $3.25 a can at Costco, and its just not quite there.  Good Black IPA, but not worth the price.  Dry and earthy.  Its sneaky.
Update:  -1 aroma, -2 overall.  Still a great beer.  Aroma, especially when in the can, is great.  The darkness is countered with some serious pine needles.  Maybe its different this year - more likely its just me.  Not quite as stellar and desirable as I remember, but still a great beer.  Very high intensity but still balanced.
Update:  +1 overall.  This is the best black IPA I can imagine. This beer is amazing.  Pours an oily dark brown with decent brown head and lacing.  Aroma is all Furious - signature Surly hop profile with just a hint of the big alcohol.  Taste is Furious with more resin, alcohol, and some chocolate malts.  In making Furious ""black"", Surly has achieved a beer that is not roast-heavy and cocoa bitter, but rather thick, oily, earthy and rich.  For me, this is the ideal flavor profile for a Black IPA.  10% ABV with no indication in the taste.  It will be a shame if this is a one-time collaboration brew.  Outstanding beer.  A crazy $4.50 per 16oz can, but somehow its worth the indulgence.Pours dark like it should. Aroma is big sweet floral hops with fruit, all of which stays dominant through the taste. The back seat roast works well with the hop profile. Its Furious with a bit more roast in the malts and an undetectably higher ABV.

3980,"2014-03-15",3.9,"HMOG 2014. Poured out of the bottom of can thanks to Lee wanting to preserve all things can-like. Big sweet pine and citrus, malty, bit of cocoa. Really nice black ipa. I feel like this style gets a bad wrap, but anyone who decides to do it normally does it really well and this is no exception.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
3980,"2014-03-13",3.8,"16 ounce can. Pours almost black with a nice tan head. Aroma of fruit, floral, malt, and pine. Taste is grapefruit, tropical fruit, pine, floral, malt, coffee, and chocolate. A lot going on here.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"

3980,"2014-03-08",3.7,"Black pour, thick tan head.
Aroma is chocolate malt, citrusy and woody hop.
Citrus and chocolate, piney, light through the finish. Not as deep roast flavour as I expected.

3980,"2014-03-06",4.5,"Khaki colored head and a black color that barely turns crimson red when held to a light; Good lacing. Aroma of mangoes, citrus hops, orange peel, mild chocolate malts and lemons. Flavor of citrus & piney hops, mangos, roasted barley, chocolate malts and a chocolate-orange/resin aftertaste. Heavy body but light carbonation. Very tasty and a must have!","","BeerKurve"

3980,"2014-03-05",4.0,"Draft at Butcher and the Boar. Pours a jet black color with a big tan head and some lacing. Aroma is hoppy, tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, grapefruit. Medium on the palate with creamy carbonation. Flavor is a sweet, malty, roasty, bitter, coffee, hoppy, grapefruit, with a bittersweet chocolate finish. Excellent.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
3980,"2014-03-04",4.0,"This monster pours an almost black color with an off white head. Big hop flavors and aromas that are kept in check by some nice chocolate and caramel. I would enjoy this one fresh to get all the nice hop goodness.","","redbeard3"
3980,"2014-03-03",3.2,"Can @ Brewbies 2014. Black pour with a khaki head. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, and herbal hops. Sweet dark fruit, some cocoa powder, pine, and a bit of citrus rind. Flavor is intensely bitter and a touch chalky. Herbal, woody, and piney hop character with very light citrus (mostly bitter pith and rind). Cocoa powder, lots of roasted malt, and coffee. Kind of astringent to me. Not a big fan.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3980,"2014-03-02",3.7,"Can, pours a pitch black body with a thin, light brown head that quickly dissipates. Strong hop aroma, mainly citrus, apricot, and grapefruit with some pine.

3980,"2014-03-02",3.4,"Cask pour at Night of the Living Ales 2014 (Chicago, IL). Pours a dark blackish brown hue, well hazed and near opaque with some gentle brownish glow on the bottom and edges. A thicker bubbly light brown head atop stays as a frothy layer, laces ok. Aromas are tropical fruit, sweeter hop fruity complexity with some citrus, bready malts, florals, and gentle pine. A touch sweet. Initial is decently bitter, a touch thicker with some gentle black malt, fruity hops meet pine and floral bitterness. Touches of grapefruit rind, citrus and pine touch. Some gentle girthy body on a bit more display due to the cask carbonation levels. Backend is a bit of tropical fruit, gentle toastiness and bready malt. The fruit dominates more than the FFF version, the cask carbonation makes it a bit thicker. The fruity hop element seems to dominate here, which would be awesome, but a lack of carbonation and lacking overall complimenting bitterness seems the downgall here. A bit of a one trick pony and a bit sweet/fruity without really showing much ""Black IPA"" character. This deserves a re-rate via can pour, gotta stand as it is for now though.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3980,"2014-03-01",4.4,"16oz can at home, poured in Imperial pint glass. Great roasty-toasty aroma wafting from tan head. Balanced amount of hops, even from a Surly IPA. This beer went down easily and quickly!","","Jkindelspire"
3980,"2014-02-27",4.1,"16 oz can. Deep brown nearing black with a big tan head. Strong resinous, piney apricot hops with a sugary malt background and tea. Quite sweet with a piney bitter finish. Body is heavier with a cough syrup consistency. Awesome can art and nice to have a black ipa without the burnt sugar or black licorice aromas dominant. Also cool to see a special brew in regular packaging instead of a bomber.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"
3980,"2014-02-27",4.0,"Nice black pour with a tan head, aroma is big citrus notes like Abrasive. Taste is bold citrus and fades into some chocolate maltiness, nice.","Farmington, Minnesota, USA","XmnwildX12"

3980,"2014-02-27",3.8,"February 27, 2014 - on tap at the brewery. Black pour with some head. Citrus hops and roasted malt in aroma. Taste was consistent with aroma, but also had some chocolate.

3980,"2014-02-27",3.8,"Tap at Surly. Pours black with substantial brown head, fluffy head. Aroma is citrus hops, some roasted malts. Taste is that of an IPA, I get very little of the roasted malts, chocolate, etc. that usually accompany a black IPA. It is black only in appearance really. Tastes somewhat close to Abrasive, really a pretty good beer and cool artwork.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
3980,"2014-02-27",4.0,"Can at home. Pours a dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of pine, roast, malt and citrus. Very solid brew.","Minnesota, USA","sprybry"
3980,"2014-02-26",4.1,"Color me shocked. I typically hate this style, but this IPA wasnt all that black besides the color. Nice full hoppy aroma, similar to abrasive. Flavor is pretty sweet up front with tons hops in the finish. Almost no roast, great beer.","Minnesota, USA","Steasy66"
3980,"2014-02-26",4.3,"16 oz. can. Labeled as ""III Floyds. Surly. Real Ale. Blakkr Imperial Black Ale."" This is the Surly-brewed and canned version. Excellent hops dominate the aroma. Fresh, herbal, woody, earthy, mouthwatering smell features pine, peach, raspberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, salt, and peat scents. Roasted malts do make their presence felt in the aroma. Pours an opaque, dark brown with a pronounced amber hue. Small amount of short-lasting taupe head. Produces little and short-lasting lacing. The beer is not nearly as dark in color as the name implies. Honestly, the average stout is at least as blakk or even blakkr (sorry; I couldnt help myself). That said, I actually like the appearance better as an amber-tinted dark brown than as a black beer. Dryness initially dominates the flavor, but a tasty maltiness develops upon multiple sips. Boozy. Citrus (lemon and grapefruit) and milk chocolate. There is a pronounced earthiness, evoking the rich, dark soil of fertile farmland. Light, piney, dry aftertaste. Medium to heavy body. Soft in the palate; its very typically a Surly beer in its oaty softness. Remarkably easy to drink. Blakkr is surprisingly light, pleasant, friendly, and happy. Its not the Abrasive/Darkness cross that many have speculated. Rather, it is more a hoppy double brown, a Double Bender if you well (I apologize for my Surly-centricity, but I am a Minnesotan, after all). It is more hippy blues rock than heavy metal, the Cream of beers, despite the brewers inspiration. It may be arguably mis-marketed, but it is highly enjoyable and likable. I gave a bonus point to the overall score for all-around excellence and satisfaction.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3980,"2014-02-26",4.1,"Picked up a four-pack at Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, Minnesota. Pours an opaque dark brown colored brew with a rocky beige head that really sticks to the glass edge, even in a plastic cup, with all the lacing expected. Dont even think of using a plastic cup, Glass It! Aroma of citrusy and floral hops, grapefruit, a hint of Bakers chocolate, coffee and a hint of white pine. Taste is full bodied, soft carbonation with flavors of dark chocolate, cascade-ish/grapefruity hops, white pine and toasted dark malts. Finish is quite thick for a BIPA with a well balanced chocolate/sweet dark malt and grapefruit aftertaste with a sweet citrus and red grapefruit aftertaste. Unlike anything else Ive tried from Surly. Malty, sweet citrusy hoppy, alcohol warmth, and oily finish. Couldnt ask for a more suitable and full-bodied beer to be released during this year of the Multi-Polar Vortexes.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
3980,"2014-02-26",4.2,"Tap. Dark black pour, ample 1/2 head of lasting carbonation and an aroma of mellow dark roasty malt and nice noticeable hops.

3980,"2014-02-26",4.0,"Aroma of piney root beer and citrus. Dark reddish brown with fading tan head. Taste is bitter, resiny, with some slight alcohol.

3980,"2014-02-25",4.2,"Can pour into an IPA glass. Darkness abounds, moderate to heavy foam. Aromas of malty grapefruit. Bitterness hides the higher (9.99%) abv. A bit spendy since its $3 more than Abrasive... but a great BIPA.","Minnesota, USA","mnmike"
3980,"2014-02-23",3.9,"Can at the release party at Grumpys NE. Black pour with a monster tan head. Pine notes in the aroma. Taste is pine, some citrus sweetness, and roast. Big and bold. Very good!","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
