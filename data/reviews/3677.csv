3677,"2017-06-04",4.0,"Somewhat aged 50 cl bottle from Drankencentrale De Moor. Pale beige, creamy, lightly lacing head settling into a moussy rim over a very dark bronze beer, close to blackish in general appearance, but with hazy mahogany-hued, translucent edges. Aroma of toasted walnuts, fondant chocolate, dried blueberries, sweet red wine, toffee, cold tea, toasted bread, old brownies, raisins, dry tree leaves. Dried fruits in the mouth, hints of fig and dried banana slices, restrained sweetishness with a very soft dried berry-ish sourish touch, softish carbonation, smooth and lightly oily mouthfeel. Nutty and toffeeish malt sweet body with toasted bittering edges but softly so, leafy and herbal, almost tea-ish hop bitterish finish with ongoing nutty malts and a dash of sherry-ish, warming alcohol. Very nice example of this old style, among the best I had so far, this is English ale tradition at its best.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3677,"2011-06-09",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
This complex Porter presents raisins, coffee beans, chocolate and licorice in an oily and sweet body which might get cumbersome after a while.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the dark brown.
-The low carbonation makes the body feel heavier.
-Fruity angles don¬ít necessarily mesh with the bold coffee flavors.
-The complexity is impressive, but drinkability is too low for my tastes in the style.
-Fruitiness nears on being acetic at times.

3677,"2010-04-23",4.1,"Bottle.

A - Dark cola black with a large, frothy, creamy, rocky tan head with above average retention and a nice bit of creamy lacing left.

S - Strong roasted espresso coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malt smell. Good amount of dark fruit (blackberry, date, black currant and raisin), licorice, and some brown sugar/molasses. 

T - Initially there is a pretty strong dark fruit (similar to the nose) and chocolate taste. This is slightly tart and slightly sweet. Then a heavy amount of roasted malt, coffee, and other roasted slightly bitter porter flavors come in. Also present is a touch of licorice and brown sugar along with the dark fruit. This creates a slightly bitter taste with some sweetness and tartness to balance it out a bit. On the finish, some earthy flavors become present and the dark fruit makes a strong comeback and lingers on the tongue.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Smooth and a bit creamy.

D - Good drinkability. Well balanced flavors, with there being some strong porter flavors but not necessarily heavily roasted flavors but a good amount of fruitiness. Good easy to drink porter that is a little on the higher side of ABV. 

Notes: ABV = 7.5%. Enjoyable porter that is well balanced and tasty. Nothing outstanding about it, but it is good and easy to drink. Fruity, roasted, and porter flavors are good. Definitely worth a try.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Barley-wine-like sweet aroma. Sweet and fruity in the taste too, and undeniably quite strong. We blew hot and cold during this one. At it¬ís best it was fantastic (3.6+), but it was a bit over-powering, and we lost the details after a while. Should rerate.

Roast and smoky aroma with some cherry and prune fruit alongside some earthy hops and if you really look for it a citrus note (found after 3 pints, but found again when sober!).  Good mouthfeel and carbonation with a creamy but full body.  Obvious flavours of coffee and chocolate are in abundance with vine fruit, liqourice, smoke and generous bitterness.

Each mouthfull seems to bring forward new dark flavours - chocolate, coffee, tobacco. Though dark and warm and gently tangy, nothing is overdone - there is a balanced about everything, and a long slow ride into the lingering, oh so lingering, finish. Red fruits come through - hard to pin down exactly, but with just enough fruit to balance the dark tobacco and peppery spice. An absolute sensation!
