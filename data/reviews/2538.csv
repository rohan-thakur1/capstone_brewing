Clear golden color with a huge foamy off-white head.
Not that pretty. Floral hops, mild bitterness, mild sweetness and some malt in the aroma. Not the freshest aroma. The flavor is floral and fruit tea hops, moderate bitterness, dryness, tree leaves and malt. Nåjå...

2538,"2015-02-28",3.2,"Bottle. A hazy, golden-orange beer with a dense, finger-thick off-white head. The aroma is piney and grapefruity, with some grainy malts in the back. Its medium bodied and a bit heavy on the carbonation, semi-dry, with flavors of grains in the back. Resins, grapefruit and some flowery and peachy hints in the flavor. Pleasant bitterness too, lasting for some time. For a 2.8% beer its sure a fine one, but it lacks some quenching qualities. 150228","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
