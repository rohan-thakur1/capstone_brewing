2568,"2015-07-09",4.3,"La grange est habitée par tellement de locataires à commencer par une famille de levures en suspens très tapageuse. Des houblons approchés par des bactéries charognardes et une émulsion savonneuse occupent les autres chambres. Un complexe et complet liquide hautement rustique.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
2568,"2015-06-27",4.1,"Pours a light golden color with three fingers of tight white foam. Beautiful beer, crisp clean pilsner style malt backbone with layer of citrus, tart vinous acidity, pine, spruce slightly gin influence. Light refreshing body with tons of complexity and drinkability !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
2568,"2015-06-21",4.0,"750ml bottle shared thanks to Lukaduke! Pours bright hazy yellow with big head. Nose is bright with grassy spice, some herbal spruce and greens, pine, lemon and citrus, light grain. Taste is similar with light crisp body, bright doughy grass, lemon grain, floral, leafy spruce and herbal spice, soft tartness. Finishes dry and crisp, light grain, grassy lemon, refreshing. Very nice!","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
2568,"2015-05-02",3.7,"5oz on tap at OEC during Nepenthia. Totally hazy golden color. Little ring of white head. Couple dots of lace. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of crisp lighter carbonation. Mildly slick. Kind of yeasty overall. Good bigger floral hop. Moderate tart, light to moderate sweet, mild bitter taste. More dry finish. Very solid sour ale, whatever kind of variant you want to call it -- not entirely sure here judging from the description, but it drinks basically like a sour saison.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2568,"2015-04-23",3.7,"En fût. Verre de dégustation directement à la brasserie. Arôme: Légère odeur dagrumes avec une pointe dépices. Apparence: La couleur est blonde opaque. Présence dun mince col mousseux et dune fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût dagrumes avec une pointe dépices et de céréales. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement onctueuse. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Arrière goût floral. (Rating #6284)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
2568,"2015-03-29",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Citrusy acidity, prominent wheat, floral hops and spicy wood collaborate in this rustic whirlwind of a brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A large head of foam crowns the murky beige.
-This may not be as refined as their Exilis, but it is mighty flavorful.
-Not quite sure what the lager aspect of it is supposed to be. Dont think their commercial description accurately portrays what is happening in this beer. Whatever, it is a very pleasant sour brew.
-Carbonation is ample and comfortable.
-The mouthfeel is nicely dry.
-This is eons away from what a Heller Bock is today.

On tap at the brewery taproom.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2568,"2015-03-04",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Pours hazy golden with a small head. Aroma of light tartness, floral hops, light malts, and hints of wheat. Flavor the same with a nice blend. Average texture. A really cool beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2568,"2015-03-01",4.0,"Poured in sampler glass at the brewery: Pours copper with a nice white head. Aroma is tartness, spices, grass, and some floral notes. Taste is very tart, a little sweet with a bit of a dry hopped grassy, floral bite at the back end. Awesome wild / saison / sour.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
2568,"2015-01-18",4.0,"Lemony almost tart aroma and flavor. Earthy barnyard flavors. Has saison qualities and I sense some Brett like qualities. Really nice flavors and complex beer. Reminds me of some beers made by crooked stave, but not the lactic sour type. Very nice!!

2568,"2014-11-29",4.0,"Bottle. Pours orange gold white head. Nose/taste of citrus peel, orange peel, funk, lemon, pine and soured wheat malt. Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
2568,"2014-11-28",4.1,"OEC is back in my good graces with this unique lovely beer. Probably should be a sour wild but who am I to judge since i think the brewer added the beer. Pours a light copper golden color with nice fluffy head. Aroma is lactic tartness, spicy floral hops, lavender?, dusty, and fun! Taste is moderate lactic tartness dry hopping that brings out floral spicy grassy hops. Really unique and tasty wild ale.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
