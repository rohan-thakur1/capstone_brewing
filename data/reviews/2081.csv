Flavor wasnt quite as hoppy, which was a bit surprising based on the aroma.  Flavor was good and well balanced.  Caramel and toasted malt with some vanillal and spices.  A really good version for the style.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"

2081,"2007-08-28",3.6,"served on tap. poured amber in color with a thin tan head that dissipated rather quickly. the aroma was quite sweet, and the taste seemed to match. quite creamy and delicious. not the easiest beer to finish, but definitely a good take on a saison.","Alabama, USA","smashteroid"
2081,"2007-07-14",2.8,"On tap at the Beachwood BBQ.  Pours a mostly hazy, deep ruddy amber color with a thin layer of off-white head.  Aromas of cherry gumdrops, bubblegum, and a mild white pepper spice.  Medium-full bodied, creamy carbonated mouthfeel.  Lots of honey and floral rose petals on the front of the palate, but finishes heavy and sticky sweet with a final smack of bandagey bubblegum.  Too heavy and cloying to be highly drinkable.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
2081,"2007-06-24",3.6,"On tap @ Stone - Pours a hazy orangish- amber color with a small off white head that faded pretty quick.  No lacing.  Aroma is spice, light yeast, and esters.  Flavor is the same.  Medium body.  This is one of the more spicey beers Ive tried.  A good one.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"

This beer sits in my glass with a somewhat hazy, dark amber, purple hued color.  It is topped by a frothing, fat finger thick, dark tan head that has some staying power to it and even leaves some lacing on the sides of the glass.  The aroma has a pronounced mix of spice and fruit notes; the spices lean towards clove and the fruit notes definitely are concentrated (I get notes of prunes, figs and perhaps some raisins).  The malt aromas mix in with the dark fruit notes, but I do get notes of caramelized malt and browned biscuits.

A light carbonation makes for a smooth drinking beer.  There is a prominent clove character here, but also a hint of nutmeg and allspice.  Dark fruit flavors of fig and raisin come into play.  Some cardamom like spice character is vaguely evocative of the flavors in cola.  The body has a medium fullness to it and this has quite a bit of heft to it considering I was expecting a lighter beer.  This is a nice beer for the cooler months, while not thick, it does have a certain hardness to it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2081,"2006-06-05",3.5,"Barrel Aged draft @ Lucky Baldwins 12/05:  Clear amber color with a minmal off-white head.  Some funky notes in the aroma right off the bat.  Clovey spice, leather, estery.

2081,"2005-10-01",3.7,"Draft at Obriens.  Pretty good stuff.  Medium Amber red color with not a lot of head.  Aromas were sweet with a bit of cherry in there.  The rest was very malty.  Malty flavors and a bit of wood from the oak aging.  I like it.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"
2081,"2005-09-11",3.4,"(Draft: 2005 Stone 9th Anniversary Festival in Escondido, CA) My first beer of this festival is a good one.  This version of Craftsmans Biere de Mars is barrel fermented with Brettanomyces, so its probably a bit different from the standard version.  The nose is somewhat sour, spicy, fruity, some banana and general funk.  Similar notes in the flavor, with banana and spices, but also some tart cherry from start to finish.  Moderate bitterness in the finish is the only thing Im not liking in this beer.  Amber color, fully clear, with a steady stream of carbonation bubbles rising through the beer.  The off-white head is small on the pour, but slowly subsides to a broken film, leaving some patchy lacing.  Light-medium in body, very clean and refreshing.  Nice start to the festival.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

2081,"2005-04-03",3.2,"Sampled with SoCal RB guys...thanks to whomever who brought this...Smoked bacon notes with hints of licorice.  Corn husks are also detected.  Barnyard notes.  In a way, this resembles a rauchbier.  The aroma is all over the place.  Moderate/severe hazy copper/amber color with a small white head.  Nice flavors- sweet, fruity banana-cloves.  Sugary to start.  Finishes bitter and a little astringent for me.  Nice flavor.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
