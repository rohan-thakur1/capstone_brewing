2871,"2017-01-23",4.4,"Bytemesis supplied, many thanks! 
 750 mL bottle.  No bottle date to be found.   The bleak western-drabness of its stickered label actually made it stand out with me. It was so glaringly simple yet the choice of playful colors (red, black, and light beige) was stunningly meticulous as to how they were used.  To red wine glass, it pours a cloudy light orange that a snowy white head attached itself up on. Wonderful.  The aroma is an assault of tropical fruit sexiness, springtime flowers, and sourdough yeast starters. I managed to retrieve guava, dried mangoes, canned pineapple juice, fresh sourdough, clementine zest, and wheat upon taking my first few sniffs. All sensations remained unbearably the same even after the 10 minute mark, though a touch of algae, soured milk, farmhouse yeast, and peas did oversee some small part of action lingering in the back.  Altogether flavor is what I could best describe as ""cocktail-in nature"": expensive champagne, orange and clementine juice, table sugar, dry bitters, and lime. This almost perfectly represents the mimosa. I havent tried Hill Farmsteads glorious attempt, but I can only guess its just as good - though Id probably reckon that there would be an overabundance of orange juice in the flavor. This one doesnt really have much tropical sting aside from whats riding in the background faintly muttering out of the loud choruses of funk, champagne, and pale malts. Rice malt experienced alongside sweat, crushed coriander, pea water, wildflower honey,and noble hops convincingly at swallow.  An inventively sturdy sour milkiness hides a barely-existing alcohol heat in its maltose bosom, burning bright and massive, until my next sip. Lavender only merely hinted at after its swallow.  This is a fantastic saison: just as good as anything Ive had from HF.  I may have been wondering if the abv was higher while I was on a half-glass of this beauty, because feeling the burn was an inevitable occurrence. It wasnt potent, but certainly wouldnt be misremembered. 
 Age this on fruit and you will have the best sasion the world has ever known.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

2871,"2016-08-21",3.9,"750mL bottle shared with Blisscent at Hill Farmstead on 8/11/16.Huge white head is well-retained and tops a lightly hazy, deep blonde-golden body.Minerality is high in the nose, with gentle acidity and mild yogurt-like suggestions, but no one yeast/bacteria note dominating. Lemon character grows strong, with lots of peppery phenol and light fruitiness from the hops, but again not dominated by either hop flavor or acidity. Malts add biscuit, strong honey and just a pinch of caramel and it all comes off very well-integrated with no alcohol or flaw.Very soft, malty texture shows ample, tight carbonation and good attenuation overall. Quite big on the mineral character with even some strong salinity that takes the edge of any potential hop bitterness and softens the acidity produced by the mixed culture. This creates a bit more perceived sweetness than I think is actually here and really highlights both malt/grain character as well as the esters from the yeast. Some tartness still emerges on the finish, inevitably and it never comes off too sweet, some light oak tannin dryness helping to see to that, as well. Not much of a hop footprint here, which I like, but the mixed culture still sees it straddling line between traditional saison and American sour ale (despite it not being sour). Love the minerality/salinity. Not the most complex saison, but very enjoyable and drinkable nonetheless.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

I picture the wave washing up upon the shore if my tongue, the moisture saturating the porpoise sand, as the wave ebbs into the ocean once again, the dry salinity lifts up into the seabreeze of the next inhalation. Beautiful beer in every facet and regard. Clearly made with the unique, all-to-rare convergence of precocious talent and sincere love and passion. If the brewer of this beer is reading this, please know that this beer was a truly special experience. Thank you. Perfect.

Pours very hazy vibrant orangish yellow with a big fizzy and frothy white head that slowly dissipates while leaving some soapy lacing and trace on the glass. Smell is funky, fruity and tiny picy with crackers, barnyard, pink grapefruit juice, blood orange juice, hay, dry soil, leather, white pepper corns, lemon zest, cape gooseberries, dry wood, white grapes, pear skins and subtle hints of cereal.

2871,"2014-02-01",3.5,"750 ml bottle shared with Prufrockstar
Im pleased to get a chance to try Sante Adairius; just starting to hear some positive buzz and of course I love the rustic ales angle. Pours the color of pineapple juice with a whipped egg white head. Intensely funky aroma compared to the Prairie Elisa5eth that preceded it, heavy latrine and some lactic aromas. The flavor follows fairly closely: lemon-juice puckering lead-in, tannic cherry pit, brett, leather, turning to a strong bitter element (more tannins?) late that seem like a flaw, as if it is trying too hard at the end. This one has a lot of interesting elements and hints at good things to come from Sante Adairius, but it doesnt really come together like Id want and up with a mid-range score.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2871,"2014-01-30",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2015 750 ml bottle, thanks to bytemesis. Ive been looking forward to this one for awhile! Pours murky gold-yellow. Carls ""pineapple juice"" is appropriate. Frothy white head, great lacing. Aroma: whoa funk. Ripe, juicy fruit in the aroma. Sweetness comes through with the funk -- lemon-pepper sweet tarts? Do those exist? Taste: dry (and I mean dry!) and puckering -- only lightly tart, but puckering nonetheless. After acclimating, the sweetness starts to come back. Medium body, slick texture, oily and mouth-coating, lively carbonation. Overall: nice enough, but next to eliza5beth this plays second fiddle. Glad there are folks brewing like this, at any rate!   draft at SARA 6/7/15. Murky gold pineapple juice again. Ring of bubbles. Minimal lacing. Aroma is out of this world. Apricot purée with lemon zest. Tart, citrus, pepper, mineral. Everything I want in the aroma for a tart saison. Taste is a little less inspiring (still good, but honestly a letdown). Tart, lightly botanical, toast, sour lemon curd. Once I acclimate it grows on me some, but theres something in the flavor profile that feels misplaced ... Makes me think of weeds picked from the side of a dusty highway in north Idaho. Which is not without its charm, but if that wasnt there I imagine Id be happier. Lacto almost vomity sour. Lively carbonation. Soft feel regardless (do they treat their water?). I like this more than the bottle I shared with Crow ... probably worth revisiting from time to time. Too bad I dont live in capitola(?). Upped from 3.8 to 4. On the cusp of going higher ...","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

2871,"2013-08-24",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2014 Bottle (Batch 2) part of an American Farmhouse/Saison tasting. Pours a hazy golden color with a sexy 2-finger thick foam. Aroma is dominated by funky, barnyard must, lemon, biscuit, hay and honey with lingering fruit skins (peaches, nectarines). It smells fruity, earthy and refreshing. Taste follows aroma, but with a more tart, cheeky presence than aroma suggests. The beer is balanced with the perfect level of must, funk and fruit esters. It is very refreshing and thirst quenching with a medium body, medium carbonation and semi-dry finish. I like that the beer is not as lemon forward as some Saisons tend to be, and not overly earthy with the addition of the brett. It is a juicy and flavorful Saison that stands out from the crowd of American farmhouse beers. Update: Have tried Batches 2-9 at this point, and with each batch its starting to get more dialed-in in terms of apricot, orange, citrus flavor. The appealing part of Bernice is its juicyness.

Medium bodied, lively carbonation, soft acidity, great funk. Amazingly refreshing. Demonstrates that SARA is legit.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
2871,"2013-07-13",4.6,"Pours clear, aroma was sweet with slight funky farmhouse nose. Taste is slightly tart and amazing, with some barnyard and earthy tones the barrel aging has added complexity to this delicious beer.","","Humboldtsean"
2871,"2013-07-11",3.9,"Pour is darker hazy yellow with a white head. The nose is very nice, strong funky Saison yeast that is very earthy and mushroomy. Some juicy lemon balance and a faint dusty tones. Taste is a touch sweeter, decent yeast presence, earthy an dusty, more prevalent lemon, grassy hops, light bitterness. Medium body, light carbonation and a semi dry finish.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
2871,"2013-07-01",4.6,"Pours a hazy orange juice gold with no head. Aroma of funky Brett, lacto and citrus. Taste is funky, tart, citrusy. Refreshing with no alcohol presence. This beer is in my top three saisons. Funky and tart yet really drinkable. I love this beer!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
2871,"2013-06-27",4.8,"Cloudy yellowish pour, nice big white head. Oh my god this is freaking good. Its like a combo of a russian river golden sour and a wonderful belgian saison. WOW. Tart and funky and fruity and soft. UNREAL.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2871,"2013-06-19",4.4,"Apple, pear, some oakiness on the nose. Pours clear golden color, bubbly but dissipates quickly. Very delicate flavor, kind of watery thin at first but after a few seconds the complexity begins to open up on the palate. Fruity tartness, champagne-like dryness. Leaves a delicious nutty, woody aftertaste. I love the transitions in this beer: sweet to dry, fruity to nutty. Subtle and unique experience, a fantastic spin on saison style, definitely the best Sante Adairius Ive tried thus far.","California, USA","barn0216"
2871,"2013-06-07",4.6,"Bottle. March 2013 release. Simply awesome! Basically a sour saison.. Serious mouthwatering lime nuances.. with layers of mild, lactic funk and tons of complexity. Definitely wild yeast overtones and citrus... Very well balanced, light and refreshing. Low carbonation, with a tart, dry finish. Simple and enjoyable, yet so complex. A must try. Seems to just keep getting better and better with time in the bottle.

2871,"2013-06-04",4.2,"Thanks to Dave for this bottle. Bright orange pour with a large white head. Really excellent aroma. Crisp, dry, and yeasty. Lime zest, cracker, and a subtle tartness. Hints of apple and banana. Big lime, yeast, cracker, and lemon flavors. Subtle tartness, apple, banana, and a hint of grass. Excellent.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2871,"2013-05-24",3.7,"Thanks to Roger for hooking me up in celebration of the day when I turned from a strapping young ticker to an old, creepy, has-been ticker. In the interest of full disclosure, my granny is named Bernice so I might be biased. Thank you, granny, for allowing me to be brought into this world so that I might experience the great joy of ticking 3000+ beers. With that, here goes another tick.

This beer looks attractive to me for reasons I dont understand, sort of like the female alien in ""Avatar"" (I cant blame Jake for hitting that - I would). It has just the right amount of haziness in its golden-orange color with a little bit of foam and lacing. It smells great, similar to the heavenly aroma you get from putting your nose to a goat or a horse or a wet pile of hay. Barnyard with plenty of blanket, yeasty and funky with Brett notes (the yeast, not a person of that name). The flavor also has Brett (the yeast), which lends a nice restrained tartness, along with sour green apple. The palate is reasonably crisp but it could use some more carbonation. Solid and enjoyable beer overall.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
2871,"2013-05-17",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2014 This rating is from a b2 bottle aged 3 months or so and the tartness really shines. the fresher the bottle, the more the yeast and ""sante"" house bugs character can be seen. A - pours hazy light golden orange with very low white head. S -the nose is something nice funky yeasty citrus aromas. Nice balance of all the right elements. Soft subtle funk, notes of sulfur and barnyard. Quiet bready yeasts. Prickly pineapple and fresh ripe oranges and very slight lemon rind. M - lively bright mf. Average carb. Very fruit forward, with a lingering lightly sweet almost tart end. T - very fruity up front, pineapple, fresh oranges and lemon zest. Fresh tart apples, mineral water and subtle funk. Yeasts, barnyard and bread on the palate. Dry, Fruity mineral water end. Very subtle cheese funk. O - an amazing subtle, complex very refreshing. 4.6","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
2871,"2013-04-27",4.1,"Bottle at home, acquired via trade. Big thanks to Felipe for this one!! Pour is hazy orange with a big white head and great lacing. Sour grain, lemon peel, biscuit, somewhat funky, light urine, straw, dough, tangerines, and white pepper in the aroma. Taste is highly refreshing - citrus, sour fruit, biscuit, a touch pepper, straw, light grass, wheat, peaches, apricots, and lemon zest with a medium sour finish. Light body with high carbonation. Highly drinkable, tart and refreshing, but has spice notes and floral characterisrics. Really nice beer. These guys are something to watch out for.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
2871,"2013-04-13",4.1,"Tap, Batch #3. Pours hazy golden amber with a small white head and good lacing. Aroma is Brett, funky, bit of horse blanket, fruity, lemon. Flavor is lightly sweet, medium tart, only light funk, with a semi dry finish. Light-plus body. Very easy to drink.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2871,"2013-03-18",4.3,"Bottle. Pours a hazy almost tan golden body topped by a medium sized eggshell white head that left no lacing. Nose is bright but lightly sweet citrus, some apple, dusty earth, yeast, and a touch of brett funk. Flavor has mild spice, tart lemon, some white wine notes, with dry malt underneath it all. Any sweetness fades and funk increases as it warms. Great acidity throughout leads to drying, mouthwatering finish. Palate is medium and carbonation is crisp. Balanced, complex and so, so good.","Soquel, California, USA","tripelthreat"
2871,"2013-01-05",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2014 Glass at the brewery, on tap. Pours golden, slight white head. Fresh soury saisony aroma and taste. Clean and crisp. Nice.","Washington, USA","HughConway"
2871,"2012-12-24",3.9,"Pale golden/apricot color slightly hazy with fine white foam. High effervescence, spritzy. Mild astringency. Beautiful aroma hay, citrus fruit oranges and touch of grapefruit - medium full.  Acidic and sharp on the tongue, lightly sour. Mild white vinous notes. Second pour, buoyed yeast bodies, large. More barnyard aromas emerging as it warms, 51 degrees.  Admittedly off-put by the dreadlock chunk of yeast that broke free from the bottom and moved into the glass, this beer is now becoming more and very charming.   Citrus tang with a touch of phenol, clove, becoming more apparent as it warms 54 degrees. In a bright and good direction.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
2871,"2012-12-12",4.3,"750mL bottle, courtesy of Tim at Sante. Thanks, Tim! I really enjoyed the Anaïs saison (sans Brett), and this was indicated to be the epitome of where Sante Adairius saison are headed. Lets hope so, because this is damn good. Pours a slightly hazy, deep-golden color; creamy, well-formed fine-bubbled white head with excellent lacing and retention. Nicely developed tartness in the aroma, showing lemony citrus, just-ripe bananas, and a touch of salinity; juicy Brett character with firm, honey-laden notes underneath. Medium body; effervescent CO2; a sturdy acidity throughout. If I had to gloss over the details and explain this beer in a phrase, it would be ""peppery saison crossed with a younger lambic."" Juicy Brettiness plus mouthwatering acidity, some light funk and hay-like notes, plus the firmness of a honeyed, white-pepper-focused saison; not overly dried out (but dry), not overly acidic or tart (but both); not quite like any other Brett-influenced saison Ive tried. The finish is ideal: toasty and dry, with just a hint of popcorn husks and Pils malt and pepper. Yes.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2871,"2012-12-08",4.6,"Aroma is a balanced blend of citrus and barnyard funk with a touch of goat. The citrus is very lemony. Little to no phenolics. 
Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a nice white head with good retention. 
Flavor is very lemony and refreshing with less Brett funk than the aroma had. Nice assertive bitterness and hard water make more a nice palate cleansing finish. Low phenolics in flavor as well. 
Mouthfeel is crisp and finishes dry. Not thin at all. Alcohol warmth is moderate but present without effecting aroma or flavor. No astringency. Moderately high carbonation. 
Overall this is a really nice saison and a great addition to the Sante Adairius portfolio.

2871,"2012-10-23",4.0,"On draft at the tasting room. It pours orange/golden with a small white head. The aroma has some sweet fruit candy, lemon, tropical notes, light hay and funk. The flavor has light lemon, pineapple, a little brett phenolics and pepper near the finish. Theres also some cracker like maltiness in the middle. Not very spicy or peppery. Refreshing.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
2871,"2012-07-28",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2015 Batch 1: Pours an unclear straw color with a fine white head. Aromas of fresh pale malt. Smells like a brewhouse, in a good way. Light accents of citrus with subtle musty brett notes. Dry crisp malts, straw, grass, mild summer fruit. This is exactly what you want on a hot day. A complete departure from all those flabby sweet American ""saisons."" A really solid beer in the DuPont vein.
  
Batch 2: Pours a tangerine/pumpkin hue with a bright white head. Pronounced tartness in the aroma; lemon and kumquat, some banana. Flavor is less fruity and more bretty at this stage, with a solid funk: cheesecloth, straw, soft phenols. Citric acidity, banana pith, smooth tartness, bone-dry finish with lingering lemony aftertaste.
  
Batch 3: Pours an orange-gold color with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma is fresh grains and wort, with a touch of unripe banana and stone fruit. Flavor has a great lemony tartness throughout, teetering on the verge of sourness at times but never crossing over. Mild pale malts are barely there; this is a total yeast showcase. Secondary accents of peach pit and citrus zest. The brett is there, but not in force quite yet, due to the young age of this batch. I still get that lovely brett attenuation mouthfeel, with a pleasant dryness and maybe an occasional wisp of dusty musty funk.

Batch 4: On tap at the brewery. Peachy gold color with a white head. Big tartness on the aroma, sourish clementine notes, banana. Fresh grains, bananas and lemons, bretty chalky finish with a bit of lemon verbena. Dry and a little musty, the brett has yet to take hold. Similar to batch 3. 
 
Batch 4, again: Different keg than my last entry and actually rather different in taste. This time I get unmistakable apricot fruitiness all over the aroma and flavor, plus more significant tartness. Every time I have this beer I realize that this is what a saison ought to be. Brett, lacto, stone fruit, yogurt, dry and tart. 

Batch 5: From bottle. This batch is distinctly more blood orangey to me, but not at the expense of the nice dried apricot of the last release. Also, at only a couple months old, this beer is significantly tart, pretty sublime . This was a big hit at Ratebeer Gallery III among those I shared with. 
  
Batch 7: On tap at the brewery. Huge sour blood orange, Meyer lemon and apricot, and now Im picking up dried cherries for the first time. The midpalate complexity is huge but it resolves into such a pleasant dry simplicity. Ludicrous beer.
 
Batch 9: On tap at the brewery. Meyer lemon and apricot nose, macerated fruit in lemon juice. Flavor blends those notes back into the Brett-forward profile that I love out of young Bernice, giving a balanced beer more recognizable as a ""saison"" than the ""sour ale"" gestalt of an aged bottle for instance. 

Batch 9, again, from bottle at the brewery. Bretty apricot mimosa explosion. This is everything.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
