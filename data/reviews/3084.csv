3084,"2017-03-03",4.2,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, liquorice, chocolate, molasses, mocha, roasted malts and coffee.

Appearance:

Opaque black beer with a large dark brown head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, liquorice chocolate, molasses and mocha; ends slightly/medium bitter and dry with roasted malts and coffee.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Would not say this is a Smoked; it feels much more like a smoked Imperial Stout. It feels like its always there, but never quite reaches the surface. The roasted malts are up there aplenty however. The aroma could have been stronger and the palate thicker though, but otherwise this beer is amazing.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Head is initially average sized, frothy, brown, mostly lasting.

Medium to full body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Great appearance (first pour opacity and a lasting head is an easy 5), and a fairly nice (if somewhat simple) nose get things off on the right foot, even if thereÂ’s virtually no smoke.

3084,"2015-05-10",4.0,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped 03445 but it is smudged. An attractive dark brown pour under a soft, silky, tan head. The aroma has an array of interesting characteristics including chocolate, dark roasted malts, a touch of smoke, cellar, and earth. No booze at 10%. Everything mingles well together. Medium to better than medium body but smooth and delicate. The taste is a slight letdown I have to say. Yes, I get the dark malt sweetness and a light to moderate bitterness to finish. There is no booze ion the flavor. But everything seemed downplayed. I wanted the flavor to be more boisterous. Still a solid 4 out 5.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

3084,"2015-04-23",4.2,"4 pack from LittleÂ’s. I wasnÂ’t expecting this stout to be so huge, but this is a massive beer. The pour reveals a very, very dark, inky body with a dark tan head. The aroma is boldly malty, but I wish there were more smoke. Seems like they used a very light hand with the smoked wheat malt. I get rum, dark cherries, espresso crema, leather, molasses, cacao, earth. I just had a feeling the use of smoke was going to be timid on this one, so IÂ’m not holding that against the beer.Besides the fact, this beer is amazingly delicious. The palate is huge. Loads of malty goodness wash over my taste buds. Strong espresso and dark chocolate are noted with rum, wood and earth. The finish finally brings out the smoke, and itÂ’s not terribly faint either. It lingers and rounds out the meaty and hearty flavor. . I wouldnÂ’t categorize this as a smoked beer, but this is a delightful imperial stout.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

3084,"2015-02-22",4.3,"Bottle from the Beer shop at Grand Central, New York. Bottle is super cool - modern but not trendy.

Pours a deep dark black with a small head - standard looking dark moody imperial stout. 

Smells rich, treacly, not overly complex (though definitely not insubstantial or boozy. 

ItÂ’s not a complicated beast, there isnÂ’t chocolate or licorice, the wheat is barely discernible, and the smokiness is subtle.

What it is though, is deliciously drinkable. It is superbly balanced, the booze is there but not too prominent (it tastes, 7 or 8% but is actually 10), the sweetness and bitterness are both well pronounced, and it has a wonderfully full and velvety mouthfeel.

In short, this isnÂ’t the most original beer out there, despite the wheat, smokiness and excellent packaging. It is however, one of the best imperial stouts out there in my opinion. Not quite a Sierra Nevada Narwhal, but not a million miles away.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","nickbannister"
