639,"2017-05-31",3.5,"Alkohol:  7,5% obj. 
 Kolor:  Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Beżowa, drobnoziarnista, umiarkowana.
Wygląda trochę jak pianka na cappuccino. Nie jest zbyt okazała, szybko redukuje się do nikłej obrączki, która pozostaje na cały czas degustacji.
Niewiele pajęczynek na ściankach szkła. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest bardzo skromny. W pierwszej chwili dociera do nosa lekka paloność, odrobina ciemnych słodów, czekolada mleczna i kawa rozpuszczalna.
Troszeczkę z tyłu przypieczona skórka od chleba i odrobina karmelu. 
 Smak:  Piwo otrzymałem w wyniku wymiany piwnej. Trudno określić datę butelki, bo nigdzie jej nie ma;( Obstawiam po profilu piwa, że trochę przeleżakowało.
Leżakowanie spowodowało, że zatracił się mleczny profil piwa.
Jest sporo nut kawy, gorzkiej czekolady, dość wysoka paloność. Pojawia się też śliskość na języku i kremowe odczucie w ustach. Brakuje tej najważniejszej cechy, czyli mlecznej słodyczy.
Pojawia się odrobina orzechów włoskich i karmelu. Struktura jest umiarkowana, gładkie na języku.
Lekkie, umiarkowanie pijalne, niskowysycone. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:   

Taki sobie mleczny stout. 
Tak jak wcześniej zaznaczyłem leżakowanie odebrało mu mleczną słodycz, 
a spowodowało, że stało się bardziej palone, wytrawne. Aromat także stracił bardzo na sile. 
Osobiście jestem fanem słodkich, mocno mlecznych Milk Stoutów. 
Niemniej jednak piwo jest gładkie i kremowe na języku.
Niskie wysycenie ułatwia jego konsumpcje.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Appearance: Black with a head that fizzes away quickly and loudly -- sounds like pop. All that remains is what looks like black water with only a few carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom.

Smell: Hm. Nice. Roasty for sure, but sweetness that creates a bit of a caramel, milk chocolate, and vanilla character. A sweet smelling roast is the primary smell, with the other notes being a bit underlied.

Taste/feel: Definitely a solid beer. Doesnt strike me as being too much different than One Oatmeal stout, just that this one has a bit more ""oomph"", and a less mouthfeel.. they really are both quite similar beers. The carbonation is pretty mild, but prickly, on this beer, and the texture is a bit thin. The flavor is unlike the smell, as its just a lot of coffee flavored roastiness, with a subtle vanilla sweetness. As it warms, more sweetness comes through along with... dark fruits? It seems out of place in a cream stout. I do like that it adds another dimension, but its not what I look for in the style.

A very good cream stout, but not the best Ive had. It looks ugly in the glass, but it has a pleasing aroma, and a pretty good flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit of a bummer, but Too remains enjoyable regardless. I prefer One to Too just because it is a bit more drinkable, with a nicer feel on it.

Massive in the mouth. Rich roast and burnt retronasasls, some odd cherry stone aspects. Sticky fullness, in the palate, burnt acidity, carbonation relatively soft. Has a potency to it, but dowesnt say boozy. And its massively burnt, leaving a dry mouth, but without the biting astringency you sometimes get.

A: Pours a very dark brown color. The head is a three finger tan shade. Retention isnt particularly superb, nor did I expect it to be. Lacing isnt great, either. Still, the look of this one puts most imperial stouts to shame.

S: Certainly a cream stout, with its big notes of lactose and powdered chocolate. Underlying that is some roasted barley. Smells bigger than it really is.

T: An initial wave of opening lactic cream is really pleasant, giving way to a combination of unsweetened chocolate and roasted barley. The aforementioned finish retains its milky twang, helping to balance all of the pleasant roasty bitterness. Im also happy the lactose doesnt come off as being too acidic. This is my kind of stout, only lacking in terms of depth.

M: Creamy and soft, giving way to a semi-dry finish. It does a solid job being moderately easy to drink and feeling big at the same time. Generally, it just FEELS pitch-black.

O: While it definitely comes off like a cream stout, there are many times drinking this where I think it might be an imperial stout, and a rock-solid one at that. Certainly its much better than their One oatmeal stout.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Excellent mouth on this one. Big chewy feel with a smooth coating effect. Excellent for this style. I wish all stouts would take note and do the same.

Pours a solid black color, even a vigorous pour could not coax much of the tan head out of hiding. Smells of roasted malts, huge amounts of coffee and ash on the nose. Sweet lactose burnt sugar, dark caramel in there as well. Taste is what I expected. Hugely roasted malts with burnt coffee, ash, and a lactose sweetness that barely balances any of the roast. Wow this is the most ""burnt"" brew I think Ive ever tasted. Reminds me of that coffee pot that got left on the burner empty for too long. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, thick body, light level of carbonation. Kudos to Dark Horse for pushing the burnt boundary.

639,"2011-02-26",3.1,"Pours black with a small tan head. Almost no head to be honest, I had to force it. Leaves a nice film of bubbles when you swirl it around the glass slowly.
Coffee, malty, and a bit of chocolate. Some slight hint of vanilla. Dark fruits, but not strong in them. There is something a bit off as well. Its not a bad thing, just doesnt seem like it belongs. Kind of like a slight sourness, like a wood aged beer. But I have to search it out and it doesnt detract from the overall experience.
Diluted roasted malt. Slight sweetness with a big bitterness on the back end. Some coffee, but mostly the tannins making it bitter. Strange for a cream stout.
Slightly creaminess that is soon overshadowed by the bitterness that bites hard and sticks around. Not very cream stout like.
Fairly drinkable minus the shortcomings. I would try it again. But when I want a cream stout I will pass this one up. More of an American style dry stout.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

Man - I do not dig the aroma - its very strong, reminds me of burnt milk and something metallic with underlying chocolate. That chocolate is quite dark and grows with warmth but, still, not my thing. The taste is much better but pretty much has the same characteristics of the aroma just in a backwards order. Lactose, dark roasted malts, tons and tons of medium powered chocolate, nutty, sweet and a pleasant bitterness. Really good! Dont think more than a pint would be good for me though. Soft carbonation and the bitterness leave a neat feel and very light tartness. I dont get a thick coating left over because the perfect kind of bitterness wipes it away somehow. No notice of the alcohol. Excellent dark milky chocolate aftertaste. I think I went wrong here by dumping in a good chunk of the sediment because it was just so harsh for the first while.

The carbonation is mild w/ small, beady bubbles that roll across your tongue and finishes w/ a mild roasty bitterness in the finish.

639,"2009-12-24",3.7,"Been waiting awhile to pop the top on this one, so early on Christmas eve...about to get the cooking started I decided to start it off right.  The beer pours out a jet black body with coffee-brown edges and nearly no head.  Just an oil-slick formation of head particles clumping together.  Tiny sparkling bubbles gather around the rim, but other than than its zippo.

The aroma has coffee notes, black strap molasses, vanilla extract and chocolate covered caramel candy.  Very tame though even with all the aromas getting flung around.  It really didnt leap out of the glass as some stouts can.

Flavor has a very smooth roasted coffee/dark chocolate combo.  Vanilla creeps into the flavor when it hits its stride, a touch of smoke, and soy sauce notes too.  Seemed slightly salty somehow too, and the roasted malt bitterness goes a long way with this beer.

The coating effect on the glass is nice, although it doesnt cling as long like some can.  Smooth and supple on the mouth.  Nothing harsh or over-bearing.  The sweetness really seems to be held in check for a sweet stout, which was welcome.  Some can really get out-of-hand with the lactose.

Pours a nice dark blackish hue with brown and red around the edges. Decent brownish head that dissipates to a small amount, laces well. Largely opaque, with a possible exception being the edges. Aromas are a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, creamy sweetness, roasted malts which are a little subdued by the sweetness. Initial has a medium body, moving quickly to bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and lighter roasted malts. Some caramel, dessert-y sweetness, lactose, and roasted flavors come through fuller in the body. Still a bit light on flavor / a touch watery for the ABV. Sustained aftertaste, and a less powerful palate palate sticker. Light bitterness on the finish helps to balance, keeping this far from being cloying especially coupled with some decent roast. Not bad at all. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Aroma is very complex right from the start, with scents of smoke, coffee, vanilla, beef jerky, cherry skin, light soy, and considerable roasted malt that really comes together to form a pleasant scent.  The great complexity displayed by the aroma does not quite carry over into the taste, but its still nice enough.  Theres a unique competition between the low-key sweetness of the milk sugar, and the strong roasted/smoky characters of the malt.  The roasted character wins out in the end and produces a green snap pea pod flavor towards the finish with a hint of graham cracker showing up later on.

The initial aroma was very nice with a lot of bitter chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee. It reminded me of an oatmeal stout. However as this beer sat it lost a lot of its aromas. After a while it only smelled like faint roasted malts. The taste consisted of a lot of bitter chocolate and coffee with roasted malts in the background. Finished a bit bitter.

The aroma is very roasty with hints of a tangy darker fruit. Cocoa notes are quite prevalent along with the also noticeable coffee. Smooth lactose notes are very, very subtle. The brew is somewhat light on the tongue but provides some nice smooth creaminess. The initial flavour is very milky with hints of a light pomegranate tanginess. As the brew proceeds to pass the tongue, tanginess bursts a little before a nice blast of chocolate mixes perfectly with the milky qualities.

I get highly roasted to burnt malts along with chocolate, coffee and sweet molasses. Smells great. The flavor enters with some smoothness and starts with a black licorice note then vanilla and burnt malts. It then moves into coffee, chocolate and more burnt malts. Everything goes together nicely.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

639,"2008-06-26",4.1,"Poured dark brown with ruby highlights and a large fizzy/frothy brown head.  Rich sweet aroma of chocolate, dark fruit, a bit of alcohol, some light bitter coffee.  Flavor follows with notes of roasted coffee beans, some 60% cacao bitter chocolate, a bit of vinous fruits, some dry alcohol.  Im impressed how this beer balances sweetness and bitter roastiness.  At first I thought they traded off, with sweetness coming first and bitterness following, but as I went though the glass I felt more that they somehow worked side-by-side, the virtual ideal for a milk stout.  Mouth feel is sufficiently creamy for the style.  Overall I was very impressed by beer which finally penetrated my select group of favorite stouts that are not brewed Bells.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

A small ring of brown foam gathers at the rim, producing sudsy, sugary legs that slowly drip back down into the body.  The nose is as advertised, with big, roasty notes of bakers chocolate and espresso.  Sweetness comes through in the form of lactic sugars, providing nice contrast to the staunch roast.  Flavors mimic this pattern exactly, with creamy lactose showing atop bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, and scorched caramel.  Substantial and creamy in the mouth, this one goes down silky smooth, leaving lingering espresso on the rear of the tongue.  Im not a big sweet stout guy, but this one is impressive.

639,"2008-01-18",3.7,"Inky black pour with no transparency retains only a thread of brown foam around the rim.  Aroma is all thick, rustic roasted malt; firm and beefy like meat fresh from the coals.  Wisps of wild rice, tart red apple, chocolate hazelnuts, and cinnamon gather up in the bonfire smoke.  Flavor brings it a little weakly with a hollow tone, but warms up quickly into a varied but predictable set of tastes.  These are fairly needly and woodsy, like black licorice, brown sugar, molasses and holly leaves lingering in the wet soil.  Lactic flavors are very quiet, which if not exercised toward something purposefully soured tend to work counterintuitively in a rich, roasty stout, so this is a pleasant quality.  With warmth, oatmeal cookie dough, caramel, and toffee provide a soft touch of sweetness to balance the bitter, vegetal coffee and earth tones of roasted malt.  Slight citrus hop and red berry interludes here and there.  Medium to full palate is creamy and soft, with a lot of lively fruit and winey dimensions.

639,"2007-12-17",4.0,"12 oz. bottle, no bottling/freshness date, but I know this is the new label 2007 release, sampled in a pint glass. The ABV is 8%.

Poured as black as motor oil with a tight, compact brown head that slowly settled into a thin sudsy lacing. A light amount of splotchy lace at the top of the glass.

Lush smelling nose of heavily roasted dark malts and milk sugar. The smells really mesh together well, roasted dark coffee, lightly burnt chocolate and sweet milky lactose, quite appealing.

There is enough of an low temperature warmth to make its 8% ABV noticeable on the tongue and in back of the mouth. Smooth moderate feeling body with an airy creaminess, this is one easy sipper, quite pleasant on a cold mid-December night. The milk sugar lactose flavor does a lot to sweeten the roasted, almost burnt, dark malts, easing their nature malty bitterness. Dark roast coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate buoyed by the sugary milk flavor make this cream stout unique and highly enjoyable. In the aftertaste some coffee nuttiness lingers a bit in the palate.

639,"2007-12-01",3.7,"Pours jet black with a small, creamy, brown head that diminishes to a thin ring of bubbles clinging to the edge of the glass. After a couple minutes it looks like a pint glass full of soy sauce. The nose is a subdued blend of dark roasted malt and light chocolate. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and fairly thin yet silky soft, transitioning into a roasted, sour finish. Roasted dark and chocolate malt are complimented by a solid sweet-sour lactose note. The lactose, however, is a bit too much for my tastes. While I like this one, I enjoyed Dark Horses ""One"" a lot more.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

The flavor was roasty, coffee, hops, a waxy/bitterness at the back of the mouth, and some molasses.  The flavor was not as complex as I would have like, but still good.

Aroma is coffee roast, liquorish, and dark chocolate.  Pretty nice.  The flavor is initially sweeter and smooth; chocolaty. The roast and coffee notes appear in the finish.  The aftertaste is milky - the lactose.  The body is pretty smooth, but a little on the thin side.  I guess that is the difference between using oats for sweetness and using lactose.  I have to say I enjoy the body produced by using oats, but this lactose flavor is very nice.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"

Alcohol is faintly present in the nose.  Flavor is fairly spicy... I mean in addition to all of the junk you would expect from a sweet stout.  The licorice flavoring came out much stronger than in earlier samples Ive had of this.  I dont know if it is because I finally got around to rating the sixth bottle out of a six pack and it had been in the fridge for a while, or whether it was something I hadnt detected before...

Flavor is much more roasty and ashy than anticipated, though after a few more swallows the lactose makes itself a little more apparent.

Body is medium, texture is very creamy and smooth, very soft carbonation. Finish was a pleasantly long. What a great beer!!!  I will definitely add this to my favorite rotation of beer.

Its got a nice full flavor, with somewhat less chocolate, a tad of chicory even, and a heavy bready finish. Very, very dry, which I find quite enjoyable. Id like a bit more thickness in the body, given that this is a sweet stout, as I feel that the basic qualities would benefit from this.

639,"2007-06-26",4.2,"Pours an inky black body, fairly impervious to light, under a small, oiled-leather head that settles quickly to a thick halo. Thick, dark chocolate aroma (at least 65% cacao) with the additional smooth sweetness of chocolate ice cream. Raisin, coffee roasts, cherries and light charred notes each join in from time to time. Thick, rich palate... nice and heavy with just a hint of carbonation creeping in at the end so as not to choke you. Flavor is of a high-quality chocolate covered cherry. Very few suggestions of the 8%. Roastiness joins a sweet finish for a bittersweet balance. A ton of aroma, a ton of flavor... ""too"" tons of fun.

639,"2007-05-15",3.6,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Purchased at Rileys Wines of the World in Madison, WI.  Sampled immediately after One.  Pours a dark black, completely opaque color with a thin layer of quickly dissipating filmy toasted marshmellow head.  A gentle swirl sends a myriad of fine bubbles shimmering to the surface.  Very rich dark malt base thats dripping with loads of chocolates and coffee.  Some softer, fruitier notes of raisins and charred molasses add some richness.  Similar minty hop and coffee/chocolate character as with One, but the molasses chracter and softly sweet smoke are what really differentiate Too.  Medium light mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation.  Definitely needs more carbonation to help lighten up the palate some and add the namesake creaminess.  Flavors are a bit less impressive than the nose, but are solid none-the-less.  Chocolates and coffees abound up front, but these give way to some juicy dark prune and chocolate syrup.  A bit of very subtle smokey and tobacco-ish characters linger on the back-end.  Flavors are a bit less interesting to me than with the One.  Well constructed overall, with no real off traits other than the light carbonation, which isnt severe.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Mouthfeel was velvety smooth and flowed like Willie Wonkas chocolate river all over my taste buds!  Rich roasty flavors of cocoa and coffee w/heavy cream were savored with each sip.

639,"2007-04-01",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2012 12 oz bottle courtesy of MI2CA.  Poured into a small tulip glass with small brown head. Again the blackest color. Aroma is soft roastiness, emphasis on soft.  I get lactose but more like spoiled cider and a prune juice aspect.  Mouthfeel is undercarbonated which adds to the prune juice similarity. Taste is just slightly spoiled milk, weird fruitiness (did I say prune enough), and finishes with slight coffee bitterness, which stays for the aftertaste.  The hinting coffee leaves me wanting more, the undercarbonation is not too desirable and this beer is my first disappointment of the 4 stout beers (maybe my expectations were too high).
I am thinking the original rating was an off bottle.  Bought this at a store in North Chicago.  Poured completely black with a dark brown, large head.  Still looks good.  The bottom line on this beer is its all bitter malt, not a sweet stout at all.  I feel like I am smelling burning stove and drinking bitter black patent husk. Too one dimensional.

This beer has a surprisingly light nose, but is chock full of beefy roastiness, fresh-brewed coffee, bittersweet caramel and chocolate. A very balanced and standout aroma. Upon first sip, all I can conjure up is ""Dark Horse is such a fun brewery, good beer too."" Nice heavy roastiness sets in soon thereafter. Also adorning my tastebuds with their respective flavors are light smokiness, chocolate, caramel, coffee, cookie. The palate is a little thinner than Id like, medium-light to medium, moderately bitter. The best part is yet to come: an amazingly delicious chocolate chip cookie finish, just like a liqueur produced from fine exotic ingredients. A winner from Dark Horse.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

I got this in a recent trade with artusory.  It was very well made.  If only there was not a neverending supply of new beers to try, I would pick this one up if it ever made it to Madison.  As it is, I can highly recommend it if you find it while in Michigan.
Aroma / Appearance - It pours a dark plum color that behaves like an oily liquid.  The lacing clings to the side of the glass before sliding down to rejoin the rest.  The nose is an intruiging combination of burnt toast, smores, plums, blueberries and cedar chips.  In the background is a hint of chocolate (the cheap waxy candy bar type).
Flavor / Palate - Sweet chocolate chips, roasted malts, smoke and raisins present themselves from the start.  After that comes a chalky chocolate mouthfeel that is a little thin but still pleasing.  The aftertaste is malty and slightly bitter.  This is very easy to drink and was gone before I knew it.  While not extremely complex, it still is good enough to warrant a recommendation if you can find it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma is fantastic - lots of roast and cocoa, some fresh coffee, a touch of sour cherry, and an interesting smoky & salty end note. Body is a bit thin, but nice, giving it an almost cask-like character.

639,"2005-12-06",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2005 2004 bottle from Crosling, thanks so much Nick, this kicked ass!  Consumed on 12/4/05.Pours a deeply opaque, black as night colored body with a seriously burnt tan-coal colored head that I manage to get about a cover out of before it quickly runs for the edges and then nothing.You know, normally this would elicit about a 2 out of me for appearance, but is the appearance in a stout so important?? No, not really.  Here it just signifies that it is nearly flat, and that is not a bad thing, I certainly dont care for highly carbonated beers.  If it was a pilsner or something similar, than appearance and carbonation are a little more indicative of quality, to some extent, but not here.  Not to mention, I just know this would be a 4 or 5 for appearance when fresh.Moving on.  The aroma pleasures the nostrils with thick, rich vanilla beans, creamy milk chocolate, light hazelnut-chocolate spread and thick barley notes.  Light, drying yeast is noted as well.  What it is light on is the roast and hops, which is fine with me, and a welcomed departure from your more traditional stout.  But the vanilla, chocolate, light bitter black chocolate and thick cocoa and dry yeast is well pronounced and soothing.  The flavor continues with the chocolate, though it is less bitter and black and more like a sweet honeyish-chocolate mixed in with vanilla iced cream.  Succulent and well-placed lightly dry barley grain notes on the sides of the palate, adding balance and a light touch of coffee as it warms, sort of a grainy mocha or coffee-bean touch.  The texture is fluid, immensely velvety and soothing, very near flat, but not thin or watery, importantly.  The liquid glides down the throat leaving a pleasant sensation of light bitterness, sweet vanilla and brown malts lingering on the back of the throat.  No alcohol apparency whatsoever.  Medium body and very drinkable.At 8 abv, this is nowhere near overdone, overhopped, syrupy, overly bitter, that sort of thing and that factors much in my score.  Highly flavorful without being overdone.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
639,"2005-12-05",4.0,"Thick, oozing black pour and undeniably opaque.  Precious few dust speckles on the surface, but otherwise, darkness prevails.  Aroma is so fin good.  Singed hazelnuts, bitter espresso sludge, piney tar grooves, dark unsweetened chocolate bricks and muddy, trampled clay hiking trails.  Flavor is lighter faring than expected, but tasty in its own right, settling in with cocoa powder and Irish cream flavored coffee grinds.  Roastiness pursues post sip, somewhat enigmatic to the superfluous cafe motif.  Juxtaposition of dry buttercream and whipped chocolate torte fluff aid in the full circle, medium bodied display, which is synchronistical creamy and dry.  Not a heavy hitter, but tasty by all means.  At times - and most prevalent in the finish - we get an airy forkload of tiramisu, ringing with a layer of coffee grinds and trailing long after the sun sets (which has long deserted us in Wisconsin by this time of year.)

Texture was very creamy, just enough carbonation.  finished bitter with chocolate, although on a few sips i swear it tasted like lettuce.  Good choice for a cold winter night.","Oregon, USA","Fearless99"

Roasted malts, raisins/prunes, some alcohol all coming through in the nose.  Taste is much the same with some sweetness as well as a slightly bitter chocolate finish.

Espresso and chocolate aromas, with hints of vanilla, roast and brownies, quite the vibrant little blend of malt aromatics.  Flavor has some oxidation, just like the aroma, but this is also a 2004 example.  Body is slightly undercarbonated and it is thin, but not watery.  Slightly bitter and astringent malt, but still decadent and enjoyable, with chocolate and cream flavors.  Quite the treat.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

639,"2005-09-27",3.3,"Extremely dark black. Chocolaty-sweet nose. Rich, intense, dark chocolate flavors. Silky-soft texture was real nice, but it was a little lacking in the carbonation department. Sweet notes of creamy milk, cocoa and caramel. Background aromas of smoke and tobacco. Overall: Great aromas; OK flavors; questionable texture. Oh, and I wasnt fond of the multi-phallic label, for what thats worth. What is that a drawing of anyway?","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Starts out ok in the nose, but falls down a bit in the mouth...not much body or texture, and kind of tart.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

639,"2005-08-27",3.2,"Bottle pours an extremely dark black with only a suggestion of a light brown head. Aorma is roasted and a bit of molassas and slightly sour.  More like a very strong porter.  Flavor is similar.  Dark roasted notes and a little chocolate but mainly that burnt, charcoal flavor.  Again I thought rather porter-ish.  A rather thin fell as well. The late aftertaste is a quite strong smokey bitter.  I expected more ""sweet"" or ""cream"" in this one.
Nice but a bit over rated I thought.

639,"2005-06-24",3.8,"A contrast to the One Oatmeal Stout that we just opened... this one is thicker, looking (and smelling) like motor oil, with a firm dark brown, almost caramel colored head on top.  Nose is full of fuesel-like alcohol, blackened shoe polish and oil, caramel chews and some scotch.  Quite weird, I guess.  Up front its silky smooth, but turns to a caustic and abrasive prickliness over the back of the tongue... chalky residue covers the mouth afterwards, which isnt entirely pleasent.  Black smoke is what I think of when the flavors hit me... some butterscotch and white bread (grains?) as well.  An interesting beer, but head-to-head the One Oatmeal Stout wins easily.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Straight up burnt citrus fruit bitterness flavors kick it off on the first sip, followed up quickly by a light smokiness.

Poured so dark and so thick, it was the proverbial molasses in winter. The head was tight and DARK brown. The aroma was roasted malts, and chocolate.  The carbonation was only enough to add to the flavors, that were, again, thick ass hell man. This is sweet and yummy. Bitter chocolate and coffee and all creamy, this was excellent.

Thick fell that gets thinned out by something a bit acerbic. Wish the flavors matched better with the aromas. Thinner flavors of coffee, with a thin raspberry syrup, mild sourdough and dark rye bread. Really mellow as it warms.

Awesome flavors of columbian coffee, roast, smoke, burnt notes, dark chocolate, plum, rum.  Pure stout bliss!  This could be the most under-rated beer on rate beer.  TO me, this is a top 50 all the way!  Long roasty, smokey chocolate finish what was delivered with a nice oily palate.  The carbonation was perfect for this style.  has that slight marshmellow finish mouthfeal like Kalamazoo bells stout.  As the beer warmed, the beer exibited a nice rum/cherry flavor and the maple was more apparent on the aroma.  I think i had a religions experience with this beer.  Michigan is the KING of stouts.

It pours motor oil black with a small brown head that diminishes to a thin ring along the outside edges of the glass.  The flavor stats with a light quick dose of dark chocolate that quickly fades to a roasted coffee finish with some light burnt notes.  Absolutely no sign of the 8%.

Excellent Stout.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
639,"2004-07-14",3.8,"Stark black, opaque and thick set, no head, a few dark brown bubbles urge up around the edge, lace is nil as well. Aroma has a mild tone and overall low-keyed nose, has a good portion of vanilla, hazelnut, sweet chocolate, and caramel, has a thin roasty hint along with some kind of undetermined fruityness. Taste has a balancing act between mild roast qualities and sweet malts and fruits. The fruit seems like pear and slight orange which sits mostly underneath a moderate bittering black malt astringency, coffeeness, and burnt barley. The flavors are quite nice, not overly intense or brutish, it favors more of a smooth, rich smoothability and drinkability. Where as the feel and body goes, so goes the drinkability with this stuff. Sweet creamy body and bulky rich feel, slick and buttery, bold and slides right down. Finish is a partial mix of cocoa and roasty drying and tidbits of the sweeter stuff sticking.
Dark Horse seems to have their brews solidly built, as I have yet to be diappointed by one yet. The stouts are all top notch treats. As is this.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

A motor oil body propped up a dark brown head of small bubbles, but its a shame that the head was MIA after only a few seconds.  Dark chocolate aroma with malts thrown in for good measure.

Aroma hints of roasted chocolate and dark malts, molasses, espresso, hazelnut, light aromatic hops, and dusty yeast esters. Wow, a big rush of bittersweet chocolate and a solid counter of lactic sourness (the big difference between cream and oatmeal stouts) and smokey twang. The coffee and nutty characteristics come out and play more upon the finish. The mouthfeel is lush without becoming sticky, enough carbonation without becoming flat and boring. Yes it's a sweet stout but it bring so many more ""things"" to the palate than most, almost an equal to Bells Double Cream IMO, recommended for all stouties!

639,"2003-06-24",3.9,"I hadn't sipped a Dark Horse brew since my days at Albion College, which is ten minutes from this small Marshall brewery.  I was very happy to find several recently arrived Dark Horse varieties at a nice beer/liquor establishment in Grand Rapids, most of which I have not tasted.  But enough of my reminiscing.  This is a solid, unique stout.  The very dark brown body is topped with a dark tan/light brown lasting head.  The aroma had me guessing, but I can see how it can be termed anise-like.  Definitely a strong roasted, almost smoked aspect as well (ratebeer is giving me a new positive opinion of sentence fragments).  Flavor is sweet as per style, but strong roasted, licorice, and chocolate flavors compete for attention.  The flavors do tend to compete, rather than interact, and a slightly stronger hops component would serve to balance the flavor.  Still, this Dark Horse brew manages to step outside the halls of convention, reminding me why I continue to explore the world of ale.  Recommended to fans of Arcadia's Imperial Stout.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

639,"2002-11-14",3.7,"Also known as One in the trio of Dark Horse stouts.  This one and the oatmeal variety look remarkably similar - deep brown with a quick scattering tan head.  This one gets the nod for nose and flavour, with an interesting licorice accompaniment to the harder roasts and bitters.  But its best to mix the two.  Im serious!  I had the two pints poured simultaneously and when each got down to a third of a glass or so I whimsically mixed them.  The result deepened the full round sweet flavours and allowed them to better battle the bitters.  The mixture reminded me of some of the better Imperials for complexity.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
