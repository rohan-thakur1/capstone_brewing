1699,"2017-06-10",3.8,"Biscuit, banana, clove, doughy and bubblegum aromas. Slightly tart. The carbonation is spot on, fizzy and light. A well done hefe.","Pocasset, Massachusetts, USA","growler6"
1699,"2017-02-22",3.8,"Bottle. Pours lightly-hazy, thin yellow with a no head whatsoever (poured aggressively) and no lacing. Aroma of clove and banana, flavor follows nose with the addition of doughy bread, light body, clean, almost dry light body, lightly sweet, fine/soft carbo leading to a very lightly bitter and lightly sweet brief finish. Very clean nice on a hot summer day.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","Handypaul"
1699,"2016-11-02",3.0,"An decent hefeweizen overall. Pours an ugly yellow. Smells very good, lots of lemon and herbs. Taste is a little watery though, but has some lemon and melon in it. Paired with strawberry Brie salad, brings out some sweetness and strawberry. Had in the bottle.

1699,"2016-09-06",3.1,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2017 On tap at brewery. Pours pale yellow with a small, quickly dissipating white head. Strong aroma of wheat with notes of clove. Watery taste of banana with some wheat, malt, and bread. Finishes quickly. Light-medium body. Average carbonation. Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"
1699,"2016-08-13",3.5,"Pours a straw yellow color with a white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of banana, clove, and wheat. Flavorful beer with banana, citrus, clove, and some wheat. Very nice beer.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","alobar"
1699,"2016-05-24",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
This perfectly authentic Hefeweizen showcases banana bread segueing into a touch of citrus and chewy wheat before a delicate splash of pepper and cloves seals the finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam diminishes atop the cloudy whitish blond.
-Carbonation is high enough to offset the generous wheat presence.
-All flavors are nicely balanced.
-Texture is textbook Hefe: rich and creamy for a quencher, yet drinkability remains very high because of the light acidity and high effervescence.
-This is as good as some of the best Bavarian examples. Quite a wonderful surprise!

1699,"2016-05-22",3.6,"Tap at brewery with commonmac and rosskyle and samadouche. Hazy white gold with small white head. Clean citrus funk, banana, spice. Medium body. Typical hefe, but well done.","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
1699,"2016-02-14",3.2,"Tap at Queen City Brewery, Burlington. Colour is clear golden with small white head. Aromas and flavours: Fruits, some banana, wheat, sweetness and malts. Nothing special really.","Oulu/Helsinki, FINLAND","VastActiv"
1699,"2016-01-28",3.6,"Pours a slightly hazed gold into a weizen. Bright white head with little retention recedes to mottle surface. Dried banana and aspirin aromas. Soft with sweet banana and cream upfront turning to mild earth before the lasting banana bread finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
1699,"2016-01-09",3.4,"Bottle from Acton
Mostly clear light golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Spicy wheat and a hint of fruit and earth with a touch of clove on the nose. Sweet bready maltiness with hints of light stone fruit. Light banana and clove with bits of earthy spicy yeasty flavor. Medium body with a light level of carbonation.  Its really clear, even with a swirl of the bottle to touch up my glass, it should be cloudy with yeast. The carbonation is really light in my bottle, and maybe a bit of carbonic bite would help add a bit of tart to cut through the somewhat sweet character of this beer. Its a clean well made beer, but needs a few tweaks to really stand out.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
1699,"2015-12-02",4.3,"Smell is divine of sweetly and banana. Color not very pleasant a very light yellow almost clearish color. I believe a good hefeweizen should be a darker yellow color and cloudy. Taste on the other hands is divine with a nice light crisp wheat malti flavor followed by a tropical banana smoothed with nice carbonation. The sweet sweet flavor lingers on the tongue along with all the other great flavors on the perfect balance just long enough. Vermont Queen City keep it coming","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"
1699,"2015-08-28",3.3,"Taster at the source. Pours pale yellow gold with a big white head. Aroma is honey, wet sock, pepper. Flavor Is honey, banana, a bit of clove the finish.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
1699,"2015-07-18",4.0,"This was poured into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a hazy golden burnt yellow color with a soft white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving some sliding stringy lacing.
The smell started off with banana esters weaving inside of some spicy clove. Light bubblegum balances nicely.
The taste copied the smell and carried a nice settling sweet to spicy aftertaste leading to a wet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice spicy to sweet sessionable feel all around.
Overall, as a hefeweizen, its true to style, hits all of the marks and makes a fantastic Summer session.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
1699,"2015-06-15",3.5,"draft in burlington, no need to go all crazy over this, its just a regular hefeweizen. Banana and cloves. Drinkable and finishes on wheat. Nothing spectacular and not as complex as the germans.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1699,"2015-06-03",4.2,"Squealer from Joes. Cloudy orange amber with lasting head and some lace. Beautiful banana clove aroma. Mild-medium sweetness peachy fruit with wheaty tang and mild light bready body with nice dry minerally grassy finish. Traditional and wicked excellent. Wish I could get it in six packs.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
1699,"2015-06-02",4.1,"Draft at the brewery 30 May, 2014. Perfect cloudy gold color with lasting pillowy head. Smells awesome, the byproducts of the yeast is spot on. Great yeast presence, banana, clove and citrus. The body is medium and shows the pleasant yeast in a mild chewy texture. Carbonation gives a creaminess that coats the palate. 
Very close to all the older German examples of the style. In a blind taste test I would have said this was a German brewed beer. Authentic flavor from aroma until the finish of the sip. Without a doubt the best beer Ive had from Queen City after 2 visits.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
1699,"2015-06-01",4.2,"Cloudy orange, 1 finger head Aroma is great. yeasty, bright, a bit of lemon juice. Taste is really exceptional. Banana esters, good dense mouthfeel. a solid bitterness, some tropical fruit finish","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
1699,"2015-05-28",4.1,"Multiple pints at brewery


Aroma: big banana esters. No hop character

Appearance: pale straw, very big thick white head, very hazy

Flavor: strong banana flavor, very nice wheat

Palate: medium body, creamy, soft water

Overall: Im a regular at QCB, so Ive had lots of their beer and Im a fan of their styles and offerings. I really think this might be their best beer yet. The yeast notes imparted on this unfiltered Hefeweizen is spot on. The nice wheaty/bready backbone with the banana flavors and aroma are incredible. So far, this is probably my favorite Vermont hefeweizen.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","jamesewelch"
