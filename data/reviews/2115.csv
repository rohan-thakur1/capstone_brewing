Notes of citrus fruits (grapefruit, orange), tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, melon), florals, bready malts, leaves, and straw. Clean and hoppy at the same time.

2115,"2014-06-25",3.9,"On Draught at the Brewery.
Pours a perfectly hazy blonde with a good head and decent lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is apricot, juicy hops, and very clean maltiness. 

The flavor is pleasantly but lightly bitter with loads of fruity hops, passion fruit & apricot most identifiably. Its got a nice clean maltiness to it and is basically pretty dry with a touch of sweetness up front. 

This hop forward Golden Ale thing seems like it could really be a great style stateside, perhaps its starting to gain momentum... this is certainly not the first beer Ive seen like this one, but it is one of the better ones. 
cool","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

2115,"2014-06-23",3.7,"Sampled along the RBSG 2014 bus tour. Thanks to 4 hands for debuting this for us. An amazing and inviting hop aroma with citrus and dank. Fairly clear, pale yellow. Taste is citrus and lemon. Light and crisp. Just a touch thin and watery. Would like to see just a tad more body. Also think this should really be a session IPA, even if they call it a Blond. Way too much hop presence for a Blond (and way too good)","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
2115,"2014-06-23",4.0,"Draft on tap at the brewery (St. Louis, MO). RBSG 2014 Friday Bus Tour. Pours a pale straw yellow hue, gentle haziness but a nice bright yellow glow. Frothy whitish head atop is a nice film, sticks around as a nice ringer, laces ok. Aromas are bright and hoppy, nice fruit elements show grapefruit, tropical fruit, crisp dry grainy malts meet firmer dry, fresh hops. Initial is dry and bitter, soapy and floral meets a potent fruit melange. Citra and tropical elements give pushes but the more bitter less sweet grapefruit rind and citrus, florals push more and take the reigns. A bit fruity, small body with crisp and potent bitter grapefruit juice and rind elements. Middle is dry, a bit tropical. Clean and crisp with citrus rind, melon and and tropical lingering elements. Light, clean, bright and potent hop complexity and strength. Tasty stuff. A winner","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2115,"2014-06-23",3.7,"This is very clear and pale w/ a fine-bubbled head. It smells of peach ring candies and pine. This is a really nice light, hoppy beer. It is light bodied but still has tons of hop character. It has medium carbonation with some pine and floral notes coming out in the finish. Definitely, this is a beer made for drinking and not for sipping.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
