4541,"2013-03-17",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted cereals and fresh herbal hops  evolve in this tight, soft Svetly.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the shiny golden.
-The hop character is delicate but vibrant; like freshly-chopped herbs.
-Malts also offer biscuity grain angles.
-Very good stuff, but still cannot compete with Uneticky 12 in a tasting.
