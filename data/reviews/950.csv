950,"2016-07-21",3.1,"16 ounce can from Badger Spirits in Beloit, WI, enjoyed in a Fitgers pint glass. Hmm, didnt realize this was a California Common - not my favorite style - when I picked it up; it was the only TG beer they had in stock (more promised soon!) and itll be my first from this acclaimed young company. Well, starting off with something you dont expect to love is good, right? All roses and rainbows after this...anyway, it pours a clear light gold, moderate fully diminishing head, no residue...aroma is grassy, reasonably fresh, a hint of thistle perhaps, soft and pleasing enough but pretty subdued...really nice on the tongue though, the honey sweetness is surprising and it tastes very fresh, not cloying though quite sweet - perhaps just a touch too thick at first but drying and mellowing out somewhat towards the finish...faint dry hop presence, just enough to keep the doughy malts from sticking...ends smoothly and with a faint mineralic bite. This doesnt turn me around on the style exactly, but its a nice job and Im sure Ill enjoy the rest of the 4-pack during the heat well be getting the next couple of days.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Just slight hazy pale golden yellow with a short white head that lace the glass. Looks good at least.
Ok its old, but its surprisingly old fashioned with grains, bread and hay and a soft grassy hoppiness plus a pinch of lemon. 
Same goes with the flavour. Hay and grains, some lemon and grass. Its a bit cloying with some earthy mushroom kind of flavour, but I think thats mostly because of its age and the faded hops.

950,"2016-04-15",3.2,"Though situated in Iowa, apparently Toppling Goliaths most common beer is this California common, or steam beer. From a 50 cl can. Medium thick, regular, fairly loose head, off-white in colour and dissipating quickly, with eventually only a very thin rim of loose bubbles retaining along the edge of the glass, and in the very end, nothing at all of even that thin rim remains; lightly misty warm golden blonde colour, with slow fizz - in fact, quieter than expected based on typical style properties, but of course this can is four months old and I can imagine this being spritzier when younger. Turns more equally clouded and deeper peachy straw blonde with deposit. Aroma has the clean lager-like characteristics expected from the style while still harboring the equally expected ale-like traits: I get green apple, a lot of sourish grains and soggy sandwiches, chamomille, sourdough, a lot of unripe peach and ripe gooseberry, freshly cut grass, starfruit, dust, dry hay, moldy lemon, a hint of toast, something faintly sulfuric (struck match) and even a slight but unmistakable whiff of DMS (cooked cauliflower), something I am comparatively sensitive to. Crisp, notably fruity onset, strikingly sourish with strong reminiscence of unripe prunes, redcurrant and even a thin but refreshing lime-like acidity, paired with more subtle sweetish accents (pear, apricot); carbo is refined but effective and more effervescent than expected based on looks. A supple, lean pale and bready malt sweetishness sits underneath and carries the sourish berry flavors onwards to the finish, where they are met with a stronger breadiness created by the yeast, as in an unfiltered pale lager; a floral, slightly earthy, notably subtle hoppiness dries a little bit in the end, but does not at all provide the assertive bitterness Ive encountered in the scarce other examples of this specific, historically-based style I had so far; in fact, it is still that sourish effect which provides more dryness than the hops. The sourishness is unexpected, even a bit lemony at times, to the point where I am beginning to ask myself if this can could be mildly infected, especially since the one I had at the American beer tasting in Bruges last week wasnt nearly as sour (but then, perhaps more bland in that sense as well...). Apart from that, it does have that hybrid character between generic ale and generic lager, and is certainly refreshing, but by no means as great as I expected it to be based on this brewerys reputation - which, has not truly convinced me so far, though I must admit PseudoSue and (to a slightly lesser extent) Golden Nugget are top quality IPAs. But then, I have not had Kentucky Brunch or Morning Delight - yet...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

950,"2015-09-13",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2016 Original rating: 9/13/15. From HyVee in Bettendorf. This has a nice light Pilsner color... actually, its a little more brassy than that. Quite clear, too, for an unfiltered beer. The smell is that slightly malty beer smell that weve all been used to before we discovered that there are different kinds of beers. I like to call that it the ""bowling alley"" beer smell. Taste does not really show the northwestern hops of a California Common; it has a little bit of corn adjunct taste to it, but that ends up not standing in the way of a good layer brewer profile. If the brewers themselves had not called it a California Common, I would have just said it was a regular American Pilsner/Lager.
Addendum, 4/15/16: No change in opinion, just a note that I opened a bottle that gushered on me. I guess if this is unfiltered, there will still be some yeast at work. So lesson to me: drink more of it while its fresh.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

950,"2014-12-14",3.0,"22 oz. bottle, consumed on 12-14-14. Pours a highly effervescent, clear, pale brass with a moderate amount of pleasant, off-white head. Urine-esque coloration. Produces pretty good lacing. The color is boring; otherwise the appearance is good. Sweet, floral aroma. Apple juice scent. Perhaps a bit more to the aroma than is the case with most light-colored lagers, but not much more. Tangy, light to moderate hoppiness in the flavor. Herbal flavor features a rose petal element as well as white grape juice. Light but long bitter aftertaste. Light body. Lively in the palate. Not as crisp as most comparable lagers are, unfortunately, but rather smoother. (Later note: I didnt realize this beer is a California Common until I went to enter my rating; that explains the somewhat-but-not-so-lager-like palate effects). Overall, Im quite underwhelmed. This is an average beer for the style. I was expecting much better from Toppling Goliath. Not a bad football-watching beer, which is how Im consuming it. I bought this bottle a month or two ago, and I probably should have consumed it earlier to maximize the hops effect. That said, a well-made hoppy beer should be able 1) to hold its hops for longer than that and 2) still taste quite good (even if not as good as ideal) after the hops have faded somewhat. It does reveal increasing complexities upon multiple sips, and that does make me appreciate it more, but it still doesnt stand out in any way.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

This was poured actually into a tulip, forgive me for not having it in proper glassware. 
Anyways, heres the rest. 
The appearance was a nice looking somewhat hazy to transparent golden to yellow bronzed color to it. A decent small yet slight carbonation clears the body nicely. 
The smell had a nice sweet sticky and somewhat corn to wheat blended and slight citrus on the back end of it. 
The taste followed the nose nicely as it kept a subtle flavor of sweet malty corn and a light flavoring of caramel to back up nicely. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat subdued but mostly subtle, still no qualms. I say good for the most part.

950,"2014-05-18",3.2,"The appearance is a golden colored, translucent liquid topped by 2-3 fingers of thick, creamy, white head. After hard day of working in the yard it looks quite inviting. The aroma is definitely that of a lagerbready, somewhat sweet, accented by subtle fruit scents. Its hard to pin down what fruit, but I would say it is tending toward apple. I dont know if they use corn in this beer (for a lager from Iowa it would make sense) but the sweet notes remind me a little of sweet corn. The taste follows the nose pretty closely, although the fruit accents are muted. Unlike all of the other Topping Goliath beers Ive tried, the hops make very little contribution to the taste. The finish is drier than I was expecting, although the sweet, bready flavors linger for a while.

This beer reminded me quite a bit of Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold, which is a beer I enjoy when in the right mood. This would be good beer for drinking when working outside on a warm day. I had it with some fish and chips for dinner and it paired nicely. Nevertheless, of the half dozen or so Topping Goliath beers Ive had a chance to try, Dorothys would be my least favorite. It really needs the hops to do more to make it interesting. For that reason when reaching for a steam beer, Ill stick with the original, Anchor Steam.","Ohio, USA","Slats"

950,"2013-08-20",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2016 Draft pour at GTMW 2013. Full-on palate fatigue by the time I got to this. Pours a yellow-gold with a small white head. Notes of bready, doughy malts, dry grains, straw, grass, a hint of lemon and tea. Light-bodied, with a dry mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. So nice for the style. Excellent. Re-Rate: Bumping down a couple notches. 2016 canned version from the FL Brewhub location, Im guessing. Not as clean as before; heftier and maltier. Still a good lager, but not on the level Id remembered.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

950,"2013-02-19",3.4,"Draft on tap at The Nova (Hudson, WI). Badass. Pours a crisp hazy golden pour, some mellow haze, lively carbonation, and gentle frothy offwhite head atop that dies to a film, laces small. Good mellow glow of orange, gold, and straw with a mellow haze. Aromas are gentle citrus, grassy hops, orange and lemon and rind. Touches of straw, bready malts, and dough. Crisp maltiness, lively citrus and mellow hoppy presence. A bit of yeast, crisp and inviting. Initial is lighter end of the fold, a good variety of flavors show grainy malts, gentle dough. Some mellow grassy and earthy hops grow, lemon bites a bit, touch of orange rind. Melllow spice, yeast, and gentle straw. Grainy, the middle gives way a bit. Dry and a bit spicy as we move into the back. This never gets all that sweet, quite drinkable. Some richer citrus elements unfold on the palate, good lingering bready malts, grain, straw, and gentle spiciness hits the palate. Pretty damn nice, a good amount of spiciness, earthy hops, gentle yeast really linger on into the backend. Crisp and lighter body, but pretty damn flavorful for me. Its the simplest things that often work the best. Nice job.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
