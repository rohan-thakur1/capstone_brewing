2646,"2013-08-18",3.3,"Sampled from tap at the brewpub on July 11, 2013.As ""Paddys Wheat Unfiltered"".Hazy yellow color, white head. Sweet, malty, banana scent. Sweet, sugary, phenolic, bitter taste. Bitter, banana aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, medium bitterness.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
2646,"2013-04-11",3.0,"Pours a hazy yellow with a white head. Aroma is wheaty, fruit, banana, yeast and some spice. Taste is light sweet of wheat leading to a fruity finish. Decent.","Central Coast, NSW, AUSTRALIA","Sevenlee"
2646,"2008-03-03",2.6,"Draught @ the brewpub Wasnt too sure if this was a Wheat beer or a Wit. Smells a bit like honey with a touch of lemon in the taste as well, cloves in and out as well. Still it was drinkable.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
2646,"2006-08-14",3.4,"The previous comments regarding the witbier/weizen meld seemed to ring true with my sample, as I was sure I could taste some orange and coriander. Either they are still using that mix or I am talking out of my arse (which are equally likely). Quite a well balanced flavour, and very more-ish and refreshing. Good depth of flavour although the finish is a bit short. However allround its a pretty decent beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"
2646,"2006-03-26",3.2,"Above-average Aussie wheat beer. Not a favourite style but this seemed pretty true to its benchmark. Bright gold with a skinny, lasting head. Qutie a creamy aroma (seems to be a house feature). Quite chewy wheat and clove notes. A swirl released some sourish banana. Soft banana flavours, clove - pretty much what youd expect. Overall, very clean and a very fair attempt. (Draught at brewpub)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
2646,"2006-02-06",3.5,"Draught at the brewpub.  Clear pale yellow. Typical weizenbier banana aroma. Sweet and soft with some light toffee flavour. Nicely drinkable with well structure malt. I like it!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2646,"2004-05-25",2.3,"With push coming to shove my least style of beer includes the wheat. A large generalisation I know but partly because I have a degree of wheat intolerance but more predominantly due the enjoyment of a more assertive style. So many so-called aussie wheats are poor substitutes for piss-poor lagers. This one unfortunately has more of the latter characters than some of the good Euro styles. Quite typically estery with pineapple and banana but just not a great one. I think, to be fair, that this was not tried in a reasonable order so that certain predecessors may have clouded my review","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"
2646,"2004-05-05",2.6,"Draught, at Paddys Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. This beer looks all the world like a larger. Amber with a bright, persistent white head. Bubblegum aroma and flavour, with all the other classic notesbanana and glove. (I was in the Eczematic school of sniffing on this evening). The gathering: duff, eczematic, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully and late arrival Linc.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"
2646,"2004-04-27",3.0,"hey, not a bad kristall. was expecting a watery ""american wheat"" since it's so clear, but then all the right stuff was going on in the flavour - plenty of bubblegum, clove and just the right amount of banana (not OTT like JS colonial) and a decent malty body.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
2646,"2004-03-06",2.8,"Orange, banana, vanilla as mentioned by the others. Decent tasty hefe, I couldn't compare it to a traditional German draught version but it worked for me. Refreshing.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
2646,"2004-02-01",3.0,"Not bad at all, but am also confused what the style is, not quite a German Heffe Kristall as listed in my opinion. Banana Paddlepops (but in a good way), vanilla, clove. Smooth, summery, slight tart/sour characters, lightly spicy, quite tasty in the end, as are most of the Paddys beers.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
2646,"2004-01-26",3.4,"mullet's rght about the confusion as to whch style this is - it said on a sign at the brewery that this was a wit beer with bohemian hops(?). but it is a good wheat beer. couldn't taste any spice. a real minimum of banana and vanilla - more of an american wheat but the wheat is flavourful and fresh with some slight sourness and saltiness. just the thing after a hard day's trucking","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
2646,"2004-01-07",2.8,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2006 Slight chill haze, good head retention, pale.
They seem to be a bit confused as to whether its a Wit or a Bavarian Weisse, or ""weiss beir"" as they call it. Seems to me like a German wheat with coriander. Anyway theres all the right clovey stuff and all that but its lacking the nice maltiness to make a nice Weizen. High carbonation, but I guess thats appropriate here.RR: Tasted like a German wheat this time, but still didnt blow me away. Competent without being particularly good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"
