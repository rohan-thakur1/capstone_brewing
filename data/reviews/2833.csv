2833,"2017-06-01",3.6,"Hazy golden color. Frothy white head. I thought the nose had considerable brett though no indication its used in this beer. , biscuity nose with some dry grassy and lemon notes. Dry, the body is slightly lacking and there isnt enough bitterness. Bone bone dry mouth. Dry finish with lingering brett and oak character. Very different take on a pils. I like but dont love it","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

2833,"2017-05-16",3.6,"10th rater. What makes this Italian style? Do you have to use a lot of gestures when talking about it? It is a softer and thicker mouthfeel. Pale clear gold color. Is that make it Italian? It has no pizza or pasta... hmm, Im skeptical. Malty beer for a pils, thick white Wonder bread. Light hop touches peek through. Soft malt and cottony finish.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

2833,"2016-11-03",4.0,"Draught at the Portland location, 10/21/16.Clear, pale-brass with a good deal of fine bubbles rising to create a small, yet modestly-well retained white head.Great minerality in the nose with light sourdough notes and a strong herbal character to it that goes so far as to become lightly citrusy. Notes of white grape, light pepper and soft apples also enter in to the aroma and overall its a very snappy, bright, lightly fruity nose without any resin, alcohol or flaw. Seemingly quite dry from the nose, as well.Dry indeed in the mouth, yet with ample maltiness in the texture with light residual sugars, as well. Grassy, herbal, lightly sweaty hops add lemon and white grape notes that add complexity and enjoyable fruitiness to the dry, herbal, peppery character. Light to moderate bitterness, enough to balance and keep things crisp with strong, but tight carbonation. Delicate and awesome.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
