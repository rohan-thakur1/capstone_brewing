1337,"2011-01-24",4.0,"Bottle @ Naboen, Bergen. Pours a magnificent-looking, thick, creamy off-white head hovering majestically above a deep, dense coppery red body. Nose is dark fruits, caramel, raisins and hints of marzipan in a very nice, subtle combination. Taste is highly original: sweet caramel tones come first, before the whole brew takes a detour down into some seriously low, dark and damp cellar-like earthy tones. Then, as you just begin to get enough of the basement flavors, the beer lifts again, displaying an array of contrast: toffee, roasted malts and almonds. Damn this is one good brew to have a ride with! :-) Moreover, getting Norwegian-made beers in the Scottish tradition is rare enough to tickle my pickle, thats for sure. I do, however, recommend sharing this one with a friend or two, as the bottle is 75 cl and the beer is a bit too much in the sweet zone for one person to finish comfortably alone. Perhaps a 0,33 or 0,5 liter version of this one would be a good idea. Nevertheless, I think Kinn has created another X-mas classic, now all I can hope for is being able to get this from the shelves of Vinmonopolet next Christmas.
