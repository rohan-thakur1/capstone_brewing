Crisp and clear copper and light amber coloured body with a nice, fast-dying two centimetre tall off-white head. Aroma of very nice soured cherry, raspberry, oak, vanilla, yeast, funk and even more of a spontaneous fermented gueuze-y like smell that makes everything mouthwatering. Light-bodied; Strong cherry flavour at first with a big dose of oak and funk right behind, along with some other fruit notes, a touch of vanilla and ending with a lot of yeast complexities and fermented sugars. Aftertaste shows more of the cherry and funky flavours with a definite and nice sour flavour throughout along with some complexities from the oak aging and yeast notes that ends with a lot of funk, a good sour quality and a smooth complexity and relatively easy-to-drink quality for the summertime. Overall, a very nice sour beer with a smooth complexity and a fruity sweetness that shows very well and makes the large format bottle pretty easy to drink!

3429,"2017-03-09",3.8,"This is the elusive ""pretty good"" sour; as opposed to the sours that I either hate or that I think are damn near perfect. This one isnt damn near perfect, but it is damn near pretty damn good. So, pretty good. It pours very clear copper/orange with a head that fades to a stubborn ring. The aroma is nice, apple cider and vinegar and a little red wine, but its understated. Not quite as inviting or as absorbing as Rodenbachs Grand Cru or New Belgiums damn near perfect La Folie. The flavor is also great, athough it starts out very much on the mild side and saves all of its cards to play at the end. In the finish I pick up on big red-wine vinegar, olives, lime and oak and smoke. I guess saving all your big notes for the finish is okay when theyre this big.

3429,"2017-01-14",3.7,"RichTV is quite a unique individual. 
His typical day starts around noon, when he rolls off his dirty mattress (which sits directly on his stained, matted shag carpet), onto his floor. His breath smells of dumpster juice and he is missing the standard amount of teeth, for a Brit. He is surrounded by week old Pizza Hut boxes, empty 3 liter bottles of Frosty Jacks, vomit stained walls and piles of dirty clothes. Speaking of piles, his first stop on the welfare train is to apply ointment to the affected areas. Twice daily. 
He really doesnt have ""pajamas"" in the traditional sense, so theres no need to change after his ""shower"", which consists solely of applying aerosol deodorant to his entire body, save for the oozing areas. (The alcohol burns the open sores) 
He flops back down on the mattress as he tries to figure out what he wants to do today. His welfare card has recently been replenished and his mobility scooter is fully charged. Things are looking good! 
He loads up the basket on his scooter with multiple warm bottles of white cider and starts off down the road at a blazing 2.5mph. He furiously curses and scowls at the people and cars in his way, ignoring all laws and regulations. His destination is his favorite park bench, where he can rest and drink his cider the rest of the day. 
Its now 5pm and he is completely shattered. A hunger has developed, but luckily his strategic position at the park makes for a short 2 minute drive to KFC. He is sloppy drunk as he navigates across the street, avoiding traffic as best he can. His mobility scooter slams into the glass doors of KFC and Rich falls off, in a slow comical motion. Luckily, no cider was spilled. As he lies flat on his back, he pulls the 3 liter plastic bottle to his lips and quenches a deep thirst. Gathering himself, he crawls inside and holds up his benefits card as he yells, ""20 piece bucket, you cunts!!!"" The crew has seen this so often before, they arent even phased. 6 people help to lift him back onto his welfare chariot and tuck the bucket of chicken into his basket. 
""See you tomorrow, Rich!"" 
""Feck off, cunt!"" replies Rich as slowly rolls out the door and back down the sidewalk. He has his chicken. He has his cider. He has his welfare. He is now back home, and the circle of welfare is complete. Another adventure awaits tomorrow!

Enjoyed this at Dougs house for a small gathering on May 01 with Travis, ebone1988, and I think Charlie made an appearance as well. 750 mL bottle shared by ebone1988. The pour is a surprisingly darker orange color with a thicker off white head that falls down pretty quickly, leaving some stringy and soapy lace. The aroma is surprisingly spicy. There is a ton of rye and a vinous funkiness. Its got a little lactic acid in there that makes for a strange smell. The fruit skins help try to bring this one back, but they do kind of stick to the nose. The flavor is interesting. The spiciness stays pretty relevant. There is a decent funk, and a light fruit that carry through the flavor, but nothing really meshes there. The mouth feel is oily and a little heavy. There is a lighter carbonation that help it not seem as thick, which is a good thing. The aftertaste is mostly fruit skins and the strong rye spice. Its an interesting sour, for sure.

The pour is a slight haze golden orange with a one inch foamy slightly off white head that falls slower than the Love Child No. 6, but still fairly quick. The aroma is bright floral citrus, tart sour lacto notes and a soft oak wood that is almost buttery smelling in the back. Almost Chardonnay reminiscent. The taste is floral citrus with lemon lacto, cherry fruit. All flavors more tart than sour. Flavor moves quickly to the buttery wood of the oak (butter fades as the beer warms - so not diacetyl, must be from the wood), and finishes with a pleasant hint of funk. Really nails the Flanders style with the tart cherry. The palate is medium bodied with active carbonation and the funk wood cherry lingering in the finish.

3429,"2016-05-01",4.0,"Bottle shared with koleminer20, Travis, and Doug. Aroma is funky, some kind of spice, tart, barnyard, real good. Appearance is amber brown, light tan head, somewhat hazy. Taste is tart, ginger, rye, funky, nice. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light carbonation, ginger funk aftertaste. Overall, this is pretty tasty.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
3429,"2016-04-25",3.9,"The beer pours reddish copper with a small head and its pretty clear. The aroma has lots of funk with some blue cheese, cherries, sourness, oak, vanilla, cranberries and lots of bugginess. It has a medium body with lots of crispness and abundance of carbonation. The taste starts much more sour than the aroma with under ripe berries, vinegar, bugs/funk, orange juice and a brightness. The finish has some of the blue cheese and oak from the aroma rounding things up a bit. Another winner of a love child for boulevard.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3429,"2016-04-22",3.5,"Pours clear, bubbly copper-orange with a thick, frothy, and rather persistent ivory head. Strong, sour fruit aroma has apple, pear and tropical notes. Puckeringly sour flavor presents an assortment of fruit, apple and pear and tropical and even a little dark fruit, with snips of malt, hops and wood. Mouthfeel delivers firm body if not much fizz, and a nice fruity finish. Love this wild child!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
