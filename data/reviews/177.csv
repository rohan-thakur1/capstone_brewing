Perhaps better so. Taste is bitter, lightly sour, turning increasingly dry and sour in the finish. A touch of chocolate and coffee. Mild hazelnut in the aftertaste. Makes an assertive and balanced impression. Palate has a touch too much carbonation at the outset for my taste in this style of beer; a bit prickly at the outset, but not enough of a disturbance to ruin the overall impression. Over the 25 minute session it settled to a more pleasant level. Alcohol remains perfectly disguised. Overall, despite a few flaws, a very good brew.","Butzbach, Hesse, GERMANY","hauxe"

177,"2017-03-03",4.9,"En voilà un Porter de très haute voltige ! Limite Black IPA ou Imperial Stout, clairement ! Versée noire débène, transparence inexistante, mousse beige à souhait, voir brune ! Nez sur les malts torréfiés surpuissant, un alcool vivifiant, de la résine, du bois, du café et du cacao amer en veux tu en voilà, des notes suaves de pruneaux, de figue et de banane séchées, de la noix et de la noisette, du sirop dérable, du cuir, du miel de châtaigne... Pas franchement le nez dun Porter mais clairement celui dun Imperial Stout ! En bouche, le cacao et le café sautent à la figure, les levures viennent jouer des coudes dans la foulée, lamertume vient claquer comme un fouet pour nous laisser subitement sur une texture douce, huileuse, salvatrice. La brûlure et ensuite la Biafine ! La seconde gorgée persiste sur les levures, vraiment présentes et pas masquées par lalcool discret et lamertume cacaoté vraiment prenante. La troisième sarticule sur les malts cara et chocolat, le fond de commerce véritable de cette bière. Pourquoi je la compare à un moment donné à une Black IPA ? Parce que lamertume est costaude et très, très longue et fait immanquablement penser à une IPA. Mais cest un Porter grâce à sa texture, incroyable de douceur malgré cette avalanche dastringence. En fait on ne sait plus trop, et cest ça la force de cette bière. Très honnêtement je ne mettrais pas la note suprême car il me manque le petit je ne sais quoi qui me fait craquer, peut être un alcool trop sage, (je viens de menfiler précédemment une Troubadour Obscura qui ma juste mis une gifle...), mais très franchement, très grand cru que cette Must Kuld (ma première Estonienne, youpi !) qui tape allègrement dans plusieurs styles sans en pervertir aucun.

177,"2016-05-28",4.0,"Acclaimed Estonian porter - probably famous because of its suggestive label, and I must admit that I too misinterpreted it until I bought a bottle and got a closer look at it... Well, it is an original means of attracting attention, to say the least. Medium thick, moussy, creamy, pale yellowish beige head consisting of densely packed, tiny bubbles retaining well on the edge and as a thin beige membrane on the surface of the liquid, which in itself has a black colour revealing its deep, warm wine red hue on the edges. Strong aroma of cured meat, veal stock cube, bitter cocoa, caramel, cold black coffee, toasted walnut, black tea, lots of iron but not feeling unnatural, stewed beef, noga, candied date, burnt sugar, fresh oyster mushroom and even a very faint hint of vanilla. In the mouth, I get sweet, sour and umami in a nicely balanced combo: underlying basic black fruit sourishness, dried fig and even very light brown sugar sweetishness and soft dried meat- and mushroom-like umami, none of which really dominates the other. The iron effect from the nose comes forward at an early stage, as a kind of metallic sound all the way through, thinly resting on top of a smooth, creamy malt body, starting with caramelly sweetness but very quickly turning bitterly toasted and ending even a tad coffeeish. Finishes with this mouth cavity-coating toasted bittersweetness, a bit oily, along with a peppery and floral hop accent, retronasal toasted bread and dried fruits and a dash of warming but otherwise non-intrusive alcohol. I am used to porters and stouts having a certain amount of iron character, but in this one it really struck me both in the nose and in the mouth. Still, it has enough aroma, flavor and body to tolerate this and in fact, it distinguishes it a bit from the rest. I love porters and this one is a very good, heavily toasted example - so toasted in fact, that it could just as well have been labelled as a stout, but never mind: lovely beer. And not just for the label.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

177,"2016-03-20",5.0,"OMG. I have no words. If God would be available in liquid form, I think this comes close to what in would look like. Maybe this is it. The looks are amazing to start with. The color of the beer is pitch and pitch black on the naked eye. When seen with a bright light a extremely dark reddish brown color shows. But, it still looks almost black. The beer pours a beautiful yellowy brown soft creamy foam. When pouring, a lot of foam forms, but a lot of it collapses in with the time. A nice layer of creamy foam remains on top of the beer till the beer is finished. The smell of the beer reminds me of my vacation in Dublin, where weve drunk a lot of amazing porters in places like J.W. Sweetman and the Porterhouse Brewing Company. Comparing this beers with the beers there is the biggest compliment I can give. The smell has a rich and strong roasted barley aroma. This gives the beer a strong bitter aroma. I love this. The beer also had a delicious sweet and sour fresh hop aroma. The combination between the strong roasted aroma, reminding me of coffee and roasted cacao beans, and the hop aroma is truly define. Only porters have this amazing combination. This smell retrieves so many good memorys. A beer that is able to do this, is a great beer. After you are done with the amazing smell of the beer, there is also a heavenly taste to discover. The beer has a strong bitterness, focused by the coffee and cacao been like flavors of roasted barley. There is also a tremendous freshness, doused by the hops. This gives the beer a slightly sweet and sour taste. The taste also has a beautiful sweetness, which forms a beautiful balance with the bitter roast flavor. The beer has a very nice palate. The carboxylation is just perfect. The gas bubbles are tingling happily upon your tongue. The beer also has something creamy. It is just perfect. It really finishes a great productive day. Im happy now.

177,"2014-07-15",3.5,"(Bottle, 0.33 l - batch 010 - BB 27.12.2014, at Koht, 20140715) The beer poured black. Its head was medium sized and lightly brown. Aroma had coffee, chocolate, burnt malts and sweetness. Palate was full bodied with medium carbonation. Flavours were sweetness, chocolate, coffee, burnt malts and bitterness. Afteraste had chocolate, cocoa and bitterness. A bit too much on the sweet side but otherwise nice brew.","Helsinki, FINLAND","mjs"
177,"2014-07-13",3.4,"Bottle from Tallinna Kaubamaja ( 3), July 2014. Batch 010. The laconic label features an unsharp photo of a roasted malt seed that, as one critic put it, looks a bit frivolic - true that. Pours a deep brown, black in the glass with a huge creamy head. Nose is rich: sweet, dark chocolate, even sugary-syrupy notes and roastiness most notable, some sharpness there too, maybe recalling a bit of liquorice, also slightly ashy. Taste is very sweet, chocolaty-syrupy, burnt sugar, and a good deal of alcoholic warmth there too. The roastiness comes only after that; finish is bitter, a bit sour even. A smooth, soft, creamy texture - I see perfectly what the lactose does here, too bad I cant stand the damn thing. Very soft carbonation, medium to full body. If you ever get cravings for a big fat chocolate cake, this here would be a good alternative. Too sweet for my taste; plus, the lactose makes my tummy feel like a war zone.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"
177,"2014-07-13",3.4,"33cl bottle. Malts and raw coco aroma. Pours pitch black with dark brown, chocolaty head. Rather sweet, and it makes it a good desert porter. It is oily and smooth, but not watery. Thickness is there, and it is not transparent at all. It is a good summer sweet porter - the one you finish your evening with.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Senka"

Aroma is roast, sour, coffee, and some alcohol. Taste is sweet, sour and bitter, roast, coffee, dark chocolate, and lactose. Finish is long dark chocolate bitter with hints of smoke. Overall: nice brew.
Have had some sh*tty bottles over the time, but the last one I had a couple of days ago was really great. Bumping overall by +2.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"

Initially a lovely rich chocolate cakey aroma, later its more marmitey. Slightly thin palate, too fizzed up by being keg. Keg sucks. Lovely cakey roast, mocha. Just a tiny ashy hint. Touch of earthy bitterness in the finish, Bramling X? Could have been very good, but keg ruined this. I do have a bottle...
Rerate: 330ml bottle - thanks Chris! (7:4+:7:4:14=3.6+)
Lovely chocolate cakey aroma again, but really dark. Looks great, very dark brown, tight tan head. Simple roasty porter in the mouth, but the lovely burnt roast really comes into its own as you swallow. More of the chocolate cake, definitely. Full palate, smooth, slightly sweet. Finish does become a little ashy later, but thats accompanied by a lovely metallic biting-on-foil bitterness which works very well together. Top porter, the ashiness is the only thing Id tone down a little.

Best before? Best before?!? Nonsense, this is better than ever! Beautifully mellowed, soft and velvetty. All harshness has gone, a super mocha cakey roast remains.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
