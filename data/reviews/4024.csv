4024,"2017-05-27",3.8,"On tap, Kumas Too. Pretty exciting to finally get hold of one of these legendary Three Floyds beers! This was deep amber almost copper in colour, much more caramel malt and resulting sweetness than I expected. White foam, medium carbonation. Very hop plant hoppiness, fresh. More than any beer Ive ever had it tasted like you were sucking on the hops, or maybe their juices, before they go into the kettle. Grapefruit, citrus, a bit of pine, but also quite...hoppy. Quite bitter. Clearly a great brewing effort to get that intensity and faithfulness of flavour, but was it actually the nicest or most drinkable pale Ive had? Probably not.","Greater London, ENGLAND","JorgeLee"

Pours a beautiful hazy rose-tinged orange with a beige cap. On the nose, CONCENTRATED resinous notes, passion fruit, grapefruit, caramel. Fuller bodied, and above average sweetness with peach, apricot, passion fruit, and light caramel that tames itself into caramel, with light fruity notes under the resinous bitterness. This is like a DIPA hiding in a pale ale. I am beyond impressed with this. The best APA Ive had by far. Wow. Wow.","Ontario, CANADA","Frothmeister"

Plus the prices point is far too high. 6 pack of this avg apa for $14 or an amazing say fist city 6 pack for $9. Or a half acre daisy cutter. Not about the price though.

4024,"2014-10-25",4.0,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a burnt orange-amber color with a bit of redishness and a nice three finger head of pure white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading to leave a fantastic level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest bready smell mixed with a lighter level of a grapefruit hop. Along with these aromas comes some grass and pine as well as little bit of caramel to produce a rather nice aroma overall.

 Taste- The taste begins with a great bready and slightly doughy taste. Along with these flavors comes some hop notes of a mainly grapefruit hop taste along with a little bit of a caramel and some light toast. The toast and caramel remain rather light throughout the taste, with the bready and doughy tastes fading just a bit. Other hop flavors of a grassy and pine flavor join the now slightly stronger grapefruit to leave a rather bready and nicely hopped flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is average to slightly thicker than average with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The feel is very good for the hop and bready flavors of the brew and makes for a nice more mouth coating medium, but is not overly thick to kill the more refreshing pale ale characteristics of the beer.

 Overall  A very nice pale ale overall with tons of great flavors and a nice hop blend. This is renowned for a reason it is very good.","","Darkmagus82"

Mouth-feel is light with soft carbonation, but it glides smoothly across the tongue. Taste is sweet citrus, grapefruit on front palate. Toffee honeyed malt seizes the initiative driving the flavor towards a lasting medium-bitter finish.

4024,"2014-03-17",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2016 12 oz bottle poured into a vase-like glass. The very first whiffs are a skunky, marijuana-like smell, but this fades quickly. This is replaced with a sweet lemon and orange citrus aroma. Underneath that, theres a heavy dose of resin, bubblegum, and pine. Later on a light, toasty bread aroma comes through. The body is a slightly hazy amber orange color topped by a soft, gelatin looking yellow-brown head. The head is big, soft, and fluffy, but slowly recedes to a sheet of light head on top. This leaves lots of lace down the glass. The taste strikes a beautiful balance between medium levels of sweet and bitter (Three Floyds strikes again!). The medium bodied beer has lots of active carbonation with resin-ish texture. The mouth starts out with a moderate pine and resin feel, but shortly gives way to sweet citrus and a hint of bubblegum. The sweetness becomes more prevalent as the drink warms. The finish is dry, crisp, and clean with mostly lemon and resin notes. This does linger for a bit, but its refreshing. After awhile, some toast and toffee notes start to come through in the finish and, more notably, in the aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

6.66% ABV 68 IBU 

APPEARANCE: Poured out a vibrant rust color. Star bright clear no haziness at all. Great big pillowy egg shell white head. Great retention and lacing. 

AROMA: Strong pine and citrus right away. Smells like breakfast of fresh squeezed orange juice and warm toast. Malty sweetness and carmel. 

TASTE: Another 3 Floyds APA that drinks like an IPA to me. Very piney and citrus right up front. Hops hit in the middle and rounds out with that great maltiness I got on the nose. Literally taste so good makes you want to slap yo mama!

MOUTHFEEL: Medium to light body along with the carbonation. Dry snappy finish that almost leaves you thirsty. 

OVERALL: Once again very impressed with a 3 Floyds brew. Still can't believe this is an APA reminds me of a wonderful low key west coast IPA. Would for sure try and get more of this goodness.

T: The malts die down a bit here. Allowance for the hops to shine, provide the bitterness and balance I anticipated in the nose. Theres a woodiness and oaky profiling that nearly dominate the entire palate experience.

Pours a slightly hazy amber with off white head. Good lacing. Aroma of citrus, flowers and pine. Taste is moderate sweetness with a nice lading bitterness. Very well balanced. Tastes of citrus, caramel, pine. Medium bodied with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Very good pale ale but a step below zombie dust in my opinion. Can't go wrong with Three Floyds.

The color is dark reddish and my pour produced a finger or two of tan colored head which was surprisingly thick.

4024,"2013-05-29",4.1,"Appearance:
Deep garnet with copper edges under a tight off-white head which fades into a thin layer marked by tiny bubbles. Swirls with lace and bubbles.

Nose:
Grab pine tree in hand  shove face into its branches, needles, and bark  inhale deeply and dont stop. Wow! Pine forest in a glass with a river of lemon zest underneath and apple skins in the back for some crisp crunch.

Palate:
Clean bodied with medium weight. Crunchy melba and toast underneath along with red apple skins. Pine trees explode atop my tastebuds while grapefruit and mint weave in and out. Boldly balanced. Menthol and pine mingle in my breath. Bitterness of hop leaves and resins instigate a never ending thirst. A bit more lemon on the back top of my tongue followed by quaff and repeat, leaving not a single drop behind.

Final Thoughts:
Sometimes a highly rated hyped beer is just that, hype, but in the case of Alpha Kind from Three Floyds Brewing, there is no hype, just lip smacking tastetacular sessionability I could drink day in and day outif I lived a little bit closer. Until we meet again

Well, I would if I had easy access to it. Anyway!

Appearance: A brown/copper color with a nice, bubbly, somewhat tan head. Lacings patchy, but it has a great, clear appearance overall.

Smell: What do I say? It has a brilliant malty and hop balance. On one sniff it smells of caramel sweetness, and on the next it smells of hoppy deliciousness. Extremely inviting.

Taste/feel: Just an awesome beer. The most dominant flavor that I get is of a quality, caramel malt on the start. The finish is super clean, and offers a burst of fresh hops. Not only is this beer pretty much perfectly balanced, it has an outstanding flavor. Theres virtually no aftertaste, which makes me want to keep going back for another sip.

Huge off-white head, damn another great smelling beer from fff, floral, spicey, tropical, great nose! This also taste as good as advertised, perfectly balanced (balanced to my Americanized hop destroyed palate) its the perfect step back from an American IPA proper. Citrusy hoppy on the palate immediately balanced by the malts. The finish is also clean v. an IPA which I am actually digging a lot.

S: Slighty malty with nice high hop presence. The main note is grapefruit and with a subtle floral component mixed in.

At the first sip you get a near pungent hoppy flavor, but wait one second and it just melts away - gliding down the troath. Really tasty and it feels so integrated and balanced! Seriously considering a refill on this one. Not often I do that in a beer festival, but this? 12.05.2012","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Hazy reddish russet colour, thin beige head.  Toffee and hop aroma.  Yes big intense resiny grapefruit hop in the mouth.  Wow thats pretty big and awesome. Is it as good as I was hoping?  Its different.  Its big hoppy and toffeeish so very much in the American mould of an IPA I would say rather than an APA.  Certainly tastes fresh on the hops.  Yes very drinkable at same time.  No real heat.  Toffee is really quite pleasant.  Good beer, but when you set your impression so high, its hard to live up to it.  Thanks Craig.

Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy for an APA but still manageable and not too carbonated.  Taste is quite hoppy.  This really is a mild IPA but its not bitter really at all which is why Im not deducting points for being out of style (ahem, Dales Pale Ale, ahem!).  Chalk, flowers, mild, mild pine, pineapple, mango and lemon are present.  This really is a fantastic pale ale.  I couldnt drink too many of them because they are so hoppy my palate would be trashed after two.  Very, very good.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"
4024,"2012-04-02",4.3,"I may not be a brewer but I know an IPA when I taste one and Id categorize Three Floyds Alpha King as a beer of that style, even though it purports to be a ""pale ale."" This is definitely a hop heads delight: strong bitterness, huge hop aroma, and a fairly well-balanced palate to make it enjoyable in many aspects.

I received a 12oz bottle in a trade (thanks, Joseph!). I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Dark orange to brick red color; noticeably cloudy body. Forms an average size, ivory, frothy head which retains and laces quite well.

Smell: As soon as I popped the top I could smell the citrus. Strong orange notes are prevalent here, plus some pine needle and other woodsy/earthy scents. A hint of caramel too.

Taste: From the appearance and aroma I knew Three Floyds Alpha King was not going to be your usual pale ale and the first swig confirmed my suspicion. Strong bitterness as soon as the beer hits the tongue. Orange is the dominant flavor - delivering a strong citrusy taste thats borderline tart. Then it gives way to more sweet flavors of orange sherbet ice cream and caramel or butterscotch syrup. The finish goes in the opposite direction with pine flavors, plus a general rustic/earthy taste. The hops linger on the tongue for a while and are quite drying, but theres no cloying aftertaste from the sweetness.

The flavors present here are quite delectable and robust to be sure. However, this is a little overboard for a pale ale. Id estimate the bitterness as 60-70 IBUs, which detracts from the cleaner, more refreshing and juicy flavors I prefer in a pale ale. Still, its a beer that never homogenizes or peters out as the last swig is just as tasty as the first. 

Drinkability: At 6.5% ABV, Three Floyds Alpha King is a bit bigger than your average pale ale. The mouthfeel is certainly thicker, although it still maintains the crisp carbonation without the chewiness of an IPA. It goes down very smooth, but the hops linger and dry out the mouth. Despite the energy of this brew, its easy to drink quickly, and throwing back several of these in a row will catch up to you quickly. An excellent beer to pair with a strong meal, or something to have to wake your taste buds up.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

4024,"2012-02-23",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/5/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Alpha King pours a slightly hazy, robust copper color, with a soft, pillowy, off-white head. Good retention, and some resilient lace stick. 

Sweet malt, citrus hops. Some floral hops provide support. Always a nice, strong hop profile in FFF offerings.

Sweet caramel biscuity malt, which gets sweeter as it warms. The sweetness clings to my taste buds as a citrus hoppiness comes into play. 

The malt provides a surprising amount of creamy and chewy feel. Medium carbonation. All this wrapped up in a medium body.

For me, this is the ultimate drinkable pale ale. Maybe it is more IPA than APA, but I could care less. I almost always keep this in my fridge. The balanced hop flavor really does it for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Fruity, citrusy hops dominate, with notes of grapefruit and pineapple catching the most attention. The big hop character is present in the flavor as well, but the citrus is less pronounced, giving way to more of an earthy and spicy hop presence. Unfortunately, although the light, fine carbonation is pleasant enough for the style, the texture doesnt stand up to the resinous, coating hop profile.

Taste is citrus and resinous with bits of bread and malt barely breaking onto the scene. Long lingering hop bite in the finish is there but never harsh.

Appearance: Slightly hazy orangish-amber with off-white head and light lacing.

Aroma: Centennial and Cascade goodness  grapefruit, orange and a sharp spiciness over some light toasted malt.

Taste: Grapefruit comes through even more strongly in the taste, and is borderline tart. Orange and toasted malt round out the flavor profile, with a lingering spicy and bitter finish. Somewhat of a Lagunitas-type profile. And yes, Lagunitas is almost a style unto itself.

Palate: Fairly full-bodied for a Pale Ale, with moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. Pretty oily and sticky.

4024,"2011-08-25",4.3,"A - Pours a fairly clear copper-orange color with a finger of frothy slightly off-white head atop. The head fades slowly leaving behind some nice lacing.

S - Aroma has a nice kick of fresh citrus hops. There is also a nice balance provided by the sweet caramel malts in the background. Really excellent nose.

T - Starts off with a nice punch of citrus hops and some bitterness. Not far behind is the sweet caramel malts playing catchup to provide a good balance. Through the middle, the caramel malts get a bit deeper and richer and the hop flavor stays balanced alongside. The finish is a mix of some citrus hops and bitterness with some sweet caramel malts that linger.

M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer is super smooth and extremely well balanced from start to end.

D - Super drinkable. Pretty much every aspect of this beer is excellently balanced. The hop profile is really fantastic from start to end and everything else just falls into place around that.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"
4024,"2011-08-24",4.3,"Very strong hoppy aroma, a kick in the teeth for an APA.  It does have a juiciness to it but offset by a lot of dry pine.

4024,"2011-06-21",4.1,"12oz bottle, unknown date.  Big thanks to my boss for picking some up on his recent visit to Chicago.  Served at around 45F.
Pours clear copper amber with a large off white head that leaves tons of rings of sticky lacing and holds a thick cap.  Beautiful to behold.

Aroma is strong on citrus and floral hops with underlying layers of pine and earth.  Some caramel malt and toasted bread as well.  Good to very good strength.

Flavor is again strong on the citrus hops, some tropical fruit, a bit resinous with a good caramel and bready malt backbone with mild sweetness that finishes with good bitterness for a Pale Ale.  Little to no alcohol detected.  Very tasty and immensely drinkable. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, with soft to medium carbonation.

Is this the best Pale Ale Ive had?  Yes, yes I think it just may well be.  Damned tasty, aromatic and beautiful to look at and its going down oh so fast.

I like this beer almost as much as I love Fats Waller.  Normally I prefer darker, more complicated beers and jazz (Russian Imperial Stout, Thelonious Monk, Bitches Brew, Porter or King Porter Stomp)  but I cant find anything negative at all about this pale ale.  Yes, its pure hoppiness but very refreshing and not at all skunky.  I drove to Hammond, IN to pick up a six pack of this for the weekend and will definitely make that drive again, since its nowhere to be found on the South Side of Chicago.

This was one of the first beers that wowed me when I was new to this site and gave it a gushing review.  SInce then, it has become more available, and I have found a few worthy competitors.

The hop character is dominant but not overwhelming, since the malt backbone is strong enough to sustain it, besides providing a nutty touch that perfectly complements the piney aroma from the hops. The body is medium and perfectly carbonated, making for an extremely refreshing drink. This might be the perfect marriage between flavor and drinkability. Amazing APA and amazing beer overall.

There is also a subtle sweetness and hay malt flavor that gives this beer a nice complexity.  The hop bitterness is particularly prevalent making this beer, in my opinion, more like an IPA than a mere Pale Ale.  The palate is light to medium bodied, rather dry, and easy bitter aftertaste.

How this beer is different from an IPA is sort of hard to say (as there are beers that are labeled IPAs that taste pretty similar), but in any case, there is a lot of bitterness, yet the bitterness does not overkill and linger for too long, instead it leaves an impact and then kind of goes its own way. The real beauty of this beer is in the balance. The body is light enough to enjoy these at length and the flavors all work together quite perfectly.

4024,"2011-02-03",4.2,"From notes:

Pours a hazy, dark golden orange/amber color with a two finger frothy, pillowy off-white head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Large chunks of soapy lacing are left coating the glass.

Sweet citrus hop aroma with hints of earthy pine and tropical fruit. Subtle malt backbone but the nose of this beer is all about the hops with lots of grapefruit, citrus peel, mango and pineapple.

Medium bodied and very hop forward for the style with a blast of bitter, earthy hops that are countered by sweet citrus presence and a subtle malt backbone. Hints of pine needle, grapefruit, citrus peel, mango and pineapple as well as a subtle biscuit/graham cracker flavor that provides nice balance. This beer is much closer to an IPA than a pale ale with lots of oily, resinous hop flavor and a nice dry finish. Complex, well balanced and extremely quaffable.

Combination is very interesting and not aggressive. The mix is excellent and the balance is very good, interesting bitterness. Cant think of another other than Victory for a bitterness of comparison.

4024,"2011-01-12",4.0,"Got a sixer of this in a trade with slater1313. Poured into a pint glass.

4.5 A: Clear orange amber. Two fingers of dense head with good retention and plenty of lacing.

4.5 S: Lots of raw hop aroma. Citrus and floral in nature, the hops block out most of the malt character, but there still is a bit of fruitiness to it.

4.0 T: Lots of hop flavor now. It actually tastes like Im drinking liquified hops (though not mindblowingly intense). I guess what distinguishes this from an IPA is that, for as much hop content there is, there is relatively little bitterness compared to the total amount of hops used. Anyway, this beer is mildly bitter with citric and mild piney hop flavor. Malt character takes a background seat to the hop flavor. This beer is pretty damn good, but it lacks some complexity from the malt perspective. Malts lend a pinch of fruitiness and there is definitely some crystal malt present.

3.5 M: Medium body and a little lighter than I think it should be. Very smooth, but slightly undercarbonated.

4.5 D: I can deal without the complexity in the malts because the hops taste so damn good. Therefore, this beer is extremely drinkable.

4024,"2010-11-17",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2010 12 oz bottle purchased at a liquor store whose name I cant remember near my hotel in Indianapolis. This was the quarry that got me the most excited about my trip to the Hoosier State, and - while the bottles I found are rather forlorn and probably none too fresh - they live up to the brewers reputation. This poured a deep amber, as best I could tell in the opaque paper cups at the Super 8 (more money for beer!), and managed to lace even this meager, disposable excuse for glassware. The aroma of fresh, almost wet hops pervaded my nose even before I poured the beer, though, and carried on into the flavor where it interacted nicely with a strong, toasty malt profile. At various points, this tasted like a standard APA, an IPA, and an Oktoberfest, which is to say that it was surprisingly complex for such a sessionable apa. Its reputation appears both well-deserved and assured of continuation. UPDATE: I had a couple of more from the 6 pack tonight and - though still disappointingly stale - they are certainly richer and more complex than I credited last night.

Beautiful white foam that sticks all over the glass and leaves arguably the nicest lacing Ive ever seen.

The taste follows up on these fruity flavors but still has a nice slightly sweet malt component of caramel that really helps cut some of the bitterness in the finish.  This beer is full of crazy, delicious flavors and feels wonderful in the mouth.

Flavor reminds me a bit of the Green Flash West Coast IPA.  Very good beer.  As far as the style goes, I prefer the Hair of the Dog Ruth, which, although it is a pale ale, is remarkably different.

Not much different than 3F pride and joy in my book--just a little more hoppy.  Everything about this beer is nice.  Nice nose, nice little head, beautiful amber color, nice hop on the front to mid palate that doesnt linger like most IPAs that are a bit bigger.

Very cool looking bottle with the king himself featured on the front. The beer poured a dark orange with a very good head. The smell was so amazing. fresh hops permeated my nose and reminded me of grass, herbs, and flowers. The taste matched up very nicely with hops really shining through. Wow, believe the hype! I think this was better than dreadnaught. This probably ties with Deschutes Hop Trip for my favorite Pale Ale. Outstanding.

4024,"2010-01-04",4.1,"Reddish amber color, slightly hazy. A rather big off-white head dissipates quite fast and leaves some chunky lacings.

Big hop character in the nose - grapefruit, mango, lemon peel. Grass, pine-needles and hop resins. Plenty of malt as well. Some fudge, chocolate and rye bread. Very nice smell.

Despite massive hop flavors, the taste seems balanced. Exotic fruits (grapefruits, mango), solid backbone of sweet, caramel-like and nutty malts. Some bready notes. Floral hop flavors, resins and grass. A very fresh hop character overall, great! Perhaps a gentle note of chocolate. The bitterness in the finish is quite big, but manageable. Lingering notes of juicy malts and more hop resins.

M: Medium body, very crisp, slightly dry in the finish.

D: A quite astonishing APA. Considering the amount of hop aromas and flavors in this one, it could easily go head to head with an IPA. And despite all of the hops, it still feels well balanced.

The best APA by far.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"

Serious pine-oil hop aroma. Bitter but also flowery sweet. Really perfect. West Coast hops are sweet smelling and inviting. Perfect sweet-bitter balance.

Major blast of bitter, woody hops and a splash of alcohol. A little burn on the way down. Very strong. Hop flavor is sweet at first, then bitter. Slaps with the bitter, but mellows out at the end.

With that said, it would probaly be one of the best IPAs as well.  The aroma is full to the max.  Very much full of very oily super hops, presumably classic Oregon/Washington styles - hops ranging from Cascade to the extreme Warrior hops.  Citrus and alcohol is also present.  Alcohol aromas are definitively dominant with bourbon oakiness.  The appearance is a very deep coppery color, with a somewhat dissappointing head, white collar is all that is present.  The flavor is full of intense Pacific Northwest hops, that are very well balanced by complimentary malts with an alcohol burn.

How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed very fresh a few days after I received it from shawnm213.  Thanks a lot Shawn.
The look: Clear golden-copper body topped by a medium beige head
In long: The very aromatic nose blends pine-tree and citrus fruits.  A solid malt base with sugary caramel.  Sweetness is not bothersome but I found it a little sugary instead of being round and rich.  Hops are the main attraction.  The line between an APA and an american IPA is often a big gray zone but this one is definitely bigger, more intense and more bitter than 80% of the American IPAs.  APA ok if you say so.  A sharp and very bitter dry finish that contrasts with the sweet sugary malt backbone.  This is not a refreshing highly drinkable APA.

This is now available at my nearest Liquor Barn (Jefferson Commons). Aroma: Nice strong Cascade/Centennial bouquet, but also a rather old-school caramel malt balance. Appearance: Rich, copper pour with soft carbonation holding up a solid light tan cap that settles into a thick skin. Flavor: Balanced initially, but citrus comes out a bit more midway through, leading to a bitter, citrusy finish which still carries some malt sweetness. Palate: Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, bittersweet finish. Overall: There was a time when I considered this a ""desert island"" beer, one that Id always want to have close at hand. In 2015, its epoch has passed. That being said, its one of the most noteworthy, and extant, examples of APA from its time... a bit of a time machine in a bottle.

The beer tasted of hops without an overwhelming bitterness associated with it.  Just an awesome melding of hop and malt flavors as the beer warms, an awesome balance to this beer.

Tastes like an IPA but without the bitterness (its still quite bitter, however). Like their Gumballhead, this beer is heavily hopped for flavor and aroma. Quite possibly the best Pale Ale Ive ever had, it perfeclty captures the essence of the style. Theres enough malt to back up the hops and the intensity almost cloys at your mouth as it lingers on.

This just smells like a bag of fresh hops, some citrus, some floral notes. But mostly like when I open a bag of Cenntennial hops when I am homebrewing. This looks nice as well a very clear but attractive amber color with a big rocky head that sticks around and leaves plenty of lace. The flavor is even more complex than I remember it being! Plenty of citrus, but not just grapefruit there is some orange in there as well.

4024,"2008-09-18",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2008 I haven’t rated this yet!?!?!?! Lucky I just recently got a hold of another bottle. Amber colored beer with a fairly large slightly off-white head. The aroma is super citrusy with grapefruit being the numba one stunna. This is the quintessential american pale ale. Hops are prevalent and very citrusy but the pine tree back bone holds it together. An example of how a brewer using just the right amount of malt can transform something bitter into something that tastes like adult candy. AWESOME.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
4024,"2008-09-16",3.6,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Pour produced an red-amber body topped by an off-white head of foam.  Aroma is fantastic: strong floral notes with hops making a strong presence, along with some citrus.  This ale is bitter, in keeping with the style, favoring the hops in its palate.  The finish is dry with only moderate hops aftertaste.  I dont know if this is the best pale ale I have had, though it certainly isnt bad by a long shot.  I would have to try this again against other pale ales and see how this stacks up...","Plainfield, Illinois, USA","popephred"
4024,"2008-09-13",4.3,"12 oz bottle. Pours an almost clear amber orangr copper color with a thin white head that leaves little lacing. Aroma is a spicy citrusy hoppy nose with notes of grass and sweet bread in the background. Flavor is similar with the citrus and spiceyness, yet the earth tones are much more than grass with a long lingering dry bitterfinish. This pale goes above and beyond. I’d almost call it an IPA, either way a damn fine beer.","Greenwood, Indiana, USA","johntreeter"
4024,"2008-09-13",3.9,"Appearance is a clear amber-dark orange hue, head is a thick off-white layer of sudsy foam that dissipates to a thin ring, spotty lacing on the glass.

Smell is mild-to-moderate hops, mostly light citrus, pine resin, and floral/grass, nice backbone of bread/biscuit malts, touches of fruit zest and spices.

Taste is floral and earthy hops held in check with pale bread malts, great balance, some bitter citrus and roast malts creep in, finish dominated by bitter hops, very delicious.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, watery yet slick texture, mild carbonation.

I really like the balance between hops and malts, this is a very hop-forward pale ale in the session range with very little alcohol presence.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

Beautiful dark amber hue with sufficient lacing.  Certainly smelled and tasted like an IPA, but I can understand the pale ale classification.  You can tell there’s a ton of cascade and centennial on the back end of the boil, providing huge amounts of hop flavor, not commonly found in a APA.

Very lightly hazed golden hue, with a large and lasting eggshell colored head. Retention and lace are both very good.
Hop dominated aroma, grassy dry hop character, pine, classic citrus, tropical fruit. Low esters (but noticeable). Very low malt character, delicious aroma. 
Flavors are hop centric and quite bitter for an APA (alcohol is also quite high for what one would expect from an APA). Citrus, pine, grassy, tropical fruit, resin. Malt barely peeks through.

Hops fight back with a fist of resin-filled cones and a bough of pine. Light acerbic quality. Heavily grasses. Hop flavor is rather complex as well. A bit of that FFF soapiness climbs through the hops and malt to scent my nostrils in the alcohol flow. I cant decide if thats okay. Medium-bodied.

4024,"2008-05-09",4.1,"Sweet malty body, nice deep amber color. The hops arent as pronounced as some other pale ales. A strong example of a pale ale that doesnt need an overwhelming hop presence.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"
4024,"2008-05-09",4.1,"I picked this up today and while it doesnt have a date on it, the bottle of Gumballhead beside was dated 2003, so its a good chance this is also from that year.  The hop aroma has mellowed considerably and a sweet malty backbone is showing itself now.  Good head with large bubbles.  The hop flavor is exceptionaly well balanced.  A truly wonderful APA.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"
4024,"2008-05-06",4.1,"Bottle poured deep amber, quickly dissapating head, and excellent lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, hoppy, some bread, citrus, spice, and some sweet malt. The taste is an amazing balance of the aroma, hops, and smooth aftertaste that leaves your mouth tingling.

4024,"2008-05-04",4.0,"Bottle and Tap at FFF.  Sweet, strong hop aroma.  Pours a clear orange with a small white head.  Flavor is strong of Centennial hops.  Smooth and easy to drink but almost closer to an IPA because of the hop characters.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","CaptBier"
4024,"2008-05-04",4.2,"Bottle opened by owner of Oldsmar Tap House (Florida). Pours a golden amber color with a thin white head that gracefully laces the glass.

4024,"2008-05-01",3.8,"Amber pour with a soapy white head.  Hoppy aroma. Flavor is up front hops with a nice malt balance,  some citrus.  Finishes mildly bitter,  very drinkable.  I miss you alpha king,  come back to iowa city some day please.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
4024,"2008-04-30",3.9,"Thanks again to Haslinger for bringing along this brew.  Pour was medium golden with white head.  Aroma was real hoppy accompanied by some malt.

4024,"2008-04-30",4.2,"Deep red brown pour with a thing white head.  Clear with lots of carbonation and nice lacing.  Really intense aroma of floral hops and lots of fruit - grapefruit and citrus.  Great flavor.  A touch of sweetness and lots of hops and citrus.  A touch of malt and alcohol and a piny dry hop aftertaste.  Very very good!","Seattle, Washington, USA","EricE"
4024,"2008-04-29",4.1,"Pours a clear deep copper with a small bubbly head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. A few bubbles sit out on the top for the duration of the session.  A big floral, citrus hoppy aroma dominated by grapefruit and pine. Nice sweet malty aroma in the background to balance this out.  Just as in the smell, the taste is dominated by the huge floral and citrus hops - orange, grapefruit, pine, etc. Despite the big hop profile, the balance in the taste is provide by the subtle sweet malts that take over after the initial hop blast.  Medium bodied, creamy with a perfect moderate carbonation that just tickled the tongue. Not too sticky but definitely syrupy sweet with the perfect hop bitterness contrast.  This would be a staple in my fridge if I had access to it. It is an extremely drinkable APA and I could drink a few of these in a sitting. Highly recommended!","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
4024,"2008-04-28",4.2,"Tapped at Dark Lord Day 2008. Began the day with the flagship and was very impressed. Full orange body with white head.

Excellent beer would buy again.","The World of Beer, Texas, USA","Haslinger"
4024,"2008-04-26",4.1,"A- Pours a deep, sunset orange with a small head.

S- Smell is absolutely perfect. Sweet, floral tones with a huge aromatic pineyness.

T- Taste is milder than expected from the ipaesque nose but good none the less. Starts off with a huge hit of piney hop flavor but mellows quickly into sweet maltiness and very little if any hop bitterness.

M- Creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Theres something different about the three floyds mouthfeel that I cant put my finger on. At first with Dreadnaught I thought it was lack of carbonation but now im thinking it may be to creamy for a pale ale or ipa.

D- This would be an absolutely excellent session beer. One of my favorite pale ales to date. Has all of the hop flavor but none of the bitterness which makes it pretty drinkable.","California, USA","Lothore"
4024,"2008-04-25",4.5,"Are we sure this isnt an IPA? OMFG this stuff is gold. On tap at FFF. Poured a frothy copper with a strong dank floral and piney aroma.

4024,"2008-04-20",4.3,"Bottle. Pours a nice copper. Fantastic floral hop aroma which to me was strong like an IPA, but the flavor is much more balanced and complex. Really like this beer. Wish I could find it in California...","Sacramento, California, USA","Skeets"

Very floral hops pound the nose right away. Citrus and pine, too. Nothing like a big hoppy APA. Hops are powerful in the flavor, too, with citrus. A malty background balances the beer perfectly.

Definitely not a top choice.","Terre Haute, Indiana, USA","entropy666"

Very impressive pour with murky brown appearance and nice carbonation throughout.  Very strong citrus hard to believe this is classified as an american pale with the citrus hoppy notes.  Man it goes down smooth, nice mouthfeel for a pale, citrus and hops throughout but not too much.  I didnt expect the 6% to be noticible and it wasnt.

The taste was grapefruit hops and sweet caramel malt.  This is not your west coast-type of APA/IPA that is clear amber with tons of hops.

Mouth feel is incredible, creamy and rich with the perfect amount of carbonation.  There is no unpleasant aftertaste.  This beer is rich and interesting, but also makes a great session brew.

Beautiful copper color with a very small head and some decent carbonation.

Smells faintly hoppy with a nice solid maltiness to it.

The hops are actually pretty subtle in this...at first.  Its on the finish when they really shine through.  They really seem to take off on the finish and linger around for a long, long time... very well done.

4024,"2007-12-23",4.6,"Pours a dark copper color with a nice off-white head leaving lacing all the way down the glass. Starts off citrusy in the nose, but then hits you with a floral bouquet that seems never ending and always changing. I also noticed grapefruit as others have mentioned, there is also a slight maltiness in the nose, but hardly noticeable. On to the taste, the grapefruit taste came in strong, slight caramel for a second, but finishes with a lemon zest, a hint of pine is present throughout entire taste. Medium bodied and average carbonation level, pretty slick. Just a flat out good beer here, one of my favorites to keep around. Use caution with this one, once having one of these, you will not be able to taste much else in a beer until the following day.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

4024,"2007-12-18",3.6,"12oz bottle, courtesy of Stine. Pours a dark mahogany blended with amber, and is topped by a small off white head. Almost light brown in appearance, and little to no retention. Does leave a layer of foam and an edging of bubbles though. A very pathetic attempt at lacing is made. Nose of bitter citric hops, caramel and toffee malts, grass clippings and pine resin. Doesnt break any boundaries in regards to the flavor profile, but still very tasty. Hops, oranges, lemons and pine nuts all vie for attention, with the hops winning in the end. A nice sweet malt backing is present in each sip, helping to even everything out. Tastes to me more like an IPA than an APA, but I dont know enough about that kind of stuff to say for sure. Oily, slick mouthfeel. Slides right off the tongue into the back of the throat. Finishes with a bright green hop kick, backed by citrus fruit and then ultimately sweet malts.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

Big old resinous hop aroma, notes of pine and floral, with some citrus.  This could be one of the best beers ever.  Good malt start, backbone if you will, then a huge dose of citrus and floral hops.

A walk through deep pine forests, one inhales and a bitter menthol type aroma but instead of cool and mellow like a pine forest... one is transported to a remote island, grapefruit is growing from the pine trees. You take a taste, sweet, sour, piney, herbal. This brew will cure what ales ya!

4024,"2007-10-19",3.8,"Nice looking pour with bubbly head.   Very citrusy (in particular grapefruit) aroma screams HOPS at you without even taking a sip.  Flavor is very strong hops from beginning to finish.  Some light caramel malts try to stand up to the intense hops, but didnt have quite enough backbone to stand up; flavor was enjoyable nevertheless.  Bitterness lasts long after the drink is over.  This beer was incredible on the palate...unlike any other Pale Ale Ive ever consumed.  I would consider this a very good drink, but not excellent (but Im not really a true hophead).

4024,"2007-10-19",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2009 I have the honor of entering the 1000th rating of this highly regarded American pale. Bottle purchased at Crown #15 in Fishers, IN. It pours a deep copper with a few floaties and a thin, creamy, beige head that leaves behind patchy lacing. The nose is sublime: a perfect balance of big citrus, light pine and earthy hops along with a solid, sweet malt backing that smells of candy sugar. Quite nice. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and slick with a controlled bitter hop finish. The flavor is big piny, citric and resinous hops along with a solid, moderately sweet malt backing. While lingeringly bitter at the finish, the malt backing is such a perfect match that the balance of flavors is seamless. This is an amazingly flavorful beer for one so quaffable. Each sip compels you to take another. I can see myself drinking these one after another until I go blind, pass out, or see God. If I lived in Indiana or the Chicagoland area, this would be, without question, my staple beer.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

Malt and fruity (grapefruit and something else) hops blend nicely in the aroma. Also, a small amount of spice appears as it warms. Fruitiness was more pronounced when cold, but as it warmed the caramel malt took control up front yielding to the grapefruit hops towards the end.  The finish is citrusy and bitter. My first Three Floyds product, and it was very well done, especially the mouthfeel which is amazingly thick.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

Aroma is wonderful, very fruity with grapefruit and lychee with some slight floral notes too.  As it warms however, a spice-like character develops and complements the fruity aroma.  The taste is amazing, very fruity initially, somewhat like an ambrosia salad, with a lot of pineapple in the forefront with lingering hop bitterness that lasts forever.  Upon warming caramel is thrown into the mix, and perfectly complements the fruity flavors.  The mouthfeel on this beer is great, thick and chewy, by far the thickest APA Ive ever had.

A few drops of honey and lemon add complexity to the nose, as does a slight hint of cooling mint. The aroma is very unique and inviting.  The flavor has a very light caramel base.  Fresh orange juice and hops of seemingly every variety add pleasing contrasts and depth.  Honey and cream add smoothing elements.  Its not overly hoppy, but well balanced, complex and subtle.

Smell is huge bold hops, citrusy, and fruity sweet caramel and is just mouthwatering.  Taste is very nicely hopped, but not overdone at all.

The color is a gorgeous, hazy medium amber.  The aroma wafting upwards is one of resinous, grassy, slightly herbaceous hops, perhaps a touch of citrus thrown in for good measure.  Flavor is a slighted toasted malt, with some of that citric quality coming through.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"

4024,"2007-09-22",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. Aroma dominated by soapy yeast and herbal hops smells. Piney, dry aroma with a hint of lime, reminiscent of a gin and tonic. Cookie character develops in the aroma as I sip. Pleasant smell but not as strong as I expected. Pours a hazy amber/light brown with a gold hue and small amount of bubbling. Moderate to large amount of thick, cream-colored head. Produces nice lacing. Dry hops dominate the taste at first. The malts are surprisingly sweet though hard to notice at first because they are overwhelmed by the hops. Initially, I found this beer very poorly balanced, but as I continued to sip, I got past the hops shock, and the underlying biscuity malt qualities emerged, with welcome flavors reminiscent of peanut brittle and peanut butter cookies. My flavor rating on the early sips would have been a 5 or 6, while my rating on the later sips would have been 8 or 9. Ill compromise with a 7. Long, strong, bitter aftertaste. Medium to full body. Creamy and a little oily in the palate. Easy to drink. I used to love this beer when I drank it in college. This is the first time Ive had it in about three years. It doesnt blow me away like it used to, but I still consider it a good beer. While far too strong to qualify as a session beer, this is the sort of brew that stands up very well to multiple sips. If I had three of these in a row and rated only the third, Im sure Id rate it higher than a 3.7.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Aroma is hops, pine needles, citrus (mostly grapefruit), honey, and general foral-ness.  Mouthfeel is dry, medium-to-full bodied, Flavor starts out hoppy, then slightly sweet and then to bitterness with dry finish and aftertaste.

4024,"2007-08-15",3.8,"Very pretty amber and bright orange pour. Wild visible carbonation forms a well retained head, frothy and off-white in color. Lacing is thick and everywhere. The nose is loaded with Cascade hops, grapefruit galore. The grapefruit is only the beginnning however, as the aroma segues into a complex array of orange, spice, caramel, toasted grains, honey, flowers, tangerine and mango. This really gives me the impression its nearing aromatic capacity for the amount of liquid present. The flavor is very well balanced, with sweet malts nicely tamed by explosive bitterness and moderate acidity. A strange, mineralic, hard water composite floats around in each sip. Fruit is plentiful and varies nicely with each interpretive/contemplative swallow. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, well carbonated and pretty smooth, but its also quite dull. I suppose that translates to an easily sessionable quaffer, but it interests my palate and stimulates my senses very little. I prefer a new world pilsner with these qualities for a session beer. The finish is aromatic, lightly warming, of admirable duration, with grapefruit acidity and floral and caramel notes lingering. Very nice, nothing amazing.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Here I am, I consider myself a true hop lover, especially of IPAs.  I finally got my hands onto a 3 Floyds Alpha King beer.  Yes, I know, they say it s a ""Pale Ale"".  Yeah sure, what ever you say.  I have read about it, longed for it.  And now I have it!  It poured dark amber out of the 12 oz bottle into a shaker glass.  Forms a nice frothy foamy, head.  Aroma is of pine resins, a bit of grapefruits, malts.  This beer screams like a horny girl friend, ""fuck me baby, fuck me"".  At last I take a gulp, Ah......strong pines, caramel malts and a bit of citrus.  It bucks backs, demanding more with each thrust...I take another drink.....Its unbelievable  Better than the dream.....one realizes as each stroke that its better than the one before.  This is truly a wonderful beer.  A pale ale? Ah no, I promise you.  Lovers of IPAs, behold, 3Fs has done it.  I feel lucky, now leave me alone so I can finish her off, now its my turn.....

12 oz bottle sent to me by my 2009 winter Secret Santa. Pour is ever so slight orange copper with a one inch slightly off white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is fresh and full citrus, tangerine orange and pineapple along with a nice toasty mild caramel malt. Leans towards the hops, but still nice balance. Really nice nose. Taste is the pineapple citrus, with orange followed closely behind by the caramel malt. Also a nice straw pine mineral thing going on as well. Balanced, nice, but not quite as integrated as the nose. Palate is thin to medium, bordering on watery. Touch below average carbonation - easy drinking. The finish has the mineral, and a b it of an odd ashy taste. Nice as always, thanks Santa (9,4,7,3,16 - 3.9)

4024,"2007-07-17",4.1,"Draft into shaker, Clark St Ale House (Chicago).  I cant believe Ive never rated this; it has been a staple since I started drinking good beer six years ago.  Hazy, pretty much opaque red-orange in the glass with a creamy beige head that reminds me of Newcastle (which is not good in my opinion, but oh well).  Leaves a thick, very sticky layer of striated lace up the side.  Smooth on the first sip, the head feathering the mouth and letting the medium-bodied beer fill the mouth with a crisp, low carbonation feel.  Malts really set this apart from other beers of the style, even though hops are a defining characteristic of APAs: sourdough bread with big, juicy, beefy tomatoes and grapefruit (maybe I should try that in a sandwich).  The finish is perfectly bitter, though somewhat metallic, hops goodness lingering on the tongue for full minutes (and a citric hop quality lingering underneath that for just as long).  Although it is maltier and just generally stronger than Sierra Nevada, Im always reminded of that beer in the hoppy finish (quite an homage; a copyright lawyer would say this is a derivative work).  The smell belies the balanced nature of the beer, between the malts and the piney hops.  This beer is the troof, and is a session favorite of mine.  It has held up all these years.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

This is a constant in my fridge. Looking around on BeerAdvocate today I noticed I never took the time to review it. Here it is. 

Alpha King poured a slightly chill hazed dirty copper. A 2 finger white creamy head formed on an aggressive pour. Very few, slowly rising carbonation bubbles rise to the head. Leaves some patchy lacing.

I love the smell of a fresh Alpha King. Big piney hops that make my eyes and mouth water along with a squeeze of orange juice. A solid caramel maltiness in the background, just enough so the hops dont run wild.

This beer is considered a pale ale but drinks more along the lines of an IPA. Caramel maltiness starts things off and is quickly taken of by a strong pine needle mouth puckering hoppiness that lingers through till the finish. The finish is even a little more bitter as the caramel sweetness disappears. 

Body is on the lighter side of medium. Sluggish carbonation lets the brew work its way through at its own pace. Hop bitterness gives the tongue a beating.

This is an incredibly easy drinking beer. Every sip makes you want another. The lighter body makes it easy on the stomach.

The best pale ale I have yet come across. It helps that its more along the lines of an IPA. An absolute classic and one of my favorites.

4024,"2007-05-22",5.0,"bottle pours a mahogany haze with amber tendencies.  the head here is subtly dense, and ever-so-slowly receding.  the strong scents of thick hops are similar to that of a dense fog, and are accented by the flavorful citric aromas crossed with notes of creamy caramel slightly toasted malts.  tastes?  liquid perfection.  i cant state it any better.  it coats the palate from the front, with bright and lively warrior hops and slight spice, to the back where the thicker mouthfeel really shines and is accented by the mild, but non-offensive bitterness and slight salt flavor.  this is great.  all kinds of complexity here.  its just sad that theres only 12 oz, and i cant get it here.","Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA","andyhite"

Aroma is very nice with plenty of grapefruit, citrus and flowers swirling around with some brown sugar and light caramel background.  Taste is pretty much like that as well.  Some light brown sugar, bread and caramel for the malt taste, but theres tons of hop flavor and its very floral and grapefruity.  Finish has some butterscotch and earthy hop flavor, but not much actual bitterness.  This is incredibly good!  This is a creamy medium bodied (full for the style) very smooth beer.  Slightly sticky, but whatever.  Thanks to Peter for this bottle.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

4024,"2007-05-17",4.9,"Simply a perfect beer here. The beer has so much hops, and such a unique taste to it that it truly does make the hoppyness apear to be floral. I wanted to save a rainforest when I first tried this beer because it was so life changing, but then I had a six pack and ran into a tree, so, I gave it a 19 overall instead of a 20.

A great beer though!","USA","Driftwood6"

4024,"2007-05-09",3.5,"Born on date- who the hell knows? Pours out a cloudy copper with minimal head - some soapy lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about- some fading hops. Taste- quite spritzy which surprised me given the lack of head. Grassy hops with a soapy aftertaste. Malt is solid- tobacco and solid caramel flavours. Its quite tasty, but doesnt blow me away. Maybe its the age- I cant imagine I have a bottle at its peak of freshness. First time trying, so I risked the purchase in my excitement not knowing its age. The hops are there, just in weird muted kind of way. given the rep of FFF, I was expecting more. Truthfully, pass the SNPA, as this pale ale doesnt match the benchmark classic american pale that is Sierra Nevada. I would love a chance to try fresh on tap or bottle.

Orange rind, fresh grapefruit, spring florals and multiple layers of piney hops. Full and complete. However, while the beer was crisp and refreshing, it was missing some oomph.

4024,"2007-04-19",3.9,"Bottle.  Ahh! The menacing Alpha King rides again!!  Now, theres 12 

ounces of hoppy goodness if I ever saw it.  Pours a nice amber color, 

perhaps a shade lighter than iced tea.  Pour is hazy, owing to the fact 

that this is a bottle conditioned ale.  Makes a nice, fat, foamy head 

with moderate lacing.  Kind of looks like an egg fried in an overly hot 

skillet.  Once the head has calmed down a little, and when viewed in the 

right light, the remaining trace of head appears almost to have a green 

tinge to it.  Could it be that the boys at Three Floyds crammed so much 

hops into this recipe that the head actually takes on a green hue?  

Nah...must just be a trick of the light.  It is very hoppy, though, which 

characteristic lends itself to the long finish.  The hop bitterness 

dances on the tongue for a good 2 or 3 minutes after you take a quaff.  

This glass is not lasting long enough to warm very much, but I think 

warming a little releases the floral aroma of the hops.  That is what one 

smells when one sticks ones proboscis in the glass: hop flowers and 

alcohol.  It shares that quality with its cousin, Gumballhead.  My nephew 

put his nostril down to the neck of a freshly cracked bomber of 

Gumballhead, and the first thing he said was, ""It smells like incense.""  

If one sniffs hard enough while simultaneously searching the olfactory 

memory banks, the same can be said for this ale, though that quality is 

not as profound as it is with Gumballhead.  One can taste the quality, 

the care, the love that went into brewing this beer.  Overall, a smooth, 

superbly crafted and very drinkable Amerian Pale Ale.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","wheresbaldo"

Hazy & dark orange/amber with a decent head and good lacing. Aroma of a broad range of floral citrus hops, reminding of roses, grapefruit and the resin of pine trees.. Strong taste with complex hoppiness, and some sweet malt providing a backbone of toffee and caramel. Not so bitter at all, the bitterness is rather just a component of the complex multilayered taste, instead of the main element like in some more one-dimensional full-on tonguescorcher brews. Long & sticky finish that slowly dried out, leaving a great piney hopbitterness.

This beer pours a very attractive light nutty orange, with just enough sediment to give it a slight haze which I prefer (I also like Bells Two Hearted Ale, which is not fully filtered).  The nose on this beer is not to be neglected, its floral, citrus, piney, hoppy -- a treat.  This is not a thin clear pretender after thought of a beer, this is the real deal.  Thin head if poured correctly, but who cares?  The taste of this beer is smooth and creamy.  Mouthfeel is slightly thick, and lightly carbonated, bitter clean hoppy aftertaste.

What I hear about Dreadnaught is that thats VERY hoppy, so this is probably more of an APA for 3Fs. anyWHO,it is tasty, hoppy, citrusy good, I rated it high no matteer how its classfied, very nice brew.","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","incutrav"

Brief caramel malt in the first sip, then the hops take over. Tons of grapefruit and orange, with a little bit of pine tossed in for good measure. The caramel reappears in the finish with just a touch of light sweet licorice. More citrus hops (this time lemony) linger into the aftertste.

S: ...wonderful aroma emanating from this brew. Its all very subtle, yet enticing at once. Some floral aroma, a nice pink grapefruit and certainly some piney smells.

T: Wow. Just, wow. Seriously, this beer disappeared so quickly, the flavors are just complex enough, and just subtle enough that its damned near chuggable. There is without a doubt a gorgeous piney overtone to the beer (from the Centennial hops?) as well as some wonderful malted undertones. Utterly delicious. I could drink this all night.

M: Again, just nothing at all wrong with this beer. It feels ""right"" in your mouth and bigger than usual gulps are real easy, too easy in fact.

Resiny, citric hops lead the nose. Caramelly, bready malt lies underneath providing more than ample support. Excellent balance, and complexity. Very nice indeed.

Even better in the mouth, where a medium body conveys that magic FFF juicy hop flavor. Again, there is excellent balance between the big maltiness and even bigger hop load. Finishes with a long, lingering hop bitterness. Major league.

Mild, extremely fine carbonation from the bottle conditioning gives a lush mouthfeel. Liquid velvet. Perilously drinkable. Amazingly this is probably my third favorite of the regular FFF line-up, but that speaks to the quality of Pride & Joy and Robert the Bruce rather than to any problems with this beer.

Smell is less like familiar hop bitterness than it is like pure citrus-ness.  Given the very dark appearance of this beer, the smell is much lighter than I wouldve guessed.  

The taste is extremely good.  Full and sweet up front, with citrus note throughout the finish.  This beer is very apparently bitter, but not in an intimidating or challenging way.

Dominant pine needle aroma, with some background notes of sweet citrus, both sweet and toasted malts, and even a bit of yeastiness. In the mouth, there is more pine, but more reminiscent of the wood itself as opposed to the fragrant needles. The citrus notes become more distinctive and remind me of tangerine, mandarin orange, and grapefruit. The hop flavors are substantial, but their sharpness is blunted by the equally assertive malt presence. The bitterness is about on par with the style, which is somewhat of a disappointment considering the name of the beer. Overall, this is a very well executed beer, but not the mind blowing, mouth-puckering experience I was hoping for.

Sampled this multiple times at the great american beer festival (definitely sampled it enough to warrant a review). Very strong hop flavor and aroma, nice hop resins present.

4024,"2006-09-30",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 A brewery has to be mighty confident to name one of its own beers with a compound of two flattering titles.  King suggests a monarchial patriarch steeped, thanks to the popularity of democracy, in mystique and mythology.  An ultimate if foolish authority - the highest form of legal impunity.  But then to borrow some equally alluring and scholarly Greek to legitimize the regal appellation with the language of the ancients  it shows no lack of gall, and a high risk of extreme gaucherie.  But they did it.  They made a beer entirely deserving of its name and more.  The more pale ales I drank at the GABF the more I realized its a style I dislike, but there were a handful that stood out.  They were the last bastions of quality in hops, and leading the pack was the Three Floyds Alpha King.  It was more than tolerable.  It was divine (gives a whole new meaning to divine right to rule).  Similar to the distantly related pale ales that sprawled across the festival floor like a plague of locusts, the Alpha King glowed brightly in a simple clear and gold garb topped with a thin laurel of off white foam.  Nothing extraordinary, but if the appearance was mundane then the aroma was exceptional.  The first smells to hit the olfactory are whipped cream and berries.  These punch into the nostrils, followed by the spine melting aromas of creamed honey, genuine ripe grapefruit, and a bouquet of wildflowers.  All of these heavenly, bellowing whiffs of dessert follow suit on the tongue, though taking an ancillary role tip-toeing on the palate behind bubbly and springy hops and floral qualities.  The key here is a balance.  Too many breweries think hopping up their beers and quantifying IBUs in scientific notation makes for an extreme experience.  And many drinkers think this is tantamount to a pleasing experience.  Since this is becoming the rule Ive progressively felt more and more ostracized from the pale ale community.  But the Alpha King, in his just and benevolent rule, has welcomed me back to a court where balance and focus make for the finest beer.  Its well textured, well flavored, well scented, well balanced and generally well made.  It is, in my mind, the finest pale ale available and justly deserves its eminent title.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Has that nice hoppy Amber Ale taste that stays somehwat subdued but hits the spot. I always have trouble with this style as far as discering flavors as they seem to meld together so well. I think i taste some orange, grapefurit and caramel malt with a nice crisp finish. But it blends together so well it is hard to discern individual flavors.

Medium sweet and heavily bitter - exceptionally balanced - with some buttery candy malt flavors appearing as the glass warms.  A very long, lightly sweet, heavily bitter, somewhat metallic finish.  Smooth and creamy, medium body, substantial carbonation.  To summarize, nothing is lacking in this beer.  It really does everything well.

4024,"2006-09-02",4.0,"355 ml. bottle.  Hazy orange.  Upon first sense of aroma I thought this was an India Pale Ale.  This is highly hopped.  If Im not wrong the Warror hop has high amounts of alpha acids and the Centennial is lower.  But this is where is must get part of its name, yes?  Bottle conditioned.  Finely crafted.  More on the grassy side than citrusy side for me.  Nice long lasting bittering finish.  No sweetness here.  I thought pale ales would try more of a balance between sweet and bitter...this is all hops...Im not complaining, but why is this not in an (American) India Pale Ale style?  Very good beer though.","Fox River Grove, Illinois, USA","TechMyst"
4024,"2006-08-29",4.2,"From 12oz Bottle.  Pours a deep amber color with some fiery tones of peach skin and a creamy serving of off-white head.  Deep breath - man, I love centennial hops.  A nice, mild fruity spiciness accompanies the fresh hop character.  Some silky layers of white peach and creamy vanilla toffee line up eagerly behind the saturation of white peppered ruby red grapefruit that kisses my nostrils gently.  The mouthfeel is actually a bit heavier than Id expect for the style, but its just so delicious I have to force myself to slow down and savor this one.  It is here that I discover this beers true genious.  It tastes like the aroma, but flawlessly - very fruity and very hoppy without being overly bitter and with a light, clean finish.  Im amazed at how much flavor and character is built into such a small, easy drinking package relative to the styles big brother peers.  Its like the jack-of-all-beers - fantastic as a sipper, perfect as a thirst quencher, and frighteningly easy drinking.  Marvelously done.  Thanks, Brandon!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

It has a very grassy aroma, very dry hop like, which you dont often smell from my experience.  I like it.

The flavor left me a little confused, as it tastes much lighter than it smells.. and gives you the same grassy, hoppy, light citrus & pine flavor.  I had hoped for more or different flavor, palate is a little watery, but this is a solid brew.

Lets compromise and contribute equally on the finish."" Something like that. Additionally, it really coats well in the mouth and the carbonation level is perfect for the style. Flavor seems to continue to pop off the tongue well after sipping. Overall, a very fine APA in my book.","San Diego, California, USA","bindpmc"

Really strong hop aromas for a pale ale. Malty body with strong hop bitterness. Slightly harsh notes, but the sweetness from the malt depth does hide most of these. This is a great pale ale.

Excellent Bottle. Pours pretty but unexceptional into a tall pilsner glass. Nice head, good retention. Light orange/amber.

Goodness, what a nice smell. Hoppy as a bunny rabbit along with a light floral hint. Its like a rosegarden, really, completely natural. Not fake flowers. Flowers. This is nice.

Strange as it may sound, it tastes pretty much like it smells: an insanely hoppy flower garden. Complex as hell. The hops are a little bit smaller upfront than in the back, the aftertaste is dry as can be and nice and bitter. Unique as hell. Hops and hops and sugar and a whole array of flavors that Ive never tasted before. Its like a Ricola losenge, those natural, flowery ones.

Bottle - Yknow its really amusing that this is their flagship beer. I mean, this is supposed to be the accessible, easy-drinkin session beer. This is indeed easy drinking for any beer enthusiast, but still with more than enough cajones to frighten fizzy-yellow-beer-drinkers. This is one of the finest examples of an APA I can reference. All the elements of tea, grass, pine, caramel come together perfectly in the most tasteful of proportions.

Bottle. It seemed a little more difficult to track down some Three Floyds on this trip to Chicago, but thankfully I was able to enjoy this bad boy again. This is the king of APAs. It has the perfect level of crystal malt sweetness  to provide some type of balance while the bright citrus, pine, and marijuana-like hops do their thing.  Awesome.

On tap. It has been way too long since Ive had a sample this fresh of Alpha King. Ive got a couple of bottles in my hotel room and as delicious as the first one was, it doesnt measure up to the pint I enjoyed earlier at Rich-Os. Taking a sniff effortlessly bombards my olfactories with aggressive, perfectly defined hop character. Loads of grapefruit and pine are all over the place with zesty, herbal hints in between. The malts are medium-sweet, really just an afterthought. The amount of hop character imparted on Alpha King is truly remarkable in both its strength and clarity, yet this semi-dry brew is notably sessionable.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Sweet floral hops were immediately detectable.  Theres some thin malt in there, but the sweetness smells like its coming from the hops, more like a sweet smelling flower than a beer.  Theres a little bit too much CO2 here, but not painfully so, and it provides a good frothy mouthfeel with a bit of thickness to it.

Pours a slighly hazy copper orange with a half finger yellowish white head--decent retention.  Also, there were a couple of floaties in this bottle, which Ive never seen out of my many many bottles of this stuff.  Aroma of pineapple, grapefruit, some pine needles, and caramel malts.  Smells hoppier than most APAs Ive had.  Caramel malts do seem a bit stronger in the flavor than the aroma, though the hops still shine--pineapple and grapefruit are up front, and some pine and floral hops linger in the background.  The caramel malts do a good job of giving the fruitiness of the hops a pleasant sweetness.  Semidry finish.  Bitterness doesnt creep up until the dry swallow after the  swallow of beer, and its around a 6 (out of 10).  Burps pine.  Low to moderate carbonation with a medium fairly creamy body.  Without looking, I think this is still my highest rated APA--one great thing about living in the Midwest.


Old rating follows.  12oz. bottle.  Pours a clear amber orange with a mod sized off-white head.  Aroma of grapefrtuit and piney hops, with a sweet caramel backbone.  Taste follows the aroma.

As the glass progresses, the marriage become a bit more civil and some pleasant underripe fruit flavors appear. Some winey tanic quality. A surprising amount of alcohol is noticable in the palate, distracting from what is otherwise a medium to light mouthfeel. Not sure what to make of this.

4024,"2006-03-08",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2008 After years of drinking the big buisness macros, i  am now trying real beers. From a New-B percpective this was nicely intence after putting in the freezer for a few minutes. Poured into a glass it looks like a brownish honey color with a very small offwhite head. Nice hoppy sweet smell and not over fuity like the highly rated Dreadnaught Imperial IPA. If your just graduating from the Bud-Coors lightstuff and this is your very first try at this beer, it may seem too intense. But after you have tried a few differenent beers i am sure you will find this very enjoyoble. Also very affordable. $6.99 a six pack in Pawtucket RI. *** Its been almost 2 years and i finially have a chance to try this beer again, ive come a long way in  my tastes and since discovered that im not really crazy about pale ales, but i still respect this one as one of the best. I also look forward to comparing it to the Dreadnaught which i will guess i will not like as much as this one, the King is much easier to drink and enjoy.","Pawtucket, Rhode Island, USA","Cryotek"

4024,"2006-03-03",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2007 I understand why this beer is rated so high, but it must not be my style because it was a little intense for me. I am still a newb at craft beer so maybe I will give this a try again in a few years. The aroma citrus and floral aroma was great I had never smelt a beer like this, but when i tasted it i felt like was sucking on flower petels. I think it was worth the deal of $1.79.

A nice grainy flavor and aroma. Nice hoppy flavor

4024,"2006-01-28",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2006 Ok heres a proper re-rate, Ive got a bottle to myself thanks to Blankboy.  Very deep dark brown orange, small white head.  What a colour.  Lots of hops, somewhat resiny, but more malt like in aroma.  Taste is excellent:  Sure lots of hops, but lots of bread like malt too.  Just about the best balanced and best example of and APA Ive ever had.  My rating holds, awesome stuff.

Sample.  Tons of malt and hops in aroma.  Golden orange, small white head, hazy.  More malt than hops in taste - incredibly balanced.  Some fruit hints as well, but this one is all malt, which is nice, as I was expecting a hop monster.  The fact that is 6% means I could drink this all night - what a session ale.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
4024,"2006-01-27",4.5,"Alpha King pours to a beautiful, bright, deep orange color with a rocky white head, and a lively carbonation. The nose is just bursting with waves of fresh, citrus hop aromas. Strong aromas of grapefruit and lemon flood the nose. The palate is a solid base of pale and caramel malts and touches of estery fruit. You really need some good malt character in a beer this hoppy, and I like the fact that this beer has enough malt to stand up to the huge hop character. This beer reminds me much of Victorys Hop Devil in that regard. The finish explodes into a long, dry, citrus hop bitterness that jack hammers the taste buds and peels the skin off your throat. 

Wow. This is one bracing, hoppy beer, in flavor and aroma, and bitterness. The bitterness is a touch harsh, but not a problem for a hop head. This beer is not for the timid, you have to really enjoy hop character and bitterness to enjoy this beer. A hop monster like this, goes so well with hot and spicy cuisine. I would match this beer with nuclear hot Buffalo wings, Thai or Indian curries, or Mexican dishes","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Spicy, floral/piney, and especially hoppy aroma is refreshing... Maybe hints of apple. Spicy flavor fills mouth with bitter hops and notes of pine. Nice bitter finish lingers. Alcohol is subdued but noticable. Malt characteristics barely noticable but present. Finishes very bitter but balanced by sweet malt presence.

VERY hoppy, with a strong malt backbone, AK is best (at least for me) paired with food to ""wash it down"", as I dislike the extremely hoppy aftertaste.  This is going against the grain of my Great Divide Titan IPA review, which was glowing, but I prefer the Titan due to its dryness.  Theres a sweetness in the background of AK that I cant get over.  Still, Alpha King is outstanding, but I prefer other pale ales.","Platteville, Wisconsin, USA","cperry8483"

Big hop aroma of pine and citrus so characteristic of Northwest hops. Mediu/full body with a rich malt feel that few APAs seem to achieve. Falvors of caramel and roasted grain take a back seat to the huge hop flavors, yet it doesnt seem unbalanced. Lingering, refreshing and astringent bitter finish. Ive been trying to get my hands on some of this for a while, and Im not disappointed. The best APA that Ive had, without question.

4024,"2005-12-25",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2006 Thanks Sliffy for two bottle of this one.  This is a very good IPA.  I feel like the reason it is so highly rated is because it is considered an APA.  Compared to other APAs this is extremely bold.  As an IPA, its good, but not as outstanding.  It reminds me of 60 min, SN Celebration and Harpoon IPA; all good beers.  On the the notes:  Smells like juicy grapefruit and pine needles.  Flavor is surprisingly malty at first, with a good sweetness coming from the fruity hips.  Powerful bitterness on the roof of the mouth in the finish.  Very well balanced.  A very good everyday beer.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

Fresh, carbonated presence on the tongue with citrus and malt up front, hops bringing up the rear with residual bitterness in the aftertaste.  Surprisingly hoppy considering the lack of same in the aroma.  Pretty strong hop taste, probably edging closer to an IPA.  Good all around balance.

Overall, an excellent American pale.  A good medium choice between the weaker hops of a typical APA and the overwhelming (to some) hop bitterness of an IPA, making an ideal session beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","julrey"

4024,"2005-10-31",3.6,"09-Nov-04 (12 oz bottles: Obtained in trade with marinaro500, thanks Joe!) A very flavor packed pale ale, quite malty, moderately sweet, with clear grapefruit hoppiness balancing the beer, or perhaps overbalancing it.  While Im enjoying this beer tremendously, it does seem overpowered by the grapefruit flavor, especially considering this is supposed to be an American pale ale.  Solid mouthfeel, medium body, clean finish.  Malty, but strong grapefruit aroma.  Dark amber in color, fairly cloudy.  Hardly any head, but the resulting sheen during the pour is off-white in color. (8, 4, 7, 4, 15, total: 3.8)01-Nov-05 Since I received two bottles of this beer in trade, I thought I see what the second bottle would be like after one year of aging.  Naturally, I expected the hops would drop off, leaving a really malty pale ale, which sounded pretty yummy to me.  But no, the grapefruity hops is still the dominant force, lending solid bitterness from start to finish.  Theres also a bit of tea in the flavor.  The nose is more balanced between a moderately earthy and toasty maltiness and grapefruity hops.  Medium bodied with a nice clean finish.  Dark amber in color and a bit hazy.  And this time, the off-white head rose to nearly an inch before gradually settling to a ring.  Pretty amazing how well the hops have held up on this beer.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Let it warm a bit and the hops still slap your tongue around but the sweet malt is much more noticeable and balances the hops nicely.

As it warms, the aroma gets a little lighter.  Drink this out of the fridge, and get ready for an assault on your palate.  Tons of dry hoppy goodness!  However, it goes through a wonderful transition somewhere around mid bottle.  The hops stick around, but the latecoming grapefruit, sweet citrus, honey and caramel make for a great party.

But Ive had this enough in the bottle and on tap, and my reactions have been fairly consistent. The beers appearance is much darker than I have come to expect from a pale ale or ipa, almost scotch ale in colour. Notes of caramel and vanilla on the nose and palate blended in with citrus from the profusion of hops. I think part of my qualm with this beer is calling it a pale ale when its quite a bit more hoppy than what some brewers label their ipa.

4024,"2005-06-22",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2006 Bottle.  Smells of pine, floral hops, and citrus.  Taste mimics the aroma .  Very intense hop flavor throughout.  No question that what little the caramel malt does its destroyed by the over the top amount of hops in this one.  More hop taste in this APA then some IPAs Ive head.  With that said I wish for a little more malt/hop balance in an APA.  My first from 3F.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"

Flavor is intensely but pleasantly bitter with excellent hop character but with sufficient caramely sweet malt backbone.  Some modest ester profile complements the flavor.  Slighty buscuity as well.  It is also quite full bodied and smooth.  I really think this beer should be classified as an IPA and pride and joy should be their american pale ale but thats just me.  I could drink this regularly.  A really excellent beer from an excellent brewery.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","BlueDevil0206"

Flavor is a little over dry in the hop area w/ a decent bitter finish a touch piney w/ its big hop flavor there are hints of the fruitiness i smelled as well.

4024,"2005-05-25",4.3,"Bottled.  Pours a deep orange color with a rapidly dissipating, rocky, white head, which leaves a thin layer of lacing on the top.  The aroma is almost completely dominated by floral American hops.  The [possibly?] Centennial and/or Columbus hops give this beer a fantastic floral, citrus, apricot, and slight pine aroma.  There is a faint malt-caramel aroma present as well, but, dont let me fool yah, this beer is all about the humulus!  The flavor is sweet up front.  Citrus-hop flavors are ascendant -- grapefruit with orange zest and maybe a little lemon.  The hops are supported with a strong troupe of malt character.  A touch of caramel, toasted, and maybe a little nutty flavors give great play with the hops.  Again, grapefruit is the dominant flavor.  The beer is fairly well balanced, and has average alcohol feel.  The brewer lists this is as a medium-bodied beer.  Which is probably correct, but relative to other PAs, this is most definitely full-bodied.  The finish is quite bitter, but not overwhelmingly so.  The aftertaste is quick, dry, and bitter with a bit of grassiness (perhaps from some dry-hopping).  There are no perceptible flaws in this beer; as, the intense hopping simply wont allow any, if they exist, to show through.  Overall, I thought this was an intensely flavored beer with incredible body, but was surprisingly drinkable.  The flavors and aroma are well organized.  I can see how it might be a little too intense, in flavor/bitterness/alcohol/body, to drink all night for some, but I still consider it a session.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","FooFaa"
4024,"2005-05-23",4.3,"Out of a bottle,  nice piney citrus aroma.  Dark amber color medium foamy white head that leaves thin layer on top.  Taste on the hoppy side but finishes fast and dry.

Plesent boardering on obnoxious (almost soappy?).  The appearance is great.  Nice amber colour topped with a big fluffy head which is gone pretty quickly.  NIce lacing throughout the glass.

4024,"2005-05-20",4.1,"Poured a reddish-amber with about a 1"" head that stayed quite well.  Aroma was of citrusy hops (lemon and grapefruit came to mind).  Beer was medium-bodied, and seemed to be highly carbonated (I think this was due to a very bad pour from the bartender).  The bitterness and the citrus flavors danced across the taste buds very well, with a light hoppy finish.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Pours a dark orange body, almost a reddish colour. Head is a foamy white, and thick. Aromas are hops like crazy, pine, citrus, malt. taste is lots of hops, but not overpowering, subtle citrus and some mild malt that balances it out nicely.

4024,"2005-05-08",4.0,"I poured it in and witnessed a lot of carbonation but the foam was short lived. It has a very hoppy aroma of a coppery nature. It is very well rounded as far as taste-it leaves a bitter impression on my tongue and throat but relaxes my senses through its intermingling of hops and malts. This is definately what one wants from a bitter. Im not sure the extra alcohol content is necessary to accentuate the taste though.

4024,"2005-03-30",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2006 Let me start by saying that I liked this beer but, because it is a Pale Ale, I found it very difficult to rate.  That said......   It pours a clear dark copper with a medium sized, rocky eggshell white head.  With my eyes closed, my nose told me I had just poured an IPA due to the bountiful floral, citrusy grapefruit & hoppy aroma.  Keeping my eyes closed, my tongue would have confirmed the noses conclusion that an IPA was escaping the glass.  Hop bitterness up front with citrus fruit, vanilla and malt sweetness not too far behind.  Finish was dry, bitter and refreshing.  Mouthfeel was - well, heres where the problem of rating this beer became a challenge - mouthfeel was very thin for an IPA but appropriatly light for a PA.  All in all, almost everything about this beer screamed IPA and thats great - for an IPA.  I love IPAs but I dont always want one.  If I want a Pale Ale, I expect it to have the flavor & palate profiles of a PAle Ale - not of an IPA - and thats where I think this beer falls short.  Dont get me wrong - I like it and Id gladly drink it again but Im putting them on the IPA shelf because thats what it is - a tasty Pale with an identity crisis.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"

4024,"2005-02-02",3.6,"This is a good beer, but if its really in the top 1 percentile of beers, theyve changed something since I used to buy this stuff as my regular ""drinking beer"" a mile from the brewery when I lived in Whiting, Indiana four years ago.  At that time, they were a tiny outfit brewing their beers in a non-descript warehouse in Hammond, IN (they didnt even have a sign on the building!).  I think they have since moved to new digs.  I used to buy it because it was brewed locally, was very hoppy (too hoppy for most), and wasnt terribly expensive, about 2 bucks more a case than my usual Sierra Nevada Pale ale.  Good stuff, but back then, underneath the high hoppy initial taste was a somewhat disappointing wateriness and lack of depth.  Like I said, they must have changed something to get these high ratings, and Id like to try it again today to see.  A memorable beer.","redlands, California, USA","hopmaster"

4024,"2005-01-27",3.2,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2005 An American/Indian pale ale?  I find it hard to consider this an pale ale when the description of their Dreadnaught is it is a step above their APA.  How can you go from an APA to an Imperial IPA.  The color is medium amber and a decent off-white head.  Strong pine/ citrus hop aroma and taste that comes off a little too medicinal for me, if not slippery.  Rather limp body.  A nice flavorful beer that I find a little lacking in the malts.  Lacks the body of SNPA and the smooth creaminess of Burning River, but I am sure the high hop profile will make most overlook this.","USA","kane"
4024,"2005-01-26",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2005 If I didnt know, and just poured and sniffed and looked at it, it would come off as an IPA.  (A plus, of course.)  Very good sign.  And it goes about as far as an APA can go.  (Actually, not even as far as Great Lakes Burning River does.)  Citrusy on the front, sweet on the finish, yadda yadda yadda.  I think its an inescapable feature of APAs: they present much like an IPA but theyre smoothed around the edges, finishing soft and, well, flat.  A lackluster orgasm that just ends with a kind of thud, emptiness, unintrusiveness, non-lingeringness.  Okay, maybe thats a bit harsh; after all, an APA can only be so much and a critics got to be a Bastard.  Its good stuff.  The sudsy sheen on top and lacing are real eye candy, like Stone IPA.

Aroma is big floral hops and a bit o honey.  There is some pineyness in the aroma as well. Nice aroma.  The taste is all hops. It tastes like you are chewing on a pine tree.  There are also some citrus rind flavors and some spicy ones as well. The flavor is almost completely hops driven, but the beer is not overly bitter.  The finish is dry and flavorful.

4024,"2005-01-03",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2005 My first experience with this beer was early in my career and it was on tap.  Since then, Ive been buying it by the sixer repeatedly, and each time I find that I want to bump up the rating.  Nevertheless, heres the ongoing compilation from the countless times Ive had the beer from both bottle and on tap...Color is a deep copper-amber with a nice head thats about 1/4"" thick with random bubbles breaking at the top.  Smells strongly of Amarillo, lemons, grapefruit, nectar, pineapple rung and pine with trace wafts of amaretto-meets-lemon grass.  Altogether, a very bright and awakening aroma.  Hits the palate and bliss instantaneously registers as remarkably crisp, satisfying and hoppy as Three Floyds can be  but, lets not go without saying that theres phenomenal malt sweetening at its regal center.  Welcome to Nick Floyds balance clinic, please take a seat.  Tingly grapefruit, papaya and pine resin accentuate that bitterness which is boding well - and reaching great distances - across the palate.  Perfumey and herbal complexities hint at freesia, lavender, snapdragons and lilies of the valley in liquefied form.  A small bite creeps-up at the end of each sip and leaves one of the best bitter remnants that an aftertaste could ask for.  Such a damn good beer by such an admirable brewery.  Well done, every time.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Notes of subtle apricot, brandy and an abundance of hops. Amariillos methinks.  Voluminously subtle and yet breathtakingly aromatic all at once.  All of these flavors translate into the palate. However they are not paled over by some rudely cantankerous tyrant malt, or hop or yeast. Much rather they lie down sweetly with one another and are committing indecent acts on my strongest muscle. These flavors come first. Next an ample hop punch cuts my cheeks in twain. Overwhelmingly bitter.

Mighty fine hopified wiffer for an aroma, highly sweet, softly resinous, calming citrus, slick pine, freshly floral; its got it all in the hop profile. Dreadnaughts little brother for a nose. A hop bouquet! Nicey nice. Yum.

Taste has a well rounded front, slight fruity malts with hop flavors of dulled citrusy stuff. Builds quickly from there with fresh floral tones, crisp yet green like a green bean, toasty just past midway, growing into lingering hop piney bitterness which is pretty full of good Ol alpha acids to fade off and squeeze out any sweetness remaining. Quite juicy and resinous with a favorable drying of bitterness. Some slight toffee eeks its way onto the sides of the cheeks super later.

Feel is clean, slick, quick the whole way through, about medium body, nearing more lighter due to its remarkable cleanness - calming and smooth in the front, wafting hoppy finish of refined bitterness and light drying for its back.

I tasted the same batch recently, and it (like many Ipas) has lost its hoppy ""edge"".

4024,"2004-05-04",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2004 When I was first introduced to this beer, I was warned that it wasnt for everyone, and at the very least took some getting used to, after all ""its not normal."" Id already had an affection for the hops, and, well, it was love at first sniff and sip. 
Years later, after the bloom of fresh infatuation has mellowed, how does the beer compare, especially after this tongue has met so many others, with abundant charms? That is what we seek to discover...
Perfect crimson-tinged nectarine hue, hazy, and blessed with a beautiful bed of froth up on top, leaving delicate lace, enticing the eye. Aroma makes matters worse for the thirst, big fruit, fresh hops, peachy, melon, orange, and, yes, mango, and more, a bountiful bouquet that keeps the nose happy and hoppy. Man, but I need a taste, though!
An explosion in the mouth, the hops are a bursting throughout, but so well buttressed by malt, that any bitterness is mellow and well smoothed out, after an initial bite, at least. Like chomping into a ripe tangerine, juice splashing on the corners of the mouth and dripping down the chin. Though hoppiness flows freely, and bitterness peeks through time and again, the mouthfeel is actually soft and luxuriant, body is medium, and the overall effect is a constant joyride for the palate. A lively and rewarding ale, and a real American classic, a jewel in the craft-brew crown. Count yourself lucky if you can grab these with ease.

Grapefruit juice is one of my favorite flavours - so too is grapefruit hopped beer. This one smells like a Florida fresh grove beside a stand of pine trees. The rich copper colour and slightly off white frothy head are beyond my expectations for an American Pale - beautiful. Grapefruit and hops engage in a fresh sweet and bitter  battle in your mouth - but only briefly as it is a very dry mouthfeel. Bitter puckering finish - very nice.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"

An immediate aroma of American hops wafts from my glass.  Notes of lychee, grapefruit & other citrus fruits are in the nose, it smells slightly sweet & nectar like, there is a hint of caramel malt here as well.  Ooh, quite bitter; this beer finishes with a drying intense bitterness.  Overall this beer is only slightly sweet, it has a light body & is focused entirely on the hop component.  The hops are over the top, but perhaps it is missing some hop flavor.  There is lots of bitterness, but it feels like it is missing some balancing hop nectar flavor.  Underlying the hop attack there seems to be some nuttiness, as well as some caramel notes.  This beer is all about the hop attack, not much malt here, so if you don't like hops stay away.  Luckily I do like hops so this beer is just fine.  Perhaps a bit too unbalanced for an everyday drinking beer, but every once in a while is nice.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Amazing malt flavor with layers of hops complexity.  This sixer was pure heaven.  I swear God himself made this batch.  I had to rerate because it was the best I have ever tasted.  If they could consistently provide this on my store shelves I might drink nothing else.  Note:  I bought every sixer at the store.

Clear, glowing reddish-amber with a light tan head that holds at a thick cap.  Wonderful aroma of pine resin and grapefruit soaked hops.  Very little malt discernable on the nosea touch of sweet caramel and bread.  The flavor is a lopsided balance skewed towards the hoppy side, with lots of spicy, complex hop flavor and sturdy bitterness.  Grapefruit, pine resin, the hops are almost sweet in character.  The only flaw in this brew is that the caramelly and bready malt backbone is a bit thin, and it shows in the body, which is on the lighter side of medium.  Ends with a firm bitterness, as well as a hint of alcoholic dryness.  More malt, and it would be Dreadnaught Jr.  Overall, an incredible brew and a constant in my beer fridge, despite its little flaw.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"

The difference between the two is substantial.  The New Ulm version looks good but is devoid of character and left me wondering why everyone had such a hard-on for this stuff.  The Munster version showed me why.  It's fantastic.  Hops and malt are extremely well balanced.  The hops show through with an expertise that stuns me.  Bright, complex and delicious.

4024,"2003-10-22",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2005 It pours a hazy amber body and despite being poured straight, it doesnt make such a big head. What is there is there to stay though and never leaves until the last sip. The smell is deep hops, fragrant and tea-like, especially citrus cascade, a great sniff for sure. Backing crystals are very expressive and procure lots of balancing sweetness. In mouth, you receive the same treatment, tasty malt balanced with loads of hops bring you to a piney bitter aftertaste, but not  before passing through a flower field where grapefruits fall from the sky. In my opinion, this would have won a lot from a thicker body, it was thin to medium and a little lacking to support such intensity (or I had too full-bodied beers recently). On the other hand, while it was one of the most tasty, it was also one of the most drinkable APAs Ive had. Thanks Egajdzis!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Aromas...where to start? Right off the bat, it is apparent this beer is full of fresh hops. Floral, piney, resinous smelling hops are very noticeable here gang. Slight dry biscuit aroma quickly fades. The hops are what makes this beer great, though. Sticky mouthfeel, slight coating of the old tongue. Finishes bitter & very hoppy.
A pretty good IPA, but not quite as good as their Dreadnaught.","","Cobra"

I was wondering what the difference between their IPA and the APA would be; they are somewhat different beers. This one seems to have a little more roasted flavor, and not as intensely hopped. It is not as sweet as Dreadnaught, and of course not as strong ABV. Perhaps also a little more drinkable (and less dangerous) in large quantities.

4024,"2003-08-01",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2006 2002 Bottle. Awesome murky reddish-orange color, with tons of frothy burnt white head.  Smells citrusy, and a touch of alcohol aroma arises, as well.
Begins very strong with lots of cascade hops. Full bouquet of hops continues through body and it finishes bitter.  Not too much detectable yeast, and while the body is clean and tastey, there didnt seem to be much distinguishing this from any other top tier APA until. . .!! It warmed up!!! This beers flavor and palate have just improved tenfold after warming, every sip I took had a wonderful flavor in the finish that lingered. I can best describe it as an alcohol/butterscotch malt flavor that has a bit of a slow burn to it. It really complemented the huge hoppy flavor and left me very happy with this beer and wanting to try more.  Previous score:  8/4/9/5/182006 bottle.  Still a very lovely fruity, hoppy, lush nose, with sweet malts backing it and not overdone in bitterness.  Toned down dreadnaught, I guess.  But the hard crystal malt behind it and filtered, washed out mouthfeel just dont cut it.  Plenty of average brewers are doing much better things in the mouthfeel category.  I suppose not the biggest of complaints, but bottle conditioning is bottle conditioning and this less-than-tight carbonation is lacking.  Hard crystal malts do not help either.  Score is for this bottle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4024,"2003-07-13",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2004 Draft, at the Brewery. Ah, the firstborn child of Nick & Co's ""Not Normal"" brewing philosophy. It's almost damning with faint praise not to call it an IPA (in which case, it'd rate second to 3F's own Dreadnaught. At our homebrew club meeting at the brewery, it felt as though we were swimming on the US's entire hop production for the year. Tangy citrus hop flavor will give you a buzz long before the alcohol can work its magic. An inspiration to every amateur or pro brewer to ""go BIG, or go home!""
Bottled: Not surprising that the bottled version is a little tamer than we had fresh at the brewery, even if I did get the bottles straight from the brewery.

Unfortunately, I cannot so bend my will to the King.  I may revel in the bountiful odor which eminates from him, and I may admire the attractive head sitting on its body, but I will not proffer obedience and infatuation which extends to every flavor I can lick from him.  The King is, afterall, no greater--morally speaking, anyway--than his peers.  He carries some respect for his glowing appearance, and earns plaudits for reaching my nose with an attractive floral bouquet, but for flavor I give only what is due, and what is due is the same respect that every hopping, bitter citizen of the pale ale world gets.

When I'm in the mood for a bounce in the step and a jump in my mood, I'll gladly take my hops Three Floyds style.
Updated 9/23/03: like the Scottish Ale, my original tasting of this Pale was of the contract-brewed version.  The Munster-bottled Alpha King is very piney, with a caramel/dark amber color and a thin tan head.  Flavor?  Pine, pine, pine.  Nice malt balance too.  And, did I mention, pine?

Perfect carbonation, almost creamy on the palate with tiny bubbles just a swirl away from a fresh head.  A late, but short lived finish with a light aftertaste.  Good hops balance, not overwhelming, but clear and intentional.  Light malt flavor balanced out the hops and some of the citrus.  The flavor definitely improved as it lost the chill from the fridge.

Very crisp with hops and strong citrus flavors (grapefruit is right).  Goes down with a little spice in the crisp finish.  Very solid beer.  Very drinkable and very enjoyable.

It has to be to serve as a carrier for all those hops! Very crisp up front, yet some subtle hop components underneath. Pretty grapefruity. Almost orange color, off white lingering head.

The flavor isn't as hoppy as an IPA, there seems to be this ongoing battle in the flavor between hops and a strong, citrus taste.  There is also a subtle malt presence in it, but not quite enough for my taste.  It lacks some body, but it is a decent drink.

Just recently I have come across hand-pulled A.K.'s and love it equally. I'd love to watch a group of British Cask drinkers get their hands on this, it would turn them inside out. Massive flavor.

I find that the flavor profile seems to work in reverse--there is a lot of citric hop bitterness in the front, followed by a pleasing, rich maltiness (still with plenty of citrus, but other fruit as well) which draws up in a final citric dryness.

The initial taste surprisingly seemed a bit bland and almost watery, if only for a fraction of a second before you are bombarded with citric hops.

The appearance isnt too much. Color of one of the lighter shades of leather with an off-white head that was neither large nor long lasting. Nose is malty with hops that are dominated by the Christmas tree-like over the citrus but both are present. Flavor is surprisingly thick malt for a pale beer with a nice balance with the hops.

4024,"2002-08-17",4.4,"This is about the best APA I have had. It might even edge out GL Burning River. Pretty copper color with a thick beige head and nice lacing. Strong hops and ginger aroma. The flavor was excellent as well. Citrus, ginger, brown sugar and hops were all dancing around in there. Hops did not diminish at all throughout the glass. This is a crisp, good tasting beer that will set the standard for APAs for me for the forseeable future.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

Great citrus-hop flavor, very crisp.  Still a good balance and the toasty, malty side of the beer comes out stroger when its not as cold.  Recommended for fans of beer with high hops content.  Im quite proud that something of such high quality comes from my home state of Indiana.  Three cheers for Three Floyds!","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","FastEddie"

4024,"2002-06-06",2.3,"On tap.  Wonderful grapefruit aroma which hinted at the hops to come.  Color was a medium burnt amber.  Taste leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion.  There was a huge malty sweetness to start, with a little tartness, then it finished with a huge hoppy presence.  My taste buds could just not take it.  It seemed as if the ingredients were acting against one another instead of in harmony.  I couldnt finish this one.","New York, USA","Steak"

4024,"2002-05-29",3.8,"Alpha King was orangish-copper in color with a nice sized, pillowy, white head.   The nose was super hoppy, with definate floral notes.    The aroma suffered from a subdued but noticeable mustiness.   Hops dominated the flavor profile making me question why this high-alpha ale isnt considered an IPA.

Light-medium amber color, very faintly hazy, with a fine, creamy head.  Begins with a brief glimpse of toasty malt sweetness, before turning substantially hoppy and fruity.  Hops dominate deep into the finish, but a modicum of malty sweetness resurfaces late.  One of the more hoppy Pale Ales one is likely to encounter and luckily the blend is chosen very well.  Instantly appealing.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

cereal and caramel combined with heavy flowery tones of grass, resin, and soapy
grapefruit.  The flavor is outstandingly balanced with something for everyone here.  You
like malt?  Its in there...How about hops?  Ditto... How about a little citrus to suck on...
you get the picture.  The long finish is also a plus.  This brew has a medium body with a
