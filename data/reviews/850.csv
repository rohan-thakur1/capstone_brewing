850,"2015-05-26",3.3,"This is an odd duck for me. Pours very slightly murky limited head and just some spots of lacing. Nose is peach and syrup. Flavours are syrup, some apple and peach, and some grassy bitterness. Tastes are light/medium sweet, light bitter. Body is much thicker than I was expecting, with a sticky sweet finish that lingers.","Ontario, CANADA","rejtable"
850,"2015-03-11",2.9,"June 26, 2013 - on draught at WVRST. Amber pour average off-white head. Grainy and grassy aroma, definitely a bit boozy - taste follows, plenty of grain and alcohol - how is this not a malt liquor? - a little OTT. Thin body, astrinent and hot, average carbonation, a little sweet and grassy in the boozy finish. Did I mention this is boozy? Roadhouse!!!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
850,"2014-12-06",3.6,"Bottle given to me by my brother. Pours an orange copper, big fluffy white head. Nose is sweet caramel malt. Tastes sweet , bitter, topical hops. Good balance.","Dundas, Ontario, CANADA","Hammy78"

850,"2014-08-26",3.9,"Au nez on sent l'alcool, le grain torréfié et un soupçon de fumée caramélisé. Ça me rappelle la 90minutes de Dogfish. On goûte des allures de pommes confites. La finale enveloppe la bouche pour des heures! Délicieuse biere

850,"2014-08-03",3.7,"limited release from this Barrie Ont. Craft Brewer. This, at first blush, appears to be an amped up imperialized version of a marzen amber lager. A closer inspection reveals that this is another of Peter Chodos concept beers utilizing an esoteric hop variety against a supporting blend of specialty malts in a common style, yielding uncommon results. In Green Man we see the use of some unique New Zealand hop varieties normally used in ales to spice up this big malty lager  and these abstract elements just connect well in this beer. Big, malty, hoppy, modest complexity with subtle unexpected tastes for a lager - like vanilla, caramel, nuts, lemon grass. Medium bodied and satisfying, this is a big lager with all sorts of pleasant unconventional surprises.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
850,"2014-07-04",3.5,"Bottle from the brewery. Pours a hazy deep amber with a small off white head that leaves nice lace. Nose is bread and toffee with grain and some grass. Quite sweet caramel and honey start with a a modest hoppy resinous bitterness following. Full creamy mouth with average carbonation and a boozy finish.","Newmarket, Ontario, CANADA","jksipa"

850,"2014-01-24",3.1,"On tap at the Only Cafe during the FM tap take over. Pale copper with white creamy head. Grainy, sweet, malt, moderate body and carbonation, some sugary sweetness then goes back to dry and hoppy on the finish - sorta all over the place.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
850,"2013-12-21",3.6,"Bottle - 750ml. Amber body with a thin white foamy head. Fresh hoppy aroma with malty and grapefruit hints. Alcohol is well hidden. Its sharp hoppy taste carries woody and citrusy notes. Ends with a long, strong bitter finish. Well done.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
850,"2013-12-18",3.3,"750 mL bottle at the brewery for Mooses birthday, served in a tasting glass. Pours clear caramel with small ring if white foam. The nose has big malty notes with caramel and honey with a touch of herbal hops. The flavour is moderately sweet up front but it quickly becomes bitter with resinous hoppy notes. It closes out with a moderate bitter finish. On the palate it is medium in body with a syrupy texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a fairly simple imperial lager with a prominent bittering hop bill. 2013-11-23","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"
850,"2013-11-12",3.5,"Bottle - Amber malt sweetness with a bit of hops and booze. Clear copper with a thin white head. Orange, candy malts and booze. The burn is a bit much, but not bad.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
850,"2013-10-19",3.1,"750 ml bottle from the Flying Monkeys store, in Barrie. Pours a dark amber colour with medium off-white head. Aroma is sweet malts, hops, some caramel. Taste is grassy hops, sweet malts, earth. Decent beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","MarkoR"
850,"2013-08-08",3.1,"On tap. Clear brew with a amber or light copper colour. fairly muted aroma, grains, citrus hops and some sweet notes. I also get a real soapy aroma. On the palate it is fairly sweet, malted with a leafy or hoppy bitterness that has a slight ashtray bite that I dont enjoy. Un-balanced, hot and not that interesting.","Canadiana, Ontario, CANADA","Bendrixian"
850,"2013-08-04",3.4,"Sampled at Toronto Festival of Beer. Good, strong, crisp. Grassy and citrus-hopped flavour.","","LarryBeast"
850,"2013-07-23",3.0,"Sweet caramel on the nose. Boozy and lightly hoppy. Mostly just sweet and boozy.","Greenbelt, Maryland, USA","ApisAles"
850,"2013-07-23",3.2,"Pale golden pour. The nose is softly floral with a lot of sweet sticky malt. Moderate honeyish malt sweetness and a bit of heat as well. Hoppy - but not hoppy enough on the aroma. Malts are clean but its still a bit of a miss for me.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
850,"2013-07-22",3.5,"On tap at the Only Cafe. Pours a clear orange/amber with modest-sized white head. Aroma is green, grassy hops and chewy bread with some alcoholic edges. Flavour likewise with a bit of alcoholic bite. Decent bitterness in finish. Nice.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Spab"
850,"2013-07-19",3.5,"A golden amber lager with a thin off white head. In aroma, light caramel malt with vinous notes, smooth. In mouth, sweet vinous treacle malt with grassy floral hops, grapefruit, nutty notes, well made.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
850,"2013-07-11",3.5,"Pours a clear dark amber with thin head. Aromas of citrus hops and cut grass. Tastes about the same with some earthy, pine notes. High carbonation but its suited for the style.","Ontario, CANADA","TylerJonScott"
850,"2013-07-10",3.3,"Draught at Sauce on the Danforth, June 29. Pours a deep copper-gold with an average size long-lasting frothy off-white head. Aroma is sweet and hoppy with caramel malt, lots of grassy hops and some alcohol. Flavour is really bitter and alcoholic, lots of grassy hops but the finish is astringent and harsh. Medium bodied. Too boozy and harsh, tone that down and it would be better, as it is, just good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
850,"2013-07-04",3.5,"Crazy pour at Sauce on Danforth is auburn with a thin cap that sprouts serious lacing. Nose takes me back to dark rum in st Lucia. The rum carries through on the sipping with hints of vanilla & malt. Almost cocktail like in its balance. The booze in this one is hard boiled. One too many & you will be dancing on the floor like youve got ice skates on. If you like it weird & adventurous than this one is for you.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
850,"2013-06-28",3.5,"2013-06-22. Crisp orange amber body small white head. 3+ Aroma is moderate. Very light grassy citrusy hops. Flavour is pleasant, moderate bitterness up front, sweet caramel kissed pale malt, dry alcohol in the finish adds a light astringency to it. Pleasant but the alcohol detracts slightly from the rest. Average plus bodied palate, soft carbonation suits it. Session Festival 2013","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
850,"2013-06-23",3.5,"Strange beast but a good one. Pours clear amber with decent head and lacing. Carbonation is pretty high but its a lager. Aroma of malt, some booze and lots of piney hops. Definitely good for category, and even holds up well next to most pale ales. Tap at Session.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
