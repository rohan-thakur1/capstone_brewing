777,"2009-08-20",2.4,"As with the altbier, this one had some diacetyl in it as well.  Not nearly as overpowering as the alt, but it still detracted from the overall experience.  Some fruitiness noticed with typical hefe qualities.  However, based on the diacetyl, this was much less drinkable than the regular hefeweizen, which was pretty good and much better by comparison.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
777,"2009-08-03",3.6,"On draught at the brewpub in Menomonie: Poured a clear brownish colour with a two finger sized off white head. Firm and malty with brown sugar, cinnamon and something that finishes tart. Cranberry and sour cherry for sure. Aroma is really nice, semi sweet with some toast on the nose. It was easier to distinguish different tastes with these beers being served slightly warmer then normal.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
777,"2008-07-03",4.2,"July 2nd, 2008 Sample platter.  Moderate cookie, and molasses smell with a very light flower aroma.  Frothy head atop a almost clear brown brew.  Sweet creamy taste with a slight hop aftertaste.  My favorite brew on the sample platter.","Eau Claire, Wisconsin, USA","Baumgartner"

Draught at the brewpub. The beer was murky brown with a moderate amount of foam. In the aroma I got caramel malt, banana, wheat, and yeast, and alcohol. All those things were present in the flavor as well along with a very mild smokiness.","Valhalla, Minnesota, USA","akevitt"
777,"2007-11-18",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub on 6/22/07: Transparent dark copper appearance with a frothy, clingy-lacing white head.  Aroma of lightly sweet caramel malt with a touch of banana and lemon citrus.  Starts fairly full and dark caramely sweet with nice bready German yeasty balance.  A nice dunkelweizen.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

777,"2007-08-08",4.0,"Thanks to Skyview for sharing.  Pours a nice murky dark brown with a small tan head.  Nice banana, clove, toffee, and yeasty spiciness.  A little bit of a butterscotch like sweetness preceeds, very nice sweet banana, ripe dark fruits, toffee, and a hint of roasted nuts.","Farewell Minny; Hello Puyallup, Washington, USA","joebrew"
777,"2007-07-17",4.2,"Another from Skyview.  This is an outstanding dunkelweizen, just what the style should be.  The aroma has considerable wheat and banana, as well as light citrus.  Flavor is really good.  Very light roasted grain, and abundant wheat, citrus, and banana here as well.  Thick and grainy texture, it reminded me of New Glarus Black Wheat.  Sweet, but not with a sugary flavor.  Thick and full mouthfeel.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
777,"2007-07-09",3.6,"Thanks to skyview for sharing.  Bannan nose with cloves and wheat of course.  Dark brown color with minimal head.  Body similar to the aroma in flavor.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
777,"2007-07-09",4.3,"Another growler thanks to Skyview.  Brown color with a medium head.  Big aroma of wheat, banana and cloves.  Sweet, caramelly flavor.  The expected banana and wheat are there with a little bit of roasted malt.  Excellent brew and great for the style.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
777,"2007-07-07",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2009 Original rating, 7-7-07: After seeing Skyviews raves, I decided to head down to Menomonie and check out Das Bierhaus for myself. I ordered the sampler, in which I got about 4 oz. each of all five of Das Bierhaus beers for the very reasonable price of $5. Classic dunkelweizen aroma features bubblegum and milk chocolate scents. Pours a slightly hazy but mostly clear amber / light brown with a gold hue and a cream-colored head. Sweet, fruity, sugary, chocolatey taste. Pear and pitted fruit flavors (cherry, plum). Lemony finish. Light body. Smooth in the palate. 7/4/7/3/14::>3.5

<P>Re-rate, 8-7-09: Small pour (approx. 3 or 4 ounces), on tap at the brewpub. Aroma of heavy bubblegum, watermelon, and carob. Pours a clear brown with near-white head. Sweet flavor that reminds me of M&Ms. Palate: Light body, soft, well carbonated, very drinkale, a little oily, smooth. 7/3/7/4/14::>3/5. Used re-rate score for official score.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
777,"2007-07-01",4.2,"Visited Das Bierhaus for their official Grand Opening on June 30. This Hefeweizen Dunkel was an excellent experience. Pours a hazy dark caramel brew with a thick and creamy off-white head. Lacing is sticky on the side of beer glass. Aroma of banana nectar, vanilla cream, caramel, and some sour dough bread. Taste is smooth and creamy, little citrus sweetness, cloves and white pepper. Finish has an excellent balance of hops and fruity esters. After finish, this Hefeweizen Dunkel even has a creamy caramel aftertaste. One of the best Hefeweizen Dunkels to date.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
