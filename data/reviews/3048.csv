3048,"2010-03-15",3.8,"A: This is not a particularly attractive beer with a hazy mahogany color with very light carbonation and a small tan head.

S: The nose offers plenty of nice sweet caramel with the oak and bourbon providing a nice vanilla aroma. There are some nondescript dark fruits as well.

T: Like the aromas, this one is full of caramel and vanilla deliciousness. Theres a nice toffee and molasses flavor as well, along with the nice bourbon and oak and raisins.

M: The beer is a bit warm, but the low carbonation and fairly full body provide for a pleasant experience.

D: I wasnt the hugest fan of the regular Dipsea, but I found that the barrel aging added quite a bit to it. Im glad Ive been able to try this one a couple times now.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3048,"2009-12-30",3.8,"Bomber, Heaven Hill version bottle #

Pours a deep mahogany that shows brighter amber when held up to light and a small bubbly off-white head that recedes quickly to a small collar.

The aroma is sweet with caramel malts and vanilla and the dryness from the barrels coming through as well.  There is a watery bourbon aroma that leaves a slight burn in the nostrils with each whiff.  Underwhelming aroma to be honest.

The taste steps it up a bit.  There is the caramel malt backbone but there are some dark fruits that compliment the bourbon better than the more watered down aromas Im getting.  Its like rum-soaked raisins.  The finish is sweet with brown sugar, vanilla and bourbon.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very slick - bordering on watery, even for a bourbon-barrel beer.

This is a very good barleywine, with the taste really standing out to me.  The body is a little light for me and keeps it from being a world-class beer.  Its extremely drinkable and one of the easiest-drinking BBBWs Ive had.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
3048,"2009-12-24",3.6,"Aroma is sweet bourbon, vanilla, dull hops, and caramel.

Taste is bourbon, vanilla, a slight sourness, peat.  
Finish is a bit sour and watery.  Oak is present, but not overwhelming- in no way aggressive.  Bourbon is also well done, but I feel like the overall beer is a bit thin and uninteresting.  The bourbon and oak impart the complexity to this beer.  
Otherwise, this is a bit underwhelming.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

Thanks to Mike I think for cracking this open though it could have been someone else.  This is my first experience with Marin and hopefully not my last.  While bourbon barrel aging big beers is not novel when done right the results are fantastic.  This is no exception though I might place it just short of world class.

Aroma / Appearance - Ruby red with little carbonation the body is a rich blend of bourbon, vanilla, and oak.  I picked up a bit of something a bit off that came through despite the heat of the alcohol and barrel.

Flavor / Palate - Tasting like warm caramel icing followed by a rinse of bourbon this is big and complex.  The hops have taken a back seat to other aspects including in the warm but smooth finish.  A decent example of how to properly age a barleywine I think this one has potential to make a name for itself.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Looks like Im the first rating for this (hopefully not the last, since there are only 180 bottles).  They need to brew a ton more of this.  A rival to Angels Share.  Bottle #72/180.  Bottled in 3/2/2007, tasted 4/29/08, so there a nice amount of bottle aging as well.  Tasted side-by-side against the un barrel aged.  Clearly this is much better.  The un-barrel aged I give the same rating of 3.9, that I rated when I tried it early.  The barrel aged beast I give a 4.9.  It is wonderful what a little barrel and bottle aging will do to a barleywine.  Pours a thick dark amber color with more head than the un barrel aged.  Why is that?  Lots of buttery caramelized oak aromas.  Sweet, soft, mellow texture.  Bourbon barrel aged, but NO over the top bourbon burn, thank you, which reduces drinkability.  The perfect aroma gets even better as the beer warms up.  Very easy to drink, as I sample, and sample, and sample again.  Yum.  Would love to do a side-by-side with the Angels Shares and BA Old Numbskull.  I think this would win in a blind test, even though it might score the same as Angels Share.
