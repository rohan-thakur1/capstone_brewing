4501,"2016-10-29",4.5,"Its impossible to rate this crazy invention. I opened this bottle 2 years(!) ago, and I havent been able to write a reasonable rating before now. Should the Penguin be compared to an imperial stout? Should it be rated as a whisky? Should it be given extra points for being an absurd creation? Well, this is probably one of the most amazing liquids that has ever entered by mouth, so lets rate it as such. It is an extremely intense beer concentrate, with every element you find in a perfect barrel aged imperial stout turned up to 11. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, dark dried fruits, dark berries, oak, whisky, vanilla, alcohol... you just pick every random word that pops into your head when you think about ""barrel aged imperial stout"" and youll find it in this remarkable syrup. Its heavy sweet and heavy bitter, and the finish is everlasting. The pitch black body is not carbonated, but that doesnt bother me. Its a beer that can be stored for months after opening without degrading. I do not recommend keeping it for two years, though, some notes of wet paper and cardboard has started to become a bit too obvious. The first half year after opening, this is close to perfection. Wow.

Cork smells exactly like Abstrakt. Umami. Strong hints of Tamari.

Strong herbal notes with licorice lingering. No carbonation. Port like appearance.

Syrupy mouthfeel. Activates salty and savory taste receptors. Sweet on the front of the tongue. Has raspberries, prunes and dates on the sides of the tongue. Distracting alcoholic fumigation at this phase of tasting.

The palate has hints of well-worn cured leather.

Although no obvious carbonation, there is a pleasant carbonic tingle when sipped. This is an obscure homage to its beery origins.

When forced through and past the palate and up the nose and aerated this way, has earthy hints of freshly harvested shiitake.

The tail end of the 2nd glass releases some nice sour plum goodness. Surprising. It keeps unfolding...

When shooting, has nice caramel flavors, redolent with the richness of flan with caramel sauce, milky and creamy.

No point attempting to appreciate any change in the nose after the first go around, does not change and has the same musky, savory nose which does not mellow with oxygenation or breathing.

Overall, a very satisfying beer experience somewhat marred by the need for novelty, chiefly the outrageous alcohol content which made a quite remarkable imperial stout more difficult to enjoy than it shouldve been.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

4501,"2014-09-06",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2015 Oak aged imperial stout pumped to an ultra strong kind of stout liquor by means of the Eisbock method, like nearly all those super strong, liquor-like beers (if you can still call them that). No head due to the extreme alcohol strength, colour totally black. Exceedingly dense and powerful, if not overpowering, uncompromizing aroma of liquorice, peat, ashes, coffee liqueur, sherry, smoky single malt, bitter chocolate; candied fruits mark the onset, no carbonation, extremely dense and concentrated, very viscous and oily, very profoundly malty, woody, smoky, strong roasted bitterness like the strongest black coffee, all drenched in an explicit but elegant alcohol burn not unlike whisky or gin, very warming in the throat and very long. This thing will stick with you forever. Imperial stouts, because of their heavily concentrated character, lend themselves perfectly for this treatment - I liked this a lot more than their (even stronger) Sink the Bismarck, where the icing procedure was applied to IPA.

Lots of alcohol on the aroma, the first that hits the nose. Behind it aromas of vanilla, roasted malts, whiskey.
Intense alcohol burn that even made me cough a bit. Very sweet. Vanilla again, wood, whiskey, chocolate.
Full thick body, nice soft carbonation. Sticky on the palate.
Really great beer, fantastic sipper. If it wasnt that boozy it would be even better but hey, its 32% alc, Im not asking for miracles here.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"

The aroma is a potent blend of Vegemite, soy sauce and hot alcohol, with fortified wine and smoky Scotch notes coming through. A faint muscat flavour up front is overcome by herbal hops and peaty Scotch whisky. Bittersweet dark chocolate and savoury soy sauce come in at the mid-palate, with luscious sweet muscat at the finish. There is warming alcohol aftertaste, mixed with herbal hops. This is a very interesting one. I have always liked the bombastic lunacy of BrewDog, and this is a prime example. It feels more like a fine whisky or fortified wine than a beer as such. It presents a curious blend of sweet, savoury and boozy, that overall works very well. Nice stuff.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

My first sip brings no relief from the torturous aroma. Its a mouthful of ashtrays alongside relentless, burning alcohol.

Like I said above, I was not quite ready.  The burn on this one is huge and it got stuck in my throat.  I almost lost my first full sip on the floor but luckily as Mom always told me Dont chew with your mouth open I just couldnt believe the hotness on this one.   It was like sucking down moonshine.  But the next few sips were just fine as I ready for the barrage of hotness.

Theres a certain sweetness to the beer but its overshadowed by the alcohol and the smokey and sometimes charred wood effect.

Toffee plays about.... mid palate brings out some honeyed fruits and then whisky arrives late and is wrapped in a solid bitterness. I was pleasently surprised by this stuff and the 2 ounces I did drink was enough to give it a fair judgement. Well done BrewDog.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","Powertrip"

The appearance is a brown/red color that leaves huge alcohol legs on the glass. Taste is very interesting. I was actually surprised that there is some carbonation in this beer. The taste is full of roasted malt notes with some nice raisin flavors coming through. Has a very Sherry like mouthfeel.

This pours a thick black with the viscosity of motor oil only darker. A vigorous pour produced hints of a head that disappeared almost instantly. Smells of roast and chocolate a little bit, but really this is an overwhelming scotch and peat bomb. Lots of higher alcohol and that smoky peaty aroma that you get from a scotch is amplified from the freezing process. The taste does have some stout attributes, roast, caramel and fruit, but those are buried deep beneath the onslaught of smoked peat moss.

Some syrupy sweetness, dark fruit, sherry and a touch of burnt rubber to start with, before folding into more defined fruity spiciness, and then a smokey finish. Nice liqueur mouthfeel too. If I may be permitted a bad metaphor, with the smoke and burnt rubber notes, with the oily appearance and mouthfeel, this beer is essentially Jim Clarks 1967 Lotus in a drink.

Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black, and what little head it had fizzled away pretty quickly.  No lacing at all, but there are ""legs"" that I can see when I swirl the beer around the glass.  I dont think Ive noticed that in a beer before, I only usually see that when Im drinking liquor.  Aroma is very boozy.  Along with the booze, I can also smell dark fruit, smoke/peat, chocolate, and some molasses.  The brew tastes like booze (sherry), smoke/peat, dark fruit (raisins, cherries, figs) and molasses.  Its still hot, but the other flavors arent overpowered by the hotness.  Theres also a boozy smoky/sweet finish that lingers around for a long time.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a syrupy and very, very slick and coating with low carbonation.  As Ive noticed with other BrewDog stouts Ive tried in the past, this is a thinner stout than Im used to but since I liked the syrupy slickness Im not going to knock down the score too much.  I think this is a solid beer, itll be interesting to see how this one ages.  Definitely worth a try, its surprisingly drinkable for a 32% ABV brew even though it took me about an hour to finish the bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

No foam, just a dark ruby beer that bounces off a lot of room lights. Smell now has notes of Baileys Irish Cream. First tiny sip is a bottomless pit of brown malt. Full of alcohol fumes, but somehow not hot. Just the first two sips have left the inside of my mouth with a coating of malt and resin. Heck, its varnish and a clear coat on top, too. Even less than an ounce worth is quite intoxicating. No one who doesnt know the story of this drink would think its a beer.

As it develops, the smoke dwindles and gives more room to the dark fruits and, to a lesser extent, the liquorice, as well as peat (guess thats where the smoke went). Finish is more sweet liquorice and dark fruits, with smoked notes resembling whisky (more peat, I guess), lingering. Also a lingering sweet alcoholic note, reminding me of first of Cinzano Rosso, and later of cognac. Overall interesting and actually rather good; good aroma and flavour and the alcohol is well-balanced and doesnt nearly resemble the high %.

The aroma consists of peat, smoked meat, chocolate, figs, and of course, alcohol. Strong alcoholic whiskey and smoke flavor with undercurrents of cocoa, spice and fruit. The flavor seemed to be quite complex, but was a bit overpowered by the alcohol. Not sure Id label this one as an imperial stout. Its quite thin; more the consistency of whiskey than beer. Definitely intense, its not something Id probably spend the money on again, but i had to be tried.","Richmond, Texas, USA","rougeau13"

The taste is syrupy-malty at first but quickly becomes liquor-like; its smokey (not quite burnt), with a smoothenes (like a tequilla shot) and a strong warming sensation that coats the mouth and throat.  Best way to describe it is like malty liquor...feels like alcohol fumes in your mouth, but it is much more drinkable (and sip-able) than a typical liquor.

Aroma of tobacco, smoked and roasted malts, charred wood, and a whole lot of alcohol. In fact, keeping this up to your nose for more than a few seconds is like taking a big whiff of mineral spirits in terms of the heat you feel. But despite the smoke and heat, I liked the smell. Flavor of alcohol throughout, along with cigar tobacco, roasted malts, charred wood, and some malty, sugary sweetness. Medium-full bodied, with mild carbonation and a very boozy, very ashy mouthfeel.

I usually wouldnt rate such a small sample but at 32% and about $100 Im gonna call it good enough since I feel I got a failry good evaluation of the brew. The appearance is a carmel/chocolate flowing brown color. Almost a tawny hue I guess. The aromas are mostly alcohol with a lot of whiskey profile. The entry is heavy roasted malts and whiskey a very nice start. The middle quickly turns into a soy sauce which slowly leads to a solid dark fruit prune juice notes. The finish starts smoky but it mellows into a whiskey barrel graininess that just keeps going. Like liking the inside of a spent barrel. The mouth is very full bodied hot but not as much as I expected (at least with the small sample). Overall better then I was expecting. I could see this potentially aging into something pretty nice.

I asked for a bottle and they said, um well we serve it in these 10cl glasses here. I said oh ok, 4 euro for 10cl, what a bargain, and they reminded me it was 32% and I said ok start off small. So, they pored it, it was a dark, rick mahogany brown color. Syrupy, dark, caramely, barley wine looking guy. I smelled it, it instantly hit my nose as alcohol, fresh bread, cereal, smoke and tobacco.  The taste was of beer first, with a brandy/congac taste immediatley after, with hints of smoke/oak/roasted malt/honey/dark beer and leather. It was complex but again I had 2 sips. It lingered on the palate for a minute and subdued, but you got the vanilla, oak, smokes brew sensation and almost wine and brandy leftover. a hell of a beer. It was strong but not unpleasant. Its not a simple mystery to its ingredients because all of us agreed on a few items then we just lost our focus and kept drinking more.

4501,"2010-07-05",4.0,"Finally managed to get my hands on one of these, and last night me and a friend shared a bottle - a straight necessity not only due to the high ABV, but also due to the crazy price of this thing - 655 NOK (about 105 USD, current rates). I suspect Vinmonopolet have a strong saying in this, as BrewDog sells them off their website for 57 USD... :-(  Anyway, at such a price we made sure the event was enjoyable, unwrapping the penguin-decorated brown paper bag and having a laugh at the usual sharp BrewDog wit on the label. Tactical Nuclear Penguin poured out like some dark scotch; no head, deep coppery red-amber body - surprisingly transparent and liquor-like. We took quite some time with our noses down our snifters; the smell is intense and pleasant: booze (but not overpowering), wood, caramel and hints of peat and smoke. Very smooth aromatic profile. Then, it was time to raise our glasses and give the antarctic bird its proper salute. First sip hits me like a brandy or whiskey; lots of warming alcohol spreading out in a fan of flavor: whiskey, oak, smoke, tar, leather, licorice. Layer after layer. Cough syrup, caramel, chocolate, coffee. Hints of cherry somewhere in there? To uncover all the nuances took me almost as long as the drink itself, and I kept backtracking my taste buds to give room for new interpretations along the way. This is good stuff, very complex and enticing. I found myself reaching for my glass way more frequent than initially expected. Although this is a beer in a different league, it still retained a distinct imp stout profile. Splendid stuff, although I dont feel a pressing urge to drink it again any time soon; the price is discouraging and the intensity of the brew something I can only deal with so often. Cudos to BrewDog for their experiment, I really enjoyed Tactical Nuclear Penguin.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

4501,"2010-06-20",2.7,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2010 City Beer Store, BrewDog night.  How exactly do you rate these super high alcohol beers?  I didnt enjoy it and wouldnt ever pay their asking price, but I also dont want to pan it as its an interesting exercise in brewing.  In terms of appearance, its dark brown with lighter highlights and no head.  Pretty good legs, I guess.  The smell is sorta acrid.  Bitter walnut shells and booze dominate the aroma.  Theres some big smoke and, maybe, caramel, but its all just kinda odd.  I was expecting it to taste more like whiskey, but its much too dirty and rough - makes me appreciate proper distillation.  Anyway, the flavor is even boozier and lacks the smoothness that I think necessary for this much alcohol.

Wow what an experience! This is an exceptional beer. It is very alcoholic and has lots of booze in both the smell and flavour. It tastes almost like a whisky but in a beer form.

Its definitely a beer to lean back and sip at. But is it good? Hard to say, I have mixed feelings about the beer. I wouldnt order it again as it is way to strong for my taste. I would prefer it with allot of flavour but with less alcohol. But yet again the main purpose of the beer is for it to be strong. Considering it as an extremely strong beer I actually like it, not a new favourite but good. Lots of flavour, lack of balance but still nice.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

Dark brown, nowhere near black. Disparate bubbles quickly fades away. No lacings. If it wasnt for the nice legs, this would look highly unimpressive. 

The nose is intensely boozy with powerful fusel alcohol fumes. Deeper breaths will burn a hole in your nasal septum. Decent aromas underneath the alcohol though. Caramel, roasted malts, smoky whisky and peat. Hints of ham and licorice.  

The taste is like getting slapped in the face by Satan. Lots of sweetness, mostly derived from the alcohol. Roasted malts, peat, caramel and charred wood make a quick appearance before the alcohol takes over, leading to a hot finish with powerful notes of salty licorice, sweet whisky, oak and peat. 

Full-bodied, basically no carbonation, sticky texture.

The nose is huge, with deep fruits, chocolate, smoke and a roast character, along with the expected alcohol. In the mouth, dark chocolate, deep fruits, some expended coffee grounds, roast malt with plenty of alcohol burn all the way through and lingering bitter chocolate and roast meat.

4501,"2010-04-13",3.5,"Pours rusty/brown with some amount of clarity, looks like a rum or liqueur in the glass. Very oily and leaves legs on the side of the glass. Aroma is pretty much all about Islay whisky characteristics. Salty, medicinal, smoky, iodine and of course boozy. Flavour is dominated by yet more Islay flavours, more iodine and peat/smoke, then into more chocolately territory, roasted-ish notes, raisins and dried fruits, itys quite hot and certainly warming on the throat and belly. Finish is spirit/liqueur-like with smoke still blowing about and residual sweetness. Its very hard to rate this beer with the Rate Beer point system, as palate rating and appearance are hard to pin down as both are not at all beer like and much more akin to a spirit. Im sure the, ""Is it a beer or a liqueur?"" debate will rage on for some time to come. AT the end of the day I respect the beer for its experimental nature and the fact that it has started some interesting debates around my part of the world. Is it over priced? Yes. Is it novelty? I think ot a degree. Is it clever marketing? Once again to a degree. Im glad Ive tried it, and most people should give it a go even if its split 6 ways as it still  marks a point in Beers evolution and its always best to see for yourself if something is marked ""controversial.""","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

Peat, salty licorice, heavily burnt malts, charred wood, vanilla and dark dried fruits too. It hits the mouth with a burning sensation, soon distributing heavily roasted malts and peat, and some dried fruits and vanilla. Sea, licorice, dried fruits, peat and burnt malts in the end. In addition to alcohol off course. Its full-bodied, oily and very warming, as expected.

How: Bottle 22oz.  Post-EBF tasting session #2 with east-coast crew.  Bottle brought my MrX (his identity shall remain a secret)
The look: Clear dark amber body with almost no head
In long: Ok, how to go about rating a 32% beer?  First the thought of sharing a single 12oz bottle between many of us seemed kind of ridiculous.  But looking back at it I wish there could have been more of us.  So anyway, I get my 1.5oz sample and move aside with my notepad.  That thing costs a bundle so lets at least give it a fair review.  First, the nose is surprisingly light for such a monster brew.  Just some alcohol fumes and light malty notes.  Smells like a very cheap scotch.  So far it is boring.  I wish it could have been boring.  Boring is not so bad.  Boring is just boring.  What comes next is nothing but boring.  Unfortunately.  I needed something like 6 sips to go through my tiny 1.5oz sample.  Thats how bad this atrocity is.  And dont give me that crap about rating it as a liquor.  I can drink whisky straight from the bottle.  I used to drink fucking Jack Daniels straight from the bottle.  And I still could.  I just dont want to anymore.  But that thing no way.  Unpalatable.  With each tiny sip I felt like I puked in my mouth, I was making faces and cursing the extreme brewing movement.  Thats all I can say about the taste: puke and alcohol.  Thats it.  And to think that a friend of mine paid over $100 for this atrocity.  Lets just say that he wasnt too pleased with his investment.  Because of the shame I will keep his identity a secret.  Lets just call him MrX
Me: How much did you pay for that crap? 
MrX: Id rather not talk about it.  A lot.  Over $100.
Me: What the hell were you thinking about Ryan?
MrX: I dont know.  But as true as my userid is Rciesla, I will not spend crazy amount of money on a mega-boozy over-hyped beer again.  I feel like such a dumbass sucker, please dont tell anyone I did that

Tactical Nuclear Penguin; A beer that arrives in the glass with a very very dark brown body, and little or no head. 3+ It carries with it a powerfully alcoholic aroma of nuclear proportions, all but smothering light smokey, and rough peaty/iodine like whiskey characteristics. When ingested it camouflages the smokey whiskey character beneath an ever present blanket of alcohol. A moderate, still body.; A beer of acquired taste.

Truth be told, had I known what was in the bottle I might have been less eager to acquire one. An intriguing experiment, which packs a flavourful punch, but decidedly not to my own tastes. I got my butt kicked by a Penguin... Huh.

Might make an ok scotch, but definitely not my thing.

S: Obviously, theres a large alcohol component to this beer at 32% ABV. That said, theres more to it than just the heat. Theres a slight caramel sweetness, vanilla, and a definite smokiness, almost peaty.

T: The alcohol heat takes a moment to get over, but after that, there are some decent flavors in there. The smoke and peat are a bit more pronounced than in the nose. Theres some vanilla, brown sugar, and caramel in the middle with a bitterness to the finish.

M: The lack of carbonation and huge amount of sweetness and alcohol make this too hot and a touch syrupy for my tastes.

D: This is one that Im glad to say that I tried. I honestly couldnt drink more than an ounce or two at once, and I think that perhaps in a couple decades, this might change a bit and become more palatable.

Black and oily with no head but some carbonation. Complex but overwhelmingly sweet with prunes, wood, smoke and some salty tobacco. Interesting, but as I expected, a testament to trying to push  boundaries way too far in the interests of egotistical oneupmanship. This beer is a genetic freak and has now seved its purpous. I enjoyed triyng it but am glad that I didnt have to pay through the nose. The  term Tactical in its title now makes perfect sense when considering that this beer was really a smoke screen for Brewdogs masterstroke in waiting. The Germans responded with their own abomination to thwart the sacrificial penguin. However, right out of the blue, Brewdog have hit a real killer punch with the launch of their stupendous Sink the Bismarck. A freak by sheer strength only, this beer has all the hallmarks of a pure bred  super IPA.. The battle is truly won. The Germans may boast that they have more strength in reserve but they may think twice about releasing it if they have the sense to try STB  in advance. They could  well end up with egg on their faces, bearing in mind the limitations of  the Reinheitsgebot and their rather tame indigenous hops.

Huge, huge, huge nose here: lots of brown sugar, bacon, roasted and charred malts, and an intensely caramelized sugar character; hugely dense, to say nothing of the wood contribution: charred and toasty barrel character; again, loads of caramelized brown sugar, like brew kettle scrapings; certainly plenty of heat and warmth here, but its not fusels or anything poorly presented; loads of smoky, roasted meats. Full body: intensely oily and charred: smoke pipe, ash, burnt malts and intense warming presence here: lots of charred barrel and clear spirit notes, but never materializes into a complete fullness or roundness of flavor for me, it stays more to the perimeter of the mouth: the ashiness, the astringency, the alcohol and the charred notes; lots of heat, and I thought the aroma was far more clearly expressed; ashy, burnt, like scraping a reasonably tasty, burnt-out barrel. Im impressed by how this beer holds itself together, all told; I just cant imagine drinking a whole bottle of this by myself; certainly more of an insane ash cordial.

Pours very dark brown with a small tan head and great legs.  This is a thick one for sure.

Aroma is very hot and boozy, like a rough scotch.  Sweet caramel, roast, oak, and vanilla poke through the intense alcohol.

The most prominent flavor in this beer is BOOOOOOOOOOOZE!  I didnt add all those Os for the hell of it.  Youre going to taste every bit of that 32% ABV.  Bud Select 55 this is not.  Definitely too hot.  Someone else at the tasting commented that they should have eised and then -bal aged this, not the other way around.  I agree.  10 years or so of age might do this beer good.  Once you get past the booze though, its a nice beer.  Roasted malt and caramel malt, toffee, oak, and mild peat smoke.  Like a Scotch, this needs time to round out.  Poor execution there on BrewDogs part in my opinion.

4501,"2010-01-29",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2010 33cl bottle from the brewery. Batch 001. Best before 2019-11. It was with great anticipation I poured this beer from the bottle and into a Delirium Tremens glass. I thought the glass was appropriate as this beer is almost guaranteed to give you Delirium Tremens (the condition that is, not the beer). The colour is pitch black with no visible head. Suprisingly there was some carbonation in the beginning. Dont know why, but the texture seemed a bit thin. The aroma is, not suprisingly, massive and laden with alcohol. Some smoke, oak and roasted malts as well. The first impressions of the flavour is smooth and balanced, but it doesnt take very long for the flavour to go nuclear. Massive alcohol of course, but also liqorice, smoke, rye, roasted malts and tar. The flavour lingers in the mouth a long time. This beer has received a lot of attention and not without merit, although Id classify this more as a fun experiment than a very good beer, but the whisky-crowd would probably appreciate it more.

This is now whisky concentrate with some amazing dark maltiness. Stunning salt, seaweed, peat and Isla brilliance. Just a tiny sip is like holding a massive gob full of whisky in your mouth.

I shared this with two mates after a long tasting and a bottle of 1985 port. It was a good finish to the night. The more I drink this the more I enjoy it.","Kent, ENGLAND","markdredge"
4501,"2009-12-31",3.7,"Small beige head. Dark red body tinged with brown. Intense chocolate salt toffee and malts aroma with peaty whisky caramel notes. Dense syrupy mouthfeel with intense alcohol burn. Strong sugary alcoholic earthy chocolatey salt taste with peaty smoky treacle notes. Very full body. Bitter alcohol, smoke, and whisky aftertaste. ""Notes"" is kind of misleading for this beer, which doesnt deal in subtleties. Absolutely outrageously intense. Really more like a whisky. (Small taster at Brewdog tasting at Dr Jekylls.)","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"
4501,"2009-12-29",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2010 33 cL bottle, bursted within 3 hours upon its arrival at my home, funny break just beneath the neck of the bottle and once I had emptied the bottle I saw that the bottom had burst into pieces. I could rescue alot - but the table still looked like a mess. At first I though a fuse had blown - but as the intense dark malt, alcohol and tarish smoke notes started to fill the room I knew what had happened. Shit happens. Aroma is intense - my table still smells like the inside of a whiskey barrel :) No head on what I rescued - however the content inside the bottle showed a small head. Flavour is burningly intense. Much like a whiskey just thicker and more dark i flavour. Solid tarish and with an intense alcoholburn. Ever lasting smoked, tarish and intense roasted malt flavour. More whiskey than beer - but certainly a nice sipper.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"

4501,"2009-12-27",3.8,"Taste from a bottle from MagicDave, thanks Tom.  Black no head.  Harsh aroma of whisky ice cream.  Hot Worcestershire sauce aroma, even meaty.  Its like a spirit.  Not like a beer.  Aroma is wonderful.  Choc and caramel and some hot alcohol.  It takes over your whole body.  Way too hot.  Good but way too bizarre.  Coffe and malt loaf on aroma too.  Great aroma of lots of different aromas and flavours.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
4501,"2009-12-25",4.4,"RATING 2500! A couple of bottles shared with several other lucky folks courtesy of Vlado & Liliana from Roland + Russell, the importers of Brewdog for Canada - many thanks to them for this pre-Christmas treat! First, I must confess that this isnt actually the 2500th beer Ive had since starting on RateBeer - Ive currently got a backlog of several hundred ratings in notebooks, and have been entering ratings very haphazardly and out of order for the past year or so. But when I found out that I was going to have a chance to try this, I decided to use it for this big milestone anyway. So, as for the beer - it has a deep brown-black colour with ruby highlights and a very still body. Aroma is outstanding - smoky, peaty, salty, soy sauce, toffee, and some alcohol heat, but not nearly as much as expected. Mouthfeel is smooth and supple, very nice! Flavour is deep and complex with notes of peat, salt, vanilla, licorice, burnt wood, whisky, smoke... and yes, of course, some boozy heat, but as with the aroma, not nearly as much as I anticipated from 32%. A truly unique and absolutely delicious beer that totally lives up to the hype. I would have no problem consuming a whole bottle of this over the course of a long winters evening, although it would be rude not to share...","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
4501,"2009-12-20",3.9,"Appearance:  Pours like dark roast coffee with no head.

Aroma:  Liquid smoke, bbq potato chips, rubber cement. The alcohol is so strong it burns the back of my nose.

Taste: Wood, what Id imagine paint to taste based on how it smells, soy sauce, M & Ms, barbecue sauce, toasted nuts,dark roasted coffee and burnt malts.

Mouthfeel: Warm and thick.

Overall: This beer was pretty over the top and obnoxious. This beer should steal the show at any tasting, and will actually warm you up quite a bit. I did not consume the entire bottle myself, and I dont think I could anyhow.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
4501,"2009-12-19",4.2,"WOW. Very full bottle, glad it didnt explode, shared between three people. Dont think a bottle each would have enabled a coherent review to be written! Bottle pours a viscous black oily beer, with absolutely no head. Aroma is predominantly smoke, with strong alcohol notes and underlying sweetness. Leaves greasy residue on side of glass. Thick tingling mouthfeel coats inside of mouth, imparting heavy flavours of wood, caramel, smoky, peaty whisky. A knockout, and a cracking nightcap.","Greater London, ENGLAND","NutRoastBad"
4501,"2009-12-16",4.1,"Ill qualify my rating by saying this was a one ounce sample poured to me by James from BrewDog while they were at the Flying Saucer in Houston, TX early in December.  The pour was black and viscous with a few brown bubbles sticking together on the peripheries.  The aroma was peat, smoked meats, alcohol, caramel and vanilla.  The flavor was a blend of salty and sweet.  Smoked meats up front gave way to a bit of caramel sweetness that was quickly snowed under by a surge of warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel was full bodied, thick and coating but never cloying.  The closest thing I could compare this too in terms of how if felt would be Triple Bock.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"
4501,"2009-12-14",3.9,"A hedonistic whiskey brew recommended for fans of Dark Island Reserve and Ola Dubh series. One killer beer. Shared many thanks with Magic Dave. I really appreciate the special tastings. The alcohol was heavy in epic poportions. Notes of caramel; roasted malts and coffee. However not too sure as I was too blown away by seeing it and the abv.

I tried to remember on the way home what my rating was. Ah thats a good beer and well worth seeking out to store away. Thank you Brew Dog for sticking it to the media yet again.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"
4501,"2009-12-14",4.4,"From bottle at BrewDog tasting, Oslo, Dec 09.
Smoke, tar and chocolate in the nose.
Treacle, tar, old ropes. Strong alcohol, yet very hoppy. Liquorice, salt, brandy.
Smoke and fire in the finish.","Oslo, NORWAY","KnutAlbert"
4501,"2009-12-10",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2009 Bottle many thanks to james, had in the rake. Alround rating: Holy shit smash the granny! Massive, smokehead is clear, barrel aging is tit blasting. Alcohol seems hiden then in the finish comes and punches you in the tear well, but your half in half between crying with joy and pain. Win on a level that i want to punch myself?","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"
