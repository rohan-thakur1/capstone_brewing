744,"2016-04-05",3.7,"May 7th, 2014 - Auto-correct is convinced that Bier is Beer, but whatever the name, this is a gripping kolsch. ItÂ’s a style I donÂ’t see much, and it might catch a break and be trendy one year, like todayÂ’s gose or yesterdayÂ’s black IPA, but for now, it seems to live in relative obscurity. StoneÂ’s Sprocket is a great reason to bring it out into the light. Dark and still, it looks like a lake at night, with an aroma defined by heavy sugary molasses notes. Second and third sniffs take in hickory smoke and jerky too, with lots of aromas to remind me of grilled meats, charring and turning into something special through the magic of the maillard reaction. The flavor is equally delicious and appetizing, though a little sweeter, especially cold and fresh from the bottle. Carbonation helps activate the flavors, too, though softens considerably in the aftertaste, where I can focus on the bits of flavor that remind me of burnt ends. Quenching yet flavorful, this is a surprising but excellent beer, and has pointed me to the rich possibilities of the kolsch style.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

744,"2015-12-21",3.5,"Bomber purchased 18 months ago at the BevMo in Escondido ($7.49). Pours dark brown and almost black with the faintest of red highlights along the edges and one finger of dark beige foam. AROMA of wet dog (weird), dark roasted malts, dark rye bread, and black coffee. FLAVOR of dark roasted and kind of burnt malts, sharp rye, burnt dark bread, a little bit of sour grains, and some hints of coffee. Thin mouthfeel and light body with a dry finish. I suppose the brewers succeeded in what they intended to do here, but I donÂ’t really think I need to experience a black rye Kolsch again. (365, 995)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
744,"2015-11-19",3.5,"Rating #1293 - 21.10.2014 - Stone launch @craftbeeryeg. This was a dark brown/black coloured pour with a mild tan foam that faded to a ring. Nose was teddy graham cookies, chocolate, toffee, and vegetable oil. Mild alcohol warmth and carbonation (well disguised at 6.6%) Taste is lagery, a mild peppery smokiness from the rye grain, mild toffee and caramel malt sweetness, but a load of noble hop grassiness. Finishes smooth, and super light - the dark roast malt notes coming through clean, crisp, kolsch-esque. Strange.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"
744,"2015-11-19",3.5,"Pours a cloudy dark chocolate brown color that appears pitch black and completely opaque in the glass. Two finger pillowy beige head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Good retention, taking a while to settle and leaving streaks of soapy lacing in itÂ’s path. 

Slightly earthy, robust dark malt aroma with a nice balance of roast, spice, grassy hops and sweet malt. Delicate smoke character with hints of charcoal, burnt toast, dark chocolate and deeply roast coffee bean. ThereÂ’s also some subtle spicy rye in the nose but this is overpowered by the strong malt presence. The earthier/hoppier kolsch notes come through, however, with some grassy saaz character, pine needle and dank resins. Smells more like an American black ale and I probably wouldnÂ’t have been able to guess that this was a kolsch if I didnÂ’t read it on the bottle. 

Fuller bodied than expected with a bit more of a kolsch flavor profile but the prominent dark malt bill, resinous hops and subtle spice make it feel more like an experimental ABA. Strong hop presence with sticky hop oils, earthy pine needle, grass and spruce tip flavor that linger throughout into a bone dry finish. Slightly acrid but the roast isnÂ’t as extreme as in the nose. Hints of charcoal, burnt toast, coffee grounds and bittersweet dark chocolate countered by sweeter malt flavors and faint spicy rye. Again, the rye is subtle but it nicely compliments the earthy hop bitterness. Decent balance with low ABV and light mouthfeel make this beer pretty easy to drink. Nothing too out of the ordinary but itÂ’s an interesting take on the style.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

744,"2014-12-18",3.2,"IÂ’m torn about how to rate this. From the standpoint of a kolshch, itÂ’s got very little in common with the style beyond a fairly light mouthfeel. Putting aside kolsch expectations and taking it as a beer, itÂ’s pretty enjoyable -- probably closer to a black IPA. LetÂ’s got with the later. Pours a very dark, nearly black brown from a bomber into a tuip. Nose is bready, slightly yeasty and roasted malts -- smells like porter. Taste is lighter than expected from the nose, light and bouncy, with an expected Stone hops bite. Finishes with lingering hops and a return of roasted malts. Overall, a black IPA-porter blend.","West Hartford, USA","Slubgob"

KÃ¶lsch? How the hell is this a KÃ¶lsch? This looks, smells, and drinks like an extremely mild schwarzbier. The only characteristics it shares with a KÃ¶lsch are that itÂ’s wet with relatively low ABV. I mean, seriously, rated as a KÃ¶lsch, itÂ’s pretty much a zero. I dunno, guess I have to rate it on its own merits, instead of as a KÃ¶lsch. Even on its own merits, though, itÂ’s probably the worst Stone beer IÂ’ve ever had. (10/20)","CANADA","UXO"

This seems to have some really nice flavors that are trying to get out but just canÂ’t. I taste citrus throughout. A bitterness that Ron called raspberries could be zest. Later a hint of tobacco emerged. This has a really nice rich smooth feel to it. This would be a great intro to craft beer. Those who say they donÂ’t like ""dark beers"" should try this.

744,"2014-08-09",3.4,"Sampled May 2014
A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a three-finger thick, richly browned, dark tan colored head. The beer is a rich black color that is almost opaque when held up to the light, but does show a clear, rich, dark black-purple hue if held up directly to the light. The aroma smells of spicy, blackened whole grain up front, but this is backed by a fruitiness that leans towards, berries or perhaps a touch of apples (though not really). The malt is quite the dominant note in the nose though, spicy rye, bitter roasted cold coffee, burnt, browned, whole grain toasted, brown grain bread.

The body is light up front, but picks up a fullness towards the finish that allows it to have a creamy sort of texture to it. Bitter roasted grain husk notes, the beer is actually quite dry, an almost oily black malt character, bitter concentrated coffee notes, and some smoother, rounded dark malt notes that adds a richness, some burnt smokiness, and a bit of tartness from the ample roast character.

This is a simple, roast focused beer that is quite expressive in its burnt character; if you like that sort of thing, which I do, it manages to remain well balanced despite the simple focus, and there is enough layering to it that it remains interesting.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Bold and yet reserved, the brew has all the spice and caramel one would expect from a black lager with a clean mouthfeel and lots of depth.

Roasted head lingers long on this chocolatey dark beer.

Aroma: The aroma is dry and roasted malts, some smoke notes, ash, and a bit of rye

The aroma offers up chocolate malts, light citrus hops, spicy hops and then smooth smelling dark roasted maltiness. Very different aroma but it fits together nicely. The taste starts with a pleasing mix of dark roasted malts, a dash of chocolate malts and then bitter hops that build into sort of a lime and bitter floral hoppiness. The hop bitterness and the malt dark roastiness merge toward the finish in a complimentary manner. This is pretty crisp and stays far away from the sweet dreadful over sweet Kolsch that is all too common with American (failed) attempts at the style.

A slight roasted malt bite hits the tip of tongue as it enters the mouth - a feeling and flavor that carries onto the top of the tongue and hovers at the roof of the mouth after itÂ’s gone down the hatch. A dryness takes over in the finish, and the tongue ends up a little wasted with notes of charred roast malts. ItÂ’s really refreshing and light-bodied for such a charred, dry drink.

744,"2014-06-03",3.9,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass; worn off bottle date, but bottled in 4/2014. Pours crystal clear nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, toast, dark bread, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, spicy rye, light char, herbal, light fruitiness, light grass, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hop, and light-moderate kolsch yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, light fruitiness, herbal, grass, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, light fruitiness, grass, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with a great roasted malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice experimental Kolsch style beer. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; it tastes a lot like a robust porter.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

744,"2014-06-02",3.6,"Served on tap in a chalice glass 
Appearance Â– The beer is served a nearly pitch black color with a one finger head of off white foam. The head has a moderate level of retention fading slowly to leave some streaky lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell Â– The aroma is heaviest of a darker roasted malt smell mixed with some char and chocolate, bringing both a slightly burnt but somewhat sweet aroma to the nose. Along with these aromas are other malty smells of rye mixed with a little bit of a pine hop smell.
Taste Â– The taste begins with a nice roasted malt flavor mixed with a rather decent sum of a char and a light cocoa flavor. It begins rather dry with it gaining a little bit of sweetness as the flavor advances with some caramel and chocolate coming to the tongue. These sweeter flavors are later dampened as flavors of a light rye bread and some charcoal and smoke come to the tongue toward the end. In the end, with all the flavor transitions that had occurred on the tongue, one is left with a mostly dry and somewhat roasty and charred flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel Â– The body of the beer is rather light with a carbonation level that is rather high. Fairly good for the easy drinking feel of the brew, but a little weak for the smoky, darker, and rye flavors, so overall just OK.
Overall Â– A decently charred and toasty tasting brew with a lighter palate and easy drinking feel. A pretty nice kolsh.","","Darkmagus82"

744,"2014-05-13",3.6,"22 ounce bottle - LuckyÂ’s Beverage World in Woodstock, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a very dark brown, near black body with a few glimmers of amber when held against the light. Though not particularly tall, the creamyish, mocha-toned head is lasting.

Smell: Coffee-toned roasted malt, a gently meaty smokiness invades the nostrils, and toasted homemade German dark rye bread for an overall earthy nose. Some chocolate, some grape, too.

Taste: Roasted grain, flecks of darkened nuts and burnt rye bread. A little smoke, a little spice. Faint chocolate. Ample sweetness. A fruitiness that sneaks in hinting of grape. The smoke-induced roast and spice carry you through the end of the near-crisp finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. A bit above medium carbonation. Smooth, creamyish mouthfeel.

Overall: Fairly satisfying. Yes, I understand this a tinkered-with, augmented Kolsch, but, I hoped that didnÂ’t mean totally tossing out the refreshing spirit of the beer out the window.

Starts off with rich, roasted wood aromas rise off a jet black body with a light brown head. The front of the sip seems like itÂ’s going to be an immense stout-like beer with creamy dark chocolate and dry roasted coffee flavors, but it quickly evaporates into a lighter body and Schwarzbier style beer. ThereÂ’s a smokiness to this thatÂ’s really nice and not overpowering, well balanced with the chocolaty sweetness. ThereÂ’s an overriding bitterness, but itÂ’s hard to tell if itÂ’s from hops or from roasted grain. In the end, the chocolate and dry roasted coffee/wood flavors hang around and again make this seem like a bigger beer than it is.

Good stuff overall, canÂ’t really say it reminds me too much of a Kolsch though.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

744,"2014-04-27",3.0,"Bottle, pours blackish brown with good lacing and small off white head. Aromas are bread, milk chocolate, marshmallow malt. Taste is mellow German hops, vanilla, malt, and other German things. The color is just weird and it tastes more like a brown. Not that good.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
744,"2014-04-27",3.2,"22 from greens. Very light on the black part of this drink and much more reliant on a kolsch. Pour is dark with a quick but noticeable tan head. Aroma is a little roasty malt. Flavor has a touch of the same but much more light toasty grain. Light bitter finish. Ok.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
744,"2014-04-27",3.8,"22oz bomber, bottled on 04/21/14. Supposed to be available in all states that Stone distributes. I know it isnÂ’t a true kÃ¶lsch, but the brewer says it is. Whatever. Deep cola brown with a medium beige, one finger head. Tiny bubbles, good enough retention. Nose is mainly rye and some toasty malt. Also a bit yeasty, but doesnÂ’t really seem kÃ¶lsch-y to me. OK, I think I get it it the flavor, though. Interesting! Pretty dry, my nose is a touch stuffy so IÂ’m not getting any hops til the end, which were herbal and green. Otherwise itÂ’s as in the aroma--rye and toasty malt dominant. More hops as it warms. Dry finish, bitterness peaked at a 3. Light body with light to moderate smooth carbonation. Tasty.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
744,"2014-04-27",2.8,"650ml bottle. Ridiculous style but I guess thatÂ’s how Stone likes it. Over hopped for the ""style"".","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
744,"2014-04-26",3.5,"22oz bottle pours a thick black color with a bit of brown head. Lots of roasted malt, but the flavor dies away quickly leaving a plainer lager flavor. Smooth and easy going.","California, USA","Bule"
744,"2014-04-26",3.3,"The aroma is heavy on the rye, smokey, roasted elements. The head pours heavy with moderate lacing. It is almost black with a mocha colored head. The taste has flavors of rye, breads, spices, and bitter coffee.","Pinehurst, North Carolina, USA","hman43"
744,"2014-04-26",3.4,"22oz bomber from Spirits Brick. Poured a great looking deep dark Tootsie Roll brown under a larger dense creamy deep beige head. Aroma of sweet syrupy chocolate, cola, soy sauce, burnt toast and some odd bologna product. Medium to thinner bodied with light csrbonation and a quick fsding aftertaste. Flavor better than the aroma, with some light chocolate, dark malts, grains, brown bread, cola. Okay but was hoping for more.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
744,"2014-04-26",3.1,"Aroma brings simple black malts, smokey ham, yeasty funk and spices. Appears a chalky black with a thin foam rim. Taste is almost.....tasteless. Really plain and watery with extremely faint notes of charcoal, cocoa, toffee and espresso. Overall, this is really disappointing to me. ItÂ’s really watery and the only flavors I really get are diluted chocolate, smoke, ham and toffee (but they are all extremely faint flavors) Not sure what Stone was doing.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
744,"2014-04-25",3.8,"Pours black with a two finger tan head with nice lacing. Aroma is of chocolate, rye bread, sweet malts, roasted malts, and some light grassy hops. Taste is similar to the aroma but is slightly hoppier and as some pine and earthiness to it. Has a medium body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a slightly bitter, medium finish. Overall, a very interesting and pretty tasty hybrid beer that seems like a cross between a stout and kolch.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
744,"2014-04-25",3.8,"Bottle thanks to Alemax. Pours dark brown with tan head, settles in minutes with moderate lacing. Aroma is lightly smoky, chocolatey, roasted malt, toffee, bitter rye.

Soft carbonation, medium body, and smooth texture.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Brouwerij"
744,"2014-04-25",3.3,"Poured as a taster at local shop. I had some perry and peach cider in the glass before that and while it was rinsed, I had what appears to be anomalous aromas compared to all the other comments IÂ’ve seen, but I guess IÂ’ll go with it. Aroma - really citrusy, lots of lemon, with a touch of rye and dark malt (this lemon aroma that was so prevalent in my tasting seems to be the strange part). Taste of brow and chocolate malt with that classic Kolsch flavor somehow underneath. For once, not a giant pile of hops from Stone and I like this better than most of their gigantic pile of hops beers.","Radford, Virginia, USA","BrettTaylor"
744,"2014-04-25",3.8,"Bottle pour in pilsener glass. Much darker than I originally expected. Aroma has a slightly smokey tinge to it. Texture is really smooth, and the rye augments the Kolsch flavor very nicely.","Arizona, USA","asceticbrewer"
744,"2014-04-25",3.7,"Aroma is dark bread, dark malts and mildly spicy. The flavor is dark malts/grains, mild spicy notes, light citrus, a hint of dark bread and a thick and mildly sour finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"

744,"2014-04-25",3.4,"650 ml. bottled 03/08/2014. Opaque black with a lasting disc of cream on top. Nose is nearly scorched whole grain bread, coffee grounds and an underlying malted chocolate that provides just a touch of sweetness. Dominant tastes of barely sweetened coffee, bitter dry cocoa, mint and ash. Flashes of caramel cola, peppery rye, resin and green herb. Near-medium body is well balanced and smoothly carbonated but a bit too astringent.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

744,"2014-04-24",3.6,"Pours dark brown with a bit of a reddish tint and tan head. The aroma has cocoa, coffee, somewhat kolsch clean notes and a milk dud maltiness. It has a medium light body with modest carbonation. The flavor begins with roasty malt, coffee bitterness, spicy hops, dry rye spice and some clean crispness. The finish has a good amount of rye spice and spicy hops with still the roastiness. IÂ’m sure some kolsch rules were followed to give the name of the beer, but this comes across as a roastier schwartzbier or crisp stout. Still quite enjoyable.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

744,"2014-04-22",3.9,"A dark brown color with a nice khaki head with good lacing. Aroma of dark bread and mild chocolate with slight grassy hops and maybe hints of red fruit. Taste has some initial sweetness as well as some vanilla character. Mild chocolate and smokey/ashy taste with smooth roast, coffee and hint of rye spiciness. Just a mild bitterness and some grassy hop flavor in a mostly dry finish. Mouthfeel is silky with a light/medium body and moderate/high carbonation. All the flavors are really well balanced but add up to make the beer very flavorful and drinkable. An easy drinking dark summer beer. Like more than I expected.","Missouri, USA","jeremyh70"
