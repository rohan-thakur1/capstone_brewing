1838,"2012-09-13",3.7,"Bottle shared by Lunch. Thanks for leaving half of the bottle for me even though I hit my threshold and fell asleep.

The beer is fairly hazy and light orange in color, with 1/2"" of creamy, white head that leaves some good lacing on the glass. The aroma brings malt, light caramels, floral notes, and subtle spice. The flavor is malt forward, with a healthy floral presence, and caramel malt flavors. The finish brings some hop bitterness to round things out, though malt flavors take over once again, lingering on the palate between sips. Alcohol content is hidden well. The sweet nature of the style precludes me from wanting a second helping. Overall, a decent beer and a solid example of the style. Recommended.

Then the alcohol hits, you can tell its alcohol, but the ""sweetness"" of the alcohol seems to the most notable characteristic, light dark fruit notes (possibly fusel alcohol), along with some overripe banana. After the initial wave of alcohol it calms down a bit with a nice sweet grain, spicy hop finish. Palate is medium bodied, syrupy on entry, then immediately drying from the intense alcohol rush. Even though at first this beer was a bit like drinking a heavy lager with a shot of Irish Whiskey sitting at the bottom I wound up thoroughly enjoying it by the time I was done with my glass.

1838,"2011-01-17",3.7,"Enjoyed from a 22oz bomber in a wine glass.  The beer pours a copper/medium brown color, with a smallish white head.  The nose shows Germanic Munich and CaraMunich malt character.  As the bottle had been aged for some time, hop character had essentially totally dropped out of the aroma.  The palate gives an extremely pleasing note of residual continental character malt sweetness; supported by a crackery underlying pilsner malt character, and just enough carbonation to lift the flavors off the palate; allowing the sample to remain highly drinkable.  A noticeable-if-light hop bitterness does come in; falling short of balancing the malt, but adding complexity and keeping the beer from being too sweet for the style.  The finish leaves a very pleasant note of residual sweetness on the palate.  Overall, a excellent version of the style, and a steal, for the price.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

1838,"2009-05-15",4.3,"The bomber was artfully labeled, evoking memories of renaissance era Europe.  The beer came out golden deep yellow with a good stream of carbonation, but a small to nonexistent head.  The smell was malty and yeasty, with some floral hops.  The taste is where it all came together, as the malts, hops, and yeast proved to be in great balance.  The honey like sweetness was pitted against an earthy and drying yeast flavor and spiced up with restrained but noticeable noble hops.  The mouthfeel was a lot fuller than most of the Maibocks Ive ever had, but it was not so full that it went out of style and became a Dopplebock.  The carbonation was quite evident in the mouth.  This was a wonderfully drinkable beer without having to be watered down.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

1838,"2008-06-06",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Soothing floral, herbal hoppiness is perfectly levelled with honeyed cereals in a come-hither mouthfeel where earthy yeast and herbal hop bitterness encourage you to take an even greater sip. This is as authentic a Bock as you can find in North America.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A lingering cloud of foam garnishes the hazy amber.
-Balance is achieved throughout.
-Such authenticity and quality makes me wish theyd brew a Pilsener now!
-The frothy bubbling and healthy mouthfeel are pleasant all the way.
-Alcohol never shows in the flavor profile; this is as drinkable as any other unfiltered lager.
-Close to a year-old, it reveals nice biscuity, caramelized sugars. It changes but does not tire, it seems. A nice evolution.

Moderately thick, full, chewy, upright and solid on the palate, with a sweet fruitiness and and a mild but noticeable twang that seems to lighten the entire experience and give the drinking session liveliness.

The nose is malty heavy and slightly resinous with hints of toast, toffee, cherries, and just a pinch of sharp hops. Mouthfeel is moderately dense and pleasingly coating. I find a few similarities here to a barleywine. Something about the sweet, brown sugar flavor and vinous qualities. . .Modest suggestions at a German lager are made and intertwine oddly well with the fruity, dense malt character. Very, very nice interpretation of this style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1838,"2007-08-20",4.0,"Pumpkin yellow in color. Tightly packed white head clings nicely with each gulp. Minerals, peach marmalade and cookie-like Munich entice the olfactory senses. Delightfully perfumey and honeyish. Natural carbonation is fluffy on the palate. Firm and snappy Munich malt is immediately enhanced by a delicate phenolic bite and a hint of pineapple which buoys and complements the sweet and well-textured malts. Assertive yet clean hop bitterness is lush and fairly oily. Alcohol is nary a factor, but does impart some nice peppery warmth as well as accentuating the bitterness. Very cleanly attenuated, and the scant marmalade and baked apple fruitiness which remains, beautifully dovetails with the fresh hay and honeyed-biscuit Munich quality. Exemplary overall balance. A limpness begins to tarnish a bit of the malt definition halfway through the bottle. Deeply dextrinous and compact malt frame merges with a lime-accented bitterness at the finish and a sweet honey-glazed pear flavor which lingers. This is quite the lively example, as its rather phenolic and estery. The bottle conditioning does an especially fine job of cradling the flavors. Another commendable effort by Smutty.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Big patches and rings of foamy lacing. Flavor of pine over caramel but I think the pine wins. Almost big IPA-like. Not that its tons of hops but I think the malt takes a back seat when a great bock should be richly malty. The flavor also has notes of  honey, hay and vanilla and is a little hot esp. in finish.

Smuttynose Maibock finishes with more of those sweet malty nutty and toasty flavors, and ends with a slightly cloying, and warming burn.

Sweet and bold to the nose.  Flavor?  Yes.  Rich, sweet caramel paired with vanilla butter cream.  Unfiltered aspect lends itself to a grainy, toasted complex.  Its somewhat of a conundrum to detail individual flavors because everything is in harmony  nice and smooth.  Some jumpy hops liven things up and give a touch of bitterness.  Carbonation, malts and hops are well-proportioned but equally bold.  Chewy malts and big-bodied.  No, better yet, this beer is fat.  Finish is creamy vanilla custard and some cackled pepper here and there.  Dry, caramel chew aftertaste.  Smuttynose continues to impress the hell out of me.

1838,"2005-04-30",4.2,"Bottle-conditioned, hazy with the yeast shot, earthy amber topped by a generous diminishing, but lacing off-white head. Pleasant fresh deep malt nose. It is even more expressive in mouth, probably more intense than a traditional maibock, but the way those flavors are displayed and coming up together is worth driving a few ultra miles (oh no.. actually ClarkVV brought that to me from liquorinos, thanks Clark!). A blend of citrus (pinneaple mostly, but also orange blossom and other fruits like peaches) and creamy, bready honey. Excellent demonstration of the power of toasted malt. It almost comes out with smoky hints, I truly want to see Smuttynose trying a smoked beer.. Yummy that would be. The toasted aspects shine in here, creating a chewy biscuit aspect working together with the bitterness. Globally sweet though drying out adequately toward the end. Quaffable medium body with excellent moderately high carbonation. 7.7%, are you kidding? I could have downed this bomber in less than 5 minutes. Plenty of earthy, floral and herbal scents from the hops. A soldier worthy of every markmanship awards!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Flavor has just the perfect balance of malt sweetness and mixes with a mild and soily/earthy hops profile that is just right.  The yeast and hops together add a perfect balancing bitterness, this beer has a soft smooth body and is just supremely drinkable and good.

Nose is soft, dry, vegetal/herbal, leaning into a certain sweetness. Very stately and assure.
Taste is rich and full, fresh with a bright fruity quality, berries and apples, and such, but that loses hold, as the flavor feels more coppery and buttery at swallows end. Maltiness reigns supreme here, and hops entertain a mere tingle at the fore. Body is medium, at best, and the finish is long, flavorful, and ultimately dry. 
An interesting maibock, one that I think I like...this is sophisticated, truly mature, not oversome in flavorful and sweet, buttery malt, but, rather, like Baby Bears hand-me-downs, ju-ust right.

Nose is loaded, I mean loaded with caramel malt, and malted milk as well.  Flavor again super sweet/malty; those looking for hops in their bocks had best avoid.  Finish extremely smooth, perhaps a bit too much; but overall this is a great sweet, full-bodied maibock.  Makes me miss Ayinger just a little less...","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1838,"2002-06-04",3.6,"It pours with a foamy head and a clear dark orange body.  Slightly sweet, with a nice aftertaste.  Heavy malt character without a lot of hops.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
1838,"2002-05-19",3.5,"No hops taste and very little carbonation, but still seemed very chewey.  Lots of malt character.  I agree with their slogan: Make mine a Smutty!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
1838,"2002-05-16",3.4,"Nice palate, hardly carbonated at all, slightly creamy.  Very malty with a lot of flavour.  Well balanced despite no obvious hops.","Pullman, Washington, USA","Merc"
1838,"2002-05-16",3.5,"Pretty good beer.  Nice inbetween winter and spring beer.  Very malty, and rich.  Slight hops flavor in the finish to balance it out.  Decent palate, nice color.","Pullman, Washington, USA","Gregory"
1838,"2002-05-15",3.9,"Wonderful malty, chewy Maibock.  Nice alcohol at the end, this is a very good spring or any time of the year beer.","McKinleyville, California, USA","gwfrankpsu"
1838,"2002-04-15",3.6,"The beer pours with a deep bronze color and a sandy off-white head color. Has a big malty sweet nose and a touch of alcohol in the aroma as well. The malt has an aroma of a chocolate milkshake. Very smooth, full, chewy and alightly bitter mouthfeel. Slightly sharp alcohol tinge on the back of the throat. A wonderful Maibock, make mine a Smutty!","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"
1838,"2002-04-09",3.9,"So very very malty.  Starts over with a gorgeous, pretty clear, ruby-tinted color.  The aroma was made me think of some kind of fruity bread (raspberry maybe), but left me a little curious.  Malts come on stong with initial flavor and dominate the aftertaste as well.  Hops, an carbonation, were hardly noticeable.  It does get a bit alcoholic as it warms, but not that bad.  Its definately a beer one needs to enjoy, taking their time.  Nice stuff.","New York, USA","Steak"
1838,"2002-04-01",3.5,"This beer presents a sweet nutty/malty nose.  A full bodied beer with a decent balance of chocolate malt and finishing hops.  A pleasant beer that will make you feel warm.  Cheers!","Nottingham, New Hampshire, USA","turtlehead"
