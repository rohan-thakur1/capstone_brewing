2619,"2016-09-20",3.0,"500 ml bottle. Pours clear dark golden with small fine head. Sweet aroma of dough and caramel with a hint of banana. Taste starts sweet and a bit wheaty, after that caramel kicks in and the finish is slightly bitter. No sourness at all. Easy to drink, medium body, enjoyable but nothing special.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","malushky"
2619,"2016-05-20",3.7,"Bottle from the brewery shop in Lewes. Smooth grainy beginning. Nice malty ale aromatic, smooth grainy, crisp with an easy drinking body. Not too long in the aftertaste, round and fresh. Malt, round and nice ale characteristic. Long mild malty aftertaste, grain, smooth, nice!","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"

2619,"2015-03-13",2.3,"Clear darkish orange. Not so fresh malty aroma. Taste is slightly sweet, malty, maybe slight wheat in the background.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","nihtila"
2619,"2015-03-13",3.2,"Bottle from Harveys online.
Appearance - amber with a decent fluffy head. 
Nose - very delicate banana. More malt than expected.
Taste - more of the same.
Palate - close to medium bodied with a tangy yet creamy texture and a fairly dry finish.
Overall - solid if not true to the style.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
2619,"2015-03-13",3.1,"Bottle at AshtonMcCobbs. Pours clear gold with a thin white head. Aromas of light banana, malt. Taste is sweet, bready, banana. Missing some spice notes. Sweet finish.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","allmyvinyl"
2619,"2015-03-13",3.1,"Bottle at ashs. Pours clear amber, nose is banana, light citrus, toffee, taste is similar, sweet, dry.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Stuu666"
2619,"2014-11-23",2.9,"Bottle from Middle Farm. It pours clear amber with a medium, foamy white head. The nose is toasty, wheat, brown bread, cereal and earth. The taste is bitter, earthy, toasty, mouldy bread, must, weetabix, earth and grassy hops with a drying finish. Medium body and average carbonation. Cant say I love the style. Smells decent, but lacks some punch in the flavour department.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
2619,"2014-04-19",3.8,"Very sweet fruity aroma. Golden amber colour. Very slight head. Quite hoppy taste. Fruity undertones.

2619,"2011-11-29",2.9,"50cl bottle picked up in Hastings. Amber-gold in colour with a fast fading cream head; the aroma has German hops, some light coriander spice and some musty grains; unfortunately the taste is a bit of a let down - stewed, slightly lactic, malts; then a rather sticky caramel finish. Probably a lot better as a cask ale!","Bracknell, Berkshire, ENGLAND","berkshirejohn"
2619,"2011-09-02",3.3,"Rating from an old notebook. Golden coloured, sparkling clear, thin white head. Doughy, wheaty aroma. Very smooth with carbonation that is neither too soft nor too prickely, bready, wheaty, caramel. Characteristic Harveys flavour from their yeast. A very good reasonably unique beer.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Joeh"
2619,"2011-08-02",3.4,"Bottle.
Clear honey amber with a short creamy bubbly off white head that leave some lace.

Sweet caramel malty aroma with some wheat and hops. A bit weak smell.

Taste is sweet caramel with some wheat, oranges, peach and flowery hops. 

Medium body with soft but nice carbonation.

Tasty! More of an english pale ale with some wheat notes and a good hoppiness.

2619,"2010-01-15",3.1,"A Mes rate. Bottle from the glorious Harveys shop in Lewes.Copper coloured with a decent off white head. Lots of toffee and and a faint oxidised character. Pleasantly grainy, unusually so, and a resonable bitterness in the finish. Not bad.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
2619,"2009-06-09",3.3,"500ml bottle from the brewery shop, and drunk out of the special Harveys sampling glass bought on the tour. Soft wheat flavour with a touch of sweetness, and the funky signature tones of the Harveys yeast and hop blend. Touch of red wine in the swallow. Decent and tasty brew.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
2619,"2008-05-24",3.0,"Cask at the Market Porter. Copper color with an off-white head. Unusual aroma. Flavor of wheat with a slight citric overlay. Not quite medium bodied. Smooth carbonation. Wheat isnt quite the same as barley. Growing on me though.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2619,"2007-09-30",3.4,"500ml bottle. Clear light amber with an impressive white head that subsides. Aroma is mainly wheat and even a meaty note. Sweet flavour with a drying palate as per the description. Overall, tastes like a weaker version of De Koninck.","Los Angeles, California, USA","Ethereal"
2619,"2007-06-22",3.2,"500ml bottle from the brewery shop.  Copper/amber colour with lasting beige head.  Cereal and toffee aroma.  Its fine, nice enough wheaty flavour, doesnt suffer too much from pasteurisation.  Drinkable goodish balanced hop on end.  Fine.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
2619,"2004-03-20",2.7,"Light dusty nose with a hint of honey, pale copper color, low fizzy head. Round sweet honeyish malt body. Little or no hop bitter but a light nut component in the background attempts to balance out the sweet caramel malt. Slightly oily mouthfeel and thin. Do think that by adding ""Copper"" to the name for the word ""wheat"" they are no longer obligated to offer the drinker anything a standard wheat has?","GERMANY","pivo"
2619,"2004-03-15",2.9,"Very clear amber with greenish shine; quite carbonated but everything got knocked out whilst pouring, leaving a white rim. Not only it looks, but also smells like an old, oxydised beer. But BBd is still 3 months away (nutty, port, cake, oxydised). Definitely prematurely aged beer. Nutty taste, bit of coloured malt, grain but no wheat. Retronasal typical biscuit. Conform to the rest, mouthfeel is very thin & tired. Something went quite wrong here, I'm not sure what. If this beer were 15 years old, I'd say it didn't age gracefully, probably because of its low ABV. But it isn't old. Even worse. It doesn't fulfill ONE SINGLE characteristic for an Hefeweizen. It's even filtered!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2619,"2004-03-07",2.7,"Light brown color, not really a head - malty nose with some orange but very light. Ligth taste. Very weak all in all.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
