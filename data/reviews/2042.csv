2042,"2016-06-19",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
This earthy, acidic farmhouse brew shares plenty of rusticity from aroma to finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy red.
-The flavor profile is a bit muddled.
-Drinkability is lower than I would like it to be.
-Acidity levels are perhaps higher than what I normally want.

2042,"2016-01-11",3.8,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is fruity with cherries, berries, raisin and prune. Some caramel and toasted bread notes. Light oak and acidity. A light brandy note. 
Pours brown with burnt amber hues and a medium sized, moderately thick, tan head that slowly hut steadily recedes to a film on the edges. Moderate lacing and medium small legs. 
Flavor has a medium light acidity. Moderately strong fruit notes with grapes, cherries, raisins and prunes. Some toasted bread and caramel notes add a bit of sweetness. A medium light, spicy herbal note. Some light oak and brandy notes with light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a touch of a watery note and moderate carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer but not an amazing beer. I think the acidity and fruit character is too strong and drowns out the malt a bit too much.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
