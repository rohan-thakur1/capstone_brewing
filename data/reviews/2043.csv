2043,"2016-08-22",4.3,"Cest sans doute la dernière bière de beloeil que je dégustais! Celle-ci sappelant dorénavant Moinette Ambrée. Personnellement, je regretterai son étiquette présentant le château de Beloeil lui donnant un côté désuet salliant très bien avec le côté terroir de cette bière. Visuellement la bière présente une magnifique robe ambrée (légèrement opaque pour ma bouteille), une effervescence intense et une épaisse mousse blanc-cassé. Au nez, sexpriment en priorité les arômes de malt, de caramel, sucre candi. Lutilisation de 5 malts différents donnent à cette bière une riche complexité et des variations des plus intéressantes. La première attaque, très discrète est maltée. Très rapidement arrive une très belle et longue amertume. Les arômes de confiture dabricot, de caramel sur des nuances tourbées et maltées donnent à la bière de beloeil à la fois rondeur et rusticité. Le final, long se termine sur des notes alcooliques et sèches, très caractéristique de la brasserie Dupont, qui comme à son habitude maîtrise parfaitement la puissance de 8,5 % Abv. Essayez là sur un camembert au lait cru, bien affiné...une merveille! PS : si quelquun peu méclairer sur son référencement en tant que bière de garde?","FRANCE","jybi"

Belgian character is straightforward. Quite citrusy, mellow nose with dominating malt. In the first taste it is fairly dry, then there is a lot of malty sweetness. Everything is nicely contrasted with belgian, little phenolic, spicy character. Carbonation is medium, goes well with mouthfeel. After heating the beer, alcohol becomes noticable, but still very nicely hidden in compare to its real content. Very good biere de garde.","","reli"

Hops have mostly faded at this point (3 years of age). Some oxidation noted, though its not cardboard-like, just adds more vanilla and mixing with the special B (I think?), it adds a sweet sherry tone. Interesting. The ultra dry, plasticy esters dont really work as well here as they do with the dry, spicy hops and honey pils malt of their pale beers.Sweet caramel and vanilla and a bit of bittersweet raisin and some acidity wash over the palate. Hop bitterness and black pepper phenols do dry the palate somewhat, but its still quite malty and somewhat ""thick"". As with the 2011 Monks stout I just had, Im guessing this hasnt aged wonderfully. Probably needs all the hop flavor and bitterness it can get to balance out this rich maltiness.

2043,"2013-08-15",5.0,"Bière de château dont la recette date déjà de 25 ans, mais avec toute lexpérience et le 
savoir-faire de cette brasserie Dupont. On est admiratif des recettes de cette brasserie...
Bouteille de 75 cl, bouchonnée de liège, à létiquette sobre (même si cest un produit de château,
et quel château ), confirmant ainsi que cette brasserie sattache beaucoup plus à ses bières
quau marketing détiquette, mais on le savait parfaitement.... 
Niveau dalcool abv : 8,5 %.
Couleur roux moyen superbe. Clarté pure, clean. Bulles moyennes par milliers, présentes dans
le moindre mm du verre. (déjà lexplosion à louverture était très belle, mais on en a la 
confirmation visuelle dans son verre...)
Mousse beige claire à cratères magnifiques du type trappiste....
Arômes de lie de vin, prune, poire, malts divers (il y en a 5!!!!) dont le caramel, candi, cassonade,
amandes.
1ère bouche à la très belle prise veloutée sur des épices fortes, de la muscade, du poivre et de la
girofle. Arrière-bouche maltée et un peu tourbée, à lamertume soutenue.
2ème nez de miel de châtaigne.
2ème bouche assez vineuse, mais à la très grande arrière-bouche maltée.
3ème nez tourbé.
3ème bouche pleine, complète, dans le style pain complet et fruits très mûrs.
Arrière-bouche du type dune brune extra-forte.
Longueur à la densité énorme et à la grande ampleur. Arrière-bouches remarquables.
Levure dense, forte, prenante, qui a tout dune grande.
Alcool magnifique, à la progression linéaire, constante : un soutien parfait au goût.
Finale immense. Un sommet brassicole : malt/fruit/bois/levure.
Conclusion : à défaut dabbaye réelle de la moinette (ce qui est dommage, mais un fait 
historique même sil y a eu une cense et un moulin ...), cette bière fera parfaitement office de bière de château. Pour lanecdote, le sceau « abbaye de la moinette » figure encore au bas de létiquette,
comme les bières ont pu sappeler au départ  mais ce nest plus quune nostalgie...
Ceci dit, « bière de château » est très bien aussi !!! (cfr par exemple la Kasteel  qui en est 
bien fière...). La recette de 1988 est parfaite pour une bière de château, elle est très noble,
avec lemploi de 5 malts et un superbe équilibre général.
Petite suggestion personnelle : dans lesprit dune dégustation Dupont au sommet, pour obtenir
un résultat certain, je propose de remplacer
la moinette brune par cette bière de Beloeil, de façon à avoir un ensemble blonde et brune
avec une cote maximale  (et il y a dailleurs dautres choix pour la note maxi  quelle
brasserie merveilleuse!!!).","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"
2043,"2013-08-13",3.1,"Appearance: amber-orange pour, slightly cloudy, with a thick, creamy light tan head and average lacing.  Aroma: very herbal, with notes of grass, basil, dandelion; decent caramel malt base underneath; good dose of yeasty spice connoting black pepper and a hint of clove. Taste: surprisingly hoppy and herbal at first sip, some slightly boozy caramel malts crest nicely to balance into some sweetness complemented by the slightly funky yeast.  Finish: tingly, with a slight booze note and the powerful herbal character combining to numb my mouth and upper throat. Notes: Not a bad beer; Dupont seems to be incapable of that. Nevertheless, not my favorite of theirs. Though the alcohol was reasonably well hidden, the flavors and palate seemed a little too big for the style, and the herb garden character was just a bit too much for my taste.  Bottle from the Rare Beer Club.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

Taste is sweet up front, a little spicy with a short, very slight bitter end culminating in a surprisingly dry finish. Medium body, avg verging on soft carbonation with very fine bubbles; velvety smooth texture. Overall: beautiful. Dupont never disappoints. I'm a sucker for beers leaning to maltiness, making this possibly my favorite Dupont to date. I will always have a place for this at my table.

2043,"2013-07-06",3.8,"A soft pour into my teku glass produces a three finger thick, nice tan colored head. The beer is a bright amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, gold tinged, light amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma is a mix of sweet grain, earthy spice notes, complementary fruit character, a nice yeasty mustiness, and a touch of hop character. Specifically the nose reminds me of soft, citrus zest, and earthy, musty spice character and musty hay like grain note, as well as an earthy whole grain cracker like aroma, and perhaps even a touch of dried weed like notes as well as a spicy floral character is noticeable. The nose is quite complex and interesting, definitely a beer that I can enjoy smelling for quite some time.
 
Quite effervescent and even foamy as it first hits my tongue, this plays up a spiciness due to the peppery carbonic bite. The beer is fairly light bodied, though does have some viscosity to it that is noticeable under the bubbly effervescence. The beer has a spiciness to it that is peppery, a bit floral, is phenolic, though not overly clove like, definitely earthy, and a bit musty. The malt character is a touch grassy, definitely has a whole grain cracker character to it, and perhaps a chewy bread like note at times. The yeast character in this is quite prominent, though it does not come through quite as brightly as it does in the paler malt focused Saison.
 
Not bad, well truly it is quite good, though I am perhaps a touch more critical because this beer is from Dupont. Still this has quite the complexity, and is deep and sort of rich in a way that keeps this light and quaffable beyond what a beer of this strength should be.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Copper pour, long-lived head. What a nose! Metallic Dupont delight distilled. Yes, there is some stewed vegetable in there, which drops this shy of shy of a 10 on first encounter (as I finish the bottle, the aroma drops another point or two with sweet spices coming on too strong). Alcohol is relatively subdued when cold -- Id have called it at about 7% based on my first sips--though as it warms one can pick it up and were in Avec territory.  Full of meaty, savory flavors relative to the other Dupont offerings. On the negative side, it comes off too sweet for my taste (grilled summer corn), especially as I move into the second half of the bottle. I like it, but didnt need 25 oz of it. A good beer, but not a thing of transcendent brilliance like Vieille Provision, Avril, or even Avec.

Big Belgian head is sadly diminishing leaving but a ring of white. Nutty praline and sulphury burst up first; warming, oddly buttery with hints of dodgy candied nuts. Second whiff a minute later has supple, ripe fruit like doughy cantaloupe and honeydew, peach and lychee all hinting at the yeast used. There is also a hint of Belgian pale candi, nutmeg and mace spice and a touch of oaken wood. Odd hint of camphor and eucalypt kick it off as different on first sip. Nice level of sweetness, candyish, upfront. A wheatlike, drying and gritty toasted malt mid-palate and finish where it seems to drop off without a trace. Medium light body and sprightly in carbonation, it has a good overall mouthfeel. Very nutty, earthy, yeasty and musty in the tail with a piercing vanillin note. As it warms the palate shifts towards the nutty praline with an ever building taste of pale wood and absorbing yeast undertones.

Au nez, de fines fleurs sucrées et des herbes amères rencontrent des effluves de fruits qui finissent tardivement par se dévoiler.  Lalcool finit par se faire sentir.  Au goût, une certaine douceur sucrée est touché par des fruits acidulés qui enrobent des houblons grimaçants accompagnés, dans leur justesse, par quelques saveurs boisées.  Lalcool perce, relève et réchauffe les saveurs.  En bouche, le liquide est moyennement rond.  Son effervescence faite de fines bulles est vivante.

Intense pepper and cloves yield to complex fruity malts - peaches, dried apricots, autumnal apples - and woody hops (dulled resin, citrus). Noticeably astringent although the mouthfeel is oily. Underneath theres mild dried peach/ cider sweetness with drying spicy bitterness. Alcohol seems well integrated until it catches in the throat at the end.

Initial light sweetness, a little spicy, yeasty, some citrus, and more hoppy-bitter and perfectly dry toward the end. Noticeable alcohol, but not distracting. Another one that upped my considerable esteem for Dupont.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
2043,"2007-07-28",3.2,"Bottle 33 cl. Labeled Bommelsbier. [Courtesy of Papsoe, another great tasting session] Light beige fizzy head that mostly diminished. Clear sparkling golden color. Fair display of lacework. Aroma of yeast, fruit, spice, citrus, caramel. 
 Editorial note: Phenolic  Phenols can come from either yeast fermentation or bacterial infection. The phenols from fermentation are usually acceptable but common only in German-style wheat beers (clove, vanilla, light smoke). Phenols from infection are nasty  medicine, paint thinner, Band-Aids, bleach. Very rarely, medicinal qualities are sought by the brewer (Orval and a handful of other specialty Belgian ales) but the other bacterial phenols are always a sign of an infection.
Medium to full bodied with a warming alcoholic texture and an average carbonation. Sweet malty base flavor with light notes of bitterness (Maybe from the Phenols) and acidic. Light sweet and warming finish. 27-07-07","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"

2043,"2006-12-03",3.3,"Corky, musty nose hides a hugely malty nose. For Dupont, thats a lot of sweetness, thick grainy malts along with dried pear, banana, peach and apricot nuances. Underneath it all, a fair dose of oxidation hides mushroomy, old honey and damp earth suggestions. Unexpressive hops can do nothing to save the cause. The carbonation also feels like it might have been heftier at one point, now being very smooth for Dupont. Good potential, but Id make sure to have something very very fresh the next time.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2043,"2006-11-22",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2010 In short: A splendid farmhouse Biere de Garde with a Saison character.  Kick-ass.
How: Bottle 750ml, consumed relatively fresh (almost 2 years before best-before date) 
The look: Cloudy dirty golden body topped by a medium off-white head.
In long: Nose is really farmhouse, somewhere between a french Biere de Garde and a Dupont Saison (Moinette Biologique).  Body could hardly be more satisfying, a ton of cereals, a whole lot of yeast, very chewy and fluffy.  The Dupont signature yeast is all over the place and the beer is as much a Saison as it is a Biere de Garde if not more.  A lot of cobweb.  A lot of floral hops that feels like a garden flowers petals mash.  More cobweb.  The juicy garden flower petals is followed by a nice dryness in the finish.  No alcohol presence at all.  Dupont, a name that inspire all the respect and admiration that a name like Bush does not.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2043,"2006-11-12",3.2,"Any first impressions?
-A veil of foam sits atop the cloudy orange-amber.
-Cork has seeped into the nose, and takes a while before its evaporates completely.
-Peach and apricot jam lead to honey sweetness, trickling onto dry earth.
-The fluffy, soft effervescence is fitting but the flavor profile is somewhat overwhelmed.

What if you dig deeper?
-Once the cork emanations have mostly disappeared, vague fruity yeast esters show, as does nascent oxidation.
-A dry finish heralds earthiness, and tired grassy hoppiness.
-There is a touch of wilderness within.
-Obviously, our bottle hasnt evolved too well, and the cork might have been the main culprit here. A shame really, since the beer underneath must have been really interesting without these problems.
