There I am, sitting at Russian River, with unlimited fonts of Pliny, Supplication, Row 2 etc. all at my disposal, and WHAM!!!! This unassuming little Blonde Ale comes out of left field and literally brings tears to my eyes. (Seriously, the waiter actually came up and asked if anything was wrong...)  I never thought I would ever have another 5, especially not this soon, but this beer just does it for me.

Draft at Russian River; Pours clear deep orange, with a thin and persistent white head, fabulous lacing. Nose is white peach, persimmon, nectarines... God but this is perfect... I can NEVER get this level of juicy stonefruit from my own IPAs at home, I had given up on trying! Flavours of stonefruit, with grapefruit, tropical fruit, and clean, delicate malt. The bitterness builds, nonexistent at the beginning, but fully there by the final sip. Spectacular. I think this might be the perfect beer for me, custom tailored to my palate. I had a Pliny and a Blind Pig after this, both beers I dearly love, and they couldnt touch this. Just a stunning effort.

Only a few were exceptional (jester king drinkin the sunbelt, Heady topper, Cantillon, and a few others),  This beer could be the perfect session beer along with jester king drinkin the sunbelt.  If these beers were bottled, i would buy them by the case!  This awesome beer poured very lite orange verging on yellow with a small soapy head and sparse lacing.  nose is floral berries lemons, white grapes-oh man, that is good! WOW!  flavors are huge floral white grape and lemon notes-somewhat like a mix of nelson saulvin and Sorachi Ace.  Crisp palate, huge flavors and such a small beer.  I only had 2 beers after the sampler was done, and this was one of them!  Just a lovely drinking little blonde ale here-dry finish just not that bitter.

Aroma is weedy hop, fresh from vine, green and ripe with some pink grapefruit. Juicy and refreshing palate. The hemp esters come through as do the juicy citrus flavors, clementine plus pith and zest. Nice easy drinking pale, like a good bitter.good malt backbone balances the bright hop, but makes for quite a lot of malt sugars residual that I can do without as with the earthy note in aftertaste too.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
2095,"2011-10-11",4.0,"A - Served a clear copper-orange color with a half-finger of frothy white head atop. The head fades down fairly quickly and leaves behind some nice lacing.

S - The aroma is a mix of citrus hops with some other fruity elements (mango) and a bit of spiciness as well. There is also some sweet caramel malts as well.

T - Starts off with a good kick of citrus hops with again some mango mixed in with some light bitterness and some sweet caramel malts. Through the middle, the mango and bitterness grow with the malt flavors getting a bit richer. The finish is a mix of sweet malts, hops, bitterness, and a bit of yeast that lingers.

M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It feels smooth with a nice dry sharpness to it.

D - Very drinkable. Really interesting and unique hop profile that is really nice from start to end. The mango flavor is defiantly different. Overall, I really like this beer.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

Pours a clear light peach color with a two-finger white head and plenty of spotty lacing on the way down. Half a cap and a nice collar throughout. The nose bursts forth with some really nice tropical aromas and a good dosing of citrus as well. Mango and a some orange predominate. Slightly floral as well. The taste combines the hop elements quite well, especially in the feel. Not too much malt taste, just a bit of breadiness that lends a very slight chewiness to the body. Good bitterness and carbonation. Really solid brew. Wouldnt expect anything less from Vinnie and crew.

2095,"2010-03-12",3.3,"Had this on tap at Russian River brewpub. Nice tight small head that isnt spotty in the least. Copper color with a slight haze. Looks pretty damn good for a Blond, but I was thinking this would be an IPA, given the name. Nice crisp and fresh hop aroma. Damn that is a hop aroma that I wouldnt have expected from a Golden/Blond ale. Slight citrus, yet almost leaning towards a pine hop aroma. A sweet aroma is coming through as well, and balances this brew out quite well. Has a lighter hop flavor than was expected. Malts are dominating here. Given the aroma I as expecting more of that citrus/pine hop flavor. Nice take on a Golden I must say; they tend to be boring and thing without much to speak of in the way of hops. A subtle fruit flavor mixes in with the malts and overshadowed hops. The citrus/pine hop flavor, and sweet almost fruity malt flavor work well together.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

2095,"2009-02-18",3.8,"On tap at the Falling Rock for the Russian River kickoff in Colorado, this was described as a hoppy blonde ale. It smelled like serious west coast hops. The flavor was also very hoppy but it didnt make me think pale ale or IPA, very strange style-wise. There was also a soapiness to the flavor but it wasnt a detractor as well as an earthy stink. Many folks around me described this as an IPA but I disagree. It almost seemed like a heavily hopped redemption but at the same time it didnt seem like a belgian-style. Weird but good as is the case with RR.

There are some interesting apricot or plum flavors to the beer that are not present in other RR beers. There was still the usual floral, pine, and citrus hop flavors from RR, but there was a bit more complexity on the sweet end of the spectrum. It could use a bit more balancing bitterness.
