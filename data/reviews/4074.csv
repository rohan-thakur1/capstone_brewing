4074,"2016-04-27",3.4,"Tapped straight from the foeder in a sample row of 4 young-to-old foederbier versions - oldest, 18m old version @source, Rondje Roodbruin 2016-IV. - Deep grape bordeaux red pour, flat. - Rougher, less funky and balsamico-forward version of the Brussels version, offering mostly dry and fruit-estery renditions of lactic acid and berry, all delivered at once in a bit of a woody-tannic attack on the palate. Great to taste how well and delicately this roughish base lambiek is blended with caramel-forward young ""ale"" to form the sweet&sour Vander Ghinste Oud Bruin.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

4074,"2014-08-02",3.5,"The raw lambic of which the Jacobins beers are made, not bottled nor otherwise commercialised, tasted at HOP Karakterbierweekend in Vichte in 2008. Off-white, very loose head, artificially created for serving purposes only and disappearing instantly. Bronze colour, aroma sour and estery, passion fruit, wine vinegar, medium dry sherry, lemon, brown sugar, sweetish onset in the mouth quickly drying up due to the sour basic taste, complex, yeasty, wood, long dry finish, smooth mouthfeel without carbonation. Quite different from the real lambics in the Brussels area but very interesting and complex.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4074,"2014-04-10",4.0,"3/IV/14 - straight from the oaken foeders @ Bockor foederzaal (Bellegem) during TV recordings for Vlaanderen Vakantieland - BB: n/a (2014-326) Thanks to Alex for the sample!
Note: got to try two different versions of the foederbeer, a 4 month old and a 12 month old. The 4 month old Im putting up as Jonge Lambik.
Clear orange beer, obviously without any head. More sour than the young version, fruity and lemony. MF: thinner texture than the young version, easier drinkable, with still a nice medium body to it. Taste: more sour, yet a very mellow sort of sourness. Also very fruity with notes of peaches. Aftertaste: very sour, some citric acidity, astringent. Very glad to have tried these beers straight from the foeders! Thanks a lot Vlaanderen Vakantieland for the free trip and Alex for the samples!","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
4074,"2014-04-06",3.5,"Tap at Backcountry. Pours still, clear yellow gold with no head or lacing. Looks similar to mead. Aroma is quite funky, barnyard, cheese, and big vinegar. Flavor is moderately tart, strong vinegar, acidic, with a tart, vinegar, mildly buttery oak aftertaste. Quite acidic and raw; unadulterated sour. Soft carbonation, medium body, with an astringent, mildly dry finish.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Brouwerij"
4074,"2012-05-07",2.7,"The beer is a very pale yellow color with minimal carbonation or head.  Really a fairly bland nose to this.  Some cereal sweetness, a hint of barnyard funk, and very minimal tartness or acidity.  A very light note of tropical fruit.  The flavor has a heavy mineral quality to it and tastes almost salty.  Kind of watery without much body or flavor to it.  Not a big fan.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

4074,"2012-04-02",4.0,"Draft on tap at Fountainhead (Chicago, IL). A true treat. Pours a rich straw bright hue, bright yellow with big haziness. A rich frothy bright white head sits atop and films, laces ok overall. A great hue in the body. Aromas are puckering on the nose, rich lemons and crab apples mix with lactic acid, touches of oak, bretty funk. Firm sourness hits the nostrils with gentle yogurt, grapefruit, and a faint waft of grass. Mellow sweetness moves into firm and strong lactic and sour qualities. Initial is medium bodied, giving some life to the palate with a crushing sourness, not acidic, but rich sour lemons and green apples, crab apples, and gentle bready and dry malts. Rich lactic sourness, sweet tarts, and touches of oranges. More apple, pears, and faint kiss of banana. Wow. Middle is still sour, not giving way to any sort of sweet maltiness, but kicking in strong sour fruits and a good coating palate, not thin or anything. Rich sour fruits, nothing harsh or acidic but healthy puckering presence. Wow. Backend is sour and dry, lingering healthy strong lactic presence. Lemons, touches of gentle yogurt, more lemons, and really just a great flavor explosion. The way I describe this would turn some people off.. But really its not harsh or acedic, its an explosion of sourness that somehow works well. Well done.. Could be a touch harsh for some, but on my palate, its enjoyed.. Yet still a slow go-er. It just appears Im a big Unblended lambic fan looking at my ratings..","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Quite bright, pale yellow colour, with a slight haze. Only the merest hint of bretty barnyard in the aroma. Its mainly the tart, sharp, acidic, slightly citric character that defines this beer. More tart and acidic than sour per se. It also had some gooseberry leaf / cats pee on the nose. Very clean mouthfeel.
