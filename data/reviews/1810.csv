1810,"2017-02-03",4.4,"On tap at McGillicuddys, Five Corners, Essex Junction, VT.
Though poured into a pint glass, I get whats going on, heres the rest.
The appearance was a pure black color with a thin bar pours kind of slim white head that falls immediately. Stringy sliding lacing.
The aroma blends a roasty sweet coffee to cocoa bean robust combination over subtle roasty vanilla beans. Just a tad of caramel, sly breadiness. Warming lager yeastiness. Touch of dry woody/barrel nose.
The flavor takes all of those previously mentioned aromas to blend and leave a sort of rugged burnt toasty taste to ride along. Sly blended coffee/vanilla/bready/roasty aftertaste rolling into the finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a great sipping quality about it. Moderate carbonation. Yeastiness seems to help control the ebb and flow of the roastiness hitting my tongue, so its fairly smooth.
Overall, damn nice variant of Framinghammer, well worthy of finding again. I need to find bottles of this.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1810,"2016-08-25",3.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting at Andrews house on August 18. 500 mL bottle. The pour is a medium to dark brown with a thin cream colored head that falls to a thin ring, no lace. This is a lot thinner than I would have ever suspected. The aroma is dark fruit up front, with a nice oak and a good booziness to it. The vanilla is light and one the back end. The vanilla picks up a little more in the flavor, but the roast, dark chocolate and dark fruits really dont let it stand out too crazily. The bourbon is big on the back end. The mouth feel is thin and light. There is a softer carbonation, but its watery. The aftertaste is lingeringly oaky and slightly tainted with vanilla. This is interesting, but definitely not as good as Id hoped.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

M- medium oily body like all Framinghammers. Alcohol is well hidden. 

T- vanilla beans are proud and prominent from the get go. Chocolate is dry and somewhat secondary but not to be outdone. Earth notes are strong in the middle. Oak and dried fruits show up fashionably late and welcomed. Some herbal and vegetal notes follow, like green pepper, grass and tarragon.

A - Pours jet black with a decent one finger tall tan head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small webs of lace down the sides of the glass. 


S - Smells of strong vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, oak, coconut, coffee and smoked dark malt. The vanilla is strong, but not as strong as the coffee version is, while still being well balanced. 


T - Starts off with plenty of sweetness from the vanilla and chocolate malt slowly being joined by the dark roast, day old coffee, toasted coconut, cream and warming woody bourbon. Finish is pretty roasty with some nice vanilla sweetness, lingering long after the finish.


M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, sweet feel with some mild roastiness to balance it out. A bit of booze creeps in as it warms up but it never gets in the way of the other flavors.


O - It is tough for me to choose between this one and the coffee, I give the slightest edge to the coffee because it integrates so well with the other flavors but this one is just as good. I would love to have this one again in the future.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
1810,"2014-07-10",3.8,"Bottle; I Had this one after the ""Regular"" Barrel Aged variant. I found the labeling confusing. Going into it, I expected this to be a vanilla bean version of the regular (non barrel aged) default beer. I guess Vanilla Barrel-Aged Framinghammer doesnt fit :) But I get it now. The nose is chocolate morsel, mild astringent, with a strong vanilla presence and light brown sugar. I found the additional sweet vanilla character to impact this bourbon barrel variant negatively. I say negatively light, but I found the regular barrel aged version to feel nearly perfect for the style. The additional vanilla over powers the nuances somewhat, but either way : Chocolate, light bittering hop presence, moves to velvet grain, light brown sugar, vanilla syrup , light smoke, and a very light barrel presence.

1810,"2014-05-17",3.0,"Whoa . This was hot, and not much notes of a baltic porter. I was not impressed, and this was supposed to be one of the best of the group. And satisfied my curiosity to try any more of these.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"
1810,"2014-05-17",3.8,"Bottle acquired via trade from ClarkVV. Thanks, dude! Pours a nice darker blackish brown hue, not opaque but dark enough. Brownish lighter glow on the edges shows a bit. Frothy tannish / light brown head hybrid meets with gentle stick around. Aromas are decent vanilla bean, touches of roast and mellow cocoa, faint coffee elements. Mellow oak grows a bit, subtle spirits, touches of caramel, biscuit and mellow brown sugar. The vanilla bean is present but not overwhelming or done to death. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a bit heavier. Touches of bitterness and roast meet some decent smoothed out vanilla, touches of cocoa flourish, some biscuit and mellow spirit cling. Middle shows a touch more body but still a bit thinner overall. Some smoothness, creamy vanilla hits as we start to taper out. Oak and barrel element seems well integrated, not hot. Perhaps the base just isnt that full to begin with as Im not getting any offensive or overdone barrel elements. Finish is dry, a bit tannic and flavorful, decent vanilla and gentle roast, touches of oak and cocoa, coffee elements hold together. Solid stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

The aroma has intense vapours of sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, chocolate covered raisin, roasted coffee, fig newtons, a touch of ashy, tobacco and leathery earthiness. The taste is moderately sweet and chocolaty with the vanilla kicking it towards the finish. Just a tad piney hops still running here and there along with light handed dark fruit notes (this is something I would have like to seen more of). Smooth, lush and oily mouth feel hiding most of the 10% ABV, most not all. Overall this is a nice treat as snow is falling two days after it was nearly 80 degrees.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1810,"2014-04-01",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
This silky Barrel-Aged Baltic Porter offers sultry vanilla notes over coffee-like roastiness and sweet chocolate in a rich mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam laces atop the ebony.
-The low carbonation tends to make the body feel bigger.
-Complexity may not be this beers strong suit, but it remains a smashing dessert brew.
-Bourbon and vanilla are obviously very harmonious.

solid black color with a smallish tightly bubbled tan head that quickly dissipates to wisps of foam on top. Aromas of chocolate chip cookie dough dominate with hints of brown sugar, earthy oak and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is sweet chocolate and vanilla frosting up front but the barrel wood and spirits come in quickly to squash that. The finish is a lingering brown sugar roasted grain and vanilla affair. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy silky syrupy mouthfeel. I love this beer! Complex clean and extremely flavorful.

Some coffee/chocolate bitterness in the flavor, along with some whiskey/bourbon alcohol.

A touch of roasted malts and oak. Taste is milk chocolate into a very sweet wall of vanilla. Its coating and thick and detracts from any other notes. Cant say I get any bourbon notes other then some alcohol heat and a light char on the finish. Smooth and creamy yet still thin enough to feel like a porter. Overall this was the worst of the variants for me. The vanilla, although tasting genuine, was just too much and too sweet despite the relative thinness of the base beer.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
1810,"2014-02-16",3.1,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2014 2014 bottle, drunk 2/16/14Dark mahogany with some lighter auburn tints. Great clarity, not opaque by any means. Light beige head is small and recedes fairly rapidly to cover, with moderate lacing.Coconut, alcohol, corn and light vanilla in the nose. Phew, they arent messin around with the bourbon barrel here. Stuff is pretty raw. Must be a very new barrel, first or second use at most. The booziness burns off quickly, at least and youre left with just a ton of bourbon. Maybe a touch of chocolate and lightly sweet maltiness in the background but no roastiness really breaks through the bourbon dominance. After some more warming and breathing, I do begin to get some light coffee notes and a touch of dark roast.In the mouth, Im actually surprised by how much less bourbon dominance there is. Dark chocolate and roastiness are forward with a very light vanilla sweetness and some more coconut, but none of the expected graininess or harshness from overdone barrel character. Alcohol is present and warming but not terribly overt. Soft, slick mouthfeel and a medium-light body. Nice balance of sweetness and roast. Tends sweeter with the vanilla exacerbating this a bit, but by no means is the vanilla overdone. Retronasal hoppiness is lightly piney and only moderately bitter. Carbonation is light, but not too light; does help break up the sweetness a bit. Overall, the aroma is too much like a whiff of chocolate bourbon and theres too much alcohol warmth on the finish. Yes, as a sipper, its certainly tolerable and enjoyable, but to me its just too many forceful flavors competing with too light of a body. Dont see why this couldnt be in the 7% abv range and be every bit as flavorful.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
