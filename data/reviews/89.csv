89,"2013-08-20",4.4,"Reviewed 9-2-10.

Ive heard a lot of good buzz about this one from many of my beer friends. Some say its even better than Schlaflys, so... Im doing a comparison tasting and drinking a Schlafly at the same time. Here goes:

Ap: Pours pretty thick, with a slight bubbly head that quickly withers away to nothing, and a beautiful dark dark orange-red (almost bronze) color. The carbonation is moderate.

Ar: Deep smell of pumpkin. And I mean HUGE! All the standard spices are there (nutmeg, brown sugar, etc.), but the smell of the actually gourd is prominent.

T: Much sweeter than Schlafly and not as much pumpkin ""roast"" overall. I really love the crispness. The spices are a little more muted than the Schlafly, and the sweetness is a bit more ""tart.""

P: Really good. Nothing offensive about the sugar content. It feels exactly the way it should for this style.

O: Since I love pumpkin ales and the harvest time of year in general, Ill drink this again. Definitely in the top 5 pumpkin ales available!

UPDATED REVIEW! The 2011 version is much better than Schlaflys (the local phenomenon). Its richer, creamier, and more pumpkin-like. 

Honestly, I couldnt imagine a better pumpkin ale.","Washington DC, USA","Chaneybr"

The beer appears orange to brown hued. A fine color for an autumn beer. The aroma brings pumpkin right up front, followed by cinnamon, nutmeg, pie, vanilla, malt. The flavor is great, with flavors of pumpkin pie, vanilla, and Fall spices. A bit sweet, but not too. Certainly one of the better pumpkin ales I have had.

I was apprehensive about the taste, knowing that raw pumpkin isnt something I have fond memories of, but thankfully the wonderful spice notes of ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg are the dominant feature.

89,"2011-02-18",3.9,"Poured hard into a tulip glass. Bottle split with Amyliz4, the resident expert of all things pumpkin. Very slight, quarter-finger head that quickly recedes. The beer itself is a dark shade of copper amber with a bit of orange. No visible carbonation bubbles. After a tough swirl, surprisingly theres a pretty good deal of spotty lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. A tiny layer of foam remains.

Initial whiff brings quite a bit of sweetened caramel malt and a bit of cider, though not in a bad way. The whole things combines with spices and reminds me a bit of Apple Jacks. This follows through in the taste, which isnt as sweet and caramelized as the nose would suggest. Mild pumpkin flavors come through, like a very delicate pumpkin mousse.

This is almost like a modification on a brown or amber ale, in that it focuses on some mildly sweet malt. This brings a decent amount of pumpkin flavor, but isnt very heavy at all on the spicing. Its much different than most pumpkin beers, but definitely has quite a bit of a Fall vibe.

Mouthfeel is fairly light with low levels of carbonation. Somewhat sweet and nowhere near cloying. The near lack of spice is much better than being overly spiced. Somewhat dry in the finish. This drinks really well overall. This is a nice and easy drinking beer, a pretty good Fall beer.

Also, wow. Just now seeing that this is an 8% abv beer. I had no idea and had assumed it was near 5%. Ill have to bump the feel up a bit. Ill leave drinkability as is, but this is way too drinkable considering how high in alcohol it is. I was just about to comment that this could be a sessionable ale on cold nights. Overall, quite good, and certainly a bit different than the average pumpkin beer.

B+ from the wife. Not as good as Pumking or Schlaflys version.

The beer pours an orangish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a nice mix of pumpkin, along with all of the spices you expect in a pumpkin pie. The flavor is more of the same.

The cloudy amber beer at first looks like a dunkelweizen complete with a nose big on cloves, nutmeg, and weizen yeast not unlike banana bread. The head is not as rambunctious as a hefeweizen and really doesnt want to lace nor billow out. However, the beige/yellow head has very good retention and protects the beer indefinitely. The nose opens up to pumpkin pie, maraschino cherries, sweet tea, cinnamon, slight candied yams. Taste is creamy pumpkin with lots of sugar at first then moves to quite a bubbly, astringent, bitter graininess that has more alcohol than pumpkin spices.

89,"2009-11-17",2.9,"Bottle. Pours a deep, dark auburn color, slightly hazy, crowned by a small, tight head of khaki colored foam. The head settles quickly to a thin rim, leaving nearly no lacing behind. Predictably, the nose is heavily spiced and loaded with pumpkin. Notes of clove, cardamom, nutmeg, and celery salt lending a winter time feel to the underlying, rich caramel malt. The pumpkin note is fairly fresh and authentic. The flavor is laden with spices, celery salt asserting itself far too much for my taste, teaming with the peppery nutmeg to dominate the toasted pumpkin. Accordingly, the long and spicy aftertaste isnt too pleasant. The palate is substantial and creamy, initially balanced, but finishing on the overly sweet, sticky side. Though I can see how fans of the style would fall in love with this, it represents alot of what I dont enjoy about pumpkin beers (mainly aggressive spicing).

Spices stand up fairly potent, as smoother sweet malts of caramel, toffee, vanilla fill in behind. Initial is medium bodied, preaching cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, vanilla, and caramel, as the actual pumpkin does fall a bit behind. Creamy sweetness mixed with potent spices, a smooth caramel, vanilla, and pie crust, with pumpkin and spice. Very light bitterness on the back of the palate, lingering spice and sweetness.

89,"2009-10-04",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2009 TOP OF THE HEAP! This is my flat out favorite pumpkin this season. You KNOW that this is the real deal when you smell it. This beer is made with roasted cut pumpkin, not pumpkin flavor, not pumpkin extract, but the REAL stuff. The pour is a bright autumn orange with a creamy dense head that maintains a consistent thickness all the way down. The aroma is of mild spices, and big sweet carmelized gourd. The flavor is big on bready toasty malts, hints of caramel, and the slightly burnt sugars of the roasted pumpkin. The spices are there, but no where near the intensity of some other brews that try to mimic a Thanksgiving pie. They compliment the sweetness of the fruit and malt by adding a special earthy nature in conjunction with the hops. The potency of the flavors in this ale, along with its dense mouthfeel make a perfect dessert beer in my book. I only hope I can find more of it!","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Davetopay"

More toasted notes this year, vanilla, pumpkin, perfect level of spice. Seriously, theyve hit a home run with this beer this year. Old score was 8/3/9/4/17. Taste is going up, as is palate, as is overall. This is now a top 10 beer for me.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
89,"2009-09-18",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 18, 2009 1st rating for this brew! 12oz bottle from grape & gourmet, batch 91009. pours a very nice clear, dark copper with a whispy, off white head and a solid ring of lace. aroma is great and very similar to pumpkin cheescake with big, sweet pumpkin notes, graham cracker crust, and pure spice notes of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, with a touch of caramel malts. flavor is excellent as well with natural pumpkin flavors blended with sweet vanilla, big spice notes of cinnamon and nutmeg, orange peel and clove, and a touch of nutty, carrot cake with a lingering, spiced finish. palate is medium bodied and very well carbonated with a great balance of sweetness and fall spice. overall, another great new brew from Geoff and AleWerks!","Norfolk, Virginia, USA","ksurkin"
