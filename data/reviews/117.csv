Appearance: Deep golden amber with pinkish reflects and nice legs. 

Aroma: Mild. Tart apples, brown sugar notes, floral notes and oak.

Palate: Medium body. A bit liquorous. Nice sharp acidic finish with lingering tart apples and light warming.

Overall: Not the most expressive aroma, but its one of the best tasting Ice Ciders I have tried so far. The acidity is really really interesting and help the drinkability. I could have drank the full bottle (or at least half of it) by myself easily. Superb!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Smell is tart & sweaty, peppery & alcoholic. Potent apple & pear fumes rise up along those of saturated oak & bittersweet apple skins. So intense you want to suckle it.


Taste is overshadowed by the amazing smell, though still quite wonderful. Tart & leafy. A lemon-honey apple sauce if there were such a thing. Not big or complex.


The body is middle of the road, & the alcohol is a little too small to really carry the necessary flavors. It does manage a bittersweet finish, though it stops abruptly in its tracts too soon to be called lingering.

You may or may not notice yourself melting into your seat breathing in the leftover residuals clinging to your glass. That is worth a few extra points in the ""overall"" category to me.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"

117,"2008-10-09",4.0,"Pours a lovely orange red with some extremely fine carbonation that lines the bottom of the glass. This is not a carbonated cider, though, nor does it taste it. The strength of this cider is no doubt in its absolutely wonderful tartness: that aspect of the flavor is so dead on that it is hard not to love this drink. However, there is not too much else going on. There is a lack of complexity, and a lack of oomph, and the finish is actually quite short and doesn’t leave a never-ending sweetness on the tongue like some of the best ice ciders. It’s almost wheaty in the finish, and it is a bit watery as well. However, the tart in this from the Geneva apples is simply so wonderful that I can’t give this any lower than a 4.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Since this was my first Ice cider I wasnt exactly sure what to expect, but it was great.  Flavor was full of sweet and sour apples, one of my favorite flavors in general, and the cider didnt disappoint.  The finish was very dry and prickly and even more tart.  I definitely need to take a trip to Quebec to get more of this, and I may even have to give Geneva apples a try.  This is certainly the ""Michael Jordan"" of ciders, as far as I can tell.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","jessbnjess"

Aroma of caramel apples along with a fair bit of tartness as well.  Taste is beautiful: starts off very sweet, but then dries up in a flash.  Dryness melds into sourness, leaving the tongue feeling a bit prickly.  When on the tongue, this cider feels almost weightless, like its just sort of floating there.  Havent experienced that before.  Finishes bone dry and sour.  It practically sucks all the moisture out of my mouth;  it even makes my tongue stick out!  This is some kind of good, let me tell you.  I must get another bottle.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
