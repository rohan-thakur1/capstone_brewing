1830,"2016-07-22",3.9,"341ml bottle. Gift from ""northropfrye"". Thanks, Andrew!. Pours an intense near black color with a very thick, pillowy and creamy light brown head that diminishes slowly. Aroma is moderately roasty but with a good mixture of melanoidins including some molasses, cake and even a tad of caramel. Chocolate and cocoa predominate anyway, giving way to a hint of wood and toffee. Taste is wonderful with non-intense sweetness and a good roasty finish, some chocolate-bitterness. Slight caramel and woody touches. Extremely well balanced. It feels silky smooth, thick in the mouth. Really palate-caressing. A small warming effect but alcohol pretty much unnoticeable. Highly drinkable. My first Baltic Porter is an excellent one.","Hanga Roa, Easter Island, CHILE","Panzerfaust"

Nice solid porter - full body supporting nice roasted malt notes of cocoa and espresso, with just a little herbal hop bitterness and some faint woody complexity. Porters arent typically my favourites, but this is a pretty well-balanced performer. (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Le nez est plein de chocolat et de toffee avec une touche boisée et des fruits qui sont à la fois agréables et à la fois bizarrement acidulés.  La bouche rappelle les grandes lagers noires avec des saveurs confortablement chocolatées, caramélisées et rôties.  Les esters fruités sont ici pour le meilleur et pour le pire : quelque chose de bon et quelque chose qui cloche.  La sensation sur le palais est bien intéressante : le liquide est dense, leffervescence en accord avec le style et la texture très douce.  La finale permet à un alcool jusquici bien dissimulé de réchauffer les notes chocolatées qui saccrochent derrière la langue.

1830,"2011-07-24",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2011 Description: Baltic Porter à presque 8 degrés fermentée avec des levures de lager. 
Comment: Bouteille de 341ml avec cire blanche partagée avec Patrick. 
Visuel: Le liquide est brun, la mousse est beige et très épaisse. 
Olfactif: Le nez de pomme verte détonne, il y a aussi une bonne dose de chocolat et de grille, mais les pommes dominent. Il y a des odeurs rappelant le Sake.
Gustatif: Elle est ronde, elle mousse en bouche, les saveurs de chocolat sont bien agréables. La fin de bouche est à la fois piquante et agréable.

Smooth nearing medium strength chocolate, roasted stuff, sweet fruit (Nectarine maybe?), dull molasses, soft wood (yea, would have not recognized this if I didnt know to look for it), something reminding me of maraschino cherries. I like the aroma but I wish that I didnt have to fight recognize it so much. Drinks really really good! Just a hint of the alc but at the same time theres some bakers chocolate bitterness that keeps everything cool.   Coffee that is actually tasty, figs, smoke, shit load of roast.

Full body with some good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done for the style and not too extreme  I could drink more then one in a session.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
1830,"2008-06-01",3.6,"341ml bottle courtesy of Tommy84. Pours amost black and nearly opaque with a 3/8-inch head. Aroma is subtle but good, alluding to malt and a little brown sugar. Flavor is malty, with a good espresso backdrop. Slightly sweet. Not outstanding, but theres nothing to be found wrong with this porter. Satisfying, recommended. Would try again if I had the chance. Thanks Half Pints.","California, USA","Gypsy19"
1830,"2008-05-05",3.2,"Bottle (341ml).  Courtesy of Oakbluff - of course!.  Very deep (but not hazy) ruby pour, average-to-small light brown fizzy head.  Roast sweet coffee malt, alcohol and leafy herbal hops are my aroma impression - no a grabber, but pleasant (7-).  The taste has that alcohol/sweet roast coffee/syrup thing you expect, but its a bit light - the alcohol really comes to the fore quickly - decent grassy/herbal bittering keeps it from being too sweet, but Id prefer more malt body to keep the hotness in check.  So light and alcoholic are palate primaries, but also some light squeakiness - as it warms I get a surprising amount of lightly funky herbal hops.  Tone the ABV down and its a solid slightly dry porter;  boost the malt and body and then youve got a solid baltic.  Not bad though ...","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
1830,"2008-04-20",2.9,"Pours a dark chocolate colour.  Thick Creamy Head.  Smells of coffee and malt, with a hint of vanilla.  Tastes similar - a little too harsh for my liking.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","bweezy"
1830,"2008-04-19",3.4,"341ml bottle. Very roasty aroma. Bitter chocolate, charred wood, bitter coffee grounds and some toasted vanilla bean. Pours as a porter should. Nearly opaque brown with a dense light brown head. Creamy texture. Not nearly as astringent on the tongue as the nose would lead me to believe. Still fairly heavy on the bitter and tarry malt, though. Some vanilla and molasses pokes through. Almost meaty... venison, perhaps? Leaning toward full bodied with a lasting, tarry finish. Thanks Scott!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

O - I love this brewery, but this was not my favorite","Cambridge (via Winnipeg), Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","thepegjett"
1830,"2008-04-14",3.9,"Near black in colour with moderate carbonation. Aromas of chocolate fudge, mild roasted coffee, and a bit of vanilla caramel. More chocolate baking in the mouth, along with caramel malts upfront. The cold coffee notes come through stronger on the back end, along with some very mild grainy wood and a bit of spicy hop. Thick milkshake-like body. Definitely less fruity than some other baltics Ive had, I think this one would qualify under a ""strong porter"" category if one existed. Nice to see that the oak treatment isnt over the top (not that I expected it to be). Very nice.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1830,"2008-04-02",4.2,"341ml bottle. *sigh*
Deep deep brown beer with a medium sized toffee coloured head. Light fluffy body. Smooth texture. Aroma is sweet with light chocolate and a bit heavier coffee notes as well as some of that crystal coming through.  Finishes nicely dry and bitter. Good stuff.","winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","dkazuk"
1830,"2008-03-20",3.1,"The Aroma is malty with hints of oak. Its appearance is as dark as asphalt, very suitable for the name.  This Porter is very flavorful light chocolaty taste overall maltiness and yes there are notes of oak.  I found the pothole porter fairly delightful however when I tried it it was not yet fully carbonated, it will definitly be better when it is.  Im looking forward to its release however most of my friends would likely cringe to its tar like darkness.  


Oh well, That means more for me :)","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","TheHumanKeg"
