4500,"2017-05-27",3.4,"Huge thanks to WillemsUrenkel for that one! Bottle looks interesting. Beer in the glass zippy, nice head. Starts intense malty-yeasty, light alcoholic hints, but the high ABV is well hidden. Fruity notes of apricot, some banana. Modest sweet. Finish strong, bit more alcoholic.
