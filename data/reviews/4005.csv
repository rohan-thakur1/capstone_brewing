4005,"2017-05-03",4.4,"Given to me to sample by a very good beer friend from his cellar. It came in a 12 oz. bottle with some nifty artwork on the label. The pour yields a stout-like dark, almost jet black, body along with a foamy beige top that leaves a good accounting of the sips I take. The nose is unexpected for an IPA, earthy, malty and some spice. A drink gives an interesting combination of malt and resin, biscuit and a vanilla-chocolate finish. A touch of bitterness lingers. Quite involved, very appealing. A great Black IPA, better than most Imperial IPAs. A great day indeed. Oh, and the bottle says 10.6% abv. Strong in many ways.","Midland, Texas, USA","KevinReddirt"

Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Black DIPA style.

Maybe its just the high abv throwing me off here (9.5%). The palate is heavy, and a bit sticky.

4005,"2014-11-11",4.7,"Odell is one of my longtime favorite breweries and the Black IPA style is quickly becoming one of my most sought-after styles. So its no great surprise to find that I really liked this beer. A lot. Let me start off by saying that the bottle art is insanely cool. Yes, I love most of Odells art, but this design deserves special recognition. The appearance of this brew is a work of art in its own right. This ale has a definitive shade of black that reveals some brown and mahogany color when held up to light. Head is a gorgeous toasted marshmallow color with a clean look and smooth surface. The aroma reveals fresh roasted coffee sensations and some sweet booze from the 9.5% ABV. Flavor is exceptionally balanced. The coffee and hop dynamics are almost at a perfect equilibrium. Palate is flawless. Its sleek going down and leaves behind a boozy bitterness that gets caked onto everything. While Mountain Standard doesnt dethrone Stones Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale as my favorite Black IPA, its quite possibly the smoothest Black IPA Ive had. Its the most beautiful by far.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Let me acknowledge that Denver is amazing because the arena that hosts three major league teams has this beer among many other local crafts available. This was supposed to be a 12 oz pour, but the bartender didnt get the memo. We got a nice deep, dark pour with a frothy tan head. Aroma is crystal clean with roasty, chocolatey malts, even some coffee hints; all highlighted by pine and grapefruit. The palate is thick and full, conveying the malty goodness perfectly. Hops cut through like a knife with straightforward PNW goodness. Its basic grapefruit/pine but so good. Finish is roasty, chocolatey, then bitter hops come out.

Flavor is decently hoppy but again not on the level of Stone 15th. The roast flavor really conflicted with the citrus, like oranges dunked in bitter coffee. I would have preferred chocolate covered oranges but oh well. Still, this is a decent beer and a much better value than when it was in 750s.

4005,"2012-11-15",3.8,"Draft and bottle sample. Very dark brown in colour with medium carbonation. Strong aromatic mix of pine sap, white grapefruit, roast, and coffee. Strong flavors of citrus, black pepper, and more pine sap blend well with notes of toffee, and dark chocolate. Fairly weighty on the palate, but the strong leafy bitterness balances things out nicely. It seems like just about every aspect of this beer is intense, aside from the apparent alcohol (which it hides well).

4005,"2012-09-24",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2012 March 28th, 2010 - Sometimes there is beer. And sometimes this is tragedy. This is a story with both. The ODell Mountain Standard Ale is a much needed integration of Colorado ingredients, showing off the best of our state, and snubbing those world class hops and agriculture producers out closer to the West Coast. My sample poured with a thick, cream colored head and a dark, muddy brown body. A clean smell of wet stone, caramel and bread dominates the aroma, though not without a hint of the hops to come. The flavor is mostly savory - biscuits, bread, a touch of caramel, but a surprisingly mild hop dimension. Now, here comes the tragedy. I spilled the sample. Well, maybe not me, but somebody spilled the sample. Whatever happened, the beer was forcibly ejected from the glass and sent off onto greener pastures (or grayer sidewalks). This is a shame for so many reasons, least of which was this tasted like a good beer. Luckily, with the power of hindsight I know Ill have another chance to drink it, but at least now I have my first impressions recorded.

Updated notes from July 18th, 2011 - Huge, pillowy head, forms geological abstractions, with a nice coffee/expresso brown colored head, The body Black with halos of cola brown. Star anise is prevalent in nose, with a puff of pepper, a lot of fig for the body, red wine oakiness.

Flavor, a surprisingly light body, springy, foamy, that oaky sharpness returns with generous alcohol,but hops have been pushed to the background. Noble hop. Aftertaste is long and whinnying aftertaste with a bit of raisin sweetness. But the palate doesnt linger at all. Interesting.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

From a recent trade courtesy patFC320

Appearance: This offering from Odell poured a dark brown/black with a 1 finger size frothy light brown head. Nice reddish hue on edges when held up to the light. Nice lacing evident. 

Smell: Surprisingly this is a very complex smelling beer with the hops standing out first. There is the floral and piney hops and the citrus hops present all at the same time. Then the dark malts come through with some bitter chocolate and toasted qualities. This is a very complex smelling beer. 

Taste: Wow not what I was expecting. There are some nice hops present but also the malts to counter those hops. Just a wonderful balance of fruity hops and malt to prevent this from being too bitter. Perfect balance represented here between the two as the hops also prevent this from being too sweet. The alcohol is non existent in the mouth. 

Mouthfeel: Nice creaminess with a slight thickness at first but then almost thinning out on the swallow when the hops shine with the aftertaste. 

Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed this double black IPA because I found it to be perfectly balanced without one aspect overpowering. It is too bad Odell does not distribute to my state because this is one Id seek out on a regular basis.","Illinois, USA","Sleuthdogg"

Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.

Surprisingly sour and it has a strange oily/slick/coating mouthfeel...very unpleasant to drink.  On top of that, the aroma is really simple and not enticing.  Very disjointed and aimless, kind of like the dump-bucket beer at an IPA-and-stout tasting.  Weird.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Quite full mouthfeel, somewhat dry, long finish. Overall, a fairly nice beer with good aroma...the taste Im less crazy about.

4005,"2011-06-28",3.1,"In short: A brutal and fruity Black IPA.  Meh.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed 4 months after it was bottled.  Bottle sent to me by tytoanderso, thanks a lot Tyler
The look: Near black body with ruby highlights topped by a medium beige head with low retention
In long: Strong nose is a mix of fruity hops, milk chocolate, fresh prunes and a some black liquorice candy.  Taste blends raisins dipped in caramel, fresh prunes, milk chocolate, soft liquorice candy, toffee, fruit cake, alcohol bite.  Bitterness level is high and it is also very resinous, and when added to the alcohol burn in the finish it makes for a slow sipper.  For what I like in a Black IPA this one was a little too lactic, too much fruitiness and not enough roastiness, excessive alcohol presence, too sticky.  This is a style I usually rate highly but this top-rated Black IPA didnt do it for me.  I drank the full 750ml by myself even if I didnt like it all that much, I dont want to brag but Im getting very good at drinking disappointing 750ml bottles by myself and being extremely lonely.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The body is creamy, medium-full with soft carbonation.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","punkrkr27"

4005,"2010-12-19",3.6,"This black IPA is solid, but a little disappointing.  i was expecting the hops to be much more prominent in both the aroma and taste, but the dark malt is the dominant part of this ale.  Perhaps there is a good reason that Colorado hops are not a common ingredient in most beers . . . but I did enjoy the taste despite my expectations.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AlexK"
4005,"2010-12-19",4.0,"Bottle pours black with a khaki head.  Aroma is a wonderful mixture of roasted malt and fresh candied hops.  Flavor performs just as admirably.  Overall body is moderate and the bitterness is well balanced.  Bravo!","Portland, Oregon, USA","dionysus"
4005,"2010-12-12",4.4,"Pours a dark red/brown with light brown head. Smells very hoppy and roasty. Has an amazing combination of warm roasty flavors and complex hop aromas. The flavors combine well enough to balance out. Theres not much as far as coffee aromas go (which I like). Ends with a subtle yet distinct war roasty flavor.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Nikiel"
4005,"2010-12-11",4.2,"Bottle. Pour is brown black with a tan head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is floral pine and roasted scents. Taste is great with nice bitter hops which come off piny and roasted malt and earthy flavors. Palate is medium feel with a somewhat creamy texture and finishes chaulky. This is solid and like it as much if not more than Southern Tiers Iniquity.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
4005,"2010-12-10",4.3,"Corked bottle and served in a Duvel snifter, mucho thanks Dave (dcschiller) for the bottle. Basically opaque cept for a amber highlight towards the bottom of the snifter, creamy fading head, outstanding lacework upon the glassware. Plenty of herbal, resiny, piney, and dank hops on the nose, Hopalicious! Also more than a full force of dark charred, sweet chocolate, and roasty toasted malts too. Peppery and clove esters, leather, tar, tobacco, minerals, and dirt, yea dirt works here.  I am sure there is no way the flavor profile could match that nose... well damn it anyway, it not only matched the aroma it beat it! Crisp and dank resiny hops kick your face in and then the smooth beat of the malts caress you into wanting more hop abuse. Boozy, yep. Astringent yep. Take no prisoners, yep. Not for the weak minded, yep. I completely dig this brash, aggressive, beer. A tour de force of charred malt  and dank resiny PNW hops. Okay, I just raved about Terrapin Captn Krunkles... well this rocks it out even more, now my #2 Black Ipa. Shiz., I am shocked by Odell honestly. I would have never guessed they had this brew in them. Well I am happy they did!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
4005,"2010-12-09",4.2,"750 ml bottle from Tournament.  Black pour, luscious creamy tan head.  Fresh, piny hops aroma.  Nice prickly carbonation mouthfeel,   Flavor is a combo of roasted malt and more fresh, resinous, piny hops.  Awesome beer.","New Hope, Minnesota, USA","13mikey"
4005,"2010-12-08",3.8,"750 ml bottle from Total Wine - Pours a brown color with a large light tan head.  Aroma is floral, pine, and citrus hops with a touch of roasted malt trying to stick its head in there.  flavor is big pine hops and roasted malt.  The hops really linger in the finish.  Medium body.  Drink this one sooner than later.  A good beer.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
4005,"2010-12-05",3.8,"Dark brown translucent and cloudy,  Medium to thick head.  Nose is mild hop resin and oak.  Very balanced with great toasted malt flavours and sweetness against the hop back.  Alcohol clocks 9.5% but is fully integrated.  Mouthwatering acid and largely back palate.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
4005,"2010-12-04",4.1,"Hazy dark brown. Lots of head. Nice sweet caramel malt backbone. Hoppiness is strong without a ton of bittering on the palate.  Really enjoyable brew.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","RyanMM"
4005,"2010-12-02",4.4,"750ml bottle corked and caged poured onto a Tulip at 41°.  Color is black, a hint of maroon showing when held up to a light.  Carbonation is good producing a big tan head.  Aroma is big on the hops with a back note of roasted malt.  The bold medium body has a smooth mouth feel with a slight fizziness.  Flavor jumps out with a deep roasted taste of coffee and chocolate then a bit of floral hops comes in followed by a mellow bitterness.  In the after taste the hops turn from floral to a very light citrus and the bitterness comes up giving it a slightly dry feel.  This brew rocks, it may be the best Black IPA I have had so far.  Its amazingly complex and rich yet very drinkable.  Its only down fall is the $13.50 price tag, if it was a little less I would drink it everyday.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"
4005,"2010-12-01",3.8,"Interesting.  Black body with a huge off white head, which literally took over 3 minutes to settle down.  Very unique and interesting aroma with hops, vanilla, and other hard to describe notes.  The hops are a bit muted for my tastes, but I think this is a good beer.  It definitely doesnt taste like any beer (including black IPA) that Ive tried up to this point.  A bit of a floral hop flavor, soapy texture.  Slightly odd but not bad.  Aroma beats the flavor.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
4005,"2010-11-30",3.6,"Poured at the Beer blogger conference for the speed blogging
Great aroma dark malts floral hops.  Flavor was rich with roasty malt and hops with fruit and floral character.  This had a wonderful finish a great Dark IPA for me.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
4005,"2010-11-30",3.8,"Bottle Very dark brown/black pour, lots of carbonation and a roasted malt and orange aroma.

4005,"2010-11-28",4.0,"Awesome! Grapfruit peel, citrus notes, floral hops, roasted malt, light cocoa! Flavor is hoppy and roasty.  Grapefuit peel up front, roasted malt, light coffee, good malt bill.  Nice.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
4005,"2010-11-28",3.8,"Appearance:  Pours a midnight black with a large fluffy head, that subsides to about 1/8 inch of creamy beige foam.

Aroma: Big herbal hops, medium roast, sassafras.

Taste: Chocolate malt,big herbal hops. roast, big abrasive bittering hops.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with lively carbonation.

Overall:  A unique roasty black ale. This came across as more like a big porter or stout as opposed to a double IPA with color.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
4005,"2010-11-27",3.7,"750 ml bottle from Randalls.  Pours a very dark brown color with a big, sticky tan head.  Aroma of piney hops, grapefruit citrus, peppery spices, roasted malts, toasted sugar, and cream.  Flavor is essentially the same, with a nice balance of earthy hops and roasted malts.  Medium-bodied, with a roasty mouthfeel and medium to high carbonation.  Good black IPA, tried back-to-back with the Grand Teton Trout hop and rated the same.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4005,"2010-11-23",3.9,"750. Not what I expected from a black IPA. Big grapefruit taste and aroma. That alcohol aroma as well is tempered by some creamy stout like taste. Some of that roasted malt coming through. Very nice and tasty. Better than any black IPA Ive had.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
4005,"2010-11-23",3.9,"bottled--once i got the cork out it poured dark brown with tight lasting head. aromas of toast, pine and citrus rind. flavors are similar. it is moderately bitter with hop presence. medium bodied black ipa with a lingering sense of hops and burnt malt. pretty decent beer.","Kansas, USA","beerdad"
4005,"2010-11-20",4.0,"Bottle. Pours black with thin lasting tan head. Great aroma of fresh citrus hops and resenous pine.  Medium body with healthy pine and underlying burnt malts.  Well balanced. Enjoyable brew","Littleton, Colorado, USA","waolsen"
4005,"2010-11-20",3.6,"Tap - a fairly creamy and smooth body for this style and strength - loads of green, oily, fresh hop flavor and aroma - a lot of black ipas fail to balance this with the chewy malt, but this does a fairly good job of it - the malt adds just enough of a sweetness to balance the hops and then gets the hell out of the way - slight roast on the back end that actually works well with the greenness of the hops - tasty.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4005,"2010-11-16",4.0,"750ml bottle.  Wow are Odell corks tight!  Pours dark brown/black with a monstrous creamy light brown head that retains well and laces the glass.

The aroma is roasted malts, some black licorice, and resiny piney tarry hops.

The flavor is roasted malts with a little sweetness and a good amount of fruity, medium bitter, hops in the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.

Overall, a very solid, well balanced, brew.  Nothing over the top, but very drinkable.  The alcohol is well hidden but the warming sneaks up on you.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
4005,"2010-11-16",4.1,"Pours inky brown, completely black and opaque in the glass, with a big tan head, very fine clinging lacing.  Aromas of pine, grapefruit, toffee, coffee,
 and toast.  Medium-full body, zesty and dry.  Mild sweetness, then a tiny bit crisp, medium-strong bitter finish.  A big, complex brew.  Excellent.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","scoth"
4005,"2010-11-14",3.2,"750 ml. bottle. Pours a fluffy beige head, with some lacing, over a clear brown (SRM 30) body.....nose is pine and citrus to start, then a bit of chocolate with a light sour tinge......taste is light sweet to start with a bit of toffee/caramel, then heavy pine resin and grapefruit with light cocoa/chocolate tones, in the finish there is a lingering amalgam of cocoa, pine and citrus.....mouth feel is on the light side of medium, alcohol well hidden carbonation high. This seems unbalanced, with the malt back bone needing more representation in the aromas and flavors. It lacks some of the richness as well as malty sweetness a double most often has. The hops used were Chinook and Cascade. BJCP 6/3/13/4/6","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"
4005,"2010-11-08",3.9,"2010 bottle.  Wow, they grapefruity hops stand out immediately!  The pour is an opaque, dark brown color with a full, dark beige, rocky, pillowy head which is somewhat lasting but leaves scattered lace all over.  The nose is full of juicy citrus hops with pink grapefruit, light resinous pine, a bit mineral, danky floral, faint dark breads, and only hints at some roast.  The flavor is still hoppy but gains a bit of dark malt sweetness and roast; still plenty of pink grapefruit and danky floral tones, lightly resinous, hints of smoke, some dark coffee roast, dark bread toast, and just a bit of dark chocolate in the more than medium bitterness.  The palate is medium to full, soft to lively, velvety, and creamy.  The finish is still full of the grapefruit notes, smoky dark chocolate, mineral notes, and the floral notes left on the tongue.  I had a beer from SKA made with hops from the Western slope of CO just like this one and got the same off-note; it is almost like a dirty smell/taste.  Granted this beer was put together much better than the SKA brew, but that off-note took away from what could have been a very nice BIPA.  Still, as is the beer is good and certainly deceptive but nothing compared to last years version.  I think I am just accustomed to my American hops coming from the Northwest.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"
4005,"2010-11-08",3.2,"Good solid amount of citrusy hops here. Love the sustainable angle too. Roasty notes are there but play a nice background note. My first taste of Odells and I like it.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
