1705,"2014-04-26",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2014 500 ml, weiss glass (drinking it right now). UNtypical weisse I would say. Pours medium/large head which dissolves quite rapidly, with an almost amber, dark orange color. Beautiful aroma, quite original for an hefe of its category, smells apples (rather than banana), which gives a more sour than sweet taste. Leaves a sort soury strudel biscuity palate. 
If I was tasting this blindfolded, I would say it tastes more dunkel than weizen, also due to the different color, amber / brownish.The missing link between hefe and dunkel.

1705,"2014-04-25",3.6,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a semi-dark brown body with a two finger foamy lumpy head that quickly dies to a film of a head, some light clingy lacing.
The smell had the ""banana""/estery yeast up front with some light wheat, and grass, comes off a bit bready-like
The taste was basically the same.
The palate sat at/about a light to medium, somewhat sessionable, seems like it has the right amount of carbonation and good for me as well.
Overall, well, I say this is good for the style and good for me, I would come back to this and that says a lot since Im not a true fan of this style.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1705,"2014-02-28",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2015 (Re-rated on 30/5/2015)

Rationale: from previous tasting, I thought the bottle I had from my local German restaurant was faulted and it might have lost much of the taste. So I give it another try with a well-kept bottle from a beer shop to give it one final test to see if this one is really for real, or just a dud! So here goes

500ml bottle bought at Cheers in Yuen Long.
Looks: Cloudy hazy straw brown colour with a thick layer of dark brown yeast sediments; One and a quarter finger head with crumpety white foam which lasted for 3 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing and quite fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Fragment light malt, with fairly strong wheat and tartness, banana, strong vanilla, strong caramel, light toffee, sugar, strong ester, cloves, strong spices, strong yeast, light lemon and thin grass.

Taste: Close to light sweet malt, with ripe banana, strong caramel, strong wheaty tartness, vanilla, cloves, strong spices, strong yeast, lemon, moderate bitter hops, and notable light grass. 

Body: Close to medium body. Thin yet slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: solid maltyness with strong wheaty presence. Tartness is notable but still moderate. Strong caramel and phenol and yeasty as hell, with probably the spiciest taste I ever have from a Weiss, its that strong! Fairly good banana ester to good with strong lemony hops. Spunky!

Hoppiness: Lemon and faint grassy hops in nose, and much stronger and energetic in taste.Bitterness is a lot stronger than most Weiss for a lasting, moderate stringent malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Quite creamy and hoppy to mouth.

Comments: Now this is much much better than the (probably) leaky restaurant bottle I had last year. With a strong smooth malty body, rich estery aroma and very spicy and hoppy taste, I certainly dig this, a close call to Neumarkter Lammsbräu Weisse, through not as sparkling as Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier. Still, Recommended!

500 ml bottle as Schneider Weisse Tap 7 Unser Original bought at Berliner Restaurant in Olympian City, Tai Kok Tsui.
Cloudy hazy straw brown colour with a thick layer of dark brown yeast sediments; Two finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with notable small carbonation; Slightly fragment aroma of light malt, with light banana, light vanilla, sugar, light bubblegum, caramel, light cloves and very light grass; Tart and near zero sweet taste of light malt, with light banana, faint cherry, light caramel, faint alcohol, yeast, light lemon and faint grass; Mid to light body, very thin and slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is close to watery and lack of taste despite the thickish looks. Moderate wheat tartness, banana estery taste is close to minimal. Yeast and phenolic are very light. Boring Hoppiness is faint grass nose, very light lemon and faint grass taste. Background hop notes only, just very light wheaty tart finish; Fairly dry after taste, very easy and to mouth.

Comments: I had a lot of expectation with Schneiders Orginal, and I am really let down by this - strawy muddy looks, very light aroma, watery mouth feel with no crispiness, and taste is close to minimal. Really taste like nothing. Below average and disappointing.

Bolton Brew.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","BoltonDK"
1705,"2013-12-02",3.2,"Pours a beautiful dark wood colour, with a very clear profile. The head is nonexistent (from a bottle). Aroma of burning sugars, almost like the kitchen aroma when making caramel. You might love the aroma or be left wanting a bit more. I was quite happy.

I like the wheat profile from the first few sips. A classic weisse with a maltiness that provides for an excellent sweetness.

Surprisingly well carbonated, perhaps a dash too well. The lingering sweetness a minute or two after a sip, tends to lend to a certain flatness, or should I say a lack of well roundedness, to the finish. 

Surprisingly refreshing, however every sip demanding a bit more from this beer. A bit of balance at the finish would be nice, but still a great sipper.

1705,"2013-06-29",4.3,"Amber orange color with a thick head with good retention, which got light murky brown after a poured the residual yeast.
Predominant aroma of bananas, honey, bread and some pine.
Very flavorful and perfectly balanced on the citrus versus yeast. Taste of oranges, cloves, light on bananas, medium spicy yeast, and a hint of toasted malts which is good for a change. Dry aftertaste.
Medium body with perfect carbonation, controlled acidity and sweetness.
Beautiful wheat beer that is not tiring, and still flavorful and refreshing. One of the most balanced Weiss I had ever had, with its own character. A must try for who digs the style.

1705,"2012-12-26",3.7,"The beer appears autumnal orange with a thick , lasting, light tan head. An odd color for a hefeweizen, but still a good appearance. Moving on...The aroma offers bananas, clove, malt, booze...slightly sweet. The flavor is smooth and balanced, with banana character gaining strength in the finish. Additional flavors aside from the norm include a pronounced malt flavor with some candy sweetness. Less bold than some of my favorite examples of the style. That said, this beer has some character and pizzaz. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, this is solid, but I would never choose it over Weihenstephaner.

1705,"2011-04-16",3.6,"Bottle (500ml): Your usual German wheat beer smell here with a nice coriander & clove smell with a hint of citrus on the nose. Not as strong as some hefeweizens but quiet pleasant. A cloudy light amber colour that almost borders on an orange colour.Like most good hefeweizens it has a large, fluffy white head that has excellent retention. It looks excellent. Very smooth and medium bodied, going down rather well as expected. The only slight down side is that the carbonation is perhaps a little high. Very nice overall although there is definitely much nice, cheaper hefeweizens out there to be had. I enjoyed this one but not overly & probably wouldnt buy it again, simply because I prefer other beers in this style a little more. - - - abarwithnoname,wordpress.com","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

1705,"2011-02-28",4.3,"Schneider Weisse is relatively common in the U.S. as they have been exporting since the early 1990s. Because so many people were introduced to weissbier with one of the blonde versions they often mistakenly refer to Schneider as a ""Dunkelweiss,"" when it is actually an ""Original"" weissbier. This style is rather common among the smaller, traditional weissbier breweries in Bavaria, all of which are based loosely on Schneiders version.

It pours deep amber or light brown in color, with a bouquet full of expected banana and clove aromas. The initial sip is sweet and full, with a rounded and soft body, containing hints of earthy fruitiness. The finish is relatively clean. The head is creamy, but with larger bubbles than some versions and it does not hold as well as it does when fresh. I find that it takes a few sips of weissbier to truly get the palate adjusted. Once you get the idea, however, it leaves the tongue asking for more.

Original is a very consistent brew and holds up relatively well as an import (as opposed to many lighter weissbiers, which can become sour and tangy if incorrectly stored) and would never be a bad choice in my book. Im happy to give it a very solid score and only a slight lack of complexity relative to some of its micro-cousins prevents this from earning top numbers over the board.

Displayed a good deal of rising, bubbly effervescence, abundant, mousse-like, off white head foam, and clingy ribbons, dots & dashes of lacing. The aroma was light yeast and some grain, a little tartness, light banana, but more, almost overly ripe apple and spice, and a bit of sweetness. The flavor added just a touch of hop bitterness, lively carbonation, and a spritzy crispness, in a medium body. Still held on for some flavorful sessionability.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

It was by far the best option on their menu, so it was an easy choice to order this one.  The keg kicked halfway through my first pour, which meant that I had to drink mine from a freshly tapped keg :).  And, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered the same beer in 20 oz. bottles at Steve & Cookies by the shore in Margate, when we had dinner there on Saturday night.  I always love it when you experience a great beer for the first time and it is accompanied by a great time.  Anyway, the beer itself - heavy banana and sweet bread aromas.

Comment:

A nice and easy to drink wheat beer. It doesnt quite reach the same level as Weihenstephaner or Franziskaner but its trails behind like  close third. There are some noticable differences between the three beers. This one is allot darker in colour and has a flavour difference that Im a bit curious about, the smoke and toast. Feels like the two are connected, most likely to the choice of malt.

For me a good hefe-weizen is great on a hot summers day, its thirst quenching and easy to drink. This beer stands out a bit though as I feel it is more suitable for a pub then the sun. Even though I think it would work in both environments, it just doesnt feel like the perfect partner on a hot day.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

1705,"2010-05-15",3.6,"500ml bottle - $3.79 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Clouded, murky-looking, medium-toned brown body with a tall head stand comprised of Mother of Pearl-colored foam that soon dissipates into a few disorganized strands of fizz.

Smell: Punchy nose of darkened wheat malt with notably vibrant yeast-derived phenolic spice accents and ample whiffs of bananas as well as subtler notes of bread and caramel.

Taste: Initial malted wheat tastes of sliced wheat bread brushed with sweet dark caramel, but this is soon knocked away by the crackling carbonation and ever accumulating clove flavor. Lesser hints of banana and citrus lurking within. Very restrained bitterness, with that strong, pesky clove character doing most of the balancing. Modest acidity ushers in the dry, clove-packed finish with a vague remembrance of the upfront bready maltiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Moderate carbonation. Both giving a brisk, fairly lively mouthfeel.

Drinkability: This is all well and fine, but, personally, Id rather have a Weihenstephaner. Maybe Im speaking out of town, but thats just me. Paired well with the track ""Gay Human Bones"" by the relatively new band Harlem.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Definitely in the bernsteinfarbenes hefe; splitting hell and dunkel down the middle.   The aroma is richly bready and has a spicy banana bread thing going on with some chocolate in it.   A bit floral and sweet as well.   Definitely leaning more heavily on spice than outright banana or other fruity esters, which melds nicely with the malt aromas.   The flavor has the same rich bready character, medium sweetness, and a spicy, lightly bitter finish.   More clove than banana again, but not super spicy.   Just a tinge of acidity in the finish.   Mouthfeel approaching full, but still very drinkable and highly carbonated, which helps cut the malt.   Distinctive and tasty.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

1705,"2010-04-18",4.5,"Ive encountered many different wheat beers and while I would say Im a fan of the style, its rare for a hefeweizen to impress me as much as Schneider Weisse Original did. This is a beer that is not only delicious, but easily drinkable. If the majority of beer drinkers knew of this winning combination this beer would rival any American macro lager in sales.POUR, COLOR AND AROMADepending on who you ask, the proper way to pour an unfiltered wheat beer varies. According to the brewers website, Schneider Weisse should be poured fairly conservatively into a titled glass until about ¼ of the liquid remains in the bottle. At which point you should vigorously roll the bottle to stir up the yeast which has settled to the bottom and pour the remaining beer into your glass. This is exactly how I poured my bomber and the result was a perfect glass of beer.This is by far the darkest hefeweizen I have ever seen. With a body of pure brown which is also extremely hazy, Schneiders appearance might actually be unattractive to some. I didnt see any sediment floating in the glass but plenty of carbonation was definitely noticeable. The head was white, thick and fluffy and almost creamy like whipped marshmallow (I wish I had a spoon for it alone!). It did not leave much lacing on the glass, though.The aroma was a strong bouquet of malts with notes of spices such as nutmeg, clove, and possibly vanilla. It was very sweet-smelling, but with a bit of a kick.TASTEAuthentic German wheat beers are often very spicy and Schneider Weisse Original is certainly no exception. Upon my first taste I noticed a great combination of nutmeg and clove. What differentiates this beer from others is the strong sweet component it utilizes. I noticed a distinct flavor of vanilla and what I would call a banana bread taste (many hefes have a banana flavor, but this tastes more like banana bread  honestly!)Whats so interesting about this beer is the palate is evenly-divided and well-balanced between its sweet and spicy components. The initial mouthfeel is sweet and delectable with a juicy-like richness of flavor (especially vanilla and caramel). As it finishes, the spices are released en masse giving the beer a bit of a kick. Clove, nutmeg, banana and possibly cinnamon make themselves known in the finish.And yet there is still an unmistakable light and watery composition to the body so as to make the overall palate surprisingly mild. The flavor here is quite a work of art.FINISHThe mouthfeel is soft, thick, and a bit watery making this beer very drinker-friendly. It finishes smooth and clean with next to no aftertaste at all. BODYWhen Im reviewing beer I usually wait until Ive finished my first bottle before I decide if and how soon Id like to move on to another one. In the case of Schneider Weisse Original I really wanted a second when I was only halfway done with my first. Not only is it tasty and smooth, but at 5.4% ABV its a perfectly average body that lends itself to sessioning. FINAL THOUGHTSHonestly, its difficult to list any flaws for Schneider Weisse Original, although Im not sure I would go so far as to call it a perfect beer. Its delicious, smooth and fairly light in body, which all adds up to a high ranking. I wouldnt put it on my personal favorites list, but I can honestly say this is an outstanding beer and highly recommend it.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mkl7syUXdc","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1705,"2010-02-26",3.8,"16oz Bottle. [09.127 - May 07, 2009] Pours a pale, yeast-speckled amber, with a clean white rim. Aroma is more restrained than I expect, but gives off a genteel, clean cinnamon, spice and generic fruit. Very sophisticated and collected in some ways, as compared to the brash, abrasive hefes Americans seem to be prone to creating. Flavor thickens up and curls its hand around the aroma, squeezing sweet lustrious wheat sugars into balance with a tiny nip of hops and the elegant yeast profile. Delicious and classic.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

From the off, cloves are the dominant flavour.  Some foam banana sweets and fake lemon come through, but the sweetness of these is balanced out by the bitterness of the cloves.  More cloves in the finish.  Its a little one dimensional, but it feels good in the mouth and goes down very nicely.  Overall its a decent enough beer as long as you like cloves, which fortunately I do!  [Re-rate 14/4/11, 500ml bottle that Dad shared with me - cheers!] A murky deep amber.  Tastes of grass and lemon and straw and pepper.  Deserves its decent reputation, my only criticism would be that its a little sweet and could do with more dryness.

This beer has a very delightful and sweet aroma; sweet grain/malt with a touch of bubblegum and bananas and a faint innuendo of lemon rind. And flavor aplenty! As Nebulor describes, toasted-roasted grains and there is an accent of lime that makes that bit of astringency in the taste.

Its way darker than I was expecting.  It does not look like any Hefe Ive seen.  Almost like sewage water in color and consistency (brown and cloudy). Big, thick, white, creamy head. Aroma is spicy, maybe a tad skunky due to age of bottle.  However, I am picking up on cloves and banana.  Spicey.  Banana and clove in the mouth.  High carbonation sensation.  Watery.  Not as bad as I was expecting due to the color, it was pretty good.  However, Im sure the quality was diminished due to age.

1705,"2008-12-22",3.5,"A good hefeweizen that does not quite make the top tier. For me, this beer might suffer most from comparisons within the Schneider und Sohn family of beers than from comparisons to its actual style competition. Aventinus is a wonderful beer that makes the brewery really shine. This beer has a similar but toned down spicy wheat flavor. It is still far better than the vast majority of wheat beers. Schneider has an extremely special wheat flavor, and Aventinus expresses this flavor best. This beer mutes the flavor somewhat for a drier, less fruity experience. The flavor is still very good, full of spice and fruit, banana, esters. It is a very drinkable beer, even amongst other hefeweizens. The feel is a touch watery but otherwise very nice. The appearance is great. A column of dusky amber liquid glows beneath a frothy head.

Smell: The aroma had a fruity yeasty character that stood out over hints of wheat malt.

Taste/Mouth feel: It is very smooth and creamy on the palate with soft carbonation and a good solid medium body. The flavor has a big solid malty presence with creamy wheat, sweet bready and lightly toasted caramel notes. Flavor notes of fruity yeast, banana and clove are present and well balanced.

1705,"2008-08-23",3.9,"Schneider & Sohn were one of my first and best introductions to the deep potential of lagers and German beers.  It comes as no surprise, then that their Weisse Hefeweizen is lovely brew.  From the two inch thick foamy white head comes a seductive toffee aroma, sweet and sticky, with an added touch of banana nut bread.  Always welcome in a good hefe-weizen.  I also catch a whiff of dark fruit, likely a plum, but it’s more of an afterthought to the aromatic core of banana nut bread and toffee.  By this point I’m salivating pretty frantically, so I move for a sip, and am rewarded with another soft dose of banana, which then arcs over onto a separate cluster of light fruits, almonds and walnuts, and finishes slightly dry but with a maintained and perfectly pitched ester sweetness.  I’ve never found, nor do I expect to find, a Hefeweizen with a complexity to match a good ale, but as far as simple and refreshing drinking go, Schneider & Sohn have brewed another tastament to the potential beauty of the lager style.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Bottle brown, 500 ml
Appearance: Pours mahogany - amber body colour, hazy to cloudy in texture with visible yeasty sediments floating in the body texture, body colour is amazing for a plain Hefeweizen, it looks more like a Dunkel Weizen and the same with head, it is white but initially medium and quite quickly decreasing to very small what is again typical of German Dunkelweizen, at least according to my own personal experience. There is no head lacing and head is frothy in its structure. Carbonation of the body is very lively what creates a fantastic effects.
Aroma: Typical of German Hefeweizen, banana, clove, yeasts, all strenghtened by the lively carbonation, very well balanced aroma, not as sweet and alcoholic as the previously tasted ’Wieninger hefeweissbier’. There is additional hint of slightly toasted malts, burned sugar (caramelly like) and refreshing, gentle fruity aroma, apple like.
Flavour: Very well balanced and wheat flavour, for me much better from those Weizens I’ve tasted so far apart from ’Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier’, very complex and compound taste on the other hand. Banana, clove, a hint of blackberry or bramble, yeasts not overwhelming the whole taste but on the other hand no impression of being wattery. Some gentle notes of toasted malted barley and wheat grains, mature, pronounced, perfectly balanced, a real mastercraft. Slightly spicy and positive alcoholic warmth on palate. Finish duration is long.
Palate: Body is medium, texture is rather creamy with a mineral and tangy accents, carbonation on palate is rather soft, finish feel is mineral, salty, slightly accidic, creamy with accompaining floral hoppy nose, gently alcoholic in the end. Really a mastercraft.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

The mouthfeel is similarly lacking - while the beer is relatively full bodied and very drinkable, the carbonation is a bit lacking.

sensory first impression: Smells great, but looks rather murky. Head is bright white and well formed, but thins before too long. Lacing is strong and holds well. A very fruity and welcome first taste. Apples, nectarine, and banana are well balanced and very tasty. Thins out after a moment to a slightly watery finish. Carbonation shows itself through the murky depths. Visually, it reminds me of a mixture of apple juice, orange juice, seltzer, and just enough milk to really make it weird. Except for the milk, this is really its taste profile. But it tastes pretty good. Hops are quiet. Malt is nice, subtle, and warming.

Aroma/Olfactory:
Malt flavor is: nuts, toast, fruit juice.
Hop flavor is: grassy, light, citrus.
Yeast flavor is: moldy, muddy, mushroom
Other flavors include: banana, watermelon, raisin, vanilla, clean.

Visuals/Appearance:
Color is: tan, translucent brown, dusty, smoky. Sandstorm.
Liquid is: cloudy, and slightly chunky with sediment.
Head and lace are: thick then bumpy, then flat, then wispy. Disappointed by the lace, after a wonderful start.

Taste/Flavor:
Maltiness or Sweetness level is: light to medium.
Hoppiness or Bitterness level is: none to light.
Sour level is: very light.

Palate/Tactile:
Body or Mouthfeel is: light to medium.
Texture is: creamy, with a crisp finish.
Carbonation is: average or less.
Finish is: sweet, short, and a bit watery.

Overall experience: Not bad, by any means, but not a great beer. For a great rich experience with fruit infusion, Ive been enjoying Victory Golden Monkey. For a more reasonable alcohol level than the Monkey, Ive really grown fond of Flying Fish Abbel Dubbel. Both of these do great things with bananas. Schneider is more like a fruit spritzer, and much less pretty than either Victory of Flying Fish, but not bad.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

1705,"2008-03-08",4.0,"Lately Ive been getting burned by Weissbeier in Des Moines. If its not on tap, generally its skunky. I can tell upon opening this bottle that this one is not going to disappoint. Smells delicious, yeasty ad doughy, with sweet malt & clove. And I swear that upon opening this bottle I could detect a light smoky aroma, to the point that I had to check to make sure that this was not a Rauch. I might just be insane though. Pours a pretty deep amber, very cloudy with a great fluffy white head that of course sticks around. The taste is beautiful, in my years of drinking Weisse, I am surprised that I hadnt gotten around to this one yet. Very good sweet banana & clove flavors, but there is more going on here than with youre typical Weisse.

It truly is remarkable how the head on this beer stays around for the whole duration of the beer for your pure texas pleasure. Tastes like medium/dark wheat with a kiss of hops.

Had this again recently & enjoyed it a lot more, Dark fruit flavor w/a nice sweet malt finish. Maybe the first one I had was just a bad sample, or maybe Ive &quotgrown&quot as a beer drinker. Id recomend this.","Powellville, Maryland, USA","beachbum25"

You get the cloves, carbonation, orange in the first couple seconds of the sip, but it all falls flat and all you feel in the aftertaste is a slight twinge of orange and light bubble on the back of your tongue.

Toasty grains upfront, with just a hint of banana, a light nutmeg undertone throughout, and a faint sour note in the finish. Palate is light, almost sharply effervescent, with a bit of semi-sweet/sour fruit, and lingering spice.

It pours with a huge head and ooks beautiful served in a weizen. It also tastes beautiful. The banana esters arent as prominent as some weizens but still exists. It has lots of spiciness and it is difficult to imagine how they got so much flavour diversity using so few ingredients.

Appearance is darker than I wouldve expected, and the head is billowy and plentiful (reminiscent of a Belgian strong ale).  Aroma is clovey with some other spices.  Flavor is extremely smooth and of more clove, balanced well with wheat and malt.  Mouthfeel, due to secondary fermentation, is extremely smooth.  I foundt his beer to be extremely drinkable, and went well with my meal at Cafe Brucke.

The aroma is classic dunkelweizen: yeasty banana and cloves, wheat and dark malts with light citrus and just a hint of bubblegum in the background. The mouthfeel is light, slick and soft; very clean and refreshing. The flavor follows the nose with a fresh, sweet, yeasty front followed by a wheaty and slightly sour finish.

Smell; strong wheat and yeast aromas right away, with a little bit of bananas and hints of some citric fruits.

Taste; as with the smell the wheat and yeast tastes are on the forefront, and then the bananas, cloves and a little bit of a lemony zing show up. Theres also a really good sweet maltiness thats balanced with a touch of a spicy hop bitterness that im really liking. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice lively carbonation.

Some rind parleys with buttery orange meringue-saturated graham crust.  Lemony sorghum imparts a bakers chewing sense at the back palate level, most prominently in the finish.

1705,"2006-02-06",3.9,"From the bottle. 
Pours a clear dark amber with a great big fluffy white head.
The aroma provides a big blast of sour yeast, cloves, and coriander, with some banana and cantelope. The flavor is tart, almost sour, with fruity yeast; its also well balanced in its finish, which turns pleasingly dry without a hint of the metallic flavors that curse other similar beers. The beer is smooth, crisply refreshing despite being almost buttery on the tongue in the finish.
All in all, a very nice Hefe! Id like to try this head-to-head against the Weihenstephaner.

1705,"2006-02-03",3.5,"A nice Hefe.  A tad dark in color, mine wasnt especially cloudy, a nice head.  Aroma was relatively mild, low on the deep yeasty pungence that comes with many Hefe.  That characeter carries into the flavour where the banana and clove are less than I would expect, and a little more general fruitiness, and less pungence.  The maltiness is a little thicker and more noticable than usual also, and the mouthfeel is nice and meaty.  Id call this an ever so slightly dark Hefe in flavour, nowhere near a Dunkelweisen, but slightly in that direction from the average Hefe.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","sandwichpants"
1705,"2006-01-25",5.0,"Schneider Weisse pours to a very opaque deep blonde color with a huge rocky, white head, and a very lively carbonation. If possible, one should drink this beer out of the proper 1/2 liter weisse glass to enjoy the visual beauty, as well as the aromas of this beer. Hefeweizen is a wheat beer brewed with up to 50% malted wheat, and is sedimented with yeast. You want to roust the yeast by swirling it and then pouring it into the beer. Yeast is an essential flavor element in this beer style. The nose on this beer is fantastic. Tart wheat malt aromas marry with funky, clove, and banana aromas. The palate is a firm malt back bone, of pale and wheat malts, very tart and refreshing. Some nice fruity esters are present as well, hints of pear or perhaps melon. This beer finishes with more tart wheat character, and more of that banana and clove flavor. This is a fantastic Bavarian hefeweizen, a classic.

Started off good with a cloudy, tawny amber-gold body with surging fine carbonation pushing up a lasting, pillowy off-white head that clung firmly to the glass. Thickly doughy and tangy, apple and banana nose; quite peppery and clove-like phenolic, which managed to tickle my nostrils upon each whiff. It all went pear shaped in the mouth; Im still aghast as to how an aroma can be so powerful with no influence on the taste. Considering that all the receptors lead straight to the brain, my brain must have obviously dozed off as this was bland as hell in the mouth!!! Lightly zesty with a pronounced kilned wheat flavour that dominated the otherwise watered down and thin palate. Lightly husky in the back with cardboard like flavours filling the void and lasting through after the swallow. Finish is quite short and without the lingering cardboard its reasonably crisp and non existent. Champagne-like carbonation obscures things for the first few mouthfuls but after that it is left to fend for itself, and unfortunately it fails.

1705,"2005-09-12",3.1,"(500 ml bottle: $2.89 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) All these years drinking good beer, and Im finally getting around to sampling ""The Original"" German Hefe-Weizen.  Hmm, not at all what I was expecting.  First, the color is considerably darker than I imagined.  Its actually a dark, caramely amber, and only slightly hazy until I finally can swirl and pour in the remaining contents of the bottle.  At that point, the beer is cloudy, but chunks of sediment precipitate out.  It looks more like a Dunkelweizen to me.  And the head is all wrong.  Off-white, very fizzy, and the bubbles dissipate as rapidly as soda, leaving a pretty dead-looking beer.  Well, the flavor is more to my expectations, with definite banana-like esters, bubble gum, and yeast in the forefront, but the slightly caramely maltiness is again throwing me for a loop.  Theres a modest sourness in the finish, which helps to balance the beer.  In the nose, I get banana, clove, and uhm, apple?  This is one bizarre Hefeweizen.  Medium bodied, and well-carbonated despite the strange head action.  I think I need to try this again because this beer just seems all wrong.

The flavour was darker, like the beer itself, and confused me at first. Spicy wheat with some earthy and grassy hop flavours towards the end. In fact I think the finish is probably where this beer shines with a lingering tartness and wheaty hop flavour. I found the palate somewhat dry and the carbonation a little coarse.

Flavor is a bit of a hit and run thing. You get a quick glimpse of the flavors present in the aroma then the strong carbonation cleans up and allows for the bitterness to prepare you for the next mouthful.

The smell is very nice fresh wheat bread mingles with bubble gum and some tropical fruits...nicely done.
Ah great taste again i taste the wheat bread and the bananas,,the bubble gum is less present..nice malty finish..after a while a small amount of hoppiness appears but not much.

1705,"2003-11-06",3.2,"From a 500mL bottle. Murky amber, highly carbonated with an enormous frothy white head, fully diminishing, but a good cm stays long. Aroma is rather intense, estery with obvious bananas and bread. Mouthfeel is creamy, rather low-bodied, but tongue cleaning. The taste could be more complex, wheaty bananas are overwhelming, but it remains very refreshing with its lightly dry tart character. I guess that besides its color, it fits precisely the style, but just doesn't have the depth of character to be in the ballpark of its big brother aventinus. This and most wheat beers rarely manage to touch my sensible cords. Still, this is highly drinkable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

This in no way smells like a fish market. A middle eastern bazaar perhaps with the spices and the hookah smoke. A very good beer, this and Aventinus have become two of my favorite.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"

Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Rather inconsistent in the States, it seems...sometimes theres very little head upon pouring, and the aroma is often light and unflattering, and theres frequently hard little chunks at the bottom (like grains of dirt, rather than yeast).
