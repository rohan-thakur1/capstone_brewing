3144,"2016-11-12",4.5,"Poured into a tall tulip, the appearance was a pure glazy pale orange color with a quickly dissipating fingers worth of white foamy head that left some light speckled lacing.
The aroma starts with a big sour to bitter juicy orange rind. Rustic funk with a light lemongrass smell. Extra refreshing citrus juicy pulp.
The favor leads with a sour juicy citrus tart rind. Some bitterness (very lightly hopped). Lemongrass seems to escape from the flavor a bit. Mostly juicy citrus sour aftertaste running into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body. Mostly closer to the medium side. That juicy contour bangs some bitterness against the sour side to really nail down the harshness well, still, that harshness on my tongue seems to want to play but ends up smoothing out as well.
Overall, wow, just wow. I am perfectly enthralled with this beer. Thank you so much, Craig aka Sledeutah! You are the man!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3144,"2015-01-17",3.5,"Poured into a tulip, 11/12 vintage. 

3.5 A: First pour was a nearly clear light orange color. Every pour since then has been progressively more cloudy as is expected in a bottle conditioned brew. One and a half fingers of foamy white head that doesnt last very long, but does leave a decent amount of lacing.

3.75 S: Tart and funky nose. A lot of dusty, old wood with dry-rotten sweat socks. An almost acetic tartness. Just hints of wildflower herbalness. Hay and a small nondescript light fruitiness.

4.0 T: Taste is like the nose, but amplified five fold. Lots of dusty old woodiness, basement funk, and old crispy sweatsocks. Hay, light grassiness and herbal wildflower, hints of light fruits and honey. Acetic tartness. Very tasty.

3.75 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation with a pleasant spritziness to it. Super smooth.

4.0 D: Quite a tasty brew. I cant identify any faults. Give it a try.

Spice grants a little  pepper and becomes more prominent as it drinks.  Drinks light and engages you with each sip as the hops leave their touch of hay and bitter on the finish.  This was my first sour and I can say that its robust like ale, drinks like very dry white wine, has a softness to the body that is pure delight against the sour and is far more complex than I expected.

Flavor was funky and that is what I like in a farmhouse, citrus sour and a hint of spice on the backend. Balanced out with enough malts sweetness to make it drinkable. The mouthfeel was medium to light with ample carbonation.

One of my favorite Saisons to date I enjoyed every drop and added it back to my wants. Tons of flavor and the oak age added a lot of interesting character to the brew.","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

3144,"2012-09-08",3.8,"August 23, 2012 - bottle shared by sledutah.  Hazy gold with a smallish white frothy head.  Aroma - lemon, funk, wool, oak - very true wild/sour character, a solid 8.  Taste follows, but the sweet thick malt backbone comes through more than in the taste - still solid, but not as funky, more straightforward sweet/lemon juxtaposition, some alcohol.  Syrupy, a little thick, quite lively carbonation, very acidic indeed, from start to finish - dry ... simple, but very very good.  ""holy shit - this is made in Utah???

Pours a very hazy blonde color with a good head and nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is funky and lemony. There is a weird sort of powdery, almost sweet tart like quality that satisfies with one sniff and disgusts with the next, its weird but its not all together out of place. There is some earthy, almost clay like character and a little bit of hay. 

The flavor is very sour but not in a rude or overly acidic way, sour fruits are key players here with lemon and sour cherry being the primary ones. The beer has some earthy funk to the flavor and a little bit of leatheriness.

Having now had a chance to try this I applaud the admins decision to move this from Saison to Sour/Wild, this has gone way beyond the whole ""soured saison"" ala Fantome/Jolly Pumpkin/Etc.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

3144,"2012-08-23",4.3,"A Mes rate. Bottle shared in very good company at the Craft. Massive thanks to SledUtah. Greg, youre a star!Truely epic nose. Full on sour saison character. Just a superb blend of lemon tartness, the right amount of barn and utterly brilliant Belgian yeast and just a lick of candy. Want it? Ohhhhh yes you do. Dig deeper and the snout develops with some peach and really deep leather. You need to hunt though. Sadly, this is one of those beer experiences where its not about hunting. Its about drinking. We forget that all to often here. This little beauty is one of the most ""SINK ME"" beers Ive had since, well ok, since my last lambic, but my god it wants to be drunk. The flavour doesnt quite reach the heights of the sniffables but its still exceptional. Superb length to the lemony tart finish gives you pause for thought between sips... But if Im honest, those thoughts are full of DRINK MORE. This is a beer that is easy to love. Sour but saison. Superb. Greg, I owe you one. Cheers.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Bottle. Sour aroma with lots of depth. Musky peach, barnyardy funk, melon, grapefruit, tangerine, and a mild spice. Cloudy dark yellow with endless tiny bubbles that race up to a thin head.

This one surprised alot of people.  No one had heard of it before but after tasting it, everyone agreed that this beer kicks ass.  Pours a beautiful golden yellow with a fluffy white head.  The aroma is some serious farmhouse funk and yeast.  Theres definitely alot going on.  The flavor lives up to the aroma in every way.  An intense combination of funky flavors and citrus that end in a moderately tart and dry finish.  The perfect amount of sourness.  The palate is exactly spot on with lively carbonation with a very soft texture.  I used to think that most saisons basically sucked, but this shit really is damn good and just plain fun to drink.

The aroma is fruity at first; citrusy, melons, pear, apple with yeast, spring flowers, and I swear a whiff of bourbon following.  When this beer first appeared on my radar it was the top rated Saison.  I see its now listed as a Sour, and despite having qualities of both, this seems more appropriate.  Citrusy fruity flavors, herbal notes, wild flowers, some lactic sourness, lemon drops, wheat, and again, just a dash of that bourbon from the aroma.  Im not exactly sure what that is.  The palate is spot on and delicate, offering a crisp spiciness with thirst quenching sour citrus, all in a unique package.  Nice beer.  This really is interesting with some unique flavors.

3144,"2010-12-28",4.2,"750 ml bottle, courtesy dchmela. The one pours a cloudy, golden yellow color and topped by a thick, smooth head of pure white foam. The foam settles quickly to a thin film and leaving patches of lacing around the glass. The aroma is really nice and tart showing bright citrus acidity and fresh fruits. Tart peach, lemon, orange, and grapefruit all play a part with the underlying base of clean wheat malt and lactic yeast. The oak lends a touch of funk along with an earthy, dry, dusty character. The flavor is just as striking with the sour lemon and grapefruit up front followed by more subtle notes of orange and peaches. The fresh wheat and cereal grain malt are clean and add a nice base for the pedio and lacto bugs to do their work. The old wood adds some funk and a really nice dry, dusty quality. The body is substantial and really dry and parching with lively carbonation that lends well with the tartness of the fruit and the dry, dusty characters.

3144,"2010-11-12",3.9,"This is a really nice sour. Seeing the farmhouse designation on the label, I expected something like a saison but while this might be Belgian in attitude it certainly isnt Belgian in style, at least not in any traditional sense. Its a mildly hazed golden yellow after spending a month or two on a shelf in my basement. The head is of medium bubbles and leaves a few splotches of lace here in there. Barrel character definitely is up front in the aroma, vanilla and and a bit of coconut. There is also bit of a floral and fruit character. How the barrel character matches w/ the sourness is what makes this really great. The rich oxidized notes are seemingly at odds w/ the light, refreshing sour character but it somehow works overall. Think peaches and cream only very dry. The texture is light but due to the acidity, not all watery and the carbonation is moderate. Overall, this a very spicy, fruity, sour and complex beer. There is a lot to like.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
3144,"2010-11-11",4.0,"In short: An original complex blonde beer of some kind.  Cannot be summed up in a few words.  Very good.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Split three-way.  Consumed relatively fresh less than 6 months after the beer release.  Sent to me by footbalm.  Thanks a lot Eric.
The look: Cloudy golden-yellow body topped by a quickly diminishing medium white head
In long: The nose has scented flowers, bee wax and tropical fruits.  Intriguing.  Taste is has plenty of honeyed biscuit malts, lots of vanilla, fresh refreshing tropical fruits and tart fruits like lemon, grapefruits and clementine.  Tartness is mild and there is almost no sourness to be found.  Could have used more attenuation.  The above is just a list of known flavors but something about the whole thing just felt different.  At first I went after this beer because it was a top rated Saison on ratebeer.  So I was a bit disappointed when I opened my bottle and the beer didnt even feel like a Saison at all.  Now Im typing my rating and I see that it is now a Wild/Sour Ale.  Some Wild/Sour lovers are also in for a surprise because this is not wild and certainly not sour.  The truth is that this beer is neither a Saison nor a Wild/Sour Ale.  Its just an original creation that is hard to classify.  Excellent but not great.  Certainly the most interesting beer Ive had from Utah.  People make a lot of jokes about Utah and how they are rednecks still living in the 1950s.  But I wont stand for that type of humour.  Im more comfortable laughing at redneck jokes while sitting down.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The flavor is lightly tart, a bit funky, and lightly fruity with absolutely no sweetness and a lot of brightness.

3144,"2010-08-03",4.4,"First off, a huge thanks to Eric for sending me a bottle.  Secondly, screw you Eric for not asking for anything in return.  Seriously, I have enough trouble sleeping at night and now I must figure out how to repay your awesomeness...  The beer itself is delightful and the pour is rather striking.  Fuzzy golden blonde in color with a finger of creamy white head.  Bright nose is citrus filled, sours, light grassey notes, lemon, and more fruitiness.  Crisp taste is an explosion of tartness, tropical fruit, a little wheat presence, and lightly woody.  The way the carbonation fits in is just sublime.  More sour than saison, but delightful.  This rocks & so does Eric!","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"

3144,"2010-08-02",3.0,"Bottled. Sadly, I found this pretty horrid. Was this chardonnay barrels? The intense oakiness rears its head as over the top diacetyl, nearly undrinkably so, like pure movie theater popcorn. The flavor does a bit better at first, with a mildly tart, horsy wild yeast complexity, a touch of sweetness, but that quickly crumbles into a slick, buttery finish. Couldnt even drink this.

Pours a murky yellow-brown amber color with a couple fingers of off-white foam.  Aroma has notes of sourness, light funk, lemon, pineapple, grape / white wine, and yes some cheese (as other raters have found).  Flavor is very complex: tart with an acidic sourness that is actually pleasant, fruit (definite peach and sour cherries and lighter citrus and grape tones).  The flavor has a woody oak character that is quite strong.  Very nice spritzy tingly carbonation which really adds to the flavor.  Tart citrusy finish with some funk.  The wood character really defines this one and puts it somewhere between a saison and a sour.  (50, 348)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

More sour ale than saison for me, but it takes the best of both worlds and makes something truly unique.

3144,"2010-07-04",4.5,"750ml, second bottle batch, relatively young at under 6 months of bottle age.  The pour yields a gorgeous, cloudy, golden-straw colored body with a tall, smooth cap of snow-white foam.  Deflating swiftly, the froth settles to a thin, swirled film with a solid ring at the edge, leaving feathered splotches and flares of lacing.  The nose is stunning....I mean truly fantastic.  Citric acidity and fresh fruit notes leap from the glass, showing tart peach and delicate lemon, perhaps some nectarine as well.  Underlying wheat grain malt is fresh and clean, made tart by lactic yeast, lending a Berliner-like profile.  Theres a hint of controlled wildness from the barrel, imparting a dry, dusty, earthen character, as well as a touch of must.  Flavors are just as striking, initially intensely tart...nay, sour...as lemon and grapefruit induce a downright puckering reaction.  Softer notes of nectarine and peach add delicious complexity.  Wheat and hints of cereal are again ultra-clean and soured, showing lacto and pedio tendencies.  Dry dust and wild wood funk offer interesting contrasts. The palate is unbelievably dry, to the point of being downright parching, as fine, lively carbonation distributes the lemony tartness and accelerates the drying of the tongue. Forget saison...this is a sour ale. If a blend of Cable Car and Southampton Berliner Weiss is something that excites you (and it should), then you need to seek this world class brew out with a quickness. Stunning, stunning stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3144,"2010-06-06",3.8,"750 ml bottle shared by Maxxdaddy.  Pours a hazy toasted golden with a nice foamy white head- diminishing slightly.  Aroma is big oak and vanilla right from the start- some wine character, lots of American oak butteriness (not diacetyl though)some lihgt funk and fruity white wine- chard and sauv blanc with some spice and grapefruit as it warms it turns more to a torrontes- has a funky sourness and lemon citrus tart as it warms.  Flavor is a bit more funky and not quite as much oak which is good- as the beer opens up and releases more grape notes, more funk, more wild fruits, almost seems like a castleton in its funk, orange pez, citric and lactic acid, and woody tones- has some whiskey notes as it warms, funk tart green apple, with an earthy and leather finish and more fruit.  I think this was pretty good but it was WAY too much American oak all around and that kinda hurt the beer and covered up some of the subtleties while allowing out oak, vanilla, tartness, and some funk.  Pretty tasty beer, but not even close to living up to the hype of the first batch.  I think this was the second release?

3144,"2010-05-19",4.2,"2010 Release; Sampled May 2010
I could only let this sit for a week in my fridge before its siren song could no longer be resisted; as such I could tell it was still not completely settled as a haze could be seen through the bottle.  A standard pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a fat-two-finger thick, pale tan-tinged, off-white head.  The beer is a hazy, pale honey color that shows a yellow tinge to it when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of fresh cut weeds, a light ripe-cheese note, grassy grain, buttery oak and spicy wood aromatics; these last play a definite role here as the barrel seems to strongly finish after each draught of the aroma.  It is interesting how buttery the oak character gets here, this is very different than one would find, for example, in a Bourbon barrel aged beer.  A hint of orange aromatics that were noticeable at first now seem to have faded.  There is just a hint of tartness in the finish that perhaps boosts a very light lemon-like aromatic note too.  This is a very nice aroma, that is quite complex and engaging.

Light feeling as it first hits my tongue, a prickly texture belies an ample carbonation and there is a definite tartness to this that is so well integrated with the ample oak flavors it seems like it might be derived directly from the oak.  Buttery oak flavors lean a touch towards coconut, both of which mix well with the hay-like, soft, pale-grain character that is found in the finish.  Speaking of the finish, there is quite a bit of spiciness from the oak, as well as a sharp, barrel induced astringency and even a very soft, but firm hop bitterness that lingers just a touch on the palate after each sip.  A soft citrus note, combined with the oak, make me think of a buttery orange sauce somehow.  This has a fruitiness to it (that is boosted by the light tartness) that makes me think of a tropical fruit like white wine; it reminds me of starfruit, perhaps a touch of kiwi, some floral perhaps-peachy notes (this becomes more and more noticeable as the beer warms up), as well as that general, soft, but lush citrus note.  As it warms a vibrant, though admittedly subtle, grape character starts to come through; reminds me quite a bit of chardonnay grapes.

There is a vinous quality to this beer (the oak certainly helps with this perception) that reminds me of a fruity, oaked, yet flinty Sauvignon Blanc.  This perception is only boosted as the beer warms up from the mid 40s that it started out from.  In fact I would even recommend that this starts out at about 50*F (10*C).  The tartness is quite the anchor for this beer, it is light and perfectly acceptable for a Saison, yet adds to the complexity and boosts so much in this beer; it is just about at the perfect level.

The oak ends up being the ""dominant"" note here, but it is not really dominant, as the base beer and fermentation character play an almost equal role.  Really what I am trying to say is that this ends up being very well integrated and tasty, with a complexity that is there if you want to explore everything that this beer has to offer.  On the other hand, everything works harmoniously to make this a flavorful quaffing beer that I can see pairing very well with a plethora of light summer meals and lots of seafood too.  Definitely a fantastic beer, and actually quite unique in some ways; it definitely fits in the farmhouse / Saison vein,  but somehow manages to take it in a direction that is a bit unexpected based on all the other examples of the style I have experienced.  The buttery, spicy oak definitely contributes to this, but it works so well with this beer that I dont feel that this takes this even out of some fabricated, tight interpretation of the ""style"" that is Saison.  In the end it is the interesting direction that this beer represents that makes it so enjoyable and complex.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3144,"2008-10-25",4.1,"750ml bottle. with a HUGE THANKS to Eric! Puncy, tart and lightly sour on the nose. Musty, peach skin and pear meat. Nice mix of dusty, dry yeast, malt and barrel. Pours a beautiful bright gold with a very thin ring of white around the edge of the glass. Flavor is quite tart and dry. Plenty of funk. Apple skin, lively, funky yeast, barrel tannin, lemon zest. Wine like... buttery California chardonnay... but not nearly as flabby. Really reminiscent of a RR brew. Medium bodied... lively carbonation that compliments the barrel tannin quite well. Finishes rather acidic with a but of earthy funk. Wow... Utah beer doesnt suck. Thanks a ton for this one Eric!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
3144,"2008-10-23",4.2,"750ml bottle at Squatters SLC.  Beautiful clear deep gold color with a tightly packed foamy head that lasts throughout and leaves great sticky lacing.  Served a bit too cold, so I enjoyed the great aroma while it warmed a bit.  Loads of sour lemons, wet grass, light fruit, funky yeast, tart apples and a touch of wood in the nose.  Flavor is initially tart and lemony, giving way to tart apples, unripe peaches, oak, yeast and funk.  Very lively carbonation.  The foam continued to rise out of the bottle until the brew was gone.  Tart, dry finish left me wanting more.  Unfortunately I couldnt convince the server to bring me an unopened bottle to sneak out.  Seriously fantastic brew!","Beautiful Sunny Mesa, Arizona, USA","SuperDave"
3144,"2008-10-07",4.6,"750mL bottle @ Squatters Pub.  Pours a gorgeous, clear and bold honey-yellow color; thick, frothy white head with fine-bubbled lacing and retention; a beautiful pour.  Loads of tart lemons, bright acidity, and touches of white pepper in the aroma; immediately brings back RR Temptation: the lemon and funkiness, the soft wooden character (strikes a balance of oak and vanilla butteriness that falls somewhere between Batch 1 and later batches); gorgeous, generous, mouthwatering aroma that would be perfect if it only lasted a touch longer; great balance of elements.  Temptation clone?  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: this doesnt have the bracing acidity of the most recent RR batches, but the toasty and softly buttery / vanilla / oaky Chardonnay aspects are turned up closer to Batch 1; this strikes an ideal midpoint of both, for me; lively citrus acidity (grapefruit shows strongly), solid levels of lightly buttery Chardonnay-tinged oak and toastiness; fluffy, effervescent carbonation; a gorgeous beer, if suffering only slightly for being ever so close to something preceding it.  Im not sure if the overall complexity of this would measure up side-by-side with Temptation, but its very close and hits a particular note perfectly.  Medium finish: tart citrus (lemons, some grapefruit), toasty oak, very slight touches of butter and crackers; nicely dry.  Utah?","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
3144,"2008-09-27",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2010 same bottle that Richard was drinking, nice to share one with you again!! I really am ashamed at myself for not trying to put this Utah beer on the radar. Poured a very light cloudy golden yellow.  I really enjoyed this beer. It is so refreshing to see a Utah brewer trying to finally push the envelope. I have dumped a shitload of Saisons down the sink but this was very good, lots of refreshing light fruitiness that was joined by some sour funk. Very easy drinker for a Saison and a nice representation of the style, Kudos to Jenny the brewer.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"
3144,"2008-09-27",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2013 750 ml bottle shared with Douglas88 and Footbalm at the brewpub (cant take it out). Nose of light belgian spices, mildly funky yeastiness, oak, and citrusy hoppiness; cloudy yellow with a big, glass-lacing white head; flavor is lightly tart, lightly sweet, woody oak, and citrus; tickle your tongue carbonationm and a lightly funky finish; great stuff! A well balanced saison! 8/4/9/4/17 4.2 Rerate on 5/7/13","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
3144,"2008-08-16",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2008 Poured a cloudy apricot/straw color with a fizzy white head that reduced to a thin froth. The nose has a bit a of barnyard funkiness to it with hints of lemon. The tastes starts with light citrus notes then transitions into tart green apples. Next comes a dry oakiness that compliments the tartness well. The finish is a combination a champagne like dryness and bitter florals. Light and dry but highly drinkable. Oak aged and bottle conditioned at the brewpub. A great effort.","farmington, Utah, USA","mikey"
3144,"2008-08-16",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2011 750 ml bottle at the brewpub in downtown Salt Lake City. Pours a clear yellow color with a medium white head. The bottle has a ton of foam in it, and the brew is quite carbonated and fizzy. The aroma is very nice; an initial sourness, some strong oak aspects, a funky yeast and citrus notes also. The flavor did not disappoint; tons of dry yeasty flavors and dried apples dominated initially, some more citrus, followed by an awesome finish of funky barnyard flavors and finally a rich and mellow oak touch. The barrel aged aspect is done really well; it is noticeable, but does not dominate. The mouthfeel is fizzy and champagne like. An awesome beer, Squatters has done it again! Anyone who still thinks Utah cannot make good beer should try this. Ive had this a few times now and it is just awesome. Ra-rate: batch two. More sourness in this one, smooth and very tasty. Certainly fitting into the wild ale category despite my earlier inclination to list it as a saison. A great palate and somewhat dry.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
