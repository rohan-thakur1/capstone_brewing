3271,"2016-05-22",3.8,"Tap, Bills Beer garden, Ann Arbor, MI. Banana bubblegum aroma. Mild flavour. Sweet with ginger and yeast. Long warm finish.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","markas101"
3271,"2015-08-21",3.7,"On draft at the brewery. The pour is a foggy orangey gold with a white ring of head and no lace. The aroma is a good cross of bubblegum, Belgian yeast, and a stranger banana influence. The flavor is very similar. The yeast is first, then the bubblegum, and it finishes like a banana cream pie. Really different than I was expecting. The mouth feel is decent with a soft carbonation and a lighter finish. The aftertaste is strong banana and Belgian yeast. Not awful at all

3271,"2015-08-04",4.1,"Tap at the brewery. Aroma is banana creme, light bubble gum, and lemon pez. Tastes awesome. Sweet creamy banana cream pie and just a touch of bubblegum. Medium to full body. So smooth. Awesome tripel.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
3271,"2015-02-07",3.4,"Growler pour from the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy deep golden with a white head. Yeasty clove and bubble gum aroma, green grape. Flavor is similar, but kind of on the light side for a tripel.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
3271,"2015-01-11",3.9,"On tap: The aroma consists of moderate citrus, light banana, and a touch of Belgian yeast. Its a a hazy dull golden-orange with a small white head that fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate-heavy citrus, light Belgian yeast, and a touch of candi sugar. The finish has light-moderate orange peel, light banana, and grapefruit. Its medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation. Overall, its hoppier than most Tripels.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3271,"2014-06-08",3.7,"Aroma is of bitter hay up front with hidden sourness and caramel in the background. Appears a clear golden copper with a thin ring of white foam. Tastes bitter upfront of hay, there is a slight sourness, followed by a caramel and bubblegum sweetness. Palate is a little syrupy, and a little fizzy. Overall, good.","Redford, Michigan, USA","Petkus331"
3271,"2014-06-08",4.4,"Tap at brewery. Exceptionally well done tripel. Sour nose. Bubbly deep amber honey. Lingering foam. Tastes perfectly balanced between banana, clove, bubblegum, candi sugar and the ABV. Just a slight burn to balance the sweetness.","Michigan, USA","firstsip"

3271,"2013-12-05",4.2,"First impression is Im immediately reminded of final absolution from dragon meade. This is like an amber version of that. Slight banana taste, sweet and nutty. Strong after taste. Not a session beer, the taste becomes too much after awhile. Really worth it for any fan of belgium triples.","Michigan, USA","zedarian"
