1209,"2015-02-14",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2015 Draft. Major raisin and grape up front. Cocoa comes in as well. Tangy and delicious.Please note that this was listed as Barrel Aged Navigator (Beer Revolution, 2/14/15) but not specifically the brandy version. However, based on the options and what I tasted I am pretty confident this is the correct choice. If anyone sees this and knows otherwise please message me and I will correct.","Valley Village, California, USA","Ontape"

1209,"2014-07-19",3.7,"On tap at Elizabeth Station, pours dark mahogany with almost no head. Aroma is very oaky and alcoholic, with secondary notes of dark fruits. Flavour is very nice, with lots of oak, bourbon and wine, dark fruits and toasted caramel. Very well-balanced with a harmonious blend of different elements. Very good stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1209,"2014-03-15",3.8,"On tap at Belmont. Pours a brown color with a small white head. A big nutty and fruity, vinous nose. The flavor is mostly mellow dusty earthy malts, berries, a bit of chocolates, very nutty, the brandy isnt huge but very sweet, more vinous notes in the finish. Good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1209,"2013-08-16",4.2,"2011 Vintage Sampler at Ballast Pt tasting room. 
Dark brown color with reddish bronze tinting. Aroma of Brandy and oak.
Taste is very sweet and smooth. Caramel and toffee notes with a hint of alcohol. Also got a little bit of fruity flavor and definitely the brandy. Wish they were selling bottles of this to take home.","Austin, Texas, USA","vlan1"
1209,"2013-01-03",3.3,"Tap at brewery.  Muddy dishwater hue.  Decent foam.  Strong hints of brandy in this thing.  Sweet and stanky.  Taste is more subdued, lots of anise in this thing, which balances the sweet brandy, I suppose.  Nice stuff, not a favorite style for me, but good.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"
1209,"2012-06-19",3.8,"Tap. Pours a nice dark brown color with a tan head. Aroma is filled with dark fruits, a light buttery note, oak, brandy, dark bread, caramel, toffee and sweet malt. Flavor follows the nose with lots of sweet caramel and toffee, sweet malt, dark fruits, oak, vanilla, brandy and dark bread. The body is medium with a dry silky mouth feel. Overall a really tasty Doppelbock!","Nørresundby, DENMARK","beerisgoodforu"
1209,"2012-03-26",3.9,"On Tap at Old Grove Brewery.  Pours a blackish brown with small tan head that fades quickly.  Aroma is of roasted malts, dark chocolate, toffee, and some caramel, and some faint brand notes.  Flavor is of roasted malts, coco, toffee, caramel, wood, prunes, some hop bitterness, and some brand fruit notes.  Has a medium full body with a creamy, slightly oily mouthfeel and a slick bitter finish.  overall, a very nice dobblebock.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
1209,"2012-02-22",4.0,"On tap at Gourmet Haus during SF Beer Week.  Pours a beautiful brown with khaki head.  Aroma is a unique blend of malt with the barrel also lending notes as well.  Taste is fantastic blend of malty bread and some darker flavors.  The barrel blends well for a smooth, tasty beer that is too easy to drink for this ABV.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
1209,"2011-11-11",3.3,"Phobe rate. Draught at Old Grove location. $5/10oz. Slightly hazed ruby brown with a small beige head, fading to a tiny ring rather quickly. Barometer of rum and wood, followed by a moderate amount of toasted malts, scorched caramel and raisin behind. Flavor follows, but with a little less barrel influence (at least until 2/3 through), and the toasted grain tends to dominate more. Still has the caramel and raisin, never gets too sweet. Semi-dry finish, bitterness peaked at a 2. Full body, low prickly carbonation.  Not bad, but no idea why its rated so highly.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
1209,"2011-11-08",4.0,"Reddish/brown pour, cream head.  Aroma is loaded with nice brandy notes, golden raisins, caramel, some prunes, toffee.  Flavor is sweet brandy, oak, raisins, caramel.  Pretty damn good brew.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
1209,"2011-10-18",4.0,"Clear ruby brown with a slick of tan foam.  Aroma is candied sugar, sweet malt, honey, raisin, and some other very pleasant things I cannot identify.  Smells great though.  Taste is a dense sweet malt with some raisin/date and complimentary brandy on the finish.  Very smooth and clean feel in the mouth.  The brandy really compliments the sweet base beer - not overly sweet though and easy to drink.  Remarkable beer.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
1209,"2011-06-13",3.7,"On tap at Oakquinox. Not sure where my ratings disappeared to (its checked off as if I uploaded it from my notebook). Pours with a thick and lasting tan head over a very murky deep brown body. Aromas are fruity (dark fruit/esters), brandy, oak, alcohol, caramel, toasty. Long durations of flavors, dark fruit esters, light melanoidins, caramel, raisins, coconut. Very malty. Creamy with medium carbonation. Finishes somewhat dry (tannin). Good, but I was expecting more with such the high scores.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1209,"2011-05-21",4.0,"On tap at Urge in RB/Poway on the Tap Takeover night. They had 25different brews from Ballast Point that day.  Loved this beer.  This seemed like the perfect combination of Barrel Aging on top of an already big beer.  It complimented rather that built up.  Lots of movement from the sweet malt to sweet alcohol to warming and sharp alcohol.  Very very nice offering from the folks at BP.","San Diego, California, USA","Lagunitasfan"
1209,"2011-04-23",3.6,"A: The pour is a fairly dark amber color with a slight murkiness and a small off-white head.

S: Fair amount of brandy aroma with a nice dark fruit character. Sweet malt notes of caramel and toffee and a little bit of breadiness. There is a hint of boozy warmth, but some good vanilla and oak.

T: Nice brandy flavor with a touch of fruitiness to the beer. Some darker fruits like plums and black cherries, and sweet caramel malts. Oak and vanilla add a good flavor to the beer and enhance the brandy character.

M: Medium in body with a moderate level of carbonation.

O: I havent had the best luck with Ballast Point barrel aged beers, but this was pretty solid.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
1209,"2011-04-18",3.9,"Delicious, dark and creamy. Not quite opaque, but black with tinges of navy blue. Some vinous character on the nose as well as on the palate, but without excessive acidity and good hop balance, as appropriate to the style. Strong and warming, malty and sweet.","San Francisco, California, USA","DubC5000"
1209,"2010-11-07",3.7,"Appearance: Pours a coca-cola brown with a pin stripe of tan around the top. No lacing to be found, and even after swirling, not much foam action.

Aroma: Bubble gum and wood.

Taste: Burnt sugar,juicy fruit, wood. Finishes woody and sweet.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied, modest carbonation.

Overall: Very enjoyable, lots of big flavors. I didnt capture much Brandy in the aroma or taste, as the flavors and odors I usually find from a Doppel bock were very sweet and  dominant.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
1209,"2010-11-06",3.5,"Draft.  Hazy brown pour, with a small off-white head.  Sweet malt, dark fruit, molasses, caramel, oak, and raisins. A touch of brandy in the flavor, also quite hot.  Decent, Im not a big doppelbock fan though.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
1209,"2010-10-31",3.9,"Sampled on tap the Linda Vista Brewery. The appearance is a pretty deep brown hue without much of a head. The flavors and aromas are very nice. Sweet and smooth brandy flavors, nice medium roasted malts, caramel, vanilla. The flavors all gel together very nicely. The mouth is really smooth. Really nice.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
1209,"2010-08-29",3.8,"Nose is bright with brandy and oak, taste is hot and thinner than the regular navigator, tastes a little too boozy for my taste.","San Diego, California, USA","tokyogoat"
1209,"2010-08-26",4.3,"Draft at Ballast Point in Scripps Ranch.  Had this last year at The Ritual and glad to see it back.  Pours a thick chocolaty brown (with almost a purplish hue) with practically no head.  Aroma is complex and really good: sweet booze, earthy peaty malts, fruit esters (grape stands out).  Flavor is also very complex with smooth chocolate, tangy grape and raisin, port wind, sweet and pleasant brandy-ness, molasses, caramel, spice...lots going on in my mouth.  The strength holds up well to the sweetness. Not as much alcohol burn in the finish as I might have expected.  Very very good stuff.  (23, 365)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
1209,"2010-03-02",4.4,"Big thanks to Ryan for this gem, a 22oz bomber from CBX.

Pours a deep, clear copper with a small creamy tan head that recedes quickly to a collar and leaves spotty lacing.

The aroma is as good as Ive smelled for the style.  The brandy character adds a perfect boozy, oaky edge to the underlying caramel malts, chocolate and dark fruits.

Holy smokes, the taste is as good as the aroma.  So big and complex for a doppelbock.  Chocolate covered cherries, caramel malts, smoke and then, whack, the brandy barrel just leaves the palate with an alcohol burn and woody dryness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and super smooth with good carbonation - alcohol, wood, sweet stickiness, all together.

I have to say that this one just blew me away.  The brandy barrel really adds to the complexity and this is honestly one of the best doppelbocks Ive ever had.  World class.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
1209,"2009-11-25",4.5,"Tasted at the 4th Annual Bistro Barrel Aged Beer Fest on 11/14/2009. This dopplebock pours a medium brown color from the tap. Medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is brandy, bread, wood, caramel and sweet. A medium to full bodied dopplebock. Malts are fruity, caramel, sweet and molasses. Hops are earthy. Nice balance. Very smooth taste. Nice malt sweetness really complements the brandy and wood. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1209,"2009-11-13",4.6,"Tap at Toro SD.  Nose of a rather grapey brandy with lots of esters, chocolate, malt, raisin, bread, warm cocoa.  Color is a solid, velvety dark brown/black and you can tell its thick just looking at it.  Flavor is a nice tootsie-roll bread pudding brownie mess with the brandy nicely infused everywhere.  Even cold, this beer warms you.  Finish is rather long and full throughout.  I think the booze is an asset as it works perfectly to balance the toffee/malt sweetness.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
1209,"2009-11-08",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2009 On tap at Hamiltons in San Diego.  Dark brown color with a medium sized tan head.  Aroma is dark fruits, caramel, licorice, and brandy.  Flavor is caramel malt, raisin, and prune, vinous notes along with a huge brandy presence.  A little too strong in my opinion.  Palate is medium-full and smooth but a bit boozy.  Im docking this a bit on the overall score because I think the essence of the style is somewhat lost in the brandy barrel aging.  This barrel stuff is a little overdone sometimes.

EDIT: Had some notes from the Bistro fest that I failed to take into account earlier. This beer was a lot smoother this time - maybe a week of extra aging helped? Red wine, caramel, toffee, and vanilla stand out a lot more this time compared to before. Great dark fruits and caramel on the aroma. Brandy not as intense. Increasing rating accordingly.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Nose is lucious, sweet and candy-like...a little licorice, rhubard, and some nicities  Beautiful body...creamy and thick beyond belief...fruity, sweet, and creamy....holy shit this is nice.  Seriously, holy shit.  Flavors are fruity, sweet yet hoppy, thick, candy-like, and downright sexxy","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1209,"2009-10-09",4.1,"I think the commercial description is spot on. This beer rocked my world.  Nose tempts you with lots of brandy, but digging deeper youll find caramel and raisins. The mouth is notably sweet, the brandy is more subdued and background flavors come out - caramel, rasins, a touch of brown sugar and fairly vinous. Alcohol pops up a bit in the finish, which is the only sign of how potent medium body brew is. Wisp of brandy and caramel in finish make this truely a wonderful sipping beer, or as my friends noted ""Christmas Beer"".  Excellent.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

1209,"2009-02-09",3.9,"On tap for the first time ever at the Linda Vista Brewery 2/10/09. Pours an opaque magenta hue, off-white creamy head sustains, good clarity. Nose is big brandy notes, dark fruit, and wood. Taste is a brandy bomb with oak, vanilla, cherries, thick bready malts consistently in the background, finishes sweet with moderate alcohol warming, complex and flavorful. Full-bodied, moderate carbonation, thick chewy texture. Overall, a tasty and unique variation on the BP doppelbock, the typical malt/melanoidin profile for the style is completely subsumed by the brandy and wood flavors, off-style but thoroughly enjoyable (note that this was aged for 8-9 months before being blended with ~10% of a fresh batch of Navigator to cut some of the brandy flavor).","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"
