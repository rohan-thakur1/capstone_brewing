4185,"2016-10-26",3.8,"Draft @ Brauerei Kneitinger, Nov. 2015. Deep garnet with high clarity. Off-tan head is well-retained. Complex and singular aroma of maple, hazelnut, cassis, plum puree, and a hint of tar, java, and black licorice. Soft and tight carbonation. Opens up with a chocolate-dabbed toffee punch of Munich malt which adorns the snappy body. Bold coffee flavors trail alongside an earthy cocoa touch. Very low sugar content, almost to a fault, even though the malt features all the notes I look for. Short-lived candyish viscosity recalls maple sugar before a breadcrusty richness takes foothold. A finessed kiss of soft Hallertau contributes to the remarkable overall refinement. Finishes with light sappy touches amid a hint of maple sugar which is offset by dry and smoky, cocoa-tinged roast and fallen-leaf dimensions. Similar to their polished and delightful dunkel, only this has more intensity. Nice to find such a quaffable dunkler bock with all the malt complexity and elegance, yet without the overaggressive sugars. Another impeccably brewed beer from Kneitinger.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4185,"2014-10-17",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
This flavorful Dunkler Bock develops raisins, earth and honeyed dates in a lean body.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the hazy brown.
-This felt drier than the usual Dunkler Bock.
-Flavor profile could be tighter.
-Bitterness is light.
-Mild toastiness appears as well.

Der Antrunk ist malzig-vollmundig und schön voluminös. Zum Hauptteil hin wird das Bier noch ein kleines Bisschen intensiver und schön malzig, allerdings finde ich es ein kleines Bisschen zu süß. Zum Nachgeschmack wird es allerdings etwas flacher. Der Nachgeschmack ist trocken-süßlich und nicht mehr so schön lecker und süffig wie der Hauptteil. Allerdings nicht wirklich schlecht, sondern eher etwas langweiliger. Geschmacklich ist der Nachgeschmack mittellang anhaltend und malzig-süßlich, allerdings etwas charakterlos im Vergleich zum Rest.

Color is dark brown to amber-red with hints of orange in the light. Aroma is typical Pils/Münchner malt, very sweet with caramel forward, a slight citrusy/lemony aroma... a hint of hops in the nose, too. Its 6.5%.
In the initial drink you can taste the alcohol on the front of the tongue, a very slight burning sensation all over the tongue. Its very caramel & malt forward in taste, slightly sour in the back with not a strong but noticeable bitterness from Noble hops - in the back and aftertaste only, though. The mouthfeel is thick and süffig, inviting you to drink more. It comes across a little like a caramel and beer flavored brandy.
