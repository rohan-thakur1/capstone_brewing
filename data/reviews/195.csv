195,"2016-11-21",5.0,"Had this on ""Country Sunday"" at Cellarmaker. The beertenders there were wearing shirts that read: ""I listen to Merle Haggard and drink Cellarmaker beer"". How apropos, given the name of this beer, which is a pun on Dolly Partons late music partner. One nit with Cellarmakers commercial description...I actually think the viscosity is probably 0W-20 or 5W-20.","Mountain View, California, USA","dpitinga"
