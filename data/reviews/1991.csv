1991,"2017-05-06",3.1,"Thanks for the bottle Helen!
Poured into a mug, the appearance was a muddy brown color with a finger and a halfs worth of sly tan foamy head. Milky lace.
The aroma had the normal Nogne initial smell - coca cola followed but some hazelnuts, light milk and dark chocolate. Subtle grassy hops.
The flavor was exceptionally sweet, that coca cola taste didnt meld enough with the hazelnuts. The malt had some roastiness to it. Aftertaste was coca cola and hazelnut with a clean sweet finish.
The feel was semi-cloying as the coca cola flavor produced a slick semi-oily texture. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine.
Overall, Nogne does something to their beers that I dont know what it is, that coca cola syrupy thing just seems to not do it for me so much.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Not a bad brown ale at all. I generally find brown ales to be fairly malty and boring, but this one, even thought its still malty, isnt boring.

Barwa rubinowo-miedziana, dość klarowna (cały osad został na spodzie butelki). Aromat z butelki likierowo-karmelowy. Po przelaniu do szkła nadal czuć karmel, alkoholowe nuty mniej wyraźne, amerykańskich chmieli nie czuć, jest za to lekka czekolada. Ogólnie dość delikatny zapach. W smaku dużo przyjemniej, wyraźna gorzka czekolada kontrowana słodkim kakao i kawą espresso, delikatna paloność, wanilia, porto, kwaskowatości nie ma. Alkohol ułożony, przyjemnie rozgrzewa. Goryczka ziołowa, średnia do niskiej, fajnie dopełniająca całości. Piwo jest bardzo gładkie, aksamitne, nie jest ciężkie. Ogólnie przypomina dość nisko nagazowanego milk stouta o lekko podwyższonym alkoholu.
 Reasumując moim zdaniem jest to wyśmienity imperialny milk stout:) Prawdopodobnie świeże jest bardziej nachmielone, czuć owocowość Columbusa i Chinooka, większą goryczkę i mniej słodkich akcentów sherry i wanilii. Ja mam wersję z grudnia 2013 roku, czyli ponad rok leżakowaną i chyba to mi bardziej odpowiada.

Appearance : Dark amber with med foamy and creamy brown head.

Palate : Carbonation is quite soft but it suits the beer quite well. Medium palate. Quite a nice palate overall.

Overall : Really well rounded beer. Note sure why this is an english strong ale with all the american hops used. Cant figure why American Strong Ale didnt fit this.

Big malts then a balanced light fruit after midway. A fluttering between the malt and more orangy stuff finishes off the taste with mild bitterness that hangs around on the sides of my licking device. The remaining pour came out if the fridge so I assume a different angle. More orange and pepper, sweeter caramel, middle of the roast-toast battle, faint almost chocolate, mild Christmas candy memories (not the ones of cigarettes being estinguished on my corneas), last throught is of orange spice mic. A bit zippy and a long yes subdued bitter lingering to go along with soft lips. Winner. Dont get your hopes up - Im not thinking about you.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

App.:  Deep brown-black with a decent light mocha head.
  
Aroma:  Really nice cocoa, dark chocolate, some tangy fruity notes, a bit of molasses and licorice, more tangy fruit (borderline infection?), some black coffee, hints of minty herbals fighting to be smelled, a dusty/musty/earthy note, some dark dried fruits, a bit messy.
  
Palate:  Medium-full body, fairly lax effervescence, nearly still but not flaccid.
  
Flav.:  Dark chocolate, inky malts, plenty of bright fruitiness to contrast but not to overwhelm, some vague cola-like notes, molasses and a little licorice, a touch of alcohol, not excellent, but pretty big; somewhat sweet with decent bitterness and a smooth, chocolate and dark malt finish with some leafy hops.

A solid, clean, fun beer.  Nutty, bready malts out front that Id have guessed was punched up with hazelnut extract, but apparently not.  Very well-attenuated, perhaps even a tiny bit too much...the mouth experience is just a hair less rich than I expected/wanted...the initial sweetness pretty much vanishes after you swallow...thats good for quaffing, but at 7.5% its not exactly a quaffing sort of beer.

Aroma is fairly sweet with maple, pecan, white grape notes creating a soft juxtaposition to the woodsy and earthy hops. Body is luxurious, silky, almost fluffy, and despite my brain insisting that this beer should be sweet, its just not. Rather it is nicely balanced with I think a sturdy malt across the middle which is suitably not whisked away too quickly by drying hops, but slowly fading to dryness as a spiced cookie might. Flavor adds those subtle spice cake notes, gingerbread, graham, and some fruity hints of caramelized pineapple. Also find toasty nuts, sweet cashew, butterscotch, cider must.

1991,"2010-02-10",3.3,"Bottle.  Pours a deep, dark, chestnut to cola brown color.  A tall, spongy head of khaki tinted foam settles slowly, leaving dense sheets and clumps of lacing in its wake.  The nose is an odd character, showing loads of the requisite barley roast and dry cocoa, accompanied by a strangely herbal, leafy green element.  Hints of coffee and chicory are also present, as is a slight waft of tobacco.  Flavors are largely the same, again extremely roasted and toasty, with loads of dry cocoa, coffee, and bread notes (hinting at pumpernickel).  Earthy, grassy hoppiness intensifies the dryness.  This certainly isnt a sweet brown ale, by any means.  The palate is moderate in substance, lively, and nearly bone dry.  I think the bready yeast has gorged itself on whatever sugars this puppy once held.  Its a decent, toasty sort of nut brown, but the extreme dryness isnt my thing in this style.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The aftertaste in general, however, is not very present and carries a bit of disappointment on my behalf. Very nice mouthfeel, the palate is silky smooth and the alcohol is present without being out of place. Moreover: very drinkable. Good work by Nøgne Ø, though not quite interesting enough to make me shout the Hallelujahs.

1991,"2009-05-24",3.7,"500ml bottle. Batch 403 Brewed 15.12.08 BB 15.12.13...all handwritten!
Slightly murky deep bronze body with decent sized light tan head with excellent persistance and clumpy lace.
Nutty malts on the nose. Hints of chocolate, liquorice, toffee and medium roast coffee. Some citrusy hops in the mix, plenty of grapefruit and grass.
Smooth texture, big lengthy sticky malt body, low carbonation.
Nicely rounded malt body, nuts, toffee, chocolate, with well intergrated hop citrus, bitter orange, grass and a hint of dried fruit. Finishes quite bitter, a hint of roast astrigency. Alcohol slightly apparent on finish.
Very nice brown ale in general. Good mouthfeel, good malt flavour, welcome hops, finish is probably the only thing I can fault.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

The aroma is sweet with nuts hitting you at first, then comes notes of malt, caramel, alcohol, and brown sugar.

1991,"2007-09-27",3.5,"Pours an extremely dark, impenetrable chestnut with violet and crimson hues at the perimeter. A beige head is thick, creamy and very slowly diminishing. Lacing is thick and almost fully covering. The aroma is very nutty and pleasantly lactic, fresh cream nuances parading within the confines of the open space inside the top portion of the snifter. A blend of caramel nougat, chocolate syrup and bitter cocoa powder follow, then peanut oil, toffee bricks, spicy and grassy hops, mild hints of soy and overprocessed/overutilized sugars. Alcohol is moderate to heavy. Im finding that most beers from this brewery seem to make no effort to conceal alcohol. The flavor is not as exciting or palatable as the nose indicated. Malt is primarily toasted, some roasted beyond that. Nutty character is accellerated. Lactic acidity and spice are ever-growing. Chocolate sweetness quickly turns dusty and barren. Hints of soil rifle the tastebuds into slumbering submission. A mild astringency dices through the hop resins, then the malt. The finish is nutty, slowly drying, turbulent, lightly to moderately warming, with lingering caramel, milk chocolate and peanut. Grassiness is very strong and fresh throughout the experience but never feels overtly ""green"". The mouthfeel is adequately carbonated(sometimes a touch fizzy), has watery pockets but for the most part is medium-full bodied, stuttered in its flow and spicy/biting/pseudo-tannic.

Fruity notes of blackberries and dark cherries.  Mixing the sumptuous malted body with the chocolate and fruity flavours really makes you feel like youre drinking a cake.  Leafy hops add a surprising orange flavour to the mix.  Super nice mature beer that doesnt need additional work.

Aroma of caramel malt with some buts and light hops is very interesting. Taste is maltier then expected with huge caramel malt with some nuts. The finish is slightly bitter but less then expected for an Imperial brown ale; it appear that the imperial is related to the malt as opposed to the hops which is quite interesting. Body is above average with some medium carbonation. Overall, I would say that this was a well done beer  in what is often a boring style.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

1991,"2007-02-21",4.0,"Not what youre looking for, if youre a fan of mild British brown ales. This is actually quite hoppy and very full bodied. Good looking reddish brown colour with a quite solid foamy head. Aroma and flavour dominated by roasted malts, chocolate and a bit of nuts. For some reason I thought this to be almost stout-like - perhaps because of the bitter aftertaste and the very full, smooth body.
Interesting and very well made beer.","DENMARK","Sofajoern"
1991,"2007-02-20",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Elaborate caramel and nuttiness travels into teriyaki territory, a luxurious maltiness which gently sweeps into a grassy supporting hoppiness. A creamy, flavorful, classy strong Brown Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-Frothy foam settles atop the russet brown.
-Roastiness and toastiness add crunch.
-The fiery carbonation improves after letting the glass breathe, letting the wondrous malt shine through.
-The finishing bitterness isnt too important, but it dries up the malty sweetness nicely.
-Light citrusy fruitiness peeks through the bittering hop presence.
