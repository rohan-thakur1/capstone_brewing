The pour from this is a darker golden yellow, alightly foggy, with a thicker white head that falls to a film. The aroma is full of peaches and apricots with a huge sour aspect to them. My mouth is watering on the smell alone. The crisp sourness is really selling me here. The flavor is a little better. The fruit is excellent. The citric acid on the back end really makes you want more. The funk is almost entirely pure sour, and I love it. The mouth feel is awesome. Its light and crisp with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly peach and apricot on the finish.

3153,"2015-10-17",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Apricots and peaches seep through this Wild Ales funky connotations, leading to sourness and more juiciness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A crown of foam tops the hazy pale amber.
-Mouthfeel is perhaps sweeter than expected and the bubbling is prickly.
-Drinkability is relatively high.
-Although this brew is quite good, it is by no means worth the $$ they are asking for. It is as satisfying as most of their Belgian stylings which are in the 10-12$ range, so...

>>> Another ultra acidic american sour from Lost Abbey. It carries a really nice citrusy fruitiness though.

+  Good looking beer with a slightly hazy deep golden color, a small but easy to revive white head and some lacing 
+  Very nice citrusy profile, the sourness that borderline hurts is doing a pretty good job at carrying the peaches, apricots and nectarines aromas 
−  Way too acidic and mouth puckering to be enjoyable in more than a few oz 
−    Complexity level is average  
−  The sourness isnt the only thing that gives stomach burns with this beer, the price point is way too high for a product of that quality

Yogurty life, lemon and grapefruit meet some nectarine, gentle oak and dusty brett as we flow on.

If anything, impressively understated, slow-developing, even impressionistic if youd be forced to compare it with the expressive apricot bomb example/counterpart of Cantillons FouFoune. Taste offers the same gentle ride through fragrant orchards exotic to the earthier Northern hemisphere palate: juicy fresh apricot and peaches sitting on a fruity tartness, reigned-in balsamico bianco, coated by prominent stone fruit and nut flavours, almond cake, scented vanilla sticks, going into exotic overdrive with touches of cinnamon and cardamom, young oak.

More acetic presence reveals itself as well - And so it begins! I have to admit I was excited for this one - It has a nice feeling of tart lemon and stone fruit , with wet oak and grassy notes moving forward - there is a touch of lactic, I suppose, and white wine is here as well, of course. Its simply nicely balanced sweet, tart, oak, fruit ratcheted up to an ideal level. A winner","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

3153,"2015-04-03",4.0,"Bottle. A funky barnyard aroma highlights the nose along with sweaty socks, heavy lactic acid, and light lemon juice. Pours the color of weak urine. Fairly balanced taste of sweet and sour; the flavors of the stone fruits blend well with a moderate acidity and white wine and faint oak tones. Light body with a somewhat sweet finish for a wild ale. This is the first Veritas Ive tried and I see why they are so heavily sought.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

3153,"2015-03-23",4.0,"On tap @ Lost Abbey. Hazed golden orange pour with a thin layer of white foam. Slightly acetic on the nose. A lot of juicy stone fruit. Big peach, apricot, and some citrus juice. Flavor is pretty sour and fruity. Tons of tart apricot and peach. A lot of lemon, grapefruit, and green grape. A touch of white wine, oak, and melon.

3153,"2015-03-14",3.9,"On tap at the brewery (taster). Hazy golden color, slight orange tinge, with a thin white head. Stone fruit, peach juice, tart lemon, funk, notes of blue cheese, nectarine, flashes of white vinegar, and mild yeast. Not very sour, just fruit, tart, and a bit funky. Fairly light. Good, but not quite up to par for Veritas.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"

>> Flatter carbonation from tap, bottles are carbonated thankfully- color is full haze peach juice/glowing light gold. No foam. Nose is pretty intense juicy peach/nectarine/plum blend with flashes of white vinegar. Taste is quite citric and salty, not big on acetic thankfully, underripe nectarine and plum mix with full fresh peach flavors. Its quite nice and clearly fruit forward.

>>  Low hazed light gold pour. Good foam. Nose is powerful juicy peach and nectarine, awesome, bright and leafy, super fresh. Taste is salty, juicy, moderate acid, tangy, bright sour fruit. Much cleaner/bright in the bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3153,"2015-03-08",3.6,"Draft. Cloudy apricot hue, no head. Nice aroma: peach, nectarine, apricot, vanillin. Flavor displays more acidity and less of the fruit, with pronounced lemon and oak alongside underripe peach. Just a faint tingle of CO2 in the medium body. Decent, but a little lacking in complexity.","","PartyFowle"
3153,"2015-03-07",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2015 Taster at the brewery. 
Aroma is fairly acidic with a medium light stone fruit character. Some light diacetyl like notes and a touch of sulfur. Moderate citrus and buttery, white wine oak notes. 
Pours fairly still with no head. Slightly cloudy, golden orange with a hint of copper. 
Flavor is fairly acidic with some medium light citrus. Medium light stone fruit notes with some light oak character and hints of alcohol. Low bitterness. No diacetyl or sulfur in the flavor. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to no carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an alright beer with more stone fruit as you adjust to the acidity. The fruit and oak creates a bit of a buttery aroma, but it does not show up in the flavor. The keg needs more carbonation. 
From a bottle the carbonation and mouthfeel are better. Aroma has no diacetyl but not much fruit either. Nice acidity and light oak notes. Better than from the tap, but still not super high in our stone fruit beer lineup.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3153,"2015-02-26",3.7,"Bottle pour at Lost Abbey dinner, Pours murky golden color with small to medium head. Notes of cheese, cranberry, and barn, not much citrus. Cheddar, and dry Brett coming through in flavor. Notes of acidic lemon funk. Not getting the fruit lineup in this one for the most part. Its just Ok as far as this series is considered and is probably a little young. I dont know, just not digging many american sours these days. Would rather have a barrel aged saison or lambic honestly. It was still the best beer of the night with the cuvée Tomme and framboise amarosa being ultra metallic and acidic. Been going to lost Abbey dinner for 6-7 years now and I have to say this lineup and food was very lackluster. Not sure if Ill be back next time.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

Apricots. Grapes. Mulberries. Passionfruit. Soft oak barrel tannins. Very fragrant aroma. Hint of fresh butter in the nose. Not a single bad note. Quite tart but beautifully rounded.
