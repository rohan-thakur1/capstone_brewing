1151,"2016-08-18",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2016 Flaska direkt från Sante Adairius som hade turen att hamna hos min amerikanske vän och granne. Finns på Esquires lista över ""The 10 Best Beers Youll Never Taste"". En djupt disig, aprikosfärgad vätska som närmast liknar nyponsoppa eller billig mulltivitamindryck. Stor, syrlig doft med mängder av överjästa aprikoser, syrliga aprikoskärnor, höiga stalltoner och med ett litet inslag av nyponsylt. En aningen större kropp som drar något åt det torrare hållet, samtidigt som det finns en oljig tendens. Den fyller munnen väl och är stor i smaken. Inledningsvis en stor syrlighet som efter en stund får det att strama åt bak i munnen. Liksom i lukten är här mycket aprikos och aprikoskärnor. När den första vågen är över framträder mer subtila delar av smakbilden, där fruktsötma och lite strävare ekfatstoner får ta plats. Dessa ligger kvar länge i den långsamt skiftande smakbilden. Riktigt gott med en komplex och växande smakbild. Den tappar liksom aldrig stinget.","Örebro, SWEDEN","Samuel214"

The pour is a hazy orangey golden color with a thick white head that falls to a thin cap. The aroma is full of apricot flesh. There is a lactic funkiness to it and it offers a little wine character. One can definitely tell this is more saison based. The flavor is a little better. There is a lot of chunky apricots, a light yeastiness, a good tartness, and a little funky saison wraps it up. The mouth feel is excellent. Its light and crisp with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly tart apricot and funk on the finish.

The Saison label (barrel aged with apricot) is far more relevant than the sour category in my world. Either way : It begins subdued, once again - mineral water moves to sweeping grass, which moves to a kiss of wine barrel presence. Stone fruit rounds out the back end, and again, its light.

Bottle pour at the Hill Farmstead Festival of Farmhouse Ales.


A - Pours a hazy sun kist peach color with a nice one and a half finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace on the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of juicy apricots, woody oak, mild funk, white wine, bit of lactic sourness, some must and a bit of sweet pale malt. Love the funky apricot.


T - Starts off with the ripe apricots slowly giving way to some mild musty funk, white wine, oak, yogurt and a bit of sweetness from the base malt. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish. Really awesome flavors working together make this one super easconsume.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, sticky fruit feel with a nice dry ending. Really awesome flavors working together make this one super easy to consume.


O - Loved this one. We drank a bunch of other Peach and Stone Fruit sours the night before and I would say this was my favorite of the bunch. I would love to get my hands on a couple bottles of this one.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Plenty of white head and lace. Great aroma of freshly picked apricots and oak accented by bright yeast. Juicy, delicate fruit balances atop the soured base.

1151,"2013-10-31",4.5,"Ive heard a lot about this beer before having it. It had a lot to live up to.

Its aroma wasnt particular unique, not of putting at all, but a little more funky than I expected and not something that prepared me for the torrent of glorious apricot tartness to come.

The beer is gorgeous. The color was a perfect opaque pale orange. The head was a bit smaller than anticipated, I almost thought it may be under carbonated. Turns out I just cant pour a beer correctly.

The taste was everything I wanted it to be. A perfect apricot sour. I shared this with a friend of mine who is a little too obsessed with Fou Foune. He said this was just as good, far better than he wanted it to be.

I dont even have notes about the mouth feel as it was exactly what it should be.
