4247,"2016-09-11",3.6,"12 oz. can, bought at the brewery. Pours a dark burgundy color, with a small, bubbly, fleeting head. The nose is canned pie cherries, vanilla, cinnamon, light dough, and corn syrup. Very sweet, with a bit of a tart bite. Light to medium body, fairly acidic, slick and fairly smooth, with a clean finish. I was skeptical, but it really does taste like cherry pie. Not an everyday beer, but truly fun and weird, and well done.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

4247,"2011-12-17",3.8,"On tap. Pours with a clear pink-red hued body with a white head. Aromas are sweet, bready, biscuity, pie crust like with some light acidity and pie cherries. A bit of brown sugar perhaps. Flavors are a bit of tart pie cherries, balancing acidity, caramel, biscuity and bready. Amazing replication of flavors. Light bubbles, slightly fuller body. Really good.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Pours a robust red color with a small white head. The aroma is overpowering cherry pie with cinnamon. The flavor is perfection for this style; sweet and tart cherries, lots of spices and finishes quite tart. 100% awesome cherry pie.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"

4247,"2011-07-04",4.2,"Huge thanks to jjfoodie for sharing this growler of a beer I have heard a lot about. 

The beer pours an electric, bright red color with a few white bubbles, but no real head to speak of. The aroma is awesome. I get a lot of syrupy cherry notes in the aroma, as well as a little bit of cinnamon. The flavor tastes almost exactly like cherry pie. I get a ton of sweet, syrupy cherries as well as some bready malt, vanilla and cinnamon notes. The fruit flavor in the beer is amazingly fresh tasting. Medium, syrupy mouthfeel and low carbonation. An outstanding fruit beer.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

4247,"2011-05-17",3.8,"(Draught)  Pours a murky reddish-brown with a medium off-white head.  The Rocky Mountain fruit beers are nuts.  Each one is exactly a liquidified dessert.  Aroma of cherries and pie crust.  Flavor of cherry pie filling and biscuit.  Well done!","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
4247,"2011-04-24",4.1,"(Draught at GABF) cloudy ruby with soapy tan bubbles. Nose smells EXACTLY like cherry pie, filling and all, crust, yeasty, bready, huge cherry pie filling aromas. The buzz on this beer started to build when people got word that the beer geeks loved it and the table was swarmed. Ttaste of very tart cherry pie filling, extremely flavorful and syrupy in a good way. Excellent flavor retention on the palate, perhaps a bit TOO sweet. A great dessert beer. One of the few fruit beers IÂ’ve ever had that gives New Glarus a run for its money.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
4247,"2011-02-08",3.6,"This beer has an intense cherry flavor. One of the best cherry beers if you truly enjoy sour/pie cherry flavor. The color was almost too red. It was very thick, the heavy feeling made it a ""one glass"" beer. A very good beer I am glad I tried.","Pueblo, Colorado, USA","alesandangling"
4247,"2010-12-27",4.0,"GABF 2010.  Pours a deep reddish purple violet with thinning fizzy head.  Aroma is big cherry juice, cherry pit, fresh cherry puree that you get in a can, jammy, with some pie crust and graham cracker.  Flavor is more cherry than the NG belg red- pure straight up slightly tart cherry juice and very concentrated flavors along with the bitter sweetness- and tart finish with some toast, graham, nuts, biscuit and a smooth finish.  nice stuff, although not something I could drink too much off.  Good after dinner beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4247,"2010-09-23",3.7,"GABF 2010, along with their blueberry, two big surprises at GABF. rivals NG Belgian red but aroma seemed rather lacking considering all the flavor than this beer possessed. Cherry colored pour& loads of cherry flavor here. Real good","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"

Flavor is just amazing, its like drinking a slice of cherry pie with a yeasty crust flavor and big bold cherry taste.  After taste is tart almost sour.  Overall this is one of the best cherry brews I have ever had.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"
