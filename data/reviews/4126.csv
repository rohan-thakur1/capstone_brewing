4126,"2016-12-10",4.1,"Bottle shared by Jason tonight, thanks for the opportunity! 
Huge vinous nose with hints of honey sweetness. Bits of overripe fruit and a touch of earth round out the nose nicely. More Cabernet than pyment really, but theres a light honey sweetness that makes it feel a bit different. Big and bold with lots of vinous flavor, its not something thats normally my cup of mead, but I could enjoy sipping on this a bit.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
4126,"2016-11-06",3.8,"This is a duplicate entry by MeadMe but Ill rate it anyways:

Slightly boozy smell (it?s 16% ABV) along with light grape and berries. Taste is deep cabernet wine, berry, honey, and a bit of alcohol taste and warmth at the end, but not so much that it is unpleasant. This was my least favorite variant of the four Aphrodisia meads that I?ve had. I prefer sweet jammy tastes tastes to dry tastes. I am not a cabernet fan at all, so if you are, then you will likely rate this higher than me. If you are looking for sweet like I am, I would go for the Syrah/Grenache, then Pinot Noir, then Syrah/Cabernet, and then the straight Cabernet. If you like dry red wine (I don?t), then the reverse order will probably fit your tastes more.Earlier Rating: 4/13/2014 Total Score: 3.8Slightly boozy smell (its 16% ABV) along with light grape and berries.

4126,"2016-11-02",4.2,"Pours deep purple. Aroma is sweet, Cab grape with nice earth. Flavor is wonderful and smooth. Honey sweet up front with the grapes playing perfectly off the honey. Light earth and a hint of tannin. So good. Medium in body. Not as thick as the others. Earlier Rating: 3/21/2015 Total Score: 4.3Pours deep purple. Aroma is very much wine like, with Cab like aromas. Flavor is full on Cab. Rich and velvety with a wonderful tannic quality. Light honey flavor but lets be honest the grapes really shine here. Great mead.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
4126,"2016-10-19",4.4,"Fantastic grape and honey blend....reminiscent of a big red wine and then the honey transforms this into a sweet complex beast!","Oceanside, California, USA","Floydster"
4126,"2016-07-26",4.7,"Bottle at Superstition, pours a deep dark mahogany. Aroma brings out prominent Pinot Noir notes upfront, followed by dry honey presence. Flavour is sweeter than the nose suggests, with an incredible red wine presence mixing with medium-high honey sweetness. Divine nectar here. An absolutely gorgeous blend of the red wine and honey. Amazing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4126,"2015-11-17",4.6,"Delicious drink. Aroma of grape, vanilla and a little honey. Taste of red berry, vanilla, medium finish. A treasure from Superstition.","","swaffd24"
4126,"2015-11-17",4.6,"Surprised by the lack of grape in the nose, given the 90/10 blend. Not at all a bad thing as leaves palate open without expectation. Very sweet and full bodied, it is like an alcoholic mixed berry compote worthy of the best pancakes or cheesecake.","Arizona, USA","beer_me_plx"
4126,"2015-11-17",4.0,"Honey notes and hearty grape on the nose, ruby color, nice balance of sweet (mead) and spice (Cabernet), medium body with a long finish.","Arizona, USA","a_yamamoto"

4126,"2015-05-31",4.4,"Pours a beautiful amber red, aroma of ripe grapes and honey with a of carmel. Wonderful flavors of sweet honey and grapes and s hint of vanilla. Viscous but too thick, finishes with a nice port like flavor. Overall an amazing pyment!","Arizona, USA","SmoketreeBrewr"
4126,"2015-03-30",4.2,"Pour on tap at the meadery, clear reddish purple pour with no head, still pour. Aroma brought notes of nice red grape, sweet vanilla, honey, floral notes with a hint of caramel as well. Taste was a mix of nice honey, floral, nice vanilla into nice red grape, touch of caramelized sugars, finishing sweet. Excellent.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4126,"2015-03-14",4.5,"Pours an inky purple. Aroma of Honey, with slight mint and black pepper from the Cabernet. Tastes, not surprisingly, of an excellent blend of cab and honey, with well-rounded tannins. May be my favorite Pyment varietal from superstition.","New York, USA","tchaos"

4126,"2014-04-15",4.2,"Bottle share courtesy of Dak, thanks! It pours with deep clear rosy red to purple body. The aroma offers up earthy sweet red grapes, nectar like red wine reduction and a bit of waxy sweet honey in the background. The taste starts with rich nectar like berry and sweet red grape like goodness and then quickly rolling into earthy red wine that only has a mild dryness to it to about midway. It dries out more into the finish. This is a pleasing experience as I enjoy the rich deep somewhat dry red wine notes blending and diving into the sweetness. Yes.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4126,"2014-04-14",4.0,"Deep purple/red color in appearance. Aroma is big on the cab grapes, berries and with slight sweet honey. The flavor has intense grape flavors, lots tannins and berries, but think that the grapes over power the honey.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","jntfan1978"
4126,"2014-04-12",4.3,"Pours a dark purple. Very grape, sweet nose. Very Cabernet forward flavor with a bittersweet finish. Very nice mead!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","MrBrightside53"
4126,"2014-04-12",4.8,"Nice dark purple/red color. This has an amazing grape profile that really balances the honey. This is the best aphrodisiac of the 4. If I had a friend I would try to introduce meads to that was a wine drinker, this would be the one I would use. This is absolutely amazing.","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
