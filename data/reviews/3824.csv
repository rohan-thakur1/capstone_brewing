3824,"2017-05-12",4.3,"Pours a vibrant rosy red color with a finger of gaseous bubbles that settle out quickly. Nose is upfront sweet cherry with a hint of vanilla, floral fieldgrass and some subtly tart earthy raspberry nuances. Palate is juicier and fleshier than expected. Huge fleshy cherry body with light vinous tannins, bright acidity, tart raspberry on the midpalate that rolls into the earthy spice that the cherry pits leave lingering in the finish. Masterfully constructed with just the right balance of fruit acid and sweetness.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
3824,"2017-05-04",4.3,"Right up there with the best belgian cherry/raspberry beers. Perfect fruit balance to the light base. Bright reddish pour, light head. Some wine notes and hint of flora apparent at the nose. FInish is a blend of tart, fruit, and wine nuances. Very very nice.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3824,"2017-05-03",4.5,"Bottle shared with Nelson at the brewery on 3/22/17.Bright raspberry-cherry juice color body shows minimal haze and a creamy, pink-flecked, off-white head that is well-retained.Just an overload of lovely minerality and varied bacteria and wild yeast. I smell the raspberry juice and then the cherry pits and skins and all the while theres lively Brett adding light leather and tropical fruit notes as bits of lactic acid round things out. Phenomenally bright, clear and clean are the fruits and perfectly presented are the yeasts/bacteria with little/no influence from the barrel (none is needed here). As always, the fruit is integrated perfectly with the rest of the beer allowing it to shine forth yet not come off jammy or dominant.In the mouth its tart with long juicy notes running through it, carried along by tight, champagne-like carbonation on top of the soft, wheat and malt-laden texture with light notes of barrel tannin. The cherries and raspberries add sweetness, spice, pepper and tart juciness respectively while the Brett adds tropical fruit and light leather. Tons of house minerality that you can only describe as ""Hill Farmstead sour character"". Lip-smackingly juicy, quenching and fantastically flavorful down to the last drop. Damn, they killed this one.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3824,"2017-05-01",4.5,"Bottle shared by Al, pours a pinkish red with small head. Notes of florals, perfume, cherry candy, kriek, raspberries purée, oak, vino and salivating tart minerals. Medium bodied. Cherry lemonade finish. Stupid fucking good like all the other floras. I can see why Shaun kept this on site for only a week and one per for CW members. He usually does this for all the extra special juice. Cheers","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3824,"2017-04-28",4.4,"Bottle. Ruby red, white head. Cherry, raspberry, wine, oak and funky aromas. Flavors are nice fruity, mild tart and wild tones.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3824,"2017-04-15",4.1,"375 ml shared by AdamChandler, much thanks! Light fizzy head on top a pink / purple like color. Aroma is cherry skins, moderate oak, mild funky Berry. 
The flavor has a good amount of juicy. Strong amount of cherry with light raspberry hints. Wine influence is unquestionably here. Tart and juicy at the same time. Carbonation seem low but it is ok. Still really tasty.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

3824,"2017-04-02",4.1,"375 mL bottle. Hazy red body. Smells of raspberry, sweet pie cherry, and a little plastic. White wine and oak. Tastes pretty tart. Sour raspberry. White wine. Cherry lends sweetness. Oaky finish. Lingering raspberry sourness. Medium light. Pretty sour. My first pour was yeasty and tasted like plastic. A clearer pour was significantly better.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3824,"2017-03-29",4.1,"Poured from a bottle into a sampling tulip: Pours orange / read with a thin head. Aroma of cherries, funk, oak. Taste is cherry juice, vanilla, oak barrel, and tart funk. This is a really tasty fruit beer.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
3824,"2017-03-25",4.0,"Another nice fruited flora. Thin lower carb pour with some fizzy head. Aroma is cherry juice, skins, light raspberry, mild oak, vanilla, and balsamic. Taste is tart with some light juicy sweetness and a mild oaky funk. Palate feels thin like some of these fruited variants tend to get as that classic creamy HF mouthfeel isnt there. Overall very enjoyable.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3824,"2017-03-13",4.4,"375ml bottle for on site consumption. Pours blood orange/ruby red. White bubbly head that lasts around the edge. Leaves good lacing as well. Smells very winey and sweet. Cherries right up front and oaky barrel wood finish. Tastes sweet cherries right away with strong tartness in your cheeks. Winey oak profile as well. Raspberries come through at the end. Great tart mouthfeel. Full but light and crisp. Perfect carbonation. Awesome overall. Absolutely love it. Another gem from Shaun.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Sudz4Dayz"
3824,"2017-03-13",4.2,"Bottle onsite at the brewery, shared. Pours a slightly hazy pink-white color with a few thin bubbles of white head. Aroma is very winey, very nice tart raspberry notes with rich winey cherry undertones, lemon. Taste is tart, citric, very nice fresh fruitiness, both raspberry and cherry are present and well balanced. Palate is light, fresh, almost still, just a hint of mineral carbonation makes it even more refreshing. Very tasty.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
