4371,"2015-09-13",4.0,"It pours the complete opposite of white, lol. Nice offwhite head of foam thats not a stayer but it makes up for it with the lacing.

I get smoke, chocolate, and an overall very malty nose With a mild hop bitterness in the smell. I dig the smell so....

Plenty of that ^ in the taste as well. Nice level of smoke with a very malty backbone that does not get overly sweet thanks to the ample amount of hop bitterness. It does finish decidedly on the malty side though and I am loving it. I notice some toffee as well. The abv is higher than I normally like for the style but it isnt intrusive by any means.

Fairly light bodied overall, the mouthfeel is still quite good.

4371,"2013-11-28",2.8,"In short: A sweet and slightly chocolaty black beer without interest. Very boring.
How: Bottle 750ml, consumed a few months after purchase but I think this was many months old.
The look: Black body topped by a persistent small tan head.
In long: Nose is very much like smelling generic black cake with a lot of icing, same kind-of-chocolate sweetness sensation. In mouth the beer has a heavy body but a soft texture and a soft carbonation that would be better suited for a 5% thirst lager than a big black beer. Taste is pretty much like the aroma. This tastes like a melted generic black cake with a lot of icing with black liquorice and molasses. Too sweet for its own good, chocolaty but not the enjoyable bakery black chocolate, inexpressive cake malts. This beer offers the sweetness of a digestive beer but without the depth or richness of a good digestive beer. Nothing bad per say, just very boring and with a drinkability that is abnormally low for a below 8% black beer. I keep buying Grand Teton bottles even if clearly I dont like this brewery, the 911 operator and the paramedics are right, Im someone who never learns from my mistakes.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4371,"2013-03-01",4.2,"My first beer that I aged in a cellar.... Bottled Jan 2012, so... about 1.25 years old. Poured into a tulip...

A: For what this is, the beer looks amazing. Pitch black, somewhat thick. Head is tan and creamy. Great lacing. Best looking lager I have ever seen.

S: Pretty complex on the smell which, again, for the style is impressive. Roasty, acidic, a tinge of sour, malt. Pretty much no hops. Chocolate... citrus. 

T: Tastes pretty amazing. The difference in flavor notes between the acidity and the roast is interesting. A yeasty note as well. Finish is very lager like being extremely clean. Alcohol cuts though a bit. Drinks a lot like a porter.

P: Sits pretty smooth but the alcohol begins to cut through as does the acidity. A little light on the mouthfeel. 

Overall this is a pretty amazing beer and hopefully a success at cellaring. I was only able to get one bottle so I guess Ill never know. Otherwise as this is, for a lager this beer is killer. Great flavor notes. Very complex. Great finish. Only a couple downfalls being the acidity that cuts though and the alcohol is a bit excessive.

4371,"2012-08-10",3.0,"Poured into a Stella glass. 2012 vintage, though Im not sure that this is something youd want to age anyway.

3.5 A: Black color. Two and a half fingers of creamy/frothy light brown head. Retention is decent and only the shortest of rings of lacing is left.

3.5 S: Dry roastiness and cocoa powder. As it warms up, this gets maltier and maltier. Theres not much else in the nose. Its clean and refined, but simple and pleasant.

3.5 T: Theres a hell of a lot more flavor than the nose led on. Potent roastiness, good amount of chocolate, a light caramel, and a moderate neutral lager maltiness. Despite the maltiness, the roast is still stronger than Id prefer, but not by much. Definitely tasty though.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Mildly creamy. Good enough here.

4.0 D: Tasty beer. Initially the roastiness is unbalanced with the rest of the beer, but after the palate grows accustomed to it, it turns out to be in perfect harmony.

4371,"2012-05-03",3.6,"Tap at Whole Foods in Schaumburg.  Dark leather color with no head.  A few select streams of tiny bubbles soar up to the top of the glass.  Faint dark cacao roast aroma.  Taste is fruity and roasty but definitely crisp and clean.  Breakfast Blend coffee meets stone fruit.  I detect plum and apricot nectar.  The hops are weaved very well into the fabric of this beer.  They do not stand out at all but are instead perfectly balanced in the beer.  Fuller mouthfeel thanks typical for the style.  Quenching and flavorful, Im glad I tried this.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"
4371,"2012-05-02",3.9,"What a nice brew. Pours a beautiful pitch black with tan head. Lots of roasted malts and chocolate on the nose. Also black licorice. More strong roasted malts on the tongue with some coffee and chocolate and anise as well. Goes down smooth. Good stuff.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","cards04"
4371,"2012-05-01",4.3,"This may not be a glamorous style......not a huge 1000 IBY double IPA or massive Imperial Stout....which Im guilty of gravitating towards. However, this is an excellent brew which should be tasted....even if you have to cover the label stating ""Black Lager"". 

I must admit that I dont normally seek out beers of this style, but after trying this one, I might start branching out more. I also have to admit that I havent been a fan of other Grand Teton beers, but this will make me go back and try their other offerings again. Very nicely done....try it!","Lees Summit, Missouri, USA","rlcnmeyer"

4371,"2012-03-25",3.9,"A - Pours a dark black with a thin layer frothy brownish head. The head fades pretty quickly leaving behind some lacing.

S - Aroma is a mix of roasted and burnt chocolate malts with some coffee, along with some earthy smells.

T - Starts off with some heavily roasted chocolate malts with some coffee and a bit of earthy flavors and some smoke. Through the middle, some more coffee and lightly burnt flavors come through. The finish is a mix of sweet dark chocolate, roasted malts, earthy hops, and some smoke.

M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth with a creamy mouthfeel and a dry and lightly sweet and smoky finish.

D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced flavors with a great roasted malt character with some nice complexity from the hops and smoke.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"
4371,"2012-03-23",3.6,"Draught at Bridge St Louis. Black chocolate roast hides the lager in a way unlike others in this style. Could be drinking stout if you didnt know better.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
4371,"2012-03-21",3.5,"750 ml. capped bottle. Vintage 2012  Pours a medium, beige head, with some lacing, over a clear dark brown (SRM 35) body....nose is coffee, hints of toffee/caramel, hints of smoke....taste is roasted malts, with heavy coffee, lighter chocolate, hints of toffee/caramel, light smoke tones, hints of sweetness throughout....mouth feel on the light of medium, carbonation adds creaminess. This is a lightly smoky, complex, slightly sweet, malt dominated beer. It meets the style although is (per the brewers intent) a bit big. The main ""flaw"" for the stated style is the obvious smoky tones. It could almost be a mini Rauchbier, but that could be just due to the heavy roasted malt back bone.

4371,"2012-03-06",3.8,"Capped 750 from Beverages 4 Less in Santee, CA. Pours dark brown/black with a 3 finger creamy/foamy/bubbly light tan head. Damn thing smells like a schwarzbier. Chocolate and malt. Near medium body. First flavor impression is a light smoke, next some really dark charred malt, then a little chocolate, and finally some grassy/herby bitter. Well, its not the lager version of a black ipa I was expecting, but its pretty good stuff. Finishes just not quite dry. And the chocolate gets a little more pronounce.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
4371,"2012-03-03",3.5,"Appearance:  Pours the darkest possible brown with a micro film of white swirls atop.

Aroma:  Roasted and toasted malt. A little wet dog, cocoa powder and bread crust.

Taste:  Slightly smokey burnt toast like malt. Bitter sweet chocolate layer with some Euro hop spice.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with prickly bubbles.

Overall:  Funky in a rustic traditional German beer way. Not used to this flavor profile, as Im Pale/IPA guy. All in all, a tasty beer.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

4371,"2012-03-01",3.4,"poured from 750 into a pilsner glass. Pours a dark chocolate color with a frothy head

Very pungent with aromas of coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, and loads of roasted malts. Good depth on the aromas as well

medium bodied with a smooth feel, but the flavors overpower a bit. The flavors of roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate arent out of whack, but they feel like they are fighting for attention a slight bit

I think I wouldve liked more balanced and nuance to this. Its certainly a big schwarzbier and doesnt aim for balance as much as blunt force on the flavors.","","Newk"
4371,"2012-02-19",3.6,"750ml bottle. Rating #4. Dark black pour with very little head. Coffee up front with a little sweetness following the coffee. Light bitterness, more coffee and a hint of dark fruits. (2186)","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
4371,"2012-02-16",3.7,"Bottle pours a dark brown with a thick light brown head. Scent is roasty, with notes of chocolate and sugar. Taste is the same without the big sweetness of the scent. Very tasty! The only drawback here in the southeast is the price, everyone at the tasting agreed $10 a bomber will make it difficult to compete.","Idaho, USA","beernovice39"
4371,"2012-01-31",4.2,"Pours a medium velvet off white head that lingers, nose is of chocolate with hint of cloves. Color is a dark brown not quite black. Drinks very easy like the style suggest, the extra alcohol did not change this quality. A tasty beer, put on your try list might be only available once. As it is a cellar reserve and they only. Make them once unless it does really well.","Kansas, USA","philtom15"
4371,"2012-01-20",3.5,"12oz bottle, provided by Grand Teton Brewing. Thanks, guys! This is essentially an imperial schwarzbier, though errs nicely on the side of restraint. Pours a dark cola-brown color with a modestly sized, medium-tan head; light retention and lacing. Aroma shows light roast, bitter chocolate, and perhaps the slightest hint of sulfur from the lager yeast; robust while still maintaining lager-like focus with no overt alcohol. Medium body; medium carbonation. Some creamy darker chocolate and lighter roast in a clean lager presentation; the alcohol does show through to a degree, but as a modest vinous fruitiness (not ale-like, but simply not an overt ethanol note; well-integrated); a tasty, robust schwarzbier thats restrained in all the right places. Medium-length finish: cocoa, dark chocolate, lightly dry.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
