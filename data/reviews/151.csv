A- Maple syrup, candied bacon, subtle brown sugar, subtle molasses.

A- Black body, black liquid, light brown head.

T- Subtle bacon, maple, mild sweetness.

P- Medium body, average texture, average carbonation, complex finish.

O- Again with these tasty porters from Funky Buddha. Seems like it should be a huge beer but its a tasty beer that hasnt been Imperialized and remains at less than 6.5%. Definitely lives up to the hype. I got loads of pure real maple flavor with a candied bacon secondarily that adds a light burnt brown sugar flavor without much umami. Somehow I didnt get much coffee. Im sure it helps balance things out but it didnt standout as a flavor that I detected. Somehow these all work well together yet shine on their own. What a tasty treat this was.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"

Pours a really dark brown color and topped by a small layer of tan colored foam that shows good retention before slowly settling to a thin film and leaving streaks of lace on the glass. The aroma is nice showing notes of fresh maple syrup, roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and some smoked meats to go with the dark caramel and roasted malts. The flavor follows suit and shows a nice blend between the rich maple syrup, roasted coffee, chocolate, and salty smokey bacon flavors. There is just enough roast there to add some nice bitterness while a touch of vanilla adds depth and balance as well. Medium bodied and smooth with balanced carbonation that leads to a lengthy maple syrup and roasted coffee finish.

151,"2016-11-02",3.0,"My Bottom Line:
Liquid smoke, caramelized syrup and portentous vanilla explode from this syrupy concoction, tainting the oesophagus for hours.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the dark brown mist.
-I was sooo ready to like this. Even had it for Halloween to be in the proper sugary mood. But this is NOT real smoke in here. It is certainly NOT maple syrup either (unless they tapped a telephone pole that was once a maple tree). This tastes as fake as most of the candies in my daughters pumpkin-shaped basket.
-The roasty bitterness in the back is a tad ashy.
-The Porter base is overwhelmed by the adjuncts. Malt flavors are few and far between.
-Coffee is rather muted compared to the rest.
-Drinkability is lower than that of the sweetest Imperial Stouts out there.
-If you are looking for something that doesnt taste like beer at all, and have a sweet tooth, this might be for you though.
-The end product is clean. But is so sweet and artificial that I cant support it. Give me any richly malty Imperial Stout over this any day.
-Funky Buddha can do a lot better than this.

The coffee is the resounding aroma up front with a sweet maple and a nice roast that lingers through. Im a little surprised at how much alcohol is present. The maple is a little subdued, but very good. The flavors are big coffee up front with a lot of maple on the back end. There is a hint of smokiness on the back that makes it nice.

Pours a black color, turning dark red at the edge of the glass, with a decent beige, bubbly head.

Has an intriguing nose, featuring toffee, bready malts, cold pressed coffee, raisins, old, slightly skunky wood, and a whiff of syrup, together with salt. Smells complex in comparison to its lighter body, tied together by bakers chocolate. Not what I would expect from a porter, but quite unique and very pleasant.

Has a fitting medium carbonation among a lighter body, leaving a lot of room on the palate for bready coffee.

As well as the nose comes together, regarding its complexity, the taste is rather one-dimensional and thin. It exhibits raisins, toasty malts and an extreme overload of cold pressed coffee, rolling over all the other possible flavors, hindering the beer from developing more subtle notes, as featured in the aromas. The coffee though isnt very pleasant on the tongue, it includes no cream, but cold ash and a metallic, distracting flaw. Developes an unpleasant mix of metal, cold coffee and sticky sweet malts in the finish, leaving back a nice flavour of roasty hazelnuts at the very back end of the palate. 

Tastes more like a stout than an actual porter, due to its incredibly dominant coffee presence, opening the tongue to roast and earth, as well as old tobacco and cold ash unfortunately. Its sudden turn into a sweeter direction during the finish seems a little off, as it gets unpleasantly introduced by a bubbly, metallic carbonation, rather than more fitting cream or chocolate - basically plays both ends against the middle. Evokes an overall colder appearance, leading back to the coffee, while especially the maple syrup should be able to lend a certain warming quality to the beer - it does not, feels more like a gimmick than an actual necessary ingedient, forming the appearance of the taste.","GERMANY","aleigator"

151,"2015-03-23",3.6,"I figured Id hate this novelty garbage but its pretty tasty and I think the brewer did exactly what they intended to so theres that going for it. This is a surprisingly big tasting beer, would have pinned it as an imperial stout based on flavor, which is of course mostly derived from adjuncts but still. Theres lots of maple and this does come off as sweet but not too terribly heavy. Theres lots of coffee and a slight bit of smoke. Its full bodied w/ medium, creamy carbonation. It is brown in color w/ a long lasting head. I dunno... this is not the kind of thing Id drink every day but if you brought it to a party and handed out tasters, everyone would be talking about it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

I just love how the maple syrup, coffee and chocolate notes blend together into something that reminds me of great chocolate confectionary or perhaps an American breakfast. The smoke/bacon is not immediately obvious so I guess its quite subdued and perhaps it just blends into the overall aroma picture so well. The appearance is pitch black with a relatively small but intense toffee head that fades into a thick film with an even thicker lace ring. Tasting it yields an experience like drinking liquid confectionary although at the same time not cloying at all. Flavour is very close to the aroma, carbonation is soft, body is full yet lighter than the aroma would suggest. Finish is moderately sweet but balanced out by some more polyphenolic chocolate/coffee-roast bitterness. This is a well balanced masterpiece.","DENMARK","humlelala"

Big maple and coffee with some light smoke and light roast. Tastes just as good. Again, huge maple and coffee flavor. Some nice lactose sweetness and a little salty, cured meat taste as well. Thin to medium body. Love the aroma and taste of this stuff. If they made a stout version of this with some more body, it could be up there with my favorites.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
151,"2014-02-26",4.5,"Bottle, sample pour  with thanks to gyberic. Aroma is deep, with layers of French pressed coffee, earth, sweet roasted coffee beans, mocha, vanilla, sticky maple syrup, and milk chocolate. I am not really picking up on any kind of bacon aroma perse, and I mean any kind of salinity or smoke. Aroma is pretty darn sweet and inviting though  like maple syrup covered pancakes (but less so than Mornin Delight). The beer is deep brown, almost black with minimal tan head. Taste follows aroma pretty closely with luscious milk chocolate and well integrated mocha. Big roasted coffee on the palate followed with sticky sweet maple, brown sugar. Some earth nuances as well probably from that bacon aspect, but still no smoke. Body is full, kind of syrupy with soft carbonation. After taste is mostly maple that lingers on the tongue for minutes and minutes. Overall a ridiculously luscious beer, but a bit on the sweeter side with a huge maple presence and brown sugar. The coffee and chocolate is mainly on the front end with maple on the back. I spilled a little on my hand during the pour, and my hand smelled like pancakes the rest of the night.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
151,"2014-02-25",4.0,"Bottle, shared by fsck -- thanks! Holy wow. Didnt really want to like this, but shit. Aroma is coffee, maple, and candied bacon, the kind that you roast in your oven that makes the whole house smell like heaven. One might expect it to be a cloyingly sweet aroma, but the coffee really cuts it off nicely. I dont really want to taste this, it smells so good. No, thats a lie, I do want to taste it. The taste is sweet, and though the coffee flavor on the end is great, it really lacks the roast/coffee bitterness Id hope for to balance it, leaving this awfully sweet overall. The body is thin, somewhat watery, lively carbonation. Theres loads of candy bar chocolate in this, and its impressive how much bacon comes into the flavor without this really being ""smoky."" Pretty cool beer overall.

Side note: glass needs to be thoroughly washed after drinking this, or else everything else smells like maple and bacon.  ""Heh, interesting maple bacon aroma on this unblended lambic...""","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
151,"2014-02-24",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2014 Bottle: Thanks, Kevin! Deep, deep brown pour, nearly black with a huge, fluffy, foamy, light-khaki crema that sits quietly on top. Aroma is quite mind-blowing, as you can literally pick out all three elements in the beers namesake. It has a thick, oily & roasted coffee bean presence up front with a lighter & sweeter balance of maple syrup in the background that leads into a subtly smoky, campfire & meaty finish. Coffee, maple, & smoke, done elegantly & wonderfully. The taste is comprised strongly of a big, sweet maple syrup presence on top of a hefty dose of smoked malts. I get more of the charred campfire smoke than actual ""meat"" but the balance between the bitter smoke/roast & the sweet maple is quite nice. Coffee finally makes an appearance as it lingers with a bitter bean flavor in the aftertaste. Well balanced, & again, all three flavors represented on the palate nicely. I really loved this brew, it certainly didnt let me down. Tasted like a morning at the IHOP in beer form.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Started off over-carbed, yet the viscous mouthfeel remained. A few minutes later brought mouthfeel nirvana. Bitterness from the coffee and milk chocolate balances well with the mildly smoked maple. Sweetness greets these flavors midway through before the porter yeast grabs the reigns, leading us to a dry finish. Taste is quite nice overall, yet remains a solid step behind the decadent aroma. 

Big fan of the Buddha, and while I *did* expect to be more impressed by this beer, it's only because my expectations are sky-high that they were barely missed. A fantastic brew, regardless, and I can't wait for more. <3 FB","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

This very intriguing brew appears a dark brown shade, with crimson highlights apparent when held to the light. The head is about a quarter inch thick, and settles down to a thin layer atop the beer. The smell is just awesome. Wow! Scents of maple, vanilla, smoke, chocolate and a robust coffee presence make for a world class aroma. The taste does not disappoint, though it doesnt quite live up to the promises of the fabulous aroma. Fresh coffee and maple syrup are blended to perfection, with some chocolate and vanilla notes coming in behind. I actually thought this beer was higher in alcohol. Highly drinkable - I could sip this all night. In fact, thats what I did.

A - Pours very dark brown, might as well be black, with a small half finger tall off white head leaving spotty streaks of lace down parts of the glass.

S - Smells of a TON of maple syrup, fresh brewed coffee, smokey dark roasted malt and a touch of chocolate malt. The rauch character grows as it sits in the glass.

T - Starts off with plenty of intense maple syrup sweetness slowly giving way to hints of coffee, chocolate and some smokey rauch malt. The ""bacon"" isnt very noticeable initially but it does grow stronger throughout the experience. Finish is pretty sweet with some dark roast, lingering on the palate long after the finish.

M - Big, full body with intense flavors and moderate carbonation. For being so big and flavorful it is still has a very smooth feel. This one is definitely a sipper but in a great way.

I had heard about this beer for months and was a bit cynical, but once I had it, I can only describe it as a rare experience. This pour was perfectly balanced with smokiness and a gorgeous tint of Maple that was not overpowering. Its chocolate notes were very apparent but not out of check. Its coffee notes were like a rich espresso. This is a beer that is unique and truly worth experiencing. It illuminates many unique possibilities that creative brewing can yield.","Florida, USA","pari6819"
151,"2012-03-12",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/30/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. Thanks to paulmpapp for bringing this to our tasting.

The pour is a fairly dark mahogany color that does not maintain in the edges. The corners are slightly transparent brown and ruby. 

There is a nice amount of smoked malt that fills up the nose. Sweet maple syrup comes through next, with roast coffee coming through at the end. The nose lives up to what this is supposed to be.

The flavor is sweet up front, with true maple syrup and dark roasted malts. The smoke comes through right away, filling up my nose and resting on the tongue. The malt has a good dark and roasted character that leads well into the coffee bitterness toward the end. The finish has more malt, and some sweet maple lingers into the coffee bitterness at the end.

If anything, the body feels a little light compared to the body. The robust flavors deserve a fuller beer. The carbonation is on the light side, and there is a moderate sweet stickiness that sticks on the lips after each sip. Even with the sweetness, the coffee really brings a dry and slightly acrid feel to it.

This is a great beer; the only thing that could really make it better would be a little bit more carbonation and a bigger body. I am definitely excited to see what the imperial version has to offer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Fantastic nose on this beer, great balance of maple and coffee roast.  The bacon/smoke is ever so subtle....really wish I could give this aroma 11/10 pts.  Taste deviates a little from the nose in that black coffee is the more prominent theme of the beer as opposed to the maple.  There is still plenty of rich maple syrup though and some hints of smoke.  Medium body with some astringency from the coffee.  Really solid beer!  I thought this was more hyped based, but it ended up being one of my favorite of the day.

First off -- awesome growler. Slight but promising hiss when I open the top.  Pour is a deep brown, large bubbles from a vigorous pour mixing with a thin but dense head that rises up after it hits the glass. Aroma is an intense coffee with hints of brown sugar and smoke. Taste is terrific -- while still cold its a rich coffee with a chocolately finish and a touch of smoke. The maple comes out as it warms with a rich maple sugar element coming up in the finish and the coffee mellowing out to let some of the sweetness and just a touch of heat through. Mouthfeel is low carbonation (expected for the growler), but rich and verging on the edge of viscous. Supports the roasty coffee edge well. Smoke comes through more on the nose than on the tongue. When I finish the glass the aroma of maple and bacon persists... gotta clean this before moving on. Drinkability is phenomenal.","California, USA","jedwards"

the nose is amazing... light roasted coffee followed by a hint a sweetness and a tad of smoke.

the taste is amazing. all of the different aspects of the beer come through at different stages of the taste. First you get the coffee on the front/ initial taste. Then as it moves back in the mouth the maple sweetness takes over ( but not in an over powering way like a creme brulee) then after you swallow and breath a little but the smoke (savory bacon) hits the back of the throat!

151,"2011-07-04",4.1,"In short: The name says it all, and it is INTENSE.  And also inexplicably excellent.
How: 22oz bottle.  Early 2011 batch.  Hilarious label.  Consumed fresh approximately one week after it was bottled.  Bottle sent to me by hopscotch, thanks a lot Eric.
The look: Near black body topped by a persistent small beige head
In long: Intense nose (really INTENSE) that is like a grandma freshly baked sugar pie with your nose one inch away from the pie, a lot of maple syrup, a lot of smoked pull pork.  Oh man, I literally could smell my glass two feet away.  Not much of the advertised coffee on the nose though.  Taste follows suit with maple syrup, freshly baked homemade crusty sugar pie, smoked pork and then adds a sip of cold black coffee, notes of iced-tea, cigarette butt and a good amount of caramel fudge and chocolate fudge.  No hops presence whatsoever.  There is so much intense flavors to distract my palate that the sweetness didnt bother me at all.  Reading my description the beer sounds gross.  But in reality this was pretty damn good.  A successful exercise in excess.  This is an over-the-top beer that I wont soon forget, Im sure I would have a lot of great memories of beer if it didnt make me forget so much stuff.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Big time thanks to Nate who was able to land this after I failed with several attempts. 32oz ""Florida"" growler into a Matilda tulip...A dark brown, almost black pour. A very light tan head rises about half a finger but stays with a great cap, ok lacing...The aroma is star of this beer. Huge notes of freshly ground coffee, slightly roasted, bold. The finish brings about wonderfully subtle maple syrup. The sweetness breaks the coffee up nicely. Most maple syrup is used heavy handily, this is done right. One would almost want more but it would really become to sweet in my opinion. Slightly smokey as well, but bothers me as I cant help but ask where is the bacon?...The taste is almost as good, but doesnt quite carry the weight on the nose. Coffee again is the main player, comes across more roasted now, but still freshly brewed. Sweet finish again, a hint of smoke. Basically, the nose, just not as good...Mouthfeel is ok, good carbonation, but the body is too light, not much of a finish...Easy to drink!

This is really good, and close to being world class. The name throws me the most and without the bacon reference I would have probably rated higher as going in I was expecting more smoke or some salty pork so I feel a little let down, if thats possible. I would certainly drink this again and recommend it highly. Just forget the name going in.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

Wow, the aroma of this beer is ridiculous! Slightly roasty and smokey with a blast of chocolate/mocha/espresso. Not burnt or acrid smelling at all with lots of luscious chocolate, roasted espresso bean and sweet maple syrup. Kind of smells like a Southern Tier dessert beer.

Medium bodied with a smooth silky roasted chocolate mocha espresso flavor. Very well balanced with the perfect roasted character, sweet malt and maple. Thankfully the coffee presence is prominent without being overly acrid or tasting like used coffee grinds. Lots of silky, luscious milk and bittersweet chocolate flavor as well as some slight smokiness and sweet maple. With bacon in the name I was expecting this beer to be more robust, smokey and burnt tasting but its just a touch and a very nice compliment to the sweeter flavors. No noticeable alcohol heat making this smooth beer very quaffable.

Nose: iced coffee. Roasted, then dry and crumbly  instant coffee never smelled so good. Fudgy underneath with bricks of pure black cacao laden chunks. Intense. Coffee ice cream. Concentrated maple syrup, cold if you please. Smoky in the back with an oily bacony essence.

Palate: interesting and weird all at the same time; different than the nose. Iced instant coffee spirals into black fudge into oily smoky meaty greasy bacon. Dries mouth from first quaff to last. Applewood smoked bacon slathered in maple. Dark pitted fruits underneath  prunes. Smoke weaves in and out. Grows a tart meaty lactic tang in the middle, subtle and faint. Maple coats everything.

151,"2011-02-13",4.4,"Bottle acquired via trade with darkguardian...thanks, my friend!!!  Shared this with family during the Super Bowl and my dad and brother-in-law talked about it about as much as the game!!!  Extremely fragrant aroma that filled the air with pungent Mrs. Butterworth maple syrup, freshly brewed Starbucks coffee, vanilla, and Nestle Quik.  Flavor is robust with pounds of Godiva chocolate, dark molasses, sweet toffee, and maple syrup-topped Belgian waffles.  Very reminiscent of Sees Candies Bordeauxs (milk chocolate filled maple bar with sprinkles).  Rich and creamy.  Was shocked to find this one weighing in at only 6.3% ABV.  Usually hard to pack that level of flavor and complexity into a smaller package.  So well done!!!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
151,"2011-02-12",4.1,"From growler, huge thanks to señor Plovmand. Black colour, light brown medium creamish head. Lots of chocolate and coffee in the aroma along with roasted malt, some smoke and dark fruit. Good filling mouthfeel. Very pleasant sweet flavour of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, bit smoke. Long lasting roasted maltiness chocolate finish. Great brew indeed!","FAROE ISLANDS","faroeviking"

151,"2011-02-02",3.5,"Tap. Heavy coffee and molasses aromas for the malt, light resin for the hops, moderate dough for the yeast with cola, tobacco, a big hit of maple syrup and lots of dark dried fruit in the background.  Head is large, creamy, tan with fair lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is almost black. Flavor starts moderately to heavily sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and acidic, and lightly to moderately bitter.  Palate is on the fuller side of medium, creamy with a lively carbonation and finishes a little dry. An interesting  Sweet Stout with plenty of good attributes but the large amount of maple syrup blows it all away.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

In fact the mob was actually chanting maple!!  bacon!!  Mohago pour with very little head.  Outrageous maple nose.  A little thin in the body, but the taste is fantastic with maple syrup, caramel malt, sweet coffee, and vanilla dominating the palate...","Florida, USA","50belair"

The aroma is nice and yum with rich coffee and a little bit of vanilla mixing with roasted to dark roasted malts. The taste is thin but rich with coffee, burnt malts, maple, more coffee and toward caramel maple syrup. It is almost tart with the degree and level of dark to burnt malts and coffee that are attained.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
151,"2011-01-18",4.1,"Thanks to hopscotch for bringing this one to the So Long Sea Bass Tasting.  Pours dark brown with a white head.  Nose is chocolate, maple, smoke, some roast, and slight coffee.  Flavor is similar with a balanced blend of all the promised flavors.  Very well done.  Would love to try this without the smokiness of the bacon.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

Everything is in the there perfectly.  I wish I could find a fault in this, but I cant.  Excellent brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
151,"2011-01-17",4.4,"Growler @ Seabass going away party, Jan15th 11. Courtesy of jdubfl.
Que dire de cette bière? tout simplement fantastique et reste une des meilleures de la nuit, loin devant certains grands noms de cette soirée.
De couleur brune foncée, léger col beige.
Arôme est fantastique, café est partout donnant des notes de moka, café au lait, malt grillé à souhait. Sans oublier le sirop dérable qui est appréciable.
En bouche, chacunes des gorgées donnent quasi une forme orgasmique à cette bière.  Tout y est subtilement bien arrangé, allant du sirop dérable qui est bien plus présent, le bacon donne une fine note de fumé, et de café. Je nai pas non plus noté le thé qui est utiliser dans cette bière.
Jarrête là car il est difficile de faire justice à cette bière simplement avec cette description. Je suggère donc de la déguster.

Seule bémol, je nai pas trouver trop de présence du bacon. Ceci étant dit, cette bière demeure une perle de dégustation venant de cette nouvelle micro-brasserie en Floride.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

151,"2010-11-28",4.4,"Growler from Dosbeerigos. Poured a darkish brown almost black with tiny white head. Aroma was maple syrup and roasted coffee. Taste was coffee and pancakes with maple syrup followed by a mild roastiness. Nice body. This stuff was amazingly delicious.

151,"2010-11-27",4.2,"Growler shared by JoeTheYounger. Rating #7. Another very dark brown porter, really pretty to look at. Big ashy coffee aroma, very roasty and it socks you right on the nose in a very pleasant way though. Nice light sweetness, maple is there for sure, but just as a nice compliment to everything else going on in there. Nice roasted flavor as well and maybe a hint of chocolate.

Tons of roasted coffee, with vannila and maple sweetness.  I couldnt find any bacon in here but thats quite alright.  I like this better than the regular espresso porter, well done.","USA","Slimbrundage"
151,"2010-10-22",4.5,"On draft at Funky Buddha for a small get together/tasting. Thanks to Kevin for pouring us some  of this. What an amazing beer!! It reminded me a lot of coffee ice cream I use to  have as a kid. It had a large amount of coffee and maple flavor mixed in with a wee bit of bacon. I also got a good amount of dark chocolate as well. I could definitely wake up in the morning and pour some of this. Great job Funky Buddha!!",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
151,"2010-10-20",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2010 (Updated rating)... This beer rocks!... The second batch has more maple syrup and smoky bacon in the flavor. The nose is even more luxuriant. Very nice tweaks, guys! World class coffee porter!


(Original rating = 3.9) Draft South Florida Throwdown 2010  Muddy, dark brown ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Decent retention. The nose is a fusion of Cuban espresso, maple syrup and dark chocolate with a whisper of smoke. Medium to full-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor presents sweet and acrid espresso up front; mocha and light acidity on the backside. Coarse, mocha, dry finish. Sample provided by hankchinaski!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
151,"2010-10-19",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2011 I had this beer courtesy of Kevin from the Funky Buddha, at the tasting I went to on Sunday. This was an experimental batch of the Piiti Porter. The beer was aged on a breakfast coffee that has hints of Bacon, Maple Syrup, and Strong Coffee.
Now I love the standard Piiti Porter, but hot damn this beer is amazing! Honestly, if breakfast in a beer is possible, I think it has finally been accomplished. The guys at the Funky buddha brought home the bacon (pun intended) with this beer.
The upfront taste was one of a standard coffee porter, then the maple syrup flavor comes in, and the leads back to coffee on the finish. Looking for the bacon was a challenge, and it mainly comes across in the nose.
Simply put, This is what breakfast beers should be!

If you are in the area jump on this soon, as from what I understand there is about 10 gallons total. Depending on the response they will brew it again. I have my fingers crossed that they do brew it again!","Florida, USA","dosbeerigos"
151,"2010-10-18",4.2,"Pours a near black with a small tan head. Nose is tons of maple syrup and nice coffee grinds. Maybe a slight whiff of smoke but thats it for the ""bacon"". The flavor is by far the best version of the Piti that I have had. Full and rich up front with a huge amount of maple flavor and a nice full body finishing with light creamy roastiness. This coffee really worked well for this beer. A stellar brew by the Buddha.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
