2273,"2017-02-02",5.0,"Quand jai vu cette bouteille sur son étagère, là-bas tout en haut, jai su immédiatement que ce serait
ma 1000ème belge sur ratebeer !! Il y a des intuitions fulgurantes .. Et surtout je restais figé sur
la bouteille sans pouvoir bouger .. Puis jai tendu le bras et je lai regardée longuement ...
La dame de ce magasin était émue de me voir ainsi ému !! Elle semblait dailleurs approuver mon 
choix, sans savoir jusquoù cela me mènerait .. Mais à chacun son job !!
Je suis allé annoncer la bonne nouvelle à ma bouteille en cave ce jour de Chandeleur 2017 
""Je tavais promis ma belle que tu serais ma 1000ème belge, le moment est venu de sortir de ton hibernation .. Réveille-toi calmement, nous allons faire un bout de chemin ensemble ce soir.
Je sais que tu pouvais encore attendre exactement 2 ans, voire plus si jétais distrait, mais cest aujourdhui le grand jour ..""
Sans discussion aucune, elle sest réveillée et a mis sa plus belle robe pour la fête.
Il faut dire quelle a de la bouteille cette bière (sans jeu de mots), puisque sa recette de base date de 
1946, et se trouve être rien moins quun emblème de la quadruple en Belgique, bien sûr, mais partout dans le monde .. Elle est saluée unanimement par la critique des vrais connaisseurs de fermentation haute riche et savoureuse, les amoureux de la quad qui savent que ce style est prodigieux 
Restons quelques instants, si vous me permettez, sur cette bouteille...
Le moine jovial qui y figure a fait lobjet jadis de moqueries, qui parlait dun art un peu naïf, voire
légèrement caricatural de la vie monastique. ""Mais pourquoi, diable, disait le moine, devrions-nous
être des figures tristes et empreintes de gravité ?? Nous sommes des humains à part entière, nous aimons la vie plus que tout, et nous voulons faire partager aux hommes de belles choses .. Lorsque
vous présentez quelque chose de la meilleure qualité à votre prochain, vous nêtes pas triste mais
vous riez de bon cur .."" Fin de la citation de notre moine, qui sextasie devant son verre.
Et je suis tout à fait prêt à mextasier comme lui, puisque cela fait intégralement partie de la méditation qui est une activité hautement religieuse  Nous nous éloignons ? Que non point....
Nous sommes en plein dans le sujet parce que sans méditation en dégustant cette bière, point de salut .. Elle exige strictement léveil complet des sens pour être capable de capter ses moindres 
subtilités qui sont du domaine du divin !! Et nous savons par expérience que le divin nest pas
facile à capter, et ne se présente pas à chacun au coin de la rue .. 
Donc je vous demanderai un minimum de concentration en abordant cette belle qui a tellement à 
vous dire .. Mais il ne faut pas la brusquer, il faut la prendre précautionneusement, lui parler, et lui
demander poliment de vous ouvrir les portes célestes .. Dans ce cas, ce que vous lui donnez vous 
sera rendu au centuple !!
Pour laccueillir au sortir de sa bouteille, je lui ai prévu un verre de St Sixtus, par ironie envers
lhistoire sans doute .. Ceux qui savent comprendront, et les autres auront la gentillesse de faire la
lecture dun historique de St Bernardus 
Rappelons quand même, avant de la verser que la recette de base de 10,5 % abv sest muée en 11 % en passant 6 mois en fût de chêne de Calvados.. Permettez-moi de vous signaler que ce choix de fût est loin dêtre fréquent, et que nous
trouvons ce choix des plus judicieux .. Mais nous vous laissons libres dapprouver !!
Il est temps de verser ce précieux breuvage, que dis-je nectar, dans notre verre.
Quelle splendeur céleste !! quelle divine mousse !! quel beauté étrange parmi les chérubins !!
Couleur auburn profond, à la clarté nette, et bordeaux vif en transparence.
Bulles fines, par milliers, partout, très vives. Un véritable festival sur lîle de Wight ..
Mousse beige crème, très épaisse, crémeuse, avec des cratères en haut, stable à 9 mm. Une beauté farouche, et quand je te vois, je ne louche pas, mais je tadmire longuement 
Arômes de malt dune richesse prodigieuse, du fût, du calvados beau, délicat, nuancé, stylé.
1ère bouche veloutée sur un malt profond, du fût de chai, et une pointe de tabac brun.
Arrière-bouche qui saffirme lentement, en vous chauffant le palais.
2ème où on est parti .. La machine est lancée telle une fusée interplanétaire .. La 1ère bouche était
la mise à feu, ici on a déjà lâché les boosters. Cest magnifique.
Tout y est déjà .. texture, profondeur, équilibre, richesse des saveurs .. Du très grand art.
3ème qui passe à la propulsion.. Vous sortez de vos gonds pour vous élever calmement dans les airs,
comme au ralenti, mais vous êtes bien partis !! ça cale ferme dans le dossier !!
Les malts sont superbes, les nuances de fruits mûrs sont délicates, en rapport strictement à lépicerie
fine .. Pour les âmes sensibles, il va falloir saccrocher !!
La longueur vous envoie en effet plusieurs G dans le paletot, avec une régularité telle que même David finirait par avoir peur de Goliath .. si je me fais comprendre.
Mais que ces G font du bien, quand on est amateur de belles choses.
A propos de belles choses, si vous regardez par le hublot, vous commencez déjà à voir la Terre qui
rétrécit .. vous commencez à aborder les grands espaces, la très haute altitude et votre monde vous
paraît tout petit là en bas !!! Je vous avais averti que côtoyer les chérubins nest pas donné au premier venu, mais plutôt au fils de lhomme venu de lespace, parce que lorsque vous vous rendez
compte de la petitesse du monde, vous êtes comme on dit chez les jeunes, un peu ""largués"" 
Donc accrochez-vous au bastingage, regardez comme la planète est belle et le nectar voluptueux !!
Quelle texture extraordinaire, quelles saveurs dun autre monde, quel équilibre (attention, ne vous
penchez pas trop !!), quelles harmonies dans les grandes orgues (les tuyaux du Père céleste).
Le Père lui-même vous accompagne, parce quil connaît bien lui le produit  (et dailleurs tous les produits, par conscience professionnelle),  mais surtout celui-là, je lui ai demandé au creux de loreille !! et il ma dit ""Corky, thats the best choice .."" Je lui ai dit ""mais mon Père, pourquoi parlez-vous anglais tout dun coup ?"", et il ma sagement répondu ""mais mon fils, parce que ce nectar est 
strictement mondial, voire universel"" .. Bien sûr, je nai pas pu contredire pareille sagesse !!
Pourquoi et comment après cela parler de questions purement techniques comme la levure ou lalcool, ou les jambes .. Tout cela est ici placé à la 100ème puissance ..
A propos, je constate que lon sélève encore, on approche de la mise sur orbite ..
OOOh, mais cest vraiment tout petit en bas maintenant, mais quest-ce que cest beau !!
Une planète bleue, cest quand même exceptionnel .. Je me dis quelle doit être bien fragile, avec 
cette couleur, et juste une petite bande très mince datmosphère pour respirer .. 
La finale est une béatitude parfaite.
CONCLUSION : protégeons-là notre planète, pour que des bières comme celle-ci puissent encore
longtemps y mûrir, se développer, ""sélever"" comme on dit pour le vin, ""saffiner"" comme on dit
pour les beaux fromages. Toutes ces notions sont ici portées à leur maximum.
Une bière élevée, affinée, strictement divine .. Dailleurs, pourquoi le moine rirait-il de si bon cur ? Vous avez compris que les chiffres ici ne veulent rien dire du tout .. Quest-ce quun minuscule 5 pour une bière aussi majuscule ?? Nous sommes dans la stratosphère de la bière, 
de la quadruple, et un petit 777 sur 100 lui conviendrait bien, puisque nous sommes au 7ème ciel !!
Merci ma belle... 1000ème belge.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

2273,"2016-12-28",3.4,"Has a hazelnut brown color with a froth, white head.

Smells of toasty malts, soaked up by boozy apples, balanced by sweet raisins and rock sugar. Apart from that the nose is pretty muted, not much going on here.

Has a lower carbonation among a spicy, heavier bodied beer, in which the barrel only adds a subtle note to the flavors, while the mouthfeel maintains thin.

Tastes of sugary malts, licorice, dry and boozy apple, which opens up the palate to an even more pronounced sweetness. Brings cloves, cardamom and allspice to the tongue, as well as a watery, thin mouthfeel. Has an even spicier finish, due to the warming barrel, which lends a late apple fruitiness to the taste with a pleasant dryness to it.

The barrel composes a pleasantly distractive fruit dryness, which adds complexity to the otherwise plain and sweet sugary spices of the base beer. Not sure if this is better than the regular version, it may be too different to my palate to compare. Despite the barrel and the higher abv the beer lacks complexity and has an off-putting thin mouthfeel.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2273,"2016-07-15",4.6,"The beer was packaged in a traditional wire caged bomber, and the cork came off with a loud pop. Its been a while since I have had the regular version of St. Bernardus Abt 12 (a shame I know), but based on my recollection of it, this version looked a little lighter, and formed a larger head. The head stayed around for a long while too. The aroma was sweet, showing off the brandy casks that this beer was aged in. There were notes of apple, pear, toffee, and honey on the nose. The taste was much lighter than the standard version of the beer, as the aging seemed to have suppressed the dark fruits that are so prominent in the initial brew, and replaced them with vinous and berry flavors. There was some vanilla and brown sugar in the flavor too, but not as prominent as I have found in bourbon barrel aged beers. The body of the beer was very silky and airy, and the finish very smooth. This was quite easy to drink considering the high ABV, complex aging process, and rich history.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Brown coloured body, with deep red hues where light hits it. Clear and transparent. One finger of light beige head, a bit frothy, with average retention, eventually leaving a thick film covering surface, after it has collapsed.
Aroma of caramel, dark fruits, apples, light molasses, dates,pleasant alcohol notes.
Taste has caramel, malts, dates, raisins, hints of alcohol every now and then but for the most past the alcohol is well hidden, sugars, plums, apples, light metallic notes on the finish.
Medium thick body, carbonation on the high side, smooth and creamy on the palate.
Very good, just a little bit better than the original in my opinion but in the long term Id go back to the non oak-aged Abt 12 more often than this one.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"

Its full-bodied, warming and very smooth on the palate, with flavors of dried fruits and apple dominating. Some booze too, and a spiced, woody hint and caramel. Lasting finish with apples, caramel, booze and lots of raisins and prunes. Its a fine brew indeed, but theres too much calvados influence I think, even though I like calvados.

No detectable oak character. Calvados character is there by power of suggestion (I could be convinced that it a fermentation byproduct). Flavors are rich, malty, musty.

2273,"2015-11-10",3.4,"Half year old bottle from the cellar, opens with a loud bang but no gushing. Medium, pale yellowish beige, irregular head breaking open in instants, but retaining on the edges and in thin islands of foam over the liquids surface. Colour is an initially clear, deep and warm, autumn-like mahogany brown, dark but translucent. Rich aroma of a lot of calvados (a tad too much to my liking actually), candied cherries, caramel candy, brown candi sugar, overripe pear, dry earth, blue plum, hay, hints of oxidized madera, amaretto, vanilla-like oak wood, cinnamon rolls, fresh ginger, some glue-like phenols in the background. Sweet onset, spritzy to the extent of being almost cava-like and in that sense clearly overcarbonated for the style, candied dates and raisins, some dry banana, maple syrupy sweetness lingering, supple and bit oily body, seemingly (strangely) thinner than the original; caramelly malts with a nutty edge, becoming toastedly bitterish in the end, earthy and leafy hop bitterishness, retronasal oxidation, drying woody tannins and, more than anything else, an unmistakable presence of calvados-like alcohol, with both the sweetish apple flavour and the drying burn, making the finish a bit astringent and even numbing the tongue a bit well before that. However great the basic beer may be, I find this a bit over the top: too much of the calvados for sure, interfering too much with the delicate balance of flavours of the regular Sint-Bernardus Abt and imposing itself in the end in the form of liquor-like astringency to a fairly high degree (as in: lowering drinkability - in combination with the overcarbonation, I even found this quite hard to pour down in the end). Alcohol as such is not softened with age (at least not in a bottle), so I dont think ageing this would decrease this effect, which did bother me a bit. Interesting addition to this respected brewerys range though, and certainly suitable as a slow sipper in small quantities on a cold evening, after a good meal, with some abbey cheese.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2273,"2015-10-15",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2015 75cl bottle, shared with friends at home (9 X 2015). Acknowledged as one of the best beers in the world, now matured in oak calvados barrels for six months. This oak aged barrel beer pours a beautiful chesnut, red, brown coloured brew in a little snifter. The head is almost not existing. The nose is rather subtle, with vanilla and even minth features. I noticed some raisin notes too. The taste is very spiritful, with a ending rich of alcohol (although I could not really pinpoint the calvados taste). But the mouthfeel is surprisingly disappointing: Where is the complexity gone? This abt lacks the fullness, the richness in flavours. The malts, yeast, sugar, nuts, caramel, raisins are far too subtle.

The flavor follows with sweet toffee, toasted caramel, dates, and raisins while the vanilla and oak smooth things out and add depth to the flavor profile.

2273,"2015-07-26",4.1,"750ml bottle picked up in Brussels. As a fan of St Bernardus, abt quads and barrel-ageing I was excited to shell out for this once-off release (or so I hear). 

Pours the same as your typical ABT 12 - no difference there. 

The aroma is far fruitier than the standard - less of the slightly 'soapy' taste it has from time to time. The quad flavours mix with the apple, pear and brandy from the barrels along with the standard dark fruit blend. 

In taste, the barrel brings a new fruitier edge to the beer. There's sweetness, but less of the heavier brown sugar tastes than before. The aftertaste is of fruity, strong aperitif. A touch rakija with Christmas dinner. Not one of the more smooth or intensely heavy barrel flavours you get from De Molen or De Struise. 

The mouth is the low carbonation taste of before. ABT 12 typically has the most amazing mouthfeel (which is one of its closest resemblances to Westveleteren on its day), but I'm not getting it at its fullest (however, I've had the ABT 12 enough times to know that it changes from time to time too). 

Overall - a nice touch to the flavour, but probably a bit resource intensive (ie €€€) to justify doing it all the time. Perhaps it could take a leaf out of the book of La Trappe and experiment with different barrels batch-to-batch. One for the fans. Satisfied (it's already one of my favourite beers), but won't need to buy again, at least not from this barrel.

Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, pepper, clove, light vanilla, oak, and yeast/oaky earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, pepper, clove, light vanilla, oak, and yeast/oaky earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, pepper, clove, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible oak aged quadrupel style.

2273,"2015-07-11",4.3,"This is just an excellent beer that tastes markedly different from the normal St. Bernardus. There is a more toasty, slight apple note going on in the nose and taste than the normal stuff which seems to mute the grape-drink/bubblegum aspect normally in the standard Bernardus quad. My criticisms are the somewhat overwhelming wood/leather component. I wonder if that dies down with some age? I like the calvados brandy note, but less so the oak and also less so the $24 price tag. This is unique enough to justify the price one time, but it is not doubly as good as a Abt 12 although it is slightly more ambitious and complex.","Wisconsin, USA","SWZA"
2273,"2015-07-06",4.5,"From the corked, caged 750 ml. bottle. Review #2,500 for me. The pour is really handsome with its chestnut-mahogany color and the red hues all around. It builds up to a lingering and delicate off-white colored head. The aroma has a sweet Belgian malt character along with dark fruits but the oak barrel aging is really noticeable here. It reminds me of something pulled out of dank, dark, 55 degree cellar. Compared to the original ABT 12 this does not smell quite as sweet. A bold body that is also smooth and velvety. The taste mirrors what I am used to in the original ABT 12 with a vibrant Belgian sweet and roasted malt character, raisins, dark fruit, and modest hop profile. The bitterness still lingers at the finish. I do not pick up as much of the mustiness in the taste as I did on the nose. Just a tremendous beer but I still prefer the original to it. Is it worth $30 a bottle? I am not sure about that. But I had to have it once and because of the price I probably will not have it again. Ill stick to the original.

2273,"2015-05-29",4.2,"750 cc from Whole Foods PM. Pours hazy rusty brown with frothym off-white head. Nose is oak, vinous fruit, berries, earthy malt. Tastes earthy malty, with some oak, prune, nuts, vinous fruit, and berry flavors. Complex finish, even some mild rauch and late hops. Good stuff.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2273,"2015-05-15",3.7,"bedankt @Douberd voor het regel van deze fles voor me tijdens #UBF15. schenkt caramel bruin in, licht helder met matige kraag, overigens valt het mij op dat er vrij veel co2 tijdens het schenken voorkomt. Aroma van rozijn, iets van rode wijn, donker en overrijp fruit, alcohol, bruine suiker. Smaken; gelijk die mond vullende co2, dat had van mij wel wat minder gemogen, redelijk bruine suiker zoet, donker fruit, rozijn, banaan, gist, wijn (calvados), matige tot redelijke body, naast de te hoge co2 vind ik ook de Barrel Aging van de Calvados iets te beperkt aanwezig, Het lag hem denk ik aan mijn verwachting, maar ik had er toch iets meer van verwacht. ondanks dat zeker geen slecht bier.","Leeuwarden, NETHERLANDS","ShivanDragon"
2273,"2015-05-11",3.8,"Corked bottle. Dark brown color. Malt, caramel, apple and calvados in the aroma. Malty sweet flavor, caramelly. Roast, aple, oak, calvados. Sightly alcoholic. I very much doubt if calvados barrels are most suited for oak aging this beer. Nevertheless a pleasure to drink.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
2273,"2015-05-10",3.9,"75cl bottle shared at home. Dark mahogany with a small off-white head. full body with low carbonation. Quite sweet with some bitter tones.

2273,"2015-05-02",3.9,"Bottle at the Ibis Brussels tasting. It pours deep brown with a thick beige head. The nose is rich, juicy, plenty of dried fruits, big woody vanilla, stewed apple, toffee apple, fruit cake and a touch of spearmint. The taste is smooth, toasty, roasted malts, vanilla, dark fruits, wood, spice, light candy sugar, touch of charred wood and some alcohol boost with a pretty dry finish. Full body and moderate carbonation. Obviously not as good as base beer, but still a hell of a beverage.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
2273,"2015-04-28",3.1,"small bottle sample from a kind soul at ZBF 15, poured a cloudy light brown colour with a tanned head. i was looking forward to this one. oak aged abt 12 this could never go wrong right? nose of caramel malts, belgian yeast, red fruits, apples, alcohol warmth, oak notice, strong spicy alcoholic finish,brown sugar, definitly a calvados oak notice, but the complexity of the base beeris completely lost imo. sour apples, rubber, some chemical acetone or something?, i heard some people that this would get better after a year or something.. well IMO this base beer doesnt deserves a oak aged spirit version. they shouldnt listen to the hype. the base beer as allready perfect. and cant get any better. this is a complete disappointment.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"

2273,"2015-04-16",3.9,"Pours clear, dark amber to rather light brown - for the style- . Smell is yeasty. Fruits, as well as a hint of bitter. Taste is grainy, bit of alcohol warmth, some oak and some spirit-side to it that is rather hidden. Very mellow, very blanced. Creamy mouthfeel and perfect carbo. Bit of mild booze in the finish, but not too much. I liked it","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
2273,"2015-04-05",4.0,"The abt is simply a great beer. Hints of calvados and booze added by the BA, very subtle soureness too. Mabye i poured it a little too cold, but i feel it is not really adding much to the original one, but rather overtaking the chocolaty, sweet notes of the original abt. Definitely not bad though. Must see how this does after a year or so in the cellar.","BELGIUM","WaW"

2273,"2015-03-30",3.8,"Butelka 75cl. 
OCZY : piwo pomimo leżakowania jest wciąż zamglone i nieprzejrzyste. Kolor piwa jest brązowy z czerwonymi odcieniami. Piana jest spora i bardzo trwała. 

NOS : piwo ma aromat czerwonych, kandyzowanych i suszonych owoców. Do tego tarta, gotowane wiśnie i jabłka, goździki, gałka muszkatowa, cynamon i anyż. W aromacie jest wyczuwalny alkohol na styl whisky. Drewno i calvados na granicy autosugestii choć w porównaniu ze zwykłą wersją jest więcej ciekawych różnic jak choćby nuty przypominające jabłko i niedojrzały agrest. Ogólnie jest bardzo owocowo i bogato. 

USTA : piwo jest za bardzo gazowane i muszę go wygazować by nie pieniło mi się w gardle. Konsystencja taka sama co wersja podstawowa : kremowa i średnio gęsta. 
Słodkie i choć alkohol jest już dobrze ułożony to trudno o nim zapomnieć. Piwo można by porównać do tarty owocowej zagryzionej winogronami Muskat, popijanej whisky i jeszcze raz zagryzionej cukierkami anyżowymi. W smaku ingerencja beczek po Calvados dodaje nut w stylu whisky co z kolei pogłębia smak i wydłuża/utrwala posmak tego piwa. 

ODCZUCIA : przyznam się, że spodziewałem się więcej ""wow"" ale ewidentnie piwo jest za młode. To znaczy leżakowanie nie odjęło nic temu już bardzo bogatemu piwu. Dodało więcej głębi i subtelności choć chciałoby się czegoś więcej. Po wygazowaniu i ociepleniu jest o wiele lepiej. Oczywiście polecam leżakować to piwo jeszcze dłużej.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"
2273,"2015-03-28",3.8,"Bottled. Pours brown with an average, lasting beige head. Aroma of dried fruits, caramel, wood and vanilla notes. Sweet flavor that ends up slightly more dry with alcohol notes. Medium to full bodied, oily texture and soft carbonation. A very nice Quad.","Tranbjerg, DENMARK, DENMARK","Habanero"
2273,"2015-03-11",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2015 Hazy deep red-brown colored beer with a one finger high beige head. 

Nose: Nuts, dark syrup, chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, banana and whipped cream. 
Taste: Sweet malt, brown sugar, dried fruit, yeast, oak, caramel, cherry and cognac. 
Body: Full body with a great, crisp, carbonation. So beatiful, complex body. A light bitterness and sweetness works together.

2273,"2015-02-07",4.4,"Thanks! 750 ml. bottle sampled @ BBF 2014. St. Bernardus has been so far oddly reluctant with releasing this beer. A release was announced months ago & since the nothing. They only brought 6 bottles on the first day of BBF 2014, a beer festival expected to draw close to 20.000 people over two days this years, weird. Dark murky brown, little tanned head. Nose is light weird herbs, brown sugar, sweet, light soap, brown banana, Taste is mostly yeast, brown sugar sweet, lots of brown banana, lightly bitter herbal upfront, sweetish ,yeasty, brown sugar, only faint booze in the back, Med.
