2443,"2016-09-29",3.2,"Bottle shared at Puzzls. Poured a dead body gold, like thicker apple juice. Aroma was all over the place, bad apples, smoke, soap. Flavor is much better, smoked apples and camp fire pork skins. Medium mouthfeel with an average duration on the aftertaste.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
2443,"2015-12-31",3.8,"Backlog from Brony Bottle Share at Travlrs. Gold with small head. Tart apples with a light ash note coming through. Interesting.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","DCLawyer"
2443,"2015-12-30",3.8,"Bottle. Yellow copper pour, with no head. Smoke, toasted oak, sweet apples, booze, notes of honey, vanilla, and nice char barrel character. Interesting.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
2443,"2015-10-01",5.0,"This blew my mind! ABV is well disguised in this gently smoky (yet not underdone) treat! Glad it only comes out once a year because I spend a small fortune when it does.","","Craftbrewhaha"
2443,"2015-08-28",3.7,"Bottle - Light cooked Apple and bourbon.  Clear gold.  Sweet Apple and bourbon and a bit of booze in the finish.  A little syrupy.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2443,"2015-08-22",4.1,"Bottle from Schilling Cider House. Thanks to Eugene. Sadly appropriate beverage given all the fires raging in WA apple country. Really cool charred oak barrel character on this. Sweet and strong but kept well in check by the barrely parts. Smooth rich sipper. Pretty damned delicious.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
2443,"2015-08-21",4.2,"Finally got to try this. Solid light copper color, still. Nose is strong slick apple with wood alcohol, burnty wood, not smoke. Hefty alcohol balance the apple. Flavor is soft and heavy alcohol essence with apple. Whatever, I like. Reminiscent of ice cider.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2443,"2015-08-12",5.0,"An unbelievable barrel aged cider. Smokey, Peated, huge barrel character with tons of fresh apple flavor. Simply divine.","Seattle, Washington, USA","mages64"
2443,"2015-06-30",4.8,"This is masterful cidery. Its literally inbetween the Winterruption from JK and the Prohibition Rumrunner from Sea Cider Farms in BC. It comes as a deep clear gold and has fantastic handles. The oak is very noticable and runs a bit sweeter than the Prohibition - Ive never had a smoky cider but it definitely works here. I was very surprised and blown away by this. It was well worth the trip to Seattle to bring back to California!","California, USA","Cidertron"
2443,"2015-06-26",4.2,"Bottle at PIB 2015, pours a clear golden yellow with no head. Nose brings out vanilla, whiskey, and light honey. Flavour is really complex, with vanilla, whiskey, smoke, and green apples. So amazingly complex and cohesive. Fantastic stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2443,"2015-04-02",4.1,"Bottle.

Pours a rich yellow-orange into my glass, thick and viscous and almost without carbonation. Gentle smoke wraps around a sweet apple aroma augmented with banana. Flavor is sweet but not overpowering, rich apple with mouth-drying red apple skin tannins. Melding with all of this is a light and subtle smoky whisky character. A bit hot, but not unacceptably so. A beautiful drink, really really impressive.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2443,"2015-03-30",2.7,"[ bottle ][ 1oz ][ @DC tasting ][ ? ][ mini tumbler ][ 02.15.15 ]transparent gold, thin oily white cap. Sweet cider like nose, Apple sweetness, honey. Thin honey front palate, booze mid, light heat, light glue and booze.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
2443,"2015-02-18",3.5,"Some smoke in this and comes together pretty well for a cider. Some apple peel bitterness and sweet and sour finish. Bottle shared at tasting.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
2443,"2015-02-17",4.1,"Bottle at Brony Tasting, DC. 2014 bottle I found at Special Brews in Seattle. Clear, slight brown haze. Great aroma, soft smoke on terrific sharp apple. Light charcoal, subtle. Lovely light porkiness. Round soft whiskey, light aged bourbon. Very impressive, I love this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
2443,"2015-02-17",3.5,"Bottle at the DC Tasting. Clear light yellow. Aromas of apples, tart notes. Tastes of apples, tart fruit, spices. Medium body with a dry finish.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
2443,"2015-02-15",4.1,"Bottle at Brony Bottle Share courtesy of luttonm, thank you sir! Very slightly hazy golden yellow color, rare large bubble, legs. Aroma of apple must and flesh, distant campfire. Taste is lightly burning apple skins. Very tasty.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"

2443,"2013-11-30",4.3,"Decants rather flat into my tulip.. Off-orange pour with force pour bubbles but mostly still. Concentrated apple brandy aroma hits first, with a campfire smokiness in the slightest quantity.. perfect for balance and not overwhelming. Nose is of fall in a glass. Tannic up front with a bit of phenol from the smoke, but not a hindering quantity. Sweetness and smokiness here make perfect bedfellows. Skins and pith round out the savory/bitter element here in the finish.. Never have I tasted a big cider with this much balance. Those who dislike smoked ciders and beers will not like this, but as a fan, I think its friggin spectacular. Hope to find another bottle on my next trip to Seattle.","Portland, Oregon, USA","goodbyeohio"
2443,"2013-09-18",4.4,"375, corked and foiled and strung with a little sticker you can keep. Pours a burnished dark golden-amber with no head or lace or legs. Beautifully harmonious and balanced nose of sharp biting sour apples, sweet red and green apples, soft earthy whiskey notes, some vanilla and oak, and a tiny bit of honey, which I could totally be imagining from reading the description. Creamy light body, very much a dancer, moves gracefully but with presence. Sweet and tart apples play off smoke, earthy whiskey bite, and sweet tangy honey. Wonderful combinations constantly revealing themselves over the top of each other. Never had anything quite like it. Without a doubt, truly exceptional.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
