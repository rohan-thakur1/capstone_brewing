Aroma is a precisely mixed bananas and clean tropical fruit character you get with many premium sakes mixed with a Madeira-like dried fruits and nuts.  Flavor is ethereal with a delightful sweetness that never overpowers it.  Virtually no trace of the high ABV, save a slight warming of the throat.  Amazing stuff.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"

865,"2009-02-06",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2009 Bottle I brought back for the Dallas crew. My second Koshu, and much better than the first. Pours a clear, copper, whiskey hued body with a tsunami of strong twisting legs left on the glass by a swirl. Aroma is potent and complex with strong elements of burnt sesame seeds, cobwebs, must, smoked meats, hoisin, bitterness and maple. Taste is quite different. Very sweet and honey glazed up front with strong notes of madeira and sherry. Long, long duration with a nutty finish. Notes of raisins and maple. Quite the sipper with decently well hidden alcohol. A bit of umami on the mid palate. Syrupy and very balanced. A very complex and deep rice drink.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Special thanks to BMan1113VR for providing the bottle that made this possible. 

Pours a glowing orangey color. Nose is sesame seeds, teriyaki sauce, and unami, and those honey glazed sesame snacks. Sticky legs on the pour with highly active tears. Additional notes of snap peas, teriyaki glazed eel (unagi) and sweet brown rice. A great sake for pairing.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"

865,"2008-05-05",4.3,"30 cl bottle from Systembolaget. The label states that it has been matured for 7 years, reaching 16.6% ABV. Pours copper. Tremendous chocolate aroma with caramel and nuts as well as alcohol. Taste is more sherryish, but still very sweet. Nuts take over as well as grapes and hints of cellar. Slick and oily texture. Irresistible- what good have I done to deserve drinking this on a Monday evening?","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
865,"2007-10-16",3.6,"Bottle @ chris_os hotel room in Minneapolis: Copper color, nose of musty sweet honey and meadish.

865,"2004-03-30",4.2,"An odd sherry color, smokey, fig, brown rice, spicy, salt and soy, some pitted fruits, hitns of olive. This is a wild brew. More textural than a typical sake. Slightly more chewy. Thanks a bunch austinpowers!","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
865,"2004-03-28",4.3,"Bottle, thanks to Austinpowers.  Okay, this is my first sake experience other than a few random sips throughout life of probably-shitty brands, so bear with me here, as I will be rating it as per my beer standards.  WOW!!  I have to say, this is really expanding my horizons.  Amber and inviscid in the little white shot glass-thingy that it's served in.  Maple syrup is the primary thing that comes to mind here, with a touch of vinegar.  The texture is indeed more viscous than it looks in the glass, as per the commercial description.  Is that a hint of yeast in the aroma?  I think it might be.  Nice stuff, thanks to Scott for sending this to Joe!  this almost makes up for his massive legeing.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
865,"2004-03-15",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2004 Wow.  This is extremely sweet and sherry like, which is odd for a sake.  The aging resulted in a lot of flavor and character, much like an oloroso sherry or a light madeira.  It's not sweet or rich enough to be comparable to a port.  It's a touch grainy and thinnish, reminding you it's entirely made from rice, which is hard to believe.  The aroma is a touch candied and the color is again just like sherry.  Remarkable, given how much complexity Enoki Brewery has wrung from mere rice.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
