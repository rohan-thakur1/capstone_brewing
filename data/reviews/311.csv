311,"2017-05-16",4.8,"Tasted from can. Pours super juicy orange with white head. Aroma is big time tropical fruits. Papaya, mango, guava, melon, passion fruit along with some orange. Very well balanced. Flavors of tons of tropical fruits like the nose. Goes down super easy. Incredible imperial IPA.

311,"2017-04-28",4.5,"Hazy orange. Julius turned up to 11. Creamy orange meat and peel aroma and flavor. Not as deep as Tiles head to head but with a perfect creamy juicy mouthfeel thats hard to beat. A bit overhyped, yes, but damn good.
10,000th American beer - woohoo!!!","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
311,"2017-04-26",4.1,"16 ounce can. Pours a hazy pale gold with a nice white head. Aroma of citrus and tropical. I can taste just about every tropical fruit known in this beer. Just a bit of malt at the finish. Exceptional.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
311,"2017-04-21",4.2,"Poured from a 16 oz can. 
Aroma is very hop forward with lots of tropical fruit and citrus notes. Lots of mango, papaya, guava, melon, orange and tangerine. Light background malt notes with some cracker and biscuit. 
Pours a very hazy, dull, pale, golden hay with a medium small, thick, white head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers for a bit. Medium light lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with light cracker malt and biscuit notes. Lots of hop flavors with mango, papaya, guava, and other tropical fruit. Medium light citrus notes with some tangerine and mandarin. Medium light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really nice IPA. So much hop aroma and flavor.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
311,"2017-04-12",4.5,"Can from a trade. Poured into teku. Orange juice looking pour with a medium to large white head, tiny velvety bubbles. Strong citrus and pine nose, juicy, pulpy, a ton of hop aroma without being grassy. Taste follows, holy cow. Just a straight citrus hop punch in the face with a bubble finish from carbonation. Not much malt to get in the way, but supports the hops, hides the alcohol well. zesty. I really didnt think this was going to be up to the hype, but holy cow it is. a perfectly crafted hop explosion with everything to balance it. great beer.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
311,"2017-04-11",4.3,"April 2017 batch. Pours a murky, cloudy pale orange with a white lacing. The aroma is heavy citrus, more orange and papaya than grapefruit. The flavor is sweet wth a faint bitterness. Slightly chalky palate. Striking similarities to Julius. This is insanely good.","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
311,"2017-04-04",4.6,"Drove an hour in the snow to just barely snag one of the last three tall boy can allotments of this one. Worth it. Pours a very opaque, hazy, thick, dank orange-y color, almost like unfiltered mango juice. Strong floral and fruity aroma. Tastes strongly of hops, but still, as expected, juice-y. Like a good beer and fruit punch had a lovechild. Best served approximately 5-8 minutes after an enjoyable cuddle sesh with your booboo. Good. As. Hell.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"
311,"2016-12-08",4.1,"Can - slightly over 2 months. Aroma of mango, papaya, orange, pine, light alcohol. 
Pours out super hazy orange with a slightly off white head. 
Taste is better than the nose with tons of complex tropical fruits and a slight bubblegum character. Turns grassy mid-palate and finishes a bit pithy but still juicy. 
Lighter side of full bodied, soft mouthfeel, soft to average carbonation, pithy hoppy finish. This is an awesome DIPA but would be even better super fresh.","Aalborg, DENMARK","BrettGT"

311,"2016-10-06",3.5,"Pours a diarrhea colored rust/orange with a thick white head...yeah, not pretty even compared with most ""hazy NE IPAs"". Nose is very Tree House -- mango juice, orange juice, some kind of chalky yeast. Its ""soft"" in a way I find the big Tree House IPAs. Some hops, I guess, but theyre secondary to all the fruit juices. Mouth is massively juicy, as expected. Good in the sense that it really is a juice bomb and I suppose it does that effectively. Quite a lingering herbal bitterness on the end, which is a refreshing thing in an IPA! Maybe a tad better than King Julius, but not really my thing overall. My big concern is that brewers are actually adding fruit juice to the boil, which honestly I find disgusting. Not sure if thats the case here but its likely.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

311,"2016-09-27",4.1,"Canned 9/15/16, drunk 9/16/16.Strongly soupy body shows a blend of amber, bronze and gold. Well-retained, white head atop is large and fluffy.The nose reminds me exactly of Very Green (which reminds me more or less exactly of Green). That is to say, very lush, spicy and dank with lots of melon, lime and guava character. Did this side-by-side with the recent King Julius batch and it fared less expressive in the nose, overall, with just a touch of alcohol sharpness coming late. Very ""tight"" aroma, deep and dank and I dont doubt this will improve over the next 10 days, give or take. Malts, as always, show light honey, biscuit and are nicely attenuated, adding light juiciness to the already juicy hops.Bright and very hoppy in the flavor, with tons of the tell-tale Tree House watermelon-like juiciness. Limes, guava and lemon-grapefruit sharpen things slightly, though the body, of course, provides malt softness as the tight carbonation helps ease the hop bitterness, as well. Juicy, for sure, and very enjoyable, but again, cant help thinking this will get much better in about 7-10 days. Very dry, much higher attenuation than the first EBF batch.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
311,"2016-02-13",4.5,"Poured from a can into a tulip: Pours cloudy golden orange with a decent white head. Aroma of straight up tropical juice. Lots of mango, orange, other citrus fruit.
