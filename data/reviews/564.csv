564,"2016-10-06",3.9,"(Last) 500 ml bottle from the brewery (2013), sampled at cellar temperature from a Chouffe tulip. Still a fairly big pop as the cap comes off - good sign - and the pour is a beautiful creamy light tan mass of foam that tops a darkly translucent, almost opaque walnut body, leaving very thick chunks as it very slowly dissipates...aroma is a mixture of vinous, lightly tart and oxidized notes with the caramel-banana aspects of a dunkelweizen, along with some coffee and chocolate - lots of dark roastiness here...body is mostly sweet at the front with some light tingly spiciness, like cinnamon in coffee, roastiness growing towards a somewhat drier finish...low to medium warming alcohol presence throughout, body slightly on the thin side at this point, carbonation starting to disappear though theres still just enough to keep things pleasant. This was at its best fresh - the bottle I had a year later had gone downhill a bit, and the one last year was getting rather sour and off; strangely its improved for this last sample, which makes me wish that I had somehow managed to attain more than a four-pack.

In long: Timid nose of toasted bread, browned banana peels and mild phenolic notes. In mouth the beer has a medium body with a lively carbonation. Taste is not exciting. There is basic toasted bread with caramel spread. Yeasty notes. Some notes. Mild fruity notes of ripe bananas and figs. A light spiciness. This was a rather smooth beer that maybe suffered because it was served during a tasting where most beers were very intense.

Thanks to wnoble or tastybeer for sharing this over Labor Day weekend. It was a respectable anniversary ale with enough depth that it should last for a few years in the cellar. I look forward to sharing my own bottle with folks down the road. My only regret is not having the foresight to buy multiple when at the brewery.

Aroma / Appearance - An amber red base sticks around with an ivory head that is sticky and dense. Legs of sticky fluid sweep down the sides. Malts, sweet fruity aspects, and old hops hang in the air like the smell of damp rain.

Flavor / Palate - Caramel, malt, and warm alcohol stick in the throat with a mild heaviness. The beer itself feels fruity and sweet without being overwhelming. I actually thought of it more as an old ale than an abbey dubbel. That said it is worth trying if you happen to run across a bottle. Then again, when is a new release from Dan not worth sampling at least once?","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

564,"2013-06-28",3.4,"500mL Bottle. Hot banana and bubblegum nose. Spicy yeasts start and prickly and warm palate, with bananas foster, cooked cream, and heavily boozed fruitcake. I want to like this, but I cant get there. The Belgian yeast just aint right. It leaves a slightly biting, kind of harsh phenolic sensation. Way too warm. Definitely needs to settle a little bit. Maybe its just too green, but it certainly isnt that stellar of an example of the style now. I appreciate the dryness and the juicyfruit finish, but the front end of the palate is heavy on harsh phenols and overly fruit esters that put what should be a more delicate malt structure out of balance. It does manage a graceful, really textured finish with juiciness, malt brownness and the right nip of sugar. Too bad about the phenols up front.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Medium-full body; lively, fine-bubbled carbonation; excellent texture (up there with the dialed-in Belgians), with slight roughness from white pepper and cloves at the forefront; overall, though, very much a generous, layered dubbel-like beer: dried fruits, nice caramelization, none of that cola-focused nonsense one often gets from U.S. renditions; dialing back those phenols at the front would let the rounder elements open up a bit more, but this is nice as is.

Aromas offer fruity esters, banana bread, and toasty malts. Carmelized, some brown sugar, toffee, and touches of dried fruit. Esters and yeast show some strength as it warms, bready and biscuity, sweeter touches of vanilla, firm esters, banana bread, a touch of cocoa.

Body lets up more as we start moving on. Biscuits, toffee, and toast. A waft of cocoa, vanilla, spice. Firm and fuller body offers more fruit into the middle.

Pretty well done, very fruity as you move into the middle and backend. Pretty solid offering, better spice and yeast, some heat on the backend with some dryness make this a bit more interesting. Front and middle and sweeter, richer estery fruit presence and thicker chewy malt presence. Backend makes this solid though. Nose is more fruity. Beer looks great. Nice. Where its not my favorite style or suited to my personal tastes, its pretty well done. Cheers to 20 years!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
564,"2013-06-08",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a deep dark mahogany brown with a foamy off white head that leaves plenty of lacing.  Aromas of dark fruits, bananas, candied sugar, and caramel malts. Taste is similar with spice from the yeast and some nice dry herbal bitterness. Not quite usually my thing, but this was a very well produced Dubbel.","Menasha Red Light District, Wisconsin, USA","backdaft"
564,"2013-06-07",3.6,"Bottle from Casanovas, dark ruby brown pour with a decent white head. Aroma of bananas, dark fruit and a lot of yeast. Taste is tons of yeast, slight clove and some dark fruit, tingly mouth feel.

564,"2013-06-01",3.9,"From bottle at Davis BeerFest. Pours reddish brown with a nice beige head and a candi sugar aroma. There is a carbonated dark malt flavor with some plum, candi sugar and a bitter finish. A nice dubbel.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
564,"2013-05-31",3.6,"500ml bottle from Discount in Waukesha. Pours a faintly reddish brown with a foamy brownish-white head leaving a lot of lacing. Aroma has spicy yeast, banana, sweet malts and fruits & nuts. Taste is of strong spiciness, sweet caramel, cloves, heavy brown sugar. Yeasty and sweet, quite thick and dry. Some alcohol presence. Finishes sweetly spicy with some length. Interesting take on whatever style this is. Seems that it would age well - may have to find another.","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
564,"2013-05-30",3.5,"Bottle from Casanova Liquors.  I didnt like this one as much as others did.  Had a bit of a funky aftertaste to me.  Complexity is definitely there though.","Minnesota, USA","mnmike"
564,"2013-05-28",4.1,"500mL thanks to katie and sammi. Pours clear red tea with healthy red tinted beige foam. Big retention, complete sheets of lace. Stickier abbey quadrupel nose with dark cherry, something like candied blood orange. Taste is pretty much abbey quadrupel with anise, something like wormwood, dark cherry. Dry spices, wood dryness in finish. Some lactic acid balance in backend. Different, yummy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
564,"2013-05-27",4.0,"Thin white head. Deep red color. Sweet, dark fruit aroma, complex and yeasty. Malty and robust. This is a seriously good strong ale. Spicy and tasty. Very very good.

564,"2013-05-27",3.8,"Pours a mahogany color with a medium pillowy off-white head that leaves sheets of lacing.  Aroma is fig, plum, dark fruit, candied sugar, and nutty malts.  Rather smooth mouthfeel that leaves a nice warming sensation.  Taste is raisin, dark fruit, candied sugar, with some caramel malts on the finish.  Not my favorite style but well balanced and drinkable.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"
564,"2013-05-27",4.3,"Pours to a deep mahogany brown body with a rocky off white tan head. The aroma is candi sugar, cola, treacle,  banana,  clove, and tobacco.  Flavors are extremely similar to westmalle dubbel.  Earthy tobacco,  malt, molasses, yeasts, bananas, and clove. A light peppery alcohol actually rounds this beer out, but Im looking forward to throwing a little age on this beer. Medium full body bur clean. Velvety texture.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
564,"2013-05-27",4.5,"Enjoyed via a bottle from Sendiks in Whitefish Bay. Pours a sable brown with a lacy tan head that clings over an inch up the glass. The smell is cola with a touch of grassy effervescence. It is smooth and silky on the palette with some of that same cola flavor along with dry, bitter hops. There is a slight booziness that will most likely mellow with age. I expect it to only improve as time goes on.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","rbfishstick"
564,"2013-05-26",4.1,"500 ml bottle.  Pours a very dark brown, near black, with a big fluffy tan head.   Aroma of candi sugar, belgian yeast, mild sweetness.  Lots of fruit in the aroma.  Banana, cherries, some berries.  Flavor is intoxicating, rich belgian yeast, strong toffee, caramel, and brown sugar notes.  Medium bodied, near perfect carbonation.  Fantastic mouthfeel.  Finishes mildly sweet.  Absolutely fantastic beer.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
564,"2013-05-25",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2014 Elegant clear dark ruby brown. Rich, frothy, lasting off-white head. Thick lace. Aroma is voluptuous, sweet; dark fruit, banana, caramel, spices, yeast, banana bread... Flavor syncs up, add a touch more alcohol. Soft and creamy. Medium body with a spicy, clean, bitter finish along with some alcohol warming. This is a Dubbel worthy of high praise. (5/25/13)
UPDATE (12/31/14) After over a year and half of aging this has gotten even better. Still carbonated, soft, and creamy. Even richer and more complex caramel, toffee, fruit, and bread, and spice. Alcohol hides a little more. Still has a light bitterness. Luscious. This has really come together wonderfully.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
564,"2013-05-25",4.2,"Aroma is initially hard to decipher.  Malt for sure.  A little sugar, maybe caramel.  A little sweet, but not really like candy.

Taste-bananas, malt, sugar, caramel.  Fairly smooth, but occasionally bitter.  Taste dissipates quickly, but then comes back with a little tinge in the back of the throat.

Never ending head.","Wisconsin, USA","MarinEvelyn"
564,"2013-05-24",3.6,"500mL bottle.  Poured clear, coppery-amber with a dense, creamy beige head.  The aroma picked up nutty notes, toffee, and marzipan with earthy and lemony-herbal accents.. banana and clove esters emerged as it warmed.. spicy and quite yeasty by the time it got to room temperature, but very well balanced.  The flavor found nutty notes, chocolate, and aged caramel at the core with banana, clove, and fruity yeast around.. spicy yeast impression on the finish paired with a misplaced green hop presence.  Medium-bodied and quite bitter/spicy on the palate.. a hair too sharp and bitter, but otherwise a tasty and interesting brew.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
564,"2013-05-24",3.9,"Clear dark amber pour, soft white head - tons of lacing on this one. Nose is dark fruit, some belgian spiciness and a little alcohol. Very good, but a touch hot on the finish. Will be interested to see how time treats it.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
564,"2013-05-24",4.2,"** This is a dark strong. Dark burgundy with a nice foam. About a quarter inch but is hangs around. Aroma is malt, caramel and yeast. Big malt and caramel flavor. Some dried fruit and a little coffee in the finish. Maybe tobacco I cant decide. Well carbonated. This is an excellent beer! World class. Very limited release but if you can get some you?re in for a treat.","Illinois, USA","Doghair"
564,"2013-05-23",3.8,"Murky brown pour with amber-orange edges and off-white head.  Nose is yeasty baked banana bread, light pear, and faint bubblegum.  Flavor is gentle banana and yeast with a pronounced toasted biscuit and light roasted malt.  Fairly dry finish with residual burnt toast and faint banana.  Carbonation is rather prickly.  A nice offering.  Cheers and congrats!","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
564,"2013-05-23",3.6,"500ml bottle - Pours murky brown with a thick foamy tan head. Lots of plum and dark bread on the nose, with some sweet yeastiness and some light candi sugar. A bit of boozy warmth. Taste is sweet and a bit of oaky, bready booziness. The dark fruit is a bit muted and the bread is dark and a bit bitter. A bit of spice. Smooth and soft in the mouth. A bit sharp...I think a little time will help this one, but it was still pretty tasty.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
564,"2013-05-22",4.0,"500ml bottle, purchased at Discount Liquor Milwaukee. Pours a deep, dark brown color with a huge tan head that recedes pretty quickly, leaving a bunch of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, dark fruit, raisin, molasses. Medium on the palate with soft, creamy carbonation.  Flavor is sweet, malty, bready, nutty, some spicy Belgian yeast, a little bit of alcohol heat, with a sweet, malty finish.  I really like this beer.  I would like to do a side by side with Westmalle Dubbel, just to see how it stands up.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
564,"2013-05-22",4.1,"3rd rating.  Deep cherry brown body.  Foamy, beige head laces up the glass.  Sweet dark fruit aroma, relatively classic and true to style.  Really full, expressed fruity yeast tones.  Has more of a Trappist depth, maybe lacking the effervescence/mouthfeel though.  Quite a phenomenal Dubbel, this can hang with the big boys.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
564,"2013-05-21",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2016 500ml bottle. Pours a beautiful dark plumb color with a frothy tan head that leaves some really nice lacing. Smell is spicy yeast, banana, dark fruits, bready malt, and sugar sweetness. The flavor is similar but better. Rich malt flavors, not too cloyingly sweet. It is fruity but spicy, light herbal bitterness in the finish. Havent really had a US Belgian-styled ale that was quite this good. Wasnt expecting it to be this tasty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
564,"2013-05-20",4.6,"Well it looks like I might be the first one ever to publish a review of New Glarus 20th Anniversary Strong Ale. As a liquor store guy, you have to enjoy the perks of the job sometimes! The word is this is extremely limited and rationed throughout the state so make sure you grab it while you can. 

This one pours a dark amber color with a foamy beige head. The aroma is very yeasty with hints of bread, tart fruit, and banana. Very inviting with its traditional Belgian characteristics. 

Holy cow is this beer smooth! To compliment the smooth texture is a rich, deep flavor that is very well balanced. Yeast, caramel malt, banana, and citrus are all present and very tasty. This is a slow sipper that delivers a lot of great flavor. It finishes sweet with a great malty after taste.  The lacing it leaves behind is pretty impressive too!

This is a brew well worthy of being a 20th Anniversary celebration release. This ranks pretty high with me amongst other New Glarus beers. Im sure this will earn a place in the hearts of many beer lovers. All I can say is I will look forward to a delicious 25th Anniversary brew 5 years from now! -Chris Lemke of WisconsinBrewReview.com","Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA","Lemke10"
