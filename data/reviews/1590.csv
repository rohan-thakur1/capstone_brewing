1590,"2008-04-20",3.4,"72 cl. Bottle [Thanks to Storm] this was my first sake, and what a great experience. Quit different than anything else that I have tried. Very watery pale yellow looking, but with somewhat of a glow. Aroma was quite difficult to describe, but what I picked up was menthol, liquorish, vegetable. Over the palate came alcohol, vegetable, strange floral feel, some flower. Full bodied with an alcoholic texture. 
Alcoholic flower like finish. My first Sake was a very interesting experience. Would have liked it with Sushi.

1590,"2008-02-13",3.6,"Hazed yellowish milky liquid. No sparkle, so m a bit leery. Strong sweet rice aromas with just a touch of birch sap in the background. LIght vanilla and white jelly bean flavors. A touch of burn in the finish but otherwise the alcohol is quite minimal. Quite smooth and a relaxing type sake. I would enjoy this after a nice dinner.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1590,"2008-01-07",3.0,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a extremely small sized head of medium sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a hazy very softly carbonated light clear  hazy with some floating particulate white colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was vinous with rice and mild woody esters. The mildly vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a strong vinous alcohol aftertaste. The strong flavor contained notes of alcohol and ricel. A decent one that I would consider buying again.  My bottle also read 15% ABV.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1590,"2007-12-31",3.8,"This one looks very unique, which really begs one to consume it.  The still body is a lightly hazy grayish tint, with tons of very fine floating particulate suspended throughout the liquid.  Fairly thick legs coat the glass well on a swirl, indicating a substantial body.  Like the appearance, the aroma is fairly unique.  Notes of koji, rice pudding, and freshly sliced plums meet a solitary drop of lemon, combining to make a very inviting scent profile.  The flavor is simultaneously sweet, sharp and tangy.  Koji dominates, but fruity notes and a lemony creaminess play major roles as well.  As the look hints, the body is on the fuller side, with a unique tingle showing some carbonation that I didnt expect.  Very solid, unique Nigori.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1590,"2007-05-23",4.0,"180 ml bottle reads 15% abv.  Clean yeasty sake aroma.  Pours almost clear with little chunks.  Wow, intense flavor, tingles the tongue with a hint at carbonation.  Sweet and tangy, sharp right off the bat.  The aftertaste has some anise notes.  Amazing.  Very delightful!","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
1590,"2005-04-28",2.6,"Milky light white color, light sparkling qualities. I expect something different when the cap releases pressure when you open it. The nose has some earthy koji and light tropical fruits, not much in the realm of umami or alcohol, slightly medicinal as well. The flavor is a real turn off, very tart with more a slap of koji on the tounge. The tail is brief but not very good. Overall the alcohol is very well hidden but the flavor just doesnt qualify this as an easy drinking beverage. Thanks to IdahoJizake for letting me try this.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1590,"2005-04-27",2.4,"First (and last) sparkling sake I will ever try. Surprisingly clean pour for a nigori, moderately cloudy/chunky. Very citrusy aroma; can sense the carbonation. Pleasing smell but thats where any good points of this sake end. Very strong citrus flavor; carbonation is far too overpowering to assess much more on the taste. Alcohol is not evident until the less than desireable aftertaste finally fades away. Dont waste your money on this unless you like sparkling sake; just dissolve some aspirin in lemon-lime gatorade to get the same effect.","Nampa, Idaho, USA","IdahoJizake"
