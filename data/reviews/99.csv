99,"2017-03-15",4.2,"Bottle with commonmac during March madness. Dark reddish copper with thick white head and good lacing. Really good strong pumpkin spice aroma with underlying alcohol. Taste is heavy in spice , especially nutmeg and sugar. Sweet and sticky. Has good body, almost like it had real pumpkin in it. Alcohol presence heavier than most pumpkin ales. Alcohol could have been hidden better, and a bit of off balance, but very good. Glad I took a schlaflyer on this one. Thoroughly enjoyed it.","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
99,"2017-03-15",4.0,"12oz bottle shared by commonshawn and purchased by Qponnagy. Pours an eye-pleasing copper/well-lit amber with a quarter finger eggshell white head. Aroma of pumpkin pie spices potent enough to fill the nose from afar. Cinnamon and nutmeg seem to be at the forefront. Taste struggles to fulfill the expectations brought about by the aroma but the pumpkin spices are still prevalent. Slightly thin mouthfeel but the alcohol presence makes you take notice. There is a malty/bready quality playing a role as well. Finish does make you think youve just eaten a piece of pumpkin pie soaked in alcohol. Probably exactly what Schlafly was attempting to execute. For people who enjoy this style, I think this should be a must try.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

99,"2016-11-12",4.1,"Thanks Steve.
This was poured into a becher pint glass.
The appearance was a dark amber/red/brown color with a mild concave lacing on the sides. No head. Carbonation could be seen rising.
The aroma balances absolutely awesome between the pumpkin sweet flesh to the spices of allspice, ginger and cinnamon.
The flavor, once again, has an incredible balance between the malts and the spices. Some pie crust, but subtle. Pumpkin flesh aftertaste. No finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability. Spices just end up blending so well that they dont even emit any harshness on my tongue.

Pours a hazy and very dark golden orange color thats almost brown with dark burnt orange edges and a one finger beige head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Steaks of lace left behind. 

Sweet pumpkin pie aroma with a decent balance of pumpkin purée and autumnal spices. Pumpkin seed, pie filling, nutmeg and vanilla along with cinnamon and brown sugar. Subtle vegetal quality but more dessert like than earthy. 

Medium body with a strong zesty autumnal spice presence that dominates up frot lingering over the sweet malts before a sweet pumpkin pie/dessert presence shows up in the finish. Peppery with ginger, clove and cinnamon followed by caramel malt, pumpkin purée, vanilla and nutmeg. Interesting how the flavor profile changes mid palate. Still tons of spice but more dessert like in the finish. Only a subtle vegetal presnce but it makes it a bit more organic tasting than a pure dessert beer.

Pours clear, dark amber color with a modest tan head. A small amount of sediment lurking at the bottom of the bottle was added to the pour. 

Despite plenty of pie spices, the pumpkin shines thru as well. More spicy in the flavor and feel than in the nose, particular the cinnamon component. Perhaps due to a richer malt base, even with rather bold spicing this pumpkin is not over-spiced. Those not liking cinnamon probably will disagree; this has enough cinnamon to, I think, add a slight burn to the feel. Still, very nice mix of flavors. 

O: very similar to the Whole Hog Pumpkin I had a couple of days ago in both profile and overall quality.

A: Pours a chestnut brown color. The head is about one fingers high, with an off-white shade. Its

S: No doubts here that this one is spiced very well. Tons of nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon invade the nostrils in a good way. As strong as the spices are, they never overpower the pumpkin notes by any stretch. In fact, allowing it to open up will create more pumpkin in the aroma. Cant fault the labeling - this really smells like pumpkin pie.

T: And it really tastes like pumpkin pie, too. Spices hit the taste buds first (think allspice), quickly followed by a wave of both sweet cream and pumpkin. Touches of tart fruit esters appear near the back end. No hint of the 8% anywhere, either. Im pretty sure this is exactly what a pumpkin ale should be: boldly flavored, relatively deep, yet balanced and approachable. Great work.

M: The sweetness is (thankfully) kept in check with a well-attenuated, dry body and soft carbonation. So, not only does it capture the essence of pumpkin pie, it goes down almost as easily as a Bud Light.

99,"2013-08-28",3.8,"Old copper pour with a 1 finger, very creamy beige head. Aroma is full of sweet and earthy pumpkin, dark caramel, lactose like sweetness, sweet woody notes, like Palo Santo, toast and some really expertly blended pie spices, most pumpkin spiced beers tend to come out clove heavy to me, but this one has it all pretty well worked out. Flavor starts off with sweet caramel, sweet barley, lots of toast and that great blend of spices continues to be awesome, the full nutty earthy sweetness of the gourds comes out midway in a very enjoyable fashion, it finishes with some spice and spicy hop bitterness coming in, but it leaves with a nice, mellow cinnamon and nutmeg finish. Medium body with a creamy, syrupy entry, and off dry, but still slightly chewy/syrupy finish, medium carbonation. Pretty damn good stuff, one of the best pumpkin ales I have had, very well sorted out.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
99,"2013-08-28",3.3,"12 oz. Clear deep copper-orange with a small ring of bubbles. Aroma is the usual suspects of cinnamon and nutmeg, with a hint of pumpkin/squash and some leafy hop. Tastes of the pie spices, caramel, wheat and just enough traces of baked pumpkin flesh to keep it interesting. Medium body is sweet, has a smooth carbonation and is mostly balanced by some light astringency from the spices. This is a quality brew and hides the 8% well, but follows the pack with the heavy dose of pie spices. The saving grace is that some nice baked pumpkin/squash notes finally show up in the aftertaste.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

99,"2013-08-20",4.5,"I tried this one on 8/24/10. Finally, after a couple of years of drum-beating, Im getting to try this sought after brew. I picked up a sixer at Norms in Vienna.

I poured into a pint glass.

Ap: Orange/red appearance with a little head and tons of carbonation. A definite ""see-through"" beer - no haze whatsoever.

Ar: Nutmeg is very upfront, with brown sugar and cloves. Smells like candy. Yum!

T: Impressive! This beer is not a sugary mess, but a very well-balanced fruit/vegetable beer (not a dessert one like ""Pumking""), and barely a trace of alcohol. I detect mild honey and marshmallow. Ahhhh...

P: The sweetness in not cloying in any way and the carbonation level is perfect.

O: This may be my new favorite beer of choice around the harvest season. I would never have pegged this as being a brew with an 8% ABV. 

Still, Southern Tiers ""Pumking"" is a force to be reckoned with. I am already planning a pumpkin beer tasting with my wife involving: Dogfish ""Punkin"", ""Pumking"", and this tasty brew. It should be interesting!

NOTE: On 11/9/10, I did a pumpkin tasting with Williamsburg Alewerks, Saranac, and this one. The Schlafly still won! I continue to be impressed with this beer.","Washington DC, USA","Chaneybr"

99,"2013-06-25",4.0,"THOUGHTS: Very flavorful. More than seemingly possible Hid alcohol very well. A little overly sweet, but thats not always a bad thing in a pumpkin beer. Almost all sweet, fruity pumpkin and hardly any vegetal pumpkin. A true pumpkin pie beer. But its mostly pumpkin with the spices show up as supporting characters. A little lighter than most pumpkin beers. Especially for one that was so flavorful.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark amber with a small, khaki head that nearly diminished all the way and left virtually no lacing. The aroma had moderate caramel; hints of sour pumpkin; honey; brown sugar; tons of sweet and fruity pumpkin. The initial flavor was heavily sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was moderately sweet and slightly acidic, bitter and sour. There was sweet pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices, apple, sour pumpkin, pancake syrup. The medium body was oily with very fizzy carbonation and a dry finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

99,"2012-12-20",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2013 The beer pours brownish orange with a minimal tan head, and the aroma is a medium-strong mixture of nutmet, clove, and roasted pumpkin with hints of caramel malts. When sipped, the sweetness is undeniable, but it isnt overpowering because of the hearty and sour pumpkin flavor that is reminiscent of pumpkin pie. The medium body, nearly flat carbonation, and slick texture make this beer very enjoyable because it isnt too hard to sip, and the spice-filled finish fades quite quickly, which leaves you wanting more.","Columbia, Missouri, USA","EtTuCthulhu"
99,"2012-12-06",3.8,"Thanks to HopsMatt for landing this long time want of mine! 12 oz bottle into a DFH signature.

A - Pours a deep dark red color that borders on purple. Clear with some small streams of rising carbonation. One finger of dirty tan foam forms but vanishes quickly. Modest amount of lacing. 

S - I cant say this deviates much from the other popular pumpkin ales. Loads of pumpkin pie spice initially. Cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, and nutmeg. A bit of caramel malt and a touch of earthy gourdness on the finish. Pretty standard stuff here, but done quite well.

T - Pie spices of clove and nutmeg in the beginning. Very sweet malty middle. The beer is finished by some pumpkin flesh and a lingering cinnamon spice. Tasty, albeit a bit too sweet.

M - Medium bodied and well carbed. Very easy drinking despite the 8% abv. The sweetness of the beer does catch up with it after a while.

O - I was expecting a bit more. This is a great pumpkin beer with plenty of spices, malt, and earthiness kept in pretty well balance. Tends to get a bit sweet on the finish.

Flavor is very near perfection. Some squashy-ness up front quickly followed by a healthy wallup of cinnamon and nutmeg. A quick shot of vanilla along with some whipped cream but the spices hold strong. Never do they become overwhelming but rather quite nicely balance with everything else. Bitterness is extremely light and nearly imperceptible. This beer is just a touch sweet and not a sugar bomb like so many pumpkin beers. A nice, dry finish with just a hint of warmth from the alcohol.

Scent is very faint, but pleasant, pumpkin pie...
Taste is the opposite of faint...a lot of.....a lot.
Thickly pumpkin with all the trimmings.....nutmeg, clove, cinnnamon...very malty.
No burn from the alcohol, but a soft warmth is felt.

99,"2012-09-28",3.8,"A really very nice seasonal pumpkin ale.  Pumpkin flavor is at the fore, but develops into a backing note as the spice flavors carry the latter half of each mouthful.  Very little alcohol flavor, despite the higher ABV.  Very good...worth seeking each fall!","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
99,"2012-09-27",4.0,"Finally getting around to this one. Tis the season.

$10.99/sixer @ Nicks of Clinton in Waldorf, MD.

The beer is transparent and appears a dark amber hue, sporting a half inch of beige head. 

The aroma offers autumn spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, squash, brown sugar. 

The flavor brings a nice malt backbone to support the sweet, spicy flavors. Right away, I can tell this brew is a notch above most other pumpkin beers I have had. Flavorful and well balanced. Lots of spice character, but done gracefully. Liongering cinnamon, slightly dry. Many beers of this ilk becoming cloying rather quickly, whereas Schlafly Pumpkin Ale beseeches the consumer to keep coming back for more.

Light to medium in body with a smoth feel on the palate. Soft but present carbonation.

Overall, this is a winner. Im happy to have five more to ring in my favorite season.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
99,"2012-09-26",5.0,"since everyone has already mentioned the cinnamon, nutmeg, spice taste and roma or the copper colored pour. I thought i would just stay away from the obvious despcriptions and mention how amazed and pleased i was when i opened this bottle. I first had this beer a few weeks ago and my liqour store sold out of it, i finally got ahold of it last night. Just the thought of this beer had my brain struggling to focus on everyday routine and instead imagining that beer touching my tongue. The time came i was able to pour the beautiful copper beer into my tulip style glass the aroma filled my house, I took a sip and the taste was exactly what ive been wating for. This is without any argument the best pumpkin ale ive ever put my hands on and cant wait for my next schlafly pumkin ale","","windblownwheat"

This year I got some right away and was so happy I did. This ale is loaded with pumpkin and spices it really is like drinking a slice of pumpkin pie with a little less sugar and no crust. The alcohol taste is not very prevalent despite its 8% which makes it dangerous. You wont like this if you dont like pumpkin because it is a giant warm and fuzzy spicy pumpkin hug.","Springfield, Missouri, USA","Yipon"

99,"2012-09-01",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2012 2012 seasonal just out.Bottle to goblet.Pour is a amber dark carmel.Clear little to no head.
 ARoma straight off was more in cinnamon,then clove,nutmeg.It was a bready pieish at first but clove/cinnomon take over then it fizzles to a minute almost slight carmelSome alchohol and slight yeastiness..Pretty mild not what I was expecting but its decent. It kind of mutes itself upon warming giving  justsome sweet alcohol with a very faded  pumpkin pie /yeast presence.
 Taste is spice,the clove/cinnomon stand out more.Smooth with dark carmel,a little overly clovish finish.It seems to be spice a bit more than average.Some citrus in there as well.Some honey notes. Im a little disapointed in the malt backbone of this although there  is more of a sweet carmelness about it,it seems to lack a creamyness  or toastinesor more of a malty breadiness that I like more in pumpkin beers. Seems to be more of a sweet slickness with clove.There is a dry alcohol finish that kind of put this under for me.There is a big sweet light/dry strength to this which could use more body to. And this reminds me of Big Red gum often off and on thoughout this beer. Its a good pumpkin beer but I think Its not up there with some of the others,so maybe in a top 20 for me with this.I just think I shoulda bought  one sixer rather than two.","Iowa, USA","jmohno"

Very tasty. Needs cool whip. Very enjoyable blend of spices, pumpkin, and just good ol beer goodness. Tasted a little better on tap, but still very good.

Nice feel. Slick, wet and moderately carbonated. Not very bitter, but the aftertaste lingers oh so nicely with a spicy slick feel.

Tastes are similar to the aroma: spice and pumpkin  and some peppery alcohol notes in the finish. This is like drinking a rich pumpkin pie made with lots of cream.

99,"2011-11-09",3.9,"12 oz bottle. I find very few flaws in this beer for the style. Its really half pumpkin pie, half malty strong ale with great balance all-around and just enough of every ingredient. The nose consists of blended spices, with nutmeg and cinnamon being the most prominent, pumpkin pie, mixed, mellow herbs, and rich, malty cereal grains. A decent pour as well, with a finger and half of bubbling off-white head, sticky retention, and a semi-translucent deep amber color. The palate is unexpectedly strong (until I read the abv), especially for a spiced ale like this, though still creamy, rich and malty, with just enough hops to balance things nicely. Flavors start off with sweet fruits and buttery pumpkin, leading to more mixed grain malt and spices similar to the aroma. Herbal notes stand out a bit more through the sweet and spicy finish. Overall, and considering that pumpkin ales are usually not my thing, I think Schlafly did a pretty darn good job constructing this one.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

99,"2011-09-27",3.0,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2012 Tasted on-tap 9/17/2011 at the Hop in the City Festival in a clean half-pint taster glass. I was told this would be ""pumpkin pie in a glass,"" and thats pretty accurate. Ive had several pumpkin seasonals in recent years and Schlaflys is the best. Everyone seems to love it: it was the longest line at the festival, and its piled high at grocery stores this time of year. Im happy to sample it each fall as a novelty, but I personally find it kinda weird, watery, spiced ale. I must say Im shocked to read it is 8% ABV. The alcohol is very well-hidden. Still, Id rather have a real beer with a real piece of pie--but hey--maybe I just need to stir-in some Cool-Whip.

The nose is heavy on the spices; clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg are present. The flavor profile presents the aforementioned spices up front, coupled with some sweetness from the malt profile - while the body rounds out fairly negatively for me, actually. I suppose the squash adds a touch of interest. This is a nice holiday ale, but it didnt quite do it for me as a pumpkin in general.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

A - Burnt amber color with an average sized, foamy, bubbly, slightly stick, white head. Decent retention leaving a decent lacing.

S - Spices (primarily cinnamon and nutmeg) fight with slightly burnt caramel aroma for prominence. Mid to late smell there is plenty of sweet pumpkin pie aroma with some brown sugar. Pretty nice.

T - Very nice flavors. There is a good amount of actual pumpkin taste as opposed to pumpkin pie taste. That said the spices come on strong, especially on the finish. Clove is strongest but there is also cinnamon, nutmeg and all spice. Some buttery and brown sugar flavors mid sip. Some burnt caramel malt as well. Not overly sweet or spiced but a good mix.

M - Medium to light body with average carbonation. A touch too thin but not bad.

D - Great balance between sweet, spice and actual pumpkin flavor. Alcohol is very well hidden, no way Id guess it at 8%. Very enjoyable beer to drink and one I could drink a couple of in a night, despite the ABV.

Notes: Great pumpkin beer, probably the best one Ive had as of yet. Actual pumpkin flavor is wonderful compared to pumpkin meaning pumpkin pie.

Color is a slightly-hazed orange color that is just a bit dark. A short white head with just a bit of lacing forms on the brew. The nose is fairly sweet with some nice pumpkin pie notes as well as a pretty good amount of pumpkin-pie spices.

The flavor is really nice with the sweet pumpkin, brown sugar, and spices really integrating together quite well. I couldnt believe that the alcohol was this high when I read it after drinking this one down a bit--its not detectable at all. Feel is nice and creamy. Medium body with good carbonation.

99,"2010-12-29",3.6,"Overall a great seasonal I expected no less from Schafly. Typically when Ive had a poor release from them it is because the bottle has been sitting too long. This one was close to that point but still has some legs. I wouldnt sit on it much longer but it should be solid for at least another week or two.

Aroma / Appearance - A maroon red body a little darker than Santas suit the beer even had a white fringe. Thick and creamy it filled the glass well. Warm pumpkin pie with an emphasis on whipped cream created a sweet vegetal sensation. It was a bit more spicy and earthy than sweet though (like pumpkin ales at the other end of the spectrum).

Flavor / Palate - The chewy mouthfeel is like a mixture of 25% water and 75% pumpkin pie filling. Paired with sprinkles of nutmeg, a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream, and more holiday spices the combination is very seasonal. Straddling that line between something to drink several of and one to savor the beer has a nice balance. The rosy finish adds the feeling of stepping out of the cold into a warm hallway. I wouldnt mind having a six pack of this around October.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

From notes, 10/2008.

Pours a carrot orange, yet sits blood-red, almost velvet, in the glass. Nice lingering head. 

The smell on this one is poignant, in my opinion. As I sit here and type, I can smell the glass, eighteen inches from my nose. The cinnamon and nutmeg is strong and balanced by its malt profile. Great smelling pumpkin - complements fall nicely. In the mouth reigns cinnamon, then nutmeg, then a honey sweetness, then a light presence of ginger and cinnamon again. Excellent execution in both smell and taste.

More pleasing, full mouthfeel than I expected. Firm and velvety smooth. 

The 8.0% is hidden fantastically and, when fresh, this is killer. I have only had one pumpkin beer before this and it had quite a reputation. When I didnt like it, I swore off pumpkin ales for a short time, but couldnt resist this local offering. Come to find, weakness of will can be a good thing.

The bite ""seems"" to cloud some of the booziness, which is perceptible past the finish in a warm citric breathiness.  A good pumpkin ale, but clearly stronger spice on the nose than the tongue.  The spiky bitterness is also a bit off-putting and unexpected.  Still, with as strong an aroma as it has, it is sure to please.","New York, USA","Chronoflash"

Just seems like this beer hasnt come together yet (label notes a bottling of Aug 24, 2010). Overly carbonated and thin. Not going down easy. Not great.

2009 Version - Clear copper color, small white head that fades quickly. Aroma is very strong of cinnamon, with a more moderate nutmeg, pumpkin, apple and clove note. Flavor has a strong cinnamon note making it taste like spiced apple juice, nutmeg, light pumpkin, moderately sweet overall. Very fine carbonation and a thin body. Overall a very heavily spiced brew but the sweetness of the pumpkin and apples really makes it work.

This one is full and sweet like pumpkin pie.","Capital of Appalachia, Pennsylvania, USA","lithy"
99,"2008-10-12",2.9,"on tap at Nach Bar.  Wow, I am surprised to see this beers rating (and abv) as so high.  It was fine, but, like many tohers, not exactly what I’m looking for in a pumpkin beer.  It seems to struggle with making the pumpkin/spice work really well with the beer flavor.  And, like many other pumpkins, it also seems to be out of balance in that there is too much spice and not enough pumpkin.  Overall: not the best or worst pumpkin.  I admit though, there is a definite bias in all of my pumpkin ale ratings now that I have had PumKing, to which no pumpkin beer can compare IMO.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

I let this sit for a little bit after initially tasting and it definitely improves as it warms a bit...slick, bity mouth feel...flavor is of pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg and some caramel notes.

99,"2008-10-10",3.9,"On tap at the flying saucer in KC. Pours a clear, light red-orange with a small, white head that leaves a nicely laced ring around the beer and on the surface throughout the session. Aroma of pumpkin pie. Very nice and complex. Assortments of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger bread cookies, pumpkin bread, cloves, and sweet malts. The flavor is very similar. Lots of fresh pumpkin pie spices and a buttery sweet malt. Not too bitter and finishes warm. Full bodied and the alcohol is very well hidden. Overall, the best pumpkin beer Ive had to date.

99,"2008-09-29",4.5,"One of the best pumpkin beers out there. From the moment you pop the top and begin the pour, the aroma of fall arises. The taste of pumpkin pie or pumpkin muffins, slightly warming thanks to the decent ABV, and without being overly sweet. It’s well balanced with a semi-thick mouthfeel, and the aftertaste of cinammon and nutmeg grows pleasantly with each drink. Highly recommended.","Holts Summit, Missouri, USA","viethe"

I really like this beer...just dont let it warm up. cold its a beautiful gingerbreadie pumpkin pie masterpiece....as it warms it almost becomes a spicy hot mess.","chicago, Illinois, USA","wheninhell"
99,"2008-09-26",3.4,"Amber color with minimal head and very little carbonation.  Aroma is pleasant and is full of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Flavor is also full of Fall spices.  Nutmeg and cinnamon again with some over ripe fruit and alcohol.  Some nice ginger bread.  ABV seems unnecessarily high and the beer would have been better served with less.  It is very much a pumpkin pie effect which asks whether it should be served with KoolWhip on top.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

Absolutely worth trying.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","NeoHippie2"
99,"2008-09-21",3.8,"This may be the best pumpkin ale available outside the specialty stores.  It’s flavor is somewhat diluted but only by its’ high alcohol content.  The aroma is above average, but over advertises the actual flavor.  Overall, a worthy effort.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sanfiltj"
99,"2008-09-17",3.8,"Pours a dark coppery color with little to no head.  Aroma is ginger bread, with strong hints of nutmeg or cinnamon, with a slight fruity character, like artificial banana flavoring.  The first sip tastes just like fresh pumpkin pie.  As you drink on, other flavors emerge.  Cinnamon toast and spiced or baked apple come forward.  This is perfect on crisp fall days where brown leaves crinkle under your steps.","Carbondale, Illinois, USA","ilherps"

It is the sweetest tasting ale i have ever had. If i had smelled it at room temperature i would have sworn i was sniffing the inside of my grandmother’s over after cooking a pumpkin pie. it tastes like a big piece of cinnamon with a little pumpkin on it.

The typical pumpkin spices of cinnamon and clove with real pumpkin mixed in quite nicely. The taste is similar and fairly sweet with the blend between the spices and pumpkin just right. Medium mouthfeel with a long finish.  Considering that I only had a small sample of this, and that it must of had a few months on it already, it was a very solid pumpkin beer.

Aggressive for a pumpkin ale at 8%.  tase is as expected: sweet pumpkin and spice with hint of alcohol burn.  I think making this sort of a ""bigger"" pumpkin beer was a good idea.

Pours a bright, orange-amber color; significant white head with good retention and creamy fine-bubbled lacing that lasts forever; a great pour.  Very pleasant spice profile in the aroma: an emphasis on nutmeg and cinnamon, but withouth any of the typical harsh, dry spiciness that tends to inhabit pumpkin ales; this is instead warm and fiery and ultimately soft.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: warm spiciness and some creamy sugar notes; solid levels of carbonation; sort of a one-dimensional sugar-based maltiness, but the spice profile is (like the aroma) expectional and pleasant; definitely one of the better pumpkin beers Ive had.

The aroma picked up deep pumpkin spice, nutmeg, and cinnamon.. amplified by the alcohol, which was never overt.. really enjoyable, and probably the best smelling pumpkin beer Ive come across!  The flavor was marred slightly by some alcohol that lingered in there.. nutmeg, pumpkin spices, and other darker spices hit heavy early and last through a long finish.. some vanilla and creamy spices help support the spicage.  Medium-bodied and spicy with a really nice sweet/spicy finish that made me think of hay rides and pumpkin picking.. still a bit sharp with booze at points.

Crystal clear amber orange, with a off white ring with some continual risine carbonation.  I really get a lot of ginger in the nose.  Cinnamon and nutmeg are also evident, as well as as a healthy amount of toasted malts.  Maybe a bit too much ginger flavor.  The spices are easily the highlight, but not obnoxious.

99,"2007-01-23",3.8,"Pours a clear copper orange with a nicely-lacing ring of white head.  Aroma of fresh earthy pumpkin, cinnamon spice, and toasty caramel malt.  Body starts sweet and caramely malty with a good viscosity, and nice nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin flavor.  Finishes with a touch of warmth and lingering holiday spice.  One of the best pumpkin beers Ive had.  Thanks to Duane for the bottle!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
99,"2007-01-21",3.4,"Sept 06 bottle. Beer is clear, light-medium amber color. Head is virtually nonexistent.<P>
The aroma is good. Malty with light notes of caramel, toasted grain, cookie; Hoppy with a light note of flowers; Moderate miscellaneous notes of cooked pumpkin flesh, ginger, light notes of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Aromatic net is pumpkin pie custard cradled in a flaky whole-wheat crust. Yum!<P>
The flavor is lightly-to-moderately sweet, lightly acidic, trace bitter with a long, lightly bittersweet, trace acidic finish.<P>
The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is average, but fragile.<P>
Vibrant pumpkin quality achieved without loosing the beeriness of the brew. Nice.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"
99,"2007-01-21",2.7,"Sep 06 bottling. Head is initially small, fizzy, off-white, fully diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (cookie), with notes of allspice/nutmeg, brown sugar, pumpkin. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively/soft carbonation. Reasonably good nose, but very sweet, simple, and syrupy overall.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
99,"2007-01-10",2.8,"Bottle... Clear, amber ale with a small, fizzy, off-white head. The nose is all crystal malt and heavy spice... cinnamon and nutmeg. Smells like pumpkin pie to me. Heavily sweet flavor, again, with lots of crystal/caramel malt notes and heavy spice. No semblance of balance... none intended, Im certain. Full-bodied and creamy with modest carbonation. Finishes sweet and spicy. Not one of my favorite styles. This one, in particular, is way too sweet and spicy for me. Kudos to vyvvy for sending this bottle my way!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
99,"2007-01-06",3.8,"Bottle:  Courtesy of Styles.  Very nice spiced aroma with lots of ginger, nutmeg, and clove.  It pours a bright transparent amber with a minimal white head.  The flavor starts with lots of nutmeg and light cinnamon.  The finish is more ginger and clove with some light grassy bitterness.  Pumpkin itself is rather faint.  The mouthfeel is suprisingly syruppy for a pumpkin ale. One of the better pumpkin ales Ive had in quite some time.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
99,"2007-01-05",3.1,"From a bottle, thanks to Duane. The body is medium orange with a light khaki colored head. The aroma is strong with pumpkin and nutmeg. There is also a little bit of roses in this. The taste is fairly spicy with nutmeg and cinnamon. Pumpkin tastes are only present in the background. A buttery finish rounds this one out. A strange pumpkin ale that needs to have the spices backed down a lot. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and that distracted from the beer.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
99,"2006-12-16",4.4,"Wow!  Now this is a Pumpkin beer I could really get used to drinking year round!  Ive had several and this one is by far the best.  Its high alcohol content is nicely masked by the pumpkin pie flavor.  Schlafly makes some great beers!  I would highly recommend this one!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Doon"
99,"2006-12-08",4.3,"This is still one of my favorite beers.  Schlafly is a wonderful brewery and Im rarely disappointed in their work but this is really a gem.  On tap this 8% veggie beer has enough alcohol to make it distinctive in the booming pumpkin arena.  It has a very well balanced mix of spices on top of a good beer foundation.  It has the expected pumpkin pie taste.  It is nearly as good in bottle as on tap.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MrRain"
99,"2006-12-03",3.5,"Smells like pumpkin, with some cinammon and brown sugar and alcohol. Light Orange colour, no head. Carbonation right up there as if club soda, but pumpkin taste right there, not sweet nor bitter. A good representation of this blooming style. Thanks for the hitchhiker, jpm30.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
99,"2006-11-20",3.7,"Bottle from Duane.  Solid pumpkin ale.  Nice spicy pumpkin and cinnamon aroma.  Some beers smell great and the flavor doesnt follow through, but this one tasted as good as it smelled.  Good malt backbone with plenty of pumpkin pie flavor.  Alcohol is hidden very well; I had no idea this was 8%.  Good brew from Schlafly","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"
99,"2006-11-11",4.2,"Nicle copper colored ale.  Upon pouring from the bottle it had a 2-finger head which did disipate fairly quickly.  Nice firm pumkin flavor throughout with a strong cinnamon presence.  The best pumpkin beer Ive had.  I found out they will bottle this again next year!","Millstadt, Illinois, USA","millstadtguy"
99,"2006-11-09",3.6,"12oz bottle via trade with Duane! - Thanks! - Pours amber with a short white head.  Aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, and light caramel.  Flavor is nutmeg and cinnamon dominated but there are a fair amount of caramel malts in this as well.  Smooth and easy to drink for a pumpkin ale.  Honestly one of the better ones Ive had this season..","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
99,"2006-11-02",3.7,"not much of a fan of the spice/veggie style, but Im always up for trying a pumpkin ale.  nice aroma of pumpkin spice, cinnamon and nutmeg.  flavor is more of the same with plenty of toasted malt mixed in as well.  nicely done!","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
99,"2006-11-01",3.8,"bottle-pours orange with a small white head.  i have had others do some nice lacing, but this one didnt.  nice is spiced to the max-cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, light fussel sweetness, light grainy tones.  flavors are dominated by spices however, there is some nice squash-like flavors in there to balance out the spice.  more pumpkin beer than most out there and done well (unlike weyerbacher).  Not a veggie bomb.  finish is cracker crust, spice and light alcohol.  definately the best pumpkin beer out there!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
99,"2006-10-17",4.0,"From a 12 oz. long neck bottle with a bottling date, Sep.11.06, served in a Schlafly pint glass.

Poured a clear orangey amber with a foamy head that settled into a thin lacing.

Tasty aromas of clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin pulp.

Good carbonation and a crisp, smooth light-medium bodied mouthfeel.

Nice pumpkin ale taste, a mingling of nutmeg and clove nuttiness, cinnamon, pumpkin and fleshy sweetness from the butternut squash, a brief flash of alcohol towards the end and a spicy malty finish, for the most part, the alcohol is masked until the end, then you can taste and feel its 8% abv.

The best pumpkin ale Ive had this season, well worth trying, especially if you like pumpkin ales.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"
99,"2006-10-14",3.1,"(Bottle) Pours a pale amber with a fizzy head that goes away quickly.  Aroma of cinnamon and cloves.  Yes, it does taste like pumpkin pie.  The sweet malt and spices come through as well.  Texture is thin, as is the mouthfell.  Slight alcohol warmth after the swallow.  Im not one for stuff in beer like fruit and vegetables, but this tastes pretty good.  Still not my style, but decent.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
99,"2006-10-13",3.6,"pours clear orange with small head.  aroma pumpkin pie. flavor sweet pumpkin pie.  full smooth sweet mouth which is quite nice.  im not a big pumpkin pie fan but this is a well made thanksgiving beer.  its pretty potent too.","Cabot, Arkansas, USA","smhncabot"
99,"2006-09-30",3.7,"I honestly cant belive Im giving a pumpkin beer a good review.  I generally hate pumpkin beers, but this is actually solid and enjoyable.  It pours bronze with a light tan head that disappears fairly quick.  The aroma is like a sturdy pumpkin pie - pumpkin, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg.  It is missing whipped cream to round things out.  Medium body with just enough carbonation.  Startw with spice and a pumpkin / squash / veggie taste.  Some underlying malt shows through as well.  The finish has a spice punch followed by the squash taste.  A lingering spiciness stays in the mouth for a while.  This is probably the best pumpkin beer Ive had.  Well done Schlafly.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
99,"2006-09-29",3.4,"(draught) Nice orange-amber with very small head. Pumpkin and spice aroma. Flavor is pumpkin and fall spices (especially clove and nutmeg). You notice the alcohol in the finish.","Manchester, Missouri, USA","kwoeltje"
99,"2006-09-26",4.0,"This is probably the best pumpkin beer I have had to date.  Granted, I have not had a great pumpkin beer beforehand.  However, the presence of spice along with the distinct pumpkin pie taste made me feel fall slowly creep in.  That said, I think the beer would benefit from a bigger body.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"
99,"2006-09-21",4.2,"Bottle: Fan-freaking-tastic!  I love pumpkin beers, and this is the best Ive had by a wide margin.   Pours a reddish-amber color with a medium head that dissipates somewhat quickly.  Aroma is awesome, spicy pumpkin pie and caramel.  Flavor is spicy, almost like spiced-cider to begin with, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, theres that caramel again, and glorious pumpkin in the finish.  Hides its alcohol very, very well, exposing it only momentarily towards the bitter end.  Very balanced and quaffable.  I hope they start doing this one every year!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sethdude"
99,"2006-09-16",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 7, 2011 2006 Hop in the city Festival beer.  Pour is a dark copper with a huge white head.  Aroma is a very strong cinnamon with some cloves in there.  Flavor is pretty good.  Lots of cinnamon and spice with some cloves and maybe honey. Dont get much pumpkin in this but the other flavors are strong enough to carry this over the top.  A very decent attempt.  Im getting to like these pumpkin beers.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
99,"2006-09-12",4.0,"Bottled Sept 11 2006.  WOW!  Thanks Charles!  Bottle hissed as it was popped.  Poured three quarters, then gave it a good spin and dumped the rest.  It fizzed and sounded like a Coke.  The hue is a deep amber hue with a slight lingering ring of white head.  The cinnamon aroma hits me immediately.  The nutmeg and clove aroma is also present, but not to the intensity of the above stated cinnamon.  Smells fresh and wonderful.  Mouthfeel is medium to full with a sweet middle and a slightly dry bitter finish.  The cloying pumpkin pie flavor lingers.  The malt note is sweet and medium roasted.  Slight gram cracker note.  Then the spices hit at all different parts on the tongue.  The finish is tongue tingling spicy citrus hops.  That is also contributed to by the clove.  Well done, Sirs!  The base beer seems solid, and the ingredients and spices only tie this beer tighter together.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"
