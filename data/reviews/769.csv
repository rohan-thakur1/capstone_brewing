Taste is banana chocolate sweet, hints of fudge, with a twist of clove and increasing bitterness going into the finish. Texture is chewy, a bit oily, on a robust body.","Butzbach, Hesse, GERMANY","hauxe"

769,"2016-05-27",3.0,"12 oz. bottle. Pours a very dark brown with a large beige fizzy head that quickly retreats. Aroma is banana, along with faint chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is banana, bubble gum, clove, chocolate and roasted malt. I guess the combination works okay; its not something unacceptable (to me) like a sour porter, but I wouldnt go out of my way seeking it out.","Texas, USA","wombat23"
769,"2016-02-14",3.5,"A dark beer with a tan head. Sampled on draught in San Antonio. Spicy, with notes of banana and bubblegum, exactly as in the deScription. Delicious and highly drinkable. Some roasted notes and a mildly bitter finish. Unusual to taste a black Hefe, but definitely worth sampling.","","Cimbasso"

769,"2015-07-22",3.9,"Draft. The hefe had the goodness of a traditional hefeweizen - wheat, spices and banana - with the favor of a good porter (chocolate and toasted malt). Very enjoyable.","Huntsville, Alabama, USA","Aggiebob"
769,"2015-05-09",3.6,"Dark deb brownish amber with a foamy and sticky ivory head. Roasty and wheaty aroma with a little kiss of banana. Smooth, quaffable and balanced body with some semisweet earthy roasted meat, gently caramelized wheat malt, and a dry earhy finish with notes of wheat and roast. Semisweet overall, and basically tastes like its moniker--a black hefe. Pretty interesting.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
769,"2015-04-02",3.5,"Pours black in the glass. Spicy cloves and banana aroma with a hint of smoky char. Banana and bitter dark chocolate flavor notes. I also get a hint of some spice too. Overall, much better than expected. Good execution.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","llcooldave"
769,"2015-03-01",3.0,"Bottle. Pours a deep, deep brownish-black with only a ring head. Nose is a chocolate-banana milk shake, along with the clove one expects from a traditional hefe. Not much sweetness on the palate; very traditional hefe notes, along with a smoky baking chocolate and oolong tea element. Not too heavy, which is nice; suitable for Texas. Finish is long with a little treacly sweetness. Easy to drink; mild. Good.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
