2545,"2017-06-03",3.1,"Bottle 33cl, gusher alert! I lost about 10 % of the beer. Pours a semi hazy orange to amber with a medium off-white head and an aroma of floral hops, exotic fruit, lime, melon, grapefruit, grass, sweet malts and lemongrass. Taste is mainly dry hoppyness and some sweetness. Not very bad for a low alcohol beer.","Leiden, NETHERLANDS","TrefwoordPunk"
2545,"2017-05-20",3.9,"EBC 15 EBU 60. Amber/oranjekleurig bier met grote rots vormende en wand klevende crèmekleurige schuimkraag. Geur: hoppig, fruitig, sinaasappel, watermeloen, pompelmoes, brandnetels. Smaak: hopbitter, fruitig, citrus, pompelmoes en wat moutzoetigheid. Goede koolzuurprikkel. Medium body voor 2,5%. Afdronk: licht bitter, pompelmoes. Als straf, licht alcoholisch? Doe maar!","BELGIUM","Hopverdju"
2545,"2017-04-14",2.2,"330ml bottle (Uba ja Humal, Tallinn)
Over-hopped and husky aroma, a bit malty too. Rough palate. Husky malty taste, very bitter finish, a bit aggressive. Not a disaster for a low alcohol, but Id rather have any <1% kali in twice the volume if ABV was important.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
2545,"2017-02-28",2.6,"330ml bottle (thanks FatPhil). Frothy head, gushing out of bottle. Fruity, very malty, caramel and sweet in aroma. Fruity, caramel and sweet in taste. Sweet and caramel in aftertaste. Fizzy cRbonation. Surprisingly full bodied. Drinkable brew.","Reval, ESTONIA","Marduk"
2545,"2017-02-25",3.6,"Deep golden pour with hoge white head, exploding in the glass. Aroma is at first limited by the immense head; but then comes through the malty and hoppy tones, fruity (yellow fruits, grapes, citrus). Hoppy and dry flavour of medium to high bitterness, but also malty taste. Quite carbonated. I dont remember the older 2.5, but I think this is an interesting session IPA, with quite some body for only 2.5 ABV.","AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","DijkBier"
2545,"2017-02-10",3.9,"31/XII/16 - 33cl bottle from Gall&Gall (Delfgauw) @ Delft - BB: III/2017 (2016-1525) 
cloudy beige beer, huge aery off-white head, pretty stable, adhesive, leaving a nice lacing in the glass. Aroma: lots of tropical fruits, grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit, citrus. MF: ok carbon, medium to light body. Taste: lots of grapefruit, very bitter, medicinal, more grapefruit. Aftertaste: very dry and bitter finish, lots of tropical fruits, mainly grapefruit and pineapple.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
2545,"2017-01-23",2.9,"Spritziger, bitter-hopfiger Beginn. Noten von Stroh, wässriger Hintergrund. Steigend hopfig im Mittelteil, später auch bitterer. Geringe Würzigkeit, leicht grasig. Gefällt. 9/8/9/9/8/9","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"
2545,"2016-12-20",2.5,"Bottle from World of Drinks, Rotterdam. Bottle leaked all over my bag and this is not the first time with Emelisse beers. Very disappointed. Gushes a hazy medium amber with a huge frothy white head. The aroma is malt, light woody hop. The flavour is moderate to light bitter with a fizzy light hop bitter palate. Light to medium bodied with lively carbonation. Not impressed.","Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA","jmgreenuk"
2545,"2016-10-17",3.1,"From bottle, deep orange pour with a white head. Nose of grass, harsh bitterness, slight bitter grapefruit, herbal notes, malts, zest. Strong parfum bitterness. Ok","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
2545,"2016-10-09",2.6,"Bottle. Dry and resiny bitter hop water with citrus notes. Fairly crisp mouthfeel, lacks malt character, but thats to be expected from this ABV. The hop punch is not bad though, but the lingering resiny dryness can be a bit on the harsh side.","ESTONIA","suurjuust"
2545,"2016-09-10",3.3,"33cl bottle at home from Biernavigatie.nl. Nose is citric malty. Body is hazy orange, head is big, offwhite, creamy, mostly lasting, excellent lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, citrus, quinine, spices, leaves. Light sweet, heavy bitter. Finish is long lasting quinine heavy bitter, quite watery. Light body, slick texture, soft carbonation. Refreshing summer beer but not too easy due to heavy bitterness. Simple would be good but overhopped, way out of balance, I like it though.","Maarssen, NETHERLANDS","androman"

2545,"2016-07-25",2.6,"Bottle, bb 03.2017 (as twee punt vije el dorado hop, 2.5% abv, from UJH Kuressaare). Pours amber with huge whiteish head. The head stays. Aroma is hoppy, grassy, caramel. Flavor is very hoppy, bitter, grass, slight caramel. Body is very watery. Drinkability isnt really good, because its too harsh. Overall: drinkable, feels like very bitter hop water.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"
2545,"2016-06-13",1.8,"Not sure how they can call this a pilsener; definitely a session IPA. Either way, it tries to make up for the fact that theres little alcohol by being drier than a desert. Muddy copper colour. No character. Probably the worst beer Ive ever had from Emelisse.","Brussels, BELGIUM","adamnowek"
