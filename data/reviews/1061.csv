1061,"2017-05-18",3.6,"Filled from a pin at Middle Farm, East Sussex (sorry, didnt grab the ABV). Labeled as medium-sweet. Excellent perry that retains a good amount of pear flavor while also showing just a touch of tannins and earthiness. No sulfur flavor at all. Earthy, fruity, slightly sweet, and quite tasty.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
1061,"2016-03-04",3.5,"Bottle from The Bristol Cider Shop. It pours clear rich gold with a tiny bubbly head. The nose is soft, sweet, fresh, ripe pear, marzipan, frangipane, custard and just a touch of earth. The taste is iniatially sweeter than expected... sweet ripe pear, fruit pie, earth, some tannins, light astringency, pear skin and frangipane with a pretty dry and tannic finish. Medium body and just a hint of carbonation. Hides the alcohol exceptionally well. The balance makes this work very well. A pretty solid Perry by all accords.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
1061,"2016-01-16",3.5,"Aroma: intense pears, light alcohol, molasses. Appearance: clear gold, no head. Taste: medium sweet. Palate: sweets continue, molasses, slightly dry finish. Overall: very nice Perry, excellent pear flavours throughout. Bottle from Middle Farm, Lewes.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MrTipple"
1061,"2014-05-15",3.4,"500ml bottle. Pours golden yellow, sparkling with a lusciously sweet perry / vanilla aroma. Given how badly Ive rated all my previous encounters with Gwatkins this is surprisingly drinkable! Still rather sweet, with some pear drops and sugar, but theres a lot of juiciness here and the fruity character of the pear really shines. A touch of dusty funk on the finish too.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"
1061,"2012-06-26",3.9,"From Box at the Second Annual Manchester CAMRA Cider and Perry Festival. A lovely sweet perry with (on this occasion) an amazing aftertaste of almonds which lasts a few seconds. Not too easy to drink though due to the sweetness","Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","bfrposh"
1061,"2012-04-21",3.7,"7.5% perry in a box at Brigantes. Pours a light golden colour with an aroma of red apples, pears and alcohol. Similar flavours with an incredibly dry finish. Very nice!","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Benjii"

1061,"2010-06-12",3.3,"Tap (Gallows Bird, Espoo, Real Ale Festival 2003)
Simple light fruity aroma, not so clearly pear. Refreshing palate - has 
both dry and sweet components. Easy drinker, and covers the 7.5% well. 
Was hoping for more pear in a perry, but its still lovely and fruity, 
and the balance between dryness and sweetness is great. Rating

The aroma is lightly floral with a hint of the juicy fruitiness that is to come. Lovely juicy sweet pears in the mouth, very soft in mouth and incredibly easy drinking, there is just a hint of dryness at the end, a very decent perry that I could have easily consumed all afternoon.

1061,"2008-05-13",2.3,"I dont know about this one.  I dont have a lot of experience with the style.  Had a funky sour aroma, an aroma of pears and wood, perhaps pears still hanging from the tree in effect, with the combination of the two.  Very rough mouthfeel, slightly chalky, tastes like fruit skins and seeds and no actual fruit.  Horrible.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
1061,"2007-10-29",3.4,"500 ml clear bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. ABV is 7.5%. Cloudy yellowish grey to golden colour with a reddish hue. Fizzy head disappears instantly. Moderate carbonation in the glass. Lovely aroma of pears and oak, notes of fruit vinegar and farmhouse kitchen. The flavour is medium sweet, pears galore, oaky notes, hints of sulphur, slightly astringent finish. Not bad.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

Comments: Dark for a perry, yet a superbly fresh one with a generous pear flesh nose, juicy and balanced whose peaks are reached in its flowery, fragrant nose and soft-edged palate despite heavy tannins.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1061,"2007-06-19",2.6,"(Bottle 50 cl) Pours a clear, deep golden with no head whatsoever. Lovely almost perfumy aroma. Medium body, quite sweet with this extreme Gwathin astringency.

1061,"2007-05-19",3.7,"Bottle @ Copenhagen Øl Festival. No head and no lacing to be observed. Lovely golden colour. Reasonable dry notes of pear, apple, berries, wood and grape sugar. Medium bodied with a lively carbonation. Moderated sweet flavour with some acidic to balance this Perry. Nice sweet grape sugar/pear finish. Defiantly the best Perry so far.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"

1061,"2006-02-21",3.8,"From the barrel at Battersea Beer Festival.  Pale gold colour with that indefinable perry tinge. On the sweet side of medium but has plenty of tooth coating tannin to set that off and provide some backbone. Far more tannic than usual for a perry. Woody, but succulent and juicy at the same time. Finely balanced and beautifully made.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1061,"2006-02-10",4.1,"From a polypin at Battersea Beer Festival 2006.  I have to go with SilkTork on this one.  Pale gold, no head.  Red pear aroma, which is not huge but the flavour is terrific.  Very good pear fruit which is fleshy and succulent.  Not overly sweet.  Some wood and then quite a dry finish.  Yummy","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
1061,"2005-06-07",3.1,"Bottle.  Straw coloured with sweet pear, wood and some sourness.  Flavours are pear juice, initially sweet followed by lots of dry woodines that sucks all the moisture from the palate.  Not an unpleasant experience - a decent traditional perry.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
