540,"2017-06-12",3.9,"Bottle from Jax Beer & Wine in Cumming, GA. Aroma is sweet pumpkin pie with dark chocolate, spiced pumpkin syrup, sweet potato brownies. Taste is creamy chocolate pumpkin with some spiced earthiness (but Im not getting a ton of the pepper spice). Pretty good but I was expecting something a little more jacked up.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"

540,"2016-12-26",4.4,"Bottle from Wicked Weed. Pours Coca Cola brown with a khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Nice mix of pumpkin, chile, oak, Bourbon, and chocolate. All of those flavors are there on the tongue. The heat of the chiles balances well with the bourbon and cocoa. Hides its booze well. Finished nice.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
540,"2016-12-22",4.0,"12.7 ounce bottle - Sherlocks (Kennesaw) in Marietta, Georgia.

Date Bottled: 08.03.16

Appearance: Pours a ruddy brown body with a very, very thin, light beige head.

Smell: Big on the bourbon, big on the chocolate with some booze-soaked spices (mainly cinnamon) and a bit of the peppers.

Taste: Chocolaty nibs dunked in simple syrup with a noted sweetness upfront gives way to bourbon-basted, charred-up oak, toasted chiles (less vegetal than the standard Xibalba) and some cinnamon and vanilla sugar. Warming alcohol character. Finishes fairly sweet with lingering chocolate-bourbon and just a faint, faint, faint hint of heat.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Lightly carbonated.

Overall: It all melds together nicely. A real sweet, slow-sipper of a beer. The original was fine, a bit of a clodhopper, really, but this was a nice step up.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

540,"2016-10-31",3.8,"375 ml bottle. Bottled on 08/30/16. (Wilburs Total Beverage) Ft Collins, CO.
Halloween rooftop rating session in the dark. Chicago, IL. 
Clear dark reddish brown color with a small bubbly head. 
Sweetness, Bourbon, mild vegetables, sweet malt, spices and a touch of chili in the aroma. The flavor is spices, pumpkin, sweet malt, Bourbon, vanilla, mild cacao and a tiny touch of chili. Super balanced. One of the best pumpkin beers ever. I would have enjoyed a bit more chili but thats just me... I love chili. On the other hand it wouldve ruined the balance... probably.","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"
540,"2016-10-31",4.4,"Can you think of a better beer to have on Halloween? Pours translucent cola brown with a thin but serviceable light tan head. Aroma delights with roasted malt, peppery, cocoa, cloves, cinnamon and bourbon tones. Flavor features roast malt, smoky, bourbon, woody, pepper, pumpkin, cocoa and spicy tones, adding up to a wicked good brew. Body is OK, but fizz is strong, and finish has many tasty fall tones. Hell of a good beer!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
540,"2016-10-30",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2016 Pours a deep brown from the bottle with thin ring of bubbly tan head. Aroma of big barrel notes, vanilla and charred oak, over nice fall spice blend. Taste follows, booze is mild, spice comes through more than I thought it would, hints of chocolate. Really better than I expected. A bit pricey for the 375 mL bottle though.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
540,"2016-10-26",4.6,"Deep dark Amber/Chestnut hued with no head. Sumptuous nose of woody bourbon barrel and pumpkin and clove and light cinnamon and a touch of green pepper. Lovely brown sugary flavor thats woody and bourbonny and boozy and pumpkiny with clove and allspice and a gentle pepppry heat, and a cool woody bourbon calming boozy finish. Amazing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
540,"2016-10-17",3.4,"375 mL bottle. Pours an unexpectedly deep brown. No head. Smells of bourbon, cinnamon, and chilies. Tastes of sweetness and some chocolate. Strong cinnamon. Bourbon and vanilla. Cinnamon and peppers in the finish. Medium heavy. Medium high carbonation. Tingly from either carbonation or booze. As with most pumpkin beers, this tastes mostly like the adjuncts.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
540,"2016-10-14",4.3,"Significantly darker brown than the base. Nose and flavor dominated by the barrel. Smells and tastes absolutely fantastic, but also covers up the awesome complexity and most of the pumpkin of the base beer. So as a beer, just as delicious. Just for different reasons.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
540,"2016-10-13",4.2,"375 ml. bottled 08.30.2016. Mostly clear and deep brown with a reddish tint. Soda pop head sizzles away almost immediately. Nose of whiskey, vanilla, raisin, dark cherry, chocolate and thankfully only a hint of pumpkin spice mix. The taste has all the same plus some tingly earthy pepper and a touch of wood. Medium-plus body has a smooth low-medium fizz. The barrel, chiles and cacao are used in the proper proportions to create a nice balance for such a big malty brew. Just a touch of the abv also helps thin the body a bit. Havent had the beer underneath the barreling, but in this one the spice mix is really muted and thats a good thing.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

540,"2016-10-05",4.0,"375 ml bottle from Mr. Bs Wine & Spirits for $12.99. Dark brown appearance with a small head. Aroma of oak, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, toffee and light spicy chile peppers. Similar flavor, a rich and malty barrel aged beer with hints of bourbon and spice. The pumpkin and fall spices seem to be minimal. Medium to full body with a soft, creamy feel and a lingering chocolaty and light spicy finish. A nice sipper overall.
