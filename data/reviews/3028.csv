Its a murky, caramel brown topped by a slightly off white, soft soapy head. It leaves an abundant, messy lace, and retains a soapy thick ring with a messy, creamy surface. The taste is a medium high sweet with a medium high bitter backend; nicely balanced. The beer is smooth and viscous -  syrupy - with a foamy carbonation. The medium full body is citrus upfront with a spice and pine zing to it. More caramel malt shows up late in the bottle, and it finishes with citrus zest - notably grapefruit - and a clean, spice and resin quality.

The hops are present, especially their bitterness, but theyre well balanced by the massive malt backbone. Sweet, citrusy, and caramel, all at once. a very nice complexity that kept the beer from just coming across as a DIPA. Thinner body than I expected, but it worked well. ABV not even noticeable.

3028,"2014-04-21",4.0,"22oz bottle with purple/lavender wax. 2011? 
Aroma is full of caramel notes with some toasted bread, toffee and a light roast character. Some burnt sugar and hints of honey. Light citrus and pine hoppiness, but the hops have mostly faded. Light alcohol spice. 
Pours a somewhat cloudy, copper and amber with a small tan head that quickly disappears. Faint lacing and long legs. 
Flavor has a moderate sweetness with lots of caramel and toffee. Some light treacle notes. Moderate toasted bread and nuttiness. Hints of roast and smoke. Moderate bitterness with light citrus and pine resin; again the hops have really faded. Light honey notes in the finish along with hints of alcohol spice. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a really nice barleywine that has asked really well. I like the way the malt character had integrated and the heart had faded. Im not a fan of super hoppy barleywines so the she had helped in that way too. Oxidation is only showing hints of honey.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

This has been sitting in my pantry for some time, and I was waiting for a special occasion to drink it, but fuck that. This poured out leathery brown in color. It had a huge caramel malt bouquet, with a subdued pine hop aroma. A pungent booze aroma leaped out, and made this nearly cloying. Sometimes, too much of something is not a good thing. The flavor was more of the same - booze, caramel malt, pine hop. Rather messy, in my opinion. It seems as though its just trying to be bold, and big, without being harmonized. Im glad to have finally tried this, but I cant say that this stood out as one of the top barley wines Ive ever tried.

3028,"2013-02-20",3.9,"22 ounce bottle, orange wax sealed for the 2012-2013 season, shared and sampled among 5 people. Big pine aroma, bitter hop scents jump out of the glass upon pouring it out. Appearance is a bright orange with sparkling carbonation and a good head of white foam on top. The appearance of the label art is eye catching too. Is that...barrel seed splurging out from the labels top right graphic? Taste is a fully blown palate sizzler comprised of pine, orange, grapefruit, cookies, and a touch of malted liquor sweetness. Palate is medium bodied, bubbly, and big enough to draw out the flavor dynamic. Overall, this one probably could have used some aging, although Ive heard that Behemoth is best consumed soon after being brewed. While this is an excellent beer, I couldnt help but think that the flavors just werent ripe enough yet, and without any aging it was greener, harsher, and boozier than it would be under better conditioning.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

A: Pours a clear mahogany with dark amber hues around the edges where the light hits it. One finger, off-white head forms on the pour and leaves some great lacing on the way down.

S: Im picking up some tropical fruits and some candied sugars. Very sweet. There is a slight sweet toffee malt as well floating in the background.

T: Sweet sugars up front with a light caramel malt backbone. The hops pop back up again, but this time they give a little bit of bitterness to counter the sweetness. There is a little alcohol presence on the finish with a slight warming on the way down. This definitely tastes more like a huge DIPA with more malt.

3028,"2012-08-12",4.5,"I received a 2011 vintage (yellow wax) in a trade with a friend from Ohio (thanks, Max!). I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Honey/caramel hue; opaque body; forms a large, dark khaki, frothy head which leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass. 

Smell: Very herbal nose with confectionary sweetness and distinct pine hops. No alcohol presence.

Taste: The barleywine style tends to be a bit of a double-edged sword. Great taste but low drinkability. That was my expectation going into Three Floyds Behemoth Barleywine (I mean its right there in the name). But one sip into it and I realized this wasnt a beast after all. Much like the nose and appearance, the palate begins with a light tea-like sweetness. Ive encountered this flavor in lighter beers before, but never in a barleywine.

 Sweet, syrup-tasting flavors of caramel and toffee become very predominant through the middle. But riding shotgun throughout the entire palate is a distinct piney hop bitterness. Strong enough to let you know its there, but not to the point where this could be considered an imperial IPA. Its much more of a sweet beer than it is bitter, but the inclusion of the hops without going overboard is pretty amazing. The absolute lack of alcohol is quite impressive as well. Mostly I enjoy the iced tea-like flavor throughout the entire swig. A delicious beer to say the least and unlike any other American barleywine Ive ever had - and the best to date, by the way.

Drinkability: With a name like ""Behemoth Barleywine"" you go into this beer with an expectation of booziness and unbridled energy. The fact this beer is not only drinkable, but highly so, is nothing short of amazing. At 10.5% ABV theres definitely some warmth to the palate, but nothing ridiculous. The aftertaste is an interesting mix of piney hops and candy sweetness. Slightly dry, slightly sweet, but never annoying. I was able to drink the entire 22oz bottle myself (outside on a hot summer afternoon I might add) no problem. Theres no reason to be intimidated by this one.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

A: The label art is outrageous and awesome, as is typical of any FFF beer. The beer appears mostly clear and is dark orange in color. The head is off-white and leaves a good amount of lacing upon the glass.

T: Behemoth is very hop forward, with a heavy alcohol and pine resin presence. The alcohol content is subdued to a certain degree by the huge hop aroma. Though the beer possesses a healthy malt bill, this barleywine is more hop forward than many other examples of the style.

M: The feel is medium-bodied with a lingering sticky pine aftertaste.

D: Best enjoyed in small quantities, this is a great bottle to share a few ways.

Serving type: bottle

Blonde? Maybe a real dirty blonde. Pours a bright amber - pretty much exactly the color of the amber that the mosquito was preserved in from the first Jurassic Park movie.

Definitely a substantial hop presence... hops, then some malty bits, then a booze burn that dries things up. In my mind, the taste of this thing borders a big old IIPA. Enough hops to satisfy a non-barleywine drinker I think.

The taste was sweetly bitter with hints of caramel and dark fruit early on and then progressed into a more pronounced bitterness and mildly acidic with a strong hoppy citrus note and a decent alcohol finish.

Aroma: The nose is a nice combination of caramel malts and  grapefruit, floral and resiny hops

Appearance: It pours an unclear dark orange-red color with a small off-white head and spotty lacing

Flavor: It has a big malty presence with a nice juicy/caramel sweetness, and a big heavy hop presence too

Palate: The body is full, with a thick, smooth, and creamy feel, a soft carbonation, and a lengthy duration.  Somehow it clocks in at over 10%, without having any heat.  It is both scarily and dangerously drinkable.

3028,"2012-03-01",3.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/26/2011.  Served on tap in a tulip at Three Floyds.

This pours a turbid amber brown color with a modest eggshell colored head, which fades to a ring and leaves a smattering of lace.

Behemoth is a heavily hopped barleywine, for sure. Honey and caramel sweetness combine with floral and citrus hops. Soft booze in the background. Three Floyds has the scary ability to hide the booze in these 10% beers.

The taste starts sweet, but the alcohol is already present. Caramel provides most of the sweetness, with caramel and pale malts providing a nice backbone. The hops are mostly floral, with some citrus and light pine. A pretty big hop bill overall. Right now, I think I had to take off just a little since the flavor is good, but not that complex and a little raw.

Sticky sweet mouthfeel, with fuller than medium carbonation. The body is anything but behemoth, especially for the style and ABV. A very juicy feel.

Aroma is beautiful with buckets of American hops with aromas of pineapple and citrus. Then a gracious malt complexity of caramel, raisins and dates. Hints of passion fruit and fresh pie crust. Exactly what an American barleyed wine should smell like. The taste is very bitter and hoppy, but also has the same lovely malt profile. Raisins and figs - but not in a vulgar way that other barley wines have - its held back and subtle, yet present and perplexing.

The hops are there for sure, but do not dominate.  Instead they add a nice citrussy brightness to the beer.  Thereslenty of malt as expected to hold it together and give a good mouthfeel.

3028,"2012-01-20",3.7,"Poured into a snifter. This is the super rare Ohio-only 2011 edition. 

4.0 A: Clear dark orange/amber color. Two fingers of creamy beige head. Retention is good for a brew of this magnitude and a good bit of semi-regular lacing is left.

4.0 S: This is a damn hoppy barleywine. You could call this a DIPA if you wanted to and get away with it. Hops give off a lot of tropical fruit with emphasis on orange and papaya, a touch of pine, and a pleasant herbalness. The malts offer plenty of peach and nectarine fruitiness, moderate caramel, and some neutral malty sweetness. To be honest, this shares a lot of traits with aged Nugget Nectar if it was able to hold onto its hoppiness.

4.0 T: Again, quite hoppy and probably closer to a malty DIPA than a hoppy barleywine. Tropical fruits again and this time pineapple joins the party. Mild to moderate bitterness. Herbalness and pine. Caramel, some toffee, and plenty of neutral, somewhat bready malty sweetness. Booze is apparent, but its not hot.

4.0 M: Heavier medium to lighter full body. Good moderate carbonation. A bit sticky, which I attribute mainly to the hops. Reasonably creamy and smooth.

4.0 D: Good, hoppy barleywine. At $16 per bottle, this is a very rare treat at best, but Im still going to buy a bottle for the cellar. Im quite curious to see what happens when the hops fade.

Pours orange with lasting beige head. Very piney, bery grape fruity nose.
Taste is wonderfull. The same hoppyness. Almost liquor-like herbal taste that ends very bitter and very long.
Apart from the hoppy stuff, malty stuff kicks in as well.
Some bread and oranges. Sweetness is there but never cloying.
This is actually how I prefer my IIPA:-)
On the hoppy side but with a solid malty base.
Fantastic barley wine bordering on IIPA.
There is a herbal note that I cannot nail. I guess it is from the hops?
In no way alcoholic.

3028,"2011-03-31",4.2,"2010 vintage shared by the other Matt, thanks Huhzubendah.

Beer is surprisingly yellow (although upon closer examination it is called BLONDE, Im not smart) with moderate to low carbonation and a thin white head of small and medium bubbles, not much lacing.

For a barelywine, it is quite hop forward, lots of resiny piny hop flavors in the nose...earthy at times too. I can pick up the malt but this is a hop bomb.

The leadoff here is alcohol and sweetness giving way in the midpalate to the pine hops. The hops are strong in flavor and force the palate to experience them, burying the alcohol significantly. I suppose this is one strategy to cover up alcohol, I wonder how this ages.

Pours into my snifter a deep red with hints of rose. Th head is large and froth and off-white. It recedes with very nice lacing.

This one still smells hoppier than hell, which is why I decided to try it now, Thre Floyds is all about the hops and I wanted to catch em fresh. Underneath the piney, slightly citrusy, maybe some tropics, hops there is a thick maltfest. It hasnt matured beyond a fresh, hoppy dipa scent yet.

The taste itself it hugely malty but with a nice hop bitterness and resinous pine flavors. But the malt shines in the taste. There are hints of caramel, brown sugar, oxidised apple, and scotch, never cloying but supremely decadent. The alcohol is present but not overbearing. 

The mouthfeel is syrupy thick though decently carbonated. It is ever so slightly cloying I guess. THe alcohol burns slightly especially int he lower throat. THe finish is somewhat dry and sticky as well. Drinkability is high, it goes down like a charm and warms the belly.

Another hit from FFF.

3028,"2011-01-11",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2011 FULL VERTICAL TASTING
651mL 2005 pink wax. Somehow this has held up extremely well and is by far the best of the flight. The pour, like almost all the Behemoths is not very impressive- clear, deep amber with a thinning, yellow head that sticks around very little. Aroma on the 2005 is wicked though: extreme English toffee, old English barleywine cellar notes like a Thomas Hardy. Must, cellar, port vinous character. Spicy caramel, spicy wood, and red fruits come into play as well. Excellent creamy mouthfeel. Still so much balancing spicy hops. This could age for another year or more. incredible. 8/4/8/5/16=4.1
651mL 2007 yellow wax courtesy of pittsburghkid. The 2007 is more bitter, chalky, and has dark chocolate and cocoa powder rather than English toffee and old barleywine character. It also pours a little bit lighter than the rest of the vertical. This vintage has devolved into the classic ""mint"" aroma and profile that seems to plague American barleywines. Ive seen this in Doggie Claws and Third Coast Old Ale among others where orange mint and fresh mint dominate the nose and body.
651mL 2008 purple wax courtesy of dpjuart. This one is fruity, almost fruit juicy, sweet. Just straight cherry and apple juice box. Probably the worst of the bunch. 
651mL 2009 teal wax. Poured with the best carbonation but lower SRM. The high carbonation here actually detracts a little, and the body is too dry and chalky. Flavors are spicy, boozy, sweet. 
651mL 2010 green wax courtesy of pittsburghkid. More red fruits, sweet and spicy, nice warming alcohol that is retrained. Probably the next best of the vertical. 
651mL 2011 white wax thanks to TheTomG. Pour is phenomenal: clear red ruby with a massive, yellow, creme head with infinite retention and giant sheety lace. Aroma is raspberry tea, raspberry lemonade, toffee, orange mint, plums, apricot skins, sharp brandy alcohol. Taste is massively soft with just an incredible palate: pillowy carbonation and sharp, fresh mouthfeel. Perfect palate. Taste is fruity Valencia orange, fresh citrus, very fruity and juicy, sweet grapefruit, plums, lycee. Muted, nice spicy alcohol creates depth and reminds you this is some serious business. 8/5/8/5/16=4.2
Conclusion: I would say overall that Behemoth is not the best barleywine to age as the freshest vintage was best but the 2005 has miraculously turned into something quite incredible. Very different and more barleywine like where the fresh 2011 is more like a well done DIPA.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Beautiful, vibrant pineapple, grapefruit rind, heavy resinous hops, and burnt caramel. Heavy hop aroma on the nose. BBB is big. Barleywines are hit-or-miss for me and this one is killer.

Loads of fresh tropical fruit like mango, melon, and other fruits, piney bitter hops balance perfectly, and lead to sweet caramel towards the finish, with the alcohol not all that detectable.

Not as thick as your typical barley wine, but packed with Three Floyds trademark crystal hops, caramel, and a fantastic citrus note from the fruits.  Amarillo hops and the fruits create an outstanding citrus element that balances out the malts and barley.  The flavors and potency of this beer increases dramatically as it warms.

The head was modest, off white foam that reduced rather quickly to a small ring and film, leaving some streaks of lacing. The aroma was citrus as ruby-grapefruit and orange, strong resin, a touch of litter box to get my attention, rich malt and mid-fruit sweetness, and the presence of alcohol.

The smell was sweet, a little hoppy with caramel notes. The taste was amazing. Citrus, caramel, pine, syrup. This was like nectar! This may be the best barleywine I have ever had just barely beating the Old Ruffian on cask. Alcohol was well masked but the mouthfeel had a little astringency. Not an every day beer but for my birthday it was perfect.

1/13/08 2007 vintage was not as good as it was fresh (see above) syrupy and still had a nice fruitiness but makes me wonder about how this beer will do with age....

Reddish copper color with a slight chill hazy. A small off-white head with yellow hues settles rather quickly and leaves some lacings.

Plenty of hops in the smell - big notes of grapefruit and small hints of strawberries. Grass, floral notes and a general fruitiness. Sweet malts with a slightly bready character, fudge, nutty aromas and brown sugar. Incredibly well balanced. Great smell.

The taste is fantastic. Great balance between sweet malts and fresh hop aromas. Notes of grapefruit, strawberries, mango and cherries blend with pine-needles, floral notes and hop resins. A thick and very pleasant malty backbone with a somewhat toasty character - dark bread, nuts, chocolate and huge amount of sweet caramel. The finish is really bitter and contains fresh hop resins, a hint of tobacco, wood and gentle spices. The bitterness slowly fades away in a really long finish. A sweet taste of alcohol is noticeable, but its really integrated with the rest of the flavors.

Full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation.

A very good beer. Its almost unbelievable to think a beer as potent as this one can be so balanced, its practically flawless. Rich, powerful and complex, it doesnt get much better than that.

Left finishing deliciously with only a mild bitterness and the toasted caramel as well. I loved this and it is one of the best barleywines I have ever had. Worth the nearly $20 price.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

3028,"2009-07-11",4.0,"22oz blue wax 2009 bottle purchased at DLD 09. Pours a clear, amber-orange body with a thin, white head that leaves a good amount of whispy lacing on the surface and the glass. A simple swirl arouses the head easily. Aroma is big on the floral hops with some resins and sweet pines. Lots of caramels and a soft molasses. Big citrus, mostly grapefruit and tangerines, as well as a hint of berry raisin. Extremely hoppy aroma. Flavor is no different. Starts with a soft caramel sweetness before the pines and florals grab the attention. The cool thing about this is that hops dont attack the palate even though they are pretty intense, but rather walk proudly with their chests thrusting and their egos high. Some more sweet caramels as well as a mixture of fruit join the parade before some molasses, honey, and peppery spicing ends this one all the while being led by a high amount of pines. Finishes very dry and grassy with a slight cloy. Lots of grassy, syrupy bitterness in the aftertaste with a deeper caramel and light alcoholic warmth. Palate is medium bodied and slightly sticky with a touch of carbonation. Overall, this is an extremely hoppy barley wine. Ive never had anything like it. Personally, I feel that the intense floral and pine flavors take away some of the stylistic qualities that I tend to like in a barley wine, but this is still damn good, especially the aroma. Props to FFF for balancing a ""behemoth"" like this.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3028,"2009-07-09",4.4,"Original review date 10/27/2008...

Cloudy, caramel bourbon color. Dry ginger head shows for a few minutes and is off. Lacing is moderate with a few sediment lines.

Wow - smells like hoppy French toast! Maple syrup, caramel, salt, vanilla - hops have some subdued citrus and maybe a little grass. Bitterness is profound even though traditional hop elements may be tempered. With warmth hop character becomes more lightly floral absent any perfume.

This is a cinder block to the head. Creamy caramel - even a little buttery (diacetyl?) but not offensive. Boozy floral/grass hopy...all in abundance. Stewy and soup with even a little broccoli in there. Crazy.

Tight mouth at first. With warmth of course this opens up nicely. Almost salty soup with stew over abundant malt. Boozy to an extent but oh so comfortably warming.

Admittedly this is a sentimental favorite - this was the one that started it all - the first uber-hopped barleywine I ever came across, courtesy of the Floyd blokes at the 1999 GABF. Several years later its still boozy, heavy and hoppy as all hell...and it works! A great pleasure to savor and contemplate the rare times I get a chance to enjoy this one.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Fruity esters and piney, grapefruit hops dominate the aroma with caramel and toffee malt coming through secondarily. Flavor is primarily sweet malt- caramel toffee, fruit, and molasses. Hop backbone is quite evident with grapefruit notes culminating with a woody almost earthy note. Palate is smooth and soft, finishing fiery in the bottom of the throat. Extremely quaffable and well balanced. A lovely example of the style.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
3028,"2009-06-30",4.3,"2008 vintage. Red mahogany pour with a small, white bubbly head. Aroma is very nice; caramel, apricot, and plum mix with a nice citrusy hop aspect. Seems to be not too aggressive, more mellow despite the 12% ABV. Flavor definitely conveys more of an American than English barleywine style; rich citrus hop presence combines with the fruity malt character, and the alcohol burn at the end is extraordinary.

3028,"2009-04-15",3.5,"Blue wax.  Purchased at Lakeview Binnys.  Its aight.  Pretty light bodied for a 12% barley wine, this had none of the malty fullness and richness I like in my barley wines -- its pretty much a hoppy american strong.  Nice billowing ""racing"" and sudsy sparce lacing with a head that mostly dissipates over a dark amber beer.  Theres some sweet golden raisin on the nose (much more than in the mouth), accented by floral and oily hops.  Caramel sweetness in the mouth is dark and not too distinct, mostly acting as a nondescript baseline around which the hops play, sometimes juicy, always bitter.  Not a bad beer at all, but my barley wine tastes are fairly specific, and this doesnt push the right buttons for me (I dont know why I rate barley wines more ""to style"" than any other style, but I do -- and by ""to style"" I mean ""to what I want it to be"").","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

3028,"2009-02-13",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2009 In short: An unusually refreshing fruity  and hoppy Barley Wine.  Could almost pass as a big Double IPA.  Excellent
How: Bottle 22oz.  2008 batch (purple wax), purchased at the brewery and consumed when 8 months of age
The look: Cloudy dark orange body topped by a persistent medium white head
In long: The pleasantly hoppy nose is unusual for a barley wine with notes of clementines, resin and caramel.  Taste is really smooth and refreshing despite the gravity.  Body is full and pillowy with a soft carbonation.  A lot of juicy fruity caramel.  Dried fruits, apricots, tangerines, citrus fruits, tropical fruits, even pineapples.  Juicy resinous leafy hops almost balance the whole thing out leaving a little residual sugar in the finish.  Blind tasting I would have called it an IIPA.  Turn that little residual sugar in rich caramel and this would be perfect.  Amazingly drinkable, this has got to be the most refreshing barley wine Ive ever had.  And when talking about a Barley Wine refreshing is a word I use as rarely as please and thank-you in my day-to-day life.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The flavor is like the style with a bitter finish and very well hidden alcohol. The palate is appropriate for the style. Overall its a good example of the style. Actually its got some qualities that I wish other would have but I could do without the carrot taste.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"

Not the most complex of brews, in fact it’s a rather basic big malt big hops type thing but there is enough fruity character to add some interest. Somehow the alcohol remains very well behaved too. Very good stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

This barley wine is extremely well balanced and is a pure pleasure to drink.  It has a nice medium body with the hops taking over on top while the sides are fuller and full of malts.

The head is very dense with tiny bubbles - perfect.  I can actually smell this brew from my glass across the counter.  It has an amazing and potent aroma that includes doughy and biscuity malt, grapefruit hops, and cherries beneath Christmas cake.  Stunning.  The flavor has a lot going on, lacks any flaw characteristics, and does not include nearly as much alcohol flavor as the abv. would suggest.  And, the alcohol flavor is like that of a complex whiskey or red wine and exhibits a perfect warming characteristic.  Other flavors include caramel, dough, hop bitterness on the front and juicy grapefruit hops on the finish.  Unbelievable.  The brew gets sweeter as it warms, bit still does not prove to be overly sweet - literally a perfect balance.  Also, again, as it gets warmer, a refreshing pine hop character begins protrude through the other flavors.    Brews only gets 5 for palate from me if they are very thick, full bodied, coating, and smooth, as this brew is.  Overall: the name Behemoth is perfectly fitting because this is a monster of a brew.  To me it represents a perfect example of the Barley Wine style.  I would have probably given this brew a 5 if I could bring myself to give a beer a 5 out of 5.  The price might scare you (16 dollars per bomber at a the store I bought it at, 22 dollars at the pub I work at), but it is worth every penny of that price, and more.

The initial flavour is of sweet caramel with tart kiwi and grapefruit. As the brew begins the pass the tongue, the hops begin to become a little more apparent. Pine and some light bitterness starts to kick in. But the intense maltiness of this beer holds back the massive amount of hops, balancing the usually abrasive qualities.

Like I said this is a thick and viscous brew with creamy carbonation. Bacon fat  decadence, chewy caramel from a candy bar, aged citrus meat, old boot leather. This brew is surprisingly balanced. I cant believe I said that. The finish has a strong peach pit bittering component that digs in quietly and is only revealed after the medicine goes down.

3028,"2008-05-04",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2008 Bottle: 2008.
Appearance: amber copper to mahogany color. Little and beige head.
Aroma: an incredible, exquisite, lasting and complex hoppy aroma (although some rare for a barley wine) with notes of menthol, eucalyptus, pine, herbs, cedar, mints, etcMalty and complex fruity smells like figs and plums in liquor. Liquory touches similar to cognac and whisky. Others floral aromas like chamomile.
Flavor: ephemeral malty start. Exquisite, resinous, intensive, lasting and complex hoppy taste with grass, mints, eucalyptuses and pine reminiscences. Alcoholic dry notes like bitter-liquor and bitter-Araucano; also, other sweet liquor reminiscences like cognac and whisky. Bitter-fruitiness like stone-peaches and peel-grapefruit and sweet-fruitiness similar to oranges, pink-grapefruit, peaches, mangos and papayas. Light spicy touches like cinnamon, nutmeg, red-tea and chamomile. I havent more words for describe this marvel taste.
Palate: medium body, smooth texture and light carbonation.
Remark: incredible aroma and taste, with own-character, complex hoppyness, etc... I believe that this beer is a new sub-style beer, maybe a hoppy-barley-wine.

Pours a slightly hazy bold amber color. Head is medium to small, off-white and diminishes rather slowly, leaving a film and a thicker lace around.
Aroma is initially very hoppy, intense and powerful with a perfumey character. Notes of rhubarb, cedar, maple wood, straw. Big flowery notes come afterwards accompanied by piney, resinous touches, cherries and a huge backbone of caramel malt. Enticing. This cant be bad.
Intense, strong flavor, surprisingly well balanced between malty and hoppy profiles. It feels initially bitter with quite a lot of IBUs, but each sip reveals new things. Oh, its so complex! Cognac, unblended scotch Whisky, fruity liquors and digestivs. In the back, huge amounts of cereals, caramel, peanuts, nougat and even some tropical fruit salads. Mango, Guayabas... I feel like in Easter Island again. The finish is so intense it overwhelms your entire body.
The body of the beer is huge, feeling like a dense syrup. Full mouthfeel with low to mid carbonation. Good alcoholic presence with a punch that warms you. You could drink this naked in Alaska and you woulnt feel the cold. The aftertaste is godly and lingers forever. I drank this yesterday and I still feel it.

After cracking the yellow wax and pouring this one into my Hennepin glass, I was mostly relieved. A relatively dark pour - gleaming amber with a fairly lively head - and a big floral aroma are both promising. Theres a deep boozy quality to this one still, backed up by a hop profile thats aggressive (man, if its this way after this long I have to try it fresh) and locked in combat with the thick malts. Lots of fruits, both tropical and autumnal, in the flavor and the full body contributes to a long and complex finish. Not quite what Id hoped for, but quite good nonetheless.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

3028,"2008-03-26",4.5,"Bottled in 2005: I purchased this at the brewery for $180 a case. I have poured it into a tulip. The slight head quickly fades. The body is a clear amber. 

When I was at the brewery yesterday, a lady popped one of these, and poured it into a glass. I kid you not, I smelled this thing from 5 feet away. We were standing in the brewery, with all kinds of other smells, yet this stood above them all. The nose is of cherries and pineapples, with a nutty, malty backbone. The alcohol is definitely noticeable. 

The taste is fu!@#ing huge! The hops are running wild up front. Orange, pineapple, this hop profile could only be pulled off by Nick Floyd. The hops seem to be sweet instead of bitter. They leave an oil slick on my tongue. The malt side has molasses, toffee, and cherries. There is also a nutty, doughy, bready character as well. This is like a big, juicy, alcoholic grapefruit. 

The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It is certainly coating. The drinkability is better than average, but the acidity of this prevents me from having another one, for now. I have plenty for later.

3028,"2008-02-16",4.0,"Poured into a snifter, appears a deep thick coppery color. Fine carbonation slowly fights through the thick body and forms a creamy head that dissipates more quickly than it forms, leaving wispy film and bubbles.

Smells of rich deep malt, full of caramel and roastiness, topped by some hoppy brighter fruit scents. Overall characterized by the toasted bready, lightly sweetened malt. Hints of clover, honey, and alcohol.

Taste brims with full on malt characteristics of caramel and roasted grains. Slight nutty and floral notes emerge and pause momentarily with a thin sugary stickiness, then dissolve into clearly defined hop character stacked with pine, resin, and crisp grapefruit, cresting with a pointed bitterness that rises from the tongue and floods the mouth. Final notes of resinous hops, juicy fruits, and yeasty toasted bread soften slowly into a slightly smoky grainy aftertaste.

Palate is a struggle between the thick body and tight carbonation, yielding a full feel with flavors released slowly by the escaping bubbles. Smooth, sticky, and resinous are all excellent descriptors, with the feel progressing parallel to flavor with each sip.

With a notable Three Floyds flavor profile, this full bodied barleywine is a journey of hop and malt flavors. Overall character is abstruse, with a great individuality of style offset by a heavy body and ever present 12.5%abv. I struggled with this review, finally deciding that this beer is simply a dichotomy of all that makes beer what it is. Tensions emerge between hop/malt, body/carbonation, and flavor/consumption.

3028,"2008-01-31",4.2,"2005 pink wax version.  Poured a dark amber with a small fizzy off-white head.  Rich and sweet aroma of caramel, molasses, strawberry jam and some ruby red grapefruit.  Flavor is rich and sweet with notes of molasses and brown sugar, toffee, some light strawberry, some citrus zest, a dash of bitter grapefruit rind.  Hops here mostly in the form of a bit of bitter dryness that becomes more apparent towards the finish.  Slight alcohol warmth does little to betray the strength of the beer.  Contrary to the brewerys slogan of ""Its not normal,"" I find this to be a fairly straight-shooting barley wine that is well crafted, to style, and without any noticeable flaws.  As a matter of preference, I would have liked a bit more hoppy citrus to go with the hoppy dryness, as I enjoy barley wines that either go all the way as American or English, and at the moment this one seems to be riding the fencepost.  However, this is of course exquisitely made.  A dangerously drinkable concoction that represents a very intelligent and sophisticated take on the style.

3028,"2008-01-16",3.7,"22oz. bomber, 2005 (pink wax), courtesy of CaptainCougar. Pours a very cloudy, thick, deep, red with brown and orange highlights. The yeast that make it into the bottle look like flakes of cork. A head is stirred up - medium in size and tan in color - but quickly subsides to nearly nothing. The aroma is hoppy and malty with tons of caramel. The grassy hops and caramel are primary smells, and dark fruit and alcohol are secondary. There is a slight medicinal quality to its strong alcoholic character. Tertiary smells are a light dustiness and a subtle hint of smoke. The flavor starts quite lovely and complex: thick and malty with lots of toffee and caramel and hints of honey and chocolate. There is also a very firm hop note that is very piney. As the beer goes back towards mid-palate, the bitter hops strengthen - piney and resiny (with a growing astringency that is reminiscent of nail polish). The malt character continues to balance and overcome the hops - loads of caramel and a growing level of chocolate. By mid-tongue, the malt profile gets more and more like fruit-cake. The finish is surprisingly somewhat dry from the bitterness and from a subtle smoke flavor. It finishes quite bittersweet with the astringency lessening, but the warmth/heat of alcohol growing. The back of the throat is quite warm from alcohol after swallowing. The mouthfeel is very full and carbonation is low. It isnt quite syrupy, but it is thick. Overall, a very interesting barley wine.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

So NYE was the winning day (well, evening) and it was a fantastic beer. It pours out a dark amber, almost brown color, cloudy with a good sized two finger head. Aroma is catty, some piney and citrusy hops, alcohol, honeyish malts, a touch of old bubblegum and herbaceous. Mouthfeel is full bodied, coating and a touch hot. Flavors bring out notes of pine, chewey caramel, and light tropical fruit. Having a couple of years on this beer seems to really have mellowed many of the flavors and everything meshed together incredibly well.

1/02/2008:  Three Floyds Behemoth Barleywine is a MASSIVE beer!  It pours a thick, cloudy honey-amber color.  There is a quickly dissipating ivory head, but there is still lots of carbonation.  Tons of orange and citrus hops combine with sweet, rich, caramel malt in the aroma.  TONS of rich caramel malt assault the tastebuds and then a nice, even, integrated orangy-citrus bitterness sneaks in before the sugary malt finish.  There is a touch of alcohol in through the nose.  This full-bodied beer is sticky and creamy on the palate.  This beer is doing excellent for 2 (going on 3) years and shows no signs of oxidation.

Flavor:  Bright pine and spruce flavor; caramel-toffee maltiness; ample bitterness without being over the top; very well-balanced; alcohol is quite subdued.  Palate:  Medium-full; smooth and slick.  Overall:  Fruity hop flavors and characteristics dominate begging the question, ""Is it an American-style Barleywine or an Imperial IPA?""  I like it, but it is less barleywine, more IIPA, and NOT Behemoth as I originally knew it to be...

22 fl. oz. bottle shared by Rob.  Score:  7/3/8/4/17 = 3.9

11/02/2014:  3F Behemoth 2007 Vintage (Yellow Wax)...  Dwindling quickly - DRINK NOW!  Not much left there except some well-aged maltiness.  The hops have all but faded.  This is still a good beer to sip, but its mostly candy maltiness with a bit of vanilla in the background.  This beer has aged well enough and is enjoyable, but isnt anything like it was or nearly as good as 0-3 years old. Id give this a 3.6 or 3.7 at this point.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

3028,"2008-01-02",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2008 Yellow Wax / 07 bottle. Pours a nice copper amber color. Tiny acidic head that quickly turns to just a slick on the surface of the beer. Smells of sugar, hops, malt, a just a bit of bread. Tastes very thick in the mouth feel like syrup on the tongue and the alcohol presence is totally absent. Taste is fruity, dark fruits, hop oil, and caramel. Truly a terrific barley wine, I don’t have the best descrption.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
3028,"2007-12-29",3.9,"Provided by Alldaydrinker; Jeff, youre the man. Pours a hazy transluscent orange with a short-lived off-white head. Intense, stinging nose of high-alpha and earthy hops, barley, alcohol, butterscotch, and port with resin and herbal notes. The initial flavours of herbal, resin-like hops and peppery, alcohol spice differs greatly from the finish and aftertaste. The finish is mostly chewy caramel and orange citrus. The balance here is incredible, but the complexity is low. I was expecting more of a NW hop profile with brutal bitterness, but what I got was a pleasant, balanced brew that highlighted hop flavour over hop sting; a nice surprise. This is a nice barleywine, but I feel it is overrated and over-hyped. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy with gentle carbonation and a high alcohol presence.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"
3028,"2007-12-29",4.1,"Once dumped into a snifter it had a merky and cloudy orange amber color, with some minor laceing and there was no head at all, but the beer was a little bit opaque. It has a really strong aroma with rich hops and caramle malt that really stings your nose when you put it to the glass and take a sniff. As it warmed up and i took my first sip you could really taste the citrus hops and there was a nice pepper like bitterness on the tip of your tounge. The more i drink it it mellowed out and the caramel really comes out with the presance of booze.","Bristol, Rhode Island, USA","emerica56"
3028,"2007-12-29",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2007 2007 Bottle Release Bomber Pours a murky amber colour with a small off white that diminished to a ring. Nose of dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar and touch hop character. Initial taste of caramel and toffee overlay that is chewy touched my bitter hops that swarm the sides the mouth. As warmed alcohol becomes more present and is definitely a backbone of the beer. Moving into a mid palate of resin and smokey hints. Finishing with a spicy mouthful. Good palate duration. Sticky lips and mouthfeel. Medium body. Good head retention and lacing of the glass.","Norwood, Massachusetts, USA","Alldaydrinker"
3028,"2007-12-23",4.2,"In July I bought this (with a few other Three Floyds) while visiting friends in Indiana. Since then, Ive been waiting for someone to share it with. Some friends wanted to drink their homebrew (which was great). Some brought me another barley wine (so we drank that). Finally, with the season upon us, I opened the Three Floyds. The alcohol is strong. The malts rich. The sweetness is subtle. But its strong. Much stronger then, lets say, Lagunitas Brown Sugga. But not as kick ass as Bells Third Coast. Worth the wait, but I wish I was sharing. The wife cant stand barley wines.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
3028,"2007-12-23",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2007 Shared at Lava Lounge, thanks to hero27. Beer pours a very deep ruby red as described on the bottle, excellant lacing. This is very hoppy as you might expect from an American barley wine, but there is a strong pineapple aroma as well as plum and dark fruits. Taste is much like the aroma with a strong hop and pineapple presence paired with a nice bit of alcohol warmth. Did I say this is hoppy? Mouthfeel is very smooth. Drinkable, yes, but limit how much you have. I would definately like to see this beer after a year or two of aging, cant wait to see what else is in store for this, enjoy.

Dec. 29, 2007 Review.  Dark pink wax, purchased from Brewpub in Jan. 2007.

Perfectly clear ruby red color.  Off-white head that retains well and leaves bits of lacing.  Sweet candi sugar in the smell, caramel, and some cherry.  The pineapple aromas seem to have fallen off almost completely.  Taste is sweet, but has some of the pineapple I remember jumping in there as well.  Slight oxidation and dark fruit flavors also come into the equation.  Sweet, pineapple like finish with an alcohol warmth to it.  Less than medium carbonation with a thicker body that somehow refuses to be cloying.  Darn good beer, but for the price I think youll be much happier with Bigfoot.

Finished thick and creamy with a nice alcohol bite.  Id like to try this fresh as well as aged for another year or two,  but this was pretty darn good.

3028,"2007-12-16",4.0,"2007 yellow wax bottle received in trade with pantanap  about 9 months ago.   Thanks Kan!  I was pretty faded when my friend Taylor convinced me to open this. I kinda was saving it for a special occasion, but then I realized I could probably easily obtain another bottle if I liked it a lot, so why not give it a try.  This was a pretty tasty bw.  Typical FFF hop character was still very noticeable, and it was balanced well with caramel malts. A big beer, alcohol noted but hidden rather well. Dont know if Id seek this out again because of the price, but it is pretty tasty.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
3028,"2007-12-14",4.3,"Poured from a 2007 vintage, yellow wax 22oz bomber and served in a snifter.  This barley wine poured a muddy brown with a decent sized head of yellowish beige foam that faded away into a thin layer of bubbles.  Beautiful, thick, heavy lacing coated the entire inside of the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of heavy notes of sugary sweet caramel, maple syrup, light pineapple, and a faint note of alcohol.  Just a wonderfully huge malty aroma!  The flavor of the beer consisted of resiny pine, thick caramel, apricot, and brown sugar.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and syrupy with just a bit more carbonation than you would expect in a beer of this viscosity, providing a lush, creamy palate.  A thoroughly enjoyable brew.  Just as the description states, sit back next to the fire, grab a cigar, and enjoy the weather!","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"
3028,"2007-12-12",4.1,"Sampled both the 05 and 06 vintages. Rating the 05 because I liked that one a bit more.

Pours a dark brown body with a surprisingly hefty head. Light tan in color, fades to a layer of foam and loose bubbles. Nose of sweet tropical fruits, caramel, toffee, pine nuts, fir trees, light hops and figs. Flavor is spot on with the aroma, sweet and lightly spicy, perfectly balanced. Medium to full bodied, heavy and coating on the palate. Long finish, sweet malts and caramel, with a faint hop bitterness. No sense of the ABV really in the aroma or the flavor, very well hidden. Warming but incredibly easy to drink for a 12% beer.

Slightly lighter in color than the older vintage. Nose is much more heavily hopped, tons more pine and fir, but still with a malt and caramel backbone that is noticeable. All other components are similar. I can see this being just as good as the 05 with similar aging to it.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"
3028,"2007-12-12",3.7,"2007 vintage courtesy of Gillard. Pours hazy copper with lasting tan head. The aroma is nice and hoppy with pine hops and fur tree followed by sweet mildly roasty malts and hints of caramel. The taste starts hoppy and earthy and a tad thin. The hops come off as pine, grassy, resiny and earthy bitterness. Wow, lots of hops. By midway the sweet malts peak in intensity but quickly get overtaken by pine and grassy hop bitterness that run right into the after taste. Darn smooth really but would benefit from several more years of aging.2005 vintage. It pours a hue darker than the 06 with an even bolder tan head. The aroma is much more barleywine like with a suitable level of dark fruity esters to break up the once hop dominated nose. I also get a just noticeable caramel note. The taste is richer with a bit more malt caramel notes and dark fruity esters. The hops are still over powering. I think this will be excellent in a couple more years. I now wish I had another bottle.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3028,"2007-12-07",3.3,"Yellow wax bottle from my secret santa. Cloudy orange with a smallish head. Aroma of caramel, brown sugar and some raisins. The hops must have died back in the aging. I taste a bit of citrus, but not the super-hoppy pine and grapefruit that I read in past reviews. A bit of an alcoholic/medicinal aftertaste when it gets closer to room temperature.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","MrBendo"
3028,"2007-12-07",4.4,"Bottle... yellow wax.  This thing has sat around very patiently waiting and its time has finally arrived.  As it pours I start to pick up some of the sweet malt aroma and a whiff of brandy-like alcohol.  Closer inspection and a little patience reveal a fairly dark brown body with some reddish highlights and a one finger tan head that has fled the scene fairly quickly.  Aromas are of brandy, wine, brown sugar and some fig and date fruit.  A touch of pine hops are there, too... This is very good, but my first thoughts are that I should have aged it a little longer to see if that hops bite would die back a bit.  It has the lovely sweet and sticky malt body, but transitions into an alcoholic warmth and a hops blast that smacks of grapefruit peels and pine needles.  This is silly good.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Nice sweet malty aromas of caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits and some light citrus hops.  Flavor has a bit of a time keeping up with the aroma; there is some presence of citrus hops, but theres an undefinable slightly harsh undertone that takes over where Id hope some maltiness would kick in.

Flavor has thick caramel malts, with lots of resiny hops that have held up well over the two years.  Has some brown sugar and vanilla stickiness, but it isnt cloying. Later flavors give off some roasted nuttiness, and a very late dark toffee hint with tons of resiny hop bitterness, which has a minty character when it warms.

3028,"2007-10-27",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2010 Yellow wax 07 bomber bottle. Pours well with a generous helping of lacing. Deep amber color. Spicy noticeable alcohol presence. Soft voluminous malts. Hops are there, but dont overpower. Seems as this has aged well, becoming a soft, easy sipping quaffer.

Soft malts and that trademark candi sugar fruitiness that I love about Three Floyds. Nice dry hop finish with just a hint of alcohol on the back of the palate. This stuff is deep, potent, and deceivingly good!","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"
3028,"2007-10-24",4.8,"Wow! Everything Id hope from Three Floyds in a Barleywine pours out just as I should have expected. Thick and vicious! Looks like caramel milk when pouring. The glass accepts the contents quickly and as it turns about in heavy thick scarvings of yellow ochre swirls and light brown whirls. It builds a lightly thick capping of foam lightly with large billowing bubbles which soap up slowly to dwindle down to its frothy middling level before finally fading to a thick whispy skim always sitting. The color finally settles a dark rusty brown with a flash of dark orange within. Fuckin Beautiful ! 

Aroma is a nice mix of highly present caramel goo mixed with a perfumed tight little sent of deep orange, deeper lemon, deepest pineapple, and some tattered pine sap thrown in. Clean, robust, and boastfully delightful on the nose. 

But oh my the taste, the taste!...remarkable delicious! Holy fuck! ...Yum! Need I say more? 




OK maybe I should try. Ummm.... how bout; Thick, sugary sweet laden caramel flavors are big and twisted upon a piney citrus juiced, flowery palate of goodness! Yet delicately woven with one melange of fun hoppiness that plants a bunch of fun and long lasting durations of slightly pithy bitterness interwoven within the thick juicy pulp of each fruit I might be able to summon in the ideas of tropical treats and freshness. Peach, nectarine, pineapple, orange, mango, lemon, tangerine, apple, red grapefruit, and a flinting of green grape. Yum! No banana Im afraid. But the the caramel sweetened firmness more than enough makes up for it. Believe me. Its Heavenly! 

The feel is thick and slippery, with a girth that stands on it own with a big, tall standing malt body made of caramel goodness and plastered with a hoppy touch of bite and bitterness that eludes the parching areas and goes right for the easy going goodness of juicy balance and alcohol. Why, because the 12.5 % is no where to be found until it hits the inside the head quickly after dispersing most of the contents of the bottle to the glass and then to the lips. No doubt. Creamy and lush, full and balanced; this stuff rocks with unbelievable drinkable ease and too much, so much so, Im uncomprehensible to the point of utmost uncomprehensiblity?!

It looks like something youd drop your $1500 watch in and say, ""Forget it.""  It smells sweet, like apricots.  It has a distinct hop spice aroma to it as well.  It smells interesting if a touch sweet for my taste.  Oh wow!  The first taste really took me by surprise.  I wasnt expecting the huge hop profile even though the liquor store guy told me this was a hop monster.  It almost made my eyes water.  Im having an extremely hard time pinpointing this one.  It has a sweet body that you have to concentrate to find.  The peppery hops dont just sit on the body but surround it like a casing and has tendrils shooting through the body like vines growing through a sidewalk.  The alcohol makes my lips tingle a bit.  The whole thing is complex and endlessly interesting.  Each sip is another chance to pinpoint the balance.  I hope the high alcohol and hop content dont overwhelm my senses before the end of the beer.  This is a beer that you can keep on stock in the ""beer cave"".  Break it out for company that appreciates fine beer.  This is a beer that begs to be shared and enjoyed and talked about.  Oh yeah, did I mention its ugly?","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MrRain"

3028,"2007-08-10",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2013 Yellow wax.  Was planning on saving this one for a while, but couldnt help myself.  Aroma a thick caramel with typical FFF grapefruit surging and pulsing along the undertow.  Ruby body, clear with slow-rising carbonation and lacing, rocky, luscious tan head.  Sweet floral notes with caramel and lots of pine, with sticky overripe fruit underpinning a dash of Schwarzbrot.  Thick, full body, dripping with alcohol, really boozy.  Tongue-numbing and hefty middle, big cherries and a scoop of hop resin finishing out the very dry end and toffee-leaning aftertaste.  On the whole, this is the logical, predictable FFF take on the style, down to the last detail, very delicious.  And though shes a solid, worthy offering, this gals not worth the $16 (in-state). [8/10/2007: 3.7]
Heres another yellow wax bottle, brewed in November 2006 and had here in November 2013. Nose searing with alcohol and theres some strong soy sauce out of the bottle, though not out of the glass.  More caramel.  Murky chestnut-brown pour with a very short yellow-tan head and little carbonation.  Dark toffee and caramel, very earthy and sultry in the style of a big German Doppelbock, sweet stone fruit on a bed of broad caramel.  Really liking the dirt character, theres some mild pine but not really any resin or hoppy oils.  The hops have faded significantly but the overall product still tastes pretty fresh.  Some sloppy alcohol in the middle but no burns or heavy fusel breakouts.  Full body with good malt depth and still just enough hop punch for balance, still very sweet with mild sugar spikes and pleasant cloven phenolic character.  Remains what she was when I bought her, an incredibly overpriced exercise in excess that really only works as the third or fourth beer of the night. [11/25/2013: 2.8]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
3028,"2007-08-09",4.0,"Pours caramel / bronze with a modest dense tan head.  The aroma is hoppy as all hell with lots of tropical simcoe-like traits, some pine and citrus, rich caramel malt backing, molasseses and biscuit - excellent.  Thick body that is very smooth and used oil weight with a small amount of carbonation.  This beer is massive in all the rich ways for a barleywine.  The flavor starts with sweet tropical fruits (pineapple and passion fruit mainly), lush caramel malt, dark fruits, brown sugar, subdued abv warmth, rich toffee-like malts and some sharpness.  The finish is highly resiny with all the hops, deep rich sweet malt and bitter complex hops leading to a puckering blend of the two.  This is significantly better than I expected.  Ill try to get another as this would be interesting to compare the somewhat fresh to the aged version.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3028,"2007-08-09",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2009 (Bottle, thanks JCapriotti) Pours beautiful clear deep red. Intense malt and hop aroma with fat tones of caramel, syrup, honey and fudge.English fruit cake and dried fruits like raisins, figs and apricots. Also some fennel, rose pepper, vanilla and hyacinth. Hops bring citrus - mostly grapefruit, but also some resin, apricot and tiny notes of pine, herbal tea and flowers. Hints of other more subtle tropical fruits underneath the massive hop blanket. Some alcohol warmth. Rather creamy nose. Fruity, caramelly and very hoppy flavour with notable alcohol warmth. Complex maltiness of syrup, fudge, dark bread and a sweet fruitiness. The finish is quite dry and floral/citric tart. Hints of vanilla. Thick, chewy, round, soft and a bit sticky mouthfeel. Light to medium sweet with late medium bitterness. Full body.

3028,"2007-08-07",3.9,"Bomber with yellow wax.  Well, I guess its almost fall month or so away, so I think its time enough for this brew to mature.  Quite a robust hoppy and malt nose at first.  Caramel, oak, a bit of orange notes.  with the malt overtones intermingling with a nice hop aroma.  Appearance is a murky brownish/red with a medium sized tan head that diminshes into a soapy tan film.  Taste is a nice caramel malt characteristic, a smokey oak flavor, and a predominant hop characteristics intertwind.  Palate has a rather sticky and sweet aftertaste with a slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat.

Review #200
2007 Bottling
Yellow Wax

Thought Id go with something Ive been wanting to try for awhile now. I must say Im pretty excited. Behemoth Blonde pours decent looking mahogany red but when held to the light it glows ruby. Small lines of carbonation bubbles crawl to the surface. A one finger ivory head formed on the pour that slowly fell and left sheet lacing as it did. Excellent looking beer.

This barleywine is packed to the gills with big aromas. One thing that actually is a little subdued is the hoppiness. A little strange coming from Three Floyds, especially in a barleywine. There are hops but I expected a hop bomb. There is a lot of brown sugar and caramel. Maybe even some raisins. Doughy with a squeeze of grapefruit juice and spicy alcohol. Wonderfully complex.

Definately more hops on the tongue than in the nose. This could actually be more complex in the flavor than the aroma. Brown sugar right up front fades into the doughiness of dark bread and caramel. Theres a very smooth and enjoyable nuttiness that I cant identify. On the finish those hops take hold and the stomping begins. Grapefruit and sticky resiny hops beat all over your mouth and just linger and linger. Holding on as long as possible. Very complex and big. Just my style.

As I get down to the subject of mouthfeel my lips are completely numb. Its been awhile since a beer has done that to me and I love it. For such a heavy big brew this barleywine is in no way sticky or overly sweet. Thick body that becomes airy as it hits the back of the tongue. Silky smooth with that lingering hop kick.

Great drinkability for such a big complex beer. It will easily burn out your tastebuds but that wouldnt stop me. If I had a steady supply I would tip them back regularly.

I decided to try this for my 200th review and Im glad I did. A barleywine thats hard to reckon with. This is the best barleywine Ive sampled in recent memory. Another superb beer from Three Floyds.

3028,"2007-07-06",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2009 ++++ RE-RATE 2-May-09 ++++22 oz bottle purcahsed mail order about a year ago from Archer in Chicago. Purple wax, 2008 Vintage. Pour is hazy cloudy orange golden, pretty settling builds up a one inch off white head that falls with nice splotchy lacing. A bunch of carbonation streaking to the surface. Aroma of soft caramel, dense, layered resiney hops. Some tangerine citrus bitterness in there as well. Really inviting and full nose.  Some yeast grassiness too.  Taste is initially pretty sharp pine and citrus bitterness. Behind that is the sweet caramel and fruit, though the sweetness cloys a bit. Honey and grassy, some alcohol heat behind that. I was expecting this to be a bit softer and more melded based on the nose. Palate is medium, fair carbonation - alcohol present in the long dry finish. Overall, really nice, but highlight was the nose. 9,5,7,3,16 (4.0)

On the other hand, the orange and pine hops come screaming out in the flavor.  The amount of hops make it taste like a very malty and slightly sweet IIPA.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3028,"2007-06-17",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2013 Thanks to drewbeerme, yellow wax. Clear amber red with a moderate head, decent lacing and retention.

This beer with cheese and crackers = win. Basically this beer was like a supercharged bigfoot.

Various floral and citusy hopness swirls through this brew all the way to the end.  12% ABV is well disguised and will nail you before your finished.

Tastes of caramel malts, pine, resin, a little citrus, and hops.  Medium to full body.  Oily texture.  Soft carbonation.  Long, dry, bitter finish.

Humongous sticky sweet nose with maple syrup, tons of malty brown sugar, dark fruit, cherry, heavy black bread, and other stuff Im sure I could strain out if I really tried.

Still, plenty of piny hops highlight the dense caramel/toffee sweetness. Also scent of bark, berries, and earth are present. Upon taking a sip, Im much more impressed. The flavor is so well balanced and rich. Perfect toffee sweetness with a bit of residual drying wood character and delightful pine make up the predominant flavor notes.  Also noted: a bit of dried fruit and vanilla. This was less intense than I was expecting, Id say Bigfoot 06 was more aggressive than this one, but it is still a very, very big beer. The balance and interaction of the whole package really makes this one a winner. Thoroughly enjoyable.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

The aroma consists of lots of sweet caramel, with some fruity citrus notes like grapefruit and apricot, with some pine in there from the hops. Well balanced flavor, a complex blend of sugars, hops, and lots of caramel. Great mouth feel, thick and silky. Slightly acidic finish, I think the alcohol might have dominated a bit too much though.

3-2-08 on tap at FFF:  Better than I remembered.  Did they tweak the recipe, or did the brewing gods just smile down on this batch?  What a wonderful initial hop aroma and flavor.

3028,"2007-04-03",4.3,"Bottle - 2007. Pours dark copper color with a nice sized off-white head on top. The aroma is intense! Loads of grapefruit/citrus hops that Three Floyds is known for. The hops are met with caramel malt, vanilla, and hints of alcohol. Flavor is very comparable to the aroma of the beer. An intense flavor of grapefruit hops met with the sweetness of the caramel malt. The beer is not completely balanced due to it being quite fresh but it is certainly not overly hoppy either. The alcohol does sneak in but it doesnt take away from the flavor of the beer. On the palate this beer is low in carbonation but it doesnt produce it into  a very thick syrupy beer. As is this beer tastes absolutely wonderful.

The flavor is definitely 3F.  Sweet, but not round caramel, big grapefruit, alcohol, a bit toasty.  The malt reminds me of a less caramelly Brian Boru, while the hopes remind me of Pride and Joy.

Re-rate.  2007, yellow wax.  Almost two years after brew date.  Have not had this beer in any vintage since my initial rating.  Let’s see what some age did to this bad boy.  Pours a ruby/orange color with a nice eggnog off-white head.  Aroma is all malt by this point, no hops remain.  The malt is nice - deep caramel, dark fruits, fresh barley.  Raisins and toffee make appearance, slight sherry, a hint of oxidation (wax be damned).  Taste is fruitier than the aroma, candy, toffee and caramel.  Relatively less sweet than expected.  Bitterness subdued.  I think this had aged well.

I have had this a few times from a bottle but now that it comes time to rate it, it will be from the tap.  It is actually slightly better fresh (not that the bottled version loses much).  If you are lucky enough to catch it on tap give it a try.  The goblet is well worth the $5 cost.
Aroma / Appearance - The color of the body reminded me of a deep stain that you would use on wood.  The lingering head was a very dense one finger height.  Thick lacing clung to the sides as I sipped leaving behind strata in the form of foam.
Flavor / Palate - Rich bakers chocolate, caramel, molasses and a light aftertaste begin the pleasurable experience.  The mouthfeel is extremely dense and complex.  A lingering resiny taste coats the inside of the mouth remind me of the coating that goes on a bowling alley lane.  Cherry pie, brown sugar, peanut butter and a balanced maltiness please the senses towards the end of the glass.  For a barley wine it is not sweet at all but a great balance of malts and hoppiness.

Thick and sticky in the mouth, full medium body with adequate, but tame, carbonation. Taste opens with creamy caramel which quickly fades against an assertive hops bitterness that is mostly meaty grapefruit pulp. Oily hop resins abound. Red apple and cherry notes float into the middle. Slight alcohol warming reminds you this is a barleywine and not a gigantic DIPA.

A little more sticky and the hops not over the top, but still there to keep this thing drinking so nice. Bumping the numbers a little bit. Original Rating: Poured an orangey color, slightly hazy, not cloudy/murky, no sedimentation. The head was decent initially, retention of only a thin covering, although decent. The lacing was ok. Aroma was strong citrus and grapefruits, resinous pine for sure, and a cant place sweet malt. The flavor was strong grapefruits right up front and in the aftertaste, bitter grapefruit rinds, pine, light caramel, grapes, and honey. Alcohol is completely absent from the flavor, very nicely hidden by 3F for sure. The malts seemed to have more depth and complexity to offer, but the hops over-ran this thing (no, I wasnt surprised by that). Mouthfeel was very clean, moderately bodied, dry finish, very unsticky and unsweet take on a barleywine. Somewhat like a dIPA, but not malty rich (dryer and more bitter, perhaps?). Very drinkable if there is such thing within the barleywinesI need to do this side by side a Dreadnaught one day.","","User37895"
3028,"2007-01-22",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2007 Pours a wonderful brown/orange with aa nice orangy yellow head that is about as dense and solid looking as foam can be.  Aroma makes you think this is gonna be a complete hop-bomb!  Yikes.  Tones of pine and grapefruit and if you dont swirl the glass, you might catch some of that caramel and brown sugar.  Thankfully the taste is balanced.  Incredibly well-balanced too, to the point where am I asking how is that possible with a beer so not-yet-aged?  Theres a lot of caramel flavor, toffee, nuts, a very very light roast, and a wonderful hop flavor.  The hop flavor isnt all that bitter either.  Instead, it has more of a citrus and grassy taste.  As I swallow theres a little more roast, some cherry, and pine.  The beer finishes woody, a bit dry, and the sweet, buttery, grassy taste of the hops lingers forever.  Wonderful!  That part reminds me of Great Divides Fresh Hop.  Possibly other fresh hop ales as well, but thats the only one Ive had.  The texture of this beer was very creamy, the carbonation was light, but there, and the flavors were so wonderfully blended, I dont see why this beer would need to age, based on the flavor now.  Perhaps aging would change the aroma and make it less IIPA-like, but Im pretty stunned by how good this was.  Worth the price of admission, despite being mostly unaffordable in the first place.  Stunned....  


Tried some 05 Behemoth, thanks to Lumpy, I believe.  This was a lot different than the fresh beer.  Aroma of some molasses, old almost stale hoppiness, wood, and cheese.  Some caramel, syrup, leaves, chocolate and toffee to the taste, but it didnt feel as full-bodied as the fresh beer.  Theres a nice earthy hop flavor to the finish, and some butter.  Not bitter at all.  Mouthfeel was not as creamy, and a bit too slick.  Taste had weakened compared to the fresh beer.  A good beer, but aging this one would appeal to someone else as I thought it was worlds better when fresh. 7/4/7/4/14","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

2005 vintage (almost 2 years aged). pours deep ruby with big off white head. nose is sweet with cotton candy, caramel, sweet plums, tobacco, and slight alcohol. flavor is pretty sweet but not cloying, delicate balance of tobacco, ripe plums, cherry pits, caramel, tar, and a hint of smoke. hops have faded out. very complex and aged well but still needs a few more years. alc is well hidden. mouth feel a tad thin. after 30 minutes the nose is really alcoholy. this is more of a fine liquor than a beer, aging well, 7/5/8/4/17 is equal to 4.1.

11/17/07, 2007 vintaged brewed 11/06 (12 months ago). 22oz bottle, yellow wax. pours a murky reddish brown with creamy white head. nose is strong with aged notes, tobacco, some vegetable, and plum. flavor is a lot less hoppier than i was expecting, the hops have almost all be fallen off with some faint citrus and grapefruit notes, mostly aged malts of tobacco, plum, and caramel. no alcohol is noticed at all body is a tad thin. this has aged really fast, not sure why, it is clear that this much aging this fast has not allowed the malts to age and integrate gracefully, instead it is sort of  a mix a roughly aged malt notes. it is still tasty but it was much better fresh. with how fast this has aged i cant see this getting better but i guess anything is possible. 7/4/7/4/15 is equal to 3.7.

11/21/07, 05 vintage (aged 2 years), this is pretty oxidized and the hops have really fallen off now. lots of tobacco, plums, and tar. no alcohol noticed at all. the nose is pretty bad and mostly vegetables. im enjoying this despite the fact that it hasnt aged gracefully. this may have another year left in it. 4/4/7/4/14 is equal to 3.3.

2/26/08, 2008 vintage, bottled a few weeks ago. pretty much the same impressions as notes at the top of the 07 tap rating. lively, hoppy as hell and juicy. wonderful and fun to drink. but my beer experience has convinced me that this is a IIPA not a barleywine. oh well, its awesome and now surpasses that struggling recent vintages of dreadnaught.4.3. 

6/22/08, 2008 vintage, aged 6 months. on tap at Piece. I guess FFF likes Behemoth with some age on it because they are finally letting some kegs go to Chicago. I prefer it fresh as possible, but aged a bit it seems more barleywine and super fresh it is just a really big IIPA. I was surprised how 6months keg aging has toned the hops down a notch and the malt has already started to take on some aged notes. I cant believe how fast this beer ages. not that it tastes 10 years old or something but quite a bit different than when fresh. 7/4/7/5/16 is equal to 3.9.

Aroma confirms this; Monstrous hop oils and malt structured around underlying notes of fruit and caramel. Other notes include caramel, pine and a whopping dose of alcohol. Flavor is brutal and unforgiving, pounding my mouth and senses with more PNW hops, fine quality malts and sugary resin. Palate is thick and uber smooth, so dry and numbing. I expected to succumb to the allure and taste of this beer, but at this degree of intensity I was surprised I enjoyed it so much. Finishes incredibly long and dry, hops pervade every corner of my mouth and set up camp until something else enters my parched mouth. But, that something was just more of this tasty nectar.

There is also some boozy notes, grain and some caramel malts.  Flavor is again quite hoppy, but a little more earthy.  The grain is in there as well with  some fairly sweet caramel malts--sweeter than Id imagined from the aroma--with a bone dry finish.  Burps pine.

3028,"2006-12-23",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Carnivals are the pinnacle of excess.  Every sense is given its share of the feast, and each one ends up dizzyingly sick by the end.  The screams and shouts of vendors and customers, and the spine tingling shrieks of fearful roller coaster riders tests the durability of ones ear drums.  A thousand short thugs equipped with sticky clubs of all colors and sizes brush past your ankles, coating them in enough high fructose corn syrup to knock out a dozen pancreases.  The smells of boiling sulfurous cheese and a dozen too many sick people pour out from oil barrel trash cans like cauldrons, stifling the air and pushing away all the viable oxygen.  Thousands of flashing, beaming lights threaten to paralyze epileptics miles away.  And most excessive of all is the food.  Men and women, girls and boys all gorge on sugar and grease, sometimes greasy sugar, stuffing their maws with indescribable fried foods and sweets sugary enough to disintegrate a healthy molar in five minutes flat.  The price is the cost of a ticket and about 5 years off ones life span but its worth it.  Me?  There hasnt been an old fashioned carnival town in years, but Ive found a substitute: Three Floyds Behemoth.  This thing just fills your cranium with explosive, oozing and rich flavor.  It comes from a Japanese lacquer red drink with a hastily defused chai colored head.  The thing is burgeoning with immediately recognizable smells like pear, nutmeg and cardamom.  Some gin, raisins, malts, hops, pine resin and juniper berries gives it some adult flavoring, but the lot together makes it sweet as candy but razor sharp as a flask of hard booze.  All those familiar smells carry over to the taste, too.  The mouth feel is light yet oily, burning with fizzled hops and lovingly embraced by a lot of dry evergreen forest sweetness.  That 1st degree tongue lashing is, in a strange way, masochistically pleasurable.  Behemoth is almost a syrup, dripping like honey overflowing from a hive, like cotton candy wisps inching out of the vat, like a smore with the marshmallow dripping and gobbling up the bottom half of the snack, like ice cream in a deluge of Ghiradelli fudge.  It is gluttony in a glass, and the sinner gets a punch of flavor in the nose for it.  Put on your helmet and safety goggles for this one because your liable to break something when your vision starts to warp from pure sensual excess youll be staggering in a drunken, happy state, knocking things and people over without a care in the world, cause youve got a glass of a damn fine drink: Behemoth.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3028,"2006-11-29",3.8,"At last, Three Floyds! What an event, and how couldnt it be, dressed in such extravagant pink wax? I approached this colossus with quiet expectations and a reserved sense of excitement, fearing an elaborate fraud, or a likely disappointment. What appeared in my glass manifested an obvious and hypnotizing beauty: dark, opaque and truly ruby red (for I am used to taking slight creative liberties), the topping was reduced to a side-attraction, biscuit-colored and disguised in a layer of small shiny bubbles. To the nose, an intense, flamboyant and absolutely theatrical fanfare of hops displays in the gleaming spotlights the panoply of its talents. Sugary pine, toast, juicy grapefruit, the opulence of this brew is simply staggering. Pure maple syrup, cedar and chestnut honey create a sticky scent enhanced by noticeable alcohol and again the orchestral hops. Somehow the flavor surprised me. Though it clearly echoes the nose, I found it difficult to imagine a marching band parading across my tongue until I actually took a sip. Cymbals, trumpets and every instrument you can think of flare upon the palate in what could seem like a cacophony but in fact reduces to a simple and unified roar. Lemon, lime, apricot, banana, pine, caramel, grape juice and sap explode on the taste buds.


Despite such a gargantuan profile, and surely what my colleagues across America seem to applaud, I didnt care much for the Behemoth. It was entertaining, no doubt, but beyond the ferocity of its flavors, and even its honorable complexity, I felt Behemoth lacked true pleasure. The analogy I described to my friend GarrettB, with whom I shared the bottle, is, I believe, opportune. Three Floyds, or my experience of the brewery so far, is to me reminiscent of the famous artist Piet Mondrian. What emerges from his work is a bold, new approach to color, composition and an entirely different perception of art. Below the apparent minimalism is a depth of meaning and commentary that ultimately becomes dissolved by the populace. The result is perhaps a sentiment of insolence but also an appreciation for the implications of art itself. Yet, however rich this context may be, I almost always find myself more interested by the intricacy of a Da Vinci, the sfumato or early chiaroscuro techniques he employed, the subtle brush strokes and complex forms of his paintings. Even the loose and more conceptual line quality of his sketches are infinitely more satisfying to me. Transcending the painting, Da Vinci loses no ground to modern art, as the meaning of his work is still debated upon. If I can have the best of both worlds, then to me theres much more to gain, whether that means Trappists or Gueuzes or otherwise. That said, Im not opposed to a little education.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3028,"2006-07-18",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2007 #500. I got this in Chicago last November and I thought I would save it for something special (since it was $15-gotta get the ""3F=expensive"" dig in somewhere). Poured into a NB worthy tulip. The beer is ~45 minutes out of a cool beer fridge, probably not too much colder than the room temp of 71°. The beer is dark amber/red with a fine carbonation and a practically non-existant head. The caramelly aroma hits me nearly a foot away. When my nose dives into the glass I get caramel, malt, hot alcohol, and resiny hops. The initial taste is sweet, caramelly malt, brown sugar, xmas spices? followed by a rush of alcohol and citrusy hops. The finish is fiery alcohol that exits via my nostrils. The mouthfeel is nice and full and is cleaned up completely by the alcohol. I am unimpressed to say the least. I have put the remainder of the bottle in the freezer, hoping that some chill on the beer will tame the hot alcohol and restore some balance to this beer. Will re-rate in a bit.  (7/3/6/4/14-3.4) OK, the beer is cooled off and I can smell the difference right away, same aroma sans hot alcohol. Taste is the same, but with a little more malt depth and only a warming alcohol in the middle and a moderately hot alcohol finish, it is certainly better a little cooler. I would give it another flavor point and another overall point, but this barleywine is more a run of the mill barleywine and not an elite barleywine like an Old Ho, Old Backus, and Bells batch 6000.

Malty, alcohol, very sweet lovely balanced hops in aroma - wow.  A sniffed this for a good couple of minutes before tasting.  Full bodied foamy mouthfeel - perfect.  Complex taste - Ive had more complex mind you, and more in your face, and certainly more hoppy, but rarely one more balanced and drinkable than this.  So well put together.  Did not even think of it as a barleywine, just a solid drinkable strong alcohol beverage.  An incredible drinking  experience.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
3028,"2006-05-13",4.3,"Garnet colored pour with little head retention.  A huge wall of citrusy hops seep up and out of the glass.  On closer inspection, notes of jungle fruits, plums, toffee and brown sugar intermingle with the classic FFF hops perfectly.  The body is full, balanced and a real drinker at 10.5 ABV.  Creamy mouthfeel.  The nutty, sweet malts melt into a perfectly balanced, bitter finish.  Wow, I just wish I had a few bottles in the cellar.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Delicious flavour of caramel malt, lots of hops, brown sugar and alcohol -- all incredibly well balanced and with a nice, long bitter finish. Medium to full bodied. What a way to end the night!

Hazy ruby with a smallish head.  Wonderful woody sweet alcohol toasty malt with balancing sweet resiny hops - god this is nice.  Taste is a smoothly balanced roast malt, citrus/resin hop, yeast and alcohol balance - finishes long, balanced - the caramel malt emerges and the alcohol rides high but not over the top, age this another couple of years and its a 10.  Mouthfeel - solid, perfect body, alcoholic and lightlly astringent mouthfeel, obviously alcoholic, but smooth, smooth, smooth - one of the best, age it 3 years and watch out.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
3028,"2006-05-07",4.3,"From a 22oz. brown bomber bottle with a pink floyd (I am so ""old"" that Im the only one to see the connection?) wax dripped neck, no bottled/freshness date. Made a good appearance, poured a cloudy garnet with a foamy, bubbly pale tannish head that settled into a thin lacing, good carbonation for a barley wine. Had a sweet fruity and caramel malty nose, with whiffs of hops and spicy alcohol. A crisp, textured and creamy smooth, carbonated light, medium bodied mouth feel, very good drinkability. Sweet, candy-like caramel maltiness,a pineapple fruitiness, piney resiny, citric hops, gentle in their rolling bitterness, a spicy Caribbean rum-like alcohol warmth in the palate, the dry Three Floyds yeastiness and a dry sweet fruity malty finish with the hops and alcohol warmth lingering in the palate.
An excellent barley wine from Three Floyds, tasty and balanced, a must try.

3028,"2006-05-04",4.4,"22oz bottle via trade with 1FastSTI - Thanks! - Pours a beautiful dark copper/mahogony with a nice short tan head that fades quickly.  Aroma is cherry, caramel, grapefruit, molasses, orange, and maybe even a little brown sugar and maple.  A delightful blend of citrus fruits, orange, grapefruit, and sweet brown sugar, caramel, maple, and cherry in flavor.  Amazingly complex and smooth to drink. There is so much flavor here that you do not realize at all the 10.5% alcohol in this big beautiful brew.  Palate is sticky sweet but oh so smooth on the tongue.    Finish is just a tickle from the bitterness of those hops that are there throughout each sip.  This is divine!","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
3028,"2006-04-25",4.3,"Bomber poured into squat Belgian snifter, ...dark mahogany/ burgundy blend fills the glass, out wafts the aroma, and I know Ill be spanked but good!

Little head here, though, it appears for a moment and disappears quickly. 

Aroma screams brandy, cherries, hints of bourbon, port wine, licks of leather, spicy and slick...molasses, dark rum, brown sugar..liking it...

Now to taste: the Behemoth floods the mouth with fierce flavor and coats every inch with deliciousness, spreading tendrils of delight through every crack in the palate. And a thunder thuds above, as alcohol creeps along as well...boom, boom...hear his steps as he clods along the corridors of the brain...flavors detected in the nose reassert themselves on the tongue...l the slick sugary darkness, the caramel-y sweetness, the thick, resonant malt, the powerful potency. An aptly named brew, and it appears to be quite stronger than the last time I had it, on tap, nearly 4 years ago. It was 10% then, and a killer diller at that. Guess that envelope had to be pushed, eh, Floyd, Floyd, and Floyd?

Huge body, immense mouthfeel, long, slightly bitter, thick and resiny finish. A hell of a barleywine. But I want it in little bottles, not these monster servings. And I want it available in my home state, again. And I want a million dollars, and a pony, and a Rockem, Sockem robots, and Mommy and Daddy to get back together, and world peace, and no hunger, and, and, and...

Boom, boom, boom, Ive barely gotten into it, and its knocking at my frontal lobes...were coming i-in...hide the ki-ids...here I am, wishing Id saved this for a get-together with friends, and continue drinking it solo, and hoping I dont wake up wanting to kill myself tomorrow morning...afternoon...?

I really, really like this, but its a serious sipper of a brew, one that should accompany a long evening with the works of Wordsworth at hand, Old Dog Tray at ones feet, a roaring fire beside, attired in a comfortable robe...you know the scene...

Im drooling over the intense flavors as much as the goons on the label, but not drooling over Miss Behemoth as they are...I just dont find three chins very sexy.

Hazy ruby/amber with a big quickly discipating off-ivory head that fades to a thin long lasting rim. Nose very full of malts alcohol plums and caramelized sugar. Hops not so much intiailly but as it wars they pick up. The taste initially is tangy, strong with alcohol, citrusy hops and malts. The middle is much more genel with malt and alcohol then fades into strong vapros of alcohol and crisp hoppy spice with grapefruit towards the back. The end is a rush of hops barley and produces kind of an evergreen flavor. Imagine climbing a pine tree as a kid, then later you eat something without washing your hands.

3028,"2006-03-18",4.2,"Hops stand out in the aroma - resiny, piney, and peach-grapefruit citrusy; alcohol is next - peppery and fruity with a slight burn; and lastly there is some caramel malt to provide some balance.   Clear ruby-amber color, thin wisps of off-white head linger, but very little head formation or retention overall.  Caramel-fruity sweetness overpowered by resiny hop bitterness in the flavor - big flavors all around, with bitterness winning out in the end.  Full body, some hop-derived astringency and mild alcohol burn, moderate carbonation - not really easy-drinking, but less harsh than some other barleywines.  Overall, this is a big, in-your-face barleywine.  Imagine a souped-up car stereo - everything is cranked to the max, the whole car is shaking, but it is high quality system - loud but little distortion.  Is it too loud?

Well, I had to work this evening until 2am and decided to come home and ""celebrate"" with a beer; this one in particular. Pours a pretty rubyish copper with no head, unless the ring of microbubbles around the circumference of the glass counts. The aroma is hoppy and piney with candied apple notes, caramel, bit of maple syrup and creamy malts. Bit of alcohol is still noticeable as well. Taste is suitably rich! Sweet pineapples, light pine needle, more candied apples, caramel, chocolate malt balls (Whoppers), orange peel and alcohol. This isnt as hoppy as Id expected, but still packs a punch. Body is creamy and smooth with mild alcohol warmth coming through but relaxing to leave a mild hop bitterness behind. Finish seems a bit dry with more sugary notes coming out.

3028,"2005-12-31",4.2,"Massive thanks to Secret Santa Jimmack!  After reading all the complaining about this beer and its out of balance hops, I decided that it would be the perfect brew to finish up 2005.  Pretty clear copper, tinge of ruby, great head initially, faded away slow.  Aroma hints of caramel, but is essentially a hop bomb, a mix of loads of citrus (primarily grapefruit), anise, and a bit of pine.  Caramel and smoky roasty notes are the immediate flavors on the tongue.  They wilt under a massive hop attack, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, anise, combine together for an intensely bitter finish.  Not smooth, this is a beer that would slap your mother.  Just as it should be.  It would be interesting to see how the hops mellow out over time, to see if there is enough malt body to carry the beer into a happy retirement.  But the soul of this brew is hops, and allowing them to mellow out would be to disrespect the glory they currently possess.  So although the rough edges prevent me from going but so nuts about the score on this beer, it is that wild spirit that makes me love the beer.

3028,"2005-12-23",3.5,"2005 release, Sampled December, 2005
Pours with a frothy, one finger thick (at most), pale tan colored head.  The beer is brilliantly clear, ruby red color that has lots of bubbles rising slowly through the thick viscous body.  The aroma is quite sweet and fruity up front; redolent of tropical fruit notes as well as peach, apricot, pineapple, mango, hints of kiwi.  It is an odd mixture, almost like a tropical fruit cough syrup; though it is actually interesting and even nice.  The aroma ends with a hit of spicy alcohol, which clears the sinuses a bit.

The taste is quite sweet as well, and at first does not seem quite so fruity as the aroma, but towards the end the tropical fruit notes really start to kick in.  Peach, and apricot are prominent, but there are also notes of mango, definitely papaya, and hints of lychee.  The finish is really where these tropical fruit notes start to get funky; they definitely remind me of some type of cough syrup, or perhaps even childrens aspirin.  The finish is solidly bitter of course, but it is also joined by that lingering, sweet medicinal note.

This is really quite a bit different than the last time I had this (in 2004), then it did not have the tropical fruit notes.  My guess is that the hop bill changed on this.  The tropical fruit notes are not bad, in fact they make the usual hop character quite interesting, but it is the medicinal notes in the finish that is a bit distracting.  I do have this to say for it though, it is quite interesting!

3028,"2005-12-14",3.7,"NJ, Pocono, Philly YEHa!05. Deep amber body with some noticeable viscosity and a thin filmy off-white head. Appealing range of citrus and tropical fruit hop aromas but also smells quite resinous. Alcohol is also quite apparent in the nose. Flavor is not exactly bad but was too rough and out of balance. Hop profile is like sucking on tree bark, the bitterness is coarse and harsh yet the residual malt sweetness seems quite high, and the impression of alcohol is elevated and hot. May just need time for the hop flavor and bitterness to soften and the malts to open up and provide some integrating balance. As a young barley wine, this wasnt especially pleasing. I preferred the small sample that I mixed with a dash of New Glarus Belgian Red. Long sought after, I wont say Im disappointed but rather be optimistic instead and say that a re-rate is pending circa 2008 if the beer gods grant me the opportunity.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

Theres no mistaking this is a FFF brew the moment the pink wax is cut and the cap released.   Aroma is pungent with cat piss, scads of alcohol, and plenty of citrus/grapefruit blossom.  The beer is much sweeter than I anticipated, and uncomfortably so with the enormous amount of alcohol present throughout.  The stuff is intensely hot, harsh, and almost mean to the senses.

3028,"2005-12-12",4.2,"Finally got ahold of one of these fatties. The beer glowed with a nice rosy-redness in the light. Sweet-smelling nose was very inviting. Great texture ... thick (especially as it warmed), weighty and smooth, but not necessarily cloying (alcohol warmth seemed to cleave that right off). Hops were electric on the tongue right from the beginning. Surprisingly, I found the malt sweetness (mostly caramel notes) to be rather subdued (for some reason I was thinking it would be sweeter). Hop flavors/aromas were plant-like and grapefruity. A healthy amount of bitterness -- laden with a woody saltiness -- followed through into the finish, and lingered in the aftertaste. Halfway down the bottle, and on occasion, some really nice notes surfaced (hard to define, kind of ""woodsy,"" but not ""woody,"" if that makes any sense ... perfect pairing for a cigar, if that makes it any clearer). Fantastic brew, at any rate.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

Nice dark amber with a tint or red and a thin cream head.  As for subtleties in the aroma, there isnt much beyond the sweet citrus smell and a less copious smell of malt.  The flavor comes off as a nice hearty malt taste.  Real filling for the entire mouth, but still is very hot.  There is a decent sharpness towards the end where the hops make their appearance in the flavor.  Mouthfeel takes a knock in my book because of how hot and bitter this beer is.

3028,"2005-11-16",2.9,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2007 2005 bottle provided by Muzzlehatch and sampled on 11/6/2005.  Pours a foamy off-white to light beige head atop a filtered ruby-amber body (not opaque, Martin).  Head shows moderate to low retention with no lacing.  Aroma of intense amarillo hops fruitiness.  Juicy tropical fruits abound, with a thick caramel sweetness, plenty of ruby red grapefruit and moderately resinous hops bitterness.  Being fresh and full of hops, the aroma strength is through the roof.  I dont get complex caramel sweetness at all, out of the nose.  Rather, I get huge caramel sweetness with a touch of drying yeast.  No one mentions more than ""sweet"" or ""caramelly"" or ""candyish/sugary"" malts in the nose description, yet everyone seems to love it.  Guess most people dont care for malt complexity in the nose.Flavor bludgeons you with a massive dose of pine resin, bitter grapefruit and other citrus notes, while the sweet candyish-to-caramel malt attempts to balance.  In the end, it dosent even remotely succeed, the hops being too acidic, bitter and sticky.  The fair amount of alcohol apparency does not help matters either.  Notes of yeast bi-product fruitiness are obviously apparent as well.  Body is full, mouthfeel has low to moderate carbonation and a syrupy, sticky-sweet texture, but still missing that smooth silky texture that only non-filtration can bring.  No attempt at balance, and thats fine, I realize and appreciate that 3 Floyds doesnt value balance in most of their higher gravity brews.  Dont really think it will improve with age either.  The hops will die off, somewhat, sure, but the complete filtration, just like in this years darklord, will not allow it to hold up to oxidation, nor do I think the alcohol will be able to integrate as well.  And ending on a positive note, its not cloyingly sweet.2005 bottle consumed on 1/18/07Well with some 14 or so months of age on it, Ive got to say I like it even less, or was being generous in my initial rating.  I poured myself about 6 ounces and had to dump about 3 of them in to SuIIys glass.  Too much bitterness, sweetness and no real class.  I dont even find it that complex, the hops, even having faded somewhat, just steal away the show.  Bitter and now soggy with too much acid and alcohol warmth.  The body still is comfortable, with lots of sweet, round sugars, but it dosent seem to have improved.  Guess Ill have to wait another 2 or 3 years until the hops have completely faded to see how the malts work.  The wax is great though, no oxidation whatsoever.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Opaque ruby red, with a light grey head.Whowza!  Like getting smacked in the face by a pine branch with hops duck-taped on it, it was totally woodsy, then turned minty fresh, then it was more like cranberries and strawberries macerated in eau-de-vie.  The hops just snapped.  I must have smelled it for at least 3 minutes before taking my first sip.
A body so huge I could have just stuck a fork in it and lick it.  It knocks you out with a 3-punch combo of massive caramel malt, hop bitterness you feel all the way into the nerve endings of your teeth and a and alcoholic vapor that gets you right in the chest.

3028,"2005-11-06",3.6,"Sorrowfully totally clear amber-orange pour atop which an initially honest off-white cover fades at a constant rhythm. Expressive aroma firstly disarming you through a blast of floral, piney, sprucey aromatic amarillos. The underlying malt is not to be neglected, highly candyish, like concentrated Jolly Rancher juice. Tons of residual sugar components, yet well developed fruitiness, rich with melon and perfumed berry notes. Quite boozy in mouth, if not necessarily harshly so thanks to the cognac-like nature of the alcohol, reminding of a concentrated wine. Thus very sweet and fittingly very hoppy, foresty, fruity, woody and throath-coating. Very malty spirit is betrayed by a rather syrupy palate, certainly fruity and alcoholic, but also rather oily and slick even, the carbonation being restrained to say the least. Far from a favourite among barleywines, just not very mature nor sagacious, it remains an experiment worth seeking out.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3028,"2005-10-31",3.9,"Not as big as I thought. For some reason, I expected this to be something like fifteen percent alcohol. Im not dissapointed as this is a fine brew but I just have this idea in my head of Three Floyds cooking up beautiful brutality to such an extent it boggles the mind. 

Carefully poured, this is a crystal clear deep ruby brew--just a bit of head that wanes somewhat quickly as I generally expect in such a high gravity brew. The nose here is very interesting; underneath the expected layers of pine, citrus and kind bud is sort of a roasty, savory, slightly salty note, in a strange way reminiscent of roasted meat. I cant explain it but its there. Not as full bodied as I expected but w/ lively carbonation and a nice sweet citrus taste to compliment some more pine notes. Alcohol is very there but not at all unpleasant, a very refined ethanol kind of taste that provides a dry counterpoint to the malt sweetness. Im finding this suprisingly quaffable given the sheer tonnage of ingredients that undoubtedly went into this. Im not sure if this is worth the million gazillion dollars I paid for it but I enjoy it nonetheless and thats what counts when the day is done.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Hops (its Three Floyds, after all), sweet malt, caramel, vanilla, honey (?).  Rich mouthfeel, smooth and syrupy and full.  The flavor was sweet and syrupy and hoppy with elements of port.

The huge hop aroma covered everything else BUT it seemed tight.  I dont know if it is the specific hop or that it is too much.  I love tons of hop aroma but it didnt spread and fill it was more like a tight punch.  A nice tight punch but there is always something a little wrong with getting punched.  The flavor was malty sweet that became quickly replaced by hop big flavors.  The alcohol seemed to thin up the very finish of an otherwise full bodied beer.

3028,"2005-10-23",4.4,"Amber brown body with a decent head. The hops are huge and not the normal hop profile. Its like taking a whiff of a crushed mint leaf at first and then after a few more sniffs you start picking up a little basil and maybe a slight touch of tobacco. The malt and alcohol are entirely covered up by the hops. The flavor is much less syrupy than I had expected and this actually turns into a very drinkable beer. The hop aroma is just huge, but but the bitterness isnt overbearing. The alcohol isnt too noticeable and the malt isnt too cloying. One of the better hop monster barleywines Ive ever had and actually the first Three Floyds big hype beer that I actually agree with the hype. I was disappointed in Dreadnaught. Didnt really care too much for Dark Lord, but Behemoth is actually extremely good.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

3028,"2005-10-17",4.2,"Cherry red color with a small, light tan head, which quickly fades.  Monstrous piney and resiny hop aroma, juicy as hell, which after some time begins to smell very medicinal.  Nothing but hop aromatics in the aroma and if this were a Double IPA that would be fine, but in a barley wine I want malt aromatics.  Still though, the hops are vibrant enough in the nose to definately be enjoyable.  The body is undeniably huge and provides a nice mouth experience.  The flavor is fairly well balanced between hop and malt flavors, but overall I suppose this is more of a hop accented barley wine.  Loads of juicy, medicinal hop flavors throughout the palate, with hints of grapefruit.  The malts hints of toffee all the way through, with hints of caramel and roasted nuts.  Quite the tasty treat, but it needs your complete attention and a pretty large sample, because it changes very much throughout the tasting.  Also, I am not one for aging barley wines, but this really needs some time.  Maybe it will peak at around six to eight months.

Perhaps I should have this for breakfast. Im sure it would be an eye opener. Some mild hints of pie crust malt, peaches and watermelon bubblegum. I would likely put the aroma higher if this wasnt a barley wine, as I really want more malt in this style. Just my preference. In a year or so Im sure my rating would go up significantly. Holy lactating, agrarian, bovine mammal batman, this is a hops monster, that I am at a near loss of words.  Lots of sweet malt, but more than a boat load of hops. The malt flavors are not that well defined but the sweetness is there to balance all the alphas and betas coursing through my palate. Smooth, lightly silky in feel. Flavors of light fruit, with raisins, and plums. Floral and a touch of pine and grapefruit hops flavors. A sweet laffy taffy middle, with melon and mild berry. Malt come back in the linger, but yet the hops acidity still stings the tongue. Call this an american strong and this is near the top of my list   As a barley wine, this will need to sit a year or five to be in my tops per style. I wish I could let one set that long. Great brew.

3028,"2005-10-09",4.5,"Poured from a 2005 vintage bomber, I decided to undertake one of these myself.  As I uncapped the bottle, all I could think was ""Holy grapefruit hops, Batman!""  I then began by pouring some into my snifter.  I am delighted by the dark ruby red body.  A thin white head tops the beer but quickly diminishes to a near nothingness.  A nice lacing adorns the glass.  So, I dip my nose inside the rim of the snifter to get a full dose of the aroma.  Citrus, sweet spruce, oranges, ever-so-light cheesecake, caramel, and light brown sugar make up the majority of the aroma.  So, I decide to jump into tasting.  Im met by a superbly balanced hop/malt.  Trying to start with the flavor was a mistake because all I can think of is the palate.  It is very smooth, creamy, velvety, medium-full body with a clean refreshing feel.  So, back to the flavor.  I am enticed with a similarity to strawberry wine.  Now, imagine that doused with hops.  Citrus, grapefruit mostly with thoughts of pineapple sits atop the tons of what I suspect is amarillo hops making the strawberry flavor.  Theres a nice caramel sweetness that fills out the flavor.  More on the palate... after drinking more of this, it comes off as dry.  I would love a massive dose of Maris Otter malts in this.  I think thatd have the potential to make this truly ""great"".","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3028,"2005-10-08",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2006 22oz bottle, 2005 vintage.Dark ruby copper liquid forms an off-white head on pour that doesnt last long save for the tiny rim of bubbles that remain. Rather straight-forward, unsubtle aroma of Northwest hops like a double IPA: very piney, citrusy, spicy and a bit tart. Would have liked some malt in the aroma. After sniffing it I feared this beer would basically be Cascade and/or Centennial hops reduced to liquid form. Thankfully it wasnt. While the NW hops play a prominent role in the flavor with an abundance of their characteristic bitter, spicy, floral and citrus attributes, they are well balanced by lots of sweet caramel malt. Exceptionally smooth palate for a beer this sweet -- not sticky at all. I dont care much for the liberal use of Cascade/Centennial hops for this style of beer but Three Floyds does it better than anyone else. This is a loving tribute to its British forbears while giving it a distinctly American flavor. Nice stuff that should probably be revisited after some aging. Agreed with heemer that the cost is not justified but 3F knows they can charge a left testicle (which is precisely what they do in this case) and people will still line up. The free market will do its thing, rational or not..<P>RE-RATE July 2006: Wow, what a difference a few months makes. This stuff is aging phenomenally well. The rough alcohol and sharp bitterness have both settled down, providing a smooth warming alcohol presence and a  suave tobbaco-leaf spicy bitternes. I wasnt sure if a Three Floyds barleywine wouldnt be too aggressive when I first tried this stuff; now I know that a mere bit of patience is all that is required to bring out the best in this brew and make it a fine barleywine.

3028,"2005-10-03",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2009 2005 Bottle.  This beer is one of 3 things; A) Not the same beer as the draft version that propelled it to the top 20.  B) Too young to be drinking now.  C) Just crazy over-rated.  Pours a brilliant copper color.  Aroma is very hoppy, real floral piney and citrus.  All the 3F characteristics are here.  Flavor is hoppy at first, becoming quite sweet once you really get into it.   Ive had so many better tasting barley wines. Unbalanced, doesnt even taste like a barley wine.  I know the style itself is fairly broad, but still.  The mouthfeel is certainly not thin, but its not chewy and juicy, and thats how I expect a BW to be. Alcohol is present, never overpowering but definately there especially when it warms up.  Nothing to rave about at all.   I would normally not mention the price as part of a rating, and it does not affect my numbers, but this isnt worth $15 a bottle by any stretch.  Not even close.  Ill check back in a year or two and see how this has aged. I think with some years, the flavors will probably come together, but who knows. They may not.

Well, after 4 years in the bottle lets see what has happened.  Not quite as bad as I expected.  You have to give it to 3F, they do make some quality products.  However, this beer was built to be consumed fresh.  Its lost most of its hops and sweetened right up.  So, if you have a bottle of a newer batch, quit wasting time and open it.

3028,"2005-10-03",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2006 2001 batch on tap at the Three Floyds brewpub, January 2006.Hazy, safire and caramel brown in color with a creamy, tan bubble pocked bowtie formation for the head.  Aroma is a tale of subtle glory.  Matured black cherries, raspberry fig chews, rosebuds, red and black currant mix, deep amaretto, black raspberry seeds, boysenberries and a tiny hint of alcohol.  Lord is this flavor smooth.  The epitome of an aged barleywine, upstaging Third Coast Old Ale and Old Horizontal.  Ripe cream cheese qualities allude to raspberry cheesecake.  More chewy than the fresh bottled batch.  My wife would be revolted by my palate chomping.  Patronizes the notion of a balanced equilibrium.  Sticky malts and a supportive hop backdrop couldnt form a more symbiotic relationship.  Finishes like a raspberry cream cheese danish and almond butter laden with juniper berries, free from all jovial qualities.  Ill be damned.  This was the Dr. Jekyll; the bomber was Mr. Hyde.
2005 bomber all to myself - fresh, October 2005.Semi-syrupy pour to a translucent brass color, seemingly filtered, but with good reason.  Dusty tan bubbles for the head and sexy legs on the side of my snifter throughout all 22-ounces of bliss.  This is one hell of a nose: lavender, strawberries, grapefruit, star fruit, cherry cheesecake, amarillo and brown sugar.  Flavor is a wham-bam bitch slap, and I turn the other cheek.  Amaretto, cherry juice and liquefied brown sugar register first.  My taste buds play host to a citric floral conference (pineapple, grapefruit and papaya.)  Throw in a touch of cooking sherry for good measure and now the complexities are innumerable.  Bitterness resounds while a caramel cadence drums up the malt support.  Vinous, oozing and dehydrating, making me reach for more more more.  The balancing act couldnt be more harmonious - in fact, its perfect.  Bitter and comprehensive finish spurring an aftertaste of raspberry crepes basking in maple syrup.  Worth every penny, mile and minute to obtain.  God bless.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

It poured a near headless golden brown.  The aroma is a sweet caramel/toffee malt, somewhat fruity, with a trace of alcohol and a light citric and pine hop scent. This is thick and warm in the mouth, a pleasure to savor before swallowing.  The flavor remains fruity (plums, cherries...) with caramel and butterscotch and alcohol and just a touch of hop bitterness.

Original review:
On tap at Brewery. Multicolored hue of red/brown/orange with a average sized head and good lacing. Full bodied. Breathtaking aroma of smoke, brown sugar, grapefruit, molasses, dark bread with a hint of roasted malt and nuts. Sweet taste with a moderate level of alcohol, smooth for a beer this big. Syrupy and soft mouthfeel. Im not the biggest fan of barleywine, this one could change my mind.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

There is a hop nose, but very little hop in the flavor.  Flavor consists of caramel, raisins and alcohol.  Another great brew but this keg will last forever, it absolutley kicks you in the ass.  Thanks Three Floyds for the hangovers my wife and I will incur over the next few months.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"

Higher than I expected carbonation is the first noticable attribute. A nice spicey sweet aroma with borderline alcohol fumes.

Okay, in all actuality I was more amazed at just how I wasn't overpowered.

The taste is a beautiful amalgamation of smooth caramel malts..just perfectly sweet with a tiny bittering alcohol presence. Fruity orange and citrus undertones caress the palate.

Rich malt aroma with caramel and fruit (pear and fig), but mainly caramel, with peppery hops.  Full round sweetness and lip smacking lingering toffee like flavors.  Resiny and peppery hop flavors with a lingering mild bitterness.  Alcoholic strength is definitely apparent with a chest warming buzz, but generally speaking its well masked for an 11+% beer.  Beer becomes sticky and sweet, almost syrupy, towards the end - a bit unattractive in a barleywine, and indicative IMO of under-attenuation, perhaps the yeast pooped out in all that alcohol.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

2005 bottle:
Voluminous raspberries and cranberries are candied to sweeten this fruity hop wine...Malt is slender (hope it doesnt hinder its aging potential), and carbonation is low even for the style...Alcohol burning fits with the resinous hops flavor and bitterness, but the rather thin mouthfeel makes the heat a little too obvious...A splendid effort, full of charisma, but maybe still too immature to yield masterpiece sagacity...4.1/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

After swirling it a bit, the tan head reamerged in thick gloppy swaths reminicant of the condesed milk at the top of a Thai Ice tea.  The nose is something of beauty.  Upon opening this gem I was kicked in the nose with fresh  hops.  As it warmed more malt started to haze over the greenery with a winey nearly salty charactor evolving furthur into caramel, burnt sugar, and toffee.  The mouthfeel remains improbably thick and creamy, almost like fine grade maple syrup.  Stong nots of malt viniouness, citic hops (grapefruit) cadi sugar, black peppar, toffee, light alcohol, caramel.  Finish ligers for ever and cascades from wine to floral hops, to bread ending with more hops.  Comes across sweet and dry at the same time (not sure how).

Now back to the beer; there may be better beers but I have never tried it. this one may get a boost from the fact that it did not sit on a boat from Europe for the last few months. Like a bouquet of flowers, fresh, sweet, intense. This beer is divine. Dark red/copper color. Almost no head but leaves a thick coating of lace in the glass neverless.  This beer is not a thirst quencher by any means. Perfect for after dinner, late night. Unbelievebly smooth but intensely complex.Hard to find any faults.

3028,"2002-12-14",4.2,"Now this is a fantastic brew! Dark copper body with only a little head fighting its way through the thickness.Big malty body with a very nice hop presence. Aromas of cherry and alcohol greet you when you raise your glass. Another perfectly balanced brew. How do they do this. Either the floyds are master brewers with tremendous patience to go through all the hits and misses or they are the luckiest bastards in the world to have found the perfect balance in everything they brew. Either way anyone who has the pleasure of sampling one of their brews is the recipient of some masterful craftmanship.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
3028,"2002-12-13",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 17, 2008 Draft... This beer rocks!... The aroma is very malty, alcoholic and floral.
This sparkling clear amber beer has a small, creamy, khaki colored head. Mostly diminishing with excellent lacing. The flavor is rich and malty/sweet. Bursts of molasses and honey with lots of grapefruit and resin. Crazily full-bodied. with a syrupy mouthfeel. Lively carbonation. Long, sweet, clover-laden finish. These guys just cant go wrong.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3028,"2002-12-08",4.6,"A huge massive Homeric epic quality of a beer.  Like a Roman plum farm ready for harvest in the height of the Germanic empire.  Ralphm Wigum would say, I broke my Wookie.  Like an everlasting hoppy goobstooper exploding in my mouth like a thousand explosions in my mouth look forward to the exclamation of  a thousand Klingons yelling to Carl Sagan about Hawking on the event horizon.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
3028,"2002-12-08",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2003 (4.6)On tap at Three Floyds and sleeping in a 1/2 growler in my beer fridge.HUGE beer, warming. Sweet, malty, hoppy,Question is how long will that growler last ? Go get you some !Re-rate Gravity Head 2003 -Vintage 2001 keg darker, and sweeter than the version at had at Nick Floyds,the smooth complexity of this beer really masks the strong ABV.Amazing !","Indiana, Indiana, USA","Racegoer"
3028,"2002-12-08",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2003 Easily my favorite Barley.  Rivals Bigfoot in hops.  Sweet.  A balance between malt & hops.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
3028,"2002-11-10",4.1,"A wonderful, beautiful barleywine.  Notes of alcohol, vanilla, caramel, fruits (peach, plums, other soft fruits).  A really sweet barley wine with a nice hop finish.  Brilliant.  Another beer well-done by Three Floyds.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3028,"2002-11-09",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2005 22 oz, waxed dipped bottle (first bottle release, fresh): resiny grapefruit aroma, sharp alcohol and thick pine.  Bubble gummy hop flavours with sticky chlorophyll and caramel hop juice.  Pine needles shape the finish and tasty hop-belches ensure quickly.  Not quite as good as I remember from the growlers I sampled, but perhaps 6-8 months in the bottle will solve that7/4/8/4/16

Growler, November 2002:  Deep cedar red.  Hoppy alcohol nose.  A deep warming eases the body and the mind, blissful thoughts fill my head as the caramel and fruit swirl in my mouth.  3 Floyds: please dont ever stop. 8/5/8/4/17","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"

3028,"2002-03-04",4.1,"3Fs can do no wrong, and this exemplifies the good things they do with beer: sweet toffee and grapefruit in the nose, and a well-struck balance between a big, sweet malt body and bitter/citrusy hops. Lingers nicely on the palate. Could have a fuller mouthfeel (though that might be rectified when not cask conditioned).","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
3028,"2002-03-04",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2004 2001; draft: Gooey, sappy, chewy malt  aroma with the hallmark Three Floyd's fruity hop combo. Vicious, sappy palate. Flavors match the aroma to a T with just enough underlying sappy, slightly bready malts. Zero trace of the abv. Absolutely juicy, explosive strawberry  esters expound on the palate. Stellar hop belches accompany the sticky malts at the finish. Gorgeous stuff.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3028,"2002-03-03",4.3,"My champ of the Real Ale Fest. Dont let anyone tell you that Pizza Port beath this, NO WAY! Malty with a dry finish. Alchohol is well covered. I need to compare this with Bells Third Coast Old Ale head to head.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
3028,"2002-02-08",4.4,"Wow! Three Floyds does it again. Had this on tap in Chicago and it was fabulous. Full of sweet carmel malt flavor, incredibly smooth. Hops balanced well by the malt. Not quite as good as Third Coast Old Ale but very close in my book.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

3028,"2000-12-10",4.3,"Well-balanced, but definitely leans towards the hop.  In fact, this may be the hoppiest barley wine I’ve ever
