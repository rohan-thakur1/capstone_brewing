615,"2017-05-30",4.0,"Can, by way of a trade. Very dark, clear, cola brown. Film and halo of dense, tan head. Nose has woody, earthy coffee grinds. Fresh coffee bean. Dark, cherry chocolate. Some vanilla pod. Some vine fruits. Taste has some lactic sweetness. Turns dry, and coffee bean bitter. Sticky mouthfeel. Pretty smooth, given the amount of coffee in here. Sticky sweet, and robust, earthy bitterness on the finish. Never my favourite style of beer, but I cant imagine it can get much better than this one.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"

615,"2016-02-29",3.7,"Can from jamesy -- what an extra! This is about as great as a milk stout can get. The idea of creating a milk coffee beer is a great one, but all of the lactose in this leaves it right on the edge of being cloyingly sweet. The coffee is really well chosen, giving the beer an impressive aroma and flavor, and the base stout is great too. Its just too sweet for my palate.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

The flavor is great. There is a heavy coffee and a nice milky sugar. There is a little chocolate and some strong roast. There is no pepper like I picked up in the aroma. There is a beautiful chocolate and nice coffee. The mouth feel is great. There is just enough lactose in there to keep it thick and creamy.

615,"2016-02-07",4.5,"Pours a pitch black color, with a small beige head.

Smells of roasted espresso beans with a pleasant chocolate sweetness to them. Coffee got both, an earthy rusticness and a toffee sweetness to it, creating an intriguing richness on the nose.

Has a medium carbonation among an utmost silk, soft mouthfeel, unfolding a great creaminess on the tongue.

Tastes of melting caramel, a gentle lactic whiff and a nutty earthiness. Its earth quality evolves to a richer state, as the beers roastiness unfolds. This gets wrapped up by silk milk chocolate a dry berry sourness and rock sugar. Finishes with a smooth, earth entangled sourness, still relying entirely on the profound coffee. 

Wow, this develops an incredible richness for its abv, exposing my tastebuds to the used coffee beans in an awesomely pleasant, silk yet intense way.","GERMANY","aleigator"
615,"2016-02-05",3.6,"750mL growler filled and drunk 1/30/16.Mocha-ebony body shows light clarity on the edges and a slow to form tan head eventually sits atop with moderate retention.At first its very heavy on the roast and seems to have a bit more beany character than Id prefer. This does eventually fade but Im still left with rich, heavy caramel macchiato-like characteristics. Dry vanilla and lightly burnt espresso notes help add balance and there is no alcohol or flaw.A very ""gritty"" and bready texture is the first thing I notice with heavy, loose carbonation and a watery finish despite some light syrupy character from the coffee and malt. Definitely sweet and decadent with vanilla, tons of espresso and milky caramel character. Gets better as it breathes and warms, but Im not finding anything incredibly compelling here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
