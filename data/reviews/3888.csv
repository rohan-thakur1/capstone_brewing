3888,"2017-06-22",3.8,"Can... Murky light-yellow pour with a tiny, white collar. The aroma features fuzzy stone fruits - pluot, peach and apricot - accompanied by a lighter note of biscuit malt. Light to medium-bodied and raspy with prickly carbonation. The flavor features grassy, herbal and peppery hops. This leans slightly toward the bitter side of balance, but is nicely rounded overall. Finishes grassy and Sahara-dry. Nice. Can courtesy of Brandon at Orchid Island Brewery!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3888,"2017-06-07",4.0,"pint can, courtesy and shared with Pierre T. Canned May 2nd 2017, 8h33.
Dorée/orangée assez trouble, col blanc crémeux.
Arôme au bouquet de jus pressé, rappel de pas mal dagrumes, mandarine, bouquet renforcé de fruits tropicaux avec une pointe de résineux en retrait.
Plais est bien houblonné, le tout bien amer avec ample apport dagrumes. Retrouve une petite douceur de mandarine, résineux, petite touche surette dananas (surement El Dorado) avec un effet épicé venant de la levure et dune impression de poudre dail.
Leffet de sécheresse est dautant plus accentué, base des Trillium, que cette dernière est double dry-hopper. Le malt ne joue quun rôle de balance et arrive en fin de bouche, pâle - caraMunich, en dessous de lapport des houblons.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

3888,"2017-05-23",3.8,"16oz can. Pours hazy pale golden yellow with a tiny white head. Aroma is pine, wood, grapefruit, lime, orange, grass, floral hops, and resin. Taste is pine, grapefruit, caramel, orange, floral, and a touch of lime. Lightly bitter. Alcohol in the finish. Medium body. Slightly prickly but average carbonation. Oily mouthfeel. Light astringency in the finish immediately after pouring, but it disappears after the beer settles. Very good, but I think I prefer the regular version of Sleeper Street - the mouthfeel is a little smoother and resonant.  The smaller aroma on the non-DDH version also allows the fruits to shine a little brighter.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"

Little to no malty caramel flavor so it is dominated by the smooth citrus/passion fruit. Very nice.

Then he asked if I liked Trillium, and I said Id never had it. He said he came into a 6-pack personally, and I could stop by the store the following day and pick up a can. I asked how much he wanted and he said nothing. The next day, work kept me from getting to the store while he was there. I called to tell him ""Thanks, but just drink it yourself"". Turns out he lives in my town and was willing to meet me when I got home to give me the can he originally offered. So, thanks Albi!

Taste is light bitter crisp and a bit of caramel sweetness but the El Dorado hop in this much quantity is super earthy resin like taking a big bite out of the ground in a pine forest.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3888,"2016-03-19",3.9,"750ml bottle in a tulip. Pours cloudy golden with a lacy, white head. Aroma of strong citrusy and floral and lightly spicy hops, some pale malts, and light dough. Flavor the same with strong hops but not my favorite hop. Average texture. A cool beer but not the best only because this hop isnt my favorite.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
3888,"2015-12-16",3.6,"Utterly cloudy, dull ochre-orange beer, with almost no head left. Very flowery, citrussy hop; grapefruit galore, Bergamot lime. Very bitter-resiny at first, but strangely enough also bitter chocolate, liquorice, rosewater, grapefruit, passion fruit and wheat. Finish is surprisingly mild, almost sweet, rosewater and lychee dominating. Bit astringent in the mouth, very dry-hopoily; slick. Sample probably no longer in the best condition; in any case surprising aromas and flavours.  Many thanks to Louis and Mathieu!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Hop spice lingers on. Nice balance of hop attributes here.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
3888,"2015-11-04",3.8,"Bottle thanks to bytemesis, split three ways. Pours like hazy pineapple juice with decent head. This beer is something of an enigma to me. On alternating sips I either loved it (had this really cool sweet orange blossom creamsicle juice thing going on) or was disappointed by it (""green,"" a little too sweet, more caramel showing than I like, not enough balancing bitterness). But then that orange blossom creamcicle thing would happen again and Id think, ""damn ... I get it, this is delicious."" And then Id lose it again -- like one of those optical illusion posters I used to stare at as a kid. So depending on which mode Im in, this is either like a 4.1 or 3.5, so Im going to average it out to a 3.8. Definitely one of the more puzzling beers Ive had in a while, which is a lot of fun.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

3888,"2015-10-20",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2015 750mL bottled on 10/0X/15 (cant quite make it out), drunk very fresh on 10/20/15.Large rocky white head atop a moderately hazy, but thankfully not cloudy, pale golden liquid with plentiful carbonation. Retention is strong. Another perfect appearance as usual.Tons of lemon, guava, moderate leafiness of the hops but not altogether quite as deeply tropical as the regular version. Not that thats a bad thing. This one is still highly aromatic, but with some deeper, more dank and at the same time starker citrusy notes. So its a bit of an odd one, the bright, sharp, nearly tart lemony citrus notes combined with the more earthy, spicy, floral notes. Still, works perfectly fine and I like that there are no obtuse pine or grapefruit notes. No alcohol and very sparse (though ample) malts in the nose providing biscuits, crackers and a touch of sourdough.Bitter lemon and lime, with some sourdough-like malt notes (or is that just some tangy hop resin? hard to tell), dry, acidic pineapple and melon and honey on the finish. Hmmm, interesting. The attenuation is clearly spot-on (tending perhaps a touch sweet, but its appropriate to balance), just like in the regular version. The hops are a bit more dubious here, for me, however. Very dry and bitter, with some Galaxy-like notes (I say Galaxy-like when I get a very fuzzy, acidic, almost capsaicin-like feel from the hops). It definitely hits hard on the end, giving just a bit more tanginess/punchiness than Id like, especially in the face of the acidity and dryness. Some more lighthearted mango, papaya and even some sweet pineapple could work wonders here. Its odd to think the normal and ddh versions could be that much different, but I certainly am not nearly as impressed by what the dry hopping has done here. That being said, its still an excellent, drinkable IPA with classic Trillium texture/carbonation (perfect).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3888,"2015-10-17",3.8,"22oz bottle via trade. It pours a cloudy dark orange / amber color with a medium white head. Aroma is rich bold sweet hops with notes of tropical fruits and pungent dank weed.

Smells good; juicy, piney, bitter, and floral hops with a mild to moderately bittersweet backbone. A bit of caramel as well, but its mild and well-balanced, and doesnt detract from the hops.  Tastes like it smells with a pleasant medium-bodied mouthfeel. Some spruce and lemongrass on the tongue as well. A good IPA.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

3888,"2015-04-18",3.6,"Live from NH. Bottle (750 ml). Bottles on 17-04-2015, so 1 day old. From Jon, thanks! Split 3-ways with Chris and Julien.

Appearance: Muddy glowing yellow with a medium easy to revive white head and good lacing.

Aroma: Oh that is weird... its a burst of a mix of lemongrass and spicy wood like spruce. Theres also some mangoes and honeyed notes. 

Taste: Its as weird as the aroma with lemongrass, spruce, a good malt backbone and a very low bitterness level. Sweetness is rather low too.

Palate: Medium body. Moderate to medium carbonation. A bit oily and with the usual Trillium mouthfeel depth. A bit dry. 

Overall: The body is nice and the base beer seems to be really good but the front aroma/flavors of lemongrass and spruce is just to weird so the drinkability/enjoyability is hindered.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Aroma is a bit more malt forward than the GFP, with sweet notes of honey and melon, mango, pineapples, tropical citrus. Flavor is sweet papaya and melon, some pineapple in the background, low bitter and higher on the sweetness. Medium bodied, medium low carbonation, dank and more syrupy than the others (not in a bad way). Some interesting malty bready flavors lingering on the finish. A good bit of offerer from others from Teillium that Ive had this far. Almost like sweet melon juice and the hops are surprisingly mellow here given the supposed large dry hop.
