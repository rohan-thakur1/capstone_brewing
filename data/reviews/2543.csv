2543,"2016-08-26",3.5,"Bottled (thanks Perc!). Black colour, small brown head. Aroma is roasted, some syrup. Malax limpa quite much. Flavour is malax limpa (syrupy rye bread), and some slight tartness. Quite ok.","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"
2543,"2016-08-18",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Deep raisins, dark rye bread and earthen spices suffuse this expressive Kali, leading to a sugary finish awash in bubbles.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam decorates the mahogany-hued brown.
-This is obviously quite sweet, but its profile is captivating enough to make it worth drinking a full bottle.
-Rye flavors are nicely laid out.
-Even smelling the bottle is pleasant.

2543,"2015-08-26",2.5,"Tastes much like the ordinary A le Coq Kali. That means its a nice sweet drink thats good to take on a hot summer day. A bit darker though. Nothing so ""Imperial"" about it, just a fancy bottle. Drinkable","","Ollemies"

Flavor is sweet, malt roast, metallic notes, rye bread, citric notes. Finish has even some rye spiciness.

2543,"2014-09-10",2.4,"Bottle as pictured. Pours clear, dark brown with fizzzy, coca-cola like head. Aroma of bread, yeast and some caramel.

2543,"2014-09-10",2.3,"0,5L fancy glass bottle. The usual brown body with a tiny head. Smooth bready taste with medium sweetness. Citric finish from the excessive use of citric acid. Quite generic, something between their ""Tume Kali"" and regular ""Kali"". Not as raisiny or roasty as Id like my kali or kvass to be. Imperial Kvass could be an interesting concept - thick and heavy like an Imperial Stout but with about 2-3% of alcohol.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","thirstyrabbit"
