3396,"2017-06-17",4.6,"Almanacs prestigious, upscaled (very) strong Flemish red, second edition, 2016 vintage bottle. A clear nod to Rodenbach Grand Cru, arguably the archetype in this old style - even the letters are suspiciously similar to those of Rodenbach, but this is an ambitious and complex elaboration on the theme of aged oud bruin, with added Californian Zinfandel grapes, raspberries and vanilla beans. From a luxurious 75 cl champagne bottle covered with an almost baroque motif and further provided with a classy hangtag with a Jack Kerouac quote on the backside - this whole thing looks chic and sophisticated, even a bit over-the-top in its ornamentation - and expensive. I think Im in for a treat today... Irregular, tightly cobweb-lacing, very moussy, even frothy, pale greyish white head, irregularly breaking in the middle but dense and stable on the edge, crowning a misty, beautifully vermillion-hued copper-bronze coloured beer, glowing in the sun, but turning completely clouded and more brownish burgundy with sediment, still very coppery though, like a jar of home-made quince jam. The nose reveals finesse, power and complexity upon opening the bottle, a whole array of well-matched impressions: first a whiff of elusive vanilla (from the vanilla beans), piercing through the nostrils but then shyly hiding in the background, immediately followed by somewhat more robust odours of tart raspberries and raspberry vinegar, even a cherry tomato-ish accent linked to them, soaking wet oak wood, rosé champagne, spicy and jammy Zinfandel wine indeed, redcurrant, oloroso, apple crumble, unsugared quince jam, maracuja, forest fruit yoghurt, sherry vinegar, yellow plums, some wry grape skin, soggy bread, krieken op jenever (gin-aged cherries), hints of violets, blueberries, damp earth (stronger with sediment, eventually even adding a very subtle urine-like aspect), Parfait dAmour, white rum, nectarine, rose petals. A ton of lush rosy and purple fruitiness instantly fills the mouth, both from the esters that befit a Flemish red and from the double added fruit dosis; I get a big wave of red raspberries as well as - a couple of seconds later and a bit deeper - sweet and spicy Zinfandel grapes, mixing well with each other and with the esters, the latter of which add impressions of ripe nectarine, red apple, redcurrant and a dash of pomegranate. The generously sweet fruit flavours are embedded in a beautiful tartness, drying and elegantly sour without becoming too acidic, with a hint of fruit peel wryness; mouthfeel is just perfect, smooth and soft, with finely tingling, lambrusco-like carbonation which only enhances the flavours rather than covering them up. The fruit wave travels onwards over a lovely bready and even very lightly caramelly malt sweetish basis, while the overall tartness keeps it dry and extremely appetizing; the finish accentuates this dryness with elegant wood tannins, releasing vanilla-ish notes - and this is where the added vanilla beans make their contribution, in subtly working together with the much more dim vanilla-ish properties of the oak, volatile and gracious; the wood never becomes overly expressive, as would be the case in the finest of authentic Flemish reds (think Rodenbach Vintage, for example). At 10+% ABV, it comes as no surprise that a late glow of soft, sherry-like alcohol joins in at the very end, mingling with the ongoing fruit tartness, fruit juiciness, soft tannic woodiness and malt sweetishness. The fruit tartness lasts the longest after swallowing. My, this is a thing of sheer beauty... I was expecting something worthwile (also given the price and the other beers I had from this brewery), but this exceeds my expectations. This may well be the best oud bruin I ever had - including the original Flemish examples, and I hate to admit this. It understands the essence of this difficult and complicated, (now) highly revered style much better than almost any other non-Flemish oud bruin I had so far; the craft beer movement is all about experimenting with existing beer styles, reviving old styles that were all but forgotten, mixing them into hybrids and creating new ones so it is no wonder that so many of these new generation brewers throughout the world want to tackle this ancient - and originally relatively humble - European sour beer style, especially given the sour craze that has been going on in recent years, but many of them get stuck in sourness too much, forgetting about the soft, bready, moelleux maltiness this style needs to truly shine. This ones does it completely right, and adds further complexity with grapes, raspberries and vanilla in a well-thought and well-balanced manner. An absolute must for whoever likes this original sour ale style. I had no idea Almanac was capable of this degree of awesomeness... Justly a top-50 oud bruin here.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3396,"2017-02-05",4.4,"Oaky woody dark fruit aroma with nice lactic finish. Sour is maybe 5 of 10 sour, all lactic. Great dark fruit complexity, cherry, fig dark fruit woody complexities. Has less body than I expected for a stronger sour, and a bit of an almost syrupy cherry sweetness to the finish. Those are minor though, it is complex and balanced and flavorful. Alcohol is masked very well. Cherry woody sour is the dominant flavor. Really nice. Was expecting a world class beer like consecration and it is a notch below. Great sour, but not world class. Has a rose wine like feel to it due to high alcohol and lighter body.

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy/acidic yeast, fruit/vanilla, oak barrel, and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/tannic/sourness balance, and zero puckering/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness for acidity/tannins, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and acidic/tannic/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 10.5%. Overall this is an incredible fruited sour ale! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy/acidic yeast, fruit/vanilla, oak barrel, and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on, thanks to the balanced acidity and wine/oak tannins.
