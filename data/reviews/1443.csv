1443,"2015-11-20",3.3,"Where and how:  at brewpub 
Aroma: medium intense, nice rounded malts. Hops tad subdued. This one is more malt sided
 Appearance : 
Top: medium white cap.
Base: hazy amber
Palate : medium-thin bodied. Dry, with average finish. Good drinkability.
Taste: First things first. Its far too dry to be Alt. malty character was more evident in aroma. Taste presented to me as more of a saison/de garde in style with hits of Alt. 
 other notes  interesting hybrid, yet I wished to see more Alt in Alt.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"

>> Thanks DTF. Clear, light amber pour with okay white foam. Nose is dark cherry, alcohol, fig. Taste is light bodied, a bit watery, somewhat quenching given this style. Mildly bitter, mild lemon, not at all sticky. Seems to be balanced but not too expressive. Maybe one to pursue and tweak. Cant say Ive ever had a great Altbier.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
