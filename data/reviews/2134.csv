2134,"2012-05-22",2.8,"Aroma is peppery, a hint of latex to it oddly, some pine but its quite subtle this one. Flavour is unbalanced; while some sweet malt manages to noise its way in initially its suddenly trampled by abrasive, harsh, peppery rampaging hop bitterness. Some suggestions of complexity beneath it all exist, but the overarching impression isnt too pleasing. An acrid, bitter finish sticks around, concluding a beer that outstays its welcome. Not awful, but definitely not up to scratch.","York, North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","omegamike"

I foolishly ordered a Mikkeller dry stout first up, but the hop aroma from Marcs Carnival just drifted across the table and destroyed the Mikkeller offering. Ordering better next time, a slightly orange/amber coloured beer, with very juicy aromatic citrus hop character, more orange/tangerine than grapefruit so a little sweeter than some.

Hazy gold in colour with slim white head, really sessionable stuff, the hops and citrus flavours show but perhaps this facet it is a little more restrained than with some of their other offerings, nice though and would be lovely just to sit back and have a few of these.
