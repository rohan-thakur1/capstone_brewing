783,"2007-02-14",3.9,"Pours a cloudy medium brown, with almost no head. No lacing. Light spiciness in the aroma.

Awesome flavor. Full bodied maltiness - wheat and grain and caramel and mild honey. This is accompanied by some prominent fruit and spice character. Actually, the flavor is somewhat simlar to a fine Belgian dubbel. The tart plum in the finish is fantastic. Mildly hopped, lightly carbonated.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
783,"2004-12-23",3.3,"Tap 8/2004.  Hazy semi-luminous dark amber.  Rather reminiscent of the appearance of many fantome beers.  Apple clove aroma.  Good german hefe yeast profile.  Intense cloviness.  Minimal roast/dark malt character.  Long wheaty-sticky sweet finish.  Seems more hefe-amber than hefe-dunkel to me.  I like the yeast profile though.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
783,"2004-08-10",3.9,"Wheaty aroma. Smells like the Dunkel Weizens I had in Germany. Dirty dishwater brown but with a nice amber hue. Small, off-white head and virtually no lace. Banana notes are present in the palate. Has a little bit of a salty finish. Good wheat flavor. A solid and quality brew.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
783,"2004-07-31",3.0,"Murky, dark orange pour, Candy sweet aroma with a bit of fresh lake water underneath. Has a bit of a thin mouthfeel. Flavor has bits of sweet chocolate with cloves and bananas making their presence known in the back end. Yast make itself known as well. A bit too carbonoted and thin for my palate. All around decent though.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
783,"2004-07-27",3.9,"On-tap at the brewpub: Strange murky fudgesicle brown color, soft and thin beige head, no real lacing sticks, just some drippings sliding back into the fluffy collar. Aroma is slightly dullish lemon rind spice, very slight clove, fruity dark and plummy with touches of earthy yeast giving peet moss or wet dirt nuances. Taste is full, round, and fruity, interesting tang of caramel malts and dark juicy fruits, bringing plum, berries, dark cherries, mandorine orange, its nearly a frickin fruit salad its so juicy. Spices mingle within quite well bringing bits of clove, pepper, lemon rinds, ginger, and earth. Never overly spicy, it always makes its presense felt in all the right areas. Very subtle and complex. Great flavors in this one. Strong and sweet. Yum. Feel is a bit shy of medium with a fluffy texture and carbonation, much like any hefe, but here the malty rich profile and fruity tang helps it keep it interesting. Even though I enjoyed the hell out its flavors, I had a hard time getting through this glass of beer. I think the overall beefy tangyness kept me from fully engaging quaffability. Still...quite good stuff.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
783,"2004-07-23",3.9,"Very good but not what I expect from a dunkel.  Lots of fresh fruit and spice.  The wheat is there.  Sweet and very smooth.  I would say it was a hefeweizen if it wasnt dark.  One of Town Halls better efforts.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
783,"2004-07-20",3.7,"Brown Coloring.  No Head.  Malt, Some Wheat.  Malty Aftertaste.. Sweet/Smooth. Not a Bad Beer.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
783,"2004-07-20",3.8,"Cloudy, light brown color with a tad of a head.  Nose suggests a few hops and wheat.  The taste has the maltiness and wheat one would expect, but it is much sweeter than I thought it would be.  Also very creamy.  Quite nice!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
783,"2004-07-19",4.0,"I usually dont drink wheat beers, but I appreciate what they have to offer. This Dunkelweizen was a complete treat to behold. Slightly hazy, with a nose of plum and wheat. The taste was that of the same, supported by a beefy heft. This has me rethinking my usual avoidance of this style...","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","BitterPoet"
783,"2004-07-15",4.0,"This is different from that other dunkel weizen listed here, for it was recently formulated by the new assistant brewer, and is named for an actor who frequents the pub, and has performed Shakespeare at local stages.
Appearance: very cloudy, near opaque, with a light brown, near-violet hue, almost plummy, but closer to a dark orange...matches well with the better dunkels Ive encountered, and their colors are hard to pin as well. Good, fuzzy, beigish head.
Aroma: soft, yet spicy, hints of clove, cinnamon, ginger, very earthy, but still light and lively. Dark fruits also start speak in the nose, but not too loudly, theyre waiting for the...
Taste? spicy little entry on the palate,minor hops, lush malt, and now the fruity content makes some noise. Plums, raisins, berries, but above all grapes, still paired up with lively spices. This is very tasty, impressively flavorful, and so smooth and easy going down. Medium bodied, it feels like a weizen, but the flavor gives a different kind of refreshment. Id definitely choose this over the regular Hefe Weizen, which is still on tap. Excellent texture, sweet, lightly spicy, just-delicious-enough, long finish.  Theyve got another good one here, Ill be slurping them up for the remainder of the summer!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
