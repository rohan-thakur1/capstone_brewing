3502,"2016-09-10",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Deeply roasted malts and their burnt edges benefit from fruity currents, meeting up with toasted bread lengths and slight acidity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the brown-edged blackness.
-Mouthfeel is surprisingly effervescent.
-Green hop bitterness is rising with every sip.
-Dark chocolate is also found, in the 90% cocoa range.
-The roasted malt acidity, surely emboldened by the high carbonation, works well to counterbalance the finish. 
-This is what I imagine old London Porter to have tasted like.
-Another fine malt-accented brew from Partizan!
