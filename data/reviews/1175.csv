1175,"2017-05-16",4.3,"16 oz can. Pours a very hazy golden orange color and capped by a small off white layer of foam that settles into thin film. The aroma is really nice and shows notes of very juicy orange, tangerine, pineapple, and peach with a soft biscuit malt base and hints of citrus and grassy hops. The flavor follows and is very juicy with huge waves of orange, tangerine, and pineapple citrus fruit to go with the soft biscuit and caramel malts. Pillowy mouthfeel with soft bitterness on the back end. Just a beautiful bouquet of citrus and tropical fruit juices. Medium bodied and very smooth with soft carbonation that leads to a juicy citrus finish with very little lingering bitterness. Just really well executed as this drinks more like a single than a double ipa. Really tasty stuff here. Awesome beer. I hope to get more of this.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

A heavily hazy, nearly soupy amber-golden body topped by a medium-sized white head that fades quickly to cover.Juice, juicy fruit sweetness and...well....more juice and tropical fruits. Ya, this is not screaming complexity, but the mango-papaya-cherry-pineapple is about as good as yourre going to find. No edge to it whatsoever and only sweet honey-like base malts hang in the background. No booze or flaw.In the flavor its incredibly soft, malty and gently sweet while still maintaining good attenuation. Just a phenomenally tropical juice bomb with moderate cherry character as well. Low but ultra-tight carbonation and low bitterness with no resin or pine. No booze here and no flaw. Just massively juicy hop notes, soft, creamy-malty carbonation-texture and just a nip of bitterness to balance. Pretty f-in good.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1175,"2016-01-22",4.1,"Poured from a can. 
Aroma is nice with some medium light cracker malt notes. A lot of hop character with grapefruit and tropical fruit leading the way followed by dank notes with some onion character. Some light resin notes as well as stone fruit. 
Pours a murky, pale, golden straw color with a moderately tall, medium thick, white head that exhibits nice retention as it recedes to a thin film that lingers. Moderate lacing with small legs. 
Flavor has a semi light sweetness with medium cracker malt notes that initially linger in the finish. Medium high bitterness that also lingers. Moderately strong hop flavors with nice tropical fruit and citrus notes. Less grapefruit and dank, onion, notes than in the aroma, but they are still present and balance out the tropical fruit. Some lingering sweet tropical fruit notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.

Aroma of dank hops, then a citrus overtone followed by a malt push. Picked up at the brewery on the 2/21/15 release. Hoppy prevalations succeed, then theres a modest yet pushy malt profile that brings down the juicy hops. A liberator perhaps? Citrus canopy delivers the rest.

1175,"2015-03-27",4.0,"Roughly week-old can poured into HF glass. Pours a very pale hazy straw color, small head, small ring of lacing. Aroma is super juicy and tropical, and very dank, too: mango and lychee lead the way followed by sweet orange, cantaloupe, honey, candied lemon, white grape, fresh-cut grass, flowers, resin. Taste is extremely fruity as well but with some alcohol apparent and aggressive pine and resin, though only moderate bitterness: piney sweet orange and candied grapefruit along with mango, piña colada, and a super resinous/dank/herbal finish. Bitterness builds to an aggressive level with more sips. Definitely a notch above most beers in its category, though the booze and bitterness make it less refined than the best of the Northeast. Still, a solid offering  Heady lovers, take note.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
1175,"2015-03-27",3.8,"Thanks Blue_rogue. 
This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a glazed over yellow/slight orange color. The head dissipated immediately. Light lacing stuck only around the glass. 
The smell had a wonderful sweet to lightly spiced combination of raw piney and grapefruit. Adequately enthralled with the substance of the bitter sweet citrus hops, a light burst of sweet onion runs into the aroma and blends wonderfully. 
The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and amplifies to flavor. Theres no aftertaste nor finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation hits like a good DIPA should but still isnt overbearing. A lingering semi - soft bitter dryness rolls over my tongue. 
Overall, I say this was a very good DIPA that I would love to have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Aroma of pineapple and mango, deer honey, some pine, lots if citrus fruits and sweet pineapple. Mmm. Flavor follows with sweet pineapple notes, honey, but plenty of bitterness to balance the rich creaminess of the sweet tropical fruit: mango, pineapple, and some citrus peel. Creamy body, medium to medium low carbonation. This is good.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
1175,"2015-02-05",4.1,"16 oz. can thanks to Willrunforbeer in a recent trade. Aroma is what I look for in a DIPA. Light tropical fruit, light dank weed, light scallions. 
Body has a nice sweet malt body to balance the huge hop character. Candied mango, juicy grapefruit and a mild lingering dank grass note. Bitterness is large but not completely overwhelming like some other lesser DIPAs can do. No palate fatigue with this bad boy. Bold yet a level of smoothness. Mild citrus rind with some fresher cut grassy note after the sip. Damn, Bissell is killing it with these recipes lately. Looks like another trip to Portland is in order soon. Finely crafted.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
