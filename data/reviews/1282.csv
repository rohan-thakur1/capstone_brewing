Very floral, perhaps too sweet but nice sharp finish.  Mineral feel coats rof of mouth.  Head lasts to bottom.  Beautiful beer.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1282,"2005-07-16",3.9,"RBSG Cask
Average size head on a clear medium amber body.
Good aroma of malt and hops.
As it passes over your tongue, you first get a milt malt sweetness and then a perfectly balanced hop bitterness follows. Nice dry overall palate. Well done ESB.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

1282,"2005-07-13",3.6,"RBSG 2005. Dark amber body, moderate fluffy white head. Nice hoppy aroma, with resin prominent. Hoppy bitterness is well balanced with just enough malt to support the dominant hops. Palate is noticeably thin but is within range for a cask beer. Nice beer that I could see myself consuming in quantity if DDC was my local.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

1282,"2005-04-20",3.2,"On cask at Dieu du Ciel with MartinT joined by Beerbuzzmontreal and his friend, 4/16/05.  Orange-amber beer, with strong notes of raspberry red.  Small off-white/beige colored head with little retention.  Chill haze to the body.  Aroma of crystal malt, some dry grains and a big yeasty fruitiness.  Low bittering hops, but quite floral and aromatic in the nose, provide an enticing first glance.  The flavor is very even, with light fruits, some moderately toasted grains, spots of crystal malt here and there and a dry, floral hops fruitiness lingering on the finish, with light notes of coffee and dry caramel.  Watery on cask, though not offensively so, this seemed an English-American hybrid, but true to the brewery, was quite well-done, if somewhat unremarkable, and very drinkable.  Medium body, overall quite dry.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1282,"2005-01-08",3.7,"[cask] Almost clear brown, with a bubbly cask-served head.  It was kind of smokey in the bar to sense aroma but there was definitely american hops--and they were a bit citrusy but heavily pine scented.  Excellent hops flavour that was only a little grassy.  The hight hops aroma/flavour left me expecting a punch of puckering bitterness, but it never came.  Moderate bitterness with a light to medium body and a clean feel.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

Your mouth tingles as you drink in her citric, creamy, almost chalky essence. Suddenly this smooth encounter is coming to an end, and, perhaps feeling like you consumumed her to quickly, she slowly walks away leaving a beatifully thirst-quenching albeit lingering bitter feeling. Beleive it or not I think that meeting her after just moments after having a passionate love affair with her cousine, La Quintesence, helped me impression. she was the perfect, fresh tonic to cleanse the palate.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"

Oh, wait, those are important too...and unfortunately this is a bit bland; Englishy mild hops and a musty-dusty caramel are fine, but there's just not a whole lot there.  Extra points overall for the velvet tongue though.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
