882,"2017-05-30",4.0,"720 ml bottle. Big nose or rice, peaches, melon, oranges, spices. Crisp and fruity flavor, huge fruit, quite full body for such a high polishing ratio. Nice rice, awesome fruit, not as light as expected, peppery. Great stuff, though maybe not so much better than the 50 to justify double the price.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
882,"2016-04-22",3.4,"Quick flight prior to TriBeCa film fest. Fine looking and nose of light melons and coconut. Tastes of honey dew, coconut, yeast, rice and jelly beans. Touch hot but smooth enough","New York, USA","Jow"
882,"2015-05-03",4.2,"Bottle 300 ml thanks to Ingo! Sampled on May 3, 2015.Where the only text I understood was ""Dassai 23"", also something like 23% and the number 16, guessing the ABV?Could also see a web address for asahishunzo.ne.jp on the label.Light purple paper cover over the neck, tied with some purple string as well. This bottle had sat in Ingos fridge for about one year, and since Ive understood sake should drink fresh, we were not expecting much whn this was opened.Pours very clear pale birch sap color, almost completely colorless, or towards water. No head but generous thick legs pointing towards a high alcohol content. Fantastic fresh lychee, Japaneese pear, fruity scent. Sweet, alcohol, Japaneese pear taste. Rather dry bitter alcohol finish. Full mouthfeel. Much warming alcohol.Very nice drink!Has held up really well and could possibly be the best sake Ive yet to sample.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
882,"2015-04-13",4.0,"Ive drunk numerous sakes, first time rating. not sure how to rate appearance and palate. The dassai 23 has exceptionally low proportion of the rice remaining. ????23%?this makes it incredibly smooth and drinkable ????? but perhaps with less aroma and character than their not quite as smooth 50 daiginjo. nevertheless this is a great sake.","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
882,"2014-10-26",2.9,"Bottle.

A- Slightly sweet, soft green apples, alcohol.

A- White color, clear liquid, no head. 

T- Melons, green apple, dry, crisp, alcohol, slightly sweet.

P- Light body, thin texture, average carbonation, sharp finish,

O- The best sake Ive had but really doesnt taste much different from any other. A little drier and less alcohol burn but certainly not worth the $100/bottle price.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"
882,"2014-07-27",3.0,"Sake flight sampled at Sakagura with Linh and Zahra. Pours a clear, still body. Doesnt really deviate too far from the standard sake in my mind; notes of grassy fresh melon, rice, wine, alcohol and maybe some faint additional fruits in the back. A bit too hot for my personal preference, but not awful.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
882,"2013-09-29",2.9,"Tasting at Astor Wines. Just called ""Dassai 23"" in Merica. I had to put on the puppy dog eyes for this one after it ""ran out"".

Pretty purple paper neck wrap. Sake was clear & still.

Super subtle, a little disappointing. Similar profile to the 39, but just more airy & delicate(re:restrained). Maybe more banana then apple this time, and definitely no where near as hot. Earthy yeast.

Flavor is tiptoeing apple acidity & powdered sugar dusted pineapple sweetness. Just a twinge of complimenting bitterness that is very neutral. Light to moderate starch. A little watery, yet slick.

I trust what I can taste & smell, but I  probably took too big a baby step with this one.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
882,"2012-03-17",3.5,"In bottle at Craigs. Pours a slightly yellow, clear colour. A distinct aroma of Bertie Bassetts blue bobbly brim, coconut and alcohol. Similar liquorice, coconut and alcohol flavours. Tasty.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Benjii"
882,"2012-03-17",3.8,"Bottle at cgarvieuks. Clear pour. Big aniseed, slight pineapple, pretty rough alcohol nose. A distinct note of Bertie Bassetts blue bobbly brim. Slightly aniseed palate, but some juicy coconut also. Finish is surprisingly clean considering the nose.","SCOTLAND","dantheman278"
