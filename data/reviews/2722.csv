2722,"2016-09-27",3.5,"Bottle from Den Nordiske Ølhandel, Copenhagen; 5.3% ABV; bb 17/04/14Cloudy golden color with small creamy head. The aroma is initially very fresh, hoppy, fruity, although some of that goes away quite quickly. The mouthfeel is a bit too weak and dry; the malt flavor has a cereals accent, and there is also some chamomile and very light bergamot; correct bitterness, with some citrus fruits and lime-tree; the final is dry and almost astringent.Good beer, although not as much as the Summer Edition. Finally I was able to find this, but the price tag at Den Nordiske Ølhandel is quite high (about the double that Systembolaget).","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

Dorée, blanche.
Maltée et grillée avec une très belle pointe de café. Houblon reste en retrait et donne à cette bière un caractère amer surprenant et agréable le tout sur un medley de fruit tropicaux. On peut à la limite reconnaître une signature de fabrique de De Proef.
Cest rafraichissant et trop facile à boire.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
