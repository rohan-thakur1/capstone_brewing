829,"2013-11-17",3.7,"12 oz bottle. The pour is a pretty good looking bright gold, like you'd expect in a pilsner. It's not really clear, and the head is pretty thin, but leaves great lace.

829,"2013-11-13",4.0,"12oz bottle, big thanks to umich03jm. Few things in life I love more than fresh, unrated Shorts at my doorstep... One of the classiest looking shorts labels Ive ever seen, really nice-looking. Mostly clear yellow color. Very fine particles visible suspended in the body. Very nice ridges and spreads of lace. Good-looking beer, with the label to complement. Medium-plus body. Smooth, crisp, lighter carbonation, with a more dry finish. Great grassy hop aroma, bready, lightly peppery full pilsenery malt base, nice light lemon citrus. Great, big long pilsnery aftertaste. Pilsen malt really shines here; its a showcase of everything good about pilseners. Good moderate to bigger bitter taste, light to moderate sweetness, all in balance. No hint of the bigger alcohol in the taste, just a nice, more full body and bigger flavor. This manages to be a slightly bigger, more fuller flavored pils without being over the top hoppy and not at all hot, very impressive. Still true to style but big enough to qualify as imperial. It pretty much amps everything up I love about a good pils, and yet still manages to be very drinkable and quite refreshing. Maybe Im a shorts fanboy, maybe Im just in a beer mood, but this has got to be one of the most perfect imperial pilseners Ive ever tried... very well done in all aspects.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
829,"2013-11-08",3.9,"Bottled 9/17/13 and poured into a shaker pint.

Appearance: A cloudy ""pure"" yellow color. Pure yellow with nothing else there. Half finger or so of head bubbles away pretty quickly leaving a wispy bit of foam on top. Not much lacing.

Smell: As expected, smelling quite sweet. Like sugar and hay, mostly. Almost a fruity characteristic as well. Quite nice on the nose.

Taste/feel: First sip I didnt care for much, but then I realized I had brushed my teeth half an hour earlier. Once that first sip got my teeth re-dirtified, I was ready to go. The taste is much like the smell. This really is just what I had expected coming into this beer. Take an Pilsner with an average ABV (five or so), and add sweetness. Very low bitterness for me. I think this is 50 IBUs, but its balanced well. Sweet from beginning to end with that hay flavor typical to a good Pilsner, with almost a juiciness from fruit. Mouthfeel is medium with a medium amount of carbonation, making this pretty dangerously drinkable. Im going to shock some people by saying that I thought there was some corn in the flavor in a way, but Im not too sure. Whether they use corn or not (Id THINK not) in this beer, I get that vibe. Regardless, a super enjoyable beer.

The beer is light yellow hued with a mild haze. The head is long lasting, leaving ample lacing on the glass. 

The aroma brings some hops, sweetness, citrus, and alcohol. The flavor is really enjoyable. 

A quality beer from Shorts. Reminiscent of an American IPA to some degree, as the hop profile stands out more so than the malt bill.

4.0 A: Hazed golden yellow color. Nearly four fingers of white, pillowy head. Retention is pretty good and it leaves a strange lattice of lacing.

3.5 S: This smells like it was jam packed with orange peel and lemon rind. Simply tons of it floating into my nostrils. Grassy and lightly spicy hops. Far from clean, but not too muddled with yeastiness. Bready and somewhat floral overall.

2.0 T: The taste, however, is a bit too muddled. Full of yeastiness with too much bread and biscuit. Grassy, earthy hops give a bitterness that is just too strong for the style. Orange peel and lemon rind are back, but they fall behind too many intense, but unwanted flavors. This is not what I want from a pilsner, whether imperial or not.

2.5 M: Heavier medium body from the intense yeastiness. Good moderate carbonation. Chewy without being equally creamy. Far from smooth with a bitter aftertaste.

2.0 D: This is the antithesis of what I would want from the style. Heavy, overly bready and yeasty, and far from clean. Not refreshing at all and otherwise not satisfying.

829,"2011-04-16",3.6,"Bottle, 
this beer has a clear gold pour (a little darker, fuller gold color than your typical lager-pilsner) and gave a one to two finger white head that deflated to a cover and ring after a few minutes, the effervescence was light in this beer, a gentle single stream of bubbles in the center of the glass, and left spots and layers of lacing on the glass, there was a partial film of sediment on the bottom of the bottle, 

the aromas were light toasted malt, a citrus sour that resembles lemon with cracker and bread like aromas, 

the flavors were light malt, bread, grain, and has a good sour touch on the tongue, there is little sweetness in this beer at first part of the sip, 
the hops add a gentle bitterness and works well with the sourness of the beer to give a good finish, 

the mouth feel is around medium, it may feel a little thicker than medium but it feels light for an Imperial Pilsner, 

the alcohol is hidden well in this beer and it is not overly sweet like some, a nice ESL.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

For some reason I thought this would be a great thing to buy when at Bella Vino.  Instead it was an acceptable ""imperial pilsener"" that was not worth the $15.99. If you have a bottle share it with others soon because it did not seem like the sort of beer that will age well.
Aroma / Appearance - A huge billowing head filled my glass with mostly foam before it settled into a golden hued body.  Wheat, grain and white bread formed a bland nose that left me a little bored.  I expected something slightly stronger from a pilsener.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was thick and chewy as expected but the flavors were dulled down.  Wonder bread drizzled in honey with a slight tartness and mildly funky finish was not complex at all.  In fact at some point it became cloying.  I was glad to see the glass empty by the end of the sample.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Theres something here that slightly reminds me of High Life... and Im not sure it doesnt work here.  Rather bitter, but not so fruity hops.  A bit of tuttifruiti though.  Jucier as it warms.

829,"2007-06-01",3.4,"750 mL bottle-tag says 4-20-06.  Boy, if price and packaging is indicative, this should be out of this world.  Comes in a big bottle, nice label, an attached tag with information and the like... fancy.  The original price on this was $20, so theyre obviously pretty proud of it, too.  I got a nice closeout deal on it... 5 bucks.  Figured it might be worth trying at that price.  Pour is pretty nice... golden color with some amber shades.  Head on the first glass was about three fingers and its dying down as I type, leaving lots of nice lacing on the side of the glass.  Aromas are interesting and somewhat unique... lemon peel, grass, floral hops and maybe a touch of grapefruit hiding in the background.  Its not an overpowering nose, but pleasant.  First impression of the flavor is that the alcohol is a little out of balance and takes it in an astringent direction without enough of a malt body to support it well.  It seems like as it sits and breathes a little it is becoming a little more managable.  Flavors are still a little bitter, though.  Lemon peels and summer grass are my best description, with that alcoholic unbalance pulling things away from purely enjoyable.  Still, nice.
