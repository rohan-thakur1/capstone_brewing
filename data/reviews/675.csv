675,"2015-12-07",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2015 Large shared bottle.
Wow, this is really great. A relatively heavy load of bourbon and bourbon barrel flavors but these are of exceptional quality (apparently, Heaven Hill) and blend nicely with the other components.
Smooth medium body.
Alcohol is evident bit seems much lower than 12% due to the mildly warm feel and smoke bourbon flavor.
Highly recommended.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
