4333,"2016-03-02",3.9,"Pours cloudy amber with a bunch of chunkies in it. There is a quickly diminishing medium tan head with average legs. Nose is apricot, malt, dates. Malt forward flavor, boozy, big, lots of hops. Very mildly astringent at the end with a bit of charcoal. Slightly chalky mouthfeel. It is pretty good. I have a complaint about the bottle... the stupid wax or plastic they sealed it with is very difficult to remove. I cut myself TWICE on two separate bottles.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","jgentgesdo"

4333,"2014-07-15",4.6,"Poured this bomber into a Prairie Dino Flute -- Pours a heady brilliantly clear golden amber. The head is sticky and lasting. Aroma is Earthy, Butterscotch, Hops, and Booze. Flavor starts sweet immediately followed by booze that muddles into a caramel hop mixture. The hops taste earthy and dry. The hop bitterness is smooth and firm and it lingers on the tongue after the beer is well gone. This is a phenomenal ESB.","North Dakota, USA","GreatDane1632"

4333,"2014-03-02",4.4,"Bomber was gift from my wife. I like the wax dip, but HLF, it took two openers, a box knife and finally a lighter to get the cap off. Worth the work, though. Pretty, rich copper/burnt orange color with some mostly dissipating tan head. Superb lacing. Malty, boozy, somewhat metallic aroma. Taste is remarkably smooth and crisp. Slightly sweet with a clean finish. The price point dictates I wont get this often, but its a hell of a treat.","","Stevesie"
4333,"2014-01-18",3.4,"Bottle shared with friends. Pours a clear deep amber with a tan head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of earthy grains and earthy pine hops with a good amount of grass. Flavor has has more earthy grains with some grass and a good amount of hay.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
4333,"2014-01-03",4.6,"Poured from a bomber, lets talk about that first. Exceptional identity/design for the brewer, love the artwork. Im also a huge fan of naming a beer what it isDouble ESB. So already points for presentation. However, as much as I like dipped bottles, I have never had the trouble I have with these three bottles. Holy moly thats some secure, solid stuff. Once youre in though, you get a burnt orange pour with a thick, dissipating head that lingers at the end. I purposely spilt some on me to wear as a cologne, thats what I think of the aroma. Mouthfeel is very smooth and grown up. This tops my previous double ESB favorite, Tallgrasss Oasis. My only downer is the price, $13 a bomber blows my wallet to pieces. Its worth every penny, dont get me wrong, but it means I cant enjoy it nearly as often as I would like. To sum it up, easily one of my favorite tasting beers, easily my favorite identity, and the fact its a local brew just sends it over the edge. Well done, well done indeed.","Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA","gururyan"
