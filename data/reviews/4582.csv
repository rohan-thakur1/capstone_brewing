4582,"2017-04-18",3.2,"Slight haze, light tan. Not much head. Touch of gin, fruity and sweet citrus. Kind of candyish, so its not bad but it doesnt really come together in a meaningful way for me.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4582,"2017-04-04",2.7,"Draught at Alibi Room, VancouverHazy deep blond color. Some aroma of soap, lemon, cranberry. Sweetish flavor, carrots and other vegetables, soap, a bit astringent in the final.Very confused.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
4582,"2017-03-06",3.8,"On tap at CapTap. Pours dark gold with a thick off-white head and a citrus aroma. There is a hearty wheat malt flavor with a a lime finish and a nice touch of gin.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
4582,"2017-03-04",3.9,"Tap at Cap Tap. Pours translucent dark gold with a white head. For me the aroma is pale fruit with a hint of juniper. Med body or better. Flavor is weird lime with juniper. Frickin love gin. Cant drink the straight stuff, so gotta get it in beer stuff! This is so unwitt! It is so much like a ginger beer? No. But it really, really demonstrates gin. Yummy. Oh yes. Not getting the wood, but the gin/juniper is totally there for me. Imperializing the wit was a very good idea. Gives it substance. Sour? Not for me, unless kaffir lime counts. And I dont think it does. Clarence drowned in malmsey. Id take this instead.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
4582,"2016-07-24",3.7,"Shared bomber poured to plastic showing a hazed, orangey gold hue, with a fluffy layer of light cream colored head foam, and wavy cling to the lacing. The nose was artificial orange as Tang breakfast drink, some spice, and juniper berry. Light to medium bodied, with spritzy carbonation, the taste was citrusy, noted a touch of the lime, and was tart & crisp, with some dryness to the finish. Lively refreshment.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
4582,"2016-01-12",4.0,"Pours an almost clear golden with a high white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is of 7-Up (TM), herbs and gin. Taste is of juicy fruits, 7-Up again (the soft drink impressions are 
quite impressive), chinotto and various herbs. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate and there is a light gin kick in the finish. Overall a really nice drink, expertly crafted!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

4582,"2016-01-10",3.7,"Bottle (22 oz) shared at tasting. Thanks to Lurkaholic for the bottle! Slightly hazy bright golden with a medium white head, good retention, leaving little lacing. Aroma is of lemongrass and lime mostly, but also gin-like herbs, mild to moderate spiciness and juicy tropical fruits... weird but fun. Taste is also lemongrass forward and quite wheaty along herbal notes, mild berry presence and gentle tartness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Herbal and berries finish. Not too heavy for the abv. Quite flavorful and despite being strange its rather enjoyable.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

burnt orange color a nice resilient white foamy dense off-white head. 

The aroma is this juicy orange, jolly rancher and tropical fruit smell. Its an interesting smell. 

Good mouthfeel but quickly fades leaving a sweet malty wheat taste

has a similar fruit sweetness of the aroma but less candy flavorings. Oranges, kiwi, mango. Its a fruity wheat ale? I dont know the deScription but its interesting. long after swallowing, it has a flat cola similarity","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Flavor: Light, floral, juniper, lightly tart lemon, bitter juniper and light ginger finish. 
Comment: Lively carbonation, very subtle and complex. Hard to call it beer, but if one likes subtle floral flavors this is brilliant.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"

Starts with smooth wheat flavors with good earthy gin flavors. Finishes smooth but very sour with kaffir lime citrus and club soda flavors.
