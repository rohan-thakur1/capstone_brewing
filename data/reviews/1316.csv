1316,"2015-09-12",3.6,"Restrained aroma in a dark brown pour. Smokey peat balance with a full malt body and restrained finish.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
1316,"2014-01-31",4.0,"The head is ok, body brown. It smells oak aged, smoky, dry, fruity, like a really good scotch ale! The taste is smoked , peat, intensive, dry, aromatic, whisky, scotch, earthy, great!","Otorohanga, NEW ZEALAND","kiwianer"
1316,"2014-01-26",3.3,"Bottled. New Zealand holiday 2011-12. Old notes. The aroma has caramel, slight smoke, roast. Clear, dark brown coloured beer with an off-white head. The taste is sweet, roasted and a bit ashy on the tongue. Bit carbonated.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
1316,"2012-11-07",4.4,"Really superb beverage. Full of interesting, tasty malt flavours hightend by the alcohol. The smokiness is pleasant and not to over bearing, adding another tasty dimension.","NEW ZEALAND","Rangi"
1316,"2012-08-30",3.8,"Poured a lighter colour than I expected, and had some delicious peat / smoky flavours. A great cold weather beer.","AUSTRALIA","M_Jager"
1316,"2012-07-10",3.3,"Bottle - Murky brown. Monstrous head.  Medium carbonation. Medium to full bodied. Earthy. Pine. Smoky (way too much so) Very hoppy.  Medium bitterness. Interesting but not my idea of a scotch ale.","Tasmania, AUSTRALIA","Thylacine"
1316,"2012-02-15",4.0,"A darker, more bitter Rex Attitude?  Maybe, and may be better for it.  The darker Scottish ale suits the smokiness well, suiting a cool evening whiling away by the fire side.  Those who dislike strongly smoked ales wont like this either, but for those not adverse to a bit of peat, this is a good one.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","buzz_and_hum"
1316,"2012-02-03",3.9,"Interesting brew. Bartender says very limited availabiiity. Poured with a nice, thick, creamy, textured, cream colored head and lots of lace. Aroma is olives! Flavor is peat, malt, fairly dry, nice tang. Body and carbonation are great. Finish is like flavor, short, especially for the style, and very drinkable.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
1316,"2012-01-07",3.2,"Bottle. Pours a deep mahogany with lightish cream coloured head. Aromas are both sweet and smokey with some subtle spices. Nice. Flavours show more of the sweetness. Whilst there is some dark caramel / toffee there is also some overly sweet sugar. Unfrotunately the smoke and spiciness seems to disappear which means there is not much to balance the sweetness. Medium mouthfeel but a little too sweet for my liking.","AUSTRALIA","bluebetty"
1316,"2011-10-14",3.7,"tons of peat. Full on malt bomb, a touch of whisky, full bodied.
Dry warming. Very nice rich brew and good winter beer.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
1316,"2011-09-05",3.4,"Bottle from Mane Liquor. Red copper pour with a nice frothy, lasting white head. Lots of peat malt with an earthy, caramel malt in the background followed by some herbal notes. Lots of toasty bread notes throughout followed by herbs, smoke and ginger caramel. Nice touch. High carbonation. Solid and has a nice little reputation coming along","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
1316,"2011-09-03",3.6,"Clear reddy copper body with lasting off-white head. The peat malt tends to stand out  for me then some caramel in the aroma. Taste is the same, carbonation is good, a little smoke comes through, overall a good beer.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
1316,"2011-08-31",4.2,"330ml bottle. Big copper colour flecked with red and a layer of light tan foam. Full malty aroma that is rich and sweet with a hint of smoke. Creamy and smooth in the mouth with a wood smoke aftertaste that stays around. Long lasting flavour and I would happily wear a skurrt if it meant that I could drink this fine scotch ale.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"

1316,"2011-08-27",3.7,"I had heard of this beer by reputation before I tried it, which is usually a very good sign. Pours slightly lighter than a brown ale, but darker than a standard New Zealand Draught (ugh). Big cream coloured head and aromas of caramel, herbs and un-cut grass. Flavours veer more toward the caramel initially and then the other flavours run smoothly into toasty bready characters, roast stuffing (sage and thyme). I love those herbs and Im really enjoying this beer. Its toothsome and filling and not shy of flavour. Id love this in a pint. Only toward the finish does the smoke start to rise, but not in an Islay whisky way. More a Highland Park whisky way.
If anyone from the brewery reads this, well done lads.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
1316,"2011-08-26",3.4,"Pours dark brown with a large, lasting head.
Nose is quite floral and hoppy, light fruit and piny resin show along with some earthy characters... Not exactly too style hey? Underneath is lots of caramel with very soft peat and golden syrup.
Same story with the flavours, seems more like an IPA than a scotch ale! Lots of caramel and resinous pine. Some heavier, richer malt shows later along with some warming alcohol and bold bitterness.
Carbonation is much too high.
Im really confused, this is just so incredibly hoppy for the style...","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
1316,"2011-08-15",3.1,"Bottle, 9C. Clear copper with an inch of off-white head. Aroma of toffee, medium sherry, some spices, a little smoke. Tastes sweet with singed toffee, some nuts. Decent bitterness with spices, sherry and smoke at the end. Finish too soon overwhelms what should be the main show.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
