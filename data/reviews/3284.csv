Orangée, col épais et crémeux blanc.
Arôme au bouquet barrique généreux, fruité avec ce rappel de raisin fermenté, fleurs de houblon avec un côté noble. Je note peu cet ajout de grenade.
Palais est fruité avec un bon ajout de grenade tout en ayant ce profil belge notamment au niveau levure tirant ici vers une triple.
Fini un suret avec une brève amertume citronnée et houblonnée. Le côté vin blanc nest pas en reste et vient balancer parfaitement la bière. Effervescence correcte ponctuée par ces rappels de vin blanc et léger boisé.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
