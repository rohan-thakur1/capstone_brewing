2744,"2015-10-13",3.1,"Orange body, clear, some lacing. Malty, then a touch of bitterness. Nice, fairly hoppy lager. Definitely good quality and among the best pale lagers Ive had. They all should be like this.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
2744,"2015-10-06",3.0,"12 oz. can, consumed on 10-4-15. Pours a highly effervescent, pale gold with a large amount of cream to light beige head. Produces pretty good lacing. Looks better than a typical pale lager but not special. Lightly floral, slightly dry aroma. Honey, fruity taste with a dry finish. A bit of bitter spiciness. Just a bit of beeriness. Simple but not at all bad flavor. Lively and soft in the palate. Not as crisp as ideal. Overall, good, refreshing, reasonably aromatic and tasty beer for the style, but I cant say its a particularly impressive craft beer overall. I know the brewery calls this a ""Pale Lager"" but it really should be classified as a Premium Lager.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
2744,"2015-09-28",2.9,"on tap at a bar in MSP, pretty clear pale body. Pretty dry taste, not a very good beer. Would not drink again","The World of Beer, Texas, USA","Haslinger"
2744,"2015-09-28",3.2,"12 oz. can from TheHOFF43- thanks again, Hoff! Pours a clear gold with an orange hue and a small off-white head that laces the glass. Notes of pale and bready and crackery malts, straw, apple, grass, and earth. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a clean, malty mouthfeel. Excellent example of the style. Impressive.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2744,"2015-09-24",2.9,"Sampled at gabf. Clear golden. Not a lot of nose. Mdecent bitterness is citrus. Fruit is fairly big. Dryness.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
2744,"2015-09-21",2.2,"Can. Pours a clear pale gold body with a one finger frothy white head that left some sticky lace. The nose is fairly clean, some crackery malt with lesser notes of corn and minimal hops. The flavor is pretty poor, lots and lots of corn coming thru, not enough malt flavor. Almost devoid of hops as well, save for a bit on the late finish. Light bodied and fizzy with a clingy finish. Not so good this one. I really wonder why a brewery as good as Indeed would want to make a beer that tastes like this.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2744,"2015-08-20",3.6,"Can from Santa. Clear golden pour with a frothy white head. Aroma was grassy hops, cereal grain, sweet corn. Flavors were grassy, grainy and earthy with a touch of sweet corn.

2744,"2015-08-13",3.6,"12oz can shared. Poured a bright clear yellow with a white head. The aroma is a pleasant medium malt with a hint of spice and hops on the end. The flavor is medium malt and a spicy hop finish crisp and clean and probably one of the better pale lagers out there. Very nice mouth feel.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
2744,"2015-08-08",3.6,"Can. Gold color with a medium head. Aroma is generally floral, but a bit of orange marmalade. A bit boozy. Light hits of grain and bitterness. Earthy, dusty, floral hop flavor. Very full bodied. Dry finish.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

2744,"2015-07-30",4.0,"Rating it for its style of Pale Lager and its one of the better ones Ive had. Clean, very light hop, easy to drink, no off flavors or aftertastes, what a good pale lager should be.","Minneapolis, ","Obfuscate"
2744,"2015-07-22",3.7,"Lovely hazed gold appearance; an ever-present thin layer of foam and even lacing. White peach, mandarin orange and soft herbs lead the aroma. Honeycomb and cereal malts, some musty lager yeast follow, becoming more prominent with breathing room. Bitter, herbal flavor showing white sage, dry grass, lemon zest and more minor suggestions of stone fruits; this has more commonality with a reimagined, hoppy Pilsner style than a pale lager to me. Furthermore, while the body is crisp, the higher alcohol components and hefty bitterness detract from the possibility of uninhibited, carefree refreshment here; this lager demands attention. The finish is semi-dry, again herbal and grassy. Interesting stuff. Alcohol does seem too present for me, and some of the other details could be a little disorganized, but in general this is really nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
2744,"2015-07-12",3.9,"(can) Pours clear gold with a large white head and some sparse lacing. Aroma is certainly big on the mandarina bavaria as there is a boatload of tangerine up in here. Clementine if you wish, with a shade of canned lychee fruit. A smidge of vanilla? Not understanding the previous ratings which are stating this is a ""typical"" pale lager, as these are scents I rarely encounter in lager world, and what Im smelling here is damn fine. Theres a little undertone of characteristic lager must that attempts to emerge on the nose, but its quickly tamped down by tangerine. Flavor continues the tangerine display with a bunch on the front end which carries on through towards the finish. Theres a little hit of maltiness here in the mid, but the hops are carrying much of the flavor weight. Theres a little kick of spice in the far finish which cleans up the tangerine and gives a crispness to the beer. Mouthfeel is medium (fuller than most pale lagers) and carb is dialed in. Works for me.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

2744,"2015-04-17",3.7,"Gold color of the white lacing head. Aroma has lots of noble hops. good noble hop flavor. I will probably call this a pilsner even if not not exactly to Pilsner style. Dry hop flavor very dry finish great beer.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
