Its a bit thin in the middle, but Ill attribute that to the lower abv of comparable beers and results ina more drinkable OS.

608,"2017-02-21",4.0,"This beer made my mid-afternoon. 2013 vintage at Rose & Crown in Palo Alto. Appearance was dark chocolate with a minimal light tan head. Aroma was strong coffee, chcolate, roasty grains with a hint of cream. 

Taste was incredibly well-balanced, with the immediate bitter sweetness of chocolate, backed by toasted grains and a little sprinkling of char. Subtle hints of dark fruit, but not too sweet - any sweetness came from an almost chocolate milk type flavor. Maybe even a little vanilla. Its the subtleties that make this beer - yes its a big bold stout, but very highly refined. Mothfeels is - dare I say - velvety? Not too think, but soft carbonation keeps it supple.

608,"2016-12-03",3.9,"Ok, stop laughing, clowns. To set the record straight, I have ticked this many times. The first time was in the first dark age, before I discovered legit beer ticking (pre-2008). The second and other subsequent times were in the second dark age of 2012-15 when I was ticking beers but not rating them on here, a disgraceful era Id rather not talk about. If you want to learn more, Shia LaBeouf plays me in ""Tickiana Jones and The Legend of the Lost Ticks"" (yes, he did win the Best On-Screen Ticking Performance an Oscar for it). Well here I am, merking the Merkin once more, but this time, legitimately recording the moment. Boxed bomber poured into a Lost Abbey glass (not a comment on the carbonation; this has some carbonation, a.k.a. infinitely more than most vintages of Angels Share). The beer pours darkest brown with a thin tan head that fades to a ring. Now I have put my nose into many merkins in my day, most with a quite foul odor, but this was much more pleasant. Nice bourbon and oak notes, balanced by dark chocolate, light roast, caramel, and molasses. The flavor has a touch of chocolate/caramel sweetness that yields to a dry finish with some bourbony heat. The feel is quite light with soft carbonation, a little hot. So there it is. You happy now?","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Poured a black color with 2-to-3 fingers of rocky, tan head. Above average amount of spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled a big whiff of boozy bourbon up front, followed by toffee, caramel, milk chocolate, light espresso, oaky vanilla, oatmeal, faint dates and even some maple syrup. (Smell - 4.25)

Taste was pretty good, but nowhere as flavorful as I thought it would be. Especially after having another BCBS earlier in the day. Got smooth bourbon, chocolate, faint crayon, toffee, caramel, light oaky vanilla, tobacco, dry oatmeal, faint roasty malts and faint rye bread. Seemed to be missing something. Disappointing. (Taste - 3.75) 

Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.50)

I was expecting so much more in this one. Good, but nowhere near their anniversary beers, Sucaba, Parabola, etc. I probably overrated it a tad. (Overall - 4.000

608,"2014-10-03",3.9,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a nearly pitch black color with a thick and creamy tan colored head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading and leaving behind a sticky looking lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma is big of a sweet oatmeal smell with a good showing of a woody and bourbon boozy smell. Along with these aromas comes smells of caramel and vanilla as well as a little bit of a more toasted malt and somewhat grainy smell giving a very nice warningly dark and sweet smell
 Taste- The taste begins with a big sweet oatmeal flavor with a good and heavy flavor of oats and caramel as well as a bit of vanilla and some nice woody and bourbon flavors upfront. There is a decent showing of a more roasted and chocolate flavor upfront, but these pale in comparison to the sweeter oat. As the taste advances the woody flavors lessen a bit, but the sweeter flavors grow even more intense with quite a bit more vanilla and caramel coming to the tongue. All the while the more roasted flavors really start picking up steam more toward the end surpassing the oat flavor of the brew. While at 8.5 % abv., the alcohol is very well concealed and with the mix of flavors that is left at the end, a nice roasted and sweet, lightly woody and moderately oatmeal like flavor is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel-The body of the beer is on the thinner side for a oatmeal stout of 8.5% abv with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side. A thicker body and lower carbonation would have been much better for the oatmeal and sweeter roasted flavors of the brew, really giving support to these rich flavors.

 Overall- A rather tasty oatmeal stout overall with a nice hit of woody bourbon flavor without a whole lot of heavy and hot booziness. A nice, oatmeal, semi-sweet roasty brew.","","Darkmagus82"

608,"2014-02-17",4.6,"Reviewed from notes. Poured into a snifter and a pint glass.
The appearance is a jet black colored body with a head that seems to last just a tad longer in the snifter and concaves a bit than the pint glass. Its about a half finger off-white sort of tan that dies at a very nice pace with more spotty lacing is in the pint glass than the snifter.
The smell is the same amount of bourbon in both glasses, smokey chocolate comes through, slightly roasty and oaty.
The taste is sweet roasty bourbon-ness with a slight smokey-esque feel strolling around my taste buds with some vanilla making a decent presence. There is a bourbon sweet aftertaste with a sticky yet somewhat dry chocolate bourbon finish (wow, what a complex finish, I dont think Ive ever had any finish like that before).
On the palate, for an oatmeal stout at 8.5 that was bottled in August of this year, wow, this lives up to its name - what a ""velvety"" smooth feel rolling around my tongue and mouth, the more I sip the more I think holey moley wow, this feels great around my mouth especially with the lack of age on it; Id say its about a medium in body, more of a sipper for sessionabilitys sake. Carbonation is pretty good for the style and for me, not much pounding the mouth and tongue but thats ok.
Overall, this could quite possibly be the best oatmeal stout that Ive ever had. I didnt know it was going to be this good.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Overall: This beer is pretty wonderful. I am going to do something that may not be fair, but hopefully you will find useful. Ill compare this beer to Parabola and Velvet Merlin. Compared to Parabola, Merkin seems less sweet and with less body. While both have heavy bourbon presence, I get more tannins with Merkin. At this point in my journey, I appreciate Parabola a tad more. Compared to Velvet Merlin, its far more complex, obviously stronger.

Followed by a punch of strong whiskey and long lasting oaky vanilla. The lasting finish is the real highlight of this beer. Palate is velvety smooth up front and while not a super thick beer, I see no reason to complain about thin body here. Plenty of body, especially for the ABV, and medium carbonation.

608,"2013-12-15",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2014 2013 release, date is smudged.
Appearance: The beer pours a deep brown to black and appears pitch black in the body. The head is short and dense, settling into a big foamy ring with a light coating.
Aroma: The aroma is phenomenal, complex and inviting. The aroma has a prominent brownie batter aroma with earthy roasted coffee matching it in strength perfectly, hints of barrel back this up providing a touch of coconut and vanilla. The aroma reminds me a bit of an Oreo cookie at times, brownie batter at others and chocolate covered espresso beans. The aroma leans sweet but not cloying.
Taste: The intro is light of roasted coffee and brownie batter that lays a mild base for the beer. Toasted coconut and sweet vanilla compliment this nicely by the finish, vanilla being rather prominent. The finish lingers and hangs on my tongue and in the back of my throat like oaky bourbon. I love the balance throughout and how restrained the flavor is. Nothing is overly bold, all of the flavors simply blend together harmoniously to give a semi-dry and complex beer.
Palate: Full-bodied, but a bit thin at times, velvety texture and mild carbonation.
Overall: This is a fantastic beer when all is said and done. This may be my second favorite Firestone Walker beer, after Parabola. The only way I could enjoy this more is if the malt base were a bit bigger and the chocolate and coffee flavors were just a bit more bold. Well done.

2014 Release.
Glass: Firestone Walker Reserve glass.
Appearance: Deep opaque chestnut, appearing black without some huge backlight. The pale tan head is short lived and rests into a light coating.
Aroma: Tobacco and cherry comes to mind instantly with a dash of brownie batter, smoke and roasted malts. Complex and very enjoyable aroma, I wish it were stronger.
Taste: Bold with some bitterness up front. Tobacco and brownie batter are big, with mild bourbon by the end of the mid-taste and a finish of smoke and roasted malts. A bit thin though and a bit watery at times. Lingering bourbon and coconut milk.
Palate: Oily slightly thick body with mild carbonation.
Overall: Not as impressed as I was last year, which is odd since Firestone seems most impressed with this version. Still a good beer, but I dont know if Id say its worth it this year.

Flavor is also fairly oat forward and sweet with a moderate chocolate note and lighter caramel and toffee. Bourbon and oak are light but vanilla is moderate. Medium light bitterness and no hop flavor.
Mouthfeel is medium to medium light bodied with moderate carbonation; its honestly thinner than I expected. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.
Overall a good stout, but I was left expecting a bit more mouthfeel. The oat quality and vanilla from the barrels is very apparent, but the bourbon character is a little light for my tastes. This is not a beer I would cellar as I feel its at its peak.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

608,"2013-10-06",4.0,"so, this goes in the right direction. I got the last bottle tonight and watched Caddyshack (a good pairing). Now, the nose goes to the sweet heavy alch alley, and the light brown tea reading clouds lace the pond of translucent black. The mouthfeel is light for this type of beer, so swishing it in my mouth was helpful. But being in the Bourbon-barrel aged catagory, it leaves me a bit underwhelemed in the company of KBS and BCBS, and Boris the Crusher. But I was able to get throught the bottle without zonking out.","California, USA","popway"

Very mellow, extremely easy-drinking, and so incredibly decadent. So fucking good.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
608,"2013-10-04",3.8,"Bottle. Pours deep brown, nearly black with thick, creamy tan head of nice duration, splotchy lacing. Aroma is big on the chocolate, vanilla, and oak. Throw in some firestone walker je ne sais quoi, and you have an inviting beer. Taste is moderately sweet, with milk chocolate, more vanilla, and a pleasant roasty, almost charred finish. Caramel and toffee as well. Texture is thin on this, which is a shame. I understand its not an imperial stout, but it otherwise presents itself as one. Anyway, medium body, thin, slick texture, soft carbonation, dry finish leaves me feeling almost parched. Plenty of bourbon / alcohol present in all phases as well. Overall: this is very nice, but mouthfeel is its weak point. FW is perhaps victim to its own success in this regard, as the proprietor barrel-aged and boxed series is the height of richness and intensity, leading, perhaps, to unrealistic subconscious expectations.

Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a one finger light beige head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic streaks of lace left behind. 

Boozy bourbon barrel aroma thats nicely integrated into the base beer(which is partially bourbon BA). I thought amping it up to 100% BA might kill off some of those notes but theyre still there underneath the barrel presence. Strong spicy bourbon, earthy oak, vanilla and coconut followed by roasted dark malt, chocolate, robust coffee and oatmeal. 

Medium bodied but a bit thinner than I expected with a strong bourbon barrel presence thats excellently integrated into the flavor of the regular Merlin version. Sweet and spicy bourbon dominated up front with some boozy heat but it never becomes to hot. Feels stronger than 8.6 but not harsh. Theres also some dry oak, toasted coconut and vanilla followed by roasted dark malt, silky chocolate, caramel, toffee and oatmeal. Subtle dry bitterness but never approaches burnt or acrid.

608,"2011-12-13",3.7,"Sampled on Tap at 1702, Tucson; March 2010
Arrives from the tap an opaque, dark color that shows a touch of clear red / brown hues when held up to the light. The head is quite wispy and seems a bit dark.  At first the aroma has a thin vanilla note to it as well as a roast grain aromatic.  Actually the aroma is really hard for me to smell, but as it warms I get hints of buttery oak and a hint of almost fruity tartness.
 
There is a hint of sweetness in the flavor (or is that vanillin) up front, but this dries out quite significantly as this rolls across the tongue. Vanillin lingers along with notes of dark chocolate, roasted grain and a hint of barrel-derived spiciness on the palate.  The mouthfeel is pretty creamy feeling, but it still remains light as this is definitely a beer to quaff a couple pints of.  The roast character dominates the flavor profile, but it is well balanced and keeps from being harsh, astringent, or acidic (which I find as common ""flaws"" in roasted beers).  This is really well balanced in the flavor; roast, sweeter malt character, vanillin and bittering notes all work together quite harmoniously.  The barrel is quite mellow actually, vanillin is here, as is an oak derived spiciness and a tannic quality in the finish, but I could almost be convinced that this was not barrel aged.
 
This is an awesome quaffing / session brew; it is full flavored, delicious and complex, too bad that this aroma comes off as being so muted (is it the glass, my nose, I dont know but I think it is actually just the beer).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

608,"2011-10-16",4.0,"Tasted alongside Parabola.  Opaque, fairly oakey, some applewood smoke?, well carbonated, less rich and less dried dark fruit and chocolate than Parabola.  Would very happily drink again, but prefer Parabola.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
608,"2011-10-13",3.6,"Sampled at Deconstructed event during LA Beer Week, very interesting beer.  Has the oaky and bourbony thing going on but it is also very dry.  I liked this one as much as the regular Velvet.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
608,"2011-10-08",4.0,"On tap, poured thick black with nice creamy tan head, aroma brought notes of lots of chocolate, toffee, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, some oats and burnt toast, and roast in there as well.  Really nice smelling, and the taste was the same and still smooth.  Big creamy chocolate, roast, coffee and toffee mixed with the slight vanilla and bourbon notes, finishing slightly bitter, nice and creamy on the palate.  Very good!","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"

Pours a dark brown color with a thin tan head and a few spots of lacing.  Nice collar as it goes down.  The nose brings a good contingent of roast and chocolate alongside the really nice barrel notes.  Fantastic amount of bourbon plus some oak and vanilla.  The flavor brings smooth bourbon as well as oak, vanilla, chocolate, and moderate roast.  Medium body that is quite creamy with really nice barrel qualities.  Very, very well done.  Not surprising coming from Firestone.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
608,"2011-05-22",4.6,"On tap. Oatmeal stout aged in bourbon for a year. Pour is black tinted brown, spotty thin lacing, no head. Aromas of smoke, oats, toffee, juicy west coast hops. Taste is very floral for an oatmeal stout with just the right amount of roast. Taste is tons of chocolate and resinous hops. Finishes smooth as hell. So drinkable especially at 5.5%. Another awesome brew from David Walker.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
608,"2011-02-02",3.6,"On tap. Pours dark brown with a thin beige head and a chocolate and coffee aroma. There is a dry chocolate and cola flavor with a bourbon finish. Very tasty.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
608,"2011-01-23",3.9,"Just caught on about Merkin - note said Merkin: Draft at WCBF 08. Keg driven up the valley. Good show. Dark malt and chocolate aromas. Black color with a tan head. Fresh dark malt - smooth - with bourbon & oak notes. Quite a bit of bourbon. Finish is quite smooth. Just super excellent. When they ran out, and I really wanted more, they gave me the glassful that was on display. Over a hundred in the shade, but that beer which had stood out for several hours was still damn good.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
608,"2010-12-21",3.9,"Tap at Blind Lady.  Didnt quite notice this was a different version, until I bummed into someone who recognized me from when I used to frequent Lost Abbey.  This was definitely a smoother version than the original.  Bourbon really nicely blends on this one.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
608,"2010-11-10",3.6,"Pours opaque with a hint of brown. A tan head does not last too long.  Aromas of mostly chocolate and lots of coffee on the late nose. Viscous coating on the mouthfeel. Chocolate, coffee and vanilla dominate the palate. The bourbon barrel really mellows/balances this out, but doesnt impart much flavor. Some cola on the finish.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
608,"2010-11-08",3.9,"On draft at Firestone 14th party. Poured a dark black color with tan head. Mild roast and hint of oak in the aroma. Taste was very smooth and mild roast with hints of bourbon and a velvety texture. Very good and not overwhelming with the bourbon but not as roasty as regular.","Lake Arrowhead, California, USA","JoeTheYounger"
608,"2010-11-07",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 18, 2013 Draft at the Firestone 14 Release Party. Pure BA Merlin not the 20% BA blend. Nose is prominent bourbon with lots of chocolate and oaky vanilla.Pitch black with a small tan head. Flavor is a nice amount of bourbon, oak woodiness, and dark chocolate. The coffee I had noticed heavily in the regular blend was missing replaced with a nice dark chocolate flavor. 11/7/2010 9/4/9/4/18 4.4

Bomber from Country Club Liquors. Nose is oaky vanilla, light bourbon, chocolate, and a sweet candisugar note. Very dark clear brown with a medium tan head. Flavor is a silky smooth chocolate tinged with vanilla and slight bourbon. With the lower ABV it has no heat.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
