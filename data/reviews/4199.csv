4199,"2016-12-05",3.7,"Lost a Dunkler Bock today luckily this was on tap nearby so slip to 14 only temporary. Fine dark Amber pour beige foamy head. Nose is light spice and malt. Tastes of caramel, honey, malt, earth light subdued spice. Medium carbonated. Finish is brief. Decent.","New York, USA","Jow"
4199,"2015-12-29",4.2,"12 oz. pour at Holy Grale. Aroma: Reminds me very much of my wifes molasses ginger Christmas cookies... rich, spiced dark bready notes that you expect from this kind of beer. Appearance: Garnet red-brown body with beautiful clarity; the gentle carbonation holds up a firm tan cap. Flavor: Very much like the nose- spiced christmas cookie goodness most of the way through, finally giving way to a dry, lightly bitter finish. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, abrupt finish. Overall: Really hits the spot for those with a bockbier craving this time of year- unseasonably warm weather be damned.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

4199,"2015-02-18",4.4,"Poured into a tall snifter. Pours a dark clear amber-brown with a small head with fine bubbles and a little bit of lacing, color is off white/cream colored. 

Aroma: Lots of sweet malt, brown sugar, dark dried fruit, and some roasted malt. The aroma is very inviting and smells sweet and robust. 

Taste: Malt, some sweetness, little bit of dried fruit, and a mild lingering bitterness that is very pleasant. The hops come in at the end, very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied lighter feeling that it looks with a little chewiness. Finish is medium long and enjoyable. 

I enjoy German Beers a lot and this one is no exception, I stumbled across this randomly and wish there were more bottles at the time because Id like to try this several times. Definitely full of German character this is a great beer for the winter season and really allows you enough complexity to enjoy it without being too intense. Would drink again. Btw, its 5.1% abv instead of the listed 7.1","USA","Trmx2"
4199,"2015-02-03",3.4,"Awesome nutty and malty aromas. Sweet almost toffee like. Light brown color with little head retention. Biscuity flavor with some dried fruits. Very smooth.","Florida, USA","Weezel"
4199,"2015-01-19",3.3,"Bottle 50cl - Pours a slightly hazy light brown/orange with a smallish head. Caramel and heavy malt aromas. Rich caramel taste with some sweetness followed by a slightly bitter finish. I like it.","MOROCCO","bkurtz"
4199,"2015-01-11",2.8,"Total Wine, Delaware 50cl: Pours copper with a tan head. Aroma is fruits and malts. Taste is sweet then finishes in a mediocre malty note. This beer was not very impressive. I am legitimately surprised by its high rating. It isnt hard to drink, but this is just not very good.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
4199,"2015-01-02",3.5,"500 ml bottle from Edelwiess. Pours a clear dark copper color with a medium white head. A sweet sugary nose with straw and banana. The flavor is medium sweetness, toffee, leaves, a bit of burnt caramel. This bottle tastes old with some oxidation showing, but there is no date to confirm. Overall, a dry white wine finish. Solid.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
4199,"2015-01-01",3.6,"Gravity pin at Proletariat in NYC. Flattish pour, brown beer. Lots of sweet woodsy malts. I like the slightly sweet, toasted, and light caramel touches. All brought down with an earthy character. The sweetness comes through near the end of the flavor.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
4199,"2014-12-25",3.3,"Poured from a pint-sized bottle into a pint glass to drink on Christmas. The beer had a hazy deep amber to light brown with a small foamy off-white head that had short retention, and light cling and lacing. Its aroma featured figs, raisins, and barley, along with cereal notes and bits of yeast, wheat, and floral tones. The beer had a somewhat sour grainy flavor with a bit of cereal and a subtle sweet malt barley effect as well. A fairly wet and watery beer with low carbonation and a light, fluid presence in the mouth. Thank you Siobhan for the Christmas present!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"
4199,"2014-12-15",3.2,"Bottle. Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, caramel), lightly hoppy (flowers), with notes of honey and tangerine. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively/soft carbonation.

Kinda syrupy sweet in the mouth makes it less drinkable than desired, but the nose is quite pleasant...enticing melanoidins and soft floral hops leave their distinct German thumbprint all over it. Doesnt seem like a 7.1% brew, though...thought it was mislabeled at first, in fact, due to the confusion with the Monks Christmas / Bonifatius Dunkel.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4199,"2014-02-03",3.5,"Bottle, labeled Monks Christkindl @ 7.1% ABV. Pours a slightly hazy dark copper with a 1 finger, soapy, off white head. Aroma is big on cereal, caramel, toast, crusty white bread, honey, granola and spicy, herbal hops. Flavor is full of toasty, nutty and caramel notes up front, then some toffee, hay, granola, lots of cereal, dry grass, spicy, herbal and floral hops. the finish offers an interesting honey and cooked tree fruit taste. Medium body, creamy to chewy feel, light, but blanketing carbonation and fairly neutral finish. Good stuff overall, a bit sweeter than I would like.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
4199,"2013-12-30",3.6,"Drank as Weißenoher Monks Christkindl Dunkel (aliased beer name) on cask. No aroma detected from the dark brown pour with a frothy cask head that holds well. Taste is malty with a slight funk and subtle chocolate notes. Christkindl is a tasty and easy drinking dark beer for the Winter season.","Orlando, Florida, USA","sloshgator"
4199,"2013-03-25",3.7,"500 ml bottle from BevMo in Mira Mesa, CA.   This rating is for the ""Monks Christkindl Special Winter Brew"" beer which Im not sure is the same as this listing, but thats what its tagged to.   Sweet caramel and candied fruit aromas from a crystal clear copper/amber body with a medium light tan head.    The sweet aromas carry straight through to the taste where that delicious German lager taste is waiting.   Theres a rich nutty flavor that dries out the sweetness and balances it very well.   A bit of woody bitterness and what seems like a bit of a bite from alcohol, but its only 5.1% ABV, so Im not sure where thats coming from.   Ends with a dry but still sweet finish.   Deliciously rich and tasty German dark lager.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
4199,"2012-12-16",3.6,"Bottle @ home titled ""Weißenoher Monks Christkindl"" picked up at Argonaut Denver. Pours a fairly clear, dark rust orange appearance with a cream colored head. Kind of spicy, tangerine, citrus fruity aroma with some straw, floral, and roasty notes. Lightly metallic/minearlic, herbal/earthy hoppy, caramel, somewhat nutty, fairly chewy flavor. Reminds me of my travels to Bavaria. Pretty tasty.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
