1740,"2006-12-22",3.4,"Draught. Copper-red with a creamy/soapy white head. Enticing aroma of toasted caramel and orange citrus. Just the interplay is quite enticing and well thought out.  Creamy to start and some cookie-type flavours contribute a nice sharp feel. Toasty malts and faint European hop character also show their face. Solid balance.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
