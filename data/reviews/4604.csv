4604,"2017-02-27",3.5,"Appearance: translucent dirty pale gold with two fingers of fizzy white head diminishing rapidly to a persistent thick creamy cap, patchy lacing. (3/5) Aroma: doughy yeast, orange peel, banana, coriander/clove, hint of floral. (7/10) Taste: moderate sweet, mild bitter. (7/10) Palate: Medium-light slightly slick body, lively to moderate carbonation, off-dry mildly bitter and spicy warming finish. (4/5)

Im pretty sure this is the first time Ive ever had a double white, and its not your typical Belgian, thats for sure. Initially, the aroma is dominated by a bready, doughy yeast completely unlike anything Ive encountered in a Belgian before. (Though quite similar to e.g. Council Brewings house yeast, which Im sure is 100% Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or bakers yeast.) That doughy aroma settles back along with the initially large and fizzy white head, allowing the more traditional Witbier aromas to come through. The higher alcohol seems to come through in the middle and finish, presenting as - well, its not fair to say solvent-like, since that implies a harshness thats not present - but certainly a sweet slick warmth not present in a typical Witbier. For the second glass, I swirled in the lees, and both the curaçao orange peel and coriander spiciness amped up considerably. Not without its charms, but fairly middle of the pack both for Witbiers and for Belgian beers in general. (14/20)","CANADA","UXO"

The former (foam): citrus / lemon zest, vinegar, quite astringent (hint of chlorine even). Very interesting. Taste resembles white wine.

4604,"2010-09-05",4.0,".25L pour - $6.00 at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur, Georgia.

Appearance: Presents a very clouded, yellow-hued body underneath an inch of creamy, lasting, whitish froth.

Smell: Pleasant, aromatic melange of soft malts, citrus accents of lemon and orange, dried herbs, light honey, and peppery fresh coriander.

Taste: Lightly bready, lightly grainy impression from the barley, wheat, oats, and buckwheat of the grain bill. Kiss of sweet-tasting honey candy. Traces of subtle lemon juice preceding the bolder curaçoa. Big boost of spicy coriander and dried bitter orange peelings. Minor acidity. Hint of herbal hops, though very, very little bitterness, leaving the added spices to do the job of countering the sweetness. Finishes dry, continually spicy, and quite crisp.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-high carbonation. 

Drinkability: Definitely bigger than your garden variety witbier, but, with luck, the imperialization of the brew didnt turn this one ganky and unpleasant to drink. On the contrary, it was satiating and went down rather easily.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

4604,"2010-08-01",3.6,"a very crisp, belgian wheat ale, not so much the double version because of the abv, but because of the very tight almost champagne-like bubbles that dissipate very quickly. an enjoyable blend of the spices and oats, the only distasteful part is that the brewers yeast is brown and when poured into the glass, looks like you just poured brown sugar into your beer. After this ""white"" journey I have been on for the last year or so, and trying many different versions the one thing that is absolutely clear to me is that there are two distinct types of belgian wheat ales, the true witbier, and the belgian wheat ale, one having the traditional spice and coriandor, possibly a little orange in the flavor, made popular in the US by Allagash white. The other, which seems to be the more common wheat ale style, usually found flitered, a more crisp palate and without the ""fat"" taste of a witbier, this styles best example made by St. Bernardus.","Cloneen, IRELAND","beerfest5"

The nose is the usual spicy-sweet mix of citrus, coriander and hops.  At 7.5% ABV this is a strong wit but the alcohol is not obvious.  The mouth feel is somewhat creamier and oilier than a typical wit but not heavy.  This is a very nice, if slightly atypical, expression of the style.  It loses a great deal of its character at lower temps.  I recommend that you let it warm up to around 50F if served too cold.","Maine, USA","ShaneMacGowan"

A little fresh flowers here and there (dandelions mainly).  Doughy yeast.  Some grassy hops would have been very welcomed and could have actually made quite a difference.

4604,"2007-10-17",2.5,"My Bottom Line:
This frail and fizzy Witbier offers subtle orange zest and vague tropical fruitiness atop a dusty and doughy yeast tranquility. You can find much more flavorful and satisfying wheat beers with a lot less alcohol than this one.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slim ring of foam crowns the golden white haze.
-The flavor profile is rather watery for this beers purported size.
-This doesnt feel like a stronger version of a witbier at all.
-The aroma is substanceless and the flavor profile harmless, but without interest.
-This remains very drinkable, especially after having let it breathe for 30 minutes or so.

4604,"2007-10-13",3.6,"This caught my eye in Shoreline today as I was looking for something different. It poured to a light gold and straw body with a small head that effused a light aroma of fruits. I liked the malty character as the spices came through. There was something missing in it for me, though I liked the yeasty end.","Jacksonville, Florida, USA","bonbright7"
4604,"2007-10-01",3.9,"29-Apr-07 (750 ml corked and caged bottle, Bottled on 11-Mar-06: $11.79 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA)  The beer pours like sparkling wine, a voluminous, fluffy, white head that quickly recedes to a thin layer, leaving only a few small spots of foam on the glass.  Golden in color, the body is hazy, but not cloudy, with the densely packed sediment remaining in the bottle.  Citrusy, grassy and slightly sweet, the nose is initially reminiscent of Sauvignon Blanc, but aromas of funk and yeast soon join in, dispelling the perception of white wine.  And as the beer warms, a slightly bready graininess develops, adding complexity.  Because of the higher ABV, its not unreasonable to think this Dubbel Wit might be sweeter than the stylistically correct, lower ABV examples (probably because the amped-up witbiers produced in the USA often are sweeter), but this is definitely not the case here.  Yes, there is more of a suggestion of sweetness here, but its far, far in the background, easily superceded by the prominent citrusy tartness.  I wont call this a sour beer, per se, but the beer is certainly trending in that general direction.  Curaçao gives the beer an orange citrus, even a lemony quality that emphasizes tartness and gentle bitterness rather than sweet orange flavor.  Based on the perceived flavors, the added candi sugar hasnt been carmelized and has fully fermented, so its only apparent contribution is a boost to the ABV.  Coriander is perfectly integrated and isnt a prominent flavor.  Very dusty and cobwebby quality works well with the yeasty notes and significantly adds to the generally dry mouthfeel.  On the palate, this highly carbonated and wonderfully refreshing beer is medium in body, but seems much lighter due to the considerable tartness and carbonation.  Its quite expansive in the mouth and fairly bloating in the stomach as well, so boisterous eructations are unavoidable.  Overall, this is one of the most tart Belgian Whites Ive run across, and this along with the elevated ABV places this beer beyond the styles range, but the end result is fabulous.  The combination of lemon, orange, funk, yeast and dust make for a truly memorable drinking experience.  Highly recommended, despite the wallet-thinning price tag.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

4604,"2006-06-17",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2006 Explosively carbonated; I am only able to get two-fingers of beer into my tulip glass, the rest is foam.  The head is a voluminous pale white color and the beer is a hazy, full straw gold color.  The aroma is quite suitable for a Wit; notes of citrus, an earthy spiciness (from the coriander), a dry peppery note that is partway between ginger and grains of paradise.  Overall the aroma is dry, a bit tart, and definitely spicy.

The taste is lightly tart with a spritzy lemon character.  The finish has a certain tannic note to it that is lightly mouth puckering, perhaps there is a bit of chalkiness here as well.  Quite dry, and quite light on the palate, this could almost pass for a normal Wit.  Except for the bit of a bite of alcohol in the finish, and a soft creaminess that the body starts to pick up as the beer warms up.  The dominant flavor in this beer is of lemon peel, though it is only lightly tart.  Spicy notes of ginger, earthy and even lightly vegetal coriander notes, and a definite herbal note that seems to be a mix of mint, chamomile, perhaps some basil and even a note of licorice as the beer warms up.  This is definitely a tasty beer, it remains quite drinkable just like a normal Wit, but with an extra kick of alcohol.  It could be a bit richer though, more towards the double side of things, but it is actually quite in line with other Double Wits that I have had.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4604,"2006-05-16",4.0,"Hazy pale yellow. Franziskaner artist santa weizen glass. A slow pour into a nearly horizontal glass still leaves the glass 90 percent full of foam. Settles rather quickly, though. Beautiful aroma. Light fruits (peaches, apricots, bananas, citrus), flowers, corriander, grains, a splash of 10 Cane (top notch cachaca), light and crisp hops. Flavor to match with the yeast asserting itself  adding some doughy, spicy notes and a touch a sourness. Some subtle pure ethanol, also. Dry, yeasty, grainy, slightly sour finish. Medium, well carbonated. Excellently complex wit.","Florida, USA","SoLan"

4604,"2006-05-02",4.1,"Pours hazy golden gray with bright white and stable head. Initial aromas of fresh blueberry, orange, pie spices, and a touch of light springtime floral notes. The mouthfeel is exquisite with creamy bubbles and well weighted malt structure derived from the use of such a complex aray of grain. Delightful acidic pop in the mid palate which softens on the finish. A beautiful beer.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","outerupt"

Lightly sweet, lightly acidic initial flavour.  Moderately acidic, lightly bitter finish.  Lightly to medium bodied.  Lively carbonation.

The taste is round and has this lemony soury accent. It has a good mouthfeel with a clean refreshing aftertaste and a touch of ricecrackers.","St Idesbald, BELGIUM","lachesis"
4604,"2005-06-04",3.3,"White head, gone in secs; fully hazy yellow beer. Coriander (with the sackfull), perfumed, bit citrussy, and indeed, wheaty nose. Perfumed and fruity taste, coriander very obvious, but not all-conquering - though it isnt far off. Its balanced sour-sweet which is a good point. Medium bodied, very refreshing. The balance saves it. Still, next time, guys: 1/2 the amount of coriander, PLEASE. No, make that 1/3 for safetys sake...","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
