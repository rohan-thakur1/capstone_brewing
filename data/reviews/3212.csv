3212,"2015-04-14",3.1,"A pleasant smelling lager, and if I didnt know better I might say it reminds me of Bells lager of the lakes. Crisp clean malt profile, well-rested with no off flavors. Nicely balanced and quite enjoyable. Better than the UPA certainly, and a brew I hope to enjoy again.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
