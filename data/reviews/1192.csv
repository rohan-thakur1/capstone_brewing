Fantastic aroma, fresh cut tangerines, cut grass, hoppy wort. Pretty full, creamy body with flavors of butterscotch, very dense hop, creamy yeast and oat. Lots of pith, heavy bitterness mixed in.

1192,"2016-06-12",4.0,"La canette souvre sur un somptueux liquide orangé et trouble, classique des pale ales de la Nouvelle-Angleterre. Larôme est grosse, forte, puissante. De lagrume à létat pur, avec des notes dananas, doranges, de lime. Cest intéressant de voir comment le résultat est différent en bouche. Au goût, cest résineux et malté au depart, houblonné ensuite. On retrouve beaucoup le goût liquoreux de lalcool, ainsi quun corps malté très présent. Le houblon, intense au nez, est discret en bouche. Quelques gorgées et lamertume prend rapidement lascendant. Cette bière présente tout pour être heureux, mais le mélange ne me convainc pas totalement pour être de classe mondiale.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"
1192,"2016-05-30",4.2,"A big thanks to Michael for this great beer. Cheers man! Un liquide trouble à la robe orangée. Mon verre eût ressemblé à ce grand verre de jus doranges quon avale le matin, si ce navait pas été de la généreuse mousse blanche formé de bulles de différentes tailles qui ont décoré mon verre pendant de longues minutes. Dommage quen sestompant, elles naient pas laissé de dentelles sur mon verre. Un nez bien organisé dagrumes, de malts blonds et légers. Une touche mentholée comme si une feuille de menthe avait été subtilement glissée dans cette salade de fruits juteuse et aromatique. Amertume bien balancée au palais. Laromatique demeure au premier plan dans ce bol de céréales Quaker ® aux fruits frais.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

1192,"2016-05-13",4.6,"Can from trade, split 3 ways. Right on par with Alter Ego for me and I think Ill stick to trading for Alter, which doesnt require an arm, leg, and a first born child to obtain. Was def worth it and fun to finally get to try though. Pours a beautiful, bright, orange/yellow, completely cloudy, and a foamy white head. Aromas of tropical and citrus fruits, onion, dank. Love that mosaic hop. Flavor had passionfruit, orange, lemon, some pine, onion, and dank. Pretty much the same thoughts I had with Alter as well. Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a smooth finish with a hint of bitterness. Another world class beer from them.","Jamestown, New York, USA","bigda83"

1192,"2016-04-11",3.7,"Hazy orange, medium off white head, grassy and citrus hop aroma. Medium full body. Minimal alcohol. Flavor orange and pineapple hops, medium dry, compared to their other stuff more of a malty background and the hops are more restrained. Good overall but not as distinctive as many of the other tree house offerings.","Massachusetts, USA","bbbeer"
1192,"2016-04-10",3.7,"Pouring at EBF 2016. Pours a hazed gold with a thin white head. Smells of straight up onion juice with a touch of tropical fruit and mango. Hop juice all over it, big mango sweetness, long musk and onion on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

1192,"2016-03-07",4.0,"750ml growler courtesy of jamesy -- cheers! Typical ""base"" beer profile for a Tree House beer, with an orange hue, a moderately hazy look, and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. There are a lot of hops in here, but it was all surprisingly restrained to my palate. I found the same thing with Alter Ego (the single IPA version of Doppelganger) -- Amarillo and Mosaic hops have great aroma, but they are pretty tame in flavor. Despite the deScription, I wouldnt characterize this as either ""dank"" or a ""citrus bomb""; its more of a really good DIPA that smells like tropical fruit.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

1192,"2016-03-02",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2016 16 oz can from Eddie the Tree House guy. Damn is he miraculous. The pour is a foggy northeast IPA holden orange. There is a light white head and a good juicy lace as it falls to a tiny collar. The aroma is great. There is a huge dose of pine and an awesome juiciness. I wish I knew how they did it. This is great. Juicy and sweet hop with a light pine bitterness and a great hop finish. There is not a whole lot of complexity and it&apos;s very clean and crisp. I&apos;m a huge fan. The flavor is even better. The light pine bitterness starts out and the hops come rolling though beautifully. The Amarillo is really detectable in this. The juiciness is even more prevalent in the flavor and it&apos;s just exploding and wonderful. The mouth feel is a touch heavy but juicy and excellently carbonated. The aftertaste is juicy hop and is just lovely. Damn Tree House kills it.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1192,"2016-02-28",4.3,"Growler, 3 days old. Super hazy orange. Nose is what your hands smell like after picking hops all morning....big grapefruit pith and juice, dank resin. Smooth, bitter, crushable even at this alcohol which is hardly noticeable. These Treehouse IPAS are ruining all other IPAs for me. I might have to move to Monson. Dont really know what this adds over Alter Ego but damn good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

1192,"2016-02-16",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2016 Draught at EBF, 2/5/16.Heavily hazy golden pour shows a standard NE IPA with a white head that is small and shows moderate retention.Smells the part, thats for sure. Juicy, heavily aromatic, and with little/no pine/resin. Tons of tropical fruits with pineapple, honeydew, kiwi and meyer lemon. No alcohol and much like alter ego, theres a slight citrusy edge to it of grapefruit rind. But its light. Malts are in the background providing honey and light cracker.Absolutely explosively hoppy and full of juicy, lightly pungent and thoroughly bright tropical, dank, floral and melon-like notes. The extra malt here actually takes the light edge off that Alter Ego exhibited from the dry citrus character. Extremely drinkable to the nth degree here with no alcohol or flaws. Probably would still grab an Alter Ego/Julius vs this or KJ, as I dont think the extra malt/abv really add anything at this already outstanding level of hop quality, but this is certainly a nice treat. Anyone rating this below a 4.0 is just being a douchebag and/or doesnt know a good IPA when they have one.Rerate can from early May 2016 batch and 750mL filled 6/24/16.Wooooow...thats just a god damned glass of watermelon juice!!

Flavor of grapefruit, tangerine, mild pine, resinous bitterness. Strong lasting bitterness in the form of pine. Soft / delicate mouthfeel with an airy feel over the palate.
