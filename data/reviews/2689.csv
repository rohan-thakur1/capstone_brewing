2689,"2016-11-27",4.0,"Rendkívül bizalomgerjesztő szóösszetétel, szimpatikus elemeket megjelölő címke, főként annak tudatában, hogy az ""alap"" verzió, ami már önmagában is dupla élvezetet nyújt a szimpla változathoz képest, ez esetben még különlegesebb hordók pártfogását élvezte, amikor bourbon és juharszirup otthonaként szolgáló dongák között nemesedett. Ez természetesen az illatában is tetten érhető, összetéveszthetetlen whiskys hangulatok elevenednek meg, s a máskor olyan gyakran odaképzelt juharszirup aromái is szinte kézzel foghatóvá válnak. Egy kevés vanília, marcipán, parfümös illatpamacsok puha felhője is feltűnik, majd kortyokká transzformálódva az ízlelőbimbóinkon is megpihen, de éppen csak annyira, hogy azokat rögtön fel is korbácsolja az intenzív szerkezet, amiben életre kelnek. Pikáns, csípőskés jegyek sokaságát zúdítja a sörkóstolóra, mézédes, szirupos bevezető után egy fűszeres, borókabogyós, illatos sült húsos, barley wine-szerű malátamélység tárul elénk, amiben csak röviden időzhetünk, hamarosan ugyanis egy hosszan meghúzott, gömbölyűre formált, kellemesen intenzív keserűség ragadja magához az utószót. Kissé vadóc természet, talán még túlságosan is fiatalos hevületű, számomra legalábbis a Southern Charred egy hajszállal jobbnak bizonyult. Némi érlelődés nyilvánvalóan nem válna kárára, de az idő sajnos nem a legjobb barátom.","HUNGARY","adster"

2689,"2016-10-22",3.9,"500 ml bottle from Hawthorne Cellars. Pours amber with tan small to medium tan head that persists. Maple syrup comes through in the aroma.

2689,"2016-10-16",4.0,"500 ml bottle from Prost. Murky brown in color, thin fast dying head. Does it matter what it looks like?? Aroma is awfully nice; light maple syrup, coffee bean, and light bourbon. 
Flavor has the Bastards base ale (big toffee /caramel) with the maple notes and coffee notes thought the sip. The bourbon gives off some alcohol warming after the sip. The coffee comes off mildly green. Body is medium and layered with flavor. All considered, I really enjoyed this.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

2689,"2016-10-03",4.4,"12.7% ABV. Strong Ale.

Poured out deep Amber brown. 28ºSRM.

Nose has some very pleasant sweet rich dessert aromas: banoffee, pecan pie, praline pecans with the creamy rich body of a pumpkin pie. There are rich toffee, treacle aromas in the nose as well. Creme bruleé comes to mind with vanilla, caramel, burnt sugar. As the brew comes up to room temperature, you start to get less of the sweet and more of the nutty, bready and cake-like aromas with sweet dough, cookie dough, fresh biscuits, waffles and pancakes with maple syrup.

Mouthfeel is syrupy and alcohol. Palate has maple syrup, wild honey, toffee and treacle and a bunch of creamy flavors like burnt milk scorched cream before the onset of the aggressive alcoholic palate and then you get alcoholic, earthy and woody hops a slide into a thinner sweet that is reminiscent of maple sugar and then slightly bitter hops with a woody character suggesting incense or wormwood.

The finish is pleasantly and numbingly gentle.

2689,"2016-10-01",4.2,"500 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a Great Lakes snifter, the beer pours a murky reddish/brown color with about an inch tan head that stuck around for a long time. Theres also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like maple, bourbon, vanilla, candied oranges, oak, coffee and a bit of piney hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some molasses, woodiness, citrus peel and dark fruit noticeable too, along with a bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its syrupy and a bit slick with a moderate amount of carbonation.

2689,"2016-09-25",4.3,"I may actually prefer the depth charged double Bastard to this, but one is great and one is still pretty damn good. Coffee and maple get lost just a little in the more beer centric than expected and fairly beer. Barreling and coffee are there, but not huge as the double badtard base still shines. Loved trying it and have one more, but Id rather spend less for bigger bottles of depth charge. Lots going on can sometimes hamper.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

2689,"2016-08-14",3.8,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tall tulip. Kind of a murky, hazy amber with a tan head of tiny bubbles. Nose is immediately caramel, vanilla, and maple with a slight waft of booziness. Upon tipping the glass back I quickly notice that the maple barrel aging adds a sweetness that cuts the anticipated alcohol burn (12.7% ABV) to a near nothing. Lightly bitter, medium body, and creamy on the palate with rather soft carbonation. Virtually no lacing on the glass (guessing due to the alcohol?), but the hops come through with a nice bitter finish and leaves me with my lips being rather sticky. I love that. Stone has come up with a great twist on the American Strong Ale. Perfect for a cold night with a cigar by the fire.","California, USA","mezr"

Flavor is treacle, alcohol, bourbon, maple, wood and arguably some pretty strong hop whose flavors are indiscernible give all the other strong flavors. Theres a burn in the mouth - heat? hop?

2689,"2016-07-27",3.9,"50cl corked and caged bottle pours with a murky mahogany colored body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma offers up malts, malty pine hops, vanilla, soft yet spicy oak, pine sap covered biscuit malts, chocolate and then some booziness into the end of the draw. The taste delivers rich flavor where smooth rich sweet malt quickly runs into whiskey booze to start. Toward midway it picks up sweet vanilla, marshmallow, some spicy oak and plenty of near resiny pine hop bitterness. Into the finish the vanilla, soft smooth whiskey, some thin chocolate malts and spicy oak slowly close out the experience. I enjoy the barrel to beer balance going on here as the barrel hasnt crushed the beer, like most Stone barrel aged offerings.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Fresh green, peppery hop combining with fresh coffee and pistachio. Nutty coffee beans, cocoa and maple syrup down below. Altogether very woody, like split fresh wood. Nose is different every time we revisit. Bizarre flavor progression: sharp oak, toffee, maple, green leafy hops, then coffee, alcohol, back to bourbon and vanilla, then after a couple beats bitterness and alcohol kick in. Seems a little thrown together, theres no real moment of clarity. Flavors ping pong around. Too much from the barleywine aspect, the citrusy hop bitterness combats the smooth coffee and barrel notes.","","PartyFowle"

Ill be the first to say I dont like arrogant bastard. Probably because of my first encounter with it. Flippy cup with double bastard at my Halloween party of aught nine which didnt end well. Or maybe because of the odd clash of hops and malt. Either way, I wasnt expecting much. Happy to say this exceeded my expectations. This is about as good as a bastard based beer could be.
