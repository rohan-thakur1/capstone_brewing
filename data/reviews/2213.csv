2213,"2016-09-28",3.2,"Best by 11/23/16. Rusty orange. Fragmented, off-white foam. Decent aroma of breadcrust, molasses, almond, orange, chocolate-drizzled toffee (Munich), licorice, cedar and tobacco. Light notes of paper, soured fruit, apple jelly and corn starch. Opens with a full fruitiness tempered by sharp sassafras notes. Fruity acidity sneaks in with a borderline overripe quality, and a stewed peach note taints things by adding weight to the body which greatly interferes with the subtler malt textures. Bouncy pale malt throws bouncy grass and uncured hay suggestions about, although it flirts at husky with its stale popcorn dimensions. Dabs of wet paper and apple jelly also bring in some flabbiness which tarnishes the otherwise clean and well-structured malt. Rich breadcrust signature restores the malty fullness, as notes of fallen leaves and nut skins augment the earthiness and aid the structure with a multilayered yet pleasingly dry quality. Malt is not exactly bursting with texture or detail, however. Licoricey hops prolong the malt with an assertive punch in the toasty, chewy-nutty and slightly raisiny, but well-attenuated, finish. Saccharine notes plague the finish as they linger amid hints of cedar. Theres a lot to like about this serviceable marzenbier, such as the balance and the earthcentric malt character. However, it would be markedly improved with some simple tweaks. I cant help but wonder if the generic malt bill were simplified and decoction-mashed, exchanging those dreaded wet-paper defects for some melanoidins and finer textures. Decent...just not quite there yet.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

A: Pours a coppery clear golden-orange, which forms a thin head that dissipates quickly into a ring of bubbles around the glass.

S: Doughy, yeasty malt, much like an uncooked biscuit, with some faint spice hints and a touch of non-sweet caramel.

T: Sweet toast and a bit of caramel hit up front, followed by a doughy yeastiness that rounds out and balances the sweetness nicely. Theres some faint spiciness to this marzen, like a touch of cinnamon. As could be expected in any malt-forward lager, there are some undertones of toffee and caramel, though with decidedly less sweetness than one might expect. The finish is composed almost entirely of the GLBC yeast, with a slightly grassy, leafy tone.

M: Flat, but in precisely the way a marzen should be, with minimal carbonation. The feel across the palate is light, without a watery finish (GLBC is good at avoiding that issue with every beer of theirs Ive had).

O: Thats a good, tasty marzen, relying on malt and yeast to provide the bulk of the flavor profile, while spice and hops remain comfortably in the background.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

I drank 3 of these in about 20 minutes, and in doing so I went back in time to 1990 when I attended an Oktoberfest in Munich. I could smell the bratwurst cooking as I went from beer tent to beer tent drinking each offering and swiping unattended empty liter mugs into my backpack (I believe I acquired 8 that day). This beer made me miss three things about Germany: 1.) German unadulterated Lowenbrau, b.) Singing shamelessly and out of tune along with music in a language I hardly understood, 3.)

Fairly clean palate with the right weight; sticky initial finish with smacking sugared cereal sweetness fading into a papery woodsiness long after. A balanced, satiating malt presentation this is not, but it is well composed.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
2213,"2014-09-02",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2015 I tasted this blind and got a rating w/in .1 of the original. *pats self on back* This is clear, bright orange. Its a bit floral, sweet and mildly oxidized. Its got a bit of a fruity ale yeast character to it, which is fine but not to style if you care, w/ some dusty/musty notes as well. Pretty tasty Oktoberfest overall. 

Original (3.3):This is a malty lager beer that is ultimately a little too sweet for its own good but decent nevertheless. It is a nice orange color w/ a small head. It smells of lovely toasted malt w/ a bit of earthy herbal character as well. Caramel takes front in center once its tasted. It comes off as oversweet on the first sip but it settles down quickly and becomes nice and drinkable--esp. for something that is on the strong side for the style. It finishes w/ some lingering toffee notes and a touch of earthy bitterness. This falls just a bit short in terms of malt character but is better than most American craft examples of this style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

2213,"2014-08-01",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 8-28-12 - 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a medium orange color with a one finger dense white head. The head had decent retention and faded to give way to a moderate amount of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma of a light roasted malt and some caramel. There is some toasted bread notes and a light spicy hop aroma that are mixed within.

 Taste  The taste begins of a caramel flavor and a great roasted malt and biscuit taste. As the taste advances some of the caramel fades as some light hop flavors of a more herbal note come to the tongue. These flavors crisp up the taste toward the end and leave a smooth, slightly roasted and lightly hopped malty flavor on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly higher then average side in terms of creaminess with the carbonation level being quite average. The body was fantastic for the roasted flavors of the brew while the carbonation level helped to give just the right amount of crispness to the brew as some of the sweeter flavors left the taste profile.

 Overall - Very easy drinking with some wonderful tastes as well as a nice smooth feel. Quite nice.","","Darkmagus82"

Finding one of these left over from a party I figured that I would knock out an easy tick. The result was a decent enough beer in line with most of the Great Lakes offerings. This particular release will not have you rethinking the style but is a nice local for those in the Midwest.

Aroma / Appearance - A mostly transparent base is coppery and warm. Yellowy offwhite head is the hue of melting snow. Spicy almonds, caramel, and semisweet malts tickle the air. This isnt rich and thick; instead it goes for the inviting angle of being a little mysterious.

Flavor / Palate - Vanilla, cream ale, hazelnut, and almonds are a nutty introduction to a malt driven oktoberfest. Soft on the tongue it almost melts rather than developing on the throat.. The result is something enjoyable without being a standout. I would certainly not turn one down at the bar but I dont think I would go out of my way to buy it either.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

T: A touch of the caramel-y sweetness does appear initially, but the real star of the show is how juicy it seems to be - and how much of that juiciness seems to come from the hop profile. Apricot, apple, peach, and pineapple make up the bulk of the flavors around the middle, with some bitter hoppiness finishing it off.

M: It has a fairly light body, with a rather wet finish. Normally, Id prefer a drier beer, but since the flavors are so good, I dont care. Carbonation is middling, which I like.

O: This is unusual. Why? Because its not a marzen I want to chug - its a marzen I want to savor. How Great Lakes crams so much fruity flavor into their lagers, Ill never know. Id put this up near the top of all the oktoberfest beers Ive ever sampled. If my last review said I wouldnt have minded getting a six pack of the beer in question (STs 2XRYE), then Ill state in this I kind of wish I got a six pack instead of a single.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Shes a voluptuous beauty whos had her share of brezen, weisswurts, and obatzda, but she perfectly fills out her dirndl in full. Among all these Marzens, what is it about this one that has you hiding the bulge in your lederhosen? Her dark copper color helps her stand out from the rest as she pours into your glass with the thickness you expected.  As soon as you bring her to your lips, she surrounds you with a warm comfort, both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time; her aroma matches evenly with her sweet taste.  She is ready for fun and her hearty laugh makes you smile with each sip.  After unraveling the strings on her dirndl blouse and voraciously dropping to her knees, you are overwhelmed with her lascivious mouthfeel but also a looming sorrow: this tryst will last but a few days.  Alas, Octoberfest wasnt meant to last all year, so grab her by her thick curves and dive in head first.  You might as well: shes been patiently waiting for you all year with a tankard in one hand and a motel key in the other.

Yep, dark beer should be consumed at warmer temperatures in order to better facilitate unmasked delivery of the flavors.  But I say when a warmer temp brings worse taste, maybe the beer at hand is better left masked by chilliness.  Nonetheless, it was a pretty good, middle-of-the-road Oktoberfest.  Id give it a B within the Oktoberfest style. Relatively speaking, its not as enjoyable as other styles from Great Lakes, where they tend to brew an above average quality at below average prices.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

2213,"2012-08-29",3.9,"A very decent octoberfest.  Pours light orange.  Has a medium body and average head.  Has a nice amount of subtle spicing, some nuttiness, citrus, and toast in the flavor and aroma.  Tried with Dave at Kumas Corner in Chicago, August, 2012.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
2213,"2012-08-26",3.7,"(bottle)  Pours a clear copper/orange color with a very thin white head that quickly diminishes to a very patchy consistency.  Little lacing.  Aroma smells of roasted barley, buttered sweet corn (in a big way), and some musty lager yeastiness.  That buttered sweet corn diminishes thankfully as it warms, and is replaced by some spikes of noble hoppiness.  Bit of peanut brittle, which I get often in the GL beers.  This nose really opens up with warming, and Im starting to really dig it, but with further warming, the scent reverts back to sweet corn and beet territory.  Really weird.  The flavor is superbly composed for an O-fest, with a good base of roasted barley that is layered with a pleasant caramel sweetness on top. Little kicks of noble hops greet the tongue when this fades to the finish.  Its a good combo. of toasty malt mixed with the hops, as no one element dominates the other.  This reminds me in a way of a pumpkin beer which has been stripped of the spices and pumpkin.  Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is appropriate.  Overall this is a solid Oktoberfest, and I certainly wouldnt object to drinking a stein of this, although the scent morphing was puzzling.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

2213,"2011-10-14",3.6,"I poured a 12oz bottle into an Oktoberfest mug.Appearance: Dark amber/light orange color; almost crystal-clear body; an aggressive pour knocks out almost all carbonation and causes a large, frothy, beige head which laces and retains very well.Smell: Classic lager aroma at the core but with distinct sweeter aromas of a confectionary nature. Slight sourness as well (could be because my bottle was set to expire a week later).Taste: Ive never been a big fan of Oktoberfest beers, German or American because were told theyre more than just fizzy yellow lagers but they taste so similar to what they claim they arent. Great Lakes Oktoberfest is one of the few American examples that actually tastes like a refined, crafted brew. Right away it imparts some confectionary sweetness of light caramel and toffee notes, followed by a quick biscuity malt backbone and accompanying bitterness. It finishes slighty dry and bitter, akin to something doughy or pasty. I can still taste the underlying lager lineage to this beer, though. Considering mine was an old bottle Id like to believe a fresher version would be sweeter, more complex and more robust, but even as it stands its still pretty satisfying. Mouthfeel: Thicker than your average lager, flatter and more comfortable too. Drinkability: For a 6.5% ABV lager, Great Lakes Oktoberfest is surprisingly light on its toes. Theres no alcohol presence or sheer density to the palate or constitution. It seems as though it would be highly sessionable, considering its pleasant taste and drinker-friendly delivery of a comfortable mouthfeel and smooth finish. Not much to be gained with food pairing, but it wouldnt hurt, either.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Pours a deep amber with a fluffy head that leaves a lot of lacing, a very good looking example of the style.

Perhaps the breadiest smelling Oktoberfest out there, it is very malty with a slight bit of caramel nuttiness in there. Hops are there but do not add much to the scent profile.

The taste is a lot hoppier, like drinking bread mixed with hops. It isnt the most delicate or precision crafted flavor but it is a solid and unique addition to the category and follows the general guidelines. The mouthfeel is spot on for an Oktoberfest in this brew.

Overall it is a solid addition to the Oktoberfest category, not the best one but worthy if you see it and want to try it.

Smells slightly sweet with some caramel. Not too much depth. Taste is similar with a faint hoppiness. Light caramel touch. Mouthfeel is nice. Medium body and good carbonation. Slightly creamy. Drinkability is average. Nothing spectacular here. Not quite malty enough to fit into the German-type Oktoberfest, and doesnt have the hop feel of some of the better American Octoberfests.

2213,"2010-11-30",3.0,"Bottle via trade with jsquire, thanks Jeff! Pours medium amber with a 1 finger, creamy, off white head. Aroma is toasted nuts, cereal grain, white bread crust and a chili pepper-like vegetal note. Flavor is sweet grain, nuts, floral hops and the same chili-like vegetable note, no heat to it of course, but it really tastes a lot like a lightly roasted Anaheim. The peppery note is weird, and might be an off note, but I actually kinda liked it at first, but it sort of lingers and becomes a little celery like. Palate is light to medium bodied, creamy and a little sticky with a light carbonation seems to cling to the tongue a bit with that lingering pepper taste. Decent Oktoberfest even with the weirdness.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

The Oktoberfest pours a nice solid golden color, not quite copper, but note quite straight ""gold.""  The nose gives the first indication that this example is going to be stylistically excellent.  Hints of rich malt and a touch of German noble hops come through.  Flavors coming through on the palate are equally splendid.

Tap @ MapRoom. A clean and satisfying lager that did not have the charm that other comparables from the same brewery display.

I like:
Focused on toastiness, direct Vienna malt aroma: bready, approaching nutty and gently toasty, but it has a certain huskiness and does not feel fresh the same way than an Eliot Ness can. 

I dislike:
The small white head quickly departs from the clear light amber pour. A certain huskiness coats the palate. I quickly grew tired of my pint, which should not happen with a lager.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Great Lakes Oktoberfest pours a crystal clear glowing amber with hints of orange. Large carbonation bubbles rise to the two finger head that formed on the pour. The head fell to a thick creamy cap and left some lacing on its way down. Leaves nice drink lines after each sip. 

The aroma come forward with large amounts of Munich malt and lesser amounts of toasted grains. The Munich comes across chewy with a touch of caramel and a slight earthiness.

This is a glass full of malt. Munich malt. Starts off with a chewy nuttiness and leads effortlessly, mid-palate, to an earhtiness. A slightly sweet grain huskiness comes through on the swallow making this an enjoyable Oktoberfest.

The body on this octoberfest is medium with a silky smooth creamy mouthfeel. Lazy carbonation lets this beer glide through the mouth.

Lives up to the status of an octoberfest in that its easy enough to put away pint after pint.

Great Lakes Oktoberfest hits the spot on a crisp fall evening like tonight. One of the great American breweries comes along with another great American German Style beer. If that makes sense to anyone.

Caramel, hazelnuts and maple sugar coated brown bread bring in nasal exclamations while a toasted whole wheat signature rides the coattails of the back scent. Toffee and talc line the nose as caramelized pistachios and leavened brown bread segway into the flavors dominion. Caramel and toffee join forces for full bodied sweetness, complimenting the humming crème brule cap that flew on top of the hazelnut whole wheat loaf. Oats gets sifted through sticky maple sugar sap and ironed out on English toffee nougat. The noble hop support is simply striking. Expansive dominion for the perfectly leveled carbonation lends more chewy, synchronic grist as the palate smacks the caramel crust sweetened oat laden bread loafs into a finish that stays true to the first sniff and sip.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

2213,"2007-08-25",4.1,"Appealing brownish golden color.  Aroma of caramel malt and a hint of hops.  This beer is remarkably smooth with pleasant malt and subtle yet balanced hops flavors.  This gives the Ayinger oktoberfest a serious challenge! for the title of my favorite beer of this style, and may even surpass it.  Very enjoyable!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"
2213,"2007-08-25",2.5,"The aroma is of bready malts, it pours a clear amber, with a small white head.  The taste is pretty much toast and bread malts, very little hop, and not what Im looking for in a beer at all.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
2213,"2007-08-24",3.5,"12 oz. bottle via trade with dankman38 - Pours a clear bright amber color with a one finger thick off white head.  Light spotty lacing.  Aroma is grassy hops and bread malt.

2213,"2007-08-23",3.5,"Bright copper color with an average creamy light beige head. LIght aromas of lightly toasted malthouse barley. Hints of floral hops. Very smooth and creamy feel, perhaps a bit too much so as this has a thickness that starts to become mouthcoating, but there is a acidity that thins it back out in the finish. Crisp and lightly acidic. Mild sourdough flavors. Touches of caramel and toasted biscuits. This one has a sharpness that is uncharacteristic of lagers/oktoberfests. Still a nice brew. This will be a good one for the warmer indian summer days this fall.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2213,"2007-08-23",4.0,"Bottle.  Dark and brownish copper body with a pretty nice two finger head sitting on top.  Aromas are a lovely mixture of caramel like sweet and slightly roasted malts, damp earth, a touch of floral hops and bread dough.  My first impression is that the mouthfeel is fairly heavy and I really like the effect.  Flavor is thick and full:  malt is on center stage, but there is a bit of a floral hops that lingers in the side wings, peeking around the curtain at times.  Honey is a good descriptor of the sweetness and almost syrupy thickness, but this is darker than honey...  At any rate, this is a fabulous Oktoberfest... cant wait to pick up more!","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
2213,"2007-08-22",4.3,"Hands down, this is the best Oktoberfest Ive EVER had.  Ill be buying more of this.  The bottle is best by 10/24/2007.  Pours to a golden falling leaf colored amber body with a really creamy, rocky white head.  The aroma is awesome.  Crisp grains, nicely toasted pale malts, seemingly has specialty malts too.  I swear it has a pumpkin or squash quality.  Perhaps its just the unique combination of malts and hops.  Nice balanced noble hops.  Pure autumn in a bottle.  The flavor is full of toasty malts, crisp grains, noble hops.  Nice smooth bitterness seems to have a brown sugar and butternut squash thing going on under the malts.  Whatever they used, this is the best Oktoberfest Ive ever had.  Nice bitterness on the palate is followed by a great texture, crispness, medium body.  Man, I could drink this one all the time.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
2213,"2007-08-22",3.8,"1st Oktoberfest of 2007, and its a good one. First Id like to personally thank Great Lakes for deciding to bottle this gem. Amber-copper pour, sparkles in the glass. Big diminishing white head with some spotty lace. Im greeted by a scent of honey roasted goodness, faint yet firm. Real nice malt nose that improves as it warms. Soft on the palate with a full body of creamy malts and a sprinkling of bitterness. Flavor is big and malty, roasted with a nice nutty flavor coupled by sweet honey. A touch of caramel and a complimentary hop aspect create a well rounded and balanced beer. ""Roll out the barrel!""","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
2213,"2007-08-21",3.0,"Pours an amber color with an off-white head.  Aroma is of toasted malts, carmel, floral hops, and some spices.  Flavor is pretty strong of the toasted malts up front that give way to carmel and spices and finishes with just a hint of floral hops and some earthiness.  This brew is alright but not even close to my favorite from Great Lakes.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Lowe1983"

Finish is peppery and slightly earthy.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

2213,"2007-08-15",3.5,"8/09/2007:  Great Lakes Oktoberfest pours a transparent pale amber-orange color with a fomay dark beige head.  There is a moderate level of visible carbonation.  The aroma is a nice blend of European malt and noble hops with a hint of tea and toasted grains.  Toasted malt and some very, very weak coffee-like tones can be found in the flavor.  The mildy sweet maltiness of the flavor is well matched with some lightly roasted malt and chocolate.  The flavor is kind of strong with a nice, grassy and slightly spicy hop bite in the finish.  This medium-bodied beer is wonderful to drink on a hot day, or any day really!  This is definitely one of the better Oktoberfest beers I have had lately.

Taste is not exactly in-your face -- good, but thin and weaker than I would like.  I prefer Eliot Ness.","Texas, USA","BenDover"
2213,"2007-08-08",3.9,"This beer is really for those people who like malts, yeast and, just the enough hops.  I like this beer, its not too intense but has plenty of flavor and, a little bitterness to boot.","Somewhere in, Ohio, USA","dankman"

2213,"2007-07-25",3.7,"Copper pour, nice white head. Sweet crystal malt aroma. Flavor is a blast of biscuit malt, I say it everytime but I love that malt. A sweet caramel taste rides along as well as some subtle vienna spiciness. Floral hops but more on bitterness than actual flavor. This may be the best Oktoberfest style beer Ive had as far as drinkability, very smooth, good amount of flavor not too much or too little, and just an easy beer to drink that I ordered 2 glasses of and hardly ever do that.","Brook Park, Ohio, USA","crizay"

This has a rich and thick mouthfeel with a wonderful smoothness. Caramel sweetness is cut just a little by light bittering. Doesnt finsih too sweet or sticky, but I wouldnt call it dry either. Seems like just the right balance for the style. This is certainly one of the better Marzens that Ive had  - rich  and satisfying.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

Lighly carbonated mouthfeel, making drinking these one after the other quite plausible!

The supreme nose is rich caramel malt and butterscotch.  Pours clear copper with a frothy
off-white to beige head that leaves the scene quickly.  The brew starts very malty but the
balance is stellar and the depth is deceptive.  The medium, dry and soft body feels very
astringent at the finish.  The biggest surprise of the night for me at the brewpub.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

The beer is much lighter in color and body than other Octoberfests.  The color is light brown, and the head did stay awhile.  The smell and flavor are just to light for me.  The beer has a very good taste of malt and hops.  But the flavor is not strong, and it has no aftertaste.  Still worth a try as it does have a good following from others.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","TINOZACCA"

Aroma is very sweet with some floral notes.  Flavor was very sweet, though crisp at the same time.  A lot of depth to the flavor too, not watery at all like some fests.  My one friend remarked he felt like he was drinking a piece of candy which i wouldnt say is a far off description.  Overall I thought it was a very good beer, but not one you could have more of due to the sweetness.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","roder60"
