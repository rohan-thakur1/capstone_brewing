Watery appearance. Blandish sake aroma, a bit dirty and dusty. Flat watery palate, some alcohol heat. Sweet ricey taste. Does cover the 16%. Does nothing for me. Sweet and bland.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

1609,"2006-01-12",4.3,"Crystal clear, very thick clear legs. The nose is sweet and eligant with notes of lemongrass, grapes, bubblegum and a pleasant spring floral freshness. The air smells much fresher coming from my glass than what Im breathing in around me. The flavor is light with some earthy rice notes but moreover a subtle alcohol, tons of umami and a very crisp and clean with a light bitter snap in the tail. The finish is clean and bright with melon notes. This is a very fine and beautiful sake. Alcohol is present but not overly so; only there to add some fruitiness.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
