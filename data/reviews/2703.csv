To be honest, the only reason I bought this was to see if theres a beer style so boring, Mikkeller cant do anything with it. Damn you Mikkeller! You managed to make a near-hop bomb out of a low gravity pale lager? What the hell is up with that? Great beer. Probably the best lager Ive ever had. (18/20)","CANADA","UXO"
2703,"2014-12-10",3.6,"Bottle from Mane Liquor shared with Gooding. As with all Pils/Lagers from Mikkeller, this is a winner. Probably not as clean or hop driven as El Celler or American Dream but still driven by the hops and goes down in a balanced fashion. Have always enjoyed his lighter hop driven lagers and this is another going down well. Winner","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
