2530,"2016-02-14",2.9,"0.33 l bottle from De Bierkoning, best before May 2017. Clear, golden amber with a massive, dense, stable, tan to white head. Faint, fruity-grassy, minimally floral aroma of straw, lime and peach. Slightly bitter, moderately fruity-grassy and minimally floral taste of straw, lime and peach, followed by a short, grassy, dry and moderately bitter finish.

Dry and spicy in taste, slight caramel. Carbonation gives some extra feel of body, which is good.
