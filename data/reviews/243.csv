Body: Mid to light body. Slick and crisp palate.

Mouth Feel: Good lager maltyness in a slightly thinned but smooth background. Clean and dry with strong floral and light sweetness. Biscuity and hoppy with light lemon to round. Breezy and nice!

Comments: This one is very malty in a well-attenuated body, with nice fruity ester aroma and flowery. Clean, easy and strongly hoppy. This brewer really knows their German styles and do it well. A joy!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
243,"2016-07-29",3.8,"13th Anniversary version. Lovely floury malty aroma, light grassy and herbal hoppiness. Taste is good. Light bittereness, high on the maltiness, guess thats the unfiltered aspect maybe. Little bit of hops at the end. Very quaffable indeed.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"

Light bitterness and crisp and refreshing carbonation. Quite delicious on a hot day and seems to brewed well to style. Quite enjoyable.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
243,"2016-05-28",3.3,"Pours quite clear, whitish golden with a decent head. Aroma is simple grainy, at first I was getting some orange but it faded. Taste is relatively light, some fruitiness in there, light, crisp and refreshing. I think its a good kolsch, not really that special as a beer but as for this style, pretty good.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
243,"2015-08-30",3.5,"Bottle shared at GBBF 2015, day 2 - London. Thanks to Phil (KansaiBeerLvrs)! Pours clear yellow with a frothy white head. The aroma has dry cereal and straw. Light sweet flavor with some dried cereal, mild dough, faintly bitter straw - little else. Light bodied with fine to average carbonation. Moderately clean on the finish, with more dominant pale cereal character. A simple kolsch. Fine.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

243,"2013-06-04",3.5,"10th Anniversary Colonia. Part of the Anniversary 3-pack from the brewery via Rakuten. The anniversary beer. 5% super clear gold with a fast disappearing head. No real aroma. A crisp lager/pilsner body with minor hay notes & a clean bitter finish. My buddy Tonys favorite of the 3 in the set. A pretty good lager. I am not a big lager guy but it is a top quality lager!","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

243,"2011-06-10",3.6,"Draught at Q-Brick. Nice cloudy golden color with a low head. Pretty. Citrus hop aroma. Ruch, full malt, flavor, with honey and crackers, nice citrus hops. Medium bitterness. Very malty and full bodied for a Kolsch, yet refreshing and tasty, and still pretty authentic kolsch character. Good summer beer.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
