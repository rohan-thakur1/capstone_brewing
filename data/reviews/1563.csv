1563,"2010-11-01",3.8,"Bottle thanks to the Sushi Bar! Pours a mostly clear color. A rich aroma of pear, grains, earthy dust, some floral component. Very dry, almost sucks out the water in your mouth. A huge flavor if old dusty pears and apples, some vanilla perhaps. Akin to a well made apple cider. Enjoyable.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"

1563,"2007-10-16",4.3,"Bottle @ RBSG 07 Minneapolis: Clear, thick legs, nose of sweet plum and grape, ripe melon and very light alcohol. Subtle peach and no koji or rice notes. Super clean, no butteriness, clean, fresh and explosively tasty. A truly beautiful sake. The favor is semi-sweet, light coconut and a touch of alcohol to remind you youre still drinking an alcoholic beverage.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1563,"2007-07-10",3.9,"The only oSake sampled at the RBSG 07 Grand Tasting. Supplied by BückDich, this sake pours a clear wine body with no bubbles or particles. VIscosity test (alcohol) has deep legs after spinning hte beverage. Aroma of honeydew mellons, pepper, and sweetened rice. Taste is high alcoholic, semi-sweet and a nice watermellon aftertaste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1563,"2007-07-09",4.1,"RBSG 2007 Grand Tasting - Aquafina clear and still.  Nose held notes of melon, florals, and honeysuckle.  Sweet honey rice flavor with ripe melon and florals form start to finish.  ABV is well hidden.  Thin, yet slick and smooth.  Not a huge sake fan, but I know a good one when I have it.  Thanks for sharing Jordan...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
1563,"2007-07-08",3.0,"Bottle... RBSG 07...Crystal clear and colorless. According to previous ratings, it has nice legs, but I have no idea what that means. I couldnt find it in the RB glossary of terms so someone might want to add that one. As I was saying, it basically looks like water. My nose is pulling tons of fennel from the glass; very pleasant. The flavor is sweet and the body is light with a watery mouthfeel. Despite that sweet, watery nature, this baby totally dries out by the time Im ready for another sip. Thats a good thing in my book, but in the world of sake? It works for me nonetheless. Overall, I enjoyed it, but not as much as previous raters. Its fairly highly rated and probably expensive. What else can be said? Kudos to BückDich for supplying the bottle. Although I really dont know what I just consumed, it surely furthered my experience, knowledge and expectations regarding this ancient style of brew.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

1563,"2007-06-30",3.6,"RBSG 2007: Bottle thanks to Jordan: Poured clear with some nice legs. Aroma, rice, some fruity notes in the back ground. Flavor, rice, fruits, some sweetness, spice, I never would have guessed it at 15%. Im not much of a sake drinker but this was pretty solid.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
1563,"2007-06-28",3.7,"Sampled at the RBSG 07 Grand Tasting.  Almost no color on this sake.  Subtle rice scent with a smooth sweet rice taste.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
1563,"2007-06-28",4.0,"RBSG 2007.  Thanks to Jordan for sharing this!  Pours to a watery body with awesome legs.  The aroma is full of coconut and cantaloupe, honey dew, and delicate rice.  The flavor is honey dew, coconut, and other sweet fruits like starfruit and watermelon.  The palate is sweet up front and dry on the finish and the high alcohol is nicely covered.  I had a couple of samples.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
