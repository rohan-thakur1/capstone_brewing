2366,"2017-04-06",3.9,"A very interesting beer. Not as approachable as the nail red ale but the malt backbone definitely seems to have more to it. Nice caramel and burnt toffee flavours complemented with a heavy dose of earthy hops.

2366,"2017-02-24",3.8,"330ml bottle bought at YATA in MOKO, Mong Kok.
Looks: Translucent amber ruby colour with a thin trace of yeast sediments; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy off-white foam which fades in 10 seconds; Fair sticky lacing with barely notable slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant rich Amber malt, with strong toastyness, strong Sherry, mustiness, alcohol, grapefruit, strong red fruits, caramel, floral, molasses, dry bread, strong lemon and light grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet full Amber malt, with grapefruit zest, strong red fruits, light caramel, floral, light molasses, strong herbs, spices, earth, dry biscuits, yeast, strong lemon and very strong bitter grassy hops. 

Body: Mid to light body; Quite slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong Amber maltyness in a slightly thinned background. Very toast malty with long dryness and red fruits. Hoppy grapefruit zest sharp herbal grass backs things up. Booze is not that strong but omnipresent like shadow of strong Belgian Ambrée. Floral with moderate sweetness, dry cream crackers with strong lemon to round. Very nice!

Hoppiness: Grapefruit, floral, strong lemon and light grass in nose. Strong herbs, grapefruit zest, floral, spices, earth, strong lemon and very strong grass in taste; Bitterness is strong for a lasting, high astringent bitter-sweet toast malty finish.

After taste: Very dry. Herbal citrus and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is what you get when an Amber Ale get pumped up and nasty - very strong toasted red fruit maltyness, big citrusy hops with sharp grassy bitterness, and with an surprising musty Sherry nose and detoxed Ambrée taste. Lean, dry and mean, and its good! A yes for me!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2366,"2016-07-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2016 Colore ambra molto scuro, bello, con schiuma compatta e pannosa di colore giallognolo. Al naso un bel aroma erbaceo e luppolato con una interessante speziatura . Anche al palato la base dolce è subito contrastata da un deciso amaro, con erbe, luppolo e lievito.

2366,"2016-06-25",2.9,"My first Kaiju! ale so straight into it. Pours with high effervescence and vigour raising a good two inches of rocky, beige foam. Head holds proud and needs to be chewed off. The body of beer a claret red and just shy of bright. Herbaceous, heavily resinous and sappy whole hop nose with hints of caramelised peach and cumquat, strawberry and stewed rhubarb, bitter gourd and camphor. The carbonation is quite biting on the palate so I decanted it into another glass to free up the prickly mouthfeel. Chewy, biscuity and nutty sweet malts give it a pleasant backbone to the assertive hopping. Resinous and oily with so much pine, camphor and abrasive bitter notes to leave a lasting impression on the palate between sips. A plump amount of fruit peaks through similar to the nose with just a hint of candied orange and grapefruit. It site heavy in the stomach and being rather gassy it certainly saw quite a few belches apologised for by myself to my wife next to me. One was enough. It sweetens, as it warms, to the point of becoming overly heavy and gammy. Whilst I dont dislike this ale, Id love to see it toned down and balanced out more. Not bad, just not that great either!

2366,"2016-02-10",3.6,"Bottle. Very clear reddish amber with a large pale beige head. Aroma of caramel, pine, mango, some grapefruit. The pines prominence gives hope that the likely sweetness will be managed. Medium bodied, creamy texture. Not all that sweet as it turns out, with toffee and toasty flavours dispatched rapidly by quite high bitterness accompanied by pine, pepper and tropical fruit. Very clean. That the aromatics and the bitterness are unimpeded has a good side of course, but the downside is that its not got a lot of character.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

Its an all out assault on the palate - big hop notes of citrus, grass, pine & ripe fruits, balanced wit nutty, toasty malts. Plenty of bitterness, long finish.
