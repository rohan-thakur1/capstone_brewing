2750,"2017-04-18",3.5,"16floz can (~$8/four-pack), canned on 03.08.2017, poured into a pint glass. Copper in color, check. Piney and citrus aroma, check. Wait theres more, Bitter, but possesses enough of a malt to provide a caramel biscuit backdrop.This may be a red lager, but far from any traditional lager. Its good. although it could be better with more malt - a la American strong dark lager with a hoppy presence.","","balloonbuffoon"

2750,"2016-05-28",3.7,"Half of a 16 oz. can, consumed on 5-26-16. Floral aroma features toasted malts. Citric, piney smell features scents of tonic water and lemon from the hops. Pours a clear, medium to dark copper with a very large amount of golden beige head. Probably too much head. Uneven head and thick lacing. I really like the flavor. Maillard reaction evident; caramelized. Nice and dry taste. Lightly citric flavor; grapefruit. Light to medium body. Not as crisp as a lager should be in the palate. Soft. Im quite impressed overall.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
