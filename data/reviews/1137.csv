1137,"2017-06-15",4.4,"12oz bottle pours a golden color without any head. Low carb. Mild sourness. Lovely balance of the hops and funk that melds seamlessly. Very easy drinking.","California, USA","Bule"
1137,"2017-06-13",4.4,"Bottle: Pours fully cloudy dark yellow with some fizz. Aroma: Initially intensely hoppy, could smell the dry hop notes of citrus, tropical fruit and earthiness while pouring. After tasting, the notes of tart lemon, funk, white grape, and light yeast dominate. Taste is generously sour with funk and subtle notes of white wine and wood, complex and interesting. Also a nice silky finish on the palate that isnt overwhelming. Overall: Came in with no expectations (except for seeing how cloudy it was through the bottle) and was happily surprised. I drank a fresh version but I wonder how it would stand up to time. Only downside is Im bummed I got a small bottle instead of a large one.","Ontario, CANADA","DanDan_"

1137,"2017-02-03",4.3,"bytemesis for the win. Thanks, bud!  Batch No. 5  
Pours a staggeringly effervescent strawed yellow. Head is noticeably vigorous and assertive, but its plump roundness makes it a lovable fuzz.  I smell strong fragrances of melted Neapolitan ice cream, bosc pear skins, dried (and diced) apricot, canned pineapple juice, mint sprigs, sourdough starter, and cave minerality. Leaving the glass out to warm does nothing to change its aromas.  Sourdough starter through --bready, yeasty, and acidic. Waves of mint, aged hops, microflora, sourdough, bread yeast, pineapple, dried apricot, sweat, and unripe guava invade the flavor as if it were a country America is currently in war with. Lovely. What a fantastic beer.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

1137,"2016-08-03",4.4,"Bottle @ Home. Was super excited to come across this one. Cloudy orange colored beer with a tall white head. This is good. Holy smokes. Huge tropical fruit and citrus aromas here. Grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit, and guava. Sort of a catty, green grape funk to it as well. Sweet melon comes through on the tongue along with the nice citric, zesty citrus notes and tropical fruit flavors. Slight yeast and some grassy funk. Really similar to the best of the Jolly Pumpkin and Anchorage farmhouse/sour/funky beers.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1137,"2016-04-29",4.1,"750 ml. bottle from Perrys. Batch 5. It pours a mostly clear orange color with a white head that shrinks rather quickly. The aroma is really nice. Tons of brett and hops. Funky and tangy with orange, wood, barnyard, passionfruit, grape. Awesome. It reminds me of a Jolly Pumpkin or Anchorage beer, only hoppier. The flavor has lots of wine barrel, orange, passionfruit, vanilla, wet hay, and grape. Pretty much the same as the aroma, only more barrel influence. Very tart, but not overtly sour. Lightly spicy yeast notes in the finish with more barrel and funk. Low bitterness. Lots of hop flavor though. This was really good. Sudwerk getting into the sour game and killing it with this one! Seek it out.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

1137,"2015-12-11",4.8,"Bottle courtesy of Håkan. Pours very hazy deep yellow with a frothy white head that leaves lots of thick sticky lacing on the glass while dissipating. Smell is fruity and grassy with crackers, lemon juice, grapefruit juice, mango, papaya, pineapple, passion fruit, star fruit, moist grass, pine needles, minerals and lemon zest. Taste is tiny sweet, sour, slightly grassy and crazy fruity. Mouthfeel is dry, tart and medium bodied. Finish is sour with crackers, white bread, lemon juice, grapefruit juice, mango, papaya, passion fruit, star fruit, white grapes, moist grass, pine needles, minerals, barnyard and lemon zest. Intense dry hopped sour saison. The fruitiness is just mind blowing and the rest of the beer with its barrel character and funk is pretty close to perfect.

1137,"2015-10-19",4.3,"Capped 750 shared by Marcus. Pours translucent gold with a slight, transient white head. Aroma is uber fruity - lots of fruits from under the Southern Cross. Especially the Nelson. Med body or nearly. Flavor is earthy, some sort of bacterial result, and a lot of floral/fruit hop. Its pretty dry, and its rather citrus bitter. The flavor is just WOW!","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

1137,"2015-09-26",4.4,"The beer pours a medium yellow gold. Its clouded through, a glowy mass of color. Voluminous white head, fairly rocky. Pretty solid lacing. The aroma is funk and sour citrus saison goodness. Lime, tangerine, grape, peach, pepper, grass. Solid bretty funk. Its bitey citrus juice on top of a funky, fresh grain base. Light oak. Nice vinous note in the mix. Taste is moderately sour with very mild bitterness and a little bit of oak astringency. More juicy hop flavor with that spicy edge. Very juicy stuff. Nice blend of hops and sour flavor, probably helped by a light, soft but rich saison base. Its a very bright, drinkable beer. Soft, full mouthfeel. This is a very pleasant surprise from Sudwerk. They should make more beers like this because its legitimately comparable with other top sour saisons. It could use a little more funk depth, but this beer is already delicious as is.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Aroma is very citra-esque, dank, tropical, passionfruit, some cat piss, stonefruit, hints of dust and Brett as well. Flavor is fairly dry, fruity, light Brett funk and an explosion of hoppy flavors, along with a nice woody vinous note. Light tartness accentuates the fruity hops and vinous barrel well.
