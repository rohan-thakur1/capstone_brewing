1622,"2013-01-24",3.2,"375 ml bottle to snifter (served chilled). Looks good for sake; still and clear with legs from the alcohol if you swirl it. Smells and tastes of almond and plum with some perfuminess. Good on the palate, especially for the abv. Solid sake.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1622,"2011-01-31",3.7,"I had this in a little sushi place in Anchorage with my bowl of sushi and chop sticks.  I still done have a lot of knowledge about sake.  It was served chilled, and it was still and clear.  Gentle alcohol and perfume nose.  Some plum notes with alcohol and flowery notes.  It went well with dinner.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

1622,"2009-09-13",2.5,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured no head and a clear uncarbonated body. The mouth feel was weakly vinous at the start mediumly vinous at the finish with a mild burning alcohol aftertaste in the throat. The flavor contained typical notes of typical rice wine vinous alcohol.  Rough and unrefined with a mild polished rice flavor. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1622,"2007-06-13",3.7,"375 ml bottle. Pours clear. Aroma is fruity with a hint of rice. Alcohol is quite present but other flavors, such as flowers and fruit make their way through. Palate is smooth. Much better than the normal Ozeki.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","molassesfan"
1622,"2005-05-06",3.5,"Chilled bottle.  Clear color with a slight yellowish tinge.  Aroma is fairly light, indeed fruity with maybe a touch of anise/licorice.  Alcohol is noticeable in the nose but seemingly more subdued than the jet fuel sake that I have tried in the past.  Light, fruity flavors with a pleasant alcohol presence.  Warming, alcohol flavors are present but not dominating for 16%.  Enjoyable.","Alabama, USA","11026"
1622,"2005-03-30",3.3,"This ones 16% abv and made with rice thats been polished to 50%.  Almost clear with maybe a hint of amber, depending on how the light hits it.   Aroma and taste are full of summer fruits - melon/cantaloupe.  Very smooth bodied, just a bit of alcohol warmth at the finish - that seems to go away as it warms - I think I started off with this being too cold.  Thanks to Paul for saving half a bottle for me!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
