2346,"2014-09-25",4.3,"A Ratebeer.com általi besorolást alapul véve hagytam magam meggyőzni arról, hogy egy ""belgian strong ale""-t tartok a kezemben egészen addig, míg az első kortyot követően elbizonytalanodva forgattam meg ismét a címkét némi megerősítést keresve ahhoz a sugallathoz, mely szerint ennek a sörnek a legtöbb porcikája leginkább az imperial stout-műfaj felé húz. S mivelhogy remélhetőleg a gyártók maguk hitelesebbek lehetnek e téren, én jóhiszeműen rájuk hagyatkoznék a kategorizálást illetően. Annál is inkább, mert az egyik legkülönlegesebb imperial stoutról beszélek, amit alkalmam nyílt megkóstolni pályafutásom során. Bár közepesen áttetsző, kóla színű teste ezt nem feltétlenül vetíti előre, illata egy lépéssel közelebb visz minket a Kánaánhoz. Fantasztikus, enyhén tőzegfüstös nyitányú, krémes, tejszínes, vaníliás-kókuszos, mazsolás aromák járják ezerszínű táncukat; a legszebben megkomponált whiskyk illata tárul elénk. A fenti komponensek aztán egy arcpirítóan édes, likőrös testben találnak ránk ismét; vibráló és izgalmas ízjegyek sokasága tűnik fel egy cukorközpontú, ám malátásan is telt keretben, majd gyógynövénylikőrös keserűséggel búcsúzik a kompozíció, amit az alkohol melege jár át jótékonyan. Csukott szemmel kóstolva gond nélkül vágnánk rá, hogy miféle itallal van dolgunk, a körítés azonban valóban kissé kérdésessé tesz mindenféle tipológiai iránymutatást. Ez legyen azonban a legnagyobb problémánk, ha egy ilyen főzettel akadunk össze, nálam mindenesetre előkelő helyet foglal el a tesztalanyok népes táborában.","HUNGARY","adster"

Plenty of fruity flavors involved trying to sneak in under the whiskey. This beer is powerful and is a sipper for those who have acquired the taste.

2346,"2014-05-14",1.4,"11.2oz bottle, from Party Source. Imported by Shelton Bros. Labeled 10%. This is probably the most full-to-the-top bottle I have ever seen, ever. The liquid level was actually above that ridge in the glass, just below the cap lip. Unfortunately, that didnt seem to help preserve the beer. The beer is flat as hell. Goddamnit Party Source, this is the second time you have screwed me over in one night. Something is obviously wrong the moment I pour this... Very little head, just a minimal ring of khaki head is evident moments after I pour. No lace. Head soon fades to absolutely nothing. Murky brown color, which is a little unsettling, because I thought this was going to be a stout. Not that its bad that this is a barrel-aged dark strong, its just a bit misleading. The label is a mess and hard to read, but screams ""imperial stout"" from first, second, and third glance. On the 4th glance at the label I notice a nearly illegible text under the portrait on the label that reads simply ""ale aged in bourbon barrels"". Doh, silly me, how could I have not known this was going to be a belgian dark strong ale? Flavor isnt horrible... Pretty cloying sweet, kind of yeasty though. Medium to bigger body. Flat texture. More dry finish. Along with the sweet taste, theres a big bite and heat in the finish. Flavor is a lot of caramel malt, some dark fruit, bruised mushy grapes, Light bit of smokiness, some bourbon quality. Ahh, fuck. Might be good if it wasnt just flat thick syrup. That quality makes this undrinkable. Couldnt even finish half. De Molen, Shelton, [2nd tier distributor], and Party Source... You are all guilty here. Get your shit together. If someone that was relatively new to craft beer took a gamble on this and bought it for $10, they would quit craft beer forever and resent the entire scene. Is that what you want? To ruin the industry? Why even do I keep falling for this BS? I stopped buying movie tickets after I felt ripped off for the umpteenth time...

2346,"2014-03-28",4.0,"2014.03.26 - de Molen Goths and Vandals - on tap at ChurchKey. 

This was several days ago so only general impressions.

Aroma: I am usually weak at aroma, and worse at recalling aroma, but de Molens are often pretty neutral to my nose. 7/10

Appearance: pretty appealing, about what you expect from the style. Moderately dark. 4/5

Taste: All de Molens are exceptionally smooth for the abv, and often so smooth it's hard to differentiate flavors. Suffice it to say it was yummy and I enjoyed orcas expected. 8/10

Palate: As I mentioned I find all de Molens to be exceptionally smooth. Slick mouthfeel. Hard to see room for improvement unless you really need carbonation. 5/5

Overall: another solid effort from de Molen. They clearly take pride in their effort since they typically remind you that you can age most if their stuff for up to 25 years. 16/20","Martinsburg, West Virginia, USA","mnoud"
