780,"2014-12-02",3.8,"Bottle at Nagano Sake Village into a stem glass. Thanks TimE for the rec! Hazy dark brown with tan head. Aromas of caramel, dark fruit, light chocolate. Tastes of caramel, dark fruit, sweet malt. Medium body with a dry finish. Nicely done.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
780,"2013-12-05",3.6,"Bottle - Wheat, smoke and toasted malts. Jet brown with a tiny brown head. Smoke, raisin and dark fruit. Sweet but nice.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
780,"2013-11-27",3.5,"33 cl bottle @ home, from IP trade with TimE - thanks! Label says 6% btw. Very dark brown color. Short beige head with good retention. Aromas: some roasted malts, drop/licorice, fruit confit, slightly sour, just a hint of banana. Retronasal theres a bit of the sourness of the wheat. Flavor is light to moderate sweet, roasted malt. Body is rather full. Flavor lingers. Maybe it got too old, but its not very true to the style. Pleasant enough though.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","PotjeBier"
780,"2013-10-08",3.5,"Cherry aroma, red fruit, roasted malt. Plum juice, biscuit, sour finish. Nice creamy and fruity Dunkel.","","biirusaikou"
780,"2013-09-23",3.6,"On tap at Ibaraki Bakuon 2013. A cola pour with a beige head. A good mix of weizen & Dunkel with the spiciness & hint of caramel-quite good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
780,"2013-09-06",4.1,"Draught. Aroma of sweet fruits, raisins, dark chocolate. Not fantastic to look at, but the flavours and balance of this were sensational. Rich and creamy. Fantastic depth. Loved it.","Kyoto, JAPAN","Westkyoto77"
780,"2013-04-28",3.9,"Bottle at Shinshu Sake Mura. Dark brown colour, big golden creamy head. Aroma bubblegum, banana, soy sauce. Taste is roasty, wheaty, bit of creaminess. Quite different. Pretty nice.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
780,"2013-04-02",3.2,"Not too weizen like - some raisin, a bit of banana, bready and soft grassy/floral hops. Different but a bit non descript.","JAPAN","jonno"
780,"2013-04-01",3.5,"Bottle at Shinshu Osake Mura. Black colour with a small beige head. Faint aroma of vinegar, banana. Flavour of banana, licorice.","Huddinge, SWEDEN","AndySnow"
780,"2009-12-22",3.5,"Bottle. Pours muddy brown with a creamy beige head. The aroma is spot on. A pleasant spicyness with underlying caramel, chocolate, wheat and banana. At no point is the spice to intense. Its well crafted and the nuances really compliment the overall balance. I really enjoyed this.

780,"2009-12-20",3.3,"I get the feeling the bottled version doesnt capture the magic of the draught. The bottle we had seemed solid but was let down by an over-fizzy palate - perhaps because it was straight off a plane from Japan. Ive given my palate rating the benefit of the doubt on that basis. Certainly a good-looking dunkel with the sort of head retention youd expect. Sweet and wheaty under the nose but a little indistinct. As sweet as the rest of the range sampled, with plenty of molasses, toffee and mashed bananas before a sour finish. (Ratebeer Sydney Xmas gathering under the harbour bridge, 2009.

780,"2009-07-22",3.5,"Very dark in color with little head.  Rich malts, but lacking much wheat aroma or flavor.  Some dark fruits, and light banana.  Oily, smooth body,  A good brew, but would like a little more weizen in this dunkel.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
780,"2009-06-01",4.0,"Draught at Towers, Tokyo.  Cloudy nut brown. Toasty with licorice and banana . Dry, even crisp thoug hsparkling, with light-medium body. Wonderful balance between licorice and banana, lovely depth in flavour and a welcome twist of the style. The worlds best dunkelweizen?","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
780,"2009-04-14",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2012 Bottle. Dark, rich malts, but with less wheat flavor than expected. Much more like a Munich dunkel, but with a bit of wheat flavor added. Rich, complex malts, though. And decently balanced. Tasty and different.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
780,"2007-07-26",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Plump earthiness and plum fruitiness slide along this Dunkelweizens juicy banana esters. This rich and unique recipe of Minamishinsyus might be their finest libation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A frothy head of foam protects the murky dark brown.
-Clovey phenols are well integrated and, fitting with the sweet earthiness, add complexity.
-Dark chocolate is even perceived alongside the finishing earthiness and roastiness.
-This is not your typical Dunkelweizen with its focus on wheat and caramel malts, but rather a bona fide Dunkel (or black lager) which happens to use a weizen yeast. A nice twist to say the least!

On tap at the brewery restaurant.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
780,"2007-06-25",4.0,"Dark brown color, caramel, cloves, bananas, milk chocolate earthy nose. The mouth reminded me of a Banana Sunday from Dairy Queen, but not as sweet. Drinking this beert gave me the same happy feeling I had when I had a Sundae when I was a kid. Perhaps they should market this as a semi-sweet liquid Banana Sunday. I would go for it.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
