4390,"2012-01-18",3.7,"Draft on tap at the brewpub (Munster, IN). Is it a sign of a maturing beer palate that I was most excited for this on my visit or that Im lame? Pours a rich blackish hue, pretty dark, but not opaque. Some ruby brown edges and flashes in the body (at least in the brewpub light). A big cakey light brown head sits atop, like chocolate milk, bubbly and thick with staying power. A good layer remains after awhile and laces pretty well. Gorgeous. Aromas are cocoa and biscuits, touches of sweeter toffee, gentle roastiness. A sizable load of sweeter chocolate, some pretzels, more biscuits, a creamy sweetness gives some shout outs in the experience. Simple but pleasant. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a bit lighter with lots of chocolate, biscuits, and gentle roast up front. Toastiness is more of the speciality here, matching with sweeter chocolate, biscuits, and some faint wafts of dark fruit into the backend. Anise shows up lightly, not enough to scar my ""Anise Hating Palate"". Lots of milk chocolate though, yet not too sweet. A lighter body somehow. Creamy body makes a silky experience, easily drinkable for me. Touches of more roast, faint ash more like roasty coffee into the middle and finish. Still creamy, sweeter, some brown malt essence almost works its way in in the middle. Very nice, a touch sweeter than the Black Wolf, but damn good. Finish is lingering dry and roast, cocoa, and some soda bread. Faint coffee essence, but not much, a very approachable yet top notch American version of a Schwarz. Well done, guys. Itd be a stretch to say I like this more than Cimmerian.. But I think it suited my mood much better this evening.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
