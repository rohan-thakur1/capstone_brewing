3291,"2015-02-15",4.2,"on tap at the brewery, a quick schnitt as we couldnt find a parking spot. massive head made up more than half of the glass, something ive allways liked from way back when i started drinking czech beers and it would often take barmen 5 minutes to pull a beer. anyways, lightly hazed golden with a faint greenish tinge; aroma of weeds, moss, crushed pistachio; decent whack of bitterness, rusty drainpipe, old well, grass heap. fresh, well-kept, bursting with flavour. will have to return for a proper session shortly","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"

3291,"2014-12-05",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2014 (Bue au keller de Lieberth): Un nectar spectaculairement moelleux autant visuellement quen bouche. Une présence lactée éclaircit les saveurs de céréales et de houblons herbacés, très machable et sufig à la fois avec une amertume assumée. Un liquide mémorable à la buvabilité divine.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
3291,"2014-10-17",4.7,"Gravity pour at the Keller. Aroma is enticing, yet simple: lemony, grain and barnyard funk. Taste is huge lemon, grain and a substantive hoppy bitterness (both citrus and pine). Perfect palate, light bodied and low carbonation. Awesome keller, among the very bests. Probably my favourite keller, along with Witzgall and Roppelts.","Quebec, CANADA","Luk_"

3291,"2013-08-10",3.0,"Draught @ Lieberth Keller, Kreuzberg. Krug. Pours amber with a creamy head. Grass, grain and caramel. A whiff of toffee. Medium bodied. Hoppy finish. Quite dull and overall a disappointment. I had a mass Roppelt Kellerbier before this - I guess all Kellerbiers will fail after that though. Pretty average thing!","Odense, DENMARK","Dedollewaitor"
3291,"2013-08-04",3.9,"From the barrel at the Lieberth keller in Hallerndorf, 21/7/2013. Served in a krug, but it looked golden in colour with a decent and frothy white head. Easy drinking beer, with an aroma of crisp malts, grassy hops and a hint of citrus blossom. Flavour had some solid, bready malts, a touch of sweetish fruit and a gentle finish. Excellent.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","downender"
3291,"2013-07-30",3.1,"At the Keller, in a Krug. Small white head. Malty aroma with a fruity note. Quite swet, malty and rather yeasty flavour.","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"
3291,"2013-05-25",3.2,"On tap at Kreuzberg LieberthKeller, Hallerndorf.  Malty aroma, okish in mouth, not much of a finish.  Actually its hoppier than I first thought.  Some drinkability and it grew on me.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
3291,"2013-05-22",3.1,"Draft at the keller.  Head is mostly lasting. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, husks), lightly to moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), with a light note of concrete. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.  Better than the pils, but still rather plain and a bit rough/muddled.  As with the pils, it just sorta comes off as rushed and unfocused.  The Witzgall and Roppelt samples were in strikingly better condition, not even close.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3291,"2013-04-07",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2013 Multiple liters during a 4+ hour session at Lieberth in Hallerndorf, Nov 2012: Lightly hazed lemon. Natural-looking foamy and sticky head. Perfumey, squeaky-clean aromas of candyish, pistachio-tinged yeast, rich melanoidin character, candied fennel seed, mineral, and a dab of sweet ripe melon. Naturally soft and snug effervescence. Full, mouth-filling starchy malt merges with a stiffly mineralic body and oodles of vibrant toasted cracker, with doughy heft and all. Masterfully structured and meticulously detailed malt character. Honey-kissed juices virtually drip from the Viennas permeant succulence. Minerals and the faintest edge of toasted baguette perfectly contrast with the profoundly nuanced juicy hops which strike a sweet harmony with the softness of the water. Rustic yeastiness exudes here and there, adding another layer of intrigue. Hops are utterly dripping with sumptuous oils and sweetish nectars which gorgeously offset the sizzling acids. Full-on melanoidin lemon cakeyness suffuses a well-polished lemon hop twist, peppered melon, and brighter shades of lemon candy. Yet another burst of nectar-laden hops emerges and dovetails alongside a captivatingly clean, deep, and textural malt expression in the finish. A deceptively simple lagerbier of breathtaking purity and scrupulous attention to detail. One of the funnest beers I have tasted in a very long time. As a side note: I suspect this beer translates more favorably at the brewery compared to the keller, due to extended  lagering time. 
Well, evidently during keller season this doesnt come close to rivaling the stunning beauty we experienced during our previous visit (when the kellers are closed and people are consuming less of this, i.e. has more time to lager).   This particular batch was lagered for four weeks as compared to longer periods during colder months (eight weeks when we visited in November). Was still quite nice, but in the mid-3s instead of mid-4 territory.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3291,"2013-01-22",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2013 draft at Lieberth in Hallerndorf. incredibly deep and rich nose of spicy, pungent spalt hops with a superbly clean pilsner malt honey sweetness, its both brilliantly spicy and magically juicy, cracker-y and dough-y with perfectly soft carbonation and a soft, creamy mouthfeel from two-stage decoction mashing. balanced between sweet and bitter at the exact perfect spot, with soft, velvety carbonation, fruit spice edel hops, soft malt texture and a rich rustic-ness provided by the yeast.  a superb lager, legit mid-4 raised to 5.0 because its a personal favorite experience from November 2012, but in May 2013 the batch was grainy, simpler, less juicy and much less soft. so, at one point this was a 4.5 for me, but less than a year later this is probably a 3.6.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3291,"2012-09-05",3.9,"From the barrel. Poured into a ceramic mug with a sticky white head. Soft pale malts, earthy and woody, with lighter floral hoppy notes. Sweeter grainy notes come out as it warms up a bit. Very refreshing and simply delicious.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"

3291,"2009-08-07",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2009 Draft @ Lieberth-keller, Kreutzberg. In krug, is dark golden with nice scant lacing.

3291,"2006-05-23",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2014 Impressions in the shade of the keller:
-There is barely any head atop the krug. Not that it matters anyway for a Kellerbier.
-Aroma is nicely earthy, a quilt built of leaves and citrus.
-Body is as easygoing as can be, seguing into a softly bitter finish, hoppy and wet.
-Mild herbal, tea-like hoppiness reappear aside milky connotations.
-The very low carbonation makes the drinkability sky high.
-Finally, in 2014, I think I got to taste what the Lieberth Kellerbier is supposed to be. My first experience in 2006 must have been the bottom of a keg, or a simply poorly tendered batch. Alls forgiven, especially if I can get more of this divine brew! ;)
