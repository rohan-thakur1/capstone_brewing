559,"2016-11-25",4.1,"Bomber from the brewery. Aged another two years. Pours a deep, hazy copper with almost no head. Aroma is a little funky, yeasty, and extremely ripe dark fruit and bananas. Bourbon in the forefront, caramel, overripe bananas, dried apricot, cheese. Lighter body, clean finish. A little flat, maybe from the aging.","","OsuStu"
559,"2015-02-13",4.0,"Tap at Capitol Beer in Sacramento, CA. Pours very dark brown with a beige head. Aroma suggests bourbon and maybe treacle. Med + body. Flavor? I call bourbon and treacle. Its flirting with brown sugar and stickiness, but never really gets there. Would love to also get this is rum and calvados versions. Tasty stuff. Bourbon is just right.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
559,"2015-02-12",3.8,"On tap at Capitol Beer & Tap Room. Pours Dark brown with a modest beige head and a light malty aroma. Thereis a hearty dark malt, dark fruit flavor with lots of whiskey. A nice sipper.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
559,"2014-07-15",3.8,"Pour from a bottle at the Rockmill tasting room. Looks like the regular dubbel; amber brown with a smaller beige head that leaves some spots of lace in the glass. Notes of vanilla, dark fruits (figs, dates, raisins), mellow spice, earth, nuts, cake, oak, and warming bourbon throughout. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, warming mouthfeel. Not as clean as the regular one, as expected, but a nice barrel treatment that improves upon it. Well done.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
559,"2014-06-08",4.0,"Bottle pour at the source. Pours a murky copper with a white head of foam that dissipates quickly. The aroma is heavy on the whiskey, but still has the toffee and dark fruit notes I like in the base beer. Taste is boozy and sweet. Very low carbonation. Really, its just enough to give it a little tingle on the tongue. Pretty good stuff, but I think the taster I had was enough for me.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
559,"2014-03-20",4.0,"Sample at World of Beer Easton on 3/15/14. Hazy amber to brown in color with a medium off-white head. Aroma of malt, caramel, bourbon and dates. Malty and bourbony flavor with caramel and dark fruit before a semi dry finish. Nice.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
559,"2013-10-18",4.2,"On tap at Dutchs. Pours a totally hazy brown / red color. Big pillowy khaki head, leaves great, thick lace. An excellent looking beer. Awesome aroma in the nose... Good vanilla, some dark fruit. Excellent vanilla, bourbon in the flavor. Nice light spice. Light bit of warmth, but no alcohol bite or burn. Some nice caramel, butterscotch. Very rich and dessert-like. Great moderate sweet taste, light bitter, and the perfect amount of light alcohol warmth. Bigger body. Smooth, creamy, kind of silky texture. Slightly sticky in the in the finish. Light carbonation. Awesome beer. Probably the best barrel-aged dubbel Ive ever had, very good. Much better than expected. Very enjoyable stuff. Each sip leaves a very long rich vanilla lightly fruity complex aftertaste to savor, it goes a long way.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
559,"2013-10-18",4.0,"Draft to taster at Dutchs. Looks good for the style; a cloudy amberish brown with light beige head that dissipates into lacing. It may be getting to the end of the keg, but that doesnt bother me any. Smells good too; bourbon-forward with notes of dark fruit and Belgian yeast. Tastes like it smells with a good mouthfeel. Good beer; much better than the Cask Aged Tripel IMO.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
559,"2013-10-15",4.1,"Tasted from draft. Pours a dark brown with beige head. In light with some amber color. Great lacing. Strong aroma of caramel and bourbon. Taste is a robust caramel malt with sweet bourbon. Not a very over powering bourbon. Some bourbon barrel aged beers seem to be overpowered by the bourbon but this dubbel really keeps its sweet caramel and toffee flavor. Well balanced medium bodied beer. Pretty tasty.

559,"2013-08-02",3.9,"Sample at 1808 American Bistro. Pours a slightly hazy dark orange color with a medium thin white head that diminishes quickly to a sparse outer ring. Nil lacing. Bourbon and vanilla in the nose. Full-bodied with flavors of oaky vanilla, bourbon and caramel malt. The finish is boozy with a bourbon and earthy malt aftertaste. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
