Most noticeable was the big yogurt vapour and cheesy taste that when paired with the hibiscus drowns out almost all of the fruit flavors and there was not a lot of tartness to counteract. In fact the bit of fruit I did get was sweet strawberry jam that seemed out of place too. I drank a lot of great beer on this day, so having one or two bomb is not so bad.

3931,"2014-04-12",4.0,"Draught at the brewery, 4/10/14Lovely pour. Raspberry-red with some lighter orange/pink hues. Light haze to it, but not cloudy. Off-white, red tinged head is moderately sized but recedes quickly.Fresh strawberry juice and tart lactic and brett acids in the nose are softened on the end by wheat, very light vanilla-like sweetness and a touch of lemon-tinted sugar. With warming, tons of complexities emerge. The acid mixes with the hibiscus and wood to give an almost red wine-like note, while more lactic acid mixes with the strawberry to give a light strawberry yohgurt-like note. No alcohol or flaws. Like the jojo, I think the hibiscus is not much of an aroma-enhancer in beer. Its rather dry, nutty, earthy and just strange. But it certainly gives quite the color.The flavor is shockingly reserved on the fruit. I would never guess there was kiwi in this and even strawberry is difficult to pinpoint. Some hibiscus-like dryness/earthiness and tons of soft, well-developed lactic acid that gives plenty of tartness. Wheat leaves a soft, supple texture and the body is light and well-carbonated.I expected a lot from this one, and it delivered. What I didnt expect was much of a traditional Berliner Weisse. Thought it was going to be extremely full-on brett and tons of fruit flavor. Nope. Very light, perfectly attenuated and full of wheat and lactic acid. Higher in abv than a traditional berliner, but thats one of the few characteristics that it departs from. And you certainly dont feel the extra alcohol. Wonderful, refreshing, tart wheat beer. Just as it should be.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3931,"2013-12-10",4.0,"750ml bottle courtesy of a trade on BA. Thanks, dude. Excited to pop the 2nd of their main Berliners. Pours a nice ruby red hue, orange and gentle haziness shows artic sunset glow, reddish orange, grapefruit color with lively carbonation, decent haze, striking glow and hues. A frothy whitish head atop stays as a decent filmy layer, good stick around and size that seems to last. Aromas are potently sour, nice hibiscus tart florals off the bat meet a distinct seedy strawberry, yogurt and tart lemony lactic life strike, covered up a bit by that hibiscus and strawberry. Gentle kiwi is more citrusy, blends in with dry straw, crakced wheat, more tart and strawberry, a bit seedy, a touch rubbery, nice sourness. Initial is firmly tart, seedy sweet and sour strawberries hit quickly, melding into a fruity and hibiscus floral tartness. Quickly more sourness, that strawberry really lasts. Earthy and tart hibiscus meet some firm lactic sourness, yogurty and lemony, some nice citric life tails into more yogurt, bready malts, some sweet jabs of fruit into the middle. The strawberry really goes in and out, offering sweet and tart. The kiwi a bit salty and more distinguishable into the middle and backend. A touch rubbery, sour and tart (but certainly not in a league with Somer Weisse), some bready malts, firm yogurty elements as we trail out, lingering lactic presence, tartness, a bit of straw and strawberry, gentle bread. Solid stuff. An assertive wonderfully sour and complex nose showing all the elements, gorgeous pour lead up to a nice front end offering some nice complexity from the additions, trailing out a bit more flat, with some acidic jabs that are nice but a bit more muted. Lacking some of the intensity I saw in Somer (but its still got some sour zip), but that likely makes it more approachable and the better more balanced of the two. Strawberry and hibiscus really work well up front, synergistic with some nice sourness into the backend that develops as we move further into the bottle. Lovely stuff. Perhaps a touch undercarbed and not as sour as Id personally like, but Id imagine that makes it a very good beer.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3931,"2013-11-30",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Strawberry compote, kiwi and flowers whirl within this Sour Ales dry, effervescent mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the hazy pale blond.
-The sourness levels are moderate enough to increase drinkability.
-This is yet another Night Shift brew which brings lots of delightful options for food pairings.
-Light rubbery phenolics are perceived in the aroma.

Picking up some wheat grain with a medium body hiding beneath all the fruit. Medium carbonation, sits well on the palate very well unlocking the a nice malted body with almost no bitterness. The finish is very characteristic of the style, with the flavor opening up to the bready-biscuit like aftertaste.
