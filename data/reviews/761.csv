761,"2014-11-07",3.3,"Growler from brewery. Hazy brown with off white head. Malty nose, a hint of spice. Weiss spice in flavor, toasted malt, crisp. Nice flavor","Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, USA","BiddleBrau"
761,"2014-10-12",3.2,"Pours an opaque amber with a medium off white head. Aroma has light spicy notes...very earthy almost woody...a mild caramel sweetness. Flavor follows suit adding mild fruitiness and a nougat/nutty no the that comes across as chalky/inauthentic. Mouthfeel is medium and the finish is fruity/spicy lingering to earthy/chalky","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
761,"2014-02-16",3.3,"Sampled at Big Brew Beer Festival (Morristown). Pours a hazy dark amber color with a small off white head of foam. Aroma of mainly light citrus and roasted malt. Taste mimics the nose. Nothing outstanding","Forked River, New Jersey, USA","Ed5388"
761,"2014-01-14",3.8,"This one poured a medium to lighter brown color with a beige head. Aroma was of wheat, light toast, nuts, and grassy hops. Flavor was simlar, incredibly balanced mixed of a hefe and dunkel. Another great Lager by victory.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
761,"2014-01-11",3.8,"Tap. Pours a clear light brown body under a small fizzy off-white head. The nose is husky and earthy wheat with some over-ripe banana esters. The flavor is very fruity, lots of banana, some clove, bready malt, nice pervasive yeastiness. A little sweet up front, but dries out nicely towards the finish. Great easy drinking Dunkelweizen. Light to medium bodied with just the right amount of soft carbonation.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
761,"2014-01-10",3.8,"On tap at Harris grill. This beer blew me away. I usually don't like this style at all but Victory really nailed this one. Slightly fruity slightly nutty aroma. The taste is light with a slight nutty finish. Medium carb. Just a really easy drinking beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
761,"2013-12-22",3.2,"Murky amber, high effervescence with thin oily top, lightest white ring. Rye grains and banana nose, softer than hoped. Bitingly spicy flavor is dark, husky malt, awesomely balanced, bit of undesired chocolate sweetness growing mid with warmth, lingering until the metallic, zesty-carbed end.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
761,"2013-12-18",3.5,"Tap at Victory Downington, 27/11/13.
Hazed chestnut brown with a moderate light beige covering that retains well.
Nose is yeast, toffee, banana, light spice, clove - classic dunkelweizen aroma.
Taste comprises banoffee pie, vanilla, malt, light nana, clove.
Medium bodied, soft carbonation, smooth on the palate, drying finale with underlying fruit and spice.
Nice.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
761,"2013-12-14",3.2,"Draft from Downingtown. Good bold character dunkel. Malt and banana and spices. Balanced but not too exciting. Average.","West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA","60minuteman"
761,"2013-11-10",2.7,"Nice-looking beer, especially in a tall beer glass. But tasted unexpectedly bland, maybe even frightened. Ive had better dunkels.","","edwardjay"
761,"2013-11-08",3.5,"Amber colored body, medium sized off-white head, soapy lacing. Banana, light toasted bread, biscuit, hints of chocolate, caramel, and clove. Medium bodied, smooth carbonation, lingering slightly sweet finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

761,"2012-03-11",4.3,"Draft at Sugar Maple.  Hazy unfiltered golden tan.  Lighter than I wouldve expected in color.  Super fresh banana clove aroma.  Yeasty, smooth, world class.  Banana...wow.  Awesome.  A touch of citrus balance.  Excellent.  Barely dunkelfied, just a hint of chocolate.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

761,"2008-03-15",3.0,"Darker brown-amber with a medium head.  Aroma has some graininess, roast, and light wheat.  Flavor has a heavy malt profile with some wheat, light roast.  OK, but not a great representation of the style IMHO and nowhere near as good as the Moonglow W-Bock.  Given its high rating, maybe a weak batch?","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
761,"2007-12-28",3.7,"hazy dark golden appearance with nice white head.  flavor is a great example of the style with an initial nice maltiness that finishes with the classic sweet smoothness of a wheat beer.  i wouldnt say the beer is amazing, but just a very flavorful brew","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","joshwilfong"
761,"2007-09-24",2.9,"Dark brown with a huge whipped cream head.  Light grapey aroma.  Taste is of slightly fermented garbage diluted with sparkling cherry water. Tap @ Tria 16oz/$2.50","portland, Oregon, USA","Arayaga2"
761,"2007-09-23",3.3,"draft @ BSP.  Pours a deep brown with slightly off-head.  Massive aroma of bananas, clove, somewhat thin on the palate, not much flavor to back up the aroma, some hazelnut, mostly fizzy, an ok dunkel.","USA","ElGaucho56"
761,"2007-09-22",3.8,"Tap at Blind Tiger: Pours a murky, purple-ish brown with a deep khaki head. Aroma has some chocolate, lots of banana, fig, and cinnamon. Has a full mouth feel. There are roasty flavors upfront that go well with a slightly sharp wheat malt hint. Has hints of raspberries, peat and a hint of smoke in the finish. A fairly well made Dunkelweizen.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
761,"2007-09-22",3.1,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Murky amber/brown beer.  Aroma of licorice and clove.  Light banana and a hint of smoky phenols.  Light fruitiness and a nice toasted wheat aroma as well.  Medium bodied and the flavour really doesnt deliver on the aroma, a bit watery with light chocolate and a bit of molasses.  Meh.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
761,"2007-09-20",3.2,"Tap at Blind Tiger. Another disappointment. I almost wonder if the lines were screwed up, or the van got baked in the sun, but BT is such a premier bar and Ive never had any issue with QC at all, so I doubt it. Chocolately aroma, lightly malty, peanuty. Milky and dry, oats, with a lactic flavor that I noticed in all 3 beers I had that night. Kind of off-putting and screwy.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
761,"2007-09-19",4.0,"Tap @ Blind Tiger.  Pours a deep, cloudy brown color with a tan/light brown head.  Aroma is clove, chocolate, and malt notes, with slight bready characteristics.  Taste is largely chocolate with a nice bread and spice characteristic toward the end, with noticeable roasted almonds.  This immediately became one of the best dunkelweizens I have ever tried, if not the best.  Great beer.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
761,"2007-09-16",3.8,"On tap at Tria, pours dark amner/brown with a good amount of off-white head.  Nice strong almost abbey ale flavor, with a good strong finish.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","jeremytoni"
761,"2007-09-11",4.0,"On tap at the Victory brew pub. Pours a deep brown with some amber highlights and a medium bubbly/creamy light tan head that laced.  Aroma of toasted malts, some banana, some malty sweetness, also getting some hints of clove.  Flavor of rich toasted malts, ripe banana, some caramel, clove, roasted almonds and some malt sweetness.  Well done Dunkelwiezen.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
761,"2007-08-26",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2007 A fine brew, handds down.  Perfect for semi-hot days in Sept., a great dark wheat beer, nice subtlte wheat and beautiful mild creaminess in the mouthfeel, cheers to Victory!","http://westchesterbeer.com, USA","DeadGuyFrank"
761,"2007-08-23",3.9,"As nice as a dark wheat can be.  Beautiful reddish brown, hazy body with a huge, firm, hang-over-the sides head.  Malt, yeast, citrus nose.  Taste of malts, caramel, banana and spice, and more hops than I would have expected.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
761,"2005-10-16",4.1,"I look forward to this every year. Its cloudy, dark reddish, fruity and smooth. Everything is in balance here, and exactly what a dunkelweizen should be.

761,"2004-09-26",4.1,"Awesome dunkle, cloudy appearance, deep copper color, very little head though, lots of clove & banana notes all over the place, also a little hint of a toasty caramel flavor, refreshing & smooth, could have drank this beer all night","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
761,"2004-09-21",3.8,"Had this on tap at Victory.  Really good dunkleweizen, which is one of my favorite styles.  More importantly, we headed down to Philly afterward to see the Monday Nighter  - Eags/Vikes.  Fantastic game, McNabb is really something else.  They had 3 weiss beers on tap.  Very good choice here, definitely try it if you get the chance.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","biznizness"
761,"2004-09-08",3.8,"Draught @ Victory:  This beer is a cloudy coppery color.  There was no head to it at all.    The aroma has notes of banana, cloves and some other fruits.  The taste is somewhat malty sweet with hints of the banana, cloves again.  Also some nuttiness and a bit yeasty.  Very Good!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
761,"2004-08-31",3.6,"On Tap.....Cloudy as is typical of a wheat beer, but is darker than the normal wheat, hence the name. Anyway it had a slightly fruity aroma and taste with notable wheat malt taste and notes of yeast and citrus. Not a bad brew at all!","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"
761,"2004-08-30",3.1,"Tap at Victory.  Cloudy light brown color with almost no head.  Seemed slightly too flat for the style.  Aroma was banana, mixed with the usual clove spiciness and some vanilla mixed in.  Flavor is sweet and malty and backed up with a slight hint of hops and bitterness in the end.  Smooth and drinkable but could be a lot better.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
761,"2004-08-24",4.1,"Had this for the first time on draft last night.  Pours turbid dark straw/amber, with medium white head.  Aroma of malt, yeast, fruit, and hops.  Tastes malty, yeasty, with a nice dark fruit hit at mid-palate, and more fruit, spice, hops, citrus, and caramel at the finish.  The palate was medium and very smooth.  Great lacing.  Great balance and complexity, and very true to style.  Just a great beer!","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
761,"2004-08-16",3.8,"Soft caramel rye bread yeastiness rising to my nose and a warm finish.  Good color, not too dark.  Effervescent.  Great balance between dark malt notes and wheat tang.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
761,"2004-08-08",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2007 Poured a cloudy brown color with a small off white head and very light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of light citrus and sweet banana was a stretch here.  Taste was full of caramel malt though balanced by bitter citrus, predominantly lemon and some wheat as well.  A biting carbonation took place in my mouth.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
761,"2004-08-08",4.1,"Cloudy, dark amber appearance with an average sized head.  The caramel malt aroma was complimented with notes of soft fruit and spices.

761,"2003-08-15",3.8,"An enjoyable dunkel - not as spicy and herbed flavors as others that I've had. Definate phenolic tastes mixed in with a very prominent grainy malty flavor. Nice fresh hop spiciness","Oreland, Pennsylvania, USA","chronictonic"
761,"2002-07-10",4.3,"freshness matters nothing like hefe beers from the source no annoying flavors from sitting and the yeast continuing to work and give the beer those nasty over fermented flavors when you see the bottles for the first time that is when you should buy this stuff not in the fall","PROSPECT PARK, Pennsylvania, USA","RAUCHFEST"

761,"2001-08-11",4.2,"The only pleasant experience during my visit to the Victory brewery. Lush brown color, cloudy and opaque, with a thick, white head.  Aroma reminiscent of apples and banana-bread, with a taste to match, although much subtler in the latter.  Slightly sweet with a soft bitterness in the finish.  Yummy.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
761,"2000-10-15",4.4,"Yeasty, grainy, quite a big nose on this beer. Fair hop spicyness at the finish. Caramel, roasty richness subtle flavors that make it very unique in its flavor.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
