2356,"2015-12-26",4.0,"Poured from a bottle, from Old Line Fine Wine, Spirits & Bistro. Appearance is a light reddish brown color with a half inch light tan head. Aroma is grassy, earthy hop aroma with a heavy malt presence. Taste is bitterness to start things out, and then toasty, and slightly sweet malt comes in. Palate is a hop bite with medium carbonation. Overall, nicely balanced and very good representation from Maine.","Maryland, USA","BierMeHoos"
2356,"2015-11-17",4.0,"Pours a dark ruby red/chestnut brown color with copper colored edges and a frothy, two finger yellowish-beige head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting cap. Good retention, possibly too much so, with signs of over carbonation. The pillowy foam head takes forever to settle and coated the glass with soapy lacing on the way down. 

Dank, floral aroma with a prominent earthy hop presence thats countered by a sweet malt backbone. Earthy and spicy with resinous oils, grassy pine, spruce tip and fresh buds followed by subtle tropical fruit and malt sweetness. Theres a touch of grapefruit and citrus zest along with caramel malt, toffee, biscuit and vinous fruit. Theres a stronger malt presence than I usually prefer in hoppy beers but it works really well in the nose of this beer. 

Full bodied with a blast of dry, earthy hop bitterness that lingers over the sweet malt backbone into a bone dry finish. Sticky with resinous hop oils, subtle spiciness, grassy pine and earthy, soil-like flavor. Good hop flavor but not as complex as the nose suggests. A bit one dimensional and lacking the citrus/tropical fruit sweetness found in the aroma. Fortunately, there is plenty of flavorful malt sweetness filling this need and balancing things out nicely. Strong caramel malt presence with hints of toffee, biscuit, toast and subtle dark fruit sweetness. Really well balanced and easy to drink with no heat whatsoever. The malt backbone perfectly counters the dry bitterness of the earthy, floral hops. Similar to Zoe but more flavorful and better balanced in my opinion. I could drink several of these in one sitting.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

2356,"2015-06-19",3.7,"On the side of the bottle reads ""042815.""
This was poured into a nonic pint glass.
The appearance was a two finger white foamy rocky head that dissipated in about a minute and a half. Light stringy lacing sticks in a semi-thick sort of fashion.
The smell starts off with a citrus zest with the citrus rind running over top of a light caramel presence. Its there for the style but doesnt show a whole lot of depth.
The taste is mainly bitter through the citrus zest and rind. Sweet is only there to balance in the caramel, but even that isnt exactly balanced once again. Bitter citrus aftertaste that leads into a sliding bitter citrus finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation packs enough sharpness but still allows the bitterness to display most of the sharpness.
Overall, for an American Red/Amber ale, this one is a bit more hoppier than others. Might not necessarily be a session beer, but more likely one just to enjoy as is.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2356,"2015-04-14",2.7,"Draught at Meadhall, 4/9/15Clear auburn-magenta colored body looks very appealing, topped by a beige head that is well-retained.Pine, iced tea, candied oranges, white grapefruit and wintergreen in the nose all speak to the specialty malts (must be crystal...and yes, I see that is the case looking at the commercial description) mixing with the aggressive citrus and pine of the columbus hops. A bit of odd buttercream-like note with warming, which I dont think is diacetyl but rather some odd aromatic from one of the malts. No alcohol in the nose.Bitter up front; very much so. Resin and dry grapefruit/orange rind immediately assert themselves while the classic this-is-why-you-shouldnt-put-crystal-malts-in-an-I Pale ale effect is immediately felt; that being an iced tea-like flavor with a very hard, (think hard candy texture, like a jolly rancher) texture to the beer and some toasted malt dryness with a complete lack of balancing sweetness. Ive been pretty outspoken on not putting crystal malts in an ipa and for that matter, may as well leave out most of the other specialty malts too. Throw in a bit of debittered black malt if you want the color and maybe just a touch of special B if you really want your hop-focused beer to have some weird malt notes that dont work with the hop flavors....Anyways, back to the beer. Its massively bitter with no balancing malt sweetness or even a soft texture for the hops to sink in to. As is, it just assaults the palate and the acidity builds up on the finish. Furthermore, despite having amarillo in the hop bill, there seems to be only a passing fruitiness from it that is easily outclassed by the bully that is columbus. While falconers flight has a lot of enjoyable hops in it (simcoe and sorachi ace are awesome), its still very high in alpha acids and seems to be abused here, leading to more detrimental acidity and unbalance. In summary, I did not like this beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2356,"2015-03-03",4.2,"Not too many breweries make a truly red ale. They tend to be classified as an amber ales or Red IPA or American Strong Ale. But with Red Wheelbarrow, Maine Beer Company has succeeded in making a beer thats neither of those styles and is more of its own thing. Plenty hoppy to be sure, but not extremely so. The palette is pretty well balanced for the most part and its drinker-friendly. If only it werent so expensive.

I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 11/25/14 and cost $7.99 ($0.47 per ounce).

Appearance: Deep shade of burgundy/blood red. Very cloudy body. Pours to a large, tan, foamy head that laces and retains extremely well.

Smell: Fruity scent of berries and citrus; some flowers.

Taste: Berry isnt a flavor you tend to get in beers that arent made with some kind of fruit extract or puree. I do detect a slight strawberry or raspberry quality to this beer, though. Ill chalk that up to the fairly odd combination of Columbus, Amarillo, and Falconers Flight hops. Orange seems to be quite prominent as well. Theres a fairly strong malty presence here; creating for distinct sweetness and minor bready flavor (maybe even some fruitcake). It finishes with an overtly bitter sensation, its dry but washes away clean. Its more than just a solid brew, but not quite to the point of being amazing. Definitely one of the best red ales I can recall having, though.

Drinkability: At 7% ABV, Red Wheelbarrow is a strong beer in the classic sense, but surprisingly light in delivery. The mouthfeel is full, soft, well-carbonated and comfortable. Not refreshing, but in no way a challenge to get down. The alcohol is barely noticeable, though I appreciate the robustness of the palette. Versatile enough to stand up to a meal, but tasty enough to enjoy a single bottle by itself.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish.

2356,"2015-01-18",3.9,"A crack of the cap and a hop-fruity aroma wafts towards me, the ruby-brown fluid fills my glass to about halfway and then up comes the head, thick, wet and gleaming, easily taking over half the glass. The scent is heady, making me think of dark fruits for decadent pie fillings. The foam recedes, and I finish pouring the glass, take the picture and bring the glass to my lips for a first taste. Hops are very apparent in the flavor, but the malty fruit accents are predominant and seem to lean towards a roasted nutty taste as it warms. As tasty a beer as I have in a while, this has excellent flavors, and a gloriously balanced bitterness is keeping me interested in every sip. Boredom comes easy if a beer isnt welcoming me with all its qualities, but this one has my attention! I taste the bitterness in the back of my throat, thick and rich...very exciting.
The medium body is sticky and a little thick, the carbonation is perfect for carrying over the flavors and texture of this brew. The finish is nice; it stays a little, and then says goodbye with a smile and a nod and although it is big while its here, its finish is short and sweet and the physical experience is gone in minutes.

The caramel is much more restrained, less chewy, slightly darker, and maybe even slightly burnt compared with the aroma. More of it comes through here as it warms though.

Glass: Duvel tulip.

The head is cream colored and puffs up quite nicely. Easy to swirl back up, as well. Lots of little bubbles. Good lacing and retention. Lots of hops in the aroma. Im getting earthy and fruity flavors: berries, citrus, grass, pine, spice. The hops dominate, but theres a solid malt character underneath. Toasty caramel and brown sugar. Mild bready sweetness. Good dose of nutty flavor. Mild vanilla. The taste is dry, particularly for the style, and medium bitter. Dried out crystal malt caramel backbone with that spicy, earthy, fruity hoppiness on top. Starts off with honey and caramel before the grapefruit rind and pine resin bitterness takes over, bringing with it all of the more delicate hop notes, as well. Lots of hop flavor in finish, which hits with a nice shot of bitterness and lingering fruit. Prickly carbonation. Seems a touch higher than most Ambers. Light feel for a 7% abv beer, not really surprising since its rather dry. I dont love the style, but this is an excellent example and a very well made beer. Its dry and bitter with good flavor.

2356,"2014-06-14",2.4,"Hazy red and brown tainted orange hue topped by a creamy off-white head that slowly fades. Fruity, sappy, coniferous hop-focused nose. Strong red fruits, both from esters and hops I believe and amplified by the very toasty, caramelized malts giving a jammy, fruit rich and almost juicy presence, but to me, kinda clashing with the caramel flavours to form a candy-like fruit bar, that could always work on its own, but in the second half and finish in mouth, gets completely demolished by the agressive bitter wave, laden with citric acid. Those hops are pitiless, more intense on the bitter than aromatic end. Meanwhile, the carbonation is pristine, well tuned as is always the case with Maine Beer Co, and this certainly helps, but the candy feel detracts from the mouthfeel enjoyment. I could not get into that one, no fatal flaws per se, but the balance just did not tune at all with my palate.

I ate some of the foam and it was bitter. Once the off-white somewhat reddish head dissipated it revealed a cloudy dark, brownish red beer. The beer smells of hops and a metallic sweetness much like Ithaca cascazilla, just smells like red ale basically. Taste is pretty good and has this great, somewhat creamy body with light carbonation that is just perfect like Maines Lunch. Light and easily sessionable, has a decent hop presence but no lingering bitterness. Not ultimately too flavorful does has a good hop/malt balance but at the end of the day just taste like a regular red ale, moderately bitter and a metallic sweetness.

In body, the beer is clear and clean, but with a pronounced haze, perhaps from the heavy use of hops in the beer. On the nose, the beer smells richly of citrus grapefruit and prickly pine. The caramel malt is also nicely present, giving the nose caramel bread notes. Sweet citrus pith is dominant on the nose, however, and provides a nice aroma. The yeast character is clean and faint on the nose, and as the beer warms you do get a touch of hot alcohol on the nose, unfortunately. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter and softly roasty, with a nice bready sweetness balancing out the sip. Mild citric acidity plays into the finish, where the beer dries out and gives the tongue a nice bitter click. In flavor, the beer begins as caramel roast, almost like a light ice coffee with toffee syrup. Citrus quickly swims onto the tongue, providing strong grapefruit flavors. The finish is like grapefruit juice with a touch of medicinal bitters and caramel bread, and the aftertaste is citric bitters and sweet toffee and bread. As the beer warms, the rich malt does appear more pronounced in the aftertaste, giving off warm oat bread flavors with a touch of caramel and toffee. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body, almost light, but with a creamy carbonation and crisp mouthfeel that provide for a very interesting sip. There is a slight, resiny stickiness left in the mouth after the swallow. Overall, this is a more hop-forward amber ale, but it gives beautiful malt character as well. As the beer warms, more and more of the caramel bread can be sensed in the beer. The balance ends slightly on the bitter side, which will appease any hop heads, but the malt balance is also delicious. This beer is another success from the MBC, and honestly might give Zoe a run for her money. A side by side test will need to be administered.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

The aroma has that big green plant hop profile. It really captures the memory of a hop tea. Just a touch of malty sweetness creeps into the flavor. That hop bitterness and and plant-like hop profile are the dominant characteristics in this beer. Another great beer from MBC.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

Notes of tobacco, bitter hops, ash, orange, figs, and dry herbs, Like most ambers I try, they get way too grainy and ashy with overly bitter hops being showcased.
