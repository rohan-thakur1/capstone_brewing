360,"2017-06-15",4.1,"Almost clear light amber with lasting off white head. Fantasticly complex and balanced aroma of cornflakes, bread, citrus and vinegar etc. Not overly acidic. The taste is low in sweetness and bitterness and has a distinct but balanced acidity. Finish and aftertaste follows the same flavors and is balanced all the way through. Great beer.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Brewhemia"
360,"2017-06-14",3.7,"2015 bottle shared by Johnnnie on 5/20/17.Clear, well-carbonated, bronze-golden with strong copper tints and a white head atop that fades slowly to a ring.Id be curious to know what the proportions of each blenderys lambic are used in this. From the nose I get a LOT of leather, cider, light green apple, sweat, mineral and hay-like grains. These things I associate most strongly with Boon, Oud Beersel and to some extent, Lindemans). It doesnt have the vivacious, bright Brett character of 3F, though of course, there is certainly light Brett in the nose. And nor does it have the stronger lactic acidity I associate with De Cam, Timmermans and Hanssens. Whatever the case, its very approachable with a surprisingly large amount of malt character (rich honey, hay, wheat-like cereal) to easily balance the tart, lemony Brett and light lactic sourness. A bit of farm-y character, though its more cider and mineral-dominated. No alcohol or flaw.Bright and lemony with light cider on the edges and a good lactic sourness that fails to completely pucker the mouth or strip the enamel. Its well-balanced showing the aforementioned honey-like malt with even a touch of biscuity wheat. Lots of musty, cellar quality as it warms and breathes. Doesnt display the sheer force of intense lambic flavor that 3F and Cantillon do, for me, as theres a lot of, while pleasant, extraneous flavors at work. Slightly bigger body than Id like, could use just a bit more dryness. Otherwise, very lovely and Im sure much more approachable than most lambics.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

360,"2016-12-29",3.8,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Drie Fonteinen Restaurant on November 12. 750 mL bottle, 2015 vintage. The pour is a dark orangey gold color with a thick white head and no lace as it falls down to a thin cap. The aroma carries a lightly metallic malt to it, but its pretty good. There is a bright citrus zest and a funky yeast going on. There is a bit of barnyard on the back end, and its actually pretty nice. There is a bit of oak as well as it wraps up. The flavor is similar. The metallic fades, but a mineral tendency introduces itself. The oak is there and strong and the citric acid gets a little lighter. The mouth feel is nice. Its a little heavy, but well carbonated and leaves a nice tart and funky barnyard mix of fruit skins on the finish. This is pretty lovely.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

360,"2016-01-22",3.5,"2015 Vintage:

AROMA: Musty, dank, mellow tropical fruits, maybe even medicinal but on a very low level.

APPEARANCE:Blonde going on for golden, huge white head nearly escaped the glass though it quickly diminished into a lasting wispy one. 

TASTE: Not as Intense as one might imagine, quite a spritzy bugger. Sourish, although those who dont drink Gueuze regularly may take that as a pinch of salt. Just overall not the most intense Gueuze but still very good. 

PALATE: Long lasting dank aftertaste with an low level of of tropical fruit and over ripe green apples. 

OVERALL: Please take this in context. A good Gueuze however not the best from the country. Still am excellent example though and I have 4 bottles of it cellaring which is testament to its quality. Really, really good but not one of the best.","Manchester, Lancashire, ENGLAND","Belgianloner"

Musty aroma with lots of earthy barnyard character along with lactic funk, damp oak, hay, light fruit and acidic acid. Subtle acetic character but its not solvent-like or overly vinegary. Oak tannins along with musty bugs, horseblanket, lactic funk, grass and straw. Some light fruit in there as well, notably apple and pear complimenting the lemon acidity. The nose on this beer is pretty complex with plenty of earthy funk. 

Full bodied with soft carbonation and tart, puckering sourness that lingers over the barnyard/ lactic funk flavors, oaky tannins, light fruit and citrus acidity into a tart, dry finish. Very nice sour element by not harsh or overly acetic. Crisp citrus/lemon juice acidity countered by earthy oak and lactic cheesiness. Sweaty with dry, funky bugs, lemon spritz and a lingering soft acetic flavor that makes me drool for more.

2014-08-16. Hazy golden body with a modest white head 3+ Aroma is quite funky, pleasant notes of musty lemon and grapefruit seeds. 7++ Flavour is pretty sour up front but quickly mellows just a touch, sour lemon, musty straw notes. Average bodied palate, soft effervescent carbonation. Quite nice. Lacks the depth and diversity of some but is quite nice and pleasantly zippy. 8/4/8/3-4/16 Bottle at Campground Brewdown
2013-01-31. Hazy dark yellow body with a small tan head. 3+ Aroma is pleasantly funky and barnyardy. 7++ Flavour is moderately sour and fairly barnyard funky throughout.

My only real rate of the second evening was this blend from almost every major lambic brewery. The price did not seem too extravagant and while I could find 2013 vintages almost everywhere this is the only place Id seen the previous edition. I look forward to trying the 2013 soon to do a comparison.

Aroma / Appearance - The carbonated golden base and wispy bubbly head show signs of life. Dry, yeasty, and peppery this is not quite as sharp as the ones from a single brewery. However it still has a nice mix of blue cheese and vinegar that settles in the air.

Flavor / Palate - Vinegar and blue cheese pair together at moderate levels. It is tart, crisp, and acidic but not nearly so much as some other examples. The result is a beer that is much easier to drink yet still retains plenty of flavor. The yeasty peppery finish is a reminder of its inspiration as a collaboration since it matches none of the house profiles of each brewery. This is worth buying if you catch a bottle for under 15 Euro.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Flowery and herbal again with the same dry woodiness, pollen, wildflowers, and apple orchard. Mild, but balancing tartness and a bit more tangy lactic acid. Fruitiness that wasnt really found in the nose is now here. Plenty of lemon, a bit of lime, apple, and peach. Solid here with good complexity and depth.

3.75 M: Lighter medium body. Good upper moderate carbonation. Not particularly creamy or spritzy, but good nonetheless.

4.0 D: Solid all around. A bit pricey, but such is the style. Definitely worth a try and a not a bad beer to stock up on either.

Served in my Cantillon tulip.

A: This beer appears very hazy and orange in color. As this was shared at a tasting and not continuously poured, I am quite certain that I received some sediment in my serving, creating the cloudier than normal appearance. The head hangs out for a while before leaving a few touches of lacing upon the glass.

S: The aroma is just terrific. I so enjoy the smell of an authentic Belgian gueuze. I could enjoy this aroma for hours. Funky and awesome, with hints of musty citrus and wild grasses.

T: The taste was also terrific. Nice and funky, and very easy to drink. The flavor lingers long after each sip.

The flavor adds more balance and much more sweetness.  The webby funk is decent, more sweetness with a light peppery spice.  Peaches and a touch of lemon with a fairly sour spike to it.

Treating myself after work with a bit of homework. Just arrived in the shop alongside some other amazing Lambics, so thought Id give this a whirl. As soon as I saw it was a mega blend, I HAD to try it.
Pours loose with a tight bubbly head. This is quite interesting, as it acts as though its a sparkling wine. It has that white wine aroma, taste, and sparkle, and as with previous experiences of lambics, I find I keep reminding myself that this is a beer. That is one thing I do love about Lambics.
The sparkle gives constant streams of bubbles coming from several points at the base of the glass (drinking from a Westmalle chalice), and keeps the tight head constant.
A pleasant beer with a lovely aftertaste which shoots in and out quite quickly to create a dry finish.
Nose appears to have a nice sweet element.
Admittedly not the best Geuze Ive had this week, but a treat none the less!
Fairly dessert wine-esque.","Canterbury, Kent, ENGLAND","BottleshopDave"

Tingling, persistent carbonation; even fizz; stomach-gurgling, sherbet acidity mellowed into drinkability. Lime juice/zest, Brie rind, cream cheese, crab apple, Love Heart.

Dusty basement notes are enlivened by citrus fruit and wheat biscuits before an acetic punch seals this dry Gueuze. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam tops the cloudy dark yellow.
-The flavor profile was more intense than the aroma, as well as more revealing.
-White grapes are part of the fruity character tasted.
-The frothy effervescence, made of tiny bubbles, increases drinkability for such an intense brew.
-Sourness is prominent, and refreshment is guaranteed, if you can tolerate this level of intensity in acidity, that is.

360,"2011-05-29",4.4,"2009 bottling, bottle no. 12739, courtesy 4.4-40.  The cork shot out of this puppy like a rocket as soon as the cage was loosened.  The body is a hazy dark golden color.  A thin white film settles in at the head and lasts for the duration of the drink.  Aromas are funky as all hell, showing a strong, pervasive barnyard must all the way from start to finish.  Notes of horseblanket, footy cheese, and musty old basement are distinct.  Dust and old, soured, slightly seasoned wood are too.  Sharp, pithy lemon acidity walks in step with all the must, providing its citric counterpoint.  Flavors follow suit, intensely musty and loaded with aged farmhouse cheese, sourdough bread, and tangy apricots.  Old wet wood and sharp, oily lemon are wonderful compliments.  Dusty brett and sour lacto are both wild and focused at the same time.  Delicious stuff.  This beer just feels ALIVE.....and it is.  The palate is substantial for a gueuze, showing a good amount of smooth malt to counter the spritzy, dusty, drying body.  Awesome stuff.  I should have bought a ton of this stuff when I had the chance.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Very carbonated, with a bit of an astringent finish. My girlfriend, who hates geuze, thinks it has a Brut Champagne-y finish and I agree, its very very pleasant.

The smell is funky and slightly acidic. Notes of lemon, wood and spices. Mild but characterful.

Taste is very good. Very sour with notes of lemon and apples. An almost raw acidity. Notes of grass and wood. Lots of funk going on - barnyard, mud and hey. But the funk is obviously restrained by the acidity. The finish has a gentle grassy bitterness to it and notes of minerals. Unfortunately, the finish gets cut off by very lively and aggressive carbonation.

Medium body with a dry finish. Very effervescent, the carbonation actually kills the finish.

A good one. Would love to try it with some age on it.

360,"2009-08-08",4.2,"Best by 16.10.2028; Sampled August 2009
A very careful pour still manages to produce four-fingers of head in my 25cl plus an additional almost two fingers above the rim.  The head is a light tan hue and the beer is a grassy, pale amber hue that shows a nice orange-gold hue and a touch of haze when held up to the light.  Some light, but nice lacing forms on the sides of my glass as the head slowly subsides.  The aroma has a nice grassy funkiness to it that reminds me of a mix of hay, weeds, phenolic soaked cotton, musty damp horse blankets along with a requisite musky, almost dried sweat stench.  The sharper notes in the nose are defined by the lactic acid, a hard urea-laced spicing, some phenolic wild mushroom notes.  The finish has some nice pale grain and fresh crushed wheat character to it.  This is actually on the funky side for a Gueuze, and I must say it is quite nice. 

This beer has a nice, solid, almost bracing lactic sourness.  This finishes with a nice spicy oak note as well as some tannic woody notes, both of which integrate quite well with the other flavors in this beer.  A touch of urea, or cat-pee for the Lambic traditionalist, is found in the flavor.  There are some grassy notes up front and in the middle that are separate from the hint of grain character that is left in this beer (though this seems to contribute some grassiness and a touch of pale grain in the finish; not as much as is found in the nose though).  While this seems bone dry, some of the notes here contribute a fruitiness that reminds me of sour-apples, a distinct grapefruit note in the finish.  The finish has a long, lingering, sort of cotton mouth astringency to it from both the oak and phenolic notes.  This is musty flavored but not as strongly so as in the aroma; musky, Brettanomyces notes, and some old sweat soaked blanket notes are found here as well.

My second pour is still as carbonated as the first.  I get to drinking this much sooner than my first pour and this literally explodes as it hits my tongue with a aggressive effervescent that turns the beer into foam as it rolls across my tongue.  The grapefruit note starts to come out more as it warms, some Klockera perhaps, and there seems to be a nice toasted oak character to the finish now as well.  Other fruit notes of ripe, but unsweet, quite aromatic, tart melon and perhaps a touch of pear also become more apparent as this warms and actually turn into quite the juicy fruit character.

I am so glad that my bottle has been cleaned of all the diacetyl that has been troubling some peoples bottles.  Pediococcus is a prodigious diacetyl producer and Lambics definitely need time to reduce it back out.  I am so glad that this turned out to be quite tasty.  Man this is quite good, about as tart / sour as I could want with just enough funkiness to keep things interesting.  This is a fantastic example of a Gueuze, at least this particular bottle is; if you are too worried just hold on to these for a 6 months or so (perhaps the international shipping helped my bottles).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Corked 2015 Bottle, Tasted december 2015. Golden color. Oak, grapefruit, confit fruit and pineapple in the aroma. Sour flavor with lemon, honey and pineapple. Lots of carbon. Oak especially noticeable in the finish. Well blended, complex geuze that perhaps needs more time. (8 4 8 4 16)","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"

360,"2009-05-31",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2011 Megablend  2009  version <Timmermans label, but all beer is blended @ F. Boon  Towering off-white head; hazy ochre-copper beer. Tart, grapey nose with overpowering horseblanket, spent grain, leathergrease and lunaria. Sweetish, grapey again, and Im getting old cheesy hops. Finish is drier. Fuller bodied than most gueuzes, with sourness coming as an afterthought, with again hops coming up in the very aftertaste. Surprising beer, just a bit different, but well-worth looking for.

Megablend 2011 version - beer is totally different from the 2009 version IMO 
Small white head, rather stable over hazy old dried straw-coloured beer. 4/5 Citrus, green apple, Bretts, saddlesoap, unripe lemons and kafir limes  9/10 Very tart, lactic acid, outspokenly citrussy and, nearly as an afterthought, the leather/saddlesoap flavour. Yet very balanced.  10/10 Tart, lipsmacking acidity, no trace of acetic acid, slightly liming. 4/5 Wow - a huge improvement compared to the first Megablend. This ranks amongs the true topgueuzes available.  19/20","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

360,"2009-05-25",3.7,"750 ml bottle shared by Tertons!  Forgot the # but was in the 12,000s and didnt take note of its back label to determine where it came from.   Pours a deep gold with lively carbonation already - high for a new gueuze, and a frothy white head dissipates a bit- fizzy.  Aroma is moderate funk, orange peel, pez candy, mineral, chalk, earth, slight DMS and vegetal, with old and new wood, and hints of salty brine- good seems a bit clean.  Flavor has some weird earthy and solvent funk, lightly horsey citrus, lemon zest, slight salty notes, olive- light DMS leather, mineral and earth.  Finish is prickly light to moderate acidic, not overly sour at all, woody astringency and hints of grapefruit in the end as it warms.  Pretty good overall, a bit strange and different and with its subtle strange funk character it remains overall fairly clean still.  Not sure how this will age- at least maybe some of the DMS may fade a bit.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

360,"2009-05-22",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2014 Bottle (750ml).  At MesandSims, London May 10 2009).  Cloudy orange, bubbly, with an average diminishing off-white frothy head.  Odd smell here - buttery diacetyl, odd in a lmabic - but underlying is a decent sweet caramel malt and lemony yeast aroma.  The taste, well, its getting there - this is quite young for a lambic, and it shows - aggressive sour lemon, sweet malt, neither have mellowed toward each other much yet, and its way too carbonated..  Fizzy, sticky mouthfeel, with a very quick finish - theres no big funky linger, not a lot of acdici yeasty goodness to remind you of mister toads lambic ride.  We all agreed that this might, with some aging, develop into a pretty solid sour, but right now its pretty green, with no depth or character.   Oh yeah - when the corked was popped, we thought it was going to gush all over the place, but it never did.  ** re-rated with a 2011 bottle on January 31, 2014 - original rating from 2009 was 6-3-7-3-13=3.2 ... this was much smoother, less aggressive, quite pleasant and a solid sour.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Semi-fizzy texture.  Baked apples and truffle oil.   Butter and solvent is far too heavy in the nose.  Difficult to like.  I dont know what else to say.


Rerate a couple of weeks later isnt so bad - more plain/bland/stale than solvent-like and spoiled.  Still not a great geuze my any means, but at least better than my first impression.  Rating upped from 2.7 to 3.1","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
