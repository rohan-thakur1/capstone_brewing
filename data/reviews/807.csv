807,"2015-04-15",4.0,"Its hard to rate this beer a 9 or 10 overall, based on pilsners not having much aroma and appearance. With that said, this is probably a very high 8....say an 8.8. One of the most crisp beers that Ive had. Seems pretty light, but has a nice alcohol content and will fill you up. You can really taste the malt in this one. Has a pale yellow appearance, with a very light white head. I try not to spend this kind of money too often for high priced beers, but this is worth the price....well, almost.

807,"2015-03-22",4.4,"Look, I'm all about ales, lager just ain't my thing. That might be why this is getting a higher rating than usual, I will admit. 

Hoppy and thick through the nose; a clean, yet golden haze on sight. The head was thick initially but faded too quickly (bottle poured), yet whilst there it held a lovely citrus, hinting on something sweet, like a light caramel. The palate carried those hops through and this is where the malt character drove its way home. ""Hedonistic""** is how those Rogues described it, but the malt had a tingle and bite that draws away from the pleasure (hey, don't get me wrong, I love a tough IBU to chew through), but it had interest and tang and a freshness that made this ""Aleman"" turn his head and say ""hot damn"". It still had a lot of lager essentials (that Yeastie flavour, that bites and kicks back, but it just turned its nose to all the bad, and gave a good nod to what I hope is a new world of the lighter, simpler style).

Best Lager I've had, by far. How ""true to form"" it is... I can't say. But if you're of my opinion, and steer clear of Lagers, find this. Thank the Rogue guys later.

807,"2014-06-09",3.9,"Reviewed from notes.
This was poured into a pilsener.
The appearance was a decent looking hazy orange to light brown color with a nice transparency running about it. It was definitely light enough to see the carbonation rising at a moderate pace. There was a two finger white foamy head that dissipated about a minute and left a nice spider web lacing sticking finely to the sides of the glass.
The smell had a nice typical light spiciness (from an Imperial Pilsener) with a decent bitter to sweet hoppy to malty complexity.
The taste followed the aroma almost exactly and it had a nice spicy to sweet to bitter aftertaste and a dry finish.
On the palate, it sat about a light to medium. Still, it shows just enough sessionability and has a nice carbonation running about it.
Overall, in my opinion, this was a mighty fine Imperial Pilsner well worthy of having again and well worthy of having with its respected food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

807,"2011-02-04",3.4,"Pours very rough from the re-sealable clay bottle. Causes the strong floral aroma to really permeate the surrounding air. A dense, long lasting, creamy white head is also created from the rough pour. A deep golden color brew is present in the glass with a slight chill haze present. The nose has a sstrong floral hops kick followed by a strong graininess that also incorporates a low caramel toastedness as well as slight cream ale light finish. Flavor starts off with a mild grassy presence, lots of sweet flowery tastes follow with a mild graininess at the end. Alcohol doesnt seem to be a  dominate factor in this brew. Body is modest but the low carbonation was a bit disappointing as a typical pils normally has a great sharp carbonation to it. Overall a pretty pleasant brew. My only knock on it would be the carbonation but this was on the discount rack so who knows how long it was there.

Cloudy dark gold color....thick head ... Hazy.... not your typical pilsner color. 

All malt smell ... nice sweet pilsner/lager smell, just amplified.

The feel is thick and creamy. Its a tad bubbly. Very dry. Leaves a malty film which isnt entirely welcome. Its not a bad beer. Its pretty got-damn strong for a pils, thats for sure. One and thats about all I can do.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

Purchaced in early to mid 2006. Poured out a small off-white cap with a small ammount of retention that sat on top a viscus, cloudy, nice orangy gold brew. Lots of slow moving bubbs. Better than average lacing for a Pilsner. The aroma is nothing special although it does come across appealing, but still only average. You can note the grassy grain and a touch of alcohol but it is well hidden. The fruity aroma lessens along with the level of brew in my glass. There are also some soft biscuity malts. There is a touch of the ole grapefruit hops and some alcohol but the hops cover it up nicely. Decent malts too. Good bitter hops. Now that its warming, the bitterness has surpassed the majority of other flavours. There is other stuff to find but it comes and goes and is very faint. Medium bodied. If you suck on your tongue youll find that the hard bitterness never really leaves. A slight alcohol burn with some harshness as well. A smooth and highly drinkable beer that is totally overpriced but I guess the 20 bucks goes to the ceramic bottle.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

A spicy, grassy green apple aroma, like a mince tart rolled down a hill i guess.  Certainly an intense mouthful, as the desc. puts it; for a pilsner.

807,"2009-06-03",3.1,"16 ounce pint - $7.25 at Taco Mac in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Clearish, golden body with a thin, white head on top.

Smell: Sweetish waft of pils maltiness rounded out by some earthy, spicy hops scents and unripened fruit notes.

Taste: Ponderous amount of pilsner malts downed with a spoonful of confectioners sugar. Interesting fruity blend of passion fruit, white grape, and tart pears. Small pinch of Goodys Headache Powder precedes a rustic, earthy, caustically pithy hop character with a pronounced medium-high amount of bitterness. However, the staunch bitterness really embodies the last half of the beer. Finishes dry, a tad warming, and bitter.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Theres a very light stickiness to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: The heavy nature of these Imperialized, Double-fied pilsners totally negate the simple, refreshing qualities of a good pils. Starts engaging, but, for me, it soon grew tiresome and turned into the beer-equivalent of helping someone move.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
807,"2009-06-03",3.5,"This has been in my fridge for a while now, Iv just been waiting for just the right moment to crack it and since that will never seem to happen Ill drink it now.The beer pours a slightly cloudy honey brown and produced a thick white head that disappeared about half way threw the glass. The aroma is slightly sour, malty and had just a touch of hops thrown in, I didnt hate the smell but its nothing to get so excited over you piss your pants waiting for the first sip. I found the taste very refreshing and easy drinking what was surprising given the high alcohol content and thats probably because you cant taste the high alcohol. The beer is good and malty (sweet malts) and balanced with just a touch of hops, what is great for me because I find Rogue over hops most of there beers. Im finding this beer is tasting more like a less hoppy IPA then a pilsner but that really dosnt matter because Im enjoying it. The after taste is intensely bitter on the back of the tongue and just a touch of alcohol. This is a good beer not a great one, and would buy it again if it wasnt so high priced, but on a other positive side the 9% alc. knocks you on your ass after chugging the massive bottle however this may cause you to pee your pants.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"

807,"2009-02-13",3.3,"In short: A boosted Pilsner that maintains the characteristics of the style.  Unfortunately a little too sugary sweet.
How: Bottle 750ml (ceramic flip-top).  Consumed relatively fresh a few months after purchase 
The look: Cloudy dark yellow body topped by a medium white head
In long: Nose blends sweet fruits and noble hops.  Taste is crunchy crystal malts, sugary sweetness with a sensation of old honey turning sugary, light fruity note of apricots, a little alcohol bite, a good amount of dry grassy hops but not quite enough to properly balance the sugary nature of the beer.  Lacks the crispness and dryness of a good real Pilsner but as far as Imperial Pilsners are concerned (a bastard style that shouldnt exist) I guess this is a good one.  A bigger-is-better American pilsner with a Japanese name usually synonymous with smaller-is-better.

Sampling Notes:
Served chilled in pilsner glass.
Rich pilsner grain background, grainy biscuit, touch of vanilla. Hops come through in a torrent, bitter citrus grapefruit coming to mind, herbaceous and perfumey, sharp spice, hallmarks of Saaz hops or something similair. 
Hazy golden body, seems to get hazy towards the bottom of the bottle. Doesnt appear to be much beading and the small persistant white head suggests the same.
Big mouthfeel, huge length and bitterness to match, chewy texture, carbonation is low, and alcohol is slightly apparent in the sheer density.
Hops play through on the body, quite aggressive with bitter orange, grapefruit and lemon, as well as spice. Vanilla biscuit malt is a bit of an after thought, contributing to a draw out finish that isnt too dry, but clean and very bitter.
Big beer, certainly seems like a good pilsner but with big balls. Though I think the hop intensity as far as aromatics and flavour complexity, seemed a bit disappointing.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
807,"2008-12-27",3.7,"Decorative ceramic bottle.  Pours clear gold with a minimal white head.  Crisp and hoppy aroma with some malt.  Flavor is about the same, except you get the malt before the hop.  Not outstanding, but good.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"

807,"2008-11-20",2.8,"Rogue Brewing out of Oregon has a year-round profile which always manages to please, but to date their one-offs and specialty beers have been hit-or-miss, with the misses currently being in the majority. In particular, their ceramic series has left me far from impressed or tempted to enjoy another. Today I tackle another of their ceramic flip-top series, the Morimoto Imperial Pilsner. While the bottle is pretty, what lurks inside remains to be seen.

My Morimoto Imperial Pilsner poured a dark, almost dirty straw color with a small head which fades very quickly into a thin layer. A few repeated swirls produce a rather impressive scattering of lace which clings almost desperately to the sides of my glass. Her nose is an interesting array of dank grass, hard-boiled eggs, and fresh sticky pine sap. My first sip is sweet and then immediately followed up by a bitter bite which lingers long after. I am immediately reminded of a sweeter mild IPA and less of a pilsner, imperial or not. Sweet malts hint of caramel and honey with some herbal notes lingering with the sweet and resinous pine. As she warms, the biscuit and honey malts develop an off-flavor to them and more of the hard-boiled eggs I got in the nose come out to play. The ceramic container it comes in is large, and as I pour my second glass, some fresh melon and orange tease my nose but none are present in the palate. Dry and crisp in her finish with a tart, citric bit which hints of grapefruit. Right about now, Im not quite sure where this beer is going. While I have no intention of pouring her down the drain, Im not sure what it is I am drinking and what the Morimoto Imperial Pilsner is trying to tell me. I am left with a slightly sour and rotten aftertaste, sticky hop oils, and bland malty esters.

A very jumbled mess from start to finish, even my writing muse has difficulty making a cohesive summary of what exactly my palate is experiencing. I applaud Rogues efforts to try something new and different, but maybe instead of a pretty ceramic container, they should have concentrated more on perfecting and crafting a beautiful brew to go inside.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Near medium body with creamy carbonation. Turns a bit thin as the carbonation leaves. Flavor is nicely bitter - grassy bitter. There is quite a bit of malt to go with all of that bitter.  Seems balanced. One of the hoppier lagers, but not quite so much as the Sam Adams version. Very tasty. A little spice, a little touch of fruit. Leaves the mouth rather dry and bitter.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
807,"2008-05-07",3.9,"Aroma: Rather faint; caramel malts and herbal/spicy hops come through. Kind of a pumpkin smell, as well, with just a hint of clove.

Appearance: Cloudy red-orange with an apple cider quality. Creamy but overly excited head dissipates rather quickly, leaving wispy, cobweb-ish lacing.

Flavor: Very fruity. Prune juice, orange rindy hops, and theres some banana action going on, like a dunkel weizen. A bit of powdery yeast runs through it as well, and just a drop of maple-like sweetness. This is not like any other pilsener Ive had before. It goes pretty well with my New Years Day dinner, consisting of roast goose, cranberry-pecan wild rice stuffing, and green beans. Alcohol is more present as it warms.

Palate: Medium bodied, and surprisingly sharp and dry.

Overall: I did really enjoy this beer and I recommend it, but I cant say Ill ever buy it again. At most places its $16 a bomber (I found it for $12), and Im afraid its just not worth that. Awesome bottle, though.","Kitakyushu-shi, JAPAN","soulgrowl"

Theyve obviouslyl got a signature brewing style - big and hop-forward, usually with a nice chewy body - which lends itself well to certain kinds of beers, including this one. To me, what always makes this beer is the dry taste - not candied or too buttery like some versions - which complements the generous malting. Hallertau in here? Maybe, although theres certainly some floral stuff happening along with the more biting German hops.

The flavor features tons of pilsner malt flavor up front (very sweet) with yeasty, grassy supporting notes coming in behind and concluding in a lightly dry, lingering finish (unlike a tradition pilsners quick, crisp finish).

The body is a mouth full and the carbonation is lively while the texture is smooth, creamy and inviting. The flavor starts out lightly bitter and grows to become a bit intense in the middle then fades toward the end of the long finish. There is a nice alcohol warmth in the chest at the end as well.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"

Flavors are heavily toasty, with creamy, buttery toffee malts and significant hoppy bitterness.  Again, a few drops of honey save the day and make everything right.

Finishes with plenty of earthy hop flavor, some slight citrus flavors, and a nice flavorful bitter grassy earthy aftertaste.

I hate to say it but I was disappointed with this promising attempt at the Imperial Pilsner when I bought the gorgeous ceramic flip-top bottle. I do believe there is potential here, because pilsners can be underappreciated for their clean simplicity. Either Rogue can do better or this one should be aged to mellow out. Certainly its floral and has a sturdy build but the beer seemed all hopped up--and not in the right ways. However, I aprpeciated the enthusiastic foamy head and rich golden color.

807,"2007-06-23",4.3,"Pours a deep and very cloudy gold with hints of orange. It pours up an immense, cloudy, uneven, off-white head that laces the glass heavily and lasts impressively - fading to a persistent, medium-sized, rocky layer floating on the beer. The aroma is an excellent mix of malt and hops - big, chewy, sweet, malty smells mixed with fragrant, grassy, almost perfumy hops. The aroma, overall, leans towards the malts. The first sip has a delightful maltiness. The tip of the tongue detects the sweet flavors of caramel and honey mixed with bitter and flowery hop flavors - again, leaning more towards malty and sweet. The middle of the tongue detects a more complex balance - a taste of peppery, bitter hops slowly begins to balance the huge malt presence. By the end, the back of the tongue tastes a very well-balanced, hoppy mixture that has begun to lean away from the malts and towards the hops. Masterful. The finish is medium in body and long. The after-taste is a rich mixture of grassy hops and faint notes of honey. The mouthfeel is a bit thick, but is well tempered by the carbonation resulting in a creaminess that hides the heavy body. The alcohol is virtually undetectable too - it is very well hidden. Overall impression: a very tasty strong lager with interesting layers, or ""waves"", of flavor. Also, it came in a kick-ass bottle that includes a free-hanging pop-top (as the bottle is capped) that could be used if you dont drink the whole thing at once (all 26 oz.).","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Ive had this one for a couple months now. A warm day helped me decide to finally crack it open. Morimoto Imperial Pilsner pours with a glug glug into a pilsner glass. A beautiful crystal clear golden body fills the glass. Numerous big carbonation bubbles rise rather quickly to the 2 finger craggy white head that forms. The head eventually falls to 1 finger and leaves spotty lacing. A really wonderful looking beer.

The smell is inviting and refreshing. Clean raw graininess along with a nicely subdued hay and grassy hop aromas. Theres a mild sugary sweetness in there as well.

This is a truly refreshing beer. Very simple flavors yet theyre very well rounded and in perfect balance. Raw graininess starts things off and is present in the background throughout. Mild grassy hops show up midway through along with a subdued sugary sweetness. This sugary sweetness actually compliments the other flavors very nicely. Nice hop spiciness on the swallow. Every now and then I get mild alcohol fumes on the swallow.

Body is surprisingly light for such a high ABV. Good carbonation keeps things moving and awakens the tongue. Finishes dry and very crisp. Refreshing.

This is an easy beer to put back. I could easily see myself drinking this all day long and I would if I could find it for $5.99 all the time.

This is a superb beer from Rogue. Unbelievably refreshing and crisp for such a high ABV. This is usually an expensive bottle but I would definately suggest trying it at some point in time. Excellent!

It pours a really awesome honey amber with a good amount of viscosity, and a solid, foamy head. Aromas of nicely roasted malt that gives it a nice floral, sweet aroma. An intense mouthfeel on the first swallow but ones afterwards are very smooth, balanced, with some nice, subtle lingering hoppiness and a great malty aftertaste that reminds you that it really wasnt a pilsner you were drinking.

I didnt have particularly high hopes for this one, but after a long bicycle ride I was in the mood for a pils and while this is not your grandaddys pilsner, it seemed like it would do the trick.

Wow was I surprised. This is a really, really good beer. Its a got a deep, rich flavor driven by the sterling hops but complemented strongly by massive amounts of pilsner malt and intriguing, slightly sour, bready yeast tones. The hops flavors are not as grassy and dry as those from a Saaz-based pilsner, but instead theyre deeply robust, slightly lemon, wonderfully flavorable - and with the malts behind them they make for a very nice chewy taste profile.

The mouthfeel is good - certainly showing its 8.8%, rather than coming off crisp like a proper pils, but thats fine. For this beer it works. Kudos to Rogue; Im not usually a big fan of that brewery but this is certainly among my favorite of their products.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

The taste is much the same, with some moderate bitterness coming in, offsetting the candy sugar and caramel.  Full bodied, light-moderate carbonation.  No, I didnt end up skewing this rating.

This starts down your throat like an innocent little European lager, but then POW the alcohol and oily hoppiness hits at the back of the tongue.

Excellent drinkability, no doubt. The flavour has some alcohol warmth but doesnt really detract anything from the flavour. Yeasty palate and the flavour is something I really love. The hop bitterness is in full effect and its that nice soft grassy flavourful stuff. It doesnt punch you in the face (which I like anyway) but its just straight out tasty stuff. Very nice.

Flavor is similar, with great big bitter hops dominating, their floral and fruity notes playing bit parts only. About the only thing that makes this remotely like a pilsner is that the hop bitterness overwhelms the malt support (appropriate for a pilsner) and the fruity notes are more background noise than prominant features (also appropriate for a pilsner).

A nice dry maltiness is matched by a very balanced hop element.  I cannot for the life of me find the 8.8 abv.  Entirely too refreshing in fact.

But the earthy flavor is unmistakeable, and that is ruining the flavor of this Imperial Pilsener.  Medium bodied, but it seems like ages since it was remotely crisp.  But at least the beer is very pretty; its orange-golden in color, fairly cloudy, and topped by a tall and extremely persistent off-white head.  It retains a quarter inch of foam for the entire session and leaves dense, thick patches of lace on the glass.  Frankly, this tastes about as ""old"" as a four-year old Stone IPA I tasted recently, and this is nowhere near as old as that beer.  A poor ager, so if you find it in a store at this point, you probably should pass.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Aroma:   Very strong and in your face hop aroma.  More of an earthy floral nose somewhat fitting the pilsner style just way over the top.  Some nice munich malt character did come through as it warmed.

Appearance:  Cloudy and just a bit dark for the Pilsner style.  Good head stand

Flavor:   Immense hop flavor.  Some malt but nowhere near balance.  Hops dominate.  Finished dry with a bit of alcohol warmth.

Mouthfeel:   Carbonation twang and very bitter.  There is some body in this brew from the abundance of malt but bitterness definitely dominates.

Overall Impression:  This is a pilsner on steroids.  Very hop dominant.  Way too over-the-top to be called a pilsner IMHO.  

So there you have it.  This beer did get better with each sip.  My impression on first taste was, literally, what the hell is this!  I warmed up to the beer somewhat but probably will not get it again.  I guess Im just too much of a wimp for this Imperial Pilsner.","Illinois, USA","SpikedHelmet"

In the middle is sweet malt. Around the edges are citrus and some stone fruit flavors. Kind of like a bitter Mai Bock. The bitterness is too rough for the other flavors in my opinion. That criticism aside, it is an interesting brew.","austin, Texas, USA","biz82"
807,"2004-10-27",4.3,"#100:  I learned from this bottle you have to be patient and pour very gently or a else a huge monster foam will build up, and wont break down.  White and thick head at first but the head will shrink to a thin foam and cover the beer through out the drink.  Has a murky orangish yellow hue with little amount of bubbles and i did spot some sediment floating.  Nose is of  hops and a mild floral aroma.  A minimum of lacing does occur.  Flavor has some nectar, orange citrus, honey and a raw dough taste.  Malt and hops are perfectly reflected while drinking and are balanced respectively.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Good bitterness also.  Alcohol is hidden very well in this brew witha  nice bitter finish.  Going to have a great time finishing off this one.

This is certainly an aromatic lager, with a strong, bitter hop nose, covering all but a hint of malt.  Flavor is a massive hop hit, bitter but with plenty of citrusy/piney flavors.  Well-carbonated, and thick in the mouth for a pilsner.  Not what I expected at all from the word pilsner, this beer felt almost like a light-bodied IPA, with its bitter, hop-dominated flavor and aroma.  Nevertheless, an excellent brew.","Athens, Georgia, USA","jcc83"

807,"2004-09-18",3.7,"The beer came in a beautiful (and expensive), porcelain bottle with a cap, and a swing top. The packaging evoked a Japanese influence quite nicely. When poured, the beer had a bright golden color and a smallish short lived head. The carbonation was at a medium strength. The aroma was quite faint, with slightly grassy noble hops and honey like pale malt. The taste was more Maibock than Pilsner, with fruity and sweet malt and only a afterthought to the hops. The mouthfeel was very creamy and buttery-slick, and reminded me a little of movie theatre popcorn. The aftertaste was a bit dry, and was the only place where the alcohol content was evident in a peppery sort of way. There was almost no alcohol induced burning, so the beer was very drinkable. As good as this beer was, if Rogue had put in more hops to make it more in line with the Pilsner heritage, then it would have been a truly spectacular drink.

P.S.: This is an unfiltered Pilsner, and the last pour was much more foamy, with a hazy yeasty body. The taste however did not change much. Either that, or by now the alcohol has gotten to my head.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
807,"2004-09-17",4.0,"A very deep, golden color (more of the color of a pale ale, happens though with beer of this concentration).  Aroma is very spicy, perfumy, and floral in its hops.  Malt aroma is bready and honeyish.  Higher alcohols are apparent in the aroma and flavor and create a fruity/ester presence.  As the beer warms the alcohol overbalances the malt and body making the beer taste thinner than it should.  There is a soild, well balancing bitterness throughout.  Overall a little too fruity in character, but my favorite so far between Dominion(cleaner but slightly more unidimensional)  and Dogfish(too sweet and almost raisiny).","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","AlchemistZ"

Pours hazy golden with a white head. Nice hop aroma. Tastes almost like a dortmunder with more hops. As the beer warms you can taste the alcohol more.

Definitely has some pilsner malt characteristics. Full body is rather airy and displays low carbonation.

Turns very citrus in the middle with lots of grapefruit and then some sour lemon.  Very bitter hoppy finish.  Very dry going away.  Saaz in the finish I believe.

807,"2004-09-02",3.6,"This beer pours a clear, deep gold color.  The pouring process generates a prodigious, thick cream colored head.  The aroma is all hops, with a pleasing spiciness, and notes of hay, light pine, and a sharp grassiness.  The taste is sweet, thickly malty, with lots of hops, but it could actually use a bit more hops to balance out the thick maltiness.  This is definitely enjoyable, the spicy hop flavor and bitter finish are quite nice.  There is a bit of hot alcohol, which does detract slightly.  With this hopping level, if this had been stepped back to a 7% alcohol, it would have been just about perfect.  As it is it is just a bit too malty for my tastes.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Body is a deep gold, almost to the point of being amber-orange.   First pour didnt create a great head due to ""glugging"".  Subsequent pours allowed an average-sized, creamy, lasting, white head to develop.  Heavily sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly acidic, heavily bitter, lasting finish.  Medium-full body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, lightly astringent.  The bottom line is: Im really impressed with how such a big flavor was conjured from such simple ingredients.

Flavor is not so big, but somewhat cloyingly sweet.  There is a substantial hop character from middle to back and a substantial bed of malts.  The palate is thick, syrupy, velvet...about the consistency of unsolidified pudding.  Some light fruitiness emerges.  Subtle, complex flavors for such a big beer.

Bread and sweetness in the malts - body was almost thick - hops were pepper at first, similar to a pils, but also a wood-oaky-edge to them - that seemed to mellow out as it warmed.  Very drinkable, I didn't notice the 8.0% abv til I stood up!  The darn bottle is too heavy - I kept thinking that there was more beer to pour!

Smells crisp and hoppy, not quite as sharp and clean as a true European pils, but still quite crisp and light.  Flavor opens up immediately with some vanilla flavoring, mabye some dry almond liqueur as well, creamy and smooth with a good amount of sweetness.  This transitions in to a big hops flavor that is quite citric, like a ripe naval orange, sweet and tangy.  Ends with a good enough yeasty, caramelly, hoppy mix and plenty of herbal notes as well (juniper, some pine), and Ive got to say I like the flavors, but I just cant get past the use of overly bitter, citric hops in a pils.  Why cant they just use a ton of hallertauer, or tettnangs??  Still, this beer does taste great. 7/5/8/4/16Feb 05 draught at Anam Cara Good transluscent color, small white head.  Aroma of sweet pils malt, lightly sour yeast and a definite dose of raw alcohol.  Light yellow fruits, nectarines, peaches, apricots as well as some honey tones.  Taste just seems to have a touch too much alcohol.  Its not terribly apparent, but just enough to be annoying.  Its not terribly out of style, as every other ESL Ive had has a bit of a harsh grain alcohol taste to it, but I still dont think it belongs.

Poured a nice pale coppery body and a bountiful rocky white head. What the Hell is Pils about this beer? Nothing at all!
I thought the beer was great! The aroma was citric and packed with caramel with caramel. I was digging the flavor; I drank most of the beer because every one else thought is sucked. The finish was sharp and dry woody, with notes of tangerine zests.

There's also a little bit of a corn and floral aroma..but a small hint. The flavor definitely seeps of alcohol. In fact, it was incredibly disappointing to taste just how much alcohol was present...at only 8.8% you would think they could have done more to prevent this from happening. Heavy malt front iwth a very woody and hoppy finish. Can we say hello to the Sterling hops. There also seems to be a good hint of lime in mid taste and some citrus in the finish.

The beer itself is rather dry and floral with lots of herbal fragrances wafting from the glass.

807,"2004-02-17",2.9,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2004 I worry about beers like this.  It could be considered as just part of the trend among American brewers of beefing up every style imaginable.  Pale ales became IPAs.  IPAs became IIPAs.  Stouts became imperial stouts, and so on.  So now pilsner has become imperial pilsner at 8.8% ABV.  The twist however, is that American microbrewers have usually started by making the smaller version before taking it to the next level.  It was as if they took IPA to its limits and needed to go to the IIPA to get something new from the basic style of hoppy ale.  So that leads to my problem: is this just another example of beefing up a style to get something more out of a style that Rogue has already tackled and pushed to its limit?  I don't think so.  It seems as if they've skipped the basic pilsner and went straight to the IP - and that's what bothers me.  The implication being that pilsner in and of itself is a style not worthy of tackling, and they are starting on the premise that for it to be worthy of their brewing, they have to ratchet it up a few notches.  What's wrong with brewing a true session pilsner?  So few American breweries do so, and even fewer brew them in adherence to Bohemian traditions, and again even fewer do that successfully enough to produce a pilsner worthy of international admiration.  I'm waiting.  And just to note, nothing regarding style or expense has biased this rating.  It is as the beer is.
<P>
In the meantime, this beer has a nice spicy hoppy aroma, with a mild graininess skirting the nose.  The malt is full and sweet in the palate, near cloying and grainy.  I'd hesitate to pronounce any 3P fruitiness (peach, pear, persimmon) but I'd equally hesitate to declare this as clean.  Spicy, almost grassy hop flavors are present in moderation.  The finish has a fair bitterness but could stand a bit more IBU to balance the strong malts.  Honestly it drinks like the best malt liquor I've ever had rather than any pilsner I've tasted, especially given its strong sweet, nearly grainy malt component and obvious alcoholic kick.  The further I get into this big bottle, the more malt liquorish it gets, especially in the sense that the sweetish malts become near overbearing and the alcohol really begins to show up.  Appearance is an orange-tinted gold, with a full and thick, near-creamy head that lasts long enough.  Lacing is moderate and widely spaced.  At final pour, I discovered this is bottle conditioned, yielding a more cloudy yellowish white-gold color.  The yeast in the glass smoothed out the flavor quite remarkably.  A bottle-conditioned malt liquor!  And at $12 for the bottle - the Sam Adams Chocolate Bock is by far the better bargain!","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

The flavor is intense but so good, lots of hops here to balance the alcohol that wavers in and out. The finish is strong in the alcohol department but the flavors are still the forestage here. Picked this up for $5 at a local store, so I can't complain about this wonderful little/big beer. The more you drink the more adapted you get to the hoppy flavor but the alcohol still hits strong. One of these bottles packs a good punch, I'm definately feeling it after this one.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
807,"2004-01-23",4.1,"Viscous golden body with luscious foamy snow white head and wispy streams of carbonation.  Nice aroma of grass, citrus, and light caramel malt.  Rich, full flavor.  It's exactly what you expect it to be... a nice, big pilsner.  Has distinct Czech qualities anyway.  Takes some getting used to but becomes very enjoyable.  Scores points for being so novel.  Another fine effort by Rogue.  I recommend serving this fairly cool.  I tasted it at variable temperatures, but for some reason I preferred it on the cooler side.  That way it was refreshing like a pilsner should be but the big, bold notes still came through very nicely.Either through happenstance or perhaps a subliminal message, I immediately bought some sushi after purchasing this beer.  The connection (Morimoto) didn't occur to me until later.  The pairing was terrific.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

807,"2004-01-19",4.2,"Poured out of a very cool bottle that is white ceramic with Japanese lettering and bright swathes of color and as a bonus comes with a swing-top. The beer pours very thick given the golden body. The viscosity makes seem like a pale Imperial Stout. The head is pure white and really sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is lots of orange citrus and a very clean and crisp malt aroma. The flavor is citrus up front then a shocking smack of bitter hops followed by a nice biscuity maltiness. The finish is quite bitter, those 74 IBUs really stand out given the relative lightness of this beer (compared to other 74 IBU beers). There is a slight hit of alcohol towards the beginning of the finish but it is not an unpleasant flavor. Given the style the 8.8% ABV is well hidden. Overall a nice beer but it exhibits a lot of ale characteristics and it is hard to believe that this is a lager. A must try, but true lager fans may be disappointed.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

807,"2004-01-07",3.8,"Great painted ceramic bottle that was capped yet has a swing top attached as well. Poured a slightly hazy bright gold with a huge head that settled down to a not so huge head. Aroma reminds me of a Wit style with wheat malt and yeast in the nose. Maybe it's my imagination though. Also detect quite a bit of hops in the aroma and sweetness from the malt as well. This aroma is a big and bold one to be sure. I wasn't sure what an Imperial Pilsner would be like, but now it makes sense to me with the latest trend in super charged styles. Just double up on malt and hops and you've got an Imperial-fill in the blank brew. Body is really full and smooth. Flavor is also a strong one with sweet malt leading the way along with some hops blending in. This is a big beer and if you like big bold beers such as the Imperial class, you will like this one for sure. It's not a to style pils and doesn't claim to be one either. Enjoy it for what it is.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"

The palate is where the hops are to be found. The hops are very earthy and the palate is full and sweet, but not cloying. The finish is long rounded and a little alcoholic. One major flaw I find in the beer is a bit of diacetyl, which is a bummer. Overall, I really do not find this beer to be like a pils.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
807,"2004-01-02",3.6,"11/12/03.  Poured out of what I think was a 16.9 oz. white ceramic bottle, enjoyed in a tasting at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA 11/12/03.  Frothy, small white head.  Hazy gold-yellow body.  Aroma is grassy, earthy, yeasty, and pale malt.  Very crisp.  Flavor of strong bitter hops, lightly yeasty.  Some surprising dirty malt and a strong alcohol undertone.  A little shocking to the palate with the harshness there, but then the finish is rather quick.  It's still harsh but overall a pretty nice beer, and definitely one of the deeper, better pilseners I've had.  I totally agree with the IPA (or even Imperial IPA) comparisons, but I guess that's what you get from an Imperial Pilsener.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Notably meaty, musty, and vegetal and far less clean than it needs to be. Soft body with scant tiny bubbles. Fruity and sugary on first sip with notable hints of minty alcohol trailed by a bracing Sterling hop blitz.  Nearly cloying at times. Massive sweetness is momentarily tempered by the astounding hop bitterness. Finishes with a lemon zest, dried apricot, musty pilsner malt collaboration. Lingers with bready pilsner malts and numbing hop sensations. I was hoping for more juicy Sterlings in both the aroma and flavor, more perfume, and lots more dryness and effervescence to define the walloping bitterness. On a brighter note, this will certainly fulfill an evening hop fix.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Aromas right away are of the French Pilsner malts used in brewing this beer. Bready, yeasty, and slightly hoppy tasting. Resinous, piney hops in the middle compete with all the malts, but the malts win out in the end. No alcohol tastes that I can detect. Leaves malty burps in it's wake.
