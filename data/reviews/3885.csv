3885,"2017-06-20",3.0,"Can. 6.9%. Best before 31.12.17. Brewed in Berlin. Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow/golden, with a diminishing off-white head. Spotty lacing. Somewhat unbalanced aroma; hops, a bit cheesy; fruit, both overripe and regular; and slightly citrusy. Has a sort of cooked vegetables note to it as well. Flavour is fruity, citrusy. Light cheesy hops note. Spicy and cough drop hints as it warms. Bitter finish, lingering, along with a hop note, a mild alcohol burn and fledgling hints of rubber.

Aroma: not very intense aromas of grapefruit, grapes, passion fruit, citrus, tropical fruits. Subtle hints of pine, resin. Some malt background appeared as the beer was warming.

Flavor, again, presents a profound tropical bottom end, papaya, soft mango, sweet flowers, lime rind, canned tangerine, highly floral and, admittedly, beautiful complex linger with lime rind.  This, ultimately, is a step up from the original recipe, yet the absence of piney-ness has been replaced with hoppy resin (which is similar yet sometimes interchangeable).  This new version presents more tropical fruit than the other. A much more ""ripe"" flavor, but still wields the bitterness well and dryness too.  Impermanence is the beauty of life.

Great balance, and the creaminess of the body just rounds it out into a really great beer.

Original Rating 9/5/16: Tap at Bevog Festival. Pours a nice amber with a medium white head. But something?s pretty far off. A smell of whey overpowers what could be citrus fruit and resin. Taste is sour and overpoweringly bitter. Medium body, medium carbonation.

Malt profile is subdued on the tongue with those palate scraping hops dominating the flavour before a substantial dry lingering bitterness.

3885,"2016-01-19",4.3,"Kolor: Złoty. 100% klarowności. Dawno nie widziałem już tak czystego piwa. Przykładając palec z tylnej części szkła, można dokładnie zobaczyć linie papilarne przez szkło.
Piana: Biała, drobnoziarnista, średnio trwała.
Dobre krążkowanie na szkle.
Piana szeroko oplata ścianki pokala.
Duża jej częsć pływa po powierzchni.
Po zamieszniu znowu idzie do góry.
Zapach: Bardzo przyjemny, ale nie rzuca na kolana. Owoce tropikalne i cytrusowe: mango, marakuja, grejpfrut i mandarynki.
W oddali trochę ziołowych nut i konkretna porcja świeżej sosnowej żywicy, takiej ściekającej prosto z drzewa.
Smak: Tutaj to dopiero się dzieje. Każdy kto miał zastrzeżenia co do intensywności aromatu, będzie w 100% usatysfakcjonowany.
Piwo miażdży dosłownie smakiem!
Jakbym mógł to połknąłbym je od razu razem z pokalem.
Mamy tutaj plejadę owocową z grejpfrutem, pomarańczą, pomelo, mandarynką. Na drugiej półkuli słodkie, tropikalne owoce: mango i marakuja.
Żywiczno-sosnowe akordy dopełniają euforię smaku.
Delikatna słodowa baza świetnie współgra z chmielowym profilem piwa.
Ziołowe składowe amerykańskich chmieli doskonale współpracują z krótką, arcyprzyjemną goryczką.
Pijalność jest niebywała.
Mógłbym to pić dzień i noc. 
Wysycenie: Wysokie.
Podsumowanie:

To moje kolejne piwo z browaru Stone Brewing Co.
Dzięki uprzejmości koleżanki z pracy, która przywiozła mi je z Nowego Jorku miałem tą wjątkową przyjemność rozkoszowania się smakiem tego szczególnego IPA.
Przeniosłem się do świata wytrawnego West Coast IPA.
Nie będę skupiał się ani na pianie, ani na zapachu - smak tutaj jest spełnieniem największych marzeń o perfekcyjnym IPA.
Jest wyraźny, głęboki, trwały i niezapomniany.
Jakbym mógł to nie zmieniłbym tutaj nic.
Piwo jest warte każdej ceny. W Polsce ceny Stonea są bardzo wygórowane. W USA to piwo kosztuje ok. $3 i(w 12-pakach cena spada nawet do $1,7) można je kupić w wielu supermarketach.
Bardzo żałuje, że w Polsce tak ciężko je dostać:/","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Looks: Translucent orange honey colour; Three-quarter finger head and crumpety white foam which lasts for 2 minutes; Very good sticky lacing with quite fizzy small carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant Ale malt, with fresh lemon peel, orange, pineapples, grapefruits, floral, strong honey, pine, strong resin, yeast and sharp fresh grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet Ale malt, with very strong lemon peels, grapefruits, honey, light molasses, strong pine, very strong resin ooze, dry biscuits, yeast, very strong bitter hops and fresh cut grass.

Body: Close to medium body; Slick, creamy and very oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Very Ale-malty, even a moderate to light body cant hide its richness. Massive 2C attack with insanely strong fresh lemon peels and grapefruits, you cant get any fruiter and bitter than this! Resin ooze is just as intense but strangely quite without being overbearing as in most IIPAs. Biscuity yeast and strong grassy hops to round. Impressive!

Hoppiness: Excellent lemon, orange, pineapple, floral, honey and strong ooze in nose. Equally massive lemony resin fresh grass in taste. Bitterness is very strong yet tasty and match very well with the fruity resin for a lasting, very strong bitter fruity peel finish.

After Taste: Dry. Very oozy and nice strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: The Stone Cali Belgie I had previously gave me a hint of what to expect of this, but I am so surprised and satisfied by its intriguing hoppiness: the strong for strong sake idea on most craft IPAs and IIPAs does not apply here, as the strong 2Cs and magnum work together so well it bring refreshing fruitiness, just right resin and tasty strong bitterness. Such nice combination is very rare and this one nails it. This is my kind of strong IPA. Y-E-S!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

On the palate, more grapefruit and orange zest, orange flesh, green dank hops, a little pine and floral character.

A - Pours hazy orange with a nice frothy pillow of one and a half finger tall white head leaving light rings of lacing down the glass.


S - Smells of pungent hops; most notably citric and pine; sweet caramel malt, and some fruity esters. Good overall balance of sweet and bitter.


T - Starts off with a nice punch of pungent citric hops slowly giving way to a mix of sweet caramel malt, pine, and some fruity esters. I like how no one flavors dominates the others, it makes it very easy to drink. The finish has some light hop bitterness, lingering for a short period of time. This is one easy drinking, enjoyable, IPA.


M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Very smooth, crisp, feel with some lingering bitterness in the finish.

Bottle rating. Much better on tap. I love Stone but in a month of IPA drinking this didn't hold up in uniqueness and felt tamer than I recall on tap.

3885,"2014-06-18",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 5-27-12- 
Poured from growler into pint glass

Appearance  The brew pours a nice golden color, with a thin white head. The head fades rather fast and gives way to a very light amount of lacing.

Smell  The aroma is a nice mix of caramel, bread and a blend of citrus (mainly grapefruit in nature) and pine hop.

Taste  The taste starts out of sweeter caramel and a nice smooth bread flavor. There is a nice citrus hop present up front, that begins losing ground to some of the sweeter tastes more toward the middle of the tongue. While it temporarily loses ground in the middle, more toward the end it intensifies again and mixes with a pine flavor, which in the end, leaves a slightly sweet hop flavor on the tongue. It is quite pleasing.

Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is above average in creaminess and the carbonation is right about average. The carbonation is good for the exciting hop flavors, but the creaminess is good for the malty and sweet. Together it is a pleasant feel. 

Overall  A nice easy drinking IPA. Its not over the top in hop, or lacking either. It is a good session IPA.","","Darkmagus82"

But in the end, it?s the original, the meter by which all other IPAs are measured.Nose is ripe, resiny hop, cut-grass, bready malt, some sourness, and a lingering waft of orange citrus. Balanced heaviness in mouthfeel and tingly carbonation give way to sticky hop, biscuits, and bright citrus flavors that build and linger on the tongue. Alcohol is not upfront but shows up in the profile as the glass gets lower. While I could apply a myriad of exacting critiques - i.e its very sharp in flavor and not necessarly right for drinking on the reg - it?s a real classic.

Medium bodied, subdued carbonation welcomed, resiny on the body lending an almost oily texture.
Intensely hoppy on the body; once again resiny, woody, sharp citrus. Malt makes an appearance as a light golden syrup, biscuit character, providing some sort of relief. Bitterness firm but balanced, lingering grassy character.

3885,"2014-01-26",0.5,"Stones IPA, to me, represents everything wrong with the current beer trend. One day, people will look back at this obsession with hops and realize what a bizarre palate people in this day and age. 

Thats not to say hops are bad. No. But, excessive bittering hops, without any counter balance, are. And, Stone IPA, to me, represents that extreme. It comes off with this nasty medicinal bittering taste akin to aspirin. There is also this strong after taste that lingers on the palate for days. I couldnt get rid of that aspirin like linger on my palate even days after finishing off a Stone multipack. It was just nasty, and I vowed to swear off Stone forever. Contrast this with more floral IPAs such as Pliny the Elder or Simtra triple IPAs. With these brews, there is a more floral, sweet aroma and taste that finishes very clean and dry. Very little after taste. The predominant use of simcoe and amarillo hops gives those beers their characteristic aromatic hoppy smells and tastes that, I think, isnt emphasized enough nowadays in the single IPA.","","mililani"

3885,"2014-01-04",3.6,"I had a comparative tasting with one of my friends who isnt used to craft beer of the Stone Pale Ale vs the Stone IPA, the bottles were from Antenna America. I would have thought the IPA would have been darker but it is a deep gold while the pale ale is an orange copperish hue. The aroma is biscuit with herbal & floral hoppy notes while the IPA has more of a citrus & tropical fruit aroma. Taste wise the pale ale has a simple clean bitter lemon profile with a solid malt backbone. The flavor of the IPA is more complex with different fruits popping through lemon, lime, grapefruit, peach & maybe pine in the aftertaste. The malts are hardly in evidence but it is a solid IPA. One thing to be said is both of these beers were best before the end of November-still damn tasty though. Once they warmed up the IPA became more cohesive with pine notes coming through, meanwhile the pale ale got mellow with more caramel nicely counterbalancing the citrusy hops & making the beer appear less acidic. Definitely a more put together flavor profile once they warm up, strangely enough the beers we liked best changed based on serving temperature. Cold from the fridge the pale ale won out but at a higher temperature the IPA was our preferred drink.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

3885,"2013-12-08",3.7,"(Bottle): Pours amber with a slight haze, white head. Aroma of grapefruit, oranges, peaches, lemon zest, malt, slight honey. Flavour is very citrus forward with a big sweet malty / biscuit base. Lemon zest, grapefruit, pine, resin notes. Bitterness seems more than 70 IBUs and it lingers long after the finish.

3885,"2013-12-05",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2013 Double Dry hopped @ the brewery version:
Scored at brewery one week ago.

Nice honey amber ale wit ha couple fingers of soapy white foam and gauzy lace. Excellent clarity. Nose is grapefruit, peppercorn, honey, pine, a hint of mango and some resin. Flavor is nice and bitter with a solid biscuit malt profile and some nice resiny flavors. There is a bit of tangerine and pine in here as well. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a wet, yet cloying finish. Nice beer.

Bottle review:

Bb: 5/18/11

A: Pours a honey ale with exceptional clarity with a two finger head of off-white blossoming head which dissipates slowly to leave a thick sheet of the same. Spotty lacing.

S: Pine, resin, mostly dominate the nose here. some medium grain and caramel tones. Lightest hints of mint and cotton candy. Decent.

T: Balanced. Super balanced. I dont believe this beer is super fresh, but the hops have died out a bit the beer is dominated by a healthy malt backbone and early hopping bitterness. Nearly good, but now, above average.

M: Medium body, and medium to light carb. Good feel. Leaves mouth with little reminder that it was just there.

O: Very drinkable. I wouldnt call this beer great, but I could likely drink all night, and thats a sign of a quality flagship beer, as this is.

3885,"2013-06-15",3.6,"Pours clear,  amber/orange with a good size head of white foam that fell almost reasonably to a thick cap; leaving some monstrously stubborn lace. Nose is big with lemon, floral and herbal, citrus, lime and a nice soft spice under all the fruit. Not a lot of malt on the nose. Just a hint of bread and some caramel sweetness. As it warms the lemon sweetens deeply and so does the caramel. Taste is colossal. Fruit washes over the palate a bit too quickly and meets a heavy resin for a bitter that starts mid palate. Bread shows up in back with some light biscuit right before an oily pine blast. Finishes slick with a powerful bitter that lasts long into a finish that isnt really dry as much as pithy and sour. Body is thin and while the malt constantly approaches it never rounds out and so this leaves a touch imbalanced Moderate to low carbonation. 

This was a strong, beer that grows on you as you drink. I didnt find the same cocky personality in this that I have found in other Stone beers and I think I missed that. I also think that the fruit character suffered in the attempt to make it intensely bitter without provoking it sufficiently first. The malt came out more and more to show that it was indeed stronger than you might have  realized. The hop character engaged you more and more as well as the expansive bitter just kept unfolding and at the end of the bottle I was mysteriously satisfied.","New York, USA","pinkie"

Lovely fruity hoppy aroma, refreshing, and uplifting. Orange, small frothy head. Nice full palate, smooth, but pleasant carbonation. Alas a slightly mashy crystalmalt-like taste, a little sticky. Citrussy hops dance around the back of the mouth, and finally the sticky resiny bitterness kicks in, to join the dots. That late finish is just pure resiny bitteness, a touch fruity, and very nice.

3885,"2013-03-12",3.9,"Best before April 30, 2013.
Appearance: The body is crystal clear with an amber hue, carbonation is showing in the body. The head is a light tan, not short or tall, with good retention. The head settles to a creamy coating covering the top.
Aroma: At first I picked up a lot of piney and grapefruit bitterness on the aroma, on second thought I get some sweet orange with floral touches, a bit of spice. Lots of hops, this is complex with good strength.
Taste: The hops take the flavor here providing an assertive grapefruit and pine bitterness with a malt base there just to balance out the bitterness. This is a classic IPA, no frills but great to drink.
Palate: Creamy body with soft carbonation.
Overall: This is a great IPA. Theres no fault I can really find in this, Im just not in love with the hop choices since I prefer a more tropical flavor. This is good though, just a bit pricey.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Fresh hop and sweet grass mix with grapefruit and pineapple and theres an earthiness that really puts this over the top for me.

3885,"2013-02-16",4.3,"Oh man. Here we go. Its rumble time. Im pouring six IPAs tonight, into two identical tulip glasses so I can compare, with this one going head to head with Two Hearted Ale by Bells. The two american IPAs, both with 100/100 on ratebeer. Damn, this ought to be fun. Stone is No 2/6, Two hearted, no 3/6. 

 This one went head to head with Titan IPA earlier and this was the conclusion: Titan is livelier than stone, stone has more of a malty background while titan is a bit more hop forward, but really tough call. Both are epic. Stone wins on aroma, really nice floral and citrus hop, but titan wins on taste. Both cases barely. As much as it pains me to say so I call a tie. You cant go wrong with either of these.

But time for the rumble. Bottle pours on each into identical tulips. Aroma of stone is nice and floral, but Two hearted wins the category. Dont get me wrong, the citrus and glorious honey and hop aroma of stone is great but it has to go up against the two hearted, and two hearteds balanced hop aroma wins. In taste Stone IPA is more hoppy, citrus and floral, but Two hearted is more balanced. Two hearted though just is so unbelievably smooth with all the citrus hops coming through still that I have to give it the category. Two hearteds finish is better as well. Im calling it for Two hearted here. Both are epic, but in a battle of heavyweights the two hearted wins. On to the next!","","neontb"

I really wanted to see what notes this beer would release if I let it sit and warm up for a few minutes. This turned out to be a good idea.

Aroma: Immediate hops, grapefruit on the front; warmth reveals pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, light malty finish.

Taste: BITTER, right into tropical fruits, light maltiness, then into a lingering hoppy, crisp, bitter, astringent, maybe a little spicy or cereal finish.

I was finally able to sit down with this one for a review. Quite a tasty West Coast type IPA; I was pleasantly surprised with the tropical fruit aromas and flavors, but this batch, at least, tends to stay on the bitter side. Definitely something to keep around the house.","Michigan, USA","TheSack"

3885,"2012-05-31",3.6,"The logo for this San Diego brewery is a gargoyle, those eerie stone creatures one sees perched along the roofs of great cathedrals, where they serve as rain spouts. Why? This is unimportant; what is important is that Stone produces great craft brew; this IPA is one of the best.

It begins in a luxuriant froth, spongy and shimmering, and slowly subsides beneath the glass rim, forming a sudsy crown atop a cloudy pool of gold. The nose detects faint whiffs of apple supplemented by myriad notes of butter. 

However, the action occurs on the palate; there is an initial citrus explosion, containing various shards of lime and orange, which fades in a quick, but intense, bitterness provided by the generous dry hopping. Pleasant well-balanced mouthfeel brings to close a satisfying quaff and an important reminder of how great craft brew should taste. Still, you gotta love them gargoyles.","Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA","Pivoyager"

3885,"2012-04-25",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2013 Definitely hoppy as advertised.  Didnt find it as citrusy as some have claimed, and would have liked a little more malt to balance the hops, but still very good.  Prefer their double IPA, Ruination, which is in my top 5 all-time beers.  May re-rate: bumping this up a little.  Citrus hits more now that its been in my fridge for about a week.  Super crisp finish.  Just let this one rest and get very cold for awhile - itll wow you more.  Ruination is still incomparable, but this is a great single IPA like most others seem to think.  Yet another re-rate: I have yet to be very impressed by their aroma, which still stays an above average 7 in my view - other testers have agreed with me.  Not even as citrusy as Bells.  Lighter bodied like Bells, but much more bitter, if that is what you are after.  I still desperately want more malt to go with this - taking down from 8 to 7.  I like bitter, but I like bitter WITH malts!  Lingers nicely, yes, but - malt!  Bring the malt!  I first rated this 3.5, then 3.7, now 3.6.

3885,"2012-04-09",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2013 Re-review from 3/16 ^_^ 12 oz bottle poured into a regular glass.

A: Pours a faintly hazy golden amber color. The head is a two finger offwhite shade that retains itself nicely.

S: Not really my bag here. Its mostly some earthy dankness, pine cone, mild grapefruit, with a bit of augmenting caramel malt. I prefer big tropical fruit bomb aromas, so its not the fault of the brew itself.

T: Better than I remembered. The initial flavor is pleasant grapefruit, before giving way to a bitter, dry piny finish. Malts are only vaguely evident throughout. Quite good, even great.

M: Dry and astringent - bitter, too. Theres nothing balanced or delicate about the mouthfeel, but it gives the beer impressive drinkability in conjunction with the lighter texture and moderate carbonation. Still, it would be even better if the bitter dryness didnt fatigue the palate so badly.

O: I keep writing off Stone, and there are many occasions when Im right in doing so. This one, though, Im thankful I revisited. I wouldnt quite make it a go-to - theres far too big of a risk of getting a stale bottle here on the right coast - but I would revisit this on tap, easily.

A very hazy golden color, with a bubbly, rocky head. Decent retention, and nice lace stick.

The aroma is full of floral and herbal hops. Surprising spicy aroma. 

No real malt presence in the flavor, we go straight the a strong hop taste. I really enjoy the herbal spiciness that protrudes and stays through the whole sip. There is still a nice sweetness here. Strong hop bitterness during the sip, and the aftertaste is quite bitter as well. 

One thing I will never say about a Stone Brew is that it is not smooth, and this is no exception. Medium carbonation, but with a strong taste it drinks with a medium / full body.

West coast ultra hopped tastiness. Not for the faint of palette. It would be natural to think a beer this hoppy would not be drinkable. Stone is insulted by that way of thinking, dont let it happen again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Nice constant nucleation and the glass is perfectly beer clean. Aroma is just pure, beautiful, West Coast hop. So fresh and crisp. Citrus and pine in balance.

My benchmark IPA, and one the only good beer they sell at the gas station down the street.  Aroma is a nice skunky IPA, more sour than the average pour.  Orange-y appearance with a circle of foamy dots that usually float to the top.  At first sip, youre hit with a strong, smoky taste with a sour (but refreshing) aftertaste.  Its not a sesh beer, but its got a body that I would put at medium-full with a very sticky texture.  I can drink a few at a time; not sure about everybody else.  A sixer at once and I imagine I would be either passed out at Jack in the Box or over a toilet.

3885,"2011-07-13",4.0,"Having sampled many of Stones offerings in the past, Im finally getting the chance to try their IPA.  

This is a 22 ounce bomber that Im pouring into a goblet.  The appearance is hazy, and it almost looks like there is some yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle.  I didnt think that Stone bottle conditioned but maybe Im wrong.  Color is a deep golden yielding to copper.  Head is minimal but it has gorgeous lacing.  

Not surprisingly, hops dominate the nose.  This is an IPA, after all, and a West-coast style one, to boot.  Fruity citrus hops dominate, followed by floral and musty pine.  In the background theres this wonderful hint of malt caramel sweetness.  Often you get an IPA with muted hop character, and thats certainly not the case here.  The smell on this is just so crisp and fresh  a sure sign that this is a very fresh IPA and one thats been treated with care.  

The first taste showcases a nice level of carbonation, and moderate bitterness that isnt overpowering.  Having had Ruination in the past, its nice to get a beer from Stone that actually attempts to maintain some semblance of balance.  Taste has a nice residual sweetness to it, including in the finish.  Its easy to finish IPAs with bitterness, but this, surprisingly, seems to go more towards the sweet side.  That said the body of the beer is light, dry, and refreshing.  Lots of flavor for something that goes down so easily.  The label says 6.9% ABV but the alcohol is never apparent.  

Stone gets a lot of praise for the other beers that they produce, but this is an underrated example of the West-Coast IPA style.  Its a little bit light in body, but this lends to easy drinking.  The hop profile and underrated malt backbone make this beer a winner.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

3885,"2011-04-14",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2011 Stone India Pale Ale: Drank out of a tumbler
Pour: The color comes out to be a pretty nice yellow/orange. The beer forms a massive head, somewhere around 4 fingers, that is pretty much white in color and lingers for awhile. It looks like there is a nice creamy top to the head with larger bubbles around the sides. 
Aroma: I absolutely love the aroma of this beer. Orange and citrus are the most prominent smells I get, along with some pine characteristics. The smell of hops really provides a backbone to the aroma but still the star is the citrus. The smell just leaves my mouth watering in anticipation. 
First Taste: You actually dont get as a much citrus taste in it as I would have expected from the aroma. You definitely still do get those nice citrus notes in the taste but what you really notice is the hops, which is indicative of an ipa. Its like the citrus has its time in the spot light for the preshow then the hops get to shine in the main event. Its definitely a great well balanced taste but really doesnt have the same punch behind it like I was expecting it to, which I sort of enjoy that fact.  If you are a real big hop head then you might think this beer needs a bit more of a wallop but I enjoy the nice balance. The finish is a little bread like with just a tiny bit of deep bitterness that doesnt last too long. I very refreshing and thirst quenching drink.
Overall I did enjoy this beer a lot and am now looking forward to its brother the ruination. A nice Ipa from the guys (and gals?) at the Stone brewing company.","Texas, USA","adayale"

Pours into my american pint glass with a nice gold color and a foamy and rocky white head that takes a bit to recede leaving gobs of lacing.

It has a decent smell though not overly intense. It is very citrusy and zesty with also some herbal grassiness. There isnt much malt to the scent of this beer.

It is smooth and hoppy with a good amount of biscuity malt backing and a nice bitter finish. Luscious but insanely drinkable. This is the quintessential quaffing IPA.

The mouthfeel is nice and medium bodied. This stuff is so easy to put back, it is like drinking water, far higher drinkability than a light beer especially when it is nice and warmed up.

Overall a great pick for American IPA if you want a superb quaffing beer.

4.0 A: Vibrant orange in color. A little hazy, as if it were bottle-conditioned, but I dont think it is. Not a lot of head, even with a semi-aggressive pour. Decent amount of lacing considering the lack of head.

5.0 S: My my my, this is screaming deliciousness at me. Big citrus hop aroma followed by spice and fruity esters. Sweetness and bitterness marry as if you hybridized an orange with a grapefruit.

4.5 T: A lot of hop flavor, maybe even more than hop bitterness. Im loving it. Grassy, citrusy, woody hops make up this flavor. Theres a sweet and sour fruitiness and a biscuity character from the malts. Very good hop/malt balance.

4.5 M: Medium body, creamy as all hell. Very nicely done.

The beer pours a nice hazy yellow with a large to medium sized head and quite a good deal of lace.  The aroma is fruity with some orange zest, light cooking spice, the aroma is quite nice but doesnt pack the pungency of many IPAs of this flavor caliber
The flavor is grapefruit and melon... this sits pretty nicely with me as these are decidedly my two favorite flavors in the repertoire of new world hops. The beer is bitter in that way that keeps you wanting to drink more of it. It might just be that I really like this kind of bitterness, but it almost seems like more of a sensation after a while than a flavor. This delivers the balance between dryness and fruity hops as well as two hearted, in a way the two almost seem akin in their character.

It looks like the advertisement photos you see. A nice golden orange with a beautiful pillow of a white head on top. As you consume the brew the lace just follows the beer down the glass.

If you want to experience one out here in the east this is the one I would point you too. The flavor is bitter grapefruit with almost no malt profile in it at all.

As far as taste goes, first you get a good hop bite, with very apparent grapefruit notes and a hint of orange. Then sweetness, breadiness, and bitterness come in all at once. The finish is bitter and bready, with a little tartness. Very tasty!

Light-to-medium body to it. Not very carbonated. Quite dry in the mouth, though. A little spiciness from the hops can be felt on the tongue. A little hint of alcohol.

Pretty good drinkability, however, I wouldnt make this my session IPA, because of its dryness and its ABV. Goes down smooth at first, but then it may become more challenging to drink, especially if youre not a hophead.

Poured into a goblet. One finger wide head settles to a thin film over a hazy light golden beer. 

Smell: Light solvent alcohol, pine, and citrus. My nose is not good enough yet to distinguish which ones. Not as potent as the ruination I had a few days ago.

Taste: Just as an IPA should be, this one is hoppy but also balanced with the malts. The balance is very good. The finish is longish with the carbonation perfect, not too fizzy

Mouthfeel: This one is probably a great example of how an IPA should feel. The body is not too heavy, and combined with the flavors, makes for a very tasty beverage.

Drinkability: If I could get these on a regular basis, I would. This is a very good IPA.

3885,"2010-07-13",3.6,"12oz bottle. Man, this is so controversial, but this has to be the first Stone beer I really wasnt that blown away by... Its one of the classics, and I still hadnt had a chance to try it, so I had to give it a go. I have a feeling this could have been a slightly old bottle, or maybe just an off bottling, so I have given it the benefit of the doubt and will definitely give it another go if I get another chance. Pours out deep golden with a dense off-white head which rests well for a time then dissipates. Aroma is very citrusy with lots of grapefruit and resinous earthy notes - reminds me of Jaipur or maybe Punk. So far so good, but the flavour was a bit weird, a lot of soapy notes, even a mild detergenty character, then some more citrus and lots of earthy hops, finish is bitter, but not necessarily pleasant... More odd soap notes. All in all a little upset as I love stone, and Im sure this is normally a great beer, but in this case this was not that pleasant.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

This Stone IPA was my favorite of the 4. I drank each bottle on a different night. I drank them early evening at the Jersey Shore sitting by the ocean. I drank each one in stages so I could test the change is taste and aroma as the beers became less chilled. Right out of the bottle, the beer had a strong positive aroma that created anticipation that this was going to be one great beer. I drank it in a tall pilsner glass and it looked beautiful against the backdrop of the sun going down over the ocean. The beer appeared darker at the bottom and then gradually lighter as the beer filled the glass. As I drank it, I realized this was one great beer. As noted, my favorite of these four. As I drank the beer throughout the evening, the aroma and taste seemed to get even better as the beer became less chilled. The taste that stayed on the palate was awesome. I rated this beer perfect as it struck me as my perfect beer. So overall, I see this as a beer I would store in my beer frig on a regular basis.","Marlton, New Jersey, USA","PapaSteve54"

3885,"2010-06-28",3.7,"Growler fill from the brewery.  I go back a long way with this beer and remember it being the hoppiest beer Id ever had about 12 years ago.  Glad to say that it can still hold its own against the plethora of IPAs out on the market.  Pours a bright orange with a nicely lacing white collar of froth. Nose is hoppy, but not as pungent as I remember from my early days.  I get mostly pine from the aroma, but there is some grapefruit lurking there as well.  The flavor is all about the hops with a subdued malt bill.  Needless to say this one is bitter and definitely a little lopsided.  My guess is that this has a ton of Chinook serving as the backbone.  Has just enough of a malt backbone to keep it from being like alcoholic grapefruit juice.  Mouthfeel is relatively light to showcase the hops and the texture is oily and resinous with a persistent carbonation.  Ends with a dry bitter bite that lingers on the tongue.  Not my favorite anymore, but still a classic.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

Let down by the slightly crude sweetness - maybe youre supposed to drink it colder (but then it would surely be quite unbalanced).[3.5] [11/11]Much colder this time (about 8C) and it does work rather better - the malt platform now registers as an adequate platform for the hop show (but contributes little).

Thick and heavily hopped. Has a fizzy consistency that bounces off the tongue. Not a light beer, by any stretch. But highly drinkable.

3885,"2010-04-30",4.2,"One of the most interesting things Ive discovered since venturing into the world of beer-reviewing is the fact many beers can have a flavor that is reminiscent of a certain ingredient even though the brewer has not added it to the recipe. For example, many German wheat beers have a banana and spice taste, but neither are added. In the case of American India pale ales like Stone IPA, many taste like grapefruit, but the beer contains no juice whatsoever.Stone IPA is packed full of flavor with a seemingly distinct taste of grapefruit. Whats odd is the beers taste is more accurately described as sweet than tart. Still, its a delicious beer even if it isnt your usual IPA.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAPoured from a 22oz bomber, this beer flows a little rough but eventually evens out. It produces a bright orange/dark amber body which is rather hazy (although I didnt see any sediment). The carbonation is low, and the head is well-proportioned, white, foamy and creamy. The aroma is to die for with a strong, sweet and yet light fragrance of flowers and citrus. The hops are just calling out to be drunk!TASTEWhat puts some people off about IPAs is their intense hop bite, and even though Stone IPA is quite the hoppy its actually not as intense as you might think. Like any quality beer of this style the presence of hops is definitely noticeable immediately, but the beer finishes with a sweet, refreshing and slightly watery taste of citrus. There isnt much of a hop bite here; in fact, the flavor in the end is rather dry. The brewerys website states it is dry-hopped for two weeks to get the extra bitterness. While I would agree that this beer is certainly bitter, I found it to be more sweet than tart. It has a candy-like taste which is very pleasing, and thankfully no sugary aftertaste. Still, I was a little surprised this beer was more citrusy than it was hoppy, since it was crisp, clean and refreshing, rather than an all-out assault on the palate (hey, when a beer has a picture of a demon on the label, its rather ominous dont you think?). FINISHStone IPA is much smoother than youd expect. There is a faint dryness to the finish, but no aftertaste or scouring effect on your tongue. The sweet taste and slightly watery body make it very drinker-friendly.BODYThe Stone Brewing Company has a reputation for making [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ beers that are for true connoisseurs only. Although their IPA is rather heavy at 6.9% ABV and 77 IBUs, its amazing as just how light and easy this beer is on your system. This is a case where the numbers lie, since this beer drinks like something much more pedestrian and would work well as a session beer rather than a one-and-done drink.FINAL THOUGHTSId say this is definitely an outstanding beer and one of the best American examples of the India Pale Ale style. However, I think Stone (much like Rogue) goes to show the distinct difference between beers brewed on the East Coast versus the West Coast. If you want intense hop bitterness opt for Dogfish Head. If you want something lighter and sweet, opt for Stone  you wont be sorry.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOv35yP6J-8","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3885,"2010-04-21",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 24, 2010 Stone week sampler at Finnegans, Plainfield. This is the Double Dry Hopped IPA, for those keeping score. Deceptively pale Bud color, but for a bit of haze. Some clingy lace. Smell is another boxing glove stuffed with hops straight from the homebrew store. Just hoppus in extremis, that gets in the way of a malty beer.
Regular IPA from 12 oz. bottle, $1.79 @ Binnys. Im breaking my beer fast after a week on antibiotics. Again, a light golden pour, but notably hazy. Kicks up a big slightly orange head of foam. In my beer-starved state, I find the citrusy, resiny hop smell to be strangely warming, the malts inviting. Taste has some dried hop to it, a little rough as befits dry-hopping and quite welcome after two weeks without. So I can bump it up a few notches from the Double Dry Hopped draft (was 6-3-7-4-13 for 3.3). Not as smooth and chewy as Alpha King or Two Hearted, and clearly they dont care.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3885,"2010-04-21",3.4,"A- Transparent medium amber body. An aggressive pour only produced a head of 1 finger. The tiny bubbles constantly rising to the top (which is great because Im drinking this from a standard pint glass) give this one a decent head retention. Eventually a thin collar remains and no lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Wonderful bouquet of citrus, floral, and earthy hops with a sweet caramel malt backbone.

T- A balance of herbal and citrus hop taste upfront with a weak caramel malt backbone. The finish is mostly herbal hops with a caramel malt sweetness. Lingering bitterness is aggressive and somewhat unpleasant. Also lingering is an herbal hop taste, caramel malt sweetness, and alcohol warmth.

P- Aggressive carbonation and oily body of medium thickness.

O- This is a decent IPA but not one of my favorites. I was surprised that the alcohol was detected in this medium ABV brew. This one is full of hop flavor and bitterness. I may revisit this one again.

The malt backbone is there and provides just enough sweetness to express the hops at their finest, keeping the bitterness pleasant. Creamy, sudsy, oily with hops.

3885,"2010-03-12",3.5,"12 oz bottle from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, served in an English pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden colour with a small white head that fades quickly leaving slight lace. Aroma is pungent high-alpha hops: big citrus dripping with pine resin. Notes of biscuit malts are also present, but subservient to hops. Flavour begins with moderate malt sweetness, but hops quickly take over, building towards a big grapefruit finish that is intensely bitter. Light in body with a dry texture and soft carbonation. Finish is mildly astringent. Overall, an intensely hoppy, intensely bitter IPA. While I enjoy big IPAs, this one is one-dimensional: malts are sparse and have virtually no depth. Inadequate for such enormous hops. Even the hops are quite simple: a more complex blend would have made for a much better beer. 2010-03-08","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

I was hoping this time would be different and it is a very good IPA but just not on the level of a Lagunitas, Green Flash or even the Sierra Nevada Torpedo which I really enjoy.

What can you say that hasnt already been said about Stone IPA, the king, the quintessential IPA, the baseline standard by which all other IPAs are to be judged.  I am a complete and total IPA addict and it was Stone that irst got me into IPAs when I moved to California.  Since then, Ive broadened my IPA horizons and my palate is a bit more mature.  Still, you can never go wrong with Stone IPA.  So simple, but maybe that is what makes it great.  When I think of hops, I think of Stone.

When I wasnt seeking out hoppy beers on a regular basis, I used to say it smelled to me like new carpet. At this point I dont even really detect that any more. Just a fruity orange refreshing aroma, piney and musty sure, but no rugs. For me the Stone is still a little underbalanced, slightly thin and unrepentantly bitter.

Slight caramel and biscuit malt help to make the hops not overpowering. Nonetheless, hops dominate and create perhaps one of the finest hop flavors in any beer Ive ever had.

This rating based on a growler fill from the brewery.  Pours a somewhat light golden amber color with a decent white head.  Mild hop aroma (mostly floral, but also a bit of citrus and pine) is a bit weaker than most California IPAs.  Also aroma of brewed black tea and a distinct grainy-ness that it not altogether good.  Flavor is decidedly better as the hops kick in more (bitter citrus and pine) with a decent malt backbone.  I think the bottled version may be better.  Have I just gotten overly used to this?  Its good, but when it comes to local IPAs here in San Diego, I much prefer the Alesmith.","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Out of bottle this golden-amber ale has light opacity and a frothy off-white head. Smell is hop-dominated with a sweet blossom and light citrus character. After several sips one can identify oranges, tangerines, light caramel malt, subtle orange zest, guava, sweet floral undertones and a hoppy finish. Body is shockingly light ad crisp.

Greapefruit is subtle yet strong with slight floral notes and mild caramel malt. Thats what Im talkin about...overall citrus is dominant but not one-sided - aroma has Beautiful Chemistry in spades.

Caramel malt comes forward in an even keel. Hoppiness manifests itself in more of a bitter citrus tone than on the nose...with a little warmth theres solid balance but the citrus and malt do quiet down rather quickly.

This achieves almost perfect balance on the palate. Malt is clean but hearty and hops provide ample bitterness and citrus. Finish is strong and even-keeled. Husky but bright. Never gets old.

One of the most drinkable beers around in my opinion and my favorite beer to drink all-around. Excellent for all seasons - hearty enough for cold, light enough for warm. Quenches thirst and provides a strong but clean flavor profile.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

The aroma has the standard smells but they are straight up better - mild pine and grapefruit, slight spice, floral, background caramel malts: the beauty of this is that the aroma is not over the top - its just excellent.

3885,"2009-04-28",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2012 On tap at DLD 09.  Im not really sure why I was so skeptical about this one going into trying, but it absolutely blew me away.  I had already tried quite a few world class before trying it, so maybe I was alittle overly happy from the day of drinking quality beer, but the entire time drinking this, I wasnt sure if I was just imagining how good this beer really was.  Ill have to re-rate sometime, but at that moment, this is what I had:

The aroma definitely leans toward the hoppy side, but never theres never too much.  Enticing smells to perfection.  Just so many different hop notes with floral bouquets, citrus, grapefruit, melons, earth, and all of it coming together brilliantly.  A backing aroma of basic yet pleasant caramels and pale malts that are exactly what the beer needed.  Probably the only weakness I can see in this beer is in its appearance, only because of the lighter looking body, otherwise, still very appealing with good sized creamy froth head, mild carbonation, great lacing and retention the whole way, and golden tangerine in color.  I know my friends thought I was crazy when i first started drinking this, but golly! I really couldnt believe how it tasted.  The hoppy bitterness is just impossible to beat.  Just too complex and it works too well.  Citrus grapefruits, mixed citrus, melons, and earth galore.  Again, like the aroma, just the perfect backing of basic, but great quality malts with caramels and pales.  The bitter then just lasts, and lasts, and lasts in the finish.  Incredible! Too good to be true!","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

The assertively dry bitterness runs away a bit over the initial mellowness, which maybe just calls for salty buttery snacks or cuts of fine charcuterie. I love the subtle aromatic tones along with that bitterness. No... you dont understand, Ive just never had any beer like this particular India Pale. THIS is the American IPA.

Appearance: Its clear, medium gold with a tall white head.   The head crashed quickly leaving thick lacing in the glass (gorgeous).

Flavor: Its a hop forward taste.  The initial bitter bite carries through the tasting experience.  I can taste the malt, but the flavor is balanced towards the hops. 
 
Mouth feel: It has a medium body

Overall Impression:   This is definitely an IPA; the hops smack me in the taste buds.  I was surprised aroma was not stronger (the hops seem muted) until I looked at the Enjoy By date and it read 03/31/09.  This was a bit surprising as I purchased the beer in mid-March (09).

3885,"2009-03-24",3.8,"A dazzling sunset of golden orange hues is topped by scattered clouds of white fluff which refuse to secede to the setting sun which fills my glass. Rays of her bouquet tickle my nose, bursting into a bouquet of orange, melon, nectarines, lemon, grapefruit, wet hop oils and grass. Sprinkles of joy dance in the apple of my eye which has been wholly captivated by the Stone IPA. Romantic illusions aside, how she tastes could make or break our union and with faint trepidation, I take deeply of her nectar. Sparkling bright with a body that immediately sticks to and coats all open surfaces. Orange nectar and nectarine juice linger while lemon and cut grass revitalize my tastebuds. Succulent summer melon creeps into her palate while my mouth waters after each drying finish. She is a perfectly played one-two punch of delicate sweetness followed by a strong crisp bitter hop presence while a hint of toasty malts support her performance from the shadows. Each mouth-watering quaff shortens our time together, shared by bitter-sweet sticky memories of orange, melon, hop oils and pine, lemon and grapefruit. Highly sessionable, my glass has long been empty while only pleasant memories remain.


Stone is now three-for-three in the success department, but I expected no less. I wouldnt go so far as to say I have a 6th sense for beers, and maybe I do, but that many Stone fanatics cant be wrong.

3885,"2009-02-07",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2012 [Bottle] Pours bright hazy orange with a small white head. Stone usually does a good job with big, hoppy aromas, and although this isnt their best example of it, it is still enjoyable. It does fade after the initial blast, but there is still a lot of citrus (especially lemon zest), honey, some malt and a strange herbal scent. The taste was really not as bitter as I had expected. There was grapefruit in the finish, but that was after some solid malt, and a strange semi-sweetness that I couldnt identify. Meium mouthfeel with a long, dry finish. Not bad. A very solid, clean, well made IPA that did not blow me away, but was fairly impressive nonetheless. Old rating: 7/3/8/4/15=3.7Re-rate: Still a pretty solid beer. The taste is surprisingly hot, quite bitter, and then an unusual blend of melon and papaya, with lots of lemon drop hard candy towards the end, before finishing with barley. Surprisingly thick mouthfeel, smooth, fairly long finish. Overall, enjoyable, but doesnt hide its alcohol very well. Drinks more like a IIPA, and not something Id want to sit down and have multiple pints of.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

3885,"2008-10-24",3.9,"In short: A well-balanced highly drinkable IPA focusing on citrusy and resinous elements.
How: Bottle + tap many times.  This rating for a fresh 12oz bottle consumed a few days after purchase.  Drank side-by-side with the Stone Ruination IPA just for the fun of it
The look: Clear dark golden body topped by an initially large off-white head with medium retention and leaving excellent lacings
In long: Nose of citrus fruits with light pine-needles juicy notes.  More citrusy than the Ruination.  Taste proposes sweet maltiness with a 1/3 honey and 2/3 caramel flavour.  Finish is citrusy with resinous elements and the bitterness is not overwhelming like in the Stone Ruination IPA.  Some inherent spiciness in the hops reminding me of the Stone Pale Ale.  Im actually pretty sure the hopping of the Stone IPA has a lot in common with that of the Stone Pale Ale  This one is not as intense, as bitter or as dry as the Stone Ruination IPA but it really is better balanced.  Funny thing is despite all this I slightly prefer the totally unbalanced Ruination IPA.  IPAs are not girlfriends, being well balanced is not mandatory.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

I had to re-review this to be fair. The only hop presence seems to be a very strong bitterness. Maybe I got a bad bottle but this sure was a disappointing IPA and I used to really like it.

12 oz bottle which I poured into a ruination mug. The color is dark yellow and almost clear. The smell is wonderful but not overwhelming. I think I can smell grapefruit, but better than grapefruit (cause I don’t like grapefruit). The taste is slightly bitter and the mouthfeel is pleasant. This beer goes down way too easy and that is why it is one of my favorites. This is yet another winner from the good folks down in San Diego.

Aroma is floral citrusy, powerful for an IPA.

Initial wasn’t as bitter as expected, but largely citrusy and sweet, lacking a defining malt character. Light bodied. Perhaps this has been on the shelf long enough to take away some of the hop bite.

The malts are sure present, but overpowered by the hops. That continues in the flavor, theres a lovely hoppyness, pine and citrus, its quite fruity, and theres still room for the malt. Full-bodied, quite sweetish, and it finishes with the same flavors it has initially. Lovely and easy to drink. Dangerously easy to drink. (080626)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

Nose is all fruity, citrusy, piney floral hoppiness, with a deep character - I rather like the ""cold steel"" comment below - theres that sort of clean robustness to it. Good medium body that suits the style. The hops dominate the flavor, as you would expect in a good IPA. Strong, crisp bitterness that finishes very dry and lingers for a long time on the palate.

3885,"2008-05-30",4.1,"12oz and 22oz bottles, and on tap.
So if you cant tell by all the rave reviews and the top-5 ranking, this ones a Classic.  Here are my opinions after many many tastings...
Appearance: Clear, golden amber; frothy head, lively; looks clean and fresh.
Aroma: good hoppy citrus and pine needles with other less cliche things like under-ripe strawberries, herb gardens on a summer morning, and cold steel.
Flavor: west coast hops in the foreground with nice pale malts in the background -- remeniscent of homemade grapefruit/orange marmalade on fresh-baked bread in the Italian countryside -- refreshing enough to drink quickly on a hot day, but hoppy enough to leave a lingering bitterness on your tongue long after the last sip.
Overall, a great IPA.  Were lucky to have such a primo brew so readily available.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","blazingspiral"

3885,"2008-05-27",3.9,"Pours a clear, bright golden with a big puffy white head that lingers for quite a while.  Lacing is really nice on this one.  The aroma is all about the hops with citrus hops, mainly grapefruit and lemon zest, and floral resiny hops dominating the nose.  There is a noticeable, if light, bready malt backbone as well.  The flavor is a more subdued version of the aroma with citrus and floral hops playing their part.  For me, the sweet, bready malt backbone is more evident in the taste.  Mouthfeel is fairly light but creamy.  The finish is extremely crisp and clean with only a slight bitterness in the aftertaste.  The light and crisp mouthfeel on this one make it extremely drinkable and would be an ideal spring and summer IPA.  I could see this being a staple in my fridge if I had access to it.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

S- Smell is floral piney hops with a sweet, bready malt backbone.

T- Its easy to say there is strong hops all the way through this one but it seems that it starts off with a strong malt base thats sweet with light fruit notes and an earthy fullness and moves into a bitter piney hop flavor. The hop bitterness lingers long after the brew has been swallowed.

M- Semi thick, a bit resiny, perfect amount of carbonation.

Stone finally makes it to Florida (I say that even though I havent lived here long :-) I bought this bomber the day it hit the shelves and drank it one day later so I doubt Ill ever try a fresher bottle unless I make the trip out west.

3885,"2008-04-08",3.9,"Slightly dark copper amber pour with an initially large but fading caramel colored head. Hoppy aroma, mainly floral and spruce and I dare say, raisins. TIngly, bitter mouthfeel. Not the hoppiest beer Ive had, but there is a really nice malt backbone in there, delivering a lot of balance as well as some dried fruit undercurrents.

first impression: A quickly dissipating head and a slightly unfiltered, hazy appearance gives a mixed bag of anticipation, but Ive had this beer before, and know what Im in for. The grapefruit is amazingly present in the aroma, and the color, while not the most interesting or poetic, is certainly not unappealing. The taste is remarkable. It warms, and travels down the chest with a trail of hops. It is a beer with a taste history to it. You can remember the flavor for minutes after, and it is a great flavor. Wonderfully bitter with heavy malt undercurrents. It is an exemplar of an IPA. 

Aroma/Olfactory:
Malt is roasted, toasty, and weighs heavily on the flavor. 
Hops are resinous, very flowery, and brimming with grapefruit and lemon.
Yeast/Bacteria reminds one of a stack of stone slabs, a hint of surface water but not odoriferous or negative in impression. 
It is tasty, heady, commanding, intoxicating, present, heavy, and delicious. 

Visuals/Appearance:
Color is pale, orange, single noted, and without real depth. 
Liquid is just a bit hazy and quiet. 
Head is gone, but the lace is remarkable present. Hangs more on the glass than the volume itself. Quite white at the start. 

Taste/Flavor:
Sweet in a slight way, but more bitter
Bitter is the overarching sentiment here, and it delivers in droves. Its not ruination, but its not far off, IMHO. 
Sour notes come with the bitter and citrus components. 
Beatifully balanced in hops and malt. 

Palate/Tactile:
Body/Mouthfeel is full and long lasting. 
Texture is slightly cloying, not in a sweet way, and not like a stout, but it does not dissipate quickly. 
Carbonation is crisp but not visually active. 
Finish is quite bitter, and nicely so. 

Second impression: Overall, this is a great beer, a fantastic example of an IPA, a strong exemplar of Stones lineup, and just a pleasure to have. One of my favorite beers, by far.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

Couldnt really smell a lot, maybe congested, but I dipped my nose in this accidentally trying to get a feel for it.  Body is a little thin and the abv throws me off.  I almost dont believe it.  Some citrusy things going.  again, light.  Compared to the Lagunitas IPA, its a totally different color, clarity and feel, almost confused about the style now.  All and all, nothing at all overpowering, light tasting, and not offensive in any way.  I like the hops but really not enough body to balance out.  Still not convinced that a beer this light is only one percentile away from OE in abv.  Memory:  Im at bevmo looking for a good deal.  A guy Id seen somewhere before walks up and hands me a 22.   Its the guy at the 15 items or less row... see him every time Im at safeway.  Hes like ""We just got the new Stone blah blah blah"".  He grabbed my hand and slapped this ugly looking bottle in my hand and walked away.  I just figured the guy was on crack, got fired from safeway, and just happened to be in kill mode.  I hid the 22 behind the closest thing I could find, bought my 9.99 sale 12pk of heineken and walked out.  I dont think that guys a drug addict anymore.

Update - Was able to try this draft at Najas Place in Redondo Beach, CA.

Golden amber almost no off white head.  Full piney dry hops, much better draught than the bottle.  Fresh crisp, lacking any sweetness but picking up some floral notes, this is all cascade and lingers nicely. 7 4 6 3","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"

The aromas are beautiful, I recommend using a brandy sniffer to capture the grapefruit, lemon, pine resin, and sage. The initial taste is a mix of the aromas and the mid-taste.

Very mild hop aroma; mostly sugar and lemon dishsoap (which I guess depends on your dishsoap); surprisingly light, as this is allegedly a fresh keg.  Excellent, oily hop character upfront; almost like a fresh-hop ale (odd considering the lax aroma); resiny, fruity and floral hop character with a mild maple syrup / candy sugar maltiness keeping things balanced; no astringency, intensely drinkable.

Werent hops supposed to be a preservative for beer?  Nuff said.  Im not sure why they became the desired flavor.  Some mild carbonation raises its head above the rudeness. Cannot quite get used to this bitter bite. Quite rude and offensive. Lingering unfriendly bitter medicinal taste that just keeps going and going.

The mix of grassy, flowery hops and malts makes for a very seductive smell. The flavor follows the aroma: a firm hop bitterness made from flowery, fruity, and spicy hops. There is a touch of citrus and grass, too. The hops are well-balanced by sweet malts that provide flavors of honey and sweet, very light crystal malts. The finish is dry with a sweet but hoppy aftertaste. I am quite curious what hop varieties were used - they are delectable and much more subtle than most high-alpha-acid US hop varieties. Overall, very pleasant.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Aroma is primarily grassy, herbal, and lemony hops.  The aroma is strong, but not as overpowering as many dry-hopped IPAs seem to be.  The flavor shows strong herbal hops up front, with a decent amount of buttery malts to back up the hoppy punch.  Definitelt some pine resin in there too.  Medium body.  Very crisp and sharp.  Id prefer a little more malt to balance things out, but this is a very good IPA nonetheless.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3885,"2007-07-23",3.9,"22 ounce bottle.  Damn, this is a great beer!

The pour delivered a glass of golden-yellow ale tinged with orange.  A thick, foamy white head developed and stayed around.  The lacing was very good.

The aroma was rather complex.  Primary aroma: fruity, citrusy.  Secondary aromas: caramel, cherries, hint of cloves, hint of caraway seed.

The taste just about knocked me out.  There is a very bitter ""kick"" when the ale first meets tongue.  The hoppy bitterness continues and finishes with another ""kick"" at the end.  Primary flavor: grapefruit/orange citrus, that is well balanced between the two.  Secondary flavors: caramel, slight lemon, slight floral.

I will definitely be having a few more bottles of this in the near future.","Washington, USA","troysworktable"

3885,"2007-06-10",4.1,"Appearance: Pours a light orange body with a medium white head.

Smell: Profusely fruity hop aroma, with brilliant notes of grapefruit and golden raisins.

Taste: Generous amounts of fresh hop flavors, none of which are overpowering. Grapefruit, pine needles, and juicy orange slices progress to a light caramel maltiness. It all leads to a short-lived, subtly bitter dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a fine, resiny texture. 

Drinkability: Unsurpassing drinkability! An excellent IPA charged with great hop flavors and enough malt to remain well-balanced.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
3885,"2007-06-09",4.0,"Poured a cloudy straw color, with a massive white head that is fading rather quickly.  The nose is bursting with fresh hops, theres no doubt about this.  The taste builds and fades with a massive hop character with a taste stuck in there that reminds me of green grass.  The bitterness hits you with a subdued yet noticeable shot of the finest american hops.","Chesterfield, Virginia, USA","luv2brew"

Carbonation is noticable.  Aroma is all citrus hops.  Flavor is caramel malt with some spice notes.  Undertones of grapefruit and pine are also present.  You feel a nice spicy hop bite on your tounge.  The beer is medium-bodied.  It ends with a very dry, bitter finish.  This is an above average IPA, but for me I would prefer a little bit bigger flavor to go along with the excellent hop kick.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Bursting with hops flavor, perfect blend of bitterness and maltiness, and finishes just as bitter and refreshing.  Has a very refined clean, crisp flavor/palate/finish to it, something youd expect out of a great lager, which makes this tremendous.  Great brew, and just as good as the Ruination IPA, in my opinion, but is just plain easy to drink, near-perfect blend and complexity, I really wouldnt change anything about it.

Aroma is divine with the smell of fresh hops - going so far as to remind me of the aroma of some cask ales.  Flavour is heavy hops on the piney side.  Bold and full hoppy aftertaste.  Rewarding.  RE-RATE:  Just had a fresh bottle.  Absolutely outstanding.  The fresh hops werent as piney as I previously found.  Further re-rate:  A bottle from a different batch seems to have lesser aroma and warmer piney bitterness.

Stone is new to New Jersey, so I am just discovering this - this one was a big surprise.
The ratio of hops in the flavor is perfect.  Too many brews try to get hoppy and get a little silly, not these guys.  Dont get me wrong, the hops are strong, but its perfect.

The cheese isnt a major thing, but just a minor flaw I noticed.  Overall its an invited aroma.  The first sip reveals a somewhat thin, bitter beer.  Im not loving the aftertaste.  Im prefer some more malt in a beer this big.  Im going to have to disagree with the majority here, I think this is a pretty week showing from a great brewery.

Spotty lacing. Aromas of hops, spice, flowers, citrus, rind and some sweetness. Fore is astringent, spicy, hops dominating. Back of the tongue brings a bit of the malt sweetness, but mostly the overpowering hop bitterness and bite. Medium mouthfeel, semi sticky, coating the roof of the mouth. Finish is medium length, spicy, bitter. The citrus and hops really dominate the finish, not as much malt balance as I would have liked.

Bit of an alcohol presence unfortunately, which surprises me since Stone Ruination is nearly a percent higher, and I just finished one of those and tasted no alcohol.

3885,"2007-03-28",4.2,"This beer pours a cloudy light tan color, with a pure white head that leaves behind very good lacing.  The aroma promises hops in abundance, and the flavor deliveres.  Crisp strong hop flavor, and a beer I can drink all night long.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
3885,"2007-03-28",3.5,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a commodious Guinness Stout glass.  Pours a dark honey to light amber color with a creamy, off-white head and a fair amount of lacing.  I suppose I must be deranged - that or an ignorant Philistine but, for aroma, my notes say ""smells like beer.""  The first sip yields a moderate to agressive hop bite which I would describe as floral and lingering, as the hop bitterness hangs around for a while.  Its a medium-bodied beer, well on the dry side and with lively carbonation.  A fairly drinkable and complex brew, given that the last third of the bomber - once it has warmed a few degrees - reveals some residual sweetness.

Pros
- is 100% Rheinheitsgebot compliant - nothing but malted barley, yeast, hops and water in this beer 
- nice buzz value.  With its 6.9% ABV, one bomber produces a mild head buzz
- the brewer makes no apologies for, and even trumpets, the hop bitterness on the label.  This is hoppy beer.  Damn right, and was meant to be.

Cons
- I have no choice but to rate Stone IPA ""move to the back of the line"" on both repurchasability and refreshability (how easily it slides down the gullet when youre hot and thirsty).

As this review reflects my own personal taste, please dont cop any negative takeaways.  I have zero doubt that this is a superlative beer, one that is meant to be savored and not ""slammed."" And - as is obvious from the other reviews - its an exemplar of the style.  I can only assume that IPAs are not my strong suite, not my preferred style.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","wheresbaldo"

Not bitter enough to be memorable and not malty enough to be smoothly appealing.

I normally am into malty style ales but the hops came through very pleasantly in this.  Thats a lot to say for a beer that takes credit in its amount of hops usage.  Anyway, it poured a nice gold/orange color with a small head.  The aroma was of citrus and pine.  The palate was very crisp and drinkable, and the taste was nice and mellow, citrusy, with just the right amount of hop bitterness.

3885,"2007-03-04",4.1,"22oz. Bomber

I cracked open the bottle and immediately got hit with a whiff of hops. I have a feeling Ill like this one.

Stones IPA poured a chill hazed tarnished golden with very lively carbonation rising from all over the bottom of my pint glass. Sitting up top is a nice 1+ finger creamy white eggshell head. 

Smell is of hops. All hops. Big piney, oily hops. There is a citrus freshness that pokes its head out in the middle. There is a little earthiness at the end. As this beer warms, the malt that holds it all together comes through as a nice backbone aroma.

Taste is what I think an IPA should taste like. The malt in the smell is a nice sturdy backbone. The hops take center stage though. Hop oils abound followed by pine needles. There is that citrus again on the middle of my tongue. This all leads into a moderate bitterness that leaves me wanting more.

Mouthfeel is close to perfect. Medium bodied. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Goes down awfully smooth.

It would be very easy to drink these all night long. The bitterness leaves you wanting another drink right after the last. The abv is hidden very well. Dangerously drinkable.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a light to medium, clear amber with a small, white head that mostly diminished and left virtually no lacing. The aroma was moderate molasses malt and heary grapefruit and orange hops. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, acidic and bitter. The finish flavor was moderately sweet and heavily bitter with a long duration. Both were dominated by citurs hops, but a little too much for my taste.

This beer always underwhelms at first -- its significantly lighter in color than most IPA/DIPAs I drink with a much weaker aroma and a lot less oomph in general.

Drinkable, sure - but given the amount of seriously great American IPAs around, I probably would be in no hurry to grab this one again.  Being Stone, the stakes were high, but I was slightly let down by this one - probably a result of a few things - super high expectations, the grandiose claims on the back of the bottle, and having this back to back with the Smuttynose IPA, which made this one seem a little......washed out.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"

Given that this is a good beer, I cant help but feel it is overrated. It pours a nice golden yellow with a bit of amber that is typical for the style. The head was white and fleeting. Aroma is a big hoppy blast, and quite sweet in the nose. Nothing terribly surprising or complicated happening, but definitely an inviting citrusy aroma. The flavour expands upon the scent, amplifying what youd expect and making it bigger in the mouth. Very sweetly hoppy and citrusy off the top, with some orange flavours playing, followed by a solidly crisp and bitter finish. It didnt take my socks off and slap me around with them, but this is still a solid IPA. Ive had better though, and I think this one might glide by on its ""bad boy"" reputation a bit more than it deserves.

3885,"2006-11-04",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Where exactly does the Stone India Pale Ale fit in?  I see Ruination, Anniversary IPAs, Vertical Epic and all manner of colored fonts and leisurely demons.  Its all a bit confusing, and somewhere in the mire of Stones ubiquitous beers I suddenly stumble across the small bottled India Pale Ale.  Where did it come from?  What does it taste like?  Employing my trained tongue I gave it a sampling, totally unaware of what to expect.  What I found was yet another ho-hum Pale Ale like so many others, characteristic of the style and well brewed but unexciting after having the same taste over and over again.  Even the sinister balrogs on Stones bottles have become mundane, resulting in an unjustified apathy and blasé attitude.  But label art is hardly germane to the actual beer.  Stones unadorned IPA is thick and peach-orange colored with a very thin white cap that reduces down to a doily like web of spacious but connected foam threads.  One need only approach the IPA to get an impression of the aroma: hops dominates with an orange and tangerine cofactor.  I was a bit surprised to find less grain/hops/oats/biscuits smell in here than in similar tasting beers.  Its a disturbingly smooth and flat beer reminiscent of milk, painting the tongue with a very dry yeastiness and manifesting a slight hop burn in the back of the throat.  Oddly this hoppiness grows for several seconds after the sip until its detrimental to the taste, and then passes.  As a staple IPA it tastes good enough to justify purchasing a pack for friends at a party, but its a bit too flat and a bit too dry even for my own liberal arts college tolerance to accept.  Yet another washout for the whole style and another lukewarm brew from Stone.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3885,"2006-10-30",4.1,"Sparkling golden with a brilliant white, creamy head, good size, longevity and lacing.  If you like hops you will love the nose, fresh pine and resin with subtle citrus.  Flavor is much the same, fresh pine and grassiness from the hops with still the subtle grapefruit citrus hops.  A SUBTLE toasty, caramel sweetness but nicely done so.  Bitterness is medium-high but never harsh and complements the hop flavors brilliantly.  Palate is medium in body with a soft to lively carbonation and a creamy yet refreshing feel.  Finish is long, refreshing, and bitter, but still sweet with grapefruit.  Truly a remarkable IPA, and this coming from a non-hophead.  Flavors meld so well together and remain so ultimately fresh.  Stone delivers once again.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Of course, plenty of hop bitterness.  The only thing lacking is the malt.  No ""malt backbone"" to provide a foundation for the hops to rest on.  This lets them really run wild, but makes the beer a bit too much to handle. Its almost like eating a whole lot of BBQ sauce on too few ribs.  Its tasty, but needs more.

The nose has all youd expect: grapefruit, citrus, pine, floral accents.  These transfer directly into the flavor dept.  There is a faint caramel malty sweetness which underlies a huge hop contingency.  Grapefruit, citrus, and candy orange slices are noted in the mid-palate, whereas the side- and back-palate are peppered perfectly with a mildly-lingering pine resin dry-hop.  All of the wonderful complexities of this brew come together almost flawlessly.  It has a very nice, refreshingly creamy (and cleansing) finish that works wonders for the overall effect!

Im an IPA fanatic and after a recent string of Belgium samplings, this was a nice homecoming.  Stone IPA has a big pine/hop taste that balances well with a sweet malt and citrusy fruit flavor.

Flavor is pretty hoppy, but not necessatily overly bitter, just a nice cleansing crispness.  The malt is pretty tamed down, but it is noticable.

*Overall* - This beer didnt quite live up to my expectations. It was very enjoyable for 80% of the experience, but the ending left me longing for more. This is a great beer, but I felt a little disappointed.","Ft. Collins, Colorado, USA","NephrenKa"

The body is peachy and drinkable, noting honey and toffee malts with an apple fruitiness.  The finish is overly bitter and almost acidic.

Now the grapefruits (zesty) blend right in there. Other aromas and flavors include pine, resinous, and floral accents. A touch of spiciness to this one too (yeast or hops?), as a peppery flavor comes out among the hop bitterness. Hop level was totally enjoyable and unoffensive in this one. The best tasting IPA Ive ever had to go along with a golden yellow (slight orange) pour with a nice head that stuck around til the last sip (which got better as it warmed).

Thanks to hezron for sharing this.  At $4.99, it seems like a great bargain.
Aroma / Apppearance - Extremely hoppy nose reminds me of freshly peeled oranges, lemons and a glen of pine trees.  The creamy dense head soon mellowed out, leaving behind a lemon colored body.
Flavor / Palate - The first impression is of grapefruit, lemon lime and pine needles.  The bitterness of the hops starts out on the back of the tongue, then slowly moves forward until the entire mouth is filled with the taste of west coast hops.  The body is extremely full, getting into every crevice and corner of the mouth.  An excellent example of an IPA and an excellent value at $4.99.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

West coast hops dominate as expected. Pour of an even deeply hued golden, with a thin rim of white head. Wow. Flavor is incredibly sweet and lucious. The hops almost play background to an incredibly intense florally fruity malt, that carries a gentle current of citrus reductions and pleasent curries of planty resins. Not the least bit harsh or vegetal. A full mouthfeel, with rich creamed malts and a hint of cream of wheat, with raisins, brown sugar and maple syrup.

This brew is bold, sharp, and forthcoming yet very well blanced. The hop profile is so fresh and inviting yet slaps me in the face as I walk through the door.

3885,"2006-05-13",3.8,"Strawberry! This has been my standby draught at Tonys on Newport in OB since they added the handle. But that aftertaste, that particular flavor has been eluding me until tonight, when I finally figured out what it was. STRAWBERRY! Maybe nobody else will agree, but after the lingering predictable IPA markers like piney, grassy, citrusy hop signatures, there is the one element that remains that truly elevates one IPA above the other, and that is the lasting impression: i.e., the aftertaste. Sometimes it is hop-based, sometimes it is a malt remnant that lingers. In the case of this one, there is a slight bit of malt that conflicts with the hovering hops. The end result, to me, is exactly like the aftertaste of eating fresh strawberries. Truly unique. And blah blah blah...pours and looks and has the same retention of every other IPA out there. Not that theres anything wrong with that.","San Diego, California, USA","bindpmc"

It poured a nice amber color with a frothy off-white head, a slightly cloudy body, and sparse lacing.  The aroma was floral, pine, and citrus  what you would expect in an IPA.

Aroma of freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice into one glass, backed by a faint nose of lemon, pine needles and caramel malt. Palate shows a fine and mild spritzy carbonation with a medium body which was perfect for the style. No mistaking the big hop additions in the flavors; lots of citrus and pine in tune with the delicious aromas. A touch of sweetness from the caramel malts are noted mid-palate, but the finish is a crisp and bitter hop contribution; nice and long.

There are also rich malt that balance things out nicely.  Fantastic lacing the whole way down.  One of the thickest, most full bodied IPAs Ive had.

Very grassy and piney in the nose with a small malt background.  Very hoppy, but it doesnt smell like a salad, its more subtle than that.

Its squishy juicy hoppy goodness at its best with just enough malt.  Grapefruit/lemony citrus with a touch of pine.  This is a touch on the watery side it seems at first, but letting it sit in the mouth and this gets a nice foamy slipperiness with a touch of alcohol heat.  The flavor was a slight letdown compared to the awesome aroma.  Citrus and pine hops, with a touch of very pale malt.  Not a lot of complexity and a little bit off balance.  Still, the hophead in me is happy, especially with the lovely lingering grapefruit seed bitterness that almost feels like alcohol burn.

Poured from the bottle into my humble shaker glass, this hoppy marvel had a clear, deeply golden body that developed an almost yellow head.  The aroma initially smelled of fresh (and I mean ""right- off- the- vine- fresh"") piney hops, and then mellowed with some time to a more grapefruit-like hoppy smell.  The flavor was quite hoppy as well, but without being punishingly bitter.  Im not much of a ""hop-head"" but I really enjoyed this beer.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","Quixote18"

3885,"2006-04-12",3.3,"This was my first IPA and this made quite an impression.  Strong aroma of hops.  I like the pour, a bright orangish, amber color with an off-white head that diminished to a decent lacing.  Someone described the taste as lemony, and I guess that about hits the main notes of this beers flavor.  I wasnt crazy about it at first, but as I got towards the end of my bottle, I quite enjoyed it.

Delicious dry hoppy taste, piney and herbal spice, a good rolling bitterness on the tongue, some tropical fruitiness, a balancing grainy, biscuity maltiness and a dry grainy finish with a lingering hoppiness in the palate.

[march 5,2009]

Bottle best before April 28, 2009. Its so rare to find fresh Stone in Knoxville, I was a little excited to snatch this one off the shelf at McScrooges. This beer has a pretty clear body, looks filtered, and a large white head forms and lasts. The aroma is delightful with assertive grapefruit, herbs, and pine. Its a clean and juicy aroma. Ah, this is a good IPA with plenty of resinous quality and a strong hop dose in every sip. This one has plenty of grapefruit and grassiness but strays away from being heavily dank. Its a clean and hoppy IPA which I certainly enjoy having access to.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

A little soft, but not fizzy. Very good.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","PhysZac"
3885,"2006-03-26",4.4,"Aroma is beautiful; extreme vegetative hops. There is a woody, spicy background in the flavor coming through big time in addition to the strong grapefruit and pine. Carbonation makes for a near perfect biting effect with the hop hit. Palate retains woody, floral flavors; not just straight up bitterness. This stuff is just about #1 for me.

The flavor is moderately-to-heavily bitter, moderately sweet with a long, moderately-to-heavily bitter, moderately astringent finish.

I didnt rate this when I lived in San Diego and got it fresh all the time.  I rememer it being hoppier which leads me to believe this one has been on the shelf for a few months at least.

3885,"2006-03-10",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2007 Stone has this habit of saying their beers are too powerful or hoppy for any one to really like them. But, more and more I find that to be their schtick rather than the truth. I always expect to be blown away by some sort of massive hop flavor, but more than anything else...they just seem to be well balanced.  Pours a deep transparent gold color with a frothy white head. The aroma is quite hoppy, very piney and grassy...some citrus as well. It seems in this case that the bark is worse than the bite. While there is a moderate hoppy flavor, its nowhere near overwhelming...thoug it does remain dominant accompained by some very light carmelized sugar. This beer is light and refreshing, with just enough maltiness over the tounge to let you know its there. The finish it a small bitter hop punch with a warming alcohol feel.

3885,"2006-02-26",4.2,"12oz bottle. Poured cloudy honey gold into a tulip with a medium, rapidly diminishing off-white head. Not much lacing and could stand to be less cloudy (though the cloudiness can probably be attributed to refrigeration--this bottle is ~40 degrees F). Nose is wonderfully crisp with citrus and floral notes, some sweetness. Perfect IPA aroma. Flavor is initially bitter with some butterscotch, quickly develops into hoppy pine and floral notes with a little citrus. Caramel malts become apparent shortly afterward. Really excellent balance (Im surprised given Stones penchant for overhopping). Finish is medium-short, bitter and sweet. Bitterness sticks around maybe just a touch longer than I would like.

Malt and hop balance is very good for an IPA, athough I would prefer more sweetness. Finish is clean, dry, bitter, and grassy from the the dry hopping.  Does not stick at the back of the mouth like some IPAs. Nicely done. REVISITED 8-10-06. Boy a fresh bottle makes a difference. The residual sweetness that I was looking for was there.

This time I had a whole bomber to myself, the perfect way to enjoy a Stone brew.  Stone IPA pours dark, hazy gold color with a two finger head that laces the glass nicely.  The citrus hop aroma is assertive and oh so good.  Obviously high quality hops lead the way in the flavor, backed up by some citrus and well balanced maltiness.  The light carbonation and medium body is just about right, and the finish stays with you for a long time.  Youll be glad it stays though.  This ale is an excellent example of the style.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"

The aroma sparked several childhood ""scent memories"" (okay I was half-canned - bear with me): McCowans Highland toffees and a long-defunct (I suspect) hardboiled candy called Spangles. Weird. I guess that means the aroma had some toffee-like malt and plenty of sugar. My main criticism of this was that it didnt seem to have enough body to carry those huge flavours. I would have liked a bit more muscle. Flavourwise, there is a brief flash of toffee before a tidal wave of resinous piney hops. Damn, this is bitter. You could strip paint with this.

Fine bubbles that stick to the glass, a very inviiting look indeed. Beautiful aroma of light citrus and floral hops that suggests the treasure that awaits. Smooth and lightly carbonated, not at all harsh like some IPAs out there. The flavor is that of citrus over a nice caramel malt backbone. This beer is just beautifully balanced. The dry finish is not overly bitter or offending, the downfall of many IPas. Just a marvelously crafted beer. With regard to my impressions of the GD IPA and the Victory Hop Devil next to the Stone offering, I wrote down my impressions and ratings, and then went back to see how I had rated them before, and there was little difference.

3885,"2005-12-23",3.8,"Bottle (RB Sydney XMASG 05): Cloudy orange amber. Light coloured, chewy toffee aromas with some darker, slightly burnt malt notes underneath lots of structural, tokay-like hops. This one certainly has a strong presence; stone fruits (haha) and smokey caramel malts are almost instantly replaced by slightly burnt caramel, then a fist full of vibrantly spicy, pine/orange hop flavours that dominate the back palate. I really enjoyed this, though probably because of the hype I was expecting more. My main criticism is that, especially in the flavour spectrum, it seems to be a combination of powerful ingredients rather than a cohesive, integrated whole. This results in some gaps appearing in between the ingredients. Still, this is a really nice beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Aarleks"

The flavor was citrusy with some sweetness to it, with a crisp bitter finish and a long lasting hoppy aftertaste.  If you love hops, this is a beer for you.  The complexity of this beer is what is striking about it.  The palate was fairly average, but Im a cream ale kind of girl, Im used to ultra smooth.  The alcohol content is slightly evident in the aftertaste, and definetly evident when you are almost done with the beer and you get up to grab some chips.  This beer packs a punch.  Fantastic overall.","Fullerton, California, USA","hannaugh"

The hops are definetly up front but there are hints of malt now and then, especially after it warms up a bit. Mouthfeel seems off to me, not very rich or full but pleasant.

A wonderful bright citrus hop aroma. So big it almost seems like candy. The maltiness is there too--sweet and honey-like, but blending in seemlessly into the hops. Smells creamy, almost like lemon orange sorbet. A bit of pine. Big lip curling hops. Hoppy as all get out. But it doesnt leave you with just hop bite. As I exhale the bitterness is relieved with a bready warm maltiness that keeps the hop abuse from being too much. Surprisingly light on the palate, clean finish.

3885,"2005-08-02",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2006 Pours a light golden with an ample head and active carbonation. The nose dominanted by citrus, pine, and a whiff of humus, and the first sip - ahhh! This is a macho IPA, with a powerful blast of hop flavor and a full, rich mouthfeel, but that doesnt mean it lacks refinement. Quite the contrary - this beer brings forward plenty of sweet citrus and floral tones, it balances the aggressive hops with a warm roasted malt, with flavors that pass from grapefruit to malt to nuts, hiding the alcohol nicely, before drifting into that long and lovely bitter hop finish. This is a great beer, worth revisiting time and again.


Upon numerous additional encounters with this beer, my rating has fallen somewhat. Sure, its a great ""first-sip"" IPA, but its not my top choice for a well-balancing drinking IPA.

This is an odd aroma beer-- from the bottle you get a concentrated hop-forward, full body IPA blast, but in the glass a lot of that fades away, leaving subtle citrus (grapefruit) and grassy/pine notes; not the hop assault on the nose I was expecting. Very well balanced hop and malt taste-- initial spice and bitterness is immediately smoothed out by slight sweetness. Medium body.

Rerate: Not nearly as bitter as when I foolishly at ate with very sweet food, though Im gonna keep the rating the same.

Hops show good complexity with metallic hardness, aniseed and a grainy farmyard character early. The best showing I have seen and clearly this bottle was in better nick than a Purvis-sourced sample from 2008.
April 2008 (3.2)
Funny beer. Nose shows some faint hope sweetness and a funky, dirty fruit note. Not really hoppy at all in terms of aromas, at least in the traditional sense. Mild palate weight with elegant fruity notes before a harder metallic-like character kicks in.
May 2005 (3.1)As can be expected from the marque a full flavoured in your face interpretation. Mild herbal nose with some fruity ale traits. Very similar early in the palate before giving way to some full throttled hop action. Long, strong finish, but just a touch too abrasive at the end.

Scattered lacing was left around the glass as this was consumed. Strong floral aromas rose from the glass that was backed by and equally string citric piney smell. Completely hop dominated nose but not to the point of being over done, there was a doughy malt presence keeping it in check. Citric bitterness hit the tongue first with a slightly sweet malt coming though shortly after. The after taste was mildly bitter with an earthy hop bite.

A mostly clear, deep amber body under a mostly lasting, rocky, off-white head that laces in morse code (a dash here... a dot there...). Heavy pine and citrus aromas, with soapy touches of Irish Spring® and black pepper. Flavor starts with a smooth malt, then its all delicious, grapefruity hops. Despite some dryness, I find a long, tinlgy hop finish and a clingy mouthfeel. Extra points for the 2-color screened bottled. Id like to try this alongside a Bells Two Hearted and a Dogfish 60 (but, hey... who wouldnt?)
P.S.  I looked up ""hops"" in the dictionary (as per the advice of the Commercial Description) and did not find a picture of Stone IPA. I did not find a picture of anything, for that matter. I feel used...

Very well-balanced flavor with a mellow hop bitterness and a good amount of hop flavor that melded very well with the malt backbone. Rich mouthfeel that felt almost creamy from the fine carbonation.

3885,"2005-03-18",3.9,"(12 oz bottle; 22-Nov-04) An excellent IPA with a sweet, bready maltiness and a balancing, moderately strong, fresh hops flavor.  But I wouldnt say this IPA is dominated by hopped by any means, and thats fine with me because I typically prefer a more balanced IPA.  Once the sweet breadiness wears off a bit, the hops bitterness is moderately strong and extends the finish considerably, but again, its not as bitter as the description would lead you to believe -- Ive had many IPAs that were much more bitter.  It has a malty and very bready nose, but also some mild hoppiness.  In fact, if youve ever been to the Stone brewery and reveled in the glorious aroma, this IPA smells just like that!  Medium bodied, but the mouthfeel is quite full and substantial.  Medium golden color, somewhat cloudy.  Whitish head has good size on the pour, but settles to a thin sheen, leaving modest lacing.  Very well done indeed!<hr>Rerate (12 oz bottle: Hi-Time Wine Cellars; 01-Feb-05 and again on 17-Mar-05) Im doing a separate review for this bottle since its apparent to me that my previous rating was for a bottle that probably sat around for a bit.  I just purchased this bottle by mistake, but I wish all mistakes were this fortuitous because this must be a very fresh bottle, and it has inspired me to do a second complete rating.  Whereas the bready maltiness showed quite a bit of presence in the previous bottle, here, we have an all out hops assault on the taste buds and nostrils.  In fact, Im not getting any breadiness anywhere.  The nose is very hoppy with a moderate, sweet citrus aroma in the background.  The flavor is very hoppy, very bitter, moderately citrusy with a mildly sweet and fruity base for balance.  This beer is dark golden in color and completely clear, not one iota of haziness, unlike the bottle in my previous rating.  The off-white head pours to almost a full inch in height and maintains a thin layer for the entire session, leaving numerous streamers of lace drooping all over the glass.  For a standard IPA, this is superb.  And proof that freshness matters with IPAs.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Bottle.  Pours clear orange color with a thin white head.  Mostly piney hop aroma with some citrus.  Very pungent, piney hop taste, a little grapefruit as well.  Very bitter.

I was almost afraid this would be too hoppy and bitter. But it was very smooth and good. Balanced enough for an IPA this thing explodes with hops and leaves a crisp bitterness on your tounge.

This is how IPAs were meant to be it is a real treat to drink this beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrunkenWeasel"

Mild aroma...the taste, WOW, this is  damn good stuff. from the bottle description, I was worried this might be too hoppy for me, but luckily theyre in perfect balance.

3885,"2005-02-17",4.4,"If there is a better IPA out there, I hope to find it some day but until then, I will remain convinced that this is the Holy Grail of IPAs......   Glowing apricot/amber under a nice off white head and lots of lacing.  Hoppy and sweet aroma of citrus fruits (grapefruit) and a little peppery spice.  Flat-out great hoppy flavor but with planty of well balanced sweetness including a hint of peaches and bubble gum.  Many IPAs, even good ones, often cross the precarious line of bitterness but this one dances it like the old Michael Jackson (note the subtle beer writer double entendre).  Mouth feel was soft and full.  Finish was clean, bitter, slighly oily and in a word: perfect.

3885,"2005-02-08",4.4,"A well crafted beer.  From the Head, Color and Aroma to the great taste.  Great balance. I sometimes find the hops overwhelming the body in many IPAs.   One quibble is that I prefer East Kent goulding Hops.  Currently, though,  this is my favoite IPA.  Pizza Ports Franks Double IPA is competition.  Oh, one other thing, this is DRY, although you wont know it till you get up off the Bar Stool.","USA","flredsox"
3885,"2005-02-06",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2005 Stones most enticing hop aroma delivers its promise to the very last dry-hopped drop!  This is the best IPA Ive tasted, with an equally beautiful pale malt finish brewed nearly to dryness.   Having finally tasted the draft version at Dominions Beer Fest only increases my admiration.  Stone has clearly mastered the art of hop extraction!","Herndon, Virginia, USA","mctous"

3885,"2005-02-06",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2005 Another exceptional offering from Stone.  Pours a deep orange with hints of gold. Lite  minimal white head.  The aroma is wonderful.  Bright hoppy citrus and sticky pine.  Very fresh smelling (like Im holding a handful of hops fresh off the vine) with some lite malt holing it all together.  The flavor is very nice.  It starts with a creamy, litely sweet malt (caramel?) mixed with citrus (orange) hops.  Moves to grapefruit flavors mixed with wood and pine bitterness.  The finish is long, bitter, and dry.  You get a hint of alcohol warmth, which is nice.  The body is fine.  This brew leans to hop heavy but the malts are study enough to keep it all together.  Very tasty!

Rated this again out of a firkin (sp?) taped at falling rock during GABF.  Had been dry hopped for some time.  The aroma was more pronounced this time with excellect citus hops.  Very floral.  the flavor was just as excellent though I noted it was significnatly more sticky in body.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Aroma of sweet citrus, almost a ruby red grapfruit/orange salad with honey on top.  The smell is realy sweet, almost like peach jam.  The flavor is sweet fruit (orange, peach) that shows some hops character, but not overly so. This is a really well balanced beer!  The finish is semi-dry -> dry, with a ton of citrus fruit.  The mouthfeel is pretty nice, but not spectacular. I was expecting a hop monster and was pleasantly suprised.  I wish I could have this as an everyday beer.

3885,"2005-01-23",4.0,"This was the beer that alerted me to the brewing genius that was Stone. Its a fantastic example of everything that an IPA should be, loaded with hops, bitterness and just an amazing flavour that is among the best of IPAs. I actually preferred this to the Ruination, which I thought was perhaps a bit much ambition for it to carry. Excellent.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","MillStreetMan"
3885,"2005-01-23",4.3,"Translucent strawberry blonde, with a white cloud of of head that quickly gave way to clingly ring of lace, but with only a swirl the head came right back to life, giving away that incredible hoppy aroma.  Pine trees, citrus, grassy, this thing has the whole nine yards.  The first sip goes down dry and lip-smackingly bitter, but somehow the malt fights its way through and holds on to the back of your palate after the first coat of hops saturates your tastebuds into submission.  Maybe my sample was getting a little old (6-8 months Id say), but I kinda tasted a little vanilla in the aftertaste, something I didnt notice when I had the first 2-3 from my 6 pack.  Alcohol also makes its presence known after about the half pint mark.  For some people balance in a Beer is important, and I sort of fall into that catergory, but sometimes in life you find balance in inequality, order in chaos, yada-yada-yada.  This Beer is the gold standard of American IPAs, and my personal favorite from Stone.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
3885,"2005-01-22",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2005 I thought that all of Stones brews were supposed to be real bad-ass beers, but this is one well-balanced, tasty, refreshing IPA.  Pouring a clear amber color with a sudsy white head, this has strong (but not overwhelming) piney and floral hop aromas.  Theres some decent malts at the base, but the hops do take over with pine, grapefruit, and earthy herbal hop tastes.  Theres also a bit of an almost peppery spiciness to the drink.  Its got a refreshingly bitter finish that leaves me thirsty for another.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

Slightly cloudy light orange color. A medium sized white head. Aroma immediately hit me with bready goodness. A hint of oranges and some pepper. The taste is up front and very hoppy. A nice balance of fresh hops and some spicy clove in the finish. It has grapefruit and some nice light malts to counteract that taste. The finish is smooth and carbonated. This also has a hint of tangerine or some other more delicate citrus fruit than just grapefruit. Very nice.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

While some found it very hoppy, even to the point of being unbalanced, others were suprised that it wasnt as dry as they expected and found it very balanced.  I fall into the latter.  I lean towards the APAs vs. the IPAs for the very reason of balance.  While the true Hophead disciple will love say Victory HopDevil, I gravitate towards the Sierra Nevada APA.  All of that to say that this Stone brew falls more into the balanced category.  Which ultimately worked out for me since I bought this since it is available in Ohio and Stone APA isnt.

3885,"2005-01-03",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2008 Id been led to believe that this is the benchmark IPA, and its easy to see why. The hop attack is huge. It has all that resin, oiliness, pine, grapefruit,  flowery character and all the rest you expect. Its big, bold and brassy. As upfront as they come. But, despite all that, I didnt find it too aggressive. In fact, I found it a quite smooth drop. OK, its quite straightforward and maybe a touch one-dimensional, but I found it very appealing.

Very clean tasting, almost medicinal with all of those hop oils coming through very strongly. good, but not my favorite for this style.   not quite sweet enough to balance, and not quite enough character to make it one of my favorite IPAs.  I think this beer would benefit greatly with about 5-10% more crystal malt (or other similar unfermentable 40L range) added to the grist, but thats just my personal perferance.  very delicious.  very drinkable.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"

The hoppy nose is a near-perfect compliment to the lemony-grapefruity aromas that waft from a freshly-poured 22. I am a believer in drinking all good beer from a large-mouthed Belgian beer glass, and to truly appreciate this beer, you need to first inhale its essence.

It has received such great reviews. My next bottle was consumed on 5/23/06.  This was excellent.  Very balanced and highly citrus flavored beer.  The beer poured to overflowing the glass with the head.  The grapefruit aroma and taste were present throughtout.  This was one of the better IPA this year.  I am rerating based on this bottle. I enjoyed an excellent draught from The Capital Ale House on 2/10/07.  It was a well balanced IPA that I wish had purchased a larger glass.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Foxbush"
3885,"2004-10-27",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2005 This is the first in a series of beers that I SWEAR I thought I rated already but I guess I didnt.  I had this on tap on Ginger Mans in NYC.  This beer was hoppy and delicious... great aroma... all the right moves.  But it didnt quite satisfy when I got it home, in the form of a pretty thin and empty finish.  Dying to try the Ruination.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","biznizness"

Im an east coast guy and on a trip to LA I finally tastaed one - now I know what the hype is about. Great smell - I could live off of this one.

Easily one of my favorite IPAs.  Loved its purity claims and entertaining definitions on the bottle.  Love the Californian Gargoyle on the bottle.  (I was in a NYC deli and saw this as a single bottle in another random six-pack.  I brought this and three other high-end beers to the counter.  The new clerk asked is boss.. how much for this such and such cider?   ""Ah um,"" says the busy manager, ""$1.75"".  The clerk rings up each bottle as $1.75.

3885,"2004-10-17",4.2,"Bottle. Hoppy, floral aroma, very pleasant. Golden color, white head. Lots of hops, nice and bitter, and plenty satisfying, but just enough malt flavor to offset the hops, making it very drinkable. More hops in the aftertaste, and I want an IPA to remind me what it tasted like well after the fact. I think the extra hops and alcohol in the Ruination makes this beers big brother the better of the two, but this beer is every bit as good.

Yeah this is definitely an excellent IPA, the initial flavoring is strong and distinct.  The after-taste is unusually subtle yet powerful.  It really does an excellent job of masking the underlying power and presents itself as a hoppy giant.  Completely enjoyable and a superb brew.","USA","Loddeer"

As the head slowly dissipates it leaves and abundance of thick, intricate lacing. This beer looks good! Aroma is strong and hoppy. This isnt a sensitive beer; its a full frontal assault on the senses. Aroma is loaded with big bursts of hops, grapefruit, pine, and sharp notes of alcohol. Flavor starts off sweet with malt, cherry, and berry flavors. Soon pine nut, tobacco, grapefruit, and sharp hops flavors take over. The beer finishes with a mouth filling burst of bitter hops followed by an alcohol KO. Overall, this is one of the finest beers that Ive ever had the pleasure of tasting.

Nose: somethin else! A panoply of fruit, a citric cornucopia! Peaches and apricot, grapefruit, pineapple, melon, berries, and more, all in one little aroma!
Alert and lively, zesty, generous, and gorgeous!
Taste: superb! Fantastic flavor, yet none too bitter. A huge blast of hops jumps on the tongue, but not so severely. A firm body, also, excellent balance and malt backbone. 
More of a piney feel comes through as we drink, but its a minor note among so many others. Finish is medium, but tasty and satisfactory.

The taste is hop juice up front, leading to some citrusey, bready malt.  It ends with a big, bitter hop finish and aftertaste.  Its medium bodied and fairly well balanced - though it obviously favors the hops over the malts.  The slight malt and citrus help balance it well.

If you want to introduce someone to IPAs, this is the choice.  Does not have as strong of a citrus aroma and bitterness as most IPAs.  Also, the bitterness does not kick you in the back of the throat like some IPAs (not that that that is a bad thing, but its tough for a person new to IPAs to get used to).

It is very yeasty towards the bottom, so be careful when pouring if you dont want it. Aroma is full of mostly hops and some yeast. Hops aroma is a citrus (grapefruit, orange, and lemon) plus some sort of piney resin thing. Yeast hints are a barnyard/silage type of thing. Taste is very smooth and bitter. Full of lemon, grapefruit, and orange which acts as a sweetener to me. Mouthfeel is slightly lacking, its a little watery and slightly oily. But the flavor is definitely there.
Side note: 12oz bottle doest seem quite as good (10/7/2004). Another update (1/24/2006), 12oz seems pretty good, but do notice it isnt bottle conditioned like the bomber.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"

Wonderful fresh hop flavor balanced by the ideal amount of sweet, light malts.  Perfectly bitter too.  Malts kind of creep around the sides, evident but recognizing their place in this beer.  Body and mouthfeel are just flawless... wow.  I love this IPA.  Its not my favorite... but it is damn near perfect.  Ive been lucky enough to have had it bottled and on tap quite a bit in the last week- on tap the hops are a bit fresher tasting and more evident, but its definately very similar. :) (edited on 6/10 because apparently I had a cascade pellet stuck in my nose.)","Huntington Beach, California, USA","jonwell"
3885,"2004-04-13",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2004 Beer pours with a lovely golden, tan rue that is broken up by a frothy bubbly luscious head. Its nose is incredibly satisfying. Earthy, flowery and fruitilly bitter. Very smooth mouthfeel - almost silky. Perhaps the most truly delightful aspect of this brew is how its hoppy tartness is juxtaposed against its acidic palate. All in all look for this brew to smell wonderful, taste roundly bitter, fade into acidity and make love to your mouth.","ST. Louis, Missouri, USA","grat"
3885,"2004-04-12",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2006 Frothy white head over a clear golden/amber body.  Caramelly-sweet aroma that centers heavily no silage (musky acidity).  The flavor has a leafy sweetness with a sour, bitter hop taste.  Smooth mouthfeel.  This beer is well-made but its kind of one-dimensional in terms of hopping.  To me, it has too strong of an acidic tartness.

1/24/06 - 12oz bottle thanks to Blake.  Orange blossom honey and zippy orange peel in the aroma.  Fantastic aroma!  The flavor still has the silagey grapefruity tartness but its very enjoyable.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"

Nice golden/orange hue, massive creamy head that left more lace on my glass than ANY beer I've ever had!  Amazing structure!

Nose is fresh, cascade hops forward and lots of them, I don't get much maltiness here.  Essence of grass, lime, pine resin, peach.

Mouthfeel is smooth and full, some maltiness, but the hops are acidic and over-the-top, drowning out the maltiness in a sea op hops.  I guess it's medium sweet, but the hops and their acidic tartness throw the balance to the dry side, leaving a bit of tongue-bite as though I'd been smoking a pipe to long.  Fresh hops flavor, clean sharp finish.
Very drinkable for an IPA, and I wouldn't call myself a hophead really.  Nice.","Billings, Montana, USA","wulfhere"

Good hop bitterness but it has a balance of some malt sweetness in the finish. As the flavor fades the finish gets dry and bitter. This is a good overall IPA there wasn't the crystal malt flavor that I have seen in other IPA's. I still like the DFH 60 min more but this is also a good IPA that I would drink again.","Mt.

3885,"2004-04-02",4.6,"Pale golden body with a massive beige head that refused to die due to nice natural carbonation.  Aroma is floral, grassy, piney hops with an infusion of yeasty bready malt.  The taste is a wonderland of hops with spicy-hot pine resin like quality to the beginning of each sip.  Following that first assault by the hops, there are additional waves of grapefruit rinds, black pepper, marigold, and orange blossom.  The malt adds a butterscotch like sweetness to the mix, and the yeast adds a grittyness to the mouthfeel.  This is one of the absolute great IPAs anywhere.  I thank 123456green for the bomber, and look forward to the day when I can get this at my local store.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Copper/bronze and clear with vivacoius bubbles and average head with a gorgeous hop aroma.  As an IPA lover and hophead I appreciate the somewhat overtly hopped nature of the beer.  It is certainly a little out of balance in favor of the hops though.  The malt is just there like a backdrop, a canvas for Lee Chase's bitter palate of warrior, centennial, and whatever else he has hiding in there.

There is a sort of sweet-tart flavor there that teases you to tip it back and finish it. Looks fairly standard with a medium white head and an orange/yellow color. Aroma is outstanding with truckloads of citris and flowery hop, almost pollen like. Flavor is undescribable with citris and flowers, sweet malt just tickling your senses.

3885,"2004-03-26",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2004 I agree with all those seduced by the smell of this beer: like a summerdress in a field of cornflowers! The appearence is less inspiring, a kind of taco-shell yellow with a sudsy head. The texture is so pleasingly velvet and the flavor kind of reminds me of waffles and oranges. I expect the hops to be overwhelming, given the reputation of Stone, but they are not: generous and fresh and fruity but not overwhelming. Gentlemen, nits can be picked here, but lets face it, this is one of Southern California's most important beers, a very complicated refreshing and exciting beer that surprises with every sip.","USA","calivania"

Smells, well like an IPA should, clean and crisp of citric hops.

Taste is strong of citric hops with a lightly sweet malt background continuing throughout.

Mouthfeel I found disturbingly thin, not because it is really thin but because it was thnner than a well built pale ale, and I expect an IPA to have a heavier mouthfeel than an APA.

Overall this is a good, well-built beer, just not as good as expectation and hype. I'd drink again, most definitely, but I won't hold this up as the best IPA I've ever had, it's not.","Champaign, Illinois, USA","jables"

Aroma is sweet then bitter. You could almost say that the beer is obnoxiously hoppy. It does have a certain velvet quality to its palate but I dont think this extreme hopping does the beer any favours. It's an IPA for the sensory disabled.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"

Tastes very smooth for being so hoppy. You can definatly taste the alcohol. I'm thinking Chinook hops but there's a bit of grapefruit aftertaste which makes me think maybe some Cascade, but I think Stone doesn't use Cascade. The hops are complex so it's not like they just dumped in one type and forgot about it. The bottle states that they dry hop as well. The care here shows.

There is a balancing malt sweetness here that is required to carry this hop bomb.  The hop character has strong notes of bergemot as well as some resiny overtones; this is just pure hop nectar.

A good sniffing which appeals me by its originality. Taste surprises right away being very citric. I simply don't understand how so many people can love it that much since it's so distracting? Neverthless, there's a touch of honey malt and it's very clean. Talking about balance is totally out of place though and it didn't seem particularly pleasant. The body is honest, a solid medium body, but not as mouth-filling as other Stones I've had. Basically, this was totally blown away by the Lost Coast Indica we've had just before.

Simple, powerful, and clean aroma.  Moderately sweet, moderately bitter flavor becomes a lightly sweet, heavily bitter finish.  Very clean.  Medium-heavy body, creamy texture, lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: yeah, it's one dimensional, but it does it so well.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
3885,"2004-01-04",4.0,"11/29/03.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, bought at Liquorama in Upland, CA 11/5/03.  Pours to a clear, bold golden body-- looks rather full.  Rocky, off-white head that hangs around thinly with very good, sandy and shimmering lacing.  Carbonation runs through the body pretty vigorously.  Fresh, bright hop aroma with some delicate malts and hints of cloying sweetness.  Taste is a little bit of hay, no-nonsense bitter hops and pale malt.  Stings with carbonation and burn of hops.  Quite complex assortment of flavors going on with the tease of overwhelming bitterness but the balance of a subtly sweet outline. Very substantial mouthfeel, medium-full.  Finsh lingers long and turns to a somewhat harsh but pleasant bitter malt glow-- like fresh barley malts bursting in your mouth.  Mellowed but still punishing.   A deceptively simple brew, this just does what it does extremely well.  And I'm sure it's fantastic with spicy Indian or Mexican food.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Well the aroma of the hops is also great..its a treat to the nasal passages, quite flowery but yet not sweet smelling.
well what can is ay about the taste but hops, hops,hops yet it alo has a creamy sweetness..that isnt completelly over whelmed by the hops ( this must be a Stone thing, I tasted the same in the 03-03-03 Vertical)..very nice.

I have had Stone IPA exactly one other time, at a beer tasting party I hosted in February 2000. That was before my Ratebeer days, so all I had was my fond memory of it. Apparently it made an impression on the rest of the attendees at that party as it was the highest rated overall brew among the following other 11 beers: Steinlager, Carta Blanca, Beamish Stout, Zwiec, Young's Oatmeal Stout, Pilsner Urquell, Edelweiss Weissbier, Krombacher Pils, Mendocino Blue Heron Pale Ale, Sierra Nevada Big Foot and Rogue Dead Guy Ale. That's a pretty head group of beers! It's as good as I remember; it's only too bad that I can't get it in my local market!! Sweet hoppy apricot nose with a bit of a sour pungent aroma.

3885,"2003-10-14",3.7,"Color is a lighter shade of pale yellow, some hazy cloudyness with a finger high white head of looser thickness, fades and bubbles down to some bubbles along the rim. Lace in webby loose sheets. Smell is quite floral and sweetly hopped lending light pine, light grapefruit and a touch spicy. Not all that strong but very fresh and hoppy. Swirling brings out some soft caramel malts and alcoholic warmth. Taste is a calming smooth, subtle hoppy little treat. Solid floral and dried sense of hops with a good touch of pine and grapefruit mixing with peach notes. Nice light backing of soft caramel malts; a bit of toasted bread. Well balanced and the bitterness is well under check with nice lingering spicy dried grapefruit notions in the finish. Lightly creamy and a fair medium body feel with a crisp, clean subtle hoppy finish. Maybe expecting to much from this beer with all the high recommendations. Its a solid IPA for sure, but didn't quite make the impact on me with more of a mellower hop flavor then I was anticipating. Comparisons aside, this was very close to Town Hall's Columbus Pale.

Aug, 2003 Bottle - gift from Nuffield. Lychees aroma. Soft citric. Bursting citric hop flavours which become stronger with each sip until there is a long bitter burn. Sweet malt. Darjeeling tea. Each sip is different. A beer that develops and changes. Damn interesting. [3.8] 
Mar4ch, 2017 Gosh, it seems a lifetime ago that I first had this - or at least, a different life. I think this was one of the top beers on RateBeer, and it was a bold forerunner for beers that are pretty commonplace now. In the years since I have met and drunk with Greg Koch, the man who founded and ran Stone Brewing, and I have gradually ceased contact with pretty much all the folks I used to drink with. RateBeer is a different place now, and the folks that were central to its growth and success, and shaped its early destiny, have mostly drifted away. If we are in touch, its mostly through Facebook, and the rare, occasional meet up. The beer? Well, I think that what I said back in 2003 still pretty much holds true. I never really acquired a taste for these hop drinks. The malt character is not there - its a pale biscuit malt. Very bland and characterless. The beer is filtered and force carbonated, popped into a can, and meaningless. Theres no magic here, and I get no sense of ale - its a pale lager base, and then lots of hops put on top. I can drink this, as somehow Stone manage to cram in that many hops, and still make it palatable. The sweetness of the malt helps, I suppose. This is like drinking a strong Euro lager with strong hop flavours added. Take away the hops and, for me what you are left with is something undistinguished, but quite drinkable. To be honest, I prefer drinking strong Euro lagers, though I like one of these hop bastards now and again. I like this one for its status, its history, and for what it means to me personally.

The taste in the mouth is almost identical, with the malt balancing out the hops beautifully.  Just a really great beer.  10, 5, 9, 4, 19. RERATE:  7/4/08 - This is sort of a painful rerate for me.  Stone has long been a favorite, and God knows I don’t want to become one of those people who find it fashionable to beat on the brewer for no good reason.  But I’m simply not enjoying this beer like I once did, and a re-rate is in order, knocking it well out of my top 10.  Appearance has remained the same.  Aroma has altered - spicy, earthy, very little grapefruit, that note has unfortunately been replaced by a slightly vegetal note.  Some pine and spruce remains.  Good, but nowhere close to where it used to be.  Flavor matches the nose, with the addition of well balanced gummy malts.  But there is that clear, slightly vegetal note that persists that just doesn’t float my boat.  I know that hops vary from year to year, and perhaps this beer will come back to what I used to adore.  But for now, it is time to take things down a notch or two.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

A wonderful experience, for the most part. Thick white head left chunky bubbles in the glass. Aromas of fresh hops, sweet malts, and some caramel also. Bready, yeasty aromas as well. Tastes great. Finishes clean, with a tangy hop afterbite to it. Try some for yourself.","","Cobra"

After about 15 minutes, I was back to the ale and WOAH - I was gribbing the side of the pint with pure astonishment - there was a frothy, creamy head of pure hops growing tendrils of rich flavor to my tongue.  I may have always drank this too soon and too cold!  This ale is perfectly balanced - creamy head, crisp hops, a little bitterness, a bit of flowery dandelion.

ReRate-tap-tucson beer fest
ok, here is what everybody is talking about.  my bottle must have been old because what i got on tap at the fest was one hell of an ipa.  this may be the best one dimensional brew out there.  the aroma is just this side of paradise!  thanks to the guy at the Stone booth for the sticker :)
This beer is pretty much all hops.  This, along with Bells Two hearted are the most citrus-y brews out there (at least bottled and widely distributed).  This is one i dont drink that often even though it has to be the best widely available brew in my neck of the woods (desert).  

Re-Rate 2011 Either my tastes are changing or this beer has taken a turn for the worse.  Really catty which was common for ipas from this generation but now i can taste it much easier.  I dropped the rating down 2/10 of a point.  Two hearted is way better!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

Original 4.5 Deep dark golden color upon pouring. Head was smaller than expected - but leaves a bit of lacing. The aroma improves as it warms - starts off with a blast of sprucey hops but settles into a warm fruit like nectar. The beer is constantly active in my glass with massive amounts of bubble action. The flavor is initially hoppy and sprucey with a nectar sweet undertone aftertaste. Probably the best IPA I have had to date - does not assault you with hops and leave you hanging without a few malty notes to even it out.

Then it starts to become more complex with other fruit odors, maybe a little bit of a peach schnapps smell or, maybe its that I detect a little bit of the sweet smell of honey. Wow, my rookie nose is really showing its character, or is it that the complexity of this beer is blowing my mind? Upon the first taste I notice the malty sweetness and flavor explosion. Nice and bitter with plenty of mouth watering hoppy citrus flavor. Extremely refreshing and inspiring. The head retains itself at about a quarter inch leaving a nice lace to the end. Or no, its not over yet, I still havent finished the bottle. The rest pours smoother as it has warmed a little. This beer must be bottled conditioned because it is now cloudy in my glass, as the complex flavors improve. I know that this is the best IPA Ive had yet.","Arizona, USA","hoped"

Very nice, and well balanced, and it has an almost pilsner-like quality to it!  Flavor is also quite hoppy, but this has to be the smoothest hoppy beer Ive ever had.  The hops just seem to roll from the front of the tongue to the back, leaving with a medium bitterness aftertaste, which again fades into notes of grapefruit.  Truly a wonderful IPA!","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"

Aroma is of oranges, pine, and hops. I could smell this all day! Flavor is hoppy with a complexity of citrus and pine.

You need to try it very, very cold-almost freezing, to bring out that awesome taste. Stone Pale Ale, I.P.A. and Arrogant Bastard Ale, are quite simply the finest beers in the world.

3885,"2003-02-10",3.8,"This hazy, orangey golden brew has a medium, white head. The nose is full with herbal hoppiness and the slightest nuance of maltiness.

3885,"2003-02-08",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2003 Reddish-orange, mostly clear (filtered?), disappearing head and light carbonation.  Aroma is equal parts sugary malt, sort of like pound cake, and citric hoppiniess that is lightly acidic.  The flavor profile is dominated by a pungent, sharp bitterness.  There's a bit of malt sweetness here I think, but more in the needle-in-a-haystack sense.  Rather harsh and reminiscent of bile.  The aromatic hops are quite nice, and I'm pleasantly reminded of the Arrogant Bastard, but I find this too acidic and bitter to be all that enjoyable.  I actually prefer the Ruination to this one.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"

3885,"2003-02-07",4.6,"I have not had a better IPA.  Stone Ruination IPA may be better in some very rigorous sense of the word.  It is like the Platonic IPA -- all others mere reflections, or maybe mixed with a touch of lager.  But this isn't intimidating and over the psychotic top like the ruination.  It's drinkable any time, requiring no mental steeling, no palate flexing.  Deep, slightly cloudy orange.  Looks rather like the beer on the cover of Michael Jackson's Ultimate Beer.  Beautiful.  Piney aroma, modest bitterness, basically, just incredible.","USA","document"

Flavors are better with some grapefruit and a touch of white grapes. Malt evident and welcome in the middle and finish to help balance out the hops. Quite smooth for the strength. Big yeast presents in both the aroma and the flavor at times. A full, strong IPA.  Original Rating (7,3,6,4,13 = 3.3)  Hazy golden orange color with a tight bubbled small beige head.  Sweet grapefruit with a hint of wet cardboard aroma.  Citrus and sweet (near cloying) flavors.  I would wager this is either old or heat struck.   Rats!","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

A little weak on malt character, but who said this was supposed to be a ""balanced"" beer?

3885,"2003-01-23",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2007 Hands down the best IPA Ive tried yet.  Fruity and amazingly complex aroma (IMO) for an IPA. Pears, honey, hops oil. Foamy white head on hazy dark amber beer with lacing down the whole side of the glass. Medium-heavy body with low-medium carb - great mouthfeel. The balance of sweet/tart malts/hops is incredible. Very fruity and huge hops finish with light bitter/fruit after. Clean and crisp - really perks you up.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

A wide variety of hoppiness fill the flowery/aromatic flavor.  Some citrus, like grapefruit, too.  The carbonation is just right.  There is not much head retention.  Very smooth and easy to drink.

Intense flavor, with the perfect malt to hop balance.  A great IPA, though slightly inferior to the Ruination.  Original, 3.9 - Nice color and lacing.  Decent aroma of hops and sweetness.

Full, bready body with a touch of malty sweetness that saves this IPA from tasting over-hopped. Distinctive grapefruit-juice-bitter finish. Clear, reddish-golden color. Leaves a complex latttice of lace down the side of the glass. About a thousand times better than the infamous Arrogant Bastard Ale.

3885,"2002-11-08",4.5,"Um, I dont really know what to say.  Ive been looking at beers for about a year and a half.  Finally, finally, Ive been privaleged enough to be able to try something from Stone Brewing.  I know all of the hype about the over-the-top Stone brews, so Im sitting here thinking, ""Wow, this is going to be big.""  Well, I wasnt wrong, but I wasnt exactly right either.  Stick your nose in the glass, and out comes this incredible piney, citrusy, floral hop aroma.  Behind it lies a subtle, sweet malt backbone.  Im certainly happy.  So, Im smelling this beer and thinking about how ill prepared I am for this moment.  As long as Ive been waiting (and wanting, desperately wanting) some Stone beers, I get one and Im timid and unsure.  Finally I take the plunge and just drink.  Oh how wonderful.  The aroma (and the reputation)tricks you into thinking this IPA will be insanely bitter and glorious.  Tons of citrus and pine and bitter flavor.  Ha, how wrong I was.  Sure, there are all of the characteristics of a good IPA--citrus, pine, flowers, perfume.  However, the malt is there, in just the right proportion.  Glorious, sweet beer.  How I love thee.  What a tremendous experience this beer, this Stone beer, has been.  I want so much more, and yet...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Medium to full bodied with a smooth palate and moderate carbonation, the flavor is hoppy at first, but is soon balanced some by the intense maltiness.

Taste was not dry, but a pleasant bitter just as an IPA should be.","Orange County, California, USA","bigal9699"
3885,"2002-06-02",3.8,"Quite complex, dry aroma.  Ridiculously bitter and hoppy, a bit too much for me but still a nice beer.  Try adding a splash of the smoked porter to this to make a smoked Indian.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"

3885,"2002-05-20",4.0,"This is a great IPA with a great hoppy aroma and the flavor to back it up.  The bitterness is strong but well balanced so as not to be harsh.  This is starting to get a wider distribution and if you see it, drink it.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

3885,"2002-05-10",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2012 I have no idea what I was thinking when I wrote my first review of this beer.  Although, in my defense, my tastes must have changed in the almost ten years since that review.  I completely deleted those initial comments, because my current thoughts about Stone IPA are completely opposite!  This is one of the best IPAs in the land!  It pours a light gold color with a straw hue and a large, sticky white head.  The head leaves a ton of beautiful and cascading lacing around the glass.  The nose is full of dry and spicy hops, with a truck-load of citrus and a touch of bready malts.  The flavors are dry and spicy, as well, with the citrus dominating.  I taste some orange peel, grapefruit, hop resin and a touch of earth and bread.  The finish is almost the best part, with all the dry and spicy hops, along with the grapefruit and orange.  This is a just a tremendously awesome IPA!!","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
3885,"2002-05-08",4.0,"A very malty example of the style.  First aroma that hit me was Tang.  It smelled like coming home from the pool on a hot summer day and fixing a glass of Tang and watching TV.  Served cold, the bitterness hits your mouth like a brick, but is soon subdued by the rising maltiness.  A well balanced beer indeed. Damn good.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
3885,"2002-05-04",4.5,"Had a bottle of this while working the grill.  This brew pours a clear golden honey amber.  The large fluffy almost white head is fully lasting with good lacing.  The bold perfumed nose is exclusively hops with grass, citrus, herbs, spruce, and flowers.  The flavor is very rich and complex while staying straightforward and exceptionally balanced.  The brew starts flowery with a sweet and fruity middle and a very long bitter bisquity finish.  The palate is stellar with  a medium smooth and soft body that is creamy and slightly oily.  The finish is very clean.  Stone is a MONSTER brewer.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
3885,"2002-04-30",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2003 12 oz bottle, light orange -copper color with a white frothy head, nice lacing. Clean citrus-pine aroma, medium body malty with a strong hop profile, nice balance, One hell of an IPA.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
3885,"2002-04-30",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2003 My wife was about to kill me for ordering these.  Not available in Illinois, so I had six of them shipped from California and it was worth every penny.  If you like IPA's, this is excellent.  The aroma makes you want to stick your face into the glass until you run out of air.  The flavor is very hoppy but also easily drinkable.  Dogfish head 90 minute IPA is the only beer I've had with more hop flavor but not near the aroma or smoothness of this one.  This is near perfect.

Just picked up a keg of this stuff.  Not as hoppy as my first impression, but a great overall beer.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"

3885,"2002-04-24",3.8,"Surprisingly pale in color; Head was thin and fleeting; Lots of citrus and pine in the nose. Surprisingly mild- this did not knock me on my ass with hops the way that I expected. Actually restrained. I am really surprised.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
3885,"2002-04-04",4.5,"Definitely one of my alltime favorites.  Humungus hoppy aftertaste that just kills your palate for any other beer on the planet.  But why would you want to drink anything else?","somerville, Massachusetts, USA","Hugerat"
3885,"2002-04-04",3.9,"Aroma is top notch extremely inviting hoppy aroma.  Malt flavor is quite well done, just the right amount of residual sweetness.  My main beef is that the hop flavor was quite different than the hop aroma.  I felt that it led to a bit of a disjointed drinking experience.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
3885,"2002-03-31",5.0,"This beer is the definition of IPA.  No uncharecteristic flavors like the Maritime IPA, just liquid hops.  What is particularly lovely about this brew is the enourmous hop-nose: I spent 5 minutes just SMELLING the glass!  Obviously a lot of dry-hopping, but hops is the main ingrediant at every level of this beer.  The flavor backs up the hops with a strong enough bite and carbonation to distinguish it from Trees IPA, which has no body behind the hops.  I had the Full Sail IPA the night before, and almost poured the bottle out for lack of hops.  God bless Stone Brewing for this perfect beverage!","Tacoma, Washington, USA","NWHopHead99"
3885,"2002-03-29",4.0,"Pours with a clear,dark gold color. Less citrus, more honey sweetness. Higher alcohol (6.9%). Modest head of foam, doesnt exhibit the cloudiness or level of sedimentation that other craft IPAs show. Sweet, yet bitter... and for those who find this brew lacking... then you are ready to graduate to one of the best beers on this planet; Stones Arrogant Bastard. Cant say that it is my favorite IPA, but it is pretty darn good and reasonbly priced at $2.99 per 22 oz. bottle.","Pico Rivera, California, USA","maxhits"
3885,"2002-03-25",4.7,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2007 Would it be excessive hubris to say that this embodies perfection in brewing?  Technically speaking, there is ""nothing wrong"" with, say, a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Its got all the nice qualities that make for a good beer, and its not weak or bad in any way.  But it just doesnt make for hop-nirvana, now does it.  Quite literally, by contrast, there isnt anything wrong with this beer.  Remember, after all, that SNPA is a normal pale ale, something any beer lover could settle for absent something better.  This, on the other hand, is an IPA, so the bar gets raised, and this hits the spot for what an IPA could be and ought to be.  And when ones favorite style appears to be IPA, and this one just doesnt cut any corners, well, youre left with a beer that has nothing wrong with it.  It is Excellence in liquid form.  As IPAy an aroma as can be had.  Beautiful appearance, small bubbles and spectacular lacing.  No weakness in the taste; the palate is flawless.  It simply doesnt fall short anywhere.  I tried to find where I might possibly downgrade it, but I couldnt, because it satisfied completely in every respect.  For brewing ""perfection"" of a related sort, you can refer to this brewers Ruination IPA.  I think that the tastes of Stones brewers happened to coincide with mine; I dont know how else to explain this glorious synchronicity between taste and fulfillment.  If IPA is your thing, youve come to the right place.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

3885,"2002-03-13",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2006 Draft:  First beer from this keg.  dense and creamy head that is very sticky.  aroma is floral, citric, touch of caramel, sweet, kind nuggets, nutty, pine sap.  flavors of ripe oranges.  like biting into a ripe, juicy orange, hop burp...something i hadnt had in a beer before this.  palate is very round and soft, juicy, extremely fresh and refreshing, yet very complex.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3885,"2002-03-05",4.9,"I had just decided earlier that IPAs available in 12 oz bottles were probably dominated by the great tasting Bridgeport and Big Daddy (Speakeasy). Then, I had Stones IPA.Great Stuff from the first to the last sip and a Hop saturation that I found very satisfying. I also liked not being able to single out the alcohol (like some other hopped-up Ipas and Double Ipas). Id actually give this a 20 but then Id probably never buy any other. Even the bottle looked cool. Congratulations Stone, on a terrific IPA.","Shingle Springs, California, USA","DamnGoodBeer99"

3885,"2002-02-24",4.2,"Modest orange in appearance with a frothy head topping this blissfully hop-aromed beer. A label on the beer states nothing but barley, hops, yeast, and water--what could be more simple?--Is this really all it takes to make a great beer--then why havent more brewers caught on?! Relatively smooth hoppiness that saturates all parts of the mouth, leaving a pleasant, but slightly metallic, hop aftertaste.  A wonderful all-around IPA with well balanced hopping.  One of the best.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

3885,"2002-02-11",4.0,"Sweet, pleasant (not powerful) aroma with nice color and clarity.  Has a nice balance between bitter and sweet (fruit) flavor.  Personally, I would have toned down the maltiness of this IPA a bit , but that is  a personal opinion.  There is a definite orange/tangerine bent to the flavor of this beer.  Hoppiness is there, but not as overpowering as some reviewers would suggest.  For me, the sweetness of this beer was more prominent than its bitterness.  Its not my favorite IPA, but overall, a very good beer-- I  definitely understand why this is such a highly rated beer.","Long Beach, California, USA","Wiblemo99"
3885,"2002-02-04",3.9,"A darn good IPA.  Solid hop backbone, but this beer is set apart by the malt character.  Deep caramel and slightly roasted malt flavors really make this IPA worth drinking.  The relationship between the hops and the malt -where some other IPAs fall flat IMHO - make for solid mouthfeel.  Another fine West Coast IPA","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

Very, very hoppy both in bitterness and flavor, but its actually overmatched by a malty sweetness.  Caramely, toasty flavor complimented by a smooth hop flavor.  Extra dry-hopping really shows.  At 6.9%, its way too strong for a session beer, a bummer since I want to drink the whole six-pack tonight!
