Bright green and hazy. Looks great.

Smell is bright citrus. Distinctly tangerine. Light acidity and bread.

Taste has the same intense tangerine. Very nice. Orange and light tartness. Simple, but tasty.

Light and well carbonated.

Simple and delicious.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3926,"2015-10-04",3.4,"Draft... Pegs Cantina Barrel Aged Beer Day  TBBW 2015 Cloudy lime-colored pour with a minimal, fizzy, white head thats gone faster than you can say quick. Looks a lot like Fantome Strange Ghost. The aroma is a blend of lime, vanilla and tangerine zest. Light to medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and faint carbonation. The flavor is basically watered-down notes of tangerine and lime. Its tart, but more thin and watery than anything else. Pretty good, but I was hoping for a lot more.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
