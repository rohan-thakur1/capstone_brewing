891,"2016-07-23",3.2,"Bottle. Pale yellow body. The nose is herbal and flowery with notes of alcohol. There is also some medicinal fruit character almost like over ripe pears. Flavors of light pears and subtle booze. There is also a nice earthy note in the finish. Slightly sweet with the warming alcohol. Pleasant enough but a little one dimensional.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
891,"2016-02-15",3.6,"Bottle, shared by me... in the library... just now.
Landmark rating here, with this I will have finished out all the non-beer styles! 


Pours very clear with just the slightest hint of yellow color to it. 

The aroma is unmistakably cedar like but also quite peppery, like in a peppercorn kind of way. Mild on alcohol in the nose with some light fruitiness, but mostly very wood focused.

The flavor is very different from what Im used to in a sake. Again its woody, but less overtly so in the flavor than the aroma. The sake is about a medium dry with light hints of fruity sweetness and vanilla character. The alcohol melds well with the flavors here but is certainly a very noticeable factor. There is a lot of that peppercorn thing going on here in the flavor as well. 

I really kind of dig it.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
891,"2013-11-05",3.6,"Bottle shared at Sushi Morikawa, The Hague. Pours pretty much completely clear. Aroma of pepper, wood, vanilla and rice sugar.

891,"2013-03-18",3.3,"Bottle - Pours clear with no head. Lightly spicy cedar nose, mellow rice with a little warmth. Taste has more of the cedar--its upfront with the mellow rice underneath and a little odd fruitiness. Very peppery, though smooth. Warming finish with just a bit of sharpness. Light-bodied and a little slick.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

891,"2012-06-04",3.8,"6/4/12. bottle from mekong. 

it pours about as crystal clear as off clear can be... thin looking.

great aroma.... milder than expected having been in a barrel... woody (but not distinctively cedar), mushroom, powdered sugar, sweet rice pudding, mild alcohol and lots of florals but not overly flowery. definitely picks up more cedar-like woodiness as it warms. 

the flavor is more of the same.... but quite subdued and mild.... not sweet... bubblegum notes, vanilla, scant tartness on finish.

powdery texture in an otherwise light mouth feel. im liking this a lot...","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

Enjoy the savory flavor of pure sake balanced by cedar barrel aging.""  I think this is the same since it states cedar aged, but some of the stats are different like this is 15% ABV and in a bottle not a cedar lined one.  The bottle is pictured here:
http://www.truesake.com/sakes/SP11_Ozeki_Ju poured a transparent clear body with no head or bubbles.  There is a mello woody earthy start and a stronger alcohol finish to the palate and flavor of this sake.  It starts out smooth then burns later.  It had a mild rice aroma.
