Nice thick head of creamy tan bubbles. Deep golden amber color in the pour.

The nose is bold and obvious. Full of ripe passionfruit and blackberries. The sweet aroma of the malt is lengthened by the the rapidly evaporating esters of the aroma hops which give the fruity aroma an appealing ripeness.

Nice hoppy mouthful. You get a a very consistently fruity palate all the way to the end. The true genius of this brew is in the way the freshness of the bitter hops is balanced with the ripe fruit flavor notes of the aroma hops all teh way through. You usually get aroma then bitter, but not here. The flavor profiles of both hops are sinuously intertwined from fresh beginning to satisfying end. A very good effort. Satisfying to try.
