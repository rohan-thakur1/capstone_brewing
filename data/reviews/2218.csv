Its aroma featured a strong presence of caramel, along with some herbal scents and spices, and a bit of straw and banana. The taste was mostly sweet and milky, with a strong presence of caramel, and some nice light spicing.

2218,"2015-01-13",3.2,"Pours a clear caramel color that lacks a head. The aroma is heavy on cinnamon and spices, along with some nutmeg, toffee, and bread. The taste is dry. There is nutmeg and spices up front, moving into orange, ginger, and cinnamon. Hints of breadiness, minor yeast and apple as well. The aftertaste is a short spicy apple flavor.

2218,"2014-10-22",3.6,"12oz bottle, from Dutchs. Half hazy amber orange color, a bit darker. Thin off-white head, leaving a few bits of lace. Really interesting aroma for an oktoberfest, much more complex. Drinks like an ale.. Medium body. Super smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Light slick. Super smooth and easy-drinking. Great flavor. Dulce le leche is a very creative thing to add to a Marzen, and it seems to add a ton of character here, that complements the natural caramel malt flavors of the style very nicely. Kind of a tropical fruity hop character. I dont know if its that fancy leaf contributing this, but theres also a nice touch of a kind of minty earthy herbal factor towards the finish... Awesome journey of flavor here. Moderate sweet taste, light to moderate bitter, lightly spicy. Very enjoyable, tasty, interesting stuff. Fruity hop seems to make this for me, as typically the style is too sweet... The taste here is much more balanced than your typical marzen, despite all the additions. I normally insist on pairing this style with food, but this beer was interesting and easy-drinking enough to hold up on its own easily. Much better than expected... Ive heard some people say that 5 Rabbits has gotten much better lately, and considering the last few things Ive had from them, I have to agree.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

A light dusting is left on the surface with a very light hint of lace. The taste is a light sweet and very light spce bitter. The beer is crisp, dry, and light with thin texture and an airy zip to the carbonation. It finishes with spice and bread, then cleans up quickly leaving only a touch of pepper on the aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Appearance a murky dark brown with not much head at all.  Aroma was sweet, definite caramel presence.

2218,"2012-01-06",3.3,"On tap at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL., and dispensed to a pint glass with a bright and clear, deep copper color, a modest amount of off white head foam that diminished rather quickly to a ring & film, and left some dots & dashes of lacing. The nose was sweetness, caramel, vanilla, a hint of banana, and pie spice less clove. The flavor started with a low but mildly lingering hop bitterness that was peppery & earthy, and then continued the aroma notes. The body was medium+, there was a light silkiness to the mouthfeel, and the texture was a little sticky. Flavorful, nice complexity, but considering the style line, a little sweet for me.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

2218,"2011-12-01",3.5,"Draft at Map Room (Chicago, IL). A treat to try a new 5 Rabbit brew. Pours a glowing lively copper hue, no real haze as the fiery appearance takes gold, frothy offwhite head sits atop and dies to a film, laces small overall. Aromas are spicy, nutmeg and faint cinnamon mix with some sweetness, caramel and toffee with some touches of dulce de leche sweetness, a bit odd, touch of toastiness and dryness from some gentle hops. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a touch lighter, offering sweet caramel and milk sugars, a touch of toast, toffee, and gentle earthy hops, spice, mellow cinnamon and nutmeg. A very unique brew, into the finish drying up a bit more with the help of earthy hops and gentle spice that lingers on. Certainly an interesting beer. In spite of that, the elements work and stay fairly balanced despite what you would expect to not work at all. Look forward to more from the 5 Rabbit crew.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2218,"2011-12-01",3.6,"5 Rabbit Vida y Muerte Muertzenbier
On tap at the Map Room for their 19th anniversary. Pours a hazed, copper-gold colored body with a finger-width, dense and foamy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is lightly toasted caramel with some grain and a light bread along with a nice, light spicing that balances well. Resembles pumpkin pie spices with some cinnamon and nutmeg. The caramel gives off a nice, light richness as well. Flavor is similar. Richer caramel with a light spicing up front. Some grains and a light earthy hopping come out in the middle as well as a bit of fruitiness. Caramel stays balanced, but gets a bit richer in the finish as the spicing increases slightly and helps this finish fairly dry, but balanced with a light sweetness. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium, smooth body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, all the 5 Rabbit beers Ive tried have all been really well balanced and fairly subtle. This is no different. Very well put together with a light, but rich caramel along with a nice earthy spicing. This wasnt the most complex or bold beer around, but I enjoyed it.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
