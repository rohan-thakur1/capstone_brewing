5000th RATE!Very lively lazily fobbing from the bottle and all over the tablecloth, Daisy wasn¬ít best impressed! In the glass its a lightly hazy bright amber- marsala like with a fluffy beige head that soon disappears. The nose is a little oxidised, sherry flor, wood, cardboard, a touch of mint like a few of the older Fullers vintages I¬íve had. In behind is a rich syrupy tinned fruit note and a little ginger. Zippy carbonation, big mouthfeel, quite minty, fruity, very little sign of its 10///5 and that bourbon is very much in a supporting role, the way it should be. There¬ís a tongue numbing almost peppery warmth to it, but little bitterness, its all layers of wood, Christmas cake fruits and malts.

2348,"2013-12-23",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Alcohol warmth and cake-y spices merge upon this brew¬ís vanilla and muddled fruitiness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy amber.
-Nothing stands out in the flavor profile; there isn¬ít a dominating character one can fall back on.
-Carbonation is effervescent yet soft.
-The bourbon-aged version was more expressive than the port-aged at this point in their evolution.
-Don¬ít know if this one is already past its prime, but its flavor clarity is clearly not optimal.

2011 bottle; thanks Ian!
Earlier Rating: 3/2/2009 Total Score: 3.6My Bottom Line:
Distinctive apple-like fruitiness and oak create Calvados allusions, as doughy yeast and lightly caramelized malts whip up a highly personable and expressive Belgian Strong Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy orangey amber.
-Alcohol is felt throughout, but does not bother the flavor profile much.
-A peppery spiciness is found in the last half.
-The body is well rounded and the carbonation very active, making for a soothing sipping experience.
-For now, I feel like there is so much going on in here that some flavors haven¬ít had the time to blend in with their companions. Maybe time will yield a more united flavor profile (to my tastebuds).

Bottle at Ebenezer¬ís. Many thanks Chris!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

2348,"2013-12-13",4.0,"33 cL bottle from Rosses i Torrades in Barcelona, served in a stem glass alongside the other two reserva variants. Pours hazy reddish orange with a small tan head that remains and leaves a small amount of lace. The nose has big brown sugar notes along with bourbon, oak, dark fruit, flowers and a touch of spice. The flavour is quite sweet with caramel, brown sugar, big bourbon notes and a touch of oak. Herbal, spicy notes provide balance, but it is really all about malts and bourbon. There is also a subtle sour fruit character and subtle vanilla. The finish is long and malty with spice and bourbon. On the palate, it is medium-full in body with a smooth, milky texture and average carbonation. Overall, a delicious bourbon variant of an already nice brew. Smooth and elegant, but with an extra touch of bourbon. Very well done. 2013-05-03Earlier Rating: 11/16/2012 Total Score: 3.92011 vintage. 33 cL bottle from Binnys Beverage Depot in Chicago, served in a tulip.

On the nose, there are aromas of fruit, candi sugar, toffee, spice, oak, slight funk, Belgian yeast and a hint of grassy hops. The flavour is moderately sweet throughout with caramel, fruit, grass, spice and candi sugar. There is also a big peppery alcohol complement. The oak becomes progressively more prominent towards the end. The finish is long and malty with pepper and oak. On the palate, it is medium in body, dry with an astringent finish. Overall, this is a great oak-aged triple. The oak adds a layer of complexity to an already complex beer.

2348,"2013-05-14",3.3,"Despite sitting in my fridge for months, a careful pour shows a hazy, murky, sediment laden, amber hue when held up to the light. The beer is topped by a frothy, light tan colored head. The aroma has a rich fruitiness to it that shows of pear jam, spicy clove, floral Macintosh apples, and, as the beer warms, some spicy, woody, Bourbon warming aromatic notes to it.

The beer is sweet, quite fruit laden, perhaps a touch spicy in the finish, but overall quite rich and satiating yet still managing to be more quaffable than a beer of this strength should be. Concentrated pear, apple butter, and perhaps some melon like notes mix with a softly spicy, lightly warming, barrel influence. Soft clove notes, some peppery notes, a woody astringency, and some spicy Bourbon notes.

The Bourbon character is actually quite a bit restrained here, it is pretty well integrated, though this still isn¬ít quite at the level that the regular Oak aged beer is at.Earlier Rating: 12/31/2012 Total Score: 3.7A soft pour into my Bruery tulip produces a three finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a rich amber hue that shows a brilliantly clear, perfectly amber color. The beer smells quite fruity, with lots of brandy, floral plum, even candied plum notes, cinnamon scented apple jam, and some berry like notes as well. Touches of malt character seem to have oxidized just a bit and they provide a spicy, caramelized note that reminds me a bit of crystal malt. The fruit character gets a bit more savory in character and this is also brought out by a bit more whole grain flavors. Some warm, spicy alcohol notes also become a bit more noticeable as this warms up.

Lightly sweet tasting, with lots of backing fruit notes that remind me of brandy, a sweet wine of some sort (port without the oxidation notes), and a backing, slightly spicy, grain / malt character. Spicy notes contribute flavors of ginger, a soft peppery note, a hint of earthy clove/coriander/allspice like notes, and a touch of woody oak character. The wood is actually quite subtle here, it does provide some spiciness  in the finish, and a hint of woodiness here.  The body of this has some viscousnous to it, though it is far too quaffable for a beer of this strength. The fruit character contributes notes of sweet raisins, prunes, concentrated grape notes, and lots of vinous grape notes.

This has a ton of vinous character to it, I would have guessed this was aged in something like a Port Barrel, or some other type of sweet wine barrel. Nicely rich, sweet, slightly savory, warming in its alcohol content, all of this adds up to a contemplative experience. Quite tasty, and a great way to spend an end to an evening.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Taste is malty, dense, thick, spice, muted alcohol. Easy to drink. Thick, silky palate reminds me more of Pannepot in density. I think saison is pretty ridiculous for the style here. Still, a well executed dessert beer with a decadent palate.Earlier Rating: 1/8/2010 Total Score: 4330mL courtesy of Santa! Holy mother. Pours with excellent carbonation for a barrel aged tripel. Maybe some bottle refermentation. Pours deep orange almost brownish like a very sickly and dehydrated man¬ís urine. Cloudy, bits of yeast floaties even though I left the yeast in the bottle. The thin, white head refuses to lace but retains a small protective layer. Aroma is awesome. There is white wine, champagne, some sourness, alcohol, lots of candi sugar turned into rum or somewhere in between the fermentation process. There is caramel, butterscotch and other sweets in the nose. Wow- extremely complex. Taste up front is rich with candy sweetness and caramel syrupiness. Then turns to some raw grainy dryness that stays throughout the finish. Upon first taste this literally set my ears on fire from the 10%. Woah. This is most certainly not your average yawn tripel.

2348,"2012-04-22",4.0,"Aroma of Garam Masala (confirmed this), alcohol, and musty yeast. ( the regular Tsjeeses smells more like cumin and coriander without the cinnamon and cloves in Garam Masala). That being said the obvious alcohol in the aroma detracts from it's good qualities. Both are hazy amber with small white head. Both are just a bit thin, but the Reserva less so. The Reserva is a lot more rounded and much sweeter. Chardonnay Barrels???Also herbal bitters are present in both but more so in the regular Tsjeeses ..  Just a touch of alcohol at the end which gives a hint of a phenol like tingling of the tongue like a sucrets, which is actually kind of pleasant. A sweet maltiness is noted in both the aroma and flavor of both versions.   Tsjeeses 7/4/4/7/16/38 vs  Reserva 6/4/5/8/17/40.  Got both bottles from Sun Devil and seriously doubt they are very fresh or well kept which could definitely drop my rating on the regular because I got the last regular Tsjeeses from Papago which takes much better care of there beers. 

Both were very pricey. The Reserva more so.

If it¬ís the only fact of a 6 months in oak barrels more (info of the website

First reason : no smoke at all (as in the single version)

Much darker than the regular version with visible carbonation bubbling up. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap.

Slightly earthy, spicy aroma with a decent malt backbone, slight medicinal character and estery fruit notes. Lots of spice, especially peppermint, cinnamon, clove, coriander and pepper. A nice combination of light and dark fruit but the darker fruits ae more prominent. Hints of cherry, apple, pear, grape, currant, plum, raisin and fig. Although these fruit notes are evident they are less prominent than in the regular version. The Reserva smells much more earthy and spicy and the aroma suffers a bit from this. There¬ís also more of a medicinal cough syrup and sweet alcohol presence.

Medium bodied and well balanced with a nice combination of zesty spice, caramel malt, estery fruit and alcohol heat. Tight carbonation up front with a lot of spice. Hints of pepper, corriander, clove, peppermint and ginger linger throughout into the finish. This is balanced by a slight creamy body with a medicinal and dark fruit flavor that adds complexity and fullness to the mouthfeel. I¬ím picking up hints of cherry, currant, grape, plum, raisin and other dark berries. The dark berries overpower the lighter fruits in this beer much more than the regular version and there is substantially a bit more alcohol sweetness and warmth in the finish.

Alas, only a few ounces survived the trip (through absolutely no fault of Phil¬ís!) and so I decided to sample the remainder on my lonesome (was hoping to bring this one to a tasting). Cloudy deep orange pour, some lingering sediment visible, and not much carbonation at all. Strong aroma of apple and yeast, like not fully baked apple pie with some serious tartness to it. Taste is a bit boozy, again laced by the tart apples and just a hint of spice. A bit of the wood comes through towards the finish. From what I can tell, nicely done, moderately tweaked yeasty tripel. Will actively seek out again.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

2348,"2010-06-08",4.3,"Bottle.

A - Cloudy, murky golden, orange, beige mixture for color. Fairly large foamy and creamy slightly off-white head. Average retention with a nice thin layer of foamy and sticky lace.

S - Wet grainy and bready malt. A touch of fruitiness (in particular apple and orange but some other golden fruit). Some woodiness and earthiness along with a good amount of spice and vanilla. Good amount of yeast and sweetness.

T - Similar to the nose. Bready pale malt and wet grainy taste. Fruity flavors present but not overly strong with apple and orange strongest but some peach, apricot, pear, etc. Some spice of clove, coriander, cinnamon and pepper along with a strong yeast flavor. 

M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Fairly smooth.

D - Very drinkable beer that is quite balanced. ABV is well hidden and it goes down easy.

Notes: Best before 12/12/12. Well balanced beer with a good amount of malt, fruit, and grain taste along with hints of woodiness and earthinesss. Not really like other BSPAs and it is pretty interesting, especially with the hints of woodiness.

The aroma had significant freshly-cut oak and lighter-skinned fruit tartness throughout.. light fruit meat, vanilla, and a pinch of molasses supported.. somehow soft on the nose despite the hefty components, which is testament to a well-made brew.  The flavor also found tart fruit skins and oak all the way through.. toffee, fruit, and vanilla supported.. white pepper and clovey spices joined more barrel character on the edges.. lots more fruity sugars on the finish.  Medium-plus bodied with tight, rolling carbonation on the palate.. I love what the spice notes and barrel character did here, but in the end there was just a little too much sweetness.

Pours a mostly clear orangish-amber color with a nicely formed off-white head and good lacing.

Aroma is really awesome with a lot going on.  Caramel, toffee, sweet apple, spice, and vanilla, with no one flavor too dominant over the rest.

Flavor is also very nice and balanced.  Caramel and toffee malt notes, with Belgian yeast, sweet candy apples, cinnamon and other spices, banana/fruity esters, oak, and vanilla.

2348,"2010-01-31",4.0,"(bottle shared by OSLO) Pous a hazy dark brownish gold with a substantial white head.  Aroma is potent with scents of sugar cookies, peaches, banana, honey, candi sugar, alcohol, and a substantial oak presence as well.  The bready yeast character is subdued on this one when compared with the regular Tsjeeses.  The taste begins with candi sugar, banana, pear, and stale bread crust tartness, that finishes out with a significant wood presence.  Spices are present too, and the oak successfully dries out all of the sweetness present in the mid-palate.  Mouthfeel is full and carbonation is lively.  Good stuff indeed, but the barrel tamps down the great yeast complexity which was present in the regular.  Thanks Al!","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

T - Not as overpowering a the smell would lead on, but definitely more complex than the standard Tsjeeses. Oak, apples and candi sugar, with the spice and alcohol taking the backseat.

M/D - Low carbonation gives the beer a sticky full mouthfeel and fits perfect for the overall flavor. The oak aging made this much better than the standard Tsjeeses. Unbelievably drinkable Christmas beer. I just wish I would have bought more bottles.

2348,"2009-07-13",3.8,"From the bottle flows a hazy, glowing, deep amber liquid, substantial in body and crowned with a whipped head of off-white froth.  Bunching at the edges, the bubbly foam leaves sticky, jagged lines of jagged lacing that resemble lightning strikes across the sky.  The nose is centered in well caramelized candy sugars, though soft, vanilla-laden oak asserts significant influence.  Funk and citrus elements present in the regular version are mellowed considerably by the assertive, yet delicate wood.  Flavors too are sweet, soft, and easy-going.  Bronzed, blonde candy sugar, oak, and distant hints of maple are most prominent, though some spicy citrus peel and faint coriander are also there.  Dangerously drinkable for a 10% ABV brew, the palate is both smooth and substantial, without any annoying stickiness.  A subtle alcohol burn is all that holds it back.

Rich hazy orange. Sweet caramel aroma, quite subtle. Soft palate, gentle carbonation. Sweet caramel retronasally. Very nice bitter bite on swallowing, leaves a tingly hoppy finish. Treacle caramel dominates the non-hop taste, but it¬ís not oppressively sweet fortunately. A lovely sipper, and covers the alcohol fairly well, probably due to the sweetness.

2348,"2008-12-19",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2010 Drank right after the Tsjeeses, and I think I am one of the few that prefers the original. Lighter color, hazy orange with another nice white head, more soapy this time and still loads of lacing. Very refreshing nose, more sour than tripel with the lactic and fruit dominating. The flavor is more like the regular Tsjeeses, tripel qualities returning while sweetly balanced with orange. The alcohol is also more of a factor, slightly distracting. A little stickier and dryer than the Tsjeeses, though still full bodied, smooth, and alive. Finish is more lactic, still rather long. This is delicious, but I think the brilliantly restrained harmony and sheer grape delight of the Tsjeeses have been lost while aging. Several tries later, it¬ís too hot, with too much off-setting syrupy fruit sweetness. Tripel is unmarried to fruit as well (see Splinter Gold for a shattering example).","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

i don‚Äôt know how he continues to get such a stellar array of beers but once again Mike came through with a Struisse release that is worth trying.  I hope at some point the regular Tsjeeses makes it to the United States so I can see what effect the aging has had on it.  This one is worth the hype if you can find it.

Aroma / Appearance - A cloudy brown body swirls fluidly around the glass releasing the smell of banana bread, fruit and malt into the air.  Complete in every way there is nothing lacking that I could find.

Flavor / Palate - The first sip was a rich blend of yeast, nuttiness, dark chocolate and a hint of woodiness.  The yeasty finish caps off an excellent experience that stands among the best in the world.  Hopefully this will be released again in wider circles.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2348,"2008-06-17",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2016 Drank this brew a couple of times!  Once on tap at the Waregem beerfest (08), and also at the Struise farm from a 75cl bottle.  Both tastings had a hazy orange/apricot color.  From the tap though, the head just exploded with a superb creamy head that settles into a thin layer.  The bottled was a little more restrained than on tap.  The aroma was absolutely stunning with hints of oak, refreshing butter, honey, vanilla, and loads of mango and apricot; alcohol was well hidden for 10%abv.   Mouthfeel is medium bodied, great carbonation with no apparent alcohol.  The taste had chewy fruit notes with a malty character along with a touch of vanilla and oak; what an amazing complex brew.  You would never know that this was 10%; I had no trouble polishing off this beer.  Gotta love this Tripel!!   Another great brew from the crew at Struise.","Blacksburg, Virginia, USA","ygtbsm94"

The beer pours a fantastic orange and reddish color and the beautiful off white head stay for ever on this most aromatic nectar. The smell is very complex with lots of cookie aromas touches of nuts, honey, spices (?),  red berries, wood, wet dog, sigarecase, some peppery yeast and ripe peaches. Taste is rich and elegant with hints of bread, croisants, red berries, pits of stonefruits, wood, cedar, mint and soft hops. A rich taste with a dry wood caracter that works perfect. This was the best of the session.","Dendermonde, BELGIUM","GilBier"

Incredibly huge nose of oak wine barrels, red grapes and black cherries... huge tannic nose, dry oak, deep, rich, extremely complex wine character on top of an equally impressive Belgian golden/trippel... but honestly the transformation of this beer from base version to reserva is a miracle... vinous, wondrous, smooth and rich, with a huge, tannic oak wine barrel dryness... amazingly deep and complex, a truly stellar beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2348,"2008-06-09",4.3,"750ml bottle at London tasting, May 2008. BBE 12 December 2012. Many thanks to Mes for this one. Poured a rather murky orange colour but I think I got the last sample so I¬íll forgive it that. Massive aroma - estery fruit, tangy hops, subtle spices, some vinous woody touches and even a suggestion of volatile Airfix glue. Not too much vanilla, which is fine by me as I often find oak aged beers have just too much vanilla for my taste. Taste is pretty much like the aroma - bags of sharp fruit. Robust body with a pleasant sweet (but not too sweet) and sour (but not too sour) mouthfeel. Oak aging frequently seems to me a bit of a gimmick, too often failing to add anything worthwhile to the underlying beer, but that is not the case here. The woody element combines with the fruity character together seamlessly. A beautifully crafted beer in very respect.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Slight wood, stunning vanilla, lovely alcohol, creamy caramel, barley sugar, incredible fruit and just an abundance of complexity. The balance is nothing short of perfect, there is so much going on but nothing jumps out at you. An easy 10.The flavour follows on well. There is some utterly incredible sourness from the wood.
