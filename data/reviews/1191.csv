1191,"2016-10-30",4.5,"Pours hazy, like grapefruit juice. Not much foam, really looking like juice and not beer. Aroma has grapefruit, green and weedy. Taste is totally smooth, feels like it has some herbal weed, white grapefruit in the big way. Everything flows into a prickly bitter finish, deep medicinal bitterness, long linger. Wow, thats the beer I would like to drink all the time. I mean if i had access to only this, would still be happy. Grapefruit seed finish, seed bitterness.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
1191,"2016-10-24",4.0,"Pours hazy gold with a white head. Aroma is citrus, earthy, tropical mango and more citrus. Taste is bitter with light sweetness. Medium bodied, slick texture and lots of lingering bitters on the finish. Excellent.","Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, USA","Leafs93"
1191,"2016-10-17",4.2,"Can shared. Thanks Kaori and Jon! Milky, white and yellow color (looks like peach juice). Huge white grapefruit forward nose with loads of kiwi, peach and light sulphur. Very juice like in body and texture. Creamy on the palate with more kiwi, papaya and white grapefruit. Bit of pith and seed on the finish. Almost no bitterness. Well-executed.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
1191,"2016-10-15",4.7,"Uber hazy, almost spoiled milk color. Super cloudy. Super full of white grapefruit and peaches with white wine and tropical fruit. The mouth is flawless. The acidity and bitterness is super reduced and subtle. Just a schooling of NE IPAs. So rounded the alcohol well hidden with some grape seed and peach stone in the mouth. This is unbelievable. This is just out of this world. Doesnt seem like a beer. Just juice. Beyond world class. Just unreal.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

1191,"2016-10-13",4.5,"Ive had the good fortune of tasting this twice recently. Thank you to Mark and Jon for sharing this wonderful beer.

Super hazy, murky orange body that can only be a New England IPA. The aroma is dank, resinous, massive assault of hops. Medium to full in body. Juicy, dank, awesome.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
1191,"2016-10-13",4.3,"Thanks Zack for the can! Poured into a taster showing unfiltered hazy whitish yellow with no head. 

The nose shows juicy oranges and pineapple.

The palate is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Flavors of juicy orange with citric notes with a strong citric zest bitterness.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
1191,"2016-10-08",3.8,"Big can in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma of fruity and citrusy hops, some pale malts, and some dough. Flavor the same with a lot of hops. Average texture. A good beer, but something about the hops doesnt blend as well as one would expect from Trillium.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
1191,"2016-10-03",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2016 At Trillium & Tree House tasting in Bruges, thanks Bart. Trillium DIPA generously hopped with Mosaic and Galaxy, with thinnish, loose, egg-white head that quickly dissipates, cloudy yellow blonde robe with peachy hue, almost looking like home made pear juice in the end. Aroma of granadilla, nectarine, pineapple slices, toasted onion, ripe mango, sweetbread, vanilla, pink grapefruit flesh, orange juice, green banana. Very lively fruitiness in the mouth, yellow kiwi, mango, papaja, lychee, pineapple, sweetish and sourish, softish carbo, light bready malt core, the honeyish sweetishness of which blends well with the aromatic hoppiness in the finish, pink grapefruit, granadilla, guava, elegantly bittering, bit resinous with a dash of warming, but nowhere interfering alcohol. Beautiful DIPA in which the typical properties of both hop varieties are cleverly positioned against each other and complement each other perfectly.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
1191,"2016-09-30",4.0,"16 ounce shared can. Pours a cloudy golden orange with a decent white head. Aroma of citrus and tropical. Taste is grapefruit, pineapple, tropical, pine, and malt. Delicious.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"

1191,"2016-09-26",3.8,"La canette de 500ml laisse couler un veritable jus dorange : blonde jauneâtre à lapparence très trouble, petite carbonatation et mince effervescence. Au nez, cest un jus tropical digne des meilleurs boites en carton de jus oasis, avec lorange, les pêches, des citrons et peut-être un peu damertume. En bouche, cest peut-être un peu decevant avec le nez extraordinaire quon vient davoir - grosse amertume, un peu dalcool, et peut-être pas assez de saveurs tropicales. Lamertume nest peut-être pas trop tranchante, mais prend certes beaucoup le dessus. Le houblon est présent, certes, mais plutôt discret, avec un petit côté citronné. Belle bière, peut-être un peu trop amère, mais toujours super agréable.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"
1191,"2016-09-23",4.4,"Can split at a tasting. Can was stamped 8-17 though, not 08-27. Pours a bright yellow/orange, cloudy, foamy white medium head. Aromas of citrus, tropical, and some onion and pine. Flavor was over ripe fruit, pungent, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, light pine and onion. Kind of reminded me of a kicked up Congress street with a mosaic twist. Full body, thick and sticky texture, soft carbonation, bitter pungent finish.","Jamestown, New York, USA","bigda83"
1191,"2016-09-22",4.3,"Can thanks to Branden. Pours a turbid orange yellow with small white head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is strong melon and pineapple. Medium body, incredibly juicy, mango, pineapple, dank hop, light bitterness, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
1191,"2016-09-08",3.8,"On tap at the tasting room. Cloudy/milky orangish/yellow pour with a white head. More tangy than Im accustomed too from Trillium. Grapefruit and citrus hop notes give way to hints of pine and resin. A bit more unbalanced with a bitter hoppy presence. Average mouthfeel with a good body.","Florida, USA","50belair"
1191,"2016-09-07",4.8,"16oz can pours a hazy bright yellow color with a bit of frothy head. Pure pineapple juice. Tropical fruit and nice bitterness lingering that balances so well. Not overly sweet.","California, USA","Bule"
1191,"2016-09-07",3.9,"Hazy/milky golden yellow color, thin white head. Aroma is of juicy mango, peach, orange, and citrus seed and pith. Initially bittersweet and becomes increasingly bitter through the finish. Moderate carb, light- to medium-body, and slightly oily.","California, USA","Ataraxia"
1191,"2016-09-06",4.4,"Pours unfiltered pulpy orange juice with a small white ring head. Deducting points from the appearance based on this. Nose is intensely citric, kinda tropical, with a boatload of hops to boot. Mouth is again super citrusy, mostly in orange and grapefruit peel. Like, intensely so to the extent of grapefruit peel oils and resin chunks. Hops attacking from every which way. Only slightly tropical with some mango, more about the citrus (even lime). Nice change of pace from all the mango bombs from Trillium and Tree House lately. The heavy haze and intense citrus create an almost acidic quality -- ironic that I traded old sours for this cuz I cant drink them anymore! Still, gotta give this one credit as its an intense experience and very, very good.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
1191,"2016-09-06",4.1,"16-oz can. Thanks, E&M! Pours a murky bright orange with a dense and sudsy off-white head that lasts for a while. Big forward nose, showing cheeba, grapefruit, pineapple, and some light spicy notes. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Lightly toasted caramel under a big wash of grapefruit, pineapple, cheeba, and spice on the mid palate. Long tangy finish. Beautiful beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1191,"2016-09-03",4.2,"Tasted on 9/2/16 from a 16oz can from the brewery, big thanks to Pete for sharing, and Happy Birthday!!! Pours cloudy orange with a thick white head that slowly recedes to average lace. The nose is the perfect balance of dank, citrus, pitted fruit, and tropical fruit, with some grassy herbal notes. The flavor is super grassy and herbal, tons of pitted fruit, tropical fruit, and citrus zest, just enough malt to provide a backbone. The body is nearly full with average carbonation, and a long citrus bitter and pitted fruit finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
1191,"2016-08-31",3.9,"Can. Pours murky orange with nearly zero head. Medium carbonation. Orange juice aroma. Citrus sweet with pine bitter.

The nose is so very juicy... passion fruit, mango, papaya, pina colada action and some pissy action. The taste is smooth, crisp, well-rounded, minerals, passion fruit, mango, light alcohol head, orange peel, grass and light toast with a dry finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation.

1191,"2015-09-12",3.0,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2016 Batch 1 750mL bottle from the source, drunk 9/12/15 (early birthday present to myself).Milkshake/semi-milkshake pour, despite 3 week cold fridge treatment. Very large white head audibly fizzles away to nothing...hmmm, thats weird and very un-Trillium-like. So now Im left with a headless, murky copper-apricot body.Galaxy very heavily apparent in the nose. Smells much like the Proclamation Derivative. And that smelled good albeit chalk full of galaxy, which I really detest. Fruity, yes, with mango and pineapple but theres that punchy, oniony quality to galaxy hops which is so uninviting. Really not getting much other than that. Malt seems well-attenuated as always, giving off light biscuits, pinches of honey and the yeast quality seems fine; no aspirin or any of that nonsense. Alcohol very well-concealed, as well, with no flaws.In the mouth its full of tropical fruits, light pine accents and strong lemony-grapefruit character. Basically all galaxy though a bit of apricot and earthiness break through on the end, compliments of the mosaic. Malts are rather sweet, with lots of pale malt sugars doing nothing to help this galaxy punchiness. Carbonation is fizzy and loose, very out-of-character for Trillium which usually excels at producing a creamy, ultra-tight textured mouthfeel. Instead you have a watery, slick texture that highlights too much maltiness. Bitterness is moderate to high, with some sediment dullness and more sluggish malt flavor. Alcohol pretty well in check, on the bright side, but thats about all I can say for this one.Damn, this is really uninviting and I see why absolutely no one wanted to trade for these. Same peculiar capsaicin-like spiciness that builds up on the palate and lingers. Barely finished one pour and the rest is going down the drain. Sadface.Batch 1, drunk 11/12/15.At a whopping nearly 3 months in the fridge, it still comes out soupy.  Sadly the head phenomenon was not the previous bottle only.  Still quickly fizzles to nothing.  Uh oh.  This dosent seem much better....Same heavily garlicy, cat pee and aspirin heavy flavor profile as before, albeit with two months for some of it to fade and the yeast to do a little houskeeping.  Ive had about 7 ounces and already I think the end is near for this bottle....Regarding the above ratings, it just reinforces small sample sizes skewing the perception of a beer; while I dont even like 4 ounces of this, its much, much more enjoyable if thats all you drink of it, as the garlic/catpee/aspirin/onion has no time to build up and the citrus and tropical fruits hold them in check.  As well, youre not bogged down by the extremely sluggish, thick maltiness.  That anyone likes this kind of hop schedule when there are beers like UpperCase and Mettle out there, blows my mind, but to each his own.  As well, this is nothing like the bright, fluffy texture/carbonation that Trillium is known for.  6/2/5/2/9Batch 2 on draught at the Canton brewery, 9/9/16.Still no head to speak of; it fizzles away immediatley.  Pure soup appearance otherwise.Still has that intense Galaxy nose to it, showing both enjoyable, spicy, dank, green notes and less enjoyable, twangy, lightly resinous, pine and tangy pineapple.  I still get a light medicinal/saccharine-like note to it, as well.  But as it warms and breathes, it opens up more allowing more dank, green, lush, juicy notes (mango and melon) to come forth, and leaving less of the undesirable character.In the mouth its soft, malty, well-attenuated though still lightly sweet.  Juicy and moderately bitter, with less punchy-twang than I remember (though some remains).  Better texture, which was one of my biggest complaints last year.  Tighter carbonation here, for sure.  Good, but definitely on the low end of beers I like from Trillium. 7/3/7/3/14.  Score is an average of two years.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
