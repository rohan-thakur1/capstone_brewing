Very short cereal aftertaste. This is light to medium in body, with a smooth texture, and average in carbonation. Kind of refreshing actually.

There was a bit too much of a quality, which the best description I have for it is: mineral and rye.  The aroma is quite buttery and light, not so unlike a bag of popcorn, but with estery fruit, lemony grass, and rye toast as well. It poured with a fluffy layer of creamy white head that mostly dissipates, fair carbonation, a slightly watery appearing body, and a crisp lemon yellow color. The body is decently balanced, light, but not watery, though not as quenching as it could be. Getting passed the hint of metallic minerals and off-rye grain up front, some decent notes come through after.

Nose is bready and faintly pleasant with a fairly-large amount of fruity notes for the style. The taste is more toward the bready end of the spectrum with a bit of fruit and a very mild bitterness in the finish. Body is light but more toward medium than it should be. Carbonation is a tad bit low. Drinks pretty well overall, but is just good, not great.

239,"2011-01-02",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2011 Re-rate: 12oz bottle. Pours a crystal clear, straw-yellow colored body with a finger-width, frothy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma has a good amount of lemony florals with a lightly sweetened honey-pale malt with some grain. Just a touch of herbal hops with some apple as well. Flavor is similar. Lightly sweetened, pale, honey malts up front with some grains. More lemon and a good amount of florals giving off some pear and white grapefruit. Finishes clean and dry with a touch of honey-wheat and a very light grassy bitterness. Medium length aftertaste following a light, crisp, smooth body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a solid Kölsch. Very easy drinking and enjoyable. Not crazy complex, but a lightly sweetened, honey-grain maltiness is balanced well with a floral, lemony crispness.

A light lemon-citrus-grass before this finishes with a clean, light, dry bitterness that leaves a medium length aftertaste. Light, crisp body and moderate carbonation.

The brew is a pale yellow, similar to ginger ale. It tastes lemony, quite light and refreshing. It is quite carbonized, not adversely affecting the palate.

I cant say that Ive had all that many different examples of this style, but this is a good beer, refreshing and summery.  It pours a somewhat hazy pale yellow, somewhere between maize and madder yellow.  Head is sudsy, relatively small and white.  The aroma is pale malt-sweet with a mild vinous character.  Id prefer a bit more grape, but its a minor complaint.  A tiny bit of butterscotch sneaks in as it warms.  Flavor is fairly sweet, but theres a nice grassy noble hop bite in the finish.  This is a refreshing beer that doesnt try to overwhelm you with flavor.  Good for a hot day.  Mouthfeel is light, airy and a touch slick.  Good beer though Im still not entirely won over to the style.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Aroma seems sweet at first, but after a couple of sniffs it reveals the wheat, corn, malt, and a hint of yeast.  Very smooth and refreshing, rather present aftertaste that lingers in a good way.

Pours a hazy straw color, with a steady stream of bubbles feeding a slightly fizzy white head. In the glass, theres a slight fruity smell of a warm ferment. Fruit is more prominent in the first sip. A nice biscuity malt body thats easy drinking. Spicy hops (the label now refers not to Tettnang, but Santiam, an American hybrid with Tettnang in its lineage). Stands up well against the more established Goose island Summertime. Taste is fresh and sunny, and goes down easy, even if its just a little gassy afterward.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Surprisingly full bodied for the style and considering how pale it is. Crisp spiciness up front with a nice bit of floral hops followed by a yeasty bready body with hints of pilsner malt and light crisp fruit notes, mostly apple and banana.
