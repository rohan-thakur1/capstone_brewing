1324,"2014-02-04",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2014 Draft sampler at the brewpub on August 7, 2013. Very dark brown/ruby hue, tan head, good strong aroma of malt and dark fruits, medium body, easy to drink but with character and some depth, flavor of malt, fruit, mustiness (in a good way), coffee finish. The best of the flight of Front Streets year round brews. I hope to return sometime and try some of their other beers, especially the more ""advanced"" sampler.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Drjohnrock"

Taste has the caramel coming through, and finishes slightly sweet. Very drinkable.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
1324,"2013-05-13",3.4,"Said to be their flagship.  And pretty good stuff.  Great dark brown appearance with a creamy brown head.  All malt in the flavor - leaning towards the caramel and maybe darker varieties.  Not my style, but it certainly passes the test.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","gonzosauce"
1324,"2013-04-20",3.5,"Hickory Hops 2013 - walnut pour, nice head/lace. Malt and silo nose. Big sweet malt with a touch of alcohol and big hops to finish. Nice barnyard touch! Full body and complex. Nice.

1324,"2012-12-11",3.5,"Poured into tasting glass.  Pours a nice dark dark amber color with an off white head that leaves good lacing.  Aroma is nice of dark fruit, toffee, maybe some chocolate sweetness.  Flavor is initially sweet with some dark fruit, chocolate and malt that turns into a nice smooth bitterness.  Mouthfeel is full with a not as much carbonation.  Delicious beer.","North Carolina, USA","Sikash"

1324,"2011-08-25",3.7,"Mug at the brewery. This is a pretty good interpretation of the style. Its on the woodier side with some roasty notes.  Toffee and bread are also present. This malty ale is well balanced and finishes earthy and very nutty, like almonds with black cherry hints.  Honestly one of the scottish ales Ive enjoyed the most.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1324,"2010-04-26",3.7,"Serving: Draft.
It pours a ruddy brown with a small, tan head.  The nose is unexpected with notes of smoke, peat, caramel, and malt.  The caramel and malt aspects take over on the tongue but the smoke and peat are still there.  No discernable hop prescence.  Medium, smooth body with a medium, malty finish.  I think this is a very solid beer and a very enjoyable example of the style.  Definitely worth giving a go!","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"
1324,"2009-09-13",3.4,"A very nice example of the style from an unexpected source. Dark brown pour with glimmers of ruby topped with a dense smoky ivory colored head. The aroma is earthy, peaty, with hints of anise, black licorice and smoke. The taste is the same with a thick, smooth, under carbonated body. Pretty nice brew.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1324,"2009-08-28",3.5,"Draft  Dark Brown, thin white head.  Caramel malt aromas warm to swirls of sweet smoke throughout. Soft chocolate-coffee roast and  sweet toffee flavors gain a backend smoke component in the finish.  Medium bodied with soft carbonation.  Nice, but the 80 Shilling has it by just a touch","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
1324,"2009-07-10",3.3,"Nicely done.  Deep brown with hints of red; off white head, great lacing.  Aroma is dark fruit, brown sugar, only hints of hop.  Medium bodied (couldve used some more), malty yet dry with a bit of sweetness at the finish","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
1324,"2009-06-16",3.2,"Pretty good, this was much more substantial than their other beers. All caramel malt flavor was kind of boring though. Some raisin and dark fruit flavor, but no hops or anything else. Light carbonation and lightly sweet.","Clemson, South Carolina, USA","wcampbell"
1324,"2009-05-09",3.8,"Draft at WBF Raleigh on 5/2/09. Rusty brown pour underneath a small tan head. Aroma is light peat, caramel, and chewy malt. Rather pleasant. Taste is more caramel, thick malt notes, soft peat, dark fruit and brown sugar. Body is medium overall. Soft bubbles on the tongue. Finishes with  more caramel, dark fruit, peat, and chewy malts.

The flavor is bright, with chewy malts, sparkly carbonation, some smoke. A very solid effort, pretty much a true Scotch Ale.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1324,"2008-12-05",3.6,"Slightly cloudy brownish pour with a dark cream colored head. The glass I had had some lacing present throughout. Somewhat non-descript aroma of roasted malt, raisin caramel. 
On a side note, none of the beers I tried at the Brewery has much of a nose to them. Not sure if it was me or the atmosphere.
Roasted malt, toffee, raisin flavors. Some charcoal especially through the finish. Mild warming from the alcohol, but I did not think it was very present other than that. Brought a growler home of this, but that was more for the souvenir and the Octoberfest would have been worthy of bringing home also.","from Michigan now in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","timsilvia32"
1324,"2008-08-16",3.2,"Pours a dark opaque brown color with minimal wititsh head. Very sweet caramel aroma.  Flavor slightly bitter, some smoke, and sweet malts.  Tad bit of molases.  Decent beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","roder60"

1324,"2007-11-28",3.5,"The growler (courtesy hopscotch) poured out clear dark amber  garnet  brown with tan head and mild lacing. The aroma is mildly earthy, mildly smoky and contains some burnt malts. Nice yet mild. The taste starts with roasty malts and mild burnt malts that are only mild players in the flavor arena. Midway a mild smokiness pops up along with faint earthiness. Nice sessionable brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1324,"2007-11-27",3.8,"Courtesy hopscotch. Growler. Pours dark and a little watery with a small head. Big dry chocolate aroma with a touch of single malt peat. Very smooth chocolate malt, roasted taste, finishes very nice with a good mouthfeel. Very nice.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1324,"2007-11-25",3.3,"Thin, mostly receding, light tan head. Translucent but very dark chestnut body. The aroma is roasty, with a majority of the sweetness chocolate, the minority caramel. Light English hops and minor alcohol noted. The flavor is also quite roasty. Sweetness is medium, bitterness low, astringency low, altogether pleasant but forgettable. Mild stale coffee is enveloped by smokey and roasty grain. Finishes lightly bitter, with lingering roast and caramel. Chocolate crumbles delve in and out of the sensory realm.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
1324,"2007-11-18",3.6,"Courtesy hopscotch.  Pours a dark brown with a small, off white head.  Smells of sweet dark malts, maybe just a touch of a little smoke in there too.  The flavor was alot of the same, but had an added little mintiness to it.  Very nice and refreshing brew.  Definite clove presence along with other spices.  Pretty solid scottish ale.  I liked the uniqueness of it.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
1324,"2007-11-18",3.4,"Nice mahogany color, good lacing. Aroma is peat, leather, and burnt coffee. Taste is Smoke, malt with thin mouth feel. Subtle hint of cigarette ash. Good, but loses points for cigarette taste.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Edmoe"

1324,"2007-07-08",4.0,"This beer is very good. Pours incredibly dark brown with a nice light brown head. Aroma is heavy on earth, soil and some wood. Taste is a creamy blend of Soil and huge peat with some light smoke but just a touch so as not to overpower rich and powerful taste gives way to a semi-sweetness of the malts and ends with a very pleasing bitterness.
