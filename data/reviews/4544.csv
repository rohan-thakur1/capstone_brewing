Getrunken am Budweiser Marktplatz vom Fass in den dort kategorischen Halblitergläsern. Die satt-goldene Farbe, das fruchtig-malzige-hefige Aroma, der vollmundige Antrunk mit blumigen Anklängen und dezenter Würze machen schlichtweg süchtig! Wenn dieses unpasteurisierte Bier überhaupt eine klitzekleine Schwäche hat, dann ist es die Lieblichkeit, die für den Dauergenuss etwas zu süß ist. Lecker!","Köln / Cologne, GERMANY","Shaney"
4544,"2011-01-09",3.0,"On tap at Monks Café Sveavägen in Stockholm. Not sure if I have the correct beer, it said Svijany Soukromý on the tap. It poured a cloudy golden liquid with a medium sized fluffy white head. Smell of light malts and herbs. Taste of hay, grass and it had a strong herbal bitterness. Medium thick body, semi-smooth mouthfeel and medium amount of carbonation. Also fairly dry. Nice Czech, dry and bitter. The finishing bitterness was surprisingly strong and aggressive which was the best part of this beer.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"
4544,"2010-08-23",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2010 Draught at Svijansky Rytir in Prague. Cloudy gold, glowing, with the fine, pillowy head. Creamy, malty aroma with butter, soft malts, citrus, grass, and honey. Soft, smooth palate with rich malt. Creamzy, with honey and cake, rather sweet, with almost enough hops. Estery (peach) and fruity. Good stuff--probably better if not consumed on a hot afternoon.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"

The taste is pretty good but quite sweet, plums, sweet malts which hold up the body of flavour, yummy soft candies, something resembling lemon meringue - no crust, soft, acceptable spice with hints of weak pepper, sour apple on the finish. There is a shit load of carbonation here that is perfect, medium bodied, leaves a bit of a pasty coating","USA","jorgeenmerich"

4544,"2008-07-20",4.3,"I’m not a fan of lager beer, I found them very alike one to another until I visit the Chzeck Republic, I found many nice surprises and this beer was one of them. First of all an entire aroma of malt and hops, because it’s a non pasteurized beer, many organoleptic features remains, yellow opaque colour and frotty head make an excelent combination. Taste is very much up the average fresh and bitter in exactly propotion to made a unique experience. The end is simply enjoyable, biterness and aromas play together in your  tongue  Definitely, Chzeck know how to brewer lagers.frothy,","Mexico City, MEXICO","chilangoglobal"

4544,"2008-04-07",3.3,"Back from a Czech Republic pub-crawl this is part of my express ratings for the typical Světlý 11°- (Czech light Pils), Světlý 12°+ (Czech Pils), Polotmavý (Czech Amber Lagers) and Tmavý (Czech Black Lagers).  Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at Klub Skorpion, Pilsen, Czech Republic 
The look: Partly cloudy golden body with a medium white head
To me a typical Czech Světlý 12° and above is: Well malted body with plenty of biscuits and cereals.  Sweetness level is in the light-medium range with some honey flavours and a light caramel presence (3/4 honey, 1/4 caramel).  Fruity flavour limited to a light citrus flavour.  Medium carbonation.  Finish is dry and moderately bitter with a light citric touch.  After-taste of dry grassy/herbal hops with a light dry spiciness character.
This one: As above but with a stronger fruity citrus/orange presence.  Less bite than most Světlý 12° but more refreshing and highly drinkable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4544,"2008-04-04",3.1,"En fût. Pinte dégustée chez Klub Scorpion (Plzen, Rép. Tchèque). Arôme: Odeur de levure et de céréale. Apparence: La couleur est blonde très légèrement voilé. Présence dun moyen col mousseux et dune fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût de céréale avec une pointe dhoublon. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement onctueuse. Faible effervescence en bouche. Arrière goût houblonné. (Rating #1556)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
4544,"2008-03-27",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Floral, citrusy hoppiness grows within the doughy yeast and crisp cereals until a riveting spicy hop bitterness motivates you to take another even bigger gulp. This is another very good Pilsener from Svijany, even if its not quite as compelling as their Rytir Bitter.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam floats atop the lightly hazy pale golden.
-Some diplomatic honeyed sweetness leaks from the malts.
-Feeble tartness increases drinkability and fits with the fruity hoppiness.
-The body is rather lean and could have a better build.
-Balanced is achieved throughout, which is to be expected in Svetlés of this quality.

4544,"2007-08-01",4.1,"Beautiful golden slightly hazy body, fine white head, fine lacing; Very special apple cider (dry Spanish) yeast aroma that grows with time in the glass to becoming almost Rodenbach like, backed perfectly by malt and hop; Big perfect carbonation on fresh full body, super balanced and complex; Long fresh soft finish, bitter and slightly malty sweet, the yeast is present, a little to little hop in finishing aroma.
