287,"2017-03-04",4.9,"Floral heavy headed hops. Has hints of a triple IPA in its finish. Reminds me of Hop Stoopid with a bigger price tag but also a freshness that sets it apart. Super complex palate which can be hard at 100 IBU but totally pulled off. This is as good as hoppy bears get. Reminds me of Pliney but with less citrus and more mango/tobacco hints.

287,"2017-02-14",4.2,"Appearance: Deep orange body. Hazy looking with a 1 finger head (more foam/lacing when i pour in my wifes glass) and very active carbonation.

Smell: Citrus fruit, more specifically fresh & ripe mango. Good piney hop smell but not overpowering the other aromas. Very good.

Taste: Im hit with the fresh mango again and i literally get a mental image of eating a mango. A slightly sweet fruit taste with some peach fuzz as well. Some discreet pine and my wife says it has a peppery feel to it. The taste definitely more than backs up the smell.

Mouthfeel: Good balance between malt and hops but tends more to the malty side. Almost no bitter hops which disappointed me a little but nonetheless i cant argue that this is a greatly constructed brew. Very smooth and feels a little juicy. Bitterness opens up a little as it warms.","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"
287,"2017-02-12",4.1,"Had to pick one of these 22oz at a local beer store to see what the hype was about. I can see this being made to compete in beer competitions. Pours a medium to light amber with rich orange hues with a slightly cloudy appearance. The head comes out strong and thick holding its own for about a minute then slowly melting. The hop aromas are very strong and complex. I get pine, grapefruit, pineapple, caramel, juicyfruit, grapefruit (sooo nice!). The flavors here were a little bit of a sad sad dissapointment for me. I have had sooooo many ipas and dipas and I find that most do not get much higher than an 8 for flavor. This one fails to make it any higher. I dont know if its the big caramel backbone or possibly that it has aged past its prime but man, I could or should be even better! Ok so theres the medium pine/citrus/apricot/ slight mango and high caramel backbone with just a ting of alcohol in the finish. Im hoping I just got an older bottle of some kind. Medium sweet medium to high bitter finish. Ive made dipas that taste almost the same as this one and most of my beers are on the level of decent.

287,"2015-07-31",4.1,"Yields an amber, sunny clear color, with a solid, fluffy white head.

Smells of ripe red fruits, featuring apple, peach and blood orange, well accentuated by lime rind. Exhibits a resinous sweetness, blending outstandingly well into the beers dough malts. Hoppy fruitiness defines the nose most pleasantly, together with a toffee sweetness on top of it.

Has a lower carbonation, showcasing a powerful mixture of distinct hops and sweet, well pronounced malts, offering the palate up to an extreme, huge but focused IIPA.

Begins with a very soft, aqueous note, bringing riper fruits from the nose to the palate, effectively balanced by bready, slightly earthen malts, which then turn suddenly honey glazed sweet. The prominent malt backbone defines how the hops evolve on the palate from that point on, pointing out features of ripe red apples, mango, water melon pulp and lemon coated peach, still accentuated by a dry earthiness. During the finish, the beer looses its slick sweetness, in favor of a pungent, leafy lemon dryness, pumped up by a bubbly carbonation. Hoppiness reaches its peak at that stage, numbing the tongue for a short glance, returning its initial aqueous characteristic with a well pronounced, long lasting lemon dryness to it.

This is an extreme, and extremely well build, beer. While it inherits typical double ipa features of a resinous sweetness, its tropical hoppiness lurks underneath, waiting just for the right moment to take over the lead. Both ingredients not only blend flawlessly together, but feature an amazing clean, powerful flavor profile on their own.","GERMANY","aleigator"

I got this in a trade about two years ago.
I poured half of this into a tulip and about the other half into a snifter.
The appearance was a nice looking hazy to almost transparent looking golden orange to brown with a decent looking sediment rolling around and within the carbonation. The head is fairly a white to an off-white sort of fluffiness filling the top of the glass evenly and ends up leaving a decent sort of white foamy lacing all around the glass.
The smell was an authentic sort of citrus hops to somewhat a nice caramel maltiness that doesnt leave anything to be desired. It does what it needs to do.
The taste was a pure bittersweet and does what it should to please the tastebuds in a very nice showing of citrus to caramel-ness coating them. There is a slight aftertaste of bittersweetness, but isnt overbearing. There is a quick dry finish.
On the palate, she sits about a medium with a sipper sort of sessionability to it. The carbonation is quite fulfilling and nice.

Aromas of grass, grapefruit, and mango come off the initial pour in strength, with a secondary aroma of milky caramel (kinda like a caramel candy) and some candy fruit notes. Later on into the first pour, some peach and strawberry notes poke through. It pours a clear sparkling honey-gold color which does turn a bit hazy near the end of the bottle (I wasnt expecting any unfermented proteins, so I was a bit aggressive with the pour), this is topped by a huge, fluffy, slightly off-white head thats perfectly content to linger for quite a while; although, when it does finally reduce, it reduces to a very fine film atop the beer, but, surprisingly, it leaves an abundant lacing. Tons of bitter in this one with a substantial sweetness too. I felt like there was even a trace amount of sour, but it was overwhelmed by the sweet and bitter. The full-bodied beer starts off with a mellow floral bitterness up front with some bittersweet grapefruit. The soft carbonation keeps this pretty smooth and creamy going down, with a touch of stickiness on the lips. At the swallow, a sweet caramel and candy fruit make an appearance, but this is quickly overrun by a strong grapefruit astringency. This is a punch in the face bitter, so beware! This bitterness sticks around for the very dry finish; although it does mellow quite a bit - either that, or your palate just becomes adjusted to it.

Doesnt match up with the description as Id hoped. Anyway ... Taste: sweet caramel malty up front, plenty of bitterness that lasts and lasts and lasts. Alcohol makes itself felt as well.

287,"2013-10-05",4.2,"Had on-tap at Kumas Corner in Chicago. $10 for a pint.

Appearance: A very cloudy yellow color with two fingers worth of a fairly creamy head. Lacing is here-and-there, but overall, it looks excellent in the glass.

Smell: Hm. Not bad at ALL, but not as fantastic as I was expecting, given other reviews. The peach/guava/tropical fruit are definitely there, but not in as big of a way that I wanted.

Taste/feel: Man... I love the assertive bitterness of this beer. I really, really do. The same fruit in the aroma comes in the beginning of each sip and offers the taste buds a lot of sweetness. The taste of Dreadnaught is what I wanted in the aroma, if you get me. Next is a split second of grassy/piney sorts of hops before finally just going away, leaving a lingering bitterness and warmth at the back of the throat that makes you desperately want another sip to wash that slight warmth/burn away... but then it comes back. So you sip again. And again. And again... Keep in mind that I find that to be a good thing. Thats not a con.

My score may not really show it, but I was slightly disappointed with Dreadnaught, despite the fact that I still liked it. A lot. Id be curious to see what this tastes like out of a bottle to compare. This beer is worth your time.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

Great hop aroma full of tropical fruit. Orange and mango along with some pineapple and tangerine. No malt at all with hops providing all of the aroma. Truly outstanding.

This hop dominance carries over into the taste. A huge rush of juicy tropical citrus that never really goes away. Orange and tangerine along with a touch of pineapple. A very light touch of bread in the background from the malt but it remains restrained and allows the hops to shine. A moderate bitterness and a slight warming in the back of the throat from the alcohol. Finish a pretty crisp and dry considering the abv.

Pours lightly hazy bright orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, floral, grass, light caramel, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops flavors with a light-moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, slick, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warning noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA! Fantastic complexity and balance of citrus and tropical hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and very smooth and fairy crisp to sip on for the gravity.

287,"2013-07-14",3.6,"Pros: this beer rocks! The taste is kinda bitter. However, the booze in this beer will have you ""feelin it"". 

I do not recommend more than 2 pint glasses of this beer.

Cons: the price $10.99 for a 22 oz is kinda steep

I enjoy this beer exclusively at the horseshoe casino. If you're lucky the barkeep will mistakenly serve this to you in a pint glass and you will have a really good time.

I recommend apocypalyse cow over this beer

I have much respect for this beer though

T - Just an onslaught of tropical and stone fruit. Papaya, peach, and lychee seem to dominate. Candied citrus, mango. A soft caramel malt backbone marries perfectly with the hops. Green pine seems to grab onto the edges of the tongue creating a slow build of bitterness that carries through the finish. The finish is more pine/grapefruit forward and dries out nicely.

M - Thick dense body, low to medium creamy carbonation. Dry finish.

Juicy would be one word to describe this beer. A very complex mix of aromas. Dreadnaught seems to be more dedicated to the aroma and flavoring hops while still providing an impressive bitter finish. This reminds me of a hoppier Maharaja. Wish I would have picked up more.

Nice combo of bitterness with just enough caramel sweetness to offset.  Mildly sticky, but still very drinkable.  Very good, but in my opinion not quite up to expectations based on what I saw others post.  It is hop juice and I appreciate that, but while very good there wasnt a huge wow factor for me.

287,"2012-12-26",4.4,"Oh Lordy, the day has finally come for me to try this beast - Bomber courtesy of pellegjr, serious thanks to Joey for this! 
Pours a hazy orange/amber with medium sized long-lasting white head; plenty of lacing throughout. Aroma is a huge hit of citrus fruit with touches of apricot, orange, a (surprisingly delicate) note of pine resin, and a lick of sweet caramel malt. Taste brings all those wonderful citrus fruits together into a pithy grapefruit and orange attack with some lighter more tropical stuff happening further back on the palate. Caramel malt sweetness is so lightly done that it lets the wonderful hops do the talking whilst keeping a little bit of balance. The hop bitterness is intense but by no means overpowering; a cracking, mouth-covering grapefruit and pine bitterness lasts long into the aftertaste - this is bitter, as an IIPA bloody well should be!  Mouthfeel is medium/full with medium/heavy carb. Absolutely no hint of alcohol anywhere near this, brilliantly disguised. Finish is deliciously medium-dry. This is world class, no doubt about it, more or less lives up to the massive hype that surrounds it. Thanks again to Joey for giving me the opportunity to give this a go.","London, ENGLAND","Beermack"

Live tasting bomber into Duvel tulip.. Huge thanks to rmcnealy for this one!

Appearance; pours a lovely hazy golden orange color with two fingers of loose off white colored head... Retention is decent, with a fairly thick film clinging to the top of the beer after a few minutes.. Lacing is solid with nice healthy clumps of lace clinging to the glass.

Smell; very subdued unfortunately, was hoping for a much more present aroma, unfortunately no bottle date to be found so im uncertain when this was bottled... An intense whiff yields pineapple, mango and some citrus.. A slight bready/yeasty aroma is also noticeable.

Taste; resinous notes are my initial impression, with pine being a primary component... Pineapple, mango orange and peach make a brief appearance... 

Mouthfeel; effervescent carbonation makes Dreadnaught feel lively in the mouth with a crisp finish and a slightly lingering bitterness...

Overall; I may have sat on this bottle a touch too long... Was originally waiting for a friend and finally said to hell with it and opened it up... I enjoyed this but definitely feel like a more fresh sample would have a lot more going on.. Would love to try another for comparison but at the moment I am unfortunately, a little underwhelmed given the reputation of this brew...","Missouri, USA","Thingus"

287,"2012-05-17",4.3,"700th Rating!  Bomber purchased at Bourbon & Canal in Terre Haute, Indiana while on a business trip there last month ($10.29). Pours into small hotel glass a somewhat murky light amber color with a half finger of white head.  Aroma of sweet fruits (mango and citrus just as the label says), honey, fresh-cut grass, fresh-cut flowers, alcohol, and some dank hoppiness.  Flavor includes notes of sharp citrus (ruby red grapefruit) as well as sweeter and more mellow fruits (peach and tangerine), notably spicy hops, pine, and toasted caramel.  Though bottled, the hops have a very fresh quality, reminding me somewhat of a wet hop ale.  Strangely, the flavor actually improved as it warmed up.  The significant malt backbone leads to a remarkably well-balanced big beer, with a nice mixture of bitterness and sweetness.  Smooth and restrained considering the big ABV (though some detectable booze in the nose).  This is quite different from the really hop-heavy FFF Arctic Panzer Wolf that I tried earlier in the day.  Glad that I finally got to try this excellent beerwould love to try it on draft some day.  (1685, 700)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Mouthfeel is moderate but it has way too much carbonation that makes me burpy and takes away from the experience.  Taste is mainly of tropical fruit, dirt (um, I mean earthy) straw, some metallic taste, light pine and lemon.  Plenty of bitter grapefruit rind as well.

287,"2012-02-23",4.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/6/2010.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 

Dreadnaught pours an amber tangerine color with a strong 4 cm white head. Great retention, especially for a DIPA, and sticky lace all over the glass.

There are some sweet caramel malt notes in the aroma, but this a hop-centric beer. Pleasant aroma of tangerine, mango, grapefruit, and apricot hops. 

Lightly sweet all the way through, even with the hop assault. A variety of citrus flavors - orange and grapefruit mostly, as well as peach and some floral notes. Very strong and robust flavor. I love it. The alcohol is completely hidden. How, I have no idea. Mildly bitter aftertaste. 

How is Dreadnaught this creamy? It is so smooth, so so creamy. Lightly carbonated, but it suits the flavor quite well. The strong hops leave my tongue tingling with a slightly oily residue. Fairly subdued, given the flavor.

Just keep it coming. I have a weak spot for DIPAs, and this is one of the best I have had. With a great taste and incredible smoothness, this is a very drinkable brew. The alcohol is not even noticeable, except for the pleasant warming of the stomach. Delicious. I drank this solo, but it would be a great pairing for some spicy food.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Ive seen this beer come out cloudy on some pours and clear on some pours... Ive even seen it pour cloudy and then clear up??? I assume its from where the keg/bottle has been filled from the holding vessel. Regardless of haziness, the beer has a beautiful orange meets graveyard western sky color, nice white head, not too big. I love to look at the clear pour of this beer as it can be as smooth as glass. The only reason I didnt give it a perfect score is because the look of the beer is inconsistent.

Huge citrus and pine scent up front. Its as if Mr. Coniferous and Ms. Tangerine ran into each other and suddenly melted on under the hot Chicago sun (in July/August). Lying underneath them would be high quality 2-row malt that is scooping them up. Next to Hopslam this is one of my favorite smelling beers.

Over and over again this beer collapses my palate with piney and citrusy hops. It never gets old. The light body makes this beer super drinkable Love it! Amazingly I never taste the bite of alcohol. Maybe its just me???

From the 11/2011 3R6P tasting. +++ Sampled from a 22 oz brown bottle this beer poured a slightly hazy apricot color with a medium sized white head that faded quickly and left a touch of lacing. The aroma was sweet pine, pineapple and orange. The flavor was sweet, tart and a bit our with fairly strong pineapple and pine and light orange and lemon. There were undertones of caramel and floral hops. The finish was medium length tangy mixed hops. Fairly full bodied. Quite nice but no all of what I had hoped.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
287,"2011-11-05",4.3,"Serving: Bottle from Labonix.  Thanks Zach!  It pours a slightly hazy, light gold with a nice white head.  The nose is powerfully hoppy with some pine and tropical fruit notes.  The flavor is very well balanced with notes of pine, light resin, some peach, and starfruit from the hop side.  The malt gives some light caramel and a smooth mouthfeel.  Medium bodied with average carbonation and a lingering bitter finish.  This brew is beautifully balanced.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"
287,"2011-10-30",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2013 Aroma is big piney resiny hops, faint malt.

287,"2011-10-29",4.2,"I received a bomber of this in a trade.  It was poured into a footed tulip glass.  This double IPA pours a very beautiful amber-reddish color with a strong, 1 & 1/2 finger head that leaves very sturdy lacing down the glass.  The aroma is a fruit bomb with pineapple, grapefruit, mango and pear.  You can smell a sweet malt as well in the nose, mixing with the fruit.  On the palate, the beer is smooth with a pleasing carbonation that carries flavors of tropical fruit, pungent hops and a caramel-like malt backbone.  It finishes somewhat sweet.  This was an intensely fruity and very enjoyable double IPA that I found to be just a touch on the sweet side for me.  I wasnt too surprised by the sweetness because it seems to me that a lot of their beers are on the sweeter side.  Nonetheless, a very smooth and tasty example of the style.","Pennsylvania, USA","bosendorfer"

287,"2011-10-24",3.1,"Bottle from Marshall during Jeffs bachelor party.  Hazy,almost opaque light gold with a thin thight head that left a ton of lace down the glass.  Aroma of a flower garden, some anise, mangos, wheat, lemon rind, and pine grease.  Taste was an explosion of pine resin, with floral herbs rushing in, anise, some warm booziness, other tropical fruity hops, with an interesting, albiet subtle, caramalt backbone.  A little overtly boozy with a bit too much alpha acidity.  Everyone else adored it.  I felt ambivalent.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
287,"2011-10-22",4.3,"Bottled. Pale amber colour, creamy and lacy head. Aroma: full of hops! Starts piney when chilled, has more citrus fruits, mango and floral nectars when warmer. Light caramelly touch on the nose. Very nice malt body, not sugary or cloying. Not particularly bitter, but it has very nice, wide hop flavor. Very smoot, velvety texture. Lovely beer with amazing drinkability.","Oulu, FINLAND","esox"
287,"2011-10-20",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2013 This beer is ridiculous...ly good.  Pours a golden color with white head and lacing that will not go away.  Aroma of grassy hops.

287,"2011-10-16",4.5,"Bottle @ Mikkeller Bar on October 15. Pours hazy golden with a thick white head that leaves lots of trace on the glass as it dissipates. Smell is sweet wth some bread, tropical fruits like peaches, apricots, papaya and passionfruit. Theres also slight notes of vanilla and a clear tingling smell of alcohol. Taste is incredibly smooth and well balanced with resin, pine, orange zest, mango, kiwifruit, vanilla taffy, freshly cut wood and some honey. Finish is smooth and bitter with some grapefruit. A really good beer thats incredibly balanced. Could drink this all day every day!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
287,"2011-10-16",4.4,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Appearance is a nice translucent orange with a sticky white head of foam that leaves perfect lacing as you work your way through the glass. Drinking this beer doesnt really constitute working, though. Aroma is filled with hops. I get oranges, grapefruit rind, resin, and flowers. The taste accumulates all of the accents of the aroma, but portrays them in a fantastic way. The fruity note of the aroma turn into a peach and mango collision while the grapefruit rind moves more to the end of drink in a smooth transition. The resin detected in the aroma disappears from the taste. Mouthfeel is sticky with the medium to full body. Soft carbonation. Finish is long and juicy. Definitely a beer to pick up if the opportunity presents itself.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
287,"2011-10-15",4.0,"I brought this one to our IPA day party.
A - Pours slightly hazed golden yellow with a nice pillow of one finger tall white head leaving small beads of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of a mix of grassy and citric hops, tropical fruits; mostly grapefruit and pineapple; and some light sweetness from the lightly toasted caramel malt.
T - Starts off with a nice dose of grassy hops quickly giving way to a mix of even more citric hops, pineapple, grapefruit, and the ever present caramel malt. I am glad I drank this one when I did as it seems like the sweetness is growing quickly, swallowing up the juicy hops. The finish is a mix of hop bitterness and caramel sweetness, lingering for a short period of time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slick, hoppy, feel with plenty of it lingering through the finish.
O - When fresh, this one is hard to beat. It is very well balanced and has plenty of hops for even the most fervent hop head. I hope to try this one on-tap someday and really give it a proper going over.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

287,"2011-10-04",4.1,"22 oz bomber from a trade (thanks Mike). Feeling like some hops - and this did the trick. Poured into my Three Floyds snifter (too small).

287,"2011-10-01",4.9,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip.  Great deep amber color with a white head.  Aroma is a wallop of citrusy hops, with a hint of pine.  Taste is similarly awesome, lots of citrusy hops, particularly grapefruit, with a hint of pine and nice malt support that doesnt steal the show from those wonderful hops.  Goes down nice and smooth for a brew this hoppy, decent body but not too big, perfect mouthfeel.

This beer pours a nice bright orange, with a fizzy white head that fades quickly and leaves a slight lacing. It is a nice floral fruity beer that is smooth balanced and easy to drink.

287,"2011-09-01",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2014 The nose on this thing is as close to utter perfection as Ive ever experienced. The description on the bottle does not do it justice. The hops are nothing short of perfect, and the strong malts make for a perfect complement, resulting in a spectacular, harmonious orchestra of tropical fruits (mango, peach, pineapple), citrus, flowers, and pine. The taste follows these notes, making for a bitter and, to a lesser degree, sweet impression on the tongue. You might think this is a really strong and overpowering drink, what with the 9.5% abv and the 100 IBUs, but this really drinks like orange juiceif you can withstand the sourness of the citrus in your stomach, you can drink until you pass the f*ck out. The only thing that, in my opinion, keeps this beer from true glory is the thin palate. I was expecting a much thicker feel, especially since it LOOKS thick. Carbonation is on the weaker side, but I attribute this to shipping and handling. I did expect a little more viscosity, though.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"
287,"2011-08-29",3.6,"On tap at GTMW - Pours amber with a small white head. Huge citrus nose with tropical fruitiness and a sweet malt base. Well-balanced.

287,"2011-07-31",4.2,"Where to start...the most impressive part of this beer for me was the hop wallop at the beginning, which lit up the tip of my tongue and subsided just enough to allow the malt sweetness to make an appearance. I did get some of the mango and peach on the aroma, but improper glassware probably inhibited this part of the experience for me. Of the 3 Three Floyds DIPAs Ive now tried (Apocalypse Cow, Arctic Panzer Wolf), I would say this is the most balanced. Very enjoyable.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"

Original Rate: I wasnt overly impressed with this.  Hopefully it was just a bad bottle.  Amber color, really sugary fruity aroma.  My pour had almost not head whatsoever.  Syrupy in the mouth.

my first Dreadnaught.  All I can say is Wow!  This lives up to the hype.   Ive never tried another IPA/IIPA/double IPA that has an aroma of pine.  (Although grapefruit is in the aroma, too).  Theres a considerable white head that lasted a couple minutes after I poured it into a glass, above a somewhat cloudy orange color.  The taste is ""a hopheads dream beer"" as promised, but with lots of citrus surprises.  Much more satisfying than the same brewerys Arctic Panzer Wolf (which was good, but not fantastic like this).

Nice pine and fruit mix on the hop profile from the nose.  Pine hops assault the roof of my mouth on the first sip, and then sweet fruits kick in from mid to late palate, rolling down my tongue and throat.  Malt presence is a sweet backdrop to this play, and make the whole composition work.  Falls short of Piny on a number of levels, but has to be in the top few DIPAs Ive had.

Pours lightly hazy burnt gold with a three finger foamy white head that leaves a couple of rings of foamy lace and holds a small cap.

Aroma is peaches, grapefruit citrus, some pineapple and mango along with good grassy and herbal notes.  Some mild malt peeks through but the hops are the star here.  Good to very good strength.

Flavor is tropical fruits of pineapple and mango, some lemon and grapefruit citrus rind, peach and apricot, giving way to some caramel and bready malt that offers a touch of sweetness which is then swept away by a wave of hop bitterness.  Some alcohol is noted but isnt solvent or biting.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and slick, low-medium carbonation.

A superb DIPA, very tasty and a huge want for a long time.  Thrilled to have the chance to finally try this.

287,"2011-05-20",4.2,"It pours a light amber/straw color. Which for an Imperial IPA seems a bit too pale. No matter, I dont taste the color of beer. Big, frothy white head up top. The lacing is typical of most IIPAs in that it is there, and it dries up quickly. Which also means that it stay around for the entire drinking session. I am immediately hit with a huge hop aroma. I thought I had left a bag of hops out. It is that pungent. That is really all there is to smell. The hops definitely dominate the aroma in this beer. Which is not bad. I have smelled bad before, and this is nowhere close to it. There is the typical grapefruit citrus aroma. A little grassy. And a lot awesome. I also get a slight crystal malt aroma. The kind that is almost caramel, but just not quite, and definitely smells a bit like sugar.

The initial taste is very similar to the nose on this one. Big grapefruit citrus flavor. A bit of a floral, grassy taste on the back side. A very subdued malt flavor. The hops really are the main player in this beer. I wont say it is unbalanced, but the hops definitely outweigh the malt. A bitterness and a slight warming from the alcohol. There is a slight dryness to it, which would explain the lack of  any malt sweetness. A very bitter bite stays with me well after I swallow each sip I take. Well, its not really a sip. More like a gulp. Very floral flavor left over too, but it reminds me more of the aroma than actually tasting like flowers. Very quaff-able beer.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

Poured from a bottle into a Stone IPA tulip glass. Jesus I can smell it already and it is several feet from my face. Beer is orangish / yellow carbonation moderate, hazy (like most DIPA) and forms a thin head of small to medium bubbles. Lacing is high.

Smells like a lot of malt, strong citrus hop aroma. This has an aggressive aroma. Really sweet smelling, no alcohol in the aroma though.

Full bodied, hops are not the first thing that I taste. There is a nice sweetness and great hop flavors in the midpalate, the back end is not as bitter as I thought. Second taste, bitterness is growing but still not as strong as I expected / wanted. I wish there was a date on the bottle but alas, I cannot find one. Overall a decent and drinable DIPA.

Smell is intense, when I first popped the cap off this one it was a tropical fruit surprise. In the glass it is very hoppy and sweet smelling. Has a decidedly citrus hop scent, not too spicy. There is a hint of pine needles. Hop mania through and through.

Mmmm a refreshing hop bomb. The hops attack your palate furiously and do not relent. Citrus hops come in a barrage, then a slight bit of sweet biscuity malt hits, finishing with joyful hop bitterness. Yep, the malt is there, in the middle, but this is a hop lovers dream. Mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly carbonated.

There is no problem in finishing this 22 ouncer, could have gone for a 750 of this or heck even a liter, the alcohol is definitely noticeable and a bit warming but doesnt really show it self too much too be off-putting enough for one not to easily down one of these quickly.

Very little alcohol on this one, but youll feel it. On tap, its creamy and sticky. Not your average (double) IPA. Medium-low carbonation. This one will sneak up on you.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"
287,"2010-12-27",4.5,"From notes:

Pours a dark ruby/golden orange color with burnt orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger frothy, pillowy white foam head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that lingers throughout the entire glass and coats the pint with large chunks of soapy lacing.

Dank, resinous hop aroma with lots of earthy pine and citrus fruit notes. Hints if grapefruit, pineapple and lemon peel as well as pine needle and sunlte malt presence that takes away from the hops slightly.

Chewy full body with lots of uber fresh dank, oily hop flavor. Plenty of sweet citrus fruit notes as well as earthy bitter pine flavorthat the aroma suggested. Hints of grapefruit, pineapple, mango and lemon peel. The malt backbone is present and provides nice balance but isnt as prominent as the aroma suggests. There is a sligt lactic/creamy quality mid-palate that makes this beer extremely quaffable. The perfect balance of bitter, floral, sweet and slight malt. The ABV is excellently masked and there is a bitter dry finish. One of the best IPAs Ive ever had.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
287,"2010-12-24",4.2,"A: poured into a snifter. Color is a cloudy amber that is more orange than red. nice slightly off white head that has a low retention rate and leads to faint lacing.

S: strong rich oaky aroma that reminds me of an oak aged stout. Strong hops aroma that is mostly citrus and pine, with pine being the lead. some small amounts of vanilla, coconut and some cherries.

T: amazing flavor! nice toasted and caramel malts supply a great backdrop for this beer. Wonderful citrus flavors from the hops, more of a sweet orange flavor. Some mild pine flavors. no strong alcohol flavors either.

M: amazingly smooth for almost 10%. medium to full bodied. low to medium carbonation.

This suggested citrus bitterness in the flavor, but the malt profile more than met the hoppy challenge, shining through with notes of buttered biscuits and pale honey.

287,"2010-11-02",4.0,"Split a 22oz bomber with a friend (sent to me from ""Fanbrew"" in Indiana)Appearance: Pure orange. Mostly clear with a slight hop haze. Little, yellow, frothy head. Great lacing, though. Not very bubbly (surprisingly).Aroma: more like tropical fruit juice than beer. The bottle is right on - mango, peach and citrus notes with some flowery, perfume-like scent. Very enticing.Taste: Just like the nose its tropical fruit and citrus with a bold, bitter finish. Hops pack a punch here making for a wicked robust palate. Bitterness takes some getting used to, though.Mouthfeel: For such a strong beer its a little thinner that Id expect. Thankfully it doesnt tear up my tongue while its in my mouth (the hops do that afterwards, though).Drinkability: Starts off quite juice-like and refreshing, but becomes drier and bitterer with each sip. Thankfully the 9.5% ABV is well used as there is no heat or warmth to the beer and it goes down smooth. Still, this beer might be a little too bitter for its own good.Overall: Reminds me of Bells Hopslam sans honey. I really love the juicy taste but the bitterness is hard to handle on its own.

Aroma: the description of mango and peach in the nose is dead on, definitely with that piney, Centennial hop smell.  Somewhat weird, but I got a touch ripe berry hints as well.  There is a firm, but manageable nutty/carmel aroma too.

appearance: deep copper, hop haze, and a thin, but beautifully lacey, white head.

taste:  no roughness in the hop flavor, like a thin velvet hotel blanket of hops getting pulled over your palate.  The carbonation and very danky blend of hops slowly fizzle out with the carbonation with a rich malty comforter.  Reminiscent of many DIPAs, but with a fruitier hop blend.  Im assuming some clean bittering hops, and some big mid boil additions of centennials, otherwise im not getting much late addition hop flavors, but i know that can age out quickly.

Pours a clear golden/amber with a nice 1 to 2 finger white head.  Aroma bursting of piney and citrus fruit hop.  Taste is great.  9.5% is well hidden behind the rich fruit hop bitterness, orange peel, and sweet caramel.  Just an overall good-for-any occasion beer.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","SpencerDB"

Medium body, not nearly the smack in the face that I expected.  Very well balanced, the hops come through nicely in the flavor but not overpowering thanks to the malt.  The finish is where you really notice a sharp hoppy bite.  As the bitterness fades, youre left with a nice orange note on your tongue.  Damn good beer.","New Hope, Minnesota, USA","13mikey"
287,"2010-07-26",4.2,"Bottle reviewed from notes.  Ill rate the fresher bottle I had of this because it was a more accurate example of what the brewer intended here.  Pours a clear amber with a big head.  Pine trees and forest in the aroma, awesome use of hops.  Intense bitter and sweet flavors, really citrus like in the mouth.  Nice balance with the malt and hops.  Drank fresh this is one of the best IPAs Ive had.  Just an explosion of hops, tropical fruits, and strikes an awesome balance.","Binghamton, New York, USA","CapnJazz"

287,"2010-07-18",3.6,"Amber in color with white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Grapefruit, pineapple and some pine in the nose. A moderate and fairly overt alcohol burn in the mid and finish taste. The citrus in the nose does not translate well to the mouth. Overall, good flavor, but as a personal preference I would prefer a more subtle alcohol presence and more citrus in the mouth. Less balanced to me than Pliny or Yulesmith which I thought were excellent. I lean toward the West coast style IPA flavor profile.","USA","borborygmi"

Theres clearly a bit of malt in here, but it does a good job of staying in the background; the sweetness is quite subtle and not overwhelming.  Not particularly syrupy for a beer with so many hops in it, which I appreciate.  Dry finish, but not overkill.  Probably the best IIPA Ive had from a brewery east of the Mississippi, but I still prefer some of the West Coast IIPAs (Pliney and the Green Flash IIPA, in particular).","Connecticut, USA","sepia5"

287,"2010-06-18",4.1,"650 mL bottle from the brewery, served in an English pint glass. Pours a clear straw colour with a dense, white head. Head has good retention and leaves amazing lace. Aroma is primarily big American hops--pine and grapefruit--with light roasted malts, peach and a touch of tropical fruit. The flavour begins medium bitter with a slight caramel sweetness. It becomes increasingly bitter towards the finish, which is lingering malt. On the palate, light-medium in body with a smooth, slightly astringent, texture. Overall, an excellent IIPA. Its 9.5% ABV is very well concealed. Generously hopped and intensely bitter, but without being overwhelming. No sledgehammer-over-the-head bitter here.

Aroma is sweet, citrus, grapefruit, and peach are definitely perceptible.  Hints of the caramel notes are present as well.  Incredibly smooth, thinner mouthfeel, carbonation on the low side, nice and sweet up front.  The bitter takes a while to hit you and really creeps up on you after youve swallowed, and it lingers for a while.  Good amount of malt to stand up to the hops, but while the malt quantity seems fairly sufficient, its not very complex.

287,"2010-06-13",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2011 Sasquatch just booked his flight to Munster Indiana.  Hes heard the rumors of amber colored brew with an amazing balance of piney hops and malt.  Three Floyds came thorough for our Northwest brethren with this Imperial IPA masterpiece.  The nose is duped by the overwhelming aroma of hops.  The palate also never identifies the high alcohol content of this bad boy.  This is due to the fact that the initial blast of pine, citrus, and hops is quickly counteracted by a rush of malt.

S- Smell is a big and balanced combination of piny and citrus hops. The piny hops dominate the nose at the end.

T- Upfront is lots of citrus hops and a good dose of piny hops. A whole lot of hop flavor upfront. The finish is a smack in the face of refreshing piny hops with hints of fruity citrus subtly making a presence in the background. What lingers is a big piny hop flavor. The bitterness is definitely present but not strong until a second or third swallow is made after a gulp of this brew. The hop flavor is definitely the main character here.

P- Medium carbonation and big thick oily mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy.

O- This is a pretty darn good DIPA. One that is hard to find and it was definitely a treat for me. The 9.5% ABV is well hidden but takes its effect pretty fast.

However, here is where I disagree with the majority of raters - Im not quite sure what all the hype on this beer is - sure, its a nice beer but it is not really that great.  Certainly I finished the bottle and will finish what I purchased, but this is just a normal, run of the mill, DIPA.  Not over the top or great, not bad.  Well, made, pours nice, smells nice, tastes nice.  This is not, however, a ""Pliny the Elder,"" ""Alesmith IPA,"" ""Alpine Nelson"" or any other of the top rated beers.  Perhaps I got a bad bottle?

The beer pours a deep gold with little head but lots of lacing. The smell is thick with clementines, limes and floral hops. The flavor is similarly great. The hop flavor is very strong nearly to the point of having a solvent character. The malt is still quite sweet adding an excellent caramel character.

Ive never smelled a beer so accurately described. Nice active carbonation. Cloudy, which I had not remembered. Citrus aroma as well. Just a gorgeous smell. Ever so slight textile scent, some pine. Oddly, as was true at pub, I find the flavors slightly muddled at first. Lemony-er than other IIPAS. Malt a bit more roasty than I prefer. I enjoy the flavor more as it warms. Woody, complex. Honey, even peanut butter. Soooo citrusy. And me still with 2/3 of the bottle remaining. This has already been a journey. Butterscotch. Over the course of drinking this beer I went from not being that enamored of it to thinking maybe its the best beer Ive had. But the circumstances affect it too.

287,"2009-07-09",4.3,"22 oz. (older label?) originally reviewed 3/1/2009. Into a Mason jar. 

Pours a copper-honey, quintessential IPA color with a smidge of haze. Small wisps of carbonation rise to the faint remains of a slightly buttery-eggshell-colored 1/2 finger head. Slight lemon hue shines through the translucence of this deal.

Almost perfect balance of abundant floral hoppiness and a mild yet prevalent caramel malt backbone. Sweetness exudes a faint alcohol burn. Citrus hops emerge with the warmth.

This is less of a hop bomb than I expected and thats by no means a bad thing...everyone needs a little balance in abundance once in a while. Sure, there are a lot of floral, mildly citrus and a bit grassy hops in here with a little twang of grapefruit rind but the malt keeps this more old-school. It provides a viscous husky backbone with a slight butterscotch/caramel sweetness...and a mild...very mild...alcohol burn.

I got no beef with the palate on this - theres perfect balance between silky hop oils and the natural caramel malt texture. Finish is long, clean...a little viscous and alcoholic...and velvety. ""Im needy...Im inadequate...I got it all, baby!""

The only reason I havent powered this down is because Im too busy writing of its many virtues. Carbonation gives this enhancement to the citrus notes and extra brightness. A little more classic English notion than todays hop bombs but to say the least, this is well-crafted and quite enjoyable.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

The flavor has tons of juicy hops that burst with grapefruit and tangerine.   There is a big malt body that is on the sweet side, but a massive bitterness perfectly balances it.   Full bodied with creamy carbonation.   Malty, but in a way that enhances the hops instead of takes away from them.   I was worried that I might not get a fresh bottle, but this seems pretty spot on as to what I was expecting.   Maybe not the freshest, but hardly worse for wear.

The appearance is true to the IIPA style, orange, relatively clear, thin white head.  The flavor is excellent as well.  Like the aroma in the sense that there is a strong fruitiness, citrus, caramel, the hoppiness almost takes a backseat.  This is a little surprising.   The citrus hops (the one type of hops I pick up here) definitely linger nicely on the palate.  Like the sensation of eating a grapefruit.  Medium thick mouthfeel, a little slick, light carbonation.  I expected a thicker feel, to be honest.  This is one beer that will always have a hard time living up to its rep, but is definitely an excellently crafted beer.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"

Poured it out and the golden orange color filled the glass with a nice white head.  Once the aroma had a chance to breathe it was like a pine forest in my kitchen hop heaven.  The taste is great nice and citrusy with of course a hop bit its perfectly balanced with so malt and not too crazy bitter.  Great beer!!!!!!!","Fergus Falls, Minnesota, USA","bobbypaulson"
287,"2009-06-05",3.9,"Had this years ago and it was fresh and I was completely floored.  Have had numerous times since and never rated because I never had a fresh one.  Well, this is close as I might get.  Pours orange with white head.  Aroma of piney hops.  Taste is citrus hops and nice balance of malt.  Hops not as overwhelming as I remember.  Medium mouthfeel.  Easy drinking.  Good but not great.","Alabama, USA","jsh12bama"
287,"2009-06-03",3.6,"Oh the expectations!  Clear dark gold, tall white head rose above the glass and threatened to spill over for a second.  Big sticky hops, pineapple, orange and grapefruit.  Reminds me of the first Hop-15 I had.  Actually kind of salty up front.  The hops seem to have fallen off though I was told it was a fresh bottle.  So balanced the strong and intense flavors cancel.  Theres caramel malt and sticky resiny hops, but I want these beers to come through in waves and these flavors end up flat.  Im not saying its not a good beer, but I was expecting fireworks.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"

Aroma is pretty simple but nice citrus and pine,  dominated bu hops.  Flavor is far more complex with various different fruits like grapefruit, orange, pears, and fresh tart berries.  A decent caramel backbone supports it.  Very well balanced, does not blast the senses with bitterness as expected.

Aroma is intense: Pine hops, citrus hops;  grapefruit, lemon and orange.  A bit of a malt back bone too.  flavor is huge hoppy goodness.  A bit of pepper, a lot of grapefruit and pinehop.  Very crisp finish: just the right notes linger.  The old (06)> Aroma is more like a barleywine.  Roasted malt, caramel, with a nice hop backbone.  Flavor is syrupy sweetness with a distant hop flavor that comes through mostly in the finish; prevents it from being cloying.  it tastes like two different beers.  Both have their own good characteristics.  The New is an IIPA, the old is a barleywine with a hop backbone, both are tasty as far as Im concerned.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
287,"2009-05-16",4.2,"Golden yellow pour with a white head. Aroma of fruity hops hits you as soon as you open the bottle., during the pour, and as it sits before you. Very smooth tasting, hoppy, but not overbearing. Some spicyness, alittle dryness in the aftertaste, makes you want to take another drink. Nice lacing on the glass. I should of bought more at DLD, but it is only a 90 minute drive away. One of the best DIPAs Ive had so far.","Granville, Illinois, USA","GranvilleTim"
287,"2009-05-14",3.7,"Appearance  Pours a light yellow color and turns into a dark amber caramel color. When held up to the light it becomes very light and slightly couldy. Very little head, hardly any lacing, only a small ring remains. After swirling the glass a 1 finger head emerges; the kind of head (not to mention it lasts a good while too, whew) that just redeemed this beers appearance quite a bit!

Smell  This has a very floral hop aroma, that is very, very strong. This actually smells a lot like the new batch of Hop Henge. Has some citrusy mango notes as well, but they are blanketed a great deal by the strong hop presence. This should be quite the hop bomb!

Taste  The hops take a second to hit you, but they creep up on you and build slowly. This lacks the hop zing that I love in DIPAs, which is unfortunate. The hops are dominate in the taste just like in the smell, but the caramel backbone shows its face in the finish and lends this beer a little bit of smokiness that was unexpected.

Mouthfeel  The lack of hop zing hurts this beers mouthfeel, but it has a nice thick resiny feel to it. This kind of DIPA sticks around to let you taste it for quite some time after you are done drinking it. Nothing overwhelming though.

Drinkability  I will easily be able to finish the rest of this bomber, but I cant help but want to just pour the rest and open up a Two Hearted. This beer is just an underwhelming beer for me.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"
287,"2009-05-13",4.9,"22 oz courtesy of Adrian. Smells of hops, pine, mango, peaches and citrusy grapefruit. Amazing aroma! Pours a goregous golden orange colour with a medium sized white head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Tastes of pine, hops, malt and fruit.

Very pleasant aroma of bright, fruity orange and grapefruit along with some caramel.

Full bodied.  Very enjoyable.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

Mid-palate rounds with caramel and malt sweetness while maintaining fruit profile.  Finish gains in spiciness again almost like a rye-IPA, with some soap and alcohol to boot.  Aftertaste is warming.

287,"2009-03-27",4.2,"22 oz bottle. Ah, the final beer in my rating beer quest, and possibly my favorite of them all. Pours a hazy golden color with almost no head (white and dies quickly). Smells of so many things: hops (tons of them), malt, lots of mango, and some citrus. The only thing Ive had so far that rivals this in smell is Bells Hopslam, though its close. Tastes of mango, some citrus, lighter hops than I was expecting, and a malt aftertaste. Goes down quite smoothly (as long as you can stand I-IPAs). Really a very good beer, one of my favorites, and it would be a regular if it werent so difficult to find combined with the price. Makes me want to try this Russian River that is supposedly better than Dreadnaught.","Highland Park, Illinois, USA","soccer290"
287,"2009-03-25",4.2,"Bottle. A lightly hazy medium amber beer with a medium sized, quite lasting and lacing white head. The aroma has a quite good maltiness and a immense hoppiness with notes of grapefruit, oranges, tropical fruit, caramel and alcohol. The flavour is highly sweet with more malt presence than other beers in this style and very fruity, sugary, and finally balanced, enough complex and very light stickiness. Medium to full body, lively carbonation, quite long finish with medium bitterness and not much more, so less than in a normal IIPA.

287,"2009-03-20",4.3,"Pours a orange, golden color and is topped with a thick off white head with quite a bit of staying power.  Aroma is a nice mixture of orange citrus with a bit more of mango and then some pretty bitter floral and spruce notes mixed in.  Flavor starts off somewhat sweet with some citrus flavors in there as well but the overall floral and spruce bitterness carries through the hole tasting and takes hold as the main contributor to the flavor on the last half of the tasting along with the light caramel malt flavors.  Body of the beer is nice and holds the flavors perfectly while all the while masking the alcohol presence very well.  Overall this beer presents a sound aromatic and a highly flavorful beer well worth a try, albeit a bit pricey.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

The flavor is just as great, with a nice balance and a touch of vanilla. Chewy palate with soft carbonation. Awesome. The king of hop bombs.

287,"2009-03-16",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2009 Bottle compliments of TearsForBeers.
Pours a hazy orange color with a sold white head and a gorgeous lace. The aroma is strong and piney at first followed by orange and sweet melon with some mild floral notes. The flavor is wonderfully complex, very bitter and hoppy. Instantly fruity with notes of melon and mango with some good citrus and pine notes. This is wildly balanced with a big malty sweetness that in no way detracts from the big hop flavor but seems to work as a backdrop really allowing the hops to showcase their flavor all the while providing a pleasant balance for their bitterness. The mouth feel is big with a nice sharpness mid palate. Try this beer by any means necessary.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
287,"2009-03-15",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2010 Re-rate 3/3/10.  Thanks brewblackhole!  Peach, mango, plenty of tropical fruit, as well as pine hops and caramel malt.  Sweet but not sticky.  Bitter but not as bitter as the first time I had this with nice drinkability and overall better this time.  Very little alcohol sting and everything meshes nearly perfectly.  I fully expected to confirm my original rating that this is a great IIPA but probably not top 5 but I cant say that.  Right there with PtE.  Original rating:   Bomber from Archer Liquors. Finally, I get to try the highly-rated Dreadnaught.  This pours an orange-amber color with a thin off-white head. Just a little head retention and not much lacing to speak of. The aroma is strong citrusy grapefruit hops along with some alcohol fumes. Big, thick malty backbone here to support the massive onslaught of hops; grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, big hop variety, and a long-lasting bitter dry finish. There is a bit of an alcohol sting in the flavor. This is a terrific beer, no doubt about that, but it wasnt a mind-blowing experience and theres still probably several IIPAs Id put ahead of this, if for no other reason due to drinkability. This seemed just a little sticky at times.  So glad to finally try this and Im sure Ill be re-visiting again down the road. Would love to do a taste test some day with other top notch IIPAs.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Overall - Has better mouthfeel than Hopslam with great finish! I still prefer Ruination due to the fact that its more balanced. The second best IIPA in my book!!...so far","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","SHANER4"

Aroma is citrusy hops and sweet caramel malt.  Really enticing. Strong hops deliver a backhanded pimp-slap off the bat that hits you like a Mack Truck in the ass.  Malty sweetness is right there with it to balance.  Flavor is top-notch and finish is smooth with hop oils coating your tongue.

Lots of sweet/sticky resinous hop leaf in the aroma with light catty suggestions, honey, light mango and a touch of vegetal. Slick warming body. Big bodied, with a lot of honey and crystal malt sweetness. Underneath is some vegetal and resiny hops with a touch of lychee. I expected more, as its just very sweet with no subtlety.

A great easy drinking IIPA that does not overpower you.  Pretty simple to drink the entire bomber without much notice.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
287,"2009-01-24",4.5,"Color was a nice cloudy orange, aroma was hoppy citrusy, and slightly sweet. Unfortunately I tried this beer a little too cold, and at first it didnt seem much like a double ipa to me. When, cold, the hops dominate, with citrus up front, subsiding to a piney dry aftertaste. Still, it is remarkably well balanced, and smooth. Again, it did not seem much like a double ipa, because it was lacking a strong malt sweetness to it. Then I let it warm up. This beer probably had the biggest change of any Ive had when it came to temperature. After it had warmed, the hops seemed to intermingle with a nice warm sweetness from the malts. It became more balanced. The flavor became much sweeter and a mango-hop flavor appeared. Overall: a nicely balanced iipa, with wonderfull complexity that appears as it warms.","Norman, Oklahoma, USA","milljam"
287,"2009-01-23",4.0,"Aroma:  Clean, balanced hop aroma with some alcoholic aroma.  The aroma was strong full when I initially open poured my beer, but it quickly dissipated.
 
Appearance:  Golden amber with orange glow.  Nice off white head with some lacing on the glass
 
Flavor:  Pleasant hop bitterness with mild maltiness.  The maltiness was there, but it did not offset or balance the hoppyness.
 
Mouth feel:  Medium-light body, mild carbonations
 
Overall Impression:  I would like to have a more balanced approach with malt flavor, have the alcohol aroma decreased and a stronger hop present in the aroma.  As I approach the end on the bomber it becomes more drinkable.  I would not want to drink more than one bomber in sitting.","Kansas, USA","mrbirmingham"

Aroma:  More malt than expected, less citrus; milky, nutty cookie from malt; orange, pine, and spruce from hops;  seems like two independent components rather than unified;  also possibly honey and butter.

Flavor:  A tale of two flavors!  Initially, almost all malt, with moderate bitterness; finish is almost all bitter hops, malt almost completely disappears; would rather see good balance throughout than two separate temporal components","Crestwood, Illinois, USA","mnovacanes"
287,"2009-01-21",4.4,"Thanks to Bobby91w for including this in a very generous trade! This brew has an incredible amount of flavor. Pours an orangeish honey color, with very little head - you can easily tell how thick it is during the pour. Tons of hops, but an even stronger contingent of malts on the nose. It smells sweet - I can certainly see where theyre coming from with mango and peach, although theres more sweet grain, like a corn-based breakfast cereal. The flavor explodes when it hits your tongue - a lash of bitter hops (and plenty of them) is held in check by the sweeter, earthier flavors. Stays clean enough with the alcohol presence (covered well) and a crisp finish, though I wish it had just a bit more carbonation - its a bit sticky. This really is more along the lines of a barley wine, but it is utterly delicious.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

287,"2009-01-07",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2010 7/10/10- New bottle.  Having the new one against a dreadnaught aged approximately 27 months in the basement.  Both pour that brilliant amber color, but the older version is far hazier.  The older one is far sweeter and maltier, with giant syrupy candied orange notes, while the newer one exhibits oily, resinous, and pithy citrus notes that are far sharper and less rounded.  Flavor follows the same pattern, with beautiful sharp hop notes in the new one, including lemon, orange, and herbal notes.  The older one is syrupy and sweet, like a well done barleywine.  Almost no alcohol presence in the aged version, while the fresh dreadnaught has a beautiful pungency to it.  I suggest anybody try a fresh one against an aged one if they get the opportunity.

1/7/09-  Bottle aged for about 9 months.  Pours a brilliant orange-red with foamy off-white head, which dissipates after a couple minutes.  Gorgeous fruity nose with notes of peach, mango, pineapple, orange, and lemon, balanced out with earthy, and biscuity malts and a caramel backbone.  The bitterness has been subdued by the aging, but resiny citrus oils still linger throughout.  Really nice biscuit, and caramel malt notes, combined with some delicate earthy-tea flavors that seem to show up in most of the 3F offerings I have tasted.  Piney at the finish.

Pours a hazy dark orange-amber with a thin, fine, light tan head.  The beer even looks malty (not my favorite characteristic in double IPAs).  On to the aroma, which is dense with dark, caramelized citrus peel (grapefruit, lemon) hops characteristics.  This is followed by spice, then resin, which is combined with syrupy malt and alcohol.  Smells huge.  The flavor is thick and dark with ""cooked"" citrus hops flavors and ultra-dense bitterness that are intensified by lots of malt sweetness and some alcohol presence.  The flavor is not grainy or dry (things I usually like in double IPAs), but sweet and malty with a barrage of bitterness.  The body is just as thick and immense as everything else about this beer.  The alcohol is fairly well contained but theres no hiding it.  The bitterness and alcohol finishes long, warm, and raspy.  This is a well put-together beer of immense proportions.  It is skillfully made to be sure, but not in the same class as the finest double IPAs.  Rather than a finely crafted grain dimension and vibrant hops profile this beer is heavy and distinctly ""dark.""  A very enjoyable drinking experience that reminds me of a hugely hoppy American barleywine, and not necessarily the best double IPA in the world.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
287,"2008-10-13",4.0,"I was not initially a hop-head, but the more IPA and IIPAs I try and the more I learn about the various hops, their flavor profiles and their potential, the more enamored and under the influence of the ever so delicate and seductive hop I become. Not to be toyed with, Lady Hop can subtly lure you into her embrace, or just as likely, attack you from behind and hold you in her grip until you submit. A fantastical tease.

Dreadnaught poured a golden amber hue into my glass as a minor head of foam rose to meet the challenge, then humbly stepped down, leaving a lingering trail of brussels lace along the way. As she bowed out, an incredibly sweet, wet, oily piney nose took over. I even detected a hint of old socks. The prevalent nose though was one of sweet sap and oily freshly crushed pine. Anyone who has been in a forest of pine trees and smelled the dew in the air and the trampled wet pine needles below your feet will understand. But I digress. As I enjoy my first quaff, then another, her body is thick, sticky, viscous and sweet. A hint of peaches mingle along with the dominating pine. She coats my tongue with each quaff where I detect bitterness along the sides and very back of my tongue. like a kiss, she is there and then gone, barely lingering long enough for some idle chatter, choosing instead to be on her way so as to tempt you to further pursuit. As I finish my glass of Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA, I am reminded of a sweet and crisp finish as I gaze up at the towering pine trees above and all around me, inhaling and tasting their fresh natural bounty.

Overall, I am very impressed with the Dreadnaught Imperial IPA from Three Floyds Brewing. I can see why it has garnered overwhelming rave reviews. I fear then that I shall blaspheme by saying she is not my favorite IIPA, but she is definitely in my top 5. An easy win for any hop-head. Should I ever come across a bottle or two, I will gladly bring her home with me.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Sweet hoppy smell. Mostly pineapple(?) then pine and citrus. Absolutely great nose.

Taste is even better. Bitter and citrus hoppy but also extremely well balanced by malt especially for an IIPA. As it warms I get more tropical fruit tastes but especially pineapple.

287,"2008-09-06",4.3,"bottle!  i had been dying to try this for years, then i got a bottle and let it sit for a while.  very silly of me.  pours a brilliantly clear amber, with a medium head that doesnt want to seem to go down much below the glass top.  i could smell tons of citrusy hops as i poured it, so this should be good.  strong nose of caramel/brown sugar malt and pineapple, grapefruit, pine, and peachy hops.  im surprised at the strength of the malt here.  its reminiscent of the better hopped-to-high-hell barleywines ive had.  good stuff.  lots of brilliant hop notes in the taste, dominated by the citrus and pine, with the brown sugar malt less burnt and more subdued and taking on a bit of a bready note.  the hops are there in abundance, too, but they still seem to be a complement rather than the focus.  plenty of bitterness in the finish, but it never even comes close to harsh - just a mild tingle, and perfectly balanced for the style (and my taste).  medium-to-full of body, and a luscious, soft, smooth mouthfeel.  i feel this is a style ive overdone, and these sorts of beers havent been as enjoyable; dogfish head 90 minute is a beer i drink regularly and consider boring (if exceptionally tasty).  but this is different.  its every bit as good as the summer yulesmith, and better than pliny the elder (though i only had pliny cold in a bar).  i love how the malt dominates.  its very much like a barelywine, but has enough hops to make you remember where it came from.  this is the best beer ive had in a long time.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

Flavor starts moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and acidic and moderately bitter. Palate is medium, oily and slick, and has a soft carbonation.

It disappointed some (4.3, unbelievable, I know) because I was hoping it could challenge my favorite Bell’s Hopslam.  This had a great aroma of hops (pine, citrus) and also hints of malts and barley.  Appearance was a very nice dark hazy orange with an off white head that started nice but faded.

Smell is big, fragrant hops, mostly floral and pine resin, slight citrus tones, caramel and toast malts linger as does slight alcohol, very flavorful and delicious.

Taste is initially sweetened pine hops, transitions to thick chewy caramel and bready malts, tones of oranges and cotton candy, finishes bitter with a hint of alcohol warming.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and slick resiny texture, carbonation is ample but moderate.

The bartender poured it with  a one inch head and it left rich lacing rings.  Seemed to be at about 55 degrees.  Nose was amazing, with citrus hops and some ripe fruit, backed up by some tantalizing odors of pine and other things I honestly cannot identify.  Suffice it to say is smells heavenly.  Mouthfeel is really smooth and slick.  Flavor is a very well balanced mixture of malts and hops.  Finish is bitter but not overly so.  A truly amazing beer.  I brought home a bottle so I can share this with another beer lover.

This is an update from the bottle taken from the beer cellar and poured at 50 degrees F.  From a 22 oz bottle this poured a beautiful copper color with a slightly off-white head and good thick lacing.  About as wonderful of a nose as you can imagine from a beer, with floral, pine, and citrus hops. Almost eye watering.  A very rich mouthfeel that is almost sticky and you want to hold on your tongue.

Turns to resin, wood, pecan and cocoa  just enough to give great balance to the big malt and floral hops. Medium-heavy body is smooth with mild carbonation, lightly tingly with hops, and has a little touch of alcohol warming.

I actually feel like a slightly fresher bottle would have been nothing but a hop bomb to me (not sure which hop varieties are in here, but I’m pretty sure they’re not my favs), but as consumed, was quite tasty and as mentioned, surprisingly easy drinking for such a quantity of that sweet malt.

It almost smells more like an American barley wine than a IIPA.  The flavor is perfectly balanced with doughy pale malt upfront, and a great juicy citrus (orange and grapefruit) character lingering behind, which works great with the malt.  There is very little to no alcohol flavor and a nice resiny hop finish.  This brew is hoppy, but not insanely so, yet it seems to have a perfect balance between flavoring and bittering hops.

287,"2008-07-02",4.3,"A light shadde of amber with little but lasting head and a bit of lace. Nose has a bit of resin and spicy peach.

First sip is not as much a surprise as a friendly slap in the face. More multifaceted than Im used to in IPAs and quite different. First I think it has roastiness but then I think its more like spiciness. From a spicy curry!  Not entirely sure what spice exactly but perhaps coriander seeds (at first my girlfriend suggest coriander but then shes certain its cardamom).

Mellows out a bit as I get used to it. A fruity resiny tang sticks with it though and the flavour stays fairly robust and its much fuller than I tend to think of IPAs. In a very good way. And its not really malty; its more like mouthfeel through hops, some more hops and then a metric crapassload of hops.

It doesnt feel that bitter on the finish. Well... ""that"" is relative, of course, but the alcohol is noticable in a warming effect as it goes down. Very pleasant and a contender for my top IPA. Easily.

287,"2008-06-15",4.3,"Courtesy fantomas23. This one poured a clear golden orange color with a medium foamy white head that shows nice retention. The aroma is really nice on this one showing all kinds of hops from grapefruit to pine hops. Sweet caramel and butter toffee come through and provide the malt backbone. Fresh tropical fruits of peaches and mangos come through as well. The flavor follows suit with the grapefruit and piney hops attacking the palate with the tropical fruit and caramel malts adding balance and flavor. The taste is amazing on this one with all the fruits and hops coming at you from all angles. Medium-full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel that is smooth and easy to drink with a long bitter finish. Great flavor and perfect balance. This is a world class IIPA and one Ill be seeking out more often.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
287,"2008-06-13",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2010 As much as it hurts to drop this beer down a few notches, I have to do it.  Ive drank it about four times this year, once on tap at the brewpub and a few bottles, and it doesnt measure up to what it used to be.  These were fresh, but it has lost alot of the wonderful grapefruit hoppiness,  more malty, stronger in alcohol, and the body is lacking a bit.  Its still a good damn beer, but almost difficult to enjoy with the constant memory of what it used to be in the back of my mind. FFF, please bring back Dreadnaught!

Bottle.  [rerate]  I just had this wonderful brew a few more times since my original rating.  I think that it deserves an update.  As far as appearance, it is excellent considering the style.  It looks just like an IPA should.  The aroma is the real selling point though.  The huge amount of floral and pine hops grab you and pull you in.  You couldnt resit tasting if you tried. 

[original rating 9/4/10/4/19]
This is my overall favorite IPA so far.  The balance is perfect.  Bitterness, malt, abv, carbonation, it all fits together extremely well.  The bitterness is wonderfully accompanied by the underlying hints of mango and peaches.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"
287,"2008-06-12",4.3,"Everything that an imperial IPA is. Great balance of the bitter hoppiness and malt flavors with undertones of peaches.

287,"2008-06-12",4.5,"8 oz. draft at the brewpub. Poured an ""apple juice"" gold/amber mixed hue with a small bright white head. Aromas are wonderous of floral hops, sweet malts, and mango. Initial taste provides a bitter tart hoppiness, with some wonderful peach / apricot notes that really are special. A nice bitter hoppy finish, but still refreshing and not overpowering despite its power (If that makes sense!!!). Medium bodied with a touch of pine in the finish that is noticeable half way through. Aftertaste lingers very well. A top notch beer that has some wonderful complexities. Will drink again. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
287,"2008-06-10",4.4,"This beer pours a deep orange amber color with a sticky foam head. Lacing remains all the way down the glass. 

The first smell that hits you with this beer is a strong grapefruit aroma, followed by some pine and cut grass. No shortage of hops here!! A fairly strong alcohol presence is also noted in the smell. 

The part of the taste that stands out for me is how much malt backbone there is with this beer. Huge amounts of hops are obvious, but they are balanced equisitely by a strong, malty flavor that compliments the hops. The beer reminds me of ruby red grapegruit juice that has added sugar. 

The mouthfeel is rich and thick, with a smooth carbonation and a crisp finish. 

This beer is extremely well balanced. Im not a hophead by any means, but this beer could convert me. An excellent offering by Three Floyds.","Wake Forest, North Carolina, USA","doppelmeup"

Appearance shows a hazy dark orange pour beautifully crowned with a nice medium white head that diminishes slowly and leaves a thick film and lace.
Aroma is very, very hoppy, intense with citrusy notes of lemon, lime, grapefruit, herbal notes of cannabis, hay, pine, resin and touches of eucaliptus, pommegranate and pineapple.
Flavor is intensely bitter, extreme, citrusy taste with a very malty touch of honey in the background. It reminds me of a dark tea with lemon and honey but with an overwhelming attacking bitterness in the end. Fantastic. Notes of green tea, yerba mate, cannabis, grapefruit... extremely bitter. I could never drink a whole bomber by myself. My 220 ml sample was just fine.
Big body, juicy texture. HIgh carbonation. Good alcoholic presence. The finish is hoppy and astringent leading to a massive hoppy aftertaste that reveals a new dimension of  flavors. Another great extreme American Micro. Never tried such a hoppy beer before.... and I love it.","Hanga Roa, Easter Island, CHILE","Panzerfaust"

Its a blast of flavour but so balanced. The sharp pine and grapefruit flavours are well mixed with a sweet toffee and caramel. As it sits on the tongue, very woody and floral notes arise.

Big citrus hop blast up front with a nice sweet malty aroma to balance it out. Definitely getting major whiffs of orange and grapefruit with some background floral aroma as well.

Poured a nice amber with some haze and an off-white head about 1.5 fingers high. Lacing settled to small rings around the glass as it went down and head disappeared after a bit.

Some grapefruit bitter hints in the smells, but mostly its just dominated by nice hops. Round aroma with just a bit of a bite-very nice. 

The hops hits you right away in the taste and is the dominant character going down although there is some slight maltiness and sweetness mixed in along with the light fruit notes. 

Overall it is a very light and tasty for an IPA this strong and it goes down much smoother than I would have imagined with this sort of ABV.

As good as Dread is, it is not the best Imperial IPA on the planet.  I think it falls behind 90 Min, Majaraha from Avery and Hercules from Great Divide.

Huge piney, mango, pineapple, stingy hop aroma and some smooth malt, only complaint is some alcohol in the nose.    IIPAs are suppose to big and bold and reckless, but this stuff is very nicely refined.  Lots of tropical fruits, very sweet too, this stuff is juicier than a starburst.  The bitterness of the hops come out in the finish.  The finish also has lots of mango in it.  Smooth, very slightly chewy, body and carbonation.  Now I have to try this next to Gooses IIPA.

Very very good but nowhere near what it was last year... last year the hop oils attacked my mouth into a tingling frenzy.  The hops are a bit green and bitter plant like, not nearly as much citrus as last year.  The malts are right, smooth sugary caramel and light honey.

287,"2008-03-05",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2008 Rerate: Fresh bomber.

Well, drewbeerme heard me bitching about this beer being overrated in some drunken forum post of mine, and he took it upon himself to set me straight. Try it fresh, he said, and a few weeks later - after the most recent release - a bottle arrived on my doorstep. I opened it the next day (had to give it one day to sit after its long journal) and dang if he wasnt right. Im not saying this is the best IIPA Ive ever had and Im not even saying it deserves its >4.2 rating, but its certainly a world-class IIPA that belongs right up there near the top at >4.0. Huge leafy aroma, peppermint, herb, resin - the right amount of malt to balance, maybe a slight vegetal off-taste detracting a notch, not too sweet, alcohol hidden away masterfully, light grapefruit and pineapple and just more of that leafy deliciousness. Very nice. Ill let this new rating supersede the old one rather than averaging, as this is clearly the state in which the beer is intended to be sampled. Now I really want to try this one fresh on tap! 

Original rating 3/5/08. Bottle courtesy of sprinkle -- thanks!

Im actually a bit disappointed by this one, and some of that is my fault. I should have opened it the moment it arrived on my doorstep, and instead I waited a couple of months. Id like to try fresh on tap some day. In the meantime, the following is all I can say:

Pours a clear orange with very little head. Perfumy hops on the nose, striking malt presence in the aroma is well. Powerful flavor dominated by soap-and-perfume hops, backed by substantive malts as well. The soap comes on pretty strong, maybe peach/mango flavored soap, but soap nonetheless. And unfortunately this one already showing some oxidization as well. That mars the flavor somewhat, and Im left with a beer that is definitely burly and enjoyable in that its not a too-sweet IIPA -- but its a beer that Im not blown away by. Mouthfeel, at least, is very good with the alcohol not at all apparent. 7% would be entirely believable. 

Gotta try it fresh, I guess. 7/4/6/4/15=3.6","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
287,"2008-03-04",4.0,"Overrated?  Hard to tell.  Transparent orange, amber color with a thin, creamy, white head.  Aroma is more mild than I would have imagined, plenty of citrus, grapefruit, definitely some tropical fruits and peach.  Although mild, the aroma was rather unique and no pine aromas that accompany other DIPAs.  Flavor has plenty of sweet, subtle malt with toffee and butter flavors at first.  Next the hop flavors overwhelm the tongue, grass, grapefruit, grapes, peach, basically any fruit you can think of you can find in the hop flavors - again, a distinct lack of pine and not very resiny.  Finish is bitter, but not killer, and the beer has a very full, slightly thick, mouthfeel.  Extremely well balanced from nose to finish.  For my money though, Ill take a HopSlam before Id reach for this.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
287,"2008-03-02",3.6,"Not bad, but I tend to like my IPAs a little more toned down on the aftertaste.  This is like Two Hearted Ale times 5.  It is thicker, hoppier, but I cant say better.

Rather still on the tongue. Big hop flavor again mostly citrus and tropical fruit. Has some vegetative and metallic notes. Soft palate and perfect bitterness. Little perceived alcohol.

287,"2008-02-22",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2008 Split from a bomber, part of a great trade with StFun. Poured a cloudy orange with a slight head. Might have poured it too cold. ""Amethyst,"" says my buddy Brendan. Floral hoppy aroma, not as powerful as I expected. Taste: Wow... not as overwhelming on the hop end as I expect. Citrusy hops ride atop a very pronounced caramel malt backbone. Extremely well balanced. Alcohol is hidden remarkably well. Very smooth, long lasting finish. Wish I could drink this beer all the time. 

Addendum: Compared side-by-side with Bells Hopslam. The aroma on the Dreadnaught is very different from the the Hopslams piney assault -- it has more caramel, toffee notes.  The FFF has a lot more body.. Hopslam seems a bit fizzy in comparison.","New Jersey, USA","mcferc4"

287,"2008-02-22",5.0,"Nothing surpasses the joy I feel when a new batch of Dreadnaught hits the local stores. Well, almost nothing. If you are planning to consume this beer it must be poured into the proper glassware. If you do not have this, wait to consume the beer. 

Poured into a tulip of course, this beer is orange, with an inch of white head. It fades, but maintains a small head. Some lace clings to the glass. 

It has been far to long since I have enjoyed this smell. I could get a similar effect from sniffing a pine cone. Some citrus is thrown in there as well. This is the finest nose of any IIPA I have encountered. I feel the same way about the taste. There is a barrage of piney, citrus infused artillery, with a single burst of sweet, caramel malt fire in the midst of all that. 

The mouthfeel is lightly, very creamy. That is not a typo. Drinkability is high. I use that word often, so to be more specific, I have been known to drink three of these in a night. Im just rambling here, but wine connoisseurs pay a lot more for a comparable amount of the finest wines in the world, however, many breweries put out equally world class beers at considerably less price. 

Edit: I must blame my 4.5 appearance score the last time on a dirty glass. Tonights pour into a thoroughly rinsed glass yielded the two inch head and blanketing lace that I expect from INs finest.

The lovely aroma shows massive notes of seemingly every hop variety, from bittersweet grapefruit to fresh cut grass and resinous pine.  Buttery toffee and sweet, rich caramel provide the massive malt base that it needs to stand up to the hop onslaught.  Fresh peaches and mangos add complimentary fruitiness and depth.  The flavor follows these same lines.  The richness of the buttery toffee stands up very well to the bitterness of the grapefruit and pine.  Tropical notes emerge from the thick liquid and spread out across the mouth, adding a soothing effect.  Soon after, however, the long, bitter finish attacks the roof of the mouth and reminds you who is boss.

Not much head, but this was a fairly weak pour on my part.  Aroma is just great...fruity hops dominate, and not being an IBU freak, the aspect of hops I appreciate most is the aroma, and this did not disappoint in the least bit!  Definitely getting the peach aroma listed in the description along with some grapefruit and other citrus fruits, and a bit of piney hops in there as well.  I think the wide range of hop aromas is what set this one over the top, and in a good way.  Flavor is very crisp and clean, and FFF got a bit of malt in there to offset the crazy hops, and this malt is what makes this beer one to talk about.  The malt backbone is balanced by beautiful levels of citrus hops:  grapefruit, orange and lemon dominate, and the hop bitterness is at a solid, but not obscene level, throughout. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy and oily, but pleasant.  Not much alcohol to speak of, and the bitterness is there at the finish, but in a very good way that just keeps you wanting to keep sipping until its gone.

Sweet grapefruit, pine sap, biscuity malt, some sweeter citruses like tangerine and orange on the nose. 

Hops obviously control the show here, but the range of hop flavors keeps it from being overly one-dimensional. Obviously grapefruit has a strong presence, as well as orange, citrus zest, and maybe even peach. A decent amount of malt futilely fights the whirlwind of hops. 

The carbonation really is perfect. I cant imagine a more finely carbonated IPA. I spent about as much time swirling the beer around the glass and watching the cascades of lacing form and dissolve as I did drinking! Mesmerizing stuff. Great brew.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Taste is more hops.  floral hops give way to a great grapefruity flavor with some caramel malts.  A fantastic DIPA.  The alcohol is well hidden and going through this 22 oz bottle was no challenge.

287,"2008-01-21",4.3,"22oz bomber, 2005 vintage, from  CaptainCougar. Pours a very attractive, slightly hazy orange - when held up to the light, you can see a rainbow of highlights ranging from yellow to copper. The head pours up medium in thickness, but doesnt persist long - after it passes, there is a thin, spotted layer of off-white foam that laces the glass heavily. The aroma is thick and hoppy. There are lots of hops in that aroma - citrus and pit fruit. And there are also lots of malts in the aroma - complex  and full of caramel, like an overly hopped English barley wine (if the bottle were from 2007, the hops would likely be much more pungent). The beer starts with a malty, cakey sweetness that is clean and delightfully sweet - just the right amount of sweetness to balance the awesome hop flavor - flowery and fruity: dates, mangos, and oranges. In the middle of the tongue, the big, flowery, citrus hop flavor begins to give way to a mild, earthy bitterness combined with a big, thick, caramel, toffee, doughy maltiness. The bitterness grows substantially towards the finish. The finish is dry, grassy, and bitter with hints of resin, pine sap, and honey. The finish also has a big dose of malts that is, like components of the aroma, reminiscent of an English barleywine. The mouthfeel is perfect - it starts full in body but seems to get lighter as it finds its way towards your gullet. The carbonation level is nice - it adds a subtle sting that complements the big hop flavor nicely, and it makes for a nice creamy texture. Overall, very nice - I really want to try a fresher bottle now to see just how big and bold the hops are.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

If I had to find on thing against it, there was a huge contrast of sweet and bitter, but nothing in between.

There is a very strong sweet malty taste and enough hops to balance and stand out, but again, they dont dominate the flavor. I think that Im getting more accustomed to hoppier beers, so it might be a bit before I can get a stable base to review from. That being said, it is still a good beer.

The Dreadnaught is peachy in the nose; the Green Flash is ganja and grass. Not suprisingly, the taste matches. Besides that, the Green Flash has more hop sting aftertaste; the Dreadnaught has more of a warm syrupy aftertaste. Both impeccable. I personally prefer the Green Flash.

2004 is still mostly sweet crystal malt with a bit more of the hops coming in the flavor but still light on the bitterness, 
2005 aroma is same oxidized malt but the flavor is picking up even more citrus hops and a long bitter finish kicks in
2006 still has the oxidized aroma with just a touch more hops, flavor is well balanced between the hops and sweet crystal malt, 
2007 aroma is spot on with fresh hops to balance the crystal malt, flavor is well balanced between the big hops and sweet crystal malt, lasting bitter finish carries the hop and malt flavor,

Im a huge fan of double IPAs and this one has such a malty biscuit-juice like backbone, I was pleased how that layer counterbalances the bitter pine cone grapefruit-esque hops which stand out in the finish. Balance is not an operative word here with the intensity of flavors all around. A bit too much on the tea side with that bittersweet honey biscuit flavor but all around an enjoyable beer.

I love my IBUs in a IR stout, but when the beer is straight-up hops slapping me in the face, Im not so much a fan.  This is undoubtedly a hell of a brew.  It pours a viscous copper, and sits in the glass with the color and luster of gem-grade amber.  A tiny off-white head forms slowly and laces like crazy.  the scent is delightful, syrup-thick with grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, all other manner of tangy fruti, and mountains of bitter floral hops.  The smallest sip coats the mouth completely, assaulting the palate with hops.  Grapefruit dominates, with hints of other fruits and a touch of resinous pine on the finish.  This brew is  full of molasseses sweetness, too. That would actually be my main complaint; the sweetness can realy become cloying by the end of the glass. The finish is long, with bruising hop bitterness overpowering the sweetness of the lingering body.  Overall: wow, the flavor is INTENSE.  I had to have a sip of water after each sip of beer to keep my thirst under control and clean my palate.  I can certainly appreciate this beer, but Its not my bag.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","RolandTower"

287,"2007-07-16",4.8,"I flew to Chicago and drove to Munster, Indiana for this beer. After loading the rent-a-suv, I drove straight home, to Boston with it. 

This I.P.A. Came in a 22oz. Bomber. Once poured (into one of those new engineered Sam Adams glasses) the head is small and disappears quickly. The beer has a fairly floral hop aroma. 

It has a very fruity hop flavor that lingers for a few moments. You will honestly want another gulp and then another glass. It feels a little filling in your mouth with the pops of various fruit and that delicious hops. Once down the hatch you quickly find a beer that isnt as filling as youd assume. 

I find this beer to be an awesome example of what an IPA should be. Hoppy floral aromas with a fruit/hoppy taste and after taste that doesnt overwhelm. This beer aims to please the hop head with making you feel like youre chewing on hops. Over-all an aweseome beer. Heck I flew to Chicago and drove to the brew pub to buy this stuff. Then drove home 18 straight hours for it.","USA","RIXbeer"

Aroma of floral and piney hops, a brown-sugary malt note, peaches, and other citrus.  Initial taste is a blast of sweet, hoppy goodness.  Smooooooth!!  As it opened up a little more I could pick up on a rock candy quality which still retained that big hop kick.  What I ultimately like about this is the hops dont overpower the other flavors bounding about in it, they do their business, put the money on the table and jet, leaving an indelible mark on my tongue.  This is a very fine IIPA, probably my favorite of the IIPAs.  8, 4, 10, 5, 19.  Draft re-rate:  Dark orange in color with a nice white head.  Nose is big on the grapefruit with some other citrus and a subtle pine note...pure hop juice.

287,"2007-07-06",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2007 My 50th beer rating.  Color was a nice cloudy orange, aroma was hoppy citrusy, and slightly sweet.  Unfortunately I tried this beer a little too cold, and at first it didnt seem much like a double ipa to me.  When, cold, the hops dominate, with citrus up front, subsiding to a piney dry aftertaste.  Still, it is remarkably well balanced, and smooth.  Again, it did not seem much like a double ipa, because it was lacking a strong malt sweetness to it.  Then I let it warm up.  This beer probably had the biggest change of any Ive had when it came to temperature.  After it had warmed, the hops seemed to intermingle with a nice warm sweetness from the malts.  It became more balanced.  The flavor became much sweeter and a mango-hop flavor appeared.  Overall: a nicely balanced iipa, with wonderfull complexity that appears as it warms.  I dont if Id pay $12 for it, and travel out of state, but it was certainly one of the most enjoyable beers Ive ever had.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","jvmiller"

287,"2007-07-05",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2007 bottle.  wow a chance to try one of the worlds best.  pours hazy amber with a nice head and little foam that stays on top the way I like it.  Stone ruinition and GDs hercules also has this kind of head.   This one has a delightful lacing on the sides as well.  Nice mouthfeel, nice body.   Extremely well balanced. Yes maybe I smell mango and peach hints. Big hops that rise in the aftertaste then fall off and leave a bitter dry mouth feeling.  This occurs with such speed that it reminds me of the way wasabi grows hotter then fades quickly.  There is also a faint sourdough (yeast) taste that I dont like.  The main beer guru that I visit regularly said this used to be better without that sourdough taste.  As a native of Indiana, I am so proud to have this brewery here in Muenster, IN.  But I have to tell the truth.  This isnt the best, and even if it is the top echelon of Imperial IPAs, it has a lot of fast company. rr.....  although this may not be my favorite right now ... it is one of the most distict IPAs.

287,"2007-06-30",3.5,"I poured this ale into a standard pint glass which produced a almost non-existent head of white foam.  The body of the ale was a cloudy amber, with no particles in the first pour.   Perhaps it was the fact that I chilled the ale first, but I could not discern as dynamic of an aroma as I have experienced from other Floyds products.  Once the aroma started coming in, I was able to scent a bit of floral and hops, with the peach mentioned in the original description. The first sip grabbed me by the lapels (which was a sharp contrast from the light aroma.  Sharp bitterness ran down the center of my tongue as a bit of sweetness crept into the side.  I found this contrast to be a little jarring to the overall experience.   The bitterness of this ale was almost overpowering and lasted for quite a while, perhaps to cover the back notes of alcohol.  Overall, I was greatly put off by the bitterness, my taste  buds were blind-sided by this this brew, but I will forgive Three Floyds since this does provide a good quick buzz.  Not a chuggin beer!  (Take Two): Second pour, since this was from a 22 oz bottle, produced the following:  Head was better and lasted longer, rocky and settling into little islands of foam.  Aroma was stronger with the aforementioned hoppiness and peach.  Flavor was more balanced on the second go as well, with the sweetness becoming more prevalent as the brew warms up.  The pine flavor and bitterness is still there, though not as strong as before.  Id be lying though if I said that you cant tell theres alcohol.  The 9.5% sneaks up on you and its not wholly unpleasant.  This ale has taught me an important lesson in serving temperatures: Not all beer should be served ice-cold.","Plainfield, Illinois, USA","popephred"

As soon as I popped this open I could immediately smell grapefruit. Poured into a snifter a hazy orange/amber. Big bright orange highlights when held to the light. With a big creamy head on top that lasts. Moderate sticky lacing throughout the entire glass.

The smell is unbelievable. Its loaded with big juicy citrus hops. Sugared grapefruit along with a sprinkling of orange juice that smells like it was freshly squeezed. There is tropical fruit as well. Mango...all kinds of deliciousness. There is a touch of pine in the nose too. I sit here smelling this and my mouth just waters uncontrollably. Exceptional!

I almost expected to be let down when I drank this because of all the high praise. Im not let down one bit and I now understand why this is praised as much as it is. Theres a ton of the citrus in the taste thats in the aroma. As I drink this my mouth actually waters after the swallow. A smooth bitterness but by no means overwhelming. Amazing!

I find it difficult giving such praise but I try and find faults in Dreadnaught but have a very hard time doing so. Its medium bodied but coating. Balanced. The alcohol is non-existent in the mouthfeel. Unbelievable!

The drinkability for a beer of this size is downright sick. This my sound cliche but Dreadnaught is very dangerously drinkable. Every sip makes your mouth need another immediately afterwards. Dangerous!

I hate giving such high scores cause it would mean this beer is almost impossible to improve upon. To tell you the truth it would be almost impossible to improve on.

287,"2007-05-11",4.4,"Lacing in a glass of this beer is almost as thick as the liquid that produced it. The head is full, rocky, well retained and lasts until the final draw. Cloudy orange/copper body appears oily, luminescent with only the dimmest lighting available. Aroma is gorgeous, a true grand expression of an astounding hop combination. Mango, apricot, pine, earthy herbs, peach, orange pith; the hops are delicious long before the first sip. Alcohol is well concealed but tingles the tip of my nose with the forceful inhalation I subject myself to...I just want to revel in the wonderful scents. Bready malts are plentiful enough to demand recognition, soft enough to sidestep interfering with the fruit basket in liquid form I cant get enough of. Also noted are fresh florist shop scents and lavender hints. This isnt the best nose Ive encountered in a double IPA, but its awful close. Flavor is just as wonderful, much more balanced as well. Moderate malt charater is very sweet and slightly doughy, slightly peppery. Very light acidity. For such a boisterous hop shot in the nose, this is exceedingly drinkable and only mildly bitter. Finishes with good balance of malt and hops, moderately dry and lightly spicy. Oily and slick mouthfeel, incredibly smooth and full bodied. Its also ludicrously creamy. I suppost that if this were a draft sample Id have scored it even higher, those samples in the past seem a touch more memorable. As it stands, this rating is from a fresh bottle.

Overall, a rich malty sweet IPA loaded with fruit flavors and a generous hop bite.  Not a personal favorite though, it was fairly hard to drink a whole bomber.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"
287,"2007-05-05",4.0,"Bomber. Pours hazy, very orange copper with thin ivory head. The nose is lots of pineapple, mandarin orange, mango, wheat bread, and a wisp of alcohol. The flavor is more piney than the nose, but has a good dose of fruit as well-- grapefruit, various tropical fruits. It is a little bit woody in the middle, with some brown sugar sweetness. Bitter finish with grapefruit and some tannicity and a round alcohol warmth. Quite good.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

Smelled of crushed pine needles, malty cereal grain, and a touch of citrus. Medium bodied and slightly sweet. Fruity flavor with hints of citrus, peach, and apricot. There is also some biscuity malt and alcohol. Moderate hop bitterness that peaks at the end and lingers. The alcohol warms as it settles into the stomach.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

Aroma is resinous with citrus hops, some exoctic fruit (possibly some mango), pine and some candy flavors.  Taste is citrus hops, caramel malt, sharp spruce taste, light lime.  Its pretty complex.  Alcohol is well hidden and carbonation is moderate.  All and all a great IIPA, however Bells Hopslam still would be my preferred choice.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"

Slightly syrupy pour, but still some decent white lacing going on. Earthy and toasty floral hop aroma as soon as the bottle is cracked it open, as well as rum barrel, and orange cheesecake notes, improving with temperature increase.  Very smooth mouthfeel towards the end. Heavy malt, pine sap and grapefruit in the flavor, excellent! This beer is surprisingly well-balanced for the high ABV. Palate finishes smooth and silky in the mouthfeel, with a good bitter kick. Definitely an ass-kicker of a DIPA.

Much less resemblence of a barleywine than my first sampling about 6 months ago...Great job of balancing this one out and hiding that alcohol.  Flavor wise, I thought it was outstanding --- citruisy, piney, grapefruit, with a dominance of oranges - great mouthfeel/full bodied.  Overall, an outstanding beer - very few IIPAs out there could go toe to toe with Dreadnaught.   I could drink loads of this...just too expensive.","San Francisco, California, USA","jarspag"

2/13/08, bottle from Im almost positive, the fresh early 2008 batch. pours clear golden with white head. nose has raw, gritty, grassy, grainy notes. not a beautiful hop bomb to say the least. flavor is rather bitter but lacks an interesting hop profile, intensely grapefruity at first but that drops off so fast leaving a grainy alcohol finish. watery body is probably what contributes to such a poor flavor-palate length. oh boy what happened to this beer? people have been noticing a decline in this brew over the past few years but this is obvious. pales in comparison to the pliny the younger I had 5 days ago. rating unchanged because further research is needed. 6/4/7/3/13=3.3.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
287,"2007-04-02",3.7,"Pretty high expectations for this brew given its ratings. Nice bottle label. Hops are pretty well masked by all the malt and ABV in this, pretty fruity for my tastes. I thought this would be tough to put down because it would be hop overload, but it went down quite smooth, nice brew, but in general I think I prefer single IPAs just for the fact that you typically can taste more hop bite.","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","incutrav"

287,"2007-03-31",4.6,"Orange and somewhat cloudy, with a very hoppy aroma.  A very hoppy flavor as well, with a smooth, creamy palate.  It reminded me of a ""triple"" IPA.  Dreadnaught is a classic example of the American DIPA style.","Chester Springs, Pennsylvania, USA","RoboHop"
287,"2007-03-30",4.4,"Pours a dark copper. First glass has no foam, second glass has 1 finger. Very minimal lacing. Aroma is predominantly sweet malts with plenty of hops behind it. Pine hops slightly overpower the citrus and floral, but its a nice blend. Taste is hard to pin down. The sweet malts blend nicely with the hops. The interesting hop blend is not as aggressive as I would expect from 3Fs. Not too sweet, which is my primary complaint in the genre. Very easy to drink by DIPA standards. Mouthfeel is creamy and does not get syrupy. If this were $6 instead of $11 for a 22oz it would be a no-brainer.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Duster72"

The hops arent overwhelming, in the aroma at least.  A lot of citrus in the aroma as well.  Taste is hoppy, bitter, oily, and tingly in the mouth.  The sweet and citrus notes in the aroma are prevalent in the taste as well.  A never ending bitter finish.  This is an interesting beer.  Complex with a nice balance between the citrus and bitter flavors.  

Re-rate.  After having 3 bottles of this I can say that the freshness factors in significantly.  My initial rating was for a pretty old bottle.  Since I have tried a relatively fresh one and the hop flavor and aroma are amazing.  Absolute perfect taste and a measuring stick for every other hoppy beer.  The sweetness is perfect and natural unlike some other cloying IIPAs (Im looking at you Hercules).  Really an amazing beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
287,"2007-03-22",3.8,"Bottle in trade with Puddintane (respect Dave). Theres no doubt this is a huge beer. From beginning to end it crashes through your senses, challenging you to keep up with it. Certainly one of the most fruity, flowery beers Ive ever smelt, with lots of apricot, peach and melon, as well as rose petals and wet stone. Upfront its massively sweet, almost syrupy - like someones drained the juice from a tin of tropical fruit into the bottle. Then the hops slide in, balancing out most - but by no means all - the sweetness, to leave a pleasant hop-tingle finish. The bottle conditioning delivers a wonderfully soft mouthfeel, with just a prickle of carbonation. What marks it down for me is the concentrated sweetness - too much tropical syrup for my taste buds - which in turn makes it a touch sickly to drink a lot of. I love hops, but delivered in a slightly cleaner, more refreshing way. That said, this is fab beer and a bottle I wont ever forget.","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"
287,"2007-03-20",4.1,"bottle. Sampled most recently apres-ski this past sunday. Orange amber with a moderate off-white head. Big, citric, hoppy aroma.

287,"2007-03-19",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2007 A hop lovers dream?  You bet ya.  The problem is that while I like hopiness, this is just overpowering for my taste.  Hazy orange color  with a white head.  I love the smell of this beer....versy strong with an almost floral scent.  Like most FFFs, this beer has a creamy mouthfeel and explosive flavors.  I would have rated higher, but as stated earlier its just a little too hoppy for my personal taste.

UPDATE:  I just had this beer again and had to give it another point for aroma.  It seems now that I am beginning to be much more of a hop lover than I was and thats what makes this beer smell so great.  Its Incredible.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","jameswolfe"

Decent head a lacing. Aroma was more about the malts than expected. For the rep of this beer, I feared that my nose hairs would burn off sniffing this sucker.  Taste is beautiful blast of citrus hops with a heavy creamy toasty malt backbone.  Very creamy indeed and had a great finish to it.  I can only imagine what it would be like fresh from the brewery. No astringency noted and the alcohol was well hidden.  Fantastic brew and was almost more balanced than I thought going into it.  It was a flavour explosion on an otherwise dull March Saturday. Best of show in the throwdown.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","oakbluff"
287,"2007-03-17",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2007 Bottled sample via Oakbluff on IIPA Saturday. Bold hop aromas with loads of citrus and soft stone fruit notes. Perhaps just the slightest touch of roasted malt aroma.  More citrus fruit in the mouth with elements of pine, crystal malt sweetness and a bit of breadiness. Quite heavy in the mouth. Not quite as dry as my favorite IIPAs, but a quality brew nonetheless. Huge thanks to Oakbluff for sharing this beauty.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"

287,"2007-03-01",4.8,"(2006 version) poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter glass

A: Looks like many top-quality DIPAs should look, a deep orange rust color, very clouded or murky. You wont be reading a book while peering through this beer. Very little head but nice oily lacing.

S: Oh so complex! Some mouth-watering malted bread scents meld beautifully with citrusy and perfumy-like floral hops. I even detect some notes of vanilla and peach. Sweet but not cloyingingly so.

T/M: Amazingly well-balanced double IPA, delicious mixture of fruity citrus & moderately toasted malts; VERY bitter grapefruit finish, massive hops, lingers a long time; slightly syrupy, but just enough carbonation to make it easy to take larger sips; damned near perfect.

D: If this wasnt bomber-only, and 9.3% ABV, Id request a Dreadnaught transfusion instead of blood. But alas, its not, so Ill just drink as much of it as I can. :-)

Started out pouring from the bottle to a bright orange-red, with thick off-white head that stayed around for the entire glass, and excellent lacing. Initial aroma was strongly hoppy citrus, mainly grapefruit and oranges. However, as the beer warmed, the aroma became more influenced by a malty sweet aroma. Likewise, the flavor, which started out heavily on the bitter, hoppy citrus side, while retaining that throughout, became nicely blended with a malty sweet syrupy taste. Alcohol also made itself more known as the beer warmed, perfectly complementing the hops and malts.

The citrus was grapefruit and a bit of orange coupled with a nice malty backbone comprised of base malt and caramel. Crystal clear copper with a very low slight head which barely lasted to lace the glass. The flavor was peachy and contained a nice piney, grassy and fruity hop presence. The flavor which began as peach quickly changed over to a lemony grapefruit citrus with a bit of orange. The malt backbone was well done and the bittering came across as very, very smooth.

287,"2007-02-15",4.9,"This is a spectacular brew. I also speak for 3 people here so let it commence: The brews smell was that of grapefruit and hops. The flavour is bitter but not astringent. More of the grapefruit is present than other citrus hints....I am in tuned to grapefruit as it is one of my fav. citruses. There is a bit of tartness but not bitter and follows to a clean finish begging for aother sip. The head is white and semi-thick (translucent) and pours a gorgeous golden-orange. The inital taste is that of bitterness then finishes cleanly with a bit of palate coating citrus. In my eyes a good finish. My brothers analysis of this was a bitter aroma in which he could smell the hops with a flavor of grapefruit but not overwhelming. One he said he would not go out and order specifically but definately drink if the bar was open so to speak. My sister-in law said the aroma was that of peaches....where my brother and I wer like ""okay where did that come from?"" It did not fit a girls taste as much as ours. This is a near perfect beer yet again raising my hopes for DarkLord day. If you want a palate clenser or complexifier try drinking a bit of 100% ruby red grapefruit juice with it. It WILL change the flavor dramatically. I know because I am on number 2 and wanted to experiment. This is not the most extreme brew I have been able to drink ABV% wise but overall a fine brew. $10 per 22oz will however keep me from buying mass quantities.----Overall concensentuious is a drinkable brew in which my brother could actually finish...as could I. Thank you FFF for an amazing experience and a memorable one at that. Simply superb and fitting in the top 15 brews from around the world.

In the mouth it is totally consuming, with total bitterness and pine domination but with a consistent mid-taste of orange liquour that lifted this beer into the realm of the 4s. It has good mouthfeel, but the aftertaste is smooth..like an iced tea. I wanted a bit more of the bitterness to linger, but it doesnt and I cant tell if that is good or bad. Thanks to my dad for bringing this great beer down to Panama over Xmas. As I finish the 22oz. bottle, with a warm happiness, I have found that this beer only gets better with warmth.

Starts out way hoppy - pine, citrus, and a wee bit spicy. Then the malt comes in - smooth, sugar-sweet, and a hint of melon. Then the pine hops in the aftertaste. And then a sweetness coats the tongue in a thin layer. Spicy and alcoholic in the aftertaste. Full bodied.

287,"2007-01-19",4.2,"#500 rating. 22 oz bomber courtesy of Degarth. Thanks Joe, this is one of the brews Ive been looking forward to trying for some time now. Cracked it open during the 8:30pm replay of The Colbert Report with guest Papa Bear Bill OReilly. The beer poured copper with quickly dissipating white head. The aroma has lots of pine, sweet malts creating biscuit and bread notes, some melony-ness, bubble gum, and maybe a hint of citrus. The taste has the nice full mouthfeel reminding you youre drinking something with assertiveness here. Pine hops hit up front with bitterness slowly giving way to a bit of pine hop flavor sweetness. About midway some maltiness surfaces for added sweetness and slight roastiness. Then the pine hop bitterness begins to build into the finish and aftertaste. No sense of the ABV. Delicious beer.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
287,"2007-01-19",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2007 Poured from bomber into my Dogfish pint glass.
Pours a hazy ruby/light brown color with almost no head at all. Slight rings of lace around the top of the glass.
Smell is hops. Juicy, citrusy, piney and floral! This is really a very good smelling beer. The smell itself lets me know that Ive got something good here.
Taste is incredible. Everything one should look for in a DIPA and then some. It slams your tastebuds with a wide array of hops and a slight alcohol sense. With a pretty bitter taste coming through midway to the end. It all finishes clean and juicy, making you reach for the glass wanting another drink.
Mouthfeel is is perfect. Not too thick, not too thin. Just right. A good amount of carbonation and malt to balance this out. I was expecting a really bitter overly hopped beer. But this is really balanced and very, very good.
I dont think I would want to drink more than a bomber of this in a sitting. Im quickly becoming a bigger fan of Three Floyds with every beer I try. If you havent tried this one, you havent had the best DIPA yet.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

287,"2007-01-16",4.1,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Deep, golden orange body with a thick layer of well sustaining fizzy off-white, golden head.  Loads of hops in the aroma, supplemented by a canteloupe-like malty sweetness.  Pink grapefruit juice and orange zest abound to create a citrus fruit hoppy bouquet, softened by a squeeze of mango.  Full bodied, creamy carbonated mouthfeel.  Slightly sweet, ridiculously juicy start on the palate, just dripping with freshly squeezed oranges and pink grapefruits.  Im quite impressed by how soft the mouthfeel is.  The hop characters are also quite rounded and soft, considering the obvious dominance - I wonder what vintage this bottle is?  It was consumed just days after purchase in the store.  Most of the hop bitterness comes out on the back end, again citrusy, will some soft notes of red pine.  An extremely well hidden alcohol slowly warms during the final smack.  Quite tasty overall; Im rather suprised how much Im enjoying this beer considering I usually shy away from big bodied IPAs.  Id like to taste it fresh on tap sometime to experience the maximum possible punch in the face from the hops.  Thanks, Dillon!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

This is a really seriously potent DIPA, and it really knocks you down with all that hoppy potency it smells great, lots of hops right there in the nose.  The taste though is pretty phenomenal.  Although I had it after many other beers, I may still say that I prefer DFH 90 minute to this brew, maybe its out of habbit, but thsi brew seems to lack some of the complexity of the 90 minute.

287,"2007-01-12",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2007 This beer is light and refreshing with abundant and delicious citrus notes, but at the same time packs a big hop wallop. Dreadnought lives in its own place on the beer landscape, as it closely walks the yin-yang line between certain attributes. It is both extremely light and bitter/heavy, it is very sessionable yet satisfying, and is drinkable yet strong. This beer can be wonderful, my only complaint is that over a handful of times Ive had this beer, its character (or quality? or age?) has been extremely inconsistent. The bottle I had the other day was delightful and everything good I remember about this brand from the first time I had it (on-tap at Three Floyds). But Ive also had bottles of this that are extremely malty and stale. The bad bottles Ive had are made worse by the hefty price tag ($10 for a big bottle) this beer frequently carries.

<P>
Body is a dark tea colored hue with a firm and lasting thumb thick tan head. Aroma is a full frontal assault of citrus and pine hops that leave nothing else to smell save some vague sweet maltiness that leans to fruit, but who can really tell with their nose hair seared off. This doesnt smell, it attacks. You can tell the ingredients are quality, but it is like too many spices in the gravy.
<P>
Fore is thick and oily with a colossal hop presence that is bitter enough to cause one to recoil. The hop acids are so thick you can feel resin building in your throat. Curiously though it isnt bitter so much as it is oily. If you just love hop oil this is nirvana. If you like the hops to stay in the back and play second fiddle or to be crazy bitter this beer will drive you crazy, like it is driving me. I literally cant taste anything else but the tongue burning hottness of hop oils.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

Aroma of varying complexity detailing the use of several native and imported hop varieties.  However, a slight dampness to it.  The poor malt character is beat-up and abused with this one to the point of being taken out of balance to compliment the complexities of the hops.  The palate is sharp, grapefruity and citrus.

The head is very small with almost no lacing.  The tase is bitter but I cant say anything else interesting about it.  There isnt a lot of carbonation and it almost tastes flat to me.  I actually (gulp) poured out some of the first bomber because I though it might be bad.  But alas, the second tasted the same.  Just doesnt do anything for me.","Delaware, USA","LennyH"

Enormous sweet sticky citric fruity nose. The attack and the mid-palate are almost roastily bitter with resinous hop. This seems to have every conceivable hop category mized into one: citric, piney, resinous, even bits and pieces of herb and spice. No earth, so I guess you cant say its the esperanto of hopping, but its pretty close. Malts there, kind of the silent partner. Great stuff, but that first wallop of flavors a doozy.

I....must.....find.....more....please!!","Oceanside, California, USA","ChazMania"
287,"2006-09-30",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 Now that Ive come back from the GABF floor and reviewed the comments on the beers that I tasted I feel vindicated mostly.  These blind tastings concluded with a confirmation from the accumulated RateBeer community on my thoughts, except for the Dreadnaught.  I knew Three Floyds was an important brewery to hit, and I knew theyre beers were going to be good, but I didnt know which ones were going to be the epic beers Ive heard stories about.  Thus, when I sampled the Dreadnaught I found it to be an acceptably good beer.  But now that Ive come back to the community and checked my word against everyone elses I feel like a fool.  I had no idea it was the God beer, the IPA that drinkers should prostrate before.  I sense that there are small shrines scattered around the country in homes and on roadsides dedicated to this hopped up beer.  If Im ever going to take a stand, though, and really rally against the crowd then I want to do it here.  The smell is vivid  pine resin, flowers and a general aroma that smacks of the Rocky Mountains in a way that only a traveler to the little rocky villas ensconced in the craggy pock marks of the mountains could understand.  This, paired with its bucolic semi-translucent marigold color topped with an orange blossom head projects a beautiful natural air.  But the Dreadnaughts taste is less enchanting.  It starts strong and savory, with a triad wheat, biscuit and oats and then mixes into a grapefruit sweetness which is unlike anything Ive had save for the Alpha King.  It makes for an intriguing mix of the bready IPAs and the bitter grapefruity IPAs and something I enjoy a lot.  But besides these qualities it seems to lack an edge of sophistry that would make it a legend in my heart.  It is, still, an altogether admirable beer and deserves the praise it receives  but not the worship.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
287,"2006-09-23",4.2,"22 oz Bottle:  The grapefruit and peach aromas hit you as soon as the bottle is opened.  Pours a thick, full bodied, orange color with a thin head.  Saying that the fruit flavors are intense is an understatement.  There is a sweet cascade hop start and a slightly bitter finish.  9.5% alcohol is unnoticeable; it feels like 5% at the most.  Citrus aftertaste stays with you forever.  Im not that into IPAs but I certainly appreciate the complexity of this masterpiece.","USA","Rooney31"
287,"2006-09-23",3.9,"22 oz bottle.  I waited for a month to share this with a fellow beer taster - the anticipation was killing me.  This was very, very good but not my favorite IPA.  The color and appearance were as nice as Ive ever seen.  Aroma was citrus, alcohol and pine - taste followed accordingly.  Taste had a distinguishing malt characteristic as well.  Heavy IPA.  Very smooth and balanced. 3Floyds is an excellent brewery.  Must try this if you can find it.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","bdjames29"

Good balance of malts and hops and although the hops are totally present, they are pretty sucessfully staved off by the malts.  Ripe, carmelized apricot and peach flavors mingle with rest in this brew. I had this on tap a few years ago and loved it.

287,"2006-09-15",4.3,"This beer pours a light orangish peach with some slight shades of brown. The head is a buttery light yellow egg shell film that left some very attractive strands of lace.

Smells like a walk through a pine forest after the rain. Theres also a little mandarin orange here as well. The fresh hops oozing out of this one really have my attention.

The flavor really caught me off guard. I was expecting a big hop punch in the mouth like Alpha King, but instead, I get a sublime doughy oats and honey malt that transitions into a crisp pine bough dryness that rides on top of the malt. There are also some sweet hints of oranges and peaches along the sides of my tongue. The bitterness of the hops in the finish is effortlessly blended into a toasted oat with a touch of fruity sweetness that lingers on a little too long. 

The mouth feel is silky smooth and a little heavy with a great micro carbonation that gives this beer an terrific body.

Im diggin this one. The smell is organic and fresh, the taste is subtle and supreme, and the mouth feel is right on. 9.5%? I wouldnt have believed it had I not seen in on the site. Im glad I caught that. Now I can try to pace out this bomber!","South Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","DTB"
287,"2006-09-14",4.8,"What a lovely beverage. An expensive $11 or $12 whenever you can find it in southern Indiana, but well worth the price of admission. Appearance is attractive, but not awe inspiring. Clear amber body is topped by a small, but sturdy, vanilla head. Sparse, patchy lacing is left on the glass. Aroma cranks up the experience a few notches. Incredible, citrusy, hops jump into your nasal passages. Freshly sliced, orange and green lime open into esters of pink grapefruit and tangerine. Sublime! Full and tantalizing in the mouth. Carbonation is lively, but unobtrusive. Taste is bittersweet, citrusy, hops, similar to the luscious aroma. Lime, orange zest, and a fleeting, caramel and honey sweetness play along together like three year old cousins in a sandbox. Hops finish things off as a polite assasin. Geeeez.., this is an impressive ""beer"". An American classic! From my many years of experience, only some of the aged, Plinys from Russian River Brewing in Sonoma, can aspire to such a lofty perch as the Dreadnaught.","Jenkins, Kentucky, USA","merlin48"

Grapefruit and a potpourri-like smell simply hit you in the face, repeatedly.  One of the few beers that I can still smell easily right after Ive taken a sip (for me, thats tough to do.  Anyway, the flavor has those characteristics, with a touch of salt hitting the front of the tongue, a light bread-like malt providing some upfront sweetness.  Some light roast flavors hit the sides of my mouth, but really, this is grapefruit piney hop goodness all the way.  Dry finish never leaves either.

287,"2006-08-30",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2006 Thanks to Beerdrenched for picking this beer up for me.  Pours hazy dark orange / brown with a nice white head.  Lots of floral and citric hops on the aroma that are balanced by a good amount of caramel malt.  Medium to full bodied with a good amount of soft carbonation.  Taste has an even blend of the hops and malt mentioned earlier.  The malt tasted a bit musty - could be due to age, I have no idea how long this has been sitting around.  The finish gets a bit spicer.  This was a very good beer, but I think this was a bit aged.  I will have to rerate if I get a fresh bottle.
RERATE NOTES 12/6/06 - Much fresher this time.  More of a clean hopfest on the aroma, but still has good balance considering the hops included.  Much more resiny on this sample.  Flavor starts with floral / perfume / grapefruit malt blend with good balance and none of the mustiness.  The finish has grapefruit and pine with the floral playing a supporting role.  Just a boatload of resin on the finish.  Much better fresh!!!","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Lovely pale maple blonde, and perfectly translucent.  Pretty nice head on it as well.

Wa-Zooey!  Sticky sweet hops, its like shrinking down to nanometer size and having a coamping trip on a hop bud floating on a shotglass full of honey.  It had a few alcoholic vapors that gave some fusels but without stealing the thunder of the star of the show.

Just barely enough malt to give a half second of opposition to the massive onslaught of hops.  A quick glance at the dictionnary gives the definition of Dreadnaught as a kind of battleship with really big guns.  Well, my tongue and all taste receptors therein waved the white flag of surrender, as it shriveled up and dried out.  Very long and leafy, green aftertaste.  Unbalanced?

287,"2006-08-26",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2007 I will preface this by saying it is possible that I may have drank an old bottle.  I was expecting a massive hop bomb, but what I tasted was another malty, syrupy brew that seems very overrated.

Im just too spoiled.....this did not taste very hoppy to me......Give me a Pliny over this any day...



UPDATE 1/20/07:  After trying this one now several times, I have come to realize..........This beer is very very unpredictable.   This beer must must be fresh.

Absolutely the best balanced IPA (or DIIPA) Around.  Smooth malts balance with finely hopped wonderfulness that explains why this is head and shoulders above the rest.  Very nice hop profile (Simcoe definately included, but not sure how much) that makes you want more.  Wow.  Finish and aftertaste very pleasant.

Produces a thin, 1/4"" head which fades to a thin wispy coating. Beautiful, rich, sweet fruity aromas of oranges, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, pine needles and caramel fill the nose. The hop aroma profile in this beer is simply incredible. Mouthfeel is moderately full, but silky smooth and a perfect subdued carbonation level. The flavor would in my estimation be pretty tough to surpass. Perfect balance here between the hops and malt. Starts sweet with notes of caramel candy, toasted malts, and apricot. The hops then kick in with avengence showing off flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pine resin, flowers and herbs. Finishes with a stout, assertive hop bitterness which is followed by a mild alcoholic warmth. Just a beautiful, classy brew.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Aroma is a beautiful mixture of sweet tangerine, floral hops, and grapefruit. This has to be experienced firsthand.

Boring and just like most other IIPAs. Aroma is tropical fruits, grapefruit, pine, floral, etc etc so much is here. Caramel backing is there too. Medium to heavy body with a bitter finish with a small amount of alcohol. I found the alcohol helped the bitterness and made this nearly flawless.

Big juicy american hops.  Grapefruit seeds, pine, and a big sweet light malt backbone.  Theres a little bit of soap.  Alcohol present, but not overwhelming, and actually lends something to the flavor.  Reminds me very much of Troegs Nugget Nectar.  Really one of my favorite aromas.  Light on the palate, the mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with low carbonation, a bit of syrupy thickness, and some alcohol warming, but hardly any.  The flavors are outstanding, though perhaps not as succulent as the aroma.  Big sweet malt hits me first, with a heathy bit of citrus rind bitterness and a subdued bubblegum note.  Light papaya eminates from the combo of the hops and malt.  The lingering bitterness is grapefruit seeds all the way.  Theres not a lot of complexity here, this beer is clear and to the point, not to mention delicious.  Not as big a beer as I had hoped, but very impressive never the less.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

I give it a four just because I think the color is really nice, but the rest of the appearance isnt exactly appealing.  This smells hoppy and citrusy (oranges, lemons and grapefruit), with some other fruits (like apples) coming through a bit, and a general sugary sweetness.

287,"2006-07-25",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2006 A Florida orange grove wafts into my nostrils, with a touch of flammable alcohol. The glass around the cap of this bottle broke as I opened it - never had that happen before!  Murky orange-amber beer with unusual big, clear bubbles that migrate to the rim and fade fast.  Orange-grapefruit hoppy with a unique tea note.  Extremely smooth and round, not highly bitter or hot-alcoholic, refined.   Sweet, with a few summer fruits entering the picture.  Given the ay the cap came off, the total lack of carbonation, and the apparently lesser intensity of the flavor, Im guessing this bottle was a bit abnormal and under par, but still can taste the quality of it.

Have since had this on tap in Indiana bars.  High wuality, extremely oranged, full of flavor and a very smooth palate, barely tastes like alcohol, very easygoing for a double IPA.  Quality beer.","Paleolithic, Pennsylvania, USA","xproudfoot"

A slow forming head appears as the liquid enters the drinking receptacle.  Aroma is a pine forest with an orange grove intertwined among the plants.  Nice harmony of bitter and sour aromas.  Flavor is a thick, sugary yet bitter pine with just enough grapefruit and orange to keep things flowing toward the sour side.  There is a strawberry or two in here, maybe even a bit of peach.  Palate is about as coating as it gets, and it leaves the flavors to stir on the taste buds.   Ive been wanting this one for awhile, and it certainly was worth the wait.

But after such disheartening news, the bartender told me they had it on tap.  So I got to try it for the first time ever on tap...and it was GREAT!  As soon as I arrived back home from my trip I placed an order to buy a case of the dreadnaught, and the day it showed up on my porch was like a kid in a candy store.  Sorry to fall off track but...

Huge hop aroma that is dominated by pine and citrus, but with a little floral character as well. Underneath, if you take the time you can detect some malt based aromas of light caramel. Medium full mouthfeel with a bit of a resinous quality as I would expect after being hit over the head with the hop aromas. There is a flash of malty sweetness before the hops hit, and the hit is substantial with grapefruit, pine, lemon peel, etc. The finish is long and bitter, but not overly so, at least for me. Ive been waiting to get my hands on one of these, and I wasnt disappointed.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"
287,"2006-07-14",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2008 bottle. Cloudy bright orange/red pour with a foamy white head. Swirling the snifter reveals filmy and clingy lacing. The aroma is so intense. It doesnt take much effort more than breathing near the beer to pick up deep grapefruit, bright flowers, sweet caramel. Its very complex and pleasing, like standing in an orchard. Drinking it is much less serene. Its like a punch in the mouth. The biting citrus acidity courses long after one small sip, but I mean that in the best way possible. The mouthfeel is semi-oily. Man, the hops burn the whole palate down into the throat. Im fairly certain thats not alcohol burn, but rather the sheer spiciness eminating from this hop bomb. There is indeed plenty of malt presence to balance this beast, but I would not describe this as a sweet brew. The finish finally brings out subtle notes of peaches, grapes, biscuits, but it takes some time to get there past the onslaught of zesty acidity. I drank this as a night cap and when I awoke the next morning I still had hops on my breath. This stuff is beautiful.

[May 3, 07]

 I was excited to try this one again. I have to say, it wasnt as amazing this time around. Maybe I got a bottle that wasnt as fresh. Maybe I drank this one just a little too warm. It was still delicious, but just not as ridiculous. My score reflects my first, life-changing encounter with Dreadnaught.


[May 1, 2008]

Bomber, big thanks to BossHossBikes. Man, this is an amazing double IPA. Gigantic pine, grapefruit, orange blasts my nostrils. The malts are a pathetic attempt at balance with this hop heavy beast. I get more deep citrus which even expands into some acidic territory I associate with cinnamon. This is truly an impressive IIPA. The clarity and depth are commendable. 


[May 8, 2008]

Bomber. Pours a golden hue with a fair head. The aroma is fantastic. There was a snifter of DFH 90 minute, fresh mind you, nearby so I did a little aroma comparison. Dreadnaught pwn3d. Tons of pine, grapefruit, ganja, orange, pineapple. . .the nose is very sharp, stinging, yet remarkably clean. Flavor is more of the same. Straight up hop onslaught delights my tongue with a bombardment of herbal and citrus stings. I keep wanting to describe IIPAs like this as balanced, though thats not accurate since malts are certainly secondary. Dreadnaught is one of the most solid in the style Ive sampled.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
287,"2006-07-12",4.6,"FINALLY!!  Ive been on a quest for this beer not unlike that of King Arthur and Not So Brave Sir Robins quest for the Grail.  After almost 2 years of futility, I found one lone bottle at the Foodery in Philly.  On with the review:  Mildly hazy burnt orange pour supporting a tall and rocky off-white head with a great deal of lacing.  The citrus in the aroma practically muscled its way through the bottle before I could open it!  Plenty of tangerine and grapefruit in the aroma along with a more than healthy degree of fresh hops and cut grass.  Unlike some other Impy IPAs whos flavors disappoint after big fruity aromas, this one met the challange head on.  Wonderfully fruity with more grapefruit, lightly toasted malt, huge hops and a hint of alcohol - though well cloaked.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy and the finish is sweet, bitter, long but still dry.  My expectations for this beer were probably too high but it turned out that they may not have been high enough.

Not to IIPAs, I already love the style. As a resident of San Diego, I even think I have a palate for the hops, if you will, and expect them in truckloads when it comes to a beer of this style. Yeah, yeah, there needs to be a syrupy malt tone, but the hops define the IIPA, at least around here. Yet, Dreadnaught is not of the SD mold. Rich, roasty, profound malts. Tons of hops, but not sledgehammer hops, more like constant hop caresses, like subtle reminders that you are in IIPA land. So balanced, so wonderful.

""Ive been a fan of Three Floyds since my taste buds first became acquainted with the flavor of Alpha King. Now, I am happy to have concluded a 22oz. server of another of their fine, over-the-top, wham-bam-thank-YOU, mam brews, the delicious, the delirious, the damnedfine Dreadnaught IPA. On first cracking the crown, a heavy waft of fruit invades the atmosphere, though the bottle and glass are both held at arms length. Appearance: a bright, beautiful ruby red, with a good, fluffy, creamy head. Aroma: bows to no one. Sharp pine resin, grapefruit, spruce?, tar, citrus fruit, and thats it, but thats quite an it, and ITS in full effect, yall. An invasion of flavor, an armada embarking its onslaught upon every sensory receptor open and ready to receive. Tasty fruitiness recurrs with every sip, rewarding the drinker anew, long-lasting finish, almost sticking in the throat and taking up residence permanently on the palate. Malt is nearly an even match for hops, almost, barely, but at least they provide quite sufficient ballast and body that makes this quite a drinkable brew. Fruit factor turns a trifle sweet after a time, but hop bitterness is always at hand to combat it. This would count among the list of beers to spoil myself to death with, if I were so inclined, and were capable of...Ill have another, and another, and a..whoops! too much!

Really full bodied smooth, slick, carmel, great hop blend thats really grapefruity and a little pine floral tasting with a nice but not overlydone bitter finish.

287,"2006-06-11",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2006 An exciting beer to finally behold, but it didnt knock my socks off and isnt my favorite DIPA to-date. The aroma was all grapefruits, resinous hops, and oranges. The flavor was similar, but was lacking in the malty category, which is a nice feature of other fine DIPAs. Im not an IPA fan, but I love typical DIPAs. This beer, for hopheads, is how a DIPA should theoretically taste: even more hops than an IPA without the richer maltiness (IPA to the extreme). However, I tend to like the extra maltiness of the other nice DIPAs out there, that helps balance out the hop increase. Mouthfeel wasnt as thick and syrup-like as other DIPAs. I may go buy another bottle and have at it in a year or two. Second rating, 7/3/06: A stellar experience, perhaps an extra four months of aging or my buds becoming more and more hop-preferred. Aroma was comparable as before. Flavor most notably now including more malt (along w/ full and pleasant mouthfeel), alongside a strong hop presence. How FFF packs the higher abv and malt without losing a very strong hop presence, I dont know, surely unique within the style and a fine accomlishment. Flavor this time included some honeydew melons behind the grapefruit, light pine, and other citrus notes. Mouthfeel was dead on for the style, full, and not overly sticky until it warmed and picked up some stickiness. Pretty nice stuff. It must go head to head with DFH 90 and Hercules one day.","","User37895"

This bottle was three years old and brought to me by a buddy who shone me da light.  A deep orange hue with lovely carbonation.  An austere and firm off-white heads forms and follows the beer down to the bottom.  The nose is as interesting as any Id ever had.  Candy dish, and marzipan (blood orange perhaps).  The nose is ripe with fresh hoppiness, amazing for the age of the bottle. Grapefruits,  mashmellows, and coniferous hop aromas overshadow the age of this beer. On the palate,  rich malt sweetness intertwines in a seamlessly constructed palate of wise malt fruit bosltered by a sprucy and citrusy hop spice to finish. Very floral, I cant imagine this beer upon its release.  The Abv.% is completley masked, the flavor saps  ever bit of strength the 9.5% has to offer.

With most beers, after the head dies down, the aroma does too.  Not with this one--its almost as strong two hours after pouring (yes, it took me two hours to drink this--I was watching a movie).  I am now going to give my first 10 for aroma.  However, there is some sweet light caramelish malt somewhere in the background, and doesnt seem (as far as aroma goes) that its going to be terribly bitter and nasty.

Thanks to malachi for sharing this with hezron and I.  It was a great way to cap off the night.  It assualts the nose with hops when you first sniff, but once you adjust, there is a nice combination of tulips, oranges and lemons waiting underneath.  Strong, good looking lacing comes from this as you swirl.  Suprisingly, when you take a sip the hops are well balanced.  I was expecting an attack of bitterness but instead there is a collection of tropical flavors - persimmon, passion fruit, kiwi and grapefruit.  Eventually after a short impression of sweetness, the bitterness becomes evident but not in an overpowering way.  Finally, it takes on a sweet vanilla finish before disappearing.  For a beer this big, it was suprisingly easy to drink.  If it were a few dollars less a bottle it might become a regular fixture, but at $10.99 Ill still be enjoying it occasionally.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Smells amazing. Only slightly like I expected a double IPA this big to smell, mostly sweet honey and floral hops.

And it tastes fantastic! Sweet, mellow, and slick, with just a *hint* of a citrusy hop tang at the finish. Hop flavors are present throughout, with grapefruits, pine sap, and floral tastes all the way through. However, its very subtle, and definitely compliments the malt, instead of dominating it. Stone breweries could learn a thing or two from this one.

Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and full. Almost a chewy IPA, not at all like I expected a beer this light in color to feel. Leaves a very mildly bitter aftertaste, that gives way to a sweet honey/hops combination.

287,"2006-03-06",5.0,"Bomber from Northcoast Beer and Wine , Lakewood Ohio 03/06/2006; This is easily one of the best brews (not just and IPA) I have had the pleasure of trying; Unbelievable flavor and nose from the hops yet still refreshing and balanced with that citusy palette. The alcohol is almost none existent in this one. Who says a dIPA has to burn your mouth? What are you people talking about? A GOOD ONE SHOULD BE SUBTLE WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOPS LIKE THIS GUY...

287,"2006-03-06",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2007 the pinnacle of IPAs in my experience (ive had lots but only started rating recently).  heavy mango/citrus aroma, absolutely wonderful.  looks like a dIPA is supposed to and has precisely the lighter, carbonated feel youd demand from one.  Taste changes by bottle.  Generally, this is extremely hoppy and extremely fruity.  only once was it not as good as usual.  it has since become one of the most overpriced beers available, but a top notch beer....... RERATE: finally having this for real.  i had it a half dozen times before i knew beer.  banana mango aroma, some citrus.  just as awesome smelling as i remember it.  great hop taste, pretty sweet, not very bitter.  i love it, best IIPA ever.  alcohol is not apparent at all.","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"
287,"2006-02-26",4.5,"Tap at the pub: Golden pour, decent head. Bright citrusy hop aromas. Get some malt off the start of the flavor but then bitter hops kick in on the tail end leading to a nice finish. Mostly citrusy hops, a hint of pine in there as well.

Initial flood of citrus, orange, grapefruit, mango, apricots is followed by lots of sticky sweetness, caramel, sugar, toffee. Finish is medium length with a touch of bitterness and lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Very nice beer, quite a unique taste.

287,"2006-02-18",4.5,"Bottle shared with HogTownHarry - courtesy of him. Big thanks to Harry for sharing this one - although I dont know if having it at the end of a tasting where we were already half in the bag was a great idea, as I paid for it in the morning. Ah well, it was worth it. Orange-amber colour with a small white head. Aroma is hoppy as hell, but holds some really interesting tropical fruit notes (pineapple, mango) and lots of citrus and tea. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, just luscious. Flavour - oh my lord, this is just so good - citrus, spruce, tea, wood, mild caramel and malt - I cant believe that flavours can be so big and so well balanced, and can hide the alcohol so damn well. This is a stunning beer. Thanks again, Harry!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
287,"2006-02-12",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2010 Bottle.  Poured a clean clear gold with an off-white head.  Bubbles rising throughout the glass.  The aroma is fragrantly sweet with the obvious hoppiness, as well as floral hints and pine.  The beer leaves impressive lacing.  The taste is overpowering, hop bitterness as it tingles gently on the tongue.  Orange citrus is evident along with hints of other acidic fruits, lemon and lime, pine makes itself evident in the taste as well.  The bitterness lingers pleasantly in the mouth.  

I rather enjoyed this, but preferring darker beers generally I think this is a bit too much hopping for me, though I am glad I tried this beer.

Update - 02/3/07 - More used to hops now, tried this again, and found it to be fairly consistent with what I had experienced before, maybe the aroma was not as amazing.  1 up in flavor, 1 down in aroma.  Up to 18 overall.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
287,"2006-02-09",3.6,"I will have to choose my words carefully here. While I have to admit that Dreadnaught was a decent beer,  I found it hard to believe that this was a double IPA because it just didnt have that mind-blowing tounge melting double IPA effect. It was hoppy but so are a thousand other brews. This one would never stand up against the better double IPAs of this world such as Ruination, Uberhoppy, Denogginizer, Pliny and AleSmiths IPA. How this one is rated so high is mind-boggling. I think its completely overhyped and simply not deserving. With that said, the aroma was grapefuit and pine with an emphasis on the fruit. Mouthfeel was soft but a bit sticky. Flavor was nice with a balanced malt/hop attack. I would have to say this falls somewhere between an IPA and a double IPA, like a purgatory IPA.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
287,"2006-02-07",4.6,"Bottle (650ml).  Shared with GregClow, my bottle via trade with Mullman.  *My 900th rating*  Let me start by saying this is by far the BEST IPA Ive ever had.  Poured slightly hazy orange with an average off-white head.  Aroma is a juicy hop medley, orange/lemon/pineapple - resiny but not overpowering - solid sweet lightly roast malt - incredibly balanced and blended.  Taste is just what the nose promised - juicy, subtle, balanced - theres a hint of spruce resin and the malt follows it all the way.  This has a long, smooth finish, it ends slightly bitter, but it just gets smoother the more you drink it.  This satisfied my palate in so many ways - just drink it, enjoy it and appreciate the balance and smoothness: incredible, its hoppy but it just doesnt *seem* particularly hoppy - quite an accomplishment.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

287,"2006-02-05",4.6,"Bomber. A luscious gold body with fine streaming bubbles and a medium white head. Smells intense like tangerine and grapefruit with a whiff of spicy hops. First sip is citrus. Like chewing on a grapefruit rind, but somehow its great. Bitter hops balance, but are not overpowering. Brown sugar on a grapefruit half, bread, cloves, slight alcohol in the nose, almost unoticeable in the mouth. Entire time, bitter hops balance sweet citrus. After bitter taste diminishes, a slight warming of the throat. As she warms  sweet malt, honey, and alcohol come out. Alcohol still completely subdued. Lacing reminds of waves flowing down glass. Thick palate almost sticky but still clean.  I think I am in love.... call me!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","PhysZac"

Great beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","McGrupp612"
287,"2006-01-31",4.5,"A TITANIC  hop blast. Massive citrus hop aromas, tremendous hop flavors, and mouth puckering hop bitterness. $9 a 22 oz bomber was worth the ride for me. Dreadnaught pours to a burnt orange color with a thick and creamy white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer hits you from a mile away. Very pungent, very zesty aromas of grapefruit and lemon pierce the nostrils. The palate has a good malt back bone to stand up to the hop assault, but make no mistake, this beer is all about the hop. Very good citrus/candied citrus flavors dance on the tongue. Drednaught finishes with more tangy and zesty hop flavor, then ends with a big smack of citrus hop bitterenss that tattoos the taste buds and lingers for what seems like an eternity. Hop Heads only need apply here.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
287,"2006-01-29",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2007 Absolutely huge Cascade bud pine hop aroma. one of the best smells ever in a beer, reminds me of the freshly cut tree smell on the green chain section of a lumber mill i worked at years ago.
Has a clear copper color with a light yellow head. Medium bodied and smooth. Taste starts with a nicely bittersweet hop assault on the taste buds followed by a good dose of malts which add a light caramel sweetness. But this brew is about the hops; as it warms the flowery and grapefruit hops emerge and make for a nicely bitter, crisp and clean finish.
One of the best Imperial IPAs out there.","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"

287,"2006-01-23",4.3,"Big thanks to Sliffy for this bottle.  If grapefruits grew on pine trees, they would smell like this beer.  Fantastic juicy aroma.  Doesnt entirely follow into the flavor, but close.  Touch of caramel sweetness up front, followed by enormous pine and citrus hops.  Strong smack of bitterness.  The hops dominate, just like they should in an IIPA.  Hops cover the alcohol very well.  They did a great job with this, making a beer without any flaws.  Perhaps the best IIPA available?

Its like walking through a field of simcoe hops with the fresh malty morning dew dripping from the cones. Yes, it is that good. And if you think it couldnt get better, the taste is almost exactly as you could imagine. In no other instance have I smelled a beer that so accurately represented the taste. Pungent citrusy hops explode in your mouth balanced by a caramelly sweet malty backbone. Bitterness is very clean and almost subtle for this style. 100 IBUs sounds like a lot but this beer plays it out well. Mouth feel is oily from the hoppy goodness.

Pours clear orange with a  white diminishing head.  Great aroma of toasted malt and fruity hops. This one goes beyond the typical grapefruit aroma, I pick up melon and  apricot. The flavor follows the aroma. The hop profile is bold without being overpowering. The complex fruitiness of the hop flavor balances nicely with the caramel and toasty flavors of the malt. The mouthfeel is perfect, slightly resiny. Nice crisp bitter finish. Hops really linger on this one. One of the best american imperial IPAs you can get in my opinion as far as balance. I could see some extreme hopheads not thinking this one is up to par. I love hops, but I like balance...and this one does it. I like the FRESH bottles the best. You get more complex citrus notes. Now my complaint...the price. $11.50 per bottle is a little high. I used to be able get this for $7. I will still buy this one, but less of it. If you are on a budget.

287,"2005-10-31",4.3,"22oz bottle thanks to my man Chris (Styles): Pours to a mostly clear medium amber that really glows warmly.  Theres a slight chill haze in the body with an almost nonexistent head retaining well atop the beer.  I can smell this one at arms lenght just pouring it.  At first scent its almost all pine-like hops, almost like having fresh hop cones in your glass.  As the beer warms and I spend more time with my nose over the glass hints of grapefruit, orange, pale malt, tangerine, and just the barest scent of alcohol come through.  First sip: wow, this is increadibly bitter.  The IBUs must be through the roof here (even though I know we cant taste much over 100).  My mouth almost recoils from the assault.  I should state here that normally Im not a big fan of hop-dominated beers, but this one really works.  Why?  After that first bitter attack, my taste buds give it a second go and multiple flavors emerge in my mouth: dusty light malt, ripe grapefruit, bitter orange rind, tangerine, strong pine hops, a brief hint of chamomile, flowers, and then back to grapefruit/pine hops finishing very bitter.  The finish is identical to that of biting into a grapefruit rind and having brewed a beer with grapefruit rind, I have to wonder if theyre not using some here.  The hops usage here is masterfully executed, and the reason Im able to enjoy this one is the fact that theyve used just enough malt to provide a minimal & mostly hidden sweet backbone that works in combination with subtle hints of alcohol to allow all the hop flavors to appear and re-appear to the taste buds.  Licking the lips after a few sips tastes indentical to that time you licked your finger after cleaning hop pellet gunk out of your funnel filter while transfering to the carboy.  Come on, we know you did it.  Medium-full body, mild-medium carbonation, would be sweet and syrupy without the insane amount of hops here, finishes sweet though your palate is fooled into believing its dry due to the bitterness.  Very nice.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

The mouth-watering aroma is just SO thick and pungent.  Its like a freshly sliced grapefruit amid a bed of pine needles.  Full, sticky and resiny body.  The perfect level of carbonation.  BIG on the fresh hops and enough sweet, caramelly malts to keep it from being too one-sided.  Tangy grapefruits and orange peels are in abundance throughout.  A smooth, malty middle and a piney, sticky, bitter finish that coats the tongue and lingers.  This beer manages to be both tingly and smooth at the same time.  The alcohol isnt too noticeable while drinking, but it hit me like a brick after I finished the bottle.  Just a damn good beer.  One of my favorites so far.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

287,"2005-09-27",3.7,"Served in a big Bordeaux Riedel glass. Brilliant orange-amber beer with creamy yellow-beige froth. It has the nose of a hopfield. Its like harvesting fresh hops early September. I have the impression that im smelling on a bottle with concentrated hop aroma of Jean Lenoirs Le Nez du Vin. Hops nothing but hops??? The taste has a little more to offer. It is nutty, malty and has a slight honeyish body with accents of Armagnac, angelroot, fresh chesnuts and buttercakes. Than the hop boosters are taking over again. Vegetal dominace of laurell leaf, sage, and truckloads of hops are bringing the beer a little out of balance. This is the ultimate Hop experiance but a little more beer caracter is welcome. Balance brings harmony. Huge thanks Denton (Jokes) for sending me this beer.","St Idesbald, BELGIUM","lachesis"
287,"2005-09-26",3.5,"Old gold-orange beer; orange-amber head. Nose is as plucking fresh hopcones from the vine. Pure hops - but what else? At least in the taste, theres some backing, but only just enough so one gets a fleeting moment of malt sweetness, Armagnac-like, but its quickly gone. And nothing else but hops to keep lingering. Medium bodied, dry - even the MF is overwhelmed by the hops onslaught. For the second time I taste this American icon (first time was on cask), I get the same ideas about it: this is one of the most one-dimensional beers I know. I just dont dig this. One bottle and one has enough.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

287,"2005-09-05",4.6,"No doubt an imperial IPA - lots of hops that leap from the glass to the nose  fresh grapefruit and pine. But then there is all the rest that sits on top an undercurrent of sweet malts. The flavor is filled with citrus, both the fruit and the bitter peel. Grapefruit, orange, lemon. The bitterness fills the mouth, but unlike an imperial IPA like Ruination, the malt balance reins in the hops. Great balance. One of my favorite beers to date.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"

287,"2005-09-05",4.7,"My first impression of the aroma - and this was before I even poured it - was pine needles. Once I got it in the glass and got a proper smell, I noticed more intricate notes of citrus and perhaps a bit of apricot. The color is dark amber/orange with little head and light lacing. The flavor is where this brew really sticks out - it is very complicated and well-balanced. The fruity sweetness up front is almost perfectly balanced by the bitter hop finish. Its almost like a caress followed by a slap in the face and I love it! The flavors I detect include apricot, orange, coffee, chocolate - theres a lot here. The mouthfeel is a little on the ""light"" side but makes for a nice overall package. A very fine Imperial IPA from a very fine brewery. Thanks Three Floyds!","Orland Park, Illinois, USA","lemonlovr"

Despite the overwhelming amout of hops, it does more than simply hit you over the head with hop bitterness.","Oswego, Illinois, USA","TerryR"
287,"2005-08-29",3.5,"Bomber. Pale, hazy apricot color. Short-lived frothy head collapses into a gauzy film, leaving camouflage lace patterns. Aroma seems more appropriate to a high gravity dark ale: chalk dust is foremost on the nose, accompanied by resiny pine and grapefruit, currants, bakers chocolate, anise, and ashtray. The flavor is less confused... sugar, orange peel, gin, tobacco, walnut, and graham crackers. Extreme orange soda and herbal character. Alcohol is undetectable. Sticky, syrupy palate. So extraordinarily malty sweet that perceived bitterness is actually quite low, IMO. Fruity and gently bittersweet aftertaste; grapefruit zest and gingerbread. Overrated, and closer to an American barleywine than an IIPA. Still, the overall package is delicious, greater than the sum of its parts.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"
287,"2005-08-21",4.3,"Smells of sweet candy apples and pine.  Small head foamed up and left quickly.  Not as syrupy as I thought it was going to be from the pour but still covered the palate well.  Of course, this is very hoppy and the bitterness lasts and lasts and lasts.  Between this and Great Divides Titan, Im beginning to dig on IPAs, or perhaps its the fact that the two are so over-the-top in their style.  In any case, very well done, indeed!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Fantomas23"

Aromas were herbal hops, grapefruit, lime, pineapple, some straw, alcohol and yeast.  Taste was massively bitter hops, grapefruit, subtle malt, alcohol, with notes of lemon, lime, orange, cherry, espresso, chocolate, tobacco and smoke.  Did I mention HOPS?

Nice light orange color, hazy with very little head and very little lace.  Thats a little surprising.  Malty nose with a touch of hop, but mostly sweet malt in the nose.  The hops dont really jump out in the aroma on my pour.  Taste is good.  Sweet and strong hop flavor with grapefruit, other citrus flavors and a touch of pine in there.  It finishes nice and bitter with a nice fuzz on your tongue.  Medium body, not heavy, like I sort of expected.  This is a good beer, perhaps a bit overrated or perhaps I had either an older bottle, or a newer bottle.  Solid, but not on par with Runination or Stoudts 2ipa in my opinion.","Sligo","pjk33"

287,"2005-08-07",4.2,"Bomber into stemmed glass.  Purchased at the Hyde Park Binnys, Chicago IL.  Ive had this multiple times over the course of a few years, but Ive never rated it.  Im glad that I hadnt rated it before, since I wasnt ready for it.  I remember having vaguely disfavorable impressions of the experience, but now, Im able to see why everyone thinks this is great.  Its because it is.  Golden orange in the glass with a huge ecru rocky foam head that takes a while to dissipate into an island surrounded by a light dusting and a thick ring around the outside.  Lacing is very sticky with varied bubble size, leaves a fairly thick layer on the side of the glass.  Deep racing is moderately slow, but not the most impressive Ive seen.  Smells are mostly of Cascade hops, floral and grapefruity, with some very subtle breadiness and spiciness that I cant quite describe and can barely notice.  Flavor is smooth and full of malts, showing a light breadiness in perfect proportion to the fresh, supple grapefruit.  Surprisingly, this wasnt as bitter as I expected; Id like to know the IBUs because they seem low.  For a huge IIPA, this is incredibly quaffable, and my mom, who isnt a fan of hops at all, actually kind of liked it.  I dont know if thats a recommendation or not.  The finish is sugary, almost caramelly, and the hops make the caramel notes taste delightfully burnt.  Overall, its among the giants, but Ill take Yulesmith over this any day, and probably 90 Minute too.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
287,"2005-08-06",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2005 Bottle at the Blind Pig, Champaign, IL. A friend of mine ordered this without my knowledge of what it was. I honestly thought from the nose this was Aprihop given the strong notes of apricot and hops. One taste and it was clear it was something else, and that something else was Dreadnaught. Its good to come back to this again after not having had any since last summer, although I wasnt as overwhelmed last night as I thought I might be. Maybe the ThreeFloyd over-the-top Hops technique is wearing on me. To Dreadnaughts credit, the balance of actual flavors underneath all the hops was impressive.
Sampled last night with Dogfish Head 90, Great Divide Hercules, Il Vicino Wet Mountain, and McNeils Summer IPA. To Dreadnaughts credit, it was undoubtedly one of the best of the bunch, and hence Ill modity my rating slightly.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Loads of citrusy bite with enough malt to make me think about it without distracting from the hops.  The body is deep and sweet showing off many different characteristics.

It starts out with some sweet caramel malts that soon get blasted off of the tongue by a great grapefruit hop flavor.

When looking through the tulip, it seems to magnify everything behind it.  First pour yielded a few tiny bubbles as its head, but the second pour was more foamy, bubbly and more distinct.  Aroma is full of hyper floral hops, some citric sweetness, lemon grass, honey, pine, and orange soda.  Flavor is pineapple and grapefruit.  Seems like what herbal essence shampoo would taste like it they came out with a beverage line.  Lemon grass also manifests for flavor and theres something there that reminds me of a ""woodsy"" type of cologne.  Compassionately rapes your tongue with a chafing bitterness.  Not over the top with bitterness or sweetening, but the amplified levels are quite commendable.  Well-balanced, moderate carbonation and sweet caramel contributions throughout.

287,"2005-04-25",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2005 *I obtained a fresher bottle, and as such I am rerating this beer* Thanks to BBB63 for the bottle.  Slightly hazy orange amber, small white head with little lingering.  Sweet fruity hop aroma, something like Cascade or Simcoe.  Sweet nose softly melds into a thick malt character with a bittersweet hop backbone.  The bitterness is truly actualized in the finish, when the sweet flavors ebb leaving a piney resinous bitterness.  This finish bitterness is slightly marred by the presence of diacetyl butter flavors muting the astringency.  Mouthfeel is full, and very malty.  Appropriate for the style, but too much malt presence.  I guess further East they would call this beer balanced, but I felt a lot more of the hop characters, particularly the resinous ones, should have been more in the forefront.","San Diego, California, USA","FoolishMortal"
287,"2005-04-22",4.3,"22oz bottle being enjoyed on my 37th birthday thanks to Maibockaddict. Had numerous samples on tap last year at Brewtopia 04, but was in no shape to rate it then. Clear orange/amber color with a nice off white head. Big hop(amarillo?) aroma with lots of grapefruit and pine. Flavor was more balanced than I expected. Sure there were big hop flavors, but there was also a nice malty backbone. Hardly noticed the 9.5% until the bottle was finished. Must get more of this to keep on hand.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"

287,"2005-04-14",4.0,"Pours a cloudy gold. Almost mind-blowing aroma of pine, honey, and a citric burn in the back. Not exactly what I expected from an IIPA, and the flavor was even more surprising. There is a lot of bitterness, but an almost equal amount of sweet honey. Thick, honey coating on the tongue. Maybe too much for a hophead like myself. Hops are obviously in effect in this beer, but dont have a big finish or noticable resin. Both sweet and sour are very big in this beer and balanced for a smooth feel, honey is probably the dominant flavor.","West Hollywood, California, USA","johnyvt"
287,"2005-04-08",4.2,"Big grapefruit and pine hops to begin with sweet  honey malts to follow. This beer is BIG and for an IPA is pretty thick on the palate. This is a lively beer, as carbonation continues to bubble from the glass even as it is almost empty. The hop profile of this beer isnt mouthwateringly complex, but the hop flavors that are present are seriously assertive, if not aggressive. However the malt sweetness backs it up enough to keep it in check. Dont get me wrong , this  is a great beer and any serious hophead needs to at least try this. Watch out though, this stuff is smooooth and with the alcohol as well hidden as it is it will creep on you.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"

22oz - Fresh batch - Aroma is pure freshly picked hops.  Poured a transparent brownish-orange with a small head and great lacing.  Flavor slams with fresh hops then mellows out with a malty chaser.

Smells honeyish and piney. (The fresh ones aroma was much better, in fact I sat and sniffed it for 5 minutes) Flavor is honey and piney hops. Nice mouthfeel.  Will need to do a proper re-rate. RE-RATE 4/27 Fresh? 22oz bottle from a liquor store not too far from 3F. Served at 48° in a Duvel tulip. The beers pours reddish orange with a small, off white head. The aroma is piney, herbal, citrusy, resiny hops with a backing of caramelized turbino sugar. The flavor is citrus and piney hop flavor at first mixed with a sweet, caramelly, malt backing that transitions into a pine forest dripping with sap and fallen pine needles. The bitterness starts midway, but, suprisingly, it is somewhat subdued and the beer is balanced.

Appears a crystal clear light amber with good effervescence of moderately-sized bubbles.  Flavor starts sweet, hoppy in the middle, finishes a perfect balance of the two.  The sweet flavor component is neither malty nor caramelly but just tastes clean.  The hoppy flavor component is fresh, bitter, and just plain yummy. There is also a hint of biscuit as I get further down the glass.  Palate is moderately to heavy and appropriate, though it gets a bit slick and syrupy after awhile.

Poured a clear effervescent amber with a fizzy off-white head.  Good IPA aroma of clean hops and a touch of candy with no grass.  The taste?  Well, this is interesting.  This is very, very interesting.  Not at all what I expected.  The first adjective in the commercial description is the word ""massive"".  But ""massive"" was not the first adjective that came to mind with the first sip.  Instead, something very different surfaced:  smooth.  Very, very smooth.  I taste hops, loads and loads of clean tasty hops with no grassy aftertaste... but I dont get an abrasive bitterness.  I taste alcohol, peppery refreshing alcohol, but not an overwhelming dryness.  And I taste a malt backbone, sweet and supportive, but no toffee and no stickiness.  This is not the most assertive IPA Ive had thus far.  Rather, it is the smoothest.  This is an IPA that could introduce people to the IPA.  All this coupled with a nice, full body that one would hope from a beer this hyped.  This is by all account a sipping beer, but not because its too harsh to drink in mass quantities.  This is a beer to be sipped so as to prolong the experience for as long as possible.

Aromas are a huge blast of hops, citrus (lemon and orange), sweet malty candies, and some grassy notes too. Complex! Taste is like a hops train coming straight for your mouth, and it explodes in your mouth. HUGE HOPS, bitterness, orange peel, candied malts, grainy and grassy, and a slight boozey warmth.

I couldnt have made a better choice.Impossible to find in Wisconsin, it was stumbled upon in Chicago. 10 bucks for a 22er, but with the rave reviews it had gotten, why not? WOW, the most powerfulfull blast hop aroma I have ever experienced, short of sticking my nose into a bag of hops. Lots of malt in the taste to counterbalance these hops, not quite as much as Dogfishhead 120,leading to a full rich hopaccented taste. That wonderful aroma was there the entire glass, like your drinking it in a hop field. For a hophead like me, it was the most pleasant drinking experience Ive had in years. Lucky I bought 2 bottles. Im deeply saddened at the same time that this is so inaccesible to me.

The aroma is really amazing with malts, apricot, graitfruit, caramel, citrus, hops, pine, hay, orange, pineapple.  The taste has all of this in it as well and the alcohol is balanced perfectly.  The palate is sex and that is all there is too it.  Take all the flavors and put wine in to it.  That is how I would describe the mouthfeel.  This beer defies description.  I saw this at the Foodery in Philadelphia.  If you like Double IPAs, this is one is pretty hard to top.  Three Floyds really layers this beer extremely well.  This is amazing stuff.

Pours a cloudy orange copery color with a small white head.  Faint aroma of what once was a tremendous amount of piney hops and mango.  Where did this wonderful aroma go ?  I used to crave this beer just for the aroma.  Taste is hoppy, but nowhere near the hoppiness that this beer once had.  Faint pine flavor with hints of mango and peach and caramel malt.

287,"2005-02-04",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2008 Ive been waiting for this to come around for some time.  I will take into account the price tag ($9/750ml) when rating.  The pour is perfect, copper in color with a heavy off white head.  The hop aroma is dominating - juicy grapefuit and orange mixed with fresh floral.  It goes a little deeper and actually smells somewhat like the hops cooler, older brother, Cannabis.  (Not that I would know though.)  
This is the hop-daddy.  The little bit of sweet malt presence in the start is instantly swept away in a waterwall of hop flavor that just doesnt stop.  The finish is nicely balanced with strong notes of pine and just enough bitterness to leave you wanting more.  This is alot of excitement for the taste buds all at once and probably should be enjoyed in moderation.  At $9 a bottle, this brew is still rated Excellent.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Very thick mouthfeel, much more so than I experienced with DFH 90 min or Stone Ruiniation. I’d like to do a taster of all three at the same time, but since I can’t I’ll have to say this is my favorite. If you knew how much I like the other two you’d know how much of a complement this is.

Decent sized off-white head of fine bubbles with the light carbonation.  Succulent aroma.  Not as hoppy as I though.  Some grapefruit and a bit of spruce.  Decent malt balance in the aroma  though.  Usually an imperial is dominated by hops in the nose and you can barely detect the malts.  Color is a slightly cloudy dark orange.  Wow.  Nice malt backbone.  The dominant note in this beer is the malt and not the hops.  Hops are still there but act to enhance the experience.  Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a touch of orange, butter and pine.  ALcohol presence also and warms slightly as it goes down.  Crisp and slightly bitter.  Long bitter, resinous finish.  Not as clean as some of the other IIPAs which give the brew its long finish.

Dark Orange pour.  Small white head.  Lovely, inviting balanced dose of fresh hops in aroma - cant describe how much this aroma made me want to try this beer.

July 2006. Bottle. Big citrus aroma with sweet orange and grapefruit that reminds me at times of a vidal icewine, muted malt but enough to be supportive, light spruce/pine branches. Fair bit of hoppy bitterness, light resin, sweet malty base. Medium to full body is just about perfect for the beer. Now I will stop writing and just enjoy this.

July 2004. Orange body, smallish but nice off white head. Big hoppy aroma, some orangey citrus. Vaguest hint of alcohol and some resin. Flavour is similarly very hoppy with plenty of hoppy bitterness as well. Dangerously quaffable, showing only a glimpse of the alcohol present. Very smooth, medium to full bodied palate. Leaves the tongue ravaged and spent in an oh so pleasant manner. Extremely good, to the point where I didnt take notes equal to the beer because I was busy enjoying it.

I almost catch a whiff of chocolate, with the aroma, hop aroma seems to be on the backburner, and honey really jumps out at me the most.  The aroma is pretty subtle in this brew.  Taste isnt like anything I expected.  Plenty of alcohol sweetness, and malts that almost counteract the hops.  Taste is very sweet, fruity, a hint of caramel.

287,"2004-11-26",3.0,"Feb, 2004: Bottle Conditioned. This is the last beer of a massive evening with Spiesy. We warmed up with some lesser beers before finishing with the two big beers of the night, this and Hop Rod Rye Ale. Sadly not impressed with either. Appearance of this is a slightly cloudy lightish amber with a very slight foam on top, slightly below average. The aroma is of an American Pale Ale - the sticky malt and the orange and grapefruit hinted hops rise in a pleasant, though not astounding manner. Nothing impressive so far. Mouthfeel is tingly and medium bodied - not quite as stickly as expected, though it has a tackiness that clings slightly to the mouth. Acceptable. The alcohol is well used to bring flavour and warmth. Flavour is orange flowers with a smearing of honey. There is a wow! intensity about this, and that seems the biggest asset. Impact. The flavours dont move much from front to finish, though it does linger pleasantly, shifting as it fades in the mouth - but here I am struggling to find good things about this, the 5th best beer in the world. Its nice. Its big. It has impact. It lingers nicely in the mouth. Its really not that great. MRomero again sorted this one.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Mango, pineapple, tangerine, orange, and grapefruit. Nice caramel malt background. Huge caramel malt up front, turns to blend of citrus hops, mandarin orange or tangerine.

287,"2004-11-17",4.5,"The pour leaves a cloudy, deep orange body, topped by a small white head with great lacing. Aroma of piney hops and citrus fruits. Taste is of grapefuits and oranges, intense, fresh hops, and a sweet maltiness that balances out the flavor. Mouth is big and thick and the finish is long, slow, and dry. I had waited for this one for a while and it lived up to every expectation that I could have had. Awesome.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","verymerrymonk"

Hazy orange body with sparkling carbonation and thin white head that recedes to lasting cover and thick ring. Resinous hop flavour - pine, orange, grapefruit with candy-like underlying malt sweetness. Light effervescence notable on the sides of the tongue. Very enjoyable smooth mouthfeel. Somehow this is far more balanced than I was expecting although it is indeed a ""massive American pale ale.""

287,"2004-11-07",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2006 Bright orange with a off white head. Has a hoppy citrus aroma. Dominated with strong grapefruit complimented with sweet orange and lemon aromas. Front loaded with a punch to the face in hops. The taste is sweet orange that fades to lemon, and finally a strong floral hop finish.  Good malt character hits after the initial hop punch and then fades to hops in the finish adds some balance to this brew. A very dry beer that leaves you needing another sip.

Re-rate: The bottle was a perfect 5 the aroma was huge grapefruit with orange and lemon notes. The flavor was sweet citrus hops. Everything about this last bottle was perfect.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"

Ive wanted to retry this for quite a while.  Dark gold color with no head.  Big pine and citrus hop aroma.  The hop taste is definitely screaming, but seems more diminished than the aroma.  It is also a very bruising and rough bitterness, more designed to cut up your palate than to placate it.  Better this time around for sure.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

Egajdzis was my saviour when he kindly traded this to me. Thanks a lot, friend. Is it as good as antizipated. Not quite, but its still a damned good beer. Amber/orange coloured. Light dusty. Off white huge dense head. Obviously there is a huge amount of hops in the nose with some herbal notes. Not as extreme as I thougth it would be. Flavour is very very hoppy. Has some caramel and fruity notes. Light herbal and spicy. Not a very balanced beer, but these beers seldom are. Has a killer bitterness in the end. As said this is a fine beer, but I had expected more. Thanks again, Eric.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
287,"2004-10-11",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2005 This has some guns!  Well balanced malty/hoppy aroma with molasses and pine resin.  Great appearance and taste is outstanding.  Given how big this is, I cant get over how well balanced the hopp/malt blend is.  Im relatively new to the ""imperial"" IPAs, but I think I may have found a new joy.

Rating 2004 again (1/05):  Wonderful orange color.  Sticky pine and citrus hops still dominate the aroma, but the malty backbone is easily identified.  The smell is deep and exciting.  The flavor is better than I remember (more refined, likely due to some aging?).  I detect oranges, and an entangling pine resine finish.  The body is every thing it needs to be for such a complex and strong brew.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Yummy!","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"
287,"2004-10-09",4.8,"I finally get to rate this thanks to a trade with DarkElf! Pours a beautiful clear amber with a rocky off-white head. Aroma is very hoppy/citrusy but equally malty as well. Taste has strong notes of pine, hops, caramel and citrus/grapefruit. Just perfectly balanced with the malt and hops. Pretty sweet with a very bitter aftertaste and dry finish. Mouthfeel is very full, round and creamy with subtle carbonation, just glorious on the palate. Goes down a lot smoother than other I2PAs without losing any of its balls. Great head retention and lacing hangs on the glass in sheets. Without a doubt, one of the best beers Ive ever had. Highly recommended!","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"

Smell is sweet of cereal malts with hints citrus fruit, but this is only a trap. Then the dreadnaught attacks with a hopped flavor like no other! It is a sweet candy coated hop cone in a glass. Full bodied and syrupy, sticky, leaving a thick coating on the mouth and throat.  This is hop heaven... awesome stuff!","San Diego, California, USA","Hopgeek"

It pours a rich, golden orange color with a slight head but bubbles up the sides of the glass the length of the drink.  Sweet floral aroma with a hint of the citric... grapefruit.

Brilliant orange-golden glow; light head for the style.  Aroma is a sweet hopfest of sugar coated orange and grapefruit slices dipped in pine sap.  Light hints of cotton candy and blueberry.  Body is a thick, sweet, and soft mouth full, sharply bitter.  Nice, fresh bready and sweet malts.  Big time hops make the mouth numb, the gums tingle.

The thing I like most about this marvelous beer is the thought that if this is the best, then Im not missing much.  This is great, but I cant see much, if any, jump over the other great examples of the style: Smutty Big A, GD Hercules, Stone Ruination, DFH 90min...theyre all great in their own way.  This ones mark is made by its velvet mouthfeel, but I could easily find something better in all of the other great IIPAs.  Thats not a bad thing at all.

Nice substantial appearance wtith some heft and a stately glow.  Love the hops on this beast.  Wonderful aroma, floral and hoppy as hell.  Taste is a medley of citrus fruits, mostly orange and grapefruit, but with a unique stone fruit flavor linking the two.  Also some resin and sweetly succulent malts.  Very nice balance.  Slick, full body with a stinging dirty bitter hop bite in the finish, piney with overripe orange and grapefruit pith, and somewhat dry.  Extremely smooth mouthfeel and transition from the initial taste to the finish.  Wonderfully drinkable.  Very sticky on the lips, adding to the suggestions of resin.

The trippy bottle, leads to the proper assumption - this beer is a trip.  The aroma is heavy on citrus and other light fruit, and less on the floral aspects.  The appearance is slightly dark (light/med amber) for an IPA or even a double.  Lets move on to the best part - THE FLAVOR.  Savor the Flavor.  Flava Flave in is heydey never had so much flavor.

287,"2004-05-03",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2012 2012-05-14, draught at Mikkeller Bar, Copenhagen, 9% ABV, 8-5-8-4-17=42Hazy light amber color, with giant creamy head. Very nice hop aroma, deep, fruity, lemony, but also a bit cheesy and feety; then followed by oranges and pine needles. The mouthfeel is round and soft, undercarbonated, but the body is not as thick as other IIPAs (fortunately), therefore its more drinkable; strong caramel and toffee flavor, with strong hopping; powerful bitterness, yet quite balanced, evident resins, but not lacerating.I miss some more freshness and fruitiness in the final, but its a very well constructed beer.At 50kr (8.65$) for 20cl, a couple of middle med are buying a Ferrari with this money.2004-05-14, bottle, 9.5% ABV, 9-4-8-4-16=41Copper color.

287,"2004-05-02",4.5,"Very handsome beer - tall spongy head that sticks to the sides of the glass and great shimmering copper color. Wow - what a nose! Fresh hops that still have a strong aroma through the glass. This is just an amazing nose. A little fruity malt character (grapefruit) is soon forgotten once the hops kick in.  Bright hop resolution with a lingering bitterness that  singes the sides of the mouth. I got hops out my nose on an unexpected repeat, too! Maybe too one dimensional? I dont care - I really love this kind of brew. Cheers!","GERMANY","pivo"

287,"2004-04-28",4.4,"Ive been a fan of Three Floyds since my taste buds first became acquainted with the flavor of Alpha King. Now, I am happy to have concluded a 22oz. server of another of their fine, over-the-top, wham-bam-thank-YOU, mam brews, the delicious, the delirious, the damnedfine Dreadnaught IPA.
On first cracking the crown, a heavy waft of fruit invades the atmosphere, though the bottle and glass are both held at arms length.
Appearance: a bright, beautiful ruby red, with a good, fluffy, creamy head.
Aroma: bows to no one. Sharp pine resin, grapefruit, spruce?, tar, citrus fruit, and thats it, but thats quite an it, and ITS in full effect, yall.
An invasion of flavor, an armada embarking its onslaught upon every sensory receptor open and ready to receive. Tasty fruitiness recurrs with every sip, rewarding the drinker anew, long-lasting finish, almost sticking in the throat and taking up residence permanently on the palate. Malt is nearly an even match for hops, almost, barely, but at least they provide quite sufficient ballast and body that makes this quite a drinkable brew. 
Fruit factor turns a trifle sweet after a time, but hop bitterness is always at hand to combat it. 
This would count among the list of beers to spoil myself to death with, if I were so inclined, and were capable of...Ill have another, and another, and a..whoops! too much! But, to quote Louis Jordan, ""Ill die happy!""","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
287,"2004-04-28",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2007 On tap at the brewery. The pour reveals an attractive clear golden color with a medium white head. Superb aroma of fruity hops accompanied by some sturdy malt. The flavor is amazing, the hops are strong, assertive and feel fruity (mangos, peaches, citrus), but this beer isnt just about hops, theres a sturdy malt backbone that gives balance to this gem, I like the balance in this beer and I also like that the alcohol is not present, the whole ride finishes with a strong and lasting bitterness. The body has a light to medium thickness with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. It was well worth the whole trip from Montreal to sample this amazing beer on tap, I would do it again any time.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
287,"2004-04-23",5.0,"An extra special thanks to atpayne (Adam) for this one.  Adam was good enough to trade me three different FFF styles for some quality PA and NY beers, and FFF has eclipsed Stone as my current favorite brewer.

I drank this one out of a Corsendonk tulip glass.  It pours a turbid pumpkin pie colored (I verified, from the label, that this is bottle conditioned), with a reverse ""Guinness cascade"" going on...super heady, carbonation moving from bottom to top.  Great lace.  It's funny...I just described seeing the Taj Mahal in the lace of a previous beer, and this one has a drawing of the Taj Mahal on the label!

Aroma of HUGE pineapple, grapefruit, hops, pears, applesauce, and honeydew melon.

Tastes extremely hoppy, with hints of all the above mentioned fruits, citrus, and chardonnay.

Finishes very hoppy, fruity, citrusy, crisp, smooth, with extremely well hidden alcohol (I estimated 6-7...this doesn't taste like 9.5).

Amazingly complex...each swallow brings slightly new aromas and flavors.

As it warmed, I noticed even more complex aromas and flavors.

I gave the Stoudt's IPA a 5.0, and this one is just as deserving, for slightly different reasons.  This one is hoppier, but somewhat less complex than the Stoudt's IPA, in my opinion. This one surpasses the Dogfish 90 minute IPA. I see no deductions in this one, and I want to thank atpayne again for this exceptional beer.  Three Floyds beers will bend you over the table, shove complexity and hops up your ass, and make you cry mercy.  Fucking OUTSTANDING!!!","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

287,"2004-04-19",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2008 A newer rating, spring of 08. This beer is a shadow of its previous incarnations. The primary massive tropical fruit hosp are gone as well as any malt balance. Jus tanother IIPA stuck in the crowd. New rating. This has definitely changed in character. A slightly thinner mouthfeel, a drier taste and finish. Obviously more hops than before or less malts. The sweetness that differentiated it before are gone. This is more like a standard IIPA. I hate to do it, while still excellent, this beer is not what it once was. Original rating follows. This is a sublime mixture of both bitterness and sweetness. Pours a very deep orange with lots of lacing and a medium head that fades to a sprinkling on the top. Intense aromas of pine and marmalade. There are also sweet notes of peach and honey. The flavor is at least as complex. You get an initial pine and orange peel bitterness that get countered by honey and caramel sweetness later. The bitterness stays pronounced enough to keep me wondering what is coming with each drink. Absolutely an incredible joy to partake. Wished FFF would get this out my way.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
287,"2004-04-18",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2004 Clear dark gold/orange body with a white film. Possibly the best hop aroma I've smelled. They are there, all over the place, the big juicy grapefruity hops, but they're more than that, they're a perfume, they're the pine cardboard you put on the mirror in your car, they're the orange you ate this morning, they're the lemon juice you've put over your salmon yesterday, they're your freshly cut grass on a sunny june day. Hops, all over the place and then some, and a bit of alcohol and some heavy malt. Quite complex adventure. The first sip then adds some, grass, grapefruity, but more than that. There's a mineral saltiness in there, alcohol peaks and thick malt layers, honeyish chewy malt. Texture is smooth, creamy, very thick. Definitely my favorite I2PA and it may even convince me to seek a few others out, but I'm still far from sold to the green side, the hophead clan. Worth another tribute to Raindog for providing me with this modern classic.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
287,"2004-04-18",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2007 2003 bomber.  Thanks to EddieG for this one.  Had at about 54-60 degrees in a huge snifter.  Pours a bright and rosy reddish-orange with soft copper tinges and bright fuscia hues.  Aroma is magnificently bitter.  Almost herbal and slightly minty even.  Very floral and quite intense.  It reminded me of DFH 90, but I think DFH 90 had the edge on sheer intensity.  Moderate slightly off-white head, with some medium large bubbles arising.  Ok, I cant wait any longer to try it.  SLAP!!! Im hit in the face with a bitter hops assault.  But quickly to the rescue is a ton of caramel malting to balance.  Balances out quite nicely and a full, rich, even body is discovered.  Finish is light pine hops, some more caramel malt and quite chewy.  This one was so full, powerful and intense it took me quite a while to finish.  After I was done with my food (stilton and bread and pasta), I drank this alone and it seemed even more bitter.  Now I cant take more than a small sip.  Just immensely bitter.  The most bitter beer I have had to date.  Wow.  It seems like the first half of the bottle I got all of the caramel malt flavor and the second half was all hops.  Very pleased with the immense body though. Alcohol hidden quite well.  It says bottle conditioned, but it is barely hazy, mostly clear.  I would like to see more evidence of sediment.  Traces of staleness on the very end detract, somewhat from the overall experience.  I bet this would be insanely good on draught.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
287,"2004-04-13",4.9,"hoppy smelling, wonderful looking pour- amber colored with thin white head.  taste is bitter, so bitter that it is almost unpleasent, but in a weird way it isnt.  this is the best IPA i have ever had.  this is my new favorite beer, that will be included in every order i place online.  WONDERFUL beer.  alcohol is hidden pretty well, yet it will take a while to drink this. SO good.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
287,"2004-04-12",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2005 This beer pours a glowing amber orange color with slow rising carbonation bubbles.  The aroma is wonderfully full of hops.  Grapefruit and pine hit the nose and make you realise that this beer will be a hop lovers dream.  The first taste doesnt loose a step from the aroma.  It is very well balanced.  It is very bitter and hoppy but there is just a tiny bit of  malt sweetness in the background to not let the hops dominate the beer.  The bitterness lingers and tanuts the toung making you want another sip as soon as possible.  One of my favorite beers ever.  
-An added rating- Spring 2005-
Amazing malt sweetness both in its presence and brevity at the front of the mouth.  The sweetness is quickly taken over by glorious hops throughout the mouth.  Combos of pine and pure grapefruit along with a thick tannin feel.  The finish has a quick hit of alcohol and an amazingly clean finish.  Definately the best beer Ive ever had in my mouth.  Im increasing the rating as I think the flavor is the best Ive had.","Zionsville, Indiana, USA","atpayne"

Fishinses extraordinarily strong. A winner.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

287,"2004-03-26",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2004 After much searching for a trading partner to get this elusive brew, we finally meet. The beer leaves the 22 oz. brown bomber (with a really funky label I might add) and finds itself in my imperial pint glass. The appearance is clear orange amber color with a nice white head, both pretty standard for a good IPA. The head leaves a lot quicker than a single IPA which is likely due to the high strength of the brew. Carbonation is also low and is gone rather quickly. The aroma is surprisingly mild for an imperial IPA. It is clearly hoppy, but the aroma does not hit you across the room like a Ruination or a Celebration. There are strong notes of alcohol and caramel malts on the nose as well. The taste is quite sweet with a strong peppery kick due to the hops. Smooth silky mouthfeel with a syrupy thick consistency. Strong alcohol burn detracts somewhat from drinkability. Overall I think this brew is very close to being on the fence to being a barley wine, not that there is anything wrong with that. I will try to eventually get some more to cellar to see if it ages well like a real barley wine. Too bad, it will take a quite a while to get some more in.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
287,"2004-03-18",4.3,"My first impression of this beer was its rich amber body followed by a slight amount of lacing.  The aroma was PACKED full of hops.  I expected a much more aggressive flavor but I was pleasantly surprised by a nice soft hoppy flavor.  The true hop bite was apparent in the finish - a sharp hop finish that lingers.  The alcohol content is a little obvious in the aftertaste which isnt necessarily a bad thing.  This is definitely a great IPA.  The price on this beer is bit high (the manager at the wine and beer store told me the price has gone up a dollar with each new batch).","Columbus, Ohio, USA","deadguy"
287,"2004-03-17",5.0,"Aroma is incredibly floral with hops all over. The taste begins with a bang of hoppiness but is immediately balanced by sweetness. The finish has slight notes of alcohol but still persistent hops and light malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy, very silky smooth. The drinkability is incredible but dangerous considering the ABV%.

287,"2004-03-15",4.2,"24 or 22 oz bottle. Hoppy, of course, but perhaps a bit too much fruitiness. While I liked this super-fruitiness in the smell, the taste was a bit over-whelming. Still tasty, but I wouldn't jump at drinking 24 oz at one time.","minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","IPAndy"
287,"2004-03-13",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2004 22 oz. Bottle:  Fair head with large bubbles, large bubbles throughout tulip glass as well which rise to the top rapidly.  Generous lacing, bright amber color.  Fruity, bitter flavor. The hops are not as noticiable as the alcohol, which is a slight bummer to me.

287,"2004-03-07",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2006 Average-large white head, gold/amber body. Head is there for a while. Strong flowery aroma with pine and grapefruit, something Id like put into air freshener. Taste is strong with hops, a little off balance with malt. Some grapefruit, sweet caramel, and a bitter finish that fades into a grapefruit rind taste. I detected some kind of stale bitterness in it, but it may have been the bittering hops. Very creamy texture. Overall, I love this beer. I need to do some tests with this... fresh versus ""aged"" a few months. I almost think I like it better with toned down hops, though, it does lose a bit in the aroma dept I believe.
(9 / 5 / 8 / 4 / 17)
Update 3/7/2006 - Fresh batch, I presume. This beer has lost its edge. After I had it the first time, I thought it was just a touch overrated.... but still remember it as being huge. Now, its just a big IPA. Not huge, not phenomenal, just there.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"

Sharp grapefruit and pine hops are paired with  woodsy, thick malt flavors to balance and support the bitterness.

287,"2004-02-28",3.7,"Bottled. Murky orange amber coloured beer that is bursting with complex hop aroma. Flavour is something similar to liquid hop-juice with a grapefruit bitter finish. Thick, viscous, cloying texture that can not be rushed. Drunk head to head with the Bear Republic  Hop Rod Rye, it was a battle royal. The longer we (SilkT) and I compared them the more they warmed and the more they impressed with complexity fullness.

287,"2004-02-11",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2006 Clear amber body with a generous foamy off-white head.  Leaves soapy, drippy lacing.  Grapefruit with a touch of pine and mint in the aroma.  The aroma is huge!  Im drinking this stuff pretty warm (68F), but I still dont recall many other beers that exude as many volatile odors as this one.  The flavor focuses on the bitter aspects of grapefruit, pine, caramel, and some baseline bread.  Awesome finish, has a nice malt sweetness replete with bitter hops.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  What gets me excited about this beer is the mixture of hop flavors (not just Cascade) along with malt to back it all up.  The thick mouthfeel forces you to sip and savor rather than quaff.  Points scored for having very appetizing hop burps.Why didnt I give the flavor a perfect score?  I think my bottle isnt terribly fresh, it seems like the fruity hops could have been punchier.  I found that the bitter hops dominated a bit too much, I would have liked a bit more oily fruit taste.Thoughts on bottling:1/11/05 - Definitely a green IIPA.  The hops are as huge as ever but alcohol is noticable alongside the malt, it detracts from the sweetness.  Palate changed from 5-> and Flavor from 9->8.

7//705 - choked down a bottle of the stuff.  Im in a hop-laden buzzing euphoric haze right (Led Zeppelin on the stereo, SQL in front of me); what a great beer.  Ill bump it to 4.6.

287,"2004-02-07",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2005 Been holding onto a bottle I got at the brewery for a month or so.  Finally broke down today and opened it.  Pours a golden amber.  Lots of bubbles.  Thick white head.  Gorgeous beer.  Aroma is amazing.  Hops, maltiness breaks through, rich smelling stuff.  Rich tasting too.  Whoa.  Alcohol sneaks in through the finsih, but barely.  Warming in the stomach.  This is Imperial IPA.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"
287,"2004-02-04",4.3,"Sampled February 2004Pours a hazy copper-orange color and is topped by a beige head that is middle of the road in thickness & creaminess.  Gawd-damn, intense aromas of citrus fruit waft from my glass.  Lychee, grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, hop nectar, a sweetness all are here in the nose of this beer.  The aroma is just amazing on this beer, I really don't think that the smell could get much better than this.  This beer is quite sweet in taste.  The lychee taste from the hops is quite intense & very impressive.  If there was such thing as honey made from hop nectar this beer is what that would taste like.  This beer does not seem nearly as bitter as the Alpha King from 3-Floyds, though this is probably because this beer has the body & malt backbone to back up the intense onslaught of fresh hop flavor & bitterness. This beer is certainly a sipping beer, the combination of the hop intensity and the body/ mouth feel of this beer require quite contemplation of each sip.  The fruitiness in this beer is what really sets it apart.  It is so intensely fruity & tropical that it makes me wonder if the fruitiness is not from the hops alone, and is in fact part of the yeast character.  In the end I think that 3-Floyds has just packed this puppy with fruity-citrusy hops until it is ready to burst. This is just confirmation that my first opinion of this beer was just.Sampled August, 2003Smells strongly fruity, comes at you with a right hook of lychee and grapefruit aromas.  Nice amber gold color (with golden highlights).  This beer is a very well balanced attack of American hops that hangs on a modest malt backbone.  There is lots of hop flavor in this one, with lots of fruity hoppy notes.  The taste is lightly sweet as well with a good amount of body to it.  Overall this is a very well put together beer with a wonderful balance.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
287,"2004-02-04",4.5,"Ok, this is my very first Double IPA. Orange colour with hints of orange. Big, thick longlasting white head. Heck, what an aroma... Piney, citrousy, sparkling  hops. And of course, grapefruit... I am just stunned by this aroma... Taste is just like a hop liquidid and/or light spirit. Very grapefruity and floral flavour. I can barely taste the alcohol. But it is evident in the belly.  World-class, of course. This new double IPA style really had a huge impress on me. Sooo. thanks ciderguy for this truly marvelous beer!!","Stockholm, SWEDEN","ante"

The aroma is killer:  Hops, hops, hops.  You  could even get a good whiff of them just from the open bottle.  Some pine and grapefruit notes to the aroma.  The taste is ful of hops, but the balance is superb:  they don't overwhelm you like Stone can.  There is even a hint of sweetness to the beer.  Thanks to Bert (aka slob) for the great trade.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
287,"2004-01-15",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2007 A little disappointed with this one.  The aroma is great, caramel, pine, and sugar.  The flavor is more of the same, but a little too sweet on the palate.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
287,"2004-01-11",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2005 Finally I get the 3 floyds! And it did not disappoint. Aroma is floral, sharp citrus, pine, wood, and of course fresh hops. Appearance is orange with a silky head and good lacing. The flavor is amazing. A nice hop punch but not as much as I expected. Lemons, oranges, and vanilla exist in the flavor. The citrus flavor and hops blend prefectly together. It has a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel to curb the sharp citrus and hop bite. I thought this would knock Stone IPA off my top spot for sure but thus far this is my second favorite IPA. Excellent beer! (4.8) 2004 Edition : Where did the malt go? This is not the same beer. I enjoyed it dont get me wrong but its a pine and hop fest without the balance. I liked my bottle, thanks for sending it Heemer, but I have to notch this one down now.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"

Thick, hoppy, and great lacing in the glass and in my mouth.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend doesn't really like this beer, but she is confused....she likes more of the coors original type, just kidding....I am currently in the market for a new girlfriend....someone who likes good beer, but then again, she likes this rating shit, and that is hard to find, so I guess she is a keeper.  I am getting drunk, but highly recommend this beer, it is worth flying to Munster!!!!","San Diego, California, USA","rogueman"
287,"2004-01-08",4.4,"This beer deserves all of the praise it has gotten. Pours a bright and clear orange-amber color with a medium thin and frothy off-white head. Thin and quick lacing. Heady aroma of flowery hops (duh) along with some citrus. Rich and smooth with a great hops kick that never becomes overpowering. There is enough of an undercurrent of malt to make this easily drinkable despite the abundance of hops, and that is exactly the right idea. The finish is crisp and has long, lingering hops with some spice. They don't get much better than this.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

This is a huge brew, but neither over-hoppy, nor over-malty. Cantaloupe, pecans, cherries and an overt but pleasant graininess exude from long distances from this hazy light brown beer (much lighter than I would have expected). Flavor includes hints of ashes, carrot, considerable grapefruit and finishes with only a moderate bitterness. This is an unbelievable beer, fully deserving of its reputation. Thanks Indra!","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

287,"2003-12-26",4.3,"Intense, sweet aroma - ripe fruit, herbal and fruity hops, rich malt.  Slightly hazy amber color, nice off-white head.  Huge, potent flavor, high levels of malt sweetness and hop bitterness balance each other out to create a well-balanced beer that ends up on the bitter side.  Spicy and citrusy hops come out in the flavor, but there is still enough malt backbone to support the hops.  Rich and full-bodied.  An extreme beer in an extreme beer style.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"

287,"2003-12-16",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2006 After being away from this beer for about 2 years I finally found it again.  Its still amazing.  It seemed a lot more put together.  There is still  that overwhelming mango, grapefruit, and piney aroma.  The palate was less syrupy than the last time and the malts were perfectly balanced with the amazing citrus hops.  Why is it so hard to get a hold of this beer.  Not to mention it was about twice as expensive as the last time I bought it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
287,"2003-12-09",4.7,"Nice large head with medium bubbles--laces even before the first sip.  Light brown color with tiny bit of haze.  Very hoppy nose of grapefruit.  Very drinkable.  This beer cannot be as strong in ABV as it claims--I demand to see the specific gravity readings!  Hop in the flavor everywhere, and it is well blended.  Maltiness hits you in the middle and slides off the tongue with ease into a bitter finish of citrous and pine.  Full palate that is delicious and complex.  Slight alcohol  in the aftertaste.  This beer opens clogged sinuses.  It feeds the poor.  One day it could perhaps save the world!","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","wilkie"
287,"2003-12-08",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2004 I finally made it to the brewery and picked some of this up.  It really lives up to all the hype.  The aroma is grapefruity with a touch of carmel.  Appearence is a clear to hazy, medium amber orange.  Not much head.  Mouthful is oily and coats the tongue nicely.  Taste is everything you would expect from this style.  Taste is mostly grapefruit, but has a nice tropical fruit explosion with it.  Finish is a very bitter grapefruit finish.  Better than Yulesmith?  Maybe.  Better than Exponential?  Probably not.  Next time Exponential is available, I'll compare the two.  This is well worth the 3 hour detour I took, and the risk of missing my flight at O'hare.  Ever try to pee in a bottle while driving?  That's what I had to do to get this and still make my flight.  Well worth the spillage on my pants.  Rerate:  Right when I started to pour it, I could smell the fruitiness of the hops.  I taste more sweetness to it this time.  I had Exponential the other night, and the two are different.  Exponential might be a little hoppier and less sweet.  There's something about the Exponential that when it's just about gone you're saying, ""Damn that was good"".  I still don't know which is better but damn, the Dreadnaught sure is good.  Rererate 043004:  I'm drinking my last bottle.  It's a very sad time.  One thing I suggest to people who are ready to try this is to let it warm just a little.  It brings out the fruitiness a lot more.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

Flavor is an explosion of hops.  Initially it is very sweet with loads of carmel, honey, apricot and grapefruit with a hint of alcohol.  Then the pine starts to kick in for a long bittersweet finish.  This is an excellent beer.  Big thanks to Slikwily for this one!","Apple Valley, Minnesota, USA","Nexxus"
287,"2003-12-03",2.9,"Another American IPA beaten to death with hops. I reckon this would be great if they toned the hops down a bit. Massive grapefruit, lychee and pine-citrus (pine-o-clean) flavours. Malts are smooth lightly sweet, but quickly (too quickly) hidden by the fatty hops. Tasted like deepfried hops in the end, little balance. I understand that its not really meant to be elegant or anything, but it could have done with some restraint or something. I don't even think i liked as much as the score i gave it.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
287,"2003-12-03",2.4,"ok, a tough one to put numbers on. this is for me an ambitious failure, or a failed masterpiece, the apocalypse now of beer. the amazing thing is how it gets so close to actually pulling off a balanced flavour with the sheer quantity of ingredients in there. it's almost like a conventional pilsener malt/hops balance, to the power of ªº¶£¥. the malt is clean, and smooth, slightly grainy and fresh, the hops are enormous, but i couldn't really notice the 1813746 IBU's cause the impurities of the hops all stack up, accumulate and form a giant citric/acetic/compost monster that swallows up everything in its path. nobody else seemed bothered by it, so maybe this is a beer that takes getting used to. but i still haven't really got into the whole american super-citrus high alpha stuff i guess.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
287,"2003-12-01",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2008 Big clear amber with a huge white head.  What a glorious nose full of fruit cocktail: pears, pineapple, grapes, and all other sorts of citrus fruits.  A very strong hop aroma, similar to Alpha King.  Maybe some mango and papayas in there as well.  The flavor is just as awesome as the aroma.  There is a background wood flavor and some light smoke.  Not an intensely dry palate, somewhat wet and with a thin finish.  Overall mouthfeel is just thick enough for a good IIPA in my book.  This just has an extremely fresh taste and aroma.  Very nice.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

First taste: Grapefruit/floral/Sweet/powerful - initial bombardment of my tongue. Very Interesting they master that initial kickoff everytime. I definitely like this beer better than the Alpha King. After the initial bombardment nice smooth underflavor to invite you to consume the rest. Very potent elixir too. Stronger grapefruit presense as you work your way further into the bottle. Much more prevalent and with a little bitter kick. This is the best IPA I can say I've ever had. Still like the APA's too. The only reason I'm not giving the 5.0 to this one is because Three Floyds pimped me earlier this year with running out of T-shirts and I ordered two.

Poured thick and deep amber, slightly hazy and cleared as it warmed up.  Off white head lingered and left some lacing.  The aroma is amazing, rich, heavy malts, pine and citrus hops and lots of 'em.  Flavor is about as close to heaven as I can imagine.  Really amazing combination of sweet, thick, roasted maltiness, honey, gluten, with a twist your tongue and pucker your lips hoppiness and a lingering finish that defies description.  Mouthfeel is almost syrupy, smooth and round with the right amount of carbonation.  This is my first Three Floyds and I love it.

Has lots of american hop flavor going on - very piney, lemony, and citrusy.  Alcohol hidden well but still evident.  Aroma is very floralish.

Outstanding!","Kentwood, Michigan, USA","bubslang"
287,"2003-09-21",4.8,"This is the beer I've been waiting to try for a long time.  Man o' man!  Hops are abound in this beer; and it is balanced incredibly well.  The finish is simply a work or art.  This beer doesn't fuck around, it tells you just what it is.  Believe the hype!","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","brownaler"
287,"2003-09-20",4.7,"Hey, do you like getting smacked in the face? How about by a beer? 
Ya, you do! Who's your Daddy? Dreadnaught! That's who!
To start off, how anyone can finish a entire bomber of this stuff without being smashed in the face by the massive amount of hops in this beer is beyond human. Ahhh, but it was a pure pleasure to let this beer slap me around for an hour and a half as I nursed the hell out of it. 

Color is a chill hazed peachy toned orange with a spongy frothed bone white head thats about an inch high and settles moderately down to a hazey top with some bigger bubbles that never leave the edge and the lace lays across the glass in sheets that diminish into strings and spots.

Aroma is absolutely wonderful, super fresh and floral, I'm talking right off the vine and right in your nostrils and down your throat fresh hop cones here. Big floral presense and a nice mix of pine needles and hop resin and acidic hoppyness with a smidge of grapefruit and a super fine toasty caramel malt backing. Alcohol warmth hits slowly as it warms. 

Tasting this is like liquidfied hops or something, super amounts of very floral and fresh resinated hops all up in your business. Complexing floral hops taking total control of your senses and making you recognize its presense as you prepare yourself sip after sip for the next wave. Super full of hops, almost too much, its crazy but absolutely wonderful to behold. The bitterness is quite calming actually, its just a whole lot of fresh; light pine and grapefruit rinds play along the surface with some juicy factions right away in the front, but the largely floral aspect then blooms over the palette and relinquishing it over and over as you surrender to its spellbinding hoppy hold leading through huge fields and tall vines of freshly picked hops eventually leading you back to a quick crispy little hop finish and backing up every sip is a remarkable toasty little caramel malt. Some notes of wood and earth strike the palette in some of the finish as well. Full mouthfeel throughout, each ambrosial sip and heavenly gulp is packed full of hoppy flavor and body. So much so its embarassingly hard to drink. This a big time sipper for me. Perhaps somewhere down the line in time this may become something I could get use to. This just wasn't that drinkable for me. Don't get me wrong, it was incredibly, delightfully, pleasurably, enjoyable to get pushed around by this whale of a beer.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
287,"2003-09-19",4.5,"The nose on this beer reminds of pineapple and orange zest sprinkled with pine bark. The head and lace are lasting and very visually appealing. The palate is full and silky with a wonderful intense flavor of hops. The beer is very tropical in flavor, tastes a lot like exotic fruit juices blended with Pacific Northwest hops. I find the beer to perilously drinkable for its gravity and high hopping rates. The finish maybe my favorite part of the beer, the finish lasts for a good fifteen minutes leaving me with a malty sweet citrus hop bonanza. Overall, I really like this beer because its not just straight forward hop bitterness. This has some finesse for a big beer.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"

287,"2003-09-06",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2006 Contrary to the masses I do not like this beer aged past about a 3 months. I have had 6 bottles that have aged in the range of 15 to 9 months. Aroma is plastic and light band-aids. All pleasant hop aroma is gone. The flavor is much the same. The bitter hops are still here in spades but there is no fruitiness to balance things out. Alcohol is unpleasantly harsh. Maybe ever bottle that I have ever bought has something that prevents it from aging well, but I find that unlikely. Aged Rating (3 5 4 4 8  2.4) I am convinced that a 5.0 beer is a rare find; I also think that the basis of a perfect score is based 90% on the merit of the beer and 10% on pure emotion. The first time I had this beer it was a beautiful September day, I jut finished a hard day of yard work, I had been waiting to try this beer for 2+ months. Just earlier that day I had finally gotten some of this nectar that was so highly touted on this very site. I knew from those first looks, sniffs, sips, and swallows that this was a perfect beer. Since this day I have had this beer many times and I feel that it is time to re-rate it. Re-Rate 1/21/2004  Hazy orange body. The head is mostly white and hangs on for the long-haul. The lacing is excellent. The aroma is pure and simple hop nirvana, grapefruit and citrus, there is a slight sweet malt backing, but mostly hops. The flavor is big piney hops with a very nice malt backing. The bitterness is big but this is an IIPA after all. The body is medium full and slightly syrupy. The finish is very nice, with lots of sweetness balanced by the hops. Did I mention that there are some hops in this beer? Overall it is an excellent example of the style. (Old Rating 9/6/2003 10/5/10/5/20 5.0)WOW!! This is the best beer I have yet had. Beautiful frothy tight off-white head with excellent lacing. Orange-copper color. Intense floral citrus-grapefruit aroma.   Major hop flavors but the big malty body balances things out. Alcohol is masked. This is one intense hoppy beer. The finish is major hops but the thick body sticks to your teeth. Hunt this one down and try it. If you do not like hops you will not like this beer.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

It pours with a crystal clear amber body topped by a thick off-white lasting head with good lacing.  Sweet and grapefruity hop aroma with strong piney notes and a subtle maltiness.  Slightly sweet but bitter and very hoppy flavor with grapefruit and pine notes and a touch of maltiness.  A big hoppy beer for the hop head.  The finish is bitter and piney.  Full bodied and smooth with a warmth deep down.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"
287,"2003-09-01",3.9,"Thanks for this Joe!  Looked interesting for an IPA....much more orange in color than most.  Aroma of honey and alcohol.  Sweet malts, and west coast hops came together well in this beer.  I had always heard this beer had more bwine characteristics than IPA characteristics....I got more IPA than BWine, but the malty sweetness made this beer very unique and a step above the rest.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"

287,"2003-08-31",5.0,"A perfect beer if ever there was one. I believe this is my first ""5"" beer..ever.It doesn't get any better than this, folks. 22 oz. brown bomber bottle, with some fairly strange graphics on the label. Strange, indeed. Poured out a deep orange color, with green highlights, probably due to the hops in it. Had a huge, billowing, white head at first. Then it settled down to a thick matting of lace floating on top of the beer.
Aromas are out of this world. This is what brewers dream of making. Floral hops jump out of the glass at you, clutching you by the throat. Then, the piney, resinous, and grapefruit aromas assult your olfactory glands as well. This is one monster of a beer folks.
The malts are strong enough to fend off the hops, but quickly give in, and are put asunder. The malts are sweet, caramel-ly, and lend a certain compliment to the overall experience of this beer.
It coats the tongue with hoppy goodness, and warms the belly upon impact. A literal hop bomb explodes in your gut. Thick, chewy mouthfeel, and a sweet/bitter hoppy finish make for a great beer overall. My hat's off to the 3 Floyd's Brewing Co. for coming up with this very enjoyable beer. Keep up the good work guys.","","Cobra"

287,"2003-08-18",4.2,"Medium orange color, not a whole lot in the way of head.  The aroma is concentrated hops, filled with grapefruit, peaches, spruce, and pineapple.  The flavor revolves around pineapple, along with some grapefruit and pine sap.  The malt, although not strong, is still enough to keep the hops from becoming overly brutal.  Very nicely done, with surprising complexity of flavor.  I think I prefer the Ruination overall, although this beer is probably a tad more of a subtle sledgehammer.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
287,"2003-08-16",4.6,"Pours a nice amber color, I smell pineapple, pine, sweet malt. One of the best smelling beers to me. Tastes very pineappley (is that a word?), fruity maybe tangerine and grapefruit. Finishes with a nice subdued bitterness and maltiness.

The nose is a full hop bouquet with a splash of peach or nectarine. The taste expands on the hops character. This is VERY rich. More citrus fruit on the tongue with a huge floral aftertaste. Not as bitter as I expected. Finishes with a slight hop bitterness as well. Does this live up to the hype? I think so. Is it the be all end all of IPA's?

287,"2003-08-06",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2009 Quite the impressive first impression.  The aroma is quite ardent with citrus (surprise) Mainly grapefruit.  The color is that of a fiery amber, with some clouds of head dissipating quickly.  Honestly i was expecting more all hop action at first.  But the lingering mouthfeel gratefully made up for a non-overpowering hop sensation.  Which I think is where the greatness of this beer is.  Its not gonna numb your tongue with bitterness; It has it sink in to your taste buds slowly.  One of the nicest things is that if this indeed is 9.5% ABV (Im skeptical remember) then they did a good job of hiding it....Much like SJP with the dead prostitute in our back yard.......","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

While I admit that on occasion I will seek aroma by administering it to myself via small amount placed in nasal spray, this one waltzes across the table with arm outstretched to introduce itself as a cousin of your old uncle Avery and the hog heaven where he lives. So, the hops let me understand the IPA nomenclature while the hefty malt introduces my ass to the old familiar couch. Does indeed have a dry finish, theres sweetness with the hops enticing another taste after taste until the damn thing is gone and I have to ponder the label. Its not normal. Either am I.

287,"2003-07-28",4.7,"Ok, I have to admit, all those people who have been trumpeting the praises of Three Floyds were right. This is an awesome beer. The aroma is very hoppy. It's what you'd get if you could crossbreed tangerines with a pine or a juniper plant. I'm also getting whiffs of balloon rubber, but that doesn't make any sense. The flavor is surprisingly well balanced. I was expecting some major hops bitterly unbalancing the beer, but the hops are nicely balanced by the thick almost chewy malt flavors. The perceived bitterness is surprisingly low with the actual flavors of the hops coming through. The malt is toasted buttered biscuits with a bit of caramel sauce and maybe a little maple syrup. The beer is sweet, but not cloying. The body is a dark amber topped by a nice too-dark-to-be-off-white head that isn't a permanent fixture, but not wimpy either.

Beer pours beautiful copper brown with a huge off white head that is fully retained.  There is heavy lacing.  The flavor is marvelous with an initial huge hop assault.

Thanks enormously to jcalabre for a high-end tasting session that I challenge anyone to top - we started with this wonderful IPA from a brewery normally impossible to access here in SoCal. Did not dwell on the bottle graphics, though I admit they seem sixties-inspired. This copper-colored stuff was pretty to behold, and possessed the familiar piney-citrus hops aroma of a new-world IPA. Compared to other 'big IPA's, this creation has a  balance and drinkability that is unbelievable; you would never guess the abv.

(and the slogan ""it's not normal""  doesn't seem adequate). while i'm on a rave, the 3 floyd's logo is no better:  an oozing glom of wormy fingers, it's supposed to be the hands of the floyd's coming together to hold the 3-F circle-- unfortunately they look less like hands and more like fungal growths of potted meat.  so, i give a fourth 'F' for the design, and at six bucks a bottle, this beer had better perform like the cirque de soleil or i'm gonna be cranky.  and indeed, the aroma slapped my misdirected disdain right out of the courtroom: these are mighty pine cone hops raised from birth on a steady diet of orange nectar and shots of kentucky straight bourbon; there are the caramel malts likewise nurtured like percherons on bottomless feedbags of vanilla, toasted grains and more honied-incendiary liquors.  this flavor muscles into your life, shutting off the t.v., disconnecting your phone, duct-taping your squalling progeny-- so that it's olympean greatness can be announced like a supreme-court proclamation: the dreadnaught rocks, and american juris-brewdance will never be the same.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

I am so sucker punched by these beers that provide such good flavor within their category but also so much beyond it as well. This IPA is surely hopped adequately and bitter enough, but they take a back seat as the wonderful creamy/rummy/chewy flavor and mouthfeel present themselves. A bit fruity (I mean beyond the typical IPA citrus) and slightly nutty - like hazelnut or butternut. A big, complex IPA that really sets the bar a bit higher.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

287,"2003-07-07",4.2,"Wow is this stuff thick!!!!  Orangey amber with a fine just off white head, and did I mention it pours like a fresh bottle of motor oil!  Fantastic piney and  grapefruit citrus hop aromas;  Fruity and you have to search pretty hard for malt aromas, but they are there since this is dominated by hops.  Flavor is also dominated by hops but it does have a pretty substantial malt backbone to balance.  It does also have the fruitiness from the aroma and finishes on the malty side but with hop flavor and a pleasant lingering bitterness.  Very smooth creamy mouthfeel without much of the 9% ABV showing up;  a very dangerous thing.  This is a good one!

Few other IPA's leave you with such a great aftertaste that does not sting of hops. Great beer, great IPA, wish I had another bottle!","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"

The amber color was just this side of orange. Tiny effrevenscent bubbles rise slowly from the bottom of the glass. An unbelievable piney aroma that made me want to mop my kithen floor. I can imagine a 2 story tall Juiceman Juicer at the brewery: Hops go in the top, Dreadnaught comes out the bottom.

287,"2003-07-05",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2005 I dont know if its the vintage, the difference between tap and bottle or just the extreme youth of the sample I tried at the brewery but I liked this much better last time I tried it. As it is here, its very green and aggresive lacking the subtlety of previous samples. Now theres something to be said about a beer like that but I like my brew just a touch smoother. Im still giving this very high marks by the way. I just no longer feel it is a 4.7.

A very strong flavored IPA, this beer has tons o' hops with a very sweet, malty aroma.The aftertaste of this beer was slightly sweet with a certain fruitiness that lingered for a while.

287,"2003-06-27",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2014 I think the best way to describe this wonderful brew is like the Alpha King kicked up a notch.  The appearance is not quite as lovely as the Alpha.  A fairly clear brownish gold with a large off white/tannish head and good lace.  Nose is very similar to the Alpha, though with an even more pronounced citrus hop aroma.  Very nice!  The flavor is also just exquisite.  For what is SURELY the beer I have most anticipated since becoming a ""beer geek,"" I envisioned this one as being mostly what I would call a brew of simply overpowering hops.  To be sure, the hops are FAR from understated...they are very pronounced, indeed!  However, I was very pleased by the balance of the beer, the citrus flavors, and the deep finish that seems to last a decade.  This is, truly, a superior brew, and certainly the king of IPAs.      

RE-RATE: Its been forever and a day since Ive had one of these and Im happy to come back to an old love and find it just as wonderful.  I felt my old rating was too generous on the nose (its not ""big"" enough for perfect marks), but too tough on the flavor (its hops, citrus, balanced, and subtle...subtlety alone is an incredible feat in an IIPA).  But, overall, the rating stays roughly where it was.  Still the best IPA style around, in my book.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
287,"2003-06-25",4.5,"Really good beer. I've had this three different ways:  on tap at a beer fest, on a hand pull at a great beer bar, and finally in 650 mL bottles tonight.  Great balance with sweet malty undertones.  Strong citrus hop as well, but not too bad.  Sometimes a little sweeter for an Imperial IPA than I might like (especially on hand pull) but still very above average.  I guess there is more than corn in Indiana.

Pours copper with a white head.  Flavor is powerful and sweet, characterized by grapefruit and citrus hops notes, with a strong, sweet malt background that balances any bitterness the beer possesses.  The alcohol is not as well hidden as it could be, and the IPA leaves a bitter alcohol aftertaste in the throat (reflected in the palate rating).

Given the heft if this beer and its balance, I'm surprisingly less than glowing in my overall enjoyment.  The parts are there, but lacking the synergy of a world class beer.  Its not bad by any definition of the word, and I would probably drink it often to satisfy a hop craving if it were readily available locally, but for me it is not one of the top 50 beers in the world.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

Dreadnaught is a beer Ive looked forward to sampling, since I read the first review. Also one other thing Ive noticed, on this site and others, either you love it or you dislike it intensely.

The color an unclouded copper, the head Bunyanesque in stature, spumescent in texture, the color a lovesome light tan. Ah that smell, the freshness of a Pine forest after a spring rain combined with the heady aroma of fresh picked hop flowers, the delightful sweet malt underpinnings, citrus crisp and fresh, a treat for the olfactory senses, hell a treat for the eyes also. Start is sweet to the point of distraction, the malt thick and chewy, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish pleasantly acidic, the hops ferine in their bite, bittersweet, purposeful and a very dry aftertaste, with the hops sticking to your taste buds for days, and one fine quaffing beer, my vote, I love it! As a point of interest this is certainly not a beer for the weak of palate, or those not into hops or high ABV, so my advise, leave it alone as the rest of us Hop Heads, will certainly appreciate it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

Wonderful caramel and toffee start the journey, with each step going deeper into the pine forest. Clothed in warming silk, with out a bristle to snag as the flavors unravel.  The sweetness travels well and helps cut through the twines of hops. Half way through the bottle and the aroma and alcohol are calling me to lie down for a rest on the hopsack pillows.

Different batches, different ratings, some are better than others.  It is still hard not to avoid the price increase this beer goes through each year, $4.99 in 03 to the present $11 in 06, is GWB associated with 3F?

Re-rate revisited:  This beer has been more astrigent in the bottle and tap the last year(03) than should be expected(every other sample).  None has matched, and been below, the second bottle from original purchase.  Not worth the $8/bottle.

Bottle.  A clear orange color with a medium creamy white head.  Aroma of pine is big upon opening the bottle with the typical 3F citrus hops aroma coming out when poured into the glass.  Extremely green, harsh, and raw.  It is like chewing on a pine sprig with the harshness of the hops it feels like the pine needles sticking the inside of your mouth.  A thick mouthfeel which you would expect from a 10% beer.  A bitter and overpowering aftertaste that lasted through toothpaste and mouthwash until the next morning with peanut butter being the only way to get rid of it, disgusting.  I always considered beer drinking to be an enjoyable event, you should not have to grimace and gag with every sip of beer.

I was not a big IPA fan but now I am a convert. God, let there be a Dreadnaught IPA waiting for me at the Pearly Gates (or at the firey depths). This IPA had the aroma of flowers that overwhelm the senses. At 9.5% there is still no taste of alcohol. Smooooth, with perfect maltiness and hoppy bite at the finish = POW right in the kisser!

The flavor is very malty, and lightly pungent up front. Moderately bitter on the backside. Tastes like it smells... grapefruit and pine sap.
Extremely full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel. Lively carbonation. I have no idea how these bubbles work their way up through this dense masterpiece of a brew.  Long, mostly dry, woodsy finish.

287,"2002-11-24",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2006 Sampled from cask at DL06: Pours a transparent copper bronze with a thin, airy, lightly lacing white head.  Big, fresh, and clean green piney hoppy aroma has lots of sweet caramel malty balance.  Body starts with lots of fresh piney hops and plenty of sweet, nicely-balanced caramel malt.  Very enjoyable and the cask gives it a lot of smoothness not found in the bottled or regular tap versions.

4th Re-rate 1/18/05 (latest batch): Was told the recipe had been tweaked to add even more hops and slightly lessen some of the malt.  I guess now it fits more into the style, but I miss the gritty sweetness it used to have which worked so well to balance the hops.  All I can say is that its either too fresh right now, or definitely not worth the $10/bottle theyre charging.

3rd Re-rate 7/18/04 (bottle from original bottled batch aged over a year):  The hop presence has certainly mellowed and more butterscotch is apparent.  Still plenty sweet and bitter and well balanced.  It has aged quite nicely, but now tastes more like an American strong ale than an imperial ipa.

2nd Re-rate 11/23/03 (bottle):  The first version Ive had from the bottle.  This has conditioned for about 5 months and is excellent.  Much more reminiscent of my first rating.  Lots of caramely sweetness and plenty of hop power.  A true classic!

Re-rate 4/26/03 (tap): Seems to be more bitter than I remember and lacks a lot of its malty sweetness.  A drier finish and more piney notes are present.

11/24/02 (tap): Pours a thick golden brown with a generous lacy white head.  The head even has a slighty greenish tint, due to the massive amount of hops used.  The aroma is overflowing with hops.  It doesnt even smell like beer, it just smells like a bushel of fresh hops.  The body has the mouthfeel of syrup with a plentiful amount of malty sugar.  The finish is crisp and not overly bitter, rather a smooth transition to the floral hoppy aftertaste.  It also has a warming effect due, obviously, to the higher alcohol content.

287,"2002-10-31",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2003 UPDATE 8-27-03 (bottle) - This is just the hoppyist beer I've ever tasted.  Incredible citric aroma of oranges and grapefruit.  The aroma is the closest thing to opening a fresh bag of Centennial hops that I can imagine.  Absolutely no hint of alcohol in the aroma or flavor profile.  Caramel and bready malts don't come close to battling the monster hops.  In short, sublime hop juice.  ORIGINAL:  Let me start by saying WOW!  I'll say it again in case you missed it:  WOW!  Nice crystal clear amber to bronze color.  Medium, bone-colored head left almost immediately after the vigorous pour.  The piney, earthy and grassy hop aroma just leaps out of the glass reminding me of my first homebrew session when I opened a bag of Cascade hops and drew the wonderous aroma into my nose.  First sip gives no hint of the enormous abv contained within.  Instead, you are overcome with a resiny hop blast overpowering an obviously impressive caramel malt body.  Earthy, grassy and piney flavors abound with no corresponding level of harsh bitterness in the finish.  Hop nose gives slightly to a more spicy and alcoholic nose as the beer warms.  In similar fashion, the abv rears up to show itself in the finish as the beer warms, although the malt and hops keep the beast under control.  In short, this is an incredible beer to savor and ponder.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

are you snorting that empty bottle? I have a problem. Light maplewood color, body is crystal clear. A thick and billowy amber-like head that makes a cameo appearance and exits quite fast. Ahhh the aroma. It permeated the kitchen like an approaching fog off the ocean. Plenty of pine and juniper with an oh-so-slight nose of alcohol. With the first sip the bitterness envelops your palate like a fine silk sheet. Make no mistake, this IS an enormously hoppy beer but not in the mannerism of say, a Hops Infusion. The bitterness builds like the perfect wave rather than a neanderthal-like clubbing. A flavor/palate profile full of pine, grassy/earthy textures and a nutty maltiness. 11 1/4% abv? With the first sip I pondered this question, with the last sip I found my answer. I am in awe.","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"

Quite sweet, almost candyish malt flavor, followed by an incredible amount of hops.  Super hop!! the notes say, heh.  Pineapple, citrus and other honeyed fruity flavors are HUGE.  Malt and hop flavors seem to be present in almost equal quantities, and those quantities are very substantial.  Finish and aftertaste are sweet and hoppy simultaneously.  This tastes every bit an IPA, though.  The malt flavors are nice but this doesnt have a lot of malt complexity.   One gigantic beer.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

The alcohol is not even a factor, which maybe a bad factor as the last thing I remember is having this beer, then I woke up in the back of a Jeep!  As with all of FFF the hops are there, and in a big way.  Fruit and light with grapefruit, sugar, citrus flavors.  I can't rave enough about this brewer and about this beer.

Re-rate:  This isn't so much a re-rate as an addition.  Had this cask-conditioned which considerably softened the palate as well as presented some more grapefruit flavors.  Overall, the same flavors are present, but the soft palate I felt mellowed out the beer much more and created a much more beautiful balance.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"

287,"2002-10-20",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2016 Re-rate, 2016.  Sadly I feel compelled to downgrade this.  Ive had three bottles and one draught glass over the past year, and this has either gone downhill significantly or my taste has just changed quite a bit.  While the basic aromatics and flavor profile are not changed that much, Ive noticed a rougher palate and a more obvious alcohol presence, it has become more forceful - in a negative way.  This was particularly true in the draught glass I had last week at The Rock where the alcohol tasted really raw and unpleasant at first; it improved by the finish but still was far too noticeable, and the hop profile is more aggressive and less delicate.  Id have to give the tap sample a rating around 3.8, bottled about 4.4 so Ill settle on 4.1 for the new rating.  Ill probably retry it again but Im rather ambivalent now given how much great competition it has these days.



(October 20, 2002 original rating) On tap at the Map Room in Chicago, 10/19/02; where do I start with this, except to mention that it was $3.50 for 12 oz, one of the best deals Ive ever had.  Dark amber color, slight translucence, little quick-dying head.  Aroma a powerhouse of apricots, peaches, caramel, smoke, and vanilla, I could smell it all night.  When it hits the tongue, the first thing you notice is the super-creaminess and maltiness.  This, an IPA?  But wait...fruitiness comes in quickly; its an apricot-chocolate-vanilla-caramel cream soda with 11% alcohol!  Cant remember a beer with more flavor and a more intense marriage of sweet maltiness at the front and huge hoppiness on the end; for it does become bitter, piney and wild as it goes down, and you are convinced that you have had everything a beer can offer.  Fully deserving of its top 10 status, I just hope I can have some again when I go back to Chicago in December; it might merit a perfect score. 9-4-10-5-20","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Straight from the source, 1/2 gallon growler.  Beautiful amber body, not much head (although rather substantial off the tap), but decent carbonation.  Big blast of aromatic, citrusy hops (grapefruit, pine, and my friend smells strawberry.)  Silky-smooth mouthfeel, slightly sticky.  Big hops on the palate, with a strong malt backbone just behind.  Finish tends towards dry bitterness, with a surprising burst of sugary sweetness.  Masks the alcohol impeccably well (the board at the brewery says 11% abv.)

**I have a keg of this beer and a keg has never lasted so long.  This stuff will kill ya.  I still love the flavor but there are two very bad side effects and I hope one of them doesn't continue once it's available in a bottle.
1.  Serious hangover city.  It's about the equivalent of drinking wine which should be expected with the alcohol content.  Don't drive after this beer.
2.  This beer has given me, my wife, and everyone who has drank it severe gas and usually you end up on the toilet the morning after.  This was true even this morning after one glass the night before.  I hope it's just my keg but even after a bad morning, I like the flavor so much that I go back for more.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"
287,"2002-04-29",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2003 Wonderful example of the Imperial style.  My buddies and I went to the brewery in Western Indiana and got this right off the tap into a nice big Growler.  I recommend you go visit Three Floyd's if you are in the area.  The color is amber with medium carbonation and a slight head.  Amazing Cascade aroma, very citrusy, fruity, floral.  Probably some other hops in there but I can't tell which.  The alcohol is well hidden, and the malt body balances nicely with the hops.  Very bitter, a dry mouthfeel.  A real joy to drink, but then again just about anything from  this brewery is sure to be great.  RE-RATE 4/27/03:  Went to Three Floyd's yesterday and tried on tap with CaptainCougar.  This beer now seems very over-rated.  What we sampled on tap was exceedingly bitter with little dimensionality.  Anyone can make an overly-hopped beer and I agree with some that this is not that extraordinary.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
287,"2002-03-25",5.0,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2006 One of the hugest beers to roam the Earth. Massive hops and massive malts. Everything here: grapefruits, grapefruits, grapefruits, citrus oils, mouthmenacing bitterness, chewy caramel, sweet rich pale malt fruitiness, massive hints of alcohol lurking underneath.  So damn good since day one.  Im happy that so many have now had the chance to try it. Newest editions, since late 2005, are crock full of the sickest and illest Mango flavors. This is the best on-tap beer in the World. Hand down. Nothing beats Dreadnaught. NOthing. Werd.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
287,"2001-12-15",4.5,"Fruity hops and a very sweet malty taste make this almost like a Barley Wine, IMO. The alcohol is extremely well hidden in the complexity. Have a few pints, youll know what I mean.","USA","Kodos"
287,"2001-11-21",3.8,"Had this guy off of a cask at BW3 Indy. Very sweet with a generous dose of hops to lend itself the characteristcs of an IPA. However, the sweet maltiness and the big (although well hidden) alcohol prescence bring out the imperial nature of it. An interesting beer that I greatly enjoyed.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
