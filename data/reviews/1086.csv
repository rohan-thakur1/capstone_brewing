1086,"2008-02-14",3.4,"Draught @ Gallows Bird, Espoo, Real Ale Festival 2008. Very clear, loke Sprite. Full apple/perry aroma, gooseberry. Strong. Taste very good, not too sweety, aaah.... some mint in the finish.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Tranquillity"
1086,"2008-02-02",3.1,"Cask gravity at the Tewkesbury Winter Ale Festival, 02/02/2008. A pear flavour with  some hints of apple. Fairly citric and sour. Quite dry, despite the medium label. Enjoyable, but would be more drinkable with less sourness.","Greater London, ENGLAND","dj"
1086,"2008-01-27",3.3,"Draught (Gallows Bird, Espoo, Real Ale Festival 2008)
Insipid colour. Sharp crisp estery aroma. Quite cidery. Taste is beautiful - refreshing fruity pears and apples. Toffee in there too, and a slight hint of bacon. Very easy drinking. No astringency or acidity, or even any sense of alcohol. Excellent perry. Not a beer though.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Comments: Very sharp for a perry, highly aromatic, syrupy nose with jammy undertones. Beyond the usual juiciness despite being quite sweet. One of my favourite perries and probably my favourite sweetish one.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
