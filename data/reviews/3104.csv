What a great beer, truly. Equal parts Schlenkerla Maerzen and Blackberry Farm Classic (though drier than the latter, which can sometimes be a touch too sweet for my tastes), but almost certainly better than a simple blend of the two (never tried it myself, but probably should!). Complex and extremely enticing/evocative nose that neither skimps on the smoke nor overdoes it...its more smoky perhaps than any other American smoked beer Ive had (quite nearly as strong as Schlenkerla itself), and yet still allows wonderfully rustic saison characters to shine through, which is quite a feat.

I can immediately smell this one as soon as I pull the cork, but then pouring it into a tulip glass nearly makes me weep tears of joy. The smoke is so deep, genuine and meaty it gives the impression of smoked pork fat sort of like Schlenkerlas beers. Ive tried making a hickory smoked beer in the past and always thought that should be more of a thing. These guys just knocked it out of the park. The palate is damn creamy. A suggestion of pineapple starts to come through, making this seem like a glazed, smoked ham. The finish is nothing short of endless and chewy with deep, true, hearty smoke. Despite the powerful and authentic hickory smoke, this still has a complex bouquet of spicy, fruity esters. Were talking best beer of the year for me.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Looks and drinks like a quality Saison, but tastes and smells like its been hit over the head with a smoked sledgehammer. Some people will want to pair this with pulled pork BBQ or a smoked turkey leg, but that would just be redundant.","","Beer4Blood"
3104,"2016-07-10",4.4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours hazy golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of huge wood smoke, bacon, peppercorn, lemon, pear, apple, apricot, white grape, hay, straw, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, smoke, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge wood smoke, bacon, peppercorn, lemon, pear, apple, apricot, white grape, hay, straw, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of wood smoke, bacon, peppercorn, lemon, pear, apple, hay, straw, wheat, cracker, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, smoke, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, dry, and lightly creamy/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.3%. Overall this is an amazing smoked saison! All around Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, smoke, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3104,"2016-07-04",4.4,"Pours a hazy orange gold color with a good large white bubbly head. Aroma is intense but light, lots of smoke, almost iodine, hay, grass, underlying chewy apricot, a faint peach sweetness, some fruity medicine-like warm booze on the end along with a medium floral hop. Taste is wonderful, tons upon tons of grain and cereal with a weaker smoke than the nose but still very present, not a lot of fruit comes forward like in the nose either but if I had to place it I would say firm peaches, barnyard and hay without funk, too much else going on to taste the lighter grassy notes. This is a magnificent beer, I will forever be chasing the hay and grain flavor from this and likely never find it so clean and well balanced.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","BadAprilia1000"
3104,"2016-06-04",4.3,"Hazed golden orange. Thick white head slowly fragments. Expressively aromatic, with smoked hay, airy phenols, iodine, sugar cookie, flower nectar, peppery hops and a hint of lilac and Dupontlike sulfur. Plentiful carbonation is slightly prickly. Oily notes of iodine beautifully contrast with lush, mouth-filling hay and slashing phenols. Sumptuous waves of hop oils permeate the palate with a marmalade-like suppleness, as they release tight pockets which brightly sizzle before bursting, slathering the malt with an array of vibrant hop flavor. Refined pils malt yields a multitude of hay dust which spreads itself gracefully across the tongue. Exceptional balance despite the very deep, unremitting rauch character. Meatlike qualities are nonexistent, as the masterfully extracted malt is all about boasting its multilayered new-mown hay and smoked baguette richness laced with plenty of fluffy smoke. Such exquisite malt softness causes the lips to smack, as does the elegant lemon and floral medley. Some firmer sugar cookie edges in there as well, which bolster the seemingly boundless malt complexity. Dusty yeast and enlivening hints of pepper exude from front to back, adding the obligatory sass to temper the resonant maltiness. Ongoing iodine-tinged smoke and a cushion of luxuriant hay cradles the assortment of hop spice and bright nectar in the well attenuated finish. Soft smokiness perpetually lingers. Simply a stupendous concoction, and probably the most singular saison Ive tried to date. Its unapologetically smoky (rivaling anything from Franconia, in fact), yet the saisons soul has not been compromised even slightly. Outstanding.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3104,"2016-06-01",4.1,"750 ml. Foggy, orange-golden body has a small covering of loose foam. Nose is smoked meat with some earthy honeycomb and a hint of funky cheese. Flavor is charred wood and smoke with some white grape, and touches of lemon juice and mild funk. Long finish has smoky peach bubblegum. Near-medium body has a nice balance and a little too much fizz for me. As with Bentons bacon, this brew is pedal-to-the-metal smoked. This is a great smoked and the beer underneath is also quality, but it needs some darker malt to stand up against the Benton smoke onslaught to be a top 5 smoked brew.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
