Deeper tones of raisins and dried apricots add to the soft sweetness of the nose. The flavor is a wave of rye bread  soft, with an unexpected dry grainy quality that marries well the caramelly texture and aftertaste. Harmonious but somewhat monotone, lacking intricacies or a counterbalance. Some banana, dried pear provide interesting undertones. Fluffy, drinkable texture but lacks length on the aftertaste.

755,"2017-02-22",4.0,"Ar: Banana and peach, bright and fresh, a bit underripe; doughy bread, lemon notes, and hints of bubblegum and black pepper.

P: Medium-full body with high carbonation, but crisp impression; finish is dry. O: This beer is a joy to drink; the dense banana flavor is balanced beautifully with a full array of esters, malt notes, and spices; the sugary, slightly molasses, quality brings this into dunkelweizen territory, though it is on the lighter, brighter side for the style--but, delicious nonetheless!","Plainfield, Vermont, USA","Jabic"

755,"2015-01-02",4.4,"Ayinger Ur-Weisse (DE) - Dunkelweizen - 5.8% - 4.4/5
On tap at Ayinger Braustuberl, Aying, august 2014. (also bottled, right now)
Dark orange to hazelnut color, obviously cloudy, enormous white head, magnificent. Not dark as other dunklers. 
Quite perfumed, not excessively though.
Intense weizen aroma (wheat), sugary malts, fuity and spicy. Banana, peach, yellow fruits with hints of lemon. Doughy yeast, yet not too invading. Alcohol reminded me of whiteboard marker, thus bottled i didnt find this. Some grassy hops comes to say hello thru the finish.
Articulated fruity taste, sweetish, slightly sour, full bodied, long finish with an amaretto/almond thing, very tasty. Proper carbonation, dusty to creamy texture, very fluffy. Excellent. WOW, the finish is just superb, sticky, ultra-umami.
Also bottled after 5 months doesnt lose its freshness. Probably this is THE dunkelweizen, either not really dunkel, its a powered up weizen, simple, classic, elegant. A whoppy 4.4 for a classic non-experimental beer? Well, yes. Pick your bags, go to Aying on a nice summer day, sit at their stube and have one of this. You wont be in need for any Double IPA, Quadrupel or whathever. Just enjoy.","ITALY","JaKeAFC"

The aroma is not like a typical hefe: yeast softness; dark, pungent fruits; an herbal spiciness, not unlike cloves. Orange zest with a prickly spice. Hint of green apple and red apple skins too.

The flavor is mashed plums, cinnamon on apple sauce. Bread dough. A definite basement funk to the flavor. Touch of apricot, but not the cloying, sugary kind I hate in beers.

Feels juicy and slick on the palate. This is a crowd-pleaser: lots of darkish flavors, but nothing burnt. Lots of sweetish flavors, but nothing saccharine. Beautifully balanced for a very cold autumn evening.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

755,"2014-07-30",4.2,"Poured from bottle into a weizen glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a hazy deep amber color with a huge thick and creamy just off-white head. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading to leave a fantastic level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. This is a beautiful weiss in my eyes.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is huge of banana and wheat along with tons of spice of a coriander and clove smell. Other aromas of a white pepper and a decently strong aroma of a bubblegum as well as a bit of an orange and ginger smell are there as well. Overall the aroma is a big, robust, and enjoyable in this one.
 Taste  The taste begins moderately sweet and malty, with the malty flavors being a nice mix of a bready and doughty taste while the sweet upfront is largely of an orange and caramel flavor. As the taste advances the sweet caramel transitions to a nice bubblegum and candied sugar flavor with the doughty flavors getting a bit more potent in nature. All while this occurs the yeasty flavors and bring with them flavors of banana, coriander and clove. The yeasty and coriander flavors remain relatively constant from this time on, but the banana and clove really kicks it up more toward the end. With the increase in banana, also comes some other flavors of candied sugar as well as little bit of pepper, which when combined with all the other flavors of the brew, end up leaving a rather nice and somewhat moderately sweet Weiss flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner side for a beer of 5.8 % of its style s with a carbonation level that is on the lower side for the style. A little thicker and chewier body and a bit more carbonation level may have been better for accentuating the fruity banana and spiced flavors as well as the more malty flavors of the brew, but even with that said, the combo did work to a degree and the feel was decent overall.
 Overall  This is a very tasty weizen. The aroma, look, and taste are quite fantastic, with the only thing keeping this from the supreme top being the feel in my opinion. This is one you certainly can count on to being rather pleasant.","","Darkmagus82"

Cloudy hazy mud brown colour with lots of trunky, dirt-like yeast sediments; Explosive three finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasted for 2 minutes; Moderate sticky lacing and quite fizzy carbonation; Very fragment aroma of wheat malt, with fresh banana, vanilla, caramel, toffee, light apple fresh, sugar, bubblegum, light cloves, malt, strong yeast and shades of grass; Close to light sweet taste of roasted malt, with light nuts, banana, fresh toast, caramel, toffee, light tart notes, light cloves, spices, strong yeast, lemon and light bitter hops and thin grass; Close to light body. Smooth and quite rich palate; Mouth feel is smooth and wholesome dark maltyness, roasty and slightly nutty, whereas wheaty tartness is much lighter than Bräu Weisse; Strong caramel with fresh toast, fleshy banana and apple ester is prominent, light cloves and spices, tasty indeed!... Hoppiness is light grass in nose, lemon and thin grass and taste. Bitterness is low but notable for a roasty, wheaty faint astringent finish; Quite dry after taste, very easy and quite wholesome to mouth.

Comments: Like the Bräu Weisse, this one impresses with fragrant fruity aroma, wholesome maltyness, and a smooth-as-ever pretty rich taste. A really close match with Neumarkter Lammsbräus Schwarze Dunkles Hefeweizen, but it lacks the smoky, nice chocolate and toffee palate of the latter. Still, it does not lessen its greatness a least bit. Way better than the Bräu Weisse and a convincing top dark wheat beer. Very nice!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

755,"2014-06-29",3.6,"I poured this into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a fairly light glossy slightly golden bronzed amber of sorts with a fairly decently two finger white foamy head that dissipates within about less than a minute. Theres barely any lacing.
The smell makes up for the appearance since it just didnt seem just quite dark enough for a dunkelweizen, anyways, heres what I got, a nice banana estery clove-like goodness gently gracing itself into a fairly sweet German maltiness, very nice.
The taste takes the previously mentioned flavors to town and just makes a nice sweet sticky banana-like aftertaste to coat the finish and leave it somewhat dry.
On the palate, this one sits right at a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability running about it.
Overall, other than the look, it smells, tastes and has a great mouthfeel, I say if you see this dont pass up on it even though it doesnt seem quite as dark as most dunkelweizens Ive had.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Pretty much tastes as it smells: a really great example of the German weissbier style. I think it tastes more like a weissbier than a dunkelweiss. My only knock on this beer is the effervescence.

755,"2013-09-29",4.0,"Pours murky and turbid. Light brownish amber with gold hues around the edges and plenty of bubbles streaming up towards the mammoth creamy head of off white foam. That head sits atop this beer like its gonna last forever. Leaves wet lace, refreshes as it drinks, and never falls off completely. Nice layer on top throughout the drink. 

Nose is soft fruits. Light banana and a nice bit of clove. Some tart apple to perk it up and a good bread malt underneath it all. Taste follows the nose all the way. Soft and demure but with a little bit of moxy behind it too. Perky carbonation and a bread that is stronger in the drink than on the nose. Smooth banana and spicy clove combine with the tart apple for a heavenly, creamy drink with just the right amount of tartness. The finish lasts and is dry and has a bit of wheat to really accent all those flavors. Tiny bit peppery at the end but that too is soft and gentle. 

The flavors on this one arent sharp but the drink moves nicely over the palate with a gentle mouthfeel that highlights the tart apple so well. The malt in this just keeps bringing bread to the palate and I really like that. It is medium bodied, tasty and very refreshing.","New York, USA","pinkie"

755,"2012-06-27",3.6,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a wheat beer glass.

Appearance: Lighter than most dunkelweizens - a dirty/rusty orange/light brown hue. Not completely opaque because I can see a lot of fine carbonation racing towards the top. Forms a huge, off white, foamy head which mostly dissipates and leaves some lacing on the glass.

Smell: Definite banana scent from the yeast and a hint of apple cider (not sure if thats a good thing or bad).

Taste: I often wonder how Germany has more than one brewery since the staple styles from the staple breweries all taste more or less the same to me. Ayinger Ur-Weisse tastes very similar to other authentic wheat beers from Germany. Thats not a compliment or a slight - just an observation. Sweet banana flavor up front, but mild - even borderline watery. A hint of bitterness through the middle followed by some more subtle spice notes. Reminiscent of apple cider (the kind kids drink, not the hard stuff), maybe even banana bread. Clove? Sure, but thats also mild. I even get a hint of sourness or tartness, although it actually works well with the cider-like qualities of this palate. 

Since theres no discernible freshness date on the bottle, Im going to have to assume my bottle of was slightly old. Usually, beers of this style are much more complex and bold, but this seems more mild than it should be. But it still remains a satisfying, delectable beer regardless.

Drinkability: Ive yet to find a wheat beer thats difficult to drink, so calling this beer highly drinkable is stating the obvious. The mouthfeel is akin to finely carbonated water and the aftertaste is clean. Its absolutely refreshing on a hot day (or night). Im actually surprised its 5.8% ABV, which isnt all that big, but seems rather high for such an otherwise mild palate. No one will have any trouble getting through a bottle of this.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

755,"2012-04-09",4.0,"Poured into a yardstick glass.

A: Due to the way I poured it into the said glass (read: as aggressively as possible), it came out with one of the biggest damn heads Ive ever seen. Forget measuring it in fingers, this thing would have had to been measured in FEET. And it was beautiful to boot. Frustratingly, the head retention is excellent. The body itself is a very cloudy, murky dark copper color that looks vibrant.

S: Apple, banana, cloves, and that trademark ""bubblegum"" smell dominate the nose. Smells a bit tangy, as well. Nice!

T: Very refreshing stuff. The typical wheat beer esters are there in full force (bubblegum, banana, cloves), but it also has a tangy apple quality that mixes beautifully with the other flavors. I have to say that I slightly prefer the flavor profile of a hefeweizen, but I can really taste the top-notch quality in this.

M: Nice smoothness, with refreshing carbonation. The feel of the beer doesnt stand out, but holy shit, is it easy drinking.

O: Like I said, if given a choice between a hefe and a dunkel, Ill probably take a hefe. But this is nonetheless an excellent beer. If youve never had the style before, this is a great place to start.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Aromas of rising dough and freshly baked whole-wheat bread, caramel, clove, banana, slight citrus, some refined German hops. Flavors of pale malt, mellow wheat, tart citrus, tangy hops bitterness, fruity and spicy fermentation. Lasting sweet & sour finish.

755,"2012-01-08",3.6,"Pours a decidedly lighter color than the standard dunkel weisse;  the color is a deep hazy orange and the head is of course enormous, tight, white, and reminiscent to the top of a meringue pie.  

The aroma is yeasty from the get go, with a lot of raw malt, and general ""brewery tour"" aromas. Some spiciness and banana show up in the aroma but its mostly just a lot of grain and yeast, but not in a negative way/

The flavor is more complex, certainly there is some defined maltiness to the beer but its got a well rounded fruitiness with about as much ripe red apple as banana, a fairly restrained spiciness (to style), and a nice bitter zing throughout. The beer is sweet but not overbearing.

755,"2011-09-22",4.2,"500ml bottle - $3.29 at Total Wine & More in Alpharetta, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a clouded, dirtied tan body with a near-white, expansive head.

Smell: Fruity, malty nose with some traces of honey on morningtime wheat toast, a dusty yeastiness, and popped clove buds.

Taste: Faintly tangy wheat malt at the start, a moderately sweet inclusion of both wildflower honey and light-colored caramel before some fruity tastes of Gala apples, bananas, and pears. Very low, fairly brief tartness present. Light clove accent (certainly less than was present in the aroma). Very subdued bitterness. Soft but also a bit of carbonated crispness on the sweetish, lightly fruity finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Fairly smooth on the tongue.

Overall: Quite pleasant and quaffable, one of those moreish beers where you clear through the entire bottle pretty quickly. This just might beat out Weihenstephaners dunkelweizen for me.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
755,"2011-09-20",3.8,"500ml bottle.

Pours a murky brownish amber with a big creamy beige head that recedes very slowly to a thick cap of foam, leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma is sweet with lots of wheat presence but with plenty of dark malts as well.  There are other sweet fruit notes with apples and pears and a healthy dose of cloves and even some citrus.

Taste is honey-coated bananas with dark roasted malts.  It still tastes mostly like an amped up hefe with the yeast dominating though the malts add a nice layer underneath.  The finish has a nice mellow spiciness.

The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, very active on the palate, almost too active but its OK since the body is pretty meaty for the style.

Cloves, banana and wheat along with a little spiciness & some bubble gum. Faint coriander in the background too.

A caramel brown colour, cloudy & forms a 2-finger sized foamy head with good retention.

Lots of banana quickly followed up by mild citrus flavours, a hard to detect toffee flavour and a nice spicy clove taste.

Medium bodied with a refreshing feel to it & a smooth texture overall. Goes down great & even though the carbonation is high the beer isnt gassy.

Excellent tasting & well balanced that goes down a treat. The colour isnt as dark as I remember from previous dunkelweizens I have tried but that isnt necessarily a bad thing as this one still looks (and tastes) fantastic.

It pours a darker hefeweizen color, not quite as dark as a typical dunkelweizen, it is a ur-weisse (traditional/pre-modern weisse) after all. It is cloudy with a foamy, creamy-looking off-white head.

The smell is dominated by bananas with just a hint of clove and wheat.

The flavor continues the banana theme. This is just a banana bomb and then some. There is some clove , some apple, and some lemon, yes but the dominant yeast flavor here is banana. There isnt much in the way of roasted malt in the taste. There is a slight bit of hops that round it out.

755,"2011-04-22",2.7,"Picked up a bottle at Chevy Chase in DC. Served in a weizen glass.

Pours a moderately-dark golden-bronze color with a thin white head that recedes somewhat quickly and doesnt leave behind much other than a bit of spotty lacing. Almost no haze. The nose is pretty weak with a bit of sweetened malt and clove. A touch of banana there as well. Taste is quite plain as well. Theres just not much coming from the malt or the yeast. Mouthfeel is a bit light and undercarbonated, though its smooth. Drinkability is decent enough, though theres really nothing all that special about this beer.

P:  Fizzy, chewy hefe body.

T: A big blast of banana and clove flavors to begin. Fairly sweet with a surprisingly prominent level of floral hoppiness. A subtle to moderate bitterness and some light citrus. Not quite as bready and hearty as I had hoped for.

M: The body is medium with a pretty high level of carbonation that gives a slightly creamy feel.

755,"2010-12-06",4.0,"Appearance: bready orange with a tinge of amber here and there. Fluffy white head, slightly off-color, fades slowly into a thick blanket. Haze throughout her whole body thanks in all parts to her unfiltered darker wheat delights. Swirls with small bits of lace.

Nose: honey whole grains; touch of weight much like honey whole grain bagels and loaves. Almond nuttiness. Hint of greenness with banana peels before giving way to fresh moist banana bran muffins.

Palate: full, chewy, and bready with a medium weight. Sweetness of ripe bananas and honey underneath while her top is bright with green banana peels. Dry roasted whole almonds for a subtle pervasive nuttiness. Honey kisses whole grains while bran muffins enjoy a generous drizzle of that sweet sticky nectar of the bees for a continual chewy and moist mouthfeel and body. Almost non-existent presence of cloves; faint and flickering. Green bananas linger in the finish with more ripe bananas settling in the back of each swallow.

Final Thoughts: Ive had many a dunkel Weisse of heavier darker designs, and yet there is something about the Ayinger Ur-Weisse which oozes class and timeless sophistication.

The nose brings moderate notes of banana esters, and a lighter touch of clove and some other spices, along with an underlying hint of Munich malt.  The palate begins estery, but in a manner that is far more refined than other examples of the style.  Again, banana is the main flavor, followed by a nice malt character, and some spice.  Hops are not apparent in any aspect.  The carbonation is a little bit lighter than I anticipated, but pairs nicely with the beers other characteristics.  The finish is moderately estery and moderately sweet.  Overall, a great example of an oft-flawed style.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

This is a very good wheat beer and one of the few that I would put up with Weihenstephans lineup.

Good looking beer with an orange-brown body and a big, creamy, ecru head.  Its entirely hazy.  The aroma is banana bread with some fairly mild spice.  It definitely tends toward slightly toastier/breadier flavors than the hefe, though I might not have noticed that if I hadnt had the hefe so recently.  The taste is sweet and fairly full.  Carbonation is appropriate for the style, though, perhaps, on the softer side.  Sweet wheat flavor is plentiful, but its a bit toned down.

755,"2008-08-18",3.6,"500mL bottle purchased for $3.30 - I think it was from Wine Emporium in Boston.  Freshness unknown.  An interesting pour into a weisse glass.  Started off light, getting much darker as the bottom of the bottle was poured in.  Although I swished the end of the bottle lots to shake up the sediment, there were still numerous chunks in the glass... so I stirred it with a spoon!  My first time ever doing that.  The end product is a cloudy grey-gold.  Medium aroma of a typical weisse - yeast, banana and bubblegum.  Taste is solid.  Quite yeasty, which gives it a bit more of a spicy character perhaps than some other weisses.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","sstackho"

755,"2008-08-16",3.6,"(bottle) Pours hazy light brown with a voluminous white head.  Aroma of toasted grain, light bubblegum, wheat, and banana.  Some bread appears as well.  This aroma tends to veer more towards weizenbock territory, although it is far less potent but still nice to smell.  Taste is lightly roasted initially, with a nice mid-palate of caramel and plum that yields to a crisp wheat finish that erases all of the sweetness which was originally present.  The mouthfeel is medium.  This is a very solid beer that doesn’t overly impress, yet doesn’t disappoint either.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

755,"2008-02-25",3.5,"A standard pour produces an easily four-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a full amber color and shows a deeply hazy, pinkish, light amber color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite fruity with notes of ripe plums, apples and juicy-fruit gum all quite noticeable. Spice notes of clove and banana traditionally found in the style are also evident.  Dusty grain aromatics, some tart wheat character and a freshly crushed malt character in the finish add the malt component of this beers nose.  As the beer warms a bit the fresh, vibrant fruitiness begins to pick up a slightly green, under-ripe edge.

Lightly sweet tasting up front and through the middle, though the flavor does dry out some towards the finish.  This is a light, easy drinking beer for the most part, but it has a touch of creamy heft (despite an zesty carbonation) and fullness to it.  The carbonation seems to help keep this beer seeming light and quaffable.  Lightly tart notes characteristic of wheat accents flavors of sour / sweet plums, light apple flavors and a touch of tamarind.  A bit of dusty grain towards the end as well as some light grassy grain and at times a stale cracker flavor in the finish.  The more traditional Hefe-flavors of clove and banana are here, but seem to play a supporting role; that is not to say this does not taste quite traditional as even the other flavors that are here are perfectly in line with the style.

Refreshingly tart, yet with a fullness that makes it seem perfectly appropriate for a warm, Tucson winters afternoon.  A tasty beer that is perhaps a touch flawed, but still quite good.

755,"2008-02-22",3.5,"Pours alightly cloudy llighter honey color with a nice active white head. Banana, clove, and bubblegum dominate the nose with a bit of peppery spice as well. Uniquely ripe banana flavor with less sweetness than expected, which is very nice. Reminds me of banana pudding. Vert creamy mouthfeel with some pepper on the finish. There are also some roasty caramel notes, maybe apple and grape as well, very subdued though. I am really enjoying the toned down sweetness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Davinci"

Taste of this medium bodied brew is the same with a champagne dryness(like their hefe). Not a bad brew but the weizen characteristics are not really pronounced. Still tasty.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Headbanger"
755,"2008-01-03",4.0,"Huge nice off white head. Excellent retention. Had to wait a while for the head to die down enough for me to swirl & pour the last inch of the beer. Very cloudy. Orange/brown. Aroma: banana & some strawberry. Taste: More of the same, strawberry is stronger though. Am I the only one seeing strawberry here? Tastes very good, finish is a bit lackluster with an odd bitterness that doesnt fit as well with the rest of the beer. Mouthfeel is perfect for this kind of beer. Carbonation feels light, as I usually like it. Reminds me a lot of a less intense Aventinus Doppelbock, but tastier since I prefer strawberry-banana smoothies, er I mean beers, to straight banana ones.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"

Robust, fresh, nutty taste - I love this flavor which is unique to hefeweizen - a mixture of wheat and a certain type of yeast, perhaps?  Notes of citrus and clove.

Aroma is a little banana with citrus and cider. Taste is similar with even less banana, and more peppery, maybe from the high levels of carbonation (not a complaint; the high CO2 level is not overdone, and is nice in this beer). Very thirst quenching, goes down easy and has a smooth palate. Not real heavy; could definitely be a real nice session brew. Unlike some of the other dunkelweizens I have had, swirling the yeast sediment around and pouring it in the glass seems to actually diminish the banana/clove taste and aroma that I like in this kind of beer.

Nose is midly sweet with wheat and just a slight hint of bananas.

Flavor is almost like fresh banana bread made with wheat. Wheat has some real heft to it that just wraps around the palate. Lots of bananas and some slight hints of cloves. Little bits of orange and lemon, but just a light lisp off the tongues worth. Even can pick out some slight yeast juicness.

By titling the glass, I cause finely-beaded lace to hover hestitantly and then retreat with the lethargy of a deflating blimp. Inhaling sets the sinuses aswirl with a Belgian-ish bouquet of phenolic spice, yeast, honeydew, and pistachio. Second pour, with lees, produces even aromatics; and almost barnyard tang, tempered by gardenia and marigold musk. Rich and spicy flavors abound with honeyed sweetness, bread dough, pine nuts, black pepper, and ripe orchard fruits. Citric tartness and prickly carbonation relieve the creamy, Rubenesque mouthfeel.

There is also some bready yeast, some sweet malts and honey, and traces of lemon or sweet orange zest and banana. The beer is yeasty and wheaty and very zippy with carbonation at first. It then reveals some fruit and malts - while maintaining a lot of bubbly zing tickling the surface of the tongue. The finish has more soft fruit, lots of wheat, some yeast, and some subtle hop bitterness. The finish is somewhat dry, wheaty, and yeasty, with a delicate touch of bitterness. Overall, the flavor seems disappointingly watery and has a peculiar funk that is hard to describe - it seems a clash between the darker, chewier flavors from roasted grains combined with the fruity weizen yeast flavors.

Pour with a thick light beige head, it is a dark copper cloudy color, with a few dark specks floating inside the glass, decent retention leaves a lasting tan ring.  Taste of yeast, with a touch of cinammon, flavor of bannana, fruity finish yet leaves the mouth fairly dry, just a touch of spice, no real notice of malts, well maybe just subtly, very subtly.  Good carbonation on the tongue, but a bit light in the mouth, I was expecting just a bit more mouthfeel.  Plenty of carbontion and it pricks my tongue all over.  There are plenty some good sour notes as one examines it longer, mostly yeast flavor, not as complex as I had hoped for, but still easily drinkable.","oklahoma city, Oklahoma, USA","jetzler"

755,"2006-07-02",3.1,".5L bottle.  Poured a tannish/brown color with a large head and lots of carbonation up the sides.  This was a little lighter in color than I was expecting for a dunkel though.  Aroma was weak, but had hints of some spice and some fruity esters.  Flavor was also rather weak.  Mainly yeast and cloves, but there was something offensive about it that I just couldnt put my finger on.  I may pick up another bottle of this if I see it again, because Im guessing that the bottle I was drinking wasnt anywhere near being fresh.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"

Unfortunately the body is too thin.  I found watery.  Definitely let this one warm up some.  It was much too bland and watery right out of the fridge, but was notably improved later on.  The beer goes down easy and doesnt linger.  Its fairly good, but thus far I prefer the other three Ayinger beers that Ive tried.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"

As the temperature comes up, the normal weizen banana notes come forward along with a heavily toasted malt aroma.  Very wheaty.  Orange/lemon citrus.

755,"2006-05-07",3.4,"(500 ml bottle: $2.59 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA) Second attempt with this beer, so hopefully its fresher and more enjoyable.  This beer pours a translucent, glowing, golden-amber color, but the fizzy, off-white head dissipates rapidly, leaving just a small ring as proof of its existence.  Quite a lot of sweet banana, spice and wheat in the nose.  Wheat malts are the most prevalent in the flavor, with banana, apples and cloves showing less presence.  I thought a previous bottle of this was off because of the light apple, but maybe thats just the way it is.  Fairly sweet in general, and the wheat shows a touch of breadiness, and as the temperature of beer increases, so too does the breadiness, but enough to cause me any distress.  Medium-full bodied and well-carbonated, but tiring out the palate as the beer warms up.  Definitely one of the better imported Dunkelweizens Ive had the opportunity to try, but Ayinger usually is near the top of the heap with most everything I try of theirs.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Ill drink this in a toast to his generosity. This bottle poured a very cloudy and murky deep amber/brown body, capped my a lucious and creamy foamy cap. In the nose, sweet banana is the main contender. Also in the ring arespicy cloves, and an underlying bready aroma. Flavours consist of sweet fruit and clove, apple pastries, and just a tad of a bitter bite. Smooth finish, with a slight fruity bite that lingers. This style keeps me wanting more.

755,"2006-01-07",3.6,"Any first impressions?
-An initially lofty head dissipates on the hazy amber-brown fire.
-Plump banana esters, red apple peel, mild cloves, and plentiful straightforward yeast leap from the glass.
-Fizzy, expansive carbonation throws the banana sweetness and earthy yeast onto the tastebuds quite directly.

What if you dig deeper?
-Citrusy fruitiness surrounds it all, making it rather quenching.
-Peaches have fallen on the soil.
-Dry, bready yeast takes care of the finish without its many esters.
-The flavor profile is a little too yeast-driven for my tastes, nearly burying the malt, but this is nonetheless a very good dunkelweizen.

Bottle; no date to be read.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
755,"2005-12-28",3.6,"It strikes you that this is going to be a Bock, with its rich golden color and frothy cream-colored head.  But by the nose it has you thinking hefeweizen, with some clove and citrus, though plenty of malt and dry hops as well, with a bready yeasty quality--not always my favorite, in truth.  But for flavor and mouthfeel, there is something very rewarding here.  With a rich, light corn syrup-like texture, the beer clings to your mouth to impart a front flavor of caramel, bread, Eastern European snacks, and pretzels, with longer notes of citrus, clove, anise, apple, and banana.  Nice blend of things.  There is something slightly too much ""German"" for my taste--perhaps too dry at times--but this is still perfectly respectable.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
755,"2005-12-21",4.1,"An almost-tan head took a lifetime to settle over a dense, murky, brownish/copper-wheat body. Yeast particulate is diverse, from the silt that forms the haze to plastery chunks at the bottom, with little sea-monkeys bobbing about at mid-level. As far as the aroma, smoked banana smells much better than youd imagine. Add to that roasted corn husks, clove, licorice and a touch of crawlspace (musty, earthen, moldiness). Flavor captures the hefeweizen essence of the aromas and sets it upon a substantially malted body... which gives a nice, hearty impression of a chocolate-covered banana. Thick, full-bodied and flavorful, with a creaminess in the mouth, its with beers like this that I can justify why Dunkelweizen is currently my favorite style.

Smooth banana crème and caramel chews provide the first layer.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper and cloves spice up the next.  Slight hint of brown sugared rum raisins and golden delicious apples.  Sweet and graceful on the palate, departing with much of the same flavoring profile as it rode in on.

Wheaty, lemony/banana, yeasty aroma with plenty of sweet malts underneath.  Carbonation is very high and definitely detracts from the taste.  Its still very apparent that this is a delightfully well-balanced beer.  Ample sweet, bready malts compliment the wheat and yeasty tanginess throughout.

755,"2005-08-06",4.0,"Lovely hazed magenta, soft cocoa, with a lovely, light layer of foam atop. Excellent look for the style.
Aroma: Ahhhh! this is dunkel weizen! Clove is huge, and banana behind it, with traces of grapes and melons and berries, too...a beautiful mix, really, and the sort of thing you only find in beers of this kind. Reminds me of why I like the style so much. Masterful.
Taste: mmmm...theres a lot to talk about...bubblegum, banana, spices, clove, dark fruits, ...but still quaffably refreshing!
An excellently sessionable brew, you can take several in all night long,

755,"2005-07-28",4.0,"Call me a generous rater or just think of me as a sucker, but i love an aroma that is as full and natural as this brew right here. It has a strong presence of banana and wheat while also giving a fresh bubblegum aroma. Its almost like i just stuck my nose in one of those nickel gum ball machines. To bad the flavor isnt as plump and sheer as the aroma had promised. The little minor descriptions of flavor start off with a mellow use of grain and semi bittering hop, while a ever present bubble gum and banana flavor is the most note worthy feature. Hints of clove, and other spice used as well as a squeeze of lemon too.

Hazy but mostly clear brownish yellow orange; sizable fluffy off-white head that is mostly lasting with a thick, sliding lacing on the side of the glass.  Lots of visible carbonation cascading up the glass.  Ruby tones to the color in the light.  Smells of sweat, orange peel, lemon zest, spices, bread and yeast.  Same wheaty malt and creamy dark malt flavors as Aventinus with some orange and mango acidity.  Somewhat biting carbonation at first, mellows after a while.  Musty malt backbone gives great body, which is accented by barely noticable European hops with no bittering influence.  Finish is malty and nicely acidic.  This almost tastes ""warm"" and ciderish due to the spicy flavors: nutmeg, cinnamon, corriander, black peppercorn.  Sour apple flavors lurk underneath everything as well.

Aroma of cloves, toffee, apples, banana, lightly toasted bready malts, and delicate spices.  Taste is all about the spicy yeast. Phenolic notes of  cloves, pear, and apple.  Sweet chewy initial taste becomes more dry and influenced by the wheat malt. There’s plenty of toffee, caramel sweetness, but it’s mostly hidden behind the immense yeastiness.

755,"2005-03-16",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2009 Walking around Johns Grocery, and there was the line of Ayinger beers calling out to me. There are so many I havent tried, I figured I could just pick one and probably it would be a rate. Nope. Realized as I was adding this I had had it before. Oh well. This was clearly a fresher example, so its nice to be able to bump my rating up a few points. 

Hazy orange, generous layer of lasting off-white head. Spicy hay nose, apples, warm rustic bread and a hint of butter in the background. Mint and apple flavor, yeasty baguette, sweet menthol finish. Soft and full, good depth and complexity. A beer very happy like this on its own, but one that suggests a myriad of possibilities paired with food.

(Previous rating, 3/16/2005. Pours light copper with a big head of light tan foam that fades quickly. Lemon, carmel, mild roast aromas, with a subtle spiciness. More sour lemon in the flavor, with hard-candy carmel. Soft, mouthfilling. Completely lacking the nice sparkly-bite I sort of expect with a weiss. This seems like well-crafted beer...just not all that interesting. Have I toasted my tastebuds with IPAs? No...I dont think so.

755,"2004-06-11",3.4,"This bottle had yeasty gook all over it. Literally all over it. I popped it and there was sediment all inside the rim of the bottle. So awesomely gross. So Awesomely gross. Pours with a Giant head, to big for my glass beer everywhere. I feel so german right now. Flavor is good but leaves a good bit to be desired. Very obscure in the nose and on the tongue. The only thing that comes to mind is the color grey, this is because nothing is too distinct. Malt has a lovely presence but it is obscured by the yeast. I either got a crappy bottle or this beer could be better. Its certainly not bad, but could benefit from some clarity.

I'd be great.

Taste is soft and mellow of banana and frothy malts, touch of lemon and clove, sweetness is light, citrus is flighty with a light but favorable carbonation with a mellow, nearly creamy medium body with a little touch of hop and dryness with clove hints in the finish.

755,"2003-07-21",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2007 This Ayinger offering spills into my stemmed glass a rich, hazy copper colour and forms a billowy off-white head, tall and creamy.  Strong yeast by-products dominate the aroma in the form of juicy bananas and sweet bubblegum.  Behind that impression can be found woodsy, floral hops and a toasted malt accent.  The flavour offers significantly more depth, bringing slightly tangy pecans and sweet, creamy apple butter together initially.  At the finish is the soft presence of Prince of Whales tea with honey and softly sweet benne wafers.  Pleasantly light notes of caramel appear in the aftertaste.  Whereas the aroma is soft and sweet, the flavour brings in a building tanginess for balance.  The body is suitably full for the style, not so thin as to feel lacking, nor so thick as to prevent refreshment.  The creamy texture and fine, champagne-like carbonation aid in the imminent drinkability of this beer.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

755,"2002-03-20",3.3,"Light amber with med head that dissipated very quickly.  Citrusy and spicy aroma.  Wonderful sweetness with great clove spiciness and a refreshing acidity.  Zesty and refreshing, finishing with some green apples tones.  Great flavor but not the total package.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
755,"2002-03-10",3.2,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2012 Bottle.

Head is initially large, creamy/frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy medium amber, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread, caramel), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a strong note of banana/gum/marshmallow, hint of pepper.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Quite the banana-candy bomb...cant say its unpleasant, but more malt and hop presence would help a lot, as would stronger pepper or clove phenols.  In the mouth its quite sweet...not enough tartness to clean things up.  Its a ""rich"" example I suppose but its too sweet and banana-heavy to be a winner.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
755,"2002-03-02",3.8,"Hazy ot quite copper. Suspended yeast particles throughout with nice head. Nose of bananas, spices and maybe apple. Soft, lively and almost creamy in the mouth. Flavors of cloves,spice,apples, and yeast. Maybe a tad too sweet? Pretty good and quite quaffable.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
755,"2002-02-18",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2003 Nice cloudy copperish brown appearance. Snow white head that stayed around for the duration. Body a little less that medium with high carbonation. A little light on the palate. Fruity, spicy flavor with hint of clove. Very drinkable and enjoyable beer.  Almost as good as Aventinus.","Roanoke, Virginia, USA","beerstop"

755,"2001-11-30",3.6,"The first thing I noticed after the pour was the great head that stayed with the beer for a while.  It was very clear for a wheat, which was unexpected.  The aroma was very fruity as was the flavor with a very dry finish.  It had a lot of body in the flavor, but the carbonation overpowered it in my opinion.  It was a good beer, but I have had better.  By the way, I drank this while putting up our family Christmas tree this year, so an early Merry Christmas to you all.  (Yeah, I had some SN Celebration Ale too...mmmmmm)","Austin, Texas, USA","Heat99"
755,"2001-10-29",3.7,"Sort of like a combination bock-weiss beer, and sort of successful.  Nice balance of malt and hops, but somewhat undermined by a serious carbonation issue.  This aint 7up, guys!  Smooth it out!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

755,"2001-08-29",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2003 A great beer.  The flavor was unbelievable. It didn't taste like an average beer, it was really good.  I would feel bad getting drunk to something as good as this. Absolutely great with lasagna.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"

755,"2001-07-16",2.9,"A fair beer, looked great, but sadly had a very unipressive taste, which was compounded by loose, foamy bubbles that were not creamy at all. Its not terrible, but not worth my time to drink again.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
755,"2001-07-15",2.9,"My 100th Rating! A fair beer.  Foamy (not creamy) head contained coarse bubbles, an indication of artificial carbonation.  The lackluster taste, along with its fizziness, account for my rather unfavorable opinion of this brew.  Looked great; a very dark, cloudy brown, with a lot of sediment.  However, the taste was so muted I was not able to distinguish individual flavors, and half way through the glass I stopped caring.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

755,"2001-04-01",4.3,"Very nice dunkel weisse.  I for one cant seem to detect the banana tones everyone else does, but the aroma is that of a hefe, for sure.  I couldt believe how much yeast was in this - when poured, it looked like thick apple cider (not hard).  Very nice flavor, definite fruity tones.  Mellow aftertaste.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"
