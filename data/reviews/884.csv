Flavour is similar, with melon and pear, along with moderate alcohol burn and light-to-medium sweetness. Nicely constructed. Good one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

884,"2010-12-23",3.2,"Has a slighty green body with a grassy aroma. Taste was nice, again with grassy notes. Touted as the best ""entry"" level sake from this maker, and it was indeed very drinkable.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
884,"2010-07-31",3.8,"Bottle at the breweryPale yellow color. Very nice melon and watermelon aroma, light bread; fresher than the Genshu and Nigori brothers. Good body structure, with light fruity flavor and strong final bitterness; the final is drier than the front and a bit astringent too. Interesting.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
884,"2010-03-11",3.3,"Bottle: Pours a tinge yellow with a few legs here and there. The nose is different than I was expecting, almost like paper and sawdust with a little umami. The flavor is very light, nearly no bite, alcohol, acidity or otherwise. Seems very mild and tame. The same note in the nose continues, an almost dried banana or powdered milk taste. Interesting. Very easy to drink as ethereal as it is with just a tinge of sweetness in the tail. Nothing to grab on to, so Ill just grab onto the glass and keep drinking. Good, but no reason why aside from not bad and nothing to really taste. Watery? No. Just a good sake without much aroma or umami. Good though.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

884,"2008-02-03",3.8,"Thanks to Oakes for sending this my way.  Ive been looking for a reason to crack this for about nine months.  I guess Groundhog Day is my reason.  Pale yellow straw coloured beer with an absolutely clear appearance.  Thick sticky legs.  Crisp melon and light lemon citrus.  Sweet flowery notes with some tapioca, pear and mangosteen.  Soft palate, nice lingering sweetness.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
884,"2007-01-20",3.5,"Absolutely clear.  Big fresh bouquet - slightly woody alcohol, koji, light florals.  Flavour has a slight sweetness, hints of balsa wood and spice.  The finish is quite dry, woody and warming.  Its not as complex as the aroma would lead me to believe but a nice, fresh-tasting sake.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
