3667,"2017-06-22",4.0,"12 oz bottle poured. Much thanks to mcberko for holding on to this one for me! A beer that by the sound of it, theres no way it could be bad. Dark, reddish copper pour with almost no head. A big aroma of maple, spices, and brown sugar from quite a distance. Very aromatic. Flavor is quite a bit boozy up front, but seems to mellow out nicely, all things considered. Maple, raisin, bourbon constant. Slight licorice. Lingering bourbon late finish. Very unique and special beer here. Excellent.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
3667,"2017-06-22",3.6,"12 oz. bottle, pours a dark chestnut brown with a small white head. Aroma brings out tons of bourbon barrels, burnt brown sugar and a hint of toffee. Flavour is intense, with lots of bourbon barrels, burnt brown sugar, toffee and alcohol. It sure is intense, but its wonderfully structured. Complex and well-balanced.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3667,"2017-06-07",4.3,"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Dark, hazy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Alcohol/bourbon nose and flavor is sweet alcohol and dark fruit. Bottled Mar 2016. Expensive at $14.95 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","Bow, New Hampshire, USA","jimhilt"
3667,"2017-04-08",4.2,"EBF Boston 2017. Monstre à 18,5%. Un liquide brun sans mousse. Cette bière sent très bon, sucre brun, cest enrobant. La bouche est surprenante, digeste, peu sucrée, elle coule seule, riche mais pas écurant. Le gaz carbonique est bien dosé ce qui laide à descendre. Troisième coup de cur.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
3667,"2017-01-01",3.9,"2017/01/01 - Pours a clear, deep amber colour with a thin, foamy, khaki head that quickly dissipated and leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is maple candy, burnt caramel, brown sugar, oak, bready notes and vanilla. Taste is more maple, oaky vanilla hints of dark fruit, toffee and booze. Mouthfeel is very hot. Medium and oily body with almost no carbonation and a long, sweet, boozy, warming finish. Mellows as it warms. Surprisingly drinkable and not as harsh as I had expected for 18.5%. Well executed.","Ontario, CANADA","Alpha10"

3667,"2016-12-26",4.0,"Bottle. The look is a slight haze, slight tan head, reddish amber in color. The smell is fruitcake, bourbon, super strong, alcohol, toffee, sugary, maple, and wood. The taste is the same big booze character, big bold beer. Good stuff.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
3667,"2016-12-24",3.4,"Pours a still cognac color... aroma of brown sugar, bourbon, maple syrup, booze... Flavor is fairly sweet and sugary with notes of maple syrup, brown sugar, char and distilled spirits... Lots of spirit burn on palate, like grain alcohol on palate... Flavor hides it well but finishes like the beast it is... definitely a sipper and not a favorite one at that","California, USA","baraciisch"

3667,"2016-09-30",3.9,"The aroma is fruit, bourbon, caramel, bread. The appearance is clear amber, thin white head. The flavor is sweet, fruity, maple syrup, bourbon, bread. The finish is boozy, sweet. Medium in body, slightly thick, and greasy feeling. Nice, enjoyable. For the most part, this is a one and done. Especially at $15 for a 12 oz.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
3667,"2016-09-24",4.2,"Fucking hell this is a big beer. Coppery color and a boozy aroma. Boozy sweet flavor - syrupy, malty, and sugary. Its an intense brew. Whats remarkable is that this beer isnt as huge and crazily alcoholic as youd think. The heat is kept to a tolerable level. Like Averys Tweak, this beer is boozed up in a giant way but it isnt classless. You cant help but be impressed by how tasty this brew is in spite of all the booze.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
3667,"2016-09-23",3.7,"Bottle.

A- Brown sugar, burnt caramel, alcohol.

A- Copper color, clear liquid, minimal beige head.

T- Booze, brown sugar, caramel, coconut, vanilla.

P- Full body, average texture, average carbonation, boozy finish.

O- For 18.5% is actually doesnt feel that big. More like 8%. Still glad to have split the 12 oz bottle with a friend. Resembles a barleywine and honestly no single flavor or aroma stands out. Still pretty tasty, but at $15 for 12oz, I doubt Ill be buying it again.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"

Aroma is moderate brown sugar, bready malt, dates, figs, moderate booze and light coconut. Flavor is sweet brown sugar and cookie malt, dates and figs, coconut and booze with a sweet, yet boozy drying finish. Full body and medium carbonation. This is fairly sweet and boozy but this may subside with a lot of age. I would love to revisit this in 3 or so years.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

The nose is strong bourbon notes of oak, caramel, and vanilla, with some butterscotch, molasses, and earth. Very sweet and boozy, with a bit of bitterness to cut things a bit. Immense body, sticky, thick, and creamy mouthfeel. This is an oppressively big beer; very malty and boozy.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

3667,"2016-06-12",4.2,"12 ounce bottle, bottled on March 3 2016. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a mostly clear reddish/copper color with about an inch light tan head that didnt stick around for very long. Theres also a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and sweet, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, maple, dark fruit, oak, sugar and caramel. The taste pretty much follows the aroma with bourbon, maple, vanilla, booze, dark fruit (cherry, raisins), brown sugar, oak and caramel flavors. And yeah, it is boozy but thats to be expected for something thats 18.5% ABV. Mouthfeel/body is full, its a bit slick and syrupy with moderate carbonation. I thought this was a good brew, definitely worth picking up if youre into barrel-aged brews and/or old ales! $12.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
3667,"2016-06-04",4.2,"The base old ale really works well with the house over-the-top Avery barreling. 18.5% is felt, but isnt stupid.

3667,"2016-06-01",3.8,"1 June 2016, bottle. Pink/brown. Nose is sweet fermenting bread, maybe sweet old cheese. Med body and mildly fizzy. Surprisingly not boozy, but alcohol is noticeable.

3667,"2016-05-22",3.8,"12 oz bottle from Party Source at home. Pours a clear amber color with a small off white head that collapsed to a thin ring. The aroma has big sweet malts, caramel, maple syrup, bourbon, vanilla and alcohol. The flavor has more sweetness, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, maple syrup, oak, with quite a bit of alcohol still present. This might be better with time. I still like what they did, but all the sweetness still couldnt contain the alcohol. The good news is this will be available in Ohio soon since we are getting rid of the 12% cap.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

3667,"2016-04-29",3.9,"Aroma of vanilla bourbon oak and slight sugar finish with some booze. Quite nice aroma. Initial sips were almost too boozy, strong and astringent. After a few more sips though it is growing on me. Has nice sweetness to it without being syrupy. It is almost dry, but a boozy dry. Bourbon oaky tannic woody dryness as well. Nice bourbon vanilla flavors. Sugars are fermented away and it is ""liquidy"", not sticky and cloying. Complex with lots going on here, many sips I like it a lot and some sips it is too boozy, but overall it is a very interesting strong beer very worthy of trying. But it is a sipper.

Excellent sipper.

Pours a cloudy amber/crimson with heavy lacing against the glass. Taste brings massive booze, burnt sugar, cough syrup and maple upfront which falls into a very disjointed mess of oak, sugar, caramel, mismatched malts, wort, honey, maple, vanilla and bourbon. Finishes very metallic, boozy, and sugary with a funky residual malt that sits poorly on the palate.

3667,"2016-03-30",4.0,"12 oz. bottle. Pours medium thin light beige head, which is poorly retained, but continually renewed by the clear effervescent dark copper (SRM 18) body.......nose is Bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark fruits including plum, raisin, with molasses, cocoa, pecan pie notes, light tobacco.....taste is sweet with notes of molasses, brown sugar, dried fruits including fig, raisin, plum, Bourbon, vanilla, oak arrive later, finishing with hints of cocoa, light umami and tobacco......mouth feel, light of medium body, sticky alcohol heat present with nearly a burn present, carbonation high with light acid. This is one humongous Old Ale. The only element that is a bit too much is the alcohol, which is partially, but not very well hidden by the malts, barrel, and additives.
