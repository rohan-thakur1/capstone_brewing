394,"2017-05-22",3.4,"A corked-n-caged cream ale. God I love craft beer. Too bad Im not over the moon with this particular craft beer; big, heavy funk melding with the grass-n-corn soul of a cream ale isnt a flavor I wholeheartedly dig. Nose is neutral graininess backed up by a modest swipe of barnyard, and the looks are rather sexy, hazy gold with a massive, lingering white head and ample lace. Taste mixes corn sweetness with bitter floral hops, all set against a bready middle and ever-present funk. Slight tart notes prop up the back end, and the finish is appreciably dry and yeasty, yet the general cream ale blah-ness keeps the pint from becoming anything exceptional. Drinkable, though, and the sparkly texture invites further investigation. Worth trying for the curiosity factor alone.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
394,"2017-03-30",3.9,"375 mL bottle. Hazy orange with a big fluffy head that lasts and lasts. Smells of sweet corn and cereal malt. Yeasty ""funk"" or ""barnyard"" or whatever you want to call it. A little floral, too. Tastes grassy and even a little herbal up front. Bitter and yeast immediately. Some of the corn sweetness comes through, but it has an earthy and, seemingly, bretty finish. I had no clue what to expect from the label. This was a pleasant surprise.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
394,"2017-03-26",3.9,"Thanks Carl! Awesome cream ale...pretty much a sour cream ale. Funky, tart, with good hay, grassy body. Excellent mouthfeel with creaminess coming through but still sharp in the taste profiles. Yum.","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"
394,"2017-03-22",4.0,"1/3/17. Bottle thanks to CORRRRRALLLLLLLL! Orange pour with a nice off-white head. Funky aroma, touches of tartness, hints of straw, hay, corn, pale malts. Good flavor, again funky and mildly tart, clean pale malts, hay. Surprised this isnt listed as sour/wild ale.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
394,"2017-03-13",3.7,"Tasting at MattsHazy blond color, thin head. Strong funky character, permeating aroma and flavor; highly carbonated dry mouthfeel; a bit of vegetable bitterness in the final.Excellent Wild beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
394,"2017-03-02",3.6,"375mL bottle, pours a hazy dull golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out notes of corn, straw and cereal malt. Flavour is much more on the funky side, which drowns out any cream ale elements, with the funky wild yeast upfront and dried out biscuity malt. Dry, moderately funk and almost champagne-like on the finish. Nice stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
394,"2017-03-02",3.6,"Cloudy, dull tan. The aroma shows off brett, footy yeast notes. On the palate, light body, grainy if you use your imagination. Not much hop. Brett is the first order of the day, but theres a lot of funky yeast. Off-dry finish. They are definitely taking some liberties with the style, but who knows what yeast was like in the late 1800s. Ill let it slide.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
394,"2016-12-20",3.7,"Bottle. Slightly hazy yellow color, medium white head. Aroma of toasted cereal. Taste is lightly funky Cheerioes. Tasty and easy drinking.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
394,"2016-11-08",4.1,"Bottle from Milk and Hops Chelsea. Unclear brighter orange color with a thick, frothy beige head that leaves some coating lace. Really nice yeast-forward aroma, with some pepper, funk, lemon, grains, and grass. Spice/pepper comes out more in the flavor with a funk and citrus showing up late. Drinks nicely, lively carbonation, and a long, spicy, tingly close. Would have been likely to guess it was a Saison blind, I dont get a lot traditional Cream Ale flavors, but it has excellent flavor development. Really liked it.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
394,"2016-11-03",3.7,"Hazy golden pour. Big white head. Lacing. Malty, earthy yeast note with a slight Brett note (lemony). Taste is the same notes. Brighter Brett presence. Good.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"
394,"2016-10-19",3.9,"The beer pours golden with a large white head. The aroma had rustic notes, stone fruit, spice, pears and light funk. It has a medium body with lots of carbonation. The taste has the aroma traits along with pepper, sulfur, leaves and under ripe peaches. Really nice and certainly not what youd expect from something called a cream ale.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
394,"2016-10-06",4.0,"Deep hazy-golden. Rocky white head slowly disperses. Spellbinding brettcentric aromas of perfumey, sherbety and airy phenolics, along with black tea, cantaloupe, plaster, honeycomb, lemon, apricot, band-aid and cookie. Expansive effervescence. Peppery phenols unleash a palate-scrubbing briskness on initial sip, as a malty sweetness gracefully settles in to anchor the body. In contrast to the brett-derived sherbety brightness, pervasive band-aid notes arise with considerable vivacity. Intricate phenols continually unfold, generating a potent airiness amplified by gunpowder and zippy white pepper characteristics along the way. Sugars are masterfully integrated with the airy elements, and exhibit a succulence which elicits thoughts of cantaloupe drenched in flower nectar. Creamy and understatedly rich malt exudes long-boil depth and refinement with its silky waves of honey-kissed hay topped with a hint of shortbread, thats seamlessly interwoven with the brilliantly incorporated hop oils. Thoroughly extracted malt stops just short of hinting at melanoidins, although the powdery textures and pastrylike depth are perfectly weighted, inducing saliva as they fill the mouth. A peppery crackle wavers in and out of the striking delicatenesses, lending an appetizing effect while aiding the flawless attenuation with a snappy twinge. A rosewater-like softness dovetails with equally elegant and delicate orange-blossom notes in the artfully balanced and flowery finish. Wow, another beautiful brett showcase from this brewery, right up there with their apricot saison (which is anything but a fruit beer). There is a purity here that makes me shiver, especially the aroma. I must say I was disheartened to see they (seemingly) strayed from their forte of making saison, as this just sounds silly on paper (and just about any other brewery whod attempt this would almost certainly result in an aimless mess), but the spirit of the saison is all here here, as is BFBs signature trademark: balance. Lovely!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
394,"2016-10-01",3.3,"Kind of a delicate beer all around. Looks delicate in the glass, with a light cream-colored head and a straw-yellow body. Mild aromas of hay and spice, with sour stone fruit, grains and barley on the tongue. Slightly sweet and slightly sour. Medium palate.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"
394,"2016-09-30",2.7,"Wow this is funky. I was expecting a regular cream ale, but it's so not. Very neat!

394,"2016-09-18",2.6,"Golden yellow pour with a frothy white head. Lots of earthy notes here, but very little cream presence. Malts are not too present either.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","weitz15"
394,"2016-09-11",3.7,"Corked and caged 375. Hazy yellow with a big white head of foam. Some corn and dried grass. Moderate sweetness. A bit dry. Medium body and soft carbonation.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
394,"2016-09-03",3.7,"375 ml bottle from the Party Source. Pours a hazy golden color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor pale malts, some corn character, fruity, mild tart, Brett funk, light peppery notes, quite a bit more character than your usual cream ale, Im surprised.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
394,"2016-08-29",4.0,"If you can make a cream ale interesting, youre a pretty good brewery. Pours golden and bubbly, with a lot of loose white foam. Smells grassy with notes of corn, and some brett notes. Taste has some funk, with some grass and sweet corn. I get some white wine notes, too. Surprisingly good.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
394,"2016-08-23",3.7,"Yeast-driven aroma is musty, phenolic, peppery, fabric-like, rustic, tending to BO-like brett and even some lactic acid resemblance. Malt is grainy, grist-like, and Im trying not to be suggested corn but I do get some cornmeal-polenta character in there. Light-bodied, bubbly and effervescent natural carbonation, succulent sweetness. Lively and soft and delicate, fluffy and tart. Really nice flavor balance, good play of bitter and acid and malt sugar, elevated by the natural carbonation. From bottle.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
394,"2016-08-22",3.8,"Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy/frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is light yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, cereal), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs), lightly yeasty (barnyard), with light notes of hay, meadow. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.
Quite nice for the style, certainly not what you would expect from hearing the phrase cream ale. Rustic and very well balanced, nice texture too. Not super complex in the nose, but quite pleasant. If anyone could make a cream ale enjoyable, it would stand to reason that BFB would be the ones to do it. What a great brewery.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
394,"2016-08-21",2.6,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2016 375 ml. bottled 2016/06/03. Hazy amber-orange with a thin creamy head. Nose is light citrus, honey, white grape and mild funk. Tastes mostly of wild yeast. Then theres some honey, toasted corn and white wine which dont really help. Near-medium body has a decent balance but too much fizz.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
394,"2016-08-04",3.8,"First! Smaller format cork and caged bottle. Light orange in color with citrus notes. As a cream ale, it is not, and that is ok. The local yeast takes over and smooths the beer out with some nice notes. That might be some corn in the background...","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
