Smells of unripe banana and earth covered cherries, together with a decent spiciness. Offers a subtle smokiness with more, riper banana. 

Has a higher carbonation with an utmost soft mouthfeel to it, due to the mellowing yeast pillow, building the foundation of this, together with a stony mineral quality to it.

Tastes of banana peel thrown onto forest earth, while offering smoked ham underneath, adding a unique twist to the earth. Together with an incredible smoothness, peppery spices and minerals become visible, resulting into an enjoyable refreshment. Finishes very clean, with earthy malts and a subtle sourness, providing a silk aqueous softness.

765,"2015-11-19",3.7,"Pours a cloudy dark chestnut brown color with dark amber edges and a two finger, frothy off-white head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Very good retention, taking a while to settle and leaving sporadic streaks of soapy lacing behind. 

Inviting aroma with a nice balance of zesty spice, bready yeast, light fruit, citrus and slightly roasted malt. Very peppery with a strong clove presence followed by sourdough bread, banana and bubblegum. Theres also a decent amount of citrus peel but its somewhat overshadowed by the darker malt bill. Subtle roast with sweeter caramel, toffee, hazelnut and biscuit character. Nice complexity in the nose with a decent roasted malt presence thats well integrated into the weisse bier elements. 

Medium body with soft carbonation and a strong peppery spice presence up front that lingers over the yeast, citrus and sweeter malt notes into a spritzy, tart finish. Hints of black pepper and clove dominate at first but are soon countered by some sourdough bread and banana before some citric acidity kicks in on the back end. The malt presence isnt as prominent as in the nose but its still evident with subtle roast and hints of toasted malt, hazelnut, caramel and toffee. Decent amount of sweetness without taking away from the classic wheat beer flavors. Slightly tart lemon juice/pith flavor toward the back of the palate. Crisp and refreshing and while its heavier than an average weissebier, its still pretty easy to drink.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Aroma wise there is plent of dark fruits, caramel and a slight hint of chocolate and citrus. Tastewise this beer is deceptive. It looks as though it should be heavy but in fact Ive had stronger tasting lagers. The most notable thing is the carbonation in the moth - again almost coke like! However, the is a sweet maltiness that passes through fruitiness to dark chocolate with a dry bitter finish. This beer is an enigma.

Die Optik nach dem Einschenken ist einfach klasse, wenn auch nicht perfekt. Der Antrunk ist jedoch enttäuschend: Ein geschmackliches Bermuda-Dreieck! Bis auf etwas Malz und säuerliche Fruchtigkeit - nichts! Erwartet hatte ich vollmundige Sämigkeit - ich bekomme jedoch eher eine leicht-wäßrige Erfrischung. Hefe ist am Glasboden, doch ich kann sie nicht schmecken, sad but true!
Tut mir leid, aber für ein ANDECHS geradezu enttäuschend, wobei die Meßlatte bei dieser Klosterbrauerei naturgemäß sehr hoch liegt.

Much less full-on sweet as some of my fave (and the best rated on RB) exemplars such as NG Black Wheat. Just more natural and earthy, grainy.

A - Very dark chestnut brown with some ruby hues. About average sized rocky, foamy, light beige head. Disappears fairly fast with no lacing left, but a lot of bubbles.

S - A lot of banana and caramel malt. Very much like a banana bread. Fair amount of bubblegum as well. Some clove and citrus along with a touch of other fruitiness. Nice typical dunkelweizen aroma.

T - Similar to the nose. Strong banana and caramel flavor with some nutty flavor. Similar to a banana bread. Some clove taste as well. Some fruit apart from the banana gives it a bit of a fruitcake taste as well. The flavors are a bit on the thin side, but they are enjoyable.

M - Medium to light body, with it being a bit more on the light side, with a bit above average carbonation. Pretty fizzy feel.

D - Really easy to drink beer. With pretty typical dunkelweizen flavors. None of the flavors are too strong or overpower the palate, but it has a good amount of flavor.

Bottle brown, 500 ml
Appearance: Pours with medium, off - white, slightly beige head colour, it is frothy in texture and quite quickly decreasing to small in size. The lacing is smaller than the one of ’Andechser Weissbier Hefetrub’ but still exist. Body looks medium, is cloudy, opaque and brown in colour with some reddish shades. Carbonation of body is weak.
Aroma: Whipped cream, Munich malt, slightly toasty malted barley and typical for ’Andechs’ beer, flowery hops with a noticable hint of clover. Gentle banana note, some fresh juicy sweetness. Caramel, burned sugar. All in all aroma is more intensive than in ’Andechser Weissbier Hefetrub’ especially due to smaller head but in fact it is one of the most interesting aroma of Dunkel Weizen style of beer I’ve had so far.
Flavour: Front is mild and salty on tongue, carbonation on palateis salty and quite lively what creates very impressive profile. There are pronounced notes of toastyness and later on roastyness on palate. Finish duration is medium to long.
Palate: Body is medium, texture is smooth, between wattery to creamy, carbonation on palate is quite lively. Finish feel is a bit chalky and slightly accidic.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

The aroma was bananas, light toasted/roasted notes, some spicing. The flavor was tilted towards the spices, which was really quite nice. Keeping the tingle of the spices at the front, avoiding banana ester overload, and also ducking the overly roasted character of some run of the mill dunkelweizens gets this a few extra points in my book.

765,"2006-04-25",4.0,"On tap at The Andechs Klostergasthof.  Cloudy, rusty chocolate brown in color with a creamy tan head that later on hosts a head retention clinic.  Perfect aroma, hands down.  Chocolate covered ripe-fried bananas, surrounded by cloves and pepper, which entertain some mocha bean grinds.  Quite the refreshing take on a flavorful bounty.  Ginger accents are overlayed with chocolate powder, and then the combination of the two are sprinkled on bananas.  Cloves and pepper happily continue with some background white chocolate for complexity.  Modest carbonation and refreshingly light bodied.  Banana crème with a muted chocolate flavors bring things to a close, semi-subconsciously accented by a minor dose of cleansing lemon.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Aroma of wheat with complex smokey, maltiness, and a great sweetness also.

This starts out nicely with a substantial thick off-white head that does what a good Dunkelweizen head should do.
Yeasty, slightly sour aroma that has some nuttiness.
Ruddy brown in color with a typical wheat haze to it.
Smooth palate delivers a very pleasing sweetness that carries a bit of tartness in the finish. Well done and Im sure would be worth a try fresh on the other side of the big water where it would be even better than the one I have here.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

765,"2005-01-02",3.2,"Tawny colour, with a ruby tinge. Modest, but lasting, beige head. Low, but persistent carbonation. If theres supposed to be a yeast sediment, its not much in evidence. Creamy wheat aroma, with a touch of spice and vanilla. Not much sign of banana, or malt. Fresh and clean on the palate. Creamy vanilla again in the flavour. Theres something a bit dark, maybe chocolate, and vaguely smoky, but not exactly malty. Starts sweet but finishes with some acidity. Compromised by a slight metallic tang in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Perfectly serviceable, but not a standout. 500ml bottle, from beersofeurope.co.uk. My bottle was 5.0% by the way.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
