The aroma is dominated by dark chocolate, with some licorice, pumpernickel, and rye. Sweet and malty, with just a bit of roasted bitterness that balances nicely. Light to medium body, creamy, velvety, and malty. This is an easy and flavorful mild. Smooth, balanced flavor, and a luxurious mouthfeel.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

3486,"2013-03-24",3.8,"Half pint draft at Hogshead in Denver, Colorado.  The pour is a clear brown, slight ruby with an off white head.  The aroma is toffee malt, nice roast, and a fruit apple sweetness.  The taste is really smooth, with the toffee malt, roast and grass light fruit sweetness.  The roast flavor carries the finish, and really gives it a nice round full flavor.  The palate is light bodied, soft carbonation, and the excellent roast finish.  Really drinkable, really well executed session beer.  I need more beers like this in my life.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3486,"2012-10-17",3.9,"A huge old-world style throw-down, with toasted, chocolaty, earthy moldy, herbal/woody, mellow booze stuff you get from English funked out yeast (this aint no WLP002, or maybe it is but hes been using it for generations) and British Pale Malt (guessing Maris Otter). Booyah! Ill drink it all day.","Denver, Colorado, USA","potbeerjob"

3486,"2012-10-12",2.7,"Clear dark brown hued with a quickly dissipating head, though it leaves great lace. The aroma is kinda nutty with caramel tones with crystal malts. The flavor, unfortunately, falls kinda short. Has a light body with a semi-metallic aftertaste. In between is ok, with mild tones of caramel grains and light hop bitterness. But its hard to get anything else through the metallic taste and light body. Dry bready finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3486,"2012-10-11",3.7,"Draught at the brewery, on October 10, 2012Sweet, malty, caramel taste. Medium mouthfeel, medium bitterness. Sweet, malty scent. Very nice and drinkable. Grainy aftertaste. Hazy dark copper color, tan head.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
3486,"2012-09-10",3.7,"firkin at the brewery.  dull brown body with a medium-sized tan head and lasting retention.  has the same cognac / whiskey / apple / brined cherry malt character as the Chin Wag and Boys from the marris otter, though more of a toasted grain character, and surprisingly distinct chocolate / coffee / char note from the minor additions of chocolate and black patent.  soft, musty, doughy yeast has a touch of greenness (mold?); Fuggles are subdued but still appropriately mossy / woody / soil-like; body is light but carbonation is round, full and rich.  becomes a tad watery as it warms and opens, and its a little more yeast-heavy than Id prefer, but altogether its low gravity, succulent marris otter malt, subtly roasty chocolate malt and musty / moldy old-world English yeast character is a very enjoyable combination.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3486,"2012-09-06",4.1,"Hand pull.  Pours clear tawny with a large, creamy off-white head, long retention with excellent lacing.  Aroma is chocolate, light caramel and toast, biscuit malt, light earthy hops and frutiy esters.  Flavor is lightly sweet malt, light hops and bitterness, fruity estes and a sweet finish.  Light body, medium carbonation.  A very pleasurable Mild Ale, probably the best one I have ever had - I am hard pressed right now to remember a better one.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
3486,"2012-08-12",3.9,"Pour on tap at the brewery, this was my favorite and I wish this was on cask instead cause it would have made it that much better.  Dark brownish red pour with thin off white head, aroma brought notes of nice cocoa powder, nuts, earth and musty notes, hints of bready and yeasty malts, touch of toffee and caramel as well, balanced very well.  Taste is a nice mix of dark cocoa powder with hints of caramel and nuts, some bitter earthy musty notes with a touch of yeast, some bready malts come back with a touch of grass and bittering hops, finishing fairly clean, nice balance of sweet and bitter and dry.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"

3486,"2012-07-07",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2012 [I have tried this a few more times since my initial rating - all newer samples have been clear - no present yeast - I think the yeast muddled some of the flavors in my original sample - aside from the roast and minerals, there are a lot of underlying complexities, like fig and raisin and damp oak - however, the dry and roasty character remains center stage - I love this beer so much] Tap at the brewery - turbid dark ruby pour - a really well executed dark mild - very dry, with complex notes of dry roasted nuts, cocoa, moderate acidity, lightly fruity hops, a bit of roast and a nice mineral bite on the finish - a bit of earthy hop character - very quaffable and tasty!","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
