1760,"2010-01-11",3.9,"I like this a lot.The taste is something akin to a dunkle but orange amber in color like a Vienna only unfiltered and hazy and made w/ the use of caramel malt, which is not typical of either style, and roasted barley which is forbidden by the Reinheitsgebot. The nose is fantastic, mildly sweet and bursting w/ malt character and a faint dusting of either very fresh noble hops or a bit. The flavor is nearly so good w/ notes of chocolate and more malt nuances coming to the light as it warms slightly, all balanced by a mild hop presence. My one complaint is that the carbonation is overly mild, leading to the impression of wateriness which never suits any beer. Overall, this is simply a fantastic lager bier made somewhat close to several traditional styles w/o being a perfect match for any of them. This is one I intend to resample in the future. I can see myself being fived by this sucker if they ever make a small adjustment to the level of carbonation.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Caramelized, bready malts remain crisp enough to build a sessionable and clean Vienna-style experience, while leafy hops brush its background efficiently.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the clear, dark russet.
-Bitterness (and hop presence overall) is quite low. The finish remains quite dry though.
-Slight fruitiness roams throughout, but never bothers.
-This is not a memorable lager, but I’m sure it’s always a pleasant pint when you’re thirsty.

1760,"2008-03-10",3.9,"A vigorous pour yields a three-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is an amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, deeply reddish hued, copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma is a nice mix of dry & sweet malt notes and a touch of spicy hop character.  Ample toasty malt, biscuit notes and bread crust aromatics mix in with notes of caramelized malt sugars, and a soft, berry like fruitiness.  The hops seem to accent the berry notes as well as provide a touch of herbal character.  This is most definitely a malt dominated beer, but I like the mix of malt notes here and the hops add just a little something to the aroma.

Quite spicy tasting, much more so than the aroma would have suggested; the beer has notes of grassy herbs, woody black pepper and an underlying spicy herbal note that is quite noticeable throughout each sip but most noticed up front..  This is still a substantially malt driven brew though as flavors of toasted biscuits, toasted whole grain bread, browned soda crackers and lots of spicy rye notes.  This has a light grain / malt sweetness to it that is a touch caramelized in character.  That berry note is here in the flavor too and still seems to be derived from a mix of malt and hop notes.  This has a light-medium heft to it that keeps this from being a beer you could pound.  It is a touch viscous and this really adds a nice texture, which in combination with the grain makes this a chewy brew.

This beer is quite spicy, I think this is driven by both the hops and the rye, either way it makes this beer quite interesting.  One of the tastier O-fest beers I have had in a while and even though the rye is non-traditional, I really like its addition to this brew.

1760,"2006-04-29",3.3,"(330 ml bottle: Obtained 01-Mar-06 in trade with bogdi1, thanks Juha!) The label is ripped, so the only notch on the bottle is for April.  Since I just got this in a trade, Ill presume its April, 2006 and Im within the window.  Anyway, this is a great-looking Märzen: gorgeous copper color, perfect clarity, and a tall, light-tan head.  The nose is malty, lightly sweet, a bit earthy, and balanced by a pleasant citrusy tartness.  Quite balanced in the flavor as well, presenting moderate caramel and malt, along with a general earthiness, some chalk and a gentle, roasty character toward the finish.  But its only mildly sweet and has a modest amount of citrusy tartness and some light, hoppy bitterness in the finish.  On one hand, this balance is good because its fairly clean and doesnt bog down on the palate.  But on the other hand, the citrusy tartness makes it kind of an odd Märzen.  Body is light-medium, but with soft carbonation and a clean palate, this beer has a nice mouthfeel.  Could use a bit more body, but its a minor complaint.

1760,"2005-12-07",4.1,"Best before August 2005 33cL bottle consumed on 12/4/05.  Sent to me from Bogdi1, thanks Juha!Pours a deep cherry pie meat red, with some burnt ambers, light beige and auburns swirling about, and a mostly diminishing off-white head that is retained well at cover and provides ample lacing.  Plenty of sediment in the bottle and appears to be bottle conditioned.Aroma is sweet and creamy, with only light fruits (cherries, raisins, light berries) and mainly a sweet caramel and vanilla cream.  Fresh toasted barley malts, with even some green, leafy, lightly spicy hops.  Full and round, its one of those aromas that really fills up the senses.  Flavor is unlike any other Oktoberfest Ive had.  Lacking the grainy, drying, bready maltiness that is so dominant to the style, this one has a more reserved, creamy sweetness, toffee and caramel with vanilla and a fair amount of hop flavor (green, leafy, lightly spicy floral notes).  Moderate bitterness on end as well complements the creamy sweet malts.  Relatively low roast character, a slight dark brown bread sort of aspect is passing, with more earthiness and light spice.  Low, natural carbonation and a creamy, fluid texture.  The hops are amped up a bit in this example, moreso than traditionally done, but not too much so that it ruins the balance.  No alcohol apparency, surprisingly light yeast apparency.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1760,"2005-09-04",3.6,"(Bottle 33 cl) Dark amber with a nice, dense head. Very filling with a solid amount of malt sugars and some great hops to add both aroma and a rather distinct bitterness. A delicious brew - as most Nils Oscars. 050801","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
1760,"2005-08-25",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2006 Bottle. Nice head that disappeared to quick. Dark, copper color. Aroma with lots of malt, but also delicious fruity hints. The taste has some roasted element, but mostly malt-flavour, with a little alcohol in it.Quite balanced. Finishes with a light bitter aftertaste. Its a shame I only bought one bottle.

1760,"2005-01-30",3.7,"Bottled (BB 03/2005)
Dark copper brown with small off-white head. Excellent aroma of barley/bread with hints of caramel. Medium-bodied, malty with good balance of bread-like barley and soft flowery hops. Also roasted tones found. Balanced märzen (one of the best in this style), only finish is lacking some extra tickles. As in this style often, gives a  long dry aftertaste to mouth.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"
1760,"2005-01-18",3.8,"Wonderful dark copper to amber color. Fine white head that slowly vanishes. Strong bitterness crossed with malt and hops.

1760,"2004-10-02",3.8,"The colour is clear, deep copper red with brown tones. The medium-sized beige foam disappears into a very thin layer. 

The smell is somewhat sour with lots of malt. There are some notes of brown sugar and dough. 

The carbon dioxide is mild with small bubbles.

The burned, generous is taste is bitter with a little touch of metal. There are notes of almonds, and caramel malt. The aftertaste is dry, bitter and finishes with a slowly descending taste of dark bread.

This is a nice interpretation of the Märtzen concept. As usual, it is a really good beer from the small Nils Oscars brewery","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

Imho this is an vienna style beer....
I must admit that I have never been so impressed over a swedish beer, as I was with this one. From the nice dark colour, over the sweet aroma and the flavor of caramel, this beer is just nice.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","ThomasE"
