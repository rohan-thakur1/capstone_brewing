1675,"2016-02-26",4.0,"Very dark colour. Aroma is a coffeeish, smoky, roasty, appetizing nose. Has a sweet front, a light acidity from the coffee, a rich roasty character without bitterness (Timbertrain is one of the absolute best local roasters), creamy mouthfeel and a deliciously bitter, chocolatey finish. Very nice brew.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

1675,"2016-01-27",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2016 Very good aroma with a lot of coffee (or even a little bit coffee with milk). The same in taste - the coffee (with some milk) with roasted malt bitterness, some dark fruits. Good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"
1675,"2016-01-27",3.7,"650mL bottle, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma brings out lots of espresso and roast upfront. Flavour is along the same lines, with monolithic coffee / espresso notes, followed by a touch of roast. Very espresso-y and a touch of roast make this extremely enjoyable. Body is medium-light, but theres enough body to complement the flavour profile. One of Russells best beers. Very nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1675,"2016-01-23",3.7,"Bottle shared with northropfrye, poured in snifter. Smells kind of yeasty, which is a good thing. Appearance is dark body, mocha frothy head. Taste is pretty strong with coffee, nice bitterness. Palate is a touch oily, nice fizzy carbonation with a bitter finish.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","dreamflower"

Taste is roasted barley, coffee, bout quite smooth, not harsh, semi-bitter, but a touch of sweetness in there as well. Smooth palate. Quite nice.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
1675,"2016-01-20",3.4,"Bottle. Dark, nearly black pour with a mocha head. Aroma is strong, roasty coffee with some chocolate. Taste is tons of dark roast black coffee, pretty bitter and roasty, medium bodied and fairly simple. Would have liked a little more sweetness and richness to balance, but not a bad coffee stout if you like the bitterness.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
1675,"2015-12-20",3.5,"650ml bottle pours black in color with a finger and a half of light brown head that leaves some spotted lacing on the glass. Aroma is chocolate and roasted grains with some herbal and coffee notes. Taste is a roasted grain and herbal bitterness with a chocolate malty sweetness with a subtle roasted coffee finish. Very nicely crafted coffee stout, enjoyable, tasty and balanced. Recommended.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
