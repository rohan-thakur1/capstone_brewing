36,"2017-05-17",2.1,"Reviewed from saved notes.
The appearance was a semi-hazy yellow color with a super quickly dissipating fingers worth of white fizzy head. Quickly sliding lace.
The aroma had a huge vinous/white grape quality about it, spritzy lemon/citrus sharp qualities, and light mineral water.
The flavor was sour through the vinous/white grape quality and over doing the entire base. Aftertaste was the same and so was the finish.
The palate was light bodied with too much sour harshness distracting the overall enjoyment of this beer. Carbonation was also a bit too much. ABV did feel fine.
Overall, another overdone beer by Anchorage. Not a true witbier and also one that I wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

36,"2017-02-16",3.4,"Poured from a Batch 1, May 2011, 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is light with some hints of wheat and light honey notes. Light citrus with faint pepper and coriander. Light pineapple and tropical fruit with hints of an earthy must. 
Pours a crystal clear, yellow straw color with a medium small, somewhat thin, white head that exhibits alright retention as it recedes to a thin film that lingers on the edges for a bit before disappearing. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor has a light sweetness with hints of wheat and honey. Light citrus notes with lemon and orange. Light coriander and hints of peppercorn. Some light tropical fruit and pineapple notes with hints of an earthy must. Some lingering honey notes and citrus. Medium low bitterness. Hints of chardonnay and oak. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied and a bit watery with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, Im not sure if its the age or not, but the beer is thin and the flavors and aromas are very muted. Its an ok beer, and clean, but it is lacking life.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Excellent - Brett funk dominates over a pale Witbier base. This is my kind of beer! I dont know how much I believe that 20 IBU, though: it feels a bit more bitter than that typically implies, possibly because of the astringency from the Brett. In fact, the flavours are more like a Saison or a Tripel, than a Witbier. Any way you slice it, though, this is a really good one. (17/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Likewise, I can pick out the chardonnay now that I know it was aged in barrels containing it, but Im not getting the oak itself. No coriander that I can tell, either. Its actually kind of bland. Well, it alternates between being interesting from the brett, to a watery blandness that Im not used to with well made examples of the style. Mouthfeel is champagne-level foamy.

36,"2016-01-09",3.9,"750ml bottle - $15.00 at Tasty Beverage Company in Asheville, North Carolina.

Appearance: Pours a pale yellow body with noted clarity and a near nil, thin white head.

Smell: Harbors a scent of shredded crustless bread, old lemons-n-limes for a soft citrus nature and a fair amount of buttery white wine with a vein of mild, salty funk.

Taste: Very minor maltiness, only hinting a little hay-hewn cracked grains. Very minimal sweetness. A little lemon, a little lime and a sip of white wine giving a bit of buttery oakiness and subtly minerality. Slight albeit growing spiciness settles on the tongue, hinting at the peppercorns and earthy coriander. A bit more floral, citrus on the back-half. Drying, floral with a touch of orange juice on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Lightly carbonated.

Overall: An easy-drinking, albeit less than typical witbier. Though, for ones money, youd be just a well served by a Jolly Pumpkin Calabaza Blanca.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Very soft carbonation, pretty close to being flat. Winey mouthfeel. Oaky. Dry and a bit puckering finish.

Lacto funk acidity, elderberry juice and lemon verbena allusions are topped with peppercorns in this dry and elegant wheat beer interpretation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sliver of foam surrounds the hazy yellow shine.
-The first sips are quite Berliner Weisse-like.
-The aroma is a combination of crushed peppercorns, lactobacillus and lemon peel.
-The spicing dosage is intelligent, like it always is for an Anchorage brew.
-Yet another compelling brew from Anchorage. This guy can do no wrong, it seems.

36,"2013-08-03",3.6,"Batch #2, March 2012.
Appearance: The body is clear with lots of carbonation present in the pale golden body. The head is short with mediocre retention, settling into a thin white coating.
Aroma: The aroma leans dry and tart with lemons, leather and straw being prominent with sweet orange and an earthy presence taking a back seat.
Taste: The intro is of slightly tart lemon backed by crisp wheat. The mid presents slight tannins with dry leather. This leads to a bit of a seltzer water finish that is rather abrupt.
Palate: Light bodied with high carbonation.
Overall: This is a great beer, but its lost its brightness I experienced as short as 6 months ago. This is batch is over the hill, but its still a good beer. I wouldnt pay $15 again for this batch or anything older though.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Brettanomyces sourness mixes with oaky chardonnay, lemon zest and coriander to create an unusual but appealing aroma. It is quite sour up front, with some apple skin notes and a hint of spice. Smooth oaked chardonnay leads into witbier spice and black pepper in the body. The finish is more typically witbier, with the lemon, coriander and pepper showing through, but there is a little sourness to shake things up. This is a long way from being a standard witbier; the brettanomyces and chardonnay barrels have made it a very different, but highly enjoyable wit.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

It pours a light clear yellow with a big foamy white head.

The smell is skunky amlost, definitely some sulphur notes, reminiscent of Meteor Wit. When you take further examination you get the brett. It is in there with the oak and wine providing some reprieve from the skunk. A lot of vanilla in there.

The flavor is more straight forward but odd too. There is a buttery maltiness that really mixes with the oak and produces this woody buttery pretzel flavor. There is bitterness here too that mixes with the brett and creates some astringency. 

This beer is just a terrible mash up of flavors.

36,"2012-08-22",3.0,"Batch 2: Pale yellow. Foamy, big-bubbled head noisily crackles as it mostly diminishes. One-dimensional nose is chock full of tropical-fruit wine-barrel extractives (nectarine, coconut, lemongrass, spicy oak), bretty pineapple, lactic acid, and white pepper phenolics. Vague ""mousy"" character coincides with some sulfur and straw, as well. Flimsy, seltzery carbonation. Rounded brett-derived twang is lightened by coconut-laden oak and prolific tropical fruit succulence. Poignant lemongrass and zesty tannin oak sharpness curb some of the slicker, more buttery chamomile notes which, along with a raw woodiness, stifles much of the potential luster. Fleeting crackery, toasted wood malt is dry and ghostlike, but fairly fuzzy and poorly defined. Very hollow at the core. Predominantly flowery hops merge with the ongoing softness which is prolonged by honeydew melon. Finishes with a glimpse of white pepper sass though predominantly buttery and obscurely marked with oak and nectarine. A deceptively ordinary beer with bells and whistles. The oak and brett unfortunately do little to enhance the witbier profile, which, IMO, has its inherent limitations to begin with. Vigorous swirls toward the end of the glass reveal a sterile and characterless base beer beneath the myriad tropical fruitiness, thus it comes off as a one-trick pony.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Finally, the taste was light, sweet, and not at all what I expect.  A very weird oddity for shizzle.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AndyReynolds"
36,"2012-08-02",4.1,"A steady pour into my small St. Sebastiaan tulip produces a fat-one-finger thick, pale, just off-white colored head. The beer is a pale gold color that shows a brilliantly clear, super pale gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a nutty woodiness to it, a pine like character somehow, or perhaps it is just a huge herbal note, sweet fruit aromatics of golden raisins and ripe melons, a peppery woody spice character, as well as a solid fresh cut wood / oak note. Earthy spice notes of coriander are here as well, but this is a subtle base note that is quite well done; there is quite a bit of citrus character here, is it the Sorachi Ace, the lemon zest, or the coriander, likely it is a combination of all three. The hop character is well integrated, and also contributes a soft pine note as well as some subtle menthol notes. There is an oral nasal musky, musty, Brett like note that is more noticeable as an aromatic note after taking my first sip.

The flavor has a musky, musty, smoothly phenolic, signature Brettanomyces character to it. This melds well with a dry, citrus zest character, a soft earthy spiciness, and a wheat derived spiciness as well as tartness. The beer itself also has some other tartness to it, though the totality of this is at a fairly soft level. The beer has a light bitterness, but this definitely has a bite to it, and is just a bit more characterful than is found in your typical Wit. The body of this brew is exceedingly light, yet it somehow doesnt seem thin or washed out, though it is missing the traditional wheat-derived chewiness. The finish sees the Chardonnay barrel making itself none; notes of coconut, melon, lightly spicy fruit notes, some oaky astringency, and a toasty woodiness boosts the complexity of this beer considerably, yet retains a supporting, well integrated role in the overall flavor profile. As the beer warms up it seems to pick up a fullness that is wrapped up in the oak, and to a lesser degree hop, astringency. Adding the yeast produces a roundness, and softening of the hop character, while bringing out a touch of rubbery yeast character and a champagne like nuttiness.

The oak / Chardonnay character is just fantastically well done in such a light beer; it doesnt overwhelm the beer at all and is just one side of the interplay of yeast, spice, and malt character.  The carbonation could be a bit more spritzy, but in truth it is well in line with what it should be for a Wit, for some reason I prefer a higher than normal carbonation in a well-made, complex Wit, which this beer certainly is. I really like how restrained the earthy, dirty, coriander character in this beer is; Anchorage either used a quality variety of coriander (that focused more on the citrus side of coriander), or they used a very restrained hand. In the end this is just plainly a fantastic  Wit; I am certainly a sucker for these, and this one really hits the spot. The only thing I could ask for is a bit more tartness, from a historical perspective this is quite the tartness could be here, and in fact is preferred for me; that would put this beer over the top; I do feel that this is nit-picking just a bit in a Wit of this caliber, as there are very few versions that I would rank higher than this (but this is also somewhat a departure from the style, given its Sorachi Ace character). The Sorachi Ace hopping though compliments the citrusy / lemon character that is traditionally found in a Wit, but there is an added herbal and bitter dimension that just works so well in this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
36,"2012-07-28",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2014 Bottle at the CBC Tune-Up, London. Youre welcome, chaps. Pours very pale, lightly hazy yellow with a fine, white film head. Lovely nose of grass, light manure, brett. Nice flavor, medium sweet with zesty brett, some lemon, mild musty basement. Medium bodied with fine, smooth carbonation. Fresh finish, with mild zesty citrus and some light grassy bitterness. Utterly drinkable. Super clean and fresh, mellow but very complex.

36,"2012-07-26",4.5,"The beer pours a slightly hazy, pale straw-yellow body topped with a tall but fragile frothy white head that collapses upon itself leaving moderate lacing down the sides. Has a glowing, ghostly look to it. Aroma of hay, sweet wheat, lemon zest, spruce, oak, cedar, funk, and light tartness. Love it. Background has a distinct brett smell: mix of some funky barnyard smells with a hint of green apple sourness and oak as well.
Lightly tart and quenching, finishes dry. Lemon pith, herbaceous notes from the hop varietal, smooth with a light spiciness that lingers, but subdued in the background.  Reminds me more of a Saison than a Witbier. Citrus and wheat, tangy and quite drinkable. The Sorachi Ace hops really add nicely to the lemon profile.  It finishes with a beautifully smooth vanilla oakiness. Light bodied, with a slightly sour nature  that puckers the tongue. Overall though, this is a delicate feeling ale with mild carbonation. Overall, this is the most original take on the Witbier that Ive tasted. I love Saisons so this ones right in my sweet spot. Im really impressed with this first Ohio offering from the Anchorage Brewing Company.","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

36,"2012-07-11",3.8,"750ml bottle, shared during a family dinner. Minimal white head. Mildly hazy yellow color. Pretty continously ascending little bubbles in the body. Bits of slowly falling lace. This is the most interesting take on a Belgian Wit Ive ever heard of - with Brett, and aged on oak barrels? Also probably the most expensive Ive had, too. Nice light fine soft carbonation, dry finish. Its a really nice complex aroma. Orange-peel, peppercorns are noticable in the aroma, but its nice and subtle - the brett is more subtle than I expected too, appropriate for a witbier. Its a really nice tart taste, light sour. Doesnt taste woody, but theres a note of chardonnay. All of these gimmicks work pretty nicely together. Very nice zesty taste. Hazy on the last pour, with a nice white head, that fades a bit. The price is a bit too much for me to do more than once. For that reason, I wanted to dislike this going in, but Ive got to admit, it impressed me. Very nice to sip, and very interesting.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
36,"2012-07-11",4.6,"In short: A complex and refreshing funky session wheat beer that defies categorization.  Fantastic
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed six months after purchase.  Bottle forwarded to me by oakbluff, thanks a lot Scott
The look: Partly cloudy yellow-straw color body topped by a small white head
In long: Nose is truly farmhouse. It has a clear bright bretty character that is not too intense and has funny notes of parmesan cheese, lemony meringue, wet white wine barrel, more  Taste is insanely refreshing but the beer does not compromise on complexity.  Fresh slice of low-sweetness homem lemon pie with a nice meringue, plenty of fresh crisp wheat, kiwis and other exotic fruits, coriander, freshly squeezed lemon juice, nice white cheese, light notes of white wine, funk, astringent wood barrels.  And I could go on an on Body is juicy and with a lot of small tickling bubbles.  One word that best describe all the flavors of this beer (an there are many) is bright.  I LOVE each and every Anchorage beers but Im really surprised that the Whiteout is currently my favourite.  By style alone I would have suspected the Saison or maybe the Galaxy or the Tripel.  But no, their wheat beer is my favourite.  But with such alive beers, a lot of it depends on when you drink them.  This Whiteout is truly a desert island beer, certainly not the most intense beer out there, but so complex and so drinkable that I could imagine drinking only this beer for the rest of my life.  Fantastic beer that I need to keep in stock at home

The flavor is almost exactly the same- oak, chardonnay, wheat, lemon, funk, spice. Light-bodied, with a funky mouthfeel and low carbonation.

Definitely getting the buttery brett element up front with plenty of wheat backing.  Ive got some oak as well, but the brett seems to be masking what little coriander I do get.  Lightly acidic lemon pulp and zest round out the aroma.  The acidic pulp actually gets a fair amount stronger as it warms.  The flavor does have a more lemony component, but with just a tinge of the acidity (not much compared to the warmed up aroma). Still has lots of brett, getting a bit barnyardy, but even more butteryness. Pretty low on the sweetness.  Semi-dry finish, scant bitterness.  Moderate prickly carbonation with a light body. Not too bad, but this is the one I liked the least from Anchorage, and would not buy again at 2/3 the price.

36,"2012-03-17",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2012 Location: 750 ml bottle from Buy Rite, 3/17/12


Aroma: It has a pretty interesting nose of wheat, brett, lemon, citrus, and wood

Appearance: The pour is a cloudy, unclear golden-white, and a bright white head and good lacing

Flavor: Tastes mid sweet, a fairly heavy brett component, a good amount of citrus, and a little wood

Palate: The body is fairly light, slightly smooth, a bit of a tingly feel, and a fairly heavy bretty feel

Overall Impression: 
This was another great one from Anchorage.  Ive really enjoyed everything Ive tried from them.  This was another good one.  It had a nice feel, and the brett worked really well with the rest of the beers components.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

36,"2012-03-11",3.6,"Bottle from Best Damn Beer Shop: Poured a glowing white/yellow hue that hazy and was topped by a thick lather of foamy head that eventually fizzes out.   My nose detects a sour and spicy strain of Belgian yeast that reminds me of Flemish sour ale, but there is also a scent of coriander and a strong aroma of wine too. The flavor is tart with a heaping dosage of spicy Belgian yeast and Chardonnay wine. There are plenty of spices such as coriander, pepper, lime leaf, grains of paradise and etc. however, I dont taste the most typical Belgian white beer flavor which is orange peel. Certainly, much stronger in spices than was expected and the French Oak Chardonnay over compensates by creating a monster witbier, but I wasnt taken back by this recipe.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

A little funk in the aroma that showed up big time in the flavor, and not like a Brett funk that I really enjoyed at a mderate level, but this was off putting funk that really took away from the overall quality of the beer.

Pours cloudy, bright yellow with a thick white head that leaves a thin layer of even lace.  The nose is very dry and funky with very light malt, classic witbier orange peel and spices, and a malolactic Chardonnay character.  The flavor is similar, extremely dry with spices, orange peel, and the same fruity and lactic Chardonnay character from the nose.  The body is light with lively carbonation and a long, very dry, funky, and oaky Chardonnay finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
36,"2011-11-10",3.7,"Pours a slightly hazy, pale golden yellow color with visible carbonation bubbling up and a two finger frothy, pillowy white head that slowly settles into a thick cap/ring. Large streaks and chunks of soapy lacing are left behind. 

Earthy aroma with lots of zesty spice along with some musty, bretty funk and vinous light fruit. Lots of peppery spice, lemon zest and coriander followed by bready yeast, musty brett and light fruits. The barrel presence is there but the Chardonnay is more prominent in the nose than the oak giving off hints of grape, cider and pear. 

Medium bodied with soft carbonation and crisp effervescence up front that linger over the slightly funky, sweet vinous body into a slight dry finish. Theres a good amount of zesty spice, bready yeast and light fruit but the flavor is dominated by the Chardonnay barrel character. The spice profile has hints of pepper and coriander as well as a boatload of citrusy lemon zest that is complimented by the dry brett. The Brett provides some nice dryness and faint funk but doesnt overpower the other notes. The barrel presence kicks in mid-palate and really dominates the flavor through the finish. Theres only subtle toasted oak adding to the dryness but the Chardonnay character is very prominent giving off sweet vinous notes that balances things out. Lots of sweet fruit notes, especially light grapes, apple cider and pear. I would even say that its a bit too strong taking away slightly from the other elements. Still, this beer is flavorful, very complex and easy to drink. 

Overall this beer could use some balance to counter the Chardonnay sweetness but is still pretty impressive. Another solid offering from this up and coming brewery.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

This is light and refreshing going down; more body than many other Wits Ive had, but lighter than the aroma had me thinking.

36,"2011-09-15",3.9,"750ml bottle.  Batch #1 from May 2011, aged about 4 months in the bottle.  A careful pour reveals a hazy, pale golden-straw body strewn with effervescing streams of pin-point bubbles.  A moderate head of snow white foam is built on those pooling micro bubbles, slowly subsiding to a thin outer ring with a wispy film at the center.  Lacing is comprised of a dense, hard drying, patchy ring that coats nearly the entire glass.  Gorgeous looking brew.The aroma is a melange of complimentary elements.  Starting out, there is the clean wheat grain base, lightly sweet, hinting also at creamy oats with a drop of floral honey.  Brettanomyces is instantly recognizable, imparting a dusty, earthy bite that matches the subtle peppercorn and coriander spicing nicely.  Lemon pith adds a dry acidity, while Berliner Weiss-like lacto notes lend slightly eggy, sulfuric underpinnings.  Then there is the Chardonnay barrel influence, which comes in the form of creamy French Vanilla oak and soft kisses of honeysuckle or pear.  The nose is well structured, complex, and varied.  In terms of style, it is very difficult to pigeonhole....and I like thatThe flavor is very similarly structured.  Right off the bat, the dusty, slightly tart brett imparts an earthy, woody bite.  Coriander and white pepper transition closely behind, intensified by lively, fine carbonation.  At the mid point, the creamy, honey-kissed wheat pushes through, bringing with it a slightly more acidic and brite lemon note.  Barrel influence seems more woody and less fruit driven, as I dont quite pick up the orchard fruit that the aroma suggests.  Likewise, the lactobacillus tendencies present in the nose are a bit more subdued, yet still present on the finish, especially a few seconds after the swallow.  Overall, it remains complex, challenging, and tasty.In the mouth, the beer does not disappoint.  There is ample substance from the wheaty malt base, with just enough sugar to give it a respectable body.  It exceeds the weight of your average witbier, yet remains well shy of some of the awful ""imperial wits"" that were so popular in 2009.  Carbonation is persistent and cleansing, accentuating the spice elements up front and then wiping the palate clean of the residual sugars on the back end.  Each sip begs the next.Overall, I was quite impressed with Gabes first solo commercial offering.  It defies classification, evoking the spirit of Orval, Calabaza Blanca, and Temptation equally, while simultaneously defining itself as something completely unique.  Im excited to see what is to come as he tries out some styles that I am more drawn to.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

36,"2011-08-14",2.8,"It pours a cloudy, milky olive-yellow with a fuzzy burst of white head.  There is little to note in the aroma other than a hint of malts and something vaguely zesty.  The body is light. The taste was pucker-up tart with grapefruit or pineapple flavors and a thin hop bite at the end.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
36,"2011-08-14",3.8,"Soured wit, kind of like the lady of the woods from cisco. Nose is a bready and dairy (milky). Light body and light souring, pleasant.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
36,"2011-08-13",4.3,"Pours clear light yellow with a normal sized white head.  The aroma is very complex with lots of things going on.  Some of the notes I get are vanilla, oak, lemon, pepper, spice, funky yeast, wheat, smooth citrus, chardonnay, butter (in a good way, not diacetyl) and light banana esters.  The aroma is wonderful.  Medium body that is smooth and lush with a modest amount of sharp carbonation on the finish.  The flavor begins with lots of evidence of the barrel aging with vanilla, oak, grapes, apples and butter.  After that the sharp wheat is apparent along with the pepper and coriander - the wit aspects blend very well with the barrel tastes.  In the finish the brett character shows through with some funkiness along with some more apple and nectar fruits.  There is a tartness that goes throughout the beer as well, but it is not too pronounced or overwhelming.  When the yeast is swirled and introduced into the beer it is a bit richer and fuller version of the initial pouring.  A unique take on the wit bier style that works like a champ for me.  Massive thumbs up for this one.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
36,"2011-08-12",3.3,"750ml bottle purchased at the Davis Beer Shoppe. Aroma is very funky with some Brett and cheesy notes, too. Light vinous oaky notes are also present. Super funky. Mostly hazy straw colored body with a medium white head. Starts tart with some lemon, before this takes on some harsh Brett and lacto character in the middle. Plenty of wine character here with some woodiness and light vanilla from the barrel. Finishes light and refreshing. A little heavy on the Brett, though.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

36,"2011-08-06",4.5,"Bottle from SL. Hazy yellow pour, nice head and lacing. Aroma was bret, wheat, coriander. The flavor followed, really nice dry bret aspects, grapes and funk emerging too. Mouthfeel was full bodied for a wit! Enjoyable, up there with the better JP brews like it.","","User37895"
36,"2011-08-05",3.5,"Bottle from Beer Revolution. Pours light golden with a pretty white head and a vinous aroma. There is a dry wheat flavor with a sour oaky finish. Leaves a white wine flavor on the palate. This is a very unusual witbier but is pleasant to drink.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
36,"2011-08-05",4.0,"Solid wheat flavor base with a nice tart orange/citrus character.  Some mild bret character, but only mild.  Some pepper and coriander.  Solid effort.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
36,"2011-08-04",3.6,"Picked this bottle up at Whole Foods on P St. NW in DC. Served in a Mikasa tulip.

Pours a cloudy semi-bright yellow color with a good two-finger white head. The nose is a bit bready with a slight sulfur character; it smells a bit like a fermenting berliner weiss. Behind that is a bit of coriander and citrus plus faint earthiness. The flavor is wheaty with a good citrus character and a good earthy presence. Mouthfeel is the best aspect with the barrel character and Brett really coming through for a nice body and dry finish. Well done and a fantastic summer sipper. A bit pricey for what it is, but if this were in six-packs for $10-12, Id be drinking it all summer long.

36,"2011-07-31",4.1,"750 c&c from The Davis Beer Shoppe in Davis, CA. Opened with a soft puff. Pours hazy light gold with a creamy white head. Aroma of lemon juice squeezed in the barnyard. Near med body. Flavor is definitely brett/barnyard. Thinks theres a bit of light vinosity and oak. Certainly astringent. The flavor is really good. Its not super strong, but its really good. I think the brett moved the wit towards saison. Definitely a dry finish.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
36,"2011-07-31",4.4,"OMG! This one was a total surprise. Bottle at Paradiso Dupont, shared with RJ, Charles and one other dude. Cloudy yellow, medium white head. Aroma has serious barnyard funk and horse sweat, as good as any geuze Ive had. Taste has harsh sourness, citrus, pepper, hay and salt. A total shock, and Avery unique combination. No idea what happens when this one ages, but I intend to find out. What a great choice for a first easy coast release!

36,"2011-07-27",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2011 750ml bottle. Thanks again to Todd for sending this our way... Pours a clean yellow haylike crisp pour, lightly hazy, and topped wth a fluffy milky white head... Aroma is white wine grapes, a lighter dough like lemony quality to it with an added sense of refreshingness. Not too much from a tart or sour aspect to it. Sweeter oak profile persists and is apparent... Flavors are mich of the same with a semi-sweet citrus wit profile while some late addition of white wine qualities surface. Somewhat doughy nature and a hint of earthy tart dryness on the backend. Softer bodied and quite drinkable all around.  Would like to have a few of these to see the Brett character take hold.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
36,"2011-07-27",4.1,"Bottle.    Aroma of nice floral white wine grape rustic grassy wheat.   Taste is bright, zest grassy lemons,  wheat,    earthy toasty bitter wheat grass.   Sessionable.  Tasty.  Liked quite a bit.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
36,"2011-07-27",2.7,"750ml bottle thanks to largadeer.  Slightly hazy golden-yellow color with a small white head.  The aroma is a little strangely funky with some sunscreen, oak, pineapple, and brettiness.  Maybe a bit vegetal.  The flavor is better, although theres a bit of Coppertone sunscreen.  Also pineapple, coconut, chardonnay, and oak barrel.  Medium-bodied and dry with average carbonation.  Overall, not great.  Maybe with some age this could mellow out a bit, but for now its probably more useful to spread on your skin for a sunny day at the beach, as the SPF is no doubt pretty high.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
36,"2011-07-25",4.0,"Bottle from Beer Revolution. To call this a witbier is a bit misleading... and I mean that in a good way. This is really a straight up American wild ale/sour whatever you wanna call it.  The pour is very witbier like however. Very light, cloudy yellow with a large fizzy white head. The nose is very bretty with buttered bread, pepper, coriander, funky manure, vanilla, lemon, wheat.  Flavor is luxurious with lots of florals and spices, tart lemony, phenolic brett in the finish. Nice vanillin notes and tons of chardonnay. Not sour by any means, but very wild. I was left wanting a bit more sour flavors to complement the funk and spices, but thats not what this beer is. The brettanomyces lingers in the back of the throat as the manure, buttered bread and spices waft through your senses, backed up by the tropical, woody, toasty chardonnay notes. I really liked this a whole lot and am looking forward to more from Anchorage. It would be interesting to see how this would  taste in two years.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
36,"2011-07-24",4.3,"750mL bottle, purchased at Whole Foods - Coddingtown. Pours a beautiful, bright yellow color with brilliant clarity; huge, fluffy white head with great retention and lacing; awesome-looking pour on this. Delicious, lightly buttery Chardonnay notes and soft, toasty brettiness in the aroma; nicely dry, and a peppery and coriander wit character layered underneath; mouthwatering; a multi-tiered onslaught of yum. Medium bodied; high, effervescent CO2; lots of toasty and lightly buttery (in a good, non-diacetyl sort of way) Chardonnay notes first and foremost, taking me back to those earliest days of RR Temptation; lightly toasted oak, some citrus character, and a rounded, peppery witbier lurking underneath everything; a beautifully rendered beer, probably the first new beer Ive had in maybe six months that makes me damn excited about whats to come. Excellent stuff. Modest finish: slightly iodine-like note at the end, bitter yeastiness, nicely dry.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
36,"2011-07-24",3.8,"Bottle (batch 1, May 2011).  $14.99. Hazy golden body with a pretty, medium sized white head that lasts and gives great lace. Aromas of candi sugar, citrus peel, coriander, tons of white wine, chardonnay, oak, tannins, brett c, tropical fruit, esters, honey suckle, vanilla, gardenias, floral and perfumy. Flavors of straw, grainy, gardenia, vanilla, oak, floral, brett, funk, flowers. White wine. Very nice! Lively bubbles, dry, tasty, medium bodied.

At $15, Id still buy this again decently often. A truly amazing first beer; looking forward to any and all things Anchorage!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
