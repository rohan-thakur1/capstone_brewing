1809,"2017-04-15",4.5,"Pours opaque dark chocolate brown with a good tan head. Aroma features tones of molasses, roast malt and chocolate. Flavor echoes the aroma while tossing in some toffee. Mouthfeel presents firm body and peppy fizz. Logically Byzantine.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1809,"2017-04-04",3.6,"500 ml bottle via trade. Pours a deep, dark, opaque brown with a finger of soft, frothy tan head that settles into a thick ring and just a wee bit of film around the edge of the liquid, attached to the ring. So this is definitely showing a hint of tart dark fruit, which sucks, because the rest of it seems like itd be great. Candied nuts, marshmallow, coconut, chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, oak, mild roast - the sour fruit is subtle, but its there. Finishes with a big, sweet warm boozy note, and just a wee bit of the off note underneath it all. Full-bodied, with moderate carbonation. Man. Fuck. This wouldve been a classic, I can just tell. Which redeems this, because even with the off note, its not bad. Oh well. I hope they do it again so I can get a good one.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1809,"2017-02-19",4.0,"From bottle @ Uiltje bar, thanks Patrick Verhoeven for providing these! Black color. Dense light brown head, not much. Aromas: bourbon, sweet, pistachio, vanilla. Retronasal its bourbon, pistachio, sweet, alcoholic. Flavor is very sweet, sweet stout, honey. Rather full bodied, sticky and oily. Quite low carbonation. Long finish, the pistachio getting stronger. Very nice, if you can get past the sweetness. Good dessert beer.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","PotjeBier"
