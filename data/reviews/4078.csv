The second member of a world class flight compared well to the previous Raphael. Taking the sour experience in a different direction, it demonstrated why Panil is one of the only Italian breweries I am willing to pull the trigger on. Give it a shot if you somehow exhaust the Belgian list of unblended lambics or just want something different.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze semitransparent base rests below an ivory head. Sheer legs release waves of sharp blue cheese, vinegar, and acid. Funky and bright, it has a residual aroma of caramel.

Flavor / Palate - A fluid caramel base binds together honey and ranch dressing. Oak, sour cream, vanilla, and malt vinegar work together in a way that defies all logic. The profile of this particular lambic sets it apart; rather than trying to imitate its kin from further north it carves out a unique niche.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Head is initially large, frothy/creamy, white, fully lasting.

I wouldnt really call this a lambik just as far as how it looks, smells, and tastes, but its an enjoyable sour ale nonetheless. Sadly, theres not a lot of aroma, and it has a rather ""fresh"" quality thats somewhere between a Belgian blond and a generic sour ale. In the mouth theres a fair bit of bitterness to match the sourness, so its quite dry, but theres just enough residual sugar to keep it drinkable. Big frothy, lasting head looks nothing like lambic, but I cant deny its beautiful. Nice mouthfeel too, very velvety, not as fizzy/cracklin as most lambic. So, yeah...on the fence about this one. Quite nice, but not worth the price.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Au niveau des saveurs, les notes mordantes de blé et le citron font bon effet.  Les notes lactiques refont surface et prennent une vigueur certaine.  Des pommes vertes coupantes se joignent à leffet du fût de vin français.  En bouche, je peux aisément dire que le liquide fabrique un assèchement sans pareil.  Il y a une fraîcheur dans ce mouvement docilement brutal.  Les tissus sont attaqués mais ils se complaisent et finissent par en redemander.  En finale, les notes remplies dacidité et de fruits ensoleillés me laissent dans un certain état dappréciation.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

4078,"2012-10-24",3.6,"750ml bottle (BierKompass.de)
Very pleasant slightly sour aroma, a little cantillon-like, giving me some pleasant woodiness, a touch of citrus, and some white grape and apricot sharp fruitiness. Pours a slightly hazy peach, with a large brief spongy head. Slightly watery palate, but refreshing, carbonation crisp at first, but the palate is a little unsatisfying. Taste has the citrussy sour base, again a bit fou-foune-like, but sharper. Later as the carbonation disappears and the glass warms, the simple bready base comes out more, and its very pleasant, quite soft. Theres also a touch of yeastiness that accompanies the citrussy sourness in the finish. Was a better beer than the movie. Sourness was clear but restrained. Well made and certainly very tasty.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

4078,"2011-06-01",3.7,"Incredibly sticky large white foam remains dense on the glass as the level goes down and this makes for a spectacular showdown over the dullish cloudy pale golden hue. Very surprising nose, certainly wild and countryside-like with refined oak notes, but surprisingly agressive medicinal phenols that become tiresome after a whole bottle. Speaking of which, that unlabeled 750 ml bottle is beautiful, all in feminine curves and pretty much the 750 equivalent to the curvy Orval smaller bottles. Nice stuff although that is not so surprising from an Italian brewery. Back to the beer, it showcases a confident, refreshing citrusy character that fits the countryside cereals nicely. Attenuation is of course stellar, the beer being dry all throughout and despite that feature and the low alcohol level, it feels rather nourishing and filling, never feeling thin, I was surprised to learn this is lower than 6%. So all in all, we have a fun and relatively complex tannic ale loaded with farmy and lemony character, but a bit intense on the phenols. There is nothing quite like it, so its an achievement in todays wide-spread brewing world, but I cant say I appreciate it as much as Divinale for instance, their other attempt on the wild side.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4078,"2011-04-14",4.3,"In short: An intensely rustic blonde ale of some kind.  Dry, citrusy
How: Bottle 750ml, split three-way.  Mega-thanks to Fred82 for hooking me with this gem after I screwed up our order of that very beer
The look: Cloudy yellow body topped by a small white head
In long: Superb strong rustic nose, this is not lambic-funky, this is just intensely rustic.  I often use my own description of walking in a countryside field, but rarely has it been more true than with this beer. Taste is loaded with hay and dry wheaty cereals (light sensation of Shreded Wheat), some citrus fruits notes and that omnipresent rustic yeast character.  I suspect the not-so-high ratings on this one is because it is classified as a Lambic.  This is obviously no lambic.  If I was to compare Panil Divinatale to one beer it would be a Jolly Pumpkin Weizen Bam, only less funky but more rustic (if that makes any sense).  This is one fancy high-priced beer that I would love to session.  It is very expensive but I will buy more bottles if given the opportunity because I have a great investment strategy.  With the economy going down and homelessness on the rise, Im investing my money in shopping cart manufacturers.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Appearance : Light hazy yellow. Light lacing.

Aroma : Great citrusy tartness with nice light funk. Some wheat and malt.

Taste : Very citrusy and tart with nice malt and light funk. 

Overall : Ok, granted this is not that close to a real lambic nor is it as complex but this is still a really tasty brew. I really enjoyed the intense citrusy notes and the great tartness. It sometimes felt like a blend between a lambic and a berliner weisse (you get the picture ?). Funk is very light but present. This was very drinkable and refreshing.
