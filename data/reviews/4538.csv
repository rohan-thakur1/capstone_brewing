4538,"2016-10-26",3.8,"Half-liter glass stein at the 2016 Urban Chestnut Oktoberfest. It poured a clear straw colour with long-lasting white foam and lace. Super grainy Pils malt traits, faint marshmallowy sweetness, earthy, black peppery noble hop balance. Light body, crisp and husky mouthfeel, medium-high carbonation, full-flavour but then a bone-dry finish. An extremely true-to-style Czech Pils and delicious example of style. Highly recommended.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
4538,"2016-09-07",3.7,"On tap. Pours a nice golden color with a fluffy head with lacing. Aroma of citrus, light fruit with a trace of sweetness. Taste of citrus and light fruit with a subtle malt sweetness. Easy bitterness and a clean finish. Fairly light body, crisp and clean feel, very refreshing. Hit the spot.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
4538,"2016-08-22",3.6,"Bottle at Culmination Fest 16: Poured a golden with a white foamy head. Aroma is nice grain and grass, mild hops. Taste is dusty lemon, light sulfur, grain. Very summer refreshing, even on a rainy Alaskan weekend.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
4538,"2016-06-17",3.8,"Pint at Cuginos. A fluffy white layer of foam over this golden beer. Leave it to this brewer to send a middle finger to convention. This is a really good version that begins with big citrus flavors. Mid glass European hop sulfur emerges and the citrus backs off only to reappear at the finish. A hint of funk with some earth and spice. I like it a lot. Certainly not classic, but this is 2nd Shift.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
4538,"2016-06-16",3.3,"Tasted at cuginos. Nearly clear. Crisp. Sweet tart sweet then becomes dry. Easy drinking.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
4538,"2015-12-19",3.7,"750mL bottle pours a slightly hazy pale golden with a small white head. Aroma of grassy hops, Pils yeast, and dry bready malts. Upfront mildly resinous grassy hop bitterness, dry yeast, a slight malt sweetness, and finishing dry and bitter. Pretty solid Czech Pils!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
4538,"2015-12-03",4.0,"Hazy gold pour with a massive rocky white head. Nose is grass, grain, pils malt, faint funk, flowers. Nice crisp grassy hop bite, saltine cracker malt. Medium bodied. Tasty and a good Midwest take on a Czech pils.","Kansas City, Kansas, USA","justsayswell"
4538,"2015-09-14",3.9,"750 ml bottle from dbsdelight - thanks again, Dan! Pours a lightly hazy gold that leans toward the yellow end of the spectrum, and has a big frothy white head that settles into a frothy cap that lasts all the way to the end. Notes of grape must, pear, barnyard funk, straw, cheesecloth, copious pils malts, straw, grass, and sawdust. Medium-bodied, with medium soft carbonation and a frothy, funky, zesty mouthfeel. Delightful. Drinks bitter than a typical Czech pils because it has what Id describe as a Missouri wine country funk character to it. You need to try it to understand.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4538,"2015-09-02",3.2,"Pours a mostly clear light golden with a white head. Light aroma of dough and grassy hops with some minerality. Taste has some light herbal and grassy character, light cracker malt with minerality and hint of sulfur. Light bodied with moderate/high carbonation. Nice Pilsner with a little more body than I’ve had in the style but still very good.

The taste was medium sweet with spicy/grassiness and bread/cereal. It finished with some light metallic and a light to medium body with some crispness. Nice.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
4538,"2015-07-02",3.4,"Pour is a clear straw yellow with a large white head. Aroma is everything you would expect, dry cracker and bready malt with some grassy hop. Flavor is more of the dry cracker like malt and the finish is a nice herbal hop. Maybe a bit thicker and heavier than some pilsners but this still has everything you are looking for. Very spot on and tasty pils.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
4538,"2015-06-23",3.7,"Sampled at Boulevardia 2015. Comes a pale gold with a decent white head. Aroma and taste of malt, fruit, grain, and grass. Very crisp. Excellent, especially on a hot day.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
4538,"2015-06-19",3.8,"Pours pale light yellow with modestly sized white head. The aroma is pretty malty with a bit of sweetness, light dough, trace of lime and an herbal hop hint. It has a crisp body with a bit more girth than many pilsners. The flavor starts with drier malt with a bit of a cracker aspect, grass, sulfur, spice and leafy herbs. The finish is bond dry, quite herbal and refreshing, Excellent pilsner.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
