1190,"2017-04-14",3.5,"9.5%ABV. Double IPA.

Poured out light amber. 12SRM.

Nose is pine and spicy with cilantro and scallion.
Sweet nose suggesting nice clean malty body that is full bodied and syrupy. It gets me in the mood to taste some big hop flavor.

Mouthfeel is syrupy and soapy. Palate is malted candy, corn syrup. hops are pine, pine sap, citrus peel, citrus oil.

Finish is medium with a lingering citrus oil flavor.

Overall, one of those sweet malt, dry hopped affairs for me. I dont hate it, but my palate at the time of this review wants to have more bready heft which means more body, this sweet has not much body which means you get a 2 track tasting, big hops and big sweet malt and nothing to fill the void in between.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

The flavor profile is quite outstanding. Alcohol is covered, balance is world class and complexity is fair. It begins with a rush of sweet pink grapefruit that lingers through the finish. The middle has a moderate bitterness that is rind based and the hop flavor shifts more towards classic grapefruit.

Frothy and dense, egg-white, very moussy head leaving thick cobweb lacing, residing over a clear orange blonde beer with quite vivid sparkling. Dank, powerful, tropical fruit aroma hitting the nostrils with impressions of tangerine, fresh mandarin, pink grapefruit flesh, toasted sweet onion, overripe papaja, cedar needles, Grand Marnier, strawberry wine, cake, sweet cherry tomatoes on toasted bread, roasted pine nuts, lavender, sweet curry, cantaloupe, lychee, freshly ground black pepper, sweet white grapes and Pineau de Charentes - the kind of DIPA bouquet I could sniff for hours, as each time I put my nose to the glass, something else shows up only to disappear again and make room for yet another impression. Clean onset with perfect balance of sourish and sweetish (mango, lychee, melon, blood orange) adorned with certain umami aspects (green olive) and in perfect balance with a soft, yet finely tingling carbonation, softly minerally; bitter and lightly salty hops are palpable right from the start. Middle phase continues these impressions on a very supple yet robust, caramelly and honeyish malt sweetness while the hoppiness increases, working its way to a big finale in the finish, deeply bittering without becoming abrasive and exploding into a wealth of retronasal citrus peel, pine resin, roasted onion, tropical fruits and spices. It still allows for juicy, sweetish malts to pass through, while a warming glow of bourbon-like alcohol reminds you of the fact that this is still imperial (double) IPA rather than ordinary IPA; the bittering and utterly aromatic hop effect lingers after that, fierce and very elegant at the same time. A hop-soaked masterpiece in many ways, I can easily see how this scores so high on the DIPA scale. Firestone Walker has done many a great thing in its history regardless of the takeover by Belgian Moortgat, and this is surely among those great achievements. This is to double IPA what Sucaba is to barley wine or Parabola to imperial stout: extremely well crafted, with a flair for taste, power and sheer beauty. Exemplary double IPA in all respects, I absolutely love this, this must be among the best in its style I had so far. Fantastic.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Jamais je nai senti autant de mangues, de fruits de la passion, de clémentine et dananas à la fois. Un véritable punch tropical! Les houblons napportent pas quune dimension fruitée à la bière mais aussi une quantité de résine importante. Les saveurs sont pour moi moins tropicales que les arômes. Je suis plutôt du côté sapineux et conifère, le tout dans un enrobage collant au fond du palais.

The smell had a sweet sticky grapefruit-esque leading to fine subtle juicy citrus and decent underscore of pine to balance.
The taste was pure bittersweet and refined to a sly subtle sticky citrusy conglomeration of pine. The aftertaste was mainly bitter that lead to a slightly dry finish.

Completely surprised that my local grocery store began carrying this, because quite frankly this is the type of store that caters to swill drinkers. Not to look a gift horse in the mouth (what an odd saying), I bought this and Speakeasys Double Daddy and enjoyed a Saturday evening at home. 

So, the beer pours out a brilliantly clear, golden yellow body, tight bubble stream and airy, light 1-finger white foam cap. Aroma is just a beaitiful display of fresh hop goodness. Juicy grapefruit abounds with a stunning showcase of fresh, floral hops, minimal malts and some showing of alcohol. The hops continue to pound the senses on the palate, with an onslaught of ripping, shredding, grapefruity hops. I havent had a palate wrecker like this in quite awhile, and it was a pleasure to consume. The malts seemed to relish in taking a backseat to the hops, which also seemed quite alright with being the star. So easy to enjoy and so easy to recommend. I think its a stellar example of a classic West Coast DIPA and couldnt suggest this one enough. Kudos to Firestone Walker!! Job well done.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

*Glassware: IPA Tulip


*Serving: 22 oz


*Aroma: citrus, grapefruit, pine, tangerine, tropical fruits


*Appearance: Pale Amber with a four finger head. The head has tons of fizzy big bubbles. The head color is off-white. It slowly receded to two fingers of head. Lots of carbonation streaming up to the head is probably why it stayed the way it did. After consuming the beer, a minor amount of lace was left behind.


*Taste: Sweet malt upfront, citrus/grapefruit in the middle, and finishes off w/ a pine taste.


*Palate: Medium body, oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation on the tongue. Finishes off very dry and bitter.

1190,"2014-09-07",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 4-7-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a beautiful crystal clear orange amber color with tons of big carbonation bubbles initially seen streaming up through the body of the brew getting enveloped in the one finger white head. The large carbonation bubbles quickly fade from view with all the while the white head fading to leave a decent level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell - The smell is big of a sweeter grapefruit hop aroma. A ruby red grapefruit and tangerine aroma combine producing a hoppy and sweeter citrus smell overall. These are not the only aromas however and are joined by some lighter pine and herbal hop smells as well as a nice tropical fruit smell of pineapple and papaya.

 Taste  The taste begins very big of malt and sweeter fruit flavors as well as a nice grapefruit hop taste. The fruit flavors are mainly of a tangerine and pineapple flavor initially, but as the taste advances some flavors of a slightly sour lemon come to the tongue mellowing out the fruit sweetness more toward the end of the taste. While the sweeter fruit lightens, the taste still remains relatively sweet as some caramel flavors come to the tongue in the middle of the flavor profile. Toward the end of the taste the grapefruit picks up in intensity and is joined by some pine hop flavors as well, with the combination of flavors leaving a nice moderately resinous and grapefruit bitter but still somewhat fruity and sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is thick and smooth with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. The thick and chewy body as well as lower carbonation are fantastic for the combination of sweet citrus fruit as well as citrus hop flavors, bringing them to the forefront on the tongue. 

 Overall  A very enjoyable and smooth tasting double IPA that hides the 9.5 % abv very well. It has a nice blend of citrus hop and sweet fruit flavors but also has enough balance via the pine, caramel and malt flavors to produce very easy drinking and robust tasting IPA.","","Darkmagus82"

1190,"2014-07-04",4.9,"When a brewery is able to craft an Imperial IPA thats intensely hoppy and still extremely drinkable its a rare feat. The fact that Double Jack utilizes some extremely aggressive hop varieties (Warrior, Cascade, Amarillo, Simcoe, and Centennial) makes its balance even more impressive. The tremendous malt backbone on this beer allows it to reach a happy medium between malts and hops. (Regrettably, I almost used the unforgivably cheesy term ""hoppy medium"" to describe the balance. Ill go sit in a corner for a while.) You first notice the uniqueness of this beer when you see the surprisingly pale color. Hopheads who are thrown off by the appearance will be calmed by the big herbal, floral smell. People who are less excited about hops will be happy to note the smooth malt profile in the aroma. The taste is simply spectacular. Tropical, juicy, and savory flavors all the way through. Hop flavors come with peach, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine while the malt hints at sweet nectar. Finish is crisp, bright, and refreshing. Double Jack is one of those exceptional IPAs that has the potential to please hop heads and craft beer lovers who are less crazy about bittering agents.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

This was bitter and earthy as hell. Not too enjoyable on my part. Flavors lingered. Alcohol kicked me in the balls. Bitterness stabbed me in the eye.

Taste is initially sweet and hoppy and the transitions to good bitter ending. The beer has a rather thin mouthfeel, not surprising based on the clearness. There is a slight ""cooling"" sensation on the tongue at the end, made possible by your friends at 9.5%ABV. A very nice drink, all around.

The all-hop nose is friggin bursting with peach notes, along with incredibly accentuated citrus and pine notes. It is dry, yet the aroma of caramelized malt appear on the palate up front, followed by pine notes, and the mid-palate is dominated by the citrus which has been turned to grapefruit notes by the bitterness; while the bitterness stays, bright fruity flavors like pineapple, peach, and apricot appear and stay well into the finish, which is dry, long, and sprinkled with a faint hint of anise.

A: pours a honey colored ale with excellent clarity and a single finger white soap-sud head to form and dissipate in a couple minutes, leaving a broken quilt of the same. Spotty-on-webbed lacing.

T: Sweet, citrusy, sweet and more citrus. Very big (even after two months in the bottle). Not much bittering hops - or at least balanced in favor of the sweetened malts. ABV near invisible here. Well crafted. Wonder how nice it is fresh (within a couple weeks). Slightly soapy on the finish.

M: Medium-light body with moderate carbonation. The beer washes back easy and leaves a slick, resonous layer over the tongue and palate. Nice.

1190,"2013-12-19",4.1,"March 23rd, 2012 - Firestone Walkers Double IPA blends in handily with other mediocre beers at my grocery store, where the selection is withered and scant. Looking across the wide swathe of cheap beers in brightly colored boxes, its hard to pick out the bottles worth plunking into the grocery basket, but Firestone Walkers Double IPA is one. In fact, I had no idea this gem existed. Firestone Walkers beers keep showing up to graduate student gatherings, and while its fine for a round of board games and taking down your opponent a peg, its never caused me to put the dice down and really enjoy the moment. But the Double IPA is different. Oranges, jasmine and just barely overripe peach flesh develop an incredibly fresh and powerful bouquet. Meanwhile, a medium palate and nice carbonation - visible through the glass in this orange marmalade brew - deliver a thick, balanced blend of jasmine flowers, floral hops, graham crackers, roasted and caramelized carrots, and all of it made more vivacious and 3-dimensional thanks to a boisterous carbonation. A long aftertaste helps me enjoy each sip to the fullest. Suddenly I can see why this hard-to-see brew is so well loved.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Finishes clean and semi dry with a green piney bitterness. The aftertaste consists of sweet citrus and thin caramel.

M - Very smooth feel, medium chewy body, micro carbonation, very nice mouthfeel.

A well crafted beer indeed. The aroma and feel are the beers strong points. A solid dose of hop flavor with just the right amount of bitterness. Citrus overtakes the pine as it warms, the malt is steely and sweet but has a lightness to it as well as a high quality character. I love every beer Ive had from this brewery so far.

1190,"2013-05-28",4.1,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Double Jack is golden in color, with a little bit of a tangerine orange tint.  A sizable off-white head rolls up the side of the glass with the initial pour and leaves a nice web of sticky lace as the glass is consumed.

What I notice about the aroma is how well the different components come together.  Grapefruit citrus, resin, spicy pine, a bit of tropical fruit, and some light sweet malt notes come through.  The emphasis is clearly on the hops, as it should be.

The flavor is hop-forward as well with a subtle transition between the flavors.  At first some honey and pale malt come through, but that is quickly washed away by the wave of hop flavors.  Bitter grapefruit pith, orange rind, herbal notes, and spicy pine come through, with a bit of grassy bitterness and caramel sweetness right at the end.

How this beer feels on my palate is one of its strengths.  Not an overly full body, Double Jack is comfortable with a slightly fuller than medium body that lets the alcohol come through.  A gentle yet firm creamy carbonation mostly cleanses the tongue between each sip but leaves some hop residue as a reminder of the bitterness.  There is some residual hop oil and malt stickiness as well.

It took only one sip to be able to tell this was a high quality DIPA, and I expect nothing less from Firestone Walker.  Although I appreciate the nuanced bitterness and well-crafted nature of this beer, my true favorites are recklessly bold and do not impart much subtlety.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1190,"2013-05-19",3.6,"A great imperial IPA, arguably one of the best there is. I will take this beer over a Hopslam, Hopwallop, Nugget Nectar, or anything similar, but I think that the style is overrated. The nose on this beer is one of the most recognizable Ive experienced (with regards to the Imperial IPA style, anyhow) because the drinker gets less citrus and grapefruit peel notes but a bit more pine and malt, which (thank God) differs from most imperials (which this rater contends pretty much all taste the same with little variation). As a server, if someone wants something hoppy, this is my go-to beer because it is damn good.","Washington DC, USA","max.shelton"

A very balanced malt note, straw and cereal-like, matching the pungent hop profile perfectly. The taste is amazing as well. Pungent hops all the way through, resting on a perfect and very simple malt foundation that has just enough body and crispiness to stand up to the assertive hop profile. The 9,5% dont show at all, and it is dangerously drinkable for the abv.

The beer appears hazy and light orange hued with an inch of dense, white head. Plenty of lacing coats the walls of the pint glass. The aroma offers some malty sweetness, as well as some hop and citrus notes. The flavor brings forth a huge helping of malt and candied oranges. Strong. Hop presence is there as well, of course, but the flavor seems dominated by malt, candied oranges, and a sweet presence throughout. Thick in body, even a bit syrupy. Alcohol presence is prominent throughout. Overall, an ok beer, but not my thing.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

S- All hops here. Lemon citrus and some faint floral notes... Mostly citrus though. Very nice.

T- All bitter hops up front, very bright citrus notes that give way to some sweeter floral hops in the middle. Not a ton for a malt backbone but enough to make me want another drink sooner than I should, given the high ABV. Finishes with a lasting, wonderful bitterness that youd expect from a big west coast IIPA. 

M- A solid medium body with perfect carbonation, not too oily but not too fizzy. 

O- Very good beer. Not what I expected out of a ""double version"" of Firestones Union Jack, a beer Im not a huge fan of. Not much for balance, but if thats what youre expecting, youre barking up the wrong tree here... Although I should point out that it isnt as much of a hop bomb as some of the other IIPAs from the west. I highly recommend this one for fans of the regional style.","Missouri, USA","FoizeyBeerDad"

1190,"2012-11-10",4.1,"22oz bottle, not sure how old it was but maybe a couple months? Nice light orange color, a little lace, short head. Smell was nice but not a super hoppy west coast like I was expecting. It had a touch of alcohol but mostly just had a really balanced smell, a little malt and a little hops. The flavor was very similar, I think I caught a bit of citrus but it was not hop forward at all. the alcohol was noticeable but didnt detract from the flavor. I was actually surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did because I usually only like west coast hop bombs (which this may be when its fresh). Overall this was a nice balanced beer and just reminds me that Firestone Walker makes solid beers.

1190,"2012-09-11",4.8,"Well, lets just start by saying that this is pretty much as close to perfection as a DIPA comes in my book. I have held my breath for about 3 years waiting to get a bottle of this and would like to thank the GBBF 2012 for getting this to our shores, and better still getting it here as fresh as possible. 22oz Bottle. Pours deep, warm gold with a copper/amber hue. Big fluffy white head which reduces to  decent covering a few cms high. Aroma is a big pine/tropical fruit fest. Comes on strong with the aroma of pine, hop resin, mango, tangerine, honey, flowers. It just smells the part, most of all the aromas are as clean as a whistle, no smudgy malt here, the malt is crisp as are all other aromas. Flavour enters on an equally resinous note with pine to the fore giving way to lovely tropical fruits, certainly with notes of blood orange, more tangerine, mango, and some nice citrus qualities as well. Its backed up with just the right amount of caramel and light toffee sweetness to balance the lovely hoppiness. The malt is of a soft and almost delicate honeyed style, just there to support the hops, its what keeps the beer so fresh feeling. Finish is all about subtle resin notes, a hint of earthiness which I think has crept in since the first bottle I had a month ago (how quickly our beloved hops begin to turn)  and classical citrus rind, grapefruit and so on. The reason I rate this beer so highly is its drinkability. This drinks like a 7.5% IPA. I hate when DIPAs become to chewy or thick and malt dominant. This is a true west coast expression and a monument to how to sculpt a great DIPA. This could have been stupidly hopped, but theres just enough restraint to make this a true class act rather than a novelty DIPA. Hats off to FstW. You guys rule. I have a 2011 Parabola thats been sitting in my collection for 1 year and a quarter, I look forward to it whole hartedly. Any hop head or appreciater of fine wares has to seek this beer out and drink it, I urge you, you will not be disappointed. Selah.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

1190,"2012-08-25",3.2,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2013 22 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a medium amber color with fantastic clarity. The head is a three finger white color thats textured beautifully, and retains itself quite well.

S: Its a typical DIPA aroma, with grapefruit, pine, and herbal hop qualities, but behind the hops is an underlying layer of sweetness, much like the draught version I had several months back. Fairly citrusy in general, which I always enjoy.

T: Initially, the flavors are citrusy sweet. Its far more orange-y than many other IPAs Ive had, and even evokes sucking on an orange slice. Afterwards, it reverts back to a more piny, peppery finish, with low to moderate bitterness. Also, the maltiness becomes less sweet caramel and more neutral breadiness. All good so far...

...except for one problem - its too boozy. It doesnt necessarily remind me of drinking straight up Orange Glo, but it comes across like 11.5% rather than 9.5%. The hop complexity of Union Jack is still there, at least. Take out the aggressive booziness, and this would be an easy 4, or even a 4.5, but as it stands right now, its disappointingly average. Positively, the booziness calms down a bit, being replaced with more piny, resinous hops near the bottom of the glass.

M: Im losing my patience with syrupy IPAs, and sadly this fits the bill. The finish is heavy handed in its sticky wetness, and the dryness of the hops fail to balance things out; but other than that, the mouthfeel is fine in terms of carbonation and texture.

O: There are some fantastic qualities here, but the harsh, boozy, syrupy nature of this beast really kills its chances at greatness. The best way to enjoy this is to drink it cold and split it with friends. Its worth a try - especially on tap - but it was a disappointment for me.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Appearance: Pours a clear light golden-amber color with yellow-orange highlights and a 2 finger fluffy eggshell head. Very nice lacing.

Smell: Sweet citrus with a touch of pineapple and grapefruit and hints caramel and candied malts. Theres just a whiff of alcohol in the aroma. Smells delicious.

Taste: Bitter grapefruit and caramel malt up front followed by resinous piney hops and a mild candied sweetness in the middle before ending with lemon zest and pine at the finish. Aftertaste is bitter with a touch of sweet citrus and is quite long-lasting. The alcohol is subdued and just creeps through at the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. The tongue gets coated with hop oils which leave a sort of film which, in this case, is a good thing.

Drinkability: Very good drinkability. Im savoring this one and will have no problem finishing the bomber. 

Overall: Excellent beer overall. Id love to try one that I know is fresh to be able to see if I missed anything. I found this one to be great, so if it gets better than this youre in for a real treat. Try it.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

1190,"2012-05-27",4.4,"Appearance: A gorgeous deep amber and super, super clear. Just amazing. This color knows what it is and states it proudly. Theres a tall three finger head that takes its time dissipating. Quite a time too.

Smell: Tangerine jumps to the front with orange and lime backing it up. Citrus dominates the aroma profile and its all the I can get to here.

Mouthfeel: Syrupy but carried extremely well by the alcohol and carbonation. Its refreshing but heavy. Its light but strong. Its delightful. 

Taste: Burning hops step to the top and like Hoptimum, you need a few sips before you can really start to judge the beer. Theres a distinct bready character that lies underneath helping disguise just how alcoholic this beer is. You really have to be careful with this brew. Lime and tangerine start to appear next and are helped along with a sweet, juicy fruit flavor. Almost like mango or passionfruit. Theres a very clean finish 

Overall: This only gets me more excited about the Sucaba barleywine sitting in the cellar. Firestone-Walker has impressed me on their first showing. Ill definitely be back for more based on this and I suggest any hop fans head out and pick this up. Not for the hops (theres hoppier stuff out there) but for the balance here. This is a really great Imperial IPA example and everyone should get a chance to enjoy it.","Anna, Illinois, USA","mtlasley"

Aroma: oranges, peaches, bubblegum, lemon, lime, hint of grapefruit
Appearance:  Very clear pout and 1 finger frothy off-white head that faded slowly.  
Taste: medium sweet, mild sour, medium bitter
Palate: medium body, thin texture, slick.  lively carbonation.  mildy bitter, sweet, and slighy sour finish.  Very light and crisp.  Refreshing.
Overall:  I like this.  More aroma and flavor than Union Jack.  Less bitter as well.  Surprised at the 9.5%, would guess closer to 7.5 to 8%.  This beer is very well balanced without being too sweet nor too bitter.  Will pick this up again and try to get a fresher bottle.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","PD4Ever"

The floral bouquet is endlessly complex and strong. Its a straight up IIPA with tons of citrus and evergreen. The hops run that gamut of citrus with a little rosemary and pineapple standing out. The malty sweetness is just a canvas except for the slightest biscuity note that makes things a little interesting.

Lots of citric fruits and caramel on the nose, quite piney too, resinous hops and faint herbal tones. Somewhat sweet orange and mandarin on the flavor, caramel, resin, pale malts and hops. The bottle is not that fresh anymore, though it feels a bit more balanced now, alcohol comes through a bit but doesnt disturb at all, hop profile is still very nice. Excellent.
65 cl bottle. Bottled on 18.11.2011.
Pours clear golden color with medium head. Aroma of exotic hoppy fruits grass, mild caramel notes and pine needles. Flavor of exotic fruits, mild grass and herbal notes, caramel, spices and grape fruit. A bit sweet but nicely hopped and crisp.

I drank this back to back with its little brother Union Jack (or I guess Single Jack).  Basically the same thing, just stronger.  The Union is 7.5%, this is 9.5%, which is about 25% more.  I would say that sounds about right for everything they just turned it up a bit.  Not sure if its good enought to justify 2x the price though.  Not a knock on this, but more of a credit to little brother.

The aroma is certainly to style for American IPAs, but its remarkably one-dimensional.  Resinous green hops not much else.  The usual suspects in the mouth, too...citric, astringent, and quite bitter.  This doesnt really do anything wrong, but its the same as hundreds of other American renditions.

1190,"2011-08-23",3.3,"August 13, 2011 - bomber from lagerloather shared with MesandSim, Reakt, Nate2g and others.  Am I finally understanding why so many Brits hate crystal malt?  Because I was stunned by how underwhelmed I was by this beer - how most of the British-made IPAs I had during my trip blew this out of the water, and none of them used crystal malt....hmmm.   Anyway.  Bright, slightly hazy amber-gold with a smallish frothy/creamy beige head.  Aroma is quite sweet, a bit boozy, herbal, resinous, pungent and weirdly medicinal - barely a 7.  Taste is okay, but underwhelming, a real caramel character to the malt, it distracts from the solid dry somewhat characterless grapefruit bitterness, and that earthy, medicinal character intrudes as well - blue basil? - whatever, I dont care for it much;  a bit boozy too.  Sticky mouthfeel, undercarbonated, longish bitter finish, sharply herbal and pungent (yeah, basil .... why, FFS?).

The nose is very fragrant, very citrusy and spicy; lots of pepper, white grapefruit and faint passionfruit, some green hops, leafy hops, and a slight honeyed malt background.  The flavor is similar but turning a bit herbal (maybe basil, as the description suggests?), still grapefruit and tangerine, pepper everywhere almost chile pepper-esque, some honeyed cereal notes underneath, and a nearly high bitterness.  The palate is nearly lively, nearly full, creamy, sticky, and oily.  The beer finishes with the peppery spice almost seeming warm, bitter herbal notes, slight resin, and similar citrus notes still keeping from a dry IIPA.  My first experience with Firestone and I was pleasantly surprised.  Very different from other IIPAs, lots of peppery spice but minimal dryness, a pleasant malt base but still a nearly high bitterness, and very high herbal notes but still quite drinkable.  The palate worked very well for me with just enough carbonation and body as well as a mixture of mouthfeel textures that was just nice.  I am surprised by this one, the citrus calmed the intense pepper, the pine/resin notes were minimal which kept the dryness low, and somehow the herbal notes only added nice complexity.

1190,"2011-08-01",4.2,"I poured a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass.Appearance: Initially a very hazy, bright orange complexion. Forms a fairly large, white, frothy head that retains and laces very well. As I get towards the bottom of the bottom the beer becomes completely transparent and more red (Ive no idea why, though).Smell: Strong, sticky, syrup-like scent of mango, guava and papaya with some grapefruit juice. Flowes, pine needles and spiced rum are also quite prominent.Taste: Its rare that I encounter a beer whose palate is a combination of intense richness and bitterness simultaneously. Double Jack hits the tongue like pure tropical fruit juice concentrate or preservatives. At fridge temp this taste is actually very refreshing and lightly sweet. Strong bitterness follows immediately thereafter. Its sticky pine and resin combined with a liquor-like dryness. The tongue is saturated with the juicy sweetness and the hoppy bitterness - which makes for a very strange, but satisfying, sensation. As the beer warms the fruit flavors become richer and sweeter, tasting more like pure honey, maple syrup, or fruit extract. The bitterness remains about the same, but a rum-like spice begins to take hold as well. Its definitely a lot for the palate to handle, but because its so tasty its difficult to stop drinking.Mouthfeel: Full-bodied in all aspects - thick, sticky mouthfeel with a palate thats always intense. Whats amazing is despite the intense palate the hops do not linger here, giving the beer an amazing clean finish with no cloying, drying aftertaste.Drinkability: The only thing keeping Double Jack from being a perfect beer is the fact its a sipper. Even at fridge temp I found it difficult to drink more than a sip at a time. The sweetness and bitterness overwhelm the palate with a slight alcohol warmth on the throat. I guess this is to be expected considering its 9.5% ABV, although I have had even bigger beers that were smoother. This would probably be an ideal beer to pair with a hearty, spicy meal, but as a beer within itself its still enjoyable - but drinking more than one serving is challenging. Overall, Double Jack is one of the most impressive double IPAs Ive ever had. And while I wouldnt consider it a perfect beer, I understand where its reputation comes from.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The floral nose was perfectly balanced and was very inviting, with notes of citrus and hop resin.  I also got a slight hint of malt, bread and yeast.  The body was really smooth and extremely drinkable.  This is a very dangerous IPA, as you can barely sense the alcohol content in this.

3.5 A: Clear medium orange color. Two fingers of white, creamy/frothy hybrid head. Average retention and a moderate amount of lacing.

4.0 S: Piney and citrusy hops. Tropical fruits including orange, mango, pineapple, and papaya. Malts are slightly bready with a fairly strong neutral maltiness underneath. Clean overall.

4.0 T: Hops flavor is like the nose. Lots of tropical fruit - mango, pineapple, papaya, and orange - with light pine and grapefruit. Surprisingly low bitterness. Moderate neutral maltiness, fairly bready, and maybe a bit of biscuit in there as well.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. I wish this was a bit creamier though. Smooth.

4.0 D: Good beer, but its in a weird state between a dry, hop-bursted west coast DIPA and an east coast malt fest. Surprisingly bready for a non-bottle conditioned brew, but clean.

She would often put on an LP of Louis Prima after she had bathed and oiled her magnificent frame and would go about a posing routine while we enjoyed fine Ale and the smooth sounds of the great Louis Prima. While this beer is powerful, it does not take away from the wonderful fruits and hay like flavor that this beer delivers.

The aroma had moderate to heavy cookie, caramel, sugar, candy; lighter molasses; moderate to heavy resin, citrus, orange, tropical fruit and earthy hops; a little maple syrup; and alcohol. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and light to moderately bitter; while the finish was rather sweet and rather to heavily bitter with a long duration. There was caramel, tropical fruits, apricot, citrus, tons of caramel-coated fruit, a perfect blending of sweet and bitter; toast, cookie, candy, candied tropical fruit, and definitely some grapefruit tang at the end.

In long: The very hoppy nose is full of citrus fruits with a focus on grapefruits.  Taste is mostly about the hops.  A solid bready malt backbone with a fresh baguette flavor.  Some white sugar (crystal malts?) and only a tiny bit of honey and caramel.  Hops are dominant with plenty of grapefruits/citrus but also a lot of fresh and dry grass.  Very clean and crisp.

Body is full and creamy with initial caramel candy sweetness and balanced by a truly imperial hop profile.   Dry hopping really is key here-- the aroma is far stronger than actual hop bitterness.

Pour was a nice medium gold with a one finger off white head. Taste was all west coast IIPA. Strong, bitter grapefruit rind and citrus hops are in the front and not leaving any malt in to balance out the bitterness. Medium carbonation keeps the beer lively.

Getting more rum soaked pineapple and peaches.  Less rounded or full in general.  

Less yeast characteristics which added body and complexity.  Love it still but not as much from the keg.

Bottle Review

Aroma: ripe pineapple, alcohol, pine, citrus hops

Appearance, crystal clear orange/amber, tiny bubbles

Taste: Malt back bones carriers the agressive pine pine resin and tropical/citrus hops.  On the back of the tongue a cheesy yeast comes out late.

Palate: Alcohol and spicy hops attach front of the tongue early and dry/cool it late with a long astringent finish...even though my mouth is pretty much coated with the sugars.

Tons of citrus, though maybe light on pine (which is no problem). Certainly a bit sprucey, but nothing overpowering. Crisp, but ever so slightly syrupy, just dings the palate a touch.

As for the flavor it was what I expect in a west coast DIPA, hoppy bitter with a light malt sweetness. Again the flavor is tilted towards the hops so the hop head in me was quite pleased it was crisp and clean in the mouth making for a really enjoyable brew to drink. I will be grabbing another bottle when I see it fresh again.

Pours a dark golden orange/copper color with burnt orange/tangerine hues when held to a light and a half finger white head that slowly settles into a thin ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.

Medium bodied with a slick oily hops mouthfeel. Dank, dry and resinous with some nice bitterness that is quickly countered by a blast of sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Lots of grapefruit flavor with hints of mango, apricot and orange peel. This is countered by earthy, bitter pine needle flavor and a strong boozy presence. Subtle malt backbone with hints of biscuit and toast. As it warms the alcohol really starts to shoe and begins to dominate the flavor, making it a bit tough to drink down.

Pours an unbelievably clear amber with a thick creamy beige head that shows great lacing and sits as a thick cap for the duration.  Again, the clarity of the body is really striking.

Aroma is full of citrus in the form of pineapple and pithy grapefruit.  But there is also a big resinous pine character - a great combo overall - with some light sweet malts.

The taste is more of the same and really, really hoppy.  But, when I say hoppy, I dont just mean bitter, as the bitterness is present but not overpowering, I really mean just great hop-driven flavor.  Its got an initial pine kick but the grapefruit and mango bring some fruitiness to the taste.  The light caramel malts keep things from getting too out of control, but barely, as this is a seriously hoppy beer.

The mouthfeel is actually on the lighter side of things for a DIPA but has good carbonation and the tingly hop bitterness ensures the body never seems watery.

Another home run from Firestone Walker - right up there with PtE for me with all the right hop characteristics.  Its ridiculous how easy this drinks for a 9.5% DIPA.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Aroma of freshly squeezed grapfruit, papaya, mango, orange peel, soft piney resin, and subtle, sweet hints of caramel and vanilla. The body is not thin, but rather loose and roomy; it supports the juicy citrus and pine flavors quite well, whilst also coating the tongue with sticky sweet nectar.

Fairly intoxicating aroma, luscious and rife with sweet, toasty malts and massively floral and fruity hops, along with suggestions of grapefruit, orange, melon, pine, honeysuckle, light caramel, faint dough and brown sugar, some very faint alcohol lurking beneath the surface to spice it up a bit as well.  Light copper color, clear, with a lasting head of uneven white bubbles, leaving a sheen of lace behind.  Flavor is hugely malty and hoppy, with all the complexity shown in the nose, featuring a very rich malt character, overlaid with massive amounts of fruity, piney, fresh hop flavors and bitterness, which blend with the nascent alcohol and ultimately manage to outweigh the thick, gently toasted malt character with just the right degree of dryness.  Huge and lasting finish, this itself features as much complexity and degree of development as some lesser beers entirely  (is that bubblegum, peppery spice and pineapple?).  Mouthfeel is quite hefty and thick, but again is assisted by the drying effects of the hugely generous hops, warming, showing a moderate degree of effervescence and a very full body.

1190,"2011-04-02",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2014 What can I say?

The most complex, fruitiest DIPA Ive ever tasted, and the fruitiest unfruited beer Ive tasted since Stille Nacht 1996 Reserve. Among the detectable fruity esters, there are grapefruit, mandarin orange, tangerine, peach, plum, agave nectar, cherry, mango, kiwi, lemon, lime, marion berry, and strawberry.

The finish is luxuriously long, and that seltzer quality slightly dries out the finish, and really adds a sprightly tingle.

Add to this a great malt backbone that has a fruitiness all its own with a substantial body (similar to Hercules, but not as syrupy and weighty).

The floral hoppiness in this beauty almost rivals the Plinys, and after awhile a seltzery saltiness develops, and while Im not normally a fan of seltzer, it works perfectly here, and leaves one craving another taste.

Delicious nose. Pineapple and tangerine. Hops are nice and fresh and the malt is forward enough to give it very good, sweet balance. Carbonation is too low, giving the mouthfeel a smooth but heavier than desirable texture. But the overall balance of the palate still makes it pretty easy to drink. Piny/grassy hops and just as sweet honey malt flavors. The hops are crisp and bright enough to lend some lightness to the beer but the malt profile is nearly as big as the hop. As such, it doesnt come across as bitter as you would expect and has an uncommonly clean finish that features very little in the way of resiny hops.

The smell is fuckin incredible, it is orgasmic. It has the smooth scent of tropical fruits and citrus, pure hops.

The flavor is much more resiny with both pine and citrus rind. There is some dankness and some tropical fruit too. It has a ncie bitterness, not ultra-high, but up there. The malt is a perfect backing giving off a subtle sweetness but not overpowering the hops.

This is one glorious, glorious beer.

AROMA: Citrus, floral, cantaloupe, pine. Very clean, balanced, robust, and delightful. Faint hint of resinous hops and wet hay on nose as well. 


TASTE: More hop-forward (ie, less balanced) than aroma. Pine, citrus, resinous hops. Some floral/honey-like malt sweetness. 

Finish is more flavor-hop focused than excessively bitter. Bitterness and its duration are on the lighter side for the style - which I prefer.

Subtle graininess on finish as well.

Very nice, juicy, fruity complexity with some light pines and florals alongside the soft herbal spice. The malts are fairly sweet with some honey, a touch of biscuity grain, and caramel. Flavor seems to lack some of the hop depth I was expecting, but is still quite nice. Lots of tropical fruits, grapefruits, and candy oranges with a sweeter resin. Medium pines and herbal pepper, but could use a bit more complexity IMO. The malts are again sweet and well rounded with some honey, grain, and caramel. The hops do dry this nicely with a medium, somewhat sticky, peppered pine bitterness that leaves a lengthy aftertaste. Medium, silky body and soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a really nice DIPA.

1190,"2011-02-08",4.1,"Super fresh 2011 bomber.  Pours a clear, dark golden color with a fluffy, yellowish-beige head of foam.  Slowly disbursing, the head becomes a thin center film with a pronounced, foamy edge.  When allowed to settle on its own, the head leaves dense, tattered sheets of tapestry lacing all over the glass, completing the attractive look.  In the true west coast tradition, the nose is loaded with juicy citrus hops, ranging from biting white grapefruit, to sweeter tangerine peel and freshly bloomed orange blossoms.  Theres a dry pithiness, but also sweeter citrus oiliness, countering one another beautifully.  A touch of fresh basil lends a green, herbal element, as do hints of grass and maybe a dash of pine needles.  Malts are prominent, yet sufficiently dry, hinting at light English biscuit that has been cut with a hint of galletas (Cuban crackers).  They provide a moderately sweet background that seems a perfect marriage for the abundant, juicy, resinous hops.  Flavors follow suit, again amply hopped and citrus driven, booming with bitter grapefruit, tangerine skin, naval orange, and even a touch of lemon rind.  Pine plays a backup role, as does herbal green grass.  Countering malts are lightly caramelized, coming across as more toasty and crackery than biscuity and cookie-like.  Still, theres the perfect amount of sweetness there to take the edge off of the substantial, biting hop profile.  The beer drinks lighter than its 9.5% ABV would suggest, towing the line between ample body and relative dryness, with moderate, unobtrusive carbonation throughout.  In short, this is a great beer.  Firestones limited releases continue to impress, and this one is right up there with the best of the Anniversary series in terms of a total package.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Tropical fruity hops invade the aroma with notes of pine, florals, and light herbs.  The flavor mostly follows that with big juicy tropical fruity hops.  Grapefruit, orange peel, and some lemongrass seem to stand out.  A hop bomb for sure.  This is a little on the sweet side, especially for a west coast IIPA, but with ample bitterness its fine.  In that regard, it kind of resembles some of my favorites from the midwest.  A little alcohol heat sets in towards the finish although it tries to dry out a bit here as well.

1190,"2011-01-21",3.7,"Snifter on tap at Jake Melnicks (Chicago, IL). Pours a glowing dulled amber gold hue, touches of fiery orange saturate the body, light haze, some darker influence with a cakey offwhite head atop that turns to soap, a decent head sticks atop and laces well. Aromas are big blasts of tropical hops, citrus moves into the fold, big grapefruit and mango, peach and pale and caramel malts. Biscuits and bread are overwhelmed by big Simcoe. Aromatics rue the day, as this is a very juicy beer on the nose. Initial is heavier end of medium bodied with a huge juicy fruit presence, mango and peach pair with more huge tropical hops, grapefruit and lemony citrus, not the most bitter beer, as alcohol and nice pine and florals provide bitterness on the backend. Maltbase is sweet, sticky biscuits and toffee, bread and pale malts creep in, but a heavier beer is needed to pick up all the hops flavors, a big Simcoe bomb in my opinion. Soapy and dry bitterness cling on the backend with lingering bubblegum and mango, big juicy fruit. They werent messing around. I think the aroma is rich and powerful, and a great hop. But frankly, the hop complexity on the palate is a bit tame and unkept. Sure there is tropical hops, but where is the bigger bitterness to back it? Soapy and tropical, moderate bitterness for the size, but a bit too sweet for me overall. A nice IPA that preaches that tropical and bubblegum blues.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Pours an extremely clear slightly lighter than copper brown hue and crowned with a lasting fluffy barely off-white head... Aroma is big on a lychee type base which I dont get too often but one that reminds me of  the homeland (along with the sweeter syrupy base that u get with canned lynchee). For some reason those notes quickly fade into a mostly citrus hops and a pineapple juice sweetness. Not sure what happened there... Flavors, however, dont promote that same sense of nostalgia for me. Hops are present but not very distinguishable due to the heavy emphasis on caramel malts and a pervading sweetness that goes along with it. A light bittermess in the finish but not all that muh when all is said and done. Body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. Generally a little too sweet for me. That and a heavily boozey finish hurts its enjoyability for sure.

The hops and sugars combine when first cipped to make a vegetal sensation on a syrupy body.  It still had a nice bitter citrus and resin hop bite on the finish that lingered nicely.

1190,"2010-12-23",3.8,"Sampled on tap at 1702, Tucson; December 2010
Arrives from the tap with a hazy, gold copper hue and it is topped by a frothy, almost one finger thick, pretty long lasting, light tan colored head that manages to leave some nice lacing on the sides of my glass.  The aroma smells nice and hoppy with concentrated notes of lychee, tangelo and kumquat zest that is backed by a little bit rougher notes of essential citrus oil.  The nose is definitely expressive, but manages to be smoothly hoppy with out the sharper focus of pine and herbal notes often found in the style.

Oh yes, hops indeed, it is likely sucking on sweet hop nectar; definitely sweet tasting from both the supporting malt character and also the ample fruity hop notes.  The fruitiness is so tropical and vibrant in character with huge notes of lychee, a sort of mango / guava thing, softer tangelo zest notes, ripe kumquat freshly zested with essential oil bursting forth, .  The beer finishes with a softly biting bitterness that is quite a bit softer than a beer with this much hop character usually is and there is a light, sort of green, lightly herbal hop note that is just suggested.  In the long finish though, there is a note that reminds me just a touch of garlic chives, though this is fairly subtle.  The body of this brew definitely has some heft to it with a viscosity that sticks to the palate as the beer slides across the tongue, the linger bitterness helps to was this clean after each sip though & this is definitely appropriate for a Double IPA, though I might wish for a touch more lightness in the body; still this is quite drinkable & truthfully the fullness from the residual malt sugar also contributes to the huge expression of hop fruit character that this beer achieves.  The malt plays a clearly supporting role, but the sweetness is definitely an important part of this character (and in truth much of the sweetness comes from interaction with the hops rather than overly residual sugar levels) and it also contributes pale biscuit / cracker like malt character that is at times noticeable underneath the hop onslaught.  

I am really enjoying the vibrant hop focus of this beer.  I really like that the nose is completely focused on this character and that the flavor has just a touch of bitterness and hop-herbaceous character to add a needed balance.  A definite pleasant surprise, for some reason I wasnt expecting too much from this beer, despite really liking fresh Union Jack.  At this particular moment the fruit focus this beer has is definitely quite appealing, though I could see this being a bit too fruity and cloying to some (even to myself under a different situation).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1190,"2010-07-09",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2016 My Bottom Line:
Citrusy hops galore sink into each honeyed malt pore, building a luscious, silky Double IPA with a levelled resinous bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the shiny golden amber. 
-The malts also offer light caramelization.
-Hops develop leaves, conifer needles and green peppercorns throughout.
-As in most Firestone Walker brews, the body is quite round and well polished; I really feel this type of mouthfeel works better in their stronger ales than in their quenchers.  
-Alcohol warmth swims within the plump body.

Caramel malts and mildly sweet without the punch I would have expected from a double IPA.  Rating #2 - Bottle (7 3 7 3 17).  A golden color with a white head.  A strong pine aroma with a nice floral finish.  The citrus undertones are somewhat overpowered by the intense hop aroma.  It feels light in the body but has a nice earthy flavor.  Much better the second time around.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
1190,"2010-01-23",3.4,"For an IPA, this beer, made by the folks at Firestone Walker, lacks that comfortable mouthfeel that its peers have. Nonetheless, the hops, clearly headbutting each other in the glass, make you understand that this is a sharp India Pale Ale, with enough bloody knuckled bite to keep your mouth sealed to the bottle. Perhaps not as memorable as other, more character driven IPAs, this Firestone Walker recipe is a classy notch in craft brewing history. Definitely something I would order again.","San Diego, California, USA","BobbyAnalog"

1190,"2009-09-05",4.2,"Fantastic DIPA that deserves regular rotation. First, lets get the Union Jack comparison out of the way. Double Jack is smoother with more sweet caramel malt and hoppier with quite a bit more fruit flavor. On to the review... Double Jack pours a bright orange-yellow without much in the way of head, but its always difficult to judge head when the beer is too cold and on tap. The aroma is simply wonderful. Its a blast of candied pine, tangerines and grapefruit rind. The sweet malt is noticeable, but the hops are clearly the focus. The flavor is rich with hops, much like the aroma. The malt backbone provides good sweetness. Its well-balanced on my scale of DIPAs, anyway, which is to say not balanced but not quite as bitter as some. The flavor also imparts some other fruit flavors, apricots, peaches, other lighter stone fruits. I found the fruit flavors more varied and fuller than nearly any other DIPA Ive tried. The feel is round and strong without any cloying sweetness or bitter astringency. Drinkability is quite good for the size and style.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Flavor holds a bunch of hops, though the first sip seriously reminded me of the malt-balanced approach of Union Jack IPA.  There is, undoubtedly, a ton of flavor here.

This really is just concentrated Union Jack.   the malt is just a bit sweeter, the hops pack more of a punch, and the alcohol is slightly more evident, though still well concealed.   Its good, but Im already a big fan of Union Jack and this doesnt bring a whole lot new to the table.   I do appreciate all the effort it took to get such an intense hop aroma in there though.   Since it is not very widely available, I can see myself indulging when I get the chance, but I wouldnt pay more for it if it came in bottles on the shelf next to its little brother.   I think that FW has to start from scratch to make a winner of a DIPA.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Pours a brilliant reddish-orange that radiates from the glass and has a bubbly off-white head that dissolves into a swirly fine layer around the glass. The aroma is fresh citrus hops with some toasted malt in the background. The flavor is piney and citrusy hops upfront and is accompanied by some a nice touch of malt and finishes with a grapefruit bitterness. Its full-medium bodied and has a nice amount of carbonation. This beer absolutely blew me away. The aroma smells like a basket of hops and the flavor doesnt let you down. In my opinion this is far superior to my encounters with Pliny.
