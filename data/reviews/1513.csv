1513,"2017-04-30",3.9,"The looks of the bear arent worlds greatest. The color of the beer is a rather pale golden yellow, with a blurry haze. It is still clear enough to look trough it though. On top of the beer some rough white foam is formed. The majority of the foam collapses rather quickly, leaving a nice soft drape.
The smell of the beer is nice. The description fits the beer perfectly: hoppy wheat ale. The smell starts with a malty base, almost a bid hay-like. Quite fresh and fruity. Besides this there are some clear, very clear hops. I smell some delicious piney aromas, and some lovely bitter, but also sour and a bit sweet aromas of citrus fruits and zest. Nicely done.
The taste of the beer contains the same nice characters. Nice maltiness at first, balanced out by lovely sour and bitter fruity hops. The citrus is a bit stronger than in the smell even. Well balanced beer, that is full of flavour. NIce.
The palate is nice. Good medium body, smooth beer and a medium, even more to the lower side carbonation. The finish is nice and contains some lovely alcohol warmth and the taste of hops, starting quite fresh and fruity, to end rather bitter and dry. Well done.","Capelle aan den IJssel, NETHERLANDS","Gangstergafje"

1513,"2016-10-05",3.7,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, wheat, tropical fruit, hops and citrus.

Appearance:

Hazy/turbid yellow/golden beer with a slight white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, wheat and tropical fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops and citrus.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. A decent amount of tropical fruit thanks to the hops, which works great with the wheat based beer. Smooth and soft palate, contributing to the refreshingness of this beer. The appearance could have been better by being more opaque and having a larger head. The aroma is also not as intense as would be expected from such a hopped beer.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
