1025,"2017-04-08",3.9,"650ml bottle from Elizabeth Station. Vintage 2014. Pours an almost black with a dark beige head. Aroma is roasted malt, burnt sugar, some roasted seeds, little bit oily. Taste is similar with chocolate, dark fruits and bourbon notes. Chocolate and bourbon aftertaste. Quite boozy stuff. Aftertaste is the best thing that this beer does have in my opinion as the burnt sugar doesnt almost present there.

The base for this beer reminds me the base of Bellwoods 3 Minutes to Midnight and Skeleton Key. Though the burnt sugar has less presence here as it is, probably, hidden by barrel aging process.

1025,"2016-12-23",4.5,"2016 aged at 33 degrees shortly after bottling. Pours dark as a starless night. One finger of head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing. At 13.1% ABV, head characteristics are difficult to produce so an allowance shall be made and an outstanding score awarded.

World class complex nose of dark fruit (plum, raisin), bourbon, caramel, vanilla, molasses and subtle chocolate over a background of tobacco and oak. The nose is a rich mixture than blends exceptionally well then fades into the bold tobacco and charred oak background. 

Light full body that is substantial and almost achieves creamy. The high alcohol content produces a rich velvety smoothness that coats and flows across the tongue. Carbonation is light due to barrel aging, yet produces a noticeable effervescence in the middle and a slightly prickly finish. All things considered, the palate characteristics are quite outstanding.

The flavor profile is world class and quite worthy of this beers reputation. At first chocolate is light but gains in prominence through the experience. It never achieves dominance but lets its presence always be known - especially from about three quarters through. 

Bourbon is similar except that it peaks during the first quarter. In the middle lies the true richness of this beer. Dark fruits explode and then succumb to caramel and molasses bringing with it a solid sweetness as a contrast to the bold elements of this beer. These, in turn, fall to the bold tobacco and charred oak notes which are preceded slightly by a vanilla burst. The finish is a slow fade of blended flavor with tobacco, oak and vanilla lingering. Alcohol remains covered until a nice burn at the finish.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

At least theres plenty of sugar left behind to help soak it up, but that of course creates the problem of leaving a VERY sweet, sugary, syrupy beer. At 14% its pretty tough to have anything but that, I guess. Carbonation is low and engaging and helps to some degree, but this is still a monstrosity.

Nose shows more wood than bourbon but with a good roasty background that carries a subtle sweetness reminiscent of dark dark chocolate.

Flavor is immediately drier than the nose made me believe.. bits of vanilla and sweet cigar wrapper envelope waves of great complexities.. a bit boozy with warmth.. and the malts open up to be a bit sweeter as the temperature rises.

Many thanks to Kevin for the bottle.

Pours a black color, with a decent, bubbly head.

Aromas reveal a rich Bourbon note among chocolate, coffee and wood. The Bourbon is very well pronounced, hovering on top of sweet, toffeeish malts, bakers chocolate and molasses, well balanced between sweet, earthy and bitter aromas. Toffee and hot Bourbon blend outstandingly well into each other, with coffee playing a balancing role, bittering the nose. 

Drinks incredibly smooth, revealing the rich, decadent body of the beer, with almost no carbonation necessary to showcase its complexity. 

While the Bourbon is very prominent on the nose, it is well integrated into the beers taste, due to earthy malts, wood and creamy milk chocolate, balancing the bourbonic impact. It tastes quite hot though, with coffee blending into the oak incredibly well, exhibiting a slightly dry quality, absorbed by sweeter chocolate with lots of cream. The bitternes turns quite prominent, due to the wooden, hot bite, inviting matured hops and coffee to the tongue. Until the very end, coffee and chocolate are on par, leading to a semi-dry, slightly burning finish.

Fantastic brew, outstandingly balanced, while providing an amazing depth. Wooden coffee and creamy milk chocolate are balancing the Bourbon artfully, both staying recognizable until the finish, while their taste gets gently transformed due to luscious, slightly dry, warming Bourbon and notes of coconut, as well as vanilla.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1025,"2015-04-08",4.5,"The liquid is a deep, impenetrable, inescapable black that pours thick and viscous with a small, sudsy head the color of cinnamon. Some thin spots of lace pepper the glass as the liquid recedes while you drink. Take a whiff and youll pick up tons of toasted coconut, some vanilla, charred oak, and maybe even a little tobacco. Your next sniff might reveal espresso, high-cacao-percentage dark chocolate, or the subtle zing of spicy Hallertau hops. A night spent pondering Parabola is a lesson in the merits of restraint. A problem rampant among barrel-aged stouts is that they often let one flavor (whiskey, usually) take the reins and overwhelm the beer. Here, individual flavors are there if youre willing to look for them, but theres also a nice synthesis -- like a rainbow, with each flavor fading softly into the other. And what flavors are discernible are mighty fine: first is the darker, bitter stuff like cocoa nibs and espresso powder. Sweeter notes soon emerge, reminding of vanilla beans, toasted coconut, dark plums and cherry syrup. A gentle amount of bitterness (delivered by citrusy/woody Zeus hops) keeps this sweeter stout from becoming cloying. The mouthfeel is blissful, with a velvety smoothness not unlike a milkshake. I want to make a bed and sleep in it. Bubbles massage the tongue lightly and the beer fizzes up only very slightly as it moves. The brewers must also be commended for their skill in covering up the alcohol burn. This is 13 percent alcohol -- nearly liqueur-strength -- and I dont pick up a hint of it. The drinkability of this boozy stout is downright dangerous. World-class.","","PartyFowle"

1025,"2015-02-28",4.7,"Régóta várt jövevény, elegáns megjelenésű legenda a Firestone Walker csúcskategóriás imperial stoutja, mely fortyogó fekete testű szörnyetegként mutatkozik be, minden tekintetet magára szegezve, tekintélyt parancsoló módon nyilatkoztatja ki kimondatlanul is egyértelmű felsőbbrendűségét. Minden egyes mozzanatát mélyen az emlékezetünkbe véssük, kezdve kecses aromáival, melyek között hosszú órákra elidőznénk. Mértani pontossággal megtervezett illataiban elmerülve ritkán tapasztalt mértékű eleganciával szembesülünk, ezek azok a benyomások, amelyek szavatolják a további élmények feledhetetlen jellegét. A tölgyes és bourbon-központú jegyek puha étcsokoládé és prémium minőségű ízesített kávé hangulatát hordozzák magukon, minden egyes komponens mesterien visszafogott, ugyanakkor teljes mértékben rabul ejtő szerkezetben karol egymásba. A fás és amolyan finoman földes jegyek csodálatos harmóniában olvadnak egybe a csokoládés és alkoholos, nápolyis-csemegeszerű és tüzes malátás, egyszerre könnyed és markáns aromákkal. A varázslat azonban folytatódik, az első kortyok által nyilvánvalóvá válik, mit is kell, hogy jelentsen egy minőségi főzet esetében a tökéletes test. Olvadékony szerkezete mennyei mannaként tölti be szánknak minden egyes szegletét, olajos és pezsgően csípős keretbe foglalva zúdul ránk a folyékony csokoládé pikáns módon elkészített megannyi változata. Sötét tónusú vanília, tölgyfachips, kókuszos nyalánkságok ömlenek be szabályozott mederbe terelt folyamként, az édesség, fűszeres alkoholosság és tartalommal teli keserűség kibogozhatatlan egysége érzékszerveket gyönyörködtető módon tárul elénk. Egyszerűen lehengerlő az a fajta intenzitás és fajsúlyos karakter, amit mindenféle agresszivitást nélkülözve, az előbbiekben kifejtett módon hordoz magán a sör, ezáltal pedig szerény véleményem szerint mindenféleképpen az egyik legjobb, valaha előállított imperial stout.","HUNGARY","adster"

No head to speak of just a slight mocha ring around the top and virtually no lacing as well. Smells of, well, bourbon.

1025,"2014-10-14",4.4,"Transfer from BA review on 4-8-14-

 Poured from bottle into a snifter 

 Appearance  The beer pours an almost pitch black color with a one finger of cream colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass. The thickness of the brew can be seen right after pouring and when swirling in the snifter with thick fingers of liquid clinging the sides of the glass before slowly fading to the base of the beer at the bottom of the snifter.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer has tons of chocolate and coffee in the nose. Along with these smells are some wonderful oaky and bourbon aromas mixed with a good dose of caramel and vanilla sweetness. Some other lighter aromas of a more dark fruit nature are thee as well with smells of cherry, raisin and plum all there. Overall the aroma is big roasty and sweet producing a nice warming aroma overall.. 

 Taste  The taste begins with a massive level of roasty malt and sweet chocolate with a huge sweet caramel and vanilla flavor. Even from the start some bourbon and oaky flavors are detected on the tongue. While very sweet upfront, the beer incredibly gets even sweeter as the caramel ramps up and is joined by some brown sugar and a toffee sweetness with other flavors of lighter dark fruits of fig and raisin (light in comparison to sugar flavors; although by no means light). The roastedness and chocolate flavors fade a tad at the increase of the sweet. Some coffee comes to the tongue however and just like the sweeter flavors, the booziness and bourbon flavors get quite a bit stronger in nature as well. These transitions, with the massive increases in the sweetness and the booziness, all in the end, leave a big, massively sweet and moderately boozy warming taste to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both were fantastic for the darker flavors of the brew as well as for the huge sweet and alcohol flavors of the brew with the lower carbonation only accentuating these. With its boozy and oaky flavors in conjunction with the sweet and dark flavors of the brew the overall thick body and lower carbonation really make this one a nice warming brew and a nice slow drinker. 

 Overall  Big, robust, massively sweet, and warming. This is a nice imperial stout. A little sweeter then I would want on any real occasion, but this one makes a dessert all in itself, being quite nice for a capper to an evening after dinner on a cooler winter night.","","Darkmagus82"

Russian Imperial Stout
14% ABV

APPEARANCE: Pours a deep shadow black from a bright sunny day. Slight dark chiclayo rim variation. With a pillowy, creamy mocha head. 

AROMA: Ginger bread pudding topped with coconut ice cream drizzled with a bourbon caramel sauce. Hints of raisins, and heat from the high ABV. 

TASTE: Sexy and seducing layers that evolve in your mouth. Chocolate, leather, tobacco amazingly balanced with raisins molasses and bright oaky flavors. So delicious, just letting it roll back and forth getting more and more flavors each second. 

MOUTHFEEL: medium body with vivacious and enthusiastic carbonation that dances in your mouth. Some heat from the 14% ABV, that ends with a nice long finish that leaves the mouth coated in a oily sweetness. 

OVERALL: Very easy drinking and amazing flavor profile. Up until now the bcs has been the top of my stout list, this may have just knocked it off!

RATING: 5/5 Zombie Heads!

A - Pours black with a thin mocha cap. The head settles down and vanishes while leaving thick legs down the glass.

S - Massive roasted malt aroma, rich bready malts, Amish chocolate bread, caramel/chocolate, big nutty yeast, toasted coconut, vanilla, toasted graham crackers, cherries and other dark fruits come out as it warms.

T - Roasted barley, sweetened espresso, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, nutty brown bread, strong coffee flavored with coconut syrup. The bourbon is light but rustic with a scorched butterscotch character. Dark fruit emerges as it warms. The alcohol

M - Medium full body when cold but once warm turns to light side of medium body, thin but silky feel, the consistency becomes more syrupy as it warms. Warming finish with some bite.

A big and bold flavored beer that is far from boring. The yeast was very strong and nutty creating a very bready flavor, which was a nice change for a RIS. I liked this one colder rather than warm. Once this warms up it becomes a thin syrupy alcohol bomb. The bourbon was there but delicate and didnt overpower the hefty malt bill. Nice fruit components but its hard to distinguish the type of fruits. Glad I got to try this one.

Vintage 2011, No. 002
Pours black with some tann on mocha foam that falls to a broken sheet in a couple minutes. Nose is complex - honey, molasses, marshmallow, bourbon, vanilla and some black cherry. Flavor is sweet with toasted and roasted malts, molasses, dates, raisin, bourbon, oak, vanilla and hints of graham. Body is a little thin for the style initially with higher carb than Id prefer, and a semi slick finish that resonates longer than Id anticipated. This beer was better this time around than previous excursions. I like the nose here, and I rarely am dissappointed with a FW nose. 3.5/4.5/4/3.5/4

Initial review on 11JUN11
Vintage 2011, Batch 2
A: Pours a black as night beer with ruby and honey hues as light passes thru. Less than single finger of head over the coarse of the pour. Spotty lacing. Scattered light tan patches on surface.
S: Honey, vanilla, molasses, fig. The other day when I had this, it didnt smell nearly as nice. This one is lively with layers of malt, oak, wood, charred marshmallow, black cherries. 
T: Dark chocolate, bing cherry, medium toast oak, hints of alcohol, vanilla. This is much different now than several days ago, I was not impressed then - now: yes. Resonating finish with molasses, warmth, raisin and cherry. Nice oaky flavor carries through the entire palate and into the finish well. Some maduro feeling to this flavor profile, particularly on the finish.
M: Medium body for the style with moderately high carbonation on the style IMO. Semi dry finish mends the former two notes and it seems this beer could use a little viscosity to help weave the beer. 
O: This is certainly a sipping beer, and an excellent one at that. Im glad I hopped across the street for a beer to drink in this hotel before hitting the airport. As noted above this beer has excellent olfactory and palate play, but I think the mouthfeel takes away from the excellence of the beer. I also think this beer has such dominent wood character, that this would benefit from a year or two laying down to help it all come together. Granted, I think the malts would eventually turn this one really, really sweet, so it could be a delicate balance. Great beer for an oily, slow-burning, dark cigar. Or some pipe tobacco. Mostly would want the smoke in the air, not to actually take in as it would interfere rather than compliment the beer. 4/4.5/4/3/4 - 4.0

Well color me impressed. I find this to be superior to the prior years of the beer. It is bigger, a wee bit more subdued in the sweetness with more prominence in the roasted malt character, and an ever prominent bourbon facade. Absolutely delightful.

Serving type: on draft at the Rose & Crown a 2012 Vintage. Poured into a little mason jar type glassware. 

A: Bourbon, vanilla, dark, rich fruits, very malty sweetness. Intoxicating -- I think Im in love... 
A: A very deep, dark, rich garnet/ruby mahogany as opposed to the sheer pitch blackness you see in a lot of imperial stouts. SEXY pour, not just a beautiful pour. 
T: Blows me away. Absolutely, ridiculously delicious. The perfect concert of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, molasses, figs, dates, dark raisins, and malt all woven together by the woody undertones. WITHOUT A DOUBT, this is one of the best beers I have EVER had. Its very complex, I suspect it to get even more complex as I pull each bottle from the cellar. 
P: IMHO, very near a perfect imperial stout. Parabola is silky smooth, rich, creamy and dangerously drinkable. I dont taste the 12.5% anywhere in this beer. This beer deserves EVERY bit of hype it has received. It is phenomenally crafted and I am incredibly lucky to try it (and even more lucky to have a g/f that bought me 6 extra to cellar!). I would drink/buy this at every opportunity and recommend that anyone else who loves world class barrel aged stouts to do the same. Simply amazing. Maybe the best ever --- no THE BEST EVER!!!","New Jersey, USA","ClassyBeagle"

Finishes dark, smokey and hot.  A damn fine imperial stout.  Just wish it didnt cost so much.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

1025,"2013-06-01",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2013 No bottling date visible, but it was purchased at release, so its less than 3 months old.
Appearance: Pitch black body, thin tan head with average retention. The head settles into a foamy coating.
Aroma: The aroma is complex with sweet milk chocolate being on the forefront along side vanilla, coconut and bourbon.
Taste: Dark chocolate, roasted malts and light bourbon are on the intro that lead into the mid-taste. Coconut and bourbon come in during the end of the mid-taste with a touch of roasted malts, sweet chocolate and vanilla. Bourbon lingers on the finish with light oak.
Palate: Thick and velvety with light carbonation.
Overall: This is an excellently priced bourbon barrel aged imperial stout and this vertical has been fun seeing the differences between batches. I believe that the differences throughout are attributed to the batch variations rather than the changes of aging. This is a must buy if seen.


Bottled March 14, 2012 (1.3 years old).
Appearance: Pitch black body, thin tan head with average retention. The head settles into a frothy ring and a sparse coating.
Aroma: The aroma is strong of chocolate and coconut milk, upon swirling vanilla becomes prominent. Bourbon is very light on this, its hidden behind the more prominent aromas.
Taste: Sweet chocolate and vanilla greet the tongue immediately, with coconut milk quickly coming in with a bourbon backing. The finish has bourbon prominent that lingers with syrupy chocolate for a bit, the bourbon lingers long. Theres a touch of roasted malts towards the end of the mid-taste into the finish.
Palate: Creamy with light carbonation.
Overall: This is excellent. I enjoy the richness of this that I didnt find in the 2011. Coconut is very prominent and the bourbon is toned down. Very sippable.
Ratings: Ar: 8, Ap: 4, Ta: 8, Pa: 5, Ov: 16

Bottled April 20, 2011 (2.2 years old).
Appearance: Pitch black body with a thin tan head, average retention and settles into a bubbly ring and a sparse coating.
Aroma: Chocolate is prominent, though its slightly bittersweet instead of overly sweet. Bourbon is the next most prominent aroma, though its not overwhelming, its almost on par in strength with the chocolate though. Vanilla and oak act as supporting roles with hints of dark fruits and roasted malts. This smells nice.
Taste: Syrupy bittersweet chocolate is the strongest flavor here and its matched nicely by a bourbon presence. Roasted malts are introduced on the mid-taste and are really mild, a bit restrained until the finish which is sweet syrupy chocolate and roasted malts with a long finish of bourbon and oak. This is excellent.
Palate: Medium to thick bodied with sharp carbonation. Im surprised how lively this is for a beer of this style that is this old.
Overall: Parabola is one of my favorite bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts. This is balanced nicely despite the prominent bourbon flavors. This leans a touch sweet and is a great sipping beer. I would never pass this up, thats for sure.

Aroma: It has a nose of dark malts and bourbon, with some chocolate, coffee, roast, and wood

Appearance: This one has a black colored pour with a brown head that leaves heavy lace

Flavor: The taste is much the same as the nose, with heavy malty and bourbon flavors

First off, we were very excited when the bell rang and this got added to the draft list!  This beer is an absolute beast.  Its big and boozy, and it is also well made.

1025,"2013-03-22",4.1,"22oz bottle split. 2012 vintage.

A: Black as the heart of the devil with a sparse mocha foam for a head. Good legs, and this has a solid inky outlook. 

N: Lots of licorice, chocolate, tobacco, and dark chocolate candies. Fudge and theres noticeable oak. Vanilla and caramel act as a backdrop. Theres a touch of raisin and prune as well as coffee. 

T: Roasted coffee, fudge, dark chocolate, coffee, lots of smoke and tobacco over the top of the sweet base. However, it adds bitterness rather than ashtray. I enjoy how it has two distinguishable tiers. Theres a light licorice flavor, and the oak also adds a lot of chippiness to the proceedings. Leans towards astringency by the end.

M: Oily and slick. Very full texture. Alcohol is expertly hidden.

O: This vintage is doing very well, though theres definitely a lot of oak so be prepared for the grain. However, for being such a behemoth, it never loses its presence by hiding behind a cloying underattentuation. Props to this one. Ill have another.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Touches of vanilla, raisins, and a light alcohol hint. Flavor is similar. Rich, bittersweet dark chocolates up front with a good amount of roasts and caramel. The oak comes on with a lighter bourbon note as well as touches of vanilla, raisin, and licorice. Mocha, tobacco, and a bit more bourbon grows towards the end as this finishes rich, roasty, slightly ashy, and sweet with a nice bourbon warmth and dry oakiness. Lengthy aftertaste following a very smooth, mouth coating, full body and a soft, light carbonation. Overall, a very big, bold, rich, well balanced imperial stout with a solid barrel aged character.

A: Pours a jet black. There is no way light could even dream of entering this chamber of emptiness. A 2 finger dark brown head shines on the pour with a great liveliness. Frothy and bubbly, the head leaves some nice sticky lace and has some legs to boot.

S: I pick up the bourbon right away with a the great oak barrel as well. Light vanilla with a light alcohol complimenting it as well.

T: Incredible flavor combination. I get the bourbon right upfront which smooths out to a great woody barrel barrel and light hoppiness. The finish consists of some sweet vanilla, light chocolate and a warming alcohol with a touch of heat. Just really hits all the notes.

M: Very smooth and incredibly warming down the throat. Heavy bodied with little carbonation, but just enough make it alive down your through.

O: I thought this was a great barrel-aged RIS. The flavors all meshed wonderfully and I wonder how good this could be with a little bit of age on it.

All the best qualities of the 13 vintage (the depth, the richness, the bourbon character) was here in full force, but - despite being 14% - it wasnt that harsh. The oak was prevalent, but the fusel-y abrasiveness of the 13 was almost perfectly muted this time around. I was really shocked how well balanced this was (especially taking the last 2 vintages into account). Only thing I can really nitpick now is that it was rather sweet - hell, so is BCBS, and look at the score I still gave it!

Appearance is midnight black. If light passed through it, I didnt see it. Great 1-2 finger dark tan head that shows off its barrel-aging.

The aroma is strong of oak, bourbon, some vanilla and nice roasted coffee. It just smells rich and complex.

The taste follows the aroma nicely as it tastes as rich as it smells. Lots of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors mixed with the oaky vanilla complexity that makes this a great savoring beer. I feel like I need a cigar to pair with this beer. Some bitterness, but not overwhelming, I feel like some age could smooth it out some. Some bourbon, but blended well with the malt bill.

Aromas of bourbon and toasted oak, buttered oak, honey, rich chocolate, toffee, leather, and ash.  Really inviting.  The flavor is rich, bourbon-kissed oak and chocolate, toffee and buttered candies; light rum-soaked citrus (orange, grapefruit) notes build gradually, slightly bitter, mingling with cocoa and bourbon; the finish is both bitter and sweet, with bourbon and ash, and lingers for some time.  Beautiful palate; low carbonation, medium-bodied, rich and creamy, and lightly dry.  Very drinkable, and an absolute treat.  Much love to all the friends and family who supported this journey.

Taste is deep roasty malt, caramel/vanilla and some chocolate with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Also a bit of smoke in there too.

Reminds me of 12th anniversary Old Rasputin; its been too long though to tell which I prefer or to comment on their differences.  A lovely treat, and difficult to pinpoint any area of shortcoming (something Im good at doing.)

1025,"2012-06-30",4.4,"2012 Vintage poured into tulip 

Appearence: Pours a dark brown to almost black in color with about a one finger size head. The head is of a light brown color that dissapates quickly to leave some real nice lacing behind.

Smell: The smell is of a rather simple bourbon and vanilla with a slight alcohol. I do pick up on some possible chocolate and a sweetness like molasses with some faint roasted character. It is a pretty sweet smelling beer.

Taste: Upon initial taste I get the bourbon and vanilla followed by some of the sweetness and some faint chocolate. On the swallow I do notice a light hop character that really seems to tone down the sweetness and prevents this from being overly sweet. I must mention that the alcohol is fairly well hidden but at the same time noticeable. I do get some very, very slight alcohol burn but in no way unpleasant. A rather simple tasting beer but one that for that reason is easily enjoyed!

Mouthfeel: This beer is surprisingly smooth. I was expecting this to be ""hot"" and not as creamy as it is. The carbonation is pleasing and the body very enjoyable too. Its silky smooth in my mouth and not too viscous but like I said befor very creamy and smooth. Excellent feel!

Overall: Just a very enjoyable experience with this one. Not overy complicated but a rather straight forward beer that is a sipping pleasure. Im interested what some time would do to this but it is so good fresh I dont know if time would do this one good.","Illinois, USA","Sleuthdogg"

The nose is sweet with vanilla, maple, gingerbread, chocolate, oak. The bourbon isnt as strong in the nose as Id expected. 

Moderate mouthfeel, with decent carbonation presence. Slight oily feel on the back end, but drinks nicely. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla. Again, the bourbon is underplayed, but its subtlety is what I like about this. Rounds out a nice roasted brew, giving a welcome sweet balance.

1025,"2012-04-28",3.4,"2010 Bottle Release; Sampled April 2012
A vigorous pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a dense, darkly browned, fat-two-finger thick head. The beer is an inky black color that shows perhaps a hint of color around the edges when held up to the light, but remains ominously opaque. The aroma smells of hot alcohol, and Bourbon soaked fruit as I pour this, a closer inspection yields lots of barrel and bourbon influences and, at first blush, only a touch of toasted malt character. The barrel / bourbon character is fairly smooth, considering the 13% abv, with lots of burnt sweetened coconut, ample vanillin, touches of spicy oak, and lots of toasted character that supports the toasted malt. The malt character is here, especially as my nose gets used to the barrel influence that was so dominant at first; aromas of sweetened, concentrated black malts, touches of char, cold espresso, and lots of roasted nutty notes. Interestingly enough, the barrel character is dominant at first, but once your really start to dig in for an extended time, the malt aromatics come to dominate and almost completely consume the Bourbon notes; in the end this ends up well balanced between the barrel character and the dark malt character & is quite a bit more enjoyable than my first impression left me with. As the beer warms up it can be a touch hot smelling, which certainly detracts a bit, but isnt a deal killer for my enjoyment of the aroma.

Thick, rich, and viscous, this beer is most definitely a sipping beer; it isnt as dense, or cloying as something like Darklord, but certainly is a meal in a glass. The beer isnt as sweet as it could be, and much of the sweetness that is here is a complex, concentrated, roasted caramelization, rather than simplistic, cloying sweetness; this definitely escapes being cloying. Big, bitter, burnt, roast notes linger on the palate in the long finish; after some time the finish sees my first flavor influence from the barrel with some softer Bourbon-fruit notes (alcoholic melon more than anything), as well as some spicy oak notes and an astringency and alcohol warmth accentuating barrel character. Now that I have noticed the Bourbon character it is quite a bit more noticeable throughout the flavor profile. A rich nutty note, that is definitely on the roasted side of things, flavors the middle and finish of each sip. Vanillin flavors as well as notes of toasted coconut (in that order of noticeability) accentuate the sweetness in the middle of each sip. There is a sweet, somewhat concentrated, coffee syrup like note here that is a product of the ample residual malt and the roasted grains. The beer can be a touch hot and in my second pour the carbonation really seems to accentuated the spicy / hot Bourbon notes over the base, Imperial Stout; this is definitely much more enjoyable with a lighter carbonation. Once I swirl out a bunch of the carbonation a roasted cocoa and dark chocolate note start to come out. 

I like that this isnt overly Bourbon influenced, it is a bit hot & boozy in the end, but what can you expect from a 13% beer. Still, this does achieve a fair amount of balance in the end and is a nice way to cap off a long day; though I certainly wouldnt want to try and finish off a whole 22oz bottle.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

My glass is a thick looking mahogany color with a very thin brown head that reverts to a collar rather quickly.

My nose is filled with notes of roasted malts and coffee, some tobacco, smoke, dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. No one smell really dominates, making me think that I am in for a treat.

Parabola is a demonstration of brewing excellence. There is a confidence that a nuance will be noticed and no flavor must bludgeon you with its strength. Up front, roasted malt takes on a lightly charred character, and semi-sweet dark chocolate and a bit of molasses add further flavor and sweetness. Roast coffee and vanilla add some more delicate flavor, with a bit of oak and bourbon hardly noticeable at the end. 

The full body of this beer works well with the light to medium carbonation to create a decadent and creamy feel. The thickness is necessary to provide a reasonable base for such a rich and complex beer. 

This is a beer that definitely lives up to the hype. A bourbon barrel stout that still manages to be delicate and complex is a rare find. I will definitely try to stock up on this beer and look forward to having it again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

The smell on Parabola is world class.  I could of just sat there all night long just smelling this beer.  Its a sweet molasses smell mixed in with charred wood.  Espresso, vanilla, and chocolate round out the aroma.  Its a huge aroma.  An aroma that you can smell as soon as you pop the cap. 

When it came to the taste I picked up a hops that I didnt notice in the smell.  But other than that the taste mirrors the smell a lot with some of the ingredients making more of an appearance.  The chocolate and vanilla I mentioned come through more.  Burnt espresso also highlights the taste.  Rounded out with the lovely taste of bourbon, roasted malt, molasses, and caramel.  Just ridiculous.  For 13% the alcohol is hidden really well.

1025,"2011-12-17",4.1,"2011 vintage. 22 oz bottle from Beverages 4 Less in Santee CA, served in a snifter. Pours deep black with a small light brown head. The head fades quckly, leaving a thin remnant and a small amount of fine lace. On the nose, there are big notes of molasses, roasted malts, coffee, oak and bourbon, along with accents of tobacco, earth, chocolate and a touch of sherry. The flavour is both huge and complex. It begins moderately sweet up front but becomes increasingly bitter and increasingly peppery as it progresses. There are rich notes of molasses, oak and chocolate, along with tobacco and warming alcohol. The finish is long and malty with notes of bourbon, oak and hops. On the palate, it is full in body with a syrupy texture and average carbonation. Overall, this is an exceptional imperial stout. It has an enormous flavour and aroma that is also suitably complex with prominent notes of bourbon, oak, molasses and tobacco. At 12.5% abv, it is also a strong example and the alcohol is evident throughout.

1025,"2011-12-10",4.8,"I split a 22oz bomber with a friend. We each poured it into tulip glasses.

Appearance: Midnight black color, completely opaque with no carbonation visible. Forms a good-sized brown, frothy head which laces and retains very well for such a big beer.

Smell: Potent nose of whiskey, sour grape, black licorice and roasted malt. Sweet, oaky, vanilla qualities with a hint of smokiness. Extremely inviting.

Taste: Barrel-aged imperial stouts are all the rage these days, and for good reason: theyre delicious! Usually, these beers are aged in just one barrel for a year or more, but Firestone Walker Parabola is aged in multiple barrels, including spirits, wines, and previous beers. This creates for a very unique and equally complex palate. Of course, the base brew itself has a lot to do with it and you can tell they went out all on making an imperial stout of the highest quality.

Parabola hits the tongue with a massive amount of pure taste. Red grape, black licorice and toffee and caramel syrups are the most prominent flavors up front. Its sweet and rich, but in that authentic, all-natural way - nothing candy-like or artificial in the least. The second half transitions to more traditional stout qualities with deeply roasted malt and a strong bitterness to balance out the palate. On the finish comes a rush of wood, vanilla and more whiskey. The aftertaste, however, is remarkable clean. Not lingering bitterness, no cloying or sticky sweetness, either. Interestingly enough, theres little to no chocolate or coffee flavors in this palate, and instead more vinous and licorice qualities. Thats probably the only thing keeping me from considering it the best beer ever, but my friend Jay seemed to prefer it the other way around.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied for sure, with a thick, soft, comfortable texture. Noticeable warmth and whiskey sweetness across the tongue and a warming affect in the throat. But no sticky, cloying aftertaste.

Drinkability: This beer is pretty big at 12.5% ABV, but Ive had smaller beers that felt and drank much more potent than Firestone Walker Parabola. The palate is amazing in that its so robust and yet not intimidating at all. Its amazingly smooth, with a gentle presence of alcohol. A fantastic dessert beer, or something for a special occasion. Drinking an entire bottle alone would be challenging, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

T: Initially strong dark fruit/raisin flavors. As the beer warmed up a bit I got dark chocolate, roasted coffee and hints of vanilla. Amazing complexity and drinkability as the beer opened up.

Flavors bring out a lot of the nose, especially with the hints at coffee, vanillad oak, and chocolate malts.  The bourbon kicks in more towards the finish, and is pleasantly blended well with all the other flavors.

The flavor added strong hop bitterness, maybe some mocha notes, big bourbon with compatible warmth, and a dry & bitter finish that evoked some astringency.

A - Pours pitch black with a small cap of half finger tall tan head, dissipating down to almost nothing, leaving little to no lacing down the glass.

S - Plenty of dark malt, chocolate, vanilla, dulled bourbon heat, and some light charred wood. Good overall balance but nothing too over the top. Solid Stuff.

T - Flavors are similar to the nose. Lots of dark roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and charred oak. The booze is very well hidden, offering only short glimpses of the warming bourbon. Finish is a mix of sweetness and lightly warming heat. Damn, this is one good beer. I might need to get a few bottles of this for myself.

M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Nice full feel with some lingering sweet roast in the finish.

Pours thick black with a one finger brown head that leaves some spots of lacing and holds holds a small creamy cap all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Very inviting.

The incredibly potent aroma features strong bourbon notes, deep dark roasted malts, premium dark chocolate, coffee beans & espresso, vanilla & oak, a touch of smoke and some alcohol.  Like many top-tier bourbon barrel aged stouts, this is a great ""sniffer"" as I get just as much enjoyment from the aroma as I do the flavor.  Wonderful.

Flavor is like bourbon-soaked chocolate-covered raisins, bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, premium coffee/espresso, some caramel, rich roasted malts, dark fruits, some molasses and anise, minimal hops, moderate alcohol but not bad at all for a 13% brew...well hidden for its size.  Fairly sweet, one to sip and savor...a dessert in a glass!  Super-tasty.

Mouthfeel is THICK and sticky, just the way I like it.  Ill put it this way...Ten FIDY is too thin for my tastes and Parabola is one of the heavier Imperial Stouts Ive encountered.  Soft carbonation.  Id score it a 6 if I could!

My goodness what a brew!  Im a sucker for bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts and this is top shelf stuff right here...right up there with KBS and BCBS.

The beers both pour out a very dark brown, bordering on pitch-black color with a small to moderate tan head. The aroma was superior on the 2010, as the 2011 had a little more alcohol on it. Comparisons aside, the aroma was extremely complex. Lots of chocolate, some molasses, oak, dried fruits and a very light tell of the 13% ABV. The taste stands up to the complexity of the aroma, once again the 2010 bottle showing more complexities and subtleness. Taste was of rich chocolate cake, molasses, oak, vanilla,bourbon, dried plum, light cherry, roast and some light coffee notes, with only a very slight tell of the high ABV on the finish, o and with a silky smooth body.

A - Pours black, light tan-colored head, nice thick collar, bubbles around the sides of the glass, no lacing or retention.

S - Dark fruity sweetness, chocolate, oak, honey, with a nice smooth boozy alcohol heat. Very sweet, but the alcohol helps maintain some level of balance without being too hot.

T - Smooth boozy chocolate, dark fruits, honey, oak, some vanilla. Nice level of sweetness and booze. Very rich and dessert-like. A nice dose of booze, but theres no way I would be able to guess its 13%.

M - Full, rich and smooth, nice light carbonation, creamy finish.

O - An excellent BA stout. Its truthfully hard to find something wrong with this beer, besides the looks. Some of those who had this fresh said its really settled down over the year (or so) its been aging. Recommend, the 2010 vintage is drinking wonderfully now.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

Slight touch of booziness in the finish along with more of the cocoa and vanilla. Super full sticky and slightly syrupy body and a soft carbonation.

The flavor is molasses, vanilla, chocolate, and figs. Finishes with whiskey and oak.  Does not have a bourbon character that I recognize, which is nice, but it does have a whiskey component which I dislike as much, if not moreso.

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a one finger dark mocha head that quickly fades into a thick lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.

Complex aroma with a good balance of luscious roasted malt, dark fruit, coffee and bourbon. The barrel character is there without overpowering the other notes. Lots of earthy oak/dry wood in the nose along with sweet boozy bourbon as well as some hints of vanilla and toasted coconut. Lots of dark roasted malt giving off hints of dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean, oatmeal and tobacco. Slightly smokey but not burnt or acrid smelling. Smells like there might even be some cedar in there. Surprisingly, underneath all of this, there is some very faint light fruit and licorice as well as a good bit of earthy, piny hops. This beer has 80 IBUs and it shows in the nose, even with all of the other intense aromas.

Chewy full body with a blast of dry, bitter hops up front that lingers thrughout the intense malt backbone into a nice warm fnish. Resinous, earthy pine flavor that holds its own against the more intense, robust flavors. This adds another dimension to this beer that I wasnt expecting. After the initial bitterness there is a strong barrel presence with a prominent dry oak/wood flavor. The bourbon and other spirits are there but they are well integrated into the beer withut turnng it into a hot, boozy mess. The smoother vanilla/marshmallow/coconut notes that were suggested in the aroma arent evident to my palate.

Although there is a nice bourbon flavor, the robust, roasted malt flavors are very prominent. Lots of luscious dark chocolate, oatmeal and burnt toast as well as a very strong roasted coffee bean presence. The coffee/espresso flavor is deep and roasty but is not stale, burnt or acrid tastng at all and doesnt overpower the other flavors. Again, Im picking up a good amount of smokiness/tobacco flavor that Im really loving. All of these flavors are bouncing off of one another resulting in an incredibly complex, delicious beer. Each sip brings something new and although there is some nice heat and burn in the finish, the ABV at 13% is very well masked. Very quaffable and tackling the whole bomber was no problem for me. Maybe that says more about me than the beer but thats a discussion for another time.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1025,"2011-01-26",4.5,"Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to piclee for this.

4.0 A: I had to make an aggressive pour to coax one finger of creamy light brown head. Average retention and not really any lacing.

4.5 S: Aroma is just what I like from a -bal brew. The stout shines while the bourbon takes a complementary role. A decent amount of semisweet chocolate in this one. Indeed, the sweet character outweighs the roasty but not by a whole lot. Roasted barley makes an appearance next with a touch, and only a touch, of coffee. Finally, the bourbon comes in completing the very nice nose. As it warms, the bourbon comes through stronger.

4.5 T: Taste is just as good as the nose. Sweet chocolate stands out first, with roastiness next, and bourbon on the finish. There a bit of fruitiness in the taste that wasnt in the nose: plum and raisin. Alcohol is apparent, but at an acceptable rate given 13%. Its really hard to figure out how complex this is. The chocolate, roasted barley, and bourbon dominate, but it seems like there is more beneath. Bourbon, booziness, and a roasty bitterness lingers on aftertaste.

5.0 M: Thick, syruppy body. Good moderate carbonation. This is how I like my imperial stouts. Rich and creamy or bust. Relatively smooth with a warming finish.

5.0 D: Excellent brew. Great aroma, great taste, awesome mouthfeel, but the alcohol is a bit of an ass kicker and moreso than comparable brews (BCBCS, for example). Still, solid brew overall. Im glad I have another one. I think some age will do wonders with this one.

Edit: This gets much better as it warms up. Drinkability score adjusted.

I am Ok with bourbon in moderation, we are not a corn distilled fan nation, but it was too much.  Cocoa was also extraneous.  This is above average body, it was finishable, I owed it to the brewers.

Aroma holds huge amounts of toffee, caramel, and peanut brittle-- very sweet. Also some definite notes of char and vanilla. The bourbon barrel is certainly not as aggressive as many of this style, and the alcohol is very hidden. Flavor is also very sweet, but shifts to more a chocolate presence. Near the finish a wonderful charred bitterness takes over, and in the aftertaste a bit of heat from the bourbon comes through.

Crazy complexity in the aroma! Initially the bourbon is obvious but not the solo player. There is tons of burnt malt, chocolate, prunes, fig jam, vanilla, and cigar box. Palate is the same: yes there is bourbon and barrel here, but the beer more than holds up against it. Hard roast, chocolate, oaky vanilla, porty fruits (cherries, raisins), cigar box, aniseed.

A: Pours near-black with a nice tan head that sticks around with a bit of lacing.

S: Very, very nice. The first thing I notice is quite a bit of oak alongside some vanilla and bits of char. In the background there are notes of chocolate and roasted coffee.

T: Much the same as the nose, but the roasted malt and oak take over a little bit, not allowing many of the subtle complexities to come through. It is very clear that this played a big role in the final FW13 blend.

M: Nice and creamy. Medium to full body.

D: Quite drinkable, although I really wish that the flavor profile was as well-integrated and complex as the nose. Im definitely looking forward to trying this with a bit of age on it.

Nicely light on the bourbon, allowing some interesting vinous, tobacco, oak, rich chocolate, roast, and even some light hops to shine as well.  Much like I find their anniversary series, the nose is great, but the flavor is a little too bourbon heavy.  It gets a little better the more you have, but it still takes me back a step.  The chocolate, vinous, and oak notes are really nice though and overall outweigh the negative bourbon character.  The alcohol is very well hidden for such a high ABV as well.

1025,"2010-10-14",4.2,"Bomber, courtesy cquiroga.  Pouring a dense, oily looking, glossy black color, the hefty body supports a small crown of ultra-smooth, creamy, light brown foam.  Tapering off to a thin-walled ring with just a skin at the center, the head has a wet spotting and dense brown staining effect on the glass.  Beautiful brew.  The nose approaches mastery, layered with deep, rich, chocolate cake malts, fudge, biscuit, sweet tobacco, and vanilla.  Charred oak lends just a touch of smoke character, as distinctly British style hops serve as the perfect counterpoint.  Bourbon is persistently smooth throughout, serving an appropriate backup role, and creamy oats act as the glue that binds everything together.  Flavors run along much the same lines.  Fluffy chocolate cake with fudge icing comes to mind.  Vanilla and creamed oats bring a softness that counters the dark roast and the barrel char beautifully.  Bourbon is perhaps a little too assertive, but its a fact that is easily overlooked considering the near perfect malt billing.  Big bodied, oily, and viscous, the palate just glides effortlessly as it rolls back and forth across the tongue.  Well after the swallow, the mouth is coated in smooth, bourbon-kissed chocolate goodness.  Warmth is certainly there, but it isnt overly hot or anything.  Overall, this is a wonderful slow sipper.  It is straightforward, not overly complex, but it is masterful in its simplicity.  Id probably say that this surpasses most of the anniversary blends that Ive had to date, for my tastes.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1025,"2010-06-20",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This rich dessert of an Imperial Stout extends blackberry esters, bourbon, dark chocolate and raisins onto one of the smoothest and wealthiest bodies found in the style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam crowns the brown-edged blackness. 
-Apart from the woods contribution, the nose doesnt have that much to offer.
-The contemplative finish incorporates wooden barrel notes to an alcohol splash, perfect to cut through the amazingly oily mouthfeel. 
-This may not be one of the most complex Imperial Stouts out there, but it achieves its goal magnificently.

1025,"2010-06-20",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2012 Bomber. Aroma is an intoxicating blend of mocha, vanilla, roasted malt and bourbon. Appearance is charcoal black with a thin milky layer of light brown head. Excellent lacing throughout the glass. Taste starts off with big and bold roasted malt and dark chocolate flavors followed by creamy caramel, vanilla, espresso and black cherries. An oaky bourbon flavor is also present in each sip. Mouthfeel is silky, creamy and slightly syrupy with low carbonation. It finishes sweet and roasty with a pleasantly warm alcohol finish. The barrel aging process definitely enhances the rich chocolate and caramel malt flavors. The oak and bourbon flavors also add additional layers of complexity. It would pair quite well with a rich and creamy chocolate dessert.

There also is some leather present and a little bit of salty soy sauce, too.  Really quaffable.  Opaque black body with a medium light brown head that is strong and leaves some stellar lacing.    Starts a little acidic and hot on the tongue, before some chocolate maltiness and roastiness comes through.  Strong bourbon in the middle with some oak, too.  The finish has a bit of an astringency present, and a fairly nice bitterness.  The finish is rather warming...this definitely has some alcohol in it, but the ethanol isnt overly noticeable.  The astringency is a bit weird, but otherwise this is enjoyable.  I dont know if aging this will really improve it much, though.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

------- to Greg for sharing this beer. Its a nice looking black pour with a tan head. The flavor is of bittersweet chocolate with some dark cherries.

Huge beer, symmetrical and classic. I guess since the style is so big, somehow a bodybuilding metaphor comes to me: Imperial Stout is the  Mr. Olympia contest of beer, and this is the Frank Zane of the style - perfectly proportional and yet compact in stature.

A- Body is big, thick, opaque and black. Pours with a soapy light brown head, which fades quickly, to a thin collar and leaves behind little lacing in the glass.

S- Nose is all about the bourbon barrel. Very woody, quite boozy, with a mild cocoa and bourbon sweetness.

T- Upfront is a big dose of roasted chocolate malt-which isnt present in the nose really at all and a pleasant surprise in the flavor. There is also a lot of oak and some bourbon. The alcohol becomes prominent for the finish in both flavor and heat.

P- Body is fairly heavy with a moderate weight and a lot of astringent alcohol consistency.

O- This brew, much like the full sail BBL stout, showcases the aspects of the barrel rather than the stout itself. Nothing wrong with that-but I prefer more balance. Its a decent, above average brew overall.

Pours as deep black/brown as any beer Ive seen. A dark tan head grows when poured and slowly reatreats into itself. The nose is dark chocolate, bourbon whiskey, vanilla, charred oak, hops, and alcohol. The taste is initially roasted coffee, vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate and transitions into a light hop presence, and more chocolate, and smoke. The palate is thick and chewy (not as much as Goose Island Bourbon County Stout) . The lacing is moderate and decently carbonated. The alcohol (13%) is well hidden. One of the best RISs Ive had. As good as Goose Island, Great Divide Oak Aged, and The Abyss.","Washington, USA","waltersrj"
1025,"2010-05-23",3.0,"Bottle thanks to visionaries (BA)!Near black with a thin tan ring for a head, lightly oily. Nose is washed out, mainly wood and ethanol with very little of the bourbon. Also light plum and anise. Flavor isnt as bad, the large, creamy body probably helping this, but its still dominated by wood and ethanol, some bourbon showing in a bit of light vanilla. There is also some chocolate and bitterness from roasted malt emerging in the finish. This continues to grow with warmth, chocolate taking control near the end of the glass.

1025,"2010-05-22",4.2,"City Beer Store, Parabola release party. Two incredible barrel-aged beers from Firestone Walker in one night. Parabola pours a wall-to-wall black with a great brown head, thick and creamy. The aroma is complex and wonderful. Bourbon and oak are probably the strongest notes, but they dont dominate quite as much as in Parabola. Theres a ton of dark chocolate, a healthy dose of roasted malt and a touch of vanilla. Brown sugar, molasses and caramel round it out. The flavor is all barrel-aged imperial stout goodness. All of those roasty sugars did their magic in the barrel, changing and blending with the barrel notes. Its not exactly sweet, but there are plenty of sugars present. Theres definitely no unpleasant cloying sensation, despite its viscous feel. The finish gives a mild hop bite. This is a wonderful imperial stout.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

1025,"2010-05-17",4.4,"Appearance:  Pours a midnight brown with a thin tan cap of froth. This beer is very viscous and leaves behind decent legs.

Aroma:  Dark chocolate, raisin, bourbon, huge oak, burnt roast,black cherry.

Taste:  A mixture of dark chocolate and bourbon right away, and as I taste in most bourbon barrel imperials, graham cracker and vanilla. As I dive in deeper, I get very pronounced wood notes, sharp burnt roast finishing with black coffee and spicy hop bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Like thick silky pudding or mousse. The booze gives it a very warm coating mouthfeel.

Overall: Another amazing big beer from Firestone Walker.  The hype on this was modest, and believe it or not, the price tag is spot on. This is nothing you would want to rush into.  I thought with it being a blend of former batches of Parabola, this would be less spicy and warm than it was.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

1025,"2009-08-10",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2010 A big-ass RIS -- that I hyped considerably -- poured into a snifter at Blue Palms.  Aroma was quite woody, with peat, dark chocolate and noticeable booze.  Flavor had strong bourbon components, to go along with musty wood, licorice, soft roasts and firm booziness.  Finish is very warming, with vanilla-sweetness.  Palate is syrupy-thick throughout, verging on oily.  And it lasts a long, long time in your mouth.  There is much complexity here, but I think Firestone may have overdone this one.  The sweet-booziness is quite high, overriding other (perhaps more interesting) flavors. Or am I just over the mystique of the barrel-aged? 3.8.
update, 2010 bottling:  sampled 6/25/10: aged only a couple months.  Pours pitch black, viscous, dark brown wispy head.  Aroma is vanilla, oak, hint of chocolate and cigar, espresso.  Mouthfeel is extremely creamy and full, slides across your tongue like liquid marshmellow.  Flavor begins with almond-vanilla (barrel), bourbon, brown sugar.  This is soon layered with creamy chocolate and more malt.  The 80 IBUs is positively buried underneath all that malt!  Finish is long, warming.

1025,"2008-08-30",3.9,"GABF 2007.  Oily in the glass without much head at all, just tracings of foam on top.  Oily roasty smell with hop oils and a little bit of malt sweetness apparent.  Nicely sweet in the mouth with the roast emerging late and only on the sides of the mouth, the sweetness is like confectioner’s sugar, slightly vanilla.  The finish starts with the roastiness in the malts, then the hops emerge and make it chewy, ultimately settling into an acrid bitter burn that was a bit off.  The hops are more apparent in this than other impy stouts I’ve had, which makes it nicely unique.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is opaque black (flashlight tested).

Aroma is moderately to heavily malty (chocolate, caramel, nuts, roasted grain), with notes of alcohol, vanilla, whiskey, wood, sherry.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Full body, creamy/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, heavily alcoholic.

Pleasant but somewhat ordinary aroma thats bursting with alcohol.  Combination of bitterness and alcohol keep the massive sweetness from being too oppressive. Too boozy for its own good, but if you can get past that its reasonably elegant underneath.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Appearance is a dense and dark brown hue, thick brown pillowy head, thick lacing on the glass.

Smell is a delicious and complex range of aromas: bourbon whiskey, oak, vanilla, cherries, chocolate and coffee malts, sweet milk, brown sugar/molasses.

Taste is initially smooth milk chocolate malts that transition quickly to boozy whiskey and wood, tones of vanilla and dark fruits, opens up to grainy oatmeal malts, finishes sweet and dry.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy smooth texture is very pleasing and well-crafted, moderate carbonation.

Drinkability is high, delicious and well-balanced barrel-aged stout, great malt profile and creamy texture, good oak presence that accents without dominating, sweetness fluctuates between milk chocolate and dark fruits, absolutely a wonderful beer and a must-try for any beer fan!","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"
