2783,"2016-02-20",3.5,"Bottle thanks to Nikos! I sorta dropped this one on its cap, so there was an impressive amount of gushing, but not the beers fault. Pours hazy amber, long lasting medium beige head, dissipates slowly with nice lacing. Aroma is for all intents and purposes a wild beer - funky, oaky, light smoke and lemon. Flavor is quite different, not funky or tart, light sweet, light bitter, oak, light smoke, toffee, perhaps a bit of acidity. Medium body. Certainly not what I would expect of a Polotmavy, but I enjoyed this one.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

2783,"2014-08-26",3.1,"Jun 14. A 1 l plastic bottle kindly shared by the Slovakian RB crew, thanks! It poured hazy amber, lightly copper body with a quite small head. Aroma of toasted malt like caramel and toast, a bit of burnt sugar. Herbal hops were here as well. Bitter flavor, hops tend to balance it out much more now with malt notes being less sweet than in nose, but still toasted. Not bad. Medium bodied, moderate finish, follows the flavor being rather short and notably on the bitter side. Although simple it was quite fine and pleasant polotmavy.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

2783,"2014-05-08",3.5,"1 liter plastic bottle from trade with Cuso, thanks! Poured into a tulip glass, ABV 4.8%
Light amber colour on the body, very clear and transparent, with a small and thin off-white head on top, with low retention, leaving minimal lacing on the glass.
Aroma has lots of caramel, toffee, sweet Id say, with nice floral notes popping every now and then. 
Nice taste, caramel and fresh floral hops, toffee. Moderate bitterness on the finish, lasts long enough on the aftertaste.
 Medium thin body, carbonation is okay, maybe a bit low at first but at the end works just fine.
Overall, a good beer, pleasant to drink and easy too.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"
2783,"2014-02-09",3.1,"From 1,0l PET bottle, BBD: 25.02.2014. Appearance: Pours nice clear amber-orange liquid with NO head! (I suppose should be some bad bottle) Aroma: Malt, caramel, sweet/ fruit, light orange somewhere behind. Aroma is not very intense. Taste: Medium sweet, medium bitter. Palate: medium body, thin texture, soft carbonation (thinking it should be connected with the missing head), bitter finish. Overall: Nice drinkable amber lager, no head and rather soft carbonation deceived me, but I believe it was only a bad poured bottle, so It did not affected my rating even though I expected more from this lager.","Bratislava, SLOVAK REPUBLIC","HerrBierkoenig"
2783,"2014-01-02",3.4,"0.1l plastic bottles from trade with Misow. Thanks man! This big bottle brings back some good and some bad memories from my youth. It looks quit nice in the glass with a big frothy off-white head and a light blurry kinda orange amber looking body thats filled with lots of floaters and small sediments in the glass. The nose is light caramel and almost a little ripe fruity. Behind the sweetness there is a soft sourness lurking. Hope its still OK this. Hints of metal and malts. Not bad at all. In the taste Im quickly calmed and can safely report that its quite alright despite my suspicions. It has a average light oily mouthfeel and its just above average on the carbonation level. Soft watery caramel in the taste. Its a bit pilsner-ish in that near metallic way. Not overwhelming or to memorable but its a good thirst quencher - and there is lots of beer to quench that nasty thirst. Ends with traces of some berries and a soft round pilsner bitterness. Thanks for the bottle Mikal, Ill be sipping on this all night! 02.10.2013","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

A bitter and hoppy finish, Stands out from the crowd. I think the  leziak and  Jantar are actually the same beer.
