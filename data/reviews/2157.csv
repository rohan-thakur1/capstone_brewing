2157,"2017-06-04",3.3,"Sampled from the tap at Red Cow North Loop. Pours a clear gold with a slight orange hue and a white head that dissipates to the edges and laces. Aroma has a good amount of straw supported by a bit of rye and juniper. Flavor is similar with rye, bread and straw backed by a touch of juniper and honey.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2157,"2016-07-27",3.6,"Tap at brewery. Light amber with a lasting white head. Juniper, herbal tea, biscuit, and light rye aroma. Has a herbal, slight earthy, dry flavor. Lighter body with a watery feel. Very refreshing, flavorful, clean tasting beer.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"
2157,"2016-07-08",3.3,"On tap at busters pours a clear reddish copper with a small white head. Muted mild aroma of sweet honey malt, rye, and dry hop spice. Taste of sweet honey malts, light rye, faint but present juniper, some hop bitterness on the finish. More like a pale ale with a bit of juniper than the few Sahtis Ive had. Ok.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"

2157,"2013-03-15",3.7,"On tap at Stouts Pub. Slightly hazy deep amber pour. Nose had some subtle juniper / pine in it. Really nice - not overpowering, good sweetness balanced with hops and a nice earthiness to it.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
2157,"2012-07-01",3.4,"Winterfest 2012. The aroma is dry and herbal.  Flavor is dry also, with bitterness. Red in color, and I can pick up the juniper. Fairly simple, but good.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
2157,"2012-02-25",3.8,"Pour on tap at Winterfest 2012, pour was slightly hazy yellow-orange with white head, aroma brought notes of caramel and biscuity malts but right away you got the herbal and spice notes, honey sweetness also stuck its head in there as well.  Taste is a nice mix of juniper and spruce notes, hints of honey and other slight spices with rye, sweet biscuit malt finishes fairly dry and slightly sweet, but this is definitely an interesting and fairly well done brew.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
2157,"2012-02-05",3.7,"My favorite of the 3 sampled at Winterfest 2012. Poured light orange yellow with a soapy quick white head. Aroma was very nice fruity with subtle spice from the rye. Taste was again nice and fruity with a solid biscuit breadiness and finished with a little spice. Palate was thin clean crisp with a dry finish. This is an awesome easy drinking brew with full fruity flavor that finishes bready.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
