1415,"2017-01-07",3.8,"Bottle pour into shaker pint glass from Greg & Janes Beer and Wine. Appearance is lightly hazy, light brown-reddish copper with tons of sparkle, 2+-finger width foamy beige head with excellent retention and thick sudsy lacing. Aroma is strong bready and caramel malts, light sweet astringent alcohol/acetone. Taste is bready malt with caramel, light sweet alcohol. Palate is medium bodied with creamy texture, soft carbonation, light warmth in esophagus, sweet malty finish. Overall, not the most complex style but above average in all categories. Nice Alt!","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
1415,"2016-10-27",4.3,"Pours a slightly hazy mahogany with small tan cap. Pretty. Aroma is that of a dopplebock (a fave) - raisins, molasses, ripe dark fruits - love it. Flavor follows very similarly with lots of malty sweetness embedded with ripe fruits. Just enough barely detectable mild earthy hop kicks in at the end of the sip to almost balance it and leave a fairly clean finish with only the slightest sweet lingering. This stuff is fantastic.","New Hampshire, USA","tekstr1der"
1415,"2016-03-30",3.6,"From notes (May 2015). A bigger, scaled up version of Tuckermans flagship, this is noticeably maltier and fuller. Good, grainy taste and some nice yeast notes, before finishing really clean.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

1415,"2015-01-03",3.8,"Pours a dark copper from a bottle with thick off-white head. Aroma is faint banana and brown sugar, covered up by the head. Flavor is a sweet, malty cherry, with a hit of bitterness. Slight burn from the alcohol, palate is slightly thin. A good beer.","East Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA","Quick3Beers"
1415,"2013-12-31",3.1,"On tap at Battleship. Pours a murky dark amber color with a super thick white head. Aroma is of dusty malts, hops and aluminum. Taste is pretty much the same with a little roasty toasty sweetness. Quite possibly molasses. Nice lacing. Leaves a toasted malt finish.","Fall River, Massachusetts, USA","halfonit"
1415,"2013-11-12",3.6,"Sinus clearing spicy caramel-dough aroma. Dark brown, very active, lasting head film. Brown sugar malt, nut and dark fruit taste, and fairly bitter at that. Thick and heavy all around. Best beer of this style I can remember being made Germany.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","Scrapersnbeer"
1415,"2013-11-11",3.6,"Malty aroma, with nuts, caramel/toffee, and some spice. Flavor is somewhat sweet and a little spicy. Some pine hops and a fair amount of drying alcohol in the finish. A nice, tasty sipper.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
1415,"2013-09-29",3.8,"Bottle, shared with my wife. Deep amber brown, average tan head. Fruity caramel aroma, with deeper dark sugar notes and a pleasant yeasty edge. Rich malty palate, dark sugars, dates, fruity yeast. Rich and full bodied, excellent.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

1415,"2013-02-02",3.4,"12oz bottletan-mahogany.  A-roasty/anise/earthy-med malt, hint of med fruit.  T-roasty med malt overtaken by antiseptic.

Bought 5 days before drinking.  7/4/5/3/11=3.0  Better cold.  7/4/6/4/13=3.4","Florida and, New Jersey, USA","jcwattsrugger"
1415,"2012-08-13",4.5,"Their interpretation of a Sticke Alt.   Pours a dark brown with a smooth tan head.  This surprised me as taste was malty and clean on the palate.  Looking forward to this fall seasonal.","Rhode Island, USA","fernans"
1415,"2012-07-10",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2014 Bottle from Berts Better Beers in Hooksett, NH. Dark dirty brown-amber pour with a smaller cream head. Aroma is toffee and earth. Fuller palate. Taste is very malty, toffee, and some hop kick. Very good.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
1415,"2012-04-20",4.0,"Pours a two finger khaki head that fades slowly to thin layer leaving some lace. Dark brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Malty caramel nose, flavor is similar, chewy caramel with hops balancing. Decent Alt. $2.95 for a 12oz bottle from Berts Better Beers Hooksett, NH.","Bow, New Hampshire, USA","jimhilt"
1415,"2012-02-09",3.7,"Pours a deep brown, slightly cloudy with garnet highlights when held to light. Bubbly frothy tan head shows some staying power and lots of sticky lace. Heavy toffee and caramel on the nose with hints of butterscotch, light fruit, and ethanol. Faint hint of earthy hops, but this one smells like its a gonna be sweet. My nose certainly didnt steer me wrong this is a sweet beer. Lots of toffee, butterscotch, caramel and brown sugar, bits of fruit and earthy hops. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy sugary mouthfeel. This grew on me, but it really needs something else. Maybe some more hops, or something else to cut through the almost over bearing toffee sweetness.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
1415,"2012-01-28",3.7,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an Oct 12 expiration date. It pours a handsome looking heady, dark amber with slow moving carbonation.  The head stays around. The aroma is malty and sweet with a mellow but notable hop feel.  Medium to full body. The taste is malty sweet with a bite of yeast and a balanced dry hopped finale. A seriously good beer.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
