2908,"2016-04-19",4.1,"Weak off putting aroma, good apple smell, but with an astringent quality, fortunately not very strong. Clear golden color slightly opaque, but not cloudy. Great dry apple flavor, primarily a red apple subtlety with the tartness of a good green apple especially in the aftertaste. Very carbonated, which goes well with the light flavor and body.","California, USA","Spike531"

2908,"2013-10-29",4.1,"750mL c&c 2012 ed. Clear bottle. $25 from P St Whole Foods DC. Cork rockets out of the bottle, CAUTION!! Pours with excessive carbonation, tepid pour yields an IPA like head that really never fully dissipates. Easily the best appearance for any cider Ive ever seen. Glowing, full haze peach color. Leaves some lacing. Seriously? Nose is really getting there for premier Norman ciders like Ferme du Lavoir, Cave de Mirande, and Benoit et Sylvie Noël. Aroma is pure starfruit and peach juice, similar to peach sour beers. Theres a musty cellar, barnyard note is unmistakeable as Norman farmhouse yeast with touches of orchard Brett. Taste is juicy starfruit, mildly bitter apple skin tannin balance, very dry in the finish. Encompassing, fresh apple skin and flesh engulf the sides and roof of the mouth. Very impressive cider. If very fresh, I have no doubt this cider is in the top leagues of French cider and thus world cider.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2908,"2013-10-29",4.6,"Thanks to GT2! Beer pours with heavy carbonation, head similar to an IPA. Theres little head retention, but thats to be expected with a cider. Hazy golden-orange color. Aroma is almost like a peach lambic, juicy peaches and fresh flowers, also a little dusty. The taste, wow. Its pretty dry, which I really enjoy. Taste is peaches, some light citrus, a fresh sweetness but nothing cloying. Again, that dryness really balances it out really well. Absolutely well done.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
2908,"2013-07-15",4.2,"2012 version, 3,5%. Bottle, bought @ the cidery. Pours clear golden with a medium, fizzy white head. Aroma has fresh apple, citrus, moldy oranges, light sugary. Highish carbonation, fine dry and quite creamy mouthfeel. Flavour has good green apples, complex oaky character, light sherry, mild apple vinegar, kinda like a bit of leafy freshness. Really stunningly balanced, especially considering the low ABV.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
