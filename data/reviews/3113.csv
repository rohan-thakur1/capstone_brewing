This arrives from the tap with a solid one finger thick, nicely browned, dark tan colored head that is quite nice for a tap beer.  The beer is a dark color, approaching black that shows some clear ruby highlights around the edges of my glass.  The aroma has a nice smokiness to it that is just what I was looking for.  There is a touch of roast character here as well that adds a nice edge to the nose and a bit of coffee aromatics come out after a bit of time.

My first sip sees me noticing the roast flavors up front; notes of roasted grain and coffee like notes add some acidity, but then a solid smoky back-note comes into play here.  This has a rich, malt-driven mouthfeel that provides a velvety texture that coats and envelopes the palate.  The only downside it that a roasted edge  adds a bit of sharp, burnt, acrid, acid character towards the finish that tends to cut into the lushness towards the finish.  The roast character is still soft enough though that it does not overwhelm things overall.  In fact, as the beer warms it starts to lose that acrid sharpness quite a bit.  A really nice, significant chocolate like flavor starts to come out at this time that just adds to the richness of this beer and pairs really quite nicely with the nice smokiness.  

While I like a lot of smoke in a beer, I like that this beer only has enough to contribute significantly, but still play a equal / supporting role to the rest of this beers character.  This was done quite nicely, and I am especially enjoying this beer after it has warmed up and softened up a bit.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3113,"2009-03-01",3.9,"Mini growler from Half-Time.  Pours a deep black with a smallish brown head which deflates quickly.  Smoke, port, stone fruit, toasted malt and.  Medium to thick mouthfeel, enhanced by the light creamy carbonation.  Slightly sweet, but with a good amount of roast.  Lots of slowly developing smoke on the finish.  Really good, and a couple steps above what I usually think of for SN.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3113,"2009-02-28",3.8,"16 oz. pint - $4.75 at Taco Mac in Canton, Georgia.

Appearance: Black body, not quite opaque, with a lean, beige-colored head.

Smell: Aroma of roasted maltiness mingled with notes of chocolate and industrial-grade smoke.

Taste: Roasty, blackened malts with a charry smoke component and taste of unsweetened chocolate stirred up with licorice root. Nominal sweetness throughout. Small hint of fruit. Negligible but noticeable alcohol presence. Medium-low bitterness builds as you near the drying, smoky, roasty finish.

Mouthfeel: SNISP is a bit above medium, both in terms of body and carbonation.

Drinkability: Its likable. Mostly, its just nice to see Sierra Nevada releasing a new beer that isnt just another pale ale of IPA.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
3113,"2009-02-27",3.4,"Tap at Barcade: Dark brown with dark khaki head. Lightly smoky nose with more chocolate character than anything. Theres a touch of sweet peat in there, and perhaps a milky note. Slick creamy body. The flavor has a dense malt character with only mild smoke, more lean peated character with some cocoa as well. Not too sweet, with a light roasted note. Decent, just a simple solid Porter, and not smoky enough!!","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
3113,"2009-02-27",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2009 This is what I look for in a smoked porter. Dark black pour with a fingers worth of caramel colored head. Strong chocolate presence in the aroma with the unmistakable aroma of ash. Surprisingly this one is sweeter than I expected. Sweet chocolate and molasses flavors meld well with a bold smoke presence. Must get more of this before the keg runs out.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
3113,"2009-02-25",4.4,"Draft at Taco Mac. Pours a deep, dark, almost-black ruby with almost no head (typical Taco Mac pour). The foam is tan in color and leaves spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is sweet and vinous with maltiness with notes of chocolate, too. The taste has lots of chocolate, coffee, fruit, sweet malts, subtle smoke, and some alcohol. At mid-palate the beer is quite rich and wonderfully bittersweet. The finish is full and chocolatey.  The palate is smooth and creamy. It is full in body and has a light tingle of carbonation up front that slightly accents the smokiness. Overall, a wonderful winter beer - warming, full, rich, and dangerously drinkable.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"
3113,"2009-02-22",3.7,"A mishap pour on tap at binnys south loop (chicago, il). Pours a nice dark pour, brown around the edges, largely opaque, with nice tannish head that dissipates down. Aromas are a touch smokey oak and peat, nice roasted malts, and a subtle sweetness. Initial is fairly full bodied, nice smokey oak character that doesnt get in the way of the nice roasted malt, but takes some nice edge off of its sharpness. Nice maltiness, light smoke, full on the palate with nice aftertaste. Light sweetness mixed well wit the burnt and smokey malts. Nice, a touch one dimensional.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3113,"2009-02-20",3.9,"Poured a nearly opaque black color with a small, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of roasted malts, smoked meat, burnt wood, and some caramel.

Very pleasant aroma of smoke, chocolate, and roasted malt.  The flavor is roasted malt, wood smoke and a touch of chocolate.  Rich, fairly creamy mouthfeel.  Moderate bitterness at the finish.  A very enjoyable smoked beer.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
3113,"2009-02-15",3.4,"Draught at TND:  Aroma of light smoke, light bamburg wood, light dark malts, and slight roasting.  Poured very dark brown in color with a medium-sized, dense, light brown head, that lasted throughout.  Clear.  Not sparkling.  Flavor is lightly sweet.  Tastes of chocolate, slight bamburg wood, roasted malts, and light vanilla.  Medium to full body.  Viscous, lightly dry textue.  Average carbonation.  Slightly sweet, malty finish.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
3113,"2009-02-13",4.0,"Growler at Big Z. Poured opaque black with a thin beige head. Nose was intensely smoked with chocolate, and roasted malts. Flavor was similar, mouthful on the mediun side. Kind of a crossover between a porter and a stout, but that is just mincing words. The fact seems to be that Sierra wants to stay current and is releasing new beers worthy of notice.","jericho, New York, USA","TeamTrappist"

3113,"2009-02-13",4.2,"Pours a rich opaque sable with a fine-bubbled light tan head. Rich aroma is smoky and has an undertone of fine roast coffee. Mouth-filling flavor is smoky and has a strong coffee undertone, as well as hints of toffee and licorice. Texture is pleasingly smooth and lively, leaving a roast coffee finish.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

3113,"2009-02-09",3.8,"Growler. Aroma of smoke (meats and firewood), earthy hops, distinct malty sweetness, grapey almost. Flavor filled with rich, sweet-sweet malt, earthiness remains, smoke (mostly meaty now) combines with tart notes for a pronounced finish. Oil-slick mouthfeel. Very tasty.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
3113,"2009-02-09",4.0,"Growler from Big Z.  Pours black with a small chocolate colored head.  Aroma of light smoke, smoked meats, rich roasted malt, and some bitter chocolate and toffee.  Flavor is sweet smoked meats with roasted malt in the background.  Slightly sweet, but very rich too.  Nice bodied.  Ok, its not my favorite smoked, but its pretty damn good.

3113,"2009-02-08",4.1,"Big thanks to notalush for sharing this bad boy.  Pitch black beer with a very creamy tan-brown head.  Aroma is lovely, sweet cocoa and rich smoky aroma.  Soft charry/roasty flavour as well.  Chewy and sweet but its not sticky or cloying.  Rich smoky sweetness, cocoa and lovely bitter finish.  Rich and smoky flavour with great integration of the smoke and the dark malts.  More stout than porter, but no matter what you call it, its plenty tasty.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3113,"2009-02-07",3.7,"From a growler from Brandon, thanks bud. Light dry, cherry wood smoke in the aroma, subtle and mild but delicious, with gentle porter notes underneath. Reminds me a bit of Bieropholies Calumet Grand Chef, though not quite as strong or expressive in its smoke/porter qualities. Sweetish flavor, a bit too much of the liquid smoke flavor for my tastes, and not enough porter underneath. Solid but not exciting, but still, one of the better smoked porters Ive had. It is clearly a tough style to brew based on how many brewers totally blow it and how many great brewers still have a bit of trouble (like SN).","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3113,"2009-02-07",4.0,"Growler from Big Z - shared with a few folks - dark brown, nearly black, with a clingy, lasting, soapy, tan lace - wonderful balance of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and woodsy campfire smoke in the nose - smooth, creamy mouthfeel - starts off medium chocolate sweetness, followed by dry cocoa, tobacco, mellow but present smoke, and damp charred wood - loads of bittersweet chocolate in the finish, with a nearly tannic quality that rounds things out really nicely - long lingering smoke in the finish - this is a very nice beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3113,"2009-02-07",4.2,"Growler from Big Z.  Hey malrubius, good seeing you again.  Poured opaque with a copper edge and long lasting large tan head.  Lacing and a ring of head lasted for 20 minutes as I drank the first glass.  Nice amount of smoke shows first in the aroma. Roasted malt with a mild-moderate sweetness.  Notes of unground coffee beans.  Chocolate with a light fruit.  Smells a little like those Chunky or Cadbury bars.  Mmmm...Chunkys.  The flavor was a smooth mix of smoke, roasted malt and chocolate.  Dark chocolate rides out the finish.  Mild bitterness and maybe a little hop at the end.  Smooth almost creamy mouthfeel with a medium body.  More warmth than I expected.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
3113,"2009-02-07",4.3,"Rating #600. Growler from Big Z in pint glass.  Black with thick brown head and full lace.  Mild robust chocolate fruit and mild smoky aroma.  Dark chocolate roasted coffee dark fruit and mild smoky flavor.  Medium-full body and medium low carbo.  Rich and luscious, creamy and robust, just not smoky enough.  Even if smoke doesnt dominate the flavor, which it shouldnt, it should be strong in the nose (IMHO).  An excellent strong porter, but not as good as the best smoked porters like Alaskan and Stone.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
3113,"2009-02-02",3.9,"On tap, Taco Mac, Metropolis. Black, thin beige head. Coffee and sausage aroma, maybe a touch of chocolate, too. Flavor is a pretty simple mix of coffee and smoked meat, kind of like a tasty breakfast.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
