2335,"2016-06-10",3.4,"From notes. Enjoyed this one at the Brew Crew Bash in Ann Arbor on May 21. This one was poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a darker fuzzy golden orange with a pretty thick and effervescent off-white colored head that roils down pretty quickly. There are some decent soapy legs left on the glass. The aroma is complex, and strange. There is a strong grapefruit zest up front, but then it fades through a strange Belgian influenced yeast and malt. There is a strong earthiness and a defined spiciness. It¬ís almost like a bright, Belgian champagne. I¬ím not digging it. The flavor mimics this. There is a grapey presence at the front, and then the Belgian yeast and malts just move in. The spicy malt is definitely a turn off here. It¬ís vinous and has a light hop on the back end. It¬ís weird. The mouth feel is a little thinner, but the big champagne carbonation is something I don¬ít care for. I know they¬íre going to something like it, but I¬ím not too keen. The aftertaste is spicy and malty with a hint of acidic citrus. Interesting beer, but it¬ís not my thing.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Very smooth and easy to drink, despite the hop bitterness and high strength. Alcohol is masked well. The hops have a lovely cheesey, cat urine taste/aroma to them (seriously).

>>> Fantastic wine-forward Belgian Strong Ale with a nice fruitiness added by the Riesling grapes. As good as the regular version. 

+  Like the ""regular"" version, this is one of the most ""wine forward"" beer I have ever tasted 
+  The addition of Riesling grapes to an already winey beer makes an interesting result, especially with the aroma where it gave a super perfumy grapes profile
 
+  While it¬ís really complex, it¬ís also rather drinkable for an 9% abv beer.
