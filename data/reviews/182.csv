182,"2015-12-09",3.5,"Pitch black and completely opaque with only the faintest of mahogany edges and a three finger, frothy beige head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting cap/ring. Excellent retention, only slowly settling and completely coating the glass with sheets of soapy lacing on the way down.

Slightly smokey roasted dark malt aroma with a subtle earthy hop presence and sweeter light malts. Slight rauchbier character with charcoal, butane and smoked meat, however, not overwhelmingly smokey. The smoke is countered by delicate earthy hop resins, pine needle and grass. Underneath the smoke and hops, there is a robust dark malt presence with coffee beans, burnt toast, oatmeal and dark chocolate. The heavier roast is countered by sweeter dessert-like dark malts with hints of chocolate cake, toffee and caramel. Very complex with the subtle smoke and hop presence adding nice complexity.

Lighter body than expected with subtle roast and resinous hop bitterness countered by lighter dark malt sweetness. Somewhat watered down which is kind of disappointing but helps drinkability. Slightly smokey with barbecued meat, liquid smoke and delicate charcoal flavor. Faint robust coffee bean flavor along with toast, oatmeal and dark cocoa. Lighter malt sweetness with caramel, toffee and milk chocolate sweetness. Light body and easy to drink with decent hop and smoke flavor but the mouthfeel is weak and the malt bill is slightly one dimensional.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
182,"2014-11-03",3.8,"Tap at FFF. Big steady head on top of a deep brown-black body. Full bodied, rich, roasty chocolate porter. Heavy malts, molasses. Roast coffee tones with the chocolate malts. Far from sessionable, this one took me awhile to finish. Solid flavors, just a little heavy for the ABV. Quality overall.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

Strong floral and citrus hop aromas. Big grapefruit, orange, and tangerine. Flavor is lightly bitter with roasted malt, grapefruit peel, and a hint of coffee. Lots of orange and tangerine. Some cocoa powder and dark chocolate, toffee, and molasses.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
182,"2014-05-20",3.8,"Faint grain with chocolate overtone. A little vegetal hop character in the aroma. Pitch black with a thin head. Chocolaty taste gives way to an oniony flavor. Doesn't sound attractive, but boy, it works well.

Aroma is a very faint roasted malts with a healthy serving of floral, fleshy fruit wet hops. Flavor brings out more of the porter characteristics, with roasted malts, slightly smokey, a touch of fresh fruity hops. Light and drinkable for such a dark beer.

182,"2013-01-28",3.8,"Thought I rated this before.  On tap at the brewpub, mid octoberish.  Brown pour frothy brown cream head.  Very hoppy aroma, citruis and pine.  Smells like an IPA.  Taste is more hops with a bit of choc and roasted malt.  Id venture to say that this is closer to black IPA, but has the thicker body or a well rounded porter.  Very enjoyable.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
182,"2012-11-26",4.6,"Poured on tap at Duke's alehouse crystal lake, Illinois. Pours dark black with one inch head. Smells of roasted grain, grassy. Has immediate roast taste followed by sharp citra twang. A bit toasty and hoppy for a porter, but still a wonder.

182,"2012-11-11",4.0,"On tap @ Publican in Chicago. How is this not a black IPA? Incredibly hoppy porter in true 3F fashion, delicious, incredibly drinkable.

182,"2012-10-26",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a black body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is highly hopped with lots of resiny, juicy grapefruit pines and some tropical floral touches with a heavier roast backing. Good amount of rich chocolates with some toffee as well. Flavor is similar. Lots of juicy, resiny grapefruit and orange pines with some floral tropicals alongside a good amount of roasts. The chocolate really comes on nicely towards the end to help balance the big hop and roast finish as this dries with a moderate bitterness. Medium body and a softer, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty cool porter. Really juicy, resiny, and citrusy with a solid roast and rich chocolate backing. Nice one.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

On tap at brewery.  Entirely opaque black with a light mocha very creamy head with great retention.  At first when at its coolest the pine and grapefruit citrus hop notes preside with coffee in the back ground, then as it warms the hops let the coffee, toasted caramel, and smokey flavors come through.","Park Ridge, Illinois, USA","timc100"

182,"2012-10-20",4.0,"A: Pours a dark black color with a creamy tan head forming on the pour. The edges are very dark cherrywood color when light hits it. The head has some very nice retention and leaves wonderful waves of sticky lace down the glass.

S: The nose comprises of the typical FFF citrus hop profile with a little bit of a milk dud candy malt base to it. Some semi-sweet chocolate is there with a little bit of roast.

T: Theres a minor burst of citrus upfront followed by some heavily roasted malts and some oats as well. Light chocolate flavors with a combination of resinous and citrus hops on the finish. As it warms the hops come out a little more.

M: Medium body with a nice medium carbonation level. The mouthfeel is cream with a slightly drying chalkiness to the finish.

O: The was a great aggressively hopped porter. The mouthfeel keeps it down to earth so it doesnt venture into the ""Black IPA"" territory. Definitely would have again.

Serving type: on-tap

182,"2012-10-08",3.5,"Draft at Three Floyds. Pours basically black with brown at the edges and a tan head. Opaque. Nose is hoppy and fruity, some resiny notes and cocoa. Kind of like an Alpha Klaus light, that I dig. On tasting, more odd. Celery, earthy and roasty overall. Strange celery note coming from the hops here overall.

Pours a deeper cola like consistency, less intense at the edges - more brownish, and topped with a soapy light beige head that reduces down to wispy film... Green hoppy citrusy nose with a nutty roast and cocoa component. Fresh and vibrant... Flavors a continuation of the same with a firm roast and green citrus component.

182,"2012-09-29",3.9,"Draft on tap at the brewpub (Munster, IN). Stop down after work for beer and cheap gas. Pours a richer deeper brown black pour, a good haze, lighter glowing brown copper edges show some fire, reddish ruby glow. A cakey tannish head atop stays as a firm layer, laces ok overall and sticks around as a firm layer. Aromas are blasts of citrusy hops, grapefruit and tropical fruits, florals and grass. Rich seemingly Citra nose gives some oomph and Amarillo comes in more as we work in. Tropical, hoppy fruit melange with lemons and oranges coming in, some toasty malts, roast, and biscuits. Gentle cocoa give some whispers as the nose adjusts to the hops. Fresh and lively. Nose settles down as it warms a bit. Initial offers a contrast of elements. The hop nose fades on flavor, perhaps due to the dry hop contribution. Toasty and cocoa, biscuits and slowly growing roast. Dark chocolate, darker malts, bread, and toffee. Sweeter oats into the middle with flashes of grapefruit and oranges, some florals, roasty and toasty with some sweeter malts, sufficient bitter hopping as the body ends up on the medium end, perhaps a touch more girthy. Some Amarillo gumball like elements at times, as I call them. Cocoa and bakers chocolate, roasty and dry bittersweet cocoa backend. Dryness, florals, citrus and some intervening pine elements. The hops return, synergistic with the roast and cocoa dryness into the back and finish,  a touch resiny, certainly lingering cocoa, roast, florals, and dry citrusy hops, some slight wafts of that tropical and grapefruit nose. A solid beer that has a nose that really seems different than the work as a whole. Fun offering, like the contrast. Nose is great, beer is pretty nice and gives some good contrast of flavors and palate. I can see some people really digging this. Especially the Porter Crowd as it really gives that darker malt slant, the hop profile really gives it something different though","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Fruity-floral-citrus hops as well as that signature 3Fs thing that goes on in the aroma, also some roasty caramel coffee malt. I swear I can smell a 3Fs beer half way across the state.
