383,"2015-11-05",3.8,"Shared at a tasting hosted by Steve Hackley on September 25. Thanks Steve! This was poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour on this is a foggy gold with no head and no lace. Its almost like pouring a light syrup. The aroma is way sour. I dont know that Ive smelled one this intense before. There is a little citrus, some nice funk, and a little wine that shows through on the back end. Its to the point where there is so much sour happening, its almost sweet. Should be interesting. The flavor is pretty disappointing. There is a lacto-induced sourness to start and some of the aiding flavors just fade away. The bright citrus is reserved, its not as sour as the nose would lead on either. The mouth feel is light and crisp, but the lack of carbonation makes it come off a little syrupy. The aftertaste is lingeringly funky and sour with a decent amount of citrus, but it is not what I was hoping for. Upland needs the fruit!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

383,"2015-10-03",3.9,"750 ml bottle Blend 1. Pours a cloudy dark orange color and topped by a small head of off white foam that settles quickly to a thin film and leaves some steaks of lace around the glass. The aroma is of sour citrus, lemon peel, lime, barnyard funk, vinous oak, and lactic sourness. The flavor follows and is really nice and sour with notes of citrus fruit, lemon peel and lime, acetic sourness, and vinous oak. There is a nice lactic sourness as well that keeps things from getting too acetic. Medium bodied with puckering sourness and ample carbonation that leads to a dry, sour citrus finish. I was really surprised by this. Really nice sour beer and hope to try the other blends some day.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
383,"2015-08-23",3.9,"Great Taste of the Midwest, 2015. I am not sure what year this is.

These beers are not lambics and should not be called as such.

A bit acetic, but nothing over the top, citric lemon notes mingle in, with wood, apple cider, and a slick body.

The beer is hazy and light orange colored with a small, fleeting, wispy head. Nice aroma consisting of wild yeast, citrus, grass, wheat. Acetic and lactic feel on the palate with low carbonation. Pretty good flavor. Definitely smells and tastes like an Upland beer. Very good, but not world class. Definitely one of the better gueuze examples to emerge from the U.S.

I timed it perfectly to get a pour from one of a handful of bottles brought to the Great Taste by Upland. This was one of the beers that was worth the price of admission. An excellent world class sour Batch #2 makes me wish I was able to try the first at some point.

Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy golden body was probably partially due to agitation of the bottle. It looked like it tasted - a sharp gueuze in a sample glass. Lemons and a tart vinegary note bit at the senses.

Flavor / Palate - Tart and to the point this was intense from the first sip. I cant imagine drinking an entire bottle alone. The dry finish tastes like a sharp acidic champagne complete with traces of carbonation. Based on this I cant wait until Upland is able to turn their old facility into a full time sour factory.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a nice darker golden muted hue, a bit murky and dark for the color with a decent offwhite frothy head dies to thicker ring, laces ok. Aromas are lemons and yogurt, a light hay and grassy element, some sweeter bread, with more sourness, gentle bretty dryness and funk. Aromas grow a bit more potent as it warms, the brett and sour lemon comes forward, the yogurt comes a bit forward too, but lemony sourness and lactic acid grows. Brett offers healthy cheesiness, Bleu cheese, barnyard, with a touch of a warning of acedic elements. Initial is a nice bite of sourness up front, lemons and crab apples mix with lactic acidity, touches of hay, some oranges, and grass. Sourness bites, but falls back into the middle, throwing some touches of brett, hay, and straw. Sourness keeps on keeping on, nothing overbearing or acedic. Really nice sour bite, as the finish leaves some dryness, yogurt, and more sourness lingering into the finish. Brett plays second fiddle here, sourness asserting itself, with a touch of body so as not to be a one trick pony. Finish has touches of dough and dry bread, some sourdough elements. Dry and sour. My only qualm might be the Brett falling a little too far back. Sour and potent, but not overbearing into the overly acedic side. A funky nose but not into the body. A very nice beer, but lacks the complexity the nose seemed to promise. Still its tasty, providing a bite of sourness.
