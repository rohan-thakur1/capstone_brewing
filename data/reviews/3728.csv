3728,"2009-04-05",3.9,"Tap at SPH. Aroma of caramel, toffee, big nougat malt, all malt, all rich, all sweet. Flavor the same, so rich, nougaty, and sweet, but appropriately so, never sugary or cloying. Rich and luscious.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
3728,"2008-02-25",3.7,"Draught at SPH Brew Pub. Deep red pour with a wispy head. Aroma was malty and hops. Flavour was similar with a bit of roasted hops and a bitter/dry finish.","Long Island, New York, USA","WhiteAlePower"
3728,"2007-06-03",3.6,"Pour seemed to look a bit darker than the picture to the left- light thin foamy creamy grayish head, slight lace.  Aroma is toasted malts, light munich, sharp lightly metallic caramel malts, and floral and tea-like hops.  Somewhat weaker flavor, toast, metallic malts, light sweetness- some nuttiness, and an earthy bitter finish.  Pretty smooth though.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3728,"2007-03-31",3.2,"Tap at SPH - Dark amber, creamy white head.  Nose held soft notes of toasted chocolate and florals. Malty flavor up front is well balanced by the soft hoppy bitterness.  Light to medium bodied, light carbonation, soft bittersweet finish.  Very drinkable...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
3728,"2007-03-18",3.7,"On tap at the SPH. Pours a lovely red with a thin white head that receded to a ring. Light malt in the aroma along with some brwon sugar. The flavor was also somewhat malty. The sweetness detected in the nose has a much lighter presence in the flavor. Well proportioned hoppy finish. Very quaffable brew.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
3728,"2006-04-03",3.7,"Tap at the brewery.  Dark brown beer with a thin white head.  Sweet toasty aroma, some nice bready, crackery malts.  A bit of brown sugar and light molasses.  Flavour is fairly sweet with toasty rye-like notes.  Nice malty complexity without being overly sweet.  Soft earthiness and a light herbal flavour as well.  Toasted nuts and faint anise.  Very nice brew.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3728,"2004-05-25",3.5,"On tap at The Gate.  Poured deep orange/red copper, aroma was some hops.  Taste had hops at the front then almost a pause and then some hops near the end. Smooth and fairly basic.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","Shadrach"
3728,"2004-05-16",2.9,"Deep copper color with a smallish head. Not too much going on for an Irish Ale. Lively mouthfeel with a sharp hop bite and not too much malt to balance it out.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
3728,"2004-05-03",3.8,"On tap at David CopperfieldÂ’s.  Damn nice beer, pours an amber red with a white head of substantial rocky, mountainous foam.  Aroma is grainy, grassy and lightly redolent of burnt molasses.

Medium palate, smooth and roasty in flavor.  More in the wasy of lightly burnt grrains, and a caramel flourish.  Finishes cleanly and drily.  Exceptionally drinkable.","New York, USA","DCopperfields"
3728,"2004-03-25",3.1,"Ruby red with amber streaks and a fluffy white head.  An easy drinking amber colored beer with average malt character and light hops.  Toffee and whole grains in the malt with slightly bitter, non-descript hops.  Fairly dry in the finish.  Clearly not the most exciting offering from SPH.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3728,"2003-05-30",3.0,"Strongly sweet, hints of tobacco in the nose, creamy/buttery palate at the front but somewhat thin on the end.  Decent, but I'm not going to make a fuss about it.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3728,"2003-03-21",3.9,"A nice-looking Irish Red beer.  A dry beer, with some roastiness and maltiness present.  Again, this Southampton beer is very easy to drink!  Yet, there is nothing in particular worth noting.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
3728,"2003-03-21",3.9,"A great red irish ale, and I'm not a big fan of these either.  Perfect red/copper color, slight malts in the nose.  Highly wheaty and malty at the same time.  An irish ale like I have never had.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
