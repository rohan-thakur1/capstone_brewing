781,"2017-02-23",2.7,"(bottle) hazy brown colour with a small off white head; faint aroma of banana, spice; balanced, rather weak flavour, no finish; far below better examples of the style",", Ontario, CANADA","thorongil2"
781,"2017-01-06",3.4,"Bottle - 500ml. Cloudy brown body with an average, slowly fading, off-white foamy head. Well balanced malty aroma with hoppy, banana, and some spicy hints. Its decent malty taste carries woody, spicy, and chocolate notes. Ends with a decent bittersweet finish. Enjoyable.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
781,"2016-10-25",4.0,"Out of the bottle, poured a cloudy amber-brown. I got classic hefe aromas of banana and clove, along with butterscotch toffee, and raisin. On the palate, roasted/caramelized notes kick in giving the impression of baked banana bread. Off-dry finish, to be expected from the style. I quite enjoyed this.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","MattChiasson"
781,"2016-08-02",3.6,"Bottle from the Beer Store. Murky dark amber with a one finger khaki head that fades quickly to a sheet. Patchy lace. Nose is spice, dark fruit, bread, some light banana and grains. Flavour has more banana up front with light cloves lingering in the background. Lightly sweet fruit and caramel malts with some tartness in the finish. Medium body with soft carbonation.

781,"2016-06-27",3.4,"Pours murky brown with an off white head. Aroma is grain, toasted wheat and dark fruits. Sweet malt, grain and banana flavours with a medium body.  Good beer.","Ontario, CANADA","ChadPoole"
781,"2015-12-06",3.6,"Growler from Summerhill LCBO. Pours a murky orange/brown with smallish eggshell-coloured head. Aroma is bananay eaters, toasty wheat, dark fruit, spice and earthiness. Flavour is quite substantial banana with some caramel notes, toasted wheat, prune, clove and a bit of earthy character. Mellow carbonation. Rather good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Spab"
781,"2015-09-13",3.9,"On tap at Cody Inn, Buckhorn ON. Tall weizen glass, cloudy brown with a 1.5"" head that lasted all the way to the bottom. Aromas of spices (clove and nutmeg), fruit and grain. Flavours of banana, currants and dried figs over signature wheat maltiness. Sweet with a slightly tart finish, medium carbonation. Very enjoyable, but like every other Dunkelweizen Ive ever had it gave me a headache (seriously, no other beer does this to me, but Dunkels do it every time). Worth the couple of Advil to have tried it, though.","Les Coteaux, Quebec, CANADA","Metalflake"
781,"2015-08-03",3.4,"[7394-20150719] Tap. Cigarette smoky grains aroma. Slightly hazy, amber orange body with a medium-lasting for off-white head. Malty sweet grains flavour has a light fruity aftertaste. Medium body. Average. (7/3/7/3/14) 3.4

781,"2015-07-27",3.2,"2015-07-19. Hazy dark amber body with modest off-white head and lace. 3++ Aroma is lightly dusty, with notes of toasty malt. Flavour is malty, with surprising toasty dry malt notes. Not a ton of weizen ester character makes it past the malt. Smooth average plus bodied. Decent but not really to my own tastes. On tap at the brewpub, Peterborough.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
781,"2015-07-15",3.4,"500 ml bottle from the brewery, served cold in a tulip glass. Cloudy deep brown with a fluffy tan head. Nice banana esters, decent clove spiciness, light fruity tang, some dark dried fruit character, dark bread crust, a touch roasted (appropriate?). Medium body, fairly lively carbonation. Banana, lighter clove, dark dried fruit, faint roasted malt, a touch fruity; slightly off-dry with minimal bitterness and a banana and rich malty finish. Pretty good, except for the roasted character.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
781,"2015-06-23",3.5,"One of the better brews Ive had to come out of this brewery. Pours a cloudy brownish colour. Has a yeasty and dark fruit aroma with a hint of chocolate and stewed prunes. Medium bodied brew with a fast profile. Tartness is balanced by a bit of chocolate sweetness and sports a bit of toasty bite as well. Decent.","Canadiana, Ontario, CANADA","Bendrixian"
781,"2015-02-08",3.4,"Feb. 8, 2015. In Januarys Brew Box. Bottle. Roasted malt, biscuit aromas. Opaque dark brown with whitish head. Roasted cofee, malt, toffee and biscuit flavours. Much better than the other Smithworks weve had in the Brew Box.","","crazy_cat_lady"
781,"2014-11-23",3.7,"500 mL bottle from the brewery. Pours dark, dark, hazy auburn with a medium beige head. Nice looking beer. Classic German yeast in the nose, led by bubblegum and banana. There is a mild spiciness underneath, but the yeast dominates. The dark malt adds some depth to the flavour of the hefe, with some cola sweetness and a little dried apple. Medium body. Very drinkable.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"
781,"2014-11-14",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2015 500ml bottle from the brewery. Huge beige/off-white foamy head. Quite dark and cloudy, but still seems quite visually effervescent. Notes of chocolate with lots of banana- the aroma is very yeast heavy in a nice way, doughy and earthy. Medium bodied and quite sessionable, great winter beer for these guys. Great launch time. Medium PB as some chocolate on the finish is matched with an appropriate amount of bitterness.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","gregorymconway"
