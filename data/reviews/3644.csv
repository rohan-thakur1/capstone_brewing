3644,"2017-06-20",4.1,"On tap @ The Growler. This is a cloudy looking one, almost a little murky and deep plum brown in colors. On the top a medium sized dense beige heavy lacing head. Really like the nose. Its both a little sourish and very malt caramelly sweet. Loaded with dried fruits, vanilla, wood, berries and malt biscuits. Smells really nice. Sugary sweet at times but not cloying at all. Yeah, mine kind of aroma. Tastes wonderful. Dried and really berry sweet. Blue and blackberries with those small sweet plums. Its thick and oily in the mouth while soft gentle on the prickling carbonation. A little licorice, tones of cigar, some tarmac, vanilla and a lovely intense dried fruity finish containing dates ang figs. A beautiful one. 19.06.2017","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Paradiso says this one is the 7th anniversary beer & poterie is 8th. Lovely quad but a bit too bubbly for the style. Nearly 17%. Foggy color so unfiltered? Cinnamon nose. Coats the young but flavor strongest on the edges. Wonderful, slightly sharp, very durable after taste

3644,"2017-03-08",3.9,"Tasted as part of a 7 year Bruery vertical, so its somewhat hard to give a rating, considering that most of the beers are aliased. So, here are my impressions:
Papier: Quite oxidized, which dominates the flavor. Still, its enjoyable as an old ale, and the malts still give off a nice toffee impression.:
Coton: Much less oxidized. Smooth and sweet, without really any heat from the alcohol. Drinks really nicely.
Cuir: This is probably right at the ""sweet spot,"" at 5.5 years. No real oxidization, but all of the alcohol and hop bitterness from some of the younger batches is also tempered. Great, rich malty profile.
Fruet:Similar to Cuir, and also drinking nicely right now. Slightly perceptible hop bitterness.
Bois: Noticeably more aggressive than the batches from earlier years. Some alcohol heat coming through.
Sucre::The smooth malt sweetness from the earlier batches has been completely overwhelmed by alcohol at this point. Bitter and hot. 
Cuivre: Even after a night of drinking big, flavorful beers, this made a strong assault on everyones taste buds. Its over a year old, but the individual flavor threads (Malt, hop, esters, alcohol) are too overpowering. Hot -- give it a few more years!
What did I learn from drinking this many Bruery anniversary beers in one night? They definitely benefit from some aging -- Id say that 4 to 6 years is probably their sweet spot, with the heat from the 15%+ ABV giving way to some nice sweetness at that point. Oh, and dont do a tasting this intense on a Thursday.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3644,"2017-03-07",4.5,"(from memory, drank on March 2, 2017)

Visual: Hefty bottle. Pours root beer brown with a smallish head, mild activity.

Nose: Intense chocolate, butterscotch-toffee, wickedly aromatic (lvl-10)-pungency

Attack: slightly fizzy, thicker viscosity, rich intense impression

Mid-palate: butterscotch, (lvl-8-sweetness), vanilla, toffee, liquid barley malt, bourbon, root beer

Finish: licorice, chocolate, background woodiness, controlled alcoholic heat

Summary: Super body, balanced, sippable, and should be shared among friends and family. This drinks unlike any of the 1100 beers Ive tried - a wrecking ball of intensity yet still balanced enough not to be harsh. I probably say this only once it a year but this is something I would like to try again.","","sulawang"

3644,"2016-03-01",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2016 At Bruery Sucré Tasting in Bruges, revisited at Hopishops B.U.M.B. tasting event in Antwerp. Probably an alias of Cuivre, but since the ABV is slightly different, I risked adding it as a separate entry - please do correct me if Im wrong. Looks identical to Bruery Sucré Rum Barrel Aged. Aroma very similar to that version as well, but with softer hints of sweet corn and obviously (a lot of) bourbon; more vanilla tannins as well, and perhaps slightly more outspoken hints of amaretto, white port wine and hazelnut oil. In the mouth, it comes closer to the Rye Whisky version, but a tad sweeter, more astringent in terms of alcohol and with, unsurprisingly, a strong bourbon flavour in the finish.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Kólaszínű testet emlegetni egy efféle kaliberű főzet esetében talán szentségtörésnek tűnhet, a mélygesztenye karakter és a hamar elillanó habgyűrű jól ismert vendégek a magas alkoholtartalmú, nehéz formátumú amerikai darabok esetében. Marcipánmasszás bevonattal átszőtt fahordós, átütő erejű alkoholos aromái semmi esélyt nem hagynak a nyugalomra, szinte felperzselik a levegőt a whiskys illatjegyek. Nincs más hátra, mint hogy olajos és izgalmakkal teli kortyaiba vessük magunkat, melyeket csupán jelzés értékkel szellősít meg egy szerény szánsavháló. Kirobbanó erejű, mégis mérnöki módon megszerkesztett karakter, melyet nem győzünk csodálni, erejének nagysága miatt azt várjuk, mikor hatalmasodik el az alkoholfok okozta élmény az ízkompozíció összeszedettségén; a rendezettség azonban nemigen akar szűnni, a hatalmas energia kordában van tartva. Modernebb hangulattal átitatott, nemes quadrupel jellemvonásai elevenednek meg, vaníliás-fás karakter érett zamatai mazsolás, szilvabefőttes, tonnás súlyú ízjegyekkel találkoznak. A végletekig érett gyümölcsök legjava komoly alkoholok jótékony pártfogásában teljesedik ki, kókuszos tejcsokoládé színesíti a testet, majd egy hosszú utóéletű, sötét hangulatban vibráló likőrösen karcos jelleg teszi fel a koronát a feledhetetlenül egyedi kompozícióra. Az efféle italok a sörös tapasztalatok mérföldköveiként szolgálnak, általuk új szintre helyezhetjük a különböző típusú főzetekről alkotott képünk minőségét.

3644,"2014-12-30",2.9,"750ml bottle (Bois) into a tulip. From notes.

A: Pours a murky dark brown color. Theres a one finger khaki head that retains horribly - in other words, par for the course from a 15% monster. No lacing is left behind, either.

S: Very intense, mostly in a good way. The vanilla is huge, the bourbon is huge, the oaky notes are huge, and the dark fruits are huge. I even get some faint coconut touches. On the first whiffs, the booze is very intense, only to calm down as it warms up. My subconscious tells me the actual flavor is going to be WAY too sweet, but even still, this aroma works well.

T: Dark fruits open this one up in a big way. It doesnt take long, however, to realize just how fuckin sweet this one is. Holy shit, this is like drinking bourbon spiked with brown sugar - about six tbsps worth, to be precise. The finish tries to negate all dat sugar with some oaky and bourbon-y notes; its not particularly successful. All it really does is inject a bit of unnecessary harshness into the massively cloying beer without really balancing it out. On the plus side, it *does* become slightly less harsh as more is imbibed. That does NOT make all the ridiculous sweetness any more palatable: its far too moronic and out-of-wack throughout. Its not even that complex, either.

M: This practically burns going down. Cripes on a stick, this one feels rough. Its too carbonated, too thin, and too sweet all at the same time. It seems like The Bruery was trying to give this good drinkability for the style, and they honestly succeeded - but at what cost? The slender feel clashes badly with the incredible sweetness, so its not like its that drinkable.

O: When I sip this, Im seriously contemplating dumping it - its that overwhelming. This is a textbook example of a beer thats over-the-top big in all the wrong ways. A big beer thats structured well can be a beautiful thing (see: Black Albert), and this just isnt. Its not HORRIBLE per se, just hugely disappointing for over $30 (!) a bottle.

Touch of vanilla & deep, dark fruits. Taste coats the palate with warm booze, sticky toffee coated plums, caramelized dates, raisin preserves, bourbon pungency... Wow. Touch of nutty oak, some woody brown sugar, & burnt toffee lingers in the finish. Sticky body, heavy & thick. Coating. Gets a bit hot as it warms, but certainly a lovely sipper.

Toffee, raisin, plum, molasses, anise, hot wood, & strong booze. Burnt brown sugar, light vanilla. Flavorful, sure, but hard to drink more than a couple ounces. [7-3-5-3-12; 3.0 overall]

Flavor is nice with a bit of vanilla, toffee candy, tart redcurrant, prune, raisin, mild vanilla, faint cocoa powder, woody caramel, even a touch of black cherry. Light booziness with a finish of some bourbon warmth, sticky residual caramel, & chunky toffee coated prunes. This is probably the best version of this beer Ive had. Wow. Great. [8-4-8-4-16]

3644,"2014-09-29",2.8,"My Bottom Line:
Severely oxidized, and not harmoniously so, this strong ale struggles to plow beyond simple fruity sugars and powerful alcohol heat for a most disappointing sipping experience.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the misty copper.
-This strangely lacks malt flavors; its all alcohol, residual sugars and oxidation.
-The alcohol blast cannot be that of an all-malt brew.
-Drinkability is extremely low, but mostly because of this beers lack of flavor interest.
-The oxidation is voluntary here (its too intense not to be?), but it doesnt work much with the grain bill or general flavors generated by the brew. One of the worst quality/price ratios Ive seen in the world of beer.

3644,"2014-08-02",3.8,"8/02/2014: Bruery Sucre (Bourbon)... Well, I have the privilege of tasting 3 different versions of this side by side, so Im going to record my notes for all and copy and paste them as appropriate... All are fairly sweet and malty. The regular (bourbon) one is a bit syrupy and VERY malty and sweet. The bourbon cuts through, but its a bit like sweet and on sweet and not much else. The Tequila one is definitely distinct. Agave in the nose hits first, followed by the same in the flavor, but thats not a bad thing. It actually helps take some of the sweetness out, but introduces that distinct dry agave/tequila flavor that I dont necessarily dig that much. So, that leaves the New American Oak... It too is sweet, but there is a unique smokiness about that it that I particularly like which is odd considering that I dont think this one was aged on charred wood. Regardless, the sweetness is cut a bit and thats good in my book. Its also a bit less thick and heavy. That seems to work with this beer.

Bourbon is definitely very prominent in the taste, with some dark fruits and almost licorice elements in the flavor as well.

3644,"2014-05-26",3.8,"Disclaimer: for a long time, I was actually slightly skeptical of this brewery, however, today, I cracked this old ale for the unofficial day of Summer over my fire pit and I think I was more than enthralled.
I couldnt find a date, however, I did buy this last Autumn of 2013.
I poured this into a snifter.
Gee Weez, $30 at Breeze In, Juneau, AK, is that how it always is every where else or is it typical Southeast Alaska pricing? Hmmm... well here goes.
The appearance was a super nice dark brown close to black color with a slightly half finger white to off white foamy head that concaves and leaves barely anything in the center of the brew. Holy Be-jeebers, actually, I believe I liked this show.
The smell, whoah, how the hell do I explain this one. Okay, its a sort of a cherry to almond to oaky/woodiness and then leading onto a slightly vanilla sort of aroma all delicately packed together and inviting me towards a finer quality of leading me on and into the night of Memorial Day.
The taste is sweet and oaky/woody and it leaves a fairly sweet vanilla-like quality of an aftertaste and then ends up leading to a semi-dry yet sweet but not watery finish. I say that because theres something I had about this beer that seemed to show a fairly watery finish. No worries.
On the palate, it sits about a medium to heavy on the body and shows a decent sessionable quality running about the mouth and tongue. The carbonation is decent for the Old Ale style and good for me as theres just enough harshness pervading the tongue but not overbearing.
Overall, in my opinion, this is actually an exceptionally well done Old Ale that I would more than worthy welcome again. Is it up there with Smuttynoses Really Old Brown Dog Ale, which is actually one the best that Ive tried to this date? Hmmm...well, to pay $30 to have this again, or ask for a Really Old Brown Dog Ale. Ill take Smuttynoses even though I havent had that in a super long time. Personally, though Im glad I tried this, the prices of this brewerys beers need to be brought down. Im not sure who these brewers think they are in this brewery. But hey, Im glad I tried it, but I will never pay $30 for this ever again!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Look: very dark amber. Poured with nick thick, surprisingly big head with even bubbles. Fast retention. Low carbonation. Very nice, promising, inviting.


Smell: Cant miss the big brandy notes. Then come the fruity ones - raisins, deep dark fruits. Reminds me of raisins in rum. Lots of sweet caramel malt with some smokey notes. There is a slight alcohol note. And there comes a very nice subtle sour, tart aroma - lifts up the whole experience. 


Taste: Porto, plum wine, dates. Huge malt, middle a lot of caramel, smokey, burnt wood/sugar. Low on bitterness, but very nice sour after-mid taste. Also some funk in there. Rich and complex.


Mouthfeel: Medium/full body, low carbonation. Very smooth, plate fullness, syrupy. There is some warming effect from high alcohol content, but overall the high alcohol is very well hidden. Leaves you slightly dry. 


Overall: Rich and complex, very strong with a lot to offer, yet balanced, gentle and rewarding. Am thinking to buy a bottle and let it rest for a few years, a little age can probably take this beer even higher.","SLOVENIA","tmzl"

3644,"2013-06-28",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2013 Absolutely incredible offering from a brewery not unfamiliar with incredible offerings.

Cognac colored syrupy pour with about a finger of head that quickly dissipated.

Insanely complex aroma (and flavors) of dark chocolate, port, sherry, bourbon, molasses, maple ,touch of peat smoke, caramel, toffee, plum, Mandarine orange, kumquat, tangerine, cherry, breadfruit, mango, starfruit, raisin, kiwi, and lime. This creation definitely reminds me of Sam Adams Millenniums slightly trimmer brother. Despite the high level of sweetness, on so many levels, there is a distinctive citric hoppiness that manages to assert itself at the tail end of each sip. There is more than a bit of heat, but much of it contributes to the flavor dynamic, and adds a pleasant warmth, rather than coming off as harsh. I have no doubt that a few years of cellaring would result in an absolute masterpiece.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"

3644,"2012-11-16",3.9,"2012 bottle.
Appearance: The body is a beautiful dark brown, it appears clear but its hard to tell, there is almost no head, just a thin tan head with poor retention.
Aroma: The aroma is very heavy on oak, very woody, light bourbon notes, hints of vanilla, almost all barrel here, but theres some dark fruits as well, grapes come to mind.
Taste: This is dominated by dark fruits, black cherries, grapes, very wine-like. The barrel notes are very tame compared to the aroma, oak is throughout with some bourbon and light vanilla on the finish, warming alcohol goes down the throat.
Palate: Thick and very lightly carbonated.
Overall: This is very winey and I like it, this is complex and a very good sipper, my biggest gripe with this is the price and getting the wax off. I have another bottle Ill age for a while and see how it turns out.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Aroma is awesome--full of rich artisan caramel and wood; also in there: licorice, booze, dark fruit. This is my favorite type of aroma in a beer right now. Taste is a sledgehammer of awesome flavors; its sweet (not cloying), sour, very savory. The bourbon and oak are in your face, but not overpowering. Alcohol burns the throat going down. Licorice is strong in the finish. Soft carbonation, full-bodied, velvety mouthfeel. This reminds me of Firestone Walker 14, also an anniversary beer, which is my favorite beer of all time.

7/24/13 rating, as Bois: 750 ml wax-dipped bottle. 15% ABV. This is the beer to celebrate four years of rating on this site. Pours a muddy dark brown with orange highlights; has a medium beige head with decent retention. Aroma is oaky, boozy, caramellly, raisins, licorice, sticky buns. Taste starts out sweet and savory before quickly turning sour, leaving a little bitterness behind in the finish. Hot alcohol. Mouthfeel is oily, carbonation fairly soft, body full. I drank this too soon, dammit. I rated Fruet after six months of aging. This one has only been a couple months since production. That hot alcohol definitely needs to tame down a bit. Im really kicking myself for not buying another bottle. Give this one at least six months, but I think a year or more would be best. At least I know for next year. 8,3,8,5,16=4.0

3rd rating, from 7/25/15, as Sucre, 2014 vintage: at least a year old here. 750 ml wax-dipped bottle. Aroma is dark fruits, caramel, molasses, licorice. Pours muddy brown with a medium beige head that falls after a couple minutes into a ring and skiff of foam. Taste is sweet, boozy, coconut, dark fruits imparting some tartness, tannins. Full-bodied, velvety mouthfeel. Great beer, but its just not as interesting as my first impression back in 2012 when it was called Fruet. I dont know if the quality has gone down, if my tastes have changed, or if I was just more in the mood for this behemoth of a beer back then when I rated it for the first time. 8,4,8,5,18=4.3","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

A: Pours a dark cherry and brown body with some dark orange edges. Crazy combo. A light tan head forms on the pour and dissipates to a bubbly ring that leaves some splotches of lace.

S: Light bourbon and oak upfront with some candied sugar, dark fruits and some back end sweet caramel.

T: The taste is a little more barrel forward than the nose, but the sweet caramel flavors really cut into it. There is a light leathery component in addition to some candied figs that really add another layer flavor.

M: Slight chewy with medium carbonation. The body isnt too heavy and for 15.5% this is surprisingly drinkable.

O: The barrel aging thin the body just enough to make this scarily drinkable for 15.5%. I really dont think the beer needs much time for the heat to die down and the flavor to integrate. Id sit on this guy a little longer and thats it.

3644,"2012-04-25",4.1,"Poured into a snifter. Bottle number 1,227 of Barrel Aged Cuir. Big thanks to Callmecoon for this. 

5.0 A: Dark brown color. Two and a half fingers of tan creamy/frothy head. Retention is infinitely impressive for a beer of this magnitude. It stays around a long ass time. A small ring of lacing is left.

4.5 S: That additional 70% in a barrel makes all the difference. This reeks of bourbon and fortunately the barrel aging was done extremely well. Leathery, peat, and spicy with melon and apple fruitiness. Somehow very minimal booze. Underneath there is brown sugar, caramel, plum and raisin fruitiness. The base beer comes off a lot more mellow that the regular Cuir, which is mellow to begin with. Still, very nice.

4.5 T: Like the nose, the bourbon makes its presence known. Same flavors as in nose. However, the base beers is allowed to come out and it comes out strong. Tons of brown sugar to start. Raisin, plum, tobacco, date, and fig fruitiness. Caramel, molasses, vanilla, oak. Somehow this is less boozy than the regular. The only thing preventing this from getting that perfect score is the sweetness. Theres simply too much of it. But, that is the way of the Bruery.

4.0 M: Heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy. Chewy with a mild amylase build-up. 

4.0 D: Very tasty sipper/desert beer. A bit sweeter than I prefer, but sometimes you are in the mood for something like that. Tonight is one of those nights.

Creamy with a medium level carbonation, and a body on the full side. Given the 14.5% ABV though, ""on the full side"" is pretty light. There is a grainy nature to it.

3644,"2012-01-06",3.4,"100% Bourbon Barrel Aged Cuir
A vigorous pour into my Lost Abbe Teku glass produces a three-finger thick, relatively large bubbled, creamed-amber tinged head.  The beer is a darkish amber color that shows a hazed, opaque, amber hue when held up to the light.  My first smell of the aroma has me noticing notes of toasted, sweetened coconut, lots of vanillin, ample vanilla-scented toffee and caramelized grain.  My second smell has me noticing more of the spicy oak, toasted wood notes and definite Bourbon like aromatics.  This makes me think of some sort of Bourbon soaked, caramelized grain type sweet, holiday cake / bread.  Quite rich and satiating smelling, and without a huge, hot alcohol note; I was a little timid of this bee, as I thought it would be overly boozy, but this mostly manages to not be (at least in the nose).

Lightly sweet up front, along with a sort of tart, bourbon like note, the finish has a lot more sweetness to it though with a rich, caramelized type of character that really accentuates a sweet, lightly toasted coconut and vanillin character.  This beer is quite smooth, there is a touch of alcohol warmth, but it is kept well in check; there is definitely a bourbon flavor here, smooth, but warming, tart, lots of oak flavors and even some fruit-like Bourbon notes. The finish has a spiciness, redolent of oak, astringent oak and hop bitterness that adds some bite, but really the smoothness from the toffee / caramel an sweetness is the dominant note here.  Not overly thick, or chewy for its strength, this is most definitely a sipping brew as it has a dense, palate coating viscosity, but it doesnt seem overly heavy or rich somehow.

Surprisingly, this is much better than I was expecting; I was expecting to actually not like this, not only am I not hating this, it is actually quite good.  Really the surprise is that it is so smooth, and so well integrated and not nearly as hot as it should be.  Despite being quite drinkable now, this will get a lot better with age, and perhaps a lot of it.  Richness, roundness, complimentary oxidation, and a needed complexity should come with age, and I would guess that this could go for a lot longer than I would expect; this beer might even have the potential to go for a long, long time.  It should at least go for 5 years with improvement, and, assuming it doesnt fall apart for unexpected reasons it should go a lot longer; hold on to a bunch and sample over the next 50 years.  Currently it is a bit simplistic, but, like I said, I expect some age to make this even better.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3644,"2010-12-01",4.3,"Big thanks to bmanning for sharing this bottle. Great presentation with the cotton bag, which led to some fairly interesting speculation as to the design of later barrel-aged anniversary series beers. The beer itself pours a murky red-brown with a tan head. A bit of lacing, which is impressive for a beer of such heft. Smells nice with good amounts of caramel, sweet malt, toffee, and some raw, dark sugar. Hints of oak are present, but are more detectable in the mouthfeel. Taste is quite similar to the nose, with the oak a bit more pronounced. Low carbonation and fairly heavy, although surprisingly drinkable given the ABV on this. Very nice beer and, IMO, much more drinkable than the standard version at this point.

Pours a murky chestnut brown, not quite black inn the glass, with a surprisingly big head.  It doesnt stick around long though and leaves no lacing, just lots of sticky legs.

Aroma is massive and fills up the room with bourbon and all manner of sweetness - vanilla, caramel, molasses, chocolate.  There is some Esther and tobacco as well as an alcohol burn in the nostrils.

The taste is more of the same and just over-the-top sweet. Chocolate, caramel and caramelized brown sugar with butterscotch and vanilla.  The knish burns with booze, lots of bourbon.

The mouthfeel is full and sticky with the sugars just clinging to the palate alongside the boozy burn.  Bit of oak in the finish.

This is certainly a massive, complex and tasty brew, but its just so damn sweet.  Drinkability is not the strong suit here.  Dont get me wrong, its pretty drinkable for the ABV but drinking more than one glass isnt easy.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3644,"2010-05-23",4.3,"A: The pour is a muddled dark brown color with a surprising amount of off-white head on top which sticks around nicely.

S: A really rich, sweet aroma fills the nose. I pick up lots of vanilla, maple syrup, burnt sugar, caramel, and toffee as I give it a deep sniff. The bourbon is present, but not completely overwhelming, and the wood character is somewhat minimal.

T: The sweetness follows on the palate as the burnt sugar, caramel, and vanilla attack the tongue. A touch of dark fruits combines with vanilla and maple syrup and works surprisingly well. There is certainly some booze present, but its not really hot.

M: The body is thick and full, with a minimal carbonation. The beer is sticky and chewy on the tongue.

D: This is dangerously easy to drink. I had several glasses of this fine libation and found it to be absolutely delicious and I really look forward to opening some of my bottles.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3644,"2010-01-19",3.9,"Bottle poured into glass at The Bruery Reserve Society Initiation.  Thanks to our massive beer-pooling efforts and relentless attacks on the tasting table, we were able to amass quite a bit of each -bal aged Papier incarnation.  Bourbon was my least favorite of the -bal aged versions, but hey, thats like picking the biggest wimp in a roomful of Chuck Norris clones, is it not?  Pours a cloudy brown color, pretty similar to the color of one of those bears that you see on the Discovery Channel grabbing at salmon as they try to jump up a waterfall.  Unlike those bears, this beer does not have a head.  Pretty flat-looking.  Smells of sweet caramel and toffee, bourbon, vanilla, spice, and oak.  Flavor is nice and tasty, with -bal aging evident.  Theres lots of bourbon in there for sure.  Also caramel, toffee, vanilla, mild oak, raisin cake, and pie spices.  A little on the hot side, but not terribly.  Definitely smoother and mellower than regular Papier, although not nearly as much so as Brandy & Rye Papier.  Body is fairly full and carbonation level is low, although not quite Angels Share low.  (Side note: I just tried the latest release of Angels Share and its actually carbonated, so this is the last flat Angels Share joke I plan on making!  Congrats, Tomme!)  The low carbonation works well in this beer.  Really smooth on the palate, although not quite as smooth as the other -bal aged versions, which are at Rico Suavé levels of smoothness.  Overall a really solid beer, one I feel very lucky to have tried.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Shared with a small group at Mikes apartment this was a decent barrel aged beer but due to the high alcohol or time involved was not as good as the other things opened that night.  With some time to mellow out it may improve while still retaining some of the richness that shows the Bruery can crank out some great beers.

Aroma / Appearance - Flat with a caramel tinted head I was not expecting much from something that billed itself at 16% ABV.  Any carbonation is a surprise at that point.  The nose was mostly caramel syrup and vanilla with bourbon in the background.  The total impression was actually a bit like Southern Tiers Creme Brulee amped up a few degrees to give more punch.

Flavor / Palate - Caramel and cinnamon red hots hit the tongue in a wave of sweetness that is offset by the vanilla and oak seconds later.  Lingering on the throat this one sticks around for quite a while.  More balance around the edges would improve the experience here considerably.  Perhaps that will come with time - if I happen across another bottle in a year or so I would definitely revisit this one.  Overall it takes what seems to be a solid base and supplements it with quality time in a barrel.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3644,"2009-05-17",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2012 Fruet (100% Bourbon Barrel Aged) on Tap at 38 Degrees and in Bottle form.
Appearance:  Pours a murky light brown with visible rising carbonation. No head, just a pin stripe around the top of the glass.

Aroma:  Maple sugar, bourbon, marmalade.

Taste:  Bourbon, chocolate, booze soaked barrel, maple sugar.

Mouthfeel:  Full bodied. Moderate carbonation.

Overall:  The most balanced, most drinkable batch of 100% Barrel Aged Anniversary Ale yet. While Ive enjoyed every years batch, its been undoubtebly been pegged as a big sweet,over the top bourbon bomb.  This years was so much more refined (or as refined as a 15.5% abv beer can be) and I perceived it as a whole new beer.

BA Cuir from Bottle at TFPHQ
Appearance: Pours brown with a thin creamy cap for head.

Aroma: Caramel, maple syrup, chocolate  cereal, leather bound book.

Taste: Golden grahams cereal. Vanilla, bourbon, apple crisp, bitter hops.finishes with maple syrup.

Mouthfeel:  Thick and syrupy with creamy carbonation.

Overall: Of note, this is the first time Ive had the anniversary beer from the bottle, as Ive been saving previous years for a special occasion.  This beer is insanely sweet and alcoholic, and has its rightful place in small taster glasses, and split between a room of people. Very complex, decadent, and strong by strong ale standards.

BA Coton:On tap at 2nd Anniversary Party

Aroma:  Humongous, gigantic bourbon and sugar cereal notes.

Taste: Cherry, vanilla, caramel candy, apple, maple sugar, and believe it or not, enough hops to notice they were there.

Mouthfeel: Thick, almost goopy, warm.

Overall:  I thought this beer seemed way larger in all respects than last years batch.  I think it is a bit hot and needs some time to get settled.
