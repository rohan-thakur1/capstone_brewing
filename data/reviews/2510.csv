2510,"2015-06-22",3.4,"Can from Craftbros in Seoul. It pours a fairly clear gold and a soapy head of head. The nose is really great with a wonderful fruity hoppiness I enjoy. Med-light bodied with a fairly smooth mouthfeel but it seems somewhat undercarbed. The taste is incredibly bitter with a green pine hoppiness and a mouth-puckering chalky grapefruit rind aftertaste. Too bitter for me and the flavors are not at all in the same vein as the enticing aroma. A bit of a let down but for a 2.7% beer fairly good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

2510,"2015-05-29",2.5,"Can. Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (flowers, apricot), with light notes of cantaloupe and detergent. Flavor is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Light body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Not too bad all things considered, but pretty tough to truly enjoy. Very stark, thin, watery, and with almost not sugars left. So its basically a bitter hop tonic, and the hops are just the usual grapefruit-resin variety so its not a lot of fun to sniff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Almost light medium body with a nice smooth texture. Above normal carbonation with a nice effervescent rush from the middle on.

The outstanding flavor profile is intense in hop flavor, with a degree of complexity and very well balanced - especially for a 2.9% ABV beer. It begins with a blended hop flavor that flows into a mild rind/pine bitterness in the middle. As the edge comes off the bitterness, a mild biscuit sweetness comes forward providing balance. The finish as slightly dry and is a slow fade of rind flavored bitterness.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

The hops in the nose are maybe not quite as vibrant as Id prefer but the bitterness emphasizes the citrus zest hop character once you taste it.

2510,"2014-07-19",3.7,"I poured a 12oz can into a tulip glass. I was canned on 4/29/14 and cost $3.20 ($0.27 per ounce).

Appearance: Glowing shade of white gold. Slightly hazy, but some carbonation is visible. Pours to a two-finger, white, soapy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Light herbal aroma, with hints of seasonings and citrus. Interesting combination.

Taste: Session IPAs are all the rage these days, though I think Evil Twin Bikini Beer was one of the pioneers of the style. What sets it apart is the fact it truly is sessionable at only 2.7% ABV, yet it has the flavor and body of something almost twice its size. Hops play a major role here, from beginning to end in terms of both flavor and bitterness. Up front theres a light citrusy component of lemon or orange peels, with an underlying dry bitterness. I get notes of green tea through the middle, but a strong herbal sensation on the finish. A mixture of basil or pesto or oregano  yet its still quite mild overall. The only bummer is theres not much in the way of true malt distinctiveness, though given the lightweight of the brew thats not surprising. This walks a fine line between what is and is not a novelty beer, as it could go either way for me. 

Drinkability: Simply having a light body does not a session beer make. Evil Twin Bikini Beer is one of the few rare hop-centric session beers thats not ridiculously one dimensional. While the mouthfeel is thin, its consistently carbonated and has absolutely no watery texture or consistency whatsoever. Its refreshing while in the mouth, and would be ideal for warm weather situations.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Evil Twin was, is, and will always be on my Mikkeller List, but I made an exception to explore a highly regarded low alcohol beer as my interest in this territory is particularly high at the moment. Pithy, zest, sun yellow aroma. On the palate, pretty quick biting greenness through Citra-like lime qualities. Fresh and vibrant. At this gravity Im not missing the sugars and am appreciating that this lacks a thin feeling quality, which has instead been replaced with a very pleasing bitterness in the C-hop vein. I do get some light phenols off the yeast and a nip of styrofoam mid-palate, but for something so light, Im rather impressed and Id certainly revisit this in the right situations.

the aromas were lightly toasted malt, a little bread, and maybe a touch of biscuit, the hops were light grass, herb and floral, there was a touch of tropical fruit- orange and lemon with some fruit and malt sweetness, 

it had flavors of herb and faint grass hops, soft toasted malt and some fruit, there was very little to no sweetness in this drink, 
the finish had a gentle bitterness of hops that was drying with little malt flavor, 

it had a pretty light mouth feel and a little creaminess on the tongue, the carbonation was average or so,

A top notch beer proves that not all low alcohol beers have to be tasteless boring water. This is definitely a beer that would be easy to finish at the beach despite the slightly more expensive price tag. Id still love to try Nanny State to see how it stacks up.

Aroma / Appearance - The foamy head surges before it collapses in mere seconds. A transparent rose gold base remains behind. Light grassy hops, orange polish, and gentle malts are easy on the senses but still inviting enough to remind one of a higher gravity IPA.

Flavor / Palate - The watery mouthfeel is expected for a light sessionable beer under 3% ABV. Gentle hops brighten the palate. At $2.99 a bottle it is a bit expensive for a daily drinker but is worth drinking on occasion. Id split it with people new to beer just to show them there is more to life than BMC.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a hazy golden with a medium well retained head and some nice lacing on the glass.
 
The aroma is pretty much just piney and citrusy hops. Some nice lime rind in there, some light limestone. Pretty damned inviting. 
 
The flavor is very hoppy, again with piney and citursy hops, the flavor brings a bit of a dank character and the hops provide a very satisfying level of bitterness. The sweetness level is very low but lingers in the background. Mild iced tea flavors are not unpleasant in the mix. 
 
The beer is thin and a touch watery, but the palate is sharp enough to give the tongue something to cling to...
 
Pretty good stuff. 






 
I was informed by the Evil Twin himself that the bottle I had rated was well over a year old,,, so the notes below are I suppose indicative of a year old bottle of Evil Twin Bikini Beer: 
Pours a hazy golden with a medium well retained head and some nice lacing on the glass.
 
The aroma has some nice fruity hoppiness, some light minerally character, some soap.... its sort of sweet smelling. Not bad, just one of those where you dont quite know what to make of it. One whiff is nice, one is grate, one is unappealing... yknowwhat I mean?
 
The flavor is sort of tea like up front, its got some hop fruitiness, some soapiness, & in general is a little too caramel malt forward for my taste. On the other hand the bitterness is at a really nice satisfying level. 
 
Considering the low cost this must have been one of the US brewed Evil Twin beers & it just hit the shelf... Ive got to assume this was fresh, but alas it did taste a little like an IPA that had spent a little too much time on the shelf.  
That said, it does what loads of crappy-ish IPAs seem to do flavor-wise at twice the ABV of this one, in fact this is better than plenty of IPAs Ive tried @ that strength. So I dont know... I love the idea behind this one, just needs to lift a little harder in the hop brightness department.

How: Tap at Cardinal, Stavanger Norway, sold as Lervig Take It Easy which is aliased on ratebeer as Evil Twin Bikini Beer
The look: Clear golden-blond body topped by persistent small white head
In long: Nose is in-your-face hoppy with a ton of fresh citrusy and floral hops.  A slender body but never watery, which is as much as one can expect from a 2.7% beer.  Basic crackery malts with lots and lots of hops hops, bitter grapefruits and floral aromatic.  Sharp bitterness of medium intensity.  I wouldnt buy a not-so-fresh bottle in North-America, but fresh on tap in Norway this was a really nice low abv beer.  So I bought a pint of this beer at Cardinal and it was called Lervig Take It Easy and now Im entering my rating and I see that it is aliased as Evil Twin Bikini Beer so obviously ehh I dont know what my point is or where I wanted to go with this. if only I had a dollar for each and every time lost my train of thought I dont like country music.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2510,"2012-02-15",3.4,"330ml bottle with 230612 on the cap.  Darker gold, bit of haze, nice off white head that leaves some lacing, and some particles floating around in there.  Bad ass nose!...super pungent with danky tropical fruit hops and light malt underneath although there is a bit of tea in there.  This is a pungent ipa nose and would never guess this is a low alc beer from the smell.  More watery then than I was expecting from the appearance and kind of leaning on the flatter side at first but then has this peppery tight carb finish.  Peppery hop and watery malt flavor up front,  hops are there, but they are like a 95lb 5 chick that looks like she could use a cheeseburger and shake..they just fade so quick and wrap up in a watery steep tea mix of crystal malt and hops.  I kind of nitpicking here a bit since this is a LA beer.  Again, amazing nose and glad to try it, but wouldnt buy again at the price point.  Novelty","Washington, USA","bvc"
