4,"2016-02-15",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2016 500 ml bottle purchased off b3shine - thanks, Beau! 2015 vintage, bottle 71/197. Ive had this on my Wants list since about 2009. So fucken excited to try it, and opened it on the Thursday night my roommates and I got into SF before RBWG 2016 and the first awards shindig. Pours a hazy cocoa brown with a small beige head that turned into a ring. The aroma is good - vanilla, chocolate, oak, brown sugar, bourbon, dark and dried fruits, toasted wheat. But then the flavor comes around and shows obvious infection. It has the elements of the aroma muddled together with sour fruits and a bit of soy. Medium-bodied, with medium carbonation and a tangy, fruity, sweet mouthfeel. Its not a bad beer entirely, but its not what its supposed to be, clearly. Drinks like a dark sour. But man, Im so bummed. Ive wanted this one forever. I need another that isnt infected. RERATE: Prowler from Clownoisseur - thanks again! Pours a hazy chestnut with a tiny khaki ring for a head. Notes of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, oak, leaves, toasted wheat, dates, and just a little bit of boozy heat.

Enjoyed from my Sahm Hamburg goblet (partially alongside my sandwich). Holy moly, this is some thick wax. The minimalist key tool I usually use isnt cutting it. Time to get a knife... 5 minutes and some struggling later... Pours a mildly hazy dark red color, that looks brown overall. Minimal ring of off-white head. Nice whiskey barrel aroma up front in the flavor. Big wood, a bit tannic. Dark fruit, mild vanilla, caramel syrup.. Mild spiciness. Touch of sweet and sour sauce. Little nuttiness, hint of chocolate. It certainly has a complex and interesting flavor. Light to moderate sour taste, moderate-plus sweet, minimal bitter. Some moderate alcohol warmth, kind of like an easier-sipping wine. Mild kinda-spicy bite in the finish. Medium to bigger body. Kind of slick texture. Little to no carbonation. Overall, the mild sourness and lack of carbonation I could do without. But it doesnt spoil the experience entirely. Still a very tasty, one of a kind, unique beer... Though not one I think Id repeat, at the price. Some nice banana comes out later. Pretty tasty stuff overall. Went from 3.6 -> 3.8 through the 2nd half. 8/2/8/3/17 Re-rate, 2/21/16: Pint growler, shared by phaleslu. Kind of brown color. No head. Indeed, its not sour. Nice, like my bottle was before, but without all the sour. Nice nuttyness, chocolate, bit of banana. Toasty. Caramel, nice mild bourbon warmth. Kind of bigger sweet taste, but not slick, more dry in the finish. Nice mild warmth. Medium to bigger body. Kind of slick texture. Very light carbonation. Hides alcohol pretty well. Pretty tasty treat. Nice to try the non-sour, intended version. I didnt mind the soured one, but this is more on-point. Great stuff. Definitely better. Love the chocolatey, nutty character. Delightful.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

The aromas are bold, but not over bearing. Light vanilla, toffee and caramel blend into ripe plum, raisin and fig. Light bourbon and oak follow. The taste is very rich and complex. Hints of oak into sweet vanilla/toffee/fig before some notes ripened dark fruit come into play along with light anise and ginger. The full mouth feel lets the flavors resonate on the palate for a while. A rich grain bill holds this all together nicely before the bourbon barrel character provides a warming finish. Great balance and barrel touch on this vintage.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

Deep reddish brown hue with a nice tan head that sits atop, lasts, and laces plenty. The aroma is pretty amazing with lots of barrel character - vanilla, oak, cream, coconut, a hint of butter - as well as sweet caramel, dark fruits, and more. A very good, though slightly less impressing flavor shows more barrel character, dark fruits, wood, caramel, maltiness, and a touch of bitterness. All in all, this was one heck of a beer and Im glad I got to try it!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
4,"2012-08-18",3.7,"On-tap at The Livery 7th Anniversary. Pours a reddish brown color, large frothy head, thick collar, thick cap. Nose is smooth booze, chocolate, oak, dark fruit, coconut. Taste is oak forward, more booze then the nose, chocolate, dark fruity tartness. Tastes like a more boozy Cuvée de Tomme with less tartness. Full body, good carbonation, tart & booze finish. 

A really interesting beer that is really a hybrid of several styles. Could be called an Old Ale, Wild Ale, or Strong Ale. Not really a Weizen Bock, but who really cares at this point. Its boozy, tart, and oak mixed together and is pretty tasty if enjoyed in smaller portions.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

4,"2011-09-01",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 On tap at the Livery last weekend. Served in a short glass.

Pours a rich dark caramel brown color with a thin off-white head that fades quickly into some bubbles and a thin collar.

Nose is sublime. Even after the pour when the beer was fairly cold there was fantastic complexity. This was only enhanced as it warmed. Overall, the nose was like caramelized bananas and dark fruits that had been soaked in quality bourbon. Really interesting and something Id never thought of, but they really pulled this off well.

Flavor wasnt quite as complex or interesting as the nose. The caramelization and bourbon came through, but the underlying fruits werent quite as apparent.

Medium-full body without much discernible alcohol. Smooth bourbon and just a touch of heat in the finish.

Nose is big, leading with bourbon and vanilla, some clove phenolics are hiding in there as well. Lots of caramel and really quite sweet in the nose. Prunes, raisins & brown sugar as well. Some light yogurt notes that accentuate the prune notes. On taste, its not as robust. The phenolics and booze tend to numb the tongue somewhat and it tends to be on the sweet and spicy side.

 Whisky and oak take this beer all the way home. There was little conception to me as to what the base beers style was, as the cask aging much devoured any style characteristics. That said, this beer held absolutely remarkably, regardless of a base. Vanilla, vinous notes of oak aging, hints of toffee, raisons, dates, figs and brown sugar still shine.

The flavor is really well balanced between the beer and the barrel.  First, heavy thick Weizen Bock with great yeast influence, then the light bourbon, char, and oak emerge on the finish.  Some alcohol flavor, but its minimal, though it does warm the chest noticably.  Mouthfeel is full and thick with minimal carbonation.

I think Brandy would have been a little nicer. Otherwise the flavour has some big caramel malts with some fruit hints. This was really good, but overall it isnt that terribly interesting.

No lacing noted, but the beer leaves thick, full sheet like legs on the glass, foreshadowing what will ultimately be a full, viscous mouthfeel.  The aroma shows intense bourbon notes over an ultra-rich malt base of chocolate, nougat, and faint notes of smoked dark fruits.  The flavor s equally huge, with waves of velvety nougat and dark chocolate blending perfectly with aged bourbon and oak.  The thick, nearly full body is lightly carbonated, which works incredibly well in a big, bourbon barrel aged beer.

Thanks so much, Mike!","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
4,"2007-12-13",3.5,"Bottle at argo0s xmas party--thanks BBB63.  Disclaimer--before you start sending me hate mail--I really dont like bourbon.  As a colleague of mine once said, once you have vomited bourbon from your nose from overindulgence, you really cant stand the smell of it anymore.  That said, pours dark, red edges, small head.  Aroma is, well... bourbon (gag!) and trying to get around that smell I sense a lovely sweet malty balance of nutty malt and coconut.  Flavor is similar--bourbon (gag!) and a decent wheaty malt balance.  Alcohol burn, with aftertaste of bourbon (gag!) and perhaps other dark rum-like flavors.  It is very smooth at least.  Excellent, for people who dont hate bourbon.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","wilkie"
4,"2007-12-09",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2007 Poured from a 22 oz. handbottle.  Dark, reddened oak pour; glassy brandy shading around the edge.  Beautiful and pure aroma of wet oak, eggnog and soft bourbon, pistachio sweetness; stunning.  Toasted coconut and vanilla bean in a spectacular kind of rich tropical heat that is carefully bridled, and simply poignant.  Flavor is thick and full; gooey brown sugars and reduced port; melon sugar, pecan oil, more toasted coconut and a bottomless reservoir of lager yeast fruitiness.  Hint of watermelon, quieted sweet smoke, with plenty of full banana and clove wheatiness toward the finish; this projects quietly up the nose as well.  Lightest wink of heat.  Clean, full, and simply luxurious with soft velvet touch in the mouth; cake batter and rum-like nutty sweetness pulse warmly after swallowing.  Carefully wrought, and brilliant.

4,"2007-10-20",4.5,"10/25/06.  Poured out of 22 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with BBB63 on RateBeer 9/14/06.  Hand-bottled.  Pours an almost still, dark burgundy brown color.  Rough-and-tumble, coarsely-formed beige-tan head that diminishes very quickly.  Aroma is subtly inviting with a densely layered malt-centered array-- brown sugar, dates, bourbon-vanilla, dark caramel, and an outline of cherries.  Its easily a 9-caliber aroma in character, but too damn subtle to rock my face off like a beer of this magnitude ""should.""  I want more.  Thankfully, thats only the beginning.  With a slick, oily, extremely full body, the flavor kicks in firmly, forcefully, and fervently, but with expert refinement all the while.  A smooth wave of deep bourbony vanilla with dark bread and chocolate-clove, the flavor and palate are amazing-- so complex and magically shifting with perfect ""cigar beer"" character.  Fantastic malt extraction through and through, the likes of which Im not sure Ive ever encountered in a beer before.  Id love to learn how they brewed this, because it doesnt feel nearly as hammy with adjunct ""cheats"" like the maple syrup in a World Wide Stout, but my skeptical mind is telling me this cant all be pure brewing wizardry.  One things for sure-- whatever they did, reinheitsgebot this is not.  Really sweeeeeeeeeeet, literally and figuratively.  In the world of extremely-high gravity, experimental beers, this puts even Barley Johns Rosies Ale to (relative) shame.  A masterful, fabulous creation.
9/22/07.  Growler.  Thanks to JohnC via BBB63.  Cherry aroma with a deep, nutty bourbon flavor and rich, dark brown sugar.  Extremely long, extremely delicious finish.  Awesomely drinkable for its heft.  A wonderful monster of a beer.  4.4-4.6.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
4,"2007-10-09",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2008 Notes from Dark Lord Day 07.  Sample from a 7 month old growler--thanks Mike BBB63.  Hazy burnt caramel with a few bubbles for a head--its got legs!  Aroma of bourbon, oak, cherries, smoke, and a bit of maple.  Flavor had lots of ETOH, whiskey, cherries, hints of smoke and tobacco leaves, and a wheaty, spicy alcoholic finish.  Lighter body than Id have thought, considering the strength.  Minimal carbonation.  You need to enjoy bourbon to like this guy.
Notes from GTMW 06.  Aroma of sour cherries, oak, whiskey, wheat (characteristic of a wheat wine), caramel, nuts, and a hint of soy.  Clear mahogany with a couple bubbles of beige for the head.  Flavor is mostly the same with a moderate bittersweet roasty dry finish.  Full body with low carbonation.  Very good.

Dense, boozy aroma: dried dark fruits, some sour-mash character, leather and bourbon; a show of warming alcohol.  Full mouthfeel: intensely generous and chewy; plenty of sour-mash, warming bourbon: toasty vanilla, viscous fruit leather and dried cherries; hints of a floral character; some grainy wheat coming through as well, adding another layer to the mouthfeel; even with a little loss of carbonation this is gorgeous.

4,"2007-08-31",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2013 Dark burgundy burnt amber colored body, surprisingly dark, but then again I really didnt know what to expect with this beer I guess I thought it would resemble a weizen bock, dark muddy brown, but instead it looked deep dark brown, like motor oil, with some red and golden brown hues around the sides of the glass.  Very little head when poured from the hand-bottle, but a layer of small bubbles were slowly drifting up towards the top.  Nose is of extremely rich bourbon and some hot, vodka-like grain alcohol, along with bourbon-soaked chocolate, rich and lightly sweet amaretto.  Flavor is smoky, resinous, charred bourbon, with some and resinous woody burnt toffee, and abundant chocolate malts, and perhaps even a little bit of soy and tar tasted as well.  Again, its viscous and heavy, and has a bit of a burn on the back of the mouth and throat, finishing with a caramel, bourbon and heavy, tarry bourbon flavor.

Taste is amazing - bourbon, oak, and heavy brown sugar dominate with vanilla, rich dark fruits, and other assorted, woody flavors mixed in.  Mouthfeel is incredible - tingly, smooth, wonderful.  Paralyzingly good.  So well done, I dont know what to make of it.  I could drink this beer all the damn time.

Other flavors showing through the bourbon included vanilla, alcohol, and some sweet roasted malt notes.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied with almost no carbonation to speak of.

4,"2007-07-29",4.2,"On tap at the brewpub.  Dark dark brown with a lack of head.  The stillness is complete.  Big bourbon nose.  Mostly vanilla and alcohol.

Not watery, though far from syrupy thick.  Big bourbon flavor.  Vanilla sweetness.  A little buttery, mostly whiskey vanilla w some slight roast and wheaty esters.  A bit of diacetyl, but this is fitting of the beer, filling out the profile and cutting the alcohol.  Long fruit to bourbony oak finish.

The flavor found toasted nutty notes, fruits, and chrries at the core, with sour oak and cherry vinegar around.. vanilla out there too.. complex, but the heavy sourness was offputting for me.

The clear star of the day, I must have had five samples of this.  If it had
   not distracted me I may have gotten more rates in but it was well worth it.
   If only I could have this tapped directly into my fridge I would probably
   never leave the house again.  I hope it makes an appearance next year as well
   if only so that I can get one more taste.
Aroma / Appearance - Roasted coffee, bourbon, vanilla, cherry, maple
   syrup, toffee and molasses round out a nose that I could have spent hours
   smelling.  There was so much going on I am certain I am not doing it justice
   with that description.  The body was like molasses both in color and texture.
   It did not so much swirl around the glass as glide.  The lacing was huge and
   sticky as befits a high ABV beer.
Flavor / Palate - Theres no possible way this can be 18% by volume.
   It has no burn at all.  Instead it simply goes down smoothly, almost like a
   port or sherry.  Hints of cherry pie with sugar on the crust begin a wonderful
   medley of flavors.  Next comes wheat, bourbon, vanilla and a whole slew of
   sweet fruitiness.  I could definitely drink this one all night until it caught
   up to me without realizing how potent it was.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4,"2006-08-14",4.3,"Probaly the 2nd most potent brew at the Great Taste. Again the aroma so rich and full that it is hard to initiate a sip. Everyone gives you the ""Whoa"" when they take that first sniff. The alcohol is really flying out of there at first but then the vanilla, maple,carmel,gently massage your senses and your no longer afraid. The taste is much the same,with boubon coming through and some of the wheat becoming noticable. The swallow is long and dreamy,with an exqusite aftertaste lingering in your mouth. There should be a man-law that this brew be available to the Midwest year round","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
4,"2006-04-14",3.8,"Rich brassy is devoid of head, but clings to the glass beautifully. Very clean woody tannins waft up from the glass along with alcohol, plums, bread pudding, aged/cakey malt, and caramel. Light oxidation and pineapple. Oaky tannins sting the palate right away and ignite a drying surge of alcohol. Soft, powdery malts soon cushion the zippy tannins. Toffee lies sandwiched between all the bourbon, although the bourbon never becomes forcefully sweet or husky. Candied peaches and slick plum esters complement the predominantly firm oaky backbone. Slight huskiness develops late, before finishing with rounded peachy acidity, soft and tangy wheat, and a lasting tannic onslaught. Could use a bit more composure in the aroma, but the bourbon is clean instead of corny and husky. In terms of flavor, the alcohol is not easily recognized, but the base beer needs more sturdiness to withstand the bourbon influence. Nicely done. Thanks, BBB63.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4,"2006-03-10",4.3,"The aroma is very striking. I thought first of caramelized sugar, like a snickerdoodle cookie (no cinnamon) that just came out of the oven. So tantalizing that you take a bite even though you know youll burn your mouth.Also a bit of bourbon in the flavor but this comes across with tons of toasted pecan which makes the overall effect very round and full. The concoction is somehow dusted with powdered sugar and inoculated with the right amout of alcohol. A true ruby hue is noticed. Carbonation confuses itself with alcoholic burn and the two get intertwined.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
4,"2006-03-04",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2007 That very special handbottle from Steve and enjoyed with TAR and CB, served in Expedition and Stone IRS snifters: Mahogany hued with an very heavy oily cling to the glassware.  The nose is an intense deep infusion of aromas and esters including: vanilla bean, prune, candy apple, licorice, juniper, bacon, sea salt, caramel, wheat and rye breads.  So powerful, I had to walk away for a second to regain thought, didnt help I it caused me to go a sneezing spree for about 2 minutes. That is one powerful aroma!  The flavor has a wonderful interplay of smokey wood, caramel and mocha, ripened fruits, with noticeable but not overpower alcohol. There is a rich clove and cardamom like spice near the vinous end. It also has a salty (also barleywine-ish ) bite on the finish. The mouth texture is oily and lush with a biting warming sensation, a true evening sipper. I think it is indeed worthy of its past ratings, a true powerhouse beer. Just enough barrel ageing you know for sure it is there but never did it overplay its hand. You would be hard pressed to find a better beer in the lager family. (hope the next release in August is near it equal) MANY MANY THANKS to Steve for letting me share the last drops of this batch!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
4,"2005-10-04",4.2,"Tap @ Great taste of the Midwest- My favorite beer of the fest for me. Pours a dark mahogany brown color, small cola colored head. Aroma is musty, lots of wood, vanilla, caramel, butterscotch. Woody but not overpowering, the alcohol is almost undetectable. WOW!","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
4,"2005-09-11",4.2,"On tap at the 2005 Great Taste of the Midwest:  Pours a deep mahogany brown with a thin, light tan head.  Sweet brown sugar, raisins and nice malty caramel and dark chocolate notes permeate the aroma.  Body starts very rich, malty and sweet with a bittersweet, semi-dry and warming finish.  Hides its alcohol fairly well given the amount of it.  An interesting and complex brew.  Good to see a new brewery coming out with stuff like this.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4,"2005-08-21",4.0,"05 GTMW sample.  Clear brown body.  Chocolate, grape, and crackers in the aroma.  Rich stewed peach, dark malt flavor.  Stemmy hops with milk chocolate sweetnes.  Pepper and milk chocolate in the finish.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
4,"2005-08-14",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2006 On tap at the Great Taste of the Midwest, Madison, 8/13/2005. After trying this, I thought to myself, ""This is as good as beer can possibly be."" Among the Bourbon barrel beers I tried that day or sampled earlier, this was the finest. All the great notes of American oak, apple cider spices, vanilla and caramel on the nose harmonize beautifully on the palate. Im not sure if it was the lager aspect of this, but it was incredibly smooth to drink. All in all, my favorite beer of the festival, and thats saying a lot! (And not that this figures into the ratings in anyway, but the brewer was a great guy. He said he hopes to start bottling this in 750 ml.This is easily up to top50 standards.) ****UPDATE FoBAB at GI. My only perfect 5. Amazing.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
4,"2005-08-14",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2006 Sampled on tap at GTMW.  This one pours to a hazy dark brown body with a tan head and excellent lacing.  The aroma is oak bourbon with a nutty malty backbone.  Oak barrels and bourbon abound in the flavor.  The palate surprisingly covers up the 16%.  Very creamy.  TRY IT!

retried at GTMW 2006.  Even better.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4,"2005-08-14",4.8,"Tap @ GTMW.  My God, what a way for a new brewery to introduce itself.  Hands down the best of show.  Mostly opaque with ruby chestnut accents at the edges when held to light.  One of the best bourbon laden aromas yet.  Some rye and pumpernickel, caramel, vanilla, roasted elements and cedar.  Man, what a quaff.  Bourbon begins by taking a modest bow, interceded with chocolate and caramel trait assertions, reminding you of its bock roots.  A light biscuit yeast characteristic and banana nodes silently grace across the palate and principally draw out some vanilla, perfectly balanced from its combination from the bourbon barrel and hefe yeast strain.  My God this is good.  Pervasive chocolate complimented by cedar casings and a forest woodiness gently toy with my emotions, and an undeniably top shelf bourbon remains in the finish.  Top notch in every way.  Absolutely admirable.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4,"2005-08-14",4.7,"On tap at GTMW.  Aroma is complex.  I think Ill just list off some adjectives: woody, buttery, caramel, roasty, and nutty wheat.  I listed the wood first, but it doesnt overpower the other flavors.  Dark mahogany brown with a tan head...very pretty.  Great buttery bourbon and wood flavor at first but then strong roasted caramel with a wheat twan and a hint of chocolate.  The chocolate grows as you drink.  Every drink makes this stuff more tasty, they were very generous with the pour.  Alcohol is barely noticable.  Good medium mouthfeel, Very drinkable.  Wow. Thanks for bringing this one.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
