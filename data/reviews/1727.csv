1727,"2017-03-11",4.3,"Furth has a very thick, white head, a hazy, bubbly, lemon-yellow appearance, which clouds up, following the ""swish & pour"", and a bit of lacing left behind. The aroma is of spiced white bread, a shade of citrus, and some Hubble Bubble. Taste is of those elements, with negligible bitterness. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Furth finishes sort of wet/chewy.

1727,"2016-09-13",3.6,"Can (473 ml), shared by JulienHuxley, thanks! Pale yellow-golden with a medium white head, moderate retention, leaving little lacing. Aroma is fun because while theres bananas, spices (cloves mostly) and oranges notes as expected its all well dosed and, like Julien said, the cereals breadiness is still present. Taste is grains forward with banana, mild spiciness, gentle wheat acidity and mild herbalness. Light to medium body. Good carbonation. Fruity and mildly spicy finish. Good take on an Hefeweizen. Easy drinking and quenching because its rather light and its super well balanced.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

1727,"2016-04-01",3.2,"Single can from Julios. Pours out a hazy light orange. Little to no head. The aroma is right. Banana and clove but the body and texture leaves a lot to be desired. The classic German Hefeweizen is one style that has a very tight definition of perfection that shouldnt be messed with. Otherwise - please put this into the generic ""Wheat Ale"" category.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
1727,"2016-02-07",3.7,"Draft at the brewery. Pours hazy yellow-gold with a creamy white head. The nose has some dry wheat, phenol, lemon peel, banana. Medium sweet with loads of semi-ripe banana, doughy wheat bread. Light to medium bodied with lively, massaging carbonation.

1727,"2015-09-24",3.4,"Tap at Nightshift, at 5.8%. It pours hazy golden - orange with a decent white head. The nose is soft, sweet, dough, sweet banana, clove, candy and a hint of lilt.

1727,"2015-09-07",3.7,"Interesting take on a hefe. Nice hazy pale golden with white head. Aroma is banana, melon, light spice. Taste is nice and flavorful with mild sweetness. Hopped a bit much for the style but a nice creamy mouthfeel keeps it interesting. I dig this.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1727,"2015-07-18",3.9,"Draft at Night Shift. Perfect bright golden yellow with lasting pillowly head retention. Great yeast phenols on the nose; bananas, melons and some cloves. Great nose. 
Subtle wheat sweetness that is medium in body with a lingering banana finish. The lower carbonation really allows the banana and wheat notes to shine. Higher ABV then most in the style and I had no idea until I read the beer menu. Almost a creamy texture, smoothness. Overall, quite good and a real nice example of the style.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
1727,"2015-07-15",3.7,"Taster at the source. Pours pale orange straw with a white head. Aroma is honey, graham cracker, banana. Flavor is pretty straight up hefeweizen, honey, banana, clove. Dries just a bit toward the finish. Well crafted.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
1727,"2015-07-09",3.7,"Draught at the brewery, 7/8/15Lightly cloudy goldenrod with a medium-sized white head that shows moderate retention.Good blend of spicy phenols which seem to vastly outdo the banana and bubble gum, which seems great. Honey, humidity-moistened graham crackers and light caramel corn maltiness definitely announces itself in the aroma, rounding out the spiciness and masking any alcohol. Dosent seem particularly ""Imperial"" from the nose.The flavor seems pretty on par for a German hefe with, again, mostly spicy phenols and rich maltiness. More viscous, I suppose, than your typical hefe, but not boozey or overly sweet/sugary. Enjoyable and very drinkable, but its a little unsettling that a 7.1% hefe drinks like a 5% one. I guess if Im going to expose myself to more alcohol, Id want a lot more complexity. Regardless, the soft, viscous texture and lively carbonation are enjoyable and there is no alcohol or flaw.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
