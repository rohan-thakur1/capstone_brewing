2537,"2014-05-30",2.9,"First venture into low ABV beers. This was a pleasant surprise. The lower markings can be attributed to its innate introversion. Low ABV (LAB) beers arent going to assault the palate or provide seminal flavors. What this does do, is assuage the fear that LABs are thin-bodied and bereft of discernible flavors. The body here is light but enhanced by jubilant carbonation. It has beautiful balance in both the nose and taste between caramel and light citrus/earthy hop flavor. I would prefer the earthy, spicy notes were reigned in but thats personal preference. 
The best sub-3 beer I have had.","Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","jerd16"
