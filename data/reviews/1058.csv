1058,"2016-01-15",3.9,"bottle. Very pale straw, almost colorless with small head. The sweetness of the perry with the dry and tart red wine notes are a fantastic combination. The pear comes through well, but the combination yields some berry notes as well. faint oak. I could drink a ton of this.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"

1058,"2015-11-28",3.6,"Cool unique cider - never had a blend of pear and red wine, and it works pretty well. Crisp pear and berries and oak on the nose and palate. Body is light, but thats ok.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1058,"2015-11-01",3.5,"Pours clear, light gold into a shaker. No head. Pear and oak aromas. Sweet pear and red wine upfront turns to oak in the dry, lasting finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"

1058,"2015-06-26",3.3,"Bottle at PIB 2015, pours a cloudy blonde with an orange tinge and a s white head. Aroma brings out subtle red wine barrels and a touch of dry apple skins. Flavour brings out vanilla, candied sugar, and apples. Not really pronounced on the red wine, but its pretty well-balanced. Solid.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

1058,"2015-06-16",3.2,"i enjoy Crispin products, they do do perrys quite well, but i must say the base got very lost in red wine barrel on this one .. pours a murky ruby amber .. light as can be foam .. red wine, red apple, and hard red skin with barrel .. mild tannins .. mouth is airy with a bit of booze .. while i can see what went into this, not really that enjoyable .. . . baby with an eyepatch. hours of entertainment!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"

1058,"2015-06-16",4.4,"Enjoyed a bottle of this last night. Very interesting pear cider right here and perhaps one of the best Ive had. Aroma was pear, red wine, honey, straw, flowers, grass, herbs. Taste was amazing, the pear is subdued and yet lingers the longest, the wine has a drying effect and also a heavy bitterness to it, the herbs and the floral taste flutter around briefly. The appearance is a hazy cloudy sparkling orange. Truly wonderful.","Oakland, California, USA","ffbot"
1058,"2015-05-25",3.8,"Really lovely cider from a maker that has had some hits and had some misses. The aroma is the best part of this: rich, aromatic, promising sour, funk, and woody notes. The appearance is fine, esp. the haziness (and a few chunks near the end) but it was an unremarkable color. The flavor gives up a bit of that honey sweetness but largely keeps to the simplicity of the pears with the wine notes. Really drinkable and enjoyable. Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1058,"2015-05-20",3.7,"Pours dull golden with a light pink tint and very little head. The aroma has rich apple and pear with some caramelization, mild sourness, some red wine notes and a creaminess that seems malty. Very nice. It has a medium smooth velvety body with only a small amount of carbonation. The flavor starts off with rich pear, some alcohol, hints of oak and wine as well as a spicy tartness. The finish is a bit more sour with some more of the red wine coming through, but the pear aspects stay in the front. Very enjoyable perry.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1058,"2015-05-20",3.9,"Bomber. Poured cloudy medium golden with little head. The aroma picked up sweet pears, white wine, and oak.. rich and enticing. The flavor found a great blend of sweet and tart pears, with great accents from barrel and wine.. white grapes and tart pear on the finish.. Good spices too. Medium-bodied with low carbonation.. tart and refreshing.. great stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1058,"2015-05-19",3.4,"Sample at Hopfest 2015. Comes a cloudy gold with just the trace of a white head. Aroma of fruit and wood. Taste is pears, dark fruit, red wine, and oak. Nice.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
1058,"2015-05-17",3.4,"(bottle - 22 oz) Slightly cloudy gold pour with a light head. Light pear and definite dark fruit aroma with hints of oak. Flavor has a bit of pear but mainly a lot of red wine and wood notes. Dry finish with a wine-like hint at the finish.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
1058,"2015-04-15",3.8,"Red wine, blackberry, pear. Milky golden. Pear, apple, must, sawdust. Light body, spritzy, only slighly warm. Well balanced. Really excellent.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
1058,"2015-04-12",3.7,"Bomber from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours hazy light gold with a transient white smear. Aroma of perry with light notes of red grape and wood. Near med body. Flavor is pear and wood, honey on the lips, and the grape is pretty low key. But I think its there. So much wood the pear is almost submerged, but it comes back with each quaff.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
