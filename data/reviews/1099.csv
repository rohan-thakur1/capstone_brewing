1099,"2014-03-14",3.7,"500ml bottle, 2010 vintage. Pours an attractive clear, deep gold. Mildly tannic skin notes, vanilla and pear juice make up the aroma. Tart pear skin and a slight leathery flavour up front lead into subtle, slightly sweet pear fruit in the mid-palate. A slight lemon flavour gives it a nice, crisp finish. I dont know why this rates so poorly; it is a very good example of proper, English medium-dry perry. Very enjoyable.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
