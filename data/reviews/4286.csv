4286,"2016-11-26",3.8,"Bottle. Malty nose, with rich and concentrated stone fruit, some grass, and a little citrus. Bright gold/amber color, with slight chill haze. Moderately sweet malt, strong stone fruitiness, caramel, bread. The mid palate bitterness saves it from becoming cloying. Finish is a bit sweet, but overall its balanced. Medium body. Great malty stuff. A bit heavy and full-flavored for the style.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
4286,"2016-09-03",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2016 330ml bottle bought at LY Drinks & Bitess booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during HKTDC Food Expo 2016.
Looks: Clear golden orange colour; One quarter finger head with residual soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and intense full Lager malt, with strong sulphur, light metallic, strong lemon flesh and peels, tangerines, pepper, floral, molasses, bread and quite sharp grass. Wow! 

Taste: Medium to strong nice sweet full Lager malt, with strong orange, lemon, floral, molasses, light bread, medium bitter hops and grass. 

Body: Close to medium body. Slick and smooth palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong lager maltyness in a lean but solid background. Pretty silky with every sip. The malt has that nice orangey taste which is a lot more natural and tastier than those by Suntorys Premium Malt series. Lively lemon and grassy hop profile thanks to Burtonization (that sulphur aroma!). Sweetness is strong but very nice and tasty. The 6% booze is invisible. Excellent!

Hoppiness: Strong lemon flesh and peels, pepper, floral and grass in nose. Lemon, floral, and grass in taste; Bitterness is moderate for a lasting, mid to light astringent sweet malty finish. 

After Taste: Fairly dry. Citrusy, sweet and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: As a Dortmunder, this one is a very close to the style, with unmistakable Burtonized sulphur aroma and strong lemony hop taste, well attenuated with chop-licking orangey malty character, topped with clean hoppiness. Very enjoyable!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
4286,"2016-06-23",3.7,"Bottle. Strong clear gold colour with a nice big foamy head, lots of bubbles. Rich bready malt aroma, some fruity notes, grassy hops. Lovely malt flavour with a slightly sweet caramel edge, hints of grape and citrus giving a little tang at the end. Good body, nice bitter middle and a clean finish. Very refreshing, satisfying dortmunder.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"

4286,"2015-06-27",3.6,"Bottle from Tanakaya. Poured into a tulip pint. Clear gold with a nice pillowy white head that leaves a nice rim around the edge throughout. Biscuity aromas present with some grain, grass and lemon along with some fruity esters. Medium to full body flavor with average carbonation. Malt really sticks out and is nice. A nice touch of sweetness, but not cloying at all. Very enjoyable.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
4286,"2014-05-07",3.4,"Draught at Bungalow. Clear gold with big white head and decent lacing. Aroma has hops, some grass and a bit of biscuit. Very smooth, bitter hop start and biscuity finish. Very drinkable. Doesnt taste like 6%.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
4286,"2013-11-18",3.5,"6% bottle from the 3900 Rakuten set. A clear deep yellow pour with a thick foamy head that leaves behind good lacing. The aroma is a mix of grassy & fruity with possibly a touch of lemon. The taste is full bodied, sweet biscuity malts with a dry finish which reminds me of white wine. Sweet but not cloying, the malt profile really shines through, solid.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
4286,"2013-06-14",3.7,"Bottle at home. Clear golden colour with small white head. Aroma is grassy hops, bit grainy and something else too. Maybe a touch of lemon and a bit peppery. Taste is pretty nice. Initial hoppy bitterness and finish is a bit more fruity and sweet malty. This was very easy to drink, I raced through it. I am starting to enjoy these kind of beers more recently.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"

4286,"2012-12-29",3.3,"Bottle at a local Japanese restaurant. Deep gold with a quickly dissipating white head. Bready with apricot and a little orange, pepper. Round, rich but modestly sweet again with some fruit in with bread. Bitterness and spices creep up from just balancing to a bit more. Not bad, probably could have been fresher.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
4286,"2009-10-04",3.6,"Appearance: Transparent gold.
Aroma: Fruity--apricot and peach.
Flavor: Apricot, peach malt with discreet bittering that seem to accent the fruit.  The fruity malt gradually turns to a lightly burnt, bitter finish.
Comment: Medium bodied on Draft. A very well-made lager with  fine malt/hop balance. It has just enough carbonation for the mouthfeel to be smooth with just enough liveliness to complement the bittering hops.  An ale-like lager.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"
4286,"2009-05-20",3.5,"Draught at Craft Beer Bar, Yokohama.  Clear deep golden, rich firm head. Sweaty hops shine in a fruity nose. Outspokenly dry with clean, yet deep mouthfeel. Grassy hops xover the well developed malt. Fruity wih baanced salty bitterness. Pleasant and quaffable.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
4286,"2009-05-17",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2015 A very good mild beer. Not a big nose, but lots of body in here. Had a mild taste of honeywith a soft hoppy finish. Better than expected.","JAPAN","jonno"
4286,"2008-09-01",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2008 On tap at Wachi.
Dark golden color with a  tall, very fine head. Sweet, full malt aroma, with caramel, lots of  fruit and good hops. Super rich, extremely fruity flavor, caramel, butter, and bubble gum as well. Round and mellow, but with good hopping. Round malt finish with lots of hops, though not overly bitter. Very good balance. Very full flavored, hoppy Dortmunder style lager. A few tenths higher than in the bottle (3.7)","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"

4286,"2006-12-29",3.0,"Yellow-golden color with a slight haze... quickly disappearing white head.  Aroma of malts, some hops, maybe a slight floral character, and some sugary sweetness.  Fairly strong malty and hoppy flavors, with some sweet grainy elements.  A substantial mouthfeel and a dry finish.  Pretty good stuff.","San Diego, California, USA","DarkMagus"
4286,"2006-02-12",3.5,"Bottle.  Pale, slightly hazy, ugly head, and theres this wispy thing sort of hanging in the beer that trails from the top.  No shit, it isnt a mark on the other side of the glass or anything, it has about the same density as the beer as you jiggle it and all.  Ive never seen this in a beer.  Firm mouthfeel and ""husky"" body, to take from Oakess rating.  Richly grainy, a pretty good representation of the style.  Some honey in the aroma makes it interesting.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
4286,"2005-09-11",3.9,"Lovely rich, teak brown complexion, with thin, creamy head. Vivid, comely fragrance with honey, floral traits. Sweet on the front palate. Has a treacle feel on the back with vague hop presence. Full on balanced malt injection. Delightful.","Shinjuku, Tokyo, JAPAN","yeeeeeeeees"
4286,"2005-05-21",3.0,"Dark straw colour.  Low visible carbonation and no head.  Bready malt aroma - slightly honeyish, slightly cidery.  Flavour is sweetish with a slight huskiness and a further hint of cider.  Wet body.  Finish is the cleanest these pale malts have been all beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4286,"2005-04-16",3.4,"A golden color with a frothy head.  A full malty body, low hops. A mildly sweet bready malty finish with just touch of hops.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
4286,"2004-04-20",2.6,"This is a ""Dortmunder export type Lager"". A clear gold with a medium white foamy head. Some lacing present.  A mild sweet, grassy aroma, balanced with light floral hopping.  A somewhat sweet taste with just a touch of alcohol noticeable. Very mild and easy to drink. Look like it would be more carbonated than what it is. My #1 complaint on this company is that the damned bottle caps are on so tight, they must have a pneumatic capper cranked all the way up!","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
