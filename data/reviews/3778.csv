3778,"2011-08-17",3.5,"Bottle:  The aroma consists of moderate bubblegum, light banana, grain, and a hint of alcohol.  It pours a mostly transparent amber with just a touch of haze.  It has a small off-white head that fades to a thick ring around the edges of the glass after a minute or so and leaves spotty lacing behind.  The flavor starts with a quick dose of banana.  The finish has some graininess, light bubblegum, alcohol, and a touch of clove.  Medium bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat thin mouthfeel.  Overall, an okay Weizen Bock that tastes stronger than 8.5%.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3778,"2011-06-16",3.0,"In short: A spicy sweet bubblegum in a bottle.  Meh. How: Bottle 12oz.  2010 vintage (8%).  Consumed when probably about 6 to 8 months of age.  Bottle sent to me by oakbluff, thanks Scott The look: Almost clear orange-blonde body topped by a small persistent white head In long: Nose has a lot of yeasty fruity esters (bananas & peaches mainly) but also annoying acetone.  Taste has banana bread, cloves, hospital gloves, bubble gum, Sainte-Catherine taffy, nutmeg, honey, some maple.  Did not feel very sweet although Im sure it is.  This truly was more a strange liquefied candy than anything else.  Not bad, not good.  I seem to like this beer less than most people here but I stand by my opinion because I am someone with as much self-confidence as I am totally awesome.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The aroma was a little grain, light tartness, orange and citrus, a bit of syrupy sweetness, banana hints, and some spice as clove and vanilla. Ditto on the flavor, with some alcohol warmth, moderate hop bitterness, lively carbonation, and a light creaminess to the mouthfeel. Medium+ bodied, and very enjoyable, Kirby!","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

Taste is banana, bready yeasty takes over in the middle with some slight spice notes, then the yeast kicks in with a touch of sweet toffee and dark fruit at the end.

3778,"2011-03-14",3.7,"Compared it side-by-side with Aventinus and it was no-contest, this one was inferior. It was lighter in both color and taste and it didnt have a huge head that stuck forever like the Aventinus.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3778,"2011-03-06",4.0,"12oz Bottle. Thanks Kevin! Seems paleish for a Weizen Dopelbock (does that make it a Weizenbock?), but with a big banana nose, lots of ripe fruit and juiciness. Flavors are complex and hold a bevy of tartness, lemon, clove, banana, citrus, wheat-oils and light fruits. This feels more like a beefed up Hefe, which is how they describe, than a Doppelbock with wheat or a Weizenbock (not enough darker malts). Its a touch confusing, but well done. Drinkable for its heft and above average in complexity.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3778,"2011-03-06",3.8,"12oz, 2010 bottle. Pours a cloudy, orange-gold colored body with a finger-width, dense and foamy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is rich banana bread, sweet nuts, yeast, bubble gum, some honey-wheat, a light clove, some caramel, and a touch of earthy spice. Flavor is quite nice and not as sweet as I anticipated it being (which is a good thing). Lots of banana bread, but not as dominant as the aroma. A good amount of clove and spice to balance the malty sweetness. Yeast, caramel, bubble gum, wheat, and a touch of honey. Finishes with a nice clove, soft spice that balances the sweetness and gives this a light bitterness. Just a hint of alcohol warmth before leaving a lengthy aftertaste following a medium-full, very smooth body and soft, moderately lively carbonation. Overall, a really nice beer. It definitely has a big banana bread sweetness, but it never becomes cloyingly sweet and remains extremely well balanced with the spices and yeasty element. This could easily have gotten sloppy and out of hand, but they did a really nice job keeping this together. Solid.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Aroma of banana candy, bubblegum, light spices, yeast, nuts and more. Flavour of yeast, wheat, banana, light spices and a light bitter finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Light to average bodied. This is not exactly to my taste but thats not the beers fault, its very well made.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"

3778,"2010-12-15",3.5,"(bottle)  Pours gold/light orange with a large off-white head that settles quickly to a thin cap.  Aroma of very ripe, brown-speckled skinned banana, wheat, bubblegum, and alcohol thats paired with a musty undertone which I found to detract from the overall aroma.  Flavor is fairly similar, but theres plenty of caramel and banana in here, which gives a bananas foster-esque flavor.  Chalky and lightly tart wheat in the finish serves to diminish the sweetness and provides a refreshing quality, but the transition between the flavors is somewhat clumsy.  Lingering dryness.  Mouthfeel is rather light with a medium level of carbonation.  This is a decent weizenbock, but not one Id actively seek to drink again.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

3778,"2010-10-16",3.8,"2010 Bottle: Pours a rich golden, a little cloudy - whitish head with decent retention. Aroma was for a second Aventinus. Clearly not - but interesting. It has those distinct bavarian weizen elements ; clove, spice, citrus, bananas, with a sort of sweet brown sugar near the tail end, coupled with a touch of booziness. Ah, and theres that banana again as well - Carbonation is a bit lively here  - Im very pleasantly surprised with this brew - for sure.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

3778,"2010-09-22",3.6,"2010 Bottle.  Pours a caramel orange with a nice dense fine frothy white head.  Aroma is huge banana, can smell it immediately upon pouring, a nice rich bananas foster though, caramelized brown sugar.  Flavor follows but isnt overwhelmingly sweet like it could have been, just a light bit of burnt rubber phenol towards the finish, bit too much alcohol towards the finish though also, light bitterness also in the finish.  Fairly well attenuated, not syrupy, finer fizzy carbonation.  A very nicely made beer, perhaps the aroma is the best part.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

3778,"2010-07-29",2.7,"This tastes to me pretty much like a hefeweizen but w/ more malt character and a bit of alcohol burn. It pours w/ a nice white head that makes up somewhat for its otherwise unappealing muddy orange color. The nose is bananas and clove, a bit of tartness and some caramel in the background. Flavor is comparatively thin and the texture manages to be a bit watery despite a bit of sticky toffee sweetness. It is a major issue w/ me that big beers have enough flavor to justify their bigness. This tastes good but it would taste just as good at five or six percent alcohol as it does at eight","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
3778,"2010-07-06",3.8,"Light orange/amber in color.  Aroma bananas, clove, spices, apricot, and carmelized malt.  Wheat aspects are recognizable in the taste first followed by carmel malt and some fruitiness.  Acidic finish.  Medium-full body.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"

The aroma picked up very sweet banana and vanilla notes upfront with white pepper and clovey accents.. warm and strong, but inviting.  The flavor found more vanilla and banana sweetness at the core.. black pepper and clovey spicage plus wheaty sourness around.. a little too much residual sugar in the end.  Sweet overall on the palate, which managed to hold the alcohol warmth in check.. filling and tasty.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3778,"2010-06-13",3.4,"On tap at the brewery - Really excited that this came out of retirement, but honestly I found myself liking the dialed-down, regular old weizen better. Still, a lot to like about this one. Pours really hazy brown with a small off-white head. Smells pretty smooth, with clove and cinnamon, banana, and some sticky sweetness. Lots of tropical fruit in this one, with flavors of mango and banana, sweet wheat, light clove, and a touch of heat. Pretty full and sticky, which along with the sweetness makes it a bit cloying. Not bad, but the refreshing, clean fruitiness of the regular weizen was much better.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

Good play on the palate, nice and chewy, though this wears away.
Very smooth, very mellow. Flavor is complex, in that contains things I cannot entirely comrehend, yet one-dimensional, in that it offer up little else throughout the drink. A sweet, candyish citric taste is predominant. A little plastic-feeling.
Not a bad drink, quite enjoyable, and unigue. But compares poorly against the hallmark of the style, Aventinus. What doesnt?","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

A moderate body that might be a bit on the thin side.  I didn't get much of the Weizen elements, but it was still a tasty beer.  Nice malty, fruity body with a crisp hop kick at the end.

3778,"2003-06-24",4.3,"Hazy, cloudy dark gold with a peachy tone in color, thin white head of tight foam, faded fast, leaves some stringy lace. Smell is faintly sweet, a bit of wheat, lemon, orange, and peach with a light touch of spice. Taste is great of lemon and orange and incredibly thick and chewy, excellent sweet tartness and citrusy sourness, solid sweet wheat, but all mellowed down and easy to handle. Feel is pretty full and has a very nice creamy smoothness with a slight tart hold in the middle and then has this strange little sourness left on the lips like I had just bit into a orange with the peel still on.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
3778,"2003-01-18",4.2,"Sampled a vintage 2001 bottle.  Malty clean aroma with a clear golden color.  Muted weizen character with a small amount of wheat grainyness.  Well balanced and malty.  Alcohol not detected.  Big creamy mouth feel.  This beer has aged well and it a pleasure to drink.  One of the better Capital Brewery beers.  A defenite must try if you like big German style lagers.","Ames, Iowa, USA","ekarmst"
3778,"2002-12-22",2.8,"Rerating here, not nearly as good as I remember.  Some wheat, a bit of sour clove and alcohol (with a tinge of solvent) in the aroma.  Aroma is actually a bit harsh and forboding.  Malt flavor starts out good with a nice sticky wheatiness, but itis quickly hijacked by a sour component that prevents any enjoyment of a lingering malt flavor.  There is a bit of the long finish there that is good, but it always finishes off a little sour.  ALmost devoid of carbonation.  Im not going to resample this any time soon.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
3778,"2002-10-16",4.1,"The aroma of this beer is strikingly similar to a Belgian Strong Ale, with a heavy scent of alcohol present.  The flavor is a combination of a Belgian Ale and Bavarian wheat.  Not exactly what was expected, but very tasty.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","scrawfis"
3778,"2002-09-21",4.2,"Pours with an attractice creamy froth white foam.  The aroma brings to mind pineapples and caramel, yeasty fruitiness, peach, dough, and alcohol.  Like alcohol soaked fruit.  Very smooth and soft palate leads you to believe this will be easy to slam.  However, the rich flavors of sweet bread, caramel, cocoa, and fruity Belgian yeast notes force you savor each ounce.  This is also turning slightly acidic.  The soft finish provides lingering Munich malt, peach, brown sugar, subtle banana, and notable traces of alcohol.  A nice rendition of this rare style.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3778,"2002-09-07",4.2,"This one was also great.  I love this brewery more with every beer.  Beautiful thick head with an almost candy like aroma.  The flavor was on par with any of the other weizen doppelbock i have had.  highly recommend.","California, USA","Beloved Beer"
3778,"2002-08-12",3.5,"Light amber color with a smallish light tan head.  Aromas of yeast, sour apples and honey.  Slight metallic and medicinal flavors.  The smae flavors I get in my homebrew when I dont get a good attenuation.  Finishes sweeter and spicier.  Decent effort on a tough style.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3778,"2002-07-27",4.1,"Lighter colored, compared to Aventinus, and not at all cloudy, even after pouring the sediment...?  Very grapey, hints of pear and honey, also floral notes (lilac, esoteric, no?)  Quite sweet, but the light hopping, spice, and dry alcohol bite pull this from the edge of being cloying.  The finish reminds me of the milk left over from a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, creamy, sugary, and cinnamon-y.  30% weizen and 70% bock I think, but a tasty one nonetheless.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
3778,"2002-05-21",4.0,"Nearly year old sample. Hazy yeast filled peach, not all the crud from the bottle was extracted. Thin tiny bubbled light tan head. Light carbonation. Bakery fresh aroma of cookie dough with dabs of sour fruit (Granny Smith apples), light cloves and caramel. Thickish body, even ice cold. Lightly tart and heavily malted. Chewy and thick with light banana flavors and wheat malt. Traces of clove, cinnamon, vanilla and mace spiciness. Smooth and mellow with light carbonation. Lingering cookie dough and yeast aftertaste with a cinnamon apple topping. Very tasty malt/spice mix. Actually thickens as it warms. ABV is quite high, but is never noticed. Finishes as it tastes all the way through. Like banana bread with cinnamon baked apples poured on top. My kind of summer seasonal.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
3778,"2002-04-21",3.0,"Initial aroma is pure classic Weizen yeast, cloves and all.  Cloudy light golden hue, enough sediment that the bottle needed some swirling before pouring.  Flavor is quite, quite different than anything Ive ever had.  Its for sure not like Aventinus, possibly the only other true wheat doppelbock Ive had.  Starts off light, rest of the flavor profile is quite intense and sweet, with a hint of hoppiness towards the end, and with a wheaty syrupy alcoholic sensation.  How bizarre.  I think I like it...not sure....   

This really does taste equally of hefe-weizen and a strong maibock.  Try it if that sounds good to you.  

Ive discovered that letting it warm up a bit is definitely the way to go.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
3778,"2002-04-20",4.1,"Nice refreshing wheat flavor,great summer beer for those who like something with a kick.The only doppelbock I can call refreshing.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
3778,"2002-01-16",3.4,"A bit strong, but what can you expect in a dopplebock.  The wheat adds a significant bouquet to this beer as well as a pleasant maltiness.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3778,"2001-07-13",4.4,"I have never had anything like this before. Taste like weizen with the feel and kick of doppelbock.This is one of my favorite summer brews.It is nice to have a refreshing and highly alcohic beer.","USA","Master99"
