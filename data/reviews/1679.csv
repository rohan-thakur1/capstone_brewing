1679,"2008-07-07",3.3,"In short: A basic roasted stout.  No complexity but still highly drinkable
How: Tap (nitro) at brewpub
The look: Black body with a medium beige head
In long: This highly drinkable stout doesnt offer much more than smooth roasted malts flavour. Not much fruity notes here or coffee or whatever.  The hops dry out the beer but doesnt provide much flavour and/or bitterness.  Well balanced nonetheless.  Highly roasted malts, maybe a distant light chocolate taste and thats about it.  Despite its simplicity this was a rather enjoyable pint.  The mouthfeel is pleasant, its got plenty of malts and the pleasant roastiness and dryness made it a session beer that you cannot get tired of.  Those qualities makes it lack of complexity very forgivable.

1679,"2005-08-05",3.7,"Draft as sampler at arbor Brewing. Dark brown color with medium light brown head that diminshed slowly. Good stout aroma chocolat, malt and coffee. Medium to full body with creamy texture. Well balanced flavor much like aroma with a good smooth dry finish.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1679,"2005-07-30",3.3,"Very dark brown body, beige ring. The roasted grains strike in immediately from the first whiff. Floury dry nose containing a vast amount of dark chocolate and burnt malts. No sweetness noticeable in here. Extremely dry palate, kinda tart yet roasty which I rarely like the pair together, but I must recognize this is a neatly executed stout and deserves good marks. Soft medium body, ample carbonation.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1679,"2005-07-16",3.9,"Sampled on draught @ Arbor Brewing Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Black color.  Lovely aroma reminiscent of the heavenly Milestone Porter with fresh fudge, deep chocolate, coffee, and roasty and burnt malts.  Creamy texture with a medium body.  Dynamic malt flavor with acceptable bitterness and a range of flavors.  The last beer of the day where I visited four breweries, so the notes are a little lacking, but I sampled this with their chocolate cake and it was lovely.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
1679,"2005-05-29",3.6,"Rich roasted malt aroma. Dark red with a ring of off-white lace, which is pretty impressive given the non lace, non head nature of most of Arbor brews in my sampler. Not bad. Good initial mouthfeel. Lively carbonation on tongue. Not bad at all.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1679,"2005-02-13",3.2,"Tap at brewery: Started out very average, near black with small tan head and some lace. The aroma has notes of toasted and burnt malts, mocha, light nut, floral hops and a dusty ester. The taste also was subdued with a basic balance and some bitters throughout. As it warmed some fruity components appears on the palate and improved the overall impression of the beer. This beer requires a full pint and the opportunity to warm.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1679,"2005-01-15",2.7,"Tap: almost no aroma with minimal flavor. Very dry bitter finish. Just o.k.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
1679,"2005-01-15",3.0,"Tap.  Yep, like a Guiness.  Dry and a bit chalky.  Deep black color with a tan long lived head.  A little thin in body.  Smooth mouthfeel.  Hints of hop bitterness at the finish.  Fair.","Alabama, USA","11026"
1679,"2005-01-14",3.2,"On tap:  Real light malt and coffee aroma.  Dark brown, virtually black, with a tan head.   Nice lacing.   All black coffee flavor from start to finish.  Some bitterness in the finish.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1679,"2004-12-30",3.3,"Sample at the brewpub.  Dark unfiltered molasses hue with just a wisp of lasting head...roast chocolate and a faint nuttiness in the nose...creamy, fairly sweet throughout, dark espresso roastiness makes an appearance at the finish...just a tad thin for a stout I think, the finishing bitterness isnt held up well in the body and doesnt feel quite right.  Still, not bad if not one of this fine brewpubs best.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1679,"2004-11-08",3.4,"Run of the mill Irish stout, even describes as a guinness knock-off.  Nice chocolate flavors are wrestled behind dry chalky  blandness. Creamy and roasty aftertaste. Decent.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
1679,"2004-10-31",3.7,"Draft at Arbor Brewing Company Pub & Eatery. Poured a small tan head, fair lacing, opaque, no visible carbonation, and a black hue. Aroma was malty, chocolate and roasted coffee. Flavor was malt, chocolate and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel was smooth. Recommended.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
1679,"2004-10-25",3.8,"silky milk chocolate aroma, ebony black with great belgian lace, excellent bittersweet chocolate throughout, overall very soft and inviting with lingering creaminess","Sisters, Oregon, USA","Zach Diesel"
1679,"2004-10-20",4.1,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a medium sized head of finely sized mostly lasting light brown colored bubbles that left behind a good lacing.  The body contained unnoted carbonation, was nearly opaque and dark ruby red brown in color.  Its aroma contained notes of good dark malty molasses.  Its mouth feel is initially slightly tingly with a lingering palate and a malty aftertaste.  Its flavor contained dark beer brown malts roasted notes.  A very good stout with a nice balance to it.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1679,"2004-10-13",3.6,"Chocolatey, a little roasty-smokey.  Super dark.  It became a little more complex as it warmed, as expected.  Will have again next time Im at the brewery, might try with some red meat.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
1679,"2004-04-01",4.0,"clearly a guinness clone.  very minty and chalky nose, and tastes just like it smells.  thicker and chewier than guinness.  extremely smooth, and definitely a beer fit for a session.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
1679,"2004-01-19",3.9,"Great coffee and raosted malt aroma- great looking with a good sized oatmeal colored head. Slightly acrid and burnt flavorings but they add overall to the usual culprits - not as ""dry"" (tindery, woody, all roast) as other Dry Stouts. Very drinkable.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1679,"2002-07-02",3.8,"Huge roasted bitters, bordering on burnt toast, but the toast was solid, multigrain bread so its a good thing.   Its a good, solid stout and the only real trouble I have with it is superficial nostaligia. ABC used to make a superior stout (Blackheath) that got me addicted to the brewery, so this one just stands a little pale in comparison ...","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
1679,"2002-05-22",3.5,"Fashioned after Guinness it may be, but Guinness it is not.  I dont like coffee, though, so take that for what its worth.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","brownalegirl"
1679,"2002-03-13",4.6,"Another wonderful beer by Arbor Brewing Company.  I prefer this to their Alt beer.  If you like stouts, youll love this!","Seattle, Washington, USA","tourette"
