Nose: scuffed, soft, wrinkly apples laying in rotting fallen leaves, maybe some kind of Russet. Brown bubbly melted cheese, hints of butter--really, like apple pie with burnt cheese on top (lol, thanks for the shoutout GT). 
Mouth--oily like when cheddar melts and sweats. Lighter than expected, fairly simple. Pretty, feminine acidity, but the cheesiness gets a little clunky, keeping it more rustic, less elegant. Quite a treat drinking this on the beach by Hamlets castle!","denver, Colorado, USA","ephemeral8"

130,"2011-01-04",4.4,"Extra in a trade with a BA bud. :) Shared with family in the backyard during a late summer evening.

Baby Duvel tulip. Clear amber yellow hue with a twinge of maple. Darker then the press photo shows. 2006 edition.

Scents of honey, new grass, & bold macerated apples. There is also a strong tannic sharpness in the surrounding air. Almost like a whiskey sour.

Taste is mostly comprised of sweet/hearty apples, along with lots of drying/leathery oak, tea, & just enough tartness. Tastes more like a bolder iced wine aged incredibly long in the barrel, leaving residuals of cooled brandy, must, & stiff tannins. The sugars come off deep but clean, & have less maple & caramelization then in other ice ciders. Actually, the tartness is very moderate when compared to the scent, & cuts it almost like a small lemon wedge in a large glass of iced tea.

Body isnt syrupy, but close. It is coating, velvety, & moderately lingering. The alcohol is apparent, but is only responsible for a bit of sensual cooling as it evaporates from my lips.

Not as big with the sweet/tart contrasts as others, but has more going on then most in my opinion.

130,"2009-03-01",4.0,"2005 bottle, aged over 3 years.  Still and clear, the golden hued body sits pure in the glass without carbonation of any sort.  A swirl of the glass reveals runny legging of moderate to high density.  The nose is divine, showing notes of sweet, concentrated apple mash and zesty acidity, with vanilla and hints of wildflower honey.  Theres a very light, earthy mustiness and perhaps even the faintest possible wisp of nuts.  Flavors show more of the same, striking a great balance between sweet and tart apples.  Zesty acidity is cut by the honey component, with vanilla proving itself as a perfect complement.  Showing moderate thickness and viscosity for the iced style, there is a dry tartness that lingers after the finish.  Alcohol is barely detectable despite the 12% ABV.  This one does not quite stack up to some of the elite ice ciders, but it comes in near the top of the second tier examples.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Re-rate: 2000 vintage drank in 2012. The color of the cider has gone from bright golden to dark copper.
