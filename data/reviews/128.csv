128,"2017-03-07",3.7,"Ce liquide doré est légèrement visqueux. De fines bulles montent lentement à la surface. Un beau mélange de pommes; certaines fraîches, certaines cuites en arôme. Des pointes acidulées qui nous picotent les narines. Les saveurs sont sucrée et fruitées au travers une texture soyeuse, qui est perturbée par une effervescence alternative. En fin de bouche, cest acidulé. Le clapet éprouve une certaine difficulté au passage, comme si le liquoreux mêlé aux bulles ne faisaient pas bon ménage. Cest trop épais pour être mousseux.

Nicely musty as well. Candy apple, caramel, and apple pie as well. Theres a really nice acidic quality all the way through, particularly on the finish. The same funkiness of the nose is there on the tongue, too. Good crisp apple qualities as well as some sweet sugar/caramel, a touch of green grape, and just a hint of spice.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

128,"2013-07-31",4.3,"Bottle, shared with my wife (begrudgingly, as this ice cider business is becoming one of my new favourite things). Deep burnished brassy orange with medium sized carbonation that clings to the sides of the glass. Aroma is beautiful buttery caramel shortbread and apples, luscious!

128,"2013-06-28",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2013 Corked 375ml. Short lived effervescent head settles quickly into a rose-hued clear amber pool. Fragrant floral red apples. Very clean, but also a tad ""browned"". Cedar, vanilla, rose petals, peach, honey and lemon-accents on a lush apple core. Tangy, spicy, acidic and wonderfully clean. Rich body, lusciously sweet. Strongly acidic, salivating and refreshing and new and wonderful. Spicy, peppery, jaw-droppingly poundable. The combination of carbonation and magnificently expressed apple sweetness is a new experience. I mean it almost feels like there are chile peppers in there. Its a lingering brashness in a long, sticky finish.  After a while it feels like heartburn.  But thats a wound I will suffer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Best smelling cider Ive smelled in a long time, smells of warm homemade applesauce, has a bit of the caramel acidity of ice cider.  Beautiful.  Medium bodied, velvety but with just the smallest hint of carbonation, sort of microcarbonation, very fine.  Sweet apples, a touch of acidity, light with lingering apple sugar.  Quite beautiful.  Delicious.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

128,"2011-10-16",3.6,"Bottle shared at the Cider Tasting. Pours a pale golden hue, no haze, with some lively carbonation, no head, some legs on the swirl. Aromas are pronounced apple, touches of heat, yeast, and vanilla. A touch of honey, sweetness, and funky cheese essence. Initial is a bountiful sweetness up front, rich apple, touches of honey sweetness, mellow spice, yeast, and funk. Into the middle sweet and slightly tart apples take into account, some dustings of carbonation on the palate, light yeastiness. Finish is lingering sweetness, sustained apple, touches of honey and spice make it linger on more. Gentle, with some nice sweetness, sustained flavors. Interesting.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
128,"2011-06-12",3.6,"Sampled from the bottle. Poured a deep gold with slight orange hue and no head whatsoever but visible carbonation. Aroma was sweet apples with a bit of apricot and just a hint of acid. Flavor starts sweet with apple and apricot and a growing acidity.

128,"2009-09-27",3.6,"Bottled from MaxxDaddy, to celebrate our wedding. Thanks, Max and Jess (and Jesss mom for buying this). Mildly fizzy pour, not super carbonated. The aroma is straight up unfermented cider, a touch of bell pepper, not much else. Fizzy, lightly peppery, very apple flavor, that when first opened reminded me of McDonalds. Slightly oxidized, more mellow than most ice ciders. with the carbonation having little effect on the beer, while reducing the usually very thick body into something less exciting. A pretty nice cider.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

128,"2009-02-23",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2009 Acheté à la SAQ en format de 375ml millésimé 2007 et dégusté dans un verre de cidre mystique. Apparence dune teinte jaune ambré plutôt intense avec des bulles fines et persistantes. Le tout est également agrémenté par de subtils effluves de melon miel et de compote de pomme verte et une vive acidité. En rétro olfaction, il saffirme par des saveurs de fruits confits. Révélant une texture grasse, il est assez persistant en finale dévoilant aussi un peu de gingembre et évidemment de la pomme. Leffervescence en bouche est dune agréable sensation et me procure un sentiment de plénitude. Un produit dexception et de finesse....","val-des-monts, Quebec, CANADA","grandgenie"
128,"2007-07-14",4.4,"Stylish miniature champagne bottle, this product is a assembly of their ice cider and the crémant de pomme, making this the only naturally effervescent ice cider in Québec, and probably anywhere. Ive sampled it a few times at the ciderhouse, this bottle I had in the cellar for about a year.

Olive oil golden with mighty fine legs, the fine, microscopic bubbles rised from the bottom of the glass to form a small ring around the glass. Just lovely.

Caramel apples dipped in maple syrup, after a while a bit of alcohol was present, giving away some vanilla and passion fruit effluves.

Natural carbonation makes all the difference in the world. It pushes the apple flavors to new heights while restraining the cloyness, and as you swallow the acidity kicks in and helps out to cut the sweetness even more. Its a little less rich than most ice ciders, which is normal since its blended with crémant, but it certainly doesnt lack any aftertaste. The sweet and tart apple flavors ebb and flow, going from one side of the taste spectrum to the other with every sip. The sharpness eventually wins, drying out your palate, like after a bite from a really peely, bitter apple.

Du Minot are the kings of carbonated ciders in Québec, this top of the line product proves it once again.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
128,"2007-07-06",4.1,"The pour reveals a clear, sparkling golden color with high legs. Baked apple aromas burst out of the glass with mild spices and tartness. The flavor has the usual Du Minot class and quality, again baked apples dominate and some spicy, tart elements are there, theres a nice round feel to it and it seems to balance liquorous and sharp, dryer textures. Although this is a sparkling cider it doesnt feel spritzy in the mouth. Again I have to point out that Du Minot offer quality products day in day out, from low alcohol crémants to high alcohol ice ciders, this is a fine example of their work.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
128,"2006-11-12",4.0,"A fine offering here, a paler golden juice with the casual bubble. Rather light ultimately, but it is so drinkable. Were it not 20$, this would be a staple, I never thought Id say that about an ice cider, but this could be a daily drinker. Quite an achievement. A bit like their Domaine du Minot, this is a rather focused offering, not necessarily very complex, but extracting the flavours of the apple and throwing them on our tongues with a chirurgical precision. Limited sparkling effect just adds a tingle on the tongue while the freshness invades our spirit. Fresh is a key word here, almost crisp ice cider.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
128,"2006-07-03",4.0,"Bu sur place, version pétillant. Couleur jaune fonce. Arome plus sec que Du Minot de Glace. Elle est plus légé au goût aussi. Très bon.","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
