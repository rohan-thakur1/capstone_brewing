4410,"2016-02-06",3.4,"On tap at RateBeer Best. It pours black with a small, bubbly tan head. The aroma has some intense tobacco, a little smoke and some herbal notes. Kind of dank. The flavor is strong with tar and tobacco. A little smoky with intense piney bitterness in the finish. Very heavy handed. Not as much finesse as the Zoigl or some of the other bottled products Ive had from these guys, but still an interesting beer.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
4410,"2016-02-05",3.9,"On tap @ RateBeer Best Festival. Several pours with Andreas. Somewhat murky, dark brown appearance with a really nice, lasting brown head. The aroma has herbal hops, some straw, some roasted malts, light chocolate, and earth. Medium body. Moderate low sweetness and bitterness. Well balanced. Grassy and herbal hops in the flavor. A touch of smoke. Smooth and easy to chug. Not my favorite Baltic Porter of all-time but this sure was easy to drink.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
4410,"2015-12-09",4.2,"Zwickel pour at Gänstaller Bräu. Deep brown with a permanent tan head. Intense black lager is malty in the way of roast, milk chocolate, char, ink; hoppy in the way of licorice and spice and herbs and citrus rind, strongly bitter with relatively low sweetness on a rich and savory malt texture, with perfectly fine carbonation. Its just a little young at the moment, with some sharpness to the body, but the core is sound and the effects work.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
