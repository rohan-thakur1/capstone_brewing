1961,"2015-11-19",3.7,"Type: 12-oz. draft
Glass: Clear snifter glass
From: Alpine Beer Company pub in Alpine, Calif.
Price: $6.00
Purchased: Nov. 10, 2015
Consumed: Nov. 10, 2015
Misc.: Pizza Port tap takeover

Poured an almost pitch black color with two fingers of tan, frothy head. Great looking uneven, foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Average-to-above average retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled boozy bourbon, Jim Beam, roasted toffee and hints of roasty chocolate, but bourbon really dominates here. (Smell - 3.50)

Taste was better than the nose and more balanced. Got bourbon, rich toffee, chocolate syrup, dark chocolate and dry, dark coffee malts. Still boozy, but not as bad. (Taste - 4.00)

Full body. Thick texture. Average carbonation. Boozy finish. (Feel - 4.25)

This was a pretty good effort, although I probably overrated it a tad. I decided on a 4 overall rating just ahead of a 3.75. (Overall - 4.00)

1961,"2012-02-06",3.7,"Draft at Toronado San Diego. 

Pours a dark chestnut brown color thats almost black with a thin off white head that quickly settles.  No lacing.

Roasted malt aroma with a subtle barrel presence that doesnt overpower the base beer.  Much more tame than the other Pizza Port BA beers I tried.  Nice bourbon presence along with some vanilla and toasted oak but that barrel character is a bit faint for my liking.  Lots of dark roast malt and sweet chocolate notes with hints of caramel, toffee and coffee.

Medium bodied with a spicy barrel presence.  Not much heat with moderate bourbon flavor along with some vanilla and dry oak.  I usually prefer BA beers where the barrel/spirit do not overpower the other notes but this beer could use a bit more barrel character.  Lots of sweet malt notes with hints of chocolate, coffee bean, toffee and oatmeal.  Subtle roast countering the sweetness.  Well balanced but a bit tame.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
1961,"2012-01-06",3.8,"Phone rate, $5 6oz pour at Toronado SD.  Black with a small big-bubbled tan head, down to a thick ring within a minute or two. pretty strong wet wood and bourbon nose, roast and light dark fruits follow with a light meaty note. Flavor has moderate old woody and  bourbon notes, a bit hot and peppery, with some good chocolate and roast following,  a tinge of smoke to follow. Dry finish, only tad burnt. Dry, roasty finish with bitterness at a 3-4. Quite low carbonation with a medium body. Pretty solid.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

1961,"2011-05-22",3.9,"Draft @ OB Pizza port.  Smells better than the. Reg.  Version...a little vanilla, graham cracker, and bourbony alcohol.  Black pour...not much head.  Sweet bourbon flavors atop some maltiness...gets rid of the annoyingly boring flavors of the normal version, especially the roastiness...here we just get sweet bourboon vanilla, chocolaty vanilla, and thats about it, but thats all we ask for sometimes.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1961,"2011-05-21",3.9,"Served on tap at Port OB at their 1st Anniversary celebration. The appearance is a deep black brown without too much head either. I had this one after the coffee version. The aromas are very nice. Good bourbon notes with the malts being able to shine through more because this one is no where as hot as the coffee version today. The flavors are bourbon, oak, dry roasted malts, bakers chocolate. The dryness of the base beer really comes through even after the barrel aging. I cannot recall a barreled beer being as dry as this. Pretty interesting. I preferred the coffee version but this one is quite nice.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
