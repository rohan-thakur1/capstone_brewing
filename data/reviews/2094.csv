Looks: Translucent golden honey colour with a cloud of misty yeast particles; Two finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing and very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant Ale malt, with strong passion fruits, canned peaches, pineapples, honey, strong floral, sugar, bread, strong yeast, lemon and light grass.

Taste: Close to light sweet Ale malt, with wheaty tartness, light grapefruits, citrus, yellow fruits, floral, light molasses, biscuits, strong yeast, light lemon, fair bitter hops and grass.

Body: Mid to light body. Thin but creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Solid maltyness in a slightly watery yet very smooth background with notable wheaty tartness. Low-fi grapefruit and citrus echo the floral and pretty light sweetness. Yeasty with light lemon to round. Light and refreshing!

Hoppiness: Strong passion fruits, canned peaches, pineapples, strong floral, lemon and light grass in nose. Light grapefruits, citrus, yellow fruits, floral, light lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is close to medium for a lasting, fairly astringent grassy finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Smooth and light bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is pretty much in the mould of Session IPA with very nice tropical fruity aroma, yet taste is light touch of malt and hops with smooth palate and relaxing impression on all fronts.

2094,"2012-02-20",4.1,"660ml from Alexander Wines, Coventry. Enough to share...but too good to give away. Pours bright gold to weizen hazy (depending on the DTs) with a fine, clinging foam. Beautiful hop aroma of lychee, passion fruit, slight cheesiness with a good sweat of greenery behind it. Lean and crisp with crackery, peanut malts beneath a bittersweet, citrusy stew of hop. Notes of ganja, Rubicon, general lemon and lime soapiness, flowers. Thick and translucent with the gunk in like Kernel. Top stuff.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
2094,"2012-01-25",4.3,"04/02/2011 Brasserie 4:20 (cask). Dorata viva con riflessi ambrati, schiuma praticamente assente. Aroma deciso, elegantemente amaro, con note fruttate di pesca e pompelmo ed erbacee, lievemente caramellate. In bocca ha un sapore più amaro, secco e deciso della Southern Star, grazie alla luppolatura americana, che però non risulta mai invadente. Secca, con spiccate note citriche. Corpo medio, carbonazione soft. Freschissima, pulita, elegante e beverina.","Rome, ITALY","Mortlach"

2094,"2011-10-29",4.1,"Szép világossárga színű sör hab nélkül, ahogy az egy frissen csapravert jó állapotú real ale-től elvárható. Nagyon érdekes és erős aromája van. Először gumicukornak tűnik, aztán licsire asszociálunk, végül beugrik: mangó. Tökéletes és összetéveszthetetlen mangóíze van. A teste könnyű, vizes, egy kicsit mégis olajos. Némi kis tengervizes sósság is vegyül bele, ha jól emlékszem, bár ezt a jegyzeteim nem támasztják alá. Az utóíze a könnyed komlóé.","HUNGARY","tonycaviar"
