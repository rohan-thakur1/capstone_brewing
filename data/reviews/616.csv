Good sweet stout by Tree House, though these all sort of blur together after awhile (maybe throw in some hot peppers or something sometime to change things up?).","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"

616,"2016-10-19",4.2,"Canned 9/23/16, drunk 10/6/16.Dark, milk chocolate brown body with darker mahoganies and a light tan head atop that shows moderate retention. Clarity not determined.Vanilla-tinged milk chocolate plays against light acidity from roasted barley/malt as plums, raisins and prunes all swim up slowly from the malty depths. Fudge, vanilla cream, caramel - its all here and yet I find this much more balanced than any of the ""Shot"" series beers. Not as much of a lactose character, or perhaps its just masked better by the cocoa? Not sure, but the balance here is superb with velvety, gooey fudge and chocolate nicely balanced by dry vanilla and coffee-like acidity. No alcohol or flaw.If it seems aromatic and balanced from the nose, its even more so in the flavor. Rich, velvety fudge and vanilla notes are balanced by a prune, espresso and burnt toffee acidity. Intensely soft texture with low but tight carbonation. Sweet, at times, but still showing ample attenuation. Not nearly as much lactose as the Shot series, Ill reiterate, and I love it for that. Milk and dark chocolate notes lingering with fruity and earthy coffee. Wonderfully drinkable and surprisingly balanced.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
