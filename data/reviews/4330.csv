Dark amber with a pinch of orange thrown in there, the head was slightly off-white and held up pretty well, lacing was minimal and spotty, but what was left stuck around for a bit.

The aroma picked up sweet, toasty molasses, honey, and cane sugar with oxidation providing complexity rather than hurting the experience.. sticky-sweet and malty, with any semblance of hops long gone.  The flavor found molasses, honey, and rum character at the core, laced with dry black peppery alcohol and some oxidation.. sticky on the finish with a warm, boozed up brownie impression.. tasty stuff!  Medium-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. nicely warming and spicy.. this held up very well with age, and to me was a better version of Anchor OSA.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

4330,"2009-01-23",3.8,"2001 Vintage. The aroma is of strong floral hops even after 8 years, chocolate, roast, a touch of oxidation, and I was gonna say brown sugar, but molasses is pretty much what it was. Pours a nice shade of reddish brown with a thin bubbly head that stuch around for a little while. The flavor is hoppy, and pretty bitter initially. This bitterness lingers and is followed by chocolate, roast, molasses, and then more dry hop flavors in the finish. This aged extremely well, as there was only minor oxidation that flattened out some of the flavors a bit, but it worked. There was still nice carbonation and lots of hops. This was really enjoyable all things considered.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

As it airs, the pinyness becomes more prevalent (is it the power of label suggestion?). I taste the malt first, which initially echoes the smell of butterscotch, going into a pine/hop/roasted malt flavor.  A nice smooth texture.  The finish is a bit smoky and peaty.

4330,"2006-06-07",3.0,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained 30-Nov-05 in trade with Larry Pitonka, thanks André!) Out of the bottle, this beer pours a ruddy brown color with a slight haze, and the small beige head settles to a wide ring within a few minutes.  The initial aroma and flavor are piney, herbal and hoppy with a moderately roasty malt base.  Fairly strong flavor, but quite enjoyable at first.  But I have to wonder if there isnt something with the hopping methods applied by LaConner these days because, again, Im getting kind of a funky aroma and flavor that is bordering on rotten vegetables.  Its mild though, and wasnt there when I first opened the beer, but the longer this beer is open, the harder it is to overlook this.  Body is medium to full, the carbonation level is moderate, and the hops keeps the palate relatively crisp for this dark and heavy a beer.  As a whole, I liked this beer okay, and it was definitely better when I first opened it up, but it really fell apart in the end.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Pours dark with red hlighlighgts and a modest head. The aroma packs a serious punch of of big spruce hops and blast of well-roasted malt. The flavor is strong and sharp, with the too-common threefold aggression (hops, dark malts, alcohol) of the less impressive PacNW winter ales. No balance here, but rather a set of overly-strong flavors competing with one another and leaving the palate battlegroung as scorched-earth. Bitterness and aggressive malt and sticky-sweet oils all clash with one another.

4330,"2004-01-06",3.1,"Light brown color with a very thin (none) head. Roasted malt that tasted of caramel. Alcohol was all over this. Very mild hop taste.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
4330,"2003-12-15",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2005 dark clear amber with a thin sheet of froth climbing the sides of the glass...dark caramel and nice hop background...good bitterness but staying balamced and nice...hides alcohol well.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
4330,"2003-12-12",3.8,"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty. A medium bodied Christmas Ale. Malts are nutty, fruity and sweet. Hops are spicy and grapefruity. A nice, spiced X-mas beer, brewed in the English Strong Ale tradition. Nicely balanced. Fairly smooth. No alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
4330,"2003-01-30",4.0,"Carmelly tangy flavors and dark amber in color.  Sweet tasting with some candy flavors.  Hops are present but the malt and yeast provides the largest portion of the flavor profile.  Very nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","schm1005"
4330,"2003-01-16",3.8,"Dark burgandy color, red hues. Very rich looking but thin head.  Very strong, good flavor but too hard to get over the strong alcoholic taste.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","herbstress3"
4330,"2003-01-13",3.5,"Amber with lasting beige head. Toasty chocolate malt nose. Roasted , slightly cloyingly sweet flavor","Surrey, British Columbia, CANADA","Crit"
4330,"2002-12-20",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2003 Re-Rate 12/7/2002 - Had this beer on tap. This time it had carboation and everything about it was better.   Rate 12/5/2002 -Dark amber in color, no head. A thick malty aroma grabs you by the nostrils and screams Christmas! Damit Christmas! Very intersting toffee aroma that can be broken doen into vanilla, caramel, and spice. Sweet flavor with a bitter finish and aftertaste. The low carbonation turns me off a bit. Interesting winter beer. If it had better carbonation I would think everyone should try it.","Starkville, Mississippi, USA","baobubba"
4330,"2002-12-18",3.8,"Starts of a sweet cloying note (cough syrup).  Dark garnet color with not so much of a head but dots of white whisping across the top.  Strange deep dark cellar full of chrismas stuff with swarthy nerdowells swiggin rum out of carmel covered takards  in the corners.  Out side the malt rain turns to slush on spruce street.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
4330,"2002-12-07",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2003 The perfect winter beer. I have been looking hard for a winter beer that actually contains some winter-time qualities, not some overly hopped seasonal brewed for those long winters in Southern California.  I'm from the Northwest dammit, I need something to warm my ass. This is initially bitter with a nice flavorful hop presence, but this is soon overshadowed by a wonderful swell of rum and caramel that is reminiscent of egg-nog. My compliments go out to the little brewery over there in LaConner.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"
4330,"2002-11-28",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2003 This was quite unique. Some   rum/vinous taste to the beer. Very thick and somewhat sweet with a fruity and malty complexity. Very good beer. Underrated. Get this. ReRate 12-2003: AWESOME. Dry cascade hops in the aroma. Taste is big, sweet, and full. Rum flavors still there. So damn mellow. Hops creep in at the end but are so subtle.  I want to age this- if I can find any more.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
4330,"2002-11-11",3.6,"While having a lovely maroon cidery appear that lacks a head aside from a sparse ring of bubbles, this adequately named beer is a liquid Christmas tree in aroma and flavor.  Floral (Cascade?) hops interplay with english candy malts in both aroma and flavor--though the former is slightly more pleasing. Nicely balanced winter selection with some bitter/sour notes on finish.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
4330,"2002-11-09",4.1,"dark brown.  malt and sweet sprucy flavors.  pretty hoppy - but an even mix between spiciness and bitterness - works out to a nice bite on the finish. some alcohol taste.  splits the difference between the malty-sweet seasonal beers and the hopped-over-the-top ones.  very warming.  excellent winter beer.","USA","rich42"
