204,"2015-04-23",3.5,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle. It pours a clear yellow/gold color with moderate carbonation and a thin head. I didnt get much of an aroma.. If anything, I thought I got a whiff of butterscotch and I guess some light bread malt. There is some hop bitterness in the flavor, which I like. The body has a nice crispness. This is not the best beer Ive ever had and also not the worst. I would probably buy it at a bar if they had it on draft... depending on what else was available..","Massachusetts, USA","bavarian81"
204,"2015-01-07",3.4,"Sampler at the source. Pours yellow gold with a white head. Aroma is caramel, wheat. Flavor is caramel, bread, slight citrus, a bit of pepper spice.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
204,"2014-11-28",3.0,"Sampled at the brewpub, pours a clear gold with some lacing, ringing white head. Nose has malt, mild perfume, a little grass, some mild melon. Flavor has lemon, straw, some melon again, a little metallic. Watery finish.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
204,"2014-07-22",3.2,"Tap at the brewery. Pours clear gold with a small, fizzy white head, short retention with spare lacing. Aroma is sweet corn and Pils malt with earthy and spicy hops. Flavor is malt dominant, Pils malt with light hops and medium bitterness and a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
204,"2014-06-30",3.5,"Bomber into tulip. Hazy golden yellow, moderate persistent white head. On the nose, Id swear its a hefe -- wheaty, a hint of fruit. In the mouth, its fairly hoppy on the entry, picks up a grainy mid, and finishes with resinous hops. Decent, but Id like the hops dialed back just a bit.","West Hartford, USA","Slubgob"
204,"2014-01-09",3.3,"Features the usual light bready aroma and also some spiciness and grass. Lighter yellow, and while heady, its still for a Kolsch Id say. Initial bitterness followed by a sharp dirt finish. Exceptional crispness. What Kolsch needs as a style is more hops...and it;s covered here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","Scrapersnbeer"
204,"2013-10-25",4.5,"Excellent Kolsch, slightly heavy on bittering hops = perfect. Initial bitterness followed by mild sweetness, finished by a pleasantly lingering bitterness. Great beer.

Comes to the table a lightly hazy gold with a smallish white head that persists. Nice sweet bready pilsner malt nose with a hint of honey and floral spicy hops. The flavor is a touch on the sweet side with an almost under attenuated quality to it. Sweet honey caramel and pilsner malt with a touch of spicy hop and a hint of diacytyl. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. Its a touch sweet, but I could get behind a few of these.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

204,"2009-07-21",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2010 My Bottom Line:
Persistent hay and spicy, herbal hops coalesce in this snappy and harmonious Kölsch.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam decorates the hazy straw blonde. Head retention could be improved for this to be world-class.
-The nose is more subtle than the flavor profile.
-The smooth effervescence and well rounded body make for a smashing mouthfeel.
-The flavors are well balanced and perfectly structured; a perfect union of authentic ingredients.
-The cereal presence in the flavor profile is stupendous.

On tap at both the Torrington and Granby locations.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Pours a clear soft honey golden with some faint pinkish highlights and a one finger white head with tiny tiny bubbles, decent retention.  Aroma of sugar cookies, bready malts, grassy and lightly earthy hops--fairly sweet overall.  Lots of sugar cookie and bread doughy malts, light grain, and a fair amount of bitterness (4 out of 10) from the grassy and earthy hops.  I even got a hint of lemon somewhere.  Dry finish with no lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel is creamy with soft light to moderate carbonation.  This was very enjoyable and so easy drinking that the bottle was gone within 10 or 12 minutes, and I was trying to pace myself.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

204,"2006-10-05",4.1,"If you served this to me right in the center of Cologne, Id have no idea it was an American production, and Id rate it up there with the best 3 or 4 that Ive enjoyed. Really quite authentic tasting, the first American Kolsch that is a true Kolsch. The pour was alarming in a pint glass (wheres my stange?) and the head wasnt as fluffy and pretty as it should have been. However, the aroma was rich and awesome, good musty (even wood-like, not sure if they age this in wood barrels or not), light honey, and light bready character. The flavor captured all of that and presented a nicely balanced beer, somewhat dry and carbonated finish, far superior to the ""big"" Cologne products like Sion or Dom. One of my favorite recent beer experiences.","","User37895"
204,"2006-09-12",4.2,"BCTC thanks to DYC for the growler.  Perfect beer to start out a hot day on the day before the fest.  Pours a light chill haze, then clears as it warms and a thin lasting head and good lacing.  Aroma is lightly fruity, some herbal and spicy hints and even some nice noble hops.  Lightly sweet malt, herbal and flowery with a light refreshing spice.  Nice hoppy bitter finish.  Very refreshing and delicate beer.  Awesome Kolsch.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
204,"2006-08-27",4.0,"07.14.06  From growler, thanks to DYC, BCTC.  Golden stuff, maybe a touch of green tint, maybe thats the grass that surrounds us.  Theres something perfect about drinking a Kolsch in the middle of a field as the aromas of grasses and grains surrounding me compliment the well rounded and superbly bread doughy malts in this beer.  Quickly fading white head was initially lofty and laces.  Creamy stuff, bursting grain fruits in every sip, zero bitterness.  Finish is a ghost, as it leaves barely a trace of itself behind on the palate.  What a quencher.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
204,"2006-08-22",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a crisp, clean yellow color. The taste is light and refreshing but rich; flavors of lemongrass, hay, and some apple too. This is bone dry; it finishes as clean as it looks. 5.1 ABV isnt high, but whats there is undetectable. Malt isnt too prominent here, but enough to give it some weight and help balance out the hops. Kolsch isnt my favorite style, but I tried it after seeing the high style percentile rating. I was not disappointed; this is a tasty and satisfying light beer.

204,"2006-07-23",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 24, 2006 Growler samples from DYCSoccer at BCTC 06.Medium clarity, nice to see some slight haziness, enough to signify low filtration.  Warm honey-toned is the brassy-gold body.  Plastered atop is a small but very stable white head that seems immovable.  Wispy lacing is quite apparent.The nose explodes with a perfect combination of Cologne yeast, lightly papery, hints of chalk and light sulfates with a touch of apple skin.  Pear skin is overlaid on top and you get an almost extremely-dry-chardonnay-effect.  So immensely crisp I can barely remember any more snappy an aroma than this.  Hops are dry, grassy and herbal.  Well done to style and just dripping with aromatics.  Only the slightest bit of honey seeps through, but it is just enough to suggest balance.  Dry biscuits progress as it warms, lightly grainy and further adding dryness.  It never gets too dry though, as the light sweetness on the end and the dry green and yellow fruit-notes are well-balanced.  No alcohol whatsoever, and just a study in Cologne yeast.The light pils malt in the aroma translates a bit more in to the flavor.  As I take a sip, the tongue is lightly washed in honey, but nearly immediately, the hops add a subtle herbal note as the yeast crackles with snappy, flavorful dryness.  More pear skin and fresh white grape-notes slowly transition in to a hint of slight caramel and a touch of chewy, moist biscuits.  Tight, low carbonation completes the picture.  Im on the fence with the palate score.  It seems there is a slight bit of vapidity on the end and the yeast crispness seems to falter slightly, whereas I would envision a finish and aftertaste with heavy crisp dryness.  I could see a touch of lactic-like notes adding a bit more depth, but this is extreme criticism and would be extremely difficult to replicate.  Anyways, one hell of an authentic Kolsch.  Not thin in the least.For me personally, its satisfying to see the brewer from the first brewpub I started drinking beer at make a top- notch beer like this.  Not that I ever doubted he could.  Hes come a long way from Skaneateles Light.  Thanks again for bringing this, Casey.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
