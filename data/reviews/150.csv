Has an utmost soft mouthfeel, creamy with a medium, malt relying body, featuring a lively carbonation burst, tickling the tongue during the finish.

Tastes of milk chocolate, bitter cocoa nibs, which add to the complexity of the silk chocolate, and toasted hazelnuts.

Aroma of beef stock cube and even gravy, walnut, home made caramel, dry liquorish candy, dried porcini, bitter chocolate, vague glue-like solvent effect but nothing disturbing. Sweet onset, hints of candied figs and dates, sourish undercurrent, beef stock-like umami accent from the nose returning immediately after the sweetness, softish carbo perfectly fit for the style, smooth oily mouthfeel, caramelly malt core with bitter chocolatey and mildly toasted ending, pleasant spicy hop notes blending in very well, lingering with the toasted malt bitterness, a tad grapefruity in the end, with a mild suggestion of warming alcohol. Very accomplished, rounded, easily drinkable porter, perhaps a bit too much tilted to the umami side for this style but I can see how this quality level in combination with limited production and even more limited distribution can create a hype.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

150,"2015-11-11",4.1,"500 mL bottle. No bottle date. Originally reviewed 6/22/2012/

Pours a black body that is translucent at the edges. Billowing mocha head that almost overflows the glass. Excellent retention and even some nice lacing.

Chocolate and coffee dominate the nose. Some booze, which is surprising for 7.5%. A deep, ashy, almost burnt character persists in the background, perhaps detracting from other aromas.

Coffee and chocolate are the most dominant flavors. It really mirrors the aromas, even in the relative proportions of the flavors. The finish is bitter, but seemingly from that ashy burnt character. Again, its slightly boozy.

I had this on tap and it seemed much heavier and more viscous than it does in the bottle. Its medium bodied, but slick on the tongue. The bitter ashy finish is a little detracting, but otherwise its good.

 I dont find this to be earth-shattering as the reviews suggest. Its still a solid and impressive beer. Yet another technical masterpiece from Hill Farmstead, but lacking in a certain refinement that their other beers have.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

This was poured into a tulip, eh, oh well, next time mug, nonic or pint glass.
No worries, I know Sean Hill is anal about stupid shit he doesnt know, eh, whatever.
The appearance was a nice looking dark brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Light lacing surrounded the glass, thick yet not too thick as it showed enough spliced delicate thin-ness to it (adequate).
The smell started off with sweet to robust and roasty coffee and cocoa moving slowly into a real nice malty aroma.
The taste rolled into the sweetness nicely with a fairly sweet to roasty with a tad of bitter coffee blending nicely. Theres a nice semi-sweet to roasty aftertaste bleeding into a semi-dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a fairly nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nicely underneath fulfilling a fairly light quality but not too light.

150,"2015-08-24",4.4,"When you think of Hill Farmstead, you probably think of IPAs and saisons, but they do make a wide variety of styles including porter. This is my first dark beer from this highly sought-after brewery and its definitely an excellent example of the style. Robust palette with a body thats as nice on the eyes as it is on the tongue. 

I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 8/14/15 and cost $8.50 ($0.50 per ounce). Thanks to Jon H. for the bottle!

Appearance: One of the darkest porters Ive seen with a jet black, opaque hue with just a hint of brown highlights. Pours to a large, dark tan frothy head which retains and laces extremely well.

Smell: Plenty of dark malt, though not roasty or chocolaty per se. Fairly sweet scent all around with a trace of pine.

Taste: Theres a fine line between a strong robust porter and a stout and Everett seems to straddle that line pretty firmly. I dont get the lighter fruity sweetness here thats typical of a porter, but more of a deeply bitter roasty sensation usually associated with stouts. Not that Im complaining, but the flavors that are present are plenty delectable. Sweet dark malty flavor is the first component, followed by a resiny/piney sensation from the hops. Not especially bitter, though there is a dry, coffee and burnt toast-like taste on the finish. A residual earthy aftertaste completes and complements the palette perfectly. 

Drinkability: Hill Farmstead Everett is not only a great-tasting beer, its also a pleasure to drink. The mouthfeel is very silky and smooth, though it does feel just a tad thin. For a 7.2% ABV brew, there is no alcohol presence whatsoever; which makes it almost dangerously drinkable. Even the aftertaste is good, if a bit astringent but easily tolerable.

Dry roast also defines its dry mouthfeel and taste, with more chocolate, woody notes and liquorice developing at repeated sipping. Restrained caramel sweetness, maybe thinned out with age. Highly drinkable as well. - Personally prefer my Porter a tad more luscious in creamy mouthfeel, Fullers style, but the semi-heavy, fresh cocoa bean dry roast here remains well balanced and lively with subtle hop watercolours, even aged 2 years.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

150,"2015-07-29",4.3,"Draught at the brewery and Parker Pie, 7/24/15Deep ebony liquid is topped by a tan head that shows moderate retention. Undetermined clarity.The fresh, plastery, lovely Hill Farmstead yeast/water character is the first thing I notice, even before the roast. The beer just smells alive and vibrant. Light vanilla, dark chocolate and mild coffee notes are all presented very cohesively, with lush, dank, juicy hop notes adding light citrus/wintergreen aspects, but not overdone or dominant. With warming, buttercream, vanilla and milk chocolate emerge, adding more malty depth, but all the while, the roast and hops keep things in balance. Clean, wonderfully balanced and vibrantly aromatic stuff, with no sign of flaw or alcohol.The flavor displays all of the porter character from the nose, dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla, on an almost silky bed of rich malts. Much like the Mystic The Hum I just had, the flavors are all well-balanced; neither hop or roast bitterness dominates, nor does any gooey chocolate or pale malt sweetness build up. Considerably more dry than The Hum, though, without compromising any texture.Between this and Cisco Moor Porter, its close in my book. Both have the delightful house yeast character and while this is probably a little more flawlessly executed, I did love Ciscos massive oily, vinous roast/char and cigar notes; it just seemed to have even more complexity than this (though from recent reviews, it looks like Moor Porter is a shell of its former self that I remember (2005/2006)).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Strong aroma of roasted malts, some burnt notes, and some unsweetened/dark chocolate. The pour is more black than brown with a thick, frothy brown head and heavy lacing.

It feels fairly creamy and smooth with a really nice mouthfeel, soft carbonation, and a somewhat dry close.

Pours a nice black with a sheet of mocha foam. Smells robust son! Chocolate, coffee, roasted barley, coffee (faint), cocoa powder, graham and more toasted malts. Flavor follows suit with a good earthy roasted character, a strong cocoa flavor, nice bits of coffee nib, and a sweetness Im surprised at that is transient in nature and does not linger.

150,"2013-08-02",4.2,"In the late summer of this year, I lived in a house in a subdivision that looked across the swamp and the plain to the hills. I came across this beer that locals called Everett. A special mans grandfathers brother was Everett, much like this beer. I never had the chance of knowing the man, but his legacy and words will be carried, in a way, through a creation of love that bears his name. He was strong, with lots of siblings. The nose of this beer, like the man not known to you and me, has many layers. Like siblings oft-do, playing well with each-other, only to build off their strengths. It soon comes to pass, that many realize their force is greater combines than to work against each other. Some notes to be imagined, some to be grasped, like hands clenching the tools of the field. Strong hands, hard work. Strong chocolate and bitter. But not bitter in the way of wrath, but rather firm, like the hands of an old soul. This beer, like the man our minds have come to know, has a strong foundation. Sturdy feet, that have known the tasks and toils of yesteryear. A man of such traditions, must stand firm, but show the softer side for the ones that are loved. The coffee notes are reminiscent of the first cup before a long days work. The liquid libation that is needed when there is a long day ahead, and many more after that. The water in this bottle tastes not like that of any regions yonder, but of natural water, from the earth, that has seen many cycles and will continue to do so, in many forms. This beer will not be with us just today, but will continue the cycle once again, and once again. The sweetness of this beer is one that can be imagined like the man in our minds. Only after he warms up to you, does this soft, sweeter side come to shine. A side well guarded, and for good measure. For lest we know the effort that hast gone into creating such a crafted soul. As it is tasted, the senses of caramel, toffee, and the smaller joys of life come through. A beer of many layers and mystery. The German and English malts play upon each others strengths; it was not always the case throughout humanity, but save Everett, it has come to show us, the harmony of the ways. As the beer begins to fade into the hills and no longer with us, it leaves behind a drying finish. One that can only leave you to wish there was more time to be spent with it here. But the impression it leaves will be with you always. There will always be a bit of Everett once it has come into your life. And to know the best side is to know the only side of the beer created in a great mans honor. After a while I went out and left the place and walked back to the hotel in the rain. When asked about this beer and the impression it leaves, I have only to say, Yes, Isnt it pretty to think so?","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

150,"2013-05-02",4.4,"500mL bottle shared among friends at Original Gravity in San Jose. Big thanks to Seth for this one! Poured into a mini snifter glass. Escapes the bottle with a thick and oily viscosity. This batch does not appear to be very well carbonated. No head, some spotty bubbles here and there. Swirling the beer around leaves noticeable legs and no lacing. Aroma is stout-like, with lots of roasted malts, a touch of smoke/ash and faint chocolate and dark fruits hiding in there. Still very inviting. Taste is exceptional, with all that roast, sweet chocolate, smoke and coffee working together to create a perfect blend of mocha like creme brûlée with a smooth and silky finish. I was prepared for the finish to be more bitter, but instead am taken aback by how smooth and balanced this beer is. Lots of silky milk chocolate, mocha, honey, and almost nutty with a nice alcohol warmth. The body is again, perfect like all the rest of the HF beers. Carbonation is really low, but doesnt seem to affect the taste or feel of the beer at all. After taste is yet again, more of the same honey-like mocha sweetness that isnt overpowering because it is well balanced by the roasted and smokey malts. Exceptional porter and by the far the best Ive ever had. This beer is no joke.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"

150,"2013-03-05",4.1,"Bottle - thanks, Miller! Straight up one of the finest porters Ive had in recent memory. Firm, hefty-looking dark brown pour with a nice firm beige head. Consistent carbonation, nicely sticky lacing, and a rich, silken mouthfeel capped off by an enjoyable chalky finish. Richly flavorful, its the kind of hoppy porter that isnt so overly hopped that it loses the substance and personality one craves from the style. Chocolatey, roasty, with just a faint touch of dark fruits. Elegant and just superbly done.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

150,"2012-11-06",4.2,"500ml bottle. Pours out a dark brown with lots of mocha head. Pleasant but disappointingly weak aroma of toasted grain, treacle and hops. Its only when I take a sip that I realise why this beer has such a strong reputation. The taste works in such harmony that its hard to pin down the individual flavours, but its a great evocation of dark malty goodness with the perfect volume of hops to back it up. It has the right chocolate and coffee notes but works them in rather than overplaying them. The end result is a beer unafraid to stand on its own two feet rather than showcasing the best bits of other beverages. The mouthfeel is just about as good as can be; big enough to get lost in without being difficult to swallow. Just wish the aroma was a little more forceful.

150,"2012-11-01",4.5,"From bottles, on draught, this is one beer thats always been a show in itself. No matter what I was drinking before or after, it is a rare day the one in which you drink an Everett that is not the highlight of the day. And for what its worth, dark malt flavours are certainly not among my favourite features in the broad universe of beer... So cracking up an Everett and drinking it in front of the screen, here are my impressions. A vigorous beige cap stays above the close to blackness. Ashes blend lovingly around fudge in this complex malt nose where all kinds of chocolatey nuances dominate the caramel found in many a porter. Toasted pumpernickel, cigar leafy/smokiness, leather.. the flavours are broad, varied, complementary, never heading too much toward sweetness nor toward bitterness. Hops are not subtle, but are kept under control by the sheer malt presence. Round, luscious palate, never feeling heavy and certainly not syrupy, but straightly dense and compact, stealing a vanilla kiss toward the finish, but otherwise remaining disciplined, adding woodsy, truffle, coffee laden layers and inspiring the drinker to expand its dark malt aroma descriptors range. The texture is simply flawless, with just the right carbonation dosage, soft bubbles enhancing drinkability while never bringing forth more acidity and bite than required, leaving the rich maltiness the grounding area it needs to land its intricacies on the palate. Tough to imagine anything I would change.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Aroma is, oh gosh, a symphony of cocoa, dark chocolate, dried fruits, tobacco, slight vanilla, coffee, caramel malt, very faint alcohol, and a nice blend of hops in the background, wow, seriously I understand why the guy at Winooski just dumped this in my hands when I asked him to show me around and mentionned that stouts and porters were one of my favs...!!!  They had just received a case and it was almost gone 20mins later...Ok back on track!  Taste is medium-sweet, bitterness is floating in the background.  This is REALLY well-balanced; the only other American robust porter I had was Smuttynoses and although I liked that one really really much for its sugar contents and milk-chocolate like qualities, I like the Everett a bit more for its balance and more ""mature"" characteristics.

150,"2012-09-04",4.7,"22 oz bomber into a tulip glass. No clue what age/vintage it is, but I believe its somewhat fresh.

A - Pitch black body which lets zero light through. Massive fluffy mocha head. Settles down to a frothy cap with crazy amounts of retention. The foam just clings to the glass the entire time. Probably the best lacing Ive ever seen on a beer.

S - Robust indeed. Deep roasty malts, fresh espresso beans, sweet and lactic milk chocolate, and a touch of bitter mineral rich water. Finishes with sweet and rich vanilla. Perfect aroma.

T - Follows the nose with a pleasant mix of intense espresso beans, milk chocolate, vanilla and perfectly roasted malts. Just a touch of hop bitterness to work against the sweetness and richness of it all. Booze isnt present in the taste but there is a light warmth happening in the throat. 

M - Slick and coating mouth feel. Very silky with a high level of carbonation that prevents it from being cloying. 

O - The best porter Iv ever had, easily. Which sucks considering how tough it is to get bottles of this beer. Hype and availability aside, Hill Farmstead is the real deal. Unbelievable beer.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Giant and deep aroma of purplish fruit, chocolate and coffee, heavy on roast and caramelized sugars.  Flavor is similar but packed with a bit more forthright sweetness, especially heavy on a frustratingly thin vanilla note.  Medium palate; given the indicators, it ought to be heavier.  Finishes with heavy licorice and a somewhat long semi-sweet smack of maple and wood; close to an excellent example.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
150,"2012-08-10",4.2,"22 oz. from the Booyamachine himself. There was a lot of hype surrounding this beer when it was bestowed upon me. Usually that would be the death knell for any brew but this one did not disappoint. ""Robust"" doesnt even begin to describe how ballsy this beer is. Huge roast and an interesting hop profile make the finish pretty bitter. Makes for a deep an thought-provoking beer. My only qualm is that mine smelled funny. The coffee aromas are fighting with some kind of vegetal/sour smell. I think I poured it in a dirty glass, which is a shame. Now Ill never complete my BJCP.","Washington, USA","killjoy966"

Taste is very chocolatey, tobacco, licorice, dark fruits, espresso, toasted malt, earthy, chewy, and char. Getting a lot of coffee lingering in the finish and it is delicious. Seriously creamy mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Very nice beer and easily the best porter I have ever had.

A - Pours deep brown, might as well be black, with a nice one and a half finger tall mocha colored head leaving thin trails of lace down parts of the glass.

S - Smells of chocolate, coffee, molasses, licorice and plenty of dark roasted malts. A bit of smoke comes through as it sits in the glass. Very nice nose.

T - Starts off with a ton of sweet dark roasted flavors - namely coffee, chocolate and molasses - slowly giving way to some of the other flavors - licorice, smoke and a bit of dark fruit. The dark roasted malt is ever present. Finish is quite roasty but the smooth feel really helps to keep things in check.

M - Big, smooth body with a ton of dark flavors and moderate carbonation. Nice creamy feel brings everything together.

150,"2012-07-17",4.6,"Review from notes taken at Cigar City Brewing taproom on 7/15/12. Poured on draft into a Cigar City shaker pint glass.

Appearance: Pours a dark brown, almost black with a 1/2 finger light tan head. Decent lacing.

Smell: Roasted coffee, chocolate, toasted malt and white bread crust.

Taste: Milk chocolate, roasted malt and coffee throughout. Aftertaste is bitter coffee with a touch of sweet chocolate. Extremely well-balanced. Excellent flavor.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. I could drink this all day.

Overall: Excellent beer overall. Maybe the best porter (its really close to a milk stout in my opinion) Ive ever had. Its extremely well-balanced and smooth. Id recommend trying this one if you get a chance. I hope Im lucky enough to get some bottles of Everett at some point.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"
150,"2012-07-16",4.3,"My first from HF. Very excited for this one! Poured into a Highland pint glass. 

Pours a deep foreboding black. Heavy and scary looking. A great finger width of luscious mocha-head rests atop. The nose is rich with roasted malt, coffee grounds, dark breads, molasses. Well-rounded aroma invites me to partake. 

For the style, the feel holds up wonderfully. Velvety chewy mouth with a moderately-full heft to it. This is not an easy drinker, and thats fine by me. Holds up the decadence of the flavors perfectly. The beer is overflowing with rich, malty goodness. Roasted coffee stands out, followed by a not-unpleasant burst of charred bread. Semi-sweet chocolate, cut oats on the finish. Fantastic Porter. One of the best. Id love to have this one again.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

150,"2012-07-09",4.3,"Ive had this beer on a few occasions but this is the first time reviewing it. Picked this up at the brewery on Saturday. Enjoyed at Cellar Temp (60 Degrees F) in a HIll Farmstead Glass on a warm summer afternoon.

A - Poured a dark brown to black out of the bottle. Appearance post-pour is pitch black with brown bits along the edge of the glass. Head of 1-finger brown like coffee that sticks around for a very long time fading slowly. 

S - Very dry roasted malts, hint of bakers chocolate orange citrus and liquorice. Some coffee and tobacco. 

T - Wow. Up front, this very burnt dark malts taste of liquorice and smoke. Smoked malts for sure in this on and a touch of vanilla. Coffee and Chocolate follow with the finish of roasted espresso beans. Theres this very light and almost floral texture at the finish that makes you thirsty to take another drink. 

M - 40% carbonation on the mouth swish. Medium body with a light candy like finish.

O - This beer comes in growler filles (750ML / 2L) and 500ML bottles. Its hard to imagine sharing anything less than 750ML with a friend. This beer is the most delicious and drinkable porter Ive ever had. I dont drink too many of them because they tend to be very bitter at the finish, mouth drying or too boring on the palate. This beer looks, smells, tastes and finishes perfectly and the 7.5% ABV is not noticeable at all despite any cheapening effects such as vanilla or oak chips.

150,"2012-04-20",4.5,"750ml growler picked up from the brewery yesterday. Pours a black body with an inch thick, dense and creamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a gorgeous lacing throughout. Aroma is awesome with rich dark chocolates, piney hops, and roasts giving off some tobacco. Some citrus to the resiny pines, a touch of coffee, and a hint of nutty toffee behind the roasts and hops. Flavor is just as impressive with rich dark chocolates, slightly chewy toffees, and plenty of roasts and hops. Resiny pines with some citruses, a light tobacco, some wood, a touch of coffee, and a hint of nuts and raisins. Resiny hops, roasts, tobacco-wood, and a touch of licorice grows into the end as this finishes dry, but ultra soft and smooth with a very rich dark chocolate and touch of chewy maltiness alongside a medium bitterness. Lengthy aftertaste following a decadent, silky smooth, medium body and a super soft, moderate carbonation.

Tons of decadent chocolates and a hint of slightly chewy toffee with plenty of resiny, piney hops giving off a light citrus and a full, balanced, hard roastiness giving off a touch of tobacco and coffee. Such a wonderful palate on this beer as well. Wow.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a smooth, rich, robust mouthfeel. Man, oh man, this is good.

150,"2012-03-15",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/22/2012.  Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a snifter.

With a fairly aggressive pour, there is a nice, tightly wound mocha brown cap. The head retains nicely and leaves some nice spotty lace all over the glass.

The aroma and flavor are both very smooth. Dark roasted malt contains dark semi-sweet chocolate and creamy espresso flavor with no smokey or burnt character. 

The flavor starts with that malt, and the malt and chocolate linger through the middle of the flavor, ending with a semi-sweet creamy espresso note. There is a soft spicy pine hop note right at the end. 

The mouthfeel is worth noting separately. The flavors integrate well with the smooth body and creamy carbonation.

I havent been blown away with the Hill Farmstead beers I have had so far, but this was very impressive. At this point I would say it is one of the best porters I have had.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

150,"2012-02-25",4.0,"50 cl bottle. Black pour with a lovely and quite large light brown head. The aroma comes off rather hoppy at first with citrus orange. Quite surprising to be honest. Beneath the rather massive hoppiness, there is chocolate, sweet liquorice and roasted notes, but I think it takes a bit too much for me to smell through the hops. Though as it warms considerably, the malt complexity finally unravels; burned caramel and toasted nuts, lush chocolate and bitter coffee, even a hint of cinnamon and chocolate cake crust. The taste is magnificent. Roasted malts play with coffee, cocoa and liquorice, and hops bring a refreshing whiff of citrus. Both malts and hops contribute to the bitterness in the end of the taste, both liquorice root-like and hoppy. Drinks way to easy for a 7,5% porter. Very balanced and easy on the palate. Easily one of the best porters Ive had, though I think it is a tad too hoppy especially below 12 degrees celsius.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"

Skinny flares and trailing spots jut out from the surface, sheepishly holding on to the glass.  The aroma is all about the bold (yet smooth) roast, booming with notes of dry dark cocoa, roasted barley, and even a bit of meaty smoke.  Theres just a touch of blackened caramel sweetness, but not too much.  Despite being a formidable brew, the superior attenuation is immediately apparent.  Flavors closely match the nose, packing that same dark, dry roasted feel, with just the slightest taste of balancing cocoa-caramel sweetness on the back end.  Toasted pumpernickel bread and roasted nuts are not out of the question, and again, some welcomed smokiness is involved.  The palate manages to display plenty of substance while maintaining a relatively dry consistency, with perfectly delicate carbonation levels.

4.5 A: Black color. First pour yielded over a hand of head, but I got a full glass on my second pour. Three fingers of super creamy/pillowy light brown head with excellent retention and tons of ungodly thick lacing. This would have easily been a perfect score if I only needed one pour to achieve this.

4.0 S: Coffee and chocolate are the main attraction here with smoke and dark crystal malts not far behind. Good amount of roastiness as well, which strikes a good balance between the sweet maltiness. This smells very nice as is, but would be amazing if all the aromas were amplified a bit.

4.5 T: This is really tasty. Again, theres lots of coffee and chocolate. A peaty twang is there along with smoke. A healthy bit of caramel sweetness gives this robust porter the robustness. Lots of sweet maltiness overall, which is again balanced nicely by the roastiness. The taste is a lot like the nose, just more powerful.

5.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Super creamy, especially for the ABV. Cant get much better than this.

4.5 D: This is a very good beer. Its quite robust overall, but no flavor is out of place or too strong. Really great beer that didnt need to be more than 7.5% to be delicious.

Theres a light touch of smoke in the background. The flavor is dominated by chocolate and coffee. Light smoke and sweetness with some roast there as well. Medium body with good carbonation. Nice and creamy. Alcohol is not noticeable. Really solid brew.

The aroma is nice and hoppy, rather piney like a black IPA but with considerable roasty/charcoal notes.  Somewhat smoky with dark chocolate notes.  The flavor is (sorry Ive only watched this show once but it applies here) LEGEN...wait for it...and it would be crazy if they used lactose in this beer because here comes the...DARY.  Damn this flavor is big, and it is good.  So much flavor and so much complexity.  Dark chocolate, roast, piney hops, and...well...awesomeness to be honest.

150,"2011-06-09",4.1,"Tap at Capones  Best porter I have had to date. The appearance was spot on. Pours black. Im not sure if the dense, dark tan head would have ever fully dissipated. It sat for 30 minutes and did not diminish at all, so who knows. Great lacing. Aroma is fresh cut wood, roast, vanilla, chocolate and some hazelnut. Taste is similar, but without the intense hazelnut. Probably the least impressive part for me, but still really good. Palate is thick and creamy, full-bodied. Really blurs the porter/stout line.

bottle sampled next to Founders Porter just to see how close these beers really are. Everett was a few months fresher. Both pours pitch black but Everett poured initially with a creamy tan head but both heads didnt last long, Founders head was fizzier. Both beers have a big dark chocolate aroma but Everett had more depth with sweet brown sugar and currant notes. Taste wise Founders porter was a bit ashier while Everett had a big dark fruit sweetness with some tobacco and molasses to it. Overall both beers are similar, I think Everett has more depth and a better mouth feel but Founders Porter is great too. Recipe wise Everett uses Roasted barley while Founders Porter uses black patent. Both stellar porters. The more recent batches have been killer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Pours black with two full fingers of thick tan head. Shaun knows his aesthetics. Ridiculous lacing. The only complaint is that the second pour yields almost too much head (four full fingers).

Smoky roast coffee, tons of milk chocolate, dark fruit and a nice milky creaminess. Toffee sweetness alongside a really pleasant spiciness. The sweeter and milky parts remind me of Velvet Merkin, but this features much more spicy balancing complexity and ""robust,"" smoky elements.

Both milk and [xx%] cocoa dark chocolate, espresso roast coffee beans, peppercorn, and an ashy smokiness. The spicy oak found in the -bal version is here too. How? - I have no idea. More or less maps onto the nose.

At first, this has too much carbonation - medium-bodied, with full, expanding-in-the-mouth carbonation. Thirty minutes later, the creaminess characteristic of HFS comes through, and the body feels appropriately fuller.

Different, but pleasantly so. Its almost exactly what I expected - spicy, somewhat smoky, rich, quietly oaky, with coffee and chocolate. A winner.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

How: Tap at Hill Farmstead Winter Gathering 2011
The look: Black body topped by a persistent small tan head
In long: Hoppy and roasted nose with green resinous hops over a burnt chocolate cake, almost black-ipa-ish aroma.  Taste has a nice malt complexity, medium roasted, creamy chocolate cake, caramel, raisins, molasses.  Then comes a truckload of leafy resinous hops.  Full and lively body.  I could drink gallons of this.  Holy crap this was good.  Ive heard it is based on the Ølfabrikken Porter (brewery with whom Hill Farmstead brewer worked) except that Everett is cranked-up the American way.  The first time I visited that brewery I was blown away.  Hill Farmstead is truly the absolute best new American brewery, and certainly one of the top best brewery on the planet.  Im positive about that.  The only thing that could make me more positive would be a smoking hot horny hot chick with HIV.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Raisins, molasses and dark chocolate thrive in this sumptuous Robust Porter, effortlessly moving into a levelled bitterness of resinous hops and roasted malts. I cannot imagine a better Robust Porter.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the brown-edged black, lacing nicely.
-The mouthfeel is chewy, crunchy and nourishing, yet lets itself be drunk easily.
-Caramel sweetness and resinous hop bitterness are well balanced in the finish.
-The malt flavors are truly tantalizing. This is as complex as it is satisfying for dark beer lovers. They also linger languorously in the finish. Wow.

150,"2010-07-27",3.9,"Growler shared at the 4th release of CDC. I heard lots of great things about Hill Farmstead IPAs so I was rather duprised that when I started pouring this elixir from the Growler to be greeted by a pitch black medium bodied liquid sitting beneath an average sized foamy beige head. Aroma is very toasty with notes of coffee, chocolate,earth and grassy hops. Medium bodied with good carbonation, especially from an open growler, and a lingering burnt aftertaste. Flavors of coffee beans, burnt toast and charred malts. This is one dark rosary well done beer.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
