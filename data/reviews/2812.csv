2812,"2017-04-24",3.2,"Premier bof pour moi ici. Merci. Je redescends ainsi sur Terre. Robe plus foncée presque ambrée que sa soeur Nimble. La tête est toute aussi formidable faut dire. Un nez presque mielleux, riche en trèfle et en céréales. Trop à mon goûté Je subodore un liquide lourd en bouche qui me semble peu connexe avec ce style que japprécie habituellement pour sa douceur et sa grande légèreté. Beaucoup trop de corps en bouche et volumineuse. Liquide de grande densité qui me déplaît par son mélange sucré/amer. Pas pour moi du tout.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

2812,"2016-10-20",3.8,"Draught at Armbsy Abbey, 10/6/16.Clear, straw-golden body is topped by a small, but fairly firm, white head.Biscuity and bready grains in the nose are refreshing and zesty. Lemony-herbal hops make their way in as well, and a harmonious balance is struck. Lots of sourdough, thyme/oregano character and very clean, with no alcohol. Seems quite dry from the nose, though light honey does break through signifying some remaining base malt.Well-carbonated with a big sourdough/toasted malt character that is offset somewhat by light honey and dough. Pepper, herbs, crackers and a light mineral character all tickle the palate and the beer is indeed well-attenuated and fairly well-malted. Lots of lemon, herb and maybe just a touch more bready/toasty character than Id like, but it adds a robustness to it that makes for a bit stronger flavor, which is fine depending on what mood youre in. Still plenty of refreshing qualities to it, as well.  Id like more malt suppleness/softness on the palate, as well.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
