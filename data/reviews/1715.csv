1715,"2011-04-09",2.7,"This looks like a hefe with that hazy funkiness. A lemon grass aroma. Light tart citrus flavor wit some pepper spice, caramel, and that lemongrass again.","Illinois, USA","monsterc"
1715,"2010-11-20",3.9,"Im not a huge fan of the style but holy crap was this done right. A cloudy yellow appearance with a white head. The aroma is clove, banana, peaches, bread, and clove. Same in the flavor. A holy shit awesome session beer!","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
1715,"2010-10-11",3.7,"Draft 4.5% abv per menu. My notes have murky gold white head. Banana scent. Wheat taste. Very nice Hefe! Not normally my style but really enjoyed this one!","Idaho, USA","beernovice39"
1715,"2010-09-12",3.6,"Appearance: Dispensed a clouded, dull gold body with a scant (from a rather generous pour), white head.

Smell: You get your usual hefe notes: clove-scented phenols, banana mash, whole grain wheat bread, a drop of lemon.

Taste: A sensible combination of particularly pale and ever tangy wheat malt. Spoonful of sweetish honey spiced with coriander and bit of ground pepper. Minor fruit traces of banana and candied lemon. Light hop character imparting an equally light touch of bitterness. The malts slide back into the foreground, now with more of a bready accent. Drying, wheaty, lightly spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel, while having a nice, slight creaminess to it, could benefit from some more effervescence.

Drinkability: A decent hefe, a little more crispness wouldve really given it (and me) a bit more summertime zing.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1715,"2009-12-20",3.7,"On tap from the 5 Seasons brewpub.  From my notes: gold color.  banana yeast, bubblegum and spice in the smell.  nice balanced taste.  spicy (cardamom) but good balance.  quick finish.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DialSquare"
1715,"2009-11-19",3.4,"Yellow, sticky white foam.  Aroma is spicy, banana, clove.  Taste is more banana, nice sweetness, full wheat body.","Capital of Appalachia, Pennsylvania, USA","lithy"
1715,"2009-10-03",3.7,"Tap at 5 Seasons Brewing Company. Small white head with good retention, slightly hazy body, no visible carbonation, one ring of lacing, and a golden hue with some orange tint. The aroma was sweet, wheat, yeasty, clove, bananas, some tart notes, and estery. The flavor mimicked the aroma and tasted very refreshing. A smooth mouthfeel and light-medium bodied. This is a very nicely brewed beer, easy to drink and easy on the palate. Worthy of a try and if I revisit this location, I will definitely drink this if it is available.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
1715,"2009-09-05",3.3,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a slightly hazy yellow-orange colored body. The aroma was malty and banana. The very ploesant crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and semi thiick at the finish with a mellow hoppy aftertaste. The mild flavor contained notes of malt mild hops and banana. A decent one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1715,"2009-06-15",3.8,"Tap.  Bright sunny yellow with medium cloudiness.  White creamy head.  Aroma of bananas and a touch of clove.   A nice sweet malt of wheat.  Creamy body.  Very bready.  A nice Hefe.    .04 apr 08","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
1715,"2008-04-06",3.7,"I would have to say this is my favorite out of the everyday house beers, and generally what I drink when I am in town, not including the specialties and seasonals.  Above average take on the style for a domestic craft offering and is reminiscent to me of Schneider.  Initially clove and banana notes, and I make that comparison because I think the red wheat does a lot for this beer.  Lots of cereal maltiness, with makes me say this would be a great breakfast beer.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

1715,"2007-06-24",4.4,"A nice translucent honey-golden color with a fairly thick head. Aroma is fairly strong, malty and wheaty. Flavor is typical of a hefeweizen but stronger than most I have tried - pleasantly malty/wheaty, with fruity hints and a suggestion of spice. Finish is smooth and livey. This is a refreshing and summery beer that is very pleasant to sip and enjoy.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1715,"2007-06-18",3.8,"This is dedicated to KieferUGA and kleyland for their strong love and appreciation of a good hefeweizen.  This had a really good aroma with lots of banana/bubblegum and spice; color was about right.  Flavor was much more of the same; very drinkable and one of my favorites for the style","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"

1715,"2007-02-02",3.7,"Had on tap at the brewpub in June of 2006: Pours a hazy golden bronze with a well-lacing frothy white head.  Aroma of sweet malted wheat, some bubble gum and banana along with authentic yeasty esters.  Body starts with a nice, light sweetness, some mild citrus tartness for balance and good peppery clove flavor.  Good authenticity and very drinkable.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1715,"2006-08-03",4.0,"Wow....lots of bananas and clove.  For some reason Im reminded of candied circus peanuts.  Some might call me crazy...must be the alcohol.  Great beer.","Hoon, Georgia, USA","pintocb"

1715,"2006-06-22",4.1,"On tap at the brewpub.  Nice cloudy yellow-gold pour...big hefe head.  Classic banana and spice notes in the aroma.  Crisp clovey flavor..doughy and tasty.  Nice carbonation...not overdone.  Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel.  We liked this one a lot.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
1715,"2006-06-19",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub in the ATL. Excellent brewpub Hefeweizen. Banana-ester aroma - light yellow cloudy appearance with a thick, fluffy, long lasting white head - looks delicious. Very thirst quenching. Tart lemony flavor with a nice thick mouthfeel. HInts of bubblegum - not overpowering though. Very thirst quenching - great after a long days drive on the way home from North Carolina. Fades just a bit near the end though.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1715,"2006-06-19",4.4,"What better beer than something from 5 Seasons for my 100th beer.  Big Blond HefeWeizen.  Is there a style this brewer cant do?  Nice big head in the tall hefe glass.  Strong yeast and dough.  Not too overly carbonated.  Clean wheat flavor.  I love these beers in the summer.  SLightly hazy yellow/orange.","Georgia, USA","doubleipa"

1715,"2005-09-08",3.9,"A very solid hefe and i really could not care less about hefes these dayz.  It had a banana peel look to it, very hazy.  The bananas carry over through out the entire beer in aroma and body. Some banana nut bread and peppers also.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
1715,"2005-07-18",3.7,"Draft atm.  Straw hazy yellow pour.  Big banana aroma with some cloves - very fruity.  Smooth with medium carbonation, and flavors that matched the aroma.  Slightly bitter and crisp finish.  I typically like hefeweizens that are balanced, or a little more ftuity than clovy, and this one fits that description for me.","Norcross, Georgia, USA","beeryum"
1715,"2004-09-07",4.1,"Really nice ripe banana aroma along with subtle cloves. Taste had a mellow pepper and sweet corn. I loved this stuff. Crisp & refreshing and I dont usually care for the style. Awesome.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1715,"2004-08-15",3.7,"Draft, weizen glass.  Banana, clove aromas are dominant.  Hint of spicy hops and breadish malt background.  Deep gold-amber body that is appropriately hazy.  Moderately sweet, moderatley acidic flavor becomes a lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter finish.  Slight wheat tang in the flavor.  Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: tastes almost like the homebrew hefeweizen I just made!  In other words, I like it!","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
1715,"2004-08-01",3.7,"A muted version of most bavarian hefeweizens. Smooth and golden. Frothy velvety head. Nose is slightly weak. Not very bubblegummy. Flavours are magnificent. Adapts well to a lemon. Touch of bubblegum on the end. Good brew.

1715,"2003-08-16",3.7,"This is a fairly dark for the style. It's along the lines of the Schneider Weisse. I was a little disappointed with the lack of head. Its seems wrong that a hefeweizen doesnt have a huge, fluffy head, but this one didnt. Maybe I just got a bad pour. The aroma is nice, very estery. Good bubblegum, but the cloves were dominant in this one. I prefer it the other way around, but Im not complaining, since this was a fairly bold hefeweizen. The flavor was good with a nice balance. It had a good creamy mouth feel that the good hefes usually have. With the exception of the headlessness, this was a great example of what a good hefeweizen is.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
