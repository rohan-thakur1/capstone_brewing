3604,"2017-05-04",3.2,"Fruity and somehow spicy aroma of cedar and citrus with hints of bread, nuts and caramel: not explosive but really well balanced. Clean golden color with an oversized (if you consider were talking about a best bitter) white long lasting foam. Just the same as the aroma at the palate but with some ""woodiness"" added. Medium-high carbonation. Medium bitterness. Its surely not an english best bitter as we all are used to know it, Id classify it as a golden ale instead. The 33 cl bottle is definitely too small for this session ale which needs to be drinken in a bigger size: you start loving it only when its over by now.","ITALY","Vinx"

Hazy golden with nice white head and lacing.  Peach and other light fruits, pale malt, and floral hoppy notes on the nose.  The flavor is great and balanced, with a light pale malt base and great floral, fruity, and earthy hop flavors balancing it out.  The bitterness level is spot-on for the style.  Clean and crisp on the palate with a good level of carbonation.  This is a great and very drinkable bitter, coming from an American who barely knows the style, this being my 12th Bitter tick.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
