Smell: Wow this is a nice complex one....vanilla, coffee, roast malt, caramel, a hint of spicy hops.

Taste: Take the nose and simply amplify it! Really well put together flavor profile hear. The slight touch of hops and the coffee note keep the vanilla and the caramel malt from being too sweet. They simply blend SEEMLESSLY!!!!

Mouthfeel: Fairly standard medium body with just enough carbonation. A touch thin if anything but Im being really nit picky when I say that.

Drinkability: Low abv + medium body + delicious flavor = really drinkable brew!

Aroma starts with a big hit of vanilla, a whole lot of it, with notes of roasted malts, brown sugar, and caramel.  Very sweet smell that mellows as the glass goes down.  I loved it.  The flavor is no surprise after the aroma, plenty of vanilla, with roasted malts, brown sugar, and caramel, as well as some of the tobacco, nutty, and earthy notes that are much more noticeable in the regular Maduro.  The body on this is way too thin and watery, though; with some carbonation and a thicker body, this could have been awesome.  As it stands, the flavor starts with a punch of vanilla, gets progressively roastier, and then dies quickly and weakly because of the thin body.  This could be because I had a growler shipped to me and it lost a little, but I drank it as quickly as I could after receiving it.  Still a pretty cool beer, and I love vanilla and barrel-aged beers, so its right up my alley.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

2001,"2009-07-16",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2009 32oz growler shared by kp at the Brick Store, tasted side-by-side with the Espresso Maduro.

Pours a deep, clear copper brown with a short-lived bubbly tan head that recedes to a small ring leaving very little lacing.

The aroma is much sweeter than the original Maduro and the vanilla really shines through in tandem with the underlying caramel malts.  The hops are less prevalent than in the original as well, but the signature tobacco aroma can still be detected in the nose.

The taste is close to the aroma and starts out very sweet with the vanilla, caramel and chocolate carrying the front of the taste.  There is a toasted malt backbone that shows through in the middle, though the sweetness has overrun it a bit and the finish is slightly dry with the tobacco and some nuts coming out.

The mouthfeel is very smooth with low carbonation, probably due to the growler.  Its fairly full bodied.

This is another solid offering from CCB though I probably prefer the original Maduro to this one.  Its definitely sweeter and less roasty, but this coffee-lover prefers the espresso version in the head-to-head as well.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

The flavor follows suit with the caramel and chocolate coming through and then quickly followed by the vanilla beans and marshmellows.

Poured clear, garnety-brown with a loose-bubbled cap of beige head.. color and clarity were great, and Ill attribute the slight lack of carbo to the bottle.  The aroma picked up syrupy caramel, molasses, and nutty notes accented by a serious dose of sweet, fresh vanilla bean.. the vanilla was the dominant character with warmth, and it helped create a very desserty impression.  The flavor was almost entirely about the vanilla with a fresh, beany character.. aged caramel, toasted grains, and a pinch of sweeter chocolate at the core.. finished long with more of the vanilla.  Very sweet on the palate with light-to medium body to it.. carbonation was light (again the bottle probably had something to do with it).. balance was quite solid.

Slightly watery body but it is a brown ale after all so I cant fault that, toasted almonds ands light chocolate up front with a soft caramel backbone, big juicy vanilla notes towards the end and a light bitterness to keep everything in balance.

A small, tight head of khaki colored foam leaves wet, jagged lines and micro-spots of lacing behind on the glass.  The nose is sweeter than the other versions of Maduro that I have tried, the vanilla lending a sort of ""root beer"" like feel to the underlying caramel and cocoa malt, with subtle hints of brown sugar glazed nuts.   Flavors follow suit, considerably less roasty than the other versions, sweet from the vanilla and dark caramel.  The chocolate component also seems to be subdued, overpowered by notes of toasted marshmallow, vanilla, and powdered sugar.  Just a hint of roasted coffee hits the back of the throat.  Medium bodied and smooth, the perceived sweetness makes this one just a shade less sessionable than its brethren, but it still feels nice on the tongue.

The aroma is sweet with malts, vanilla and a dash of caramel. Overall the aroma is moderate in strength and is able to bend the will of the drinker to go ahead and take a sip even if youre not ready. The taste is much roastier then the nose and is tempered by the smooth near creamy oatmeal-ness. It begins with mild vanilla and caramel notes before layers upon layer of roast to dark roastiness take over. The vanilla persists in the background and build some into the finish.
