1625,"2015-04-12",2.6,"Bottle shared by AJax. Clear gold, no head.mthis is my first ever Sake rating. Never been a fan and it maybe the only one I ever rate. Aroma is stale rice and alcohol. 
The flavor is nearly as bad as the aroma. Really bad moldy stale bread mixed with alcohol. Pretty huge warming after he sip. The flavor is not a pleasant thing.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
1625,"2015-04-12",2.9,"$17 at local Co-Op. Sediment, very light yellow. Slight rubbing alcohol, floral notes, dry honey. Not a very good Sake. Sweet, a moldy rotten taste, old grapes. yeah, pretty dry with a lingering peanut, pistachio finish.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
1625,"2012-04-11",3.4,"bottle from azwine 4/11/12.

slightly off clear shade of yellow. no real leggings at 38 degrees.

it smells of powdered sugar, umami, fennel bulb, mango, over ripe cantaloupe and baby powder.

it doesnt taste as good as it smells... powdered sugar, rice, florals and a touch of alcohol. light tartness on the finish. the AT is faintly of fennel bulb.

tiny bit of sweetness but it is not sticky, oily or thick. 8/3/6/3/14","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"
1625,"2012-01-22",1.3,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is very light yellow. Aroma is a strong note of fusel alcohol (diesel fuel, jet fuel, bug spray e.g. malathion), other notes of plant fertilizer, mold, and random chemicals. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter, unclean. Medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.  This is easily the #1 most fusel beverage I have ever encountered...its positively shocking how bad this is.  How is this even able to sell?  Bad bottle/batch?  Unbelievably horrific.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1625,"2009-07-14",2.5,"Off white color.  Aroma of moldy rice, grain silo and alcohol.  Muddled rice and grain flavors.  Old, composting flowers.  Dry finish.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1625,"2009-06-20",3.1,"Melon and fennel with a hint of chocolate on the nose.  Pours clear.  White chocolate flavors, with alcohol, melon, and a very clean finish.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
1625,"2008-12-08",3.0,"A drier sake, with a fruity orange like aroma.  Not as vibrant, rich and complex as Id like but still clean.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
1625,"2008-06-26",3.9,"This bottle sake from Indianapolis, IN poured from a beautiful crystal blue bottle.  The body was clear with a yellow hue and fully diminished bubbles except for a few medium sized air pockets on top.  It has a nice polished rice aroma.  The mouth feel had a slight buttery note to its vinous alcohol burn in the aftertaste.  The flavor was of vinous polished rice with a smooth alcohol note.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1625,"2008-04-11",3.2,"300ml. Pours a light bright gold with decent drippy legs. Faint tropical fruit, melon mustiness, a touch of rice and some alcohol on the nose. Light mouthfeel with a pleasant coconut oiliness. Melon, rice, butter with a lingering oily alcohol hotness on the finish.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
1625,"2008-01-22",3.3,"Bottle chilled from Sams Chicago. Poured clear color with legs. Moderate coconut, melon and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a medium smooth dry texture. Moderate  sweet melon flavor with a light sweet alcohol burn finish of moderate duration. I would recommend this to a freind.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1625,"2007-07-22",3.3,"Alcohol and rice sugar on the nose.  Sweet sake taste with fruit hints and a dry mouthfeel.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
1625,"2007-06-21",3.2,"Alcohol in the nose. Clear and beige. Sweetish, but not what I would call sweet. Similar whiskey taste. Its burn is apparent only in the aftertaste. Very light. Not grainy. Hate the mouthfeel. Good ginjo.","Dothan, Alabama, USA","Rictus"
1625,"2006-12-05",3.5,"300mL: A beigeish looking sake with decent legs. Nose of husky koji and a bit of sharp yeast and alcohol. No umami. Lightly buttery. The flavor is fairly neutral, light alcohol, decent umami. The nose doesnt do anything for me but the flavor is nice. Its funny that austinpowers mentioned niigata, I was thinking this had the same characteristics of a niigata sake but without the overall complexity. My first tottori sake, so who knows.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1625,"2005-05-04",3.5,"oil looking clear, like the oil from a can of tuna. aroma is of light plums with a grape note.plus the requisite alcohol. taste some almonds,and alcohol but all kind of dulled. with a light alcohol flavor. nutty finish, nice palate overall.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
1625,"2004-01-23",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2004 Nice.  Lightest-possible yellowish tinge.  This Mantensei is pricier than the Tentaka Kuni, but Star-Filled Sky's quality shows through when you taste how light and smooth it is.  There is not the alcohol burn you might get with a simple Tokubetsu.  Its weakness is that the nose reeks of alcohol (along with a pleasant perfume aroma).  The taste is lightly neutral (neither sweet nor dry) with a honeyish quality.  The butteriness is light, though present.  Enjoyable and typical of a Ginjo in that there's a detectable alcohol burn, but it's not overpowering.  Not quite as good as Hakkaisan's Junmai Ginjo, perhaps because Hakkaisan is from the famed Niigata Prefecture.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
