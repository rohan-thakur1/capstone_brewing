1578,"2015-04-08",5.0,"Maybe the cloudiest Nigori I have seen yet. Nice a creamy, yellowish (or maybe thats my kitchen lighting). Nice and gritty, and strong. Whoa now!","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
1578,"2014-11-17",3.5,"Cloudy milk color. Rice, fruity, and some vanilla. Would never have guessed 20%+ ...","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1578,"2013-09-19",3.4,"Bottle. Pours milky white. Melon, coconut, rice, medium sweetness, and light booziness. Pretty good.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
1578,"2013-06-26",3.5,"From a bottle at Japan in Epcot this sake poured a thick, milky and white with great tearing. The aroma was sweetish rice, vodka and a touch of vanilla. The flavor was boozy and bitey with notes of vanilla, cream, rice, vodka, lemon and a vague floral presence. Long grainy rice, vodka and vanilla finish. Medium body. Nice.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
1578,"2012-07-04",3.7,"Bottle shared with the vuong family while in Seattle July, 2012. Pours a creamy, milky white body with thin gritty, powdery white lacing. Aroma is milk, body odor, almonds and light booze. Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied with notes of milk, almonds, light fruity booze, coconut, and a light graininess towards the finish. One of the better, more interesting sakes Ive had thus far.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1578,"2010-06-25",3.9,"300mL Bottle of Murai Family Nigori Genshu at Kabuki - Wakefield, RI. Creamy nose, with dense plum, pear, and grain. Pours intensely milky with a broken skim of alcohol and ice. Flavors are rich and deep, well-balanced I think. Theres cucumber, rose petals, coconut, cream, and almond milk. Rich and textured. The heavier alcohols (bottle says 19.9%) really arent overbearing and mingle well with the higher level of sweetness, creating deliciously sippable balance. A nice example, in my opinion.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1578,"2009-10-07",3.6,"Bottle...  Poured an off-white, almost gray.  Very cloudy and murky looking.  Aroma of candy sugars, creamy vanilla.  Tasted very sweet, with a mild alcohol burn, almond, and overall coconut quality.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
1578,"2009-02-23",3.6,"300ml bottle. Pours a milky dark white and leaves lots of debris on the sides of the glass. Aroma is big vanilla and hints of coconut. Thick milky taste with slightly sweet vanilla and coconut hush. Very smooth but the high abv peaks through just a little. Delicious and deceptively strong, might be a tad too sweet.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1578,"2009-01-15",2.0,"The Murai Family extends its pedigree to a Nigori Genshu - a much sweeter sake than any of the other Murai sakes Ive seen - obviously a product of the style.  Predictably the sake is a smooth, milky ribbon, clouded with rice lees, and barely a whisper of sweet, ricey aroma.  I waste no time and move into the sip, a slight sweetness encroaching on the tip of my tongue and exhibiting peach and mandarin orange flavors.  The palate is incredibly thick and chalky, coating the whole tongue like a tasty, alcoholic stomach relief medicine.  I then take my second sip, and find that the Nigori Genshu has changed dramatically into a barnyard flavor, its flavor shockingly reminiscent of fresh manure and a second stage of scorching, alcohol burning all the way down my gullet.  I try to re-evaluate that barnyard taste, in a way what I thought Brettanomyces was supposed to taste, but cant really come up with any apt description except for manure and maybe even dog food.  Its not gag reflex worthy, but I definitely dont care for it, and almost find myself committing a rare drain pour, but remind myself of the price per ounce and force it down, vainly hoping to find some subtler, meritable flavor.  Nai.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1578,"2008-12-12",3.3,"Bottled labeled as Murai Family Nigori Genshu, 19.9% ABV.  Ultra-cloudy and dense looking, the milky body shows dirty white, almost like the color of Uncle Bens instant rice.  Sugary legging shows on the glass.  Aromas include sweet cream, confectioners sugar, coconut, rice pudding, and hints of limoncello.  Flavors follow suit, sweet and creamy, with notes of rice, tapioca, coconut, and lemon.  Thick and sugary on the palate, a rough graininess leads into a semi-dry finish with an alcoholic burn.  Not bad as Nigoris go, but ultimately too sweet for my tastes.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1578,"2008-04-20",3.6,"This was the Murai Family Nigori Genshu , unfilltered sake. Tasted strongly of alcohol, which makes sense at 20.5% abv. Nose is of alcohol and horchata. Strongly alcohol and sweetness. Alcohol and caramel, some coconut and rice on the tongue. Very rich and interesting.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1578,"2007-11-12",3.6,"Murai Family chilled bottle from Party Source. Poured cloudy white pour with sticky legs. Moderate coconut and melons aroma. Medium body with a creamy texture. Medium pineapple, vanilla and coconut rice flavor with a medium creamy sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations were met with a smooth complex sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1578,"2006-08-08",3.5,"Tasted at Momokawa Tasting hosted by Sake One: Milky white, small grain size on the glass. Nose of alcohol, grain, coconut and durrian (?!). Flavor is lightly sweet, sticky, thick, huge alcohol but not too sweet. Decent melon and banana notes as well. Would get the job done right, and not TOO sweet, because of all that alcohol it needs to cover up, but comes across much better than some nigori genshus.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
