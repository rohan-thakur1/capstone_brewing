4007,"2017-06-19",4.0,"12 oz bottle poured. Quite a big beer here. Unexpected, and didnt even realize it when I picked it up. Very dark, muddy brown pour with a ton of foam head and lacing. Toast constant aroma here, with a hop addition that Ive never seen anywhere else. Extremely thick, creamy body to this. A ton of roasted malt that seems overpowering at first, but it seems just right after this sits for a minute. A toasty front, bitter hops all throughout, and a chocolate heavy linger late. Very interesting beer here. A one of a kind for sure. With the heavy roasted malt and chocolate flavors here, I didnt think Id be able to pick out the hops, but they are very much present here. Just your classic Imperial Cascadian India Dark Hemp Pale Ale here. Turns out, I love ICIDHPAs.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

4007,"2017-03-15",3.6,"Very bold double ipa that pours pretty & smells great but Im not getting the black aspect. Dark pour w/ a beige head & plenty of lacing. The aroma contains an abundance of hops w/ some dark malt sprinkled in. The taste is overrun w/ the hop presence as the darker malts are barely present to ever so slightly knock some of the bigterness down.

4007,"2017-01-05",4.5,"Super sweet, nutty, and chocolate forward black ipa. It smells and tastes like a gigantic, delicious imperial stout but has a nice amount of citrus hoppiness that cuts through it. Its not as in your face as stone enjoy bys black ipa which was pretty much a citrus bomb but its really delicious and an interesting take. The roastiness and chocolate are much more predominate than the citrus but its still absolutely delicious. Theres a nice nuttiness also which is a really pleasant touch.

Outstanding combination, outstanding beer!!!

Aroma is fresh hops with a bit of a doobie character, roast malt, Flavors somewhat similar to nose, plus quite dry (except in finish - then a hint of sweet comes out), very bitter, some tang. Body is good though the extreme bitter coupled with alcohol warmth yields a strange tingle, while still being oddly smooth. Big beer.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
4007,"2015-03-11",3.6,"2015 bottle. Pours a vary dark brown with a foamy tan head and sticky lacing. Aroma is bright herbal hops on a bed of earthy sweet malt.

Nothing black is tasted yet (55.4F). At 59F some cocoa finally pops up and it becomes more earthy, too. This is very tasty and the hops are nicely balanced by the malts. Bitterness is very mild.

4007,"2014-08-26",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 2-10-13-
 Poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance- Pours a deep brown color with a one half finger tan colored head. The head fades over a three minute time period to leave a moderate of lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is very nice. It is a great combination of some darker, sweeter and hoppier smells. The darker aromas are of a roasted malt and strong chocolate smell and the sweet are a mix of tangerine and caramel with some candied sugar smells. The hop rounds out these sweeter and darker aromas well, with it being biggest of a citrus grapefruit with a nice blend of herbal and earthy hop mixed within.

 Taste  The taste begins with roasted malt and a lighter caramel and sweeter citrus taste. As the taste advances the sweeter flavors fade with some coffee coming to the tongue as well as some hoppy tastes of a grapefruit and earthy nature. These flavors take to the taste to its end where the citrus hop gets stronger in nature and is joined by some herbal tastes. Along with the hop flavors that come at the end so too does a semi-sweet chocolate flavor which in the end, when combined with the rest, leaves a bitter roasted flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The creaminess and thickness of the brew is on the slightly lighter side for an imperial IPA with a carbonation level that is average for a normal brew, but a tad too high for an imperial. A lower carbonation level and a thicker body would likely have been nicer for the darker flavors and abv of the brew by really giving the hoppy tastes a chance to permeate the tongue.

 Overall  The aroma of the beer and the flavors up to the very end of the taste were fantastic. The weaker mouthfeel and somewhat unbalanced end/aftertaste of the brew hinder it from being a truly great brew though. Regardless of this it is a tasty beer and well worth a try.","","Darkmagus82"

4007,"2014-08-14",3.9,"Great blend of hop aromas come through on the nose of this ebony ale. Legs to match the drapes, this brew boasts a toffee head that clings to reveal the ABV if you didn't read it already.

Robust, roasted malts come through first with abundant hop bitterness to follow with multiple layers of complexity that play out well after taking a sip. Full bodied palate matches appropriately and also hides a bit of the alcohol content here.

While this brew might benefit from a little work on balance (not really necessary in an imperial anything) the layers and alternating smoothness, bitterness and sweet roasted malts deliver interest for miles.

The taste is fresh with clear hints of hops that is well balanced against a base of roasted malt. This is not a sprawling explosion of flavors, but a well-balanced composition of hops and roasted malt. I do not know what the ""hemp seeds"" is giving to the taste but perhaps they can be found somewhere. In the finish there is a distinct but not intrusive bitter taste of grapefruit. A very refreshing and dangerously easy to drink beer, to take account of the 9.2% ABV. Highly recommended!","SWEDEN","BeerSkull"

4007,"2014-05-17",4.0,"More notes have been found and heres my take on this awesome brew.
The day I had this, I poured this into a pint glass.
The appearance was a nice pure black color with a one finger white foamy head that ends up holding its own as far as trying to settle out. I believe this head must last for almost the entire beer. The lacing was clingy and somewhat thick.
The smell had roasted coffee notes coming through in a malted chocolate sort of way.
The taste was sweet, roasty and bitter at different times that ends up leading into a dry bitter roasty finish.
On the palate, it sat about at a medium and tries to show a decent sessionable aspect but probably because of the high ABV, it ends up being more of a sipper. The carbonation shows enough harshness for the black ale style and still shows a decent smoothness running about my mouth and tongue.
Overall, Im glad I found the notes on this today and right now am wishing Uinta distributed to Alaska as I would love to try more of their brews.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Alcohol is only present as a warming factor but does not intrude on the flavor.  At first the flavor comes across as an above average IPA with nice floral and piney hops and then there is a roasted coffee-like malt component.  One of the few of this style where this dynamic enhances everything rather than coming across as 2 styles mixed together for no purpose.  Dry throughout.  Quite drinkable too.

Its definitely a bigger IPA than most, hence the imperial label. As this beer warms, the roasted, chocolate notes come through even more, which is fine with me!

Another Utah tick compliments of Santa, this beer has been living in the fridge for the past two months while I make room. Cracking it open I was greeted to a solid and above average beer that strives for balance instead of just smashing you over the head with Hops Hops Hops!

Aroma / Appearance - The deep opaque ruby base absorbs almost all ambient light. Weathered strips of newspaper grace the top. Malt balls, chocolate powder, and a sharp hop bite play against each other as the malt bill competes for attention.

4007,"2012-09-14",4.0,"A steady pour into my Bruery tulip produces an almost two finger thick, lightly brown head that leaves some light lacing as it subsides. The beer is a concentrated brown color that shows a brilliantly clear, dark ruby hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of savory browned whole grain, lots of nutty hemp notes, and a bright, candied berry and citrus character from an ample hopping. Soft aromas of woody pine, rosemary, hints of menthol, and lots of woody herbal notes are noticeable as well.

Somewhat creamy textured with enough sweetness to accentuate a ripe, hop-laden fruit character; this is offset by a nutty / herbal hemp note, a smooth bitterness, a woody herbal and pine like character and some lightly prickly carbonation. A lingering roasted malt character subtly influences the long finish; the nutty character is likely influenced by the hemp, as well as by the dark malt character. Soft savory notes from the dark malt character are accentuated by the nutty hemp notes. All the flavors here seem to be supporting notes for the balance whole; other specific individual components of tangerine zest, floral citrus blossoms, kumquat, lychee, espresso, smoothly burnt brown bread, nutty / spicy whole grain, and roasted caramel notes.

I have had a few of these over that past couple weeks, it is good enough that I keep on just drinking them instead of rating it. I have a visceral reaction to this beer that has me just sitting here and enjoying this beer quite a bit more than I perhaps would when adding up the individual components of this beer; though in truth, even those are quite tasty. The mix of hemp seeds and hop character works really well with the dark malt character; I like that the dark malt character only contributes a touch of roast character, as well as hints of nutty, brown grain like character that just boosts the complexity that much more. A thoroughly enjoyable beer that I am happy to drink quite a bit of. The aroma is a bit better balanced and characterful than the flavor, but this is fairly nice as well.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4007,"2012-08-25",4.2,"12 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass.

A: Pours a not-quite-black dark burgundy color. The head is a two finger light tan color with great texture and nice retention. A lot of thin, filmy lace is left on the glass, having that could almost pass for a black metal bands logo vibe to it.

S: Surprisingly citrusy - I was expecting more of a floral/pine hop quality, but I really cant complain here. A decent amount of papaya, mango, and apricots form the main aspects of the aroma, with just a backing hint of roasted malt and chocolate. I also sense a little bit of marijuana, too.

T: Again, I really like how citrusy this is, but the black ale qualities are subtle, at best. An opening salvo of mango and papaya give way to a finish of light roast and hemp. The darker malts only serve to smooth out the hop profile without creating a clashing sensation problematic of a lot of black ales. Smoothly balanced with minimal to moderate bitterness and a building roasted aftertaste. Nothing hyper complex, but son of a bitch, this just works. 

M: Silky smooth to start, before the hops create a coarseness after the midtaste. Hop oils build a resinous texture on the tongue without destroying the palate. Not easy to drink, due to the thicker body, but the finishing dryness and moderate carbonation makes this easy to sip.

O: I love DIPAs and I love stouts, but hybridize the two into a black ale and the results can be questionable at times (see: Stone SSR). This, on the other hand, is an example of the style done right. VERY well priced for what it is, and highly recommended. Even at three months old, this is damn good stuff.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

The mouthfeel is soft, with a medium-body and just a hint of carbonation.  It finishes smooth and creamy but then you are struck with a resiny hop aftertaste that dries out the mouth.

Overall I think this beer is serviceable.  I think I was hoping for a little more body and a little more malt support from an imperial.  If all you want is hops and hops, then this is probably worth a try.","New York, USA","yankeefan21"

Feeling rather dry, both torrefied and hoppy in mouth, which rhymes with a strong bitterness that cleanses the palate out. The burnt grain character feels a bit exotic, but surprisingly not all that thick for a 9%+ ale. A bit straightforward in fact and not particularly captivating in the hop department, but perhaps that is due to subpar freshness?

The malts are huge, providing a enormous wave of chocolate and toffee, countering the lingering, bitter, venomous hop streak that lines every molecule of the brew.  A little too boozy for comfort-- Im feeling every point of that ABV.   Also, Im not sure why theyd use hemp seed--  not the tastiest ingredient of all time, so Im guessing its raison detre is for the wink-wink drug reference.  Clever.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
4007,"2012-07-10",4.2,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Opaque black body, forms a rather large, brownish, creamy head. It does dissolve a little quicker than Id prefer, but not completely and leaves decent lacing on the glass.

Smell: Big grapefruit and general citrus aroma with an underlying confectionery sweetness. 

Taste: It seems like everyone is brewing a black IPA these days, some stronger than others, but what separates Uinta Dubhe Imperial Black IPA from the pack is the fact its brewed with hemp seed. This helps to accentuate the earthy/resiny/piney characteristics of the hops. And this certainly is a hop bomb with strong, dank bitterness immediately. As it changes to the second half a sharp, somewhat astringent quality appears momentarily, but then quickly fades away (Im assuming this is from the hemp seed). The finish is mostly the same as the beginning, but with an additional malty sweetness. Its more akin to a porter than a stout, which is a little odd considering how big the beer is.

And while the hops certainly are the main attraction here, theres still a noticeable sweetness to the palate. After a few swigs the beginning starts to seem sweeter with dark chocolate and coffee creamer flavors. Maybe a hint of caramel, too, and the aftertaste also has these flavors. Its a very appealing palate and the complete lack of alcohol taste or warmth makes it all the more impressive. Had they left the hemp out itd be a perfect beer as that astringency is a tad distracting, but easily tolerated.

Drinkability: Youd never know this beer was 9.2% ABV if it werent on the label. It has the body and weight of something half its size. The mouthfeel is soft, full-bodied for sure, but isnt sticky and chewy like many imperial IPAs often are. The texture is velvety and creamy and it slides across the tongue and down the throat with ease. The only caveat is the hops do linger, leaving an almost cloying resiny film on the tongue and drying out the mouth. Paired with a robust meal or as a liquid dessert is the best way to drink this beer.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Appearance: Pours out a matte black body with a lightly foamy, lightly hued beige head.

Taste: Bitter chocolate coated roast with some slight ashtray qualities. Low sweetness thats altogether brief. Hard-handed resins, powdered pith, discarded lawn weeds, and coagulated, gloopy pine resins. High bitterness.

Pours dark brown with red highlights under light with a two finger creamy light brown head that leaves nice rings of sticky, drippy lacing.  Purty.

Aroma has a very deep fresh hop nose to it with strong grapefruit, solid pine, light peppery spiciness, strong toasted malt presence with some light burnt notes late. Flavor has a strong hoppiness to it but its very well balanced as no one flavor dominates the beer. Early flavor profile contains a strong hop bitterness composed of a pine and grapefruit kick but this quickly is brought down by a smooth toasted malt presence. I pick up some light peppery spiciness in the flavor, light burnt acidity and a fair amount of alcohol at the end. The alcohol finish, in my opinion, seems to accentuate the malt character, really makes it pop. Palate is fantastic, smooth with some creaminess and the low, fine alcohol really deliver the hop aroma slowly. Overall a great beer.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

Solid roastiness with some hop resins, earth, and a light licorice spice. Flavor is bigger chocolate malts and resiny, juicy citrus pines up front.

Thick and foamy tan head on top of what looks like a black beer, but under a bright light is a beautiful deep garnet.   At first it seems like this is going to be a typical barleywine after all because of the initial sweetness and alcohol bite.  However, it quickly shows that its not with a strong, smoky, dry charred wood flavor followed by both milk and dark chocolate.  Then the deep, earthy, pungent hop flavor comes through and muddles the initial sweetness in a really great way.  All of these things combined create a lingering burnt/chocolate finish with a slight soy sauce taste.  The tongue is coated in bitter hops and bittersweet chocolate.  Imperial black IPA?   Yep, thats exactly what this is and its really good.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

Overall I did come to the conclusion that Black IPAs have a small;l window of impression.  this had some lovely roasted sweet dark malts that were complimented with a light to moderate roastiness.  The serious amount of alcohol did not sneak up and smack you in the head but was more like an old firend ambling up next to you at the bar.  Hops do come out of the woodwork for brief intervals but leave you there and go for a smoke and then return for some cheerful banter.

4007,"2011-11-11",3.8,"12 ounce bottle. Bottled on date: 5/27/11. Drank 11/11/11.

AROMA: Citrusy hops, roast, toffee. Faint chocolate. Extremely subtle vegetation aroma. Interesting herbal candy-like note that is faint. 

TASTE: Resinous hops are more pronounced than roasted malt. Some citrusy and grassy character to the hops. Roast is quite heavy on the palate. Mildly sweet (behind all the hop and roast bitterness).

MOUTH FEEL: Lively carbonation for the strength; which seems to make the hoppiness feel a bit more prickly. Nice puckering bitterness with a bit of the hop oil feel shining through. Semi-dry. 

OVERALL: Yes, a bit dated for a black IPA, however, I remember thinking very highly of this beer on tap, especially against others in the Black IPA/Imperial Black IPA style so bought this despite being almost 6 months since bottling. 

Excellent beer in a great style category. Complex. Unable to say its velvety like some imperial stouts though the hop bite is excellent.

The hemp wasnt very noticeable. It was sort of like a gimmick beer that really doesnt need a gimmick, cause its very good.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a very dark red that was basically black in the glass with and average, tan head that left excellent lacing. The aroma had moderate to heavy roasted malt and caramel; a little chocolate and coffee; moderate herbal, piney and almost minty hops; slightly less citrus hops; slight cherry; tobacco; licorice; and cola. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, light to moderately bitter and slightly acidic; while the finish was moderately sweet, moderate to heavily bitter and lightly acidic with a fairly long duration. There was roasted malt, coffee, some chocolate, some cherry, tobacco, heavy tobacco, pine hops, herbal notes, a little toasted malt, burnt malt, slight herbal notes blending with pine hops and some citrus hops.

4007,"2011-10-21",4.0,"I went to college at the University of Utah (Class of 01), and at that time Utahs microbrew renaissance was really getting its sea legs.  The local scene was dominated by Uinta, Wasatch and, to a lesser extent, Squatters.  Wasatch had the best labels, Squatters had the best pub, and Uinta had the best beer.  Nowadays Im on the East Coast and was surprised to find a Uinta product on tap at one of our citys better beer bars, very pleasantly surprised as it turned out.  This is a complex, yet balanced beer.  The 9.2% ABV makes it strong, but its not overwhelming.  A great beer for an Indian Summer--hoppy to quench your thirst but warming for when the Sun goes down.","USA","lawdogg"

Was very much surprised that I didnt hate this one. The roasted malts were restrained to a point that they did not interfere negatively with the fruity and floral hops. I only picked up the faintest of roast and cocoa in the malt profile with mostly the citrus, pine, and floral hops showing their colors. The higher abv., I believe, ads to its roundness and overall drinkability as it tones down the harsh hop plus harsh roasted malt profile.  Good stuff, here.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"

4007,"2011-09-09",3.5,"Poured into a snifter.

5.0 A: Black color. Nearly three fingers of creamy, tan head. Retention is very good and tons of lacing. Well done here.

4.5 S: Well they certainly put some hops in this. This smells more like a regular DIPA with the black part being subtle. Floral, piney, citrusy, and even a bit herbal. The malts below give a hint of coffee and an even smaller hint of chocolate.

3.5 T: Like usual, the hops and the dark malts butt heads. Roastiness lends a bitterness that is exacerbated by the bittering hops. The roastiness itself is in fisticuffs with the pine and citrus notes though this beer puts them together slightly better than most. Herbalness is out of place all together. Chocolate hits on the tail end.

3.5 M: Medium to heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation and a pleasant creaminess. Bitter, roasty aftertaste is a bit off-putting though.

3.0 D: Despite my efforts, Ive only found one black IPA that integrates the roast and the hops well. This isnt it, unfortunately. Flavors fighting each other is too dangerous for this to continue.

Flavor is at first, fleetingly, dark roasted malt, followed almost immediately by a mouthful of bitterness and pine, a flash of alcohol warmth, and then back to malty sweet, and ending with lasting bitterness.  The generous amount of hops primarily contribute bitterness, while their piney flavor battles the heavy malt, but this is a tasty beer nonetheless.

4007,"2011-07-06",3.7,"Bottle from Sams in Durham. Pours almost black, with a beige, slightly pink-tinted head that sticks around and offers nice lacing. Nose is lots o hops. I guess the five varieties of hops make for such a well-balanced hop profile. Citrus, fruit, resin, but nothing overpowering. Also well-integrated with chocolate-y malts. I havent been into hoppy beers recently--much less black IPAs--but this is tasting great. Palate a bit thin, but not much else to complain about.  I likes.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
4007,"2011-07-05",4.0,"The pour is nearly black with deep garnet highlights and a khaki, creamy, moderately full head which i s mostly lasting and leaves tight, sporadic lace.  The nose is nice with pink grapefruit/passionfruit citrus, resinous pine, slight licorice, bready almost cake-like notes, light spice, and toasted caramel.  The flavor is the same; similar grapefruit and faint passionfruit, some chocolate cake, resinous pine, light rustic, very faint licorice, and just a bit of caramel.  The palate is moderately full, less than lively, coating, and creamy.  The beer finishes with a moderately high bitterness, still resinous, some spice again, and a faint caramel background.  Actually just about what I like in this style and certainly incredibly drinkable.  Did not taste the hemp.  Not sure why it does not have respect of similar beers?","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

4007,"2011-06-29",3.8,"Soil and charred oak nose, traces of soy sauce, slightly savory. Clear mahogany, thin tan head, nice lacing. Flavor is mulberry, but quickly gives way to umami, oak, and roast beef. Its earthy with healthy amounts of moss, dirt, and twigs. Finishes bitter with char and plum skins. Alcohol content is suprisingly not evident.  Medium body, extreme complexity. This is neat on paper but extremely disjointed. I appreciate the thought that went into it, but its hard to enjoy. It just lacks the gestalt of equally complex beers like the trappist quads or a well made imperial stout.  I think this is an acquired taste, but I could learn to like it.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
4007,"2011-06-29",3.6,"12oz bottle from Sams, Durham. Heavy, almost oily near-black pour with a medium tan head. Sharp hops and licorice in the nose, tilted slightly in favor of the latter. Full mouthfeel, a good deal lighter than the look would suggest. Flavors are potent, with some smoke, chocolate, and wood blending with the aforementioned licorice. Hoppy, sure, but this is more like a spiced black ale to me than a black IPA. Thats fine, though, as its a fairly enjoyable beer regardless of nomenclature.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

4007,"2011-06-10",3.3,"Pours a dark orangey-brown but sits nearly black in the glass. Tan head takes a while to develop through the thick liquid but it puffs up to a solid three fingers before melting away to leave thick fine-bubbled lacing. First impression is that this smells like a hoppy barleywine. Lots of grapefruity hops and a toasty caramel maltiness. As it warms, more chocolate comes through, but this is a hoppy beast, even at three months old. Flavor has some smooth dark-but-not-super-dark chocolate and pineapple hops to go with a very bitter finish. Ashy tobacco notes recall cheap cigars and theres a big fusel presence. The label says the malts ""align"" with the hops but I find the flavor profile to be discordant. Palate is nice and silky while the beer is cool, but some warmth thins it out and shows more alcohol.

Palate is good and masks the alcohol completely. Lots of roast and mocha is in the flavor with a really dry finish.

4007,"2011-04-26",3.2,"12oz bottle poured into a Bruery tulip. Black with a medium-sized tan head that has pretty good retention for a beer this big. The aroma is a muddled mix of hops, alcohol, and roasted malt. Piney hops stand out, with a touch of orange jam. Then there is a good dose of try, toasty, and ashy black malt. A somewhat bright and round fruitiness ties it all together. The flavor is dry and boozy but not to the point of being harsh. Very bitter, dry, and roasty in the finish. Resiny hop flavor gets through the dry roastiness, but there is no confusing this with a double IPA. I feel like this needs more sweetness or more hop flavor for better balance, or just less black malt character, but thats getting into a more general preference for the style. Im not a big fan of any dark malt flavor in black IPAs, so consider that. The way things are going, that might mean that I just dont like black IPAs anymore.
