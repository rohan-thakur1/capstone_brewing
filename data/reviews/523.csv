Piana jest początkowo dość burzliwa, jednak po kilku chwilach pęka do grubszych pęcherzyków i opada w dół.
Na ściankach szkła umiarkowane zdobienia 
 Zapach:  Wspaniała woń słodów wędzonych. Na dzień dobry zapach wędzonej śliweczki. Dalej lekkie nuty dymu z ogniska i pieczonej skórki od chleba. Nie jest to wędzonka na miarę Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier, ale za to profil zapachowy jest tutaj bardziej różnorodny.
Poza wędzonymi nutami sporo gorzkiej czekolady i subtelna paloność. 
 Smak:  W smaku początkowo gładziuteńkie, śliskie na języku, kremowe. Wędzonka zdecydownie w klimacie śliwki węgierki. Mocna, zdecydowana, intensywna.
W oddali spalony patyk z ogniska i subtelna torfowość.
Nuty czekoladowe zostały zepchnięte na drugi plan. Po ogrzaniu uwydatnia się także parzona, mocna kawa. Pojawia się również większa paloność i mocna kwaskowata, ściągająca język wytrawność.
Goryczka średnia, długi wędzony, kwaskowaty finisz.
Średnie ciało, tutaj mogłoby być ono ciut tęższe.
Fest wędzone, solidne piwo. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Kultowy Alaskan Smoked Porter z Browaru Alaskan Brewery z Juneau na Alasce.

Piwo okazało się strzałem w 10-kę, ale zarazem nie przebiło niemieckiego Schlenkerla w kategorii Piw Wędzonych.
Bardzo fajna śliwkowa wędzoneczka, przechodząca w dym spalonego patyka z ogniska.
Dopełnieniem dla niej są akcenty gorzkiej czekolady i mocnej palonej kawy.
Jedynym mankamentem jest silna kawowa wytrawność, która pozostawia nieco drażniące odczucie w ustach.
Faktura średnia i takie samo nagazowanie.
Bardzo dobra pozycja. Punkt obowiązkowy na liście dla wszystkich, którzy uwielbiają piwa wędzone.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

523,"2016-03-30",4.3,"2015 vintage. Pours dark as a starless night. Normal head volume, outstanding lacing and world class retention.

Nearly world class nose of rich smoked malt that delivers a nice campfire bacon aroma. Had it been a bit more intense, it would have achieved world class status. Underneath roll light roast, chocolate and hop notes.

Heavy medium body with a smooth and somewhat creamy texture. World class carbonation that provides a burst in the middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish. The body / carbonation ratio is perfect and really allows the flavor to open up.

The flavor profile is quite outstanding. Surprisingly, the smoked malt delivers a subdued campfire bacon flavor, not the delicious intensity of Schlenkerla. In other words, this one is balanced better. This balance, or lack of smoke intensity, allows the other flavors to shine. Light bitter bakers chocolate, hints of molasses and a light hop spiciness appear from the middle on. Bitterness is light and has both a hop and roast character. As middle bitterness begins to fade, sweetness (caramel, molasses) maximizes and smoked malt comes to the forefront. It delivers a slight campfire bacon flavor but is mostly oak smoke. The finish is slow sweet fade that leaves a lingering oak smoke and just a hint of dryness.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

The flavor is one of charred wood, roasty chocolate, & fruity highlights of cherry or plum as it warms. Theres a pleasant smoky aftertaste & finishing notes of black tea. Its smokey but not terribly bitter as other attempts at rauchbiers outside of Germany can tend to be. 

The mouthfeel creamy, beckoning you to take one more sip.

Kolor: Ciemno brunatny. Piwo jest idealnie klarowne.
Piana: Obfita, drobnopęcherzykowa, mało trwała, pozostawia niezły lacing.
Aromat: Średnio intensywna wędzonka (nie kojarzy się z szynką, raczej w typie dymu z ogniska), rodzynki, trufle z nadzieniem rumowym, czekolada, wędzona śliwka, kawa - aromat jest świetny i bardzo złożony.
Smak: Goryczka niska do średniej, nieco zalegająca, pełnia średnia, piwo jest półwytrawne. Wędzonka (bardziej intensywna niż w aromacie), kawa, rodzynki, rum, czekolada schodzi tu na dalszy plan. Bardzo dobre piwo.
Wysycenie: Niskie do średniego - Ok.
Opakowanie: Charakterystyczna etykieta. Brak konkretnych informacji poza ABV. Poczytałbym to za wadę, gdyby nie to, że piwo jest marką samą w sobie i jest wśród beergeeków bardzo rozpoznawalne.

523,"2015-05-31",4.1,"Poured from bomber into a snifter
 Appearance  The beer pours a super dark brown, bordering on black color with a nice billowy tan colored head. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a god sum of foamy and stringy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is rather strong of a sweeter aroma with lots of molasses and caramel mixed with a good showing of a brownie smell of a slightly burnt and roasty nature. Along with these aromas comes a nice smoky smell mixed with a little bit of a grainy and hay-like aroma. Overall, the aroma is dark, smoky, and sweet. Its quite nice.
 Taste  The taste begins with a sweet caramel and molasses taste as the nose would have suggested. Along with these sweeter tastes is a rather strong roasty flavor containing within a nice hit of grain and char. As the taste advances some of the sweeter tastes dwindle a bit all while more char and some rather smoky flavors come to the tongue. The smoke really comes on strong more toward the end, and with some hay, more roast and a loss of the sweeter tastes, one is left with a rather nice roasty and smoky porter flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is a on the slightly thinner side for a porter with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side as well. The lower carbonation is great for the darker, smoky, and upfront sweet nature of the beer, allowing all the flavors to really coat the tongue. While said, a little thicker of a body would have accentuated these nice flavors even better, really allowing all the dark tastes to linger on the tongue. Overall, the feel was just OK.
 Overall  This was a very flavorful and tasty smoked porter with a nice sweet start mixed with a good showing of smoke and char flavor later on. If only the body was a bit thicker it would have been totally spot one. A very good one to try if you have not yet had it. Quite tasty overall.","","Darkmagus82"

Pours very dark, almost opaque black. 1.5 in thick tan head that retains nicely. Leaves thick, clinging lace as it receded. (This pilsener pour had a much larger head, that collapsed with a very nice visual effect from the bottom up. Also, if I backlit the pilsener, I could see a very dark red color behind the front-lit black.) Smokey aroma, as expected from the name, with a faint meaty bacon or ham note. A bit of a boozy smell, even though it is only 6.5%. Pleasant aroma, but not the traditional beer-like. Smokey flavor on initial taste, with a mild bitterness lasting into the aftertaste. Thick, creamy mouth feel. Almost no carbonation visible in the tulip or in the feel. The smoky bacon is there in the taste, but the smokiness is more subtle than I was expecting. With backlighting in the pilsener, I was able to observe light carbonation. The malt backbone of this beer is well represented, but still, the overriding taste is smoky and somewhat bitter. I would have expected more of a malt-forward taste for a porter, but I do like the taste nonetheless. I have two other bottles that my intention is to drink one per year and see how it ages.

523,"2015-01-11",3.7,"2014 Bottle stamped A2014.
Glass: Tired Hands wine glass.
Appearance: Black body with a creamy mocha head.
Aroma: The aroma is strong of smoke left on clothes after a campfire with a dash of bitter dark chocolate. Aromas of coffee are present, though subdued. The smoke is strong here but not out of order.
Taste: Smoke is prominent, like campfire, that lingers long after the sip. The malt base is a bit mild with hints of chocolate and roasted malts. The body and flavor isnt as robust as the aroma though.
Palate: Medium to thick bodied, mild to moderate carbonation.
Overall: A darn fine smoked beer, one I would like to find on my local liquor store shelves. I wish the body had a little more umph to it though as well as the malt characteristic.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

523,"2014-09-13",4.1,"Illata egy jól ismert, pörkölt malátás hangulatú porter karakterét eleveníti meg, melyhez csak pár fázissal később csatlakozik egy égetett faháncsos, tölgyfás, kissé sós és füstölt húsos aroma. Az illatjegyek között ez esetben is ott bujkál egy édeskés, kávés vonulat, mely kissé finomítja az összképet, ami azonban csak belekóstolva válik igazán kiegyensúlyozottá. A füstös pörköltség foka ugyanis épp ideális ahhoz, hogy ezt a jellemvonást anélkül tudjuk a sör lényegi elemének tekinteni, hogy az összes többi komponens statisztaszerepet játszana az előadásban. Ugyan robusztus, masszív darab, a csípőskés szénsavasság és a kezdeti intenzitás után kisimul a szerkezet, és egyre befogadóbbá válunk az ízjegyek iránt, melyeket egyébként egy karakteresebb porter, vagy éppen stout esetén is örömmel fedeznénk fel azzal a szinte üdítő különbséggel, amit a tölgyfacsipszes pörköltség pikáns vonulata csempész az italunkba. Jellemvonásainak az érlelés következtében történő változása újabb tesztelés alapját képezhetné, biztos vagyok benne, hogy az idő ez esetben csak nemesítené a fenséges testet...","HUNGARY","adster"

523,"2014-07-17",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2016 The archetypical smoked porter, a staple of American craft beer culture and probably the best known beer from the state of Alaska, tasted fresh in 2012 but renowned for its ageing potential, so now revisiting from a four year old vintage bottle.  Very dense, coffee cream-like, fairly thick, yellowish beige head, forming a thick moussy rim around the glass and patches of tan foam in the middle, crowning a very dark chestnut brown beer, as good as black in general appearance, but with reddish brown edges.  Strong bouquet of smoked bacon, smoked herring even, charcoal, bitter chocolate, beef jerky, burnt toast and burnt wood, walnut, roasted pine nuts, cigar tobacco, cold black coffee, black peppercorns, old dried kitchen herbs, black olive, porcini, dried fig, leather, some very vague but perfectly natural iron, very old dried orange peel, vague soy sauce somewhere - and then, especially after warming up, a very elegant, old madera-like touch of oxidation adding subtlety and finesse.  Clean onset, some dried cranberries, fig and a sourish blackcurrant touch, very low in sweetness, followed by a well-positioned, black olive- and cured meat-like umami flavor which extends over a nutty malt core in the middle, providing some very subtle caramelly sweetishness buried under a strong toastedness, roasted bitter and vaguely coffeeish in the end, beautifully connected to the smoked factor which rises up retronasally, cigar tobacco-like, smoked birch wood even, eventually gaining that bacon-like smoked meat flavour you get in all classic Rauchbiers.  Mouthfeel meanwhile is rounded and slick, softly carbonated and a bit thin at first, but gaining body in the finish thanks to the layers of malt.  Ends with lingering roasted bitterness, noble and well integrated smokiness and a peppery, spicy, herbal hop bitter touch supporting the bittering malts, but a remnant of the caramelly sweet touch sticks to the back of the mouth as well; the tiny accent of oxidation is there too retronasally and adds beauty and subtlety.  This is not the most complex beer I tasted so far, not even the most complex porter, but it is a beautiful beer in its balance of toasted bitter and smoked malts with hop bitterness.  A classic in many ways, beautifully and intelligently structured and a delight to slowly savor.  Four years of cellaring have toned it down just a little bit, it seems a tad more mellow than I remember, but that could just as well be my palate having become more adjusted to smoked beers - generally speaking, I think this and other Rauchbiers, whether they are classic Bamberg lagers or modern and porter-based like this one, are so recommended for ageing simply because they do not change dramatically over time; the smoke keeps them from deteriorating even at a modest ABV, comparable to the way food was smoked in bygone eras just to be able to preserve it.  I would not mind tasting this at ten or fifteen years of age as well to see how it evolves further...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

523,"2014-06-04",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2015 2011 vintage, nearly 4 years old. Ive been drinking this beer a long time, but have never rated it. This vintage is one of the best in awhile, though. 
Creamy, generous graham cracker colored head over what appears to be opaque black body, but a bright light behind reveals is deep, clear chestnut brown. Head fades sky leaving some lacing. Aroma is smoke, smoke, and dried cherries, with an undercurrent of black malt. The smoke isnt sharp, though, but mellowed, like the inside of an old cabin. Taste is fire roasted apple and black malt, faint lemon zest, lightly spicy, with that undercurrent of smoke. Finish is slight tart and bitter. Body is thinner than I remember, but middle of the road for a non-imperial porter. Fine, subdued carbonation.

523,"2014-05-28",3.8,"This is a bottle from the 2011 bottling. I worried that I had let this one cellar too long, but I was gladly mistaken. It pours with a black color and a thin, fizzy, light brown head. The aroma lets you know that it is a solid porter at its base, as there is a dark, roasty, bready sweetness, and the smoke adds a wonderful complexity rather than masking everything else. The flavor is so wonderfully meaty, with the smoked malts being much more assertive, although the smoke still doesnt overpower the sweet and roasty characteristics of the porter. Medium bodied and having a light carbonation, the texture supports the flavors nicely. Overall, Im a fan of smoked beers and Im a fan of porters, and this blends the two well.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"

Leaves a thin, creamy top layer and fair amount of lacing. Dark brown with strong amber hue, cant see through but seems relatively clear.


Smell: Smoked, first associations were of light pork meat but combined with salty notes it creates a raw smoked salmon smell - fantastic. Also some light fruity notes, watermelon and little sweet tomatoes. Porter backbone is present, but light - milk chocolate warmth. Its very clean.


Taste: Light sweet middle, some hints of chocolate, caramel, dates, coffee. Very light sour and mineral notes. All builds up and goes to very clear, clean medium bitterness, mostly ash smoke with a bit of roast. Very smooth, light porter milkiness with light hop presence at the end too. 


Mouthfeel: Medium, medium heavy body feel, silky, smooth - very good. Fills the mouth completely.

Fantastic smokey aroma, dark thick syrupy looking pour with a thick reddish-orange brown head that dissipated fast.

523,"2013-06-24",3.9,"This review is a side-by-side tasting of a 2007 (Thanks Keir!) & 2012 bottles. 
Aromatics: The 2007 is missing a lot of the smoke characteristics that the 2012 has more prominently. It replaces the smoke with chocolate, subtle figs/ raisins, and a slight alcohol note. The 2007 edges the 2012 out greatly.
Appearance: Color for both is deep dark and oily looking. 2012 pours with much higher carbonation and head retention. 
Taste: 2007 is much more complex and adds a nice difference to the brew with raisins and figs. But I still do enjoy the smokyness of the 2012.
Palate: 2012 is heavy on bubbles and has a fizzy mouthfeel. The 2007 maintains a just below normal carbonation level. Mouthfeel is much mroe smooth.
Overall: These were both great beers. It definitely got better with age.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","burgy"

Pour has a very dark brown mahogany color and it does still have carbonation and a ring of light brown head that fell off quickly. Aroma opens with a nice sweet smoked malt, light peat, dark bitter chocolate, black coffee, and some campfire. Very lively for a beer of its age. Mouth feel is on the lighter side and there is some slow carbonation kicking around. Flavor has a nice base beer underneath, smoked malt, dark chocolate, light bitterness, and some coffee. I am not generally a fan of smoked beers but this has mellowed so well and the porter itself has enough left to still be plenty flavorful.

Its an especially nice beer to spend most of an evening with, a very nice slow drinker. It just seems to get better and better as it continues to warm and breathe. It serves well as its own fireplace.

523,"2012-08-04",3.7,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.  2009 bottle.

The color of the beer itself is not quite black, with a few ruby-tinted edges.  A medium-sized mocha cap rests on top and leaves a few spots of lace down the sides of the glass.

There is not a heavy smoke presence in the nose, at least with this much time on it.  The aroma is full of fully roasted malt, with smoke, a bit of tobacco, some oak, and a bit of coffee in the background.

My first sip somewhat surprises me.  I was expecting a porter chock full of smokey malt, but this beer is much more subtle.  The roasted malt truly dominates, with just a light sweetness at the front of the sip.  A flare of smoke and tobacco that is rather gentle.  Some bitter chocolate and coffee grounds come in toward the end to provide the bitterness.

In terms of the body, this is right in the middle of the spectrum.  Balanced would be the best way to describe the carbonation - not totally creamy, but not really bold and crisp either.  The bubbles mellow in the background.

As someone who hates the sensation of overly smokey beers, so this has a nice flavor profile for someone of my palate.  I would definitely try this again, and it would be interesting to try a fresher bottle for comparison.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

This sample kept cellared until now, a present from a good friend.Cellar temperature and into a chalice. Pours a radiant and shimmering, deepest ruby with a thin but set and lasting tannish crown that leaves minimal legs. Charcuterie, smoke-house meats come through on first whiff. Meaty, cured pork, smoke ham, Biltong and anchovies amongst ashen peat and heather, strapped leather, Worcestershire sauce, dusty cocoa and heavily roasted coffee beans. The aroma is alive, full and piercing. Husky, smoky start in the mouth. Malt driven, smooth as silk and very long. Differs from the nose. The smoked meats are subdued, mellowed. Saltiness reminiscent of Worcestershire sauce and soft, leathery notes show its age. Bitter malt peak, spicy and peppery in the back with a heftily peaty, charred wood and bonfire ash finish and linger that is all controlling. This is sultry stuff, even after all these years.

Really smokey aroma, almost nicotine smokey. I have been to Bamberg to try the smoked beers there (on a few occasions) and nothing compares to the smokey aroma of this porter.

Too smokey for me to be honest, I tried to get into it, but it isnt a smoked ham or bacon flavour, this is a full in your face smoke house taste.

This beer is like silk. So smooth and creamy; Id like to wrap up in this next to the fire. Subtle carbonation throughout. The cocoa and coffee comes out a bit in the flavor as well, and leaves a bit of a charred flavor in there as well. The smoky character comes out in the backend, leaving a roasted aftertaste.

523,"2012-03-20",4.6,"Bottle 66 cl, thanks to Tim. 2011. Okay, time has stopped. Had some years ago the 2009 version, and I stated as the best smoked ever had. No way. Time has passed, beers so, and Im in front of the Alaskan Smoked Porter again. In consequence, my expectations was really high. And wasnt disappointed. Indeed, OVERTAKED. ABSOLUTELY. Where do we start? Appearance is blackier than black, with a balanced beige foam; you could pour even from 10 cm and it doesnt override glass. This just for starting. Aroma is the triumph of smoke. High complexity that begins to provola (smoked cheese from South of Italy) and finish to bacon. But isnt aggressive, elegance is even that of smoked fish, salmon, tuna. Also youll find a gentle dark fruits bouquet, some sugar notes too. And crisp, incredibly crisp. Taste? Oh my, rarely Ive found such a drinkability. Carbonation brush perfection, texture is oily, body light to medium, malt astonishing and full of ashes, coal, wood, shorter in chocolate. herbs and young plums. Finish is initially thin, but after grows like a big wave from distance to the only goal of harshing; dries all your mouth not with an hop slaps, but like young fruit or whiskey or licorice or burned bread crust. It lasts incredibly for minutes, trust me. Youll chew and chew with nothing, but youre forced to without disturbing. And warms softly throat, no booze at all. What should I say? Not rated as Westies or top class IRS/DIPA, but one of the best beer in the world as well.

Further inhalation reveals some semi sweet and dark chocolate malt, caramel, oak, and roast. There is some balancing bitterness on the back end as well. The flavor follows with the dry, meaty smoke and wood up front followed by the dark chocolate and sweet caramel malts which add some nice sweetness to all the smoke and roast.

523,"2011-01-13",4.5,"From notes:

Pours a very dark chestnut brown color that appears black in the glass and almost completely opaque. Huge three finger frothy, pillowy mocha head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that cots the glass with large chunks of soapy lacing.

Very smokey malt aroma with hints of BBQ, charcoal, bacon, butane and campfire. Theres also some roasted coffee bean, silky chocolate and burnt toast in the nose.

Full bodied, so much so you can practically chew on this beer. This beer has a huge smokey flavor with hints of bacon, charcoal and barbecue but it also has a creamy lactic presence mid-palate that provides excellent balance and complexity. Hints of silky chocolate, toffee, coffee bean, wood and more smoke. The balance, complexity and well masked ABV make this beer extremely quaffable. Although, it is one of the smokier beers Ive had, its not a complete smoke bomb. Even if you dont like this style and/or rauchbiers I still recommend that you give it a try.

The peppered salami comes through on the flavor, very clean and bright. As is definitely the quality of the style, the malt profile is as if they were grilled over a hearty backyard firepit.

523,"2010-08-12",4.0,"2009 bomber.  Pours deep black / brown with tan / brown colored head, which lingers around with nice lacing.  Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and most prominently smoked meat, pork, brunswick stew.  Taste initially reveals rich roasted flavors, which are sweetened slightly by chocolate, and then continues to smoked bacon flavors which expand in intensity and complexity on the finish.  This beer has a very nice palate, smooth silky mouth feel, medium to full bodied.  The smokiness on the finish is almost spicy, as if I was eating a pulled pork sandwich with some tangy barbecue sauce.  Yet I wouldnt go so far as to put the smokiness / roasted meat aspect of this beer on the same level as Aecht Schlenkerla for example.  This beer is more subtle, although the smokiness does dominate the aroma, it is more subdued in the flavor, which also features some nice chocolate / espresso tones.

523,"2010-05-23",3.7,"22oz bomber purchased from Liquid Solutions

Appearance: Pours a murky brown with a small 1 finger mocha head. Some retention and a fair amount of lacing.

Smell: Smoked wood, nuts, a touch of sweet malt, roasted barley, and chocolate. Well done.

Taste: After having some German Rauchbiers I was really expecting more smoke from this brew. Still a well balanced mix of flavors that encompass the same notes as the nose.

Mouthfeel: not creamy enough IMHO. Good but no wow factor.

Drinkability: A touch thick in body preventing me from giving it more than a 4.0 but still nice.

A good brew although I was expecting more.

Aroma is smoke up front, mild roast, licorice, a hint of earth, and musty old firewood. Flavor is light smoke and a hint of dark caramel up front, the smoke flavor really evolves as the beer rolls over the palate as does the malt heavy profile. The light smoke and dark caramel give way to bittersweet chocolate and sweet pipe tobacco smoke, finishing with fantastic hardwood smoke, roast and a little salty, earthy wood. Palate is medium bodied with a creamy entry, slightly chalky and dry but still creamy middle and a more chalky and dry finish. Really the palate changes  compliment the evolution of the flavor profile perfectly, I would like to see how it would be with a slightly lower carbonation (it is a bit sharp for the style), but it is pretty awesome where it is now.

I imagine cellaring for a long period would allow the other flavors to brighten up and smooth out the smoke. The feel is good, bubbly and mouth-coating.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

A nice brown head that dissipates to a film and clings to the corners. Aromas are good smokiness, heavy meaty jerky smell, salty and marinated meat, light woody ashy smoke as well. A medium bodied porter preaches meaty smoke and ashy wood, a lighter roasted malt gives way to a good smoked malt which is a style I love. Lighter feel, emphasizing smoke is a good example of the style. Faint bitterness, largely a wonderful example of a smoky dark beer. A decent roastiness underneath leads to a good balance.

523,"2009-09-05",4.2,"2008 Vintage. A real WTF moment when I finally noticed I had never properly pounded out some notes for this beer.

Appearance: Pours out a dark brown, near black body with some ruby-hued edges and a topped by a frothed, beige head.

Smell: A distinct aroma with its alder wood aspect thats always suggestive of high quality smoked meats. Also some roasty and unsweetened chocolate notes as well as a waft of dark fruits.

Taste: Though the smoked alder wood is full and present in the flavor, it doesnt totally squash the beers other characteristics. Roasty, sweetish malts with some subtle chocolate tones and even milder hint of decaffeinated coffee. Touch of dark fruitiness in the background. Slight clean bitterness present. The smokiness remains beyond the drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Fairly smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: With its relatively lighter body and good balance, this one is just that much more drinkable and it can become quite difficult not to grab a few bombers and drink yourself into a stupor on the couch. Its a beer Im always happy to have regardless of vintage or time of year it happens to be.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
523,"2009-09-05",3.7,"660ml bottle (Cracked Kettle, Amsterdam)
Very dark brown, large dark doughy head. fairly subdued aroma, dry, lightly smoked, and a touch burnt. Quite lively carbonation, crisp palate, smooth too. Some burtness in the retronasals, more than smokiness. Taste is malt dominated, a burnt roast, with a little bite of astringency. Smokey phenols seem to reinforce the burntness rather than stand on their own. Finish is certainly interesting, theres a touch more smoke than the taste, but also some drying ashiness, a delicate little hoppy bite, and lasts pleasantly long. No chance of 6.5% ever making its way through the flavours in this one - gluggable! And yup, this was one thirst-quenching brew!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

523,"2009-06-24",4.2,"Complements of alldaydrinker who was kind enough to swap a CL Rosso for an 05 of this. Pours a near-opaque black colour (a bit of ruby edges when held to the light) with a thin, but lasting tan head that leaves spotty lacing. The nose is of orasted chocolate malt, red grapes, dates, and of course, highly pronounced hickory-like smoke. The flavour is intensely smokey and wonderfully mellow. Notes of bacon dominate throughout, with roasted malts, lightly roasted coffee and dark chocolate coming through moreso in the finish, which is medium in duration. Even before the smoke hits though, there is a moment where suggestions of malted milk balls is distinctive, and delicious! The palate is silken with soft carbonation and a full body that coats tooth and gum. The aging process, though beneficial to the smoothness of the palate and melding of flavours, must have also cut away from the hop presence significantly, as there are almost none to be detected. Mild citrus possibly. Either way, this is an outstanding brewski. Thanks Jeff!","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

The initial pour has a thick tan head but it fades as quick as the pour. You can really smell the smoked  malt blended with the chocolate in the aroma. The initial sip has so much smoke with the right amount of blended chocolate and roasted malt. There is a small hop bitterness, but nothing distinguishable. This particular beer has been aging for 4 years so that may have diminished the hop flavors as well as some other flavor the brewer was going for.

523,"2009-05-04",3.9,"The Alaskan Smoked Porter was one of the very first beers I purchased when I arrived in Seattle.  Its fame had trickled into Colorado through scattered channels, and bottles of it were everywhere in Seattle - about as ubiquitous as hipsters, but a little less judging.  Its a predictably subterranean dark beer.  Youd be better off using echo location to peer inside your glass.  The nose immediately comes off as smoky, even burnt, redolent with charcoal, seared steak and mesquite wood.  Im immediately hungering for a medium-rare ribeye, but dinners still lingering in the stomach, so I keep feasting on the porter.  The second sampling of the aroma introduces more eats, and fewer incinerated smells.  Cumin, coffee, a hint of raisin make appearances.  I wade into the beer, now up to my mouth, catching jerky spices, black pepper, cumin, cured meat and enough raisin to balance against the spicy and savory flavors.  The palate is well weighted for this heavy flavor profile, burly enough to carry the assemblage of tastes on its mouthfeel palanquin with confidence.  It is a perfectly drinkable beer, and I think a welcome introduction to Alaskan Brewerys capabilities.

Smooth, lightly sweet entry leads into a light bakers chocolate and a light woodiness followed by some sweet (brown sugar) meatiness paired with a moderate smokiness and some soft undertones of vanilla that finishes with a lightly dry woodiness and a bit of lingering smoke.

A smooth flavor with very little hop taste. Its got a light aroma and a great color. Pretty good mouthfeel to it. The smokey flavor is quite a joy in itself.

Huge, agressive aroma of smoked, salted pork and campfire. Scents of crackers and tobacco add some depth. Malty and smokey with a light sweetness on the tongue. Medium to heavy bodied. Generous flavors of burnt wood, earthy peat and smoked meat. A bitter hop flavor comes forward and gives way to a mild chocolate aftertaste. I love a big smokey beer and this was better than I imagined it would be. Surprisingly drinkable for the style as well.

523,"2009-04-04",3.8,"From a bomber. Beer is very dark brown, clear. Head is initially largish, light brown, frothy. Diminishes mostly into a fluffy ring with a small centralized petri dish skim.

The aroma is malty with heavy notes of roasted grain, lighter notes of dark coffee; Moderate notes of salty smoky meat and campfire.

The flavor is moderately bitter, lightly acidic, trace sweet with a long, lightly/moderately bitter finish. Genuine camp fire retronasal aroma is pleasing. 

The body is medium, the texture is watery/velvety and the carbonation is average/fluffy.

A light amount of porter-like chocolates and roasts, but mainly a smokey campfire aroma. Flavor is very solid. Lots of initial smokiness with a big body. Light, but balancing amounts of milk chocolate and roasted grains come in before a slow, dry, woody finish. Some hops creep their way into the finish as well, but mainly a big, but not too big smoke finish. Really nice. Never gets overpowering. Palate is full with a light tickle of carbonation.

The flavor consisted of ashy, charred wood, bittersweet chocolate, a hint of dark fruit, and a touch of caramel.

Anyways, a nice chocolate flavor is also present and some general roastiness.  This is all very well blended and melded.

Both are up front with smoked, salty meats, though the 2008 also finishes this thought with some sharper campfire smoke. Both have a milky, milk chocolaty maltiness that shines through more in the 2007, creating a greater balance with the smoke, though in the 2008, the smoke dominance is more interesting and lively with the campfire notes and a tangier, sweeter feel from the meat smokes. Long sentence. I did feel that the smoke and the milkiness in the 2007 were both solid qualities in their own right, but didnt seem to want much to do with each other, so the 2008 with its more dominant and interesting smokiness wins out.

Nose is sufficiently smoky with smoked wood and ash, bitter chocolate, and earthy coffee bean notes.  The smoked alder really comes through in the flavor and is more likable than I would have thought; other notes include scorched wood, bitter chocolate, lightly roasted earthy coffee, and faint notes of molasses.  Palate is medium, nearly lively, and creamy with some dryness from the smoked wood notes.  Finishes more dry and mostly bitter with smoked wood, bitter chocolate, and light acidity of the coffee.  I liked it more than I thought I would after smelling how smoked the beer was from the nose.

Vintage 2006 Reviewed in Sept 2009
Appearance:  Pours a very dark brown with an oily layer of swirls at the top.

Aroma:  Smoked wood and smoked meat, beef jerkey, and rubber tires.

Taste:  Strong wood notes to start off, liquid smoke, ham. After getting through the smokey woods so to speak, I find roasted malts with a spicy hop finish.

Mouthfeel: Thick and fizzy.

Overall:  I thought the smoke would be subdued after time has passed. This seems far more smokey than the 2007 and 2008 batch when it was fresh. I do remember 2006 being a real smokey beer, and I am glad it stayed that way.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

523,"2008-08-08",4.5,"19-Jan-08 (Draft: Connoisseurs Session, 2008 Great Alaskan Beer and Barley Wine Festival in Anchorage, AK) 1996 vintage What a treat to try a 12-year-old Smoked Porter.  Its very smoky, but more campfire than bacon.  Also very roasty, but only a medium level of bitterness.  Dry on the palate, not very sweet at all.  Medium-full in body and medium in carbonation.  The nose is smoky but less roasty.  Dark-brown, almost opaque, and the small, dark-tan head settles to a wide ring.  This beer has held up wonderfully, so Ill keep holding onto my private stash of bottles. (8, 4, 8, 4, 16 = 4.0)21-Jan-06 (22 oz bottle: $4.99 at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) 2005 bottling Revisiting this beer just to see if I still like it as much, and yes, I absolutely believe I do.  Big, roasty maltiness, sweet chocolate and molasses work in unison with the strong smokiness to absolutely thrill my taste buds.  The smoke is pretty powerful, but not as intense or dominant as in the Schlenkerla Rauchbier lineup.  Plenty of roasty bitterness balances out the sweetness.  Some yeasty flavor in the background.  Aroma is sweet, roasty, malty and smoky, but because of the level of sweetness, it doesnt smell like smoked meats.  Body is rich, thick and heavy, well-carbonated, smooth and velvety on the palate.  Very dark brown, pretty much black through the center, ruddy brown highlights at the edges.  Light tan head rises to over half an inch, but settles fairly quickly to a wide ring, leaving spotty, patchy lacing on the glass.  Just an incredible beer...it doesnt get much better than this. (9, 4, 9,5, 18 = 4.5) 14-Sep-04 (16 oz bottle: $4) 2003 Vintage Sweet Jesus! A strong smoky aroma emanates from the bottle as soon as the twist-off cap is removed; It pours so thick and viscous, its like motor oil; Its so black and opaque, the motor oil comparison is still quite apt; Once in the glass, the smoky aroma is intense, like walking through into a recently burned out building; The flavor is, you guessed it, intensely smoky, one of the smokiest beer Ive tasted; Its fairly sweet, but not overly so, and whats extraordinary, is that this beer starts out dry, bitter, chocolaty and very dark roasted (burned is more like it), but the sweetness picks up strength in the finish -- very unusual; With how viscous the beer pours, the full bodied palate isnt as heavy or sticky as I expected; Dark tan head is of modest size on the pour, and its very slow to form through the thick viscosity of this beer, but once formed, it demonstrates very good retention; Some of the head sticks to the glass, but quickly fades away, leaving no trace of lacing; However, with all the superlatives of this beer, the lack of lacing is of no consequence to me, and doesnt diminish the appearance score because the absolute blackness and head retention of this porter is very impressive; I thought Stones Smoked Porter was a pretty outstanding effort, but this beer makes Stones taste like Porter Lite, and we know thats not the case; I mean, wow, this is an incredible beer, Im totally blown away; It has to be a top 20 beer all time for me.

The smoke flavor is not obtrusive at all, the bittering hops however, are (in my oppinion). The combination of smoke and chocolate maltiness made me sit and sip this beer for about an hour. I like it alot.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Dmalone102"

A bit too much smoke for me to drink by itself in large quantities, but just fine to pair with the ribs I made tonight.

Smell is nice and, of course, smoky - smoked bacon and charcoal.  Underlying sweet malt notes also present.  Sweet roasted malts are much more prevalent in the taste up front before giving way to the smoke taste in the finish.  There are also definite coffee and chocolate notes in the taste though they are supporting the smokiness.  The finish also has a bit of pine hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is smooth and pretty crisp with the hop finish.  Not a lot of carbonation in the body.

the appearance of this beer is opaque black with some nice thin tan head. 

the smell is very complex. i detect smoke, toffee, chocolate and upon swilling the beer, the smoke seemed to rise from the glass. i also detect some nutty malty sweetness.

the taste is as complex as the smell and consistant. this beer has WAY more dimension than the 2007 i tried not too long ago.

the mouthfeel is very heavy and full and should be an example for this style.

Aroma of dark smoke (AHH!) from hardwood (assuming oak and birch), peat, meat, with a tiny note of lab quality sucrose.  Hits the mouth with a heavy wide body, smoke comes through very nicely with a bit of cream in the backdrop, very thick on the palate overall, nice dark bakers chocolate comes in on the backend, finish... well, it cant finish because I keep on taking sips!!!

The chocolate and burnt marshmallow aromas bely a spot on smore next to the campfire.   Lots of smokey, salty dark chocolate flavor.   The smoke is more prevalent than other smoked porters that Ive had, but still is well integrated.   Medium bodied with light, creamy bubbles.   Age has treated this well, but not having had it fresh, I really cant compare.   I could definitely put down a few pints of this.

523,"2008-04-19",4.1,"2007.  Pours charcoal black with a glimmer of mahogany; topped with regal, laced espresso foam.  Soft of aroma of brown sugar, mexican chocolate and maple cured ham; a sharp expired waft of coffee grounds and clangy citrus oils whimpers in a little but suffocates quickly beneath the weight of charred roast beef, rustic and full of muscle.  Flavor has a delicate red wine quality that suggests what Merlot should taste like; dusty, quieted, refined silky fruit characteristics in stride with a dark, decadent sweetness.  Full swallows yield warming bursts of cinnamon, anise, and heavyweight african coffee beans; sips the smoothness of pine smoke and meandering citrus sweetness.  Middle mainly of blackberry.  Palate is unexpectedly light in weight but simply could not be smoother or more caressing; body is medium with polished carbonation and full sensual creaminess.  Finish shows some tartness and a finalizing, salted bacon and rich malt smack.  Rustic but classy; it would fit just as favorably as a fine aperitif or as a dirty outdoors cigar accompaniment.

Initial flavor of milk chocolate, tobacco, and black patent malts, countered by a good amount of bitterness, char, peat, and tobacco. The finish is very ashy and peppery, with some astringency. Out of the fridge, its too bitter and smoky. At cellar temp, the malts and residual sweetness blend in to tame the finish.

523,"2008-01-08",3.9,"2006 Vintage:  
1/08/2008:  As soon as the cap is popped off, a deep, meaty smoke and char rolls out of the bottle.  The flavor starts dry with chocolate, caramelized and roasted malts and then the smokiness and a hint of sweetness comes through.  The smoke has a light meatiness to it as well and lingers on the palate and hangs in the back of the throat.  Alaskan Smoked Porter 2006 is dark brown (cola/coffee-colored) and clear.  There really isnt any lasting head or crown and the carbonation is fine and smooth.  It has a medium body and goes down easily.  As the beer warms, a lasting, creamy tan head forms, it becomes more rich, a dark chocolate flavor becomes noticeable, the smoke and char deepens, the body fills out more, and it seems more creamy on the palate.  Overall, this beer has a nice level of smokiness and is quite balanced and robust.  Now I am eager to try this beer with 4-5 years of age on it as I was actually hopeing for somehting a bit more from this beer...

It definitely has the malty taste I like, but the smoke comes through so much in the nose that I had to just accept it and let it accentuate the malt to get its overall effect.

523,"2007-11-22",4.4,"2005.  Looks like one hell of a porter.  Dark dark brown to black with a thin densish tan head.  The nose is big and bold.  An almost roasty coffee note comes straight out.  However, it appears to be coming with a sticky sweet salty smoke aspect coming out of the bacon delirious smoky aspect.  A small amount of chocolate malt and some decent caramel malt sweetness. Rather smooth, along the lies of smoked salmon, richness included.  Small piney aspect.  This is actually a bit thin in the mouth, with low carbonation.  but upon reflection, isnt that kind of what a a porter should be.  I mean, when I drink it, I see the sweetness is bigger than your average porter, but that can be separated from the mouthfeel being a bit low, like a porter.  If you think not, then this beer isnt as good.  The big smokey bacon is tinkered with by a bit of caramel sweetness and some smal coffee.  Almost leaves a acidic almost cola sort of finish.  Very nice balance.  Great complexity.  Very tannic bitter finish.  Roasty coffee bitterness with a bit of good fruit acidity like a very nice coffee.    Even though theres a little alcohol and diacetyl than comes through, I feel like it is jsut deliverying a wider array of flavors to my taste buds.  This beer is fucking off the hook.  As it warms I notice some apple aspected up front AND in the finish.  This beer is so fucking complex it isnt funny.  It is a flavor assault, there is so much going on.  Nevermind the fact that this smells great, and is complex.  I think the only failing is the body isnt fuller, but to be hones, I think the smoke travels best on the lightness.  If this were thicker, it would make this more like a bit of tar in the mouth.  The level of concetration of these flavor aspects would be too high.  Oh my how Id love more of this here beer!  I may have to put in an order online!!!!  Now I think Im going to crack out that 5 year aged gouda for pairing with this bad boy, Thanksgiving fullness, be damned!

Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic and the long finish is moderately acidic and lightly bitter. Palate is medium, watery yet a touch syrupy and has a fizzy carbonation. This was much better as it warms. Very unique, I liked it a lot. A good choice for a winter night indoors by a fire.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

523,"2007-11-03",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2008 10/24/07 From 2007 bottle.  Aroma is rauche-like smoked malt forward followed by a slight saltiness.  The smoke is a bit overpowering of the porter character.  Appearace is dark brown with a low light tan head.  Flavor is a rich smoke/roast blend that is well balanced.  Simple, with no hop character, but quite good.  Mouthfeel is medium/high bodied with a medium carb feel and light creaminess.  Overall, this is very good, but needs better aroma balance; fortunately the flavor preserves a lot of porter character.

9/23/08 From 2001 22oz bottle. Aroma is dark fruit with smoke forward and a light alcohol background. Appearance is dark brown with a low tan head.

523,"2007-10-28",3.6,"2006 label.  Having really liked a certain smoked Porter recently, I wanted to see how this compares.  It didnt so well, but maybe its because this was bottled and that wasnt.  Maybe the most smoky Ive had a Porter yet, but there wasnt a lot in the way of sweetness to balance it out.  And it had that rather filling sensation when putting it down that I dont so care for.  Ive actually another bottle here for a re-try to see if impressions change.

The finish is decidedly more smoky, pretty interesting for me the rauchbier noob.  Palate was medium to light, with little carbonation.

523,"2007-07-29",4.0,"Bomber, 2005 vintage. Pours black with dark-brown edges, and a dense velvety beige head. Aroma is semi-sweet dark and roasted malt punctuated by smoke and charred wood. Flavor has a bit more of the malt, which is quite complex, ranging from sweetish notes to bitter chocolate, wood, and considerable roastiness, plus a hint of smokiness. Gets better with a more balanced and complex mingling of flavors and aromas as it warms. This is excellent, though not really a rauchbier in the usual sense -- more of a quality strong porter with some smokiness added to the mix, so you might like this even if you dont like smoked beers in general. Highly recommended.","Falmouth, Cornwall, ENGLAND","Delirium"
523,"2007-07-28",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2009 Rated 7/27/07.  2005 vintage.  Bomber at Freakin Frog in Las Vegas, NV.  Black body with mahogany edges.  Minimal head that quickly recedes completely.  The aroma is like the fire pit at a barbeque joint!  Very strong, smokey smell that is hard to cut through.  I found some sweet malty notes in there, but I feel like I singed my nosehairs in the process!  The flavor is intense at first, with a smokey, oakey, campfire-esque profile.  As it sits and warms in the glass, in mellows considerably and starts to reveal its sweeter side, with chocolatey malts fighting their way through the smoke.  Medium to full body.  Fairly smooth finish.  This beer is tough to guage, because it changes considerably as it sits.<b>I have some recommendations for enjoying this beer....</b>1)  Enjoy it with a friend, as I did.  It is an intense beer and youre probably not going to be able to kill a bomber unless youre really into this style.2)  Pair it with the right food.  I was not eating at the time, but I think this brew would be better served as a compliment to some sort of grilled game, or perhaps a roast pork.3)  Taste it in stages.  The intensity mellows out considerably as it sits and warms.  Its really almost a different beer at the end of the glass than it is at the beginning.  A <i>better</i> beer, in my opinion.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

523,"2007-07-05",4.4,"Best smoked porter I have ever had.   Nice smoked aroma and flavor with a slight chocolate overtone.   I first had it on tap in Scagway Alaska at the Red Onion in 2006. You can find it bottled throughout the North West but its much better on tap.  I believe its only made during the month of October but it does seem to get better with age. 
Living on the East coast, it can be a little hard to find without the right connections.

523,"2007-07-04",4.2,"2002 vintage courtesy of Ughsmash by way of mswf.  A huge ""thank you!!!!"" to both of them for this rare treat.  I was very much aniticipating this one as the 2002 is widely considered one of the hallmark years for this beer.  SMOKE!!  Thats all you need to know.  Ive yet to have had an American smoked ""anything"" that matches up well to the famed Bamberg beers that I hold so dear.  This one does just that.  What makes it even more remarkable is how well its held up after five years.  This must have had just an insane smoke quality to it when fresh.  Now, the porter-side of the beer matches perfectly to the rauch side.  Great balance with this beer.  Nice toasted malt notes that stand-up very well to the aggressive smoked side.  Coffee, bittersweet chocolate and bits of burnt caramel.  Smoke on the aroma, palate and finish are touched with a bit of peppery spiciness.  Body a bit light and a little sad to see it was not bottle conditioned.  This makes it even more remarkable to me how well it held up.  Worth the hype for this particular vintage.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

The aroma was very heavily smoked, even after the 5 years.. roasted bakers chocolate beneath, providing a wonderful base... some sweet notes emerge as an afterthought, and make this truly decadent!  Flavor had almost burnt, semi-sweet chocolate at the core.. some coffee bitterness with very well-smoked beechwood rising above all.. semi-sweet chocolate and plum skins with that wonderful smoke through the finish.  This was a little lighter-bodied than Id like, but it felt great.. slightly grainy, well-smoked, with a long, camp-fire-infused chocolate finish.  Just loved it!

When I first started rating beer, I had heard about this beer since it had won in the battle of the beers online competition on realbeer.com.

Pretty decent.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
523,"2007-06-30",4.5,"Approximately 3 oz. sample at the Grand Tasting of the RateBeer Summer Gathering 2007 in the Twin Cities, MN on July 23, 2007. I took about 1.5 oz. of all of the other beers. I initially took a 1.5 oz. sample of this one, but it was so good that I went back for another even with all of the other great beer available and even after I said I had stopped drinking for the night. This was the twentieth of 26 beers that I sampled and rated during the tasting. Smoky aroma with both Scotch-ale-esque peat-like and Rauchbier-esque sausage-like scents. Very strong and superb aroma. Pours a dark brown with a light tan head. Looks like rich, dark, melted chocolate. Smoky, almost burnt, flavor obvious. Sweet, malty base that is also surprisingly hoppy. Delicious. Long, roasted, smoky aftertaste. Medium to heavy body. Alaskan Smoked Porter has just the right level of smoke; it is very smoky but not overwhelming. More importantly, the underlying beer is probably the best Ive ever had in a smoked. This would be a top-notch porter even without the smoke. Perhaps because of my Scotch whisky background, Im a sucker for a good smoked beer (Im even tempted to switch my favorite style designation from IPA to Smoked after trying this gem), and Alaskan Smoked Porter definitely qualifies in that category. This has been near the top of my personal most wanted list ever since I really got into beer, and I am happy to say that I am anything but disappointed. This was the best beer that I had at the tasting. Thanks to Skyview for letting me try this masterpiece.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

22 oz bomber
Moderate pour in a stein.
2006 version, consumed 06/07

Poured black with some faint brown highlight with a large frothy somewhat lasting head with fair lacing.

Smelt of strong smoke with moderate chocolate, coffee, burnt grain, It is also reminescent of smoked salmon in a way...   Maybe just a brain associatioin, Alaska, salmon, smoked, but it is oddly mineral.

Taste was upfront perfectly balanced strong smoke wit hmoderate chocolatey bitter sweet touches followed by a more pronounced moderate roasted malt bitterness and some cocoa and faint sour and sweet dried dark fruit.

Palate was medium bodied, softly carbonated, creamy and velvety and lightly astringent.

Overall, smoked porters are my favorite style so the points are skewed a bit, but I think I have found the paragon of the style.  There is definately a mineral edge to it, and that puts it over the top.  I need more of this or I need to move to Alaska.

After about 2/3rds of this was finished, I started snacking on rosemary crackers and sharp cheddar cheese, the strong flavors seemed to neutralize some of the smokiness of the beer and the sweetness and complex subtle flavors really came through.

Thanks to hezron for following one excellent beer with another.  This was a bottle that he had been hanging on to for a while - the bottle said it was a 2004 vintage.  If the other Alaskan beers are anything like this someone up there is doing an excellent job.
Aroma / Appearance - Smoked hickory chips begin an intoxicating aroma which also contains coffee, slow roasted barbequed meat and peppermint extract.  While not very dense it invites further reflection.  The body was about as dark as you would expect from a porter with no head.
Flavor / Palate - Smoky ham, onions, tomatoes and pepperoni remind me of a Papa Murphys take and bake pizza (due to the lack of greasiness).  I could almost imagine it being the seconds eaten for breakfast the next day due to the coffee taste that follows.  While it does not stick to the throat it has enough body to make itself known.  The finish is a midafternoon snack of licorice, plums and blueberries.  The smoke comes through strongest in the finish though it does not overwhelm the senses.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Oddly, for such a great flavor it is fairly simple. Just loas of smoked wood and toasty goodness. Kind of a burnt oat bread thing as well.

Aromas of heady smoked malts, licorice, plum, mild hops, tar, molasses and fleshy fruit, almost like baked coconut. flavor leads with smoke and hops, quickly trounced by the malt, an onslaught of flavor and intensity that is both unexpected and expertly laid out before me. Palate was wonderfully creamy and roasty at the same time. This beer crushed my previous favorite smoked porter, from Stone. More smoke, more everything.

The chocolate flavour was milk-chocolate rather than the bitter dark/cacao chocolate that I love.  Nice creamy body.

523,"2006-11-17",4.1,"This was the 2nd of 2 beers that I had while visiting my bro and his family on Labor Day and it was a damn near perfect match for what he was cookin. Meat was on the menu and it was BBQd up and mopped with some fine local (and not so local) sauces. This beer paired up incredibly well with the smoky/savory meat flavor, but here are my thoughts on the beer itself (and not my bros great BBQ). Aroma was smokey of course, and I never hide the fact that I love smoked ales or rauchbiers of any kind. I thought the smoky aroma was more pronounced that say...Stones Smoked Porter, but less than...Aecht Schlenkerlas rauchbier. So this covers the middle ground for me. Appearance was black, tannish head with some dark brown highlights around the edges. Mouthfeel was creamy and coating but still not heavy somehow. Flavors were smoky malts, but there was a bit of ashyness there too like sniffing a fresh charcoal briquette. It was also a little sweet but balanced nicely by the smoky bitterness. I was greatly please that I had picked this to take with me and enjoy while having some great BBQ. It definitely made the whole thing just better.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

523,"2006-09-18",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2015 2005 bottle sampled Sept 2006.
Pours a deep black with a rich brown head. The aroma is dominated, unsurprisingly, by an enjoyable smokiness but the flavor is well-balanced. The smoke is still up front, but not as aggressively so as some of the german smoked beers; we also get a warm maple-syrup sweetness and ample notes of strong dark coffee. Very nice. 7/4/7/4/5

12/2009 Tap at Fiddlers. Beautiful balance, totally restrained smoke that is there in the flavor profile but far in from in your face. Beautiful. 7/4/8/4/15=3.8

1996 bottle (!!!) sampled at Fiddlers 5/13/15. Alaska brought this one by for a Seattle Beer Week event. Neon purple label. Im a bit surprised to realize it, but at 19 years of age, this might be the oldest beer Ive had to date. Not a lot of body left to this; the smokiness has intensified. Quite tasty in its own special way and pretty impressive both that it has held up at all, and that Alaska was brewing a beer like this back in 1996 when the rest of us thought we were craft beer connoisseurs as we drank Sierra Nevada Pale, Sam Smiths, Sam Adams, and Petes Wicked Ale (remember that crap?). Im not to going to try to put a numeric rating down here, but quite a treat to be able to try this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

523,"2006-09-02",4.4,"750 ml. bomber courtesy of one of my best friends who made a special effort to bring this back from Alaska for me - thanks, John!!! Ever since I first had Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier at the Gasthaus Schlenkerla in Bamberg in 1993, Ive been a fan of smoked beer. This offering from Alaskan Brewing does not disappoint. A dense brown-black pour supports a durable tan head. Smokey aroma is very obvious, but theres much going on underneath that with some molasses and spice. Rich and smooth, with light fine carbonation. Smoke comes through up front in the flavor, but again there is a lot more to savor. Sweet, burnt caramel. dark roasted grain,all easing into a bitterness that is in part grainy, but also citrusy and astringent. A nicely dry bitter finish that really lasts. This is a keeper, complex and rewarding.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"
523,"2006-09-02",4.6,"Absolutely amazing! 
2005 version in a bomber. Served in my pint glass staring at 50 degrees.

Appearance: Pours a beautiful dark midnight black (completely opaque) with a 1-2 figure chocolaty brown head. Mediocre lacing and decent minimal carbonation.

Smell: Wow! Its a combination of my humidor, a campfire and some mesquite smoking chips. A bit of charcoal and some underling burnt caramel malts.

Taste: I have never tasted anything like this before. I loved it! It had a distinct smoke flavor font, middle and end. I had this beer beside and after some homemade Baked beans (thanks juzy for the recipe) and B&J Brown bread. What a heavenly treat!!! As soon as I put the kids to bed I am going outside for a cigar just to finish off a great evening. The taste (along with the fantastic smoke flavor) has a very definitive dark roasted chocolate malt character and a sweet dark fruit flavor like mild currants and prunes. There is a bit of a bacony quality as well. The woody earthy attribute is fantastic and this tasty beer is incredibly easy to drink. Each sip begs for another. It is great for thinking about and even better for drinking. It is magnificently balanced with sweetness and also the evident hops, all lying under the campfire smoke. 

Mouthfeel: A nice strong malt backbone lends way to a splendid creaminess and a slight hint of bitter tingles from time to time, immediately washed down by more smooth creamy full-bodied beer.

Drinkability: This is so incredibly easy to drink it is nearly mind blowing! This beer is definitely something special. I often put a cork back in the 22 oz bomber, saving the second half for the next day. This beer I corked but before I knew it I was re-filling my pint glass. I wish Alaskan Smoked Porter were available in my area. It would certainly be a regular in my house.

Hope this is helpful.
Cheers!","Paradise, Pennsylvania, USA","Phatz"
523,"2006-08-28",3.8,"I am always skeptical about opening a smoked beer, because I will freely admit that it is not my taste at all, and I also would never be trading to get any of these, BUT - this one is really good.  Porter, so its a good style to start with, then you add a little hint of smoke to it, and it makes it rather interesting.  Rich, full bodied, roasted chocolate and smoked malts make this one a very unique beer.  Unlike the other smoked beers where I have either poured them out, or choked them down, this one I did neither with.  Pleasing to drink, smooth, rich, and pretty good.  The smokiness is not offensive at all on this beer.  Went pretty good with some smoked sausage.

My bottle was from 2005 and poured lovely ink black with modest head and a heavy mouthfeel.

The flavor is actually first and foremost a great porter with smoke at the end. The smoke is a well integrated part of the beer and not the overwhelming flavor. I had a newer one a couple months ago that I did not rate, but I remember the smoke flavor was more pronounced on it. It would seem this is a better beer after a couple of years in the cellar.   Im having an 07 bottle in Feb 09 and this beer is real nice.

Turtle mocha chocolate bricks thrown onto the summer grill with no slit to let the smoke escape.  Burnt and scraped semi-sweet chocolate chips.

523,"2006-06-08",3.8,"ah, everything tastes better over a campfire, aye?  when the great hunter-gatherers of remote coastal alaska brought in the bounty of the days labors, this is likely what they reveled in. when they piled high their wild tundra chocolates, their husks of the rare rainforest coconut, and brought their walrus volks-brot onto a smoking alder blaze, they certainly required a complimentary beverage.  this is it: a coarse libation blending soot, blood-stained elk leather and bitter spruce tea. they danced into the wee hours, gorging and drinking until they collapsed in rapturous inebriation-- or smoke inhalation-- whichever came first. to celebrate those festive days--before moon-barking and barfing were seen as social liabilities, alaskan brewing company brings us this porter just as they found it: leaking out of a rain forest cedar bog, one that was lightning struck and burned a half century ago. but really, this beer is all about the smoke. scrape away that fancy-pants extra touch and youre left with an entry-level porter thats as common on the domestic beer scene as a bowl of peanuts. watery feel, medium flavor, moderate alcohol component, with a somewhat pointed limey expression of hop bitterness. there is the usual lineup of slightly sweet dark malts, lots of predictable coffee and bakers chocolate, plus a luke warm acknowledgement of orchard fruit esters. buy this one for the smoke (its luscious), not the porter, and remember to crack a window.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Bottle of the 2008. I have long been meaning to revisit this one and thank the gods I have. This pours black with hints at red and a tan head floating on top. The aroma is very smoky. I mean, it is almost close to Schlenkerla. Impressive strength in the aroma is imparted by notes of Islay Scotch, that peaty, burning leather character with a dash of iodine. Well done bacon and deep chocolate notes are found in the nose. The palate is medium heavy. Ah, the flavor is amazing. Its very smoky, very sharp. Has almost fish like qualities in the strong meaty flavors followed by hints of cigars, chocolate, crisp bacon fat, ash. I am wowed by the sheer power of smoke. I wish I could get this one more easily. Id buy the crap out of it.

Bottle of the 2016 purchased from a small, newer liquor store in Overland. Its fitting that eight years ago I said Id buy the crap out of this if it were more available. Things have changed since then and Ive a had more than my fair share of this beer and finally decided to make some comments on it again. Ive had this beer in verticals since then and Im telling you, fresh is the way to go. It peaks right around two, three, or five months. This bottle is as good as I can remember ever having it. A full, meaty smoke powers out of the glass. I seem to recall the smoke not being so prominent, but its very assertive and genuine tonight. Its sharp with a well rounded malty backbone suggesting espresso crema, cigars, leather, and brownie crust. The palate is rich and full, as intense as many beers with a considerably higher alcohol content. Hearty smoky flavors hit the palate to conjure up cigars, campfire, smoked salmon, and smoked provolone. The finish is lingering with smoldering, genuine hardwood smoke. Its like a good, fatty piece of bacon. Its a little sharper than beechwood but not so much as peat.  So well rounded, so unique in its approach to smoked malt. Its a classic for a reason. Schlenkerla has hundreds of years experience as an advantage, but Alaskan Brewing has the right idea in setting a template for other brewers to follow.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
523,"2006-03-08",3.9,"2005 651mL Bottle Black as night, with a glow of sodium street lamps on a wet sidewalk. Topped with the creamy puffs of Marshmellow men, tinted by years of pipe tobacco abuse. Aromas are weak, really. No weight, no heft. Merely, an acquiescing puny malt acts as though it could find some limelight amongst the dingy waft of casino carpets. Suddenly and abruptly a fiesta arises in my mouth, surrounded by strands of chile pepper lights and 60-year old Miami men smoking Partagas standing around me, while I snack on fried plantains and empanadas. Someone starts a small fire of juniper twigs in a chimera not far away. All the smokey signals cross, with a dense port-like sensation flowing across my palate. Here, a marriage of smoke and water in the ballet of malt. Its the reduction of hickory smoke in a bundt pan of cane sugars and fine porter malts. Most impressive is the quality of the Porter that dances with the gentle boughs of blistering tundra alders. Silky as a breath of Dunhill smoke from the sharply cut lips of a Swedish artistocrat. Elegant. The pancetta in my pan crisps and like Sugar Rays right, its execution is exacting. Out on the veranda,  a native quietly whispers, ""Bring over more Maple."" A proper rauch respect to the Porter tradition.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
523,"2006-03-05",4.6,"Obtained this 2005 bomber in a trade with BigLove a little while back.  The beer inside was dark brown while pouring and black after settling in the pint glass.  The head atop the opaque body was light beige in color and one finger thick.  While the looks were good, the aroma was otherworldly smoky, underlain by a chocolate smell.  The smokiness was also unmistakable in the taste, but it was far from overwhelming, and permitted chocolaty sweet and lemony sour flavors of a very well made porter come through.  The hops were also present with a citric bitterness.  Mouthfeel was chalky and dry, while still being silky smooth.  No hint of harsh graininess in the aftertaste, just smooth long drawn out smoke.  After tasting this spectacular beer, I wish more brewers would start experimenting with smoked malt.  I would love to get my hands on more, as this would be phenomenal with more age on it, as the layers of flavors merge.  It was still a world class beer as it was.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Flavour of chocolate, roasted malt and a surprising amount of hops (for a Porter) finishes with a nice smoky taste and its all very well balanced.

Ill be honest I dont appreciate the style, but there is definitely a very nice little flavor progression here and you seem to get different aftertatstes based on how large a sip you take.

Wonderful porter taste - all smoke at first, this gives way to a thick sweet porter with lingering burnt notes that mix in with the smoke perfectly.  Some roast in the background as well.  Very little hops present.  Long lingering smoked salmon finish.

Black body with a foamy tan head that fades fast. Very strong aroma of smoke, like a fire pit that has held repeated fires, or the lingering camp fire aroma that clings to clothing after a weekend camping trip. Smokey flavour is far too over the top for my liking, and is paired with a surprising amount of bitterness. Light hints of chocolaty malt are desperate for more recognition but held down by the dominant boorish smoke. Average to medium palate (3+)  Very much not for me. 6-7/3+/5/3/12
December 2005. Bottle, 2004 Vintage. Very dark brown, almost black body. Moderate creamy tan head. Massively smokey aroma is fairly complex compared to the simplicity of some other smoke beers. Smoke in the flavour is not necessarily intense, but is pervasive and dominant, with mildly acrid acidity underlying, and some very distant malt and chocolate making subtle overtures indicating their wish to be invited to the party. Sadly they are firmly but politely rebuffed by the smokey bouncer at the door. Palate is a touch light actually. Nice beer that is not for me.

523,"2005-10-10",3.6,"2004 vintage, I believe. Sampled at the Corkscrew Sunday beer tasting. I thoroughly enjoyed the smokiness and was left wondering why more brewers dont adopt the style. While this is wonderfully smokey, it lacks the backbone to take this to the next level. I think an Alaskan Smoked Imperial Porter would do the trick. Flavor is smoked and roasted with some tobacco and earth richness. I sampled this with a piece of bacon-salt bread and found myself dipping bread into beer. Up the backbone on this beer and youve got me buying this by the case. As is, tasty, but needs more depth.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

2005 bottle on 11/30/06: 55 degrees from cellar... actually a little warm, so second pour from the bomber spent the previous 20 minutes in the fridge. Pours a fabulous black with tan head. Perfect. Nose is much smokier than I remember... in fact, despite my rating, I dont really remember any smoke at all. I hadnt ever had a smoked beer at that point, and, truth to be told, I dont think Id ever really had any smoked foods at all. The aecht beers were a really eye-opener for me towards the beauty that is smoke. ANYway, the freshly popped bottle has wonderful smoke character, though it dies down as the bottle sits. Still some fresh wood, meat, ham, chocolate flavors, on closer inspection. Flavor is chocolatey and smooth, a touch of smoke, pine, bean, whiskey. Dry. A little thin on the palate. A lower rating than my first shot at this beer, though I surely love it just as much. Still waiting to try a super-fresh bottle! 8/5/8/4/16 -- 4.1","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Beer pours into a Corsendonk Christmas glass, a very dark brown, seemilgly jet black liquid with very little, or no head that doesnt stick around long.  The aroma is intensely smoked, with a fishy, raw salmon character - my thoughts of Alaska exactly.  Well, maybe I expected more king crab, but salmon will do.  The strong smoke aroma carries over to the flavor, along with the fishy salmon, but strangely enough, isnt offensive.  The mouthfeel is tingly, and bubbles in the back of the throat going down.  An interesting porter that gave me mental, fishy-salmon images of snow-covered, Alaskan mountains (even in the middle of July).  Sampled heavily chilled, at refrigerator temperature.

523,"2005-07-08",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2005 <font face=""times new roman"">A nearly pitch-black night, save for a low on the horizon sanguine harvest moon.  Soft lights from within the isolated cabin drift out the windows, revealing mounds of dense muddy snow.  A young couple relaxes by the radiating warmth of a smoldering fire.  The kitchen timer dings and the man reluctantly shuffles across the room to pour the now ready coffee.  He takes a few squares of dark chocolate for himself and a stick of licorice for his better half.  While leaving the kitchen a whiff of breakfast from earlier that day crosses his nose; toasted dark bread with prune preserves and peppered sausage.  Returning to his lovers side he places the cups and saucers on a small table adorned with a simple vase containing a mixture of dried wildflowers and herb stems they picked from a nearby field, months ago.  His chocolate tastes bittersweet, made more so by the building dryness in his mouth due to the smoke emanating from the glowing red embers of the fire and the roastiness of his coffee.  Stealing away a bit of the licorice helps balance it all with a subtle sweetness and a tangy zing.  Sipping again, a small frown rolls across his face as he notices the coffee is less oily and more watery, against his preference.  Its not worth the trek back into town, he thinks, as he can surely wait until the streams are gently bubbling again before making that trip.  A gentle hand strokes his shoulder.  Besides, why let that one little detail bother me when so much else is right?Thanks, Whaleman...we should have goblet dueled with them.  22oz bottle, 2004 bottling, snifter.</font>","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

I have not had the patience to let mine age beyond the current vintage in the stores.  My thoughts are the Smoked Porters in general are an underatted delicious style that should only gain in popularity.  The alder smoked malt is incredible.

Very mild aromas, first of bleach(!) until the head dissipates, then dark chocolate and vinous/sour fruit. Flavor is very malty, again chocolately and vinous, and roasted barley. Cola sweetness. I originally gave the beer lower marks for absolute lack of smoke character in flavor and aroma; however, retasting after a few spoonfuls of vanilla ice cream revealed the absolute subtlest, faintest smokiness. Like one molecule of smoke. I doubt I could identify it as a smoked beer in a blind tasting. Full, rich mouthfeel. Sweet coffee and cream aftertaste. Overall tasty, but boring and almost too sweet.

523,"2005-05-23",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2010 2009 Edition - 22 oz. bottle. One of the things I look forward to each year (in terms of beer) is cracking open a new vintage of Alaskan Smoked Porter.  This years edition pours an opaque black with a moderate, somewhat creamy mocha colored head that lasted until mid-glass and left partial lace.  Very pleasant aroma of wood smoke, chocolate, and roasted malt, however, it seems a little more subdued than I recall in previous years.  The flavor is gentle wood smoke along with roasted malt and perhaps a hint of chocolate.  The hops bitterness at the finish is a bit more pronounced than I recall.  Smooth, but again not as smooth as in the past.  Overall, this is still a very good beer, but it just seems to come up a little short in comparison with other vintages.  8-5-8-4-16=4.1 
2008 Edition - 22 oz. bottle. Pours an opaque black with a moderate-large, rich and bubbly mocha colored head that lasted through mid-glass and left a very nice webbing of lace on the glass.  Wonderfully pleasant aroma of wood smoke, chocolate, and roasted malt.  The smokiness and chocolate are well balanced and the smoke does not dominate.  The flavor is more about the wood smoke along with roasted malt with just a few hints of chocolate.  Mild bitterness at the finish.  Smooth on the palate.  2008 is probably one of my favorite vintages thus far.  9-5-8-4-18=4.4 
2007 Edition - 22 oz bottle. Pours a dense opaque black with a moderate-large, rich and bubbly mocha colored head that lasted through three-quarters of the glass and left a thick layer of foam with each sip.  Very pleasant aroma of fireplace smoke along with some roasted malt. The flavor is again smoke, but it is in proper proportion and does not completely dominate. There is some roasted malt and chocolate also present in the flavor. Very mild hops bitterness at the finish is almost an afterthought.  Full bodied.  Excellent beer.
2006 Edition - 22 oz bottle. Pours a a deep, deep dark brown, almost black with a thick, bubbly, mocha colored head.  Very nice smokey aroma, but not overdone. Also some roasted malt. Smoke is also the dominant flavor, but again, not excessive. Roasted malt and a bit of dark chocolate also noted. A bit of a hoppy finish that was more pronounced in this years vintage than I remember in prior years.  Very, very good beer.8-5-8-4-18=4.1
2005 Edition - 22 oz bottle. Like some other folks Im updating my review to include this years offering. Great smokey aroma along with chocolate and malt.  Flavor is incredibly well balanced. The smoke is not at all overwhelming. Slightly sweet roasted malt. Great palate, very smooth. This is truly an excellent beer. I wish I could get this locally and didnt have to mail-order it each year.
2004 Edition - 22 oz. bottle. Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Strong smoke flavor and aroma present along with lots of malt and chocolate. If you are not a fan of smoked flavorings, you wont like this beer. I enjoyed the 2003 edition of this brew and was not disappointed with the 2004. Ive put a few bottles away for aging.

Roasted malt and piney or oaky aromas as well.  Big smokey flavor on top of the roasty, dark fruit flavors and toffee.  I would describe the overtones as more of a smoke cured meat than smoked fish.  Strange to see that in type while at the same time saying that its a really tasty beer.

11/2004 early career rating:
poured a very dark color w/ a dark tan quickly dissapating head.  Smelled of aotmea, coffee and burnt wood.. the burnt scent is initially overpowering but after letting it sit for a couple minutes the smoky scent milds out nicely.  The pal is a little spice and has a nice creamy texture.  The flavor reminded me of eating something next to a campfire it was hard to get past the smoky taste which covered hints of carmel.  Overall this beer was very different than what Im used to and was my first smoked beer.  I think if the smoke taste was calmed just slightly it would be much better.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"

Pretty much the same label except for ""2004"" on top and it now under the ABC logo it states ""Gold Medal Winner: Weve applied the Alaskan tradition of alder-smoking to the malts of this rich, intensely flavored porter, a recognized leader among the worlds smoked beers. Enjoy it now or age it for severeal years."" Oh, and the alcohol is now 6.5% ABV.

This is my first sampling of this fine beer. Fair warning: ""smoked"" is not applied flipantly to this fine beer. If you dont like BBQ, jerky, or out-door cooking, you wont like this, which is fine because then there will be more for us special folks. This is actually my first sampling of this style, so Im going somewhat blind here.

Pours a chocolaty redish brown with nice head and some lacing.

The scent is like I walked into a smoke house; so strong I almost wanted to hold my breath. Very malty other than that.

Taste; and I thought it *smelled* smoky. The smoke almost overwhelms all other tastes, especially for the first few sips. Then the complexity kicks in. This is a great beer. It has all the coffee, toffee, and dark fruits of an awesome Porter with a nice smoky undertone.

Palate is thicker than a typical Porter and still has a bit of a mineral mouthfeel reminicent of Sheaf Stout, but not quite as strong. This is nicely done.

Overall, this is awesome. I will be trying more of this style. I just looked down and realized this is top-rated, which may mean Im ruined for this style, but Im glad I didnt first try crap and then was turned away from ever trying another one.

I would guess the C19th porters were similar, with stout being in a higher alcohol bracket, around 8-9%ABV.

Smokiness hits immediately upon tasting, dry and meaty as an aged steak...mouthfeel thinner in the middle, lightly vinous, with light chocolate and heavy espresso entering to give the finish a huge wallop.  A bit of cherry-licorice slowly develops as the beer warms and a few sips have been had...this is not quite on a par with those amazing Heller Trum beers, but it is a top-notch smoked and a very good porter, and as Im a fan of the style, it gets a high mark from me indeed.

Forget some chocolate over your fireplace, put some bacon to medium fire, cut a slice or 2 of smoked ham, mix it all up and take a big sniff. Its mostly light, pretty much all about the smoke figures, but seems well done and balanced. Body is mostly light with moderate carbonation which could be less intense. Very mild acidity on the tongue, leather, herbal characteristics. This is not as good as Id hope. Dark roasted malt, licorice, molasses, very dry coffee lingers. I must say Im much more keen on the smoke focus in the aroma than the a little of everything on the palate where I lose the fire and woody characteristics that I love. I prefer a calumet or revenante.  2001 aged sample in october 2004. No head, firecamp aroma, bold malt flavors, woody, lightly earthy.

The flavour was much more subtle than the aroma, the smokiness accentuates a well balanced brew with piney hops, grassy flavour and just enough bitterness to finish and round it off.
2003 version
Very dark brown with a thin dissipating tan-coloured head, leaving a ring of foam around the rim of the glass.  Smoky, beeckwood aroma layered over the top of a fairly prominent coffee character.  Flavour however, shows coffee on the front, light acidity which then explodes into a load of smoke on the finish with a lingering bitterness on the finish.  Quite different from the 2002 however, but almost as good.

In the end, the body is meduim(watery character, but still thickish), like a porter ought, but until then it's very stoutish.  I assumed warming would help this beer a lot, but it was really better cold.

523,"2004-03-06",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2007 2006: This year the beer strikes a nice balance between the smoked peat and the roasted malt. Superb.
2004: MUCH more smoke in this one compared to previous vintages. I was expecting the subtle smoke to be gently blended with a rich malty backbone. NO, not this time. 2004 is the year of the rauchbier. Crack the bottle and immediately the fumes of smoked peat hit the nose. Give me a second to adjust because this is not what I was expecting. The smokiness completely dominates the flavor and is thus quite one dimensional. My preference goes to the previous vintages which were much more complex and smooth. Not as smokey as Aecht (thank goodness) but I cant really enjoy much else about this one. But you know what? Its still a damn good beer. Cant wait til next year.
2003: Opaque brown/black in color. Thin brown head sits on top. Lightly carbonated. Aroma is mostly of roasted malt, small bit of smoke can be detected. This beer begins tasting like roasted malt and ends tasting like smoked bacon. This beer is extremely smooth going down. This finish is the best part about this beer.

523,"2004-02-24",4.0,"2003 edition.  I'd been wanting to try this for years, but it just doesn't seem to make it out my way.  Dark stout like brown, good tan head that slowly fades.  Aroma is clearly smoked, quite reminiscent of a smoked cheese, with some bacon qualities.  Flavors are initially of roated malts, some coffee, and then a rapid twist into liquid bacon.  This is very nicely made, clearly smoked yet not totally overpowering.  The bacon notes have my stomach begging for eggs and grits.  It does get to be a bit much by the end of the glass, but this could be killer with food.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

There's a hint of coffee here, as well.  What makes this beer interesting is the dichotomy between its thinness and the strength of its flavors.  This is indeed more of a porter than a stout.

This is not nearly as smoky in the aroma as the 1998 that I just sampled.  It is much fuller and thicker on the palate as well.  It is still quite smoky, but here there is a lot of beer to back up  and balances the smokiness.  This is a nice full beer that is quite rounded.  I must admit that this is much more enjoyable when fresh.  As my palate gets adjusted, I get notes of a sweet malt profile that comes to the forefront.  The finish of this beer dries out considerably because of the pervasive smoke character.
Vintage 2002, Sampled November 20, 2003This beer is one those few, rarely in a life time, mind expanding beers for me.  When I first tried this elixir I was blown away, I was changed forever, and it ultimately lead me to the smoked beer paradise of Bamberg.  This beer will always have a place in my beer sodden soul.Pours a deep dark brown (mostly a black), when roused it produced a dense thick head.  The smoked aroma is immediately apparent as I pour from the bottle to the glass.  There is an aroma of chocolate hidden beneath the smoke.  As I push my lips through the creamy head I get to the elixir beneath.  It is nice & smooth, with definite notes of chocolate and a nice just perceptible pleasing sweetness.  the smoke flavor is not as strong in this slightly aged sample as I remember in fresh versions.  Fairly muted roast character in this porter, the predominant dark malt flavor is of chocolate malt.  The smoke permeates this beer, and it helps to add to a perceived smoothness and a roundness to this beer.  A very well integrated flavor.  this is a classic beer that all beer enthusiasts need to sample at least once.
Vintage 1998, Sampled June 2004
A very smoky aroma wafts from my glass.  This is just intensely aromatic.  The taste reminds me of smoked salmon (sans any fishy component of course).  Any signs of oxidation are clearly not evident, which makes sense as smoke is a good anti-oxidant.  This is much lighter on the palate than when it is fresh.  There is a smooth malty character in the background that is dry and meaty.  The smooth smoke phenolics are dominating in this beer from start to finish.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Thin cocoa brown head that subsides quickly and leaves clear spotty lace. Smell has lots of good sweet roastyness to it, deep and rich, thick sweetened chocolate layered on top of heavily roasted malts, small hops and a hint of smokey woodish earth lightly showing up as it warms with a note of coffee in it. Taste is smooth and roasty sweet, light bitter sweet chocolate, lightly tangy sweet roasted malts. Well rounded and soft, a small amount of hops pleasantly keeps a nice bittering bite and balance over the roasty sweetness. Some coffeeish senses along with a gentle effervescense of smokeyness sneaks its way past the roasty sweetness as well. There's some dark fruity bread chewyness that reminds of a x-mas favorite of mine, a dark marble rye-cinnamon-cherry bread that makes it a pleasing memorable experience for me. Its not overly complex, it has very subtle qualities and when served at the desired warmer temp the smokey characteristics become a bit more noticeable, but never enough to overwhelm. Feel is smooth and creamy, medium, close to full body, lightly chewy aspect with a sticky roastyness covering the tongue and mouth in the finish; my favorite part of this beer, or for any porter for that matter.

523,"2003-04-11",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2003 Now available in Safeway supermarkets in the UK - this award winning and inspirational smoked beer from the Alaskan microbrewery founded in 1986, has proved popular enough to win mass votes for best beer lists on the internet. Malt smoked over alder-wood fires is the key to this beer, and there's a smoke taste for sure, along with a stouty roast malt. The mouthfeel is firm and fat with a little lemon zest. The aroma is soapy at first, then dies away. Flavours can be teased out through the intense smoked malt - an array of fruits that often slip out of reach: now bannana, now strawberry, now lemon. But the combination of all this is dull rather than exciting. A huge, lumbering bear of a beer.

523,"2001-01-16",4.4,"not overpoweing smoke flavor goes well with the texture of a porter, a very drinkable, great tasting brew - try it if you can find it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","zbrew19"

523,"2000-11-22",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2004 The beer after disemboguing from the 22-ounce brown bottle takes its rightful place in my glass an atramentous color with a mastodonic tan head that is spumous in texture and the residual lace a thick coating upon the glass. Nose dominated by the bittersweet aroma of toasted grain, sweet malt at the back, crisp and fresh to the senses, with the start sweet and thick with malt, the top full and rich in its feel to the palate. Finish is masterfully acidic, the hops authoritarian in their spiciness, very dry and long lasting after taste, to me this is one of the top 5 porters in all of Beerdom, hell it might even be number one.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
523,"2000-04-26",4.3,"This is my favorite beer. Ive even stated that fact on my Bio page at http://beer.about.com . For many, its an acquired taste but well worth the effort. In my experience, vintages more than a couple of years old tend to be oxidized. When fresh, this magnificent beer will amaze you. Dont drink it too cold!  Good beers to you.","Duvall, Washington, USA","BeerGuide99"
