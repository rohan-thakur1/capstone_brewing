Sweetish flavour of malt and caramel, with some bitterish roasty and hoppy notes and hints of yeast. Bitter-sweet aftertaste. Soft carbonation.

4179,"2013-03-11",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Bready, caramelized cereals are garnished by citrusy, resinous hops in this bastardized Dunkler Bock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-An endless head of foam follows the cloudy dark red brown.
-The chosen hoppiness (PNW-like) is not that harmonious with the grain bill.
-Mouthfeel is appropriately rich.
-Lightly butterscotchy angles are found.
-Alcohol makes a short appearance alongside the resinous hop bitterness.

4179,"2012-10-17",4.2,"draught at the brewpub. Hazy amber-brown colour, extremely creamy beige head. Looks delicious, the aroma is also promising: very hoppy with some dark malts shining through. Full-bodied with intensive malt flavours that add some sweetness, hints of chocolate and roasted malts and surprisingly: loads of aromatic hops that add tropical fruit, citrus fruit and a resiny touch.
