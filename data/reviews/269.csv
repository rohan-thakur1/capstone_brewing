269,"2011-10-05",3.3,"Rating #150, and my first sake ever! Which means Ill have no idea what Ill be talking about here. I got the bottle from a local ""Vinmonopol"". Batch #006, bottled 05.10.2010, which incidentally means that it was bottled exactly one year ago today (I write this after midnight, so technically its October 6th, but in my mind its still the 5th)!

Beautiful bottle, beautiful label, quite fulfilling for my slightly japanophile side. The bottle has been refridgerated for some days.

So I open the bottle, and pour a bit into a wine glass, since I dont have anything more appropriate for a sake. My cat is curiously watching. There is no carbonation, Im pretty sure that is normal. To me it looks like a white wine. The colour is a very pale yellow.

Aroma: Alcohol and... fruity rice. I think thats the best way I can describe it. At first I get tiny flashbacks to high school and locally produced moonshine, but that quickly passes as I pay more attention. The fruitiness I can only describe as green apples, without the sourness. Smells pretty ""fresh"", like perhaps the smell of an early morning after a heavy rain, a short distance from the fruit garden of a japanese zen temple, if such temples have fruit gardens. 

Taste and palate: Interesting! Different from anything Ive ever tasted. Rather slick/oily mouthfeel. The alcohol is quite present, from start to finish. The flavors start out fruity (the aforementioned green apple flavor) and something else I cant describe. Then, very smoothly, it glides into a very nutty finish (or is it more woody? Im not sure), and I can definitely tell that this has been made with rice. Fruity hints in the finish as well. Slight alcohol burn as I swallow.

Since Ive never had a sake before, Ive got nothing to compare this to, but I must say that I do enjoy this! Theres a strange taste up front which I cant really describe, but it seems connected to the green apple flavor. The mouthfeel is also rather ""foreign"" to me, since its much thicker than a white wine. Im really enjoying the green apple & nut flavors. In addition its a very pleasing experience for the tiny japanophile part of my brain/soul :)","NORWAY","abstractbeer"

269,"2011-03-28",3.0,"Bottle shared at The Trappist.  About as clear as you can get without much color to it at all.  Rice and hints of nuts on the aroma along with booze.  The flavor is mildly sweet and mildly nutty in addition to the rice you expect, with moderate alcohol.  Medium-light body with good crispness.  Not my favorite of Nøgne Øs sakes, but not bad.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

269,"2010-12-04",2.5,"Small coarseish foam disappears immediately. Hazy nearly clear greenish body. Fruity mineraly sugary aroma with alcohol and oil notes. Dry-sweet alcoholic herbal fruity taste with grape notes. Mid-bodied. Sharpish mouthfeel initially, then intensely hot at the end. Dryish mineraly fruity aftertaste is sort of faint. Well. Its not at all bad, but theres just way too much in-your-face alcohol for me. (0.35l bottle, wine monopoly.)","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"
269,"2010-11-01",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2012 Bottle. Its a clear, slightly yellowish sake, flat and headless. Theres some booze on the nose, some citric acidity too, its quite fruity and with a sort of pleasant rice aroma. The flavor has a certain acidity, with rice and fruityness in a quite pleasant blend. Warming, medium to full body and dry, finishing with fruits and rice. A rather nice one, but I have to admit I have a long way to go to fully appreciate sake. Rating: 6-3-6-3-12-3.0. 100611Bottle, #015. A clear, lighlty yellowish sake, lightly oily pours. Apples, melon, a generic fruityness, hints of alcohol and a faint note of rice. Oily, full-bodied and warming in the mouth. Lots of fruityness, some alcohol notes and a touch of cooked rice. Lasting finish. Certainly an improved edition of Junmai-Shu. 121126","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

269,"2010-09-30",2.6,"Bottle, from Vinmonopolets web shop. My first thought is: how come Im rater no. 3 on this sake? Its been around since the summer now; are people really that ""beerservative"" that they dont support our best microbrewerys attempt at branching out? I sure as hell do, despite the fact that I dont really have a very good track record for sake and still consider my self as acquiring the taste... Pours a pale, clear straw yellow body. Nose is starched rice, alcohol and hints of honey and almonds. Taste is surprisingly mild; at first I dont feel a thing. Then, slowly at first, comes a warming alcohol feel accompanied by subtle flavors of rice, smooth yeasty tones and some nuttiness that I cant quite put my finger on. This is actually surprisingly nice; not in a flavor-rich kinda way but in the lightness and subtlety of the palate and aromatic profile. Still, Im not totally sold on sake yet, but this is by far one of the best Ive had.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
