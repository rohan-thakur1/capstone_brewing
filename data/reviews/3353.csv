More fruit aromas (pineapple, lemon). Flavour brings much more grapefruit and pine/herbal - bitterness presents itself before dissipating to a delicate linger that is also fruity, with that light pine note. Somewhat juicy, before a crisp finish, yet that sweet maltiness in the middle supported by the hop fruitiness. Paired in an interesting way with a peppery salad and goats cheese.
