 Kolor:  Czarny, zupełnie nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Drobniuteńka, zwarta jak na azocie.
Idzie do góry w maksymalnie szybkim tempie.
Pęka do średnich oczek.
Gruba oponka wisi nad piwem.
Na krawędziach TeKu pozostawia liczne firanki.
Piana maluje całą powierzchnię szkła. 
 Zapach:  W aromacie pierwsze klimaty to zderzenie z silną czekoladą.
Jest też lekko palony klimat oraz odrobinę słodów w postaci przypalonego karmelu.
W tle subtelne orzechowy nuty.
Pachnie niczym nie jeden lekki Imperial Stout. 
Tak na prawdę według BJCP wszystkie Stouty od 8% w górę powinny być klasyfikowane jako Imperial Stouts. 
 Smak:  Smak złożony i nietypowy.
Na sam początek piwo pokazuje dość wysoki profil owocowy (czarne porzeczki) i inne ciemne owoce.
Później już klasyka stylu: czekolada, ale taka nadziewana owocami (wiśnie, czarne porzeczki), kawa mocno osłodzona i kapka melasy.
Alkohol świetnie zatuszowany.
Niska tekstura, gładkie odczucie na języku.
Ciekawy FES / Imperial Stout.
Długą drogę musiało przejść to piwo zanim trafiło na mój stół. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie.  

 Podsumowanie:   

Lion Stout - piwo ze Sri Lanki. Tropical Stout uwarzony w Kambodży w rozmiarze 0,66l.

Fajny FES, w zasadzie może nawet Session RIS, jeśli takie pojęcie w ogóle istnieje.
Wszystko stylowo i w klimacie mocnego stouta.
W zasadzie wszystko gra i buczy. Jedyne zastrzezenie mam do wodnistej tekstury. Poza tym gites ;-)))","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

1945,"2017-02-10",5.0,"Ce lion est un véritable jaguar. En effet cette stout de la brasserie Lion se démarque par ses lignes épurées, distinguées mais racées, qui peuvent se comparer aux lignes des plus belles sportives de luxe et plus particulièrement à une Jaguar. Et sans être ni dune complexité ni dune corpulence extraordinaire, sa ligne gustative, autour du café est à la fois dune telle pureté, dune telle finesse et dune telle précision quelle rentre aisément dans la catégorie des grandes bières. Sorti de son écrin, notre stout est dun noir intense (EBC aux alentours de 79) surmontée dune mousse brune nappant tout juste la bière. Le nez est à la fois intense et raffiné. Le café, pur, se mélange subtilement aux arômes de prune relevés dune pointe de cognac. De toute beauté! Lattaque nous permet de découvrir la base principale de ce Lion : des arômes de café grand cru, expresso, secs et intenses, à la fois simples et gracieux. La seconde bouche gagne en rondeur en laissant apparaître le chocolat, se parant subtilement de notes de fruits des bois pour conférer une très belle profondeur aux arômes. Larrière bouche continue quant à lui sur le café, fil conducteur de notre dégustation. Dailleurs celui-ci reprendra les devants en troisième bouche, poussé par lamertume, peu intense mais permettant de relever de façon juste les arômes avant darriver au final, de grande classe, très long où le cognac se marie de façon somptueuse au café pour une alliance, classieuse, riche et intense. Léquilibre sucre, alcool (8,8 % Abv) malt et houblon est simplement parfait. Une stout que tout zythologue doit avoir dégusté. Ce lion est dune grande classe.","FRANCE","jybi"

Like sweet licorice and cocoa powder and coffee, plus some ashiness and earthy notes. Tastes sweet, dark dried fruits like figs and dates, also pears? But the licorice familiar from aroma is distracting, the aniseed appears minty fresh on the tongue which I find a bit strange but then again, it might work well in Sri Lanka heat.

Its a Stout, a strong one at that, when youd expect a Lager. Its cheap. In fact, this beer has the best Taste to Price to Strength ratio going for it that I have ever encountered. Black with a tan head, bold notes of licorice, tobacco, raisins, wood, leather, smoke and molasses mingle magnificently for nose and tongue. Slight hints of booze rear up but only as a stern warning; this beer is delicious, but strong...dont mess with it. As a warming effect enters after a few sips, I find myself enjoying the slick body with more than typical carbonation for a Stout. Its big, bold and buck-bangin bodaciousness in a bottle.

Its a blacker than sin with a covering of greyish brown head and aromas of coffee, charcoal, cola nut, carob (I hate carob), dusty cocoa and dessicated coconut. This comes through in a rich flavour contained in a body that suggests that this beer is not to be trifled with.

Taste has some hop bitterness and malt maltiness in the beginning, mixed with aged wine flavours - but then other taste layers come out and a fruit garden is exposed. Some dark dried fruits, cherries and raisins give way to a lingering dry and even somewhat nutty aftertaste. It lasts several minutes.

1945,"2013-08-10",4.5,"330 ml bottle bought at AJs Sri Lankan Cuisine in Sai Kung.
Colour: Deep blackish brown with dirt-like yeast sediments.

Looks: One finger head and coffee-like beige foam which last for about 1 minute. Small sticky lacing with notable carbonation.

Aroma: Quite fragrant roasted malt, with coffee, raisin, vanilla, dark fruits, ginger, Jasmine-like floral and molasses.

Taste: Sweet and pleasant roast malt, with toffee, light black coffee, strong ginger, strong spice, nuts, smoke, light liquorices, pretty strong grass and hops. 

Body: Mid to light, with slick and slightly creamy palate. 

Mouth Feel: Very solid stout base - good roasted malt, very nutty, toffee and coffee are moderate and in right doses. Surprises being the ginger and Jasmine-like elements, making this brew very fragrant and fresh both in smell and taste, make me say wow! a few times already.

Booze: The 8.8% abv is very well-hidden all the way and has no knock-on throughout. Incredible!

Hoppiness: Mostly on the nose - pleasant flower and grass plus some citrus, and bitterness is moderate for a FS, sapping and slightly lingering for a finish. Quite nice.

After Taste: Slightly dry, nicely spicy to mouth.

Comments: This one is highly praised by many, and for me this really is a nice surprise: I was expecting a really heavy stout; Instead, its moderate body and taste is massively boosted by some very nice ginger / flower / spicy elements to make it very enjoyable and interesting. I know Ill back to AJs very soon to stock some more for the winter. Highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

1945,"2013-05-23",4.5,"33cl bottle via CH, merci vielmals an Allen for this surprise haul. - Meant to save this for a special occasion, but then the coldest days of end of May arrived and stayed. Truly spectacular beer both in its ""wise"" balance and boldness of taste, apparently juggling UK, CZ, DK, A aka Old Europe ingredients with postcolonial ease (by virtue of an ""English yeast strain"", which must have prefered to secede from the UK for the occasion).  Tar black (added colorant) with confident beige adhesive foam, contained malty and roast-acidic aroma: getting a lot of precarious road in this. Taste is a suavely shifting Rorschach of dark chocolate bitter, charcoal tartness, malt cream, upfront liquorice (usually not a fan), toasted caramel, old figs/prunes and assertive hop spice. Lingering charred and slightly briny aftertaste (despite the 3,500 ft above sea level). None of the near 9% apparent, nor does the added sugar make this less dry.  World-class, deserving of Micheal Jacksons effigy on the back label.

1945,"2013-03-01",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2013 Bottle purchased in Sydney (Australia, not Nova Scotia), as Sinha Stout. Sinha and Singha both derive from a Sanskrit word सिंह, meaning Lion. Isnt that cool? Two famous beers from countries where there are no lions as part of the native fauna. To be fair, there was probably a lion in pre-historic Ceylon  now Sri Lanka, but it is believed to have been extinct before the arrival of humans andwhere were we? Sinha! Yes, I had all reasons to be excited before tasting this historical beer. Sinha is a gorgeous stout, indeed one of the best ones. Black as the lion mane on the label, it has a firm tan head that dissolves into a rather charming lacing. Wonderful aromas of chocolates, plums and bourbon barrels. The alcohol is high, but quite well hidden behind the smoothness of those dark chocolates, the espresso (but not too much, not to worry), the fruitiness. I could not precise specifically the fruits, but that basket full of them  red, bluish, plump and yummy fruits  was dancing around my head as the chocolates kept seducing my senses. There is a milky texture, almost as a sweet stout, but never too suave or too delicate. It is a LION stout after all! It comes with a non-tangible sharpness that breaks through the mellow flavours. As the beer spreads horizontally throughout the palate, smoky, woody  still the woods from those bourbon barrels  a nice and subtle bitterness raises vertically along both sides of the tongue, granting a grand finale to the sip. This is a firm and lustrous product, it comes with tradition, solid and seductive as a well-polished teak floor in a colonial property of old Ceylon.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"

1945,"2013-01-10",4.2,"330ml Bottle from The Cave, Glasgow:
Rich malts to begin along with a strong, dark chocolate aroma that is also quite rich and hints at some sweetness along with some sugar and a bit of cocoa. There is some darker fruits present, notably cherries and there is also some roasted malts and a faint amount of alcohol towards the end.

Deep, mahogany brown on closer inspection. It is topped with a foamy, light brown coloured head about half a centimetre tall which manages to hold very well indeed, particularly for the strength of the beer; it barely budges other than a very slight initial reduction of no more than a millimetre.

A nice mix of cherries and various other darker fruits. There is also a good blend of rich malts, chocolate and sweet, roasted malts that are pretty well balanced and seem to work well together. I also seemed to taste a slightly milky flavour somewhere near the middle and some slight bitterness right at the end.

Medium in body, slightly tangy and with a nice fruity character. There is medium to high carbonation and a nice amount of alcohol lingering in the background too.

Quite an unusually fruity stout but a very nice one nonetheless with a lot going on, especially with the depth of character in the smell. This one is certainly up there with the best stouts I have tried to date.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

1945,"2012-12-27",3.1,"Reviewed 12/25/2012. 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark red color with nice opacity. The head is a huge, foaming three finger khaki color that descends to one finger after a while. Plenty of lacing is left behind, as well.

S: Big, massive, hugely sweet chocolate. Some dark fruits, as well. Actually, come to think about it, theres a minor whiff of sour cherries - infection, perhaps? We shall see. I still enjoy the aroma greatly, but that foamy head should have been a giveaway.

T: The flavor takes on more of a roasted barley and coffee bean tone, especially at first, while waves of chocolaty sweet and - unfortunately - tart cherries seemingly via an onsetting infection. After a while, the tartness takes center stage. Some herbal hop flavors also try to pop up in the finish, as well. So what we have here is a lightly soured stout, and it kind of works. Not perfectly by any means, but theres enough sweetness here to keep it in check.

M: Quite light in its loafers with wimpy carbonation. Theres actually an esophageal burn and a bit of stomach turning which completely tanks the mouthfeel score for me. On the palate proper, its not particularly dry, but nicely bittersweetnsour; whatever the blue hell thats supposed to mean.

O: Infected - it just has to be. But thank Odin its a minor infection that actually gives it a pleasant twist, instead of twisting my mouth sideways and dissolving my tongue. This clearly isnt the final product as its intended to be - thankfully I have a penchant for a good Flemish-style ale along side my stout tooth, so I still think its quite okay.

Aroma:  Mocha, raisins, figs, vanilla, toffee, chocolate, heaven?
Flavour:  Delicious deep malt complexity, chocolate and toffee, port like finish, accented with alcohol.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, velvety, a noticeable raspy carbonation that is not astingent at all.  Lovely balance between hop and malt.  Long malty finish  with a lingering warming alcohol kick.
Overall: One of the best stouts on the market for me.  Very consistent.","","Hateball16"
1945,"2012-12-05",3.5,"11.2oz Bottle. The pour was a murky pitch black with an average (1-2 finger) chocolate shake brown creamy head that was mostly diminishing, down to a thin film and medium collar that pretty much lasted throughout and had good sticky lacing.

The aroma was of a roasted dark malt, mild resin hops and a leathery yeast with notes of chocolate, dried dark fruit (prunes) and a nice mild alcohol tinge.

The taste was very malty and just a tad sweet with a hint of chocolate early on, then progressed with a mild bitterness, a touch of dark fruit and a bold coffee note towards the finish. The flavor hung on for a decent duration after the swallow with a smooth choco-coffee taste and a mild alcohol warming sensation at the end.

Mouthfeel was medium in body with a thin oily texture and a medium carbonation.

Overall this was a nice a roasty brew, although I did find it to be just a little thin for a stout it did possess very nice taste and a great drinkability...","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

Aroma:  Lovely date, prune, raisin, and  tobacco aroma.  Very light hop spice. While the dark roasted malt is dominant in the aroma, the hop spice comes through.

Taste: Again with the wonderful date, prune, raisin, and tobacco flavors.  But there is also a chocolate flavor.  And again the hop spice comes through.  Its difficult to pinpoint any particular hop flavor but it is definitely there.  There are so many complex flavors in this beer.  It is so complex.

The bottle I had was marked at 8.8%, but I only realised as I was perusing the label. You really cant tell the high alcohol content from the label. I was really shocked at how fruity this beer was.

They give way to a smooth and sweet treacle taste, which moves into a body of mild coffee and cocoa. Some slightly more bitter cocoa asserts itself in the finish. This is a pretty decent stout.

Chewy full, sweet & spicy malts, liquorice, chocolate & a balancing dry roasted maltiness. Dark chocolate & roasted malt in the finish. Medium to full body-wise, medium carbonation, a lingering bittersweet finish of choc & ashy, smoky, roasty malts. Quite firm in the mouth.

Lots of coffee and chocolate sweetness. Body is not overcarbonated. Alcohol burns a bit. Body is solid and not at all water.

Aroma is great and stout-like, as expected...faint coffee, apparent dark chocolate AND cocoa, and interesting layers of roast malt.  All is well at this point, cruising toward a 4.0+ rating, then the first sip.  Perhaps this is what they call ""English yeast strain"" but I think its sour and infected, which is a huge letdown.  Other standard flavors are there with some depth from the foreign malts and a touch of liquid smoke, but the funky twang at the finish ruined the whole experience for me.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

1945,"2011-07-29",4.3,"Pours a thick, jet black with a massive coffee and cream head that bubbles away slowly leaving intricate lace patterns on the glass. This is a beer best poured slowly with an un-tilted glass or it will not produce much head. Nose is extremely sweet and rich. On the nose are coffee, burnt coffee bean, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, vanilla ice cream, caramel, brown sugar, and soya sauce. Mouthfeel is thick and with medium carbonation. The taste is strong in every respect. Sweetened coffee, and dark chocolate are most evident at first, as well as roasted malts and Russian black bread. There is also a distinct dark fruit, almost sherry note of black cherries and raisins, as well as some whisky and soya sauce. Further tasting reveals a fair bit of wood smoke and some nuttiness, strengthening the whisky note.  Finish is long, dry and sour, leaving grapes, cherry, dark chocolate, and coffee beans lingering on the palate for a good while. Its only weakness is that there is a strong booziness to this beer, thanks in part to its high alcohol content, but it is easily compensated for by its rich taste. Its interesting to note that when finishing a glass, I frequently notice small, brown spots sticking the bottom which look a lot like chocolate. Either way, this is a delicious and dark stout at an incredible price, and the stout that got me into stouts.","Ontario, CANADA","C2H5OH"

1945,"2011-06-20",3.9,"I poured a 12oz bottle into an English stout glass.Appearance: Black as spent motor oil and totally opaque. Forms a large, frothy/creamy head which retains and laces very well.Smell: Black licorice and a slightly tangy, almost sour dairy scent in the nose. I was worried my bottle was expired.Taste: While the aroma had me a little anxious, I was quickly and pleasantly relieved after taking the first swig. This is what I look for in a good imperial stout. The first half is strong with rich sweetness - especially black licorice, and the second half delivers a strong bitterness of deeply roasted malts with a quick burst of dark chocolate. As the beer warms the palate really begins to develop with even more sweet flavors of toffee and caramel in the beginning. Theres a faint sourness on the finish, but it actually works with the palate, surprisingly enough. Mouthfeel: Thick, soft and tepid with a velvety smoothness.Drinkability: Weighing in at 8% ABV, Lion Stout doesnt have the overwhelming hubris you might expect in beers like this. There is no alcohol present in the aroma or taste and drinking one is satisfying, and not a challenge. The soft mouthfeel enables the beer to slide across the tongue and down the hatch like water. Overall, a very impressive stout especially considering it hails from an obscure country not known for its beer. Many American brewers could something from this brew.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1945,"2011-03-14",3.7,"Hard not to like this beer when you learn the story behind it.  And there are far, far worse stouts out there on the domestic side of the aisle.  Lion Stout doesnt present much of a nose, nor does the somewhat sparkly mouthfeel complement the depth of flavor to be found.  Yet these subtle flaws are easily overlooked once the smoky-sweet malts ooze across your tongue.  Chocolate and toffee roll over a modestly hopped finish, yet rather than turning into yet another mocha-tinged stout, Lion picks up mild notes of leather and peppery alcohol.  

Its incredibly easy to take Lion Stout for granted;  you never remember it being as good as it is until you open the occasional bottle or can.  Sure, the ABV and slowly emerging sweetness dont really set you lusting for another pint, but the one you do drink is worth savoring.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

1945,"2011-03-12",2.9,"First impressions are good.  There is a mystique to this stout resulting from its complex mocha flavor.  However, after a few sips, one becomes quickly convinced that this will be the last Lion Stout of the night.  The stout begins to show a licorice quality.  It sticks to ones throat and winds up tasting more like medicine than a drinkable beverage.","USA","wbradley82"

1945,"2011-02-01",4.0,"Pours black as night, with a light tan head that laceswell and dissapates to a one finger static cap. Smells boozy, and sweet, possibly of raisins and molasses. Cant detect much else, but raisin sweetness is very strong. Taste is of very toasty malt chocolate, with that molasses in the background, and a little bit of bitterness in the finish. Quite pleasing and clean for the style, and really nicely sweet at the beginning of the sip. 8.8% abv makes itself known just a little bit in the breath initially, and helps the flavor out a lot. Coffee hints in the after-swallow breath, which is nice. Mouth feel is tingly and thick, and drinkability is not fantastic due to the abv and boozy taste, but still pretty good for the style.

The chocolate is there but it is a dry cocoa taste and the sweetness seems to be a bit of dark fruit. The aftertaste is perfect. Dry and clean, and the alcohol is not very noticable.
This beer feels great in my mouth perfect bubbles that coat the tongue and clense the palate. A great Beer to pair with dessert (making my store bought vanilla cookies 10 time better!)

The creamy mouthfeel helps, as well.  This beer has a lot of roasted malt character and manages also to be refreshing.  Great stuff.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

The nose is well balanced between chocolat, molasse, caramel and some coffee. The taste is the same, very well-balanced with some coffee, cocoa and molasse.

The malts taste a little more like caramel than expected, and the hops add a nice dimension as well.  On the palate, this beer is actually lighter than expected, due in large part to the heavy carbonation.  The finish is not terribly long.

1945,"2010-04-16",3.5,"12oz Can. Pours nearly black with almost no light passing through. Solid tan head fell fairly quickly. Aroma really reminded me of Guinness, which is rarer than you would think. Some chocolate notes though, and a subtle underpinning of tobacco and coffee. Pleasant but not super impressive overall. Taste had some smokiness for me, almost meaty on the front, the middle was fairly mild, nothing distinguishing honestly. The finish is nice though, long and meandering from straight malt to chocolate to coffee and other roasty flavors. Palate is pretty light considering, and alcohol is well balanced. Carbonation seems fine as well. Overall a very quaff-able stout that is light enough to get through a few of probably, but not interesting enough to necessarily want to.

Flavor is smooth chocolate with some middle notes of tobacco before a fruity, moderately dry finish.  This is quite drinkable and thankfully the sweetness is held in check.

Very drinkable beer with an awesome bottle. It only has one downfall. The aftertaste. Its not bitter or even dry. Its very prevelent. It almost seemed like a teriyaki or some other Asian flavor to it. This is different and makes it stand out against other similar stouts but it does not seem to match with the rest of the taste.

1945,"2009-11-24",3.6,"Serving date: 2009-02-01. Served in snifter.

330 ml bottle with freshness date printed on the bottle (Best before September 2009).

The pour is basically jet-black - held up against the light it reveals only small deep red hues. The liquid seems clear. The head is about 3 cm - bigger than expected and certainly bigger than many stouts - and its color is one shade darker than your ordinary cappuccino. Its a very thick and creamy head - almost reminiscent of a nitro-carbonated brew - and it stays for a while before settling into a ring of lacings. I must say, this beer looks very good.

Some quite powerful aromas of dark fruits - mostly black currants - and milk chocolate hit the nose. Plenty of roasted malts and coffee are there as well. A faint nutty aroma - perhaps of cashew nuts of almonds - finishes off the smell, which I enjoyed quite a bit, of this one.

In the taste, more dark fruits and notes of ripe red apples blend with molasses for a big sweet flavor. Roasted malts are also rather assertive. There is also a somewhat unusual chocolate character present - consisting of a mix of both bitter and sweet chocolate flavors. In the slightly bitter finish, there is a small twang from the alcohol, a sweet taste of toffee and gentle hops. Towards the end, when the beer warms up, the chocolate flavor becomes more prominent. Overall, this one tastes good, but not extraordinary. It has a nice balance between some of the usual flavors found in a stout, and some flavors are even quite big and powerful - almost trying to enter the domain of imperial stouts.

Heavier on the carbonation and a bit livelier than I had anticipated. Semi-full (not medium though) body. Towards the end, it gets a little smoother.

This is a very good beer, but as already noted, not extraordinary. It looks and smells really good - the smell actually outweighs the taste, which is a bit of a disappointment. Somehow, it feels smaller than it actually is - the alcohol hides really well - but I dont know whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. However, irrespective of this, its highly recommended and I would definitely try it again if it was offered to me, but I wouldnt make any huge efforts trying to get a hold of it.

Initial is roasty, smooth yet tasty, lighter bodied than anticipated, a bit of smooth cream and sweeter chocolate, a touch of coffee, Irish soda bread.

1945,"2009-10-16",3.5,"33 cL bottle. Time to tick another little dot on my Geo map. The label back shows Michael Jackson drinking some stout from a snifter, so I got out my tulip glass.

A bit of cocoa and the sourness of an English style stout. Chocolate is mostly in the nose throughout this glass. Sourness builds, but never about the level expected for the style, which I call ""cherry cordial."" Alcohol is well subdued. Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy for a beer thats best experience on cask or nitro. Some yeast in bottom of bottle, probably not enough to easily culture (but I have to consider the possibilities).

Very smooth and creamy and has just enough bitter roast to balance the sweetness well, but is slightly sticky.","Washington, USA","Beerona97"
1945,"2009-06-15",3.5,"Pours black, as any good stout should. Nice tan head that fades rather quickly, very modest lacing.  Immediately upon opening there is a strong molasses/soy smell. Seemed odd to me and was a little put off. As it warmed this calmed down to more burnt malt with an ""old coffee"" undercurrent. Smell may still be a possible drawback to some.  Tastes like sweet chocolate with alcohol at the back. It was very light and smooth. Seems slightly thin for the 8% as the alcohol is subtly apparent in each sip. Still, flows nicely over the tongue.  I could easily have a few of these.

Final thoughts: Picked this up since it was cheap and am not disappointed at all. I think I poured it too cold which I believe contributed to the almost overpowering initial aroma. In future I would let this warm slightly before serving as it certainly improved.

Different than other stouts Im used to drinking and a nice change which I would purchase again, although only occasionally.","Tennessee, USA","Brianito"

The dark brown crown was a little short but did leave behind some nice roapy spotty lacing.

1945,"2009-02-04",4.2,"Lion Stout brewed by Lion Brewery (Ceylon) http://www.lionbeer.com/
Beer Style:  Foreign Stout

4 out of 5 on over all drink-ability

625ml in a 12 oz bottle, 8.0% ABV

Aroma:  A pleasant medium strength aroma of fruity esters with strong notes of dried fruits.  Rather pleasant, thought I would like aroma to be a little stronger.

Appearance: Pours deep rich black with a tan head.  The beer clings to the class.  When the head dissipates it leaves the top of the beer clear and smooth, reminiscent of a deep mountain lake at night.

Flavor:  The initial taste is light with smooth roaster grain, malts, and coffee and first.  The after taste lingers while the flavors intensify.

Mouth feel: It has a thick, rich and luxurious feel in the mouth.  There is a light bite on the lip and tongue.  The carbonation starts out strong but dissipates quickly improving the lush feel of the beer.

Overall Impression:  It is very easy to drink; when the bottle was gone I was wishing I purchased a second bottle.  The flavors are strongest in the after taste, as they should be in a beer you wish to remember.","Kansas, USA","mrbirmingham"

1945,"2008-08-20",2.7,"Pours into my 25cl tulip glass with a dense, creamy, initially four-finger thick, deeply brown stained, full tan colored head.  The beer is a full black color that shows just a flash of ruby to it when held up directly to the light.  Weird, the aroma is quite weird; buttery, but with an almost chemical undercurrent.  What is weird is that this might not be diacetyl, this is the most likely culprit, but for some reason it just seems a bit different than your typical diacetyl signature.  Buttered popcorn aromas clearly dominate, but there is just a hint of roast character noticeable towards the finish.

Quite sweet with a fairly agreeable flavor until the finish which has a phenolic, chemical edge to it.  The body has a nice fullness to it as well as a nice soft, chocolate tasting, roast grain flavor to it.  That strange buttery note is not nearly as noticeable in the flavor, but the chemical note still manages to mute my enjoyment of this beer pretty significantly.

This is newly arrived in Arizona, so I don’t understand why this is so bad; and to be honest the flavors of this beer seem pretty fresh, it is just that there are also some significantly off components to this beer as well.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1945,"2008-07-06",4.3,"THOUGHTS: Well, apparently Sri Lankan beer rocks! I always thought this was the Lion beer from Jamaica. This is great. Hid alcohol well too. A nice stout that amazingly isn’t too heavy to drink in summer’s heat. I still haven’t met a foreign stout I didn’t like. This is a little smokier than the others, so it’s different in some ways, but similar in the best ways to the other great foreign stouts. I want more but only bought a single bottle.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was opaque black in the glass with a small, tan head that fully diminished but left good lacing. The aroma was roasted, chocolate, cocoa and mild coffee malts, smoke soy sauce, a little salt, and tobacco. There was more and more smokey soy as it warmed. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, bitter and a little salty; while the finish was moderately sweet, lightly acidic and bitter, and somewhat salty with an average duration. There was hot cocoa powder, some smokiness, then some coffee and roasted malt. The medium body was oily with fizzy carbonation and a light astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Thick mouthfeel, low carbonation.  Flavour is sweeter than the average stout, not very bitter, with a touch of molasses.  Not overly roasty, but certainly quite rich.  Doesnt show the alcohol, by any means.  An interesting stout: wont be my standard, but its a nice changeup.","Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","Illuminatus"

Overtones of prunes and lesser molasses.  Not too sweet, as others have noted; I actually find this to be rather well-balanced.  Very crisp carbonation on a full body, but seems creamier with passing sips.  As for the alcohol, the body is there but the burn is not.

Been looking for this one for quite some time--fun to finally get to try it. I have to give this a bonus points for having a good story; the treacherous mountain journey to get ingredients to the brewery.

The aroma was reminiscent of malt, chocolate, and coffee.  The mouthfeel is thick with mild carbonation.  The flavour was very good, some malt and coffee hints.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

Also tones of sweet liquorice, leather, suede, cellar, mushrooms, horse light smoke and dark fruits like plums and raisins. Some sugary hint of molasses, brown sugar and caramel. A light alcohol warmth.  Nice chocolate flavour with tones of brown sugar, liquorice and dark, dried fruits. Some coffee and raisins in the finish. A bit vinous.  Soft, silky and round mouthfeel with a gentle carbonation. Light bitter and some light acid tones. Medium full body. I cant remember this leather/suede/cellar/ mushrooms nose from previous samples of this beer but its probably a vintage question. Anyway, nice and rather complex.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"

Aroma is mocha sweetness, chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is a little smokey up front, then comes the mocha, finishes with the chocolate, and then the alcohol and bitter dark chocolate comprise the after taste. Mouthfeel is oily and a tad rough around the edges, but over-all actually kind of smooth. The smokey malts seem to carry on the whole way through. This is definitely an interesting and complex brew. Theres enough flavour here to mask the 8% alcohol which is for sure a plus. I think I would need more than 330ml in steaming hot weather to really fully appreciate this stout though.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

1945,"2007-06-23",3.1,"Bottle.  With all of the excellent reviews out there, this surprised me a bit.  Poured clear and black with a medium beige head.  The aroma was black cherries, roasted malt, and some dark chocolate.  The flavor opens with much of the same, but is quickly overtaken by metal.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin.

1945,"2007-06-18",4.1,"After months of teasing maybe next week promises, Nav finally conjured the sought-after Lion from his cricket bag. And it was worth the wait. Glugs inkily into the snifter an impenetrable pitch, creamily heaped cappuccino suds receding to a slick. A dribble-inducing waft of black cherry, soy, chocolate liqueur, malt whiskey, Marmite, resiny hop spice and charred barrelwood arises. This is a special beer before youve even tasted it. Mouth is drinking chocolate-thick, deep, bittersweet and satisfying, with a chocolate complexity that is one moment powdery and sweet, the next packed with 80% cocoa bitterness. Creamily smooth but warmingly boozy. Lingering tobacco, charcoal and Marmite afters. Big, bittersweet, creamy and dangerous. Im not being greedy but I really need a crate of 625ml bottles to get to the bottom of this beer.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
1945,"2007-06-15",3.9,"Pours dark with a thick tan head that is pretty well formed.  Aroma is earthy malts.  It definitely has some chocolaty notes.  Initial flavor is sweet with some light bitterness mixed in.  The finish is a powdery chocolate..dry on the tongue with some bitterness like baking chocolate, but still primarily the earthy sweet flavor.  There is some spice flavoring if you swish it around your mouth, but it is quickly overtaken by the muting dirt taste (not unpleasant).

1945,"2007-06-11",2.9,"Maybe I had a bad bottle but I really didnt like this beer as much as everyone else has seemed to.  Previously I had only known this beer as the one with Michael Jackson on it but later found out that it is actually one of the highest rated foreign stouts out there.  And for a mere $2.99 for a 625ml who can complain.  Appearance was opaque black with large tan head.  Aroma is sweet like cherries, but overall the aroma is not very strong.  Flavor is sweet/sour like guiness but with a a more roasted/burnt malt and somewhat smoky with a slight bitterness.  Body was very thin and slightly carb.

1945,"2007-06-09",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2010 Appearance: Standard black stout color with creamy beige head. Minimal head retention and lacing.

Smell: Sweet roasted maltiness with a definite waft of alcohol and a hint of raisin. All with a real dank mustiness to it. Huh. 

Taste: Initially, a distinct smack of malt sweetness hits the tongue, supplanted by vanilla and plums. Finishes dry, similarly to a cup of coffee.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, though still a bit lighter and lacking the fullness that I both crave and demand! Carbonation is rather low, allowing the beer to achieve some creaminess.

1945,"2007-05-25",4.2,"So, I must admit, I am a bit prejudiced against import beers that come from a country without a substantial brewing tradition.  IMO, most of those beers are that countrys version of Heineken or Budweiser, so I was a bit skeptical about this beer, and I passed up opportunities to try it more than once.  And this was a grave mistake, as this beer is truly excellent.  This is far and away the best imported stout Ive had, and better than the vast majority of its American counterparts as well.

I noticed Michael Jacksons photo was right on the label, so I knew it was good.  Appearance was an inky black, with lots of fluffy white head which agggressively stuck around.  Aroma was chocolatey, with abundant alchol or maybe bourbon esters.  I noticed the mouthfeel before the flavor:  the bottle conditioning MJ pointed out on the label made this beer velvety smooth.  Flavor was very chocolatey and roasty and dry and delicious!  Highly recommended.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

1945,"2007-03-26",3.8,"Pours a dark dark brown to sort of black with a healthy tan head, reducing to a thin head over time.  The nose is big and enticing.  More chocolate and roast than fruit as with others of the style Ive had.  Something slightly creamy, and definitely a bit of cinnamon and maybe fennel and chicory.  The mouthfeel is nice, but not overwhelmingly thick and creamy, low subtle carbonation.  The flavors really shine.  In line with the aroma, but more broad and robust.  A big sweet roasty malt backbone with that chicory flavor as well as some definite hop presence.  Alcohol barely there, but much more dominant than the slightest fruity flavors.  A bit of bittersweet chocolate with a slight bit of fruit and cinnamon in the finish and a lingering roast in the aftertaste.  Only then the alcohol becomes noticeable.  A bang-up beer, if only I could get it in these parts.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

A nicely built beer with an aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, sweet malts and perhaps a touch of dirt. Appearance is deep black in color with a small, dark tan head.

Ive wanted to try this before, but I rarely trust the condition of this beer. most places that ive seen this, have a thick layer of dust on its glass shoulders, but WLv had a clean looking bottle so I grabbed it.  I like the lion on the black cap, but my opener bends it out of shape .... so i toss it and focus on the beer.  Black color with a tall beige head that looks like swiss cheese from the side, its rocky on top as the foamy head pockets keep collapsing.  Toasted malt aroma, chocolatey,   roasted, sweet ... its nice I really like it.  Very thin in the mouth chocolate, sweet, milk, roast, molasses, and rum.  A little roast warmth in the back of my throat, this has too much alcohol burn.  Hmm .. the sweetness is getting to me too.  Too much sugary milk.  I thought foreign stouts should be more hoppy, I didnt notice that ... it looks like this near perfectly fits the ratebeer description of foreign stout.

1945,"2007-01-10",3.8,"11.2 oz. bottle. The powerful aroma suggests mocha and nuts. It is slightly sour, and both the dark malts and the hops are present. The beer pours a sharp near black color with an amber hue and a creamy tan head. The flavor is remarkably sweet. It contains milk chocolate notes, hop tartness, and a dunkel lager-like taste from the dark malts. The alcohol taste is slightly noticeable. There is surprisingly little aftertaste. In the palate, this medium-bodied beer is very creamy, as if I had poured it out of a nitro can instead of a glass bottle. This is a good dessert beer, and I think it would accompany chocolate cake or mousse nicely. It is well worth trying, but it didnt blow me away.

The flavour is very smooth and light, especially considering the ABV. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Actually, it amazes me how easy drinking this is, perhaps only in contrast after having so many big, hefty American and Canadian Imperial Stouts. Still, very nice chocolate, oatmeal, and roasted malt in the flavour. The finish is equally smooth, with very little bitterness. Could also be thrown into the category of a Sweet Stout.

Thick, sweet, sticky mouthfeel with a little bit of carbonation.  Very dry and bitter finish with some sweetness lingering behind.

625 ml bottle
Recent bottling, savoured 09/06
Medium pour in a tulip glass.

Poured black with a huge light brown frothy mostly lasting head with good lacing.

Smelt of heavy chocolate, with light coffee, roasted malt, herbs and port.

Taste was upfront moderate sweet chocolate and  light acidic fruitiness, followed by a lingering heavy bitter roasted taste, with tinges of clove honey, soy sauce and red wine.  Mouthfeel was light, fizzy, oily, and the finish lightly alcoholic and heavily astringent.

Overall, a perfectly balanced foreign stout that packs a punch on aroma and taste, and hides the abv wonderfully.

Side Note:  Ive tried this with freshly squeezed mango juice, 1 part juice 1 part Lion Stout.  The Sri Lankan locals apparently make a cocktail that involves mango juice, passion fruit and Lion Stout, but I havent a clue where to get passion fruit.  Close enough, the result was equally eye opening.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"

This beer tastes much better when warm. Could not find the sweetness that others did.  Naturally astringent bitterness clinging long after the finish that makes you sip.  Moretti La Rossa has almost as much alky but has a much better beer flavor. The label proudly states its alky content and you wont pass a DUI stop after drinking three of these. Not quite as good as I anticipated. I dont how it made the 96th percentile.   I know hops are bitter but there is something else in there except bitter hops. If you love IPA, try this one  Everyone else loves this but I guess Im not a real beer drinker if I dont like bitter beer. Probably better if you eat something with this. I bought a case on a recommendation, now Im sorry.

1945,"2006-08-18",3.8,"I believe that I had this years ago.  At that time, I think it came in a clear bottle with a yellow, silk screened label.  It always stood out in my mide as being a really good brew, so I recently picked up a bottle to see how it is these days.  Here goes...  Opaque - Very, very dark brown - nearly black.  Brown head comes and then goes pretty quickly.  Smells like chocolate covered raisins.  Flavor starts with malty, chocolate flavors, then goes to mocha with a little alcohol bite.  Dry, smoky finish.  Suprisingly light on the palate - somewhat watery actually and maybe too much carbotation.  I am somewhat disappointed with this beer this time around...  Update:  This one is growing on me as it warms up.  The aroma and flavor have gotten better - more complexities are coming out (toffee, chocolate/raisin flavor, roastiness, coffee).  The mouthfeel is much better as well - smoother and slightly less carbonation.  Less alcohol bite - it seems to be more hidden as the other flavors and maltiness come out more.  This is a very tasty beer at a very  reasonable price.  Im glad I tried it again.

Sri Lanka is not somewhere I would think of when considering quality beer but this is well worthy of its lofty position. The nose is obviously stout like but there is a wonderful note of vanilla cake too. The roasted malt is a given but here it is well pronounced and quite excellent. Hints of plum in there too. The body is deepest darkest brown with a thin tan film. Flavour is just like the aroma but with a noticable kick of alcohol. It is almost too much but just before it starts to be unpleasant there is a dollop of sweet malt and a very late rush of bitter hops. A well balanced full bodied gem.

How can a brewer be so pre-occupied with loading in layers of flavour (and there are lots here) that they forgot people are supposed to DRINK this.

Forget the flavours of toffee, mocha, etc.:  the alcohol content overwhelms the overall taste and gives it a very malty/bitter finish (chocolate finish?! that is the taste of too much alcohol).  All of this is not necessary (way better stouts out there to DRINK for sure, that are smoother, creamier and well balanced)!  If you prefer to write about beer, then Sinha/Lion might be good for you.

The taste is fantastic, a good balance between the sweetness of a B52 coffee, tempered by an elegant acidity (yet again coffee) and a lingering bitter chocolate finish. Palate is a little thin but still one of my favorite stouts.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbiere"

1945,"2006-07-05",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2008 In short: A soft un-roasted ""refreshing"" Stout
How: In tasting sessions first.  Then many bottles since Quebec SAQ started to import it.  No change in appreciation
The look:  Black body, small beige head.
In long: Black body, small off-white head.  Coffee beans and vanilla taste with a black licorice after-taste.  Not very sweet.  Not much roasted or chocolate flavours in there.  Body on the bit thin side for a stout.  A touch of acidity bothers me and I got that from all bottles.  8% is very well hidden.  A decent light stout but not the tasty after-meal stouts that I like.  Id even say that this stout is refreshing and thats not the quality Im looking for in an 8% stout.  Seems to be the most popular beer from Sri Lanka.  I always thought buddhists were the calmest most peaceful people on earth, maybe they are just hammered.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

head. Dominant black-licorice aroma, with sweet coffee and burnt wood also
showing through. The flavour starts off Turkish-coffee-sweet, evolves to a
thick alcohol middle, and finishes with nuances of coffee and black licorice. Smooth palate. Too sweet to make you want more than one in a sitting.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","JohnBarleycorn"

1945,"2006-06-25",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2006 Tosa Tasting - June 24, 2006

After ten months, this finally got opened.  Im not sure if you are supposed   to age a foreign stout that long but it certainly held up well.  A great   value at $2.99 for a 625 ml bottle and fairly common in smaller sizes as well.   If you have had this, you ought to give it a try.

Aroma / Appearance - An interesting combination of chocolate, caramel   and bananas reminded me of an ice cream sundae.  That is, if you roasted malt   and sprinkled it on top as well.  There were also some grainy notes lurking   in the background.  The deep black one-finger head left sticky tan lacing   oozing down the side of the glass.  The body itself was pitch black, trapping   all light that had the misfortune to try and pass through it.

Flavor / Palate - This was chewy and bitter with a rich roasted malt   impression being the first thing to hit my senses.  An underlying cocoa powder   flavor joined hints of coffee and wheat.  Every sip had a nice full body that   satisfied the palate with a balance of bitterness and maltiness.  If I had to   chose when to drink this it would be a cool fall day when the leaves are   turning red, brown and orange.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1945,"2006-06-25",3.2,"Pours a very dark brown color, almost black. Medium-3sized tan head. The aroma starts with coffee but also has a sour undertone to it. Kind of funky. Flavor is sweet chocolate, not bad stuff.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
1945,"2006-06-24",4.0,"An opaque pour with a huge mahogany dark tan head.  Aromas of chocolates, cherries, toasted grain and a roasted sweetness.  It has a sweet milk chocolate flavor, with a roasted finish.  Im also picking up some toasted cherries in the mix.  Its a very good stout... one of the best Ive had.

1945,"2006-02-27",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2006 Lion Stout
,

Chocolate City meets the Pacific.

I must admit I had a slew of predispositions about this beer. 
I was thinking a Sri Lankan brew, really? 

After watching the rolling, silky, fat-girl-in-satin-nightie pour- the first taste coaxed me into submission until I was lapping at the lions paw. 

A beautiful soft, round mouth feel is accented with rich, delicately sweet notes of cacao and coffee muted with a beautiful slightly sweet finish. 

Theres something about a beer with a purpose that turns me on. 
I mean anytime I eat any coconut curry (Indian or Thai) I will either be drinking this beer or thinking about drinking this beer. The Lion Stout even at room temperature is absolute fantastic combination with all hot curries dishes. This will be in attendance in the cellar for its occasions.

*side note: This brewery stopped brewing its beer to bottle water for victims of the tsunami.

1945,"2006-01-28",4.8,"Lion Stout pour to a beautiful, deep ebony color with a thick tan head that fades slowly, and a high to moderate amount of carbonation. This beer is a real ale which means some yeast is added to the bottle. A bottle conditioned beer is meant to continue to condition and develop in the bottle. The nose on this beer is wonderful. Aromas of bitter sweet chocolate, woody notes of cedar, and peppery hints of alcohol flood the nose. The palate is a soft malty body, with flavors of dark chocolate, sweet malt, hints of coffee flavor, and a touches of roast. Lion Stout finishes with more chocolate and coffee notes up front, then ends with a wonderful, refreshing, sour edge, and a slight bitter and warming finish. 

This beer is outstanding. It reminds me very much of Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, and is similar to Dragon Stout, in its sweetness and alcohol bite. That refreshing sour edge in the finish, makes this big beer very drinkable, even in hot, tropical weather. This beer would make the perfect foil to desert. I would match this beer with coconut layer cake. I understand the locals lace this beer with a strong coconut liquor and enjoy it that way as well. Lion Stout would also make a perfect night cap.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Solid black color with a fine, subsiding head and a good amount of lacing.

1945,"2005-06-28",4.6,"Review #299. I wanted to save Lion Stout for my 300th review, but Ive got a Westy 12 chillin...
A stalwart, mocha-brown head floats like a sponge atop an über-dark body with a blood red aura. Aromas were roasted almost to the point of being burnt with chocolates, dark fruits and campfire.  Flavor starts moderately bitter with chocolate and roasts ending with a semi-sweetness in a thick & syrupy yet creamy smooth palate. My only complaint lies with its discreet potency... I made the mistake of enjoying four of these one night before bed and remained mostly drunk the next day at work. But, oh... what a wonderful beer!

1945,"2005-05-23",4.4,"Have to start by thanking Mark Lightfoot from the International Beer shop, W. Leederville, for recommending this gem. Quite easily the best Foreign Extra Stout I have tasted, and possibly ever will!! Poured into a stumpy tulip, a large dense, light brown head formed, stuck firmly to the side of the glass, and webbed like paint down the sides. Black and completely opaque body with only a little yeast that settled out on the bottom. Intense roasted malt nose, quite sweet and treacly, with wafts of dark chocolate, molasses, coffee grains and light sherry notes (dont know the age of the bottle). An underlying alcohol spice seemed to compliment the other aromas, and it all came together like a dark, winter pudding dessert and travelled straight through into the mouth. Big in body, lightly carbonated and smooth as silk across the tongue, it finished off with a long warming alcohol and malt swallow, that just hit all the right buttons. Flavours of burnt sweet sugars, milk and dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, plums and other dark fruits and a hint of earthy spices, seemed balanced to perfection and all in unison to complete this wonderful beer. Big in flavour, smooth and creamy and well crafted. A wonderful Stout and one I am sure to hunt down again. Lovely!!!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Really nice, but a bit too sweet and not burnt enough to be my ultimate Foreign Stout. Many thanks to ol_juntan. RR: Yes! Finally this is available in Melbourne (and dirt cheap!) Vague prune and sultana aroma like Sam Smiths imperial, beautifully round and multi-faceted roast with big, rich malt.

1945,"2004-10-09",3.6,"smells like prune wine in a corn cob pipe, and looks black as hash.

This has got some buzz to it, I can smell the alcohol. My bottle has appreciable carbonation that with the help of the alcohol cuts the stout malting. Burnt bread pudding. Some raisin, burnt sugar, a picture of one black raspberry on a leaf, burnt sugar, bittersweet chocolate shavings on a bed of barley straw....carmelized bread crust, and a little bit of black licorice.
Awright. The ""8.0%"" alcohole has kicked in...
Burnt chocolate bread pudding. Theres a photo of hops thrown in the brewing process, and a carbon copy is retained in the after taste.  I agree with the overall ranking, a good, not bad stout with a good price.

Personal flavor picture: Imagine trying to cook Ghiradelli brownies (from a mix) in aluminum foil on the engine of your brother-in-laws small pick up engine while you drive 75 miles to tailgate a pro-football game. When youre drunk enough to pull the foil out, AND youre drunk enough to lick it clean, thats where youll find the flavor of this stout.

Pleasant mocha and coffee aftertaste.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.  No strong alcohol presence considering the 8% abv, which I like.  Alcohol becomes a little more noticeable near the end of the bottle but never to the point where its overpowering.  Creamy mouthfeel.  This is just an excellent beer.  I dont drink too many repeat beers because Im always looking to rate something new, but Ill make an exception for this considering its quite the bargain at $2.49  for 625 ml.

The carbonation is pretty strong with small, almost sharp bubbles.

The taste is unexpectedly mild and sweet, with a strong flavour of burned malt (caramel?). The almost toffee-like taste is replaced by a mouthfeel of alcohol and an aftertaste with hints of raisins, coffee with cream and a vegetable-like taste (cucumber?). 

The lasting aftertaste is almost all alcohol.

Aroma of slight roast, stale raisin, parched prunes, dry cocoa, and anise. Taste is mild with tame roastability and soft chocolate, slight floating sweetness of dry dark fruits, touches of molasses and toffee roast. Doesnt withstand too much in the flavor dept. or in its length, over far to quickly, but it does incur a certain broad range of capable character. Feel is smooth, a bit sweet and tangy, lightly roasted edge, just shy of a medium body mostly, seems to pick up a bit towards the finish where it drys out with some light cocoa. A fairly decent effort; quick stout flavors and a somewhat healthy body, but good be better. I would consider this over a Guinness on nitro-tap I think?","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Lots of wood and soy, a touch of licorice and dry chocolate.  I taste a touch of dry fruit underneath the salt, and perhaps some nuttiness too.  Very complex.

Its creamy, sticky and medium tan/beige.  Aroma is initially strong of fruit esters, mainly banana with something like oats and sweet chocolate coming on quickly.  Light hops mix in and it gets more roasty.  The flavor is equally impressive.  Lots of sweet sugary malt, mostly chocolate but has a nice english toasted malt appeal, somewhat reminiscent of Sam Smiths Imperial Stout.  Flavor of sweet, chocolatey malt continues to stay strong.  Mouthfeel is silky with a slight touch of grit that is pleasing.  Tastes of soft black fruit faintly.  Finishes lightly bitter, somewhat drier and has a good flavor of hazlenut on the aftertaste.  Quite sweet and a bit too much alcohol apparency to give it a perfect on the palate, but it still has a wonderful texture. 8/5/9/4/17 Rerate<i/>  Bottle at Bukowskis Tavern, Boston.  After preaching to my friend how great this beer was, and that he should definitely try it, it was quite disappointing when we actually did get it.  Not bad, of course, but much less full and flavorful than I recall.

1945,"2003-01-27",4.0,"Quite dark, but, then again, it's a stout, and that's a given.  Good-sized puffy head.  Nose has molasses and chocolate.  Flavor is nicely smoky, with a hint of bitterness.  When I spilled half of the bottle on myself, it was quite wet.  Cold, too.  Spotted the carpet admirably.  Viscous enough to be difficult to clean up.  May have possibly spilled a drop or two into the keyboard, meaning there's a real possibility of a sticky ""n"" key in the future.  Monitor ratings for future misspellings to check on this.

It tastes like licorice, coffee, chocolate and currants.  There is a lot of roastiness, bording on a smokey flavor.  This leaves a tingly, enjoyable, alcoholic feeling on the tongue.

The fruits are dark but lively - blackcurrant and prune, with tawny port overtones. The nuts are almond and pistachio.

A very interesting experience, had the appearance of a nice chocolate head on it but that was lacking from my taste of it.

1945,"2002-07-04",4.0,"What a joy to select a beer because of it representing a different country to sample, and it being something other than a skunky international-style lager.  This beer deserves a 10 for appearance--poured ungently, a unique and gorgeous type of cascading followed, leaving a caramel colored lace head, mostly diminishing after five minutes.  Dark as a winters moonless night.  I could sense some alcohol in an otherwise understated and malty aroma, but that was mostly absent from a relatively (but not supremely) complex mix of smoke, coffee, and bitter chocolate (the smoke was the strongest).  Michael Jacksons endorsement (on the bottle label) of this as a liquor-like beer is perhaps charitable, in that it might also be interpreted as having fleeting moments of medicinal-like flavors--a slight flaw on an otherwise enjoyable beer, one worth seeking out.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

1945,"2002-03-15",2.7,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2012 Can. Head is initially large, frothy, brown, mostly lasting. Body is black (almost opaque).  Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, dark chocolate, coffee, husks, cereal), with notes of soy sauce, milk. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, husky. Medium body, creamy/oily texture, lively carbonation. Honestly?  Its a little unpleasant.  I liked this 6-8 years ago, but, well...its got some unattractive malt character mixed in and some soy sauce and lactose as well.  My stomach clenches up a bit every time I take a sniff, and thats not a good thing.  Odd sourness in the mouth (again like milk, thats started to turn) and a grainy aftertaste.  It isnt horrible, but its certainly not the high 3s sorta beer I used to take it for, at least for my tastes these days.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

The aroma is intriguing - ive been out boiling sap in a big iron kettle and it reminds me of that swirl of steam and woodsmoke, with chocolate accents.  The taste is complex, too, and excellently expresses the chocolate promise of the nose, dried cherries,  and, I kid you not, smoked fish!
