Pours a totally clear piss yellow-gold with a very small white head that settles into a thin ring and eventually vanishes altogether. Its sweet and soda-like, kind of like a ginger ale in texture and mix of sweetness and spice, with pear, stone fruit, dry wood, and peppery spice. Seeing that it was tequila barrel aged makes sense but might be tough to identify independently. Light-bodied, with medium carbonation.

It is not at all unpleasant, rather floral and tropical with underlying fresh leafy greens and a vinous note. Full-flavored with a big punch of fruity/floral sweetness and a fruit cocktail linger (peach, pear). Mostly enjoyable, but sometimes I catch a whiff of medicinal sanitizer or something that reminds me of sitting in a hospital exam room. ~~~~~ Single 12 oz. bottle from a mix-a-six, Marianos, Oak Lawn, IL","Oak Lawn, Illinois, USA","frankenkitty"

1080,"2014-11-05",3.4,"This is in the soda pop-like range of ciders but it has a nice fresh pear flavor to it so I dont mind. It is clear in the glass and headless. Nose is almost all pear and the spirit barrel character is brought out by the sweetness once it is tasted. I am not sure I would pick this out w/o knowing it was put in tequila barrels but it has a nice black pepper character along w/ a bit of peach and citrus. This is a tad sweet for my liking and maybe not as drinkable as it could be but it is nearly seven percent alcohol so I suppose thats OK. I would absolutely love to try a dry version of this cider as the combination of pears and spice from the tequila really seems to work. This is definitely worth trying if you are a fan of ciders.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1080,"2014-11-03",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2015 On tap at Brixies Beer Bar in Brookfield, IL., and dispensed to a shaker with a very bright & crystal clear appearance, with a slightly straw tint, just a very thin ring, and a few, nearly clear spots on the glass. The nose was definitely pear, with a touch of agave scent. Light to medium bodied, the taste was sweet & tart, with a slight, tannic astringency, and a touch of alcohol/tequila blended in. Tasty, but a little too syrupy for me. Glad I was able to share a full serving. Next time, a 12 oz. bottle at Lunar Brewing Co., poured to a Czech-pils glass. Noticed additional touches of earthiness & barrel, candy sweetness, and a hint of licorice in the nose. The taste was a clean & mellowed continuation of the pear, agave, and these notes.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
1080,"2014-11-01",3.3,"Definitely more interesting than many perries/ciders. I rarely drink tequila, so Im not able to pick out that flavor, but theres a nice fruit quality, too, with dimensionality.
