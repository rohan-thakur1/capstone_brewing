4436,"2016-02-11",4.3,"Bottle, 2011, drunk 2/5/16. Huge thanks to James for opening this!Lightly murky, drab copper with some brighter hay tones throughout. Huge white head, even decanting the beer, that slowly fades to cover.Unmistakable elderflower in the nose combines with perfumey brett notes, tons of basement/cellar character and a light touch of wood. Its bright, pervasive and true to Cantillons fruit lambics, very fruit-forward (in this case flower-forward). Elderflower, being quite powerfully aromatic, seems to find a good match in the ripe and earthy funk that Cantillon lambics bring to the table and its incredibly unique smelling the interplay of both.Delightful carbonation, tight and natural as always, helps spread this magnificently flavorful elderflower all over the palate, while lactic and brett acids somewhat match the intensity providing their own funky punch. At 5 years of age, this is still very vibrant and strong and Id be very hard-pressed to imagine this being optimal to drink when brand new. The elderflower is a very strong flavor component that easily (and has almost always) turns things astringent when not carefully controlled. While it is here done very well, there are still some touches of bland nuttiness, soap/oil and light astringency that are inevitable from its use. Wood/oak and mature barnyard flavors abound behind the elderflower and the beer is an absolute joy to drink. Experimental and fun, yet well-executed.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours a clear, sun yellow color, with a small white head, producing a ring of lacing.

The aromas reveal flowery green pepper, wild honey and dandelions among a well pronounced barnyard funkiness. The beers sourness is easily recognizable on its own, while it blends really well into the dough flowers, without overpowering their nuances, highlighting the beers subtle qualities. Produces a certain wine gum aroma, without turning sweet at all, exhibiting old hops and dusty malts.

Has a lower carbonation, with a slick finish among a pleasantly light bodied beer, with a nice tart refreshing mouthfeel to it. 

The taste offers dusty malts among leather and a lemony tang, among matured grassy hops and a brett infused tartness. This foundation gets lended more depth by the addition of young green pepper, wet flowers and a whiff of wild honey. Pushes the flavors into a slick dryness, while featuring a unique blend of flowers and herbs, with green pepper tying the taste together. Finishes with a lemon peel infused sourness, creating a dry crispness, together with earthy malts, showcasing slightly toasted green pepper in the very back end of the palate.

This is a very unique beer, as it creates an unforeseen melange of great flavors, ranging between flowers, honey and fresh green pepper, blending together to a fantastic lambic. It tastes very refreshing, while it reveals a lovely depth of flavors, which makes this a gulper and a sipper at the same time.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The spice and pepperiness detract from the flavor big time, unfortunately. Overall its muddled and Id lean towards calling it a spice bomb.

**After trying additional examples and taking the advice of Bill Y, decanting this beer gives it a huge increase in palatability. After pouring into a decanter and letting sit for 30-40 minutes a lot of the harsh peppery spice notes are muted and you can taste the elderflower on its own. Still a very unique example of what plant additives can do to lambic. Perhaps my least favorite Cantillon from the standard lineup, though an interesting curiosity to revisit sparingly.","Massachusetts, USA","gn0sis"

Hugely spicy and woody, subtle elderflower that grows stronger through the woody, austere finish. Quite a bit more bitterness than Im accustomed to in a lambic. The underlying lambic seems softer and sweeter than most Cantillons. Tartness mainly shows at the end, which is basically the funkiest part of the beer. Great innovation. This really gets to the roots of beverage-making: take alcohol, steep with flavouring.

Vintage 2010

A: Golden on straw ale with excellent clarity. Two fingers of bone white foam falls to a quilt of the same, which stays for the life of the beer. Central column of continuous bubbles. Spotty lacing.

S: Whoa, I could smell this as soon at it was corked! The Elderberry Blossoms are potent! I have never had this flower in my face, so I cant compare, my table mates said it was totally obvious (Cena didnt know it was brewed with the flower and called it out immediately). To me: peppercorns, soil, black tea, cilantro and a hint of mint. Cant get my nose out of the glass, its embarrassing given my new company wants to chat.

T: Initially soil forward, peppery, herbal. I honestly am having a difficult time describing this beer. Its something I would pair with oysters on the half-shell alongside some enanthaler and chilled white grapes. There, that clears it up right? 

M: Thin bodied with prickly carbonation. Good dry finish. Truly this is like a sparkling wine.

So, now it is time to rate this one. Jean didnt let me buy this one in his shop, but luckily I found it somehere else. I hope he trusts people to sell his nice Lambics to and take them home to share it with friends or drink it alone with time rather than to keep them at the brewery, ah well who am I to say so, the man must  have his good reasons.
More medium than bigger sized, lively and fairly quick fading harsher foamy white head on top of a an almost almost clear yellow colored Lambic. The last filled glasses are good hazy, beautiful equally hazy, looks really nice and even seems to taste better.
The aromas are a sublime mix of mostly flowers and wood, with some good hints of wild yeast, burned rubber, citronella, manure, wet old cellar and a slight hint of sulphur.
The flavours are marked by the typical Cantillon sour wild yeast notes with nice earthy tones, theres stone, tractor tire/rubber, yoghurt, flowers, wet cellar ish, straw, old dried hops and hop flowers, rope, dust, a hint of abricot and a dry touch to it. Well balanced and tasty.
Low to slightly medium carbonation, soft sparkly mouthfeel at first than it turns a bit dry, a good medium body with a slightly fuller tint and a texture between watery and creamy.
Very well balanced, easy drinkable and that smell with those flowers, chapeau! Another really good beer from Cantillon!","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"

4436,"2012-12-04",4.5,"Pours a hazy blonde with a small but well retained head with some lacing on the glass. 

The nose is remarkable, beer wise like nothing else, but still all around familiar. The classic lemony, dusty and funky elements of Lambic are all there, but they almost take a back seat to a harmoniously balanced element of earthy and ditch weedy floweriness. In some way it smells very much like black jack gum as well... which rules. 

The flavor is earthy, both in a way that labmics many times are, but also in a different way as well. Earthy in a sort of way that no other beer Ive ever tasted is. The beer is floral in a sort of dandelion-y way. It is softly bitter with a nicee mild lemon and citrus rind character and sourness. The flavor is something akin to Anise but not quite that, I assume this is the flavor of elderflower and I like whatever it is quite a bit. The oakiness is subdued but noticeable. Everything is in its right place, and while the elderflower takes center stage, at no point does it seem like one is drinking anything other than a Lambic.

Taste is similarly overwhelmed by green bell pepper flavors.  Others claim its floral; all I get is green bell pepper though.  Finishes with cracked black pepper and a touch of capsaicin heat (wtf?!).

A: Appears a very hazy straw color with a huge head and copious amounts of lacing. Much more head and lacing than I was expecting from a Cantillon brew.

S: OK...this is shockingly different than any beer I have ever smelled. Huge herbal and floral aromas combined with an intense scent of what can only be elderflowers. Points for intrigue, originality, allure and potency. Wow...

T: Again, a taste unlike anything I have ever had. Peppers, peppercorn, vegetable garden, chiles, jalapenos, pickles, and flowers. What a combination. If you could imagine drinking an herb & vegetable garden, this is it. Normally, when one describes a beer as tasting vegetal, the statement carries a negative connotation. Not the case here - a special experience for your taste buds provided by Cantillon.

Not in a bad way, but I get clear references. Its fruity and floral indeed with hints of melon and strawberries. Towards the ending a near pungent herbal twitch thats a bit confusing.

4436,"2012-04-25",3.3,"Poured into a tulip. 2011 vintage. I always wondered why this is categorized as a fruit lambic since as far as I know, flowers arent fruit.

3.5 A: Lightly hazed yellow orange color. Two and a half fingers of foamy white head. Retention is mediocre and no lacing is left.

4.5 S: Plenty of musty, earthy, and dirty funk in this. Pond water, sweat socks, diaper to start. Rotting peachiness, woody, lightly astringent. Lemongrass, lemon zest. The elderflowers offer a pleasant herbalness along with something along the lines of an Anaheim pepper. Fairly dry and without a lot of acidity. Perhaps a touch of lactic acid with no acetic to be found.

3.5 T: There is a surprising sour kick in the taste though. Its not super intense, but it gets the job done. Also a much bigger bitterness and tannic astringency. Perhaps its the elderflowers that add this bitterness. I wouldnt know since I dont go into fields and munch on whatever I see. Lighter pepperiness in the taste. Lightly herbal. Dirty diaper is back along with sweat socks and pond water. Lemon and peachy fruitiness. Very oaky with a rotting wood component. Again, on the drier side.

3.5 M: Not bad here, but it could use a bit more spritz and more creaminess. Lighter body. Active carbonation. Mildly astringent aftertaste.

3.5 D: This was good and I loved the nose, but its too bitter for my preference and the astringency is a bit distracting. Im not sure that Ill buy this again, but it was worth a try.

4436,"2012-04-08",4.3,"Acquired this in a trade. Thanks Ryan! Poured into a champagne flute and Ommegang glass. Bottling date is June 2010. Stored at Cellar temp around 55 Degrees F since bottling.

This is a capped and corked beer. As soon as I popped the cap off, the cork started sliding out of the bottle. I tried to stop it but the cork flew out and dented my ceiling and Cantillon starting spewing everywhere. I did my best and held my thumb over the top with two hands. Intense carbonation unlike any other lambic Ive seen. Wow. 

A - Gigantic carbonation in this beer. Even on a slow pour, bubbles invade the glass producing a 5-7 finger head almost instantly. The bubbles are big, impressive and unforgiving. It takes about 3 minutes for the big bubbles to dissipate and Im left with only an ounce of beer. This beer FORCES you to drink it slowly. This is a 5 on the SRM rating for appearance. Dark gold to cedar color in appearance. Not easy to see through and a hint of clouds. After a few minutes, the head is just a quarter finger with some lacing on the glass edges.

S - Im getting a lot of wood, earth and funkiness on the first scent and a really hard habanero or chili pepper burn in the back of my throat. Theres a bit of dried fruits like raisins or papaya. Very tropical fruit scent to this beer. Theres also a big musty scent like dust and old wood. Very intriguing.

T - This has that taste of a very old lambic 4-6 years or more old. The floral notes are actually not that intense. Im getting oak and apricot and chili peppers. Theres this spice thats more like table pepper. Its pretty amazing. I also get honeysuckle and that great lambic funkiness.

M - Almost no carbonation on the mouth swish. Lingering spice and earthiness and tart.

O - This beer is fantastic. Theres no huge taste other than the peppers and Im not a fan of spicy beers. This is unlike anything Ive ever had. Solid A but Id love more sour and less carbonation on the pour.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

On est aussi très collé aux soubresauts habituels de la maison.  Comment ne pas aimer la signature Cantillon?  Donc, au-delà des délicates fleurs et des piments broyés, une salve bien nourrie par les citrons et par la douce folie des microbes.  Les saveurs sont aussi dominées par les fleurs aux pétales épicés et par un aspect rustique tout à fait charmant.  Des notes aigres qui sépanchent sur ma langue et des notes surettes qui grandissent avec intelligence.  Les instances citronnées qui prévalent dans le premier verre sont accompagnées un peu plus loin par la franche et jeune camaraderie des raisins blancs.  Limpression que laisse en bouche ce liquide est mené par une main de maître: le corps est sculptural tandis que le pétillement est soutenu.  Et la texture, une caresse pour la langue.  Difficile de faire mieux.   En finale, une ode aux notes poivrées et asséchantes.  Franchement, un pur délice.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

This looks a lot liek a gueuze. A light golden straw color, transparent everywhere and even more clear at the edges.

A soft floral sweetness dominates the aroma, with a soft funky back. Lemon zest, white pepper, and some biscuity malt provide support. 

The flavor starts and stays tart, with an overlaying flowery sweetness. There is a lemon zest sourness that closes out the flavor. Lemon tartness and some floral funkiness dominate the flavor, but it works out well, unlike Iris. 

The body and carbonation, like the appearance, are standard Cantillon. Medium, slightly creamy carbonation, and a medium body.

4436,"2012-02-09",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Boisterous elderflowers move into citrusy funk, as subdued acidity and fluffy effervescence make for a compelling summer brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A tower of foam tops the hazy blond.
-That aroma is pure elder flower. I loved it, but it kind of masks the complexity of what is to come in the flavor profile.
-Im even getting hints of saffron; cant say thats happened often when drinking beer...
-The flavor profile is quite Saison-like. The drinkability helps a lot too; this is not of those super acidic lambics.
-Cantillon keeps making these very impressive new creations AND their staples are consistently excellent. I dont see myself stopping to encourage them any time soon.

T - Starts off with a big lemony twang slowly giving way to a mix of elderflowers, dry oak tannins, light barnyard funk, and plenty of peppery spice. The finish is a mix of light funk and spice, lingering on the pallet for some time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderately high carbonation. Light, tart, feel with fairly active carbonation. Compared to some of the other Zwanzes this one had one of the better feels.

The flavor is sour and tart with the lemon juice and zest, moving to a hard to describe floral note that almost comes off as green bell pepper or green peppercorn, with the barnyard funk and vanilla oak underlying.  The body is light with very lively, nearly sparkling, carbonation and a long tart, funky, and tannic green bell pepper and vanilla oak finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

There is a bit of light floral character there as well, in addition to some mild herbs. The pepper character is really overwhelming, and takes the flavor even more. Really odd and not very enjoyable.

750 ml bottle into my Narke tulip...Pour is nothing to discuss as this beer is all about the elder flowers. Going in I had no idea what one smelled like, now I know, and I wont be searching them out again. A super strong acidic chilipepperish aroma attacks your nose from the start almost stinging it like a whiff of a strong medication. I can almost visualize waves of the aroma coming off it like its some cartoon characterization..The taste is much of the same, but thankfully its toned down a bit and not nearly as harsh. The astringency is much weaker, especially as your drink it, I guess you almost get used it to. Its certainly a unique flavor, something probably worth trying but one that is just not for me, despite a relatively high score that I give it for its uniqueness and effort.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

The taste is also fairly floral with the chilis making their presence known. Lingering bitterness. Some citrus zesty lemon  notes as well. Light mouthfeel.

4436,"2010-10-11",4.1,"750ml bottle, labeled as Zwanze 2009 (not Mamouche), consumed at RBWG in March 2010.  A beautifully cloudy, glowing, golden hued body sports a thin, swirly, off-white layer of foam at the head.  A sudsy, micro-spot wash mostly glides down the glass and rejoins the body.  The nose is completely, 100% unique, far different than any other Cantillon product (or that of any other brewery really) that I can recall.  Earthy as can be, the theme here is very peppery and floral, showing strong suggestions of dried elderflowers, moist potting soil, and fresh celery, all wrapped up beautifully with a mildly tart, lemony lambic shroud.  Wow!  Im caught off guard with these scents, and it takes a while to settle in and contemplate it all.  Flavors are considerably more sour, as the buggy wood and sharp lemon acidity take a more aggressive stance.  The fresh vegetal notes again take hold, giving hints of earthy green herbs, spicy flower blossoms, celery, and maybe some green bell pepper.  Ultimately, it is the lemony base lambic that lingers on the finish, though the earth goes a long way too.  The palate seems more on par with the Cantillon standard, as it shows a dry, crisp, and refreshing acidity, with appropriately soft and persistent carbonation that delicately distributes the complexities that this nepenthe proudly features.  This is one in which the written description simply doesnt translate well......you need to try this brew to understand what its all about.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

4436,"2010-09-28",4.0,"750ml bottle, capped and corked, from the Cantillon brewery in Brussels. Dated June 15 2010, yes a little young, but Im mobile these days and sadly lack a fine gueuze cellar where I can store these things. Even when pulling the cork off, you see this strange floral pattern on the side of the bottle... then the cork, the cork, smells like some kind of marvellous gueuze mix that you had only smelled in your dreams, sweet dreams, thinking of what the ideal gueuze must taste like. So it pours into a Belgian chalice, huge head, very white, yellow colour as always. The aroma is this unique floral mix of young and old lambics, fermented wheat, sour vegetables. I could smell this for an hour - its gueuze, but its not gueuze, as it has this complex floral mix like youre walking through a northern European garden while drinking gueuze. The taste is a very fine typical gueuze taste with notes of herbs that I cannot identify, but recognize, from the European continent. Mouthfeel is good, but not perfect. This is really wonderful and unique stuff, like drinking a Belgian garden. I intend to buy a cellar just to have a place to store bottles of it.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"

The nose is pretty interesting.  Sharp, grassy, somewhat spicy elderflowers mixed with a musty fragrance.  The elderflowers transition to the taste, joined by juicy, slightly sour, light fruits.

Very hazy gold, bubbly, with a lasting off-white head.  God I love that aroma, which I described as ""a 70-year old, well-used horse blanket which had been left for decades in a dry but sunny corner of an old barn (no mothballs either)"" - funky dry herbal straw lemon, even fruit, and oh yes, you can smell those wildflowers!  The taste - heaven - while there wasnt much lemon sourness in the floral/funky aroma, its here in the flavour in spades - all the same components, just acidity dominates.  What makes this even more special for me is that the acidity is huge up-front, then fades quickly so that your palate is ready for another hit of it again almost immediately - incredibly drinkable.  Light bodied and sticky, massively acidic of course, strongly carbonated, and the lingering impression is dry floral acidity and a vague suggestion of sweet lemon drops.  This is a great sipper, one of my favorite ""drinking"" sours of all time, really - the way the carbonation, the funky sourness and the delicate floral character all interact make this one memorable.

4436,"2010-08-16",4.1,"Was told by the brewer that this is the Zwanze 2009 (the flower one), and they are releasing it again - with an actual name. Got one of the first bottles - doesnt even have the back labeling on yet.

 Pours cloudy straw, typical of a gueuze. But the head on this thing is ginormous. Left a very nice lacing after finally dissapating. Small head left over. Grassy, flowery, pungent sour aroma. Just a little bit more floral in the nose than most anything else Ive had. A little bit of wet muskiness as well. When sipping with the bountiful head atop, it is over the top with flower. After the head falls, and you get just the beer, it is a little less so. The lambic comes through the floral-ness and hits you with the typical sour flavor you would expect. But you will still get flowers on the back end. And its not as sour as their other offerings. A good compromise. Typical lambic. Thin, leaving behind a sourness in your mouth. This one does seem a bit sweeter than others in their stable. But it might be because it is a little on the young side. Surprisingly drinkable given the ingredients of flowers. I usually dont like anything with flowers, heather, floraly spices etc. But this one is very good.

Copper colored, this one is flowery and dry. Given the absurdly short amount of time the flowers spent in the beer (two days, if I understood rightly) it packs a punch. The violet taste conceals the funk, unfortunately.

4436,"2010-07-25",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2010 Zwanze 2009; Sampled at De Heeren van Liedekercke; July 2010
The beer is lightly hazed in appearance with an orange, pale gold color that is topped by a pale off-white colored head.  This has a wild, peppery aroma to it, a sort of floral, green, almost poisonous smelling somehow, but definitely quite herbal.  There is a hint of plastic character in the nose, it definitely smells of lactic acid and has supporting notes of urea and an earthy, musty mushroom character.  The aroma is very interesting, very intense; the elder-flower is definitely quite dominant in the nose.

The beer tastes sour and lactic up front, but a flower-herbal note starts in the middle and lingers through to the finish.  A woody peppery up front must be contributed by the elder-flowers and is just very, very interesting.  The flower flavor is not nearly as strong as it is in the aroma, which is really a good thing as the aroma is certainly nice and interesting, but the intensity would have been too much if it carried over into the flavor.  Still it is strong enough that it mutes much of the base Lambic flavors.  As my palate adjusts to the elder-flower influence, the characteristic Cantillon flavors become more noticed; urea, mushrooms, an oak character and spiciness as well as a light tannic astringency is found here.  This is light bodied and quaffable, but still has some good texture to it like a good bottle conditioned Lambic should.

This is very, very interesting; while this spice is perhaps a bit too much here, I think it could work quite well in other beers when used with a more restrained hand; the herbal profile is quite distinct and a subtle use in a wit, or even a Rochefort like strong-ale could work very nicely.  I am definitely very happy to have had a chance to try this beer, and to do it at  De Heeren van Liedekercke is definitely quite a treat, when you couple in the great food, atmosphere and proprietors.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

How: Bottle 750ml at at Moeder Lambic Saint-Gilles, Brussels, Belgium.  Consumed when about 1 year of age.
The look: Clear blonde body topped by a medium white head
In long: I am not too familiar with the smell of elder flowers but one thing for sure the aroma of this beer is full of highly aromatic red garden flowers.  So much so that the signature Cantillon funk plays is mostly covered up.  I could actually smell my glass from a few feet away.  This is quite a strong aroma.  Taste is smoother than expected.  Given the strong aroma I expected a punch in the mouth.  Truth is that the taste of a Cantillon Gueuze comes out very strong in this beer.  Stronger than in any other beer from Cantillon, except for the Gueuze of course.  This is like a Cantillon Gueuze with a bouquet of dry flowers.  This beer is replacing the Foufoune as a semi-regular Cantillon.  This is an excellent (like most Cantillon) beer but I prefer the Foufoune which was a real standout in the lineup.

4436,"2010-04-11",4.2,"Bottle.  Pours a hazy golden body with a white head, wow just on aroma alone you would never NEVER guess this was cantillon!  Spicy floral pepper tones, a real pepper dryness with a bit of heat as well.  Dill spice, mouthwatering with elder flowers, really dry and not acidic or sour so much.

4436,"2010-04-09",3.9,"Bottle RBWG 10 Cloudy golden ale with a small, creamy, white head. Decent retention. The aroma is interesting and tough to peg, but Ill throw hot peppers and celery out there... in a really, really good way. Elder flowers? I dont even know what those smell like. Medium-bodied with a raspy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Very vegetal, herbal and tart. Finishes bone-dry.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

4436,"2010-04-01",3.8,"Bottle: Poured a dirty yellowish color lambic with a large foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing as well. Aroma is absolutely dominated by elder flowers and is somewhat of an acquired taste. Taste is also dominated by elder flowers and provides a floral and somewhat peppery taste to this beer which is well integrated with the tart and oak from the base lambic. Very refreshing overall though a bit too much flowers for my taste.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Elder flowers are noticeably in mouth too, creating a nice contrast between sweet flowery and the peculiar citric and barnyard dry finish.","Lovere, ITALY","Scauca"
4436,"2010-03-18",4.1,"Bottle split by Shyam.  Thanks yo.  Nose is heavy with light fruit, floral qualities (I assume elder flowers), the light delicate hops of Iris and probably the light vanilla.  Color is a pleasing yellow mellow gold like the above mentioned beers.  Flavor is really interesting: very floral, very rhubarbarous, not super heavy on tart or pepper.  Likely the sweetest lambic of my career.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
4436,"2010-03-18",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2012 Several glasses @ Cantillon Quintessence 2012. Boy did I enjoy this beer.
Le bouquet sureau de cette bière est simplement fantastique donnant cette impression de respirer un bon bol de printemps. Tout cela dans un des greniers Cantillon et on a un cadre superbe.
Le palais est tout aussi grandiose avec ce sureau qui est très prononcé mais reste agréable donna t encore une fois ces i,pressions printanières. Le tout garde se profile sec houblonné avec ce côté grains des lambic. Dans un autre style, je pense à la Tournay Cazeau qui elle aussi utilise le sureau qui reste là plus en retrait.

4436,"2010-03-15",4.2,"Thanks to whoever opened this at RBWG. Man this is an odd beer. Nose is strange with an almost asparagus or celery like quality but its not like an infection you can tell from its intensity that its intentional. Its very sour up front, really gives you a nice pucker. The backend smooths out to allow some nice grain flavor and a truly unique spicy celery flavor with a slight hint of berry. I dunno what an elder flower is but man its strange. This is totally unique and awesome in its own right.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
4436,"2010-03-14",3.2,"Thank you whoever popped this at RBWG. Ryan maybe? Pours a light yellow with bubbly white head. Aroma is very floral, veggies, green pepper, black pepper, lactic acid, funk. Flavor is overwhelming green pepper. Fresh cut green bell pepper. Black pepper, fresh cut flowers, grass, veggies. Strange. The bell pepper flavor didnt do it for me.","Alaska, USA","gkost"
4436,"2010-03-10",3.8,"Bottle shared by yespr at Woodshop 5.0 (2/20/10): Pours a transparent bright yellow golden with a small ring of white bubbles.  Very unique floral spiced nose with some underlying funk and lemon tartness.  Starts with a soft lemon citrus and herbal bitterness from the elderflowers with a smooth semi-tart finish.  An enjoyable, veey well-balanced, and unique brew.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4436,"2010-03-08",3.6,"A: The pour is hazy yellow in color with perhaps some golden tints. Theres a short lived white head, as well.

S: The nose is incredibly interesting, not like any other beer Ive come across. This, of course, would be the Elder Flowers. They provide a strong floral and herbal aroma and something that I can only describe as spicy, along the lines of chiles. Unlike other Cantillon beers, this one isnt overly funky or tart in the nose.

T: The Elder flower flavor is just as intense as the aroma is. The herbal quality is again, extremely strong. The spiciness is not as pronounced, and allows the acidity and tartness to come through a bit more. There is also a slight saltiness which I wasnt expecting, but it added an interesting dimension.

M: The body is fairly standard for a lambic, a bit on the lighter side of medium with a nice tingly carbonation and a dry finish.

D: This was indeed one of the more interesting beers Ive ever had. And in this case, interesting wasnt a polite way of saying ""not very good"". I enjoyed this experience and hope to have other years of the Zwanze beers.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

The initial floral sweetness is immediately replaced by citric acidity. Tart, spritzy and fresh, strikingly sour. The lemony horseblanket is evident, yet elderflower comes to dominate.

Medium body: loads of intense funk, hints of a wheatiness and lots of lemon custard and barnyard character; very sessionable, and not nearly as acidic or sour as many other Cantillon offerings; a hugely funky presence overall.

4436,"2010-02-21",4.0,"Thanks to Yespr for sharing this rarity.  Super strange nose greets you...somewhat chemically edge to the lime peel, fresh air, white pepper oddness.  The beer pours a light peach color with thin head.  Flavors to me seemed very vividly like oro blanco grapefruit devoid of any bitterness and most of the tartness...this was coming from the elder flowers no doubt, but it really had a grapefruit-like character in my opinion.  Also noted in the flavors were hints of freshly chlorined pool water.  Very odd beer yet very fun to drink and ponder its complexities.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

A:  Pours a nice shade of hazy golden yellow.  Nice foamy head, little retention and no lace.

S:  Very unique aromas.  Very floral.  I dont know what an elder flower smells like but I assume that is what I am picking up.  There is also a strange mix of herbs and rubber behind the first floral burst.  Light citrus round things out.

T:  Whoa, very strange.  There is a strong floral flavor (once again I assume Elder Flower) with a big blast of dill.  Light citrus, salt..... saltine crackers dare I say?  The sourness was very light, even more so by Cantillon standards.  Lots going on here, and the flavors dont seem to mesh.

M:  Medium in body, smooth, a bit dry in the finish.

Cheesy and barnyard-like notes blendes well with the elder flowers. The typical Cantillon lemon citric tones are quite subtle on the nose. Some cracker-like wheat alongside a whisper of wood. Dusty and spicy. The flavour is light sweet to dry and medium acidic with almost no bitterness. Tones of elder flowers, lemon, wood, brett and lacto.

strong aroma of sweet/bitter (as they are) fresh elderflowers  mixed with sour lambic. do i get some wood?. the elderflowers has made it a bit more sweet and bitter, which might not be a good thing, but aroma is still very good, complex and super clean. 8. flavor is fantastic. super well balanced lambic with the elderflowers taking a back seat, but still tilting the flavor a little bit towards bitter and perhaps slightly herbal.
