4508,"2016-12-12",4.1,"A bottle on Black Christmas 2016 at 12 Kings. Vintage 2013. Bottle #25/500. Pours a dark brown with no head. Aroma is very sweet, licorice, booziness. The palate is incredibly high, Taste is pretty similar to the aroma with some smokey notes. Incredible, but hardly drinkable.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"
4508,"2016-12-11",1.1,"Bottle, pours a deep dark brown with no head. Aroma brings out lots of booze, vomit, and light liqueur.

The aroma and flavor have big sweet caramel, toffee, dark fruits, and booze. I would agree with phaleslu that this is not as boozy as the Brewdog beers.

Notes of molasses, charred wood, burnt sugar, caramel, toffee - and booze, lots of booze. Medium-full bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, boozy mouthfeel. But honestly, this drinks easier than its BrewDog counterparts. It doesnt have the fusel alcohol burn those do. This is a fairly nice sipper, actually. Very pleasant surprise, compared to what I was expecting. Never thought Id see one of these. Fun stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4508,"2015-09-26",3.5,"@ phaleslus cinci tasting. .33l bottle, huge thanks to shrubber for sharing. Mostly clear red brown color, with some particles suspended in the body. No head nor lace, but crazy good, thick ribby legs on the side of my taster. Big dark fruit, alcohol heat in the nose, chocolate and nuttiness. Medium to bigger body. Little to no carbonation. Mild slick texture, though light drying in the finish, with a bite of fire. Tons of heat, definitely say a liquor-type burn to this, though impressively easy to touch for 31%. Good bit of complex dark character to this, nice flavor. Moderate to bigger sweet taste... Big sweet taste really. Alcohol heat. Wow. This is incredible to try. Never thought I would have a chance. Certainly a big heat, but not firey or like fuel... Nice complex dark character. Super-interesting. But as far as drinkability and overall pleasure... this was tricky to get to... But Im going to call it at 6.5/10, not counting novelty factor and my massive fascination around this 8/4/7/3/13","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

There are, to my surprise, some decent malt aromas way underneath all the alcohol, and even some spoiled cream a la Bernardus 12. Also some dark cherries, and offensive cheap cologne from Wears Too Much Cologne Guy. Flavor repeats the aroma profile, but adds a little honey and maple. Again, there is a good amount of sweet malt in the flavor and aftertaste. Goes down rough, as every sip is like taking a swig of true hard liquor, at least as far as ones throat and esohapus are concerned. Final thoughts: Well, I dont really have any.
