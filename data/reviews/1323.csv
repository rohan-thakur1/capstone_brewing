Surprisingly mild aroma. Expected a big punchy nose, didnt get that. Is a subtle softly dark caramel sweet one. Traces of nuts and earth. Tastes really good. Not too sweet at all, but it has a lot of dark caramel raisin sweetness. Almost like burnt raisins from a bun. It has a mild sticky kinda oily texture in the mouth and its creamy prickling on the bubbles. Lots of red berries like cranberries and freeze dried raspberries.

1323,"2011-03-26",3.6,"Sampled on tap at 1702; March 2011
This beer arrives with a tan colored head that sits on top of a dark, brown-amber colored beer.  A big caramel character is noticeable in the nose up front and this is backed by aromas of dark fruit, toasty malt touches and just a hearty, appetizing character that is quite nice, though definitely malt focused.

My first sip is sweet, with rich caramel notes that accentuate fruit notes of raisins and a big prune like flavor.  Softer toasted whole grain notes support the sweeter / fruitier notes from up front.  This has a nice, chewy body that is quite hefty for a beer of this strength.  There is a touch of roasted malt in the finish that helps add a light bitterness to go along with the touch of bitterness from the soft hop contribution.  This is actually quite nice; I really ike the malt character and the noticeable fruit component is nice, even if a bit divergent from a traditional American interpretation of a Scotch Ale.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

It has just a faint  yeasty element which is fine here but if any stronger  would certainly detract.
