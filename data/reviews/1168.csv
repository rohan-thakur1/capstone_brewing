1168,"2017-04-30",4.1,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house warming on April 23. 750 mL swing-top growler. The pour is a foggy golden yellow color with a thicker white head and a good lace as it falls down. The aroma is full of co much citrus, its spectacular. There is a strong juiciness, a heavy bitterness, light tropical fruits, and just a hint of some light leafy hops. Its a great balance that I like. The flavor is even better. The juicy citrus and tropical fruits are huge. There is a light bitterness to it and a hint of pine resin, but the hops and light leafiness are really good. This thing is just balanced from front to back, and I like it almost as much as the Double Citra. The mouth feel is light and clean with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly juicy pine bitterness. This is fantastic.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

This stuff smells so ridiculously pleasant and faraway: pineapple and papaya and mango and litchi and tangerines and jesus why doesnt every beer smell this good? Much like the Society & Solitude #8 this stuff is just so fucking smooth. This is probably only the second or third time Ive given a beer 5/5 for palate, but this brew is flawless.

It only get better after it reaches 10 c or so. My beer fridge is set at 8 C and I was a bit disappointed once I first smelled it.

White head atop is medium-sized and well-retained.A truly juicy experience in the nose as the tell-tale spicy, dank, marajuana-tinged notes combine with a massive orange juice-like character. Very little ""dry"" or ""acidic""-like notes from the nose with plentiful honey-like maltiness and no alcohol or flaw.Wow. What a bizarre flavor....its definitely not bad, but its almost like a blend of marmalade jam, fresh squeezed orange juice and flinstones chewables. Was discussing with a friend citric acid additions and this one is definitely a candidate. The orange juice character just seems a little forced and/or lightly artificial. Definitely not like any galaxy ipa Ive ever tried. Otherwise, same deliciously soft texture with ample, very sweet malts (everything here seems sweeter than most of HFs other beers) and tight carbonation.  Will revisit/rerate soon, no doubt, though interestingly wasnt as blown away by Double Citra either, so maybe these two just arent my thing.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1168,"2016-02-07",4.6,"On tap at The Blue Stone. This was poured into a tall tulip.
The appearance was a pure orange juice to rind color. One finger white foamy head that dissipated pretty quickly. Light lacing here and there.
The smell had a stunning burst of bittersweet orange juice with bitter grapefruit pulp and rind backing it all up. Light sweet mango strolls in underneath.
The taste copied the aroma nicely. Bittersweet orange juice aftertaste slides into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping to sessionable quality about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the bitterness from the hops to pack an appropriate punch.
Overall, beautifully and wonderfully done. A masterpiece of a DIPA that I know I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Le houblon est très puissant en bouche sans jamais surpasser les malts dont la forte teneur en arômes céréaliers apportent volume et profondeur. Le Galaxy est plus floral et gazonneux que fruité dans cette bière de souche fermière. Très belle densité en bouche. Peut-être un rien trop de corps pour une IIPA à mon goût. Les saveurs sont fidèles aux arômes avec un fruit supplémentaire qui nexistait pas il y a une minute à peine. Finale amère bien soutenue par les malts.

Theres nothing quite like a trip where you stumble upon a tasting with some big guns. This heavy artillery shelled my palate after just a few opening salvos. A well rounded imperial IPA breaks into the ""World Class"" tier although I dont think it was quite good enough for me to go out of my way to trade for others with so many great locals available.

Aroma / Appearance - A hazy body clouds the glass with the color of wilting dandelions. Crisp head traps mango, grapefruit, and a sea of tropical fruits. Bright, fruity, and full of resin, the experience sparkles with life.

Flavor / Palate - Crisp citrus and mango burst onto the scene like the Koolaid Man through a brick wall. Memories of warm sunny beaches fill the mind as the waves of tropical hops crest the tongue en route to the back of the throat. A lingering bitterness leaves behind long lasting traces that balance nicely without being too fatiguing. If this is a series it would be interesting to try a few more side by side.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1168,"2014-10-30",4.2,"Growler: Murky, dense sunburnt amber. Both radiant & turbid all at once. Modest soapy white head settles quickly to a thin bubbly collar. Aroma is loaded with notes of wet pine, grapefruit rind. sticky dank resins, hop oil, sugar cookie malts, juicy tangelo, pineapple, hints of passion fruit, modest grass... Very nice. Flavor is even better. Exceedingly crisp & clean. Slightly herbal & grassy hops, touch of white peppery coated pines, citrus rind lightly coated with table sugar, notes of white grape, tangerine, pineapple, & a little bit of either mango or guava... Some kind of tropical essence alongside the citrus. Sweet tropical & bitter citrus. Lots of backing grassiness. Touch of cracker malt, only enough to provide a base, never intruding on the hops. Nice mouth feel, drinks way easier than 8% with no sign of alcohol. Touch of citrus rind, pine, passion fruit, & bitter grass in the finish. Great stuff.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

The first thing I noticed about the Galaxy? Its price. The second thing? The general shape and height of the bottle. The third thing I noticed about this beer was its taste. Then I noticed the color. A sinister orangeade, this Double IPA could give you a fish, and then teach you how to fish with just one quick glance in its direction. All drinkers must be aural learners. The aroma of this beer most closely resembles that of a cool, summer breeze. Unfortunately ""most closely"" isnt close enough for my impossibly high standards of beer review. So I must resort to saying the beer smells like a vague mixture of water, yeast, hops, and barley. It smells like a mixture between heaven and hell.

1168,"2013-01-13",4.5,"Growler sent by Tucker. Consumed two days after my first review below. Scores are based on this sample.

Looks similar to most other HF DIPAs and its beautiful. Color is a hazed and cloudy glowing apricot with a fluffy, dense white head. Long lasting retention and abundant, sticky clumps of lacing. 

Aroma is perfect balanced blend of peach, grapefruit, mango, and citrus rind. Sticky and more sweet than bitter, extremely tropical and juicy. A rare 5.0 for a DIPA aroma from me...

Flavor is intensely tropical sweet and juicy to start, following the same flavors as the aroma before finishing slightly dry, floral and with strong citrus rind. Never intensely bitter or thick and overbearing. What about malts? Who cares? With this blend of flavors from the Galaxy hop and balance, a strong malt presence is not only irrelevant, but unwelcome. I would give the flavor a 5 as well if not for the previous growler (that drabmuh also reviewed) where we picked up on some unpleasant vegetable flavors.

Body is medium thick, creamy and smooth. Reminds me of Double Sunshine in the softness of the texture where the beer is light and refreshing, instead of being a thick, chewy chore to get through. 

So here we are. All of HFs IPAs/DIPAs have been great or exceptional and IMO this is the pinnacle so far. Not as flashy as Ephraim but Ephraim isnt an everyday beer. This is as good as a big ""everyday"" DIPA can and should be. All tropical hops, restrained bitterness, undetectable alcohol, perfect body and aroma. I guess Im saying I liked this.

Growler shared by Thorpe429

This is a great DIPA. I enjoyed this more than HFs Double Citra. Not quite as much as Ephraim. Certainly not on the level of recently sampled Double Sunshine or Kryptonite and not on the level of other ""classics"". Grapefruity, lemony, danky and floral, everything I want from a DIPA except, oh wait, why is this so fricking vegetative in the finish. Funny, I dont remember that touch from batch 1 and now Im very curious to try another growler.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

Taste follows, more alcohol, less fruit, building dry grapefruit pith bitterness.

The beer is a hazy orange hue, with a small head that hangs out for a while, leaving a fair bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is just awesome, with bold scents of oranges, grapefruits, hops, and nary a trace of malt. What a delicious beer. I wish I had a keg of this. Teeming with delicious citrus and hop flavors, this is hard not to chug. Superb on all accounts, I highly recommend this beer. Hill Farmstead is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.

1168,"2011-07-05",4.7,"Tremendous thanks to SFLpunk and imagineiii for making this possible, and ensuring that quite a few people in the DC circle will get to try this one out. First 750 is all for me. Nothing like having over a dozen tickable pours all to myself. 

Served in a Hill Farmstead long-stem tulip glass.

Pours a moderately-hazy bright apricot color with a strong two-finger white head. Fairly fluffy. Theres some good retention and gobs and gobs of spotty lacing as it goes down the glass. Good collar and -- appropriately -- a galaxy-swirl cap on top throughout. 

The nose starts out with some very, very strong citrus. Lots of grapefruit and orange rind. Some tropical mango in the background. Some more hops. Then some more. Damn. As it warms, the grapefruit takes a bit over from the orange and tropical notes. One of the better smelling DIPAs that Ive come across. Me giving something a 5.0 is rare. It being a DIPA that doesnt feature Citra is even rarer. Im not a Citra fanboy at all :) (Thats right, a smiley face in a review...Im pretty sure Ive never done that before.)

The flavor begins with some supremely-aggressive hop components. Grapefruit pith abounds. Looking for serious hop action? Whoop, there it is. Smiley face? Check. Old-school ""ashamed to have had singed and danced to"" song? Check. Rolling on all cylinders tonight. Reference to Brian Regan. Class act. 

Other than the all-out grapefruit assault, theres some malt in the background. Who am I kidding? No theres not. Its all hops. This is what a double IPA should be. As has been a frequent topic of forum discussions, no, hops dont belong everywhere. Straight fact, though: malt does not belong in an American Imperial IPA. It simply does not. Thats an American Barleywine. Shaun gets an A+ here for brewing a beer that is an all-out hop assault that I never need a break from. The bitterness and flavor both take me to the brink, but never off the edge. So much hop flavor and bitterness all in one package.

Medium body with a brisk, crisp bitterness and moderate carbonation. No real alcohol character. Strong bitterness. Then some hop fruitiness. Nearly a flawless beer. Now, given that this review is about eleventy billion times my average review length, I think Ill call it quits. Cheers.

1168,"2011-05-04",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2016 Poured from a growler straight from the Farm!  Poured a cloudy orange with a puffy 2 finger head.  Aroma of Fresh Philippines Mango, Freshly peeled Grapefruit, Fresh Pine - Very inviting.  Very nice Hop Bitterness with A big taste of Pine, Citrus Fruits and Fruit Salad at the end.  Dont go here looking for a Ruination-styled Palate Bomb - This was very well balanced.  Perfect Carbonation for this style.   A very drinkable Double IPA!","","Johnsense"
1168,"2011-05-04",3.9,"Growler sample via and shared with oakbluff. Muddy orange in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are of white grapefruit, sour peach, cut grass, tropical fruit, and faint pine and pale malt. Its all about the hops in the mouth with grapefruit rind, papaya, mango and wet grass. Quite dry on the palate with a firm bitterness that seems to build as drinking continues. Skews a bit too much towards the tropical for my personal taste, but I like the intensity of the hops overall along with the body and bitterness levels. Good stuff.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1168,"2011-05-04",4.0,"Growler from my main HF man Glouglouburp - pours a muddy orange with a nice frothy white head. Nose - mango, grassy hops.  Taste- big tropical fruit punch followed with grassy  and pine notes. Very resinous and has a lingering white grapefruit rind bitterness.  Some sweet pale malts also come through but by and large a fairly dry dipa.  This is one helluva hop monster- very unique offering.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","oakbluff"
1168,"2011-05-03",3.7,"Growler pour at DLD from Kan. Thanks! My first HF beer and gotta say, not a bad way to start. Pours a hazy gold  with a sticky white head. Nose is citrusy and passionfruit. Some resiny mango notes peek through as well. On taste, not crazy bitter, but has a fair amount nonetheless a bit light in the bittering department. Soft malts come across as well to accompany the refreshing tropical fruit notes. Not too bad at all.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, vibrant fruity hops with citrusy lemon, grapefruit, grass, florals. Into a medium body with good bread, pale malts, grainy, a sturdy dry hop with great citrus appeal which is a little sharp, with great hop presence, alphas.

1168,"2011-05-01",4.1,"Rating #2000!!!  Growler filled at the brewery.  Pours a very murky dirty orange with a small white head.  Aroma of very pungent grapefruit (in a good way!), citrus, grassy hops, garlicky hops, and a tinge of malt.  Flavor of citrus (less grapefruity in the mouth), more caramel malt, and a resiny hops finish.  Awesome stuff.

1168,"2011-04-24",4.0,"On tap at the brewpub. Poured a hazy gold with a white head that lasted throughout the beer and laced nicely. Aroma was full of citrus and tropical fruit with a bit of bitterness from a pine and grapefruit note. Bit of a sweet grain backbone as well. Flavor started with citrus and tropical fruit but became a bit more resinous with pine coming through and a nice grain backing.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

Appearance : Hazy pale yellow.

Aroma : Resinous and herbal hops. Nice fruits.

Taste : Resinous and piny hops, nice fruity passion fruits. Finish is quite persistent with resinous and fruity notes.

Overall : Nice one. Interesting new hop. Very fruity and quite resinous/piny. Alcohol is well hidden. Very enjoyabnle but this didnt ""wowed"" me as much as Abner.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
1168,"2011-04-18",4.4,"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a frothy two finger pillowy white head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with chunks of soapy lacing.

Another incredible smelling beer from Hill Farmstead. They really know how to nail down the nose on an IPA(all of their beers for that matter). This beer is exploding with tropical an citrus fruit notes which are nicely complimented by the floral earthy, notes and faint pale malt. Hints of pineapple, mango, grapefruit and citrus peel alongside grassy, piny hops and sweet biscuit malts.

I tried Ephraim before this and while that beer looked and smelled incredible, the flavor and palate let me down so my expectations for Galaxy werent the highest. Thankfully this beer lived up to the appearance and nose. Chewy medium body with an complex, delicious flavor profile. Again, as in the aroma, the palate is bursting forth with sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hints of papaya, pineapple and mango as well as a boat load of citrus rind. This is countered by an earthy resinous pine bitterness that creates excellent balance and makes this beer dangerously drinkable. Theres also some faint biscuit pale malt adding to the balance and complexity and there is little to no heat, resulting n an excellently masked ABV. I was very impressed with this beer. I highly recommend that you seek it out.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1168,"2011-04-17",3.9,"Verre de 10 oz, au Siboire. Arômes très invitants de houblon citronné et résineux. Belle robe pêche et trouble, délicate mousse et effervescence moyenne. Très puissante en bouche, la bière montre une très belle présence de houblon fruité (citron, pamplemousse rose) et résineux. Le malt est mielleux et légèrement sucré et présente une très belle texture veloutée. Légère présence dalcool réchauffant en finale et très forte amertume résineuse. Très bon !","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
1168,"2011-04-17",4.2,"Wonderful. On tap at Threepenny in Montpelier. Huge fluffy head, hazy orange head. Fresh leaf aroma. Flavor of sweet, crystal malt balanced with intense hop flavors, very dry bitter finish. Mmmmm....","Mount Vernon, Iowa, USA","GJF"
1168,"2011-04-17",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This Double IPAs acrobatic aromatics develop a jungles worth of citrus fruit exploding over and within a soft and lean body meant to showcase this potent hop variety. This is quite intense and extremely bitter, but it does everything well.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the misty amber.
-This might not have the complexity of Abner or Ephraim, but it is a hugely flavorful Double IPA nonetheless.
-The grassy, resinous bitterness might be a tad too abrasive for my tastes in Double IPAs.
-The tropical fruit character is pungently citrusy, with passionfruit, peaches, lychees and pineapples all around.

1168,"2011-04-16",4.2,"Draft at Blind Tiger with daddy James. The version we tried was labelled, ""Double Galaxy,"" so Im not sure if it was a different brew, but I think this is the one. Anyway, the pour was a turbid bright Mandarin orange with a decent layering of fine, creamy off-white head upon the surface. Aroma is bursting forth with grassy, herbal, piney hop notes that balance perfectly the boquet of citrus fruits; grapefruit, oranges, lemon zest, and hints of mango. The body is very taught, lean, and yet oddly roomy with an astringent, tongue-drying palate full of hoppy bitterness. The finish is smooth, tangy, and delicate. Not much alcohol taste in this Galaxy guy, just a perfectly proporitioned dose of some juicy, resnious hops.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"
1168,"2011-04-11",4.1,"Draft. Pours orange with a white head. Fruity citric aroma with orange fruity notes, and light piney notes. The flavor is not quite as citric as the aroma, but a good amount of hop flavor, light pine, and a solid bitter hoppy finish. Nice.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
1168,"2011-04-11",4.5,"Draft at Blind Tiger with Pat and Pitel. This was one of my overall favorite offerings from Hill Farmstead between the two events at RnH and BT.
