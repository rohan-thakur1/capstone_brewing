Mouthfeel is light body, light crisp carbonation, slightly metallic floral vanilla aftertaste. Overall, its very crushable.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
433,"2016-08-19",2.9,"Drank from a glass poured from a bottle, 
this beer was a dark yellow in the glass, there was a little orange at the side and a faint haze in the glass, 
the pour gave almost a one finger white cover, 

this drink had light aromas of citrus hops, malt, a bit of bread, faint grain and a little dough, the vanilla was in the background, 
there was some malt sweetness, 

the flavors were light malt and grain, citrus and spice hops, faint vanilla and some malt/bread sweetness, 
the finish had a light citrus hop bitterness, 

this beer had a light mouth feel, it was a little creamy and soft to lively carbonation, 

the hops were stronger on the nose and flavor than I expected for a cream ale, 
it was a nice drinking beer.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

433,"2016-06-28",2.9,"Pours a pale yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma is subtle vanilla, floral hops, and bread malts. Flavor is lightly sweet bread malts, corn, and some vanilla. A touch light on the vanilla. Has a light, lively body. This is ok, a little blander than I expected.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"

433,"2016-06-02",3.5,"Tap. Pale golden with one finger head. Ive never been terribly impressed with right brain, but this is pretty good. Light body. Sweet and bready with substantial vanilla. A nice combination.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
433,"2016-03-16",3.9,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, corn, vanilla, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, vanilla, and light-moderate earthy hop/yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, corn, vanilla, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, corn, vanilla, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt, vanilla, and light-moderate earthy hop/yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness and lower body. Medium-high carbonation and light bodied; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly grainy/creamy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very nice creamy ale style! All around good robustness and balance of pale malt, vanilla, and light-moderate earthy hop/yeast ester flavors; and very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

433,"2016-01-21",3.2,"Pour on tap, clear orange pour with white head, aroma brought vanilla, grass, bread, biscuit, some slight honey, hints of grain. Taste was a mix of bread, grass, slight fruit, hints of honey into vanilla bean, finishing slightly sweet.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
433,"2016-01-12",3.5,"Pours golden with a white head. Aroma hints at vanilla. Pretty light body with a subtle vanilla flavor without being sweet.","Massachusetts, USA","two7offsuit"
433,"2015-11-18",5.0,"The deep rich yellow color of cake, with a stark white foamy head resembling frosting, cakewalk is an easy drinking desert. while it isnt too sweat is is very much creamy with strong and prominent vanilla undertones. I normally dont like cream ales but I fell in love with this beer this summer in Traverse City.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","mckieran"
433,"2015-10-16",3.2,"Tap at Slows. From notes. Weak aroma. Mostly vanilla with some underlying stale hops. Tastes smooth. Creamy body goes well with the vanilla flavor but theres not much. Decent but boring.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
433,"2013-10-25",3.7,"Tap: golden-amber with nice clarity & a frothy, thin white skin that settles atop the beaming brew, leaving some sheety lacing behind. Aroma is toasted grains, some stale & musty hops, thick lager yeast, a touch of lemon zest, & only the mildest hint of vanilla. Almost cream soda like in the finish, but the vanilla isnt too pronounced. Taste is crisp with slight bitterness, musty, earthy, & dirty hops (seemingly Noble) with lemon & citrus zest. Grains, bready yeast, & again, a very faint vanilla finishing note. I wish the vanilla was more pronounced, but this is a damn fine cream ale nonetheless. Have to respect the style for its drinkability, especially next to a medium rare burger.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
433,"2013-07-29",2.6,"On tap at Right Brain Brewery, Traverse City, Michigan, pours a very light pale color with a white head. Nose is flat, maybe some subtle vanilla. Taste is not full of much flavor, mild vanilla and some sweetness. Finish is short, and dull. Not their best. Quaff Score 6 / 10","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","jjgmd"
433,"2013-07-29",2.8,"On tap at Right Brain Brewery in Traverse City. Pours a golden yellow with a white head and malty, sweet aroma. Taste is light, of malt, caramel, and a light touch of vanilla with a smooth, creamy finish. Light but drinkable","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","zgaier"
