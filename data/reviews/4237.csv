4237,"2016-12-29",3.3,"Tap at GABF. Pours a cloud yellow with thick white head leaving sticky lacing. The aroma is yeast, spice, grapefruit, lemon zest. Medium body, spice, grapefruit, yeast, light tartness, good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
4237,"2015-11-17",4.3,"Pours a cloudy, pale golden yellow color with banana-like hues and a one finger, frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Good retention with steaks of soapy lace left behind. Visible carbonation bubbling up as well. 

Musty farmhouse aroma with earthy oak, zesty spice, banana bread, citrus rind and vinous light fruit. Subtle dry oak/toothpick complimenting the earthy saison character. Nice peppery spice presence with some coriander and clove in there. Vinous light fruit notes with light grape and white raisin. Sweet citrus pith with lemon peel/juice and grapefruit. Was expecting more grapefruit in the nose but Im pickin up more funk, wine and lemon. 

On the lower end of medium body with soft carbonation thats perfect for the style. Mouthfeel is very nice and the flavors are complex yet nicely balanced. Peppery spice up front with musty brett/farmhouse funk and a very strong citrus presence that lingers over the bread/yeast, light fruit and dry oak into a sweet, slightly dry finish. Grapefruit is much stronger than in the nose and nicely compliments the vinous barrel and lighter fruits. Nice white white presence with light grape and golden raisin but the barrel/oak is very faint. Complex and very flavorful yet its light and easy to drink. ABV is invisible. A lot of really nice flavors bouncing off of each other. Each sip reveals something different and everything blend together very well. The grapefruit juice/rind is a really nice addition to an already great beer.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

4237,"2013-09-29",3.7,"Enjoyed on tap at Wild Monk. Served in a tulip.

A: Pours a clear gold color with a thick white head forming on the pour. Recedes slowly to a thick cap that leaves tons of soapy lace down the glass.

S: Huge grapefruit. on the nose. A ton of bright zest and intense flesh. The sweetness of the grapefruit is captured and it doesnt impart any tart or acidic notes. The base is only mildly present in the nose.

T: The grapefruit is much subdued in the taste which is a slight disappointment. The base saison is much more prevalent with some light peppery notes and fruity esters. Sweet wheat notes with some light zesty grapefruit. Mild pithy bitterness.

M: Very light and crisp with a medium high carbonation. Great drinkability. Zesty sweet finish.

O: The nose was fantastic, but the taste was lacking that grapefruit pop and was not all that different from regular Sofie. Having said that I still enjoyed this beer and would gladly have it again.

In fact, blindfolded I would guess wine in the glass. I get peach and nectarine more than grapefruit. The taste is slightly sweet up front from the juice followed by the familiar farmhouse funk. It finishes by leaving a sour taste in the back of your throat and a wheat malt kiss on the tip of your tongue. Its a nice blend of sweet and tart.

4237,"2013-06-04",3.8,"On draft at Bad Apple in Chicago. Big lemon-citrus mixed with tart apple cider in the aroma.  Appearance is a pale yellow with deep foam on top that disappears quickly.  Taste was yeasty, sweet, tart, citrus and fruit abundant, cider-ish. Its a good, light, sparkling white wine-oriented fruit beer. Palate was lively with carbonation but light in body.  Overall, good and mouth coating with flavor.  Even though this isnt my favorite style, cheers to Goose Island for making a pale-colored and bold fruit beer.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

4237,"2013-05-21",3.7,"Draft at Churchkey. Well I had had some Sofie before, but this didnt even resemble its base beer. Poured a vibrant, hazy golden peach hue with a thick white head like meringue. Aroma is full on grapefruit - the rind really comes out in this one. Flavor is like a juicy, tart grapefruit - almost like just drinking a glass of that. Nice tart notes, spice character still remains just enough. I think I had hoped for a little bit more with this one, I like grapefruit but it unfortunately made this one a bit one-note for me. I dont think I could handle more than a pint of this one at a time unless it radically changes as it warms.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
