1052,"2017-01-22",4.8,"Pours an oily black color with a small, dark brown head, which vanishes immediately.

The aromas of this are simply amazing - theres a lot going on with licorice, scorched malts, tobacco and dark chocolate. The barrel adds a tremendous depth with dried apples, rock sugar, peppers, dried plum and lots of spicy wood, tickling the nose by developing a boozy warmth.

Drinks silk and velvet, full bodied with lots and lots of alcohol soaked layers of rich maltiness. 

Tastes right from the beginning of burned malts, wild honey, whipped cream as for its awesome mouthfeel, and fudge. Develops a spicy licorice roastiness once the barrel gets noteable, together with cinnamon, toasted nuts and a luscious amount of bitter chocolate. Finishes with molasses, melting chocolate, long lasting tobacco, dried earth and a flowery note from the otherwise still pleasantly spicy barrel.

This is like an amped up Bourbon County - not necessarily thicker on the tongue, but even creamier with more roast and bitter chocolate, countered by an even sweeter fudge note, balanced by earth and spices. Awesomly intense and balanced throughout.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1052,"2016-11-25",4.2,"Bottle, shared by a (crazy generous) friend from high school. Everything about the initial appearance of this beer is impressive. Its jet-black with a mocha-white head, and it pours into the glass like a viscous oil. The aroma is moderate bourbon and sweet chocolate. The taste leans more towards the traditional Russian Imperial Stouts Ive had, with more sweetness and dark fruit than chocolate or coffee, and the bourbon barrel flavor is reasonably restrained, giving some undertones and aroma, but mostly allowing the malt to take center stage.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
1052,"2016-11-14",4.4,"Bottle. Black black black. Aroma is chocolate, cocoa, very fudgy and a little bready. Taste is sweet, coffee and chocolate, rich and thick, chewy, gorgeous. Wow.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
1052,"2016-11-03",4.1,"Bottled April 13, 2015, drunk 10/21/16, thanks to Blisscent.The usual perfect pour from a bottled HF product. Dark ebony-cocoa body of undetermined clarity. Large, dense head, strong retention, etc....Right away the first thing I notice is that its significantly less boozy than the port barrel version, which is odd since this is much younger than when I had the port. Anyways, bourbon character is moderate, definitely a big portion of the nose, but not dominant and its backed by cocoa, prunes, fudge and very even, mild roast. Vanilla, graham cracker and caramel on the finish, show the malt depth and the bourbon dries out the finish, with spicy liquor notes and light wood. Low on the alcohol, with just a hint of warmth and no flaws.Rich, of course, in the mouth with plentiful bourbon notes backed by rich fudgey malts. Cocoa, cola, cherry, vanilla and caramel all present a fairly straightforward Imperial as the chalky, mineral-rich water of HF works its magic on the less tangible character of the beer. Velvety, but not syrupy, malty but not cloying, with tight carbonation and very light alcohol warmth. Delightful. Thanks, Nelson.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1052,"2016-10-30",4.4,"Thanks Adamchandler. What a gem. Both him and the beer ;). Anyway, this rocks. Pours thick and black with faint dark head that immediately disappears.

Phenomenal.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","cards04"
1052,"2016-10-23",4.5,"Bottle shared with koleminer20, Chris, and Doug for the Lions share. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, barrel, coffee, robust. Appearance is black, brown head, poured thick. Taste is roasted malt, licorice, chocolate, bourbon, barrel, complex and great. Mouthfeel is heavy body, light carbonation, chocolate and barrel aftertaste. Overall, really really good.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
1052,"2016-10-16",4.5,"500ml bottle. Black pour with red hues and a foamy mahogany head.

1052,"2016-10-13",4.1,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kellys Island Bottle Share on September 18. 500 mL bottle. Ive been excited about this for a while. The pour is a thinner black with a light brown head that falls slowly to a collar leaving a couple spots of lace. The aroma has a lot of barrel and bourbon on it. There is a good sweet molasses and a nice dark chocolate. A hint of vanilla pokes in and does well. The flavor is better. There is a light bourbon and molasses at the front end. A good charred oak and dark chocolate vanilla combo roll in slowly, and there is a dark fruit on the finish. Its really complex, but its missing that wow factor. The mouth feel is a little thin and light. There is a nice soft carbonation and a lingeringly sweet molasses and chocolate to go with a hint of bourbon and a light vanilla on the finish. Excellent stout.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1052,"2016-10-12",4.4,"My Bottom Line:
This luxurious Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout lays rich bourbon vanilla atop dark fruit jam, burnt caramel and bitter roastiness, in a most velvety mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the impenetrable black.
-Molasses is also found in the flavour profile.
-There is a lot going on here, but every flavour works in the same direction.
-The roasty bitterness balances the heavy sugars perfectly.
-You obviously need to be in the mood for dessert for this one. But when you are, oh my
-Smoked blue cheese was perfect for this one.

1052,"2016-08-08",4.2,"Poured from a 04/13/2016 bottle. 
Aroma is fairly malt forward with a lot of balanced dark chocolate and roast notes. Some faint caramel and toffee notes. Medium bourbon notes with some lighter oak and alcohol spice. Hints of dark fruit and raisins. Some light tobacco and ash notes. 
Pours black with thick, dark mocha head that steadily recedes to the edges then lingers. No lacing and moderate legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with lots of roast and chocolate malt notes. Light tobacco and ash notes. Medium bourbon notes with some light oak character. Low bitterness and light alcohol spice. Lingering dark chocolate notes with a touch of milk chocolate. 
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium low carbonation; a bit of creaminess. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty nice stout. I think I like this more than the port barrel one. Nice chocolate flavors with great malt complexity. Balanced roast with hints of tobacco and ash.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
1052,"2016-08-05",4.1,"Apparence : Noire opaque, coule visqueuse, anneau brun foncé, carbonatation très faible. 
Nez : Mélasse, réglisse ooire, effluves de vanille, de chocolat noir, de bois et dalcool fort. 
Goût : Mélasse et réglisse noire en entrée, suivies de notes torréfiées pour finir sur des notes de bois alcoolisé et, en moindre mesures, de chocolat noir. Légère amertume, assez sucrée. 
Sensation : Effervescence quasi absente, pleine, picotement éthylique sur la langue, chaleur élevée en gorge, bonne longueur. 
Bref : Une bière qui, à mon goût, est axée sur les saveurs de mélasse tout de même sucrée avec du chocolat et le fut pour équilibrer ce qui aurait été bière débalancée et beaucoup trop sucrée à mon avis. Très bonne intensité et plaisir à la boire. 
Je dois par contre avouer être quelque peu dubitatif de la réputation dont cette bière jouit. Je crois que celle-ci est due en bonne partie à la bière elle-même (elle est excellente, nen doutons pas), en partie au nom de la brasserie et une autre petite partie à la rareté de la bouteille. De plus, mes impressions des saveurs dune bière rejoignent habituellement ce que la majorité des gens en disent, mais ici, jai eu droit à un profil auquel je ne mattendais pas (beaucoup de mélasse). Excellente, mais peut-être pas de classe mondiale à mon humble avis!","Quebec, CANADA","Adamsville"

1052,"2015-11-12",4.0,"Huge thanks to sideshowe for sharing. Bottle 281. 

Pours a dark chestnut brown color that appears black and opaque in the glass. Half finger dark mocha head that quickly settles into a lasting ring leaving spotty lacing behind.

Smokey, roasted malt aroma with subtle barrel integration. Some toasted oak and subtle booziness with more of an oak and peaty scotch presence than sweet, boozy bourbon. There a faint malt backbone with some smoke, dark chocolate, coffee bean and oatmeal but the oak and peat notes overpower things a bit. 

Medium bodied with a nice smokey barrel presence thats nicely integrated into the dark malts of the base beer. Smokey, peaty scotch flavor with toasted oak, ash, smoked meat and burnt malt along with subtle vanilla and dry oak. This is countered by a balance of sweet and roasted dark malt flavors with hints of dark chocolate, toast, coffee bean and oatmeal. Well balanced with a nicely integrated barrel presence, however, Im getting more of a dry oak than bourbon flavor. Complex with a well masked ABV that makes it easy to drink but theres something a touch off that i cant put mu finger on. Still, an enjoyable beer that Im glad to have tried.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1052,"2015-09-06",4.1,"500 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle # 723/864. Originally reviewed
10/29/2012. Small khaki head. Not quite inky. Wispy lacing.

Smells of tons of black patent malt. Light bourbon. A big oaky presence, more than the bourbon and vanilla.
Lots more barrel blends into the flavor. Bourbon is still light, but vanilla and caramel come out. Dark fruit flavor right at the front, which might be a byproduct of the alcohol and black patent malt. Lots of molasses. Gives it a bitter flavor in the back. Bitter. Not really chewy, but easy to drink at this ABV. The molasses gives it a sweet flavor that implies viscosity, without it actually being there.

Second time having this it was significantly better than the first. I was also smashed the first time. It would be really good with more barrel presence.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Lean liquorice roast throughout and softly sweet initial taste. Dank steamy choc, dark without being full clown cocoa bitterness. Neat bitterness in the back end. Smooth and creamy without being overly cloying and a nice aniseedy bitter pinch on the lift. Finish is not dissimilar, evenly paced and a linger of liquorice and roast blackcurrants.

Very robust, yet delicate & pedantic all at once. The flavor is excellent, & has a nice German Chocolate Cake vibe to it; dense chocolate mixing with a hint of coconut & vanillin from the barrel. Woody & slightly tannic mid-palate, but not overdone. Smooth bourbon lathered throughout.

1052,"2014-05-02",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2015 Bottles kindly shared by Tom 10101 & JHuxley during our epic CMLSG cellar tasting - all 3 versions put next to each other. All of them have an incredibly nice balance between sweetness and roastiness which is unparallelled vs. other American BA RISs, which make them all great beers.
- Damon: 3.9/5: subtle vanilla and cocoa in the aromas
- Damon PBA;: 4.2/5: my favourite: more depth and complexity. Nose reveils cigars, leather, red fruits. Taste is roasty with a nice vinious touch of raisins. 
- Damon DBA 4/5: despite the fact that it is the most balanced in the nose, I think the taste is a tad bland.

Thanks to DocJ007 for sharing this one with us last weekend, Batch #2.


A - Pours jet black with a small half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light ring around the edge of the glass, leaving little to no lace at all on the glass.


S - Smells of warm bourbon, fudgey chocolate, vanilla, molasses, dark fruits, overly charred oak and plenty of dark roasted malt. Lots of dark aromas lurking in the shadows of this one.


T - Starts off much like the nose does with a bit sugary kick - mainly the fudgey chocolate, vanilla, molasses mixed dark fruits - quickly being joined by the smokey charred oak and base dark roasted malts. Finish is much like before with a mix of sweetness and dark roasty flavors, lingering long after the finish.


M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. Slick feel throughout, booze is hidden quite well.


O - I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Not as good as when I had it on-tap but still a very enjoyable beer. Really looking forward to trying that Double Barrel version in the near future.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
1052,"2014-01-03",3.8,"500ml bottle. Huge thanks to Dany. Aroma is sweet bourbon. Very subtitle. Taste is bourbon, smoke, oak, cane sugar. Everything is blended very well, not an extreme beer but very well balanced. Good stuff but not worth the crazy hype.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
1052,"2014-01-01",3.8,"2011 vintage shared at Perennial. Original review 06-26-12.

Pours black, mocha-colored head, wisps, thin collar. This is a Blantons/bourbon bomb straight away! After the huge booze, theres roasted malts, chocolate, light bread, caramel, oak, very subtle hops, and burnt sugars. The booze flairs my nostrils...woah. I think this beer needs to additional cellar time to lose some of the booze. The palate offers lots of bourbon, oak, chocolate, light vanilla, caramel, and toasted malts. The alcohol is very noticeable, which detracts from the rest of the beer. Finish is chocolate and booze with light oak. Medium to full body, good carbonation, rich, creamy finish.

While I like this beer, I want to like it more. I think another 6 months to a year of additional cellar time will do this beer some good. I will revisit then and update when I have it again. Right now, I suggest holding your bottles unless you really want a bunch of alcohol with your RIS (which some people prefer). In summary, good now but is destined to be great in the future.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

Damn, the flavor is like drinking a chocolate cake soaked in smooth bourbon. Chocolate cake batter upfront, anise and light hints of coffee all the while a nice smooth bourbon nuance in the finish. The texture is slick and oily which is consistent with the motor oil look in the glass. Leaves a slick, sticky feel on the tongue. Slight warming sensation after the sip, yet no intense burn, real mild. If Mr. Hill release this again next year, I sugeest you take a drive to HFS and stand in line for six hours to get this.

Liqueur-like warming sensation. Never thought Id say this but I feel it would benefit from a light carbonation. Very smooth. Most certainly a slow sipper.

Decadent aroma of chocolate fudge and bourbon barrels upfront with some vanilla and subtle espresso beans further back. Flavour is rich and decadent, with more of the chocolate fudge, more dominant bourbon barrels than the nose suggests, and a prominent alcohol burn. Balanced beautifully between these three main qualities, leaving a chocolately alcohol burn on the finish. Almost zero carbonation - usually I wouldnt complain about this, but in this case (as Matts_Property says), I think slightly higher carbonation would benefit the mouthfeel.

1052,"2012-08-13",4.4,"In short: A superior BA Imperial Stout that doesnt overdo anything.  Classy beer
How: Tap at brewery + bottle aged about 4 months (this rating)
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head with good retention
In long: Nose is moderately bourbon with some nice fresh bakery black chocolate and freshly roasted coffee beans.  Not sure what his trick is, I can understand that HF makes IPAs that proposes a superb freshness in the aroma, but now even his BA Imperial Stout are a breath a freshness.  Taste is more of the same, a perfect execution of simplicity.  Fresh bakery chocolate, some bourbon but not too much, a good amount a superior quality coffee beans, mild notes of vanilla, grilled marshmallows, medium oak barrels presence, rich chocolate fudge, medium roast level, still enough hops presence to provide some kind of balance.  No alcohol presence and a sweetness sensation lower than expected.  This is once again too easy to drink for a high gravity beer, a recurrent theme with Hill Farmstead beers.  Basically it has almost all the basic elements of the style minus the fruity flavors, but what makes this one stand out is not the intensity or a specific flavor element, what makes this one stand out is how perfectly levelled each flavor element is and how drinkable it is for the style.  If youre looking for a brutal boozy sugar bomb (very popular on ratebeer) then this is not the beer for you, but if youre looking for class and refinement, this is the BA Imperial Stout you want.  I really loved that beer, even the 89.5% part that is not alcohol.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1052,"2012-03-27",4.1,"500ml bottle, 2011 vintage, #490/864.  Nearly pitch black, the dense body supports a thin, swirly, light brown film, leaving behind a soapy, glass-staining wash that slowly rejoins the body.  Based in lush, über-rich, bittersweet dark chocolate, the velvety-smooth malts suggest of caramel and toasted brownie.  An overlying wash of smooth, wood-kissed bourbon, spicy vanilla bean, and mild smoke wrap everything up beautifully.  Flavors follow right in line.  Wave after wave of rich dark chocolate and lightly scorched caramel are quite sweet, touching also on dulce de leche, soft vanilla, fading green hops, and lush, lush bourbon.  Super smooth and expertly balanced.  The palate is nearly full, yet light enough to show some life.  Theres a (welcomed) lightly papery texture that keeps things from getting overly syrupy, yet the sugars do a good job of covering up the alcoholic heat.  Damn fine beer.

Layers of rich fresh coffee beans, anise, dark fruits, super dark gooey chocolate cake.  Finish is a brilliant collage of bakers chocolate, lightly roasted malts, and a barrel kiss that is totally unique in its own right.  As with Birth of Tragedy its almost blackberry-like at times.  Palate medium.  A sort of empty spot on the palate, a bit thin at times, otherwise excellent.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
1052,"2012-03-03",4.2,"500mL thanks to oteyj. Rating #3500. Pours pretty much ink with a thicker reddish mocha head. Nice retention with wispy, sticky dark lace. Nose is pretty sweet, cinnamon, spicy Mexican chocolate, sharp vanilla bean and dark chocolate ice cream. Oh yeah. Incredible crystalized sugared chocolate nose. So much powerful vanilla dark chocolate brownie mix. Taste is silky, thicker, bitter, sugary dark chocolate. Oh man this is good. Excellent bitter dark chocolate palate. Thick Godiva liquor palate is of the charts. Delicious. 8/4/8/5/17=4.2","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1052,"2012-03-02",4.5,"Got this about a week ago and left it in the mini fridge at 50f to settle.Pours a black color with a medium frothy dark brown head that slowly dissipates. Color has a crimson hue on the edges but cant see through the black liquid. Smell is chocolate caramel with a clean roast. Plenty of oak vanilla and spirit chacteristics. After it sits the edge of spirit gives way to vanilla and chocolate. Taste is rich dark caramel with a smooth roastiness and vanilla. Clean spirit characteristics without the alcohol fume. There is a sweetness but a bite of bitterness, semi sweet dry finish.  mouth feel is silky smooth, full body with mild carbonation. Creamy coating every tastebud. overall this may be, nay, is my favorite bb stout ever.","New Jersey, USA","fbm115"
1052,"2012-02-26",4.2,"Opaque black with a medium sized, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of roasted malts, lighter vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, and light alcohol. Taste was more roasty, lighter wood, bourbon, dark fruits, and alcohol in the finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1052,"2012-02-26",4.2,"Huge thanks to yourefragile for sharing this bottle. No Hill Farmstead tulip; damn my early packing. Bottle number 578/864.

Pours near black with a good tan head and some spotty, streaky lacing on the way down. The nose carries a great dose of bourbon and chocolate with some very mild roast in the background. Flavor has big bourbon and oak with some accompanying vanilla. Medium body with smooth carbonation. Über smooth. Really fantastic. Just a touch of booze for warmth. Fantastic.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
1052,"2012-02-24",4.7,"Poured into a Portsmouth tulip.  Thick pitch-black body with a thin dark-tan head.  Looks beautiful.  Leaves some nice lacing on the glass.  The nose is packed with cocoa, bourbon, wood and vanilla.  Smells amazing.  Roasty with a touch of booze.  On the tongue its sweet bourbon and vanilla up front, but then finishes with a wave of dark chocolate and some dry, earthy, dark malt bitterness on the tail end.  The 10% abv is noticeable, but doesnt get in the way of taste or enjoyment.  Very drinkable for a barrel aged imperial stout.  The body is smooth and creamy with light carbonation.  Overall, this is phenomenal, but Hill Farmstead never disappoints.  Damon is drinking excellently now, but Im sure it will hold up or even get better in the years to come.  Beautiful.","New Hampshire, USA","sisuspeed"
1052,"2012-02-23",4.2,"Bottle from the recent release.  Poured oily black with brown shallow head.  Aroma was raw bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, and ash.  Taste was amazing with subtle to strong flavor notes of vanilla, chocolate, wood, coffee, with a light roasty sweetness and a dry flavorful finish.  Really a tasty treat that I think will improve with age.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1052,"2012-02-22",4.3,"Bottle from release! Wow!!! So much vanilla, oak, bourbon, that tasty roasty alcohol hot finish. Fucking shit","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1052,"2012-02-21",4.4,"Huge thanks to oteyj for bringing this back from the release!!! Inky black pour with a bubbly brown head. The nose is incredibly sweet but oh so luscious, with amazing notes of rich chocolate ganache, black cherry, vanilla bourbon sweetness, rich cream and milk, Belgian truffle, and an awesome but ever so light spiciness that presumably is a sort of imparting of whiskey from the barrel into that sweet chocolate. The flavor brings increased bitter bakers chocolate and cacao, along with gorgeous refined vanilla, oak, and bourbon. A touch of creaminess sneaks in as well, reminiscent of Peche Mortel for the slightest instant. The palate is soft and a bit slick from the barrel treatment, but the finish reverts to that beautiful roasted dryness, which I love. This is phenomenal.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
1052,"2012-02-18",4.8,"Picked this up at the February Hill Farmstead Release. Paid $17 for a bottle. Poured into a Hill Farmstead Glass.

A - Deep dark pour into the glass. No head was produced at all. Looks like Im pouring cane syrup into a glass. Nice alcohol fingers on the glass while swirling. No light comes through and the edges are a very dark amber color.

S - HUGE bourbon scent and oak barrels. Both the bourbon and barrels give up a terrific scent the lights up the nose. This is followed by roasted malts, sweet chocolate / cocoa and candied yams.

T - Three largest tastes in this beer. Bourbon, Oak, Chocolate. Everything else just fades away. Im getting a heavy, high-cocoa fresh belgian chocolate. The wood and bourbon in this is NOT over powering and is so well balanced to a well crafted Imperial Stout. 

M - A hard swish yields about 15% bubbles and the liquid mostly stays completely liquid. Heavy heavy body. The alcohol and malt just lingers for days! Exceptional.

O - This may be the best beer Ive ever had. Nothing else to say.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
1052,"2012-02-18",4.5,"Gloopy motor oil pour with a thick rich brown head. The nose holds huge bourbon vanilla notes with sweet mocha, a hints of booze, and a load of chocolate. The flavor is truly mindblowing: milk chocolate and cocoa nibs swirl together with caramel and backstrap molasses to creating a sweet swirling torrent of Imperial Stout glory. A hint of drier, more roasty notes come through near the end, with bakers chocolate and roasted malts. Exceptionally smooth and balanced for a style that often goes over the top with over zealous barreling. The palate is ultra thick and ultra rich with low carbonation and a heavy velvety texture. The finish is sweet with a hint of balancing roast. Superlative.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
1052,"2012-02-11",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2012 Sampled at EBF Saturday afternoon.
Solid black color with an off white head. Aromas of bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Flavor follows the aroma quite well with a bit of a dry finish. Light body and level of carbonation with a sweet slick mouthfeel. Smells wonderful tastes pretty good but is a bit thin and finishes kind of dry. Im a bit disappointed with this one because the other Hill stuff Ive had has been exceptional. Maybe I can revisit this after the bottles come out. 

I was able to try this again out of a bottle on 5/11/2012, thanks Matt.
Pours a solid black with a thinnish tan head. Smells a lot of bourbon with chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee, roast, and a hint of smoke. Flavor is big and bold with the bourbon and the alcohol that comes with it. Roasty chocolate and coffee with hints of vanilla and oak in there. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a chewy sweet mouthfeel. I certainly enjoyed the sample I had out of the bottle much better than at the fest. This is a damn good stout and I do love me some stout. Its a shame these beers are so hard to come by.  My rating reflects my impression of the bottle version.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
1052,"2012-02-07",4.1,"Pouring at the Saturday afternoon session of EBF.  Pours a deep black to brown with a thin tan head.  Big and sweet on the nose, full of roast.  Cocoa, and heaps of big warm chocolate brownies.  Chewy chocolate and roast on the finish.  This was delicious.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
1052,"2012-02-05",4.1,"Lucky enough to try this on the Thursday before EBF when visiting the brewery - Sean pulled out a glass to share before it got kegged for the festival. Very very grateful as it was quite tasty...now just need to see if I can get a hold of a bottle or two. Black with no head, quite viscous. Some coffee and bittersweet chocolate, buttery, BA is not overwhelming - a nice balance of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Smooth, full body, low but suitable carbonation, nice constant mellow bourbon flavour along with a slight bitterness that is quite nice compared to some super sweet RIS. A stellar beer.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
