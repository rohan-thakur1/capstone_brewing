3183,"2011-06-22",2.8,"Bottle from Waitrose. We usually use this for cooking but I have been known to drink it occasionally when the wife isnt home (like now!). Inspired by cgarvieuk, I had this cold and warm. The sake is clear and still. The aroma is of yeast, rice and alcohol. The warmer version seemed to dull down the alcohol and it was a very Marmitey yeast aroma which suits me. Not the most complex sake but it does taste of rice with a lot of Marmite in there, nice lingering flavours and some sweetness. I agree with Craig that this is much better warm. Cold it just feels quite thin and the aromas and flavours dont hit you so much. Not bad but not my favourite either.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Benjii"

3183,"2007-05-18",3.2,"Bottle.  Like a white wine., lightly yellow, largely clear.  Aromas are earthy fungi, pepper, alcohol with some vanilla.  Flavours are sweet initially. Then quite dry with lots of pepper.  Mushroom notes.  Alcohol is obvious but clean.  Warming and crisp with some peppery notes.  Better than the one other Sake I have had.  Comforting.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
3183,"2007-05-04",0.8,"I think this perhaps wasnt in the best condition, perhaps the journey from japan to scotland hadnt done it much good and also it was sitting on the top shelf in blazing lights and heat in a chinese supermarket here. Aroma reminded me of a romanian spirit called swekka, not sure of spelling, off alcoholic plums. Taste was horrendus i forced myself to finish a half glass of this by downing in one, i was nearly sik and had to drink a serious ampount of water afterwards to get rid of the taste, it actually makes me a bit funny thinking about how horrible this stuff was, however in saing that it had a nice mouthfeel so browny points.","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"
