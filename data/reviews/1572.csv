1572,"2013-12-18",3.0,"Pours yellowish. Could have nicer legs. The nose is fruity and has ripe banana, cotton candy, and faint anise notes, but it is nothing too complex. On the palate, it displays its semi-dry character and medium body while the flavors follow the nose. The finish has a brash alcoholic taste and is a bit too bitter. The bouquet was the most pleasing part; decent overall if drunk chilled.","","Takemasta"

1572,"2013-08-15",2.9,"Pours out in a clear light vanilla colour with medium body. Nose of aromatic rice and peaches. Taste of berries, peaches, vanilla, grass and melon. Strong hints of rice. Finishes quite dry and little bit unpleasant....dull, too much alcohol, boring. Stronger than other Sakes around. Solid one.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
