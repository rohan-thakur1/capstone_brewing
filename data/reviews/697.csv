697,"2013-02-15",3.9,"On cask at Hay Merchant. Pours a very dark brown with medium creamy off white head leaving sticky lacing. The aroma is raisin oak and caramel. Medium mouthfeel with a strong oak flavor and light smokey finish. Alcohol present but not overpowering. A very good variation of the original.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
697,"2013-01-26",4.0,"On tap at the Winter Warmer 2012, this pours murky mahogany with a nice bubbly tan head that leaves light lacing. The nose is woody and of deep malts. The smooth, subtly soft palate contains very woody-oaked caramel and roasted grain flavors. A hint of whiskey finishes the pull, and with its complexities, what an awesome pull it is.

697,"2012-12-29",4.0,"Tap. Poured dark brown color with an average frothy brown head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate roasted malt, vanilla wood and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with sticky texture and flat carbonation. Heavy roasted sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

697,"2012-12-26",3.9,"On tap. Keg label has ""OAKED"" sticker slapped over it. Keg cap has ""AWO Med + Oaked Chub 9/6 Ready 9/18"" written on it. Im assuming this is the version Im rating (if anyone has any info otherwise please PM me). Dark brown color, light brown / tan head, good lace. Nice oaky nose. Very tasty vanilla and caramel malt flavor. Bigger body, smooth carbonation. Kind of creamy texture. Dry finish. Long oaky vanilla and scotch aftertaste. Light alcohol. Great beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
697,"2012-08-09",3.9,"Cask at PPD. Clear deep ruby with weak bubbles. Typical incorrect cask tapping from Pizzeria Paradiso. Nose is richer maple, smoke, black cherry liquor. Taste is still rich despite zero carbonation. Sharper red wine barrel tannins are a surprise. No whiskey flavor. 8/3/8/4/16=3.9","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Dark brown color, small tiny beige head. Nose has vanilla. Some wood and roasted notes. Medium-bodied. Sweet flavor, lots of vanilla, bourbon, plums, perhaps some smoke with toasted flavors. Nice oak aged brew.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"

looks  the same. the aroma and flavor are akin to chewing on a raw stave.... mixed with old chub. at times it throws out notes of bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla and toffee. oddly, lots of bourbon present though there is none here...only raw oak... weird. delicious in small amounts. 8/4/7/3/16","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"
697,"2012-02-01",3.2,"This one was full of barrel and at times it was really hard to find any Old Club in this one.  Woody and Boozy.  Which is totally fine with me because if you know me, I love that kind of stuff.   In the end I really liked it but would of loved to been able to taste some of the Old Chub.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

The beer pours a dark reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is excellent. I get a lot of chocolate with some peat notes. I also get some toffee and maple notes which compliment the other aromas very well. The flavor is also very nice. The main flavor is a chocolate and toffee malt mixture. I also get some vanilla, peat smoke and maple notes from the oak aging. The alcohol is detectable and the beer is very easy to drink. Medium, creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. An outstanding beer.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
