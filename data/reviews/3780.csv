3780,"2004-09-26",3.5,"This I liked, but maybe too much alcohol. After a day of tasting I bumped into this. Slight fruity nose along with nice malting. Spicy finish. A tad too heavy on the carbonation (a critique, not a complaint).","Beertimore, Maryland, USA","Holdwine"
3780,"2004-09-26",3.9,"The recently released 04 version of this seasonal brew has been kicked up to 8% abv.    An unfiltered copper appearance with an average size head offered up the fruity banana esters of a typical hefe, complimented by a malty, earthy aroma.  Nicely carbonated, with a smooth, medium-to-full bodied flavor with a long, slightly sweet, fruity finish.  A worthy alternative to the proliferation of octoberfests around this time of year.","Hanover, Maryland, USA","guzzler67"
3780,"2003-12-03",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2003 Pale and cloudy in appearance with a small head.  Aroma is sweet and mildly spiced. This beer is very smooth and creamy, reminding me strongly of a banana milkshake.  My only complaint would be that this beer was a bit too sweet for me, although I didn't have any trouble finishing my glass.  Overall, quite nice, but I think that next time I would have it with dessert rather than with my meal.","Westminster, Maryland, USA","Ladyhedgehog"
3780,"2003-11-29",4.1,"[On tap]  Cloudy amber color.  Strong clove and banana aroma, typical of the style.  Excellent flavor profile filled the whole tongue.  Perhaps a tad too sweet, but that's arguable.  An excellent brew!","Westminster, Maryland, USA","LordHedgehog"
3780,"2003-10-26",3.6,"Hazy light brown color with a very small head. Aroma of banana, and clove. Malty flavors accompanied by the banana and some spiciness. A decent offering.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","frylock"
3780,"2003-10-26",3.6,"Very hazy amber colour with a thin tan head. Potent aroma of bananas, cloves and yeast. Medium to Light-bodied; Strong malty flavour with the added aformentioned sweetness. Aftertaste shows a lot of spiceyness: cloves, coriander seed and nutmeg. Overall, a nice weizen bock from the Mid-Atlantic! I had this on draught at the Pizza Plant in Buffalo, New York.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
3780,"2003-10-18",3.9,"(Served via growler) Big banana and clove nose. The palate is nourishing with, a smooth mouth feel. The finish is full of malt and flavorful yeast. Tasty weizenbock.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
3780,"2003-01-03",3.6,"An excellent beer with exceptional hints of banana and clove.  There are many better Weizenbocks on the market, but the smooth, subtle hints that this beer gives make this more of a classic style of this beer.","Dallas, Texas, USA","dukefan"
3780,"2002-10-21",2.9,"Sampled at brewery. Color of muddy water - half a week or so of additional lagering would not have hurt, bad head retention.
Nice banana and clove with a good full body. Not quite up to par with the weizenbocks I have become used to here in Bavaria, but not bad either.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"
3780,"2002-10-02",3.8,"Sampled at the brewery--good head over hazy light brown body.  Fine, full mouthfeel with flavors of banana, clove and spice in huge quantities.  I dont perceive some of the bubblegum flavors Ive detected in previous years nor the piercing fruitiness Ive had in the past for this one.  Still, very nice.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
3780,"2002-01-30",3.8,"Nut brown and hazy. Acidic and fresh with nice butterscotch aroma. A great weizenbock!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
3780,"2001-03-20",4.3,"Nice nose, great grain taste, chill hazes and aromatic. Decent hop presence, and a pleasant aftertaste, a must try for Wheat beer lovers.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
