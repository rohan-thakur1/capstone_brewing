444,"2008-05-22",3.0,"Had on ice at dinner the other night. Clear pour with weak legs. Nose is boozey and rice like with hardly any other flavors. Mouth feel is dry and a bit grainy. I can tell that this is not a high quality sake but the taste is decent and gets the job done. Warming finish.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
444,"2004-06-21",2.6,"Glass at Tany 52 (NYC)...
Crystal clear, colorless beverage (much like water). The aroma is very vineous and alcoholic. Grainy flavor with a warm blast of alcohol (although the brew is served chilled). Balanced. Extra dry mouthfeel with no carbonation. I dont know if I will persue this sake rating thing. Sake is just so different that your average ""beer"".  Im having trouble seperating the apples from the oranges. Hmmm?","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
444,"2004-01-26",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2005 Bottle at Tatany 52 (NYC): Little detectable aroma with a slightly buttery taste (rich mouthfeel).  Evident dryness.  Very little alcohol burn.  Nice.  I really enjoyed this one!

Rerate: Had again at NYC restaurant called ""Plate"".  Decent.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
