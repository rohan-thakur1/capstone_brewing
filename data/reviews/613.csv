The aroma featured a cool sweet toffee and caramel maltiness, some roastiness but definitely is more of a sweet stout. The flavor had a mildly roasty chocolate malt base with some unique almost herbal accents, perhaps some subtle notes of red fruit, not exceptionally complex but just enough nuance to distinguish itself. The palate was slightly thinner than other oatmeal stouts, but still had the recognizable silky oatmeal texture. Finish was dark chocolate with a touch of sour cocoa bitterness.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel and chocolate; ends slightly bitter and dry with bread and roasted malts.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Manages to create a great chocolate-centered flavour that is really balanced. The dryness at the end soon takes over the start. Could have been more intense and complex, but is tasty nonetheless.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Very dark. Probably a 35-36. Light tan head dissipated quickly

Sweet roasty malts up front with bitterness balancing out the mid palate and finish. I get some hip bitterness but think most is from the coffee flavors from the roasting. 

Medium bodied, nicely carbonated 

Nice beer, well balanced.

Looks: Deep blackish brown colour; Two finger head with crumpety beige foam which lasted for 2 minutes. Excellent sticky lacing with no carbonation.

Aroma: Rich, fragrant and sweet roasted malt, with strong cream, roasted coffee beans, caramel, toffee, sugar, burnt toast, dark chocolate, strong raisins, very light lemon and light grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet strongly-roasted malt, with strong metallic, strong roasted coffee beans, toffee, light soy sauce, caramel, moderate cream, strong roasted nuts, red fruits notes, molasses, yeast, strong lemon, strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Medium body; Fairly thick and slightly creamy palate.

<i.Mouth Feel: Totally surprised by its superb roastyness  simple minded, but so damn strong and rich in coffee beans and toast and nutty taste its insanely likeable! And quite hard to believe its sweetness is really restrained, mostly thick molasses and with a touch of cherry like fruitness. The oatmeal gives out slight amount of thickness and bitterness. The metallic hard waterl well its pretty much offset by the roastyness so its bearable. Chocolate and toffee taste seems a little muted. Overall its still really nice!

Hoppiness: Light lemon and thin grass in nose, strong for both in taste. Bitterness from hops and oatmeal are high, pleasant enough for a lasting, strong astringent finish.

After taste: Quite dry. Very roasty, metallic and hoppy bitter to mouth.

Comments: I was expecting some strong smooth and rich oatmeal taste from this poster boy. Turns out its still pretty impressive, particularly the complex aroma and dominant roast coffee beans.

Overall: I poured this 550 mL bottle into a glass in which I like to drink beer. Too sweet to be a desert beer, unless you were eating a unsweetened chocolate cake. Would go really well with something salty. Not a beer I would drink often. RateBeer member Mep3222 summed it well, ""Not as sweet as some milk stouts, but has that smoothness. And this one is just very balanced and all around good."" #respectbeerbrethren","New Jersey, USA","gdubu493"

 Poured from bottle into pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a deep brown color with a big and thick tan colored head. The head has a nice level of retention, fading over ~ 5 min to give a decent level of lacing.

 Smell- The aroma is big of oats and chocolate. Mixed with these are some sweeter caramel and a light vanilla aroma. A light roasted malt and coffee aroma round out the remainder of the nose creating a sweet and roasty smell overall.

 Taste  The taste starts out with a smooth but dry oatmeal and roasty malt taste. A bitter chocolate flavor, that comes quickly after the initial taste, begins to get sweetened as the taste advances further. Flavors of caramel and some vanilla sweeten the brew quite a bit. The brew remains relatively sweet to the end where a light earthy hop joins the flavor. In the end a pleasant sweet oaty and lightly hopped chocolate flavor are left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the creamier side for an only 5 % abv with a carbonation level that is just below average. Very nice for the stout style and letting all those great dark and malty flavors to be truly sensed by the tongue.

 Overall  A delicious stout that isnt overwhelming with alcohol. It has a wonderful oat and chocolate flavor with just the right balance of sweet and hop.","","Darkmagus82"

613,"2014-04-14",4.1,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance was an exceptionally dark brown colored body that yields a foamy brown three finger head that lasted for most of the beer. A beautiful spider web lacing clung to the sides of the glass. The body was too dark for any carbonation to be seen rising.
The smell had some chocolate up front and very strong. Once it warmed a bit some caramels and nuts came out.
The taste brought back the chocolate but it seemed it was more combined with the other flavors of caramel, nuts and some light toffee as well.
On the palate, it sat at/about a heavy with a dry finish and left nothing harsh on my tongue. This is not a sessionable beer despite the low ABV.
Overall, I thought this was a very good beer and am glad it was as heavy as it was. This would make an exceptional dessert beer and also go well in my wifes special chocolate cupcakes that she makes with stouts.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

613,"2014-02-24",4.5,"Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout sits supreme, right at the top of the stout lineup. Its not flashy. It does not pull you in with a garish label, absurd name or with the promise that its brewed with rattlesnake meat or cobra adrenaline. Hell the label hasnt been changed since God knows when. It does what it is supposed to do, it tells you who made it and what style it is. In fact this beer is brewed in Yorkshire with well water from a well they sunk in 1758 and chances are by the looks of this label it could be the only one they have ever used and I respect that. The stout pours an inky sweet black with massive head that remains stoic through its entire life in the glass. Aroma is of oatmeal (obviously), coffee, malts and barley. The flavor of each sip is complex, silky and textured. Key players on the pallet are roasted malts, oatmeal and subtle coffee hints. Thankfully this beer has a WIDE availability. If you have trouble locating this beer you should reconsider your surroundings. I could enjoy this beer in any environment from winter to summer and everywhere in between. This beer did it right.

613,"2013-10-05",3.7,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear ruby black color with a finger or two of a pretty dark, tan head. Quite a bit of carbonation as well, which I wasnt really expecting.

Smell: A lot of roastiness, with a pretty significant caramel note. Theres some coffee, but Im not really getting any sorts of chocolate aromas. This beer has a very good nose on it.

Taste: For being supposedly the best oatmeal stout in the world, Im pretty largely let down for a few reasons. Ill assume this is due to my ignorance, but anyway... first of all, the mouthfeel isnt at all what I thought it would be. Rather than a smooth feel, its pretty light with a surprising amount of prickly carbonation. Second, the flavor is just lacking. It isnt bad, but it sort of tastes like watered down coffee. As it warms up a bit, I also get a minor dark fruit flavor that I find odd, but it does add a bit more depth and intrigue to the beer. Ive been under the impression that (of ones Ive had) oatmeal stouts have a relatively thick, creamy mouthfeel with fairly mild carbonation, and have a nice, bold flavor. I dont get it with this.

My dad claims that this is the best beer that hes ever had, but Ive had better oatmeal stouts that were made right here in Michigan. I know my opinion is an unpopular one, but it is what it is. S.S.O.S. is a drinkable, easy-to-session sort of beer, but its not how I like my stouts.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

A large, fluffy, dark caramel-colored head forms quickly and retains a little better than average. Once it dissipates, splotchy and spiderweb lacing is left on the edges of the glass, while a thin cap sits atop the beer. Aromas are comprised primarily of sweet chocolate and sorghum. While these aromas come through distinctly, they are not overly bold. There are also notes of roasted malt and ripe cherry. Mouthfeel is smooth, and not too viscous. The mild hop on the finish accentuates the light carbonation scrubbing. Flavors come through almost as distinctly as the aromas. However, everything is mild. In a time of craft brewers competing for the biggest beer, its nice to sip a stout that has a lot of flavor in different varieties without having my palate overwhelmed. Mild chocolate, sorghum, and ripe fruit esters occur, essentially in that order. I regard this a quintessential stout.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"

613,"2012-12-05",3.6,"Dark brown pour. Thick tan head. A lot of chocolate and dark roast in aroma. Taste has some of the chocolate and sweetness that comes with the oatmeal stout. A little bit if funkiness from open fermentation. Not quite as clean and hoppy as I'm use to from American styles but it was very good.

613,"2012-09-04",3.1,"A beautiful pour, dark and opaque brown/black with a nutty brown head thats reasonably thick and lasts a reasonable amount of time that leaves a nice lacing. Its my second favorite looking beer. 
I really couldnt get much of a scent from it. I dont think Im experienced enough to really catch the notes yet. A deep deep inhale I can smell something, faint, and its nice, but I cant place the spice or floral or what it is. Its like a richness thats right on the edge of perception. 
The taste is not as sweet as I would have expected, but this was my first oatmeal stout. Didnt know what to expect, but I like my Apple and Cinnimon Oatmeal breakfast, so I think I expected something sweet subconciously. *grin* 
Theres a sharp bitterness, almost a burnt taste. Like what I would expect burnt oats to taste like. But its only slightly annoying. More interesting, actually.

Pours an opaque, near black with a 2-finger brown head that recedes quickly.  The lacing is briefly pretty good, but slides back down after a couple seconds. 

Mild aroma of molasses, dark fruit, roast coffee and chocolate. 

Taste is a gentle blend of milk chocolate , brown sugar and roast coffee. 

Slightly above medium body with light carbonation.  

This bottle lacked the full flavor and body that the last one I drank had.  The beer was fresh, so maybe more age would have helped.  It wasn't bad, just not as good as I remembered.

613,"2012-04-09",4.1,"A: Pours an almost black body, but it isnt impenetrable to the light. The head is fantastic, its a light leather color that starts off at four fingers (due to my aggressive pour, and stays at one finger for quite a duration. Excellent (almost maddening) retention and lacing overall.

S: Bakers chocolate, roast, and a tiny bit of dark fruit and licorice. This is gonna be great...

T: Not quite as chocolatey as the nose would dictate. Theres more of a roasted malt flavor as the dominating note, with generous hints of chocolate, coffee, licorice, smoke, and perhaps a little raisin appearing on the palate at various points. Quite complex, and quite delicious!

M: Medium carbonation, and I have to say, a little thin textured. Not watery by any stretch, though. The oats give it an excellent creaminess - though perhaps not quite as silky as I would have liked, and the finish is just dry enough to satisfy immensely. The drinkability factor is disturbing...Im having to refrain from guzzling this down in one sip.

A - Poured a smooth, dark brown color with about 8 fingers of head but I usually pour pretty vigorously. Through the glass, I see nothing but there is some light coming through at the edges.

S - Im getting bread and oats for sure. Theres a syrup scent and maybe some earthiness. Very deep and rich but nothing that truly stands out.

T - Tastes like it smells. Oatmeal, bread, syrup, earthiness and very very relaxed stout taste of malts and crackers. 

M - 50/50 carbonation / liquid upon swish. Light bodied and very drinkable. Its beer but not in your face. The linger of malts is very pleasant.

A strong midnight black color, with an off-white/tan head of modest size. No lacing, but very nice head retention.

Brisk chocolate and molasses control the aroma, with a definite starchy undertone.

A strong sweet chocolate flavored malt up front, with more sublte dark fruit flavors alongside. The oats add a depth to the flavor. A smooth, coffee bitterness settles in after the malt and resides in the mouth until after the sip is gone. The flavor is strong, smooth, and complete in each dram. 

The iInitial feel is quite smooth, with a sharp crispness from the surprisingly confident carbonation.

This head subsides, but will stick around at quarter inch. Aromas of chocolate roast malt, brown sugar, molasses, light roast coffee, and milk.

Nice sweet stout but unlike Carribbean stouts, its nicely balanced and not cloying. Really lovely. Theres also powdered dark cocolate on the finish.

A: Pitch black with small amounts of carbonation bubbles coming up to the caramel colored thick foam head that clings to the side as it dissipates. It retains a nice tan lacing.

T: A nice slightly hoppy flavor with a sweet flavor up front with a nice roasted semi-dry finish. Chocolate notes are present, but very subtle. 

M: Medium to thick with a creamy mouth feel that goes down surprisingly easy. Very little carbonation here, but it works.

Initial thoughts on the taste is how sweet and smooth it is for a stout. Not bitter at all. Malt is everywhere but not overpowering. Sooo smooth.

Also has some dark fruit that became noticeable about halfway through. Medium bodied and sits well on the tongue. Drink it around 50-55 degrees to get the full experience, too cold and its complexity wont show itself, which is the story for most every stout or porter.

613,"2011-05-15",3.7,"Went back-to-back with Samuel Smiths Taddy Porter. Similar to the Old Brewery Pale Ale/India Ale, this is really almost dead-on with the Taddy Porter for flavor. Maybe a bit more punch on every level--thicker head, slightly more aroma, stronger flavors--but still a super-mild, drinkable stout. Nothing of the viscosity of so many stouts out there (especially American stouts). I really liked this because of its pairability: I had this with some pretty rich Ben & Jerrys ice cream (New York Super Fudge Chunk), and the pairing worked beautifully. The ice cream was so flavorful that a bigger stout probably would have been too much. Sipping the Smiths after each bite just brought out this really nice chocolate softness.","California, USA","cmc619"

613,"2011-01-23",4.0,"Review from notes, sampled 3/6/2008
03/06/2008
Ive always been afraid to buy any of the Samuel Smith products because of that clear bottle they come in. So today I stopped at the local and the oatmeal stout had just arrived and was still sealed in the case box. Theres no way that one is light struck, now is the time to try it!

Pours a solid dark brown with fluffy off white head that laces itself on the way down the glass. Aroma is faint chocolate and caramel. Taste follows the smell. Mouthfeel is medium thin, creamy, and drying. The chocolate taste lingers after each sip. Decent brew, definitely not like the American oatmeal stouts Ive had. This one is much more sessionable. I could drink a few of these.

Revisited on 12/13/2009
I ended up with a Sam Smith Gift pack at a holiday party Yankee swap so I thought Id do a better job reviewing this beer.
Beer pours a deep dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light. Large fluffy mocha head sticks around forever and laces the glass all the way down. Smells of molasses, oatmeal and a hint of chocolate. Taste is filled with caramel, molasses, chocolate, a bit of dark fruit. Finishes kind of dry with a lingering subtle roast bitterness. Mouthfeel is just short of creamy, medium body and carbonation. I actually think I like this a bit less than the first time I reviewed this. Its a decent enough beer, but nothing special. Maybe I just enjoy the less subtle American version of everything. My score reflects the first time I tried this.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

Dark ruby/red highlights visible only when held directly to the light.  Aroma was of roasted coffee malt that also smells of cream and dry oats.  A delicate sweetness comes forth from the cream.  Even uncovering a chocolate milk scent.  Outstanding.  Dry, roasted oats opening the taste.  The coffee is inconspicuous at first, but really shines as the beer crosses the palate toward the throat.  The silky smooth chocolate milk is more distinguished in the taste.  Wonderful.  Medium mouthfeel.  Dry with a pronounced warmth after the swallow.  Smooth and creamy.  Precise and appropriate.  An almost slippery or oily finish that I found very delectable.  Wow!!!  Thats about all I can say.  Truly an extraordinary Stout.  I really sdont see how Sam Smiths does it.

This beer was easier to drink than some stouts and has a enjoyable palate. but I found it more on the boring side.","Houston, Texas, USA","trevman7"

613,"2010-04-17",4.5,"This is my all-time favorite beer. It has no weakness other than the fact that its too rich and heavy to drink more than a pint or so. Hardly a problem, there are many other excellent porters, stouts, and blacks to drink, many from the marvelous Tadcaster brewery.","USA","ceegod"
613,"2010-04-15",4.6,"When I first heard that there was such a thing as an oatmeal stout I had a hard time comprehending it. I didnt know who would want to drink a beer that tasted like oatmeal or had an oatmeal-like texture. Well, oats are just another grain, much like barely, only sweeter. So making a beer brewed with oats is not all that unorthodox, actually. Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is a great example of how tasty and smooth a beer can be, even with the word oatmeal in the name.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAI was only able to find this import in 18.7oz bomber bottles, and due to the bottle shape, it poured very rough with constant glugs, but thankfully did not produce a gigantic head. The beer is opaque black in body with a light brown, foamy head which lingered throughout the life of the beer and left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was surprisingly mellow with a general malty, sweet scent.TASTEIm a fan of stouts because they tend to have a strong, roasty quality to their taste. But with Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout the taste was a bit in the opposite direction. The flavor here is remarkably sweet with a general malty palate. It certainly doesnt taste like your breakfast oatmeal, but it does have a very robust, yet mellow taste. Chocolate and vanilla seem to be underlying flavors, making this an excellent choice as a dessert beer. Whats interesting is the beer does not have a creamy texture as many stouts are know for. It has the basic mouthfeel of an ale with a great incorporation of hops so as to have a distinct bitterness. FINISHTheres no direct correlation between taste and finish, as some of the sweetest beers can be hard to drink. However, Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stouts gentle, sweet taste is made even better by the fact its so smooth. The brewery describes it as having a velvety texture and a bittersweet finish. I couldnt have said it any better myself.BODYA beer like this just goes to show the versatility of the stout style. Many people would just assume this is a heavy beer, either in terms of potency or sheer weight, but its surprisingly light. At only 5% ABV, Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is lightweight-friendly (especially considering its delectable taste). I wasnt able to find out the number of calories and carbs, but Id estimate their numbers are fairly average and comparable to a mass-market lager. This is NOT a beer that sticks to your ribs, and would work well as a session brew if it wasnt so rare and expensive.FINAL THOUGHTSI cannot fathom why Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is not as popular as, or even more well-known than Guinness. This beer is much tastier and easier to drink, and considering its relatively light body it could be enjoyed by anyone. Talk about not judging a book by its cover!NOTE: watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAaoCJPfXds","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

I tried this beer on November 18, 2009 after purchasing a Christmas pack of Samuel Smith ales from one of my local LCBO outlets.

Very dark brown body with a creamy caramel-coloured head and some nice lacing.

The aroma has got a good amount of roasted malts (but not over-roasted), with sweet chocolate and espresso beans notes. Some creamy oats, some floral notes. A touch of dark fruits (sultana raisins, prunes). Very intriguing.

Wow, the taste is extremely well-balanced and flavourful! Starts out with some serious roasted coffee bean notes and milk chocolate, followed by an exceptional creaminess from the oats. Then you get some bitterness and sourness. The after-taste is slightly roasted and bitter-sweet, with a tiny bit of burnt malts. This definitely beats the other oatmeal stouts Ive had!

Medium-bodied, with some moderate carbonation. Exceptionally smooth, even creamy. The alcohol is not present at all.

It goes down very smoothly and doesnt get boring not overwhelming. This is one of the best stouts out there, and nothing is really compromised in this beer. You get enough of everything.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","DenisLD"

A - Black with some mahogany hues on the edges. Large thick, creamy and foamy beige head. Good retention leaving a good lacing behind.

S - Dark and milk chocolate along with some espresso and coffee notes. Some roasted malts, oats, nuts, and other earthy flavors. Some sugar smell too, more sweet/less roasted than many other stouts.

T - Similar to the smell. A good amount of oat and grain taste, with a slight roasted taste. This goes along with an earthy taste. Good amount of chocolate and some coffee taste. Also a good amount of molasses/brown sugar. Slight herbal towards the finish. Ends with a definite oat taste, almost oat cookie like.

M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Very silky and smooth. A fair amount of chewiness, but not quite as much as I was expecting from an oatmeal stout.

D - Very good drinkability. Smooth and goes down easy but also has a full mouthfeel. The taste is nice and doesnt overpower. A bit of sweetness and bitterness. A good amount of oat taste.

613,"2009-12-27",3.8,"12 oz. bottle, the third from a four-pack. Roasted, tart, woody, fruity smell. Very much an ale in the aroma. Scents of rich chocolate, cotton candy, and brown sugar. Pours a clear dark brown with an amber hue and a large amount of thick, uneven, taupe head. Produces good lacing. Roasted cofee dominates the taste at first, but sweet fruit comes to take over. Tart, lemony flavor. An unfortunate but weak hint of metal is present. Carob, cantalope, and yellow plum elements. Dry, bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body. Soft and smooth in the palate, as an oatmeal ale should be. The palate would score more strongly if it were not lighter than ideal. Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout is an entertaining, likable, and thoroughly English brew.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Chocolate sweetness, with some roastiness and a finish that has just enough hops to avoid sickliness. I drank this with barely a chill on it and wished it were cooler. Half way down the bottle I fetched some Red Leicester to eat with it. That worked well, and I think the sweetness would have been too much for me without it.

613,"2009-12-21",3.4,"Bottled. This was I think the first good beer I ever bought after finding Ratebeer and deciding I was going to start rating. It was also the last beer I drank before I began rating. And it has been 5 years and 2600 ratings before I have revisited it.

I remember thinking it was incredibly sweet at the time, and the flavor was very different to me. I see that sweetness now, but it is way more mellow than I perceived, with most of the character being chiefly lactic. There is a little bit of roast and grain in there, with a slightly carbonic, oaty note. Im not sure how crazy I was about this at the time, and I know Im not crazy about it now, although to me it is still one of the only truly sweet ""sweet stouts"" Ive yet drank. Very few oatmeal stouts dare approach this level of sweetness that is not just a byproduct of underattenuation.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

613,"2009-08-16",4.0,"Pours out lighter than expected, a dark tawny with a decent viscosity. A quick rush of bubbles stretches the thick khaki head farther into the near black body. The head sits atop calm and frothy, lasting the whole glass, and leaving a bit of slippery lace. The aroma is very roasty, with a little bit of chocolate, an some toffee. The flavor is sweet and milk chocolaty at first, then seamlessly fades into a coffee rich dryness. The mouthfeel is a little on the light side, but is as smooth and glass and retains in the mouth very well. Top notch stout.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"
613,"2009-08-11",3.5,"Very handsome in the glass...a dark brown pour that settles into a deeper black with some ruby highlights. The head is long-lasting, dark tan in colour, and retains some very impressive lacing throughout the entire pint. I could detect very little smell at first, but as this warmed up, i could get some chocolate, coffee, and considerable nutmeg traces. This is a very malty, balanced beer whose taste centers mostly on cereal-like flavours and is rounded out by some subtle coffee and roasted barley. The finish is semi-sweet, contains hints of cacao, and has a nice dry feeling.","JAPAN","buzzoven"

Begins with malt sweetness - molasses, caramel and chocolate, chewy toffee - and continues into a balancing hop spice bitterness, though subtle.

613,"2009-06-02",4.4,"Can I change the sampled ammount to around a million? I love this beer. Not quite totally black since there is some light penetration that shows an intensly dark cherry hue. Produces decent sized brown head that is fun to watch while it bubbles down. Retains enough cap to cover entire beer for about half the pint and make some solid lacing rings early on only. None of the qualities of this beer are harsh, strong or overwhelming - everything is in perfect balance and leans towards the milder side which is the main reason that it is so easy and enjoyable to drink. Aroma has sweet warm roasted malts and a good blend of coffee first and chocolate second. Defenetly more coffee - but both of those aromas are quite mild which is nice for once. Taste is very well rounded with the obvious roasted malts and coffee flavours that are excellent. Perfect mouthfeel. Incredibaly smooth and thick with the perfect ammount of slight dry tart bitterness. I dream of this beer in a never emptying pint...always slightly warm and always fresh. My favorite stout.

My dad would purchase a few of these every now and then to share, and as a result, I began to develop a liking of dark beers as a teenager. It pours opaque brown/black with a marvelous tan head. Aroma of sweet roasted malts with hints of caramel, chocolate and fruits. The flavor is outstanding. Initially its sweet roasted malts, later followed by the taste of dark fruit, chocolate, coffee and hint of dry hop bitterness. Full of flavor that does not overwhelm. Extremely smooth and creamy and incredibly easy to drink. While this is not the absolute best beer that Ive had, it is simply a classic and one of finest examples of the style.

The aroma was nothing fancy, and honestly even the first taste wasnt particularly overwhelming.  But after the 2nd, 3rd, 4th tastes you will fall in love with this beer.  Perhaps slightly too carbonated, this beer fills the mouth with roasted character.  It then leaves a delightfully warming aftertaste of oats leaving you to long for a second pour.",", Pennsylvania, USA","suchen"
613,"2009-02-08",4.5,"Poured from 550ml bottle into large dimpled mug.
Aroma - Dark roasted malt, dark chocolate,and coffee.
Appearance - Opaque black with creamy two finger tan head. Head dissipates rather quickly leaving nice lacing that fully coats the glass.
Flavor - Tastes pretty much like it smells. Some dark fruit that I didnt pick up in the aroma. Bittersweet aftertaste; but thats not a bad thing.
Palate - Not slick like some oatmeal stouts. More of a dry stout with the edge taken off. Carbonation comes through just enough to make it a bit lively on the tongue.

613,"2008-10-24",3.7,"550mL bottle from my mixed gift pack. Pours what is, by stout standards, a ’light’ colour. Smells very faint of stoutness, I guess. What strikes me the most about this stout is just how sweet it is, I can’t believe it’s not listed as a sweet stout. There’s absolutely NO bitterness. Good thing I like sweeter stouts. Very velvety smooth. Caramel is apparent, mild milk chocolate, coffee, with the most subtle hint of roasted malts, but no detectable bitterness. Almost dry in the aftertaste, but not really.

The beer finishes with a flavor of burnt oats and malts, which lingers in the mouth and throat.  There is also something else in there... nuts perhaps?

This is a pretty heavy beer, even though the mouthfeel is fairly smooth.  It leaves a thick, burnt oat and dark cocoa flavor in your mouth which is quite tasty and not at all obtrusive.  Very rich, strong, smooth, and filling.","San Diego, California, USA","kflorence"

Practically black, thin head. Bizarrely, theres the aroma of mouldy cheese. However, theres also sweet dark fruits and coffee. The taste starts quite coffee-like, but as you let it sit in the mouth that builds up. And as you swallow, when the vapours rise up into the nose, it gets even stronger. Soft mouthfeel, good full body.  The taste has burnt raisins too. Rich and smooth, and very tasty.

It had a lovely and full beige head, and the beer was like a dark root-beer hue.  It would be something that I would eat perhaps with a LITE dinner or lunch with a beef dip sansfries or salad with it. The drink packs a punch though, it is very smooth, not a lot of bubbles - which I love, and the texture is quite unique - soft would be the word, but does not describe the character - body of this brew was heavy - almost like it could be a meal in and of itself, and after that only one I was feeling a very nice buzz coming on me .I would undubitably have it again, even with a bag of peanut butter pretzels. I think the peanut taste, salt and the heavy beer would be pleasing to the palate.

Some nice malted aromas with some caramel and sweet tones too for your nose. Makes the first sip anticipation mouth-watering. 

Very smooth and rich as it goes down-all of the aromas are pleasant in the mouth along with a bit of toffee/coffee. I dont get too much body initially as I taste it, but it is full when you are able to take it all in. The finish is nice and smooth too and leaves a great taste in your mouth that isnt too strong-makes you want to drink again.

I thought it was a bit thin for the flavors it was carrying. Solid stuff though. 7-4-8-3-15

Initial impression is roasted malt sweetness, mild chocolate-coffee effect which is smoothed by the oatmeal. The hops are there but integrated so they are not a seperate taste. A very nice, rich stout that could easily substitute for a meal. Highly recommended.","Salem, Oregon, USA","spikester"

Caramel, coffee, chocolate, with dark fruit elements in the background like dates and raisins. In the mouth it starts slightly sweet, with a light mouthfeel and smooth soft carbonation. The flavor is rich with caramel and roasty elements. Towards the middle it turns milder, as the carbonation kicks up chocolate and fruit associations.

A fine stout.","Mount Vernon, Iowa, USA","GJF"

The color has a dark brown/black tinge, but for a stout it was somewhat opaque;light could be seen through the beer.  the taste is sweet, full bodied, roasty and malty.  The mouthfeel is on the thick side.  The palate is a tad bitter, probably from the bitersweet chocolate.  This gives the beer a nice balance.  Definitely enjoyable.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"

18.6 oz bottle: 1/4/09: Pretty much exactly the same as my last rating. Guess this beer is a mess. Disappointing. I wonder if it has always been this way, and I just dont remember it properly from my earlier days or if they changed the recipe to make it appeal more to the masses like Guinness, aka replacing roastiness with muddled muddiness-literally taste of mud.

Mellow malt flavor with very low bitteness. As the beer warmed and opened up, there is an incredible intense smoky flavor that dominates. Almost overpowering to the palate, but quite interesting.

613,"2007-11-03",4.6,"Oh man, oh man. This is in my top 3, and the other two are also Samuel Smiths (Nut Brown Ale and Imperial Stout). I dont know what these guys do thats different from basically everybody else, but it seems to extend to most of their beers that Ive tried. I dont see heads like this on anything else. Not foamy, not Guinnessy. Rich. Textured. Mature. Classic. Lovely. You can actually taste the oatmeal in this and I love oatmeal. Its got a silky smooth sweetness with just a little tang to offset it. I drank this for years before discovering their Imperial Stout. I was surprised and a little sad that I actuallly liked that better. But I alternate between them these days and love them both. Man, I want to pour this all over my face and down the back of my shirt. I bet it would be good for the skin.

Not too sure, seems strange in this beer, though not unpleasant.  A bit of roast.  A creamy full mouthfeel, but largely because of carbonation levels, not the liquid itself.  Not a bad thing, still a good palate.  Small bubbles make this drinkable.  Sweet malt, a little chocolate.  Some definite diacetyl.  Some fruit apple sort of tartness?

The retention and lacing are tenacious.  The aroma is of warm cookies, soft, sweet herbs and roasted malt.  Its very soft and even.  A soft, heavy texture slides down the throat.  Despite the rich, sweet flavor of this, the tounge is left a bit dry.  The first flavor is sugar and caramel.  Then comes an herbal element that is somewhere between fennel and tarragon; perhaps licorice.  The lengthy and marked aftertaste is of chocolate malt.  Yes, there is a reason this is an old favorite.  They sure can make stouts in England.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

The taste is somewhat of a reverse of this. The sugary flavors, caramel and brown sugar, seem to dilute a little and provide a nice accent to roasted malts with chocolate notes as the latter two become the centerpiece of the taste. This reminded me an awful lot of hazelnut coffee with a little caramel, some sugar, and a lot of half and half, but those are just my own musings. Both the taste and mouthfeel are very creamy.

Pretty dry flavours, decent roastiness but once again that typical metallic/hard-water Samuel Smith taste. Well balanced, yet tame. A pleasant, long finish. Medium mouthfeel, not as substantial & chewy as I hoped, yet good carbonation levels. Decent brew, seems a bit stale & lifeless though (just like Samuel Smiths other offerings - it might be the pasteurization/filtering/artificial carbonation).

TECHNICAL: Poured a dark brown to black. Aroma was light caramel, chocolate and coffee along with some toffee and maybe some licorice and cola. The flavor is the same as the aroma.

The flavour is terrific!  Sour and sweet, making way to rich chocolate and sugar notes, roasted malt, a definite oat presence, and some excellent bitter hops that arent instantly noticeable but definitely there on the tail end.

613,"2006-10-04",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2006 Bottle. Its always difficult when rating a highly regarded beer to separate the product from the reputation. However, Samuel Smith almost always lives up to its name. This beer pours a dark brown hue with a very thin tan head. The beer actually looks darker in the glass than it does during the pour. Head disappears quickly. Delightful aroma dominated by oatmeal and alcohol, with a slight hint of chocolate. Taste is consumed by oatmeal, and is extremely sugary. However, there is a nice under laying roasted bitterness, especially in the finish (which also has hints of coffee). While this beer mostly tastes like oatmeal, it is well balanced with a nice silky texture (which seems to be a trademark of the Samuel Smith brews I have tried). Ive never tried an oatmeal based beer (stout, porter, or otherwise) where oatmeal has dominated the taste to such a degree. And you know what? I really like it.","USA","Bajahobo"

613,"2006-09-23",4.3,"This is the first beer I have reviewed on RateBeer. That said, it has quickly become one of my favorite, and has given me the kick in the butt to start reviewing!

Upon first pouring, this beer did not have any particularly strong smell. Dark character and a light head. If you really want to stick your nose in it, the smell is almost creamy.

As others have mentioned, this stout has a smooth, milky flavor to it. An almost (but not overpoweringly) sweet taste increased drinkability and evened the drink out nicely. The mouthfeel was not incredibly noteworthy, though I would categorize it as thicker than average if necessary.

Im still working on the identification of tastes and smells, but when it gets down to it, the bottom line is a great drink. It is going to the top among my favorites. I would buy it again if I had the chance; in fact, though I typically try something new each visit, I am making an exception for this drink, and am planning on picking up an extra one for the reserve.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Pyronite"

The beer has a nice dark garnet transparent body with a tall frothy tan head.  Nice lacing.  The flavor is nicely sweet, chocolate oatmeal brownies, has some nice spicyness in the hops and raw quality sugars too.  Perhaps a light fennel seed.  The palate is initally slick and watery, but it seems like a light airy mousse and has a nice licorice lingering taste.  Quite refreshing.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

Smells of brown sugar and molasses blended into a dry smoky oat.

The flavor begins with a touch of brown sugar with a sweet red grape that then fades into a slightly sour and woody smoky flavor that seems to be based on a thick oat.

The mouth feel is light with a plentiful, small bubbled carbonation that accentuates the slight sourness of the flavor.

This ones really fantastic. The flavor is very simple and delicate, and the mouth feel works exceptionally well with it. Very nice.","South Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","DTB"

Kind of surprised that the description up front is about its being pasteurized and CO2-conditioned, but perhaps that’s how it could travel so well.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Pours a deep black with a reasonably-sized light brown head.
Here is another beer that is almost too familiar to rate. The aroma? ""Well, it smells like Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout!"" (I guess that is some combination of molassas, chocolate, oak, and a hint of alcohol/wine, though I keep smelling Sam Smiths and have a hard time thinking beyond that.)
The flavor is sweet, chocolately, before turning to a lovely and gentle lactic sourness followed by a subtle and smooth bitter roasted cocoa bean finish. The mouthfeel is superb, especially at 5%, creamy, substantial, delicous, luxuriously smooth and amply carbonated at the same time.

To me, this is the benchmark sweet stout. There may be others out there that are better, but this is the familiar and thoroughly excellent reference point to which I compare them.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Needless to say it was quite an oatmealicious evening. The pour produced an ordinary dark beige head cascading into a deep black body reminiscent of every other stout I have had. Nothing bad about that, as I generally enjoy the mysterious yet comforting aura that they reveal - more so than say pale lagers which are also commonplace. The aroma was of straightforward coffee and dark chocolate, with notes of Irish creme, soap and a certain alcohol tinge. Not complex but still a pleasant nose. The flavor shared a similar composition with a notable glue-like component that I found hard to get past but edulcorates over time.

Initial aroma struck me as a prune & caramel ice cream sundae! Rum & soy emerge later. A musty background suggests oxidation, but I find it rather fitting here. Bitter coffee flits about in the flavor, but the experience is mostly sweet malts with chocolate & dark fruits. Soy sauce shows late, adding a ""meaty"" character. Mouthfeel is sticky-smooth and the finish is a little bit dirty. Given its availability in my area, this would make a fine ""everyday"" stout.

613,"2005-12-11",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2014 Re-rate from the pint+ bottle, this was the first really outstanding (4+) beer I had, from back in the day.  Aroma is thick and meaty, heavy chocolate with coffee and toffee, strong maltiness.  Ruby pitch pour with a rocky, creamy brown head.  Powerful taste, roasted malt is much stronger here, with all the mentioned aroma notes, and a strong, classy dryness.  Well-hopped and slightly vinous in feel.  Could use additional body.  Sourness evident after about a half-pint.  Really yummy. [Revision 2006.08.25: 4.0]I remember this being one of my first true gateway beers, but I never could seem to find it fresh.  This ones from a gift set and, judging by the India Ale from the same set, very fresh.  1 PT 2.7 OZ, foil-capped.  Nose is inky with light blackberry, very sweet with light cream under the strong fruit.  Pitch pour but still with a hint of mahogany-red peeking out from the bottom, a large and dense rocky tan head.  Taste very sweet with lightly tart fruity undercurrent, overall fruit still strong, some nice clean burnt and roast notes, but no coffee or char domination.  Lightly silky-creamy but not as much as other beers Ive had.  The sugary character isnt enough to cloy, but it does take a big toll in the mouthfeel, which the oats arent able to improve significantly.  Medium body is still slightly creamy, not too airy.

613,"2005-12-07",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 Literature about London life through its many generations is in no short supply.  Prolific masters of the pen like George Bernard Shaw, Hillare Belloc, G.K. Chesterton and others have guaranteed that London, as a symbol of civilization, will remain in our imaginations well into the future.  Amongst these writings and polemics we find quaint stories and epic tales, and through many of them we begin to see patterns, and trends that get to the very heart of old London life.  Take, for example, the chimney sweeps aloofness, a ladys pointed wit or the brusqueness of the Indian colonel.  They seem to act by a universal code.  An English gentleman is as sure to tip his hat as gravity is to bring it to the ground should he bow before taking it off.  My favorite among them all is the one that concerns the portly and gruff looking old man, who lassitudinously clomps around pubs looking sour.  I argue he clomps around seeking good company, is gruff because hes seen whats in the London shadows and is portly because he appreciates the gourmands grasp on lifes finer bits.  We will call him Samuel Smith; Oatmeal Stout by trade.  Clad in an unassuming cloak of vintage labeling, the ineluctable SSOM practically glowers from the bottle, but really eases up when it comes to the task at hand: that is, drinking.  The cavernous, dark demeanor is no different from the Cro magnon brow our imagined blue collar Englishman has.  This deep shadow may cover the expressiveness of the beer in an unnecessary obscurity, but behind it is a convivial and curious brew.  Speaking of curious, the Oatmeal Stouts smell, which we will not extend to the analogy of the Englishman because that would be weird, is a strange collection of chocolate, coffee, dust and wet stone.  Also, it smelled a bit like perfume which we will DEFINITELY NOT extend to the imaginary Brit.  The taste is also dark and brooding, but a closer inspection tells a different tale.  Here we have a delicious flavor base of chocolate liqueur, supported by an overarching sweetness and oatmeal graininess.  After the chocolate dwindles were left with an oozing, trickling coffee taste, sloping down to a settled stomach and a great wide smile.  And lo, thats really what the Englishman was.  Behind the wild whiskers and the oft wild eyes was a hardy soul looking for a little beverage satiety.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Okay, here goes...first sip...didnt detect much of a flavor...oh, wait, there it is.  I can taste the oatmeal.  It is...not bad, but not great either.  A step up from Guiness, although there are many other better stouts out there.  Not sure where the high ratings come from.  I think my favorite stouts are the imperials, these oatmeal sweet stouts need a little more...just a little more punch.  The description states, silky texture, I can see that.

Molasses aroma with dark chocolate notes. Very nice aroma. Dark, reddish brown, almost opaque body. Large, tan, tight bubble head. Nice lace and lasting head. At 1st sip I thought it was much milder than I expected. Perhaps this is due to the Ratebeer big beer bias. I figured a brew rated over a 4 had to be big. In fact, without looking, I am guessing this is the highest rated 5% or less ABV beer on the site. This is a nice stout; creamy with some dry dark chocolate and some lactose.

A delicious, creamy, sweet stout and one of my favourite beers.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"

613,"2005-07-18",4.5,"This is one of my favorite beers of all-time.  I often joke that its kind of a cross between a beer and a milkshake.  It is very creamy and even a little sweet -- like an oatmeal chocolate cookie.

However, this is the first Sam Smiths I have had in GA that hasn;t been skunked all to hell.  Got it at Bankhead Beverage on the way back from Carrollton this weekend, with a mismarked pricetag.  But onto the beer.  Deep chocolate and oatmeal, grainy aroma.  Lots of malt and hops mixed with a very sweet buttercream and oatmeal flavor.  Yumm.  Dry on the finish.  But all in all definitely a fine oatmeal stout.","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"

It was very smooth and creamy and had a molassas flavor in the end... the oats were evident on the back of the palatte but nor overwhelming...  A very drinkable beer and still maintained its robust chocolate flavor in the last gulp.  Found myself wanting more... The initial taste was odd as the narrow neck prevented me from getting a good portion into my mouth.  Great taste.","Maryland, USA","9er"
613,"2005-07-16",3.7,"Pours a darker black with a good layer of tan head. Nose is lots of chocolate and some coffee roastiness notes. Taste is lots of chocolate with some molasses sweetness as well. People complain that it is not thick enough, but most stouts arent much thicker. I think lots of people get too used to drinking imperials, that they forget how simple and flavorful a simple stout can and should be. Good silky mouthfeel. Yum yum.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"

613,"2005-06-22",4.1,"Tasted this gem after downing a Samuel Smiths Taddy Porter. Aroma was fine but my palate could have done with a break in between tastings. By the end of the pint though this showed to be another winner for Mr. Smith. 
The first Oatmeal Stout I have tasted so I can only go off of some of the insipid Oatmeal stouts I have attempted to brew myself. Poured from the 55cL bottle into a tall stem glass, a dense tan head formed, a good half inch, atop a ruby-red, almost black body. Head remained in its place for the length and laced rings down the glass. Quite a dry gritty and grainy aroma, lightly spicy with a lot of roasted malt and molasses coming through. Rich and complex malt in the mouth, chocolate, molasses, yeast, burnt grain and a noticeable breakfast-style hit of oatmeal crossed the tongue and became quite bitter in the back, before finishing with a smooth, roasted malt swallow.Similar to the Porter, it was unbelievably smooth and well rounded in the mouth, dry and malty, and very well balanced. Flavours levelled out well around room temperature and remained silky smooth and well blended until the end. Another absolute gem from this brewery. Lovely!!!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Appears black in the glass save light brown around the edges. Not much head, brown and it does leave lace as the beer recedes.

Smell is hard to place bitter and acidic. Could this be the oatmeal? Light sweet nutty smell as well.

Taste is creamy and smooth juxtaposed bitter flavors. Brew is malty with a burnt-nut taste. Doesnt bite like alot of stouts. This brew is smooth but still complex. I would call it medium bodied despite the bold appearance. Very drinkable.

To its credit, it does taste flavorful, with a bit of molasses mixed in with light chocolate and sweet residual sugar.  But there is no yeast presence, no thick, chewy, interesting body.

Tastes a lot like Youngs chocolate stout when gulped, but even better when drank slowly.  The  beautiful thing about this is I can drink it as slowly as a higher alcohol beer, due to the immense flavor, and drink more because the alcohol level is so low.

Jan, 2005: Unpleasant metallic whiff from the co2.  When gas has burned off there are savlon notes, a touch of roasted malts and a hint of fruit. Savlon again in the flavour along with boiled veg. Boiled brown sugar sweetness merging with a stewed bitterness. Stewed and boiled notes throughout. The artificial carbonation gives a silky unnatural mouthfeel. But let the beer settle for a bit and the mouthfeel is more pleasantly neutral.  When carbonated and cold the fruit makes itself felt, with chocolate notes in the finish.

There seems to be some hops trying to break out from the malt, they give it a flowery/fruity taste. This is a very complex beer with several things going on at once. I just tasted the Bells Kalamazoo Stout before this and I can say they are two very different beers. They are both classified as ""sweet stouts"" but this easily fits that category while the Bells didnt.  The commercial description is dead on with the finish, I would say that it is ""bittersweet."" I gotta tell you, these last two beers have really opened my mind as to what a good stout can taste like. I am so used to having American Tap Guiness and these beers are so much more.

613,"2004-10-30",4.1,"A mixture of every color except black.  The aroma is deep yet mild.  A subtle perfume of chocolate, vanilla, pit fruit, milk, wet leaves and currants.

Like ever Samuel Smith beer that Ive had, the nose is sour & sweet, a bit like a cheap sweet red wine.  Not great.  Taste is sweet - too sweet - with a smoky slightly bitter finish but no real good smack to the buds, more like a sweeter porter.  A little boring.  The body is a little lighter than I expected for an oatmeal stout, and it has very low carbonation.  Im a bit surprised with the accolades on this one.  Too sweet for an oatmeal stout I think.","Sligo","pjk33"

Wow--this is beautiful beer! Pours incredibly deep black with a perfect abundant carmel brown head of fine bubbles that lace picturesquely down the sides of the glass. Buttery toffee aromas, with a hint of fruity esters. A pleasant yeastiness that is very much in the fam for Samual Smiths brews. The head has a velvety, creamy feel on the lips like a latte made with whole milk.

The aroma features chocolate and dark malt, but overall it possesses a clean scrubbed quality that isnt really soapy or detergent laden, but more along the lines of cleanly scrubbed porcelain. There are hints of the cane sugar and for all I know they may be what is creating that freshly cleaned aroma. The body is a light dampening black that seems to cast a general shadow on whatever space it occupies. The head starts out large and fluffy. It is fully two fingers thick and a healthy mocha color to start, but fades in relatively short order to a compressed dime thin affair. For is sweet and brown sugar/molasses accented which is obviously from cane sugar. The middle is smooth, sweet and malty while the finish has a hotness that borders on spicy. The far aftertaste brings an unwelcome metallic tinge that adds both an off flavor and a mild tingling tartness that is akin to sticking a 9 volt battery on your tongue. Needless to say its not a positive element to the flavor composition.  <P>

Deep malt profile full of chocolate, licorice, brown sugar sweetness and something powdery alike flour. There's no mistake on the tongue, this is a sweet stout, with caramelic peaks, tons of oatmeal, some powder sugar perhaps and nevertheless a great balance due to subdued english hops. Silky medium body, highly quaffable, definitely the most obvious definition of the style I've faced.

While having a good, lasting head, this beer lacked the body, complexity and 'nourishing' character that one expects of an oatmeal stout. It was thin and a bit tart. Not very good and not worth the $4.50 retail price. This beer pales in comparison to Young's oatmeal stout. Was it skunked? Perhaps.

The oatmeal only coming in to play much later as my palate settled. Nice mouthfeel, found it medium bodied and only slightly robust with hints of oak and mesquite. It's a beauty to look at, mouthfeel is great, but I feel a little over-hyped. This could be that I find the Imperials to be a little more satisfying, which might hinder review a tinge. It's a good outing, some history and a bit of a cult following and for the most part a solid Oatmeal Stout and minus the hype, you might agree this is a 4 out of 5 star beer.

Sweat smell. Excellent full body taste, that’s very demanding of the palate. The head disappears quickly, and you can actually listen and hear the head fizzle and snap as it evaporates. Is this beer is trying to tell us something? I’m a different kind of beer rater, as well as tasting and smelling, I listen to what my beer has to say.

I have had this beer again since my last rating, and I believe that the batch I drank before were skunky.  This time, it was way better.

Smells dark and sweet, as if ""dark"" was a flavor. Brown sugar comes to mind, with a little bit of fruit and coffee.

Tastes suprisingly fruity. Coffee is the main flavor. There's something else there and I think it's from the oatmeal, but it's quite good and complex.

The head is creamy tan with good lacing and retention. The aroma is sweet coffee, oats, and roasted malt. I wish it were stronger. The taste is something I didnt think I liked at first. Sure, it is rich. Sure, it is creamy. But, there is an overwhelming burnt taste that quickly changes from what is that? to I need more!

The beer it self is a deep dark mahogany brown..with some ruby highlights...nice.
the smell is malty and fresh..can maybe sense some oats.
This beer has a great chewy long lasting tatse for one so low in alcohol..good job.. i taste some malt, some choclate ( milk chocolate for a change) some coffee undertones and a creamy taste right at the end..very well done.

Taste really smacks of nice sweet oat character the whole way through, almost too much, its sweetness is chewy and strong. Roasted malts play secondary on the palatte along with some darl fruityness of plum and very light bitter chocolate notes which alll mostly come through near the finish.

Vague burnt malt/grain, licorice, sweet...and smelly socks. Taste is more cereal - indeed like oatmeal flakes. Chocolate returns in the background/palate, like slightly sweetened fondant. Chocolatey character, bitter-sweet, gains more emphasis in the finish, like a lesser chocolate with much non-cocoa additions.

While its relatively thin body and ""safe"" flavor may leave the advanced connoisseur a bit wanting, I am still satisfied by this creamy brew.  Pours dark brown with a nice, dense tan head (much like Mackeson XXX).  Aroma is roasted, sweet, and a bit chocolatey.  Flavor is succulent, smooth, creamy, and surprisingly sweet, consisting of toasted malts, malt sugars, and a note of chocolate.  In my opinion a better brew than their Imperial Stout.

This is a real English stout, by which I mean that aroma and flavor components include all the traits one would expect from a good English ale - fruity, bready yeast, toffee notes, and a clean herbal hop bite. This, of course, in addition to the smooth stout palate, the hints of burnt toast, and the deep color and creamy head. It almost tastes like a blended beer, with both ale and stout in the mix.

You can taste the oatmeal in the beer and the sweetness it leaves you with is just perfect.  I don't generally like sweet stouts, however this one is unavoidably likable.

However, it somehow manages to taste much much better than any dry, bitter wine.  There's a small note of sweetness and grain flavor to offset the winelike flavor.  Unrelentingly bitter/sour aftertaste.  Very good.","USA","orangelazarus"

Medium to thick consistancy. Bitter aftertaste.","Savannah, Missouri, USA","dev"
613,"2003-01-28",3.6,"Almost no carbonation but the head lasts until you finish the bottle. A very balanced oatmeal stout. Balanced in every possible way. There is a hint of oxidation in the back ground (a little cardboard on the finish-in my bottle at least) that can be detected but the effect is overpowered by the hopbitterness as you drink.  It is a perfect amalgalm of roasted malts, hop bitterness and malty sweetness.  HOWEVER, this is not the best oatmeal stout I've sampled, not even close.  Try St-Ambroise Oatmeal stout (McCauslan) if you want richness, roastiness, chocolate and a healthy dose of bitterness (balanced on a much higher scale).  A superbly pleasant brew nonetheless. As the beer warms up, alchohol and fruit notes are more apparent and the roastyness in the nose is more noticeable.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"

Aroma is of roastiness, dough, gingerbread, malt, chocolate and dark fruit. The pour is black as night...with a thinly creamy dark tannish head gracing its presence on my glass and coating it with a thin reminder of lacing to remember this glorious event. The taste is magnificent....a beautiful blend of roasts with a mild fruity and ever so slightly bitter finish. The carbonation is practically non-apparent here, and i dont feel as if im chewing my drink down..sometimes a definite plus. The aftertaste is definitely smokey with chocolate and plum residue apparent and a heavy helping of malty dryness.

613,"2002-12-31",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2003 Poured out of bottle, bought at Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago, 12/10/02.  Deep, dark dark brown beer with a slight, murky brown cream head.  The head forms in what I can only describe as small glops along the surface and on the edges of the glass, and it quickly gives off a wonderful malty cocoa (almost nutty) aroma.  A very nice flavor of cocoa and malt, this one is a very easy drink for a stout, but does not lose any of the richness of flavor to make it so.  It's just very tasty and feels wonderful going down.  The finish is perhaps a little too bitter (like with some dark chocolates), but that mostly just makes me want to take another gulp to get rid of it!

Beautiful appearence; deep ruby color with a frothy,lacy head.  Not highly effervescent.
Very complex, and mostly appealing aroma: Roasted malted grains (perhaps this is the 'oatmeal'), hops, caramel, chocolate.  But, I also smelled URINE!  I did buy it from Safeway, and it does have a clear bottle, but I didn't think 'skunky' meant 'pissy'.  Hmmm.  I dock a couple ""aroma"" points.
I found the flavor pleasant, very well balanced, but not particularly complex.

613,"2002-11-14",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2004 As I initially couldn't buy the Imperial Stout, I'm left rating the Oatmeal Stout, which isn't a bad thing at all.  Although I was expecting more flaring oatmeal overtones, this has to be one of the best beers I've ever had as far as sit down drinkability. Upon first examination, this beer has the consistency of worcestershire sauce, not nearly as thick as other stouts.  Pleasant aroma, mildly sweet, minimal carbonation, bearing a creamy roasted flavor.  Awesome texture and finish.  This is going to become one of my standards.  Bring on the St. Ambroise so I can rate it next!  RE-RATE:  After pairing two of the Victorian pints to a St. Ambroise, I am prepared to say that this is the smoothest stout I've had to date.

613,"2002-10-13",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2012 My favorite beer, which has been now for about 9 years I guess. Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout. She doesnt come cheap though, at around $5.00 (for a 18.7 ounce Victorian Pint), only the most privileged and discerning people will choose the luxury of her presence, but she is well worth it my friends. She is dark, rich and beautiful, with a creamy mocha head and complex yet well balanced personality. Her medium-full body is exceptionally smooth, silky and well-rounded, carrying the delightful scent of dark malt, chocolate and toasted oats. Her subdued flavors will please any palate, and will leave you wishing for more to drown out the slightly bittersweet aftertaste once she is gone. As an extra bonus - she is also certified Vegan.

613,"2002-10-13",4.3,"Re-Rate 10/13/02: The beer pours a full bodied black color, the generous head is chocolate brown, the lace lays in sheets upon the Chimay Goblet I drink it from, as I think goblets and chalices do more for stouts than the traditional Guinness tulip glasses. When you bring this to your lips for the first taste, the roasted malt, oats, caramel, and an almost molasses like tone greets you. Front is malt sweet; the middle is full, rich, creamy and somewhat chocolate like, the finish is where you find the Kent hops at the semi-sweet dry finish, and a long lasting toasted grain after taste. Stouts are not meant for everyone, as much as I love them, many will find them bitter, overpowering and totally lacking in merit, but then I feel that way about most Lagers/Pilsners, but to me this is what makes beer and beer drinkers so interesting, the difference in taste and opinions.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

613,"2002-09-13",4.2,"They need to lose the clear bottle. Mine started with a lot of vinegar in the nose and taste, but improved a bit as it warmed. I was expecting something spectacular, but, quite frankly, this particular bottle wasnt any better than Youngs Oatmeal Stout in the nitro cans, so Im rating accordingly. Hopefully Ill be able to get a fresher bottle soon.
Ive had good luck with SSs other (clear bottle) products, so this was a surprise. RE-RATE: St. Patties Day 2002. Gave this one another shot, in light of the praise it receives here. Still full of vinegar, not creamy, and not particularly impressive. I went with the smaller bottle this time, hoping that something was wrong with the (large) bottle I tried before. I just dont get what everyone sees in this one. (6/15/02) Still trying to like this one. First sip is soy sauce, but after that Im getting some chocolate. Better than before, but not a religious experience. Out of respect to the consensus, Ill add a few points. Closing the book on this beer, it has not been kind to me, but perhaps Ill revisit it in a year or two. 7/13/02: Another bottle, another rerate. I left this one in the fridge entirely too long, but nonetheless it has been a better experience than the previous bottles. Smooth chocolate and coffee with none of the off flavors described in my previous ratings. At last, a good fresh bottle!","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"

Dark, perfectly black stout color.  Tan head that didnt last long.  The beer is a lot more hearty and thick in appearance than in the taste and mouthfeel, which I found surprisingly thin and watery.  I was hoping for chocolate or candied taste like what I got in the Smith imperial stout, though I mainly got a light roasty, burnt, woody taste.  A pleasant flavor overall.  Finishes really smooth but uneventful.  Aroma reminded me slightly of sniffing a red wine, though also like the aroma of Anchor Porter.  Gets a little more robust in taste as it warms.  With more of a chocolatey bite to it, I might not tell the difference between this and the Anchor Porter.

Immediate strong nose of oat and cereal.  Some roast, meat malt as well.  Tastes of roasted nuts, malts, oat.  Some mild bitterness.  Looses flavor as it sits and has a buttery, slippery type of mouthfeel that was unpleasant.  Too short of a finish.  Some good bitterness.

The flavor is a combination of mocha, malt, butter, mild chocolate, wine, and sweetness.  The bitterness comes to the fore as you swallow.  A delicious concoction -- this beer is one of the reasons Samuel Smith has such a great reputation.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
613,"2002-04-30",3.9,"Rich, heady, Italian coffee aroma and a strong, smoky flavor.  The flavor is remiscent of smoked meat, but its not at all unpleasant.  I dont tend to like beers that have smoky flavors, but this one is so smooth and rich, rather than jarring, that I enjoy it quite a lot.  Its balanced by a gentle sweetness, and it has a slightly malty finish.  A pretty complex and interesting beer.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"

Near black color with a moderate, but lasting head of tan bubbles, lots of lace coat the glass. Dark fruit, prunes, lavender and mild pinot noir aroma. Silky and smooth in feel, perhaps a touch thin in the finish. Quite dry and with come dark berries and charcoal. A great brew, just not a top 50 anymore.

The huge rocky head is the color of brown sugar, is mostly lasting, and has good lacing.  The  nose is roasted cereal, grain, and caramel balanced with herbs, resin, grass and earth.  The flavor is heavy but balanced between bitter and sweet with roasted grains and coffee predominating.  The finish is long and has a metallic feel.

This beer however, when found fresh, the other reviews say it all.  Silky mouthfeel that numbs the tongue, yet very crisp.  What a concept!  Addictive buttery aroma of oats and molasses.  A very unique bitter finish.  Winey, oaty, bubblegum and a sheer joy to drink.  Never has a beer eluded all other styles in its class as does this.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

I guess thats different to everyone, but to me, its just very flavorful and hearty, with a good head. Its what I always dreamed of before I had it. Its what I had in mind when I first had Guinness and was dissappointed. All of the Samuel Smiths brews Ive tried are really high quality, but this one is my favorite tasting one. Of course these brews are also expensive, so if you just are looking for a buzz, and have a limited pocketbook, youll need to go for something cheaper.","Illinois, USA","soulrefugee"

613,"2001-08-24",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2003 2001:  Truly wonderful stout that is just bursting with sweet, winey, chocolatey flavors, a beautiful body and robust head.  A nose that is just a bit too faint and a slightly too strong bitterness running through the palate keep this from joining Mackeson and Youngs in my pantheon, but for those who like their oats more robust and less sweet and smooth, this could be the one.

2003:  Some classics don't ever fade, even after a couple of years of rating like crazy.  Changing the points around a little; can't call it perfect in appearance with the tiny little head it has, but on the other hand I do feel the aroma to be stronger and more complex than before.

I cant drink as much of it (the sweeter taste becomes a bit sickening after more than a pint or two) but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  It has more of a robust, roasted dark chocolate/caramel flavor than other stouts (I could be confusing the oatmeal taste for caramel, but I didnt taste oatmeal). Only in the aftertaste did I detect a slightly bitter sensation, and not that of coffee.  Very thick and heavy, I was surprised when I held it up to the light that it wasnt quite opaque.

Shakespeare Stout.  Nice and heavy, full flavor.
Somewhat sweet but not overbearing.
2015 rate: Nearly opaque, pours with a full head that fades fast. Nose is clean with chocolate, mild roast, light nuttiness. Medium palate but a strong carbonic bite leads to a roasty mildly acrid finish that shows alcohol, oily texture. A little sweetness manages to come up, with chocolate and hazelnuts, but mostly its pretty dry. Too carbonic and dry despite having a nice constructions of choc/roast/nut elements.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
