3818,"2015-05-31",4.2,"Saison du Fermier batch 2

Has an orange-yellow color with a decent, white head. 

Has aromas of crisp lemon peel, wet grass, soft hay and shreded unripe blood orange. This gets coated up by a mellow, slightly funky sourness, which leaves enough space on the palate for the fruits to unfold. The nose gets balanced by mellow, old dusty wood, exhibiting a well functioning melange.

Has a medium to lower carbonation, with a round mouthfeel to it, resulting in a dry, sour finish.

Tastes of earthy, wooden malts, together with leather and dough straw among flowery grass. Sour lemon peel is recognizable from the beginning until the very end, blending perfectly into the beers acidic, slightly funky tartness, resulting in a wooden, fruity dryness. Durings its finish, the beer offers an incredibly soft, minerals infused mouthfeel, together with juicy lemon and a fitting lactic acid. 

Ranges between an irresistable fruiti- and funkiness, creating a wonderful, complex taste. Both taste directions offer a decent range of well integrated flavors, which blend outstandingly soft together during the finish. In contrast to many other american sours, this features a very pleasant, not over the top sourness, which creates a wonderful interaction with the beers subtle, mellow fruitiness.","GERMANY","aleigator"
3818,"2015-05-27",4.4,"Poured from a Batch #3 bottle. 
Aroma is really nice with some light grain notes, medium citrus, medium light tropical and stone fruit and a light peppery note. Reminds me a lot of Saison Bernice but with some light oak. 
Pours a slightly hazy, yellow gold with a large, pillowy white head. Head exhibits nice retention as it slowly recedes into itself. Moderate lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is lightly to moderately tart with a nice lemon, citrus note. Light grain notes with medium bitterness. Light woodsy, peppery phenolic note. Medium light tropical and stone fruit with a light mineral quality. Light oak notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium light bodied with nice carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this is stupidly good and very similar to Bernice. It might be a slight bit tarter with a bit more lemon and less stone and tropical fruit. The oak adds some complexity, but also a bit of tannins.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
