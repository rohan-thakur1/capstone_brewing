972,"2017-04-12",4.0,"Super hazy, bronzed and copper glow to a two centimetre tall tan head along with a bunch of bubbles rising from the centre of the bottom of the glass. Aroma of rich dry yeast, a lot of bread, some grass, herbs, bananas, flowers and a good dose of light but astringent hops. Medium-bodied; Assertive funky brett flavours with a lot of yeast, some herbs and grass and a very dry oaky and cedar-y flavour with a distinctly dry finish. Aftertaste is nice and floral with the grass, flowers, yeast, oak and dry finishes by far the strongest flavours with some hop bitterness around at all, but there is absolutely no room for sweet, malty or hoppy notes here, this is all about the funky yeast, the dry grain and malt bill and especially the aging in barrels here. Overall, a good beer, especially if its the type of beer you are looking for here. This isnt a great example of this style, since these are typically cookie-cutter-ish, from Belgium, but this is an American-Last Frontier styled nouveaux Belgie, which goes well. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Columbus Circle), New York on 27-November-2015 for US$11,99 sampled at home in Washington just a few hours after shopping in the same store for more rare-ish beers at WFCC on 11-April-2017.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

Poured into my tulip glass. Color is a bright golden with a nice white head and some good ringy lacing. The nose brings wood, grass, citrus, lemon, hay, funk, and some light grain. The taste is quite nice as well. I really enjoy this. A slight fruit presence comes along with citrus and the nice grassy character. A bit of barnyard funk. Really nicely done with a good feel. A bit much in the end and Ive liked some of their other Belgians better, but this is quite good.

972,"2010-03-17",4.2,"Bottle thanks to hannont!Particularly rich gold, slightly opaque with a creamy yellow-beige head that laces everywhere. Nose is very reminiscent of 1+ year Temptation, not quite the wood complexity but the chardonnay and brett is nearly spot, light lemon mixing with faint white sweetness. The brett is a mite farther along than desired at this point. The flavor unfortunately loses some of the chardonnay, leaving a near-strictly belgian ale beer with a stronger farm bite and a more apparent hop note, the combination of which is noticeably un-seemless. The carbonation is not quite as soft as Temptation, lightly stinging yet still rather dry. Overall this is a great beer, easily drinkable and yet complex.

972,"2009-05-09",3.9,"650 ml bottle at Toncatcher’s house, shared with Padrefan, Fordest and a few others. Cloudy yellow pour with lots of floaties, thin white head. Nose of brett, oak and sour grapes. Taste is overtly sour with grapes, sweet apricot, persimmons and some wood. The finish is long and dry. The mouthfeel is full and malty. Overall: A very nice complex sour beer.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
972,"2009-03-01",3.8,"Bomber.  An absolutely massive, billowing head of thick, spongy foam lasts for eons, slowly creeping of the edge of the glass, letting you know right off the bat something really funky is going on here.  Eventually, solid sheets of ultra-sticky foam are left behind to slowly break apart into tattered ribbons.  The underlying body is golden in hue and very lightly hazy, with intense streams of micro-bubble effervescense screeching towards the surface.  The nose is funky as can be, very bretty and old-oaky, with alot of toasted wood and vanilla character.  Light golden fruits lend little sweetness, while lemony citrus esters and staunch floral hops serve up the counterpoint.  The flavor isnt quite as funked out.  The brett presence subsides just a little, leaving funky toasted oak notes, dusty floral hops, pepper and citrus rind.  The farmhouse character is very Orval-like, though not quite as magical.  Medium-plus on the palate and semi-dry, the carbonation is lively but fine, and not nearly as prickly as I thought it might be.  Overall, this is a damn fine representation of a bretty Belgian pale.  Good stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
972,"2009-02-12",3.9,"Interesting nose of oak and funk. Opaque orange golden pour with a nice bubbly head. Nice spicy sweetness initially followed by a barage of funky bretty notes and a light lemon note. Lingering dryness from the oak.  Big carbonated bite, maybe too much for me.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
972,"2009-01-08",4.0,"Bottled.  Awesome beer!  Nose is just wonderful...pleasant oak, brett, grassy.  Picked up a nice citrus (lime) along with all the dry, biscuity, brettiness that makes this small pale just a great beer.  Gets a load of character from the wine barrel too, which I liked.  I wish I had more of this around for when I wasnt in my typical, big brew mood.","San Francisco, California, USA","jarspag"
972,"2008-12-23",3.8,"22oz bottle. Pineapple brett with a hint of wood tannin initially on the nose. The yeast esters present themselves as dried fruit skin. Peaches and apricots. Quite dry and grassy. Very floral and aromatic hops with a decent pale malt base. A very pleasant and inviting aroma. Pours Dark, cloudy orange with a thick white head leaving drippy lacing down the sides of my glass. Flavor is crisp and quite refreshing. Dry, pale malt. Snappy, grassy and slightly spicy hops. Just the smallest hint of tannic wood on the back end. Really reminiscent of a Jolly Pumpkin brew. A good amount of brett throughout, but far from overpowering. Medium to full bodied for the style. Lively and mouth coating carbonation. Insanely drinkable. I would drink the hell out of this if it was available locally to me. Thanks Tim!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
972,"2008-10-16",3.8,"Pride is #6 on my list of the 7 Deadly Sins brews, courtesy of NoonanDBarbarian.  Poured into a tulip.

Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a massive bubbly white head that shows great retention and sheets of lacing.  Streams of carbonation come up from the bottom to feed the head throughout.  It certainly looks tasty.

The aroma has lots of fruity sweetness with apricots and apples on top of a hint of Belgian yeast and some spicy notes.  There is a noticeable funk in the nose as well, but certainly nothing overpowering.

The taste starts with just a touch of hop kick before giving way to the Belgian yeast and light fruits.  The funk is much more subtle in the taste and is only slightly detectable in the finish.

The mouthfeel is light to medium and very, very smooth for a Belgian pale.  Probably a little thin for the style but makes it very easy to drink.

Due to the fairly low ABV, the drinkability is high on this one.  It’s a good brew, but one that is probably on the lighter side of things as Belgian style ales go.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

972,"2008-06-30",4.1,"Golden honey in color. Healthy dollop of meringuelike foam adorns the glass with abundant lace. Extravagant and uplifting nose of white pepper, lime sherbet, honeydew melon, flowery hops, unripe peaches, Band-Aid and faint vanillin. Delightfully perfumey with a mild scent of crackery malt. Expansive carbonation condenses into a fine cream as it graces the palate. Initially briskly dry with a palate-scrubbing snap of peppy white pepper and plasticlike phenols. Band-Aid accentuates the already beautifully snappiness as succulent floral underpinnings enhance the lustrous esters and soften the body. Remarkably bright and quaffable with a well-rounded twinge of tartness. Pils malt is simplistic and artfully restrained, yet multidimensional and soundly structured at the same time as it reveals suggestive notes of crackers and fresh hay. Some caramelized-nut richness also develops as the beer reaches room temperature. Juicy yet subtle hoppiness fuses with the estery tropical fruitiness which is gently offset by the well-defined vanillin- and coconut-tinged oakiness. Dazzling interplay between the dryness and succulence as the beer is immaculately attenuated. Tight minerals, Band-Aid phenols and whispers of oak offset the slick fruitiness as they gently grip the palate. Finishes vibrantly flowery with grassy-hop accents amid a lingering fusion of crisp malt and creamy yeast. Lots of finesse and subtlety are on display here. Hats off to the brewers at Midnight Sun for yet another fine Belgian-style ale.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Its very pretty looking, cannot see through the beer, its a bit of a muted gold, not shiny, color. Its a very nice nuanced beer.  Aroma is at first herbal, which I first though as ""blah"" but as I stayed with the beer other interesting aspects came out.  I got a light brett, in the way of light dry pineapple. It worked nicely with the herbal yeasty character.  Taste is again herbal but not as strong.  It left a dry and lightly sweet aftertaste. It reminded me a bit of some Orval bottles I have come across.

972,"2008-02-12",4.1,"Pours hazy gold, with an inch-plus head of white fluff.
Lacework aplenty as the brew sips down.
Aromatics are all about the brett. 
Cloves, dusty boards, dried pineapple, lemon oil, juniper berries, wet hay, and bitter greens.
The mouthfeel is light, super-dry and crisp. Very refreshing.
The pallet has a light malt base, with tropical citrus notes, bitter fruit pith, and a mild funkiness.
Hopping is heavy handed in the bitterness, moderate in the middle, and the grassy overtones hint at some dry-hopping as well.
Finishes bone-dry and firmly bitter, with lingering phenolics.

The French oak aging really doesnt add any oaky tones, but Im sure it helped dry out the beer along with the Brett.

972,"2007-12-30",3.7,"Sunny blonde pour; silky white cream with a lasting thickness.  Cool cucumber vinaigrette, dill and clove in a very dry and lightly pungent aroma; minerals, banana, dark biscuits, a hint of lime zest.  Not especially bold with tangy funk quite yet, but pleasantly spiced and showing a sophisticated brisk character.  Flavor is tepid and underdeveloped, like something designed to highlight the strange nuances of brett but that has been disturbed too quickly.  Lovely mineral and tart citrus flavors lean uneasily into a sharp metallic glint that softens slowly but never quite concedes; the chardonnay barrel lends a soft buttery warmth of coconut, toasty oak and vanilla.  Hollows out with iron and aluminum toward the end; strongly effervescent, very soft and medium bodied in the mouth, finishing with a taste of fluffy white dough and an empty drying sensation longing for the forceful, rich pulse of brett.  Regretfully, this bottle should have aged quite a bit longer, but the impression it leaves, even while quite young and rough edged, is definitely still pleasant.
