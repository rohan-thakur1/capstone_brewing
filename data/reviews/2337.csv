Lots of dark fruits and a strong Belgian yeast. Its a little cardboardy, but not too shabby. The flavor is much of the same. Dark fruits, heavy malts, and a light sweetness. Not too bad. The mouth feel is a little heavy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and fruity yeast finish.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

2337,"2015-07-12",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2015 I was just looking up my review of this beer only to find I hadnt entered it yet. No idea how long ago it was when I has this, but thankfully I took detailed notes (which follow): 375 ml bottle from APEX. The last of the widely-distributed ""ations"" for me. 
 
Appearance: Pours with minimal head, the tiniest hint of a few bubbles but otherwise still. Beautiful deep, dark, ruby brown, clear. 4.5
 
Aroma: Beautiful raisins, plums simmering in brown sugar. Vanilla, port. Smells like a rich, decadent, boozy plum pie-like dessert. From the aroma, this is one I would definitely love to sip slowly like a fortified dessert wine. 9
 
Taste: Not nearly as sweet as the nose would suggest. Plenty sweet, sure, with loads of lush dark fruits. Id say raisin, but raisins remind me of a fruit thats over the hill, whereas this is in its prime. Somewhat dry finish. 8.5
 
Palate: Full body, slick, oily texture. Very soft carbonation -- not quite flat, but close. Still awfully fucking nice, though. 3
 
Overall: RR never disappoints. Never. Like Hemmingway. I sat in a lecture once with my Professor, in which he demonstrated that the boy in the Old Man and the Sea is an adult in his mid twenties, which both changes nothing and everything about the way it reads. Russian River creations are like that. The complexity lies hidden beneath the seeming simplicity. A beer you can enjoy without thinking about, but which rewards you for thinking about it. I expect I could return to this after decades of beer nerd-dom and still marvel how how they do what they do. [8.5/4.5/9/3/16=4.1]
 
Revisited 7/22/15, and dont find the magic I did last time. Wouldnt be inspired to spout Hemmingway at any rate. Body is a bit thin, flavors one-dimensional. Maybe it hurts that I was just typing up my Westy 12 review, but whatever it is Id call this a 3.8 at best this time around. Adjusting down slightly.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

The smell had a tender sweet spice rolling over top of a light dark fruity blend of sweet caramel malts. Dosed with a nice apple aroma, subtly everything combines nicely. 
The taste was moderately sweet and spicy leading to a nice underscore of bitterness strolling about. Theres no aftertaste but did have a nice sticky Belgian spice finish.

Aroma is balanced between light malt notes, moderate fruit esters and some medium light phenolics. Sweet raisin, toffee and treacle with fig, plum, carmelized sugar, clove and faint pepper. 
Pours brown to dark brown with some faint ruby highlights. Very big moderately thick tan head that slowly but steadily recedes until its about a quarter inch thick then it recedes very slowly. Moderately high lacing. 
Flavor is a bit more malt forward with some dark caramel, toffee, chocolate and light roast. Some raisin, cherry and plum esters in moderate amounts. Medium to medium light bitterness. Light clove note with some coriander as well. Some sweetness mid palate but the finish dries out a bit in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. Low astringency and medium high alcohol heat. Belgian yeast tends to feel hot to me. 
Overall a fairly good beer, but definitely not the best from Russian River. It feel a bit too carbonated for me and the finish lacks some depth. Good ester complexity, but the rest seems a bit one dimensional.

2337,"2012-08-31",3.4,"Meh. Nothing bad, though nothing overly good. Typical for style. Dark, dried fruit, caramelized sugar, belgium yeast, ripened banana and spice. I think the texture is the biggest downfall of this beer. I believe it is unbalanced, thin, alcoholic, and a tad too bitter, with a weak impression. The carbonation is good, very fine and velvety. Although overall, I was underwhelmed with the simple reproduction if this style. It's decent, though nothing groundbreaking.

The beer is chestnut / mahogany in color, with a full figured head that leaves a healthy amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of yeast, malt, dark fruits, spices. The flavor is well balanced and pleasant. This doesnt quite measure up to the great, authentic versions of the style, but is quite enjoyable nonetheless. The feel is really smooth on the palate, with alcohol content well hidden. Overall, another solid effort from one of Americas finest breweries.

Yeasty, bready, earthy, dried fruit malt aroma redolant of dried figs, vanilla bean, cocoa nibs and fresh baked bran muffins. First sip yields a silky toasted malt flavor reminiscent of currants, pecans and toasted oats. Right away you know this is a special brew. One that should be savored, like a fine sherry or rare cognac. A second sip reveals more complex notes of dark brown sugar, cardamom and exotic fruits. The finish is subtle with toasty malt and herbal hops. Make no mistake, this is world class Belgian style character coming from the West Coast.  A must for those who appreciate world-class ales.

Rough, weedy hopping and berry fruit flavours poke in amongst a mix of roasted and toasted rich malt, cocoa, dark candi, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, tamarind paste and Shiraz-esque tartness.

2337,"2011-12-06",3.6,"I received a 375ml caged and corked bottle from a friend in California. I poured it into a Trappist chalice.

Appearance: Extremely dark opaque maroon/purple hue. Forms a large, khaki, thick soapy head which retains quite well.

Smell: Strong Belgian notes of yeast, fruit, and some alcohol.

Taste: Belgian strong dark ales tend to be great beers, or at the very least very good beers. But Russian River Salvation is probably would I would consider the least best of the style Ive ever had and yet its still a pretty decent beer. Its just surprising how simple and bitter the palate is for the style. 

Beers of this style tend to be very fruity, malty and sweet, but Salvation is something else entirely. Its dry and bitter from beginning to end, which a significantly sharp bitterness with an astringency on the finish. While most beers of the style tend to taste like a fruit basket, this is a much more earthy, rustic palate of tobacco, leather and dry spice not unlike black pepper or even peppercorn. Theres a very general dark fruit taste, but I wouldnt call the palate fruity per se, nor can I pick out an individual flavors. Usually, beers of this sort have palates of the opposite variety with fruit first and earthiness second. Thats not to say this is a bad beer, just a little surprising considering the style.

Mouthfeel: Extremely lively with fizzy creaminess due to the Belgian yeast. Dry, bitter, smoky aftertaste that takes some getting used to.

Drinkability: One reason Im not the worlds biggest fan of Belgian beers is because of their low drinkability and Russian River Salvation plays that role perfectly. With an extremely effervescent body I find myself burping mid-swig! The 9% ABV body seems about right, though, as there is a lot of energy here. Fortunately its been brewed well enough to make use of that alcohol so theres only a mild warmth and alcohol presence throughout.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2337,"2011-11-16",3.5,"Batch 10 bottle from somewhere that I cant figure at the moment.  Thanks go to the person who hooked this one up for me.  Clear, rich ruby and chocolate color to this beer.  Huge off-white head that was somewhat surprising to see due to the smaller pop sound when the bottle was opened.  Sweet toffee in the aroma with some lighter spice character.  Maybe some clove and nutmeg.  Slightly sweet with toffee, toasted bread, and a slight spice character.  Slight bitterness in the finish with a touch of warming burn after.  To be honest, I dont feel the alcohol is masked much.  Not completely bad, though, on this colder Minnesota evening.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"

2337,"2011-06-25",4.2,"Batch 10.  Waited a long time for this one - I have had Salvation from Avery and the collaboration beer which blends the two.  The pour is a deep crimson color with a massive, khaki, fluffy head which settles to a creamy, rocky, layer and leaves lace all over.  The nose is full of baking spices (allspice, clove, nutmeg) and banana esters, some fig, light sassafras, faint anise, some Belgian chocolate, maybe pecan.  The flavor is very similar with more emphasis on malt richness and balancing notes; fig, date, faint anise and sassafras, significant Belgian chocolate, still some clove and allspice with banana underneath, and all balanced by a moderately light bitterness from light earth, slight roast, almost woodsy.  The palate is nearly lively, full, round, and silky mouthfeel; the carbonation is a bit high for the body.  The finish is long and balanced with allspice, pecan, woodsy bitterness, and some sassafras remaining.  About what I expected from having the collaboration beer and from what I have come to expect from RR.  Very well crafted BSDA with complexity, uniqueness, balance, and deceptive alcohol.  A very well finessed beer with just enough body and yeast character to make for a great Belgian but never too bold or overdone.  The bitterness really surprised me but fell into place nicely after the malt richness and yeast/malt complexity.  RR can do no wrong as far as I am concerned.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Although obviously a Belgian Strong Ale, this is lighter in both aroma and flavor than many in the style. It is well balanced.

The dark, translucent, ruby red body is capped by a small, foamy, beige colored head.  Spotty lacing marks the glass.  The aroma shows notes of burnt caramel, stewed raisons, figs, and a dry, dusty yeast.  Hints of earthy yeast and caramelized banana lend depth, while vinous notes add a dry, slightly sour depth that really sets this brew apart.  Flavors follow suit, with the sweet, caramelly, dark fruit base balanced by the dry, funky yeast and lightly tart, vinous notes.

Very fruity and spicy with banana and dark plum skins up front, then the alcohol seems to take over towards the finish.  This almost seems like its a little over attenuated, leaving it feel a touch thin in the body and very airy for such a high ABV beer.  When the fizzy spritzy carbonation combines with the high attenuation it makes it feel even lighter and more airy.  A good bit of both alcohol flavor and warmth on the finish.

Amazing burgundy with a rocky off-white head. Sweet in the mouth - cherries, prunes, plums, raisins, sugary, and slightly cloying. Freaking superb. Now for my rant. Last night was my first experience with the super hyped Russian River. I love me some good Belgian beer, so Ive been quite eager to give Vinnies work a shot. I was not disappointed. Heres what I like about all their beers I tried - theyre authentic. If I were to taste any of them blind, there would be no way you could convince me it was brewed in the states. So often we see these American ""takes"" on Belgian styles - some are delicious, many fall short. But very rarely do we see true, authentic Belgian style ales being brewed in America. It breaks my heart, to be perfectly honest. But to know that places like Russian River, Jolly Pumpkin, and Ommegang exist... well, It helps me sleep at night.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","santos999"

Flavor lends itself mostly toward fruit and general darkness, raisins, apple and pear being most prevalent.  Thick chocolate mousse in the middle that has a rough metallic glint     .

Pours a clear dark ruby brown with a tan head. Massive lacing. Nose is slightly sweet with a touch of yeast influence. Also heavy amounts of caramel as well. Flavor is tart and tangy. There is a pungent sweet flavor mixed with a slight citric/fruity one. Caramel tones very present. On the end you get an almost bitter edge which seems odd to me off this style. Feel is decent. Not a ton of carbonation and bubble over your tongue, but it is thick with character from ingredients. It is drinkable, yes. In a blind taste test, I doubt anyone would be able to tell that this one came from the U.S. (and not Belgium). However, I feel as if it lacks a level of maturity and oomph that would ever send me back to drinking it again. In the back of my mind, I do wonder if it needed some more age on it.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

Pours a mostly translucent deep brown with a large, dense head. Perfect for a belgian. Aroma exhudes dark, plummy fruits, raisins and figs from my duvel tulip, south asian spices and gentle florals. And booze. Plum and ginger taste, this beer would go really well with some good chinese dim sum. Really reminds me of hoisin sauce, perhaps (though not so salty), or a bite into a plum cake. There is a lot going on here, though the heat from the alcohol kind of gets in the way. Though Im not sure how well this would benefit from aging, Id be very curious to see how it tasted in 5+ years. The flavors are already very well meshed, but if the heat and carbonation subsided and oxidation grew more sherry notes, this could be extremely interesting.

Dark caramel lead the way with a lightly citrus presence (orange) and dark fruits, more raisins and prunes as the beer warmed. The alcohol in the flavor added complexity without being overdone.

Thanks to CharlesDarwin for bringing this to a tasting that he came to while in town a few weeks ago.  I was suprised at how bad this beer was compared to my expectations.  While it was above average, my expectations were pretty high based on the previous beers Ive been able to sample.  Having said that, it is still well made and very enjoyable.  I just would not turn it down but at the same time I am unlikely to place an order with the brewery for more.
Aroma / Appearance - A creamy clear lacing coats the sides of the glass from the pour until the time it is empty.  The head is a disappointing thin offwhite mess that tapers away to almost nothing.  Fortunately the body isnt bad - a tempting caramelly color that filters out much of the light.  The nose is typical Russian River with a hint of brett alongside vanilla and a nutty backbone.  Otherwise it was a little thinner than I was expecting.
Flavor / Palate - The oaky vanilla opening paves the way for a pleasureable experience which is a union of Sour patch kid residue and cocoa powder.  Watermelon and cookie dough come towards the middle of the glass.  The finish is dry, nutty and a little bretty.  While still solid this does not have the wow factor of some of the other releases.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2337,"2007-01-31",3.9,"My first Russian River beer.  I have to admit that before this beer I was virgin to the excellent brews produced by Russian River.  Unfortunately their beer is just not available in Ohio.  However, I managed to get some of their beers (including the Salvation) through a trade with, uh, crap!  I forgot who it was.  I think it was somebody in NC with the name of Ralph?  Roger?  Russ?  Wait, thats it - Russ!  Thanks Russ!  Ive been waiting to get my hands on a bottle - any bottle - of Russian River beer for quite some time!  Thanks!

My friend Rob and I got together on 1/30/2007 for a ""Salvation"" tasting that included Avery Salvation, Russian River Salvation, and Avery (/Russian River) Collaboration Not Litigation.  We really wanted to try all three of these beers together so that we could compare.  Needless to say, this was a really nice tasting that really helped redeem us from the sins of drinking bad beer during the less fortunate times in the past.  The Russian River Salavation followed the Avery Salavation in the tasting line-up...

Russian River Salvation pours a murky dull dark brown color with a large, dense, creamy tan head (good retention too).  The aroma is mildly sweet and contains malt, caramel corn, and some dark fruit as well.  The flavor also has a rich maltiness, some darker fruit/spice combination that I really cant put my finger on, and some sneaky caramel/chocolate characteristic.  The alcohol is extremely hidden unless this beer gets warmer than intedended.  In that case, the finish seems to be a bit more dry and some additional alcohol is detectable.  However, this is such a great beer that the alcohol adds to the overall flavor and experience with its gentle warming presence.  I would say that this beer has nearly a full body and is also soft and smooth on the palate.  Overall I think this was my favorite of the three beers we tasted (Avery Salvation, RR Salvation, Avery[/RR] Collaboration...).  Russian River Salvation is an excellent dark Belgian Stong Ale that will be hard to beat!  Even though this beer and the Avery one have the same name and alcohol content, they are two distinct and different beers in all other ways!

2337,"2007-01-21",3.8,"Clear but deep in color, Salvation pours with a nearly purple hue and a beautiful fluffy cream that laces in thick rings. Its aroma is very obviously vinous, with the depth of Cabernet and the light sourness of Champagne. Apple cider vinegar appears prominently alongside oak, vanilla and custard, while hints of cinnamon, anise, fig, caramel and Gouda provide ample complexity. The nose is quite light for such a dark looking beer, but decidedly unique. With such a graceful invitation, the flavor is rather shocking, melding dry coffee, smoke and Roquefort. Raisins and Champagne don a subtle sourness to which perfumy herbal connotations are added reminiscent of lavender and rosemary. Texturally, the fine carbonation and smooth mouthfeel fit the vinous character, while a finishing dryness promotes the coffee and oak flavors of the aftertaste. An intriguing effort that seems to close the gap between wine and beer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

2337,"2007-01-06",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Belgian Strong Ale says almost nothing about what a beer is really like.  It excludes the possibility of torrid hops or malts, mostly, and makes a verbal non-written pact with the drinker about some fruits that may or may not be present, but thats sort of it.  Even so, the tag Belgian Strong Ale has connotations common to most beers that fall in the category.  Except Russian Rivers Salvation.  Its a different animal altogether.  Its attire would have me think its a beer, its bouquet would have me think its a fairground, and its taste would have me think its a faint yet sweet white wine.  Whatever the correct answer may be, this has indeed brought sweet mercy to genre of drink that desperately needs to break free of enforced identities and assumed appellations.  A very light but voluminous, pillow-like head creeps up the glass, colored with just a hint of pink and orange like a cloud over the horizon late in the day.  As it recedes it leaves behind a rice paper thin but tough and durable lacing that keeps the glass well insulated all the way to the last drop.  The beer is red like a ripe raspberry with a hint of cloudiness to keep it from being an entertaining lens for the tipsy drinker.  The smell is most forward with its alcohol, but quickly atones for its abrupt callousness with a slew of delicate and sweet fragrances.  Sparkling cider, Fuji apple, cranberry juice, the strange smell of cosmetics (sort of waxy), Welchs grape juice, vanilla and cotton candy all tantalize the nose in a parade of smells that are relatively rare in the world of beer.  In the mouth Salvation is a little less reliable, taking on a very light and ethereal personality.  Its mostly dry tinged with sugar like a dry white wine, but tickles the tongue like a sparkling wine.  Also accompanying this queer wine construction is a yeastiness that clearly belongs to beer fermentation, producing a hybrid flavor concept that combines both wine and beer.  Salvation is so light that its hard to tell whether its good or bad, but I didnt mind it.  Once the taste is firmly set in your mouth for analysis it quickly performs its soliloquy and leaves as quick as it came, vanishing and taking the entire flavor with it.  No aftertaste wanders about here.  The act of consumption is a signed contract, and once it has your Hancock it makes a quick escape.  Taste is fleeting, so enjoy it while you can.  Another strange phenomenon: the first sip is fairly substantial, but each gulp after that becomes more and more watery.  Its a cumulative effect, and by the end of the glass youll swear youre chugging bottled water.  The only consolation is that a very welcome guest at brunches world wide, the cantaloupe, takes on an increasingly more important role as the beer is consumed.  Maybe thats the Salvation?","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2337,"2006-11-05",3.2,"Well, I was digging through my cellar to find something that was good enough to be rated for #1600.  I didnt want to drink something so good that people I normally share beers with would be angry.  So, I put those back.  I also decided that even though this is a more difficult beer to acquire in Wisconsin since its Russian River, I recalled that I saw it for sale online.  So, screw it, this is #1600.  Batch 001.  The cork popped out with a loud bang.  A carbonation haze slowly crept up out of the bottle.  I poured the beer into my glass and it was gorgeous.  A nice dark glowing orange body with a tall and lasting fizzy/foamy tan head.  The aroma is banana peels, dry soapy hops, lots of yeast, some hints of sweet milk chocolate.  The flavor is superseded by the palate as it hits my tongue.  A really creamy texture sticks to my tongue.  Almost slick.  The flavor is extremely yeasty with hints of chocolate, banana, pencil lead and pencil shavings, and black pepper.  The pencil flavors really pop out on this one.  I guess I can thank scotch for initially making this an apparent flavor in my mind.  I recall the Peat Monster that had pencil shavings in the flavor.

The flavor of this beer changes on the palate and is extremely unique.  Initial taste is super sweet, like grape juice, with just a touch of malt.  On the back of the palate you begin to pick up the malt, the alcohol, and the fruit flavors like peach and banana.  Heavy in the mouth, probably due to the strong alcohol.

Vinnie is at home when brewing highly experimental styles or when brewing authentic, die-hard researched styles like this.  I know that all sounds fun and dandy, but I bet Vinnie just makes shit up as he goes along with this.  But it still seems elegant and reserved.  Just goes to show that its not the brewery but the brewer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma is malty, figgy, fruity, with some definite banana nut bread and spice.  The flavor is caramel malty and spicy, with slight banana, nuts, cinnamon, and cacao.  The palate is medium and complex, with more malty and chocolate emerging as it warms, and the banana nut bread sensation remains throughout.  It actually seems to smooth out and get more subtle and velvety as it warms.  Another superb beer from Vinny Cilurzo and Russian River.

Dry, considering the malt; maybe thats what lean malt means. Medium thick feel, with tiny bubbles. Alcohol seems to dissolve the fruit aspects quickly. Dark fruit like dried grapes or plums, but only hints. Finishes with a sweet n sour aspect. Chocolate lays on the tongue.

Poured a deep amber, moslty clear and a frothy beige head.  Aroma is dominant with banana and clove similar to a hefe or dunkelweizen.  Along with this comes the traditional light earhty and woodiness that many RR beers have, some light salty barnyard and brett characteristics as well.

2337,"2006-04-08",3.9,"Batch 001, Sampled April 2006
Interesting notes of chocolate and coffee waft to my nose as I pour this beer into my glass.  The beer pours with a frothy, light tan colored head that is initially three-fingers thick.  The beer itself is a dark amber-brown color that shows a brilliantly clear, ruby-amber hue when held up to the light.  The aroma is an interesting thing  I was expecting more chocolate notes, but the first thing I get is a spicy, tart aromatic note.  The tartness is a mix of tamarind and grapes, but moves into a fruity raisin-like notes.  There is an earthy spiciness here that mixes with a woody, spicy oak-like note (I wasnt expecting the oak notes in this beer, nothing I have seen says it was aged in wood, but the notes are definitely there).  Towards the end it picks up the dark malt notes; notably a nice toasted malt note.

This beer is quite fruity up front, an interesting mix of prunes, fresh figs, and raisins.  The finish is quite contrasting to the fruit flavors up front; dry malt notes of toasted grain, sharp chocolate notes and lightly roasted coffee, again there seems to be some woody tannic notes and a bit of spicy oak.  This woody note is interesting as I dont think this was actually ever in contact with wood.  I think that the spicy oak and wood notes are perhaps attributed to some hot, spicy notes derived from fermentation.  This beer has a medium full mouthfeel to it; just enough to be a bit chewy, but note so much to keep this from beeing drinkable.  Definitely hits the dance between palate fullness and drinkability that strong beers from Belgian so often hit, but so often is missed by American brewers.

This is quite a good beer, but I think that it will improve quite a bit with some age, it should soften up and mellow a bit with at least 6 months or perhaps even a couple of years of age.  As the beer warms up it becomes a bit drier and the chocolate and toasted malt notes become a bit more prominent.  It also becomes a bit softer and rounder, and just a bit more easy to drink.  All in all a very interesting, characterful, complex brew.  I certainly think this will age quite well for many years.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2337,"2006-04-07",4.0,"Had this one while helping my buddy aspidites on St. Patricks Day. Pour is a reddish-brown/dark cherrywood look to it with a nice head. I didnt consume it out of the proper glasswear so I wont comment on the lacing. A rich, sweet aroma with a very strong malt and spice note. The taste is sweet and inviting, notes of bananna, candi sugar and malt. Very enjoyable beer. I dont expect anything but top notch beer from Russian River.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
2337,"2006-04-07",4.0,"I typically watch Russian Rivers website in hopes that Ill find that theyve put up another masterpiece in  bottles on sale. I somehow missed the ""launch"" of this and only now received my package. Comes in a 750mL bottle corked and caged. Batch number 001. Pours dark brown but when held up to the light it seems more a mahogany color. Its pillowy tan head doesnt linger for long. It sudsy but is not clinging to the glass much. Im using one of those breathable crystal wine glasses, so I dont know if it makes any difference. It seems to emanate alcohol in the nose, initially. Delving further brings out raisin, soft cocoa notes, light spice, light tobacco, light grape notes, and toasty malts. Taste seems a bit sweeter. Lots of fruit as well. Banana, raisins, light cocoa, chocolate covered peanuts, light pipe tobacco notes and creamy malt flavors. The body on this is creamy and smooth with a fluffy-ish feeling from the carbonation. Theres also a light warmth coming from the alcohol. It finishes with some dry fruit notes, lots of banana, some light dusty yeast and cocoa, sweet malts and chocolate.

2337,"2006-04-07",3.5,"4/6/06.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, bought at Hollingshead Deli 4/4/06.  Deep, dull russet color with a very large, frothy, thick, light beige head, rocky with a sponge-like look to it.  Lacing is extremely slow and sticky but sadly broken and disturbingly blotchy.  The beer has sort of a thin oily appearance that appears to separate awkwardly from the carbonation atop.  Still hard not to get excited about it.  Richly toasty, somewhat sweet fruit bread aroma with bright yeastiness, anise seed.  Flavor brings chocolate and spent tobacco with an almost discordant woody sourness to outline the bitter yeast and bright sweetness.  Finishes extremely complex and unique with a nutty character that outlines the tobacco, anise/alcohol bite, and supple bitterness.  The sour edge seems to fade a bit over the course of the bottle.  Im even getting some discordant broccoli notes in this, but I dont know if that was some weird residue from my dinner or its from the beer (even though I didnt eat broccoli or any sort of vegetables).  Moderately dry with a medium-full body and too little creaminess in the fuzzy carbonation.  The yeast in there frustratingly lends the beer much of its distinctive and interesting character but also seems to be too straightforwardly prominent in its own character, like shooting a vial of straight yeast after taking the last dirty puff from a cigar.  A strange and beguiling concoction, but nowhere near a resounding success.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Aroma isnt very powerful, but what does greet my nostrils, does so in a cloying kind of way.  Some pleasant apple pie is the highlight of the aromatic features.  The sweetness of the sugary apples is complimented by a nice balance of cinnimon spice and light pear aromas.  Texture is a little thin, with barely any carbonation and just a touch of raspberry and bread dough reveal itself during contemplation.  Finish is a bit watery with a smack of cherry juice.

2337,"2006-03-26",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2006 Batch 001: Purplish chestnut. Firm and retentive cream-colored foam. Delicate spicy and floral hop scents combine with hints of caramelized malt, anise, cinnamon, and passionfruit. Faintly cedary and yeasty. Dense and creamy carbonation. An array of succulently fruity esters greets the palate followed up with an understatedly rich and dryly woody bed of grains. Hops contribute a good amount of girth to the body with their stringy textures while generating a light breath of spicy anise heat. Alcohol lends merely a smidgeon  of warmth, but is otherwise undetectable. Doughy yeast provides a softer foundation to the impeccable level of attenuation that it has worked to achieve. Dry port wine flavors further accentuate the extravagant earthy malt display. Becomes more integrated toward the finish, as cedar, chocolate, and tobacco struggle to poke through. Supple pockets of passionfruit continue to underline the dainty sweetness, before finishing slightly chewy and yeasty with nutty malts adorning the touch of lightly kilned dryness. Good heavens!
