Whoa! An explosive uncorking caught me by surprise, but didnt follow with the expected gusher. (And before we go any further: Im sorry, but does anybody else whos graduated high school and endured a valedictorian speech find long strange trip to be an unbearable cliché? Because I sure do.) Anyway. This was a bit of a gamble on my part: on the one hand, it was a year past its best-before. On the other, it was a high-ABV Boulevard Smokestack. I decided it was worth the risk. I have no regrets. I prefer a bone-dry Tripel, and this one tends sweet, but it still has decent Belgian character. Given the complete lack of hop character and the high ABV, I can say with a fair degree of certainty that this will keep forever, BB dates be damned. It might not be a home run, but its at least a triple. (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Quite a lot going on in the aroma: the usual honey and orange aromas from a tripel, banana esters and light spices, fairly prominent yeasts that, at least with foreknowledge, seem reflect an American character, even a Boulevard character. The flavor is relatively sweet, white grape juice bringing honey and spice with plenty of citrus and citrus rind. Very late the yeast character confers a spiced bitterness that is not entirely pleasant. Smooth and a bit oily on the tongue, not too much heat.

Popped the cork, poured a liquid of ripe-apricot color into my snifter, and watched as it loaded itself immediately with a massive, pillowy, dense head. Light bananas and clove on the nose, and then a cotton-soft, sweet and sour on my tongue. A delicate explosion of yeast in an array of fruit and spice from inside the creamy liquid coats my entire mouth; the yeast coming sliding under my tongue and titillating my salivary glands. It gives me a wonderful reason to tip the glass again.

Poured a golden, straw, semi-clear color with 6-to-7 fingers of pillowy off-white head. Couldnt believe how much head there was in the pour. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Tons of foamy lacing along the sides of the glass. Very good retention on the top. Worst part of the beer by far. Way too much foamy head.

Smelled banana, cloves, caramel, honey, Belgian spices, faint Circus Peanuts and fruity notes.

Tasted similar to the nose. Very good. Could definitely taste the booze (9.20% ABV). Got cloves, Belgian spices, banana, honey, caramel malt, some Circus Peanuts, green apples, pears and some kiwi. Similar to most Tripels, but just better.

Medium-to-light body. Creamy-to-oily texture. Lively carbonation. Long, somewhat spicy finish.

Just a fantastic Tripel. It may be the best Ive ever had. So good.","","User134089"

It quickly forms a huge really delicate looking almost fluffy white head on top of a mildly cloudy golden body thats filled with unfiltered small particles floating about in the glass.

Belgian yeast with white candied sugars, green apple skin, a almost fruit pommelo zesty citrus sting and something that reminds me of sand. A good amount of flavor. In the mouth it feels gliding and oily while the bubbles ate just above average. Belgian flavors with sharp yeast, dried white sweet fruits, green apples and even some white sugary sweetness. Not much to say on the alcohol taste here until the warming almost peppery aftertaste really kicks in - that suits this just fine.

Yeast is apparent in flavor with light sweet fruits in middle and some grain from the malt followed by spiciness in finish.  Medium body with sticky mouthfeel and prickly carbonation.  Good and surprisingly drinkable at 9%.  Doesn't have as much depth as the best Belgian tripels but is complex enough to be enjoyable and well made.  Got this in a holiday mixed four pack.  Would definitely buy again.

3268,"2012-08-26",3.8,"12 oz bottle. Not much aroma. Thin head. A touch sweet but not overly so - especially for a triple. Decent triple but not outstanding.","Virginia, USA","climberbob"
3268,"2012-08-25",4.1,"750mL bottle poured into a weizen glass.

A: Pours a golden amber shade with fantastic color quality. The body is a little lighter near the bottom of the glass, with prevalent trails of carbonation throughout. The head is a four finger white color with a thin texture and lowish retention. As the head recedes, spotty clumps of lace are left on the glass. Becomes quite hazy once more of the yeast is poured in, while little floaties sink to the bottom.

S: There are quite a bit of varying tropical fruits, but not in a hop-driven manner. Notes of banana, apricot, papaya, and mango exist on the nose, with a heaping helping of candied sugar and some malt. Just a nice smelling beer in general.

T: I kind of feared it would be overly sweet (always a precaution I have with tripels), but its quite neutral, in a good way. Tropical fruits open up the flavor profile nicely, before becoming fairly malty, with augmenting yeast giving it a flavor reminiscent of banana bread. Gradually, the initial light sweetness transforms into a pleasant bitterness, with a kiss of finishing phenols; while some herbs and spices (coriander, thyme, rosemary) appear between the mid-taste and finish. Once the beer opens up, a nicely subtle hop profile appears, helping to augment the light bitterness without harming the overall (solid) balance. Its not ultra complex, but at the same time, its hardly simple.

M: Not as carbonated as the fizzy-looking body may suggest, which I like. Carbonation is still moderately high, but at least it isnt making me insanely gassy. It could stand to be a little lighter in body, though, especially near the finish, where it becomes thicker in texture. The yeast imparts a pleasant lingering aftertaste (not too bitter or sweet) without being too astringent and dry, while the alcohol becomes very hard to detect when its colder. Let it reach room temperature, however, and it will become faintly boozy - nothing that detracts, however.

O: Any high-gravity monster of a beer that I can polish off an entire 750mL bottle (with the proper amount of time and patience) of has to be damn good. By no means is it a chugger, but goddamnit its Friday, so by God Im drinking this whole bottle by myself!

I have enjoyed this beer for a long time but I decided to final rate the recent 4-packs of lil smokies.  The beer pours with a medium-large, firm, strong, and thick head.  Not overly large and never fully fades.  Ends up as a swamp of lacing atop the beer.  The color is a hazy thick golden.  Carbonation bubbles are readily available and long lasting within the body.  Aroma is strong on esters, as the description states.  Its banana but a thick malty banana.  Airy Belgian yeastiness abound as well.  Sweet cookie malts as well.  Flavor is much lighter than the aroma makes one think.  A thinned out banana with much less cookie maltiness.  The mouthfeel than kicks it back into what one expects from the nose.  A nice full, felt beer.  The carbonation is subdued by the thicker mouthfeel.  Leaves a kind of bittered banana mouthfeel.  Surprisingly drier than expected.  The bottom of the bottle is full of sediment.  For those that abhor sweeter or estery tripels will rebuke such a beer.

Sweet aroma of honeysuckle, soft fruit tones like peach, white grape, apricot, and light spices, subtle clove.  Flavor is actually pretty different from aroma, medium to full bodied, and actually pretty complex.  Malty, yeasty fruit tones turn into a carbonated, sweet, spiced bite, which turns to a sort of dryness with white grape, to a breadiness, to a long finish that ultimately leaves traces of peach, apricot.

A - Hazy apricot with a decent sized, foamy, white head. Pretty good retention with a thin layer of lace left.

S - Tart apple, pear and orchard fruit are quite strong. A good level of spiciness as well. Touches of candi sugar and a hint of Belgian yeast. Sweet and spicy aromas mix, with the spiced aspect winning out.

T - Like the nose, a strong spicy flavor with clove, white pepper, and a touch of orange rind. Tart golden fruit also makes up a large portion of the flavor. Background of sweet candi sugar and a slight fruity sweetness. Hints of yeast. Alcohol is definitely present, but not overly strong.

M - Medium body and carbonation. A little too sticky/syrupy for my liking.

D - With the strong spice, slight alcohol, and syrupy body this isnt overly drinkable and one that I took my time with. That said I wouldnt mind having one a different day.

Notes: Not entirely sure what to think of this. The flavors were nice, but then I thought they got to be a little overwhelming. Strong on the spices but a slight sweetness in the background.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

The flavor found honey (darker grade) and sourdough again at the core with white pepper, coriander, and lemon zest around.. as it warmed up, the alcohol presence intensified and played well with the dusty yeast and spices.. memorable spice array on the finish.

Soft carbonation up front that tickles the tongue with a heavy yeast medium body. Lots of earthy funk that again is not sour or acidic. Lots of estery light golden fruit, especially apple, pear and most prominent, banana. Nice peppery spice with a bit of zesty corriander that is slightly countered by a subtle malt backbone.

3268,"2009-11-03",3.7,"GLASS: Tripel Karmeliet Goblet 
TEMP: Cellared at approx. 50 degrees 

After removing the the cage, the cork is removed with a loud, satisfying pop. The mist-like vapors coming from the bottle send the scent of honey and malt up to my nose, briefly.

The pour results in quite an impressive head. Thick creamy white foam that stands on its own for a good 60 - 75 seconds. When it finally settles, Im left with a liquid that is an amber color, not unlike a beautiful sunset.

Pulling the glass close to my nose, I smell honey, pepper, citrus, malt, and floral. Quite alot happening in the nose.

Tasting it is worth the wait. Once again the honey notes come to the forefront. They are joined by peaches and oranges mingling with maltiness, a bit of hops buried down a level or two, and a very nice pepperiness.

The nice thing about Tripels, in general, is the way they feel in your mouth. The liquid has what seems like thousands of tiny little bubbles and in each mouthful it seems that hundreds of these bubbles get into every space of your mouth.
This results in a wonderfully creamy sensation when drinking one.

Overall, this is a great example of what an American made Tripel can be.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

3268,"2009-03-18",4.0,"Deep gold. Enormous white head forms with a gentle pour. Attractive lace and great retention. Highly phenolic nose with sweet scents of orange blossom honey, crackery malt and baked pears swirled with aniseed, clove, bubblegum and floral hops. Fairly herbal and mineralic with hints of honeydew melon as well. Spacious carbonation condenses and softens as it graces the palate. Remarkably clean and focused, initially. Dryly malty and appropriately light in weight with a vividly defined honey-drizzled Munich toastiness which gently deflects the bright and explosively juicy Styrians. Though the attenuation is immaculate, there remains enough space for a sugary sweetness which pillars the airy core with a vibrant rumlike richness. Light note of baked apples is distant enough so as to not muddle too much of the lustrous nuance. Mild tang of honeydew melon and a juicy kiss of fresh peach seamlessly mesh with the softer hop and fluffy bubblegum aspects. Appetizingly crisp and airy phenols underscore the clean malts which continue to crackle robustly. Closes firmly mineralic with an herbal edge of hop bitterness alongside a trailing medley of bubblegum, black pepper and faint malt. A lovely Tripel, displaying an array of lively esters and phenols. Far from being wet/flabby, overly sweet and yeasty/banana-heavy, as so many American examples tend to turnout. On the hoppier side of the spectrum, too, with loads of hop flavor and refined, understated bitterness. Very rustic yet sophisticated.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3268,"2009-03-14",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2012 Bottle.

Head is initially large, frothy/fizzy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy dark yellow, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain/bread/cracker, husks), lightly hoppy (herbs), lightly to moderately yeasty (basement/cement), with light notes of pepper, gum, alcohol.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky.

Medium to full body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

In recent years this has lost a lot of its brightness and vibrancy, becoming more malty/grainy and phenolic (cement/pepper)...almost dull, in fact.  Nicely balanced in the mouth for the style, if a little grainy.  Its a decent tripel, but no longer the 4+ wonder that it once was.  Still a lot better than most overly sweet banana bombs in this country calling themselves tripels, though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3268,"2008-12-27",3.7,"750mL bottle.  Pours a very hazy golden orange with a massive fluffy white head that stays as an inch-thick cap for the duration.  The carbonation bubbling up from the bottom is huge.

The smell is very sweet with light fruit and candi sugar but there is definitely some citrus hops as well, especially lemons.

The taste is sweet but has a more dominant Belgian yeast backbone that maintains a bready character throughout.  The lemons hit up front with some sugary sweetness in the middle.  The finish has the slightest bitterness from the hops and some generous spices.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an exceptional amount of carbonation, possibly a tad too much.  Overall, its very creamy but with lots of activity on the palate.

3268,"2008-12-17",3.2,"750ml bottle. Pours a hazy, dull golden orange. Huge fizzy, fluffy, dense white head that dissipates slowly and remains moderately lacy. Big malt profile in the aroma as well as a dominating sweet fruitiness. Belgian yeast strain and sweet, light, herbal spices. Coriander. Citrus and banana. Pretty standard tripel smell to it and not very complex, but still nice. Taste seems to be lacking some balance. Very clean, sweet, sugary, and carbonated, but less yeast and bread taste than most other similar styled beers. Initially malty and quickly moves to a citrus hop, spicy, and slightly dry finish. Palate is medium bodied and carbonated with a little bit of warming alcohol. Overall, a good beer, just a little off. The aroma suggests a higher malt backing than the taste, which is why it seems a little off when balanced with the hops and spices. I guess it doesnt compare to the best tripels out there, but not bad for a local brew. Probably my least favorite of the smokestack series so far.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Medium-bodied, with fine assertive carbonation that scrubs your tongue into a mildly dry finish; a touch of astringency and some alcohol heat on the exhale. Apple, pear, white pepper and alcohol drive toward a spicy, moderately dry finish. This is an interesting tripel, one that you can tell started a bit sweeter when it was bottled (this past winter).

My nose detected a simple Belgian yeast and spice combination that is in the traditional abbey style of aroma. As for the flavor, there is a strong delivery of alcohol and over spiced yeast that packs a punch to the taste buds.

Smells very fresh, earthy, with spicy malts to the fore and some mild citrus aromas too. A wee bit of alkie heat is immediately present, but its nothing overpowering. Instead, theres a strong hop presence, almost peppery, that complements the yeasty funk quite nicely. Chewy body, lingers nicely on the mouth, and a pleasant finish.

3268,"2008-09-09",3.4,"Batch Number: T8123; Sampled September 2008
There is lots of banana in this beer, first it smells of it as I am pouring this beer, but also the foam tastes of banana.  Speaking of foam an not overly hard saw the head start to flow over the sides of my 25cl tulip glass, but I was able to react fast enough to slurp all of the excess foam; so no mess.  The head stands a full four-fingers in height (including a finger above the rim of my glass) and is a pale tan color that is more the color of cream than anything.  The beer is a has a nice copper hue to it as it sits on my desk, but shows a mostly clear, deep gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma is a mix of grassy grain, spicy esters and fruit.  Aromatic notes of bananas, definite clove, clean pepper, bubblegum / almost juicy-fruit esters, dusty-crushed grain aromas, a touch of unsalted saltine cracker, an at times strong green apple note and a touch of warming alcohol are all easily noticeable (none are a stretch for me) if you spend a little time with the nose).

Well carbonated still (even after resting for the last ten minutes), the beer foams up as it rolls across my tongue.  Fairly dry, but it still has some sweetness that is accentuated by the fruity esters and the higher alcohol notes that pepper this beer.  Sweet, malt accented banana flavors mix with sweet clove notes, touches of cotton candy, wild-flower honey, and ripe melon notes provide the sweet flavors in this beer.  The sweetness is only lightly offset by pepper-like higher alcohol notes in the finish, a spicy clove notes in the finish that gets turpene heavy, a touch of dried ginger and a light astringency and bitterness that lingers on in the finish.  Fairly light bodied as a decent Tripel should be, it has a touch of viscous heft to it, but is far more quaffable than a 9% alcohol beer should be.

Can be a bit too hot and phenolic at times, but this is certainly an interesting Tripel.  This is even tasty enough and I am certainly happy to find myself quaffing this for an evening.

3268,"2008-07-17",3.7,"750 ml bottle.  So this is the last of the Smokestack beer for me to try...  So far I would rate the series as a very pleasant surprise, so expectations are pretty high.  Pour demonstrates very heavy carbonation (inch or two of beer, the rest of the glass is head).  What beer there is is orange with a slight cloudiness to it.  Aromas are sweet (honey and glazed donut), a touch or cloves and oranges and some alcohol.  Flavor is OK, but maybe it needs some time to balance things out a little better.  The alcohol comes off as a bit sharp and burns a bit... almost overpowering the rest of the flavors.  The sweetness, cloves and citrus flavors come through, but get a bit swamped by all of the astringency.  Still, this is enjoyable enough, but all remaining bottles I buy will be the IPA from the series.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

-A frothy head of foam tops the hazy blond.
-The body is healthy and the carbonation ample; this is quite authentic a mouthfeel, and the same can be said of their other Belgian-style ales Ive had.
-Alcohol is very well hidden, slightly warming.
-Even though this is very well brewed, I didnt feel compelled to go back to this one at all, whereas their Saison was just brimming with life and so engaging.

L: Given a careful pour, but some of the yeast sediment does escape the bottle, orangey copper in color with a pale beige head of fluffed cream, excellent head retention, light amounts of splotchy lace dots and chunks ring the glass. Overall, not a bad looking tripel.

S: Woody, herbal aroma from the Styrian Golding hops, followed by the fruity smells of pears, mangoes and oranges. Further whiffs brings out the peppery medicinal alcohol and the bready malted wheat. Touches of white sugar and nutty pale malts as well. The more I take in the aroma, more the complexity of this tripel emerges, I have to say Im impressed.

F&T: Airy and moderate bodied, this has a nicely dry, creamily crisp feel to it, quite the easy sipper. A delectable blend of malts, sweetly nutty from the pale malts, coffee-ish from the Munich malts, and bread doughy from the malted wheat, this certainly fills the tripel malt bill. The malts are complement by the low grade warmth from the spicy clove and peppery alcohol and the dextrose sugars. Just past the middle a light fruitiness adds to the taste, apricots, pears and melons. Finishes aridly dry, sweet malty with a deliciously tingling herbal spiciness on the tongue, finishing one sip makes me want to greedily take another.

I thought Long Strange Tripel was a well thought, finely crafted brew. Highly enjoyable sipper, this is an ale that I will be spending the rest of night with.

Aroma: Some citrus esters, spicy pepper, candi sugar, and light touches of bubblegum.  Taste is citrus esters, light bubblegum, pepper, honey, and candi sugar.  Body is on the heavier side for a tripel, but it has a nice, creamy, well rounded body than doesnt hinder drinkability.  This was my first Boulevard beer, and it was pretty solid.  Looking forward to trying more.  Thanks for sharing Trevor.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3268,"2008-01-29",3.6,"Courtesy boboski.  Pours medium golden-orange with a medium, frothy  white head.  The foam settles to a small, wispy film, leaving scant traces of lacing behind.  The aroma shows creamy citrus chiffon, orange, lemon, candy sugar, and some bready yeast.  A good dose of floral hops are detectable, adding good balance to the nose.  The flavor follows suit, with dried citrus fruity notes, light caramel, and good hop character.  The mouthfeel is slightly more full than medium bodied, though much of that comes from the sugar content.  Finishes on the sweeter side of things.  Pretty solid, unique Tripel.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3268,"2008-01-05",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2009 750ml, first bottling.  Dispensed into a proper Boulevard Smokestack goblet.  Sweet, fruity and spicy aroma, pleasantly enticing with notes of melon, pear, tangerine, honey, doughy yeast, peppery spice and faint wafts of floral perfume.  Light-medium golden-amber color, translucent and lightly sedimented with a lasting, very fine head.  Flavor is primarily sweet and malty to start, sugary and full, then seeing a moderate dose of spicy hop bitterness and flavor, mingling with the strong yeast esters and a touch of peppery, warming alcohol at the finish, which is lengthy and shows fading hints of lemon cake and  toasty, grainy and sweet malts once more.  Active on the palate with a delicate acidity and a full body.

3268,"2007-12-28",3.9,"Bottle from Tom and served in my Tripel Karmeliet glass: Pours a rich deep golden hue with a large frothy head which fades leaving good lace. The aroma has notes of apricot, tangerine and pear esters along with Belgian sugar, caramel and pils malt, pepper and coriander, classic yeast and phenols. The taste starts with a fruity sweetness and sugared simple syrup background before a more grainy aspect takes over. The finish is sharply spicy and noticeable alcohol presence. The mouth feel is sprite and that along with the alcohol kept the palate clean and sweetness in check. All in all a solid example of the style and geek worthy.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

The flavor is much the same as the orange peel and candy sugar make up most of this beers identity.

Again with some apples in the flavor, with the lightest bit of caramel, or maybe toasted character.  Nice phenolics, and some really good hop character.  The alcohol isnt warm, but you can tell its there.

Clean alcohol is hiding in the back. Color between straw and gold with a one fingered head and steady carbonation. Slight haze, no apparent sediment (a very small amount at the end). Initial taste is clean, sweet malt, light wheat, & candi sugar followed by a good amount of fruity and floral esters and spicy phenols reminiscent of black pepper. There is also a mild earthiness to the beer. Alcohol is present at the finish, it is not aggressive and is integrated well in the beer. Nice full body due to the carbonation.

yeast is evident in the nose with alcohol, honey, wheat bread, and unknown peppery spice hint.
this is a tasty little beer. not overpowering, enjoyable throughout without beating me over the head with anything in particular.  light fruit and alcohol at first that is a bit sweet then a yeasty bread flavors kicks in and this finishes dry. honeysuckle flavor is nice, sweet mixes with floral in this well. cant recall if i was told if any spices were added or if this is all hops and yeast here, but it is good. i hate to steal from someone else, but kaggie is on to something when he says peach flavors. not strong, but hints. i like this one.","Montana, USA","Kevin"

Aug 10, 2006: Experimental 12-oz. bottle. Pours a dense, dark straw color topped by a light white head. Initial fruity/raisiny aromas. A full mouthfeel pairs with a very dry pale malt flavor and medium body. The early ""spicey"" character mellows into the subtl malt, with only a slight hint of yeast flavor contribution, and no noticable alcohol character.
