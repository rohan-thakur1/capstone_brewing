2326,"2017-03-26",4.5,"Enjoyed with ebone1988 and Gus for the 1st Bi-annual Day of Surprises Boondoggle. 750 mL bottle. The first of the inaugural El Catador membership. The pour is a dark, dark brown/light black with a light ruby around the edge and a lack of head and lace. The aroma is fantastic. There is a beautiful dark fruit and caramel to it. Its like a lightly alcohol soaked raisin with a light charred oak and a sweet caramel. The flavor is just as good. Its so smooth and balanced. The dark fruits and caramel work wonders together. The complexity and light bourbon just are fantastic. The mouth feel is thicker and softly carbonated with a lingering caramel and dark fruits. Im really a fan of this one. This is superlatively, unquestionably, and indisputably Absolutely Okay.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2326,"2017-03-26",4.5,"Bottle shared with koleminer20 and Gus for the 1st bi-annual Day of Surprises Boondoggle. Our first El Catador bottle! Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, caramel, barrel, vanilla, dark fruit, roasted malt, incredibly complex. Appearance is dark dark brown, light brown head, mostly opaque. Taste is amazing. Caramel, molasses, bourbon, barrel, chocolate, vanilla, so so so good. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy body, light carbonation, excellent caramel bourbon chocolate aftertaste. Overall, Im blown away by this one. Its absolutely ok. I guess.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
