Also, that it was brewed by Crazy Mountain Brewing Company in Denver, CO. My comments are going to end up longer than this rating. Goodness. Aroma: Lactose forward and a little tart fruitiness besides; salt isnt far behind. Appearance: Mostly still light copper with a bubbly tan head that settles into a wispy skin. Flavor: Lactose and fruit tartness up front; tartness lingers and is met with salt towards the finish, but not totally quenched. Palate: Light body, slick texture, soft carbonation, long finish.

3567,"2016-12-08",4.0,"0,33L bottle bought at the Bottle Shop Hong Kong. 
Appearance: Pours a cloudy, bright yellow colour with white head that looks very creamy.
Aroma: Dominated by Citrus, mango and tropical fruits such as lemon, passionfruit with some pineapple.
Taste: Strong and intense tartness and acidity of lemon and mango. No bitterness at all. There is some very mild saline taste (from the rock salt?) when swallow.
Palate: The texture is quite creamy which is quite unusual compared to ordinary gose or sour ales. Is it because of the lactose that contribute to this creamy texture? The body is on the light side. Fruity and tart aftertaste. The tartness of the mango and lemon kicks back strongly afterwards.
Overall: A very enjoyable gose with extremely aromatic and pungent aromas of tropical fruits like mango, citrus and lemon. The tartness or acidity is not as strong as some sour ales out there, yet it is pronounced enough to give some freshnesses and juicinesses in hot summer days. The appearance of the beer is unbelievably beautiful. In fact, I have admired the bright yellow liquid and foamy white head for quite a bit. The drawing of the fur on the bottle has also uplifted the overall sensation of this gose.

3567,"2016-07-30",4.2,"One of Omnipollos variations on the Gose theme, with rock salt and the exotic addition of mango puree. Moussy, off-white, lightly lacing head breaking in the middle but otherwise more or less retaining, over an initially very lightly hazy, warm and pure golden coloured beer with thin but fierce strings of bubbles rising up here and there, a pretty sight, but evidently turning a misty ochre with yeast sediment added. Unusual but very refined, fascinating aroma of yoghurt, sweet mango chutney, cheddar, Sauerkraut, lemon pickle, passion fruit, goat cheese, lime juice, leavened bread. Crisp, sour onset with bright sharpish fruit acidity (lemon, unripe green plum, sour berries) through which some of the mango sweetness pierces in a subtle way, but softening the whole a bit; carbonation is spritzy and minerally, but not too sharp. After this sourness with a trace of exotic mango sweetness woven through, the rock salt comes in, resulting in a somewhat Sauerkraut-like flavor as is often the case in Goses; underneath a soft bready malt and wheat base provides a mellow, perfectly fit basic structure for this fascinating follow-up of flavors. The lemony acidity continues till all the way at the back and lends a citric flavor to the finish; there is also a soft dairy-like, somewhat yoghurty aspect, but less lactic character than in most other Goses I tasted so far. All the way at the root of the tongue, a brief, earthy hop bitterness can be felt, helping the lemon sourness to dry the ending while a thin trace of the mango sweetness is left behind in the middle of it. Gose is a style which keeps fascinating me: ancient, then extinct, then (near the end of the 20th century) resurrected in the traditional way, and now elaborated upon by creative craft brewers. This one surely stretches the classic properties of the style, but does so in a very noble, refined way, atypical as it may be. A real gem of pure and delicate beauty, I highly recommend this to anyone who can enjoy sour beer styles.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

The first sniff, damn it, pissy pungent! Unripe fruits later on, a hint of its extreme green raw sourness... Tastes really sweet n sour, unripe tropical fruits... very green, close to tomato haft. Yea, green tomato rather than mango, or if mango, then unripe ones. Raw, really raw. The sweet and sour are really battling in this one, cant say whos winning, but Id rather they not do that. A tiny saltiness hangs in the roof of the mouth after swallowing, whereas in the throat its the same sweet and sour (this time, the sour seems to be winning). Light on the palate, but a bit too overcarbonated. Definitely more interesting - and at that, more controversial - than the last few doped up Goses Ive had.

3567,"2015-11-09",4.2,"Pours a vibrant, hazy peach pulp - golden color, with a froth, one finger broad head.

Smells of a unique, mineralic saltiness which even more amazingly blends flawlessly into sappy exotic fruits, tied together by white bread earth. Reminds me of a sour fruit bonbon, while revealing a refreshing fruit note of papaya, orange and lemon, with no sugary sweetness to it at all. 

Fruits and lively carbonation provide a smooth mouthfeel, with a zingy sourness coating them up. Has a very light, but fulfilling body, utmost refreshing and light in the finish, due its salt supported lactic sourness.

Tastes of smooth exotic fruits from the very beginning, with a soft minerally flavor to them, revealing a whiff of bread balanced salt. This invites a medium lactic sourness to the palate, adding an unripe, sour quality to the fruits, which turns even more pronounced during the beers finish, as its initial fruit quality vanishes. That opens up the tastebuds to an even more focussed and present sourness, gently balanced by a stony bread foundation, with just a whiff of salt to it, also featuring a smoothing aqueous softness.

Utmost refreshing and witty, while sticking to its style, even by adding a skillfully entangled juicy fruit note, creating a pleasant depth to the beers otherwise very light body.","GERMANY","aleigator"
