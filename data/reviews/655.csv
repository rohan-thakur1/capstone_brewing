655,"2017-06-02",4.3,"Drank from a glass, poured from a bottle, 
this beer was dark brown in the glass, and gave a off-white / light tan cover of bubbles, it left nice spots and fingers of lacing on the glass, 

when I first popped the cap, I got a nice mix of caramel and chocolate mixed with big malty notes, 
it had aromas of dark and intense toasted malt, caramel, toffee, dark candy, a little horehound in the background, faint dark fruit (similar to raisin and date), 
faint earthy and smokey aromas on the nose, faint alcohol esters, and brown sugar sweetness, 

the flavors were malty, dark intense malt, caramel, dark candy, brown sugar, 
the finish had a bit of a alcohol spice bitterness to give some balance to the malt and sweetness, the malt layers and coats the tongue, 
faint chocolate in the background, caramel and dark candy hung around, 

this beer leaned towards the full side in the mouth, there was soft to average carbonation, and it was creamy and coated the mouth with each drink, 

the nose was great with a generous malt notes, the flavors were just as nice as the aromas, 
a very nice Scotch from AleSmith.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

655,"2017-05-29",4.0,"From a bomber. Pours a dark brown and makes a thin beige head. Not much lacing. I recommend letting this ale warm up a bit if you have it stored in a fridge. (I would cellar). Aroma is of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and booze. Tastes of dark fruits (plum, raisin, currant), cherries, roasted malts, complex yeasts, and molasses. This is a beautiful interpretation of the scotch ale style. One of the best.

Soft fruity onset (hints of fig, raisin, blue plum) with a touch of blackberry sourishness and residual brown sugar sweetness, softish carbo; thick, fluffy, moelleux and full mouthfeel. Notably caramelly and toffeeish malt middle with ongoing brown sugar sweetness leading to a softly toasted bitterish ending with faint coffee-like features as well as a touch of herbal hop bitterness; oxidation is there and returns retronasally, but in this luscious environment, I cannot be bothered by it. This is a deliciously rich beer, Scotch indeed if you count in the roasted bitterish accent, but it remains a subtle addition, so that the whole feels more like a quadrupel than like a true wee heavy to me.

655,"2015-08-27",4.1,"BOD 2/11/14. Pours a clear rich mahogany. Normal head volume, lacing and retention.

Outstanding, but of moderate intensity, complex nose of caramel, dark fruit (fig, date, raisin, prune) and molasses with a touch of alcohol.

Light full body with an almost creamy texture. World class carbonation with a nice effervescent burst in the middle and a robust finely bubbled burst in the finish.

The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, complex and well balanced. It doesnt quite cover the alcohol and lacks the robust flavor of the world class Scottish Ales. It begins with a wave of dark fruit - mostly prune, but raisin and fig are evident. Towards the middle tobacco is present as the malts begin to assert themselves. A moderate sweetness constitutes the middle as caramel and molasses. The heavy prune notes are always present, but are somewhat balanced in the middle. The finish is a slow fade of prune and molasses coupled with a bit of an alcohol bite. Dial the alcohol back a point or so and this could challenge for world class. The alcohol tends to overwhelm the rich flavors this ale has and results in the prune flavor dominance noted.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

655,"2015-05-29",4.4,"25 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at ~45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep, dark mahogany brown, and forms two fingers of pale tan head with fantastic retention. The head itself leaves almost sheetlike lacing on the glass as it recedes, and the rest of the lacing is appropriately thick as well.

Smell: Thick, heavy toffee and caramel, sweet and bready, rush out of the glass like kilt-clad highlanders in Pictish war paint howling a battle cry as they charge downhill, swords in hand. Theres a hint of some raisin in there as well, like the wrinkled old highlander marching behind them, playing the bagpipes, caring not that hes walking into a battlefield unarmed. Hes crazy, that raisin. Oh, and you can smell faint leather as well, which makes sense, because baldrics and boots and such. To battle!

Taste: That aforementioned toffee and caramel? It came to fight. Those are the first flavors that greet the tongue, the vanguard of the assault, before the rank and file troops hit as a wall of warm dark bread. Somewhere in the swirling chaos of malty melee, that raisin rings out, like strains of Scotland the Brave played within the roar of battle and the screams of the dying. As the beer moves along, tones of leather and damp, peaty earth appear, fitting for a field of war soaked in sweat and blood. The ABV also makes an appearance towards the finish, a sudden surge of heat as the victors set fire to the homes and lands of the fallen.

Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, full, rich, and sticky, this latches on to ones teeth and does not let go easily.

Overall: Quite a good wee heavy, with intense malt flavors and just enough earthy bitter, and the mouthfeel and appearance one wants from this style nailed perfectly. The only complaints I have, if one can even call them that, is a relative paucity of dark fruit complexity (I get only raisin from this one), and some unconcealed heat from the ABV. Its still a heck of a wee heavy, and a heck of a beer!","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Pours a dark brown with a small head and some lacing on the glass.

The aroma is lightly boozy with a big rich malt character, some light roast, and some mild toffee with a bit of cherry in there.

The flavor is pleasantly sweet with a light smokiness. Its got a lot of chocolate malty character to it. Its really rich and fairly restrained on the booziness, which is not to say that that particular aspect doesnt lend to a nice warming bit that fits the beer nicely. 

Its a style I normally dont get too excited over... many of them are awfully smoky, or worse over run with caramel malt sweetness.

Deep burnish bronze beer, nice bright edges. A dense half-inch of light tan foam sits proudly atop for the duration of the tasting.
Nose is rich, deeply complex & layered; treacle, Speyside singlemalt, toffee, cocoa, butterscotch, floral heather, dried fruits, faint peaty earthiness. 
Substantially thick, chewy, sticky, LONG on the palate, subdued creamy carbonation.
All emcompasiing sweetness upfront on the palate - lots of burnt caramel, treacle, golden syrup & butter on toasted crumpets, leading into dark chocolate, dark plums, dried fruits of sultana and date, and continues to more earthy notes of mild peat smoke, leafy hops & woody spice, finally ending with a lingering grippy bitterness and Whisky-like boozy embrace.
Rarely do beers seriously take me away to somewhere else, but I am very taken by this - seems so perfectly attuned for the style to the point where the idea of style is thrown out the window and one can become almost poetic with their evaluation.

OCZY : piwo ma kolor ciemnobrązowy z odcieniami wiśni. Ale z daleka wydaje się po prostu czarne. Piana piwa ma kolor ciemnego beżu. Nie jest wielka, całkiem zbita. Po czasie kompletnie znika zostawiając pierścień i lacing. 

NOS : po chwilowym odstaniu piwo na pierwszy niuch emanuje silnym aromatem toffi, suszonych śliwek, czekolady, banana, delikatnie kawy i alkoholu. To co się dzieje z nim po wstrząśnięciu jest niesamowite. Na wierzch wychodzą świeże aromaty gumy balonowej o wielu rożnych smakach, miedzy innymi truskawka, wiśnia, rodzynki. Natomiast cala reszta intensywnieje i świetnie współgra. 

USTA : piwo jest geste i oleiste. Ma konsystencje soku bananowego i niewielkie nasycenie. 
Piwo jest słodkie i rozgrzewające. Wyraźne nuty słodowe to przede wszystkim intensywne ciacho czekoladowe z toffi i rodzynkami popijane kieliszeczkiem starego porto. Do tego delikatne nuty palone osadzają się głęboko w przełyku, razem z rozgrzewającym alkoholem tworzy się prawdziwa poezja smaku. No ładnie. Chyba jestem pod sporym wrażeniem. Gorzkość jest delikatna a posmak przypomina suszone śliwki i porto. 

ODCZUCIA : piłem już kilka dobrych ejli w tym stylu ale bez dwóch zdań to wybiega daleko na przód. Tak jak nigdy nie bylem pod wrażeniem tego stylu tutaj można spokojnie się zastanowić nad tym jak ten styl w dobrym wydaniu pełni funkcje pomostu miedzy belgijskim quadem a amerykańskim RISem.

655,"2014-03-19",4.0,"Year old bottle.


Look: Dark, golden pour with huge, thick (small bubbles at start), creamy, light mocha head. Has medium speed retention (small bubbles breaking down into bigger ones and then collapsing), goes down with some sticky lacing, leaves creamy, puffy top layer. The layer leaves some fine lacing when you drink it. Its clear, deep, dark amber, can barley see through. 


Smell: Rich yet smooth and fresh. First association are raisins in sugary scotch. The fruity part is mostly dark fruits, white grapes, plums and some dry fruits like raisins. It creates most of the fresh part. Malt character is also very well developed - burned and brown sugar, honey, molasses, light smoke, milk chocolate and roast. Nothing spikes out, its smooth and pleasant. Also some oak and earthy notes to play with the present alcohol, scotch notes. Alcohol/fusel is noticeable, but suits the overall complexity and is not distracting.


Taste: Medium heavy molasses, honey, caramel, chocolate start, continues the same path to full-on molasses with smoke (ash; stronger than in smell) and roast sweetness. Dark, dry fruits, raisins with scotch/rum stick around. Ends with light alcohol/stronger scotch and medium sweetness - that creates medium bitterness with light sour. Also some oak comes out in the after-taste. Lots of caramel and molasses sweetness stays on your lips when time goes on. 


Mouthfeel: Full medium heavy, melting carbonation, very creamy and smooth. Light warming of the alcohol at the end, but goes with the overall concept and it should be there.


Overall: Probably one of the best examples of this style, the alcohol notes are present but get a bit annoying only in the taste (that last spike of bitterness). Smell is rich and smooth, could smell it all day, the taste is smooth enough and makes me appreciate the scotch ale style a bit more (not my favourite). The appearance and mouthfeel are superb. A bit of ageing could probably make it even smoother.","SLOVENIA","tmzl"

I am not a scotch ale person, but Wee Heavy has changed my mind. Its a rare thing to find a beer that carries the weight of its style but still manages to assert a character that cant be found anywhere else. Alesmith does just that routinely, and Wee Heavy is no exception. Smooth chocolate, molasses, with a dry cherry-scotch finish--this beer is a must have.","Alabama, USA","Dr_MedievAle"
655,"2013-09-04",4.4,"An amazing wee heavy. Doesn't initially come across as a wee heavy. Big chocolate notes, a nice cherry sweetness, no smokiness like the description says. The heavy, overbearing booziness of most scotch ales is not present. The alcohol heat is barely there, perfectly masked and intertwined with the chocolate. Almost reminiscent of KBS or other dark, chocolately brews. Incredibly unique.

655,"2013-01-05",4.2,"My first introduction to the style. It prefers resting a bit after pouring. Reminds me of a tastier barley wine. Pours dark brown with a quickly disappearing head.

655,"2012-06-09",4.1,"You can see as this beer is poured into your selected glass, that it has a deep chestnut red color but the end result has a look of deeper brown. Ruby high lights pour into view along the edges. The foamy tan cap is smallish but quite dense with a long retention, leaving long lacing about the glass.

Aromatics are rich sweet malts, some roasted malts and maybe hints of burnt toffee. As the beer warms the aromas mingle nicely releasing some more flavors such as candied sugars and molasess.
Possibly some peat but that could be suggestive I think.

Very malt forwar brew here.
As the beer warms flavors come and go, there is alot going on here. At the first sip you taste the rich malts toffee and roasted malts. But as the beer warms other flavors become apparent like candied sugar, dark fruits. The end ends with warming alcohol, quite strong.

A rather thick beer with a smooth mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy as it warms further. The alcohol also become more intense as it warms.

A good beer to sip along with through the night but I do feel that the alcohol is a bit stong for me. Perhaps if this ale was toned down abit it would excel even further.","chalfontborotowntonbergville, Pennsylvania, USA","micronaut129"

A touch of chocolate and resiny hops round out the scent.  The flavors are; smokey, chocolaty, a little bit roasty, and not as sweet and candy-like as the aroma suggests.

655,"2011-11-23",4.4,"Insane scotch ale!  I havent had too many beers in this style, because I thought I wasnt all that big of a fan of them.  But this offering in the style from AleSmith blew me away!  This is one fantastic beer!  It pours a very dark brown color, actually almost black.  I noticed a bit of a purplish hue, too.  The head is small and doesnt offer much lacing, but then again, beers of this magnitude really dont.  So I wont hold too much about the head against this beer.  After a while though, if I let the beer sit for a few mintues, I did get some light cascading and lacing around the glass (although you cant really see most of it once the glass is set back down on the table).  The aromas are very inviting and complex.  The first characteristic I notice is a dark chocolate scent.  That evolved into some vanilla, bourbon, toasted bread, yeast alcohol and dark fruits.  The body is fairly heavy, but well-balanced and enjoyable.  The flavors are absoutely delicious, with notes of dark chocolate, toasted malts, alcohol, dark fruits, light hops and rye bread.  The finish is sweet, with a slight tang of alcohol and more chocolate.  This is definitely one incredible beer!","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"

Beer served in a Bruery tulip. Beer is brown and pretty hazy with a big off white head of small bubbles. Head falls away quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is high, looks good.

Mildly caramelly, mildly peaty, mildly sweet, smells good but I wanted more volume.

Beer is medium bodied and has a lot of carbonation on the palate. Its sweet up front with some caramel notes in the midpalate region and follows it up with nice malt presence and clean finish that isnt dry. Drinkability is high and I really liked this beer.

655,"2011-04-10",4.0,"Pours a very deep dark chestnut brown color with ruby/mahogany edges and a frothy two finger beige head with excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Chunks of soapy lacing left behind.

Very smokey roasted malt aroma with hints of chocolate, oatmeal, hazelnut, burnt toast and roasted espresso bean. Theres also a bit of sweet dark fruit but the nose is dominated by the roasted character.

Chewy full body with a blast of dry roasted malt up front that lingers throughout over the sweeter malt and dark fruit notes into a lingering dry finish. Slightly bitter with some earthy hops and acrid burnt toast flavor as well as hints of chocolate, hazelnut, oatmeal, toffee and coffee bean. Im picking up some licorice and dark fruit mid-palate, especially plum and raisin that provide some much needed balance to the heavy roast character. There is some slight heat and warmth in the finish but the ABV is well masked. Dry fnish.

Overall, this beer is pretty complex and flavorful but its a touch too roasted tasting for my liking. Its still a very good beer but I wish there was a bit more sweetness to balance things out.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Taste is very complex. Typical Alesmith assertiveness, heavy on the malt, toffee, chocolate, raisins, loads of oats, cinnamon, spices, tough chewy bread, barely, candi-sugar, marzepan, figs, quite unbalanced but very interesting and a little rough on the palate but generally a very fine and very nostalgic brew.

4.0 A: Very dark brown, nearly black color. Two full fingers of cream colored creamy/frothy hybrid head. Good retention and a small ring of lacing.

4.0 S: As this warms up it becomes very nice. Roasty, toasty, and some smoke are readily apparent. Somewhat grainy and a bit bready as well. Brown sugar, toffee, and a touch of booze. The aroma could be stronger though.

4.0 T: Taste is a bit better than the nose, but deserves the same score. Only a touch of roastiness, toastiness, and smoke. Dark roast crystal malt is very apparent. Some raisin/tobacco and date fruitiness in there. Brown sugar and toffee again. The alcohol is extremely well hidden.

4.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Very creamy and smooth. My only issue with the mouthfeel is that the carbonation isnt spritzy enough and the beer lies heavy on the tongue.

4.5 D: Maybe Ive been drinking too many big beers lately, but this doesnt seem as flavorful as it could be. The nose and taste are good, but could use a little extra power. Overall, this beer is pretty good and the alcohol isnt found anywhere in the taste, making this beer quite drinkable.

Tons of flavor - roasted malts up front, with sweet, velvety, smoky caramel following... balance is perfect, though, which I really love about this one - so many scotch ales are so far overboard on the sweetness, with not enough to reel them back in.

655,"2010-07-01",4.2,"750mL into my new thistle! Finally the right glass for a Scotch Ale. Poured a deep, clear, gorgeous ruby with a massive, beyond rocky, almond ice cream head that has absolutely insane retention and lacing of God. The head is so thick that I literally took a few Advil pills and could just rest them on the foam. Fucking unreal. If ever there was a beer to get a 5/5 for appearance, this is it. Nose is rich with maple syrup pancakes, cocoa butter, coconut, cinnamon toast, fresh coffee. As it warms it smells like straight up French toast. Taste is maple, brown sugar, coffee, dark chocolate, perfumey/floral hops show through, spicy alcohol (no warming though). Chewy, thick palate with spicy alcohol and balancing hops in the finish.

Also some mineral, and some almost perfumey floral thing going on. Grain and malt richness fills in the background. Pretty huge feel to the beer, but always perfectly balanced and never clumsily sweet. Just an excellent really well-made beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

655,"2010-01-25",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2011 Location: 750 ml bottle from Whole Foods - Bowery, 2/9/11


Aroma: The nose is malty sweet with caramel, roasted notes, and some dark fruits/raisins

Appearance: Its dark brown with a slight redness to it and only a tiny amount of bubbly tan head

Flavor: Fairly sweet, flavors of the nose, not as much hop presence as I noted on draft

Palate: The drinkability remains high here, it is medium-full bodied, with a soft (almost flat) carbonation

Overall Impression: 
Since I saw this one in Whole Foods a few months back, and it has now been about a year after I tried this one for the first time on draft at the brewery, I thought it might be a good time for re-rate.  Anyway, this stuff wasnt quite as spectacular as I had remembered, but it is still a really good beer.  Well average the scores together (rounding up!) to make a composite thats slightly lower then before, but still quite high. (7/4/8/4/15)



Location: On tap at the Brewery, 1/8/10 


Aroma: Rich malty nose, lots of fruit notes, caramel, toffee, and earth

Overall Impression: 
This beer is quite good.  One of the best, if not the best, Scotch Ale Ive ever had.  Really good stuff.  AleSmith does it again.  Im so glad I got to try so many beers on my visit, and I wish I could have more access to this one.  (8/4/9/4/17)","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

A very smooth and pleasant chocolate finish lingers on the palate.  As far as a Scotch Ale is concerned this absolutely nails it.

The flavor somehow improves upon the great aroma, and never lets the Scotch overwhelm notes of molasses, roasted caramel malts, chocolate, smoked wood, dark fruits (cherries, figs, plums, dates- same ones as in the nose), earthy hops, butterscotch, and soda bread.

Theres delicious malts all around in the flavor. Very complex malt profile. Some bready notes, but most of all lots of caramel. With a complementary fruitiness, that has a very gentle tart character (perhaps caused by cellaring), I get a sensation similar to hard fruit candy.

It smells like dried apricots and plums mashed up with fine rum.  The aroma is like a caramelized Belgian quad, phenols and rich malt blend with melting sugar.  Im really not a big fan of the Scotch Ale generally speaking, but this beer hits the malt flavors just right.  The malt is chewy and thick with a wonderful warming alcohol presence.

Solid black, though not quite as thick and viscous as some, a gentle head of khaki fluff floats in suspended pockmarks above the black depths below. Lace sticks like algae to the sides of my glass, even as some tempting swirls release esters of spice and wood, dark pitted fruits, more spice, and ending with rum-soaked black earth. With the first sup, the top of my tongue tingles under a bright assault of flavors which I was not expecting. She immediately leaves a dry rub of spice and wood which continues to absorb the moisture in my mouth from start to finish. Her alcohol warmth soaks my breath even as wood tannins, vanilla root, and dried black cherries melt together in the cauldron of her palate. Make no doubt though, her palate is dry, spiced, and woody with a sprinkling of dry chocolates dominating. Her sweeter, softer side smoothes the rough edges with brown sugars and warm maple, all to brings my Alesmith Wee Heavy journey to a seductively drinkable conclusion.


An intriguing and very tasty balance between dry, sweet, warm, and spiced with the rich creamy malty center that characterizes the Scottish Wee Heavy. I havent ventured into too many Wee Heavies yet, but for the time-being, the Alesmith Wee Heavy is high on the list of exquisite delicacies.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Full-bodied and creamy with a drying and mildly bitter finish. The flavor was a solid, round, sweet and lightly peaty malt with an earthy hop addition at the finish.

655,"2009-04-07",4.4,"Oh wow! 750mL into snifter. Bottle received in trade 16 months ago. I normally find scotch ales and their associated characteristics to be overpowering or unbalanced, but not at all in this wonderful creation. The balance is flawless. Aroma is of dark fruits, some slightly smoked wood, molasses, and caramel. The mouthfeel is quite nice, with good carbonation level, no cloying tendency, yet a slightly oily film coats my palate following each voluptuous encounter. The flavor is even bolder and richer than the aroma, with rich velvety chocolate joining the party. Intriguing caramelization and molasses backs up the rich chocolate melding seamlessly with the light smoke and wood flavors. The perfect level of assertiveness in the warming sensation pleasantly guides the finish, emboldening the rich chocolate, dark fruits, and smoky wooded overtones. 
This beast dries out in the finish much more than I would have assumed, which brings us from overwhelmingly, decadent liquor back into the realm of sweet quaffable goodness. Raisins, currants, and chocolate linger from start to finish of the finish. The smoked woody peat comes back in the tail end of the finish to tease the nostrils briefly before retreating into the depths.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"

Pretty darn amazing for the style.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"

Rerate moving up from 4 to...  Two year old bottle properly stored.  Less tobacco scent.  Still there, just not as prominent.  Sweet funkiness starting to show on the nose.  Bright sharp frutiness, almost cranberry.  Vanilla.  Dark brown with rust highlights.  Resilent ring and lace.  Taste is caramel and light fruit.  Light flavor of dark fruit is part of it.  Raisins, but also lighter fruit flavor.  Bitter malt finish, and even a bit of hoppiness after two years.  Gooey in the back of the throat.  Wonderful.  Wish I had 3 more in the cellar.  Im resisting going higher than 4.3, as IIm trying to not inflate.  Nose is close to 9, as is flavor.","San Diego, California, USA","Lagunitasfan"

Pours a dark red/amber color, clear and sparkling with tons of tiny bubbles.  Large, creamy beige head with great lacing that lasts to the final sip.  Aroma is moderately roasty/malty with some molasses and alcohol, caramelized fruits and a hint of spiciness as it warms.  Flavor is fantastic, and gets better as it approaches room temperature.  Sweet and malty, lots of smoke and some burnt toast on the back of the tongue, a hint of brandy at the front.  Full bodied, creamy and maybe a little bit syrupy, perfectly balanced by moderate carbonation.  Molasses from beginning to end, with some dates and a light dry bitter finish that sticks around for a while. Mmmm, it keeps getting better the more I drink.","Alta Loma, California, USA","mspindler"

655,"2008-11-28",4.4,"I cellared it for a year, and don’t know how old it was before I got it.  The flavors had meshed perfectly with age, and it was hard to pick out one flavor on its own.  Smoky butterscotch is probably what  I would say.  Couldn’t detect much of the hops, and it was less sweet than other scotch ales that I have had.  Great beer.

Fantastic mouthful, medium/full but so soft and fluffy! Great aftertaste, leaves the checks puckered in from the bitter dry woodiness.  Definitely a fan.

655,"2008-10-26",4.3,"This one pours a very dark brownish copper that is almost completely opaque in the glass.  The large tan head lingers as a cap throughout leaving sheets of lacing.

The aroma is big and complex and is dominated by the sweet, heavy caramel malts and brown sugar.  There also plenty of dark fruits, raisins especially, and a hint of booze.

The taste is just as complex as the aroma.  The malts again dominate from start to finish   There is a much bigger hop presence than the smell would suggest, some earthy hops and a bit of citrus.  Finish is a dark fruit sweetness with the hops and some toffee lingering in the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is crazy smooth, just silky.  Lots of carbonation to accentuate the medium heavy body, keeping it from getting too cloying.

This is one of, if not the best wee heavy I’ve ever tasted.  It’s big and complex, yet very drinkable.  Another great brew from AleSmith.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Great amount of smoke on the flavor, not too much. Sometimes the smoke seems contrived (on weaker Scotch Ale’s) but definitely not here.

Carbonation looks good with a small tight tan head.  Starting with a full body it goes down with a rich feel.  Finish comes in with a bold sweet malt flavor that has dried fruit flavor in it.  In the after taste as the sweetness fades out a mild bitterness can be detected.

Nice malt and body with hops still in the play despite a good deal of time for all to oxydize. That last part didn’t seem the least bit detrimental to a beer like this - very appealing and that’s saying something for a guy that tends to lean to the hoppy side a lot.

A thick tan clingy head stays put on top of this lovely brew and makes you stick your nose into it while quaffing this malty thick beer.  Nose while being malty also has whisky mash tones that make one think of the highland mountains.  (can you tell it was hitting me already and I didn’t even know it?)Body is not as full as I thought it was going to be.  It is a creamy carmel. My head is spinng halfway thru this bottle. (I am now inbetween the anvil and hammer) Light whisps and mere suggestions of hops peek at the tounge.  Lacing is uneven but pretty. (at this point my body shut itself off and forced me into nap mode).

Aroma is largely caramel and dark fruit, though I detected molasses, coffee, and slight wood characteristics as well.  I was surprised to not find any of the heavy grain characteristic so common in Scotch ales.  The flavor is an assault on your senses, with a velvety smooth texture throughout.  You get heavy malt, chocolate, and dark fruit on the front, dissolving into hop bitterness at the end.

Other aromas include vanilla, and walnut, though roasted malt is prevalent and hard hitting. Flavor Was huge of malt, hitting from every possible angle. Malt character and complexity of this nature is seldom seen, and unrivaled in my expirience. So many flavors and facets of the malt come out not only in this style, but in this particular well honed example. Palate is incredibly smooth, creamy, full, rich, viscous, with a sticky coating property and some tingling carbonation.

A finger of foamy offwhite head forms, then slowly fades over a couple of minutes, to a thin layer with some nice sticky lacing.

It is very mellow, but has a nice array of flavors.  Nuts and chocolates and some caramel.  Finishs with a little stickyness.  Medium body with some chewyness, and a sticky finish.

Taste is semi-sweet with a lot of chocolate, some alcohol, and a lot of lightly toasted malt. Good thick mouthfeel with a somewhat dry, long finish where there is a little smoke and what tastes like honey--although I assume that it is the molasses. A beer that is complex, subtle, and seamlessly crafted. Really excellent stuff, and I preferred this to the bourbon aged version.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
655,"2008-06-02",4.4,"(bottle, thanks Bartzilla!) Pours dark brown with an off-white head that retains nicely.  Aroma is initially really fruity, with some dried fruits and cherry (like red vines licorice).  Upon warming theres more malty aromas of chocolate, caramel, and further warming yields the smell of fresh baked brownies.  Agitation also reveals some toasted nut aroma as well along with vanilla.  None of these smells really dominate over the other, but they all blend together nicely.  The flavor is very sweet and malty, with prominent flavors of chocolate and caramel, but theres also a light fruitiness and hop bitterness that lurks around in the finish.  A hint of smoke is also evident as well.  Mouthfeel is medium.  This is a really solid beer, that doesnt have a stand out flavor or aroma, but everything just blends together perfectly.  This is definitely one of the best scotch ales Ive had.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Full body with medium carbonation with small bubbles.   Really good stuff.   A quite refined sipping beverage.   The balance makes it very drinkable for its strength.

Nose begins roasty and bread crust like, foollowed by deep caramel malts and subtle smokey grape notes. the first sip is rich and complex. Smooth sweet malts roll over the tongue. Hints of rum raisns in caramel sauce blend with a mild smokey wood flavor. The alcohol definately makers its presence known, slightly hot, but adds to the complexity. The mouthfeel is definately thicker, which carriers the flavors well. This is definately one of my top tens.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Davinci"

Sweet malts, toffee, caramel, some dried fruits on the nose, hints of chocolate, hints of caramelized cherries. As it warms it opens up and fruits become more pronounced. Before I get into the flavor, the body on this was just amazing. Not too heavy, even when almost at room temp didnt come close to approaching syrupy. The flavor followed the nose, a sweet caramel maltiness. Chocolate, and then dried fruit and alcohol hits the chest halfway through the glass and gently wafts up the nose. This is so complex. As it continued to warm prunes (in a really good way) became apparent. Good times, hope for (many) repeats.","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"

655,"2008-04-09",4.3,"So here it is the holy grail for maltheads like myself. 22oz bottle courtesy of my buddy from Cali. Pours a gorgeous mahogany color with a big beige head that lasts a long time. Nose is deeply rich with huge notes of chocolate and caramel and underpinings of toffee. There is also a light citrus note that must come from the hops needed to balance this monstrosity of malt. On first sip I was a little disappointed. Strong flavors of chocolate and caramel come through but pass quickly and then a nice hop bite kicks in followed by a strong alcohol burn and a lingering bready biscuityness with hints of smoke. This is much more complex than most scotch ales but I dont quite find it as enjoyable to drink. Its strange because although this will get a much higher rating from me than the Bellhaven Wee Heavy, I much prefer the Bellhaven for drinking pleasure.

655,"2008-03-21",4.1,"2007 vintage, aged at least 10 months, probably a little longer.  Pours a very dark and cloudy, melted dark chocolate color.  A small, foamy tan head leaves behind random spots and flares of lace.  Bold, agressive notes of vanilla and boozy oak hit the nose first, followed by luxurious waves of chocolate, caramel, molasses, and lightly smoked peat.  Theres a touch of saltiness to the nose, which I commonly find in Scotch Ales.  The flavor is well blended, with oak and vanilla again imparting their signature tastes to this malty brew.  Chocolate, molasses, and caramel show alot of sweetness, with a hefty dose of earthy hops attempting to balance things out.  Raisons and figs emerge, adding fruity depth and complexity.  I even picked up a touch of cinnamon.  Medium-full bodied and very smooth, the only problem I have is that the alcohol isnt as well hidden as Id like.  While smooth, it goes down hotter than expected, with the heat lingering in the back of the throat.  This is truly a great brew, with just a few minor flaws.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
655,"2008-03-21",4.0,"Thanks to Marcus for this one. Aromas of chocolate, ripe, red stone fruits, and touches of peat and malt. Strong mahogany color with tiny bubbles and a decent beige head that didnt hang around. Very smooth; full bodied; creamy, almost chewy, carbonation. Flavor is lightly smoky dark malt, with a little heat, chocolate, and something like fresh, sweet ripe red plums. Its really smooth. A little suggestive of Glazen Toren Canaster; its in that class, but I truly prefer the Belgian over the Diegan. As the malt slips away, the finish seems to have a little hop bitter. This is not sticky sweet, but it is more sweet than dry. If youre lucky the pricing might be about the same for both ales, and Id recommend the Canaster. If you cant get the Canaster, go with this one. It really is quite good.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

I dont like barley wines, I really like this.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"

I wish I would have had this for #650 instead of the Yulesmith Summer edition.  As good as that was this is probably the best beer I have tried in a while.  It seems that Alesmith has not disappointed me yet as I work my way through their star studded lineup of craft beers.  I look forward to getting another sample of the barrel aged version to see how this was affected by the aging.
Aroma / Appearance - A reddish-purple body looked nice under the moonlight.  A short lived two finger head settled and left huge thick traces down the sides of the glass.  Raspberries, chocolate truffle and thick velvet cake were so dense as to be almost suffocating.  A hint of mint teased me as the possibilities within.  It was almost as complex as some imperial stouts or huge fruit beers.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel coated the tongue and throat leaving behind a mossy taste.  Hops made an appearance but were well balanced.  The finish of dark truffles and raspberries left me wanting to go right back to the store and buy another bottle.   This was a fabulous beer that Ill have to buy again at some point.  The only thing keeping me from stocking this regularly is the price.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
655,"2007-11-28",4.1,"25.4 oz bottle, cellared 18 months.  A deep but clear blood red with edgy tan froth.  Concord grapes, peat, raisins and almond brittle.  Smells incredible.  Medium body with the barest hints of carb.  Tastes like scotch at first, then coconut milk?, vanilla and toffee.  Light drying with a tang.  Immediately soothing; a fine sipper.  Id like to try a fresh one.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

655,"2007-11-20",4.5,"Pours a gorgeous mahogany with amber highlights and a medium white head.  Aroma is magnificent- raisin, plum, clove, wine, yeast, caramel, toffee, molasses, chocolate- too many to list.  Flavor is equally exquisite: Dark fruit and spice perfectly melted with a malt backbone of smokey chocolate, molasses, and yeast.  Palate is creamy, and not at all cloying.  A must try.","Quincy, Massachusetts, USA","lordeche"
655,"2007-11-15",4.9,"The first sample was perfect. Many more bottles have met their demise in this household, but not all of them illustrated the perfection that regularly peeks out. The possibility that only very fresh bottles perfectly suit my palate arises. Analyzation aside, many of my experiences with this beer have yielded awe-inspiring, nearly tearfully joyous moments. A feeling of a slight inconsistency is the only reason this doesnt achieve perfection in scoring, even though its perfect in my mind. Any experience that was less than perfect was just barely so - this is a masterpiece, the finest beer Ive ever had in my many years of craft beer enjoyment, the single most exciting beverage thats ever crossed these lips. 
The dense pour oozes from the bottle in a honeyed formation, filling the glass with a dark, shadowy ruby pour with devilish crimson brilliance. A thick head thats creamier than cream itself forms and remains steadfast, throughout the consumption of the entire glass. The glass itself doesnt even seem to matter, this always looks great. Lacing is thick, webbed and scattered in intricate patterns rarely encountered. Perfect. 
Such rich aromas fill the air. The list is evergrowing as repeated whiffs are deemed necessary by someone who just cant get enough, someone who just cant get over how amazing this is. Peat, chocolate, vanilla, brandy, red wine, wood, hazelnuts, almonds, plums galore, caramel, butterscotch, roasted grains, fresh grass, molasses, herbs, coffee, flowers, toffee...the list goes on but I feel like its no longer a task sorting through such a numerous display of engaging nuances. Alcohol is prevalent throughout repeated inhalations but is never a deterrent or detractor from everything that captivates and satisfies. Perfect.
The first sip is better than silky, more luxurious than I can adequately describe. The body is full and robust but full of delicacy and complexity at the same time. Carbonation is low to medium and whirls the flavors around so efficiently that every tastebud has the opportunity to share in this momentous flavor. Peat and chocolate arrive first and set up a base camp at the perimeter. Smoke and caramel infiltrate the peaks and valleys. Sweetness is medium and perfectly wrought. Bitterness is low, hops are invisible. Acidity is nil, this is just too creamy. The finish is lengthy, bold and embracing; a soft glance at the preceding reveals a lingering chocolate and caramel edge with peated malt and faint fruit that fade gracefully away. Perfect.
Were this rated based upon the first bottle consumed, it likely would have been scored a perfect 5. Something so amazing warranted repeated visits nearly immediately though, and not all of those were as amazing. Not as amazing, as in 4.9 or 4.8 - this is always an amazing beer. Alesmith has not created their interpretation of a Scotch ale in the typical confines of the style, theyve reinvented and improved upon the style to such a degree that I feel like this beer will never seem tiresome. To me, that is perfect.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

I really wish that I had taken better notes on this one, because I remember that there were a lot of specific, interesting flavors, but apparently I failed to write them down. With all the other beers I tasted that night and the three intervening days, I cant remember those specific flavors, and that bugs me. Oh well.

655,"2007-06-07",4.6,"Appearance: Pouring out dark, chestnut brown with a head reminiscent of frothed milk. Alright, this starts off my inaugeral AleSmith experience! 

Smell: Stongly sweet caramel malt aroma coupled with a limitless amount of peat and smoke. Touch of oak. Some dark fruits glazed in maple syrup.

Taste: Starts off with a clean maltiness which blends effortlessly with the peat and dark fruit flavors. Again, a bit of oak in the equation. A bit like a nice tawny port. The hops, though present, are restrained and unobtrusive, allowing for the dark, wine-like fruits and sweetness to dominate (though, at no point is this beer overly sweet). A little time and warmth help to coax out some additional flavors of cocoa and toasted vanilla beans. A litte more time brings out some fusel qualities.

Mouthfeel: Medium, and so very smooth.

The aroma is slightly weak identifying the alcohol and chocolate. The taste is malty, hits chocolate to palate nearly instantly, hop is minor but present. Even though the alcohol is present in the aroma the taste is really hides that alcohol taste. Another impressive beer from Alesmith.","Norwood, Massachusetts, USA","Alldaydrinker"
655,"2007-04-18",4.2,"Smell is good Im getting hints of chocolate and some caramel. Drink4Satan pointed out cherrys but I can smell it my self. The color with light you can see through without light it appears to be brown and solid in color. Flavor was great just like the smell i get some caramel and hints of chocolate at the very end which is a great finish to the beer. I would drink this again with pleasure. Cheers and Enjoy.","Bristol, Rhode Island, USA","swedishfish"
655,"2007-04-18",4.3,"Pours a transparent black with a ruby tint. The aroma is cherry, sugar, toasted barley and chocolate. The taste is dark pitted fruit, caramel, grahm cracker, molasses and nuts, with a slight hop bitterness. In the aftertaste I detect a bit of baking cocoa. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, yet spritzy on the carbonation. The flavor has a long residence time that sticks to the top of the mouth. This is insane!","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"
655,"2007-04-18",3.6,"This beer poursa medium head and has a nice dark color to it.  It has a nice hoppy smell to it with some fruits to it. As you drink it you start out tasting some heavy carbonation and then that dies down to a nice sweet malty and fruity and hints of chocolate and coffee most likely espresso. The after taste sticks around for a bit of a while but not as long as most other beers.","Bristol, Rhode Island, USA","emerica56"
655,"2007-04-18",3.6,"taosted oats and toffee with a bit of dark fruit and sugar nose. Ever so slightly hot up front with nice release of gases.

655,"2007-04-15",2.1,"Winey smell, somewhat cherry(?) esque I think. Very dark amber. Average tan head. Too sweet, some smokeyness no hops. Average thick mouthfeel. I wasnt impressed.","Dothan, Alabama, USA","Rictus"

The flavor is burnt sugar, wood, sap, and raisin. It leaves a somewhat smokey finish with caramel and molasses sweetness. The aftertaste is quite oaky. Well-rounded roasted barley character throughout. The alcohol becomes noticeable eventually.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

655,"2007-02-24",3.3,"Enjoyed this with my friend Chris when he and his wife were over visiting.  Very fruity nose of berries, figs, raisins etc.  Brown sugar & molasses, and some burned malt and alcohol were also enjoyed.  Pours dark with garnet highlights.  The head is small and diminishing.  The front is malty and sweet.  The middle is warm and alcoholic.  The finish is malty as well but with some grainy, toasty and tangy qualities.  The full body is syrupy and soft.  The finish feels cloying.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
655,"2007-02-21",3.5,"Smells of sweet caramel, brown sugar and nuts. flavor is very well balanced with a slight roasted malt flavor as well as nuts, slight smokiness, and sweet malt. A slight Alesmith taste (maybe the yeast) in the aftertaste. Pretty good for the style, but it doesnt stand out as the best scottish ale.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
655,"2007-02-15",3.8,"Poured a dark brown with a small, wispy head; annoying bubbles clinging to the side, low in the glass within the beer itself.  Looked like coca-cola basically.  Strong aroma of toffee, rasins, dates, brown sugar, and alot of sweetness.  Flavor is more of the same, with some hoppiness, and the signature alesmith smoky finish.  Pretty good, but I was hoping for more.  Maybe this style is just not my favorite.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
655,"2007-02-11",4.2,"Pours a dark brown with little to no head.  Kind of syrupy looking.  Smells of chocolate and caramel like most scotch ales.  Taste is pretty sweet with some vanilla and caramel, with hints of chocolate, and a light spiciness to it.  Kind of tastes like a tootsie roll.  alcohol is prevalant.  Very sweet malts and roasted nuts towards the finish.  Very nicely done, probably thebest scotch ale Ive ever had.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
655,"2007-02-06",4.2,"25 oz bottle, via fordest, acquired in 2005.  Pours a dark ruby hued brown colored body under a small creamy beige head that receded to a thin ring.  A slight yeast haze.  The nose is deeply malty and sweet.  Some notes of smoke, raisins, alcohol, dark fruits, light yeast, and coffee.  Flavor is big heavy malt thats alot less sweet than I expected up front, fading to a smokey, lightly yeasty warming finish.  Great well rounded flavor, with dangerously well hidden alcohol.  Mouthfeel is just perfect.  Thick and heavy but without any cloying stickiness at all.  Great light fine carbonation.  Amazing how it can feel so soft and yet be so big.  Very very good stuff.  No one overpowering aspect.  Peter Zien... the mans an artist.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

655,"2007-01-30",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2013 The most chocolate-forward brew Ive tasted.  Pours to a burgundy/bourbon shade of dark brown topped with extra-shot latte froth.  Aromas of nougat, godiva, medium roasted coffee and cranberries.  Similarly, tastes of toffee, dense mayan chocolate and irish cream.  Whiskeyish flavors arrive eventually but not in an alcoholic kind of way, as the alcohol is almost undetectable.  Thick and sensual in the mouth but perfectly subtle.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
655,"2007-01-27",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2007 06 bottle.  Pour is a dark ruby with a nice light tan head.  Aroma of raisins, caramel, toffee, roasted malt and chocolate.

655,"2007-01-18",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2010 In short: A big and complex scotch ale with a generous hopping.  Plain and simple on of the best scotch ale available.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed when about 1 year of age
The look: Dark ruby body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention
In long: Big malty nose with caramel, maple, dark fruits and even a slight touch of smoke.  Taste has a lot going on.  Thick caramel, dried dark fruits, toffee, maple, nougat, raisins.  Hops are often hard to pick in a big sweet boozy scotch ale but here they make a big contribution.  Lots of leafy and resinous hops that provide a sticky bitterness and makes your taste buds forget that this is a very sweet beer.  Alcohol is apparent and its warmth is actually quite fitting in this beer.  Body is as full as full can be and the carbonation is very lively.  All in all the taste is very complex and the beer is surprisingly easy to drink for a big Scotch Ale.  I can drink that stuff until the Wee Heavy makes me wee-wee heavily.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering.  Best Scotch ale Ive tried.   The Commercial Description pretty much sums it up.  Very nice.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"

Vibrant aroma of rich, toasted dark fruits, caramel, toffee, and smoky herbs.. the fruit really shines at room temp & has a rum-spiked feel to it.  Smoky dark fruits, drawn, toasted caramel, and semi-sweet chocolate and molassess in the flavor department (the chocolate and molassess really rocked!).. complimentary and warm alcohol presence.. mildly bitter herbs and dark sugars at the finish.

Fantastic notes of sweet chocolate, raisins, wood and tobacco are wrapped in an ethery envelope.  Lots of sweet molasses, caramels in the body lead to a long, sweet finish.

Still great.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Whiskey, chocolate, roasted chesnuts, and malt very prominent in the nose too. Appearance was dark, but clear with hints of brown. Mouthfeel was full bodied and sticky. Flavor was much the same as the aroma but there was an earthyness present that was interesting. I can see how this is one of the top rated scotch ales around. AleSmith does it up nice on this one.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Very sweet with molasses and brown sugar, though towards the end it gets moderately bitter with some earthiness, and goes into a dry, lingering bitter finish.

655,"2006-11-10",4.5,"Pours an extremely dark amber color with almost no head.  Aroma is a meld of maltiness, spice, molasses and a hint of peat/smoke.  The mouthfeel is a nice viscous texture.  I initially thought this beer to be a bit hoppier than most Scotch Ales, but this mellowed out as the beer warmed.  Other flavors were more apparent after some warming.

Wow, full flavor maltiness from caramel, molasses, some chocolate malts and vanilla. In spite of this and the high gravity a surprising amount of piney hops remain from midway to the finish. The best Scotch Ale Ive tried to date by a wide margin. I thought Id had a couple of really good ones too. I really like Pikes Kilt Lifter on tap and the Wee Heavy blow it away.

Its mildly chocolatey, smoky, and has pronounced vanilla scents. The flavor profile is well done filled with charred oak, tame vanilla, hints of pork chop drippings. The mouthfeel is just average, but the alcohol is decently hidden or perhaps simply blends so well with the rest. This started off on a very, very strong note, but became just a bit less exciting as I adjusted to the ""just kind of big"" flavor.

Low carboantion and medium/full body with a faint oiliness lead to a rich and satisfying mouthfeel. Dark fruit, roasted grain, brown sugar, and caramel dominate the flavor, although some bitterness comes in at the end to dry it up a bit.

Rich, assertive aromas of dark chocolate covered cherries, butterscotch, caramel apples, molasses and smokey charred wood and alcohol fill the nose.  Just a fantastic aroma profile! Moutfeel was fairly full, round amd smooth with just the perfect amount of carbonaton.  Superb flavors of dark roasted malt, burnt caramel candies, dark chocolate, molasses, licorice and charred wood. The only slight flaw I would mention was the late palate and finish was a tad harsh and boozy with the alcohol pushing its way to the forefront a bit too much. Not well hidden at all. Definitely a great winter fireplace ale after a year or two of ageing.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

655,"2006-08-09",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2006 Tasted with OhioGuzzler...  Dark brown, pretty clear.  No head.  Smells a lot like bourbon from a charred oak barrel.  Sweet malt, subtle roastiness, and some alcohol bite.  No smoke flavor or other complexities.

655,"2006-08-06",4.6,"This is a very distinctive and complex beer.  Pours a transparent dark chestnut color.  The aroma makes you imagine you are in the Highlands of Scotland.

A much needed rerate.  Ive tried to do so a few times but havent managed.  Pours dark brown amber with a 1 finger head.  The nose is incredible malty sweet, and robust.  Taste is sweet malty and robust, it is really a pretty damn amazing beer, this is beer that really got me going and I still like it.  And Im out it tonight.  I like it still is it a 5?  Its damn close if anything.  


This is my favorite beer, I love everything about it, it is unique, extremely malty, with rich sweet flavor.  This beer is perfect for all  seasons, like other fantastic beers from Alesmith, the alcohol taste is hidden behind the complex and enticing flavors.  I cant say a single bad thing about this liquid art form, thanks Alesmith.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

Its a perfect day for an IPA, and this bottle should be aged for a couple more years, but what the hell - Im not going to encourage him to save the bottle for later. This is a big beer, the aroma starts with my glass still at arms length. Pours a nearly opaque reddish brown with a rocky tan head. The aroma is tootsie rolls, roasty chocolate and prunes.

655,"2006-07-16",3.4,"A couple of things to say here before the rating. This is the last of the ""accessible"" Alesmiths (those with a ton of ratings to try anyway, theyre not really all that accessible!) I have yet to rate.  I owe 100% of the chances to try them to Hogtown Harry and Blankboy, two great ratebeerians and friends who have been very generous with sharing the fruits of their very active trading.  These guys are big credits to this site and awesome guys to share a brew with!  And second, Im not sure any American Micro has consistently blown me away across their entire lineup.  There is so much good stuff going on in the U.S right now with micros that I encourage people to step back a bit and appreciate what they have - these threads discussing how just about every good beer I have ever tried is a bit ridiculous. Anyway, here goes.  Bottle shared with Hogtown Harry, GregClow, Jerc, and Blankboy, courtesy of blankboy.  Sweet malt, alcohol, in very muted aroma.  Dark brown, syrupy looking, not really any head.  Strong alcohol and malt taste - not much else.  Very little hops, all alcohol.  Wheres the smoke?  The earthiness?  The complexity of a fine Scotch Ale?  Maybe this is a very young bottle?  I was not expecting something so one dimensional from Alesmith.  I enjoyed drinking it, but in comparison to their other offerings, and given my expectations for what they could do with this style, this is a big letdown.  I look forward to revisiting in the future.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
655,"2006-07-16",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2007 750. Huge, creamy, chewy, delicious beer. Pours opaque brown with a beautiful sudsy tan head. As usual, AleSmiths tasting notes dont steer you wrong; sweet malt, smoke, toffee and raisins on the nose, with chocolate, molasses, and smoke on the palate. The body is impeccably modulated, just showing real girth but not collapsing into syrup. Theres enough carb there to keep it something like refreshing--as refreshing as sips can be, anyway. Tons of flavor, completely satisfying.
These notes apply to an 07, which gets a 6-4-6-4-12. 750, capped, thanks, Kim! Mild sweet caramel and CO2 nose. Dark brown body with amber highlights; thick foamy tan head. Light caramel and toast on the mid-palate. Clean light malt sugary finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

655,"2006-07-13",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2008 Bottle (750ml).  Shared with blankboy, GregClow, jerc and tupalev, blankboys bottle.  Poured murky brown with a small foamy head.  Boozy, sweet roast aroma with some fruity/spicy/yeasty character, but the aroma was quite muted, even after warming.  Taste of dusty toasted malt, booze, with light spice and yeast and only a hint of peaty earthiness in the alcohol-bitter finish.  Slight weak-bodied, and only lightly carbonated, the primary character of this one seemed to be ""booze"" - its nice, but the bar is set very high for me with Alesmith and this one didnt meet my over-amped expectations;  but its a high-ABV beer, and Ive been told by experienced Alesmith fans that this one needs to be aged at least 2 years, so I will put away the 3 bottles that are en-route to me right now and revisit this in 2008.  Original rating 6+3+7+4+15 = 3.5  *** Re-rate Feb 6/08 with garthicus.

655,"2006-07-13",3.6,"Brought back recently by Noah from Jungle Jims in Cincy. Ive been looking to try this for a long time. Sadly, it (or perhaps my bottle) didnt live up to the hype. I was expecting viscous, and it came off a bit thin. Theres honey and brown sugar to mesh with oak and dark fruit. Is it the best scotch ale out there? Again, perhaps I had an off bottle, but I recall being blown away by Town Halls Wee Heavy back in February of 2004, and I was expecting similar things here. The depth of flavor wasnt the same, nor was the finish. Its solid, just not overwhelming.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
655,"2006-07-06",4.8,"This scotch ale is awesome. The Wee Heavy had many of the same aroma and flavor characteristics that the Speedway Stout has. They are not the same by any stretch, but you can definitely taste the similarities. The pour was a dark reddish brown with a huge head that stuck around for a long time. The aroma was of sweet chocolate malt, and a faint hint of coffee. There is a good smoky characteristic to the nose as well. The taste is very smooth and malty, with little in the hop department. The flavors are sweet malts, chocolate, and the coffee again. Way too easy to drink for a 10% ABV beer. The best scotch ale out there for sure.""","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

The flavor also holds a more semi-sweet chocolate, some light smokiness, more sweet malt, and dark fruits...very sweet and savory. Rich over the tounge with a bit of carbonation...a bit flat at times leading to a excellentsmokey/sweet finish with just a touch of coffee like bitterness. This is one big malty beer, although I cant but to yearn for a bit more smoke/peat in here, but its still delicious despite that factor.

Finished slightly smokey (thumbs up) with sweet caramel  and hops. (fresh from the brewery i gave it a 4.3)

Retasted and rerated from bottle: Now its double a beer and half a wiskey!... The alcohol overwhelmed in the bottled version, and the sweet malts were much more noticeable with less complexity in flavors. I guess it doesnt age well.. especially in GREEN glass bottles.","tijuana, MEXICO","alafito"

Rerate:

Dark reddish brown pour with a fine beige/tan head.  Alcohol right up front in the aroma - raisins, vanilla, nutmeg, caramel malt, resiny/floral hops.  Smells like a ginger snap cookie.

Leaving the ratings the same, per fresh bottles, but there is no excuse for beer gone this bad!

The flavor was much the same, some faint peat smoke in the flavor along with a light presence of dark fruits. Mouthfeel was smooth. Within style, Im not convinced this beats out Bellhaven anymore, but it was nice. The smoke is so faint, that this comes off more like a doppelbock than a scottish ale, imo. Original rating: This beats out the Bellhaven in my book. Poured a nice dark brown with reddish-mahoganey tints and hues. The aroma was the most complex Ive ever whiffed within the style. Lots of liquor type aromas mixed in with coffee (Kahlua-like) and some dark fruit type scents. Flavor is much the same with a thin mouthfeel and a definite alcohol presence. A vinous aftertaste, this one was good stuff. A tingling of hops in the finish.","","User37895"

Im not getting any of that alcohol that others found, but I havent tasted alcohol in anything for a while now.

Verrrrry vinous flavor, lots of sweet dark fruits and some wood. Sweet finish with warming alcohol and some bitterness on the back end. Moderate, velvety-syrupy palate with a nice alcohol tingle.

Malt man malt man thick and sticky malt man. A sweet old fellow. Caramel, roasted coffee bean, cocoa, plum, and cherry flavors persist to the finish riding alongside a barrel full-o-hops.

655,"2006-02-12",4.3,"Im really becoming a fan of these scotch/scottish ales. This one poured with only a small hint of a head with only a tad bit of lacing cliniging to the sides of the glass. The nose has a mess of chocolate with some other sweet notes and an obvious finish of roasty/smokey meatyness. This palate on this is oh so smooth and silky. Very sweet and thick it is almost cnady-like. Lots of sweet matly flavours that provide tastes of rich chocolate and toffee or caramel. There is a fantastic finish of light smoke that drys only slightly. Very well done, Alesmith.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

Alcohol completely hidden except for thoughts of something far stronger than beer... at close to 10% hidding the alcohol could be dangerous. I really do like this beer, but I dont want the rating to get out of alignment with other beers I have also really liked.

Aroma is laden with rich complexities.  Peat, nearly bourbon, chocolate, pecans and liquefied brown sugar.  Vivacious indeed.  Additional wafts reveal hints of natural vanilla extract, toffee, woodsy elements and hazelnut truffles.  Flavor?  Absolutely.  Creamy, sullen smoothness settles in with a nutty chocolate sense, with the key contributors being dry milk chocolate, honey roasted pecans and caramel-laden, buttery praline cloisters.  Further flavor revelations play a romantic rendition of walnut furniture that has been brazen by candle flame, which once served as mood lighting for the evening.  Tingly, warming butterscotch character sonorously echoes like hot buttered rum.  Thick, palatable, and an overall oozing wonder on the palate.  Perfectly balanced, with a chewy malt composure and the finest levels of carbonation known to craft brewing.  Finishes with chocolate covered caramelized pecans and a touch of peat.

The color surprised me a lot as it was deep and dark, not like a porter, but with a dark golden brown.  The head looks like I may be able to stand on it, at least for a few seconds before I would sink into the greatest death anyone could dream of, drowning in a perfect blend of caramel malt, a little smoke, and superb use of hops.  Nose is sweet and smoky, with a touch of alcohol there to let you know that you arent messing with a baby brew here, it is all barley.  Sweetness abounds with the smoke and slight bitterness of the roasted caramel and hops.  Nice, full body with a stickiness and smoothness that arent found in many brews.  I loved it.

Aroma is strikingly deep and rich, with sherry and raisins, rounded with frothed whipping creme touched with a half a vanilla bean and a cup of baking sugar. A gentle rounded bourbon warms the background of the aroma. Flavor is rich complex malt, mixed with a creme brulee topped with some shaved dark chocolate. A hint of grain and oats, and a quick waft of earthy fruit. Palate is clean and a touch dry, but leaves a cloying brown sugar coating and a smack of light euro hops. An extremely well balanced beer, with deft flavors and gentle tones. Alcohol is a tinge hot.

RERATE Silver foil on the 750ml. This bottle has been open for a few hours and is probably @ 73°, which is the ambient temp in my basement today. The first 4/5th of the bottle was very enjoyable.

This is the first beer for which I ever traded.  Not sure of the vintage, but I believe its at least a year old.   Poured dark brown with ruby highlites with a small creamy light-tan head.  Aroma of alcohol, caramel, cherries, wood.  Interestingly, this is the first scotch ale Ive had that has a nose somewhat reminiscent of scotch.  Taste is mildy sweet caramel, molasses, touch of piney hops... has a dry evanescent whiskey character, which, according to the bottle, is to be expected of an older vintage.

Rich malt flavor, moderate smokiness, some plum and date fruitiness - but lots of chewy malts. Alight alcohol presence. Theres almost a Belgian quad complexity underneath everything else that remins me of a Rochefort 10 with richer malts.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
655,"2005-06-23",4.1,"Whoa - - - This is a BIG load of malt to chew!  The body is a dark nutty brown with ruby highlighting.  The head is a mere tan film.  The slightly smokey aroma is that of rich roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, toffee, raisins... all with a strong alcohol presence.  This is chewy, thick, and hot in the mouth.  The taste blends flavors of butterscotch, chocolate, roasted barley, caramel, molasses, and dried fruits.  Stir it all up, pump in some alcohol and smoke for the finish, and you have one serious Wee Heavy.  I need to get ahold of more of this for cellaring... and drinking, of course.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
655,"2005-06-20",4.2,"750 ml bottle.  Great stuff.  Poured dark brown with very little head, and consequently very little lacing.  Aromas of caramel, molassas, and other malts.

655,"2005-06-07",4.6,"Initial sample was at the brewery, notes and rating from bottle.  Poured a ruby brown, with a nice light tan head slowly rising from the depths.  Amazing aroma, with molasses, plums, smoke, alcohol, and dark chocolate, all in balance with each other.  Could sniff this one all night (and did, considering it took me almost 5 hours to finish the bottle).  Flavors were mostly centered around chocolate and a bit of smokiness, with faint plum in the background, and an alcohol finish.  Not as complex and enticing as the aroma, but excellent nonetheless.  Overt presence of alcohol on the finish keeps this one from being rated even higher.  I dont mind alcohol notes, but I felt that in this case it somewhat masked other, more interesting flavors.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
655,"2005-05-28",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2008 Nice thick, light tan head of fine dense bubbles.  Settles slowly and very nicely.  Light carbonation.  Awesome rich aroma.  Caramel, prunes, peat, raisins and a load of malt.  My goodness there is a lot of stuff in there.  Color is a very dark mahagony brown.  Big alcohol punch.  Loaded with plenty of chewy malts, peat and smoke.  Just the way a great scotch ale should be.  Some vinuous and oak notes in there also.  Flavors become more complex as the brew warms.  And warms it does, way down inside from the generous alcohol content.  Finish is creamy and slightly smokey.  A wonderful scotch ale and one that should be savored.  Thanks TAR!  A great big thanks to TAR for this gem amongst gems.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"
655,"2005-05-07",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2006 Tried this in a small tasting glass at Cleveland Ale Fest (5/05).  The lady who poured this did not know a thing about what she was doing.  Consequently my pour was quite chunky with sediment.  It was also dark brown.  The aroma was difficult to place in a shot glass sized taster but I noted a crisply sweet scent.  The flavor was most agreeable.  Smoky malt sweetness.  Wood and caramel, chocolate, and pine hops creeping in at the end.  Very unique and flavorful, nothing like I expected (dont usually like Scottish ale).  The brew also had a medium body with some slickness to it.  Dry finish marked by hops.  Ill re-rate this someday when I get a bottle for my self.  
Tried a bottle for myself the other night.  I was surprised to see that my initial rating was fairly acurate.  Noted additional caramel and smokey aroma.  Flavor notes this time included malty, minerals, marshmallows, caramel and smoke.  Creamy but watery body.  Ive adjusted my score up a bit.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
655,"2005-05-07",4.2,"Reviewed from a 2003 750ml bottle. This appears a black color till held up to the light and dark cherry highlights could be seen. A fluffy beige head sits atop the dark body that leaves minimal lace as this was consumed. Fruits scents will the aroma along with slight caramel malt sweetness. There is also a slight smoky note I am picking up from time to time. The flavor has a strong molasses taste with malty sweetness and the alcohol is definitely present. There were notes of chocolate and caramel and it ended with a slight alcohol after taste. Body was almost full with a sticky coating mouthfeel. I had no trouble finishing this big bottle and I would have had more if it were available. A very good example of the style that is worth a shot for sure.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"

655,"2005-04-26",4.2,"Many thanks to my super-hot girlfriend for this one!  750mL, purchased in December 2004, 5 months ago.  Stored in 1st floor closet.  Pours a quite dark brown with a small, creamy head; appears syrupy upon pouring.  Initial impression of aroma is too highly alcoholic; letting it breathe a few minutes helps but it is still too heavy on the alcohol; at room temperature after sitting for an hour, the truly wonderful aroma finally begins to eminate: incredibly lush aroma of malts, caramel, oranges, flowers, brown sugar, alcohol, and cookies.  Flavor begins to open up at room temperature; up front, there is an alcohol burn throughout this that I love, but it is a little bit overpowering compared to the rest of the flavors; very malty with lots of dark fruit; alcohol throughout; bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is thick and slightly sugary syrupy; nice and chewy but a little too sticky.  Overall, excellent beer.  It seems Alesmith can do no wrong.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

Aroma of malt, almonds, walnuts, corn flakes, cognac, cabernet, some chocoff.  Wonderful, complex aroma.  Tastes malty, with a huge chocolate-hazelnut palate, combined with some spirits (cognac, Amaretto).  Super smooth, and more chocolate and nuts as it warms.  Like drinking a Godiva chocolate nut candy.  The alcohol is non-existent.  The palate is more exquisite than a shaved call girl on the tongue.

Theres also smoke, peat caramel and a woody edge - almost reminiscent of an old ale, although the sweetish finish puts an end to that comparison - in the mix. What I did appreciate was the subtle, but significant, hop presence that provided a good balance to the malts and produced a smooth and dangerously drinkable ale. Not cloying at all. Good stuff. Bottled at DC gathering. 2001 version (I think).","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

The malts provide the beer with a subtle smokiness in the backround and notes of wood, prunes, raisins, toffee, grape, chocolate and caramel. Obviously this beer is more malt accentuated but the hop bitterness is this on the finish.

655,"2004-09-30",3.5,"OK... this is the third alesmith I have tried.  I am still not understanding the HUGE ratings given to these beers.  Not a single one of them hid the alcohol.  Over 8 percent for each one, and each one had an alcohol burn.  The pour was beautiful with an attractive head.  The smell was sweet and syrupy.  Carmel and raisins.  Plenty of malt and sweet aroma.  The flavor would have been great as well if it wasnt overshadowed by the alcohol.  I LOVED the 11% Stone Russian Imperial Stout.  It had way more alcohol and was able to hide it better than anything I have tried yet from Alesmith.  I am gonna keep trying till I find one I like.  I still have a bottle of speedway.

655,"2004-08-20",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2005 8/20/04.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, obtained as a birthday gift 8/14/04.  2004 Vintage.  Pours a deep burgundy brown with slight, creamy head and very nice, tightly dusty and a bit bumpy lacing.  Very dark, and it looks pretty dead sexy.  Aroma is quite nice-- plums and sort of a candy grape scent, a touch of peppery heat and dark malt.  I wish it were a little darker and more sinful.  Perhaps too much sweetness.  Initial taste brings on a bit of that sinfullness-- some dark bready cake and bitterness, still a sweet grapey and pruney taste.  Very inviting, but I dont really like the oversweet hints.  Also a bit too much alcohol in the back-- not that its overwhelming, but just that its not masked all that well.  Some thin, twiggy hops as well.  I think itll be better when it mellows out a bit.  Mouthfeel is velvety full.  Quite nice, with somewhat of a glowing carbonation hum and a bit of a dry edge.  The finish is dry and subtle, respectably long.  But it doesnt wow with overwhelming richness-- just a very mild, faint, lingering presence of smoke, phantom sweetness, and dark pruney pepper.  Very sticky on the lips.  Very drinkable and subtle.  Perhaps a bit too subtle at times, but I bet this would be a good beer to convert some macro swillers without destroying their minds with concentrated bliss.  Theyd probably think its the best thing theyve ever had in their damn life.  And theyd probably be right.  Peasants. . .  Pretty good, nevertheless.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

You can feel it in your bones that this is a scotch ale, caramel and toffee in abundance. Almost smoky at times. Close to flowery hops. Terrific blending and mutual flavor completion. Just a light alcohol hint in mid-mouth. In mouth, simply put, the beer tastes good. It has everything you wish your scotch ale to have while never being too sweet thanks to a generous (but restrained) hop profile, somehow grassy. Hints of candy, cream, coffee, chocolate. Fantastic creamy mouthfeel, rocking smoothness, this is an easy 5 for texture with so soft carbonation... Awesome, even with just a few months of age. Cheers rodolito! </br> Resample: Same 2004 vintage, but wondering if it's the same batch.

There are some nice fruity unexpected notes, as well as a hint of alcohol in the nose.  The taste is thickish, malty, and creamy.  This beer has a nice body to it.  There are some deep caramelized malt flavors accompanied by a fruitiness that is reminiscent of figs and raisins.  This is pretty well integrated.  Perhaps there is a bit of astringent alcohol in the finish, but you really can't complain much given the wonderful malt complexity and hint of roast character that is found in this beer.  This is a great beer that is smooth and calming on this cold (at least for AZ) rainy night.If I were to think about how highly touted this beer was I might be a bit disappointed, but this is just too enjoyable right now to even think of that.  This beer is all about the malt, quite refreshing from a premium American brewery.  With AleSmith's wonderful ESB, it gives me faith that the over-hopping of America is not necessarily a way of life.  Some bastions of reasonability and malt still stand.

Bottle at home.  I like this bottle somewhat better than the one before.  This bottle formed a small brown colored frothy head of fine to medium sized mostly diminishing bubbles that left behind a very good lacing and a nearly opaque dark ruby red brown colored body.  The aroma was vinous with dark malt and port-like qualities with cherry wood and caramel notes.  The mouth feel was tingly initially with a slight alcohol burn in the finish that soon mellowed.  The flavor contained notes of dark malts port vinous malts and was rich and sweet with smoky mild roasty notes.  It was rather yummy with a nice alcohol note to it.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

655,"2002-09-10",4.2,"Aroma has some surprising complexity.   Some toffee, apple butter and faint hop spiciness, with a barest hint of alcohol.  Color is dark red-amber with a well-formed and lasting head.  A very small, sparkly amount of effervescence adds to this beers overall attractiveness.  Flavor profile is also very malty, with some caramel and toffee and a lightly roasty smokiness.  A certain degree of sweetness exists throughout, but is tempered nicely by some spicy hop flavors.  Body is on the heavy side of medium, with a satisfyingly long finish.  Aftertaste has just a little alcohol as well, and overall I didnt find its presence to be imposing or inappropriate.  This beer, for being as big as it is, does possess a respectable amount of subtlety, I almost find myself groping for an apt description.  Certainly my new favorite American version of this style.  Scottish Ale as a style is underappreciated at times, I think.  Not this one, though!  Thank you so much, herb.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
655,"2002-09-04",4.1,"Big, thick, rich Scotch ale, about the best American interpretation yet.  ALMOST up there with MacAndrews and Traquair House, but not quite.  It misses the mark on the rough finish.  But still a very enjoyable ale.  Thanks again to herbjones!","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
655,"2002-08-25",3.5,"One of the prettiest beers Ive ever witnessed. Excellent aroma, great initial flavor. The only thing I took issue with was the overpowering aftertaste of raw alcohol. The smoothness ends there, and hurts what could be a near perfect beer. 
Pants off to this brew, but it could be better.","Paris, FRANCE","Dionysian"
655,"2002-08-25",4.1,"Very malty for sure, with a spicy alcohol finish.  The intitial flavor is complex but fades very quickly into the alcohol.  All things said, its a really good beer.","Tustin, California, USA","Aesir"
655,"2002-08-20",3.8,"Beautiful beer.  I love to look at it.  the aroma is malty with hints of smoke and alcohol.  the flavor follows the same profile.  the alcohol gives it quite a tangy bite on the tongue.  One bottle needs to be shared by several people because one glass is all that i can handle even though i like it so much.","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"
655,"2002-08-19",4.4,"Oh yeah baby! Vintage 2001. Chestnut brown body with a thin, clear miniscus that began as a dense tan head. Very malty and nutty aromas abound. Started out a tad medicinal from the alcohol but settles into flavors of prunes, nuts and creamy chocolate. A mild bitterness hovers throughout a beer that leaves you with a tear in your eye and only wanting more. Thanks to Gusler for providing me with this gem.","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"
655,"2002-08-09",4.1,"thick, with beautiful carmel/toffee flavors and a pleasant note of alcohol at the end.  one of the better beers to come out of san diego","san diego, California, USA","CE619"
655,"2002-07-30",3.9,"Sweet, dark, coffeeish and VERY malty!  Quite a complex brew to ponder on a snowy night in Scotland over a rack of lamb dinner.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
655,"2002-07-24",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2004 Rerate- 4-9-04-
I don't know if I didn't like scotch ales before, or if the 2004 version is a different recipe, but this beer is awesome.  Pours a deep brown with a wonderful off-white head and beautiful lacing.   Smooth with a nice smokiness like a good scotch.  I may have to age one to see how well it ages.  Too bad alesmith doesn't oak age some of this beer.

Probably my least favorite Alesmith brew so far.  Not a brew I will get again, yet it something that needs to be tried once.  Their are more flavors of Caramel and alcohol than chocolate and molasses.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
655,"2002-07-18",3.8,"Dark reddish brown w/ a tan head. Sweet w/ tastes of carmel & dried fruit. Lots of malty taste. But a touch too sweet for me. Very good, but not great.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
655,"2002-06-25",4.4,"Deep copper color with red/ruby hues. Nice head and sticky lace. Thick sweet malty nose, caramel and touches of smokey peat. Thick, smooth,soft, chewy body with perfect carbonaton. Palate is chewy malts, caramel,toffee and a touch of peaty smoke that intensifies as the beer warms. Nice earthy hop finish to balance the sweetness of the malt. This badboy is world class. For some the sweetness may be fatiging but I cant find much wrong with it. Its rich, full in flavor and a joy to sip. Alcohol is masked very nicely as well. This should be the standard for Scottish Ales IMHO. Enjoy gentleman. Thank you Gusler. Havent had a bad Alesmith yet.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
655,"2002-06-22",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2004 The beer disgorges from the 750ml green bottle a limpid deep ruby to almost brown color; the head is gargantuan in size, semi-creamy in texture and a toothsome light tan in color with the residual lace a velvet curtain to drape the glass. Nose is sweet malt, caramel and molasses, fresh and crisp, a pleasant sniff to be sure, start is demonstrative in its sweetness, thick malt presence, and the top is moderate to full in its feel to the palate. Finish has a fairish acidity, the hops relatively benign in their spiciness, the aftertaste droughty and a definite alcohol bitterness forms as the beer warms to the glass and room and it sticks to the palate till the very end. Alesmith has been since I sampled my first beer from them several years ago a favorite and I look forward to their vintages each year and keep a ton in my stash","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
655,"2002-06-20",4.7,"AleSmith has quickly become one of my favorite brewerys.Had this one on tap and it was pretty near perfection to me.Im not very good at the flowery descriptions so just try it.$10.00 a bottle and worth every penny.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
655,"2002-05-20",4.7,"Chestnut brown. Huge amount of malt. Chewy and vivuous. Oak and toffee flavour, slightly salty finish. Very complex. Definitely world class!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
655,"2002-04-21",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2007 Rerate: Newer bottles just dont have the peaty, earthy depth, and are more sweet than the 2001 bottles. Original: Rerate 2001 bottle, shared with Hey_K and Frank - yes, deeply malty and with very handleable diacetyl, not too much alcohol in nose or flavor, intensely woody, but not sharp like oak, more mapley - delicious. Up from 4.2 to much more. Stored with great care for 2 years. Original: 4/21/02 - 2000 Bottle: Top notch. Rich maltiness, deep, chewy is absolutely right. Like Im climbing Ben freakin Nevis.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

5/6/03  2001 Vintage:  Pours a dark amber-brown. Head is medium and tan. Light sweet aroma. Sweet complex flavors: Raisins and dates, caramel, a hint of cocoa, a hint of hops and smoke. Damn this is good!","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
