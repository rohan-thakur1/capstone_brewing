Thanks, Chris!

Had two tasters of this at The Bruery Society Kickoff Party on Jan. 7, 2017. It was my favorite out of the ~20 beers I tried. Excited when I walked into my office one day and this was waiting for me. Thanks so much, Chris! Gave it a 4.75 (out of 5) on Untapped at the time and I expect this to be around that once again.

Poured a black color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy tan head, which thinned out rather quickly. Serene setting underneath. Very good spotty lacing. World-class retention. (Sight - 4.25)

First sniff brought me back to that glorious day of The Bruery greatness. Got rich coffee malts, smooth oaky bourbon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, cocoa, dark chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate morsels, hints of black cherry, semi-char wood, chocolate syrup, milk chocolate, gooey fudge and some earthy leather. (Smell - 4.75)

Taste might have even been better than the nose. Wow. This once again brings me back. Got sticky milk chocolate, smooth oaky bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee, cocoa, cinnamon, coconut flakes, semi-sweet chocolate morsels, hints of tart cherry, chocolate syrup and gooey sugary fudge. Incredible. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 5.00)

Whoa. Maybe even better than I remember. Definitely in my Mount Rushmore of beers. (Overall - 4.75)

1497,"2017-03-16",4.3,"March 16, 2017 - bottle from my membership enjoying while watching opening day of March Madness. Black pour with nice amount of head that lasted a little bit and left quite a bit of bubbles at the edges. Aroma was all about the delicious coffee with some vanilla and mild bourbon/wood. Taste was a nice rich coffee, light roast, vanilla sweetness, mild bourbon and very minor touch of tart cherry. Really enjoyed this, glad I got an extra bottle, wish I had some more though.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
