Aroma has the familiar pilsner notes of grassy, noble hops with a hint of biscuit. On the palate this strikes you as a very sessionable beer, clean and very well balanced. The hops here are liquid grass - not intimidating to the novice beer drinker at all - yet quite complimentary to the light biscuit malt Â’backboneÂ’. The carbonation is perhaps a little soft compared to many other pilseners but I actually find this allows you to dwell on the other characteristics of the beer better. The body is light and the flavour is well balanced and loyal to the pilsener tradition. I donÂ’t get any barrrel notes from this one, which I wouldnÂ’t expect either but considering that the description says itÂ’s aged in barrels itÂ’s worthwhile checking for. Nicely lingering finish remniscient of the well balanced flavour.","DENMARK","humlelala"
