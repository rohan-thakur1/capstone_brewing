2968,"2016-07-19",2.9,"Not hateful! Alcohol shows a little in this, but the light to moderate grainy sweetness cuts it ok. Not something Ill go back to, but definitely enjoyed for the style.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2968,"2016-01-08",3.3,"An amber color with malt heavy aroma. This is actually decent. Have some malt and sweetness and you can kind of tell the alcohol content but its not too aggressive.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
2968,"2015-07-15",3.1,"Where and how:  b.355ml 
Aroma malty front. There is something from old 40 oz in there. Sweet pale malt, even touch of hops. Alcohol impressively well hidden.
 Appearance : 
Top: short lived lighter top. 
Base: clear amber.
Palate :  rather flat with thinner body.
Taste: lacking sticky corn feel of some Malts yet oily, slick enough for style. Slight hint of hop as in aroma. Very late roughness noted as it warms up.
 other notes  for this style this is world class","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
2968,"2015-01-03",2.8,"sweet aroma, a little syrupy, reminds me of something i cant quite put my finger on. Taste is lighter and sweeter than i expected. Almost like a sweet version of a malt liquor, the sweetness gets rid of the usual rusty can taste of most of the malt liquors ive been lucky enough to partake in.","Wisconsin, USA","MarinEvelyn"
2968,"2015-01-03",3.2,"Unclear amber with a pretty decent white head. Aroma is sugary and fruity. Lots if pear. Apple juice. Honey. Flavor is different. Kinda odd. Still fruity, but a lot more grain. Honey. Apple juice. Alcohol hidden well. Good drinkability. Not at all unpleasant at least. Nice malt liquor.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
2968,"2014-07-11",2.6,"In my opinion, craft malt liquors arent but this is kind of close to what this style is typically like when made by the macros but maybe more along the lines of the 6% ones than the 8% that this is. It pours a nice orange color w/ a fine-bubbled but relatively short lived head of fine bubbles. It is bland but does have some actual malt character in the nose--kinda bready and raisiny--which is divergent from the style but, whatever, the style is malt liquor. Taste is a bit sweet but its cut by somewhat vigorous carbonation which helps but it is still a bit heavy and sticky, especially as you dig into the glass. The predominant flavor is nutty, maybe slightly oxidized malt and maybe a bit of corn around the edges. It finishes relatively clean w/ just a hint of nondescript bitterness. I kind of like the attitude behind this beer, just trying to have some fun w/ a bad style. Id probably bring this to parties from time to time if I lived in Lake Havasu. It is not exactly a world class lager though.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2968,"2014-06-21",3.2,"Bouteille de Ibrew2or3, cheers Dave!
De couleur ambrée, col crémeux léger.
Arôme est malté, sur pointe de caramel avec une petite douceur arrivant en rétro-nasal.
Palais offre une belle effervescence, malt cara pâle, houblonné noble sur une note herbacée. Pointe de grillé rappelant un peu le Speculoos. Petite amertume discrète arrive en fin de bouche avec un fruité modéré rappelant un peu le raisin sec. Brève amertume avec un côté pomme léger.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

2968,"2013-11-16",2.6,"Thanks to Homer321 for the share. Pours a lightly hazy golden color. Toasty, caramel aroma...no notable corn. Sweet, toasty, bready, lightly spicy, caramel flavor. Very different from most likkas.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","DrewFace"
2968,"2013-11-16",2.8,"Bottle. Nose of not-corn things. Slightly bready. Flavor is slightly sweet. No hop bitterness. No hop flavor. Just kinda bland. Not true malt liquor character, good or bad. Definitely not a malt likka.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
2968,"2013-10-19",2.6,"Multiple pours of this grape drank at GABF. Pour is clear yellow with a frothy white head. Big corny, husky, grainy, cereal, and grapey aroma. Taste is big sweet corn, malty, grainy, straw, husky and sweet hops. Light body with high carbonation. Pretty nice grape drank that will get you to high boost in no time.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
2968,"2013-09-24",3.1,"Bottle from Total Wine Glendale. pours golden with a thin white head. leaves a lot of sticky lacing in the glass. slightly sweet on the nose. Tastes like corn. Finishes clean and hides the liquor well. A decent tasting malt liquor seems to defeat the purpose of the style.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
2968,"2013-09-16",2.8,"Bottle thanks to adnielsen. Pees a clear good color. Aroma is vaguely fruity, pretty mellow. Flavor is malty and mostly tasteless, but a bit butter at the end.really nice for style","Colorado, USA","gmellison"
2968,"2013-09-16",2.0,"Bottle @ home, thanks to Ibrew2or3. Thanks Dave! Pours a hazy dark golden appearance with an off white head. Creamed corn, plastic, cabbage, cat litter, paper aroma. Tangy, sightly metallic, chewy grainy, candy corn, minimal grape drank, sweet flavor. Not my favorite but god damn, I love seeing craft malt likkas, bro.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
2968,"2013-07-09",2.6,"Thanks to Dave for sending this my way. Clear golden pour with a white head. Smells like lemon, plastic, and sweet malt. Apple juice, sugar, and some booze. The flavor is sweet and a bit boozy. Apple juice, malt, sugar, and some fruit. A touch of lemon, plastic, and rubber.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2968,"2013-06-30",2.6,"Not my favorite, but it was free from the Long Beach crew. Cold but very strong and not a huge fan compared to all the beer consumed.","Santa Monica, California, USA","DedicatedToFun"
2968,"2013-06-30",3.0,"355mL thanks to the LA crew. Thanks to womencantsail perhaps? Pours clear orange. Medium white foam with good retention. Nose is perfumey, spice medley, orange peel. Taste is buttery, apple heavy, paper, and some celery. Palate is seltzery, watery. Strange.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

2968,"2013-06-21",3.2,"Bottle; poured a clear ruddy gold/yellow with a smallish white head. Alot of carbonation streams. Aroma was sweet and bready. Flavor really masked the abv. Sweet and bready with some fruity notes. Not that bad and quite drinkable.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
2968,"2013-05-31",3.6,"Smells like malt liquor. A little creamed corn a little bread some bo and sweat. Pours golden nice clarity thin head and lace. Flavors of corn bread grain light notes of red Apple. Very interesting take on a malt. Clean and drinkable. Thanks Dave for the rare malt!","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2968,"2013-05-31",3.7,"12oz bottle.  Pours a darker yellow, clear, light head that disipates pretty quick.  Grainy sulfur, hints of apple sweetness, meld of stewed and candied corn.  Darker bodied sweet malt up front, nice balance meld of corn that is almost grilled like with hints of red apple sweetness.  One of the finer craft malt liquors Ive had.","Washington, USA","bvc"
2968,"2013-05-21",3.2,"$10 four pack of 12oz bottles picked up at Sun Devil Liquors. It pours with a dull clear copper body with some gold hues and a short lived weak ass near white head (now were talking malt liquor). The aroma delivers up modest smooth pear and ripe honey drenched green apples and not too much else. The taste is sweet with ripe red apple like fruity esters that pull into a sense of sugary sweet malts and then more sweet fruity esters into the finish. This somehow keeps the sweetness in check and Im not sure how. I few more sips and a light semi sweet raisin note begins to be noticed that help balance out the sweetness.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2968,"2013-04-14",3.4,"Deep gold pour with creamy white head and lace. Aroma of sweet malt and a hinto abv. Sweet malt abv and a good bitter. Medium body with good carbonation.","decatur, Tennessee, USA","decaturstevo"

Flavor is a light sweetness, a bit of spiciness and hops, and the finish is extremely clean. ABV is very well hidden. Really nice Malt Liquor coming out of Havasu.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
2968,"2012-02-24",3.6,"Nice gold pour, white head.  Aroma of caramel malt, some light corn notes(not in a bad way).  Flavor is sweet, smooth and man they did a great job masking the ABV!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
