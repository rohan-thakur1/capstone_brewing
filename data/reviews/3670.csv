3670,"2017-04-17",3.8,"Turbid brown pour that looks darker in the glass. Super sweet aroma and flavor is mostly raisins and bourbon, with a little fudge and vanilla and the slightest hint of bitterness. Heavy. I like the flavors but the over the top sweetness lowers drinkability. No hint of dry hopping really.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3670,"2017-04-06",4.1,"11/26/16. 750mL bottle split with rdixon77. Amber pour with a nice tan head. Rich aroma, vanilla, oak, whiskey, dark fruits, caramel, toffee. Great flavor, rich barrel character melds well with caramel, dark fruits, and toffee. Delish!","Georgia, USA","drowland"

3670,"2017-02-06",4.2,"From notes. Enjoyed at the 4th Annual Barleywine Tasting at Nicoles house on January 28. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a darker brown with a thicker mocha colored head that falls to a film pretty quickly. The aroma is big and sweet. There is a nice caramel, molasses, oak, dark fruit, and a nice vanilla. This is almost like what good 4D was before it just plummeted. The flavor is much of the same. Its so complex and rich. The caramel and molasses offer a nice base for the dark fruits and barrel char to roll in on with just a hint of bourbon and a lovely vanilla that lingers on. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and slightly boozy finish. This is really, really good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3670,"2017-01-28",4.2,"At the Barleywine event. Aroma is bourbon, barrel, caramel, toffee, molasses, dark fruit. Appearance is brown, light broken head, slight haze. Taste is barrel, bourbon, caramel, molasses, toffee, bready, great. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy body, light carbonation, barrel and molasses aftertaste. Overall, this is fantastic.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"

3670,"2016-10-09",4.2,"Bottle from El Catador. Pours a deep copper with a tan head. Nose is caramel, toffee, rosewood, wet wood, spice, booze, and some oaky vanilla. Flavor is similar with caramel, toffee, rosewood, wet wood, rosemary?, spice, and a delightful bourbon, boozy, and vanilla burst. Delightful beer, medium body anencephaly lingering booze and caramel, and spice.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

3670,"2016-07-06",4.0,"Bottle to snifter. Pours deep brown to almost black with minimal head. Nose is Sherry oxidation with dried, dark stone fruit tones, figs, dates, prunes, plums. Modest bourbon aromas with shades of vanilla but not boozy. Taste is like an aged English barleywine with deep, complex malt flavors similar to the nose with a light hint of bitterness. Boozy warming in the finish, but never hot. A nice sipper. Not sure the dry hopping did anything for it, but a solid beer.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3670,"2016-06-12",4.0,"Bottle. Dark red brown pour, with a thin head. Dark fruit, raisin, plum, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, chocolate, sweet, molasses, oak, and some booze. Heavy, sweet, and pretty awesome barrel aged character. Good sipper.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
3670,"2016-04-11",4.1,"Dark murky reddidh brown pour. Nose is bourbon, dark fruits, prunes. Taste is bourbon, dates, dark fruits, toffee, oak. Medium-full syrupy mouthfeel. Right up there with Leon and Cognac Church (as far as non stouts go).","","knickskicks"
