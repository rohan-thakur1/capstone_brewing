3198,"2017-02-19",3.1,"Can @ home in the dark with lenincat. Spritzy, dull bread, light toast, mild melon flavor. A touch on the sweet side. Dull bitterness with forgettable hops. Somewhat floral. Kinda boring to me but maybe this can isnt super fresh.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
3198,"2016-10-22",3.3,"Shared 12 oz. cans poured to snifters showing a hazed, light gold color, with a modest layer of white, bubbly head foam, and spotty lacing. The nose was typical pils/lager scent, grass & greenery. Light to medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste added dry & earthy bitterness. No nonsense, crisp, clean, and crushable.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

3198,"2014-11-08",2.8,"This was a good beer. The taste is almost buttery, like a Lazy Mutt. Anyways, it is very flavorful.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"

3198,"2014-08-25",2.9,"For the style, Ill admit this is pretty nice. Lightly grassy and a mix of floral and herbal hops. Not a ton, just enough to notice. Crisp and clean if otherwise a little boring.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3198,"2014-07-18",3.5,"Can from Brewforia. Pours lemony gold with a slight white head. Mixed bag of hops. Sort of ""bois"". Med minus body. Flavor is very light pale malt with some mixed hop - even a little spiciness. I can imagine about any flavor here, but nothing seems to dominate. Gotta be one of the tastier pale lagers around.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3198,"2014-06-22",3.0,"Poured from can to glass. Straw hue with slight green tint and fizzy white head. Aroma is straw, cereal, cucumber, grass, metallic, slight sulphur. Mouthfeel is really nice with a light body and zesty carbonation. Taste is dry throughout with a nice bitterness in the following and a clean finish. Overall this is a nice session lager that isnt overly sulphury.","Sweet Home, Oregon, USA","Salmoniform"
3198,"2014-02-26",3.6,"Super pale with a nice haze and head. Really, a very good pilsner. Smooth with a peppery tang.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
3198,"2013-11-25",3.6,"12 ounce can from Hayduke.  We had this together via facebook chat.   I have a confession. Upon seeing the word ""lager"" on a can I had negative thoughts. These were unfounded and shame on me! This beer was a huge gusher. A white foam that was as light a can be imagined was huge and slow to fade. Cool lacing. The beer was hazy yellowish. An aroma of European hops with grass. Pale malts. Light fruit. The flavor is grassy and sometimes has sulfur. Some spice, but only a bit, lemon. It became more dry towards the finish. When the low ABV is figured in this is really good. It mixes nice drinkability with an interesting flavor profile. A good mix.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
3198,"2013-11-14",3.7,"12oz can pours out a criap straw topped with a white head. Aroma is cereal malts grass sweetness and some floral notes. Taste is as the nose with some nice cereal malts a little floral bit and some fruit on the end. Pretty good for a lager.good work guys.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
3198,"2013-11-12",3.4,"Growler from Payette. Although cereal in nature, its crisp and clean and heads above the macrobrews. Aroma is cereal grains (of course) and a hint of sour, but it has a nice fluffy head and decent lacing. Taste is light, bread, crackers, sourdough. clean and simple.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
3198,"2013-08-10",3.5,"12oz can from Tater. Rating #8. Clear straw yellow color with a small white head. Pale malt aroma, light grassiness. Mild bitterness, light malts, very clean. (2859)","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
3198,"2013-08-08",2.6,"On tap at the brewery Hazy golden with a wispy off white head and spotty lacing. Light grain cereal aroma and a soft malt flavor. The hops are a bit prominent for the style but that gives it a little bite that it needs to keep from being boring.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
3198,"2013-07-27",3.3,"12 oz can- Pours pale clear golden with a huge three finger white head that reduces quickly. Aroma is corn, grains, grass, some spice. The taste is grains again, fair amount of hops, mild peppercorns, pretty light and subdued, but better than your average pale lager. The body is thin and carbonation is foamy. Easy drinking and simple, could be a good camping beer.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
3198,"2013-06-03",4.1,"12 oz can. Pours hazy sunshine yellow with a medium white head with good retention; leaves a little lace. Aroma is corny, lemony, bready. Taste starts out lightly sweet before turning quite bitter and lingering that way long after the swallow. Medium-bodied, prickly carbonation. This really has not much in common with your average pale lager. Its bitterness and general hop character backed by noticeable bready malt make this much more interesting. This tastes the way lagers should taste. Theres more to it than the carbonated water the big brewers pump out.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
3198,"2013-04-02",3.3,"Picked up a single can tonight at the COOP... Poured into my skinny weizen glass... clear light golden with a short lasting white head that left no real lacing.

Nose is clean pale maltiness.... hops are there to balance... tough discerning what varietals.. sorta grassy/floral.

Flavor is dominated by bready maltiness... bitterness comes on mid palate on toward the finish... hops are again pretty background grassy.

Body is light... carbonation is good... extremely drinkable.

Honestly, this is pretty well done... A good pale lager made only about 10 blocks from my house. Nice.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"
3198,"2013-04-01",3.5,"Draft, Bitter Creek Ale House, Boise, ID, USA. Very pale slightly hazy yellow. Citrus and bread aroma. Very nice palette, crisp with a long citrus and coriander spice finish.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","markas101"
3198,"2012-10-13",3.6,"On draft at bier thirty. Pours straw with a thin white head. Notes of honey, sweet pilsner malts, spicy hops. Nice clean beer.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
3198,"2012-08-27",3.3,"On tap at Bier 30. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head. A nice nose of grains and honey. A big flavor, some pils malt, a light hop bite, very clean. Good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
