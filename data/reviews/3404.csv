A: Deep purple bordering on a shade of midnight. Very thin berry colored foam. Slides off glass.

M: Oily and slick, as is the Cascade norm. Alcohol is light.

Aroma is fantastic with layers of smells - brown sugar, tart cherries, oak, light earthy funk.  Very sweet with the sourness only a complement in the nose, not dominant.

The taste is just as complex and just as good.  Initial brown sugar and sweet tart cherry flavors stick around throughout with a sweet malt backbone.  The finish is where the sweetness starts to lessen as the barrel character takes over with some port and spicy, dry oak.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and highly carbonated, almost effervescent, which keeps the sweetness from becoming cloying.

Aroma is sweet and earthy with ripe cherries, dark sourness, and a hint of sweet red wine.  Flavor is sweet-tart with a lot of freshness in addition to some barrel-aged oxidative characteristics.  Cherry pit flavors (a combination of fresh cherries and port barrels) are predominant and contributes a slight tannic quality to the body as well.

3404,"2009-10-09",4.0,"750ml corked and caged bottle bomb.  This sucker was so pressurized, the cork blew the cage right off of the collar and I took a bath!  I managed to salvage it for immediate drinking, and boy am I glad I did, because this beer rocks.  The pour yields a deep, dark, garnet-mauve colored body, nice and cloudy, with a frothy, khaki colored head.  Tattered, broken cobweb lacing coats the glass well.  The aroma shows like an imperial Flemish red, with plenty of lactic tartness, semi-sweet cherry, vanilla laden oak, and a dark and fruity malt base.  Deeper inhalation reveals the port wine character, residual black cherry and berry sweetness fighting their way through the lactic acidity.  The flavor hits with a biting sourness up front, fermented cherry showing strong, transitioning into sweeter blackberry notes with loads of oak and worn leather, then diving right back into tart cherry and fine Balsamic vinegar on the finish.  It¬ís a pretty intense roller coaster ride, going from sour to sweet and then sour again.  The woody oak really concentrates on the finish, which lingers for a good while.  Lively carbonation pushes everything along swiftly, the palate showing initially full and sweet, but ending up on the drier side.  This is definitely the best Cascade sour I¬íve had to date.

3404,"2009-09-09",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Sour cherries develop cinnamon connotations that work admirably well with the prevalent black grape character, all the while riding this classy Sour Ale¬ís expansive carbonation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the cloudy mahogany.
-Bright wood notes appear here and there.
-The sourness is pleasantly long.
-Musty brett notes tag along the citrusy acidity.
-Carbonation takes a lot of room in the palate, but the bubbles are tiny.
-This might not be the most complex Sour Ale, but it is mighty tasty, and better accomplished than their Blackberry Ale, for example.

Opened fairly early on at Mike¬ís latest tasting this gem makes me want to get more of the Cascade sours after finishing the two in my cellar.  If they are anything like this one the United States has another brewer who knows how to do sours right.

Aroma / Appearance - Deeply red the blood colored body sticks to the sides of the glass.  A thin amount of head reveals moderate carbonation levels.  Strong and tart it bites the nose with a mix of cherry and brown sugar.

Flavor / Palate - Carbonated and sour the first impression attacks the tongue.  Calming after a minute or two it morphs into a rich cherry that then lingers in the throat.  Whatever they call it (double red / Flemish sour) this is a winner across the board.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Quite drinkable and soft all around.  Nice one, thanks for the bottle Ron.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

3404,"2009-07-05",4.0,"Unlabeled 750mL cork&wire provided by thesti, thanks for another PNW sour treat Tim.  As other have said this is a little bit of a gusher.  So of course its a thick and foamy off white colored head.  The lacing on it is very sticky.  Cannot see through the completely thick dark brown color that has a bit of a ruby tint to it.  Aroma is cherry but nothing acetic or nail polish, which are often the problem for Cascade. Some thick bark and wild cherry syrup, very authentic Flanders character. Taste is sweet cherry with a wild barrel aspect. Real authentic and not aggressive at all. Has a thicker mouthfeel with a bit of a slickness at the end of it.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
3404,"2009-07-05",4.3,"Pours ruby-tinged mahogany into a tumbler. Off-white micro head with excellent retention leaves spider lacing. Sour cherry aromas. Tart and refreshing with sour cherry and oak from front to back.  Lasting port finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
3404,"2009-07-03",4.1,"This beer is quite the gusher; I actually lost a couple of ounces before I could react to the foam over.  A careful pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces an almost four-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head.  As the head slowly subsides with a rocky, crag-riddled surface it leaves some nice fat lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a dark plum color that shows a hazy, rich red hue when it is held up to the light.  The aroma is quite vinous and smells of dark fruit; notes of prunes, raisins, lots of black currant, as well as some bright cherry and berry notes (this last reminds me of blackberries, blueberries and mulberries).  There is a backdrop of toasty oak in the nose as wellas a touch of toasted grain effect; some tannin, a spicy oak character and a hint of vanillin are noticeable.  The nose on this beer is pretty nice, it is well integrated and rich smelling, though I could wish for a touch more complexity.

The beer tastes lightly tart up front. It has a palate fullness and heft to it, which a lively, effervescent carbonation tries to offset; it is actually a bit excessively carbonated, but the body of the beer still stands up to this excess quite well.  A nice sourness can almost be bracing, it couples with a tannic bite towards the finish that makes this that much more puckering.  Spicy oak and wood flavors play a more prominent role than they did in the nose, but the fruitiness is much more subdued in the flavor; this last is likely because this beer is quite dry tasting, with little residual sugars.  Still the fruit notes are noticeable here and remind me of a dry, fruit forward red wine; notes of berry, dark-concentrated plum, tart currant flavors, some washed out cherry skin and even some port-like fruit notes are noticeable here.  As the beer warms up the fruit does become more evident though.  There is a tart bite from the acidity that is most lactic, but there also seemed to be a rounded acid influence from the fruit character.  Especially after the beer settles down (from the initial carbonation level), the texture is lush and structed from the tannic influence, yet it is still quite drinkable; velvet-like and silky seem like apt adjectives for this brew.  There is some spice character here as well and a bit of a biting note that is contributed by the rich fruit / malt character (sort of reminiscent of a spicy fruit skin flavor).

I like that this has a nice oak backbone to it; that and the tartness really helps to bring a suave balance to the jam-like, rich fruit character.  I paired this beer with some fish tacos for the last 25cl and this brings out a peppery spiciness from the oak as well as more of the wood-like flavors, but what it really does is accentuate the rich fruit character that is in this beer.  This is a really nice, rich, complex, layered beer that retains its ample drinkability.  A fantastic beer, that I am quite happy to have polished a bottle off of.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3404,"2009-06-22",4.4,"Bottle @ The Trappist. Poured a dark ruby. Nose is cellar, acidic tartness mixed with unripe fruits, oak and some wine. Flavor is a sharp acidity, chardonnay, some sweet cherries, tart fruitiness, plums and sherry. Finishes dry with some sweet fruit undertones. This is an amazing beer. Refreshing, tart and easy drinking. I went through 3 bottles during my visit.","Alaska, USA","gkost"

3404,"2009-06-15",4.1,"Bottle shared at a BeerAdvocate tasting.  Dark opaque reddish-brown color with a beige head.  Tart aroma of sour cherries, oak, and vinegar.  Flavor more of the same, very well-rounded with a nice, not over-the-top tartness, vinous notes, and barrel flavors.  Lively carbonation and medium body with a tart finish.  An excellent sour overall.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Tart aroma of oak, xmas tree, and cherry, with a little bit of cheese.  A little bit of caramel malt pokes through by the finish.

Pours a dense burgundy with a frothy, light reddish-tan head that slowly dissipates into a medium ring around the glass. Aroma is tart cherry and cranberry and maybe a big of sour funk/yeast. This beer is fairly tart with cherry and cranberry, flight bitterness and is most certainly mouth puckeringly sour. Its a light, crisp effervescent beer and is extremely drinkable and gets a bit hotter as you sip it.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DiabolikDUB"

A bit fizzy, but otherwise clean.  Much more complex as it warmed.  This is another great one from Cascade. (10/5/9/4/18 4.6)

Rerate Bottle as part of epic sour tasting with callmemimckey on 4/29/10. Pours medium brown, little off-white head.  Nose of cherry, lemon, orange, and a touch of pine/oak.  Flavor is very dry citrus and sour cherry with a dry oak finish.  A little wine like tannins on the finish as well.  ABV hidden well.  An exceptional sour that held its own against others on that epic night (8/4/9/4/17 -  4.2)","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cprochak"

Very oaky, lots of port barrel, soft fruit/cherry undertones, and then dry wine notes in the finish. Tart, but very oaky, lots of port. Dry lingering acidic finish. Extremely well carbonated and vibrant that works to distribute the tart/dryness throughout the palate. I am still looking for you Goose Island hat guy!

Intense burnt oak, currant and cabernet/syrah wine character up front.  Prickly and peppery, somewhat fizzy, but well-conditioned and well-matured - the port barrel character seems to meld with a general red wine/currant/black cherry/plum flavor profile but it¬ís by no means a detriment to this beer.  Exceptionally zesty and alive.  Wonderful stuff.
