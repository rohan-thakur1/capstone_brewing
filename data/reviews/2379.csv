Light medium bodied with a nice slightly oily texture. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. Very well balanced flavor profile with a bit of complexity and quite good intensity for an amber ale.

2379,"2014-06-11",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 4-20-12 - 
Served on cask in a pint glass

Appearance  Served a medium golden-orange color with a large white head. The head faded moderately fast giving way to a light amount of lacing.

Smell  The aroma is of some caramel and more citrus hop in nature. Mixed with the heavier aromas there are lighter biscuit and piney hop aromas as well.

Taste  The breadiness is the first to meet the tongue. There is a lighter caramel sweetness at first, that intensifies to the middle of the taste. When the caramel really comes into play nice citrus hop flavors meet the tongue. These soon take over the taste and mix with some good pine hop. At the very end there is still a very light caramel sweetness in the bready backbone, but the hops dominate the stage and leave a crisp bitterness on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  Being on cask the carbonation was a bit on the lower side. This gave a very creamy body feeling on the tongue and really allowed, at first the sweet flavors to really be experienced, but later allowed for the smoother hop flavors to sit on the tongue and linger. It was very satisfying.

Overall  This is a very nice cask beer. The mouthfeel from the cask pour really accentuated some of the nice taste qualities of the beer. It was delicious.","","Darkmagus82"

I had this in a pint glass.
The appearance was a gentle dark amber color with a nice level foamy one finger head with an adequate foamy lacing sticking finely to the sides of the glass.
The smell had a decent amount of caramel malts up front and lets a gentle amount of bitter citrus hops coming in slightly as the beer warmed.
The taste was bitter and sweet ranging at somewhat different times but ends up combining more as the beer warmed. The aftertaste was really nice as it was pure bittersweetness altogether. The finish was somewhat dry but still had a nice backing by the hops and malts.
On the palate, it sat about a medium in body and had a decent sessionable quality to it.
Overall, I say this was a pretty good American Amber well worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2379,"2013-02-11",3.7,"Though Tröegs HopBack Amber Ale rates pretty highly, I have to say its only a good beer. Its pretty much the epitome of the amber ale style in that its pretty hoppy but uses earthy/spicy hops rather than citrus or pine.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Dark amber/copper hue, transparent but not much visible carbonation. Forms a small, white, frothy head which leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Light caramel malty scent and mild spicy hop fragrance.

Taste:  Mellow caramel sweetness up front followed by significant bitterness through the middle. A definite spice character from the nugget hops with just a hint of citrus peel. Its a bit dry, but not cloying so, in fact its well contained and balanced making it a drinker-friendly palate. Theres more malt and hop character than a pale ale, but theres nothing about this beer that makes it stand out among countless other beers of the style. 

Drinkability: With a medium body and a mouthfeel thats lively, but contained, Tröegs HopBack Amber Ale is no challenge to drink at all. I was a bit surprised to find out its 6% ABV, but at least its efficient for that weight as its not filling or disproportionately heavy.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2379,"2012-04-09",3.6,"Brief write up. Generally, Im not a amber ale kind of person, but this ones a notch above most others thanks to its generous, but not overdone hop profile.

Served On: 6/23/2011
Glassware: Plastic Cup

Enjoyed on tap from a 16oz plastic cup last night at Sovereign Bank Stadium (PA Road Warriors Vs. York Revolution). Ive had this beer before from a 12 oz. bottle, but it was a few months beyond the best-by date (as with many craft beers from the local distributors here). 

Look: Deep copper with a resiny appearance as it swirled in the glass (plastic cup). Head was present but dissolved within a few minutes. Lacing was nice and consistent. 

Smell: Noticed some sweeter malts at first  then became more hop-forward as it sat (almost like an IPA).

Taste: A sticky mount feel with the malts hitting the tongue first. Hops followed with some citrus bitterness to balance with the initial malts. Finish seemed to maintain the bitterness. I found this to be unusual for an amber ale. But it was nice.

This is a solid beer that follows suit with other Tröegs beers Ive had. The extra hoppiness was certainly a bonus here. I noticed the same surprise in Tröegs Pale Ale.

Serving type: on-tap

2379,"2011-11-17",3.3,"Served on cask into a nonic pint at Als of Hampden. This version has 3x palisade hops.
A - Pours dark amber with a small one finger head, dissipating to a light film of head, leaving faint rings of lacing down the glass.
S - If you think the normal version of hopback is hoppy then you aint seen nothing yet. This one is HOPPY, like the normal version but on hoppy steroids. Huge amounts of grassy, piney, citrus hops. A touch of sweetness from the malt is a welcome addition and helps add some contrast to the nose.
T - An absolute wall of grassy hops up front giving way quickly to a touch of caramel malt sweetness and a bit of dryness from the yeast. Finish is plenty of hop bitterness that lingers for only a short time because it is washed away by the thin, watery, feel. Very nice flavors but the thin finish ruins it a bit. If it wasnt so thin I would say this is the best hopback I have ever had but I just cant do that with how it is.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. The feel was a bit on the watery side which I didnt like too much. Lingering hop bitterness in the finish but it does not linger on the pallet for very long.
D - Fairly high. I love the normal version of hopback, and I have had this on cask a few times before, but the watery feel brought this one down a notch. I still think it is the best cask hopback I have ever had.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

2379,"2011-01-12",3.2,"Poured into a pint glass.

4.5 A: Really nice looking brew. Clear orange amber color. Two inches of dense head with above average retention and tons of lacing.

4.0 S: Loads of floral hop aroma going on. Grapefruity citrus and a bit of woodiness.

3.5 T: Pretty good, but lacks depth. Grapefruit citrus hops again, but not as pronounced as Id like. Seems to be some crystal malt, but malt character is minimal and makes the beer a bit unbalanced even though it isnt that bitter to begin with. Based on the nose, I expected a lot more. This is very much like a watered down Nugget Nectar.

3.0 M: Surprisingly light in body. Carbonation is lower than I would like. Very smooth, but that simply isnt enough.

3.5 D: This is Nugget Nectar after suffering from a debilitating disease for several years. Its not bad by any stretch, but it doesnt stand alone.

The nose is rife with floral hop notes and a surprisingly crisp, fruity freshness.  Possible detection of caramel tones. Mouthfeel is somewhat lacking.  Its aroma belies a full body malty feel that is not there.  It is possible that the over-bittering is simply masking the malt flavor.

2379,"2010-04-16",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Floral, spicy and citrusy hops proliferate atop and within biscuity cereals, leading this impressive Amber Ale to a balanced wooden hop bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam slowly disappears into the clear amber.
-Now this is an attractive nose for what is usually a mailed-in style. Bravo!
-Light caramelization accompanies the biscuity character, but doesnt really bother.
-The mouthfeel is lean and quenching.
-The chosen hops and grain bill are really harmonious, which I find is not often the case in this often neglected, brew-by-numbers Amber Ales.

2379,"2010-04-08",4.2,"A- Translucent amber colored body with thick white head that quickly dwindles to 1/2 a finger. Decent head retention and some lacing left behind in the glass.

S- Bitter hops hit the nose first followed by a sweet caramel malt. The bitter hops smell is big and masks the caramel malt.

T- Initial taste of strong citrus hops and grapefruit with a solid malt backbone. The finish reverses. The sweet caramel malt comes foreward for the finish with mildly bitter hops in the background. Sweet caramel malt lingers with hints of hops. Very well done and well balanced.

M- high carbonation and medium weight body. Carbonation accents grapefruit and aggressive hops at first then rounds out for a smooth and wonderful finish.

D- Im not usually a big fan of amber ales. I had this one because it was in the Troegs multi-pack I bought. This is very drinkable and my favorite amber ale yet. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Another great brew by Troegs that I will have again.

Aroma: Decent pine hop nose, light floral notes, and some caramel malt aromas.  Not as forthcoming as I was expecting from Troegs.
Taste: Very hop forward with strong floral and soap notes.  Light pine notes lurk there as well.  From the malt side I get light biscuit notes.  Okay, but a little on the soapy side for my liking.
Palate: Low carbonation (to be expected from a firkin) with a medium, slightly dry mouthfeel.  Medium, bitter finish.

Given the fact that it was an American Amber Ale, I was expecting some sort of combination of citrusy hops and caramel malt; and was reinforced in this expectation after reading the commerical description.  While the hops were right there on the palate, providing smooth bitterness and a nice flavor, I found the malt portion of the palate to be essentiallky non-existent.  At best, there was a slight touch of caramel; but less of a note than one would expect in this style.

Aroma is biscuity, hoppy, slightly burnt toast though not unpleasant, turkey.  Smells like Avery IPA or a less intense DFH 90.  Taste is smooth, light, with low bitterness.  A bit watery though not unpleasant really.  A slight hint of caramel comes through in the taste but the sweetness in general is kept in check. Could be a good session beer.  Ambers are kind of boring to me and this one didn’t really change my mind though I wouldn’t mind drinking a large amount of these.  I much prefer the Nugget Nectar but this isn’t bad.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
2379,"2008-08-30",3.2,"Pours a ruby brown in color that is translucent.  About quarter inch of head/froth forms on the pour.  Smell is a nice balance.  First all malt, then deeper some hops appear.  There’s also some sort of spice notes as well.  Taste is very resinous.  Not overly bitter, but hop flavor.  Don’t know how to exactly describe it.  Plenty of a malt backbone to support it.  This is different than anything I’ve had of the style.  Decent mouthfeel, but a tad cloying.  Glad to see Troegs in Ohio.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

Sure its tasty, but is it an amber ale or just a copper colored IPA.  You cant just bury everything in fresh hops.  I sometimes think you could fresha nd dry hop a Belgian white and it would score a 91 here.

A sweet and subtle aroma -- a little too subtle for my taste.  It had a perfect amount of hoppiness and a very smooth, almost syrupy body.  Pumpkin and toffee notes and a pleasantly dry finish.  Precisely what keeps me from disparaging this beer also keeps me from praising it; it’s too subtle in many ways, almost intentionally restrained, though that may be the result of it being below optimal temperature.

Glass: shaker
Purchased at: Troegs Sampler at Shop Rite Liquors in Hamilton NJ
Consumed on/at: 12:30am on Saturday March 8th, 2008

sensory first impression: Mountainous head - like a hilly landscape. Off white head. Aroma is very nice. Some light carbonated activity, and that same reddish sunset color. This beer isnt watery like many Troegs. It has a fuller feel, though not like many of may favorites, it is quite acceptably good. Lacing, taste, color, and flavor all come together nicely here. ABV is right on the money. Starting to wish the sampler had been a 12 pack of these. Lacing is increasingly beautiful. Head hangs on at a .25 inch.

Aroma/Olfactory:
Malt flavor is: Caramel, a bit of chocolate, and flowery.
Hop flavor is: flowery, herby.
Yeast flavor is: sourdough.
Other flavors include: hints of vanilla and spices.

Visuals/Appearance:
Color is: bright amber red. Nice color.
Liquid is: clear, and clean.
Head and lace are: bumpy, white, and lacy.

Taste/Flavor:
Maltiness or Sweetness level is: medium to heavy.
Hoppiness or Bitterness level is: light to medium.
Sour level is: light

Palate/Tactile:
Body or Mouthfeel is: medium.
Texture is: creamy, sticky
Carbonation is: average, active.
Finish is: long, enjoyable, and more so as time goes on.

Overall experience: The best of the sampler by far, but really the only enjoyable beer, and there are far better hoppy beers out there. Ill repeat it here. look at Victory, Stone, and Rogue to understand what its really all about, then find a way to innovate, and youll have something.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

It poured a pretty rich amber color with decent head formation.  Aroma was light, citrus-y, hops.  Flavor was definitely hoppy.  I could find a bit of fault in the beer - it was just a touch stale and cardboard-y up front and just a touch sour at the finish, which might not have been the case if Id had a bit fresher bottle (mine was dated 5/5/07, meaning it was just over 4 months old when I drank it).

A few mores sniffs pulls up the caramelly malt. The flavor is a bit of a letdown comparatively, light but sweet, low-moderate bitterness.

Tastes like the smell of a citrus-scented urinal cake.  Clean, polished, and fruity - but with a strained quality that suggests undrinkability.  Vanilla and toffee tinted malts scamper in belatedly on the back end to salvage things a little.  Simply too much obvious superficiality, which sort of whispers loudly with every sip.

2379,"2007-06-29",4.2,"Pours clear copper, with a medium and lasting head. Aroma is delicious spicy chocolate, apples and raisins. Flavor is definitely hop-spicy fruit, but has some powerful malty nut and chocolate richness that supports the hops well. Medium-bodied palate starts with the smooth malt, but explodes with astringent, tingly hops and carbonation, finishing dry. This is a top-notch beer that would make a rather interesting entry in the IPA category. Definitely better than Mac and Jacks.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
2379,"2007-06-26",3.7,"Nice! Dark brown pour with a nice 2 finger white head that laced the whole glass. Aroma of hops. Taste of caramel and roasted malt until the swallow, then the hops grab the back of your throat and hold on. By the aroma youd think this beer was more hoppy, but it hides it well.

Pours a clear golden amber with a moderate linen white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace.  Pleasant aroma of oranges with a bit of caramel along with a few pine notes.  The flavor is weak caramel followed by some citrusy hops, however, the flavor lacks any real depth and seems to evaporate on the palate, leaving behind a bitter and mostly tasteless finish.  Disappointing.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

5/3/08 - RERATE - This is what happens when you rate one of your favorite beers early.  Time to revisit.  This is one of my favorite ""go-to"" beers.  Its on draft all over.  Any who, here are the notes.  Pours a clear amber with deep red hues.    Slightly khaki, thick foamy head.  Great lacing and retention.  Nose is grassy/earthy hops with a subtle bright citrus crispness.  A good amount of caramel and toffee aroma.  Medium watery mouth feel.  A moderate caramel malt backbone with some hints of chocolate and light roast, which is accented well with a moderate earthy bitter and hop flavor.  This hits you mainly towards the end and lingers well into the after.  The back of the palate screams ""More!  More!""  A very well balanced beer that lets you know its there without being all up in your face.  One of my favorites.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","dpjuart"

The aroma has plenty of biscuity notes and mild caramel sweetness and a distinct, piny hop character. The foundation is typical of an amber ale with sweet biscuits and a semi-buttery finish. The hops, however, are much more defined than the average amber. They are not very intense, as far as sheer strength, but they are very well pronounced in depth. Plenty of piny notes of cannibus add a nice acidic tone to the brew and the finish is reminiscent of a bit of bark. I didnt feel this one leaned towards a grapefruit flavor like some of its counterparts do, which is neither good nor bad, really. This is a very nice take on the style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

2379,"2006-01-22",3.3,"There is actually a substance known as amber.  Its not just what you should name your daughter if you want her to grow up to be a stripper, its also some kind of petrified tree sap, or so I was led to believe by the movie Jurassic Park.

Anyway, this is a deep reddish brown, while amber the substance (and your future porn star daughter) are more on the yellow side.

Anyway, this beer is definitely extremely hoppy, as advertised.  Almoset enough malty flavor to offset the nearly ridiculous hop characteristics, Ill be tasting these hops in burps I let out 3 days from now.","High Bridge, New Jersey, USA","AdamSkillin"

This one has a good balance, a nice woodsy hoppy taste, a pleasant flowery aroma with bitter notes and is pretty drinkable.

Tingly pine sprits blankets the palate and then steps aside for a toasty and caramel malt backbone that hits the session spot.  Caramel and toffee play a prominent, nearly sugary, role.  Sweet resin and moderate rye similarities help to impart a smooth sensation thats void of astringency (thank Christ.)  Medium bodied and remarkably well-balanced.

2379,"2005-10-12",3.8,"bottle-another thanks to hopdog for this fine amber ale.  this beer poured orange with a small sudsy white head.  this beer looks light for an amber ale thats for shure.  could qualify for an esb, but we will get into the reasons why here later.  aroma has nice earthy hops, toasted grains, acidic yeast, light pine and leafy hops.  wow, flavors are pretty hoppy, moreso than the aroma suggests-pine, light grapefruit, and lightly citric (lemon) with some reasiny/sappy notes as well.  nice medium body with a full feal.  slightly over-carbonated, but it actually did ok for this beer.  lots of malt sweetness to balance out the onslaught of leafy hops.  nice clean yeast notes once again balance out the hops and put things all together.  For me, this seems a little too light on the malt bill for an amber.  not really any caramel sweetness.  This is not a bad thing, but this beer definately would pass as an ESB in most cases due to its hops.  .  The resiny finish becomes more bitter over time.  The full mouthfeal with all these piney/resiny hops almost makes this beer taste like a mini barleywine (think a watered down bigfoot).

2379,"2005-03-24",3.7,"12 oz bottle;  It pours a medium amber w/ a lasting, medium sized off white head of smaller bubbles.  Aroma is a wonderful floral and lemon citrusy hop at first, then it gets some hints of orange before it warms up.  Also some hints of perfumey, piney, hairspray alcohol, but its strange given the lower ABV.  Some lightly toasted malts, hints of caramel, and low fruitiness.  Very well balanced w/a distinct caramel flavor up front, then becomes lightly citrusy hoppy after.  Toasty malt comes in third w/ the dry finish and floral hop flavored aftertaste.  Dry m/f, but not astringent, lower carb., & lighter medium body.  Overall a very enjoyable beer for an amber ale.  Very pleasant hop characteristics balanced by a caramel malt flavor.

Grapefruit hops aroma some malt sweetness. Taste jumps right into hops,first floral, then grapefruit and citrus later. The taste is pretty well bitter throughout with a long lasting bitter finish. After getting halfway through the beer, I adjusted to the hops and a very slight malt backbone appeared with a touch of sweetness to offset the bitterness. Good beer, and I love hoppiness in beer, but it could use a bit more balance.  This is really more of an american IPA than an amber ale.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
2379,"2005-01-14",2.6,"This is one of my favorite styles and I was greatly disappointed by the beer.  Great dark rich amber color, but no head.  Surprisingly little malt for an amber, surprisingly little body.  Lots of good hoppy bitterness, and an interesting sweet caramel finish underlying the bitterness.  A disconcerting sour taste was present as well.  But, despite this different flavors, my principal impression was  nothing.  Too thin in the mouth.  Too little intensity.  No integration or integrity, just odd disconnected sensations, in a vast empty hole in beer space.  OK, if I wanted citrus hoppyness in an amber I would be very happy to have another HopDevil.  This amber, though, was drain pour.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
2379,"2005-01-13",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2005 (12 oz bottle, obtained in trade with jasonp, thanks Jason!) This is very lemony smelling for beer, reminiscent of Lemon Pledge or something.  I wonder how well it cleans the furniture, as I should be doing more cleaning and less beer drinking.  NAHHHHH!  Flavorwise, this is an odd amber.  Its not especially flavorful, and its just not all that malty for the style.  Citrusy, mildly bitter and fresh tasting hops is also quite prevalent in the flavor, with a mild, bready and lightly sweet maltiness providing a lighter base.  I think it tastes a little like detergent.  Medium bodied, with a fairly clean palate.  Medium to light amber in color with a slight haze.  Off-white head slowly recededs to a thin layer and leaves a few spots of lace on the glass.  Not bad, but apparently this just isnt my type of amber.

The aroma is strong out of the bottle but very light on the nose...sweet and caramelly with malt, and a hint of pine cone and twigs. Very light and almost non-apparent as it warms (though I guess we could blame that on olfactory saturation :) ). The flavor is very light, with malts and caramels pretty much dominating, and a good hint of tickling carbonation. Sweet, very little bittering hop presence, save for the finish. Some fruity nectar in the finish. Medium to light bodied mouthfeel...i mean i did enjoy this beer...but I didnt find anything about it which really stood out.

Amber/dark orange body, thin clumping off-white head.  Cerealy aroma with light caramel and earthy hops.  Flavor reminded me of many American Strong Ales but with less emphasis on alcohol; sweet cereals and caramel played off the earthy, somewhat piney hops.  Ive had beers just like this that were classified as IPAs.  That said, there are so many beers out there just like this one.  I like a maltier Amber Ale.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Pours a big country cream head over a pretty amber body; the head turns rocky as it starts to fade. The hops are clearly of an American IPA mode, piney more than citrusey.

I really like this beer, but I might just be homesick for Montana.  Better re-rate in the future, meantime I'll drink some more Troegs.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

2379,"2004-03-02",4.0,"Orange amber in appearance, very nice lacing.  Aroma grapefruit with a faint hint of roasted malt.  Earth and citrus hops blend very nicely with caramel malts.  I would have considered this an APA.  Whatever you call it, this is a highly enjoyable, relaxing, and well made brew.  I might start dropping this one in as a bonus bottle in trades.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Soft, faint aroma of caramel, citrusy-orange, light hoppy pineness, tight but light. Taste of smooth caramel, sweet roasty malts start then leading into a light piney, citrusy floral fresh mild hop bite and bitterness. Reminds me more of a pale then an amber, but dulled with much more malts. Feel is medium bodied, creamy, and partially thin. I don't know what to think of this one, I thought for a second, cuz of the name, it was an IPA, but nope, whatever it is, its pretty damn drinkable stuff, quite enjoyably smooth.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Very Nice!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"

Flavor has notes of toasted malt, caramel, some grapefruit, pine and citrus. Spicy and refreshing, this is one of the standards that I keep coming back to. Love those whole flower hops. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with moderate carbonation. Good head retention. Most amber ales are so boring that you just want to kill yourself. Such is not the case with this beer.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"

Delicious and deeper than an IPA (which is what the brew smells like)...definitely multidimensional than the ordinary amber, tons-o-malt, ale. Spicy aroma of fresh floral/citrus hop blend. First sip has a quite dry palate. As I tasted more, it became more sticky and lasting. Perfectly done...I swear I tasted rye in the finish.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2379,"2004-02-11",4.4,"Brilliant coppery peach. Fat, sticky, rocky off-white head. Sweet pine cone aromas adorned with a lush glazed malt base. Lemon oil, toasted nuts, graham, and jellied fruit whispers. Soft mouthfeel. Amply fluffy, creamy carbonation. Explosively jellyish right away with light acididity leaving a trail of piny hops and softly sweet malts. Hops become more peppery than piney at mid-stage and the malt toastiness fades into a rounded, flavorsome blend of passion fruit and spicy anise. Immensely minerally, round, bready finish with honeysuckle, jellied  fruits, citrus, and hop leaf snippets. Pine notes and glazed, bready malts coat the tongue as they linger well past the finish.

The taste is more of the same - hops! Citrusy and thick with a resinous mouthfeel. Some sweetness tries to creep in here as well but kind of gets pushed out.

Nice amount of PNW hop flavor--a perfect amount of citrus and pine flavors framing some considerable, delicious malt.  There is a very nice amount of malt here--incredible balance.
