476,"2017-05-08",3.9,"Bottle 330ml. Totally black with big, light-brown head, good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, cacao with delicate, sweet note of vanilla, intense and very nice. Definitely dry, a little bit roasty, chocolate, coffee and subtle sour note from malt in aftertaste. Im surprised there is no vanilla in taste, maybe tiny, sweet note in the finish. Beer is medium body, dry, quite light, medium carbonated (a little bit too much), very good sample of stout but I expected more notes of bourbon barrel but there are quite poor but noticable. Anyway very tasty stout.","Wroclaw, POLAND","PabloZab"

476,"2017-02-12",3.7,"Pours a viscous black body with a fizzy, dark brown and short-lived head that ends up as a partially covering film and some build-up at the walls. Strong aroma of dark roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate and wood, with dark dried fruits in the back. Strong flavour of dark roasted malt, coffee, and dark and bitter chocolate. In the back I find wood, tobacco, ash, fruitiness and hints of peat(!). Surprisingly light sweet taste with a long-lasting and rather heavy bitter finish. Mid-bodied, dry on the palate, moderate carbonation. I nice one, although I would have liked it less dry. And since this is a bourbon edition, I guess it would be fun if there was actually some bourbon present.

Aroma of oatmeal, coffee beans, some hops, slight chocolate, subdued bourbon vanilla notes, roasted malts, slight smoke to it. A mixture of the green hoppy stuff, with delicious sticky bourbon sweetness. I do prefer the sweet sticky stuff, so Maybe six months in the celler would do this beer good, to me atleast. Taste is slightly sweet up front, with a somewhat heavy bitterness. Medium bodied, with a flat but pricking carbonation. I like this no doubt, but a bit ""green"" for my likings.","Aalborg, DENMARK","MotherBrother"
