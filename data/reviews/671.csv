671,"2017-04-18",3.9,"Almost opaque dark brown/deep red color with a copper hue. Slightly creamy and bubbly light brown 2-3 finger head, lasting around 5 minutes, not much legs, average lace, light swirl effect. Flavors of liquorice, cherries, dark berries, molasses, dark grains, coffee, chocolate, oak, toffee, herbal spices. Thick fruity and malty sweetness, with balanced bitterness. Soft creamy, and slick, medium body with crispy carbonation. Medium to strong strength finish, slightly leathery and dry, moderately spicy, light vinous dark ester fruits, herbal and bready, soft woody whiskey feel that lingers for a while. Not the bold type of scotch ale, but well intensified, nor overly spicy. Good freshness while highly warming. Very good taste, quickly dominated by a nice barrel feel. Overall excellent quality craft.","Quebec, CANADA","Bierdimpfe"
671,"2017-02-24",3.8,"Bouteille. Liquide filtré et profondément ambré aux reflets rouges. Tête cossue formée de grosses bulles. La tête ne saccroche toutefois pas au verre mais peu importe. Nez bien léger où les épices dominent sur trame boisée. Présence fort appréciable des malts qui confère une belle structure à la bière. Un beau petit côté butter Scotch également mais jamais écoeurant ni sucré. Cest fou la buvabilité de cette bière! Les gorgées senlignent et jamais au grand jamais je ne sens lalcool. Parfaitement légère en bouche, facile à boire, bien effervescente et maltée. Les saveurs sont somme toutes peu complexes et le mouthfeel léger comme une plume.

671,"2017-01-13",3.9,"Gifted by mon frere: pours brown with a small head. Aroma is caramel, malts, bananas, ambiguous fruitiness. Taste is somewhat sweet and quite malty. Has some characteristics you would find in a Belgian ale, like the fruitiness and even something in the yeastiness. Body has not too heavy but still had oomph. A pleasant beer to drink.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
671,"2016-11-06",3.6,"Bière brunâtre, aux reflets plutôt noirs, avec une fine ligne de carbonatation et un teint opaque. Au nez, cassonade, malt torréfié et caramel annoncent une bière plutôt sucré. En bouche, la bière est intéressante et sort du lot pour une scotch ale. Le liquide est, certes, sucré comme une scotch ale, mais laisse également des impressions de fumée et damertume un peu terreuse, ce qui fait plutôt différent des scotch ales plus classiques. La bière a également une bonne effervescence en bouche. Au final cest bien fait mais sans plus.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"
671,"2016-08-19",3.6,"Bouteille de 9 mois. 
Apparence : Brune foncée, reflets rouges, carbonatation moyenne tout comme la rapidité, beau col moka, peu de dentelle. 
Nez : Sucre grillé, fruits rouges (canneberges, cerises?), boisé, côté épicé. 
Goût : Caramel (un peu fade?), fruits rouges mûrs, boisé, assez sucrée, touche damertume en finale avec le sucre résiduel. 
Sensation : Effervescence moyenne, épicée sur la langue, corps moyen, finale de longueur moyenne. 
Bref : Bonne bière présentant un équilibre entre le malt (caramel sucré), le bois, lamertume et les fruits. Il manque par contre de profondeur à mon goût. Ça se boit bien, mais il ny a rien pour faire ressortir cette offrande du lot. Il ma semblé noté lalcool davantage dans certains brassins précédents. Bien équilibrée.","Quebec, CANADA","Adamsville"

Arômes de café, caramel brûlé, alcool, mélasse et banane noir. Plus ou moins complexe, peut-être un peu trop de notes brûlées. En bouche, cest surtout orienté vers le caramel brûlé et la mélasse. Suivent des saveurs de café cappuccino, chocolat noir à lorange et citron. Par contre on retrouve un meilleur équilibre quau nez mais manque encore de complexité. Carbonatation un peu trop élevé.

Malty aroma of molasses and caramel with hints of allspice and vanilla. I did not pick up on the ripe berries until later in the glass. Light sweet taste initially with a moderate sweet spicy finish.

A beautiful, complex Scotch Ale that I wish would be available in PEI along with everything they make. Light on the carbonation and an easy drinking mouthfeel add to the enjoyment.

Arôme principal de banane très mûre et sucrée accompagné deffluves de pain grillé et de caramel, avec un alcool évident et quelques notes boisées. On décèle également des odeurs de fruits foncés séchés (raisin sec, datte, pruneau). Nez intéressant mais un peu surprenant pour le style (banane?), très intense, complexité adéquate.

Un certain houblon floral semble se pointer en fin de bouche en route vers une finale à lamertume de faible à modérée. Bonne intensité, complexité moyenne.

671,"2011-04-24",3.1,"On tap at Churchkey. Served in a snifter.

Pour yields a very dark-bodied brew with a half-finger light tan head, which quickly recedes, falling into a thin collar. The nose pushes forward with a very nice malty sweetness, reminding most of a combination of molasses and brown sugar with a hint of caramel thrown in for good measure. A slight amount of booze backs that up. There is a light earthiness to it as well.

The flavor is a bit of a departure from the nose, and not in tye best way. The mingling of elements is gone, leading instead a medium body containing merely a good dose of sweet malt. Not quite cloying, but not super-enjoyable considering how one-dimensional it is. There is a bit of light earth and booze in the finish as well. Low carbonation. Pretty decent, but not something I would come back to.

671,"2009-07-18",4.3,"Clear, dark brown brew that produced a very nice bright tan head (actually the colour is somewhat strange) about one thumb thick, tons of 360 degree lacing, decent surface coverage left over. The aroma is very interesting and unlike anything Ive had before: firstly, I can detect the tomato that some others have noted (thx), brown sugar with the sweetness kept under control, dark berries that seem smoked, caramel, prune?, some kind of cooking chocolate, biscuit, interesting spice that only reminds me of a very candied version of spices found in the typical Speyside Whiskey. The aroma is ever changing as well while never producing an ""off"" smell. The flavour is not as interesting but still very appealing. More tomato juice mixed in with a healthy dose of well chosen spices (most obvious is licorice), roasted malts tied directly to the overall sweetness, salt... this gets more and more like Mottss Garden Cocktail which is much spicier than V8, plums, peat - all in no particular order. The only impression of alcohol that I get is loosely found in the lingering after taste. As I go Ive noticed that this beer sometimes comes across thinner than I assume. Nice subtle sweet yet spicy grain finish with slight chocolate that I can only notice as the lingering goodness begins to wane. I picked this one up randomly and damn it if I didnt chose one of the best beers Ive had in months.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Flavor is very good and this is my new favorite Scotch Ale.  (If only I could get it regularly and inexpensively...)  Anyhow, the peat and smoke flavors come through very nicely and play off the sugar and fruit.  At the same time, there is a bit of a nut flavor that helps smooth things out.  Im guessing that my attraction to this is the simple fact that the sweetness is held in check so nicely... unlike so many other scotch ales Ive tried that end up just being a cloying mess.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Aroma - peanut butter, malt, rubber, perhaps caramel, and the most curious whiff of strawberry jam finds its way in as well. Well carbonated, full body. Wow, this unexpected strawberry jam impression comes through very strong in the flavor amid the more traditional caramelly malt flavors. I didnt pick this out the first time trying this beer, but this is incredibly unique, and quite a delight. Builds on a base of earthy underbrushy bitterness, almost hoppy. Aftertaste of pumpernickel or rye or some such. This bottle is performing significantly better than the previous one. Overall, well made, enjoyable, gives me a new look on the style.

671,"2008-07-21",3.3,"The notorious ""new"" batch.  Cold clean red.  Chocolate soda fountain, root beer candy, wet earth, alcohol aroma.  Raspberries in vanilla.  Sugary, damp, and distantly salty.  Salted rye bread.  Raw.

Coarse wooden chocolate flavor.  Not rich and bold like an earthy, semisweet, mostly real cocoa chocolate, but dry and sugary like an extract syrup.  The fruit character is bitter and tannic, like the skin of a plum or a dried date.  Smooth, velvety almond sweetness in a rich and sharp spirit-like texture, with plenty of mapley woodiness.  Still unpolished.  No subtlety in the delivery.

Medium-full palate is softly carbonated and surprisingly not sticky.  Tinny mineral bitterness precedes a lasting, dry rubbing of alcohol and caramelized almonds in the finish.  Rather frustrating.  Its redeeming qualities are ever present, but suffocated, and what might be most annoying is that there isn’t some obvious flaw lending the weight.  It just never quite arrives.  Dany was right.

A few threads and ropes of lacework stuck around for the duration.
Aromatics are laced with bright and clean malt. Loads of malt and scorched kettle.
An alcohol presense makes itself known as well as a hint of smoke.
The mouthfeel is crisp, creamy, and sticky. Residuals stay tacked to the tongue.
The pallet is malt-forward, to say the least.
Loads of ripe barley, caramel, and a whiskey- like alcohol note.
Bitterness is subdued, as is all other hopping.
This brew is all about clean malt character and substantial strength.
Finishes with lingering malt, warming alcohol, and a hint of smoldered barley.

I was told that this brewery makes thier own barley, but the label has plenty of cryptic french, so I cannot confirm.
I was ready to be let down by this obscure small bottle that cost $6.99 in Quebec, but wowza! 
Probably the best Scotch ale Ive ever had.

Aroma is amazing: papery seaweed, like sushi wrapping, curry, light smoke(never acrid), vanilla, allspice, and the biggest dose of peat Ive ever encountered outside an Islay single malt. This kept oozing with layers of complexity, I had yet to even taste it. More in the aroma after the initial peated malt shock, in the way of cinnamon, caramel malt, detergent, roastiness. The flavor was just as incredible, more of the same, but also with notes of molasses and brown sugar. The smoke is looming, booming forth like an out of control wildfire, building in a finale that is both lingering and wonderfully satisfying. Palate was full and lively. Sweetness builds in the recesses of my mouth throughout the lingering finish. An absolute masterpiece, novel and brutish, complex throughout. Im stunned, and I need more.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The aroma is so unique that Im almost wondering if I got a weird bottle.  The aroma an intense boggy peat odor.  I dont mean peated malt, I mean wet hunks of peat.  It reminded me of a wet kelp/seaweed odor, but in a pleasant way, because there were honey and smoke odors assisting.  The mouthfeel was silky and the carbonation is low.

Flavour is ""woah!"" incredibly powerful - stong malt, barrel flavoured, elixir of hops stuck to tree bark and a sugar cane sweetness that would make children crave this.

671,"2006-07-03",4.2,"500 ml bottle, thanks to Hogtownharry for the face to face trade.  Pours a  clear, gorgeous deep garnet color with a large and fluffy beigh head that leaves thick lacing as it diminishes.  Aroma is rich with dominant malts, molasses and burnt caramel with figgy and alcohol notes as well.  Flavor is sweet and rich, lots of dark fruit, a bit of roastiness, peat, a hint of maple, prominent alcohol and an interesting herbal astringency in the finish that nicely balances the sweetness.  This is a rich, full bodied beer with creamy carbonation and an overall yummy appeal!  Thanks so much Harry!","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"

671,"2006-06-12",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2009 Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention. Aroma of sweet malt with a subtle touch of peat is quite interesting. Taste of caramel, molasses and a subtle peat finish. Body is a bit thinner then expected but has a nice creamy consistency. Alcohol is very well hidden and provide a nice warming feel tot his beer. I find it hard to rate this beer while trying to remember some good (and bad) memories of the previous example of this beer. Very good for the style but not sure it is worth that much.

671,"2006-05-08",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2006 500 ml bottle courtesy of Goldorak (May 2006), consumed from a Chouffe tulip at cellar temperature.  The pour is gorgeous, a supple dark tan creamy-puffy head topping the translucent ruby-brick body, leaving thick gouts of lacing as it slowly decays.....awesomely evocative aroma of raisins and molasses, Scotch whisky, caramel, port, stunningly deep maltiness, so rich and decadent that you cant bear to stop long enough to sip; caky best-quality chocolate brownies provide more hedonism than should be allowed....and when you finally do take the plunge, you are greeted by a palette of flavors and sensations just as strong and complex:  deep sweet/burnt caramel, toasted oak chips, awesomely smooth, aged whisky-vanilla sweetness with faint hints of hoppy bitterness surrounding it all, and light alcoholic burning giving it a lovely warming, invigorating effect....sour cherries appear briefly late in the velvety soft, chewy rich miasma of liqueurish aftertaste.....if I have any problem, it is only that the burnt/charred qualities are a might too strong at the finish, causing a touch of harshness, and as Stephen mentioned, it could use a bit more smokiness (though there is a touch).

The flavour carries all of these same elements in the same quality, plus a little woodiness.

671,"2006-04-20",3.6,"Bottle (500ml).  via trade with - I think - turg.  Beautiful clear ruby-mahogany with a huge light brown creamy-foamy lasting active head - its gorgeous!  Sweet malty aroma - caramel pudding - with some yeast and light fruit - quite a bit of chocolate / chocolate toffee emerges on warming - if it were just a wee bit more robust it would be 8/10.  Taste is very malty, but a little watered-down - its sort of like a caramel apple dipped in milk chocolate, with very noticeable alcohol making for a bit of bitterness in the sweet chocolate toffee fiinish.  Mouthfeel is creamy, nicely carbonated, a little boozy ... the body is a little light.  This is a very good scotch ale, but I was hoping for great.  Ill drink more, though - but at $8/bottle its not great value for money.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
671,"2006-04-07",3.7,"Original Rating (7-3-8-4-15=3.7): Thick caramel maltiness with mild butterscotch, strong roastiness and fair fruity esters greet the nose.  Clear, ruby brown body is topped by a low tan head that recedes to partial cover with marginal lacing.  Sweet malty flavour is cut by roasty malts with some mild fruitiness.  Chocolatey sweetness lingers on the tongue.  Medium full body with moderate effervescent carbonation.  Missing the smokey characteristics Id associate with a top tier scotch ale.  Bottle sampled with MartinT, Olivier_MTL and Rastacouere.Rerate (7-5-7-4-14=3.7): Mild butterscotch, chalky roasted malts, strong fruitiness, somewhat grapey aroma with thick underlying malt character.  Almost opaque dark brown body with ruby highlights is topped by a large tan head that recedes slowly to a lasting cover with some nice lacing.  Thick, chewy caramel malts, a suggestion of oatmeal, plenty of dark pit fruits, some roastiness.  Grapiness and chalky character are present also in the flavour but not as strong as the aroma suggests.  Plenty of residual chocolatey sweetness - in fact it seems overly sweet to me once Im half way through the bottle.  Medium full body with fairly lively, yet soft bubbly carbonation, sticky texture and mild warming.  Its very good and flirts with excellence, but Im really searching for a hint of smoke and a stronger definition of the style.  Tulip glass.  Cellar temperature.

671,"2006-03-19",4.1,"This Beer was highly anticipated by all of the Québec Beer-lovin community. To make a long story short, the brewer used to make this Beer at a defunct brewery called au 4 temps in St-Hyacinthe, but closed shop about 6 years ago.  He re-opened a brewery on the Magdelein Islands, way, way out where the St-Laurence river meets the Atlantic ocean.  Being that far away, he basically has to grow his own hops, barley, etc. because shipping everything over would be too expensive.  After many years of being pestered by everyone whos ever had the original Corne de brume, he finally caved in and made another batch, and it finally made it to our doorstep.  Expectations were high on this one.

Lovely scarlet/ruby red and quite translucent, with a very nice compact, greyish head.
A big fat dose of caramel up front in the nose, followed by a surge of sticky sweet strawberry tart smelling hops that I just adore, with alcohol slowly creeping up to mellow everything out with pleasing fusels.
A big olmalt Bomb!  If it were richer than that, youd have to drink it with a fork.  A real avalanche of caramel malt, smooth but present carbonation, warming alcohol finish whos bitterness prevented the Beer from getting too cloying from the massive malt.
Just a great sipping Beer, and was worth the wait.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

671,"2006-03-15",4.3,"Pours a good looking reddish brown color, its close to ruby, the head is thick, but diminishing, and bubbly with a light brown hue. The aroma is very pleasant and appealing, theres a lot of berries in there with a thick, rich caramel malt, I couldnt find any trace of alcohol at all, which is a promise of a sturdy body. The hops seems to play the part of a supporting actor. As soon as I take a sip of this beer I think that everything will be different from now on, the legend is back. The flavor is very well balanced, its not assertive but not subtle, berries, caramel malt, delicate roasted malt and very delicate and shy alcohol vapors live in a perfect harmony, the sweetness is very present  but its just right. Again the hops play the supporting actor role.  The palate is very smooth, like a big pillow in  a liquid form resting on my tongue. The body has a medium to full thickness, the texture is creamy and the carbonation is gentle. Woof, I didnt think that Corne de Brume would reappear, and that it would make me fall in love again but its there and my heart is going wild. This feels like an opera dedicated to malt.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
671,"2006-03-14",4.0,"Clear, deep mahogany, well supported by copper and garnet reflects. The head, surprisingly dark, a profound beige, clings to the glass nicely. Intensely fruity, well extracted malt with supporting smokiness and well toasted breadiness create a charming medley for the malt addict. Gently toasty. Grapes, figs, cherries all carry their shift to protect each others backs. Heading toward roastiness at times, but stops before reaching the nut factory. Velvety texture, remarkably round for a filtered beer, focused cerealic malts, not too one-sided sweetness. Characterful, straightforward scotch ale goodness, that avoids the earthy/woody nuances that might have been interesting, but stays fine-tuned upon toffee oriented flavors. Faint support hops. Thats certainly gonna be popular in Quebec, Im anxious to see what our unbiased friends from.. (well I cant say Vermont if theyre to be unbiased), but from elsewhere think.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
671,"2006-03-13",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2009 June 09 batch:
Smoky, salty notes are more apparent, and the fruitiness has subsided. A classy sipper every way you look at it.

Newer batch (released in early 2009), on tap at Vices et Versa.
This tastes very young. Lots of raisiny esters tend to override the caramel depth. The body is also not as cushiony as it could be (which is one of the main problems in the last two batches, imho), and this time on tap, carbonation seems zealous. Overall, this was fun to try and very cleanly brewed, this is still leagues away from the Corne de Brume of old. I used to be so excited about this beers release, but the last two vintages have been outright forgettable...and at that inflated price, I dont even feel like buying one single bottle to see how it develops. Points dropping once again...

New 2007 batch, in 330ml bottles with the same label as their Écume:
Such a disappointment...A leaner body with a distinct lack of caramelization proposed roastiness and prominent leafy hop bitterness. Biscuity maltiness and light red fruit in a clean and very drinkable with very little residual sugars and an overly bitter finish. This is not going to develop residual sugars with time, so it will surely not bloom into the masterpiece that was the 2006 batch. Aroma was not more enticing than the flavor profile either. This is a mere 3.3/5 and thus a shocker of a let down considering whats been brewed before.

First batch bottled at the new Iles-de-la-Madeleine brewery 񢉖) bottled in 500ml bottles:
Any first impressions?
-Inspiring head retention, even in a chalice, over the clearest but darkest ruby.
-Humble berries in caramel sweetness form a delightful aroma which isnt up to par with the old Corne de Brume Ɣ-Tempss) version, but which is nonetheless enticing.
-The apotheosis of a red fruit ester and caramel maltiness osmosis cannot help but spell Scotch Ale luxury.
-A velvet glove massages the tongue and palate languorously; or was that the malt?

What if you dig deeper?
-Alcohol is only faintly apparent in the nose, and slightly warms in the back. It is aptly concealed.
-Delicate roasty whispers rise in the last half of the sip.
-There is amazing control and modesty in here, just pure malt flavor for the malt lover, but never exaggerating.
-Carbonation is so perfect, it is forgettable.
-Grassy hops support serenely.
-Succulence and cleanliness rarely meet so unequivocally.
What about its complexity?
-This Scotch Ale is as beautiful as a fresh strawberry. It isnt the most complex in the world, but do you look for complexity when you bite into a ripe strawberry? You look for the bursting skin, the flowing juices which will satisfy the most innocent and deepest desires. The malt (and thus the body) of this Corne de Brume will answer these marvelous prayers. To the glory of the malt!
