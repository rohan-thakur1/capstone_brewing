1141,"2016-11-27",4.6,"Thank you Mathieu87 + PriorL for the effort! Growler sampled @ Samson en Geert Bierproef Avond. Deep very bright head, very pretty bright colour, zero head, looks flat. Nose is very mineral, huge interesting mineral profile, mineral stones, strongly lactic with huge amount of raspberry pits in the background. Taste is very mineral, raspberry pits, touch watery possible due to it being close to flat, mineral stones, hugely lactic raspberry, acidic, mineral, faintest dash of vinegar, nicely puckering. Strongly lactic mineral body, near flat. Very solid, interesting, pleasantly puckering.

1141,"2016-07-07",4.0,"2015 bottle from Mr. Joenugs, shared with Nelson on 6/25/16. Thanks, Joe!Bright, light magenta-tinted raspberry body is well-carbonated and topped by a pink-tinged, light beige head that shows moderate to moderately strong retention.Raspberry is quite straightforward, with lots of flesh and seed. Vanilla creeps in, deepening complexity as a burst of phenols and leathery brett notes add livliness. No sign of the chardonnay in the nose, nor is there any strong oak, with only a touch of light wood. No alcohol or flaw.Similarly flavored, with tight carbonation and an ample, dry body. Lots of phenols and moderate vanilla with soft wood tannins and plentiful brett. The fruit is nicely attenuated as well, and leaves lots of pepper and poignant juiciness. A touch understated and quite elegant if not exactly mind-blowing.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1141,"2016-06-10",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Dougs house for a small gathering on May 01 with Travis, ebone1988, and I think Charlie made an appearance as well. Doug cracked this 375 mL bottle. Damn. The pour is a bright reddish pink color with a light pink head that falls slowly. There is a good amount of sediment to this one, thats for sure. The aroma smells like sour raspberries. There is a little funkiness and a bit of dusty barnyard to it, but the tart, sharp raspberries are the big show. The flavor is even better. There is a nice sharp fruit up front, and then it moves through a nice funky barnyard and into a sweet fruit on the back end. This one actually makes my mouth water a little, and I love it. The mouth feel is excellent. Its light and crisp with a sharp carbonation and a lovely tart raspberry finish. Im just blown away by how simple, yet excellent this is.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1141,"2016-04-13",4.1,"Sour barrel aged framboise, thanks Bart for sharing. Medium thick, off-white, more or less stable head, milky straw blonde colour with peachy hue. Complex aroma of sour yoghurt, lemo zest, starfruit, indeed sour yellow raspberry, white grape peel, raw rhubarb, sorrel, chalk, unripe gooseberry, some wet wood. Strong sour berry onset but not necessarily raspberry: some faint hints of yellow raspberry pierce through an otherwise estery, lactic and mildly citric sour whole with impressions of lime, gooseberry, starfruit and unripe green plum, softish carbo, lean pale malt body lurking underneath ongoing drying tartness and esteriness, long finish of drying acidity, fermenting hay- and yoghurt-like accents and drying wood notes. Beautiful, less known perhaps than the classic Russian River sours but certainly in the same league.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
1141,"2016-03-31",4.1,"Pours very clear... sorta orangish pink.. fizzy white head has only okay retention and leaves splotch lacing... but the clarity and color of the brew is very pretty.

Nose is better than I was hoping for.. Pungent sour notes punctuated by fantastic fresh fruit aromas all pulled together by just enough sweetness... wonderful.

Flavor has a bit less raspberry flavor because it seems to be blown out by copious amounts of bretty funk and lesser lactic/lemon notes. The raspberry is more than present though.. and seems enhanced by a minor acetic quality that isnt out of place and really adds to the fruity qualities... really not that ""sour"", just bracingly tart... later pours proved a tad tannic.. but whos complaining?

Dry and not puckering.... I think a minor bit more residual sweetness would pull this one together more .. but that is a 1% complaint... an epic brew for sure.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"

1141,"2016-02-04",4.1,"2014 bottle thanks to Bacterial from a trade close to a year ago. When I opened the box the first thing my pregnant wife said to me was ""save that one for me."" So I did, and tonight (well, Friday night) was the night. Happened to have it alongside a 2015 bottle which was fun. I was fully expecting the ""all hopped up"" character to have faded and this to be missing something, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was the opposite. 2015 was brilliant, red clear. Smelled like raspberry jam, more sweet than tart; tasted almost artificial, and reminded me about what I dont really like in some of these fruited sours. The 2014, on the other hand, was really lovely. Raspberry jam was still there in the nose, but with a full, deep, lovely wild funk to back it up. Sweetness restrained, nice tart, oaky, leathery backing. By far preferred the 2014 treatment [4.1] to the 2015 treatment [3.7]. Im rating this with the 4.1 because Im generous like that.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

The past few years have seen the sprouting of some many different and awesome sour/funky/wild/barrel aged themed breweries that Russian River has often gotten lost in the mix, even though they were one of true innovators of the sour style becoming so en vogue in America. So here we are. This beer is everything I want in an American fruit sour. Super funky while still retaining lots of fruit character. You can tell its a sour. But you can also tell what kind of fruit was used in it. Another great one here from Vinnie and the gang who helped to start it all. One day I will visit you, one day.

1141,"2015-02-13",2.5,"2014 bottle thanks to joenugs. Huge thanks for going to grab me one. Nose is pure berry and a light tartness to it, very inviting. Fruity esters play off the fruit in the beer. A light grassiness with some milky notes. Color is bright red to orange with a small tightly bubbled head. Taste is mouth puckering crazy with a bit of orange juice and a mouth watering sensation that dries out your cheeks and produces saliva at the same time. There is almost a bit of that taste right before you throw up. When your mouth starts watering and you swallow it in hopes of not puking. I have no idea what it is, but whatever I smelled is not in this beer. By the third sip, the front end of the beer become decent, while the finish is this acetic, tart mess that puckers while making me almost sick. Shit. This flavor is messed up. Even by the time my glass is halfway empty I still cant handle the finish. It has a soured milk taste to it. ugh.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

1141,"2014-01-24",4.2,"375ml bottle acquired via trade on BA. Thanks. Pours a darker tangelo orange/cranberry mix. Gentle haziness, lively strong carbonation creates lots of streaming bubbles, cakey reddish tinged head atop stays as a cakey layer, sticks around well, laces suitably. Nice winter sunset glow, dulled and darker but pleasing. Aromas present a melange of fruit, big yogurty and sour pear, melon mix in. Citrus, white wine barrel and oak. Some vanillin, gentle funkiness and cobwebs. More fruit, some raspberry pulp works in slowly as it settles down, comes alive more. Pulpy raspberry and some cranberry as it warms, more yogurt, some nice lactic acidity starts to blossom. Nice stuff. Initial is lighter end of the fold, firmer yogurty and lactic sourness hits. Some bread, oak, white wine elements show gentle honeysuckle, crab apple and melon. White grape, raspberry skin and citrus. More sourness, twangy lactic sharpness, yogurt and some seedy raspberry as we start to work in, more citrus, some nice flashes of natural lemonade, raspberry skin and seedy fruit. Really nice stuff, lighter, fuzzy carbonation lifts this a bit. Good fruit complexity, firm to strong lactic presence. The Temptation part of the blend offers some good complexity, fruit and wine barrel. Subtle brett creeps in. The Beatification element really ups the sour component though, nice and citric and lactic elements, nothing overdone. The raspberries compliment well, but do seem to fall behind that Beatification smack. Finish shows some decent raspberry, a bit of a blend between skin and seedy fruit, lingering yogurt, house funk and cobwebs. Gentle cheesecloth, white wine. Tasty, complex stuff. Nose could use the ante upped a bit, but overall this is quite nice and a nice new take on the FFAC Yearly Blend. Two different beers really come together well, seem expertly blended.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Aroma is full of bright ripe raspberries with a light funkiness and moderate acidity. Acidity adds a touch of a citrus character. Light funk reminds me of walking through a raspberry farm (yes I have done this). 
Pours a bright reddish pink with hints of orange. Medium light pink head that is moderately thick and has nice retention and lacing.
Flavor is has a light tartness right away, but that is followed by a hint of sweet raspberries. The sweetness washes away and you get hit with lots of tart berry character. light citrus acidity notes and some medium light Brett character which should develop nicely with time. Brett adds hints of barnyard and pineapple.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low acidic astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very enjoyable framboise with lots of fresh, tart fruit. The acidity and Brett character is presently more of a background character, but has the potential to develop very nicely.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
