This beer pours a small beige head that is fully lasting, transparent amber body, fizzy, fast rising carbonation, and a good amount of lacing. The aroma is malt and pine hops.

1293,"2014-09-23",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 9-8-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a nice deep amber-copper color with a huge foamy cream colored head. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading to leave a nice level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of a sweet caramel and a bit of toffee as well as some fruit smells of apple and a decent roasted malt smell. Along with these sweeter and maltier aromas is a moderately strong hop smell of a citrus and floral nature.

 Taste  The taste begins with caramel sweetness and a nice roasted malt and biscuit taste. As the flavor advances, the taste sweetens as toffee and apple tastes come to the tongue. Along with these sweeter flavors coming to the tongue, the roasted flavors dwindle, further enhancing the sweeter flavors. While the sweeter is enhanced, it is kept in check/balance by a lightly hoppy taste of a citrus and herbal nature, in the end leaving a very pleasantly balanced bitter-sweet flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the beer is on the medium side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that was on the average side as well. Both were rather appropriate for the style batching both the sweet and bitter hop flavors nicely.

 Overall Some roast, some sweet and some hop all melding very nicely. A rather enjoyable ESB.","","Darkmagus82"
1293,"2014-07-19",4.3,"The body has a rich hazy amber color with some nice visible carbonation and a light beige head on top. This head is about two fingers tall at the end of the pour and fades slowly making some nice lace patterns on the way down the glass. The aroma has some herbal/earthy/leafy hops up first with some mellow fruity/estery and light caramel like malty sweetness in the background. The flavor reflects this with a great balance or mix of bready, yeasty and fruity (apricot/peach notes) maltiness with herbal and slightly citrusy floral hops.

1293,"2014-03-30",3.4,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had an amber colored body that leaves a beautiful soft foamy yet lumpy two finger white head that lasts for at least a good two minutes. Beautiful nice lacing appears and clings nicely to the sides of the pint glass. The body is slightly hazy yet no carbonation is rising.
The smell had a slightly bland but herbal with some hops here and there, a bit of breadiness comes out in a toasty sort of way.
The taste had a soft biscuit-ness with a caramel kind of maltiness, interesting (it is an ESB, though).
On the palate, she sat at medium with a nice feel on the tongue, perhaps, close to perfect.

The slight nose is sweet citrus fruit (mango and orange) and caramel over a biscuit sweetness. The body is almost medium with a smooth texture that approaches a slight slickness. Normal carbonation with little effervescence. The flavor profile is well balanced. It begins with slight citrus sweetness, progresses to caramel and biscuit sweetness and finishes with a nice mild bitterness.

1293,"2012-10-19",3.6,"Rated 9/23. 12 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass.

A: Pours a chestnut-copper colored body with excellent clarity. The head is a two finger cream color with a nice-looking texture. Just a great looking beer in general.

S: Caramel, toffee, along side touches of hazelnut and light piny hops. This features a very earthen aroma; not the biggest or boldest, but one that does its job admirably.

T: Initially, the palate is woken up with a bright fig-like fruitiness before finishing with classic earthy, faintly piny hops. Caramel, cashew, and toffee malt flavors help round out both notes well enough on the mid-taste, striking a decent balance. The general focus here is on drinkability rather than complexity - its a beer thats easy to drink and likable without wowing the taste buds.

M: Its quite a clean, dry beer on the finish, leaving little in the way of lingering flavors and helping its drinkability, while the carbonation doesnt err too strongly one way or the other. Texture is nice, but the aforementioned finish is a hair too astringent. Otherwise, theres little to complain about the general feel.

O: The ABV keeps it out of sessioning range, but this is a good ""pair with food"" or ""drink a six pack because you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, damnit"" kind of beer. Dont expect anything mindblowing, but its incredibly solid nonetheless.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

1293,"2012-02-28",3.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/9/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Goose Island Harvest Ale  has a faded, browned copper color, hazy with a small off-white head forming on pouring. Most of the head leaves rather quickly, but it does leave a ring and a bit of spotty lace on the glass.

Lightly toasted malt, a touch of brown sugar sweetness, and a delicate blend of citrus hoppiness contribute to the nose.

The flavor starts out nicely, with a dry bit of roasted malt. It moves quickly into a citrusy hop presence and finishes there. The aftertaste is a bit bitter. Not exceptionally complex.

The mouthfeel is half creamy, half carbonated, with a fair amount of oiliness clinging to all corners of my mouth. If it is going to be that oily, at least give me a monster hop presence. Medium bodied, but it feels watery in the mouth. 

At this stage in my beer-sampling career, Gooses regular offerings, including their seasonals, just dont really make my eyes bulge. They are just could-have-been interesting and drinkable while mindlessly sipping at a BBQ or get together.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Poured into a tulip glass. Color is a moderate amber with a bit of a caramel hue to it. A bit of lacing, but not too much. The nose brings forward a good amount of light hops with some grassy and floral characteristics as well as some light citrus.

The taste brings some nice notes of caramel and bready malt underneath the hops, which are there as they were in the nose. Good balance between the two. Nice feel with a bit of sweetness as well as a bit of bitterness for balance. Drinks well and this was always a Fall favorite of mine.

Ar:  Aroma is a bit muted.  Caramel malt with a light kiss of citrus hops and a bit of grassy hops.

T: Nice caramel malt sweetness up front.  Very nice malt flavor surrounds my mouth as I swish it around.  This is very nicely balanced with a lightly bitter finish.

A - Deep amber, tawny color with a larger than average, creamy, smooth, frothy, off-white colored head. Really nice retention leaving a

S - A strong showing of grapefruit/citrus hop aroma. Some tea like hops as well. Faint pale and caramel malt as well. Intriguing and definitely not what I was expecting for an ESB or a autumn release.

T - Similar to the nose there is plenty of citrus/grapefruit hop flavor with subtle tea and earthy hops. There is more nutty and toasted malt flavors coming out mid sip. Also some caramel malt. Touches of a spicy taste. Pretty hoppy and bitter.

M - Lighter side of medium body and average carbonation. Somewhat creamy. Nice but not great.

D - Goes down quite easy. Hoppy and bitter, but not too strong.

Notes: Bottled 09/29/10. Interesting beer. Not what I was expecting from an autumn ESB. The taste was something like mixing an American IPA and an ESB or adding a lot of American hops to an ESB. Not bad and an interesting beer. Probably wont blow you away, but for the price it is an enjoyable beer. Worth a try, but not really an ESB.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Appearance: The body has a rich hazy amber color with some nice visible carbonation and a light beige head on top. This head is about two fingers tall at the end of the pour and fades slowly making some nice lace patterns on the way down the glass.

Smell: The aroma has some herbal/earthy/leafy hops up first with some mellow fruity/estery and light caramel like malty sweetness in the background.

Taste/Palate: The flavor reflects this with a great balance or mix of bready, yeasty and fruity (apricot/peach notes) maltiness with herbal and slightly citrusy floral hops. Its medium bodied and smoothly textured with a well blended mild finish.

1293,"2010-11-01",3.8,"(bottle)  Pours a very nice hazed and cloudy dark amber with a medium cream colored head that retains well.  Very hop-forward aroma, that when cold bears a strong resemblance to a Wet-Wipe napkin.  Somewhat soapy in that regard.  Further digging showcases some tangelo sweetness, light pine, orange zest and grapefruit peel.  Gets a bit resinous too.  Biscuit lurks just underneath all of this, but only meekly makes its presence known as its overshadowed by the heavy hop billing.  Flavor provides a bit more balance here, with the biscuity malt and caramel holding well against the more bitter grapefruit pithiness showcased in the finish.  Light toasted notes serve as the remnant of the finish, with some tea leaves thrown into the mix as well.  Although the finish doesnt linger remarkably long, it actually serves this beer well and provides a refreshing quality that prompts me to take further sips.  Mouthfeel really shines here, thus the 4, as it brilliantly walks the tightrope between being too thin and too full.  Carbonation is perfect too.  This beer certainly enhances my appreciation for bitters, and even though its not terribly complex, its strength lies in its simplicity.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

1293,"2010-08-01",3.2,"Deep amber and copper shimmers before me while a thin head leaves little to the imagination. Lace crawls up the sides of my taster glass, as if to invite me to indulge in her bounty. Taking up her offer, I run headfirst into a forest of pine trees, the floor blanketed in green grass damp with dew, while just over the horizon lays a grove of grapefruit trees, their limbs aching from the weight of their harvest. Apricots, nectarines, and tangerines join the mix for some fruity sweetness atop a solid backing of melba toast extra brown and extra crunchy. I dive mouth-first into her amber-coppery depths to find a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel which highlights soft golden breads. It doesnt take long though for her hops to transport me to a forest evergreen, pine trees reaching for the heavens and grass scrunching between my toes. Pine and green grass permeates her whole palate without dominating, allowing apricots and nectarines to spread their sweet juices across my tastebuds before tangerine skins cleanse my palate for the next quaff. Licking my lips, candied red apples come to mind as melba makes her presence known in the far reaches of my throat. A decent display, though not that different from most other purported harvest ales.


She could have used a little more harvest oomph and less hops. But then again, hops are an agricultural product with specific harvest times, so one could look at it as a harvesting of hops with the fruits and citrus coming in second place. Hm Another perspective to consider if I ever get to try the Goose Island Harvest Ale again.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Color is a beautiful bright copper with a fluffy white head (leaving terrific lacing).  The aroma is one of the best Ive smelled.  The hops are closer to pine vs grapefruit, but its just a soft, fresh aroma that is unlike most bitters / IPAs.  Flavor is a perfect balance of pine hops and sweet malts- previous reviews describing the taste as sweet malt with bready / biscuit undertones are spot on.  The only small knock on this one is the body- carbonation seemed a bit flat.  Took away from the overall experience just a touch.  But that aside, this is a very nice, subtle beer.  Very well made.","Colorado, USA","Dragonfly1"

A classic crystal malt-oriented pale ale with fresh hop character.

I like:
Fresh leafy, floral, orangey pale ale that explores a broad range of hop aromas and does it with s chewy, sweet toasted malt base. Sometimes, this is exactly what you want. Its been done a million times, but its a classic of the modern age. And Goose Islands savoir-faire makes it work.

I dislike:
The base sometimes feel overly bready. not very tight assemblage, a bit loose and unfocused maltiness perhaps exaggerates the crystals a bit which removes drinkability, but it remains soft textured and satisfying.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

It’s odd that GI would put out their harvest beer at the end of summer, rather than at the first hops harvest as most do, but the colors of the label and the first (American) football on the TV coincide to please me very much.  The beer inside, sadly, doesn’t quite live up.  Aroma is fairly weak --- too weak, really --- and what little there is is dominated by the fresh hops.  Appearance is lovely, however, with a nice, dark copper color and a creamy, off white head.  Flavors are also dominated by the fresh hops, a little grassy along with the bitter, with a little sweetness from the malt.  Finish is on the shorter end of medium.  All in all, not a bad brew, but not exceptional in any way.

Loses points for that, no distinct grainy-ness..more of your typical american malts for an english style. Overall, it’s tasty, but it’s not exemplary.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Vav"

Quite a pleasant surprise though there is still a large amount of sweetness throughout. Medium body and medium carbonation.

Buttered almond toffee bars flake as the stiffer caramel lining flakes off of the bitter, chalky graham cracker base. Ringing, semi numbing bitterness hits the tip of the tongue with a salty strike.

Goose Islands Harvest Ale comes as a little bit of a surprise to me as its not a wet hopped IPA or PA like the harvest ales Im used to seeing. Anyway, on to the review. Pours a faded copper that has a slight chill haze and tiny particules throughout. A two finger soapy off-white head formed on the pour and fell to a skim coat with a fatter collar. Leaves decent lace lines after each sip.

The aroma starts and ends with a moderate hop presence along the lines of sweetened grapefruit, grassiness, a hint of this and that. Maybe some lemon. The grapefruit is most prominent but all the hops are seamless to the point its hard to tell where one begins and one ends. Dont get me wrong this beer smells surpemely balanced with an earthy caramel maltinees that balances things out.

Flavor is along the lines of the aroma. Great balance between the fresh vibrant hoppiness and the caramel sweet maltiness. The flavor sports sme of the sweet pale maltiness and its very welcome. Its one after the other over and over until this beer ends up down the gullet. 

I find all of Goose Islands beers to have great mouthfeels. This is no exception. Mild carbonation keeps this beer smooth and creamy while allowing every flavor to work its way through nicely.

This is a good easy drinking very sessionable brew from Goose Island. The balance makes it one to pick up and drink the day away with.

This is a surprise of a harvest ale from Goose Island. Not the resiny one sided hoppiness like you might expect from a harvest ale but more supremely balanced and subtle making it highly drinkable.

1293,"2007-10-04",3.7,"10/04/2007:  Goose Island Harvest Ale has a nice, fresh pine hop aroma with a hint of caramel malt in the background.  This beer pours nearly perfectly.  It has an inviting transparent amber color with frothy and lasting foamy head that is dark beige (almost tan) in color and leaves adequate foamy lacing.  This beer has a medium body and is extremely smooth and drinkable.  The flavor is a very balanced blend of soft toasted and caramel malt with a satisfying hop flavor (soft pine, light citrus, and a touch of soapiness) and bitterness.  The finish is slightly dry.  One thing that I really like about this beer is the mildly sweet caramelized maltiness (tastes kind of linke crème brûlée) that shows up near the mid-palate and then lingers on the palate.  This is a really well done ESB that has become one of my favorite Goose Island brews.

1293,"2007-09-25",3.9,"On tap at Clybourn and bottled served in pint glasses: This is a combination of both reviews but honestly there is little difference between tap and bottle except head and mouth feel. The beer pours a clean coppery amber hue with an initial creamy head on tap, both the tap and bottle faded but left a small amount of bubbles and left very good  lace its wake. The aroma is shocking at first as I figured this was another classic Goose English-styled ESB but instead I found a beer with a nice fresh and citric PNW hop vapor. There is bready, slight toffee, and yeasty aromas too.  The taste does very much display Cascade notes of citric and slight piney bitters balanced wonderfully by biscuity and caramel malts. There is a light-handed spicy and woody note upon the finish. The mouth feel is sprite at first before it smoothes out towards the finish. The tap version did not display the hint of astringency found in the bottle and also seems a bit more creamer. I am rating the mouth feel based on tap.  Honestly this is more akin to an APA than an ESB but then the caramel malting makes this like a hopped up Marzen. Whatever it may be, it is a fine Autumn session brew. I will enjoy the other 5 bottles and may just need to grab another sixer down the road.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Reminds me a bit of the old GI Octoberfest before they removed the hops. The hops are subdued but very evident. More malty than hoppy, but the hops make the beer.

1293,"2007-09-09",3.3,"hot (or cool) off the shelves from friar tucks.  this beer came up big for me.  some nutmeg, carmel, ginger, and cloves mixed with a floral feel and a heavy cascade hops flavor that before today i thought only SN was capable of.  very creamy full bodied mouthfeel.","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"
1293,"2007-09-08",2.1,"A really honking beer. Bitter honking medicinal taste, Ive tasted much better ESB. This probably should be listed as an ESB. It says it it right in the description. Certainly far from a a good marzen or octoberfest. Orange brown in color and cloudy. Has an off white creamy head. Much more bitterness than any marzen Ive had the chance of tasting. One good thing is it mellows out a bit after half the bottle, probably because it numbs your taste buds. Has decent carbonation.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
1293,"2007-09-07",3.5,"12 oz bottle.   pours a rich amber with medium fine white head. aroma is strong dry hopped Northwest citrus flower  with a touch of bread. has a smooth malt character of toasted grain and  a balanced dry leafy bittreness that finishes unexpectedly smooth.  A good reason to make this another G.I . bottled beer.   thx","lisle, USA","MHED"
1293,"2007-09-03",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2007 Orange-amber color with a small white head.  Aroma is a sweet and malty with some nice floral-cirtra-pine hoppiness.  Flavor is of a nice, sweet, well-malted brew that combines a nice caramel-fresh malt sweetness with some really nice hop bitterness.  Smooth and really tasty.  Surprisingly good - not sure if it can be called a Marzen, but its better than expected.  A nice replacement for the old Oktoberfest.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
1293,"2007-09-03",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2007 Pays ""homage to the ancient Anglo Saxon observance of Haerfest,"" 12 oz. twist-off bottle, ""best when consumed by"" date on the back label (01.27.08). I was told by the beer guy at my local liquor store that Cascade hops were used in the kettle then dry hopped with Cascades again. Sampled in my GI ""Willi"" pint glass.

Poured a clear reddish orange hued copper, large rocky pale tan head, good retention, fair amount of laced sticking. Off to a good start.

The hops are the first thing I notice in the aroma, floral with pine needles and citrus. An appealing backing of toffee malts and pale grains.

Creamy smooth medium body, moderate crispness and dry in the finish. Mild, but persuasive ESB hop bitterness, pine oily and green needles, floral leafy, touches of citrus rind with some salty spiciness. Buttery and sweet malty, tastes of toffee, toasted grains and pale sugary. The alcohol is barely noticeable, just a low grade warmth in the palate.

A good, very sessional ESB, worthy new addition to the Goose Island line up.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

1293,"2007-08-31",3.2,"amber color, head is big and frothy, beige. aroma has more of citrus hop bite than I thought it would. also, a little toasted malt being more true to style. flavor is very lightly citrus with a nice toasty flavor and a bit of earthiness in the finish. pretty good. totally dig the label.","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"
1293,"2007-08-31",3.4,"Kind of an odd beer.  Pours thicks with a thick creamy head.  Smells just like their IPA with a little sweetness thrown in.  Taste is again familiar a mildly sweet caramel malt with some pines.  Upon tasting the mouthfeel is fairly thin with a citrus aftertaste.  Very ale like.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
1293,"2007-08-26",3.7,"Pour a nice bronze with a sudsy tan head.  The aroma is all kinds of hoppiness - earthy / piny / tropical / floral.  It is very clean, full and rich with some caramel / toffee malt in the back.  Medium slick body with some good soft carbonation.  The flavor starts with semi-sweet toasted malt, but that is overshadowed by the earthy & piny hops.  The finish has hop spiciness added to the mix and then a lingering sweetness from the caramel malt.  A very nicely done ale.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1293,"2007-08-25",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2007 12 oz bottle bought from Sams Wine and Spirits.  Pours amber with a beige head.  Lightly hopped nose, carmels, toasted, grapefruit/pine underneath.  Toffee carmel flavors with the grapefruit slightly coming in.  This tastes very fresh (obviously it is) and pretty good for one of my least favorite styles.  Im glad they replaced their Oktoberfest with this.  Drink it quick before the hops fade.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
1293,"2007-08-13",3.0,"On tap at GTMW.  Poured clear medium caramel with a short cap of beige head.  Aroma picked up sweet floral hoppage upfront with toasted caramel sweetness beneath.. some leafy notes and some lemon.. no major flaws, but didnt do it for me.  The flavor found lightly-toasted semi-sweet caramel and toffee at the core, surrounded by moderate-to-high floral bitterness.. didnt like whatever hops they used here.. OK balance.  Light-medium bodied with higher bitterness (and again, I didnt like the hop usage).  I was disappointed by this.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1293,"2007-08-12",3.4,"GTMW 2007.  The beer pours to a sparkling medium amber body with an average off-white head that mostly lasts.  The aroma is hay and cereal with toasted malts and grapefruit with a pepper.  The flavor is light breads, hay, cereals, and toasted malts.  Grapefruit hops.  The palate is medium-light bodied and has a dry fizzy texture with a light creaminess.  Slight astringency.  Meh.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
