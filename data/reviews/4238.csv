4238,"2015-03-15",3.9,"Draft at the source. Cloudy gold color with lasting head. Aroma is off the chain crazy. Pineapple cake indeed!! Wow... The flavor is sweet sugar upfront turning into a pineapple and sweet malt that gives a blonde cake batter. Its pretty wild that it does taste like pineapple cake, tasty and I could pound this at 5%. Just crushable if you enjoy pineapple.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

4238,"2014-03-13",4.3,"This one poured a oretty clear pineapple yellow color with a white head. Aroma was just wat I was hopeng for, pineapple, light coconut, caramel and toast. Flavor was rum soaked cake, pineappled and coconut. Not sure how they managed this one, but it was awesome.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
4238,"2013-11-22",3.6,"Had this as part of a flight at the brewery. Clear light golden pour with a small creamy white head. Pineapple, vanilla, sugar, pie crust. Flavor is big pie crust, some pineapple I guess, light malts, sweet whipped cream. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Easy drinking. Neat. Gets very sweet as you get into this one. 3 or 4 oz is enough and could be had for dessert.

I do wonder though whether these guys just squirt some flavoring into their Helles.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

4238,"2013-07-13",3.8,"Tap at CCB. Love the smell of pineapples and it actually has the cake smell to it. Pour yellow haze with a white head. Taste citrus, pineapples, very little malt which gives it the bread/cake favor. Nice beer to enjoy anytime.","Tampa, Florida, USA","DaTimBennett"
4238,"2013-06-04",4.0,"Pours golden with light haziness and a huge frothy creamy white head. Aroma brings sweet vanilla and the cake is moreso noticeable than pineapple, but it is there for sure. Flavor has big vanilla and sweet cake and pinepple notes, quite delightful. Body is not too crispy, but full for sure.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
4238,"2013-06-03",3.5,"Tap with Tom at Bainbridge. Pours hazy yellow with ok head and lacing. Notes are heavy butter, vanilla, cake, and a touch of pineapple. Light, sweet, and disappointing for me. Might have been better as a wheat ale or something. Was looking forward to this one...oh well.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4238,"2013-06-03",3.7,"Draft at Bainbridge. Pours a murky light yellow with tiny white head and minimal lace. Notes of vanilla cake batter, mild pineapple. Cloyingly sweet.","Pennsylvania, USA","tcane7"
4238,"2013-05-25",4.0,"This beer was so much fun to have!!! The pour presented a nice and slightly hazy yellow with a thin creamy head. Aroma... tons of vanilla cake and pineapple with a touch of cereal grain. The taste was sweet as well, mellow vanilla and pineapple candy. What the hell did I just drink?","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
4238,"2013-05-02",4.5,"Gold pour, white head.  Man oh man oh man.  Sometimes you read about a beer and it sounds good but never lives up to your imagination...well this one does.  Pineapple, cake, vanilla, cinnamon, cookies.  Holy shit...this is great.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
4238,"2013-03-31",4.2,"Amazing sweet cake flavor glaze, cinnamon fantastic. Very sweet, almost juice, with a slight cinnamon spiciness that really adds some depth and makes it pop.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","Rustyham"
4238,"2013-03-24",4.4,"Tap. Gold, frothy white head. Nose is huge pineapple, some bread. Taste is pineapple pound cake, light sweet vanilla. Smooth sticky mouthfeel.","","knickskicks"
4238,"2013-03-09",4.3,"Beers like this make me think cigar city are magicians. Draft at hunahpu day 2013. Pours a bright golden body with light haze and light white lacing. Aroma is vanilla cake and pineapple - scary how accurate this is. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with notes of pineapples, vanilla, vanilla cake, starchy and frosting. Insanely spot on beer-translation.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
4238,"2012-09-10",3.5,"On tap at CCB pouring up slightly hazy thin gold with white head and some spotty lacing. The aroma is very mild with sugary marshmallows and an ever so faint sense of fruit. The taste is a mix of sugary table sugar rolling oddly into some pineapple. At first this doesnt seem to work for me but the more I drink the more it is growing on me.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4238,"2012-08-22",3.9,"On draft at CCB, poured a nice light yelllow color, aromas of vanilla, fresh cut pineapple, light cinnamon, and some light malt.  Flavors are the same, not as sweet as the otherr variant, still very nice overall and very refreshing, this is a perfect beer in the Florida heat during the summer.Earlier Rating: 6/23/2012 Total Score: 4.1On draft at Cigar City poured an amazing light golden yellow color, aromas of fresh cut pineapple, light honey, vanilla, and a kiss of cinnamon.  Flavors are the same but the pineapple steals the show, very big pineapple aftertaste, really great summer beer.","Florida, USA","burg326"
4238,"2012-08-21",3.9,"Sample at the tap room. This brew pours a yellow-gold color with a medium thin white head that burns away steadily. Short strings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of fresh pineapples and malt. Light body with a pure pineapple character with touches of malt and yeast in the background. The finish is fruity with a mildly tart pineapple aftertaste. Good beer overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
4238,"2012-08-16",3.9,"On draft at Cigar City.  Pours a hazy yellow with a white head.  Nose is pineapple, vanilla, and some miscellaneous fruit sweetness.  Flavor is light malt, big pineapple, and a hint of vanilla covering any yeast of the lager.  Light in body and sessionable as hell.  I would drink the heck out of this beer if it was available regularly.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
