4320,"2014-06-18",3.4,"Transfer from BA review on 5-24-12- 
Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance- Poured a deep mahogany-brown color with a small off white head. The head faded fast with very little lacing left behind.

Smell  Sweet aromas of dried fruit and molasses mixed with a very light slightly roasty aroma of malt.

Taste  Up front there is a malty flavor with a good dose of sweet sugary flavor . These flavors form a base for the rest of the flavors to end and leave from. Right after the initial flavor a slightly nutty flavor comes to the tongue. This leaves soon after it arrives, allowing for roasty notes to come to the tongue. Toward the end the malty roast and sweet flavors mix with some light spice flavors and an ever so light bitterness. While they are slightly bitter they by no means tame the sweeter flavors of the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body is on the above average creamy side with the carbonation on the lower side. Good for the sugary and roasty flavors and higher abv of the beer.

Overall  It has some nice flavors and a good blend of sweet and roastiness. A good and drinkable brew but nothing too fantastic.","","Darkmagus82"

4320,"2013-11-18",3.8,"Bottled September 7, 2013 (2.5 months old).
Appearance: The body is a beautiful garnet hue with fine sediment in suspension of the, otherwise, clear body. The head is short and short lived, settling into a thin/sparse coating with a foamy and uneven ring. The color here is worth a 5 alone though, its a brilliant deep garnet that looks almost majestic.
Aroma: The aroma is big with dark and slightly syrupy fruits, a hint of medicinal quality as well. I get an non-descript malt sweetness as well. The aroma could use some more strength, but it smells very nice.
Taste: The intro is of brown sugar and dark fruits, this leads to a mid-taste that is nutty and a bit dry, which continues through the finish with a slight medicinal cherry flavor. The finish is dry and lingers of medicinal cherry, its mild though.
Palate: Full-bodied with mild carbonation.
Overall: This is an enjoyable beer, but I find that it doesnt have the complexity I expected from reading the description. I would have liked a strong toffee flavor along with what else is going on here, that would have made this nearly perfect.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

4320,"2013-08-20",2.6,"From a 12oz bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy reddish brown with a thin white head. Smells of Carmel, toffee, and maple. Taste is somewhat confused. It has a moderate hop-like bitterness that is a little off and which is retained from the start to the finish and lingers Dow a while thereafter. It tastes a little like cloves and the original formula Listerine, not not I a good way. The alcohol heat is very apparent and doesn't add to the experience. Not a very good example of the style.

4320,"2013-05-26",4.1,"Poured into a snifter. 2007 vintage, so somewhere in the 5-6 year old range.

3.5 A: Deep brown borderline black color. Just a short frothy head formed and fell quickly. No lacing. In any case, Im happy about the carbonation level at this point.

4.5 S: Seems that this has aged quite nicely. Still quite potent, but also with smooth, well integrated aromas. Big toastiness, dry caramel, light tobacco, and a pleasant spiciness. Dry overall, but balanced. Not a ton of complexity, but that tends to happen when a beer is aged so long. Despite this, it smells amazing.

4.5 T: Like the nose, its hard to find any problem in the taste. Lots of toastiness, caramel, and dry graininess. No hints of booze at all. Fairly dry, but again, balanced.

4.25 M: Medium body. A little undercarbonated compared to what Id expect fresh, but easily enough for a beer this age. Goes down super easy, but a bit more body and creaminess would be nice.

4.5 D: This drinks like a session beer. So easy to drink. Im furious that I dont have another. Tons of flavor, great balance, and no problems.

4320,"2013-05-12",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted, caramelized malt flavors are inherently spiced by a rye-like character, while potent wooden hops contribute as much flavor as bitterness in this complex, compelling sipper.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam covers the cloudy mahogany.
-The spicy character seems to come from grain bill and hops. It even develops a marzipan-like personality at times.
-Fruit cake allusions also appear.
-The rich body is rounded out by alcohol warmth.
-The flavor profile is harmonious throughout.
-The finish is balanced.

The flavor brings some mild hops with a bit of earth and citrus as well as some caramel. There some slight spicing and a bit of booze in there as well. The body is nice with a bit of booze and is a bit thinner than expected, but has a good amount of carbonation to carry the flavors. Drinkability is decent.

A powerful aroma of molasses remained, but the flavor had stronger elements of nuts, carbonation, and boozy fruitcake.

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint glass.

Appearance: Pours dark cherry wood color with ruby highlights and a 1 finger creamy light tan head. Minimal lacing.

Smell: Sweet and earthy malts with a touch of fruit and spice. Theres also a slight bitterness that I cant quite decipher. Aroma is a bit lighter than I expected.

Taste: Sweet malt up front followed by mild dark fruits in the middle and ending with an astringent dark leafy bitterness at the finish. Aftertaste is bitter toasted malt. The flavor is not well-balanced, in my opinion.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. The alcohol warmth is missing so I wouldnt consider this a winter warmer.

Drinkability: Okay drinkability. The harsh flavor keeps me from wanting another.

A blanket remains while a nose of treacle, plums, red apples, and cinnamon sticks finish with green grass. A bit simple, but Christmas beers have no set parameters so to each brewer their own. While the nose didnt exactly wow, her palate on the other hand does a better job of stimulating my senses. The hops which were but a background whisper are now front-forward and prominent with green grass and pine needles crushed between fingers, their sticky resins oozing rich forestry esters. Chocolate delights flow underneath while a dry finish atop my tongue is all bark and dry forestry wood. Quaff and repeat. Overall, a bit more stimulating than her nose, resulting in a sessionable Christmas beer which neither disappoints nor inspires.

4320,"2010-04-07",3.4,"A nice Winter Warmer that fits the style well but doesnt particularly excel in any category. Old Jubilation has a nice appearance, deep brown liquid with a good beige head. The aroma is predominantly light malt with a metallic tinge. Its not bad but a bit weak. The taste is somewhat boring caramel malt with good spicing and a lightly bitter finish. The spices are particularly well done with clove and cinnamon dominant and never take on the annoying artificial character of so many other beers in the style. Unfortunately, Old Jubilation just fades into the background of my winter warmer memories. Its well done but a bit boring. I would recommend it to fans of the style or those looking for a simple entry point to winter warmers (of course, the latter seems like a bizarre audience that I just invented).","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

English barleywine-esque. No hops really present, though a nice nose. Likeable in my book. [A] Shotgun blast and huge huge chunky bubbly brown head. Caramel brown to light. Active. Will not even allow a pour. Dont think this is 07. Dark ruddy brown liquid. [F] Initially dark fruit. Caramel and a very large chocolate note. Mostly fruity. Nice intricacy and balance. Licorice. Maltiness. [P] Very watery. No hops. Flat mouth. With more dark fruit and chocolate. Reminiscent of certain barleywines and foreign stouts. Not especially a bad thing for this ale.

First taste reminds me of an English barleywine. Tons of malt come through ranging from flavors of brown sugar to smoked malt and even some copper. Hops are also there, slightly bitter but mostly floral and earthy. Alcohol adds a touch of warmth to the finish.

Mouth feel is good. Carbonation is sufficient. Beer is medium bodied, about average consistency for a winter beer. Wish head contributed more to body, it died down towards last quarter of glass.

The beer pours a reddish brown with a relatively good head of foam that hold up well.

The aroma is tart cherry, currents, malt, and a wisp of alcohol. A great smelling beer.

The Cherry and Currents in the aroma take of the beginning of the taste, and remain for quite a while, then you pick up a good dose of malt, and the taste ends with a mild burn (as would be expected in a Winter Warmer), and a good dose of bittering hops. Wow

Smells of strong caramel, cocoa, candied nuts, dough, and hints of light roasted malt at the end of sniffs.  The taste is nice and clearly malt-driven, with a lot of toffee, brown sugar, and prunes, that then switches to a nice and lingering finish of toasted nuts, toffee, and kicks of spice.

Aroma is both soft and hard. The softness comes from a good amount of dark fruits and prunes, sugary berry malts, and toffee. The hardness comes from the balancing woody hops, somewhat toasted notes in the sweet toffee, some almost sharp licorice, and a nice boozey touch. The flavor is very enjoyable. Much more of a noticeable roast and toasted toffee flavor. The nuts that the brewer proclaim are distinguishable in the flavor when they were not easy to pick up in the aroma. The licorice, prunes, and berry malts from the aroma are present, but not sugary at all. There is a slight woody character to this near the finish as well. The finish is very even and somewhat dry. It leaves a very nice nut, roast, wood, and toasted toffee lingering flavor that lasts for quite awhile with just a hint of alcohol creeping in. Palate is full and flavorful.

Updated rating on 8/6/09 (originally rated on 1/7/09):  Pour still produces a decent head.  More malt in the nose than I recall.  Slightly sweeet aroma.  Flavor has improved.  Great balance of toffee malt and pleasant hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel seems to have improved as well.  Overall I bumped this up from a 13 to a 15.  Its very good now.

A modest caramel malt scent and a little bit of toffee and molasses.  It was a dark, but clear copper-brown color with a big, foamy, off-white head that was quite thick with good retention and slight cling.  It had a brief sweet fruity taste, that quickly became bitter and somewhat sour in the mouth, becoming more bitter and alcoholic as the beer went.  The beer was pretty wet with some good fizz and a medium-density body.  The present of alcohol was noticeable throughout and it had a dry finish that was somewhat rough.

Smells actually rather fruity with a bit of dark roasted coffee cutting through.

Tastes of a dark fruity almost prune-like flavor with a very hoppy finish. Hoppy and spicier than I expected from a winter warmer. Many complex flavors, too much for my novice taste buds to pick up.

Overall an excellent brew, and was a great way to warm up after coming inside in an Ithaca blizzard. Warms me right up. Probably could be a little less hoppy, but that’s just my taste.

The different flavors dont synergize like they would from a ""great"" beer. It seems that Avery gets so close to that world-class level without actually breaking through to it. They made very good beers, not ""great"" beers, in my humble opinion. As is the case here.","California, USA","Gypsy19"

Wonderful aroma. Again, reminds me of cherries though perhaps that is what theyre calling the hint of hazelnuts. More than a hint to me. VERY nice flavor. Not overly hoppy and on the malty side for sure. Definately taste the hazelnut flavor they talk about. Not cloyingly sweet. Lightly roasted malts hang around on the pallate. Hides the 8% alc. well in its body, though as the beer warms up it does come out a little more pronounced. Overall, Id definately put this on the buy again list.

Man, this is good stuff.  This is the best winter beer Ive tried in a while.  Still like the Celebration Ale from SN better but hey, Im a hophead.  Still a solid-ass beer from a brewer that seems to be coming on.","Huron, Tennessee, USA","Tilley4"

4320,"2007-12-23",3.5,"Pours a nice mahogany with a creamy beige head that stays around a while before it diminishes, leaving only a thin cap at the surface and creamy lace marking its retreat. The nose is a round malty front with a backing of earthy and lightly spicy hops. Medium-bodied with creamy, soft carbonation, the palate segues to a tight bitter finish and a touch of alcohol on the exhale. A solid, toasty malt front transitions to a well balanced, moderately hoppy finish. (Behind the big, malty body, I cant distinguish any specific hop variety, but their unmistakably bitter presence is a nice component of the finish.) This is a fairly tasty holiday ale. Ill have to hide a few bottles away to see how well it cellars.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

The flavor starts rich, malty, and complex: maple, toffee, chocolate, and roasted grains. A mild hop bitterness begins to balance the maltiness around mid-palate. The finish is dry and roasty - and very bittersweet. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and very creamy.

Finish: Creamy, cocoa power and long with sizeable alcoholic warmth

The pour is a very unique, dark brownish-purple color with a 1"" frothy off-white head.  Lacing was very good all the way down the glass.  The aroma was complex, with notes of dark malts, oak, candied pecans, dark rum, and mocha.  The flavor was less complex, but equally impressive.  Chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, hazelnuts, and a nice hop bitterness were all present.  This beer reminds me of a porter mixed with an English Ale.

4320,"2007-06-03",3.8,"Im somewhat shy about this whole Winter Warmer category; a category filled with beers flavored with spices, bush berries, and twigs. Yet, as Ive enjoyed the other Avery products Ive tasted, I thought Id give this one a try. Here we go!

Appearance: Pours a rich garnet hue with a modest, yet persistent tan head.

Aroma: Sniff! Gobs of sweet malty goodness upfront teamed with hints of caramel and mystery dark fruitiness. Also: a playful, leafy hop bouquet once you get past the malts.

Taste: Alright, lets jubilate! I get a Malt Mouth with light cocoa powder, caramel, and with a dash of light coffee thrown in. The hops lazily file in at the back of the line, allowing the beer to finish with a pleasant, albeit lingering hop flavor. Theres also a tiny bit of smokiness to be found. The 8% alcohol goes undetected, and was well hidden within this brew. Delish! Just the right amount of sweetness for me.

Mouthfeel: I would say medium for the mouthfeel with this one, and theres a decent amount of carbonation, too. Smooth! Which leads us to...

Drinkability: Oh, its drinkable alright! Especially for the 8% alcohol. Absolutely a joy to drink, even without the spices, bush berries, and twigs present in so many of these seasonal offerings. A hefty brew, and certainly a tasty one, I am pleased to have given this Avery offering a try and look forward to the remainder of the six-pack. Way to go, Avery!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
4320,"2007-06-01",3.7,"Pours a dark deep red brown to mahogany with a healthy light tan head.  Dark malt abounds not necessarily sweet or roasty though.  Distinctively nutty.  Some dry dark bitter chocolate and a god hint of alcohol.  A light though creamy mouthfeel.  Perhaps a bit soapy, low carbonation.  The flavors are a bit more confusing than the nose.  For starters, the roast is much more noticeable. A good bit of chocolate and nuttiness also in the flavor.  Maybe some chicory or even light coffee?  Rather dry, the alcohol is well hidden too though.  Perhaps a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, but only a hint.  Something woody and maybe even a touch oaky, minus the cherry hints.  Dry tannins linger on the tongue.  Dry roasty finish, with a bit of charcoal.  Lingers like a stout.  Almost like a big in your face dry porter.  This got better as I drank more of it.

Powerful carbonation inside the glass. Drinkable and lightly warming. Only wish it were fuller, but its still a hearty brew. Aroma has a thick malt scent with some grassy yeast.

Looks great, dark creamy head on dark red body. Smells sweet and sticky, some dried fruits maybe. I was unprepared for the taste - its huge. Very unsophisticated, and unbalanced. Even the unsubtle explosion of malt and hop tastes fails to cover the strong alcohol taste. Yet another US charicature of a UK style not done very well. Didnt leave any though, so not that bad.

Very rich, amazing feel on the palate. I just got some old school bubblegum, you know the rock hard sticks of bubblegum that came in Topps baseball card packs in the late 80s?

Pours a dark walnut brown with a thick two finger head. The foam settles slowly to a very thick cap that leaves behind a solid sheet of lace.

Smell; piney hops are the first to hit me, with little bit of citrus mixed in. Theres dark roasted malts that come off as a bit burnt, but also with some chocolate and caramel.

Taste; the dark chocolate, caramel and roasted malts come to the fore in the flavor. The pine and citric hops are there, they just take mare of a complimentary role instead of a dominant one as they did in the aroma. The hops and roasted flavors mix very well with a bit of a spicy alcohol presence in the finish, making for a very tasty beer.

Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium bodied, and very smooth, with a bit of alcohol in the finish giving it a bit of a drying character. Drinkability is really good, especially if you like lots of roasted malt flavors.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

Taste is very peaty with a tang of iron to it, roast malt, peach pit and herbal/funky hop bitterness - surprisingly bitter finish.  Average body, very astringent, almost burnt sugar character on the palate, where it lingers quite a while, alcohol dryness to it.  Very good beer, nice take on the style.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

The taste starts off sweet and chocolatey, then it turns slightly alcoholic, and then bitter.  The aftertaste is clinging, just a little bit bitter.  Not a great aftertaste.  It feels a little too thick for my liking.  It has more of a stout feel than an ale, but not bad.  Pretty impressive beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","animal8788"

I wouldnt have guessed this was 8% when drinking.  Sweet flavor with a hint of hops.  Interesting that in the commericial description they mention that there are no spices used.  Could have fooled me.  Would have scored higher with a more detectable aroma.

4320,"2007-01-06",3.2,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 I held on to this bottle for about a year because I got it from a six pack of identically themed winter themed beers, all promising to warm me up on a cold, snowy night.  That line had become so trite and cliché that I just pushed the rest aside and let the biting winter cold finally take me.  Somehow I survived until morning despite not having another winter warmer from the six pack, and I vowed that as much carping and captious tom-foolery as I might throw it I should give this ale the same chance that I had given the others.  A little more than 365 days later I did, and I was treated to something familiar in its regularity.  This whole genre of beers is what fiber does to the digestive track  it becomes predictable to a letter.  I dont even want to go into the same old, same old character and quality.  It has no head, its ruby red, it smells like pine long dead, the smell is lead, with resin bled, and licorice for street cred.  There, I feel a little bit better now.  Its all true, mind you.  Old Jubilation is sugar on a rampage, adhesive with sugar molecules and nigh organic with its gargantuan pine resin presence.  The only other flavor here is chemicals from a carpet cleaner, which needless to say is not a pleasing thing to have on the tongue.  Im still bent on the idea that drinking medium to low quality brews is helpful for my abilities as a Ratebeerian, but this style clearly has come cookie-cutter issues that need to be resolved, or better yet, absolved.  Just cut down on the quantity of beer that tastes almost exactly the same.  I appreciate all the wonderful and diverse label art, but it seems like it ends up being the same suds in every one.  And as for the whole winter warming idea?  When theres a centurion legion of beers out there that can do it and do it with style Im likely to go stand by them in the presence of a fireplace then make the best of it with a beer that tastes like everything else that it shared its shelf with.  Again, its not the flavor Im upset with.  Only the repetition of the same flavor.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Palate is medium, moderate carbonation, and creamy with only a slight alcohol warming near the end.  Being from Colorado, this is an excellent winter warmer for the cold late fall, early winter nights with friends or family.  Not spectacular, but simple, original, and fully satisfying.  After over a year in the cellar...  Appearance is still great,  Nose is similar but now picks up some dried fruits, cellar notes, and the hops have become somewhat resinous.  Flavor remains similar but hops are less dominant towards the finish.  Body is better with a medium-full body and a more round mouthfeel.  I like the palate and the new intricacies of the aged bottle but the hops are great in the fresh version.  Its a very good winter warmer frsh and aged.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Despite the fact that my previous rating was very favorable, my recollection of Old Jubilation is that it was less than memorable. My ratings this time around all plummeted: Ar 6, Ap 3, Fl 7, Pal 4, Ov 15. Overall impression is that its alcohol and malt with nothing overly distinctive about it. A nice beer, but not worth the extra dough I spent when I could have had an Avery the Reverend on tap or better yet, another Town Hall brew.

4320,"2006-06-18",3.9,"18-Jun-06 (12 oz bottle: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA Im not quite sure why I thought this was a barleywine two years ago, maybe having ""Old"" in the name threw me off, but it clearly doesnt fit that style.  This particular bottle has been aging in my cellar for well over a year, and its showing positive signs of that maturation.  Its very earthy and roasty, toasty, sweet, chocolaty, smoky in the finish, and moderately bitter throughout.  The beers earthiness is fairly prominent in the nose too, where a pleasant toastiness takes hold as well.  Toast and chocolate definitely take a back seat in this area.  Full bodied but not syrupy in any way, and the bitterness balances the sugars, preventing the palate from cloying.  Medium ruddy-brown in color with good clarity.  A good inch of beige-colored head forms on the pour, taking many minutes to settle to a thin, persistent layer.  The significant amount of lacing covers the glass in a doily pattern that will likely persist until I wash it off the glass.  Clearly this beer is capable of a year or two of aging, though Im not sure there is too much change to the overall flavor profile.  A great beer when fresh, and equally great when aged, so buy a sixer and dont worry if it takes you a year or more to drink it.02-Mar-04 (12 oz bottle: OBriens in San Diego, CA) A very malty and earthy barleywine that goes easier on the heavy, syrupy sweetness and results in more balance that is typical of the style.  Moderate bitterness right from the start, but the hoppy bitterness gains prominence in the mildly smoky finish.  The beer has a nice, thick palate initially, but the hoppiness at the end cuts in dramatically.  Aroma is light but mostly that of sweet malts.  The color is a gorgeous ruddy mahogany, clear and sediment free.  Head is very light-tan in color, smallish, but has fairly good retention.  Very intricate lacing pattern resembles the window pattern of a high rise building. (6, 4, 8, 4, 17 = 3.9)","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

An expected strong dose of caramel malt, with a lack of hop balance. Two phased, this beer begins with a bright, chipper vanilled brown sugar malt, morphing into a mellow, christmas cookie and marshmallow run.

6 pack from Liquor Galaxy. I always wondered why I had such an affinity for this beer so I decided to revisit it. The answer, Im not sure. I guess my taste has changed over the past few years, but this is just okay and Im ready to move on after one bottle. I do like that it is a little unique compared to all the other winter specials on the shelves this time of year. The malty nose is very nutty with hints at vanilla, mocha and alcohol. Full malty body with flavors that could possibly lead the drinker to believe spices were used, but nothing quite on the level of an adjunct. Yeah, its a pretty good beer and Ill probably have it again in the future. But Im not nutso about it.

[Bottle, Oct 13, 2007] Im not exactly sure why, but  I do have a soft spot for this stuff.  There is a bit less hops than I remember, but many interesting, subtle spiced notes. Im impressed that no spices are used, because I get definite hints at nutmeg and cardamom. A thin, juicy berry-like flavor is noted along with a pleasant chocolate-esque finish. Its a nice change from the usual winter warmers, but very appropriate for the season.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

The body is full and chewy, weighed down by lots of nutty and woody malt.  The yeast adds some fruitiness to the heavy body, giving it a great complexity.  Seems young now, would like to tuck some of this away for Christmas next year.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

4320,"2005-10-28",3.9,"One of the latest effects of the change in the ABV limit law in Georgia in 2004  is the major increase in availability of good domestic micro brewed beers, one of which I poured in my oversized wine glass tonight.  Avery Old Jubilation came is a longneck brown bottle with a wintry scene on the label.  The poured beer looked clear, chestnut brown, with a tinge of red.  The head was dark beige, and formed quite nicely to a one finger thick foamy consistency before fading away to a covering of bubbles.  The aroma was accentuating the malts in a big way with a sweet, musty, roasty smell.  The hops were there as well, but provided more of a floral background smell.  The taste was much more of a balance between hops and malt, with a stronger than anticipated leafy bitterness reminiscent of tobacco juice.  The malt was a mix of brown sugar, toffee, chocolate, nuts, peat smoke, and dates.  The mouthfeel was silky smooth and rich with a sticky quality to it.  The aftertaste was like a lingering peat flavored candy.  The alcohol content was well hidden behind the subterfuge of all this complex layering, with no noticeable burn.  A good seasonal offering from the Colorado brewery who can do big beer right most of the time, and this is one of those times.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Initially, I notice the roasted malts and some nice hops. After a few gulps you get some hints of wood and toffee. All in all, I kind of wish it was either a little smoother or a little more defined. On the other hand, I do enjoy the way it clears your palate and doesnt leave a big aftertaste.

4320,"2004-12-05",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2010 I am drinking this in June which is something like six months too late but this says its cellarable for two years so my rating it is still fair, right? This business pours garnet amber w/ a huge head or mixed bubbles that dissipates fast. The nose is nutty, lightly sherry-like and oxidized--quite nice. W/ a medium body and slight stickiness this might come across as too heavy but for some very vigorous carbonation, perhaps too much so. Fruit and coffee-like notes come out as the beer warms. I wish more Christmas beers were like this. I like spices fine but I like beer better. This is a nice, strong winter warmer and a beer through and through. My rating from years ago happens to be the same but the individual number have been adjusted.

Original rating: Dark garnet with a creamy ring of off-white head. Wonderful nose with a bit of malt, toffee and pine. The flavor comes across as slightly woody and astringent with an odd earthy note. Despite this the mouthfeel is creamy and full with carbonation like some of the best Belgians. Alcohol is very apparent and with some of the rough bitter notes makes this much less drinkable than it would be otherwise. It does also add a pleasant warming sensation though. 3.6","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

4320,"2004-12-03",4.3,"This one pours a dark mahogany color with a good-sized tan head. The head retains for most of the beers life and leaves rings of lace around the glass that melt away. Sweet malts are in the air with this, dark fruits, caramel and molasses are the main contributors to this sweet aroma. There is also slight earthy hop notes appearing here and there as this one was put down. Taste mimics the aroma in most ways with the sweetness hitting you first and strongest with the same fruity and caramel malt flavors with an earthy hop tone keeping it from being overly sweet. As this one warms and you consume more subtle complexities start coming out with various spices and flavors coming forward. There is a slight bitterness to the finish and a pleasant lingering taste as well. Excellent mouthfeel here with every sip covering your mouth with a thick, rich and creamy taste. Drinkability is high as well as only trace signs of the high alcohol content can be found in this. Highly recommend for the strong ale lovers out there. Another surprisingly great brew from Avery, but at this point in not as much a surprise.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"

Bit of roastyness, more pine and hops.  Very well balanced and very easy drinking.  Hardly notice the 8% at all.  Finish is smooth with good bitterness.  A very good seasoal ale.

Not a whole lot of aroma but the taste makes up for it.  Very sweet and spicy with underlying citrus flavors. Decent hopping kicks in towards the end of the first taste. Not especially heavy and I didn't notice any untoward alcohol taste.  This could easily become a favorite of mine, especially for the price ($6.99 per six pack at Brennans in Madison, WI).","Wisconsin, USA","NeonLX"
4320,"2004-02-29",3.2,"This beer was sampled thanks to the kind heart of beerguy101. This one poured a cranberry/cherry color with a slight head with patchy bubbles...the color a slight hint of tan. The aroma effervesced cranberries and orange peel with big smacks of maple syrup. Canada would be pissed if they knew how much maple syrup aroma went into the making of this. There's also a hint of tea leaves in the aroma. The taste smacks of a few spices, something on the order of ginger, and a heavy dose of oranges and lemons. Some hints of sweetening malty qualities come in near the end, but not enough to truly make an impact. Something was left to be desired, but still enjoyable.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

4320,"2004-02-01",3.8,"Nice deep translucent firey glowing brown color, thin sandy colored head thats firm and crusty only to fade somewhat quickly to a semi-fluffy thick collar, lace in minimal strings and spots. Aroma is quite roasty, dry and coffeeish with a nice malt tone thats a touch sweet. Which becomes more evident as it sits, plus some alcoholic warmth seeps through as well once it warms; quite nice with a bit of added dried floral hop notes too. Taste has a warm roasty maltiness thats a tad sweet, touches of spice, molasses, and a favorable little coffee-like dryness and mild dried leafy hoppyness. The only thing is thats its a wee bit flat and doesn't last for very long. The finish has a nice light effect of sweetening dryness. Feel is just shy of medium body with a thinner side to its creamyness. If this weren't 8% this could be one fine dandy session of an Old Ale, but that detours it a bit from being so, other then that its still fairly drinkable.

Start malt sweet and slightly oxidized. Earthy hop and wax hints poke through here and there  over a glazed malt and apple skin topping. Finishes long with a plethora of meaty malts and vague leafy hops along with a resilient caky, dark fruit malt charge. Subtle sherrylike twang hangs on with rich malts and black currants.

What does Avery have against bottle conditioning???  Well anyways, it smelled pretty good, a mild cherry aroma, some drier nutty flavors and a touch of alcohol.  Almost no head, but ends up with a ton of lacing.  I really enjoyed the lack of spices, it was a nice change on the winter beer.  Didnt know what to expect (which is a feeling I love having going into a beer).  Opens up with a big flavorful cherry-caramel malt that is soft, and very balanced.  Some dry nutty flavors make their way in, I wouldnt have guessed hazelnuts, maybe walnuts, but whatever, it adds a nice element of complexity.  Finish ends with a dry roasty appeal and some alcohol.  Aftertaste was a bit odd, that weird avery hops thing coming in, with some acidic/bitter hops.  I could actually see the flavor melding together better after another year or so.  Body is medium and has a soft/lightly syrupy, chewy texture with a good amount of carbonation.

The Gods of beer were extra special to me for sure, maybe as a reward for not drawing from my holster the old Colt 45 Six-Shooter and popping off a few of the ID10Ts, that invest the streets of Phoenix.

The beer projects a translucent deep brown color, the head piled high supported by the glass, all frothy and light tan, the lace a filmy sheet draped over this gorgeous temptress of the brewers art. The floral aroma of the hops greets you first, followed by the sweet malt; also I sense a hint of alcohol, brandy like a better description, this nose a portent of things to come for the lucky imbiber of this brew. Front is ambrosial and thickly malted, the top full and round, the finish devilishly acidic and the hops also Mephistophelian in their spiciness, dry and lingering aftertaste that ends this   superexcellent beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

4320,"2003-01-08",3.9,"This was just delicious.  Thick, semi-sweet, good amount of  hops.  The best part was the finish - dry, dirty and nutty.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
4320,"2003-01-08",3.0,"Clear mahogany body wuth small beige head.  Aroma is caramel, malty, slightly sweet and slightly roasty.  Flavor is chocolate with nice coffee bitterness.  Finish is a bit roasty, and a bit cloying.  Medium body.  Tasty, but nothing special.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
4320,"2003-01-08",3.9,"This beer pours a deep, clear, dark brown color with a small, lingering tan head. It has a strongly nutty malt aroma. Full bodied, flavor is malty up front, with some nuttiness and caramel tones. Finish is sweet and slightly nutty with some hop bitterness present, but not much. Alcohol is well hidden.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"
4320,"2002-12-23",3.1,"Dark red, with a nice thick head that stuck around for a while. Spicy/hoppy aroma.  Malty, a little caramel. Not a very strong taste. Not a bad beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"
4320,"2002-12-21",2.9,"WAY TOO HOPPY!!! This is supposed to be an English Strong Ale? Could have been 20-30 IBUs less. Overall an enjoyable beer but they need to lay off the hops cause this was more bitter than the IPA.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"
4320,"2002-12-21",4.1,"Deep clear cherrywood color underneath a smallish tan head.  Nice earthy hop aroma accompanied by toffee and roasted malt.  Nice body and depth of flavor.  Roasted malts, earthy hop flavors, nutty and toffeeish.  Finish strikes a good balance between deep malt and bitterness.  Overall very good.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
4320,"2002-12-19",3.6,"Very malty and smooth aroma with a nice sweetness. Dark brown-red with lacing off-white head. Low medium carb and medium watery body. Nice malty character, hoppy but not too bitter. Molasses/fruity taste, with nutty finish/after. Good taste and not too sweet.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
4320,"2002-12-17",3.5,"The aroma is of fuit malt and nutmeg. Thick and smooth drinking.  The alcohol is non detectable.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","MikeF"
4320,"2002-12-15",3.6,"Complex malt, by turns nutty, sweet, fruity smoky and spicy and all very nicely integrated under a delicate hop nose.  Not brilliant, but a tasty tipple.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
4320,"2002-12-13",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2006 Rerate: Medium beige head, dark amber color. Sweet toffee, chocolate and hop aroma. Flavor is sweet, bitter, nutty and some alcohol. Finish is bittersweet. Seems to have alot more hops this year.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Darkover"
4320,"2002-12-09",3.8,"Deep red color, nice head.  Sweet hoppy aroma.  Flavor was balanced expertly with a sweet finish.  As it warmed, I got notes of cereal in the finish.  A good beer but nothing to make it stand out too much.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
4320,"2002-12-08",3.8,"Dark mahogany color, nice head.  It was like a weaker version of the Sweetwater Festive ALe I had two beers before: sort of a ginger taste but lighter.  Nice, somewhat bready finish.  not bad!","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
4320,"2002-12-07",3.5,"I would most likely give this higher  marks, but like an idiot Im drinking while still trying to get over a cold. It does seem to have some medicinal qualities in the strength. Nice malty - the strenghth does come through a bit. I had wondered, not seeing it on the bottle, but here. Look forward to having another with  a clear head.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
4320,"2002-12-06",4.2,"Nice clear, deep brown.  Nose malty, smells quite strong.  Odd soapiness, but doesnt overly detract.  Great sweet malts, nutty, chewy, toffee-ish.  Sugar somewhat reminscent of Belgian candy sugars.  Slightly mineral in the finish.  Oddly sour at the end, but it doesnt cause problems with the enjoyment.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
4320,"2002-12-06",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2003 This beer mega-macadoscious rocks!!!
The aroma is of rich malt, dark fruits and chocolate.
A crystal clear, deep mohogany color. Handsome.
God, I'm a geek. I just called a beer handsome... and it's not the first time.
The flavor is to die for. Malty and slightly sweet up front. Well-balanced with a whisper of tartness and bitterness on the backside.
Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel. Lively carbonation. Medium-length, slightly acidic, mostly dry finish.  Incredible beer! English Strong Ale? Ehhh!!! I'm not the categorizing expert that those who run the site and brew the beer are, but this brew reminded me of a Belgian Dubbel. Whatever. Drink one.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
4320,"2002-12-05",4.1,"Very very good.  An excellent blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and ginger blended with a nice orange citrusy flavor.  Definitey a close 2nd when it comes to winter brews - Barleys still being the best.","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","bluemeow76"
4320,"2002-12-05",3.9,"Found at Jungle Jims in Fairfield, OH. Averys brews have all been pretty good so far and this is no exception. This is a pretty good seasonal ale to boot. Pours a pretty amber color with a medium thin beige head. Spicey aroma of connamon and hops. The flavor was a mixture of malts, brown sugar, cinnamon etc and was surprisingly rich. Good stuff!","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
4320,"2002-11-27",4.1,"Dark reddish color with a smallish head. Caramel malty nose. Flavor is predominately caramel malt, and quite sweet. Has a crisp bitterness in the finish, and a nice blend of what seem to be slightly citrusy Cascade hops and another bittering hop--Fuggles--giving it a slight nod to English old ales.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
4320,"2002-11-17",4.0,"Quintessential holiday ale.  If there is a definition of what an American holiday ale is supposed to taste like, then this is it.  Warm, red, spicy, cinnamon like, its all there.  I would not want to drink this all year round, but at this time its just right. BTW - i had no idea that this was 8% until I saw it here, after drinking it.  Rating just went up.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
4320,"2002-11-14",3.6,"Nice and dark with a crimson hue; sticky lace patterns. Sugary - with a hint of spice - aroma. Roasted brown sugar malt flavors. Spices are subtle, blending well with the bitter hops in the finish. A little tangy in the finish also.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
4320,"2002-11-12",3.5,"i dont usually enjoy the roasted flavor/aroma in beer.  this did however have an appealing mouthfeel.  very sweet at the begining with a bitter roasted finish.  the hops of which i am a big fan were very much present throughout the taste.","flint, Michigan, USA","hotbod47"

4320,"2002-10-17",3.0,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2014 2014 bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white to light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel, nuts), lightly hoppy (apricot), lightly yeasty (dough). Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.  Rather quiet nose this year, caramel and not much else. Sweet and fairly syrupy in the mouth, drinkable but barely. Kinda surprised that even the brewers like this as-is...seems phoned in this year.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4320,"2002-10-12",4.0,"(Bottled 9/26/02) Beautiful deep brown color. The nose is malty, nutty, and spicy. The palate is rich and fairly well hopped. A complex, nutty and roasty ale that will warm my winter.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
4320,"2002-06-01",3.5,"Great chocolate aroma.  The flavor continues along with a slight fruit flavor from the aroma hops.  Good but could be a little smoother.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","scrawfis"
4320,"2002-04-06",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2005 re-rate-one of my first ratings on the site-had to go back and have this again at falling rock taphouse-Denver, Co.  pours a deep ruby red hue with a beige head.  good lacing!  hops-citrus and piney with caramel and toffee tones.  i didnt get these nutty and mocha notes.  I did in the 2001 batch, but not this one.  more hops than anything else.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
4320,"2002-02-08",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2012   I actually really enjoyed this beer. Totally different from anything I have ever tried...tasted like a combination between a Scottish Ale and a barleywine to me. Dark color with a large head. Nutty, burnt flavors in the thick, toasty malt, hoppy and well balanced. ABV comes through a little powerfully, but still a nice change of pace. Finishes with a burnt coffee note. Warming. Retaste- I got a lot of fireplace smoke and black licorice on the palate. Still one of my very favorite holiday beers.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
4320,"2002-01-23",3.2,"something bitter in the aroma that i just didnt care for, but the taste made up for it...for me, the taste of cold coffee was overwhelmingly obvious in the finish","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"
4320,"2001-12-31",3.8,"gentle pour produces a half inch head; good lace.  gorgeous orange brown color, brassy highlights at about pantone 1525.  aroma is hoppy citrus fruitcake, and a convivial taste to boot.  you just want to go out and jubilate!  i dont know if these hops are kent goldings, cascades or peter cottontails, but if they poured just one bottle of this in with a vat of miller highlife,  the miller would be substantially more drinkable-- however, the jubilation would be seriously damaged.  classy beer for hopheads.  an the 8% alkeehol packsh a little punsh too, hic...","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
