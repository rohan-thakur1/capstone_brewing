3920,"2017-02-13",3.8,"500 ml bottle. The beer is a dull orangey pink magenta color, fairly light. A bit hazy. Smallish white head, sorta fizzy. Pleasant berry-forward aroma. Both raspberries and cranberries come through well, and its a good combo. Mix of sour and sweet fruitiness. Moderately strong lacto note. A touch of buteriness but its pretty far in the background and not bad. Tiny bit of cheesy funk. Taste isnt as tart as expected. Only moderately sour. Berries arent quite as sweet as the aroma suggested. Theres a welcome woody berry flavor. Pretty dry finish. A little more butter. Light, fizzy feel. Its a pretty simple beer, but whats there is enjoyable. Good fruit flavors.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3920,"2017-02-12",3.4,"On tap at Toolbox, pours a hazy pinkish amber with a small white head. Aroma brings out tons of tart raspberries upfront, with cranberries further back and wild yeast underneath. Flavour is a mix of cranberries and raspberries, with moderate tartness.

Pours hazy pink/reddish orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big tart/sour raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, lemon, green apple, red grape, wheat, cracker, hay, straw, light lacto funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/acidic yeast, berries, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart/sour raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, lemon, green apple, red grape, wheat, cracker, hay, straw, light lacto funk, and yeast earthiness. Moderate fruity/lactic tart/sourness and tannic berry notes on the finish; with lingering notes of sour raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, lemon, green apple, red grape, wheat, cracker, hay, straw, light lacto funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, berries, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/sourness balance, and zero astringent/puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from sour/tart/tannic notes as well. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately acidic/tannic, and creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is an excellent fruited Berliner weisse! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, berries, and pale malt flavors; very smooth, refreshing, and easy to drink with the balanced acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3920,"2016-10-10",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2016 Draft at Bru Craft. Very real raspberry/cranberry flavors but still mostly on the more modest end of sharp sours. Full but missing the stems and seeds. Still thick, huge extraordinary stuff. Liking quite a bit but lacking the proper depth that could make this a true favorate.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"

3920,"2016-06-10",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed at a little get together at Dougs house on June 08 with Travis and Chris also in attendance. Doug opened this 500 mL bottle after we thought she was too frozen to be able to get to it tonight. Glad its here. The pour is a foggy brighter pink color with a thick collar of purple-tinted foam that doesnt leave any lacing behind ad is thins out a bit. The aroma is excellent. The fruits are just out in force. Cranberry and raspberries are definitely detectable, and its nice that they both remain nicely crisp and tart. There is a certain dryness to them that I like. Its not wine-like, but the fruits are tart and dry. The flavors are incredible as well. Its just so crisp and light with big, booming flavors from the fruits. There is an excellent sourness that carries the fruits through, and I love it. The cranberry stands out as little more than the raspberry in this one. The mouth feel is light and crisp with an excellent bright carbonation and a quick-lived aftertaste of sour and dry fruits. This beer is killer. Thanks Doug!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
