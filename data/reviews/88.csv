88,"2016-08-20",3.7,"Pours opaque sable with a thin tan head. Aroma features roasted malt, bourbon and molasses tones. Flavor delivers bourbon, woody, mocha and roasted malt notes, tres tasty! Firm mouthfeel offers good fizz. Party on, Bishop!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
88,"2015-08-30",4.1,"Bottle. Pours black, small tan head, decent lacing. What an aroma, pumpkin spices and rum, nutmeg and cinnamon, allspice, rum balls. Flavor is really about the same. Quite spiced, but it kind of works out. Rummy. I am transported to my parents house on Thanksgiving, bloated from turkey, watching the Packers, but still finding a way to shove more pie in my head and wash it down with a Tom & Jerry. Medium sweet, light bitter, hella spiced. Not really a stout, in my opinion. This should be straight spice/herb/vegetable, but what the hell do I know. Medium body. This is out there in left field, but it is a damn interesting beer.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
88,"2015-04-20",4.5,"Draft at whole foods in Addison. What a find. Poured a deep brown with a sustained head. Nice rum on the nose follows in the mouth. Delicious.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
88,"2015-02-01",3.4,"Almost a jet black pour but had maple syrup colored head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is fig, plum, sugar, and licorice. First taste makes me think I?ll never drink an aged pumpkin beer again. The flavors not hold well. Although its sweet with carmel, malt, and sugar, the pumpkin flavor is dampened. I?m sure it was stronger when it was younger. Nutmeg, pinenuts, vanilla. Medium body and smooth. Wish it was a fresher beer.","Florida, USA","beastmaster"
88,"2015-01-29",3.8,"Pours pitch black with a mocha head. Head retention is average and lacing is above average. 

First smell is of pumpkin pie and baking spices, cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Booze is next, kinda like pyrat rum. Ends with sweet cocoa and some smoked malt.

Taste is definitely of a pumpkin beer. Sweet molasses, cinnamon, chocolate malt and booze are the dominate flavors. Rum is somewhat apparent, at 13% abv, it definitely warms the throat coming down. Finishes with some smoke and spicy ginger. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the lighter side for a high gravity imperial stout. Head faded prematurely unfortunately leaving body a bit thin. Carbonation levels are good.

Overall this beer was just overwhelmed by spices. Thought the addition of barrel aging and rum would mellow out and blend the flavors but I think I prefer the flavors in the base beer, Pumpkinator. Would be a good dessert beer but dont think I could handle the sweetness on a regular basis.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"
88,"2015-01-03",4.3,"Bottle courtesy of and shared with Omgrich. 
De couleur brune foncée, au col crémeux moka perdurant et laissant un filament doré au verre.
Arôme au profil profond de malts alternant un agréable biscuité, caramel, torréfié avec un bouquet surprenant de citrouille et all-spices; cannelle et girofle. Le tout allié avec talent la barrique de rhum.Lavantage étant que rien nest surfait et tout se complète à merveille.
Palais est malté avec de belles notes de rhum, rétro épicé de saison plus cette impression de purée de citrouille. Mélasse est moyenne ajoutant ce fini caramélisé en fin de bouche. Petite pointe surette de boisé sur la fin pour une bière qui reste facile à boire, complexe et souvrant au fil et à mesure de la dégustation.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

88,"2014-07-11",2.8,"In BB vertical 7/10/14. Least liked of the bunch by a lot. Appearance is best thing about this...the thickest of the three stouts in the line up. Nose is massive pumpkin spice, mostly nutmeg and clove. Taste follows, almost drying. Sweet, boozy. May like this even less than the regular. Some folks will love this...but not my kind of pumpkin beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

Not bad, but considering the work a bit of a miss.  Drank alongside the non barrel version.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"

88,"2014-03-13",4.8,"Saint Arnolds Bishops Barrel No. 6 has a thin, beige head, a black, oil-like appearance, with visible bubble streams, under direct sunlight, and essentially no lacing left behind. The aroma is of spices (think of cinnamon and nutmeg), vegetable, rum, vanilla, whipped cream, sweet barley malt, pie crust, molasses cookies, and wood. Taste is of all of those elements, with additional flavors of flaked coconut and white pepper, with some bitterness detected. Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy, and Saint Arnolds Bishops Barrel No. 6 finishes semi-dry, heavy, rich, and sip-able. Alcohol is most certainly detected. Profoundly good!

88,"2014-03-03",4.0,"I do loves me some Pumpkinator. This concoction mutes the pumpkin and spices somewhat and makes it quite a bit sweeter. Tasty but I much prefer the original.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
88,"2014-02-27",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2014 12 Oz bottle at home -- The aroma is amazing, strong sweet rum with spices, dark sugar scent, dark sugars, all very nice;honestly if possible this aroma is a 20/20. The flavor is incredibly complex lots of sweetness from the rum, mild pumpkin pie flavor and spices, with a little hotness. After 6 months of aging the flavor has improved, due to mellow of phenols.","North Dakota, USA","GreatDane1632"
88,"2014-02-25",1.8,"Bottle > Common Table. No head and zero reminance of Pumpkinator flavor. Just a hot boozy mess.

88,"2014-02-18",3.5,"On tap at the Holy Grail. Dark brown to black pour with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the chocolate with some cinnamon, clove and roasted malt thrown in. The flavor is a mix of chocolate and roasted malt with some cinnamon, clove, pumpkin, lactose, rum and oak notes. I also get a hint of metallic character. The beer is also very sweet and that turns me off a bit. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A bit let down on this one but it is hard to put my finger on exactly why.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
88,"2014-02-18",3.7,"deep black .. . light foam, almost no lacing .. . some rum in the nose, doesn;t really follow into the mouth- tar, burnt wood, and quite a bit of spice .. . mild mouth feel, ..  too easy to drink, lacks the heft of a barrel aged special release. enjoyable but lackluster in the important fields, this should have been mindblowing considering the base beer, i feel saint arnolds was trying to hard to be safe. oh well.. . .  So a blind man walks into a bar, a bus stop and a fence.",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
88,"2014-02-18",3.9,"The aroma is pumpkin pie and raisin or mince pie. A little bit of spiced rum comes out when it warms. The color is dark brown and opaque. The slight head is also dark brown with no lacing and disappears in no time. This has a full bodied flavor of pumpkin pie with hints of chocolate, dried fruit, baked goods and coffee. The alcohol is substantial and warming. The finish is warm and sweet balanced with a slight bitterness. The palate is full bodied and creamy with low carbonation. Overall, this is a good sipping beer that will warm your belly, fill you up and remind you of traditional holiday meals with friends and family.
