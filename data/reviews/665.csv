Ce nez memmène à rêver à un feu de foyer dans une cabane où lon sert une traditionnelle tarte au pacanes. Sublime nez! Lalcool est également présente mais cest bon: tout est parfaitement cohérent et harmonieux. Avec un tel nez, on ne peut que machinalement conduire le verre au bord des lèvres et attaquer dune lampée enthousiaste! En bouche, le liquide est dune rondeur parfaite; cest soyeux, liquoreux, généreux, chaud... quel mouthfeel divin! Les saveurs sont celles anticipées, auxquelles sajoutent avec force les flaveurs du fût de bourbon qui ajoutent, il faut le mentionner, une légère acidité au centre de la langue contrôlant ainsi le sucre avant que celui-ci ne semballe complètement .

Big fizz up and an instant death and Im left with this murky thing in my glass - bit of sediment snuck in my glass like a hook worm does in your foot. cool aroma - marzipan, some maple coating the barrel stuff and the oak, mocha minus most of the coffee character, some generic Speyside scotch, marshmallows, roasted malts, some sweetness, almonds, creamy butter, alcohol. Yea, that pretty much is all one needs in a glass. Time for a power drinkin as the popcorn oil is a blazin yo. Smooth and almost waxy on the lips and mouth parts that are within my mouth part. Not as complex - and some tongue numbing. Alcohol sweetness and zip on the finish - its actually pretty easy to simply concentrate on that alone if you have trained your mind for such a thing. Vanilla, extra sweetness, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, etc. Some scotchiness, maple.... not quite a sipper but my tastebuds are having a pretty easy time not really paying attention. I like it for sure and the maple is a good touch but this smells alot better than it tastes - not that it tastes bad what so ever. Maybe this just wasnt my night for this. Still tasty though. In fact, I just came back after 10 minutes away and its better than I recall. I think I ended up power drinking most of it and didnt give it the fair shake it needed.

665,"2013-01-08",3.9,"In short: A rich malty brown beer with well integrated maple and bourbon barrels.  Very good dessert beer.
How: Tap at brewpub.
The look: Cloudy brown body topped by a persistent small beige head.
In long: Nose has a medium bourbon presence that is pretty harmonious with the pleasant pure maple syrup aroma.  Taste starts with an attack of toffee and maple syrup and then a moderate bourbon barrel flavor joins in and then ends with a woody finish that partially washes some of the sweetness away.  Really full body with plenty of big soft bubbles, very nice mouthfeel.  No alcohol presence whatsoever.  This was radically different from the first batch that was released two years ago and that was very hot boozy and brutally boubonny.  Either this was a new batch or aging did wonders on this one.

App.:  Deep hazy mahogany with a frail light tan head.
  
Aroma:  Lots of smoky Bourbon-Scotch notes, gobs of dark dried fruit behind that, some esters, brown sugar and caramel, sweet, more Bourbon, maybe a little too much for my nose, a touch of alcohol, some brighter fruit notes, a hint of yeast.
  
Palate:  Medium body, fairly lively, prickly effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Lots of dark dried fruits, brighter fruits, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, plenty of wood...again mainly Bourbon and whiskey with some smoke, some alcohol, esters; sweet with restrained bitterness and a long, fruity and very alcoholic finish.

665,"2010-09-12",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This bourbon-laced Scotch Ale is able to accentuate the maple flavors with its vanilla-like spicy sweetness, leading to an alcohol splash, wooden dryness and candied berries.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the dark brown with coppery highlights.
-The flavor profile is a marvel of ingredient harmony.
-The light hop presence in the finish works perfectly with the wooden barrel and alcohol flames.
-The prickly but soft bubbling helps drinkability, but this remains a fiery sipper.
-This is an accomplished brew, but it may be too linear overall for me to call it ""excellent"" (when released). Age it a year and the barrel presence relaxes a bit and flavors become even more integrated.
