3830,"2016-06-28",3.8,"750mL bottle very generously given to me by Bobby and Nick. Drunk all to my greedy self on 6/12/16.Minimally to lightly hazy, soft lemon-golden body with a small, but fairly dense and well-retained white head atop.Soft wheat-like character and barrel tannin providing lots of cream-of-wheat, nuttiness and very light lactic character. Lemons, soft vanilla suggestions and light bubble gum.The texture is nicely carbonated, very tight and engaging with a very soft texture. Lots of lemon character and light honey-vanilla that balances well. Light tannin on the end fighting against the citrusy and lightly lactic tartness. An obvious similar comparison to Side Projects grisette and while I found both delicious and drinkable, this one had some bubble gum and spice notes at times that gave me slight allusions to a witbier. Mostly passing and minor, though. Lots of mineral character, light dough and lingering floral notes. Carbonation may be a bit too expansive at times, really accentuating the tannin and grain and interfering a bit with the overall softness of texture.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma: At the first draft you already know this will be super refreshing! Floral / tea notes at first along a soft grainy presence, light tartness, lemony notes and mild brettanomyces. 

Taste: In line with the aroma. Soft grainy presence that is just enough to carry the refreshing tea and lemon flavors. The moderate tartness and the lemon notes also add to the freshness impression. 

Palate: Light body. Medium carbonation. Dry. Mild oak spiciness. Lemony finish.

3830,"2015-04-27",4.1,"Pours a hazy yellow with a small white rim that leaves good lacing. There was some kind of surface tension thing going on that was funny to look at but not really great looking. Nose is of lemons and summer-ish. Light but refreshing. Taste is of lemon again, wheat, juice and lightly bitter (from the tea?). Body is light, carbonation moderate and I can picture myself drinking that all the time. Overall a really nice light saison from SARA!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3830,"2014-11-10",4.3,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is slightly grainy with a nice, light white wine note and some light oak and tannins. Medium light red apple notes with some peach and pear. Light citrus notes with e medium light phenolic character. 
Pours a slightly cloudy, pale yellow gold with a medium sized, fairly thick head with decent retention as it recedes to a thin film and lingers. Medium light lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is slightly sweet with some grain notes and bread character. Medium light tartness with some light oak and white wine tannins. Light white wine character as well. Low bitterness and a slight mineral quality. Hints of stone fruit and red apple as well as a light phenolic character. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a delicious beer and super enjoyable but the aroma is a bit more complex than the flavor. The beer is a bit delicate to support all the wine character in the flavor.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3830,"2014-11-10",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2014 Draft and bottle  reviewed from notes (8/2014 and 9/2014). Aroma is delicate, with subtle lemon, grainy must, light white wine and light brett. The beer pours slightly hazy golden color with small bubbly head that fades quickly. Flavor follows aroma pretty closely with a blend of lemon tartness, light lactic presence, light funk and oak. The body is light, with medium-light carbonation and a dry finish. The after taste is pretty clean, with more of a bready finish. Overall Lady in Grey is an incredible easy drinking, slightly tart and refreshing beer. The barrel influence seems a bit too subtle for my tastes, but perhaps the light funk blends some of that oak in. Great stuff.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"

Awesome brett aroma, leather, hay bales, saltwater, lemonheads, cantaloupe rind, chardonnay grapes. Flavor has a tart lacto lemon yogurt flourish up front that quickly melts away to a wheat-forward doughy finish. Sorta like saison meets Berliner weisse.
