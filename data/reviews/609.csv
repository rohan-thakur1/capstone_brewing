Márpedig lenniük kell, hiszen ilyen illatot úgy hihetnénk, egy sör nem képes produkálni. Bár már éreztem hasonlót, azok általában imperial stoutok voltak, s még azt is megkockáztatnám, hogy a""Beer Geek Brunch Weasel"" szavak szerepeltek a nevükben. Ez esetben azonban egy sweet stout-ról van szó, amelynek karaktere dúskál a jelzőkben, hiszen mind illata, mind íze eleven csokoládé-, és kávébomba, brownie, vanília, kis rum és konyak az aromái között, súlyos jegyek a forró csokoládés, kakaós, kávélikőrös ízfolyamban.

609,"2015-07-26",4.2,"5 oz draft pour at Angry Chair. Pours nearly pitch black in color and topped by a small layer of khaki colored foam that settles quickly to a thin film leaving streaks of lace behind. The aroma is crazy showing both sweet milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate, fudge, along with vanilla beans, and a hint of coconut from the base beer. Then a wave of roasted coffee and espresso hits you as well. The flavor follows with the dark chocolate and fudge followed by the vanilla and espresso. Toasted coconut adds even more depth and smoothness to the beer. There is just the right amount of bitterness to balance out all the sweetness. Nearly full bodied and creamy in the mouthfeel with subtle carbonation leading to a chocolate and mocha finish. Very rich and decadent beer that is basically dessert in a glass. The coffee just adds another layer to the awesome base beer. The 5 oz was all I needed, but its amazing stuff in small quantities. These guys know how to make dark beers.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
