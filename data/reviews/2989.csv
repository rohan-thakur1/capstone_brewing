2989,"2009-05-19",1.7,"Can. Pours a viscous blonde, head gone in an instant. Sweet aroma, I swear I got some champagne in the nose.. Taste has detracting metallic twang, not so bad as expected though. Quite bitter. Alcohol definetely present. Didnt drainpour.. actually finished the whole damn thing... But the slightly weaker version at 8 or so % is a whole lot better.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","lgklotet"
2989,"2009-02-25",2.2,"Rich and full bodied. Complex character and decent scents. Very hard on the palate though. Despite its potential and promise, I do not find it an easy beer to handle, much less appreciate. Its very hard to reconcile all the palate reactions. This brew taxes the tongue and throat, not to mention the brain too. Unrefreshing. A bit like knocking your head on the wall.",", SINGAPORE","TerenceHua"
