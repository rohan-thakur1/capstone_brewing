2802,"2016-11-09",3.4,"Clear pale golden color, and off course no head. Ok intensity in the aroma. Medium + body and an oily texture. Nice round and mellow sweetness. Rice, mild basement, apple and some spices. A bit refreshing actually. Complex and tasty. Well masked alcohol.[Bottle at yngwie plaza]","Halden, NORWAY","Cunningham"
2802,"2016-10-14",3.9,"Bottle. More or less clear in the glass, lightly oily. The aroma is very fruity, complex, with a nice alcohol burn, some cellar and a leathery, oxidized touch. Ripe peaches, notes of orange zest and mango. Some rice in the far back. Its full bodied, oily and warming on the palate. Some rice and meaty umami in the back of the flavor, its fruity as hell, in a ripe and canned way, with a very matured, aged, almost oxidized way, all lasting for a good while. Sure a delicious one. And complex indeed. 161014","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

2802,"2016-08-13",3.9,"350 ml bottle. Clear yellow golden body without any head. Quite strong in aroma, ripe apple and pear with sake yeast, rise and a hint of plum in the background. The flavor is definitively sake but at the same time totally different to any other sake I have tasted. Quite sweet, apple, pear and rise like expected from aroma, umami and something toffee or caramel like in the background. Tried to pare this with different kind of food, but thats difficult. My experience was definitively not fish, nor anything salt, difficult to find the right cheese as well, something sweet and fat seems to be the best but did not have any chocolate in the house. Totally unique experience for me and highly enjoyable.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
