2121,"2017-06-13",3.9,"Draft at the Engine Room. Pours golden with a white head that disappears quickly. Leaves no lacing in the glass. Huge, huge oak on the nose which gives the effect of some rather stinky cheese but stinky in a good way. Nice grass and floral notes on the tongue along with the wood ones. The wood does linger a bit. Its different but in a good way.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"

2121,"2016-08-25",4.0,"Pours a hazy yellow golden color with a trace of bubbles rising to the top. Nose is oak forward with soft vanilla, wet old barrel, lemon peel and basement funk. Palate follows with a focused acid profile, heightened by lemon notes and subtle stonefruit. Lingering funk and an old austere barrel profile make this one a winner in my book !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

Light bodied with light carbonation.

Good grief. I go to the bathroom and the other stuff I posted disappears.

In a nutshell, looks average, has a fruity vinegar tartness smell with a hint of Brett.

Tastes of green apples , vinegar, mild funk, bit of hop bitterness, overall very dry.

Dorée, col fin blanc.
Arôme offre un excellent bouquet de oût de vin blanc avec un bouquet subtil et herbacé de thym. Le tout faisant pener à un léger houblonnage à cru.
Palais est léger, pointe surette avec un petit rappel vin blanc et ici aussi, ce côté moût. Pointe herbacée rappelant la bergamote - thym. Citronné avec une pointe thé vert et citronnelle + raisin blanc léger. Léger et surprenant. Une belle remontée que les déceptions que furent les deux Kolsch.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
