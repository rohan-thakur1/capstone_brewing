4259,"2017-02-08",3.8,"Aroma: Medium-high, rich raspberry with light molasses and tobacco. Soft alcohol notes. 
Appearance: Very dark, red body. Hazy. Light-brown head with fine bubbles. Low retention.
Flavour: Medium-high sourness (from the fruit I assume) on first sip. The sourness returns after every sip, but it makes the way for other flavours initially. Medium-light molasses and tobacco flavours make a appearance, more so as the beer warms up. Medium bitterness. Very dry finish with lingering sourness, raspberry and very light molasses.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, Full bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Medium warming.
Overall: The raspberry is front and center and it it both the first aroma and the last flavour. However, it nearly completely masks the base beer. The beer is a great experience regarding the sourness and the stronger/fuller beer.

4259,"2015-04-29",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2017 Butelka, warka do 20/01/20. Ciemny, brazowy, wyglada na klarowny, choc to przy tak ciemnym piwie trudno ocenic... bardzo ladna, wysoka piana, lekko brazowawa, opadajaca srednio szybko, pozostajaca w postaci korzuszka i nieco rowniez brudzaca szklo. Aromaty quadruplowe, bardzo intensywne, slodowe, rodzynkowe, sliwkowe, karmelowe, lekko kawowe, zbozowe. Tytulowych malin prawie nie czuc w aromacie. Za to smak jest zdominowany (no, prawie zdominowany) przez bardzo kwaskowaty malinowy sok - ta dominanta zupelnie nie pasuje do aromatu. W tle jednak sa rowniez wyraznie wyczuwalne - choc przytlumione - nuty z aromatu, nuty faktycznie dobrego quadrupla. Sa tez jakies slodkie posmaki w tle - zapewne laktoza - niemniej fakt, ze Mikkeller to piwo ma w grupie ""Sweet"" to nieporozumienie. Zaskakujaca kombinacja. brak goryczki. Alkohol super dobrze ukryty (a wszak bardzo mocne piwo), srednie wysycenie. Bardzo ciekawa. w posmakach pozostaje wiecej quadrupla czy BDSA niz w samym smaku. Calosciowo: bardzo fajne.
