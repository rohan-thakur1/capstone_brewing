153,"2017-03-16",4.4,"Grifo en 99Cervezas. 
Vierte marrón oscuro completamente opaco, con espuma de café muy cremosa y adherente, compuesta de burbuja pequeña bastante persistente. Buena carbonatación con algunos hilos de burbujas subiendo a la superficie (sólo visibles en la parte exterior de la copa ya que es imposible ver nada más adentro). 
Intensa en nariz con notas predominantes de café y quizá aun más de regaliz. Notas secas leñosas y un punto herbal muy al fondo. También ciruela pasa bastante seca y melaza, como base de todo lo anterior. Gran complejidad en nariz en un conjunto extraordinariamente expresivo para ser una ""simple"" Porter. Casi hemos de comprobar su graduación (6,5% ABV) para asegurarnos de que no se trata en realidad de una Imperial Porter. 
De entre los sabores básicos destaca el amargo, con una buena base de dulce y un punto ácido. En el post-gusto el café y la regaliz compiten por reinar, aunque la evolución en boca acaba dando el mando al café, con un sabroso equilibrio final amargo-dulce-ácido. 
Es de cuerpo medio-alto, más bien sedosa, casi carnosa y ligeramente picante. Resulta sorprendentemente refrescante, sobre todo a partir del tercer trago, cuando nuestra lengua se ha acostumbrado a esta expresividad. 
Esta cerveza tiene la intensidad y el peso en boca de una Imperial Porter (o casi) con la bebestibilidad de una Porter normal más ligera. Todo un logro! Una bebida de trago medio que maridará muy bien con cerdo, ternera y sobre todo cordero, así como con quesos fuertes. Total y completamente recomendable.

I had such an awful bottle of this years ago that I never rated it, now that it is available locally I have been meaning to try it for quite some time. A steady pour produces a three-finger thick, fairly dense consistency, deep brown stained, dark tan colored head. The beer is almost perfectly black, and is quite opaque when held up to the light. Visually this looks nothing like a modern Porter, much more like a rich dark stout. I wonder how the aroma and flavor will go?
The aroma smells of deeply charred grain, dark chocolate, smooth roasted coffee, deeply toasted whole grain brown bread, deeply caramelized malt aromatics, really just lots of brown, whole grain, and toasted malt notes play a huge role here.
The body is light and quite quaffable, given the visual, and the aromas, I was expecting this beer to be quite a bit more hefty; I am glad to be wrong, as I still was hoping for a Porter here. The flavor is deeply charred, but is balanced by a bright, caramelized sweetness. Lingering, bitingly bitter, burnt grain notes substantially dry out the finish; there is also a hop bitterness that supports the charred bitter notes. After a couple of sips, I notice that the body is on the rich side, with a certain viscosity that clings to the palate, but this is washed away by the lingering burnt bitter flavors in the finish. Burnt whole grain brown-bread toast, lots of caramelized maltiness, bitter, though rich, cold coffee, and ample dark chocolate flavors all play a prominent role as well.
This is the most stout like porter that I have had in a while; given the nebulous definition between the two, I can overlook that, but really since this is so tasty. I really dont care in the end, but I would be hard pressed to not say that this was a Stout in a blind tasting. I am so glad to be able to have a non-infected sample of this finally. In fact I may even have to buy this regularly; it can be hard to find really good, reasonably fresh, Stouts, err, I mean Porters, locally sometimes. Definitely an incredible beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

153,"2016-09-26",4.4,"Pours as black as the night with a dark brown, medium sized, bubbly head.

Smells of sweet milk chocolate, toffee and leafy hops. Bakers chocolate and earthy cocoa nibs add to the well pronounced milk chocolate quality, with a flowery hint being able to cut through.

Has a lower carbonation and a pleasantly creamy, medium body, which screams chocolate all the way. Its finish though reveals a pungent dry and earthy crushed coffee bean appearance, which works incredibly well as an antagonist to the the initial chocolate sweetness.

Tastes of creamy milk chocolate from the get go, together with some dusty earth and a metallic hint, resulting from the initially noteable carbonation. Adds a toffee hint, as well as powdery bakers chocolate, remaining pleasantly balanced on the tongue, due to its gentle creaminess. Then there is suddenly absolutely nothing going on, but a totally calm ending which does not even turn watery, just producing a subtle dry hint. This is the part I love most about this beer. Its coffee finish, which picks up on all the prominent chocolate flavors, while adding the most creamy and dry long lasting aftertaste you can imagine. It truly takes it time to become recognizable, but once its there, it completely redefines the beer. In a good way.

Man this is lovely, what an overlooked gem on my end with so many hyped beers getting released on a daily basis nowadays. This features actually everything which made me interested in craft beer years ago. It is way different than your industrial brewed Lager, well balanced and features an enigmatic thumbprint. It remains easy drinkable throughout, while providing such a satisfying depth, with a world class twist between chocolate and coffee.","GERMANY","aleigator"

153,"2016-04-23",4.2,"Pours head-high with minimal lacing after; appears rich and shutter-dark, with plum highlights when held against the sunlight. Smells like alcohol-infused pumpernickel bread with a tinge of citrus. The taste is sweeter than it is bitter due to the preponderance of roasted malt, but the hop presence here is a little stronger than a traditional porters. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick, and the aftertaste of black coffee (or 80% dark chocolate, if you prefer) lingers. Very drinkable even for people who dont like bitterness because the malt defines the direction and the result is more like a chunk of slightly sweetened dark chocolate than a handful of mountain ash berries or a stringent aperitif.","White Plains, USA","Purthegorpthy"
153,"2016-04-21",4.2,"To jest to co Tygryski lubią najbardziej. Pachnie niesamowicie.
W nos uderzają nuty czekolady, kawy z mlekiem, ciesteczek ala Pieguski, kakao.
Okraszone jest to umiarkowaną, nienachalną palonością. Aromat jest głęboki i cholernie przyjemny.
Piwo nalewa się z ogromną, kremową, puszystą pianą. Otacza ona bardzo szeroko ścianki szkła pozostawiając na nich masę pajęczynek. Bardzo długo utrzymuje się na powierzchni.
Kolor nieprzejrzyście czarny.
Na podniebieniu wyczuwalne nuty gorzkiej czekolady, kakao i kawy. Akcenty palone zaczynają wydobywac się z oddal i coraz mocniej zaznaczać swoją obecność.
Piwo początkowo wydaje się dość wytrawne. Po kilku łykach można się przyzwyczaić do tego smaku i wyłapać trochę słodyczy.

Piwo nie jest aż tak gęste jak bym tego oczekiwał, aczkolwiek wodnistym też bym go nie nazwał.

153,"2016-01-01",4.0,"A complex brew, served too cold, is not served well. American refrigerators, and the individuals and bars that employ these devices, have a lesson to be learned at their peril. Certainly, the exquisite Trappistes, the quads, tripels, dubbels, lose quite a bit of their charm with increasing frostiness. So too those robust and flavorful darker brews like this fine porter. Complexity is decreased by coolness, appreciation as well. Regardless, the fine Founders Porter is a dish best served... warmer, perhaps at 50F. So much for that. Wanting to know how good this is?

The open mouth of the bottle releases a sweet, milk chocolate aroma, and Im brought back in time to the dipping of sugared toast into hot chocolate; a favorite treat when my brother and I would discover that school was closed for a SNOWDAY!
The brew is cocoa with a soft, cappuccino head, wet and heavy on the sides of the glass. Toast, chocolate and dark, rich, almost burnt caramel waft through the air as I bring the glass to my lips for a long draw. The huge, full body is rich and full of flavor, the texture chewy; I suddenly feel an almost desperate longing for a thick, sexy cigar, and to be enveloped in tight black leather. So contrary to the figure on the bottle. So like me to be contrary.
The finish is short, dry and ashy, and the experience is going to be a favorite for me. The aftertaste is fantastic; dark, roasty and tasting of deep chocolate. There is nothing I could find wrong with an experience like that.
I hate to give any of this up to do a mix with the Rubaeus, but indeed I will.","USA","lightbias"

Pretty much perfect, really. Not only for the intensity but also because of the quality. Quite a different story in the mouth. Initially an earthy, peppery and slightly herbal hoppy punch togheter with a solid, bitter and roasted presence. Much more coffee than chocolate compared to the aroma, even though reminds me more of a watered down version instead of a proper espresso.

153,"2014-11-25",1.8,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.

A: Pours out of the bottle an inky brown, that becomes black in the glass - so much so that it absorbs all nearby light. Forms a thin brown head, which quickly fades to a ring. No lacing to speak of.

S: Roasted malt meets light coffee and semi-sweet chocolate, all wreathed together in a nice balance.

T: And it all falls apart. I did not expect to get such a piney hop bite from the nose, yet that is virtually all I can taste in this beer. Its difficult to notice any other aspect of the flavor profile - so much so that I cannot. This is effectively a black IPA for those who enjoy pine.

153,"2014-11-24",4.1,"April 20th, 2013 - This is a momentous occasion. It marks the first Founders beer Ive ever tasted, after a long wait and enduring lots of talk about its extraordinary chemistry. And its the porter, no less. Ive been introduced to breweries with their IPA line extended out forward, and while it tells me that theyre excellent pale ale brewers, its not the style or the shade of beer that I hope to see at the vanguard of a brewerys offerings. So, here I meet Founders at the right level, with a darker, moodier beer in hand. The pour, gently executed, kicks up a heavy lumber colored foam, which neatly splits the glass into the heady top and an inky black bottom. From the smell I detect deep chocolate and dark roasted coffee, spiced with soy sauce and heavy, heavy cream, giving it a high-end richness and luxurious edge. The carbonation is nice, introducing beer to tongue with a smooth transition from bubbly to oily, and delivering a charcoal and hickory smokiness, and ending with a clear roasted malt note that rings deep and true. The alcohol is perfectly measured to match, leaving a subtle charred barrel aftertaste alongside the malt roast. The balance here is impeccable, and while its not one of the ""bucking broncos"" of the style - violent, kicking, frenzied and fried - its quiet subtlety demands my respect.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Despite the full body the beer manages to have a balanced, almost semi-dry finish, so thats good, not overly sweet. There is a remarkable amount of body and flavor crammed into this moderate strength beer, which is a feat unto itself - and its not cloying.

Poured an almost pitch black color with 1-to-2 fingers of bubbly, tan head. Good layered, foamy, spiderweb lacing along the sides of the glass. Average retention.

Smelled dark chocolate fudge, smoky woodfire, dark roasted nuts, crayon, caramel, toffee, chocolate and some dark bitter coffee malts.

Tasted better than the smell, but still pretty similar. Got dark chocolate, fudge, smoky fire, crayon, toffee, rich, smoky roasted nuts, caramel and smooth coffee notes.

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. Was great all the way down.

A very good porter. This one grew on me as it went down. I might of underrated this a bit.","","User134089"

Poured into pint glass

Appearance  Pours a dark brown almost black color with a billowy dark tan head. The head is rather persistent and lasts quite awhile. Eventually when it fades, and when the glass is swirled, it leaves some nice lacing.

Smell  The nose is relatively mild, but contains some notes of chocolate and a bit of caramel and vanilla sweetness.

Taste  A nice sweet bready maltiness is the first to be tasted. Roasted barley and some chocolate work their way into the flavor toward the middle of the taste. At the very end ,it sweetens again this time with some chocolate and vanilla which round out the taste profile quite nicely.

Mouthfeel  A nice smooth yet relatively thick body. It coats the tongue but yet is still very east to drink. The carbonation is spot on enhancing the drinkability of the brew.

Overall  A nice porter with lots of deep roasty and chocolate flavors. One of the better and more affordable porters.","","Darkmagus82"

153,"2014-02-26",4.1,"Look: Pours with large, mocha head, fine small bubbles with some bigger ones in the middle. Good, steady, slow, creamy retention with sticky lacing. Nice, fat layer stays on top. Surprisingly some carbonation visible. Dark, dark with brown hue. Very nice, especially the retention. 


Smell: Dark, milk chocolate mix, roast and light coffee. Hint of caramel and some noble freshness. Fat, rich on the nose receptors. There is one note i cant really put my finger on, like a bit too oily (olive) burned bread crust you put on salad, in soups and shit like that. 


Taste: Smell roughly translates. Roasted, very solid middle malt medium sweetness. Dark and milk chocolate and very light caramel. Good roast bitterness goes into coffee with a hint of hops and sweetness - a nice touch at the end. 


Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, full body. Very nice. Carbonation noticeable but just the right amount. One of the biggest traits of this beer.


Overall: Sexy. Yea, why not. Mouthfeel is exceptional, the dark malt character is well developed and rich enough and that hint of fresh sweetness makes it a superb brew.","SLOVENIA","tmzl"

Clear, deep Cola blackish brown colour with traces of yeast sediments; One quarter finger head and dark beige foam which fades in 30 seconds; Small sticky lacing and zero carbonation; Fragrant sweet aroma of roasted dark malt, with vanilla, milk chocolate, coffee, caramel, waffles, sugar and faint grass; Nice, light sweet taste of roast malt, with strong nuts, initial smoked salmon, black coffee, burnt toast, burnt toffee, dark chocolate, liquorices, light dry biscuits, lime and bitter hops; Mid to light body, slightly thick palate; Mouth feel is nutty and initially smoky, with unexpected but pretty nice smoked salmon which only lasts for a couple sips. Light sweetness is fully controlled by decent and limey bitter hops. Body is close to watery despite thickish tongue. Strong but subdued black coffee, expressive burnt toast, very well hidden booze. This is nice Hoppiness is faint grassy nose, strong lime and sharp grassy taste. Bitterness is authoritative and tasty for a lasting strong bitter sweet finish; Quite dry after taste, bitter and quite savoury to mouth.

Comments: This is a nice Porter no doubt. I prefer Porter and Stout to be a bit more creamy and have strong body, which this one kinda fell short in both areas, plus its head is unimpressive, and lesser variety in aroma and taste. However, it has some nice fleshes of smoke and nuts, firmly toasty and hoppy. Stubborn and nice in its own way, glad Ive tried it but its overhyped.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
153,"2014-02-14",4.1,"Bottle: Deep, dark brown color that appears pitch black in dimly lit rooms; topped with a nice, tan-ish colored head made of fine bubbles with very nice staying power.

Flavor is super nutty & very toasty up front with a hint of oily coffee bean, creamy chocolate, cocoa powder, & a small, leafy hop presence. It finishes with a boderline charred woody note, more nuts, & a bittersweet cocoa mouth coating. Great body on this - silky smooth & appearing much larger than the ABV would suggest.

153,"2014-02-13",4.1,"Starts off with smokey burnt malt, that fades into some dark caramel with chocolate on the nose. No detectable hops in the aroma.

Appearance is jet black with some light ruby highlights around the edges, the beer is almost opaque.

Full bodied chewy mouthfeel, low to moderate carbonation, thin tan head.

Flavor starts off strong with roasted malt, almost a smokey flavor that gives way to dark caramel, liquorice,dates and some chocolate.

Overall very strong rich beer with a ton of complex malt flavor, maybe a touch heavy on the burnt notes for my taste but really great beer.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","codfishh"

Roasted and chocolate malts are quite prominent, nice dark chocolate flavour with toasty bitterness, a good helping of sweetened dark-roast coffee, slightly burnt flavour later on with quite a decent bite of bittering but not overly green hops. Dark chocolate and a slight nutty flavour linger long after swallowing along with a little roast. Mouthfeel is moderate but not watery like some porters, carb fairly soft, dry and powdery in the finish. I usually find myself wanting a bigger dark beer when drinking a standard porter.

153,"2013-03-20",4.0,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. 

Appearance: Black. Thats all there is. Mild carbonation, and no light gets through, theres no lacing, and theres also just a very small head that quickly dissipates. Of course, if you do an aggressive pour, youll get a really nice tan head. I recommend doing so.

Smell: Espresso. Roast. Maltiness. Mmm. Its rather light though.

Taste: It smells a bit better than it tastes... the initial taste is mostly just roastiness, but after it sits on your tongue for a bit, I get some dark coffee bitterness, with a hint of dark chocolate in there as well. Theres the warming of alcohol at the finish as well.

Mouthfeel: Its definitely rich, but not nearly as creamy as I was expecting it to be. Sort of surprising, but not a huge deal.

Overall, its an incredibly big, robust beer. The thing about it is, I feel sort of goofy drinking this in August. This to me screams winter, in front of a warm fire place, or maybe even as a substitute on a cool morning for warm coffee. This isnt my type of beer to casually drink -- I tend to prefer lighter beers for every day drinking -- but theres no denying its quality. It smells phenomenal, and its taste is one that I feel can surely grow on me as I get older. I dont feel its as fantastic as the rating suggests, but its undoubtedly a well made beer.

Its a very pleasant aroma that fades soon after the pour.  I taste roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and a little smoke.

153,"2013-02-04",2.9,"Too often in a fit of oh shit the babys going to wake up, poop everywhere and need to be changed, fed and played with I dont let the beer mellow, to come down a few degrees. I started this review in haste before deciding to take my own advice. Glad I did.

STYLE: American Porter

ABV: 6.5%

LOOK: Unremarkable, the midpoint between oily and soda. An appalling lack of lacing. What head?

NOSE: Were off to a rather good start. Over a foot away, I can smell the chocolate and red fruits as it pours. Better as it warms. Smoother too. Weve gone from metallic to mid-range coffee.

MOUTH: It settles into coffee and lightly burnt malts. Not the extraordinary failure I thought it was at first. Medium body, dirty, barn doors, green pear. It has to be sessionable, but not because the ABV is relatively low. It simply lacks something robust, be it flavor or texture.

Pours a dark brown almost black with brown highlights on the edges. The head is small and tan and recedes quickly to the edges where it persists. 
Flavor starts with some semisweet chocolate but this quickly fades to a nice mocha/coffee notes. Behind that comes a nice hop flavor. Some pine resin and just a hint of citrus. The fruit notes in the flavor are minimal. Bitterness is moderate and astringency is minimal. No alcohol flavor. Finishes with a touch of sweetness to balance a bitter chocolate and coffee note. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Astringency is low. Mouthfeel has a nice silkiness to it.

153,"2012-12-11",4.1,"12 oz bottle, Whole Foods Columbus.  Jet black; initially a big, brown, frothy and creamy head that becomes a thin covering yet a notable ring the whole way down the glass persist; huge lacing despite the head becoming thin; head can be revived by swirling for more than an hour.  Aroma is utterly and overly dominated by roast and coffee; this one-dimension-ality is not something that I am willing to praise.  Flavor is up front deep roast, coffee, and completely unsweetened chocolate as suggested by the aroma; this is followed by dark chocolate and vanilla, but, despite all this, there is not enough clarity in these flavors and so Im not floored by that aspect of the beer.  Mouthfeel is really great; silky, creamy, frothy, and maybe just the tiniest bit thin for a big beer, but Im not going to deduct points because it is what it should be for this beer.  This appearance and palate of this beer are world-class elements of this beer; but the aroma and flavor simply arent complex enough for the prestige that this brew carries.  Absolutely, this is a really solid porter, but its too basic to call this 100th percentile overall.  Well above your standard micro porter, though, and for a beer that doesnt bill itself as ""imperial,"" this is really very good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

Live tasting 12 oz. bottle into Duvel tulip...

Appearance; pours a deep dark brown out of the bottle, that becomes black in the glass with cola edges... Single finger head falls exceptionally quickly, leaving nothing but a very thin ring of bubbles around the edges..

Smell; lots of roasty malt, coffee, caramel and chocolate... 

Taste; quite similar to the smell, jumps right in with coffee and roasted malts, the caramel and chocolate are more subdued and quite nicely accent the roastiness... Medium finish with a nice lingering roasted malt/coffee flavor.

Mouthfeel; on the light side of full bodied, with a bit more carbonation than I would expect, but it definitely compliments the flavor and body of the beer... Slightly sticky, it hangs around a bit on the sides of the glass but nowhere near the extent of a beer like Ten Fidy...

The beer had a rich, thick black color with a dark brown hue and a good-sized creamy-foamy off-white head with good retention and lacing, and great cling.  Its aroma featured a blend of chocolate and caramel malt, with light touches of coffee, and some lighter earthy and floral hops.  The taste was sweet and malty with features of chocolate, a bit of caramel, and some mild grainy-earthy bitterness, which was well blended.  The body was slightly creamy and a touch on the wet side with average carbonation and fizz, and a good, filling and creamy mouthfeel.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

A wickedly chocolate malt flavour, complimented by a soft smoke. Probably like a victim of 94% burny area, for some reason got horny and there was a willing homosapian that wanted to choke on the happy fluids excreted by said burny victim. BUT, that burny victim wouldn't have much other than a pineapple diet. But more smoke than love-fluid.

153,"2012-08-24",3.7,"Poured from a 12 oz.. bottle into a tulip.

Coming out of the bottle, Founders Porter looks thick and viscous, with a nearly black color.  There is a small off-white head that manages to leave a bit of lace down the sides of the glass.

The aroma is full of unsweetened dark chocolate and roasted malt.  A bit of espresso and a generous hop bill adds a bitter aroma.

For a porter, this beer is definitely big on flavor.  The unsweetened dark chocolate and roasted malts dominate, but a general hoppiness works its way in toward the end.  Each sip also has a little bit of caramel sweetness, vanilla, and coffee.

Founders Porter is a little bit on the sticky side, despite not having a strong sweet character.  The carbonation is right in the middle between creamy and smooth, and the body is on the full side for the style, despite not having a huge ABV.

Edit:  2016 revision ... I first reviewed this four years ago.  I drink it all the time now.  This beer is one of the reasons that porter is my favorite beer style.  Every time I think I understand the style, I revisit some porter that I like and find that not only do I not understand the style, I dont even understand individual good porters.

S: This has a lot of chocolate on the nose. Theres some roasty coffee as well, but it almost smells like a melted chocolate bar to me.

T: Theres more coffee in the taste than there is on the nose; likewise, it isnt as chocolaty as the nose would suggest.

A - Pours dark brown, bordering on black, with a nice one and a half finger tall tan head leaving spotty patches of lace down most of the glass.

T - Starts off with plenty of dark roast - both from the malt and the coffee - slowly giving way to some sweetness from the chocolate and dark fruits.

	Im getting like a sort of nutty earth and rubbery cheap candybar in the taste, super thin in the mouth, little oily, sticks around too long with that peanut butter aftertaste thing going on.  And on third/fourth sip Im getting like a heavy sharp dose of medicinal alcohol and is that a dark fruit creeping in?  Not bad, not great, a porter, but not what Im looking for in a porter.

153,"2012-02-09",3.9,"Bottle. The pour was a pitch black with a slight ruby hue and an average sized (1-2 finger) medium brown creamy head that totally lasted throughout and produced excellent streaks of lacing.

The aroma was of a roasted chocolate malts and a mildly sweet leathery yeast with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, a bit of caramel and a touch of dark fruit.

The taste was lightly sweet with a hint of chocolate and some dark fruit in the beginning and finished a nice bitter sweet with a healthy dose of coffee and a mild caramel sweetness at the end. The flavor lasted an average amount of time proceeding the swallow, with a mild bitter sweet coffee taste that was left to linger.

153,"2011-12-07",3.9,"Det här är en god porter där smaken präglas främst av mörk choklad och lite kaffe. Jag tycker mig kunna känna lite humle i aromen vilket känns märkligt eftersom maltigheten tar över smaken på ölen och där kan jag inte känna någon som helst nyans av humle. Dessutom kan jag känna en liten nyans av syra, men det är chokladen som gör det största jobbet här.","SWEDEN","stefannilssons"

153,"2011-12-05",5.0,"Man, stingy bitch*s rating this beer.  It simply doesnt get any better than this.  One could mount a niggling criticism that it is mislabeled as a porter, as many have noted, and certainly there is truth in this charge.  However, once you get passed that, you can drink it for what it is:  the best porter in the world (and if you take it as a stout, among the best of that genre as well).  Contrary to the previous evaluator, I rate the carbonation as a major strength, but I personally dislike weak carbonation of stouts of the Guinness variety.

153,"2011-04-17",4.3,"Purchased at Archer Liquors in Chicago, IL; enjoyed on a cool spring Sunday after a 5K run while watching the White Sox.  Appearance is beautiful, very rich dark brown with a prominent tan head.  Aroma has a strong chocolate presence with hints of cocoa, roasted malts, pretty sweet in nose, and with all those notes I would expect some sort of creaminess/lactose in the nose but its not there, which to me is somewhat interesting as I was expecting it.  But then again, this is a porter and not a stout, and Im glad that the lactose isnt present.  Taste is extremely good, not too heavy and not really that thin, finds a nice balance with good carbonation.  Hints of obvious chocolate but not dominant, along with a bit of roasted malts and (to me) a small hint of coffee in the mix.  It rounds those things very well where each ingredient can be detected but not dominant.  Has an outstanding drink ability to it as well, I feel like I can easily drink multiple in a row, next time Ive got to get a 6 pack instead of a single bottle.  For a traditional true porter that isnt enhanced by additional ingredients (i.e. coconut, smoked malts, etc) I cant think of a better one.  Very very good stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

Overall, there are two porters that tie for my favorite and they are both from MI: this and Darkhorse Special Black Bier. They both kind of go beyond of what I usually get from this style.

153,"2011-04-12",4.0,"Appearance: Opaque black body with no red whatsoever. Forms a thick, brown, creamy/frothy head which retains very well and leaves pretty lacing on the glass throughout.Smell: Roasted barley, dairy, a hint of alcohol. Smell seems to indicate it will be a bitter, dry beer.Taste: I wish all porters were as flavorful as Founders! This is that rare beer that is hearty and robust and still manages to retain the qualities of a porter. The palate is, for lack of a better decription, ""typical"" porter with the toasted malt, a milky/dairy sweetness across the middle, and slight milk chocolate on the finish. Its not a particularly bitter or dry beer as is common with stouts, so there is next to no coffee flavor or bitterness here. The finish is surprisingly clean, with a hint of confectionary sweetness (frankly, I wouldnt have minded some aftertaste here).Mouthfeel: Silky smooth and soft. It doesnt coat the entire mouth the way an imperial stout would, but definitely covers the tongue from start to finish. Drinkability: While not the tastiest beer Ive ever had, Founders Porter is one of the most quaffable. Between the flavorful, but tame palate, gentle mouthfeel and smooth finish its difficult to not throw this beer down as if it were a shot. Its a fun beer to savor. The 6.5% ABV feels right, but might be a tad higher than would be preferred from a porter as I would love to session this but think Id get overwhelmed quickly.Overall, the best porter Ive ever had and an excellent beer in its own right.

Carbonation is nice but a bit much on the back of the mouth -- one of my few complaints. More complex than most porters Ive had -- develops a bitter dark chocolate/almond aftertaste due to the hops used.

153,"2010-05-26",4.4,"12 ounce bottle - $1.79 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Dispenses an onyx black body sporting a tall, proud-looking, dark tan head with plenty of staying power and substantial lacing.

Smell: Rich malty nose of bold, roasty coffee beans, melty bittersweet chocolate bars, licorice sticks, and moist dark fruits. A delightfully sultry scent, indeed.

Taste: The firm roastiness leads in the taste, with a flavor of strong coffee unabashedly laced with chocolate sauce, licorice, and a hint of real vanilla bean. Amply sweet throughout. Dark fruitiness buried within the heady maltiness. Roasty, earthy bitterness. Shot of cream. Long, leisurely, roasty finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth, succulent creaminess to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Its really pushing at the boundary line between porters and stouts. A sterling, tasty robust porter from ole Founders and one I freely, even cheerfully recommend to others.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

I found the aroma to be very smokey, with mesquite and tobacco, with a good amount of espresso roast, and some slight noble hops. The flavor is more roasty coffee, with a bit of tobacco, and a fair mix of coffee and hops. The mouthfeel is thick for a porter imo, but thats not really a bad thing.

Nice deep brown color with a tan head. Wonderful nose is thick and rich w/ coffee and chocolate--potent, smooth and inviting. Flavor is perhaps not quite at the same richness but is very much in the same territory. Medium bodied, slightly oily slick w/ perhaps a hair too much carbonation. But, so as not to end on a down note, I should mention this detracts very little from the overall presentation of this fine dark ale.

Clear roasted and chocolate malt in the nose, espresso and shoe polish. The body is full and rich, but there is a lightness that makes it slide right over the tongue. Flavors of chocolate and roasted malt (sweetness emerges at it warms); finishes with a lasting and puckering dry roasted bitterness.  The description on the bottle gets it just right: dark, rich and sexy. It would be easy to confuse it with an imperial stout in a blind taste test. Fantastic.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","pauls_parade"

The aroma is sweet chocolates, roasted malts, sweet coffee, earthy. The flavor is charred chocolates, roasted malts, sweet milky flavors, light metallic hops linger in the background.

153,"2010-04-05",4.0,"12oz bottle. Pours very dark brown - almost black - with a moderate but short-lived tan head that leaves huge swaths of lace all over the glass. The aroma is a wonderfully deep chocolate with notes of fresh toasted bread (like freshly ground light roast coffee beans) and an subtle and sublime earthiness. The flavor starts full of chocolate with bittersweet notes that include vinous barley malt tang as well as heavily sweetened dark roasted coffee - vaguely reminiscent of espresso sweetened with Frangelico (though not really so hazelnutty). The finish is full towards the back of the palate and then turns to dryness as it finally rolls into the gullet. Lots of chocolate character, but no burnt or acrid character at all - very smooth and fairly sweet as well, with some subtle bitter flavors of ethanol creeping in. The aftertaste is malty with lots of chocolate. The mouthfeel is quite creamy and full-bodied - luxurious but for notes of thinness around the edges of the mouth. The carbonation is fairly soft and provides just enough levity to make it feel fluffy and creamy. Overall, a very well-done porter - quite drinkable. Were it a little drier and a little less sweet, it would be even better.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

The head that appears is initially nice and level, about an inch thick, and tan.  Nice lacing develops as the beer disappears.  The taste is rich with lots of very good roasted sugars and coffee.

Aroma: Aroma is strong on roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate

Appearance: Pours a thick, dark brown color with a light brown head

Flavor: Flavor is roasted malts with a bit of earthy hops

Palate: The body is medium-full, thick, with soft carbonation

Overall Impression: 
Overall this is a pretty good Porter.  It has the thick, dark pour of a heavy stout.  Its pretty much what you would have expected from the style with its massive malt nose that leads to a massive malt (with a little hop) flavor.  Still though, it is pretty good, and certainly enjoyable, another nice beer from Founders.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
153,"2009-12-09",3.4,"Bottle. Stout-like black with a  foamy medium-dark tan head, with good retention. Nose of some dry malt, maybe a little hops. Flavor sweet up front and chocolaty, with maybe a tiny hint of coffee-like bitterness. Definitely let this one breathe a bit after pouring, because at first it had a somewhat acrid bitter flavor. It becomes fairly smooth and clean, but the bitter flavor doesnt really leave the aftertaste. Good porter, but not as fully dimensional as Black Butte, which is my standby porter. I suppose this is more of a British style porter, though, rather than a robust one.","Houston, Texas, USA","jumpjet2k"

153,"2009-12-03",4.2,"From a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours with an inch of gray/brown head which dissipates quickly leaving a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is of dark coffee.  Taste is of hard core coffee and chocolate.  Kinda that taste of over roasted Starbucks coffee.  Chocolate is also very prevalent.  Mouthfeel is very thick, almost bordering on a stout (but hey, whats the difference).  Overall, this really is the stepson of Founders Breakfast stout, but without the chocolate flavor.  I very much liked this beer although it was on the thick side for a porter.  The flavor was also too biased towards coffee and without any other flavors.

Pure black (the blackest Porter I have ever seen), with very thin tan head and just a touch of lacing.

The aroma is chocolate galore, with some licorice, roasted malt and coffee. 

Very chocolaty and rich. Noticeable licorice and maybe some fruitiness. Somewhat bitter finish, seems to be more from roasted malts than hops.

Exceedingly smooth full body, slightly chewy, low carbonation (almost flat). Love the smoothness, but not the flatness.

Despite the richness of the beer, it is quite easy to sip. Delectable.

The body definitely seems more like a Stout, but I guess the lower levels of roasted barley keeps things in Porter territory. Kind of a hybrid, as if there wasnt enough confusion between Porters and Stouts already.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

The nose gives strong hints of roasted malt, with a nod especially to what seems to be  a relatively low lovibond chocolate malt.  The palate is distinctly roasted and malty up front, showing dark chocolate notes.  The mid-palate shows a nice west coast hop presence.  It stops short of having the assertive character of an American stout, but is far more than what would be seen in a standard English robust porter.  One thing that could further improve what is a fairly complex palate would be the increased use of mid-range crystal malts.

First time trying this one, looks good with a thin but lasting brown head over a very dark brown liquid.  Scent is roasted coffee, chocolate, very similar to the Imperial stout, not quite as coffee centric as the breakfast stout, and molasses.  Quite phenomenal nose.  Flavor unfortunately isnt the slam dunk that the nose is, as we have a good solid porter, but it misses the perfect nuanced taste of its bigger brothers.  There is certainly more hop presence than in the stouts, but not nearly as much as a Yeti or Rasputin.

Incredible palate, perfect creamy thickness.  Cant believe this is only $9 for a sixer.  Anchor Porter and Fullers London Porter are great for the price but this is my new go-to affordable porter.

I have had another Founders brew recently, an IPA, which I rather enjoyed, so I am looking forward to testing their porter. Porters in general are a very enjoyable beer style for me; smooth, rich, creamy, ripe with chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits to name a few. What is there not to like would be the better question.


Just as I imagined, she poured thick black like an oil field rupturing into my glass with a soft, puffy tan head. Rocky and unpretentious, she fades into large clumps of creamy tan beauty while lace cracks and crackles under the assault of dark coffee beans and earthy Belgian chocolates being roasted above a fire of charcoal, wood, and smoke. Divine inspiration, if I do say so myself. But wait, there is more. plump, juicy, decadent prunes, raisins, licorice root and heavy dark breads are there to sop it all up into one gooey mess which calls me for to dive in. whoever said dark fruits are for old folks obviously didnt know what they are missing. Not one to keep a good porter waiting, I draw deep for my first quaff and practically melt into my chair. Smooth and velvety with just a gentle whisper of fresh cream as she glides down my throat like the finest of silks. Vanilla, coconut, and soft wood ground while lemon zest tingles on top of my tongue. Melting into her creamy lactic currents are melted chocolates, prunes, raisins, and fresh espresso with the prunes and licorice root lingering longest. Finishing her palate is prune juice that quickly dries into charcoal and burnt wood. If that wasnt enough, long into her finish, chocolate blossoms exponentially, permeating my breath. Wow and Yum. Enough note taking; time to close my eyes as I savor the last few quaffs of my Founders Porter.


Chocolate may be the quickest way to some ladies hearts, but not mine. Ill take a Founders Porter any day, thank you very much. A solid porter and an easy recommend on my part. Many thanks to my blessed gifter of this fine brew, indeed.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

153,"2009-07-09",4.3,"Original review date 1/7/2009...

12 oz. into a Coronado Brewing Company pint glass...

Pours with a dark maple, root beer float-colored head - about 2 fingers thick but slims to 1 quickly with decent lacing. Body color is espresso dark with sparse carbonation at bottom. Enticing.

Slight bicarb and metallic tinge at first but it goes quickly and reveals a deep dark-roasted nuttiness - hazelnuts and peanuts mostly. Mild hoppiness of grass with a nuttier edge. Roasted malt really shines through.

Wow - nice slate-ish BBQ char up along with some mild licorice - bitter French roasted coffee brings about some nice cinnamon/brown sugar sweetness. Finish is very slatish with big chicory bitterness and hop grass.

Theres a fair amount of cleanliness to this even though its so damn robust. Smooth dark-roasted malt works well with the bitter coffee notes and quiet hop grass as well as the good slate an char. Slight alcohol sweetness - nice finish.

Some Porter examples feel too thin and metallic compared to a session stout. Not this one - this one can pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs - it stands well on its own with great flavor and depth, and it sessions up nicely.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

153,"2009-06-26",4.3,"THOUGHTS: A really nice porter. It was similar to Anchor Porter, but not quite the same. Also slightly like Weyerbacher Raspberry Imperial Stout without all the raspberry. Just great really. I cant really explain it. Everything just comes together well. Its like dessert and coffee after the meal. I need to get more. I only bought a single bottle, but this is worthy of a case purchase. I gave it a bonus point for being greater than the sum of its parts. I highly recommend this to porter, stout and beer fans in general.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was an opaque black in the glass with an average, light brown (the darkest Ive ever seen on a porter) head that mostly diminished, but left good lacing. Th aroma was moderate to heavy strong coffee, dark chocolate, roasted and burnt malts, and slight cream. The initial flavor was sweet and lightly bitter; while the finish was more sweeter and more bitter with an average to long duration. There was Hersheys Special Dark chocolate, a little fruit, coffee, roasted malt, a little burnt malt and a little hops. There was as much coffee bitterness as there was hop bitterness and it was hard to tell where one started and the other ended.

Great depth to the nose, lots of milk and bitter chocolate, roast, coffee, licorice, and a good bit of hops as well.  The hops grab me up front with dry roasty and chocolate malt taking over towards the back end.  A good deal of licorice and burnt malt lingering.  I like this, but its not among my favorite Porters.  Too roasty and burnt, I want something more chocolaty and less hoppy.  Mouthfeel is is medium bodied with a very dry, almost ashy feel to it.

Through the palate the same thread of cocao powder and roasted malt found in the breweries more powerful dark offerings can be found.  This porter gives the up front impression of weight and holds, as the round body offers a degree of polish.  As  we finish the palate lightens up gradually as the bubbles give this beer and uncanny lift.  Warm chocolate, slight mission fig sweetness and hop spice linger.  95","Charleston, USA","Bigsilky"

Delicious fragrance of chocolate, hazelnuts, coffee and roasted malt.

pours pitch black with a 1 finger coco brown head. smells of chocolate. tastes of roasted malt and chocolate with a nice hop bite in the finish. mouthfeel is creamy and light when compared to stouts which this beer kicks ass over lots of stouts.  this beer is almost a mirror image of breakfast stout without the coffee and is a tad lighter body. when you run out of breakfast stout this is your next best year round option and is half the price. this is in my top 5 of all time porters","Illinois, USA","jsh420"

Ooooooh, the first taste is overly strong, hey dudes, this is in the impy stout category, not porter!  Alky bitterness builds on the palate. Very little carbonation.

153,"2009-04-20",4.3,"12oz bottle courtesy of FtownThrowDown poured into a tulip.

This one poured dark, dark brown out of the bottle and settles in black with hints of mahogany around the edges.  An aggressive pour produces a smallish tan head that recedes to a ring quickly and leaves little lacing.

The aroma is stunning on this one with everything you could ever want in a porter.  Its got dark sweet malts, with lots of chocolate and hints of roasted coffee.  Its also got plenty of sweet dark fruits and hints of caramel, vanilla, and even a hint of hops.  One of the best aromas Ive had on a porter.

The taste is only a small step behind the aroma in my book.  Its definitely sweet with lots of dark chocolate malts and molasses sweetness.  Tastes like a dessert with a splash of coffee infusion.

The mouthfeel is full-bodied with low, soft carbonation and just completely coats the mouth with the dark sweet malts.  Decadent mouthfeel overall, especially for the style.

Quite simply, one of the best porters Ive ever tasted.  The nose is world-class and the taste and mouthfeel are pretty damn close.  Im not sure if Ive ever had a beer with more flavor at this ABV level.  Wonderful stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

153,"2009-04-19",3.9,"Bottle, Friar Tuck, Savoy. Ive enjoyed this barrel aged and with maple. Its nice to see the standard version in the bottle. This is really an exceptional porter, much better than the standard go-to porter of Fullers, and much more drinkable than the Alpha Klaus, which I also appreciate. The nose is dominated by semi-sweet chocolate with a touch of anise and a surprising note of chamomile that doesnt show up on the palate. Palate is viscous with bittersweet chocolate dominating, added to notes of cardamom and robust molasses.

Founders Porter has a big and almost chewy body... really thick for a porter.... this one flirts with being a stout.  There are big roasted malts, lots of chocolate and a good level of bitterness throughout the mouth.  Some dark fruit notes come forward as well including raisins and dark currants.

153,"2009-02-25",4.3,"12oz bottle: Deep black pour with a rising, tan head that settles into a thick whipped top after a few minutes.  The aroma is complex and hits all the right notes for me for the style. A healthy dose of freshly ground coffee starts things off, with a meandering hint of baked brownies and sweet chocolate cutting through the roastiness from time to time.  Roasted almonds and vanilla also come to mind as the beer warms.  The body is just as complex, with equally interesting mix of fresh press, cocoa, dark nuts and more. Very hoppy, which is nice to balance the blanket of malts. Very creamy and full on the tongue. A very nice example of the style - it reminds me of the first time I tried Arcadias London Porter years ago.  I hope this one stays around as well as it will be great to pull a fresh six from the shelves from time to time. Do not pass this up.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

The flavor is roastier with only mild burnt black patent malts present, otherwise much the same as the aroma.  Dry finish with bitterness peaking around a 3.

The nose is big, rich, and roasty, with notes of bittersweet dark chocolate, espresso, lactic cream and bitter earthy hops all working wonderfully together.  As great as the aroma is, this stuff tastes even better.  Dark cacao nibs and rich chocolate fudge blend superbly with silky smooth oatmeal nd heavy cream.  There are some mocha-chocolate milkshake tendencies here that are just decadent.  Medium-full, rich, smooth and creamy, I cant think of another 6.5% beer that feels this good on the palate.

153,"2009-02-21",4.0,"(bottle) Been wanting to try this one for awhile.  Pours jet black with a thin dark tan head that leaves plenty of web-like lacing on the snifter.  Aroma is strong with roasted malt, tons of chocolate, and berry skin.  Once in awhile, upon an initial sniff, I catch a whiff of burnt popcorn that detracts a bit from the other pleasant smells.  There is also a subtle touch of smoke here with roasted peanuts and salt.  The taste is nicely roasted malt with a very long-lasting finish of chocolate coupled with espresso.  That burnt popcorn again shows itself in the flavor, which is a shame.  Other than that, the taste is simple, but its really well executed.  A really smooth, silky mouthfeel.

153,"2009-01-23",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2009 1/23/2009:  If anything, Founders Porter definitely has a ""dark, rich & sexy"" appearance.  The rich, dark,  chocolate brown liquid has a really smooth and sexy pour from the bottle.  There is a small tan head that coats the surface.  The roasty aroma contains rich dark chocolate and smooth coffee.  The flavor is also quite roasty, but is has a softness to it that is unexpected and welcomed.  There is a really rich, dark chocolate flavor, cocoa, and the finish is much like espresso.  This beer has a medium-full body and is smooth and a bit creamy on the palate.  Overall this is an excellent robust porter that is bursting with wonderful flavor, has a fair amount of depth, and is very satisying!

12 fl. oz. short twist-off bottle (45 IBUs, 6.5% Alc. by Vol.) from Tmoney99.  Thank you!  I appreciate it.  Rating #144 for this beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

Taste is very richly roasted, dark bitter chocolate, roasted coffee beans, bitter charred malt, and just really nice.  A pretty substantial amount of bitterness either from the hops or the charred malt.  Body is medium to full with medium carbonation.  Damn tasty and easily one of the best porters Ive had.

Love the thick, deep-throated malt.  Pitch pour with a picture-perfect beige rocky head, lovely lacing and cloud formations.  Fat body, dry and smooth and just all around pleasant (though a little worty).More refined second bottle warrants the extra 0.4.  Loads of sexual chocolate and surprisingly subtle roast.  As solid as they come.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Smell is huge, very full bodied, plenty of coffee and chocolate in it.  Some hops as well, but not very strong in that aspect.  Flavor is very thick, almost dominated by coffee.  Kind of is like breakfast stout but not as thick or with THAT much coffee.  Really good porter, one of the better ones I have had really.  Almost to the level of an imperial porter, but the ability to be able to session this beer leaves it in the normal porter category.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

Pretty much how a porter should smell. Light toffee sweetness in the start. Middle is more acidic with the black malts taking charge. Some espresso and ashes. Light and smooth in feel. A nice return of base malt in the linger along with a touch of black malt bitterness. Strong flavored.

Excellent aroma, not too thick on the mouthfeel; deep, roasty feel and plenty going on.  The 45 IBU is right about where it should be-- I could enjoy this a bit less bitter, but it really balances things out to keep any sweetness from becoming cloying.

Lively carbonation like a lot of Founders brews, but nothing that detracts from the oily and appetizing qualities of the beer. Serious dark roasts and chocolate malts in the nose. Its the kind of description thats par for the course in a porter rating, but it doesnt quite do justice to the way this brew just nails the style.

A great aroma.  Tastes the same as it smells.  This beer is seriously just as good as the Breakfast stout. Slick, smooth, creamy body. This is remarkable, especially for the price.

This was the second best beer of the night - the first being the post dessert Kentucky Breakfast Stout.  Apparently the plan is to re-release this at some point in the next twelve months.  I cant wait.  If it is anything like the glass that I got to try it should be a very rich and complex porter.  I can see why it is one of the best on the site.  I was told however by Founders that it was 6.8% ABV.
Aroma / Appearance - An ashen head lingered above a fluid oily black body.  Sticky lacing trickled down the sides smoothly.  Smoke, black coffee, vanilla cream and a general sweetness mingled in a way that was somehow still light and airy.  Everything I expected in a porter was present.
Flavor / Palate - Hazelnut and blueberries tickled the tongue.  Afterwards I picked up chocolate, coffee with a trace of milk and caramel.  A smoky finish wrapped up an excellent time.  Easy drinking at 5% I could see having two or three over the course of a night.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Dark tobacco and a tannic dark fruit flavor dusted in bakers chocolate; really pure and rich without copping out in deep end, heavy decadence.  A floral touch of bittersweetness that lingers in lightly with an unexpectedly lovely herbal quality; this lends an imaginative, subtle vibrancy thats quite endearing.  Full, acidic, heavy coffee flavor never leans into astringency, but stays fresh and bold.

153,"2008-05-08",4.4,"Growler, via artusory.  Thanks, Ryan!  Pours a very dark, slightly oily chocolate brown; medium brown head with solid retention and fine-bubbled lacing, coating the glass; great pour.  Lots of chocolate, cocoa, and even some caramel in the aroma; very pleasant; no chalkiness, just dark chocolate and a bit of mineral bitterness.  I could drink the entire batch of this: medium-to-full mouthfeel: oily, velvety presence in the mouth; perfect mouthfeel; chocolate, cocoa, and zesty mineral bitterness without the slightest astringency or chalkiness; beautifully done beer: generous, chocolatey, and incredibly drinkable.  I cant think of a better example of the style that Ive had; even something like Olfabrikken goes so far it becomes something beyond a standard porter; this is, in contrast, for me, an archtype of the style.

153,"2006-08-20",3.8,"Draught pint at Redbones on 8/13/06.Small, but modestly retained medium-tan head is perched lightly atop a deep tan-brown-black body, with high opacity.  It eventually fades to partial cover, and ring, but leaves some lacing in trail.What could be mistaken for diacetyl, is actually just a creamy, yet bittersweet mix of malts producing a butterscotch-like note.  Some toffee, bit of roast and almost a touch of lactic acid or something similar.  It is braced by some medium-dry chocolate notes, a smattering of juicy green hops that are deeply floral and woven in to the background of the aroma.  Overall, a rather weak strength of aroma, with some nutty yeast blandness and a dash of acrid roast.But the flavor bears little resemblance to the aroma.  Toffee/butterscotch is smoothed in to a warm chocolate chip cookie flavor, with pale sugars, pleasingly bitter, but not in-your-face hops, and a finishing roast that is dry and lightly vinous, more flavorful than bitter.  Attenuation tends slightly to the sweet side, for the style, but by no means is it too sweet, and certainly the beer is quite drinkable.  Thick, like many of Founders dark beers, with a moderate to low carbonation on draught, keeping it creamy.  The hops really add a good side of balance, more cascade-like citric/floral notes, though held in check by the malts.  Alcohol not apparent, bit of fresh yeast flavor.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

153,"2006-03-13",3.9,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained 15-Jul-05 in trade with Pailhead, thanks Kevin!) The label says ""Dark, Rich & Sexy"".  Well, its definitely dark, pouring pitch black in color, even along the edges.  Its also very rich in flavor and body, boasting equally massive doses of dark, bitter roasted malts and lightly sweet chocolate for a full-bodied and very satisfying mouthfeel.  But sexy?  Well, it offers good, long-lasting head out of the bottle, does that count as sexy?  Tall, creamy, light brown in color, it leaves spotty and patchy lacing around the glass.  The nose presents fairly intense aromas of dark roast and sweet chocolate, but though quite nice, it doesnt blow me away.  Its the flavor that does that.  The chocolate is like eating a quality bar of dark chocolate, lightly sweet, long-lasting flavor.  Dark roasted but not burned, bitter, lightly hoppy even, this is an exceptionally well-made and well-balanced porter that really pushes into Imperial Stout territory, but without the higher alcohol.  Definitely a beer worth trading to get more just for special events and tastings.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Big chocolate roasty smell. By the time I get to tasting this, its gone a little thin, more like a nitro stout. Light Brit mouthfeel cant compensate for deep roasty black malts.

Flavors are not the let down that some of these great smelling porters are for me.  Less of the sweetness here and more of the expected dark roast, slightly bitter smokiness.  Fairly thin porter like feel but smooth. Fairly dry finish

Cocoa and chocolate interplays are accompanied by a light dose of lactic acid, well contained surprisingly. Ample hops fortunately do not create a spoiling citric aspect. Suggestion of smokle and beans add to its charms.

Roasted malty chocolate and coffee flavors, nice dry burnt bitterness in the finish, a good porter I would like to try again.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
153,"2004-01-14",4.4,"Pours like 10W40 (and I mean that in a good way).  Enticing look of black opaque body and thick tan head.  Aroma of chocolate and coffe roasted together.  Rich mocha flavor.  Excellent brew.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
153,"2003-12-20",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2011 A very nice looking porter, black with a large, rich, medium brown head.  Head fades a bit too quickly for top marks.  Nose is also nice, with both roast and chocolate qualities.  Flavor is very much dominated by bitter roasted flavors, leaving the chocolate to the background.  A nice porter, overall.    

RE-RATE: Though Ive had this out of a bottle, previously, I was able to sample it on draught and it was a different brew.  More pronounced chocolate flavors throughout.  Quite delicious really and a bit more polished than the bottled version.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
153,"2003-12-15",4.0,"Deep reddish brown hue with good frothy head abd very good lace. The aroma hints of nuts, mocha, molasses, smoke, coffee and aromatic hops. The taste is mostly bittersweet chocolate and acidic fruit with a nice touch of smoky dryness upon the finish. While the body is thin, the mouthfeel is still creamy and smooth. An excellent porter with all the qualities I look for. Complex enough for the beer geek, smooth enough to drink 2 or 3 of in one night.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
153,"2003-12-14",3.8,"On draft at brewpub.  Sat black and opaque in the glass topped with a thick and creamy tan head.  Mild smokey malt aroma.  Flavor of burnt molasses and chocolate malts with a bitter hop finish.  Full bodied and creamy carbonation - nice porter!","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
153,"2003-11-24",3.9,"GABF '03 Intense full bodies beer.Rich and malty,with a roasted and chocolate note.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
153,"2003-11-23",4.1,"Oil black body with rim remnants of a nicely tanned head. Smells like chocolate malts, coffee, toffee. It tastes awesome, almost a cross between a porter and an Imperial Stout. Wonderful burnt marshmallow flavor, coffee and deep dark chocolate. It has a hoppy finish. Like the bottle says it is dark, rich, and sexy. Great Porter.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","thehoff"
153,"2003-06-08",3.7,"One definition for porter is ""janitor,"" which I do say is a fitting epithet for a style lurking in the shadow of its elder sibling, the stout.  That said, this porter is a nice addition to the Founders line.  Dark and malty, with a rich roasted/burnt aroma and flavor of coffee and chocolate.  If you like this porter, hit the brewery and try the Breakfast Stout if it is available; the stout is like a supercharged version of this porter.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
153,"2003-03-18",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2003 roasted coffee aroma, dark, mirky appearance. Tastes a little malty with a strong chocolate/coffee flavor. Not an outstanding porter, but not that bad.  Like the bottle says, its 'sexy'.","Seattle, Washington, USA","AlabastorJones"
153,"2003-03-09",4.0,"Great creamy mouthfeel, an exercise in chocolate malting, great hoppy balance, hits the finish on the lips wonderfully. The perfect session porter, as something like Fuller's would get too thick and sweet I think, after a while.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
153,"2003-01-28",3.9,"Roasted chocolatey nose hovering above the rich black body.  The initial flavor is somewhat unnoticeable, covered by the robust palate which finishes smooth and malty with almost a burnt aftertaste.  Goes down remarkably smooth for its viscosity.  A very good porter.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
153,"2003-01-14",3.8,"Weird first porter that I can smell the roast malt.  Very dark in appears.  Taste like a chocolate stout to me.  Very drinkable.  Love hops but I cant taste them at all.  I think this beer would be a good one to age.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
153,"2003-01-12",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2009 Dark brown with a thick dirty head, this is a tasty brew
Some burnt/roasted notes on the nose; dry & bitter on the palate. A nice, tasty porter.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"

153,"2002-10-15",3.4,"This was a decent porter. Could have been alittle more malty.  About the same quality as an Edmund Fitzgerald.","East Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","DankbrewedDank"
153,"2002-08-12",3.8,"Since this beer caused at least one rater to muse on Michigans best porters, Ill weigh in here, too.  The best porter in Michigan, imo, is Arcadias eccentric London Porter.  Equally eccentric and interesting, though a touch rougher around the edges is Dark Horses Black.  That leaves this beer and Bells Porter lagging behind in third and fourth: more mundane, hop tinged affairs - decent, darkly edged, and satisfying but - well, not unusual enough to reach the top echelon of the peninsulas porters.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
153,"2002-07-29",4.0,"Nice coffee and chocolate malt taste. A nice amount of hops also. This is  a solid porter.","FLINT, Michigan, USA","pauliefrog99"

153,"2002-03-18",4.5,"What a great thing to find hidden in my brother-in-laws fridge!  He didnt know where it camve from, but I sure enjoyed it!  Compares nicely with Bells and Guiness.  A bit sweeter and more chocolate then Guiness. It ranks high on my list!","Michigan, USA","Aggie80"
