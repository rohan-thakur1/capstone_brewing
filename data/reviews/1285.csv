1285,"2015-10-27",3.7,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass.

Appearance: pours a 1"" off white head that falls quickly with just a hint of lacing. Color is mostly clear copper with mild streaming carbonation.
Aroma: malt dominate -- bread dough and a bit of toffee. Hops are floral with a little citrus rind as well.
Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied with a fluffy ale mouthfeel. Finish is dry and somewhat boozy.
Flavor: toasted bread, toffee, raisin and other ripe fruit. WIth a lingering floral, citrus rind, and even a bit of pine hops.
Overall: a very good and enjoyable ESB -- although the 6.5% is a little high as the BJCP guidelines top out at 6.2% -- thus the beer is a little too boozy and would be limited for sessionability.","Wyoming, USA","foyle"

Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

My second sampling of this and happily its as good as my first impression...it looks like someone actually put some effort into this one, which is becoming rarer and rarer at Full Sail sadly. Its enticingly cookie-ish and apricotty, and while it starts sweet (in a nice lip-smackin way), theres quite a bit of apparent bitterness in the finish (only 35 IBU, really?), so its quite delightful to drink.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Finish is drier but the buttery/-scotchy flavors linger (along with what feels like Burtonization), theres some moderate malt complexity here even, hard crystal included. Flavor/aroma-wise, hops are low and on the danker/herbal side, but match well until the woody/rubbery character is all that remains.

1285,"2014-07-01",3.2,"This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance has a hazy yet mostly transparent bronzed amber color. The head was about a finger and a halfs worth of white foaminess. Theres a light somewhat speckled lacing trying to show its face, but the head must last for at least a good minute before the lacing can actually be seen.
The smell has a fairly decent light apple with a light vanilla and light English maltiness running about my nose in a powerful sort of way.
The taste takes those previously mentioned flavors to balance with a slight bitterness very underneath (Fuggles hops, I think, I could be wrong, but I think thats what they are). The aftertaste is very bitter and dry and has a decent crisp feel into the finish.
On the palate, this one really wanted to sit at a light, but somehow showed a quality that wanted to sit at medium. Sessionable, kinda yeah, I could see it. The carbonation is really smooth if that helps.
Overall, in my opinion, well, this was a fairly good ESB worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

A - Pours a clear copper with a dense off-white head

S - Sweet bread, caramel, very sweet and bready, tangy fruit, apple, nutty yeasty, hints of alcohol, very British aroma.

T - Hops upfront, grassy with a hint of citrus, caramel malt rushes in providing a full balanced sweetness, notes of toffee and toasted grain as well. Some weird artificial notes come up but are very faint. Hints of apple and creamy vanilla come in giving way to a strong tea tannin bitterness. Grassy and herbal hops sing into the finish. The finish pushes heavy tannins that linger on the palate long after.

M - Low carbonation, medium full body, creamy feel with a tannin dry finish

Great stab at the style. Nice homey caramel malts that showed grain notes with some fruit notions. Everything worked except for the hints of artificial flavors that faintly showed up. Very good but not quite what youd find in the UK. I would pick up a six of this anytime.

The ""bitter"" is comprised of a roasted malt front that comes in strong, followed by caramel, sugar, and a note of honey that mellow the flavor nicely. Mild hops sweep in on the finish, balancing this brew perfectly. Roasted malts linger long on the palate. This is a proper Bitter that rightfully claims to be ""Extra Special"".
Light to medium weight and hardy carbonation make this beer lively and refreshing. This beer can be enjoyed in Spring, Summer, and Fall. It has characteristics that would compliment all three seasons.
Overall, this is easily one of my favorite Bitter styles. Its robust roasted malts and lack of over-the-top sweetness make it manly as hell.

1285,"2010-04-15",3.8,"Tap at the Steelhead Grill in Seattle. Ive been looking for this beer for something like five years, and finally managed to just stumble upon it. Nice copper pour, decent head. Rich and proper ESB depth, fruity and enjoyable, with an abundant c-hop presence, leaving the beer both undeniably an ESB and at the same time decidedly a PacNW brew. Very good!","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Nicely balanced mixture of a rich caramel malt, while using a more traditional hop background for the style giving it a unique English presence on the palate.  Very crisp and clean with a slighty bittersweet finish.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

Taste is mild lemon, bitter grass, floral hops - more west-coast hops style than I was expecting for an ESB (though I guess why not, right?).","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

1285,"2002-06-06",5.0,"As far as I know, this beer is only available at the brewery, on tap.  Its an exquisite beer--bright hop notes are married perfectly with the slight malt sweetness and Full Sail yeast.  Its fairly hoppy for an ESB, but Id call it a near-perfect beer.  My favorite beer from my favorite brewery.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Troobie99"
