4532,"2014-11-08",3.8,"Weird beer but a tasty one. Light tartness, a bit of sweetness, some grassy hop character. Draft at EBF 2013 NotB.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
4532,"2013-09-14",3.6,"Yellow, with a loose white head. Man, the wine barrels take to this like stink on poo. Huge white wine aroma, pretty much overpowering everything else. Flavor is also very winey, with subtle hints of oak, fruit, and grassy hops. Pretty tasty, though...","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
4532,"2013-08-02",3.7,"Draft @ Dutchs May 2013. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma is grassy, toasted bread, heavy chardonnay barrel influence, wood, white grapes. The flavor is much of the same. It is almost a completely different beer due to the barrel.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
4532,"2013-07-03",3.8,"it had a tart, cidery, aroma and flavor, a seemingly very light body. the wine barrel really imparted a lot of wine character -- quite refreshing.","new york, New York, USA","bob_w"
4532,"2013-06-03",3.7,"Draft. Poured clear yellow color with an average white frothy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate hop, sweet wood and yeast aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet woody finish of moderate to long duration. Good drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4532,"2013-05-24",3.8,"Growler. Clear golden pour, no head. Aroma had a big white grape presence, sweet corn and bready malts. A slight tartness from top to bottom, the wine grapes leave a lasting impression. Slightly sweet, touch of vanilla and oak. Light carbonation, thin mouth. Tasty and interesting.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
4532,"2013-05-14",3.7,"On tap at Dutchs. Totally hazy bright yellow color. Nice thin white head with good retention, leaves good lace. Medium body. Nice very smooth kind of airy lighter carbonation. More dry in the finish. Great easy drinking texture. Nice white grape aroma. Adds a big refreshing lightly tart element to this pils. Barely tastes like a pils, though, which some style-nazis might get hung up on. Might be more accurately described as a fruit beer, but who cares. Nice light tart taste to it from the white grape and wood, makes this pils even more refreshing than the original. Some bready pilsner malts, light hops still noticeable in the base. Interesting, tasty, unusual, enjoyable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
4532,"2013-04-18",3.9,"Hazy orange pour, small white head.  Aroma has some nice Chardonnay notes and taste is accentuated by that flavor.  Very enjoyable.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
4532,"2013-04-09",3.4,"Super oaky/vinous.  Almost buttery with oak. Soft cloudy straw yellow pour with a fizzy white head.  Flavor gets grassy and almost vegetal.  Too much oak.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
4532,"2013-04-03",3.7,"Couple pints at Sams, Durham, a while back. Thanks, Ben! Pours considerably more cloudy than the bright gold base beer, with a fairly minimal head (big, clear, cider-like bubbles though). Nice nose, the kind of aggressive Cali oaking that I dont so much dig in wine itself but which tends to find a harmony with the dry noble hops here. Light prickly in the mouthfeel, just a touch acetic in places. Flavor comes across as subdued funk, integrated well into the pils, fruity and sharp at once. Enjoyed it.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
4532,"2013-03-31",3.6,"(Critique chaotique du extreme beer fest 2013): Un jus de pomme qui écorche un peu le palais au passage, rafraichissant, interessant.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
4532,"2013-03-22",3.7,"Pouring at the Night of the Barrels at Extreme Beer Fest.  Pours a clear amber with a thin white head.  Fruity, grapes and grape juice all over the nose, soft wood.  Medium bodied, sweet, grainy with some wood.  Picks up some musk and toast into the finish, more wood.  Surprisingly good.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Light body, thin mouthfeel crisp Fruity finish. Its ok, I mean, theres a nice.level of the barrel and the pils, but its not one Id want a bunch of.

4532,"2012-08-16",3.3,"On tap at Tasty Weasel 08/11/2012.  Hazy light gold with a thin white head. Typical Chardonnay aroma with a nice yeasty malty undertone, and a touch of white oak.
