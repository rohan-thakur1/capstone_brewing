4296,"2016-10-30",3.5,"Draught pint at The Rock in Beloit, WI, October 29th. Very clear medium gold with a fully lasting smallish snow-white head...reasonably expressive malt-forward lightly sweet aroma, touches of dry hay and thistle and thyme but overall subtle and with the accent always on the grain...body is a little more hoppy that I might have expected from that sweetish nose, though there is just a bit of residual sugar here at the front and that helps the strong noble hop character (just 24 IBU? really?) to keep the bittering even at the finish well within expected norms; unlike say the Surly Hell this never feels like anything but what it is...on the palate it is alas a bit flaccid, not quite watery but just above water; carbonation level is right on. While I liked this a lot overall it just doesnt quite measure up to the top examples Ive had; given how much I like the style and that there arent many great choices available to me here though, Im sure Ill be having it again.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Nice lace to boot.  The aroma is very soft and creamy--pale malt, vanilla, and grassy hops.  The flavor is quite pleasant also.  Sweet malt, almost fruity upfront, followed by a nice grassy resinous hop bitterness.  Medium dry finish.  No hint of alcohol.  Light body with low carbonation, which I enjoy.

4296,"2008-09-28",3.0,"My Bottom Line:
This modest Helles proposes lightly toasted malts and feeble hoppiness enlivened by a soft prickling for a polite but mostly forgettable session.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the hazy blond.
-The malt character is not very ""Franconian"" at all, and the hoppiness is not well developed enough for me to know what its trying to offer. Could be a freshness issue too?
-The subtle cereal sweetness is sometimes approached by watery notions.
-A distant citrusy spiciness comes from the hops.
-This is not very authentic and lacks inspiration, but it remains a clean and quaffable example of the style.

Noble hops abound, perhaps to much so. Dried flower flavors and light perfume. The malt does seem to get lost a bit. Some biscuit and scone flavors come to mind. Some green hops in the finish.

4296,"2008-02-06",3.9,"Hazy pale yellow. Large white head all but vanishes into a fine white ring. Pilsner malt yields an abundance of fresh hay and toasted dough aromatics. Very minerally with hints of honey, plastic and herbal hops (aniseed, sage). Plentiful carbonation harshly pricks the palate and deposits a slightly fuzzy residue. Body is full and unfiltered. Quenching acidity greets the palate before an onset of sharp plasticy phenols lends a scrubbing action. Slightly tinny though the full and well-rounded malt develops a vivid breadiness which smothers the phenols as it gradually softens. Brisk minerals are accompanied by a delectable bite of snappy pistachio-tinged yeastiness. Herbal hops are tightly integrated and beautifully lend their poignantly defined crispness and juiciness to the pillowy malt frame. Dab of caramelized sugars exudes briefly but the malt largely mimics notes and textures of damp honey-drizzled hay. Pils malt is voluptuously starchy and clingy and is highlighted by a lemony accent. The clean finish boasts a steady and lush foundation of toasted dough which lingers. Praise be to Ninkasi that they didnt filter this. Its just too bad about the harsh and acidic carbonation as it inhibits the cleanly extracted malt from fully capturing the spotlight.  The phenols add an interesting element, and impart more liveliness rather than becoming too much of a detraction to me. Quality stuff.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

I am not sure what I was expecting when I cracked open the bottle but this was not it.  After some adjustment I began to enjoy the contents.  Unfortunately it was a bit of a letdown.  At $5.00 it wasnt a total waste though I can think of other beers I would choose instead.  Pass on this one unless you really must try every 3F release.
Aroma / Appearance - The transparent golden body had a nice carbonation that showed there was still life to the contents.  A one finger bleached white head sat above.  Graininess, honey and malts formed a nose that I found far too simplistic even for a dortmunder. Imagine eating a slice of white bread without any toppings.
Flavor / Palate - Golden grahams, honey and a light maltiness rush across the tongue in an attempt to disappear quickly.  It was predictable and somewhat boring.  Perhaps this is Three Floyds version of Totally Naked - a beer that is reliable, safe and approachable by people used to Budweiser.  That audience does not include me.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

To me this beer tastes like you ate a handful of European hops, drank 4 bombers of Gumball head, pissed in a bottle, capped it, and called it Gorch Fock.  I come to expect alot from FFF, as do most people (I believe), and for them to release something like this is just disappointing, and it hurts the wallet.  Sean left the sticker on this, presumably so I could be in shock.  10 bucks?  ok, whatever I am sick of the FFF is expensive argument too, but for 10 bucks I would buy Dreadnaught all day before even considering this.

Light fresh and wet hay/straw notes increase in potency with every degree of warmth. Star Thistle honey notes create a near-tangible link between malt and Eastern European noble hop nuances.

The flavor is filled with buttery sweet malts a medium and very balanced expression of grain, supported by ample and genuine hop bitterness. Light pepper and very low astringency and acidity lend to mostly refreshing feel. Herb butter and spicy yeast arrive late. The mouthfeel is lowly carbonated and velvety, but too oily and weighty to feel refreshing, medium bodied and inconsistent. This is very drinkable but too muddled and filmy.

4296,"2007-09-02",3.8,"Bottle.  Have been holding onto this on for about two weeks, and I dont know why exactly...oh, right, a steep $10 / bomber.  Nose is malty, of the truly German type (slightly peppery and spicy), mixing bread and grass and gentle bg hops.  Very authentic smelling.  Clear, pale yellow pour with no visible carbonation and a fizzy, soapish white head.  Taste is all about the pale malt, and this sucker is loaded with it, spilling over with it, finally finishing in a cascade of bread and grass and lemon.  Spicy yeast and superb hopcit.  Dry, bready aftertaste.  Medium-fullish, quaffable body.  Enormously enjoyable and refreshing.  Nice low abv for FFF, too, earning this one top-notch status for summer sessions.  Rating this seems to be a bit of a tough call; I think more of you would be scoring this in the high 3s if you werent still grumbling about how goddamn expensive it is.  Notice I went with ""high 3s""; this is no masterpiece, but an excellent brew and a potentially best-of-show Helles.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

4296,"2007-08-09",3.1,"On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub, and served in a pint glass.  This beer poured a clear, golden color with a small, beige head.  The aroma was made up of bread, very light pine, and some lemony citrus notes.  The flavor was also very mild and included light bready yeast and citrus.  The mouthfeel was light and had a small dose of carbonation.  A solid representation of the style.  Worth a try.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

4296,"2005-11-14",3.5,"Draft @ the brewpub.  Translucent orange in color with a pocked gray head, persistently creamy throughout the experience.  Fresh, aromatic wet hops, sourdough crust, honey wheat bread and lemon shortbread cookies.  Heartily moderate flavor, rolling over to light crescent roll yeast.  Lemon biscotti sweetness rivals fresh hops, with the latter tipping the boat towards one of the more pine indoctrinated renditions in the genre.  Medium-to-light palate feel while maintaining a fun, active and personable persona.  Some pils malt similarities to align itself within the helles parameters.  Finishes with sourdough, herbal butter and a slightly bitter kiss.  Enjoyable, easy drinker.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4296,"2005-11-12",3.3,"This beer arrives in a light golden color wearing a good thick head.  This thick head dissolves slowly leaving in its wake a substantial amount of lacing on the side of glass.  It presents a sour, nutty, and hoppy aroma to the sent glands.  The mouth welcomes this smooth thin mixture.  The taste is a mild blend of Brazil nuts and hops, but unfortunately this taste is disrupted by a slight metallic presence that can be detected in the background.","Champaign, Illinois, USA","RooftopRogue"
4296,"2005-11-06",3.1,"Draft at 3F. A nice straw amber color. Taste is some floral hops along with grass and dough. Eh. Nothing more to say.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"

This has the characteristic Three Floyds hop strength that left a little hop burn on the tongue.  Just hopped to hell for the style.  Tastey.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
4296,"2005-05-04",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2013 Re-rate March 2013, from bottle. Hazy, light orange body, medium off-white head. Skunky nose with biscuit and herbs, wheaty and spicy. Crackery, biscuity body with peppery, leafy, spicy hops. Complex and refreshing. I liked this quite a bit this time, served properly.

5/4/2005: Sampled this from its plastic cup in my in-and-out Dark Lord release visit.  Not necessarily to style, this poured a hazy light orangish yellow color, topped by a medium off-white head.  The body was quite grassy-hoppy, with some pine and a sweet, bready, lightly tangy malt backbone.  Quaffable, yet displayed typical house character.  I wasnt impressed or disappointed, but I was content. 7-3-7-3-14 (3.4).","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

4296,"2005-05-03",3.4,"Not a big fan of the style but this was pretty good.  From the tap at the brewery.  Golden amber body with a frothy white head.  Nose was herbal, hoppy, grassy, citrusy.  Nice and complex and rewarding in itself.  Nice feel in the mouth.  Smooth.  The flavor was well-balanced with good parts malts and hops.  Not a traditional respresentation of the style, which is probably why I liked it.  Very drinkable.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
4296,"2005-05-02",3.7,"Big grassy nose, really refreshing, Grassy bitterness and pretzelly maltiness.  Smooth, long bitter finish. I drank some while listening to the band Gorch Fock on my iPod, which certainly enhanced the experience.  Great gig poster on the Three Floyds wall, as well.  Think grassy Helles vs Three Floyds. Think Shellac vs Butthole Surfers.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
4296,"2005-05-02",3.9,"Clear Golden body with a foamy, rocky white head.   Great aromas.  Mildy malty, with hints of sourdough, grass, and classic Three Floyds citrus.  Well balanced flavors.  Rich with malty flavors and dry, herbal hop notes.  Citrus was present throughout, but never overwhelming or up front.  It just kind of lingers in the back.  This stuff is dangerously drinkable.","Reno, Nevada, USA","NVBeer232"
4296,"2005-05-02",3.7,"Very clear and golden with a great pils-type head. A nice grassy/spicy hoppy lager with a thirst quenching bitterness in the finish. For those interested in style, this is really too low in gravity to be a helles, too malty and over bittered--definitely an American take on the style. I wont take off for it but I just thought I might point it out.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
4296,"2005-05-02",3.4,"On tap at the brewwery. Nose is mostly hoppy with just a bit of malts or grains. The taste is hops and vegitations. Overall quite drinkable and pleasant.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
4296,"2005-05-01",3.6,"On tap: Golden hue with some head and good lace. The nose has grassy and herbal hops character, twangy fruit esters, bready malts, and a bit mineral component. The taste starts with a nice crisp bitterness and balanced malty background. An acidic like twang and lingering bitters add depth of palate. The feel is average but works within the style. A good version, a Floyds slightly hopped up take. I liked it a lot.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
4296,"2005-05-01",2.6,"Light yellow pour with a decent white head. The aroma has a lot of piney/earthy hops and the flavor doesnt have much malt to carry it as a Helles. A little disappointed with the amount of bitterness present.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"

4296,"2005-04-30",3.9,"#10 rating of this beer to put it on the list.  Aroma is grassy hops, caramel and toasted malts.  Appearance is tiny particles suspended in a piss yellow body.  Thick rocky head with excellent lacing and head retention.  First piss looking beer Ive given a 4 to on appearance. :)  Flavor is herbal and grassy hops, caramel, and something indescribable.  Palate is sweet with a medium mouth feel.  Excellent!  Pick this one up when it gets bottled (I hope it does).","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4296,"2005-04-29",3.7,"Draft, at 3Fs. A suprise for a Floyds beer. Yes, its incredibly hopped, but with German hops. Color is deep yellow, if I can call it that. A thin, lacy head; a fine helles malt profile with the Dortmunder hard water taste like a DAB. Pinprickly bubbles play well on the tongue. Be sure to try this one in between scarfing down Dark Lords.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

4296,"2005-04-29",3.3,"A thin pale ale look to this beer.  The aroma is a little sweet and the head is average.  Smooth, sweet, and crisp taste that reminds me of most of the 3floyd beers with the hop touch.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
4296,"2005-04-27",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Brought a pint glass with to the brewery. Yellowish with an off white head. The aroma is almost like noble hops, but the brewmaster said it was something crazy like warrior? Taste is slightly bitter, almost like a traditional euro lager. A nice example of this style, though certainly not within BJCP guidelines.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
4296,"2005-04-09",3.9,"This Alpha Dort is absolutely wonderful.

4296,"2005-04-08",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2005 3F should be bottling this brew for the Summer months.  Interesteing northwestern hopping to a Dortmunder, and I highly approve.  Lively carbonation, a head that does serious lacing, this is crisp in the mouth and all the way down the throat.  The malt eventually comes through, but the hops shine in aroma and taste -  pine, grapefruit, floral...  The snappy hop holds on for a lingering, mouth-watering, bitter finish.

4296,"2005-04-02",4.1,"Growler from Munster: hazed gold with a modest ivory foam.  Streams of bubbles cling to bottom of the glass and rise through as I set it downfluffy white lace forms quickly.  Fresh & sweet sappy hop aromatics, anticipation is that this would be too much, but I would suggest a strong pale malt presence that actually offers balance, thats right balance to the aroma of a 3Floyds brew!  Outrageously crisp palate, tinglingly bitter with a nice malted sweetness.  Refreshing and tasty, I hope they keep this one around for the warmer summer months.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
