A drinkable dunkel. Ive certainly had worse lagers! Although it initially smells predominantly of caramel and bready malts, the sweetness remains quite restrained and decently balanced. Despite the colour, its light-bodied, perhaps even tending to the watery, but thats not really a negative for the style. Id call this a straightforward thirst quencher, and one could certainly session it were one so inclined. (13/20)","CANADA","UXO"

1368,"2006-12-20",3.4,"On tap at Volo. Very dark but with a surprisingly light taste. Mouthfeel was foamy, in a creamy sort of manner, but it was fairly light. There was very little flavour to be honest. My friend loved it as his first dark beer, perhaps it is a starting point. But it felt like I was drinking richly flavoured foam. Not a bad beer altogether.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","RaphaelN"

1368,"2006-11-20",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2008 On tap at the Victory Cafe - came deep transparent brown.  Aroma of roasted malts and a bit of hoppiness too.  Flavours much the same, but with surprisingly light body given the colour of the beer.  Toasted black malt, some nice hoppy bite to balance and a lingering faintly bitter finish.  Refreshing.  An enjoyable pint, and Michaels work is most commendable.  Good show.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"

1368,"2006-02-25",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2006 Slightly sour malty scent, deep brown with a thin white head, nutty flavours and a pleasantly earthy, bitter bite to it. Could use a bit more body to sharpen the flavours. Had on draught at Victory, maybe not the best cask caretakers in town.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","shintriad"
1368,"2006-01-30",3.9,"draught at BeerBistro, as aperatif. Very enjoyably nutty and roasty malt, overall refreshing, stylish yet undemanding. Hops a little dry but not overly prominent. Good!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"
1368,"2005-07-16",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2007 Draught at Volo.  A clear red-amber with an off-white head.  Aroma interesting - sour yeast, wood, nutty malt, some hops, turpentine?  Flavour very wheaty/grainy, with roast malts, slighly harsh hop bitterness - medium bodied and a dark, oaky mouthfeel, tart and enjoyable.  Liked it much better than my first taste in Feb/Mar 05. ** update January 2007 - seems better than I remember - have to bump it a tad.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

1368,"2005-05-24",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2006 On tap, Volo.  Dark brown in the glass with a sizeable creamy tan head - a really lovely looking pint.  Aroma of malt, some spice, and a nice hop accent.  Medium bodies mouthfeel; malt taste but not in a sweet way.  Rich tasting, yet quite light and quaffable.  This is a very well put together beer - no one element jumps out at you, but what is there goes together quite nicely to make one of the best pints you can have in Toronto.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
1368,"2005-05-02",2.9,"Dark amber colour, sticky white head.  Very nice light fruity aroma, toasted malt, plums and a touch of chocolate.  Flavour however, was very weak and watery.  Light sweet malt but there was a strange waxy taste that I dont like at all.  Maybe this was off, but I had it at Volo like many others.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
