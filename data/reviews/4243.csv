4243,"2012-08-03",3.8,"Thanks to Brandon Chaney for hooking me up with a growler of this.

A: The beer looks pretty, and unsurprisingly appears the exact color of raspberries. There is a pinkish head of an eighth inch. This recedes hastily, leaving virtually no lacing behind. The carbonation level appears to be fairly low.

S: The aroma is all about raspberries.

T: The flavor is mostly sweet, with a slight tartness that occurs naturally from the raspberry itself. Theres a lot of fruit in this brew!

M: The feel is medium bodied and coats the palate. The beer isnt syrupy or viscous, per se, but does feel dense, in a way.

D: A good offering and very enjoyable.

4243,"2012-03-15",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/14/2011.  Poured from a 2L growler into a tulip. Thanks to Dunt for bringing this over.

There is no color to call this besides raspberry red. Solid all the way through, like it was a glass of raspberry juice. A small off-white head sits on top and fades to nothing as the glass goes on.

Sweet raspberries pop in the aroma. A little bit of tartness at the end. Nothing else really presents itself. 

The flavor starts out sweet and syrupy with a strong raspberry flavor. The raspberry flavor carries all the way through, blotting out any other flavors. If anything, it is a little sweeter than a raspberry, with just a little bit of tartness toward the end. 

Sweet and a little syrupy in the mouthfeel, with light carbonation and a fuller than medium body.

Good raspberry beers rank among my favorite style, and this definitely tastes like sweet raspberries, but there is just not the complexity to really drive this beer into the great category.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

First of all;  Aroma all red raspberry........Appearance; beautiful deep garnet with a whispy pink head........Full bodied but VERY drinkable.   The immense raspberry flavor was balanced by a substantial malty base.  The tartness of the berries again beautifully balanced by a slightly sweet malt.

4243,"2011-08-17",4.4,"Had this on-tap at the Selins Grove 14th anniversary party. Served into a goblet.

A - Pours deep, dark, red with a bright red, borderline pink, head that leaves light lacing down the glass.

S - Lots of tart raspberries up front that remain thru the duration. A touch of bready, doughy, malt from the base beer helps balance it a bit but this one is all about the fruit. A touch dull when first poured but it gets better and better as it warms.

T - The huge blast of tart raspberries up front is delicious. As they begin to let up you get some sweetness and you begin to pick up some of the breadyness from the base beer. It is a perfect compliment to all the sweet, tart, raspberries. Finish is more raspberry tartness that lingers for some time, but in a good way. Why cant all fruit beers be this way? Easily one of the best.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Creamy feel with a bit of lingering tartness from the raspberries. This one is smooth as velvet with just the right amount of sweetness.

O - Very, very, nice beer. I could put a few of these back no problem. A nearly perfect mix of tart raspberries and sugary sweetness. When it comes to fruit beers, Selins Grove can literally do no wrong. From this Framboise to the kriek and saison de peche, all are world class and some of the best in the style. If you have a chance to try any of them I suggest you do, you will not regret it.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

A light purple head, great retention and lacing, awesome...Great aroma os sweet raspberries(like you took some raspberries and squeezed them in your hand), sugar notes that are a touch candyish, with a tart finish. A little more tart then Raspberry tart, but still wish it was a stronger...The taste is a little of a letdown, the raspberries arent as sweet and dont come off as ""real"" as the aroma, but its more tart so its meeting some of wants on the nose. The tart is a little take to me, slightly medicinal raspberry finish.

4243,"2011-01-22",3.8,"Growler. Poured into a tulip glass a murky, bright maroon color with minimal head that collars around the glass. The head is actually a light pink color. The aroma is all raspberry, almost like I am smelling a raspberry jelly! The taste is massively sweet with some minimal bitterness in the end similiar to biting down on a raspberry seed or something like that.Really not that tart at all. Light/medium mouthfeel with some carbonation. It does have an odd taste in it that I cant quite put my finger on though that throws it off slightly for me. The 6.5% is not even noticeable at all over all the fruit flavors. Extremely easy drinking. Minimal lace at all. Well, its good if you just LOVE raspberries but its almost a little to much. Given the choice I would prefer the New Glarus raspberry beer over this.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"

4243,"2010-11-30",4.3,"At tap at Selins Grove - 01.29.2010

Poured a nice bright ruby-red with a nice white head and some good lacing as it went down. The smell was of pure raspberries--a bit tart with a lot of sweetness. The taste was quite similar--a little bit of acidity and tartness, but mostly just that pure raspberry flavor. As others have said, the brewery emphatically states that this is ""NOT"" a lambic, so it should not be judged as such. This is simply a very delicious fruit beer, rivaling Raspberry Tart, although not having quite as much complexity. The sweetness is played quite well, leading to a refreshing mouthfeel. Insanely drinkable--worth the three-hour drive in and of itself.

4243,"2010-01-07",3.5,"Growler, courtesy TheCheeseMan.  Pours a dark and cloudy, thick looking, deep garnet color.  A small, fading, pinkish-tan head leaves scant, skinny lines of jagged lacing behind.  The aroma booms with wild, jammy raspberry, very fruity and sweet-tart in a natural, fresh picked sort of way.  I dont really pull much out of the nose besides the raspberry.  Similarly, flavors are pretty one dimensional.  Primarily sweet, with just a hint of raspberry and cherry tartness, theres a faintly grainy background, though the jammy fruit runs the show.  Medium-plus in body and initially smooth, the finish turns towards the sticky side.  Nice fruit beer, just not my thing.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
