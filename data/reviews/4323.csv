4323,"2004-11-16",3.1,"Hand pulled at the Head of Steam, Euston, in the comapny of chris_o. Sweet coffee aroma. Very smooth cocoa, with a sweet, almost sickly finish. Very drinkable, but quite sweet.","Birmingham (via Leicester), West Midlands, ENGLAND","DanielBrown"
4323,"2004-11-05",3.4,"Hui - nice one. Wonderful nearly black color, small frothy head. Malt, chocolate and coffee nose. Kind of flat roasted coffee bean and malt taste - medium lasting.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
4323,"2004-10-31",3.8,"Complex, strong nose - nutty, woody and some molasses. Dark dark brown color with a low frothy head. Full warm sweet malt body with raisin and honey tastes. Tones of chocolate and toast all emerge in the background. Think with a very present alcohol component. Finishes like  brandy, then turns a little spicy. Hey - this is a good British beer!","GERMANY","pivo"
4323,"2004-06-29",3.9,"Bottle. Very tasty indeed. Spicy Christmasy sort of flavour. Raisiny, cakey, caramel/choc. With a nice dry acidic, salty, orange rindy, bitter finish, a fantastic beer, very tasty.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
4323,"2004-03-20",3.8,"Bottle conditioned. Deep red, bordering on black, thin but lasting beige head and good condition. Evolving aromas, starting with fruity vimto like berries, some orange citric notes, sweet malt and roast barley. A delicate hop aroma develops and a final hint of liquorice as it warms. In the mouth it is quite thick and malty with hints of fruity berries (blackberry, maybe) some roast barley and a background yeastiness. The roast and hops conspire in the finish to produce a good tingly bitterness that lingers well with traces of coconut at the end.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
4323,"2004-01-20",4.4,"Bottle Conditioned. Bought at Pig's Ear Festival. No Date.  A spanking Winter Warmer. Quality throughout. Roasty dark malts with just enough sweetness. Perfect condition. Lovely explosion of flavours that excite the mouth without ever being assertive or crude or overdone. Stunning!","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
4323,"2003-12-13",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2004 Rather similar to the Cottage Normans Conquest (q.v.) that I tried just before this. A dark, rich and complex ale, with obvious roasted malt character, that drinks far easier than the alcohol content (which in this case was 7%) would suggest. An excellent drop, although go easy if you want to avoid falling over. Handpump, Head of Steam, London NW1, December 2003
RE:RATE at the Wenlock Arms, Dec 2004. The alcohol has been upped to 7.8% and the beer definitely seemed to have more oomph. Increased the score a little","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
4323,"2003-12-11",3.4,"Bottled. Dark, dark brown with a thin, creamy head. Strong malt aroma, molasses, and more raw malt. Alcohol isnt over baring on the aroma but through the flavour it a bit strong. This beer leaves the warm feeling of scotch down the back of your throat. You have to wait some time between tastes to let everything settle down. This particular brew, was 7.4%ABV.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"
