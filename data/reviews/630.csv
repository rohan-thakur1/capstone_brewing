630,"2017-05-26",3.8,"500ml bottle. 2016 vintage. Appearance: Jet black, opaque, with a minimal khaki head. 
Aroma: Rich roasted coffee and mocha. Molasses and a slight hint of dark fruit 
Taste: Starts with a really rich malt sweetness and strong coffee roast that fades into dark chocolate and touch of toffee, only for the strong dark roast to kick back in on the swallow 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a touch of viscosity, and low carbonation. 
Finish: Roasted malt and coffee most prominent, with a bit of dark chocolate. Very malty, no real nuttiness apparent 
Overall: Really nice take on an imperial milk stout, with a dominant coffee roast and dark chocolate that isnt bitter or acrid. Balances well against the sweetness of the malt and lactose","","TH28"
630,"2017-05-20",4.0,"Ar: Espresso, with a chocolate and slight green pepper note; dry, toasty malt; some char. Ap: Black, opaque; medium tan head with moderate-low retention, leaves bits of trail on the glass sides here and there, and a creamy cap of bubble splotch. T: Milk chocolate and toffee; smooth, bittersweet coffee and cocoa just permeate; cream and vanilla notes; ashy coffee on the finish, with a bit of tiramisu; medium bitterness, a bit herbal in flavor; lingering espresso and cocoa powder on the finish. P: Medium-full body with medium-high carbonation; finish is medium-dry. O: Delicious! Big notes of coffee, cocoa, and toffee, backed up by a moderate sweetness, but nothing tasting artificial or cloying; the coffee and chocolate really stand out, but the maltiness and roast of the underlying beer never get lost.","Plainfield, Vermont, USA","Jabic"

Aroma of overly sweet bakers chocolate, milky sweetness, & mild lactose. Light coffee bean undertones give off a mocha-java vibe, but I was expecting the coffee presence to be a little heavier. Mild hint of roast. Flavor definitely has more coffee. Id say about a 50/50 split between coffee & chocolate in the flavor. Still would like a little heavier hand on dat coffee, though. Creamy coffee beans, milk chocolate, & a light twinge of roast somewhere in the back-end. Definitely sweet but not close to cloying or heavy. Sweet creaminess lasts into the finish. Tasty stuff, although much like the White Chocolate Moo-Hoo variant, I dont think its THAT much different (or better) than the original Moo-Hoo which is much cheaper & easier to acquire.

630,"2014-12-02",3.8,"22oz, black waxed bottle. Poured a dark brown, almost black color with an off white head. Roasty, coffee, chocolate, lactose, and vanilla. Big bold flavors for a 6% stout.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
630,"2014-11-30",4.5,"Pours a deep sable just a whisker above ebony with a thick, fine-bubbled, and fluffy tan head. Aroma has strong roast malt, smoky, chocolate, quality coffee, and nutty notes, along with earthy and molasses hints. Flavor is very mocha-like, coffee and chocolate with nutty and roast malt undertones, not quite as good as the aroma promised but still a very enjoyable brewski. Break, break my heart that this is one-time only - but on the other hand, I am glad that I managed to lasso a bottle. Texture is creamy, if not firm, and not overly fizzy; finish, though, has good chocolate, coffee, nutty, and roast malt notes. I look forward to more like this one.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Rough aroma, coffee, lots of coffee, a bit of an off medicinal aspect or something, hints of dark chocolate. Okay flavor, more chocolate coming through, milky, creamy, a touch of fruitiness.

630,"2014-11-23",3.7,"After striking out on previous terrapin limited releases I was able to score this one. Big fan of the regular moo hoo so was stoked for this with an espresso addition. Might be my taste buds but I barely noticed the espresso both in the nose and the flavor. Still good but really doesn't add a lot to the regular moo hoo, though glad I got a chance to try it.

Nice all around dark coffee chocolate beer. Seems like it has more alcohol than it does. Still balanced and good.","North Carolina, USA","HourGlass13"
630,"2014-11-19",4.7,"650 ml. Jet black and opaque with a thin creamy topping of foam. Big aroma of fresh espresso and quality dark chocolate. Tastes of the same with some touches of tart berry and cream. Medium body is silky smooth and makes a great dessert without ever becoming sticky-sweet. None too complex, just straightforward blasts of a few flavors. But the mighty fine ingredients executed in just the right proportions makes this a great one.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

630,"2014-11-10",4.1,"Bottle. Awww, man - no ratings when jbruner sent it to me, but three snuck in before I got a crack at it. Pours dark black with a medium creamy tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is heavy espresso, a bit of mocha chocolate, but really just coffee. Flavor is much more mocha balanced, roasty, chocolate, espresso, some ashtray. Light sweet and light bitter. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel. Definitely a monster for a 6.1% beer.
