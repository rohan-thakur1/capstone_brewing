2965,"2016-11-05",2.5,"Bottle thanks to beastiefan! Oh yeah. Classic cheap lager nose, modest adjunct, rice? Doesnt seem very corny. Light peppery and grassy German hop nose. Very clear, pale yellow. Minimal white head. Taste is sweet corn with a very light peppery note, spritzy mouthfeel, moderatelybsweet finish. A light green apple character in the very finish. Not bad.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
2965,"2016-05-30",2.9,"Been looking for this one for a year. OH MY. gold pour lots of foam. Aroma honey malt, some grassy hops. Tastes pils, honey, big grass, tangy deep flavor, but not enough carb and yeah this is harsh.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
2965,"2016-05-27",3.1,"Oh, yeah. Draft poured into a pimp cup then wrapped in gangsta rap and consumed in Bed-Sty. Well, not really but beat that Andrew. Heck, I love WA brewed malt likka. A little appley, a little corn sweet but damn good for the style. Of course, this is a baby malt likka at less 7abv. If I had to drink a malt likka it would be the Naked City version. If I had to drink a malt likka and drive, this would be my huckleberry.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2965,"2016-05-20",3.2,"Bomber via trade, thanks AK. Poured a thinner body of bright gold with a piss foam bright white head. Aroma/flavor of corn and rice, light alcohol, sort of harsh, green grapes and glue. Body is medium but with soft carbonation it comes off as watery. Pretty good for what this is though.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
2965,"2016-05-03",3.4,"Draft pour pint to a glass mug, then wrapped in a brown paper bag, per my request. Im all about proper pours and glassware. Or paperware if you must. Lighter pale golden color with not much head. Malt and soft sweet aroma. Flavor is sweet malt, bit somehow finds a way to be inoffensive. Technically, isnt all beer malt liquor? I still dont get it. Until then, for all beers that get labeled this way, this one tasted better than any that I can remember. I wonder of craft malt liquor will be a thing.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2965,"2015-05-08",3.2,"Clear golden with a white head. Noticeable corn and grain aroma. Similar taste with a heavy sweetness to it. Medium full body. Ligh bitter end that gets swarmed by more sweet notes. Solid malt.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
2965,"2011-01-06",2.7,"Bomber from Malt & Vine. Pours gold with a very transient fizzy white head. Sweet cooked sugar aroma. Med body. Flavor is fairly malty. Tastes like some sort of cooked sugar desert. Far from disgusting. No trace of fusil oils. But its totally lacking in bitter.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2965,"2010-02-25",1.0,"22 oz bottle.  Tasted as a part of an 18 beer Malt Liquor blind tasting.  Pours a clear pale gold body with minimal to no head.  Pretty offensive nose, mostly veggies with just a little malt and some light alcohol.  Tastes of corn and rice with cooked celery and light to moderate sweetness.  Sticky and clingy body with soft carbonation.  Pretty terrible.  I was expecting a lot more from this one, it was one of the two craft Malt Liquors in the tasting (with Rogue Dads Little Helper) and it sucked just as bad as the rest of them.  The Rogue beat the crap out of this one.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

2965,"2009-10-08",3.3,"22oz bomber courtesy of RiversideAK poured into a tulip.

Pours a clear yellow gold with a bubbly white head that recedes to a collar fairly quickly and leaves no lacing.

The aroma is sugary malts and some sweet corn.  There are also hints of toasted grains and maybe some hops if you really try to find them.

The taste has a little bit of hops up front but they are quickly swept away by the dominant corn and sweet malt backbone which last through the finish and leaves a sticky sweetness on the tongue with an alcohol burn as well.  There is a bit of a toasted grain bitterness that comes out a little as it warms.

The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with decent carbonation and sticky with sweet malts and corn on the palate.

Well, this is, without a doubt, the best malt liquor Ive ever tasted.  That doesnt put it in the pantheon of overall beers for me, but its pretty darn drinkable and I wouldnt mind having one of these every once in a while.  If only it came in a 40....","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
2965,"2009-10-06",2.8,"Bottle Lightly hazy, light golden lager with a small, creamy, white head. The aroma is pretty corny  smells a bit like CornNuts  with a touch of acetaldehyde. Medium-bodied with soft carbonation. Leans on the sweet side of balance. Grainy  corn mostly. Not really my thing, but grateful for the chance to try it.

2965,"2009-09-03",2.8,"Thanks to ucusty for sharing the ghetto brew. Crisp and clear golden pour, with modest carbonation. Nose is corn malt, some sweet bready notes, and a modest tang from some hops. Average mouthfeel, slightly too thin but benefits from prickly carb that makes the finish less thin than it might otherwise be. A bit too solvent-y in the flavor, but its got enough grass and grain to avoid the ""shitty"" ruling.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

2965,"2009-09-03",3.5,"Thanks to RiversideAk for the bottle.  I should have brown bagged it to get full appearance points.  Not the typical malt liquor.

2965,"2009-09-02",2.5,"Thanks Dave for sharing.  This is a malt liquor, all right.  Corn and some cardboard.  But some hops and decent sweet malt as well.  Not terrible by any stretch... but not so good, either.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"

2965,"2009-08-05",2.9,"Notes from Seattle International Beer Festival. Smells neutral, perhaps slightly metallic. Soft, malty, reminds me of a Belgian with none of the complexity. I like the idea of reviving the traditional malt liquor, though possibly only as a novelty.","Washington, USA","killjoy966"
2965,"2009-07-26",3.8,"Bomber wrapped up in a bag to keep it cool and for the full experience.  Nose is honey sweet, malty wheat and nice blast of corn.  First splash went out to my homies.  Taste is apple sweet with corn and hay.  I am no connoisseur of Malt Liquor by any means, but what I have had was a struggle to drink let alone finish.  This is solid and super drinkable.  I want this to be in the regular rotation for Siver City...this is a bad ass Malt Liquor!","Washington, USA","bvc"

Nothing too amazing in the taste either, just easy to drink with nothing harsh about it. Has a watery carbonated mouthfeel.

2965,"2008-09-24",3.8,"On tap @ Uber. Pours crystal clear gold with white head. The aroma is fresh and crisp with a note of floral hops followed by bolder notes of grainy malts and creamed corn. Very little sense of the ABV (where off putting fusels almost define the style). The taste is much the same with persistent floral hops throughout along with grainy malts and corn on the cob. It gets sweet with sugary malts at times. Best of the style I’ve had to date. Very nice brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2965,"2008-08-25",3.2,".3 liter draft pour at Uber Tavern in Seattle, Washington.  Pour is clear golden with a thin white head. Aroma of floral corn and sweet maltiness.  Also, a decent amount of alcohol on the nose.  Its more of a medicinal alcohol, but alcohol nonetheless. Taste is sharp sweet malt corn and the medicinal alcohol.  Palate was quite carbonated, and this one actually was well integrated despite the description I just gave.  Overall, a first class Malt Liquor.  Thanks Uber for putting this one on a bit early.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
2965,"2008-08-21",3.8,"Draft at Uber. This may well be the king of malt liquors right here. Pours a crystal clear bright gold with a thin, creamy-looking platinum blonde head. Lots of corn and a little sweet grassy hop on the nose. Plenty of visible steady rising carb. Nice creamy medium body with just a bit of carb to make it refreshing. Plenty of corn and even a little hint of toasted corn nuts on the mid-palate, along with some gently grassy hop. This actually makes malt liquor a refreshing and pleasant style.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
