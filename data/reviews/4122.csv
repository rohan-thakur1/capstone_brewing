4122,"2016-09-19",4.0,"Big, epic thnx to Jason for making it possible for me to try this ! Pours very dark brown. of course, no head. Smell is huge, sweet, but has a funky aspect, I guess by the raspberry sourness. Taste is very full, sweet, candy-sweetness ( caramelized fruit ) bit sour-ish ( almost) trough the fruityness that is very intense. thick, rich, caramel-coated raspberry","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
4122,"2016-08-30",4.9,"Big honey aroma, also great port character. If I hadnt had Endo right before this, it would have probably gotten a perfect score too","Oceanside, California, USA","Floydster"
4122,"2016-07-26",4.8,"Bottle at Superstition, pours a deep dark mahogany. Aroma brings out decadent raspberries, dry port barrel presence and light candied sugar. Flavour is sweet and treacly, with loads of raspberries upfront, followed by treacle, candied / brown sugar, and light port. Decadent as hell. If I had to choose a favourite between this and the Endo, itd be that, but by a narrow margin. Phenomenal stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4122,"2016-05-25",4.7,"Pours a deep purple red. Very bright and clear. Aromas of raspberry jam, light hints of wine tannins. Slight alcohol. Taste is sweet obviously. Doesnt have the sour finish that endovicus has. Just very jammy and complex. Amazing.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
4122,"2016-03-30",4.6,"Taster pour at the meadery. Dark red pour, maybe a tinge brown? Kind of dark here at the bar. Massive raspberry nose. Super sticky fruit with some caramel and toffee notes from the candi sugar. Wonderful.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"

4122,"2016-03-19",4.5,"RBWG16. Bottle pours with a deep amber red body that leaves behind a modest degree of legginess. The aroma offers up some honey with a bit of wax and then it unloads seductive levels of reduced sticky raspberry goodness. Goodness. Oh yeah. The taste explodes with soft flavor rich tooth enamel staining berry yum. The berry notes are just rich and deep and then pick up a modest level of berry tartness that is balanced out nicely with the rich sweet soft honey notes. This stuff just goes and goes and I just love the nectar rich berry, wow. I could just drink this all night, no problem.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4122,"2016-03-12",4.9,"A wonderful barrel aged mead from Superstition. None of the syrupy mouthfeel present in so many meads. I though it would be hard to top the white series, but this does just that. Amazing!","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","JJMBeer"
4122,"2016-02-28",3.9,"Bottle @ RBWG 2016. Thanks, Dak. Blood red colored pour. Really, really woody. A lot of fruit stems and skins. Pretty heavy berry character and a bit of pinot noir. Slight acidity and even a touch savory. Raspberry certainly dominates this one. Isnt super sweet and has some nice balance to it. Maybe a touch of citrus, too.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

4122,"2015-08-11",4.1,"Taster at the meadery. A sharp and very sweet nose of pungent tawny port, extremely earthy raspberry, funky damp oak, a healthy amount of alcohol, and a strange vegetal note similar to rhubarb with a minor herbal blend at the end. Clear deep copper pour. The taste is incredibly smooth and complex with layers of raspberry, slightly boozy port (which provides an immediate dryness), solid honey (but not too sweet), moderate boozy heat, and a brief mesquite flourish to close. The port creates a bone-dry finish to the point where its nearly gritty. A very well-crafted mead; the amazing balance between the flavors is what sets this one apart from Superstitions other top-notch offerings, but I think it might need a wee bit more time to reach its full potential.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
4122,"2015-08-08",4.9,"Appearance is almost tawny in color. Aroma of mesquite right off the bat followed by fresh raspberries. Flavor of sweet raspberry up front followed by oak and finishes with a wonderful port flavor. Finishes semi sweet with a slight dryness that makes you want to take another sip. An amazing complex mead, very thankful to get to try this.","Arizona, USA","SmoketreeBrewr"
