2476,"2016-02-19",4.4,"2009 Vintage finally opened on 2/19/2016, on the week of Double Visions annual release date by Grand Teton. Bottle conditioned, gold-foil labeled 1.0 Liter swing-top bottle. This is the brew chosen to celebrate my 1,000th tasting review on Ratebeer.com. ...and a terrific choice at that! Only wish I had some mates here to share it with. Oh well, all for me will have to work. Notes: mild pop upon opening stirs concern that this might be past its prime. A dimpled mug receives a silky smooth, cola brown pour with nil head. The nose and first taste... a surprise, a success. This is a great Doppelbock! All the aforementioned characteristics are still present seven years on. Bright, strong malty nose of caramel; hay and cereal galore as if there are lambs present; along with some mild spices. Its as if Im tasting this in the middle of a farm. The flavor is very malt-forward as well. Medium sweet and a little bitter roast. Burnt caramel attack that never ends. Full body, thick-sticky texture, mild carbonation and a long mildly roasted finish. Almost a pity I opened this without an audience. Dynamite Dopple!!","Portland, Oregon, USA","cmonster"

Nose is thick and very full of heavy malts... not sweet smelling.. just very malty.. sorta a plummy fruitiness... wow.. you dont get this much in doppelbocks (in a good way).. I would expect a long boil or decoction made this one as aromatic as it is.

Flavor is very complex for a doppelbock... a bunch of stuff going on here.. thick maltiness... some slight chocolate... is this what melanoidins taste like???? sorta a pruney frutiness with a bunch of malty sweeness.. but it still seems very drinkable despite the great body and slightly light carbonation.. the only thing that I can complain about is that it may be a tad sticky... but overall, I am damn impressed with this one... very very smooth.. and the complex malt characteristics come in waves as it warms up.. this may be the best example of an American dopplebock that Ive ever had.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"

2476,"2014-09-04",3.7,"""Not sure what to think of this beer. Suspending expectations, its definitely an enjoyable and decadent beer. If I was really in the mood for a doppelbock, though, this would be a huge miss. Everyones rating is pretty spot on, but for the fact that nobody mentions this is really nothing like any other doppelbock. Pours like a stout, and has very little of the liquid bread aspect the style usually is known for. Lots more choaolte and dark malt. Sweet, almost rum like in its fruitiness, with some yeast and roast coming through as well. So, very nice beer, not a good doppelbock.

This continues with these elements into raisin and chocolate.  It has some tartness in here, and is a little bit bitter.  The aftertaste is coffee and chocolate and is pretty strong.

12oz bottle, courtesy of Grand Teton. Thanks! Pours a deep, reddish-caramel color; fine-bubbled medium tan head with modest lacing. Nicely handled nose: caramel, dried dark fruits (dates, raisins), and toasty brown sugar throughout; a beautifully bready, caramel-driven aroma that keeps from cloying. Medium-full body; medium to medium-high carbonation (a touch high, and if anything the most obvious element pointing to American origins... besides the hop bill); certainly a mouthful, with a pleasant, lifting acidity. Theres definitely plenty of malt depth here - caramel, brown sugar, toffee... - along with an atypically assertive hop presence, hinting at citrus and floral depth, with a firm bitterness in any event; clean yeast character, and a flawless presentation overall: steely minerals, solid citrus bitterness, layered caramel and restrained maltiness; the hops and the carbonation give it away. Lasting finish of brown sugar and light cereal-grain toastiness; the slightest sweetness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Taste - the flavor on this beer matches nearly in perfect step with the wonderful aroma.  Heapings of brown sugar, vanilla, raisins, caramel...its definitely a malt monster and its fantastic.

More cocoa than Ive ever seen in this style on the nose, raisin, vanilla, quite malty with an earthy/woodsy character as well, toasted bread.  Again, the cocoa comes out significantly in the flavor.  Its robust with a roasty, almost smoky quality.  Toasty malt carries throughout.  Wow this is good, hard to put it down to take notes.  Molasses and black licorice creep in.  The finish has more rich cocoa, vanilla, caramel, woodsy.  A splash of booze is noticeable as well with a rich tobacco aftertaste.  Medium to full bodied with a velvety, chewy mouthfeel and a low level of carbonation.  Despite the abv, this is highly drinkable.  Smooth, rich, enormously complex, phenomenal.  By far the best doppelbock Ive ever had.  Well done Grand Teton.","Idaho, USA","TLNash886"

dark burgundy/garnet brown with an orange tinted khaki colored head. 

the aroma is intensely nutty... followed by chocolate, brown sugar, minerality similar to co2, rootbeer and a light sourness from fruity notes of prunes and dried things. it smells a lot like two turtle doves???.

the flavor is full of chocolate, malt and brown sugar with lesser notes of cola, birch, roasted nuts, molasses, raisins and a slight ashiness. there is a mild sourness/tartness on the finish which helps clean it up. it is a bit on the sweeter side of what i prefer but that certainly does not slow me down this time.
