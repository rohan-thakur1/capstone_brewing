Light bodied with low carbonation. The beer could use a bit more carbonation to enhance the feel and support the overall flavor. Overall, this was drinkable and enjoyable. Easy to get through a snifter of this. Could use some minor improvements and tweaks. Pretty good.

1531,"2012-09-06",3.7,"A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a three-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head; it subsides somewhat quickly, though stays around, and leaves lots of lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is a pale amber hue with gold highlights, but shows a brilliantly clear, bright, pale amber tinged, gold hue when held up to the light. The nose is expressively fruit with a ton of pear, hints of green tropical fruit, touches of kiwi, starfruit, honey-dew melon, and even some floral apple notes. The pear aromatics are the dominant note here, but this is backed by a dried grassy, threshed wheat, and pale wheat cracker like grain character. Hints of pepper, perhaps some pink ginger, and some lightly spicy phenolics help to add some complexity.

Dry, floral, pear flavors up front explode aromatically in the flavor. The beer is quite light bodied, extremely quaffable, and it is even a bit on the thin side. A bitter, grassy, slightly herbal, hop character adds some bite in the finish; in fact the bitterness is noticeable from beginning to end. Despite being dry, the floral and fruit notes combine to form a honey like flavor here. Mixed in with the hop character in the finish is a dried straw like, and even slight wheat cracker like grain flavor. Lots of tropical fruit character is found here; it is not the typical tropical fruit character from American hops, but instead is more like star-fruit, some kiwi, and some very floral, sort of guava leaning (but not really) fruit. The interesting thing about the fruit character is that there really isnt much in the way of citrus character here.

This has a really interesting hop signature to it; I never would have guessed Simcoe was used here, perhaps the dryness of the beer brings out the green-fruit notes from the hops. This beer is quite good in the end, I could wish for a touch more palate heft, as this seems even a bit light bodied for a Saison, much less a Wit inspired beer. Once it warms up significantly it picks up some fullness to it though. For me the totality of this beer adds up to more than the sum of its part.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Med + body - but not when the carb dissipates. Flavor is smooth light stone fruit, a bit of wheat, and a touch of citrus. I think this ale demonstrates that a wheat ale can be turned into a hop monster. One queries what this would have been had it been more barley than wheat. As time goes on, the aroma goes floral. The taste becomes simply hop. What a glorious endeavour. Makes me think of the Disney movie Ratatouille. Not everyone can make a great ale, but a great ale could be made by anyone.

How: From a bottle at Mondial de la Bière 2011

In long: Nose is a bit tart, wheaty and only lightly fruity.  It really smells like a typical wheat beer.  Taste is plain and simple, wheat, white bread, hay, lemongrass light notes of mint.  Finish offers a mild tartness and a mild bitterness.  Lively carbonation.  Not a bad beer at all but to me this was quite a disappointment after their stellar IV and V.  Im really starting to believe that Jandrain-Jandrenouille is modeling their beer line-ups after the Star Wars episodes.  First there was episode IV and episode V and they were great.

1531,"2011-08-30",3.6,"My Bottom Line :  
Crunchy wheat and citrus fruit ride this polished brews prickly, sustained effervescence, leading to a levelled herbal bitterness. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam tops the misty straw golden. 
-The expansive carbonation is relentless; even breathing does not seem to soften it.
-The yeast character is very clean and timid. There is not much rurality in this brew.
-Light bread notes tag along.
-There are orange-y hints which must come from the hops.
-This is very drinkable and very well made, yet it is not as compelling as their IV Saison, imho.

1531,"2011-07-08",3.5,"Hazy gold topped by a vigorous tight-bubbled white foam. Aromatic both from forward citrusy hops and characterful rustic yeast. Generously estery, it makes a rather complex fruit salad when pairing fruity hops with saisonish yeast. In mouth, the bready, grainy cereal profile takes more room than Id thought. Even though it feels fresh enough and relatively light-bodied, it lacks perhaps a bit in acidity to be the outstanding refreshment it could have been. A slight huskiness is present, enhancing these attributes. Warming up, it seems to grow a candle wax side, more perfumey and powdery/floury that deters a bit from the enjoyment, so I recommend a cool serving temperature. The carbonation also feels a bit agressive, not being the foamy expansive typical Belgian bubbliness, but a constant small bubbles bite.

Dorée présentant une légère brume, mousse épaisse blanche.
Arôme rappelant le houblon citra avec pas mal de bonnes notes citronnées agrémentée de quelques épices tout en conservant cet côté blé/levure belge.
En bouche, on en retire une blanche unique sans ce qui fait généralement ce style, le tout est remplacé  par les saveurs des houblons qui viennent égailler cette bière en lui donnant des notes de fruits, pin, fleur de houblon et damertume légère. Sur la fin, je note aussi un petit côté biscuité du malt.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Aroma of light citrus and bitter hops with wheat malt and fruity ester is somewhat unique and interesting. Taste was a weird mix between some lightly citrus notes with some light bubblegum wheat malt and some US hops also thrown in the mix. Body was average with good carbonation. Weird mix and not something I would seek on a regular basis but interesting nonetheless.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

1531,"2010-09-06",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2011 750ml bottle from IPB.

Appearance : Clear pale yellow medium foamy head. Light lacing.

Aroma : Great wheat with fruits and light funk. Citrusy. Light notes of paint remover that fades away with time. Quite yeasty with dusty notes.

Taste :  Malt with bitter hops. Wheat and dusty yeast. Finish bitter with wheat. Hops are rather earthy and a bit floral. Nice wheat on finish, light fruits. Quite dry.

Palate : Very fizzy at first, a bit harsh. Much smoother after a few swirls.

Overall : Far from being as good as I remember the tap was. Very refreshing and summer-y but not as elegant as the IV and V. The light paint remover aroma bug me quite a bit too. A bit disappointing compared to the tap but still interesting.

On tap at Moeder Lambic Fontainas.
Appearance : Hazy yellow with a medium creamy white head. Nice lacing.

Aroma : Very fruity. Notes of mangos and passion fruits. A little bit of funk with a very enjoyable light tartness. Slightly barnyard on nose.

Taste : Nice fruity passion fruits with wheat and malt. Finish is a bit salty. Light tart and funk.

Overall : Carbonation was a bit soft especially near the end of the glass. Awesome nose. Very interesting taste. Nose is very complex. If the carbonation was a bit more lively this would have been almost perfect. 100609 9,4,8,2,17; 4.0","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Massive fruity aroma, hints at citrus, lychee, peach, melange of citrus and tropical fruits is glorious. 9+ Flavour is pleasant but suffers greatly from the high expectations set by the aroma. Mild flavour is on the sweet side, light wheaty character, mild whispers of the citrus and fruit shown off in the aroma, very light bitterness, mild fruity undercurrent throughout. 7+ Smooth a average plus palate has an interesting smoothness to it.

Aroma holds unbelievable peach and nectarine, along with more subtle hints of dough, coriander, and grassy hop. The flavor is pretty close to perfect for this style of beer; fruitiness fades a touch to reveal amazing yeast, hops, bread, and spice components. Mouthfeel is masterfully drinkable yet full-bodied.

Dry, less citrussy in the mouth, but still extremely hoppy. Dry vegetable taste (courgette?). Bit vinous, even. Light body, spritzy carbonation, very little slickness but the wheat is there.
