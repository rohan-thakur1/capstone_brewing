3286,"2015-12-21",3.8,"Pour on tap at the brewery, hazy golden pour with white head, aroma brought notes of biscuit, bread, nice spice, grassy, and floral notes, hints of slight vanilla. Taste was a mix of grass, earth, spice into a bit of yeast, bread, some floral notes with a touch of grain, finishing slightly bitter. Very drinkable, yet very tasty.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
3286,"2015-12-03",4.3,"On tap at the brewery. Clear, amber appearance with a small amount of foam. Hop taste is present but not overwhelming. Complex taste and pleasant aroma. Really solid beer. Easy to drink-- could drink all day easily.","","Sonjeroo"
3286,"2015-11-02",4.2,"(growler) Pours a clear gold color with a medium and fluffy white head. Aroma instantly transports me to lager world with the requisite must and cut grass accompanied by some canned mandarin orange. Not too much here, but its nice. Could be a smidge of bartlett pear.  Sweet corn shows up when warmer. The flavor is where this beer really shines, with a near-perfect ascension from dough to crackery malt, up to citric (orange again) and then spicy/grassy hop, and on towards gravel in the finish. The beer really snaps on the finish and cleans up nicely which merits a 5 for palate. Overall this is one of the best lagers Ive had in quite awhile.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
3286,"2015-11-01",3.6,"Majority of 8 oz. pour, on tap at the brewerys taproom in Nordeast Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 10-31-15. Pours a slightly hazy but mostly clear gold with a small to moderate amount of off-white to eggshell head. Not as cloudy as expected. Floral, subtle aroma. Quite pleasant but too subtle smell to be ideal. Very nice, Noble-esque European hops in the flavor. Dry, chalky, floral taste features flavors of Champagne and rocks. Greater complexity emerges upon multiple sips. Dry finish. Nice, long, dry aftertaste. Lively and frothy in the palate. Not as crisp as a lager ideally should be. The 4 I am giving for the palate is based mostly on the aftertaste. Overall good and enjoyable but not spectacular. Very likable; I like it more and more on each sip. Too subtle to be great but too drinkable to be merely mediocre. My rating rose from a 3.4 (7/3/7/3/14) to a 3.6 (7/3/7/4/15) as I drank it, and, if I had consumed a full pint, it may have risen a tenth or two tenths of a point higher still maybe but I prefer small pours to maximize variety, and most beers produce quickly diminishing returns after the first few ounces. Well executed and a well above average lager.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3286,"2015-10-30",3.9,"Slightly hazy yellow pour with a nice white head and slight white lacing on tap at FSBC. Bright nose with a hint of malt and a hint of spice. Super clean palate, a touch of biscuit malt moves into old school earthy and spicy hops. Dry finish, bitterness lingers. Quite nice.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
3286,"2015-10-29",4.3,"Keg @ Fair State. Slightly hazy light gold with a modest white head. Nose is wonderfully expressive. Straw and dewy pastureland. Light Apple and baked bread. Soft earthy bitterness. Just a touch of peppery hop.toasty grain. Light honey. So delicate. Light and easy to drink. Mellow carbonation. A total masterpiece. Wow, this is amazing.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
3286,"2015-10-22",4.2,"Almost fully hazed, beautiful pure gold color. Wet hay, sweet corn and farm air aroma, with fresh grass, lemon essence, browned banana. These unfamiliar hops seem fairly assertive and detailing them is difficult. White bread malts and a pinch of dried tomato acidity. Fresh and buoyant flavor with delicate herbal notes of lavender leaning against phyllo malts and crisp grassy bitterness. In both the aroma and flavor, there is fleeting, elusive juiciness, white peach and tangerine. The mild funkiness of freshly mulched wood is a pervasive, sophisticated balancing element here. Palate is crisp. Airy and pillowy, though deceptively dense. Theres so much of everything I want in this style, almost to a point of excess; yet, the careful balance of hop presence, suggestive but not overwhelming funk, and lean, supportive malt structure is simply an immaculate success.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3286,"2015-10-10",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2016 At Fair State. Hazy, gold color. Lager yeast and hop aroma. Spicy, citrus hops with lemon. The hop flavor is very prominent, but is followed by malt. Dry on the palate. Very drinkable. Excellent keller.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3286,"2015-10-10",3.8,"Tap at the taproom. Hazy golden pour with a white head. Sweet grains, great body, hint of hop bite. Excellent.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
3286,"2015-10-10",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2015 On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazy bright gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has crisp grain and straw with a touch of grass underlying. Flavor has a real nice grain and grass combination with a bit of bread supporting and a slight dry bite.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
