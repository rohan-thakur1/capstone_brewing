2959,"2016-12-10",3.0,"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with barely any head and lots of bubbles coming to the surface. Much like a cider would pour. The aroma shows notes of tart apples, honey, sweet malts, and a touch of grains. Flavor follows with the apple skins and honey up front followed by some burnt malts, some grainy yeast, and booze. Medium bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a boozy, malty and apple finish. This one was kind of all over the place. Didnt care for this one much.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
2959,"2015-06-23",2.3,"Bottle at Pauls for the FF 2015 tasting. Pours a light body. Mouthfeel is thin with notes notes of dry apple, booze, sharp yeasty character, some spice, and boozy honey flavor. I wasnt a big fan of this one.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"

2959,"2015-03-19",3.3,"Bottle at Pauls for Andy and Maxs Fantasy Football winnings tasting. Pours a hazed gold with a thin white head than vanishes immediately. Apple flesh on the nose, sweet acid. Tart apple, grainy and malty. Slow apple must on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

2959,"2014-01-26",3.4,"12oz bottle courtesy of shrubber85. Thanks again Roger. It pours with a totally opaque deep murky gold body that supports a light tan head. The aroma offers up apple skins and then a mix of thick apple sauce and pear juice. Hmm. Not too hateful for a malt liquor. The taste is nice and pretty rich with apple wedges, some pear esters and then a dry slightly boozy note. This is pretty nice and as such takes it a bit out of style for a malt liquor.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2959,"2014-01-18",2.7,"Gold pour, white head. Malty apples. Not overly sweet. Not overly offensive. Not overly great either.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2959,"2013-11-30",3.8,"Bottle. Honey and apple cider aroma. Murky yellow-brown with small head. Mildly sweet apple cider flavor with just a hint of alcohol. A malt liquor I would drink again even while sober.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"

Super cloudy yellow with a short off-white head.
Lemony-apple aroma.
Tart-sweet green apple and honey flavor.
Tasty...smooth, with a nice tingly acidity.
Very good....particularly for something in the Malt Liquor Category.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2959,"2013-04-03",3.9,"Malt likka from StFun. Thanks homie! Pours a cloudy dark yellow with minimal head. Looks a lot like apple cider. Aroma of apples and honey. Taste is sweet and sour. Medium bodied with a somewhat thin texture.  Soft carbonation and a decently long finish.  Overall, great. Apple cider and honey malt likka...i need moar!","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"
2959,"2013-03-13",3.4,"Hell yeah: single 12 FL. OZ. bottle from StFun -- many thanks! Pours a hazy nectarine with a trim, snowy white head. Aromas of applesauce...apple cider vinegar... sawdust? Tequila dregs, for sure. Maybe a little pineapple and honey; vitamins, too. Honestly, a hell of a lot better than I was thinking. It started off slightly tart and sweet, with notes of mashed apples, beeswax, blue agave, pickled pears, yeast and an almost immediate growing alcohol warmth. How much for a 6pack?","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
2959,"2013-03-07",3.9,"A local legend. Smells like heaven, and is like drinking a dream. Sex in a  bottle. Well actually malt liquor in a bottle...but malt liquor with honey and apples. Kinda like mixing up some Apple Cinnamon and Honey But Cheerios and pouring malt liquor all over it. Yeah, baby!","Indiana, USA","StFun"
2959,"2013-03-05",2.9,"fucken a, exploded out of the bottle a bit. Oh well. Pour very cloudy amber with just a bit of white head. Aroma and flavor are strong on the apple juice side, definitely some grape drink and malt going on in this one. Couldnt get much honey really, but it was on the sweeter side. Clean finish, not bad.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
2959,"2012-09-20",2.6,"Bottle from St. Fun.  Thanks!  Pours like muddy ditch water with a nose of trashed apple soaked in booze.  Flavor is garbage-aged apple wine with a light rertarded caramel finish.  Watery mouthfeel.  This beer was a blast to drink; Id drink more.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
2959,"2012-07-21",3.0,"On tap pours hazy honey yellow in color. Definitely a cider not a beer. Too much more tart than sweet. Very dry with a descent amount of carbonation.","Indiana, USA","hoffrobert"

2959,"2012-01-25",3.4,"Date: January 25, 2012 Mode: Bottle Source: misterbeer Description: Opaque yellow pour with minimal head.  Aroma is sour apple cider and sweet honey.  Tastes like warm apple pie, ummm....not really warm but rather a tart apple pie with a dry finish.  Not sure this belongs in the malt liquor style, but once this hits 10 ratings it may become the top in its style hahaha.  Thanks David!","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
2959,"2012-01-06",3.1,"Bottle Cloudy peach-colored ale with a small, creamy, white head. Theres not an awful lot going on with the nose, but its not at all offensive. Hints of fruitcake, tropical fruit medley and a whisper of toffee are the only nuances I am painstakingly able to pull from the glass. Light to medium-bodied with lively carbonation. The flavor is tangy and lightly tart, but mostly nondescript. At least its well-balanced, so theres that going for it. Finishes mildly tart, dry and quite refreshing. Not exciting, but very drinkable. Thanks go out to StFun for providing the bottle!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2959,"2011-11-01",3.6,"Malt liquor...Bottle from stfun. Murkey orange color, no head... Looks like apple cider. Nose is some apple, hay and honey. Taste is a lot better than expected. Apple, honey, hay, well balance and not sweet at all. Tasty... Medium to full body. Easy to drink. Overall. Pretty unique, thanks josh","Newark, Delaware, USA","GMCC2181"
2959,"2011-10-30",3.8,"Bottle thanks to StFun!  Hazy apple cider colored pour, very little carbonation and an aroma of...more apple cider.  Flavor is slight alcoholic fresh apple mash, a little sweetness from the honey and finished with an aftertaste similar to eating an apple (fresh fruit, slightly tart and all apple.)  A nice surprise, now if only all malt liquor was this good!","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
