Good herbal and lemony hoppy taste, soft, mild malty body, well balanced. Grapefruit pops up later on, quite distinctly. Bit dry, woody in the finish, bitterish.

WHAT A SURPRISE! Ive seen often big slogans like this one ""is it too hoppy, are you too soft"" and the hybrid of pilsner/ESB tended to have just a bitter beer. But its awsome hoppy - the taste and aroma way hoppy! Starts with maracuja and some sweet caramelized lemon and ends with a just as it needs bitterness, like a pilsner. The mouthfeel is awsome, it lacks a bit in the end but you got a pleasent aftertaste. Nice white head. Very drinkable and enjoyable.

Smells of cakey malts and unripe fruits among a pleasant leaf dankness. 

Has an overly high carbonation with a bubbly finish, toning down sweet malts, as well as hops, while establishing a metallic presence. 

Tastes of straw, ripe orange, toffee malts and a coppery harshness. There is a lime crispness underneath, enriching the hops, getting overpowered by toffee malts in the finish. Finishes clean, while producing a metallic flavor which numbs the palate to hops and malts.

Somewhere in between of an overly sweet lager or underhopped pale ale, loosing its focus entirely by producing a harsh, tongue numbing metallic aspect.","GERMANY","aleigator"
