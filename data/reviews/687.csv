687,"2015-01-24",2.2,"The aroma, this may sound silly, smells like when you walk into Founders Brewing, a bright red robust roast malt with a hint of sweet prune, and some bitter oak on the end.

Hidden underneath is a solid helping of toasty toffee, mild nuts, & a hint of peppery phenol, likely from the yeast. Taste hits with sweet malt & brash yeast up front; toffee, licorice, plums, lightly vinous grape skins, faint molasses... Finish is more yeast heavy with white pepper, spicy & fruit esters, & mild phenol. Lots of sticky toffee & a hint of nuttiness in the finish. Reminds me of a Scotch ale that uses Belgian yeast.

Sweet caramel, some booze, toffee. Taste is more of the same with big notes of caramel and toffee, but theres also some dark fruit character here as well. As it develops in the glass, it really mellows out and gets that raisin and fig characteristic that I love from old English Barleywines like Thomas Hardys.

687,"2013-02-27",3.5,"12oz bottle, 2012 vintage, thanks to umich03jm. Bottle is labeled as 11% alcohol, and has no mention of bourbon barrel aging, but the label says right on front ""A Few Shillings Too Many Ale"" and there is no other beer by that name in the database right now. Dark red / brown color. Hazy with the many particles suspended in the body. Minimal khaki / tan head, fades quickly to very little. Bigger body. Lighter carbonation. More dry overall, nothing sticky. At first sip, its impressive how well the alcohol is hidden in this. Does not taste like 11% at all. No more bite, burn, or warmth than youd find in an 8-9% scotch ale. More dry, I guess. Light bitter taste, some sweet. Caramel malt. Kind of peaty. Some light bourbon barrel in the flavor, actually. Some light fruity, herbal hop. Pretty awesome, interesting stuff.

687,"2009-08-03",3.0,"Big thanks to Derek for another Kuhnhenn brew, poured into a tulip.

Pours very, very dark, almost black in the glass.  It shows a deep, hazy copper when held up to the light.  there is a small off-white head that quickly recedes to a solid ring and a soapy swirl on top.  Not much lacing but some boozy legs on the sides.

The aroma is very sweet with the requisite caramel malts and some vanilla, but there is also a healthy dose of dark fruits in the nose and some hints of smoked peat.  The faintest tart cherry whiffs start to come out, but its very faint.  Theres a little alcohol burn in the nose as it warms.

The tart cherries show up early in the taste with an initial pop on the tongue that seems a little out of place.  The sweet dark caramel malt base is definitely still in there as well as some dark fruits, especially raisins and figs.  The finish has a slight smoked peat character but also some lingering sourness.

The mouthfeel is slick and typical of the last couple Kuhnhenn bottles Ive had.  Its not nearly as infected as the Rauch, but its definitely headed that direction.  Im glad I read some of the comments about these beers and caught this one before it really turned.  As it is, its a decent scotch ale that was probably an excellent beer when it was released.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

687,"2009-06-30",3.6,"12 oz. bottle from Winter Solstice Dec 2008.  Pours a hay deep copper color with a small fine beige head.  The aroma had a slight sour cherry note that hit just before the caramel malt, toffee, and slight tobacco.  I didnt get the sour cherry when I had this on tap prior to the Solstice party so Im thinking it is slightly infected.  The flavor does not show the sourness as much.  Very slight sour cherry, but dominated by chewy caramel malts, other dark fruits, slight tobacco, and a touch of alcohol as it warms.  Mouthfeel is smooth, but viscous.  This is another beer from Kuhnhenn that has two identities: on tap it is first class and in the bottle you had to drink it early or risk getting something that is infected.  My rating will reflect the combined score from both.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

Murky brown with a 1/2 finger beige head that faded to a thick ring and thin rather quickly, despite a vigorous pour.  Why does this smell sour?  Another infected Kuhnhenn beer from the Solstice release?  Youre kidding!  Sour cherries and light vinegar are up front in the aroma, with a fair amount of sweet caramel and rancid malts behind.  No bourbon, but I do get a little salty tobacco.  As this warmed up, the sourness did become a little more restrained.  And in the flavor, more restrained yet.  There were some cherries, though more of the fruit sense and not really tangy.  Still plenty of caramel malts, not really too rancid anymore, and the aforementioned salty tobacco.  Light generic chocolate notes are present.  The finish has bitterness around a 2 with not too much of an alcohol burn.  Minimal carbonation with a big thick body.

Thought is was much more complex than Alesmiths Wee Heavy. I am glad I had the oppertunity to try this brew.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"

687,"2008-10-09",4.5,"Beautiful reddish mahogany, cloudy topped by a large beige head, uniform and lasting (this is 12.5% mind you!). Upon smelling, you immediately enter the major leagues, there is not so much competition in the scotch ales department, even in a world-wide sense, but this one is an easy chart topper. It may actually be my favourite out of the dozens I’ve tried. Its strong cerealic nose immediately unveils layers upon layers of decadent maltiness. Every whiff opens a new domain of blossoming fruit, while a strong vanilla, peaty, earthy component actually has a real scotch feeling to it. Alcohol warmth is obvious, but you would not advance such a monstrosity as 12+%. The round and fruity body is thick, chewy (not syrupy), rich and an immediate charmer thanks to its cleansing, effective carbonation that leaves you reaching for another sip within an absolutely unreasonable delay. An example with everything, vinous, peaty, fruity, strong and one that keeps you addicted. Just writing the review makes me wish I had one in my hands. Superior scotch ale.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

687,"2008-06-28",4.0,"Best Before 2009 (coming in right below the wire)

A- Pours a murky brownish hue with a very small, tan head.

S- Smells deeply sweet, brown sugar, vinous notes, dark fruit, dates, raisin.

T- Taste is much lighter and sweeter than the nose. Lots of vinous, red wine notes come out, plum, quite a bit of unfermented sugary sweetness towards the end.

M- Has the mouthfeel of a Cabernet at this point. Fairly thick, almost no carbonation. Seems to work well with the flavor.

D- From the nose I was expecting an entirely different beast altogether but this one really suprised me. It has definitely aged well. I would have been interested to see what it tasted like a year and a half ago with more carbonation but the creamy mouthfeel seems to work for this one.","California, USA","Lothore"

Loads of dried dark fruits (raisins, dates), caramel, and sweet viscous maltiness in the aroma without being cloying.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: loads of sweet caramel, soft brown sugar, and honeyed, dried dark fruits; incredibly dense, generous, and satisfying; nicely earthy hoppiness at the perimeter; very well-composed beer; glad I got to rerate this!

Full mouthfeel: intense, chewy dried red fruits (cherries, raspberries), viscous candy; again, fruit rollups and fruit leather; even with the initial tartness, this is still reasonably pleasant; wish I tried it a year ago.

687,"2008-05-09",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2009 2008. 12oz Bottle. Aroma casts a soft, fireside glow of sherry, light port, and warmed walnut confit. Slightly alcoholic and backed with an aged malt tang. Pours a clear henna-tinted ruby, with little carbonation or head. Flavor is surprisingly bland. The beginnings of vinegar start. A very tangy, alcohol and malt come together at cracker and stilton rind to ride an old horse beyond town limits. Wet. This beer elicts falling rain. This is okay, but its no world-class Scotch Ale. Its got a soppy, old character to it that would be okay if there was heat, depth or expression. But, instead theres just a tired cellar-damp unenthusiasm in this beer. Not as sweet as Id expected. It does finish in a nice brown fruit, fig and toasted grain character. Certainly better than the very old bottle Id previously had, but I can certainly see how this beer can go over the hill fast. Drink this one if youve got it.

Were it not for the alcohol butting in, this could be a magnificent high gravity daily drinker, taste wise. Notes of chocolate pudding, booming smokiness, burnt toast, and a pounding caramel malt component drive the flavor forward. Finish is all caramel. The palate is pretty smooth but seems unorganized.

687,"2004-10-15",3.9,"draft at the brewpub--deep burgundy.  smells sweet, and of fruits, most particularly raspberry.  very sweet and sticky, malty.  lingering bitterness in the finish.  very interesting beer, and i never would have guessed that it was hiding a brisk 12.5% alcohol.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
687,"2004-10-09",3.8,"Draft: Cloudy brick. Tight-bubbled light beige foam. Rooty, liquefied fig aroma with caramelized banana, spicy alcohol, vanilla, and earthy malts. Very vinous and leafy with faint toast. Thick, slippery body. Mostly still. Truckload of meaty malts curb the initial leafy twang. Acidity muffles the sweetness with a blast of steeped overripe plums. Slightly medicinal, as well, with a surprisingly tame bourbon character. Sharp tannins continually underlie the soured fruit acidity. Lengthy plummy malt finish touched with vanilla and black cherry subtleties. Overall, less acidity and more velvety carbonation would deaden some of the acidity and better enhance the lushness of the malts. Great stuff, though.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

687,"2004-10-01",4.4,"Hooo boy.  I tried this one on my first visit to Kuhnhenns, during an extended lunch break from work.  It looks beautiful: A deep, dark red-black color with a small head.  That head was probably being chased away by the rich caramel and scotch aromas that were coming up from below.  Its sweet and hot, the scotch taking command of the affair.  You dont drink this beer, it drinks you.  I could never drink more than one of these per visit to Kuhnhenns but I will be sure to get one every time.","Michigan, USA","Dextolen"
687,"2004-09-12",3.9,"I dont consider myself to be a conoisseur of Scotch ales-not by any means. But I wish I wouldve had a better opportunity to taste the qualities of what makes a Scotch ale so wonderful with this beer. There was a LOT of bourbon that crowded out most of the toasted malty character. It was quality bourbon though, I could distinguish the tangy and sugary notes that deepened the ale, adding body (and alcohol) while not making it over the top.Maple syrup notes and a lingering bitterness. Enjoyable malty finish. I wish I could taste this non-bourbon aged.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
687,"2004-09-07",4.1,"On tap at the brewery.  Dark brown in color with almost no head, but it was white while it was there.  A sweet carmely soy sauce smell.  A winey/vanilla/cherry taste.  Lots of other flavors that I could not make out.  Reminded me a lot of a finely aged Sam Adams Triple Bock.","Rowlett, Texas, USA","flemdawg"
687,"2004-08-28",4.2,"On tap.  Wow.  This is a terrific brew.  Deep black.  Thick appearing  Large off white to tan head lingers.  This stuff is viscous!  Aroma is malty, the notes from the bourbon subtly make an appearance.  Perhaps some smokey notes.  Taste is very complex.  That means I cant make alot out of it.  Definately malty, some peat, bourbon notes.  Hops seem to be understated but present. Very good beer.","Alabama, USA","11026"
687,"2004-08-21",4.1,"from the tap at the brewery. poured dark brown with a tan head. aroma malts, licorice a hint of vinergar, alcohol. flavor this was a kick in the rear with the alcohol got caramel, honey, choc. at 1st I wasnt impressed the alcohol was to strong but as the beer warmed it just got better. another good one","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","walleye"
687,"2004-08-15",3.7,"2004 Great Taste of the Midwest. Dark red/orange body, tan head. A sweet malty licorice aroma with a big vinous licorice taste. Hints of bourbon and oak. Qutie a big beer, a bit overwelming at times.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
687,"2004-04-16",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2004 2004 draft.  Oh boy.  Starts out with a deep blackish-brown color, almost purplish.  Small off white head.  Aroma is sweet, brown sugar, rich caramel malt, light hints of bourbon, a bit of alcohol detectable and plenty of raisins and dark chocolate.  Flavor begins with a huge powerful body that sticks to the palate and is quite creamy.  The bourbon barrel aging adds a bittersweet element in the background that is subtle yet detectable enough to taste quite pleasant.  Lots of vanilla flavors, caramel and what hit me as a coconut flavor, weird but thats what I thought I tasted.  Warming on the finish, but never would I think this is 12.5.  Smooth and creamy, but perhaps a bit of a soy sauce (acidity from the barrel, combined with huge caramel malt dominance).  The mouthfeel, as far as its velvety, rich texture is concerned, deserves a 5, but the balance is way off.  Its sour, then sweet, then alcoholic.  Its not terribly cohesive.  A bit fatiguing at the end of the glass.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
