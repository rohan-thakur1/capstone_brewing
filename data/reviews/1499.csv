Ive never had an Evil Twin Brewing beer. They always seem to be a bit pricy for what Im looking for. However, I got $50 for my birthday and decided to give it a whirl. Picked Lil B over Christmas Eve at a New York Hotel Room and Soft DK. Heres to making the right choice.

Poured a black color with two fingers of dark tan, frothy head, which settled nicely on the top. Good amount of uneven, wet, foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Very good retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled some weird flavors off the get go, getting dark fruits - red apple, plum and purple grape - butterscotch, caramel, toffee, figs, dates, brown sugar and boozy molasses. Something a tad off. (Smell - 3.50)

Tasted better than the nose. Got smooth butterscotch, sugary caramel and toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, licorice, molasses, leathery notes and dark red apple. So smooth. (Taste - 3.75)

Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Overall I was disappointed in this one, although it did grow on me as it went down. I wonder how this would do with age. (Overall - 3.75)

1499,"2015-11-06",3.7,"355 ml bottle bought at Little Beer Shop in SoHo, Central.
Looks: Very deep Cola-blackish brown colour; Less than one-quarter finger head and residual soapy dark beige foam which fades in 15 seconds. Good sticky lacing and zero carbonation.

Aroma: Quite fragrant and sweet dark malt, with strong rum-like alcohol, strong raisins, plums, sugar, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, cream, light coffee, light lemon and faint grass.

Taste: Pleasant, very strong sweet dark malt, with fairly strong roastyness, very strong rum-like alcohol, burnt toast, strong caramel, sugar syrup, dark chocolates, black coffee, strong plums, dark fruits, assorted berries, dark cherries, liquorices, yeast, lime, moderate bitter hops and grass. 

Body: Close to full body. Thick and oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Wholesome maltyness in a very thickish background. Nicely roasted with initial burnt toasts. Syrupy booze with moderate liqiorices, thick but not cloying, like a liquor. Followed by strong caramel, dark chocolates, strong dark fruits and berries, especially raspberry and dark cherries. Ended with yeast and limey hops. Layered and intense. Nice!

Hoppiness: light lemon and faint grass in nose. Strong lime and grass in taste. Bitterness is moderate, barely matched with strong booze for a lasting, syrupy sweet bitter finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry. Very Sweet and boozy to mouth.

Comments: This is a very nice and headstrong Imperial Porter, with intense aroma and favour in fruity berries, rum booze, caramel and chocolates. Layered, warm and rather straight forward, a very neat sipper by all means, Ill like it even more if its a little slimmer. : )","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Theres a dryness to the first swallow that seems to only be there to make ready your taste buds for the ensuing flavor that sweeps in like a tidal wave and coats the entire inside of your mouth with a sweet sticky brew.
Leather and tobacco are prominent in the flavor, with black plums chiming in on the back end. As the beer warms and the head fades, I run the liquid around the sides of the snifter and create another island of foam; chocolaty and warm with swirls reminiscent of the skills of an excellent barista.
The high abv is obvious, but the excellent match of flavor to aroma to palate is keeping this particular beverage extremely drinkable. An ashy finish, long and creamy is going to be with me for more than a short while after the brew, but the after taste is very nice.

 Poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance  Pours a super thick looking massively dark brown brew that boarders on black. Upon pouring there is only the trace of brown colored foam sitting atop the brew. The foam fades almost instantly leaving little to no lace on the glass. Upon swirling the thickness of the brew can be seen with sticky fingers clinging to the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is sweet, roasted, and malty. There is a strong brown bread smell mixed with lots of caramel and molasses. Mixed with these aromas is a big chocolate smell that has notes of vanilla and a little bit of dark fruit, overall adding to the sweeter and roasted aromas of the brew. A warming alcohol smell accompanies the darker, roasted, and sweeter smells of the brew creating a sweet roasted cocoa aroma overall.

 Taste  The taste begins with a roasted malt flavor mixed with some flavors of caramel and molasses. A moderately strong and somewhat sweeter chocolate flavor is present upfront as well. A little bit of vanilla soon comes to the tongue adding to the chocolate sweetness. Toward the middle of the taste some of the caramel fades with the chocolate taking on a more dry cocoa like flavor. A big dose of coffee also comes to the tongue more toward the end of the taste intensifying the roasted and darker flavors of the brew. With some oaky booziness also coming to the tongue mixing with the other flavors at the end of the taste a warming dark roasted flavor is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and more viscous side with only a small amount of carbonation. The thickness and lower carbonation are fantastic for the roasted, coffee, cocoa and boozy flavors of the brew and make for a nice slow sipper.

 Overall A rather nice brew overall. It has a sweeter roasted aroma with the taste matching up in the front, but more toward the end it dries out rather nicely creating a nicely roasted flavor to linger on the tongue. A rather nice slow sipper.","","Darkmagus82"
1499,"2014-09-19",3.4,"Inky black pour. Peanut butter, date syrup, mocha rich nose. Heavy swirls send out bright red fruit lasers. High fruit sugar flavor with pomegranate, date, and green banana. Dripping in milk chocolate. Low patent black flavor is overwhelmed by gently layered, softer malts. Shades of hops are present but hard to distinguish from the saturated tangy fruit flavors. Big and bright throughout; oily palate can get a little washy and a lack of tannic balance for these flavors is unfortunate. There is good composure to this, but the powerful sweetness is ultimately too much for me.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1499,"2014-02-28",3.0,"Very dark brown with a large tan head that never quite goes away. Lots of lacing, appears to be very well crafted. The aroma reveals graham crackers, leather, earthiness, and alcohol. Very strange description, but this is a very complex-scented brew. I could get a different scent note from every whiff. Taste was a little weak. Surprisingly watery up front, roasty and tons of booze in an aftertaste that goes away very quickly. Thin on the palate, easy drinking for how strong it is, but I would like more complexity. Evil Twin can do better; this was not one of my favorite ET selections.","Missouri, USA","coachd"

Its relatively sweet but this is appropriately met by quite a firm roasty bitterness. The palate is syrupy with the carbonation a touch below average.

An head of homebrew consistency forms and falls. Loose, mucky deep brown suds last little more than the time it takes for a whiff and a smile. Aroma is dominated by bready, fresh baked biscuit soaked in rich, milk chocolate. There is a good dose of Marzipan also, some thick, treacly chocolate liqueur, light heat, touch of Iranian dates in syrup and savoury fruit mince. Quite rich, decadent, sweet and sultry on the palate with a breathable burn to remind you who is boss. Oily, soft and sticky is the mouthfeel. Almost lifeless with a deeply viscous, fruity, bitter and warming finish that is amazingly shortlived in some lovable elements. As the aroma suggests it has loads of chocolate, biscuit, Marzipan, fruit mince, a hint of lightly roasted coffee bean and carob bean. Husky with a bit too much burnt malt to tense up the tongue between sips. There is nothing truly unique about this one and its links to Porter are just a little flawed but it is definitely an aperitif of a beer suited for slow sipping. Not bad, just not excellent. (12fl.

Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly to fully diminishing.

This is kinda like a simpler, sweeter, boozier, more accessible version of the pitifully underrated Harveys Imperial Stout. Salty smelling (this is more soy-like than Harveys seaweedy character), wine-like tartness, etc. Chocolate kinda dominates the aromatic spectrum, but theres plenty of interesting stuff beyond that so its a joy to sniff. Overall quite enjoyable, but ultimately just too much residual sugar and alcohol to be a 4+ winner. Would recommend that people who like this give the 2008 or later Harveys Imperial a try/retry...its low score is probably partly caused by the older vintages being flat due to the plain cork seals. This is yet another pseudo-brewery along with Stillwater that seems to have switched over to Two Roads for several recipes (or perhaps just use them for the western US market?).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

1499,"2013-09-04",4.0,"The beer pours like dark roast coffee, oozing between a deep brown and a black coloring. It pours with a tiny head of miniscule, dark khaki bubbles (as is expected at this ABV), which quickly slicks into a scrim ring along the glass. The beer leaves a super slick, thin curtain of lacing when it washes over the glass, along with a small set of legs to suggest its alcohol content. In body, the beer is too dark to penetrate, but as it pours it does not seem to be the thickest thing to ever come out of a bottle On the nose, the beer smells richly fruity with dark plum, raisin, and chocolate notes. Brown sugar and dates also appear on the nose, along with the ghost of fusel alcohol. The smell is richly fruity both in malt and yeast character, blending with slight nutty smells. Roast coffee is also present, but it is sitting beside a very pungent raisin/date/plum dipped in brown sugar and chocolate. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly sweet at first, almost cloying with definite alcohol notes, but this perfectly melds into a dry, lightly bitter roast as the beer finishes. There is a light, tart pop at the back of the finish, which adds a level of complexity that I did not expect from this beer. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet plums dipped in a light chocolate. Faint raisins and brown sugar dance on the tongue after the initial flavor, but they are buoyed along by cloying, sweet alcohol that takes a little away from the beer. Luckily, this alcohol is very brief, and is bludgeoned aside by beautiful, dry, French roast coffee. A touch of vanilla and cinnamon, also, bring light spice to the tongue, perhaps from the alcohol, just as the coffee flavor moves in. The finish is light, but long and gives hints of praline, pecans and milk chocolate. In the mouth, this beer feels silky smooth and on the heavy side of medium in body. Carbonation is smooth and velvety, blanketing the tongue in oozing goodness. The mouth is left roasted dry and slightly sticky. Overall, this is a beautifully complex and rich porter. Its thinner mouthfeel and silkiness definitely lend it to the porter style, and not to the thick and chewy stouts, but it works beautifully. I think it could do with a little aging to smooth out the cloying alcohol in the middle of the sip, but I still think its great to drink now.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"
1499,"2013-09-02",3.6,"Deep dark brown coloured body with only a touch of light escaping at the sides with a chocolate milk and violet glow with no head at all - just an oily slick on top.

Full-bodied; Strong assertive alcohol flavour up front with a lot of roasted malt, some dry oak and vanilla, a hit of oatmeal and anise with a warming feel and some nice sweetness at the end. Aftertaste revolves around the roasted malt, alcohol and spice combination with the sugars playing a nice subtle role and finishing dry from the oak. Overall, a fairly good strong porter with a ton of alcohol (and it shows) and a nice subtle spice and sweetness combination that works well and shows a moderate level of complexity.

1499,"2013-07-11",3.9,"Pours black. Quite black. Tiny bit of brown at the edges but this beer is dark. A nice brown head puffed up at first, but it faded after a couple minutes, leaving behind some scummy-looking lacing. The aroma is sweet caramel and cocoa and a lightly acidic roast edge. Theres also a healthy dose of vanilla, dates and a touch of soy, which probably grows as the beer ages. Taste is sweet with lots of toasty malt flavors. Vanilla stands out. The sweetness starts out with light caramel and gets darker and darker. Big chocolate fading into coffee and roast at the end. Toffee, sherry, molasses, mild smoke. Its a little bland upfront, but malt complexity comes out as the beer progresses. Letting the beer warm up helps a lot, too. The aftertaste is chocolate, sherry, Baileys, smoke and roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. This beer isnt quite as refined as the Jesus series, but its a dead solid imperial porter with a great mouthfeel and lots of good flavor for a pretty cheap price.

1499,"2013-01-18",3.7,"In short: A thick viscous big black beer with decent complexity. Good sipper.
How: Tap at Three Penny Taproom, Montpelier VT.
The look: Black body topped by a tiny tan ring of foam.
In long: Nose is rich blackened malts, ground coffee, dark fruits, chocolate.  Taste has pretty much everything that you can expect to find in bit sticky stout/porter, it is chocolaty, it is fruity (prunes, figs), there is molasses, the is sweet black liquorice, pleasant notes of vanilla and also a cloves-like spiciness.  Carbonation is rather soft creating a thick viscous mouthfeel.  This is obviously a very sweet beer but not to the point of being cloying.  The beer is a bit warm but overall I found the alcohol very well hidden considering it is over 11%.  Theres a bit of everything in this beer, it is on the heavy side of course, it is a sipper after all, but drinking a full glass was a pleasure.  A very strong beer indeed, and when I ordered it I asked the barman for its STRONGEST BEER very loudly to make sure everybody heard me, and then I wrestled the glass to the ground, and judging by the stunned look on everybodys face, they were impressed.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Taste is very dense and chewy, some lactic chocolate mousse, thick chocolate silk cake, creme brûlée, even lemon custard. Palate is very dense, ultra silky finishing with some sharp citrus sourness and lemon icebox pie. Woah. This is some good stuff. Very interesting with a medley of dark flavors that I dont think Ive seen together before. Palate gets just a tad papery as it warms.

1499,"2012-09-15",5.0,"The best porter Ive ever tasted, hands down. Im not usually a big fan of Baltic style porters, only because I find them to be too sweet, but this Imperial version is deceptively complex. At first, I thought it was a bit flabby in texture, and totally straightforward in flavor. However, as I continued to sip this voluptuous monster, flavors other than chocolate, toffee, and vanilla began to emerge...leather, tobacco, plum, kumquat, raisin, sandalwood, smoke, Cabernet, and bourbon began to poke out their heads, seemingly out of nowhere. The richness continued to build, but the sweetness never became overbearing, and leveled out at just the right point.

This may be the best Evil Twin Ive tasted, which is even more surprising when one takes note of the fact that its a contract brew executed by Westbrook Brewing Co of Mount Pleasant, S.C. Id never heard of them, but Ill definitely be looking for any future nationally distributed beers of theirs.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"
1499,"2012-09-15",5.0,"Appearance: jet black - motor oil. Fluffy tan head that collapses to a thin ring.

Smell: chocolate, caramel, fruity, a little coffee. Much heavier on the chocolate/fruit than coffee.

Taste: revelatory. Chocolate, fruit, caramel, gentle coffee. This is a porter rather than a stout - the chocolate is up front and centre, the coffee is in the background, but still there.

Mouthfeel: for such a thick beer the mouthfeel is lovely - dense and creamy rather than viscous.

Aftertaste: rich caramel fruit, chocolate, light coffee.

As it warms: the coffee becomes more apparent in the nose, but the flavour leans to more chocolate and fruits.
