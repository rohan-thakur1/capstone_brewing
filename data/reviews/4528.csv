4528,"2017-04-29",3.7,"Slightly hazy dark yellow with nice head that slowly fades off to nothing. Aroma is pilsner with maybe a little more notice of some hops than usual. The taste has a really generous dose of spicy hops that makes this actually good. Think I have finally found my favorite pilsner, just wish I didnt have to get it in the CAN.","Temple, Texas, USA","dlihcsnatas"
4528,"2017-04-29",3.5,"Enjoyed at BTBF 2017. Clear golden color. White foamy head. Floral aroma, hoppy, pilsner grain. Dry flavor, grainy, floral, crisp.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
4528,"2017-04-20",4.1,"Clear golden. Medium bodied. Full of zesty noble hops and a clean malt profile. Its super crisp and clean making it extremely refreshing. Damn fine.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
4528,"2017-04-14",2.4,"Keg @ Saint Arnold. Disappointing headless light gold pour. Nice job of presenting your own beer, guys. Nose is a bit flabby. Fairly robust biscuity malt. Syrupy honey. Light peppery spice on the finish. Modest carb. Light mineral. Less than impressive effort.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4528,"2017-04-09",4.5,"5 OClock Pils has a medium, white head, a semi-clear, yellow-gold appearance, fine suspended sediment, strong bubble streams, and a bit of glass lacing. Aroma is of bold, biscuit malt, sweetness, and grassy hops. Taste is of biscuit, sourdough, and strong, but not harsh, grassy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, and 5 OClock Pils finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT","Laplace, Louisiana, USA","ronaldtheriot"
4528,"2017-03-12",3.8,"Grain. Bread. A little sweet. A hint of musk. Clear pale gold with a bright white sudsy head. Leaves a film on the surface and light suds on the glass. Crisp. Light. A little bit of a bite. Some earth. Some grass. Hoppy bitter finish. Very refreshing. This would have been a better choice for a warm day outside rather than a cold rainy day.","","sjohnny"
4528,"2017-02-16",3.8,"Tap at the friendly place
Pours bright light orange hue with a small fizzy white head and sparse lacing. Spicy grassy nose lots of hops. Flavors exhibit all the same as the nose.

4528,"2016-12-29",2.8,"Very slightly hazy with a thin fluffy white head. Nice aroma with Pilsner grain and nice smooth grassy hop nose. Crisp crackery doughy flavor with a crisp grassy tone and a cracker and pale malt finish. Its fine. A little boring and Americanised but fine.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
4528,"2016-11-29",3.7,"Bottle to glass - pours a clear gold with a sudsy white head... Cascading lace. Aroma is sweet and bready, some apple. Nice spritzy feel yields to a lovely bitter hop finish.

4528,"2016-07-03",4.0,"Top quality pils. Pours clear gold with lots of visual carbonation. Lasting foamy head. Aroma of bread and malt. Medium to light body with a smooth mouth feel. The hop bitterness is just slightly above most czech pilsners but this does not detract from the overall quality and matches style. Finishes slightly dry. An excellent Texas example of a great style.","Garland, Texas, USA","Pershing"

4528,"2016-05-17",3.5,"Tried this a week ago, not a bad pilsner from St. Arnolds. Straight forward Saaz and pils malts in the flavor and taste a bit more aggressive than the usual pilsner you find, but not bad.","Texas, USA","BeerRenter76"
4528,"2016-05-09",3.7,"On tap at Liberty Station. Pours a clear orange gold with medium frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is corn, grain, grass. Medium mouth, similar flavors to nose, light bitterness, crushable, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
4528,"2016-04-27",3.7,"At this point its cliche, A golden bier with a cereal grain aroma, White, foamy lacy head, a little bit of earthy sweetness and grassiness. The best part about this beer is the white blanket it leaves on the glass, and the nice bitter finish.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"

4528,"2016-04-19",3.7,"A pale & golden czech pilsner with a minimal white head. Earthy & bready, its slightly floral with a hint of banana. Soft & lightly sweet, it has a delicate Saaz hops profile with a slightly bitter finsh. Seems to be a hoppier version of their icon series bohemian pilsner released a couple years ago. Nice, clean and exceptionally easy drinking.","","foxtrot44"
