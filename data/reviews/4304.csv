4304,"2016-09-12",3.6,"Did not want to form a head. I saw it was pouring flat, gave it a more aggressive dumping, and just nothing happened but a few bubbles. But the colour is on point, a nice deep rich gold. The aroma has a fair bit of pale malt richness, along with a slightly grassy continental hop. Medium body, towards the full end (which is right for a dortmunder), bringing a balance between clean pale malts, a restrained hop bitterness. A touch of hop dryness and character carries through to the finish. The malts could be breadier, but the hop balance is just right, showing through while leaving the malt to be the star. All told, this is a pretty good dortmunder.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4304,"2016-03-14",3.0,"On tap at St. Augustines, pours a clear copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of toasted biscuity malt. Flavour is along the same lines, with toasted biscuity malt and a gentle dry hopping to provide balance. Clean and refreshing, it drinks well. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4304,"2016-03-11",3.4,"Appearance: Illuminated brass orb and shadowed by encroaching wings. 

Aroma: Sweet breads with grain crusts welcome the nose. Less prominent are dandelion leaves and flower buds, but they do manage to peek through the doughy foundation. 

Taste: Those flower buds are far less coy in the mouth than in the nose, dusting the imbiber with sweet leaf aromatics. After the floral wave grassy herbs soon start to rampage. The message here is that this libation has been lagered by ruminants, deer, in particular, who have mashed together seed imbedded crusts with rich spears of grass of which these four legged munchers are connoisserus. 

Palate: Smooth and teetering on flatness. 

Overall: One mug suffices as the vegetable musings that is this beer tend to creep about before completely entangling the senses. I liken the moment to an encounter with aesthetics not far removed from Gaeas earthy furrows and verdant bowers.","British Columbia, CANADA","Kobold"
4304,"2015-06-28",4.0,"Pleasant aroma of flowery hops. The colour is perfect and the beer is very clear. Nice white head with good retention for this type of beer.

Taste is very smooth, and slightly sweet. Mild hoppy finish, although crisp enough, leaving a very mild bitter taste. Definitely a good beer, and far above the mainstream pale lagers.

Mouthfeel is as it should be, thin, dry, and not too long is aftertaste","","weissbierdrinker"
4304,"2014-09-07",3.2,"650ml bottle pours a pale golden amber color with a finger of white head that leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is grass, light citrus and spicy with some grains. Taste is spicy and grassy hop bitterness with some light citrus and grainy malt sweetness. A good body and carbonation for the style. One of the better lagers I have tried, definitely recommended.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
4304,"2014-07-12",3.1,"650ml bottle. Light, grassy and floral. Gentle sweetness. A decently-crafted, but very mellow brew.","","LarryBeast"
4304,"2014-04-30",4.0,"Bomber. Clear bright golden yellow, white cumulus lasting foam. Floral toasted lager malt aroma. Clean toasted pale lager malt taste, slightly bready, mild floral herbal noble influence, very faint hint of citrus. Average carbonation, medium bodied, lightly hopped. Well done, wish more brewers would craft fine lagers like this! LF (Lagerboy Friendly)","British Columbia, CANADA","Lagerboy"
4304,"2014-03-15",3.2,"Lasting white frothy head atop a mildly carbonated amber body. Nose of grass and corn. Flavour is fairly light and crisp with weeds upfront and cereal in the background. Okay.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
4304,"2014-03-12",3.6,"On draught at Garrick-i-know-theres-no-apostrophe-because-garri Head, Victoria. Clear light amber, white head. Nose is bread, crackery malts, floral. Flavour is floral, cracker, lingering dry malt, bubbly carbonation. A lot of depth in this one, not too heavy or sweet, really nice lager!","Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA","WheatKing"
4304,"2014-03-08",2.9,"Draught at Alibi Room, VancouverHazy light amber color with small creamy head. Dry, smooth, very bready, and nothing else. I had higher expectations on this one...","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
4304,"2014-03-07",3.3,"Jaune claire avec une mousse blanche moyenne qui reste longtemps. Larôme des céréales et malt. Cest aussi un peu florale. Le goût est dabord du malt puis un acidité et amertume rappellent dun pilsner en finale.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","vadie"
4304,"2014-03-05",3.8,"650 ml bottle. Pours a clear clear gold with moderate head. Aromas of flowers, grain, and corn. Deep flavors of fresh bread, toast, and malt extract.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Gerbeer"
