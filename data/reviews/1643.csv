1643,"2014-08-07",2.8,"I have had this many times and it is usually delicious - my 2nd favourite beer at the Wig and Pen. However last time I got it, 26 July 2014, I think it was a bad batch - lactic acid sourness, not very pleasant. I hope its back to normal next time and I can revise this rating because its usually an absolutely fantastic stout.","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"

1643,"2014-03-12",3.3,"Tasted 5/3/2014. Draught at ""Wig & Pen"", Canberra. Poured an opaque black with a one-finger tan frothy head that retained well and provided filmy lace for the whole drink. Aroma of nice soft mild roasted malt with richness as well as a trace of coffee; roasted malt remained mild for the whole drink. Taste quite sweet caramel with a slightly bitter roasted grain. Medium body. Smooth, soft, creamy and slightly dry with a trace of roasted grain on the finish. Very good!","Tarragindi, AUSTRALIA","KeefOz"
1643,"2013-08-20",3.7,"On tap at the Wig & Pen in Canberra. The pub was full and loud, but I had to try this before turning away. Great stout. Creamy with plenty of nitro, sour, full of chocolate, ashes and that constant dryness and medium body. Very much like a Murphys. It could have been better enjoyed had it been served at a higher temperature.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
1643,"2013-07-01",3.7,"Had on Nitro at Wig and Pen in Canberra

Jet black with a thin, light brownish cream head. Looks like guinness. Shocker. Excellent lacing left through drinking. Layers and layers of film. 

Nose is roast, coffee, chocolate, cream, treacle, and slightly woody. 
Taste is roast, coffee, chocolate, cream . Very straightforward. 
Medium bodied. nearly perfect carbonation for the style. Dry roast, chocolate and coffee finish with good touches of spicy bitterness. 
Does not dissappoint","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"
1643,"2012-12-07",3.8,"Nitro tap. Black with a small light tan hed that coats the glass. Aroma: dark roast, licorice, treacle. Taste has roasted malt, burnt caramel, singed cream, licorice. Grassy, slightly spicy bitterness. Like everything you want to be in draft Guinness. Lovely.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

1643,"2009-05-30",4.0,"Draught at Wig & Pen, Canberra. Pours dark brown with reddish hues and a creamy brown head that left a nice lacing around the glass. Coffee dominates the aroma with notes of cocoa as well. The flavour is roasted coffee (no surprise), dark chocolate and cream. Literally a velvet smooth mouthfeel and a pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish, which makes this a very easy drinker. Absolutely delicious.","Boomtown!, AUSTRALIA","nate2g"
1643,"2008-07-26",3.5,"Tap at the brew pub; nitro.

Clean easy-drinking stout, some chocolate, a bit of coffee and licorice, relatively sweet.  Interesting fruit/spicy touches. Nice beer again; nothing exceptional but really solid.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
1643,"2008-03-29",3.6,"Tried on tap in lovely Canberra. This one looked the goods, black body with a small but lasting light tan head and solid rings of lacing again. Burnt notes in the aroma with coffee and grains in the taste. Not too complex or anything ust very easy to drink.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
1643,"2007-12-23",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2008 Draught at the brewhouse. Arrived a pitch black colour, with a dense creamy tan head which was fully lasting and left rings of lace. Aroma was of milky espresso, with coffee sweets, dark and white chocolate and some burnt malts. Taste had bucket loads of milky/strong coffee, with some dark chocolate, burnt malts, some licorice and touched of vinalla in the back. Body was medium to full with a thick and creamy texture, soft carbonation and a good finish. Truly one of the best stouts I have ever had.","Southern Highlands, AUSTRALIA","MBison"
1643,"2007-06-15",3.8,"Arrived at my table with a rich complex black colour with a smooth and creamy head.  Chocolate predominates.  Huge depth.  Not really comparable to other stouts as it almost stands alone in terms of style.  Abit sweet but well balanced.","Canberra ACT, AUSTRALIA","madquacker"
1643,"2007-03-05",4.4,"There is no better stout. The head is so beautiful you feel a criminal to destroy it, it feels gorgeous to drink it. An amazing prize and a shame it isnt distributed.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","edwardfricker"
1643,"2006-12-17",3.8,"Yep, king of the stouts and with good reason.  Smooth and plenty creamy with so much chocolate and cream flavour that its like a meal all at once.  Best Aussie stout by a considerable margin as most are watery and without flavour.  Excellent","AUSTRALIA","lasonovich"
1643,"2006-05-27",3.7,"28 Mar 2006 - Nice swwet choc roated malt aroma.  Black-dark brown colour with good lasting head and lacing.  Sweet choc-coffee malt flavour.  Choc roasted malt aftertaste.  The best of the bunch in my tastings today at the W&P.","Glen Iris, AUSTRALIA","vanvenlo"
1643,"2006-05-26",3.7,"This delicious beer just had me thinking of tiramisu, which isnt a bad thing. Lots of creamy coffee and dark chocolate, but could do better without the nitro IMHO, which instills a smoothness that seems to truncate the flavours a bit unfortunately.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"
1643,"2006-04-03",3.5,"Jet black with a perfectly formed coffee coloured head. Nose doesnt give much away; faint chocolate roasted notes at best. Excellent texture. Dark chocolate notes, appropriately creamy, on a very low fizz palate. Easy to see why this is the top ranked beer from the house.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"
1643,"2006-03-29",3.1,"Malt aroma. Black coca cola colour with a very big thick foamy head. Malt roasted chocolate flavour with a dash of bitterness. Smooth palate.","Glen Iris, AUSTRALIA","Lunkie"
1643,"2006-02-07",3.5,"Draught (nitro dispensed) at the brewpub.  Really black, creamy beige head. Fruity licorice aroma. Intense ans soldly malty with soft, creamy mouthfeel. Tarry, bitter finish. Unlike most nitro dispensed beers it doesnt feel dead and stale, but rather fresh and complex.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1643,"2006-01-06",3.9,"I missed this by minutes at a beer festival a few months back when it ran out while I paddled in a pool of mediocre-to-crap lagers and pale ales. I was naiively saving this for later while smarter drinkers hoovered it up. Im not surprised it went quickly because its a bit special. At the brewpub, its served nitrogenated at 4-6C, which is an improvement on 99.99% of pub serving temps but still seemed a fraction too cold. It arrived looking as black as the hole in Canberra where our tax dollars disappear. It comes with the sort of faultless tight, thick head that is typical of nitro. Great head length. It may have been the serving temperature but the aroma took time to fully develop. Essentially sweet and chocolatey, with the intensity of a dark chocolate liqueur and a solid roasted malt backbone. Fabulous full and creamy mouthfeel, like whipped cream. Very integrated flavour profile - coffee cream chocolates, chocolate ice cream, sweet milky coffee. Very much at the sweeter end of the dry stout scale - theres nothing sharp about the flavours here. For a nitro, this may be as good as it gets. (Draught at brewpub with omhper)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
1643,"2005-08-29",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2005 On tap at the Wig & Pen.  Great, thick, creamy smooth stout with definite cream and coffee tones.  Wicked head, thick as they get and oh so smooooth.  Cracker palate, very creamy.  Only problem is that it begins to taste a tad watery after a while, could use a bit more acohol perhaps.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","DrunkenCumquat"
1643,"2005-07-13",4.1,"Lots of flavour in this stout. The most notable to my palate being a chocolate/coffee flavour that provides just the right amount of bitterness for this style of stout. The mouthfeel is great---creamy.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Peptis"
1643,"2005-06-25",4.0,"Body as black as the night and head opaque. Looks big and is big. Loved the way it wasnt too bitter and not too burnt - this allowed the flavour of the malts to shine though. Slight sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel. Great aussie stout.","AUSTRALIA","Nesta13"

1643,"2004-09-22",3.4,"I found the aroma satisfying. Heavy in roasted malt, which gave it a creamy mouthfeel. Lots of flavour, including a hint of a hint of cherry. (NFOB2004)","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","Mullo"
1643,"2004-09-17",3.6,"NFOB 2004. On tap in a plastic cup (sigh). Deep purple/black colour, fairly small head. A very good stout featuring  roasted chocolate/coffee flavours. Unfortunately for this beer it is the shadow of its big imperial brother. Nice though.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","winkle"
1643,"2003-12-30",3.6,"Transparent black colour, great head retention but you'd expect that off nitro.
Really good, grainy, roasty aroma (like dark rye bread now that Betty mentions it). 
Good solid malt, roasty but certainly not burnt like Coopers Stout. Would have liked more bitterness though. Slightly creamy body but seemed a lot closer to regular gas than Guinness, Kilkenny etc (which is good of course). With more bitterness this would be my favourite stout, as it is it's still very good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"
1643,"2003-12-21",3.0,"Interesting to note how much the other guys liked this as this sort of stout should be right up my alley; certainly a very roasty brew and a little sweet with some hint of banana, did not have the intensity of coffee, chocolate flavours I had expected.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
1643,"2003-11-26",4.0,"Bloody nice and pretty creamily smooth and all that. Rather than a chocolate or roast malt wack in the face like many Aussie stouts, this seemed to carry a dark rye bread flavour which was great. Nice beer!","Walgett, NSW, AUSTRALIA","Betty"
1643,"2003-10-17",4.1,"had this on tap at the nfob03 and on nitro at the brewoub a week later and both times it was great stuff. very dark purple, initial flavour a strange mix of coffee and plum, though the plum died down. some strange all bran in the finish instead of bitterness. on nitro the aroma was a more pronounced coffee liqueur. tasted of chocolate and vanilla cream. low on hops but a lush, rich reward","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
1643,"2003-10-02",4.0,"Mine wasn't nitro unlike eczematics. Deep brown to black. Really nice stout. Smell of roasted malt and chocolate. very chcocolatey and roasty, with a soft, rounded mouthfeel. Some tart acidity surprisingly. Finish is bitter and rich. A lovely stout, one of my fave Aussie beers. Had at the Brissy Festival of beers.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
1643,"2003-09-29",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2007 nitro, which is annoying, but what a beer underneath. sure its a guinness clone, but its a great one. classic (if im allowed to decide whats classic) dry stout aroma of crisp hops and ash. VERY full bodied. flavour is really nicely balanced between the burnt stuff, the malt sweetness, and a good amount of refreshing hop flavour. tastes like the same yeast as lincs foreign extra which be the guinness yeast i think so no wonder. nice after-dinner mint aftertaste. if only this was on cask instead it could be incredible. rer8: 6% these days apparently, feels even bigger and fatter, except i looked back at my rating and said it was fullbodied anyway. a big stout, very roasty/bitter and chunky. quality.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
