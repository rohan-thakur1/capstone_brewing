Tons of a good milk chocolate and a little sour coffee but acceptable (less sour aftertaste than some of the Cycle beers). Hazelnuts are definitely strong, but they do not dominate and they seem extremely natural, which is the most important. Lovely bourbon barrel composition, it wouldnt be that awesome without it.

1038,"2017-02-28",4.1,"650ml bottle shared with brother. Thanks Luis. Aroma: intense hazelnuts, not much else. Maybe bourbon a bit. App: black with small dark brown head, little retention, little lacing. Taste and palate: full body, smooth and sweet, lots of hazelnuts, alcohol and really subtle bitter finish. Overall: good stuff. Hazelnuts can be a bit too much after a few sips but I like hazelnuts so it doesnt bother too much. Body is different than other Cycle Ive had. Its less liquoreux and more sweet. Still appreciable, just not used to that coming from then. Aging it would probably make it more liquoreux. Anyway, a great imperial stout again. Thanks again Cycle for a great beer.

1038,"2017-02-26",3.7,"Shared with ebone1988 and Gus for the Cycle Trademark Set tasting bonanza. 22 oz bottle, green label. The pour is a medium black with a thicker khaki colored head and a light bubbly ring and no lace. The aroma is really boozy with a decent nuttiness that comes in and carries out. Its sweet. Not the bitter hazelnut that I was thinking like the old one was. There is a light chocolate going on, but its a little different. The flavor is a little more booze forward. There is a lightly more bitter and carries a light roast and hint of chocolate on the back end. The mouth feel is decently viscous with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly bitter alcohol and nuttiness. Its not terrible, but not as good as Id expect. Earlier Rating: 1/6/2016 Total Score: 4.522 oz bottle I got from Ryan. Thanks man! The pour is a light black. It's got some cola brown around the edges. There is a dark khaki head that falls all the way down. The aroma is amazing. There is an incredible nuttiness and a ton of cocoa that I wasn't anticipating. It's like a dry hazelnut powder and it's just delightful. The flavor is even better. The chocolate and nuttiness are amazingly complex. The barrel pokes through a little more prominently here. The bourbon is a little reserved and there are light hints of vanilla. The mouth feel is fantastic. It's thick and chewy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly hazelnutty, cocoa powder finish. This is spectacular.

1038,"2017-01-31",4.5,"Pours an oily black color with a stable, fluffy dark brown head.

Smells almost like Nutella - lots of fudge, cream, toffee and milk chocolate get enriched by toasty hazelnuts. Pretty sweet, like dessert, with a smoky roast touch, amping up the chocolate. The Bourbon barrel isnt overly hot or too present, it just adds a nice layer of oak and spices to the decadent sweetness.

Drinks sweet and smooth, with a soft carbonation to it, producing a medium bodied beer, which drinks surprisingly easy while providing a nice depth.

Brings an initial rock sugar rush to the palate, together with wooden, roasty hazelnuts and a huge amount of mousse au chocolate, establishing a pleasant silkness rightaway. A short coffee glimpse, together with the oaken barrel add a nice dryness to the prominent chocolate sweetness without distracting or changing the beers focus all too much. Whipped cream shows the most during the long finish, together with licorice, molasses and peppery spices, slowly overpowering the initial milk chocolate sweetness with lots of maintaining roasty hazelnuts.

Awesomly tasty beer! Complex, yet focussed on the chocolate-hazelnut tandem, together with a roasty bitterness and a luscious amount of soft whipped cream. This got consumed insanely fast by us, unusually for a stout this high in abv, which would usually last for a whole sitting, but this one makes you continuing drinking, while revealing a satisfying depth of flavors at the same time.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Medium-bodied, but a touch thin with laid-back carbonation. The flavor features nuttiness, toastiness and dark chocolate that lingers a good while after each sip. So rich, yet drinkable. This could be dangerous. Thanks to 50belair for sharing this world class brew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
