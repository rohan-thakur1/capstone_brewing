4385,"2015-09-11",3.8,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Pours dark brown. Black in the glass. Small off white head. Smells nutty and chocolatey with a touch of oak and maybe whiskey if I really convince myself. Unmistakable lager yeast aromas make it a little fruity, maybe? Tastes of bitter chocolate and nutty malts. Some hop bitterness. Bready finish, but very little barrel. Just a bit of whiskey in the aftertaste. Medium heavy. Well carbonated. Unexpectedly good. Barrel is subtle but the base beer is very well made.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
4385,"2015-08-25",3.7,"Bottle. I like this more than I did a few months ago. The whiskey flavor has mellowed. It is very dark brown for a lager, some red. Aroma has whiskey and malt. Flavor is medium sweet, and I taste the toffee in this beer, especially as it warms. Palate seems heavy for a lager. good beer.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
4385,"2015-08-14",3.8,"Red brown pour light cream foam. Aroma brown sugar, tangy, slight whiskey. Tastes toffee caramel coffee. tonnes of flavor for a lager, but still light.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"

4385,"2015-06-11",3.6,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 6-7-15. Nice, dark lager aroma. Smells substantial but lean. Scents of roasted malts and carmelization. Subdued but likable smell. Pours dark brown with a moderate amount of taupe head. Slight reddish hue. Pretty good lacing. Looks good. Very nice, unusual, malty flavor. Tastes like very well done (in terms of cooking) caramel. Flavors of freshly baked pumpernickel bread and bread dough. I definitely get a whiskey-like flavor element from the barrel. Tasty and different. Medium body but full for a lager. Frothy in the palate. Not as crisp as I would like a lager to be. Overall, this beer is quite well made. The taste does get a little tiresome after a while. Nonetheless, its an interesting and likable beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
4385,"2015-06-02",3.9,"Bottle. This is very, very well made. Dark dense pour. Rich yet clean aroma and taste - mild toffee, maybe a hint of peat, hint of chocolate. Everything in balance, nothing muddled whatsoever - really, this is great.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
4385,"2015-06-02",3.7,"On draught
Pours basically black with a big head ad lots of lacing on the glass.

The aroma is nicely roasty, rich, and has plenty of wood character. There are mild notes of licorice. Its sweet smelling, but hot horribly so. 

The flavor is nicely roasty & woody with some vanilla and mild sweetness. The barrel characteristic is pleasantly reserved but certainly noticeable. The beer has some light fruitiness, cherry most specifically. 

A fun one.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
4385,"2015-05-11",3.7,"Aroma is fruit, malts and vanilla. The flavor is fruit, vanilla, malts and a mildly sweet/warming finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
4385,"2015-05-06",3.5,"Pour out of 12 oz bottle, dark black pour with off white head, aroma brought notes of dark fruit, cocoa, slight whiskey into some vanilla, dark coffee, some spice. Taste was a mix of dark chocolate, roast, nice vanilla into a bit of whiskey, hints of earth, some slight oak, finishing fairly sweet, slightly dry. Pretty tasty.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4385,"2015-05-03",3.3,"Bottle, pours a reddish dark brown body with a brown head. Aroma of dark malts, bread, some mustiness with hints of vanilla and oak. Taste is mainly malts and chocolate with some hints of vanilla and oak.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","zeke626"
4385,"2015-04-29",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a dark amber with a tan head that dissipates quickly to the edges. Aroma has lots of dark bread with some roast with a bit of barrel and some underlying toffee. Flavor has a good amount of toffee and sweet dark grains with a bit of chocolate, char and a light barrel note in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
4385,"2015-04-24",3.5,"Pours deep brown to black with a medium tam head that dissapates. Oak, grain and basement musk aroma. Oak and vanilla up front with slight dark fruit and vanilla in the middle. Booze, mustiness and wiskey end it.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","undsioux7"
4385,"2015-04-23",3.5,"(bottle) This CABA beer pours a black color which turns dark brown when held to the light. The nose reveals prominent damp cave notes which are accompanied by charred barrel, roasted malt, chocolate, smoked gouda, and faint vanilla. Theres also some musty lager yeast, but Im not sure how much is here, as it could be those prominent damp cave notes which are yielding this scent. The flavor tastes more along the lines of a schwarzbier that contains a dash of whiskey, as theres a nice interplay between roast-laden chocolate and faint vanilla which rounds out to a bit of a cream soda/cola vibe on the finish before more prominent oak and slight char settle into the mix. A bit of coconut emerges with warming as well as more of those damp cave notes present in the aroma, but again Im vexed by how much damp cave vs. musty lager yeast there is here. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is a touch lively. Overall this is a decent beer, but not one Ill find to be particularly memorable.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
4385,"2015-04-20",3.9,"Very dark brown color with a medium head. Light roasty and malty aroma. A bit buttery, like Munich malt. Strong biscuit, grain, and caramel flavor. Moderate bourbon, leaning boozy and raw oak over sweet vanilla. Dryish finish. Really nice!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4385,"2015-04-20",3.5,"12oz bottle pours a dark cola brown with ruby highlights and a medium khaki head. Light oak barrel aroma, with roasted malts, vanilla, toffee, caramel and tootsie roll. Upfront whiskey barrel that rolls back, before it becomes to overwhelming, into mellow roasted malts, chocolate and toffee. Pretty nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
4385,"2015-04-10",4.2,"Good stuff. Get some oak, booze, cola, vanilla. Drinks smooth with a little bite and booze in the back end.","Minneapolis, ","Obfuscate"
4385,"2015-04-05",4.0,"Pours an amber brown color with a lingering short head. Aroma of barrel, vanilla, prune, and roasty grain. Flavors of roasty grain, barrel, vanilla, prune/cherry, and brown sugar. Very interesting and tasty.","Richfield, Minnesota, USA","nsquishee"
