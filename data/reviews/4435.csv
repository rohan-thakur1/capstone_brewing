4435,"2017-06-14",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2017 375 ml bottle, bottled 02-05-2014, shared by Werckmeister, thanks!
Dark ruby body, with a small, pinkish head. 
Aroma of sour cherries, funk, cheese, unripe fruits, sour citrus, wood. 
Tastes of oak, sour cherries, cheese, barnyard, green apples, some unripe pears. 
Light, slick mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finishes dry, acidic, wooden, a bit funky, fruity, with cherries, pears, apples. 

Very nice. Lovely, intense nose, with loads of funky and sour cherries notes. Taste is a bit raw, a bit less complex, while still well balanced. Overall not my favourite Kriek Ive had, but still a great style example.

4435,"2016-11-26",4.4,"Jest to młody Lambic z dodatkiem 40% wiśni. Niefiltrowany. Spontanicznie fermentowany w butelce.
Bez jakichkolwiek dodatków środków aromatyzujących lub barawiących.
Uwarzony z 60% słodu jęczmiennego, 40% słodu pszenicznego, chmielu, świeżych wiśni (400g na litr piwa) i wody.   
 Data butelkowania:  02.05.2014 
 Data ważności:  02.05.2019 
 Kolor:  Głęboko czerwony, intensywnie wiśniowy, dość czysty.
 Piana:  Jak nie trudno się domyślić piany w głębszym kontekście brak.
Na samym początku była odrobina różowego puszku, który w szaleńczym tempie zredukował się do zera.
Nie pozostawił żadnych śladów na ściankach.
Po zamieszaniu kielichem tylko na sekundę piana unosi się do góry.
Obrączki nad piwem nie ma się co doszukiwać. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest przezajebisty!
Po odkorkowaniu pierwsze skojarzania kołatają wokół stajennych, wiejskich i dzikich detali.
Jast i końska derka i spocony koń i nawet sporo skórzanego aromatu.
Kolejne skojarzenia są już wybitnie owocowe: wiśnie, czereśnie i odrobina czerwonych porzeczek.
Kropeczką nad ""i"" są elementy migdałów i odrobina beczkowej wanilii.
Klasa! Jestem już w połowie drogi do raju. 
 Smak: W smaku potężnie owocowe w klimacie dojrzałych półsłodkich czereśni, które po kilku łykach przechodzą w bardziej kwaśne wiśnie.
Dochodzą do tego bardzo subtelne nuty stajenne, pasek skórzany, końska derka.
Wybitnie winne, kwaśne, ale jeszcze nie octowe.
Po ogrzaniu wychodzą dziksze klimaty w stylu ""funky"".
Po jakimś czasie dołącza do zabawy bardzo stonowana wanilia.
Piwo daje się polubić od pierwszego łyku.
Jego dostojność podkreśla całkiem gęsta tekstura i gładkie odczucie w ustach.
Goryczka jest niemal zerowa, delikatny kwaśny finisz, który nie powoduje uczucia wykrzywiania twarzy, wręcz przeciwnie - zaprasza po kolejną porcję trunku.
Pijalność nieograniczona.
Perfekcyjny trunek. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:   

Jest to młody Lambic z dodatkiem 40% wiśni. Niefiltrowany. Spontanicznie fermentowany w butelce.

Uwarzony z 60% słodu jęczmiennego, 40% słodu pszenicznego, chmielu, świeżych wiśni (400g na litr piwa) i wody.

Trunek szczególny, szlachecki.
Od samego początku podkreśla swoją arystokratyczną wartość.
Początkowo kolorem - głęboką wiśniową czerwienią, potem smakiem, gładkim i zrównoważonym, ale zarazem intensywnym i głębokim.
Na sam koniec oczarowuje smakiem - winnym, lekko kwaśnych, wiśniowym, trochę dzikim, trochę wiejskim, trochę skórzanym i stajennym. 
Finalnie puentuje akcentami delikatnej wanilii i szczypty karmelu.
Nic mi więcej do szczęścia nie potrzeba.
To już nie jest piwo to coś pomiędzy piwem, a winem.

4435,"2015-07-02",4.0,"(375ml 2014 bottle from Brewberry Cave, Paris) Pours opaque deep reddish purple with a short lived small pinkish head and no lace. Aroma is intensely (!) dominated by tart cherry flesh and skin. Moderate cider vinegar acidity is balanced by a bit of sweetness to give a sour cherry pie filling quality. Typical 3F funk with some notes of wet vegetation, musty, soft barnyard, just a bit of wood. Flavour is serious sour cherry, flesh and acidic tartness with lemony lactic quality. The funk is is restrained and limited to a wet earthy character in the middle. The finish is moderately lactic and the aftertaste dry, with a good helping of cherry flesh and skin remaining. Medium bodied with fairly light carb. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is a very cherry-dominated kriek, the criticism being that it crowds some of the other flavours that make up a more complex lambic out. Its really quite nice stuff as youd expect from 3 Fonteinen, it just doesnt quite have the full package to match the fruit concentration like LPP Kriek.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

4435,"2015-05-28",4.0,"12.7 oz bottle, poured into a tulip at ~45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep actually-ruby-red red, and forms a finger head of pink foam which dies swiftly in a rush of fizzing. Carbonation is visible all over the sides of the glass at first, but vanishes before the glass is halfway drunk.

Smell: Sour cherry leaps out of the glass, as one would expect. Beneath the tart fruit, there is a haze of funky mildew, not unlike what one can smell when wandering through a building that has stood abandoned for some time.

Taste: Mildly tart, sour cherries greet the tongue as each sip begins, before fading a bit in the middle to allow shades of mildew through. During the middle, the beer takes on something of a wine character as the funk interplays with the cherries, yielding some almost tannic fruit notes of plum and red grape, with hints of hardwood. By the finish, the tart cherry returns, to leave a lingering memory of sour cherries and gentle, mildewy funk clinging to the tongue.

Mouthfeel: This starts out as a wildly prickly, highly carbonated beer, and becomes nigh completely flat by the end of the glass (which likely helped prompt my ""wine character"" observation of the taste). It is fairly thin, but does not turn watery, even at the finish.

Overall: An interesting kriek, though at the price point, likely not one I shall repeat. This would be a nigh perfect beer to give to a wine advocate looking into the world of beer.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Has a lively carbonation, bready soft malts, which interact well with the huge, but gentle cherry fruitiness. At no point does the sourness of this beer roll over the fruity cherry impression, which comes along with red vinous grapes and a subtle oak defined maltiness. Bretts stay in the background of the composition, they only support the cherries with an enjoyable tartness in the end, accompanying the fermented fruits. Oakiness goes incredibly well with the bursting cherries print, exposing their full-bodied, smooth fruitiness. Wine and oak define the body of this beer, leading to a never before experienced, well balanced, superior cherry fruitiness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

4435,"2014-05-25",3.8,"A head to head sour off between the Mikkeller Frederiksdal (MF) and the 3 Fonteinen Intense Red (IR) : Served a same temps and in same glasses. Both display a beautiful crimson hue with mostly lasting but small pink head. The MF had a slight better head and slight deeper rose hue but really both are very pretty. Both get a 5 from me.  The aroma of the MF seems sweeter and has some Diacetyl undertones, more like a candied cherry with a bit of horseblanket and cheesy funk. The IR diplays even more wild yeast notes of farmyard and cat pee along with a more vibrant cherry vapour. Clear win for the IR, 9 to 6. The taste of the MF is cherry, candi sugar, oak, earthiness and a moderate lactic acid. I really like the well stated oak character but wished the sourness would pop more. The IR is surprisingly tamer than expected, seem defiantly more Oude Lambic with a softer fruitiness, smoother oak and earthiness and some pity undertones. Whilest the MF does have than candied tone, it is a tad more expressive and complex. The IF could have use a bit more younger kriek in the blend. Slight edge to the MF 8 to 7.  Mouth feel: The MF is a touch sticky and a faintly noticeable alcohol/ band-aid finish. The IR is so smooth and rich tannins, almost too smooth for its own good considering it was suppose to be ""intense"". Still I would give the IR the upper hand due to the band-aid on the MF. IR=4, MF=3.  and finally overall judgement... I like both brews for their high points but felt letdown by the low points. More good than bad... perhaps the wild yeasties will clean up the Mikkeller Frederiksdal (15). The 3 Fonteinen Intense Red already seems past prime but only slightly so, it had a higher letdown factor and therefore a lower overall score (13) but the total win IR 3.8 and MF 3.7","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Slow to recede. High clarity, very light on bubbles. Lees en bouteille.Lightly tart black cherry notes are meaty, fresh and as authentic as can be. Just a brush of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar, as cherries run deep but lead to a clear horsecrap note (sulphur, very light) that is tremendously endearing. ""Ahhhh, this one was going splendidly until I got to the notes of horse poop...then it really got good!"" How I ever came to enjoy smelling farm animal poop in my beer, Ill never know. Anywyas, this stuff is fantastic, if a bit reserved. The cherries are done magnificantly, but I could see getting a little crazier, bacteria-wise. That being said, young krieks are very cherry-dominated and you cant ask for a wealth of funk this early. Id be surprised if this one dosent develop plenty of character over the next few+ years.Acetone and lactic acid are bright and eye-opening on first sip. The hard sourness, outdoing even the fresh malic acids from the cherries, is a bit shocking from 3F. That being said, I dont know why Im shocked, I havent had a 3F lambic in a long, long time (6 years...). Unfortunately, the body immediately gives way to a watery texture and bit of thinness. The palate adjusts quickly to the sourness, which seems to evaporate as the beer breathes and warms. Tart, tooth-cleaning acids and plentiful unripe lime flavor are robed in tart cherry and finish with a malic/acetic ""sweetness"" (relative to the sourness the yeast imparts). Stunning flavor, cant find much fault with that. The body, however, you can. I certainly dont mind that the body is thin and watery, as it just makes it more sessionable. Unfortunately, I didnt win the lottery, so I cant drink this as a session beer. So yes, would prefer a good deal more carbonation up front and barring that, just a more supple body to really carry the flavor. Great though and gave me goosebumps (seriously) from this being my first 3F in 6 or 7 years.  9/4/8/3/162014 bottle, drunk 9/9/16.Without going too in depth here, suffice to say that this one had the same lovely cherry pit/cherry meat flavor as the prior bottle but seemed even more thin.  Almost more akin to a cherry berliner weisse or random American wild ale with cherries.  Just doesnt have the malt/wheat backbone, nor any depth whatsoever.  As well, the lambic is a little bit sparse, being comprised mostly of tart brett acids adding lime and guava.  Some black pepper and more cherry pit are enjoyable, on the finish, but its very lacking overall.  Score is for this bottle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4435,"2014-01-18",3.6,"Bottle. Deep ruby red pour, pink head. Decent retention/no lace. Aroma of cherry, funk, dust, barrel. Taste is lightly tart, cherry, medicinal, vinous, light mineral, light funk. Palate is soft, coating, sweet/tart cherry finish.","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"

4435,"2014-01-12",3.6,"Bottled Nov 2012. Pours clear red to form a dark red beer with a hint of a pink head. Smell - very slight cherry. More leaves - spinach, spearmint. Red wine and cider. Body is medium and carbonation is fairly high. Taste - rounded, almost meaty up front. Sour, tart and tooth-coatingly sweet (but not nearly as sweet as most beers in the style), sherbet. Again, just a bit of cherry coming through with some caramelly malts. Finishes crisp, dry and tannic like wine. I like it - its interesting - but not worth the cash in my opinion. My girlfriend says it tastes like cider thats gone off.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

4435,"2013-12-24",3.5,"Bottle served right before an Allagash Coolship Red for comparison sake.


A - Pours ruby red with a fizzy half finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace what so ever on the sides of the glass.


S - Smells pretty weird honestly. Tons of must dominate from start to finish. Hints of tart cherries, mild funk, oak and candy sweetness offer a bit of relief but the must is just too strong.


T - Thankfully the taste is a little better than the nose. Starts off with a mix of sweetness and mild tartness from the cherries quickly being joined by the ever present must, horse blanket funk, dry oak and some light mineral quality rounds things out. Finish is kind of sweet with some musty tartness, not lingering for very long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Sweet, tart feel going pretty thin quickly. Not very lambic like honestly.


O - Decent but probably my least favorite Drie Fonteinen to date. The must is out of control and the cherries just cant make up the difference. Compared to the Allagash Red this was nowhere near as good, and they are about the same age.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

This was another great deal at Dutchs - $3.00 for three ounces was about the same price as picking up a bottle but without the risk. I still have one in the cellar which I plan to share as it is a decent lambic. Even so Schaerbeekse Kriek is still slightly better and about the same cost per ounce.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep ruby red body sits like beet juice complete with sticky legs. It is almost someone pureed a bunch of cherries and left them to ferment. Ripe Bing cherries and a balanced sourness is marginally more intense than the Schaerbeekse. However the difference is minimal overall.

Flavor / Palate - The same cherry taste sparkles in the tongue and throat. It starts off mild before morphing into a total fruit bomb. This definitely becomes intense by the end; more than five ounces in a sitting would take time. Its worth trying once at least especially if you find it in Belgium.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4435,"2013-10-31",4.2,"Pours an extremely dark red with a very pink head that rises and falls relatively quickly.

The aroma is really akin to a red wine, its fruity but not sweet smelling, oaky, & lightly tannic. The funkiness is fairly mild, at least for a lambic, admittedly its got some rustic barn yardy character, but theyre more subdued here. 

The flavor is very cherry forward, but you know... not sweet. Its a nicely dry, tart, and oaky beer... akin to a bold red wine in many aspects. The cherry character is interesting, very tart and very bright., almost like cherry pie in its richness of cherry flavor, but again real low on sweetness.

Not as dry and effervescent as I expected, with only low to medium carbonation. Lingering cherry malt left on the palate. Very much on the lambic and wheat flavor more so than the cherry overall, which is good and keeps it from being medicinal like I get from some krieks.

4435,"2013-09-23",3.7,"375mL thanks to Travlr as a going away present. Was supposed to cellar this one but oh, well. Pours a clear, inky purple. Low pink foam with sheety lacing. Nose is salty, briny, loads of that heavy phenol that plagues the normal 3F Oude Kriek and Schaarbekse Kriek. Band-aid phenols blend with hefty green olive brine in the nose. Theres really no way to get around it. The taste is salty, dusty, moderate cardboard, flashes of intense lactic acid. Camphor medicinal numbing sensation on the tongue. Pairing with some intense food, the palate cleans up to something fruit juicy and slightly tannic like pinot noir. Clean lactic bite. But as FlacoAlto and biggirlpanties said it overall comes across too much like fruit juice. Nose finally dumps the band-aid phenols but it takes a solid 30-40 minutes. Juicy fruit medley in its place. Long, exaggerated tannins in the finish create a slate/chalk dry and tastebud puckering sensation.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

The flavor profile is tart initial; more lemon zest and grassy hops, moving to souring cherry pits and juice, with more funk and dry notes, while revealing peppery spicing, and finally moving to a simple puckering sourness and it is then that I found that this one was simply fantastic.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
4435,"2013-09-12",3.8,"Bottle with thanks to MrHangover! Pours deep clear ruby red with minimal head and little lacing. Aroma is lightly tart and fruity, strong cherries, just a bit of barnyard.

A - Pours a clear deep red/violet color with a fingers worth of off-white foam. Disappears quickly leaving behind nothing at all. Minimal lacing but really not a whole lot going on...it just looks like a glass of red wine.

S - Juicy cherries, oak, and vinegar. Some off smelling acid and cinnamon rounds it out but it is missing that stereotypical 3F funk. Really great cherry notes though.

T - Tart cherry juice, oak, and lactic acid. Some tonic water aftertaste. Very unimpressive while cold but letting it warm up improves it slightly. Really just one dimensional. A little bit prickly, but its pretty much dead flat which doesnt help with the flavors.

O - Expensive, flat, and sort of boring. This was just not very good. The aroma is nice but this is a serious downgrade over the standard Oude Kriek.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Flavor has a hint of sweetness but that quickly recedes. The juiciness is very prevalent and needs time to become more balanced; mid palate all you get is juice. The finish has light acidity and funk but this beer is dominated by cherry juice. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.

Some funk in the back as well. Flavor brings sour cherries immediately followed by some cherry pie. Toward the back of the palate I get some lemons. The cherry flavors here are totally different than in traditional krieks. When I get more of the sweetness, Im reminded of New Glarus Belgian Red. Its sort of a weird mix here and Im not sure how I feel about it. Mouthfeel is spritzy and drying. Finish is mostly tart and bracing. Get some of that typical 3F pepperiness from the yeast there too. I think Im going to wait a while before I open my next bottle of this one.

The nose is really huge and intense cherry fruit, so much so that in a way it seems to cover up and obscure the funky dryness that the regular Oude Kriek shows off so well. The flavor is much the same, theres so much cherry juice flavor in here that it almost makes the beer taste sweet/tart instead of dry, woody, and funky like the standard Kriek. I wanted to like this so much, but this is one of those cases where more does not mean better for me. Fairly heavy and thick for a Lambic, with lingering sour cherry tartness.

4435,"2013-05-14",3.1,"A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a 1 finger thick, dark pink stained head. The beer is a concentrated red / purple color that shows a hazed, rich red color when held up to the light. The aroma smells tart and cherry like up front, but then the cherry notes get more complex with carnation overtones, amply tannic cherry skins, hints of childrens aspirin, and just a rich, berry / cherry fruitiness. This smells mostly like rich, tart cherry juice that has been watered down just a bit, and I dont really get any sense of the base beer.

Fairly dry, somewhat tart up front with a thin cherry juice flavor up front. Tannic cherry skin notes, a bit of bitter cherry stone / skin notes and a concentrated floral character (carnations and a bit of rose) are found in the finish. The beer is fairly light bodied, it has a prickly carbonation to it and does have some tannic structure and body to it, but it still somehow comes off as being just a touch too thin. There are some light phenolic notes in the finish that accentuate and meld with the floral cherry character.

This was actually quite disappointing, considering it is coming from 3 Fonteinen. It tastes more like watered down cherry juice than anything; it is clear that it was made from high quality, complex cherries, but that doesnt hide the fact that the base beer really doesnt contribute to anything here. This doesnt even have the cherry richness that the Schaerbeekse Kriek, or Lou Pepe Kriek has, and the body is just a bit too thin. Ill have to try another of these after it has had more than a week to sediment out, but I dont know that will make a big difference; perhaps some age will help this beer do justice, but this is definitely the bottom of the lineup that I have had from 3F.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

PALATE: First are the slight sourness and acidity, next the round slighly funk texture, and in the end it is quite dry and acidic. 

TASTE: Cherries all over the place; Cherries, yeah, definitely cherries, and some krieken as well.

OVERALL: A great beer, as says the leaflet a great appetiser with which I would agree, even if topped with some dry champagne (what one tends to do around Brussels - they called it a ""half en half"", referring to 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 = half of lambic beer (geuze/fruit lambic) + half of champagne - a delight!","Linden, BELGIUM","gEUS"

4435,"2013-04-26",4.3,"22/IV/13 - 37.5cl bottle @ The Great Belgian Beer Dinner (Antwerpen) - BB: 13/XI/17 - bottled: 13/XI/12 (2013-377) 
Clear deep ruby red beer, big irregular dark pink head, bit stable, little adhesive. Aroma: lots of ripe cherries, bit earthy, more cherries, marzipan, bit of chloride, wood, pie dough, sweet touch. MF: soft carbon, medium to full body. Taste: very intense cherry flavour, little bitter, some chloride, bit lemony, bitter touch, almonds, citrus, earthy. Aftertaste: more ripe cherries, chloride again, sour, pretty dry, bit of marzipan. A very nice kriek, why yes! Btw: 40% cherries, does not mean 400gr per liter lambic, because you have to add the cherries to the total amount of volume. So with 400gr you would get 400/1400 = 28%. If it is really 40% cherries, that means that they must have use 666 grams of cherries per liter of lambic that they added to it. Which is a LOT of cherries....","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
4435,"2013-04-25",3.9,"Bottle from 3F, consumed at TdG 13. The pours deep purple with a small head. Looks like pureed beets. The nose is very intense cherries and raspberries. Concentrated sweetness. Rich meaty fruits. The taste is more of the same. Rich cherry pie filling, rhubarb. Thick fruit smoothie. Hints of balsamic on the finish. Good sweet/sour balance. Full body, fine carbonation. Overall, quite refreshing. A very different beer than the oude kriek, for example. Easy-drinking stuff.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4435,"2013-04-25",2.6,"rather dissapointing... started out nice: indeed an intense red beer. aroma: sweet, very much cherry, hints of lambic present in background but nothing much. taste: sweet, not really cloying, but rather close. 
this beer is not worth the extra cost (6 euro a bottle at the brewery) and I dare say that should it be the new Oude Kriek by De troch (or so) it would get burned. it is the most mediocre 3fonteinen lambic that I have ever tasted...","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","rotjoch"
4435,"2013-04-23",4.8,"375 ml. corked and caged bottle purchased @ the brewery during Tour de Geuze. Consumed home. Not a fan of the label which is a bit of a downer, commercial and out of place looking much like the flier I got for this beer. Drinking this right now because with so much cherries in it, I thought it was best to get this super fresh in order to enjoy all of the fruits. Although this was bottled on 13/11/2012. Pours intense red (sorry), darkest wine red imaginable, blood red Bordeaux, incredible very dark pink, hint rhubarb head, which very sadly fizzes away almost instantly. Nose incredibly pure and heavy kriek, almost juice-like, Oh my God so much, like pie almost, like pits, so, so, so, so much, much, much, much pure kriek, unbelievable. Taste is almost kriek juice, pure kriek, this is like eating a bag of kriek, light tart kriek juice in the finish, light hint juice, almost hint spices, light tartness in the finish, almost hint acid, so much juice, actual kriek sourness, like pie. Carb. is instantly gone, almost flat. I cannot believe this beer, so much fruit, ridiculous. REDICULOUS. Beyond drinkable, I could drink this all day long. Probably has the potential of becoming incredibly sour with age but that is not the point I assume. This is THE fruit beer, I have been looking for my whole life, only fruit in a glass. This is Kriek  mind you this is KRIEK and not Cherry which are extremely different things  dont call Krieks cherries  they are sour cherries. Prunus cerasus.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
4435,"2013-04-23",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2013 Bottle courtesy of Kraddel @ Post Toer de Geuze tasting.
Couleur est en effet intense, avec un acajou-bordeaux foncé, col est léger blanc-rosâtre.
Arôme est ici de griottes type noires au bouquet intense sur un boisé très agréable qui donne un bouquet fin épicé et fruité.
Palais est comme décrit, intense au niveau du fruité avec pas mal de griottes acidulées qui  se trouvent en dominance. Lajout aussi, selon moi, dun lambic jeune qui procure une certaine rondeur au palais et obscure un peu un côté plus acidulé. Griotte est parfaite, presque un peu trop présente, donnant ce côté confiture tout en gardant un fini léger en aigreur fruitée.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Head: pink , foamy 
Colour: deep intense red ( sorry couldnt resist it ) 
Smell: lots of cherries, mild sourness 
Taste: huge amount of cherries that create a natural sweetness in the Lambic , wich i think is great with all those artificially sweetned lambic out there ! also a very slight note of almunds ( probabbly created by the pits ), dry sour taste, very good !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","BelgBeerGeek"
4435,"2013-04-22",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2013 37,5cl bottle at Tour de Geuze 2013. Shared with Mathieu87.
Appearance: red beer (more dark red than regular Kriek), nice stable red foam. The beer looks so red it reminded me of blood.
Nose: Sourness, red fruits, mostly cherries noticeable, very sweet and full of aromas.
Taste: very sweet, only a little sour...In my opinion its to sweet at the moment for a sour Kriek. But give it time, it will become a very dense, complex and amazing brew! But now it didnt amaze me...

4435,"2013-04-22",4.4,"Bottle @ Kraddel TdG 2013 tasting. Intense red is a good description, its deep slightly pink-red with a medium pink head. Aroma is deep cherry sweet sour-ish tones with hints of dark fruits and barnyard funk. Taste is tart, sour-funky deep cherry tones with lemon, hay and deep red fruit tones. Super fresh and still dense in flavor. High carbonation and light to medium body. Really good stuff from 3F.

4435,"2013-04-22",4.2,"Bottle from the source, to start off the kraddel 21st birthday tasting. Color is exactly what the name says. Aroma is even more deeply intense cherries. Taste starts with a very soft sourness, then builds to pure fruit, then slightly dusty fruit, then subtle funk at the finish. Very tasty. Ill also let some bottles sit for a while and see what happens.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
4435,"2013-04-21",4.4,"Dark ruby red colour, slight reddish pink head. Aroma of cherries, lots of cherries. Marzipan, burgundy wine, pinot noir.Touch of vanilla and cloves. Light sweet flavour, fruity cherry, light sour touch. Light carbonation. Light astringent finish, cherry, light wood. Lingering red wine notes.
First sips were quite allright, but the more I drink it, the more I love it. This is like what Id imagine would happen if a big bulky pinot noir Bourgogne would get love babies with a cute innocent cherry lambic. Great stuff.
