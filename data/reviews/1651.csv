1651,"2013-12-15",3.8,"Bottled, 500ml from Booths in Kendal, Cumbria. Black with big tan head. This is more like it, lots of coffee husk and bitter chocolate notes, heavily roasted malts, drying but not over dry. There is a light nuttiness, almost an almond flavour giving some contrast. Deep and warming, a comfort blanket of a beer. Very good.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"

Full, soft condition; notes of biiter chocolate, iodine, stewed stone fruits and prunes. Fruity, lactic aroma wafting with an assortment of olfactory goodies including vanilla pod, carob, burnt malt loaf, raisiny high cocoa bitter chocolate and dark berries. Not especially dry. Lingers with roasted nut and mocha tones. A fine, full-bodied and satisfying stout Im throwing down like cocoa...","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

1651,"2012-12-01",3.8,"500ml bottle. Black with a brown head and some lacing. Theres a powerful roasty, ashy and chocolatey aroma out of the bottle, and more of a vanilla and custard nose once its in the glass. My mouth was primed for sweetness but of course its actually very dry, which seemed to take a way a lot from the taste. But, hey, it does what it sets out to do. This is a well-balanced and drinkable dry stout that deserves more exposure.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"
1651,"2012-03-03",4.1,"500ml bottle, Coppers, Ncl. Heady licquorice and coffee aromas immediately, chocolate flavours come in pretty quickly and mingle with the strong roasted malt taste. This is a great stout, yes there is some dryness, but I think its really well balanced and a great example of some of the fine beers coming out of Cumbria.","Carlisle, Cumbria, ENGLAND","RichardW"

Fairly smooth bodied, but perhaps a little lacking on texture that a bit of extra malt could pack in.
