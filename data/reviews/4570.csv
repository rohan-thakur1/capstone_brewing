4570,"2015-04-09",3.0,"Comparing this one to Hitachino White (HW), which I had just a few days ago. Aroma: Calabaza Blanca (CB) starts out with a more yeast-forward aroma- lots of sweet gum and also a healthy dash of coriander. Theres an orange peel presence that is not negligible. Appearance: Slightly cloudy pale yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around. Flavor: Mostly matches the nose; gum and coriander spiciness up front; orange peel becomes more apparent toward the finish, which dries up a bit. Palate: Full body, sticky texture, lively carbonation, long finish. Overall: Really the other end of the spectrum from HW; whereas that beer is more lemony tart yet wheat forward, this beer comparably is much more yeast and spice centric. HW finishes pleasantly dry, while CB has a lingering sweetness. Id take HW every time. Had both beers on tap (one at Gralehaus, one at Louisville Beer Store).","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

Some apple, lemon and orange peel, a bit dusty and almost mineral with a bit of yeast. Slightly woody and dry and bitter in to the finish and lingering after, quite herbal and floral, and lightly spicy. A tartness lingers around the corner of the mouth and citrus peels persist a bit til the end. Bit of stone in the aftertaste. Light body with a fairly aggressive carb of big, effervescent bubbles. Definitely not your run of the mill wit, twisted a bit with the JB lightly sour/tart/funky/woody character. A little light as their beers seem to be.

When I say explosive head, I mean it. Straight out of the cellar, no agitation at all, gently opened and immediately overflowed. Have a bucket ready. Sustained carbonation, tartness, and apple tones in the finish invite obvious cider comparisons. Unlike any witbier Ive ever had: only the mildest of wheat flavour fades in comparison to the barnyard funk and green apple tartness. After struggling for a bit for comparisons, Ill amend my comment: unlike pretty much any other beer Ive ever had - though the De Ranke XX Bitter or Cuvée de Ranke might be close. If anything, its more like a light, sour saison. Id like to vertical this new and following a years cellaring, to see how much of the funk and carbonation is due to ageing, and what its like new.

Lots of gentle lemon peel sourness. It really tastes more like a light, bright sour than a witbier. JP funkiness throughout. Lots of depth. Earthy and fruity background. The finish features a dry oak flavor and more of the spicing than showed up in the aroma. The coriander still seems pretty reserved but the orange peel makes its presence felt. Just gentle waves of lemon on top of a dried out wheat blanket. Pucker is mild but still more than youll find in any witbier. Relatively low carbonation.

Spiced with orange peel and coriander, and utilizing wild yeast strains (Brett) its delivery is refreshingly tart and spicey with a wonderfully dry finish. This brewery produces some of the best bottle conditioned beers anywhere. All their beers are aged in oak barrels with wild yeasts giving a subtle, pleasant acidity not unlike tart fruits. After oak maturation these beers are, re-yeasted upon bottling allowing additional time to develop natural carbonation in the bottle and further enhance complex flavor refinement in the finished beer. Because of this you must learn to gently handle the opening and pouring of bottle conditioned beers  to avoid the foaming volcano effect.

I had this on draft at Pizza Paradiso in DC over on Dupont Circle.

Ar: Very unusual. Smells of pears, orange, coriander, sweet tarts, and pepper.

T: Even more unusual! VERY peppery, with tons of orange. The pepper cuts into the citrus and the two dont go very well together in this setting. Perhaps its because the carbonation is almost non-existent? Also, I could use more tartness overall. It tastes like diluted orange juice concentrate.

4570,"2012-10-06",3.7,"10/6/12. 750mL bottle from Grassroots. I was surprise to see I hadnt already rated this one. Here goes. Hazy orange pour with a big, fluffy off-white head at first that fades to a soapy ring and laces a touch. Nice tart, lightly sour, wood aged aroma with Brett, some vanilla, and hints of citrus. Much lighter flavor than expected, however, that shows light citrus, doughiness, a hint of tartness, and some wood and vanilla and a hint of metal.

Aroma: Spices upfront, I mostly detect coriander. Some lemon peel and flowers. Theres also the usual JP funky (barnyard and hay) but less prononced than their others beers. Nice complexity, I was expecting more intense though. 

Taste: The lemon tartness is the main flavor. It makes it intense and refreshing while the yeasty notes round this one up nicely. I could also feel some bitterness (grapefruit skin) and sweetness (fieldberries).  
So well balanced. I didnt taste any oak though. 

Palate: Sprizty carbonation, champgne-like, makes it perfectly suitable for the style. The body is a little fuller than Id like though.

Probably the best witbeer Ive had. Balanced, complex, intense and refreshing. A little less acidic than the other JP Ive tried, which is a good thing.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

4570,"2009-08-06",2.9,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2014 this beer had the common denominator-tart funkiness-that ive come to expect from a JP brew, but thats where the accolades end.  this was actually my first disappointment from them, a thoroughly one dimensional beer.  all funky tart, and virtually no wit character to speak of.  it may as well have been an artisan lager...none of the 3 of us tasting could have told it was supposed to be a wit had the label not said.  not a bad beer in any way, but im surprised its rated so high within the style.  maybe there is consistency issues, but the one we drank had a barely detectable (only when the thin sediment was poured) coriander/orange peel flavor, and none in the aroma.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

Batch 313:  This beer is underrated! (and I always underrate, but this one is a keeper!)  Pours a hazy light honey, leaving a white, medium dry head with fragile and shortliving lacing.  The aroma immediately identifies itself as Witbier, bitter, sugary, citrus fruits poking you in the nostrils.  The taste reveals more lemons than I expected, but nicely balanced with the spices and sugars, cleaned up evenly with the medium carbonation.  A very refreshing, clean and defrickinlicious brew!","Brooklyn, New York, USA","CUJO"

Never the less...This beer was amazing.  My first of the Jolly Pumpkin ales, and I am so excited that I bought four more bottles at the brewery.  I got this on tap and it came to the table with virtually no head at all but it was a nice hazy yellow color.  Aroma was all there, and the flavor was amazing!  A bit sour, and certainly not what I expect from a Belgian white.  Awesome craft beverage!","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","MereLikesBeer"

It poured a hazy light yellow, with no head, but it seemed the bartender was at fault. The aroma was subtle, but the flavor was far from it. It was nice and slightly sour, with a great finish. Cheers to Ron and everyone at Jolly Pumpkin for the friendly words, and very well crafted ales!","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","BeerBaron617"
4570,"2009-06-18",3.8,"Tap @ Spuyten Duyvil - what a great beer this was.  Pours a cloudy straw color with a fluffy white head that left plenty of lacing on the inside of the glass.  The aroma is citrus, coriander, clove, and a bit of Belgian yeast.  Aroma is the same, with the citrus and spices melding together to form a sublime and surprisingly complex drinking experience.

4570,"2009-06-11",4.3,"750 mL bottle from Sams Quik Shop (Batch 285; brewed 2/29/08, to oak 3/5/08, bottled 4/2/08).  VERY carbonated and this one did gush just a bit (but not nearly as much as the 3 bottles of Oro de Calabaza Ive had).  Light, pale yellow in color with a very fluffy white head.  The swirl at the end of the bottle finally gives this the cloudy, Witbier look.  Pleasant, citrusy sour aroma.  Even with Jolly Pumpkin the sourness was a great surprise.  After the aroma the fact that this has a tart taste is no longer a surprise but it is very welcome.  The finish is clean and refreshing.  I think this is totally misclassified as a Witbier but as a beer it is fantastic.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"
4570,"2009-06-03",4.2,"Batch 279.

Appearance: Pours out a cloudy, straw-colored body with a frothy, tall, white head.

Smell: Pleasant mixture of tangy wheat with tart-scented fruits, earthy, freshly-ground spices, piquant oak, and some punchy lactic notes.

Taste: Soft white wheat with a scant, brief honey-like sweetness. Tart fruity flavors of pears, white peaches, and, lastly, some tastes of sweet and bitter orange peel. Then, in comes the spice hints of coriander and powdered ginger. Relatively smooth, but still slightly puckering oak wood hints. Theres sort of a ubiquitous lactic sourness throughout. Finishes rather dry with lingering, lasting touches of oak, spice, and tartness.

Mouthfeel: Its just a hair under medium-bodied. Well carbonated, no question there, and quite bubbly from beginning to end.

Drinkability: To help ""set the mood"" for this beer, I stepped out into the unpleasant, grotesquely humid, hot Atlanta weather for a few minutes. Though it ultimately lacked the body and creaminess of some witbiers, I felt it excelled surprisingly well in terms of both refreshment and enjoyment (at least with Batch 279). With some beers, clearing through a mere twelve ounces is a chore, but finding the end of this 750ml was a breeze!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Light straw color. Big yeasty smell, quite sour, some nice funk. This is definitely pushing the farmhouse flavors. Nice funkiness, and that same one of a kind taste that Jolly Pumpkin has. This tastes to me like ""Jolly Pumpkin,"" meaning all their beers have the same underlying flavor, and with this one not as strong with the other malty or hoppy flavors, that house character shines.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","DukeBrewDevil"

Very light-bodied but still quite firm. Tastes a lot like wheat, but none of the other classic witbier flavours at all - not that they are needed.

4570,"2009-01-21",3.1,"Crystal clear coloured light amber colour with a bright orange glow. Thin white head tops the beer, but the colour speaks for itself. Aroma of wheat, yeast, curacao and a light fruity scent. Pretty nice for the style, but missing a few large whiffs. Medium-bodied; Mild taste throughout - coriander seed and lots of it, very strong up front. Following soon behind with some nutmeg and wheatie characteristics - the yeast is somewhat noticeable. Aftertaste is light and airy - only some of the malt is noticeable, none of the hops and none of the sweetness. Overall, a good attempt at the style - I thought this was better from the appearance & aroma than it actually was. However, all-said, I would recommend people trying this beer.

Cloudy light golden amber color with a lasting, fine head and a dusting of sediment.

Lightly acidic, thin and relatively low in effervescence with a light body as well.

Aroma is full of wheat, orange, funk (a bit too much, or else something had gone slightly wrong) and feet...not much spice to speak of.  The flavor was much better than the aroma...lots of citrus (tons of lemon, and some orange), wheat, yeast, and a nice acidic funk to back things up.  Any spice, including coriander, takes a backseat in this brew, as it doesnt stand out as it does in most Wits.  Good on the palate...finishes very dry (would compare to a white wine) and keeps you coming back for more.  I would pick this one up again, despite the odd aroma, so I would say this is a pretty good beer, though definitely off the beaten path for the style.","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
4570,"2008-05-04",3.7,"Whats this?  A commonly available JP beer I havent rated?  Well, better late than never - hazy golden, fizzy beer, with a quickly dissipating head - the aroma has the standard JP funkiness to it, that seems to overpower the more subtle nuances (no big deal, though, since I enjoy their yeast), but some of the spices come through a little bit - tingly carbonation in the mouth - the light tartness and earthy funk that is common to their beers doesnt overpower in the flavor like it does in some others - there is a nice combination and lemon/citrus acidity, soft wheaty flavors, and light leathery funk - the spicy character the style usually brings is not very present, but the lively, crisp tartness that replaces it makes up for it, and makes the beer more like a berliner weisse than a wit - not their best offering, but a nice refreshing brew.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

4570,"2008-04-26",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2012 750ml from Sams, Durham. Funky butt? Funky wit!!! Now this is what Im talking about. Way to take a pretty meh style - at least as far as the usual offerings, either too watery or too cloyingly sweet - and give some depth and serious quirkiness without compromising style. A gorgeous pour with a big silky head, the aroma is suggestive to say the least. Sure the usual ingredients (listed in the commercial description) are there, but you get a nice funk element in there - not JP barnyard dank but a blend of dry brett  and over the hill melon/orange. Theres slightly more sharpness in the taste, but the funky elements are the strongest, and I think thats a very good thing.

Recieved this bottle from my RB Secret Santa, thanks Melvin. Calabaza Blanca turned out to be yet another Jolly Pumpkin gusher. Pours an opaque, hazy straw golden. Streams of carbonation chase each other to the small crown of white head that formed on the pour. Leaves a patch of lace here and there.

Smell has a little bit of that dusty funkiness to it. A solid dose of tangy wheat shows itself below the dustiness. Not much in the way of orange peel but there is a pinch of coriander. The aroma, unfortunately, doesnt stand out much.

Flavor follows the nose. Some wheat twang and a little of the funkiness but all characteristics seem really dumbed down. Not a lot of complexity or flavor. Im usually not a big fan of wits the way it is but this one leaves things to be desired.

The mouthfeel is pretty average. The problem is there is too much carbonation which makes this beer move through entirely too fast. Very prickly but no body with the high carbonation.

This beer goes down about like an ice cold macro. Non-offensive and easy to drink but not something I wouldnt waste my time drinking more than one.

Ive always passed by this beer because Im usually not in the mood for a wit. Now that Ive had the opportunity to give it a try Im glad I have passed it by. There are much better wits out there and for much better prices. Calabaza Blanca is a chink in Jolly Pumpkins armor.

4570,"2008-01-11",3.4,"Pours a cloudy, glowing yellow-gold body with a small, fizzy white head.  The foam eventually settles to a patchy film, leaving minimal spotty lacing in its wake.

The flavor is again light and crisp, with dry, lightly sweetened lemon, coriander, and mild JP funk comprising the bulk of things.  Light bodied, though substantial enough for the style.

Pours surprisingly clear (until the gunk on the bottom is poured in), golden with a very active fluffy white head.  Looks like champagne.  Aroma is surprisingly subdued and mild.  I thought a lot more funk would be present.  Light biscuitiness, a little tartness, no spices.  Some wheat and clove but barely.  No funkiness in sight.  Taste is thin, tart, light bodied, tingly.  Very dry.  Lots of carbonation.  This is all right but not one of Jolly Pumpkins better beers.

750 ml bottle purchased at Lukas in Kansas City, Missouri. Batch 285 sticker on back of bottle (Brewed: 2/29/08, To Oak: 3/05/08, Bottled: 4/02/08). Pour is hazed darker yellow with some floaties. Two inch white head is fizzy and noisy, with visible carbonation. Patchy lacing. Aroma of citric lemon tart and sour. Nice wheat body element, slight spicy yeastiness. Nice bright nose. Taste is bright citric wheat, prickly tart - puckering sour orange, lemon and limes. Nice fresh earthiness behind that. The funky JP yeast is present in the finish, adding complexity.

750ml bottle from Beertopia in Omaha, NE. Pour is clear golden with a ton of carbonation bubbles. A big fluffy white head of 3 inches settles down to about 1/2 inch and remains. Aroma of citrus, wheat, yeast, Belgian sugar sweetness, and only a hint of sour funk. Taste is more pronounced with the barnyard sour funk, though it is nicely blended with the lemon citrus freshness, and beautifully constructed palate. Crazy drinkable.

Jolly Pumpkins is an extraordinary execution of this style. Other brewers have tended more toward the sweet side of the flavor spectrum or worse--avoided flavor altogether to produce a beer that looks better than it tastes. Not so with the Calabaza Blanca! Its crazy combination of flavors makes this a beer to come back to. Delicious and nutritious. According to Eastern medicine, all five flavors should be present in every healthy meal--and apparently it works for beer too....OK I came back to it at the Whole Foods taproom in Santa Rosa.

4570,"2007-10-13",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2008 10/13/2007:  Jolly Pumpkin Calabaza Blanca pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a moderate amount of carbonation.  The white head is quite large and shapely with stiff peaks (reminds me of whipped egg whites).  It lasts from the initial pour all the way through the last sip and leaves foamy lacing on the glass.  The aroma is a bit sour with some woodiness present.  It is very inviting.  At first the sourness of the Brett and the dry oaky flavor from the barrel jump out, but then the yummy funkiness melds into the other flavors with each subsequent taste.  Some of the delicate underlying citrus and spicy qualities of the Wit beer can then be found.  The coriander complements the tartness nicely and really cuts through as the beer warms up some.  This beer has a medium-light body and is lively on the palate.  This is a really good and unique White Ale.  Jolly Pumpkin makes great beer and even though the 750 mL bottles are cool, I hope that they start to offer their other beers in 12 ounce bottles like this one...

______________________________

5/27/2008:  Calabaza Blanca Artisan White Ale has a hazy/cloudy pale golden color.  There is a high level of carbonation that crates a large, pillowing, and completely lasting white to off-white head.  The aroma is lightly fruity and tart.  A lemony acidity combines with some delicate apple, pear, spice, and yeast.  The flavor is a little tart like citrus/lemon pithe and slightly sour and funky.  It is really quite refreshing and exciting on the palate.  The spice is very subtle and the finish as somewhat dry.  The beer is light and crisp on the palate and has a smooth texture.  This is such a great beer and perfect for both who are interesting in adventuring into the world of sour beers as it is a good cross-over/starter beer for that!  I think I prefe this older, lower alcohol version in the larger bottle over the newer, stronger version in the 12 ounce bottles.  It seems to be more balanced...

Some of the ever present barnyardy aromas and wheat malt is moderately present.  Orange and coriander seem to be a bit weak, but this bottle, although refrigerated since being in my posession for the last 3 months, it could be much older.  Well balanced hop/malt wise, and even though a bit aged, it has a nice refreshing tartness to it that not many wits outside Belgium seem to have.

No real orange but the coriander is definitely present.  Soft lemony flavour with a touch of wheaty spice.  Light yeasty spiciness as well.

4570,"2007-07-17",3.1,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2009 NorCal tasting July 07 - I could seriously get into this beer. It has all the nice character that I like in my wits, plus it brings the funk which is always nice. A sharp lemony, orangy sweet aroma, lightly spicy with subtle corriander hints. Appearance was a pale, pale yellow, cloudy with a smaller sized white head. Brett played a big time role in the flavor of this beer, orange notes, lemongrass, a bit dusty with a dry finish. It almost had some wine-like character to this beer. I definitely recommend this beer as it is really beer apart. On a side note, excellent labels from JP.

OK, this bottle was not quite as good as my first one, which was some time ago.  This had almost no wit character at all, flat on the front end of things (flavor wise, not carbonation) with a high degree of funkiness.  Missing were any semblance of fruit.  Seemed like a mini-gueuze at times.  Still, enjoyable as it was I didnt enjoy it nearly as much as I did the first time.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
4570,"2007-07-14",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2008 Cloudy white gold appearance.  Lovely and unique nose sensations.  Autumn leaves, balsamic vinegar, and that unmistakable j/p apple tartness.  Further notes of sourdough and a bit of salt.  Coriander, cayenne, white pepper and partially reduced pears on the tongue.  Spicy, lively, and a little crazy.  Finishes on a dry desert shrub sensation.  Palate is strawlike - taut, earthy.  A different and interesting take on the style that is far more pleasing than plain yeast and sugar.  Simply lovely.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

4570,"2007-07-05",3.5,"Hazy, ugly, but quite luminous yellow pour with white light cast forth. A tall white, rocky head is very well retained and leaves thick webs of lacing behind, eventually. Spice dominates the nose in the form of notes of pepper, yeast and crisp, unripened citrus. Quickly following are aromas of oak, vanilla, tangerine and sweet mandarin nectar, alcohol that really shouldnt be noticeable at such a low strength. Banana and wheat notes round out the nose. The flavor is incredibly spicy and peppery, with yeast spiraling forward like a stormcloud. Bitterness is mild, acidity is moderate, sweetness medium. Finishes very dry, yeasty and spicy. the mouthfeel is light, crisp, gritty and lively due to robust carbonation and engrossing tannins. A pretty wild witbier.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The flavor is musty earthy yeast with some peppery spices and some tart and slightly sour citrus.  The mouthfeel is is medium with a ton of sharp carbonation.

4570,"2007-06-15",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2010 Almost clear yellow body with a small white head.  For a witbier the nose is very funky, like someone poured some gueuze in a classic witbier.  First impression when drinking it is that it reminds me of their wonderful Bam Biere.  Similar intense fruity tartness and sourness but without the support of the Bam Biere body.  Very lemony, pineapples and all kind of tropical fruits, dry orange peels, many spices including the classic coriander, even some dandelions.  So far so good, so far so very good actually.  But it gets better.   Next comes a woody/barrel character that leads to a dry finish and this is what makes it stand out.  A the beer warms-up the woody/barrel flavours begin to take over the fruity notes.  Oily body with a medium-soft carbonation.  Very flavourful and complex by witbier standards.  The only problem with the beer is the similarities with the superior Bam Biere. A 750ml goes by more quickly than a 16 year-old backstage after a New Kids On The Block concert.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Surprisingly light tart orange and spice aroma.  Flavor is pleasantly tart, like other JP beers, but the tartness in this one seems to overwhelm the other subtle flavors of orange, spice, and wheat. These flavors seem a little more present as the beer warms up a bit. Body is light-medium as it should be, very slightly overcarbonated giving it a bite on the tongue in the finish.

750 ml bottle
Recent brewing, cleansed 05/07
Moderate pour in a mug.

Poured a hazy straw color with a huge rocky white head with fair lacing.

Smelt of strong fresh oranges and lemons, coriander, light bread and dough.

Taste was upfront strong sour orange and lemon juice with light to moderate bread notes followed by moderate sour oranges and lemon and bitter doughy yeast on an average finish.

Palate was light to medium bodied, lively carbonated, slightly dry on a dry finish, moderately puckering and slightly astringent.

Overall, this is a nice soft introduction to the sour beers of Jolly Pumpkin.  The people whom Ive shared this with, none of them being big craft beer drinkers, were very pleased with it.

Initially, tart and musty flavor leaving some light grass and a ""lemon squeeze"" on the finish.  Mellows out after some time, where some of the orange peel/coriander notes come through.

Pleasant aroma with a light tartness from the brett (without overwhelming the witbier profile underneath).  Champagne-like crispness and acidity in the mouthfeel: plenty of coriander, watery oranges, and dough, nicely brought alive by the brett character.  Light, doughy and citrus finish.

4570,"2007-01-15",3.7,"I hate wits, in general.  But I truly enjoyed this beer.  After a terrible day of $250 in books being stolen from my desk in the lab, I came home still miserably angry, but was talked into cracking one open.  Not wanting to waste the ""good stuff,"" I went to this interesting looking Belgian white.  Wow, not bad!  Its a clear pallid yellow without the yeast dumped in (the bottle is simply too big for me to get the yeast a glass at a time!).  The nose is tart and tangy with a light wheatiness about it, rather than that dominating grainy aroma.  Very tart, lemon, with a bit of creaminess.  Orange zest and some light spices present.  A bit of that Belgian and open fermentation twang.  This is a very nice beer indeed aroma-wise.  The palate is quite nice as well, creamy and full, though perhaps a bit fizzy.  The flavors are even bigger and louder than the subtle aromas would indicate.  Incredibly, ridiculously tart.  Lemon and that open fermentation yogurt twang stick out.  Theres a light sweetness, and a bit of yeast and orange, but a huge sour point.  Not balanced, but I dont mind!  Yeast takes off some of the edge, makign this perhaps a bit more drinkable for the unprepared, but I liked it better undampened.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
4570,"2007-01-15",3.7,"Golden yellow color with a medium white head.  Smells like orange, general citrus, malt and spices.  There is sourness in the flavor but also malty and sugary with some lemon.

4570,"2007-01-15",4.4,"With the yeast stirred up and poured in, the beer is a cloudy straw color, topped by about two inches of frothy white foam. Lots of carbonation stirs up some small dark flecks of yeast. Good head retention and spotty but thick lacing. Tangy wheat, lemon, and yeast are found in the aroma - very nice.

The beer is tangy, almost to the point of being funky, with full flavors of wheat and a lemony citrus character. The coriander is subtle but still noticeable. Dry wheat, orange, and coriander come out in the finish, and the tangyness sticks around in the aftertaste.

Nice aroma, not strong, but distinctive with lots of coriander, just a touch of orange peel, and maybe a hint of lemon - there was also a fresh dough note in the background.

4570,"2006-12-06",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2008 What a fine beer from a fine brewery.  Pours cloudy light orange with an enormous uneven sudsy white head.  The aroma has more coriander than most wits - offsetting it is smoothness from the wheat and a hint of orange.  Medium / light body that is very crisp with some very smooth carbonation complimenting the sharp biting taste.  The taste starts with sour yeast as many Jolly Pumpkins do, there is also a good amount of coriander and some citrus bite.  The finish has a ton of coriander and even more sharpness.  This comes across as a cross between a wit and biere de garde, which isnt surprising since this is from Jolly Pumpkin.  Excellent wit. <P>  Rerate notes:  The aroma has whats listed above, but also some notes from the barrel aging.  There is some dry orange in there, quite a bit of graininess and some oak.  While it is quite a bit more expensive than other wits, it is so unique and interesting that I dont feel ripped off.

4570,"2006-07-26",3.8,"12 oz bottle (sixth consumed of a six-pack), Bordeaux glass.  A giant, merangue-like foamy white head stands firmly on a light golden-amber body, cloudy from the addition of yeast.  Intoxicating waves of lemon, honey and graham cracker appear at first sniff.  Apricots, coriander, cloves and cracked pepper shortly follow.  Sour elements (reminds me of apple and banana baby foods) merge into a soft and well integrated oak note.  The aroma gives good indication of what the flavor will be like.  Starting creamy, softly acidic, fruity and buttery-oaky the front-end is nearly reminiscent of a California Chardonnay.  Mid-palate brings out a timid lemon sourness and leather and horseblanket funk.  The finish is tart and dry with strong grass, pepper and oak elements.  The mouthfeel is viscous enough to avoid watery, yet is soft enough to be palatable on a very hot day.  The explosive carbonation surely doesnt hurt in that regard, either.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Aroma of brettanomyces was overly dominant and left little space for the coriander and orange peel that were advertised on the label. Taste is also dominated by the brettanomyces with some hints of coriander and wheat. Body is definitely above average for the style and that made it pretty enjoyable.

Came out of the tap very foamy, but eventually settled down.  Hazy lemon meringue pie yellow with a bright white evervescent head.  Head lingered for quite awhile.  Good lacing throughout.  Flavor:  Tart lemon flavor followed by a bevy of spices (corinader, cloves, szechuan pepper).  A delicate malt sweetness was the foundation for all these other flavors.  Also detected notes of hay and grass.  Palate:  light to medium bodied.  Seemed a bit drier than many other witbiers Ive tried, which I enjoyed.  Carbonation was lively and prickly on the tongue.

Fear not, it does not four up the flavor of this beer.  Smells fruity, with a nice smell of oranges and some oak.  Taste is very similar, and very refreshing.

Flavor is a lemon juice and gin sour sweet flavor, with plenty of aged apple juice, bready wheat malt and copious spicy, sticky yeast notes. A faint glow of alcohol caresses a grainy smack.

Pours a hazy straw-gold with an ambitious white head. The aroma is sour yeasts and a bit of orange and candy-shop and hint of coconut and nutmeg. On the tongue, the beer is surprisingly sour and rustic, almost heading into saison territory. Lemon juice dominates the flavor early, spiced up by belgian witbeer yeasts and ginger and again the coconut with a nice and impressively bitter grassy-hop finish that only appears very late in the sip. The palate is sparkling and refreshing.

4570,"2006-03-12",2.8,"Pours a clear golden, with an extremely frothy head the entire time. I was holding on to this for a while thinking it may have been the best beligian white my favorite style beer I have ever had with all the hype on the brewer, but it definitely wasnt even close. Dominant flavors are coriander and orange peel the whole time, along with a slight lemony aftertaste and maybe a ever so slight hint of banana, other than that it leaves a very poor taste in your mouth that does not taste good at all, I dont hate it but know I will never buy this again at $7, very dissapointing.","Brook Park, Ohio, USA","crizay"

Refreshingly tart, orange, pineapple, corriander and cobwebs. Mouthfeel is light and lively. Dry finish. Not really true to style, but JP brews to their own style. The use of Brett, in my opinion, is much more interesting than the usual banana and clove of the Hoegaarden yeast. Also the spicing of this beer is just right, too many brewers over spicing their Wits. This was nice and refreshing. Another winner from JP.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"

Flavors are of Granny Smith apples right off the bat. Some Brettanomyces is also present, probably from the barrel aging. Lively on the tongue, spritely. Thin body & mouthfeel. Crisp flavors fade quickly off the tongue. A decent Witbier from JP.","","Cobra"

4570,"2006-02-08",4.0,"750ml Bottle thanks to Styles: Pours to a beautiful bright and pale yellow, mostly opaque even with held to the light, with an enormous frothy white head that lasts throughout the entire glass.  Very miniscule bubbles can be seen gently rising to the surface.  A touch of mild lemongrass and wheat rise to meet the nose, followed by citrus, coriander, fresh orange rind (almost unripened), a hint of pepper, musty hay-filled sack, light nutmeg, spices, and gentle wood.  The flavors unfold with a brief lemongrass, followed immediately by a slightly tart wheat and light citrus that is very refreshing to the palate.  The orange rind comes through towards the middle, and definitely more after a few successive sips, there may even be a slight hint of grapefruit rind here too.  The spicy yeast, coriander, and hints of pepper come out towards the end, but are quickly replaced by a quick retronasal hop note, then moderately dry wheat, and dusty hay at the finish.  Medium bodied, excellent natural carbonation, tiny, well-integrated bubbles tingle and create a filling but not heavy feeling.  It does seem to be just a bit on the tart side, and maybe a bit hoppy, with more oak (dry white wine-like barrel?) than Im used to tasting, but it is well-integrated into the whole beer.  Very nice.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

4570,"2006-02-04",3.6,"(750 ml bottle: Obtained in trade with Eyedrinkale, thanks Mike!) Big, frothy, white head takes quite some time to settle out, thanks in part to the army of carbonation bubbles that rise at break-neck speed to the surface.  But as it does settle, a thick, foamy curtain of lace coats the entire glass and shows exceptional longevity.  Lots of coriander and citrus in the nose.  Wheat, yeast, mild lemony citrus, coriander, gently bitter orange peel, all present and all wonderfully balanced.  Not really all that tart to me, but its not even mildly sweet.  Body is light-medium and carbonation is lively but not expansive.  With the spices, citrus and carbonation, this beer is very refreshing on the palate.  Bright golden yellow, only somewhat cloudy until the final pour when a significant amount of sediment finally flows into my glass.  Heading, retention and lacing remain visually stunning for the entire session, and Ive dragged this session out for nearly three hours (so the beer is certainly at room temperature).  A well-made witbier, certainly one of the more balanced American-made witbiers Ive sampled.  Nice job.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

I am rerating this primarily for my own reference, even though the original
   rating was not that bad.  Coming back to this reminds me why Jolly Pumpkin
   is a rising star in the beer world - as long as this is one of their average
   beers, they are among the best in the country.  Track it down if you can and
   you wont be disappointed.
Aroma / Appearance - Hints of orange peels, lemons, wheat, honey and
   hay wafted up into my eager nose in a nice balance.  The body itself was about
   the color of liquid mandarin oranges minus the pulp.  A one-finger head
   lingered briefly before being consumed by the body.  Overall, it was very
   inviting with no faults.
Flavor / Palate - A peppery carbonation is the immediate response to
   a first sip, followed by oranges, limes, wheat, vanilla and peaches.  A smooth
   buttery texture underlies everything ever so slightly as overall it reminds
   me of day old champagne.  The finish is clean, dry and leaves traces of orange
   on the throat.  An exceptionally well done Belgian from one of the finest
   producers of Belgian style beers in the US.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4570,"2005-11-26",4.0,"750ml bottle.This is the best witbier Ive had yet, though it defeats Lake Louie Prairie Moon for that title by a technicality: Prairie Moon is called a ""farmhous ale"" by the brewery and classified here as a saison even though it has all the characteristics of a witbier: light straw color, unfiltered yeast haze, coriander and orange peel. But I digress -- back to the Jolly Pumpkin.<P> Hazy light  straw-colored pour with a huge fluffy white head that grudgingly agrees to settle down to half an inch where it remains in perpetuity or until you drink the last drop, whichever comes first. Spectacular witbier aroma -- spicy hops, coriander, citrus/orange peel, and more spicy hops. Coriander takes center stage in the flavor, suppored by that big hop spice, light hop bitterness, orange peel, and light sugary malt.

The feeling proceeded to surge for a bit and then it seemed as if the carbonation had increased and the pleasure diminished to the point that I was almost getting bored with this.

Fizzy mouth feel, a bit heavier bodied than many whites, but it works well.  A very solid white.","Rochester, New York, USA","ElJefe"

Aroma was slightly vinegared and overall yeasty with banana, clove, green grapes and bread dough. Crisply tart with a lively presence in the mouth. Creamy & dry mouthfeel makes it almost ""fluffy"".  Slightly sour to finish with clove. Delicate yet multi-layered and terribly intriguing.

Pours a delicate pale gold with a light head that is more gas bubbles than froth. This takes many sips to get at flavor wise. Initially I thought I tasted faint bannana, but as I continued I decided it was just the effect fo the coriander and the malt and not quite the same as you would taste in say a german Hefe. There is a thinness to this that doesnt come until the final sip, but it tastes like spicy water at that final swallow and that loses points.

Mild mellow taste of lemon bread dough. Slightly spicy with breezings of herbal grasses, pepper, clove, and corriander. Light pale malt sweetness underneath. Moderately crisp and very easy going with mostly doughy lemon candy taking the front with the spices and light sweetness keeping to the edges. Nice but brief little sugary grab on the finish as the pale malt floats in with very soft and airy light drying.

Feel is light to medium body with a creamy crispness and doughy sweet center. Very pleasant carbonation thats mild and smooth. Not so much Witbier-like as it should be, but I like it none the less as its smoothness tends to favor my palate. Finish is intriguingly unique with its airy pale malt sweetness.

Pretty good stuff. A little out of the realm of most Witbiers, but likeable and damn drinkable all the same. At first I was skeptical, but its mild complexity grew on me.

The aroma has some wonderful notes of corriander, clove, white pepper, orange zest, wheat, slightly funky and earthy yeast esters. The taste didnt disappont either with a big spicy forefront with a nice moderate citric and wheaty backbone. Discovered some earthy and herbal notes through to the surprisely bone dry finish (due to the barrel aging?) and melon aftertaste and lingering pepper tones. The feel is very crisp and lively, perhaps a bit too much as it make it seem somewhat watery. The carbonation does keep this more akin to the refreshing nature of the style so Im not going to deduct a lot for this observation. Overall, this is one top-notch wit that is worthy of all praise.

4570,"2005-02-06",4.7,"Pours a hazy gold-orange color, it is topped by a frothy off white, creamy head that is held up by an ample carbonation.  The aroma is spicy with orange peel dominating, but there are notes of ginger, pepper, a hint of musty cobwebs, earthy coriander, and a bright citrus acidity.  The aroma is quite nice.

The beer is nice and light on the palate.  It starts with a citrusy orange character and finishes with a bright acidity, that moves to an herbal perhaps woody tannic note.  There is a nice light wheat character here that mixes well with the other refreshing components of this beer. This really is quite well done actually, at first it seems like a straight up Belgian Wit, but there are subtle notes of complexity here, and I do believe that there is perhaps a bit more acidity than is typical of the more simplistic Witbiers out there.  This beer has lots of good spiciness to it as well, I get notes of ginger, pepper, coriander.  I like that the coriander is used correctly in this beer, it is not too strong and the earthy-herbal note that is typical of overly-spiced versions is held nicely in check.

This is definitely one of the best Belgian Wits that I have had, I am a sucker for a good Wit, but I think that this has struck a really nice balance.  It is bright, citrusy, and quite refreshing, yet it has some subtle complexity to it, but not so much that it gets in the way of this beer being refreshing like it should.  Hopefully the barrels that this beer is aged in will be properly inoculated, because this could use a bit more funky complexity to it, that would definitely make this beer perfection in the glass come late spring to summer time.  This is by far the best beer from Jolly Pumpkin that I have had, This is in fact just a world class example of this style, and I hope this brewery can get their Barrels going such that all of their beers can get to this level.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The Festivities:Doughy yeast attempts to ground the frolicking spices but a fervent effervescence propulses them to orgiastic intensity. Lemonade soothes the tongue and orange zest palpates the palate. Dryness ensues, encouraged by the puffy carbonation.

4570,"2005-01-24",4.0,"Nice cloudy gold, rather dark for a white beer, gentle meringous head, sticking to the edges. Incredible spicy aroma, executed with grace. It seems so easy, this is troubling. Firm ginger roots, fresh ginseng, mellow coriander and a touch of lemon and vanilla combine into the most gracious offering. The closest one I can think of would be hitachinos, but more subtle and elegant. Like a spice mousse, fluffy. Unfortunately, the flavor doesnt quite hold up though its still far better than most contenders in the style. It is surprisingly bitter and has a sharp sour/vinous middle with rhubarb, ginger and cranberry notes. I dont find the same coherence than in the aroma, but this may be due to the agressive carbonation, full of big bubbles, which somehow detracts a bit. Nonetheless a stunning take on a witbier, world-class and beyond aroma.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Hazy yellow body is topped by a decent, fine-bubbled, white head that recedes to lasting cover.  Flavour is very fresh - like a spring garden or gazpatcho soup with a crisp, dry finish and fair bitterness.  Fair carbonation but heavy feeling in the mouth.  Bottle enjoyed with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.Rerate (8-3-7-2-14=3.4): Tangerine, coriander and ginger are prominent in the wheaty, dusty aroma.

Really drinkable, sweet and dry. I find the 12 oz bottle to be a bit more on the sour side with some lemon, more bret and less head retention.

Rating # 635
The White Pumpkin has a most beautiful appearance... its a pretty ""Squash."" The body is a glowing golden Calabaza with a fine-looking white cap of head. There is an intense sheet of finely compacted bubbles that lace the inner glass. The aroma puts forth a tart lemony and yeasty beady-ness. The flavor brings delicate notes of clove and coriander, but the citric lemony likeness and a hint of ginger are still in the forefront. This Witt has the traditional musty cracked wheat flavor that I find in most well made Belgian style Witbiers, it embraces that earthy, organic feeling. The palate brings a most amazing feeling of light effervescence all throughout my mouth; its light yet hearty viscosity is very refreshing! 
 In all Honestly, this is undoubtedly the most amazing Witt I have ever had! I do not know where or by whom the brewer at Jolly Pumpkin studied; but in my mind, he or she has created the most traditional and enjoyable Witt I have ever sampled and Im generally not a fan of this style!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
4570,"2004-11-29",4.2,"750 mL capped bottle, courtesy of the very generous Jeff (TAR) and Emily (cb): crystalline lemon gold body, it simply glows in the sunlightperfect white cream  dense, fluffy and retentive.  Strong hay presence in the aroma is wrapped by lemon zest, soft wheat, pine nuts, coriander and pale malt, complexly rich and amazing, dare I say: memorizing.  Brilliantly soft and tingly on the tongue, hundreds of tiny bubbles rushing in a smooth stream into all corners of the mouth.  There is a nice play of lively fizz and smooth, creamy carbonation.  Toasted coriander flavours blend elegantly with freshly cracked pepper, sourdough yeast and fresh wild flowers.  Wow, how gracious Jeff & EmilyThank you!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"

4570,"2004-11-29",3.9,"Another gift of Jeff and Emily.  Hazy, golden yellow with a sizable, fluffy, white head.  The aroma is pleasingly soft and subtle.  Banana, citrus zest, coriander, wheat bread, fruity esters from the yeast and a bit of white pepper.  The body is light and refreshing which makes for easy drinking.  The flavor is quite nice with a bit of sweetness of front before a light tart finish accompanied by the slightest hint of hops.  Tasty and enjoyable.  Something I would drink with regularity in the summer, if I could only it get it regularly.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
4570,"2004-11-26",3.6,"Cloudy yellow-orange body, thin off-white head.  Nose of coriander, banana, and orange peel.  Sharp body with little evidence of barrel aging at first, starting with banana, coriander, and wheat tang.  The finish is long and spicy; wood flavors also develop and leave a clean, dry mouthfeel.  To be honest I expected a bit more from this beer; as it stands, this is still a solid witbier, although I wish it was fuller-bodied and more complex.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

4570,"2004-09-09",4.3,"Dark hazy lemon. Quarter-inch beaming white foam with scattered rocky patches. Remarkably integrated aroma of coriander, white grapes, glazed pale malt, and peppery yeast. Rosehips, jellied orange peels, and extremely bright Hallertauer notes. Soft and fluffy carbonation.  Succulent body. Sweet pils malt structure is overlapped by plump orange pulp acidity. Touches of medicine and slightly astringent yeast coarsen the juicy body. Hops are deceptively juicy, throughout, acquiring a rich, yet tangy, lemon balm underlay. Doughy yeast coats the roof of the mouth, seemingly thickening the body, with waning pils malt and heightening coriander. Vague malt hull flavor comes in late alongside rosehips and some raw cane sugar grit. Moist ending, with assorted tropical fruits, floral hops, and doughy yeast elements. Astonishing complexity, but oh so refreshing. Superb!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4570,"2004-08-12",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2006 Rererate: Lacto sourness precludes getting to the original flavor, at least in the summer 2005 botlings which are now in OH, for example. Flavor and aroma downgrades...bummer! Rerate: several samplings later. Downgrade slightly in flavor. Original, August 2004. Bottled, purchased at the brewery from Ron Jeffries after a nice conversation. This is truly a fantastic wit, and a lucky and great choice for #50 of the style. I think this is the best American made witbier I have ever had, bar none. The misty nose straight from the bottledneck was such a clean hit of coriander the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Strong, acrid wheat malt melts into smooth orange and big spicy pepper and coriander in the nose. Looks perfectly luminescent golden, lit from within. Loads of yeast in the bottom, swirl vigorously to get it all in the last load of the snifter. All the elements are clearly distinguishable here, even the pepper and coriander flavor bursts - the tip of my tongue is still tingling. Oak aging has softened the flavors some, and the body is nearly as full as the best overseas wits (BFMs comes to mind). Delightful, and far better than expected given my like for, but not raving reviews of, the other Jolly Pumpkin ales.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

Aroma of oak, wet leather, yeast, coriander.  Flavor is toasty and oaky from the white oak aging, but some of the coriander and yeast breaks through and further dries out the palate.  There was a bittersweet finish, some hops and light malt (honey, white bread).  Didnt find much citrus (orange peel or lemon) in this one, but thats alright.
