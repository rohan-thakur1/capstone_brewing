4128,"2017-05-06",4.5,"Pour from a bottle when I picked up Madeline bottles. The piurnisna deep ruby, almost purple black, still, and carrying a heavy viscosity. The aroma is full of cherry. Its dry, yet juicy at the same time. The skins and flesh are prevalent with a sweet earthy honey undertone. Its got a light bit of alcohol on the end, but it works well. The flavor is great. There is a strong fruitiness up front with a light honey and then the cherry just pops. Its almost like a sweet thick juice. The mouth feel is thicker and syrupy like youd expect with a sweet and earthy honey with a light flashiness and hint of alcohol on the back end. This is really good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4128,"2016-11-11",4.4,"375 ml bottle, 14% ABV. Served in a snifter, the mead pours a dark red/purple color with pretty much no head at all. The mead smells like tart and sweet cherries and honey, kinda reminds me of cherry pie. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, its all cherries and honey. More sweet than tart, but not overpoweringly so. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its syrupy and slick with a low amount of carbonation. Really easy to drink, too. Not boozy at all, at least not for being 14% ABV. This is certainly one of the better meads Ive had. If Schramms doesnt send more to Ohio soon, I guess Ill have to make a trip to Michigan to buy more of their meads! Definitely worth picking this up if you come across a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

4128,"2014-06-15",4.3,"Bottle from umich03jm. Pours ruby red, substantial aroma of cherries and sweet mead. Flavor is big, bold, sweet, ripe cherries, and touch of tartness, sweet mead, and warming alcohol. Nothing thin here at all, and in no way simple, but not really complex. Although sweet, its not sugary. Like an elegant dessert. It completely works and is addictingly tasty. Flavor lingers on the palate. Pricey but worth it for special occasions.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
4128,"2014-05-04",4.2,"The aroma is floral, a wine smell. Pours a red burgandy. The taste is sweet. The body is light, the texture thin, the carbonation soft and the finish sweet. Overall Very Good!","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","LearninBeer"

Must get more of this delightful nectar.","Florida, USA","burg326"
4128,"2014-04-15",4.3,"Bottle shared during a mead tasting hosted by daknole. Gorgeous nose of decadent dark cherry, raspberry, light oak and vanilla. Pours a clear dark ruby red. The taste is beautifully layered with tart cherry, dry merlot, moderate oak, rich honey, and a vanilla whisper. Light body with a sticky sweet finish. Insanely good.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
4128,"2014-04-13",4.1,"Smells like very intense cherries. Taste is cherry, but it also had sort of a cough syrup sort of taste to me and it was definitely the booziest tasting of the three Schramms that I had (Raspberry, Blackberry, and The Statement). After I opened it and drank half, I recorked it and let it sit for a few days. After a few days, I found that it was actually much better than when I initially opened it and the booziness and cough syrup taste had gone down, although they were still there.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"

Honey surprisingly crowds out the cherry somewhat. The taste is rich honey comb. Accents of cherry skin. Lightly tart. Medium body, slick. Less precious than the other Schramms Ive tried. Still tasty though.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

The aroma offers up nectar sweet dark berries and then crazy berry goodness wow! Pretty rich aroma of berry goodness and whiffs of slick sweetness. The taste is similar with lovely nectar like berry richness and sweet smooth nearly silky modest honey backbone. This is sweet smooth goodness where a mild cherry tannin like tartness creates a crisper dryer finish. This isnt a big rich sweet sweet sipper but berry juice, some honey and a bit of berry tartness. Lovely statement.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

4128,"2013-10-26",3.9,"Bottle shared at Patty and Jays Mead Party. Thanks! Pours a rich deep crimson reddish ruby hue. No haze, a decent darkness in the middle with pinkish fruit punch hued edges and bottom. No head. Aromas are a deeper big cherry element, honey meets Balaton, tart and a bit darker, black cherry, touches of sweetness, dark, cherryskin, a bit slick. Some really rich elements here meet some honey, a touch sweet, big cherry presence, cherry juice, a faint waft of florals. Initial is a decent body, showing a richer cherry presence, touches of cherryskin is just a faint bit tannic, honey meets some tartness, black cherry nectar, some gentle sweetness. The middle sustains, mellow cherryskin meets deeper dark ripe cherries, a bit tart, sweeter honeywine, some earth, gentle fruit and sweetness hits. Backend is a bit more tannic, slick, gentle honey, apples meet cherries, some sweetness, faint grass and warmth as we move on. Finish is a bit slick, gentle cherry tartness and warmth, lingering sweetness, a touch of earth. The nose and front end of this one are hjust fantastic, rich and lush, as we taper into the backend where its a bit more manageable. Pretty nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
4128,"2013-10-25",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2014 Pours a very deep brilliant red purple. Aroma is pure cherry juice, so rich and deep. Flavor is whoa. I have tasted cherries straight from the tree that taste less like cherry. The flavor is very bold. Fresh cherry juice, tart with subtle waves of sweetness poking through. Its lightly earthy with a perfect harmony between sweet and tart. 

This is some epic stuff. Quite ""the statement"" indeed!","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
4128,"2013-10-11",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2015 Bottle: Ruby and purple tinted color, decent legging from this one. Aroma is great; some ripe cherry, apple hints, a touch of something that reminds me of cinnamon spice, and of course, a zesty honey sweetness. Taste is very thick, dense, & sweet without being abrasive or cloying. Light apples, some fresh cherry sweetness, honey, and some dry oak in the finish. Once again, an absolutely great mead from Ken!","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
