3726,"2012-09-18",3.5,"Bomber from Hayduke.  This beer was well filtered and clear brown.  It had a huge head on each of the 3 pours needed in my Perfect Pint.   The head was not only huge but was rocky and left layers of lacing.  The nose was soft with fruit, earth, and chocolate.  The flavor was malt forward but nothing here was really big.  Hops added fruit and bitterness was very mild.  This reminded me of a cross between and English bitter and a brown.  It had an authentic English feel to it.   I liked this beer and found it to be very easy to drink and tasty.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

Flavor is more hoppy than malty, almost like an IPA, somewhat bitter, with a grassy note and subtle hints of apple and caramel. Ragged texture has a fair amount of fizz and decent body. An interesting brew, to say the least.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

3726,"2012-03-11",3.8,"22 ounce bottle - $3.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours out a clear, amber-tan body with a frothed, beige head. Coating lace sheets on the descent.

Smell: Toasted biscuits, a very slight edge of roastiness, with some sweetish toffee hints, bits of dried herbs, spice, and aromatic dried tangerine peel.

Taste: Sweet, toffee-accented, lightly bready, toasty pale malts. Very low roasted tone. Herbal, spicy English hops, but the Amarillo gives a little, light grassy, orange hints and extra added bite. Medium-light bitterness. Drying finish with a lingering orange/tangerine citrus taste (particularly as it warms a tad).

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Though opting to use ingredients a little less than tradition, I still thought it was pleasant enough, serving well for an after-work beer. Hell, Ill take it over a snoozer like Smithwicks any damn day of the week.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

3726,"2011-06-22",3.5,"22oz bottle, purchased at Bottle Barn. (I remember really digging this beer on draft when Jeremy (brewer) was visiting TAPS Petaluma; didnt bother to rate the draft version at the time.) Pours a medium, amber-brown color with high clarity; creamy, fine-bubbled white head with modest retention and nice lacing. Aroma presents, seemingly, a whole bunch of Maris Otter-like malt character (biscuity, light buttery caramel), along with some fruitiness and a very quiet hop aroma; malt-driven, and a fine showcase of British malts. Medium body; medium-high CO2; a nice, endearing mouthfeel overall (the draft version was like silk). Lots of toasty, biscuity British malts first and foremost (with hints of butterscotch and caramel on the periphery); while the mentioned Amarillo additions dont really play out very prominently, the hop presence is quite smooth, with some orange and citrus flavor quietly popping up; very light red fruit notes; ultimately a crisp, solidly drinkable showcase of British malts with a light accompaniment of American hops. I could go for a more forceful display of Amarillo... but I always could. Medium-length finish of toasty and biscuity malts, with hints of an orange and mineral bitterness; nicely dry at the far end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
