380,"2015-08-08",3.1,"2011 Magnum shared by Adam C on 7/25/15.Fairly foamy white head shows poor retention atop a dull golden body that has a good clarity.Odd sweetness in the nose has hints of vanilla cookies with very tart, boisterous brett esters. So its kinda sweet and fruity....Pineapple, hickory nut skin, lemon....but just too much sugary sweetness, even from the nose. Late sharpness/heat from too much alcohol, but its not obnoxious. Other than the powdered/cookie-like sugars, its passable, if very uninspiring, just like its friend Bzart Oude Lambic.Flavor is a bit better, I guess? Though theres a weird sugar-meets-cooked-meat sorta thing. Plenty of acidity, lots of lighthearted citrus and a very, very thin texture, despite it being amply carbonated. Again, not horrendous, but with so many amazing lambics out there, the fact that this stuff is like ~50 bucks a bottle on average in America is just laughable. Some people like these softer, sweeter, more approachable lambics and thats fine, but I hate them.  If I want malt, Ill go drink a stout, thanks just the same.  Cant even bring myself to buy the kriekenlambic, though Ive never had it. They have it at Downtown Wine and Spirits for the bargain price of $65.....","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

380,"2013-04-10",3.2,"2007 Bottle year; Conditioning date of 11/2011; degorgement date of 12/2012; Bottle 016/200; Sampled April 2013.
A very soft pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a four finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a dark amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, light amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells malty somehow, perhaps this is some oxidation character, cidery but not really, definitely a bit tart, some piquant urea notes, a slight musty, woody, oak character, and, once you start digging around, a phenolic character to the finish that leans at first towards cleaning products and then plastic. There is a bit of a saw dust like character to the nose as it warms up.

Effervescent and well carbonated up front, the beer finishes with a tart / sour character, and also has a lingering, though light, cider like note to it. Slightly astringent, with a definite woodiness to it, the beer also has an oxidized / aged malt character that leans towards toasted nuts, slight sherry, a sort of caramelized character (from oxidation and not crystal malts), and perhaps even a hint of cardboard. The finish has a hint of alcohol spiciness to it, but also has a suggestion of antiseptic spray, as well as some mustiness and a certain mustiness to it. Fairly light bodied, but it does have a touch of the palate presence that a good Gueuze should have, though not quite enough, but I do like the effervescent sparkle that the Champagne conditioning has given this.

Not bad, but it certainly seems to lose something with the extra oxidation; this does add some complexity, but that speaks more to the base Gueuze being a bit on the simplistic side than being a compliment. Still this is a Gueuze, and it is decent enough for me to enjoy, though it is definitely my least favorite of the three Bzarts that I have had. I do wonder at the 2007 date, if this was barrel aged for 4 or 5 years before the bottling process I think this was a bit of a mistake; a younger, more vibrant Lambic base, without the oxidation would have been more up my alley. The oxidation isnt overwhelming here, it is just that it is a bit out of place in a decent Gueuze, so sticks out a bit in this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
380,"2013-03-12",4.1,"Bottle, 03/12/2013. Pours burnished copper, huge foamy head dies down to manageable size on the surface rather quickly, light lacing and small champagne geysers. Aroma is light sour malts with citrus flesh and red fruit, lactic notes, bit of leather, deep earthy barnyard. Taste attacks initially with sharp tart and funky burst, then citrus and bitter grapefruit with a touch of honey, medium acidity, soft sour quality and oak in a long dry finish. Sparkling palate, yet still coats the tongue after a while to give some depth. Wasnt expecting too much after the Lambiek, this was very pleasant surprise.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
