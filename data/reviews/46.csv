Une douce noix de coco et une touche de vanille, on se croirait à la plage, une bouteille de crème solaire à la main. En bouche lacidité est progressive. Cest dabord le fruit salin qui frappe puis sinstalle une douce acidité surette qui accompagne parfaitement la lime, le tout reposant sur un corps assez rond et même légèrement beurré.

46,"2015-08-03",3.8,"750 ml bottle acquired from Binnys South Loop (Chicago, IL). Pours a hazy golden yellow hue, healthy haziness in the body with frothy carbonation driven head. A firmer layer quickly dissipates to a mellow film and ringer with decent lacing. A nice summery citrus sunny glow through the body. Aromas show sea salt and earth, a bit of spiciness, bread and citrus hit the palate with jabs of coriander, mellow fruit ester coming in and some yeasty life, spice, and lactic acidity. Lime juice, orange rind oils and some pithy life. Dry, a bit grainy and tart as that bitter citric appeal sets in. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body, a touch of body with salty and spritzy sourness. Some salty mineral appeal, firmer lactic acidity up front with bitter orange rind and juice, bready malts and a bit of straw. Earth, yogurt and that distinct citric dominance. Lime juice, orange rind really are distinct. Gentle fruity ester, pear and pineapple into the middle withh dryness, flaked wheat, salt and some twangy yogurty lactic appeal hanging on for the ride as we round the corner. Finish is dry, a bit grainy and flaked wheat with that firmer lactic element hanging on, the saltiness more distinguished and at its peak at this finish. Twangy lactic appeal, dry, salty finish. I dig this, the citrusy additions add some really nice pop up front. The pour is solid, the carbonation spritzy with a firm to potent lalctic appeal and salty finish. Enough body to make it a beer (as opposed to just sourness), light enough to drink a good deal of overall. Nice. Nose a touch stale or mellow perhaps, but this one finds strength in its flavor and flow.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
46,"2015-08-02",4.0,"Bottle - 750mL crowned. Hazy golden pour with a strong, fizzy white head. Salt and citrus dominate the aroma along with yogurt, wheat and yeast. Taste is essentially a salted slice of Key Lime Pie. The lime and grains make up the pie flavor. The salt is there. Light lemon as well and the yeast rounds it out. Body is light, tart and refreshing with a strong bubbly and prickly carbonation. Ends with more Key Lime Pie and slat with yeast notes and unsweetened lemonade.

46,"2015-08-01",4.3,"On tap: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy lemon juice, light salt, citrus, and wheat. Its a hazy dull yellow with a small white head that fades to a thin film outlined by a thin ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus with a hint of wheat. The finish has moderate lemon juice, light salt, and a touch of must. Its light bodied with light-moderate carbonation. Overall, this is insanely drinkable and refreshing...but it really tastes like lemon juice has been flat out been added to the beer.
