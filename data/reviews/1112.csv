1112,"2016-07-28",4.7,"Dark purplish red color, typical atrial deep raspberry nose. This beer drinks with a richer profile with the sherry barrel not necessarily adding a huge flavor to this like with gin nocturn but a really complex profile where this beer falls flatter on the pallet and feels much more substantial in the mouth than normal atrial the additional barrel aging imparts a bigger oak profile where normal atrial you get an almost one note raspberry flavor. Medium-thick mouthfeel that gives it a perception of being lower carb.","Bellaire, Texas, USA","gephross100"

1112,"2016-03-02",4.4,"Bottle shared by Dj at the fart lobby share in the hyatt at rbwg 2016. Big thanks DJ for sharing this tiny tiny bottle (which Im sure was not easy to get) with like 10 different ratebeerians and making sure everyone got a couple nice Danish sips. This is what ratebeer is all about and DJ embodies it. The beer was pretty awesome--DJ also poured a regular Atrial so we could have them side by side. The sherry barrel def adds a little more character with sherry noted on the nose and flavor, but I cant get enough of the regular atrial and its almost perfect tart raspberry flavor. This was top notch though. My second favorite JK beer after the regular Atrial.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
1112,"2016-02-29",4.5,"500 ml bottle shared by djd07 - thanks again, DJ! Pours a hazy ruby color, darker and murkier than the regular one, with less of a head, too. Sweet and oaky Sherry barrel atop gorgeous waves of raspberries. Black cherries, lemon, funk, florals, wood. Medium-bodied, with a tart mouthfeel and low to moderate carbonation. But more sweetness than the base beer, too. While I still prefer the base beer, this is absolutely awesome stuff. Itd be hard to mess up a barrel treatment of this - and yet, they do it really well.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1112,"2016-02-02",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2016 Bottle at RBWG 2016. Lightly funky and musty nose, moderately woody nose. Red color with off white pink head. Really fucken tart lemon flavor followed by a gravely fruit presence in the throat. Good but I thought their other fruited sours were more well balanced.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

1112,"2016-02-02",4.2,"375 ml bottle to taster (thanks djd07). Looks good; a cloudy, juicy raspberry with bubbly eggshell lacing. Smells awesome! Tart, funky, and oaky with a great raspberry nose alongside a nice vinous presence from the barrel. Tastes like it smells, but not quite as fruity, with a touch of pleasant red wine vinegar. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with well-balanced acidity. Outstanding.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
