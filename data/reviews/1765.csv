500ml bottle (Gambrinus, Tartu) (7:4:6:4:13=3.4)
Lovely rich read, small frothy head, which fades slowly. Lovely aromatic lager in the glass, lots of citrussy hop, plenty of sweet fruity esters. Simple palate, a little watery, but some gentle carbonation, and the bite of nbonble hops crispens it up a bit. Lots of bready grains in the taste. Tons of esters and some ginger in the retronasals.

1765,"2012-12-01",3.4,"Tasted from the bottle, on 28/11/2012.
Pours of dark copper color with a huge foam.
Aroma is quite intense, mostly caramely sweet, slightly grapefruity in the end and a bit boozy.
Mouthfeel is smooth, low-to-mild carbonated.
Taste is interesting, a bit tart upfront, then changing into the sour/malty sweet mix.
Aftertaste is quite tart, then a bit astringent and just slightly hoppy bitter in the end. (though the bottle was off the best before).

Lightly toasted malts cooperate with peppery noble hops in this lean and big-bubbled Vienna.

-A healthy head of foam covers up the amber gown.
-The hop bitterness is also quite peppery, with a herbal touch.
-Watery passages are felt.
-Subtle tomatoes are tasted in the finish. Strange

Ambrée à la limite de lorangé, venant du malt, col crémeux beige.
Ressent de suite un malt vienna qui reste en ligne avec un type Munich et un houblon discret, le tout donne ce léger côté caramel doux voire sucrée/toasted. Houblon prend ici le siège arrière se faisant discret. Sympa et léger à boire.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
1765,"2012-01-15",3.4,"Good, receding pale cream-coloured head over amber-brown beer, slightly veiled. Little aroma, bit of biscuit - chocolatebiscuits maybe - dark green leaves; Hoppy, with undertones of dark chocolate, getting sweet in the finish. Pretty well-balanced. Not very well-bodied, bit slick. Seems somewhat undercarbonated (or is that to please CAMRA?). Good balance, but not really great beer.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Similar citrisy, malty flavours. Moderate carbonation, light CO2 prickle and a dry finish. This works for me.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Benjii"
1765,"2012-01-04",3.4,"500ml bottle. Clear, astonishingly dark copper with quickly diminishing though lacing off-white head. Amarillo hop dominates aroma completely. Taste starts in a surprising way with Märzen-like caramel malt on the ""geographic"" antipodal side. Sweetness is then wiped out by the Amarillo anew. Hops and malts do not complement perfectly, but its been worth a try. Really a special one.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"
1765,"2012-01-02",3.6,"500ml bottle, best before 27.08.12, drunk in December 2011. Clear, clean amber appearance. Clean on the palate too. Biscuity malts on the nose and palate. Seemed to have a much stronger aromatic hop presence, no doubt from the Amarillo, than when I tried it before on draught (for which I cant find the notes right now). Not usually a style I enjoy too much, probably because of the usually relatively low hop character but this hit the spot nicely, probably because of the atypically high hop presence.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

White one-finger foam, like a sheet on a red/orange/ruby totally clear and beautiful to see. Medium to high carbonation in a watery body. Contribution of Tettnanger is recognizable of course, not precisely the same about the Amarillo. High sugar taste. Just something bitter and harsh in the finish.

1765,"2011-08-18",3.6,"50cl bottle from the brewery. Heady, sweet malt aroma, with warm bread, kicks off this ruby brew. Initial impression of the flavour was ripe, almost sour fruit, but this quickly became a very pleasant light caramel, with a lovely yeasty aftertaste and a rounded alchol finish that is excellent. The hops kick in late, to add a further dimension to this impressive beer, with fresh grassiness coming through.","Carlisle, Cumbria, ENGLAND","RichardW"
