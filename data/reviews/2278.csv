Lovely dark raisiny alcohol nose.

Nearly opaque brown, rapidly-thinning thin tan head lingers at perimiter and lacing glass. Displays legs and lacing in glass.

Flavor is roastier than a typical quad imho, a refreshing deviation from the mostly dark fruit influence of the style. Fruitiness is abundant but not overwhelming as some are.

Alcohol is unmistakable, (especially 10 mins after drinking when I stood up) but not offensive or unpleasant.

Big fan of quads/Belgian Dark Strong ales. Probably among my top 5 of the style. (at least 2 are LaTrappes)","","cogitus"

2278,"2016-08-03",3.8,"10.5%ABV. Abbey quad.

Poured out black brown. 36ºSRM.

Nose has red bean paste, dates, dark stone fruit preserves, boysenberry or blackcurrant jam, grape jelly, very faint licorice. Nose on 2nd approach has some wine, port and sherry aromas.

Mouthfeel is syrupy. Palate is ponderous with a syrupy palate with brown sugar, honeyed dates, honeyed graham crackers, treacle, burnt sugar syrup, Alcoholic heat at the back of the throat. Hops are blunt, bitter and of the ""noble"" variety with a perfume-like character.

There is a bit of a blunt bitter, slightly cardboard-like flavor at the end that could be argued to be a dry woody finish.

2278,"2015-09-04",3.9,"No date on the bottle, but probably at least a year old. Almost black, lively carbonation, nice head. Nose: strong, prunes, plum liqueur, blackcurrant, wood varnish, ham, salami casings, both sweet and slightly savoury, kinda reminds of fortified wine. Alcohol is hidden better than in Rochefort 10, though this may be due to aging. Taste: prunes, autumn leaves, grape juice, custard, caramel, some raisins. Velvety body, gets foamy if you roll it in your mouth a bit. Long bitter finish, more bitter than Im used to in strong dark belgians; hops, tannins and hints of dark chocolate. Overall: very enjoyable, and on par with Rochefort 10 in my book, though R10 is a bit more unique (I miss those creamy/condensed milk notes) and beats it on price (at least in my area).","SWEDEN","23Skidoo"

OCZY : piwo ma kolor brązowy ale z daleka wydaje się czarny. Pod światło piwo jest względnie przejrzyste, brunatne. Piana jest spora ale średnio trwała i znika pozostawiając jedynie cieniutka obrączkę wokół szkła. Kolor piany jest szary. 

NOS : w aromacie dominują nuty ciasta, wanilii i mnóstwa suszonych owoców takich jak figi, śliwki, rodzynki, banan. Do tego gruszki w syropie i kandyzowane mango. Wyczuwam również czekoladę i alkohol. 

USTA : piwo jest mało gazowane, bardzo geste i tłuste prawie jak olej.
Słodkie. Jak syrop o smaku suszonych i kandyzowanych owoców. Słodkie jak karmel i mleczna czekolada. Klejące i rozprowadza się po gardle jak syrop. Bardzo bogate z nutami suszu i cierpkich goździków w tle. Do tego wanilia .... Gorzkość jest ziołowa. Nie jest mocna ale potrafi kontrować całą resztę. Zdominowana ale istotna. posmak jest owocowy i czekoladowy z cierpkimi goździkami. Może nawet troszeczkę anyżu. 

ODCZUCIA : świetne piwo deserowe. Trochę za słodkie jak na mój gust ale bardzo bogate. Rarytas, który warto spróbować.

2278,"2014-07-21",4.3,"A pezsgős dugótól megszabadítva rendkívül tömény illatokat enged szabadjára, ha eddig kételkedtünk volna, ezt követően világossá válhat számunkra, hogy nagy fába vágtuk a fejszénket - hatalmas formátumú sörhöz van szerencsénk. Miután habja kiteljesedik és felveszi végső formáját a rubinvörös árnyalatú, sötétbarna testre telepedve, az az érzésünk támad, hogy talán hónapokig is képes lenne megmaradni ebben a magasztos pózban. Komponálni sem lehetne szebbet: puha és krémes, cappuccinóhoz hasonlatos színben pompázó korona. Az illatok közben önálló életre kelnek, és egy pillanatig sem engedik tétlenkedni szaglószervünket. Dió és mogyoró, étcsokoládé - egyenesen zserbót idéző benyomások -, majd egy csipetnyi vanília és fahéj, sötét gyümölcsök túlérett változatai, valamint illatos alkohol édesítik tovább az összképet. Rendkívül súlyos, érleléshez ideális, Trappistes Rochefort 10-hez fogható ízélményben lehet részünk a jellegéből következő óvatos kortyolása közben, hasonlóan édes, desszertszerű jelleggel, valamelyest talán kevésbé testes, ám határozottabban kesernyés lecsengésű zamatokkal.

2278,"2014-06-16",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 5-18-12- 
Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a dark brown-reddish color with a thin tan head. The head faded quite fast to give a light amount of lacing.

Smell- The aroma was sweet and delicious and mainly of darker fruits. A strong presence of grape, raisin, cherry and plum were present. These were mixed with lighter notes of a bready and yeasty aromas as well. There was furthermore a nice robust alcohol aroma which created a very pleasant boozy-fruit quality overall.

Taste  The taste started out with a heavy presence of a mix of darker fruits and biscuit. The fruits were largely of raisin and grape, but soon in the taste other fruit flavors started to join the profile. In the middle the presence of cherry and a very light tropical flavor came to the tongue and mixed nicely with the grape and raisin. The biscuit subsided a bit toward the middle with the entrance of the other fruit flavors. As these other flavors entered, so to did a good helping of the alcohol that was detected in the nose. The alcohol grew stronger as the taste advanced to the end but mingled well with the fruit flavors and left a satisfying sweet boozy fruit flavor on the tongue. Very pleasant and warming.

Mouthfeel  The thickness of the body was rather average with a slightly higher level of carbonation. Both did well to create more of a wine like feel to the beer, which in some ways was fitting as it suited the sweet flavors well, but in other ways prevented some of the robustness of the brew to be savored. Its a tough call on the mouthfeel for this one.

Overall  This was sweet tasty beer that warms the body and tingles the tastebuds. Very nice.","","Darkmagus82"

2278,"2014-01-13",3.8,"The beer pours a deep mahogany with maroon highlights with a rocky, light tan head of sudsy bubbles. The head sits about a fingers width above the glass with nice lasting power. In body, the beer is deep and dark, nearly opaque, but seems to be clear of particles. On the nose, the beer of rich raisins, tart plums, and soft brown sugar and caramel malt. Touches of spicy clove and even a hint of banana esters touch upon the nose. There is even a touch of smooth breadiness and warming alcohol waft over the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy sweet with lots of fruity esters. The alcohol is very aggressive at the start of the sip but does mellow into the rest of the beer as the sip continues. Soft acidity play off the esters of the beer in the middle of the sip, but only a touch of bitter hops do touch the tongue. In flavor, the beer begins as hot, stale, spicy alcohol that mellows into sweet raisins, phenolic clove, bananas, and unripe plums with a touch of tartness. The finish brings forward bitter herbs with soft astringency, and a touch more hot booze, caramel, and more raisins. The aftertaste is soft bread and raisins in brown sugar. Stale green apple flavors hit the mouth throughout sip, and what feels like herbal tannins also make an appearance occasionally in the sip. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to full bodied. Carbonation is of middling strength, but the mouthfeel is velvety, smooth with a little harshness from the alcohol. Overall, this is a nice quad/Belgian strong ale that could use a little more time in the cellar. The alcoholic heat is a bit much and takes away from the rest of the beer. Flavors are rich, and the raisin is very dominant in the taste, but I want more of the phenols and esters from the yeast. The nose is also a bit weak in terms of the flavoring of the rest of the beer. This is a good beer that should be cellared for optimum flavoring.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

Smell: Huge jam-like aroma of berries and stone fruit. A hint of alcohol and traditional Belgian characteristics as well.

The Lost Abbey has done just that with their Judgment Day Ale. Brewed with raisins and chocolate malt, it has a delicious candy and confectionery sweetness thats never cloying or too intense. 

Its not often you drink a beer that tastes like fruit preserves, though that was the first flavor I associated with this beer. Strawberry, raspberry and blackberry are all quite prominent at the beginning of each swig. Its an authentic taste, theres not artificial about it. This is interesting considering the only fruit used in the brew is raisin. The Belgian yeast character probably accounts for that tasty fruit flavor. Only mild bitterness through the middle with a slightly roasty character of burnt toast and dark chocolate. Not quite stout-like, but it adds an additional complementary flavor without going so far as to become cloying.. An immensely enjoyable brew for all the right reasons.

Drinkability: I was a little hesitant going into The Lost Abbey Judgment Day Ale because its 10.5% ABV weight was quite intimidating. Thankfully, the big body is tame and svelte, with only mild alcohol presence here. In fact, the gentle warmth is quite pleasant and works as part of the palate. The mouthfeel itself is rather thin and tepid, lacking the usual Belgian zestiness (thankfully). Drinking multiple servings is not only tempting, but difficult to avoid.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Originally rated on 20090808. (6-4-7-4-15)
Pours clear dark ruby red color with a large, frothy head. Aroma seems quite mild at first, some ripe fruits, mild caramel and malts, as the beer warms a bit, more stuff start to appear, faint wooden notes, hints of red wine, some spices and yeast, even mild dark berries.
First thing on the flavor is some blackberry, mild plums and yeast. Caramel malts, earth and spices soon follow, some mild raspberries also. Quite creamy palate with some sourish and yeasty notes, long, creamy and a bit fruity finish. Very complex brew which I for some reason didnt seem to appreciate some three years ago. Excellent.

Right away I am kind of annoyed at this beer.  With an aggressive pour, no head forms, and I am only able to create a few large bubbles that should not be confused for carbonation.  

The aroma is sweet and raisin forward.  Dates, molasses, caramel malts, and booze are present as well.

There is something a little bit strange in the taste.  There are sweet, booze soaked raisins and dates up front, but there is a slightly tart and metallic apple cider flavor that throws me off a little bit.  It does not seem infected, but it is not that good.  Notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, and rum come through as well, with the finish still being quite sweet.

How it feels on the palate is definitely a weak spot.  There is no carbonation, and overall it has a syrupy texture and flavor to go along with the medium to full body.  There is a slightly tannic finish.

3.0 A: Clear deep amber brown color. One finger of frothy beige head that falls quickly and leaves a tiny ring of lacing.

3.5 S: Tons of plum. After that fig, currant, and raisin. Caramel with perhaps a touch of toastiness. The yeast is a bit surprising in that there isnt really any Belgian spiciness going on. Still not bad.

3.5 T: Taste is like the nose, only theres a small charred component added and its more vinous overall. Plum, raisin, fig, currant in that order. Caramel and toast. 

2.5 M: The mouthfeel is the worst part about this. Its a bit undercarbonated, but worse, the carbonation is ""dead"" as opposed to spritzy like most of its bretheren. Otherwise, smooth.

3.0 D: This has some good and some bad qualities that put this right at the middle of average.

Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of a reddish tint to it. Good white head and a bit of lacing as it fell. The nose was really heavy on the fruit character, actually too much so. There was a large amount of raisins in the forefront along with a bit of red grape and dark fruits in the background. The flavor was still really heavy on the raisin character along with a heavy dosing of sweetness. Other dark fruits in the background. Feel was sweet, though luckily not cloying. Just a bit too one dimensional as far as Im concerned.

2278,"2010-11-28",3.8,"750 mL bottle from Total Wine in Tucson, served in a snifter. Pours clear deep mahogany with a small tan head. The head remains to the end and leaves a small amount of loose lace. On the nose, there are aromas of molasses, raisins, deep roasted malts, chocolate, yeast and not much in the way of hops. The flavour is intensely caramel sweet throughout, with herbal notes and a slight bitter touch towards the finish. The sweetness is complex, with notes of raisins. The finish is long and lingering malts, wth a touch of roasted coffee. On the palate, it is full in body with a syrupy texture and soft carbonation. On the whole, this is a nice very smooth quadrupel with raisins and a nice roasted quality in the finish.

2278,"2010-04-26",4.2,"750 ml bottle received in a trade poured into my large duvel tulip glass. My superbowl beer! Woo Steelers!

A- Body appears to be a very solid dark viscous brown. Pours with a 2-3 finger foamy cream colored head. Head eventually fades to a thin collar and traces of lacing are left all the way down the glass. When held up to the light one can see this this body is very cloudy-with the cloudiness being thick and dynamic.

S- The nose is very subtle and what is detectable is mostly dark raisins with a hint of alcohol astringency.

T-Much more wonderful and complex than what I was able to pick up in the nose. The initial flavor is full of dark chocolate. The chocolate flavor is full here-but not as rich as you pick up in some stouts. Complimenting the chocolate flavors is a big presence of dark fruits such as raisin and plum, a touch of anise and a faint impression of root beer. The flavor is pretty consistent from start to finish with no big surprises at the finish. The alcohol presence is subtle and offers a bit of heat at the finish but doesnt get in the way of this ones rich complexity.

P-Low to medium carbonation (certainly not flat) and a nice full, smooth medium weight body.

O- This is a great quad and one of my favorites. The taste is great and that is what is important about it. For me the 10.5% was hidden pretty well. This is a great job done by Lost Abbey and is one of my favorite beers of theirs that I have had so far. This makes me really want to get my hands on Cuvee de Tomme.

Poured to a small snifter, a deep, ruby brown hue, with a modest, tan, tight bubbled layer to the head, and light, spotty lacing. The aroma was a mixture of malt, dark candi sweetness, caramel, a faint hint of cocoa, and a combination of dark fruit notes and light alcohol that presented a vinous nature. The flavor continued these, with some soft creaminess to the mouthfeel, modest carbonation, and a light, dry bitterness to the finish.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
2278,"2010-02-20",3.1,"I was a bit disappointed with this quad. While some of the style can be a bit much for me, I thought the rich flavor and manner in which the hefty ABV was presented in this beer were actually very well executed. The label says it is brewed with raisons, and that hefty sweetness certainly comes through. This could have been a great beer. Unfortunately, it seems there are some kinks to work out. Namely, the stuff has almost no carbonation, which really makes it feel and taste flat. I know that a lot of the darker, stronger Belgians and stouts tend to have low carbonation, but this phenomenon was taken to the extreme with this selection. It really interfered with my ability to enjoy this bottle.","Connecticut, USA","sepia5"

Did not realize this was the base beer for Cuvee de Tomme.  The sweetness really gets annihilated at some point in producing the Cuvee I guess.  Pours dark purplish brown (the label color on the bottle is not inappropriate) with a well-formed off-white head and good lacing.  Nice fruity and vinous aroma, with perfume and a little booze.  Flavor is pretty sweet and dominated by dark fruits - sweet red grapes, figs, raisins, and plums.  Not surprised to hear that its brewed with raisins.  Medium-full and mildly syrupy on the palate, with low carbonation (but not flat, as this brewerys bottled offerings have been at times in the past).

This beer is a bit of a sipper.  I remember when I was drinking it, someone wasnt very happy with me because she was ready to go home and I was still enjoying this beer.

Palate is nice being full, soft to lively, round but a bit syrupy.  Finishes with just enough bitterness from the roasted pecans and the burnt caramel, almost a bit oak-like?; other notes in the long, sweet finish include spiced rum, light raisins, candied dates, and still more caramelized dark sugars.

aroma of raisins, cola nut, alc, spices, wooden notes as if it had been on wood, cellary and mouldy notes. sweetness like marcipan. interesting aroma, the dryness, fruitiness and mouldy notes almost resembles red wine, but overall its definetly a beer.
flavor is licorice, spices, coffee, roasted grains. very powerfull with flavors that hide the alc well, or rather overshadows the alc. reminds me more of some sort of agressively brewed imperial dobbelbock mixed with quad, than a belgian quad. one of the heaviest beers i can remember to have tasted.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pinball"

The flavor had molasses, chocolate, caramel, raisins, and some mild alcohol.  Richer and much more roasty than the nose indicated.

Flavor is very nice as well, but (dare I even mention it), there isnt a lot of carbonation to speak of and it seems a bit thin at times.  This is especially the case between the forefront of dark malt and fruit and the alcoholic warmth of the finish.

After sitting on this for a year I decided it was time to open it.  In trying to thin the cellar I have been picking some of the best things sitting around.  This is quite good and worth checking it if you run across it.

Aroma / Appearance - The gradiated body starts golden and turns deep brown towards the bottom.  The lacing took its time to sink into the chewy liquid.  Dry and slightly tart it blends raisins, rye, hay, and roasted almonds.

Flavor / Palate - Fluid and chewy the mouthfeel clings to the tongue.  Melted chocolate, cinnamon, raisin bran, and some spiciness give it a nice kick.  I wonder what this one was like fresh; I bet it has changed over the past ten months.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Initial is more medium or light bodied than expected, dark fruits and caramel malts mix liberally, but a bit light on the palate and mouthfeel overall.

2278,"2009-03-25",3.7,"Pours dark reddish brown with almost no head and a fairly flat appearance. Wow they werent kidding about the raisins, first thing my nose picked up, follwed by some roast, lots of caramel, some toffee, dried plum, dark booze, some sweet bread spice and toasted wood notes. Flavor is full of raisin pudding, toasted grain, honey wheat bread, molasses, musty grass, overripe banana, date nut bread, some mossy/earthy notes, anise, burnt sugar, overripe cherry, hints of port, herbal hops, dusty attic and just a hint of pine and cedar. Finish is brandy, anise, cinamon roll, apple danish, peat and just a hint of bitterness. Palate is medium to thick with a syrupy entry and a  somewhat astringent and dry finish, mine is fairly flat throughout, not sure if that is a packaging issue or not. It seems to fail to strike a happy medium where palate and flavor sync up to have a perfect temperature together. Too cool and it loses its complexity, but is more drinkable. Too warm and it blossoms with rich Quad flavors but becomes too hot and boozy. In any case, while I wish my bottle had more carbonation It was still rather enjoyable and I may buy another to save for a snowy day.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Deep raisin, dark fruits and clean yeast sweep up and swarm the olfactory senses. Full-bodied, washing over the palate with raisin, some alcohol and yeastiness, leaving a bitter twinge on the tongue. A tickling of banana. Flavor starts leaning a bit too much toward the alcohol/ethyl that I care for as it distracts from the other complexities. After a few sips, the potency puts you in a swoon.

2278,"2009-01-09",3.8,"75cl bottle from Phil L which he gave me during GBBF 2008 and had recently brought back from his travels on the West Coast.  So massive thanks Phil for letting me have a go at a beer which otherwise I would probably never have a go at.  A long way from cask De Koninck at The Railway Hotel, Appledore at our first meeting, eh??  First impressions?  Pours really well, behaves itself and clear until nearly the end.  Doesnt explode.  And then the aroma hits you of intense chocolate toffeee.  Clear really deep ruby colour, thin lassting beige head.  Yes choc toffee on aroma but also loads of dark sour fruit too.  Black cherry coulis over a choc toffee dessert.  Even before Ive even tasted this beer, I know that I am going to love it.  It really is bizarrely a bit Belgian.  I know its supposed to be, but so many beers that try, miss by many thousands of miles, but having this after a 7 month old Orval, doesnt seem incongruous.  Yes the fruit and sweet choc toffee dont meld too well, but they are both wonderful in their own part.  It is almosst the opposite of ersatz.  It is great almost because of its individual parts.  A fruity quad?  Enormously drinkable.  I had this whilst listening to R.E.M. playing live in Athens, Greece instead of Athens, Georgia and this beer is from California instead of Belgium.  So to the scores on the doors Miss Ford.  The black cherry dark choc aroma gets a 9.  Appearance is good, but if I am being picky, I would want slightly more foam, so a 4 (the foam on the Orval I had before this would get a 5).  Flavour?  Well as I have said above the mix of sweet and tart doesnt quite work for me.  Interesting though, so I guess an 8.  Palate has some acidity, some fullness, its no better than a 3.

Flavor is likewise full of sweet, caramel malts, dark fruit, a bit of roasty chocolate to help offset things slightly, and a decent level of booze.  Palate is smooth, and this is easily drinkable given the ABV (albeit slightly undercarbonated, possibly due to my aging of the beer), but you know there*s some alcohol in here as it warms the palate nicely.  Good offering from Lost Abbey.","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
2278,"2008-12-18",3.5,"750mL bottle courtesy of KingG poured into a snifter.

Pours a dark, murky cola brown with red tints around the edges. The tan head recedes slowly and leaves a lit bit of lacing.

The aroma is mainly dark fruit with raisins and plums with a strong bready malt base underneath. Smells almost like a grape cola oddly enough.

The taste is a bit better than the aroma for me with a little more complexity. There are the dark fruits up front with a bit of chocolate in addition. There is some sweet caramel and vanilla hints in the middle with the big Belgian yeast backbone.

The mouthfeel is well carbonated and maybe a tad thin for the style but style sweet and sticky.  This is certainly not in the class of the best quads but its definitely a solid brew with an interesting fruitiness that makes it slightly unique.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

2278,"2008-11-30",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2009 750 ML Bottle-Murky mahogany color w/no head but good carbonation. Sweet, cherry aroma. Had a lot of bite on the front end; flavors of cherry, raisins, figs, plums & dark fruit. Had a bit of a sweet finish to it. Wasnt too crazy about this when I started it, but it perked up a little as it warmed. Alcohol was very well hidden, but you could feel its effects. Guess Im just in the minority on this one, but it really just wasnt my cup of tea. Long, sour fruity finish.

Much fresher and fruitier than the Belgian renditions than I have had, and to be honest, I prefer this version better. Syrupy mouthfeel with light carbonation.

2278,"2008-06-26",3.7,"2008 bottling Batch 2; Sampled June 2008
A stout pour produces a three finger thick, amber stained, darker tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is a dark, concentrated plum color that shows a brilliantly clear, ruby color when held up to the light.  The aroma is fruity smelling and perhaps a bit more subdued than I was expecting.  Toasty grain notes are also noticeable as they mix with the more dominant notes of prunes and raisins.  A spiciness starts to become noticeable as well providing notes of woody black pepper, an earthy-herbal note, some sweet clove phenolics and something that is a mix of fruit and spice, but reminds me of cola or Dr. Pepper.  A touch of toasty, almost roasted, sort of nutty malt character comes through in the aroma as the beer warms up.  I am not sure about the aroma here, not nearly as expressive or interesting as I was hoping, though it is certainly not bad.

Sweet tasting up front, a bit viscous and chewy, though it is not cloying.  Flavors of savory prunes, raisins and a fruity nutty note come through up front.  The beer finishes with a mix of toasted malt, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols as well as a touch of tamarind like fruitiness and light tartness.  Flavors of brown sugar, caramelized fruit, toffee, rum-soaked sugar and even a sort of cinnamon note (not really but something evocative of this spice).  Spicy notes of clove, perhaps a hint of ginger, some pepper (from the medium carbonation as much as anything), a touch of cardamom and a smidgen of mace.  

The second pour of this brew yields a much more aromatic nose that takes on a very savor, concentrated malt and fruit character in addition to the rich spice notes mentioned previously.  The flavor really develops a richness induced by the concentrated malt / raisin notes, but it is accented heavily by the underlying, fermentation derived, spice and fruit character.  I really like the savory, lightly tart tamarind note that this beer has to it.

This has definitely improved over last years vintage; I think this will age better and is currently much more integrated and drinkable.  It still is not quite at the level I expect from this brewery though.
First Release Sampled multiple times
Total  is equal to  3.4 7/4/6/4/13
Pours with a frothy, initially half-finger thick, darkish, amber-tan colored head.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, dark, purple tinged, ruby color when held up to the light, otherwise it is quite a dark, opaque, burn amber color.  The aroma smell strongly of dark fruit with notes of figs, raisins and prunes all being present.  Some dusty malt presence is also here, perhaps something like chocolate, but not really, perhaps more like toasted grain, or is this the signature of some blackened raisins.  Some vibrant fruit notes become noticeable after a bit, with aromas of cherries and concentrated tropical fruit even.

A rich body, yet without being overly sweet.  The beer actually finishes quite dry because of an astringent, perhaps burnt quality.  Up front though it does have a sweetness, which accentuates a dark fruit character.  Quite a bit of dusty malt character is here it sort of tastes something like dusty cocoa powder, but other times like dusty astringent grain husks.  As my palate gets used to this beer it loses some of the sweetness, and even picks up a touch of acidity (is that roast / dark grain derived).

After stories of people getting off bottles of this, I can say that I have had four of these now, purchased from three different parts of the country, that have not been off.  Having said that, this beer could use a bit of work.  It is not at the level of excellence that the last bottle of MOAB that I had was.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Thin head of cottony foam bubbles up, clearing quickly to leave a thin layer and a rim that laces nicely throughout the drink.  Smells of sweet dark fruit- raisins, prunes, some grape notes.  Flavor moves in some varying directions.  Theres the dark fruit from the nose, with some figs showing up in addition to the raisins, prunes, etc.  Theres a distinct but balanced boozy note; and smooth malt base that shows off toasted biscuits and table sugar.

An esthery ride takes over the tongue on first sip - lots of deep fruit, apples, pears, etc.  A second wall of dark malts follow up with bitter chocolate and rum drenched plums.  The alcohol is apparent and heavy, battling the smoothness of the malts.  Maybe this botte needs some time to even out, but as is it is pretty mediocre.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

2278,"2008-04-12",3.4,"strong lasting aromas of raisin, fig and the caramely base found in my favorite types of barleywine.  poured in a trappist glass, but the head was thin and short lasting.  the beer itself though is a respectable mysterious dark dark brown with ripe plum hues and some haze.  sweet in the mouth, nearly sticky and off putting.  still young and sharp.  oh goodness, now i notice a thick sludgy film on the bottom of the glass.  looks like thisll be a two-stager.  initially theres some cherry and walnut, but the sharp alcohol cuts a bit deep and i want to either store another bottle for a year or bring an open flame to the glass and reduce the liquid.  after swirling and adding the bonus goodness to the remaining beer in my goblet the beer mellowed significantly as i drank the first part much too quickly to let the octane influence my opinion.  the ripe berry notes came out more on top of the sting and the body thickened only a touch.  Ive really been looking forward to this beer, and now I will look equally forward to enjoying an older bottle.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
2278,"2008-04-07",3.9,"This packs the punch that Lost & Found didnt have. Also brewed with raisins, which lends it an aroma and a flavor of (you guessed it) raisins, along with other dried fruits... but this one sticks to the darker side of the spectrum - plums, figs and grapes rather than apricots. A bit of yeasty bread in there, too, making this like a good sweet bread made with raisins. Pours a deep brown with a thin head, the aroma is *very* sweet, and the carbonation - while lively - isnt overpowering, partly because this beer is much thicker than the others Ive tried from Lost Abbey. While not quite up to some of the real Belgian quads Ive tried (Im still just not sure about raisins), this is a wonderful effort at an incredibly complex beer. Careful, though - this one belies its 10.5%.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

It did have a dark brown body tinted with red though. It did have a fairly vinous nose. It did have a flat and dark fruity flavor full of warmth and alcohol and woodiness. It did leave me with a crazy headache. Not sure why. Tasty and interesting but with consequences.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","MadMan"

Bodys light, almost bordering on the watery. Mid-palate could use a lot more depth and complexity--mostly a raw, tingling oak flavor. Very dry. The finish is rather acetic.

2278,"2007-12-25",4.3,"750 ml bottle, thanks to Jason.  Firm and thick volcanic red pour; lazy, thin white skin.  Pineapple oils and singed caramel glaze a pungent bleu cheese in the aroma; apples, raisins, dry pistachio, and white sugar.  So pleasingly heavy, rich, and just dancing with nuances.  Taste brings a simple canvas of brandy heat and rich oak tones of toasted vanilla; warming but not hot, smooth, and sensitive.  Bold and bitter maple wood, tart cherries, and softly forceful Malbec tannins fill in underneath as the body grows darker, more concentrated, and more serious with every sip.  Hints of blackberry and caramelized onions dripping with balsamic lend a tangier zest of sweetness and pleasantly understated sourness; plenty of creme brulee crust tempers all the tangents into a cool and and creamy general statement.  Well aged.  Phenolic notes, bananas, hot rum and spicy cheeses in staccato bursts before the finish; warming, full, and sparkly in the mouth.  Hints of raw cocoa, mint, quieted tobacco and an acidic pulse at the end; conjuring the subtle brilliance of the cuvee as it reveals its full and detailed spectrum of flavors in slow release.  Pure, wild, and astonishing.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Flavor is really tasty with all the above and some chocolate throwninto the mix. The downfall of this beer is its flatness.  I cant tell if it went flat on me or if its supposed to be this way. It is not the worst flatness Ive experienced but its up there.  It doesnt detract from the experience as much as it would if the rest of the beer wasnt so friggin spectacular though.

The nose is as much raisin as it is malt.  Very fruity with lots of yeast and a touch of alcohol.  Quite sweet smelling.  Big heavy fruity malt grabs you first, then the sweet raisin and alcohol come on in the finish.  The alcohol is a tad hot, but not overpowering.  Very yeasty on the finish as well.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and sweet, but not sticky or cloying.  Warming all the way down the esophagus.  Overall, this was decent, but definately one of my least favorite from Lost Abbey.

2278,"2007-11-02",5.0,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Thin, tan head that dissipates quickly to a rim around the glass. Nearly black body with tiny bubbles streaming up the glass. Dark and almost intimidating. Looking up through the beer, you can tell it is clear, despite the darkness, and this perspective shows a dark chestnut color. Warm fruity aroma with notes of prune, brown sugar, spice, and alcohol. Nice roasted malt with a hint of milk chocolate initial flavor with light bitter aftertaste that is relatively long lived with an alcohol finish. This brew comes across almost as a strong stout/barley wine cross. It is full bodied with slightly syruppy feel that coats the side of your tongue and the back of your throat. The lively, almost fizzy carbonation keeps it ffrom feeling too heavy. Overall, this beer has a nice subtle aroma that is reliatively complex and pleasant.

2278,"2007-11-01",3.8,"750ml bottle brought to you by Tronraner. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head. I was expecting a blast of raisins on this one, but its not that intense. The aroma is a tasteful rendition of the Quad style with an assertive level of vinous sweetness. Light hints of cloves are present with the ubiquitous raisins, bread, and dark spices. The palate is medium heavy hinting at the presence of 10.5% abv, but never really proclaiming it. This is a sweeter quad, but not overly so. Just appropriate suggestions of raisins and brown sugar are highlighted.  Earth and semi-drying spiced tones leave a satisfying finish. Carbonation is quite low which allows the maltier, breadier aspects to shine nicely. All in all, this is a very well done Belgian styled ale, but it lacks those intricacies that the dedicated masters of the craft painstakingly evoke. Id drink this again with a grin on my face.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
2278,"2007-10-19",4.0,"The beer pours from the 750ml cork and caged bottle a rather hazy brownish red with a large creamy light tan head that fades away leaving a velum like coating of lace. Nose is rich in sweet malt, fruit aromas; Id say cherries with a bit of raisins. Start is fruity sweet; the malt presence makes the top feel moderate, touch of alcohol bitterness at the back. Finish has a spiny acidity, alcohol warms the belly, and hops provide some spiciness, dry and long lasting aftertaste, quite a nice drinking beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

I prefer my beers not overly carbonated and this is surprisingly good.  It needs just a hint of carbonation to add to the mouthfeel, and to slow down my consumption of this thing.

2278,"2007-08-19",4.2,"Translucent cherry cola in color with pinpoint bubbles hugging the glass and popping on top. Aromatic assurances abound from prunes and black fruited figs, graced by brown sugar. Broiled dates and chocolate soot on slabs of black currant further caress the olfactory. A rig of caramelized and slightly burnt rhubarb sings scentimatically as well. Flavor comes in as ripe for the picking. Black cherries meet a burnt raspberry chocolate underbelly while figs and dates droll up more dark fruited wonderment. Ash crusted pecans create a burnt, woodsy backdrop and the currant and dried concord jam on cocoa rye balances the aggression of the ale. Raw, piney bitterness is kept in check by the singed chocolate bricks. Fuller bodied and bountiful at every angle. It builds momentum through the night. Burnt caramel and  blackened - yet caramelized - prune-laden and cocoa-nip accentuated - figgy pudding lays into the finish.

2278,"2007-07-24",3.6,"750ml bottle: Pours to a totally opaque dark brown that when held to the light allows little light through except towards the very top, showing just a bit of a lighter nut brown color.  A small to medium sized tan colored head forms atop the beer, one that slowly fades to a tiny ring around the outside of the glass.  The nose has an intense, sweet malt flavor, showing hints of dark raisins, sweet caramel & toffee malt, along with a darker molasses scent, though without any acidic scent associated with molasses.  Sticking my nose deeply in the glass allows me to experience some aromas of fig, smoked fig, light vanilla bean or mild oak wood, and some hints of herbs.  Taste is alcohol at first, followed by dark malt syrup, caramelized sugars, roasted dried raisin, hints of bitter hops in the background that are largely overcome by the sticky-sweet notes of bark, chocolate (though without the sweetness), with bits of a caramel/grain malt flavor showing through.  Medium-full bodied, feeling very heavy in the mouth, medium carbonated, though showing very smooth & mild bottle-conditioned carbonation.

Light chocolate notes, brown sugar, and caramel malt all make fleeting appearances. Sweet rich malt flavour, with more caramel and light brown sugar give a fairly sweet flavour, yet it finishes on the bitter side, presumably from the hops.

2278,"2007-06-14",3.9,"6/14/2007:  Lost Abbey Judgment Day cloudy/murky amber/dark milk chocolate brown color.  This is initially a thin, dark beige crown that quickly diminishes leaving nothing behind.  The aroma is very complex and intriguing.  It is sweet with a nice alcohol presence and filled with a deep, rich caramel, dark fruits, raisin, and subtle char/smoke quality as well as some delicate banana and Belgian spiciness.  The flavor is equally complex and deep with sweet caramel malt, fruit, subtle char/smoke/caramelized sugar.  The finish is slightly dry and has a lingering chocolate flavor.  The alcohol is there as well, but it isnt overbearing or astringent.  It complements the other flavors of this beer very well and provides a nice warming sensation.  Actually, this beer reminds me of raisins soaked in bourbon (I do that to pump up the rasins when I am using them in bread or rice pudding).  Also, drink this beer at a slightly warmer than usual temperature.  It really opens up when it gets warmer.  Wow!  ... This beer is pretty smooth on the palate for such a big beer and has a medium body with a mild level of carbonation.  Overall, Judgment Day is very good, very enjoyable, and quite easy to drink.  Maybe I should re-bottle some of this in another bottle so I can try it again tomorrow night.  Nah, that would be stupid.

Nice quad aroma of dark fruits, brown sugar, a tiny bit of chocolate.  Very full bodied mouthfeel.  The thickest and creamiest quad Ive had.  Chocolate roastiness is the most evident flavor which was quite surprising.  Like a cross between a stout and a quad.  Interesting and unique.

2278,"2007-05-22",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2007 Very dark purple brown colored body, very thin head, really only showing up around the edges of the glass.  Viscous and sticky on the sides of the glass.  Straight maple and raisin oatmeal nose, sweet and alcoholic, with scents of dates, light wood, and some light chocolate and amaretto coffee.  Under-carbonated and a little thin/watery, but at a warmer temperature it works.  There’s some smoked malts mixed in with the more prominent maple and raisin flavors, or perhaps more of a smoked plum and burnt maple syrup flavor.  Dries out in the finish, and ends with more parched, woody and dried fruit flavors, which I think helps against the overall sweetness of this beer.  Good stuff, a little too boozy and hot, of course more so as it warms.  Likeable but something I’d pass on in the future for more well-rounded strong dark Belgian ales.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2278,"2007-05-16",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2008 Poured a dark brown with hints of garnet.  Aroma immediately shows the raisins that this was brewed with, some chocolate, dirt, leaves, and a little candy sweetness.  Sweet dark fruity flavor, some raisins, chocolate, bubblegum.  Finishes earthier with some tobacco, dirty, cherry.  This is where the bubblegum quality seemed a bit off.  It was fine otherwise, but too much in the finish.  Lingering dry aftertaste.  Full bodied slick, low carbonation, and a little hot.  This beer has a lot to offer, Id love to try some as it ages.  Perhaps I should order some more....


Upon revisiting, the bottle I opened is pretty lacking in carbonation and only holds a few bubbles and a small amount of head.  Dissapointing texture and appearance.  however, the taste shows a much more mature beer, no bubblegum tendancies to be found, lots of raisin, toffee and nut flavor.  Like a stronger Chimay Blue, just more raisin and a hoppier more varied finish.  If any of the other two bottles are carbonated, Ill raise my score.


Thanks to the newer bottling in 08, I can try some carbonated bottles.  The bubblegum is all gone and the malt flavors are all over the place.  Raisins, wood, caramel, brown sugar, blackberries (not the phone), its got a lot of nice things.  I could always go for a sweeter beer, but balance is the thing here, and Judgement certainly excels in that these days.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
2278,"2007-05-14",4.1,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Slightly murky, dark brown pour with streaks of mahogany and peach skins, topped with a thin layer of creamy off-white head.  Could stand to use a little more carbonation at this point out of the bottle, but the head is a marvelous layer of froth on draught.  Aromas of clean belgian yeast, chewy figs, and juicy red pear flesh combine to create a thick raisin-bready malty bouquet highlighted by chunks of lighter fruits.  Notes of green raisin, light vanilla, and confectioners sugar are also noticeable.  Quite fruity and yeast without being overly spicy.  Medium to full bodied, creamy carbonated mouthfeel.  Much darker and more complex with deep fruity richness than found in the nose.  Well baked raisin bread coats the palate, along with some dry tobacco tones and a leathery texture.  Finishes a touch hot with a healthy dose of euro-hops to balance.  Some gentle black cherry skin tannins linger into the final smack.

2278,"2007-05-04",3.8,"Very thick, deep caramel brown with subtle violet hues and foreboding cloudy tints of rich mahogany that will hopefully entice Christina Applegate into my apartment. Thin off-white head forms and rapidly submerges back into the body. Adequate and randomly thick lacing. Aroma is quite plummy and moderately pruny. Candy sugar plays a powerful and captivating role here, perhaps coming on a little too strong initially. Marshmallow encrusted graham cracker scents are noted. The banana notes that are present, and so intensely prominent, remind of banana chips and are too tropically fruity to command an excited rating of the aroma. Otherwise its nice, this would probably fare incredibly well at the one year mark. Flavor is very nice, on e hell of a hearty and fruity taste. The dark fruits mixed with the yeastiness that is so exaggerated in the flavor begins to taste like banana-raisin pudding. Alcohol, as it was in the aroma, is quite noticeable. Breadiness is fiery with spice, somewhat quenching, extremely full. Palate is extra full bodied, lightly bitter and sticky. Finishes with excessive sweetness and cooperative and pleasing alcohol dryness.

Raisins, plums and dates carry chocolate and roastiness, as roaming alcohol heat converses with earthy hoppiness in this seductive Quadrupel. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles a purplish brown gown.
-The nose offers some sweet fruitiness alongside bubblegummy candy notes.
-Carbonation is prickly and effervescent.
-Light fruity tartness and leafy hoppiness succeed in balancing the flavor profile.
-This improved greatly with a year or so on it.

Posseses a thin, velvety texture then goes creamy as she warms. Huge, deep seated dark fruit malts purge forward w/ a defined peach pit bittering component riding its back.

2278,"2007-04-22",4.0,"Deep mahogany body with notable density and a fleeting beige head. Aroma of caramelization, raisins, toffee, and fried bananas. Flavor is complex and not cloying with elements of dark rum, caramelized fruit, and bourbon.  Marked bitterness with herbal qualities quickly emerges and distinguishes this from Trappist quads.  Might benefit from more carbonation and extended cellaring to scrub this out a bit. Very good nonetheless. Cleaner and more authentic than MOAB in my experience.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
2278,"2007-04-22",3.9,"Draught.
Dirty, murky brown colour with a small soapy tan head. The aroma is surprisingly fruity with lots of raisin and plum leading into toasted malts and caramel. Very rich flavour - smooth roast, very plummy/fruity with toasted cereal and toffee in the middle. Alcohol warmth is apparent. Very tasty and drinkable.


Sampled at the Pizza Port 12 Hour Belgian Beer Party on March 24, 2007.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
2278,"2007-04-21",4.3,"Deep brown with a medium head. Aroma of dark fruits, brown sugar and a bit of alcohol.  Rich and sweet taste; raisins, toffee, yeast.  Alcohol seems better covered in the taste. Just a little hot. Rum-like. 
Near heavy body and a sticky texture. Moderately sweet and slightly bitter. Up there with the best.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","MrBendo"
2278,"2007-04-20",4.2,"Thick glug pour, love that sound! Very dark fruit forward aroma. First sip I knew I was in for a treat. This has a definite raisin flavor. I taste only a slight resemblence to DFH raisin dextra, which is way sweeter. I like this more, its balanced, complex and simply unique. Glad I have a few more to sit on and see how it matures!! So far, every beer I have had from Port Brewing/Lost Abbey has been outstanding.","Oceanside, California, USA","ChazMania"
2278,"2007-04-20",3.5,"Nice little treat from SouthBay Liquor down at Imperial Beach. Strong sweet aroma of sugar,  toffee, and also a rich malt backbone. Appears as a fizzy glass of coca-cola with almost no head formed. Color is a dark tinted brown with red transparency.  The drink runs a little thin and has a sweet flavor of undeniable raisin, sour grape, and a hard toffee candy taste.  Aftertaste is close to a caffeine beverage or iced coffee.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
2278,"2007-04-20",4.0,"Brown, with a tan head. Aroma is malt, raisins, dark fruit, and brown sugar. Flavor is raisins, malt, dark fruit, alcohol, and maybe a touch of spices. Another strong Lost Abbey brew, but more sweetness would put this over the top. 
Thanks to dirty_martini for this bottle.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
2278,"2007-04-20",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2007 Bottle sampled. Pours deep brown with a decent size beige head. Aroma of alcohol, raisins, fruit, and spices.

2278,"2007-04-19",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2007 Bottle from South Bay Drug. Poured a decent head that lasted a long time. Color was redish brown. Smells of Banana, cherries. Tastes of Banana, cherries, raisins, Spice, malt. Very good. Had this side by side with a Westy 12. Tough camparison but it stood up nicely for an American abt/quadrupal.","(San Diego) Santee, California, USA","padrefan98"
2278,"2007-04-17",4.3,"Bottle. Sampled at Tria Fermentation school Lost Abbey class 4/16/07. Deep Ruby Brown with a thick off white head. Big malty aroma with raisins, yeast and pepper. Thick mouthfeel. Big malt flavors, raisins, yeast and some spice. Delicious, I cant wait to get some bottles for my cellar.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
2278,"2007-04-17",4.2,"750 mL served in my Arendsnest glass.  Pours fairly dark and appears murky brown in the glass.  Quickly diminishing head.  Aromatically, im not impressed.  However, I think the flavor is very impressive.  In particular, it becomes very complex after the mid-palate with a pleasant sweetness, hints of brandy soaked fruits, caramel, cocoa and hops.  Overall, im very impressed with this beer and a proud patron saint.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
2278,"2007-04-17",4.0,"from the bottom of the bottle thanks toWeeHeavySD. I showed up late, so the beer had already sat out for a bit but the tempture and lack of carbonation beer no problem.  Dark brown with purple hints, aroma of dark fruit. Flavor was sweet with fruit, prunes and raisins most noticably. Lots of alcohol in this one. another great brew from lost abbey.","san diego, California, USA","bikesandbeers"

2278,"2007-04-15",3.8,"Full draught glass at PP 12 hour fest on 3/24/07Let the glass warm and breath for about 45 minutes while I was in line for pizza, I think this helped a lot.  Not much of a head to speak of, though Im sure that will change with the bottle (maybe).  Dark brown with violet-burgundy tints on the edges and a medium-low clarity.Rather sweet, but not a malty sweetness dominating; guess its the raisins.  Regardless, theres ample Belgian yeast, giving it more of a Belgian Dark Strong feel.  Light banana/vanilla and lots of tart prune and black pepper notes on the finish.  Hazelnut skins and light roast, almost in the quantity seen in some dubbels, it helps further add balance in concert with the phenols.  Warming and vaporous alcohol is moderately present on the finish.  Definitely different and not quite as polished as MOAB, but its also very young.Sweet and malty, with an ample adjunct sugar presence (candi sugar, raisins), it still manages to pick up a fair amount of vinousness (prunes, concord grapes) and light roastiness, to offset the caramel/toffee sweetness.  Lightly tart yeast notes sit on the finish, rather pleasantly but there is a strong blandness or sort of tannic-like dryness, perhaps you might say breadiness, that sticks to the palate and cuts in to the livliness of the flavors.  The carbonation is low and though not really loose, does give the beer a bit of a heavy feel to it.  Alcohol is perceivable, with warming and definitely makes itself felt, but at least helps cut some of the chewy toffee and raisin sweetness.  Interesting stuff, and no doubt it should develop in to a better beer with some aging, as the raisins relax the strong hold they have on the beer and the yeast produces some deeper complexities.  Will revisit, of course.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2278,"2007-04-15",3.9,"750 purchased at the brewery.  Damn this is so strong.  Pours purply red with a slight thin shell head.  The aroma is grapey with a raisanish nowse.  The taste is very strong, but more than the abv suggests.  It is huge, and potent and sweet and crazy strong.  I like it but damn I think this really needs to mellow in bottle for a while to get to be a bit more smooth.  Hits you like a kick in the head.  Great Label.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
2278,"2007-04-14",3.9,"On tap at the PP 12 hour fest: Deep chocolate hue with little head or lace. Some oily coating on the glassware. The aroma has notes of earthy yeast esters, mocha, grassy hops, weak coriander, raisin and plum, and some metallic vapours. The taste starts with a rich malty overtone with a ripened prune character. Mild earthy finish with a tad spot of smoke. The mouth feel is soft, lush and rich and fairly dry for something with this sweetness. I dig it and found a constantly evolving palate.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2278,"2007-04-13",3.5,"Raisins...yes...  A wee bit too heavy with the raisins.  I would really like this with a little less raisin.  It was like eating a box of them.  Not my thing, but a good beer nonetheless.","Long Beach, California, USA","UselessGdTaste"
2278,"2007-04-08",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2007 Maaallllty! Yeah!  Its really great to try a dark beer, where the dark color comes from something other than roasted malts...in this case raisins I think.  Sweet molasses, plums, vanilla and raisins.  Ive tried other beers with raisins and havent been impressed, but Judgment Day is really delicious.  I bought a growler at Port Brewing Companys tasting room.  the alcohol is well suppressed.  It supposed to be brewed in limited quanties so Ib going to buy one to store for a year.  Again, great beer.  My highest rating yet:  4.6.

2278,"2007-04-07",3.8,"Hand bottled, from ClarkVV. Murky, rusty brown with tiny, tan bubbles for a head. The aroma is prunes, light banana, light spice and toffee.

2278,"2007-04-07",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2007 750ml bottle from Pizza Port Carlsbad. a pretty dank brew! almost no head upon pouring, with little carbonation. color was daarrrkk, even for a quad, near black in the middle, with deep mahogany edges...reminded me of a soda almost. aroma mostly of alcohol, fruits and some roasted nuts in there. flavor: RAISINS! caramel, candy sugar and plums. palate finishes in strong dry alcohol with toffee notes and touch of smoky malts. A great impersonation of a true quad, but Id take the big Trappist ales over this anyday.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
2278,"2007-04-05",3.7,"12oz bottle, courtesy of artusory.  Thanks, Ryan!  Pours a orangish-ruby core with a milky white top; light, big-bubbled head with the slightest hints of retention.  Cola and light cocoa and alcohol in the aroma; esters and dough.  Full, chewy mouthfeel: plenty of esters and banana bread, vanilla and hints of a buttery / caramel goodness; this reminds me like a clearer Weizenbock-like rendition of Mother of All Beers; more focused and creamier.  Medium, creamy banana and estery finish; slightly chalky end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2278,"2007-04-01",3.2,"Courtesy of clarkVV.  Pours still with only a few scattered hints of bubbles.  Smells of oak, alcohol, herbs, figs, caramel, splashes of spices.  Tastes of dark chocolate, cognac, oak, and pronounced alcohol.  As the beer warms, cherry hints emerge.  Finish is bitter with alcohol.  Too much alcohol present in this one.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
2278,"2007-03-31",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2007 Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. On tap. Deep musky caramelized raisin paste aroma, with faint lamb spicing and roasting toffee. Very murky, muddled deep mahogany, with ochre fringe. Rim is tan. Flavor a beautiful, bold mingle of english toffee and chocolate, lightly roasted been, creme brulee crust, toasted hazlenut and almond and walnut extracts. A very brash and biting run of caramelization and nuts. Dries over these cooked sugars and the Maillard reaction. Good depth and hefty body amongt the sugars and a beautifully guised 11%. Epitome of caramalized malts.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
