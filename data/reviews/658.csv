Aroma of caramelized malt and toffee is wonderful with light lingering peat notes also discernable. Taste is a wonderful mix between some caramelized notes with some toffee and residual sugar notes with light but perceptible notes of peat malt. This is perfectly balance while not being too sweet and not too smoky. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Very good in the style indeed, but it seemed slightly different, with its own fruity and cerealish personnality.  Delicate caramel sweetness and a great texture, creamy or somewhat velvety.  The hops are balancing it all but aint dominating.  Even if I was slightly positively prejudiced towards this scotch ale, I am not disapointed nor overwhelmed...

658,"2007-03-05",4.0,"At brewpub, aged one year.  Dark mahogany body with a medium tan head.  Toffee and figs taste abounds in a surprisingly soft body.  More and more raisins flavour as it warms up.  A lot of roasted flavours even leading to an ashes sensation in the finish.  Subtle citrusy tartness increases drinkability.  Definitely not the heavy filling type of Scotch Ale.  Not a lot of brown sugar and thick toffee usually present in high gravity Scotch Ales.  This one is deceptively easy to drink.  As far as Quebec Scotch Ales are concerned, only a bottle of Corne de Brume can top that.  Among brewpub Scotch Ales the Reyne Descosse is the Boss des Bécosses.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Layered, full body.

658,"2006-12-19",4.4,"12 oz draught at the brewpub in the company of Goldorak and MDS, served gratis by brewer Nicholas.  This is the 2nd batch, which he hasnt put on yet, but if you ask me its set to go.  Pours a very nearly opaque maple to dark brown with an everlasting small-to-medium darkish tan head....gorgeous thick, caramelly aroma with faint smoky wisps, vanilla, a center of the richest chocolate-caramel nougat and odd hints of coconut, totally decadent....and on the tongue, it doesnt disappoint, with a plummy oak-vanilla texture permeating the tasting, overlaid by caramel and milk chocolate, a faint vinous tartness....as it warms, acrid smoky peaches (yes that sounds weird I know but thats what it seemed like) emerge in the nose, making even more complexity of an already wonderful treat.....a touch too much acidity at the finish and perhaps slightly too little carbonation which makes for a bit of doughiness, but this is in any case spectacular and if Nicholas thinks it will be better in a month, count me in for returning for more.

658,"2006-02-26",4.2,"A dark crimson shade that was hard for me to focus in on, the lights were darker than usual...Anyway, it wasnt quite opaque but almost, with a frothy head that held its own nicely.
Toasted walnuts, hops were fruity and the alcohol finish was light, with a tiny bit of that corky, aged aroma that was subdued enough to be quite pleasing.
My first sip surprised me with its silken, lacy smoothness, the carbonation almost absent.  A very mellow sherry/Madeirized flavor that mingles well with the solid chunk of caramel malt and pretty much cancels out any lingering alcoholic vapors or unpleasant tannins.  Bitterness is almost inexistent, the finish is delightfully sweet yet not cloying at all, it was a pleasure to drink from start to finish.  This Beer really hit all the right buttons for me.  Nicolas, the brewmaster, procrastinated for months before releasing it (9 to be exact), but it was sure worth it, kudos to him.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

To this rich aroma of caramel, toffee and chocolate, you can not resist to the invitation of undressing it a little more.  Once you go a little further and you bring it to your lips you can admire all its complexity; everything is well balanced! You assist to a harmonious tango between sweet malt, warming alcohol, caramel, toffee and chocolate.  It felt a little more attenuated then most Scotch Ale I had but it brings more complexity as it exhibits all the subtle elements that would usually be hidden behind decadent malt.

658,"2006-02-22",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2010 Any first impressions?
-The top of my tulip was a garter belt of lacing all the way through, suggestively crowning the regal mahogany below.
-An inviting caramel malt lipstick seduced in subtlety with its fruity incantations.
-Chocolate-covered caramel was lascively being fed to me, as fingers were begging to be licked clean. -Exploding berry juices at once aroused and relaxed.
-The kiss was luxurious, yet never sloppy, a mouth of velvet on which you can stay and reap the pleasures from for long minutes.

What if you dig deeper?
-She had hidden bulging grapes, toasted bread, and fruit jujubes within and around the bed sheets, for the long run of course.
-To be sure the height of passion could be reached, she warmed me up with a caress of alcohol just before I fell.
-Her bodys effervescence was simply perfect, not too agitated, not too lax, letting all her sweet, sensual attributes do their thang to me.
-Her skin was satin, folks. The most lascivious satin.

658,"2006-02-20",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2006 Purple reflects intensify the deepset cuban cigar hue. The big-bubbled covering off-white head shows moderate persistence. Initially subtle, gently peaty, concealing its alcohol and asking to breathe. The malt grows steadier as it warms, developping an earthy confidence that eventually evolve into chocolatey territory, but stays away from mainstream caramel sweetness abundance and chooses a malty yet vinous fruity playground as its residence. Evocations of grapes, figs, berries, plums, toasted cakebread are supported by a leveling alcohol warmth coat that screams of happiness in the diplomacy and delicacy the sweetness shows. Thinner than youd expect, once again focusing on fruitiness rather than unjustified weight, enhancing drinkability obviously and showcasing its elaborated carbonation, palate cleansing and mostly lasting. Clashing fruitiness embodies multidimensionality. Great flavors in there, charming balance makes a statement of toasty complexities among the juicy nature.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
