584,"2016-06-16",4.0,"Sample poured at Allagash. The pour is a darker amber color with a nice thick white head that slowly dissipates down to a thick bubbly collar with a good lacing. The aroma is very caramel forward. There is a light maltiness and Belgian spiciness to it, but the caramel lingers through out, which is why I think I like dubbels. Light alcohol on the back end. The flavor is definitely malty. There is a little twinge to let you know its not a traditional amber or English style ale, but its malty and caramel heavy like one. The mouth feel is a little thin on this with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly caramel malty finish. This is a good surprise!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

The yeast character is transformative...it once had smelled like a boring (American take) Dubbel, but quickly had turned into something much more...was essenially akin to consuming stale pumpernickel doused in an expired store-bought punch blend...that sounded as if its distinctiveness had been horrendous and undrinkable, but, oddly enough, its unique, hearty, and palatable.

584,"2014-08-25",3.8,"I poured a 12oz bottle into an official Allagash tulip glass. It was bottled on 4/3/14 and cost $3.99 ($0.33 per ounce).

Appearance: Pretty chestnut red/mahogany hue. Pours to a two-finger, off white, foamy head which retains and laces fairly well.

Smell: Estery and fruity, though surprisingly mild. 

Taste: Allagash is one of my favorite American breweries when it comes to making Belgian-style beers. Ironically enough, Ive never actually had their Dubbel Ale out of the bottle until now (I had it on tap at the brewery and it was excellent). The palette is fruity, sweet and slightly smoky. It reminds me a homebrew dubbel I made, actually. Anyway, the taste is fine  I get a distinct cherry flavor, some plum or other stone fruit, and maybe some fig. Theres a slightly soapy character from the yeast, as well as some smoke or dry astringency on the finish. I was hoping for something more robust, but this is fine.

Drinkability: While Allagash Dubbel meets the criteria for a big beer at 7% ABV, it definitely doesnt drink like something big at all. The mouthfeel is calm, though far from flat. The texture and finish is smooth with no alcohol warmth whatsoever. Theres not much in the way of aftertaste, which is nice since theres no cloying or drying sensation  but some residual flavor would be nice.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

This has always been poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a nice dark hazy brown color with a thin one finger white foamy head that dissipates within about a minute and leaves some light somewhat foamy lacing.
The smell started off with a light Belgian spice, bready yeastiness, light apples and then slightly shifts towards an earthy raisin quality.
The taste was sweet and spicy through the previously mentioned flavors. It left a long lingering sweet and spicy aftertaste which lead to the finish.
On the palate, this one sat at/about a medium in body. There was a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but still not bad for the style.
Overall, I say this was a good Dubbel. The best thing about it was the smell as it had a lot going on with it.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

584,"2013-01-22",3.8,"Reviewed 12/29/2012. 12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a gorgeous hazy amber color with a nice stream of carbonation rising up from the center. The head is a thick, frothy two finger offwhite color that retains itself quite well. As it slowly recedes, a beautiful but slight layer of lacing is left on the glass. This is everything a good dubbel should look like, period.

S: Classically bready, with a great balance between yeast and malts. Theres also a nice amount of candied sugar, apple, pear, and chocolate. While subtle, it gives off a nice vibe of apple pie.

T: Sweet sugars come first, before transitioning gradually into a neutral, bready finish. A little on the simple side, but the balance here is top caliber. A faint touch of hops give it a perfect amount of bitterness to neutralize the candied sugar. Given a chance to warm up, a modicum of complexity makes itself known - and its just enough to keep the beer interesting.

M: Clean, dry, and - dare I say - refreshing. Palate tingling astringency appears on the aftertaste, giving off said refreshment ability instead of weighing it down. A great beer to savor in spite of its initially light impression.

O: Really hard to complain about this one. This hits a nice balance between being clean and being complex. An excellent example of a subtle beer.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

584,"2012-09-28",3.9,"From Notes, 6/17/12:

Poured carefully from a 750ml corked & caged bottle into a Chimay goblet. Swirled yeast sediment for 2nd pour. Batch #94 indicated on the bottle. Found this sitting at room temp on a shelf in TX (Allagash pulled out ~1 yr ago.)

A: A deep amber color with lighter reddish oranges on the edge. Almost a finger of off-white head. Little to no lacing.

S: A bit muted, but I get caramel, brown sugar, and dark fruits.

T: Strong caramel, toasted grains, and brown sugar. The fruits seem to be plum and raisin. Slight tang of Belgian yeast. Very slight hop bitterness in the finish.

M: Medium carbonation, a bit chewy. Quite smooth.

O: Was worried about this sitting at room temp for so long, but I really enjoyed it. Id choose Chimay Red over this, but it was cool to get Allagash in Texas right now, especially a style that should hold up for a few years.","Austin, Texas, USA","videofrog"

A: Very slightly hazy mahogany body with a lot of fine carbonation particles in the body. A towering tan head sits on top leaving a huge mess on the glass as it dwindles away slowly.

S: Very odd smell here, its yeasty but I cant describe it. Very slight banana coming through, but not much else. Very boring aroma.

T: Semi-sweet malty body through to the finish where chocolate becomes apparent with a cherry and banana like ester finish with the chocolate. This is unlike any other dubbel Ive had, its not bad.

M: Creamy medium body.

O: Well this is interesting to say the least, it has hints of some dark fruits like cherries with the chocolate, its very subdued overall. I like this but I also wouldnt buy it again.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

584,"2012-03-01",3.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/18/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a chalice.

This pours an orange tinted brown color with a glorious 2 cm eggshell foam head. Great retention, and webs of lace are left down the side of the glass.

Brown sugar and well blended dark fruits control the nose, with just a little bit of spicy yeast in the back.

Either my taste buds have changed or this is just more subtle than the last time I had a dubbel. Brown sugar starts, with some light fig and plum flavors, and a clear clove yeast flavor pulls through. Not surprisingly, there is not a large hop presence, but a light spicy bitterness lingers.

The mouthfeel is creamy, with lightly bubbly carbonation setting the tone. Lightly grainy, with a medium to full body.

Im not sure if I want a more powerful flavor or not. Allagash always executes well, even if I dont agree with their intentions.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

S: Quite hoppy, despite the oak aging, with a nice citrus character and quite a bit of pine, too. Theres a very strong oak aroma which provides some sweet vanilla notes. A slight booziness along with a lot of sweet caramel and toffee.

T: The sweetness of the caramel and toffee flavors are on display from the beginning here. The hops are more toward the back end providing a piney bitterness. Lots of oak and vanilla (bourbon?) with just a touch of alcohol warmth.

Appearance: Pours a hazy dark caramel color with a 1 finger bubbly off-white head which dissipates fairly quickly. Decent amount of fine-bubbled lacing.

Smell: Light Belgian yeast with clove and some winter spices I dont normally associate with the style. The aroma is not as strong as I would have preferred.

Taste: Typical dubbel flavor of Belgian yeast up front followed by dried fruits in the middle and ending with a bit of bitter hops at the finish. Aftertaste is dry and mildly bitter.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Slightly above average drinkability. The alcohol is masked well, yet I wouldnt go back for another.

Maple and toffee mingle with brown spices, wood, and vanilla root. Her nose exudes supple warmth, a worthy compliment to succulent cooked red apples, pears, and prunes sprinkled with a none-too-shy helping of cinnamon fresh from the stick. Toasted sugars crunch, blending into wood, spice, and warmth. Smitten, I raise my chalice of swirling dark delights to eager lips which are met by a softly effervescent mouthfeel which belies a full body of chewy dark breads, prunes, and dark raisins. Despite her dark appearance, her palate shines with crunchy sugars atop toasted raisin bread which leads into a symphony of wood. Her finish is long, her warmth slowly but surely invading my chest and the back of my throat. If humans could purr in soulful satisfaction, my chest would be rumbling right now. Medium weight and a full palate keep my senses busy. As we spend more time together, a subtle dryness refreshes just in time for the next juicy quaff. A perfect merry-go-round of crunchy sweet, cooked fruits, dark fruits, toast, spice, and wood. Seeing as my Allagash Dubbel came in a magnificently corked 750ml bottle, I have another full glass to sit back and savor. Its a hard job, but somebody has to do it.

Since this rating was a solid 6+ years old, I figured Id use this bottle as an opportunity for an update:

Location: 750 ml bottle, 3/20/15, Batch #106


Aroma: The aroma is nuts and dark fruit with some underlying chocolate malts

Appearance: Pours a murky dark reddish color with a frothy beige head and mid-plus lace

Flavor: The flavor is along the same lines, fairly sweet, but not overly so, with a mild bitterness

Palate: The body is medium, heavy carbonation, with a lightly sticky finish

Overall Impression: 
It has certainly been a while since I have rated this beer, and probably a little while since Ive even had one.  This is a good beer.  Allagash knows how to make this style, and they do it well.

New Score: 3.7: 8/4/7/3/15


Location: Had this one out of a bottle at Bourbon in Adams Morgan, it wasnt the absolute best place to judge a beer (loud, dark, no glass)

I remember enjoying this one, a nice complex dubbel with some interesting flavors.  I will have to regrade next time I drink it if they conditions are more suitable to rating.

584,"2008-12-23",3.6,"75cl bottle.   My first Allagash beer, and a decent dubbel.   Good looking beer: a slightly hazy brown body with some red tint, covered by a big beige head.   Interesting spiced cake aroma with banana and citrus zest, maple and caramel, and plenty of yeast character.   The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly fruity, with some caramel and nutty malt.   The finish is mild to moderately bitter with some spicy hops, dry, and a bit light.   The body is light and airy.   this one definitely benefits from warming up a bit and releasing some of its ample carbonation.   Mixing the yeast in adds some more complex, nutty, woody flavors.   A bit subtle, but I really warmed up to this by the end.   Dubbel is a style that I don*t drink too often, but it*s what started me on Belgians in the beginning, and its always nice to find a new, solid example of the style.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

584,"2008-04-19",3.5,"Review from cvillebeergeek.com...

Appearance: Poured into my trusty Duvel tulip (hate the beer, love the glass), this beer exhibits a slightly cloudy ruby red color. The head is foamy and thick. Retention is moderate, as is the lacing. 4.0/5.0

Aroma: Batch 69 exhibits a fairly typical dubbel aroma. Strong yeast aromas with banana esters, nuts, toffee/caramel maltness and a nice fruitiness (honeydew?). This aroma is, as I said, fairly typical. It doesnt win any awards for originality, but it doesnt offend either. 3.5/5.0

Taste: Taste is a little more bitter than I expected. Not much fruitiness here, but there is breadiness, a little toffee, and a strong nuttiness. A little mocha as well. This has the beginnings of a typical abbey dubbel, but lacks the fruitiness and the sweetness most dubbels have. Very dry. 3.5/5.0

Mouthfeel: Effervesence level is good (something I can only dream of when I bottle my first homebrew in a couple of days). There is a smooth and creamy feel to the beer, despite is dryness, a hint that the carbonation level is spot on. 4.0/5.0

Drinkability: Alcohol by volume is 7%, according to the bottle. While for me this might qualify as a session beer, it does require a bit of caution for most. Alcohol is hidden fairly well, though it does make its presence known. This beer will probably offend the virgin palate, as will nearly all Belgian styles, but if your beer palate is just a little bit developed, this is a nice beer. 4.0/5.0

Overall: Not really the typical abbey dubbel experience, but it is a good example of a dry Belgian style beer. The yeast strain used is unmistakably Belgian, but beer definitely does its own thing. Im reminded of a time back in 2004, while campaigning for Howard Dean during the New Hampshire primaries, of being told that ""that treeline"" across a field from a high school in Somersworth was in Maine. Now, Ive never been to Maine. We tried, but Dover, New Hampshire, where we were based, seems to be a vortex and no matter what direction you go in, you end up right back downtown. So, we never made it to Maine, but we did meet a lot of Mainers, and Ive heard a lot about Maine culture since then. The point? When I imagine an abbey dubbel style ale combined with that Maine spirit, it would taste a lot like this beer. Its not a great example of a abbey dubbel, but it is an easy drinking, high quality beer. 3.8/5.0","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

584,"2007-12-27",2.1,"12 oz brown bottle. Aroma is a mild sweet well controlled hint of strong ale. Gunk on bottom of bottle provides for a swirling brown hazy pour, quite hypnotizing. Big initial alky content impact on the taste buds. More than I like for a Belgy.  This is what makes the american belgy styles so different than the real belgies, its the lack of refined smoothness.  I have yet to taste an american imitation of a belgy that is really civilized. Overall a little too strong on the alky character than I care for. Has a difficult time hiding the 7% and it leaves a lingering medicinal bite on the palate that hangs around for a while. This cannot hold a candle to Bornem Dubbel or Corsy Pater Brown.

584,"2007-10-11",3.3,"25.4 oz bottle courtesy of RSRIZZO-A cloudy dark amber body with a decent head that dissipated slowly into a covering of the beer. A faint aroma of malt and yeast. Taste of slight malt that builds up into more and more malt. Tastes more of an amber beer than a dubbel. I am getting no characteristics of a belgian beer. A little disappointed with this offering from Allagash. I was expecting more.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Headbanger"
584,"2007-10-08",3.2,"750 mL bottle.  Translucent orange-brown with a decent light beige head.  The aroma is mild, distinctly Belgian, and is dominated by caramel and fruity yeast.

Average; there are better examples of the style.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"

Crisp and minty flavor of very light malts and quiet yeast.  Mildly reminiscent of a date, fig and pecan trail mix with a quick temporanillo soak.  Copper and pears press with a slow, persistent gravity.  Finishes with a tinny canned pineapple sweetness, and minerals.  Palate is slightly thin and short on malt strength.  Smack of plain sugar and honey.  Consistent, and boring.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Strong coffee and toffee flavors.  The coffee may have been just a touch overdone, but it mellowed a bit as the beer warmed up.  A nice malty offering.  Recommended highly.

Batch #43

Allagash Dubbel Reserve poured a muddy murky garnet. Faint ruby highlights when held to the light along with some lively carbonation. 1 finger off white head formed on the pour and fell down to a cap with some thick islnds floating around. This beer looks really mysterious and murky, like its going to be packed with flavor. Leaves sheet lacing after each sip.

The nose on this beer is packed full of dark fruits. Plums and black cherries are present along with a sweet smell of candy sugars (?). Theres even some pear and fig. Mild doughy aroma as well. Loaded with malt and a slight mustiness showing up toward the back.

The taste is a little more subdued than the aroma. More doughiness which is quickly followed by all the dark fruits that were found in the aroma. Especially the plums and cherries. The musty earthiness shows itself on the swallow along with a mild bittersweet chocolate. Mild hop spiciness on the swallow.

Mouthfeel is the low point of this beer. The body is on the lighter side of medium but as it moves along my palate the body seems a little thinner than I would like it. 

This is an easy drinker. The flavors go so nice together its easy to drink this faster than you should.

This is a good quality dubbel from Allagash. The mouthfeel is the only thing lacking but thats just me being picky. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable beer.

As soon as I popped the cork, I could smell it, so I will start with the aroma: a nice mixture of sweet honey and plum or cherry. The aroma wasnt exceptionally strong, but still it smells very nice. It pours a slightly hazy auburn/brown, with a ton of soft sudsy tan foam. A lot of thick foamy lace remains on the the glass as I slowly savor the beer.

The first sip is quite sweet, with a mixture of maltiness, candi sugar, and a slight but thoroughly enjoyable graininess. There is a subtle aftertaste of light brown sugar and dark sweet Traverse City cherry. A nice residual bitterness and some more candi compete with each other to dominate the aftertaste. The bitterness wins, and as it turns out, the bitterness is like a strong black tea, lightly spicy. Im thinking it comes from both the grain and the hops.

Softly carbonated, the body is just a tad on the thin side. Nice Belgian character for a North American beer.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

Fore is nutty, yeasty and only mildly sweet. Has a muted honey flavor as well along with a dry peanut skin flavor and very ample liquor soaked bread notes.

UPDATE 11/6/09: The greatness that I found in that 750 ml bottle in 07 was not there in a couple of 12 oz. bottles I recently tried. Is the 12 oz. version inferior or is it something else? Certainly the appearance wasnt too remarkable this time around, and the aroma had some light hints of complexity, but again not too remarkable. The palate seemed thinner and drier. Finally the flavor just did not have near the richness or complexity. There were more hints of chocolate and red wine than I remember but there was also a troublesome phenolic quality. Not really bad but nowhere near the 4.3 I originally had. Seemed more like an average to even below average Belgian.

This was not a bad pickup.  it cost me about $1.80 as part of a mixed six pack
   at the local grocery store, along with a handful of other things Ive been
   meaning to try.  I would certainly consider picking it up again as it was a
   solidly made beer.  While not a standout in any way, it is well enough made
   to keep around as a daily drinker.
Aroma / Appearance - The half-finger bubbly head erupted over the body
   before settling back into the caramel brown body.  Carbonation was very
   active.  The nose was a nice mixture of caramel, wheat and cherries.  While
   not very complex, it gave a clear sense of what to expect.
Flavor / Palate - Wheat, cherries and a mild bitterness highlight the
   experience in many of the sips.  Eventually a chocolately mouthfeel formed
   as it began to coat my tastebuds.  The body was a little watery but still
   satisfying with some malt in evidence.  This would be nice for a summer day

I have one of the reserves aging in the cellar.  Cloudy dark amber.  1+cm. foamy light tan head.  Drops quickly.  Thin layer of foam and some bubbles stick around.  Really good lacing.  Aroma - nice belgian dubbel aroma.  Not overbearing, but substantial.  Little banana, cloves, and belgian yeast spice witha  a little bit of a sweet malty background.  Sweetness comes out more as it warms.  Flavor - High, sharp bitterness up front and through the middle.  Some classic dubbel flavors in the finish - banana, cloves, spicy peppery bitterness, and a little yeast character.  Flavor is not overbearingly strong, but its there.  More sweetness and balance as it warms.  Palate - solid medium.  Sharp bitterness lightens it a little bit.  Overall - Id say an avg. dubbel.  Good flavor that isnt too strong, but a little too bitter, and not quite as sweet as Id like.  Good though, and Id buy it regularly if it was available to me.  Liked it more and more as it warmed.  Really need to plan better to rate belgians warmer.","USA","WhiteSoxFan"

584,"2006-01-27",4.7,"The Reserve line of Allagash beers are packaged in 750ml corked brown bottles, that are sedimented with yeast, so a secondary fermentation can occur, so these beers can be cellared, and matured for years. Currently available in my market are the Dubble Reserve, and Triple Reserve. Last night I enjoyed a bottle of their Dubble Reserve (Batch #27) for the first time in a couple of years, and it was as fantastic as I remember(I had picked up the Triple Reserve on a recent trip to Maine). This beer is styled after a classic Trappist dubble, and uses an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Dubbles are malty, spicy brews, with complex flavors, aromas, and a soothing, warming burn. Allagash Dubble Reserve comes in at 7% abv. 

Allagash Dubble Reserve pours to a deep mahogany color with a thick and rocky white head, and a vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is very complex and inviting. Aromas of sweet malt, peppery alcohol, hints of dark chocolate and nuts, marry with spicy/yeasty aromas. The palate is firm with lots of really good sweet and candy malt flavors that coat the tongue. This is paired with a back drop of flavors of raisin, and chocolate. Allagash Dubble finishes with more complex malty and yeasty flavors up front, then ends with a sweet malty, and slightly warming alcohol burn. 

This is an outstanding domestic version of a classic Trappist dubble. This beer would match well with a number of heart dishes, such as beef stew, or a roasted leg of lamb. It would also make an excellent desert beer, and would work well with chocolate deserts. I love to savor a beer like this, and enjoy its complex flavors, so I usually do not pair it with food. At $4-$5 a 750ml bottle, it is very fairly priced as well. This beer can be consumed young, or cellared for a number of years, and will improve with some age. If this beer, or any of the Allagash beers in the classic or reserve line, are available in your market, seek them out. They are some of the finest domestic examples of Belgian beer styles on the market today.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

584,"2005-05-25",4.0,"batch #44 750ml corked bottle.  This cork popped with a defining explosion-almost like a gunshot!  pours a deep ruby burgandy hue with a nice foamy peach colored head.  nice malty, caramel, slight brett, candy sugar, dark fruits, estery/yeasty aroma.  this definately smells like an american version of a belgian classic.  This is far different than say the westmalle dubbel.  Lots going on in the flavor-starts estery/fruity with touches of citrus, dark fruit, and finishes more akin to an american amber ale (caramel, earthy with some belgian character as well).  when cold, the palate was a little raw, but opened up more as it warmed.  The finish dries out substantially as the beer warms.  There is a fair amount of bitterness here from both a hop touch and robust malting. Some interesting cheese notes on the finish that were very nice.   I think this beer would take on more belgian character as it aged, but i think its damn good right now-could be my fav dubbel.

584,"2004-08-16",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 Batch #41.  Pours a soft and somewhat dull brownish-tan.  Good amount of charred white head, lots of it.  Aroma of cedar, cola, vinegar, tart prunes and raisins. Tons of yeast character both in the aroma and in the actual appearance, well conditioned.  Flavor has a dry and extremely yeasty profile.  Light tart vinegar/fruit notes, lots of cherry cola and hints of bubble gum.  Finishes with a yeasty nuttiness, chewy and thick.  Body is medium-full, leaves a light chocolate flavor on the palate.  I found this one to be delicious.   Batch #44. Blind dubbel tasting  Aroma has plenty of yeast, light tart fruit tones, a bit more of a dusty yeastiness.  Flavor is drier than I remember at first, with less overall character, but as I let it breath and warm, more sweet brown sugar-like malt appears, the yeast character remains huge and there is a light mix of chocolate and cherry cola on the finish.  Carbonation is soft but evident, creating a pleasing texture.  Yeast very profound.  You wont confuse this one for a cheap American imitation dubbel.  Interesting take, with the unique wood character quite apparent.Earlier Rating: 6/13/2004 Total Score: 3.82004 bottle sampled in the summer 2004.  Good deep brown, caramel and walnut colored.  Good mocha flecked light brown head but unfortunately not bottle conditioned (that I can tell).  Aroma of yeast, caramel and some light chocolate fudge notes.  Big yeast smell as well.  Seems a bit lifeless and stale from the filtration, but the flavors are true enough.  Caramel, quite dry malting, with light hops and a finishing nuttiness with plenty of yeast in there.  Well done beer, not terribly adventurous, but just good and drinkable.  Alcohol is masked wonderfully.  Wood like to see some more dark fruits in there.  Slight bubble gum tinge to it though, so that was nice.  Mouthfeel is chewy, lightly thin as it has warmed, but pretty solid with a medium body.  6/4/7/3/142005 draught at the Great Lost Bear, with Muzzlehatch on 5/21/2005.  This stuff was killer on draught, far better than I remembered from the bottle.  Complex brown malts waft from the glass, with light earthy spices, smooth yeast and chocolate.  Flavor has light candi sugar, plenty of yeastiness, with biscuits, graham crackers, chocolate pie crusts and caramel syrup drizzled on top.  Quite decadent, shall I suggest, ""a dessert beer""?  Whatever the case, it was fantastic, with a medium-full body, no wateriness or thinning and a very low amount of carbonation.

I was afraid this would turn out like the Ommegang: Dry, too heavy and the alcohol was not backed by anything but a very awful malty dryness. This however was a work of art! Beautiful color. Dark dark deep garnet hue with a nice frothy head that dissipates and leaves a continent. Aroma is a dead ringer for either a chimay bleu or rouge, take your pick. Perhaps a little more nutty and less fruity. Notes of citrus, chocolate, and sweet notes of both brown sugar and yeasty belgium love. Flavor is excellent. The brew starts very sweet this fades into the carbonation and the yeast takes over flattening out the sweetnes in conjunction with the hops. The bitternes is very appetizing. Overall an excellent brew and impressive to me at least that it comes out of America.

 TAR claims that there are few beers better than aged Allagash. Well I let this beer sit longer than any other beer ever, almost 12 months… so lets see what has produced.
 Pours a very rich effervescent mahogany body with a thick caramel tinted head. The aroma is and earthy and fruity malt and yeast. Strong notes of toffee and caramel… plums and figs stand out, a note of clove and coriander cut in on the dance, then a nutty cashew likeness. The flavor brings more lovely maltyness, maybe some sage and oak renderings… very mellow and wispy palate.

584,"2004-02-04",3.4,"Batch # 38  This beer presents a copper body with orange hues and a full rocky light tan head. The aroma is sweet ripe fruit, plums, and caramel. The flavor is roasted nutty malt with only a little bit of sweetness. There is a slightly harsh astringency that develops about mid-swallow. The finish however is pleasing. Medium dry body with a long lingering roasted finish. Not nearly as good as the Tripel.Earlier Rating: 11/5/2003 Total Score: 3Hazy ruby color. Very quickly diminishing off-white head. Aroma is almost like a brown ale. Nuts and roasting orange rind are predominant. Flavor is also a lot like a brown ale, but has a more yeasty complexity to it. The aftertaste is almost exactly like a brown. I am confused. Somewhat sweet and more hoppy then expected. Body is medium and the finish is fairly dry. Overall not bad, but this beer is very confused as to its style, in fact so I am.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

I agree with urbnhauste that the finish realy detracts from the beer, I wouldnt quite call it terribly sour, but its too bitter and slightly sour and realy kills the nice sweet maltieness that you hope will last longer than it does. I finished this beer while eating a bannana, and the two blended beautifuly. It realy helped to overcome the bitter finish. This beer wants to break the 4.0 barrier but even with the help pf the bannana the bitter/sour finish just wont let it happen.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","ToadMan"

584,"2003-07-02",3.8,"This Belgian style double ale has a small, off-white head that sits upon a nice, dark, reddish amber body. The head does not linger long, but enough is left to leave some lacings. The aroma is lightly spicy and yeasty with a touch of malt sweetness. It has a medium body with light carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is malty and lightly spicy with hints of ginger and orange. The finish is long and malty sweet with some yeastiness and a very mild bitterness. Not as refined as the Dubbel Reserve from Allagash, but still a very nice and drinkable double.

Malts dominate the aroma catagory on this beer, with subtle hints of hops in the background. Very malty tasting as well, not much bitterness here from hops. More like a dunkle in my book.
Very sweet, coating the tongue with a syrup like consistency also.
Alcohol tastes prevalent as well. Finishes very sweet as well. I'm glad I tasted this beer at the festival, because it's too sweet for my liking, so I won't be buying this again.","","Cobra"
584,"2003-06-25",4.4,"What a wild color this stuff pours out, it looks like darkly varnished cherrywood and the head is amazingly huge, two fingers high of tannish, fluffy whipped cream, crusty even with large pockets and divets, and it rains curtains of lace with some sticking in strings and ink-blot patches.
Aroma is quite nice with a big spicy, citrusy, orangy floral hop up front and sweet with toffee, dark fruit, and breadish notes.
Taste is spicy of orange peel and hops up front, goes super yummy smooth with great balance of malty richness. Some of the mellowing out through the middle and end has some dry dark fruits and yeast of bread lingers. Warms of alcohol a bit after a few sips. Quite complex and firmly held in its balance.
Feel is pretty close to full-medium body, firm and mellowing warm with all sorts of spicy and drying things going on.
I haven't had many dubbles, so my thoughts are quite high on this. But in that regards, no matter what, its a very darn good and drinkable dubble. Smooth and a bit sneaky, always a good feature to have in any beer.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

584,"2003-05-26",3.9,"If you've read a bunch of my reviews, you know that I really love Allagash. I've had just about every one of their beers and loved every one. I shared a bottle of this with my friend and was pretty impressed. It was purchased at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, New York : Batch #34. Great dark hazy colour of dark reds and browns. The head was very subdued with a slight tan head. The smell was a little subtle bringing a bunch of malt and barley into the nose. The taste was pretty good, good strong taste with the malt and barley shown through most. No noticable hop presence and no outstanding fruit or lighter flavours. It was a great beer none-the-less, but actually one of my least favourite Allagash beers. As I told my friend, it was too bad we sampled this after the Victory V-12, as this one was much 'less' of a beer than the V-12, but it was still very worthy. I'm looking forward to my last Allagash (except for the Bruin), the Speciale Reserve. What a great way to have Beer #300 while still being only 21!

Sure its an off the wall Belgian Double but age this and see how drastically it changes.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
584,"2002-07-13",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 25, 2016 Bottle (750mL, bottled Jan 2016).

Head is initially large, frothy/creamy, light brown, fully lasting.
Body is hazy medium to dark amber.

Aroma is moderately malty (nuts, cookie, caramel, toasted bread), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of second-flush Darjeeling tea (muscat grape, tobacco, wet autumn leaves), gum, orange zest.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Not quite the blockbuster that the Tripel is, but a very solid, authentic, and enjoyable rendition with no real weak points. Hope to revisit someday with a fresher sample, which could very well propel it to a 4.0-4.2 score. Only thing keeping it from a 4.0 as-is is that the acidity is just a bit stronger than I would like.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

May 2005 Draught pint sampled at Great Lost Bear in Portland ME with the illuminating and ruminating ClarkVV.

This brew did not have the typical belgian complexity, probably because it is not really a belgian ale, but in the Belgian style.

584,"2002-04-22",3.9,"Batch 28: Pleasant enough.  The color is deep, ruddy amber.  The aroma is wonderful -- a mild bubble-gum (the gum you used to get on halloween -- the hard, individually wrapped ones).  The flavor is pleasantly sweet with a balancing bitter.

584,"2002-04-16",4.4,"Batch 24: A great one, from nose to finish. The nose is Bretty, deep dark and mysterious, with pepper and fruit; intense. The head was large and rocky and sustained. The flavors were all Allagash, as far as I can tell; restrained sweetness, bitterness and pepperiness at the end, deeply rich malt. Yum. Thanks Jayme, again.Earlier Rating: 3/25/2002 Total Score: 3.7To my nose, this nears the complex aromas of the belgians. Bretty yeastiness, malty, tart aroma. Thin head, but lasts. Has a thin body ala La Trappe Dubbel (and some others), but tarter, more citric, a tad smoky. Quite dry, almost mouth-puckering. Long long bitter, dry, sour finish. Not at all what I was expecting in any aspect. One hair more fruity sweetness + somewhat less carbonation + a bit more of the same malt and hop flavor balance would make this a master double in my book.

584,"2002-03-19",4.4,"Batch #10.  Very malty arora, huge creamy head which nearly overflowed my Orval glass, from which I drank this brew.  Im baffled at some people commenting that it was weak on the malts.  I found the malt flavor to be very strong, but not quite to the level of a Doppelbock.  This beer finishes dry.
