1555,"2011-05-25",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2013 This was a tasting of Blue Label Mu 青乃無, made in Hyogo. Crystal clear. Sweet, fruity, mellow and round sake, with peaches and melon in the nose and a dry, peppery, spicy finish. Huge, rich, flavor--she told me it was dry, but that was the finish, big sweet, fruity lusciousness up until then. Great full body. Good stuff.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1555,"2010-12-31",4.0,"300ml bottle. Clear, but with a slight yellow tint. No legs. Aroma is a melony sweet alcohol. Flavor follows with more fruit. Body is slightly thick and finishes crisp. Paired with with some pear, which was nice. And the bottle looks good too :)","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
1555,"2010-12-30",3.4,"Tap a decibel in nyc.  Clear in color, what else would it be?  Earthy stone fruit, alcohol.  Pear, apple, earth, and alcohol on the flavor.   A little boozy with medium body.  A good sake I think.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
1555,"2009-08-16",3.7,"Bottle shared by Eric. Now Ive had plenty of Sake when I lived in Japan, but I never really liked it much- or at least not as much as beer. But I am branching out, and this quality brew was very nice. Pours a crystal clear color. The aroma and the flavor were dominated by sweet apples and pear. It was very oily and flavorful. Quite nice. Very warm as Sake tends to be. I am really not qualified to rate a Sake, but I will re-rate all of my early tries later when I hopefully know more.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1555,"2009-08-02",4.0,"Bottle thanks to tytoanderso, I have now found this available at local stores. Pours clear and water like hue, very pure, with strongish legs. Aroma of vanilla almond, pear, melon, koji, butter and higher sweetness than a +2 would have you believe. Quite clean and pure smelling.  Taste is nice, sweet and pure. Excellently balanced. With notes of nuts, vanilla, light umami, rose petals, lychee and concord grapes. Very nice and extremely light alcohol presence (btw, my bottle read 15%, not 16.5%). Viscous and full bodied, yet refreshing. Very, very pleasant.

Paired exceptionally with cavaillon melon.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1555,"2009-06-06",3.7,"Shiny clear nail polish shine, Nose of some funk, wormy soil, paint thinner, and vivid pear. Thick mouth with some hotness but smooth overall. soft, velvety fruits over comforting sweetness.  slight funky bite in the finish but mostly faint and smooth tail, huge warming effect though.  Flavors of pear and cantaloupe mostly.  Not mind blowingly complex, but certainly not mundane.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1555,"2008-01-23",4.1,"Clear body with a strong sweet fruity nose.  Sweet fruity body with hints of pear.  From a flight at the UMI Sake house.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
1555,"2007-10-08",4.0,"Very pretty aroma. Bananas, plums, sweet rice pudding, tapioca. Pours pale gold leaving rich, oily legs down the glass. Flavor was drier than the sweet nose lets on. Some tropical fruit notes. Meduim to full bodied. Very rich and creamy. Nice sake for sure!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
1555,"2007-09-05",4.3,"Bottle: Pours a crystal clear color with light legs but a shimmering character. The nose is bright and fruity, lots of pear and anise, some alcohol and light coconut. The flavor is sweet and full bodied, nice bouquet, perfectly balanced, buttery and full. The quintessential sake by my litmus test. Quite! +2? Ok.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
