2677,"2016-09-14",4.0,"Bottle. Almost black with a light tan head. More than plenty of bourbon in the aroma with rich toffee, stollen, some mocha, oak. Silky texture thats rather lighter than expected. Lowish carbonation. Sweet but well short of cloying,perhaps partly due to distinct bitterness and some booze at the end. Stollen, layers of toffee, oak, cocoa. Deep but agreeably balanced and drinkable. Very good but wildly expensive (in Australia).","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

2677,"2016-03-07",3.9,"Type: 750-ml bottle (25.4 oz.0
Glass: AleSmith Barrel-Aged Reserve snifter glass 
From: Costco in Mission Valley (San Diego), Calif.
Price: $14.99
Purchased: Feb. 25, 2016
Consumed: March 3, 2016
Misc.: Bottled in Sept. 2015; Cork and cage top; Reviewing as an American Strong Ale

To say I was excited about this one might have been the understatement of the.. time being. First of all, I had never heard of this beer (or the Trip in the Woods series). Second, I really dug the original Maillards Odyssey in the Beer Across America variety pack. Third, its Sierra Nevada, so it has to be good. Fourth, its a 750-ml bottle (25.4 oz.). And finally, it was purchased at Costco, so a good deal (still $14.99) was made.

Poured a black color with 2-to-3 fingers of fluffy, tan head. Good sporadic foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled woody oak, bourbon barrel, smooth toffee, buttery caramel, Nugget hops (probably the wood), milk chocolate, vanilla, honey, molasses and hints of licorice. Got much better as it went down, reminding me of a hoppy imperial stout. (Smell - 4.25)

Taste followed the nose. Got smooth bourbon to start, woody oak, caramel, toffee, honey, vanilla, molasses, faint wet tobacco, milk chocolate, boozy at times, chocolate syrup, maple walnut, toasted pecan, butterscotch and buttery malts. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.50)

This was just tremendous. Kept reminding me of an Imperial Stout, but its an American Strong Ale. Really liked it. (Overall - 4.25)

2677,"2016-03-05",4.4,"Black color. Head is thick and frothy that is tan colored. Lacing is awesome. Solid completely around the glass. Aroma is of bourbon, cherries, chocolate, vanilla, toast and coffee. To me i think the bourbon is well hidden. It feels fluffy on the palate. Very soft mouthfeel. Taste like a dark chocolate reeses peanut butter cup. Does seem to warm the insides a little. Wish the finish wasnt so abrupt. Still a very good beer.

2677,"2016-02-13",4.8,"750 ml corked and caged bottle; 9.3% ABV. Aroma is toasted coconut, wood, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, licorice, wet river rock; standard for quality barrel-aged beers, but theres nothing wrong with that. Pours black with a one finger tan head with good retention; laces some. Taste is lightly sweet--not too sticky--dry and faintly bitter in the finish; flavors of the deScriptors, along with leather, tobacco. The bourbon is at just the right level in both aroma and flavor; its not overpowering, but its noticeable. The body seems thinner than I expect from a beer like this, but I really dont mind. It makes it that much more drinkable and more than just a sipper. Its so smooth. Wow, Im really impressed with this. I honestly wasnt expecting too much, given that the non-barrel aged version from Beer Camp was pretty mediocre and Ive been getting a little burnt out on beers like this, but this is just awesome. I had the score at 4.9, then I got to thinking of other beers Ive given that score to, like a couple Firestone Walker Anniversary beers and Fremont Coffee Cinnamon Abominable. Its not quite as good as those beers, but its in reaching distance I think.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

Aroma is chocolate with caramel and toffee. Lighter roast and toasted bread notes. Some medium light bourbon and light oak. Hints of vanilla and nuts. Medium light to light fruit notes of prunes, plums and black cherry. 
Pours black with a large, thick mocha head that slowly, but steadily recedes. Medium lacing and moderately long legs. 
Flavor has a moderate sweetness with a lot of nice chocolate notes. Some good, balanced roast note with a real coffee character to it. Medium light bourbon notes with a hint of oak, vanilla and nuts. Light dark fruit notes. Medium bitterness. Hints of leather and tobacco. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a very tasty, well balanced stout. This lacks all the fancy hype that other barrel aged stouts get, but its very solid. Could perhaps be a touch bigger with a chewier mouthfeel, but on the whole this is a very nice stout and better than a lot of the hyped ones out there.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

The aroma is full of charred oak and roasted malt. There is a little booze. A dark fruit is present as is a nice molasses. The flavor is similar. More base malts and a booziness. The heat is a little surprising to dominate, since it was harder to pick up in the nose. Wet oak is very prevalent. A light char and a decent molasses carry it out. The mouth feel is thinner, but well carbonated. The aftertaste is all barrel and lingers for a while. Could be a lot better.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
