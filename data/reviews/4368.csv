4368,"2014-02-26",4.2,"22oz bottle. No date. I assume fresh, because it was from the first round of distribution to SF. Served chilled and let come up in temp. Guinness glass. Deep, dark brown pour, with a thin khaki head. Focused aromas of chocolate, roasted nuts and roasted grain, with a hint of sweet, smoky, charr. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, full and round, with a medium-light lager weight. Very friendly, with a very slight, dusty bitterness. Flavors of dark chocolate, subtle raisins, mild sweet smoke, ash and roasted grain. Great lingering flavors of dark chocolate, roasted grain and mildly sweet smoke. Overall, wonderful balance and mouthfeel, with good balanced flavors of mainly chocolate and sweet smoke. While I don't have much experience with Schwarz style lagers, this was very enjoyable. Light smoke is very well integrated. While it drinks fine chilled, I enjoyed it more near 60-65 degrees. I can only imagine this will go well with the right foods.

Silky mouthfeel. Delicious roasted malt, light mineral, light caramel, chocolate, dry herbal flavor.

4368,"2013-05-09",3.4,"In short: A very soft black lager.  Clean and well-made but without oomph.
How: Bottle 22oz, consumed approximately one month after purchase, bottle sent to me by mcberko, thanks a lot Matt.
The look: Near black body with ruby highlights topped by a beige ring of foam.
In long: Nose is soft roast, herbal and green grass sensation.  Taste has milk chocolate (really milky sensation here), medium roast, whole-wheat bread, soft black liquorice candy, fresh tobacco leafs.  Very mild bitterness.  This is a very smooth beer, very good but maybe a little too smooth even for the session beer lover that I am.  Lacks that something-special that most other Heater Allen beers have.  A bit of a disappointment coming from the USA lager masters, but I liked it, because I love beer, most of my days are spent either obsessing about all the beers I want to drink or wondering what color of scarf Johnny Depp is wearing, and my therapist is not sure which of these two problems we should address first.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Flavor also has a rich and earthy umami quality.  Body is thin, carb is soft, and abundant roasted dryness leads toward a lightly bitter, smoke-kissed finish.  The light body, ample roast, and smoky dryness stunningly complements something like a rich chocolate ganache dessert.  At 4.8%, you CAN have it with dessert because it is not already one in itself.

Quite a bit of hops come through in the finish. Palate is fairly smooth, but feels a bit thin. Some of the Czech tmavy schwarzbier’s that I’ve had built up more of a warm caramel flavor to them, I really enjoy that character, but this didn’t seem to find that, siding more towards the porter realm with a roasty chocolate dominate flavor.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
