2943,"2017-01-30",3.8,"On tap at Chucks on 85th, pours a clear pale blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out notes of honey and acidic red apples. Flavour is huge, with honey, red apples and intense acidity. Wonderful blend of mead and cider. Finishes acidity and boozy, but in the best of ways. Very good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2943,"2016-12-09",3.7,"Aroma is strong whiskey/liquor and apples. The flavor is whiskey/liquor, apples, tart/sweet in the middle and an alcoholic/slightly burning finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
2943,"2016-11-28",4.0,"It pours dull golden orange with no head. The aroma has rich sweetness which is presumably from apples and honey,, both of which are there. Theres is a distinct booziness asking with oak, vanilla, grainy wood and pears. It has a full slick body with no carbonation and a creamy velvety feel. The taste is very deceptive with the alcohol, just a mere hint on the finish. The gate has honey and rich apples, but there is also a raspberry taste and lots of vanilla, traces of caramel and some peppery spice. Very nicely made.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2943,"2016-11-10",3.5,"Can from a Lazy Dog
Slightly hazy light golden color with no head, not sure if this is supposed to be carbonated but this can was flat. Sweet syrupy apple with bit of brown sugar and a light woody oak. Pretty decent cider.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
2943,"2016-03-31",3.6,"Draft at Black Squirrel. Hazy pale yellow color. Aroma of floral apple. Taste is sweet spiced herbal apple, dryish finish. Nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2943,"2015-12-25",3.6,"On draught. 
Pours a pale golden & is basically still. 

Teh aroma has some wood & baking spice. Its only lightly sweet smelling and has some light tart apples and a nice honey character. 

The flavor is spicy and plesantly sweet. Its got tart apples and a nice bitter apple rind character. The booziness is warming and it gives the mead a sort of brandy like character.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2943,"2015-10-16",3.9,"Draft to stemmed wine glass. This is an apple mead, so Im not sure if. It should be categorized as cider (which it currently is) or a mead. Looks good for the style; a transparent gold with some light carbonation that fades fairly quickly after the pour. Some bubbly white lacing as well. Smells solid; a nice mix of tart apples and honey. Tastes like it smells, but richer, with more of a honey presence alongside soft notes of vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium full-bodied and smooth, especially for the abv. Tasty stuff that drinks more like a mead than a cider.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

2943,"2015-10-01",3.6,"Very tiny bubbles, burnt orange color. No head. Theres a lot of baked apple here. and honestly that 13% ABV is so well hidden. I cant believe its not mead! Very interesting. pear juice, some cherry hidden away and a lot of sweetness. almost cloying but impressively crafted.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

2943,"2015-07-20",2.5,"On tap @ Haven Gastropub. Clear straw color with some short lived white foam. Sweet and syrupy all the way through. Maybe some honey and apple pie filling. A touch of bitter dry spices and apple skins. Comes off as a bit grainy to me. No real acidity or balance. Boozy. Goopy.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
