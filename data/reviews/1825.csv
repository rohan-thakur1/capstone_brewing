1825,"2012-01-17",3.4,"In short: A big heavy sweet dark beer like many others.  Good.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed probably fresh, 6 months after first bottle rating
The look: Black body topped by medium beige head with medium retention
In long: Nose is big fat roasted malts, peat, light smoky notes.  Tastes is chocolate fudge, peat, roast, a shot of a quality pale single malt Scotch, burnt brown sugar, waffles, note of smoked wood.  Not much hops to speak of.  High sweetness sensation.  Big full body with appropriate medium carbonation.  A decent beer, but a bit too heavy for its own good, a single 500ml bottle was more than enough for me.  This is a nice big sweet heavy beer but it doesnt really stand out.  Not a bad beer at all but when considering the hefty price tag I regret purchasing this one.  I need to be more selective when buying pricey beer bottles, I think I need more discipline, and I dont mean the spanking kind, however if you know someone offering this service please beermail me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
