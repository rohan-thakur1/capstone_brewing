344,"2017-06-16",3.5,"Aroma sour, green fruit, very strong. Smell of apple fills the room. 
Hazy yellow with small bobbles, and a hugh white head that disappear quickly. 
Extremely sour and acidic , with a taste of apple, quite unlike anything Ive ever had. Taste more like a sparkling wine, then a beer. But without any bad aftertaste. Carbonation is spot on. Basically no hop taste and as powerful it is in the front of the mouth, there is not much in the back. 
Not my taste, guess Ill have to revisit, when Im more familiar with lambics.","DENMARK","Offar"

344,"2016-08-16",4.6,"375 mL bottle. Bottled 11/18/2010. Originally reviewed 9/5/2011. As soon as the cage was untwisted, the cork shot out of the top and hit the ceiling. Nice.

Golden straw body with lively bubbles. Huge head that almost overflows my glass. The head is also lively and eventually dies down to a nice pillow of foam. Perfect look for a beer.

Smell has tons of funk. Definitely more prevalent than the sour smells, which are hardly present. The tartness is more of an acidity that pierces through the funky hay smells.

Taste is much like the aroma, the tartness is not on display. Its the funk. Great grassy and woody flavors intermingled with acidic sourness. The finish has a peppery oak finish that comes off as the slightest bit bitter.

A little heavy fresh, considering how effervescent the flavors are. Not really dry at all, which is what I expected. Strong carbonation, which does help alleviate the weight of the beer. With some age, this beer dries out, cutting much of the sweetness.

Flavor / Palate - Vinegary cheese tickles the tongue. Tart, acidic, and in your face, the profile bites back as it cleans the palate. Lemony textures round out a top notch beer that I wish I could have on hand all the time.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

344,"2016-03-18",5.0,"Oh mighty mighty Geuze - its nice to know something so funky is still made in the old way well into the 21st century. Ive tried to turn a few new-world beer dorks onto the stuff and they mimic Brando (""the horror, the horror""....) but still I loved the damned stuff. It costs a small fortune over on the North American continent but usually worth every penny to get it the proper Belgian way. As for this stuff, I feel like Im in no position to judge - the head is perfect, the body and carbonation is perfect. That aroma of barn funk, sour hay, donkey hair and fermented lemon juice will be a symphony to a geuze fan, or a horrible stench to everyone else. The flavour is light and dry yet resonates. This is textbook perfect and Im going to give it a perfect score, only the second in all my 6 years of rating beer (or more than that? I cant remember, Im drunk).

It has a hard-to-describe sweet-fruity flavor going through it, I dunno, sweet/bitter oranges peels kind of approximate it, but theres some of the ""belgian"" and earthy in it as well. Some call it funk. Most of sourness lets up by the finish, leaving a slightly malty, dry aftertaste, I think I can actually discern some hops in it too. And near the end it actually gets somewhat bitter, very grapefruity kind of bitter. Its light, highly carbonated, and even despite its monstrous acidity, its very drinkble.

I get oak, lemon, tartness, tangy pineapple and a dash of white pepper and even fresh peaches in the finish. Lovely.

Preparation: Fridged bottle, popped at 10°C -12°C (within recommended temperature of 14°C) onto a dimple.

Looks: Translucent orange honey colour with a small nob of yeast sedimentsHalf finger head with crumpety white foams which last for 1 minute; Fair sticky lacing with active, slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and tart aroma of malt, with red wine, strong vinegar, strong funk, strong yoghurt, wood barrel, champagne, light grape skins, lemon and thin grass.

Taste: Strong sour taste of malt, with strong funk, strong grape skins, moderate vinegar, yoghurt, cider alcohol, wood barrels, liquorices, lemon, strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Close to light body. Thin and dry palate.

Mouth Feel: Very strong astringent red grape skins and barnyard upfront, with underlying yoghurt and vinegar slowly come through. Then comes strong cider booze, barrels, liquorces, and strong lemon to close. Different from most Gueuze with strong Balsamic character, but still very layered and pretty nice nevertheless.

Hoppiness / Tannic: Lemon and thin grass in nose. Strong lemon, very astringent grape skin some tannic in taste. Bitterness is strong, for a lasting, high astringent fruit peels tart finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Funky, viney and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one is a class on its own with unique taste, quite standoff-ish with so few Balsamic and white wine taste, but infused with strong grape skins, cider booze and liquorices. Funky and lemony, just imagine this is almost like a Gueuze version of craft IPA. Enjoyable but not as hearty and wholesome as I wished.

Slightly hazy, deep and warm orangey blonde, cloudy but still warm and pretty with deposit; irregular, yellowish white head with good lacing and decent retention. Classic, strong lambic aroma: spritzy lemon zest, sour cream, leathery horseblanket, starfruit, oaky tannins, a delicate and refined, floral sweetness (rose petals, even acacia honey), hints of red wine vinegar, cava, fresh pineapple, moist wood, gooseberries, apple peel... Very crisp and refreshing onset, acid but still elegant, lemony, bit astringent as it should be, estery but in a very balanced, noble way, with a subdued fruity sweetness underlying the acidity; spritzy, champagne-like carbo, minerals, deeper lactic tartness in great balance with the more impetuous citric acidity, bready and wheaty background, long dry finish with continuing carbonation, very stimulant and satisfying, with a beautifully balanced woodiness and a hint of soft, leafy hop bitterishness in the end; sour berry and lemon acidity cleans the back of the mouth and throat without becoming overly biting; the overall result is simply mouth-watering. This is a world classic in sour beers, tastes just as perfect, balanced and quenching as ten years ago; in spite of the variations in the lambics used since then, it has managed to maintain its own personality among oude geuzes.

The taste blended all of the previously mentioned characters to a slight sour but allowed a decent tart citrus fruitiness to blend really nicely. The aftertaste was subtle and had a light citrus to it.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body. If it was Summer, I probably would have pounded the whole thing within two gulps. Holy sessionable feel. The carbonation seemed to be there but felt nicely.

The finish is rather short though. Very good and easier to drink as youd expect. Also had younger ones (for instance, a 30/10/2013 in February 2015) - sweeter, with a nice body.
And, finally, on February 22th, 2015, I had a 06/12/1997 at the 3 Fonteinen Café. Damn. So full of character and much milder. Very complex and gains a lot with decanting. Everybody loved it.

Several 2013-03-26 bottles. Black bread and rubber, but good complexity and very good at 2 yrs old. Quite refined. Just a classic.2003-02-12 bottle at Akkurat.

344,"2014-01-02",5.0,"UPDATED: FEB 16, 2016 3 fonteinen Oude Geuze, bottled 11/03/2015

Pours a vibrant straw-golden color, with an unusual huge head for a Gueuze, which even leaves back thick sheets of lacing after collapsing noisily.

This is just the best smelling Gueuze out there. This is true for its balance, its complexity and its specific house profile on the nose. Lots of apple peel and almost juicy, crisp citrus peel blend into moldy earth, cream cheese, grape skin, and a profound tartness, which provides a sweet, fruity peak. Dried, dusty wood sets the foundation for these aromas, together with a sparkly mineralic quality, creating an intriguing freshness to the otherwise outstandingly funky beer.

Tastes smooth from the beginning, while evolving a bubbly, spritzy carbonation after the swallow, which builds up an astonishing depth of flavors, with a clean, sour, refreshing finish. Drinks very easy, once accustomed to the intense sourness, with a flavor intensity I have never found in another 6 abv beer yet.

Tastes of citrus pulp, apple pith, lemon zest, wet hay and a mineralic quality. As the beers sourness evolves to an even more pungent state, a balancing, wood bark embraced maltiness comes up, leading the sourness gently over the palate. Herbs, blue cheese, leaves, salty, wet stones and soft wheat enrich the body of the beer, which doubtlessly remains focussed on its world class sourness. Finishes with more wood, spruce, humid earth, fermented apple and a funkiness, which tickles my tongue, leading to a pleasant, clean citrus ending.

While this is never exactly the same beer, you can always be sure to be drinking one of the best beers Belgium has to offer. No additional cellaring required, this is perfect when it gets released. Incredibly complex and well composed, the more you drink it, the more nuances you will discover. Another quality which stands out, the beer pairs really good to a lot of food: moussels, fish and pork will benefit from this big time, while it certainly produces enough taste to be enjoyed on its own.","GERMANY","aleigator"

344,"2013-12-07",2.4,"New review: 
Bottled 03NOV11:
Pours turbid golden with loose, soda like finger of white foam. Funky monkey here  soil, manure, lemon, baking soda, a hint of cucumber. Flavor is initially like soda water, then lemons come thru with a good amount of tartness, but softened and accented with a buttery tone. Thin body, dreadfully thin and empty with tight fleeting carb and a wet finish. This beer is not as disappointing as last time I had it, but nonetheless, I dont care for it one bit. 3.5/3/2/2/2.5

Original review from 04/2011
Bottled 03/2010
A: Golden, hazy beer (haze likely related to person pouring). Minimal head formation. Thin, broken sheet of some white foam. No lacing.
S: Horse manure. Very, very farmy. Reminds me of a hot day outside a relatively clean dairy farm. I love gueuze, and Im struggling to enjoy the smells of this one.
T: Sour, classic gueuze tartness. Unfortunately, still very super farmy, earthy, and fungal. 
M: Medium body with light to spritely carbonation.

Huge 3 finger head, orangey golden colour. 

The nose straightaway suggests a heavy sourness, with scents of tart, acidic, unripened fruits (grapes, orange & pineapple). 

Follows the nose in different steps. Highly sour upfront, giving way to funky fruits mid-palate and a sour champagne aftertaste. Lots of grassy, farmhouse sour lemon. One for those who really like to *taste* their beer and be challenged. 

Low carbonation and a dry crispness that carries the sour flavours beautifully. 

A fantastic beer - a summer sipper. Not for beginners!

Leathery, oaky flavours come in at the mid-palate, with a touch of raspberry freshness. More sourness at the finish brings in lime and tart apple. This is an excellent gueuze.

344,"2013-01-22",4.3,"Reviewed 12/31/2012. Thanks to Momar42 for all three gueuzes (and the kriek surprise afterwards!) This was part of the gueuze showdown, pitting Tilquins gueuze against the juggernaut duo known as Cantillon Gueuze and Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze. Part of a 750mL bottle poured into a Cantillon tulip. Notes from last nights Skins/Cowboys game.

A: Pours a hazy copper color, with a dinky half finger white head. Meh.

S: Now this is more like it. Id surmise this is the funkiest of the three, coming across almost like a moldy, stank-ass cheese (in a good way). Sourness is subdued compared to the others, but the grape presence comes across more brightly.

T: The opening flavor is a subtle, pleasant sourness. Afterwards comes lots of earthy, hay-like funk (and stank-ass cheese) to finish the flavor profile off. Theres a real complexity here thats hard to place, but still keeps the palate guessing brilliantly.

M: The delicacy and softness of the palate feel are simply to die for. Everything - from the dry finish to the carbonation - is perfectly measured. Super drinkable, period.

O: This was a narrow second place finisher - and a damn close finish at that - but at the same token, this is the only one where Id attempt to finish an entire large-format bottle solo. Refreshing, easy to drink, and challenging all at the same time.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

344,"2013-01-09",4.5,"375mL 2011 bottle. 
Aroma is everything I look for in a gueuze. A nice balanced acidity with some barnyard funk. A light phenolic note and some pineapple and tropical fruit esters. A light oak note helps bring the fruit and acidity together with the funkiness. A hint of a sweet malt character. No alcohol aroma. 
Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange with a big, pillowy white head that has very nice retention. Lacing is minimal as it slides back into the head. No legs. 
Flavor starts with a touch of sweet malt and some pineapple, tropical fruit and citrus esters. This recedes mid palate as the oak and barnyard phenolics take over. The oak is more prevalent than in the aroma and the phenolics have a hint of a smokey character to go along with the typical horse blanket. The finish brings more acidity as well as a bit more pineapple. A touch of astringency and no alcohol flavor. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium light bodied with high to effervescent carbonation. Low alcohol warmth. 
Overall this is a very enjoyable gueuze. Surprisingly easy to find; I hope people continue to pass this up as they hunt for Cantillon. I think the funkiness could use a bit more complexity but maybe that would come with age.

344,"2012-10-11",4.3,"2012 vintage picked up at West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago. I was surprised to see a few of these 750s sitting on the shelve. If nobody else wants them, I would be happy to dispose of them. Sampled in a Piraat tulip. The beer pours a light yellow-orange/peach in color with about a finger and a half worth of frothy white head. Nose is a beautiful melange of lemon, apricot, must, horse blanket, and some urine. Flavor is lemon rind, peach, must, oak, some faint bitterness, and is still moderately sweet. Once the funk takes over a bit more, the sweetness will disappear, but this blend is still a little young so it needs to sit awhile. Spritzy carbonation, almost overcarbonated honestly, gentle acidity, medium bodied, and a long finish. This has served as my favorite standard gueuze for awhile now.

Smelled of cider vinegar, oak, pale malt, and fruity Pez candy. There were also distinct notes of vinegary dill pickle, blue cheese and cow pasture. Light bodied and dry with moderate to high acidity. White wine, cider vinegar, unripe fruit, oak flavors with an almost red wine tannin-like note at the end.

Bottle (375 ml). Hazy golden/orange with a small long lasting white head and some lacing. Aroma is of 3F funk, barnyard, horse blanket, green apple, musty notes, tropical fruits and wood. Taste is slightly sweet with funky notes, barnyard, horse blanket, tropical fruits, earthy notes and wood. Light to medium body. Dry. Mouth puckering. This Oude Gueuze is a masterpiece! Great complexity, superb balance, extremely refreshing and drinkable, dry... a true world-class beer! 9-4-9-4-18 = 4.4

Bottle (750 ml) @ 3 Fonteinen Brewery (Beersel). Vintage 1987, shared by Armand Debelder himself, thanks! The cork wasnt in good shape and broke while Armand was opening the bottle. Hazy dark golden with a little quickly dissapating off-white head and no lacing. A nice amount of funk and barnyard is still there on nose, but theres also important oxydation notes as well as some cardboard. Theres also wood, hay and light lemony notes. Taste is also faily oxidized, but the barnyard and funk is still there and its quite complex. Moderately acidic. Medium body. Soft carbonation. Dry finish. This one isnt in perfect shape, but it really seems that the problem is the cork and not the lambic itself, the latter would have held up pretty well I think. Its still quite complex for an oxidized beer. And tasty. Less drinkable/refreshing than a fresher exemple though, 7-3-7-3-14 = 3.4

Bottle (750 ml) @ 3 Fonteinen Brewery (Beersel). Vintage 1997, shared by Armand Debelder himself, thanks! Hazy golden with a medium off-white head and little lacing. Aroma is of peppermint, nice funk, hay, lemon, dust, mold, wood and some fruitiness (mostly apples). Taste is also minty with light sweetness, moderate tartness, a good amount of barnyard and funk, hay, wood, apples and a nice minty finish. Medium body. Mouthfeel is hard to describe, but very similar to Millennium Geuze... velvery and woodsy. Dry finish. Exceptionnal Gueuze! Very similar to Drie Fonteinen Millennium Geuze except that we can feel the age a little on this one (less fresh). Great balance and excellent drinkability. And its still available at 3F Restaurant for 39 euros... dont miss it. 9-4-9-4-19 = 4.5  

Bottle (750 ml) @ In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst. Vintage 1999. Slightly hazy golden with a medium white head and little lacing. Aroma is of Drie Fonteinen funk with a nice minty touch, tons of barnyard, dust and hay. Taste is funky with nice barnyard, hay, mint, light green apples and oak. Medium body. Moderate/medium carbonation. Hard to describe mouthfeel... kind of velvety and oaky. Dry finish. Still super fresh. Crazily complex and awesome balance. Really drinkable and quenching. A perfect everyday gueuze (a guy can dream). Just a tiny step beind Millennium because the aroma of the latter is unreal. 9-4-9-5-19 = 4.6 / EDIT: Drank it again at Akkurat and it was even better. The taste was astonishing. Mouthfeel was so full. Super minty taste. A ton of layers of complexity. Wonderful. +1 for the appearance (5) and + 1 for the taste (10) = 4.8

Bottle (750 ml) @ 3 Fonteinen Restaurant (Beersel). Vintage 2001. Hazy golden/orange with a medium off-white/beige head and some lacing. Aroma is lemony with usual 3F funk, barnyard, medium acidity (more than in the usual 3FOG)  and woodsy notes. Taste is also lemony with a good amount of funk and barnyard, medium/heavy (not harsh though) acidity and a woodsy finish. Medium body. Medium/lively carbonation. Dry finish. Complex and tasty. Funkier than your usual 3FOG. Still quite drinkable. 9-4-9-4-18 = 4.4

Bottle (375 ml) @ Akkurat. Vintage 2002. Two bottles of the same vintage in 2 days. The first one was one of the best gueuze I have ever had. So fresh and minty with a nice depth, nice funk and just the right amount of sourness (not puckering at all). Very soft/smooth. 9-5-9-5-18 = 4.6 / The 2nd bottle I had was very good, but a bit heavier and less minty. A bit more acidic too. 9-4-8-4-17 = 4.2","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

On the palate its has a  fizzy, earthy start with notes of mossy mushroom moving quickly into a fruit driven berry cherry midpalate that gets soured down and puckered into a dusty dry finish.

344,"2012-08-22",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2015 This one is really my go to gueuze, it is a real treat! Smooth like no others there is only the tiny-est bit of sweetness to make it a sessionable gueuze.

It pours golden with haze. Huge nosiy head upon first pour. It dies down to an even covering of fine bubbles, more head retention that Ive seen from most geuzes. Tart nose, lemons, green apples, assorted funk. Big sourness in the mouth, notes of lemons, white grapes, grapefruits. Dry and quenching finish, oaky, touches of straw.

Taste: Crunchy hay drenched in lemon and white grapefruit juices for an acidic, tart, citrusy kick. Nibble of Granny Smith and white grape as the citrus settles down a bit.

This gueuze has a very hazy, yellow appearance. There is a small, white, fizzy head that gradually fades, leaving no lacing. Aromas consist of funky straw or hay, lemons (subtle), wild yeast. This smells like a traditional gueuze - heavenly. The flavor is wonderful. The beer has a healthy amount of tartness, with no astringency. The finish is acetic, but not so much so that I wouldnt consume a bottle of this nectar by myself. Its always a treat to drink this great beer.

Nose is pure bliss for any lambic lover: cheese, funk, dirty socks, citrus, hay, rotten crotch, sunshine warming up a damp meadow.  Fucking amazing.  An almost impossible act to follow, the taste delivers ever more.  It is delicate where it needs to be, but can also deliver the knock out blow when you arent paying attention.

344,"2012-05-08",4.3,"2010 vintage - poured from 12.7oz bottle to tulip glass:

Cork bursts from the bottle... Pours a bright honey/school bus gold - lively, noisy carbonation produces a full two fingers of fizzy, starch white head. Abundant needle point beading with muted lacing.

The nose is both soft and complex. Subtle white grapes, raspberry, spicy yeast, quite fruity, inviting sourness... a blanket of tart aggressiveness fills the nostrils.

The taste - beautifully dry, rhubarb, lemon, sour lime, grassy hops, such lively carbonation. Bits of white wine begin to surface as the beer warms. There is a world of complexity here that cant be understated. This is the type of beer that brings everything into perspective. Its the sort of beer that encourages the quest for better beer.

Its hard to explain in words how perfectly executed this is. A perfect balance of everything that I typically look for in a geuze. Im not sure what else to say... this beer is nearly perfect.","Orono, Minnesota, USA","FURLYSURIOUS"

344,"2012-03-12",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/16/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Drie Fonteinen Gueuze glass. Thanks to goodstrongbeer for bringing this over. 

Oude Geuze has a medium hazy golden color with a tint of tangerine. A small refined head fades to a collar, demonstrating proper carbonation for the style.

The aroma is fairly strong and complex. A lemon and citrus tartness wafts up my nose first, with a musty, grassy barnyard aroma containing mushrooms and hay toward the end.

The flavor starts with some light grains and a pungent, acidic sourness. Lemon zest and some grapefruit contribute to the illusion of fruit. Some minerals and oak begin to contribute toward a more champagne dry tartness toward the end. An undertone of grass and hay come in with a light stinky cheese and mushroom funk toward the end. 

This is definitely sour and puckering, with an acidity that is common in the style. The acidity up front creates some salivation, while it dries out a bit toward the end. The body is a little bit fuller than medium and properly carbonated.

This is just a splendid gueuze. With the flashes of flavor and elegant complexity, this is a beer I could enjoy over and over.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

I couldnt finish the bootle because of the violent acidity, but due to the lively carbonation it was still refreshing (in its fizzy champage w/lemon way) and drinkable the next day.

The sourness is pleasant, but theres a slight astringency in the finish and Im honestly not sure if its supposed to be there or not.  Its subtle enough that I feel like its part of the style, but I dont really care for it.  Im trying to judge the style and not let my personal preference interfere, but Id have to say this one is different than other lambics Ive had, so maybe its just that I havent tried enough lambics.

A - Pours murky straw yellow with a huge three finger tall fizzy white head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass. The bubbles are just racing up the glass.
S - This one is pretty pungent. The funk is pretty light initially but it gets stronger as it warms up. It has lots of fruit, mostly lemon and green apple, mixed with hints of fresh cut grass and damp earth.
T - The flavors are nearly identical to the nose. Lots of fruity sourness up front with the green apple sticking around until the end. Barn yard funk and some light dryness linger on the pallet after each sip. Not too bad but I would have preferred a bit more funk.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderately high carbonation. Once the initial fizzy feel dies down it leaves a crisp, funky, feel behind. Very nice.
O - I really like this one, I just think it was still a bit too young. I enjoyed how fruity it tasted but I prefer my gueuze to be a bit funkier. Still a great beer none the less.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Citrusy floral volatile aroma gives way to oak, dried apricot and damp linens (a refined barn yard, if you will). Theres quite good clarity here, and color is golden with a brassy orange hue topped with half-inch plush, persistent white head of tightly-packed tiny to medium bubbles with rising columns, leaving some lacing.
Medium body and perky effervescence support a flavor profile rich with some triple cream soft French cheese,  tropical fruit and fruit punch around a core of dried cantaloupe and honey that is then punctuated by quite tart lactic and red fruit sour, followed by a sweet lull then a blooming finish of fresh grapefruit that dries and sweetens.

344,"2011-10-28",4.0,"Ive had this beer so many times it almost feels improper to be giving it a review at all. I love this beer, one of my all time favorite go to beers. I could seriously live on this stuff. This review is specific to a less than a year old nov 2010 bottling. Young Geuze (haha, if theres such a thing). Look is a classic frosty lemon curd with some slight opacity. light nano-fiber foams cling to the glass like they arent sure if they can swim. Smell is a very forward lemony barnyard hay. This fresher bottle is alive with endless zest. Taste is a very balanced lemony horse blanket, really light on the funk right now, with a mild citric acid like bite. Mouth is almost still, but a latent soda-pop effervescence seems to come out of nowhere. This beer is truly a classic, but its a lot better to sit on for some years.

344,"2011-09-06",3.7,"I poured a 12.7oz caged and corked bottle into a champagne flute.

Appearance: Bright gold hue - almost glowing with brilliance. Extremely effervescent. Even a gentle pour produces  a massive, bright white, soapy head that retains and laces extremely well.

Smell: While not a very pungent nose there is ""farmhouse funk"" to indicate sourness. A light sour white grape or green apple scent make for a sweet, but light aroma. 

Taste: Very dry and light across the first half of the palate with a mild citrus pith taste that combines earthiness with citric tartness. The flavor  of Oude Geuze changes on a dime on the second half to something much more fruit - like soured white grapes and a Granny Smith apple at the peak of ripeness. It finishes with a grainy, almost corn-like flavor and leaves just a slightly dry aftertaste. Its a very interesting palate as some components are tasty and refreshing while other components are dry and tart and even burn the tongue a bit like a sour candy. But the palate overall isnt so much sour as it is tart and dry - in the vein of a saison, just without the overt dryness and zero peppery tastes or sensation. 

Mouthfeel: Thin, bubbly, a light stinging tart sensation and matching aftertaste.

Drinkability: A sour, tart, sharp palate to be sure, but nothing even the average beer drinker couldnt handle. Its a little difficult to drink more than a sip at a time mostly because the intensity builds the longer it lingers on the tongue. Plus the fact it is highly carbonated so the fizz gets stuck in the throat and causes belching after every other swig.

Overall, Oude Geuze is a tasty, interesting and fun beer to drink, but I dont think its anything approaching World Class territory.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

344,"2011-04-24",4.0,"750 ml from Binnys SL (Chicago, IL). 2010 Vintage, so a bit green. Havent had this in awhile and apparently have never rated it. Pours a nice hazy deeper golden orange hue, a good glow, well carbonated with decent layer of bright white bubbles, frothy, it dies to a good layer with some very nice lacing. Aromas are a lovely melange of fruit, lemons and pears, some peach, melon moving into dusty dry funk, hay, and horseblanket. Some yogurt, soft cheese, moderate funk. Wet oak, lactic acid. Very nice. Some pear, grapefruit. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, a firm unyielding brett beginning, dusty and barnyard take over, moving into some sufficient acidity, lemons, hay. More lemons grow, flaked wheat, yogurt, acidity and lactic acid start to build in a wave, a touch of a metallic twang into the middle. Finish leaves yogurt and lemons, bretty funk, dryness. Backend leaves a distinct wild yeast dryness and the lactic acid lingers on. Acidity and lactic acid grows as it warms, enveloping the palate, some wet oak, and the synergy from the dry and funky brett really works. A little intense for the uninitiated, but Im really diggin it. Some strength in spurts, goes down very easy in others. Good complexity, some sharp, dry lightly funky cheese. Very nice, fruity sourness sticks as it warms and really lingers on, making it a memorable treat. A classic.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Tastes are of course a bit on the sour side, slightly gastric acid, grapefruit and the bitter white zest-part of the lime. Must admit that Im glad I didnt buy the 0.75l bottle because I would have really struggled with that. Really dry. Aftertaste is cowberries and grapefruit.","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
344,"2011-04-04",4.0,"Quite the sour beer, 3 Fonteinen (Dutch for 3-Point Shot,) would probably rate higher with me if we didnt follow it immediately with Ithaca Brewerys Le Bleu.  Still, as a fruitless lambic, this beer tastes delicious, super tart with a mild bready middle and faint echoes of horse poop.  The oak provides a smooth, woodsy, vanilla-hinted finish, yet the sourness clings to the tongue for long seconds after the beer is gone.  Texturally, the beer feels divine, the oak aging tempering the usual overly boisterous character of a bottle-conditioned Belgian.  And, holy shit, cant believe I forgot this tidbit, this bottle of 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze is over 5 years old, being bottled in January 06.

As soon as I pop the cork, an unpleasant skunky odor wafts over to me...shit, another world-class brewer using green glass. How fucking annoying. Aside from the skunk, which dissipates after sitting for a bit, this beer is not as aromatic as the Cantillon Classic. The Brett is apparant, but not as pungent as the aforementioned beer. I want pungency, dammit! This beer also has some basement and wet river rock-type aromas, but not as strong; I also smell earth (aka dirt) and berries. Pours a hazy gold (though not as hazy as the Cantillon) with a medium white head that collapses in a couple of minutes. Taste is very sour, but not as much as the Cantillon. Its also kind of meaty; dry. Carbonation is medium-high, body is medium-full.

The taste is much stronger, tons of oak and must, the aroma on steroids but lacks depth. Its a touch to alcoholic and acidic... The feel is tart and dry, a little to wet on the finish though.

344,"2011-03-20",4.6,"Out of all the beer styles, lambics are one of my favorites and this one is an excellent representation of a this style. When pouring it into a goblet, the first thing that stands out is carbonation: this one is very active and fizzles like a glass of good champagne. Given the level of carbonation, its not surprising to find that the opaque golden body towers into an amazing head, although it dissipates quite quickly. Along with its tight lacing, the shear liveliness of this creature gives is it an outstanding appearance.  The aroma is funky  as it should be. The first impression drawn from the aroma is cider or vinegar perhaps and predicts a sour fruity taste. Indeed, the aroma is telling of the taste: a tart, granny smith apple-like flavor is followed by a very dry and salty finish. All-in-all, I still prefer the rougher feel of the Cantillon, but this geuze is still simply amazing.","Bergen, NORWAY, NORWAY","stunetii"

Pours a nice orange/old peach color that is murky and hazy. The head is small and white.

The smell is potent here. Tons of acidic sourness, lots of fruit peel, lemon, fruit, and some barnyard funk. The oak adds a nice wood tone that cloaks it all. It is very woody, not as much vanilla or tannin.

The taste is sour to the max almost. Biting lemon rind is the most prominent flavor. There is a bit more tannic flavor in the taste with the wood. There is a funky stickiness that coats your mouth with each sip. It is a true gueuze experience. There is a subtle spice in the background as well. This isnt quite the most complex gueuze Ive had but it is definitely smooth, and the quintessential sour flavor.

This is one of the better gueuzes out there it is a shock at first but mellows.

Appearance : Almost clear pale amber with a fairly big foamy head. Some lacing.

Aroma : Citrusy and woody. Some funk too. Light barnyard. Quite woody. Light oak sourness.

Taste : Woody and tart. Citrusy and a bit malty. Finish is woody and sharp tartness. Light oak sourness.

750ml bottle. 2000 Vintage. Shared by beerbuzzmontreal.

Aroma : Wood and light lactic with notes of cork. Nice apples with light dust. Quite a lot of dust actually.

Taste : Nice tartness but a bit mineral. Finish dry tart green apples. 

Overall : Im very happy I had the chance to try such an old bottle of this. I found the bottle to be slightly inferior to fresh bottles. It had less sourness but had lots of dust and light notes of cork. Im not sure if this comes from the aging or if this is how this vintage tasted like originally. Still a very nice drink.

A- Pours with a crazy, foamy, 3 finger+ white head which eventually settles to 1 finger and some lacing left behind. Body is a nearly transparent golden yellow hue.

S- Vinegar, lemon, acidic tartness, vanilla, and oak. Nose overall is very balanced between these characters and very good.

T- Taste is the epitome of a gueze. Hints of sour lemon, acidic tartness and nice backbone of oak and vanilla. Finish is conistent with initial flavor but slightly more tart and slightly dry. 

M- Very good. Smooth with soft carbonation. Body is lightweight and slightly yeasty.

D- This is an awsesome beer overall and pretty much what I think of when I think of a great classic gueze. I see why this is the example to compare the rest of the style too. I am looking forward to having this again!

A: Light golden-wheat colored body. Two fingered fluffy white head. Good retention and nice sheet-like lacing.
S: Fairly straight forward, classic gueuze aromas. Sour lemons, a bit of wheat, and musty lactic acid.
T: An improvement on the nose is evident with a nice sour lemon blast, a nice general lactic tartness, wheat, funky yeast, some oak and other citric notes. In the end I think the lactic tartness starts to separate itself from the other flavor notes.
M: Smooth, medium bodied brew. Lingering tartness. Really dry, but damn refreshing.
O: A special beer for sure. Its a toss up with the Girardin Gueuze and Cantillon Classic. If you havent had this yet do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle.

A-pours a hazy golden orange color with lighter edges and a tight slightly off white bubbly head.

T-lemon up front, lots of acidity, barnyarnd and musk, nice note of vinegar, a storng sour tartness, apple and pear in the back with a bit more of acidity.

M-smooth feel, lighter medium body, lots of carbonation giving a good crisp dry feel in the back.

D-this has some nice things going on and goes down very easily.  the funkiness is nice and this has a ton of acidity to it but enough sweetness to balance and the complexity you want to see in a gueuze (and expect to see from 3F).
**********
Had the 99 Vintage to compare with the 50th Anniversary and the blauw.  Flavors were slightly muted, especially compared to the two others mentioned.  Much less funky than a typically Oude geuze, minerally and earthy with lighter fruit aspects of pear, peach, and citrus and notes of dry barrel.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

The pour is clear pale yellow with an impressive potent white frothy head. The nose is classic and so much more balanced than many other gueuzes around. Citric sour  and lemon.

A - Hazy golden-orange honey color with a large, foamy, rocky white head with pretty good retention leaving a thin, patchy layer of lacing and some sticking to the glass.

S - Tart and sour lemon, apple and grape along with a touch of acidic vinegar aroma. No too heavy on the vinegar aroma for the style though. Also a strong yeast and barnyard funk present. A touch of grassy and mineral aroma in the background.

T - Starts with a tart and sour lemon and apple flavor. Just the slightest acidic taste comes out. Mid sip has a strong sour lemon come out with hints of yeast and a little funk. This then gives way to a more sweet and sour fruit taste. Strong grapefruit along with some apple and pear and hints of apricot and peach. Obviously lemon and some lime are still quite strong. The are sour and mouthwatering and a little puckering, but the also have a fairly strong sweet kick. The sweet sour mix is somewhat like a very sour candy as the sweetness isnt dominant, more of a background taste.

M - Medium to full body with moderate carbonation. Very juicy and mouthwatering feel. A little puckering as well and a touch creamy.

D - Pretty drinkable beer. With the almost absent acidic flavor and the slight sweetness, the drinkability is pretty good. The juicy, sour, mouthwatering taste keeps me reaching for some more to drink.

Notes: Best before 03/03/18. Nice fruity and lightly sweet Gueuze. Mix of sour and sweet, but the sweet is subdued. A lot of lemon, apple, grapefruit, and other fruit. Well balanced, and complex. Really enjoyable sour that is worth trying. Right on the border of world class.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Pours explosively, had to slow down and be cautious. Really exceptional aromas bursting - wet hay with a twinge of bubblegum esters, gruyere cheese, peach pit. Very heady smell- love it.  Proteiny lacing clings to the glass tenaciously. A nice acidic presence that doesnt quite punch you in the face like Cantillon, yet provides a satisfying pucker.  Suave in the mouth, followed by a nice slowly drying finish.  Has a very old-world quality, makes me think of reading leather bound books by the fireside in comfortable nightclothes with my favorite hound by my side. Absolutely top grade craftsmanship here.  Hard to imagine it being any better, the ten dollar Federal Reserve Note that I gave for this seems worthless in comparison.","Graham, North Carolina, USA","gueuzeisgod"

This is very sour, almost vinegary, with a lot of pleasant fruity notes to it, with lemon and apple being noticable.  Very awesome.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"

I traded for this maybe 6 years ago, and it has been hiding in the back of the fridge since then.  It opened with a strong ""pop"".  It pours an orangish-amber color.  There was a small head on it, but it dropped away rather quickly.  What an aroma.  I really dont know where to start on this one.  Bunches of sour fruits, and definitely a bit funky.  There is some sourness in the aroma.  The taste is superb.  All kinds of sour fruits in here, that have blended together over the years.  A bit of spiciness also, with some earthiness in the background.  Kind of hard to explain, but there is a fullness as well as a lightness to the body at the same time.

344,"2009-12-08",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2010 750mL 1999 ed courtesy of Travlr and again courtesy of Armand. This is so insanely good. Note that this is the 1999- which many consider the best geuze ever made. Armand I think would agree. From talking to him directly, this one is made with Boon, Girardin, and Lindemanns lambik. This, as Armand said, can never be replicated and is really just a product of pure luck and circumstance. The 1999 geuze I have had twice and love it to death. First, it pours like an unblended. It is super deep, cloudy orange with no head. Aroma is incredible. You can smell it from 20 feet away: huge leather, tannins, citrus, blood orange, mango yogurt, feet, sweat. Taste is beautiful soft yogurt/lactic, bright citrus, curacao, grapefruit, just mouth-watering all the way around without being too sour or acetic. The Girardin being blended in here is just so awesome as a base lambic. Very quick, zippy palate. I cant find anything wrong this this geuze and see no reason to put it up with J&J Blauw. 
375mL 2007 ed courtesy of Shyam. Pours a super deep super hazy orange with a one-finger, very rocky, off-white head. Beautiful. Aroma is chardonnay, curacao, lime juice, grapefruit juice, some spice, lemon tart, key lime pie. There is some sweat, leather, barnyard in there. Taste is sour, tart, acidic, white wine. Huge sour warheads. Dry aftertaste with some sort of semi-quenching character that insists upon you to try more. Bubbly, spritzy on the palate. The thing I hate about gueuze is that it takes so much time, effort, and precision to create them but about three seconds to drink them. This is excellent. Not as intense as Girardin Black Label, but still awesome. 8/4/8/5/14 = 3.9 I am rating the 1999 ed mainly because I like to score a beer the highest mark that I have ever given it, even if I have had multiple samples that are inferior. I feel it is unfair to average out all of my scores for special lambics like this.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Nose is typical oude with a lot of earthy, tart, funkiness going on; tartness is lemons and lime peel, tannic and wet oak notes, horse blanket, wet earth, mushrooms, even some sharp cheese notes.  Flavor is still young with more tartness and sour notes than expected; puckering sour lemon notes dominating with also wet oak (almost cork-like), faint horse blanket, light sour apple, very tannic, bread yeast, and some drying bitterness into the finish.  Palate is puckering, fizzy, light to medium, dry finishing, and refreshing.  Finishes very dry, still sour with lemons, wet wood, and some earth and faint sharp cheese on the tongue.  Still somewhat of a hard style for me to rate with so many differences from most beers I am used to drinking.  However, it is a dying style that is refreshing change from the norm.

Smells of funky lemons, cherries, maybe a hint of apples. No booze or hops present. Fairly good and funktastic.

344,"2009-07-31",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2015 So I rated this 6 years ago, from a 2004 bottle.... 
Drinking a bottle now and reading over the rating there are some things I disagree with, but the primary sentiment is intact to this day. 
This might be my favorite beer, maybe.... I mean there are beers I rate higher & there are beers I drink more of, but  at the end of the day... I  might prefer drinking a bottle of this beer to almost any other one in existence. 
This is a beer that holds a deep personal attachment for me, I can honestly say that I have drank it in some of the happiest, and some of the most challenging moments in my life, and many times I have drank it to mark those moments. 
This is a beer that, for me... is above all else made to the highest standard with the spirit and the heart of the producer very much alive in the finished product. 
I say this, because six years ago when I first tried this beer, and rated it.... it was simply a ""good gueuze"" in the end thats all that it is, but it is a beer that I have come to love dearly in the last half of a decade, and so maybe a rerate is in order.
Ironically enough this is a 2014 bottle, so ten years removed from the production of the beer in my initial rating. 

Pours a beautiful golden with a medium sized head and decent lacing on the glass.

The aroma is wonderfully inviting, fruity and somewhat floral at the start with some barnyard funkiness and some white oak. It has a bit of white grape & lemon zest with a touch of brine. 

The flavor is bright, sour, balanced, and well nuanced with flavors of white grape, pear, mild oak, citrus rind & mild brine. The bitterness is subdued but well employed & the beer is absolutely dry as a brut champagne. 

The palate is lively as champagne with a beautiful sharpness and a long lingering finish. 

absolutely beautiful

344,"2009-07-04",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2013 april 27, 2010 bottle consumed january 21, 2012.  pours a clear golden orange with a quickly disappating foamy white head.  aroma of dusty,   fresh soft leather, rustic wet grass, pear skin, and a light doughy herbal note.   taste is bright tangy red grapefruit and tangerine lemonzest.    creamy sour yogurt with a touch of lemon zest.     sourness.    7 out of 10 on the old dry scale.      that classic drie fonteinen character that pops in some of the classic dre fonteinen beers is relatively subtle and young.  6-7 year old bottles of this seem to be the sweet spot.    like quite a bit always, but if you catch a good batch at a good point in time, look the fuck out.

The nose is extremely citric, with some suggestions of peach, and of course, that deliciously filthy barnyard funk, in all its tart, acetic, bretty glory. The flavour starts off with lemon rind, funky brett yeast and some super-sour and tart green apple. The finish is very salty with a lingering of barnyard/horse blanket dankness. White pepper and plenty of wood is present toward the finish. The mouthfeel is thin, crisp, and drying. The carbonation is appropriately prickly. The brightness from the one-year-old and the earthiness from the 3-year-old. Really intense, even for a gueuze!","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

The aroma is seriously funky in addition to the tart vinegar aroma with some definite lemony tartness as well.  There are hints of light fruit sweetness, especially peaches and apples, in the nose, but its definitely second fiddle behind the sourness and funk.

The taste is extremely acidic up front which really puckers the lips. After a couple of sips and as it warms, there is more complexity that comes out with the sweetness of the peaches and apples.  The finish is a combination of lemony tartness, vinegar burn and straight-up barnyard funk.

The mouthfeel is light to medium and highly carbonated.  Its extremely and dry and very wine-like in the finish.

As with most of the Belgian sours Ive had, Im still working to get my taste buds prepped for the acidic onslaught that inevitably ensues when I try them.  That said, I enjoyed this beer and it is very good for the style.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

First time I tasted this favourite and then I lost the rating. The times I’ve had it since I’ve always thought I had rated it  well, I had  so didn’t make a new rating. Doubtful it would make a 4.5 the second time around but definitely closer to 4.5 than 4.0.

Even the aroma is dry! Tarty outhouse and wild yeast. Flavourful, loads of acidity but I’d still have it as a session beer. My stomach would probably spring a leak, however. Some metallic tones (copper, iron?) in the dryness.

344,"2008-07-22",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2009 A live experience: Im setting here at my desk with a cooled down edition of  3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze. Slowly I pour the geuze into my glass... There is aboslutely no head and the colour is hazy orange. My first impression of the aroma is a bit of surprise. I expected sourness in the style of Cantillon, but it is actually quite balanced with notes of apple, melon, pear and metal - very nice. I take my first sip... Immediately Im hit by an aggressive acidness as if biting into a unripe apple. The sensation is that of very dry champagne or grape fruit. Perhaps the flavours die away a bit too quick in the ending, but the initial feeling is really great and not too extreme. A further plus is the lack of sour eruptions one can sometimes experience drinking geuze. I am actually blown away by this one - its so perfectly balanced, dry and fruity that I am in beer heaven. For the first time I truly understand the bliss of a lambic - geuze.","Odense, DENMARK","Blom"

344,"2008-06-28",3.7,"The next Drie Fonteinen to grace my refrigerator was the Oude Geuze, resplendent in the imperial majesty this beers reputation commands.  The smooth, satin soft head is the off-white color of a pumpkin seed with an aged looking tan circumfrence.  The body matches nicely with a foggy pumpkin rind orange hue.  The aroma is predictably sour and sweet, so I don my galoshes and rain coat on for protection as I try to pick out flavors in the intense Oude Geuze storm.  Lactose, cinnamon, espresso, whipped cream topping and nutmeg try to tame a sweeter-than-sour ligneous vinegar aroma, but mostly fail.  Its a powerful smell.  But puny compared to the flavor, which starts as a sucker punch ""Kapow!"" straight to the palate.  To quote the Orcs from Warhammer, ""WAAAUGH!""  After the initial sour drawing and quartering of my tongue, the Oude Geuze settles into a gentle, slightly toasty flavor that begins in the mid-sip and endures to the after taste.  I also find this second stage taste to be somewhat dry and a bit on the wood varnish side, but appropriate considering the Oude Geuze milieu.  A bit sour for me, thanks, but those with fewer taste buds are likely to really enjoy this.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

344,"2008-05-20",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a translucent olive-orange with absolutely no head. The aroma is very tart yet wheaty. As it hits the tongue, an interesting funk grabs the taste buds as the extremely light carbonation causes a subtle tingle. The funk would be attributed to aged milk and socks. As weird and possibly grotesque as it sounds, its actually an interesting flavour. Subtle attributes of a mild cheese lingers in the background. As the brew sits on the tongue, a burning tartness begins to escalate. (I havent found anything that I can attribute to the sourness, other than what a spoiled, fermented beverage may taste like; but I am not willing to get a stomach pump, ever.) Wheat explodes as the brew passes the tongue. The finish is a nice mix of wheat, subtle mild cheese, and a good amount of tartness. Its dry. I find myself gritting my teeth a few times while drinking this.
Geuze seems to be a hard style for me to rate without using what seems like disgusting descriptions. But this is seriously really good.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"
344,"2008-05-19",4.4,"Poured from a 12.7oz caged and corked bottle (dated Nov. 30, 2005) and served in a tumbler.  This beer poured a hazy, glowing orange with a two-finger thick head of tight, beige fizz that slowly faded away into a thin, lasting cap.  Not much lace to speak of.  The aroma of the beer was made up of oak, grass, oranges, along with loads of funk.  The flavor was very woody and earthy.  Lots of wet wood, mildly tart acidity, sourdough, and a light citrus sweetness.  Extremely funky, but not overly sour.  The mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied and a bit crisp with modest carbonation.  Insanely drinkable and thirst-quenching.  Lovely stuff!","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Aroma is seriously intense...fills the room quickly upon cracking the bottle open.  Nice funk to the aroma, lots of wet leather and some apple-like fruit accents...pretty darn nice overall.  Flavor is pretty intense as well.  Quick burst of sweet fruit up front quickly subsides into a very dry, leathery, sour middle and finish.  Highly acidic throughout, and the carbonation was high.

344,"2007-12-12",3.7,"This beer was a pretty good gueuze, although I found it very acetic, and although the sourness was nice I wouldve enjoyed a bit more sourness and champagne character.  Nonetheless, still pretty good.  Thanks to SurlySober for sharing this bottle with me.

Appearance was an attractive hazy straw color with two fingers of fluffy white head.  Aroma was a mix of light champagne character, acetic vinegar-ness, and a bit of fresh-cut apple fruitiness.  This beer also seemed a bit light-struck.  Flavor was rather sour, but didnt totally make me pucker.  There was also some light apple and champagne notes.  Mouthfeel was fairly light and bubble-y and appropriate.  I did enjoy this beer and would recommend it.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

344,"2007-11-30",3.7,"Bottle.

Pours a dark orange body with a large foamy white head - receding to a small white creamy covering. Very dry aroma has some nice properties but remains mostly woody oak and earthy in most aspects. Flavour is quite smooth and not completely funky. Predominantly dry and woody flavour. Finishes with a slight grapefruit twang but it’s not overly complex.  Pleasant and refreshing level of carbonation.

I’ve had vintages that I’ve enjoyed more so perhaps I need to be a more diligent with my samplings.

Aroma of hay, dandelion flowers, metal playground equipment in the sun. A touch of brine. Very bright and summery. The first sip is almost disappointingly soft. The bracing slap of sourness actually turns out to be quite gentle. But after the surprise...the softness is very welcome. There is a pleasant quinine and chalk component to the sourness that adds to its refreshing quality. Green chewy leaves, pepper, a bit of lime. I suspect my bottle is a bit on the young side--carbonation level is moderate, and while dry compared to any other sort of beer, there is a touch more sweetness than sometimes offered in an aged gueuze. Subtle, balanced, profoundly refreshing.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"
344,"2007-11-04",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2010 Well, I found myself at Akkurat in Stockholm and figured that this was the place to have my first lambic, and drie fonteinen oude geuze looked like it was the best call.   375ml bottle.   Solid gold to orange with a small head.   Very acidic sour aroma, like acetic acid and alcohol, and some wierdness that I cant describe.  Flavor is a harsh sour, extremely dry and crisp.   Highly carbonated and quenching mouthfeel.   I think its funny that my notes are pretty much the same as people who give this a 4.5.   I guess I was just shocked at what a geuze tastes like.   maybe i should have started with a kriek?    A good experience, even if the flavors and aromas were a bit extreme to my unaccustomed palate.   Ill have to come back to this later and see if it grows on me. (4,4,6,4,12) Rerate: 375cl bottle, bottled March 2008.   Super pop upon opening, though no gushing.   Big frothy white head atop a gold body.   The aroma has some more solventy harsh notes at first, but they mostly fade as the beer warms and opens up.   Just crazy, funky stuff.   Weird vegetal and acidic notes with some mop bucket.   Super dry and sour with tons of dirty funk and lots of prickly champaign-like bubbles.   Very light bodied.   Acidic all the way through the finish.   Still a crazy gueuze, and seems more out there than some of the others that I have had since this was my first gueuze over two years ago.   Even though my palate has change considerably since then, I still remember many of the same qualities, though I appreciate them much more.   Ah, that finish is to die for.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
344,"2007-11-04",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2009 12.7 oz. bottle.  Pours a dark, hazy orange.  Swamp-foam head, nice lacing down the side.  Aroma is sour orange, lemon, grass, must, white grapes.

I dont think its exceptional, but its certainly enjoyable.

UPDATE: From a 10-year old 75cl bottle, big thanks to Ryan.  Pours darker than the younger blend with a thin head.  Musty, dank aroma with a twinge of metal.

Opaque and peachy tangerine colored, and sported a lively but fleeting head.

An old leather tobacco pouch, for a Beer that old it had a striking freshness to it that tickled your nose, almost like freshly cut lemons, it wasnt as dusty or musty as I expected.

Still very much alive after a decade corked and caged, it had a very mineral flavor that reminded me of some of Fantômes offerings. Acidity in the mid range (for a gueuze), and the aftertaste left a certain oxidized feeling in my mouth that might betray its age, but was still quite enjoyable, especially with my mussels.

2004 bottling, lot 22. First example of the style, Im excited. Pours a gorgeous combo of plum and orange, with a small white head that fades to a sudsy white ring on top of the beer. The aroma is alive - yeast, funk, spice, honey, lemon, oranges and barnyard notes. Smells divine. Wow, this is amazing. Lemon, hay, orange, honey, clove, yeast and a wonderful flavor from the oak aging. Finish is lemony tart, not mouth puckering, supremely long in length and fades to a nice honey sweetness.

344,"2007-07-25",4.7,"What can I say? I guess that beers like this are a reminder of just how fantastic the world of beer can be. It looks absolutely fantastic, with a steady stream of bubbles holding up a thick, foamy head. Aroma is heavy on the citrus (lemon particularly) and oak (in the best possible way) and light on the more wild elements that enhance something like Girardin and detracts from something like Cantillon. As a result Id say its not the most complex aroma in the world of gueuze but its incredibly focussed, and its focussed on deliciousness. It tastes so soft, fresh and juicy after more than two years in the bottle, with an incredibly clean acidity. So incredibly drinkable... and these days I think thats the point with gueuze. Its the kind of thing that makes you stop getting all geeky and just sit there and drink. Fantastic.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

344,"2007-07-09",4.1,"Poured with aplomb from a wicker basket (and a great height) at Pocchenellekelder, Brussels. Where do you begin? Hazy orange with an initially creamy head of suds. All the saliva-tickling lemon juice sharpness youd expect, but combined with a depth of sodden, peaty malt whiskey woodiness and blue cheese dankness Ive never encountered before. Lemony, meaty, tingly and slightly smoke-tinged. Mould and sherbet. Lingers with a distinctly creamy, blue-veined mouldiness. Brie-smeared cellar walls, sherbet lemons and whiskey.

I think Im starting to understand why Im digging the lambics so much - there arent crap breweries trying the style that taint the reputation of the style.

The aroma is very clean with wild yeast, pepper, tart lemon zest, lots of earthiness and grapefruit - very crisp and grainy.  Medium / light body that is grainy and effervescent - very refreshing super-crisp.  The taste starts with clear tart citrus, wild crisp yeast, some barnyard, but fresher than normal and light spice.  The finish brings out grainy peppery spice and almost a creamy finish.... well, at last for a lambic.  Excellent.  Further down the bottle there is more barnyard and oak starts becoming apparent, however even with these traits becoming prevalent it still remains crisp and refreshing.

344,"2007-03-31",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2008 March 2007.  Vintage 1999.  The pour is a cloudy, thick haze.  Light orange, dusty color.  Lemon aroma comes first.  Blue cheese, sawdust, pepper.  Finally its like stepping into a misty nighttime fog, the wet air heavy with the smell of new flowers.  Damp as the walls of the cave.  Spicy wheat flavor unravels into wild but sophisticated strangeness; orangey citric acid, wet moss, infection, white pepper.  Brisk, clean, wild.

July 2008.  Vintage 1999.  Clean apricot orange pour, with a touch of mist.  Caramelized skins of citrus aroma, lemon and lime juices, vanilla, and a soft champagne vinegar.  Seems to have sweetened  a bit.  A film of attic must envelopes the middle in dusty haze, even if there isnt much horseblanket stink to make it really funky.  A blanketing, if distant, salty, cheese and cured meat antipasto quality is really appetizing.  Fruit characters are firm and soft, in watermelon, cantaloupe, and nectarine.  Fleshy and chewy, and still seeming somewhat caramelized.  The moist, evocative late summer sweetness of those fragrances seems crisply reminiscent of the glory of the Blauw gueuze. Flavor is a burst of cheesy funk settling in the mold of citrus yogurts and stony fruits.  Apricots and blood oranges swimming the tang of goat cheese cream.  Mineral heavy, and coldly bitter at times, but ridden with a wild and fresh cleansing herbal character.  A tang of a heavier balsamic type of vinegar lends a certain syrupy quality, sweet and musty.  Wooden.  I love the resilience of the bright and soft fruit sweetness; its like a stagnant humid sunrise of fresh summer stone fruits.   Medium bodied, cotton soft palate is bright and reasonably acidic.  Middle brings a bit of mint, and the finish just lacquers the back of the throat in dried out, herbal goat cheese, smacking more intensely on the rind of the cheese and dirty minerals than almost every other confident gueuze I can think of, almost belligerent in confidence and force.  Its a textbook rewriting finish.  All around awesome; gentle, but unbridled.  A classic. 8/4/9/5/19 4.5","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Surprisingly Im giving it the same rating as the first time I had this. Expensive (especially for this half bottle), but very very good.

11-18-06: 750ml, My first gueuze/lambic and going with the Ohio State - Michigan game(we won). First, I love the bottle and label, very appropriate. Sour green apples and lemon juice. Very juicy, bubbly, and fun.

Softer palate structure than I expected but still very good. Good sour fruits right through the palate but doesnt really stray into the intense territory. Good grapey notes as well and finishes with some minerals and pepper. Stil some years to go yet.

Dark in colour for the style; kinda dirty orange. Thin head with decent density. Shows a lot of power with classic sour fruits and bitting acidity but well balanced and very drinkable at the same time. Persistent citrus drive on the finish. (e.5.0 @ t Brugs Beertje).

Thin head, well built, cloudy orange body. 9 years of bottle age becomes very evident on the nose with old, grapey, wine-like notes and a hint of sour fruit. Palalate is something special as the bracing acidity and sourness evident in so many young gueze has all but disappeared. More vinous and mild sour notes drive the palate and plenty of fizz keeps the beer dancing across the mouth. Just a hint of volatile acidity.

Very hazy golden orange with little fizz and no head.  Intense, inviting aroma: bright sourness compliments a saison-y mustiness with spicy orange, sweet gingerale, corriander, celery, and white grape notes.  The flavour begins with a pungent dryness offset by a musty bitterness that doesnt seem to be from hops.  The transcendent souness carries the flavour experience through faint banana and a bouqet of spices and fruits that includes red cherries, corriander, ginger, and celery.  The sourness and drynes are a bit pervading.  Mildly acrid feel up front fades to a sharp bitter and then a clean banana.  High carbonation.  Soft and powdery.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

Sour, tart and tight in flavour. Light citric lemon peel sides, good hairy goat presence on the palate making it rough and rugged, short dressed showing of rose petals, raspy weeds, damp cellar and fresh pine-wood.

rerate of 99 vintage in May 2010. Pithy citrus nose, lovely lactic acids, lots of horseblanket and cheese, light lemon. The taste is just perfection. Moderate acidity, all of it lactic acid, tons of citrus peal, light cotton candy, lots of hay. Just an amazing, amazing vintage and its a total shame that this doesnt have its own listing.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"

To me the aroma is the most evocative feature of this celebrated beer, its musty, dusty, yeasty, cobwebby scent redolent of brasseries artisanales hidden in grimy backwaters of la Belge profonde where the uneven brick floors have soaked up decades of spilt fruits and lambics. Taste combines tartness with grapefruit bitterness to make a memorable drinking experience.","Bedford, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","hughie"

Sweet citrus in the nose, and a nice upfront sourness on the first taste.  As that fades it leaves way to oakey flavors, wood, and the ever present sourness.  Awesome.

344,"2006-06-30",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2008 Re-Rate. Bottle dated Apr. 2, 2001.  Different label than the picture; it seems like a vintage, but the vintage rating is only for 2002 and after.  Hazy grapefruit color in the glass, large fizzy head dissipates quickly.  Lemony and skunky smell, yeasty things going on.  Strong carbonation on a light body; acidity is stiff but slow burning, takes two seconds to emerge in lemony goodness.  This is awesome, but the palate seems a bit weak; I dropped it one point, but I also raised the smell one point from the original rating.

Original Rating. 37.5 cl bottle into tumbler, Bier Circus.  After having my Drie Fonteinen Framboos order ripped away from me (the lady said they didnt have any more, but I have my doubts), this was the fall back, and it was a good choice.  Hazy brown gold in the glass with a peach frothy head.  The smell doesnt give much, pretty much just some bitter brett and not much fruit character at all.  The taste is a sour bomb at first, it takes over the whole mouth in a rush; however strong the sourness is, it cant keep back an insistent brett, which forces its dry way up through the middle; only to be replaced by a resurgent sourness right before the swallow.  The finish blends the two nicely, tasting of a very dry blending of muscat and proseco (it retains a tiny bit of the sweetness of the former); in the middle of the finish, some hops push through with a very un-citrus bitter and become the dominant feature, although theres still sourness lingering strongly on top of it (its an amazing flavor, each layer well-defined and coexisting while being almost exactly complimentary); after a long ass time (30 seconds or so), the finish mellows and tastes distinctly of apples.  Decidedly dope.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

This is my first, and possibly my only ever 5. I drank this on the eve of my college graduation, with my closest friends and girlfriend. Having saved the (rather expensive) bottle for many months specifically for this occasion, this beer not only represented the culmination of my 20 years of education, but after slighty over a year what will probably be the climax of my beer drinking life; thus, I felt it would be sacrilage to honor this beer, or more importantly this occasion, with anything but a 5. After all, I use this site primarily for my own records, and this will surely be a memory Ill be happy to see at the top. 

Granted, this beer was also quite awesome. 

450 beers later and a year of drinking, sniffing, analyzing and rating, I am quite proud of the knowledge, palate development, and respect from others I have gained in the beer world. I am able to sit down with one of the worlds great drinks and see deeply into it; to notice complexities not readily evident, and, for a beer of this intensity, be able to bear and tame the visciousness in my mouth. 

Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze, 2000 vintage, pours a brilliant yellow orange with hazy highlights and a pillowy, wispy cloud white head. The head fades fast but leaves subtle, soft lacing along the slender edges of my glass. A powerful, pungent aroma leaps forth from the brew, consisting strongly of tart lemons, funky barns, and a stroll along the countryside. Once in the mouth, it is even more intense, striking at you with a brutal sourness that begs to be adored, overlaying a perfect horsiness and a touch of sweet lemon. Zesty orange and kumquats show up for the show as well. It is fizzy and biting, and leaves a warm feeling in the mouth, though different than that of strong alcohol. This is far and away the best gueuze I have had, featuring perfectly balanced and drinkable flavors, right on target, though not being the least bit tame or for the weak of heart. It was the perfect beer to celebrate the beginning of the rest of my life.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

344,"2006-02-10",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2006 Rating #950.  From Boutip (Secret Santa).  01/28/2003 bottle.  The beer pours to a glowing, lightly hazy 22k golden body with a huge foamy white head.  Tons of visible carbonation in the body.  The aroma is very strong but is also very balanced and delicate.  Acidic apples and balsamic vinegar.  Also, complex leathers.  The last gueuze I had that I remember was much stronger in flavor.  It had that face cringing/melting sourness (gueuzyness).  This beer, however, is much more subtle.  Delicate and not pungent.  Still, a nice light tartness, sweet balsamic vinegar, cherries, and leather.  Very easy drinking since the palate isnt ""obscenely"" overcarbonated/acidic/sour.  Girardin kicked my ass, and I liked that.  Lou Pepe Gueuze was also ""strong"".  The palate on this is too smooth.  Its great, but light and not in my face like I feel the style.  Doesnt dry out my mouth as much as I think it should.  Thanks VERY much for this brew Mr. B.

Rerate: 1/22/2004 vintage at Falling Rock.  Pours to an orange hazy body with a thin sheen white head.  The aroma is leather, lightly tart, some light funkiness.  Mellow and well blended.

The nose is at its best when you let the enormous head fall, to about 2 inches (and what a falling, I might add.)  Its very expressive at that point, compared to a full huge froth, which doesnt reveal much, or a small, filmy head, which is still pretty vibrant, but not quite as expressive.  It releases a very fruit filled aroma with hints of apples, orange and grapefruit along with an unbelievably woody scent which hints of freshly cut, burnt and white wine stained wood and a touch of leather.  The flavor is so fruit filled, almost like a platter of full, gummy fruits or a packet of fruit snacks, with easily detectable notes of peach, nectarine, and grapefruit and perhaps a light hint of apple.  All supported by a very firm maltiness, a clean, yet approachable tartness and an extraordinary wood barrel character.  Wow, what artful balance.  Armand is the man.  Its amazing he can choose a blend between Girardin, Oud Beersel, Hanssens...etc...and come up with a blend like this.  While I find some gueuze unexciting (Frank Boons Oud Beersel and Franks Boons lambics in general), some a bit harsh (A few of Cantillons offerings; Fou Foune, Gueuze, although I do love some) and some a bit plain (Hanssens), I find Drie Fonteinen unbelievable almost each time.

Taste is so well balance between sourness, tart, little bit of acidity, green apple with some nice funky yeast also thrown in. Probably one of the finest Lambic that I had the chance to try and the fact that the acidity is lower then Cantillon makes it easier to drink larger quantity.
Re-rate 2006 (bottle date 1999): Complexity in this beer is just incredible (farmhouse, horseblanket, oak, tart) and appearance is just perfect (huge foamy head with perfect retention) Can really ask more from a gueuze.

Also have had a number of bottles ranging from 2-8 years in age.
Overall I can say that its simply an amazingly rich and delicious lambic.  Every time I drink it, I find its exactly what I want in lambic.  Funky, stinky cheese and sweaty nose, but its also subtle when it needs to be, with subdued flavors and aromas of pear, white grape and wheat.  Has a lucious estery farmhouse scent that tells of spring, and I dig my nose into each glass like I never want to smell anything ever again.  The sourness is so phenomenally balanced between sour sugary fruit and acidic biting punchiness.  Every time I drink it Im reminded that its simply one of the best beers in the world.

Nov/2006 bottle consumed early 2009.

Honey colored and still.  Coarse burnt honey and butter nose and flavor.  Touch of crabapple and toast.  Good but not the best vintage or age.

Naturally, I compared this to Lindemans Gueuze Cuvee Rene and there were of course striking similarities, but also many distinct difference.  This gueuze seemed a good amount sweeter and while Cuvee Rene tends to be more peppery and yeasty throughout, this one saved its immense tartness for the finish.  Body on the Drie Font tended to be a bit more loose and oxidized, but this is from age for sure, the Lindemans I have tried being 2-4 years younger.  The Drie Font also had much more citrus presence, with hints of honey wheat dough. I really found the Cuvee Rene to be a bit more funky and unpredictable, but this one was no disappointment.  Truly a pleasure to try this, and Im happy to have a bottle in my cellar (that will certainly get tons of cellar time before I try again).2001 bottle sampled November 2004 (Belgian Beer Fest).  Pours a deep orange, very similar to the 1999 if somewhat less sweet, perhaps.  Still, the citrus is very noticeable in this one and it is quite creamy and full-bodied.  Surprising residual sugar flavor near the finish, much like honey.Another sample of a 2001 bottle, side by side with 2003 Cantillon.  This one has so much less funk, horsecrap, wet hay and what not, much more clean, straightforward tart brett, dry and zesty, sour green apples and a really nice mouthfeel, but its no Cantillon in my book.Feb 2004 bottle.  Drunk in Aug 2006.  More acidic, along the lines of the 2002 vintage release, though probably not as sour/lactic as that one.  Very nice stuff all around, somewhat appley, though mildly so.  Nice esters, dry wood, very creamy, engaging mouthfeel.  Top notch stuff and probably getting nothing but better.  Cheesey, tart, funky.1999 bottle drunk 8/13/16This wasnt quite as spectacular as Millennium Gueuze, but still nothing to scoff at.  Brightness a little less intense, but perhaps a tradeoff, as it may have a bit more earthy, subtle funk to it.  Little bit less carbonation, slightly more loose, but still a strong texture to it, with a bit more mustiness and sourness overall.  Rich tannin and wheat-like notes with light lemon-yogurt lingering.  Great even after 17 years...","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Very easy to drink gueuze, if only it were cheaper... or just available here in Canada. Awesome product of course, but as close to the top 50 as this is, I was expecting a bit more distinctive qualities. Undeniable refreshing qualities are helped by the medium-high carbonation which supports a big medium body. Once again thanks to this pleasure provider named hopsrus. This was a 99 bottle.  01 seemed more acidic, fresher with well defined hay flavors, hugely quaffable.  00 was interesting, but had right before hanssens and it really didnt hold a candle. I dont think it deserves its 4.2 and its mysteriously the least interesting of the drie fonteinen Ive had the chance to sample. Excellent, but not world-class besides for the drinkability.

The color before decanting a limpid golden orange and after decanting a bemused golden orange with the head a majestic crown upon that vaporous golden orange body which is spumous in texture and a somewhat off white color, and the resultant lace a silky veil to hide the glass from prying eyes. The first aroma that of peaches, sweet and sour, almost astringent, crisp and pleasing to both the ocular and olfactory senses, start is modestly sweet, dry, hints of lemon with the top light but pleasingly so. Finish is amaroidal, but once again pleasingly so, an integral part of the style, a bit of the hops I think shows through at the back of the palate, so very tart it puckers the mouth, but its just part of the majesty of the style, what a treat, and this may be sacrilegious, but I like this Lambic much more than any Ive ever sampled including but not limited to Cantillon.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

344,"2003-08-13",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2008 Bottle Date 11 December 2000.  Sampled May 2004 at the Hopleaf, Chicago.
The aroma is sharp, acidic, and catpee.  The taste is dry, and sour with notes of lemon, grapefruit (which is more pronounced), tannin, subtle vanilla notes, and a sharp herbal grassiness.  There is a somewhat restrained Brett character, but there are notes of leather.  This is a very well integrated beer, it is also quite light, as is expected.  This goes quite well with the mussel apetizer that I am currently having.

Oude Gueuze Vintage 1995: Sampled 2001 at Drie Fonteinen cafe 
I decided to go for broke on the next beer that I ordered at the cafe, so I ordered the 1995 bottling of the Gueuze, which means that the majority of the beer contained therein was at least 8 years old, if not more.  The waitress whisked off to the bar (after making sure that I actually wanted a beer that only came in 750 ml bottles) to request the beer from the bar tender.  The bar tender promptly disappeared down into the cellar.  He appeared again a few minutes later reverently holding the bottle at the proper angle (again about 15-degrees).  The bottle was carefully put in a basket that maintained the angle properly and brought to me.  At this point I was getting giddy with excitement, or was that full day of beer consumption.  Either way I was anticipating the sampling of this one.

The bottle was completely unadorned except for a white paint mark that let one know which way was up (so as not to disturb the yeast).  What surprised me was the fact that the standard Champagne bottle that it was served in was corked with a normal wine cork with no accompanying wire cage or any other restraint.  Despite this the beer made an appropriate popping sound when the cork was drawn.

The beer when poured into the glass was lively with carbonation and had a dark gold to amber hue that was quite clear.  It was quite evident just from the clarity 
of the beer that it had been aging, as it had enough time for the characteristic haze to settle out.  The nose was only slightly acidic, at least for a Gueuze.  The taste was quite similar to the 2000 bottling of the Gueuze, but was quit a bit mellower and overall was perfectly balanced between the contrasting and complementary flavors that make up a Lambic.  As an accompaniment to the meal that I had (a wonderful salmon filet) it was quite nice, with a hint of an alcoholic finish to it that was brought out by the fish.
2000 bottle Vintage, sampled in 2001 at Drie Fonteinen
After I had ordered the Gueuze the waitress went to the bar and requested a one.  The barkeep then pulled out the traditional bottle of Lambic lying at a 15-degree angle in a wicker basket.  The bottle was carefully opened and poured without disturbing the yeast.  The beer when it was set down in front of me displayed a lively carbonation, a gold color, slightly hazy and a thick creamy head.  Even from a distance the aroma was evident; displaying notes of fruit including citrus.  When brought closer for an extended sniff it smelled quite sour with an evident Brett character.  The taste was just about perfect.  It was not as sour as Oud Beersels Gueuze and was incredibly complex, with notes of wood, mustiness, a slight bitterness and almost a hint of what I can only describe as wild mushroom.  This was definitely the best Gueuze I had ever had.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
344,"2003-08-10",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2008 Golden orange in colour, lingering white coloured head, good lacing.  The aroma is acidic, lots of lemon citrus, some sweetness is in here as well, woody with some banana.  The flavour is sharp and tart, high acidity, agian lots of lemon citrus, woody with some pink grapefruit.  Acidic mouthfeel, medium/light body, medium/high carbonation.  Finishes long, sour, acidic and dry.  Very good Gueuze, high sourness and it kicks in right away.  This has aged very well and is very drinkable right now.

344,"2003-08-10",3.8,"(Bottle) Year:1999.  Lemon juice body. Sour... so sour fruity nose. Lemony citrus tartness that lasts to the finish. Excellent introduction to the gueze family.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
344,"2003-08-10",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2004 (750ml 1999 bottle) Sure it's sour, but the sourness is the leading, rather than the overwhelmingly dominant, characteristic, making this superior to any other gueuze I have tried.  Opaque golden body with medium off-white head.  Aroma is mild sweet, horseblanket, strawberry, light banana.  Taste is mild sweet, very sour, horseblanket, yeast, strawberry, other fruitiness.  Light, bubbly, acidic body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"

344,"2003-07-03",4.7,"I had four vintages of the Oud Gueuze and they all varied quite a bit in character. I sampled the one they had on tap in June 2003, and the 97, 95 and 96 vintages.  The best was the 96 which was the softest and more complex.  Each had a beautiful golden colour with high carbonation leading to a brilliant white champagne head.  The younger vintage had an acidic nose that was slightly more pronounced than the aged gueuze vintages.  These beers were puckeringly sour and heavy with pine, horsey and lactic notes.  They were dry refreshing beers.  The tap gueuze had more rough edges than the vintages but they were all still smoother than Cantillon's and Girardin's gueuzes, although not quite as rounded as Hansen's Oud Gueuze.  Of the vintages, the 96 was the softest and most complex.  Not only was the acidity and complex gueuze flavour levels higher but it smoothed out perfectly and had wonderful long lasting round finish.  Drie Fontenen, in Beersels just outside of Brussels is a must stop for any beer enthusiast.  Each of the gueuze vintages that I had were different enough to warrant it's own entry and each would have scored between 4.5 and 4.7.  The beers at Drie Fontenen are amongst the best in the world.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
344,"2003-07-01",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2004 Golden yellow with a massive foamy head and intricate lace. Intense sour aroma really smacks you in the face with notes of hay, horse stable, and sour lemon. I don't really have the vocabulary for this kind of a gueuze. Very sour and very good. Strong notes of earth, grass, and hay. Light bodied despite the strong flavor. Refreshing.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
344,"2003-06-23",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2004 Haxy yellow color. Sparkling at the tongue. Tart aroma, oaky. Quite typical gueuze taste also, but not acidic or sharp. Full flavors, very good balanced. Long lingering palate. This is a very good gueuze.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
344,"2003-06-22",3.8,"Bottled. Hazy golden colour. Acidic lemony aroma. Clean maltiness. Firm, drinkable and refreshing with balanced acidity. Perhaps less complex than Girardin and Cantillon, but still a great beer.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
344,"2003-06-20",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2005 Bottled 04-04-2002 (sampled 12-02-2004). The cork popped spontaneously. Cloudy orange/amber coloured, yeast floating around, thick head. Strong and typical gueuze nose, overwhelming but good. Flavour is not as strong, but well balanced. Smooth sour finish. Very nice gueuze.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
344,"2003-06-01",4.3,"Like a smooth wave the sharp tang of this geuze hits the sides and back of your tongue, recedes quickly, but leaves a nice sourness, which lingers until your next blissful sip.  This is the kind of experience that creates daydreams of walking into a lambic glade and just inhaling!  Excellent.","Albion, Michigan, USA","hoppygrrrl"
344,"2003-05-30",4.6,"Cork blows off. Huge white head develops, slowly diminishing, leaving the most impressive(thick!) lace ever seen. Golden body, rather full. Aroma; acetic, citrus, woody, wee hint of sweet. Taste; sour, lemony, dry. Great. Yes, 5% ABV.","Skørping, DENMARK","Dalle"
344,"2003-05-11",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2005 After many years, I venture into the basement. . . A thick layer of dust consumes me, sweeping over me, the dust and dirt become familiar - like a friend.  This place is perfect, no need for clearing/tidying up. . . Everything is in the order I like.  Here I find the a roasted gueze. . . dry, a lingering flavour that clings to the palate and doesnt stop getting better.  A tart spider web of flavours, hay, green apples, totally consuming, beautiful. 8/5/10/5/17

2005 Lambic Festival at Deliahs Chicago (sample of a 2002 [75% Girardin 3 yr, 25% Boon 2 yr], 750 mL bottle): Shimmering yellow gold haze; thin ring of ivory bubbles.  Entrancing aroma: sour white grape skins, iron, cracked fresh wheat, lemon grass and floral honeycomb.  A light acidity lingers in the nostrils.  Irony, metallic flavours crawl over the tongue while a sour grape acidity tries to take over.  The metallic notes win in the finish, but not before cracked peppercorns and bitter citrus notes show up in the softly carbonated bubbles.  Didnt quite live up to the amazing aroma, but a treat no less. 9/4/7/4/16","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
344,"2003-05-04",4.4,"Hazy yellow with Chablislike shine. Very thick, very stable head for a gueuze. Nose gives 'horseblanket', leathery - leather soap, old wood, sulphur, malonate, lactic acid, tarragon. Quite sour taste, very outspoken sour green apples. There IS some sweetness, virtually covered by the acids. Lemony finish. Very sparkling, as mineral water. Very good REAL gueuze - it's average... compared to the Millenium.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
344,"2003-03-29",3.9,"Pours hazy golden in color with plenty of tight little bubbles and a heavy dose of sediment.  Barnyardy with hay, cheese, apples, lemons and a touch of smokiness in the finish.  One of the better gueuzes I've had and well worth tyring this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
344,"2003-01-05",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2005 Feb 2004 bottling. Head is initially huge, fizzy/frothy, white, fully lasting. Hazy light amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket), lightly malty (toasted grain), with notes of lemon, sour apple, grape leaf, flowery meadow, and cask wood. Flavor is moderately sweet, heavily acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, heavily acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, lightly astringent. Wow, Armand just keeps getting better at his craft.  This is gonna age like a champion...cant wait til this is 3 or 4 years old.  This is the best lambic maker remaining IMHO.



1999 bottle. Head is initially average sized, fizzy, off-white, fully lasting. Hazy dark yellow, bottle conditioned. Aroma is heavily yeasty (barnyard), lightly malty (toasted grain), with notes of lemon, sour apple, and cask wood. Flavor is moderately sweet, heavily acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, heavily acidic. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation. This sample was damned fizzy, but otherwise displayed all the makings of a top shelf gueuze...superb balance (very sour, but not too much so) and beautiful rustic nose. (8/4/9/3/17=4.1)","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
344,"2002-12-21",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2007 Holy cow...the similarities to Hanssens are remarkable in the woodiness, but this has a bit more tart/sweet alternating flavors, and it has more ""stinky cheese"" but isnt overloaded in that department as I think Boon tends to be. Highly recommended.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
344,"2002-12-11",4.2,"Bottled 12/11/00, so this one is exactly two years old. BOOM! says the cork. Sharp, biting cidery sourness in the nose. With a careful pour, the head is only medium-size,  and pure white, receding pretty fast. Orange-straw body; hazy. Since I have sold my soul to Ratebeer, I always look forward to gueuze, and after an exhausting day, this is preordained to be the highlight. Fairly mild body, with lingering sourness. Nice complexity, with the flavors melding together wonderfully. Well-carbonated. Leaves a slightly sweet fruity taste in the mouth once the sourness dies off. Damn, you guys have ruined me for regular beer.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
344,"2002-11-16",4.6,"ohhh yeah this is  a good un and one of my favourite gueuzes. bottled nearly 3 years ago. the cork almost made a crack in the ceiling. blends rich, round honey, fruit and oak flavours with plenty of sourness and a reallllly dry, hoppy (for a gueuze) and herbal (oregano? marjoram?) finish that doesnt finish - i dunno what you call that.  sour enough to compete with the best of em, but not a thin, sharp sourness, more of a blended, rounded sourness if that makes sense. smells immediately oaky, like rodenbach, along with banana, haystacks, rotten meat - but no public toilet stink like cantillon or boon. beautiful hazy orange colour with a fine creamy head that sticks. this is a great thing, a gueuze that you can not only admire but also drink without scaring yourself with every sip.  note: mine was labelled as 5%, not 6.5% as here - if you look carefully on the jpg up in the corner there it also says 5% so I dunno.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
344,"2002-11-12",4.2,"Oh man, I had my first sample and almost yelled, ""This is the shit!"" Smooth easy sourness, woody and hay aromas and something off bone dry thats about as challenging as a martini with a lot more pay off. Not the best gueuze on the table but pretty darn good.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
344,"2002-11-08",2.2,"preface - after having a brief discussion with Frank Boon (Belgain brewer extrordinaire) I found that I was remiss in having let the sedimental yeast mix as I poured this. He mentioned that this contained an extremely bitter taste. Thus I think my entire experience was skewered. I found it more bitter than any grapefruit I have EVER had, rather thin, which I suspect is much to the style. Overall I wasnt able to appreciate it, but would love to have another chance. Sad that I had this hand transported to me from Belgium.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
344,"2002-10-22",2.8,"2001: Old rotten hay with a horrid aftertaste.  I nearly fell over in a fit of gagging!  I dont know what it was but it wasnt good.  2000: Sour mash with a slight of the skunk straw taste found in the newer vintage.  1999: Its truly amazing what a couple years of aging can do for a gueuze.  This year was much more smooth with an understated citrus tones of lemon and tangerine.  Much better than its newer sibilings.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
344,"2002-10-21",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2004 rating is for 2002 vintage sampled in 2004: This is the 75% Girardin & 25% Boon blend, a strong and powerfully sour gueuze with superb horseblanket nose and amazingly dry finish.  The aftertaste was stronger than all other vintages.  This is the year that you want to seek out, and the 2003 (50% Girardin & 50%Lindemans) coming in at a close second.  Remaing notes were taken 10/22 
1999 VERSION:  Smooth, slightly complex with hints of barnyard and peppery spices.  Sugary palate that ends with a sourness of 6.5 on a scale of 10.   2000 VERSION: Hazy and slighly skunky. Seemed like a bad sample. Didn't even fit into the progression of the vintages that we sampled.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
344,"2002-10-20",4.1,"(1999) Hazy golden/light orange. Thin but lastung head, moderate lace. Nose of oak, grapes, slight wet barn, must, acid hits and more. Medium bodied, smooth acidic character with hints of sweet apple in the middle as well as a bit of cotton candy? Finish bumps up the sourness to make for an addicitve brew. I blow at describing these. I know there must be intricate qualities in here that I just cannot detect or put into words. Good chit though:)","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

344,"2002-08-22",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2003 Rating shown for 1997 vintage.
1999 vintage - 9 August 2003 Clearly fresher and younger that the older vintages. Dark honey hazy translucent colour with that famous wet rubber mattress aroma. Medium light body, Besides the classic yeast grapefruit citrus sour flavours, this time I got a hint of freshly picked runner beans. Rated at 4.0. 

1997 vintage sampled August at Restaurant Drie Fonteinen. Medium size short lasting white head over a medium gold crystal clear colour. Wood, damp musty cellar yeast, grape vinegar and grapefruit sour, and wet rubber mattress  aroma. Medium body with tantalizing complex palate. Mild grapefruit/cider sour start with woody and vinous dry sherry character. Fades slowly to mellow yeasty bitter and cider sour middle reminiscent of a vintage Norman cider. Finish is mild dry  and refreshing. A very good and interesting example of this style of beer. 
1995 vintage is considerably mellower and smoother and even less acidic than the 1997 vintage. Aromas and flavours include major wood and vinous petroleum character (vintage port, mature dry sherry). The yeast is much milder and  very complex. Needs further research. Overall rates ~0.3-0.4 points higher than the 1997 vintage.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"
344,"2002-08-21",4.5,"This was a March 1995 bottle. That is seven and a half years old. It has a mature smell with a clear portery aroma. The taste is sour, portery with a lovely buttery taste. Absolutely smashing. I have added the look of the bottle to the appearance, it looked like it had been in a cellar for, well seven years! This was a religious experience.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
344,"2002-07-25",3.8,"impressive lambic.  strong aroma that lets you know it is going to be good an sour.  the taste does not let you down, it is mouth puckeringly good.  so many flavors in the sourness that i was not prepared and can not describe them all.

344,"2002-07-06",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2011 Wonderful acidic apples and champagne-like effervescencePeppery hay appears in some vintages, adding to the complexity, and my personal enjoyment...Tenderness in some cases, powerful hay and tartness in some othersA clean, flavorful gueuze apéritif...

In a comparison with a Girardin Black Label, it appeared dustier and yeastier, despite its overall cleanliness for a gueuze...Drier as well, with tons of carbonation, and bountiful citrus fruit...Do not forget though, that this means it is an otherworldly haystack...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

344,"2002-03-25",4.1,"Cloudy lemon color with a high degree of carbonation. A somewhat musty/oake aroma. Taste is slightly salty (from the bitterness?) and citrusy with a bitter hop snap that fades nicely.","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"
344,"2002-03-12",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2005 Good nose, thick head that disappears fast because of sourness of the beer. A  bit too young (1999) for a geuze, therefore too much carbon gas. That disturbes the intense taste of the beer. Nevertheless a good geuze. Re-rate, same brew, 16 months older. Strong aroma with honey, citrus, oak, maybe a bit sulphury. Very complex flavor, rounded and not too sour: hops, grapefruit, oak, honey, pine trees and pineapple. Rather vinous, well rounded geuze. Finishes with some hoppy and oaky bitterness. Rating is up by a few points.
Oude geuze 99, painted bottle. Last geuze without lambic from 3F. Totally different beer from the ""ordinary"" 99 The aroma has chewing gum and cheap lemon sweets, strangely enough. Just a touch of wood. Well rouded flavor, even a bit of rest sweetness present. Wood coming up in the aftertaste. Lemon. Dusty aftertaste. An incredible balance. Mybe a bit on the thin side. Great beer, no doubt about it, but Ive tasted better:

344,"2002-01-01",4.5,"Cantillon is the beer lovers gueuze; Girardin is the gueuze lovers gueuze; Hanssens in the thinking mans gueuze; Cuvee Rene is a really screwed-up gueuze; but Drie Fonteinen is the session gueuze.  Yes, its expensive in the US and quite strong, but the combination of hardcore, funky, sour gueuze with smooth maltiness and hint of sweetness in the finish makes this the most emminently quaffable of the oude gueuzes.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
