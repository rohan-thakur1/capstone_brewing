2931,"2016-07-03",3.7,"Style et résumé: Cidre fermier. 
Comment: Bouteille de 750ml vintage 2013.
Portrait: Un cidre jaune trouble. Un nez décurie, de brett avec des pommes bien discrètes. Une bouche acide avec des saveurs détable, de fumier et de bois. Les pommes sont les grands oubliées de cette dégustation. Produit singulier fort agréable. 
Note:  7+/10","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
2931,"2016-05-27",3.9,"pours hazy/almost cloudy light golden with a large bubbly white head offering a rather poor retention, some spotty lacing patterns. woodsy leathery bretts, under-ripened apples - mostly tart granny smiths; some ground cherries as well; über-dry and mineral white wine, including wood and tannins; silage, ginger, white pepper, herbs, light to medium acidity - malic, citric and lactic; tons of minerals. bright carbonation, light body - thin; bone dry herbal-citrusy-woodsy finish. basandere offered a bit more funk with over - a tough - 0g/L of sugars. very nice basque farmhouse cider.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2931,"2016-05-25",3.7,"Bottle - Vintage 2013 - Lots of sweat and funk. Clearish cloudy gold with a bit of a crown. Lots of funk, carbonation is overpowering with horse blanket in the finish and quite dry.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2931,"2016-04-02",3.9,"(Gusher!) Pours a very clear golden with no head, bubbles or lacing. Nose is of barnyard and leather. Not too fecal/poopy but still a little. Taste is of brett leather and ultra dry. Some apple flesh. Ultra tannic, too. Light to medium body with a moderate carbonation. Drying as fuck tannins. A nice experience in dryness!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2931,"2016-03-22",3.9,"(Bouteille): Un liquide qui transporte décidément son sac de pomme. Le bouquet qui laccompagne est très fermier, vineux et cuiré avec des bulles agitées et une sécheresse brutale.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
2931,"2016-03-14",3.9,"(Vintage 2013. 6% selon le producteur et 7.3% selon le laboratoire de la SAQ) Ce liquide jaune sent les pommes qui roulent dans une étable, les levures indigènes, le foin et la paille, le cuir et les charcuteries slaves. La bouche est moins complexe, très sèche, faite de cuir fruité, avec pommes et vin blanc, excessivement terreuse. Au palais, le liquide est vineux et légèrement pétillant. En finale, cest sec à la puissance 10: dans ma bouche se trouve le désert dAtacama et ses 10500 kilomètres carrés de superficie.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2931,"2016-03-12",4.1,"Bottle, shared. Clear pale gold pour with huge frothy white head. Aroma is super farmy, cow plop, wet hay, sileage, faint apple aroma, nice and grassy. Taste is farmy, nice acidity, very light sweetness, light alcohol. Palate is dry, not as dry as basandere but pretty dry nonetheless, nice fluffy carbonation. Excellent.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2931,"2016-01-24",3.8,"Bottle (750 ml) at home. 2013 bottle. Split 4-ways. Slightly hazy golden with a medium white head, low retention. Aroma is nicely funky and farmy with musty notes, oak and mild spiciness. Taste is less stellar than the aroma with the same features but all toned down a bit except the oak presence which is much more present. Medium body. Some carbonation. Tannic mouthfeel. Bone dry finish. One of the shortest aftertaste I have ever had in any product. Alcohol show up a bit. Its pretty good, but I preferred the Bordatto Basandere we had just before that was wilder and funkier while still being quite dry. A very good cider nonetheless. Im glad I still have a few bottles of this one!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2931,"2015-04-01",3.9,"Bottle at Capitol Cider, pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Nose is quite funky, with dry apples and a little funky citrus zest. Flavour is medium funky and light-to-medium sweet, with a great balance between the two. Finishes leathery and barnyardy. Excellent stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2931,"2014-09-24",4.0,"2011 bottle from Thirst Wine Merchants. Pours clear gold with small white head. Aroma is robust oak and funky yeast with roasted apple, minerals, white grape, and band-aid. Some spice and alcohol on the nose. Taste is lush, tannic apples with stone fruit tartness and some sweetness fading into big oak barrel tannins. High acidity and super rustic. Soft mouthfeel. A delicious, robust cider with nice sense of terroir.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
2931,"2014-09-01",3.7,"Bottle at Right Proper shared with Kenny, Owen, Bobby, pleasure drinking with you! Cloudy yellow color, fizzy. Aroma is very herbal, mixed fruits, flowers. Taste is tart, tangy, herbal. Nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2931,"2014-04-17",3.9,"Bottle bought through Riktig Cider. Pours hazy pale golden with a small fizzy golden head that quickly dissipates without leaving any trace on the glass. Smell is fruity and funky with smashed apples, damp basement, cobwebs, hay, dry soil, leather and apple skins. Taste is tiny sour and slightly funky with sour apples, apple skins, dry soil, hay, barnyard and dry wood. Mouthfeel is very dry, tannic astringent and light bodied. Finish is tiny sour and tiny funky with smashed apples, cobwebs, hay, dry soil, leather, cobwebs and dry wood. Crazy dry and crazy refreshing!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
2931,"2014-04-08",4.4,"750mL split with GT2. Beautiful color, high carbonation. Aroma is woody chardonnay, light flowers/gardenia, raspberry, fresh dough, fresh;y baked bread, immediately gives off exactly the notes I want in cider. Taste is white wine, barrel character is high, very dry, some yellow apple and raspberry. One of the best ciders Ive ever had. Feels like Im back in France.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
2931,"2014-04-08",4.0,"> Norman style starfruit and smoked ham ultra dry cidre
[ Bottle ][ Beer Study Chapel Hill NC ][ 75cl ][ $16 ][ Lost Abbey Teku ][ 4/8/14 ]
>> After a stubborn champagne cork, the cider yields a chill hazed, glowing deep starfruit golden with lasting champagne carbonation. Gorgeous. Nose off the bat is the best of the best from Normandy that I remember with smoked ham, powerful starfruit, musty basement, fresh barrel, cellar. Taste is very dry with a woody, dusty, tannic finish that isnt papery. Not as rich and juicy as Id like, but there is zero sugar remaining. Thankfully, there isnt any sour green apple like I was expecting. Really, it isnt too funky either. Very different from Isategi on the sour/funk scale and more in the top tier Normandy vein. Really enjoyed this one.
>!< perhaps a bit too dry and woody","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2931,"2013-09-28",3.4,"2011 bottle from Chamber St. Wines. I think it was around $14. Bottle just about starting to sweat. My arms are too short for the theatrics.

Fluted tulip. Short pours. Strong soda fizz envelops the glass. Settles into a clear & golden, if slightly dulled color. Barely active.

Smell is musky & hay-ish. A blend of what seems like sweet/savory apples & a few more on the sour side. Juicy. Soft funk. Rose & earth. Subtle trail of yeast & alcohol.

Taste is of dry, woody, vanilla laced apples. Just a smidgen of tang, & not even sour. Good acid. Mashed apples. Tastes a little English. Yeastier/creamier as it goes. Carbonation is just a hair under stubborn. The alcohol is there. Beastly sulfites.

A little rough towards the end of the bottle, but I appreciated it not being flagrantly sour.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
2931,"2013-07-09",3.1,"Bottle at Olympic Provisions in Portland. A sparkling sidra from the Basque area of France. Gamey & stinky foot / funky cheese rind aroma with measured, straightforward apple cider juiciness. Low sweetness, high acid, light body. Simple apple juice core with floral, musty, malic, peppery goat cheese notes.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2931,"2013-05-18",3.5,"Bottle. Pours a clear pale gold with a white head that dissipates quickly and completely. Aroma has mainly notes of sweet apples with a bit of acid and earthiness. Flavor has sweet apples up front but becomes more mealy and earthy with a touch of acid.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
