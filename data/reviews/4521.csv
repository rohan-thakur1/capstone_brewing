Rustic and complexly malty nose of butter cookie, piecrust, cracker dough, along with a plentitude of hop-derived fennel candy, pepper and lemon oil. Perfect touch of yogurty yeast and minerals. Soft body is draped in creamy carbonation. Vividly defined peppery hops inundate the palate alongside richly textured malt which unleashes a host toasty and cookielike notes. Bracing minerals mirror the profoundly refined grassy bitterness which exerts itself forcefully. Dabs of lemon candy drip from the nectar-filled hops. Malt continually looms with lush and bouncy toasted hay and a well-measured sweetness that evokes candied pecans, toffee and some discernible kettle caramelization. Potently brisk finish is liberally dosed with palate-cleansing minerals and a spicy hop punch of candied fennel. An evocative, soulful, old-fashioned světlé leák embodying the rustic charm you might expect from such masterfully decocted malt centered around open fermentation and the brewerys divine well water.

Flavor: Malts come up to balance the rich noble hop character; the malts sustain almost throughout the beer with their pleasant, semi sweet presence, striking a perfect bittersweet balance until the very finish. A lingering noble hop release finally dries things up. Amazing to me how these Czech pilsners get so much malt character out of a 4% beer.

Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at Koutland, Pilsen, Czech Republic
The look: Clear golden blonde body with a medium white head
To me a typical Czech Světlý 11° and below is: Well malted body with lots of smooth cereals and a light fresh honey sweetness flavour.  Some fruity notes (more fruity notes than in the 12°+) with mostly citrus fruits and a little lemon.  The finish is somewhat herbal and citrusy with but unlike the 12°+ there is only a hint of the dry grassy bitterness usually associated with noble/Saaz hops.  Bitterness is mild and does not really play a big role in the overall flavours spectrum.  A light meringue sensation and an overall freshness impression..  Carbonation is typically very soft.  These beers are low in intensity but very refreshing and drinkable in scarily large quantities.
This one: As above but everything multiplied by 2 (despite being so very light).  Like an unsweetened lemon pie.  Super citrusy/lemony nice tartness.  THE refreshing Světlé of my Czech Republic trip.  Extraodinary.  Drinkable in extra large quantities and god knows I did.  I went back a few times to Koutland to drink more of it just to make sure that it was so good (for the science)","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4521,"2008-03-26",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2009 My Bottom Line:
This scintillating Světlé Výčepní sports a tireless equilibrium of grassy, spicy hops and honeyed bready malts in a crunchy and ever-so-quenching vehicle. Another smashing quaffer by Kout.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A frothy head of foam mushrooms atop the pale golden.
-Some citrusy fruitiness precedes the hops wooden bitterness.
-The body is slender (but plumper than most 10-degrees) and leads to impressive drinkability levels.
-The maltiness in this one is a tad more clearly expressed than in the 12-degree.
