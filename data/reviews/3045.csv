Full body, cloying, with a sticky mouthfeel. Very long, warming, but pleasant, although very sweet finish. Hard to elaborate anyway, but interesting and unique experience. As it got warmer and opened up completely, showed elegant orange peel bitterness, especially in the finish. Probably it would be even better, more complex after a couple of years.

3045,"2015-09-06",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2015 50cl bottle served in a snifter. Pours a rich, oily dark amber to garnet colour with no carbonation. Aroma is powerful vanilla, dried fruits, honeyed fruits and sweetness with a clearly high alcohol content. Taste is upfront toffee, with roasted almonds, a fleeting hint of coffee, chocolate, caramelized cashew nuts and very rich Christmas cake. Almost tastes bourbon barrel aged with the level of buttery vanilla richness evident in both the aroma and taste. The only slight criticism (other than the expected lack of carbonation) is the level of sweetness - It needs an extra profile to detract from the sweetness which I think that the barrel aged versions (tobacco?) would achieve with the addition of an earthy or peatiness which I would expect to achieve a more harmonious balance. The closest competitor to this I have tried is Samichlaus which is a simple malt bomb in comparison and a 1986 Thomas Hardy which was too oxidised and a little to heavy on the Madeira as a result. All in all this is a fantastic experience beer and I will look to seek out the other versions.","West Midlands, ENGLAND","ABT_S54"

3045,"2015-03-15",4.8,"Aromat: mega intensywny i złożony. Winny (sherry, porto), wyraźnie alkoholowy, estrowy (wiśnie, śliwki), słodki, miodowy, wręcz gęsty. Karmel, chleb, nieco chmielu ziołowego.

Barwa ciemno czerwona, rubinowa, klarowna - śliczna. Piana grubo pęcherzykowa, niewielka i natychmiast opadająca, jednak przy takiej mocy to nie dziwne.

Klasyczne, ale s tuningowane do oporu. Niewielka goryczka, delikatna i krótka. Wyraźnie oleista (w smaku wręcz likierowa) konsystencja. Tęga pełnia, praktycznie zerowe wysycenie, lekko szczypiące odczucie w ustach i wyraźnie alkoholowy, rozgrzewający przełyk finisz. Jest to jednak bardzo przyjemne odczucie.

A - The most sherry / port looking beer. Lots of mahogany and blood red. Totally still, great clarity but no head / bubbles at all. 

S - Nose is really awesome. It has that super insane caramelized sugar due to that very long boil. Tobacco, bay leaves, hearty fruit cake. 

T - This is incredibly sweet but not overpowering or like I cant finish a glass but in this maple syrup drizzled on biscotti with capers and dried figs put into a blender with a dash of vanilla, cocoa and horse antlers. wow.

M - Very thin, very slick, oily and the booze is not overpowering, nor do oak tannins totally overwhelm. 

O - Its great that its flat, its oily. The touch of child tears and zebra snot really pull it together. Lets keep this up, babies.

Nose has intense port wine notes with loads of dark, dried fruits, cognac, wood, hints of caramel and the classic caramelized Norwegian bread spread ""brunost"" (""brown cheese""). Taste holds lots of caramelized brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, wood, hints of bitter grass and the ""brunost"" again. Intense. The vanilla re-surfaces with some dark sugary notes in the aftertaste, which is long and borderline sticky. This is more a dessert than a dessert wine substitute, but I quite like it.

3045,"2010-07-21",3.1,"In short: A simplistic syrupy beer with caramel, maple syrup and booze.
How: From a 375ml bottle at Montreal Mondial de la Bière 2010.  Side-by-side with Argento (Silver Label) version
The look: Clear amber body with almost no head
In long: Nose of caramel, maple and booze.  Taste follows up with the same elements.  Lots of caramel, lots of maple syrup, lots of booze, some glue.  No hops noticeable.  The carbonation is minimal and the beer feels very sticky syrupy.  This is a simplistic beer that offers no complexity and with a very low drinkability level.  I thought the Argento (Silver Label) had a lot going for it but this Oro was rather boring.  Drinkable in small quantity.  Overrated.  I was told that Oro is not only the name of this beer but it is also a palindrome.  I assume its a stadium where an Italian soccer team plays.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3045,"2010-06-26",4.3,"Another huge thanks to SHIG for these Italian beauties. Thanks Shawn! Pours clear copper with zero head and tree trunk legs slowly sludging down the inside edge of the glass. The aroma is similar to the copper and silver with smooth rich blended sugary dark fruitiness to go along with ribbons of caramel and sherry-ness. The taste is rich and smooth and succulent and seems silkier than the other variants. Yum indeed. I get rich smooth blended prunes, plum juice, figs and sugar coated apricot. In behind the rich sweet smooth fruitiness are notes of creamy caramel candy and a sense of wood, earthiness and smooth warming booze. I love these beers!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3045,"2010-06-21",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2011 Manuelle at Ma Che Siete shared a bottle with me and I assume Mortlach as well since there was a dude at the other end of the bar with a glass from the same night of his rating.  This was by far the best glass of Xyauyu I have had!  Perfectly oxidized, medium fruitiness all around, creamy silky big sweet malts- barely cloying, and just easy to sip on.  Very nice! 

Shared with Dany and Ryan at Mondial 2010. Pours a clear amber mostly still with some sticky legs.  Aroma is very sweet with lots of maple syrup, way less oxidized crap that the regular version had, mostly fruity esters, some caramelized malts.  Flavor is light earth, mostly maple sweetness, some honey, light soy oxidation but not too bad, fruity ester oxidation still not out of control, a get a slight woody paper note, and some port wine and sherry.  A bit of heat at the end.  Not bad.  My favorite of all the Xyauyu so far.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

The grail of barley wine. This wonderfully crafted, had it side by side with silver label, and this beer is a tad more pronounced in the aroma and flavors.

3045,"2010-03-07",3.8,"500ml. 2006 vintage. 13%. Pours a darker orange which can look more amber or ruby in different lighting. Flat of course; I wasnt expecting any carbonation after having the Silver and Copper labels recently. I like the aroma on this one the best; when I pulled the cork out, a pleasant banana aroma filled the immediate vicinity. Now in the snifter Im getting some nice caramel/toffee, molasses, honey, sweet malt, a little alcohol but not ""boozy"" per se. Yum, the flavor in this one is easily the best of the series: Quite fruity with again the sweet glaze/syrupy flavors. Kind of like a brandy, kind of like a port. Definitely a fermented winegrape element is present in the flavor. Its very  sweet, but manages to stay just under the cloying threshold. Mouthfeel is oily, medium viscosity, sticky finish; again, just like a port. I definitely like this one the best out of the series. I think this is mostly because this one helped me understand and appreciate what this series is supposed to be (and be about). I mean this is literally a ""barley wine"". That is, this is wine, not beer. Wine that happens to be fermented from grain instead of grapes. When I look at it in the context of wine, and through a filter of Italiana, I can really start appreciating this and liking it a lot. But yes, in that context; not in the traditional beer context would I easily understand this opus. Overall, very good to excellent.","California, USA","Gypsy19"

Nice.","Malmö, SWEDEN","andersand"
3045,"2010-01-11",4.2,"Gold version. Vintage 2005. Serving date 2009-02-14.

500 ml sturdy bottle. Comes with a small leaflet with some short notes of which I can only understand fragments. Sealed with a regular wine cork. I couldnt find any freshness date on the bottle.

The cork comes off with a minimal pop, indicating low levels of carbonation. The cork really smells more of wine than beer. When poured, the beer has a very nice, glowing amber color with red hues, and is a bit hazy as a result of big amounts of very small, almost microscopic, floaties. The first pour results in a minimal amount of bubbles on top of the liquid, around the edges of the glass. However, this is no head, not even foam-like. Rather, its the kind of bubbles you sometimes get from pouring fruit juice or some wines. The second pour creates no bubbles at all. Actually, I didnt get the beer to produce any bubbles, no matter how hard I swirled my glass. However, when its swirled it clings onto the glass like a cognac or a wine - a great visual quality.

An intense smell of sweet fruits, raisins, and caramel hits the noose, accompanied by a sharp alcoholic twang. Notes of wood (perhaps oak) are there as well. The smell of this one is really heavy, dense and sweet. Its actually more reminiscent of a strong dessert wine, like sherry or port, than beer.

Lots of sweetness in the mouth: Fruits, mostly overripe plums, raisins, molasses and perhaps some brown sugar and honey-like sweetness as well. Theres is also a flavor I have a hard time identifying; the best I can do is describing it as a general candy-like flavor. These massive sweet flavors are balanced by some spices, oak and a more nutty earth flavor. The alcohol is rather prominent and provides a pleasant warmth. In the finish theres more sweet fruits and raisins, but also a gentle but distinct bitterness. Hot alcohol finishes things off. All in all, this one is very reminiscent of a sherry or a port, with big and bold strong vinous flavors, but there is still something about it that is characteristically beer-like.

It has basically no carbonation, and thus its really smooth. Medium body, very viscous and slightly chewy.

This one really pushes the boundaries for beer, and for what beer can be, almost transcending them occupying parts of the realm previously solely reserved for strong and sweet fortified wines. And I would say it could go head to head with any high quality dessert wine - and come out on top - when it comes to food pairings most often associated with sherry, port wines or Madeira - or as an aperitif for that matter. Although, I constantly compare this with wine and use wine as a measure to describe it, I must say its still a beer with some characteristics you probably wouldnt find in a wine. But considering how far away this is from your average ale, or barleywine for that matter, I dont think I can see my self being in the mood for this one that often. I guess its for that ""special occasion"" or when youre in the mood for something out of the ordinary, and in small amounts (I tried about 2/3 of a bottle and that was a bit much I think)
