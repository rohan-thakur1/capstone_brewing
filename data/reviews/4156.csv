4156,"2017-06-19",4.1,"Fruity, sweet, honey, very slightly acidic in aroma. Sweet, honey, berries, some booze, almost a slight bitterness (from the fruit?) but the bitterness and boozyness counters the sweetness in a really nice way. First sip I thought it was almost to much going on, quite a powerful mead, but as I got into it I enjoyed it more and more. Medium body. Much fruit, deep purple color seems almost like the clear glass bottle have been colored by the liquid!","SWEDEN","sneakychi"

4156,"2017-03-18",4.2,"375 ml bottle. Served in a snifter, the mead pours a very dark reddish/purple color with no head at all. Aroma is nice, it smells like blackberry jam, blackberries, honey and a bit of booziness. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the blackberry jam flavor being stronger compared to the others. Theres also a bit of earthiness, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full and a bit syrupy, and its also smooth and easy to drink with low carbonation. I think its a pretty good mead, but with that being said Ive liked everything Ive tried from Schramms so far. Definitely worth trying! $24.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

Very rich but even and not in your face with any booze, which is nice.Jam, jam and more jam as sweet fruitiness comes at you from everywhere. Not syrupy or cloying and with light wood and earth notes to balance, gently. Modest acidity mostly balances and fruity jam and light black pepper lingers long. Very clean and with no alcohol.

Thanks Theresa for the bottle. 
This was poured into a wine glass. 
The appearance was a bright red color with a slim white - ness of a cap of bubbly head. There wasnt any lacing whatsoever. 
The smell had a decent sweet to tart blackberry that lightens a nice plum - like aroma. 
The taste was semi - sweet with a nice light balanced acceptable tartness to taste. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation came across fairly smooth and nice.

4156,"2014-04-13",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2014 Big berry and honey smell with some booze. Taste was berry jam with a significant alcohol taste to it. More of a general berry flavor to me; it just doesnt scream ""blackberry"" specifically when I take each sip.

4156,"2014-01-07",3.6,"Bottle. The pours deep purple. Completely still, no head. The aromas a bit hot and boozy. Some vanilla-soaked berry skin. Rich dirty blackberry, red grape. Not as jammy as the other Schramms Ive tried. The taste is blackberry juice. Fruit leather. A bit hot and spicy. Dirt-covered berry skin. Dry, acidic finish. Full body, soft carbonation. Good, but not at the level of what Schramms capable of.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4156,"2013-12-26",4.1,"37.5cl bottle, courtesy of my sister 15_2_Kuhnhenn, pours with a clear rutty red amber body that leaves behind thin legginess when swirled. The aroma pulses rich cherry and blackberry fresh cut fruit notes, a red wine like tannin sensation and then honey nuanced booze. The taste is on the thin side and erupts with ripe rich fresh blackberries lined thickly by tart tannin fruitiness that gives this a fruity dry red wine sort of feeling. Within the blackberry flavor Im picking up various fruity to earthy nuances helping tie this together. It ends dry and delicious.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Darker, crimson reddish glows with some mellow maroon hues on the bottom and edges. No head, not lacing. Aromas are seedy, more tannic with skin, some gentle oney. Richer seedy raspberry, firm dryness meets the palate. Initial is firmer seedy and fruit blackberry, a bit tart, some gentle honey, apple sweetness. Some nice darkness, seedy, a bit tannic. Middle is gentle sweetnessn honey and blackberry, gentle sweetness. Backend is a bit tannic, dry, tart. Solid stuff, probably one of the better flowing meads. The nose isnt as rich, but its pretty solid stuff, more balanced. Fairly drinkable as a mead. While I love some Blackberry, this one is solid but falls behind the other Schramm offerings for me. Nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
