3886,"2017-06-03",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2017 Clear orange brown with generous, thick nitrous head. Looks fantastic. Caramel and piney hop aroma. Smooth hop flavour as well, fruity but also pretty grassy. The mouthfeel, wow! So smooth!! Like a milkshake, only hoppy. My first IPA on nitro and I will be looking out for more.

3886,"2016-06-18",4.4,"A lingering bitter red IPA. Heavy pepper and herbal spice flavour after a initial burst of citrus. Made with Galaxy and Mosiac hops this red IPA is a staple of the Modus range.
This big beer should be consumed ideally from the Modus Canimal can. A massive 1L can. Drinking one of those bad boys is way to easy, but when the missus says ""you should really cut back to one beer a night"", then this is the beer you should have. And technically, its still one beer.right!","AUSTRALIA","jase3812"

Wonderful fresh tropical amd floral hop aromas, with some lovely sweet dark fruit - berries, raisins (from malt) aromas that balance well. Incredible rich and complex flavors. Toasty caramel with dark fruit malt flavors with a medium tropical hop bitterness with a slight grassiness that balances it all so well. Medium body with a smooth as silk texture and slight but gorgeous alcohol warming. Holy shit this beer is good.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","whoisghost"

3886,"2016-02-12",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2017 Squealer from the brewery. Quite clear, red tinge, minimal white head. Massive stone fruit, passionfruit and earth aromas. Peach, apricots and earth with a solid malt backing. The bitterness is in the front and mid palate without the cloying finish that I tire of in most ipa’s. Rich mouth feel, minimal carbonation. Obvious American influences with the massive passionfruit elements but there is also a big earthy English influence which I like. Love this beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","M_Sack"

Nose is hugely focused on pineapple and pine needles - absolutely punchy as all hell with a nice dose of lychee in there. The taste is brutally bitter sweet with loads of tropical fruits - pineapple, blood orange and a huge amount of juicy lychee.
