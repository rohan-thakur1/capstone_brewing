4405,"2013-07-13",4.7,"On tap at the brewpub. Aroma of toasted malt and coffee. The color is pitch black, no light coming through. Taste is of dark, roasted malt and coffee-ish overtones. Overall, an excellent example of this style. More body and mouthfeel than a Köstritzer Schwarzbier, but not thick or cloying.","Sacramento, California, USA","felsenpils"
4405,"2011-10-27",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub - Pours opaque black with a foamy light tan head. Smells huge and malty, with some coffee and dark chocolate, with some dark bread in the background. Taste is smooth, considering all the flavors mixing here. Chocolate comes through a lot more, and theres a touch of smoke in there, with a clean finish. Powdery mouthfeel, and not too heavy. Very, very good stuff.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
4405,"2011-10-19",3.4,"On tap at Das Bierhaus.  Dark brown with ruby lowlights and a thin tan topper.  Aroma of chocolate, darker roasted malts, coffee and a hint of smoke.  Taste of dark roasted malts, mild chocolate, grains and some coffee.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
4405,"2009-08-03",3.4,"Sampled on draught at the pub: Pours a clear dark brown colour. Caramel and roasted malts on the nose. Taste is pleasent and firm. A little smokiness, mixed in with some milk chocolate and nougat. Overall very satisfying.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
4405,"2009-03-09",3.3,"Pours a deep yet clear nut brown. Aromas of roasted malts and nuts. Flavor is light roasted nuts/hazelnuts/almonds with malt flavor present. Body is light with present carbonation yet light.","Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA","Tripplebrew"
4405,"2009-03-02",3.5,"Tap. Pours a deep brown color. Flavors of roasted malt, chocolate malt, cocoa powder. Medium bodied, roasted and tasty. Nicely done. Cheers to Robert the brewmaster!","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"
4405,"2008-04-16",3.9,"Sep 29, 2007  
Draught at the brewpub. The beer was opaque black with a moderate amount of head. Burnt malt was the dominate flavor and aroma in the beer. Mildly sweet. Very drinkable for a  Schwarzbier.","Valhalla, Minnesota, USA","akevitt"
4405,"2008-04-04",3.9,"Thanks to my wife Heather for picking me up a growler (while in Menomonie) that I shared with friends after a night of bowling.  Powerful roast aroma, with some hints of charcoal as well as light hops.  The knock on this beer is that it is slightly one dimensional.  However, that dimension is extremely well done.  Great stuff.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
4405,"2007-09-02",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2009 Original rating, 9-2-07: 1/2 liter pour on tap at the brewpub. Sharp, coffee-like aroma. Pours a clear, dark brunette with a reddish hue. Large amount of light brown head. Tight bubbles. Produces extensive lacing. Great looking beer. Sharp coffee flavor, as one would expect given the smell. Some citrus. Hoppy. A touch of softer, dunkel-like flavors. Also a bit of dark chocolate and sugary candy sweetness. Light to medium body. Sharp and crisp in the palate. Tastes like a good stout with the appetizing, refreshing palate sensations of a good lager. 7/5/7/4/14::>3.7

<P>Re-rate, 8-7-09: Small pour (approx. 3 or 4 ounces), on tap at the brewpub. Vanilla and carmel coffee aroma. Pours dark brown with tan head. Dark chocolate and burnt malt tastes. Light body typical of Das Bierhaus brews. Fluffy in the palate. 6/3/6/4/13::>3.2

4405,"2007-08-18",4.3,"If it wasnt for Skyview, I wouldnt be able to keep drinking magnificent beers from this slice of Germanic heaven.  Black color with a thick head.  Light aroma of slightly burnt malt.  The taste keeps up the burnt, almost charred, malt profile.  Very chalky mouthfeel.  Slightly salty finish.  Good lord, I could drink it by the gallon.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4405,"2007-08-15",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2008 Thanks to Skyview for hauling back a growler of this most excellent schwarzbier.  Dark black body with a creamy brown head.  Roasted aroma with a salty character.  heavy grainy body with an almost seaweed saltiness to it.    rerate at the pub.  This thing holds up well in a growler, but damn is it amazing on tap.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
4405,"2007-08-11",3.7,"Best Schwarzbier Ever. Great roasted malt aroma with oatmeal.  Flavor is full bodied malt, and very light hops.  It has roasted grain and some coffee and nutty flavor as well.  A black beer, like it should be, and great palate.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
4405,"2007-08-05",4.2,"On draught at the Das Bierhaus in Menomonie, Wisconsin. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind spotty lacing and an off-white ring. Aroma of roasted mixed nuts, toasted dark malt, with a touch of chocolate, coffee and flowery hops. Taste is very light carbonation, medium bodied with mostly a toasted malt and coffee flavor. Finish has a hint of metalic flavor at first, slightly dry, and then a lingering toasted grain malt remains after the finish. No bitterness during or after the finish on this schwarzbier. Well done!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
