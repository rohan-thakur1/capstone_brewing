3919,"2016-10-22",3.9,"Super hazy pale golden coloured body with a nice, three centimetre tall pure white head. Aroma of very light sour grapes, passionfruit, wheat, light sugars and a bit more sourness - nice. Super light-bodied; Strong passionfruit flavours with not much body nor complexity, but a nice sour flavour at first and a very easy-to-drink smooth wheatie taste. Aftertaste shows a nice sour grape and passionfruit flavour with a little coriander seed, but a freshness that is mouthwatering and makes you want to drink even more! Overall, a great beer, and definitely nice to try as the weather got warmer! I sampled this ten ounce pour on draught at the Pourhouse in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 05-June-2015 for CA$4,50.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

3919,"2015-08-07",4.2,"Growler shared by tom10101, many thanks bro! It pours a cloudy yellow with a small white head that leaves some lacing. Nose is of real, natural passionfruit juice. Taste is of passionfruit juice with a perfectly dialed in acidity. Body is light, carbonation moderately high and mouthfeel is juicy. Awesome, really. Like someone mentionned below this is basically just some alcoholic carbonated passionfruit juice but it is so good! I need to move closer to Four Winds, man.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
