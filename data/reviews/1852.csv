1852,"2017-04-15",3.9,"33cl bottle. 
Appearance: clear golden with a 2 finger sized stable offwhite head.
Aroma: malts,flowers, yeast, grains, citrus
Taste: very nicely balanced, itseems sweet but with a good bitterness for a heller bock. It seems a herbal, dried flowers bitterness, with a bit of citrus some warmth of the alcohol, really nicely done, some sweetness of the malts.
Medium body, average carbonation.

Very good brew.","Hoogeveen, NETHERLANDS","RW80"
1852,"2017-04-05",3.6,"Bottle (from hetbiermoment). Pours amber with beige-ish head. The head stays for a long time. Aroma is fruity, malty, sour, berries maybe. Flavor is sweet and bitter, grains, slight cardboard, dryness, grapefruit, some booze, malt, caramel. Finish is really harsh dry, grapefruit bitter. Overall: basically a really hoppy-bitter bock, a lot more bitter than high IBU beers usually, at the same time there are still some bockish notes. Somewhat unique (in a good way), so extra kudos for that.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"

1852,"2015-05-27",3.1,"Never much liked beers that are pure Chinook. The sticky, warming flavor doesnt always agree with me. I do like the yellow/orange fruit flavors the hops have. Its a little too heavy for me.

1852,"2015-05-12",3.5,"The is aroma is overwhelming vanilla and sweet, ending with strong citrus. Tasting sweet, but quickly strong bitterness and a bit sour.
The colour is nice and orange, but the head isnt that strong.

Strong body and texture with a very bitter long finish. Astonishing different from most ""Lenteboks"" and very much appreciated for being different.

For me there is some strange after taste hard to describe: bit like wet soft plastic. A bit too much citrus/bitter without the body to balance it.","NETHERLANDS","Jasperboe"

1852,"2012-05-06",4.0,"Bottle:
Clear orange amber colored beer with a small to medium creamy off white head, which changes quick into a half open lacing. Looks good and the hop aroma already hits the nose. The aromas are a well balanced mix of hops, warm sweeter sticky barleys and malts, citrus, soft nettle, some peach. Taste is also a good hopped and fruity mix and changes gently into a more and more bitter beer. Good bitter hopped, delicious!
A perfect good full bitter hoppy and lighter fruity aftertaste.
Low carbo, soft creamy mouthfeel, full body and a creamy texture.
This must be my favorite lentebok. Maybe because it reminds much of an IPA with the lovely hopped aromas and flavours. Very good.","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"
