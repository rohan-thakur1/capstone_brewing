4198,"2007-05-05",3.7,"Unlabeled bottle sampled on 2/26/07: Pours a slightly hazy dark copper with a wispy-lacing tan head.  Toasty aged dark caramel malty aroma has a touch of German lager yeast.  Body starts fairly full and earthy caramely sweet with some light fruity notes and a touch of bready yeast.  Nicely balanced and true to style.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Light chocolate notes.  The flavor was fruity with some notes of brown apples.  Also notes of ginger bread cookies and golden raisins.  Semi-dry with a moderate bitter finish.  Some warmth.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"

4198,"2007-01-07",3.0,"07.01.07  Growler from New Hope.  Light brown color without much head but this growler is a week or so old.  Some agitation brings forth a small top of loose beige foam.  Aroma is not encouraging, a bit vegetal, murky, tannic, and woody.  The flavor is toasty and full of rich malts, not all of then tasty.  Earthy, hints of peat (probably my imagination), wet dirt (which I like), old herbs, and Goobers.  Mouthfeel is pretty full and moderately astringent and this stuff is reminding me of so many generic _winter beers_ from the various micros of the US (think Smuttynose).  Not nearly as good as Jay Missions dunkel - I wonder if he did this one, too?","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
4198,"2006-12-28",3.8,"On tap at New Hope.  Pours a hazy deep amber with a thin lasting head and nice lace.  Aroma is toffee, sticky sweet caramel, lightly nutty, and hints of herbal hops.  Good full body with lots of toasted malts, caramel malts, and light nutty chocolate with some fruitiness.  Good moderate body and mouthfeel.  Good dark bock, but definitely not a doppelbock which I thought it was going to be- just a darker strong bock.  Nice.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4198,"2006-12-16",3.9,"On tap/growler from New Hope.  Deep reddish brown hazy color that has a small head and a barleywine-ish look to it.  Aroma of lightly roasted grains, a bit of wheat, and some hints of fruit/spices.  Taste is very sweet & Grainy with a chewiness that doesnt disappoint.  Nice bock, pretty damn good winter brew.  Well done by the guys at Triumph.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
4198,"2006-02-05",4.2,"Poured reddish brown with a thick tan head.  Aromas of wheat, cloves, banana, white wine, toffee, caramel and plum.  Taste was dominated by toffee and had hints of coffee and chocolate as well.  Palate was very full with a good balance.  This is an exceptional Bock in my opinion.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"
4198,"2006-02-04",3.5,"Darkest red color ever, wheaty kind of smell, flavor is alcohol, cinnamon, cloves, hops, tastes big for 7%, off white head leaves good lacing.","High Bridge, New Jersey, USA","AdamSkillin"
4198,"2006-02-03",3.8,"2/1/06  New Hope.  Really great and really free.  From a small wooden barrel tapped by the Executive Brewmaster of Triumph.  Bock-tastic.  Much nicer out of the barrel than it was on tap","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","Jine"
4198,"2006-01-25",3.3,"Triumph New Hope. Clear copper body with a silky beige head. Buttery aroma with elements of brown butter and dark butterscotch. Also has notes of dark bread crusts and sweet fruit and candy. Flavor is of toasty Munich malt, medium sweet and clean. Sticky sweet palate. A decent bock overall.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
