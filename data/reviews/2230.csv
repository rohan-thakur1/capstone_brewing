2230,"2017-04-25",4.0,"Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a cloudy amber color with a large white head. The aroma is malt with some citrus hops. The taste is a nice Marzen flavor that follows the nose.","Douglasville, Georgia, USA","ordybill"
2230,"2016-11-28",3.4,"10/8/16. Amber pour with a small khaki head. Light malty aroma, small whiffs of caramel, toasted bread, and crackers. Okay flavor, bready, light maltiness, wisps of caramel. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
2230,"2016-10-13",2.9,"Bottle purchased while on Jekyll Island with family for M&Ds wedding. Pours a clear amber body with thin white ring of lacing. Nose is sweet malt and not much else. Mouthfeel is light bodied with notes of soft malt, light fruit and grain. Bland overall, but not ""bad"" in any way. Also, took home a medal at GABF 2016...","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2230,"2016-10-07",3.2,"Had this back to back with Red Hares take on the style. This isnt as nutty with the malt and a slightly harsh finish.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
2230,"2016-10-07",3.0,"A tad thin for a marine. In fact more a bready lager taste, than a malty caramel octoberfest/marzen style. Taste was okay, very drinkable body though.","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"
2230,"2016-09-29",3.1,"""Octoberfest Light"" would be accurate. Not nearly as malty or sweet as traditional Marzens and no balance or punch to make up for the difference. Super easy drinking but not my favorite Jekyll.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","BCMike22"

BEST BY 01/22/17.

Appearance: Pours a near clear, golden-amber body with a smallish, receding, white head.

Smell: The aroma is rather restrained, just a bit of lightly toasty malts with a backdrop of lager yeast.

Taste: Toffee-tinged, toasty biscuity malts with a scant level of nuttiness. Subdued sweetness. Spicy, floral hops with a light, balancing bitterness. It doesnt exactly dry out, but the finish isnt overtly sweet by any means.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: A solid iteration, it certainly beats the pants of Wild Heavens Autumn Defense.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
2230,"2016-09-10",3.0,"Draft. Orange pour. Malty hint of csramel more amero centric style oktoberfest. Easyish to drink though.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2230,"2016-07-29",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2016 Nice to see this in bottles this year. Clearish amber pour with a minimal ring of foam. Aroma was bready malt, caramel, toasted nuts, earthy hops. Flavors followed suit with sweet, doughy malt, caramel, nuttiness, touch of earthy hops, light bittersweet finish. Medium, plus mouthfeel with lighter carbonation. Very enjoyable marzen, everything you look for.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
2230,"2014-10-17",3.8,"Really enjoyable for the style. Medium heaviness with plenty I flavor, some straw grassiness and mid to full malt backing. All around, its really enjoyable and hitting the spot nicely. I dig it","Florida, USA","tricyclist"
2230,"2014-10-15",3.8,"Pours a clear, dark, coppery amber with a thick though not persistent buff head. Strong aroma has malty, pear and apple notes, tempting with a whisper of autumn. Flavor is a mouthful of Oktoberfest - malty and fruity notes will have you hearing polka music and yearning for lederhosen or a dirndl. Firm, smooth texture has some good fizz and leaves a fruity, slightly woody finish. Prost from Georgia to everywhere!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
2230,"2014-10-11",4.4,"Growler @ Cumming Growler. Light copper color, tall foam. Toasted grains, oak, earthy hops. Tastes of lightly toasted malts. Finishes with the flavor of Autumn. (4209)","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
