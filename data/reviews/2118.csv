Gorgeous ale, cannot say much on aroma because of heavy pub atmosphere (rating based on others) but taste is excellent. Well balanced, very drinkable, bitterness is just enough.

Jännän pehmeä ja melkein maksan makuinen (!) ja kuitenkin humaloitu, sitruksinen ja hedelmäinen. Mallasta myös, ehkä sekoitan maltaan maksan makuiseksi?
