1407,"2015-12-23",3.6,"Old rating. On cask at Zum Schlüssel.  Smooth caramelly beginning. More depth than the regular Alt, caramel. Brown sugar, not too dry. Lots of fruitiness with a dark caramelly body. Nice stuff, nice balanced between bitter- and sweetness. Nice.","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"
1407,"2015-10-24",4.2,"Has a dark brown, vibrant, mohagony appearance, underneath a solid, beige, bubbly head, leaving back solid webs of lacing.

The aromas offer the typical Schlüssel keg skunkiness, resulting from young yeast, with an acidic sour whiff to it, coating up herbal hops and whole-grain bread, while the malts remain unusual subdued underneath the skunk.

Offers a very smooth mouthfeel, with a mineralic softness to it, adding to the dough bread qualities of the beer. Although it ends utmost dry, the beer remains easy drinkable, due to its great, clean finish.

Tastes of rustic, dough, whole-grain bread, together with a faint toffee whiff to it, and a profound earthiness, exhibiting the taste foundation in this. Turns a tad more toffeeish, heading into a sweeter direction, together with bakers chocolate and a note of molasses, balanced by the bubbly carbonation, opening up the palate for the hops. Hops become the most apparent during the beers finish, revealing pungent floral, as well as herbal qualities, evoking a short juicy peak, as they blend in the still very profound malts, while producing a long lasting, hop focussed dryness.

Extremely well put together, benefiting from its perfect balance throughout, handling the taste defining hop dryness outstandingly well, due to its rustic malt coating. While this is still easily recognizable as an Alt, it almost reverses roles, especially during the beers finish, in which malts have to balance an usual powerful hop onslaught, which I have never experienced within this style before.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1407,"2015-03-21",3.7,"From the cask at the source. Pours a pretty, clear amber with a light tan head. The smell is roasted malt, fruit, herbs. The taste is toasted malt, herbal, licorice ending dry and roasty. The body is light+, a bit oily with nice give carbonation.","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"
1407,"2012-05-29",4.0,"Dieses Spezialalt hat eine schöne röstmalzig braunrote Farbe und eine gut haltende Schaumkrone. Der Geschmack ist ziemlich hopfig, gut zu dem Röstmalz und dem leicht herben Beigeschmack. Im Nachgeschmack und auch im Abgang wird es dann hopfig. Sehr erfrischend sehr lecker, sehr gut. Fazit: Top

1407,"2007-12-13",4.4,"Das Stike beginnt cremig malzig, erkennbar ist ein milder Hintergrund. Bei konstant malzigem Ton wird das Bier würziger, der Hopfen ist ebenfalls klar erkennbar, unterliegt aber noch dem Malz. Im Nachgeschmack wird der Hopfen (äußerst frisch wirkend) stärker und übertont das Malz. Trotz der knackigen Bitterkeit bleibt das Bier süffig und harmonisch, dafür sorgt der würzig-malzige Ton, der mitlerweie in den Hintergrund gerückt ist. Mehr davon!!","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"
1407,"2005-11-11",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2013 On draught at the Schlüssel: Clear and dark amber coloured with a mid-sized off-white head; mainly hoppy nose with shy traces of fruit and malts; strong hoppy-bitter flavour; dry finish with a lingering aromatic hoppiness, well hidden alcohol. Very good, but not so complex as its ""neighbours"" Sticke and Latzen. Worth a detour, but not worth a journey.............","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
1407,"2005-11-09",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2006 (from the wooden cask at the brewpub) Clear and dark amber colour with a thick foamy off-white head. Shy malty and herbal hoppy aroma with a dense fruity (pear) note. Bitter flavour, medium bodied, quite low carbonated. Light sweet malty taste with a touch of caramel and a minimal fruity note in the background. The initial taste turns rapidly into a very herbal hoppy and bitter finish. Not a particularly rounded brew, but surely quaffable. I prefer Ueriges´ Sticke or Schumachers´ Latzenbier. Schlüssel Stike (without c) is only available on the tap twice a year. But they have no fixed date like Uerige, Schumacher or Füchschen Weihnachtsbier. In the last couple of years Stike days were held on the first or second Wednesday in March and November. The word sti[c]ke means being secret and has a Yiddish/Hebrew origin as far as I know.  Update: The Stike days in 2006 are held on the last Wednesdays in March (29th) and October (25th).","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
