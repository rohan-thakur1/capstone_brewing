Medium/heavy aroma of malts, caramel, orange, tropical fruit and hops.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque yellow/golden beer with a slight off-white head

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, orange and tropical fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops.

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. This is especially true for its abv. Great fruity flavour with a lovely aroma. Great appearance and palate as well. Misses a bit of intensity however.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Seems like I was always missing it by a week or a few days. But I¬ím confident it¬ís as good as it always was.Tough to rate these sacred cows. What more could I possibly say here for its 1,482nd rating? I generally shy away from rating the big boys like this (haven¬ít really wanted to log a rate for Westy 12, for the same reason). But whatever.Of Focal, Crusher and this, that I had on draught at the new brewery, this was the weakest of the three. Not by a huge margin, but a noticeable one.A bit too much garlic and cat/sweat, moreso than in other batches I¬íve had. Probably a pretty standard ""problem"" with beers of its nature, though I do think it still remains highly enjoyable. Lots of sweat, lemon rind, light pineapple and dank spiciness. Good, dry, crackery malts back it and the yeast is clean, providing no alcohol or flaws. Soft melon/watermelon as it warms, emerges, enjoyably so.Fantastically soft texture, with a dry nature overall, but still a malty-soft feel to it with mostly tight carbonation. Bitterness is certainly felt, but never becomes overbearing/fatiguing. Gains various levels of tropical fruit and citrus depending on how fresh it is. I do love the dryness and overall understated hop character. It¬ís always enjoyable seeing people that don¬ít understand it drink it for the first time and complain that they don¬ít think it¬ís very good and don¬ít get what the big deal is; since I¬ím a cynical asshole.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

It¬ís a little pricey. It¬ís hard to get. Which is why I lean to the hype issue. It does totally not live up to the hype that it is the holy grail of IPA¬ís. It is a very good, very drinkable beer. I have enjoyed over 12 of them so I feel I have a pretty good idea. Would I buy it again yes, However, when I went to buy it, I was more excited to see all the other beers that I could get singles of that were available.

Cloudy pale yellow-orange. Very nice head. 

Aroma is earthy, a little musty. Some grapefruit and lemon notes. 

Taste is largely bitter. Some sweetness in the finish. But less than expected.

Body is very full. Probably the best I have had for the style. Mouthfeel is almost frothy. 

Overall, very strong. I would put abrasive or king sue above this though.

Golden-orange pour, hazy, with very little head and no retention. It does give way to a very fine and sticky lacing, but is in no way impressive looking - the focus must be on the taste.
The smell is like a typical west-coast IPA, lots of pine, citrus (grapefruit mostly, and some lime) and tropical fruit aromas, some dankness, maybe some green apples, a bit of honey and a slight funkiness.
Moderately complex and balanced taste. Pine notes up front, citrus (grapefruit and lime again), followed by the sweeter notes of pineapple, papaya, mango. Bitter-sweet aftertaste, and a surprisingly light body. On the down side, it does have a strong herbal bitterness in the end, and the alcohol is a bit too present in the aftertaste, but maybe I had an old can, not sure.

Stuff is like eating a handful of hops with little bitterness.  Pours a little orange color with a gold hue.  Head is white with large bubbles that linger.

286,"2015-07-29",4.8,"Finally managed to get my hands on one of these and it was well worth the wait. Took a few sips from the can before pouring. Lovely dank, hoppy aroma with a slight tropical sweetness. It¬ís an explosion of flavour with piney bitter hops, mango, slight pineapple and slight citrus fruits. A lovely bitter and hoppy aftertaste works so well with the sweet fruitiness. So well balanced and more than lived up to expectations. Not too bitter, not too sweet and one of, if not the best DIPAs I¬íve tried. No idea when this was canned but it tastes very fresh. Outstanding.","SCOTLAND","scottm2588"

The beer sticks and leaves lacing all down the side of the glass. Waves of hop aromas. Unbelievably delicious citrus and floral hops. It has the strongest citrus hop aroma I¬íve ever smelled. Great hop flavor up front that just lasts and lasts. Somewhere in the distance is a slight sweetness to balance it out. There is hardly any bitterness. Slick and easy to drink. A gulpable IPA.

286,"2015-07-22",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2016 [A PRESENT FROM BERLIN BEER WEEK,special thanks to eric]. From the can, i don?t know how looks this beer. Grassy aroma on the first from the can, followeed by piney, citruss hops presence. A little bit of caramel too. Full flavored ipa, a lot of sweet bready malt on the first, little stop fuelled of tropical fruit, like anans, papaya, a little bit of mango. Re start with the citrussy notes, a lot of orange and grapefruit, suggestion of orange flowers. Infinitely final and aftertaste with thw grassy, piney notes. Dank on the palate, medium body and oily mouthfeel. What an umbelieveble beer. Beest DIPA ever. For sure. üòä i?m so glad of this present. Birra che merita la fama che ha. Condivisa con un grande amico che mi ha omaggiato facendomela assaggiare, e direttamente dalla lattina. Non posso sapere che aspetto anbia, ma basandomi su delle foto djrei splendido. Appena aperta, la lattina sprigiona aroma forre di luppolo. Anche cos√¨ si sente pino, seguito da erba, seguito da arancia e pompelmo, ancora in sottofondo caramello. Aroma domplesso e buonissimo. In bocca si presenta ancora pi√π complessa. Attacco dolciastro, un po? di pane subito seguito da un ondata abrasiva di pino e di verde. Potrebbe sembrare qjel tipo di birra abrasiva, ma il pino non copre ogni aspetto, lascia spazio a frutta tropicale dolce, anans e papaya essenzialmente con suggestione di melone acqua e mango. Arriva la componente agrumata, pompelmo e arancia croccante, suggestione di fiori d?arancio che torna al naso, prima di altra dolcezza che √® data da pesca acerba, candita. Rirorna poi una estrema secchezza pee un finale eterno in cui ancora il pimo e gli agrumi si mescolano. Ogni tanro, emergeva sul finale dopo la componente agrumata anche una certa componente di caramello. Un eterno andirivieni dinsapori, per una birra quasi liscia e che chiedeva immediatamente la sorsata successiva. Esperienza onirica e quasi surrwale, mai bevuta una birra del geneee. Un grazie speciale ad una persona speciale che h regalato una perla del genere. 



Nel bicchiere si presenta oro carico, quasi arancio, con poche velature. Limpida ed imperiosa, presenta una schiuma fine e compatta che persiste omogeneamente anche dopo essersi posata. Al naso l¬íinvito √® dei migliori, con una tempesta balsamica e di aghi di pino che invadono il naso. In sottofondo per√≤ si trovano frutta tropicale come anans e papaya,ma anche nocciolo di pesca e leggerissima marmellata agrumi. In bocca la magia non si spegne, ma anzi ti accoglie con una splendida ventata piena di resina ed aghi di pino, prima del dolce e gentile ingresso di frutta dolce, macedonia.evolve velocemente ma con armonia, prima di portare l¬íamaro del nocciolo, del mango, ed ancora tanti aghi di pino.","ITALY","Fashawn"

Piney goodness, slight dankness, distinctly sweet note up front, grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine note, tropical notes. In between the citrus and tropical fruits, there¬ís a distinct sweetness up front that continues into the middle. Not as sweet as Lawson¬ís Sip of Sunshine, but still not overly bitter at all.

286,"2015-04-15",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2016 Can. This was a very nice gift to receive. I poured this into a goblet despite the long rant on the side of the can. By the way, that¬ís one of the dumbest things I¬íve seen on a craft beer package. They worked so hard on the aroma that they want to preserve it to the point of no one else being able to smell it? I can¬ít really smell your beer if it never leaves the can! Then there¬ís the thing about stirring up the sediment. If I drink from the can, repeatedly tilting it to my lips I will stir up the sediment much more than if I pour it into a glass once to decant. Then there¬ís the whole drink fresh command but no date stamp on the can. The whole paragraph makes the author come across as uneducated and arrogant. Too bad I don¬ít get to lambast the beer itself because it¬ís damn good. The aroma is endless. It¬ís a clean, elaborate, powerful bouquet of hop glory. There¬ís a load of melon up front with citrus rind, pineapple, herbs, grapefruit and a dash of forest. The color is pretty light, it doesn¬ít look like they use much specialty malt at all. Doesn¬ít taste like it either, though it gives the impression of having wheat in the grain bill. It has a smooth, yet full palate. The bitterness is strong, but it comes across mostly on the front end and is completely surrounded with huge hop flavor. Layers of juicy hops give way to a dry finish. It¬ís so vibrant and delicious that it goes down way too easily. I get more melon and huge citrus in the flavor with a little dankness creeping through on the back end. I¬ím glad I got to try this. It¬ís a top tier IIPA for sure. It¬ís not overrated, as it completely deserves the ratings that it gets. Overhyped, perhaps. I¬ím not sure I understand driving hundreds of miles to purchase several cases to store and let fade away in the closet when there are a handful of world class IIPAs easier to obtain. Anyway, awesome beer. It was truly a pleasure to consume. 

[January 10, 2016]

Can. I still think this is a phenomenal Double IPA and I still think the text on the can is utter nonsense. The aroma, which I can¬ít enjoy unless I properly decant this into a glass, is wonderful. It¬ís certainly in the top tier of the style. Dank herbs, tropical fruit, citrus, just anything I¬íd want from hops explodes to the point of being easy to smell it from a few feet away. The bitterness is perfect. It¬ís got enough bite to let you know what style it is, but not the super aggressive backend bitterness that others have. Layers of sweet fruit and herbs add flavor, yet the finish is still fairly dry. Wonderful, wonderful beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

One finger of fuzzy off-white head becomes a moderately-sized ring that leaves some spatters of lace. Holy jeebus. This is one of the dankest, grassiest, most resinous noses I¬íve encountered. It¬ís not bright; it¬ís absolutely FUNKY with hops. Behind the blend of liquified weed and grass blades, I get saltine crackers, a touch of burnt sugar and orange cream. The crackers crumble under the weight of the hops, and I love it. The resinous character can be read in the flavor, but a little bit is lost in the translation. The dank funk is still there, but the bitterness behind them is huge. Sugar-dusted orange slices and grass mix with sticky alcohol, a little caramel, and perhaps even some mango. It gets better and better as it warms and as the malt sweetness improves. By the bottom of the glass, it¬ís nearly perfect. Medium in body with nice creaminess. Carbonation is moderately high and pinching, breaking the beer into just a touch of fizz. Velvety. Though the alcohol¬ís a little more noticeable than I¬íd like, the bitterness and malt strike a nice balance. The hype...is well-deserved.

286,"2015-01-16",4.4,"Can got provided by Steve, thank you very much!

Has a completely clouded orange-amber, peachy color with a decent, long staying, froth head.

Smells of grass, mixed with pine and dank, tropical fruits, foremost orange, nectarine and tangerin, due to the resinous maltiness.

Tastes much hoppier than the nose revealed, unleashing an hop onslaught on the palate from the very beginning, masterfully balanced by earthy white-bread malts, which receive a glazed accent, as the hops turn dry, parting from their grassy, slightly tropical initial direction. The fruitiness begins with ripe oranges, peach and tangerine, while more and more citrus peel gets added. While the malts are indeed capable of setting a counterpoint to the hops, they don¬ít got an overly sweet character to them, more like a biscuity earthiness - just the right amount to prevent this brew from being hop water. Finishes with a dry, long lasting grapefruit bitterness, coming along with quite a bit of pine and a distinct maltiness. Drinks overly smooth, while ending with an enjoyable, almost herbaceous, bitter hop bite, developing from the fruitiness, without swallowing all of its sunny components.","GERMANY","aleigator"

286,"2014-12-30",4.0,"The elusive Heady Topper. This is my second time with the brew, although I didn¬ít get a chance to review it the first time, and am glad I waited since I have a better idea of what is out there since that first experience.
The pour is a light tangerine topped with a porous, rocky head that reminds me of the creamy on a Creamsicle. I can smell the hops coming up from the surface, lightly caramel with a tangerine-grapefruit combination on the front side, mild and inviting.
The sensation on my tongue is lightly bitter, but very nicely balanced with the malts...not uncomfortable at all, and with a lasting flavor of resiny grapefruits. The experience on the swallow is not dropping me with amazement, but it¬ís tasty, no doubt. As instructed, I did drink from the can but saved about 60% for my tulip. Either vessel was generally the same gustatory experience, and I enjoyed the brew quite a bit from both equally.

After the 2nd tasting, I am starting to get it. The key is to treat this beer as if it were a maltier brew, and let it warm to 50-55 F. This allows the flavors to really open up, and show what makes this such a great IPA. It is pretty bitter, but with loads of citrus and tropical fruit, and nice balance.

Aroma: It has a big hoppy aroma of grapefruit/tropical hops, pine, and a bit of caramel

Appearance: I drank this one straight from the can as the can instructs you to do

Flavor: The taste has lots of pine and tropical flavors, a little sweet, with a big hop bitterness

Palate: The body is medium-plus, it has a pretty smooth mouthfeel, and a clean, dry finish

Overall Impression: 
I was quite excited that I finally got to try/rate this. Thanks Pinksy! I¬ím very happy to enter this one as my 4k tick! I¬íd like to thank all the inablers who made this possible by sharing beer with me, buying me beer, or just not judging me for how much beer I drink (okay, that last one is really just for my wife).

Peach, pineapple, tangerine, and orange are found as well. There are touches of sweetness that compliment the beer instead of overpowering it. The aftertaste is a long lasting grapefruit flavor. Medium in body, a slick, slightly sticky texture, and lots of lively carbonation. Despite everything this is offering, I find this very easy to drink.

286,"2014-09-06",4.9,"Got a 4-pack in a trade. Shared two with friends, drank two: one from a glass, one from the can. Can seemed to be more pungent, like it funneled the citrusy hop goodness into my mouth. Aroma is pure citrus grapefruit hops. Taste follows and expands. There¬ís malt here, but its just enough to balance out those hard hitting hops. Still this isn¬ít a bitter hop-bomb. Like Pliny (which I was fortunate enough to have side-by-side with this), this is incredibly well done, balanced, and drinkable, especially for 8%. I couldn¬ít decide if I liked Pliny or this more; they¬íre both perfect DIPAs and perfect beers to me. I know Heady is supposed to be hazy since that¬ís just the nature of their approach to brewing, but I deducted a point for appearance because Pliny easily outdoes it and looks absolutely marvelous in a glass.

286,"2014-08-26",4.7,"The pour (screw you can, I do what I want!) is hazy mango-orange body with a pillow of a tan head that sticks around as long as the beer lasts. Aroma is tropical fruits, orange, some yeast a little alcohol. Flavor is the same only a little bit better and with the addition of bitterness. Tropical fruit continues and is joined by pine. Sweet backing to round things out. Mouthfeel: Perfect. It¬ís thick and sticky without being too heavy. Just a hint of alcohol warmth and flavor toward the end of a sip. Carbonation feels very fine and refreshing. Totally agree with the hype, this is the best beer I¬íve ever had. BUT: quite a few brewers are catching up! I¬íve had a couple by my locals and others that are only a few steps and a few points behind. We¬íll see if this is still the best in 2015, 2016 and beyond. 

My opinion on a few controversies:
Can or glass: Definitely glass. When this was first canned I think haze was seen as a flaw when it came to IPAs, thus the brewer wanting you to drink from the can to not see it. In 2014 though all the best IPAs are hazy, so ain¬ít a problem.
Draft or can: Pretty much indistinguishable. On tap it¬ís served at the right temperature, but you can get the same effect by leaving it out of the fridge for a couple minutes before cracking it open.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"

AROMA of tangerine, peach, tropical fruit (passionfruit, mango), spicy hops, light pine, and some bready malts. FLAVOR of prickly hops with notes of pine, sweet grapefruit, honeysuckle, all with a nice balancing sweet honey maltiness. Somewhat light bodied for the 8% and not very bitter despite the 120 IBU¬ís (nice balanced with the solid malt backbone).

286,"2014-08-19",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2016 One of the great hypes in modern American craft beer culture, hard to get because demand highly exceeds supply, but I managed to find a fresh can at a reasonable price and though I did taste this beer before, I am looking forward to rating it in a more contemplative manner.  Pours a warm, deep peach blonde colour, equally cloudy, under a creamy, dense, egg-white head with good retention.  Wonderful, lush and overwhelming IPA aroma of pink grapefruit flesh, (strong) pine resin, spruce needles, tangelo, orange juice, exotic flowers, mango, papaja, rose petals, vanilla, suze liqueur, freshly baked biscuit, nettle cheese, buttermilk (or in fact diacetyl, proving this can is indeed super fresh), wormwood, bitter honey and black olives; every whiff reveals new aromas, this is a bouquet I can sniff all day.  Crisp onset of exotic fruits, sour berries or even a refined lime acid touch, and a ton of citrus ¬ífra√Æcheur¬í, hugely quenching, with a soft but adequate carbonation and a lovely, rounded, bready malt sweetness underneath with yeasty accents playing along; the saltiness, which can become a bit bothersome to me in some American IPAs and DIPAs, remains firmly in place, restrained by the bitterness, as it ought to be .  The piney, citrussy, floral and strongly spicy hoppiness increases gradually towards the end, ""wave after wave"" as the text on the can says, exploding in the finish, with a mouth- and throat-coating ¬íoiliness¬í, resiny and infinitely long, assertive but still in perfect balance with the full and satisfying malt body.  This is packed with flavour to the last drop...  My last impression after swallowing is... well, a juicy hoppiness and maltiness which litterally makes my mouth water.  I do believe this belongs in the upper class of American DIPAs; whether it is worth the hype or not is up to the consumer to decide, I do think there are quite some comparable and more accessible examples around and I also recommend tasting this as fresh as possible (I also had a somewhat older can which had lost a whole lot of its flair), but this is clearly a masterpiece in its (New England sub-)style and a big treat to hopheads like me.

Drinks strong and smooth with a mellow maltiness laying under the powerful hops. A mildly bitter finish lingers for a moment but is rounded out well.

286,"2014-06-20",4.2,"Nice to have finally found the notes on this. 
I had two cans. One was poured into a snifter and the other was drank out of the can.
The appearance in the snifter was a hazy burnt orange color with a ton of floaties surrounding the body. The head was about a finger¬ís worth of white foaminess. There was some light lacing sticking nicely to the sides of the glass. 
The smell out of the can and glass was basically the same as it was pure citrus to piney hops that ended up assaulting my nose in a nice bitter/dank sort of way.
The taste between the can and the glass was the same as it was pure bittersweetness from the hops. Even as this one warms, the sweetness comes from the hops and not the malts. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation was sharp due to the style and was much expected. 
Overall, I can see why so many people like this. If I lived within the brewery¬ís distro I¬ím sure I¬íd be stalking this brew at least on a weekly basis. However, I do have to say this and that¬ís the fact that this isn¬ít exactly the most balanced in the nose. Also, what¬ís with the ""only drinking it from the can?""

286,"2014-06-16",4.7,"Light orange, golden hazy pour. Fluffy white head, various size bubbles. Juicy fruity hop aroma. Grapefruit, peach, mango, passion fruit. Flavor is bright, complex and dense. All kinds of hop character. Mostly peach and papaya, but really a huge host of fruits. Malt is very light and really tries it's best to stay out of the way. Bitter finish shows up suddenly, attacks the sweetness and then subsides. It leaves some tingling on the tongue and gums. A touch of heat from the alcohol shows up and somehow enhances the intensity of the fruit. When I casually sip a pint of this, I end up thinking it's just very good but not exceptional. When you sit down and deconstruct it to rate, you discover just how well everything fits together. It really is exceptional and exemplifies everything the style should ambition to be. The best part is the intensity of flavor that comes on the back of a big malt base and alcohol at 8%, but without becoming the sticky sweet mess that too many other beers that try to pull this off usually become. Pretty glorious stuff.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

286,"2014-05-30",4.0,"Thanks Luke L for the can.  Released for sale only three days prior to consumption. The can instructs to drink directly from it. I had to pour a bit anyway to gauge the color, but after a comparison, I think I like the glass better. Color is very light, like pineapple juice, hazy-to-cloudy, 1cm head, but fades quickly to ring and oily film. Aroma (from tulip glass) is a citrus blend, huge pineapple, ripe orange, lemon, grapefruit, and a smaller bit of fresh pine. Very fruity and sweet like juice. Flavor is: lots of citrus, floral notes, a more acidic (less sweet) orange, bit of grapefruit, and, again, pineapple. Only a touch of neutral sweetness, then lots of pine when more air is inhaled with the sip. Bitterness is smooth, big, getting heavier as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium, sticky, bit of pillowy carbonation of moderate coarseness. Great beer! Not the best IPA I¬íve ever had; hop oils are different than the typical big, bad (and amber colored) IPA¬ís that I love, maybe less farnesene and berry notes, less floral.

Have altered rating accordingly.

Fresh can (2nd April 2014) thanks to De Hop Duvel.

Aroma: the best thing about this beer. Less than a month since canning with hop debris littering the can, the aroma is intense and well balanced between citrus fruits and pine. One that makes you simply go ""Oh. That¬ís awesome.""

Appearance: this is an unfiltered, unfined IPA, and I can only mark it as such. Cloudy, orange. Marked down 1 for lack of professionalism.

Taste: tastes like a fairly flawless homebrew, essentially. All of that amazing aroma is compounded on the palate. No detectable yeast character, despite the proprietary Conan yeast strain. Complex and gradually unfolding hop flavour.

Palate: mouthfeel is sensational - the dry finish combines well with the mouth-coating feel.

Overall: this is an excellent homebrew, on a large scale. Not that that¬ís a bad thing, but it¬ís not the best IPA in the world. That¬ís not to say you shouldn¬ít go out of your way to acquire it - it¬ís still worth it.","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","bakingjames"

It was ice cold at first, which they don¬ít recommend, and I don¬ít either. First whiff from the can was all pine and resin. When it warmed a bit, more grapefruit came out. Taste follows through exactly on the aroma: pine and grapefruit hops, with the sweet notes coming through when it warmed. The bitterness was more pronounced than other IIPAs I¬íve had, but not overpowering. The palate was a bit fizzier than I expected.

A very richly fruity hop with waves of tropical fruit, pine and hop-sap hitting the nostris - as described on the can pretty much. The mouthfeel is fairly light which makes this dangerously sippable. Very ballanced taste too with passionfruit, light citrus and fruity hop. Not drying in the aftertaste which is just perfect. One of the best ipa¬ís I¬íve ever had.","DENMARK","Hoprider"

However, personally speaking, while I appreciate the superior quality of this beer I have had IPAs that I¬íve liked better for whatever reason, like Ruination.

AROMA- Wow. Could I just smell this beer forever? So pungent, and so delightful. Huge citrus (specifically grapefruit and clementine), pine, and floral notes with a hint of sweetness. You¬íre not gonna make a beer that smells better than this. You¬íre just not. So don¬ít even try. 

APP- Drank the majority of this beer from the can, but I wanted to see what it looked like, so I poured a few ounces into a snifter. Looks like grapefruit juice with a bit of orange juice poured into it. Pretty friggin¬í cloudy. A small head, that I¬ím sure would expand had I poured the whole can. Overall, not too impressive. I can see why ""DRINK FROM THE CAN!"" is exclaimed on the label in all caps.

TASTE- Hops on hops on hops. Juicy, fruity sweetness balanced out by the hop bitterness. Hops, citrus, sweetness. In that order. And me likey that order. The bitterness lingers, requiring a solid smacking of the lips. Love that. The taste is not quite as phenomenal as the nose, but quite lovely nonetheless.

PALATE- Not the best mouthfeel I¬íve had in an IPA. Feels just a little bet empty. Maybe a little watery at some points. Doesn¬ít detract too much from the beer, but could be improved. Pretty good amount of carbonation, with a dry finish. Hop oils totally coat the tongue.

O- I think I¬ím understanding the hype. This was a really enjoyable beer. Only room for improvement would be on the appearance and the mouthfeel. But where it really counts, this beer delivers. And I have 7 more in the refrigerator. You lucky dog.","","jbwimer"

Smell: The nose is huge. I got a blast of hops as I poured it from the can into the glass. Huge citrus aroma with resinous pine, floral sweetness, pineapple, a touch of honey and just a bit of bready malt in the background .

Taste: Sweet citrus, pine and grapefruit dominate throughout. The flavors aren¬ít overly complex, but it¬ís incredibly well-balanced. The aftertaste is bitter, but not overly so.

286,"2013-11-23",4.5,"Poured from the can into a tulip glass. This can is from the brewery, fresh in mid-September....

First whiff is hops and then the citrus presence, namely grapefruit, pine and some other hints. So nice on the nose but it doesn¬ít give away anything about what¬ís coming in the tasting....

Poured a hazy rich gold/orange with over 1 finger of off white head. This faded to nice lacing on the glass. Light carbonation noted.

Remembering that this has been sitting in the fridge since mid-September I figured there would be some difference between this and the one I had at the brewery. I wasn¬ít too far off. The hop profile has softened slightly but the first notes are the hops, then the citrus, other fruit hints and pine. The beer is still so balanced there wasn¬ít one flavor that stood out above the others. Certainly the malts haven¬ít taken over and dumbed down the flavor profile, it¬ís just a bit mellower than when fresh.

Medium body for me with a clean, fresh taste and a dry, hop finish. Smooth all the way through. Lower carbonation than what I remember but I don¬ít mind a bit.

Overall this beer lives up to its name. As I compare it to other DIPA, this one is still at the top of my list, even one that¬ís a little older and less-fresh than right out of the brewery. Awesome job Alchemist and hopefully I¬íll come by some more of this down the road.

Can from Freddy at Bev4Less. Thanks Freddy! Open the can and don¬ít pour into a glass, just like the can tells me not to. Aromas are hop rich, surprisingly dank and forward (I thought it would smell less like a west coast offering), with some biscuit malt already apparent. Taste is very, very good. Clean, crisp, ALL of 120 IBUs assault my tongue and roof of my mouth. If you don¬ít love DIPA/IIPA style, with all the crazy bitterness it can bring, this won¬ít do it for you in the same way Pliny, or even a beer like Maine Lunch, will. This is not the crazy malty overhopped rendering of the style, all too common, but a balanced, bitter, bready, sweet craftbrew with balance and intensity in alternate, and proportionate, quantities. Really pleasing. Glad I got to try it. I ended up pouring it into a glass, just because I had to see what it looked like. Definitely murky in appearance, which is apparently how it is supposed to look when fresh. Overall, good yum.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

Review 05FEB12
Thanks Keith!
3/3.5/4/3/3.5 - 3.53
Pours a cloudy apricot with some off-white foam formation. This falls to a broken sheet of the same. (3) Smells of fruits, resin, pineapple. The nose is a little bit raw and harsh, but not bad. (3.5) The flavor is really nice with a sweetness that is collaborative with the bitterness. There are flavors of resin, pine, mango. Decent enough. (4) Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style with moderate carb and a dry finish. A little too dry of a finish. (3). This beer is not nearly as wonderful as it was the first time I tried it, maybe it¬ís the fact that I¬íve had it multiple times, or that I¬ím now immune to it¬ís glory, but it is a far cry from the initial tastes I had. Maybe it¬ís the new brewery, whatever the case is, I will likely not be seeking this out again any time soon. too bad. (3.5)

Dave, you did this. Thanks man.
Can date: not listed, but I know it to be recent.
A: Pours a hazy apricot ale with no domineering head formation, but a night sheet of honey cream foam. Spotty lace.
S: Oh yeah, pine, resin, citrus, pineapple, tropical fruits with a touch of feline urine. Very complex and the underbelly is a sweet malt foundation.
T: Plenty more of what happened in my olfactory: sweetened honey, aggressively bitter with many, many differing fruits on the palate. There are some wood tones as well. This is complex and refreshing.
M: Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb with a semi dry finish.
O: Well, I can see what all the hulla balloo is all about. This beer is hardcore hops and proves its value in my mouth. There have been some discussions about the comparison between pliny and this beer. Simply put, they cannot be compared, they are both outstanding beers with unique and ingenious characteristics which shine to each¬ís own.

Poured on tap at The Alchemist Brewery into an alchemist goblet. Did I mention it was for BREAKFAST (10:30 AM)! *DISCLAIMER: I am not a huge fan of the hop-bomb, so I did not go into this with big expectations. Most of the highly rated IPA/DIPAs I¬íve had have not lived up to my expectations and left me slightly disappointed. This beer did NOT disappoint.

A: Hoppy, citrusy, maybe even skunky (in a good hop way). Very long lasting nose. 
A: Poured a hazy, murky golden color with a ginormous white head. Excellent head retention and lacing.
T: It is one of the hoppiest beers I¬íve ever had, but at the same time, it is not a hop bomb. Don¬ít know how they do it. Most beers this hoppy are a mess. This is perfect. citrusy. velvety.

286,"2013-10-23",4.7,"Cracked a can this evening that is 2months off the line. First burst of aroma is definitely classic grapefruit and pine, with a wet earthy smell emerging as I drink, no yeast/malt on the nose. Bitterness is surprisingly subdued until the end when it merges with a dry finish to give it that oft mentioned drinkability.

Two big surprises: the first is that with all the hops in there, the bitterness is not stronger; most of the hop power is in the aroma and flavor and it almost drinks like a hop elixir. The second big surprise for me is the mouthfeel. This beer has a very round, creamy malt backbone that is not strong but really coats the palate and lets you enjoy the hops for more than just the first second after you sip.

Reminded me a bit of the Denogginizer from Drakes Bay (90ibu) in the balance they maintain with so much hop, but Heady Topper has a superior mouthfeel and finish. The unfiltered quality of this beer may definitely be a factor.

Despite the marketing, I am still rating the appearance: Burnt orange with robust head that dissipates quickly, no lacing. The beer does seem to loose some aromatic intensity when poured into a glass.

(By the way, this is the primary reason why Heady Topper is superior than Pliny the Elder even though both are exquisite.)

Mouthfeel is lightly creamy, slightly tacky with a bit of oiliness at the edges. Finish is slightly sweet, bits of pepper, light astringency and some bitterness. Overall a very nice beer.

286,"2013-10-07",4.6,"Opened the can and the aroma was incredibly inviting. Refreshing floral, citrus, and a trace of resin. First sip hits the palate and it is a medium body, with a creamy, slightly oily texture, average carbonation. The taste is right on the button for an IPA that isn¬ít consumed as a dare (there are many more beers whose bitterness will beat you into submission, this one however is easy to drink without the abuse) Tastes are similar to the aroma, but i assume the yeast provides the interesting but subtle limestone flavor and is absolutely welcome to this party. There is no disappointment here. The finish on this gem can¬ít be mentioned enough... UNBELIEVABLY long finish with wave after wave of citrus hops bombing away at you. Not overly bitter but there is a distinct resiny lingering bitterness which is right on the money. Overall great beer which is 100% true to it¬ís style.","Kentucky, USA","bilhelm"

Aroma is punchy tropical fruits, mango and lychee. Later develops some light pine. A little nelson sauvin character in there as well? Aroma reminds me of Punk IPA. 

Pour is translucent / cloudy vibrant orange with a persistent soft whte head. Maybe some hop haze.

Flavour is lovely squishy tropical fruit with pineapple and peach. Bitterness is very firm but clean. Lingering grapefruit bitterness. Some alcohol warmth comes through. 

Palate is full, but not overly stick or cloying. lively carbonation drives those hop flavours forth.

It's almost comical and whimsical if I had to think of fundamental words to describe it. When you first crack open the can, you get hit with a sledgehammer of aroma; notes of citrus and pine hit you hardest. With every sip, the bitterness provides for a lingering complexity that makes this beer unique.

I found myself laughing at the experience of the entire first can. Not sure how much of it was the reputation that preceded it, but I enjoyed every sip like a fat kid knee deep in chocolate cake.

286,"2013-08-06",4.5,"Appearance (4/5)
We broke away from the can¬ís instructions (The Alchemist wants you to drink straight from the can) and poured Heady into our tulip glasses. Right away you can see that this is a can-conditioned beer. The beer is an apricot/gold color that is very cloudy, with a steady stream of carbonation coming up the sides of the glass. Toward the end, there are some little hop floaties and resin particles floating around. 

Aroma (10/10)
The nose is a fruit bomb; there are big grapefruit, tangerine, passion fruit, mango and lemon zest notes in the aroma with some undertones of big resiny hops. There is a touch of a sort of vegetal dankness mixed in there as well. If you¬íre a fan of IPAs in general, this is the type of aroma that intoxicates and makes the drinker salivate in anticipation.

Taste (19/20)
There can be no doubt that this beer has a big, bold flavor profile, and it is clear why this profile is heralded by hop heads around the country as being one of the best examples of the style produced on the east coast. Up front, there are a lot of those same fruit flavors; it¬ís grapefruit and lemon zest primarily, with tangerine, apricot, pineapple, and mango in the background. This citrus flavor up front gets shifted and dried out in the finish and aftertaste, with a heavy dose of hop bitterness punching the drinker in the face as he or she swallows. That dankness from (I¬ím assuming) the Simcoe hops rounds it out and it¬ís an overall great IPA taste. 

Drinkability (4/5)
Heady has a nice mouthfeel, with steady carbonation and a good medium body that works well for a beer of this caliber and alcohol content. If this beer were available locally, I could see myself drinking it in quantity without too much problem (well, excepting the fact that I¬íd get really drunk).

Intangibles (8/10)
The ¬ìproblem¬î with a beer like Heady Topper, and I¬ím not even sure you can qualify it as a true problem, is that it suffers from inflated expectations because of the hype machine that is the Internet. And I realize the irony in that statement, especially because I¬ím technically adding to it right now. While it is without a doubt one of the best double/Imperial IPAs available on this coast, I can extend to the point of saying that it is the best I¬íve ever had. It¬ís in the conversation, though. If you¬íre able to get your hands on one, and you like hops, you owe it to yourself to do so.

Pours a murky banana yellow with an orange hue and is not as ugly as everyone said.( I think) It has some floaties in it but no matter. Bone white head of foam that fell pretty fast to some decent lace. Pine and earth. Nose is pounding citrus. Pink grapefruit, and pungent with tropical notes. Stone fruits too, mango, apricot and peach. The malt is not heavy on the nose but there is plenty of honey to tempt and tease. It¬ís drippy, and sticky with it and I can¬ít wait to taste it. First sip is powerful grapefruit, enamel stripping hops with a forceful bitter that lays itself in to stay for a while. Pine resin and bitter. All the tropical fruits are flashing in evidence on the nose and on the palate. They all are there. I won¬ít make a list. The malt is thick with honey and balanced so well that you hardly notice it except for the sticky sweetness and the fact that it lends substantial body. A bit of spice to bite you and an almost imperceptible edge that is sharp like crushed aspirin. That edge is just a little sour.

286,"2013-07-22",3.6,"A tasty, if mild, IPA. The body is a hazy lemon meringue color, and the aroma has citrus and grassy hop qualities. The flavor has more of that lemon I saw in the color, but it might have been psychosomatic. I also picked up on other sweet citrus, like tangerine and pineapple, and a bready malt foundation. Most of these hard-to-find IPAs don¬ít live up to the hype the first time I have time, even Pliny the Elder underwhelmed me the first time. But the second sampling is always better, so I look forward to the day I have another Heady Topper. As it is, this isn¬ít quite what I look for in an Imperial IPA.

286,"2013-07-21",5.0,"Pours a golden amber with a two-finger off-white head. No ""floaties"" that many reviewers speak of. Nice lacing. A complex and unique aroma. Redolent of pine, tropical fruit, citrus, and earthiness; the kind of earthiness you experience walking through the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert (for those old enough to remember the Dead). As it warms, there's a wonderfully faint floral aroma. Through all those hops one can still get a whiff of the sweet malt! Incredibly complex. The taste is very juicy, more fruit than pine. Tropical fruit hits the tongue first followed by citrus, mainly grapefruit, and dried apricot. Lots of caramel and biscuity malt flavors balance this hop bomb perfectly. Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, this is my highest rated beer and my favorite beer yet. Truly worth all the hype (and the aggravation to get it)!

286,"2013-07-21",3.3,"Appearance:
Soft cloudy oranges under a bready white head which lingers long and full.

Nose:
A bit thin. Lemon and grapefruit rind held together with pine while hop oils pool in the middle. Table crackers along the edges and underneath. Orange oils.

Palate:
Dry and parching which I found to be a minor deterrent to the veracity of the flavors within. Biggest flavor punch in the middle with lemon and orange oils, hop resins. Table crackers underneath. Pine needles and Christmas trees.

Final Thoughts:
For all the rave reviews and online hoopla regarding this particular IPA, I was expecting a bit more oomph. Was it good? Yes. Was it awesome? No. Nonetheless it is definitely worth a try or two for those who love their hops.

Now, 8 months or so later, I got my hands on a second can (thanks to the same friend), and just cracked it this morning. I finally ventured to pour a small amount into a glass (completely against the very big and bold instructions on the can to ¬ìDRINK FROM THE CAN¬î) But, I just had to see what it looked, felt, and tasted like out of a snifter. I was a little disappointed to say the least. I¬ím glad that it tells you over and over on the can to drink from it, because it was really pale in color, with a light IPA flavor to it. NOTHING like the powerhouse I had remembered¬Ö Thankfully I had just poured 2-3 ounces. 

So, now that I was following instructions and drinking from the can, my second taste of this amazing elixir was just as memorable as the first.

286,"2013-06-06",4.3,"I find that the best IPAs are the ones that impart all the goodness that is IPA while still being smoothly drinkable. And that's what you get here. Cloudy pour (still haven't figured out how that affects flavor in an IPA, but there you go), with strong pine and citrus notes. And the lingering backend is all IPA bitter -- hence the high IBU. But the middle is where this beer shows its beauty. Hoppy flavors of pine, some resin, and some citrus come through on a good, unsweet malt base. This is pure hops, without gimmicks. Seems easy enough but harder to find than you might expect. This beer is thusly recommended!!

286,"2013-06-05",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2013 Can, shared with friend and wife, poured into glass because I¬ím a rule breaker. Big citrus aroma - grapefruit and orange, packs huge citrus punch. Can smells basically like fresh hops. Pours hazy yellow/gold. Taste big citrus deliciousness. Well balanced, with some sweetness to go with the citrus. Even though it packs a hoppy punch the bitterness is surprisingly well-integrated and not even remotely harsh. Medium body, average carbonation, slick texture, long finish. Overall: initial assessment was ""this is damned tasty, but no need to trade my firstborn for it - good double ipas abound out here."" then we followed it with the freshest batch of stone enjoy by 7/4/13, which hit the shelves today, and which was practically a revelation for me regarding fresh, great ipas when I had it last time around. Directly following on the heels of heady topper really drives home that heady topper is in another league. Yeah, different flavor profiles and all, but I didn¬ít expect anything could make stone¬ís offering taste bland and tame by comparison. Actually a good combo for me - wanting to keep open mind, rejecting the hype, then getting a second look that showed me a glimpse of where it¬ís coming from. Damn fine brew.

Lovely hazy-orange with a big white head and some sparkling floaties. Aroma is ridiculous, like smelling a handful of fresh hops - pungently floral and fruity, with notes of pine, peach, orange peel and heady herbs. Flavour is obviously heavy on the hops - OK, that¬ís a bit of an understatement - bit it¬ís not aggressively bitter or astringent like many hop-heavy beers. The hop character is rounder and more complex - there¬ís the expected citrus and pine, some papaya and passionfruit, a bit of orange blossom honey, some zippy spiciness, and a long, palate-coating finish of grapefruit peel and hop resin.

286,"2013-06-02",4.1,"Canned on May 27, 2013.
Appearance: The body is amber colored with murky clarity, some sediment is floating around, nothing can be seen through this only the color is noted. The head is tall and messy with great retention, slowly settling into a messy ring and lots of spotty foam on top.
Aroma: The aroma is complex with notes of pine, peach, apricot, oranges, and mango. Very fruity and hinting at some bitterness.
Taste: Peach greets the tongue immediately into a moderate bitterness of pine with some spicy notes. Mango is woven in towards the mid-taste through the finish as the pine mellows out and orange is left lingering with some spice on the finish. Long after the sip, pine sits on the tongue.
Palate: Medium bodied with sharp carbonation, moderate to high levels.
Overall: This is a fantastic imperial IPA. The bitterness isn¬ít harsh, and the flavors are complex. I wouldn¬ít go out of my way to get this again, but when I travel to Vermont I will be picking a case up.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

The flavor finds a perfect balance of hoppiness - lots of character without overpowering - and a classic, clean lager-like malt, grain, etc. It is mostly bitter but also sweet and spicy in turns. The aftertaste is remarkable, it makes your mouth feel cleaner, like a beer-based breath freshener. What really sets this DIPA apart is not the particular smells/flavors. It is how deeply integrated all those components are to create something that tastes like it was squeezed from a single plant instead of a bunch of ingredients steeped in water.","California, USA","barn0216"

Pours clear golden with only the slightest haze and almost no head. Smell is heavenly, pine and grapefuits loaded. It does smell even more of pine when sniffing from the can, marvelous! Taste is medium bitter with a medium sweetness coming from the supportive malt backbone. Flavors remind again of pine mostly, covering a grapefruity canva.

The one aspect of balance that stands out is the balance between nose and palate.  This beer is magnificently hopped with a perfect balance between wet and dry, with aromatic hints of pine and grapefruit.  As much as I used to taunt my wine loving friends (catcalls of ""Tannic, but fruity, with essence of oak"" were my typical sophomoric jeer...), I grudgingly admire their descriptive nomenclature.  Now, I simply have to convert them to beer.","Vermont, USA","D_No"

Juicy grapefruit with some pine on the nose. Once the beer settles, sweeter fruit breaks through. Grapefruit up front then grass and pine emerge. But, the flavor suddenly falls of a cliff for an abrupt finish. Alcohol and unami get picked up right away and pervade throughout. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style.

Balanced but still interesting, which I think is often a challenge, but the brewer got it right. Finishes with a lingering bitterness, but at the right level.

286,"2012-12-07",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2013 Drinking from the can as I am told. 
Aroma is a pleasant blend of hops - lots of citrus, peach and tropical fruit with pine resin backing it all up. No real malt aroma to speak of. 
Appearance is that of a silver can. Having had this from a glass I can say that it is a yellow gold with a nice white head. It is a very cloudy beer. 
Flavor is a touch sweet with light cracker and biscuit character. The light malt character is the perfect platform to showcase the hop flavors. Hop flavors are sweet orange and grapefruit, tropical fruit and peach. There is a light resin note in the finish. The bitterness is solid, but clean and not astringent at all. Does not strike me as being near 120 IBUs. 
The mouthfeel is smooth but crisp. The beer is fairly dry and not sticky sweet at all. Balanced but assertive bitterness. The alcohol is sufficiently hidden and the beer provides only a moderate warming character. 
Overall this is a very enjoyable DIPA; one of my all time favorites.

Live tasting 16 oz can into Duvel tulip...

Appearance; pours a hazy yellow gold, and a moderate pour yeilds a finger of straw colored head that recedes after a couple minutes... Lacing is good with spiderwebs of head sticking to the sides of the glass. I did get a little carried away during the pour and per the warning on the can, dumped some resin and yeast into my glass so there is some suspended floaties... Will try the next one straight from the can, and no points off for my dumping sediment into the glass... 

Smell; popped the tab and stepped into a tropical rainforest!! I had a feeling this was coming given my experience with Abrasive and the fact that it¬ís canned as well... I¬íll save my ""can revolution"" talk for another time and place but this beer smells phenomenal. Citruses such as orange and grapefruit and tons of tropics, mango, hints of peach, and pineapple.

Taste; absolutely the smell personified here.. Pineapple, orange and grapefruit rinds, mango, peach, tangerine, just the faintest hints of pine, with the perfect amount of hop bite that sneaks in after a couple sips... Notes of caramel, round it out... Exceptionally well balanced.

Mouthfeel; on the fuller side of medium body, slightly sticky with a lingering bitter finish that never becomes overbearing or intrusive carbonation is perfect. 

Overall; DAMN. This is one hell of a beer, and I will be continuously on the lookout for more. Absolutely fantastic DIPA.

Live review, can directy into my mouth...

Appearance; looks great, a slightly polished silver color with screen printed black graphics... No dents, dings or major scratches, information about the brewery on the back along with an advisory pro-recycling statement. 

Smell; great tropical aromas spring out of the mouth hole and continue oozing out of the can, mango, pineapple, tons of other assorted tropical aromas that I can¬ít quite pin down..

Taste; simply outstanding pineapple, citrus, and markedly more resinous notes than I picked up pouring into a glass... A slightly more significant pine characteristic is also evident...

Mouthfeel; identical to the mouthfeel in the glass, absolutely fantastic.

Poured a very hazy golden color with decent head and a grassy hop nose. Strong, spicy hop palate with grapefruit and a touch of pine. Lighter bodied than many double or imperial IPAs.

Split a 500 ml. with two others at the train station before heading heading of to Kwintessens - still nicely cooled. Taste is quite bitter, bitter white grapes, lighter pineapple, kiwi, rather bitter pine raisin in the back, light honey, grapefruit, citrus, tangerine, light alcohol in the finish coming through which is a bit odd. Really dries out the mouth, well-carbonated. I like my DIPA a bit fruitier with a sweeter edge but this is very fine stuff, probably to bitter for me to ever actually drink a lot of this. This is a fine beer. /// Tried again, small sample, more fruity, mellower than I remember, more white grape. No idea of the age of the sample.

A: Pours a dark amber color with a little light brown in the body and some orange hues around the edges. Has a bunch of floaties as well. A nice off-white head forms on the pour and recedes to a nice film ring. Leaves a nice sticky lace down the glass.

S: Grapefruits and resin with a light flower back note. Nice caramel malts and some solid breadiness as well.

T: The taste is more of the same. Nice flowery notes pop up, some candied sugar and some biscuit malt with a little toffee as well. Solid grapefruit with a little citrus pop to round it all out. There is some solid bitterness on the finish with a hint of pine needle.

M: Nicely carbonated with a nice medium to light body. Leaves a nice floral and fruit taste across the palate. Very drinkable.

O: Awesome beer. Tons of flavor and it really lingers in your mouth for a while. Glad I got some more of these guys!

286,"2012-08-02",4.3,"There is no doubt that hype holds true on this one.  However, out of three that were opened in this one sitting, one was heavy sediment that seemed to have the most bitterness, one with almost no floaties that had the biggest tropical fruits character and the least bitter (albeit still massive bitterness). And one right in the middle.  So the look was all over but centered around an orange with light to heavy floaties and a nice white head.  Taste was big orange zest, grapefruit,  tropical mango, tangerines, light sweet malt backing.  Largely and gorgeously bitter.  Smell was a lot of the same.  I would say fuck quality control because no matter the color or makeup the beer was fantastic.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"

286,"2012-07-28",5.0,"Used to stop @ the Alchemist brewpub all the time for this- was there for dinner 7/27/11 the night before tropical storm Irene flooded that establishment.  Was thrilled to learn from my server that a cannery was about to open- turned out to be a great thing as the brewpub was a near total loss (but replaced with the Prohibition Pig BBQ, now the only place you can get this on draft other than samples @ cannery).  The can seals in a near miraculous concentrated hop flavor and aroma.  I did once disobey the instructions and pour this out to reveal a cloudy golden-yellow fluid & nice sticky head that will leave a mark on the glass as it dissipates.  Despite the high IBUs, there is a sweetness and crispness that counters any bitterness- many friends who are not generally fans of IPAs do enjoy this DIPA.  Citrusy, piney, and resinous, it's also extremely drinkable.  Despite increases in production, it still sells out quickly at $12.99/4-pk at the few VT locations where it is regularly available- a solid indication that I'm not the only one who's hooked.  It's now the IPA by which I judge all others.

286,"2012-07-18",5.0,"Pour reveals a cloudy, golden-orange body with sediment topped by a large rocky white head. The 2 finger head displays good retention and dissipates to a thin cap, leaving some nice lacing as it slowly recedes.
The smell is amazing! Big dank resinous hop oil upfront. Bright grapefruit, orange and lemon peel followed by tropical fruit; mostly pineapple and mango. Also has a little bit of sweetness in the nose, similar to honey. Just a touch of bready malt, but not much. It is all about the hops here.
Instant zing of citrus and grapefruit with a hop wallop, but without the crazy bitterness. The hop flavor creeps up on you after swallowing. However, it doesn¬ít have that drink-with-caution bitterness that can overwhelm the palate. It takes all of the tastiness one would love about hops while leaving some of the bite behind. The freshness of the hops is really unparalleled, it is by far the ""juiciest"" DIPA I¬íve been able to track down. The hops are complimented by a sweet bread malt backbone and it is extremely well balanced. Very little booziness in the taste however, just loads of super fresh and pure hoppy goodness.Chewy and full bodied with somewhat low carbonation, but it¬ís spot on. A little oily and sticky on the lips, as expected. This is dangerously drinkable. I could drink this stuff all day it¬ís so damn good and it goes down so easy.One of the few beers that actually exceeds the hype. Are there more insane DIPAs out there? Of course. But this has to be one of the freshest and ""purest"" tasting DIPAs I have ever had. It¬ís near flawless and quite remarkable. The is one of those rare DIPA that will satisfy the hopheads as well as the fans of something more balanced. This is easily one of the best beers I¬íve ever consumed.

Which it succeeds admirably. A joy to drink straight out of the tallboy can.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"
286,"2012-07-13",3.5,"A vigorous pour from the can produces a three-finger thick, pale tan colored head that leaves some lacing on the sides of my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. The beer is a hazy, dirty amber color that shows a chunky, hazy, orange-gold tinged, pale amber hue when held up to the light. Up front is a punchy hop character with notes of lychee, ripe tangelo zest, a dank herbal note, and pine needles all playing a prominent role. The malt here, while certainly playing a subordinate role, still contributes a definite crystal malt character that is biscuit like and notes of toasted whole grain crackers that is fairly noticeable.

Sharply bitter and herbaceaous from the get go, but the finish sees the hops picking up more of the lychee and ripe fruit character. There is a definite peppery note from the hops and this mixes in well with the biting bitterness as well as with the danker herbal notes. There is even some woody hop notes here that accentuate the flavors of pine. The malt character is fairly light, as it should be, but does contribute a chewy bread / cracker note, as well as some touches of toasted pale grain character. The body here has a certain chewiness to it, there is a definite viscosity here, I wouldn¬ít quite say this was quaffable, though it is certainly drinkable. Some noticeable alcohol in the finish adds some spiciness and a touch of heat. There is a light sweetness to this brew that is accentuated by the fruity hop notes; the latter contribute notes of lychee, tangelo zest, kumquat, and Curacao Orange zest.

Definitely a hop lovers beer. This is quite enjoyable, but somehow isn¬ít quite what I prefer in a Double IPA; there is a certain muddiness to the flavor, which likely corresponds to the murkiness that this has visually and somehow the hop character isn¬ít quite as bright as I would prefer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Tropical fruits galore here in the subtle, yet eye-opening aroma, with the acidity of the tropical/mango/passion fruits adding a nice degree of complexity. The fresh fruity hops, oranges, bananas are balanced out very well with a milder grain profile of rice and mixed light cereals. It poured with a light yet thick white bubbly layer of starch white head, a hazy through vibrant medium-heavy appearing, golden-orange body. The palate is probably 6/5 if that were possible. An incredible drinking experience with a deep and powerful palate, yet with a smooth, tart, acidic, and properly bitter balance. The notes in the aroma and flavor go hand in hand, though bolder in the flavor, and more delicately balanced in the aroma. Also, probably a bit more grass and herbal hop qualities, as well as more cotton candy and caramel sweetness in the flavor. This lingers so wonderfully with bitter, tangy mixed tropical fruits.

First sip is good, but always underwhelming for me, but with each sip the flavors develop a bit more to reveal the sultry nature of hops. This is a great beer, one of my favorites.

A: This DIPA appears noticeably hazier than other brews of this ilk. The beer itself is light orange in color, with a 1/4"" head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. 

S: Wow! The aroma is simply amazing. A bouquet of fresh tropical fruits, to include pineapple, mango, grapefruit, guava. No alcohol or malt scents to be found, just as it should be.

T: Wonderfully hop forward and delicious. The taste is fantastic, but not quite as unbelievable as the aroma, which was absolutely world class. The flavor is all about hops, citrus / tropical fruits, and floral notes. Terrific beer.

M: Bitter and dry, in the best possible way. Hop and fruit flavors linger on the palate between drinks.

D: I have wanted to try this beer for a long time. It is absolutely worthy of all the praise it has received. I look forward to drinking some on draft the next time I visit the lovely state of Vermont.

Edit: Drank over a case of this over the summer. Simply phenomenal beer. I¬ím not sure how or where this beer could improve. One of the best beers I have had. Dangerously drinkable and mouth wateringly delicious. My highest recommendation.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Medium white head, disappears quick, ¬†leaves a half open thin white/off white lacing on top of a hazy orange colored beer.
Smell a nice fruity hoppy mix of citrus, abricot, pine, peach, there even seems to be something lambic ish like manure (and light farm/rubber ish-very light) in the far far distance, just a hint and quickly taken over by the delicious hop fruits again. Overall a good crispy hop and hop fruity abricot-peach-citrus smell. A bit like any other (d)ipa, but maybe a bit more subtle and actually the smell just keeps getting nicer and nicer! When you smell this you know something good is going to enter your mouth within seconds. Inhale with every swig!
Lovely and crispy taste of abricot, peach, citrus, grapefruit, hops and a good growing bitterness, fresh mown green grass, light malty touch and the slightest touch of something candy sweetness (disappears quick). A good well balanced hop, bitter, fruity mix that keeps getting better and better. Not too deep or complex, but just so easy at everything!
Aftertaste is getting more dry and has a firm bitterness with a touch of again hop and hop fruits.
Low carbo, creamy soft mouthfeel, full body and a creamy texture.
Another beer worth it¬ís hype, this is so easy drinkable, no alcohol flavors, soft, smooth and fine fruity. Very well balanced. Delicious beer.","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"

286,"2012-06-10",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2014 My new favorite IIPA.  This stuff is truly awe-inspiring and rockets to the top of the charts.  I have had the opportunity to try it several times now, but I have had to go to Vermont to get it, but having an excuse to visit Vermont is a good thing.  Fresh piney aroma, with the just the right touch of yeast and graham cracker.  Rocky head on a butterscotch pour. The brewer recommends sipping from the can, but this man is a  maniac who wants to crawl into the can and become one with the hops - maybe not such a bad idea, actually.  For some reason this stuff does seem to be at its best direct from the can.  HT is packed with rich, grassy, fruity, piney hops - with a nuanced, layered aroma and flavor. At its freshest, which is the best way to enjoy it, you taste cranberry, orange, and strawberry.  There is a nice amount of sweet honey flavor too.  This is about as good as an IIPA can get at this point in our development, or so it seems to me.","USA","Slipstream"

Dances between sweet peach and tropical fruit, sticky pine sap, with a bit of orange marmalade toast.  Pretty full mouth feel, but not in a bad way, tight prickly carb that works well to bring out the present, but not of the top bittering in the finish.  Great balanced hop flavors throughout, that I¬ím sure are only that much more bright and dominate of the malt bill when this is fresh.

The nose is stuffed with fresh hop aromas - tangerine, orange peel, fresh floral bits, plenty of evergreen harshness to balance the heavy citrus. Not really any detectable malts here.

On the tongue... hop abrasion like I¬íve never really experienced. Grapefruit, orange peel, massive flavors. Exceedingly hoppy and bitter. The super dry, bitter afterburn keeps me going for more. What a delicious thing this is.

Updated review; The aroma is like sniffing a bag of hop pellets with a hint of malted grain sweetness. The aroma is full of hops. There is spicy, citrus, grapefruit, pine, and floral hop notes. Tasting there was a clean yet sharp bitterness that stuck around into the finish, it was rather enjoyable. The beverage is balanced well from the sweet malts and bitterness intensity. The subtle dryness was welcomed too. The aroma was very similar to the flavor. Overall a great beverage to acquire.","Steubenville, Ohio, USA","Advocate_Ames"

286,"2012-05-19",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2013 Bottle from Brouwerij Lane Brooklyn.  It?s an ode to hops while not letting them over power the experience.  The only down marks are the haze and yeast floaters on this golden ale with a small head and fantastic lace.  The aroma is deep layers of sweet tropic fruits, pine, resin, funk and hop acids.  Those continue into the flavor where grapefruit and orange comes out with cool and increasingly bitter finish.  But it doesn?t over power the sweet maltiness and stays dangerously drinkable.  It is velvety and lively. I am smitten and glad to have another.  Oops. Hop acid burb.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"

The aroma is nice and vibrant with grapefruit like citrus goodness along with some cracker nuanced dry maltiness and rimmed with mango fruitiness. The taste is a bold pleasing mix of grapefruit and mango like hop flavor running hand in hand with a thicket of resiny hop bitterness. Well underneath the fresh crisp hoppiness are faint murmurs of the malt sweet base. It dwindles away with yummy echoes of citrus hops. So this one gets good ratings and it is crystal clear why.

The taste actually has a nice balance between acidic fruitiness, hop bitterness and base malt goodness. A bit hop spicy and grassy with some minerally notes.

286,"2012-05-02",4.7,"16 oz can. I poured half into a pint glass and drank the other half from the can ala the instructions. Not sure when this was canned, but it comes from the late March release to a few Massachusetts beer shops. 

A - Super hazy dark yellow body. Lets just a bit of light through. Some floating sediment and yeast. Soapy off-white four finger high head forms after a quick pour. Settles down to a dirty cap with plenty of lacing and retention. Leaves behind a slick coating with each sip.

S - Super juicy grapefruit with some peach, mango, and orange. Just a hint of some biscuity and bready malts. Simply perfect.

T - Orange juice. A touch of sour grapefruit and light floral and grass. Not getting much of a malt backbone. Just some faint buttery biscuit notes that work really well with the intense orange and grapefruit notes. Really clean and refreshing with a pleasant but quick bitterness on the finish. Medium moth feel with low carbonation. Alcohol is not noticeable at all. Taste is identical from the can...

O - This is unbelievably easy drinking, I¬ím afraid this four pack isn¬ít going to last very long. Which sucks since the inflated shop price was $18. I don¬ít think its one of the best beers in the world, but it is really high up when it comes to DIPA¬ís.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Appearance- typically drink from a can, but when poured, it is a rich, hazy gold.

Palate- a medium bodied brew with lively carbonation. As said, is quite smooth, but finishes bitter, with the hops back to the forefront.

Aroma has citrus, bright dry hops, and some tropics but it is a bitch to get a nose full through this little opening and swirling the can is going to result in me spilling it somehow.

 I can¬ít do this anymore.... Getting a glass.

 Pour is surprisingly hazy, amber in color, and has a bit of sediment. Nose is so much more punchy in a proper glass really opening up the tropical fruit and grapefruit. Flavor is actually less intense somehow in the glass with the bitterness and resins less concentrated. I left a good bit in the can and going back to compare it there is really a noticeable difference even sipped back to back.

All sorts of hops in this one--big tropical fruity hops, a touch of garlic, pine, and some hot, spicy hops. Just a massive nose, and a lot of sweet malt in the background. Taste is equally as big, but the heat comes through more, along with the grassy, spicy hops. Not as much tropical fruit hoppiness, though there¬ís more citrus rind that comes through. A bit of heat in the long finish, but mostly just big juicy, bitter hops. The malt thickens it up and it¬ís too sweet for my liking on the finish, but I suppose this beer isn¬ít supposed to be an exercise in restraint. It¬ís still tasty, even if the sweetness means I couldn¬ít drink more than one at a time. Which, being a DIPA, I suppose I wouldn¬ít want to. Big, thick and slick in the mouth, this one really fills up the glass.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

Incredibly smooth, oily texture, nice malt backbone and amazing finish leaving the resin and spruce on the tongue for a long long time.  Drank this so fast because it was just delicious.  Probably the best Imperial IPA I have had.  Re-rate 5/5/13 - Just traded for a bunch of this fresh and it¬ís amazing.

Inch thick, very dense, creamy and frothy, pure white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a veil of lacing. Gorgeous beer. Aroma is awesome. Tons of fresh, juicy citruses with plenty of grapefruits, tangerines, and oranges. Lots of tropical fruits with some pineapple showing up with pines and florals galore. Very nice caramel backing offering a nice sweetness that accentuates the freshness and resins from the hops. Flavor is...wow. So many fresh pineapples, grapefruits, tangerines, oranges, and tropical fruits. Very juicy in the middle with pines and florals accompanied by a soft malt backing with a light caramel and pale malt sweetness. Resins come on nicely towards the end as this finishes juicy, moderately bitter, and filled with fruits as this dries nicely and remains soft and balanced. Lengthy aftertaste following an ultra soft, medium-light body and a very gentle, moderate carbonation. Overall, this is definitely worth the hype. Soooo many fresh fruits and plenty of bright pine resins and florals with such a soft and easy drinking palate. Wow, I came a long way for this one and it was worth every mile.

Body hue is on par with west coast hop bombs (light in color). Pretty good retention and solid lace. Aromas are floral, hoppy, resin, pine, grapefruit pith, tangerine, mild candied and tropical fruits, grassy. Smells pretty tasty. Floral, very minimal malt and clean yeast wise. Its all about the hops as it should be. Flavors are citrusy, grassy and floral with light tropical fruit. Medium bitterness with quite a bit of resin character.

Taste is very hopsy with some earthy hops as well at the citrus. Taste is very well balanced, it is hopsy without being overly bitter. Body is light enough to be highly drinkable.

286,"2012-04-15",4.7,"Re-reviewing the Heady Topper from The Alchemist. I know I promised never to drink this one outside of the can again, but I thought a snifter glassed might do Heady Topper some justice. And I was right.
Score (snifter): 97

Canned 01/12/12 and enjoyed 01/21/12 in a snifter glass. This is about as fresh as you can get this in the Midwest. Thank you AdamJackson for hooking me up with this brew this time around!

Appearance: Like my previous pour in a Duvel tulip, Heady Topper is a hazy orange-amber color with a finger of super foamy cream-colored head that sticks around for a bit, settling into a ring around the glass. Slightly below average lacing -- leaves behind an oily layer with no sticky head. 4/5

Smell: Less than 10 days old, this one has even bigger notes of citrus than my first can did. LOTS of intense, fresh tropical fruits -- oranges, grapefruits, pineapple, papaya and mangoes. Fresh grass clippings and dank resin. The nose is absolutely packed with bright, floral hops. I stand by my original sentiment: that this is like sniffing ""a sunshine of citrus."" Even after having Pliny The Elder, Blind Pig, White Rajah, Anit-Hero IPA and Zombie Dust, Heady Topper is still the best smelling heavily hopped beer that I have ever had. Short of Surly Darkness, this is the best smelling beer that I have had to date. I still ""wish I could buy an air-freshener that smelled just like this!"" 5/5

Taste: Zesty lemon rind and tropical fruit with a sharp malty backbone throughout. Huge waves of citrus. In my original review, I felt the taste was mellower and more subdued than the aroma. Having a sampled a fresher can (my original can was just under a month old), I can say that my original sentiment no longer stands. Heady Topper is sharply bitter, loaded with tropical citrus and malty. Oranges, lemons, mangos, pineapple, papaya, and rainbow sherbert throughout. You name your citrus, it¬ís here. The sharp bitterness is more earthy and dank than piney. Finish is a lingering orange citrus hoppiness. 5/5

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation. The Citra hops really explode on the palate like a Citra hop bomb. Finish is dry and bitter with a little stickiness. 4.5/5

Overall: Though this beer is hard to find because it is only sold in a few places in Vermont, it is well worth the effort that it takes to get ahold of this brew. Heady Topper an absolute must try beer. While I have softened my original ""you must drink this out of a can"" stance, I still think it should be enjoyed in a vessel that minimizes the oxidation of volatiles present in the brew and maximizes the concentration of the aroma. In other words, serve this in a snifter and not a tulip glass. Even my friend who hates IPAs enjoyed this one.

Recommendation: This is an absolutely must-seek out imperial IPA. Drink it from the can or a snifter glass.

Out of the can, Heady Topper has a bright orange amber color, slightly hazy, with a soft sea foam froth.

Pale malt, some honey, and a long drawn out bitterness. Pine, grapefruit, and a little spice.

The flavor starts with a little malt sweetness and toasted grains, then moves to a blend of hoppy bitterness - pine, grapefruit, and a bit of herbal spice. The finish is a straight bitterness.

The body is slightly fuller than medium for the style. Grainy character, with some hoppy resin from the middle to the end. Medium carbonation.

Pours very hazy if not a bit chunky orange with a one finger off-white head that retains well and leaves some rings of lacing behind.

Aroma is fresh orange, tangerine and grapefruit citrus, pineapple and peaches, some sniffs tend more toward a dank and piney hop profile.  Overall a citrus and fruity hop bomb.  Malt?  Why bother...  Very good to excellent strength.

Flavor is an onslaught of all the things that make a great IPA.  Tons of orange, tangerine and grapefruit citrus, pineapple, some pine, resinous and a little dank, minimal malt backbone, fantastic strong bitterness on the finish and a bit of alcohol.  Super JUICY!

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and sticky with good carbonation.

An incredible, world-class Double IPA that is more than worthy of all the praise it receives.  Very complex for the style, it¬ís got a little of everything a hophead desires.  While I should be going slow and savoring my only can, this is dangerously drinkable and going down pretty fast.  Fantastic!","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"
286,"2012-02-23",4.7,"Delicious IPA out of a Tall boy can.  Pours straw gold with a moderate head that doesn¬ít persist all too long.  Can says to not pour into glass, and it IS good out of a can, hop resins in it they say.  I pour into a glass all the same, I feel like my snifter can bring the nose out more.

Aroma: It reminds me of simcoe and amarillo, though I don¬ít know if either are present.  Huge notes of grapefruit and pine.  Onion and a skunky aroma follow, in a good way of course.  It¬ís dank and citrusy.

Taste: Citrus to start, mostly grapefruit.  A resiny piney finish.  Every sip is a burst of flavor, and there are layers upon layers of hoppy goodness.  As the glass warmed up it only got more intense.  I like intense, but I think I enjoy it most slightly chilled.  Malt isn¬ít really present, nor is alcohol.

Palate: Smooth.  Very smooth.   Perhaps bottle conditioned?  It has this silky texture that is really unique for this style of beer.  I get this sensation with most canned ales, I just need to get used to it(or its in my head, gubna comes to mind..).  I would almost say I¬íd like a bit more carbonation to give it more bite.  Very pleasant all the same.

Overall:  Get it.  It¬ís worth your money, any day.  This isn¬ít a novelty ipa; I could drink it every day and never stop smiling.","","limeytheelder"

286,"2012-02-01",4.8,"Heady Topper pours a hazy orange color.  Barely any head at all is poured.  Minimal lacing.  While this beer doesn¬ít look that exciting the nose on this beer is.  You want a barrage of hops?  Look no further and I really mean it here.  Full on wall of pine with a mixture of grapefruit, mango, citrus which is hard to explain.  Just straight up hoppy while someone being a tad bit balanced with the smallest amount of grainy malt.

See that picture on the can of the hops exploding out of the guys head as he drinks this beer.  Yeah that¬ís basically how I felt.  Possibly out of every beer I¬íve ever had in my life, this might be the one that they somehow pulled out every bit of juice you can probably get from a hop, I think you get what I mean.  It¬ís just pure hop juice.  But not in a bad bitter way.  Yes it has a bit of bitterness to it, but it¬ís wrangled in.  In the taste more of the grapefruit comes through.  Pine comes in next with the other fruits following.  Just pure lovely hop juice.  But with all this talk of hops, it¬ís hard to believe me that this beer still remains kind of balanced somehow and totally 100% fantastic and drinkable.  Small bit of a malt backbone is present.  Just enough.  A small amount of alcohol is there too.

286,"2012-01-31",4.4,"""Purchased on 1-6-11 from The Alchemist Cannery in Waterbury, VT
Brewed on 1-3-11
Opened on 1-6 just hours after purchasing. Served at 50 degrees. I did pour a bit into a snifter just to get the appearance and aroma but not much.
A - Light golden color. I¬íd think it was a Budweiser just by the look of things. The pour was more heavy and syrupy than a bud though. No head was produced but this was a very easy and small pour just to get a glance at appearances.
S - Phenomenally sweet scent arose from the snifter before I even got into the glass with my nose. Smells exactly as a Double IPA should smell. I¬ím getting a hint of glue and mollasses in the smell.
T - It¬ís clearly a double IPA but it¬ís also clear this is like no other IPA I¬íve ever had. The taste difference between snifter and can is terrific and beautiful. Sweeter than most DIPAs and not very bitter at all. These guys produced a very tasty beer!!!
M - Very heavy body on the tongue and on my cheeks. A slight tingle as I swallow and super syrupy after taste almost like apple or cherry cough syrup. The mouth feel is solid and very well balanced with the taste.
O - $12 for 4 is a great price but I¬ím sure that price will start getting higher very soon. It¬ís a great beer. Worth of 100 on Beer Advocate? I don¬ít think so. I¬ím not HUGE on IPAs and this may be the best IPA I¬íve ever had but World Class? Meh.

The aroma is beautiful, absolutely wonderful. No alcohol or heat, minimal malt sweetness, complex mixture of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, with citrus layers of lime and orange. It smells wonderful.

Beer is light in body and quite carbonated in the mouth. Interesting, probably due to the carbonation, the first thing I notice in this beer is the hop profile. A floral and fruity explosion of hop flavors, again tropical fruits and some citrus that gives way in the late palate to some moderate bitterness.

Pours a very hazy golden color with a lot of floaties, the head is medium sized, well retained, and leaves a little bit of lace on the glass. 

The aroma is a good balance of fruity and pleasantly oniony hops. The beer is very pungent, very bright, and is loaded with fresh hop character. Somehow a little bit of crackery malt peeks through the big hop burst. 

The beer is indeed bitter but not overbearingly so, the beer has a nice multi-layered snappy hoppiness, a little onion, a good dose of juicy grapefruit, a zippy spiciness. The beer is very well balanced even though it¬ís so hop heavy, and the alcohol is basically unnoticeable.

A mysterious can from a unknown brewery with an eyecatching label sat in the fridge for only about a week before I couldn¬ít take it any more. Cracking it open I had one of the best canned beers in a long time. I can only imagine how much better it is fresh from the source. This one should be high on anybody¬ís list who is in the Vermont region.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze body shimmers with light carbonation. Golden rings curl around the edges like the tint of a warm sunset. Lemongrass, lawn clippings, and pine sol provide immediate evidence that this means business. Resiny holds it together like a pot of glue. 

Flavor / Palate - Sourdough soaked in resin warms the palate almost immediately after the first sip. Refreshing and gentle it eases towards the throat. A great example of the imperial IPA style this is the type of introduction that I wish happened more often with new breweries. Alchemist is definitely a must stop if I ever make it to Vermont.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

286,"2012-01-01",4.6,"For some reason unbeknownst to me, certain random beers manage to generate a huge buzz and become the hot beer of the moment. As of this writing, Heady Topper - a double IPA by the Alchemist Pub & Brewery out of Waterbury, Vermont - is the MUST HAVE beer. Those lucky enough to acquire it say it¬ís the East Coast equivalent of Pliny The Elder, or the best IPA they¬íve ever had, or the best beer they¬íve ever had (or all three). A friend of mine actually made the 3-hour drive to pick up a case and gave me a can or two. Only a few sips in I understood why beer nerds are going crazy for it.

Despite the warning (or plea) ""Drink From The Can!"" I poured a 16oz can into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Orange to dark orange color; extremely cloudy but translucent. Forms a large, yellow, frothy head which retains and laces very well.

Smell: Massive tropical fruit juice aroma with distinct sweetness to the nose. Dank piney resin is also quite prominent.

Taste: The thing about India Pale Ales is that they don¬ít tend to be very complex - just very hoppy and that¬ís about it. But Heady Topper proves you can have genuine complexity even while being a hop monster. As soon as the beer hits the tongue I get intense bitterness - it¬ís slightly dry, but it¬ís impossible to ignore. It¬ís a massive hop bite that wakes your mouth up. It¬ís immediately quenched by a delicious palate of tropical fruit juices. Grapefruit, passion fruit, guava, mango and orange are all individually detectable and make for a very refreshing taste, ironically enough. 

The second half changes on a dime to something much more dank. Intense resin and pine sap emerge to give the palate a whole new type of bitterness. Supposedly the beer is over 120 IBUs and between the sharp tartness of the citrus flavors and the almost burnt rubber-like astringency of the resin I can definitely see that. The aftertaste is slightly sticky - an odd combination of bitter hops and fruit nectar. It never stops being delectable, though.

Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy texture, but otherwise soft and comfortable with noticeable carbonation and a full-bodied palate.

Drinkability: Alchemist Heady Topper is not a difficult beer to drink - it goes down very smooth with a noticeable, but tolerable dry hoppy aftertaste. The 8% ABV is the perfect mass for this beer: heftier than your average IPA, but nothing that only heavyweight drinkers can handle. A great beer to have with a meal or extra sharp cheese, although I think drinking it on its own is much more satisfying so that you can experience and appreciate all the flavor without any distraction.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aroma is a veritable explosion of hops: you get the citrus, the pine, and the flowers all together. Taste is wonderful. Bitterness is present, but it pales in comparison to the aroma. Basically, you get a huge variety of hops and hop flavours. A little bit sweet, but the maltiness is really held in check as compared to other DIPAs. In fact, it would be hard to tell that this is DIPA were it not for the huge amount of flavor. Great aftertaste that lingers and invites additional sips (unlike some hoppy beers that do the very opposite). Body is excellent. Drinkable, sippable, and delicious. Yes. Amongst the best hoppy beers I¬íve ever had.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

Flavor is heavy hops, moderate bitterness, sweetened fruity esters, supporting malt backbone, and a dry finish.  Medium body, warmth, and carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
286,"2011-12-17",3.9,"16oz. can, purchased from the new brewery/cannery.  WARNING: Pour with caution!  I did not, the first go-around, and my word, what a chunky beer experience it was.  Downright unnerving, it was.  I haven¬ít seen that much sediment and suspended stuff since my last bottle of Abbaye des Rocs.  My advice is to pour slowly and plan on leaving the last half-ounce or so in the can.  
Aroma is fruity, lightly sweet, then HOPS HOPS HOPS, with massive amounts of citrus, resin, florals, pine, a lighter green vegetative note (scallion?), and some lightly toasted caramel malts in the background.  The nose just has more hops than almost anything I¬íve encountered before.  Hazy light-medium amber color, head is off-white, foamy and lasting.  Flavor profile is skewed towards the hoppy side to an insane degree, this is just rife with sweet citrus, tropical fruit, pine, spice and huge bitterness, fresh and not overly drying or astringent in any way; the sweet, toasty malty backbone is blended in rather nicely and smoothly, particularly about midpoint, since the finish is all about the hops once again, just lip-smackingly resinous.  Palate is active, oily and gently effervescent, body is medium-full.  Shockingly easy to drink and hugely flavorful, this is a hophead¬ís dream.  
Side note, something I find amusing: The label attempts to convince you in various ways to drink from the can, but then on the label art, the guy is drinking from a glass.  I did decant this, by the way, I just don¬ít drink good beer out of a can.  Not my style.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Aroma is clean pine, hop bitterness, floral hops, citrus but it¬ís integrated with the malt backbone more than a stand alone element, perhaps some tropical fruit notes, and a very dry and tight malt backbone.  The aroma is a bit more intense from the can than the glass.  Taste is balanced hop bitternes, pine, and a slight bit of malt sweetness and alcohol toward the finish.  Very clean feel in the mouth.  I particularly like that the beer comes in at 8% which allows the hops to shine more, the malt to play a background role, and make the beer all around more drinkable than if it were a higher ABV.  Solid, extremely drinkable IIPA that is worth seeking out.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"

Overall:  I love this beer.  I tried drinking it from the can, as The Alchemist suggests, but it¬ís just not good for business.

286,"2011-12-04",4.2,"Fresh can provided by jedwards - best bonus ever. Enjoyed in my Hill Farmstead stem glass. The pour yields a very hop hazy amber with half a finger of white head, dissipating rather fast. The aroma is intensely piney, and very simcoe forward. Also oranges, passion fruit, rather resinous. Notes of green apples a very fresh and zesty citrus component. A very crisp malt profile with crispy bread crust and a hint of caramel and honey. Lovely! The taste also plays on the piney and resinous side of the hop spectrum, but also has a very fresh passion fruit and unripe pineapple fruitiness up front. The bitterness is insisting and almost stinging, but is backed up by some sweetness on the malty side - bread crust and caramel. The malts seem to provide just the right balance to allow the hops to still play the big part. As you drink it, the hops just open up with new fruity impression by every sip - first you get all kinds of citrus fruits - the other sip it¬ís pineapple, passion fruit and oranges - the next sip it¬ís intensely piney and resinous. Outstanding! The palate ends with a lovely and very unique citrus tart-ish bitterness that I haven¬ít picked up in any DIPA before.

286,"2011-12-01",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2011 Super fresh 16 oz. can.  Poured into my glass, it yields a cloudy, stratified, dusky burnt amber to light sienna body with a beautifully thick, spongy head of lasting cream colored froth.  Hard, dense, patchy swaths of lacing coat the glass from top to bottom.  Good looking brew here.  The nose is dank, dank, DANK.  Simcoe was clearly used generously.  I get notes of cannabis, wet grass, and hay, with a secondary wave of pithy, peppery white grapefruit and maybe some distant pine resin.  Though it is clearly a hop bomb, there is a really nice underlying honeyed, bready malt character that lends a chewy balance to the aroma.  It somehow manages to avoid the savory, meaty notes and cat pee essence that some Simcoe-based IPAs inherently contain (*cough*cough* GUBNA *cough*cough).  The taste is very hop-centric, showing more resin than before, cannabis kind of fading away.  I get more bitter citrus pith and grass, followed by notes of oily, fruity citrus peel and sticky pine resin.  The malt character is pretty much the perfect counterpoint, formidable enough to slightly damper the onslaught of hop bitterness, yet not so overbearing as to take over or lend excessive sweetness.  In fact, the malts are downright tasty in their own right, touching on baking bread and honey-kissed toast.  Yummy, yummy brew.  The palate is medium-full in stature, super-smooth up front, with what seems like the perfect amount of soft yet persistent carbonation.  Alcoholic warmth is almost nil, which is a feat for an 8% brew, yet it does finish excessively sugary and sticky.  Hell, my lips were nearly glued together after drinking this can!  On the whole, you can color me impressed.  I generally hate Simcoe hops, and the hype train really had my guard up, but this brew is different.  They somehow captured that sweet spot between malt and hop that so few IIPAs do, and it shows off the very best characteristics of Simcoe without any of the typical off scents or flavors.

Pours a hazy golden orange with tangerine hues and a 1.5 finger white foam head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. 

Dank, uber-fresh hop aroma with lots of resinous hop oils and grassy pine along with a ton of citrus and tropical fruit character. Spicy with hints of pine needle, orange peel, grapefruit, mango and pineapple as well as a subtle biscuity malt presence. 

Chewy fully body with a blast on dry, oily hops that linger over the sweeter fruit notes and subtle malt backbone into a nice dry finish. The hop profile is pretty complex with dry, earthy pine needle flavor countered by sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hints of papaya, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange peel give this beer some nice sweetness and great balance without overpowering the bitterness. In fact, these two flavors continuously bounce off of each other back and forth throughout. In addition, there is a faint malt presence which gives the beer a good backbone, again without taking anything away from the hops. Toward the finish there is slight boozy heat but overall the ABV is very well masked and this beer is dangerously quaffable.

Taste: Citrusy hops with a big blast of bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit rind. The malt backbone isn¬ít anything unique, but it is a solid pale malt flavor. Holy crap though, this grapefruit is just blowing my top off.
Palate: Medium body and carbonation, and it really coats the mouth. There is a slight boozy feeling on the tongue, but it isn¬ít present in the taste.
Overall: I like this beer. I¬íll probably have to buy some more. It¬ís hugely hoppy, a little funky, and definitely powerful. I can understand the hype.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

286,"2011-11-07",4.1,"Thanks to Deuane for giving me one of his cans so I can finally taste the heady. Can poured into a standard pint.
A - Pours slightly hazed amber orange with a small half finger tall white head leaving small wisps of lace down the glass. It does have a little sediment floating around in there.
S - Smells of pungent grassy hops, rich tropical fruits; mostly mango and grapefruit; and some lightly toasted caramel malt. Still quite floral.
T - The taste is fairly similar to the nose. It starts off with a big dose of grassy hops quickly giving way to a mix of tropical fruits and sweet caramel malts. Fairly tropical flavor that is very easy to drink. The finish is a mix of light dryness and hop bitterness, lingering on the pallet for a short period of time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderately low carbonation. Smooth, hoopy, feel with plenty of hop bitterness lingering through the finish.
O - Very nice IPA. I had no problem finishing my glass and I was left wanting more. The balance of juicy fruit and grassy hops to the slightly sweet malt is very nice. I hope to try this one on-tap some day soon.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

286,"2011-10-27",4.1,"16 oz can courtesy of Kan. Thanks, buddy! Taken home and enjoyed on a nice Thursday evening. Pours a golwing dulled golden orange hue, a healthy haze throughout with a decent sized frothy whitish head that dies to a decent layer, laces ok. Aromas are a vibrant in-your-face hopping of lemon and grapefruit bombarding the senses. Florals, grass, oranges, tropical fruit. A melange moving into some touches of pale malts, but this ends abruptly, with an assault of hops on the nose. Grapefruit bomb, essentially, with a lot of supporting flavors. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied offering a powerful hop feel up front. Lots of grapefruit and lemon meet florals and grass, a strong bitterness rolls into a middle that gets a bit sweeter. Touches of gumball, tropical fruit, and some cotton candy. Pale malts, moving back into fruit. Finish is a moderate bitterness, preaching some good citrus and florals, earthy hops. Overall aroma is knock you down, finish is solid, middle shows a bit of sweetness. If this could dry up more overall, it would be a world beater. Farther in, as the palate adjusts to that sweetness, it does really move towards the front of the pack, remaining a grapefruit bomb with lots of hop flavor. Could use a touch more bitterness for me, but it¬ís very well done, perhaps a touch sweet, but the insane amount of hops and flavor from them really sets the pace.

Velvety texture in the mouthfeel up front, followed by a highly attenuated, thinner finish, allowing the hop zest, spice and citrus acidity to shine without too much malt interfering. The flavour brings out more of the tropical citrus aromatic qualities, along with some light maltiness that is not overly sweet, which tends to be a problem with many double IPA¬ís out there. Bitter, resinous finish gives you the desired hop hop assault without astringency. The finish is not terribly long, but it is tasty and drying, making this a highly poundable brewski. Could possibly use more carbonation, but if you take the suggestion written on the top of the can, which is to ""DRINK FROM THE CAN!"", then it¬ís possible that it may not have needed more carbonation given that method of serving.

The pour is a nice hazy amber with a foamy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Sure, not the prettiest brew but good enough that the Brewers shouldn¬ít be ashamed of it leaving the can.

The smell is awesome when you pour it out, better than sniffing it form the can. It has a great deal of tropical mango and cane sugar. Very resiny. Kind of one-dimensional but in a way that I love.

The flavor is really nice. It has a mellow front end with sugar and melon being the main flavors. There is a bit of pale graininess in the beginning that is that sweet biscuity type which is awesome. The finish is bitter with some nice pine. It is pretty balanced with sweetness all the way through and a nice bitterness at the end. It prob could have had a pinch more bitterness to make it absolutely perfect.

Glad I got to try this, I am often let down by hype, but this one is delicious and worth tracking down.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

If there¬ís any malt in here I can¬ít find it, but I really don¬ít miss it because I could smell this all night. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Resinous dank pine hops barely let any malt come through, but some do find their way in. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel.

286,"2011-09-11",4.5,"Enjoyed at Mug¬ís Ale House after sneaking in a car after receiving in a trade (thanks mltobin).

This is one of the few beers to live up to the almost insane hype around it. The appearance in pretty much exactly what you would exepect from a good DIPA, hazy orange with an off white head. Despite the cans suggestion to drink out of it, I went ahead and poured it into a pint glass to get a good idea of the smell and it is a fantastic piney resin with citrus notes. The first sip just blew me away. As the can says it¬ís not the most bitter, but man it has the most flavor. Sweet malt base, with not overly bitter hops. Perfectly balanced. I can only knock the mouthfeel. It leaves a less than pleasant coating in the mouth.

286,"2011-08-09",4.3,"Drank on tap (12 oz) at the brewpub, on August first, 2011. Honey blonde a little hazy, medium head. Juicy citrus hop aroma and slightly acidic, some herbal notes. Extreme nuclear hop flavor (not a hop by the way), many herbs sweet, good bitterness. This is a f***ing great IIPA!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
286,"2011-04-14",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2012 Damn, this is hoppy. That¬ís about my first impression immediately upon popping the cap off of this. With that, I should say huge, huge thanks to rpstevens and kingcrowing for sending me bottles of this, the latter of which was a complete surprise. One bottle to be consumed tonight, the other to be shared with friends this weekend.

This bottle is shared with Amyliz4 and poured into two of our larger, unbranded tulips. The pour yields a slightly-hazed bright peach body with a two-finger head. Pretty good retention and plenty of spotty lacing as it makes its way down to a bit of rocky foam sitting atop the brew. A fairly-thick collar remains on the brew throughout as more spots settle on the sides of the glass.

As previously stated, the aroma on this is damn near epic and remains amazing throughout. The initial whiff slammed my nostrils with dominant notes of tropical fruit, citrus rind, and a bit of pine. Each swirl kicks up another bit of aroma with some mango skin and passion fruit taking hold at first. Behind that is a flock of citrus and an overload of ripe peaches. Following behind all this when you sniff really hard is a nice finish of some piney resin.

The flavor picks up where the nose left off, though doesn¬ít quite dominate my senses like the nose did. With that said, this is some really, really incredible stuff. I¬íll start off with one of my only complaints, which is that the hop flavor isn¬ít quite as pungent as the aroma is. Still, there is some fairly-radical hop flavor to balance the hop bitterness. Did you hear that many makers of East Coast IPAs? Malt sweetness doesn¬ít provide balance to bitterness in a fantastic double IPA, lovely and luscious fruit flavors do.

Mango, passion fruit, and guava make their way into the mix. The strong, strong bitterness levels really elevate the citrus presence and make me think of some good grapefruit rind. The body on this does an absolutely remarkable job accentuating the hops. There¬ís not an ounce of sweetness, but there¬ís enough body to really pull everything together. The bitterness in the finish is uber-high and leaves my mouth quite dry. There¬ís certainly a solution for that--have some more.

I¬íve been waiting a long, long time to finally try this one. Unlike an unfortunately-large percentage of other beers with so much hype, I have enjoyed this immensely. Huge, huge thanks again to Ryan and Nick for the chance to finally try this. Cheers to both of you.

A-Body is a nearly transparent light amber hue. Bubbles can be seen all over the place. Pours with a perfect two finger or so foamy white head with perfect retention. Lacing left all the way down the glass.

S- Nose is awesome. Perfect. Citrus hops and white grapefruit everywhere. A faint sweet malt backbone can be detected as well. Very rich and citrusy.

T- Complex for an IPA and different hop impressions emerge with each sip. Citrus initially, then a touch of herbal and grassy, then a touch of pine and spicy at the end. The citrus is very bright initially then fades off the grassy and herbal remain contantly in the background. The pine is very mild and much more resiny than bright. A really big hop bitterness lingers on and on-citrus and pine resin with a big spicy hop overlay.

M-Medium to high carbonation and a slightly smooth and oily light to medium weight body.

D- Fantastic DIPA overall-complex and certainly in my top five-its a bit to bitter to take the #1 spot for me. Its certainly a hop bomb. Reminds me of my experience with PtY-although that was almsot 2 yrs ago. I hope the Alchemist keeps releasing this because it is a must try DIPA!

The beer pours a cloudy, tawny orange-amber with a white head.  A very nice sweet citrus and tropical fruit tone dominates the aroma.  It¬ís almost entirely tangerine rind, mangoes and guava.  There¬ís a hint of pine lurking in the background.  However, it¬ís not quite as pungent as the best of the style.  Surprisingly, the taste lacks nearly any assertive bitterness.  There¬ís a bit of grapefruit pith in the finish, but this is one of the least bitter DIPAs that I¬íve ever tasted.  That said, it¬ís also not overly malty or particularly sweet.  It just sorta lacks a strong taste note.  The thin body and utter lack of hop oiliness in the mouthfeel emphasized this problem for me.  It does have a nice hoppy aftertaste.  It was an enjoyable beer to drink, but, ultimately, I found the beer rather disappointing.  The taste fails to deliver on the promise of the smell.  I¬ím happy to have tried it, but I don¬ít really understand the hype.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
286,"2010-12-10",5.0,"Unbelievable aroma of grapefruit, sweet floral citrus. Its like drinking grapefruit juice! The only other beer to make me say that was a fresb hopslam! I cant get my nose out of the glass, its intoxicating! So sweet and juicy, the finish is a wicked pithy bitterness just like if you bit into a grapefruit! The citric aftertaste last forever. For hop addicts like myself, you must seek out this beer! I have no choice...... I have to give this  a 5!","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
286,"2010-12-10",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2012 It smells so pleasant with a nice blend of citrus hop notes. The can sits in front of you and the beautiful scent of marijuanaesque hops wafts to the nose in an awesome way.  It pours cloudy golden with an orange hue. Some of the cans have more prevalent hop sediment than others. Both bottles I tried had generous amounts for sure. The full juicy body goes down so smooth and the hop flavors reflect the aroma perfectly. There is no bite at all, the juicy citrus hops make it right to the cusp better never go over!!!! Perfect. Best IPA ever.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

Citrus and pine.  There was some sweet malt underneath but it does not distract from the hops :)  The beer had a large hop flavor with citrus and pine mixed together.  Mild to moderate sweetness with a hint of malt.  Moderate bitterness on the finish helps give it a stiff backbone and balance.  Semi-dry with a meidum body.

The beer balance is towards the hops.   Generous amount of many types of hops with a resulting hop flavour being 75% citrus-fruits and 25% resinous coniferous.  Very nice.

That was the only bad part though.  Aroma was intense with amarillo and simcoe hops- maybe some summit?  Catpiss, mango, and grapefruit all all pretty dominant, some citrus, orange rind, and light pine resin along with a somewhat sticky sweet malt backbone, but obviously skewed heavily in NW hops.  Flavor is sticky, tangy and resinous, with tons of amarillo and simcoe hops, catty, mango, citrus, some grapefruit puckering bitterness, and a  somewhat tacky bitterness.

Lemony, sherbet like, apricots, perfumy and piney. Flavor is hop juice. This is one of those IIPAs without that extremely malty sweetness, which sometimes makes these style brews syrupy. So if you like assertive hops, this is an IIPA for you. The malts offer just enough back for the hops packed into this brew. It gives it a slightly almond-like background.

Creamy, satiny smooth and lushious orange, with a burly head.  It really was a heady topper!  Hop damn!  Resinous, gooey cascade, piney, patchouli, weed and citrus rounded off the aroma. 
Wicked bitter, but feels almost milky in the gullet (thank you mister cask!).  An all-out hop attack, the malt can¬ít do anything but surrender to this unstoppable force.

The Festivities:Addictive citrus fruit and dank hop resins cooperate marvelously in this well-brewed and almost quaffable hophead¬ís dream. Mildly honeyed malts support the hop panorama.
