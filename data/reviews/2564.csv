Another oddball style description. Whats this Old World Ale the label refers to, anyway? This thing is big, boozy, and dark - Id be inclined to call it an Abt, had I not previously encountered the Traditional Ale style (which is not, as far as I can tell, a BJCP-recognized style - hey, you try searching the BJCP style guide for traditional and see how far you get!). Regardless of what you call this, its fun - big, boozy fun. Its similar to, but I think even better than, Traquair Jacobite (which BJCP uses as an example for Spice, Herb, or Vegetable Beer, I might add), my previous best-ever Traditional.
