610,"2017-05-07",4.0,"(On tap @ CBC 2016 Yellow Session, Copenhagen) Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Nose is extraordinarily dessert-like and unctuous, very tiramisu-like in character. Really rich coffee, a bit of almond, Amaretto notes, dark unsweetened chocolate, caramel drizzle, pretty intense. Flavour is more balanced, not extraordinarily sugary malt. Lots of coffee, coffee liqueur, amaretto, nutty notes, very measured overall, hints of cookie dough. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Hits the tiramisu marks nicely, and the sweetness coming up more on the nose than the tongue enhances drinkability. Good dessert in a glass.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

610,"2016-07-17",4.0,"750ml bottle via fishingnet. Thanks a bunch, Ben. These have been knocking it out of the park. A deep thicker opaque blackish dark chocolate hue is ominous, deep, and midnight tinged. A firmer dark brown head is sizable, frothy and firm with a nice thicker ringer and subtle film sitting atop. Solid lacing, creamy, dark, inviting. Aromas are chocolatey, caramel and silky dark. Creamy, earthy, creme and chocolate mousse. A subtle nuttiness, firmer carmelized and caramel. Rich, deep, dessert driven yet not just straight sweetness. A nice bitter cocoa, coffee, and dark roasty appeal pulls its weight. Initial is caramel, cream and toffee. Tiramisu like coffee, creaminess and caramel. A rich sweetness hits quickly but ends up sticky but silky as we press on. Rich de leche like flavors, coffee and cocoa. A more potent bitter and roasty appeal helps to balance on the backend. A thickness, sticky appeal, but the sweetness, lactose and richer complex dessert profile meld well together. Its firm but not too thick. Vanilla, espresso, richer coffee appeal at times but overall a bit bitter and toasty as we finish with a bit if caramel and sticky sweetness lingering on. Delicious stuff, more coffee and bitter/roast appeal than the other things Ive had from Ben. But not quite on that flow like German Chocolate. A great nose, pretty pour, rich flavors and nice enough flow. Really nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

610,"2016-03-30",4.2,"From notes. Enjoyed this one over at Chriss house on March 26 for a beer and smoked meats get together. 7501 mL bottle cracked open by Chris. Excited for this one. The pour is a lighter black with a darker khaki ring of head that just stays. The aroma is great. There is a ton of chocolate and vanilla. There is a great deal of lactose as well, which Im not too much a can of. The vanilla, cocoa, and even a blast of coffee really do this one right. There is a hint of alcohol on it, but the woodiness and the rum just dont appear. The flavor is excellent as well. Its a little bit all over the place with the sweetness. Vanilla, cocoa, lactose all offer a great presence with a light cinnamon. Its a little messy, but still very good. Just like the nose, there is a missing component of the oak and rum. The mouth feel is excellent. There is a thick chewiness to it with a soft velvety carbonation. Its just beautiful. The chocolate and vanilla that exist on the aftertaste are great. Angry Chair is killing the stout game.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
