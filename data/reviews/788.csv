788,"2015-12-07",3.2,"This was poured into a weizen glass.
The appearance was an off white big foamy three finger head that must have waited for at least a good four minutes before gently dieing. Wow, that took forever (really tests ones patience). Messy semi-thick lacing sticks for a bit and slides at a nice pace into the beer.
The smell has a nice sweet cocoa malt up front with more bready malts sliding in underneath.
The taste was mainly sweet through the combination of the bready and cocoa malt.
On the palate, theres a smooth transition of the breadiness and the cocoa trying to dry out my tongue. Carbonation feels good.
Overall, as a dunkelweizen, well, wheres the banana esters? Hmmm...think I liked it for me, but dont really see this as a dunkelweizen.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
788,"2015-10-03",3.2,"Pours a dark brown from a bottle. Not much of an aroma, tropical fruit flavor notes, with lots of caramel malt. Good beer.","East Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA","Quick3Beers"
788,"2015-05-30",3.1,"Bottle from Epsom Circle Market, Epsom NH. Aroma is strong bready malts with a little bit of yeasty basement smell. Appearance is massive, loudly crackling, 3 finger foamy beige head (actually a little annoying waiting for it to calm down) on top of clear, beautiful amber red, copiously sparkling liquid. Trace lacing. Taste is moderately sweet with minimally bitter finish with hints of smoke/coffee. Palate is medium bodied with frothy and overly carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, many attractive features interspersed with some not so attractive features which brings this back to the pack some.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
788,"2014-12-28",3.4,"Enjoyable because its a style not often produced in the States. Dark fruit aromas and flavor along with wheaty/bready notes. Easy drinking, good Autumn ale.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
788,"2014-01-18",3.3,"My favorite of the beers that they had at the NH Brewfest. Malty with a decent fruitiness... thought that it was unusual that it was darkly colored... good though","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"
788,"2013-12-25",4.3,"Had it on draft. Brown in color with an off white head. Malty toast aroma. Creamy with medium body and caramel taste. Very good beer.","Massachusetts, USA","two7offsuit"
788,"2013-12-17",3.1,"Draft. Roasted malt, mildly bitter, slightly grassy, light fruit (peaches?). Nice take on a dunkelweiss.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","coolpop"

788,"2013-11-06",2.5,"This wheat ale was definitely more ale than wheat. I expected it to have the lightness and smoothness of a wheat, but that was not the case.

788,"2012-11-24",3.3,"Pours a deep copper brown color with a finger of off white foam the settles out quickly.  On the nose its doughy, wheat, roasted malts and a touch of sweet caramel. On the palate it is nice and dark with a lot of roasted toasted malt flavors. Some nice chocolate notes play nicely off the wheaty fruit notes and a nice doughy background.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
788,"2012-11-17",3.7,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. 2012 batch. It pours a handsome looking dark amber to garnet with a tremendous, soapy head that eventually settles in. The aroma is more of roasted dark malts than wheat.  Indeed the wheat is quite subtle. The body is medium.  The taste  is primarily sweet and roasty with the slightest bitterness capping things of at the end.  Less like a wheat and more like a Dunkel.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
788,"2012-10-20",3.4,"Another mayflower success. Six pack killer this week. This beer reminds me of a mix between a heffe and and an octoberfest. Fruity almost like peach in syrup aroma with some dusty attic and caramel malt. Pretty light bodied  for such a malty beer. Maybe reason to try more Dunkels.",", Massachusetts, USA","TheGent"
788,"2012-09-20",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2012 12 ounce bottle from Nikkis Liquors, Providence. Pours a clear dark amber color with a frothy tan head. Good head retention. Aroma of wheat, caramel, nutty notes, raisins and a dusty note. The taste is wheat, chocolate, raisin and a bitter, herbal hop finish. Medium bodied, high carbonation, slight lingering bitterness. Decent.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

788,"2011-12-13",3.7,"interesting take on a dunkelweizen, this adds a little fruity aroma from the hops that give it a little zing that makes it unique. very enjoyable.","Cloneen, IRELAND","beerfest5"

788,"2011-10-18",3.0,"Dark clear brown color with a roast malt aroma. Zesty with a good dose of bitterness. The bitter aftertaste lingers which hindered me from really enjoying this one.","Foxboro, Massachusetts, USA","rjplumer"
788,"2011-10-08",3.2,"12oz bottle in a weizen glass.  Pours transparent brown with a fluffy, off-white head.  Aroma of nutty and light caramel malts, a little wheat, and some floral hops.  Nothing really sticks out, but the malts are strong on the finish.  Average texture.  A decent beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
788,"2011-10-04",3.4,"A: The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a big tan head.

S: The nose has a mild roast note with a nice hint of banana. There is some malt sweetness in the form of bread and toast. There might even be some mild clove along with a hint of chocolate.

T: Minimal banana flavor followed by lots of roast and toasted malt. Sweet bread malt flavors with a mild sweetness of chocolate. There is a little bit of bitterness, especially as the beer sits for a moment.

M: Medium in body with medium carbonation.

O: A pretty enjoyable beer, I thought. Though, I would have preferred more of a traditional dunkelweizen.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
788,"2011-09-23",3.6,"12oz Bottle, poured at RIFT Dunkelweizen calibration tastings. By itself, this isnt a bad beer. Its roasty, toasty, complex and drinkable. As a Dunkelweizen, its a pretty good filtered Brown Porter. Goodness its dark and toasted and theres very little sign of either wheat or german yeast. I understand the choice, its just hard to put it up against other examples of the style. So, I think I wont. Ill leave it as a comforting, brown, toasty fall beer that works really well for what it wants to be.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
788,"2011-09-13",3.7,"Kind of an odd aroma, with roasted malt, nut, and maybe some cheese.  Tastes like liquid carrot cake, with lots of bread, molasses, and spice.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  Really good.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
788,"2011-08-20",3.0,"Pours a reddish black with a 1 finger head that slowly fades to a thin film on the surface of the beer. Smells of roasted malts and molasses. Taste is kinda not what I was expecting to be honest. Ive had roasted malts before but this is REALLY roasted. I taste molasses, dark chocolate and hops. Overall though a good beer.","Fall River, Massachusetts, USA","Tiberious_416"
788,"2011-05-05",3.3,"Bottled.  Poured rich medium garnet with a creamy, sticky beige head.. looked great in the glass!  The aroma picked up sweet bready and molasses notes, with what seemed like a moderate funky infection laced throughout (somewhat sour, with some fruit and some foot present).. in its present state, I wouldnt peg it as a dunkelweizen, but it was intriguing.  The flavor found bread, molasses, and a kiss of chocolate on the mostly dry core.. tart wheat and a touch of medicinal sourness around, and that character complemented well.. more fruity on the finish.  Medium-bodied at most on the palate.. the malts were at odds with the wheat and other sourness at times, but it had a decent flow for the most part.  In the end, I dont know if it was actually infected.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
788,"2010-11-15",2.7,"The malt is too toasted for me, tastes almost burnt, has potential, but the malt is just killing it for me.  I can taste the smoked flavor, I think I am just not a dunkelweizen fan in general so take this with a grain of salt.....if you like that style try this because you may like this, just not my bag","Massachusetts, USA","thicksuds"
788,"2010-10-20",3.2,"12oz bottle thanks to afrantzell.  Pours dark brown with a well-formed and lasting light tan head.  The aroma is rather subtle, with wheat and malt mostly.  Not too much to it.  Flavor is also wheat and malt, slightly burnt.  Not too flavorful but not bad.  Medium-bodied and dry with average carbonation.  Decent beer overall, but nothing crazy good.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
788,"2010-10-05",3.8,"12 oz. bottle pored into a Weizen glass. Nice nose of malt and yeast. Color is dark mahogany. Head was thick and lasted awhile, real good lacing on the glass. Lively carbonation. If you like Dunkelweizen, you should like this one, I did.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
788,"2010-09-23",4.4,"Dark pour into a pint glass. Smells of nuts and brown sugar goodness. Terrific beer from an up and coming brewer!","Massachusetts, USA","Pearsonbeer"
788,"2010-09-03",4.0,"Pours dark mahogany into a Sam glass. Mocha head with medium retention recedes to coat surface. Dark chocolate and mild spice aromas. Dark caramel and licorice upfront turning smoky and chocolatey before the lasting roasty nut and hop finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
788,"2010-08-31",3.7,"A very dark brown wheat ale with a roasty aroma. Flavor is slighty fruity but dominated by roasty malts. Good carbonation and mouthfeel.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
