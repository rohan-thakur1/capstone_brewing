4571,"2014-10-15",3.7,"22oz bottle 10/15/14 (Binnys Downers Grove)-40° in Tumbler Batch #413-Pours a murky yellowish orange with floaties. Aroma of spices, wheat, and coriander. Taste of the same with some citrus. This light bodied brew is well balanced and damn tasty.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Headbanger"
4571,"2014-08-12",3.8,"22oz bottle poured into a long stemmed goblet. The aroma is bright, sweet bananas, lemon, orange, and other tropical fruits. Additionally, theres a plentiful secondary note of dusty, earthy spices (clove, fennel, and even coriander come to mind). The minority note is a light, sugary scone and/or biscuit note. It pours a hazy yellow with a white soapy head. The head retains well, with a decent surface coating throughout, and it leaves behind an above average lace - not quite what I would expect from a Belgian Wit, but not overly disappointing either. The taste is a medium / medium-high sweet with a medium bitter. The texture is more on the thin side with fizzy, tiny-bubble carbonation. The medium body finishes with banana, vanilla, and spice. Theres maybe even a touch of pear in there (or maybe its just some of the tropical fruit trying to poke through). The aftertaste is sweet and spicy apple pie.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Alcohol is pretty well covered, but pretty good.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"

Lightly dry finish. Light spice, very good sort of fruity estery belgian yeast contribution. Light citrus peel, moderate zesty sweet taste, light bitterness. Awesome bigger wit beer.

4571,"2012-12-30",4.0,"Oh what a wit!  Late December back in twenty twelve what a very special wit from the shelve.  What a wit-off what a wit.  Tons of Mango and tropical flavors dominate with nice zest and spicyness of a wit.  Maybe hoegarden should chuck a bunch of mangos in there to make it better?","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

4571,"2012-12-17",4.2,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Local 1675 Tulip

It ours a very cloudy with a hazy orange and  a two finger white head. Big trails of lacing remain on the glass.
Smells like orange and lemon along with lots of spices.
Taste follows nose with citrus being more dominant over the spices. Lemon, oranges, spices.
It has a medium body and high carbonation.
Overall not a typical witbier.... more of a citrus take
These guys keep rolling out great beer after great beer after great beer 
 I got $20 in my pocket! Gonna go get some more!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","BeerMeFitz"
4571,"2012-11-10",3.6,"22 oz bottle.  This beer pours a dirty orange color with almost no head.  Aroma of wit spice, pinapple, mango, coriander and orange peel.  Flavor is very fruity, mild sweetness, light tartness imparted by mango and citrus notes.  Nice, refreshing, and certainly more flavor than the average wit.  The body is medium, slick.  Solid, flavorful wit.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
4571,"2012-11-09",3.5,"Pours a hazy straw yellow.    Notes of citrus a spice.   The citrus gives way to a medium bodied spice that invokes notes of white pepper.  Yeast flavors show a dominance.  Nice flavorful finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","JAF737300"
4571,"2012-10-24",3.8,"22oz bottle.  Pours a hazy milky yellow with a white head.  Nice spicy aroma.  Lots of that lemon corriander with some bubblegum Belgian yeast.  Some earthy and sweet undertones as well.  Fruity bubblegum red fruit and grapefruit flavors.  I really like the yeast esters with a strong bitterness from grapefruit and pine.  The spices seemed too much at first but my palate adjusted since they are not too overbearing halfway through a glass.  Id like less of the spice, but it works.  Tasty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
4571,"2012-10-20",4.0,"22 oz. bottle served in a FFF teku glass. Batch #38.

A: Pours a dirty orange color with fluffy white head forming on the pour. It recedes to a thin film that leaves some sticky sheets of lace down the glass.

S: Definite sweet yeast presence with nice citrus backing. Some toasted grains with a little orange as well.

T: The taste follows the nose. Some sweet yeast, a little chalky, but nice smooth citrus notes as well. Some light peppery notes with a little lemon peel.

M: Medium to light bodied with nice medium high carbonation. The body has a little more weight to it than a normal wit, but its still very drinkable.

O: A very solid wit. Im sold on the addition spices added as it gave the beer a light kick that made the drink a lot more enjoyable.

4571,"2012-10-18",3.8,"Bottle served in Pipeworks snifter: Hazy golden hue with a nice frothy head which left very nice lacework upon the glassware. The aroma has notes of blood orange, mango, lime leaves, coriander, lavender, grains of paradise, wheat husk, pils, touch of caramel and aromatic malts with a touch of bubblegummy Belgian yeast esters. The taste is a combination of acidic fruits, sweet fruits, crisp malts, and the ever present Belgian yeast characteristics. A dash of alcohol and peppery spices clean up the palate except for the lasting juicy fruit twang. The mouth feel is lively enough and has some bite but I prefer my Witbiers to be a bit more refreshing and bright. The mouth feel is slightly heavier than is the norm for the genre. Overall a nice beer but something I much rather drink during the spring and summer months (much like the Berliner Weisse). I will buy again methinks even if the fruity components comes off more like tangerine and blood orange than mangoes on the palate. (I do not mind in the least bit)","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Aromas are gentle citrus and mellow tropical fruit. Flaked wheat, touches of dough, mellow spice, gentle coriander, some earthy spice. Mango is mellow, touches of citrus. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, preaching mellow mango and citrus, lemon, touches of florals, grass. Some dryness, with mellow sweet tropical fruit.

4571,"2012-10-08",3.7,"22oz bottle purchased at a local store, most likely wlv...pours a mostly cloudy and muddled orange brown hue, predominantly non-transparent, and topped with a thin to medium vivid white head that sticks around for a duration... notes of banana and yeasty esthers in the aroma, a touch of dried fruit, slightly spicy with some added firm breadiness. orange and citrus notes without any realdistinguishable mango which was expected and foretold... full creamy bodied consistency throughout in the flavor with the aforementioned aroma profile following through.  sweet upfront but a light but noticeable tangines develops 3/4s of the way through and holds on into the finish.  carbonation adds some tingly liveliness.  a bit bigger than expected but this was pretty nice, despite not being a big fan of the style itself.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

4571,"2012-10-04",4.0,"Very tasty.  Never seen a brew that looks like this: completely opaque haziness - looked like pale orange juice.  Smelled strongly of orange peel and belgian yeast.

4571,"2012-10-03",3.6,"First off why is it telling me not to pour the yeast on the bottle? This is an unfiltered witbier, if you dont want the yeast poured then why even brew the style? Anyways it has a nice milky hazy gold pour with a creamy white head that leaves no lacing.

Smell is mostly clove with some banana and citrus. The mango seems a bit subdued in the smell. I was looking forward to more of it.

The flavor is pleasant. Mild tartness, wheat, clove, banana. The sour mango leaves more of a mark. 

Not my favorite style but nicely done.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
4571,"2012-10-03",3.4,"22oz bottle from Binnys Lincoln Park. Batch #38. Pours a very hazy and cloudy, orange-gold colored body with a finger-width, frothy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is big Belgian yeast with a light citrus-orange peel, a good amount of coriander, a biscuity wheat malt backing, some flowers, and a touch of earth. Flavor is similar. Citrus-orange peels and wheat up front with a biscuity malt backing, a moderate coriander, and flowers. A touch of tart mango towards the end as this finishes wheaty and citrusy with a light flowery spice, a good amount of coriander, and a hint of clean yeast. Lengthy aftertaste following a wheaty, medium body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid Wit. Lots of smooth wheats with a good amount of citrus peel, flowers, coriander, yeast, and a light fruity tartness. Not bad.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Orange peel. The mango isnt really there in the nose. Biscuity wheat malt as well. On tasting, a really nice witbier. Full wheat and citrus, light spicing and clean yeast.
