4404,"2016-12-17",3.4,"A smoky aroma with a hint of yeast. Pours a hazy black color with a short lasting tan head. A watery body with a taste of smoke and grain, a smoked grain finish.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","Luvystypotables"
4404,"2016-12-16",3.6,"On draft at York River Landing, Maine. Smoke and chocolate that finishes lager clean. Very well made.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
4404,"2016-12-05",3.8,"12 ounce bottle from Pearl Street Beverage in Burlington, VT, drunk a few minutes out of the fridge in a Zywiec lager glass. Darkly translucent cola color, thick off-white lasting large-bubbled head which laces finely as it decays...lightly spicy (cinnamon) toasty aroma offers more than a little smokiness, a hint of vanilla...body is a bit sweet at the front, a bit less so in the middle and finish but still perhaps more sugary than most in this style, yet offering plenty of that dark roastiness and a very smooth lager body, with a touch of bitterness to finish and light prickly carbonation; could be a little fuller I suppose but this is small as issues go. All in all an excellent representation to this palate; I wish Id bought more von Trapp stuff on my recent visit back east but you cant have everything.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4404,"2016-11-24",3.9,"On tap at brewery. Pours black with tan head. Smoky roasted malt aroma with chocolate malt. Flavor is dark roasted malt with a caramel malt flavor that comes out as the beer warms. Unsweetened chocolate. Smoky flavor throughout beer. Nice roasted finish. Another fantastic beer from Von Trapp. So good I bought a six pack.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","dlovell2"
4404,"2016-05-25",3.6,"Where and how:  bottle 12 oz

4404,"2016-04-30",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. Dark brown / black with thin white head. Aroma shows coffee, caramel, burnt grain. 
Flavor is spot on for the style. Molasses / caramel base that gives some mild sweetness. Mild nuances of chocolate. The finish has a burnt grain and very light smoky hint. Traces of yeast. The carbonation is moderate with a chalky / smoky grain texture. Easy to drink. This is rather nice.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
4404,"2016-02-17",3.6,"Draft. My bar IDs this as a rauchbier, but the flavor is big roasty walnuts and a bit of roasty cocoa, not smoke. Aroma of faint coffee. Starts with a big burst of roasty mouth feel that disperses quickly. Refreshingly wintry!","","TylerGreenDC"
4404,"2016-01-30",3.6,"Pours deep mahogany into a shaker. Pancake head with medium retention recedes leaving trailing sheets. Dark chocolate and caramel aromas. Dry with chocolate covered caramel upfront turning to mildly smoky roasted nuts and espresso in the medium length finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
4404,"2015-11-24",4.0,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a one and a half foamy off-white to tan head. Light foamy lacing stuck around the sides of the glass nicely.
The smell started with a delicate amount of sweet milk chocolate sliding into a graceful smokiness. Light roasty edges balance it out.
The taste was semi-sweet and roasty initially bringing in the smoke to balance. Light bready/yeastiness flows nicely into the grand scheme of things.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a nice score of level maltiness sliding over my tongue.
Overall, really nice schwarzbier ranging close to the ""rauchbier"" style.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4404,"2015-11-14",3.5,"Bottled from Meditrina. Black with ring head. Smoky caramel aroma and hint of herbs. Sweet burnt caramel coffee chocolate brown sugar maple syrup with ashy woody smoky finish. Medium light body. Could use a hint more carbonation. A lot like Jacks Abby Smoke and Dagger but not as good. I was hoping this wouldd be a Bamberger rauchbier and not a black lager. Anyhow, pretty good, but Ill continue to drink Great Northern Smokin Rauchbier as my regular. And Im especially glad I didnt rate it last night when I poured it into a glass I had not properly cleaned and it sucked. Yes, clean glasses matter.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
4404,"2014-01-06",3.8,"Had a bottle sitting in my fridge for ten months. Time did good things to it! Black color, no head. Big smoke, toasted malts. The sweetness has mellowed out since the the time I had it at the brewery. Taste is: rauch, chocolate, toasted malts, toffee. The smoke wraps around the whole beer nicely, not over powering though. Very solid.","New York, USA","curepute"
4404,"2013-12-28",3.7,"On tap at the brewery: Pours dark brown with a thick tan head. The aroma is roasted, smokey, and a bit of chocolate. Taste is more of the same, but is quite a bit sweeter than most of Trapps offerings. It is still quite enjoyable, though. A little hop bite at the back end but not much. Medium body, slightly sticky on the palate, pretty enjoyable.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
4404,"2013-12-21",3.5,"On draft. Dark brown with a light tan head. Smells sweet. Smoke and dark malt flavors. Nice beer!","Vermont, USA","Onebigtymer11"
4404,"2013-08-07",3.6,"The aroma is roasty, smoky, chocolate. The appearance is deep brown/black, reddish hue, off-white head. The flavor is chocolate, roast, brown sugar. The finish is chocolate, roast, molasses. The flavor and finish are sweeter than the aroma. Medium in body, slightly thick. Pretty nice.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
4404,"2013-04-13",3.2,"On tap at Farmhouse. Pours black. Aroma is primarily fig with some mild raisin notes. Pleasant flavor of fig, coffee, and some chocolate malt. Light body. I didnt get any smokiness. I actually got more dark fruit than anything.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","italarican"
4404,"2013-02-09",3.5,"On tap in the lounge at the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, VT.

Opaque mahogany with small khaki head and good lacing.

Aroma of roasted malt, dark fruit, smoke, toffee and caramel.

4404,"2013-02-04",3.8,"A bit smokier than expected, these roasted malts add up to a true consolation.  A very nice winter beer.","Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA","BierIsland"
4404,"2012-12-26",2.9,"On draft at Resevoir.  The beer that nobody needed just wasnt very good.  really tasted to me like burnt leaves smells.  Just grainy, earthy, leaves, roast, and a little astringent.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
4404,"2012-12-21",3.5,"On draft, very milky and lactosy, no hops at all, ok I guess sweetish, cuties are for kids","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
4404,"2012-07-10",3.6,"I had this on tap at Das Bierhaus in Burlington.

This one was served a bit too cold, but the flavors did well under those conditions. The slight smokiness crept in as the beer warmed. The base beer tasted more like a schwartzbier, but either way a very good creation","Hinesburg, Vermont, USA","josarah"
4404,"2012-05-02",3.2,"Black lager with a roasted, chocolate flavor and a smoky but not overwhelming finish. Great unusual beer.","Vermont, USA","meghanjmason"
4404,"2012-04-18",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub in Stowe, VT. Pours a clear dark brown colored body with some mahogany highlights. Finger-width, dense and creamy, light brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a solid lacing throughout. Aroma is nice with some bready malts, lightly sweetened caramel, a touch of smokiness, a light roast, and some floral fruits. Flavor is similar. A bit smoky up front with some soft bready malts and a light caramel. A bit of a floral fruitiness in the middle with a light roast before this finishes smooth, clean, and nicely dry from the roasts and a light hopping that give this a light bitterness. Lengthy aftertaste following medium-thin body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid schwarzbier. The smokiness is pretty cool and this still has a nice, lightly sweetened bready maltiness that is all balanced with a clean, dry finish. Feels a tad thin at times, but drinks nicely. Good beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
4404,"2011-12-28",3.5,"Trapp Family Lodge: Pours a black color with a beige head. Aroma is all smoky, roasty, and chocolatey. Taste is much on the same level. I liked the smoke flavors, but they were certainly not dominant. Roasted malt and chocolate made definite appearances. Well-balanced throughout. This was easily the best beer I got from the sampler.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
4404,"2011-07-05",3.4,"Draft at Blind Tiger for Vermont event. Dark brune pour with some tan head. Chocolate and roasted malt aroma tones. Dark flavors finish with a bit of sweetness, does have some lager tones in the flavor.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
4404,"2011-03-30",3.5,"In short: A clean dark beer with plenty of roasted cake malts.  Nice session beer.
How: Tap at Flatbread, Burlington VT
The look: Clear mahogany body topped by a persistent small beige head
In long: Nose of fresh black cake.  Taste is toasted cake malts, some black chocolate, some toasted nuts, some raisins and a bit of caramel to tie it all together.  Medium body and creamy mouthfeel to go along with the cake theme.  With the roasted malts being so upfront I would not have been able to tell if it was a stout or a Schwarzbier (not a bad thing, just an observation).  Overall a very enjoyable clean session beer.  This was a well balanced pint.  Which is pretty useless because there are never any earthquakes in Vermont.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4404,"2011-03-25",3.4,"Draft.  Pours a bruin body with an off white head and light retention.  Light lagered tones, malty sweetness and a nice licorice tone.  Dingy coco notes, with a mild coco and roasted finish.  Alright.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
4404,"2011-03-02",3.7,"On tap at the Blind Tiger.  Pours a clear ruby brown to black with a medium sized beige head.  Roast, toast, and chocolate on the nose.

4404,"2011-02-28",3.5,"From tap at American Flatbread. Dark roasted malty and slight breadish aroma. Dark roasted malty and breadish. Lingering dark malty and bitter. Roasted malty finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
4404,"2011-02-28",3.5,"Draught from Blind Tiger. Poured dark etc.  Almost more Portery than schwarzbier - kind of thick.","New York, USA","Maverick34"
4404,"2011-02-25",3.8,"Tap at BT.  Pours a very deep dark woody brown/near pitch black with a thin lasting beige head.  Aroma has a stronger roast than expected for a schwartzbier, more clean stout-like, medium earthy green hops, light chocolate, and nutty caramel hints.  Flavor is less roasty, a bit more nutty and chocolate, mineral, light grass, toasty clean with a light bitter finish.  Pretty good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

Appearance : Deep clear dark amber with a small head. Nice lacing. 

Aroma : Roasted malt with nice raisins and great malt. Light hops. Nice fruits.

Taste : Light caramel with malt and raisins. Great malt. LIght carbonation, very nice mouthfeel. Long finish with a nice bitterness. 

Overall : Very nice brew. Very light and drinkable but with a nice complexity. Nice carbonation level. Very clean. Great notes of caramel and raisins. Very drinkable. Nice stuff.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
4404,"2011-02-04",3.5,"Bottle/Growler 64oz - Growler from Hunger Mountain Coop.  Pours a fairly opaque dark brown in color with almost no head and very little carbonation.  Aroma is just barely sweet and mostly of toasted/roasted malts, a hint of chocolate, hint of coffee and a tad bit of smoke.  Flavor is surprisingly tart to start with plenty of the dark malts, stronger chocolate and a slight bitterness of the hops.  Smooth in the mouth with a decent palate.  The sweetness in the aroma appears again at the end.  Lingering mocha at the end.  Mr. Van Anda did not disappoint me... I like this one.","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"
4404,"2010-12-21",3.3,"On tap at Bluebird Tavern in Burlington. Reddish cola colored pour with a small film of a head. Aroma brings wheat and sourdough breadiness to the forefront. Secondary notes include caramel, molasses, smoke, and rye. The flavor holds increased smoke presence and continued sweetbread and caramel. The mouthfeel is a touch thin, but really pretty tasty overall.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
