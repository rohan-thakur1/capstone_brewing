The Black was too subtle for 10 months in a bourbon barrel, and though the bourbon is not necessarily overwhelming, it covers all the subtleties of the beer and leaves a fairly lifeless beverage akin to one of those 5% ""jack and coke"" type things. Thanks a bunch Steve for the bottle.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1959,"2009-03-30",3.7,"On draft at Capones.  Pours a black color with a small beige head.  Aroma of faint malts, oats and faint oak wood.  Taste of slightly burnt malts, oats and barrel oak.  Has a slight vinous aftertaste.","Doylestown, PA, USA","adrian910ss"
1959,"2009-03-15",4.2,"On tap at Capones. Poured a dark black color with a smaller sized off white/tan head. Aromas of roastiness, woody, smoke, vanilla, and a trace (if any) of bourbon. Tastes of vanilla, woody/oak, dark fruits, roasty, chocolate, the same smokiness, and vanilla. If I wasnt told this was done in a Bourbon Barrel, I would have just guessed Oak Aged.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

1959,"2009-03-12",3.7,"Draft at EBF.  Pours a black body with a tan head.  Nice chocolate, vanilla, oak and some moderate bourbon with a big etoh bite.  Some light roasted notes and fruity esters or etoh latent fruits.  On a more interesting note Danys reviews crack me up.  I have to send this guy some beer! What a character.Earlier Rating: 3/1/2009 Total Score: 3.6Draft at EBF.  Pours a black body with a creamy tan head.  Nice vinous bourbon body, actually its quite powerful in terms of etoh.  Still i found it to be a bit thin and watery bourbon body.  Malt bill was grainy and dry with some light oak in the finish.  It was okay.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"

1959,"2009-03-03",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2009 In short: A chocolaty stout/Belgian crossover.  Nice beer but no improvement over the regular Allagash Black
How: Tap at Boston Extreme Beer Fest 2009
The look: Black body topped by a large tan head
In long: Light-medium roastiness (regular Black feels more roasted).  Body is fluffy and a with a lively carbonation just like the regular Black.  Alcohol a little apparent (no the case with the regular Black).  Sweet dark fruits just like with the regular Black but a little less chocolaty than the regular Black.  Some vanilla here that is not in the regular Black.  All in all this is a decent stout/belgian crossover but the bourbon barrels aging does not add anything worthwhile over the regular Black.  If anything I prefer the regular Black.  There was nothing wrong the original beer so why did they lock it in a barrel for 10 months?  I know.  Its because its a Black.  They wouldnt do that to the Allagash White, would they?  Scandalous.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1959,"2009-03-03",4.0,"Draft, at Night of the Barrels 2/20/09. Pours very deep brown, capped with a moderate-sized brown head. Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, anise, and wood. Flavor is primarily chocolate, with black licorice, anise, vanilla, and dark fruit, with some highlights of oak and vanilla. Long chocolate finish, with hints of black licorice. Not bad.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
1959,"2009-03-01",4.0,"On tap at EBF, labeled as Bourbon Black (Allagash Black aged in Jim Beam Barrles).  Pours a nice deep dark woody black with a thin head.  Aroma is smooth with moderate amounts of wood, oak, sweet vanilla- and bourbon, good roasty and nutty chocolate notes- toned down earth and spicy Belgian character in the original batch.  A bit more bourbon int eh flavor still not overwhelming, good toasty malts, light chocolate sweetness, some roast, light spice, smooth sweetness, and some oak to dry it out in the end.  I think I liked this one quite a bit better than the regular Black.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1959,"2009-01-24",4.3,"On cask at Novare Res.  I really hope i can get this beer again sometime in the future.  This is simply marvelous.  Take the black, add in the barrel aged flavors of the curieux and this is what youve got here.  I do think the black absorbs the whiskey/bourbon flavors so much better though.  The aroma is VERY strong, smells like a glass of Jim Beam, maybe a little hint here and there of the black, but the flavors are much more well balanced.  This beer really shows what barrel aging or conditioning can do.  Im pretty confident this is my favorite Allagash to date.","Portland, Maine, USA","ruggedman"
