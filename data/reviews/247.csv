Medium body that is fuller than normal for the style, but that may be due to being very unfiltered.  It has soft carbonation.  The flavor starts with pale malt, cereal, spice, grass and light dough.  The finish has nice crisp lively hoppiness and full malt.  Excellent take on a kolsch.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
