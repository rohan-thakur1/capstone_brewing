1439,"2017-01-14",2.9,"From the can dated 11/29/16 - Batch 65. It is nice to look at with its reddish-amber, heady pour. The aroma has this weird mashed buttered vegetable character with some caramel malts underneath. But frankly it smells like it was a home brew that was not ready for bottling. Medium body. I get the same olive oil maltiness in the taste. Nothing sweet but a little toastiness. Im thinking that Batch 65 was not as good as the batches that earlier RB members got to try. Maybe I need to give it another chance.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
1439,"2017-01-05",3.7,"4 oz. sample @ The Thirsty Moose-Manchester. Pours a deep, clear copper with a thin white lasting head. Dark fruits and caramel malt on the aroma. Taste leans to sweetness with the caramel malt leading the way followed by a balancing earthy hop bite. Medium bodied. Nice beer!","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"

1439,"2016-11-22",3.8,"Tap at brewery. Pours clear copper. Aroma is pale, toasted, and caramel malts along with some floral hops, faint spice, and faint woodiness.

1439,"2016-10-22",3.5,"Keg pour into taster cup at NH Brewfest. Appearance is dark gold/amber, with 1/2 finger-width of head, decent retention, small amount of lacing, no sparkle. Aroma is malty, yeast. Taste is sweet and strong malts--toward tripel/quadrupel territory--but nice with some mild fruity esters. Palate is medium bodied with average texture, average carbonation and sweet finish. Overall, quite good. A little bit tough rating the aroma and taste with the food tents nearby.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
1439,"2016-05-30",3.6,"Guest Tap at 7th Settlement. Color is indeed a copper tone. Thin lasting head retention. Aroma shows some earthy malts, toffee, raisin, light yeast hints, Toasted grains. . 
The flavor is really interesting. Upfront sweetness of the earthy / dark fruit malts and then the finish hits with a pine and herbal hop kick. Bitterness is moderate and does balance the sweet malt and sugar. Very interesting and kind of hard to know what to make of it. Very creative and I got to admire the ingenuity. Different for sure.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
1439,"2016-01-31",3.9,"Growler from the brewery picked up yesterday. 
Brilliantly clear deep copper color with a smallish bubbly white head that slowly dissipates. Rich caramel and burnt sugary maltiness dominate the aroma with hints of dried fruits, fig and plums, etc. Light spicy earthy hop aroma. The flavor is pretty deep with caramel and burnt sugary goodness, but theres plenty of earthy spicy hops countering nicely. Rich dark dried fruits round out the flavor quite nicely. Big rich caramel maltiness with enough hops to balance the sweetness, really well made beer!","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
