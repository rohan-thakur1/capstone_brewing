Nose is grassy melon tones, peaches, hints of pine and dark malts. Some faint chocolate and nutty tones complimenting the hops. Nice. Taste is brown malty nut tones, grains, pine and hints of herbal grassy notes. Some strange metal-like hints in the back draws back the impression a bit, but otherwise this is a pleasant creation. Medium to full body, medium carbonation. Nice enough, but fails to go the extra mile somehow.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

2018,"2013-02-27",2.8,"33cl bottle from Westholme Stores, Goring. An opaque magohany brown pour with a trace of beige head; rich chocolate malt aroma; in the mouth, the hops dominate at first, giving lots of astringent pine, before a milky stout-like body; the finish is again dominated by the hops and some unbalanced alcohol, but there is also a residual malty sweetness, which is, I guess, why this is called a Brown Ale in the first place. Overall I dont think this is a very successful deviation from what Kernel do best - hoppy pale ales.","Bracknell, Berkshire, ENGLAND","berkshirejohn"

2018,"2012-09-03",3.0,"It poured predictably dark with a large tan head. The aroma was a distinct mix of roast malts and coffee. 


The mouthfeel was smooth and initial impressions were that it was very Porter like. Theres roast malt, some chocolate, and a dark fruit character about it. I would imagine that this is similar to, but easier on the palate than, the original version as its creamy nature would be hard to duplicate in a stronger beer.
