4300,"2017-03-30",3.4,"Keg at Gainsbourg, Gatineau.  Clear golden, small head. Fruity, lightly grassy nose. Mid sweet with medium body and clean, rounded mouthfeel. Fruity with mild bread and grass. Mid bitter finish. More focus on cool elegance than the down to earth drinkability unusually offered by this style.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

4300,"2014-12-10",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Refined pils malt flavors dominate this slender Helles.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the clear golden.
-Weyermann Pils malts truly are lovely when clearly evoked like this.
-The mouthfeel could be fluffier or creamier.
-Flavors are authentic and lengthy.
-Hop bitterness could be upped a bit.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
