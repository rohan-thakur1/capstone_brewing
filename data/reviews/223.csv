223,"2016-03-28",3.9,"Tap at stags head. Fine clear pale gold pour. Nose is citrus and biscuits. Tastes of lime, florals, biscuits, hay, and white grape juice. Flavorful punch kolsch","New York, USA","Jow"
223,"2016-02-23",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2016 Pint can. Nose pale malt, light fruit, strongly floral and really pleasantly so. Pours clear yellow-golden, bright with a very large sudsy bright white head, eventual rough lace. Taste hoppy, floral-noble with pleasant perfume; lightly sweet but sticky pale/pils malt with grainy undertones, bit metallic behind the faint fruit, but really this is a great showcase for fresh, high-quality ingredients and the extra preservation from the can is in its favor. Low bitterness, deft citrus, with just a tick of spiciness on exit before subtle yeast. Medium-full body a bit foamy but soft and expansive/creamy. Clean and suuuper drinkable, love it. [2016.02.23: 3.7]After a few more cans, the thinness and light metallic stabs are readily apparent distractors; even the fruitiness seems forced. [3.4]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
223,"2016-01-10",4.0,"Light floral scent with sweet malts. Bright yellow color crystal clear. Apricot and melon with sweet malts almost brown sugar like for the finish. Medium to full body with nice crisp clean carbonation. Wish this flavor would wrap over and over again. Very nice brew. If this is smutty nose way to go best Ive had yet. And if not want to try more.","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"
223,"2015-12-25",4.0,"This lives up to the awesome name which makes no sense! Slight cloudy yellow white foam. Aroma floral hops, lemons. Tastes grapes, lemons. Slight tartness. Dry. Up there with some of the best sessions.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
223,"2015-12-23",2.3,"Pounder can. Pretty sharp on the uptake. A little haze on a yeller beer. Gets a little more acceptable during the session. Good co2, but not sure if its lively or not. Yes, sharper than yer typical lager, more like a punchy pils perhaps. Refreshing in a citrusy kind of way.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
223,"2015-10-18",3.3,"16 oz can from Dutchs. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a medium sized off white head.

223,"2015-10-15",3.3,"Can. Poured clear pale color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate balanced malt and hop aroma. Medium body with a dry smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable beer and good for style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

223,"2015-10-11",3.1,"16oz can, from Dutchs. Hazy golden orange color, with lots of pale particles in the body. Bigger off-white head, fades to a thin amount, loose bits of lace. Sediment settles to a dark pile on the bottom of the glass. Kind of a spicy, floral, and musty aroma. Medium body. Kind of soft, effervescent moderate carbonation. Mild dry finish. Moderate bitter taste, lighter sweet, touch of tart. Solid and enjoyable, but it seems a touch off to me.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

223,"2015-09-19",3.2,"Super hoppy for a kolsch. Not that it's a bad beer. It's got a nice aroma and a good taste. It's just way off style to me.

223,"2015-09-17",2.8,"473ml can. REally hoppy koelsch beer. Dry and peppry, some zestiness, just super hopped for the style its not good or bad.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
223,"2015-09-15",3.3,"16 oz can purchased at 7-11 Kittery, ME. Unclear clear gold with a ton of yeast and sediment floating around in the liquid. Fast vanishing head that left nothing in its wake. Really ugly looking. Aroma is lager yeast and a weak amount of grassy hops. 
Lots of bready malt and cereal grain with a slightly elevated hop profile. Mild fruit in the center. Mild level of lasting bitterness after the sip. Yeah, its a slightly hoppy kolsch that may get you excited. For me after 6 oz. I was extremely bored.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
223,"2015-09-11",3.9,"Draught at Lord Hobo, 9/3/15.Clear, straw golden with a touch of chill haze and a small white head that slowly recedes to cover. Plentiful carbonation.Very soft, sweetgrass sort of thing going on in the nose with light minerality, tons of rustic hay-like notes and lots of unripened pear skin. Some biscuit malts, a dollop of honey and very clean, with no alcohol noted.Heavy on the pear skin flavor, but its enjoyable, if a bit unusual. Must be the hop variety used? Its got appropriate, moderate bitterness, a supple texture with some graininess thrown in, adding crispness/dryness. Everything is well-attenuated and its quite dry and neo-kolsch-like. Quite nice stuff and very clean.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
223,"2015-09-04",3.9,"From the 1 pint can limited edition dated July 2015. Slightly cloudy straw yellow pour under a full white foamy head that settles down. There is a pleasant German toasted bread character at first followed quickly by a vibrant grassy and pine hop sensation. Medium body. Smooth. Easy drinking. The taste has a decent balance of toasted bread and grassy, piney hops but in the end the malts step forward.

The taste brings out the same sweet and toasted breadiness with a decent pine and grassy hop bitterness. But even though the hops are forward the toastiness wins out in the end.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
223,"2015-08-30",4.0,"Can from Meditrina. Golden with head lace and few floaters. Lemony pastry floral spice aroma. Mild tropical fruit melon pineapple with medium citrus spice bitter dry finish. Light and lively and very refreshing...but not a Kolsch. Much more like a Belgian blonde or session IPA. Nevertheless, delicious.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
223,"2015-08-29",4.0,"Can from the brewery.
Slightly hazy dark yellow color with a huge bubbly white head that persists forever. Spicy citrusy hop aromas with a solid bready grainy pilsner maltiness to counter. Bready crackery malt flavor with some citrus and light fruits to counter. Medium to light body, moderate to high level of carbonation. Pretty damn good summer beer, not sure its a traditional Kolsch but I could drink the hell out of this.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
