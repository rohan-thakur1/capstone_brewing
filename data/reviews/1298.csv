1298,"2015-08-29",3.8,"On draft at the Cambridge House. Pour was dark Amber with a generous head. Aroma of citrus, fruits, caramel, toffee, and earthiness. Flavor captures all and includes caramel. Good hop balance, a hit alt like in depth and balance of malts and hops but hop selection clearly not alty. Man I need to catch that Alt 45 one time up here. Full body. Good stuff for a bland English style ;).","","User37895"
1298,"2014-11-28",2.4,"Sampled at the brewpub, pours a clear copper amber with some lacing white head. Nose is very mild, some apple fruitiness, some lemon, yeast. Flavor is the same, yeasty, bready, some dried fall fruit, faint bathroom soap. Watery finish. Not my favorite.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1298,"2013-08-17",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub.
Comes to the table a hazy medium golden brown color with a small white head that leaves lots of lace. Nice sweet caramel and toffee and brown bread with light earthy hop aroma. Rich malty dark sugar and brown bread with a solid shot of earthy hop and hints of light fruit. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. This was the highlight of the night for me and from a style I usually dont gravitate towards.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
1298,"2013-08-16",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark amber brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of roasted nuts, toffee, caramel, sweet malt. Flavor of toffee, caramel, sweet nutty malt, and bready, crackery malts in the finish. Interesting esb, there is a slight off-ness in the cross between the sweet toffee and crackery malt, but overall it is drinkable and fairly good.

1298,"2013-05-16",3.6,"On tap at the brewery.  Pours brownish copper.  Aroma of a lot of toffee, grains, and caramel from the malts plus light hops.  Flavor the same.   Average texture.  A pretty good beer for the style.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
1298,"2013-01-15",2.8,"Draft at the brewpub.  Hazy, opaque rust-colored beer with a nice creamy head.  Marshy and grainy to a fault.  Bit of an almost sour finish.  Giggles come thru as dirty spice.  (#4904, 1/15/2013)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
1298,"2011-09-24",3.7,"Ive had a lot of great ESBs lately and this is no exception.  Really tasty malt backbone accents really well with fruity hops that balance this very drinkable 6.7% beer.  Loved it.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1298,"2011-09-23",3.7,"Excellent malt bill. Very toasty biscuit like traditional style malts. Hops show in the finish, a lingering bittering. Very nice esb.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1298,"2011-04-20",3.7,"Pours golden with a large white head that doesnt dissipate and leaves a lot of lacing. Theres a sweetness on the nose. The taste has this malty caramel thing going on. Finishes a little too smooth for my tastes but it was fantastic before that.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
1298,"2010-05-28",3.4,"On tap at brewpub in Granby, CT. Pours a caramel color with minimal off-white head. Aroma of malt and sugar. Front palate of caramel and toffee with a creamy middle and smooth finish.","Utah, USA","blindeyedbetty"

1298,"2008-02-17",4.0,"Cambridhe House seems to enjoy taking traditional session style and bumping them up just a bit in both hops and alcohol. From the (too few) beers Ive had from them, this was easily my favourite attempt. A hazy light orange pour covered by a 1cm collard. Very perfumey, rosewater-like nose from, I presume, Styrian Goldings among other things. Very orvalesque in smell. Forward aromatic hoppiness. Subtle biscuity malts underneath, but well attenuated. tremendously refreshing. Soft-medium carbonation, medium-bodied. Completely hidden alcohol.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1298,"2008-02-16",3.8,"Draft, Cambridge House.  Pours a hazy, orange-amber color; off-white head with patchy fine-bubbled lacing.  Very pleasant, biscuity and earthy malt presence in the aroma; light English hop character; relaxed bitterness; approaches the toasty / roasted character of a brown ale.  Medium mouthfeel: emphasis on biscuity / earthy notes throughout, both in the malt character and the mild English hoppiness; very drinkable, slightly fruity, well-composed ESB.  Medium finish: dry, toasty malts and earthy English hops in the finish; dry, toasty, pleasant end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1298,"2007-12-23",3.9,"In short: Wonderful ESB with an American twist.  Great session beer.
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Cloudy dark orange body.  Small beige head leaving good lacing.
In long: Nice full and soft body with a round caramel cake flavour.  The hopping of this beer really did it for me.  Somewhere between an English ESB and an APA.  Leafy hops with juicy orange and dry woody notes.  All merging perfectly with the body leaving a caramelized orange sensation.  Superb stuff, refreshing and tasty.  Not what Im used to from a typical ESB, probably a new style Extremely Satisfying Beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1298,"2007-12-19",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Prominent earthy, leafy hoppiness plays with a delicate caramel maltiness in this very quaffable but treacherously strong ESB.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the orangey amber haze.
-Again, effervescence is rather high, which in this particular case increases drinkability, but makes it harder to appreciate the malts intricacies.
-There arent that many residual sugars for a beer this gravity, so the body is lean and the sips get larger and larger as you drink.
-A leafy and resinous hop bitterness carefully punctuates the finish.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1298,"2007-07-28",3.5,"Just what you expect an ESB to be: sweet but nowhere near cloying, balanced with some nice hoppy bite. Some traditional sweet malty flavors and some earthy tones too.","Connecticut, USA","TrevorFloyd"

1298,"2006-02-24",3.7,"Pours amber with a thin off white head.  Smells fruity and citrussy with some yogurt notes.  Taste is slightly rosey with some citrussy elements and a decent sweet finish.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

1298,"2005-08-20",3.3,"on tap at the brewpub...hazy copper pour with medium fizzy white head.  Malty aroma, albeit faint.  Nice crisp clean flavor, moderately hoppy, citrusy malt flavors.  Decent bitterness lingering.","Chazy, New York, USA","ChazyRPh"
1298,"2005-04-16",3.6,"On tap last week at the brewpub.  Sugary, sweet citrusy orange aroma with hints of peppers.  Seems a little sweet, though.  Mildly hazy copper color with a frothy off-white head and nice lacing.  Floral hopped bitter notes to start turning citrusy bitter to finish.  A tad thin, and not as malty as Id like.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
1298,"2005-04-15",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2005 Draught:  This was nice.  It pours a very nice slightly hazy coppery amber color.  There wasnt much head on it at all, as well as little carbonation.  The aroma was slightly caramel and piney hops. There were also hints of coffee and roastiness.   Slightly above a medium bodied beer.  The taste was quite pleasant.  Good caramel and hops balance.  The coffee and roastiness just peeks its head out also.  A very tasty brew. A little high on alcohol for a session beer, but then again I can walk home from here!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
