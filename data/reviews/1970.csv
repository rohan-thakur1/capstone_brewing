Poured beautifully - jet black in this bulb of a glass and with a huge persistent spongy beige head - looks like a real ale I poured myself. Palate is a little harsh, ashy, a bit dusty and acidic from that. Very deep roast, some almondiness, and alas a bit of alcohol too.

Flavour is packed full of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate thats really high in cocoa %. Some smokey, burnt notes carry through to the finish which gives a slightly sweet caramel taste and even a touch of dark fruit. Silky body with subdued carbonation makes it so incredibly drinkable.

1970,"2013-11-04",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2014 Bottle at home in London. Version with ABV of 7.4%, bottled on 06/02/2013, so the beer has had plenty of time to develop. Pours deep brown-black with a huge, lasting beige foam head. The aroma is quite dynamic, with plenty of well roasted malts at the core, surrounded by baking cocoa, some dark fruits and toasted bread. Medium sweet flavor with rich, slightly bittersweet cocoa, restrained charred malts, some raisins, chocolate cake, light flinty minerals, some dark bread, milk chocolate. Medium to full bodied with average carbonation and an exceedingly creamy mouthfeel. The finish has just a touch of alcohol warmth, followed by lots more richly roasted malts, baking cocoa, moderate scorched earth bitterness, ash, slight tobacco and further chocolate cake. Rich and complex, this beer is also impressively well balanced and drinkable. If you happen to be sitting on a bottle of this beer that was released in early 2013, I would drink it now because I cannot envision it getting any better than this.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

Big flavours. Will do well on this site for ratings I think. And I like it. Big hop, big choc malt. Not ruined by being barrel aged. Yet. Even some cassis on the aroma and more in the flavour. Some lightish espresso coffee. Mouthfeel is good. Its an enjoyable strong stout. Probably the best beer Ive had from these guys so far. Yes, a good stout. Maybe just lacking a touch of character on the swallow. Super drinkability though.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
