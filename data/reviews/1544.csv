1544,"2016-11-17",3.5,"Deep super hazy amber and dark tinted copper and bronze body with a thinnish, single centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of grass, wheat, oranges, coriander seed, light hops, tropical fruits and a touch of unfinished sugars as well. Medium-bodied; Strong wheatie flavour at first with a large taste of oranges and citrus along with some lighter hop elements and some yeast and biscuits as well. Aftertaste shows the sugars, a touch of citrus, a little grain, some bitterness from the hops and a dry, almost cedar-like flavour that brings out the complexities at the finish. Overall, a good wheat ale that shows some nice fruit, hop and yeast complexities, but not a close comparison to Three Floyds Gumballhead...which still is much better. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Downtown Spirits in Seattle, Washington [State] on 18-February-2016 for US$5,99 sampled at home in [the real] Washington on 16-November-2016.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

This is a much better than many American Wheat Ales, who as a matter of routine style, are very simple and boring. BJCP 7/3/14/4/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"

I like the best before language on this one: Not as awesome after 03/03/16. Well, that might be true, but it still lives up to its name almost three months after that: solid. Wish I had gotten it fresh - maybe then it wouldve been Solid!, or even awesome. (14/20)","CANADA","UXO"
1544,"2016-04-12",3.4,"Bottle, shared with Parksy, Grippitis, and PQ. Hazy golden body, thick creamy white head that retains beautifully. Equally malty and hoppy, bready wheat matls with a citrus kiss and assertive bitterness. Not as aromatic as I hoped, especially given the comparison to Gumball on the label.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
1544,"2016-03-30",3.3,"Slight haze and a bubbly head. Nice fresh papaya and citrus nose and a similar flavour. Lots of bitterness. Maybe a touch if toastiness in the malts.

1544,"2016-01-12",4.5,"Gigantic Solid? Ive got your Gigantic Solid right here. Its pale-colored and has a big, white head. Its smooth. Youll like having it. In your mouth. Youll notice orange, pineapple, cream, and kumquat. Itll linger when it finishes. In your mouth. Damn, Ive never managed to be inappropriate for an ENTIRE review before... What can I say? Gigantic Solid was an easy innuendo and Im not one to let that pass. On a non-pervy or immature note, Solid also has floral and spicy elements. Looking forward to having more from Gigantic.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Flavour is quite fruity, with stone fruits, piney and resinous hops, and a little biscuity malt. Man, tastes like a rather aggressive IPA, not a hopped wheat. Whatever it is, this works really well. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1544,"2015-10-24",3.5,"On draft at Artistic Table. It pours a light orange color with an off white head. The aroma has orange, lime, white grape and maybe some florals. The flavor is fuller bodied than expected with orange, lime and a hint of caramel. Solid floral bitterness.

A: Cloudy brown with a huge creme color head. Kind of gnarly looking really.

N: Pine, soap, lavender, cracker, wheat, some pineapple and grapefruit hanging around in the background.

T: Bitter nearly to astringency and dryly sweet.

M: Light body, prickly carbonation, no alcohol. Very dry.

O: Not sure what to think of this one. Its got a really nice hop profile marred by the soap and theres not much balance here nor the complexity to get away with it.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
