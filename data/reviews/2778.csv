2778,"2013-03-16",3.2,"From bottle at bottleshop in Prague. Dark gold-amber pour with thin white head. Grainy aroma, light fruitiness, light banana, caramel and spice. Taste of light toasted grain, hoppy finish. Well executed but a bit dull.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2778,"2013-03-10",3.3,"My Bottom Line:
Spicy hops and lightly toasted malts coalesce in this prickly Vienna-like brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the misty amber.
-This tastes like a cross between a Vienna (not Polotmavé) and Svetly.
-The flavor profile is balanced.
-The mouthfeel is lean and highly drinkable.

Fresh PET bottle.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
