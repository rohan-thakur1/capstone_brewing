3448,"2017-06-20",4.6,"(355 ml bottle) Having searched high and low for this infamous beer, I finally found a small stock, in a bottle shop in Hannover. Four months later, I finally decided to crack it open, to celebrate finishing another round of university exams.

As soon as the cap leaves the bottle, the aroma rises in wisps of smoke. This beer is no ordinary beer. A syrup-like fluid glugs into the glass: close to jet-black, with a chestnut hue. Its carbonated with little streams of fine bubbles, which form a small, tan-coloured head.

The aroma is irresistibly seductive: bags of dark chocolate and roasted coffee; then vanilla, and smooth Kentucky bourbon; rich brandy cream; raisins, and cinnamon; clove and walnuts; mineral water, tobacco smoke, charred oak, brown sugar, rum, alcohol, and freshly-tanned leather. 

Despite being served at cellar temperature, the alcohol immediately warms the mouth, throat, and stomach. The whisky combines and magnifies the aromas - its a drink within a drink. And the mouthfeel is silky, creamy and smooth. It lies on the palate and coats the tongue like no other beer Ive ever tried.

Its almost a shame that this stout is flavoured. But, the coffee and chocolate only bring out the best in what the malt and hops provide. 

A wonderful beer - surely one of the worlds best.","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","victorsampson96"

Its a difficult ale to analyze since the taste of roast is so clear that I think it is difficult to describe much more but theres definitely more layers to the ale and the top layer of roast isnt spoiling at all. The sweetness might have traces of banana, but I guess it also might be vanilla as it is a long warm sweetness.

The color is dark-dark brown or black, and it had a large head with a light brown color. The foam disappeared a bit quickly though.

Taste wise it has a clear sweetness to it, but the bitters blend in perfectly.

A really thick and oily ale, feels a bit like whole milk in the mouth. The only negative thing in my opinion is the soft carbonation as I prefer a little sting. Luckily the alcohol provides a sting on its own which makes up for it.

The flavour is huge, and similar to the standard Breakfast Stout, but with the bourbon edge and some extra booziness. It features masses of chocolate and coffee, some vanilla and hints of caramel, with some light roasty bitterness. the palate is thick and creamy, and the carbonation soft. A magnificent brew, though my failure to fully embrace barrel aged beasties means I cant rate it higher than the standard Breakfast edition.

Intense aroma of dark roasted malt, dark and bitter chocolate, cocoa, strong coffee and fruits, with alcohol and ash in the back. Quite intense flavour that follows the aroma, but with more pronounced ashy notes, and also quite obvious influence from the barrel ageing: wood, a bit too boozy bourbon and some vanilla. Moderate to heavy sweet taste with a very long-lasting and heavy bitter finish. Full-bodied, creamy and smooth mouthfeel, soft carbonation.

Arômes de chocolat noir onctueux, vanille, pâte à biscuit, crème de café, malt légèrement caramélisé, le tout sur un fond de bourbon sucré se mêlant à merveille aux autres effluves. En bouche, cest carrément un dessert liquide. Brownies au chocolat noir, liqueur de noisettes, vanille, café latte. Tout cela sans devenir trop sucré et lourd. On perçoit quelques saveurs de caramel fraîchement fondu et de malt grillé au même moment que le liquide semble vouloir sépaissir. La finale est très axée sur le chocolat noir mais aussi sur le bois arrosé de bourbon et bien sûr du café moyennement torréfié qui forme un duo parfait avec le chocolat. Le bourbon nest aucunement mis de lavant et ne fait que se mêler parfaitement au reste. Il est plus présent de longues secondes après une gorgée où on sent son côté épicé/alcoolisé.

De intensidad media-alta en nariz (probablemente, porque una vez más no me he podido esperar el tiempo suficiente a que se atemperara; la tentación era demasiado grande). Enseguida salen las notas de chocolate y licorosas, que reinan sobre las demás: notas de café, un puntito de regaliz, una nota muy seca que no acabo de identificar y que resulta extremadamente agradable y algo de ciruela pasa bastante clara. Sin duda compleja. Su generosa graduación alcohólica ya se percibe en nariz, aunque de forma contenida y terriblemente elegante. Sin duda alguna, en nariz es una de las mejores cervezas que he tenido el placer de probar. Huele tan bién que casi da pena empezar a bebértela. Pero creo que lo superaré

Vierte en color castaño muy oscuro, que en la copa resulta opaco a pesar de lo cual, es una cerveza claramente brillante e incluso bonita. La espuma es muy escasa, de color café y con burbuja muy pequeña. Sorprende mucho la extraordinaria persistencia de la corona de espuma para ser tan poco abundante. Las lágrimas son perfectamente apreciables y dan a la cerveza un aspecto licoroso y muy elegante.

En boca es Impresionante. ¡Qué maravilla de cerveza! Me repongo y sigo con las notas de cata. De entre los sabores básicos destacan el dulce y el amargo, en un equilibrio absolutamente perfecto, agradabilísimos y jamás dulzona o agresiva. El café sale aquí con toda su fuerza, acompañado por el chocolate. Si el alcohol resultaba evidente en nariz, en boca parece mucho más suave, sin perder el grato toque licoroso. El sabor en su conjunto es una auténtica delicia, para paladearlo con calma, ...aunque a la vez con prisa de echar otro poco de cerveza a la boca.

Gran cuerpo, textura sedosa, indudablemente cálida y con una persistencia en boca media-alta. Llena perfectamente la boca sin apoderarse de ella. Lo hace a la vez de una forma delicada pero con carácter, dejando una sensación en boca de absoluto placer cervecero. Soberbia!

Generalmente, cuando pruebo una cerveza en la que tengo altas expectativas, tiende a decepcionarme un poco (sin duda por culpa de mis expectativas, no de la cerveza), pero en esta ocasión las ha superado de lejos. Es una cerveza con una elegancia arrolladora, impresionante en nariz e increíblemente deliciosa en boca.

Slight dryness from roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness as well. Light-medium carbonation and full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and slightly tannic/chalky mouthfeel that is awesome. Minimal warming alcohol for 11.8%, with zero barrel booziness.

Hieman on myös vanilijaa ja makeaa vaahtokarkkimaisuutta, sekin ehkä vanilijasta. Maku on edelleen vahvan kahvinen, mutta viskisyys on lähes yhtä vahvaa. Hiven on myös suklaisuutta sekä puumaisuutta, varmaankin tynnyristä. Myös lakritsia löytyy, hieman yllättäen mukaan ja jälkimaussa on vanilijaista makeutta.

3448,"2017-02-10",4.5,"355 ml bottle at abv 11.9% bought at HK Brewcraft in Central.
Looks: Deep, tan blackish brown colour; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy dark beige foam which fades in 15 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with barely notable bubbly carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant dark malt which can be smelt a foot away, with strong roastyness, strong chocolate, strong vanilla, roasted coffee, bourbon, strong oak barrels, strong cream, caramel, sticky toffee, raisins, dark fruits, waffles, alcohol, sugar, dry bread and grass. Very smooth and seductive! 

Taste: Strong sweet, very rich dark malt, with strong roastyness, bourbon, rum, strong liquorices, smooth oak barrel, caramel, burnt toffee, strong burnt toast, strong black coffee, dark chocolate, floral, strong brown sugar, strong herbs, dry biscuits, strong lemon and strong bitter grassy hops. Very robust and layered. Wow!

Body: Full body. Oily and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich dark maltyness in a very thick background, of which oat smoothness played a big part. Liquor hit first, followed by French oak and strong burnt toffee and bitter toasty malt. Black coffee and chocolate come on strong as beer warms. Quite flowery with strong nice brown sugar sweetness. Biscuity with strong lemon to round. Powerful yet very smooth!

Alcohol: the 11.9% booze with bourbon barrel is potent, but never come across as train wreck at any point. The liquor is a combo of light bourbon and rum, pretty restrained and tasty. The best of all it is smoothed out by the rich French oak and vanilla which makes it so easy (and dangerous) to down. A well-produced rarity. A big Yes for me! 

Hoppiness: Grass in nose. Strong herbs, strong lemon and strong grass in taste; Bitterness - burnt malt, liquorices and hops - is very strong for a lasting, very high astringent sweet-bitter herbal malty finish.

After Taste: Dry. Liquorish and very herbal bitter to mouth.

Comments: I normally dont like barrel-aged RIS because the barreled whisky / rum / whatever simply overwhelmed the otherwise well-brewed dark stouts. In this case, the brewers worked magic with the bourbon barrel with lasting vanilla aroma, and a nice neat rum-bourbon liquor taste. The booze never upstage the RIS proper, which packs a complex oat creamy smoothness, strong fresh black coffee, very toasty burnt malt, and massive bitterness. The overall effect is powerful yet very likeable. Very well made and very well managed. A fellow reviewer described this one being the Rolls Royce of RIS, which sums it up pretty well. A must try and must buy!

P.S. As soon as I snapped it up, I knew this one will be my perfect 1800th beer rating, and I got it right! :-P","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Smagen er kaffe-vanilje drøn, med en voldsom og langsomt overvældende sprittet råhed af bourbon. Bliver mere spiritus end øl i eftersmagen! Hvilket jeg nu egentlig godt kan lide!
Men alligevel: Måske den bliver for bourbon-agtig undervejs (kan det blive det?!) - nå noget nyt dukker op, fx lidt honningsødme, lidt røg, så kommer vaniljesprutten og banker det ned. Det må nok ses som en begrænsning; at den ikke udvikler sig.

And so here we are IMPERIAL STOUT #100
Some people make occasions for such things - in this case, the beer is the occasion.
Been a rather odd lead up - weather turned grey, heavens open up with howling winds, and I found a gosling in a trough half dead that Im currently nursing back to health - its times like these you need something to take your mind off the world outside...
A viscous obsidian liquid is poured from the body - thick, like sump oil. An espresso-like dark tan creamer rises up & holds; taking its sweet ass time to drop down into a dense cap & painting the glass with cappuccino-like stains in its wake.
Theres an assault to the olfactory upfront - heavy on the bourbon undoubtedly, like cracking open a good bottle of Bakers - in itself complex with layers of vanilla, and charcoal, and sour mash grains. That combines with rich liqueur-like coffee, or maybe slow drip? Has a good deep cocoa note about it too, and burnt, almost blackened sugar.
Mouthfeel is what gets me first - this is not nearly as rich as most beers of this strength - quite well attenuated, dry, rather boozy, warm, get some woody tannin in there - very reminiscent of a swig of good Bourbon - that smoothness, yet dryness.
Palate doesnt quite deliver what the nose promises, but its bloody nice! Bourbon up the wazoo - charred wood, sour mash twang, vanilla, toast, sort of overly ripe apricot, lots of wood! like massively. Chocolate, dark, coffee, strong, sugar, dark & strong & kinda burnt with burnt raisiny notes, smoky but not in a conventional manner. Smoooth finish, yet theres a sort of acrid coffee & woody bitterness that counterpoints everything, sort of spurring you on as you take the journey.
This is spectacular! And it must be said, Im not a huge Bourbon fan (single malt Scotch fan), but the execution & intensity here is second to none!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
3448,"2016-10-19",4.7,"Black color. Medium-sized , beige head . Chocolate, vanilla , dark fruits, caramel, wood and bourbon in complex aroma.

En vista posee una corona de espuma mediana con perlas compactas y de ligera tonalidad canela, hay poca retención por la gran densidad del cuerpo y el contenido de ingredientes y alcohol, el liquido es de color obscuro opaco, no tiene destellos o tonalidades mas claras ya que no entra la luz, aspecto muy correcto al estilo.
En aroma es muy evidente el aporte del envejecimiento en barricas ya que de inicio el aroma es muy amaderado, hay notas a café, chocolate, nuez y almendras, algo de aroma a pasas, licor como a jerez, muy compleja y agresiva.
En el sabor igualmente se presenta el amaderado, mucho chocolate dulce, carácter a café, frutos secos como; almendras, nuez y ciruelas, hay dulzor a caramelo y azúcar morena, los 12.4% de alcohol son perceptibles en gusto y calidez en garganta, incluso el carácter de madera lo exalta, no hay acidez ya que el reposo pule y elimina dichos sabores, muy rica y potente, el retrogusto es pesado, achocolatado y dulce que se prolonga bastante.","MEXICO","Yased"

First real divergence from year-to-year comes through in the taste. 2015 - very smooth, semisweet chocolate, woody vanilla, big bourbon, espresso, fainter notes of anise, molasses, and toffee. 2016 - still smooth, coffee and bittersweet chocolate and vanilla much more at the forefront, more muted bourbon, oak, molasses, and caramel, some heat at the back of the throat that isn't present in the 2015; it doesn't detract at all, just a noticeable difference. After the initial side-by-side we poured a one-to-one mixture of the 2015 and 2016. They both were great individually, but the mixture was stupendous.

Roasty malty qualities are accompanied by nuances such as vanilla and ripe dark fruitiness. Aging shows but does not dim hoppiness that also adds attributes to the varied mix.

3448,"2016-06-19",4.1,"12.4%ABV. Imperial Stout.

Poured out black and oily with a nice thin tan head. 40ºSRM.

Nose from afar, you get sweet funk of molasses, closer you get dark chocolate and the smokiness of coffee.

Mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy. Strongly alcoholic and medicinal. Palate has black bread, rye toast spiciness, and bourbon. There is a charcoal, smoky finish with alcoholic heat at the back of the throat. There is also a pleasant full-bodied woody or dried aged wood overtone in the palate that rides the alcohol very nicely. I expected a lot of sweetness and fruit from the way it nosed and poured, but this has all the flavor character of a whisky tasting.

Aftertaste of chocolate and some coffee and vanilla.

Palate may be a bit harsh for the uninitiated, but should be right up the alley of someone who likes a good rye bourbon.

Remember that you wont be able to taste much of anything else after this one, so make it count.

Never dries out, but bitterness, booze and oak all register at the end. A let down after the fine aroma - the non beer things are too much and theyre not that good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

3448,"2016-05-30",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2017 Pours black with good tan head but doesnt last long. Aroma is full on sweet oak, with a hint of roasted malts and spice. Taste is, again, full on oak sweetness with hints of chocolate and coffee. Medium carbonation and thick mouth feel. Finish is oak bitterness. I love bourbon and imperial stouts but this is far too oaky for me - it really doesnt taste of beer. Very disappointed :(

Re-rating: This beer is much better served 15C. At 4C it was as rated above.  Once it has reached room temp the oak subsides to a more chocolate/coffee beer.  The balance is far better now with the oak mostly on the finish.  There is still a noticeable alcohol burn but then again it is 12.4%. Just make sure to serve at room temp.","Tyne & Wear, ENGLAND","allanmb"

3448,"2016-05-29",4.4,"RIS warzony z dodatkiem czekolady i kawy leżakowany w dębowych beczkach po bourbonie. Edycja 2016.  
 Alkohol:  12,4% obj. 
 Data butelkowania:  11.02.2016 
 Kolor:  Czarny jak węgiel. Brak jakichkolwiek przebłysków. 
 Piana:  Średniowysoka, beżowa, grubo i średnioziarnista. Może nie jest aż tak puszysta jakbym tego oczekiwał, ale wciąż pięknie znaczy ścianki Sniftera.
Po zamieszaniu szkłem odbudowuje się delikatnie i spływa w dół po krawędziach.
Rozległa oponka oddziela ostatnią warstwę trunku. 
 Zapach:  Bardzo piętrowy, wielowarstwowy zapach.
Zdecydowane nuty beczki po bourbonie. Nie ma się co dziwić piwo spędziło tam ponad rok. Mokre drewno, trochę rumu, trochę whisky, chwilami nawet czerwone wino. Mnóstwo odnośników do szlechetnego alkoholu.
Gorzka czekolada dochodzi po nieznacznym ogrzaniu, a na sam koniec delikatna sugestia świeżo palonej kawy.
Paloność na niskim poziomie. Alkohol w aromacie zupełnie niezauważalny. 
 Smak:  Smak jest zdecydowanie wieloelementowy. Beczka po bourbonie daje wyraźne motywy mokrego drewna, dębiny oraz szlachetnego alkoholu.
Gorzka czekolada wypełnia swoją słodyczą usta i podniebienie.
Słodycz rozchodzi się równomiernie. Kontrują ją nuty kawy Mocha i delikatne orzechowe posmaki. Za nimi minimalna lukrecja i karmel.
Po ogrzaniu pojawia się pokaźna wanilia.
Goryczka dość wysoka, ale krótka i szybko znikająca.
Odczucie w ustach pełne, kremowe, aksamitne.
Przyjemnie rozgrzewający alkohol dochodzi do głosu jedynie już po zakończonej degustacji.
Wspaniałe piwo, chociaż jeszcze nie genialne xD 
 Wysycenie: Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Jedna z tych tzw. ""perełek"" na które poluje się od dawna. Szukałem tego piwa przez długi czas. Udało mi się go zdobyć w jedym jedynym miejscu w San Francisco. 

Wracając do KBS-a.
Piwo to wypuszczane jest na rynek tylko raz do roku w bardzo limitowanych ilościach. Edycja 2016 trafiła na rynek 
1 kwietnia 2016.
Miałem to szczęście, że połowie kwietnia byłem w USA i udało mi się cudem dorwać KBS-a.

Najfajniejszą i najbardziej godną uwagi informacją była cena za tego RIS-a.
Zapłaciłem za niego $5!!! Można było kupić tylko 1 buteleczkę na osobę.
Browar ustalił taką cenę i mimo limitowanej ilości nikt nie pragnęł wcale zdzierać pieniędzy od jego miłośników. 
Wielki szacun za to! (Dla porówniania Bourbon Stout z Goose Island kosztował $16). Bardzo się cieszę, że udało mi się spróbować tego RIS-a.

Dodam na koniec, że z tych RIS-ów, które piłem nie jest to RIS wybitny, ale z całą pewnością b.dobry.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Taste is mainly chocolate, coffee and roasty tones and after a while a harsh finish when the bourbon tones hits in. The licorice turns more obvious as the beer is getting warmer.

3448,"2016-05-19",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2017 5/19/2016: This is a 2016 version. Pours a dark brown almost black with a medium sized khaki head with some red notes in it. The aroma is of alcohol and bourbon. There is also hints of vanilla. The taste is alcohol and bourbon right up front. There is quite a bit of a warming in the taste as well. I also pick up some vanilla as well. 

4/23/2017: I am comparing a 2016 and 2017 vintage. The appearance is very similar with a dark brown almost completely black but the 2017 has a much creamier khaki head than the 2016. The aromas are very different right off the bat. The 2016 version has lots of oakiness, vanilla, alcohol, and faint notes of coffee with some charred roasted malts. The 2017 version is coffee and lots of it right up front. The malts are more dark roasted than charred. There is some sweetness in there as well. The aroma definitely goes to the 2017 vintage. The flavors are also very different with where they can be detected on the palette. I wonder if each years vintage is brewed slightly different. In the 2016 vintage, you get some booziness but not overpowering up front with some oakiness and vanilla and it finishes with lots of chocolate and coffee. In the 2017 vintage, you get hit with lots of coffee, chocolate, vanilla up front and in the finish you pick up some booziness and alcohol. Coffee is known to go away over time so I am not too surprised by that. The mouthfeel is heavy and drinkability is quite low. Obviously this is more of a sipper than a gulper.","Lewisville, Texas, USA","Brandon1989"

Once this was allowed to decant to room temperature, this truly blossomed into an exceptional representation of the style. The mouthfeel was more rounded and silky.

Thanks, Tom!

My wifes uncle, Tom, brought this as a gift, along with Trapistes Rochefort 8 and Acoustic Ales Instant Triple Karma. Unbelievably nice as I hadnt had the chance so have either. I had obviously really been looking for this one. Wasnt sure what he paid for it (was able to check the other prices on the places website), but have heard others pay anywhere from $7 for a single bottle to $24 for a 6-pack. Have unbelievably high expectations for this one. Im talking 4.60 range. 

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy, tan head. Great uneven, spiderweb lacing. Very good retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled dark milk chocolate and black coffee malts. After second effort got smooth bourbon, oaky wood, booziness, toffee, caramel, crayon, hints of vanilla and roasted hazelnut. Reminding me a bit of Tioga-Sequoias Autumn Rush. (Smell - 4.25)

Taste followed the nose nicely. Still reminding me of TSAR. Got dark milk chocolate, boozy bourbon, oaky wood, creamy vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate milkshake, roasted coffee malts, toffee, caramel, Oreo cookies, wet cocoa and hints of spice (cinnamon?). (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)

This was just an awesome beer. I still think I slightly overrated it a tad with the pedigree, but so be it. It is not elite to me, but just a great beer. (Overall - 4.25)

Almost full body with a texture that is creamy and possesses an oily character as well. Superb carbonation with a nice effervescent middle coupled with a very prickly finish.

The flavor profile is world class. It is intense, complex and masterfully balanced. Bourbon is the primary flavor but is buttressed by a rich malt base that pops with roast producing a somewhat sweet stout. Coffee, oak and chocolate comprise the supporting cast of this renowned stout. Bitterness is mild in the middle with roast rather evident over a subtle oak character. From the middle on, chocolate notes are ascending to challenge the bourbon. The finish has a bit of heat and subtle astringency that actually add to the complexity of this masterpiece. At the end, a long slow fade of chocolate lingers.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

I enjoyed the warming alcohol touches that gave the beer a nice kick & despite the strength it still proved an easier than expected beer to drink. A beautiful beer & one of the best I think Ive tried, Im definitely looking forward to trying this one again now.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

3448,"2015-11-27",4.5,"Bottle, 355 ml. Acquired from The Keans Head, Nottingham. Bottled 23/3/2014. Pours black with a small amount of medium tan head. Thick brown lacing is present. 

Aroma, 5-10 minutes out of fridge: The effects of the barrel aging are immediately apparent on the nose with a prominent bourbon and oak notes permeating right through the rest of the aromas. Espresso and generally dark coffee notes are right at the forefront, with a strongly roasted/almost burned edge to them. Deeper in, chocolate becomes more prominent; thinking milk chocolate or milk chocolate digestive biscuits. Slightly burnt/smokey edges from the malt too. Tiny hints of roasted meat and a little bit of pipe tobacco. Virtually no detectable alcohol. 

Approaching room temperature: some nutty and oaty, cereal-y notes start to emerge, also quite roasted. Roasted peanuts perhaps. Chocolate notes becoming less bitter and closer to full-on milk chocolate like youd get in chocolate bar, specifically cadburys. Vanilla starting to emerge too. Peanut butter maybe as well? Little bit of alcohol now.

Taste: bitter coffee and bourbon throughout with dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, brandy/cognac, maybe some muscavado sugar or navy rum initially. The rum and brandy stick around on the edge of the tongue while the coffee and bourbon permeate across the palate. More bitter notes in the middle, burnt malts and espresso. Finish/aftertaste is more coffee and a little bit of biscuit or cereal, though not quite as bitter at this point, with much of the bitterness having been left on the tongue. Somewhat more of an abrupt/dry finish than expected. Quite dry. Bit of alcohol taste and a significant warmth, as expected, though no burn whatsoever. Lots of vanilla emerges later on, and the cognac notes become more prominent. Chocolate/chocolate biscuits also become more noticeable in the aftertaste, which starts to lengthen.

Palate: absolute delight; full body, thick, oily texture, minimal carbonation, no alcohol burn, smooth as you like. 

Pretty fantastically crafted brew overall, with a brilliant mixture of flavours while definitely tending more towards the sweeter side of things, and probably the best barrel aged beer ive had, thouh not quite the best imperial stout ive had in general. Well worth the somewhat inflated price I paid for one of the few bottles available here in the UK.","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

Pours a pitch black body with a 1/4 inch dark chocolate head. Head retention and lacing are average for a barrel aged imperial stout. 

Smells of vanilla, coffee, chocolate malt, and burnt oak. As beer warms, sweet bourbon comes through. 

Taste is of cold bitter coffee, charred oak, with a warm bourbon finish. Sweet vanilla comes in and out but bitter coffee and alcohol are main flavors. 

Mouthfeel is medium but for such a dark and high abv stout, not the desired consistency. Head added nothing to the body.

O- What a beauty of a beer. Got this bottle fresh and while it seems to be preferred fresh, I decided to wait a few month, 9 to be exact to let it settle a bit as I like the regular Breakfast Stout best at 2 years of age. Man, I almost wish Id have waited a bit longer. At first pour, this is heavy on the booze, booze, booze. Almost all you get. The head fades quick and the aroma remains but the booze subsides and out comes the chocolate. The coffee was very very subdued. The taste was a nice chocolate, rich, and complex flavor. The palate had a bit of boozy heat on the finish but still smooth. Overall, I have to admit I still prefer the regular Breakfast Stout, but this is nothing to shy away from.

3448,"2015-07-22",4.6,"Originally reviewed 10/28/2011. 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. 2011 vintage. Jet black with a small tan head. It dissipates with some wispy lacing on top. Smell is coffee, bourbon, and heavy roasted malts. Dark, burnt chocolate. Whats amazing is how well all three components shine through, without any one overshadowing the others.

Taste follows the smell. Bourbon first, then some coffee, followed by a very roasty malt character. Its fairly bitter throughout, mostly from the coffee and the roasted malts, which give off even more coffee flavor. Distinguishable is a chocolate flavor, but its very dark and very burnt. I first thought the malts were a bit harsh, but on a second tasting, I appreciate more than Founders could maintain the intense stout flavor among the bourbon and coffee. Amazingly light, considering the ABV. Low carbonation, but thats to be expected. It finishes quite bitter, which makes the lingering flavors a little bit harsh. A thicker beer might make for some mellowing of these effects.

Aroma is coffee, chocolate, dark roasted malts and not least bourbon, lots of it on the nose!


Not a big fan of bourbon but i do see some improvements to certain stouts when done in moderation, lots of them tend to soak up to much and end up tasting like a bourbon mixed drink of sorts. Taste on this one reveals the nose is bigger than the taste on that note though, rich coffee tones, both dark and lighter tones of chocolate. Everything topped with just the right amount of bourbon. Very nice stout indeed!

The hype around this beer, had me approaching it looking down my pince-nez.... It is fantastic, I love founders, and this is such a beautifully balanced, outstanding beer.

Pours dark black, quite high carbonation, brief brown foam which vanished almost immediately. Dominated by the coffee and bourbon, any roasty malt flavours or hops play a background role here. Strong vanilla, I guess from the bourbon. Strong coffee too, a bit of an aftertaste like chewing on coffee beans, grainy, bitter and a bit harsh. Its nice. Reasonably complex I suppose. But its dominated by all the extra stuff that wouldnt normally be in beer, the coffee and the barrel ageing. I like coffee. I like bourbon. I like chocolate quite a lot. I dont mind that oaky vanilla taste.

Taste starts with bourbon, very sweet - then into a smoked woody chocolate in the middle, drying slightly. Booze and cocoa powder travels to the nose, and finally it finishes oily and sticky (and thin) with some coffee coming out alongside the cocoa. Aroma is very solid, but taste has all the right elements with sharp corners. Hopefully age will smooth those out, but I worry it?s too rough up front and thin in the end. Not as good as I thought.

Pours a rich frothy black, with a tan head that dissipates fast and leaves some great clingy lacing on my snifter glass. I let this one warm up a long time before taking my first sip. During that time I smelled coffee, dark chocolate, malt, port/sherry, earthy and woody notes, and some smoke and slight vanilla too. First taste is a huge explosion of differing sensations- vanilla sweetness, bitter coffee and chocolate like tastes, some very subtle earthy malt in there too. As it warmed the aroma really got strong- toffee, leather, licorice coming out. The mouthfeel is perfect- the co2 levels are perfectly balanced in this beer. Its a full bodied beer, creamy texture in the mouth almost velvety. I described it to a friends as drinking a ""cloud of beer"" The finish is long and delicious.

Never overpowering in any one regard the bourbon barrel does come to the fore. Rich vanilla bean, booziness and dark roast coffee follow with a nice hint of floral/orange hop presence. There is also a nice smoky/woody underpinning that holds everything together. The taste is rich complex and well balanced, but you better like bourbon. Not overpowering yet bourbon is the star of the show. Lightly sweet and medium bitter the carbonation is soft and the finish is long and rewarding. The texture is slightly sticky but the beer is never overly heavy. It is definitely a sipper. Overall ...A huge yes please! This stout is substantial and fulfilling a tad bid boozy but a whale worth spearing. Im really liking how this opens up with time and the emerging coffee and semi-bitter chocolate notes.

After sitting for a while it warms into different notes, much stronger vanilla, a bourbon sweetness now has become very noticable, the chocolate sweetness to chocolate milk at oats are the grain of all that I pick out.

3448,"2015-03-17",3.6,"5 oz pour from tap into a pint glass.

Appearance: Your standard stout - very dark brown verging on black, with a khaki head with decent retention.

Smell: Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon wafts out of the glass, with some vanilla that I primarily attribute to the bourbon.

Taste: Dark roasted malt meets some bitter chocolate and a heaping helping of coffee, much like a dark French roast. Beneath all of that, faintly, there were some vestiges of bourbon flavor - a shadow of vanilla, maybe a whisper of oak.

Mouthfeel: Full and rich, as one would want from a stout.

Overall: Had I heard no hype about this beer going in, Id have thought it was a solid beer, and would have rated it slightly below an ordinary, unbarreled Breakfast Stout. However, given the hype this beer receives, Im left with the question of why. Its solid, its good, and it has been matched and surpassed by many other stouts out there.

Pours dark black with a finger of coffee brown foam. 

The nose shows a lot of milk chocolate with heavy notes of bourbon, slight hints of peat, and a good round off with vanilla (more vanilla coke imo). 

The palate is very smooth and surprisingly light bodied (like most of their breakfast stouts). Slight alcohol bite in the middle, but dominant flavors of chocolate milk (most likely due to a moderate lactose sweetness and vanillin from the bourbon barrels), a very clean espresso finish & bitterness. A smoke background throughout the whole beer. All flavors are very balanced and somewhat delicate yet robust.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

3448,"2014-12-25",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2017 For the 100th American beer rating I put on this site, it being Christmas anyway and the weather forecast spelling icy days and nights to come, I decided to treat myself to something special. This is Founders Breakfast Stout, a delightful stout I tasted some years ago, in a special luxury edition, i.e. matured on bourbon barrels in a cave for one year. Very curious to taste this, considering its impressive score on this website.  I serve it at near room temperature in an old-fashioned snifter glass used for brandy in the old days.  Pours an initially totally opaque ink black, yet warm chestnut brown on the edges, with thick consistency, under a moussy, very dense (consisting of minuscule bubbles almost invisible to the naked eye) and deep creamy brown head leaving firm lacing on the edge of the glass and remaining closed for a long time in spite of the high ABV; after a while, it does break open, but leaves a thin greyish veil over most of the beers surface. The aroma is rich, dense and beguiling in every way: the deep, dark chocolate sauce youll find on your dame blanche in any good restaurant, Belgian chocolates, high quality coffee beans or espresso, vanilla beans all over the place, bourbon, cognac, candied dates, cherries and oranges, roasted peanuts, mandarine liqueur, liquorice, oaky tannins, crème au beurre, overripe papaja, cinnamon, cloves, cured meat and leather.  Im in beer heaven. The taste is just as intense and impressive as the aroma: a densely packed bonbon of candied fruit flavours, sweet cherries, refined coffee, the finest fondant chocolate and an ever so subtle sourish hint just to take the pressure off a bit only constitute the first sip. Then, a profound maltiness unfolds, intensely chocolatey, nutty, deep and full, with a thick, viscous, fat mouthfeel; coffee and vanilla hints are dancing graciously on top of this. A tinge of alcohol appears in the back, pointed and refined, as in a good liqueur or cognac; it brings a truly enchanting warmth and makes the head light in instants. Citrus and peppery hop notes are here for balance - and balance is what this brew achieves to utter perfection. Woodiness, indeed some bourbon, a mouth-filling roasted coffee bitterness, black pepper-like yet gentle hop bitterness and most of all, an absolutely delicious chocolate sweetness remain after youve swallowed, warming the throat and leaving you flabbergastered. This kind of beers inspire me, this is why I became a beer fanatic. This is not beer, this is liquid gastronomy taken to the highest level, one could write pages of poetry about a beverage this perfect. A rare treat - and that is exactly how it should be. The best stout I ever tasted, at least to this point. Deep respect for the guys at Founders who crafted this!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3448,"2014-11-13",4.0,"Bottles from Greg, thank you very much! 

Pours an oily, almost complete black color, with nearly no head.

The nose is defined by creamy chocolate aromas, with loads of bitter ground coffee, accompanied by a wooden bourbon note, very well integrated into the body of the beer.

Begins with toffeish malts and a pungent bourbon bite , followed by a gentle wooden note and a supportive coffee infusion, accompanied by smooth, creamy milk chocolate. Vanilla provides a delicate peak to the foundation of the beer, which gets perfectly along with the sweeter, toffeish part of the brew, while also calming the alcohol burn. The coffee falls off soon, as we paired the 14 version next to the 12, developing in a very pleasant way above the sweeter notes, followed by a hint of Bourbon. The older version, while missing the coffee, blends the different flavor directions more carefully, adding many layers, which are related to each other to the taste, also the Bourbon is more recognizable. Finishes with wooden, sweeter malts, still extremely smooth on the palate, while the recent version adds a slick, well integrated coffee bitterness, among a sharp boozy echo.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3448,"2014-10-05",4.0,"12oz bottles (2013 vintage I believe), courtesy of Chicago tasting crew. -  Medium-thick motor oil with a fickle espresso cap. Dense, pungent aromatics of bourbon wood, with rummy alcohol waft overtones, burnt sugar, condensed chocolate syrup and tobacco.

Mon Cheri and bourbon vanilla, dry wood show up at second sip. Thick, unctuous. tongue-coating mouthfeel with a dry laryngeal finish, the hidden place where those 70 IBUs finally surface. Also the Starbucks triple shot espresso linger for ever...if this is your night cap, youm even take it to bed after having brushed your teeth. - Obviously delicious, although very dense and missing the breathy elegance and chocolate mousse levity that a yeast profile would impart: instead all flavour pockets seem smothered, plastered with thick, syrupy layers of chocolate and coffee.

The surface is a thick, soapy layer that retains well, leaving ample coverage by the end of the drink and also leaving a dense, full-sheet coating of lace along the glass. It?s highly sweet with a medium high bitter. The syrup slick texture has a full malty sweet body to it with an abundant, but very soft, soapy carbonation. It?s a very clean, with tones of dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla and secondary notes of caramel, nuts, and even mint. The finish is chocolate mint with a hint of juicy citrus.

3448,"2014-08-10",4.6,"Transfer from BA review on 10-14-12 with slight modification after pouring from bottle and trying again-
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a black colored brew with only a tiny off white head which faded very fast to leave some patchy spots of lace on the sides of the glass as well as some small islands of foam floating on the top of the brew.

 Smell  The aroma was lighter then I was initially expecting. It had nice notes of coffee, dark chocolate, some vanilla sweetness and a nice boozy bourbon aroma. While it was light it was quite nice and warming in smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with roasted malt and coffee flavors. Some sweet vanilla and dark chocolate are up front and grow stronger toward the middle. While these flavors grow stronger, some lighter bourbon flavors come to the tongue. While the bourbon starts out lighter, by the end it really picks up in intensity with the chocolate and caramel lessening some in the profile. Along with the boozy flavor increasing in intensity, so too does some of the coffee flavors, which in the end, when combined with roasted malt flavors creates a quite roasty and pleasantly bitter boozy taste on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on the creamier side with a carbonation level that is below average. Both the lower carbonation and thicker-creamier body are fantastic for the brew and really accentuating the roasted, coffee, and bourbon flavors of the brew.

 Overall - A very tasty beer and one that is well worth a try. While it is fantastic with its wonderful roasty and bourbon flavors its reputation precedes it some. I actually think Founders Breakfast is more balanced then the Kentucky. While with this said however, the Kentucky is definitely a beer to try if you have the chance.","","Darkmagus82"

Maybe the vanilla is a bit too strong, but that may be the only slight imbalance. Best Imperial stout I have had.  EDIT: 2015 version I would have rated closer to a 4. Not as smooth with not as much body, definitely not the perfect stout like past years. Weyerbacher Sunday Morning Stout I had after 2015 KBS was better, but weyerbacher SMS was quite good.  EDIT: 2016  Dominated by dry cocoa nibs and coffee aroma.  Some bourbon in taste but not a ton.  Balanced but maybe a bit bitter.  I remember much more malt and body in 2014.  Alcohol is well masked and this is mostly balanced and still a very nice imperial stout, but not mind blowing.  With 2015 and 2016 a bit more ""normal"" I am dropping my rating from 4.3 to 4.1.  I think CBS and Big Luscious are a step above KBS now. EDIT: 2017 coffee, bourbon, vanilla roasted malt aroma and flavor. Finish is bitter coffee and almost dry for the amount of malt.

3448,"2014-04-30",4.2,"Been sitting on this one for a few weeks waiting for a good time to open it. This is my first KBS, but Ive promised myself to be as subjective as possible. 

Dark Cola pour with a very thin, almost non existent head. Nothing but a tiny ring of tan bubbles floating around the edges. Aroma is cocoa nibs, vanilla bean ice cream, coffee (not bitter coffee like Im used to smelling in these big stouts though) and the undeniable presence of bourbon. Not in an overpowering alcohol way though, just the sweet bourbon aroma. Roasted malts and burnt chocolate start to come through a bit as the beer warms up. This beer smells pretty damn good. More so than I was expecting actually. Its not super pungent and in your face, but a mellow complexity that gets better the longer the beer sits in the glass. Flavor is a little more intense than the aroma. Bitter chocolate and coffee envelop your palate, followed by some nice roasted characteristics, vanilla, and bourbon. Warms your body like a shot of whiskey. Very drinkable despite the 11.2% abv. You know the alcohol is there though, dont get me wrong. Its just not abrasive like some barrel aged stouts Ive had in the past. This beer is delicious and begs to be sipped and enjoyed. The flavors continue to develop as the beer warms and each sips reveals something a little bit different. Overall this is an excellent beer and worthy of recognition. That being said, Im not sure its worth the trouble it is to track this thing down. Multiple phone calls and trips to multiple stores before finally grabbing the last two bottles at a shop a couple towns over. I wont bend over backwards to find this one again, but Im glad I got to experience it. Truly one of the ""must try"" beers in America.","Georgia, USA","dunn4040"

Ok so at first this thing smelled like oxidized and burnt coffee and tasted pretty oxidized too and I cant verify how old my bottle was. I was honestly pretty turned off by it at first. Burnt, stale, bitter coffee, old wood, cereal grains and cocoa powder. As it warmed up however, I started to enjoy it more- deeper chocolate notes, vanilla cream, not a lot of heat on it anymore. The coffee warms up very nicely too as this beer opened up. Very glad I got to try this and I want to try another again, maybe fresher. Best imperial Stout? No. Second best? No. Overrated?

The bourbon is almost imperceptible at fridge temperature but theres still a lot of chocolate and vanilla. At room temperature, the bourbon is much more in-your-face. Smooth, bubbly, frothy, heavy mouthfeel is big but somehow not massive; sticky. Really very good, but Id be hard-pressed to make tons of special trips to get this for myself in future years. Over-hyped and the trade potential is the only thing that justifies the hunt for this.

Walking into a store 5 minutes after its official release and the one case is already sold out.  A young kid and his girlfriend appearing heartbroken that they were on the special email list and still too late 15 minutes after release.

3448,"2014-04-04",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 17, 2014 First impressions are the sweetness, alcohol, coffee and bourbon. Molasses. Vanilla. Just slight touches of tar, tobacco.

Interesting soft vanilla mouth feel. Body is just a bit light for a bourbon-barrel imperial stout.

Not as ""Roasted"" as some Imperial Stouts. 

An excellent beer, though Id rate it a bit below the RB average. A bit too dominated by the alcohol and bourbon. Would like to taste a bit more of the dried fruits.

3448,"2014-04-03",4.3,"12 oz bottle from CT Beverage in New Britain, CT.  This beer is very elusive a one to a customer limit.  Pour is jet black with motor oil thickness, a thin beige head and big alcohol legs.  Smell is equal parts dark chocolate and espresso with notes of wood, charcoal and booze.  Taste is similar to the nose with some nice elements of vanilla and oak with a charred bitterness that works well with the sweet malt.  Bourbon really shines through on the back end and actually cleanses the palate in between sips.  The barrel aging really helped this beer and us a big improvement over the Breakfast stout which I thought was a coffee saturated overrated mess.  The bourbon, oak and vanilla really make this complex and enjoyable and the coffee, although present, doesn't dominate the beer.  Love to have an aged version of this but I'm not sure if I'll get my hands on another one.","Newington, Connecticut, USA","warhawk91"

Bourbon aroma, but one of the tamest & smoothest Ive encountered. Warming notes of wood, toasted nuttiness, coffee beans, borderline bitter roast, & a decadent undercurrent of malty sweetness, a la coffee cream & sugar... Brown sugar, to be exact. Warmth brings out an enormous dark fudge character; bittersweet, savory, dense. Taste is incredibly smooth, just like the aroma would indicate. Notes of syrupy bourbon, hinting at maple, wet oak, promising vanilla, roasted maltiness, & rich, dark fudge cake. Finish of bittersweet chocolate morsels, tame bourbon, wood, nuts, & mild coffee. Very nice mouth feel... It isnt the best stout Ive ever had, not by any means - but its still amazing & fairly deserving of the hype it gets.
[Bottle / 2010 / 3 years old] Surprisingly more bourbon flavor in the three year old bottle, yet its even more smooth & void of any real burn (or warmth at all) which makes it slide down like nothing.

The appearance has a dark brown/almost black colored body, tan foamy head as it rises and falls slowly but nicely enough to leave some nice clingy slightly foamy lacing in the wake. The smell has some bourbon up front with coffee, chocolate and oak coming through to try and combine with the bourbon but still stays secondary, vanilla only comes out as it warms. The taste is slightly sweet, but burnt/roasty/smokiness of sorts goin on, vanilla comes out again but subdued, hmmm...yes a bourbon aftertaste and finish. On the palate, its pretty heavy, yet smooth and rich, not sessionable (nowhere close, not sure why I had two of these tonight, but I know Im goin to bed after this), boy oh boy that ABV is felt [the heat is there], carbonation is adequate. Overall, this is smooth, wow, what a nice mouthfeel, I can see why so many people absolutely love this, and it has so many complexities, however, almost think I need to have one more and let it age just a bit just to see how it does, other than that, this is one Id have again, and is definitely worth the hype.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

This one pours black as ever, with a good etched tan surface. Up in the nose: cocoa, so much chocolate this year, its insane....and I dig it. Coffee comes through in the secondary, and then the vanilla bourbon notes come through. I gotta say, nosewise, that this is beautiful, but no longer worth the trouble on the nose aspect vs. FBS for me. Flavor, vanilla, bourbon and american oak up front, upon moving to the posterior lingual aspects, I get an alcohol burn and some nice cocoa, but really more bourbon character - okay, this is way better than FBS, but still, in the current trade market, not quite $ worth it for me vs. Abyss. Smooth, but a bit hollow with a litter higher carb than Id prefer in this style. All around great brew, worth at least two or three tries. Really admire everything Founders does. 4/3.5/4.5/3/4-

Poured to NB Globe at around 50F
A: Deep, dark, black ale with opacity which it seems difficult to overcome. No light, not even at the edge of the beer. No carbonation evident, just black, thick beer. When agitated, can get a small appearance to provide evidence of carbonation.
A2: Same as above. Add thick quilt of dark mocha head which hangs around. Little lacing.
S: Coffee, dark chocolate, hints of bourbon, good and sweet vanilla tones intertwine with plenty of malt goodness. This develops over the course of the beer and further accentuates the the chocolate tones.
S2: Coffee again. You know, the bourbon is just not here, too much coffee! 
T: Wow. Its the most chocolate Ive ever experienced in a beer. Dark, +85% pure, but chocolate nonetheless. I almost want this beer to be served warm, oddly. So much coffee continues to highlight this beer, and I cant think but wonder how they did this. Just delightful. Just a hint spicy and hot with the alcohol. 
T2: More coffee this time around. Still no bourbon. Why dont they just skip the barrel? Lakes and East Coast seem to be obsessed with coffee beer. okay, okay, theres bourbon on the back end, but not substantial. Okay beer, not as good as the homers make out.
M: Heavy, thick, sticky. Dries the tongue, dries my life. Sucks me dry and compels me to fill my mouth with more of the seductive beer. Low carbonation. Well played.
M2: see above.
O: This beer is good, no doubt. My problem is with the bal presence. Heres the thing, if you want to have a coffee beer, have a coffee beer. If you want to have a BBA beer, have a BBA beer. If you want to have a BBA/coffee beer, learn to balance them. I cant say I will pursue this as aggressively next year. Its just not that great. Good yes.

A: Big nose full of roasty malts, subtle vanilla dark chocolate notes, roasted coffee and bourbon (booze). 
A: Blackest of night with the tannest of tan heads of about a finger and a half thick. VERY SEXY!
T: Dark chocolate notes initially that give way to some espresso/coffee notes with the bourbon becoming more evident in the finish. Aftertaste has a balance between the bourbon and the coffee flavors with the bourbon dominating more as it warms.
P: Creamy, chewy and silky with a nice low carbonation. Surprisingly very smooth for a beer that is 11.2%!
O: Outstanding beer. WORLD CLASS! Very complex. Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon are the primary flavors, as advertised to be. VERY, VERY RARELY does a beer truly live up to the hype, this is that rare example.","New Jersey, USA","ClassyBeagle"

Strong, yet not overbearing notes of bourbon, vanilla, and oak come into the picture and meld with the now stronger notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The bourbon, oak, and vanilla get stronger as it warms; yet it does not get hot at all. It simply makes the beer more complex and flavorful. Surprisingly thin for a beer of this magnitude.

Full bodied with fine carbonation pitched at just the right level to make this double digit ABVer eminently drinkable. Sweetish boozey finish where the bourbon really comes through.

3448,"2013-04-14",4.7,"I had such a desire to try this beer so I was a little worried that the anticipation would cloud my judgment. Keeping that in mind, as I shared this brew with a buddy, I poured the bottle into two glasses. Very dark, almost opaque, with a a very nice head. Bourbon takes the front stage in the nose and is followed by a subtle coffee scent. The taste is amazing with coffee on the front and bourbon on the back end. The bourbon is like drinking some of the best you have ever had. Oh I wish I had a cigar while drinking this beer. No further description is needed other than to say this beer is amazing.

Medium-low carbonation. Creamy, full-bodied mouth feel. Founders doesnt mislead; this is coffee and bourbon, a breakfast stout aged in bourbon barrels.

You then get a chocolate covered coffee bean flavor and only a touch of bitterness.  Finishes with more chocolate and a bit of oak woodiness.

The beer pours basically a black color with a good sized head & lots of lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is sort of a pleasant amalgamation of espresso and bourbon... you can tell that its boozy from the aroma but its not off putting or ""cheap-vodka""-like... The aroma is very roasty & rich with some nice vanilla. 

The flavor is very bourbon forward, I drank this glass pretty much at room temperature and its far more bourbony than when its just straight cold. The beer is sweet but not ""dessert sweet"" ala Bourbon County Stout. Unsurprisingly its a big roasty beer with a nice level of bitter chocolate, the vanilla is mild but pleasant, there is some green pepper character but not enough to be an annoyance, the coffee character all around comes across as a touch brash and there is a pretty high level of alcohol spiciness. 

The beer sits heavy on the tongue but avoids any ""syrupy"" character.

Aroma: This thing smells great.  Its very intense.  Theres some deep espresso aroma, some bitter chocolate, theres a touch of bourbon all accented with a creamy sweet note.  Theres a little touch of vanilla and possibly some nut (maybe hazelnut?).  The alcohol is apparent, but not to the point of being boozy.

Taste: I had a serious beergasm when I took my first sip.  Its so intense, with so many flavors going on.  The bourbon barrel aging is apparent as there is a definite touch of the wood from the barrel and a touch of actual bourbon flavor.  Theres big espresso and deep chocolate notes that dominate the palate and those are accompanied by vanilla and caramel.

Mouthfeel: Decadent.  Luscious.  Wonderful.  

Overall: I was surprised at how much the coffee didnt smack me in the face as much as the regular breakfast stout, but thats ok.

Taste is dark chocolate up front, followed by hearty coffee, all tied together with the oak and bourbon flavor that takes turns and dances with the other flavors. Relatively thin, yet very smooth mouth feel. When one flavor subsides, the other comes forward. Beautiful balance. Beautiful beer.","Buffalo, New York, USA","Miked1687"

3448,"2013-03-30",4.1,"2013 bottle picked up at the brewery today. Pours black as night with no head. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, slight alcohol, maybe some hops and chocolate. Taste matches aroma. Mouthfeel is medium. Alcohol is fairly well hidden. This is the first time I have tried KBS. To me, it is very similar to Bourbon County Stout, but slightly thinner with less noticeable alcohol. Very good......I will put the other bottles away and see how they age.

Aroma: Big bourbon upfront. As you begin to sip, the chocolates and coffee make their way in.

Appearance: Dark brown pour, quickly diminishing medium-brown head. Fine lacing ring on sides with spotty lacing throughout. Nice oily coating on glass.

Taste: Again, big bourbon. A very nice chocolate body balances the nose. Hints of roasted malts over the middle. And yet another big dose of bourbon in the finish that is complimented with notes of coffee.

Palate: medium-heavy body, little carbonation. A meal.

3448,"2013-02-25",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2013 2011 bottle (year and a halfish).  Whaddaya want me to say?  It smells awesome - very mellow bourbon on a smooth coffee-touch-of-cream back-bone,  And theres a skull on the label.  Small and classy, of course, but its a skull.  Im rambling.  This is the bourbon-barreled version of what may be the standard Midwest stout.  And, as you may expect, it fucking rocks. So well balanced - coffee, smoke, wood, bourbon, and roast wonderfully meshed.  

ADDTN: Drinking a fresh 2013 bottle: rated as a 4.6  (Ill leave the higher rating up).  Astrigent chocolate on the aroma.  Rich and intriguing.  Mouthfeel is much more harsh when younger.

3448,"2013-02-21",4.5,"12 oz. bottle got in a trade with Adam Jackson. Bottled on 2/17/2012. Just past a year sitting and is almost perfect in every aspect. Superb.

Old strong coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla with a touch of bourbon. Lingering light flavors of oaky bourbon and coffee hints. A slight warming sensation after the sip. ABV is only noticed after the sip, no alcohol flavor. My favorite thing here is the bourbon has mellowed out and really melds well with the stout.

Appearance: Pours a motor oil black with a tiny, bubbly dark mocha brown head which dissipates quickly leaving a ring around the edge of the snifter. Excellent lacing.

Smell: Dark roasted coffee, milk chocolate, oak, vanilla and a slight hint of alcohol. Smells excellent.

Taste: Dark roasted malt with a nice amount of sweet chocolate up front followed by molasses, vanilla and before ending with oak, bourbon and a touch of black pepper at the finish. Aftertaste is coffee with a touch of sweetness. The alcohol is hidden very well in the background behind the robust and complex flavor profile. 

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and thick with just the right amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This one is ridiculously smooth for a beer with 11.2% ABV. It could definitely sneak up on you.

Overall: Incredible beer overall. Rarely does a beer live up to this kind of hype, but KBS absolutely is worth all the acclaim. I cant recommend this beer enough.

Coffee becomes more pronounced with warmth.  Very dark roast espresso like.  Expected more in the nose.  I expected a much richer, sweeter flavor from this but was instead surprised to find that where this beer excels is instead in its incredible balance.

Through the middle, the oak and Bourbon come through with roasted coffee and molasses and some earthy hops. The finish is a mix of roasted milk chocolate, coffee, oak, vanilla, Bourbon, and some booze.

M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a sweet, roasted, bitter, and warming finish.

2011 Bottle

Aroma: A nose of roasted malts, chocolate, bourbon/wood, a little soy sauce, and a little coffee

Appearance: This one pours a dark brown-black color, with a small beige head, and spotty lace

Flavor: This one tastes medium sweet, it is a little bozzy, and has minimal bitterness

Palate: The body is medium, it has a smooth, creamy feel, and a soft carbonation

Overall Impression: 
Excellent beer that I have enjoyed before and needed to rate.  I thought the 2011 held up pretty well, though theres basically no hop left to speak of. 2011 Bottle Rating: (8/4/8/5/16)

2012 Bottle


Aroma: The nose is roasted like the 2011, more bourbon, more booze, and a little more hop

Appearance: The pour is pretty much exactly the same as the pour from the 2011 Bottle

Flavor: The taste, like the nose,has the same roast component with more booze, and a later hop presence

Palate: The body is very similar to the 2011, though theres a touch more carbonation

Overall Impression: 
The 2012 is a little better in my opinion.  The hops add a nice component that was missing in the older bottle.  Justin and I agreed, that this one is better fresher.  2012 Bottle Rating: (8/4/9/5/17)","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
3448,"2012-10-15",3.8,"Sampled at GABF 12. Pour is pitch black in appearance with a moderately sized dark brown head and good lacing. Huge coffee in the aroma, roasted chocolate, espresso, light biscuit, malty, sweet bourbon, and a touch of vanilla. Taste is again big coffee, earthy roasted notes, cocoa nibs, wood, and bourbon. Thick mouthfeel with soft carbonation. The overroasted coffee taste, is a bit overbearing and gives chili-like off-flavors; something is a little off. Still a delicious beer,  but it misses out on exceptional because I cant get past that chili flavor.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"

3448,"2012-10-08",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2014 Pours motor oil like with no head. Smells of heavy chocolate, vanilla, licorice, wood, bourbon and boozey.

Tried a 2011 bottle on Dec 20, 2012. Same impression as before, like the regular FBS better, but this one is a nice warming yumminess. Only complait is theres no more coffee flavor. Just sort of bourbony, and slightly metallic but nothing serious.

2013 bottle pretty fresh on 5/3/13. This one seems thicker than before with a little more vanilla. Bourbon is still a little harsh and there are others of the stule I prefer. Still a neat beer though.

Poured into my Founder Snifter glass (Im tacky like that)

A: Poured very thick, like a deep black cream. 1 finger brown head leaving a nice ring lace around the glass.

S: The smells that immediately hit my nose are incredible. Coffee grinds with an incredible malt backbone. Bitter chocolate with a slight bourbon smell on the very end.

T: Ive never tasted anything like this. A light creamy vanilla with a roast coffee back. Smooth malts and milk chocolates finishing with a nice sweet bourbon and light woody taste.

M: Heavy bodied with an amazing lingering mouthfeel. Slight carbonation with a nice oily film that leaves an amazing subtle coffee with vanilla taste. Coats the palate with precision.

O: WOW! This was my first KBS and it didnt last long. This is by far the best beer Ive ever had. The complexities of this beer are outstanding: the roasted malts, bitter coffee, sweet chocolates and vanilla, finished out with the wonderful hints of bourbon and the oak make this an incredible beer. I hope every BA gets a chance to try this beauty at least once.

3448,"2012-09-17",3.8,"While I feel it suffers greatly in the bottle, this has one of the most amazing array of aromas wafting from its dense black body. Sweet (seemingly warm) chocolates, vanilla liquor, bourbon, hunts of sweet apples or, even, apple pie.  Thick and rich and opulent, the heavy body sticks to your ribs as much as it does the sides of your mouth. I am quite put off by the upfront bourbon presented during first few swallows (especially present in recent bottles) but I get used to it as the massive chocolates burst through. A bit fiery in the alcohol department noted at the finish in last few I have had, leading to a less enjoyable experience.  Always hard to find, but worth a try.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"

3448,"2012-07-27",4.3,"My 1000th rating, care of Mr Paul Unwin. I was a bit hesitant about going for the KBS. Was not a fan of Bourbon County Stout. Opened this and looked into the neck of the bottle to see the swirling smokey aroma released. One sniff and it was pure dark chocolate. A very good start. Next sniff and theres a strong whiff of bourbon whiskey barrel. That grainy smokey sweetness. Hope its not going to overwhelm the flavours. So, smokey oak barrel, bourbon whiskey, dark chocolate, expresso coffee, spice, minerally. Colour is opaque black, thin tan head. Theres some carbonation bubbles in there but not too much. Taste is a surprise. Really well balanced. Big hit of dark chocolate, black coffee and some sweet bourbon whiskey, but its not overwhelming. Theres some carbonation, which tingles with the bourbon flavour, but as it goes down its smooth dark choc and black coffee. Perfect balance. Watching Danny Boyles Olympics Opening Ceremony.

3448,"2012-06-20",4.0,"Very good Bourbon Stout. Aroma is very strong, with the obvious bourbon not veorpowering a strong chocolate presence but the coffee aroma seems to be out of balance IMHO. The appearance is what Im looking for in this style - black, smooth and slightly viscous appearance. Almost non-existent head on mine, but second poor did have about a one inch head that quickly dissipated - chalk that up to server inconsistency rather than the beer. The lacing was next to nil, which again Im fine with. Mouthfeel was wonderful - smooth, almost coating your mouth. Taste was pretty good, but seemed, as with the aroma, imbalanced with overly strong coffee flavor up front.

3448,"2012-06-07",4.2,"Thanks to javit for the bottle. This baby is my breakfast on vacation. Body is a thick, viscous, motor oil black. An aggressive pour only produced a coffee colored head about a 1/2 finger which quickly fades to a thick collar. Collar has perfect retention. No lacing is left behind in the glass. Nose is complex and balanced. Vanilla, oak, and sweet bourbon come through first in the nose with a big roasted chocolate backbone. The bourbon really assets itself. There is also more than a hint of alcohol. In the taste is vanilla, an essence of sweet bourbon, chocolate, oak, and some roasted flavors. Tastes like a roasted coffee upfront. The finish is a huge blast of roasted malt flavors and bourbon heat. Left to linger is alcohol astringency and heat, roasted malt flavors and bitterness, and a hint of vanilla and oak. Medium tingly carbonation and a body that is balanced with thick stout qualities and alcohol. Better than decent, but a little thinner than I like. This is a decent stout, and one I have been looking for. It was an honor to try it and if I see it around I will pick it up and age it, but its a little too hot with alcohol for my tastes.

Bottle from a trade  thanks Jason!
Aroma has strong coffee notes, some licorice and bourbon. Smooth palate. Flavour starts with coffee and goes through strong whisky notes, passes the licorice valley with touch of salt and ends up with woody aftertaste with bourbon. And warms my throat afterwards. Still delicious! At the end of the glass the coffee steps a bit aside and bourbon tones take over.

Personally, I really enjoyed it, but Im pretty sure its NOT a beer that most people would expect and be happy to drink past the first sip.  It definitely has one foot past the line of what does and does not taste like beer.  Instead tastes more like a southerners dessert liquor.  It would have been nice to see the other flavors come out more, rather than sitting in the bourbons shadow.  Next time Ill age it the full year and see what happens.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

3448,"2012-04-25",4.4,"120z bottle with Bottled on 2/17/12 stamped on the neck.

APPEARANCE:  Poured motor oil black out of the bottle and into my Founders Snifter.  Head is chocolate brown in color and stood just under a finger tall following a medium-aggressive pour.  It settled within a couple of minutes and is now a thin a spotty layer with minimal head retention (youll often find that this is the case with beers that are this high in alcohol).  I just held this up to a pretty bright light, and its black as night with no brown-ish hues to speak of.

AROMA:  Bourbon, wood, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, & campfire coals.

TASTE:  Im getting a bit of char and roasted flavor  up front.  Bourbon and woody flavors arent far behind.  Theres a chocolaty sweetness that surfaces about midway.  Coffee beans and hops provide some bitterness towards the back-end to help balance things out.  Finish is filled with the fore-mentioned flavors accompanied by some heat from the alcohol.

MOUTHFEEL:  Medium-full body with low carbonation and big-time flavor.

MOREYS BOTTOM LINE:  A REALLY good barrel-aged beer.  Its got a little bit of everything, and you can actually pick out the individual components.  The bourbon is present, but it doesnt completely overtake the chocolate and the coffee.  Its sweet, its bitter, its roasty, its woody.I mean, whats not to like!","Erie, Pennsylvania, USA","Morey"
3448,"2012-04-24",4.0,"Originally reviewed: 5/25/09. Finally getting to the KBS. Pours a very thick oily black with absolutely no head, no bubbles, no lace, nothing. This just looks like dirty motor oil in a glass. Nose is full of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, almonds, and bread. 

Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Great viscous mouth that is easy to sip. I waited awhile after pouring to drink this. At first I was tasting huge coffee flavor that finished slightly boozy, but as it warmed and I continued to drink, I was getting more vanilla and a faint nutty finish. Drinkability is low for me as it took about an hour to finish this one, and I could never have another right away.

I drink this beer as the ceremonial 4000th rating, but also to celebrate an anniversary. The beer pours black-brown with a sturdy, creamy and tight beige foam head. Lots to take in on the nose. Dry coffee hits first, followed by oak chips, dark cocoa, alcohol, mild roast, a bit of tobacco and earth. Great flavor, very rich, very sweet. Lots of charred malts, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate cake, oak and straight burnt wood, some mild earthy bitterness. Full bodied, lightly chewy with fine carbonation. Warm finish with lots of dark sugars, licorice, molasses, dark chocolate, light coffee, mocha, vanilla, chocolate syrup, light peat, burnt grass, burnt wood. Certainly lives up to the hype. Its a robust, nicely nuanced beer with plenty of punch. I love it. A great way to commemorate this happy day. (April 2012, score: 4.5)Bottle at home in London, on a Sunday in late August. This bottle is the most recent vintage. Pours thick, oily black with a frothy khaki head that subsides a little faster than you might expect. The aroma has hearty chocolate, dense roast, baking cocoa, burnt toffee, fresh coffee. Big sweet flavor, a little sticky, with rich and gooey chocolate, bittersweet coffee, some caramel undertones, alcohol. Full bodied, lightly chewy, with fine carbonation and velvety texture. Warming, almost hot finish, with more sticky dark malts, rich chocolate, scorched earth, faint woody dryness, charred caramel, dark fruits, raisins, lightly bitter coffee. Great stuff overall.

3448,"2012-04-21",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2015 2012 bottle poured into snifter.  Ive been waiting a while to try this.  Blackest of black pours with no head.  Great lacing on the glass.  Huge chocolate and vanilla aroma along with bourbon and coffee.  Amazing.  Bourbon hits immediately at first .  When that mellows the taste is more chocolatety and roasted malt.  Still taste vanilla and even some dark fruit seems to come through.  Some alcohol burn on the finish.  Bourbon taste lingers for a very long time.  Delicious.  Will save the other 3 bottles and drink one each year.  I have a feeling this beer will get even better.

Update:  Decided to drink another 2012 bottle at room temperature like they recommend.  Wow.  I have a new appreciation for this beer.  Only beer I have ever thoroughly enjoyed at room temp.  Surprisingly you dont taste the bourbon as much so the chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt taste comes through more.  Almost no alcohol burn which is amazing to me.  It was probably the best beer I have ever had.  It will be hard to let my other two bottles sit a year or two.

It is powerful, yet somehow quite comforting. The taste obeys every aroma note and has a powerful, complex finish of strong roasted malts, caramel, and booze. I think the bourbon component definitely overpowered the coffee component in this one. The palate is, like that of all Founders stouts, wonderfully thick. This is a sipper, if there ever was one, although I could sit and sip this stuff all day long.

3448,"2012-04-16",4.2,"A - Fairly dark, then a thick mocha head that slowly dissipates. Sticks very well, looks fantastic. S - Massive amounts of smooth coffee, slight amount of vanilla in the distance. Hints of oak around the edges. T - Roasted malt, coffee, coffee, coffee, then some barrel emerges in the finish with the coffee. The oak is present and gives a hint of dryness. Vanilla notes are the most present of the barrel flavors that come through in the end, but apparently there is already vanilla in the base so it is hard to tell. There is a lack of any real complexity for over the first half of the flavor. There is some chocolate coming through in the flavor after the first few sips. The finish is great, the coffee and barrel blend very well. I do enjoy the flavor more than I probably should. P - Medium body, lower carbonation on the tongue. O - Really a good one.

Smell:  Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, cherry, rich caramel malt and a slight alcohol sent.  

Palate:  Medium thick, velvety mouth feel.  The carbonation is very mild and there is very little alcohol heat.  Goes down smooth.  Almost too smooth.

Taste:  Follow the smell.  Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, cherry and rich caramel malt.  All these flavors are perfectly balanced.  The big alcohol in this beer is completely masked.  

Overall:  EXCELLENT example of the Imperial Stout Barrel aged style.  I will drink this any time I can get it.  Just wish it were more available.  As for the KBS haters, if you dont like Imperial Stouts dont drink them or rate them.

3448,"2012-03-25",1.8,"I write this review with apprehension, once again I am faced with a brew, on tap, that is beloved by so m any of my peers. Many, to my chagrin, jump on the bandwagon and say they love this stuff, reminiscent of expedition stout. To start, I am not a fan of impy stouts so when I first saw this, I thought to pass it by. However, how many times do you see the notorious KBS on tap?  For awhile, I never even knew what KBS was, heheh, even tho everybody on my local blog spout on and on about it! KBS this and KBS that and KBS is on tap here and there; wtf is KBS I thought to myself? BS where I come from stands for...well...you know. So, I figured I better try this before it was gone and at $12 per 8 oz glass, everybody around me was gobbling this up and it looked like it would not be there for long. Keep in mind, I rate beers by how much I like them, so take my rating with a grain of salt. Out of the tap this stuff was big and black with a thin chocolate moose head, heheh. Smell is like refined volatile stout, as many impy stouts smell. First taste is big alky laced coffee but I must admit, the alky portion is not as harsh or rude as I thought it would be but there it is, big whiskey alky thing. Perhaps this separates it from the standard BS. Bitter strong nasty and over the top; terribly on impy stout style. Difficult example of a beer, yet not unrefined. Not sure what my peers see in this brew, it sometimes almost invokes a gag reflex. Sweet and nearly cloying backbone. Big long rude bitter finish makes this a beer to be reckoned with.  Did not find much difference between this, except the whiskey thing,  and any other of the founders breakfast stouts Ive tasted. Certainly not worth the double in price. Will never drink again, way too much for the girlie taste buds of this refined lager lover. Its typical for most on this site to present accolades to most anything that is imperial stout, check out the top 50; and most of the beer experts here claim to rate by style - balderdash!","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

3448,"2012-03-22",4.5,"My first experience with this ale was at DLD 2010, early in the day.  It was among the six guest tap brews my two buddies and I shared after the gates opened.  It was ethereal, especially since it was only $5 a pint.  My second sampling of this stout was from a bottle of the 2010 version, which I cellared until Super Bowl Sunday of 2011.  It did not live up to the draft version I had the previous April, and I was rather dismayed at having dropped $7 for the bottle.  So dismayed, that I did not pursue any 2011 KBS.  Not having it last year and reading about its planned release this year rekindled my fire that had burned for this brew after my DLD experience.  My 2012 bottle has restored my fondness, and made me want for more.  Keep in mind that I am drinking this on the third day of spring in northwest Indiana, which would typically be weather appropriate.  However, it was over eighty degrees this afternoon and lingers near seventy this evening.  Not ideal BA stout sipping conditions, but KBS was heat proof.

The aroma was predominantly chocolate, roasted coffee, resin (yes, that kind), and vanilla (yum) with slight floral notes and traces of alcohol and  woodiness.  I did pour it aggressively into my seventeen ounce snifter, which produced a short lived brown head.  It is as deep as brown can get without being black.  The taste validates the aromas, beginning sweetly with slight balancing bitterness followed by a tingly alcohol burn.  Its body is medium, with a sticky texture, very soft carbonation, and a long finish.  If only this were more readily available at a more modest price point!  This is a must try beer if you have a chance, just give your self at least an hour to savor every sip without many distractions.  It warrants that type of reverence.","Saint John, Indiana, USA","HoppyAlesToYou"

3448,"2012-03-20",4.0,"Bottled on 2/17/2012. 12 oz bottle into a brandy snifter. Excited to finally review this beer. I had a fresh bottle last year while I was sick and not into bourbon, so it was a bit of a mess...

A - Pitch black with some very light mocha edging which eventually disappears completely. A vigorous swirl simply produces more edging with tiny amounts of lacing. Has some sticky alcohol legs though.

S - Strong fresh coffee notes followed by some milk chocolate, oak, faint vanilla and a touch of alcohol. As it warms up the bourbon becomes more pronounced. The coffee is just so prominent and dominant here, and this is some damn good coffee beans were talking about here.

T - Bitter coffee followed by some bittersweet chocolate and bourbon notes. Oak, vanilla and butterscotch. This is a beer for bourbon lovers. Its amazing how it starts off with dominant coffee and leads right into a fine bourbon. The finish is boozy and bittersweet. 70 IBUs? Holy hell!

M - I dont know how I feel about the mouth feel. Its medium with an average level of carbonation. As a stout lover I feel like it could be thicker and chewier. As a bourbon lover I think it works really well. The finish is warm yet pleasant.

O - I adore BCBCS because its blends the fresh and intense notes of coffee, the roasty and sweet chocolatey notes of a stout, and the rich and buttery notes of a good bourbon to a near perfection. KBS doesnt blend all of these elements together very well. In the end its a bourbon strong coffee beer with a light body.

Completely motionless except for the milk chocolate colored ring for a head around the glass.  Taste is very full and rich in the mouth.  Black licorice, coffee, bittersweet chocolate.  The bourbon flavor is subtle but the beers alcohol warmth is definitely present.  Bittering hops peek out just long enough for you to realize they have done their job but the roast and cocoa nibs are the star of the show.

3448,"2012-03-17",4.3,"2012 Batch brewed on 2-17-2012 (1 Month Ago). Poured into a Tulip Glass at Cellar Temp (60 Degrees F)

A - Gorgeous 2-Finger coffee color head with a nice mix of creamy bubbles and big bubbles. It subsides very slowly. Youd think this beer was completely black but its actually a very dark brown as you pour it into the glass. In the glass, it looks like pitch black (not oily, just pitch). Nice glass lacing and alcohol legs on a swirl.

S - The first scent is a delicious fresh espresso with nice crema. Follow up is bourbon and oak followed by a very sweet vanilla. Its remarkable how each scent is so separate to make up this complete picture of amazing smelling beer.

T - On first sip, coffee and bourbon are what I get first. The bourbon and woodiness burns and sticks down my throat and into my chest. Like a fine whisky, the heat stays around for a while. The coffee quickly fades away to intense wood and vanilla. The heat is a bit too much for me.

M - 50/50 Bubbles to Liquid on a single mouth swish. Heavy bodied and very very astringent with huge bourbon and wood tastes. Its super heavy and intense heat.

O - Great flavors but way too much heat and a very displeasing linger of woodiness. It is still a phenomenal beer. The issue with aging this beer is the coffee goes away. I would imagine, in 12 months, this beers heat would retract a bit but the intense coffee would fade which would ruin the fantastic awesome-ness that is coffee.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3448,"2012-03-16",4.6,"2012 bottle to tulip. Pours straight black with almost no head. The bit of head on top is caramel colored. Aroma is chocolate, toffee, coffee, roasted malt and alcohol. Taste is as advertised - everything a stout should be. Bitter, coffee, some chocolate sweetness and hot bourbon on the back. Easily identified for any Kentuckian. Clearly bottled with some amount of luck - as I am drinking this, Lehigh is threatening to beat Duke in the NCAA. Bourbon power!
Moderate mouthfeel. Coffee and bourbon aftertaste. I'm gonna give the other bottles a good long rest before I try them again. 
Clearly better than the CBS IMO.

Wasnt overly impressed the first couple of times, at least in terms of the incremental expectation over regular breakfast stout. And quite frankly my impression is similar this time.

The taste shows how unique this one is.  You think of a barrel aged imperial stout and theres a pretty standard flavor profile that comes to mind - this is not that flavor profile.  Again, big charred wood, that same coffee and dark malts.  The alcohol waits until the very end to show itself as it mingles with a coppery mineral after burn.

Poured into a snifter 

A: Pours dark black that does not allow any light through even being held up to a light. About a one finger head of chocolate milk color that dissipates rather quickly (30 seconds). There is some slight lacing.

S: Smell is dominated by bourbon and oak. I also pick up on the alcohol even after a little more than a year of aging. There is also roasted coffee, sweet molasses and some dark chocolate notes.

T: The taste is again dominated by bourbon and the oak wood. The alcohol is definately present and after allowing the beer to coat my mouth, the alcohol does have some burn. After swallowing whats left is some sweet molasses. Allowing the beer to warm some there is a nice warming effect on me. 

M: The mouthfeel is rater thin for such a powerful stout. A creamy character comes to mind but surprisingly does not stick around long after swallowing.

O: To my surprise I was not as impressed as I thought I would by. Do not get me wrong, KBS is a top notch BA stout that I would love to have again, but the hype may have let me down on this one some.

3448,"2012-02-27",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 7/6/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.

KBS is pitch black in appearance, with a small brown head. Some light lace, but nothing significant sticking to the glass. After just a few moments, nothing more than a ring remains around the glass.

Chocolate and roasted malt are dominant in the nose, which is somewhat sweet. Coffee, oak, and bourbon are noticeable as well. Vanilla seems to have faded from the aroma at this point.

The sip starts out with the taste of bittersweet chocolate, dark chocolate malt, and roasted malt. Burnt sugar and molasses sweetness comes in next, some light vanilla too, and some booziness gradually seeps into the flavor. Coffee is firmly mixed with the roasted malt flavor, but does not overpower. The finish is more bitter chocolate and a little bourbon.

Extremely full bodied; nice and creamy. Carbonation is almost crowded out by the motor oil thickness.

3448,"2012-02-03",4.0,"12oz. bottle, 2011 vintage, cellar aged.  Aroma of oak, vanilla, dark chocolate and bourbon, with lighter suggestions of smoke, coffeeish, roasty, nearly burnt malts, some tobacco and very faint black cherry in the background.  Thick-looking opaque black color with a fine, persistent, tan head and very thin lacing.  Flavor profile is sweet and roasty with lightly burnt sugar, charred oak and bitter chocolate, alongside gentle tinges of bourbon, vanilla, prune and earthiness, spicy alcohol and faint soy appearing towards the finish.  Warming, lightly coating, very gently acidic mouthfeel, low-moderate effervescence, ultimately fairly dry and with a gigantic body.  The age seems to have toned down the oakiness and bourbon presence just a bit, I certainly dont believe thats a negative outcome compared to a fresh bottle.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

3448,"2012-02-02",4.3,"KBS pours a pitch black color.  Oily.  A very small tan head is formed.  Good retention on whatever head was left.

Smell on this beer is fantastic.  Bourbon is the number one thing youll notice here.  Its not overpowering by any means but its what I picked up most.  Backing up that is the lovely chocolate malt, oak, and just a hint of coffee.  Its lovely, its sorta balanced.

At first I couldnt get into the taste.  It was very sweet.   But as the beer warmed up everything came into play and was very balanced.  Dont expect a huge and overwhelming bourbon taste here but instead expect a mixture of bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, and chocolate to dance across your tongue.  This is an almost 12% stout, so there is some alcohol there but it never gets in the way.

Palate has broken down a bit from fresh KBS which pops with fresh sharp roasted coffee up front, this was mellowed out flavors across the board.  The bourbon had even faded a bit in the finish.

3448,"2012-01-25",5.0,"Tried this after a year of aging in the cellar. I cracked this last night at Uber Tavern in Seattle to share with a friend and fellow beer lover. 

I havent reviewed in awhile, and honestly, I dont even think words can do this beer justice. This is not only a beer, but an experience. It is by far the greatest bourbon barrel aged impy stout ever crafted by man (that Ive tried so far - cant imagine it getting much better than this though). Brewing is not only science, but an art form and with KBS, Founders has created the Mona Lisa of bourbon impy stouts. This stuff is ridiculously amazing. Id seriously consider donating a limb for a case of this stuff!

Truly mind blowing. A beer I will not soon forget, and one that I will now be seeking out with ravenous desire.","Seattle, Washington, USA","julian"
3448,"2012-01-22",3.6,"Served in Lost Abbey tulip. 2010 vintage. 

Appearance: Pitch black, but very little lacing. 

Smell: Caramel and vanilla from the bourbon. Brown sugar and dark chocolate dominate, but Im surprised by the lack of coffee. I suppose its because its almost 2 years old at this point. 

Taste: The nose knows. Caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate. Theres still some alcohol left over in this, and not in a pleasant way; its far too sharp. Though the sharpness dissipates some as the beer warms. However, the alcohol presence overwhelms the aforementioned flavors as I dont find them particularly strong in any aspect.

Mouthfeel: This is where the beer loses me. KBS is heavily carbonated and comes off surprisingly thin. More importantly, it feels like its keeping the flavors off my tongue. I figured with the lack of lacing and bubbles, this might have sat down a bit further in the glass.

Overall: Good, but not great. This is the second bottle Ive had and I havent been impressed either time. (I wanted to give this a second chance since I first had it when my palate was a bit less far along.) I suppose its fair to mention I dont much like FBS for the same reasons as mentioned above, and I can see how people would like both of these for their their balance. But I would search for Founders Imperial Stout instead.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Ive had this one tap and out of the bottle several times, including a seven month old bottle that I felt was notably different from from the other, fresher examples.  This is what Ill talk about.  The beer pours a very dark, viscous black color with a toasty, brownish head like the crema on a freshly pulled espresso.  The beer offers savory aromas of vanilla, oak barrel, bourbon toffee, caramel, toasted almonds, brown sugar and dark chocolate syrup.  I noticed a coffee blast much more in the aroma when the beer is fresh, however I understand that coffee is often quick to fade in aged beers brewed with coffee.   The taste now is rich chocolate, butterscotch/whisky, deep oaky malt with some meaty, fermented dark fruit, barrel and a hint of coffee.

A - Pours jet black with a nice one finger tall khaki head, dissipating down to a thin film, leaving 
S - Smells of coffee grounds, warm bourbon, light chocolate sweetness, dark roasted malts, and some dulled heat. A bit of dry oak and rubbing alcohol comes thru as it comes to room temp. Not too bad.
T - Starts off with some dark roasted coffee giving way slowly to a mix of dulled chocolaty sweetness and some dry wood tannins. Finish is a mix of dark roast and muted bourbon heat. About a year in the bottle now and it seems to have dulled the coffee and bourbon heat a bit but that is to be expected. I like the direction it is headed in.

Finish is rich, like having eaten a piece of the best home-made dark-chocolate pie (if the crust were made with bourbon) you could imagine.  Simply put:  the best beer Ive ever had.","Lebanon, New Jersey, USA","RGDave"
3448,"2011-09-24",4.5,"Black pour and brown head, thick with aggressive pour.  Lacing everywhere. Roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, notes of vanilla, and booze.  Taste is strong sweet at first sip, but the bourbon steps in to offset that, and leaves a bitter finish.  Beer is big; thick, sticky, and creamy.  Overall, this is a damn good one.  Im not a big bourbon barrel guy because most brewers make that the focal point of the beer.  But this one does not and there is just enough oakiness and booziness to make this one a favorite.","Indiana, USA","iugrad93"

3448,"2011-09-21",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2012 Bottle @ Bir & Fud bottega. Thats one of my favorite beers and maybe i wont be honest about it. Appearance: solid black color, brown foamy rocky head. Aroma. WTF... the heaven?  The balance between the Founders IRS (i got its trademark for sure) and the bourbon aging is absolutely perfect. a lot of chocolate, coffee, espresso, vanilla, cocoa beans, malt a little bit of booze. The taste is even more intense, some sweet cheese (you know mascarpone? I guess the KBS is the perfect beer for  tiramistout) and wood come in addiction to the rest. some herbal notes are slightly perceptible but the beer is quite bitter on the tongue. anyway im sure youll get the sweetness among the rest. Full body, really smooth mouth feel. 11.2abv? not a clue. youll loose money betting it had just 8/9 abv because it is incredible enjoyable regardless the boozy notes. more intense than long dry, bitter and sweet, bourbon finish. 
The beer is actually  not so complex as you might think. Anyway the result is almost perfect and it remains the benchmark for the bourbon barrel aging IMO.
Ive started being a Bourbon advocate and enthusiast lately, so i was much curios about which bourbon barrels they use for the KBS and i already wrote the response in the review. I was right, not a premium one, but smooth and sweet enough, a good choice because it never outmatches the beer. Anway other beers aged in the same kind of barrels got a totally different result.
This one remains even better than the (in)famous CBS which i had some weeks ago.","Berlin & Rome, GERMANY","INDASTRIA"

The beer finishes long and strong with the alcohol and hard coffee roast present at the end for sure.  Really drinkable in terms of weight and not to coating either.  Reminds me more of a porter than a stout of substantial heft.  Waited a while on this and tasted many along the way.

3448,"2011-08-31",4.5,"HONORARY RATING for ""The King of RateBeer Norway"", Yngwie, who just reached 8000 ratings AND celebrates his birthday at the very same day - talk about excellent timing! :-) Bottle, from trade. Pours a mighty black, oily body with a big caramel-hued creamy retention, which graces the beer with its presence for a little while before slowing down to an elegant film on top of the black surface. While the aroma is not striking at first, further inquiry reveals an highly integrated aromatic profile consisting of several elements: bourbon and burnt espresso up front, then I get the licorice, alcohol, vanilla, wood, leather and some smooth nutty hints somewhere in the mix. Very nice. Taste is strong coffee tones coming in early, then alcohol-propelled wooden oaky tones laced with licorice, vanilla, bourbon and hints of leather. Initially only a breath of bourbon booze is present, but as the sip sets itself in my stomach a warming alcohol sets in and gives off the high ABV. Smooth and oily mouthfeel, with a low carbonation level. The coffee tones are really present and provides a great deal of bitterness throughout the palate, without ever being in the way of such little finesses as the subtle tones of coconut and Brazil nuts in the aftertaste. A very fine bourbon BA stout indeed, and a worthy beer for raising the glass for Yngwie. Chin chin! :-)","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
3448,"2011-08-27",4.1,"2008 Version:
Initial thoughts ... Alcohol and coffee aroma are still pretty strong ... although the coffee has dissipated somewhat from the flavor while the strong alcohol taste usually associated with a fresh KBS is almost nil. Lacing is still pretty nice around the glass with a faint tan band residing just above the top of the liquid throughout the drink. The dissipated coffee flavor brings out more of a chocolate flavor with a creamy finish on the mouth feel. Aftertaste has a bit of the bourbon / oak qualities. Overall I like it ... I dont think aging does this anywhere near the justice that it does with a BCBS ... but I do like the subdued coffee and alcohol tastes (I just think that this years version was a bit over the top with both).","USA","simianninja"

Sweet cocoa, light alcohol, chocolate and vanilla.  Melting ice cream, long chocolate, and light  bourbon on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3448,"2011-08-24",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2011 Aroma: milk chocolate, dark chocolate, oak, bourbon, and a slight hint of almost smoke or pepper. A little more oak. Oak.

Appearance: Black, seemingly thick, with a very, very, very thin red-brown head.

Palate: Overall its silky and smooth, has an interesting puffy texture. Very soft. Not as sticky as most in the style. I prefer Goose Islands BCBS sticky mouthfeel, but this is still a 5/5.

Taste: Big, balanced, smooth. Very, very malty. Nice coffee bitterness to balance it, with some bitter and milk chocolate flavors. It all balances out with big flavors of bitter and sweet. Somewhere around the third quarter you get hit with the toasty bourbon and loads and loads of oak. Very similar to some California Cabernets in this regard. 

Its almost a Vaynerchuk oak-monster. But, its so balanced that you love it. Oak and bourbon are such great friends for beer, and this beer shows off the benefits of the relationship so well.  Absolutely gorgeous beer.

It is like a weird and unique mix of whiskey, chocolate, and vanilla bean (according to my friend, we should be very clear on this last point). The taste for me is where the chocolate notes were brought out and they were masterfully mixed with the vanilla. The whiskey is less prominent in the taste than in the nose, for better or for worse.

Very rich.  Chocolate and vanilla.  The bourbon is very subtle at the edges.  Syrupy in feel but thin in texture.  Gosh thats rich.  Theres a roast there that really backs up the chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon.  I can tell right away that Im going to let this get nice and warm.

Thought I did an aggressive pour but got zero head. Pitch black. When I swirl it, I get a mollasses syrupy coating on the glass and a teensy bit of cafe brown foam that dissipates very quickly.

Smells bourbony, coffee-ish. Maybe too much coffee for me. Well see. Not getting much, if any vanilla or oak.

Too cold. Aaaand way too much coffee grounds taste for me. Guess thats why its a breakfast stout. I get it now. Not going to drainpour but not lovin it. Maybe it will sweeten as it warms up.

3448,"2011-03-31",4.3,"2010 release, had to try it, couldnt wait.

Poured into a goblet. Beer is black and appears thick. Forms a thin head of brown bubbles that is diffuse on the surface and quickly breaks. Head leaves some lacing on the glass, carbonation is low.

For being aged in bourbon barrels, I expected a little more booze. Strong sweet, coffee aroma. Booze and bourbon secondary in the nose. Smells good, not as forward with the bourbon as I thought the BCS is in general. Still smells good.

Its not hot, moderate in body, finishes nicely. Sweet up front, not a lot of bitterness in the back, highly drinkable in the palate. Second taste, chocolate, slight, hint of bitter this time in the back, like coffee. Overall an exceptional beer truly.

Serving type: bottle

Served in a snifter, beer looks as you might expect. Black, thick, brown thin head carbonation low to moderate. Head leaves minimal lacing on the glass.

The aroma of the beer is mostly sweetness, a slight tinge of alcohol and some roast.

The flavor is much more subtle as far as the bourbon flavors are concerned. Its smooth and really drinkable, the overall barrel flavor is there and it rounds out the beer but its not as good as the Canadian. I need to get the breakfast and the Kentucky breakfast and do a side-by-side. There is more bitterness in the back on this one than the others, overall its pretty good. Not my favorite barrel aged imperial stout though.

I love letting my family take a whiff of the beers Im rating, cuz theyre brutally honest. After handing this to my mom, she said, ""Ugghhh! Thats not beer! Thats whiskey!"" Right on the money! Once you get past that HUGE bourbon kick in the teeth, theres a subtle earthy cocoa aroma with hints of roasted coffee and oak. Flavor is a heavy bourbon booziness, roasted coffee, dark cocoa, and subtle vanilla. Pretty thin bodied for an imperial stout; not as syrupy as I was expecting, but maybe its good that it threw a curveball. Ive heard thats what this beer does, and now I know why!

The first sip is an enormous assault on the palate as waves of roasted coffee beans, vanilla, wood, and chocolate attack with no remorse. As the beer slides toward the back of the throat, a distinct woody note lingers and dries the mouth out and fades to a subtle alcohol presence.

Intense bitter roasted coffee is the first thing that hits your palate, followed by the vanilla, some harsh whisky notes, and cocoa.  Intense hop and coffee bittering on the finish as well.

3448,"2011-03-03",4.1,"Pours dark black with hot chocolate head. poured semi-hard into a brandy snifter to get a nice finger of head. the retention was medium. there always remained some swirling foam atop the beer.

The smell is of raosted coffee and chocolate. There is a ton of malt in here to compete with the bourbon and coffee. some oakiness mingled in

The taste is definately a lot like the smell. I get tons of bitter chocolate on this. roasted coffee and roasted malts. there are definately some vanilla and oak in here that i think bring out the chocolate flavors. I catch some dark fruit tastes, in the likes of cherry, fig, prune, or raisin I would say. There is a good deal of alcohol burn in this. The warmer it got the more vanilla and sweetness comes through. the roastiness all but dissapears. the bourbon starts soft but ends strong as you drink through this beer. 

Thick, syrupy, almost chewy mouthfeel. just enough carbonation to scrub itself off.

Took me a long time to plow through a 12 oz bottle of this. So heavy, tons of complex flavors. In the End, i felt it was too boozy.

3448,"2011-02-21",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2017 THe Amazing Kosmickis Highly Acclaimed KBS. Im popping it in celebration of completion of my winter term finals, and appropriately, for breakfast. Served lightly chilled. 09 vintage thanks to scubarex, unfortunately with the twist off, but it is only a year old so im not worried about oxidation. I can smell this one even with the cap on.

Pours into my orange juice glass a dense pitch black with hints of ruby/brown at the extreme edges of the glass. The thick, liquid looks like motor oil as it exits the bottle. The creamy cocoa/tan head is thick and creamy and about a finger thick. It dissipates within a minute leaving behind a frosting of lacing one the sides of the glass and a foamy layer above the beer. Looks tasty.

The smell is bursting with a large hit of coffee with some chocolatey notes and a nice kick of bourbon. The bourbon lends some nice malty scents and a touch of woody vanilla. Unlike the FBS this oen doesnt have any sign of hops on the nose.

This beer is thick and intoxicating. The bourbon takes center stage in the taste, much like a BCS but with a leveling amount of coffee that balances out the beer immensely. The oak and vanilla also make a larger appearance and taste delightful, creating a breakfast stout above the others. THE hops make their presence in the after taste with a tiny hint of citrus, that is one of the main tings that makes this brew so amazing, its subtleties. The coffee, alcohol, and hops linger in the back of the throat while creamy, chocolatey malt lingers in on the tongue and roof of the mouth. The biitterness is perfect and the alcohol and sweetness arent overt or cloying.

The mouthfeel is right on in my opinion, it is lightly carbonated, but not under carbonated. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy without being over the top.

This is a monster of a stout, though Im not a coffee fan the flavor in this beer just explode on the palate and mingle with each other perfectly thus creating a highly delectable beer for my palate.

3448,"2011-02-14",4.7,"At a hefty 11.2 percent ABV and 70 IBU, one expects big flavors, but the layering and complexity of this brew is world class--and probably benefitted from being a few months old. It pours deep and black, with a thin brown, milk-chocolate head that clings to the glass like one of those little rubber wall stickers you had as a kid. The nose is soft, silky, and washes over the tongue and onto the roof of the palate in waves of creamy chocolate and roasted malt. Theres an herbal spiciness with hints of sweet vanilla, earthy tannins, and a lingering dry, malty finish that beckons the next sip. Opening up as it warms, the full mouth feel and alcohol is in perfect balance with the generous hoppy dryness that cleans up the sweetness, without overwhelming it.

3448,"2010-08-22",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2010 Very good barrel-aged imperial stout.  Ive got a few more bottles, so Ill give a better rating soon, but this was great at first blush.  Lots of bourbon.  Little booze.  Good wood and well-blended flavor even in a fresh bottle.  Body wasnt quite as thick as expected/desired.  Fairly balanced between chocolate and roasted flavors.  Good intensity.

Edit: Full bottle all to myself - Im getting lots more booze but a much better feel.  Plus, the beer looks fantastic.  This is definitely a great imperial stout.  The barrel-aging is assertive and the flavor and feel are thick and full.  On the other hand, theres a good deal of booze, particularly in the taste.  Actually, Im really only disliking the fairly strong dose of fusel notes in the finish.  Also, while the mouthfeel is quite good, its not quite up to their Breakfast Stout and some others.

I think this might be my first ever 10/10 award for aroma. Theres just so much going on here, I could never get sick of it, and cant imagine any way it could improve. I get vanilla, chocolate, roasty espresso, rough but pleasant booze, darting hints of raspberry, peat smoke, and many other things I cant pick now. The aromas mix and change with every sniff. In the glass, its a beautiful thing. Jet black, with a dense coffee-crema head which fades to a caramel coloured lace. The flavours are a mouthgasm of flavours, similar to, and supporting the massive nose. New things keep appearing - rose petals, rummy brown sugar, and fresh cream? The palate is a tad ""thin"" - well, thin for a beer that smells and tastes like this, and perhaps I only think so because Im comparing it to the syrupy Bourbon County Stout from Goose Island (rating to come). Its perfectly adequate though, but hey, no beer is perfect, and the mouthfeel is the one part of this beer which could be better. Still a stunner by any measure.","Hamilton, NEW ZEALAND","greig"

T-The flavor is somewhat dull upfront but what can be noticed is vanilla, an essence of sweet bourbon, chocolate, oak, and some roasted flavors. Tastes like a roasted coffee upfront.

Absolutely deserving of its reputation as one of the best beers in the world.  ****Origingal Rating (4/14/10): Bottle from Ottos on Oakland.  A very big, dark stout.  The bourbon flavor is not overpowering at all.  Overall, this is an excellent beer, and Im glad I have another one in the beer fridge.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"

3448,"2010-04-11",4.5,"This has to be top of my list or close to it. Great looking black with a tan head. Aroma of all kinds of stuff. Vanilla, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, sweet roasted malt. Flavor has all of the same with a bit of smoke. Finishes very dry. The alcohol is barely noticeable but you will get a nice warming sensation. I never let it get to room temperature, Maybe Ill be a little more disciplined.","Sicklerville, New Jersey, USA","keepersj12"
3448,"2010-04-11",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of HowardF from TBS...thanks!  First time I could ever get my hands on this - it was a 2009.  Decided to drink it when it was a bit fresher.  The bourbon notes were there, but it wasnt a big vanilla bomb.  Not super overly sweet, a nice bitterness.  They really masked the 11.2% ABV well.  Wish I had a few more bottles because Id love to see how it holds up for future years (anyone want to trade?).","Buffalo, New York, USA","pete4999"
3448,"2010-04-10",4.2,"When I was down in Rochester, where Ill shortly be moving to, I discovered Whistle Binkies bar and grill, which I had heard had a good beer scene.  As we entered, I noticed that one of the bartenders had a beer advocate t-shirt on, which was a good sign.  We sat down and I noticed the beer list was extensive and quite solid.  I noticed some Surly products which is another good sign.  I first ordered a SN Bigfoot and noticed that Bells Batch 9000 was on the bottle list.  When I asked, they were out of it, so then I asked for Founders Double Trouble.  The next thing I know, a female waitress comes over with a bottle of Founders KBS.  Now Founders is still relatively new to Minnesota.  Ive been able to try many of Founders high end beers, however, the KBS has alluded me so far (Ive even had the Canadian Breakfast Stout).  Now onto the beer:  the pour is deep black, with a minimal head.  Aromas of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, and vanilla.  The bourbon is really well integrated here.  And that is the key...make sure the bourbon is not overpowering and its got my attention.  This beer is for the most part worthy of its hype and would rate anywhere from solid to borderline spectacular.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

The taste was amazing with roast and coffee coming in first followed by some chocolate then the bourbon and vanilla flavors come at the end of each drink. This coats your mouth with creamy goodness followed by some hottness in the end. In my opinion this beer lives up to the hype it has been given.

The palate is rich with a medium-full body, with intense lingering of bourbon, chocolate malt, smoke and vanilla. Attractive lacing.  This stout makes me smile.  Definitely moreish!  Reverence and dedication to sensory exploration is a must.  This is not a quaffing ale but a serious sipper for pondering and reflection.  The alcohol is hidden behind the richness.

Lots of wood flavors with a subtle whiskey boozey note over strong coffee earthy hoppy stout. The finish is oaky, boozey, dark chocolate, espresso, warming goodness. Mouthfeel is full and velvety - like very full bold coffee w/ light carbonation. Mild boozy/alcoholic astringency in the back. Overall, very strong-flavored stout.

Just so strong it defies freshness. Fullish body with mild carbonation. Flavor is oh so coffee. Theres bitter, but that could be the coffee. Theres oaky wood. Gives astringency. Vanilla or bourbon? It is not coming to me. But something is really going oily all over my mouth and lips. Buried in here somewhere is that thick essence proving this was aged in a spirit barrel.

3448,"2010-03-26",4.4,"On tap at the Flying Saucer in KC. Pours a black body with a finger-width, very creamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a very thick lacing. Gorgeous on tap. Aroma is surprisingly still filled with fresh coffee beans. Dont get me wrong, I know the the standard Breakfast Stout is filled with coffee, but after trying the Canadian Breakfast Stout, I was expecting the coffee to be a bit more subdued. I was wrong. Theres a good amount of bourbon and if the coffee werent so strong, this would probably be a bourbon bomb, but the smell on this is fantastic. A good amount of vanilla with some wood, plenty of rich chocolates, and a light hop. Just a touch of burnt ash. As this warms, the coffee mellows just a bit and allows everything else to shine. Flavor is just as nice. Starts with a very deep, dark chocolate that lasts throughout with just a touch of sweetness. Its like a melted dark chocolate bar that lays across the tongue while the other flavors develop. A good amount of woody coffees that never get out of hand as well as some vanilla bourbon. The bourbon is subtle at first, but grows in the finish as this dries completely. The dry finish creeps up on you. I didnt notice how dry this was at first because of all the intense flavors. A very light hop bitterness accompanies plenty of coffee and a touch of ash in the finish. Very lengthy aftertaste after a bit of a chalky feel (only knock on the palate, but with this amount of coffee, its almost expected). Full body with a creamy carbonation. Overall, damnit this is outstanding. My kind of beer. An abundance of bold flavors that maintain an amazing balance. The coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate work wonders together. Holy shit, this was awesome.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Aroma is heavy coffee for me with a hint of chocolate and maybe a note o bourbon.  Thick and chewy mouthfeel with massive coffee and bourbon flavors.  Finish is a sticky chocolate one that hangs around for awhile and then leaves you with some coffee notes on your tongue.  Opened at about 50 degrees, definitely got more boozy as it warmed up.

More intense wood on the sip, blackened grain, coffee grounds and a deceptive finish.  At first it finished easy, some coffee notes, clean and rich.  Then came the wood, little more tannic bite.

  The Kentucky Breakfast Stout has a wonderful flavor profile with a palate that shows where it has grown up compaired to its younger brother.  The head is a wonderful amber brown with amazing retention and the aroma fills the nose with roasted coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, and a wonderfully subtle blend of bourbon whisky with the expected accompanying vanilla and charred oak.

3448,"2010-03-16",4.5,"2009 batch on tap at the Brewpub.  Deep rich brown in a snifter glass with a thin tan head.  Aroma was huge coffee, bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, chocolate, all kinds of dark rich alcohol smells.  The bourbon came through but did not overwhelm.  Flavor was similar.  A lot of coffee notes, some good bourbon kick, some vanilla from the oak and a fair bit of roasted malt and chocolate.  This beer just would not quit.  A little heavy on the alcohol presence, but nothing to intimidating.  Wonderful beer.","Greenbelt, Maryland, USA","ApisAles"
3448,"2010-03-15",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2011 2011 batch.  Phenomenal.  Less boozy than last years, even when fresh.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Near perfection.

Enjoying my second bottle of the Feb 18, 2010 batch on January 2, 2011.  Damn.  Damn, damn, damn is this good.  Gotta give a little bump to the score particularly due to the incredible aroma.  I could sniff on this all night.  Wow.  Appearance also gets a bump and Im enjoying the reduced booziness from the fresh bottle.  One of the best beers Ive ever had.  A special blend of all the coffee-infused Imperial Stout goodness with the warmth and complexity of a fine Bourbon.  Fantastic.  Incredible.  On and on and on and on, adjective upon adjective upon adjective...NOMNOMNOMNOMNOM
12oz bottled Feb 18, 2010.  Served cool room temperature into a Duvel tulip.  Pours black, quite thick with a one finger brown head that reduces to a small foamy ring and cap, leaves some spots of lacing.  Aroma is heavy on the wood, nice amount of bourbon, vanilla, strong coffee, some chocolate, a little charred.  Flavor brings in a very good dose of dark chocolate and coffee bitterness, vanilla, bourbon, fair amount of alcohol, especially early in the glass.  Mouthfeel is full, but not overly so, feels like there is oatmeal here, does get a tad sticky, low carbonation.  Overall, for a coffee stout, any coffee influence is generally overshadowed by the charred oak and bourbon.  Still excellent impression overall, for my first ever KBS.  Never thought Id see this on store shelves in Georgia, and its quite a treat.  Every single Founders beer Ive had has blown me away.  This one had the most hype, but lives up to it in every way.

3448,"2010-03-03",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2012 12oz bottle thanks to viggo. 2009 vintage.
Appearance : Deep opaque black with tiny brown head. Thin lacing.

Aroma : Intense coffee with roasted malt and lots of hops. Light vanilla hints. Mostly coffee and hops. Light oak.

Taste :  Coffee, roasted malt with vanilla notes of bourbon. Light sweetness. Dry finish with bitter coffee and hops. Quite hoppy. Carbonation is very soft even a bit flat. Oak on finish mixes along with the hops. 

Overall : Very intense overall. Carbonation could have been a tad more lively. Alcohol is present but is accompanied well by the coffee and the bourbon. Nose has a bit too much coffee. I like that the bourbon doesnt take over on everything. Taste also has a little bit too much coffee. Hope are quite good. Very nice sipper. Alcohol is rather well hidden. Very good but too much coffee.

Appearance : Deep black, huge head. Creamy expresso head. Incredible lacing.

Aroma : Lots of roasted malts, some coffee. Not much hops with some vanilla. Nice dry dark chocolate.

Taste : Roasted malt, sweet with hints of vanilla. Finish very roasty and dry. Some oily and resinous hops but not much. Dry finish. Awesome finish.

Overall : Very nice stuff. This was among the best stouts I had during the EBF. I liked this one a bit more than the Canadian Breakfast Stout. Need to re-rate with a full serving. March 3rd 2010. 9,5,8,3,17;4.1","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Pleasant but overall mellow.  The flavor shows black coffee; somewhat bitter, vanilla, and heavy on the chocolate.  Oak and bourbon mix in as well but are very much complementary and less prominent than expected.  Almost no trace of alcohol, which is quite impressive, and slightly warming.  But this drinks far lighter than expected, almost coming across as thin at times.  Its good, a nice dessert/after dinner sipper, but no way top 50 good and I guess Im a bit underwhelmed.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

The taste is heavy bourbon stout flavor with some roasty flavor that feels like a nice biscuit flavor that was burnt in the toaster.

Pitch black and viscous pour with a minimal beige head that dissipates quickly and leaves a minimal ring of lacings.

The flavor is rather sweet with lots of coffee and bourbon character. The body is not as full as I had thought it would be, but the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The chocolate is more pronounced in the taste than in the smell. Notes of woody bourbon, powdered chocolate, lots of vanilla, oak and roasted malts. Hints of licorice and fudge. Perhaps a note of tar. The finish is bitter and has a nice warming feeling to it.

A - Pours black and viscous with no head to speak of even as I poured more aggressively at the end. It could definitely use more head but still beautiful.

S - Coffee and bourbon. Definitely a good breakfast. Slight malt quality to it. Time for my catch phrase. I wish they made candles that smelled like this.

T - Bourbon, chocolate and coffee. The coffee is by far the strongest flavor. The oak comes through in the aftertaste followed by a bit of burn. Not too much burn though. The lingering taste is just amazing.

M - Thick. Very Nice.

D - Im trying not to house this thing. Must... be... strong. The high ABV is definitely not a problem here. Well hidden.

Taste was thin, beer lacked depth in character, hints of roasted barley and chocolate malt, but dominated by booziness and bourbon.

The small head is dark leather brown and dissipates quickly into a small ringlet.  The aroma is honestly comprised of mostly a big dose of fresh roasted coffee.  Underneath this is a small helping of nice bourbon and oak characteristics including a lot of vanilla and a touch of wood.  The sweet aroma of whiskey touches through but not much.  A drink taken in while inhaling starts quite sweet and flows into wood and vanilla mixed with a touch of citrus.  The mid is all added coffee and this is definitely what lingers with undertones of very dark chocolate.  As it warms the chocolate comes out more and more.  There is a nice carbonation that mingles perfectly with the silky mouthfeel.  This is honestly good but I was expecting more bourbon stout and less breakfast stout.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

3448,"2009-09-19",4.4,"Bottle thanks to Arbitrator on BA.  This beer owns something fierce, almost but not quite equall to the legendary Canadian Breakfast Stout.  Pours a viscous, oily jet black with a small, creamy tan head that leaves a ring around the glass.  This has legs like a Swedish bikini model, i.e. theyre very good.  Aroma is coffee, roast, chocolate, and high-quality Kentucky bourbon.  Flavor is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt that adds a little sweetness, vanilla, oak, and of course loads of bourbon.  Not too much though.  Almost but not quite as good as Goose Island Bourbon County Stout.  A little boozy, but certainly not unpleasantly so...or maybe I was just too drunk to notice (and you cant blame me since we had all three Breakfast Stout incarnations at this tasting + other awesome stuff).

3448,"2009-09-11",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2010 Dans Bachelor Party Extended Weekend Rating #52 of 90. On tap at Founders in Grand Rapids. Pours pitch black with brown creamy head.

Sweet, coffee, chocolate, bourbon...SO easy to drink...and SO tasty! Gald I have a bottle in my cellar.

(Re-rate) From fresh 10 bottle, just for the fun of bourbon. Pitch black with thick creamy brown head. Nose is rich, strong bourbon with dry, thick wood. Flavor is obviously very strong bourbon, but closer to 55-60 degs it has a lot more dry and almost salty wood barrel going on. Definitely some leather/peat taste and an overall smooth mouthfeel. Very strong beer, and heavy on bourbon at this point. Something to be said for it fresh, yet Im intrigued to try it after at least 2 years age.  Curious to see if the coffee comes out with age, cause its inevident right now.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","awiseman01"

Tons of coffee in the aroma mixing with some sweet bourbon notes along with some vanilla and chocolate. Flavor is a huge explosion of coffee, bourbon, roasted malts, and chocolate.

Undertones of the bourbon aging, and chocolate. Not much really. Smooth as silk texture. Rolls over the tounge. Upfront dark fruit,chocoalte malt and wood. Heavy ashy,coffee,bourbon flavor follow. Finish is lingering balanced malt and wood from the bourbon aging,with a bare hint of vanilla.  Im guessing this is about a 8-10 month old bottle....Suprised for all thats here its pretty balanced out and real tasty. Also,not near as sweet as expected. As it opens a bit the ashiness goes away a little. A somewhat one sided aroma and heavy ashiness really are the only negatives here. Maybe not the most complex malt profile,but ...

A blast of flavor, with a cool mix of coffee and bourbon that works a little better than in the aroma.   The mouthfeel definitely brings it down though, with too much astringency and alcohol.

3448,"2009-08-19",4.2,"(trade with xmarcnolanx) At first pour it looks like motor oil with no sign of a head, but by the time the beer is in the glass theres a dark tan head about 2mm high, which settles down to a ring of foam. Zero light penetrates the glass when held up to a 60w bulb! Strong aroma of cocoa powder with hints of vanilla. I could sit here taking air hits off the glass for a long time its so good. Remember I said looked like motor oil? It has a thick body of motor oil when drinking too. Huge flavors of coconut and vanilla. Make no mistake this is a sipping beer, the flavor is so intense. Once you get over the extreme roasty aftertaste theres a warming on the palate of the bourbon which lasts for quite some time. While this may not turn out to be your favorite beer of all time, if you like imperials and you like alcohol barrell aged brews you MUST try this one.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

At like $9.00, it was well worth it honestly.  The aroma is rather relaxed, notes of coffee are well hidden with the vanilla and oak scents.  The flavor is equally relaxed, but the coffee is still there.  It has this amazing buttery-nutty taste to the coffee flavor, not the burnt coffee flavor that is often in the big stouts.

Opaque dark brown body with low carbonation, a pencil thin head and spotty lacing.

Well, it finally is here. Many thanks to those who hooked me up with this deal. Let warm for 20 and pour into a Portsmouth snifter.

Yup, its deep dark epsresso brown with a fair wallop of viscosity. Brown sugar 1/2 finger head mellows to maple then ginger color. Lacing is good. Viscous but not gelationous.

Theres dry slate cream here. Sure, vanilla and bourbon but very understated along with woodiness. Not much alcohol to speak of but we know its there. Big roasted malt - no husky patent tannins. Well-refined. Creamy like coffee ice cream. Tough to find a lot of fault here.

This little concoction is insane. Sure, theres copious oak, vanilla and bourbon. But its so...&*(%ing...smooth! The overabundance of this is subtle if that makes a lick of sense. Big-time creaminess. No booze to speak of but a previously unmentioned hop presence of a little grass and some big coffee roasted notes. Well-played.

It was a perfect oil black pour with a nice dark khaki head (that needs a tall vigorous pour to stir up).  The aroma was vanilla, oak, and chocolate.  The flavor was the same but with a major step up.  The flavor with the palate made it taste and feel like a nice rich chocolate milkshake.  The abv. was hidden very well.  IT got hotter as it warmed but was still very cozy and tasty. So smooth and easygoing.  If you like imperial stouts you need to try this.

The aromas were rich in Bourban with hints of vanilla, coffee, and chocolate.  Certainly a smell worthy of this stout.

3448,"2009-05-22",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2014 12 oz bottle 2009 vintage courtesy of either Binnys South Loop or Sams South Loop (Chicago, IL). Poured into a tulip, a pitch black thick viscous pour with small dark brown head that laces some, never dies completely. Aromas take a touch of smoke and oak, vanilla and chocolate mix liberally with bourbon, bitter roasted malts, and some soy sauce. Pretty good, just a little surprising. After warming a bit, some good sweetness comes through, syrupy and similar to the Breakfast Stout. Good ash, coffee, and roast going on. Initial is thick, putting on a good heavy body, warmth as it flows down the throat. Good oak, dryness, and vanilla mix with ash, assertive roasted malts, some lighter chocolate in there as coffee bitterness takes some of the more prominent sweet/bitter clash. This brew takes on large roast and coffee bitterness further into the body, much lighter on bourbon than I would have expected, until some notes of vanilla and oak peek through. Surprisingly, for 11.2%, this is fairly quaffable. Bitterness, roast, coffee, and touch of smokiness. The bourbon is less noticeable than other barrel aged brews, a tad light for me even. This is pretty good, but a little light on the palate and in body for the style. Cheers to it!

3448,"2009-05-20",4.5,"12 oz. bottle (2009) in a snifter. Rating beer is a curious affair- so much is dependent upon ones mood, general mindset and other extraneous factors that invariably have nothing to do with the beer in question. I have variously rated beers when I have been stuffed up, pleasantly tired, hot and bothered and philosophically relaxed. That I was in the perfect mood to appreciate a beer as well done as the KBS was perhaps something to be truly thankful for- at the end of a long day, having worked out, read a tremendous amount and finished up a number of things on my to-do list, the KBS presented the ideal nightcap. Onwards to the beer...it pours a glutinous black w/ a sizzling tan head that rapidly diminishes into some minimal lacing; aroma has the characteristically incredible three-coffee profile of the regular Breakfast Stout- the sheer richness and depth of the coffee aroma cannot be expressed in mere words. It is complemented nicely by vanilla (from the Oak I suspect) and Bourbon notes, along w/ hints of the other Breakfast Stout aromas, albeit to a lesser degree; flavor is sweet and malty w/ stronger chocolate than in the aroma, more of that coffee and burnt sugar...ends on the coffee note w/ a bourbon burn towards the back of ones throat. Seems thinner in the body than it actually is, due to its Bourbon-y nature. A lovely experience, truly.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","noompa"

Pours a sludgy motor-oil black with a minimal burnt mocha-colored head. Big, full-bodied, roasty coffee hits your nose right away - like a filter full of just-used grounds. Its beginning to make me think that 8pm isnt a good time to drink this one. =) Some chocolate, tobacco and vanilla as well, with bourbon-infused oak also prominent. Crap this is a big brew - it socks you in the face and then laughs at your astonished reaction on the way down. The coffee is really prominent in the flavor, but its incredibly smooth and creamy, with some cacao notes as well - this actually reminds me a lot of a good tiramisu, chased with a stiff Irish coffee. For 11.2%, it hides the alcohol fairly well, but its still a bit boozy.

Appearance - Pours thick with very little head, maybe a quarter inch of head. Very little head remains after it settles and there is a little tinty ring of bubbles clinging to the glass. This coats the glass with a swirl, very thick film, awesome.

Smell - Very unique smell, like candied bourbon. My God this is awesome. A little bit of an alcohol presence in the nose, but it isnt overpowering at all. This is the best bourbon barrel aged beer smell I have ever smelled. There is sweet, sweet bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits.

Taste - Damn, that is some beautiful bourbon. Sweet bourbon. Light and never overpowering bourbon. Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and finishes so well with some sweet vanilla. This tastes extremely well balanced. 

Mouthfeel - Very thick, coats the mouth nicely. I could see myself enjoying the next bottle with a cigar, a light subtle cigar of course. This is carbonated to the perfect amount, lending this beer a creaminess that is rivaled by very few.

Drinkability - That high abv is going to hurt it on this one. I cant drink many of these in a row, but man I had no problem finishing this bottle.

3448,"2009-04-28",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2013 Chocolate, coffee, wood, and smoke in the aroma. Very dark brown and silky pour with a dark brown head that dissapears within seconds. Very thick on the palate with a strong alcohol burn in the back of the throat. Chocolate, wood, raisins, and salt are the flavors that stand out. I would have liked a more profound bourbon flavor. All I could really pick up was the barrel. Still a very good stout, not too sticky either..Rerate 5/18/13 current batch. It pours very black and oily with a disappearing brown head. The aroma is enticing in a dessert like way with tons of chocolate syrup, coffee, caramel, vanilla, wood and some brown sugar. Smells awesome. The flavor is similar with vanilla and chocolate coming first followed by strong bourbon and coffee in the finish. Very thick on the palate and appropriate carbonation. No off flavors here as some have noted just thick imperial stout goodness. I can appreciate the balance of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and roast here. Delicious. No change to initial rating even though this is better than I remember from four years ago.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3448,"2009-04-27",4.3,"Bottle received via trade. Dark silky black pour, barely noticable carbonation and rich dark chocolate and bourbon aroma.

3448,"2009-04-26",4.2,"This beer is a meal, thick and cream yet crisp. Very good. Orange skin coats the inside of the glass when you take a sip, fingers dissipate quickly. Little to no head (brown beige pond-scum residue).  Opened this 09 bottle next to an 09 breakfast stout. The breakfast stout is a little more seltzery, also much less in the aroma dept. To be honest, they are very different beers. Both so well balanced. Coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, whisky undertones.

This is how I love my stouts to look. Huge wood and roast aroma. Not hard to smell at all. Just an amazing aroma, of wood, chocolate. Chocolate is very aromatic. A delicious smell. Wish it had some bourbon smell, but very aromatic. Oh man, perfect flavor. Nice thick chocolate, slight coffee taste, with an awesome bourbon finish. Just a wonderful bourbon taste that lingers. Nice woody taste. A perfectly nuanced beer. Overall, my favorite beer. Nice hop taste mixed in wood that bourbon/wood aftertaste. Let this sucker warm up and it just gets better.

Color is black with a very thin brown head; it appears to be very thick.  Strong coffee and chocolate flavor up front with a vanilla and alcohol finish.  The bourbon aging gives a wonderful vanilla flavor that really does not taste boozy like you would expect from bourbon.

3448,"2009-04-22",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2017 Pours black with tan head.  Thick and oily pour.   Aroma is coffee and bourbon.  Flavor is the same, coffee and strong bourbon notes, which balance the coffee brilliantly.  Its a heavy, high alcohol brew so it takes some time to consume, which makes it all the better.
Re-rate 2014 - my initial rating is of the 2009 batch, and Ive had both the 2010 and 2011 versions as well.  2009-2011 batches were awesome.  I never got to try 2012, but 2013 was significantly worse than in years past.  It was no longer a distinctive brew as it tasted much like the regular Breakfast Stout. Founders redeemed themselves in 2014 with a beer much closer to the 2009-2011 juggernaut.   I cant help but give this beer a perfect score, because it is perfect. 2015: Knocking this down a few points.  Tastes like a smoother, more mellow regular Breakfast Stout, which is fine.  But its not KBS.  2016 re-rate:  Excellent brew this year.  Well balanced, nice bourbon, vanilla and coffee.  2017 re-rate:  Mostly dark chocolate.  Strong coffee.  A little alcohol burn.  Not the best.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","Holtguy"

Resampled (2/25/10) the same batch a month short of year later. The nose is still incredible with the coconut edge of the bourbon really smelling tasty.

3448,"2009-03-25",4.7,"12 oz. Murky black brown pour, light does not penetrate, brown around the edges. Very limited brown head, a ring sticks around and a swirl leaves a minibubble lace around the glass.
Aroma is abundant with roasted malts, espresso, vanilla, woody tones, caramel and molasses. All this does nothing but increase as it warms.
Mouthfeel is near creamy, surprisingly a bit lively for the dissapation of the head.
Taste is everything in the nose intermingling. Great barrel and vanilla one second, dark chocolate, molasses and espresso the next. Finishes with just a hint of coffee, and molasses. There are no negatives in bitterness/sourness or anything overdone in this. As long as you are ready for what you should expect from this, there is absolutely no dissapointment.
This is the best double stout I have had sans aging flat out. There is no need to cellar this to get what you are expecting. I have several to age, but Im guessing this will be one that does not change much from age. The Alesmith stouts are the only others Ive had that can equal this without age.","from Michigan now in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","timsilvia32"

How: Bottle 12oz.  Ive had it many times before but Im finally rating one.  This one is a 1 year bottle given to me by dmac 1 year ago, thanks a lot Dave.
The look: Black body topped by a tan ring of foam
In long: Nose is roasted and black coffee. Taste is more of the same.  Sweet cacao upfront, roasted coffee beans, alcohol moderately apparent, some black chocolate, rather sweet, brown sugar, molasses hint, low on the fruity side of things, low-profile hops with mild bitterness.  Only a light barrel presence.  This truly is a superior Imperial Stout but I had it next to the Expedition Stout of the same age (1 year old) and honestly the KBS doesnt hold a candle to the Expedition, unless of course you stick a candle in the KBS bottle but then you wont be able to drink it","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The nose is of old coffee blended with bourbon and a light note of cigarette ash. This is NOT among my favorite noses on an imperial stout.

Dark brownish black. Head is touch, but retention is okay. 

Coffee and malts, with chocolate notes. It’s quite reminiscent of a Coffee Crisp bar (more familiar to the Canadians, I believe, though it can be found in the US, as well). A nice blend of the two. 

Very deep roasted malts and coffee flavours. Some bitterness and a touch of astringency that stings a little. A creamy mouthfeel and light on the carbonation... almost like heavily creamed coffee in some ways.

Tasty, and somewhat candy line in some ways. The coffee flavours might be a little on the artificial side, but definitely taste great. I’d happily have it again, though it’s almost sinful.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","Proteus93"

3448,"2008-09-13",4.1,"Poured into a Stone Old Guardian tulip glass, ""Is good for everything a stout ought to be good for""!!!

Appearance is thick and dense brown-to-black motor oil, minimal brown head mostly disappears but there is some cream and bubbles on the edges, very mild lacing.

Smell is huge roasty malts, espresso with tones of bitter chocolate, bourbon, woody oak, and vanilla are prominent, touch of dark fruits and molasses/ brown sugar.

Taste is predominately bitter coffee/espresso complimented well by the bourbon alcohol and wood presence and backed up with bittersweet chocolate, there is great balance here between those primary flavors, some molasses and alcohol warming in the finish.

Mouthfeel is very full-bodied, thick and viscous texture you need to chew through, ample carbonation.

Drinkability is good, I liked this considerably better than the original Breakfast stout which was much more coffee-forward and not as balanced, the alcohol is subdued despite the 11% level, this was definitely a treat, hopefully I can get my hands on more in the future.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

Alcohol is slightly present at the finish with a slight burn in the back of the throat but it also warms the belly.

Heady aroma of sweet coffee, caramel malt, dark dried fruit, and oxidized notes along with a slightly smokey, almost honey edge.  Flavor contains the perfect level of sweetness to support and compliment the incredibly complex, multi-layered flavor profile.  The first level of flavors consists of dark roasted malt and subtle hops bitterness followed by bourbon sweetness, smoke, and wood-aged characteristics.  Coffee is present as well but doesn’t overpower or dominate the other flavors.  Still more flavors arise with a hint of dark black cherries and well-integrated alcohol.

Smells like old/used coffee grinds, an ash tray with water poured into it, a touch of vanilla/booze sweet undertones, and lots of whiskey/oak character. A bit harsh. The body has a substantial feel without being cloying. Starts off harsh and one dimensional with just the base beer character showing it’s overwhelming coffee grind flavor. However, as it warms a touch of vanilla comes through, followed by more bourbon/cask character. The sweetness from the barrel balanced the base beers homogeneous bitter coffee grind character. (I’m not really a fan of the Founders Breakfast Stout) But this stuff gained a lot from the barrel, giving it that bourbon sweet bite and balancing the harshness. It worked out really well. This is significantly better than the Breakfast Stout (which had no subtleties) In short, the barrel character saved the beer and gave it some nuances to enjoy.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

2010 bottle on 8/15/10.  deep black pour with a thinner 1/8"" tan head which fades to a thin lacing.  wonderful nose full of sweet chocolate, deep espresso and lots of bourbon.  as the beer warms and recedes in the glass, the coffee notes become more pronounced, while the bourbon fades off.  Fresh from the bottle pour, there is a perfect blend of coffee and bourbon.  Sweet chocolate thick body (almost chewy), with lots of vanilla, oak, bourbon and smooth dark roasted coffee.  It really doesnt get much better than this.  On the finish, the bitterness comes forward and you can really feel the 70 IBUs on this.  A dark piece of chocolate coated with espresso beans soaked in bourbon.  A true masterpiece by Founders.

Rich and complex aroma of lightly buttery bourbon, coffee and half and half, chocolate, fruits, and a bit of alcohol.  A stoutish aroma with the depth of one from a good barley wine.

If I strain, I maybe could find some roasted coffee and buttery bourbon, but it would probably be more confirmation bias than anything else.  If I were to close my eyes, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between this and a similarly over-the-top bitter and alcoholic barley wine or double IPA.  Normally this happens when I drink an imperial stout too cold, but that is hardly the case here.  I decanted it at room temperature in a brandy snifter, and it still tastes like this.  My only regret is that my fair and honest score, though below this beer’s average, doesn’t quite articulate my disappointment with this beer.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

It would come out exactly the same.","highland, Indiana, USA","inkubus27"

3448,"2008-07-20",4.4,"Bottle from dchmela (endless thanks!). Pours inky thick, completely black,  forming a big head of bubbles that dissipate with a slip of the glass upward or downward in trails. The head has a ruby tint and laces astonishingly well. Aroma is complex and inviting, at times giving way mostly to bourbon and coffee, but then letting oak and vanilla seep in, only to be further intensified by fruit notes (cherries and raspberries). Mouthfeel is just right, thick but not heavy, light enough to give a perfect background to the massive depth of the beer. The flavor is just as complex and offers up much of the same, impressive and in perfect balance. Mildly bitter roastiness compliments alcoholic bourbon and chocolate/cherry sweetness. The flavors sweep across the tongue and leave behind only slight tinges of chocolate and coffee, an alcoholic heaviness, and the delightful sense of having experienced something very special. As the beer warms and the glass drains, the alcohol presence becomes more noticeable and takes away only slightly from the overall impression.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"

Poured a nice black color, with hues of red when held to the light. Tan colored head with a tid bit of lacing. Smell was very nice, fresh roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla and some nice wood and bourbon notes as well. Taste was even better. The coffee started out but quickly I noticed a nice wooden and bourbon flavor, paired with vanilla and hints of cocoa. Mouthfeel had low carbonation and was on the lighter side of full bodied, but still relatively thick. I’d love to have more of this and look forward to getting some when it’s released again.

3448,"2008-05-27",4.0,"Pours into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip with an almost two-finger thick, cocoa stained, dark tan colored head.  The beer is a thick black color that shows no light through it.  Ample roasted grain notes of black coffee and charcoal are joined by a sort of chalky note that is almost musty (though not quite).  Dark chocolate aromas couple with a rich nuttiness and a solid toasted bread crust note are found just behind the huge coffee character that even provides a touch of tartness to the aroma.  Despite being such a huge stout, this actually seems to be dominated by the coffee aromatics, though it is offset at times by the nice chocolate aromatics.  I dont really get much in the way of Bourbon character in the aroma, which is actually a promising sign for me.

Thick and chewy up front, yet with such a huge roast malt and coffee character that it never becomes overly sweet.  The beer finishes with a hit of Bourbon barrel flavors that provide a touch of vanilla and a deep buttery note that lingers for quite some time in the finish.  Up front rich chocolate notes are quite noticeable (providing some balance to the roast character), these notes stick around some times through to the finish, where the Bourbon dominates, and are joined by a deep, toasted, nutty flavor.  After the first sip, that initial wave of strong Bourbon notes seems to die down some; likely my palate just got used to it, but it becomes much more in balance with the rest of the beer.  This definitely has a touch of tartness to it that is a result of both the ample burnt / roast notes (both coffee and grain) as well as some of the Bourbon influence.  The finish also has a touch of hot Bourbon alcohol to it that is noticeable more as an aromatic oral nasal thing, but definitely makes me feel like I am exhaling alcohol.

At times a certain fruit character is noticeable that makes me think of sour prunes, figs and raisins; all of which have been left under the broiler to develop a bit of char.  As the beer warms up and loses a bit of carbonation it becomes much more creamy textured and smooth, it also becomes much more mocha / chocolate flavored than it was previously, almost richly so.

I am not sure if my nose is not quite working tonight or what, but I am quite surprised how little of the Bourbon barrel influence is noticeable in the aroma.  In the end the balance between roast character and smooth chocolate become really nice, the Bourbon barrel seems to meld into the background such that it supplies a nice complexity; so definitely serves this more towards 59°F / 15°C to get the best flavor balance.  Much better and much more balanced than I was expecting; definitely a very good, moderate use of Bourbon Barrel character and coffee if drunk on the warm side.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Some malts and traces of bourbon are present, but not overpowering, very nice.  Even some hints of chocolate.  Taste is similar to the smell...imagine that...with wonderful roastedness shining through.  Very slight bourbon flavor, which i love in moderation.  Unlike some BB aged stouts, where i feel like im shooting Jack Daniels damn near.  A medium body, with very smooth creamy feel.  Aftertaste is mostly roastedness.  Really great stout.","Wesley Chapel, Florida, USA","BigMilly8"
3448,"2008-04-08",4.5,"Bottle courtesy Ty5592 - Thanks bud!  2007 vintage.  Pours black as night with a pretty nice sized dark tan head.  Aroma is very nice, and not overly bourbon like many other similar brews...theres some telltale bourbon accents, but lots of roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla, oaky accents and burnt alcohol.  Flavor is very well done.  The alcohol is very evident, but, well, it should be to an extent in a beer like this.  The bourbon flavor meshes nicely with smooth milk chocolate, roasted, sweet coffee, heavy sweet malt, and a good dose of vanilla.  Finish is pristine...very smooth with an oily, but not over-burdening glaze of the palate.  I could drink this stuff on a regular basis...if only it were easily attainable.  The regular Bkfst Stout was good, but the bourbon aging definitely does some wonders!","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"

Beautiful black thick pour with amazing brown chocolate milk mocha colored head that is thick and enticing.  Aroma is bold and full of oak, roasted coffee beans, and vanilla.  Flavor is balanced and not muted.  It is vanilla, oak, and roasted maltiness.  It has a nice subtle bourbon meets dark chocolate finish.  Mouthfeel is nice but a tad on the thin and watery side.

Aroma of bourbon and oak with some coffee and earth sprinkled in.  Initial flavor is dominated by alcohol and coffee, with some bourbon noted in there at times as well.  Flavor ended with much of the same but almost became sweeter from chocolate and less of the bitter coffee taste.  Tons of lacing, very heavy body, very limited carbonation, and the alcohol was definitely detectable in this one.

A thin head of tan foam lasted throughout, leaving some thick lace.  The aroma of the beer was made up of a heavy dose of strong coffee, chocolate, smoke, burnt malt, and just a hint of bourbon.  The flavor consisted of sweet chocolate, vanilla, espresso roast coffee, and a very nice, mellow bourbon flavor.  The bourbon was not overpowering or in the way, just complimentary to the other flavors.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and slightly sticky.  Very light carbonation.  A really nice imperial stout that uses barrel aging to add another layer of flavor...not overtake the base beer.  Like a cup of strong coffee with a nip of whiskey.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Maybe it was due to the freshness (brand new bottle),, but I found the coffee in this one to be of a much higher quality. Adding the bourbon aging was also a huge plus. It seems that on some sips, this beer got close to a milkshake taste and feel while on others it was a balanced bourbon brew.","Orland Park, Illinois, USA","LeMunche"

3448,"2008-03-17",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2010 [08 bottle sampled 3.17.08]  Pours somewhat thick black with a small wispy brown head.  Strong aroma of ground coffee, some alcohol, oak and earth/dirt.  Bitter! wow thick black coffee, gritty, some vanilla in the finish.  A little more one-dimensional than I was expecting, but way smooth and  drinkable.  Roasted/burned coffee beans.  Pretty dry for the style, and I like that.  I see where it gets its name from though, thisll wake ya up and really strong coffee flavor.   Reminds me slightly of Olfabrikken Porter, but more drinkable.  ""A hint of coffee..."" is a bit of an understatement.

[rerate spring 08 bottle enjoyed 10.29.09]  Pours a shinny obsidian color with a fizzy foamy mocha head.  Aroma of stale coffee beans, hard roast, bourbon is very faint, dirty coffee filter, some light vanilla and a touch of booze.  The 09 bottles seem to be way more barrel forward.  
The bourbon and barrel only really linger in the aftertaste, slight burn.  Flavor follows, corse coffee, lots of bitter dark creamy chocolate.  Medium/full bodied, creamy, with corse sizzling carbonation that is slightly distracting 4.5.  I think I prefer regular breakfast stout! I am actually pleased that this held up as well as it did..  8.4.8.4.17 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

[spring 08 bottle] figured I should drink this before the coffee goes to shit. Aroma of stale coffee, cream, slight bourbon.  The bourbon is really nice on the first sip but then is harder to detect with each successive sip, soy, cream, stale coffee, lost its depth and edge, love the way the barrel note has mellowed but I know now to drink these fairly fresh... coffee does not hold up! Medium/full, creamy, slick oily, faint carb.  8.4.8.4.16 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

 [2010 bottle, 3.23.10]  Strong aroma of ground coffee and oatmeal, not much bourbon, maybe just a touch.  Flavor is quite a bit different than other vintages, cookie, very light bourbon, fusel alcohol, ash, fruity, weird bitterness, floral, just not right, maybe a touch vegetal, charcoal.  This does have a very nice woody cedar-like quality, lightly oaky but more woody/cedary/peppery, more oak chip like and not bourbon barrel.  Medium/full bodied, a bit heavy on the carbonation relatively, kind of airy fizzy but still creamy.  8.4.8.4.15.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . 

[2009 bottle rated 6.22.10]  Pours an oily super dark brown near black but still quite brown with basically no head but some sticky dark tan lacing.  Aroma of crunchy coffee, medium super nice vanilla, very nice bourbon and oak aroma, super dark caramelized sugars, slick, dark, dark dark molasses, spicy woody oak, bourbon again... love it.  Flavor is a bit more oily, touch of soy, crunch stale coffee, almost sour, sour cream, balanced bourbon, so Tyranena like now, the finish is a bit soyish with some sweeter notes, the aftertaste is really spectacular though, subtle roasty coffee, hint of sour cream, balanced spicy dry wood and bourbon with just a lingering pleasant hotness.  This seems a bit more viscous than I remember, soft light carbonation, thick and viscous but not sticky, still super drinkable though but feels the heaviest out of the vintages Ive had.

Taste is equally as well balanced with rich dark chocolate like roasty malt, a touch of vanilla, stong oak flavor, a touch of bourbon, and bold coffee flavors and a bit of caramel.  This is really nice, and quite a bit more enjoyable than the original breakfast stout.  Medium to thick body and moderate to light carbonation.

If you want a more bourbon taste try Goose Islands offer or bourbon!  The Goose Island offering seems like bourbon was just poured into it after the fact rather than it being aged in bourbon barrels like this fine brew has. This is the best mix for my tastes.

Appearance: Pours a viscous-looking black body with a small, short-lived tan head.

Smell: Heavy aroma hits with strong notes of roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla beans, fine pipe tobacco, charred wood, and a smooth, well-aged bourbon.

Taste: Ah, the hearty, robust taste of roasted malts, dark chocolate, and strong vanilla-flavored coffee hit you immediately. A ripple of dark caramel follows. Distinct, yet subtle bourbon flavor with tastes of wood and dark brown sugar. Hint of dark fruit. Just a perfect amount of subdued sugary sweetness. Dash of coarse ground black pepper. Perhaps some mild hops along the way upon warming. Sweetish bourbon, roasty taste on the slightly warming finish. A lingering woody bourbon aftertaste.

3448,"2008-02-24",4.0,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with Photekut.  Pours black with a moderate chocolate brown head that completely disppears by mid-glass.  Lots of coffee in the aroma with notes of bourbon and chocolate as well.  More bourbon is detected in the flavor with coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt also present.  Some bitterness from the coffee kicks in after a few seconds and lingers into the swallow.  Full bodied with a definite alcohol presence.  Theres no disguising that this is high octane.

3448,"2008-02-13",3.1,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2014 Pitch black with a finger high dark tan head.  Very strong coffee ground aroma,  a bit of vanilla and toffee.  Flavor is coffee,  dark chocolate,  toffee,  vanilla,  and a just a tad bit of bourbon,  but that is a stretch even.  Amazingly hides the alcohol almost completely.  Dry,  slightly sweet finish with a little bit of carbonation.  Thick and almost chalky,  not quite.  Very enjoyable. oh hey, rerate. The coffee in this one sucks. Overly bitter, too much roast notes, and not much barrel. Too ashy as well. Decent, but wouldnt seek this one out. 2014 rerate. Lots of barrel, bad coffee, sweet, chocolate, toffee. Not grate but better than last year.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
3448,"2008-02-11",4.0,"Tasted side by side with Goose Island Bourbon County Stout.  First thought.....where is the bourbon?  Seriously, this one is so coffee dominated, I can barely pick up any alcoholic notes at all, much less bourbon.  Freshly ground coffee explodes into the nose, followed closely by dark and bitter chocolates, toasted caramel, and trace amounts of bourbon.  A quick swirl of the opaque mahogany liquid reveals moderately thick, sugary legs that leave virtually no lacing behind.  Flavors of decadent dark chocolate and rich, freshly ground coffee beans are kissed by just a touch of boozy bourbon.  The body is medium-full and very smooth, with a lingering coffee roast sticking to the roof of the mouth and the tongue for ages.  This is a very nice brew, but is it really much better than Terrapin Wake-N-Bake?  I think not.  Bourbon County Stout owns this beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3448,"2008-02-11",4.1,"Vintage 2006

Pours opaque black, with dark brown bubbles that struggle to overcome the viscous liquid.
A inverted cascade of ulta-fine carbonation swells to a half inch with an exaggerated pour.
The whipped batter lasted less than two sips and dissolved to barely a whisp on the surface.
Aromatics are pungent with heavily roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and a small dose of bourbon. 
The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and slightly grainy. Plenty of gription and cling-power.
The pallet is laden with plenty of dry, bitter, dark chocolate, black-roasted coffee grounds, oak char, and burnt malt.
Hopping is subdued, and alcohol is slightly warming.
Finishes with lingering brownie batter infused with espresso, and spiked with a hint of whiskey.

The bourbon in this beer is quite subdued and is complimentary to the coffee and chocolate.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

Pours a thin looking dark brown color with a thin, but potent looking, brown head that fades quickly. I know this a different beer than Breakfast Stout but I still get the same smell, coffee grounds. The scent gets better as it warms up but still not great. Toasted malts and alcohol as it warms. The first thing to hit my tongue is coffee grounds, but it gets better. Toasted malts and alcohol quickly drown out the taste of coffee grounds. Palate is thin, coats the mouth a bit. Nice carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"

Taste is similar and I feel some alcohol and dryness at the end.  I would say that overall it is a pretty good imperial stout but I think the bourbon and vanilla are a little too intense to my liking and tend to shadow other flavors.

The aroma has notes of roasted malt and bourbon, and I also find hints of burnt chalk. The flavour has a light sweetness, notes of hard roasted malt, chalk, bourbon, vanilla, a warming alcohol, coffee, licorice and hints of chocolate. The finish has a kind of ashy feeling to it. Its a very fascinating beer, but since I do not like a pronounced bourbon or whisky flavour - I prefer the simply divine Breakfast Stout, if I could choose.","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"

Everything about this beer is dark. Pours syrupy black with dark tan head. Head doesnt last too long but aroma is strong enough to hold. Smells very close to regular Breakfast Stout. Side by side I dont think I could tell the two apart. Taste is also similar, but as it lingers in your mouth and warms, the Bourbon flavor comes out. Not overpowering at all but very smooth. Exceptional beer. Worth the hefty pricetag in my opinion.","Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, USA","jj21"

3448,"2008-01-27",4.6,"Viscous pitch black liquid with a very thin brown head.  No lacing.

Aroma is huge coffee with hot dash of bourbon.  This is gonna carry a kick!

Tastes like one shot of espresso, one shot of melted semisweet chocolate, and one shot of bourbon.  Its got a nice heat to it that fits with the other flavors.  Finish is drier than the Sahara.

Mouthfeel is a bit hot but the dry finish takes over and makes you want more.  Drinkability is a bit hampered by the bourbon but this is still pretty smooth for 10% abv.

I feel that this is significantly different in taste but about equal in quality to the regular breakfast stout.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

3448,"2008-01-23",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2014 January 23, 2008. Bottle from franksnbeans -- thanks! Ive wanted to try this one for several years now, and tonights the night. Leo Smiths Divine Love on the stereo, I settle in and crack open the bottle within a few degrees of room temperature. It pours out into my snifter dark and beautiful, thick with vast lacing and a small dark-tan head.

Huge smoky, ashy catches me by surprise. I was expecting more vanilla, less smoke. It recalls Peche Mortel in its ashiness, but somehow it wears that ashiness much better; here I get charred hardwood and pipe tobacco rather than soggy cigarette butts. That ashy aroma dominates the nose; underneath theres a lot of interesting stuff going on, though you have to go looking for it: blackberries dipped in chocolate, peaty whisky.
Despite all of the ash I get a vinous, juicy flavor, tannic wine, berries, lots of bourbon. Bitter chocolate cake late.  Its acidic early, dry through the close; not a sweet imperial stout at all. Full, warming mouthfeel. only a hint of alcohol heat, that fascinating ashiness rising into the sinuses. 

Im not sure its right up there at the very peak of the genre -- and I dont think I enjoy the flavors quite as much as I did with the bottle of the Abyss 07 from a couple of nights ago -- but I freely admire this one as a fascinating and obviously well crafted beer.
Revisit January 8, 2014. Bottle shared with Prufrockstar and J. from untappd. Big aroma of ash and oatmeal cookie, plenty of oak, contra my original assessment Id give it at least an 8 and possibly even a 9. Flavor more or less follows, as before on the drier side, not from sharp hops but rather from the ashen malts. Id go more like 7 for the flavor. Bit of warmth on the back of the throats, rather thin-feeling for the style (compared to Abyss, Parabola, etc.) It would go about 3.8 this time but Ill let the 3.9 stand.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Looks much like a Guinness in the way that the bubbles between the liquid and the head moves around a lot, gathering momentum, enhancing the head and increasing the liquid.

After about 7 months, it seems this is a beer best enjoyed fresh (against all reason, a high-ABV, barrel-conditioned stout should really last longer). Deep inky pour with minimal head/lacing, the aroma is big and bourbon-y, natch. But the body seems to have thinned a bit much, and theres a slightly sour aftertaste.

Given the name, I was expecting a bourbon blast once the glass hit my mouth, but the barrel aging seems rather subdued.   There are so many of these big bold barrel aged stouts out there that you really have to be excellent to make any kind of impression.

3448,"2007-12-04",4.4,"This was the second time I had had the KBS, both times on tap. The first time was the Extreme Beer Fest, so I could appreciate it more this time. I had remembered it being sweeter the first time but more chocolatey this time. At any rate, I was much more impressed this time. It was served in a goblet at the brewpub.

A: Jet black body with no head. Even when held to the candle at the table, no light penetrated.

S: The smells emanating from the glass were very strong and delicious. Right up front was a ton of chocolate followed by coffee, dark fruits (dates?), some smokiness and a bit of maple syrup. All in all, it kind of smelled like a burnt mocha, but in a good way if thats possible.

T: The taste is just like the aroma, very chocolaty with coffee and some burnt sugar flavors. The smoothness and creaminess are incredible for a beer of 10% alcohol. This is definitely one of my favorite beers, although I am partial to double stouts.

M: As I said before, the creaminess and smoothness are amazing although the beer is lighter in body than it would seem. Many of these high alcohol double stouts have the same quality of only medium body.

Not quite like burnt coffee and even less pleasant;  Chocolate, caramel, chocolate chip cookie dough, toasted nuts hid behind the burnt aromas, but peak out as it warms.  Faint perfumey alcohol, moderate bourbon and lightly oaked wood notes. Vanilla gets stronger as it warms and I think Ive also gotten some faint herbal hops.  Flavor starts out acrid, burnt, and bitter the same as it does in the aroma, but thankfully not quite as intense.  Chocolate and coffee are more evenly balanced as it warmed.  Caramel, toasted malts, vanilla, light bourbon all present and accounted.  Some doughy malt aftertaste.  Semi dry finish, and the aftertaste is lightly bitter from grains & hops with a lightly burnt coffee flavor.  Smooth, creamy texture, well hidden alcohol, fuller body, and lower level of CO2.

3448,"2007-09-24",4.2,"Bottle from iowahekeye in June 2007.  Thanks.1  Pours with no head and small bubbles that fade fast.  Pitch black color.  Swirling, it seems thin.  Strong smokey, toasted and oak aromas.  Maybe even a bit of bourbon aroma, but it may be the toasted oak confusing me.  Medium body.  Not dry, but not sweet either, hmmm.  Alchohol is well hidden.  Lots of flavor of raisins, coffee, molasses, and a little roasted grains.  Gets better as it warms up.  Excellent beer even though Im not a big fan of smoky.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

A pungent aroma slowly climbs out of the glass and wafts across the room.  Rich and powerful.  Roasted malts, strong bitter coffee, light alcoolic notes and raisins.  Color is black with a light crimson ring around the top in a strong light.  Strong and flavorful.  Lots of coffee and roasted grains hit you up front.  Light alcohol presence is masked in all of the flavor.  Brown sugar, molasses and carbon mixes in mid swallow.  Burbon is present in just a touch and melds very well with the other flavors.  Finishes a little dry and bitter.  Big and powerful brew but amazingly easy drinking.  A top notch impy.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

The aroma is huge with coffee grounds first then burnt malts and hints of a barrel age odor. The taste starts with burnt malts and bourbon. Then the coffee starts to take hold followed by alcohol and wood that deliver the taste experience to the finish. Into the after taste I get sweet caramel, molasses and more coffee.

Im not picking up too many other aromas except for really strong coffee grounds, and not in an especially appealing way  and I love coffee.  The taste is better and more complex.  Thick, roasty, coffee.  The coffee taste is more fresh and appetizing than the stale coffee aroma.  I would really like to try more of this to get a more accurate opinion.  It tasted good but was not world class in my opinion.  Will reserve final judgment until I have another bottle. 

Fresh 4-pack, resampled.  The coffee this time was not stale, day old grounds but it still dominated the nose.  I can hardly get any bourbon in the aroma (or the taste for that matter).  This is not a bad beer just not that good of an example of a bourbon aged stout, especially for the price and availability.

The flavor is more enjoyable, with additions of pulpy coconut and milk chocolate. Sweetness is very high but somewhat offset by the heavy roastiness and coffee bitterness.

3448,"2007-06-29",4.2,"12oz bottle, sampled alongside the Breakfast Stout. Pours pitch black, with a short, light brown head that quickly diminishes to a thing ring of bubbles that hugs the walls of the snifter. Strong coffee aroma; with some dark chocolate, oak and vanilla. The coffee aroma is stronger here than it is in my Breakfast Stout. The coffee again defines the flavor, again with some bitter dark chocolate in the background along with caramel and burnt toast flavors. Bourbon was not as prominant as I expected. More intense than the Breakfast Stout, but still smooth and enjoyable.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"

3448,"2007-06-20",4.2,"12 ounce bottle from Beer Depot in Ann Arbor, MI (June 2007) drunk at cellar temperature from a Corsendonk glass at my parents house in southern Wisconsin.  Beautiful pour, impenetrable midnight with a chocolate-pudding head that decays slowly leaving thick dark lacing.....nose is nearly all coffee at first, surprising as usually the bourbon overpowers these things, but slowly some oaky hints, burnt caramel, and faint traces of berries show up; its assertive and different, anyway....very rich mouthfeel, somewhat dry and coffee-ground-like at first, the gritty texture giving way to velvety cakiness quickly, dark bitter chocolate infused with blueberries, and doused briefly in fairly young, harsh bourbon....bitter and long, burnt malty character runs through to the finish.  I had the feeling this would disappoint me, and it didnt actually, I find it quite interesting and different from most other BBA Imperials Ive had, the whiskey not overdone at all; that said, its a little harsh to drink with regularity so Ill probably save a bottle or two for just a little mellowing.  Perhaps not quite deserving of its praise, but not completely overrated either.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Flavor is slightly sweet malt with tones of chocolate, coffee, and with some bourbon kick, but not at all overpowering like I feared. The initial stout is somewhat subdued, more so than there regular imperial, which really allows the bourbon to come through without being overpowering. Has a noticeable alcohol character throughout. Very drinkable, complex, not overdone, really outstanding.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","ToadMan"

Not nearly as bourbony as i thought it would be either.Though that is not a negative. The body is medium. The slight sweetness and the more subtle flavors of this stout combined with not as thick a body as some make this an extremely easy drinking stout. I love imperials but cant drink them everyday.

3448,"2007-06-15",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2008 Bottle courtesy Robert at statelineliquors.com. Pour was black, nice tan chocolate had, slow/delayed developing head just like a fresh Bfast Stout, a pretty pour despite the aging. The head had good retention and great lacing, nice job, Founders! The aroma got me all excited, coffee, oak, light smoke/ash, vanilla, and bourbon, but the latter didnt overwhelm at all, just a nice beautiful coffee presence and so much other character there. Flvaor was much the same, all things melded together prefectly with a touch barrel aging, nothing dominant, a smooth treat, fabulous. Did I rate the regular breakfast stout highly enough? This stuff rocks! Thank you, my friend, Robert!!! Re-rate, September 07, bottle courtesy of nolankowal: Original rating stands, a fabulously done beer. Thanks, John! Rerate (4/08) in horizontal alongside two vintages (08 and 07) of ST Jah-va and a Peche Mortel bottle x 12oz.

Nose of a seared espresso mocha and a bourbon-soaked german chocolate cake.  Initially, an offensive one-dimensional canvas of coffee grounds skirting the surface of a bourbon pool.  With warmth, the malts and the barrel arrive hand in hand.  Dark chocolate, sultry vanilla vapors and smoke.  Smacking, soy sauce finish with a hint of wet cardboard.  The astringency of the dark roast never completely gives way.  Not artfully rendered, and quite bombastic without much of  true substance.  Age should help.

3448,"2007-05-28",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2007 Rerate 11/14/07: 6 month old bottle this time instead of nearly 2 years. Significantly thicker palate, more assertive, round and luxurious beer. Bourbon is noticeable but contained. Could definitely be a lot more roast. A very nice beer, but still dont see this as top 50 worthy. 7/5/7/5/3.7
5/28/07: 9/3/5/3/3.2: Bottle from TAR. Im pretty sure this is the new batch, so only 3 or 4 months old. Aroma is fantastic. What a tease. Pure, rich, luxurious chocolate and vanilla, oak and coffee, rich all the way through. Actually, it doesnt smell that good anymore, but that first whiff was heaven, so Ill leave it at that. Pour is very black with a small beige cap that fades to just a tiny ring. What is this I taste? Nothing, you say? Perhaps. Perhaps up front. And then bourbon. Bourbon bourbon bourbon. Why is this beer in the top 50? Or number 4 on BA? Am I crazy? Do I have a bad bottle? Its not bad, per se, its just so one dimensional. So boring. Some people seem to like the thin palate (""drinkable,"" Ive seen) but I think it is just weak. You cant put this beer up against Speedway or DL or even Storm King. Or its little cousin Breakfast Stout, for that matter. Its just... not well made. Ill definitely have to give this another shot, though; I just cant believe that this is the best this beer can be.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

A faint bourbon linger sneaks up on me like a some crazy ninja would, being very subtle but lethal.  Viscous mouth feel that holds tight throughout.  A malty, brown sugar and vanilla start finishes into fine coffee/espresso with just enough of a bourbon taste that doesnt overpower it.  Very fine brew, Im just pleased I was able to get my hands on a couple of bottles. 9-5-9-5-19

Re-Rate:  Draft at the brewery pours a pitch, midnight black with a medium-sized rocky, tan head.

Aroma reminds me of a strong cup of french vanilla coffee with a hint of bourbon.  The taste is quite similar, although I pick up a subtle sweetness, a stronger bourbon flavor, and chocolate.  It is rather light on the palate and is very satisfying.  Would work well as a coffee alternative (for a more exciting work day...).  I prefer this over the regular fouders breakfast stout.

Note for 2009 batch:  After tasting the latest release, I found that the flavors and aromas of coffee and the accompanying bitterness are much more pronounced, with less vanilla.  It is still an excellent brew but I prefer the previous batch.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"

Kentucky Breakfast Stout pours black as night. Visocus body that gurgles into my snifter. A chocolate half finger head formed on the pour that faded to a ring. The ring leaves ringed lacing after each drink. Very handsome beer.

Big notes of coffee and vanilla. This beer absolutely makes my mouth water. Mild bourbon and oak. The coffee smells freshly brewed and hot. This very easily could be the best smelling beer Ive ever had the opportunity to smell.

The flavor is as good as the smell. One of the best beers Ive ever tasted. Starts off with freshly brewed coffee and cream. Mild vanilla up front. Mid palate the coffee gets stronger and is accompanied by hazelnut, a splash of bourbon, and even a little hop spiciness. Excellent!

Mouthfeel is perfect. Thick and creamy body. Sluggish carbonation lets the beer work through my mouth velvety smooth.

There is no doubt about this beer beeing a sipper but its one that I could sip from the moment I rolled out of bed until I fell back asleep.

This is one special brew. I wasnt sure if this would live up to all the talk or not. It lives up to and surpasses the talk. One of the best beers Ive expierenced in my drinking days. Exceptional!

Color is insane, a black hole from which light cannot escape.  And holy cow the viscosity of this beer is high, you can tell when you swish it.

3448,"2007-05-14",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2007 I am in generally, not a fan of barrel aged beers, but this is really remarkable.  Pours a black to immensely dark dark brown (near motor oil) with a razor thin light brown to dark tan head.  The nose is very woody.  A little char.  Some subdued vanilla underneath the coffee and slight hint of alcohol.  A little floral fruity overtone.  Not that big cloying sweet syrupy mess I find in most bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts.  Thick and rich in the mouth.  Great big viscosity, one could cut this beer with a knife.  Nicely subdued carbonation.  With every sip, I enjoy this beer more.  Big and sweet rich malt.  Vanilla, oak, char, really come through, but meet the rich dark chocolate and expresso halfway.  None of this club you over the head with the barrel nonsense.  Even the bit of diacetyl lends a nice buttery note that well compliments the bourbon.  A bit sweet slightly buttery almost cherry-like finish with some more wood, a bit of smoke, char, and even some acidity coming in the later aftertaste.  Then its all wood, but not tannic.  Not too bourbon soaked either.  Just appropriate.  Man, for half the price, Id buy a case.  Maybe Ill settle for another 4 pack. Chocolate really comes on in the nose as this warms up.  I think I may have understated the smoke.  Not that it was particularly strong, but it was there.  Man theres a lot in this here beer.

Im just updating this after having sat on this for almost 6 months.  Everything about this beer is very similar.  The aroma is sweeter with a mocha coffee.  Just so smooth, I couldnt help but boost the aroma a point.

Burned but not quite tarry, with faint dark chocolate.  Deft touch of oak and vanilla, but a deep inhalation brings out the distinct, strongly bourbonous totality.  Opaque motor oil pour with a dark brown, creamy head.  Creamy full mouthful, velvety smooth.  Robust flavor, roast coffee, dark chocolate, wood, strong vanilla.  Pleasantly warming.  Much gentler and rounded than the somewhat brutal Breakfast Stout.  Bourbon notes increasingly revealed with every sip.  Lots of malt here and only light bitterness.  Medium saltiness.  Aftertaste is long and distinct.  Though rich and delicious, I still think I prefer the ""normal"" powerhouse, though only slightly.... [4.1]Same batch, some months later: oh, man, this is a beast!

World class.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"
3448,"2007-04-27",4.5,"I tasted this at a beerfest in Boston.  All told, i must have tried over 25 beers that afternoon.  Kentucky Breakfast was one of the first I tried and set an impossible standard to live up to for the rest.  Its silky smooth chocolate entrance is complemented perfectly with the bitter coffee and bourbon aftertaste.  One of the best stouts available.  Every bourbon should be mixed with beer!","Troy, New York, USA","ArcaneApollo"

This allusive beer poured an almost opaque black body, creamy and rich, the head also sits a dark khaki, tall and sturdy. The aroma is bold with suggestions of vanilla, chocolate and no way of omitting that heavy handed pour of bourbon. The flavor brings more of the same, with some coffee bitterness and hints of an oaky vinous character. The palate is superb chewy and velvety smooth, absolutely wonderful! 
However in the end, Im left thinking that the Bluegrass State should do what they do best, race horses and serve up whisky drinks like old-fashioneds, mint juleps, or go bold and drink it straight up, but bourbon in my stout Thats just not my thing!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
3448,"2007-04-26",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2007 Wow I finally got to experience this lovely stout!  Deep drown color, pours almost like maple syrup, medium beige head -  very creamy and nice lacing.  Aroma of dark roasted coffee, bourbon, oak, with a slight hint of sweetness.  Wonderfully rich and satisfying flavors, coffee, earthy malt, oak, maple syrup, caramel, bready yeast.  Just all sorts of things to please your palate!","Ephrata, Pennsylvania, USA","tbookman"
3448,"2007-04-25",3.9,"From the notch on the front label, Im guessing that this was bottled in late 2006, from a stubby twist-off 12 oz. bottle, sampled at room temperature in a snifter.

Poured a syrupy blackish dark coffee brown with a frothy, creamy, bubbly topped brown head, good retention, small amount of laced sticking.

Big earthy expresso nose with milk chocolate, vanilla, a subtle sweet fruitiness, a pronounced green oak woodiness, and a light charcoal.

Good even moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, silky slick, creamy smooth, airy, full bodied mouthfeel.

A pleasant sipper, earthy expresso and coffee beans, grainy, caramel, green wood, hints of charred embers and oily smoke, vanilla, the alcohol is well masked and provides a low warmth in the palate, the hops are buried and soft, and a dry bitter coffee and licorice finish.

This is pretty good, but for the price and taste, I think I prefer the regular Breakfast Stout.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"
3448,"2007-04-25",4.1,"What a pleasant surprise.  The name made me think maybe this was somekind of hillbilly joke, but it is actually a wonderful desert beer.  Coffee and chocolate notes, like a Bells Expedition Stout, with a great alcohol warmth and a bourbon note that actually works.  The general effect of using a whiskey bottle to age beer is usually nasty, destroying all subtlety, but this does add to the intensity and complexity of the beer.  Very dark, almost opaque, small dark head.  Nose announces the flavor well.  Even a good hoppy finish.  Just great.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
3448,"2007-04-23",4.0,"Aroma is roasted coffee and caramel.  Pours a very dark brown with a small delicious dark brown head.  Appearance and aroma alone are very enticing.

Ive had bourbon, whiskey, barrel aged stouts- the thing that distinguishes this one is that usually the barrel aging provides a decidedly addiditive characteristic that can be separated out and identified. The KBS barrel aging is so intricitely woven throughout that it cannot be isolated unalloyed from the rest of this magnificiently constructed beer.

3448,"2007-04-22",4.2,"Bottle from a 4-pack (thanks Artusory!). Pours an opaque black/brown with a quickly fading brown head that leaves a constant ring around the glass. Earthy potting soil and rich coffee is propelled up to your nostrils by a gust of bourbon. Flavor has notes of ultra-rich chocolate, oak, bourbon-drenched soil, roasty coffee, dark caramel sweetness and ends with a twinge of tropical fruit. The body, although full, is surprisingly of medium consistency with a rolling fine-beaded carbonation. Everything from Founders is just classic.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
3448,"2007-04-22",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2007 Blackened body with a remarkably velvety mocha-brown head. Aroma of top quality premium dark chocolate and fresh roasted espresso bean with subtle bourbon and charred oak in the background. Great coffee, vanilla and dark chocolate characters with tons of sparkling vitality, like a juiced up version of the standard breakfast stout.  Velvety and ultra smooth with medium oatmeal starch qualities. Rich, complex and decadent. This is the first new (to me) imperial stout to really reach out and grab me in a long time.  Excellent beer. So rich and decadent, but when you want that in the form of an imperial stout, this is spot on.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
3448,"2007-04-21",4.4,"Beer pours jet black with a reddish brown head that quickly dissipates. Strong roasted malt scents mix with a sweet chocolatey aroma. The first taste brings vanilla followed by roasted coffee beans. The beer is not as thick as one might expect from the flavor and aroma. As the beer warms the vanilla aroma is more evident. This beer has a little more sweet flavor to it than their regular breakfast stout which helps to round out the roasted flavors and also helps to accentuate the vanilla flavor. Very well balanced and highly drinkable.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","hoppymeal"
3448,"2007-04-20",4.7,"this is an amazing beer overall I couldnt be happier. It is thick like a melted choclate shake in your mouth. its chocolaty, smoky, bitter, malty, every thing I could hope for it was. this was a treat.

3448,"2007-04-20",4.4,"Fresh 07 bottle. Pours a deep, dark brown  - almost black and a little oily. A light brown head foams up about a half-inch, but diminishes quickly. Some of it clings to the glass and provides a nice lacing effect, though - something I find in most Founders beers. Similar to the regular breakfast stout in aroma with big chocolate malts and dark roasted coffee at the forefront with a faint smokieness of wood and bourbon in the background. Huge coffee flavor still dominates, but is smoothed out and creamier with hints of vanilla. Extremely balanced, smooth and slightly chewy on the palate with just moderate amounts of carbonation. The bourbon really makes more of a presence as the beer warms, but it still maintains its incredible balance and smoothness. Very, very drinkable and some of the coffee bitterness has mellowed. I really like what the wood did for this one. Definitely a beer that lives up to its reputation. Im glad I have more and some in the cellar from last years batch.","San Diego, California, USA","alohaC"

3448,"2007-04-19",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2010 2007 bottle.  Pour is nice, rich black with chestnut tones, beautiful creamy copper head.  Aroma is weak, just as the Founders Imperial Stout...coffee grounds and not much else.  A little something else, maybe oak.  Flavor is not bad at all; creamy, balanced, and works a nice progression of flavors on the tongue.  Bubbles and chocolate up front, then alot of coffee, then nice oak and bourbon on the finish.  About what I expected: very good for a ""coffee"" Imperial Stout, but inherently limited in that it doesnt go much beyond that.
EDIT******************************9/2/2010  My tastes have changed a bit in the past few years, and I got some new bottles of this so I have to change the review a bit.  What I perceived as singularity and one-dimensionality 3 years ago now I understand as being a honed-in, straightforward but delicious expression of a lightly oaked bourbon coffee stout.  Nose is mostly coffee grounds but some light bourbon tones, mouthfeel is so rich and full, flavors are lively, oak and bourbon play well with the charred coffee.  Entering new numbers for this now.  Not overly complex but excels at what it does.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
3448,"2007-04-19",4.5,"Bottle. Thanks to Puddintane for sending me this. Dark black pour - sludge, oily thick with a very thin head.  This was so dark black that I could see my reflection when looking at it from above. 

Heavy coffee aroma, bitterness. Malty with some chocolate tones.

First taste: bitter coffee taste mixed with some chocolate, warming up the alcohol, mellowing out to the vanilla bourbon taste that nearly came out of no where. Wow!
Lite mouthfeel considering the thickness that this beer poured. 

As it warmed and I take more sips I start to notice the low level of carbonation and the subtle tones of sugar being present. The vanilla flavor of the bourbon is so smooth in this stout that it is a perfect example of a barrel aged beer. Had a very nice warming feeling to it. As it warmed I got some lite wood aroma; as it warmed more and towards the bottom of the snifter, I got alot more bourbon being detected. 

One of the smoothest and well balanced Imperial Stouts I ever had!","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","jason"
3448,"2007-04-15",3.7,"Bottle picked up by my father during his recent trip to Detroit.  Thanks Pops!  Pours black with a half inch thick light tan head that fades a bit but leaves very nice lacing around the glass lasting to the last sip. Nose is a lot of coffee, very similar to the regular breakfast stout. Bourbon aromas become evident as the beer warms, but for the most part it just coffee. Flavor is a bit more complex than the nose, bringing out much more bourbon, coffee ofcourse still there, a little vanilla and cocoa too. Wish it had more of a chocolately flavor than the coffee, but still an enjoyable sipper.  Just not my favorite type of imperial.  Will be saving a couple of these babies to see how they age.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Aroma of bourbon, oak, char and maybe molasses. Mouthfeel sort of thick but pretty smooth, a little oily. Lightly sticky. Nice fine rings of lacing. Leaves a syrupy coating inside of glass. Taste is mostly bourbon, oak and char - surprisingly rather mild-flavored and little complexity. Also surprisingly not hot at all. The char taste lingers for awhile as an aftertaste. Maybe this is better not cellared. Left me wishing there was a little more to it.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
3448,"2007-04-14",4.4,"ab fab appearance.  dark dark brown with mocha ice cream colored head.  head is thick and creamy thats long lasting.  aroma is burnt dark roast espresso and thick dark chocolate syrup.  kinda smells like java chip starbucks ice cream if youve had it.  flavor is very bourbon-y with dark espresso and dark and semi-sweet chocolates.  the mouthfeel is unbelievably smooth considering the harshness of the aroma.  like a bourbon flavored frappaccino with whipped cream and nutty roastedness.  yummy.","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"
3448,"2007-04-14",4.2,"Bottle, pours an oily black with an ample brown sugar head; minimal lacing.  Aroma in an enticing amalgam of bourbon, oak, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and a bit of cinnamon.  Taste follows nicely with more oak, vanilla, coffee, and bourbon, without overpowering everything else.  Medium to full on the palate with a a slight oily covering, nice lingering flavor.  Amazing ability to be subtle and strong at the same time.  Highly recommended.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
3448,"2007-04-14",4.2,"07 bottle.  pours like unrefined crude oil.  about a quarter/finger head of reasonably large sized bubbles, pretty dark brown, not as nice as the regular breakfast in appearance but still beautiful.  while the bottle smells of all bourbon the glass is more woody.  more coffee than chocolate, but its like a mocha.  surprising and welcome absence of a harsh smoke in the aroma.  no alcohol, very appetizing.  flavor actually doesnt have much malt sweetness, seems like most of the sweetness comes from the barrel.  theres plenty of burnt coffee flavor under the tongue that sustain well into the finish.  i think i remember the regular breakfast being a little astringent or chalky, not really getting that here.  the barrel complements it really nicely without dominating it.  for the style its actually surprisingly light on the flavor, which is strictly relative.  i wouldnt call the body thin, and in fact i actually kinda like the colossal drinkability.  beers like this its hard to have more than maybe a snifters worth, but i could probably drink a couple of these.","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"

Well notable oak features in the flavour as well. A bit peppery and fiery. Oily, smooth almost a bit numbing mouthfeel with a medium to full body. Light to medium bitter with a tiny sweetness.

Certainly I thought God did not destin me to drink this, but alas andrew comes through.  Thick black in appearance with a tan ring of a head.  The aroma is not dominated by bourbon as I though but mostly, toffee and coffee.   Chocolate and stale cigarettes come through as well with surpisingly no bourbon in the nose.  Creamy and a medium full body.  Toffee, chocolate, coffee are the strong flavors with some light bourbon undertones that barely come through and complement it pretty well.

All I have got to say is that either I got a bad bottle or they used some cheap  bourbon barrels, ( I like jack and I do like bb beers) unless this did not age well or like I said I might have gotten a bad bottle.now the rating. poured  black with a tan head that didnt last long. aroma cocoa alcohol, coffee, smoke,did get some vanilla. flavor a nasty bourbon, ash tray, some coffee, the chocolate come out at the very end. I went looking for this beer today to buy a 4 pack at my favorite beer store and they didnt have any I am glad they didnt.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","walleye"

As I pull the glass close to my nose to take a wiff of the air, I notice a ton of smell in there: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a presence of alcohol, smell, probably the bourbon barrel aging. The taste is much the same, roasty, coffee, vanilla, chocolate. As I continue to drink, the vanilla and bourbon flavors really start to pull through this beer. This one is a bit sticky, but definetly good. This is excellent, I wish I could get more.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","cewldre"

The pour was a beautiful black with a tan thin head that left quickly. The aroma was coffee and bourbon.

Taste is like drinking a chocolate cake, coffee is also noticeable with so roasted nuts on the back end.  Very malty and definitely something that you need to try at least once.  I think this stuff is definitely better than their regular breakfast stout.  Thick, viscous, and overall a kick ass Stout.  Great work Founders!!!","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","demitriustown"

Coffee, caramel, bitter hops, chocolate covered dried cherries, just so much going on.  Great mouthfeel, full bodied and very viscious.  Ohhh this stuff is great.

3448,"2007-03-21",4.4,"12oz bottle.  Aroma:  Coffee just jumps out of the glass.  Cream, tobacco smoke, vanilla, rich chocolate, light oak.  Bourbon is there but snakes its way subtly through the beer.  Wow.  Appearance:   Dark and oily looking black with no highlights.  Dark tan head was small, foamy, and fleeting.  Not much lacing.  Flavor:  Again, the coffee just pushes to the front with its richness.  Dark chocolate, smoke, vanilla, light toasted nuts, oak.  The bourbon is balanced very nicely. It adds some flavors and richness, but doesnt overwhelm.  Finishes somewhat dry, but roasted grains and coffee linger after the finish. Palate:  Full bodied and creamy.  Moderate carbonation.  Strong alcohol warming in back of mouth and down throat.   Overall:  Great, great beer.  Smooth, rich, and very satisfying.  The subtlety of the bourbon flavors was terrific.  Only complaint is that the alcohol is a bit hot at times.  But thats a small complaint against everything else they did well here.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","RagallachMC"

The aroma met me half way: strong coffee, chocolate, and smoky wood.  I couldnt wait for the first taste.  It did not disappoint.  The coffee/espresso, roasted malt, and chocolate dominate however they are not alone.  The bourbon and alcohol flavors are present along with more subtle vanilla and dark fruit flavors.  Full bodied which leaves a fairly strong coffee taste in the mouth.

3448,"2007-03-05",3.6,"2/3/07.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, shared from tasting at KAMEs house from RateBeer 2/3/07.  Dark black-brown in color with a frothy, soapy head.  Lacing is pretty slight as the head dissipates rather quickly.  Nose is richly layered with bold burnt coffee and a decadent vanilla-fudge combo, but there are also huge swaths of alcohol boozing it up all over the place.  Huge pepper taste with a violently numbing dark bourbon smack.  Incredibly bold, strong chocolate-covered espresso bean taste, smothered over an interesting but fairly subdued ashy smoke flavor.  Too much bourbon for my money, and Im usually a sucker for strong-flavored beers.  Some black cherries in the finish.  Alcohol is slightly numbing, and theres a little bit of black scalded coffee acidity that comes off in the mouthfeel as well as the flavor.  Full-to-medium-full body.  Way too much for me, even if the intensity demands respect.  Just not something I can see drinking very often.  The creamy smooth goodness in the regular Breakfast Stout (probably attributed to the oatmeal) is mostly stripped down here (as if with paint thinner) by the shrieking alcohol, bourbon, and espresso intensity.  Theres just none of the elegance and subtlety that the regular Breakfast Stout has-- its as if they made a ridiculously over-the-top version of that, an already badass beer, but one that was wonderfully balanced in its strength.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

This the first brew I have consumed in my new home, the first brew consumed in a home I own, and I wanted it to be special.  I really tried hard to trade for this for a while and happily Nathan came through for me.  Pours a rich black with a nice dark brown head that quickly went away into a ring.  The head is certainly not as pronounced or bold as the non bourbon version, but the color was similar.  The aroma is rich and chocoolaty and smells a bit like chunky peanut butter.  There also notes of smoke and coffee.  This is a serious smell, yummy.  The tastes is robust malty, smokey and strong.  The vanilla, coffee, and chocolate all come through, not as chocolately as Founders other Breakfast Stout, but equally good.  Damn this is one hell of an amazing beer, it is really spectacular.

4/13/07, re-rate of a 2007 bottle (very fresh). All i can think of is, ""Wheres the beef...i mean....bourbon? Yes, Wheres the bourbon?"". No bourbon in the nose and barely noticed in the flavor. A lot less than last year and I found last years to be subtle. What happened here?? This taste like regular Breakfast Stout, lots of stale coffee and cigarettes. i wonder if they reused the same barrels as last years so there just less bourbon notes. still tasty but i prefer last years batch. rating changed, 7/5/8/4/15=3.9. 

12/12/07, 2005 vintage, cellar aged almost 3 years. still lots of coffee and dark chocolate in the aroma for this. flavor has silky chocolate, ash, lots of coconut, some wood, and sweet vanilla. bourbon notes dont come through at all. a bit thin and silky feel. this as mellowed a bit with age but it hasnt changed much. i dont think more age will improve this. this is still nice BA imperial stout but as barrel aging fad roars on, this is no longer special as there are many more done better than this.3.9. 

3/26/08, 2008 vintage, fresh bottling. pours black with small tan head around the rim. a wonderful nose of freshly ground coffee, smoke, coconut, and vanilla. flavor is however a bit coffee roast harsh and ashy. some chocolate in the finish. the profile just isnt smooth and not alcohol or bourbon harshness but more roast and ash as its a little rough around the edges. some buttery bourbon notes are barried underneath but are rather underdone. a full smooth mouth feel and carbonation. a nice beer that is worty of a solid 4 from me.4.0.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Aroma still had that used coffee grounds aroma but with it there was the bourbon to help balance things out, along with a touch of vanilla. Still hard to overcome that used coffee grounds.

This ring initially provides a foam line or two, but shortly thereafter only a few flecks of lace. The aroma is fantastic - tons of roasted malt, charred oak, coffee, and chocolate covered cherry.

Bold flavors of burnt coffee, bitter roasted malt, and charred smoky oak. And bourbon. And raisin. And leather. And molasses. And maduro cigar wrapper. Full body, the carbonation is gentle, but definately not lacking. Burnt raisin, bourbon, oak, and Honduran cigar smoke linger in the aftertaste.

Smell; the bourbon is definitely present, but its not overwhelming, and mixes very well with the coffee aromas. Theres a bit of chocolate in there, as well a bit of dark fruits that just barely seep through.

Taste; whoa, that bourbon flavor is first to hit, but boy is it really smooth. The bourbon fades nicely into a very rich chocolate espresso topped with cherries. The alcohol is felt with a mild warming in theback of my throat. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and velvety, and about as good as it gets.

My initial aroma reaction upon cracking the twist off was that this brew smelled like a smoked slim jim, which didnt get me off to a promising start.  Upon deeper meditation, Im realizing its actually more weighted toward raw bourbon, burned Starbucks coffee, and a hint of char.  The mouthfeel is a pleasant surprise after the disappointing aroma; rich and creamy and brimming with bourbony vanilla notes.  Creamy dark chocolates, roasted coffee, ash, and far too much bourbon for my palate to decipher.

Slow and sticky legs linger when swirled, yet surprisingly little lace is produced. I leave the room for awhile and return to find a huge aroma that literally meets me at the door. Like a <a href=www.ratebeer.com/><a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons showdown, a fat (yet muscular) whisky character grapples for dominance with a hefty helping of coffee roasts. Deeper investigation reveals peppery hops and juicy dark fruits. A thick, silky mouthfeel is a lazy river to a languid riverboat of flavor. Tastes like the coffeepots been on the stove all day but a square of dark chocolate cuts the bitterness. Alcohol returns late as a backwash through the sinuses to wake you up... as if the coffee hasnt already. Flavors linger with a hint of burnt sourness, but another sip washes it back away to the thick bittersweetness of moccaccino. It was a real pleasure drinking this Top 50 beer, now stand back as I turn up my speakers (Rating #1300)...

3448,"2006-11-09",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2008 Ah, KY Breakfast, at long last, we meet. Courtesy of Muenster. The pour is super opaque red/black with a very small brown head that can be stirred up from time to time. Swirling the glass leaves some spotty, oily lacing. The nose is potent and mouthwatering. Hints of faint cigarette smoke, toasted oats, vanilla, chocolate, cookies, all lurk within the complex, robust aroma. The mouthfeel isnt all that heavy for an impy stout, but thats not saying its thin by any means at all. The carbonation is right on for the flavor profile: minimal. Ah, the flavor is even better. This is the regular Breakfast stout (delicious) times two with the addition of creamy, charred, vanilla sweetness. The initial flavor is smoky with a wallop of oats and fresh coffee, this fades to a smoother profile akin to the woody, semi-sweet taste of Kentucky sippin whisky, and finally the finish lingers like a spoonfull of delicious coffee ice cream. An ashy character is noted at any stage in the tasting process and really holds the whole brew together. Not only is this absolutely delicious, but its unique. I could pick this one out in a line up of a dozen others in the style, yet at the same time it still satisfies my craving for a hearty impy stout.

Pours extra black with a very small, dark tan head. Ive been desperately trying to revisit this one and Iowaherkeye hooked me up! The aroma is pretty good: smoky, vanilla-infused bourbon, but not overdone at all. Huge amounts of oats and chocolate are also present. Some soy sauce is also noted. Anxiously taking a sip, my anticipation is quelled. This stuff is absolutely delicious. The bourbon character is tremendously tasteful. It only highlights and balances the strong, ashy toasted oat flavor. Thick, bittersweet chocolate lingers on the palate, giving this a delightful dessert quality. The brew improves twofold when it warms. Very complex, very rich, very balanced. This is one of my all time favorites.  Ive become a little more skeptical about barrel-aged brews after sampling so many, but this one is flawlessly done.

[September 9, 2008]

Bottle huge thanks to Hopdog. This is consistently one of my favorite beers. I mean, it’s so good. My brain tells me that I seriously love this beer but I forget just how good it tastes. I’m so glad to revisit it and reaffirm my complete obsession with this nectar of the gods. The pour is black and thick with a nice looking tan head that fades away pretty quick. It’s not the blackest of the black, but it’s certainly visibly an imperial stout. The aroma. Oh God, the aroma. It smells so good. Fresh, sharp, defined, roasty coffee, toasted oats, bourbon, ash, slight vanilla-esque tannins. The bourbon barrel aging on this is remarkably tasteful. It merely adds a rounded sweetness and does not interfere with any of the roasty, sharp qualities. Coffee is in full effect in the flavor, but doesn’t dominate the vanilla, wood smoke, or chocolate flavors. This is just stunningly appealing to me. Damned good beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Coffees on! Wonderfully well rounded aroma of fresh roasted coffee with a vanilla mocha twist and a slight tender pull of chocolate chip waffles.

Black breakfast in a glass. Much like the origianl BK stout but with a hearty warming of deep dark earthy roasted stuff. Vanilla, coffee, roast, earth, slight charred edging along some thick Belgian waffles, touch of buttercream, chocolate drizzled, and oh so lovingly warm. Something to wake up for indeed. Like a huge waffle breakfast when your eyes are bigger then your stomach and the coffee is just right and the syrup fills every square just right. The finish is the capper as it rounds around with a chocolatey warming and a perk of roast and fluff lingering. Puffy chocolate remains on the cheeks and floats like hand whipped cream.

Total breakfast feel. Fulfilling & without much effort to do so. Warming, smooth, delicate, sensationable, oozing the form of easy going syrup with enough thickness to soak into the pores of the waffle and drench the buds in flavor as the thickness settles and warms the belly, much like a good breakfast should.

I would love to have this stuff for breakfast every day. Although a few of these first thing at the crack of dawn and I may be napping through lunchtime. Is there a lunch stout?

I have not cracked any of my bottles open yet, but since it was on tap I
   figured I would give this one a shot.  If nothing else, it might confirm that
   I should hang on them or trade them all away.  It turns out to be the case
   that the truth is in between - it did not blow me away but at the same time
   it was a nice beer.
Aroma / Appearance - Coffee, muted bourbon notes, raisins, plums and
   smoke complete the nose.  It smells far less like hot black coffee than the
   regular Breakfast Stout but it still packs quite a punch.  The head was a
   dirty mocha color that lingered over the black body.  Eventually some scents
   of vanilla and oak made their way into my nose as I prepared to take the
   first sip.
Flavor / Palate - Expresso, bourbon, vanilla, oak, plums, malts and
   smoke were evident in the first few sips.  Unlike the aggressive coffee
   taste of the Breakfast Stout, this was strong yet not overpowering.  I felt
   it might have been a little thin but the flavors are well balanced.  The
   aftertaste comes across chocolately with a slight sweetness before finishing
   with some smoky notes.  Very enjoyable - if I could rate it more precisely

Dark black opaque small light tna head. Huge coffee and vanilla well complented by chocoalte and vanilla.

3448,"2006-07-10",4.7,"Bottle from my number one fan, TAR.
Poured a complete pitch black with a head of orange that required some coaxing from me to appear. I held this to my nose and said aloud, damn, thats a lot of coffee. Then I had to fight past that to see what else was there, but I have to admit I had fears this may be another peche mortel for me, well see. A lot of alcohol in the nose with a light wood and cocoa flavor. Viscous. Damn it is chewy, but I am smiling because it is not the coffee bomb I was afraid of. Its one of those that makes a man with a moustache happy, flavor savor, in the non ot-d way. Yes, there is a lot of coffee going on here, but there is a nice bittersweet cocoa, light alcohol bite, toffee, oh yes, buttery toffee, and it is glorious. O/k/ I just pounded the bottom of the bottle to make sure every damn drop got in my glass. I love the way the barrel flavor remains in the background and accents the beer, not dominate, although it does show itself a bit more in the finish than anywhere else. This is the kind of beer I needed to restore my love of stouts. There is a pepper flavor, not the heat but the flavor that reminds me of cayenne, and it is so damn good I want to punch someone in the face (please dont make me explain this). All I can say is I would do bad things to people I care about for this beer, it is that good. thanks for the bottle, Jeff,  you know I love ya man. Hell, I love everyone after this beer, well, almost everyone.

3448,"2006-06-25",2.7,"I feel really bad about having opened this bottle.  I mean, I can see why for some people this beer would be sublime, and yet, for me, I couldnt drink it.  I feel guilty for having deprived somebody else of the experience in drinking this, since I did not appreciate it.  Anyway, it pours black as night, and with a little coaxing offers up a small tan head.  The aroma is complex, but the primary note for me was char.  i got some of the bourbon and a hint of vanilla and other stout aromas, but the char from the bourbon barrels is what took over for me.  It, unfortunately, reminded me of burnt cardboard.  In the mouth, it was lusciously thick, with just the right amount of carbonation.  The flavor was again dominated by the char, which for me was overpowering.  The aftertaste was very interesting: earthy, sweet, vanilla, bourbon, smoke.

3448,"2006-06-12",4.5,"Received from BA orbitalr0x as part of BIF 33, this much anticipated beer came in a stubby bottle with a label design reminiscent of bygone time.  When poured, the deep brown opaque body aided by a mocha colored, one finger thick, foamy head was inviting and imposing at the same time.  The aroma was heavily laden with dark roasted coffee and freshly hewn oak.  I took a half a point off for the smell being a little too acrid, and lacking either the chocolate or dark fruit undertones of other imperial stouts.  The taste was naturally coffee driven as well, with the Bourbon barrel aging providing a smoother, and drier feel than was expected in a stout of this strength.  The vanilla like oak tannins and the substantial hop and roast grain bitterness came through much clearer towards the end of each sip, before being subdued by the eventual warmth of the peppery ethanol.  The mouthfeel was abundantly thick and just a hair short of chewy.  The hefty punch of alcoholic strength made this a fine late night digestif, but detracted from the drinkability a little.  If you drink this at breakfast, call in sick and go back to bed till noon.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Just to much of everything for any bourbon to come through. The taste is heavy coffee mocha and as you start swallowing,that bourbon taste starts becoming evident. Very full bodied,a perfect balance of bourbon aging,just a touch to much coffee to get a perfect score.

3448,"2006-04-23",4.2,"Bottled - Sometimes, when you take a great beer and age it in a boubon barrel, the magic of the original is lost - this is not the case here - the breakfast stout, in all its glory, is enhanced by a mild whiskey, wood and vanilla/cream flavor - not overpowering in the slightest - an elegant barrel-aged beer, which is a rare thing indeed - however, it is not really different enough from the original to justify the nearly doubled price tag.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

Perhaps it is because they started with a great brew to begin with. I digress. Dark midnight black, some sediment, nice and opaque. Decent amount of tannish head. Smells of chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, irish creme, yum yum. Taste is a lot of dark cocoa powder and a hint of good bourbon. Vanilla comes into play, with a nice malty finish. The bourbon is not overpowering, like others. Solid.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"

The aroma is mild bourbon (not at all any alcoholic burn, much more flavorful), coffee, chocolate, with some sweet caramel in the background along with some roasted malt, barley, and toffee.  Taste is coffee, charred wood, but very much in an aged and milder sort of way, bourbon (not burning and over-the-top, but a nice mild flavor that helps to cut through the coffee), chocolate, bakers chocolate, roasted malt, charred oak, some light tannins, vanilla, and milk chocolate with a bourbon center.  There is a bit of pepper in the flavor as well.  Full bodied, medium carbonation, finishes with some alcoholic bourbon notes (ok it finally comes out in the finish), roasted coffee, roasted malt, and oak.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

3448,"2006-04-21",3.8,"At long last I am finally able to rate this but from a bottle and served in my Expedition snifter: Pours a ebony hue with a fading tan head whose ring left excellent lace upon the glassware. The aroma has the expected coffee aroma as well as that bourbon characteristics of wood, vanilla, and alcoholic vapor. Some additional notes of toasty malt, tar, and pipe tobacco.  The taste starts with a huge portion of coffee flavors wrapped by the bourbon cask. Much of the softer chocolate tones are missing replaced by more vanilla. The finish is sharp and a tad rough but smooths out just in time. Hints of pepper and oak last on the aftertaste. The feel is bold and brash but ultimately needed more body to carry off a top notch rating.

Starting with the uncharacteristically witty notes on the label this was a great experience.   It pours out a thick black with a cocoa-colored head of modest proportions.  Aroma of coffee mingles with vanilla, bakers chocolate, oak, coconut, and bourbon.  Medium to full bodied and a smooth texture that lacked a bit of thickness.  The flavor was rich and deep, well-representing the array of aromas that began the tasting process.  The coffee, chocolate, and bourbon blend nicely in the taste.

Black with no head. Nose is strong with coffee and is fairly one sided. The taste is mostly coffee with just a hint of smoke, vanilla and bourbon. This becomes much more present as the beer warms up. In fact, had I not been drinking this slowly I am afraid that I would have missed a lot of the subtleness that exists. Overall pretty darn good, I would like to see more of the bourbon but I guess that is just the way that this is because of the coffee used.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
3448,"2006-04-10",2.8,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2008 12 Oz Bottle at the Michigan House - Calumet, MI Rich fresh aroma of sultry aged kentucky bourbon with soda and a heap of coffee grains that have been run through in a percolator. Warm, and strong. Pour of oil black, with a solid rim of frothing espresso cream. Flavor is primarily and only coffee. The sensation of pure raw bourbon aged in french oak blended with decaf coffee grounds sitting in an old aluminum giant coffeemaker cannot escape me. Church Coffee! Mouthfuls and mouthfuls of acidic, searing, half-burnt, dusty bad tasting coffee that eats at the base of your teeth.  Harsh and hot. There is no beer flavor in this at all. Two dimensional. Good Bourbon and Bad Coffee.
Re-rate. This is just as coarse and horrible as I remember it. The aroma is of bad burnt coffee grounds. Flavor is a shocking, clashing bad bitter coffee and hot bourbon. Somewhere, hops come in and confuse the picture. One of the worst uses of a barrel and most unbalanced beers I can recall. Ratebeerians should be embarrassed that this is in the Top 50.
Re-rate2008 12oz Bottle. Dirty church coffee mold, stale cadbury truffles and less bourbon. Still not a good nose. Figure coffee out. Brown-black with a rim in off-white. Flavor in this batch has a little more composure, but it’s still pretty coarse with hot Jim Beam up front, dry oak, coarse coffee grains and too much Roasted Barley. A lot of dry, leafy hops confusing. Palate is okay. This is an improvement, but it’s still rather ugly.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3448,"2006-04-09",3.8,"Pours black...and has a fastly diminishing mocha head...thick lacing.  Aroma is monster coffee...even more so than the regular breakfast if I remember correctly.  Hints of wood, a bit of bourbon (the only trace of it in the entire brew) burnt bitter sweet chocolate, and grapenut malt.  Flavor has a surprising amount of fruity ester sweetness...some vinegar as well.  Big coffee, some heavy cream and vanilla, tannic bitterness,  burnt chocolate...and I little bit of oak.  As far as barrel aging goes...well I dont get much bourbon or wood in the flavor...I guess I get some vanilla.  Compared to the original breakfast...this is much better, but I havent had that for a good while.  So...I guess Im not really sure what I think about this brew...but a a 4.13 seems a bit generous.    Mouthfeel is dense syrupy monster.  Like an oil slick in the mouth...though very acidic.","","CMUBEERMAN"
3448,"2006-04-06",4.3,"Black coffee pour with a mocha colored, creamy head.  Fresh coffee dominates the nose, but secondary notes of oak and vanilla do squeak through.  Full mouthfeel is oily slick, but never too sweet or cloying.  The great thing about the body is that keeps evolving from first sip to far past the finish.  Starts with an upfront wall of java, moving to a woody and smokey middle and finishing with bourbon and sweet chocolate.  The alcohol warms my stomach and the bourbon lingers on the tongue.  Oh boy, this is good stuff.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"
3448,"2006-04-06",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2008 Lighter shade of black. Scattered later of creamy, fine-bubbled cappuccino foam. Surface notes of coffee, tar, and burnt malt comprise the aroma. Underlying vanilla, tannins, and perfumey bourbon. Dense bubbles softly massage the palate. Oily. Onset of beautifully tight and understated tannins immediately penetrate the tarry body. Deeply rooted nutty and earthy coffee flavors exude firmly beneath the surface, but no acridness is discernable. Very bright/clean bourbon character provides a gentle tingle and harmonizes with the silky tannins, which briefly lift the sweetness from the tongue. No huskiness or overt vanillin sweetness from the barrel, at all. And the tannins are so soft, they never amplify the alcohol. Thickset tandem of cakey malts and chocolate fudge reinforce the body and soften the tannic acid as dried plums highlight the crunchy char grit. Tannins and roast induced acidity eventually succumb to everlasting flavors of dry, oaky char and rich coffee. Although not a world beater, this totally defied my expectations of finding something crowded and oversweet. What I got instead was something remarkably gelled and pleasingly mellow. A well constructed brew.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Black slightly syrupy pour with blossoming tan head that settles down rather quickly.

Aroma as if they bottled up a small slice of heaven (albeit a bit of backwoods heaven with banjos, few teeth, and perhaps a bog)... rich, deeply roasted dark chocolate and Sumatra blend, caramel, molasses, and a perfectly complimentary aire from the barrel treatment (luscious vanilla, oak, and sweet bourbon overtones).  All elements are expertly-blended, with nothing stealing the show.  Flavors began with strong roasted dark malts (same coffee and chocolate as above... coffee with slightly more prominence)... with the barrel elements emerging somewhere in the middle.  Vanilla and bourbon sweetness were well-balanced against the dark, roasty malts and coffee bitterness.  Rather heavily-bodied, yet it managed to maintain its smoothness and flow.

I know thats annoying and cliche, but damn, this is the best damn beer Ive had that I can remember.
On the pour its all motor oil, with a limp head that dies early. I figure Whiskey doesnt have a head when you pour it, so this wont have much either.
The smell is huge: coffee, whiskey, dark chocalate, english toffee, and sweet molassis. Im sure Im missing something but its just too big.
The taste is strong as hell at first. Like a meaner Breakfast stout, but it mellows and molds to a subtle and complex beer (is beer the right word?). Its got a lot of a whiskey/cognac taste in it, but that serves to temper and smooth out the coffee roast. Without becoming repetitive and long winded...this beer is f-in amazing.

As it warms, the bourbon scent becomes very strong in addition to coffee and roasted malts.  Mouth feel is very smooth with little carbonation.  Flavor at cellar temperature was a nice subtle blend of vanilla, bourbon, roasted coffee beans, and a touch of hops.  As it warmed the bourbon and vanilla flavors got to be very intense, probably too much. I had a tough time rating this one.  At cellar temp, the beer was wonderfully balanced, but once it warmed, the bourbon barrell flavor just overpowered everything else.

Dark chocolate, espresso, alcohol and bourbon are front and aromatically centered.  Singed oak casks, Tollhouse morsels, milky vanilla crème, and dark chocolate devouring hot, peppered caramel nougats.  Consequential wafts bridge the nose to mouth - brown sugar-saturated cookie dough, black malts and cinder being the most prolific.  Thick, heavy, waxy, oily wonder.  When the palate delight is able to be pushed to the side for a moment, were in the midst of bourbon, French roast espresso grinds, caramel and Madagascar vanilla seeping into flame scorched oak.  The hot alcohol tosses off the tongue.  Vibrant bakers chocolate echoes all around us, spurring Dove dark chocolates in ample supply.  A smite burn furrows on the undersides of the tongue.  Mild carbonation and a little hot, and if theres the patience and supply, itll age beautifully.

3448,"2006-03-16",3.7,"Oatmealy sweet, and with more coffee than some of its comrades such as the Central Waters Reserve. Great body, swirly head, very nice presentation. And great coffee and sweetness in the aroma, with very little bourbon intially. The flavors are like a coffee stout, like an oatmeal stout, and like a bourbon stout. Very good. But towards the end, upon full warming, there is a thinning and a rise of the bourbon that sstarts to drown out the rest and it beomes less interesting. Others will probably like that, but here the sweetness didnt work with the slight thinning and the big bourbon. Just not handled as classically as in the Central Waters though still very nice.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3448,"2006-03-16",4.1,"bottle bought with much anticipation!  coffee and bourbon aromas pour out even before ive tilted the bottle - additional aromas associated with bourbon show up: vanilla, woody oak, and alcohol as well, but to a slightly lesser extent.  some sweet malt, although those aromas are more of an afterthought.  very little carbonation, oily like i like my stouts.  flavor is sweet and alcoholic, giving way to some coffee and roasty astringency.  hot finish, i suppose because of the alcohol lent to the beer from the barrel, but aside from the apparent alcohol finish, this is a well-done barrel-aged stout - not over-the-top.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
3448,"2006-03-16",4.0,"The aroma is a mixture of oak, vanilla, roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate.  The color is a deep rich black with a nice tan head.  The flavor is of chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and coffee.  The finish is smooth and coats the mouth.","USA","ehhdayton"
3448,"2006-03-11",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2007 Bottle. A hard pour gives the balck, opaque liquid a nice half inch tan head. The aroma is certainly full of coffee, chocolate and I suppose a hint of bourbon...much more subtle than some of the other bourbon aged beers. The flavor is where its not so subtle, its like an attack of coffee, bourbon, and dark chocolate and some dark fruits in there somewhere...very rich and bittersweet all around. Velvety over the tounge, juicy at parts, with a semi-sweet finish. A great dessert beer and/or night cap...certainly nothing one would want to start the evening with. Im really going to have to factor in price on the overall score...while this is an excellant beer...its no more excellant than its non-bourbon aged brother which is almost half the price.

update: 05/06/07. After having not only a slew of this years batch as well as a side by side of 06 and 07...I gotta give this one some higher marks. Both this year and last year seem to bring out the bourbon elements that should be there while leaving behind things like hot booze and an overbearing amount of coconut. These elements are in fact here, but they give way to a nice rounded oak flavor...both chocolate and vanilla coming out in layers over tones of coffee and light smokey malts. ANother thing worthy of mentioning is the absolute velvet pour, its almost like silk pouring out of that bottle which gives pretty thoughts to what the mouthfeel is like...smooth as silk...thats what it is. A few bottles Ive even encountered what could only be described as ""sludge"", while surprising it is certainly not unwelcome. Also, while I find the price a bit steep, it seems worth it when compared to others in its categorey.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
3448,"2006-03-11",4.5,"12oz bottle It is a little late for breakfast so this is more like lunch stout, but I did just wake up a couple of hours ago.  Pours black with a nice dark tan head that settles quickly back to 1/8 of an inch and laces in thick layers.  Aroma is full rich coffee, milk chocolate, and just a hint of bourbon.  Quite pleasant and one of those brews that you just want to sniff for a while before you sip it.  Flavor is just as divine as the aroma.  Nice full coffee flavor, some rich milk chocolate up front as well but the back of each sip is where you find the nice sweet bourbon flavor and just a touch of oak and vanilla..  Nothing too extreme or overdone just full flavored and blended oh so well. Nice smooth palate without much carbonation.  Feels almost slick and oily in the mouth.  Nice smooth finish and the alcohol is nowhere to be found except in the warmth that this brings after a few sips.  This is some really really good brew!!","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"

3448,"2006-02-27",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2009 This is a nicely done imperial in the bourbon style. Dark black body is sitting under a very thin, almost non existent mocha head. Boozey-er than its breakfast counterpart, with the coffee still there, along with the roasty malts, though the bourbon takes away some of that. You can taste the booze, along with some of the earthy bean that was also present in its younger brother. This is a good example of what the style should be. Not offensive, and fairly easy to drink given the bourbon base and the ABV. Thanks to my girlfriend for sharing her sample. MI brewers guild fest- 06","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

3448,"2006-02-26",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2006 On tap at the MI Brewers Guild Winter Festival. Thanks to Founders for bringing this rarity. Poured with a large head, whose carbonation got in the way of an otherwise great beer. Same notes of oatmeal as from the regular Breakfast, although the coffee has faded a bit to a older coffee note. Not as bad as an aged breakfast stout, but still the coffee tasted a little less than fresh. Chewy and viscous, an otherwise pleasurable experience. Bourbon is done well, not excessive. RERATE on 4/16 from the bottle: Going up two points for appearance. The carbonation was just right from the bottle. Going down one for aroma.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
3448,"2006-02-26",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 29, 2008 Bottle:  Excellent coffee aroma with lots of chocolate, vanilla, and light bourbon.   Flavors are very similar to the original version (although Ive come to learn that this is not the regular Breakfast Stout aged in bourbon barrels).  Quick initial chocolate presence up front that finishes with huge roasted coffee flavors, light vanilla, and light bourbon.   Founders does a nice job of not overdoing the bourbon.  Its subtle at first, and increases as it warms, but never dominates like some bourbon aged beers.  One of the best bourbon barrel aged beers Ive had. 10-4-9-4-18
2008 bottles have more vanilla, stronger coffee, less bourbon, and a much stronger oak presence in the finish.  Strong oak presence in the finish is the most obvious difference.

3448,"2005-04-04",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2006 Re-rate based on 2005-2006 version, sampled at the Michigan Winter Beer Fest in Lansing.An incredibly rich, balanced Imperial Stout with strong roasted coffee dominating the aroma and flavor.  The year-long bourbon aging left a soft, round vanilla and oak character that beautifully complements the rich coffee and understated chocolates.  This was an excellent step off the heavy, sweet RIS path paved by most of the other brewers at the fest, despite the impressive nature of many of those brews.  Absolutely no acidity.  Smooth, balanced, beautiful.  Much improved over the already good 2003 version.Bottled version, sampled 27 March 2006.  Served at room temperature.  Deep opaque brown body, thin-medium ochre head.  Rich aroma of roasted coffee and vanilla beans, with added emphasis of tannins from the oak barrels.  A deep sniff yields some alcohol burn.  Swirls of oak and vanilla infiltrate the roasted coffee and dark chocolate body, with a slight bourbony alcohol burn on the finish.  Rich body, but not syrupy or heavy.  I believe Ive said all I need to say about this beer.  Rating stands.  Go buy some.2003 version.  On tap at Founders.  Dark brown/black body, thin tan/ochre head, leaving nice lacing.  Prune, plum, chocolate, and bourbon aroma, definitely aged and nicely complex.  Compared to the Bourbon Stout, the bourbon in this beer was much stronger in the flavor, with the strong vanilla and oak still allowing plum and chocolate to peek through.  A very good beer, but not all that similar to the Breakfast Stout; the bourbon tends to dominate the flavor and gives this beer a unique character.  Rich and very tasty.8-4-8-4-16 (4.0)","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

3448,"2005-02-06",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2008 2007 bottle sampled on 3/21/08: Similar to previous vintages with a rich silky smooth and dark caramel and chocolate sweetness.  Good oatmeal bourbon flavor with some mild coffee notes.  Always complex and enjoyable.

First bottled release sampled on 5/4/06: Pours a viscous opaque with a brownish, thin-lacing head.  Aroma boasts lots of fresh, dry roasty coffee and a good light oaky bourbon balance with some dark fruits and brown sugar.  Body starts with a light caramel malty sweetness revealing some earthy bourbon and coffee complexity before a warming, lightly roasted mocha finish.  It seems a little hot right now, but should improve with some age.

Sampled at the 2005 EBF: Rich oily black opaque body with a beautiful thick dark brown head.  Aroma is a nice balance of sweet caramel and coffee with good oaky bourbon complexity.  Body starts full and sweet with dry oaky flavor and a roasty mocha coffee finish with very little detectable alcohol.  A great beer to start with and well balanced with the bourbon flavor.  Founders is going to be giving Bells and Three Floyds a run for their money in the midwest.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3448,"2005-02-01",4.2,"Bourbon barrel offers obvious aromas of oak and vanilla which add nicely to the roasted malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate from the base beer.

3448,"2005-02-01",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2007 2005 draught XBF05.Dark black, mostly likely opaque body with a surprisingly decent-sized head for a barrel-aged beer.  Sharp notes of brandy soaked prunes, Spanish coffee, Irish coffee, vanilla blossoms.  Pretty interesting aroma, all told.  Flavor has some sharp alcohol notes, syrupy bourbon, light bakers chocolate and plenty of harsh dryness on the finish.  Medium-full flavor, but a bit loose in texture.  I keep finding some out-of place syrupiness.  And what I loved about the Breakfast stout (lack of astringency and acid/alcohol) really seems to be a problem here.  Sharp, bitter and too alcoholic.  7/4/6/3/12Draught at Redbones, 8/6/06Stuff only lasted 2 days and I can see why.  First sip cold actually produces a perfect breakfast stout flavor up front, with chocolate and lightly dry roastiness following.  The bourbon comes on the end, and is at first, quite sharp and apparent, with harsh tannins and vinousness.  However, that was only the first sip or two.  As it warmed, it actually got to the point where it was only minimally noticeable.  Just adding some dryness and another layer of complexity.  In short, another one of the few times Ive had a barrel aged stout done correctly and not dominated by it.  Very slick, lightly chewy body on draught with near-perfect carbonation levels.  Some vanilla and coffee, with some warm bourbon notes trail off very pleasantly.  7/3/8/5/16.Draught at Redbones on 5/4/07Hmm, not that this was overly bourbony this time, nor was it too hoppy or messy.  But this time, it actually seemed a little bit muted/dull what have you.  Somewhat chalky and very roasty, but the brilliant sweetness matched with juicy, fresh hops seems to be gone this year.  Im still impressed that its not overdone, but it didnt seem to have much character this batch.  Lots of dry chocolate, heavy, dullish roast and probably a lot of neutral barrel tannin accounting for the more lackluster feel/flavor/aroma this time around.  Bound to happen as the barrels get used.  Score is a rough average of my 3 experiences with it thus far.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3448,"2005-01-31",3.6,"Draft, EBF: Ebony black, nice tan head. Complex coffee emanations melted in whisky and a truck of oatmeal. Creamy chocolate component makes it appear very full. This smells as good as the original. Unfortunately, here ceases the comparison to me, the barrel-aging gave it a tartness Im not a fan of. Whisky, dark fruits and oatmeal all work well enough, but roasted acidity and vinous cereals are not a perfect match. I just dont dig the balance. Mouthfeel has also lost some compared to the original whereas it feels much thinner and has a close to metallic barrel tinge.  A beer that starts well.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The Lure:Decadent coffee and vanilla cream, dry roastiness and bathing oatmeal cookies are sensually laced together. 

The Festivities:Ferocious oaky vinosity somewhat mars the rich vanilla and coffee beans, but the roasted malt bitterness sure gives it a run for its money. Thinner-bodied than its coffee imperial stout counterparts (Speedway and Péché Mortel) and not as satisfying as their regular Breakfast Stout, for me. Still, one of the highlights of the festival, an inspiring creation I wish to have again in full-bottle format.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
