3335,"2016-04-14",4.2,"Poured up on tap at RBWG16 where it exhibits a hop hazed deep gold body that supports a nice looking white head of foam. The aroma offers up spicy onion and smooth cantaloupe flowing into a soft pineapple sort of citrus grapefruit note toward the end of the draw. The taste delivers nice bitter sort of mango and pineapple with a little smooth juicy cantaloupe. It also has some bitter floral and earthy and grassy hops going on too. This goes together really well. Solid.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
