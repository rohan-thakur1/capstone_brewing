2463,"2016-08-03",3.7,"Bottle. I was excited to finally try this one! It pours a dark reddish brown color with a small, fizzy light brown head. The aroma has hints of cherry cola, rich toasted melanoidens, light caramel and hints of spicy/herbal hops. The flavor is the same. Pretty rich with well developed carmelized malt, toasted melanoidens and some low earthy/spicy bitterness. Medium bodied. Pretty traditional in character. I liked it.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
2463,"2016-04-24",4.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Originally reviewed 6/2/2011.

Deep brown body that looks red when held up to the light. Off-white frothy head that leaves some lacing.

Dark fruit aroma followed by caramel and some chocolate. Nice.

Taste is not quite as impressive as the smell, but very nice nonetheless. Dark fruits and caramel malts. Some burnt toast in the back end, but its not unappealing. Hardly sweet, despite the maltiness.

Good body. Not quite heavy, but certainly not light. Doesnt feel like a wimpy beer, despite that you cant taste the ABV. Medium-low carbonation makes it feel smooth and creamy.

2463,"2013-12-13",3.8,"Huge thanks to Homer321 for sending this along way back in his pre LOL days!
Pours a very dark brown with some reddish hues when held up to light. Its got a big head and a lot of lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is very rich with caramel, coffee drinks, and especially a fair dose of tootsie rolls. Very pungent & nice smelling I mean the tootsie roll thing is mildly off putting, but everything else is really extraordinarily inviting, rich, and aromatic that its pretty forgivable. 

Flavor has a lot going on, the sweetness level is right where I like it for Dopplebock, which is to say that it tastes less sweet than it smells, but has a nice caramelly bit that works wonders with everything else. There is a nice cheap coffe flavor that sucks when its with coffe but is aight in beer sometimes, aside from that its got some light bitterness, some chocolate, its mildly boozy and even has a real chitl port wine flavor. geeze I dont mind this here brew.

Its got like a medium mouthfeel with low carbonation that carries a beer of this size well.

Aroma: The nose has chocolate malts, sweet caramel, dark fruit, and a touch of smoke

Flavor: Tastes rather sweet, it has chocolate and caramel malts, with a touch of dark fruit

Overall Impression: 
This is a pretty solid Doppelbock.  I found the smoke to be a little more present in the nose, but I didnt really seem to taste it.  Meanwhile, the reverse is true for the fruit presence, which was quite subtle in the nose, but more present in the taste.  Regardless though, I enjoyed both the aroma and the flavor.

Pours a solid almost black with the faintest of garnet highlights when held to light. Bubbly off white head rises to the occasion before slowly receding to a ring on top. Smells of malt in spades. Smokey, dark sugar, fig, raisin, caramel, chocolates, soy, they are all there. Taste is a malt bomb as well. Rich dark malts fill my palette with tastes of caramel, fig, date, and hints of alcohol and a slightly earthy hop bite that keeps everything in check. Medium carbonation, thick body, syrupy mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this one. Sweet malty goodness with a burnt edge that keeps it from being cloying.

A- Poured into a New Glarus pilsner glass, this beer sports a a really active, cascading head that is a rich khaki or wet sand color. It has excellent retention and lacing. Looking like a chunk of coffee cake, the head floats on top of a deep chestnut colored beer. 

S- A clean noble hoppiness is first noted. Its got lots of grassiness. Beneath that is a rich maltiness with notions of soy sauce, chocolate chip cookie dough, oak and light coffee. 

T- The taste is very in line with the aroma. A grassy hoppiness is in the foreground with an awesome cookie dough flavor comprising the bulk of the underlying flavors. Really nice fresh coffee is all over the finish.

The flavor is dominated by dark flavors such as cola, molasses, chocolate bar, prunes, decayed wood and deep-woods dirt, with a slightly tart fruitiness in the finish.  Dead trees, dry leaves, earth, cola, and molasses in the nose.  Full bodied and somewhat dry on the palate.  The beer has only a trace of carbonation, so its pretty close to flat, but there is enough roasty dryness and modest acidity to keep the palate stimulated.

Appearance: Pours a dark brown-hued body with a frothy, off-white head.

Smell: Roasty, toasty nose with notes of coffee, chocolate, powdered toast, burnt nuts, dried, bitterish herbs, dark fruits, and a few stray drops of dark rum.

Taste: Toasted bread crusts sweetened with crushed toffee bits and yielding a roasted grain quality hinting at freshly-roasted coffee beans sprinkled with chocolate powder. Some cracked nuts. Subtle date-like dark fruitiness. Spicy, herbaceous Continental hops with a little bit of imparted bitterness. Light smokiness from a puff of cherry-flavored aromatic tobacco. Small hint of licorice. Lightly lingering roast on the bittersweet finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Amply smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: In the past, I have had issues with the Thomas Hooker flip-top bottles.

2463,"2010-12-20",4.2,"Appearance: clear, deep, and rich in burnt ambers, garnets, mahogany glints and an almost port glitter when held up to the light. Tan head which fades into a thin blanket. Swirls with a slightly thick head, little to no lace.

Nose: musty quality which lingers underneath and in the back; earth and leather. Dark fruit pits, nutty and bitter, hold the sweet fleshy meats please. Burnt molasses and burnt sugars; sugar-cane. Dark fruit flavors are concentrated, intense, and a smidge tart. Port ages in the back.

Palate: beautiful, classic, and inspired. Clean and sticky from first quaff to last; medium-light weight. Prunes, plums, and raisins are the dominant dark pitted fruits with a def nip of tartness in the back of each swallow; quick then quickly gone. Sweetness in the middle along with black cherries, chocolate cake, and dark breads. Raisins and rum meet in a rum cake and bready tryst. Brown sugar and cinnamon provide a smooth mix of sweet and spice. Candied sugars are a faint memory. Complex and drinkable at the same time. Earthen must whispers but never overpowers or detracts.

Final Thoughts: seeing as the imperial porter and this brew from Thomas Hooker have some very prominent common traits, it makes me wonder what yeast strain/family they use. I am also impressed and pleased with the overall cleanliness of their beers and the almost traditional quality they possess. I look forward to trying more.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Deciding to open something new I found this in the cellar.  Popping it open I was greeted with an interesting take on a doppelbock.  This was a great beer to try though I don’t think I’ll be picking up another one unless I run across it on clearance somewhere on a road trip.

Aroma / Appearance - A half finger dirty white head swirled fluidly around the tulip glass.  The smell of musty books, cherry pits, wet earth and black coffee were the whole of the experience.  A little weaker than expected I thought it would have just a bit more richness.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy with a dry bitterness the coffee start yields to light smoke and hazel.  Afterwards come a malty finish.  Light on the tongue for the style I feel that could have been just a bit thicker.  Nonetheless it was a nice drink for a cool fall evening.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2463,"2008-07-18",3.9,"Beer # 7500, that’s 3/4 of the way to Eternal Ticking Glory, ladies and gentlemen.  I decided to toast this momentous occasion with one of the most well-respected lagers in America today, the Liberator Doppelbock from Thomas Hooker.  This was a 2006 bottle and the result was, well, interesting.  Thankfully I can say that I’ve had few, if any, beers quite like this particular bottle, which makes it a fitting beer to have on the occasion. Dark brown colour.  Chewy, smokey, plummy aroma shows some oxidation.  Deep plums on the palate, again the product of oxidation, but I don’t mind it at all.  There’s a light smokiness, some pear, and some burnt sugars.  To me, this has developed well, although I’m sure this much oxidation and fruitiness in a doppelbock would turn just as many people off as on.  Sweet and tart finish, an eclectic product of age, rendered upon a beer that may not handle such things as well as it should.

Flavor is much more roasty and dry than the aroma led on, but its not necessarily a bad thing.  If it had been, it possibly wouldve been a little cloying for 500mL.  Its kind of hard to pick up on the caramel and toffee since the roast overpowers a lot of whats in here.  Only hints of raisins and vanilla in the flavor.  I do have to admit it sweetens a little upon warming, though the beer was probably in the lower 50s when I started drinking it.  Roasty semi-dry finish with bitterness peaking around a 2.  Alcohol is masked well.  Silky full body with little pin pricks of carbonation.  As this warms up, some lightly smoky notes show up in the aroma and the flavor.  I ended up liking this more as I got through the bottle.  I maybe could have gone for a bit more sweetness in the flavor, but not much.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Taste is very smooth and almost refreshing which is strange for a doppelbock.  Sweet yet not too sweet with a big flavor of chocolate and roasted malts.  Drinks almost like a stout.

2463,"2008-02-24",3.7,"Vintage 2006.  Pour of a deep chestnut and burgundy hue, topped with an abundant, thinly textured foam of light tan.  Aroma traverses a diverse and complicated terrain; the first is full of minerals and crisp bitterness, showing juniper berries, basil, spruce, and aluminum.  Misplaced and clumsy.  Second, a warm wave of apricot jam on cinnamon French toast, green apples, pear, raisins, and banana, maple syrup and vanilla dipped.  Vinegar and garlic clove sweetness precede a final and lasting swell of pineapple rind that brushes aside the hosewater bitterness of the initial impression.  Flavor is much simpler, very doughy and dense, with lots of caramel, bakers chocolate, and dark fruit; lightly acidic with hints of red grape, tart baked apple and lingonberry.  The residual impact of that mineral and cleaning product character of the initial aroma is resigned but still present, giving a muted, grating metallic bitterness.  Candy sugar and fig.  Palate is very creamy and soft; medium to full in body and very sweet.  Finishes with raw walnuts and hazelnuts, drying out completely and showing some licorice.  Rich and complex, this one is packed with nuances, most of which are interesting and satiating for cold weather purposes, although those greenish moments of synthetic bitterness are too nagging throughout for this to be a top-tier example.

Minimal traces of thin line lacing are scattered about the glass.  The aroma shows dark and light chocolate varieties, as well as vanilla, cola, and some dry, woodsy notes.  The flavor shows cocoa powder, dark chocolate, oak, and some dark fruits.  Molasses and root beer come on pretty strong just prior to and during the finish.  Medium bodied and well carbonated, despite its age.  Pretty nice Doppelbock.  I think my bottle might have been a little past its prime.

Mild malty aroma, nothing much to get excited about though.  There just wasnt much going on in the nose.  Flavor was bland and oxidized.  Some hints of caramel and dark fruit, but the good flavors seemed very subdued and a metallic astringency was very prevalent.

A: The beer has a dark body that has a ruby color when held to the light. There was almost no head.

S: It has an interesting aroma. There is a roasted note mixed with dark fruits, but there is another smell that is either alcoholic or phenolic.

T: The first thing I notice is the dark fruits, but there is a pronounced bitterness or astringency that is buried with the roasted malt in the background. The bitterness stays around as an aftertaste for a while as well.

Deep dark ruby pour with a dense, tiny-bubbled tanned head nudging toward light brown, increasingly rocky.

Touch of pine in the hops, pairs nicely with earthy roast.  Bitterness more pronounced here than most other examples of the style.  Molasses and salt.  Touch of burn-ash above the masterfully employed Munich.  Full body, feel a bit slick.  Warm, dry aftertaste brings out wonderful spicy notes and a touch of coffee and a touch of syrupy chocolate.

Overall: This is a very good Doppelbock.  It is quite complex, full flavored, and definitely deserves its spot in the list of top Doppelbocks.  It could also quite possibly be mistaken for a Porter in a blind tasting.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

Has a fairly strong chocolate/cocoa aroma along with a touch of caramel and dark fruit. The body is quite dark, brown but approaching black and the tan head diminishes rapidly from its initial thumb thick size. Very smooth and round on the first sip. Quite malty with lots of cramel fruit and some very faint X-mas-beer like spice. Finish is roasted/toasted grains and caramel sweetness. Very nice brew.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"
2463,"2007-03-31",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2007 2006 bottle.  Pours a dark dark brown with a nice light tan head.  Big sweet malt, though not cloying.  Toast and a slight amount of caramel, alcohol, and fruity to peppery hops.  A nice balance.  Slight hints of honey and cinnamon.  Thick and creamy in the mouth, with perhaps a bit of grit, but not offensive, only giving this some more weight, very nice.  About perfect.  Tastes great too.  Sweet, round malt.  Toast and caramel round out this treat.  Alcohol and roast are present at a greater level than I expect in the style, but Im certainly not complaining.  this is a nice beer indeed.  A slight hint of chocolate in the finish, over the alcohol and spicy hops.  the finish is very dry and dark though.  I  may just buy another bottle when I head back to Connecticut again.

Creamier and tastier as compared to the Imperial Porter, but I am giving it the same score because each of these beers have their own pros and cons. The only reason I am giving this a better grade is because the coffee flavor is a little more subtle in this drink which allows more flavours to be present while drinking. Smooth start and finish as I drink. I can see how this can be a bit carbonated. It takes this beer back a few percentage points. I like this beer a lot and hope to enjoy the rest of it.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

The flavor is very nice: lots of sweet malts, some spicey hops, and some other flavors - caramel, maple, coffee. The alcohol is detectable in the flavor, too - though it is minimal. The balance of the beer is very nice - and very appropriate for the style (i.e. good bit maltier than it is hoppy). The mouthfeel is a little thick.

Smells of brown, woody chocolate with a slight lime rind hiding behind it with a pinch of brown sugar.

Tastes of a great combination of woody chocolate and barley that winds its way around a welcome alcohol that effervesces up into my nose with a sweet milk chocolate and a light, fantastically paired woody hops that is left in my mouth in the finish. 

The mouth feel is medium to heavy bodied with a great swarm of micro-bubbles that give this beer a pudding-like feel.

2463,"2005-08-18",3.9,"Sampled last night at a meeting of the Champaign-Urbana Beer Club. I thought at first bacteria had gotten into the bottle because the beer gave off this sweet-sour funkiness almost in the Belgian style. Scrolling down through the ratings, I believe this was intended. The flavor wasnt bad in any sense, merely highly peculiar. But Doppelbocks can be funky as several others noted, so I think this one is alright. Ill rerate later if necessary. Concerning the beer, an impressive mix of flavors ranging from sweet cherry and apricot to fudge and dark bread. Finishes with a decidedly yeasty wheatness. Tasty, not my first choice of flavors, but complex indeed.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Poured black with a creamy light tan head.  Beautiful aroma of dark fruits, molasses, and cinnamon.  Taste is surprisingly dry, with emphasis on dark fruits, cinnamon, grapes... a touch of syrupyness.  The hops have a much more dominant presence here than I would expect from a doppelbock.  They bite the tongue and add to the dryness to create a long bitter finish.  This actually seems to work for the drinkablitly of the beer, since some doppelbocks Ive had have been too cloying.  Despite the dryness, theres not much alcohol character to this.  Nicely crafted... could go well with food or on its own.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Strong roasted aroma bursts through immediately, with a touch of malt underneath. Rich body and more bitter and roasty than expected. However it smooths out pretty quickly. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee and a touch of spice and hops. The finish is tasty with an array of hops, spice and nuts. Really this Doppelbock is on the other end of the spectrum from the smoother and creamier types, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2463,"2005-07-17",4.5,"Thin to medium blackness with crimson brown lit edges. Stocky, firm, billowing, dark sandy brown cap grows at a wonderfully slow pace to a thick despenseful foam of chocolate milk bubbly froth. Dense thickness proceeds to keep its position whilst engaging the liquid. The lacing is placed in creamy patches.

Aroma is delicate and lofty with a robust tangy malt base heeding to molasses and dark cherry/plum. Sensitive dark chocolate cookies and toasted spiced breads linger over the top with some nuts, cinnamon, seasame, and fresh clove. Turns a bit woodsy and oily after its been sitting along with a note of farmhouse yeasty must. The delicacies this has on the nose are outstanding. Its no beast mind you. Its soft and frail to the point of memory. Lovely!

Taste has a big malty start with a large portion of molasses and dark cherry bringing a sweet intial shock to the palate. Loaded and full of high and sweet tang. Levels off after some time in the glass and after the first few minutes of sipping. Middle reveals a slight chocolate underlay with a cookie dough sweetness keeping it a tad buttery and vanillafied. Turns darker with roasty malts and slight smokey earth as the chocolate helps lead away from the intial tang of sweetness. Finish smooths out with more delicate mannerisms then the front and middle. Nicely melded spices of nuts, cinnamon, ginger, herbal hops, and fig cross and mend the rest of it together as it floats off with a ghostly dignified dryness. It grows in complexity, which is by far the most intriguing thing about this beer. Sip to sip it keeps bringing more fragile layers within.

Body of this beer is huge. Continuingly full. Big on malts with tang at first, then toast and roast, then spices and smoothness. Has a unique Belgian-like crispness in with the tangy front that twists and drops into smoothened silky rich wonderment of malt complexities and airy spice. Wow, what a ride! This doesnt seem like 8% at all, it has a much bigger presense, without any alcoholic hints what so ever. The drinkabilty is a bit more slowed down and appreciable.

2463,"2005-05-05",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2006 1 L bottle, snifter.  A deep chestnut hue and a firm, frothy khaki head signal the rich malts waiting in this sturdy brew.  The aroma is grand, yet humbleintense, but never out of control.  Dark bread and caramel melodies underpin the experience, allowing ample space for airs of chocolate and roasted coffee.  A mercurial walnut element shifts in and out of focus.  Allowing a moment for contemplation, and this elixir to warm, reveals the rugged herbal, woodsy tones yielded by the grace of noble hops.  Every sip swiftly brings warm, controlled malts to the palate, mimicking the aroma deftly.  Chocolate, caramel and brown sugar find their place up front, stabilized by a wispy roasted bitterness.  At the back of the mouth, roasted and nutty flavors become more pronounced and mingle with supple herbal hop notes.  As it warms further, the distinct but intoxicating semi-sourness of the Munich base malt is unmasked.  The swallow unveils date, almost plum like essences, resting upon an oaky dryness.  A full and creamy texture is robust enough to blend all the flavors together, but never appears clumsy.  Carbonation is right on for the style; present, but never distractingflowing but well paced.  A brilliant example of the style.  A little darker, and a little richer, but damn this reminds me of Andechser.  A doppelbock like this one, but with less roast, chocolate, (no) caramel, and more pure malt goodness could easily gain access to the upper fours for me.Brown hue with a tan, frothy, tall head.  Huge pecan aroma.  Roast, coffee...somewhat sulphorous, in a good sort of way.  Heavily sweet, lightly acidic (sour) flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter finish.

Almost zero oxidation, still a huge head and great retention.  Wonderful beer, with a thick, rich, chocolatey aroma, light toffee and some nuttiness.I can see why some people were criticizing this beer, when it first came out, for being too chocolatey for the style.  Its very similar to a chocolate bock and has a thick, fudge-like mouthfeel and plenty of that flavor.  Still, its flawlessly brewed, manages some moderate roast on the end and just has a perfect texture.  Only a light breadiness, relative to style.  Regardless of any criticism on this batch, Paul (the brewer) adapted his recipe to be much less chocolatey and show more vinous bock character in subsequent batches.  I give him all the credit in the world for this wonderful beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2463,"2004-12-10",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2007 2004 Bottle Date, Sampled December 2004.
Well Santa delivered this 1 liter bottle of liquid bread, that I have been wanting to try for quite some time.  This beer pours an opaque dark amber-brown color.  The head is thick and creamy, whipped to an almost mousse like consistency.  As I pour the  richest, most enticing, malty aromas emanate from my glass.  It smells malty sweet, with notes of fresh honey baked biscuits, a hint of molasses, almost a subtle spicy quality reminiscent of a dark cake flavored with molasses, concentrated caramel, and hardly a hint of alcohol is found in the nose.

My first sip, notes a satisfying rich, but not too thick body, that is richly sweet, and has notes of chocolate, and a hint of espresso-like roastiness in the finish.  It is well carbonated, and the chocolate & subtle roast notes really combine quite well, dont get me wrong though this is not roasty like a stout or porter, but it has a nice level of bonus roastiness that is not usually found in a Doppelbock.  It really adds another dimension on top of the full malty flavors that this beer, and all good Doppelbocks, are redolent of.

I must admit that upon first sip of this beer that I was expecting it to have a fuller, more dense body to it, I have now come to the conclusion that this beer is perfectly situated with the proper heft.  The palate is full and creamy, and not so heavy that I will not be able to slowly consume this bottle over the course of my evening.  This beer certainly lives up to the monks, oft cited, yet increasingly ignored plan, to create a beer, nah, I mean a liquid bread that will fortify a fasting brother through lent.  Yet I cant help but wonder that if I were a monk if I would not feel like this was too easy, it is almost too easy, and satiating, to have a beer such as this to sup on during a period of supposed fasting.

This beer is really smooth and flavorful, it packs a immense amount of malt complexity in each sip, I get notes of caramel, just browned whole wheat toast, a hint of molasses, and sorghum.  As it warms up a bit a subtle fruitiness starts to manifest itself, it is funny to me that rich lagers show hints of fruit, which is supposed to be the dominion of the top-dwelling ales, but the concentrated malts in this beer lend it to subtle, yet concentrated fruity notes reminiscent of cherries, figs, quince paste, perhaps a hint of apple butter, and perhaps a bit of dried date as well.  I would have to say that, while subtle, the cherry notes are the most dominant fruity notes.  And, as the aroma suggested, there are rich notes of dark spice cake here as well.

Even the aroma starts to pick up fruity notes over time, though in this case the dominant notes are a mix of dried fig and dates.  What a kick ass beer, I have only finished one glass of the three that I am going to get out of this beer and it has inspired me to pontificate profusely, and certainly quite a bit more than my standard brew review.  That in itself should let the reader know that this is a beer worth contemplating, especially on this unusually cold (for a Tucson) night.  I am definitely exited and perhaps even giddy (or is that the fact that I have not slept in 36 hours) that I am about to continue my contemplative journey with the middle glass of the three that I am going to enjoy this evening.

My one meager complaint in this absolutely wonderfully malty, malt-lovers cradled chalice of honeydew is that the far finish has a subtle hint astringent graininess, this really is quite subtle though and only recognizable because I enjoy chewing on malted barley of all shades & flavors.  This is one outstanding beer, which certainly has not disappointed me, in typical American fashion, a bit of brash arrogance and rebellion has been added to the traditional Doppelbock malt-bill, but luckily the brewer had the sensibility to not over-hop a beer of this style.  Let the malt shine on its on complexities and merit, maltophiles rejoice, and make sure you get a bottle of this as soon as possible.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2463,"2004-11-20",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2006 A light off-white head stands on a dark nut brown body.

Its highly malty, almost caramelic with a shadow roastiness, chocolate hints and a luscious earthy profile. Palate is also deeply earthy, like concentrated malt, but still very soft and smooth. Welcomed green hops joins in the finish, rather grassy. It finishes on mild chracoal and potent tobacco notes all around an oily presence, making me think of roasty mazola. Like the other troutbrooks Ive had, this has this honest medium body which seems a bit dead, mostly from low carbonation and seems to take off from the flavor development and this is really too bad.

2463,"2004-09-09",4.2,"9/8/04.  Poured out of hand-bottled 12 oz. bottle, obtained in trade with TAR on RateBeer 9/7/04.  Pours with an insanely huge, dark tan-brown, beady, fluffy, and sudsy head.  Fizzles and fades rather quickly because of the large size of the bubbles, but its incredibly active nonetheless.  I cant believe how carbonated this bottle is.  A bit too much, if you ask me.  Its kind of annoying, however impressive.  Dark, inky jet black with a thin dark brown outline.  This is a doppelbock??  Wow.  Very good head retention after it gets down a bit, like a rootbeer float.  Lacing is blotchy and lumpy and hardly there at all because of the suds.  Nose is incredibly malty and vicious.  Just about had me convinced that this was actually an imperial stout and Jeff had mislabelled the damn bottle.  Huge dark malts, very roasty, acidic, and rich.  Subtly sweet and woody, with traces of nutmeg.  Initial taste is big wood and huge alcohol burn, almost like a wood-aged stout.  What the hell is this stuff?!?  I approve.  Theres a familiar tingly sensation and brightness like other doppelbocks, but this gives off such sick, almost sour wood and mulchy flavors its just crazy.  Chocolate and almost stinging peaty acidity.  I almost have to choke it down, but then I cant stay away from the next taste.  Its like a glass full of that burned skin hanging from the top of your mouth when you eat a piece of scalding hot pizza, in liquid form.  Finish is very long and tries mightily to battle a bold dead-and-wet-leaves acidity on the roof of the mouth.  Other flavors poke through-- unsweetened chocolate and some hoppy old coffee.  Like burnt acidity without any of the charcoal taste.  And yeah, there's a hint of sweetness there too, but it's like some asshole was going to give you a spoonfull of sugar to help the medicine go down and decided to torch the sugar and turn it into a black, tarry liquid first.  Overall dry and numbing sensation, but incredibly mouth-watering still.  This will sit you up straight in your chair and bitchslap you with its malt backhand.  Mouthfeel is all over the place-- starts with big and bright carbonation, letting you barely even feel the liquid at all; finishes with sticky dry residue; somewhere in the middle the beer uncovers itself to medium-thin and slightly oily, but by the time you can get through that far your mouth is almost numbed from the fizziness and the acid burn.  I may have had this beer too warm.  All of the other comments about its ""smoothness"" and ""drinkability"" simply do not apply.  I mean, Im a sucker for huge and flavorful beers, so I can definitely dig it, but to call this stuff a doppelbock is pretty ridiculous.  Its not in the same class of beer (for better AND for worse) as Celebrator and Andechser Dunkel.  Makes me want to cry.  But Ill still love her in the morning. . .  Many thanks, Jeff.  You've ruined my palate forever.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
2463,"2004-09-07",4.3,"The head is a marvel, full at first and slowly lasting as a thin ring. Move the glass and the head sticks in the tiniest bubbles to the sides of the glass lazily. Smell is incredible burnt wood - woodier in the aroma than any dopple Ive had. A strong smoky, meaty aroma with an undercurrent of raisin is so strong yet subtle. I love the mouthfeel here; a bit thin and very tingly - probably a bit out of style range. Hoppy, with a plasticine, bandagey, piney presence - some nutmeg and a lot of pepper. Very noble hops underlying the whole thing. None of the back of the throat cloying so typical of dopples. When warmer, this sweetens to plum, walnut, and becomes slightly oily, with still tons of roastiness. A bigger, more American dopple - bolder in many ways than Celebrator.

The flavor is rich and full and a spicy smoky note makes this Doppelbock different from others Ive had. 
I suppose I have been spoiled by drinking some outstanding homebrewed Doppelbocks which have all been superior to any commercial Doppelbock Ive tried, but this is the best commercial brew of the style that Ive had to date.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
2463,"2004-09-05",4.5,"Appearance is terminaly opaque, fully black, much more impressive than your everyday doppelbock, with a large, lush head, with resilient, creamy froth, very appealing, setting standards high from this auspicious image.
Aroma is fresh, full of yeast, malt, doughy, even, cookie-dough, can we say? Bread, ginger, and other spices, but still light, airy, creamy, very eggnoggy, and very, very nice.
Taste is complex and delicious, a wonderful blend, with an excellent presence in the mouth, a masterful marriage of beery parts, perfectly blended, nothing lacks or wants, nothing weighs heavy, either. 
Chocolate and dark fruit dominate the palate, with palpable malt on the mouthfeel, a sturdy, even tenacious presence occurs on the tongue and parts of the senses. Starts to feel a touch like brandy, even port wine, with nutty, cocoa flavors never far behind, getting even a bit candyish, with a hint of licorice.
Ive had several dopelbocks in my day,each a bit of its own, some good, some great, and I even had the Andescher before this sample, and you know what? I have to say, TH knocks the socks off the competition, anyway, anywhere, anyhow! Its just got so much more, and then some! Best doppelbock Ive ever had, when all is told, just a great sum of its parts!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
2463,"2004-09-04",4.6,"Big 1 liter bottle with a ceramic swing top was an imposing sight.  The top came out with a nice popping sound effect, and the beer was poured into the goblet.  The color was dark reddish black with an inner glow that exuded charm.  The head was small and fleeting, and the lace was minimal.  The aroma was sweet and roasty malt that gave off delicate fig, and chocolate notes.  The hops had that distinctly Germanic grassy tone to them.  The taste was sweet and malty, like a dopplebock should be.  There were raisin, fig, apple, and toffee flavors to be enjoyed here.  There was also an earthy herbal spiciness to the hops.  Creamy and dry at the same time, the mouthfeel was enticing and the drinkability was enormous.  This was a very beautiful part of a package that came to me from mikeys01 of beeradvocate.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
2463,"2004-08-28",4.5,"Poured dark brown with hints of some reddish brown with a medium sized tan head and nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of plums, nuts, roasty and toasty malt, and that standard lagerish finish.  Dry, roasted malt, chocolate, mocha and sweet chocolate.  Very nice, creamy, full, mouthfeel.  A real winner.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"

2463,"2004-08-06",4.1,"Bottle from a Growler.  Big beer here, thanks TAR. Very dark color almost stout like, very dark brown colored,oso slight brown head rims the glass.  Aroma is malty, carmel,sweet, maple, and slightly burnt.  Sweet flavor.  Mix of sweetness and noble hops bitterness on the finish.  Excellent beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
2463,"2004-08-04",4.4,"Dark blackberry cobbler, covered with a rich crumb topping aroma. Toasty, dark caramel tones. Maple syrup and cocoa in bitter, understated finish.  Not a lot of evident hops, just enough for balance,  ""Malt bomb"" sums up but does not do the beer justice.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2463,"2004-07-24",4.0,"Poured from bottle at VT Brewers Fest -  Poured a dark red color with a light tan head.  Aroma was of malt dark fruit.  Flavor was complex mix of heavy malt, fruit, vanilla and some smokiness.  Finish was slightly sweet with some hop bitterness.  Very nice!","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"
2463,"2004-07-18",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2005 From the bottle at Vermont Brewers Fest.  3 oz sample.  Raisin, toffee, licorice hints in the nose.  A touch of smoke in there too.  Grogeous moderatly hazy mahogany color with an off-white head.  Very smooth taste.  Slightly sweet malty start turning to a little ethanol bitter sensation then finishing with some sweet smokiness.  Very very smooth and drinkable.  The gem of the brewfest!------ now that Im in CT...Had this stuff in the bottle and this is easily one of the top 3 or 4 enjoyable beers I have had to date.  This has lots of sweetness to it--almost like a sweet stout, but not cloying.  This stuff is just amazing.----2005 Version-----The new version is much maltier and not as sweet.  New recipe is poor compared to the old one.  The 3rd bottle Ive had was infected of the 2005.  Quality has gone down dramatically.  Find yourself an 04 if at all possible.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
2463,"2004-07-17",4.0,"Sampled at the VT brewers fest out of a corked bomber that the brewer cracked for us.  Reddish pour with a little off white head.  Grassy aroma, some raisin, some alcohol.  Grassy to start, kinda plain.  Some alcohol noted in the middle, sweet raisin, plum alcohol to finish.  A very nice offering.","Chazy, New York, USA","ChazyRPh"
2463,"2004-07-04",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2004 Dark red color with a smallish head. Aroma mostly malt with some dried fruits. Taste is big. First theres molasses and chocolate. Also notes of vanilla, oak and alcohol. A lot going on here. Not as sweet as the description but full bodied.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2463,"2004-07-02",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2005 After the nj fest. Really nice beer. Big malt character. Big malt aroma.Very roasty.  Flavor is malty with lots of chocolate undertones. Caramel notes. Clean tasting. Enjoyable.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
2463,"2004-06-29",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2005 Latest 03/05 Batch. Very dark and roasty. A bit like a porter or brown ale, and yes, slightly ale-like. Maybe a bit rushed. Still very tasty, but not to syle. Nice malt character and mouth feel.
After NJ fest 04. Bottle courtessy of a BA. I need to get a bunch of this next time it comes out. Nice big malt aroma. Flavor is big and malty as will with chocolate undertones. Clean and well made. Needs ratings, for I am certain it will do well.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
2463,"2004-06-24",4.4,"Dark chestnut brown with a monstrous lasting tan head. Hearty malt aroma. Lots of malt depth to this one. Peat, light licorice, malt, caramel, pale malt, mocha, light roasted malt, hints of vine ripened fruit, and did I mention malt. LIght malt sweetness in the start which gains momentum and with toasted malts, light tar, touch of black malt and earth. Some woodiness as it warms. Seems to get thicker and richer as it warms. Very smooth and deceptive brew. Coffee linger. If anything a touch too much in the dark malts, but I like the mix.  Thanks Slikwily!","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2463,"2004-05-12",4.3,"Unfiltered chestnut. Thick, puttied, light mocha head. Alluring nose of roasted wood, meaty malts, plum pudding, and crystallized sugar. Quite firm with whispers of nougat, smoke, licorice, and port wine. Dense, creamy carbonation. Soft, spongelike body. Frontal assault of medium-roasted malts coupled with more fat and fluffy, toffeed malt notes. Toasted malt hulls gather steam to enrich the sweetness amid rich smoked malt trailing. Mineral notes and vague plum acidity combine for a leathery effect at the back of the throat while roasted wood flavors continue to poke through. Mild mineral, roasted barley twang, spicy anise, and woodsy notes diffuse the sweetness at the finish while the understatedly juicy hops remain in the background. Lingers with mineral, toasted marshmallow, and unsweetened chocolate tones. Delectable flavors, overall. How about less acidity and a better-defined noble hop finish to accompany the deliciously assertive roast/smoke medley? If so, this would be flawless","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2463,"2004-05-10",4.3,"This is one hell of a large bottle.Nice dark brown color,small tan head that faded slowly and left behind a good lace.Nice aroma of malt and fruit with mild hint of hops along with maybe a faint smoky hint as well.Very nice flavor of malt with a hint of coffee maybe some chocolate light hint of caramel and mild smoke that is there but is fleeting.The hops come through very well with the alcohol being kept in check nicely,in fact very nearly unnoticeable.The after taste is malty and coffeeish with a slight hop bitterness.This is a very smooth easy drinking brew that was a total surprise.Not nearly as tough as some brews in the style can be but very balanced and well done.Thanks to Boto for sending this fine brew my way.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
2463,"2004-04-13",4.8,"This was an outstanding doppelbock.  The beer poured a dark brown from the one liter swing-top bottle and had a thin cream colored head.  The taste was very smooth, malty, and superbly balanced.  Highly recommended.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
2463,"2004-04-04",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2008 Pours dark brown and the aroma is spicy, with a bit of roasted malt. The taste is initially sweet, but it turns a bit bitter. Not as heavy as I expected, but very rich  and complex.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
2463,"2004-03-20",4.5,"1 Liter Swing-top Bomber:  First off, the bottle is superb.  When you pour this one it is an opaque brown color.  There is a bit of a tan head.  Decent lacing.  The first thing that hits the nose is some roastiness:  I didn't expect this much in a doppelbock. There is sweetness in the nose also.  Caramel, fruits, and maybe a hint of smokiness?  The flavor is rich and full.  The roastiness is there, but there is a ton of other flavors in here.  Complex and extremely tasty.  Their beers just keep on getting better with each release.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
