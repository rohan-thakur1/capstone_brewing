4165,"2017-04-08",3.7,"(750 ml bottle) Black stout-like beer, with a deep ruby hue. Rocky tan-coloured head, containing bubbles of all different sizes. It leaves a good lacing up the side of the glass. 

First and foremost, an aroma of roasted malt: chocolate, coffee, and some dark wild fruit, like raspberry and blackberry. This is followed by a hint of banana, and some warm spices - cinnamon and clove. The taste is quite sweet, but also a little acidic. The finish is slightly bitter, with some underlying earthiness, minerals and oak.

This is a pleasant, roasty bock, but a little too acidic. The fact that Maisel & Friends have developed such a rich, chocolatey bock despite the restrictions of the Reinheitsgebot is simply amazing.","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","victorsampson96"

ersma: die heimseite müsste mal überarbeitet werden, da sind die texte nicht scrollbar. das ganze ist jedenfalls eine aktion, die auf jeff maisel zurückgeht, der sich befreudete brauer ins boot holt, um besondere biere zu kreieren. das ist auf jeden fall vernünftig.
dunkelbraun mit rotstich, mittelviel beige-farbiger schaum, dessen haltbarkeit besser sein könnte.
der geruch ist röstmalzig mit süßlichen noten.
der antrunk ist süßlich, hefig mit etwas röstmalz. hätte gewettet, da ist weizen drin, ist aber lt. etikett nicht. dezente schoko-aromen und etwas karamellige süße. die mitte bringt hopfen mit, es bleibt aber auf der süßlichen seite. der abgang ist süßlich-herb ausgewogen, melasse und karamell.
die flasche kann man nur als gelungen bezeichnen. 
fazit: ordentlich, bleibt aber etwas hinter den erwartungen zurück. wenn sich ein bier schoko-bock nennt, kann man von klaren schoko-noten ausgehen. die könnte man natürlich deutlich ausgeprägter erreichen, wenn man das rhg außen vor lässt und schoko mit in den sud kippt.  probierenswert.
