2607,"2007-12-07",2.9,"Im not a huge fan of this overly carbonated weizen...especially the german hefeweizen.  It doesnt quite mix as well with the fuller body, thick, viscous, and full of banana and clove flavors that are enjoyable.  It overpowers those aspects, and brings it to an abrupt finish on the palate.  I do like the balance however, as it is well done.  Drinkable, but not my speed.","Crestwood, Illinois, USA","JLAudio"

2607,"2003-04-03",3.4,"(500 ml. bottle). Filtered wheat beer, like the name says crystal clear, very light golden, enormous head. Strong aroma of ripe bananas (or rather: the artificial ""banana"" filling you get in some chocolates + bubble gum), cloves too.  Banana, cloves and hops in the flavour - but there's just too little of everything. Why filter away the goodies? Very short aftertaste.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
