Thick mouthfeel with some lingering smoky peppery spice and heat. Sweet, but the smoke and spice takes the edge off nicely. The high ABV is impressively completely hidden here.

4158,"2014-08-26",4.0,"Quite good. The mead is burgundy and still. Appears somewhat viscous. The aroma is chile, cherries and honey. ItÂ’s sweet with a mild zing. The cherries really come out as it warms. Both in taste and aroma, the chile is spicier when cold, too much on the , but the cherry blooms and overpowers the spice as it warms. The mead is quite sweet. It might be a bit much, but spice reigns it in. At room temperature, the heat is warming and prickly. The burn builds in the finish. Moderately tart cherry flavor. The honey flavor gets a bit overshadowed but it seems quite pleasant. Perhaps, with more experience with meads, I could pick out flavors better.

Appearance: I absolutely love the color of this, itÂ’s incredibly dark garnet with a velvety haze. This looks nice!
Aroma: The aroma is strong and leans sweet, it reminds me a bit of a Pinot Noir from far away. Sweet cherries are apparent with a slight pepper heat, thereÂ’s a touch of alcohol and honey with a light floral presence. This is complex, but not very inviting to me.
Taste: The intro is very sweet cherry with a honey backing that progresses to an unassuming peppery finish that gets to a mild heat, maybe a tad too hot. The finish lingers, prickling my tongue for a bit, and leaves a warming finish down my throat.
Palate: Velvety and nearing thick, no carbonation.

Body is average with just a slow building heat after the initial sweetness. Flavor is what this brew is all about. An interesting initial burnt cherry sweetness slowly changes to a chipotle bbq sauce that has an interesting mild sweetness from dark fruit that builds with the addition of molasses and burnt brown sugar but then has a distinct burn from the addition of chipotle peppers that adds a unique twist to really make this mead stand out.

Pours a moderately deep ruby color with a thin ring of white bubbles encircling the glass. Sweet aroma is dominated by honey and cherries, with some faint pepper on the tail end; I doubt IÂ’d pick the pepper out if I were sampling this blind. Sweetness hits the palate first, cherry moreso than honey. The flavor of the pepper gradually takes over, with cherry cutting the heat. Really interesting how this develops on the palate.

The aroma offers up sweet cherry juice followed by chili chipotle meat and then moving into some booziness. The taste creates a pleasing rich cherry juice flowing into firm levels of chili meat, a bit of smokiness and then capsicum heat. The heat really begins to hit midway and it lingers for minutes into the after taste.
