3204,"2017-06-21",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2017 can. Poured clear gold with a thinning but creamy white head. Aroma of light barley malts, crisp and clean. Light Bodied, average carbonation, buttery mouthfeel. Lightly toasted malt base with sweet notes of melon and grapefruit, paired with just enough dry herbal hops.","Chatham, Ontario, CANADA","Strangebrewer"
3204,"2017-06-18",3.3,"330 ml bottle bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen Long.
Looks: Clear golden Half finger head with soapy white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing with active slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and slightly pungent full Lager malt, with floral, spice, wood, earth, strong dough, lemon and strong grass.

Taste: Close to light sweet Lager malt, with light citrus, floral, light molasses, spices, wood, thick bread, lemon, mid to light bitter hops and grass.

Body: Mid to light body. Dry and fairly slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Very good Lager maltyness in slightly thinned but smooth background. Not much citrus / grapefruit to speak of. Good floral with light sweetness. Woody spicy, very dry bready with lemon to round. Good!

Hoppiness: Floral, spice, wood, earth, lemon and strong grass in nose. Light citrus, floral, spices, wood, lemon, and grass in taste; Bitterness is moderate for an abrupt, mid to low astringent malty finish.

After taste: Dry. Bready woody and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one taste more like a competent Premium Lager. For all the hops it boasted, only Target and Styrian Golding are most notable for the bitterness and woody spicy characters. Good for a Lager, but not much as craft beer to brag about. Drinkable.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
3204,"2017-06-13",2.9,"Yellow body, white head, some lacing. Faint aroma of hops, breadiness. Taste is more or less like a typical pale lager with the faintest element of hops. Not bitter. Kind of just a slightly dry rhubarb element to it. This only has slightly more character than a pale lager and not as good as nice Helles.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"

3204,"2017-06-06",3.7,"11.2floz can, 17/05/17 that Im guessing is a BBD of 05.17.2017, so not to beyond it. Poured into a nonic glass, and the carbonation can be seen rushing up to the top of the golden body. Basic grain aroma are given off the soft white head. The palate is refreshing light with well composed flavors of light toast and earthy hops. This is in line with some of the better American takes on pilsners and golden lagers. There is just a little more hoppiness than typical for the style, yet not overwhelming. An enjoyable session beer, worth picking up as single in a $9 mix-six.","","balloonbuffoon"

3204,"2017-05-27",3.9,"330 ml can into lager glass, best before 7/14/2017. Pours fairly crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the whole glass. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, melon, pear, grapefruit, orange zest, cracker, white bread, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of fruity/citrusy/earthy hops and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, melon, pear, grapefruit, orange zest, cracker, white bread, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, melon, pear, grapefruit, orange zest, cracker, white bread, herbal, pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of fruity/citrusy/earthy hops and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a delicious dry hopped pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of fruity/citrusy/earthy hops and pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful for the low ABV, with a really nice hop profile. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

I love how theyve not buried the PL under a mound of hops - its still distinctly a Lager, with quite low bitterness. Carbonation prickly yet fine, body lightist medium, nearing watery.

The first surprise was the overflowing foam when I opened the can - youdve thought I had put it in a paint shaker, when in fact it was never mishandled at all. The second surprise was that it was actually fairly palatable - but that being said, even though its well before the BB date, I think its on the elderly side for the style. (The obscure date code reads L6109A 20:15, which might be the 109th day of 2016 - and since thats April 19, that would seem to correlate well with the human-readable BB date.) The dry-hopping with Galaxy and Ella hops really doesnt come to the forefront, and its dominated by bready/biscuity malt and noble hops.

3204,"2016-07-15",2.6,"dry-hopped lager? seems a bit like and oxymoron. pours a golden yellow (very similar to most premium lagers) with thick head. light body, but prominent bitterness similar to a mild pale ale. very hard to say anything bad about this, but not something that can be rated highly either. beats your typical American/Canadian macros anyway.","Fredericton, New Brunswick, CANADA","swiseman"
3204,"2016-07-15",3.3,"Keg at Guildford arms. Clear golden. Nose is grass, pale malts. Tastes grass, light dry hops, pale malts. Not loads of flavour but overall a decent lager. Especially after not-so-good ale.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","nihtila"
3204,"2016-07-10",3.2,"Blonde dorée comme il faut, mousse décente, amertume typique dune lager, mais avec un côté herbacé agréable apporté par le houblon. Pas mal dans le genre, en tout cas un minimum intéressant.","Strasbourg, FRANCE","AssKicker"
3204,"2016-03-12",3.4,"Fresh, tasty and pleasant hopped lager.Hazed yellow golden color with a fine white head. Ok lacing. Fine hop intensity in the aroma. Medium body and a fine carbonation. Good balance between sweetness and bitterness. Pleasant citric hoppy, mild fruity and a fine malty back.[On tap at Bedford Arms in Bedford, England]","Halden, NORWAY","Cunningham"

3204,"2016-02-14",3.8,"Bevuta alla spina a ""La piccola Abbazia"", Roma. Limpida, colore biondo intenso con qualche riflesso ambrato. Schiuma bianca, compatta ed abbondante, di eccezionale persistenza. Naso leggero e non troppo persistente, sentori di erba fresca, fiori di campo, qualche nota agrumata. In bocca il malto fa da padrone, sebbene bilanciato da un discreto amaro; lievi note erbacee e speziate sono donate dallo styrian golding. Nel complesso lho trovata una birra estremamente piacevole ed equilibrata. Consigliata.","Roma, ITALY","HopHeadSamurai"

Ottimo prodotto senza dubbio.","ITALY","P76"
3204,"2015-04-16",3.2,"Charlie Wells, not Charles. I suppose hes hip and down with the kidz. Dont shoot the messenger, and heres the proper rate: lager yellow, low to medium carbonation. Grass and tropical fruit aroma. Sweet hoppy taste with acrid flashback. An odd savoury note in the odd finish. A decent enough lager, but Charlies going to have to up his game if he wants to mix it with the big craft beer boys.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"
