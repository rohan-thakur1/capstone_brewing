1354,"2009-05-29",3.8,"On tap at the Wisconsin Micro-Brewers Beer Fest.  Poured clear, deep brown with a short cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up toasty caramel, molasses, and treacle with accents of berries.. just a hint of coffee on the back.  The flavor had berry and fruity sweetness at the core with lesser caramel, molasses, and toffee joining.. mild earthy and fruity bitterness surrounded.. tasty, longer finish.  Creamy carbonation on the palate and dry overall (just enough sweets for balance).. light-medium bodied.. enjoyed the residual dark sugars at the finish.

1354,"2008-05-26",3.1,"In short: A very roasted Dunkel-ish beer
How: Growler at Flossmoor on Pre-Dark-Lord-Day party 2008.  Big sample thanks to bwkreiger (or so I see from ratings below, thanks a lot dude whoever you are)
The look: Brown-ish body with a short-lived beige head
In long: Roasted grains on the nose bordering smoke (or maybe its the Calumet name playing tricks on me).  A round body and smooth taste.  Toffee, dark fruits and even some distant nutty notes.  Like with the nose there was a strong highly roasted grains/wheat presence.  I got an almost-smoke sensation on the nose and an almost-ashes sensation in the taste.  Overall and ok beer that probably suffered from being drank at a party where there was just too many great beers.

1354,"2007-04-17",4.3,"Fourth stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 and one of 11 brews offered at this small town brewpub at any time. I remember trying Calumet Dark for the first time in 1990 at the Midwest Beerfest in Oconomowoc, WI. Bob Rowlands entertaining charisma and Calumet Dark were a perfect match. No wonder his brews on this site usually scores high. Just like the Calumet Dark I remember over 15 years ago, it pours a deep mohagany with some amber highlights. A thick creamy off-white head slowly retracts giving a good lacing. Aroma picked up caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla and roasted barley malt. Taste is smooth and creamy with wonderful aftertaste of caramel and chocolate malt. This one has to be their flagship beer and happy to learn that Bobs son is continuing his recipies and brewing skills. I can see more road trips to Chilton in the near future.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

1354,"2005-06-26",4.1,"Deep, semi-translucent amber brown in color thats now dispersed its initially creamy white head.  Nice malty aroma, some semi-sweet chocolate chunks, hazelnuts, cake batter and pure cocoa powder.  Flavor onsets with a chocolate malt ball taste, joined by Rolos and hazelnuts.  One of the sweeter dunkels of my day with a borderline doppel sweetness.  As a dunkel, definitely one of - if not the - best of the genre.  Malt slick hits as creamy and then sweetens it presence and pulls at the corners of the tongue equivocally.  Easily Calumets best beer.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Most of the recent posters are spending more time talking about Bob and Bonita than the beer; perhaps thats appropriate.  Anyway, it was a good experience, its certainly a unique brewpub, but I do think this beer needs some moderation in the ratings.  Its a very good, chocolaty, relatively complex dark lager; but I dont find the finish all that exceptional, it is a bit on the thinnish side, and it is rather lacking in hops.  Bobs much more interested in the malt than the hop, and it shows in all of his beers.  A good, solid dunkel, Im very glad I made it to the brewery, but for me it is not world-class.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1354,"2002-12-28",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2003 My story of this brewpub seems to run congruently with every one elses.  I told Bob that I was from ratrebeer.com and here to rate as many of his brews as possible.  Bob did remember some of us ratebeerians, especially the guy from new york who paid more ofr the shipping than the beer.  It was a real pleasure spending 3 or 4 hours in the pub listening to Bob""s eclectic joke reperetoir.  At any time Bob is willing to share any information about his brewing techniques, ingredients and or experiences, opinions on the topic of his beer and others.  This guy has got something going on that is truly unique.  All of these beers have a wonderful creamy smooth mouthful and a caramely sweet taste to them, due to his direct flame under the wort, and a palate that cleans up very well, giving all of his beers some unexplainable power to make you take another drink. He calls his style something of a cross between English and Irish brewing techniques.  Oh yeah, about the beer.  Deep mohagany body with hints of amber.  Very dense, creamy off white head.  Nose was filled with caramel, chocolate (both milk and dark), notes of well roasted malts followed by hints of bitter hops.  Tastes of chocolate with an unparalelled malty carmel sweetness.  Great body, tons of depth, hints of smoke in there somewhere too.  An almost floral finish, very drawn out with barley, and a hint of spice.  Mildly effervecsent and very pleasant.  Everything I look for in a lager.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
1354,"2002-12-26",4.4,"I have to say this is a very good beer. Last year while visiting some friends in eastern Wisconsin we stopped by the Tavern to pick up a few gallons for the evening. Well Bob had not yet opened when we got there and the door was locked. On the way back to the car he heard someone yelling. It was Bob telling us to come on in and hed get our beer for us. Well this being our first trip to Rowlands I was very impressed with the service. Needless to say we spent the next few our exchanging jokes(if youve ever met Bob youll know what Im talking about)and enjoying a few of his other fine beers.","Long Prairie, Minnesota, USA","AndyOtremba99"
1354,"2002-10-30",4.5,"I had the pleasure of sharing a growler of this esoteric Wisconsin beer, courtesy of my beer companion Tom.  Very dark brown/mahogany...well you see it in the picture.  Big, bittersweet malty aroma, with notes of cocoa, brandy, and cinnamon.  Medium body, and light carbonation.  Superbly malty, of course, with many layers of complexity.  In fact, probably one of the most complex lagers Ive ever experienced.  Im reminded of Fullers 1845, due to the sweet, spicy gingerbread type flavors.  Theres a delicate, lingering, sour finish which Ive never encountered in a dunkel, although it served well to cut the sweetness of the malt.  This beer is no joke, and in my opinion worthy of its hype.  If youre ever in Wisconsin, seek out Calumet.  Thanks, CaptainCougar.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
1354,"2002-10-21",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2004 I made a special point of traveling to this brewery.  Before this website, I had never even heard of the Calumet Brewery and its only 80 miles away.  Now I know why.  The place is one of the best kept secrets in Wisconsin.  It's hardly even a brewery in the conventional sense.  It's a beer-bar with one wall of brewing equipment and the whole place only has seats for about twenty people.   There is a pool table, a dart board, and a bowling game.  They also have a jukebox and one TV and the only beer they serve is what they've made themselves.  It's tucked away in the small town of Chilton on main street and the brewers have never entered any of their beers into any competitions, nor do they care to.  Bob and Bonita Rowland seem quite happy with their establishment.  They have a 3 barrel brewing system at the bar and another 7 barrel system in a building down the street.  A sign above the bar marks the total number of barrels brewed by the Rowlands.  It read 3378 when I was there and  they've been in business since 1990.  You do the math, there's no wonder the only place to get this beer is in Calumet County.  If you get a chance to go there, take it.  The best way to try this beer is out of the tap, plus Bonita said they're not too fond of going through the hassles of shipping growlers.  In a way it's almost unfair to compare this microbrewed beer to its larger companions, since its obvious the smaller the brewery, the better. (At least for the most part.)  Anyways, back to the rating...The dark was exactly that in color, with a smooth frothy tan head with a sweet malty aroma.  The first sip was initially sweet and then grew sour before finishing up on a hoppy note.  The body was very complex and full of malty character.  This is definitely some of the best and most drinkable beer I have had, and I will be making the trip back to this brewery many times.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1354,"2002-10-13",4.9,"This is just about the best thing since sliced bread!  A true dunkel-lovers heaven, with a hearty body and taste thats sweet, yet not cloying.  The malt comes through in buckets, but is just the right mix of chocolate and whatever else is in this to make it all work.  So glad me and some friends made the short trip out to the brewery as this beer is only on tap!","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Velveeta99"
1354,"2002-09-25",4.9,"On a trip to Lake Geneva, WI, I tried this quixotic brew.  Its fairly sweet and drinkable, and what it lacks in complexity, it makes up for in pure drinking pleasure.  A true beergasm!  I didnt have enough of Calumets other beers to rate them, but they seemed good as well.","Wheaton, Illinois, USA","AleHole99"

1354,"2002-07-25",5.0,"Well, the folks at Rowlands Calumet Brewery were kind enough to FedEx four growlers to NYC and so I gladly partook in their fine wares.  The Dark is a cross between an American Dark and a Munich Dunkel.  It is cloudy, unpasteurized and looks exactly like a Sam Smiths Nut Brown Ale.  It is a dark LAGER, not a stout, and tastes of chocolate malt, with a touch of hops.  It is really easy drinking and Ive polished off the entire growler already!  Bob Rowland has scored a <font color=#FF3300> direct bullseye </font> with this magnificent dunkel!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1354,"2002-05-21",1.4,"Had a growler at my friends house!

Awful! Didnt like it. Sweet, bitter and not very hoppy.
Sorry had better ones

Re-rate: After getting harrassed because of my harsh critisizm I re-rate. Maybe I got a really awful growler. BUT believe me I know how a dark munich has to taste as of being German. Anyway I will give it another try and try it again. I thought this is an opinion forum but I guess some know better. Ive seen a lot of bad ratings of excellent beers here. Just to make people here aware that it is not only me who can be hard in his rating!","California, USA","666seth"
1354,"2002-05-03",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2003 At first it seemed a bit sour then after the initial carbonation left the full mall flavors kicked in.  My kind of dunkel.  A dark brown color with a fairly light head.  Hopped only to distract from the malt sweetness. An excellent domestic.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

1354,"2001-04-18",4.9,"Its damn good.  The chocolate malt is the most prominent flavor and then there are the caramel undertones.  When combined I would almost think that some celestial being came to earth to brew it.  And it comes in a sweet 1/2 gallon jug.  Finally, something good comes from Chilton.  Its perfect for a night on the town.","Wisconsin, USA","The Friar99"
