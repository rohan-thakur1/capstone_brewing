582,"2013-08-13",4.0,"Bottle, 330 ml, into a tulip glass at home. ABV 6.5%
Light brown coloured beer with a two fingers tall off-white head sitting on top. Good retention, light lacing left behind. Some bits and pieces floating in the body.
Aroma is a bit sour, with red grapes, light caramel.
Very nice taste, wood, caramel, malts, some metallic notes, herbs and spices that you find in a winter warmer such as cinammon and clove. Aftertaste is a combination of sweet and bitter.
Medium thick body, good carbonation, nice dryness on the palate.
Overall this was a huge surprise as I was expecting just another dubbel but it turned out to be so much more complex. A top deal if I take availability and the low price I paid for this one. Highly recommended.
Earlier Rating: 5/3/2013 Total Score: 3.8750 ml bottle corked and caged bottle, at home. Poured into a tulip glass. ABV 6.5%
Opens with a loud pop. Beer has a beutiful deep ruby red colour, with continuous activity in the body. Really impessive colout. Big head, three fingers tall, light beige in colour and soapy. Low retention,collapses fast, but after that, half a finger of foam stays on the surface for quite long. Traces of lacing can be seen around the glass.
Aroma of caramel, grapes, a little bit of sugar. Smells similar to a good wine.
Taste is mildly sweet, at least at first. It follows very close the aroma, lots of grapes, some light dark fruits flavours, sugars,caramel malts. Frutiy aftertaste.
Medium to thick body, soft carbonation.

Its above average on the carbonation carbonation level and it has a light oily - almost a bit thin mouthfeel. Not as sweet as the aroma suggested. Almost what is called dry actually and the taste itself is kinda dusty and dark nutty. Old plums and unsweetened figs. A little bit of dry chocolate paper with traces of both yeast and alcohol.

582,"2012-06-22",3.6,"I found very hard to review this bier. Probably it was the high temperature of the beer when it was poured in goblet glass (perhaps it would be better a trappist glass, my bad).

So, making these remarks I saw a dark brown beer with brown 2-finger foam. When it went down it remained few lacings on the glass.

It didnt  smell a remarkable aroma for me (I blame the temperature, but Im not sure). Some spicy and yeast. And there was something that I just couldnt identify.

It tastes cherry syrup, no doubt. It starts sweet and goes towards dry bitterness. It is a very strange direction, full of curves. The high carbonation is so present that makes up the whole with some spicy flavor, yeast and apples.

Good dark belgian ale, but is seems to play around with us. Ill try it again to define better my opinion about it.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","lelisboa"

Aroma is dark fruit (cherries, figs), caramel, green apples, and peppery spice.  The brew tastes like dark fruit (raisins, cherries), peppery spice, candi sugar, grain, and a little bit of tart green apple.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit slick and has good carbonation.

582,"2010-10-22",3.9,"The front of his bottle poured clear brown, though the nearer we got to his bottom, the bottle-conditioned sediment turned clear dark browns into a soft, slightly milky dark brown. He tasted darn good both ways though. Let me explain. Atop his browns was a whitish head which lingered as a thin film sans lace. As much as I enjoy gazing upon a luxurious head marked by decorative lace, so too do I enjoy reveling in a bouquet of aromas rich with the spice of life. Brown sugar, cinnamon, toffee, caramel, candied apples, red licorice, raisin bread stuffed with plump dark raisins and sprinkled with allspice and everything nice. His nose plays with red and black plums soaked in old tawny port. Nice doesnt even come close to describing his nose, and without further ado, I dive into his awaiting depths. Being bottle-conditioned, his body and mouthfeel is frothy with bubbly effervescence which carries his rich palate across my tastebuds in ethereal fashion. Whereas the black and red plums steeped in port came last in his nose, they come first in his palate which is chewy with a healthy chunk of raisin bread fresh from the oven. I do love me some raisin bread, and Grotten Brown has plenty. Grapes flitter in and out of the plums, while their skins make for a tart bitter bite in the back of each swallow. He lightly dries the top of my tongue which is quite happy at the moment while I admire a healthy dose of chunky delights hovering suspended in his brown depths. Chunks are good, whether mixed in the beer or as a healthy shot of concentrated vitamin B at the end. The second half of his bottle changes character in a fascinatingly tasty way. Sweet maple melts into an ocean of toffee as apples bob up and down, desperately fighting a losing battle for air. Every now and then, I manage to steal a bite which is ripe with fresh apple juices and succulent meats. Id kiss him, if I could. Instead, Ill settle for finishing off the remains of our shared bottle which finishes with less effervescence for a smooth and slightly heavier mouthfeel which revels in plums, grapes, apricots, and a dash of vanilla extract.

582,"2010-05-23",3.7,"750ml bottle purchased 1 year ago from Buyrite Liquors in South Plainfield NJ. Allowed to age in a temperature controlled environment until today.

Appearance: Pours a lovely chestnut brown into a Chimay goblet with a 1 finger cappuccino crown that shows some retention and lacing.

Smell: Toasted malt, a hint of brown sugar, a soap quality, a mild hop note, and a slightly root beer like quality.

Taste: If you drink this cold it comes off as a really watered down and boring brown. When cold it gave me the impression that this one doesnt age well and if you still have it, its probably past peak already. But as it warmed up I got more flavor out of it. Still not a fantastic brown by American standards, but a decent Belgian brown.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Slightly creamy due to the time allowed for the bottle conditioning to continue.

Drinkability: Simple flavors, not a heavy mouthfeel, and an abv below 7% so its pretty sessionable.

Serving type: bottle

582,"2009-12-30",4.2,"This is one of my favorite belgian beer. The beer is higlly carbonated but the white foam quickly goes down to a thinn lace. The color is dark orange and unfortunantly quite clovdy as there is live yeast in each bottle. The aroma is very belgian with spices and dried fruit and phenols. In the taste you find the fenols and fruits that gives quite a marvelous blend, smoth and full of taste. The body is medium to full, a real good sipping beer.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"

582,"2009-07-19",3.9,"Bottle, not sure how old, but doubtful that its fresh based on the fact that it was the last bottle of it on a shelf of beers that clearly sees little action. Aroma has lots of stuff going on, including mint, bubblegum watermelon, lemon, dark malt, spice, and earth, all with a sort of Jolly Rancher feel to things, though the feel was not associated with any particular fruit. Though for me it wasnt the highlight of the aroma, the spiciness really comes to the forefront in the mouth on a mellow malty background with candy sugar and sweetish fruit notes popping up more toward the finish, most notably cherry, along with more of the spiciness.

582,"2008-07-19",4.0,"This intriguing cave-aged brew pours a light chestnut brown with ruddy highlights and a large puffy beige head which laces beautifully in sheets and rings around the glass. Certainly complex, the nose is strikingly nutty, coincidentally suggesting candied chestnuts (marrons glacés), walnuts and plenty of hazelnuts. Genuine vanilla bean is in ample supply and very attractively highlighted by browned butter and salted-butter caramel. Perhaps I was synesthetically influenced by the description, but the nose had a damp, almost mossy spice component. Spice cake, prunes, raspberries and black pepper also lend to the complexity. The flavor continues to suggest hazelnuts, though rye bread and heavy yeast aspects are also dominant. The mouthfeel is exceptionally silky, reminiscent of a good cappuccino. Dried fruits become increasingly intense as the beer warms. Particularly apparent are dried pears, apricots and figs, each lending a vinous tone to this fascinating brew. A subtle but enjoyable earthy sourness lingers with the remaining malt bitterness. Well balanced, this an exciting, unique and eminently drinkable beer. A delicate and thoughtful effort that ages well and obviously garners my respect for Pierre Celis. (24/06/07, best by 21/11/08)","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

This sat around in the cellar for sometime but I neednt worry, best before is not until 2010. Pours a slighty fiery murky dark amber - this really looks like muddy homebrew, so top marks for not trying to be this years model.  Subtle but extraordinarily complex aroma features marmite at first, then an excellent mix of dark dried fruit (tending to prune) with a little baby sick and leather. Settles to a nice brett-like sourness with a light toast character and an excellent dry woody note. Caramel shows through as it warms.  In the mouth it is more of the same - all the complexities of the nose, which I would simplistically describe as woody, brett-infected, peppery cola (is it Coke or Pepsi?) with a dry leathery finish.  A little aniseed and earth enter the mix in the finish. Light mouthfeel, medium-full carbonation. Understated, sleek, simple, sublime, sexy. My style of beer, and one of the best. I want more.

The finish is dry and slightly earthy, bitterness minimal.  My glass is left with a sheet of contrasting thicknesses of unbroken lace.

App.:  Appealing deep copper, small yeast flecks and a tight tan head.

Palate:  Medium body, smooth, soft carbonation, a touch syrupy.

The head fades into an uneven layer that looks like islands and peninsulas in the glass, jutting from the glass. The aroma is very heavy with toffee-like malts. There is also a significant aroma of yeast, fruit (macerated pears, banana), and spice (allspice with hints of nutmeg). After smelling it several times, some tart fruit begins to show through, too (dark, sour cherries). The flavor begins very malty and full-bodied on the tip of the tongue with a hint of funk (dry, dusty taste - perhaps brettanomyces?). The front of the tongue also detects some bitter hops,  more malts, and some spices (cloves, peppercorn). The malt profile remains spicy throughout - which, along with the carbonation, tickles and slightly stings the entire length of the tongue. The middle of the tongue detects more dry dust, sweet malts and molasses, some spice, and hints of alcohol.

Flavors were similarly bright and crisp, though slightly sour, with apples and pears coming to the forefront.  Sweet malts, bready yeast, and a hint of hops complemented the overall sweetness of this brew.  The spiciness was present, but was of a mysterious and undefined nature.

Great yeast presence.  FIrst thing I notice is actually the wonderfully creamy body, and its not as high-carbonated as expected.  Great for me.  Tastes of sugar, pear, grapes, earthy dust, and a light sour taste.  Finishes dry and pretty full, with some roast and an almost salty/sour taste.  I couldnt help but notice the very light sour tones in this beer, mainly cause it was giving me flashbacks to my first gueuze and flemish sour beers.  But I like the sourness here, cause it was so much lighter and fit with the beer, rather than completely overtaking it.  This beer loses some points for not having quite enough flavor to justify the creamy and almost thick texture, and not tasting all that unique in the malts.  But the yeast flavors and body were wonderful.


This beer loses points for nothing other than not being perfect.  The flavor is all there, and it ages with grace.  My original rating was from tap, but Im revising my rating with a bottle nearby.

It get´s much more interesting and gains much higher balance with the bottom yeast in the glass. Taste is very yeasty, very murky, some spicy undertones, malt, tiny bit of smoke, coriander, lemon with a little grain. This is a very delicate and crafty brew.

582,"2006-06-09",3.8,"A very nice beer, but not overly impressive. Poured a nice brown to ruby color with a very generous head (but tame), that sat there for my long savoring of this one. The lacing was also nice. The aroma was spicey, yeasty, and somewhat sweet (candi sugarish). The flavor was an interesting and complex blend of yeast (somewhat bitter), flowers, musty and earthiness, spices (again, somewhat bitter), grapes, and caramel malts. The finish was a bit too bitter for my liking (and because the flavor base wasnt really rich or overly sweet) and the mouthfeel a bit thin (although smooth) and highly carbonated. However, the complexity is worth a long article of commentary for those that can do it.... and for me, a higher rating than it would have otherwise received. Nice job.","","User37895"

Aroma was fairly weak but what I could pick-up was corn syrup or a candy sugar. Appearance was a dark, murky brown. Mouthfeel was above average but nothing exciting. Flavors were just too average for my liking, balancing on the edge between boring and bland. I could get some yeast, some malt but it was all just too boring.

The aroma is earthy like a damp autumn forest, with spices like clove, dark dried fruit and discernable alcohol complements.

This ale is dry and effervescent through and through, but a sweet, dark malt backbone grows more apparent as the beer warms to room temperature.  Mid-palate flavors include the aforementioned clove, but also essences of raisin, prune and sour cherry.  The finish is sharp, dry, and long-lasting, perhaps owing to hop bittering but also a heightened alcohol content.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ivan9856"

The writer suggested leaving part of the bottle opened in the fridge overnight to notice some pretty interesting enhancements.

582,"2006-01-26",4.1,"Beer from the grotto,  this is Pierre Celis legendary cave-beer which is predominantly made from Vienna malts,  uses spices from distant tropical islands and is cellared for a few years before sale. Quite a unique beer and this is evident when it came to tasting. Poured into a stumpy chalice glass, cool and not cold. Dense, creamy tannish head formed off the pour to sit an inch thick atop a murky, tawny chestnut body with a lovely tinge of red coming through in the lights. Head lasted for the length to frost over the entire glass. Mmmm, malty and wine-like could best describe the rather dry, spicy and almost savoury nose. Hints of ginger root, plum-wine and well-made chocolate pudding emanated from the glass with something else in there I couldnt quite pin-point (almost like cardamom pods?). Quite vinous in the mouth, even more so than the aroma, and predominantly woody like it was aged in oak. Medium bodied and softly, prickly in carbonation upfront before smoothing out towards the tonsils. Underneath the woody, wine-like malts lie flavours of bitter/sweet chocolate, roasted cashews, nutmeg and ginger root, and a hint of sherry that all melds together beautifully and keeps the palate reasonably dry right through to the malty and earthy, slightly nutty swallow. For 6.5% it makes for an unusually long sipper suited more to an Abt/Quadrupel than a beer of this strength. I liked it,  Ill definitely have to track a few more bottles down. Lovely!!!

Ahh Bier des Grottes. Its like an old friend. This was one of the beers that really got me started. A regular back up if there is nothing else I want. Spice and fruitcake aroma with a touch of the caramel creeping in. Muddy brown almost opaque looks with a good light tan head that lasts reasonably well. Lovely flavour that zips around the mouth as soon as you sip. Again it is spice and fruitcake that comes through with some plum, toffee/caramel too. Maybe just a little too much carb if I am going to pick holes. Nice and smooth with a slightly tart bitter finish. Almost always served too cold when I have it. Dont be too hasty, it gets much better as it warms. Ahh my old faithful.Edit Oct 2008... what the hell have they done to this beer? Not even a shadow of its former self. Thin mid brown, aroma is just about what it was, flavour has gone to pot. Weak and watery. Like a cheap imitation of what it used to be. Pathetic.Down to a 2.7 from a previously well loved 3.7.

I can smell lemon, plums, spices, apple, cheese, leather, yeast, caramel malt, and very slight hints of alcohol.  Theres tons of carbonation in the taste, but it has a surprisingly thin body for a bruin as well as being very dry.  Tastes spicy, malty, with licorice, vanilla, plums, raisins, minerals, honey, mulled spices and has some sourness to it that is very nice (some citrus, some similar to a sour hefe).

Poured slowly into my B'De Kluis Hoegaarden Abbey glass, and instantly a tannish head emerged staying consistent in girth the whole way up to the rim which sat about a finger high, its foamy and creamy with some divets but it eventually just became like melted butter sitting on top and never fading. Amazingly whipped and sits like fresh snow on the needles of a spruce. Lace sticks like glue in shelving globs and sheets of finely stitched lace. Beautiful! 
Aroma is mostly yeasty covering realms of clove, pepper, and cinnamon, musty bread, touch of citrus and banana, underlaying tones of malty sweetness. Taste is more of the same with a nice strength of one dimensional flavor with yeast that has some light notions of clove, pepper, musty bread and a backing of sweet semi-sugary malts. Not all that complex or layered, but a favorable sweetness and yeastyness holds for a good time with a medium body and a somewhat weak finish that has a very light nutty dryness.

Masterfully understated plummy esters, perfume, grape, lemon, dry chocolate, and musty books.  Fully expansive carbonation as it hits the tongue, quickly turning creamy. Soft tartness to lead things off, met by hints of oxidation and distracting glassy flavors. Passion fruit notes with a delicate hint of melon refresh the palate. Lightly sweet, bready malts make a brief appearance and lend the much-needed sweetness, but are quickly overrun by the esters. Then come the beautifully lemony and flowery notes, countered by a plummy, herbal backdrop with just a touch of herbal hop bitterness and sparks of musty yeast. Finishes with a mild tingle, soft spiciness and very plummy with the musty yeast and gunpowder notes hanging on. If only the flavor could match the aroma, this would be perfect. It also needs more malt sweetness to match the herbal, phenolic elements. But this is undeniably complex for the style.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

582,"2003-07-16",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2003 Re-sampled November 25, 2003 [a bottle expired May 2000 - in a vertical tasting to one expirering July 2005]:  What a great difference cellaring can do. When the bottle was opened it rose out of the bottle - even after so many years - there was no lack of carbonation. The color dark brown so you almost couldn't see thru it (a lot darker than the fresh one) and with a small brown disappearing head. The aroma a lot more powerful than in the fresh version and fantastic of cloves and spices. The flavor is great and it explodes in the mouth with spices, cloves, and wood. All in all a heavenly beer experience. A good advice - keep this in Your cellar.
Sampled July 16, 2003: [7/2/8/4/16] The aroma is powerful, sweet, and fruity with notes of plums. The color is an unclear dark brown, it has an OK but disappearing head. The texture is very soft, and the flavor is rich on fruit, it prickles the tongue and contains hints of alcohol, plums, caramel, coriander, and a little earth. A very nice beer.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Very recognisable change since the brewing was transfered from Desmedt brewery to St Bernardus. To my opinion an improvement. The taste is a nice balance of fruitiness and maltiness although I discover that slight bitterness towards the end.
