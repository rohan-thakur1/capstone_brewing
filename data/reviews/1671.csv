1671,"2016-01-16",4.1,"090116. A beer with a name that is difficult to pronounce but that is the only downside to this beer, not that this is even really a downside. I purchased this bottle from Cool Wine in Hobart a while ago and thought it was about time that I drank it.

The awesome looking label on the bottle certainly catches your eye and the label is both colourful and intriguing. While the outer packaging is very good it is the beer inside the bottle that really makes you sit up and take notice. 

Black as coal with a smooth even thin layer of tan foam and aromas of dark chocolate. Cocoa, vanilla and toffee fill the nose. This is a beer that is visually pleasing and from the first mouthful to the last you get nothing but great flavour.

Much like the aroma the flavour is all vanilla, toffee and dark chocolate. While the beer is thin in the mouth it is as smooth as velvet and fills the mouth with flavour and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"

Low carbonation, body is thin, watery mouthfeel, with a hint of smokiness in the attack that fades into a milk chocolate feeling. A little bit of roast flavor finishes this light, watery stout. Nothing really special here, defenitely lacks complexity and intensity for a dry stout.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","lefossoyeur"
1671,"2009-09-11",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2010 Tap at Mascouches Oktoberfest.  Divine texture, good chocolate-roasted-coffee maltiness but the hopping is somewhat pretty discreet.  Still, respectable.  7-4-6-4-15 ADDED:  On tap at Saint-Bock.  Wo!  What happened here?  Change of recipe, freshness, my new affection for this brewer working subconsciously in my mind?  The pint I had was simply amazing, with a lot of depth, and with a lot of torrefied malt, velvety chocolate notes, a surprisingly smooth texture and an all and all great balance.

1671,"2009-08-23",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2011 This is a wow stout for texture, too bad it lacks the taste to back up this superior creamy palate. Roasted malts in the nose with a watery taste. Some subltle hops with chocolate and caramel syrup. OK.

Dry-hopped with Citra, its a totally different beer. The powerfull Citra hops gives personnality and backbone to this well made but too sublte brew. A very nice mix of herbal, lemony hops with the malts. 4 out of 5.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

1671,"2006-09-04",2.8,"Nitro head tops the black body. They didnt go low on the specialty malts as a bold roasty statement enters the nose with little else being noticeable. So you find yourself with rather one-dimensional dark chocolate, possibly nutty nuances and globally mild. Active carbonation, very light body and quite watery texture. An honest stout that may lack a bit of firmness in the mouthfeel department, but it only makes it more drinkable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1671,"2006-05-08",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2007 Any first impressions?
-A lofty nitro head duly sits upon the opaque blackness.
-Tiramisu icing and chocolate are dispersed by the malt profile.
-Coffee bean roastiness, molasses sweetness and cocoa are found, rendering more complexity.
-The body is creamy and full now; a great improvement of what it was when first brewed.

What if you dig deeper?
-This recipe has matured greatly since its first Guinness-like attempts..
-Fruity esters accentuate the pleasure.
-The finish is balanced and quite pleasant.
-The result is now a chewy quencher, highly enjoyable for the stout lover.

Subtle notes of coffe that mellows out into milk chocolate with a hazelnut finish.  Not bad.
Mocha flavors with little cocoa sprinkles, body is quite light and the bitter finish is coffee-like and mild.  A sessionable if not spectacular stout that Guinness lovers will dig, I tend to like mine with a little more substance.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
