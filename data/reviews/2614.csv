However the beer is much more light bodied than Maisels original, a sort of Maisels Lite if you like. The flavors are less pronounced than the original; the banana remains and is accompanied by a light lemon bitterness, particularly in the aftertaste. It is the excellent aroma which keeps drawing you back in and reminding you that this is really a Weizen.

2614,"2010-04-03",2.5,"Kristallweizen is a relatively rare style compared to other German wheat beers and thats a good thing because the style, in essence, is a crap version of an ordinary hefeweizen. Here we see that rather than a distinctive cloudy pale beer w/ a big, long lasting head, we have a beer with a head. The nose does not suffer so much; its big and tends toward cloves more so than bananas. The texture, while it still has that oily wheat feel, is punctuated by fizzy lager-like carbonation rather than a smooth cushion of fine bubbles.  It does finish well w/ a crisp bitterness and a lingering taste of citrus on the palate.

Appearance: Pours very clear, pure and perfectly clear body texture, body is sunny - strawy yellow, pale gold in colour reminding Dortmunder/Helles or Pale Lager, carbonation of the body is moderate, head is initially medium slowly decreasing to small, snowy white and frothy in texture.
Aroma: Front is clear, wheaty with built in malty notes, gently grainy touch, slightly sweet, gently bready, pure, not strong notes of banana, clove and yeast as in typical hefeweissbier, much weaker than ’Maisel’s Weisse Original’. 
Flavour: Mineral, soft, very clean, pure, gently sweet, very pronounced flowery - hoppy nose, slight sweetness reminds one of a Dortmunder/Helles as well as in terms of carbonation of the body. Finish duration is quite long. Notes of wheat, yeast but not that strong as in Hefeweizen, more influence of barley malt.

2614,"2004-10-29",3.6,"Clear golden colour with big white head. Aroma has a lot of banana and bubblegum. Flavor is also dominated by the sweetness from banana, there is also some butter in the taste. Palate is nice and thick.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","ThomasE"
2614,"2004-09-25",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2008 Bottle -  a forward banana aroma for a Kristall.   Perfect Kristall appearance - dark yellow and clear.  Flavor clean and crisp wheat malt (high carbonation) with only a slight banana flavor.  Probably the best one that is widely available.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2614,"2004-09-25",3.6,"Demonstrative banana and bubblegum notes riding sturdy, earthy yeast...Feathery apple cider hints surface once in a while atop this frothy, quenchable beauty...I really do not expect much more from this style and this one answered very aptly...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2614,"2004-09-24",3.0,"Pretty good, but maybe a little too light.  It is certainly sweet, but lacks a touch more of the depth that I like in a German wheat beer.  Very drinkable, though.","Frankfurt, GERMANY","mstockton"
2614,"2004-09-22",3.5,"Banana bread and a touch of butter in the aroma. Clear golden body with dense white head that lasts nicely. Banana flavour is somewhat subdued as compared with the aroma. Wheat flavour stands out nicely. Excellent, strong, prickling carbonation. Thick, smooth, wheaty mouthfeel.

2614,"2004-09-21",3.3,"Clear gold colour. Big, lasting, foamy, lacey head. Very nice. Bready, yeasty aroma. Bready taste, some yeast, some hints of banana. Good carbonation. Bitter finish. Quite good for a Kristall.","Herdecke, GERMANY","dortmunder"
2614,"2004-09-20",3.6,"Clear pale gold color, thin white head. Aroma of bananas, wheat, herbs and maybe yeast. Crisp flavor of wheat, banana and spices. Light to medium body, creamy texture. A good, refreshing and enjoyable beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

2614,"2004-09-16",3.3,"50cl. bottle:  This one pours a clear, golden color.  There was a fairly large white frothy head, but it did subside quickly.  Quite a bit of bubbles in the beer.  I get a bit of clove and banana to the nose.  A slightly lighter beer, with notes of wheat, banana and a weak spiciness.  Maybe a touch of dryness/sourness in the aftertaste.  Good, but Ill stick with a regular Hefe.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"

2614,"2004-07-28",3.0,"Real good. nice crisp well round wheat flavours. Has a saaz hop flavour, like a wheat pilsner. Appaently the bottle conditioned version is more robus and tastier.

2614,"2004-06-29",4.0,"I was quite impressed with this one.  Has a clean, light amber look to it, and flavor not too unlike the hefeweizen they make, except the feel & finish is more ale-like.","York, SC via NJ, South Carolina, USA","HighlanderOne"

2614,"2004-03-25",3.2,"Sparkling clear golden body topped by a large densely packed foam white head. The aroma is wheat, banana, light spice, and sweetnees.

Medium-bodied; Sweet flavour of bananas, wheat and some light pepper/clove spiceyness. Bubble gum is noticeable in the aftertaste. Overall, a nice 'authentic' kristall, great to try!

2614,"2003-08-29",2.0,"Much worse than the regular hefeweizen. Why was it so salty? Tell me that! I dunno what happens in the filtering process here, but they gotta fix that up. How could a beer so great in its unfiltered guise be so dumb as a kristall. For me it's confirmation that filtered beers are for the same type of people who like pulp free ornage juice or crust free bread or soemthing wack like that.","Walgett, NSW, AUSTRALIA","Betty"

2614,"2003-07-17",3.2,"Man, do I love wheat beers in the summer. Nice golden blond body with that weissbier nose - banana, clove, slight hops. Drink this in the proper glass and benefit from the foamy and pillowy head that forms. Lacking the yeasty taste that a standard hefeweizen has this seems ""thinner"" but is still damn good on a hot night. Not very complex on the tongue. Finishes well with little aftertaste.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
2614,"2003-05-12",3.1,"OK wheat beer aroma - bit of citrus and honey in the hops, but also a bit pungent/skunky. Light golden straw clear with huge foamy lacing white head. Light carb but bubbly. Watery body. Kind of weak and watery in taste. Filtering it takes out the tasty body you normally get in a Hefeweizen. Was citrusy and refreshing. Sweet light wheat finish and mild sweet after.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
2614,"2003-04-05",3.2,"Straw-colored, topped by a big white froth.  Aroma is wheat, light lemon, and faint grassiness.  Taste is medium sweet, lemon tart, banana, wheat, and a trace of bitterness.  Somewhat watery palate, and somewhat overly carbonated.  Pleasant summery beer.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2614,"2003-03-30",3.1,"Lemony aroma with a clear, golden color.  Frothy, lasting, white head.  Sweet, fruity flavor with an even finish.  Not bad, but I prefer the unfiltered.","AE, GERMANY","guzzler"
2614,"2003-01-30",2.8,"A filtered wheat beer and in my opinion they have filtered out the taste.  Pours clear with a slight haziness.  The head is frothy and white.  Aroma, and I know this sound weird, but is almost like melons, not watermelon or cantaloupe, but a hint of honeydew.  None of the bananna or spice usually associated with a wheat.  Taste is pretty much like a lager, fairly light not unpleasant but not what I was expecting.  Very crisp.  I prefer the unfiltered wheats.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
2614,"2003-01-21",3.1,"Fairly strong wheat/yeast nose with hints of cloves. Clear pale gold color and a fizzy head. Crisp clean taste without loosing the typical wheat beer flavors entirely. Accessible  maybe even for someone who does not normally like hefeweizens. Enjoyable for those who do as well.","GERMANY","pivo"
2614,"2003-01-19",3.3,"Yeast, banana and strong lemony nose. Golden color with a little foamy head on top. Soft carbonation. Tastes lemony, like banana and yeast too. Pricks on the tongue so badly that it disturbs the mouthfeel - tastebuds. But it is still nice. Good Biergarten summer beer.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
2614,"2002-12-15",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2003 This wheat beer pours a clear, deep yellow color with a big, lingering, white head. The aroma is lemony with hints of yeast and a tad bit of banana.

Very refreshing, however I prefer the un-filtered version.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"

Medium body with very nice smooth palate. Start is a bit weak but middle and finish are much better; slightly sweeter but still refreshing, very smooth, sour dough, grainy, even white winish. The straight Weisse is a better beer for my tastes.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"

2614,"2002-01-29",3.6,"Im trying to determine the reason for the Star of David on the label... Its true that Maisel could be a Jewish name.  Its also true that the brewerys hometown of Bayreuth is littered with historical notes of Nazism and anti-semitism, most notably the home of flaming anti-semite Richard Wagners music festival, a hang out for Nazis. Thanks to VENOM, I know now its the brewers star with no known historical relation to Judaism or kosher purity. The beer is the filtered version of the dampfbier (steam beer) that may be the actual reason for the name of Anchor Steam by its German founders and not the popular belief that it was the gassy hiss of the kegs that was the reason for the name. Dunno... The beer has a lot of Bavaria in there. Sweet but little residual sugar, high acid, soft, some lemon and tannic zing, a very distinct perfume and musty books aroma. This is interesting.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
