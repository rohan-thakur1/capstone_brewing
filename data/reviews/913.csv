913,"2016-12-09",3.6,"6-pack. Starting last night, almost gone. If you뇼e been looking for 25 years for alternatives to industrial beer, especially if you live on the west coast, Anchor Steam might hold a special place in your liver. It certainly does in mine. Until last night, I hadn뇺 heard that they had rolled out variants of it. I뇴 grateful for the chance to revisit an old favorite. Some old favorites are solid mainstream beers, as opposed to masterpieces, and this one is definitely of the solid variety, like it뇹 progenitor. Pours a slightly hazy medium amber with a dense and sudsy off white head that settles quickly to foam. Got that tangy Steam nose; kinda doughy, kinda vegetal, kinda weird, but in a quirky and likeable way rather than a QA problem way. It뇹 easy to see why this beer was always unconventional and ""wrong,"" and they still went with it. There뇹 an herbal note to this variant. Slightly nutty mid palate, lots of tangy vegetal and doughy notes there too. Gets dry and shows a little white wine near the finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Light to Medium-bodied; Strong grassy and bittered malt flavour - just like the original with some grassy and more floral notes than before and a light sweetness from caramelised sugars and that pungent, spent grain flavour that is noticeable miles away. Aftertaste shows some dry bitter hops, a little malt flavour with nuts and earth by far the strongest and finishing well and relatively pungent.

Flavor doesn뇺 seem to be nearly as bitter as the regular version, which surprises me a little. Clean palate. Decent beer. But, it뇹 nothing that is ""hit me over the head"" good.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"
913,"2016-09-24",3.8,"Yeah, it뇹 a good beer. Probably better than the original, but I haven뇺 had the original in a long while so it뇹 hard to compare.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
913,"2016-09-21",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2016 Shared 12 oz. bottle from distributor rep at Lunar Brewing Co., poured to snifters showing a hazed, orangey gold color, with a presentable layer of soft white foam, and spots & strands of lacing. The nose was floral & fruity, with light malt sweetness, and a touch of grass & greenery. Medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste added some low, earthy bitterness, and finished pleasantly crisp. More to the aroma & finish than the original, and remained very sessionable.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
913,"2016-09-18",3.5,"Surprisingly refreshing. Didn't know exactly what to expect but the extra character on the finish makes me like this better than the original

913,"2016-09-17",3.2,"Smells a lot like regular Anchor Steam, only a bit skunkier; I wanted a bolder scent. Looks great, light bronze color with a very bright white head that leaves tons of lacing. Also tastes a lot like regular Anchor Steam, the dry hopping is evident but should be stronger. The aftertaste is a little off to me, kinda funky. This was a gimmick. Consider this a review for regular Anchor Steam which I like, so I can뇺 give it too bad of a score. The dry hopping does not make it better in any way; if anything it makes it worse.","Missouri, USA","coachd"
913,"2016-09-11",3.7,"12 ounce bottle. Amber orange pour capped by a huge rocky beige head. Subtle citrus hops in nose. Flavor is light sweet malt with dry bitter hops. At first fruity citrus, then spicy bitter, with peppery notes. Long dry bitter finish. Easy to drink. As promised, much more hop-centric than the original Anchor Steam.","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"
913,"2016-09-05",3.3,"Bottle in Seattle. Modest tan-white foam, slight hazed orange beer. Grassy, fruity hop with a lot of the malt coming through. Tobacco, fruity malt, bitter grain. Earthy, grassy, plenty of bitter by the finish. This takes the base beer in a different direction, a bit more pleasant, but I don뇺 love this. A bit harsh throughout.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
913,"2016-09-03",3.6,"Bottle from six pack at Trader Joe뇹. Hazy burnt orange colored pour. Aroma is peach and cantaloupe. Flavor is light peach/nectarine, citrus mist and bitter hops.","California, USA","MattH"
913,"2016-08-25",3.8,"355ml bottle. This is nowhere close to the original product. It still retains that ""steam"" charm but wow this is much dryer, the hops west coast, citrus and herb heavy , it just is damn fresh, crushable, and nice, drink it FRESH.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
913,"2016-08-25",2.5,"I have an idea! Lets take a meh beer and add shitty hops to it! What could possibly go wrong? +++ Sampled on draft at 3R6P this beer poured a bronze color with a large foamy orange-white head that left excellent lacing. The aroma was very faint with a bit of citrus, perfume and cactus. The flavor was bitter, dry and perfumey with a bit of citric hops and absolutely nothing else. Medium length hoppy finish. Medium body. Meh.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
913,"2016-08-24",3.6,"Pours a clear copper with a frothy white head. Aroma was slightly grassy, herbal and earthy hops, still has the caramel maltiness of the OG. Flavors were on point with straight Steam with a touch of hops. Medium mouthfeel, mouthfeel was silky smooth and well rounded in Anchor fashion. Good stuff, I think that the dry hop wasn뇺 over done. The integrity of the original remains intact.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
913,"2016-08-19",3.8,"The beer pours crystal clear copper with a sudsy dense beige head. The aroma has the mildly toasted malt of the original, smoothness, bread, caramel and such, but then has a more assertive herbal hoppiness. It has a medium body with some crispness and a good amount of carbonation. The taste starts like the aroma, but the hops are more up front with the herbal notes along with spiciness and grass. Really nice. While its way more hopped that the original steam, its pretty well balanced by todays standards.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
913,"2016-08-17",3.8,"Bottle from Total Wine in Sacramento, CA. Pours coppery gold with a creamy off-white head. Med body. Flavor is that maltiness of California Common, but there뇹 some interesting hop flavor. Not super strong, but somewhat complex. I뇳l go with floral and mildy earthy. Making me think of the hoppier English Ales. Tasty in its way.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
