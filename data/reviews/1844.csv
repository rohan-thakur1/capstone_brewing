1844,"2016-06-28",3.9,"Sampled on draft at 3R6P this beer poured a vibrant dark honey color with a large fluffy orange-white head that left good lacing. The aroma was sweet and yeasty with sugar and golden fruit notes. The flavor was tangy, sweet and mildly boozy with notes of yeast, bread, table sugar and golden fruit. Medium length finish. Moderately full bodied. Well done.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"

1844,"2016-06-20",3.9,"On draft at Tap 25. It pours a golden yellow color with a creamy, frothy off white head. A golden Maibock! One of my favs. The aroma has some honey and bread. Light notes of citrus and floral hops. The flavor is full and malty with more honey, bread, light notes of pear, melon, flowers and citrusy hops. The hops are tasted mainly in the finish. Clean, with a silky mouthfeel. Lightly oily. Strong bitterness and good honey bread malt upfront. Great stuff. Super tasty and satisfying.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

1844,"2016-06-17",3.6,"Draft. Golden pour. This is a by-the-books maibock for sure, not super hoppy but a nice crish orange herbal hop character and a heavy bready malty body.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1844,"2016-06-11",3.9,"Pint at Star Bar. This is a brilliant amber with a crystal clear body. Man, Alesmith killed this style. Very clean and malty aroma with a kiss of noble hops and very mild bready lager yeast notes. The palate is smooth and medium full. Taking a drink is like biting into a loaf of bread and following it up with fresh roasted corn on the cob. A faint hint of toffee starts coming out. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a maibock.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
1844,"2016-05-29",3.4,"Clear bright golden with a sticky foamy white top. Crisp bready but also slightly grassy nose. Bready and toasty flavor with a earthy grassy and lagerish undertone, actually pretty complex but a little too full of lager yeast.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1844,"2016-05-15",3.6,"Draught at the brewery. Pours clear gold with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Aroma is cereal and grainy malt, light earthy and spicy hops with light kettle caramelized notes. Flavor is moderate, lightly sweet grainy and cereal malt with light earthy and spicy hops and bitterness and a sweet finish. Full body and medium carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
