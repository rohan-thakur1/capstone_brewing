3305,"2017-02-13",3.9,"Pours a vibrant, clouded golden color with a froth, medium sized white head.

Smells of hay, wet grass, white bread dough, young herbs and a strawy sweet whiff.

Has an effervescent, refreshing carbonation, among a light body, showcasing a mineralic quality during the finish.

Has a velvet beginning with subtle, bready malts, hay and a note of young garden herbs, developing a slightly mineralic, lively carbonation, which turns maltier, sweeter during mid palate with straw and an aqueous softness after the initial carbonation effervescence. Turns surprisingly dry during the finish with bready malts and a note of dry leaves, overcoming the malts easily.

This is a winner, subtle and versatile, very entertaining as for its prominent hop dryness, tied together by a world class balance.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3305,"2011-12-14",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2014 Numerous gravity pours at the brewpub and keller are markedly improved from my first few bottle samples years ago. Hopcentric and lemony with Spalt, yeasty, rustic, nice pils malt, good balance, pretty clean. Could use a touch more refinement, but all in all this is very lovely.  Bottle, Purchased at Landbierparadies in Nurnberg, Best Before 3/15/12, consumed in early November: Light chestnut. Fragmented ivory foam.   Dirty nose of wort and grape and lesser notes of spicy licorice-tinged hops and an earthy dry maltiness. Obviously underattenuated. Soft carbonation. Opens with sharp earthy malts atop an overbearing base of residual sugar. Some graininess is apparent right from the start, which gradually heightens in intensity. Deeply earthy notes of sassafras, burnt wood and licorice root lend an unpleasant bitterness that clashes with the cleaner elements while virtually leeching every trace of saliva from the palate. Finishes with a caustic rubbery astringency and everlasting flavors of wort. Something is evidently awry here because this is severely underattenuated and sloppy.

The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by a small white head
In long: Another lager with a rustic character, not quite like the farmhouse of the Wagner-Bräu we drank just before, this one emanates a sensation of countryside field, wild flowers and fresh hay.  Taste of fresh hay, straws, grassy hops, a light spiciness, a mild fruity tartness.  When fresh (this was fresh) this is one to drink by the gallon.  Another underrated session lager.

Appearance : Slightly hazy yellow with white foamy head. Awesome head retention.

Aroma : Great citrusy hops with herbal notes. Nice malt. Some hay and light notes of humid grain. Nice citrusy/fruity notes. A bit earthy.

Taste : Great chewy malts with lots of herbal hops. Citrusy notes too. Finish is rather bitter (especially for the style). Light spicy notes, light pine. Carbonation is delightfully soft.

Overall : Wow. Very nice beer. I dont really know why I rated it so averagely last time... Very tasty and very complex. Nice farmhouse character with the wet grain notes.

3305,"2007-07-30",3.6,"At the brewpub, served in a mug but as far as I could see it was cloudy golden with a white head. Sweet, heavily hopped aroma gives lots of pine, citrus, fruit and slightly sweet malt. Bitter flavours, also hop dominated in a good way... balanced but assertive is another way to put it.

3305,"2006-05-24",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2017 Impressions from different bottles and taps:
-Herbal, earthy and grassy hop perfumes are showcased, all coalescing in a friendly, never overpowering manner.
-There is plenty of sticky foam to cover the very pale blond.
-A complex continuum of citrusy, floral, peppery, and grassy hop petals form a botanical garden the likes of which Id like to revisit more often.
-A touch of sulfur adds to the complexity, being quite harmonious with the hay-like malts and herbal hops. 
-The ample effervescence manages to remain cushiony and comfortable.
-The lightly honeyed malts are well dried out, adding a rustic, hay-like touch.
-The finish is full of peppery, earthy hop bitterness, leaving a poignant aftertaste.
-Simply put, this is an absolutely marvelous session beer for hopheads imbued with an unmistakable rustic personality.
