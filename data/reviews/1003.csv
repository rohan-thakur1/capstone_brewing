1003,"2017-03-31",3.7,"Pours a slightly hazy golden brown on tap with thin ring of bubbly white head that leaves light lace. Aroma of nice sweet barrel notes with a hint of funk. Taste is like Belgian light fruits with a hint of musty wood and vanilla. Solid, but like the regular better.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"

1003,"2017-02-02",3.5,"From notes. Somehow this drinking session evaded my developments. Enjoyed at Dougs house on October 28. 500 mL bottle. The pour is a nice coppery gold color with a thicker white head that slowly recedes with a little lace. The aroma is pretty good. There is a light citrus and tropical fruitiness up front with a little bit of sweetness and a hint of metallic malt on the back end. Its interesting. There is a light Belgian yeast that I dont necessarily care for. The flavor is very similar. The oak foudres do a little interesting thing with this. Its a light, crisp blonde with a nice oak and a hint of metallic malt on the fruit. Its a little sweeter and interesting. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and metallic aftertaste.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1003,"2016-12-19",3.7,"Pours a light blonde witha head that fades quickly. Aroma is of green apple, citrus, herbs, raisin. Tastes is very small. Not a bad thing but, not overly complicated. sufficiently fruity and spicy but very mild. This is a very nice tripel.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","BadAprilia1000"
1003,"2016-11-25",3.9,"500ml bottle from Chevy Chase Wine and Liquors. Hazy golden orange color with a small white head. Aroma is really nice, great Belgian yeast and oak, black pepper, brett, tropical and floral notes. The flavor has a touch of sweetness yielding to a bretty tartness. Medium-bodied, crisp, decently carbonated. Nice one overall.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

1003,"2016-11-04",3.6,"Good. Not great. No real hint of the barrel, to my taste. It pours hazy blond, average head, average carbonation. The aroma is typical Belgian, rich esters, bananas, cloves, etc. The flavor is pretty much the same. The finish is richer and fuller than many Belgians, though, so it gets points for that.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"
1003,"2016-10-16",3.7,"Bottle poured into a pilsner glass showing well filtered neon yellow with half a finger of clean white foam. The nose shows a strong Belgian yeast influence with a light tart note. The palate is light bodied and well carbonated. Very light tartness with a strong Belgian yeast influence throughout almost emulates a moderate bakery dough sweetness. All flavors come together harmoniously and gently balanced.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
1003,"2016-10-12",3.7,"375 ml. bottled 05.31.2016. Mostly clear gold with a film of creamy foam. Aroma is earthy honey, funky cheese, fruity wine and a touch of resin. Tastes of peach, spicy bread, white wine and bubblegum. Finishes with notes of white pepper and toasted wood. Light-medium body has medium carbonation and a nice balance.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

1003,"2016-09-06",3.7,"Sampled at Monks, pours a lightly hazy golden with light head and sporadic lace. This one is similar to the base with lots of belgian yeast and fruit but a nice addition of oak and other dusty type notes. Lots of brett being noticed. Lighter carbonation.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
1003,"2016-09-05",4.1,"Bottle from Mile High. Pours a fairly clear gold until the end of the bottle. A very firm, dense, white head forms. Smells great. The use of the barrel is perfect. Light funk, spices, pineapple, wool, with a gentle oak background make up the aroma. The palate is super creamy with spot on carbonation. Tastes pleasantly tart with a bit of funk and subdued oak to balance. The finish is very dry. Another one knocked out of the park by Wicked Weed.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1003,"2016-08-29",3.9,"Hazy golden/copper with a thin white ring of foam, giving off a bright herbal and Oaked aroma of Belgian blonde malt and a light Belgian yeast ester. Bright Belgian blonde flavor as well thats funky and slightly bretty, dusty and slightly fruity on the finish. Really pleasant and nuanced and clean and complex.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1003,"2016-08-28",4.0,"Bottle. Pours turbid straw with 2-fingers of off-white head. Nose is yeasty funk, oak, hops, citrus. Tastes dry, floral, hoppy, oaky, like a dry white wine with a champagney body and more white grape flavors. Great stuff.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
