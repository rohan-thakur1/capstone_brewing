4517,"2015-04-12",4.1,"Return trip to Strahov - feeling triumphant after the castle tour and long climb up the hill. Found a great corner booth shared table and settled in. Started with the Easter special - dry hopped version if I recall - a nice refreshing ""hoppy"" (thats your visit from the Easter punny - count it) beer for the occasion.

Amber with a mini haze and white topping. Malts lead the way in the aroma and taste, biscuity and light, some floral hops follow along. A mild citrus hint arrives in the mouth but this is predominantly a maltier brew than a hop dominated beer: nice enough blend I suppose but wanted more oomph. The finish was slightly bitter but enough to get excited about.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

4517,"2011-03-28",3.7,"Klásterní Pivovar Strahov, Prága. Mély arany szín, hatalmas tömör hófehér hab. Illatában a finom malátás-füves aromák mellett nagyon érezhető a gyümölcsösség, ami aztán az ízében is előkerül, egyből a finom maláta után megy át almás, kicsit citrusos ízvilágba, és a komló is gyümölcsösen fut végig az ízlelőbimbókon, valamint a kenyeres, finom utóízében is érezhető. A 13-as testesség is érződik, egyáltalán nem veszti el karakterét még hosszabb italozás után sem, száraz, élénken szénsavas, tehát egy majdnem tökéletes, klasszikus cseh pilzeni, de nem is vártam mást ezen a helyen.","Budapest, HUNGARY","mattphilips"

Spicy Saaz hops aroma with notes of citrus and bready malt. Light, clean body with flavors of spiced hops, bready malts and orange rinds. The finish is fruity with a lingering Saaz hops aftertaste.

4517,"2008-04-07",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2008 Back from a Czech Republic pub-crawl this is part of my express ratings for the typical Světlý 11°- (Czech light Pils), Světlý 12°+ (Czech Pils), Polotmavý (Czech Amber Lagers) and Tmavý (Czech Black Lagers).  Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at brewpub (Klásterní Pivovar Strahov, Prague)
The look: Cloudy golden body with a large white head
To me a typical Czech Světlý 12° and above is: Well malted body with plenty of biscuits and cereals.  Sweetness level is in the light-medium range with some honey flavours and a light caramel presence (3/4 honey, 1/4 caramel).  Fruity flavour limited to a light citrus flavour.  Medium carbonation.  Finish is dry and moderately bitter with a light citric touch.  After-taste of dry grassy/herbal hops with a light dry spiciness character.
This one: As above, but more intense, perfect balance, perfect everything.  My favourite standard (non-oak barrel aged) pilsner ever.  Puts my beloved Amère À Boire to shame.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4517,"2008-03-26",3.9,"En fût. Pinte dégustée directement à la brasserie. Arôme: Forte présence dhoublon avec une pointe de pêches. Apparence: La couleur est blonde orangée. Saveur: Goût dhoublons légèrement amer et de céréales. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Amertume dhoublon en arrière goût. (Rating #1514)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
4517,"2008-03-24",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2009 My Bottom Line:
Spicy, grassy, piney Saaz soars out of the sturdy biscuity hay, leading to a blooming herbal hop finale where balance resides and quenching is epitomized. Intense enjoyment is inevitable with this quality of Bohemian Pilsener as far as Im concerned.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A De Dolle-like tower of foam mushrooms over the opaque orangey blond.
-Effervescence is frothy and serves the plentiful flavors quite well.
-I love it when equilibrium is reached through muscular flavoring and effortless drinkability.
-This is a truly complex and festive beer, but it has the amazing ability to make you want to stop analyzing it.

4517,"2008-02-24",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2010 At the brewery again. Dark hazy amber with a billow of suds. Tangy Saaz and something subtly citrusy/mandarin-accented. Wafery afters.

A very well made, beautiful hoppy brew............
P.S. This beer is different from the 14º Easter Special, because of the lower gravity and the lower ABV.........","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
