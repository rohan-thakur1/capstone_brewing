2583,"2012-09-15",3.5,"November 24, 2011 - with blankboy, jerc and mabel. 750ml bottle c/o J&K.  Its slightly hazy red with a reasonably large tan fizzy/foamy quick-diminishing head.  Definite sweet bourbon in the aroma, and alcohol, a little buttery (not diacetyl) - like a floral nutbrown, nice.  Taste is - oh, man - BOURBON, and butterscotch, sure wish I liked bourbon; somewhat restrained 10% alcohol presence, maybe a little fruity in behind.  Sticky, solid body, weak carbonation, finishes .... bourbon.  An extra point for ""rare""","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
2583,"2012-02-22",3.5,"[4150-20111124] 600mL bottle. Overly sweet and nutty wood barrel aroma. Black brown body with a quick creamy off-white head. Super whiskey sweet bourbon flavour has a long sweet boozy aftertaste. Full body. Good, solid. (8/3/7-/3/14) 3.5

2583,"2012-02-07",3.7,"Bottle [600ml] shared with HogTownHarry, jerc & mabel -- c/o j&m. Nov. 2011. Pours dark brown with a small diminishing frothy tan head. Aroma: Hmmm, I respect it but its not for me: Brown sugar, caramel malt, fruit, vanilla, bourbon and oak -- Im just not a huge fan of bourbon barrel-aging, too sweet for my liking. Flavour is preferable as it is somewhat more subtle with the barrel-aging qualities and its smoother then expected: Dark malt, vanilla, oak, light hops and brown sugar. Alcohols there but fairly well hidden. Medium bodied. A well made beer, but like I said I personally dont love B.A. beers.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
2583,"2011-11-27",3.7,"2011-11-24. Very dark brown body with a small frothy beige head. 3+ Strong vanilla barrel aroma, sweet, almost buttery notes in a not diacetyl kind of way. 7+ Flavour is similar, strong vanilla character, ligh herbal touches (from the bog myrtle?) quite sweet overall, lingering herbal notes, sweet vanilla bourbon. Not the kick in the groin that some barrel aged beers can be, but this one slowly smothers you. The bourbon is not overly strong, and is actually fairly enjoyable but it dominates to a degree that is a bit intense by the end of a glass. Rich smooth palate. Some lovely notes here, I enjoyed the overall profile of the barrel character, but a small glass ends up being lots.

eastern ontario gruit.

Second beer reviewed from the ""Greener future project"".

This beers potent 10% shows from, the fist sip, and thankfully isnt overpowering. It has a very malty aroma, strong nutty and caramel notes. Short finish making it a quick sweet bang. Emphasis on sweet. Low carbonation on this one, making it flat somewhat rapidly. While not much fizz is left it is still very paletable, and still feels powerful, potente. it has a nice medium bitterness to it, Somehow reminds me of a McEwan while almost not as malty, or a strong scottish ale.","Ontario, CANADA","LBarouf"
2583,"2011-10-02",4.0,"bottle from the brewery. dark brown with a small beige head that stays throughout the entire beer. very sweet aroma. loaded with bourbon is both the bouquet and the taste. the gruit adds somewhat of a medicinal, strong herbs kind of taste at the finish. very nice. body is full, not much carbonation. best as it warms. this is one hell of a beer from Beaus.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","godofsky"
2583,"2011-08-11",3.8,"Almost opaque dark brown with orange notes and a medium creamy beige head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma is dark malt, brown sugar, wood, bourbon, herbal notes, alcohol and a hint of leather.  Flavor is dark sweet malt, brown sugar, warming alcohol, herbal notes, wood, bourbon, and a hint of leather with a long wood and sweet finish. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a weird sensation of wood on the tongue. Very good beer.","Mirabel, Quebec, CANADA","Diogène"
2583,"2011-08-10",3.8,"Bottle - 660ml. Dark brown body with a thin off-white foamy/creamy head. Enjoyable malty/hoppy aroma with fruity and oaky hints. Taste hides the alcohol perfectly. It carries chocolate, brown sugar, fruity, and woody notes. Ends with a decent bittersweet, warming finish. Very good.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
2583,"2011-07-31",3.8,"Bottle. Pours dark brown, rather opaque. Form a smallish but creamy tan head. Low carbonation is obvious.
Aroma is mainly about oak and sherry, with good notes of mint, pepper, toffee, leaves and vanilla. 
Taste is intially somewhat sweet, which is replaced by sherry and spices as further down the bottle you get. 
Finale is not bitter at all, and is pretty much all about black pepper which subtly kicks in after the sip, and that comes more and more obvious. Pretty oily (and surprised of it as well).

All in all --- it made the Bog Father different, but not sure it made it better. The mud taste -- that was pretty strong in the Bog Father and nearly overwhelming with the Bog Water -- got a bit lost in the Bourbon casks. Its great, but I slightly prefer the Bog Father.

On a somewhat related topic, its the Barrel-aged Bog Father, and no the Barrel-age Bog Water.","Gatineau/St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","MXD"
2583,"2011-07-28",4.2,"Pours a thick, opaque dark red with a creamy, tan head possessing good retention. The nose is very syrupy and sweet with cherry blossoms, apples, bourbon, vanilla, spice, herbal aromas, nuts, mint, candy canes, pine, tree sap, hot chocolate, coca-cola, caramel fudge, and a bit of a phenolic medicinal note. Possesses a slightly oily mouth feel with fairly low carbonation. Taste-wise, sweet and sour syrupy fruits ride on a wave of caramel malts, cola, bubble-gum and burnt toast, immediately followed by an explosion of delightful floral notes. Spice, pine, vanilla, bourbon, smoke, ash, and oak sit underneath the sweetness. Finishes very woody, dry and slightly bitter with a hint of dark chocolate. A very herbal and floral beer with a nice char to it from the bourbon barrel. The bourbon character becomes more evident as one gets further into the bottle and the sweetness fades.","Ontario, CANADA","C2H5OH"
2583,"2011-07-18",2.6,"This ones not really doing it for me. Up front aromas of malty stuff like caramel, burnt toast. Middle is smooth, but bourbon is kind of overwhelming in the end. Leaves an aroma behind that, for me, isnt entirely pleasant. Taste is very sweet, heavy. Very light bitterness from the burnt aromas maybe. Very full body with oily/creamy texture. Very little carbonation. Finish is astringent to bitter. Would maybe like to try the non-Bourbon version of the Bog Water to see if its just the bourbon that turned me off.","Ontario, CANADA","rejtable"
2583,"2011-07-10",4.3,"Bombastic bourbon flavor in every sip and smell. Just so saturated with typical vanilla and caramel flavors found in bourbon but at the same time smooth and flavorful with a silky texture.","Ontario, CANADA","d07c0m"
2583,"2011-07-08",3.7,"Bomber from the brewery, sold as part of the green future program. Dark brown with minimal tan head. Huge bourbon aroma - vanilla, booze, burnt caramel/toffee - overwhelms anything else but still quite great if you like bourbon. Nice carbonation, medium bodied, still mostly bourbon - sweet, bit of booze, toffee, bit of fruit. Finish is mostly bourbon, bit of wood and smoke. Quite good but needs a better balance between the base beer and the bourbon aging.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
