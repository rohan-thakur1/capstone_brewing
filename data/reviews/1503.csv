Nose is rather alcoholic (no surprise), licorice, umami, herbal, thick molasses, syrup de Liege, apple & licorice. Rather umami & licorice forward, there is sweetness & quite a lot of it which I am digging. Body is akin to flat syrup, sugar & cuberdons. Taste is licorice, flat, herbal, molasses, umami, upfront, luckily the finish carries red fruits, which balance the whole & save the beer, warming but not a much as you would expect. Fruit really helps it turning it into a pleasant sipper. Low oxidation evident. Bit too licorice, flat etc. to fully shine still. I liked the Ardmore BA version quite a bit more surprisingly.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
