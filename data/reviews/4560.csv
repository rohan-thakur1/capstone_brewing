4560,"2015-04-30",3.1,"Draught at the brewery on 4/18/15Bright but lightly pale gold body is clear with maybe a touch of chill haze. White head is small and recedes to cover.Hoppy immediately in the nose (floral, hay, grass, pepper) but with a strong doughy element (plaster, dough, vanilla). Light touches of honey are the extent of the malt. No alcohol, no astringency.Flavor is also bitter up front, nicely floral/grassy and with a lively carbonation that helps keep it very light but disperses quite quickly leaving the end rather watery (which seems appropriate for this small a beer). Light honey/white bread sweetness and maybe a touch of diacetyl, though its not strong and is almost masked by the hop acids. Fine, drinkable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Maybe a little sulfur, unfortunately. The mouthfeel is really my only real gripe here, but at less than 4% thats maybe expected? Pretty good maltiness and subtle hop bitterness. Lightly soapy. Pretty good biscuit quality, though.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

4560,"2009-06-10",4.1,"I was amazed how palatable this beer was. I found it compared favorably to Cerna Hora and even at 3.6%, the beer did not lack body or depht at all. Crisp, clean and oh, so refreshing. Over my previous visits, ever since this beer has been on tap, I kept ordering this beer pints after pints. No need to be guilty. I think this is lAmere a Boire best offering.

4560,"2009-05-27",3.6,"In short: A true to the style Světlý-light.  The first in North-America?  Very good.
How: Tap at brewpub (first batch ever)
The look: Clear dark blonde body topped by a long-lasting small white head
In long: Nose is full of noble hops with lots of dry grass and a little spicy twist.  Despite the 3.6% the beer doesnt feel watery at all.  Lots of cereals with a crisp/crunchy sensation.  A little dry lemon skin flavour adds a pleasant light acidity.  Light fruity notes of fresh apricots and bananas.  Carbonation could have been softer.  Finish is mildly bitter and moderately dry.  A very nice example of the style and Id even say that it is above average compared to what is available on tap in Czech Republic.  And at 3.5% heres a beer I dont have to drink my 6th pint through the opening of my underwear Im usually wearing on my head by the 6th pint.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4560,"2009-05-01",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2014 My Bottom Line:
Outgoing Saaz spiciness bounces and flutters all around this Světlé Výčepnís valiant bready cereals, creating a cushy, lovely example of old world drinkability. This little sister of Cerna Hora might very well be as satisfying for long sessions.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam laces atop the veiled blond.
-This has to be the first 10-degree Czech-style Pilsener brewed in northeastern America?
-Carbonation is soft and the body lean (but never thin), building an engaging mouthfeel.
-The finish is lightly bitter from the Saazs herbal character and a tad dry as well.
-A few more pints of this and I might fall in love just like I did with their Cerna Hora many years ago! Bravo! Now if they could brew it as often...;)
