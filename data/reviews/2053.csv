2053,"2017-06-21",3.5,"Aroma:

Slight/medium aroma of malts, caramel, yeast, fruit, hops and spices.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque orange/brown beer with no/a slight off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, yeast and fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops and spices.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Good balanced flavours, that never gets truly great at any point. Same goes for the aroma, but the appearance and palate are great.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

The appearance was a subtle hazy burnt orange color with a thin white foamy head that quickly dissipated. Light lingering lacing runs around the glass nicely.

The flavor brings everything together to produce a nice sticky sweetness running into the aftertaste with all previously mentioned flavors.

Starts out with some candy sugar, bubble gum, and a hint of tartness, then moves to citrus and a bit of bread, then ends with a short, sweeter aftertaste. Medium body with a medium-high carbonation.

2053,"2012-08-29",3.4,"Draught at Breukelen Bier Merchants Stillwater event.  Clear yellow beer.  Theres a strange egg with slight sulfer aroma that is fairly unpleasant...but doesnt completely ruin the beer.  Aromas a light cream, honey, floral, and what I thought was wheat but must be the spelt. The flavor is slightly tart, low bitterness, moderately sweet. The mouthfeel is tangy.  Its really nice and very refreshing...other than that odd sulfer thing.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
2053,"2012-08-27",3.5,"In short: A semi-rustic, yeasty and dusty dark blonde ale.  Nice 
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed fresh the day of purchase
The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a medium off-white head with medium retention
In long: Nose is like smelling an old dusty rug over sun dried hay and dried orange peels and flowers.  Taste is similar. A very yeasty beer with a dusty character, dried fruits, lots of dried flowers, a bit of acidity, a fun spciness.  All that served over dry salted crackers.  There is a Saison-ish rusticity happening with the yeast but Carbonation is very very lively, borderline aggressive.  Nice beer.  Im entering this rating late, it is past midnight, and if you are reading this right now I know why you are still awake, stop it, youre gross.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2053,"2012-08-22",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
Multiple herbs and cereals whirl around this farmhouse brews rustic profile, as citrusy notes get catapulted by excited effervescence.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam caps the cloudy amber.
-Rye is more apparent to me than spelt in this brew.
-This is pretty drinkable once you get used to the rusticity.
-There is A LOT of yeast in the bottle. Hard to pour a decent second glass.
-This is not unlike Hopfenstarks Saison Station 16.

2053,"2012-07-02",3.6,"Enjoyed on-tap @ The Bridge Tap House & Wine Bar in St. Louis, MO for $9. Tapped from the ""Dark"" Looking Tap Handle from Stillwater into a 12oz Pint Glass. Stillwaters 750mL bottles are ALWAYS over $15 so I decided to try this on-tap first.

Aroma- Tons of complexity comes from this brew. Huge spices and a fresh/fruit blend is included. Bit of clove as well. Super potent! 

Appearance- Received with a 1.5 finger head that has good head retention. Has a deep golden colored body but clear. Leaves thick frothing behind. 

Flavor- VERY malty and almost a deep grain flavor from the beginning.  Spices then come in with a bit of pepper and then prickles at the finish with slight bitterness. 

Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, High Carbonation, Effervescent, Sweet Spices, and then a mixed fruit flavor finishes on the palate. 

Overall Impression- A decent Saison by Stillwater/Brewers Art but not worth the price... I havent seen this in bottle shops yet but wont be looking to purchase it.  Not even taste/flavor for me. The spices were a good contribution to the beer but needed more character.","Ballwin, Missouri, USA","DConMan"

2053,"2011-12-20",4.0,"Serving: 750 ml. bottle from State Line Liquors.  It pours a hazy honey color with a decent head of white foam.  The nose has a good bit of yeast and light  notes of pithy citrus.  The flavor has a rather unusual taste that I cant quite place.  It leans more towards the malty side with a little honey and yeast.  Its light on the palate with gentle notes of orange and flowers.  Rather tasty and well balanced.  Light body with a medium amount of smooth carbonation.  The finish is light and lingering with a touch of fruity citrus.

Very floral, almost perfumey nose in places, with the rye and spice coming on as almost an afterthought. Lively, spicey palate is enjoyable and tends to bring out more complexity in the flavors. Theres spicy wheat, grain, and herbal notes in there along with dry hops, bitter fruits, and a bright floral note in the finish. Very earthy and refreshing.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

2053,"2011-11-17",3.5,"A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a light amber hue that shows a brilliantly clear, pale amber tinged, full gold hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells floral and fruity with notes of hibiscus, red pears, perhaps a touch of floral apple and a general flower nectar that displays lots of honey-like notes.  This up front character is supported by some spicy white pepper notes, touches of ginger, a touch of mustiness and a solid phenolic character that is more spice than clove (though some of the latter too).

Spritzy and carbonated up front this serves as a nice foil to the ample sweetness; much of the latter is perceived, accentuated by the ample floral and fruit notes in the flavor.  Sweet fruit notes of hibiscus, Macintosh apple, some floral pear, a soft berry character, lots of flower nectar notes and of course a solid honey like character (without the medicinal sweetness that honey has though).  There is a slight spiciness towards the finish that has white pepper notes, a touch of young ginger, some phenolic notes in the finish that leans towards plastic perhaps a touch of clove and a slight mustiness.

The nose and the flavor lean a bit too much towards the fruity and floral side of things; it needs more spiciness and / or funkiness to balance out this super fruit and floral character that is on show so well in this beer.  This is a touch unbalanced, but in the end is pretty tasty; actually it really reminds me a lot of a Saison I made with Hibiscus, it too really needed some balancing funkiness or spiciness in it.  I wonder if the standard French Saison yeast was used in here, I find that this yeast doesnt supply the bite and balance that my favorite Saison yeasts are able to supply.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

T - Starts off with a kick of banana yeasty flavor and some light spices. Through the middle, the spices get a bit richer with some more earthy and floral elements coming through.

2053,"2011-07-07",4.1,"Draft. Pours golden orange with an off white head. Fruity and floral aroma, with herbal and lighter lemony citric notes. The flavor has spicy yeast, fruit, and nice flowery notes. Really good.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
2053,"2011-06-26",3.9,"On tap at The Thirsty Monk in Asheville.  Pours an intense golden orange, with a hint of red, as if just a hint of hibiscus was thrown in the mix, and the taste and nose suggest perhaps the same... but just a bit.  Nose shows more honey and mixed interesting grain.  A bit of hay/barnyard and floral notes.  Lots of citrus.  Similar taste, but a bit more sweet and fruity.  Intense and subdued at the same time.  Soft palate.  Great.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
