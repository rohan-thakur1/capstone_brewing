739,"2017-06-08",3.5,"Can from Casual Pint. Pours out a thick, deep amber with a tall head. Grassy hops are in the aroma with very heavy rye. This is backed up by caramel notes and a distant soapiness. Mouthfeel is medium with pleasant carbonation. Tons of rye gives the flavor a satisfying hearty spice. Combined with the hops, it seems a tad metallic, but not bad. Citrus starts to come out in the finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
739,"2017-04-30",4.4,"By their very nature, hops can be pretty overwhelming. Sometimes that means that Rye IPAs end up tasting like regular IPAs. Thats not the case with Another Way to Rye. This orange-brown beer has a lot of grassy, spicy rye. The hops dont get outdone by any means, though. Theres a lot of pithy citrus and earth. Long bitter finish. The rye and aggressive hops make this beer intense, but its still approachable. This is one of the better Tennessee beers Ive gotten to try.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
739,"2016-12-22",3.5,"Tingly and lingering like a good rye IPA should be, but the sweet malt center might be a little too heavy for its own good. Gets thick in the middle, a tad syrupy with a deep caramel vein, until the piney hop finish rouses all the loafers. Not bad, but could use a little more vitriol.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

739,"2012-09-13",4.1,"Growler fill from Libation Station in Johnson City.

Poured into a pint glass, appearance is a very slightly hazy medium copper with almost a bit of a ruby tint.

The aroma is really wonderful. Tons of pine and citrus from the hops but also a nice malt base with a definite rye spice.

The flavor is extremely hoppy up front with significant bitterness along with pine/citrus hop flavor. Malt quickly rushes in with rye up front with some caramel underneath. There is even some very faint hints of coffee/chocolate. I can really tell there is tons of rye in this. Mouthfeel is very slick and oily. Carbonation is a little low although that could be a product of the growler fill.

Overall, a very impressive brew from a brewery I have never heard of. Awesome to see another Tennessee brewery and I look forward to trying more beers from Turtle Anarchy.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"
739,"2012-09-03",3.2,"Growler fill from Whole Foods Cool Springs. Dark golden brown on the pour. The head is very thin. Not carbonated as well as I would like. Of course that may be Whole Foods fault. Luckily the carbonation level is fine on the palate. Still a bit light which makes the beer a bit syrupy. Nose of rye and spice and plenty of hops. Tastes pretty good. Nice bitterness from the hops. Rye malt is nice here. Not overdone in anyway. Though it is a bit straight forward and simple. Good.","Brentwood, Tennessee, USA","MmmcKay"
