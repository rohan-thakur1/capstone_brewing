3837,"2017-02-23",3.6,"Crisp, slightly hazy golden coloured body with a dense, thick, five centimetre tall pure white head that fades fairly quickly to a single centimetre. Aroma of tart brett, crisp wheat and light malt and a bit of lemons and salt with a rich funk and definite yeastie kick - very nice. Medium-bodied; Deep rich malt flavours with a pungent kick of astringent medicine and funk, but the alcohol and dryness really comes throughout. Aftertaste is almost all pure brett, funk and grass - pungent with a good deal of alcohol, grain and herbs - very bitter and long-lasting. Overall, a much stronger and fuller flavoured beer than is typically made by the brewery. That said, it had its pungency which I didnt typically like as much, but the complexity is definitely there, but the flavours arent the best in their large doses - however, Im sure this is highly rated due just the label on the front of the bottle. I sampled this 50 cL bottle purchased from Craft & Growler in Dallas, Texas on 01-September-2015 for US$9,79 sampled at home in Washington on 23-February-2017.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

3837,"2016-01-17",4.1,"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/18/2015. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, orange, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, mango, apricot, pear, apple, pepper, hay, straw, wheat, cracker, musty funk, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, mango, apricot, pear, apple, pepper, hay, straw, wheat, cracker, musty funk, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, mango, apricot, pear, apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from carbonation and yeast spice. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy brett saison style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV.

Had this a bunch of times now, its one of my favorite beers thats come out this year, but I never took notes on it till just the other day. 

The beer pours a very hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head and lots of lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is bright citrus at first but then follows with a bunch of wet limestone... lime zest, mild musty funkiness. Just all sorts of fruity, weird, inviting, bright yet dank... totally aromatic in a big way. 

The flavor is fruity, pineapple, lemon, orange, and some lime zest. Its got a great minerallity, its fairly dry but a good ways from anything Id call ""bone"" dry. Its got a mild but very well integrated bitterness throughout. Just lots of bright hops, a little floral character, a touch of light alcohol spiciness. Overall extraordinarily cohesive. 

The beer is prickly and dances on the tongue, the dryness and bitterness of the flavor add a lovely sensation when paired with this sort of carbonation.

Some pineapple, peach, grape, mango stuff knocking around from the brett, but its pretty mild. The beer has that dusty dry farmhouse aroma that crops up in a lot of brett beers. Taste is quite dry with some more pleasant fruit from the yeast, somewhat bland hop bitterness and a dusty, woody character. The finish is a bit bland. Gentle, full feel. Its light but soft. Its a nice enough experiment, but the Mikkeller yeast series showed off the yeast character a bit better. Strictly as a beer, its just a a sorta boring brett farmhouse ale.

3837,"2015-10-02",3.9,"This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a glossy to hazy glazed over looking bright yellow to burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Lacing speckled the glass nicely.
The smell started off with light citrus smacking some spicy peppercorn and then some sweet and bitter pine. Orange enters in as it warms. Bitter rind-like features blend to balance. Light ""brett""-like sour features blend to boot.
Moves toward a sweet lemon-esque aroma as it continues to warm.
The taste was moderately sweet allowing an ample amount of sour and a nice underscore of bitterness all developing together through lemon, orange and then leading into the spiciness of the peppercorn to balance. Theres a semi-sweet to slight sour citrus aftertaste.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a semi-nice sessionability about it. Since the ""sour"" level is fairly tame in this one, this could definitely be crushable on those hot days.
Overall, I liked it for me, though I didnt get the ""sea salt"" in it, this is a good saison, yeah, Id have it again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3837,"2015-09-05",4.7,"My Bottom Line:
This tantalizing Wild Ales pineapple and coconut pith nuances ride a dry and bubbly mouthfeel to delightfully unique moments that seem to juxtapose salty minerals, tropical fruit juiciness and that je-ne-sais-quoi character stemming from brettanomyces clausenii. Oh my.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A fluffy head of foam dwindles into the misty blond.
-The finish is easygoing with barely any acidity or bitterness.
-Strangely enough, this isnt intensely funky.
-Everything is perfectly balanced.
-There is no sign of alcohol here.
-Salt is intelligently used in this one; it is not promiment, yet you know it is responsible for some of this brews idiosyncracies. 
-Hill Farmstead lovers take notice. This is a masterpiece which is going to be right up your alley.

Aromas are funky and dry, a bit dank and earthy with horseblanket, cobwebs and a bit of pineapple goodness. Florals, a bit of citrus and floral elements, subtle tropical fruit grows slowly as the hops come into the fold more. Dry grain, straw, grapefruit rind is fruity, pulpy and pithy. Some wafts of tropical fruit. Alluring as it settles. Initial is lighter end of the fold, just a touch of bready girth. Pineapple and funk meet mellow bitterness, pithy citrus, firmer pineapple juice sweet and a bit tart with subtle tropical fruit. Mellow horseblanket, dry straw and a bit of cool smoothed out fruit. The bitterness picks up a touch into the backend, the funk works well as a middling yet sufficient tropical alllure, mango and faint bubblegum meet that tart pineapple, earth and bready malts. A bit dry, bitter and funky as we round the corner with smoothed out tropical elements from the middle rollingover. I dig this. The hop element adds complexity but isnt overwhelming. The funk is on point, earthy and dank without overwhelming either. The elements seem integrated well with nice tropical elements, tart and fruity, as the backend gets a bit dry and bitter as we finish up. Mellow grains, earth. This drinks really nice and I dig it.

3837,"2015-07-17",4.9,"Poured from the keg at ""Just Tapd"" in Warner-Robins, GA. This beer is a murky golden yellow/orange color with a small white head. The smell and flavor reminds me of pine, very unique and I enjoyed the first sip but after each following sip it got better and better! I love this beer, the ABV is well hidden and it has no after taste. I highly recommend this beer.","Douglasville, Georgia, USA","ordybill"

3837,"2015-07-13",4.1,"7/13/15. 500mL bottle from Five Points. Hazy golden yellow pour with a nice frothy off-white head, great lacing. Nice funky aroma, Brett, tropical fruits, mild hint at tartness, more fruits. Yum. Nice flavor, Brett, tropical fruits, a hint at Smarties (which I enjoy in my American sours - that sort of indescribable yet delicious mildly chalky sourness), mild doughiness, a touch of bitterness. Digging it!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3837,"2015-07-12",3.7,"Pours a hazy light golden with a small white head with good lacing. Aroma has some lemon grass and citrus along with a little apple, Brett funkiness and a whiff of sulfur. Taste has lemon grass and citrus also, as well as the Brett funk and earthiness. Can definitely pick up the salt in the finish and also some minerality and light pepper. Just the barest hint of cracker malt flavor. Finishes mostly dry. Light/medium body with somewhat high carbonation. Yeast and hop forward with the yeast flavors barely leading. Very good but hoped for more.","Missouri, USA","jeremyh70"
3837,"2015-07-12",3.8,"Straw yellow color, a haze, bubbly white head. Smells funky perm, farm house, horse blanket, citrus, lemon, orange rind. Taste is a spicy bubbly, citrusy hops, a little pine, funky Brett. Not as flavorful as hoped for but still solid.

Taste is very well balanced, slightly tart, with nice hop and funk flavors. Not overpoweringly hoppy or funky, but a very pleasant blend.

3837,"2015-07-06",3.8,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy golden with a steady white head, lots of sticky lace. Nose is funky and hoppy, lightly estery and light bitterness. Flavor is similar, kind of a bitter funky taste with a Belgian yeasty finish. Wish it was a little more funky and the hops were a tad brighter. With time, I expect this to get funkier but the hops will drop, obviously.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

3837,"2015-07-03",4.1,"Hazy light golden pour with a fluffy white head. Good looking pour. Aroma was straightforward saison with nice hints of lemon, stone fruits, dusty brett, earthy hops. Flavors were in line with citrus fruits, dry, dusty bitterness throughout, lingering fruity hops balanced nicely with the yeast. Slick mouthfeel with slightly prickly carbonation. The higher ABV in this one is literally no where to be found. Super refreshing hoppy saison. Awesome.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
