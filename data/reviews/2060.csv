I am not sure this was supposed to be so tart. Still not bad, but not like any biere de garde I can recall.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

>> There are probably many versions of this beer all collapsed into this entry given their rarity/rarity of ratebeerians in general. This version was 7.1%, 100% Mourvedre Barrel Aged. Low haze orange pour. Nose is excellent buttery oak barrel, fresh bourbon more than red wine. Taste is clean, mild alcohol stickiness, candied orange, oak, paper. Tannic, pepper finish. Interesting as always from Ladyface but with the characteristic harsh palate that seems to be a universal problem with their beers.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

A touch of oak, white wine, and lemon zest.  The flavor has a nice peach quality along with mild tartness of lemon.  Lots of straw, a moderate oak note along with some drying tannins.  A light malt flavor, mostly just bread.  The nose is a bit better than the flavor, but enjoyable.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2060,"2012-05-20",3.5,"Served on draft at local beer bar.  A cloudy look matches a somewhat thick palate.  Sour in taste, similar to same brewerys Trebuchet saison, but heavier on the mouth.

2060,"2010-09-20",3.6,"GABF 2010. Very good Biere de Garde. spice, pot pourri like purfuminess. Dash of sweet maltiness n this golden colored ale. Maybe a tad too sweet but still quite good in my book","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
2060,"2010-06-16",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2010 My Bottom Line:
This dignified Bière de Garde joins lightly toasted malts, spicy noble hops and bready yeast into an authentic example of the style one rarely sees so far from French shores.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the hazy amber. 
-The hop signature also offers citrusy angles, ending in mildly leafy bitterness.
-Subtle oranges add complexity. 
-This example is polished and rustic at once, a true testament to this brewers ability.

2060,"2010-06-13",3.7,"On tap at Ladyface. Pours with a large white head that leaves good lace over a hazed gold to copper body. Aroma is dry, grainy, tannic, dry wine, light pepper.

2060,"2010-06-08",3.8,"Oak aged version of the Tripel.  I liked this one much better - the wood dried out the syrupy sweetness and also calmed down some of the carbonation.  I actually enjoyed the dry hopped version even better that was also available when we were at the brewpub.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","can8ianben"
2060,"2010-06-06",4.0,"Draught at the restaurant watching the Tour de California.  Im not a big fan of Biere de Gardes but this was phenomenal; I think the wine barrels really made it special. It pours very still. A ruby-orange and brown colour with a small off-white head the quickly disappears/ The aroma is pink grapefruit, chardonnay and strawberries. Definitely fits the biere de garde style from the earthy, metallic notes (not bad, thats just my crutch for IDing the style). Definitely white wine notes that trend from a dry chardonnay to Mosel Rieslings. Lasting wine finish.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
