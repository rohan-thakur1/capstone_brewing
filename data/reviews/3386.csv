3386,"2017-01-28",4.1,"Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a dark amber color with a quickly dissipating thin fizzy white head. No lacing.
The aroma starts off with a thin white grape/vinous overlay to some dark fruits, currants. Sly amount of dark chocolate.
The flavor yields to the tartness first. And then sharpens against a nice vinous quality coming from a dry woody edge. Dark chocolate seems a bit more scaled back. Quick vinous sweet to dry dark fruity aftertaste. No finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with an appropriate carbonation to it, medium strength without letting acidity to get too tough on the feel.

3386,"2016-01-08",4.0,"375mL bottled 6/7/15, drunk 1/5/16, thanks to JoeT!Great appearance, with a deep auburn-mahogany colored body with great clarity and a light beige head atop that is small, but is surprisingly well-retained.Unfortunately, its quite boozey in the nose. Cant really get around it. It doesnt help the dry, bready, biscuity malts and light tannins, not to mention the currants and acidity from the bacteria. That being said, other than the heat, the nose is superbly balanced between yeast, wood, wine, fruit and malt. Plentiful black currant, black pepper, soft funk and light cherry-prune character to enjoy, with a good strength and a touch of almond and light brandy. Finally, with about 1/5 of the glass left, the alcohol burned off and what remained was truly divine. Guess I should have let it breath longer.In the mouth, the beer is less given to the alcohol, with tons of cherry, raisin, caramelized brown sugar and strong acidity to balance. Light balsam-like flavors, with a more dry wood character and piquant currant notes. Acetic character does not grow heavy and hangs in balance with the lactic acids. Wonderfully attenuated, though with enough body left to prevent any tannic astringency or overdose of acidity. Light grape, plum, brown sugar and black pepper linger on, with lip-smacking acidity. Tight carbonation. Seems like this stuff would age very well for a years to come.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Its just simply awesome.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"

It could age longer but is lovely now with no apparent signs of age. Feel is both citric and lively but dense and silken over a long finish.

3386,"2014-12-27",4.2,"Many thanks to Michael for the bottle.

Pours a fiery dark red color, with a fizzy, small head.

Smells of an intriguing tart funkiness, part barnyard, part sour, fermented fruit. Both smells blend very well together, supported by a pleasant, wooden malt note. The currants got a sweet, pungent hint to them, which enhances their sour aspect. The fruitiness turns even more present, while the brew warms up.

Begins with musty, wooden malts, joined by prickly currants, on which a dry, funky sourness settles, accompanying the fruity acidity. The barrel character provides wooden oak qualities, setting the balance of the beer. Then the sourness gets even dryer and more acidic, drying-out the tongue. Drinks dangerously easy, the alcohol is extremely well hidden. Finishes with matured, slightly wooden, leathery malts, with the addition of ripe grapes, while the tartness covers the outside of my teeth, leaving back a melange of joung currants and slick acidity.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Super tart and sour with nearly spritzy high carbonation. Heavy bodied and a big beer that can probably sneak up on you. Good stuff.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
3386,"2014-03-11",4.5,"Pours dark brown, almost purple with dissipating head. Nose is dark cherries and grapes, little winey. Taste follows nose with cherry, grape, currants, red wine sweetness, moderately sour, a touch of planty bitterness/dryness on the finish. Effervescent carbonation. Don't taste any of that 10%. Stellar sour.

10% ABV 

APPEARANCE: Gorgeous colors in this beer. Deep ruby mahogany, with a burnt orange rim variation. Little to no head with very light lacing. 

AROMA: Nice and sour fruit right away. The Cabernet barrel explodes with notes of oak, currants, black cherry jam some barnyard funk rounds it out. 

TASTE: Very tart lots of green apples which I didn't get on the nose. Fades rather quickly into the currant and cherries. Definitely getting that Cabernet flavors and nice oakiness. 

MOUTHFEEL: Oddly enough without having a head on the beer there is a lot of prickly carbonation. Medium bodied slight oily feel maybe due to the Cabernet barrels. 

OVERALL: Great, easily approachable sour. Wine drinkers will really appreciate the complex flavor profiles. Thoroughly enjoyed this, I think sharing the bottle was the way to go. The high ABV is hidden well and makes it almost to easy to drink. 

RATING: 4/5 Zombie Heads!

3386,"2013-10-04",4.2,"Batch 005X1E - 375mL bottle.
Aroma has a vinous dark fruit character with lots of cherries, berries and what I can only assume is what currants smell like. A hint of a leather note along with some light oak notes. Moderate acidity and a hint of alcohol. 
Pours an amber brown with some ruby notes. Thin tan head that recedes very quickly leaving a slight film on the edges. 
Flavor is rather tart upfront with a moderately strong dark fruit character similar to the aroma. Medium light oak character with a hint of tobacco. Slightly vinous with low bitterness and moderate acidity. Light alcohol note in the finish with some lingering dark fruit notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to almost no carbonation; the cork was starting to dry out and it only slightly hissed when popped. Light astringency with medium low alcohol warmth.
Overall I really enjoy this beer and I think the age has added a nice touch of complexity to it. Lots of people say this beer doesnt hold up as well as the others to the age, but I think it did better than the Supplication.

3386,"2013-06-09",4.8,"I got a bottle of this as a special from Yeasty Beasty.  What a great treat!  It pours a beautiful, dark, ruby color with a small head.  The aroma is of dark fruit, which makes perfect sense, being as it contains currants and is aged in wine barrels!  The taste is almost sweet up front, with a tart to sour finish, without the sourness being overpowering.  Dark fruit and a vinous quality make this a complex and enjoyable beer that should be sipped slowly and savored.  It would probably pair quite well with slices of a sour baguette or some bruschetta topped with smoked salmon or shellfish.","","eljefebrewing"

A - Pours a dark ruby brown color with an off-white head.

S - Red wine comes out strong along with lots of clean wood. Dried cherries, musty old church-like funk.

T - Sweet/sour cherries, tart raspberry quickly overtakes any sweetness with a lactic acidic bite. Malty sweetness barely bleeds through with notes of faint cocoa. The finish is a sensation of having plum/grape skins on your tongue along with a sharp punch of acidic sour right at the end.

M - Low prickly carbonation, thin body.

Wine and wood are strong components. Sharp and sour with lots of tart fruit character and was nice to have some good funk in there as well.

This would go great with grilled goat cheese filled mushrooms.

3386,"2013-01-01",3.9,"375ml bottle. Excited to try this! Pours out a clear reddish brown with a head that vanishes abruptly. The red wine barrels give this a really pleasant aroma along with those familiar vinegar notes that let you know that this will be sour! On the tongue the fruitiness of the barrel plays of well against the dark malt and gets close to the tobacco character described on the label. I had a harder time trying to identify the currants, which seem to be integrated more subtly. Not quite as sour as I imagined but nicely so. Maybe a slight let down from my expectations but still makes me wish I had access to all of their beers.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"

First beer of what promises to be a very good day.  Friends havent shown up yet, so I get this one almost all to myself.

A: Pours a dark ruby color with a light tan head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to a thin ring. Not much lace is left.

S: Big sweet currents with mildly tart undertones. Some lighter malts are present with a nice cab body showing itself on the finish of each sniff. Pretty earthy and bold, yet restrained enough to let the beer show.

T: Much more sour than the nose would suggest. There is some lactic sourness with a tart current body. The cab gives some dirty grape punch to cut through the sourness. Just a little bit of earthy and leathery malt to counter balance the tartness as well. As it warms a little more of the barrel comes out with some dry oakiness and light sweetness. The booze is so well hidden. I would have guessed, 6% or 7%.

M: Medium bodied with a nice prickly carbonation. There is a little more body to this beer, but it doesnt take away from the drinkability. The finish is slightly drying.

O: The Cab didnt overtake the base beer which is awesome. It gave it just enough earthy undertones to provide some more depths of flavor. This is right up there with Supplication as my favorite RR sour. The booze is extremely well hidden as well. Well put together.

3386,"2012-09-17",4.3,"1/3/2010 - For my 600th review I chose something special. When I first started drinking craft beers, my stash was marked by an imposed egalitarianism. No beer was above another, and no beer enjoyed a privileged spot. They were a council, electing members to cast their vote on my palate and to be judged. One day I was given a reason to break tradition. I was given a bottle of the Russian River Consecration. A very good (and considerate, and well compensated) friend purchased this beer for me on my birthday. When I took it home I put it on a pedestal, and vowed that it would appear in a very important beer rotation; it could only be had on some kind of special event. It seemed almost as if rather the beer marking the event, the event marked the beer. So, Happy New Years to me, and a warm welcome to 2010, but an even happier welcome to Consecreation, exiting the bottle and entering the world. This beer also augured the near future. It was originally made as a relative of the 20th anniversary brew for Torinado, the famous taphouse in San Diego, and my future home for 5 years as an aspiring Ph.D. student. This beer holds a special place in my review archive, and deserves special attention in both the tasting and the tasting notes. I hush the room, and pour the beer, where the ruby red and almost black body climbs up the glass, eventually unfurling a light tan head. A robust but controlled aroma of sour cherry and roasted cherry tobacco emanates from the nose. Its a nice sour - natural, unique, pleasing - and hints at the chardonnay barrels so proudly employed by the brewers, but like many sour ales, it is a singular aroma. Sourness and acidity are ramped up in the flavor, supplemented by some alcoholic burn. In just one sip it tastes like a barrel of juicy Bing cherries touched by the patient effect of oak aging. Its a sour brew for sure, and I find my eyes watering here and there, but its well worth the torture. As it warms, the Consecreation rolls in some flavors of fine olive oils, introducing low, rolling and smooth grassy and olive notes, which add a third dimension of flavor to a sourness that threatens to wrest control from all the other flavors. Sour beers are not always known for the ornateness or filigree of their flavor profiles, but the flavors they do exhibit need to be keenly profound. The Russian River Consecration does not fail to miss the mark, setting high expectations for my future sour ales, and beginning the New Year with a high mark. (Little did I know how formative 2010 would be. The Consecration obviously did its work.)","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3386,"2012-09-16",4.6,"Bottle. The pour was a clear deep dark mahogany brown with a small (less than 1 finger) white fizzy head that dissipated in 1-2 seconds and basically had no lacing to speak of.

The aroma was very complex and enticing with a dark grain malt and funky Brett yeast and possessed notes of dark fruit (red grape and black currant), a bit of oak cask and a boldly tart red wine presence.

The taste was sweetly tart and a tad acidic and had strong currant and grape notes throughout, with the finish having a bold and somewhat dry sour wine alcohol taste. The flavor lingered on the taste buds for a bit more than an average duration following the swallow, with a really wonderful sour fruity taste lasting quite a bit longer.

Mouthfeel was right below medium in body with a really smooth dry texture and an almost champagne like carbonation.

Overall I can not express how much I enjoyed this particular brew, it was sweet and fruity yet bold and sour with a fantastic lingering lip smackin taste.

Sizzling tan head disappears immediately and leaves a headless more amber than ruby colored beer.
Smell black currants, barleys, yeast, wood/oak, wild yeast, some dark fruity sweetness.
Taste sour darker fruit, sour yeat, sour oak and wood, sour malts tend to go nasty but seems to be stopped due to the sour grade.
Some yoghurt sour, darker fruits, dry, vinous, barleys, barley malted sweetness with a dark druit sweetness that is taken over bu the sour part
Starts with a nice sour dark fruity mix ten goes dry and sour and tends to go nasty sour malty.
Aftertaste is a mix of sour grapes and sour cherries, a nice warm dryness with yeast/wild yeast and malty oak tones.
The aftertaste tends to go to nasty bitter but gets taken over pretty quick, by a more or less one dimensional sour tartness.
Medium to fuller carbo, tingly sparkling spicy mouthfeel, full body and a light creamy texture.
Easy drinkable, considering the alcohol percentage.

Purchased at the brewery in Fall, 2009 and consumed while playing original Nintendo on July 12, 2010. Decadence.

A: A thin and flat appearance, ruby-tinged brown hued with very little head and virtually no retention or lacing. Upon the second pour, the head is very fizzy and fades almost instantly with a hissing sound.

S: Cherries, oud bruin, wild yeast, wood. This beer smells very complex.

T: A lot of flavors going on here. Everything I named in the aroma, plus a funky tartness that makes my lips pucker and my throat tingle. Really profound and complex, this beer is very intriguing and enjoyable. Many sours in the 10% or above abv range are considerably harsher than this.

M: Acetic, vinegar finish that grows stronger over time. Puckering finish that makes the cheeks (on your face) pucker and cringe (in a good way).

D: Im taking on the whole 750mL tonight, but this is certainly a good candidate for splitting amongst a few friends.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Perfectly blended now. Very complex barrel notes. Not tasting the red currant as much as in a fresh draft. Bottle version is still definitely sour, but the finish is wonderfully smooth.

I just got done drinking a Lost Abbey Red Poppy before this and wondering if it tainted the flavors, because it tasted very similar, just better in balance. The fruit flavors from the cabernet barrels were definitely noticed and the oak was not overwhelming. There was not much sour to it though, which I was kind of bummed about.

The aromatic expectations leadme to believe that this is going to be a very tart beer.  Ok, here is the first sip:  we are dealing here with an almost lambic level sourness here, with almost no residual sugar.  This is fantastic news because I hate beers with a sweet finish.  Upfront you are getting a smack of tartness, followed by a clobbering of wood.  Oak, sour fruit and whispers from the dark unknown dominate the profile here.

3386,"2012-03-01",3.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/22/2011.  Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a pint glass.

Consecration pours a dark brown color with a hint of ruby at the edges. No carbonation apparent from no head - uh oh. 

Black currants, vinegar, with a nice oak barrel character create an acetic aspect to the nose. An obvious tart character accompanies a light raisin aroma. 

The flavor is dominated by sweet balsamic vinegar, black currants, and a rich oaky bite . Some dark fruit flavor complement. The finish is quite tart. 

For a sour, this is full bodied. Tart and puckering, with a little bit of residue on the tongue. Pretty flat, maybe I got a leaky bottle?

Appearance: Beautiful shade of hazy ruby red/mahogany. Forms a tiny head which fizzles away like a soda. 

Smell: Distinct sour red grape with a lot of vinous overtones. Strong vanilla/wood aroma imparts rustic earthiness.

Taste: You know a beer is going to be great when, upon your first sip, you cant think straight afterwards because youve just experienced so many different flavors at once! Thats what happened to me just a few seconds into Russian River Consecration. Wow! Where to begin? Its like a Belgian quad thats been soured and wood-aged with some roasted malts added and gone flat. Ill break it down:

It begins with immediate sourness - the tasty kind you find in beers like this brewed with wild ales. Next comes dark, tart, acidic fruits like cherry, black cherry, currants, blackberries, and sour red grapes. Its similar to sangria, but with an overt sourness to it. After all that comes the barrel-aged portion with strong vanilla and wood flavors - akin to a clean rum. I even detect a brief, subtle flavor of chocolate or dark roasted malts, although I doubt theres any used in the brewing of the beer. It comes full circle back to the sourness, only stronger and drier, with a surprisingly clean aftertaste. Its delicious and I want more!

Mouthfeel: Thin, tepid, slight warming sensation and accompanying taste of alcohol. 

Drinkability: Russian River Consecration is an expensive beer, which is a shame because its so easy to drink and such a delight for the palate that you wish one bottle didnt cost the same as a 12-pack of most supermarket beers. The palate is strong as hell, no denying it, but the drinking process is amazingly easy. It goes down like water, and its even refreshing for a moment with no cloying after effects. An amazing beer on so many levels.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The beer might be better thought, no offense Fred. :) The beer is a dark brown with a hint of red burnt into the color. The aroma is nice but doesnt do the beer justice. Perhaps this is because the beer was a little too cold. However, the smell doesnt seem to possibly indicate the wonderful flavor the beer has. The sour is obvious, with a nice funk and strong bite. However, the currants seem to really balance the beer in a nice way. The beer tastes dark with a champaign bubbly mouth feel sweet and sour flavor that really is great! Nice job Russian River!

A - Pours deep amber with a thin film of white head that leaves minimal lacing down the glass.

S - Strong tartness up front, strongest of the three. Hints of spices, berries, and oak. Aromas dont linger for long but they leave a lasting impression.

T - Not the first time I have had this one. Starts with a bit of spice from the currents quickly giving way to a blast of strong tartness. Finish is a lingering funk with a bright acidic note. I prefer the other two, supplication and temptation, but I still like this one a lot. Still one of my favorite wilds.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tart finish lingers but not for too long. It wears you down after a full glass.

D - Fairly high. I really like this one but when you put all three of these together you really see how different they really are.

A nice introduction to both Id say..

Batch001X4 - 750ml Caged and Corked.

A -Dark and Deep Red, Almost brown and fairly opaque. Very little head if any.

S - Lots of sourness, dark and sweet candy. I pick up some new fruit and slight oak as well.

T - Just amazing. I not completely versed in how these tend to age but I find the sourness fades a bit and the fruit becomes more evident. The currants, fig, and candy notes were outstanding and really stood up the brett/lacto nicely. The oak tends to develop nicely and become more prevalent with aging. It was only a bit but I felt like the oak was there on the finish. I was surprised it had any left but the carbonation was perfect.

M - Perfect. The carbonation wasnt low but just the way I prefer for this style.

What a great vintage and an even better way to share with friends. Thanks techster82

I will agree that this is a very refreshing brew. Actually, it is shockingly tasty and say to drink at 10% ABV. The sourness is just right - no puckering yet addictively sweet and sour. It does have the cherry and cranberry fruit taste yet has notes of grape-like wine flavor and a vinegar tinge. Carbonation is high and part of what makes it very refreshing.

Anyway, it pours a reddish brown with a evanescent head that leaves but a speck of lacing. So what is in the aroma? Some wood, a little bit of wine, tart sour cherries, not the slightest hint of booze, some other ambiguous fruit aromas (currants perhaps...). So yeah, all good stuff. The taste goes through a series of stages (as a complex beer should one would think). At first, my mouth was not sure what was really going on, but then the sour started hitting and escalated. It enveloped the tongue brought out a little bit of astringency. This is not an extremely sour beer, although it is plenty sour (not that this has any impact on enjoyability). However, it is more complex than most other sour ales that I have had and it is also certainly of a higher abv. The mouthfeel, which I find to be one of the primary appeals of sours, is wonderful.

Batch 001 - Beer is brown and clear, there is no head and only slight carbonation. The aroma is a mixture of sweet and sour (but not of the Chinese food variety). Really great sour / tart flavor with a hint of malt in there, really shocking. Beer finishes slightly dry overall. There is also a hint of oak and funk at the end, very slight.

Batch 002 - Again, it is clear and brown but this time the carbonation a lot higher. Large bubbles rise through the beer quickly, still no head. The aroma is slightly sweeter but is still very sour. The beer has the same sour notes at the batch 001, in fact they are pretty much the exact same flavor but this one has a slight bitterness to it. I think the bitterness helps accent the oak flavors in the back.

Batch 003 - This one appears slightly lighter than the other two, but just slightly. Still brown and clear. Not as bitter as the Batch 002 but just as sour. Some oak notes in the back.

Overall this is a top notch sour, one of my favorites by a lot. All three were great and I would have them again.

A: Pours a rich dark brown similar to a dark scotch or whisky with no head whatsoever. Lacing is lean if at all. Reminds me of a glass filled with a spirit.

S: Intense tart and sour notes. Currents are dominate for main flavor but oak is present as well. Touch of sweetness similar to vanilla pop up here and there but overall this is a very sour beer.

T: Clean and balanced but still quite tart and sour. Big sour and tart notes hit the palate up front with current as the fruit. Current is very dominate but the entire flavor is clean and balanced with just a touch of oak and wood.

M: Full bodied and clings to the palate, front to back, from start to finish. There is zero carbonation, the bite from this beer comes from the sour affects of yeast and barrel aging.

D: This is an amazing sour. The barrel aging in Cabernet barrels with currents truly gives you a puckering affect thats sour and tart from start to finish. This isnt over done on sour instead is incredibly balanced for how intense and big this beer is.","centennial, Colorado, USA","noturdadsbeer"

It pours with a super fizzy head that dissipates within a second and leaves no lacing. The beer is a hazy reddish plumb color with hints of brown.

It has a pungent smell. There is some red wine smell along with a huge whiff of oak. There is also some sour currant and caramel. It is very sour and oaky smelling.

The taste is very reminiscent to a dark red wine. It is very vinous and tannic. The oak is milder in the flavor than it was in the smell. There is a slight funk note but the yeast is mostly sour. Not asspuckeringly sour but pretty nicely sour. Underneath everything there are traces of malts including the smallest hint of toastiness. It finishes with a dry grapeskin/seed flavor. As you go the subtly sweet currant flavor can be tasted in the back of the mouth along with some oxidized apple. 

The mouthfeel is pretty good for a sour. It is a tad thin but very dry and tannic in the finish. The alcohol surprisingly isnt totally hidden under the deep complexity though it never becomes overbearing.

Overall this is a nice sour. It is definitely one of the sourest beers I have had yet.

I have been saving it for a big rating (1200!) and at $17 for a 375 ml bottle, it better be good.  The appearance is pretty average, but it is super interesting on the nose - aromas of fruit, cider, malt, oak, and some flowers.  The taste is very sour and oaky, and there seem to be wine tannins in there too.  Nice impact on the palate - numbing and sour.  You could easily fool someone into thinking that this was a random wine.  It makes me think more of a shiraz wine than a beer, and sure enough, a close look at the label reveals that is has been aged in cabernet sauvignon barrels - that explains a thing or two. 

It is interesting for sure, but it didnt really win me over.  The tarry wine residue clashes a little with the sour cherry flavor of the ale.  Consecration costs as much as good wine, and given that it tastes so much like wine, I would rather have a glass of good vino.  The alcohol content is similar too. And something is not right here - no wine connoisseur would drink a wine that has been aged in beer barrels.  So why are we beer geeks drinking beer that has left to sit in old wine casks?  Maybe I am being unfair.  I have not had a lot of the sour ales out there, not yet anyway, but I will give Russian River this - Consecration is not like anything else I have had yet.  This may end up with a good rating after all, but it is not going to the top of my charts. I dont think I will seek it out again. Interesting brew, but overpriced and overrated.","USA","Slipstream"

3386,"2011-01-30",4.6,"From notes:

Pours a deep ruby color with golden mahogany edges and a two finger frothy off-white head. Good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting ring that coats the glass with large chunks of soapy lacing.

Funky, musty aroma with lots of earthy oak tannis, dry brett and vinous dark fruit. The barrel aging is very prominent in the nose with lots of red wine character. Hints of grape, currant, tart cherries and other dark berries as well as oak and subtle vanilla. This is complimented by the funky/barnyard/horsey notes.

Full bodied, intensely tart and puckering with slight acidity and some soft carbonation up front. Very funky with lots of musty, dry brett/bugs as well as a sour vinegar flavor that lingers over the barrel and vinous dark fruit notes into puckering dry finish that leaves me drooling for more. As in the aroma, the barrel character is prominent with earthy oak, slight vanilla and a prominent red wine/dark fruit flavor. Hints of grape, currant cherry, plum, raisin and other dark berries.

This beer has an incredible balance of tart, acidic, funky sourness and sweet, vinous dark fruit and it is the perfect blend of the wine and craft beer worlds.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

3386,"2011-01-24",4.5,"Draft at Monks for Russian River Day. Pours deep, dark, mahogany silky brown with a calm, smooth surface. No head. Aroma is subtle, but nice; sour cherries, tart fig, grapes, red wine, slight vinegar barley, hints of vanilla, oak, and sweet malts.

3386,"2011-01-18",3.7,"After an unreasonably arduous brewday, I need something good to relax me and the funk was calling me. Poured into a tulip. Batch 003x4.

Cork pull gave a spirited pop, but then the beer inside got pissy and decided to spill out a bit over the top. Not really overcarbonated, but given the day I just had, Im not surprised that this beer was out to get me. Anyway...

4.0 A: Dark mahogany color and hazy. Looks like I might have gotten the yeast in an uproar. Two fingers of fizzy off white head that acts and falls like the head on a can of Coke.

4.0 S: Nose is pleasant, but pretty simplistic for a sour. On the acid front, the only thing that comes through with any power is acetic acid, which could be amplified by the currants. Latic acid is soft if it is even there at all. I can smell the barrel, but wouldnt have any idea that it was Savignon if I didnt read the label. Black currant and cherry fruitiness underlying.

4.0 T: Quite a lot more going on in the taste than in the nose. The first thing that struck me was a tongue paralyzing astringency, but this dies down upon additional sips. Very musky as well. The Cabernet makes an big appearance in the taste and actually this tastes more like a soured wine than a soured beer. Though there is a touch of vinegary-ness, there is a lot more lactic acid, though surprisingly not too tart. Tannins with currant and raisin fruitiness. Though I appreciate complexity, the big bold flavors are each too aggressive on their own and fail to mesh harmoniously.

3.5 M: Lighter medium. Good moderate amount of fizzy carbonation. Astrigency on finish that lingers. Alcohol is noticeable, but seems more like 7% than 10%.

3.5 D: Not bad, but seems like there are too many flavors competing without any direction.

Wonderfully complex bouquet with oaked cabernet tones and light fruitiness amidst the sweet tart pungence. No detectable vanillins.

Easy sour tart body. Much more subdued than other sour beers and with the appealing complexity-adding nuances of oak, cabernet, and delicate, well-blended fruitness. Horse-hair and barny sour touch on the finish--but all in proper balance.

This ruby colored brew had an aroma near perfection. tart fruit, with perfectly balanced sweetness. Comparable only to Liefmans Goudeband, but better in every aspect than any other RR sour, including the $25 Beatification I had a few weeks ago. The flavor was less sour than La Folie, Rodenbach, or other RR sours, but was definitely enought to stand up and take notice. Sour cherry, deep dark fruits. Great body too. They couldnt tell me why the goblets were $6 but the 750 bottles were $25!! Come on...more than twice as much per ounce in a bottle? Isnt it usually the other way around?

The oak has a lasting but not overpowering flavor that lightly coats the tongue, while the cabernet, currants, tart, and slight tannin tastes play.  The dryness of the beer help all of these elements to pop on the palate and make me a happy man.  I cant wait until my next bottle.","Palm Desert, California, USA","BeerMePodcast"

Aroma is full of strawberry and sour cherry complemented by subtle notes of brown sugar and prunes. Flavor is first and foremost delightfully tart fruit (strawberry, lemon, sour cherry), followed by sweet caramel, dark fruit, oak, and dry hoppiness. The tartness definitely lingers but ultimately takes a backseat to dry bitter hops, oak, and prune juice. Heavy on the carbonation; prickly mouthfeel.

But after a while the wood seems to come and i pick up butter scotch and a little vanilla. Mmm great stuff. Flavour wise it basically is all just about the sourness. Light blasamic I guess.Still it is not over poweringly tart. Struggle to pick up much else but brilliant all the same. Finish is very dry thanks to the acidity and also the lively mouthfeel.

The flavor is of sour apple, grapes, very subtle alcohol, and citrus. It has a light feel on the palate with high carbonation.

Pours a strikingly clear browned ruby red, with a nice tanned slick head. It has really incredible flavor complexity thats inline with good red wines, a touch of spicy, dry leather, some fig-like dark fruits, and smooth-well-integrated alcohols. This is so graceful. Even the sourness is gentle, soft, elegant and complexit, with piquant sharpness that adds fun to the beer, but doesnt get overly harsh or brash. It elicits a thought of tart, acidic port, without the sugary heaviness and with the complexity and the rich fruit-flavored profile. Amazingly delicious. 9/5/9/5/18


330mL Bottle. Batch 004x2. Either my tastes have really change, or this beer thas become a lot more uninteresting. I do remember being really enamored with the vinous complexity of this beer, but now it just seems like a singular white grapefruit juice bomb with some dried currants added. Warmer and with more tobacco. Its good, up there with a number of Russian River sours, but its not mind boggling.

Guess its a sign that I should rate this.  Ive had it on tap a couple times, but this rating is based on a 375 ml bottle (batch #4) from Holiday Wine Cellar ($11.99).  Pours a lovely deep red, almost brown.  Obviously, the carbonation is downright explosive but escapes so quickly as to not really leave a head -- actually, its almost like cola.  Aroma is complex and lovely with notes of fine wine, fruit (cherry and grape), wood, funk, and vinegar.  Flavor is similarly complex with many of the same elements: rich dry red wine, grape, wood, vinegar.  Its certainly sour, but not in an inaccessibly astringent kind of way.  The flavor is also not as funky as I might have thought considering that the bottle indicates four different strains of bacteria.  Quite dry finish which must be derived from the tannins in the barrel.  Really good stuff and this transcends what ""beer"" is and can be.  Of course, it possibly would have been better if the bottle had been chilled before the top shot off!  (530. 339)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

3386,"2010-06-19",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2014 batch 002X2  This bad boy was a gusher.  This reddish brown sour patch kid is definitely an acquired taste.  A huge mouth puckering sour taste overrun with tart fruit, cherry, currant, vinegar, and cheap cabernet sauvignon.  It finishes off with a little burn.  Might be best out of one of those titty sip cups with the nipple drink hole.  Its is Rodenbach done Cali style.  It does get a little better with each sip...
Just tried batch four which deserves a re-rating.  Not nearly as sour, with big black currant flavors.  Wow, what a difference.....

3386,"2010-06-19",4.1,"Bottle. Batch 001x3.

Reddish brown with a medium-sized tanned/off-white head that leaves a lot of lacings. 

The aroma is malty with a noticeable funky and lactic character. Notes of wet wood, mud, grass and tart fruit. A herbal note as well, perhaps anise. 

The flavor is full with a nice malty foundation and tart fruit notes. Lovely tart currant flavors coupled with grass. Overall, the flavor development is really pleasant and integrated. The finish is very very dry considering the ABV, and has a light bitterness to it beneath a sour fruitiness. 

Full-bodied and smooth with a semi-sticky mouthfeel.

Winey, vinegary, sourish nose.  Reminscent of Rodenchbach.  Taste: HOLY SNIKES!  Explosively huge flavors of oak, cherry, vanilla, vinegar.  Eye-wateringly sour, yet remarkably delicious.  This beer has twice the flavor of Rodenbach, itself a magnificent beer that overwhelms most of the uninitiated.  Lingering, strong aftertaste.  Had to immediately order another glass.

Appearance: Nicy ruby to garnet body with a lovely silky frothy light mocha crown that pours large. Lots of retention and lacing with a silky slightly oily sheen!

Smell: This is one of the most intoxicating olfactory pleasures Ive ever had. Im really having a strong positive reaction to the nose. Nice amount of barnyard plus additional aromatics from the wild yeast come together with currants and other dark fruits. Nice oak notes dominate and create a wonderful musk. Leather and a light cigar note really round it out. Highbrow all the way.

Taste: First of the sourness is so well crafted. I cant believe Im about to describe ""sourness"" as ""velvety"" but that is what I just did. The sourness is velvety smooth and lush. Im getting a lemon/grape citric type note but I think that is coming from the wine barrel usage. The black currant mixes well and I feel like Im getting other notes of black cherry.

Mouthfeel: Very lush and extremely carbonated.

Drinkability: I think this one will give me heartburn by the time Im done but its damn tasty so its going down fast. :)

3386,"2010-05-22",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2010 My Bottom Line:
This accomplished Sour Ale astonishes through its suave complexities, with flavors ranging from coniferous brettanomyces, black currants, red wine, lemons, raisins and balsamic vinegar. This one has many things to say, and all of its ideas are harmonious.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the reddish marroon.
-The black currant fruitiness and well developed chocolatey malts are a wonderful match.
-The finish is an agile blend of sourness, dry brett wilderness and lingering juicy fruit.
-The mouthfeel is lush and effervescent. Its hard to believe this is 10% abv.

Very sour flavor of dark berries, apple, and lemon and this time the cider vinegar does make its way through along with a hint of oak.  The alcohol is almost invisible in this beer totally masked by the sourness.  No doubt this is a sour beer but the flavors are well-balanced with nothing too funky that gets in the way.

A-Body is a very hazy translucent medium mahogany hue. Pours with an approximately 1 finger foamy off-white head but this quickly fades pretty quickly leaving only a thin collar.

S-Nose has a very pungent acidic tartness from and is all that I noticed initially. With a deeper look aromas of oak, cigars, red wine, and cherry pits are also noted.

T- Much like the nose the flavor initially is dominated by a sharp acidic sourness all the way through with a very clean finish. With a deeper look and as one becomes more accustomed to the sourness the oak barrel flavor comes through as well as red wine and tobacco-more so with the finish than initially. Its interesting because the more you sip the more complex the beer becomes and the more you notice. The slightest alcohol

P- Exceptionally smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. Body is thick, velvety smooth, and rich.

O- Wow. This is another excellent sour from the folks at Russian River. Delicious, rich, and complex. This beer has aged very well so far and is certainly a slow sipper.

3386,"2010-03-30",4.1,"On draft at Russian River Brewing (Santa Rosa, CA): Pours a glowing, translucent mahogany red and topped with a thin white halo around the edges. This appearance alone is enticing enough. Vinious on the nose- aromatic notes of black currants, cherries, tart blackberries, kiwi, dark pitted fruits past prime, chocolate, earth, and a hint of damp basement. Flavors are similar with added chardonnay, wood, and various funk. Mouthfeel is quite heavy, dominant on the tart side. A massively drying finish.

I cannot see visible carbonation, though the mouthfeel is lively and tingly somehow.  The aroma is spot on for the style. True, genuine sour ale qualities of vinegar, oak, horses, overripe fruits and vinous tones make for an enjoyable and balanced bouquet. The flavor is much of the same. Lots of sour funk up front, though without being aggressive, with an endlessly complex body of grape, cherry, oak, vanilla, grass. The most notable flavors are of balsamic vinegarette, farmland and wool. Quite an offering from the masters at Russian River.

In the mouth it has almost champagne like presence, but with bracing bitterness help up by a second wave of sweeter currant and cherry. The funk is all over this and was different in three different glasses. Complex but definetely a beer geeks beer. Would like a bit more body to it too, but really easy drinking for 10%.

The aroma was by far the best sour I have smelled in a while there were currants, chocolate covered cherries and funk. This is one complex brew. it had a light carbonation but If I was to hand it to some of my European relatives the would immediately think this was some sort of carbonated red wine. It was fruity and slightly tart to the taste. This is a great wild one of the best I have had.

The flavor is very full and complex.  PLenty of dark fruity with a full funky finish.  The carbonation is a really big flaw in this one though.  It is very carbonated, which I can understand is arguably to style (for some lambics) but the carbonation bubbles are very big and fizzy, like in a soda.  If it had nice fine bubbles it might work to compliment the beer, but my friend and I both agree that the huge carbonation sort of clears the flavor from our palates.  It weird.    Great ruby red color-- clear but dark.  The head is just fizzy and weak and disappears almost instantly.    Overall: a damn good beer worthy of its hype.

Batch 002X1


Aroma: The nose of this one is strongly reminiscent of the carbernet barrels that it is aged in (wine and oak).  Its got tart fruit, some wood, grapes, apples, cherry, booze, some funk, and maybe a bit of tobacco.  

Appearance: This one pours a cloudy and dark burgundy color with a lasting light brown head.

Flavor: It has quite an interesting flavor with a distinct fruity sweetness followed by just the right amount of funk in the finish.  All those components of the nose combine, and the result is a good balance of the sweet and sour.

Palate: This beer has a really nice mouthfeel thats both fizzy and smooth, a medium body, and the ABV is so well-hidden that this one could really cause some problems.

Overall Impression: 
Another nice one from Nick!  You West Coast guys are spoiled by being able to get Russian River stuff so easily.  I wish I could walk into my local liquor store and pick up bottles of their beers anytime I wanted.  Anyway, this beer was obviously quite good.  I can tell by how much Im writing about this beer, that I must really be enjoying it.

The body has a very dark clean almost totally opaque crimson body.  The initial flavor is full of tart acidic cherry, pear, some yeasty undertones and a very subtle alcohol.  The irony about the flavor is the fact that it is has a communion wine feel about itself.  Its flavor really take off as it warms.  Taking on a very heavy dose of tart and sour fruit, both cherry and pear.  This is a very tasty, easily drinkable brew, with a comparison to a quality sherry.

original rating.  Beergod #630.  I was aiming for getting to rating 1000 on new years eve, but I got there a day early. Who gives a shit anyways. This beer only seems appropriate as I get consecrated into BeerGoddum.   The goddam Cork came out with a nice pop. A steady pour down the middle of my star glass yields a clear dark copper hue with bright ruby red highlights and a sizeable frothy tan head.  


Aroma is a nice flowing river of tangy plum, raisins, melted caramel, and chocolate covered cherry notes.  As it warms, this bad boy smells like dark chocolate filled with tart cherries with a hint of booze and dates. I liked this more and more as time went on, but I was also smoking a far amount of hop like substance at the time-  tricky to decompose the two effects. 


ANYWAYS, Flavor has a sour cranberry wine juice like base with a layer of cocoa and medicine. Pretty damn good stuff.  Very clean and distinct aroma and flavor.  sharp.


 Complaints?  I dont know.  Does sour chocolate cherry wine taste similar to sour cherry cough medicine? Because I couldnt get medicine out of my head at times with this beer.  Regardless, this beer was quite good.  A sour dark fruit wine mix with some chocolate and medicine popping in is the best way I can describe it.

The beer reminds me enormously of Rodenbach Grand Cru, almost certainly not because of the bacteria in the California oak barrels, probably because of the yeast and the current juice.

Damn this beer is a gift from God himself. Nice subtle tartness throughout. Makes a bold sour apple flavor. Slight vinegar to get it a very distinct tart/sour backing. Damn this thing is delicious.

3386,"2009-12-18",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2009 Ok, not my normal ""go-to"", but a darn fine nightcap.  This one has been aging for over a year.  It pours spot-on for a cola, with an initial fizzy brown head that quickly reduces to nothing.  The color is of deep ruby, differentiating it ONLY from the pour of a Coca-Cola product to the eye.  The nose is of deep warehouse-stored Bazooka bubble gum, aerated sugars, currants and sour dark cherries.  The sour cherries shine forth in the flavor, accompanied by a traditional Flemish accent of white wine vinegar.  Sours truly dominate this, but are integrated very well into the overall pull.  The finish is a curt Chardonnay fruity close, with a breathy aftereffect of a tannin-laden Cabernet.  The mouthfeel is lively and perky, with subtle soda-grade carbonation.  The body is full of fruity complexities, and will leave any Sour Ale fan (especially Flemish) in wanting.  As the initial 6-month aging begins at the brewery, in Cab-Sav oak containers, I can definitely see the hues of aged Cabernet Sauvignon storage containers, and think that as the brew warms, it only stands to enhance the complex palate.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

Im really digging all the dry berry notes in this beer. Not enough to make it overly fruity, but enough to give it tremendous depth.

The aroma has lots of red wine traits, some oak, berries (currants?) and dark malt lingering in the back.  It has a medium clean crisp body with a low amount of carbonation & that works very well for the beer.  The flavor starts with the aroma traits with a heavy emphasis on the wine tastes, but there is s spiciness, and some taking off the bite.  This seems more sour / tart in a wine way than most sour ales.  The finish is clean, tart and has some warming alcohol.

Surprisingly did not take much away from this amazing beer -previously had it on tap and fell in love.  Pours a beautiful reddish dark brown with thin off white head, the color of an aged port.  Aroma is oak wine barrel, sour dark cherries, yeast,  a mix of champagne and heavily oaked red wine.  Taste is for a split second sweet fruit but then switches to an amazing tartness - sour grapes, red wine, dark cherries, oak in the background.

Taste is mouth-puckering sour cherries, sherry, a bit of vinegar, warhead sour candies, a bit of warming alcohol towards the end.

The oak is much more assertive, almost dominant, on the tongue;  definite currant presence in the middle after which the lacto and pedio make their presence known.

Thanks to a generous trader for sending me a bottle of this a few months ago.  For Rating #1200 it seemed like a slam dunk so I fished it out of the cellar and let it chill for about an hour.  My reward was one of the best sours I have tried - there are a few lambics which are better but this is not one to complain about.

Aroma / Appearance - Reddish black and opaque with a short lived head there was still plenty of carbonation.  Citric acid, black cherries, and oak form a crisp sourness about on par with a mellow Cantillon.  It smells almost like a cola which has been spiked with brett and lacto.

Flavor / Palate - Tart hayseed, flat cola, and raspberries rinse the tongue before drying out the throat.  Medium grade as I expected this was drinkable without being too harsh on the palate.  The total impression is like an amped up New Glarus Unplugged Olde English Porter - maybe that will take on some of the same characteristics in time.  It wasnt hard to finish two glasses but I would not want to drink a whole bottle by myself.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The flavor opened with tart currants and lesser berry notes with more woody and vinegary notes showing up across the middle.. finished tart and funky with more currants.

Taste was  funky tart with currants. Woody with some hints of cocoa behind the tartness. Well balanced with enough tartness to keep it interesting. It also has a sweet note that keeps it easy to drink at the same time it is being complex. This is a sour more along the lines of Rodenbach and I get why some that want mouthpuckering sourness find that to be a turn off. Everything about this beer hit me the right way. I would love to try it again. Awesome.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Flavor is incredible; tartness hits almost immediately, and gradually smooths out to a sweet and delicious finish.

3386,"2009-09-01",4.2,"A Mes rate. Bottle at home.Murky brown with a thin light beige head. Aroma is a stunner. Straight ten. Incredible fruit, tart cider apples, some dirt and pig farm funk, burly booze, awesome Russian River wooden notes, coca cola, freshly rain watered tarmac, poppy seeds and thick preserve fruit madness. Think that just about does it. The flavour is certainly not in the same league and in all honesty I was a little underwhelmed at first but it is gettin better by the sip. Amazing lemony sourness that is unique to Russian River. An intense lick of hardcore tart sweetness that is kicked to death instantly by the big bruising barrel notes. Sadly its a little to brief to really hit the spot. Excellent dryness and such a superb blend of sweet and sour. There is just something holding it back that I cant quite put my finger on. It has to be said that the wine notes are just perfect. Its really asking to be given a 9 but still there is something not letting me change the score. Maybe it just needs a little age.

Yet overall the taste is not that outstanding. Carbonation was above average, and this beverage did work with supper. An experience. Really good looking orangey off-white bubbly head, though a piece of black sediment rolled into the initial pour. Vinegar aroma which I am two minds about, one being the anticipation of a hard rocking palate cleanser, giving it the benefit of the doubt.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
3386,"2009-08-28",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2009 Bottle from zythum, what a generous trader!  Batch 1.  Pours a dark ruby reddish-brown color with a thick initial head that dies down to patches.  The aroma is overall fruity with yeast, berries, sour cherries, and red wine. This is sour, tart and rather dry.  More sour than any other RR sour Ive had so far.  Aged in Cabernet barrels this clearly has a lot of red wine-like character.  Plenty of fruity flavors, sour cherries, tart cranberry and currants.  Crisp and tangy with a little bite to it.  I start picking up whiffs of vinegar as it breaths as well as some vinegary flavors.  Consecration is a very good beer, no doubt about that, but I prefer Temptation or Beatification at this stage.  Id love to try the new batch of this beer and compare because its close to being as good as those other two.  Any criticism is really unfair, Im giving it a 4.2, just Russian River has set such a high standard in my book, especially Vinnies sours.

Nose has a pleasant sour cherry component, with light vinegar, and fig newton snacks.  Just as Im starting to enjoy it the brett funk kicks in and the fair reviewer side of me reminds me that barnyard is supposed to be good here.  The sourness dominates on the palate, with cherry taking some background to the fig newtons and vinegar.  Finish is long and vinegary, and really smacks you in the face with the flavors.

3386,"2009-08-16",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2012 Draft at Devils Den. Dark ruby-purple pour, large cream-colored head. Slightly vinous nose has very strong currant depth, loads of spice, malt, chocolate, and hints of alcohol. More currant in the flavor, sweet fruit pie-like desert here in addition to more chocolate. Almost no brett at this point. Very malty and heavy, but strong carbonation to give lift to the body. The alcohol isnt noticeable, but this is not a light, refreshing sour. Id prefer less currant and more brett, certainly something sour to cut the heavy sweetness and ultra-rich fruit.

Batch 1 bottle next to a Hanssens Cassis shows this beers limited capacity. Muted fruit notes and sugary malt exist under the alcohol and heavy body. Easily my least favorite sour from RR to date.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Nose is big and very wine-like, rubber, curranty Cabernet, sour Brett, fruity perfume, surprisingly malty, but I expect that will fade with time, and the sourness will build. Broad rich velvety palate, dry backbone but with plenty of fruit. Finish is constantly evolving and changing. A great beer/wine hybrid, and one of the best new world sours I have had to date.

The taste was delicately sour and some sweet fruit came through as the currants presented themselves.  There was a bit of a horseblanket/barnyard quality that added a very unique quality to the beer.  The finish was where the sourness was really amplified and felt.  This beer tended to be vinous, deep, complex, and with a bit of a wild and untamed characteristic; and of course, sour.  This was one of those beer experiences I didnt want to end.

Tartness hits quickly and is followed by notes of sour cherries, currants and wood.  Shows dry tannin flavors that remind me of an aged cabernet. Carbonation level is high and it could bed described as effervescent. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and maybe a little soft, but it works perfectly with this style.

Pours a rich plum color with some glowing red hues and a light, fluffy tan colored head that quickly burns out into a nice thin wispy ring around the glass. The aroma is filled with tart berries, touches of oak and just a plain overall sour aroma. The flavor is very much the same with tart berries being the first thing you taste and eventually allows for some oak and touches of earthy hops to shine through and finishes very dry. Its a very effervescent beer and is light bodied. This is quite a tasty beer. It has very nice sourness which doesnt blast you away but definitely makes you pucker. The alcohol is very well hidden and will sneak up on you if you arent careful as this is an easy drinker. Lovely, delicious stuff.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DiabolikDUB"
3386,"2009-07-09",4.7,"Original review date 4/17/2009 (batch 001X2) - into a Portsmouth snifter it goes after an excellent pop of the cork from this 750 corked & caged heavyweight.

Well, it pours with a ginger/maple head - about 1/3 finger - that looks like sponge candy for a brief instant then fades quickly into little yeast wisps. The body has a dark bourbon and dark cherries (OK, currants) color that has quite a calming effect. Moderate slow-moving carbonation.

The scent is present the second the cork goes. The brett is huge but its backed by a fruity sweetness of the currants with a light, husky oak barrel and wine tannic feel. Quite complex with a touch of hop pine and slight booziness. I expected it to be sweet but this is really well-integrated. Cant see too much of anything wrong with this.

The carbonation really shows up and brightens things a bit on taste. It gets together with the very soft and sour funk (not as heavy as a horse blanket - maybe a horse do-rag) and the oaky Cab character isnt a figment of ones imagination...nor is the poignant taste of currants. Way back when in the early 1980s Haagen-Dazs had a cassis (currant) sorbet available at their shop on the Upper West Side. It was one of those things that wasnt for everyone but we enjoyed the hell out of it. This brings back those tastes. Slightly austere but still pronounced currants along with the Cab tannin just makes this outstanding and the carbonation brings the delivery even greater strength. In fact Id almost want this to still a little bit to see how it would go. Quite luxurious to say the least. A little warmth brings out the expected horse blanket feel even further, which fits with everything else like a glove. Seriously Beautiful Chemistry going on here (look up Crackstatic and Ron Hawkins). This begs to be aged - like a young Cab there is a sense of tightness that begs for aging.

It took a while for my palate to embrace the concept of the Wild Ale but lots of good things take time. Surprisingly with time and warmth the dry oakiness of this gets to be more prominent and the straight sour texture of the currants is enhanced - the carbonation isnt going away and it helps hammer the point home. This one waxes and wanes - every moment the spotlight shines on a different element.

It doesnt take long to realize that this is indeed a 10% sledgehammer. But there is nothing that can diminish how good this thing is. My cellar awaits for another bottle. What will this taste like in a few years? I am drinking this very slowly but I am enjoying every sip. Not that Im a sour maven by any means but this is the best one Ive experienced to date. In-fucking-credible.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

In summation -- batch 1 has more of a funky currant twang, is a little thin in the body, and is just damn awesome.  A lot of black cherries and funk come out.  Batch 2 is more subtle but is awesomely well put together.  Amazing brett explosion, and a lot of qualities of good aged wild beers, if that makes sense.

Big juicy jammy currents mix with the cabernet influence pretty nicely.  The sourness doesnt get overbearing thankfully, partially due to the oak influence I think.

Aroma is very tart berry (nondescript berry, I would not have guessed currants).  Otherwise very earthy with a muddy tartness throughout.  The berry and tartness pop out the most.  Taste has more of a zing to it, particularly with a spiky, zingy mouthfeel (umm, yeah, zing, take it as it is).  There are lots of musty and musky berry flavors, even a bit of cherry.  Aftertaste has a bit of the alcohol coming though but its really covered up by the tart and berry flavors.

Aroma is indeed sour, slightly fruity, slightly floral, and of brown sugar. Flavor is very tart all the way through, and overpoweringly so. There is some sweetness and cherry/berry underneath the sourness, as well as breadiness, yeast. Pretty Belgian in character outside of the tart. You can also taste the wine cask the more you drink it. Very acidic; I feel like this is eroding the enamel off my teeth. Mouthfeel I found quite nice: Good medium carbonation and medium viscosity.

3386,"2009-05-06",4.9,"This is batch 001x3.
Appearance - Pours a beautiful dark mahogany color that absolutely shines when held up to the light. A light cream colored head rises up about half a finger and recedes to a small ringaround the edge.

Smell - Tart dark cherry, definitely a lot of wine coming through in a big way. It has a real, clean smell to it, like its, perfect? It is just an amazing smell, hard to describe with the right words.

Taste - This is my first real sour, so the fact that it is sour comes out the most first. It didnt hit me like a freight train though, it was, refreshing! This is hard to explain, like the smell. Whatever those Bretts and other bacterias and yeasts are contributing is something completely foreign and completely amazing at the same time to me. This tastes like a tart berry picked fresh from the bush. What kind of berry is that though? I am guessing it would have to be black currants, another new taste for me.

Mouthfeel - Wow, it is light, and it is perfectly carbonated. This is the kind of brew that I have been waiting for. It tickles the end of your tongue with every sip. It feels like it coats the mouth without giving you that feeling that it just wont go away.

Drinkability - I am glad this is a 750ml bottle, I will gladly drink this entire bottle to myself and wish I had more. This has opened new doors for me and I will be searching out sours in the very near future. This beer is amazing, and it is very much worth the hype. Wow.

3386,"2009-04-30",4.1,"Cheers to Drink4satan for sharing this bottle with me. It was poured into a bell shaped snifter glass with a thick initial head which faded quick and formed a thin ring around the outskirt of the glass. The color is a dark nut brown with a reddish tint to it. The aroma is very strong with some toasted almond, oak, dark fruit mainly black current, with a sweet sour finish to it. AS you take small sips and swish it around in your mouth you can feel it decarbonate and release all of the interesting and unique citric flavors on the palate. This beer should be served with a tums and a small slab of cheese to balance out the acidity. You can really taste the vanilla, oak, fruit and citrus as you sip the brew, but once it is gone the flavor leaves and does not leave much of an after taste in your mouth.

3386,"2009-04-30",4.5,"Kudos to cloudskipper for this mega-dank brewski! 750cl, poured into a crystal snifter. Pours a completely opaque, very deep crimson colour, almost like a stout. The head is beige, puffy, and mostly lasting. The nose is musty, dirty, and slightly acetic, with strong notes of oak, vanilla, ceder, cherry, black currants and horse blanket. The funk is not as predominant in the nose as I anticipated. The flavour, however, brings forth a kick a strongly acetic, bretty, and tart sourness that overwhelms the senses. The finish is salty and tart, but in a citric way. The currants create a delicate balance that makes sour, lemony quality a bit toned down. The alcohol is definitely a substantial part of a flavours, though it isnt a bad thing somehow. The mouthfeel is airy, and the light, yet spritzy carbonation makes up most of the body, though it does coat nicely at the end of every sip.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

Very wild on the tongue and lively in the mouth by not unpleasantly so.  Flavor shows some sour notes which is amazing when mixed with all the sweet flavors.  Light bitterness in the dry finish.

The aroma is surprisingly vegetal, actually kind of thin and lacking, with some olive and smoke notes. Not sour in the nose. There is in the flavor, for sure, but the currant notes dont blend especially well with the sour  as is often the case  and we are left with a beer that tries to bridge two kinds of beverage and doesnt do so particularly well. There is just little agreement between the sourness and the fruity wine notes.

A big opening of green plum flavor, surrounded by nice peppery wood and mouthwatering tartness, like the snap of a just under-ripe cherry, lemon on the lips in the finish.

Starts tart, sour, funky, with some brett and other bug flavors.  Becomes more fruity with pitted fruits in the middle.

The aroma is not too complex, with cranberries, rasberries, currants, sour cherries and wood.  The taste is mouthwateringly sour and effervescent, with the same flavor of tart fruit, mainly berries.

Pours a red brown, like a Flemish brown, ample head. Gorgeous aroma of fruit with vanilla oak coming abundantly on as it warms. Tart - lemon - but not overwhelmingly so, wood and caramel driving through the middle of the sour flavors. Very nice balance, dry tannic finish with a hint of must, recalling and old red wine and just a really fine whisper, very late, of sweet current skins. Sparkling mouthfeel with abundant but not overdone carbonation.  Superb beer. 9/4/9/5/17=4.4

Revisit at the Naked City sour tasting. To my surprise, this one was not particularly close to being the beer of the night. Its good, sure -- but its buttery and despite gorgeous tart cherry its in the low fours, not the mid fours. Id have called it at 9/4/8/4/16= 4.1. Ill drop it to a 4.3 and consider myself generous.

Third revisit at Toronado, draft on 3/25/10. Very good, but yeah, this is a 4.2 beer not a 4.4 beer. Ill drop to 4.2. 
Fourth revisit, Batch 001x1. Bottle. 8/27/10. Despite rumors that this one is on the downslide, I found it really good, maybe better than I remember from either of the previous two encounters. Musty red wine for sure, maybe mellower on the acidity. Buttery, yes, a bit. But it works and 4.2 I dont feel generous, just spot-on.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3386,"2009-04-17",4.4,"750ml bottle experienced with Ceebs25. I have heard about the many wonders this beer offers and it certainly did not let us down. It may be one of the most difficult beers I have ever had to describe/rate. It pours a murky, but non particle filled, ruby brown body. The head is finger-width, khaki brown, and extremely soapy. It leaves a lot of soapy lacing on the glass and a hurricane-like spinning head on the surface. The aroma is complex and inviting. Lots of things going on here. A noticeable sour aroma, but not the typical vinegar aroma of lesser quality sours. Lots of dates, grapes, currants and dark sugary fruits with a light lemon. Mostly a noticeable caramel, burnt sugar date aroma as it warms. Then again, there is a good amount of woody wine sangria barrels. Lots of cherries and fig as well. I really cant explain the limitless aromas/flavors in this beer. The flavor is very similar. A more noticeable oak, aged wine flavor than the aroma. Slightly tart, but extremely smooth and oily. A bit of funky, cheese-like tart. Its like biting into an overripe plum. Its slightly sour, slightly tart, slightly sweet, and fresh. Palate is surprisingly easy drinking for a sour. Overall, I could go on forever about this, but I had to limit myself. This is an extraordinary beer and opens my mind to the limitless possibilities of what sours can offer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3386,"2009-04-17",4.4,"750 mL bottle (Thank you Pawola for sharing!).  I was very excited about this one going in, and was expecting great things from the start even though i hadnt too much experience with this style.  Long story short, it did not disappoint.  A very pleasant, smooth, oily aroma.  The oak aging definitely comes through right away.  Not as acetic vinegar in the smell, more of a mellow candy sour.  Dates and fig, along with a sweeter red wine, and light berry.  A great smelling beer.  Pour is also quite nice, with a bubbly soapy beige cream head, retention is nice with a pretty carbonation swirl in the middle, rather murky in its body, but not overly heavy, dark sangria in color.  A wonderful feeling beer.  Silky and oily, with the right amount not overly tart sour bite to bring the flavor out fully.  Many of the same notes in the aroma in the flavor... oak, dates and fig (which i guess would be currants), Cabernet, and some lighter berries along with a bit of cranberry.  Cherries are also a big player, along with a little bit of funk.   This description cant fully describe all the things going on here as theres a piece Im missing that ties the sweet and sour together, maybe plum but not quite.  Ultimately, this is by far the best of the style Ive had to this point, very complex, and really just a great tasting experience.  Definitely lives up to its world class rating.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

Aromas were sour and fruity, not a hint of acetic acid to be found, very floral and woody and nice... along with a strong malty/sugary base.  The flavors just explode... sour fruits, sweet dark roasted malt, wine-barrel funk, brettanomyces, and god knows what else.  This is one beer that is really deceiving when it comes to alcohol content.  It does NOT seem like its at 10%!  Dangerous.  But an awesome beer.

This beer poured a mahognay brown with some ruby highlights and a fizzy, highly carbonated two-finger thick head of tan foam that quickly settled into a lasting cap.  Some slippery lacing.  The aroma included strong oak, vinous dark fruits, and lightly sweetened tart currants.  Some lightly sour notes.  Definately a strong wine character.  Nice mix of sweet and sour.  The flavor displayed a fairly intense oaky, wine barrel character.  Tart currants followed by a mellow acidity.  A lingering woody, cherry pit note was left on the tongue.  The 10% ABV was undetected.  Finished mostly dry, but there was still some unexpected sweetness lingering.  Medium-bodied with crisp, aggressive carbonation.  Very well done.

Aromas are wonderful sourness and funk, mixed with some oaky dryness and vanilla. Fruit is powerful, pears, cherries, grapefruit, and currants dominate. Initial displays a wonderful body, darker malts with a touch of chocolate are humped into submission by a wonderful sourness and funkiness from the brett. Oak, cabernet, woody dryness rear their heads in moderate amounts. Potent, leaving a quality sourness and funk on the palate. Fruits are good, but sourness balances, crisp and enjoyable with currant, cherries, grapefruit, and red wine making up the fruit. Finish is sour, funk, and red wine.

The flavor follows with more dark fruits, cherries, figs, and the currants to go with the lactic vanilla, and oak tannins. The bretty hasnt completely dried things out so the sourness is more subtle than I thought. Medium bodied and slightly dry with just the right amount of carbonation which helps this drink real easy.

3386,"2009-03-13",4.0,"Courtesy hopscotch.  Ive anticipated this beers release for about a year now.  The pour yields a cloudy, glowing, rusty sienna colored body with a lasting, pillowy, cream colored head.  Minimal, spotty lacing shows on the glass.  Aromas include a dark, fruity malt base rich with currants and some sour cherry.  Dry cocoa adds a hint of sweetness, while soft, oaky vanilla lends a perfumy, lightly woody overtone.  Traces of bretty funk add an earthy character.  Flavors show more dark fruits, primarily tart dark cherry, fig, and currant, mild sourness being tempered by the soft, oaky carress.  The body is substantial and semi-dry, perfectly carbonated, but lacking that funky tart finish that sets other Russian River beers apart.  Its insane to call a beer that I rated 4.0 a letdown, but it almost is as my expectations were really through the roof.  It definitely feels like it will benefit exponentially from some bottle aging, sourness and dryness improving with time.  Good now, but probably great in a year.

3386,"2009-03-12",4.2,"750, corked and baled. Pours a crystal clear but staggeringly dark ruby red--almost black, way beyond burgundy. Dense, tightly foamy off-white head that lasts and lasts past several sips. Gorgeous right around. Big sour nose. Got that lacto balsamic thwack as soon as you pull the cork, and definitely lights up your sinuses when you get your nose in the glass. Im guessing theres a currant thing happening, not that I can remember smelling a currant. But somewhere between a berry-skin tannic note and a bit of dark pitted tree fruit, theres a sweet, fruity note complementing the lacto. Nicely combined.The bodys clean and tight, lower than medium, maybe, and very little carb. Refreshing like fruit juice, especially when cool. If this werent the incredible beer that it is, something that tasted exactly like it would probably be widely popular as a mixer for cocktails. So, yeah, its not crazy sharply tart--mixed well, lots of people would drink a cocktail that contained one or two parts of something like this. Not sure where this metaphors going, so lets just cut it off here.The mid-palate is rather less complex than some of the RR sours, which of course gives it plenty of room to operate. Lacto/balsamic, dark berry skins, dark pitted tree fruit, some dense oak notes. This is a very pleasant and drinkable sour all the way through for sure.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

As expected, the flavor is sour, tart, and slightly acidic, but well balanced and just enough to be interesting and enjoyable without going over the edge.

Flavor is an amazing mix of sour black currants, rich sour cherries, well oaked Cab Sauv, wet wood, and a raw dark fruit flavor that is pretty damn nice.  Mouthfeel is amazing with sour & tart tannic goodness that crawls up the tongue.  A little more heat than I would like (probably my only criticism) but this has a good deal more alcohol than most RR sours (it works by the way).  This is the best of the sour world mixed with tasty black currants and given the proper treatment in Cabernet Sauvingon Barrels (my favorite wine vareital when done properly).

Fruit and barrel really up front with the funk taking a backseat. That being said, its still a pretty aroma. Pours a very attractive dark, dark amber/brown with some ruby around the edges. A thick light khaki head eventually settles. Flavor starts out rather soft and restrained but ends up finishing rather acidic. The currants really come through mid-palate. Woodsy funk throughout. Fruit and wood tannin toward the backend. The fruit runs deep through the entire flavor, but never becomes overly sweet... a tartness more akin to pomegranates. Medium to full bodied. Creamy carbonation with a rather aggressive finish.  No way in hell this is 10%. Another excellent offering from Russian River, but falls short of the newest batch of Supplication.

I had it the night before in the bottle and was feeling it, but not crazily. Then I had it on tap. Awesome aroma of oak, sour funk, tart berry notes. Pours dark red with a really nice softer red hue and a decent head. Tart and oaky up front followed by some fruity earthy berry notes on the mid palate. Lingering oak and tart citric sour notes, but not in a shock to the taste buds kind of way, but more in a this works very well together kind of way. Nice and smooth body, no hints of booze at all. This one could be dangerous really.

3386,"2009-03-03",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2010 Batch 001X2.  Pours a hazy, dark ruby color with a very fizzy, yellowish-beige, fairly small head which diminishes very quickly and leaves nothing; carbonation is persistnent for quite some time.  Nose is pungent and amazing; black currants noticed immediately which is followed immediately by light molasses, overripe cherries, dates, faint burnt caramel, light vanilla, light wet oak, light maple, some raisin, some blackberry, and probably other notes that I missed.  Its vinous, its jammy, its lightly tart, its delicately sweet, its overwhelmingly complex; awesome.  Before the flavor, I must discuss the palate; the carbonation is just too fizzy to allow the awesome flavors develop; light to medium, fizzy, and faintly silky but drying just a touch.  The flavors are amazing with fruity, jammy, vinous notes up front (black currants, blackberry jam, lighter cranberry) followed by tart notes of overripe cherries and light bretty acetic notes, and the oak melds everything together being wet and earthy; underneath is faint burnt caramel, faint molasses, and hints at vanilla.  The progression from fruity notes to tart notes to oak notes with sweet undertones is perfect.  Finishes average length with some old world wine notes being earthy, slightly funky, a bit of vanilla, and wet oak; lightly drying from some tannins.  I may have made a huge mistake opening this one so early, especially considering the price.  However, my only real complaint is the carbonation level; it created a less-than-adequate appearance and took away from the flavors, not to mention the palate was only acceptable because of it.  Insane nose, great melding of flavors, and balanced at every step.  Perfect balance of vinous notes, tart/sour notes, sweet undertones, and oak.  Hopefully well see what this could become in a few years.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Lots of oak, currants, cherries, oak, and cabernet. There is an underlying tartness that hints at whats going to follow in the flavor. Flavor initially hits with some lactic sourness and a hint of the currants. That is followed by the dry oakiness of the wine barrels and their prior contents.

3386,"2009-03-03",4.9,"22oz bottle. This is a very special beer to me because I never expected that I would love this as much as I did. I mean I knew I would like it as I tend to like all Russian River stuff but this beer is in a class all its own and it marks 2 firsts for me, my first score above 4.8 and my first time rating an overall impression of 20. Pours a darkish red remiscent of a fine wine with a small quickly collapsing head. Lovely color. The head releases a intoxicating aroma of black currants, oak, wine and sourness (subdued). However after the head collapses which happens quickly this aroma goes away and some of the complexity is lost, the lone blemish on this astonishing beer. The flavor profile is simply amazing. Oaky sourness opens up but remains tart and not acidic nor balsamic, its a very balanced sourness. Alcohol is non existant, making this dangerously easy to drink. Like a fine with moderate acidity and balanced tartness. A slow oaky finished followed by absolutely mind blowing notes of black currant and cherry skins. This beer is a marvel. I had this at a tasting of about 10 people. Everyone agreed this was the best of the night even though only 3 of us like sours and several of them hate them. This is a very accesible sour ale. And this beer was up against class competition in Port Old Viscoscity and Dark Island Reserve. This one blew everyones minds.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
3386,"2009-03-01",4.2,"On tap pours dark red with a small white head that diminishes quickly. Sort of looks like wine after the head settles. The bottled version had more carbonation producing a stronger head and more acidity. One tap the beer was a bit more mellow, allowing more of the currant flavor to come through. Dry and acidic with the sourness. Oak comes though mostly in the dryness, but softly woody and earthy in the finish. Seems like the currants add most of the sweetness to this beer. I slightly prefer the draught version of this I had, it seems to be a touch more mellow and the acidity wasnt as sharp, but both were really top notch.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3386,"2009-03-01",4.4,"750ml, batch 001x4.  Pours a muddy, very dark red/brown with a small but somewhat sustained off-white head.  Aroma shows huge oak, mild funk and strong fruit.  The oak is very strong, certainly the strongest presence Ive encountered in a RR barrel aged beer.  It borders on overdone but thankfully sits right on the edge without going over. Oak reminds me of a Scotch or Irish whiskey. Funk is semi-mild for a RR sour, certainly present, some Brett noticeable but acetic and lactic acid is somewhat tame.  Fruit is plum and subtle sour cherry, quite vinous but I dont get much wine in the nose.  I dont know what currants smell like so who knows if theyre noticeable.

Flavor is nicely tart, not as sour as something like Supplication or Temptation, yet.  Fruitiness is strong and pleasant.  Dry finish.  The wine really comes out in the flavor in a good way.  This is a nice beer.  Overall this beer reminds me A LOT of Oerbier reserve.  The appearance, aroma and taste are all right in that ballpark.  So close really that a blind tasting without knowing what this is would make me think this was that beer.  I think this beer will get better with age.  Some flavor melding, souring, and milding oak would improve this beer.  I dont like this as much as Supplication or probably even Temptation but this is quality.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

A dark garnet highlight might appear when the light hits it right.  The aroma first comes across as dark sour fruit with a sweet grapeyness to it.  Earthy and woody undertones emerge,combined with a softly tannic vionous character.  The currants come through, not directly, but as a general fruity sweet-tartness that adds another layer to the already enormous complexity present here.  The flavor begins with prominient yet restrained sourness in the attack that leads into a deep, multi-layered fruit profile that is surrounded by wonderful secondary fermentation flavors, barrel-aged oxidadtion notes, and subtle oak influences.  The body is amazingly bright and refreshing and completely hides the alcohol.  Its force is instead delivered through the amazing variety of sensations on the palate--good weight, bright sourness, pure sweet fruit, dark wood and earth.  It is simultaneously juicy, rounded, edgy, firm, and voluptuous.  The is one of the most amazing beers Ive ever tasted.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Densely carbonated. Gentle sting of alcohol briefly quells the initial irony-laden tartness. Quite hollow and airy at the center, with the snappy brett-derived phenols and gritty-iron-clasp displacing the curiously ghostlike malt. Clean yet merely suggestive pale malts take on some strawlike bounce toward the finish, but fail to impart any substantial heft or depth along the way. Fairly simplistic due to the prevalent iron-tinged lacto twang and nonexistent malt sweetness. Juicy smack of currants dovetails with the raspy iron and coarse mineralic bite, though due to the rampant, unchecked tartness, the fruit character is largely reminiscent of dried strawberries, unripe plums and peaches rather than boasting a deep, fresh-picked succulence. Oak graces the palate with a dusty dryness, but is otherwise muted. Steadily wavering notes of Band-Aid and crunchy phenolics succumb to the pervasive lacto twang and faint medicine. Closes with a fluffy dollop of pale malt, though with a slightly clashing tart and gritty mixture of iron, medicine, leather, minerals and unripe fruit. Darn, was really hoping the bottle conditioning would impart additional nuance and send this into the realm of otherworldliness. I find this to be marginally superior  namely in mouthfeel and appearance  to the draft version I tasted six months ago. While this is certainly skillfully crafted and refined, as are all of Vinnies bottled creations, this is in dire need of some soft, full, sweetish malts to both complement the pale malts while cushioning the mineralic briskness, slight astringency and one-dimensional acidity.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Well carbonated for the style which balanced the alcohol and tart, sour characteristics.  I could feel the alcohol going down my esophagus which was pretty warming.  Some flavors of oak and wild yeast which was noticeable but not as smooth and tart/sour as I would hope.  Still one hell of a (A+) beer though.

3386,"2009-02-16",3.9,"(Bottle from 001X3). Good Lord this had some serious carbonation. The pressure behind the cork was more than one of Frances best champagnes. Unfortunately, it also started to foam up out of the neck and a some drops made it to the carpet. Pours very carbonated into the bottle with effervescent head that you can hear in the glass. It falls quickly like a glass of cola. Aroma not huge, but you can smell the bugs in the whiff. Flavor is interesting. Clear sourness of the brett/lacto/ped mixture, especially when you role it over your tongue and its gazillion taste buds. You also have a finish of the currants its supposed to have. Clean palate with no real lingering. The description says it is fermented in Cabernet Savignon barrels, which I can taste (or perhaps its just my imagination?). Kind of surprised in that Im not getting any warming effect despite the alcohol is 10%. Also, its a very lightweight body beer.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

The flavor is very tart cherry, with oak undertones and a vanilla backwash. Believe it or not, it tastes quite a bit like Schaarbeekse Kriek, probably due to the addition of currants.

Medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a moderate acidity.  Currant fruit flavors up front with a tingling tartness.  Some mild malt sweetness is left lingering on the palate, but it melds nicely with the fruit sugars.  Lots of tannic grape flavors, but some softer notes of plum, and of course, currants add some roundness to the fruit profile.  Finishes moderately dry with a lingering black pepper yeasty spice.

Pours a deep, clear copper with a decent bubbly cream head that dissipated quickly to a thin collar.

The aroma is wonderfully complex with the slightly sharp currant sweetness on top of a sugary sweetness. The barrel characteristics are also present with hints of vanilla in the nose. The brett is there to lend an ever-so-slight sourness with a complementary earthy funk in the background.

The taste seems to be a more complex and balanced version of the nose. The sweetness hits up front with the light tartness of the currants balanced by the underlying sugars. The brett makes its presence felt but the finish is very vinous with the oak playing a role as well.

The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and very wine-like with a dry finish and bits of funk throughout.

Clear ruby brown with a small beige head, fading to a thin ring before long, and served in a snifter. Big oak and red wine nose up front with the vinegar and sour apple notes next. Buttery brett and leather peak out stronger as I nose this, and its hard to pick out the sweet dark fruit that is Salvation in the base beer. Whoo! Flavor is full of tons of sour fruits and berries with a definite dry red wine and oak (lots of oak) finish. Sour factor peaked ~ a 6-7,and I wanted to add there was some low earthy bitterness in the backend as well. Im hard-pressed to find any Salvation in this.

No head, but surprisingly effervescent.  Thinner mouthfeel than anticipated.  The oak and Cabernet taste is quite strong and is a good counterpart to the sourness.

3386,"2008-11-19",4.3,"Sampled at the 2008 Great American Beer Festival. Another backlogged rating. By far one of my favorite specialty barrel-aged ales of the festival. Deep, opaque brown color with faint beige lacing. Beautiful nose of tart currants and oak wood. Well-balanced fruity flavor with a lactic acidity providing a strong, but near perfect amount of tartness for this type of sour beer. The big oak character with the currants lends a nice vinous wine note to the beer. Overall, very nicely rounded.

Medium-to-full mouthfeel: loads of intensely sour and strongly acidic cherries and citrus, black cherries, and moderately tannic cabernet notes; strongly vinous, dense wine-barrel presence, more prominent cabernet notes than I can think of in any other barrel-aged beer, while still very drinkable and gorgeously bittersweet; very nice beer, very nice barrel.

3386,"2008-10-31",4.5,"Sampled Falling Rock, GABF week 2008
I was able to sneak into a spot at the bar and got one of the first glasses of this, the first keg blew in 5 minutes (before Chris even had a chance to announce it was on tap) and the second only lasted an additional 15 minutes; I was definitely quite lucky to get two glasses of this beer.  The beer arrives with quite a clear appearance, it is the hue of a raisin with a rich concentrated color and shows a deep red hue when held up to the light.  It is topped by a pale, ring of a heat that after a bit forms a brown tinged, full tan colored head that just covers the beer.  The aroma definitely has a tartness to it, but also has a rich, thick fruitiness to it that reminds me of a mix of concentrated tamarind, syrupy-fruity balsamic vinegar and rich raisins.

As the beer first hits my tongue it is chewy and rich; a sour beer with a substantial texture (at the time I didn’t realize how strong this beer was, but in hindsight the richness makes a lot of sense).  Tannins coat my teeth and there is a soft, yet noticeable barrel character in the finish that adds a spicy oak bite.  Rich raisin flavors, a substantial berry-like wine note, as well as some rich dried fig and prune flavors all combine to provide a big, fruit-driven backbone that anchors the flavor of this beer.  The rich fruit and oak flavors is tempered by a mouth puckering, somehow rich, sourness that is mostly lactic in character but sees to have some acetic overtones to it that reminds me of some sort of berry vinegar as well as hints of a rich, grape balsamic notes.  The beer almost develops a raspberry flavor at times, and this actually is pretty nice (says someone who generally shies away from raspberry flavors in beer).  As I contemplate my second glass of this beer I start to notice more of the oak flavors coming to the fore with flavors of vanilla, light coconut that is sort of Bourbon-like somehow as well as a structured wine character and a definite berry note that seems like a wine signature.

I haven’t said this yet, but this beer is just fantastic.  It has an incredible balance of tartness to rich fruit and light, though structured oak character.  The flavor is just so well integrated, everything just seems to work together to carry this beer up to another level of complexity and interest.  The oak really does add lots of structure, which goes a long way towards helping the overall balance of this beer.  I like that the incredibly rich fruit character never gets overwhelming (back to that balance again).  This is an awesome beer, whose enjoyment I am sure was magnified by the setting as well as he prior afternoon session of the GABF.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3386,"2008-10-27",4.4,"GABF ’08.   A beauty of a beer...the acidic, teasing sour itch works perfectly w/ the red wine oak and fruit additives.  I like the currants here, they do it right.  With more plum/cherry taste.  Sticky and warming, prickly carbonation.  Just wonderful.  I can only picture the bottle version to be ridiculous.

Smooth, tart entry leads into a moderate fruitiness with hints of currants and red grapes leading into a funky barnyard yeastiness followed by some acedic sourness with some tart citrus fruits and some drying oak on the finish.

Surprisingly uninspiring.  Had a glass all to myself and spent a good while with it, but it never really did much for me.  Its pleasant, no doubt, and clean, but...kind of aimless.  Huge fan of most of Vinnies Belgian style brews, but not so much for this one.  Would have rated it a bit higher (3.8 maybe?) from the one GABF sample I had, but it was a different story with a full glass...it became fatiguing pretty quickly for some reason (too heavy and sweet)...I literally didn’t finish my glass.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
