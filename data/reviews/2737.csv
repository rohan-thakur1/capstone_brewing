2737,"2014-12-04",3.9,"From notes. Tasted on 6/5/13 on draft at the brewpub during a baseball trip with Adam and Taylor. Pours pale golden with a thick white head that slowly recedes to average lace, leaving sticky residue along the inside of the glass. The nose is full of spicy hops with a nice nutty lager note, and a very clean green hops aroma. The flavor is nutty up front, moving to an earthy yeast note, and finishing with the same nicely green and bitter hops from the nose. The body is light with lively carbonation and a long nicely bitter, very clean finish. This is a killer lager.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

2737,"2013-11-10",3.3,"500 ml bottle shared by phaleslu (06 /2013). Pours a clear bright golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma and flavor have toasted grainy malts, grass, herbal notes, light bready character with just a splash of fruit. Not a bad lager, just not my thing.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2737,"2013-07-03",3.3,"Draft at Urban Chestnut. Pours hazy with a creamy white head. Nose is pretty grassy, low malt and an odd solventy note in the nose. On tasting, mid bitterness, soft malt and a hot alcohol note. A bit too light and alcohol driven. Meh.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
2737,"2013-06-23",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2013 Tap at the Global Brew. Pours a pale slighty cloudy golden with a thin white head that stays. Aroma is yeast, bread, and spice. Taste is pale sweet malt, bread and mild hops.","OÂ’Fallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
2737,"2013-06-17",3.8,"Bottle (marked 438 of 1500). Pours with a mostly clear golden hue with a large fluffy eggshell hued head. Good lace, decent retention. Aromas are of floral and fruity noble like hops, nutty, bready and toasty. Rich pils like malt profile. Grassy. Clean, light sulfur, light chlorophyll. Smells very tasty. Flavors have a smooth malty richness, toasty, bready, pils like. Mildly grainy. Very clean, slightly sweet malt perception, medium dry finish. Quite crisp. Light herbal and grassy notes. Somewhat firm bitterness but a neutral balance. Medium to low body with moderate carbonation. Checks the right boxes. An idyllically drinkable lager with huge hop aroma and a soft malt balance.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2737,"2013-06-11",3.4,"Tasted on tap at the brewery in a Willbecher glass. It poured a clear golden colour with a thin but long-lasting white foam, some lace. Familiar lager characteristics, except well-done. Very strong noble hops bitterness and flavor, the aroma was nice but comparatively muted: earthy, flowery, notes of wildflower honey, vanilla, black pepper, combining with the alcohol to produce a perfume. Crisp grainy but otherwise neutral maltbill. Light body, average carbonation, surprisingly well-rounded mouthfeel, warming alcohol, fruity and bittersweet aftertaste. Nice, but I have to admit, a little too bitter for me to consider perfectly balanced.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
2737,"2013-06-04",3.2,"16.7oz bottle, 1465 of 1500, shared by phaleslu. Mildly hazy golden color. Good white head. Nice bits of lace. Nice bready aroma, lightly peppery flavior. Medium body. Lighter carbonation. Kind of soft but smooth, with a dry finish. Nice light bitter taste, lighter sweet. Very solid lager.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2737,"2013-06-04",3.5,"500 ml bottle from a local STL trader. Pours a clear gold color with a white head. Notes of grass, lots of grains, crackers, sawdust, stale cereal, and mild spices. Light-bodied, with medium (deceptively sharp) carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. Nice lager.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

2737,"2013-05-19",3.6,"On tap at the source... Pours a mostly transparent although lightly hazy apricot orange and topped with a creamy white head... Lemons and grassy notes upfront followed up with semi-sweet pale grainy backing. More herbal grassiness comes through late once again... Light spice and grassy notes upfront. Lightly sweet through the middle and finishes more bitter than expected but nice that it cuts down on the sweetness. Lighter than medium bodied with mild prickly carbonation.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
2737,"2013-05-13",3.2,"Sampled at TWCP Beer Fest 2013.  It poured a cloudy yellow color with  a small white head. The aroma was malty, with some earthiness, a little bready and some grassy hops. The taste was similar to the aroma with a light to medium body and some carbonation.  Tasty.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
2737,"2013-05-10",3.8,"Pint bottle.  Lightly hazed and golden.  A thick creamy off white head is three fingers and falls in the middle.  A sweet malty and grainy aroma.  Some floral and honey notes.  The first sip surprises me with grass and bitterness.  Hops are floral as well as grassy.  Bitterness is dry.  The after taste of the first sip is spicy and long lasting.  Hops dominate the flavors here and are airy and bright.  Malts are pale and there is some biscuit.  A little lemon in that grass.  This is really nice.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
2737,"2013-04-27",3.0,"Pour is a hazy yellow with a large white head.  Aroma is a nice grassy hop with some dry cracker malts.  Flavor is a super clean almost pils malt with more of the grassy/floral hops.  FInish is again clean and fleeting.  This was a fine well made lager.  Very tasty and shows you in the right hands a lager can be considered craft beer.  Definatly a high rated lager.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
2737,"2013-04-03",3.1,"April 3, 2013 - bottle from Randalls.  Cloudy yellow pour with limited head.  Aroma was bready, malty and earthy / grassy hops.  Taste was consistent with aroma, but there was a funky aftertaste that I did not enjoy.  Light to medium body with some carbonation.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
2737,"2013-03-28",4.1,"When it comes to pilsners and lagers no one does it as well in this area as well as Urban Chestnut, and this is no exception.  Pours clear golden with a soapy white head.  The aroma has fresh bread, spicy hops, lots of smooth lager maltiness (not too sweet though), fresh cut grass and a hint of grapes - fantastic aroma.  Medium body that starts off smooth and velvety then has more of a crisp refreshing character when the carbonation hits.  The flavor starts out with spicy/grassy hops that makes it seem bright, fresh and green.  The malt from the aroma is there as well, but the hops are up front.  The finish is grassy and dry.  This is one of those beers you could easily drink and enjoy the easy drinking aspect paying little attention or analyze and find lots of interesting subtle aspects.  Really love this beer.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2737,"2013-03-28",3.8,"(tap at Hopfenfest) dark amber with white head. Grassy hops aroma. Flavor is lager malt with a nice grassy hops flavor.","Manchester, Missouri, USA","kwoeltje"
