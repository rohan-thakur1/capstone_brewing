2229,"2016-10-25",3.9,"Huge disclaimer: I really dont know how to judge ""Aroma"" in decimals, since my mind processes only binary code (""Mmmm....smells like delicious, delicious beer..."" or ""Hrm....hope it at least *tastes* like beer""...)

Neither can I accurately adjudge the appearance, frequently, since I am 

a) wholly, happily ignorant of what color various styles are ""supposed"" to be and 

b) I dont care at all if a style looks improper and because

c) I am frequently guzzling straight from the bottle like a freaking Visigoth so 

d) I dont always know what the actual color of the beer is.

That being said...

I cracked this Hacker-Pschorr ""Original Oktoberfest"" (aliased, apparently from the ""Oktoberfest-Marzen). It turned out to be very far away from the decent but unremarkable mass-produced German beer it appeared to be. 

It is full-mouthed, malty, non-hoppy, slightly sweet, notes of ochre and hominy.

2229,"2016-09-19",3.1,"Pours a vibrant golden-amber colored beer with a huge, creamy white head.

Smells of fresh cut grass, dried garden herbs and a cookie dough malt backbone with a note of wild honey instead of chocolate, wrapped up by straw. 

Has a lively, well fitting mouthfeel, adding a refrehing feel to the light bodied, otherwise malty and straw defined beer. 

Tastes of sweet straw, with a fizziness from the bubbly carbonation, which adds a coppery hint, blending into the malts. Turns even sweeter during the mid palate with a late dry quality, bringing forest leafes to the palate, adding some depth to the so far one dimensional drinking experience.

An easy drinker, which turns out to be a tad too sweet to convince entirely. Its malty straw profile defines the taste from the beginning till the end, with not much else going on.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2229,"2014-08-05",3.6,"Transfer from BA review on 9-7-12 - 
 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance Served a clear orange amber colored beer with a tiny white head. The head faded quite fast to leave only the tiniest amount of lacing.

 Smell  The smell was light. It consisted largely of some toasted malt, a bready aroma, and some sweet caramel.

 Taste  A roasted malt flavor greets the tongue. It begins of a smooth light toast flavor mixed with a hint of breadines and caramel sweetness. Toward the middle the sweetness from the caramel increases which is accompanied by some loss of the roasted flavor. Toward the end however some roasted malt taste comes back, accompanied by some toast flavors and a light citrus hop flavor, which in the end leave a nice light roasted sweetness to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the light to medium side in terms of its thickness and creaminess, with a very average carbonation level. Very good for the style and very easy drinking.

 Overall  Mostly a pretty good Octoberfest. It has a decent roasted and bready flavor and is quite easy drinking and refreshing. Not a bad choice.","","Darkmagus82"

2229,"2012-10-20",3.3,"Ive tried all the mainstream German Oktoberfestbiers I can get and one thing Ive noticed is that none of them have any real hop presence. Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest seems to be the exception as there is a noticeable, but reserved, amount of spicy hops and a fairly clean palate with subtle sweetness. Not a delicious beer by any means, but probably the best of the mediocre bunch.

I poured an 11.2oz bottle into my OktoBEERfest mug.

Appearance: Very dark amber color, almost straight up brown. Clear with some calm carbonation visible. Forms a rather small, off-white, soapy head which dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass.

Smell: A noticeable skunky aroma at first (likely due to the dark olive-green bottle color), its easily tolerable and ignored. Otherwise its a mild aroma thats generic lager at the core.

Taste: Upon my first swig of Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest I noticed something I hadnt in any other German brews of the style: hops. Or to be more precise: bitterness. Its not this is a high IBU beer full of citrus or pine flavor, just that theres more kick to this palate than most. The palate is mostly clean - like a dark lager with all the off-flavors and undesirable qualities removed. You can tell its a lager but it doesnt scream ""lager"" on the tongue. A consistent bitterness throughout with mild toffee sweetness on the second half. Just as it finishes the bitterness reemerges for a swift kick of spice before fading away cleanly. Its only a degree or two better than most beers of this sort, but enough to warrant a genuine thumbs up from me (dont expect me to jump for joy about it, though).

Drinkability: Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest seems to be a bit more crisp than most, but the mouthfeel is still comfortable and the finish is just as smooth as the rest - if not more so. Its a little bit refreshing, too. The 5.8% ABV weight is about the same as most, but at least this one has a little more body to it.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The beer is copper hued with an inch of thick, creamy head. The aroma offers malt, fairly sweet, a bit fruity. A nice drinkable seasonal brew. A bit of grain with a balance of fruity lager and a light bitterness in the finish. Light to medium in body with solid carbonation. Hooray beer!

Caramel and toffee esters in the aroma, but it isnt a sweet smelling beer by any means. Malted biscuits come in to play as the beer warmed a little.

Toffee again in the taste, a lot going on though, some cereal flavours are also present, then hazel nuts came to mind as I sipped my way down the glass.

Dark malts on the nose along with some light smelling hops that are blended throughout. There is a sweet brown sugar type aroma along with some earthy hops towards the middle and the end. I can also sense some biscuit like notes towards the end.

Brownish amber with a clear body and a thin, bubbly white head that slowly recedes to a thin and patchy, soapy lacing around the top of the beer.

The taste is mainly made up from caramel and the earthy hops from the nose along with hoppy, biscuit malts. There is a warm and mildly bitter finish to the beer.

This one had a warm, medium body with a thick and mildly bitter finish, overall carbonation is mild here.

Not amazing but a solid effort from this one, its not the best Hacker-Pschorr beer that I have tried but the brewery usually produces enjoyable beers. It went down easily enough and had some good malty flavours throughout but its probably not one I would recommend.

The taste was moderately sweet with a light hint of caramel in the beginning and finished with a nice malty sweet flavor that had a mild hoppiness to it at the end. The flavor stayed with you for a decent amount of time allowing for the taste buds to fully enjoy all this brew has to offer.

Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and dry yet just a little oily in texture with a nice soft carbonation.

Overall the maltiness and mild sweetness of this brew works so wonderfully together. No wonder they call it the original. This just so happens to be the first Oktoberfest I ever tasted many years ago and in my opinion still is one of the best.","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

Pours a nice light amber/copper.orange, enabling you to see through it. Very weak head, very little to no lacing.

Light aromas of grain(s), malt and grassiness, with faint tea-like scents. Pretty mediocre on the nose.

Grains, some tea-like and maybe light nuts land on the tongue. Malt is present, but less noticeable than it should be. Low carbonation. Body is rather thin.

Its probably the least Oktoberfest Marzen Ive had to date. Less malty, thin body and weak head and lacing hurts the credentials of this brew. its decent, but you can do a lot better.

Pours with a 3 finger head into my mug with an amber body. There is a slight bit of foam that resides on top of the liquid that never dissipates.

Smell is a bit subdued for a typical Maerzen, with a nice hop and malt balance. The malts have that typical sweet, nutty maltiness, though it is a bit faint.

The mouth feel is smooth and a bit under carbonated. Intense Oktoberfest flavor though. I love the taste of this, perfect sweet and nutty, slightly roasty malt taste, amazing hop balance, just a highly quaffable beer. Not the most robust version of this style out there, but in terms of taste, it is the standard flavor of Oktoberfest.

Overall it is a solid Oktoberfest, and like all examples of the style it has its strengths and weaknesses.

RERATE
This has been a perennial oktoberfest for me over the years, the ever so slightly clearer/lighter look has always appealed. This is my first and last bottle of this year (presumably) Pours a very clear amber color. Frothy head. Aroma is thick with bready malt flavors, smells worty almost, just a touch of earthy hops. Flavor is again worty, but with a crisp low bitterness that just cuts through, it is mildly nutty, though the malt character is visceral it isnt sweet at all, but fairly dry. The hops in the flavor bring more of an herbel marmalade feel, the body is not heavy and very drinkable. This proves again and again despite me drinking it 6 months too late it is everything a dark oktoberfest should be.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

S- Nose is mild and consists of caramel malt, pale malt, and hops. I cant really identify what type of hops...but they are definately there.

T- Much like the smell initial flavor of caramel and German pale malt with a touch of hoppy flavor overtone. The finish is much like the initial flavor but the hops come out just a wee bit more. Nothing lingers which makes you want more.

P- Nice lightweight lager mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Goes down really easy. Not too thin.

Aroma is fairly faint actually, some earthiness with decent Munich malts and Hallertrau hops. Flavour is good, but again, kind of bland and faint. Nice and malty sweet the whole way through, but dominated by a lot of weird dry hoppy astringency followed by a surprising alcoholic kick. Medium, slightly full mouth-feel, which works to its advantage. Despite the unpleasant unexpected aspects, this is still a very enjoyable beer. I wish they served this at our KW Oktoberfest instead of the usual MacroMania.

2229,"2008-09-22",2.8,"The rich, woody amber liquid raises a small, finely-beaded snowy froth. A saturating nutty/toasty  “barley mash” nose erupts from the glass, and decadent notes of flowers, baking cookies, dark rum, and wet sycamore tree transform the aroma into something downright sensual. The flavor begins with rich nutty malt, rife with melanoidins (think fresh homebaked bread and searing meat)… and accentuates with pollen, pipe tobacco, charred wood and appleskin. The finish features warm bitterness and a surprisingly sharp flash of alcohol. Almost light in body, a fullish- almost greasy- texture contributes friction. This beer crumbles in the aftertaste, which somewhat echoes the flavor but ends with a lingering alkaline, fishy quality that completely ruins the whole experience. Overall, very promising to start with, but “wonky” and disappointingly far less smooth than expected.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"

There is strong caramel and toffee in the aroma, due in large to the Munich malt,  as well as surprisingly fruity notes of cherries and honey, leaving this brew feeling heavily toasted and appetizing.  The body is firm, yet smoothly subtle with slight smoke, overripe fruit, and dark burnt malt overtones.  Delicious and easy to drink all day long, this is a wonderful ruby/amber lager with which to celebrate good times- whether it be the largest beer festival in the world or a backyard beer tasting.

From the bottle into my glass, she pours a bright golden brown with a creamy, foamy head which lingers around the rim of the glass long after. Caramel and bready malt in the nose, maybe a bit of apple. I can def taste the faint hint of apple that I got in the nose, along with smooth mild malt sweetness. I get a lingering bit of hop bite on the top back of the tongue after each swallow. As the Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest warms a bit, I get more of the bready mouth feel mixed in with the apple and caramel. Watching tiny bubbles swim to the top of my glass, I find myself transported to Germany, sitting at a long table, throwing back my beer, and watching the festivities with a silly grin on my face.

Taste outdoes the malt complexity in the nose: has a lot of bread and base (munich/vienna) malt with a lovely honeyed note balanced with a nicely restrained hop bitterness and mild flavor.

Hacker-Pschorrs Oktoberfest poured a very light copper. This is one of the clearest beers I have ever seen. 1 finger micro bubble head that took a little time to dissolve. What make this beer look good Is how clear it is.

The smell is malty and sweet.Thats about all Im getting from it. It has a pretty weak nose on it.

The taste is alright Its a little lacking as well but theres bready qualities followed by just a touch of sweetness and it seems like a little fruit. Theres a bitterness at the end that is coming from roasted malt.

The mouthfeel is good. Its medium bodied with that chalky texture. One of the better aspects of this brew.

Drinkability is a little above average but nothing special. Its a beer you could drink a lot of considering the texture and mouthfeel but when you bring the taste and smell into it would you really want to?

In comparison to other Ofests, it was thin, with too lively of a carbonation, and not enough rich malt, toasty flavor.  Not bad, but nothing compared to the flagship of Ofests, Paulaner.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

It had no sourness: just a rich malt, leaving a very pleasant aftertaste.  The texture was smooth and rich.  There wasnt really much to this beer, it was fairly simple, but well done.

2229,"2006-01-27",5.0,"Hacker-Pschorr Original Oktoberfest pours to a beautiful, deep amber color with a thick and creamy white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic, it is just loaded with toasty/nutty malt aroma. The palate is as wonderful with lots of big, hearty, nutty/toasty malt flavors on a clean and round body. HP Ofest finishes with more of those fantastic nutty/toasty malt flavors, and ends with a touch of dry herbal bitterness to round out those great malt flavors. 

Perfection. It is hard to improve on a tried and true orignal marzen/Oktoberfestbier, and it is why I love the imported German examples so much. Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest just might be the bench mark example of what marzen, as a style, is all about. This beer is the perfect match with spit roasted pork, BBQ, steaks, stews, or any hearty Fall/Winter dish.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

2229,"2005-12-28",3.5,"(500 ml bottle: $2.49 at Bottleworks in Seattle, WA) Its been a long time coming.  Seven years since I last saw this beer on shelves, and I had to drive to Seattle to find it!  The date printed on the bottle label is 06.05, so I presume that means its six months old.  This is one of my favorite imported Oktoberfests, proudly and prominently putting on display the luscious, up front German malty character that I just cant seem to find in any domestic release.  Its a bit more caramely and earthier than I remember, possibly due to the moderate aging.  The moderate hop bitterness lends perfect balance, complementing the moderately sweet malts from sip to finish.  Fairly dry maltiness in the nose, not much hoppiness, but a bit too earthy.  Body is medium with nice carbonation and a fairly smooth palate.  Could stand to be a bit cleaner and crisper though.  I have the glass of beer on a small shelf on my desk, with a lamp off to the side, and this beer is nearly textbook in appearance.  It is medium amber in color, shows a stunning clarity, and a dozen or so streams of very tiny carbonation bubbles crawl at a snails pace toward the surface.  The head is ivory in color, but doesnt show particularly impressive retention, rising to nearly an inch in height, but then settling to a filmy layer with five minutes or so.  And theres no lacing on the glass.  Some of the domestic Oktoberfest releases are tasty in their own right, but they are Americanized versions.  When I pick up an Oktoberfest, I prefer the classic German flavor on display here.  Id probably prefer the draft version in Germany, but Ive not been afforded that luxury yet.  Can only imagine, and dream...","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

A clear orange-bodied brew with a creamy, splotchy-tan head that turned chunky before dissipating. Malted aroma was bready with caramel, and the flavor was rather bittersweet... ending on the sweet side. A small hint of spiciness in the finish, but tasted like a typical dunkel.

Some lingering malt in the aftertaste...not so dry but definitely carbonated. Not as syrupy as other marzens i have tried, so that was definitely a plus.

Starts out mildly malty, an even earthy malt arising from the barley.  The middle of the body dries out some and there is some hops flavor here.  Little acidity throughout.  The body is medium and to my delight, this beer is not watery. Alcohol adds some warm light caramel flavor late and the beer finishes with a clean crisp nutty hops flavor.  I will admit the flavor does thin out somewhat towards the finish, but I enjoy the unique flavors created by the dry hops and barley mixed with a warm alcohol/caramel flavor.  Again, if it is this good in the bottle in America, this must be incredible in Germany on tap. I can only dream and wait patiently.

2229,"2003-09-03",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2005 Sept, 2003 Deeply malty aroma. Its right down there at the bottom of the barrel, all sticky and gooey and black and dripping and throbbing with gristle and cracked sinews and the sweat from a builders arse. It pulsates with the sexual energy of a randy gorilla on viagra. This malt has got hairy balls and the libido of a Ferrari. Its a kick-ass, crome-plated, fuel-injected, world-champion deep diving, chest-thumping, ever-loving shaguar of a malt aroma. And all rather spoiled by the metallic hops the Germans seem to love so much. Ah well. The taste is good - a creamy caramel in a body that just tiptoes teetering on the brink under the wire of decent for just enough time for the watery finish to really piss you off. The sweet malt returns nicely in the finish - not with any great range of flavours, but just there as a sweet malt should be - kinda cute, kinda simple, hair all nicely curled and with an innocent smile. The earthy hops come in a little stronger (theyve been there all the time, hovering decently above it all, not intrusive, just letting you know that the sweet malt is not going to have it all its way) - and when those hops come in late theres just a moment of cringing. How much youll like this will depend on how much you like those earthy but metallic hops, and how much you like your malt to play a simple sweet game. I liked it. I didnt think it was a GREAT beer, but it was tasty enough. [3.3]

The spurt of maltiness, accompanied by a tinge of metallic bitterness and palate-jarring acidity, doesnt add much to an otherwise plain-jane lager aroma.

This did have a nice toffeeish flavor though - with slight toasted and burnt caramel notes.  Excellent dark amber color and noticeable alcohol warming, which is borderline detracting from drinkability.  Primary drawback is a slightly heavy palate.

2229,"2001-09-03",5.0,"perfect beer. I could say this is in the top 5 best beers I have ever tastedin my life","Garwood, New Jersey, USA","buffdaddy615999"
2229,"2001-09-03",2.3,"H-P is probably the most consistently disappointing brewery.  Their products look nice and I always anticipate a good beer, but I have yet to try a brew of theirs I would consider better than good.  Dominated by yeast with fleeting fruitiness, this is another let-down.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
2229,"2001-09-03",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2003 A great 5 star beer from my most favorite hp brewery. They really know how to make a beer and deservedly so, they have been doing it for hundreds of years. A classic beer. Tastes perfect.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
2229,"2001-08-09",3.5,"I dont like this here and I dont even think you can get it over there.  Too sweet.","Passaic, New Jersey, USA","SNIAT"
2229,"2001-06-24",3.9,"A very nice beer, finishes off quite well. Great on a fall evening. I buy one case a year as an Oktoberfest present to myself.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
2229,"2001-06-15",4.3,"Probably the pick of the brews at the Weißn. While many of the others have stooped to serving colored Helles, I was able to enjoy this very nice Märzen at the Oktoberfest.","New York, USA","lovibond"
2229,"2001-05-25",2.7,"Middle of the road Marzen.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
2229,"2001-05-13",2.9,"There is a yeasty taste that does not appeal to me in this Marzen that I have never tasted before...but otherwise an enjoyable brew for eating a good meal of steak","Wisconsin, USA","Got Stout?"
2229,"2001-05-09",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2008 Re rated 12/2008 - Poured from bottle.  Real nice roasty malt aroma.  Mahogany, thin head.  Malt flavors taste almost burnt, but very good.  Hops add a refreshing dry feel to the beer.   Caramel notes as well.  Finshed well.   Thumbs up.","York, SC via NJ, South Carolina, USA","HighlanderOne"
2229,"2001-05-09",3.9,"Pretty tasty brew.  Nice malt flavor, enjoyable.  One of the better Oktoberfest-Marzen beers Ive had.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
2229,"2001-02-05",4.0,"I had it served in its own special glass and it was very good. Relatively smooth, it went down without any trouble. Definitely worth trying again.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Strange Brew"
2229,"2000-11-29",2.4,"I drank this in the month of the best before date so perhaps it had gone off.","St. Johns, Newfoundland, CANADA","shorlin"
2229,"2000-10-27",3.8,"A world class Oktoberfest-Marzen. Beautiful Hallertauer hop aroma with a carmelly malt nose interplays with each other. A smooth texture on first sip with a rich toasted malt flavor and just the right amount of hop bitterness. The amber/orange color makes it even more appetizing for a fall day.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
