1878,"2017-05-12",3.8,"Aroma is malts/pale malts and German lager yeast. The flavor is pale malts, mild fruit, German yeast and a smooth/slightly tart finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1878,"2017-05-07",2.9,"Can (BB Oct 2017). Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain, husks), trace hops (herbs), with a note of metal. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively/soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Not much going on in the nose, and theres some huskiness and metal to spoil the malt. Decent flavor balance for the style, but again brought down by raspy straw-like huskiness. Meh.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1878,"2017-04-26",2.0,"Bottle 33 cl. Hazy golden with a white head. Aroma is clearly light struck - and dominated by that alone. Medium body, malty, boozy with a solid bitter finish. Pity with the skunk. 260417","","CloakedDagger"

Taste is sweet malts, grains and grass. Bitter and honey-sweet finish. Strong carbonation. Some alcoholic warmth. Nice mouthfeel. Probably the most balanced of the Einbecker pale Bocks. Dangerously drinkable. Well done.","North Rhine-Westphalia, GERMANY","Grumpelmies"

1878,"2017-03-24",3.9,"Komm, gib mir deine bier. 330 ml bottle. Pours a honey gold color topped by a small dense frothy head. Big grainy malt nose hints at fresh sauerkraut. Subtle, sweet grainy malt flavor has notes of hay, lemon, toast and grassy hops. Some warming alcohol notes in midtaste. Finish is honey malt with some citrus hops. A very nice pale bock.

1878,"2017-03-20",3.5,"Green glass, 11.2 oz bottle. Touch of skunk and grainy pils right out of the neck, but hey, thats green imported aromatics for you; this one lasts a bit, though. Also sweet with a little white grape. Pour a gorgeous clear golden-orange, very rich and saturated and burning; large head is creamy bright white. Taste grainy pils with white grape, sugar, and lots of honey; sweetness doesnt domineer and theres a rich maltiness taking over midway through. Full body but not fat, just full and satisfying, with low but firm hop bitterness that lasts and very mild herbal-hoppy spice. Little flits of lemon and orange with cream, resembling a gentler cousin of Hefeweizen.  Clean with no astringency or sickly character, also not sticky,  close to refreshing save for the weight of the alcohol (though no burn). Surprised at how good this is despite even its mistreatment.

1878,"2017-03-09",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2017 (330 ml Bottle) A hazy, deep golden beer, with a small white head that quickly disappears. A warm waft of alcohol hits the nose first, then metallic notes, fresh corn, and orange citrus fruit. The mouth-feel is creamy and almost syrupy. The beers overriding sweetness hits the palate first, with caramel, banana and clove. The smooth carbonation carries orange and citrus aromas forward, before a mildy alcoholic end. The aftertaste is bitter and minerally, with subtle earthiness and sour, resinous undertones. Swallowing the beer leaves a warm, sticky clog in the mouth and throat, and a heavy stomach.","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","victorsampson96"

1878,"2017-02-03",3.4,"33cl green embossed bottle. Pours insanely hazed for the style, like a very hazy zwickel, small white head. Aroma is lemon-lime, crayon/wax, savory herb. Smells pasteurized, but maybe it isnt :////. Flavor is decent, very floral and fruity toffee, definite hop bitterness and herb character. This is a pretty fresh import, but I also would like to try this fresh form the source, because this isnt screaming top 50 for me.

1878,"2016-12-06",3.5,"33cl bb11/2016, merci idiosynkrasie for this unexpected gem from a long written-off traditional brewer. - Bref: unfiltered Keller-Bock manages to steer clear of wallpaper glue starches, adding back in tasty protein and mineral structure to just-rightly squeezed aka decocted pale malts. - Unlike their normal Heller Bock, since long in decline, the glue starches are dialed down and tied back into a still clean, but more colourful lager that lets more malt nuances speak for its amped abv that the original starch sniffer. - Honey as a bière de garde matter-of-factness to the barley malts, damp wallpaper only hovering over that before the herbal hop character (nettle, herbal tea, white flower), yeast and unfiltered goodness are tied back in. Quite bitter, not typically malt-paste sweet. Yay for 2016, the year when more German traditional breweries started rediscovering the charms of unfiltered.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Unfiltered draft, served up at Laschets Inn during a Spring thunderstorm.
Murky orange with an ample head and chunky lacing.

Aroma is rich and yeasty, ultra pure. Biscuity and crisp, perfectly balanced.
Taste is immaculate and pristine, grassy hop and biscuity malt in perfect harmony, vague melon/cantaloupe note. Creamy smooth feel, voluptuous body, exceptionally smooth. Malty biscuity sweetness, finishes dry. Drank no less than three of these.

Nothing beats a fresh unfiltered German lager in the springtime. 
We were told this was the unfiltered Einbecker Heller-Bock, and the handle said ""1378"", with ""Ainpöckisch Bier"" in tiny lettering. 

Second time around, slight twanginess was present (drank 3 more).
