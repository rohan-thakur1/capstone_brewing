1500,"2017-01-23",3.9,"Éjfekete testén csak néhol hatol át némi fény, bézs színű habja krémesnek, ragadósnak tűnik. Mandulás, marcipános, meggymagos, túlérett cseresznyés illatai a legjobb főzetek velejárói, melyhez egy alkoholban ázott fahordó dongáinak aromája társul, így aztán jobbat már csak kötözködve kívánhatnánk az illatok terén. Konyakmeggyes, rumos csokoládés, bonbonos kortyok következnek ezután, a kávés, kakaós, vaníliás jegyek a marcipános desszertszerűséggel kiegészülve így tökéletes imperial porter benyomását keltik. Ami akár igaz is lenne, ha a szerkezetet nem találnánk egy egészen kicsit szellősnek, legalábbis ilyen összetevőkhöz mérten.
