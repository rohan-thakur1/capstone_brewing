Viscous and creamy with a chewy edge that reminds you of its strength but in a good way. There is a peat smokiness but also caramel, coffee, raisins and some dark fruit: maybe plums? Certainly a well concocted beer that retains its complex balancing act through to the bitter-sweet red fruit and currant finish.

Clarity seems to be high, though I didnt really test it.Light tobacco and leather in the nose gives way to dark chocolate and plentiful, sweet caramel notes. Vanilla is soft and there does seem to be a hint of citrusy hop aroma which is at odds with the chocolate and caramel. Very muted and understated overall. Couldnt discern the smoked portion from the nose. No alcohol noted.Sweet, not cloyingly so, though with a blend of vanilla notes, milk chocolate and dry graham cracker-like grains that attempt to balance. On the far end, the smoke is noted; light tobacco and leather with no bacon or any heavy smokiness. Texture is malty and comforting, with a moderately sweet finish, growing sweeter as it warms. The citrus from the hops comes off lightly oily and with the acids not complementing the milk chocolate and caramel flavors.

Aroma of dark chocolate and cocoa, surrounded by fruity notes of prunes and raisins with a bit of lovage as well. Sweetish taste of dark chocolate and cocoa, fruity notes as mentioned, followed by a relatively long, slightly bitter, earthy finish of coffee. Not sure where the smoked malts have gone. Medium body, smooth and oily mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Besides the weird aroma of lovage, this is a very decent and tasty beer. Rich fruity notes pair well with the dark chocolate flavour.

3107,"2015-01-25",4.0,"330 ml. bottle @ home. Obtained from Dranken Geers. Batch 251. BBF 22/07/2017. Impeccable & gorgeous label design as usual from these guys. I really like their labels. Very dark brown to black, little in the way of mocha head. Nose is thick soy sauce, light sweetness & faint liquorish but mainly just soy sauce. Taste is liquorish, soy sauce, umami, teriyaki sauce, brown sugar sweetness underneath, liquorish & dark forest fruits, there is faint roast in the back. For something with this much oily soy sauce flavours in it, it works pretty well mainly because they are balanced by the dark forest fruits notes + a good deal of sweetness. Faintly vinous in the back when close to room temperature. Very oily & low carbonation. Surprisingly enjoyable oddly but this isnt what I was hoping for when I picked up this one & saw the mentions of Germany + smoked beers.

Smak: lekka słodycz z kwaskową kontrą i wyczuwalnymi na wstępie nutami owocowymi. Następnie czekolada gorzka i mleczna, kawa, melanoidyny, lekka wędzonka. Alkohol wyczuwalny, aczkolwiek dość dobrze zamaskowany. 

Goryczka i odczucie w ustach: maksymalnie umiarkowana goryczka (słodowo- alkoholowo- chmielowa), raczej delikatna i niezbyt długa. Krągła pełnia, niskie do umiarkowanego wysycenie i jedynie lekka alkoholowa końcówka. Finisz raczej wytrawny alkoholowo- palony. 

Kolejny ciekawy wynalazek z BrewDoga, będący efektem kolaboracji z amerykańskim browarem Victory. Jest to Porter Bałtycki połączony z wędzonym. Piłem go uprzednio w wersji beczkowej i wydał mi się wówczas o wiele bardziej interesujący, a co ważniejsze intensywny w aromacie i smaku. W wersji butelkowej także nie jest źle, choć barwa wydaje się odrobinę zbyt ciemna, a piana niebyt trwała. W aromacie i smaku jest przyjemnie, jednak miałem nadzieję na więcej nut wędzonych. Na plus dobrze ukryty alkohol, bowiem mimo dość wysokiego poziomu nie poraża. Jak na BrewDoga całkiem ułożone i stonowane piwo.

3107,"2014-08-13",3.3,"Bottle from BottleDog London and drunk at home. Black beer lasting tan head. Some light smoke. Some roasted malt, some burnt toast on finish, some hop. Like Ken says, its a little disappointing for such a big beer from 2 good collab breweries. Decent but nothing too special. Perhaps my palate is jaded these days. Some coffee. As I say the smoke is very light and more ashtray than full on Bamberg smoked meat or cheese. OK.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
