2640,"2015-08-30",3.2,"Bottled, from Biershop Baden-Württemberg.  Clear pale golden, small head. Rich banana aroma. Mid sweet with medium body and rounded mouthfeel. Biscuity malt, ripe banana. Low bitterness. Quite flavourful for a kristallweizen.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2640,"2014-09-05",3.1,"500 ml bottle. BB 15/09/14. Vielen Dank Timo A! 
Clear yellow golden colour with a tiny white head.
Sweetness, toffee, yeast, mild wheat and mild bitterness in the aroma. 
The flavour is grainy malt, wheat and mild sweetness. Surprisingly nice for a Kristallweizen.

2640,"2014-07-30",2.4,"Bottle. Light golden, small to average and mostly diminishing head. Light to moderate, malty  some wheat and lightly sweetish aroma, light banana and fruitiness. Body is light to medium, malty  lightly wheaty and lightly sweetish flavor, light banana. Finish is short, malty  faintly wheaty and lightly sweetish, faint banana and light cardboard. Watery, no good weisse. Lacks character.","Helsinki, FINLAND","mile"
