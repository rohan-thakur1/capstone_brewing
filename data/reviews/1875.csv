1875,"2015-04-16",3.5,"Very rich caramel coloured body with a thinnish, half centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of biscuits, caramel malt, alcohol, toffee and quite a bit of bread - pungent. Full-bodied; Strong biscuit flavour with a good deal of caramel malt and actual caramelised sugars, some fruit tastes, hints of caster sugar and a good rich malt note coupled with some sugars and a good deal of yeast. Aftertaste shows a complex finish with the malt front and center, but a good hop kick and a lot of sugar, but a good profile for a lager, especially from a bigger craft brewery. Overall, a nice beer and not a bad option should they package this beer in any other container than a huge case purchase. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle from Costco in Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia on 17-October-2014 for US$30,99 for 24 pack, sampled at home in Washington on 15-April-2015 a few blocks away.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
1875,"2015-02-14",3.6,"Solid if slightly boring Helles Bock, the hoppiness didnt come through too much and it was definitely malt-dominated but not really sweet. Medium heaviness on the palate.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

1875,"2014-10-29",3.3,"Bottle from craft. Nice notes of bread, caramel malt, honey and pepper. It was really refreshing and the hop presence gave it a nice dry / oily finish.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","MadIndian"

1875,"2014-10-19",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2016 12 oz bottle into a pint glass,; revised  Jan. 2016 with another 12 oz bottle that was markedly better.  Compromise ratings. 

Looks great, with excellent clarity in the deep amber body and excellent retention of the off-white head. 

Aroma: sweet malts. ""overly grassy hops and a hint of soap"" noted in 1st review but absent in 2nd. 

Flavor: a solid malt base with toffee and biscuit notes accompanied by some light spicy hop that lead to mild bitterness by the finish. Slightly boozy.  The finish also has biscuit and light honey.

O: full, smooth mouthfeel with no alcohol harshness set this above others of this style on this dimension.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
1875,"2014-10-18",3.3,"Clear bright copper like a shiny penny, with a thin light beige cap. Calm semisweet cracker and biscuity nose. Not much there. Nice clean and semi light flavor of biscuity lager yeast and a blonde grainy cracker. Pretty standard for a helles. But in a good way. Its an easy style to screw up, and this aint screwed up.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

1875,"2014-09-08",3.6,"12oz bottle. Filtered copper-bronze body. This is quite a nice Heller Bock. Clean and very drinkable for the ABV. Very pleasant smooth malty tones...what I think of as a golden malt river, edged of sweet caramel. The aroma leaves a little to be desired, but overall this is a great Heller Bock. Fresh and easy, massive lager tones.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
