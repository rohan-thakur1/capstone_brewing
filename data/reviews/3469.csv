3469,"2017-03-23",4.6,"750 ml bottle via trade. Bottle 316/600. Pours a deep, dark, opaque brown - near black - with an inch or so of dark tan head that settles into a thick ring and thinner head while leaving some scattered ropes and spots of lace in the glass. I was worried about this one, a coffee beer that wasnt fresh when I got it, but man, was I wrong. Its phenomenal. Layers of coffee and chocolate and vanilla burst from the glass. Brown sugar, charred oak, whiskey, roasted malts, molasses, bakers chocolate, a hint of dark fruit, molasses, and toasted coconut. Medium-full bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth, coating mouthfeel thats altogether sweet, boozy, roasty, and rich. It hits you fast; at first, I thought it was a bit much on the palate, but then it ebbs out in the most satisfying way, leaving some sweetness and lingering whiskey and roast - and everything else, just muted - behind. If you still have one, Id drink it now. I dont think its going to get any better.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3469,"2016-12-30",4.4,"Shared at Matthews beautiful home with great company.

Dark brown body with a bubbly, oily beige collar. The aroma leads with dark roast coffee beans followed by scents of oak, bourbon. Vanilla character emerges mid to late palate. Coffee is the star of this show and the most prominent flavor component. The finish offers a gentle alcoholic warmth with charred coffee grounds and a mild sweetness imparted from the barrel. Delicious.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
3469,"2016-12-30",4.1,"Thanks Huhzubendah for sharing the bottle! Poured into a snifter showing pitch black with a quickly dissipating latte colored foam. 

The nose shows very strong bourbon with an equally strong supporting vanilla background. 

The palate is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Strong vanilla forwardness with an equal alcoholic spice. Bourbon on the mid palate - a lot of charred wood. Coffee on the finish showing a toasted bitterness and resurgence of sweet vanilla on the aftertaste.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
3469,"2016-10-19",4.2,"From notes. Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Traviss house on September 24. 750 mL bottle (bottle number not noted) shared by Doug. The pour on this baby is black as night, thick and nice with a thin ring of light brown head and no lace as you let if disappear. The aroma is really hot and boozy up front. Jesus. There is a lot of vanilla and a good coffee, but the alcohol is pretty heavy. There is a light roast and some light chocolate on the back end, but for the most part, its coffee, light vanilla, and bourbon. The flavor is much of the same. The barrel, bourbon, and coffee are all pretty heavy. The vanilla and a light chocolate really come through nicely, before the bourbon controls the back end. The mouth feel is thinner and lighter than I would expect. The carbonation is soft and the aftertaste is lingeringly bourbon and coffee with a hint of vanilla. Really good, but its really hot.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3469,"2016-08-24",4.8,"An excellent beer, but I dont see all the extra craftsmanship and rarity coming through in the flavor much. But its still really goddamn great.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
3469,"2016-06-07",4.1,"750mL shared at Woodshop 10. Ink pour with thin reddish foam. Boozy nose, nicer bourbon, not much coffee. Softer body, spicy chocolate, warming alcohol, spicy oak, solid coffee there for much-needed bitterness and balance. Silky, soft palate. Hints of savoriness peek through. Yummy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3469,"2016-01-12",4.1,"Bottle @ Home. Thanks again, Jake! Black in color with a finger of tan foam. Intense coffee aroma here. Hints of coconut, toasted nuts, and lots of fresh roasted coffee beans. Slight blueberry, licorice, and definitely a strong dose of cocoa. Has a touch more bitterness than some other barrel aged Speedways, but I like it for that reason. Pungent and fresh coffee. Light sweetness of vanilla and hazelnut. Well done.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3469,"2016-01-05",4.7,"Bottle @ Dangerous Bottleshare ft. Lukasmh and Daawi thanks to Lukasmh and Bursprak. Thanks guys! Pours pitch black with a medium brown head. Aromas of lots of barrel, vanilla, dark chocolate, chocolate icecream, fudge, coconut, roasted coffee. Wow. The aroma of this is awesome. Taste has a big massive roasty coffee in the front, huge barrel notes, vanilla, fudge, coconut, molasses, rich dark chocolate, oaky sweet notes. God damn.","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"
3469,"2015-12-28",4.6,"Rating #1800 Bottle @ Dangerous Bottleshare featuring Lukas and Aaron. Pours black with a brown head. Aroma of chocolate cake, some muffin dough, sweet bourbon, vanilla, vanilla ice cream, dark chocolate, fresh ground coffee, slight coconut and some molasses. Straight up amazing smell. The taste is very bourbon forward like you would expect with all the sweet components of the aroma pulling all the good stuff out of those barrels. It adds a bit of roast though and is also more barrel-heavy than you would expect from the aroma. This is an awesome sipper indeed.","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"
3469,"2015-12-26",3.9,"Bottle #245. Dark brown pour with a light brown head. Sweet mocha aromas. Sweet with mocha, brown sugar, oak, vanilla, and smooth bourbon notes. A little thinner in the body than traditional Speedway. Good mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"

Pours a pitch black with a lovely, everlasting, brown, creamy head. Aroma has (guess what) bourbon, vanilla, lactose, chocolate ice cream, milk chocolate, vanilla ice cream, coconut, molasses, lots of sweetness, but also some coffee, brown sugar, Mathilde Chocolate Milkshake!! Taste is oh darn sweet in the really good way! Loots of vanilla, bourbon, booze, raisins, slight spice, slight roasty coffee. Late after taste leaves you heavily in doubt wether you just had beer or bourbon. Lovely! Medium low carbonation and a thick, smooth body. Holy crap this is good!","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"
3469,"2015-12-05",3.9,"Bottle 257/600. The pour is black with a tan head. The aroma is vanilla and bourbon big time. The taste is a little harsh on the bourbon.

3469,"2015-11-02",3.9,"big thanks to Dakine for bringing this. Tons and tons of vanilla. Overwhelming vanilla. Base is delicious coffee and roast. Its difficult to tell if the roast is coming from the coffee or the roasted malts. Finish is vanilla sweet.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3469,"2015-10-08",4.3,"Thanks, FlopFaceFred. The beer is black with a smallish mocha brown head. A little bit of lacing. Sweet vanilla goodness in the aroma. Lots of coffee. Very mild roast. Molasses and brown sugar. Nice bourbon barrel contribution. Its all nice sweet flavors that play together well. Taste is a little acidic. I think Id love this beer without the barrel aging. The barrel flavors are nice but the vanilla is a bit blunted and the coffee is a little harsh in combination with the oak and bourbon. Medium body. Light cream.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Pours jet black color with a small beige head. Bourbon aroma with vanilla sweetness, roasty dark malts, espresso notes, dark chocolate, some hops and subtle wood. Creamy smooth and thick palate at first, loaded with cocoa powder and chocolate on the flavor, bourbon-y vanilla sweetness, bitter dark malts leading to a coffee-roasty wooden finish. Lasting chocolaty aftertaste. Complex yet beautifully balanced slow sipper. Leaves a somewhat sticky creamy layer in your mouth.

3469,"2015-08-30",4.3,"750 ml bottle. Bottle 466/600. Enjoyed at San Diego, CA. Pours a black colour with a small beige thick head. Aroma of roastiness, vanilla, espresso, syrupy pancakes and bourbon. Rich flavour of big bold roastiness, wood, vanilla, dark chocolate, heavy bourbon sweetness, licorice and smooth coffee notes. Full bodied. Alcohol warms and grows towards the end. Really heavy. Give it some time and it will round up a bit more. Now the wooden notes are quite stinging. Excellent stuff anyways.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"
3469,"2015-08-30",4.2,"75 cl bottle @ hotel room, San Diego. Bottle 466/600. Aroma has bourbon tones, vanilla, cocoa and licorice. Feels rather sweet. Flavour has alcohol, licorice, bourbon, wood and vanilla. Rich and nice slow sipper, alcohol balances the sweetness here. A bit less alcohol and this could be even better.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
3469,"2015-08-29",4.7,"on tap at the observation room - more complexity than the BBA Speedway head to head. Sweeter, and initially hotter, but opens up really well. The Blue Mountain coffee is covered up more than Id like by the barrel and rye/vanilla concoction, but I cant complain. Head to as good as or better than BBA Speedway, which has always been a favorite. A great complex sipper - not quite worth the hype only because no beer is worth THAT much hype, but it was damn good, and takes its place high in the Speedway family of awesomeness. If the coffee was more pronounced, and the barrel a touch less (really nitpicking) itd be perfect, or really really close to it.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3469,"2015-08-29",4.2,"Bottle courtesy of FlopFaceFred. 
Aroma is full of dark chocolate and coffee with some lighter vanilla character. Nice coffee notes with some light nuttiness and fruitiness. Some light roast notes. Good dark chocolate with some medium light bourbon notes. 
Pours black, but not quite motor oil with a medium sized, moderately thick, dark mocha head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers. Light lacing and moderate legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with some nice chocolate notes. A lot more vanilla than in the flavor which works really well with the sweet chocolate notes. Light roast character. Nice coffee notes with some light nuttiness. Moderate bourbon character with light alcohol spice. Moderate bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium full to full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a very nice Speedway, but I prefer the Vietnamese ones more. Good coffee and bourbon character and I like that vanilla isnt chemically and doesnt dominate.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3469,"2015-08-18",4.6,"Bottle shared by my brother. looks dark black with some brown fine bubble foam. nose is coffee, toasted marshmallows, and a back end blending of boozy fine bourbon barrel and vanilla. Mouthfeel is about as good as you can get with a bourbon barreled beer, velvet is the right name. Sitting with this beer and letting it open up really opens this one up. A marbling of whiskey/bourbon with spots of pronounced barrel and vanilla. The coffee is the canvas for all the other flavors. For what its worth, as someone with no more bottles-- I thought it was even better than reg BA speedway, which is unusual for me as I tend not to like beers with higher quality bourbon barrels.","Palm Desert, California, USA","cavery"
3469,"2015-07-25",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2015 1st Rating. On draft at Urge Gastropub. Pitch black pour, oily, with a dark brown head which dissipates to nothing. Aroma of whiskey, brownie, espresso, roast, and dark chocolate. Strong whiskey flavor, dark roasted malt, espresso, bitter dark chocolate, and slight notes of vanilla. The whiskey is pretty strong here, fairly boozy.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
