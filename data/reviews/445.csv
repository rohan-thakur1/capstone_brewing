445,"2016-01-25",3.4,"180 ml pull-tab bottle with pull-tab bought at Esso Tiger Mart in Transport Plaza, Yuen Long.
[Preparation: Bottle stored, opened and served at room temperature (10°C) as suggested on the label.]
Clear, near colourless with very pale yellowish hue; Fragrant aroma of rice wine, with boiled glutinous rice, strong pollen, strong floral, pear ester, strong alcohol and strong sugar; Medium sweet taste of rich rice spirit, with strong tartness, very strong warming alcohol, pears flesh, bitter melon, sugar, liquorices and strong tannin; Close to light body. Thick and oily palate; Mouth feel is fairly dry and strong rice wine. The 5% blend of Ginjo Koshu contributes much of its fiery characters  very oily feel and bombastic warming alcohol, yet not razor sharp and quite easy to embrace. The honjozo itself is very tart, sugary with fairly good esters. Strong astringency from liquorices and tannin with bitter melon taste. Good!... Fairly dry after taste; Warming and strong sweet-bitter to mouth.

Comments: The Koshu factor really drive this one to a different level, with tasty hard-hitting booze and hard sweetness mixed well with strong tartness and dryness. Woul have been mistaken as a straight Genshu, this fusion sake wirks out just fine - in small amount. A yes!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

445,"2009-11-04",3.7,"180 ml bottle. 
Fruity, caramel, milk, aroma, sweetish, a bit of oxidation from the koshu. Much more aging in the flavor, sweet, caramel and sherry. Funky too. Fruity, with raisins, milky. The taste is dominated by the koshu, though not overwhelming and with a regular sake palate, though quite creamy. Funky and interesting. A good introduction to koshu without the weirdness. That little 15% really kicks the flavor in, though. Cheap and tasty.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
