1759,"2017-04-23",3.5,"Bottle at the hotel in Tokyo - picked up at the Baird taproom in Yokohama. Pours clear orange-gold, effervescent, with a frothy pure white head. Lightly toasted biscuits in the aroma, some citrus peel, pale grains. Light sweet flavour with nips of pine needles, orange peel, hay. Light bodied with lively carbonation. Decent balance to the finish, with further biscuity malts, mellow citrus accents, lager malts, a little grassy bitterness, husky grains. Enjoyable lager.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1759,"2017-02-27",3.2,"Pours golden with a full, bubbly white head that settles slowly. There isnt to much of an aroma in here. Very mild grassy hops, orange, and crackers. Things do pick up in the taste. Its slightly bitter, with a good balance of grassy hops, cereal, bread, and orange. Some herbal hops come through mostly at the end into a mild and long aftertaste. This is light to medium in body, with a slick texture, and average in carbonation. For whatever reason, I found this quite refreshing and easy to drink. But there arent really any further highlights.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

1759,"2014-01-10",3.7,"360 ml bottle bought at YATA in Grand Century Place in Mong Kok.
Cloudy hazy amber brown colour with scappy brown yeast sediments; One finger head with off-white foam which lasts for 90 seconds; Moderate sticky lacing with notable small carbonation; Fragrant sweet aroma of full lager / caramel malt, with raisins, dark fruit, honey, light chocolate, caramel, yeast, light musty, and faint grass; Close to light sweet taste of roasted malt and ale malt, with light coffee, milk chocolate, faint caramel, Cola, dry biscuits, bread, yeast, liquorices, bitter lime and grassy hops; Mid to light body, slightly slick and crisp palate; Mouth feel is a hybrid of roasted lager and ale, very much in line with Vienna (think Sam Adams Boston Lager) with some chocolaty and coffee like roasty Amber character come through in a very restrained way. Sweetness is near zero, and its dry crisp biscuity as hell. Gooood Hoppiness is faint grass nose, sharp citrus and grass in taste. Notably astringent for a lasting and licking mid-bitter finish; Bone dry after taste, crisp and nicely bitter to mouth.

Comments: As Amber / Vienna, this one is already stand above most macros, and I like it more than Sam Adams Boston for its tight and pretty exciting taste combos. It has the best of both roasted malt beer and Ale, with the right amount of roastiness, damned good dryness, and sharp as knife hoppiness, it brings out the best of an otherwise ordinary beer style. A winner!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

An earthy mild spicy aroma that makes me think Saaz hops. Medium bodied, very well balanced but more malty than Tenjinguras Pilsner. Then again this is a lager so it shouldnt be a surprise.

1759,"2012-12-28",3.7,"Bottle. Im surprised at the style designation listed here as ""vienna""== to me, there is more character imparted from the hops and yeast than from the malt, and furthermore, I associated the maltiness of a vienna with caramel, bread crusts, etc. Anyhow, if this is an acceptable vienna, then my appreciation (and education) of viennas just took a big leap forward, because this is an excellent beer. Medium golden body, with a slight haze and a uniform, moderately dense 2 finger head. Lovely soft fruit aroma, melons and pears come to mind. Soft fruity palate with a nice bread malt sweetness and low bitterness. The flavours here are just so pleasant and the palate is nice and soft.

1759,"2011-04-15",3.8,"The appearance is slightly caramel and amber in color, with a rich and persistent rocky head. It looks good, but not like a lager.

The aroma is characterized by soft, rounded malts and a very slight hint of lemony hops.

The taste is light, but with caramel and buttery hops being apparent. The hops taste a bit more like yuzu than I would have expected.

The mouthfeel is soft, with light and small bubbles.

Given that this beer had won a Gold Medal for lager style at the 2010 World Cup, I had high expectations. All in all, it was pretty good but not completely spectacular. That being said, I can still enjoy a number of these.","JAPAN","OneBrewru"

NIce spice and soft citrus with hints of herbal and pine - more of a pine feel Id guess, caramel, mild to medium bitterness and hey, I just got that classic vienna malt taste - it snuck in on the end of a sip over half the way into the bottle. Good body, plenty of rich malts and a mild spice that kept my taste buds alert. Me likey. On the very end of the aftertaste there is the vienna.

1759,"2007-07-26",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
Apricot fruitiness seeps from the discreet honeyed maltiness of this Vienna, as spicy, herbal hops balance out the back end. All is subtle and quenching.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the misty amber.
-The hop aroma is even minty at times.
-Nose and flavor profile are both a little too subdued.
-Drinkability is optimal and seems to be this beers main aim.
-Fruitiness also includes orange character.
