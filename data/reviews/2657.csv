To say I was looking forward to this one was an understatement. Not that I particularly thought each of the base beers were spectacular (my ratings were below with each - Wee Heavy (3.98) Speedway Stout (4.30) and Old Numbskull (3.80) - but blend those three in barrels? Oh yeah. As pathetic as it was, Reforged was my oldest aged beer at roughly 9-to-10 months That might be perfect for my aging situation though (a cabinet), maybe more like 12-to-13 months? Who knows? Lets review this already.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy, bubbly, tan head. Good, foamy retention. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled smooth bourbon up front, followed by vanilla, toffee, caramel, leathery, tobacco, oak, milk chocolate, dark candied shell and crayon. Got boozier as the smell went down, which is fairy unusual I think. For American Strong Ale, great on the nose. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste followed somewhat. Got leathery tobacco and raisins first, followed by a boozy warmth that seemed to go down from my throat to my stomach in no time. Also smooth bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee, oak, dark chocolate, some black coffee, milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, crayon and a touch of smoked cocoa nibs. In order, probably got Wee Heavy, Old Numbskull and then Speedway Stout. (Taste - 4.25)

Full-to-medium body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. Just a touch hot. Probably could have used another three months or so. (Feel - 4.25)

This got much better as it warmed and Im glad I waited until I poured a few glasses. Lovely. (Overall - 4.25)
