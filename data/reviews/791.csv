Head is initially large, creamy/frothy, off-white, fully lasting.

Couldnt really ask for a better appearance...big, dense, creamy head that lasts long and strong, on top of a hazy caramel body.  Toasty and phenolic nose is less banana-rich than the other offerings, but still quite nice.  More tartness (and less richly sweet, more watery/thin) than the regular weiss, but quite quaffable as a result.  Enjoyable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Again the ultra-foamy gutmann mouthfeel hits you with a blast of yeastiness, but muted, overtaken flavours. Barely tasting like toasted grains, its pistachio and plum ice cream hints are eaten up by the cloudy texture.
