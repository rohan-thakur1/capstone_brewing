2276,"2016-12-18",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2017 Update : après une Malheur 10 carrément éventée que jai du retester, jai décidé de revoir La Trappe Quadrupel après une dégustation désastreuse. Le nez est déjà différent : sur lalcool bien sûr, très liquoreux et hyper puissant, mais avec des arômes bien plus subtils : la pêche, labricot, la prune, la datte, de bons malts, la châtaigne, un fort côté résineux avec des grosses notes de pin, du cuir, un peu de banane, une levure droite... Il me manquera des notes florales et dagrumes pour vraiment avoir quelque chose moins brut de décoffrage. En bouche, la carbonatation est assez faible, lamertume légère, la texture très huileuse et lalcool vraiment (trop) puissant à mon goût qui déséquilibre lensemble. Un petit côté beurrée qui me fait dire que le stockage et/ou le transport de cet exemplaire nest toujours pas optimal, mais on est à des années lumières de la ""saloperie"" que jai pu boire auparavant. Une arrière-bouche sur les arachides (noix, cacahuète) est perceptible, très douce, très agréable et ajoute de la souplesse. La longueur est très bonne, sur lalcool, les saveurs de malts et ces fameux arachides. Il me manque toujours la note végétale pour bien faire. Mais ça reste une bonne Quadrupel qui ne viendra quand même pas titiller ce qui se fait de mieux dans le genre. Bouteille 33cl, V&B Grenoble.
Belle rousse/ambrée légèrement troublée avec sa mousse stable sur 1cm, bien blanche. Rien qui ne nous annonce la Bérézina à venir. Au nez, la banane, mais une banane chimique ! Limpression désagréable davoir ouvert une boite de bonbons acidulés, vous savez, ces bananes et bouteilles de cola acides à souhait quon bouffait étant gosses. Bref, un nez artificiel qui fait médicament et qui est limite écurant à la longue. Bon, tout nest pas jeter quand même : on sent tout de même des agrumes avec des notes de mandarines, pas bégueules, mais le tout est massacré par un alcool type Vodka qui prend le dessus immanquablement. En bouche, texture huileuse, carbonatation faible, toujours cette banane omniprésente et un alcool digne dune mauvaise liqueur. Alors une fois de plus, suis-je tombé sur une mauvaise bouteille ? En attendant, jai juste limpression davoir bu une bière de cuite pour punk à chien. Breuvage insignifiant et inutile. Bouteille 33cl, V&B Grenoble.","Grenoble, FRANCE","Zarrach76"

2276,"2016-10-16",5.0,"Pour cette dernière bière élaborée par labbaye Notre-Dame de Koningshoeven en 1991, les moines trappistes se sont laissés emportés par une véritable envolée lyrique! Cest une réelle chevauchée des Walkiries qui envahit le palais lors de cette dégustation. Notre pure sang est dun bel ambré, limpide, et surmonté dune splendide mousse blanc crème dun cm dépaisseur, onctueuse. Le nez est racé, la base se porte sur les céréales avec des notes citronées et de coriandre mais les arômes liquoreux viennent le renforcer et lui donner une belle consistance. A la dégustation, la galop est tout de suite donné. Lattaque, épicée, sur les céréales et le caramel est puissante voire imposante. Lamertume apparaît alors, dune intensité et corpulence exceptionnelle. Telles les notes dun opéra de Wagner envahssant lespace, les arômes surgissent et vous prennent le palais. Les arômes sont portés vers le cointreau, la girofle avec une présence de lalcool marquée, souhaitée, très bien maîtrisée et lui conférant un côté liquoreux (sans être pour autant de trop sucré). Le final, très long laisse une place un peu plus marquée aux épices. En conclusion, la Trappe Quadruple est une bière excptionnelle. Lintensité de ses arômes, sa longueur en bouche très longue et son côté liquoreux marqué en font une bière de dégustation mais qui par ses spécificités pourra déplaire à certains. Pour ma part, les moines auront réussi à élever ma spiritualité. Leur art, dune maîtrise sans faille, vaut allégrement la note maximale.","FRANCE","jybi"

I slept on this quad a little. I had it about 3 years ago, not thinking much about it, one way or the other, but this is exceptional in its subtlety. I would rate this slightly ahead of St. Bernardus abt 12, but just a hint behind the Rochefort quad. For the record I had a bomber dated B15 and side by side a regular size bottle dated K13.

2276,"2015-07-14",4.5,"In continuation with my All Things Belgian (That Dont Actually Come from Belgium) theme is Hollands La Trappe Quadrupel. This ale surprised me. Im used to having Quads that are decadent and big on grain sugars. La Trappes Quad is a new beast. Yes, its full and fruity, but with a balance that doesnt often show up in these warm and heavy beers. Body is brownish red and fairly lively. This brew doesnt keep a head like some of the unreasonably foamy Trappist ales, but the suds propel plenty of smells: champagne-like yeast, prune, plum, vinous and juicy grape, and rich malt. Flavor follows nose. You also get banana, toasted sugar, apple, and pear.Despite the sophisticated flavors, you wouldnt necessarily guess La Trappes Quad packs 10% ABV. While its got lots of class, this Quadrupel probably wont make you feel like youve been primed for hibernation.

26 march 2017. From Supeco. In plastic glass. At Maggies surprise birthday in Altamira 2. Smooth, with a notorious yet comfortable alcohol presence that doest break the general feel of balance.

2276,"2015-04-25",4.6,"Golden amber color and a coppery slightly cloudy tone that was poured in its beautiful owner bowl.
Beige Cream with a dense foam of height about a finger, good consistency, but quickly dissipates. Mark the walls of the Trappist glass with beautiful ties.
The Aroma is a sideshow. Salta nostrils bringing a sweet ripe banana tender, fowl in a burnt vanilla or sugar, or as a sweet beautiful walnut or perhaps a traditional brown glace Portuguese (made from nuts of course). Emerging shyly, but effectively could tell aromatic fans of a powerful dark malt drunk in caramel, dried fruit, raisins and fleshy plums.
Taste brings in your body in a lively carbonation a revolution in his mouth and carries a sweet bitterness dry kind of bittersweet. With dark malts and caramel brown or perhaps a caramel sugar, caffeine has a light in the background. It is indeed your great fruity flavor, slightly sweet but never cloying, which becomes very complex, yet it is incredibly easy to drink. A delicious Panettone and light woody touch not get out of my mind.
Certainly a Licorosa beer, velvety, leaving a finish of red fruit and a spicy light alcohol. Moreover, the powerful alcohol is present at the end of the sip and heat the throat or even the aftertaste. A happy cheating by hiding behind a much alcohol aroma and unique flavor.
A remarkable character of beer and unique flavor that goes down smooth and tenacious.

De afdronk is lang, zoet met tonen van banaan en aangenaam bitter van de hop.

I ordered a goblet of this after the sampler plate. The Quad was amazing. Aroma was somewhat sweet. Appearance was clear, amber, with white/tan head.

330ml bottle served in snifter at room temperature:

Pours a foggy mohagony showing no carbs and topped off by a huge creamy white head with a slight tan. Lacing properties are crazy making the brew very appealing visually.

The nose is outrageously fruity and nutty with tons of banana, molasses and almonds. I got a strong alcohol backbone giving a brandy aspect to the nose. Sometimes getting the alcohol in the nose is not a positive trait but in this case I found it fitted just right. Its almost as if you were about to drink a winter warmer so it makes the brew promessing.

On the tongue, the beer is dense, effervescent, putting out tons of candied fruits and nuts. It breaks down into foamy and sweet liquorish dattes leading to an incredible warm finish lasting ages.

This is just a wow all the way. I recommend any Quadrupel fan to give this beer a try. Its dense, complex and yet incredibly delicate. Awesome product! Cheers!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Beardbeerman"

First up is brown sugar followed by raisins and plums. Next is the licorice followed by a lingering herbal sweetness. The 10% ABV is not very noticeable. The beers tastes like it smells, which is refreshing. It pours a hazy dark tea amber under a 3"" rocky off-white foam cap that slowly dissipates into clingy clumps of finely bubbled foam. The beer lines the glass with lace and upon swirling shows a hint of legs. Smell of date and prune was almost immediate along with black plum and some light Damsen nippiness. Also a lot of brown sugar and apricot sweetness. As you drink there is also a deep boozy aroma that sneaks into the nostrils and detracts from the taste somewhat, ridiculously feather-light, almost to the point of having a flattened body... while you dont overtly taste the alcohol, it certainly thins out and helps float the beer across the palate.

Anywho, this is a pretty good Trappiste, full bodied and heavy with a big dose of dark fruit. I would say that the alcohol is more up front than in the better Trappistes, but this is a damn fine brew. Consumed in a nice (nicer than their beer!) Stella Artois glass.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"

Excellent quadrupel. The ABV isnt even close to hidden, but it works well with the dark fruitcake flavours on the nose and tongue. The body is definitely on the light side of medium, I think partly due to the moderate sustained carbonation, and partly due to the sharp edge of the alcohol on the tongue.

A: Beautiful amber-little-cloudy color. Really. However, filtered, I guess. Which, somehow, disappoints a bit. Good carbonation, as expected. It creates a big lacing and foamy head
S: Nice fruity smell: Dark fruits (prunes are evident). Fresh malts
T: Complex taste: Sweet candy (or toffee) is the first to be noted. Followed by dark Fruits. Bitterness and alcohol in the end

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a slightly darker amber color with a small half finger or less white head. The head fades very quickly leaving only a spotty level of lace on the side of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is biggest of a white grape smell mixed with a good deal of alcohol. This gives it a very white wine like smell overall. Unlike wine however, other subtle aromas of an earthy hop and some spicy smells of pepper and clove are mixed within giving it a slightly boozy and Belgian like wine smell overall.

 Taste  The taste begins mainly of a mix of a grapy and malty flavor initially. There are some flavors of an apple and cherry flavor mixed with these with the start of the taste, which seem to fade as the taste advances more to the middle and the end. Along with the dwindling of the cherry and apple, the breadiness of the beer lessens, producing a more dry and crisp flavor on the tongue. While all these flavors lose ground, the grapy flavor grows quite a bit stronger in taste and are joined by flavors of a more tanniny bitterness as well as flavors of alcohol. These flavors give the brew a more white wine like flavor which is combined with some flavor of a pepper and spicy nature as well as some earthy and pine hop tastes. In the end the combination of flavors produces a crisp spiced and hopped wine like flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The body of the brew is on the thinner side for a brew of 10 % abv with a carbonation level that is average to slightly above average. The body really suits the wine like flavors as well as the hop flavors nicely to produce a crisp champagne like feel, all the while keeping it a very drinkable brew even with all its alcohol and boozy tastes.

 Overall  A rather boozy and crisp quad with a whole lot of sparkling wine like characteristic. I was actually originally expecting something with more dark fruit flavors, so this was quite a surprise. It was rather interesting and nice and is certainly worth a try, although I think it is not really my thing ,and I think there are tastier quads out there.","","Darkmagus82"

2276,"2014-09-03",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2015 0.75 bottle. Slightly hazy, amber color with a strong reddish hue and a small, nearly-white head. A complex aroma archetypal to Belgian abbey brews including citruses, malts, spices, some weird-ass honey, bananas, quite strong notes of alcohol, some caramel, and dark fruits. Taste basically follows it with sweet maltiness, spices, fruits, synthetic honey, and citruses; alcohol strongly marks its presence - in this respect many other beers hide or adapt a high alcohol content thus producing a much tastier result, here it?s running wild. Full body, very creamy texture, and an average carbonation. Finish is milder, less intrusive, and more balanced - perhaps all of these qualities result from a more controlled alcohol presence, but nevertheless it works out quite well.

Taste is deep sweet, with a medium bitterness to balance. Not cloying at all despite the sweetness. Very smooth palate despite the high alcohol content. Full bodied, syrupy, medium carbonation.

2276,"2014-08-25",4.5,"330ml bottle bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen Long.
Preparation: bottle stored at refrigerator at around 4°C; Popped at room temperature at 12°C (within recommended temperature range) onto the Chimay chalice.

Looks: Cloudy hazy amber brown colour with thin trace of dirt- like yeast sediments; One finger head and crumpety off-white foam which lasts for 2 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with quite fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and sweet malt which can be smelt half a foot away, with strong fruity banana, silky vanilla, almonds (stronger as the beer warms), plums, light raisins, bubble gum, sugar, cream, light chocolate, very light alcohol, light Bel yeast and spices. Sweet and tempting!

Taste: Medium sweet amber malt, with strong plum, dark fruits, thick caramel, burnt toffee, banana flesh, strong molasses, light alcohol, spices, Bel yeast, lemon, strong bitter hops and sharp grass.

Body: Mid to light. Creamy and quite slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Moderately thick amber malt base with incredibly strong caramel which provide a base for layers of dark fruits, fruity banana, toffee and molasses for layers after layers of smooth, velvety sensation. Quite comfy and really entertaining!

Booze and Sweetness: The 10% abv is hidden most of the time, very well-managed, never screaming and blended in well with the complex tastes. The molasses is very strong but never cloying, seems to bring out the best in the phenolic spices. Great!

Hoppiness: Spicy aroma, with equally strong in lemon, hop cones and grass in taste, a standout against most Abts or Quads. Bitterness is sharp and quite potent, a good balance against the caramel and molasses for an abrupt, strong sweet and bitter finish.

After Taste: Wet, sweet, creamy and fruity to mouth.

Comments: Taste and palate-wise, its closest rival is Sint Bernardus Abt 12. While the latter impresses with big fat and rich maltyness and intensity, this one features some clever layers of really fruity esters, thick slap of toasty caramel, neat sweet booze and strong bitter hoppiness to make a name of its own. Not as rich as I wished for, it still an impressive Quad. Highly recommended of course and what a nice way to celebrate my #800 ratings! :-)","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2276,"2014-08-04",4.2,"Bottle, 330 ml. Pours clear, light reddish amber with half a finger of off-white head, which dissipates quickly. Bit of stringy lacing is present. Plenty of sweet fruity notes on the nose: orange, peach, citrus, banana and apple are detectable. These rest on a base of rather sweet cereal malts, strangely reminiscent of cheerios. Slight spicy character overall, rounded off with and hints of smoke, almond, alcohol and cheesy yeast. Pretty spectacularly sweet taste, again reminiscent of cheerios initially with the malts coming through thick and fast. The same lighter, sweeter fruity notes as in the aroma make an appearance on the tongue, only joined by cherry and strawberry now. Aftertaste is cereal, caramel and a bit of yeast. Only real complaint Ive got about the taste is alcohol is just a little too noticeable, though just the right level of warmth is provided by it. No problems with the palate; body is full, texture is smooth, carbonation is minimal, goes down a treat. Might be the fruitiest beer that isnt actually made with fruit that Ive ever had, and yet somehow it never gets TOO sweet at any point. Aside from a little too much alcohol taste, this is a real winner.","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

2276,"2014-07-12",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2016 The beer that pioneered the term quadruple, and although the logic extension of the enkel - dubbel - tripel-principle, I still fail to see any distinction between this genre and barley wines and therefore recommend to include quads into the barley wine genre. Anyway: nice mousse-like, fluffy, yellowish, stable head and warm, deeply misty amber colour with a brownish hue; assertive aroma of overripe fruits and liqueur, impressions of candied oranges and dates, pear, banana, mandarine liqueur, marzipan, cloves, caramel candy, cinnamon, liquorice, cacao powder, cognac, white pepper; taste begins with a fruity and even sugary sweetness, quite sharp carbonisation and a smooth and supple caramel maltiness with nice chocolatey and nutty accents, aftertaste spicy with a mildly peppery hoppiness and warm alcohol of brandy and orange liqueur, not that well-balanced considering the fact that its effect is somewhat astringent; the sugary sweetness from the beginning also lingers a bit. I tasted this as an old beer once, in the original trappist version with according label, bottle and glass, and I cannot help to imagine it was better balanced and more refined in those days, as Ive heard more than one elderly pub owner claim in both Flanders and the Netherlands.

2276,"2014-02-12",3.7,"75cL bottle poured into a goblet. Honey, pear, and apple cider are the notes that come off the initial pouring, although the honey and pear seem to slide off into the background if not disappear altogether. After the initial pouring, white grape and raisin take over with lots of sugary, syrupy, sweet caramel. Blackberry and root beer notes fill in some nice background notes on the nose. Deeper down, theres a banana bread-like aroma with a slightly roasted touch. For as complex as the aroma is, the appearance is a bit of a let down. It pours a syrupy, murky copper brown with a very, very light, soapy head that fades to practically nothing; although it does leave some sparse and scattered lacing on the glass. The initial taste on the tongue is almost overwhelmingly sweet. Its a very malty, syrupy, cloying sweet, but it does mellow out. Its still a high / medium-high level of sweetness, but some bitterness pokes through, along with a slight alcohol touch. Once it settles, the taste is best described as a citrus-like sweet and sour (and bitter) with a caramel syrup topping. Its a full bodied beer that feels slick, oily, and sticky on the mouth; its flat as far as carbonation goes. Some lemon and herb qualities come through on the tongue, along with some roastiness and root beer flavors; but ultimately, its the caramel syrup flavor that dominates the tongue. Theres a bit of a vodka-like alcohol note that comes through in the mouth, but its a mellow, high-quality vodka. A resin, or maybe grainy, quality comes through on the finish with some black licorice and an alcohol warmth. The finish is dry, sticky, and slightly astringent with a mostly raisin, white grape, and banana nut muffin flavor lingering.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

2276,"2014-02-09",3.9,"Poured into a goblet out of a 750ml bottle.

Pours a clear light brown with a one finger fluffy white head. The color is actually lighter than I though it would be. Really good head retention but just ok lacing.

Aroma is on the spicy side with somewhat of a fruitcake note to it. I also can pick up quite a bit of bread and grain, more so than in other quads. 

The flavor is on the lighter side for the style. Lots of bread grain from the pilsner malt that is not obscured by the yeast esters. Unfortunately, the lack of yeasty notes limits the complexity a bit. Alcohol is completely hidden but the mouthfeel is a little stickier than I like.

Overall, this is definitely a great quad but not top of the line for me. Probably my third or fourth favorite trappist quad.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

De geur van La trappe Quadrupel is scherp en uitgesproken zoet met een subtiel banaan accent hetgeen wijst op de hogere gisting. Het bier nodigt uit om te proeven, zowel qua geur als qua uiterlijk. De amber kleur is vrij transparant en mits gebruik van het bijpassende glas krijg je de perfecte schuimkraag. Het mondgevoel is verrassend aangenaam, zacht bruisend. De textuur van het bier draagt ertoe bij dat de smaak lang draagt op papillen en achteraan in de mond. De smaak is vol, zacht zoet met toetsen van banaan en een discrete fruitige ondertoon die doet denken aan rode vruchten. De smaak is in perfecte harmonie met het aroma.

attention il va faire chaud sous le tepee !!
Liquide très joli, sur une couleur ambre profond à roux.
Clarté limpide, milliers de bulles fines partout dans le calice.
Mousse beige claire de très bonne texture, crémeuse.
Arômes sur la levure, les céréales, une pointe dorange, puis de la prune, figue, poire cuite,
et une petite pointe dépices des Indes (noublions pas que la bière vient de Hollande, mais
très près de la frontière belge, à côté de Tilburg).
1ère bouche à la texture suave, aux saveurs très construites, partant dune terre de moisson,
pour aller vers le blé mûr, avec une pointe de coriandre. Arrière-bouche un peu épicée.
2ème bouche avec une pointe de girofle sur du bois et des fruits mûrs. Saveurs pleines, larges.
3ème bouche crémeuse, complexe au goût, forte mais avec une rondeur de céréales.
Arrière-bouche un rien poivrée.
Longueur avec du malt à whisky, de la muscade et coriandre, un rien de girofle.
Levure douce, splendide, lisse, tendre.
Alcool magnifiquement dosé, lent et calme, mais chaud sur la longueur.
Finale où la bière se développe pour souvrir comme une fleur, et livrer tout ce quelle 
contient dans sa fabrication.
Cette finale est le propre de toute grande bière. Les quadruples sont dans lobligation,
par leur cahier de charge, de répondre pleinement à ce critère. Sans quoi, il ne faut même
pas parler de quadruple, mais de brunes, même si le degré dalcool est élevé.

4.5 S: Wonderful nose on this. Earthy and fruity - prototypical of the region. Dates, figs, plums, prunes, raisin, and tobacco. Light pepper and clove yeastiness. ""Clean"" earthiness. All the aromas blend together really well. Quite impressed.

3.75 T: Tastes like the nose, except that its much, much earthier. Usually I wouldnt mind this, but it distracts from the fruitiness. Fruits mentioned above with a light spicy yeastiness. Still good.

The taste reflects that banana fruitiness in the first sips though it doesnt take long for the pretty strong alcoholic attack to come through. Reminds me of a very powerful tripel-like taste, overall quite sweet in a fruity, rather than sugary way. 
Theres a distinct alcoholic afterglow, the banana remains but is less outspoken and a bit more of the tripel characteristics lingering (quite bitter and hoppy), not such a long lasting aftertaste.

The beer appears a rusty orange color. Moderately hazy with a light tan head that leaves ample lacing on the goblet. 

The aroma offers fruit, yeast, malt, citrus, berries. While the aroma is pleasant enough, I find it very uncharacteristic of a Belgian quad.

A tad sweet, with plenty of fruit and yeast. Alcohol really emerges in the flavor, a bit more than I prefer. Sweetness grows as I make my way through the beer. Lingering alcohol presence.

Medium to full bodied with relatively high carbonation. 

I have had every Trappist quad multiple times, and this one is my least favorite. Still, a decent beer and worth a try.

Aroma is apricot, peach, loads of marzipan, phenolic, dark dried fruits - loads of them. Taste begins a lot of caramel, some marzipan, light peach. The dark dried fruits rule the middle with caramel. Spiciness is big on the drying finish. Long aftertaste. Palate is full and quite stingy. An excellent beer, especially with cheese.","Alabama, USA","Erasmus_ro"

Dunkles Bernstein mit viel zu schnell verschwindenden Schaum. Ein schön blumig-malziges Aroma mit beeriger Fruchtigkeit. Der Antrunk ist vollmundig, aber für satte 10% Umdrehungen sensationell ""unspritig"". Geschmacklich ausgewogen zwischen Hefe, Malz und langem, leicht bitterem Abgang. Hier dominiert weder die Süße noch die Würze, alles wirkt gut aufeinander abgestimmt. Das La Trappe Quadrupel ist eines der wenigen hochprozentigen Biere, die eine gute Süffigkeit haben.

Aroma consists of caramel, some tropical fruits maybe, some candy sugar and belgiam yeast. Flavour also brings along oak, wood and a more presant caramel taste. It has good a bit sharp mouthfeel at first, but then it smoothens up soft, suiting carbonation. The alcohol is not notable in the aroma nor the flavour.

The aromas is fantastic, exuding hints of overripe bananas, alcohol-soaked nut bread, cocoa, and boozy vanilla.  The taste follows this up perfectly with a flavor profile of dark, fermented fruits, treacle, banana-yeast esters, sherry, bready chocolate, port wine, dates, and decadent port wine, among many others (you could spend an hour picking new-found flavors to add to the description of this beer).  The finish is coating, yet not cloying and of a perfect length with a slight hint of drying, bitter hops along with some dark chococolate, and a figgy presence that leaves the palate waiting anxiously for the next sip.  The mouthfeel is sumptuous and has enough carbonation and life to not be over-bearing.

Yet I was looking for a bit more complexity being a Quad and not a run of the mill BSDA. This is a fine brew nonetheless, but there is no rawness or funk to keep your taste buds guessing.

Aroma is complex: banana has main role than yeast, alcohol, figs, and probably dark fruits. 

The taste is cozy. The sweetness of the malt cover all the path from the beginning to the end. But there is a narrative in there (outset, climax and finishing) that I am not able to explain in details. All in all, the sweetness steals the others flavors. Medium-full body, noticeable carbonation (also in the last part of the taste). Alcohol remarks its presence, but it does not bother.

A fruity aroma, banana, some breadyness and yeastiness, some spice, cloves, dark fruits, plum, lemon, some funkiness. Great, complex nose. Sweetness and banana on the attack, with some clove and a fortified wine flavour, sweet and solvently finish with almost no discernible bitterness, and a little toast as an aftertaste. Alcohol isnt too extreme, but its noticeable on the finish and its not particularly pleasant. Smooth mouthfeel with some good weight to it and a nice spritz of carbonation. Not as good as I was expecting. The alcoholic burn made it a bit unpleasant.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"

2276,"2012-03-13",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/17/2011.  Poured from a 11.2 oz. bottle into a chalice.

The body of the beer is a full, clear brown color with a few tints of amber and ruby. A robust off-white foam with large and small bubbles carelessly intermixed forms after a careful, straight down the middle of the glass pour. It is easy to count on the trappists to make consistently good looking beer.

Dark caramel malts, molasses, some milk chocolate, earthy spices, figs, raisins, and a strong banana kick with some alcohol on the back end all create a nice, full aroma.

As a good quad should, the taste opens up into an opus of flavors. Caramel and molasses provide some firm sweetness up front, coinciding with some dark and bready malts. Some milk chocolate opens the palate for a number of dark fruits; figs, raisins, and plums are all noticeable but not dominant. Some clove and other spices lead into a surprisingly strong banana note, with the conclusion being marked by a firm alcohol presence. All in all, quite a nice beer.

The body is more medium than full, and definitely on the light side for the style, which is my one main knock. With all of the flavors going on here, it still manages to have a clean finish, with a soft booze accent to finish the sip. The carbonation falls somewhere between crisp and creamy and is well proportioned with the beer.

The alcohol is fairly present in this one, but it does not really detract from my tasting experience. Instead, it serves as a gentle reminder that this is a sipper and my speed of consumption should match that.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Nose: quintessential Belgian quad. Nutmeg and cinnamon sticks. Brewers yeast and bread crust. Raisins, dates, figs all mingle together amidst dense breads. Candied sugars, raw pure sugarcane. Hint rooty and vegetal. Red apples. Maraschino cherries. Tickle of spice and heat in the back.

Palate: rich and yummy. Raisins, figs, and prunes. Cinnamon sticks and spice in the back of each swallow. Mouthfeel is cakey and bready. Orange candies and candied oranges. Lingering sweetness where candied pineapples join the oranges. Apple orchards border each quaff. Apple pie, apple strudel  stewed and saucy with cinnamon. Chewy prunes and dates.

Final Thoughts: a divine take on the quadruple style of Belgium. Is it a style? Some argue no, some argue yes. The fact that Belgian brewers still designate some of their darkly rich decadent brews as quadruple is enough for me.

This beer is dark brown with a moderate amount of beige head.  Aroma is lots of alcohol with some dark fruit.  I would have thought this was more like 12 or 13% from the smell.  More dark fruit in the flavor and, just as I thought it would be, extremely alcoholic.","Plano, Texas, USA","Dixonian"
2276,"2011-04-20",3.9,"330 ml bottle from The Royale. Pours a cloudy brownish-plum color with a big, slow-descending, foamy off-white head.

Really sweet, malty, and fruity. Medium-bodied, with soft, medium carbonation and a fruity, coating mouthfeel. Excellent, complex beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2276,"2011-04-20",3.7,"Bottle from Bier Planet, Brussels. This has been sitting in my closet for nearly a year, as I was under the impression that Id already rated it. Oh well. The Easter holiday has sunk in, and I feel the need for a special treat. :-) This heavyweight Koningshoeven beer pours a clear, deep coppery brown body with a medium, off-white head which disappears rather quickly. This must be the first clear-bodied quad Ive had; the others tend to be pretty murky. Nose gives off strong tones of caramel, toffee, figs and raisins in a nice and delicate blend, though a bit subtle. Alcohol may not be present in the nose, but is quite evident in the taste; entwining itself among nutty caramel flavors, hints of burnt sugar, raisins and figs. Very sweet, and kind of straightforward, although the alcohol carries the rather balanced aftertaste on for quite some time. Soft carbonation, and very smooth mouthfeel. This is a pretty good quad, and apparently the origin of the term for the genre. All in all La Trappe Quadrupel is a nice beer, although a bit too sweet and lacking in complexity compared to its Trappist brethren.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

2276,"2011-04-14",3.8,"On tap at Ebenezers the night after Night of the Funk - November 6, 2010. Served in a chalice.

The pour brings a nice moderate brown color with a bit of a crimson-garnet hue. Really nice off-white head with a good dosing of lace on the edges of the glass. The nose brings forward some nice dark fruit characteristics with dates and figs plus some light caramel. A bit of malt and plum plus some light brown sugar notes and a bit of alcohol.

The flavor is nice with a bit of malt sweetness and light booze. The yeast does a nice job creating some esters alongside caramel plus plums, dates, and other dark fruits. A really nice body with a bit of booze. Helps bring out the complexities of the brew. Drinks quite well and was the last Trappist brewery that I needed to try to finish off the list.

2276,"2010-10-29",4.2,"750 ml corked and caged bottle into Trappist glass. Beer #4 in tonights Trappist tasting. Though not side by side, Im going to try and compare this with the Westvleteren 12 and the Rochefort 10 that I drank earlier since all are quads. Pours less murky and is an orange hue with no brown. Has a small head that dissipates too quick, leaving an eyeball and collar of foam. Aroma is more fruity and funky than those other two; smells like carameled apples, banana, raisins, alcohol; seems more aromatic to me. Tastes like cotton candy; sweet with no bitterness. More carbonation than the other two quads, but still just at a medium level; full-bodied, not as creamy as the Westy; tangy finish. Wow, Im pretty impressed with this actually. Could it be better than the almighty Rochefort? I think so. Right up there with Westvleteren, in my opinion. Re-rate: the alcohol becomes a bit too much after awhile. I never had a problem with either the Westvleteren or the Rochefort with this. The alcohol in those beers never overwhelmed the taste. So, in revision, its obvious the other two beers are better made. This is still one tasty beer, though.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

2276,"2010-07-27",4.1,"Strong Belgian-style beers, I think, were my first big beer love and this is a good example of why. They are huge and alcoholic but still maintain a soft drinkability which is what makes them stand out against English and American brews of the same strength. Well, that and the yeast, of course. This pours a nice orange color, so deep as to be nearly brown, w/ a creamy head of white bubbles which wanes to a soft ring around the glass. Yeast bread and bananas dominate the nose w/ a sugary rum soaked raisin sweetness in the background. This is medium bodied and ever so slightly sticky but w/ huge amount of brisk but soft carbonation to cut the thickness. It is this kind of mouthfeel that separates the men from the boys as far as Belgians styles go. It has that feeling of crossing the tongue w/o getting it wet. Just lovely.

A - Scarlet mahogany color, a bit lighter than others Ive had of the style. Large, light, foamy, bubbly, light beige head with average retention and a nice thin foamy, sticky lace left.

S - A fruity and slightly tart sweet aroma that reminds me a bit of a dark fruit liqueur or something like a cognac. Dark berry, fig, date, and a bit of a citrus/melon aroma. Alcohol is quite present. Hints of dark malt and some sweetness and a bit of spice. Dominated by the fruit with some tartness and by the alcohol.

T - Rich malty taste consisting of some bread and caramel taste provide the initial taste and a base for the beer. Soon after, some dark fruit comes out with raisin, plum, fig, and apple coming out. Also some cinnamon amongst other spices. Overall a sweet, fruity beer with a fair amount of spice and a touch of alcohol. A bit of earthy bitterness mid sip, but not much.

Caramel-orange in colour, slightly hazy, foamy-soap off-white head that disappears pretty quick and only a bit of lacing is left, here and there. Full of big bubbles are stuck to the glass and a few pop-up to the surface for carbonation. The nose has fruit (like oranges, apples, cherries and some other darker ones too), nuts, rust, alcohol, spices and candy. Yes, lots here, but not sure how well it mixes together. Caramel malt is in the taste with a lot of the things that were in the aromas. The alcohol warms a bit (which is great for winter) but does not burn. Lots of fruits present. So, pretty good overall, and nice to have from time to time, but there is just that little thing that bugs me with the blend of everything. It reminds me of paint (or something close in that range).

This one pours a deep amber color with an active off-white head.  The head is up then down in no time.  The nose is spicy with notes of cinnamon, sugar cookie, raisin, and molasses.  I feared that this one would be overly sweet and fortunately its not.  The taste takes on more of a perfume like note with touches of spice, caramel malt sweetness, a hint of tobacco, ripe fruit, and a slight booziness.  The taste isnt bad, but it lacks complexity and depth.  The body doesnt bring anything exciting to the party.  It has a medium body and a high carbonation.

2276,"2009-11-06",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2009 From bnensonb. Thanks again, man. This years bottle as a Konings Hoeven and Im starting to wonder why I have been drinking all of those huge, hoppy beers and all of those imperial stouts. This beer pours a thick, tall head with a very dark, hazy brown liquid under. The nose is a sweet caramel-apple maltienss and the initial taste is the same. There are only slight hints of hops, and the mid palate and finish are just dry enough that this doesnt leave a sugary-sweet after taste. This is a style that I am coming to like more and more, and I have been regularly surprised by the quality of this and other brews of its sort. Another keeper!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","allendodd"
2276,"2009-11-06",3.7,"33cl bottle - shape and label different (and classier!) than the one pictured.

Pours a nice hazy amber with a big, creamy off-white head with good retention and decent lacing. 

Aroma of yeast, orchard fruit and malt. 

Medium carbonation, smooth mouth feel. Heavy-bodied Belgian, err, Dutch, ale. 

Flavour is, again, orchard fruit, some caramel, and raisins. Nice citric note to improve drinkability. Different herbal spices in there, too. Sweet, but not overly so - and the finish is sour and dry. Lingering sour after taste, too. Alcohol is present (well, at 10 % abv), but not overwhelming. 

Agreeable Trappist quadrupel, ""healthier"" than some overly sweet dubbels and tripels I know from Belgium. Sessionability is, at this abv, necessarily limited. Complex, nicely balanced beer.","Offenbach, GERMANY","sound67"

The yeast is prevalent, with the spices dancing around your tongue as the finish turns into a warming sensation in the chest.

The aroma is relatively complex -- other elements are noticeably present but difficult to distinguish -- and culminates in a sort of earthy, fresh smell of the outdoors. Flavor comes in three stages: initially a strong maple character, then a wave of fig and dark fruit that crescendos to a strongly alcoholic, malty finish -- a flavor that is sweetly balanced and symphonically complex.

2276,"2009-08-11",3.4,"This is certainly an enjoyable beer, but trying the Dubbel, Tripel and Quad together, Im highly confused about the Quads significantly higher ratings.  True, its a bit better.  The flavor is fuller, the malt is richer and the beer is a bit more warming, but the flavor profile is in line with the rest of the lineup with the smaller beers.  Im even lowering the rating a bit in deference to style comparisons.  On a flat rating scale, this would be more highly rated than the Tripel or the Dubbel.  At any rate, the Quad pours a deep medium red. Its translucent with amber highlight at certain angles.  Its actually less murky than the Tripel (maybe a function of the pour).  Theres a bit more lacing, though.  The aroma has more banana bread and clove than I noticed in the previous Koningshoeven beers.  There are also aromas of vanilla, brandy and apricots/plums.  The flavor is similar with peppery spicing.  Im again impressed at the depth of flavor these Trappist brewers are able to get out of such simple ingredients.  Its one hell of a strain of a yeast that can impart this depth of flavor.  If not for style comparisons, Id bump up my ratings in every category.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

2276,"2009-03-27",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2014 This is a re-rate and update.  I was going to delete my initial notes, but decided they should stay to prove my suspicion that I purchased and tasted a bad (very bad) bottle.  The color and appearance of the beer were the same, with the exception of the head.  The head was thicker and laced around the glass very nicely.  The flavors were full and a lot deeper.  The only quality I really didnt appreciate was the sourish and sweet finish.  Obviously this beer is WAY better than I initially experienced.  Now for my original notes from March 2009:  This quad is a huge disappointment.  It pours a cloudy reddish-brown color with a very minimal head.  The aroma is quite sweet and even a little sour, with some hints of apples, grapes and oranges.  The nose had a champagne-like character.  The flavors are nothing like a good quad should be.  This is very sour and way too fruity.  There is hardly any sense of big maltiness like a good quad should have.  The aftertaste is absolutely horrendous Its very sour and bitter at the same time, which for me isnt a good combination.  I took only two or three sips of this and chucked the rest of my 750ml bottle.

Fat, effervescent bubbles pool into a thick, foamy blanket that sticks around for a good while.  Soapy sheet lacing breaks apart and drips back into the body, scant spots remaining behind to dry.  Big aromas of candy sugar, caramel, dates and figs are first to hit.  A creamy wave of vanilla sugar and lactose is son to follow.  Perfumy flowers lend spicy depth and complexity to the nose.  Flavors are rich and mostly sweet, a myriad of dark, sugary fruit variations playing off of one another.  Notes of hazelnut, maple, candied pears, vanilla and cream enhance the decadent, dessert-like taste.  A substantial, creamy body finishes of the sticky side, but the 10% ABV is almost completely concealed, making it dangerously drinkable.

Very nice indeed.

Flavour: Front is strong in alcohol but not repulsive, rather inviting, you can feel thelcohol warmth and spices as the beer is getting warm you can distinguish nice, rounded bready (white bread) and grainy taste that is very distinguishable. You can feel fresh bread from the barley together with flour, slightly bitter, smooth and creamy in texture, a hint of brown sugar, alcohol is very well hidden, some hints of wheat, finish duration is long. Alcohol content to comparewith 10% of alcohol vol. of Grimbergen optimo Bruno is much better hidden, plums, prune apple, bread skin, alcoholic, sour bread, oats, orange. Taste is full and complex.
Palate: Body is medium to full, texture is creamy, carbonation is very soft and gentle, finish is moderate alcoholic, a bit salty.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

There are also some fruity ester notes, too. The flavor follows the aroma: peppery and grassy notes at first with a sweet malt character. As the beer ventures back, caramel flavors become quite strong. Ethanol flavors also strengthen and a tate of anise begins to come through.

I feel this is a very refined quad and holds its own with not only the Chimay Grand Reserve and St Bernardus Abt 12, but also the Roche 10. Now I cant wait to find a bottle of Achel Extra Bruin!

2276,"2008-02-10",3.9,"750, corked and baled. Just pulled this off the shelf at regular price, so it cant even be a year old yet. So this is just a control rating, not a ""real"" rating of this beer when its at the peak of its powers. Pours a lovely glowing dark brown with a nice moussy dark tan head. No shortage of lace. Big fruity toffee nose. Nice medium body with attractive tiny-bubbled carb. Fruity, bready, toffee-like and somewhat vinous notes angle for prominence on the mid-palate. Long dry crackery finish. This is some wonderful beer, but everything about it, from the rather forward sweetness to the hints of twang near the finish, lead me to believe that this would massively benefit from a few years in the dark. That would probably turn it into a world-beater.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

A bit over-the-top strength-wise but has enough hedonistic elements to make it rather pleasant, but not great.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2276,"2007-10-04",4.0,"33 cl bottle from Bieropholie, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass.
App.:  Deep red-copped, clear, large off-white head.
  
Aroma:  Big, crunchy malts, plenty of dried fruit, light minty herbals, sort of an odd vegetal woodiness, brown sugar and molasses; lightly nutty, a touch floral, touches of esters.
  
Palate:  Full-ish body, syrupy, soft effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Huge deep maltiness, brown sugar and molasses, lots of dark dried fruits, woody and slightly alcoholic (only slightly??); some cherries; quite sweet, but it works with the bitterness and slight tang; a fair bit of alcohol on swallowing; leaves light peach/apricot and vanilla behind.

2276,"2007-04-14",3.4,"Sampled March 2007
Pours a brilliantly clear, ruby hued color with a two-finger thick, amber tinged tan colored head.  Quite fruity smelling; notes of mace intermingles with notes of raisins, prunes figs and concentrated cider.  Actually after a bit more digging there is definitely a cherry aroma here as well.  There is a touch of oxidation aromatics as well; hints of Madeira, sherry and perhaps a damp woodiness that is not quite like wet cardboard yet.  Really the concentrated fruit character is what is most noticeable, but there is a nice backdrop of sweet spices (cardamom, clove and perhaps some mace).

The beer is fairly sweet, yet not sticky.  The sweetness accentuates notes of concentrated fruit, which are a mix of prunes, figs and some light date notes.  There is a nice backdrop of spiciness here that is a mix of clove, a touch of cardamom, a dusting of ginger and even an orange-citrus note towards the end.  The finish remains sweet and rich with a rum-like flavor and a touch of alcohol bite.  I would not describe the alcohol as hot though, it just serves to add a touch of warming character.  There is a touch of oxidation here; its biggest effect seems to be an added chewy, malty, almost meaty caramel / Maillard browning character.

An interesting brew, that seems somehow to be lacking a little something.  I could wish for a bit more chewy malt character and perhaps some more body, but on the other hand it is nice that this is not a super heavy brew.  Still it is a good brew, and certainly contributes a nice warm glow after a couple glasses from this 750ml bottle.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Sweet caramel malt dominates the flavor at first and then some fruit, real banana, and spice flavors begin to show.  The alcohol stays in the shadows at first and then rushes out just before the finish.  The alcohol seems a bit strong at first, but quickly retreats and assimilates with the rest of the flavors and lets the moderately bitter finish balance the beer.

Pours a dark red, with a frothy one finger head that fades quickly to a thick cap. The cap lasts throughout the entire drink, and leaves behind a spotty lace.

Smell; lots of dark fruits, with plums, grapes and maybe a little fig. Theres also a fairly strong sugary, candy like aroma, as well as alcohol.

Taste; very sweet, and candy like upfront. Once you get past the overbearing sweetness, theres some dark fruits, and a pretty nice bready maltiness. The alcohol is very much present, and actually becomes a nit to much after a while.

It has me wondering just how much the running order during a tasting session influences perceptions of a beer? Drank this one immediately after a seven-year-old Hahn Special Vintage 2000 English strong ale and the juxtaposition did this no favours. Not to say this is a bad quad, but it seemed sugary-sweet and frivolous after the austerity of the Hahn. This looked divine: hazy chestnut with a tall, loose sudsy head that laced magnificently. However, the aroma seemed teeth-rottingly sweet and artificially perfumey. It was all Bazooka Joe bubblegum, cane sugar and Parma Violet candies. Much simpler than the tripel and very sugary. Great creamy mouthfeel, nice and full. Carries its alcohol very well but too sweet for my taste. Bubblegum again, toffee and a big warming brandy finish. Ive enjoyed the La Trappe range more than most but this seems like a weak link. Ill take the tripel and dubbel over this.

Initial flavor is a sweet banana clove almost like a good Hefe finishes.  Mouth feel is smooth, slightly oily,  with moderate carbonation.  Hides the alcohol VERY well.

2276,"2006-02-25",4.2,"750 ml bottle.  The first pour of this quad poured up an absolutely beautiful crystal clear dark amber into my snifter.  The second pour from the bottle had the same color, but was very cloudy as the yeast had mixed in.  Both pours had an inch worths of a creamy white head that lasted a good while and settled into a thin foam for the entire glass.  There was a speckled lacing on the glass.  It is highly carbonated and feels light on the palate.  The aroma is of candied fruits and spice while the 10% ABV makes itself known.  I find this very tasty and refreshing.  I was expecting a sweet taste that Ive found in other quads, but it wasnt here.  There is in fact a slight sour bite to this guy.

2276,"2006-02-03",4.0,"Weird thoughts passed my mind as I sipped this. Unbeknown to myself the origin of these visions of summer and winter cascading over each other in images as if it was slide night and the pictures were in fast forward. It wasnt a complex brew by all means, but the time involved in drinking a bottle, it seemed, would transcend me beyond my evening of throwing a ball to my three dogs. Poured into a chalice at just on cool, I half expected a dark brew as it appeared through the brown glass, but was greeted with a fiery bronze ale, with very fine lines of bubbles flitting up to surface beneath a thin, rocky white layer of whipped cream. Head held its ground for the length to trail a fine lace down the glass. Rich and sharp, ripe fruits on the nose with apricots, oranges and strawberries. Candi sugar offers a sweeter edge whilst a good dose of peppery, spicy hops give it some needed bounce. Juicy citric fruits dominate the palate with undertones of peaches, biscuity malts, light earthy and spicy hops, and a little doughy yeast. Medium bodied and smooth as silk with very soft carbonation giving the flavours a nice roundness. Alcohol was close to non-existent for a beer of such strength offering only a light warmth in the swallow. Creamy finish has more fruits and a very gentle tangy astringency, with a long quenching citrus aftertaste. Its only flaw was a lightly metallic edge that grew near to the end, about the time I awoke from my weird trance. This was a lovely and unique beer that what it lacked in complexity, it just made up for in control and balance. Absolutely delicious, another bottle and Ill be back in the happy space.

Nice mouthfeel, marred a little by the alcohol. This was obviously in very good nick - but is it not bottle-conditioned? I might have to rethink cellaring a bottle...

2276,"2006-01-27",3.8,"11.2 oz bottle is few years old. No date given. From a 4 pack that had the blonde, dubbel, triple, and a nice trappist glass. Foggy, light brown. Small, tan head quickly disappears. Aroma of dark fruits, caramel/toffee, rich malt, yeast, candi sugar, anise. Flavor matches the aroma up front, then transforms to dry, roasty, slightly bitter alcohol. Finish is yeasty alcohol. Aftertaste is a combination of the two phases with a bittersweet licorice flavor standing out. Full, creamy body. Rather tame for what it is. Nothing about this brew is looking to stop you from dinking it in excessive quantity. Way too easy to drink. Probably 12% by now and alcohol is only detectable in the finish.

2276,"2006-01-21",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2006 My recent trip to Amsterdam was the occasion for my first encounter with Dutch beer. As a start, I decided I couldnt go wrong with La Trappes Quadrupel - and I was right. The friendly barman at In de Wildeman poured it in its proper glass producing a beautiful dark brownish red body, reminding of wet cherry wood. The creamy puff of light beige foam slowly descended to a thin cap, leaving incredibly sticky lacing on all sides. In the nose, dusty dark chocolate, figs and plums immediately appear suggesting the familiar trappist combination. However, other lighter notes are also prominent: caramel, berries, cream and particularly pear which was even more emphasized as the beer warmed. A sweet and inviting aroma. On the tongue, Irish creme, cherries, caramel, apple, pear, coffee and slight bitter malt flavor are the protagonists. Again pear is very much the key element, which I distinctly enjoyed as it conjures up the delicious desert, Poire Belle-Hélène. I found the palate a bit overcarbonated but the finish is ultra creamy which makes up for that small annoyance. Some time after the swallow a surprising and unmistakable marron glacé flavor materializes on the tongue. Just wait for it. Overall, an outstanding effort; but I must warn you: do not drink it under 12°C!","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Taste of mild sweet citrus & banana malt, raisins and apple - stronger on warming - and a touch of hops - oh, wait, here comes the alcohol.  Palate is average bodied, quite complex as it warms up.

2276,"2005-08-20",4.7,"A common wisdom in Belgian is that foreign beer is crap. A second common wisdom is that the worst foreign beer is produced in Holland. The fact this beer is a Dutch trappist seemed a strange contradiction, but this beer exceeds all expectations.
It has a beautiful amber color, with lots of little acid bubbles and a smooth off-white head. A well mixed aroma, with toffee, chocolat, raisin, alcohol, ginger and a little citrus and strawberry. Creamy and full mouthfeel, very well balanced between bitter and sweetness, both fruity and malty, with subtle spicing. Sampled together with a Rochefort 10, this beer is clearly better balanced and has a more softer mouthfeeling. The finish is very sticky, with more malty tones. Together with St-Bernardus, this beer will be my preferred alternative to the sold out Westvleteren.","Leuven, BELGIUM","bask"

2276,"2005-08-17",3.8,"Translucent and magnifying bronze with a copiously foamy, tan-to-grey head.  Aroma is nice and sweet, comprised of ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, apple pie, golden raisins, candi sugar, and the slightest trace of strawberry crème.  Flavor unfolds in a consequential manner.  Toffee, chocolate, light figs, caramel-dipped golden delicious apples and a prevailing candi sweetness.  Excellent assertive spicing, bundling generous handfuls of ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon at one time and dashing each composition with anise and cocoa powder.  Sweetened profile envelops elements of brown sugar crumble and maple ribbons, and theres nothing that can shake this sweetness, which seems to exponentially increase with each sip.  Medium bodied and dry at times.  Finishes like a seasonal cinnamon spice ice cream, some recently fallen leaves and a note of earthen tobacco, which is inevitably overcome by a humming sweetness, gingerly beckoning all other elements to fade into the night.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The taste starts as expected with lots of sweetness up front but at no point does it go over the top. I get a lot of ripe fruit and balanced spice in midesection and finished off with some surprising bitterness and even a hint of oak. The feel is lush and sticky, but again it is not over top top.

Has that definite Belgian yeasty aroma, but also corriander, clove, vanilla, (green?) raisin and other light fruits (banana, orange peel) and just a hint of rum.  It looked gorgeous in its glass, decent head sat atop a somewhat hazy orange body.  First sip is fruity and sweet, and you cant really detect the alcohol at this point (dangerous)  As it warms, it becomes a bit more astringent, but thats nicely balanced by your tongue going numb.

What a crrrracker! This one is a regular purchase for me. This more than any other beer I have tried so far has an aroma that says ""Im going to get you drunk!"" Dark amber body topped with a nice even head that is sadly gone a little too soon but no matter, it leaves a good coverage that lasts for the rest of the glass. Lots of different fruits in the nose  but what really gets me is something that I can only describe as reminding me of Amyl Nitrate. I swear you could loose yourself just smelling this stuff. Typical quad with just a bit of something extra. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but verging on the full side and I must say the palate is great. The swoosh of sweetness at the back of your mouth at the finish is great. Fantastic flavour with quite a lot to get excited about! Bananas, pineapples, apples and a bit of sweetness but just the right amount is the order of the day. Finish is briefly bitter then almost instantly gently sweet and lengthy.

Forward aroma honeyed and overripe ripe fruit then whiff maple syrup. Flavor is big - amazing tropical fruit-like presence at front , diving into roasted malty and brandy-like sustain finishing with a gentle bitterness. Stately while at the same time friendly. Rounded bitterness re-emerges in elegant swells. Mouth embracing, slight candy feel, warming sweet/alcohol sensations in palate and back of mouth - opulent with aromatic information. Evolves constantly!!!!  I could smell the empty glass for hours. Less austere and more exuberant than some Trappists. One of the most fragrant and generously flavorful things Ive tried.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

Nice malt aroma in the beginning, with port and prune notes; but later the aroma becomes much sweeter. Strong, thick-bodied, the taste is sweet and malty; the alcohol is hidden well, but for me this boy is a little too sweet.  It finished more dry than expected, with some spiciness too.   I wish it had some bitterness to balance things out.  I liked it more as it warmed, but it still lacked some balance.

Some solventy notes of alcohol in the nose.  Light vinous raisiny & Rome apple notes.  Flavor is well balanced, but a little alcoholic.  Flavors of buttery diacetyl mend well with the apple flavor to make a caramel apple that is sweet up front.  Some floral plum flavors as well.  Bready malt, and did I mention alcohol.  It becomes more fruity/estery as it warms, but too many of these will make for a head banger of a morning.  Light spicy yeasty finish with plums.  Semi sweet aftertaste, but just enough not to be cloying.  Aftertaste is clove yeast & toasted malt.  Higher carbonation, but not has high as one would expect.    Smooth, surprisingly well hidden alcohol given the flavor and aroma profile, & medium bodied.  I like this more than the tripel, but still a little too sweet to drink a lot of at one time.

There is more complexity in the quad.. flavors go in every direction.  Mainly sweet malt base but then a variety of dark fruits and spices explode on the tongue, The sweetness, fruit flavors, spices, bitterness, and carbonation offset each other evenly and create a lively and interesting brew. Almost a sensory overload at times.  No fault to be found here.. quite excellent!  All the beers presented in the gift pack were variations on the same flavor theme, and all were imensely enjoyable.

2276,"2004-08-09",4.1,"Bottle at 55 degrees F. Pours hazy orange/amber with a generous off-white head. Aroma of caramel covered apricots, spices and fresh yeast rolls. Initial taste is very sweet reminiscent of peaches, apricots, vanilla and fresh bread. Sweetness is dominant but somewhat curtailed by the 10% alcohol which gives this brew a slight mid-palate bite. Very smooth and full-bodied mouthfeel. Finishes with a faint hop presence. A very tasty Trappist Quad.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Re-rated at International Night of Swill at Gregs (obviously a break from the swill).  Thanks to Jan Primus for the bottle.  It was interesting going back, as this was one of the first experiences I had with the style last year.  Now I was not near as impressed.  I thought it still had a fantastic aroma, but didnt find anything truly impressive of its appearance.  If anything now, I found that it was a little too one sided and unbalanced - the strong malt character and alcohol were overwhelming.  Sharp was the word that came to mind and the whole package was a little watery.  Having said all this, I still found the beer to be very enjoyable and I would have it again, I just wasnt as wowed as originally when I gave it a 4.3.  Original ratings were 8/5/8/4/18.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

I dont know if my bottle wasnt stored properly but thier is a coppery/metallic overtone. Nonetheless, the flavors that I pick up are of yeast, light bananas, a little soap, and brown sugar/honey.

Ok, its quite nice in its own dessert-kind-of way - but way too sweet and not very complex. Once again, not up to the trappist scale.

Aroma is largely wafting with phenolic yeast and an ethonal alcoholic punch with a modest sweetness of malts lending dulled citrus of melons and orange with hints of banana, raisin, and plum and some touches of caramel skirt underneath. Taste has a nice medley of dark fruits noted in the smell and a malty smooth sweetness with nice yeasty underlaying notes of clove and bits of medicinal plastic. Overall very soild in its length of malts, dashing with dark fruits and trailing with caramel, lighter toffee, and slight mild spice in the finish. The alcohol hardly makes any appearance but there is some warmth sneaking in. Feel is nice and smooth, lightly chewy and creamy with a lighter side of the heavy or full but yet, not medium either. Quite a nice feel, fits well with the malts and yeast. Well balanced and pleasingly smooth and quite quaffable for having 10% ABV, although that sneaks up on ya quickly lending a bit of respect and engaging you to slow down and enjoy it.

(Rating: Ar. 8 App. 5 Fl. 9. Pal. 5 OA. 18)

Re-rate: I was a bit surprised seeing how high Ive rated this one as La Trappes other beers havent pleased me much.

Surprised by initial lack of head and, if not for seeing through the brown bottle, how light in colour it is. The aroma is big, however.

Sweet aroma with some dark fruitiness and caramel malt. Same goes for flavour which is, if I remember right, not nearly as complex as the other Trappist quads. Mainly caramel, or maybe rather nouggat, and it feels theres some nice hoppy freshness on the finish.

Reminds me a lot of Chimay Rouge this time around, although its not really that similar. A whole lot sweeter too.

Its not awesome as I thought first time around but still very pleasant. It would probably rate higher for me if it had something to back up that sweetness.","Falun, SWEDEN","Kalli"

The aroma is very pleasant, yeasty with sweet malty candy fruitiness reminding peaches, plums and green raisins without forgetting alcohol notes. Good medium to full mouthfeel, rather silky. The taste is not as refined as the scent, it's toffeish, peachy, very malty and sweet with a flowery spicy and hoppy finish that does not grab me particularly.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2276,"2003-10-12",4.1,"Pours a very viscous looking hazey golden color with very little head (no head for mine - bad bottle?).  The aroma was somewhat damp and musty and spicy; sort of like walking into a 200 year old basement.  The flavor is quite fruity and malty with some bitterness to help it out.  There is a bit of alchohol noted.  Each swallow produces a new flavor progression that ranges from the dry start to the malty finish.  There is an aftertaste of french bread.  The palate is quite hearty with each mouthfull like taking a bite if bread.  This is better as it warms; and in turn, it's warming me.  Overall, yes this is a unique expereince for somebody who has not yet had any of the Trappistes.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

An incredible pour, very deep rich which gives way to a deep ruby color with a huge creamy head.  I mean as soon as you open the bottle and begin to pour, the aroma fills the room, with a fragrant floral aroma that is likened to walking into a flower shop that is right next door to a bakery and maybe a produce department for the fresh fruit aromas.  The taste is like a very very good brandy, or scotch.  The burn is their but quickly fades in a texture on your tongue that is very exciting.  An incredible mouthfeel, with flavors that are too long to list.  Extremely complex and lively.  One of my new favorites.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
2276,"2003-09-05",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2004 75 cL bottle, La Trappe glass, 50 degrees.  Toughest damn cork I've ever fought against.  First pour yields no head because I'm an idiot.  Deep red-brown body is murky and opaque without any visible particles.  Aroma is strong enough to let its presence be known from 2 feet away.  Cookie, caramel, and slightly nutty (walnut) malt is dominant; earth, cobweb yeast is the next most powerful aroma; also resent are prune, date, unripened banana, peach cobbler, some sort of sweet wine, toffee, and a some fusel alcohol.  That's a nose full!  Heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter flavor becomes a moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter finish.  The acidity has a fruity sourness to it.  Second pour produces a gigantic, creamy, frothy, off-white head that lasts well.  The mouthfeel has also become much smoother now.  Alcohol burn starts up front and continues throughout, but is not nearly as bad as I was anticipating at 10% ABV.  Very smooth oily/creamy texture, medium-heavy body, lively carbonation.  I pick up some grape flavors that weren't in the aroma, but everything else translates quite well.  The bottom line is: looks, smells, tastes, feels excellent, 10% ABV, 75 cL, and a free glass for only $6?  I'm sold","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

2276,"2002-11-05",4.0,"[2000-2001] Re-rate: I was VERY unfair to this beer in my original rating.  I had a bit of a head cold, so that may have had something to do with it.  This beer has a beautiful head and a dark amber color, with an aroma rich with fruits of all kinds.  It has a very full body with a malty and sweet flavor.  I still taste a lot of fruit and chocolate in this one, but I find it more pleasant this time.  The alcohol content is very well masked.  Original rate: 3 - The aroma of this beer is dominated by fruit (raisins, apples) and alcohol, which is also what is most present in the flavor.  The alcohol presense swells gradually in your mouth, until your tongue receives a burning/cleansing sensation that I expect more from wine than from beer.  There are some subtle notes present, though.  Chocolate being the one I notice the most.  Its pretty good, I guess.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

2276,"2002-11-01",2.9,"Though still made in the Koningshoeven monastery the actual brewing and distribution is controlled by the Bavaria brewery who specialise in low to medium quality pilsners. The dominant quality of this quadrupel, even with my three year old bottle, is the alcohol - it burns like a spirit or liqueur, and warms the stomach ulcers. The nose is warm rum-soaked raisins and damp wooly blankets.  Initially a shock of liquid brown sugar, this is quickly slashed with a steel knife of acid. Then the melted christmas cake flows around the mouth before the alcohol starts to kick in, growing, blossoming, swelling to a deep, deep burn. The whole subsides to damp cardboard followed by a warm gentle bitterness. There is chocolate, wood smoke, orange peel and celebrated dark Oxford prune juice. Sounds good? Well, its actually fairly clumsy. The journey joggles along like a Rusian taxi driven by a trainee train driver; yet the destination is constantly predictable. The are no surprises here - no rewards. Despite the range of flavours and the high strength this is a rather dull beer.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

The ""Koeningshoeven"" version is excellent as well but lacks some of the alcohol and spice the previous version had and adds more sweetness.

Pleasant spicy notes, flowers, candyish aromas and light bitterness. Taste is malty and sweet with caramel and candied fruit notes, light spices, Belgian yeasts, flowers, and light alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-full with lots of carbonation tingling the palate. Finishes with more sweet malts, candied fruits, Belgian yeast, spices and light alcohol notes.

Flavor has some pear flavor, but also sweetens much towards the middle offering some raisin flavor.  The alcohol is high, but quite tasty and this beer is not astringent.

It disappeared quickly, though, but I cant say the same for the taste.  Its sweet, pungent, and bitter all at the same time.  Its not too carbonated, there isnt anything to detract from the not-so-complex mixture of tastes.  The sweetness is cloying at times, sticky on the lips as well, and there isnt much middle to the one---just a caramely sweetness and then the pungent alcohol finish.

Malty sweet, slightly alcoholic flavor with toffee, butter and upcoming porto and sherry flavors. Bubblegum, Well controlled oxidation. This beer really matures well.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
2276,"2002-03-17",3.6,"I have to say that I was a bit let down by this beer.  I cant claim to be an expert on trappist ales, but after trying all three Chimays I had my hopes set high.  Upon pouring, I saw a nice color and head, which was complimented by a hoppy smell with hints of pear and peach.  But the flavor turned out pretty unbalanced - not badly so, but something about it made it rather difficult to drink.  It seemed like the alcohol was too much for the flavor.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
2276,"2002-03-11",2.5,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2006 750ml bottle. Head is mostly lasting. Body is hazy medium amber. Aroma is lightly malty (bread), lightly yeasty (mold), with a strong note of alcohol. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.  As I was rating this, I thought maybe I was being too harsh, but in the end I decided that my gut feeling, which was that I wanted absolutely nothing to do with this beer based on the boozy, lacking aroma and the sweet, burning mouth experience. Very unpleasant.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2276,"2002-01-26",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2005 re-rate:  I just enjoyed this with a complex and dark Havana Partagas Churchill deluxe after dinner.  The acidic and sweet level of this beer paired perfectly with this cigar.  11.2 oz/ ""00/""01 bottling:  This is one complex ale.  Much better out of the small bottle, for some unusual reason??  This has aged into a wonderful brew and should do so for a good five more years.  Pours an off tan very sticky head with great retemtion.  ARoma of plastic?, prunes and other dark fruits.  Copper color like an American barleywine, especially Foghorn.  taste is very rich and sweet, similar to Brown Shugga by Lagunitas.  Rum, candied fruits and molasses come to mind in this mind boggling ale.  This is a beer which will receive many mixed reviews because it comes in so many forums. (crocks, corked and small bottles)  If found in good condition, you won""t be disappointed.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2276,"2001-12-20",4.4,"2000/01 bottling.  Notes of molasses and figs among other sweet things in the subtle nose; body is cognac-like, in color and texture (no head to speak of); flavor very rich and malty, sweet but with a hint of bitterness, chocolatey-plummy-bready.  I didnt think it overly yeasty, as some have complained; very close to some American barley wines.  Whatever you want to call this complex and intriguing beer, its a great one.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2276,"2001-12-03",4.5,"Magnificent. Well worth the price, this is full and strong (although the alcohol is a minor taste component) and almost wine-like (think a good tawny port). A lady friend of mine who ordinarily cant stand ales loves this stuff.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"
2276,"2001-11-27",4.5,"Smooth thick caramel that refuses to dry out with age like many other trappist brews.  A touch of sherry and plum add to the complex character of this deceptivly massive beauty.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","Northernbrewer"

2276,"2001-09-16",4.1,"Compared to its dubbel cousin this was slightly harsh, the alcohol was more prevalant as was a yeasty feel in the finish. While this does have the same general flavors as the dubbel, and it still is very good, it wasnt as enjoyable.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
2276,"2001-09-16",3.9,"Not quite as refined and easy as the dubbel.  Same primary flavors, including plum and oak, and almost equally as malty.  However, yeast is too strong a characteristic, and detracted slightly from my enjoyment. Bolder alcohol character as well, although not to the point that it negatively impacts the flavor or aroma, which again is chocolate, brown sugar, and plum.  The experience is similar to Westvleteren 8.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
2276,"2001-09-15",4.3,"Wow. Way better than their dubbel or blonde. Deep ruby color. Nice thick head that leaves Belgian lace all over your glass. Ripe fruit (plum?) aromas and flavor.
