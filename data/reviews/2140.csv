2140,"2017-03-17",3.8,"750ml bottle obtained in a trade. Pours out golden orange. Hazy with a foamy/fizzy white head. Lasting head with good sized bubbles. Carbonation seems good. Smells very peaty/smoky like an Islay scotch. Surprised by how powerful this peat is. Also has that apricot sour fruity scent. A little winey on the back end as well. Pleasant. Nice smooth sour taste to it. Light fruits and a strong peaty finish. Very special flavor. The combination of peaty smokiness and sour fruits works pretty well. Its good but I dont know how much I can have of it. It starts smooth and sour with a nice fruity profile on it and then you swallow and get that pure peatiness throughout combined with a small tart. Good mouthfeel. Full and properly carbonated. Good aftertaste. Enjoyable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Sudz4Dayz"

Clear bright orangey-golden with a medium-high white head, good retention, leaving little lacing. Aroma is of wild yeast and meaty smoke with bright citrus and light cereals. Taste is tart and citric but never overly sour with meaty smoke, citrus/oranges, zesty notes and cereals. Medium body, but on the light-ish side. Moderate-medium carbonation. Zesty tart finish with never overpowering meaty smoke aftertaste. A bit of alcohol warmth as well. The smoke is always there and upfront but never overpowering everything else as the wild yeast and tart citrus presence balances it quite well. Rather easy drinking.
