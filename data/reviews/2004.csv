2004,"2017-05-06",4.5,"A really, very good brown. Deep and rich in malty, chocolatey sweetness. Has a nice caramel backbone and a sharp bitter finish. Tried with Dave, Josh, Brandon, and Brian at Bad Apple in 2017 after ASEH.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
2004,"2017-04-27",3.6,"Pours a brown with a medium tan head. I get a heavier dose of chocolate and caramel in the aroma, along with nuts, earthy malts, and a faint licorice impression. The taste is sweet with some lighter bitterness. Here we get chocolate and cocoa dominating, some pine, earthy malts, a fair amount of licorice, and minor cereal. The aftertaste is an earthy cocoa flavor which is strong and lasts for a good amount of time. This is more full in body, with a chewy texture, and about average in carbonation. Its pretty good.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
2004,"2017-04-24",4.7,"As good a brown ale as I've ever had. No inauthentic tastes with a rich malt palate. The palate and aroma both have a complexity that adjusts throughout. 




In a bottle - Naperville.

2004,"2016-09-18",3.7,"Tasted from a 12oz. bottle (thanks Joe). It poured a dark reddish brown hue with a frothy beige head. Spiced malt aroma with a roasted malt taste and a hint of chocolate from the cacao nibs. A tasty brown ale that seems like a nice fall to winter brew.","Illinois, USA","ChiGuy68"

2004,"2016-07-20",3.9,"This is really more of a porter by my reckoning and its good so I dont care. Its clear garnet brown w/ a long-lasting foamy head.Its mildly roasty w/ a touch of caramely malt sweetness to compliment. Its medium bodied and smooth on the palate w/ fairly moderate carbonation. It finishes w/ some coffee like bitterness and a hint of lingering sugar. I kinda wish this was a bit lower alcohol so II could drink more of it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

2004,"2016-04-22",3.7,"Dark brown with a small tan head. The aroma has some roasted malt, caramel and chocolate. The flavor adds some bitter cocoa on the finish that balances nicely with the full body sweetness. Not bad.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"
2004,"2016-03-16",4.3,"Taste: Cocoa nibs, dark malts, roasted kinda smokey notes. Super creamy mouth-feel.
Malt and cocoa nose.
Dark Brown and semi opaque in appearance, with a creamy head of lace on the glass.
The full body and chocolate notes paired well with the Chucks BBQ food we had when sampling this tasty Brown ale.
