4335,"2017-06-12",4.0,"Aroma e bogată, intensă, plăcută și dulce; un mix foarte reușit de multă caramelă, flori, fructe (caise/piersici) caramelizate, dulceață de fructe concentrată cu puțin alcool; totul pare un desert exotic/oriental foarte dulce.
Gustul e cumva mai redus din intensitate și concentrație, cu aceleași flori, caramelă, fructe caramelizate și dulceață din aceste fructe, adăugînd ceva amăreală, totul ușor și fin diluat cu alcool și căldură plăcută de alcool.

4335,"2017-06-03",3.9,"50 cl bottle served in Fullers shaker at Mad Bishop and Bear, Paddington station concourse. Pours clean dark copper orange to ruby red, tan long-lasting head (quite unusual for an English ale). Aroma is intense: rip banana, red berries, clove, cinnamon.

4335,"2017-05-28",3.9,"(500 ml bottle) Pours a clear deep ruby-mahogany beer, with fine steady carbonation, and a creamy off-white head. The aroma is malty, and full of fruit, with a delicate touch of English hops. Notes include: toffee, caramel, biscuit, spices, raisins, overripe plum, apricot kernel, elder flower, mineral water and oak. It tastes bittersweet, with a silky-smooth mouthfeel. On the palate, the beer develops vinous qualities, and is reminiscent of brandy. Considering the sheer quality of beer, and idiom in which it is brewed, this is a great example of English Strong Ale. Its beautifully blended, and you simply wouldnt think this is an 8.5% beer.","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","victorsampson96"

The aroma is very fine and ""luxurious"". Palate is pretty nice. Theres oiliness, but its not overwhelming, but balanced. Taste has sweet malt and surely its ""strong ale"". Additionally some (slightly burnt) caramel and cognac like aromas. Its tasty and the 8.5% alc vol gives it a solid body thats not weak.

4335,"2017-02-08",4.3,"Bottle, 500 ml. Pours clear, deep amber/red with a finger off off-white head. Patchy lacing, small amount of carb visible. Aroma is powerfully malty and fruity; wholemeal/farmhouse bread, honey, blood orange cointreau, cognac, cinnamon and various other spices, touch of vanilla and some faintly resinous hops right in the back. Hardly any booze. Taste is sweet but not sickly; again very malty with some dark fruits now coming through in the front along with molasses and dark, maybe spiced rum. Hints of an alcoholic, medicinal, but by no means harsh bitterness develops towards the back and lingers a while on the tongue and sides of the mouth in the long, wet finish, alongside plenty more cereal and bread. Body is full, texture is thick and oily and avoids becoming sticky or cloying, and as expected theres no real carbonation aside from a slight tingle occasionally. Warming after a few sips! Really fantastically crafted strong English ale that develops smoothly and subtly instead of just blasting you with sticky, sickly malt and booze from the get-go.

Carbonation thin and not very active. Its a touch shy of a good barley wine - a bit too thin and lacking boldness. Its, lets say, a somewhat mellow and lean for that (with all due respect).

4335,"2015-08-14",4.2,"Sweet malt aroma and a taste that is close up to English barley wine. Vinous is a little pronounced, but it has great flavor shades of soft fruits together with malt, characterizes towards a barley. The large group of beer that British denotes strong ales can vary very much in their expression. Therefore, it is almost impossible to set a standard for what is kind of right for strong ales. Fuller has once again branded English ale in a good way with this Golden Pride. It is simply its own and can not be compared with other strong ales. With elegant soft rounded aftertaste where little hoppy bitterness is present to maintain the good taste of summer berries far in the aftertaste, it is a fine ale. I can not get it expressed often enough, but have to say that if Fullers logo is on the label, you can confidently put it in the basket. Fuller is the provider of good quality beer, and it applies to everything that is brewed from there.","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"

Dear Fullers brewer - if you think gold looks like this then Im afraid you have been paid in copper pennies all this time. Aroma has sugar and some fruity English hops. Too sweet, Im already suspicious of the taste. Here it comes, the taste is overly sugary with medium level hoppiness and plenty of syrup. So sweet that it naturally covers all the booze and no wonder it creates an impression of a balanced brew to some. But its not. Mildly jammy finish. Perhaps five years in the cellar could add something to it if it wasnt pasteurised. But it is. Their Vintage Ales are so much more vibrant when cellared properly.

Bernsteinfarbenes Ale mit mittelprächtigem Schaum. Hopfig-würziges Aroma mit Alkoholfahne. Im Antrunk dann etwas overpowered, stark alkoholisch.

4335,"2012-09-09",3.8,"Bottle from the LCBO. Drink by date in July, drinking it in September - oops! Nice clear reddish-golden with a strong white head. Aroma is big and quite sweet - lots of toffee and lightly stewed peaches, some sweet orange peel and a bit of lightly toasted sugar. Body is full but not cloying. Flavour starts as sweet as the aroma suggests, with toffee/caramel and peach candy prominent, along with a bit of corn syrup and raisin bread, and even a hint of baked spiced apple. It dries out a bit toward the finish, which is moderately bitter, but I suspect the hops wouldve been a bit bigger and provided more balance when it was fresher. But even with some age on it, its a really pleasant beer that nicely straddles the line between strong ale and barley wine.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
4335,"2012-08-21",4.1,"Bottle (500ml from The Banker & The Barrow Boy, London):
Rich, dry malts with a mix of caramel and toffee straight away, this was quickly followed by a strong fruity aroma that lingered in the background and gradually became more pronounced. Some alcohol but the spiciness of the beer covered most of this. The aroma was a strong one with applea, pear and biscuit.

Rich look with a reddish copper appearance and topped with a white, half centimetre head that has a foamy texture and disappears quite fast.

A strong malt presence to start along with a taste of rich, creamy toffee and an accompanying caramel flavour. There is a fruity apple and pear taste too that is complimented by some spice and a linger, sweet taste of sugar.

Smooth with a medium to full body and a warming sensation when drank. The beer has a pleasant alcohol kick along with medium to low carbonation and a background sweetness.

An excellent beer and one that really packs a punch with a well hidden alcohol content for the most part and well balanced, complimentary flavours. A great beer for sipping away at.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

0.5L bottle Spirits&Wine, Spice, Riga
Beautiful and dangerously delicious brew. A bit more caramel flavor and body/alco - and it would be a barleywine. Gentle hopping level with enought malt sweetness to allow yeast produced fruity esters to shine. Pleasant, sweet, light caramel, candy like aroma with semisweet taste pattern. No long lasting aftertaste, a bit alcohol comes out at the end but mild sweetness and gentle, velvety texture is not suposed to be sipping brew, drinkability level- medium to high.

Intensely sweet, syrupy but well-made. Big flavors of molasses, palm syrup, overripe peaches and liquor. Boozy and heavy. When it warms, the sweetness becomes overwhelming. The hops are barely noticeable. Huge body, thick in the mouth. Finish is long and leaves a warm and boozy sensation in the mouth. As much a Barley Wine as an English Strong Ale.

4335,"2012-05-14",2.7,"500cc comprada en Jumbo Copiapó. 
Servida en un vaso English Pint. Hermosa cerveza de color ambar, clara y brillante, con espuma levemente tostada que desaparece rápidamente.
En nariz es bastante escurridiza y débil, sin notas de lúpulo y sólo algunas notas de complejidad a cera de abeja y algo de madera.
En boca se aconseja dejarla reposar y entregar todos sus sabores... no es para tragar rapidamente ya que se pierde mucho de la experiencia.
Notas claras de coñac o aguardiante en barrica, más alcoholica que amarga o dulce. A pesar de lo ""fuerte"" o alcoholica (8,5%) su cuerpo es medio a leve  y su final es sólo alcoholico.
Carbonatación nula a los pocos segundos tanto a la vista como en boca.
Es para tomar sola o con un buen puro cubano.

Looked good, a creamy coloured foaming head sat on top of a dark mahogany, clear body.

Toasted malts and rich molasses hit my nose, toffee and treacle but without a sweetness, more a prosperous, well-healed, confident air about it. In short, it smells like a rich persons tipple.

That richness carries on into the flavours, very oak wood rather than plywood, delicious, sumptuous and very moorish. I almost forgot it is 8.5%ABV, no wonder it tasted so full, warming and luxurious.

There are few beers in the world better than a well made English Strong Ale and this is up there with the best, I take my hat off to Fullers, this is one well crafted beer and well worth the extra couple of pence I paid for it.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

4335,"2011-11-28",4.3,"500ml bottle. Served at room temperature. Pours clear red gold and looks great. Head doesnt last long but thats ok. Smells awesome. Aroma is of something similar to sherry. Sweet and warm (spices), alcoholic, fruity and malty. Initial taste is smooth, well balanced, alcoholic, warming spices, sweet, fruity. Malty taste comes through with butterscotch or some kind of creamy caramel desert. I would pick this as a desert beer or it could easily compliment a dish which required a bit of smooth fruity sweetness. Good work. Drank this on a cold summers windy evening in Wellington. Almost 9pm and the sun is still out.","Auckland Central, NEW ZEALAND","Brodies_Best"
4335,"2011-11-23",3.6,"500 mL bottle from the LCBO, served in an English pint. Pours clear copper with a moderate off-white head. The head fades to a thin cover and leaves a moderate amount of fine lace. The nose has notes of citrus, caramel, pale malts, pine and earth. The flavour is moderately bitter throughout with pine and resinous hops. Hops are well balanced with toasted English malts and caramel. Peppery alcohol is a constant background presence. The finish is long and peppery with caramel malts and pine. On the palate, it is medium in body with a dryish milky texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent strong English ale. It is very well balanced, with beautiful malts and piney hops. An excellent brew. 2011-11-19","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

Flavour has more depth to it, with pale and chrystal malt backing up some semi-spicy hops. Alcoholic bite in the finish. Despite the strength and thicker body, it still has a creamy feel to it and goes down easily. I like how Fullers can produce beers at very high alcoholic percentages which you still want to pound away because of how delicious they are. Gets waaaaay better as it warms.

The first time it, of course, was very strong and strong in alcoholic content by the taste. Since then Ive had it many times and changed my opinion. But it has always been a good beer. The aromascape is full with malt accompanied by caramel, fruit, orange, alcohol, wood, cognac/whisky.. a very unique and somewhat mystic blend. The bitterness is extremely crispy and leveled, and the sweetness finishes of the taste with a tingle. The body is medium but feels really full in context. The texture is surprisingly thin in reality compared to what the entirety feels like with its fullness. A very, very good beer from Fullers.

The mouthfeel is really full, in the flavour, theres a big cookie-and-caramel-type sweetness, which is okay but bordering on becoming cloying - and thats an adjective I dont use inflationary. I mean, if you cant stand sweetness in a beer, you should probably avoid this. I thought it was actually a pretty decent sipper.

4335,"2010-05-11",4.1,"Bottle.

A - Coppery caramel brown with an average sized foamy white head. Really good retention, especially considering the ABV, that leaves a nice foamy layer of lacing.

S - Some caramel smelling malt serves as a springboard for golden fruit (particularly apple, but some pear too) and some floral and tea like hop aromas. A hint of honey in the background along with a hint of breadiness. Alcohol is just barely present.

T - Similar to the nose. Strong malt presences creates the base for this beer with a lot of caramel and bready flavors coming out. Interplaying with each other are golden fruit (apple, pear, golden raisin) and floral/tea hops. They wax and wane throughout the sip. Also present in the background is some honey, butterscotch, spiced, and nutty (more sweet than earthy) flavors.

M - Medium body with slightly above average carbonation. Pretty smooth.

D - Great drinkability. The alcohol is very well hidden and the flavors are well balanced and none of them overpower the others. Easy on the palate and pretty tasty (dangerously so for the ABV).

Notes: Best before 01/01/11. A solid beer that is a good example of an English Strong Ale. A touch on the sweet side, but it has enough to counterbalance that. Dangerously easy to drink given the ABV.

Plenty of malts in the nose, sweet chocolate and very light hop aromas. Dried fruits, raisins and quite prominent alcohol, almost solvent-like.

The taste is predominantly sweet. Bold juicy malt character with plenty of caramel notes. Some fruits and raisins. Brown sugar and sweet chocolate. Nutty flavors (almonds), hints of oak. Gentle floral hops and faint spices. The finish is surprisingly short, minimally bitter and is dominated by warming alcohol.

Full bodied, very smooth. Low levels of carbonation. The mouthfeel is actually the highlight of the beer.

A good beer, but nothing spectacular. Its slightly too focused on sweet flavors. The alcohol isnt really that overly prominent, but still it doesnt feel totally integrated with the other flavors. I liked it, but I think there are better strong ales out there.

4335,"2009-11-02",4.6,"50cl bottle, as shown. 

Pours a beautiful mahogany with a medium-sized, creamy off-white head with decent retention and plenty of lacing. 

Aroma is of dried fruit: raisins, some orange peel, plus caramel. 

Medium carbonation and a thick, creamy and oily mouth feel that, at 8.5 % abv, should surprise no one. A full-bodied strong ale, as Ive come to expect from Fullers.

Taste is of sweet roasted malt, toffee, stewed dark berries, with a lot of herbal spices adding to the complexity of this brew - again with a freshening note of orange peel. Malty, full, medium dry finish and gripping, slightly boozy after taste. Very similar to the much more expensive ""Vintage Ale"", which seems logical if that beer is indeed based on Golden Pride (same abv, to begin with). Unlike the ""Vintage"" variety, its pasteurized.

As with all the strong ales and premium esbs from Fullers, this one is beautifully balanced, with the strong alcohol well integrated into the intricate fabric of aromas. Sweetness and malty bitterness complement each other brilliantly, If youre searching for the perfect ""fireside brew"", look no further.","Offenbach, GERMANY","sound67"

After tasting one must again feel that alchol plays to large a part and that although it provides a pleasant, warming finish, the other flavours in this beer are simply not strong enough to compete.

Some caramel aroma and flavor; very moderate sweetness; ordinary bitterness, a bit of nutty touch. Not as rich as the bottle I remembered.2011-08-22, bottle, 7-5-7-3-13=35Beautiful, bright dark amber color, with generous creamy head. The aroma is malty but also simple, with nuts and tones of vegetables. Good body strength, with moderate sweetness; malt and caramel flavor, decent, unfortunately followed by some vegetables and alcohol; it ends with correct bitterness and a hint of nuts, also with alcohol warmth.Too much.2003-10-22, bottle, 8-4-8-4-16=40Amber color; poor head. Nice malt aroma, strong; wood, cellar. Warming, malty, loads of caramel; very good structure. Powerful. Of course not as much complex as the Vintage Ale, but I liked it","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
4335,"2003-10-19",2.0,"Clear redbrown color, medium/short head. Typical english malty hops aroma. Taste is heavy alcohol and sweet caramel malts, with an intense alcohol burn. I guess i better wait for an english beer with refermentation in the bottle, because this is just crap.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
4335,"2003-10-18",2.3,"Malty aroma. Brown coloured, nice head. Taste is alcoholic, sugar, malts, simple and cheap. Certainly not good.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"

Warm alcohol-aroma with sweet hoppiness.

A nice Barley Wine. Pale amber. Rich sweetish malty aroma and flavour. Notes of dried fruits, orange and perhaps rasin with a warming alcohol feel. Finishes with quite som bitterness, pleasant indeed.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"
4335,"2003-08-30",2.4,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2015 
Oct, 2003 A straight ahead, full on, heads down, high alcohol beer - a cousin of Carlsberg Special Brew. Interestingly, I have just learned that this is the pasteurised version of Fuller""s Vintage Ale! 
And again. It has a nice colour, but is the drink of tramps and winos. [2.3]
Oct, 2015 500ml dark bottle, filtered. Full bodied high alcohol beer of little subtly. Big dose of boiled hops add a dark edge. Rustic quality adds a little bit of interest. OK, but not really my thing. Too heavy with alcohol. [2.5]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
4335,"2003-07-26",4.4,"very very nice, a barley wine i think isn't it?  when it warms, the complexities of the flavor balance against the alcohol hit.  nice look too, easier to find in the skinny bottles.  worth a try, worth to be a regular","Rochester, New York, USA","EdPaulsen"
4335,"2003-05-22",2.2,"Bottled. Rusty, ginger colour, with a fine, fine head rising from the centre. Smells pleasant enough, with hop and malt aromas, tastes ok to start, slightly sweet and astringent but then....just as your starting to swallow, ethanol tares your mouth and palate to shreds leaving an unpleasant taste at the finish. Tastes like cheap European Strong ale. I'm agreeing with SilkTork on this one.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"
4335,"2003-05-19",3.6,"Fine appearance, amber and a big lacing head. Lots of sweetness in the aroma, and in the start of the flavor. The flavor finish with a bitterness. Overall a beer that really has aroma and flavor to the full.","Assentoft, DENMARK","Hansen"
4335,"2003-04-16",4.0,"An amber beer with a fine light orange head. The aroma is very nice malty sweet with notes of fruit, wood, and spices. The flavor is sweet and strong coming from a great maltblend and with lots of spice notes. It has a great palate and is a great beer - but beware You'll get drunk drinking it in the afternoon.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

4335,"2002-12-19",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2005 A big, high alcohol sort of cross between 1845 and London Pride ... with a knockout punch.   I prefer the 1845, which is darker, in some ways maltier, and hey, less alcohol is good when youre talking about anything over 8 %!  // Rerated 3 November 2005.  Not much change in my reaction.  Definitely a close cousin to the vintage ale, not as closely related to the 1845.  I find the flavor not nearly as integrated or balanced as the vintage ale ... the individual flavors ... malt, hops, and alcohol ... are separate rather than woven together.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
4335,"2002-10-25",4.1,"great barleywine.
hazy orange color, fluffy head.  malt and fruits in the aroma.
big malty base with a niuce complexity. strong and warming stuff.
Hsad this at Fullers brewery and the guide said that many fullers employees liked to blend the golden pride with the Chiswick bitter. this was a very nice combination indeed.","Bombay, INDIA","ravidesai"
4335,"2002-08-20",3.3,"more like a doppelbock than an english strong. big, sticky and malty, with a touch of grapefruit, pineapple and spice from the hops lurking in the background. very pretty red colour with nice offwhite head. balanced, yes. interesting, no.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"

4335,"2002-06-19",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2005 Original Rating: My least favourite Fullers beer. Far too strong, and really sweet. (1.2/5)

Rerating: Years on, I have now developed a taste for bigger beers. Prickly on the tongue, some fruit and plenty of malt. Its doesnt seem great, but its not as bad as I once thought. 

Rerating: Tried it again, its not great and it has a certain boiled taste, but its nice and fruity and easy to drink. Tasty.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Joeh"
4335,"2002-05-31",4.3,"Golden, like it says on the label.  This has a vinuous and spicy aroma.  Flavours are of brown sugar, burnt toffee and a surpising hops bites.  Powerful and delicous.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
4335,"2002-05-05",4.0,"Creamy light-brown weak head. Light amber-copper color. Aroma is superb rich of honey, orange peel and cloves notes. Flavour is sweet, malty and velvet, slighly vanilla and balance so well high alcohol content. Finish is moderately bitter.","Tuscany, ITALY","The Etruscan"
4335,"2002-04-22",4.4,"A lovely golden colour, with just the right amount of carbonation.  To me, this is how beer should look.  Smells great too.  It didnt taste at all as i expected,  as its slight sweetness combines superbly with its depth and strength.  You wouldnt drink gallons of it, but its taste is absolutley fantastic.","Leicestershire, ENGLAND","neilrichards"

4335,"2002-02-17",3.2,"Deep golden-orange colour, pours with little head.  Alcohol and butterscotch aroma and a flavour to match.

When I finally opened it, the beer was badly oxidized. It had the balance of a good, big beer. But it was too far gone to really tell what it could have been.","Livermore, California, USA","Davidw987"
