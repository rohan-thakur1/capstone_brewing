Flavor is big and malty up front. Lots of grainy, fairly sweet caramels and bready, cereal malts. A nice grassy hop, a few nuts, a light banana ester, and some raisins/dark fruits follow before the initial sweetness mellows nicely and this dries with a pleasant, light bitterness. Still finishes with a good amount of grainy, cereal malts that keeps the focus on the malty sweetness, but the hops really transition this nicely and keep it far from cloying or overly sweet. Lengthy aftertaste following a very smooth, medium body and moderate carbonation. I like how this didnt get too full in body. Overall, a really nice eisbock.

Pours into my German dimpled mug a light brown/orange/red with bubbly quicly dissipating white head.

Smell is metallic, fruity, malty.

Mouthfeel is smooth and almost creamy. Te flavor is like a normal bock, not even a double bock, certainly not an eisbock. It is the beginners Eisbock. There isnt much going on, the alcohol is the only flavor really with a pinch of malt.

I did a tasting with 4 eisbocks, Kuhnhenn Raspberry, Aventinus, and Kulmbacher, this one fell behind. It just doesnt do much unfortunately. I might be extra critical because this is my favorite style but I would compare this to a Salvator-light with no depth of flavor and a bit more alcohol.

4467,"2010-04-13",3.5,"Eisbock is one of the rarest beer styles due to the expense of producing them and there are only a few examples where you really get to taste the difference between the original beer and the iced version such as you do w/ Autumnal Fire and Eisphyre. Now, Autumnal Fire, is a very fine dopplebock. Its not quite traditional but it is true to the style in spirit w/ very vibrant malty notes. I enjoy it anyway. Eisphyre is similarly good but if anything the icing is a lateral move rather than strictly an improvement. Nice browninsh read color, lasting white head of medium bubbles that leaves lace behind in patchy sheets. Fresh malty nose and flavor which is balanced and just slightly boozy. I am not sure if the malt character here doesnt lose something in the icing process but, to be sure, the mouthfeel is absolutely wonderful, creamy w/ very fine carbonation. On the sweet side but not at all stick. Lovely malt-centric brew and an interesting experience.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Also a dark nut - walnut sort of element in back. Rich and full nose. Taste is big right away, just a malt bomb. Big grain cereal caramel malt and nutty sweetness, followed by banana yeast esters, along with the drying grass and straw to the finish. The booziness is evident, though more in a chest warming rather than alcohol hotness sort of way. Palate is medium, not as heavy as expected. Lowish carbonation and an oily mouth feel makes this both a touch syrupy and drying at the same time.

The flavor followed suit, slight toasty notes, strong doughy and candy notes also present with a slightly resinous finish. This was a malt bomb, as would be expected, but it was a bit too cloying. The most impressive aspect of this beer was its hiding of the heat, as I was really questioning while drinking weather it was really an eisbock as the title led me to believe: 10pct ABV?

4467,"2008-08-28",3.8,"My 30th Birthday! 
8/28/2008:  Ive held on to this bottle for long enough and think that my 30th birthday is just as good of time as any to finally drink it.  Happy Birthday to me!  ...  Eisphyre has a really deep and intense aroma of rich caramel, golden raisins, subtle dried apple fruit leather, and a touch of sweet alcohol.  It appears to be pretty thick judged by judging the pour and there is a pretty low level or carbonation.  The beer has a color that I can only describe as dirty golden (my wife says it is ""peach-colored"") and is hazy with hardly any veil on the surface.  The flavor is toward the sweeter end of the spectrum but its kept in check by a pronounced earthy/lightly floral bitterness in the semi-dry finish.  The prevailing flavor is the caramel and toffee maltiness which is followed by some dark fruity notes and warming alcohol (dry sherry-like).  This beer has a medium to medium-full body and is quite smooth and easy to drink considering the alcohol content.  Overall this is a pretty solid Eisbock, but to be honest, I was actually expecting more based on many of the previous ratings and other discussions that I have heard about this beer...   UPDATE (later this evening):  After letting the this beer sit and warm up a bit, it has definitely started to open up.  The malt seems to deepen with a roasty edge to it and even a hint of smoke/char and the body seems to thicken and stick to the palate more.  It also seems to be stronger, yet the expected alcohol bite/burn is still held well in check.  I am amazed by how smooth this beer is.  It’s almost too smooth...

4467,"2008-02-16",3.8,"Pours with a frothy, initially two-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a reddish tinged, deep amber color and shows a brilliantly clear, bright cranberry color when held up to the light.  The aroma has an immensely rich, concentrated malt aroma to it that seems just characteristic of a Bock.  Bready malt notes, sweetly complex grain, green raisins, ample biscuit notes and huge, caramelized, toffee-like malt notes.  The alcohol notes are hidden quite well.  As the beer warms up the nose starts to suggest at the age of this beer; lightly oxidized with some Sherry notes noticed if you dig around for them.

Sweet tasting, but amply rich enough that it is not cloying.  Thick, viscous, chewy, this beer is a meal in a glass; the beer coats the mouth and palate with a velvety texture that is just lightly offset by a medium-full carbonation.  The alcohol is noticeable at times in the finish, yet it is pretty darn smooth for such a big beer.  The rich, clean malt character is big enough that it evokes thoughts of fruit, despite this being a clean lager, hints of cherries, green raisins and maybe something like dried figs.  There is a noticeable hop character here as well with a soft herbal note that runs through the middle and lingers on in the finish for quite some time with a soft hop-bitterness.  The hop character is actually pretty pronounced for a Bock / Eisbock, but adds a nice dimension and balance to the dominant malt character.  As the beer warms up it picks up suggestions of vanilla, flavors of toffee and a bit more of a vinous quality.

Quite a tasty brew and most definitely a fitting way to close out the night.  Not one of those beers that wows me with its greatness, but this is a very good beer; a mellow beer that is just about perfect for those cold, slow nights spent in front of the fire with a good book.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
4467,"2008-02-04",4.7,"Holy balls is this good!!! But not for the faint-of-heart. This packs a punch. 
On tap in the Horse & Plow in Kohler, WI. 
Poured into a snifter a dark copper body with a great tan head that quickly disappears leaving a good lacing. Sweet malty nose. Great alcohol aromas loft with malty sweetness of dark fruits and spices. Almost smells like a Barley wine. Taste is phenomenal. Maltiness and alcohol is very present at the first sip. Not overpoweringly sweet like I was afraid it might have been. The true character of the Autumnal Fire is not lost in this offspring. Thick and chewy mouth feel. It coats your mouth like a cough medicine would- but in a good way. Slight alcohol burn down the throat, but mild for an 11% beer. One serving of this is plenty. Great beer to finish the night on. Very impressed, especially since I was afraid it would be too sweet. Highly recommended!!","Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, USA","jj21"
4467,"2007-12-28",3.8,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Courtesy of arjoseph.  Mostly transparent, ruddy amber pour with a frothy head of ivory.  Light fruit nose with edges of honey and caramel malt sweetness.  Sherried green raisins, anjou pears, and melon liquore provide an intriguing apertif aromatic dimension.  Medium full bodied, tightly carbonated mouthfeel.  Sweet toffee malts, caramel, maple syrup, and butter rum candy create a rich, thick elixir that coats the palate richly.  Hints of the fruity dimension from the nose transfers lightly to the palate, but the sweet malt characters dominate.  Alcohol well hidden.

4467,"2007-06-13",3.6,"Cloudy glowing orange topped by a long lasting small off-white head.  Nose is rather boring but the taste is very characteristic of what I know of the Eisbock style.  Smooth body, creamy spicy fruity caramel.  Alcohol remains mostly well hidden.  Im not usually found of the genre but this one had something that resembled foresty hops in the finish mixed rather well with the rest of the beer.  Nice beer.  Brewed last year as a 20th anniversary beer.  Impressive milestone.  For those who were there at the opening party, got hammered and didnt use protection, you can now legally drink their anniversary beer with your kid.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4467,"2007-06-11",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
This Eisbocks chewy mouthfeel benefits from a lucrative caramel maltiness and an apple taffee fruitiness. Alcohol warns and warms up the sipper; this is one for your deepest couch.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the hazy amber-red.
-Discreet herbal hops dont achieve balance, but I dont believe that was their purpose anyway.
-Freshly-crushed grain is always a pleasure to perceive.
-The fruitiness is quite complex and seamlessly blends in with the malty sweetness.

Fairly assertive attack, though not crazily so; syrupy body, light tingle of carb, and swimming with malt sugar flavors. Booze is fairly well hidden, considering.

From the carbonation within, a creamy light beige head forms, swirls of mustard yellow seem to hold the silken froth together. The body is spectacularly clear and dense at once. Aromas of alcohol soaked tangelos, sticky and pulpy apricot nectar, caramel. Light pineapple and cedar notes mingle with vanilla and woody notes. Alcohol is profuse, but blends nicely with the fruit. More sugary and less malty of an aroma than expected, knowing the style in advance. These differences dont seem like faults, rather exciting developments. Flavor is chock full of cereal grains, abundant caramel and toffee, little else at first. Eventually fruit notes proceed forward with unripened characteristics. A welcome addition in the flavor is the departure of most of the alcohol presence. Moderate sweetness and light astringency balance each other out. Lightly bitter and fully toasted as well. Finishes with a dusty sweetness, then dries out; medium length, moderate warmth. Mouthfeel is slick, medium-full bodied, amply carbonated. Pretty good.

4467,"2006-09-25",4.2,"Firey dark orange. Big frothy top of fluffy tannish foam thats unlasting to the point of a mere minute, if that. Keeps a solid collar present and laces the glass in thick stings and some spots.

Aroma is super plump and inviting with a malt display that equals most of Capitals bigger bock beers. Ample red apple, some soaking dark cherry, mild melon, toffee, and berries. All swirling about with a rich dullness like that of fruit salad spritz with a bit of ethonalic heat.

Mild taste without as much complexity as the nose but has lasting malt flavors sinking in slowly as it tends to get deeper and richer towards the finish. Among the maltyness is some favorable toffee soaked breadyness mixed with dark fruityness of cherry, molasses, dates, and a touch of nuttyness and rounded off candied melon in the close. 

Feel is bold, big, and malty. Rich tones of malt grabbing smoothness with a sliding little thick stickyness to its girth. Alcohol is hardly evident as it glides right down with ease. Just a pinch of carbonation on the tongue towards the front end and mellows from there with the malts making their way across the palate.

A solid effort by Capital; right up there with most of their other big bock beers.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Nice racing; lacing is a somewhat sticky, glittering sheet that crumbles after a slight pause.  Smells like fermenting sourdough bread with La Chouffe-ish yeast qualities (some creamy banana and a bit of melony fruits), but this is mostly bready.  Very malty in the mouth, maibock-ish corn flavors with dark burnt grains hiding a little bit of fruit.  Also, I was reminded of butternut squash, although I havent had it in a while; the impression was sweet in a wholesome, non-sugary way.  Alcohol burn late in the finish, which was mealy and tangy with hops before transitioning into the alcohol and hops dry bitterness.

Carbonation and body are fairly soft. First sip is sharply alcoholic, but not oppressively so. Rich husky Munich allays the sweetness by lending a toasted-biscuit element. Alcohol becomes more distant as lush layers of breadiness extinguish its spicy tendencies. Finishes silky soft and nuanced with baked apples resting in a bed of powdery and bready Munich malt. Doesnt quite have the level of complexity one might expect, but its rather bright and clean, and the alcohol is masked quite well.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4467,"2006-06-11",4.1,"12oz bottle.Im already a big fan of Autumnal Fire -- and the rest of Capitals doppelbock line for that matter. They are, in my estimation, among the best standard-priced ""non-specialty"" beers in the craft-brewing business. There wasnt much room for improvement to begin with, and the eisbock process didnt add much to the net result. But, the small bit of improvement it did bring about is quite welcome. The Eisphyre is pours a beautiful copper with a half-finger of off-white head that settles quickly and leaves small bits of lacing. Aroma is surprisingly faint for a beer this big but it reveals huge caramel malt and a slight herbal kick suggesting anise. Hops are about non-existent. Flavor is also huge sweet malty caramel, hops are modest and spicy with a tiny hint of licorice, and the alcohol makes an appearance as well, though it is always soothing and complementary rather than harsh and intrusive. A great big thick palate laced with a surprise showing of modest but noticeable hop bitterness rounds off each mouthful. Yes, this is a great beer made even greater, but I might just as soon drink the original Autumnal (or any other Capital doppel) at about half the price. Every Capital product I drink for the first time does nothing but increase my affection for this top-notch brewery.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Malty, sweet, and hoppy spice come through in the aroma.  Flavor is very sweet with a long alcohol buuuuuurn.  Slick body, which is nice.  Nice little treat.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"

4467,"2006-04-30",3.8,"Poured a copper color with a small, off white head that left spotty lacing on the glass.  Aroma of sweet honey, grains, light smoke, dough, spicy clove, with light citrus and some alcohol as well.  Taste was sweet and malty, with nuts, and more dough, with a dry, black pepper, alcohol finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
4467,"2006-04-30",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2008 Thanks Nate!  The beer pours to a very bright glowing dark amber body.  Nice white head but it dissipated rather quickly.  The aroma is hoppy, grainy, floral and grassy hops.  The flavor is malty, subtle noble hops, light floralness.  The palate is richly thick and creamy.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4467,"2006-04-30",3.7,"Growler:  Courtesy of Hezron at the Hampton Inn Tasting (Saturday).  Lots of alcohol in the aroma.  Based on aroma alone, Im amazed this is only 10%.  Hints of sweet caramel and some grassy hops behind all the alcohol in the nose.  Pours a bright transparent orange with a minimal head.  Sweet caramel, fruit, and a hint of toffee.  Finishes with moderate alcohol flavor, but not getting a lot of warmth.  Faint bitterness in the finish as well.  Gets a tad sweeter the more I drink.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
4467,"2006-04-29",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2006 (Re-Rate/Bottle) Growler- Thanks to Hezron. Pours a rich dark red color, White fluffy head. Aroma is Sweet malts, cherries and cranberries. Flavor is boozy. Alcohol is not hidden well. Goes in like an eisbock. Goes out like an eisbock. Slightly metallic finish.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
4467,"2006-04-07",4.3,"Tap.  As purty as a brew gets with a deep bronze color and a equally red-bronze head.  Fine lace for a >dopple.  Full molasses/honey/toffee/treacle/caramel/malty aroma that even rose above the whoompf of alcohol esters that hits before the beer touches your lips.  Creamy smooth in the mouth, rolls like a pig in mud.  A happy beer.  A fine brew, lots of love in thisn.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","jewedekind"
4467,"2006-04-03",4.5,"On tap at Capital.  Transparent copper-bronze in color with rising carbonation and a persistently creamy-off-white head thats 1/3"" thick and complimented by blanketing marshmallow lacing.  Buttery caramel, brown sugar glazed nut shavings and sweet maple fudge wafts grace the nose.  Further aromatic sentiments reveal whole wheat brown bread, cinnamon sprinkled grahams, butterscotch and toffee soaked barley bags.  Take a sip, wait two seconds, and now meet glory.  Sweet spiced pecans and black peppercorns bring a nutty semblance with a prominent noble hop performance for a bitter accentuation.  Liquefied brown sugar smoothes out with a whole wheat brown bread mentality and totality.  Spicy, titillating pecans think to impose syrupy characteristics, but spawn a balanced them in summation.  Caramelized prunes and baked golden raisins.  Full-flavored and balanced beyond expectations.  Bitter hop bite strikes center tongue but transpires to traits of cackled white pepper while alcohol tickles the tonsils hanging.  Cocoa-laced apple butter helps to segway unto the finish, annotated by cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper.  Complexity is the key here - and Capital is to be commended.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Thanks to hezron and malachi for giving me the heads up on this one.  Stopped by Capital while running errands to try this potent brew.  Thankfully I had just eaten because it is very strong - 11% according to the bartenders.  The aroma doesnt give away - caramel, a subtle nuttiness and a hint of wheat.  The appearance is spot on though - opaque and carbonated with a one-finger head that refused to go away.  The taste is where it begins to shine.  You can detect the base of Autumnal Fire but in addition there is this sweet caramel like flavor that is remininscent of a barley wine.  Also included after that dies down are hints of wheat.  Very creamy and easy to drink, this one could get you in alot of trouble if you arent careful.  Apparently they only wanted to extract 25% of the water from Autumnal Fire but ended up with 40% less water.  I cant wait to try the bottled version to see how it compares.  If it is anything like the one on tap, this is one of the best beers to come out of Wisconsin.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4467,"2006-03-31",4.0,"On tap at Capital.  Deep amber red/orange pour.  Huge head which diminishes slowly and leaves a nice lacing.  Weak, sour grass aroma.  The alcohol flavor increases as the body warms and it leaves a nice subtle chocolate coating on the throat.  Slight maltiness and bitterness comes out late in the body.  Extra creamy and smooth character sets this lager apart from Capitals other lagers.  A very nice find by Hezron.  Cant wait to compare this with the bottled version coming out in May.","Seattle, Washington, USA","malachi"
4467,"2006-03-29",4.1,"Sampled on tap at the brewery.  The aroma is fairly soft, with caramel and some nutty malt with a hint of grassiness and some minerals.  Not as strong as I expected, but it gets better as it warms.  Deep amber-red in color with a thick and creamy, off-white head that lasts with great lacing.  Flavor has lots of sweet, chewy caramel and toffee followed by some chocolate and a hint of cherries.  As it warms up there are lots of complex malty dried fruit notes that show up in the finish.  The mouthfeel is amazing, it coats your mouth with a thick, velvety feal that is just amazing.  My only complaint is that the aroma was a little weak.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
