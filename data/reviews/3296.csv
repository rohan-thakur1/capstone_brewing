3296,"2017-06-18",4.3,"12 oz. bottle. Slightly hazy golden body. Smells of sourdough bread, grassy hops, and a slight green apple fruitiness. Tastes of grassy hops up front, a touch of grain behind it that turns into doughy malt flavors. Back end is just a little yeasty with an almost tangy bite, again reminiscent of that sourdough aroma. Finishes with lingering doughy sweetness and spicy hop bitterness after the tang dies down. Light body. I am certainly no expert on this style, but this seems to be pretty damned good.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3296,"2017-05-31",4.0,"2017 version. Pours a hazy golden yellow from the bottle with bubbly white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of nice pilsner malt and grassy earthy hops. Taste follows, biscuit malt and grassy back end, with a clean creamy mouth. This might be one of the best lagers Ive ever had.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
3296,"2017-05-28",4.6,"[ Keg ][ 16oz ][ New Glarus ][ $8 ][ NG Pilsner Flute ][ 10.18.16 ]
>> For my 10,000th beer review, I wanted to skip through some of my backlog and post my favorite beer from 2016. New Glarus revived their Zwickel for 2016 and I just so happened to be in Wisconsin and dropped in - what a nice surprise! This was available on tap at the brewery and also to go in 6-packs only at the brewery - no retail distribution. For the side of me that is pilsner/German lager obsessed, NGs Zwickel absolutely nailed it. This is a perfect looking beer in the NG pilsner flute glass: crystal clear golden with ferocious, champagne-like bubbles that never end. The beer is topped by a lasting, meringue white foam. The nose is fresh bread, lemon, and grassy hops. Nothing crazy, but the malt character is perfect. In flavor, this is rich and bready with perfect buoyancy from the high carbonation. The palate is juicy, silky, and super smooth. Thick breadiness piles on and goes a bit lactic in the backend like good sourdough. There is just a touch of sugar and apple sauce. Really, nothing says hoppy in the taste, but the balancing character is there. Its a simple, soft, quenching beer that has a lot of finesse. Maybe its something about drinking this outside in NGs gorgeous Swiss Village/Disneyland-looking immaculate space. I took this beer with me on a little walk through the woods on their trails. Sitting under the trees with chipmunks scurrying around - it was a perfect day.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3296,"2017-01-20",4.4,"Pours a hazy straw yellow into New Glarus dimple mug. Apparently this is sold only at New Glarus brewery. Must only be made in small batches. Great biscuits and crackery flavor with a spicy hop profile. Fresh and complex. A yeasty finish with some lemon. Easily one of the best lagers I have ever tried. Surprised they dont feature this as one of the brewerys staple beers.","Elk Grove Village, Illinois, USA","chicagobears"
3296,"2017-01-15",3.6,"Very pleasant aroma yeasty dough like and bread bakery hints. appearance pale, golden, slightly hazy, with a minimal white head. taste meadium sweet not bitter at all a light tasting beer. On the palate medium creamy texture with an average carbonation with a long finish. This looks like but is not your average beer. You can tell it is well crafted. Can only be bought at the brewery itself and is a limited addition.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","dutch23mp"
3296,"2016-11-01",3.2,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a clean gold with white head. Faint aroma of straw and grains. Taste is mildly sweet with no bitterness. Flavors of crackers, straw, grains. Very sessionable and crisp. Quite nice.

3296,"2016-08-16",3.7,"12 oz. bottle via trade. Pours a clear gold with a small fizzy white head that settles into a ring that lasts all the way down. Clean and crisp at the start, especially when colder, with straw, cracker, grass, earth, cereal - the Munich malts shine through, with a decent hop snap and some malty and light fruity sweetness. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a malty, sweet, but refreshing mouthfeel. Good Zwickel.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3296,"2016-08-15",3.2,"12oz bottle from the local grocery. Pale golden colored pour with a bit of a white head. Aroma has yeast, light straw, some lemon, some biscuit. A touch floral. Taste has light sweet malts, lemon, some doughy-ness. Light to medium bodied. No real alcohol presence. The blend is ok, and the carbonation is constant. Finishes light and short.

My dumm nephew left his computer open with all his passwords & stuff & so Im going to go see what all this beer rating crap is all about. Jee-zus! You people should oughta get lives! I found out this here beer cost 72 bucks and the fool had to drive an hour to get it, kids 50 year old he should know better by now. Anyhow I guess its pretty good but I can get about 5 30-packs of Keystone for the same price. Enjoy your hobby losers!

Muzzle sez: 

Case of bottles from the brewery. This one sampled 10 minutes out of the fridge in a New Glarus pils glass. Faintly hazy, almost ""greasy"" pale amber, largish frothy head diminishes moderately slowly to a bit of lasting ring. Very fresh and deep grassy aroma; simple but hugely enticing, this is the essence of a summer lager to me. Outstanding grainy/bready flavor, with just a subtle hint of honey sweetness, light to medium mouthfeel and a brief kiss of lasting dry hoppiness to finish. While its not a hugely complex beer overall, one is left with a very long, lingering enticement to further bottles, and future endeavors from one of Americas great breweries.

3296,"2016-05-12",3.6,"12 Oz bottle acquired from The Hilltop Brewery (New Glarus, WI). Glad to grab some of these. Pours a lively dulled golden harvest hue, pretty glow and lively cascading bubbles flow through. Bright white crown on head sits atop, full layer retains and laces well. Aromas show a crisp, cleaner appeal. Bready malts, straw, subtle grass. A faint waft of fruit is subtle. Light, clean, a bit fuzzy and lively. Initial is lighter bodied, gentle bready appeal, smooth and almost a bit creamy. Gentle fruity wafts, earthy hops and mellow yeastiness. Clean and smooth, this one goes down easy. Cereal, bread, some earthiness, a tangy appeal and just enough bitterness into the back. That tangy fruit and yeasty appeal is pleasant. Quite an easy one to put back. Pretty pour, smooth mellow nose. Cleaner and smooth flavors, fresh and subtle sweet and spicy appeal as we flow through. Really simple yet expert stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3296,"2016-05-03",4.1,"Picked up a six pack at the brewery in New Glarus, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden straw colored brew with a creamy white head that has excellent retention and lacing. Aroma of floral hops, golden grain malt, a hint of white bread and touch of angel food cake. Taste is medium bodied with a rich golden malt flavor, noble floral and light grassy hops with some lager yeast. Finish is semi-sweet, a short mild bitterness with rich golden malt and lager yeast aftertaste. For a second I thought this was a revived New Glarus historical beer (Zweifel) but it spelling is different.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

Wow, who would have thought that such a simple Low-alcohol beer could be rated this high? yes, this guy can! Pours golden yellow hue a pinch darker than an american standard with a nice whipsy white head and sparse ghostly lacing. nose is grainy, slightly sweet, grassy. perfect for the style. Flavors exhibit the grains and pale malts here. palate is slick, full and just perfect for this kind of beer.

Only needs a little bit of yeasty haze to be perfect.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
3296,"2016-03-30",4.2,"Bottle - One of my big sads is not being around and into beer when New Glarus made their first Zwickel. I was around, thankfully, for the R&D incarnation, which was a glorious beer that kicked me in the nuts, then held me tenderly as I whimpered in pain, caressing me with is soft Noble hops and rustic graininess. I still dream about that beer. This pale yellow number comes close, with its pillowy white head, grainy sweetness, and all that soft floral Noble hoppiness that I yearn for. Hot damn--that smell is just so fine. The taste gets a little muddled, with the grain and hops commingling to produce a little bitterness that isnt what Im looking for in this style. The finish saves it somewhat, coming back with that sticky graininess and a dusty yeastiness. The pale malts just stick in the back of your mouth for awhile, letting you enjoy the beer long after it goes down the hatch. Lovely body, with fluffy carbonation that bites a bit, but compliments the light body. Looks like this guy is going to have to go down to the Beer Depot and pray this is still there.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
