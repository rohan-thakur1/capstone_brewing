Maybe 3 of 10 sour. Has a Berliner weisse feel to it but more body and more complex flavors. This one is quite good. Refreshing and light but with great flavor and a nice sourness. A bit of a funky bitter finish that is odd, but overall very good. And impressive amount of flavor for a 3.6 abv beer.

958,"2015-03-27",4.3,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like lemon peel, funk, hay, lime, bready/grainy malt, and some earthiness. The taste is somewhat similar to the aroma, but theres also the addition of some tropical fruit, peppery spice, peach, mango and a bit of vinegar noticeable. Its funky, tart and sweet all at the same time. Mouthfeel/body is light, its crisp and refreshing! Well carbonated, but also easy to drink. Ive liked the few Crooked Stave beers that Ive tried so far, but this one might be the best. I know Ill pick this up again if I ever find another bottle! $10.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

958,"2014-12-22",3.6,"8 ounce pour - $8.00 at Argosy in Atlanta, Georgia.

Appearance: Intrinsically hazed, soft pale yellow body with no real head formation.

Smell: Theres just a very slender maltiness, leaving a predominately citrusy, tart aroma atop a little light, tame funkiness of the Brett.

Taste: As evidenced by the nose, theres no more than a slim malt character with only a tiny hint of sweetness. Tart and lemony, yes, but also some lime showing more bitterness than expected along with a flash of acidity. Sourish, citrusy finish.

Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Lightly carbonated.
