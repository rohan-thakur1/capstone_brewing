4591,"2017-04-28",3.4,"I have been fortunate enough to personally meet founder Rob Tod and a few other Allagash people in Flanders years ago and I remember asking them about this beer, which at that point was the only one I knew of. Thanks to their love for Belgian beer culture, I had the opportunity to sample several of their creations throughout the years, but this one somehow had always escaped me so far, so Im glad I found a bottle now to submit to a tasting session. Medium thick, moussy, egg-white head, dissolving in the middle but leaving a dense, regularly shaped rim in the end, over a yellow blonde beer with greenish hue, slightly hazy at first (I did not rouse the yeast from the bottom first, contrary to the recommendations on the label) but becoming an equally misty, more ochre-tinged straw blonde with sediment. Aroma of soapy wheat of course, reinforced by soapy coriander, almost bath foam-like, but also hints of lime zest, banana, lemongrass, green apple, lots of gooseberry, sourdough, mashed potato, pear, straw, cloves and even very, very vague aniseed somewhere. Fruity onset, banana ester but mildly so, balanced with a hint of pear and a whole lot of green gooseberry, starfruit and slightly rhubarb-like sourishness, reinforced by the wheat sourishness below, which continues all the way to the finish, in a somewhat sharper, more vivid way than is the case in many actual Belgian witbieren. Carbonation is on the soft side, mouthfeel is fluffy and gentle, gliding over the tongue without any effort, enhancing the thirst-quenching properties of this beer. The sourish wheat gains an expectedly soapy quality in the middle, paired with sourdough-like barley; a bready note is there too, adding softness. Soapy coriander seed rises up in the finish, alongside citrus rind-sensations which add further fraîcheur, almost lime peel-like; way below, a soft and earthy, behind-the-curtains hop bitterness brings structure and welcoming dryness to the tail - and eventually even a brief moment of explicit herbal bitterness on the root of the tongue. It lingers a bit after swallowing, but the lovely bready yeast flavours, wheat soapiness and elegant spicing stay behind longer. Very Belgian indeed: it has the soapy wheat character, softness, thirst-quenching properties and expressive coriander spicing of any typical Hoegaarden epigone, but in a most elegant way; it is safe to say that this far surpasses the highly industrialized original of course, but it can just as well stand comparison with the best of the classic Belgian wits made by traditional family breweries in the range of Sint-Bernardus, Roman or Bavik, and easily so. I especially like the somewhat more outspoken sourish component and the volatile, gracile lemon rind-like qualities in the nose, adequately conveying the light, refreshing character of this old beer style. Witbier will never be my preferred style - within the classic European wheat beer family, I tend to lean much more towards German Weissbier, (originally) eccentricities like Gose and Berliner Weisse aside - but when I come to think of it, this must be one of the more pleasant and refined examples I had so far. Worthy of its reputation and I guess this functions well as an introduction to the style for the American consumer - in any case to be recommended way over Hoegaarden.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Appearance: Pours a quite cloudy pale straw gold, and forms a massive white head with good retention. Lacing was exceptional throughout.

Smell: Musty wheat mixed with a bouquet of light fruits, from pear to lemon-orange citrus. Some hints of spiciness lurk within the depths of the aroma.

Taste: Spices hit straightaway, coriander, clove, and white pepper, before receding a touch to let fruit esters swirl in. Waves of white grapes, pears, and a mildly tart citrus bearing hints of orange and lemon hit and mingle. A faint tone of bubblegum arises towards the finish, which leaves a lingering tart citrus and peppery spice aftertaste.

Taste: There isnt much to say about Allagash White that hasnt been said about a lot of other witbiers. Its one of the better American examples of the style as its tasty, robust, well-balanced and highly drinkable. This is exactly what I expect in a witbier. 

Just like the aroma, the flavor here is a sweet and spicy mixture of orange citrus and light peppery notes. A clean, refreshing taste across the tongue with hints of lemonade or orange juice, but without any tartness or acidic character. The finish imparts subtle clove or black pepper seasonings. Not much in the way of bitterness or specific hop character, though thats fine because this is exactly to the style specifications. Its satisfying to be sure, though I cant help but wish it was a little bit more robust.

Drinkability: Allagash White is so damn refreshing it almost seems to do it a disservice drinking it in colder weather. The mouthfeel is rather full and energetic for what is technically a smaller bodied beer. Refreshing and crisp with a clean aftertaste - its difficult to not quaff it all down at once. At only 5.1% ABV its tempting to throw back several of these in a row.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

4591,"2012-02-16",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2012 Poured from a bottle into a stange.  From notes.  First reviewed 12/2/208.

Following the directions on the bottle: Pour, swirl, and add yeast. Very pale and cloudy yellow, with a strong head that hangs around and leaves a nice lace on the glass.

A strong and soothing aroma of spices and citrus, particularly nutmeg, cinnamon, and orange peel. 

The flavor is bold for a witbier, first the nutmeg and cinnamon control my palate, combining with the yeast to form a unique flavor. The malt slowly comes out along with the citrus flavors, adding a nice complexity to the flavor.  The complex flavors make this a beer worth savoring, but it is also light and refreshing.

Initially it is very crisp; the strong carbonation is the first thing I notice. The wheat and yeast allow it to be very smooth as well.

Aroma:  Quite yeasty in a way that I havent smelled before, some nice zesty citrus and spiciness, sort of a thick, brothy note but in a wheat ale kind of way (hard to describe), a hint of organic acids, some esters comes out as it warms, the earthy/lemony coriander comes out as it warms too, a nice Wit.
  
Palate:  Medium body, fairly full and velvety effervescence.

4591,"2011-02-21",3.7,"12 oz bottle.

Pours into my Hoegaarden glass with a small foamy white head. The body is urine/pineapple juice colored.

The nose is a bit citrusy, with the prescience of orange and coriander. Nothing special for a witbier, but it seems a bit stronger than normal wit.

THe spices and orange continue into the taste. There is also some wheat and yeast in the flavor. But this one is light, there is a small bit of aftertaste but this could be downed like water.

The mouthfeel is conducive to massive quaffing. It is light bodied, slightly bubbly and slightly watery.

This is more of a summertime beer, it is easily quaffable. Overall it isnt bad, it is more pedestrian than some of the Belgian Witbiers, more like Hoegaarden, not a bad thing if you want a lawnmower beer in humid weather but in the winter it is rather bland.

Ive stated that Wittekerke (though poorly thought of on this site) is my favorite witbier, although its status is definitely threatened by this beer.  This is extremely balanced for a witbier, and doesnt seem intended for the Blue Moon/Spotted Cow drinker who craves something extremly sweet.  I thought the flavor was very pleasant but not over-powering.

As stated in other reviews, the color is straw-yellow and cloudy, with a modicum of white head.  Aroma is yeasty, lightly citrus-sweet, with a not-obnoxious amount of cloviness.  Flavor is more of the same but with the addition of a nice maltiness that seems to create balance and doesnt seem at all out of place.  Mouthfeel is adequate.

RE-RATE 6/18/2011 Bottle from Central Market. 
This beer is bottle carbonated which means it was packaged with yeast, which still remain at the bottom. Often time I will pour out the yeast but the label on this beer gave strict instructions to include the yeast with the beer so in it went! This gave the beer a naturally cloudy appearance with a light golden color. There is a fair white head on it that lingers for just a bit before fading.

There is a mix of yeasty notes and spice on the nose. The yeast gives it a light bready feel that is paired well with sharp fruit and the spice is a clove-esque type smell.

The flavor is more spice and clove than sweet fruit and has a bitter finish that goes through to the end. If there was a bit more sweetness and fruit it would make this beer superb.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

4591,"2008-09-27",4.6,"Presentation: (Labeled Batch # 33.) It was poured from a brown, corked and caged 750ml bottle into a witbier tumbler. 

Appearance: Its color was light yellow with a hazy body that produced a light white colored head. The head had a soapy appearance with large and small bubbles that hang out for a long time and make nice spotty lace on the glass.

Smell: The aroma is full of wonderful malty wheat tones, yeast and spice.

Taste/Mouth feel: It has a bright vibrant flavor and smooth palate. It has a mostly sweet malt with some wheat tang and nice mild yeast flavor. Coriander and Curacao orange peel give it a good spicy and bitter/sweet citrus touch that works well with the very mild and slightly herbal hops. A smooth creamy texture, medium body and lively carbonation give it a very refreshing character.

4591,"2008-06-10",3.5,"Tap at Lenoras way in Brooklyn. So for my 100th rating, I was going to try something special, a bit out of the ordinary. I have a few special beers coming in and was going to wait for one of them to rate, but it didnt turn out as I planned.On this super hot day in NY I wandered in to this bar around noon, and found it empty.The owner let me in and said he wasnt fully open but feel free to sit down. A moment later, someone walks in and they start talking about an event, which I ask them about. At this point they both turn to me, and the owner introduces me to Rob of Allagash. I have  to say I was pretty thrilled to meet him.I had yet to order a beer, but at that point it only made sense to order an Allagash, and the white was available on tap so that made for an easy choice. Now wheat beer is really not my thing, but under the circumstances, and with the fact that Rob  immediately said to the owner, ""Ill buy that"" made the beer that much tastier.He was extremely nice, and I enjoyed the few minutes that I got to chat with him. So my 100th review didnt go as planned, but it couldnt have gotten much better. Oh yea, the white is pretty tasty, and refreshing on a hot day, even for the non wheat beer fan.","jericho, New York, USA","TeamTrappist"

4591,"2008-05-16",3.4,"12oz. bottle. Pours a light gold with a slight haze and highlights of yellow/straw. The head pours medium in thickness and white in color. The aroma is very strong with citrus peel and with the spicy/citrusy smell of coriander. Notes of wheat and a very subtle note of sweetness also show up in the aroma. The flavor starts crisp, light, and dry with spice, a very subtle sweet maltiness, and a good bit of unmalted grain. As the beer nears mid-palate, the spice and orange zest strengthen. There is a nice interplay of coriander, wheat, and hop bitterness at the apex, leading to a crisp, dry, spicy, lemon oil finish. The mouthfeel is full and creamy - considering how light the beers flavor, the body is quite nice (must be from the use of oats). Overall, a decent white beer, but the spice character is almost too prominent - more malted wheat character and more citrus would have been nice, too.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Pours a semi-clear golden pale brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind a fine film and white ring. Aroma of light multi-grain malt, some citrus zest, light herbal spice, and a touch of banana esters. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with a more wit flavor than its aroma. More banana, yeast and clove flavors come out in the taste. Finish is semi-sweet, a little watery with a dry banana and yeast aftertaste flavor.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

Well, taste brings in some nice sharpness from spices and a little more hop than the style should need. While Im not the biggest fan of wheat esters, I actually missed them from this beer. But... swirling the last bit in the bottle and pouring the yeast gave me a familiar cloudy body and a light custard head, however brief. More of the usual wit flavor was there. Yeah, thats it.

On the aftertaste theres just a hint of woodsy oak and a bit of dry sweetness. Smooth from start to finish. Wonderfully balanced and amazingly easy to drink. More please.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WankerWeasel"

4591,"2007-07-31",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2008 Been waiting to taste this high percentile witbier, this is one of my favorite styles. I love it when the label has the hypnotizing pour method and directions.  Great appearance in a big clear glass. A little more hay colored than many witbiers. Aroma is a little sour in this short stubby twist off bottle. Initially the smell is a little musty.but once poured  In the glass the aroma clears and is more volatile.  Good creamy  microbubble fizz. Flavor is thoroughly enjoyable. Very little if any bitterness in this brew.  As you drink a mild  impression marks its spot on the back of the throat that I hesitate to call bitter. Perhaps just a little malt bite, I dont know. Good flavor for a witbier above 5% hides the alky well.  Overall, just a plain good example of this enjoyable style, simply great. Certainly one of the better wheatbeers in my repertoire. Certainly as good as Pax and Ommegang. Not quite on par with East End wit and Hoegaarden. Better than sammy adams wit.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Smell is of lemon, clove, orange peel, pils malt, along with some malty sugar.
Taste is of the same aromas that make for a great American version of a witbier.

4591,"2006-08-01",4.0,"This beer gets high marks from me. And that is saying something coming from a guy who is not all that fond of many of the Witbiers hes had. This is definitely a great summer beer and celebration beer at the same time. This is the beer that you want for a gradation party when its 100 degrees out side by the pool, you know...

Appearance: Cloudy yellow color with a big head and lots of lacing.

Smell: Zesty spicy lemon 

Taste & Mouthfeel: The beer is very effervescent from the beginning that really add to the zippy character on the palate as you taste it. There is some depth to this Witbier. The taste of wheat and lemon with orange peel and coriander blend together then the wheat malts become a little more distinct as the lemon also separates as the bitter flavor. All the while spicy zippy and very refreshing.

Drinkability: This is a very drinkable refreshing beer good any time but recommended for when you need a quencher.

Hope this is helpful.

Aroma: Yeasty and wheaty odor wih a hint of citrus.  You definitely knew you were going to be drinking a White beer with this scent.
Appearance: Hazy straw orange in color.  Not as much sedimenation as I expected with the pouring instructions on the label but that was fine.  Head was frothy and rocky white bubbles with some lacing that sustained nicely.
Flavor: Yeasty and wheaty like the odor suggested with the orange peel coming through at the end.  The coriander was very subtly  noted which blended together gave it a bit of a bubble gum taste.

4591,"2006-05-30",3.4,"In my secretive quest to find a witbier that betters Hoegaarden, many have fallen at the knees of the juggernaut that it is. In theory it seems highly plausible as one might call witbiers, as a style, fairly mild and lucid. Yet the balance of these timid brews is the key that unlocks such delicate complexity. Allagashs White is yet another example of a wit that came close, but as Perrault reminds us in Cinderella, simply does not fit. In appearance it is as dainty and ethereal as any other of its genre, but shrouded in a veil that just transpares its unctuous golden mango body. Under the white crown an inconspicuous aroma of pineapple, pear and yeast is loosely laced together. The flavor simply reminds of mineral water touched with lemon and the whisper of fatigued cloves and coriander. Allagashs effort lacks just a soupçon of presence and character - so I ask, who will adorn the glass slipper?","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

4591,"2006-03-24",3.1,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2007 Ephemeral food, while adorable, is not what I prefer to eat.  Those pricey restaurants that flock to the commercial and tech business centers cook about $10 worth of food, make it pretty and charge twenty or thirty bucks, leaving the eater with an empty wallet and an even emptier stomach.  I dont care how lovingly garnished the olive appetizer is.  Its a single olive and there is no way its going to compensate for my caloric loss between lunch and dinner.  Fine cuts of steak should look like that came from a fully grown cow.  If I see a tiny sliver of beef that couldnt have come from anything larger than a ruminant fetus, Im going to have to take a quick trip to Chipotle and eat a full sized burrito just to end the night thinking I had a substantial meal.  Luxurious restaurants have their place, but for me that place is few and far between.  And like my food, I dont find satisfaction in lightweight or insubstantial beers.  Those like Allagash White, which I think does a great disservice to the style of Belgian Whites.  I know Belgian Whites can have enough substance to be a clear and present style in the beer world.  Hoegaarden was one of my first quality beers, and Ive loved it since.  But Allagash White is just a spectral version of a good Belgian White, on the verge of fading into obscurity, or as my palate calls it semi-transition into water.  By appearance the Allagash differs little from the standard Wit; the same semi-cloudy yellow body with the cumulous bleached white head, and the familiar smells of a lemon twist, with an added bonus of spices.  But the taste is weak, and the palate even weaker.  Maybe it is the palate I hate the most after all.  Its irritably thin, and feels like working with a delicate art piece.  Should drinking a beer feel like painting a Faberge egg?  Absolutely not!  Should opining over a sturdy and studious masculine beverage be like treading around precariously balanced ice sculptures?  Of course not!  So why drink the Allagash White?  There is a benefit somewhere in its excessively gentility, but what it is I cant find.  Maybe its apropos for the patient recovering from surgery.  A beer light enough to drip onto a 3rd degree burnt tongue, but with enough alcohol to pick the patient up from his drowsy, anaesthetized slumber.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Allagash White finishes with more citrus and tart wheat notes, then ends with a slight spicy note that lingers on the tongue. 

This is an excellent domestic example of a classic Belgian beer style, and the perfect beer to pair with a number of dishes.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

The head is beautiful, a creamy little cloud mountain.","Paleolithic, Pennsylvania, USA","xproudfoot"

Taste begins spicy and lemony, fades off into a very nice banana finish.  Very refreshing, although a bit out of place in cold weather.

The taste started with a great balance of orange/lemon notes. Coriander and white pepper notes join in the middle, along with some slightly tropical fruit, like banana, and then a little clove. The end brings a mild hop smack and fairly dry champagne like finish. The mouthfeel was medium. The balance was remarkably dead on.

A little acidic and spicy on the palate.  Smooth - kept seeming like it wanted to elevate its flavor elements but itd plateau too early.

The second time, I suggested it to friend who's a big fan of wits and was almost embarrassed by my selection.

Anyways in the tradition of its style this is a fruity sweet beer with lots of complex flavor. I wish I had it with an orange or lemon as that is how I usally drink this style. The only thing I can thing of negitive is that it is slightly more sour( the bad batch very sour) than Blue Moon or Hoegarrden which to me is not a good thing.

Small head.
Begins understated and light, but body comes out somewhat and there is a very delicate coriander and lemon flavor.  Yeast flavor comes out as it warms and is very light though distinct.  A nutty undertone emerges as well.  Very little alcohol taste throughout.  Medium body and leaves a fresh lemony flavor on the palate.  This was a nice change from the almost cloying Hoegarden, but perhaps takes too much out of the beer and leaves it a little bit light/watery.
2004 bottle.  The description from above is surprisingly spot on for the bottle.  Maybe a bit less wateriness, as expected.  I'm upping the color a point as it is light and very pale, but still bottle conditioned and shimmering.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Original rating of:
3-4-5-3-10

Re-Rate:
The first sample came from the Dayton Ale fest.  Later when we came home, we found a bottle of this in the beer stash.  Hence the re-rate.  From the bottle, the aroma was more discernable as a mild floral malty one.  The head was much larger and the body was much more hazy due to the yeast in the bottle we poured.  The mouthfeel was more bubbly and finished more smoothly.  Thflavor was also more noticeable with elements of malt and coriander appearing.  All-in-all, I gave it a 5-3-6-4-13 at home.  Combining this rating with the other I bumped up the aroma from3 to 4, flavor from 5 to 6 and overall fom 10 to 12.  Thus proving what we already know to be true that a bottle is better than a sample!","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

Taste is good, could have a little more body though, but its a good wheat style belgian, lightly lemony, a bit of spice and a very clean wheat backing. Pretty darn good. Its a bit empty on the feel, goes right into the lemony spice and just ends, no real finishing qualities.

Very ""wet"" palate, with a smoothly effervescent mouthfeel.  Medium-full bodied, unusual for this style.

Light pinyness in the aroma with stank beer notes intermingled to give a rather refreshing aroma esp. suited for summer. White cheese notes and coriander with an oily pininess that could be come rather sickening to the stomach after a couple.

(I enjoyed an octoberfest we had more)  The beer is a pale cloudy gold, with a somewhat disappointing thin head.  The beer itself is light to medium bodied, with an interesting spiced flavor Im not too familiar with.  It tastes a bit like orange, but a little tangier and sharper.  Altogether, I found it to be enjoyable and a fun drink.  Theres a distinct yeasty flavor in the finish, which is actually really nice.  Hops are pretty much non-existent.
