Sweetish-malty, moderately roasty and slightly resiny aroma of dark chocolate, coffee and some pine. Slightly sweetish, malty, rather roasty and slightly resiny taste of dark chocolate, lots of coffee, some licorice and hints of pine, followed by a medium long, rather dry-bitter and slightly resiny finish. Medium to full body, creamy mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Very nice, although less hoppy than the name suggests.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"

186,"2017-06-10",3.4,"Pours dark brown from the bottle and leaves a brown, frothy head. Aroma goes at first into chocolate, then the hops come through and remind very much of an IPA  pine and grapefruit being evident. Taste is bittersweet but with the bitter component gaining the upper hand. Medium bodied, very dry, with a feel in the mouth of wet cotton. Makes you thirsty. Overall though, not bad. Certainly not a traditional porter, and feels throughout much more like a black IPA.","Butzbach, Hesse, GERMANY","hauxe"

186,"2016-06-30",4.2,"37-my Porter na świecie. 
 Chmiele:  Chinook, Columbus 
 Data butelkowania:  24.02.2016 
 Data ważności:  24.02.2017 
 Kolor:  Na pierwszy rzut oka wydaję się czarny. Patrząc jednak pod światło widać, że w rzeczywistości jest to ciemny brąz. 
 Piana:  Betonowa wręcz, bujna kremowo-beżowa góra!
Piana jest hiper-drobna, jak na azocie.
Tworzy ona jedną zbitą warstwę.
Lacing jest wręcz niebywały. Fale Dunaju, a raczej Tamizy w pełnej okazałości.
Doskonała, wysoka obrączka na górze piwa, niczym pianka na Cappuccino. 
 Zapach:  Klasyka gatunku. Intensywna czekoladowa słodycz, wzbogacona o melasę i odrobinę słodowej, chlebowej bazy.
Na zapleczu kawa z mlekiem. 
W oddali lekka paloność.
Mam wrażenie, że co jakiś czas przewija się nutka żywicy - to prawdopodobnie sprawka Chinooka. 
Jest także delikatna ziołowa woń. 
 Smak:  W smaku nie jest już tak klasycznie jak na Portera przystało, ale to nawet lepiej. Jest oryginalnie.
Na pierwszy plan wysuwa się tutaj nuta lasu iglastego. Sosnowe, żywiczne nuty przyjemnie wibrują na języku.
Dopiero po chwili do głosu dochodzi stylowa czekoladowość, która zdecydowanie oscyluje w kręgach gorzkiej czekolady. Kawowa wytrawność objawia się na ostatniej prostej.
Jest także silna nuta włoskich orzechów z charakterystycznym cierpkim posmakiem w ustach.
Goryczka średnio intensywna. Posmak kawy z odrobiną gorzkiej czekolady długo utrzymuje się w ustach. Finał jest długi, kremowy. Słodycz pięknie równoważy się z wytrawną kawą i orzechami.
Wysoka pijalność i aksamitność na języku - to najważniejsze cechy Porteru. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie.
 Podsumowanie:  

Klasyk, czy nie klasyk? Oto jest pytanie?
Otóż nie klasyk, ale za to wybitnie dobry Porter. Nie klasyk z pewnością przez silne żywiczne, leśne i iglaste akcenty, nieczęsto przecież spotykane w Porterach. Zarówno Chinook, jak i Columbus wnoszą takie cechy do piwa. 

Jest to zdecydowanie American Porter z mocniejszym alkoholen niż w wersjach z Wysp Brytyjskich. Bardziej nachmielonym z akcentami kawy, czekolady, orzechów i lekką palonością.

Kremowa, wspaniała aksamitna tekstura. Wysoka pijalność i gładkość odbioru.

Pours a black color, with a medium, brown head.

Smells unusual hoppy for this style of beer, with grassy oranges among, roasted, smoky, salt topped dark malts. Results into a beautiful nose featuring soft bakers chocolate, infused with orange- and lemon peel. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth with a lower carbonation, featuring a dough creaminess.

Tastes of toasty, earthen malts, which got a subtle toffee sweetness to them, as well as a salty minerality. On top of that settles a whiff of earthy coffee and a fruity, orange defined hoppiness. The hops turn a tad grassier during the beers finish, while they blend very well into a pleasant, slightly dry coffee bitterness, without getting less creamy.

What a lovely hop, coffee and roasty malt flavour, the clean fresh hoppiness is reeled in by the coffee and malts. Soft mouthfeel in fact the carbonation is wonderful. Lovely beer.

A very dark brown colour, it has a 1 finger of tannish foam and does great with the lacing.

The smell is surprisingly light but what I get is mostly a soft roasted malt aroma with some chocolate. Okay, I pulled it from the fridge so Ill let it warm up some to see or smell what happens.

Its been a half hour now and theres now a nice bit of hop bitterness beginning to show itself. 

The hop bitterness is definitely there in the taste. It kind of pushes the roasted malt and chocolate aside but not totally and Im liking the flavour mix. This particular bottled conditioned bottle says its 6.0% abv but Im not going to submit a change as it seems the abvs for their brews are not written in stone.

Bit of choc sponge cake on the finish.  I do like the Kernel beers.  Always interesting.  Real fresh hops on the aroma, with some choc sponge.  Funny, Ive had 2 beers that taste of choc sponge in 5 days along with the De Molen Murder and Doodslag thing from ACBF.  Tasty beer.  But I cant tell whether I like it or not (actually I do like it).  Definite coffee on the finish.  In fact the finish which I can still taste 5 mins on, is coffee.  Maybe just a touch too hoppy?

The nuttiness particularly seems to bridge the gap between the roast/coal and the pine. Medium body and again - stunningly deep flavour. The malt is the main actor here, with coffee upfront, backed by the roast. On the supporting role we have a neat piney and resiny hoppiness, accurately dosed.

Taste is less complex but still  very good with roasted malt, caramel, coffee and vanilla. Theres also a slight acidic/citrus presence and a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel is kind of creamy. Body is thin to medium. No alcohol presence. Not too much sweetness. Extreme drinkability. Top notch Porter!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Aroma - pineapples, a bit citrusy, fresh grass.
Taste - quite complex, usual ipa tones, then switching to light porter tones - great!

186,"2012-06-13",4.1,"Pours black with a lovely tan head that stays a while.
Nice and smooth, has a bitterness to it that youd normally associate with a stout I think. Liquorice, bitter dark chocolate, fairly dry with a fair amount of hops on the finish.
Had this on draught and Im fairly certain the ABV was 6% - or at least it was marked up on the display as 6%.
Very good, not what I was expecting.","","CHW"
186,"2012-06-08",3.7,"My Bottom Line :  
Dark chocolate and toasted bread converge on this Porters cherry-like hints before green hop bitterness and molasses undertones complete a compelling picture. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam tops the blackness with dark brown edges.
-Carbonation is quite fluffy, building a pillowy mouthfeel.
-Roastiness hits you at first, but the malts complexity is slowly, but surely, unveiled.
-That is one attractive nose.

186,"2012-06-08",3.6,"(Bottle, 5.8%). Pours decent brown head, persisting well. Opaque, dark, muddy brown. Mid carb. Musky, spicy hop aroma; a bit cannabis-like and some sharp pine, some tropical fruit, and lots of dark, roasted malt aroma, with a bit of coffee. Nice, but the muskiness is a bit off-putting. Taste - Quite bitter, with dry, strongly roasty malts (ashy espresso), followed by quite a lot of spicy and fruity hop flavours and pine, which clear the palate to an extent. Theres a lingering bitter, ashy aftertaste, which is a bit unpleasant; not enough sweeter malt lingering to balance it out. Some nice resiny hop tastes when you burp though :P 
Medium body, slightly oily and astringent finish.
Overall, nice, with some pleasant and slightly unusual flavours and packing a big taste punch for 5.8%, but its a bit too dry and bitter for me, which means that i had to drop the taste and overall scores a bit.","Essex, ENGLAND","essexcalf"

186,"2011-07-11",2.8,"Bottle Cloudy brown with a small, creamy, off-white head. Aromatically, all Im really picking up here is fudge. Nice, but far too subtle. Medium-bodied with nearly expired carbonation. The flavor is just bland  lightly tangy with a mild cocoa powder component. Finishes lightly tangy and watery. I was told this was The Kernels take on New Glarus Unplugged Old English Porter. Ummm nope! Not my thing, but I appreciate the opportunity to try it.

Strong resiny wooden lacquer aroma with spicy orange notes, as well as some earth. Dry-sweet roasty oranges and earth taste. Mid-bodied. Flat, dull mouthfeel, unsurprisingly.

186,"2011-05-09",3.4,"[330ml bottle, The Bottle Shop, Canterbury] Black pour as one would expect, fluffy white head. Hops on the aroma, plus bitter roasted malt. Porter flavours are the ones that predominate  there are hops going on, but mostly dark malt flavours. Chocolate rather than coffee  surprisingly not much alcohol on the palate.

186,"2011-04-01",4.0,"Bottle; bought @ brewery consumed at home.


Had to have an aggresisive pour with this one as the content exploded a little out of the glass. No big gusher but the first time Ive had a Kernel beer gush a little. Poured into La Choffe glass. Good mocha lacing, really nice opaque black appearance. 

Aroma is full on roasted malts, coffee; spices, typiical high present hop-aroma from Evin, chocolate, liquorish, leather and smoke.

Taste is silky velvet; leather, berries, roasted malt, liqourish, burnt toast, ask, tobacco, a hidden citirc hop bite, orange peel, hazelnuts and those big nuts you get for Christmas whcih I cant reemmber!

Fantastic stuff and something which could be laid down for some time.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"

186,"2011-03-12",4.1,"A Mes rate. Bottle at The Kernel.Thanks have to go out to Evin for making sure I tried this. My god its good. The aroma is a barrage of chocolate and grassy hops. It shouldnt work but by jingo old chap, I think its a beauty. Phenominally good in fact. There is a glorious herbal note that just sits so well. Almost fennel, almost rosemary, so noseable. Not quite so good in the mouth but its still very tasty. Slight hop resin, really good roast coffee notes. Lengthy fresh malt and chocolate finish. Just bloody excellent all round.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
