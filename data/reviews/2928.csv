2928,"2016-02-29",3.5,"Visual: (old labeling prior to 2015, cellared for 4 years). Pours clear orange amber with no head, lots of slow and steady micro streams.

Nose: big clove aroma with cinnamon and orange peel. (lvl-9)-pungency

Attack: crisp, thicker mouthfeel

Mid-palate: light fizzy, star anise, alcohol zing and mild heat, fruity (lvl-7-sweetness), apple juice backbone, cinnamon, tangy sour candied orange

Finish: residual sticky sugars, apple juice & star anise exhale.

Summary: Lots of spices augment the clean apple backbone in this one, making it quite an interesting cider. It drinks something like a mead but lighter 0n the palate, especially at the finish. Beautiful aroma.","","sulawang"
2928,"2015-10-10",3.6,"Pours peachy pink. Nose of sweet Apple, rubbing alcohol and spice. Somewhat mead flavour - honey, clove and apple pulp. Very interesting and sippable. Purchased in Parksville, BC, for $16.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
2928,"2015-10-01",5.0,"Oh. My. Word. I saved a bottle of this from last year and its still so amazing. Orange peel, coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg. So many glorious spices in my nose and mouth. This is my favorite seasonal cider of all time. The 14% ABV isnt a terrible thing either, perfect for cold days. Looking forward to the next release!","","Craftbrewhaha"
2928,"2015-03-29",3.9,"750ml bottle. Variety of apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, orange peel, brown sugar. Has some real complexity to it. Dry finish with a sow alcohol warmth. Beautiful.","","LarryBeast"
2928,"2015-03-20",3.7,"Tasting at MattsNice amber color. Its a moderately sweet cider, with warm alcohol feeling, warm spices (cinnamon, cloves) and light orangey touch; the final is lightly hot, peppery; and it has some trace of mature apples. I know that this is basically not a true cider, but its a pleasant drink.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2928,"2015-01-21",3.8,"750mL bottle, pours a clear golden bronze with basically no head. Nose brings out light spices, medium sweet apples, liqueur, and a thorough dryness to this despite the high ABV, which is fairly well-hidden. Flavour is heavily spiced, with notes of cinnamon and clove upfront, followed by light orange peel, sweet apples, and alcohol. I know this isnt authentic, but this sure is well-balanced and multi-dimensional. ABV is scarily well-hidden, with not much of a burn, though there is a nice warming effect. Excellent non-traditional ""cider"".","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2928,"2015-01-11",4.1,"750 mL bottle pour split. Pours a shiny pure gold color. Aroma of honey, spices, and warm apples. Cinnamon, apples, and brown sugar powered flavor, and very nicely done. Cant believe this is so high in abv. Drinks easy. Wow. Awesome stuff.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2928,"2015-01-11",4.4,"Excellent cider, tastes slightly like cinnamon. You get the awesome flavors of brown sugar and star anise with the sweetness of it being a hard apple cider.","Washington, USA","brian43281"
2928,"2015-01-09",3.6,"Bottle - Warm dark sugars and spices. Clear gold. Spices, cinnamon, clove and some nutmeg along with apples. Like an apple turnover. Although heavy on spice a surprisingly light finish with only the hint of spices lingering.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2928,"2013-07-28",4.3,"Beautiful clear dark golden/amber pour. Nose of anise and citrus, background aromas of burnt sugar and clove. Sweet burn coupled with a chewy body makes this a real sipper. Sweet but sharp in the finish to provide balance. The crown jewel of Sea Ciders lineup. Would love to see a lower abv version with the same spices and flavors.","Portland, Oregon, USA","goodbyeohio"
2928,"2013-06-02",3.7,"750, swingtop, capped. Pours a crystal clear medium copper with no head or lace. Bright winter spice nose, very Christmassy, showing cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Creamy medium body with soft carb. Caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and plenty of tart apples on the mid palate. Long spicy finish with apple tart acidity and a bit of brown sugar. Quite nice.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
