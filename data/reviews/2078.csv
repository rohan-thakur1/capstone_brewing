Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.

Ambrée et limpide, une énorme mousse persistante tient mordicus à être là, alors quelle dessine une dentelle écumeuse.

Par moment, des effluves sucrées et fruitées, par le raisins vert ou encore la prune jaune, viennent me contredire. Plutôt coriace en bouche, un goût caractérisé par le caramel et les épices.

Overall an interesting brew.  I find Saint-Sylvestre to be the only French brewer of interest I know.  But still, the ""biere de garde"" style is not one of my favorites.

The beer is transparent and yellow hued, with 1/2"" or so of white head and some decent lacing. The aroma brings grain, wet cardboard, apples, alcohol. In general, it just seems a bit off. The taste brings some odd funk, apples soaked in booze, and grain. Mouthfeel is decent, assuming you can get past the odd flavors and imbalanced nature of this unusual beer. Overall, not a repeat for me.

The taste is dominated by a spicy hop character, and erthy, yeast notes, against a firm malt backbone. The alcohol burns through a tad too strongly, but I also think this is coherent with the style.. Also notes of funk, straw, citrus peel, wax, apples.
Long, warming, dry finish. A very rustique ale, true to style, very drinkable. (2011-06-01)","SWEDEN","TheJestersBeer"

Pours a bright, clear, beautiful golden-orange color; significant, off-white, fine-bubbled head with solid retention and lacing; nice-looking pour on this. From the first sniff, this has all the markings of an authentic farmhouse ale: a modestly funky, cobwebby yeast character, suggesting brett amidst a wide-reaching cocktail of yeast strains; a bright citrus note at the forefront, some overripe fruits (but not overly so), hints of a caramel note; very engaging nose; reasonably well-attenuated. Medium-full body; lively carbonation; no alcohol showing with any roughness (slightly warming as it warms in the glass), and reasonably smooth; nice presentation in the mouth; lots of doughy and toasty maltiness, some honeyed malts and mild citrus, plus that nicely funky / rustic yeast character: white pepper, citrus, and a slightly tart component; nicely crisp at the core of things, and just a very authentic-seeming, mildly funky, pleasantly done Biere de Garde; one of the best Ive ever sampled; seriously, huge amounts of pepperiness that builds.

3 Monts Grande Reserve pours a surprisingly clear deep golden with stream after stream of moderate sized carbonation bubble rising to the surface. A standard pour brought about a hefty, three fingers worth of microbubbled bright white head. The head eventually settled at a finger and left incredible puffy drink lines on its way down the glass. This beer looks appetizing to say the least.

Although the aroma is light it has an incredible depth. A hint of freshly husked grains is the first thing to greet my nose, this combines with a pale malty sweetness thats very candy like. The yeast brings about an incredible complexity laden with peaches, green apple, chardonnay and a slight earthy mustiness. The aroma of this beer just draws me right in, making me want a drink immediately. 

The flavor follows the aroma closely. Very vinous with the mustiness coming through faintly throughout the entire drink. Mild fresh graininess mixes it up with the sweet pale maltiness. The grape character leads the way in the fruit department but the green apple and peach make solid appearances. This is a very well put together beer with a great depth of flavor. 

The mouthfeel on this beer is excellent! The carbonation makes the body light and airy all the while being refreshing. Theres a nice crispness and slight drying on the finish. 

The light, airy body makes this beer incredibly easy to put away. I could see myself drinking this until the alcohol caught up with me. An incredible drinkability when the abv is taken into consideration.

I loved 3 Monts when I had it and couldnt find 3 Monts Grande Reserve for a long time now. Luckily I came across a few bottles and its just as good as the original which is really saying something. The two beers Ive had from this brewery leave me wanting more.

2078,"2008-10-10",3.2,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2010 2007 version.  Had a small helping of this during an informal beer tasting.  Pours a blonde color with an abnormally large cream head.  Aroma is faint of soap, unscented flowers, and other rather indescript scents.  Flavor was also subdued, featuring unripe fruit, biscuit, and some sour/bitterness.  Finish dominated by alcohol and metal.  I dont understand this beer, and it probably didnt help that I am not familiar with Biere de Gardes. 2.8.
update: ""3 Monts Grande Reserve"" sampled 7/10/10: bottle. Looks like my palate has changed slightly since last rating, though I still dont think this is an easy beer to understand nor appreciate.  Subtle notes of peat, white pepper, and dried peach are perceived, though not immediately apparent.  I got a rather creamy note of coconut in the finish.  As always, flavors are musty and all seemingly veiled by a layer of age. 3.2.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

The aroma opened with sour lighter fruits and vinegar, opening into a corn and bready core.. light, dusty spice accents.. warmth brought out a little lemon and dry floral notes that grew on me.  The flavor had rather strong corn and pale malts at the core, giving faint whispers of malt likka.. tangy on the edges with lemon zest and dusty funk.. finished dry and a little sharp with light fruits and aged toffee.

Great fluffy white lacing is left behind.  Aroma is a little musty, some cork and a bit of hay.  Light to medium bodied, well carbonated.

Perhaps its Verkade Mariakaakjes that Im smelling... (And yes, I took that from anothers rating.  I thought it was great that bierkoning could get so specific!)  Has a bitter, tart malty flavor as well with an almost face-puckering sour finish.  I find this biere de garde to be more interesting than enjoyable.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"

2078,"2004-11-30",3.5,"Pours a hazed, copper-amber color, that sits beneath a  frothy light tan head that creates a wispy Belgian Lace as it subsides.  The aroma is spicy, fruity and malty with notes of apples, ginger, pear, caramel, vanilla, and toasted malt.  This has quite the classic Bier De Garde nose, predominantly malty with nice complimentary notes of fruit and spice.  This beer is well carbonated, it foams effervescently as it hits my tongue for the first time.  The taste is sweet up front with nice fruity notes of apples, but then moves to a sharp prickly mix of carbonation, ginger and alcohol.  This beer is quite good, though because of its strength, it does have tell tale notes of alcohol in the finish, which detracts a little bit.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2078,"2004-11-02",3.7,"Minty, almost candy-like yet herbal aroma. Dark orange and hazy body is topped by a small off-white head that recedes to ring with some patchy lacing.

Very fresh, wonderfully vegetal/herbal nose:  mint, freshly cut grass and a touch of caramel.  Heavy carbonation (perhaps a touch too much), fairly strong herbal qualities at the front, little sweetness.  A rather rough and agressive BDG; though I liked it a lot, it doesnt quite fit what I want most of the time.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2078,"2004-10-31",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2004 Deep orange, darker than expected, murky. Light white head. Big off-dry aroma comes out musty. Its fruitier than most bière de garde with this dried mango, orange and peach flavour profile. Yet its just as rustic with this old cellar counterpart, lots of fluffy mustiness in there, notes of ashes, cask wood, uncleaned fireplace, hay Nice range. Dry dusty palate, never very sweet, yet fruity. Spicy, feeling green (chive). It has a slight lactic bite to it mysteriously. Notes of bubblegum, smoke, cement. I guess what I like the most is how the yeast planes over the rest of the flavours. Big carbonation, medium body. Good, but no cigar.. and I expected one. Cheers TAR!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2078,"2004-10-23",3.5,"Orange.  Moderately aromatic, with scents of coriander, orange, toasted malt, flowers, grass and caramel.  Tastes very much like a Biere De Garde with a little bit of a tripel aspect as well.  An elaborate fruitiness is present providing notes of orange and pear along with a light hoppiness and notes of toasted malt and caramel.  The yeast reminds of Dupont.  Tasty.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
2078,"2004-10-12",4.2,"Bottled as Grande Reserve.  Slightly cloudy orange color with a beautiful large white head.  Aroma is sweet malt, yeast, hops and spice.  Very soft body.  Flavor is much the same as the aroma, however the hop/spice finish is more pronounced.  A complex beer but exceedingly drinkable. Tres bien!","Oswego, Illinois, USA","TerryR"

Good lacing too.  Sour lemon aroma mixed with some cheese, cobweb, and alcohol. Interesting for sure.  Dry alcohol, sourness, spicey, musty tatste.  But all very subtle.  Rather tasty and interesting.","Rowlett, Texas, USA","flemdawg"
2078,"2004-08-29",4.7,"The first thing you know about this ale, once freeing the cork and letting the beer flow free, is the enormous, volcanic, titanic, utterly brobdignagian head of foam that gushes forth and overwhelms the glass, spills unto the floor, and before you know it, youre licking the linoleum!
Aroma: Sweetness supreme! Im sorry, if youre not an angel in human form, you probably have no right to know this sublimity...oh, wait, its YOU! Okay, go ahead...sparkly, yeasty, fruity, heady, ..oooh, Im on cloud 10! Its one more, you understand...
Appearance: a murky, cloudy, amber hue, closer to a pale orange, actually...
Taste: lightness, sweetness, fruit, divinity, transendence, uplifting goodness, unparalleled happiness resulting from, goodness, this is that rare kind of beer that makes me swoon, do you hear, swooon!
Each further sip cause me to reel back again, and further settle into this luscious enveloping of beauty...yes, every once in a while, you find beauty in a beer, and this is then...oh, Lordy..
Body, if we MUST get technical, is rather light, but dont tell that to FLAVOR, oh, no, for the finish dont know the meaning of that word, brother! Rings and chimes in the caverns of the senses for what seems like forever! And long may it, indeed! I can see no further pleasure to be found of a beer of this caliber, if there is any other...Im going to have a fine time emptying this bottle, oh, yes, sir!

2078,"2004-05-29",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2004 A delicious biere de garde; slightly more hefty than the ""regular"" 3 monts; definitely breadier, biscuity - but has a really strong iron type slightly bittersweet steissspalt (sp?) presence. Delicious. Beautiful coppery color with a meringuey head. This is what Southampton was attempting to duplicate with great success (and also two brothers, close to this bar).

Aroma of alcohol with a mix of spice. Carbonation is perfect with lots of bubbles coming back on top of my glass. Taste is a mix between a strong Belgian ale with a mix of a good well aged port. The alcohol is mostly sensible in the aroma but undetectable form the taste. Overall, this is a beer that aged well and is true to the name bière de garde.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Pours a lovely light orange-amber/yellow, lightly hazy, bottle conditioned with a big slightly creamy wheat colored head.  Aroma is big and fruity, golden delicious apples, lightly spicy hops, raw barley, dusty cobwebs, and grassy herbs.  Flavor is equally impressive; vanilla liqueur, spicy yeast, yellow candied fruits, touch of sweet caramel and maybe some orange blossoms.

2078,"2003-12-05",2.9,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2014 Well this has certainly fallen off!  Rampant DMS and other flaws like flabby, husky malt and zero character renders this one unenjoyable for me.  Used to love it, but then again that was almost eight years ago.  Unfiltered ambered peach. Huge fluffy, sticky white foam. Fresh peppery nose crammed with grassy hops and straw. Buttery pale malts, coconut oil, phenols, and white grape undertones. Somewhat tangy and woody. Fluffy, expansive on the tongue. Starts rather tangy trailed by candied pale malts and light pepper. Subtle dried apricot twang is held up by long doughy, powdery malts and a delicate spicy hop kiss. Very grainily malty throughout. Finishes with a table grape tingle amid a honeyed pale malt and spicy hop composition. Lingering honey and earth notes. Wine geeks would be flabbergasted by this earthy, musty, vinous, malty farmhouse ale. (previous score in 2003: 8, 5, 9, 4, 17 = 4.3)","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (husks, toasted grain), lightly hoppy (herbs, flowers), lightly to moderately yeasty (basement/cement), with a note of DMS. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, husky. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Yeah, you know, Im just not that fond of this one anymore.  The reality is that its very husky in the malt department, and the wet cement and DMS notes are unattractive.  Total honesty?  Its not too dissimilar to a ho-hum Euro strong lager. Meh.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Refreshingly clean and crisp with grass, cider, a touch of alcohol, and sour grapes.
