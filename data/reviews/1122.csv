1122,"2017-06-04",4.3,"Taste sample from a 75cl bottle at Arrogant Sour Fest 2017. It pours a bright golden color with a small white head. Aroma is zesty and fruity with loads of funk, white wine, raisins, tangerine, light pineapple like sweetness. Taste holds more white wine and fruity sweetness around the edgy lemon juice notes, barnyard funk, raisins, hay, apricots. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, lambic and oxidised wine blend is unique and really works well","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"
1122,"2017-05-08",3.7,"Bottle - Light bright citrus and curry notes. Touch neutral. Clear gold with a decent white head. Bright citrus acidity and a light sweetness. Again quite neutral compared to other lambic, that earthy light woody cooking spice and not much else.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"

Pours orange colour with minimal head. Aroma is superb: citrus peel, earthy, some herbs, light sweetness. Flavors have typical Cantillon funk, white wine tones, more citrus, nutty (walnuts). Very complex yet balanced beer. Great!","BELGIUM","koen_belgium"

Clear golden with a clear frothy white head. Aroma is spicy, fruity and funky with 
turmeric, ground cumin, white grape skins, apple skins, lemon, some nutty notes, oak, barnyard, hay.
Taste is sour, fruity with a very light sweetness, spicy and funky.
Light to medium bodied, average carbonation. Dry and sour finish, almost too sour with a slight gastric note, lactic and citric acidity as well, light smooth grape sweetness and some nuttiness, lingering dry earthy spices.

Clear orange beer, no head. Aroma: grains, very rural, fruity touch, pears, herbal, spicy. MF: soft carbon, medium body. Taste: very very oxidized, this one. Spicy, dry and dusty, little fruity, lot of wood, soft acidity, bit lemony. Aftertaste: more oxidation, wood notes are clearly present.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
1122,"2016-12-29",4.6,"From notes. Enjoyed at Cantillon on November 12 during the brew day. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a lazy golden yellow color with a larger white head that falls down pretty quickly, leaving a nice lace in its wake. The aroma is full of citrus zest and Cantillon classic funk. I love the depth of citrus and the light tropical fruits that poke through. There is a hint of pepper and a nice funky barnyard on this as well. Damn, this is an excellent beer. The flavor is even better! The fruitiness, the funk, the hint of pepper that balances out perfectly. I love the oakiness and the light barnyard. This is just complex, clean, crisp, and fantastic. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly tart and sour finish. The fruits are the lingering bit. Hot damn. Im glad I got to get a bottle of this one!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1122,"2016-10-20",5.0,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2017 2016 bottle drunk 10/8/16.Rusty golden with a good clarity and large, off-white head showing good retention for the style.Oh wow. Ive had a lot of grape lambics and nothing even remotely like this. Obviously the grapes having been transformed in to a marvelous wine has a lot to do with that but wow, this is really something else. Just the most buoyant nose of kumquat, passion fruit and gooseberry mixing with wet hay-like funk and light black pepper. The oxidation from the wine is even here, creating further complexity with the light madeirasation. None of this masks the lambic, however, which is funky, bright and full of farmy goodness; light sulfur, hay and such. No alcohol or flaw. Completely wraps itself about the nose and I suspect this is one of those bottles which will sit empty for a year and still smell good.Gooseberry again, is prominent in the flavor, with light tannin from the oak and typical malt/wheat softness combining with the ultra-fine carbonation to provide a very soft texture. The fruity wine character persists and is joined by a spicy, sandalwood-like note and also more light sherry/madeira suggestions that add a completely different element. Youve got the fruitiness from the wine providing light sweetness, tartness and all sorts of interesting gooseberry/kumquat/passion fruit notes, yet also adding the oxidative element that surprisingly works so well in lambics (just look at the numbers on Zenne y Frontera). Then of course you have the lambic which is nicely sour, adding plentiful lactic and brett acids, light cheese/citrus rind and lingering mouth-puckering acidity. Really, really awesome beer and I cant wait to both try it again (hopefully) and even more importantly, try some of Mr. Tissots wines.Was on the fence between 4.8, 4.9 and 5.0, and it doesnt really matter, but Fu*k it, Im just giving it a 5.0.  Cantillon needs more hype anyways.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1122,"2016-05-23",4.4,"Sampled at quintessence, quite apt to have this at the last station (saving the best, and all..). This was yet another delicious foray into the Vin Jaune experimentation line using Stephane Tissots grape must, and its a nearly flawless execution. Heavy complexity from the fruit, strong flavors that have a bit of yeastiness & booziness, combined with a moderate tannin presence. A real think-piece, and an absolute pleasure.","Massachusetts, USA","gn0sis"
1122,"2016-05-23",4.2,"Shared by Jean. Alot of spices and cummin in the nose and flavour also tastes alot of raisins. You can really see the wine in it very cool beer.","SWEDEN","fredrik_"

1122,"2016-05-19",4.4,"Poured from a bottle at Cantillon. 
Aroma is similar to a finely aged Sauternes. Some honey notes with a medium light white grape note. Medium light oak notes. Light barnyard and herbal notes. Hints of red apple. Some almond and vanilla character from the barrel. Some light caramel and butterscotch as well. 
Poured from a bottle at Cantillon. Pours a slightly hazy, gold color with a thin, white head that lingers for a bit. 
Flavor is interesting with a light bitterness. Medium oak notes. Medium light honey notes. Medium, soft acidity. Some moderate white wine character. Light barnyard finish with a bit of hay. A bit less barrel character in the aroma. A touch of spiced apple cider. Light caramel as well. 
Mouthfeel is medium.bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, another great lambic from Cantillon. The aroma is simply amazing and reminds me so much of a really nice dessert wine but with a touch of that classic lambic character. The flavor has a bit less of the dessert wine character and a bit more lambic notes. Great, balanced, soft acidity. Nice grape notes and balanced barnyard character.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

1122,"2016-05-10",4.3,"Pours a very saturated yellow-golden color, with almost no head to speak of, as it disappears within the first few seconds after pouring, leaving the spotlight completely on delicious looking liquid.

Almost honey sweet on the nose, a floral grape fruitiness is cutting through, defining the aromas essentially. Produces a decadent sweetness of fermented, old but ripe grapes, heading into a mead direction together with dust and old wood.

Soft on the tongue, with a well fitting, lively carbonation, while producing a nice dryness during the finish, complimenting the otherwise sweet grape and producing a heavier bodied Lambic.

Exhibits a dry tartness from the beginning, together with sun ripened, bright and juicy grapes, coming along with a potent, dry punch. Finishes surprisingly sweet, with honey and a luscious ripe acidic quality among its dry, sour counterpart.

Very unusual to find such a well developed sweetness in a sour beer, which still manages to blend tart and sweet together, creating a very intriguing, intense Lambic, which leaves the palate with a pungent dryness forgetting about its honey beginning.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1122,"2016-05-06",5.0,"#7000. 750 ml. bottle sampled @ Quintessence 2016. I believe that there have been versions of Vin Jaune  the predecessor of this beer, one with wine must & one on barrels but I am not sure. This one is everything that Vin Jaune was (I think I tried a version with must) but explored to absolute perfection. Golden, wine-like, little white head. Nose is intense massive walnut even more so than Vin Jaune was with apple & some white grape, this akin to walnut wine, spectacular. Taste is massive walnut, low sweet white wine, grape, apple, desert wine, hazelnut, almond, raisin. Massively juicy, hard to describe even. Mind-blowing, easily one of the greatest beers I have ever had, mind-blowing brew. Hope I get to try it again.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

1122,"2016-05-05",4.6,"Bottle sample @ Quintessence 2016.
Couleur paille-orangée, col fin blanc mais restant minime.
Arôme au nez envoutant, fruité fermenté mais avec une certaine longueur de noisette et amande couplé de barrique. Petite touche de muscade qui offre une longueur aromatique extrêmement raffinée et complexe. On en oublie quais le bouquet du lambic qui reste plus en retrait mais procure cette signature Cantillon juste en rétro-nasal.
Palais nous propulse en plein Jura. Un fruité plaisant mais surtout un effet barrique superbement bien restitué et un vin jaune délicat qui offre une dimension superbe de noix. Je note une touche dananas-fruité frais qui tranche avec le lambic. Petite note balsamique et un léger côté amer-funk.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

re-rate after a kindly shared bottle, by Jean. No real difference on the tasting notes, but as this beer managed to blow my mind a second time, I can only give this a higher rating. 4.9 for now, as its the ultimate perfection. only thing keeping it from a straight 5/5 is that it isnt really commercially available, and thus not obtainable enough to sample it as good as Id like. if I drink it a third time, it will probably go up to a perfect 5.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
