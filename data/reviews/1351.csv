1351,"2016-05-19",3.5,"5/18/2016: Wow, this beer presents nicely with its deep copper-red color and lathery off-white head. Its malty, but not overly sweet, candy-like or plain sugary and thats a good thing. ""Cookie dough"" is actually and interesting and very applicable description. It also has some hits of ripened fruit, caramel, and bread crust. There isnt really any hop flavor and only a very light earthy-herbal bitterness to balance this beer. The beer has a medium to medium-full body and goes down so smoothly and even has a creamy mouthfeel/texture to it. I thoroughly enjoyed this pint and discovered that it went down very easily and very quickly! Draught at Ladder 19 in Cincinnati, Ohio.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

1351,"2014-11-16",3.1,"on tap @ Old Firehouse / Williamsburg OH --- Clear dark amber, off-white rim head, streaks of lace. Taste is malt that adds bootstrap molasses in the palate, then has carbonation and a little cedar in the swallow to provide a balanced finish. Reasonable, but there are better examples out there (and who said this is a Scottish Ale?)","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"
