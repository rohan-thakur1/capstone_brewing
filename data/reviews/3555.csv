3555,"2016-12-17",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2016 They bottled this once about 3 years ago. I found a bottle at my mothers house and we opened and drank it. Good but when I had it at the brewery... (this rate)... so much better. Cloudy white/cream. Very little head. Lime, seawater, light biscuit. The taste hits you sideways. Tart lemon and fresh salt in abundance. Long salty finish. A work of art. Blown away.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

3555,"2014-01-13",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2014 My Bottom Line:
An intelligent interplay of coriander and salt leads to moderate tartness in this cohesive and highly personable Gose.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam protects the cloudy pale yellow-white.
-The flavour profile is balanced.
-This is perfectly authentic. I am looking forward to trying it out in a blind tasting with the Ritterguts and Bayerischer Bahnhof versions.
-My only bad with this beer would be that the carbonation could be pricklier, especially in the tap version.
-This is screaming for many Thaï dishes.

3555,"2013-07-14",3.4,"7/10/13. Hazy pale yellow pour with a small, frothy off-white head. Pool water/chlorine, acidict sourness, and light wheat malts in the aroma. The flavor is sour, lightly tart, soft wheat malts, and a light hint of salt and spice. Much tastier than the aroma led on, but disappointing as far as others ratings would seem to suggest. In this and many of their lighter beers, I got a distinct chlorine and mineral/metallic aspect out of the brews.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
