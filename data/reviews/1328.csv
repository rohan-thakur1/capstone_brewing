1328,"2015-10-03",3.8,"2oz bomber pours with an amber to brown colored body that supports a light mocha head of foam. The modest aroma offers up earthy malts, sweet malts, toasted bread and then vague sweet smelling dark fruity esters. The taste starts with sweet malts, a dash of chocolate and earthy sweet maltiness. It delves into some sweet prune and molasses like sweetness to midway. In the background lurks thin ribbons of vague bitter hops. Pretty solid.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

1328,"2014-11-19",3.6,"~Bready, toasty, slightly roasty malt character. Floral earthy hops with light citrus notes
~Pours a slightly hazy amberish brown color with big lasting creamy off white head.
~Strong malty character of bread and light roast, balanced with a healthy dose of earthy and slightly citrusy hops. Taste more like an amber than a Scottish ale to me.
~medium full bodied, medium low CO2, sweet than light roasty finish that lingers.
~Very well balanced and enjoyable beer. Alcohol is hidden very well. I could drink a lot of these","Lincoln, California, USA","Oscbert"
1328,"2014-10-08",3.0,"Poured from the bomber into my Rubicon shaker. Dark mahogany color with a dense tan head. Aroma is roasty with some smokiness and some sweet chocolate notes. Even though this beer wasnt super cold, it started off sickeningly sweet and artificial tasting. Letting it warm some was critical!!! Once this warmed up and was actually drinkable, there was some mild sweetness up front, with some nuttiness and some vegetable flavor I cant put my finger on, as well as some roasted malt, and a touch of smoke. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall this was ok, but definitely not great. From the other reviews it sounds like this one might be best on tap...","Elk Grove, California, USA","bnoel09"
1328,"2014-04-21",3.0,"Dark amber, caramel color. Dark cherry aroma. Caramel malt taste with faint bitterness. Mouthfeel inadequate for a scottish ale: Quick finish and no lingering sweetness.","Reno, Nevada, USA","jahouse"
1328,"2014-04-13",4.0,"Pours a finger and half of head on a dark red/straw colored body. Looks great.
The aroma is rich grain with a multitude of spice. 
The taste is malt sweetness that is tempered mid-way by lemon bitterness. Great balance.
The texture is soft with moderate carbonation.
This is one of the more drinkable Scottish that Ive had.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
1328,"2013-07-21",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2014 Tap at the brewpub. Pours dark brown with orange glints and a creamy beige head. Light malty aroma. Near full bodied. Flavor is malty, toffeeish, and theres a little smoke trailing along. Finishes malty, somewhat bitter, but more on the sweet side. Drinks well. Re-rate: Wouldnt change a thing.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1328,"2013-06-01",3.6,"On tap at Davis BeerFest. Pours dark brown with an attractive beige head and a sweet smoky aroma. There is a full-bodied smoked malt flavor with a slightly sweet finish. Sticks to the palate.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1328,"2013-05-16",3.3,"16 ounce sample at Rubicon.  The aroma is more roasted than I would expect, with light sweetness.  Lightly herbal hop aromas are also present.  Some cereal is also there.  Transparent mahogany body with light garnet hues.  Medium light tan head.  Starts with light roastiness before it becomes a little sweet with some toffee hints.  Finishes with a light herbal bitterness.  Nice, chewy body.  A good beer, but not entirely a classic version of the style.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
