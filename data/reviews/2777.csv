2777,"2013-03-16",4.2,"On tap, second trip to Nota Bene. Nice clear copper-bronze pour with beautiful head. Elegant roasted grain aroma, light caramel notes, burnt caramel, candied sugar, very clean no yeast, no fruity fermentation notes. Nice toasted grain flavour, again very clean. light caramel sweetness. Dry palate, medium carbonation, on the high side for the style. No difficulty identifying this polotmave as a fine representative of what the style is and should be.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2777,"2013-03-10",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
This silky Polotmavé shares a beautifully-defined caramel malt and herbal hop profile from aroma to finish .

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam stays atop the shiny dark-amber copper.
-Mouthfeel is rather lean, yet not dry.
-The herbal hop bitterness leaves enough room for the malts the shine even in the aftertaste.
-Everything is harmonious and well-rendered : this is a quintessential Polotmavé.

On tap at Nota Bene, Praha.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2777,"2013-03-10",2.5,"Pours in dark ruby with no head at all. The aroma is malty, little bit yeasty with some earthiness. Taste is quite sweet, too much for my taste of this style. Some smokiness in the background, well balanced. Body is flat, almost no carbonation. Good bye Mr. Havel. ;)","CZECH REPUBLIC","mmahut"
