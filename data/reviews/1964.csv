1964,"2011-01-26",3.4,"From notes:

Pours pitch black and almost completely opaque with slight mahogany edges when held to a light source and a two finger frothy, dark mocha head. Good retention, slowly fading into a lasting ring that leaves splotches of lacing behind.

Roasted malt aroma with hints of chocolate, coffee bean, oatmeal and licorice. Slightly spicy with a surprisingly prominent earthy pine hop presence in the nose.

Medium bodied and surprisingly hop forward for the style. Lots of bitter earthy pine flavor up front that lingers throughout over the roasted malt body into a lingering bitter, dry finish. Theres a slight lactic cream presence that balances things out a bit but the flavor is dominated by the hops and roasted malt flavor. Hints of coffee/espresso bean, dark chocolate and burnt toast.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1964,"2010-01-08",4.1,"In short: An original roasted and very herbaceous stout.  Very interesting.
How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed when about 6 months of age.  Sent to me by after4ever, thanks a lot Tom.
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head
In long: The original wicked nose is very herbaceous with also leafy hops and medium roastiness.  Taste is also very herbaceous.  Ive had my share of stouts over the years but its the first time come across one that has that strong herbaceous character (like toasted green tea or something) as the main attraction.  Also burnt toasts, toasted wood, earthy notes, some roasted coffee beans, a bit of black chocolate, dried tobacco leafs, black liquorice.  Finish is rather dry and leaves a long herbal after-taste.  Lively body/carbonation.  This is both a highly drinkable session stout and an original one.

The aroma picked up a hefty dose of molasses to complement dark chocolate and sticky caramel.. lots of roast throughout and enough character to approximate an imperial stout.  The flavor opened with pine and citric bitterness that was followed by a rich array of well-roasted dark maltage (dark chocolates, coffee, and molasses primarily).. lively bitterness again on the back that cut into and complemented the roast factor.. warm finish with pine and sticky dark malts.  Medium-plus bodied with enough carbonation to keep it moving across the palate (some sharp prickly notes on the sides)..

1964,"2008-05-16",3.1,"A vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a three-finger thick, frothy, deeply browned, tan colored head that sits on top of an almost black, concentrated, dark brown stained beer that is quite opaque.  Quite sweet and fruity smelling, in fact it has some similarities to fruit loops somehow.  A light mustiness seems to linger just beneath the surface of the aroma too.  The more typical and expected roast notes of a stout are hard to pick out underneath the artificial fruitiness, but if you swirl it nice notes of deeply toasted grain, roasted coffee beans and dusty cocoa aromatics become noticeable.  A sort of cheesy note comes out during the swirling as well though.

Amply roasted in the flavor, from a burnt acidity, to lots of roast malt character.  Finishes with a slight, burnt vegetable note that I find in quite a few heavily roasted beers these days.  Dark espresso flavors and burnt caramel malt notes intermingle at the front of each sip, though these are preceded by a nice, rich chocolate flavor.  Towards the middle and finish the beer picks up a touch of sourness that seems to be a bit more than just roast grain induced.  This beer is thick, rich and chewy feeling with a definite heft that makes this a sipping brew.  The mouthfeel helps to keep the tartness from being too distracting, though it definitely intrudes just a bit.  A bit of the funk from the nose makes its way into the flavor, though it has a much lighter impact, though does become more noticeable towards the finish of each sip (a bit of moldiness is mainly what is noticeable above the slightly suspect tartness).

A decent beer, that has most definitely been infected prior to or at bottling.  Based on this sample I would say this is a beer to be drunk very freshly bottled, which at first blush seems to be the case with most of their bottled products.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1964,"2007-10-18",4.2,"A very dark mocha brown head is thin and fades slowly but fully. The body is totally opaque, ultimate chocolate brown/black with brown edging, very thick looking and hysterically appetizing just from a brief glance. The aroma is no joke and requires many hearty sniffs to even begin to take it all in. Coffee from faraway and remote tiny islands, burned sweet malts, juicy fresh toffee cake, a blend of fresh Slovakian oak and scraped and dried Bordeaux barrel, cherry pits, sun-ripened tangerine rinds, heavily roasted multiple grains, chalky anise, bitter and nearly pure cocoa(awesome!!), mild oats and barely a trace of alcohol. Stunning, menacing and adorable all at once. The flavor is nearly as delectable. Sweet malt streams right down the middle of the taste, surrounded by light bitterness and plenty of char. Woody notes are lessened, fruit intensified. Mild acidity is spurned from a bitter chocolate component, coffee is steady and pleasing. Vinous character is readily available and monstrously appealing, never overshadowing the desired stout nuances. The finish is warming but not overdone, with lingering roast, coffee, fruit and hints of bitter chocolate and earth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, very slick and very quaffable. This is a tremendous recipe.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

8/22/2007:  Aldergrove Empirical Staught is opaque and very, very dark brown/nearly black in color.  It has a foamy brown head that fades away slowly to leave a lasting crown.

The flavour is just as smooth, and it has a very nice balance between a deep, smooth oat-like feeling, the chocolate, the coffee and the light, roasted bitter finish. Yummi - thank you After4ever/tom for this nice surprise! 2074","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"
1964,"2007-05-02",3.7,"Poured a dark brown color with a small creamy tan head.  The aroma is roasted and fruity like some foreign stouts I had in other countries.   Mild notes of chocolate and smoke.  The flavor has a little more of a bitter roast than the aroma.  No fruitiness but some hops and dark bitter chocolate.  Light side of a medium body.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"

1964,"2007-05-02",3.6,"Pours a mostly opaque black with dark brown edges and a thin, wispy-lacing dark tan head.  Lightly sweet, earthy roasty dark chocolate aroma has a touch of light fruitiness.  Body starts slightly thinner than expected with a touch of sweet caramel before a more drying bittersweet very roasty lingering coffee finsh.  A nice, true to style brew.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1964,"2007-04-29",3.8,"Bottle. Black-slight brown beer with a small dark tan head. Rich toffee malt aroma with slight roast. Caramel malt flavor with big nice roast and slight smoke. A bit of piney hops to back it up. Lingering licorice, coffee, roast, rich malt. Fuller bodied.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
1964,"2007-04-27",4.3,"Smoky amoram wafts above this pitch black brew thick, light brown head.  Very chewy, dense mouthfeel.  Some lactose in the flavor, otherwise tons of roasted malts delight the senses.  Slight vanilla.  This is a very nice brew!  André, thanks amigo.","Rochester, New York, USA","JahNoth"
1964,"2007-02-24",3.9,"Bottle courtesy of bitbucket.  Bottle capping and label looks like homebrew.  Beer drinks much bigger than its 7.5% ABV.  Very nice, roasty malt flavors.  Drinks much like arcadia Imp Stout.  Very nice brew.","Freeport, Georgia, USA","jimbowood"
1964,"2007-01-06",3.9,"Bottled. Pours an almost completely opaque black with a thin tan head. Full creamy body with light carbonation. Aroma has vanilla, molasses and chocolate going for it. Plenty more sweet dark chocolate in the taste, plus coffee. A touch of smoke and piney bitterness in the finish. Nice!","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"
1964,"2006-07-22",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2007 Bottle Pours a very dark deep black.  Almost oily.   Thick robust milk chocolate colored foamy head.   Aroma is dark chocolate, tootsie roll and and slightly alcohol fumey.  Flavor is bittersweet chocolate and light charcoal with some coffee.  Feel is moderatly heavy, but slick. Rather soft carbonation for the head that was produced.  Late woody, bitterness.

1964,"2006-07-09",3.8,"Oil colored body w. a rich, full chocolate head. Light chocolate tones lick the olfactory senses as the full roast coffee and deep chocolate flavors sink in, perhaps deepened   in complexity by the touch of alcohol on the back of the palate.  A superb stout and a great find.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
1964,"2006-06-27",3.7,"Bottle: Black in color, moderate to large light brown foamy head, fairly nice lacing.   Malty nose, roasty, with notes of chocolate but unfortunately also some barn or pasture.   Its somewhat earthy in that aspect.   Extremely malty, very low hop profile, slight chocolate and roasted malts, but again I am getting that somewhat pasture like flavor (wet muddy grass).   Very slight pine/hop emerges as it warms, but its more sweet than bitter.   Lingering roasted malt and cocoa notes.   A touch of charred wood or campfire also resides in there, along with a bit of fruit skin.   Moderate to full body and mouthfeel.   Aside from that pasture/barnish aspect, it was pretty enjoyable.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
1964,"2006-06-21",3.9,"Pours opaque black with a thin tan head.  The nose has some harsh smoke, but its mostly sweet fruits, with an emphasis on something thats on the tip of my brain, but I cant quite place.  I think its mollassas, but yet my brain, upon the aroma hitting my olfactory receptors, keeps almost flashing back to my eating or drinking something with the same aroma.  Unfortunately, I just cant get there....

In the mouth, theres more of that flavor, along with a little sourness to start.  It then finished smoky and slightly sweet.  Im not a huge fan of smoked beers (even if Oakes says that makes me abnormal), but this one doesnt overdo it.  The aftertaste is of dark, almost bittersweet chocolate.  A plesant surprise.  I picked this one up at Bottleworks on a whim (Ill try almost any new local brew), assuming it would be mediocre; however, its quite good.","Seattle, Washington, USA","acertain"
1964,"2006-06-01",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2006 From the bottle. 
Pours a very dark black with a short-lived tan/brown head. On the nose, some chocolate, a hint of grape, a hint of smoke.  Flavor is close to being really good, but its heavy on some some vinous notes; on the positive side we get  semisweet chocolate awith hints of anise and pumpernickel tones yielding to  a deep bitter chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth and quite full given the 7.5% ABV. 
I was pleasantly surprised with my first bottle, and while this second bottle isnt quite as good as remembered, I still see this one as a contender.

1964,"2006-05-28",3.9,"12-oz. Pours a light-absorbing black, with a thick, dense, tan head thats gone by the time you walk across the room and take a sip. Roasty, dusty, bittersweet chocolate nose. Creamy, velvety mouth with good carb and nice thick body. Very much to the sweet side, with licorice and chocolate showing through the smoke and roast. Nice little lingering bitter finish. Good beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1964,"2006-05-22",2.5,"Dark black with a frothy brown head. Aroma of chocolate, smoke and licorice. Very nice. Hints of the alcohol come through in the aroma. Hmmm....this has a very sharp/bitter bite on first sip....ruins the beer for me actually. Reminds me of a slight vinegar taste..highly disapointed in the taste after smelling this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
1964,"2006-05-18",3.4,"Pretty damn black.  Smokey, tarry, nutty aroma.  Smooth, thick, oily body.  Rich and decadent sweet chocolate, with accents of smoke, roast and charred roast beef.  Massive flavour.  Late alcohol, roasty sting, fairly dry.  The intensity is brisk, the balance a bit off.  The overall package is not spectacular, but this has some things going for it...it has a certain appeal though I could see some folks not liking this much at all.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
