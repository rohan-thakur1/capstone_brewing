3997,"2015-03-16",3.2,"ENG: Vintage 650ml bottle (not sure how old, probably around a year), poured into the tulip. Very dark brown color, small beige head. Very nice and deep aromas of chocolate, caramel, hops (!), coffee. Taste is a bit watery with hints of roasted caramel, malts, coffee, bread, dried plum. No hops at all (obviously). Not too much of bitterness if any. Maybe a bit in the aftertaste, which is mostly coffeeish. Low carbonation, medium body, and as I mentioned above - a bit watery. Overall tastes more like a coffee stout to me, probably thats because it was aged, so the whole hops and carbonation disappeared, and sweetness came upon top. So Ive drank it more for a curiosity. Nice experience though.
PL: Wyleżakowana butelka 650ml (nie do końca jestem pewien jak długo leżakowała, ale coś ok. roku), przelana do kieliszka. Bardzo ciemna, brunatna barwa, niewielka, beżowa piana. Bardzo fajne, głębokie aromaty czekoladowe, karmelowe, chmielowe (!), kawowe. W smaku nieco wodniste, z nutami palonego karmelu, słodów, kawy, chleba, suszonych śliwek. Brak chmielu (oczywiste). Nie za wiele goryczki, o ile w ogóle. Może nieco w posmaku, który jest głównie kawowy. Niskie nasycenie, średnie odczucie w ustach, no i jak już wspomniałem - dość wodniste. Podsumowując piwo przypomina w smaku coffee stouta, ale to pewnie przez to, że było leżakowane i cały chmiel i nasycenie uciekły, a wyszły słodkie smaki. Także piłem to piwo z czystej ciekawości.

A fairly enjoyable black IPA, with a lighter body than the dark colour would suggest. Gotta say, Ive been reasonably pleased with my sampling of Half Pints so far - seems like a solid brewery. But, though Im definitely getting the tropical fruit notes of the Galaxy hops in this one, Im convinced theres a runaway brett infection on top of everything - which probably explains the unmanageable head. I did a little research, and it seems like this thing was brewed only once - three years ago! Seriously? A three year old IPA? Dammit, people, why cant you date your bottles? Whats this supposed to taste like? Who knows? Its OK as-is, but I have no idea if it bears any resemblance to what it was and/or what it was intended to be. (12/20)","CANADA","UXO"

3997,"2012-09-17",4.0,"In short: An exemplary Black IPA.  That simple
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh, 1.5 month after the beer release.  Bottle from Savvy1982, thanks a lot Kyle
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head leaving good lacings on the glass
In long: The inviting nose is dominated by the hops aroma (piney and tropical fruits) over a slice of chocolate cake.  Taste is roasted but not overly so, plenty of blackened cake malts, a bit chocolaty, a sip of black coffee.  Basically a very satisfying malt backbone for that type of beer.  Then a solid hopping but not a hop-bomb, with such a solid malt backbone this beer is more a well balanced Black IPA than a hophead wet dream.  The nice tasty hops provide piney and tropical fruits flavors.  A nice clean and refreshing bitterness of medium intensity, tasty bitterness but nothing resinous here,.  This is clearly one of the better Black IPA I have had, certainly in my top-10 of the style.  A good beer like this puts me in such a good mood, it makes me want to hug someone that doesnt get on my nerves until he/she says please let me go, I dont know you because everybody I know get on my nerves,  An actual Black Galaxy (or the more politically correct terminology galaxy of color) is a galaxy oppressed by the white universe that steels stars from regular luminous galaxies.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3997,"2012-08-10",3.6,"Courtesy of dcschiller. It pours mahogany with a tan head of foam. The aroma offers up malt balls, spicy wood, like notes, flower pedals and roasted malts. The taste has spicy notes from hops like pine and then sort of a cedar wood sensation followed by dark roasted malts and a bit of coffee and chocolate. It has pleasing levels of both roasted malts and hops. Pretty bold in flavor yet pretty thin in palate with the various notes being on the bright side. I would think a year in the cellar will smooth and meld these flavors into harmony.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Absolutely, unmistakably the best Half Pints beer Ive had to date, and Ive had just about every last one. This honestly has shades of the Hill Farmstead Black IPA I had a few months back. Thats how good this is. Nose is exceptional, with quince, perfume, grapefruit, anise/fennel, and just a perfect amount of roast backing it up.

Ahhhh the scent! Ive said in older reviews that I love a black IPA in which the black malts share equal billing with the hops,otherwise whats the point of it being black when all you can taste and smell are hop oils? This beer nails that balance: on the nose, rich chocolatey malts intermingle beautifully with citrus, pine, and blackberry notes. Wow. Im smelling it again right now... On the palate, the marriage remains blissful, with cocoa, espresso, guava, grapefruit, and yes, a ghostly blackberry note all preceding a pithy assertively bitter finish.

I can see a few really small carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. The nose is fruity at first glance with sweet resins, grapefruit, floral hops, citrus zest and a subtle earthy note. A deeper sniff and I get a dark roasted malt with a torrefaction coffee note, big pine needle notes and a hint of dark chocolate. Putting the glass down I get a big French espresso whiff off the top on the head. Smells utterly delicious. Sipping slowly, the middle has a sweet malt with chocolate milk and americano being evident with a hint of licorice. The roast and the hops take over and bring a not overly strong bitterness, but it carries on forever in the aftertaste. Mildly dry on the finish with a big roast and tangy grapefruit flavours playing some sort of complex harmony together. The body is a bit thin, but this is a remarkable and truly exceptional beer. Later on I get a tangy and pine filled palate minutes after drinking...it really lingers on.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"
3997,"2012-04-01",3.8,"Well - if all Black IPAs smelled and tasted like this Id be a bigger fan. Poured out pretty much totally black with a small foamy tan head that settles quickly and leaves some mess. Initially the coffee aroma greeted me with distain but these damn citrus hops just crush it. How they got all blended up so well is beyond me. There be some chocolate too. Damn this Leffe glass - always sucks balls for reviewing - it was either this glass or a frying pan. Interestingly enough Im not even sure if I am smelling coffee anymore. Its a new aroma for me and its taking a bit to figure out. Grapefruits, tropical things with a minor soap quality (but not soapy), mellow pine and fair sized roasted malts. K - This is almost lame to say but with a glass this big and some hard swirls I actually created a very cool multi-shaded swirl pattern in the head.. pretty cool and pretty nerdy at the same time. And Ferfie hit the minty chocolate thing on the head. Here and there I do get a very fresh blast of pine needles that fade quickly. By brew is constantly covered with a cover that never leaves the surface clean. The flavour is pretty good and pretty damn bitter but not a pure palate wrecker. My girls just cant seem to get enough of listening to Powerslave by Iron Maiden today - thats freaking cool. Big grapefruit and pine pounding with a healthy dose of bitterness and roasted malts to attempt to keep everything under control. There isnt a lot of depth to the flavour but things do come in waves and linger well. Fairly well carbonated, nice mouthfeel, long and hard bitter finish with roasty bits peering out here and there under the tsunami of bitterness that now exists. Weird ass nose burps too.

Ive had several Black IPAs, but this is the very first Ive had from Half Pints. Im glad I got my hands on it. It has a very big OOMPH of a grapefruitiness from the hops. Incredibly hoppy, but you would know that already if you are familiar with Half Pints other ""IPA"" beers. 

It has a bit of toastiness in the taste, as well as a continuation of the very citrusy Grapefruit in the hops. Incredibly hoppy. This Black IPA reminds me more of an actual IPA than most Black IPAs, I find most Black IPAs Ive tried remind me more of an IPA meets porter, this one reminds me of a very very dark IPA.
