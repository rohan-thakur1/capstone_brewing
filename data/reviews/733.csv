733,"2015-12-12",3.6,"On tap at the Fermentaria. Pours a hazed somewhat murky looking brown with a thin tanned white head. Smells like brewing  big thick malt, soft oatmeal, cocoa, roast, musk and hops. Medium bodied, malt and toast, warm and chewy. Smooth malt into a delicate hop bitterness on the finish. Long malt on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

733,"2015-10-20",4.0,"Missed this one back in the day, glad to see it on again. On cask, pours light brown with ultra creamy and full head. Nice lace. Notes of malt, pine, rye, green earth, and brown ale stuff. Medium bodied. Balanced and crushable.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
733,"2015-10-19",3.6,"On tap at Fermentaria. Poured a brown color with a smaller sized off white head. Caramel, grain, earthy, lighter roast, and some bread.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
733,"2015-10-14",3.0,"LSAT Freedom Trip #185. Keg at the Fermentaria. Murky brown, large foamy tan head, good retention. Aroma of herbal, resin, piney hops, caramel. The taste is citrus, tropical hops, caramel malt, hints of chocolate. Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
733,"2015-10-03",3.7,"Draft at the Fermentaria with Linh. Pours a hazy brown with white lace. Aroma is fresh hop and nutty bread. Mouthfeel is actively carbonated and medium bodied with notes of pine hop, clean fruity malt, fresh Irish brown bread and sweet nut.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
733,"2015-10-02",3.5,"On tap on 10/2/15. Pours a super cloudy brown with a thin light tan head. Looks like dirt water or watery Nesquik. Smell is hoppy, nice. Taste is basically an ipa but a bit toasty/nuttier. I guess that's what it's billed as. Good but not great. Would prefer an ipa or a brown ale. Still very much preferred over a lot of other mediocre renditions.

733,"2012-07-13",3.5,"Dark chestnut pour, grainy hops on the nose with earthy malts.  Mouth is fresh roasted grains and bright hops throughout.  Very rustic feel, edgy rye touch is nice, though the flavors are quite muddled and its just not very bright or nuanced.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
733,"2012-06-29",3.9,"Pours a deep dark brown with a thick white head. Aroma of roasty malts and hops. Taste follows with rich caramel notes. This is a very complex beer, a nice surprise.

733,"2012-06-26",3.8,"Chestnut brown with red hues, medium long-lasting tan head , and notable lacing.  Aroma begins with roasted nuts, caramel malt, and bakers chocolate before pleasant citrus notes introduce themselves.  Flavor is similarly filled with an enjoyable blend of roasted malt and nut with citrus and pine hops.  Medium mouthfeel before a dry finish that leaves flavors lingering on the palate.  Very enjoyable brown ale that almost reminds of a tame black IPA.","Mamaroneck, New York, USA","RoyalFlushing"
733,"2012-06-14",3.8,"On tap at Tired Hands.  Pours a medium brown color with a nice off-white head and some spotty lacing.  The nose carries some nice earthy undertones along with some mild chocolate and toasted bread.  Over the top of that is a nice bit of pine resin and citrus hops.  Flavor adds in a nice bitter edge to go with a nice bit of hop flavor overlaying the malt base.  Medium body and a fairly-dry finish.  Quite nice.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
733,"2012-06-13",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2013 Medium to dark brown with slight hints of red.  Moderate sized pale brown head.  Spotty lacing.  Surprisingly hoppy (I wasnt paying attention to the description at the time) with a rich nutty and earthy malt base, mild chocolate, and hints of citrus.  Flavor is similar with the malts and the citric hops playing back and forth.  Ive rarely encountered a hoppy brown ale that Ive truly liked--and this is getting as close to as Ive found.  Medium to full bodied.  Assertive carbonation.  Slick on the tongue.  A bit rounded in the finish.  Ill probably revisit to see if this grows on me.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
733,"2012-06-09",4.4,"Pours an opaque brown with a medium tan head...lively looking...nice lacing and retention.  Aroma has nice citrusy notes with light pine and a bit of malty roastiness.  Flavor has touches of nuttiness and dry leaves with great pine and citrus...good bitterness.  Motuhfeel is light/medium and lively with a dry bitter/spicy finish.  Fabulous!","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
733,"2012-06-02",4.0,"Pours ruby brown amber unclear with a decent creamy sandy head. The aroma brings pleasant citrus hops over a bit of earthy malts and yeast. The carbonation out of the growler is just right, bringing a creamy and lightly spiced body. The flavors of citrus and pine hops are quite nice with a dryer ending. There is still a balance of the malts blended so well not coming out too sweet.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

A brown ale is a brown ale is a brown ale, or so I usually think. That said, this delivers on what I look for in a brown, much like HF George, but a little less hoppy. Pouts a cloudy dark brown with a retentive khaki head. Nutty and chocolately nose, very nice rich malt blend with a slightly sweet tropical hop sweetness. Flavor follows with a strong malt body and nutty finish with tropical hop bitterness. Full body, creamy, high carbonation. Its a good brown ale, what else to say.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"
