1736,"2017-06-12",4.0,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/22/2017. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, brown sugar, toasted brown bread, light herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of coffee, roast/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big nutty dark roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, brown sugar, toasted brown bread, light herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal hop and roasted coffee bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of nutty dark roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, brown sugar, toasted brown bread, light herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of coffee, roast/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Minimal dryness from hop/roast bitterness. Very clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-medium carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/silky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.5%. Overall this is a great coffee lager! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of coffee, roast/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mildly bitter finish. Awesome vibrant coffee complexity, with great malt balance. Feels kind of midway between a Vienna Lager and Schwarzbier on style. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1736,"2017-06-06",2.7,"This is like a coffee. Plus some beer. If this was a rap song it would be called Coffee, feat. Beer. Pours brown with good head. Bitter finish. Tap at Savor.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
1736,"2017-05-31",4.0,"Bottle from Merchants. Aroma is coffee, more like fresh beans than brewed, some earthy bitterness, but very roasty. Appearance is amber brown, light tan head. Taste is coffee. Taking a bite out of fresh coffee beans. Light chocolate, light earthy bitterness, but just in your face coffee, excellent. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light carbonation, coffee bean aftertaste. Overall, I like this a whole lot.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
1736,"2016-03-30",3.7,"From notes. I had this one on draft at the brewery on March 18 after a hockey game. The pour is a nice darker brown color that has a thin light tan head that lingers a bit, offering a little lac3e. The aroma is pretty good. It does smell like coffee, as one could hope. There is a hint of chocolate in this one with a light bitterness from the roasted malts. The flavor is definitely heavy in the coffee. This one is just as advertised. There is a nice bitterness associated with the coffee, and the rest of the notes from the nose just fall by the way side here. Its very intensely coffee. The mouth feel is thin and light with a decent carbonation to help it out, but it is almost like a heavy cup of cold coffee. The aftertaste is all bitter roasted coffee with little else helping out. Its not terrible, but you have to really enjoy coffee for this one.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1736,"2016-02-25",3.5,"Tap, Wolverine Tap Room, Ann Arbor, MI. Amber brown. Sweet coffee aroma. Sharp texture. Coffee and maple syrup flavour. Long espresso finish.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","markas101"
1736,"2015-05-17",3.5,"Tap: Ruddy, dark brown, almost black, thin khaki collar recedes to the very edges. Smells & tastes just like cold pressed coffee. Huge, roasted coffee bean aroma & flavor with undercurrents of dark malt sweetness, a hint of cocoa, roast, & some very mild caramel in the back-end. But mostly just coffee, all day & all night. A pretty nice balance of bitterness & sweetness, too, without leaning out of kilter at any time. Maybe just a touch watery in the end, but still a nice beer.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
1736,"2015-02-05",3.5,"Sampled at MBG Fall Beer Fest. It pours a nice dark brown with a mocha colored head. A slightly odd coffee aroma. A solid coffee bitter flavor. Very unique.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"

1736,"2014-10-26",4.0,"On tap: The aroma consists of huge roasted coffee with a touch of chocolate. Its a dark orangish-brown with a small beige head. The flavor starts with a quick dose of chocolate. The finish has moderate-heavy roasted coffee and espresso. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent coffee beer.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

1736,"2013-11-30",4.0,"On tap at the Wolverine tasting room. Poured a brown color with a small sized off white head. Thats what Im talking about - the way a coffee beer should smell! Coffee and roasty. Tastes have coffee, not as strong as the aromas and earthy. But yes, the way I expect a coffee beer!","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1736,"2013-11-12",3.9,"Sample draft at the brewery. Pours brown with ruby highlights and a foamy head that lingers nicely. Aroma is all coffee beans, very nice. Taste is sweet, slightly nutty coffee with just a touch of bitterness. Thin to medium body. Delicious, I slammed the sample.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

1736,"2013-04-07",3.6,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear deep amber brown with a brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a note of coffee with backing dark grains and a hint of toffee. Flavor has much more of an ice coffee note with a touch of chocolate and roast.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1736,"2013-02-28",3.9,"Appreciable in that there is very little to fight the aroma and flavor of coffee.  Indeed, it actually smells like straight black coffee.  Very little viscosity.  Easy drinking and yummy, especially for a coffee nut.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","gonzosauce"
