3076,"2017-05-03",4.2,"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a light beige, bubbly and fluffy head.

Smoke is huge on the nose - burned wood, stale earth, roasted grains and sweet caramel form an intriguing force, enhanced by a whiff of sea salt. A small dose of dried herbs compliment to the profound malts, establishing a pleasant depth.

Has a medium body with a slightly lower carbonation, which is still able to produce a light effervescence during the finish, countering a green tea hop bitterness. Although the smoke and maltiness are both profound, the mouthfeel remains refreshingly light.

Tastes of a bakers chocolate covered toffee peak, gently entangled into earth, wood bark and a ridiculous amount of sweet and heavy smoke. Turns a little sweeter during mid palate with rock sugars enriching the malts, toned down by dry and herbal hops. Finishes surprisingly bitter with some lingering smoke and a well exhibited rustic malt sweetness.

Flavour is much less aggressively smoky than I expected, medium-sweet malt with light caramel and sweet tea, citrus, soft toasted wood, dry smoky quality, light savoury meat notes, drying into the finish with light bitterness of toasted wood and noble hops. Medium bodied, slick and slightly sticky, with very low carbonation and no alcohol heat.

3076,"2017-01-04",3.9,"Piwo o miedzianej barwie, całkowicie klarowne. Piana jest jasnopomarańczowa, średnio obfita, zbudowana ze średniej wielkości oczek, które w dodatku jeszcze rosną, pękają, a piana opada i po kilku chwilach nic po niej nie pozostaje. Aromat? Po pierwszym zaciągnięciu się tuż po odkapslowaniu butelki aż otworzyłem oczy szerzej z wrażenia! Intensywna, bukowa, szynkowo-kiełbasiana dymność jest na pierwszym planie. Coś pięknego dla zwolenników wędzonych piw, tym bardziej, że ta wędzonka jest trwała i nie ulatuje od razu. Pod spodem czuć trochę karmelu, który udanie komponuje się z wędzonką. W smaku również wędzonka wychodzi na pierwszy plan, ale tutaj wtóruje jej wyraźna ziołowa goryczka, jest też nuta przypieczonej skórki od chleba. Wysycenie jest niskie, co najwyżej między niskim a średnim, i dobrze pasuje do tego piwa, sprawia, że przyjemnie się je pije. Alkohol jest dobrze ukryty, niewyczuwalny. Piwo jest treściwe, choć nie gęste. Rauchbock to jeden z moich ulubionych stylów, choć przede wszystkim lubię te, które są bardzo ""rauch"" i tutaj właśnie z takim mam do czynienia.

The smokey flavors are definately present in the flavor but less than I expected. It has some saltiness to it besides the sweetness. Very strange taste to me. Takes me some getting used to. Tastes kind of like a cola with smoked salty ham and champagne. Definately original to my palate but have yet to enjoy it. I have to say I like their original rauchbeer much more.

3076,"2016-12-28",4.3,"Bière ambrée/rousse avec de jolis reflets topaze, transparente et sans aucune mousse résiduelle. Nez comme attendu sur le fumé, le bacon, la charcuterie, le chêne... Lalcool est bien perceptible, en plus dêtre fumés les malts sont bien torréfiés, avec de grosses notes de caramel, de chocolat au lait, de sirop dérable. Difficile cependant de retrouver du fruit, hormis des notes de fruits secs, de raisin, de pruneau... Le nez nest pas extrêmement complexe mais ces arômes de bacon fumé sont une merveille quand on boit cette bière avec du saucisson sec, de la viande des grisons etc. La carbonatation est assez faible, la texture huileuse et lalcool bien soutenu malgré un 8% plutôt modeste. Bonne amertume avec le côté fumé, pointe de sécheresse au palais plutôt agréable et bien équilibré. Lalcool est liquoreux et soutient bien lensemble. Les bouches suivantes sont plus douces, dans les sucres, les malts et le côté vineux. La fumé masque beaucoup darômes et de saveurs mais on sent derrière que la base brassicole est très bonne. On retrouve les notes de raisin et de pruneau, mais aussi de liqueur de poire. Le final est profond, la fumé faisant son office pendant de très longues secondes, avec des grosses notes de tabac, de bois résineux, de terre et de cuir, un peu à la manière dun whisky tourbé. Evidemment, les bières fumées sont réservées aux amateurs du genre mais cette Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche Doppelbock en est sans doute un des meilleurs ambassadeurs.

3076,"2016-11-04",4.6,"Dark, rich, semi-opaque/cloudy brown with a medium white head. On the nose: immediately bacon jumps out followed by a strong scent of honey-glazed ham, smoky/toasty malts, and certainly some oak. Starts off slightly sweet & smoky and moves onto a savory flavor just like a bite of honey-glazed ham. The mid-palate also has some creamy malts and hops as well. The finish is where you get the oak smoke and a tiny bit of alcohol showing. The smoke & ham flavors faintly stay on your tongue even after a few minutes between sips. When it warms up, the aroma is sweeter...like brown sugar and dark fruits. There are some tosted nuts, sugary sweetness, and cacao flavors that stand out, too. It becomes generally sweeter and creamier as it warms up, holding back the savory and smoky parts for the finish. The complex flavors are maintained throughout the drinking session. Very full-bodied with a very dry finish. Medium carb; smooth & warming. Ultimately, this beer is uniquely savory; like other beers from Schlenkerla, this ones pretty much a BBQ in a glass. With that said, though, this beer is absolutely deliciousI enjoyed it more and more with each sip and could barely put it down to write my thoughts.

This doesnt quite hit the heights of the Urbock for me (well, the Urbock of a decade ago; a re-visit is probably in order), but its still quite excellent in its own right and Im loathe to knock it much for small flaws when it remains a superb example of the style.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

A couple of weeks ago, I said that the Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier might be an excellent place for neophytes to begin exploring Rauchbiers, given its overall quite mellow character. Well, thats still true, but this one might be an even better first Rauchbier. The oak smoke seems milder than the beech smoke, and its also slightly less evocative of smoked-cured meat. Not radically different than the Fastenbier, but just as good - and, interestingly, the much higher ABV is really not any more apparent than the much lower (5.5%) of the Fastenbier.

The smell had some rich sweet smoked malts roaming over some light nutty character. Light caramel and toasty notes balance in nicely.
The taste was mainly sweet with the smoke coming in for the balance. Theres a slight smoky sweet aftertaste clinging on into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a nice sessionability about it. It gets creamy sweet yet shows a nice sticky clingy but not cloying feel on my tongue.
Overall, what a wonderful ""smoked"" beer close to a doppelbock. Id have again and wouldnt mind with its respected food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

The aroma is not as overtly smoky as the marzen rauchbier rendition, more of a subtle burnt oaky aroma with the standard chocolate malt present. The appearance is unusually lighter and more transparent for the D-Bock style, and the white head receded more quickly, so it seemed. In addition to the forward smoky taste, there is a warm and delicious chocolate and rich caramel maltiness, definitely recognizable as a D-bock with an almost maple syrup-like taste. Interesting and enjoyable, and I do believe the smoke complements the chocolate well to create a s'mores-like taste, although I would prefer an unsmoked D-Bock to this.

3076,"2015-07-15",3.7,"Bottle drunk 7/9/15Well before even pouring this thing, the aroma seeping forth is a thoroughly enjoyable mix of blissful bacony-meaty goodness. Im guessing that this is ingrained in to this brewerys offerings at this point, as they claim in the commercial description that this is ""smoother and more [subtle] than the more intensely aromatic beech smoke malt"" which it certainly is not. This is the same great, malty, rich, meaty smokiness that we know and love. Its pretty preposterous to imagine that anyone but a seasoned woodsman or professional wood smoker could tell the difference in what wood was used. Even the temperature of the heat and seasoning of the wood would throw serious curveballs, not to mention adding it to a god damned beer! So, gimmicky? Undoubtedly. Wonderfully aromatic? Absolutely. The malt is certainly felt, richly sweet, with light melanoidins adding boisterous berries and though theres isnt a ton of dryness, the wood character itself mixes with some peppery phenols from the smoke to help lend some balance. No alcohol or flaws noted.Rich, chewy, heavily viscous maltiness is entwined with bacon-like smokiness up front, growing quite heavily sweet through the middle before a reprieve of vinous, melanoidin-rich acidity and dry wood char helps break it apart somewhat on the end. The sweetness creeps back in, especially with more warming, and the lower-than-usual carbonation for this brewery dosent help either. That being said, the smoked character is peerless, as always, and the acidic flavors almost save the day. As their biggest beer by a good margin, its a little more forgivable that this one be their most decadent and while its too sweet for me, ultimately, its easily taken as a dessert beer if youre in the mood/market for that.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3076,"2015-02-14",3.9,"Appearance: Dark transparent bronze and brown colored body with a fluffy off-white eggshell colored head that stands up pretty good.

Aroma: Smells like smoked sausages, a bit of rosemary, and a spicy clove scent. I feel it is important to note that the label does state ""Schlenkerla Oak Smoke"" and the back explains that the malt is kilned with oak wood, which would explain the smoked sausage aroma...so its not a bad thing. It reminds me of summer campfires and cookouts. Its hard to explain why the aroma is so unique and pleasant...it just is.

Taste: Wow there is this caramel sweetness mixed with a hint of smokey flavor. Its not as rich as I would expect from a Doppelbock...a bit thin, but still tasty. Most of the flavor comes from the smokey presence.

Mouthfeel: Despite the smokiness it is not bitter or acrid which is a plus. It does feel rather thin for a Doppelbock, but it is smooth.

Overall: Its a very nice and unique beer especially if you consider the smoke flavor and aroma. For this reason alone I would say give it a shot. Its not the malty sweet caramel Doppelbock you are probably used to, but it is its own beast. The spicy quality of the beer wins a merit on their own. This is a great beer to pair with food. Have fun with it.","","teromous"
3076,"2015-02-11",4.2,"Pours a somewhat cloudy amber with a subtle garnet hue. Normal head volume and retention, outstanding lacing.

Rich nose of bacon cooking over an oak campfire. Underneath is a subtle caramel sweetness. The aroma is less intense than the Marzen and Urbock variants.

Almost full bodied with a rich texture that is oily and creamy. Below normal carbonation level with almost no effervescence in the finish.

The flavor profile is near World Class. It is reasonably intense, a bit complex and exceptionally well balanced. It begins with a burst of oak smokiness that lacks the meaty aspects of the nose, that slowly blends, rather than fades, with a rich underlying sweetness. Both caramel and biscuit notes are present. Here is where the rich malts of a doppelbock kick in. In the middle, a balancing mild bitterness emerges over a vanilla note.

3076,"2015-02-10",4.5,"1 pint .9 oz bottle, poured into a mug at approximately 40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a clear golden red, almost orange-tinted, and forms quite a thick pale beige head that leaves crazy amounts of lacing as it slowly recedes. Bubbles line the bottom of the glass, and rocket upwards sporadically rather than in columns.

Smell: Dark, dank smoke swirls out of the glass, redolent with scents that remind me of a pork shoulder going in my smoker on a spring afternoon. Theres a sweetness underlying the smoke, like caramel. The smoke scent itself, while allegedly oak, reminds me more of burning a mix of peat and hickory.

Taste: Oh my, that is a smooth-drinking beverage. The taste opens with a sweet caramel malt that seems to have been aged in oak barrels, which is suddenly overtaken in the middle by the taste of fire-blackened pork still dripping with fat. As it progresses, the meaty essence gives way first to charred and ashy wood, and by the finish, to a peaty soot. While there are allegedly Hallertau hops present, I can find no hop character to this beer (which is a plus for me), beyond the slight earthy-peaty tone to some of the smoke. There is no indication at all that this contains alcohol, just sweetness and smoke.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and quite drinkable, this feels like silk along the palate.

Overall: My first encounter with a Schlenkerla, and assuredly not my last. While the label says ""doppelbock"", Id call this more of a rauchbier, as the primary characteristic is the smoke - theres nowhere near the level of bready, toffee, caramel, nutty, or dark fruit flavors I would associate with a doppelbock, nor the sticky mouthfeel.

Deciding to re-rate as it smells amazing. Beautiful deep ruby orange colour with brilliant clarity. The head is a little orange and lasts and lasts. Amazing smoked ham aroma with a tiny hint of tobacco. On tasting, the texture is silky smooth with fine carbonation and a high quality smoked ham flavour.

The aroma is an amazing -- AMAZING -- peat smoke. Brings me flashbacks to childhood campfires. Smoked bacon and grilled meats. If you didnt know this was a beer, you might think your nose was over a grill. I cant say enough about the aroma: it taps directly into a sense of childhood simplicity, like a carnival or a backyard picnic.

The flavor, again, is smoked meat: bacon and smoky, blackened brisket. Not like a barbecue, but like meat slowly smoked over coals and blackened wood. Its not a spiciness, a la a chipotle ale, but rather like a dry, smoky Rauchbier or a Russian peat-smoked tea.

The feel of the beer is slick and oily. It has a thickness on the back end. I do have to say that this is best consumed in small doses.

NOS : czarna czekolada, toffi, sernik z rodzynkami, banan, drewno, alkohol i dym.

USTA : gęste piwo o mlecznej teksturze. Delikatnie gazowane. Na starcie w ustach piwo ma dosyć wyrazisty słodki smak. Szybko natomiast wyczuwa się kwaskowatość estrów. Nie jest ona przesadna i świetnie wżenia się w całość. Gorzkość nie jest intensywna ale bogata w nuty alkoholowe z dodatkiem pieprzu. Trochę przypomina syrop na kaszel w posmaku. Wędzone nuty są bardzo subtelne ; nie da się ich zapomnieć ale nie dominują smaku. 

ODCZUCIA : jest o piwo wyraźnie z ""wyższej polki"". Bogate ale wymagające. Alkohol jest wyraźny i rozgrzewa od środka. Nuty wędzone są faktycznie inne niż u swoich braci z tego samego browaru ; czuć jest bardziej drewno niż węgiel. Na pewno nie zawaham się spróbować to piwo ponownie.

Smoked ham features but is countered by tar which makes this a bit different than Urbock. Stronger abv suits this beer style well. The palate is medium to full bodied and velvety smooth.

3076,"2013-08-27",4.0,"500ml bottle. Pours a hazy burnished amber, with lots of floating sediment and a small off-white head, which lasts reasonably well and leaves good lacing. Savoury bacon notes mix with smoke, cashews and some sweeter, spicy notes to create the aroma. Mild spice hops up front mix with a touch of smokiness. A sweeter, nutty flavour comes in next, with bacon and jamon iberico flavours dominating the mid-palate. These cured meat flavours persist into the finish, where they are joined by more smoke and an almost floral sweetness. This is much more balanced than Aechts other beers. The oak smoke seems to have a little more sweetness to it than their regular beech smoke. The balance gives lends this beer a little more complexity than many smoked beers, and makes for a very impressive beer indeed.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

3076,"2013-08-01",4.0,"2/10/2011: Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche Doppelbock (Schlenkerla Oak Smoke Double Bock)... Aroma: Has that wonderful, trademark Schlenkerla smokiness (a true rauchbier!) along with a caramlized fruity maltiness that I can only describe as being like heavily caramelized corn on the cob when cooked in the husk over an open fire; this beer smells GREAT! Appearance: Golden yellow color with only a slight haze; roiling carbonation creates a hypnotic effect; dense and lasting head of beige foam. Flavor: Meaty smokiness that nicely balanced with a moderately sweet and malty bockbier; I get some of that caramelized corn on the cob as well (this is meant to describe the nice caramelization and fruitiness; Im not saying that there is any corn in this beer nor does it have any cereal graininess or corn like found in American macro lagers) - actually, maybe a better description is smoked cheese rind!; finish is slightly dry and the alcohol strength is firm, but not overwhelming. Palate: Very smooth and even a bit creamy; medium-full body; good weight and mouthfeel; slightly oily. Overall: Delicious! More smoke is always appreciated, but this is a nicely balanced and approachable smoked beer for those new to the style; the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen is still my favorite though!

The finish shows a hint of meaty smoke ~ dont care for that, but its not overwhelming.  Theres also a touch of spicy hops.  All things considered I liked this a lot more than I thought I would.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

La fumée sévapore dans latmosphère.  Il y a du bois dur et du jambon dans cette bière.  Il y a aussi des effluves de sucre dérable et de sucre dorge.  Ces parfums sont tellement prenants et fabuleux : mon pif se perd pendant un très long moment et rêve de figer dans le temps ce moment assez unique.  Sur les papilles, les saveurs sucrées dansent une longue valse avec des malts fumées viandeux et boisés.  Lalcool est bien maîtrisé et apparaît sous des cultivars poivrés.  Un véritable délice pour les sens.  Je crois reconnaître des notes fruitées derrière ce vibrant ensemble.  En bouche, le liquide montre un corps splendide.  Les bulles sont parfaitement maîtrisées et la texture est huileuse.  Sa finale permet aux notes maltées de se fondre totalement dans un amalgame de notes amères, fumées et piquantes.

But all too ofter the smoke dominates the flavor and the pairing really isnt as nice as Id like.  Maybe its the strength of the oak smoke that does it, but Id prefer a lighter smoke flavor (by about 1/3) to allow those doppel flavors to come out stronger.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"

Strong malt backbone which is expected in a dopplebock but then more salty smoked ham comes through in the flavor.  This brew would be a perfect compliment to lots of food dishes.  Right now it is the perfect compliment to the Wales vs England match for the 6 nations championship.  GREAT MATCH!!!  Light bitterness and dryness in the brew.  Minimal alcohol presence.

The aroma brings campfire, sausage, bacon, smoke. 

The flavor is peaty, smoky, but less wonderful than the standard trio I often drink from this brewery (Urbock, Weizen, Marzen). Grilled meat and a touch of sweet malt.

My biggest complaint is the body, which is quite thin. The feel is smooth on the palate, with low carbonation.

Im familiar with Aecht Schlenkerla rauchbiers, but the aroma on this one is off the charts.  Woah!  Roasty, smoked barbecue flavors - pork, smoky vegetable stew, sweet hickory, campfire.  Also some wood aroma, birch.  Also beneath the dominating smoke is still a readily distinguishable doppelbock aroma, caramel, brown sugar, wet leaves, soft fruit.  Theres also a nuttyness.  You can really get different aromas out of this on almost every sniff as it warms.  Medium bodied, light for 8% (in a good way), nicely warming.  While the same tastes are present in the flavor as in the aroma, here the doppelbock style dominates over the smoke, while both are still distinct.  Finish is lingering smokyness.

3076,"2012-10-28",3.7,"Nearly clear copper pour with a 1 finger, creamy, soapy beige head. Aroma is definitely recognizeable as oak smoke, some light caramel, tobacco (not smoke), old capsite, wet grass, spice and a bunch more awesome smoke. Flavor is sweet and smoky up front, some caramel and malt sweetness, toffee and bready notes, a decent dose of planty and spicy hops and some grilled fruit and bread to the finish. Medium body with a creamy, oily feel throughout and an all around light to moderate carbonation.

Nose is huge rauchy caramel malt, oaky camp fire smoke, and bacon.  I smelled this one as soon as I popped the cap.  Tastes actually somewhat sweet, with a medium body, a lot of smokiness and oakiness, and quite a bit of earthy and fruity flavors (figgy fruit).  Finishes smoky, malty, fruity, and oaky, with a lot of caramel flavor.  This one is unique and excellent.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
3076,"2012-10-15",3.6,"Poured into a perfect pint. The first time I had one of these (the marzen), the smoke was just too damn strong. Since then Ive grown to love the smoke.

3.5 A: Lightly hazed orange amber color. Just a finger of frothy beige head. Retention is below average, but a small ring of lacing is left.

4.5 S: When you smell this, your nostrils get porked. Slow roasted and smoked pork, bacon, campfire all in great balance, but not without plenty of power. Not much else can get passed the smoke, but thats fine since it smells so wonderful.

4.0 T: Again big smokiness with both porcine and campfire components. Sweet caramel from the base along with a robust neutral maltiness and toastiness. A little less smoky than the nose (I can taste the base) but still quite potent. A bit boozy, but nothing out of hand.

3.5 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Light creaminess and a bit syruppy.

3076,"2012-09-23",4.3,"500ml poured into Schlenkerla pint.  Pours a nice amber with a 2-figer thick head.  Particulate residues are present.  Aroma is smoky but less than the urbocks, and the fact that they are using another wood (oak) to smoke their malt is apparent.  Were also definitely in doppelbock territory!  Another thing to be noted, and a bit strange, is the strange perception of ""salt"" in the aroma...never witnessed this before!  Taste is medium-light sweet, less sweet than the urbock, and only slightly bitter.  Body is is medium and texture is slick and hmmm...maybe a little oily.  But it doesnt have the body that the urbock has thats for sure.  Carbonation is soft, very small bubbles here, and actually pretty pleasant.  Finish is medium-long with some bitterness and ashy feeling.  Overall a really good offering from Schlenkerla, once again!  The alcohol content is treacherous, you dont feel its 8% abv at all!

The flavor is multifaceted and comes in waves, the malt is up first and it is melanoidin-rich, followed by a nice hop bitterness and a touch of floral and somewhat earthy hops flavor and then a bit of smoke on the end, strong at first but diminishing with each sip.

3076,"2012-08-25",3.4,"4 oz. poured into a snifter at Churchkey. From notes.

A: Pours a dark tawny color with low clarity. The head is a one finger offwhite color with a thin ring sticking to the sides of the glass.

S: Smoke. And lots of it. Really, you have to expect that coming into something thats from Bamberg. But other than the smoky notes, theres an underlying oak quality to it - and overwhelming plasticky phenols. Quite good, apart from the strong phenolic aroma.

T: I half-expected this to be one massive smoke orgy. I didnt expect it to be so impressively balanced behind a caramel malt backbone, oaky tannins, and the damn phenol notes. The finish is more smoky than the beginning, but never overdone. Each subsequent sip helps to balance the firepit-esque smoke with the maltiness increasingly. Would be great if not for the plasticky flavors.

M: The texture is pseudo-creamy with a dry, tannic finish. Lower carbonation and decent drinkability.

O: Wasnt sure what to think at first, but I started to enjoy this more as I got near the end of my little sample, suggesting this is something that needs to be savored in larger quantities. An acquired taste to be sure.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Taste is pretty gentle and restrained for an 8% smoked doppelbock. Starts with the big sweet bread malt, rich and grainy--then transitions into a smoked jerky meatiness. Cherry cordial sweetness peeks through the smoke as it gets through the finish, ending with a sweet smokiness, real dry. Warms the belly. Medium to thin bodied, with a slickness and a bit of biting carbonation. I dont like overly sweet smoked beers, and I was worried this was going to go that route.

The extra lagering time comes off in a super smooth draw and light floral and berry undertones. Very easy to drink and the uniqueness of the smoked malt gets easier to palate as it goes down.

3076,"2012-08-02",3.6,"Sampled on tap
The beer arrives with a hazed, amber color and is topped by a wispy, tan tinged head. This has a full on meaty, smoke character that is apparent from a distance. There is a phenolic character to the smoke here, it is definitely more spicy than the standard Beechwood Rauch malt. Touches of woody hints at barrels (am I just imagining this). There is a fruity, rich malt character in the aroma that is just barely noticeable, but really this is all about the oak smoke.

The beer tastes sweet, though there is not a lot of this, there is lots of smoke though and the middle has a richness to it, but this is not overly heavy in texture. There is a more smokiness in the finish, as well as a touch of drying, woodiness. The rich malt really showcases the richness of the smoke character. You can sense the strength of this beer, but the alcohol is not overly noticeable. This is quite smooth, it has a heft to the body, but it is not too heavy; rich, but not cloying, and it finishes quite clean.

The oak smoke is definitely dominant here, this is great if you are into that (and I am). Interestingly, the oak smoke is definitely a bit rougher than the standard beechwood character, and it is quite distinct.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Palate: smoky, sweet, melted caramel, and nutty toffee in the back. Caramel brittle. Starts out sticky then finishes dry which induces thirst for more, thirst I am happy to oblige. Caramel coated applewood smoked bacon brittle delights. Orange oils. Charred oak in my breath. Honeycomb.

Tasted of wood and smoke as well as bacon but not as intense as the smell. a slight sweetness marries with the smoke perfectly and goes beautifully with food (smoked German Sausage in this lucky mans case!)

Body is a little undercarbonated.

3076,"2012-05-08",3.9,"Hoooo boy! This is a full rack of baby backs in a glass. Deep amber pour, with a fizzy, dissipating head. Serious smoke on the nose, with cured meats that make this really smell like a butcher shop. Burnt brown sugar and molasses lie behind, lending a note not too unlike a good scotch. Thick mouthfeel, with just enough carb to keep it from being sticky, and the style (smoked doppelbock) keeps it just a bit on the sweet side. Guess that makes this a Kansas City brew, not a Carolina brew. This beer makes me want to develop a drawl, then undercook and devour a giant steak.

3076,"2012-05-04",4.2,"Purchased at Armanettis in Chicago, IL; enjoyed on a cold early May Friday afternoon before seeing the Avengers.  I tried to get this when I was at Schlenkerla in Bamberg, but found it in a store near home thousands of miles from there.  Go figure.  Appearance is a very cloudy golden amber with a very small white head that rims around the glass.  Aroma is very burnt, almost more burnt than the marzen, more of a ham presence than bacon, kind of smells like a burned out campfire the following morning.  Taste is definitely potent, not as smoky as the marzen in flavor, its still pretty smooth.  Im convinced that ham fat is brewed into the beer.  Its not particularly malty but there is a presence of malt.  This is an excellent beer, one of the best doppelbocks Ive had for sure.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

3076,"2012-04-19",4.1,"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating.  Pours cloudy reddish orange color with a small 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers.  Some minimal lacing on the glass.  Aromas of big wood, smoked meat, charcoal, raisin, molasses, caramel, toffee, banana, apple, and herbal spiciness.  Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity.  The smoked aspect compliments the standard doppelbock aromas nicely.  Taste of caramel, molasses, raisin, smoke, wood, ham, toffee, biscuit, pepper, light citrus, and herbal spiciness.  Lingering notes of smoke, caramel, molasses, biscuit, and fruitiness on the finish for a good bit.  Great balance of flavors, with more standard doppelbock flavors going on; without the smokiness becoming too overwhelming.  Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel.  Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all.  Dangerously smooth to drink for 8%, but is definitely great to sip on.  Overall this is an excellent and highly enjoyable smoked doppelbock.  Great balance of flavors, without the smoke being over the top.  Great stuff.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Rich malt smell, lots of smoke, but a ""clean"" smelling smoke with a crispness to it.

The smoke is first in the taste, followed by the traditional doppelbock maltiness, then the smoke overpowers the malt again. It is really a smoke show here. Fairly sweet throughout too.

3076,"2012-03-31",2.6,"Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy, light brown, fully diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, toasted bread), lightly hoppy (apricot), with notes of smoke (ham, salmon, ash), band-aid, alcohol, fish sauce, cake icing. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. This is my second experience with the bottles that just showed up in CO, and I did this review with glasses of Maerzen and Urbock (also new batches that just arrived) side by side for comparison.  The Eiche has the most meaty smoke character, and its even fishy, which is both neat and icky...under the smoke, not much, just some caramel and bread really, some band-aidy plastic and maybe some apricotty hops which are pleasant on their own but dont mesh very well with the meaty smoke.  Some weird candy-cake smell comes out at times too, which also clashes.  So, some good aspects, but really jumbled and messy.  The Maerzen is ridiculously ashy this time, like a cigarette ashtray...unpleasant even, almost like a carpet fire, some yucky phenols perhaps (plastic/rubber).  Its usually not like that, but its the worst aroma of the three.  As is usually the case in bottle form, the Urbock wins.  Ive had better batches, but its got the usual nice woody and lightly meaty smoke (turning ashy the less liquid that remains in the glass), rich bready malt, some dark dried fruit (dates), and nice herbal hops.  Both the Maerzen and Urbock offered solid lasting heads (Urbock being the largest and creamiest), whereas the Eiche head disappears completely almost immediately.  The Eiche is also the lightest in color by quite a margin (Urbock being slightly darker than the Maerzen), although that doesnt affect the score, just an observation.  In the mouth, the Eiche is the biggest loser...overly sweet and quite fizzy, absolutely no fun to drink.  Gotta say Im surprised and disappointed in the Eiche...expected way, way, way better. But even the mighty Urbock isnt quite up to par this time, so it was probably just an off time at the brewery in general (and hopefully temporary, gulp!).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3076,"2012-03-26",3.6,"Clear rufous. Small eggshell head soon dies after decanting. Simple but fairly pleasant aromas of wintergreen, smoked grass clippings, petroleum jelly, prosciutto and light manure. Takes a vigorous swirl to coax the mineral and characterful lager yeast. Some muted fruity esters, as well. Curiously scant carbonation. Sturdy residuals are countered by that signature Heller-Trum cleanness which gives way to oily prosciutto and petroleum-jelly-tinged smoke. Firm base of woodiness is tastefully incorporated, as its clean to the point of exuding with a ghostlike presence yet manages to deepen some the ""greasier"" rauch character. Secondary grains barely exude with a dry and cookielike twinge, yet are simultaneously bouncy with vague notions of straw. Delightfully luscious and hearty bock character gracefully buoys the wood-laden smoke. After a few sips, the drinkability suffers as things teeter on the brink of medicinal due to the alcohol combining with the unfermented sugars. Little in the way of mineralic snap to be found, though the yeast compensates nicely to add lift as well as character. Gentle ashy scratchiness provides a welcome contrast to the slippery esters. Closes with a fleeting glimpse of biscuity Munich malt and fruity slickness, with a floral and vaguely peppery hop zing along with sweeter dabs of red licorice and brown sugar. As one can expect from this brewery, this is exceptionally clean and devoid of flaw. But with appropriate levels of carbonation along with a better showing of some dusty dextrins, this likely would be downright divine. Otherwise, as is, this is just a tad sweet/sugary.  Pretty nice, though.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Eventually, after a few mouthfuls this character dulls allowing the bitterness of the hops comes through, but not to any great extent. Ultimately you are left with a stodgy mouth feel of smoke that screams sausage!

The smoked Bamberg malts were prominent, and gave this beer a smoky, sweet aroma evocative of pork ribs.  The taste continue the theme of the smell, with a real smoke laden flavor backed by good deal of sweetness.  The hops were there in the finish, but only provided a restrained drying note, instead of an overt bitterness.  The sticky and smooth feel on the palette and a drawn out smoky finish that ended each sip were both very classy.  The smoked malts seem to do very well in a Dopplebock style.

3076,"2011-12-23",3.7,"1 PINT 0.9 Fl OZ bottle from Finger Lakes Beverage, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. 
App.:  Clear bright copper with a fair tan head.
  
Aroma:  That oh-so-typical Bamberger smoke  very meaty, sorta medicinal and metallic, my nose cant quite differentiate the oak vs beech  rich, fruity, sticky malts beneath the smoky vale, esters, restrained minty, cola-like herbals, this style stands up well to the smoke.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, relaxed effervescence.
  
Flav.:  The smoke is nicely integrated into rich, fruity, brown sugar, sticky malts, so much sweet malt, still some esters and faint minty herbals, quite interesting; fairly sweet with some bitterness and a long, somewhat smoky, rich malt finish.

The flavour is everything I expected from the nose. Thin bodied and not as severely smokey as the original rauch. Slick in mouthfeel, almost oily and gently carbonated. Earthy notes as well as smoked oak wood, cough drops and soy sauce impressions in the finish. Odd and not pleasant. I do love me some smoked beers, but this one just isnt doing it for me.

The smoke taste in this beer is not as meaty, bacon-like as their marzen nor was the beer as complex.

As a smoked beer fan, the aroma is heavenly.  Just a big smoky campfire in a glass.  Summer sausage, sweet caramel malts and a hint of earthy herbal malts.

The taste is more of the same with some bitter hops up front and a smoky presence thats a little spicier than the aroma.  The finish comes back to where the aroma started with a mixture of sweet caramel malts and heavily smoked oak and smoked meats.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation and a bit beefier than some of the other beers Ive had from Schlenkerla.

I love smoked beers and Schlenkerla does them better than anyone on the planet.  This particular beer is one of the top smoked beers Ive ever had.

3076,"2011-08-25",3.5,"Bottle in Yokohama, brought over from London.
I get a fair bit of oak and alcohol in the aroma.
Pours a clear light hazel colour. off white cream head fades fast.
Taste wise, I get a slightly cloying sweetness, medium bitterness,  high alcohols and oak are certainly evident. The smoked malt taste quite peaty alos in its strength, bordering on harshness. Very sweet (it Is a dopplebock, after all).  Sappy sweet  - tannins? Bitter finish with smoky oaky malt sweetness. Smoky oaky - I like that.
Soft carbonation, full body, thinnish syrupy mouthfeel.
That oak just seems like oak mixed with sap/syrup and sugar. Weird. I suppose that is what they went for, being a doppelbock (you may tell its not my fav style). Would like this one drier on the tongue, personally.
Not enjoying it as much as Id hoped. I guess beech smoked beers are more my thing. I thought I would go for this one.  Im not sure if the oak is overdone. I think the beer is a tad sweet, even for a doppelbock. Needs a fuller body to back up the sweetness or bump her up to 45IBU.
Improves as shewarms but the oak flavour increases also.","JAPAN","chuwy"

Taste: smooth, sweet and smoky, with evidence of toasty brown bread, some light brown sugar, with hints of cherry and (again) a hint of citrus.   Finish: mellow, lingering smokiness, with a bit of sweetness and restrained bitterness from the Hallertau hops.   Notes: The smoky character of this beer is much more restrained and delicate than in their other variants, but it definitely works.  The overall character of the beer is also lighter than what youd expect in a normal doppelbock as well.  It was really good.

This is unlike any doppelbock Ive had. So if you think youll be getting something like Celebrator or Salvator, youre not. It is firmly a Rauchbier.

A bit too sweet imho to match the excellence and drinkability of the Marzen or even the Urbock.  Very clean and crisp.  No alcohol presence whatsoever.

3076,"2011-04-21",2.9,"Bottle picked up in Chicago and served in a Mikasa pilsner glass.

THe pour brings a copper-hued brew with a very strange white head. It started out quite frothy with large bubbles, and then comes a reverse head. The two eventually meet and form a nice, dense white head with good retention. A bit of lacing on the glass and a thin collar throughout. This was the highlight of the beer for me. The nose is overwhelmingly smokey with a bit of a meat character and not much playing behind it.

The taste is similar in terms of what the smoke does. Here I can get a bit of the smoked oak, though I cant say it really adds a positive dimension. The underlying doppelbock is completely gone and I dont get anything that would indicate this was the base. The taste brings a bit too much tannin and is overwhelmingly smokey. I suppose its not that the level of smoke is bad, its just that theres really nothing else there. A bit of an astringent, bitter finish. Really not a fan of this though I could see how one could enjoy it. My least favorite Schlenkerla beer to date.

A - Nice crisp bronze color with a medium sized, thickish, fluffy, foamy, white head. Decent retention leaving a thin foamy lace.

S - Really nice aroma with the obvious smoked meat aroma. The oak provides a nice level to the aroma. There is a nice caramel/sweet malt aroma that in other beers can be overpowered by the smoked aroma. A very subtle raisin like aroma as well.

T - Like the nose, there is a lot of smoked meat flavor, but not much of a bonfire smokiness. Oak flavor is definitely present, though not dominating. Caramel malt and a subtle dark fruit flavor as well as a very faint hoppy bitterness show up. Pretty complex.

It pours a different color than most doppelbocks, it is a heller doppelbock It it a beaut though. t is a clear reddish orange with a foamy, but creamy white head that sticks for a nice while and recedes to some nice lacing.

It smells very smokey with campfire, smoked bacon, and smoked oak. There is a subtle kiss of noble hops hiding in the background.

The taste isnt as smoky as the smell but it is loaded with smoke overtones. This one legitimately has a slight taste of bacon with some syrup. The smokiness is in check, although it lingers with a bit of campfire in the finish. The malts are big and sweet, more so then some of the other Shlenkerla beers and it provides a nice balance to the smokiness.

The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, it makes this one a mouthful, but a pleasant one.

The helles is the only thing better from this great brewery.

That smoked sausage aroma is just so attractive it makes me tingle in my perineum.  But it isn?t stupidly strong, it has perfect balance on the aroma.  A little sweet in the mouth from the ABV.  But the balance in the mouth is just right.  Yes it?s a big tasting beer, but it never runs away with itself.  It has some sting on the end from hops and carbonation that balances the smoke and the ABV and the toffee.  There is a bit of reminder on the flavour of something you get in a dentist, but you soon ignore that.  Incredible really. Re rate on tap at Schlenkerla Bamberg.

The aroma isnt as strong as that on the other beers from this brewery that I have tried. Dry, chalky smell. Roasted green grape and sausage scents. The smell isnt as overwhelmingly awesome as I had hoped, but it certainly is quite good. Pours a gold to light amber color. Surprisingly light in color. Small amount of slow-rising bubbles. Small amount of short-lasting beige head. Smoke hits the palate right away. Fruity, juicy base that reminds of that of an English ale, surprisingly. Chalky, dry smokiness. The taste is closer to what I was hoping for than was the aroma. Meaty and lemon juice flavors. Charred oak-type taste reminiscent of that present in bourbon and rye whiskey. Long, dry, smoky aftertaste. Also a tongue-numbing chalkiness late in the aftertaste. Full body. Could stand to be a bit livelier. Easy to drink.

3076,"2011-01-23",3.6,"A: The beer pours amber in color with a soapy white head to go with it.

S: Definitely quite a bit of smoke, though not quite as campfire heavy as their other beers. Theres a definite oak smell to this (apparently the use of oak is one of the main things that sets this beer apart from their others) it, and just very woody overall. A slight meaty character, which I tend to pick up in smoked beers.

T: I can actually taste a decent amount of sweetness from the beer, which has a doppelbock recipe. There is still a lot of smoke and a hint of saltiness to it. There is a touch of fruit underneath, maybe apples. Perhaps its the saltiness, but I actually do get some bacon here.

It is a fairly standard coppery bock color w/ a small white head. The nose is the furthest thing from standard, however. Its thick w/ musty smoked notes. You can really tell the difference between this and their standard offerings. This feels a bit more nuanced, perhaps a bit floral. This brings to mind aromas of the forest in autumn around a camp fire. The texture is creamy and the touch of alcohol is warm and comforting.

Pours a golden orangeish with a small creamy white head.  Nose is huge sharp smokiness, wood, oak, malt, sweetness and maybe a tiny hint of alcohol.  Taste is slight malt sweetness upfront which immediately gives way to a sharp long-lasting smokiness with oaky, woody undertones and very subtle earthy hop bitterness at the very end.   Aftertaste lasts forever, mouthfeel borders on thick and syrupy, medium carbonation.  Incredibly flavorful, the fullness of the mouthfeel is the only clue of the 8% ABV.  Surprisingly enough, the smoke and oak blend together perfectly and there is no heat, no astringency, no off flavors at all, cant believe these flavors meld together this well in such a fresh beer.

3076,"2011-01-08",4.5,"500 ml with best before date June 2011 into Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche glass. Pours amber to deep coppery body with reddish hue and good clarity, topped by medium beige dense head with good retention, that clings to the walls.
Aroma is a pleasant balance between malty sweetness and non-harsh, smooth wood &, bacon-like smokiness obtained by oak-wood kilned malt.The smoky curtain is delicate enough to transmit the Doppelbock characteristics of the base beer underneath: rich malty malty sweetness with significant melanoidins and touch of plum and grape-like fruitiness.
The flavor is campfire and bacon-like smokiness which interplays with malty sweetness. The malts show melanoidin qualities accompanied by notes of dark chocolate. Towards the finish emerges peppery spiciness (probably originating from the Hallertau hops used) with moderate hoppy bitterness. No inappropriate harsh, burnt or charred flavors. The finish is semisweet although the smoke reduces the Doppelbock sweetness to some degree by adding some dryness. Medium to full boded with soft carbonation and unbelievable drinkability for a beer of this type, partially thanks to smooth and complex yet not overpowering smoky character.

In short: A fantastic smoked Doppelbock with perfect balance between the smoke and base beer, reflecting the character of both.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

All sorts of bready and crackery notes toward the end, along with that ever-present smoke (but different smoke from what Im used to from Schlenkerla, getting a little toward fish).  Smooth, rich obese body with a touch of alcohol wallop for good measure.  Just layers of malt for the tongue to sift through.  Touch of hoppy spice from the bright and lively additions, and another spicy note that suggests a dash of rye.  Even smaller touch of lagery citrus and crispness.

The smoking woody oak tree notes really take over, but also some caramel and grain malts with decent dose of earth as well. On the pour, a thin layer of white bubbling cream head, little retention, and a light auburn, bright, clear, and lightly carbonated appearance. The body is nicely creamy and medium bodied. I was expecting it to be a bit more chewy, but actually turned out to be nicely drinkable. Light sweet fruits start in the beginning, with strong smoked wood and earth taking it through the end. Well balanced as  a result and pleasantly bitter. Other notes of toffee, cookies, medium grain malts and light burned grass. I think the smoked notes work quite well with the doppelbock style.

Clear tones of campfire smoke alongside more subtle meaty/sausage/fish-like notes. A light sweetness from the malt is notable. Herbal, light grassy hops way in the background. Elegant and Lager clean nose. Whisper of honey, wet asphalt, wet forest, doughy white bread, wood shop and dried fruits. Complex nose (for a smoked beer). The flavour is light to medium sweet and light to medium bitter. Tones of smoke, herbal/grassy hops, dried fruits and bread. The flavour is bit more one-dimensional if you compare it to the aroma. The mouthfeel is clean, soft and smooth with a light sticky touch. Light to medium carbonated. Smoke lingers. Medium to full bodied.

Nose is a bit more grainy and leafy than other Schlenkerla, still nice smoke but not as thick or immediate. The smoke flavor also lays off a bit at first, way more caramel and earth at front palate, then a wave of malt, leaf, bubblegum mid-palate, then finally some lasting hints of lingering citrus, and alcohol in the finish, leading to medicinal notes. Moderate-full body, sweeter than most Schlenkerla leading to more complexity from the less amped, more balanced smoke, one that I enjoy less but still find fantastic. The finish is long-lasting smoke. Damn good, not my favorite, but fantastically enjoyable while remaining subtle.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Well, in fact its one of the more intense and complex smoky aromas Ive come across in a while.  More of a brine and woodsy smoke with this beer, and with a great hoppy interplay that adds some herbs and late hay.  There is less of the (typical) Schlenkerla smoked meat (hate that analogy) and yet its just as smoked.  Gorgeous.  Medium bodied with soft eff and a lingering bitterness that begins mid-palate and sticks around with a grassy, herbal, mildly woody note.  Late leather and some alcohol, quite warming, savory, damn.

3076,"2010-12-23",4.2,"Pours orange with a medium well retained head and some bit of lace. The aroma is very woody and smoky but this is not without a nice dose of fruitiness and some mineral character. The smoke in the aroma  is a very sweet smoke I kept thinking of Christmas hams and bacon. The flavor has a nice spicy on smoky character right up front and the fruity almost sweet malt again gives this a cured bacon character. 
the beer has a nice dose of bitterness not from any distinct hop likely because of the dominant character of the smoke and malt, er um.. the smoked malt... whatever. Despite the smoke the beer retains the character of a dopplebock almost perfectly with a nice semisweet malt, some spiciness, and a nice creamy texture with just a tinge of warmth from the alcohol. This retains the style on the label far better than say the Marzen or Weizen do, not that that makes those bad beers... I guess it just makes this one all the more remarkable. The beer is nicely full on the palate and the carbonation is low but just right to perfectly present this beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

3076,"2010-12-17",4.2,"Bottle, from Schlenkerla-shop.de. A two-finger thick head sits patiently on top of the steadily sparkling deep amber body. Nice layers are left as the creamy, off-white head slides down the glass as Im enjoying the beer. Quite subtle on the nose, at least compared to the Urbock or Märzen. Smoke, damp forest, caramel notes, hints of prunes, figs and dates, and some caramel. A faint alcohol touch and some grains and grassy hops too. The smoke parts reminds me of both smoked meat, smoked and then roasted sausages and a bit like smoked fish. Its full-bodied and creamy on the palate, with a slight alcohol burn down the throat. A bit too smooth actually. Theres a whole bunch of complexity in the flavor as well. Some bitterness, but not much. Far from overly sweet, but sure on the sweet side, with caramel. Else theres wood notes, smoke, alcohol hints, dried fruits, cured meat and some grassy hop hints. The end stays for a long time, very long. Wow, this was a real treat! Its dangerously easy drinking, at least when cold, a bit more demanding when it heats up a bit. Its really tasteful, and it has the looks of a super model. Due to Norwegian tax rules it was pretty expensive getting a crate of these, but it was certainly worth each damn penny. Or øre as the Norwegian equivalent is.

3076,"2010-12-06",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2013 Bottle from 5 points bottle shop. Had my first bottle a couple weeks back at a better temperature and it was everything I would expect from Schlenkerla. This particular glass Ive poured myself is a little too cold. It seems sweeter with more vegetal esters and less smokiness, not at all the amazing brew I indulged in last time. I am noticing how low the carbonation is in this. No head remains. As the brew comes up in temp, that lovely campfire, barbecue-like smoke gains strength. This was supposed to be a departure from the marzen or urbock, but its not much of one. I certainly cant complain. The smoke is similar to beechsmoke, still meaty and lingering. This strongly reminds me of their urbock, maybe just slightly fruitier. Absolutely wonderful smoked offering when served closer to cellar temperature.

3076,"2010-11-27",4.8,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2010 From the wood @ Schlenkerla! where it is served in an unmarked goblet, like a wide tulip, and really comes across as a Belgian Christmas beer in character.

3076,"2010-04-06",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2017 Most recent glass, at the Schlenkerla Ausschank, in January 2017:

Well, this recipe has changed, it seems! Much darker visually, with residual sugars more on the caramel and berry ham side of things than the previous honey. But, of course, the intense smokiness is what dominates, and thats why you want to drink this wintry brew.

First glass, back in 2012:

My Bottom Line:
Elegant smoke effortlessly rises from maple-laced honeyed malts , creating a seamless, polished Heller Rauchbock (dont know what else to call it, to be frank) that is graced by touch of herbal hop aftertaste.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam covers the translucent golden amber.
-The mouthfeel on this one (on tap) is absolutely perfect. Round enough to let you know its a potent brew, yet luxuriously smooth. The bottle is a tad softer as carbonation is not as prickly.
-Candied, phenolic allusions appear from time to time.
-Alcohol is well concealed by the smoked malts, making an appearance in the finish only.
-That aroma is something else. The oak smoke personality, with some herbal hops, almost emulates peat smoke at times.

3076,"2010-01-14",4.2,"Sampled on draft at the Bookstore Speakeasy in Bethlehem, PA.

Pours a clear dark coppery amber color with golden orange/amber edges when held to a light source and a two finger frothy white head with excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap and ring that leaves sporadic spots of soapy lacing behind.

Excellent roasted smokey aroma with hints of campfire, butane, barbecue, bacon ash, earthy burnt wood subtle hops, smoked malt and a subtle nut presence. I took in the aroma of this beer for a while before sampling. While it is still pretty intensely smokey, I found the aroma of Eiche to be less extreme than the other Aecht Schlenkerla beers.

Surprisingly creamy medium body with a softer smoke presence than I expected. There is still a good amount of burnt smokey malt flavor but the use of oak instead of beechwood results in a much smoother, less extreme smoke flavor. Still, there is plenty of smoked malt, barbecued bacon, butane and burnt wood in this incredibly complex beer. In addition, there is a lactic creaminess and a noticeable earthy wood presence, likely from the oak. Also, there is a slick, buttery white wine taste that was a complete shock to me. It added another level of complexity to this incredible beer. The only other beer Ive tasted this flavor in is Allagash Vagabond and this element of Eiche reminds me of that beer. Im also picking up a bit of earthy roasted nuttiness toward the end of the finish. Lingering dry and earthy smoked flavor in the finish. Highly recommended","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
3076,"2010-01-14",4.0,"Draft at the Bavarian Lodge (Lisle, IL). Pours a nice orange amber, darker and dulled, a decent haze with a large tannish beige head, laces pretty well and cakes pretty big. Aromas are a nice bounty of campfire meats, bacon and sausage, mixed with a touch of smokey wood, caramel malts beneath with a faint spice, vanilla, as the brew takes on a smoke dominant position. Initial is a medium body, crisp smokey ash and copious smokehouse meats, bacon and ham, a salty bit, mixing with a faint vanilla, caramel and cereal beneath, smooth, with some light bitterness in the finish. The alcohol becomes discernible as it warms a bit, oak is lively but covered a bit by the smoked element, still lovely on the palate, the smoke doesnt get too out of control and this ends up to be quite drinkable (but then again, I really am digging smoked beers). Finish is lasting, smokey and a light malty sweetness beneath with light bitterness on the backend to temper. Big but delicate, smoke forward but more than that.Very nice.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3076,"2010-01-13",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2010 Tap.  Didnt notice this was my 200th rate until after I entered it, but its a pretty good choice for it.  Poured a coppery amber with a smallish white head.  Aroma is dominated by the rich, somewhat meaty smokiness.  The smoke flavor hit me hard at first, but after a couple sips it stopped dominating, and I appreciated the beer as a whole more.  Has a strong, somewhat sweet malty body and a spicy, bitter hop presence.  The alcohol is not very noticable at all.  I didnt know the ABV when I drank this, and was estimating it to be something like 5%.  I could feel the smoke on my breath for a good long while after having this.  This was the first beer Ive tried with this level of smoke, and it was a pretty awesome experience.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"

3076,"2010-01-13",3.7,"Tap at Beachwood.  Was really excited to see this.  Nose is that classic porkloin zest we all know and love.  Color is a reasonable garnet.  Flavor was smaller than I expected.  Thought this would be more robust than the Urbock for some reason.  The oak happens at the start of the flavor, rather than the finish which was unusual to me.  Ultimately this helps avoid the crazy plunge from tangy roast malt to char that you find in the regular lineup of Schlenkerla.  Finish is more round and sweet than I remember the Urbock being - or than I prefer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
3076,"2010-01-12",4.1,"What can I say about Schlenkerla brews, they all rock and I love the smoke.  The brew is all smoke, hence I love it.  The beer is very well attenuated, thus nicely drying.  Particularly, the smoke is dry here, very different from the sweatier beechwood smoke in their other brews.  Love the beer, could keep putting down glass after glass. The color is a dark golden to light amber. I have no idea where that alcohol is coming from.

3076,"2010-01-09",3.2,"Tap. Aroma of smoked bacon, very salty, and freshly smoking firewood, very much straight oaky.

3076,"2010-01-08",4.0,"Draught at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL.  Pours a clear amber with a creamy off-white head.  Has that trademark campfire bacon aroma.  The oak seems more prevalent in the flavor than the aroma where a distinct oak wood character comes through along with distinct bitter hops and a full smoky body.  Body is full with a nice lingering bitterness with some floral notes.  Finishes with a dry bitterness.  Delicious.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
3076,"2010-01-04",3.6,"Draft at Redlight Redlight.  The pour yields a clear, coppery, golden-amber hued body.  A smooth, foamy, off-white head settles in to a steady, thin blanket, leaving patchwork lacing on the glass.  The nose is based is doughy, sweet, bready malt, with notes of caramel, light floral hops, and a solid dose of woody, slightly salty smoke.  To be honest, I cant really decipher the oak from the standard beechwood.  Flavors mirror the nose, again sweet and doughy, with notes of caramel and dried fruit on the back end.  Smoke is persistent, but not overpowering, again lending a hint of saltiness and earthen char.  Big bodied, with balanced carbonation, the palate sports a round, slightly drying finish.  Very good stuff, but the additional malt and alcohol dont necessarily lend themselves to this style.  I prefer the more sessionable offerings from the folks at Schlenkerla.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Medium bodied, lighter carbonation than I was expecting, silky and smooth.  Smooth smoked meats and caramel and toffee.  Finishes up with more elegant smoke infusing everything.  Classic Schlenkerla smoke that makes every nasal exhalation for the next half hour smoke infused.  Really tasty, and any indication of the abv on this is well hidden.  How do they hide it?  Smoke and mirrors possibly.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Nose is nice smoke over a toffee and caramel creamy malt body. Smoke is more subdued in the flavor, hitting light up front followed by the strong malt body, a sweet vanilla tinged toffee middle. Complex aftertaste with creamy malt and smoke returning, mild earthiness, a touch of alcohol and slight drying astringency. Very light in the mouth, creamy with a nice dryness despite the sweet malty body. Quite nice!","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"

the wonderful smokiness in the aroma and flavor is sweeter than the beechwood smoked schlenkerla beers (not sure if that is from the oak, or more malt, or less hops, or a combination).  IMO, its not as hop-bitter as the marzen, or as malty as the urbock, and is a bit lighter on the palate than any of the others.","Sanford, Florida, USA","SanfordBrewer"

3076,"2009-12-28",3.0,"Sampled on tap at Churchkey in Washington DC.  I have to preface my rating by saying I HATE rauchbiers.  They really arent my cup of tea.  This one comes a transparent, caramel orange with a white head.  When cold, the aroma was a little like smoked lox, but once it warmed up a sensational smoky oak aroma popped out.  Unfortunately, like many smoked beers, cold smoke was all I smelled.  The flavor also had a distinct peaty, smokiness but the oak really comes through well.  Its all about the oak.  Close your eyes and it tastes like youre eating a smoked gouda.  While one dimensional, the flavors are definitely unique, even for the style.  Finish was medium bodied with a hint of lingering sweetness.  Easily the best smoked beer Ive ever had, one Id actually order again.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

Flavor is definitely a toned down rauchbier with the oak taking quite a bit of edge off the traditional beechwood, smokey ham and bacon up front followed by bready malts and noble hop flavor and bitterness, finishes malty and smokey. Full body, modest carbonation, thick texture. A unique smoked beer, perhaps a bit less powerful and easier to use as a gateway rauch, good balance and malt profile.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

Smoked salmon.  Lotsa oak and smoke.  Once my tastebuds became accustomed to the smoke the taste settled down a bit.  Seriously overwhelming for the first few drinks.  6oz was plenty on this one.

Creamy firm body. The smoke is there, but theres an oily, heavy tannin presence that coats the tongue. The oak doesnt give as clean of a smokiness as the beechwood. Its more hammy and less firewood like. Theres lots of peppery hallertau hops on the back. Not as smoke, or robustly malt forward as the originals.

Toffee flavor, toast, some earth and herbalness, light cleanser attributed t the tannins in the oak smokiness, more clean smoke- mineral in the end, overall very clean and easy drinking, especially for all the smoke and the 8%.
