3128,"2017-05-09",4.0,"Sample from a 0.75l bottle @ Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2016. The legend. This one pours a mild blurry golden colored body with a small quickly sidesticking white head in the top. Nice, but not too extreme nose. A bit surprised by that actually. Still, its soft wood sour with green currants and a little quite suiting white vine. Theres also this nice sweetness in the blend - like a peachy sweetness. Nice, but as mentioned a little milder than I thought. Oh, its sour and sharp in the taste! Really stingy and wild. Makes up for the arome. Almost like sour heather with honey and a rush of lemon juices. White currant sour, a little gooseberry freshness in the finish. Really fruity and superb refreshing.

3128,"2015-05-02",4.5,"Huge thanks to Kevin for bringing this one to Imminent Liquidation V. Pours murky orange-ish yellow with a one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace on the sides of the glass.


Smell is amazing. Loads of apricots, woody oak, musty basement and barnyard funkiness, some other nondescript tropical fruit, earthen mineral and some doughy malt. Taste is just as good with tons of fresh fruit up front quickly being joined by the funkiness and finally the other supporting flavors. Smooth, fruity/sour feel from start to finish. Definitely a bit bigger feel than the regular West Ashley but it is still very easy drinking. 


Overall this is one of the best fruited saison/sours I have ever had. I love West Ashley but this takes it to a whole other level. I cant thank Kevin enough for opening this one for us all to try, cheers buddy!","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
3128,"2015-04-28",3.9,"Bottle (750 ml). From Jake/Chris, thanks!

Appearance: Hazy golden with a small white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: A burst of apricots and oak, which is really interesting, but not much to support it. Theres some brettanomyces as well as some oak spiciness and subdued winey notes. 

Taste: Taste is quite acidic with a lot of jammy apricots and a ton of oak. Theres also some oak spiciness, winey notes, brettanomyces and light herbal presence.

Palate: Medium body. Medium carbonation. Oaky mouthfeel. Moderately dry finish. Lingering apricots aftertaste. 

Overall: Its a very good beer, but it lacks of finesse. Its definitely fruitier and more oaky than West Ashley, but that doesnt make it much better. Really nice fruitiness and interesting oak features, but lack a bit of balance. A bit disappointing considering its often considered Sante Adairius most wanted beers, but they make other beers much better than this one. Still tasty though. It was delicous mixed with Heady Topper (1 part of Westly for 3 parts of Heady).","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3128,"2015-04-28",4.0,"bottle shared by tom10101, thanks bro! pours hazy light golden with a small creamy reviving white head leaving nice lacing. fruity apricots  not an explosion; other pale orchard fruitiness, zesty oranges, spices, light acidity - nice and complex microflora, gently oaked, pepper and herbs. light carbonation, light body  oily; dry, tart and fruity-spicy finish. an upgrade from west ashley but not necessarily spectacular either.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
3128,"2015-04-27",3.6,"Thanks to Tommy for sharing this whale with us. Pours a really hazy golden with no head and no lacing. Nose is of fruits and pretty intense acetic acid. Taste is of fruits (apricots) and massively acidic and puckering. Body is medium, carbonation light to moderate. Overall it was good but unrefined. A little less enjoyable than West Ashley, even. I wouldnt ask for it again but Im
pleased that we got to try it.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3128,"2015-04-26",4.0,"Bottle. Hazy gold pour with thin white head. Aroma of apricot, nice and fruity, funky Saison, really nice winey bretty aroma. Taste is doughy, tons of tart apricot, apricot jam, lemony notes. Palate is med-light bodied nice carbonation. Really nice.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
3128,"2015-04-23",4.5,"Rating #4400. Bottle. Golden hazy pour with tan head. Super sweet peach aromas. Peach, tart, funk and sour tones; super juicy and sweet.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3128,"2015-03-28",4.8,"Huge thanks to yourefragile for the share. Served alongside West Ashley. Pale yellow body with a thin, broken head. Lovely aroma. Fruit and funk. Stone fruit, melon, tropical notes, oranges, apricots. Oh my...what a flavor. West Ashley was phenomenal and this somehow takes it up another notch. White wine and oak character emerges, adding depth and complexity. A thicker, richer body with a glimpse of an acetic note in the finish. Lingering fruit and tannins. World class.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
3128,"2015-03-02",4.4,"Rating #2200! Poured into a Duvel tulip. Nice shimmering golden orange with a firm white head, good retention, slowly fading into a persistent filmy ring. Aroma is predictably very strong with the dried apricot, reminiscent of West Ashley but different -- somehow funkier (eggy and sharp) with a touch of medjool date sweetness. Flavor is quite juicy, dried apricots and white wine (some sips sauv blanc, some sips champagne), expiration-date greek yogurt, beautifully integrated oaky finish (not tannic or buttery), a lingering pang of acid, a bit acetic but restrained in that aspect, lactic and cheesy in general. Long, dry finish. Life is an apricot.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3128,"2015-01-27",4.3,"Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Sour apricot aromas. Big sour apricot notes dominate. Super sour but still damn tasty. Good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
3128,"2015-01-26",4.3,"Pours hazy golden yellow. Light smells of apricot. Rich apricot taste, light sourness, a little salty and damn good!","Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA","biggsbowler"
3128,"2015-01-26",4.2,"The beer is a bright, glowy gold. Yellowish orange. Nice foamy head. Lots of lacing. Big apricot aroma. Sweet and fruity. Really not a lot else gets through besides the fruit. Mild to medium tart taste. Lots more fruit flavor. Sort of a heavier feel. Just a ton of fruit. Great beer, but the higher abv doesnt really work for me. Still very tasty and interesting to try West Ashley amped up.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3128,"2015-01-06",4.5,"Cloudy orange color, small white head. Juicy apricots hit up front and linger throughout the sip. Quite tart but not abrasively sour. Tons of vibrant stone fruit. A tad hint of yeast. I think I liked this more than west Ashley, barely.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3128,"2015-01-01",3.8,"Draft. Amber beer with a cream head. Tart and apricot pie aroma. Acetic notes and sour flavor with light apricots. Medium bodied. Sour and acetic notes linger with apricot, light lemon, and light oak.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
3128,"2014-11-26",3.4,"Bomber. Gonna throw this one off the hype train before it leaves California. Kinda smells like burnt hair and perm solution in my grandmas beauty shop. Taste is fruit and a bit of sour with some harsh acidity. Had this in a tasting with 13 awesome sours and it was at the bottom of the list.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3128,"2014-11-10",4.7,"Bottle thanks to Chow, Russell, and Rainer. Pours a cloudy orange with medium frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is apricot flesh, oak, apricot pits. Thick mouth with strong apricot juice, lingering apricot flavor, so juicy, wow really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3128,"2014-11-10",4.3,"A few bottles, and on draft at Good Karma, such an honor! Aroma is explosive apricot flesh, pits, dried apricot, some lime, yogurt, lots of acid and an ever-so-slight- waxy/plastic phenol on the exhale. Musty funk and oak is present to keep the beer in balance from a juice bomb. The beer pours cloudy golden with some chunks and a big fluffy white head that sticks around for a bit. Taste up front is apricot pith, some white wine, harsh sourness, lots of citrus, lemon, lime, more waxy dried apricot. The body is thick, creamy with medium carbonation and sour finish. The after taste is citrus, peach and apricot skin funk and oak. Wowzers so many layers. The first bottle I opened was definitely the most fruit forward, while the sourness really came out on draft. The second bottle had a better balance of the two extremes and definitely more West Ashley like. Great beer to track the changes, I would think that fresh is best however.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3128,"2014-11-10",3.5,"At the Bistro Barrel Fest, this poured a hazy orange - melon hue with a thin cream colored head. The nose was tart and moderate apricot with some funk. The first and lasting impression is acidic and tartness. Not much of anything else, possibly because the acidic characteristic is just too overwhelming.","SF Bay Area, California, USA","AgentSteve"
3128,"2014-10-12",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2015 Bottle. Thanks Jake and Nick. Pours orange gold white head. Nose/taste of super fresh apricot, oak, wine and tart acid. Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
3128,"2014-10-12",4.2,"Aroma is very fruity with a lot of apricot character. Light acidity and citrus character. Light oak notes. Aroma is mostly dominated by apricot. 
Pours a cloudy orange with a medium sized, fairly thick white head that recedes quickly to the edges. Moderately high lacing and small legs. Some chunks at the bottom of the glass. 
Flavor is lightly acidic with some medium light oak notes and light tannins. Medium bitterness and slightly hard water. Lots of apricot character with some light citrus notes and a bit of peach and pear. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really nice, very apricot forward beer. Some light oak barrel character and acidity compliments the apricots. Not much base beer character.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3128,"2014-09-28",4.2,"3500TH TICK AND THIS IS A RARE TICK OMG HELL YES THIS IS GONNA BE AAAWWWWWEEEESSSSOOOOMMME I know from the bottle count and trade value. Hazy orange color with a white head and nice swirls. Excellent sour apricot aroma with funk and a touch of vinegar. The flavor is lactic and slightly acetic. Loads of sour apricot - great fruit flavor. Medium-bodied and bitingly sour with lively carbonation. Great beer!

3128,"2014-09-27",4.2,"Pour is a deep golden amber with tons of very tight white head that sits forever. Nose is very dusty up front, faint touch of cheese, nice fresh very ripe apricot. Taste is similar, bright peach and apricot, dusty brett balances and integrated gently, moderately sour, not acetic, gentle bitterness in the finish. Lighter body, fairly soft feel, assertive carb and fairly dry.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
3128,"2014-09-23",4.3,"Mmm apricots in the face! A - this pours a nice glowing apricot with 1 finger of white head and strong sticky lacing. S - strong pretty interesting nose. Dried apricots and apricot jam come on strong. Very musty and white winey. Strong barrel character with some vinegar, Sauvignon blanc grapes. Crackery malts and lemon juice. The nose is so powerful and almost a chemical tone. M - full thick body. Nice blend of maltiness and sour. Thinner end. Nice balance and full palate. T - now this is where Westly really shines. So! much! apricot! Those soft Dried apricots and sweet apricot preserves with a touch of lemon juice lead into that fantastic Sante yeast and house bugs. The palate is malty goodness, nice barrel character, buttery and citrusy white wine character. The end has a touch of dill pickle juice. Very very fruity. O - a fantastic showing from Sante. A nice take on west ashley.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3128,"2014-09-08",4.4,"Yay, first rating! Bottle shared among friends. Pours cloudy golden amber, lots of chunks. Small off-white head that dissipates leaving good lacing.
