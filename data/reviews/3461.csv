3461,"2017-04-25",3.6,"2016 bottle drunk 3/18/17.Pours a very dark, viscous-looking ebony with a dark tan head atop showing moderate to moderately-strong retention.The nose is a good mix of lightly-to-moderately fudgey malts with light ash/char and more even roast. Bourbon-like notes emerge adding minimal spice and some liquor-like character but the barrel is reserved to mostly the coconut-like toastiness with strong vanilla as well. Its not overly boozy; doesnt seem raw, though the liquor and the 12% inevitably lead to some alcohol fumes. Lightly fruity and with some dry, bready and biscuity notes on the finish.In the mouth its soft and malty with moderate sweetness. Id prefer it even more dry, but its not a fudgey, syrupy mess, at least. Lots of toasted oak character, perhaps a bit heavy on it, with prunes, chocolate and caramel and a low but engaging carbonation. Lightly spicy whiskey-like notes with some minor warming from the alcohol. Nice stuff, though theres nothing particularly outstanding to me here.  Seems the slight amount of age has helped.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3461,"2016-03-14",4.2,"Pours a thicker, motor oil black color with an immediately disappating small, dark brown head.

Very Bourbon forward on the nose, with a multi layered spiciness to it, which gets balanced by burned malts and bitter chocolate. The prominent barrel characteristics feature an apple sweetness, blending into cinnamon and flowery, caramel coated vanilla. 

Drinks truly smooth, while producing an oak covered barrel bite during the finish, with a subdued, fitting, lower carbonation, featuring the beers complex body in a perfect fashion. 

Tastes of soft whipped cream, warm oak, and a big load of milk chocolate, which slowly turns more and more into a bitter chocolate direction, backed up by dried tobacco and burned malts. Sweet toffee, fudge and mousse au chocolate provide a nice, balancing sweetness, getting amped up by the spicy, yet pleasantly integrated barrel. This creates a breathtaking, well accentuated complexity, with a chocolate coated Bourbon bite prevailing. Finishes with its initial smooth chocolate qualities, with some alcohol soaked apple peel and lots of cinnamon cutting through, among cream soothed glazed toffee. 

A truly extreme beer as for spicy, dry Bourbon gets challenged by utmost creamy, smooth chocolate, exhibiting an intriguing interplay with almost charred, lingering malts. This holds up to its well build taste diversity, uniting far reaching contrasts on the palate, mostly due to a soothing cream smoothness, calming the potent Bourbon bite, and the omnipresent malt bill perfectly well.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3461,"2015-09-24",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis house. Poured from a 22 oz bottle. This makes up for everything that was Even More Jesus. The pour is a thick, oily black with a dark brown cap of head and no lace as it falls to a film. The aroma is great. Its a little hot, but thats the only knock. Lots of chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and dark fruits. There is an obvious booze here, but the other components are just great. The flavor is big on a bourbon aspect to go with the chocolate, light roast, and solid vanilla. There is a nice sweetness on the back end that I wasnt expecting to see. Its almost like a dark fruit molasses. The mouth feel is thick and chewy with a soft carbonation that is just incredibly thick. The aftertaste is lingeringly roasty and boozy, with just enough sweetness to keep it from being off-putting.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3461,"2015-08-05",4.2,"22 oz. bottle shared by DrSilverworm - thanks again, Chris, for sharing this long-time want. Pours an inky, opaque midnight brown that is more of a cocoa shade around the edges and when it reaches the bottom. Small brown head that settles into a tiny ring that leaves some wisps of film and spots in the glass. Decadent, fudgy aroma, with raisins, vanilla, bourbon, cocoa, toasted brown sugar, and mellow roast. The flavor is smokier and roastier where the aroma was sweeter - deep roasted malts, charred oak, burnt sugar, vanilla, dark and milk chocolate, and a warming bourbon throughout it all. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a roasty, boozy, barely ashy mouthfeel with just a bit of balancing sweetness. Doesnt linger like expected, nor does it coat the palate for as long as initially expected. Excellent barrel-aged imperial stout.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3461,"2015-08-03",4.2,"22oz bottle, from Dutchs (we only got 6). Shared with Ratebeer friends. Pours impressively pitch black. Thin brown head, fades to a ring. Leaves some kinda loose bits of lace. Awesome big barrel and stout character, such big flavor. Dark chocolate, liqueur-soaked dark chocolate cake, batter, bit of brown sugar, nice mocha. Good complex barrel character (bourbon, maybe something else?). Awesome big barrel, but not harsh or too boozy. Definitely a touch of warmth, but its not unpleasant. Moderate-plus bitter, nice big sweet but not at all cloying. Bigger body. Nice chewy velvety texture. Light carbonation. Mild slick. Some dark fruit character. Delicious, big barrel aged stout. Fantastic. I poured maybe 175ml max and that was more than enough for me to fall in love and type all this. Sitll have a third of the glass to enjoy, and thats totally OK.

Loads of chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel, anise, allspice, tobacco, dark fruits-cherry/raisin, notes of sherry. Medium to heavy body, never chewy...but with the big bourbon/rye on the finish, I feel like more body would have provided a bit more balance here. Nice depth to the beer, no doubt.

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark brown head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Some slight lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, licorice, dark bread, spicy rye, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, tobacco, light smoke/char, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fantastic aromas with incredible complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, licorice, dark bread, spicy rye, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, tobacco, light smoke/char, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, licorice, dark bread, spicy rye, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, tobacco, light smoke/char, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of huge dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class barrel aged imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the huge ABV.  Very similar to Even More Jesus with some mellower deep roasted character and added rye and barrel complexity. An insanely delicious offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Fades quick to a skimpy collar. Aroma is huge in presence with strong woody & barrel laden notes right out of the gate. Spicy bourbon spiked dark chocolate fudge with sweet hints of vanilla, toasted graham cracker, burnt anise, & sweet cake batter. Wow. Tastes like liquid Devils Food cake laced with bourbon & oak chips. Crazy brown batter vibe with heavy-ass vanillin from the barrel. Charred brown sugar, bittersweet cocoa, & a mild touch of dark fruit in the back-end. I get a ""spicy"" note that almost reminds me of cinnamon coated graham crackers... Not as vibrant as youd get from something like Mexi Cake or Hunahpu, but I definitely get a mild cinnamon joint from this jam.

Very subtle barrel-character on the nose for me on this one. The taste is very roasted and has notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, roasted coffee, dry wood, weak tobacco, dark dried fruits and some sweeter caramel tip of thing as well. The barrel character is subtle here as well but is still giving the beer a nice edge of dryness and a wooden feel which kinda makes this a decadent SOB to sip on.

3461,"2014-08-30",4.3,"The beer is black and looks quite thick. Very small head, dark brown. Small ring of bubbles. The aroma is very big on chocolate with mild fruitiness and roast, and then, theres a strong, complex spirit barrel note. All sorts of stuff going in there. Big on vanilla. Some grape and spice. Tons of dark molasses. Caramel sweetness. Moderately acidic. Solid alcoholic kick in the taste but it works with the huge sweetness of the beer. This is liquid fudge with a spirit bonanza on top. More of the roast and coffee come out in the taste. Its definitely dessert in a glass, but the barrel flavor cleans things up pretty well in the finish with tannic oak and heat. Raisins, caramel, even more molasses. Cherries and grapes. Chocolate dominates but all of the other flavors play nicely. Very full mouthfeel. Its decadently silky and thick.

3461,"2014-08-16",4.5,"Bomber, thanks Paul, this stuff rocks. Midnight black pour. Thin yet creamy tan head. Bourbon, chocolate covered caramel turtles, smoke. Just the right balance between sweet, booze, and dark malt. As far as straight up bourbon stouts this might be in the top 3 behind bourbon county and bba dark lord.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3461,"2014-08-03",4.7,"Sometimes making a great beer better isnt always easy...barrel aging is a complicated process, and I have had many beers where something went wrong. DBJ however; does not have any of these issues. Excellent balance from start to finish. Chocolate, some alcohol notes and oak are present in the aroma. The taste is rich and bold. Huge whiskey-chocolate notes and shortbread cookies with slight heat from the barrel. Mildly heavy on the palate and delicious with a clean finish. This beer lives up to the hype!! Seek it out now!

3461,"2014-06-20",4.2,"22 oz bottle. Great name! Mahogany with oily tan froth. Nose is fudge, espresso, molasses, oak and bourbon. Creamy, almost full body, with a sharp tang. This one is massive if a bit over done. Taste is dark chocolate, wood, cane sugar and soft bourbon. Even though the flavors are huge the base beer is kind of simple. The barrels impart just enough bourbon to add a complimentary layer of complexity. Excellent work.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3461,"2014-06-17",4.1,"Big beer, exceptionally well done. Motor oil consistency, midnight black in color. Solid base stout. If I can level a criticism, is that this is quite bourbon heavy in flavor. I wouldnt mind seeing it ratcheted down a bit.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"

3461,"2014-05-01",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2016 Bottle at Local Option, Chicago, shared with new friend. Looks amazing - deep oaken darkness with mocha foam. Aroma is booze and woody barrel. Taste is a lot of burnt woodiness - touch smokey from ageing. Palate is full and heavy. Overall, think I prefer the original base beer, but definitely need to revisit this one with a fresher palate.
2nd bottle of 2014 vintage at Tims place, 14/1/2016...enjoyed this one much more than first one - great balance between original beer and some vanilla oak. Great sipper though not much scorched bourbon flavours like first time round. Great beer (4.2).","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","stoutnick"

Aroma and flavor of rich, deep dark chocolate fudge brownie, raisin, fig, date, prune, cinnamon, vanilla toasted coconut, black cherry, molasses, barbeque sauce, marshmallow, leather, tobacco, and spicy rye in the finish. Balanced from beginning of sip through the finish. Body is way north of full, and it carries the aftertaste into a near eternal finish. If I could carp about any aspect of this beer, it would its drinkability, but I wont, because the decadent richness is so all-encompassing that its like a glass of liquid heaven.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"

3461,"2014-04-16",4.3,"Huge thanks to Galen for sharing this one! Rich, thick, oily viscous black pour with a smallish deep brown head. The nose is absolutely gorgeous, with big espresso roast, smooth coffee, milk chocolate, mocha, dates and plums, vanilla, brandy and cognac, marzipan.... the list goes on. The complexity certainly doesnt let up on the palate, with similar barrel character masterfully intertwining with just enough roasted bitterness to balance, despite the base beer having always been on the slightly sweeter end of the style spectrum. Smooth, a touch of heat midway through, but lovely. This is outstanding.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Pours a dark, dark, brown/black. Aroma is strong on bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Taste is smooth and full - with delicious merging of a great stout, bourbon, choc, coffee, vanilla, and that touch of rye.

EvilTwin has been my favorite brewer. Biscotti Break and Even More Jesus rank in my top 5 beers. As the barrel aged version of Biscotti Break made that beer even better, the addition of the rye aging added to EMJ...

Lots of toasty malt and oak on the nose, dark bitter chocolate, roasty coffee, caramel and licorice, and a subtle hint of bourbon. Wow, this is a thick oily beer. The muscovado sugar i feel is more prevalent in this than the base beer, plus nice sweet dark cocoa, mocha, lots of oak, a slight spiciness, caramel and molasses, and just the teeniest amount of bourbon. Really really good beer, but maybe not enough barrel character for my liking.
