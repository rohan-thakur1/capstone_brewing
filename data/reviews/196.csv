W smaku wytrawne, zbożowo - czekoladowe z lekką palonością, nieco mleczne w odczuciu, goryczka niewielka, niewiele pełni, finisz ziołowy, choć bez zalegającej goryczki. W smaku definitywnie porter, mimo, że w aromacie jak BIPA. Ciekawe, smaczne piwo.","Katowice, POLAND","mgajdaczewa"

Appearance - opaque black with a lovely fawn head. 
Nose - jammy fruit, hint of toffee or chocolate in the background. 
Taste - dark fruit confirmed. It could as easily be plum as blueberry. It integrates beautifully and slightly dominates the dark malt notes. 
Palate - medium bodied with a creamy and taut texture. The finish is elegant and balanced. Great. 
Overall - a lovely elegant beer.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"

660ml bottle BBE:31 Dec 2015
Blood alc: 0mg/100ml

Pours black with a big thick beige head which smells, ok, I?ll go with cheesecake and taste like delicious fruity hops. The beer itself has a slightly yeasty smell but this one is very young. It?s very berry like,I think the comparison to blueberries is genuine. The beer is very thick and pretty sweet, a great level of bitterness and there?s some woody complexity going on alongside the berry. The delayed aftertaste is biscuity.This is a pretty excellent beer which doors a great job of doing what, in my mind, moor do, which is to bridge the gap between ?traditional? brewing and ?craft? beer. What I mean is that moor are a good ?gateway? brewery for those not yet fully introduced to many modern styles but still enjoyable for those who are.
