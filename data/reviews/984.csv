984,"2016-12-04",3.7,"Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a hazy burnt yellow color with a light ruddy orange color. Rimmed with a fingers worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Messy lace ends up becoming stringy.
The aroma starts off with some citrus, tropical and grassy hops. Some hay and then lemongrass accompany very nicely. Belgian sugars and a light breadiness.
The flavor brings about that Belgian sweetness nicely and rolling into those previously mentioned hops. Belgian malty sweet aftertaste with a touch of spice blend to form the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good. Nicely executed smooth to bitter agreement on my tongue.
Overall, nicely done Belgian pale ale with a refreshing American hoppy twist. I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

984,"2015-12-11",4.0,"(From notes). Undated 12 ounce bottle served in pint glass. Appreciate the serving instructions on the label. 

Appearance: Pours with a hazy, light orange-gold body and a towering airy bone head ... so much head, I could not get the entire bottle in my pint glass without waiting and drinking. Robust carbonation is also evident in the beer itself. Settling of the head is slow (at least for someone waiting to taste this beer) and leaves blotches of sticky lace on the sides.

Smell: Citrusy hops hit first, from a little distance. Closer sniffing reveals spicy and floral notes, and hints of lightly baked sour dough bread. Nice complex mix of aromas. 

Taste: Nice mix of hops, malt yeast and other flavors. Not as yeasty or spicy as some ""Belgian style"" brews. {This is good thing}. Hints of lemon, generic citrus, pepper, and orange peel. Excellent sweet/bitter balance with little sourness. I also liked the malt/hop balance. Clean and brisk -- not terms that usually come to mind for Belgian style beers. 

Mouthfeel: Medium body. High carbonation is soft, and more obvious by sight than on the tongue. Semi-dry finish. 

Overall: A fine Belgianesque beer with enough hops to make a real difference in flavor and bitterness. Nicely avoids over spicing, but is a little bit over-carbonated.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

I get notes of fresh peaches, white grapes, dried apricots, and funky/doughy yeast.

984,"2014-01-27",4.3,"Heres my updated review from having this on tap:

Modest head but it leaves a combination of blanket and ring lace. The color is dark gold and is lightly hazy.

The smell is a blend of pale malt, Belgian yeast and a touch of hops.

Fits the category well with a superior balance of the pale malts and a (stronger than the smell) hop pepper. Distinctive Belgian yeast is present but not overpowering. The finish features clove and white pepper.

Heres from the bottle:

Huge starting head. As it settles, it leaves less lace than one might expect. Leaves a dome. Still, there is plenty of spots on the glass side. Hazy, golden color.

Fresh pale ale smell consisting of lighter malt and floral hop. Very mild Belgian yeast in the background.

More yeast in the flavor. Starts with a mild grainy malt flavor but ends with a sizable hop bitterness bite. The body is on the full side but the carbonation is also high. Theres also some tartness to the flavor.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"
984,"2014-01-05",3.6,"Pours a hazy orange color with a very large, white, bubbly head. Aroma has a strong lemon and orange nose with a modest spicey note from the yeast - light coriander. Flavor starts off with a strong hoppy presence with a lot of orange, grass, lemon hop notes and quickly moves to a spiciness imparted by the yeast (mostly coriander with a light clove). Body is light and at times feels a bit watery due to the high spicy presence. The beer has a ton of carbonation. Overall a pretty good brew but I wish the citrus in the nose translated just a little more to the flavor to help balance the spice presence.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

984,"2013-01-22",3.9,"Reviewed 1/5/2013. Portion of a 750mL bottle poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a semi-hazy golden color with intense looking carbonation. The head is a four finger offwhite shade. Decent retention, but nice texturing and plenty of patchy lacing.

S: The hops give it a strong herbal, piny, and grassy aroma. All of this melds with the cloves, bubblegum, apple, and ripe pear the Belgian yeast gives off. Not sure of its age, but the aromatic qualities still come together nicely - if a bit too bitterly.

T: Seemingly far more balanced in the flavor than the aroma. Initially, theres a lightly grassy and peppery flavor, before it permutes into a grapefruit sensation on the finish. Theres a touch of toffee (not caramel, though) somewhere in the midtaste. Complex enough (and I do mean enough. No need to ruin this with a haphazard profile) and incredibly refreshing.

M: This one comes across lighter than it may seem, due to the way the finish dries out the yeast and the slight sweetness. Not as carbonated as it initially appeared. Enjoyably crisp.

O: What puts this beyond the average summertime beer is its ability to transport its drinker from cold, dreary doldrums to a grassy field during a warm summers day in Upstate NY. Okay, that was really damn corny, but this beer is THAT refreshing. It makes me wish it wasnt 35 degrees out, thats for sure.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Exactly what I want in a beer. I never thought Belgian yeasts and NW hops could be blended correctly, and this made me very sad. This beer completely changed my outlook on this, and the brewers somehow used Cascadian hops to enhance the flavour. I dont know how they did it, but Ive been learning how to homebrew recently and can think of no other beer which I want to emulate more than this. Its quite expensive here in Canada but Im planning to buy many more.Love the balance between aroma and flavour so much, how they are at once completely new and unexpected, with the citrus hops on the nose and slight Belgian fruitiness on the tongue, yet go together so well.w00t","Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA","WheatKing"

984,"2012-10-10",3.5,"June 8th, 2010 - Ommegangs version of the Belgian Pale Ale is a wonderful, Proustian trip back to old vacations to Europe, ambling around museums and buildings that are generally much older than my country of origin. In particular, the smell reminds me of the aroma of the Louvre - a blend of aging wood, plaster, treated air, and somewhat dressed up tourists. On the edible end of the aroma spectrum I detect banana, nutmeg, black pepper and even some sweet potato - a strange assembly, but enough to cause hunger pangs. The flavor, like the aroma of the sweet potato, is both sweet and savory. Its deep and earthy and caramel sweetness, with a halo of marshmallow sweetness, though subtle and muted. The flavor is calm, served on a placid palate, and struggles to get the attention of my tastebuds, but while the volume might be a little low, Im loving the music.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

984,"2012-08-24",4.2,"From a tulip glass: Beautiful traffic-light yellow with a fragile puffy head. Yeast floating in the amber, which might be a turn off to some, but its just right for me. Got my tongue slapping me in the forehead in anticipation.

The aroma has the horseblanket of a Belgian blonde, but with the citrus hop of a West Coast IPA. There is a touch of funk, but it vascillates between this and a tangerine/grapefruit hop with each sniff. The aroma really takes a few extra minutes of attention.

The taste is slightly sour, or at least it hits the sour part of the tongue. The sourness comes from the yeast, which really tests the limits. (It might not be for everyone, especially if you dont like sour flavors.) But if you are an IPA fan, you will find that the flavors meld beautifully together. 

The feel is very fizzy, very dry, and very thick. It isnt a choker, but it rewards you for taking time with it. This beer is quite unique: the balance between the horsey qualities and the bitter/sweet hops work remarkably well together. Its actually a rather challenging beer: it tunes up the old taste buds. Ive had it before, but today Im digging it probably more than ever.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

A glimmer of orange appears between the bread and bitterness, which makes this a bit more interesting.  Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is lively.

984,"2011-09-10",4.1,"Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to large wine glass, package date 03/25/11best by date 03/2012

Appearance (4/5): Glowing, hazy golden body with a dense, 2 ½ finger, bone white head slowly fading to a ½ finger head. Good, moderate lacing.

Smell (7/10): Light, bready, crisp malt scents with a characteristic Ommegang yeast noteslightly fruity, slightly floral, and biscuity.

Taste (8/10): Crisp, bready malt with grassy hops following right behind. Hop profile sticks around, moving from grassy to a very light citrus flavor backed by that crisp, biscuity malt base. The hops open up a bit as it goes on, ranging from grassy to lemony, until that end of the hop profile sits on top of the crisp biscuity malt body. Very tasty, very light and very drinkable, actually.

Mouthfeel (5/5): Smooth, very fine carbonation that sticks around, light and velvety but not thick at all. Really excellent feel in the mouth.

Overall (17/20): Not many of Ommegangs beers are as light and quaffable as this is, they tend to be better for savoring and sipping. This is a very nice, approachable Belgian pale, and a good introduction to the style.

UPDATE (9/5/11): Had this super-fresh at the brewery recently, and I have to say that when the hops are freshest, they have a very bright, bitter presence that really turns it into a somewhat different beer; its good to very good if the hops have faded a bit, but very good to excellent when theyre bright and fresh!","Syracuse, New York, USA","fmccormi"

The aroma is full of fruit, banana, melon, citrus, its a damn fruit of the month club up in my glass. There are some dank hop notes and a little touch of damp cellar in there as well. The flavor is this really great interplay between fruity esters, hop bitterness, & citrus hop flavor. The beer starts of with a sort of sweet note but it doesnt take long before it dries out and the finish leaves you with almost a brut like sensation. The malt isnt really hidden here, but its in the background. Mild notes of cracker and honey do wonders for the whole balance of the beer. Instead of bringing sweetness to the table (that with this yeast profile would overwhelm) the malt brings subtle and complimentary flavors. 
This is a genuine marriage between Belgian and North American style brewing where neither really take center stage but rather nicely play off one another. I think a funky version of this would really be something else entirely.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

984,"2011-06-05",3.8,"THOUGHTS: The first Ommegang beer Im not totally in love with. Its not awful. It was just not to my taste. The yeast and dry hopping clashed to me. For hops to work in a Belgian beer they need to be a stronger style. Id love to try this without the dry hopping. It did grow on me, but it is still probably my least favorite Ommegang beer. It actually did get quite nice as it warmed even more, but it still wasnt really my cup of tea. It did pair nice with some extra sharp. white cheddar.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a hazy, dark yellow to light orange with a huge, meringue-like, off-white head that mostly, but very slowly diminished and left good, thick and clingy lacing. The aroma had light to moderate light bread and pale malt; a hint of caramel; moderate to heavy pine hops, some citrus hops, less pineapple hops; light to moderate soapy and spicy yeast; and oranges. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, light to moderately bitter and lightly acidic; while the finish was light to moderately sweet, ever so slightly sour and moderately bitter with an average on flavor and long on dry finish. There was pale malt, sort of wheat, pine and citrus hops, yeast, orange rind, very fresh hop flavor without extreme bitterness, hints of pineapple, oranges, slightly minty and herbal hops. The light to medium body was dry with sort of soft, yet tingly carbonation and a dry finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

984,"2011-05-30",3.5,"(12oz bottle packaged on 1/24/2011 served in a Belgian ale tulip) Pours a clear gold with some sediment and a luxurious 4 finger head that slowly disappates and maintains a 1 finger prescence.  Aroma is slight Belgian yeast spice, big caramel candy sugar sweetness, and some minor citrus peel on account of the dry hopping.  Taste is Cascade hops (similar to but on a lesser scale than Sierra Nevada Pale) signature grapefruit, followed by a clean caramel candy malt note and finishing very dry with a whisper of Belgian yeast and lingering grapefruit.  On the palate it is highly effervescent which gives its medium body a full, foamy mouthfeel.  This is a great transition beer for hop maniacs like myself who have an aversion to heavy Belgian yeast but are looking to branch out into the wide world of Belgians.

984,"2011-05-29",2.5,"Spicy and dry, yet odd and prickly, I cant find much love for Ommegangs BPA.  While it has the appearance of a Belgian brew, I was expecting a more American nose.  The hops are there, but the Belgian yeast hogs the spotlight.  For a Belgian Ale, BPA tastes sparkly but bland and lacking any defined direction, save a little soapy, floral herb twist on the finish.  As a Pale Ale, the hops take their time showing up, and only provide a token appearance before scurrying away, only to reappear in your belches.  The Belgian-style texture doesnt really work with the hoppy leanings, since it scours your tongue before any resinous IBUs can sink in.  Interesting, but not anything close to Ommegang at their best.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

Aroma is orange citrus, some peaches, grassy and herbal, some banana, yeast and bread.  A bit of funk comes out with a strong swirl being the only distractor in an otherwise fine aroma.  Good strength.

Flavor is lemon and orange citrus, banana and a bit of bubblegum, some grassy hops, fair malt sweetness which is balanced by some bitterness on the finish.

Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, a bit oily, good carbonation.

Well, color me impressed considering this is a bit over one year old and has held up quite well.  Couldnt pass up the single on the discount rack for 99 cents, definitely will seek out a fresh sample and update this review then.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

984,"2011-04-28",4.0,"12 ounce bottle - $2.69 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours out a clear, orange-gold body with a tall, proud, airy white head. Splotches of sticky lace on the descent.

Smell: Rustic whole-grain sour dough bread accented by traces of sweetness and a rich array of spicy, fruity, floral notes.

Taste: Bready, coarse-grain maltiness with sweetness hinting at a bit of light caramel as well as a drizzling of basic simple syrup. Next, flavors from both the Ommegang house yeast and American-Slovenian hop mix struggle out competing complexities, giving tastes of pears, lemon peel, acidic grapefruit juice, ground white pepper, cloves, dried herbs, day-old dough, and light underlying cellar-like funk. A generous, though not overblown bitterness is present. Some alcohol warmth bordering the dry, zestful finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high carbonation. Its got that smooth and sticky yet also fizzing on the tongue thing going on.

Overall: A nice Belgian-inspired beer where the hops and yeast steal the show. The alcohol is up there, though not entirely disproportionate. Still, I appreciate the 12-ounce portion, instead of having to drain an entire bomber bottle.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

984,"2011-04-14",3.2,"Picked up at State Line Liquors. Poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

Initial pour brings a murky apricot-orange color with a bit of darker orange around the edges. A pretty hard pour brought out a three-finger head that was quite rough and tumbly; really rocky. Single finger persists throughout. Great sticky lacing all over the glass. Big and soapy bubbles.

Initial whiff brings some nice notes of peach and light tropical fruits as well as a bit of light pepper. A bit of very light floral hops comes through as well. Some very mild earthy must in there as well. The taste is some light stone fruits as well as a bit of must and spice. Body is a bit light with low-to-moderate carbonation levels. Glad to have finally gotten ahold of this, but not my favorite.

A-Body is a uniformly translucent golden yellow hue. Pours with a 3 finger + foamy white head. Head slowly fades to 1 finger and leaves LOTS and LOTS of lacing behind in the glass. Translucency is minimum.

S- Nose is somewhat mild but offers a profile typical and good for the style. Belgian candi sugar, mild soft, floral hops, lemon, and sweet bready yeast.

T- Flavor is very good-stronger and more balanced than the nose. Upfront is a mild lemon and tropical fruit flavor with a sweet backbone. Spiciness and breadiness slowly come through just before the finish and intensify. Floral hops accent the finish. What lingers is a touch of floral hops and a moderate amount of peppery spice as well as a hint of sugar and citrus.

M- High carbonation and lightweight drinkable body. Body is slightly juicy.

D- This is a very good BPA overall. Its drinkable, almost sessionable, and full of flavor. Another fantastic brew by Ommegang-one of my favorite breweries.

A - Light, crisp golden orange color with a large, foamy, light, sticky, fluffy and rocky, white head. Really good retention that sticks around for a long time and leaves a nice layer of lace.

S - Strong Belgian yeast characteristics. A touch of spiciness and lemon citrus. Subsequent whiffs get more American hop aromas on the nose. Some tropical fruit with pineapple, mango, tangerine, and apricot. Also a nice amount of ripe golden fruit. Just a little bit of a musty finish on the nose.

T - Really nice combination of Belgian yeast and American hops. Starts with a big kick of tropical fruit and golden fruit. Pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, and others all present coming in and out. Slightly sweet flavor but a faint bitter bite. Then the spicy Belgian yeast flavors come into play. Faint candi sugar and dry bready flavors in the background.

M - Lighter side of medium body with average carbonation. Nice sprizty feel, but just a little too thin.

D - Really enjoyed drinking this. It went down easy with the nice mix of Belgian yeast and spiced characteristics and the American hops bringing a fruity aspect. Sweet and spice nicely balanced.

Notes: I really enjoyed this beer. Sweet, fruity flavors present, but the spice really cuts it and provides a nice contrast. Really zesty and refreshing to drink.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Nose: bright with tons of dry tropical fruits up front. Coriander, grains of paradise, and white pepper abound, tickling my nose with each snuff. Dry husked grains underneath; grape nuts. An overall zesty tropical fruity essence with a touch of green.

Palate: sweet in the middle with a mild front. Pineapple, guava, and mango skins for bitter-sweet tropical essence. Green of palm and aloe underneath. The palate dries slowly, lingering with the bitterness of fruit skins and dry baled hay. Spice lingers in the back and in my breath. As she warms white grapefruit joins the tropical fray, the rind especially.

Its a classic yet-boundary pushing Pale Ale in that it has a robust bitter finish behind the dry hopped grassy/citrusy palate, balanced nicely with a hint of fruity malts.  Yet its also a fantastic Belgian ale, in that the Yeast is full and flavorful, while never dominating, allowing the fruity malt/hop combo to do its sweet thang.

Appearance: The body is hazy and has an orange/gold colored body with a creamy light beige head. Its head is tall and frothy which makes nice spotty and slippery lace on the glass. As I slowly drink the head slowly settles to thin cap of foam that lasts to the last sip.

Smell: In the nose I pick up sweet fruity and funky yeast with some bready maltiness and light floral/citrusy and spicy hops.

Taste/Palate: On the tongue there is a similar mix of what was picked up in the aroma. I get notes of fresh peaches, white grapes, dried apricots, and funky/doughy yeast. This has a sweet character that begins to dry out as some of the hops move in and adds there mild bitterness and floral, citrusy grapefruit flavor.

The bar was set kind of high for this beer which is why it may have fallen short. Regardless I could not get into it all that much despite an interesting mixture of flavors and texture. That wont stop me from keeping up with Ommegang as they crank out new experiments like the Zuur and a Scottish ale however. Just make sure to get a fresh bottle and you should be fine.

Aroma / Appearance - Carbonated and bronze the appearance did not give away anything other than the expected. A rich white head was so intense it took a few minutes for the beer to actually settle to a drinkable level. Grapefruit, orange rinds, melons, and strands of cotton candy give it a fruity playful tone.

Flavor / Palate - The fluid mouthfeel is light with little residual impact on either the tongue or throat. Fading almost like the cotton candy it tastes like the delicacy is a minor turnoff. I was not expecting a huge in your face statement. It is nice though for the finish to last more than two seconds. I cant complain about the cost though - at $5.99 this was very much in the affordable ""check it out"" price bracket.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

984,"2010-08-07",3.7,"Corked bottle and served in my Ommegang tulip: Slightly hazy golden hue topped by a fluffy white head which left spotty lacework upon the glass. The aroma has notes of citric PNW as well as milder herbal noble hops, lots of fruity esters (mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pear), moderately hop spiced with pepper and clove, pale pils and two-row malts, and a dusty yeast vapour. The taste is moderately reserved which is a good thing as too many of these hoppy Belgian Ales I have had of late are too hop forward and honestly clash... that is NOT an issue with the BPA. The hops work very well with the malt bill providing a approachable balance yet still interesting complexity that hits the spot. The moderate fruity component and finishing hop spice tones add to the palate. Only the slight metallic undertone caused me concern. The mouth feel is lively but there is a growing chalkiness that I find annoying after awhile.  Overall I found this to be a solid offering that I would gladly try again. I think Ommegangs history and respect to the Belgian styled ales kept them grounded to what this beer should be, not overly hopped to the point of becoming an IPA and for that I am happy. If only this brew was cleaner and less chalky/metallic then this would be a higher level of happiness.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

A fair amount of white pepper, citrus, and zesty minerals in the aroma; has the pepperiness and yeast character of a tripel, a very soft, non-intrusive malt core (lightly biscuity) and a prominent citrus / mineral hop note; very solid, lively aroma, with some hints of grassy, herbaceous notes that fit with the dry hopping; mouthwatering.

984,"2010-05-01",3.7,"A big amount of chill haze has formed in this beer since I put it in the fridge two days ago.  A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces almost four-fingers worth of nicely tanned foam.  The head slowly falls with pillowy mounds of froth that leaves a rocky surface on the top fo the foam.  The beer is a murky, light amber color that shows a rich haze and lighter copper hues when held up to the light.  Earthy yeast notes mix with spicy herbal hop aromas followed by citrus hop notes in the first whif of the aroma.  My second waft of the aroma sees me noticing tropical fruit hop notes much more with notes of lychee, floral peach and perhaps a touch of kumquat or tangelo zest.  Earthy, spicy malt character is accentuated by fruity fermentation notes, and spicy phenolics; this last is a touch musty, a hint of medicinal, with some solid, supporting clove aromatics.  The malt becomes more noticeable as my nose adjusts to the hops, toasted whole grain bread aromatics, rye crackers and fresh crushed grain notes all are apparent.  In addition to the hops, there are other fruit notes of pear and perhaps a light melon like character.  The aroma on this is interestingly complex, and I am quite enjoying the interplay of Belgian yeast, American Hops and malt.

Sweet grapefruit hop flavors are noticeable as the beer first hits my tongue.  The beer dries out quite a bit as it rolls across my tongue though; the malt character is overall dry, but the hops accentuate an up front sweetness that just lingers on the palate even in the long finish.  Both the peppery carbonation and the hops provide a biting, bitter note that is found throughout the flavor profile, but especially lingering in the finish.   Touches of pine and a definite herbal edge also linger towards and into the finish of each sip.  The malt contributes a soft dough-like flavor, some toasted cracker notes as well as a rustic, crushed grain character that lingers in the finish.  It is interesting that the fermentation character accentuates a lychee / tropical fruit flavor from the Cascade hops.  The texture of this beer is fizzy from the ample carbonation, but well tamed by a creamy texture; overall this is quite quaffable and certainly light enough to be what I was expecting labeled as a BPA.  Fermentation spice notes of clove (this is actually quite big and mixes quite well with the hop character), woody black pepper and pink ginger play a bigger and bigger role as the beer warms up.

In a world were there are few commercial examples of American hops and Belgian inspired yeast strains (especially under 7%) this is a really nice beer.  I cant see this standing up if a lot more of these get made though.  As it is though, I am thoroughly enjoying this beer.  My biggest complaint is that the malt seems to muddle things a bit; it does add complexity, but seems to get in the way of the crisp hops and interesting yeast character, though it does add extra complexity, which isnt really needed in a beer chock-full hops and yeast character.  This would also be a bit lighter and more refreshing without the extra malt character; and I dont think that would be a bad thing.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Palate is medium bodied with a crisp and fairly dry finish. Nice brew overall.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

984,"2010-04-28",4.0,"Draught at the Red.   Glowing orange-copper with a medium white head that collapses in a short time, but leaves a nice layer of foam.   Bright fruity aroma that seems like a nice combination of bright fruity esters and the cascade hops used post-fermentation.   Peach, apricot and mint, almost with some floral touches.   The flavor has a uicy fruit sweetness that dries out pretty well in the finish but lacks much bitterness or alcohol presence.   The malts are on the lighter side with a cake dough and grainy quality.   Medium-light on texture with soft but present carbonation.   Pretty nice stuff overall, and quite drinkable.   This was much better than what I see most people describing from bottled ratings, so Im thinking it came out better in kegged form--maybe the dry hops are really adding something to the aroma that was lost on the bottling line.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
984,"2010-04-28",3.7,"750ml, caged and corked bottle. Poured a medium and lightly hazy golden color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas of citrus/lemons, floral hops, and breadiness. Tastes of citrus, citrus rinds, floral, and bready. Lively body.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
984,"2010-04-27",3.2,"750ml bottle.  Pours increasingly hazy throughout the bottle, downright cloudy at the final glass.  The color is a stratified, glowing, dusky orange-amber, and there is a billowing head of thick, off-white foam that lasts.  Sticky, clumpy swaths of lacing cling hard to the glass.  The aroma is kind of mundane, showing notes of dried bread, biscuit, and dried apricots amidst countering hints of stale tropical fruit and a bit of grass.  Funky, dry, bretty Belgian yeast seems more of an annoyance than a positive contributor.  Likewise, flavors fall flat, with dry, woody, funky brett yeast dulling an otherwise unique tropical hop profile.  The bready, doughy malts are too assertive as well.  On the tongue, a moderate body comes across semi-dry and mostly boring.  Overall, its a decent, drinkable Belgian pale, but Ive had dozens better within this increasingly popular style, and the pricetag is completely unjustified.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Head is initially large, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.

984,"2010-04-25",2.9,"Bronzed straw-yellow. Tight spackle of froth slowly establishes itself with a gentle pour. Banana taffy, bubblegum, apricot jam, pear syrup, melon (muskmelon, cantaloupe), and peppery alcohol line the estery but fairly dull nose. Distant clove, sulfur, and some very faint floral hop suggestions. Relatively alcoholic and very yeasty with notes of pistachio and paint. Watery and flimsy body.  Fluffy carbonation. Fruity and slick with a citrus marmalade hop character and  a contrasting scratch of alcohol, upfront. Hops are somewhat floral, though there is a disharmonious canned-mandarin-orange element, as well. What hoppy brightness is perceptible is unable to thrive beneath the paintlike yeast and off-putting banana taffy which blanket the palate with a filmy residue. Dry crackery malt accents never become more than a mere whisper due to the lack of cleanness. Slight mineralic grit offers short-lived relief from the omnipresence of alcohol and doughy yeast. Hop bitterness, while clean, lies buried beneath the yeastiness. Closes with a vaguely herbal and grassy hop flourish alongside light fusel astringency, cakey malt, unripe banana and honey-drizzled toasted malt. All beer should be clean, and its absolutely mandatory that a Belgian golden be just that. Very displeased with the yeast character and the rampant banana taffy, lack of lively phenolics, to name a few things. About what one would expect from this mediocre-at-best brewery.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The flavor picks up where the nose began, and delivers perhaps the best overall mix of American and Belgian flavor available in the U.S.  The beer mimicks la Chouffes beautiful earthy hop flavor, as well as a dry and almost tart finish that allows the beer to be at once complex and deep whilst remaining quite refreshing.

Dark orange haze color, with a fluffy head that fades away quite slowly. Looks like a damn good Belgian ale to me. Bubblegum Belgian yeast aroma poking through with a subtle but refreshing hop aroma. Yeast and sugar are the dominating aromas. Aroma is pungent and aromatic, but you have to realize that this aroma is very sweet smelling. I am not really getting much of a hop aroma. When I taste this beer, I would have to say it is damn near perfect. Belgian yeast and sugar are present, at first. Then I get that lingering citrus bitterness that mixes almost perfectly with the sweet sugar and Belgian yeast flavor(s). The bitterness is not caustic or incisive, but it develops quite well to where it is not intrusive, but complimentary. Banana aroma coming through more, in terms of aroma, as the beer warms. Fresh hop flavor at first, and the a somewhat creamy, but amply carbonated texture provide the perfect taste. A damn fine offering from an unpretentious brewery. This beer is extremely subtle, and yet it provides the right flavors at the right time. A bit too carbonated. Also, if the hop profile was pushed up a bit, this would be perfect.

984,"2009-08-05",3.7,"Tap at BCTC. Lightly cloudy yellow color, minimal head. Light Belgian hoppy funk. Nice, dry light boddy, with a crispy and lemony hop backing things up. Pineapple characteristics remind me slightly of batch 1 Cuvee de Castleton, though there is little int he way of sour here.
