4214,"2017-02-14",4.1,"Thanks Virby44 for the bottle! Poured into a snifter showing very dark wine red with half a finger of tanned cherry foam. 

The nose shows a lot of juicy and ripe raspberry with hints of steel tank. 

The palate is light bodied and lightly carbonated. A lot of juicy raspberry with a very subtle tartness and a moderate sweetness but completely balances with the beer. Finish is once again more raspberry. Very light malt profile revealed on the end. Drinks similar to juice and could use a bit more tartness but still refreshing and juicy.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

Appearance: Crimson red body looking almost liked pureed raspberries with a thin head.

Smell: All rapsberries here, aroma of freshly picked berries, looking good.

Taste: A rush of raspberries hits you, tart & bitter but no apparent sweetness maybe masked by the tartness.

Mouthfeel: Fizziness in the mouthfeel, bold & heavy taste, a little too heavy maybe. Dominant flavor is raspberries (of course!) which have a over-ripened feel to them.","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"

4214,"2016-10-12",3.6,"One of New Glarus best known fruit beers, at B.U.M.B. in Antwerp. Lacing, off-white, moussy, stable head, warm and practically clear copper reddish colour with orangey hue. Aroma strongly reminiscent of (home made) raspberry jam, ripe fresh redcurrant, vanilla, Roosvicee or even rosehip tea, some caramel, almond. Sugary raspberry jam dominates the flavor, with a thin and shy redcurrant- or rhubarb-like acidity buried underneath, medium carbo, soft bready and caramelly core but the sweet raspberry flavor persists till deep into the finish, sugary and even a bit cloying, but the acidity still lurks from below and keeps it tolerable. The result of this, as with the other sweet New Glarus fruit beers, is a genuine, artisanal dessert-like sweetness, which I experience as being very different from many industrial sweet beers here in Western Europe (mainly Belgium). Some of these Belgian sweet fruit beers, including the Lindemans lambics which served as an example for New Glarus back in the nineties, attain a similar character of non-industrial yet still heavy sugariness leaving room for actual fruit (juice) flavors; New Glarus essentially translated this concept from lambic to the (then) new American sour ale style and can be seen as a kind of modern craft beer-era tribute to the old Lindemans or (at least previously) even Timmermans fruit beers. Whether you like very sweet fruit beers or not, there is no denying that New Glarus is one of the breweries worldwide that has raised this concept to its maximum in terms of honesty and quality.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4214,"2016-10-11",3.4,"At Hopishop 2016. Aroma of raspberry jam and mild tart. Taste has sweet raspberry jam, candy and no tart. This is really sweet stuff, drinkable, but not very complex or interesting.","NETHERLANDS","MarcoDL"
4214,"2016-10-09",4.2,"750 ml. bottle sampled @ HopisHop B.U.M.B. 2016. Deep red amber. Nose is pure sweet raspberry jam, sweet & sugar heavy down to the point of almost seeming a bit artificial. Their Belgian Red reminded me of Lindemans Kriek & this one reminds me of Lindemans Framboise but this one isnt as good, sparkling taste, extreme & very sweet raspberry jam, pure sugar, candy, almost artificial sweet, far too sweet for its own good, not sure if I could drink a lot of it. Fizzy raspberry jam & sugar body. Crazily sweet but good since I do like raspberry jam after all. I still think that it is funny that beer geeks look down on the sweet Lindemans beers but worship these candy New Glarus beers.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

4214,"2016-05-03",4.1,"Another beer Id never have the pleasure of trying without John Erb, who never seems to leave his home state of Wisconsin before considering his friends beer hobby. Aroma: The raspberry character is at once candied and tart; theres some lighter, but healthy level of dark chocolate as well. Appearance: Slightly hazy chocolate raspberry pour with soft carbonation holding up an off-pink head that settles into a thin ring. Flavor: Candied raspberry and chocolate with tartness more subtle initially; candied elements and chocolate back off to give the light tartness a boost; the tartness continues on through the lingering finish. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, lingering finish. Overall: After having Serendipity and Belgian Red, the novelty of these NG fruit beers has worn off a bit. That said, this is still stellar stuff, and one Id definitely recommend without reservation.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

4214,"2016-02-02",4.1,"Im not sure how ive never rated this, but this is and always has been one of my favourite fruit beers, ever, since right when I turned twenty-one! Deep dark red coloured body with a ruby tinted head that fades relatively fast. Bright aroma of tart raspberries, icing sugar, sour grapes, blackberries, strawberries, very light malt and many more raspberries and sugar. Medium-bodied; Super pungent raspberry flavour with a bright fruit note, some subdued grain and earthy maltiness, but the sugars really come out, along with the bright raspberry notes. Aftertaste shows a very nice, refined raspberry flavour, some sourness from the yeast and a little earthy maltiness, but the pervasive (in a good way) raspberry cant be missed. Overall, a very nice beer that is elegant in almost every way, but very sweet as well, with a bright tartness near the end. A great beer that should be at sampled at every turn, even if you live in Wisconsin and can find this regularly, but especially if you are from out of state and dont have access to this on a daily basis. I sampled this 75 cL bottle purchased from Festival Foods (De Pere) in Green Bay, Wisconsin on 29-July-2012 for US$8,99 sampled at home on my youngest daughters first birthday party, on 30-January-2016 at home in Washington, after purchasing this before my first daughter was ever born!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

The aroma is incredibly sweet raspberries. Its like a jam, almost to a point of being slightly off-putting. I was hoping for a little more of a tartness than the sweet bomb here. Its still good, but doesnt play into what the name suggests. The flavor is great. Lots of raspberry lots of syrup, and even a little bit of jam. The tartness comes through a little on the back end, but again, I was hoping for a little more. The mouth feel is thicker and jammy, with a soft carbonation lingeringly great fruity sweet finish.

The taste is highly sweet with a medium high sour, a light bitter, and maybe even a bit salty, too. The beer is thin, yet oily, and a bit sticky as it warms. The carbonation is bubbly and fizzy. The light body contains notes raspberries throughout the drink (so much raspberry). It finishes crisp with raspberries, a little bit of pie crust, and grass at the finish.

A little oxidation perhaps brings the carbonation too high, which takes away from the feel and the overall impression of the beer, but its still quite good, and the sweet tart aspect lingers after youre done.

Watery palate, the dried? hops are not really creating enough of a dry mouthfeel for me here. Some nice vanilla from the cask. An excellent showcasing of gorgeously fresh and fleshy raspberries in a very fruity and refreshing drink, but far from an artwork in terms of sour beer brewing/blending - this lacks a Framboise lambieks complexity and depth. - Have to go with diabels older but still valid Belgocentric evaluation here.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Pours a murky, copper-brown with some amber hues and a medium sized, tan head of medium light thickness. Recedes fairly quickly to the edges where it lingers for a bit before disappearing. Light lacing and small legs. 
Flavor starts with a fairly strong sweetness and a moderate raspberry jam character. Like the aroma there is a medium light pale malt and faint chocolate background character. Faint bitterness with some light tartness. Really tastes a lot like liquid jam. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very sweet, jammy beer with tons of raspberry flavor and aroma. Light malt background notes and faint tartness. A beer for non beer people.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

S: Raspberries, slightly tart. Not much else. As advertised.

T: Sweet with hints of tart raspberries. A little too sweet for my preferences....EDIT: I threw a cork in this and returned to it several days later to find the beer much more enjoyable. A bit of oxidation and flattening out brought the flavors into a more balanced profile.

4214,"2013-11-30",4.8,"This has to be one of my top rated beers. It's not your typical hop beer. Definitely a fruit beer, but I LOVE fruit, so this is right up my alley. Aroma of awesome cherry and raspberries. Creamy offwhite head which lasts. Fair lacing. Nice tartness which lasts for a long while, eventually leading off to a metallic aftertaste.

A - Pours a deep dark red/violet hue that is clear but lets little light through. Looks very wine like. Two fingers of dense tan/pink stained foam forms but settles into some thin patching. Swirling does generate an impressive new layer of foam and leaves behind some lacing. This might be a fruit beer, but it is not thin in the least bit.

S - Raspberry jam. Thats it. Obviously its pretty one dimensional, but when that lone dimension is amazingly ripe and tart raspberries itss pretty acceptable. Oh how I love this aroma.

T - Tart and sweet raspberries with just a touch of wheat which is found in the other NG fruit beers. The finish is ever so slightly acidic. It gets to be a bit much after a while but it absolutely nails the raspberry flavor. Mouth feel is thick and syrupy with moderate carbonation.

O - New Glarus really impresses me with these fruit beers. This is just the most honestly raspberry forward thing Ive have ever had that wasnt an actual raspberry. Not as exciting as Serendipity but just as wonderful as the Belgian Red.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Body is light but packed with raspberry aftertaste and a champagne like quality.  You could drink this all day long on any day, but I think it would go best with an outdoor sunday fruit brunch on a brisk autumn day when the leaves are changing color.  Definitely one of the my favorites, and dominating in the world of fruit beers.  New Glarus may have topped all competitors for all times with this and the Belgian Red.

4214,"2012-10-04",3.3,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Founders snifter. Split with my buddy for his birthday day.

A: Pours a dark purple with nice cherried hues woven throughout, but mainly on the edges. Light pink 1 finger head that lingered for a little while, then instantly dissipated.

S: Very light berries up front and then it sort of morphs into a nice sweetness, almost like a fruit roll-up or fruit by the foot. I pick up a slight bread-like malt on the back end. These smells were all very light and it took some effort to find them.

T: Very nice semi-tart mixed berries up front with a nice dry malt bill. This gives way to a nice sweetness that lingers throughout the middle and back end, just like the nose. Slightly less medicinal than the Belgian Red.

M: Medium bodied with an oily mouthfeel. Coats the palate with a semi-bitter berry. Medium carbonation.

O: While I dont like fruit or vegetable beers, New Glarus has definitely upped the ante and made me at least enjoy them. While I probably wont try this one again, Im glad I did because Im always trying to expand my horizons and if there is a beer that can sway me Im all for it.

4214,"2012-05-11",3.9,"Side-by-side comparison of a 750ml bottle from 2010 picked up at the Historic Casanova Liquors in Hudson, WI and a 750ml bottle from 2012 picked up last week at Sadhana Wine Shop in Madison, WI. Both pour a deep brown body with a ruby tint as well as a finger-width, frothy, creamy and slightly fizzy, beige head that dissipate slowly and leave solid lacings throughout. The new bottle is clear and leaves a bit less of a lacing than the two-year-old version. The 2012s aroma is loaded with very bright and fresh raspberries with a light sweetness and tartness. The 2010s aroma is still packed with raspberries and gives off a really nice natural smell, but smells more like an aged jam with a bit more of a tartness mixing with the light sweetness. I get a bit of a rounded, bready pale malt backing as well. The flavors are similar. The 2012 starts with just a light tartness and plenty of fresh raspberries before the sweetness of the fruits comes on nicely with just a light malt feel. Finishes clean and smooth with a light tartness and a really nice, fresh raspberry sweetness that isnt cloying at all. The 2010 starts with a light tartness as well as plenty of raspberries. Not quite as fresh, but still really natural. The sweetness comes along nicely and gives off a bit more of a syrupy or jam flavor, but it doesnt feel syrupy. Finishes clean and smooth with a bit more of a pale malt backing than the 2012. The 2012 seems to have just the slightest hint of hops in the finish making it a bit more crisp than the 2010. Both leave lengthy aftertastes following very smooth, medium-light bodies giving off a somewhat creamy feel and light carbonations. Overall, this is pretty straightforward, but its a really enjoyable and impressive fruit beer. Tons of fresh raspberries with a light sweetness and tartness that are nicely balanced throughout. The raspberries hold up really well in a two-year-old bottle, although I think I like the fresher bottle better. Never cloying and very natural. Great beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Crisp body due to a moderate amount of carbonation. Semi-spritzy, but in a good way. Complements the style superbly. Flavor is unsurprisingly of tart red fruits.

Ruby red pour with an average head that quickly disipates.  Nose is lots of cherries and some yeast and grain.  Taste is one of the best of any style.  A cherry malt bomb that is sweet but with a nice tartness on the back end.  Better than sparkling wine (which many compare it to) as the malt cuts into the sweetness very nicely.

4214,"2012-03-01",4.2,"Purchased Jan 2011 at Woodmans in Oak Creek, WI, price $7.80. 2,400th Rating! Pours a pinkish brown in a small sampling chalice, ring of foam. Smell is sweet raspberry juice, nothing else in the way. Taste is raspberries in cream with just a little bit of tartness on the side. A very slight hint of barnyard flavor based on the spontaneous ferment in wood. My previous rating was for a gluten-free raspberry brew, but this one still keeps in beer heritage with slightly thick malt, more in the mouthfeel than on the palate. I ask the same question I asked with my first Dark lord: is this really worth all the fuss? I agree, it may be the best fruit beer you can find, and its different than any other fruity alco-pop.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
4214,"2012-02-28",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/13/2010.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.

Raspberry Tart pours a murky deep ruby cherry color with a fluffy pink head. 

Just a ton of raspberries wafting up into the nose. Sweet and tart, just how a bowl of mashed raspberries smells. Pretty awesome.

As the beer rolls over a new spot on the tongue, the flavor moves from sweet, then tart raspberries. Very robust and accurate portrayal of raspberries. Slightly tangy toward the end. 

Crisply carbonated so the bubbles dance on my tongue. Smooth, medium feel, which complements the taste really well. Sticky and just a touch syrupy -- really the only negative thing I can say about this beer.

This gets a strong score from me because of the great raspberry taste. I am extremely tough on fruit beers, raspberry in particular, and this is a great one. This is a situation beer though, perfect to pair with a dessert or brunch.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

The smell is very candy-like. It is mostly sugar and raspberries with a hint of oak, Im not a huge fan of the oak barrels New Glarus uses, there is just something a bit off with it that affects the scent.

The taste is phenomenal though, pure sweet and tart raspberry goodness. Not very sour, it is more of a tart flavor, hence the name. I definitely prefer the more balanced tartness over the acid bombs that some of these beers can be.

This is a great beer with just about any dessert, highly drinkable, drink it cold.

4214,"2011-01-18",4.6,"Poured into a tulip. Thanks to alcstradamus for this one.

4.5 A: Clear somewhere between ruby red and burgundy color. Two fingers of ever so slightly pink frothy head. Pretty good retention and moderate lacing.

4.0 S: Wow, the raspberries! Tart raspberries totally dominate the nose and dont allow for any other aromas to be perceived other than a general vinousness. Of course, I have no problem with this since raspberries smell great.

5.0 T: Wow again. Totally wasnt expecting it to be so full bodied and flavorful. Most fruit beers are scant on the fruit and make what tastes like a watered down beer mixed with a watered down fruit juice. Not this one! Whether justified or not, I really like Lindemans Framboise and this is in several ways a bigger, bolder version of that. Raspberries are pretty much the sole flavor and give only a mild tartness. Loads of residual sweetness, which could contribute to a low level of perceived tartness.

5.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation is spritzy and dances on the tongue. Somewhat sticky, but super smooth.

5.0 D: I really like it. I have another bottle in the cellar that Im tempted to open up, but I must resist. Gotta share. The people of Pittsburgh need to know about this one.

4214,"2010-11-07",4.2,"Aroma- raspberry, oak.  pours royal blood red.  taste is raspberry, raspberry jam, oak, hint of cinnamon.  The flavor is amazing in that it tastes like a wild raspberry right off the bush.  The after taste of earthy oak and dark fruit perfectly complements the sweetness that came before.  palate is light bodied, medium carbonation, refreshing.  This one is difficult to stop drinking.","Bowling Green, Ohio, USA","gormanb"

It was so tasty that I nearly forced a glass on my neighbor Barry as he pulled into the drive.  Gentle nose of fruit.  A light rose in the glass with steady carbonation.  Body is light to medium, slick buyt not cloying.  A pleasure to consume from start to finish.  A light tartness near finish realy ties this together.","Hippetown East, New York, USA","coldbrewky"

4214,"2010-09-23",4.3,"Pours a beautiful bright pale pink with a tall, loose, white head with a whisper of pink.  Striking, sweet aroma of raspberries that does come across as sour, but in multiple ways from both the acidity of the fruit and the fermentation agents.  The body is light and airy and delivers a tart pickle on the palate with the clear flavor of fresh raspberries and very soft malt and hops.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Aroma is of raspberry (if i didnt know the name of this beer I would have guessed at least some sweet berry was involved). Flavor... wow.  This is a dessert!  You cant tell theres any alcohol in this *or* that its even a beer.  An amazingly delicious treat if youre in the mood for a dessert beer.  Easy.  This is candy!","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Aroma dominated by raspberries, oddly some cherries as well, very sweet.  Appearance ruby red, clear, thin head.  Taste very tart at first, then subsides the more you drink.  Very sweet, great raspberry taste and mouthfeel.  Would definitely have this again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

4214,"2010-09-05",4.5,"Bottle. Big snappy aroma of crushed raspberries, light spiciness, earth, mild sour fruit notes, ozone, milled fresh grain. An excellent, rousing aroma, just right up into your nostrils and waking up your senses. Flavor has highly concentrated berry flavor, like a mouthful of sticky berries. Prickly tartness follows along with a nice, very subtle herb-like, mellowness imparted by the hops. Tart and sweet juices coat the mouth long after a swig.

4214,"2010-08-26",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2010 Bottle. 24.5 oz. Split with James. Pours a clear electric ruby maroon with a two-finger, bubbly off-white head that dissipates quickly, leaving outrageously beautiful lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma of fresh raspberry jam spread on warm toast, malts, dark cherries, plums, cranberries, and slight notes of honey and orange marmalade. Thin bodied with a fizzy, soda-pop sweet and crisp mouthfeel. Tons of fresh, sugary raspberry tarts and smooth vanilla cream in the finish. Not much alcohol, but theres no reason to burden these delicate aromas and flavors with any additional components. Overall, this far exceeded my expectations, even with the accompanying hype. A must try for fans of fruit beers and sours alike.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"
4214,"2010-08-26",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2015 Bottle split with pat. Pours a pitch red wine body with no head, no lacing. Aroma is, hands down, the best thing ""fruit"" related ive ever smelt.

4214,"2010-08-22",4.4,"Bottle, LSXI.  As a huge fan of raspberries, Im excited.  Reddish pour with a light pink head.  Very rich, ripe, raspberry aroma.  Flavor is also loaded with juicy raspberries.  This loads in so much rich berry flavor without being syrupy.  Some tartness builds after sipping it and serves to keep it from feeling too sweet.  Im amazed by how simple, yet impressive, this beer is.  It very much succeeds at being a fruit beer thats fruit forward while not tasting like a soda.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"

4214,"2010-08-17",4.3,"Picked this 750 ml. bottle up at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Translucent dull ruby color
that looks pretty good. The head faded away fast, but I can tell this beer is quite carbonated. It smells so 
deliciously fruity. Wow, this sucker is aromatic. Its very pungent and smells of raspberry jelly and puree. Its
not tart smelling whatsoever, but again, its quite aromatic and smells like its going to be a delicious breakfast
beer. Wow, light on the tongue and tart at the end. This is a damn near perfect fruit flavor. The raspberry pop through
and hit my taste buds, but not in a cloying way. The beer is crisp, in terms of carbonation. It seems as though
someone is squeezing fresh raspberry juice on my tongue. Shit, this fucking thing is nice. A perfect tart finish.
Finally, a New Glarus beer that I am thoroughly impressed with.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
4214,"2010-08-11",4.1,"Bottle, thanks for sharing tarheels! Pours bright red with a big reddish white head. Flavor is big, big raspberries (duh) with a sweet and sour taste to it. For such a simple fruit beer, this really blows every other fruit beer away Ive tried.","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"
4214,"2010-08-10",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2011 750mL thanks to my secret Santa (I think). Whoa holy sh!t this is good. I am not a giant fan of the Belgian Red but I know it is hard for NG to come out with a beer that is not stellar. What an outstanding fruit beer that is neither 10%+ nor a lambic.Pours a clear deep purple to ruby with a towering, thick, creamy, slightly pink head that has excellent retention and good lace. Aroma is incredible: fresh raspberries, pithy raspberry, seedy raspberry preserves, really so rich and bright with fresh fruitiness. No candy sugar, no sticky sweetness. Taste is so brilliant: it is malty, creamy, not buttery, with so much fresh raspberry that brings out a naturally tartness that is not framboise sour. No pedio, lacto, acedic acid. No lambic character. But somehow is perfectly balanced between sour berries and sweet malt. Lively, bubbly tart on the palate that finishes super quick making you beg for more. It is not massively complex, but it is a beer that I will crave from now on every day. Destroys all fruit beer. 8/10/2010 8/5/8/5/15=4.1750mL. Pour is perfect- a clear jewel black ruby with a massive pinkish beige head. Huge retention and wispy, gorgeous delicate lace abounds across the raster tulip. Nose is seedy raspberry smoothie. Taste....wow. So much lactic sourness, seedy raspberry, sweet raspberry smoothie. Palate is ultra silky with a long lactic finish. Mild spice and sharp sting. Perfect blend of sweet and sour. Incredible raspberry character. Impossible for any organic lifeform to not thoroughly enjoy this. Whoa. 11/9/11 8/5/9/5/17=4.4","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
4214,"2010-08-10",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2015 Bottle. Pours a mostly clear, deep red with a fine, fizzy, red-white head. Huge aroma of fresh raspberry and some tartness. Very sweet flavor with lots of berries, sour notes and some wood. Light to medium in body with fine, tingly carbonation. Reminiscent, in flavor and partly in mouthfeel, of a nice raspberry ginger ale. Finishes semi-dry with lingering sweetness and some lip-puckering tartness. This is, I believe, the best Fruit Beer I have ever had. (August 2010, score: 4.5)","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
4214,"2010-08-09",3.9,"Picked this up while visiting the brewery right before Darkness Day 2009. Opened this one up while some family visited for the Christmas holiday. Split several ways in wine glasses. 

A - Pours a pink/red/brown color with a very small amount of head. Theres no lacing to speak of and no head retention as well, just a reddish-brown colored liquid.

S - Sweet berries, burnt sugars, and some tart notes as well.

T - Similar to the nose. Berries and sugars with a nice punch-in-the-mouth tart finish. It was too tart for some of my family members, but I could appreciate it.

M - Light, kinda syrupy, good carbonation, tart finish.

D - Great during the holidays and should be split several ways, IMO. Im almost 100% sure theres no way I could finish an entire bottle by myself. Truthfully, I prefer the Wisconsin Belgian Red.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

4214,"2010-07-19",4.5,"Bottle. Pours a magnificent reddish hued clear color with a nice pinkish head.

S: Delicious, tart and sweet raspberries. Thats about it, but thats good enough for me!

T: Delicious, I knocked it down to a 4.5 because the taste isnt quite as complex as the nose... perhaps its limitations of the tongue, but its still excellent. The greatest part is the naturalness to the flavor... Its not candy sweet. Nothing artificial at all. Just fresh raspberries.

M: Medium bodied, with a nice carbonated zip. Not quite champagne, but more so that beer.

O: Superb. A very nice beer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

4214,"2010-07-03",4.0,"Im not normally a fan of fruit beers, but given the high rating and the fact that it was only $8 for 750ml, I considered this a wine well invested. Strong odor of raspberry spritzer is present. Very little foam. Tastes of tangy, sweet, sour, and raspberry. Color is somewhat ominous and rich brown/red.

4214,"2010-06-13",4.2,"Tap at Sugar Maple, Beautiful magenta pour with medium beige head. Aroma of raspberry preserves punches you in the face. A slight pinch of sugar in the nose, but its a complement to the richness of the raspberries. Flavor is again a ton of raspberry preserves with hints of rose petals and yeast. Whats really special is the soft tartness of strawberries and raspberries that stays on the palate prominently but delicately. The tartness adds up with each sip but is never dominant. I dont think I could have more than one, but damn.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","italarican"
4214,"2010-06-11",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2010 Bottle courtesy StFun.  Liquid fruit!!  Sugar sweet raspberry with a medium tart finish (not sour but a wonderfully engineered end-cap to the sweetness).  Tastes like a sunset behind the mountains on a ""day-of-the year"" summer evening while you hold the hand of the one you love.  Amazing. 

2nd half of the bottle the next day - after drinking this s bit more I still find it amazing but really, really sweet so that you only want to drink it in small doses.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
4214,"2010-06-09",4.4,"Pour is at first a light ruby but once the carbonation rises it becomes a deep garnet.  Aroma is intense fresh fruit, raspberry, black cherry, fresh, non medicinal fruit.  Flavor is extreme raspberry fruit with some tannic notes, some yeasty tart notes, but mostly Chock full of raspberry fruit.  DELICIOUS.  rediculiously tasty, more depth then the Belgian Red for me.

4214,"2010-06-09",4.3,"Deep garnet pour with a small bubbly white head. Aroma holds lots of raspberry, golden raisin, other berries, and some touches of cherry and peach. Flavor is heavenly; tons of raspberry, cherry, and just tons of fruitiness that comes at you from every direction, with a bit of musty tartness. Palate is syrupy but light, and has a semi-dry finish. Great stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
4214,"2010-06-09",4.6,"Ruby red pour with a small white head that dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is pure unadulterated raspberry with notes of blackberry, cherry, and light red nectar fruits. Incredible. The flavor is massive raspberry and black cherry. Not overly complex, but utterly amazing. A slight tart note comes in near the middle of the quaff, but by no means would I call this sour. Its like Im eating a raspberry- pure raspberry puree. The palate is just perfect- full, slippery, and delightful. I like this more than the Belgian Red for sure.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

4214,"2010-05-26",4.0,"Had this on friday (thanks brian) and saturday (thanks chris).

A- Body is a vibrant fuchsia-with a bit more red than purple/pink. Bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Head is slightly off-white and retains at a thin collar with minimal lacing left behind in the glass.

S-Smell is dominated by both tart and sweet raspberry but a hint of cranberry is also noticeable in the nose as well as a hint of bready yeast.

T- Taste is pretty much raspberries across the board-the first bottle I had, for some reason, was more tart than the 2nd-The first bottle was left opened before consumption a lot longer than the second which may have something to do with it. The second bottle was on the sweet side but still balanced. A lot of raspberry, a hint of cranberry, and a hint of yeast.

M-Moderate tingly carbonation and medium weight, full body.

4214,"2010-05-05",3.1,"Poured red and brown and mostly clear.  A few little white bubbles constitute the head.  The aroma was tons of sugar, raspberry and earth.

Pours a weird but cool cloudy orange-brown-ruby color with a tiny white head that doesnt last.  Aroma of fresh raspberries, oak, sugar, floral notes, and a hint of hops.  The hops disappear in the flavor, which is heavy on raspberries and oak.  Im surprised, actually, at what an oaky character this has and it complements the rasberries so well.  So fresh, sweet, and tart, for an awesome mouthfeel.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

The back and forth between sweet juicy raspberries and tart juicy raspberries is part of the experience.  As with the nose, there seems to be a slight woody character that makes its presence known.

Dark ruby red with a small pinkish head that leaves a small ring of lacings.

The smell is dominated by genuine raspberry aromas with nicely complementing notes of grass, earth and fruit pits. This brewery really knows how to make fruit beers that smell like fruit.

Lots of fruity sweetness in the flavor, and raspberries all around. A fruity tartness counterweights the sweetness together and develops together with notes of earth and seeds. I might pick up a hint of chocolate as well, but I might be fooling myself. The finish is dry with sweet and tart raspberry notes. The finish is really great, very well done.

Medium body, decent carbonation and a slick dry finish.

A good beer. A raspberry bomb. Very intense, and Im very impressed that a beer with such low ABV can showcase such strong flavors. This one would probably work well as a dessert or coupled with dessert. But I wouldnt want to drink too much of it, one glass is enough.

Since it is hard not comparing this one the Wisconsin Belgian Red, I must say that I preferred this one.

Flavor is similar to the belgian red, its full on raspberry pie, crust and all. Tart raspberry with balancing sweetness. Not sour at all just slightly tart and tangy.

Could go through a bottle or 3 any time.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
4214,"2009-09-14",4.4,"Graciously shared by bhensonb. This fruit beer poured reddish brown with a thin, but pretty pinkish brown head and a delicious raspberry aroma. There is a mellow raspberry flavor that is pleasantly sweet, but not too much, and pleasantly tart, but not too much. There is a definite oak undertone. I could drink this all day. Fantastic.

Aroma is beautiful unadulterated raspberries and a definitive sourness (moreso than expected). Taste is the tartest raspberry taste that you could imagine, with a rather clean raspberry aftertaste reminiscent of the centers of from Sees candies.

Aroma is really strong raspberry, sweet malt, a lightly toasty cereal, rhubarb and some light herbal/grassy notes. Flavor is sweet raspberry, dusty grass, tart raspberry, rhubarb preserves, light wood notes, a little mustiness and raspberry danish. Finish is raspberry, wood and a little acidic. Palate is light to medium bodied, sticky on the lips yet dry on the palate and with a perfect carbonation level.

I have no idea how they got such a vivid and intense aroma into this beer.

I really enjoy the sour funk that is present, but I think it would benefit from being bottle conditioned with some live bacteria.","California, USA","KAME"
4214,"2009-08-11",3.5,"It is somewhat difficult to review to style on something of a catch all style, so I will try my best with this one. One of my few remaining top 100 that I have in my cellar, been sitting on this for a while. New Glarus Belgian red was fantastic, and this one gets similar love. I hope it gets similar love from me. Here we go!

Look is something like a cranberry or grape juice which looks good. I am going to penalize it a bit for the lack of head retention and lacing, but otherwise no problem with the appearance here. 

Scent is, no surprise here, very strong sugary raspberry. A slight bready scent as well. Good, but one dimensional. Its difficult to not judge this against wild ales which would be penalized for not having a bit more to it, but this is exactly what it says it should be.

Taste however is very very good. I dont even like raspberry, but I like this. Not cloyingly sweet or sour, a pleasant (surprise) raspberry burst that has some candy character. Very good but just a little too rich, so rich that I will probably not be able to kill the bottle in one sitting.

Mouth is great, syrupy and bubbly. That is to say its thick, which again would seem off in a wild ale or lambic, but works here.

Overall Im going to come in slightly below the average rating on here, but this is a very good beer. Given the option I am going to opt for its Belgian Red brother every time, but this is still a damn good beer.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"

Enormous clean fresh raspberries and a faint touch of vanilla.  Big and chewy.  Nice tang to it.  Crisp.  Delicious.  Not sure how they do it, but New Glarus manages to do fruit beers so incredibly well.  Clean and distinct, not cloying, not artificial.  Just real and up front.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
4214,"2009-08-06",4.2,"Ill take my raspberry tart as is, please, maybe a little dab of fresh whipped cream. The real thing please; no oil or nitrous added. As for the raspberry tart, only the freshest berries, natural sugars, and homemade crust for me. As my lips wrap around its sweet, succulent, moist, and raspberry-rific body, a playfully tart kiss lingers while warm crust provides a soft chair to lean back upon. Delightfully delicious. As I open my eyes, I realize that I am not partaking of a real raspberry tart, but instead I am supping on the Raspberry Tart from New Glarus Brewing in New Glarus, Washington. Let me elaborate.


She came to me on a quiet, starlit night, deep burnt ruby-red eyes sparkled like a precious gem unfettered and unadulterated by the corruptive touch of mankind. This is made all that more ironic by the fact that this particular beer is a product of mans tender loving machinations, but machinations none-the-less. Her voluptuous bouquet is picked up by the gentle breeze and wafts past me fully aware of their irresistibility. Vanilla bean and pie crust are content to linger in the background, allowing the raspberries and cream to take center stage, as they very well should. There is a finishing playful nip of tartness, a reminder that not all things in life must be saccharine to be enjoyable. There is no resistance or shyness; all that has been thrown to the wind as I greedily sup on her liquid ecstasy. Creamy milky vanilla center with raspberries all around, sour and sweet, resting in a warm pie crust fresh from the oven. There is very little lingering dryness, though I easily thirst for more. If there were ever a perfect dessert beer or sophisticated aperitif, the Raspberry Tart from New Glarus is all one needs. A gentle coating within my mouth blossoms raspberry and cream with a touch of vanilla and crust. She doesnt last long in my glass at all. As I savor the last drop, a whisper of dry wood touches the roof of my mouth, and is gone. All that is left are sweet memories of freshly served raspberry tart.


Im not into really sweet things anymore. I prefer a more artisanal interplay of opposition and cooperation. The Raspberry Tart could be sickenly sweet, but New Glarus understands the artistry of balance. This is the perfect aperitif, after dinner delight, or party highlight to show off to your friends, family and strangers. Grab some champagne flutes, pour, sip, and lose yourself to her sinfully delicious delights. You deserve it.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

From 750 to Bristol Motor Speedway mug...

Deep raspberry red with thick, bready raspberry sherbet-colored head. Cloudy, frothy and nicely carbonated.

Strong aroma of fresh raspberry puree. Natural, perfumy creaminess with slight kick of yeast and carbonation.

Beautiful character of naturally fermented raspberries. Tasty, yeasty presence blends well to make this quite fulfilling. Extremely tangy with moderate carbonation - similar to a champagne-juice mix.

Feels like a creamy version of a sour raspberry soda - well-balanced with no aftertaste; bubbles create interesting zip on finish.

4214,"2009-05-24",4.0,"So I just moved from WI, and I probably took New Glarus for granted.  I had a mini-panic attack when I realized that I hadnt rated this beer before I moved; thanks to Flyer for giving me a second chance at this beer.

Ive had the Belgian Red a few times, and found the quality to be rather hit and miss.  Sometimes Ive liked it, sometimes not so much.  Not sure if this beer has the same consistency issues, but this bottle was terrific.

Color was a dark blood-red color with some light white effervescence.  Aroma was light and fruity, but more tart than sweet.  Flavor was sweet enough to be quite palatable, but again more tart than not.  This tart seemed somehow more true to the fruit than an overly sweet Lindemans frambose ever could be.  Reminded me of a Cantillon frambose.  Flavor was quite good.  Mouthfeel was fairly dry, like a good red wine, but without some of the drying astringency.

Ive not been a fan of New Glarus beers, living in WI gave me the pragmatism to be critical at times rather than to fawn.  But this beer is quite good and Id highly recommend.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Its smooth and creamy on the mouth, but the carbonation bites a bit. While its a little syrupy and heavy, it never seems cloying to me.

Raspberry Tart goes over this rule, an amazing brew!


Pours a vibrant red with a man pink head, great lacing of course and exceptional strength of the foam .. 


Smell is of light berry and fruit juice, subtle...

Pure wonderment in a bottle, bliss in glass, enjoyment at its core, just simply a joy to drink..
The sweetness and mouthfeel are so polite and refined, while still holding there ground, full and respectable, a beer! a good beer!!

4214,"2009-03-15",3.6,"750 ml bottle from discount liquors (milwaukee, wi). Split with my girlfriend. Pours a deep dark largely clear dark reddish hue, a touch of copper, but very burnt red with moderate reddish head that dissipates to a small amount and laces. Aromas are nice aromatic raspberry, light sourness and sweetness, with a natural feel. Initial is lightly tart, nice tannin like feel, moving to mixing tart and sweet natural raspberry, light maltiness, but largely natural raspberry with little yeast or malt. Sweet and tart, light carbonation, creating a balance that prevents cloying qualitiws. Hard to drink a ton of this, but a well executed fruit beer that is considerably different that the typical fare. Nice.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

No one does fruit beers like NG.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"

A crazy amount of fresh raspberries in this, sweet and tart but neither overly done and a nice balance of the two. Very soft on the palate and a little bit of malt behind it. Actually, this is incredibly thick, it tastes like they mashed an insane amount of raspberries in this. Quite tasty. One of the better fruit beers Ive had and a style Im starting to enjoy a little more now than I once did. Thanks pfoxyjohn!  Re-rate.  Awesome.  Insane fresh raspberry aroma and flavor.

4214,"2009-02-08",4.1,"Seven-fiddy ml.  Pours a beautiful dark ruby red with an emasculatingly pink head. Aroma is the freshest, most perfectly ripe example of raspberry youve ever laid your olfactory system on.  Taste is gen-u-wine berry and none of that syrup crap you so often taste in fruit beer.  I couldnt discern the aged hops or get much of the wheat character of the beer over the overpowering taste of berry.  Nicely carbonated and the perfect mouthfeel for the dessert beer this very clearly is.  Splitting a bottle with my wife verged on overdosing on sweet/tart, so would recommend splitting with at least 2 other people unless you regularly mainline liquid jolly ranchers and snort rails of Pixie Stix.","Williamston, Michigan, USA","sleestak"

Tasted of fresh, fresh, fresh -- did I say fresh -- raspberries.  It was amazingly pleasant and didnt taste artificial at all.  You could really taste the authenticity in the quality of the raspberries used.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
4214,"2009-02-06",4.1,"750 ml bottle from Noblesquirrel. Pours a murky-cloudy purple color with a small pink head that soon dissipated. The aroma is big with fresh ripe red raspberries. The flavor is more of the same, raspberries, raspberries and more raspberries. The finish is extraordinarily long with (you guessed it) raspberries. The mouthfeel is medium with a bit of a gritty feel, which actually worked rather well as I can imagine seeds in the mix. Overall: Wonderful concoction with excellent drink-ability, the only negative that I can think of is that its not very tart.  Very tasty--perhaps the perfect desert beer.

4214,"2009-01-13",4.6,"Bottle shared by ajm at the 09er.  Pours a brilliant shade of amber that seems to glow.  Bursting with the aroma of sweet raspberries which carry into the flavor along with notes of cherries and red grapes.  A juicy confection, like something Willy Wonka would serve.  Fairly one note, but that note is rediculously good.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","nbutler11"
4214,"2009-01-12",3.4,"Thanks to Monger for trading me this.  Brilliant nose of sweet raspberries and gorgeous ruby appearance.  The addition of Hallertau hops was a shrewd move as it tinges the fruit flavor with a spicy outline.

4214,"2009-01-04",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2009 Appearance: Pours a murky, pinkish-brown body with a pink-hued, bubbly head.

Smell: Rich, fresh raspberry fruit aroma with a touch of tartness. Maybe a lil bit of heaven added, too.

Taste: Its delish! Raspberry compote with just the perfect balance of pleasing sweetness and tartness. Small tinge of bitter and oak character serve as a reminder that youre not simply feasting on fresh juice. Finishes with a long, lingering fruitiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation.

Drinkability: Unrivaled drinkability. I can say, quite categorically, that New Glarus Raspberry Tart is a phenomenal, incredibly delicious beer. Its a damn shame all fruit beers cant be this good.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The beer pours a beautiful light purple with a large lasting pink head. Aroma is of fresh raspberries, a faint oak, and yeasty funk. The taste is remarkably tart and slightly sour and dominated by the fruit accented by yeast and very light malt. The beer is well rounded and has a sharp initial mouthfeel.

And I took a smell each time I drank.  It was wonderful.  Had a medium mouthfeel with a lot of tiny carbonation bubbles.  The taste of this is very subtle, yet complex.  High raspberry flavor throughout and is very sweet.  I could enjoy this with a nice flourless chocolate cake for dessert and be the happiest person on the planet.  This is a great brew.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
4214,"2008-07-26",4.2,"Pours a beautiful murky raspberry red with a bubbly pink head that lingers for a little while and leaves some sporadic lacing.  I imagine this would be what unfiltered raspberry or cranberry juice looks like.

Wow! wonderful smell on this one as sweet raspberries are the dominant aroma with a hint of tartness as well, possibly from some cherries.

Taste follows the aroma with the obvious raspberry dominance and hint more tartness than in the aroma up front.  There are hints of ""beer"" flavors in there with some wheat if you really look hard, but it’s really all about the raspberries here.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with big carbonation that tickles your tongue with the raspberry tartness and then sticks the sweetness on the palate in the finish.

Much like the Belgian Red, the sweetness is such that drinking this whole bottle is a pretty good feat.  It’s a wonderful beer and New Glarus has shown the ability to nail this style.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Raspberries lightly pucker in your mouth, it’s really like eating raspberries fresh, only in liquid form. The amount of tartness is perfect, not overly acidic like how some raspberry framboise’s can be; sour, without the harsh. Carbonation dances on the tongue, enhancing each flavor. Medium bodied, finishes a bit dry. Incredibly drinkable, if this was in a nonic pint glass, I’d probably end up polishing off the bottle in no time.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

Very deep cherry in colour, creamy and lasting off-white coloured head, good lacing.  The aroma is all raspberries - real raspberries, high sweetness, some jam.  The flavour is of raspberry jam, good tartness, sweet, rich.  Very sweet mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation.  Finishes long with lots of raspberry sweetness.
This is excellent.  Very well balanced, high drinkability, only 4% alc??  Seems like it should be more.  Incredible.  I actually tried a sip of this with a bit of peanut butter, it was amazing.

Hazy (could be from traveling) with a creamy pink head that settles down to a modest crown. Raspberry aroma shoots from the glass instantly filling your nostrils. Raspberry sorbet! In the back is the slightest hint of yeast. Flavor is just layer after layer of every form of raspberry you can imagine. Fresh raspberries, tart raspberries, raspberry coulis and even raspberry meringue. Lacking non-raspberry aromas and flavors. Much sweeter than expected. Almost as if it were back-sweetened. Sweet but thankfully not a fake sweet or raspberry extract. Slight CO2 sting in the back and a bit of yeast. Definitely gets a bit sticky towards the end.

I tried this directly after the Belgian Red which in hindsight was not a great idea because it made me compare the two which is not necessary because they both are so good and have their own positive qualities.  Pours a very thick looking, dark beautiful purple color with a purple head.  The appearance of this rocks.  The aroma on this is spectacular, but again I had to compare it to the Belgian Red which was just a tiny bit better smelling.  Still this was just pure, beautiful raspberry, very, very appetizing aroma.  The mouthfeel on this was ahead of the Belgian Red, just obscenely thick and full bodied which I loved, especially with this beer.  The flavor is not quite as complex or tasty but it still is nice.

4214,"2008-03-05",3.9,"Bottle courtesy of Iowaherkeye.  Thanks!  Pours a rich dense and hazy blood red with a lasting pinkish hued head in a flute-like glass.  Smell is strong sour raspberries and sugar, and somewhat jam like.  Taste is intensely sweet and almost as tart in the mouth.  Very fruity, and drinks more like a thick raspberry soda or alcopop than beer, but still has elements of malted grains behind the huge raspberry sweetness.  Strong flavor, and syrupy, but the mild mouth puckering tartness helped balance it out enough for me to really enjoy a couple glasses.  Still easily one of the sweetest beers Ive had, but I tend not to mind that too much.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

Flavor follows up just as good, with more raspberry and strawberries, and a touch of grassy hay. A bit of grains on the finish, with a superb silky mouth feel.

Im having a love-hate thing with this one, and it fluctuates wildly from one extreme to the other with each sip. I have no idea how to rate it. Its too sweet, to over-the-top fruity; but its so great because the raspberries are so intense; and so on...","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

4214,"2008-01-28",4.0,"750ml bottle. Aroma features undeniably huge amounts of raspberry character, tart, fresh and juicy with background notes of whole grain toast and faint spices. Also looks like a glass of raspberry juice, thoroughly opaque purplish-red in color with a very minimal head. Flavor is also fully raspberry-oriented, starting sweet and sugary and turning quite a bit more tart by the finish, which is long, lingering and still packing an incredible amount of fresh raspberry flavor and much lighter suggestions of wood, wheat citrus and buttery pastry. Mouthfeel is lightly acidic and quite lively with a light body to match. Certainly is about the most overt raspberry character one is likely to find in a beer. Nevertheless, it works quite well due to the interplay of tart and sweet, along with the gently balancing malts.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","hombrepalo"

Aroma is starkly raspberryish. Literally smells exactly like raspberry preserves.

Taste is also dominated by succulent raspberry. It carries a sharp raspberry seed tanginess that serves to balance the sweetness. This tart note is cheek puckering and quite enjoyable. Theres a fleeting tootsie pop note in the finish as well.

Body is quite full, making this an epic dessert beer. The carbonation helps carry the balancing tartness through the palate. A delightful beer thats really easy to drink.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

4214,"2007-11-30",4.0,"25 oz. bottle, consumed on Thanksgiving (11-22-07). Raspberry fills the aroma, not to my surprise. Sugar candy as well. The aroma reminds me of the smell of fresh raspberries from my raspberry patch in the summer with powdered sugar sprinkled on top (Mmm Ill have to try that!). Also smells of sweet baked goods, like raspberry pie or raspberry Pop Tarts. There is a noticeable tanginess to the smell, but the sugary fruit sweetness is most pronounced. Very little traditional beer smell. Pours a ruby dark brown with a moderate amount of thin, short-lasting, pinkish gray/tan head. Appears at first to be opaque, but it is in fact clear. Sour and tangy flavors. Its decidedly on the sour side for a fruit beer. Yes, it tastes of raspberries, but with the sweetness turned down low and the tartness cranked up to 11. In fact, its one of the more sour beers Ive ever had. Rhubarb pie notes. The wheat malt taste is well-hidden but did emerge to a small degree after I got over the initial fruit-sour shock. Medium body. Lively in the palate. The tartness makes it tangy in the throat. Very cool palate sensations, but it is a tad too harsh to earn a perfect palate score. Raspberry Tart is a very different sort of beer. Its quite enjoyable, but its hard for me to rate because it is so different. It smells so sweet and it tastes so sour. Its not at all what I expected, especially in the flavors, but that doesnt mean I didnt like it.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Even perhaps a bit of leather.  A little salty.  A little honey.  Subtle carbonation, soft body.  Not at all watery still.  Big and sweet with huge fruit.  A bit oaky and a bit dusty, slightly tannic.  A little bit of a yogurty bite.  Again, a little leathery.  Not cloying, but still very sweet.  A bit of honey and raspberry tartness in the finish.

4214,"2007-11-10",3.9,"750ml bottle: Pours ruby red with a thick, purple head that fizzles away in minutes.  The aroma is thick with fruit - ranging from Jolly Rancher sweetness to raspberry and cream daquiri creaminess to sour raspberries right from the vine.  Its really quite complex considering it really comes down to one dimension.  My cheeks were automatically inverted as I took my first sip and the intense tartness hit my mouth.  Wow - this is tart and sour and mouth puckering.  My taste buds adjusted (slightly) as I drink more, but this is much more sour that I expected.  The mouthfeel remains creamy.  As the initial blast of tart resides, the wheaty and bready body reveals itself, briefly, until the sourness hits the back of the tongue on the way down.  The finish leaves a wider variety of fruit notes on the tongue - I am getting strawberry and cherry in addition to the razz.  This is interesting stuff - definitely for sipping and would be great with a cheesecake or other super sweet dessert.  Today, a really sharp cheddar is helping to cut through the intense tartness nicely.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

4214,"2007-09-23",4.3,"Pours a very cool dark ruby red with a pink tinged one finger head. The head fades fairly quickly to a thin swirling cap and ring, leaving behind a thin wispy lace.

Smell; theres a huge tart raspberry aroma, which is no surprise, but theres also a bit of a sweet sugary presence underneath that. Otherwise theres not much else going on in the aroma department.

Taste; as with the nose, and to be expected, theres big tart raspberry flavor. A little bit of some sweetness come through the tartness, as well as a mild hint of some caramel and cherries. The sweet and tart flavors seem to flow back and forth very nicely, and make this probably the best fruit beer that Ive had so far.

Mouthfeel is full bodied, and leaves a thick coating in my mouth after each sip, and the drinkability is really good, as the beer is just disappearing before my eyes.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

In a way it is very one-dimensional focussing sorely on raspberries but on the other hand it feels so complete and complex.  In fact it is so focussed on raspberries that it is hard to write a long text to describe it.  And Im not the type of guy who will write a long rating just for the sake of writing a long rating.

I dont think they could have nailed it any better for the style. I poured a flute for the wife as well to celebrate the night. It was wasted on her as she just couldnt handle the taste. Very surprising and disapointing, but what are you going to do? For a woman thats been fed Surly Furious, Hop Slam and Stone Ruination, youd think she would appreciate the tartness for what it is.

4214,"2007-07-07",3.9,"Glub glub glub, out it comes, slowly. Dark red body, obviously thick and sticky as soon as it hits the glass and sticks to whatever surface it touches. A very small off-white head with orange and pink hues fades to a ring of fat bubbles nearly instantaneously. The aroma is as close to raspberry preserves as the real thing. No hints of alcohol, no medicinal notes, just big, fat, exploding raspberries. The flavor is incredibly sweet and very lightly tart, with no bitterness and a hint of acidity. The finish is lightly tart, all raspberry and modest in length for such powerful beginnings. The mouthfeel is absurdly thick and certainly unfiltered, leaving bits of raspberry seeds stuck between the teeth. Massive full body, light fizzy carbonation.

The carbonation is champagne-like and tickles your nose as you contemplate the aroma. This smells like youve picked up a handful of fresh raspberries and crushed them in your fist-- fresh, sour, juicy. Pure raspberry juiciness dominates the palate, but it is far from one-dimensional. Several key elements elevate this beer into something unique and special-- a fresh sour-tartness that perfectly balances the fruit juice sweetness; an ephemeral stemmy-leafy quality that imparts both an earthiness and a bitterness that keep this tasting real and not candyish, and most importantly the delicate and lively carbonation keeps it alive on the tongue. This style is hit-and-miss for me, but this is definitely among the finest fruit beers I have ever had, and one that is worth seeking out.

Beautiful aroma of freshly picked raspberries, over-ripe and gushing with juice.  Sweet, but authentic and has a subtle seed-like herbal woody quality to it thats quite nice.  Rich raspberries, but not a whole lot of other dimensions.  Medium bodied, sparkling mouthfeel.  Not sticky or cloying, but definitely too sweet for my palate, and gives this beer a bit of a one-dimensional quality.  Lots of sweet raspberries at first, quite delicious, and then the flavors fade to the promise of some cidery funk.  A little bit of woody, funky spice, but not dry enough to enhance this quality fully.  The finish actually reminds me quite a bit of the unplugged enigma, without the raspberry residue of course.  Delicious raspberry aroma and flavor, but the palate could be a bit dryer and funkier to help develop more complexity.  Fantastic beer, but too sweet for my tastes to give a higher overall score.

Even the seeds which add a sort of woodiness that is usually missing from syrup-based beers, is present here.  Sweet, fruity flavour with loads of juicy raspberry character, a touch of tartness that really sets off the fruitiness of the beer.  Palate is quite good with the barest hint of maltiness serving as a backing note to the intense fruitiness.  Perhaps the least beer-like beer Ive had to date, reminding me more of some of the raspberry wines and ports that Ive had before.

4214,"2007-03-22",3.8,"750 ml bottle:  Pours w/ a thin but lasting pink head and a garnet colored body.  Initial aroma is of raspberries (go figure), sweaty leather, light wisps of cat box, and a bit of bready malt.  As it warms the malt sort of takes over but still remains a bit sour in the aroma.  Raspberries still assertive, but not as strong.  Balanced to tart initially, but it is sweet/tart as it warms slightly.  Sweetness up front, tart at the finish and into the aftertaste.  Some earthy leathery flavors as well as a faint wheat malt.  Lightly acidic, mouthpuckering tartness at first which you can actually feel, but very smooth and medium bodied. Lighter medium carbonation rounds out the m/f.  Very nice beer for 4% ABV.  Great complexities from the fermentation and not over powering on the raspberries.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

1. I am normally not super fond of fruit beers in general.  
2. I dont like raspberries. 
3. I purchased this for my wife who loves the Belgian Red. 

That said, I thought this was not bad.  Definitely tart raspberry aroma.  Color is a violet/red with minimal head (similar to Belgian Red in that way).  That is the main flavor as well.  A dessert beer that I can appreciate, just not necessarily my cup of tea.  Both my wife and I liked the Belgian Red slightly better, but thought this was pretty decent.  Good to know if Im ever in Wisconsin, I can pick up a beer that she enjoys.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

The flavor is more of that raspberry pie filling - thich and potently full of raspberry and more raspberry. The raspberry flavor is both tart and sweet, both fresh and baked, and absolutely natural. Perhaps its my imagination, perhaps its the color, but I also taste just a hint of beet in there too.

This is a fantastic fruit beer, it is sweet and sour and really evokes rasberries almost better than the fruit itself.  Ive been really excited to try this beer for a a while, and it tastes great.  While we were drinking this someone said it tasted like flinstones vitatmins, and really it sort of does, it has a taste that resembles that but it is not chalky or concentrated in any way, it is a really fantastic brew that I feel lucky to have had.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

4214,"2007-01-10",4.1,"First of all, a big thanks to mwsf for this bottle.  Massive raspberry flavor.  Pretty tart as well.  A little chocolate.  Clearly a hell of a lot of fresh raspberries are used in this.  Its sweet and with a delicate sourness.  Similar to a flemish sour, but with a ton of fruit.  I enjoy it until the pure raspberry flavor in the finish.

4214,"2007-01-05",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 A lot of sweet beers, like well made framboises and krieks, are exceptional at capturing the natural flavor of the fruit they represent.  Despite a very meticulous protocol of processing, thermal shock and movement they end up tasting like pure nectar bleeding straight from natures dulcet vines.  The lesser variants tend to taste like they were made from syrup spewed out from an industrial complex, smokestack and all.  I never knew until now that there could be mediation between these two ideas.  New Glarus Raspberry Tart has shown me the way.  As I peer down into the glass of this luxurious drink I see a roseate head that could easily be misconstrued for a fancy strawberry cake.  Meanwhile the body of the beer is murky and quiet with contentment, deep with passion, and as dark red as cardiac muscle.  It sits with a silent Bacchanalian joy that whispers alluring, sweet and aromatic poetry from its top.  The smell instantly transports you to a sunny, verdant farm where youre jarring raspberry preservatives in their rawest form  seeds and all.  The sweet, fruity sugar packs the nose all the way to the sinuses, almost shoving raw natural fructose down your throat before your lips have had a chance to satiate themselves.  The taste is matured, and not as bitter as the more organic fruit beers tend to be.  Its more processed, but only insofar as a compact and colorful tart or an immaculate cake is processed.  Its not industrial, but artisanal, being fashioned from a craftmans hands rather than a moving line of metal hooks and blades.  It feels capacious with expression, boundless but narrowed in its type.  It feels a shame to categorize this beer into any one identity, because at the first sip it feels like it transcends names and identities.  It merely becomes fruit.  At least, thats all that was on my mind.  Pear and apple join the flavorful fray a bit later, and with a bit more degrees (Fahrenheit) acting on the beer a bit of confectioners sugar comes to play.  With all these sugary flavors it might seem a bit much.  It really pushes the boundaries, but New Glarus Raspberry Tart stays a hair short from being cloyingly sweet.  That doesnt mean you should go paring it with savory dishes like filet mignon or salmon.  Its simply moderate enough that it wont crystallize your blood with excess sugar granules.  Take it for what it is  a very sweet, still fruity and opulent beer fit for richness.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
4214,"2007-01-02",4.2,"From trade with brewblackhole. Poured a deep dark red. The head was medium body and pink. The aroma spelled strongly of raspberry, very tart, sweet, and some spice.

Either way I am a resident of wisconsin so it is my duty to review new glarus.

4214,"2006-12-29",4.3,"Deep garnet/red in color, topped with a first class pink raspberry mousse.  Aroma of raspberry, vanilla and oak, like the worlds next award winning ice cream that will astonish and captivate the audience on Rachel Ray or Oprah.  Deep in flavor with lemon, orange, and a honey-oak middle admist the raspberry goodness that frames it all.  Like Belgian Red, it tastes irresistably fresh, and it just barely can be classified as beer, even as one that is infinitely more sweet and sour than it is bitter or robust.  Still, for me, it reaches for transcendence and nearly gets there.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4214,"2006-12-27",4.1,"Rapidly succeeding the tremendous effort New Glarus named Enigma, Raspberry Tart was this time where all my long-standing expectations of the brewery lay. It might be useful to remind of my near fanaticism for raspberries, the zeal those tiny plump fruits muster in me, seemingly disproportionate but merely the product of countless beautiful memories. A passionate scarlet juice draped in fizzy pink cloth reflects liquidly the quiddity of the fruit. Little more can be said of the nose which seems to capture in a concentrated form the essence of raspberries, decupling every nuance and raising the soul to a veritable apotheosis. Sugary marshmallow, cherry, grape and oak add to the experience, suggesting a certain depth while raspberry continues to dominate the bouquet. The sumptuous flavor is assumed and appears in its natural form enhanced by sticky grape juice, fig, caramel and a slight sourness. What worries me is that New Glarus has simply reproduced my mothers raspberry jelly in liquid form. Not that its facile, but perhaps... unnecessary. I need a beer that reconcile its status as a beer with the bully raspberries can be. Leave the quintessence to my tartines, I need something with complexity and balance that takes advantage of beer as medium.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

This brew will definately not appeal to everyone.  Strange fruit in the middle and then ends in delicious red raspberries.  I dont really detect any sourness like other are claiming.

UPDATE (12/31/2006 and 1/01/2007):  HAPPY NEW YEAR!  What better way to celebrate the New Year than with my wife and a bottle of New Glarus Raspberry Tart?!  Well, the ball has dropped in NYC, so now its offically 2007 here! -- 

New Glarus Raspberry Tart pours a hazy reddish plum color with a brownish tinge to the hue.  The frothy crown is pink in color a leaves an interesting speckled lacing pattern.  This beer has a wonderful fresh raspberry aroma.  The flavor is huge and is dominated by fresh raspberries.  It has a great sweet/tart taste as well (neither dominate too much) with a bit of sourness just before the juicy finish.  This beer is rich and smooth on the palate.  Overall this is another wonderful marriage of fruit and beer by New Glarus (their Belgian Red is also an amazing fruit beer).  This beer was worth the drive to Wisconsin to get a couple of bottles!   My orginal rating stands, but I think that the New Glarus Belgian Red might be just a bit better...

Wonderful texture in the mouth as the oak and raspberries continue to waltz around the palate.  Very similar to the belgian red, but a bit more tart.  Very good.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

Once it hit the glass, the raspberry aroma was even more intense and wonderfully enjoyable.  No surprise, the flavor was almost all about the raspberry.  Very, very sweet, but for me, not in a bad way.  There is a bit of sourness that quite nicely balances out some of the sweetness.  Very drinkable.  I need to get some more!","Harleysville, Pennsylvania, USA","biggcb"

There is definitely tartness, but a creamy sweetness as well.  Medium / full body that is thick and creamy with only a little carbonation at the end, but that is all it needs.  The taste has lots of raspberry goodness that starts of creamy, smooth and rich with some tartness and slightly bitter.  The finish gets a little spicy.  It gets more crisp and taste almost like a raspberry pie.  I was expecting the little seeds from the raspberries to get stuck in my teeth.  A fantastic fruit beer.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

25.4 oz bottle purchased in March of 2008 at Chicones in Hudson, Wisconsin.  Looking forward to the re-rate on this one.  Pour is hazy pinkish red with a 1 inch pink head. Nice lacing. Very pretty in the glass. Aroma is amazingly like fresh raspberries.  Really good, high quality, raspberries.  Sweet, tart, everything a raspberry should be.  Taste is even more amazingly raspberry.  This is the most similar to the actual fruit beverage I have ever consumed.  Remarkable.  As it warms a bit in the glass, you can get the faintest hint of the yeast, really the only indication this is not just raspberry juice.  Palate is full and mouth coating.  This was good, and outstandingly well made.  I really wish I would have had some vanilla ice cream or choclate cake with this.  I will use this new rating.  8,5,7,4,15 (3.9).

Aromas of fresh cleaned, wet raspberries in bowl, Fruity sweet with a light tartness.

Good, fizzy carbonation and a berry crisp, tart with some dryness, smooth light-medium bodied mouthfeel.

Delicious raspberries taste, dry and juicy with a perfect balance between the sweetness and the tartness, one does not overwhelm the other, a very grain maltness meshed with a light alcohol warmth, and a dry raspberry finish.

Fresh raspberries that have been squashed up in a bowl a slammed in your face like you were the brunt of some Three Stooges scene.

4214,"2006-09-08",3.4,"25 oz bottle, via 1FastSTi.  Pours a slightly cloudy dark garnet colored body under a fizzy pink tinged head that faded to a thin ring.  Aroma is full of sweet and tart syrupy raspberries.  A little woodiness and yeast as well, but they barely make it past the raspberry.  Flavor is quite tart and slightly acidic yet finishes quite sweet and syrupy.  The raspberry tastes a little artifically over-the-top.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy in texture with light fizzy carbonation that helped cut through the syrupyness a little.  Overall, this is pretty decent, but not up to par with its big brother Belgian Red.  Maybe Im being unfair to this beer, because I know in my mind Im comparing it against Belgian Red, no matter how objective Im trying to be.  Oh well, it just comes across to me as too much syrupy fruit and lacking in complexity.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Many thanks to Monger for the trade!  Cloudy maroon appearance with a small light-pink head; large-bubble formation.  Huge amount of fresh raspberries in the nose, slightest suggestion of tartness.  Upfront tartness in the palate, full mouthfeel, layers and layers of raspberry goodness; oak toastiness appears almost imperceptibly at the finish - raspberries dominate otherwise.

Some creamy vanilla in the middle.  Finishes a bit dry with plenty of sour raspberry and green apple tartness.

The color was a great red purple that reminded me of grape juice I drank when I was a kid.  The mouthfeel and flavors are just way too sweet and syrupy for me to really enjoy this one.

The mouthfeel is what I really didnt care for in this one. It is too thick and heavy. It has the mouthfeel of a milkshake.

Still, too much raspberry and somewhat thick and sticky. Poured a deep burgundy color with a thin pink colored head and some lacing. Mouthfeel was moderately bodied to thick and somewhat sticky.

Flavor is very very sweet upfront but very inviting for you to keep drinking more and more.  The sweetness slowly turns to tartness in the end.

This poured like something from my smoothie maker. Gloppy fruit juice thick with a rich red/raspberry color and even had a diminishing, thumb thick, tan head. Fore is a blast of sweet raspberry and as that fades a kind of grainy oatmeal/wheat maltiness appears that tastes a bit of oatmeal cakes and malt powder. The overall effect is like a fruitfilled cake with  malt powder sprinkled on it. This is so fantastic tasting that it is a little hard to believe. While the raspberry flavors are amazing what turly endears me toward the beer is the far aftertaste which is so malty and oat/wheat cake wholesome that it make me feels like a little kid trying a sweet treat for the first time.

Mouthfeel is lightly acidic and quite lively with a light body to match.  Certainly is about the most overt raspberry character one is likely to find in a beer.

It was the perfect beer to accompany the lovely meal that the girl I am dating prepared. We sat down to chopped grilled chicken breast atop a fresh arugula salad with cranberries and pears. The dressing is what pulled the beer and food together; a fresh balsamic and raspberry vinaigrette.  
The beer poured a somewhat muddy crimson / brune body with edges of amber. The head was a dirty pink hue and didnt last long, although the lacing did. The aroma was marvelous! Some oak and tart balsamic vinegar suggestions sit amidst the sweet yet lightly bitter raspberry. There is a nice malt complexity, toffee, biscuit, and piecrust. It all pulls together so nicely!

Not a visually attractive beer. Lots of sediment makes this relatively light-colored beer completely opaque; looks like red Kool-Aid made with mud water. Lots of natural carbonation forms a dark pink, tightly packed, very persistent head. Aroma is predominatly sour tart berries and little else. The label isnt joking about the ""tart"" bit -- this stuff is unrepentently so. But not unpleasantly so; thankfully, theres enough sweetness to keep it from being overbearing.  So many fruit beers end up with a contrived ""beer with fruit thrown in"" character. New Glarus Raspberry suffers no such deficiency. The fruit aspect is extremely well-integrated like this was always meant to be a fruit beer from beginning to end. The relatively low 3.9 rating I gave is in part because of a low ""appearance"" rating and does not do justice to how truly well-crafted and enjoyable this beer is.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Carbonation is simply perfect, and the palate overall great; creamy, thick, and a little froth.  Watch out, sweetness and richness with get to you after awhile.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","Gurst"
4214,"2005-06-30",4.4,"Pours a deep ruby red. Very pretty pour, but the layer of pink-tinged tan head is kind of skimpy. I wouldnt complain, but it seems like this is generally expected to be a highly carbonated style. (Also, every thing else was so good, I felt like I had to complain about something.) The aroma is stunningly fragrant. Raspberries, vanilla, fruity sourness, spice, muskiness, and a bit of lightly toasted wheat. Mmmm. So delicious. An overwhelming slap of flavor, like stepping out of a building into a hurricane. Which comes first here, the incredibly tart, mouth puckering sourness, or the rush of sweet raspberry jam? I sure cant tell, but my mouth is digging the chaos. This is wonderful beer. Bravo to the cheeky brewers of New Glarus! They have gone after a challenging, almost Baroque style here, and the results are remarkable. One small caveat. I think serving it cool, and not  ""very cold"" as the label suggests, will shows off the sourness of this beer to its best advantage.

This one doesnt present the complexity of their Belgian Red (cherry), but instead is more straight to the point of raspberry flavor.

Flavor is pretty much a mix of 4/5 raspberry and 1/5 malt, and hops kick in rather surprisingly on the finish.

Poured a deep reddish purple with minimal head, probably because it was served cold (as recommended on the bottle).  Aroma is tart raspberry jam.  Taste is reminiscent of Belgian Red, with a strong acidic tartness nestling against the flavor of sweet fresh raspberries.  The taste is a little thicker and not quite as light and refresing as Belgian Red, but this is truly a world class beer.

The aroma is tart raspberry jam. The flavor is tart raspberry pretty much the whole way through and has a tart, flavorful aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was nice. It reminds me a lot of the Bonny Doon Framboise. This is a very good beer, but, unlike their Apple Ale, none of the beer notes seem to really come through, this is certainly not a bad thing, just making an observation.  My wife and I split the bottle during and after diner. She is not a beer lover (except for stouts?) but she really enjoyed this.

Additional notes. I have had this beer numerous times and I love it everytime. The smell is delightful, the raspberry is ever present and presented in all its glory, the carbonation level leads to a full mouthfeel and the slight sweet/tart finish makes it easy to drink.

4214,"2004-12-03",3.9,"Thanks tannertavernboys for this fruity goodness. Pours a deep russet violet with a reddish head. Aromas of some malts but mostly just raspberries. No hops anywhere. Very sweet with a tartness to balance it out. Only complaints are that there is no bretta and this hardly resembles beer at all. Even considering that, this was very enjoyable.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"
4214,"2004-12-01",3.0,"Thanks to footbalm for this bottle (among many wonderful others).  Great pour to it, thick, deep red raspberry appearance, unfiltered, with a small creamy beige-white head.  Aroma of succulent sweet raspberries, pulpy, juicy and fresh.  Flavor is tremendously full of raspberries.  Like fresh raspberry jam, juice and whole berries.  Sugary, thick and nearly full bodied.  In the middle you get a bit of fruity acid notes, and some lactic notes, providing an ever so brief amount of relief from the heavy sweetness, and the finish shows some light wheat notes, more in texture than actual flavor.  Very easy to compare to Lindemans, yet I found the underlying lambic qualities to be much fewer and farther between in this brew.  There was a decent carbonation, a bit of yeast notes here and there, but overall, it was just pure fatiguing raspberry.  Way too sweet and one-dimensional.  I was really hoping for more beer quality in this and less fruit dominance.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Raspberries dominate, but there are hints of blackberry, malt, yeast and a bit of hop bitterness along with the tartness of the berries.  Definitely want to drink this one cold because it got a bit cloying as it warmed.  Medium body and gentle, tickling carbonation.

Flavor is divinely sweet, never even approaching chemical or artificial.  Liquid divinity, true ambrosia.  I think this really is a dessert beer and should be shared with many friends because 750ml is waayyy more than I can drink of this very sweet, palate-taxing brew.

This beer is a huge success, as in they accomplished everything that they were hoping to do. Raspberries were really the only thing cohesive in this brew. The malt character? Ha! None. The hop character? Ha, once again! Obviously with the use of aged Hallertau, they didnt want any hop flavor to come through. The raspberries though were just simply utterly delicious and consumed my entire mouth. The tartness balanced the sweetness of the raspberries perfectly. I didnt find this beer cloying at all.

Snap! Fssh...and out wafts the incredible raspberry aroma! Lets get that in a glass and up to my lips, pronto!
Color pours out a devilishly dark, bloody red, with a head that starts fine, but swiftly dissipates. I search for associations with appearance and can only come up with candies, desserts, pies, liqueurs...all things sweet, delicious, and fruity!
Up in the nose, BAM! Raspberry Sorbet! Gorgeous! I used to work in an ice cream factory, and relished the time spent with fruit purees, before blending and freezing. This is exactly like that.
I dont even care if I never get to drink it, just to smell this all day long would be heaven!
A highly charged pounce upon the palate at first sip, a bracket of hops, a rush of carbonation. 
So much lip-smacking going on throughout the drink...ooo,tart! oo, tart!, but still sweet and delicious.
Texture: phenomenal, body:full, finish: eternal!This beer has a flavor that never lags, or sags, or forgets its business.
My only caveats are that the tart flavor can be too much at times, and though quite a delight, this is strictly a special occasion ale, best enjoyed after a perfect meal, among several friends, with plenty of time to loll back and marvel at the splendor!

Aroma is like raspberry jam or pancake syrup.  Almost too strong.  Very sweet with a bit of woody oak.  First impression is the tart, dry very bold ras flavor. A quite sharp astringent tang, as the flavor fades.  The long term finish quickly dissipates with not much of a reminder of what just happened.  The ABV is nearly imperceptable and the dry finish is clean with a hint of he oak barrels trying to hang on.  As it warms a bit the acidity and the oak comes through more.

The beer is definitely sweet.  It has a full fruity flavor and an almost thick body from the residual sugars that are left behind.  It is quite tart in the finish, though it could perhaps use a bit more to balance the syrupy sweetness.  I also get a bit of raspberry skin tannin in the finish.

There is no doubting the raspberry nature of this concoction. In fact, that is about all you can taste. The color is dark ruby red and looks very much like a wine. The aroma is raspberry and sweetness. The flavor, however, is quite sour (not shit its called ""tart"") but not puckeringly so. Tastes like an unripe raspberry. This drink has a big reputation.

Gorgeous clear deep garnet color (except late when I swirled in the yeast in glass #4).  Full fruit raspberries (natch)and blackberries and citrus (grapefruit and orange). Sharp and acidic. Nothing late to mellow the bite. I would love to rate this higher, but lacks the complexity of its Belgian counterparts.  This may be a byproduct of its low alcohol.

The flavor is much more fruity than sweet (although, after the initial tartness, quite sweet) and with a much better aroma.  An excellent fruit beer.  The key, as with the Belgian Red, is that the base beer is good on its own.","California, USA","tomxcs"

Very sweet, yet moderately tart, too.  A bit too much for me, as I could only handle one 4oz glass of this.  But you've got to respect the artistry and craftsmanship.  Most fruit beers suffer from a lack of ingredients, but this beer has an embarrassment of fruit riches.  Very thick not beerlike in the least.

You can't really classify it in the conventional categories-since its neither belgian in character and too fruit dominated to be a ""raspberry-wheat"" type thing.  But it is simply marvelous.

Im truly impressed, seduced, intrigued. Mostly sweet aroma, tempting, you cant tire of it, you cant get your nose out of that glass. I love raspberries and Im all set for the cruise. This starts with a pure raspberries attack, will your defenses hold? You bet, keep them coming, hell yeah, I want more. After a few sniffs, you start to grasp the necessary subtlety for a perfect 10 in the aroma department. Vanilla accompanies these stellar fresh fruits and who says vanilla often says woody touch which is also true here. First beer that makes me say: ""I know what Im smelling for breakfast tomorrow"". People are not kidding when they say you taste the seeds, you almost feel them between your teeths. Marvellously crafted fruit beer, perhaps even better than a personal favorite: Quelque Chose. I cant believe a beer to be so full-flavoured at 4% ABV. Unique creation which can only be rivalled by New Glarus Belgian Red and as MartinT points out, once youre there, its really only a matter of preferring cherries over raspberries or vice-versa. On parallel, I personally prefered the raspberry tart which seems to have more acidity (although it still could have used a bit more imo). This is the best single focus on one flavor Ive encountered in my young life, this extreme sweetness never appears cloying, nor syrupy nor fake. Lots of stuff going on, eminently complex, crisp and contemplative. Superb mouth-filling body with enough carbonation to detract from the never cloying sweetness.

4214,"2003-06-24",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2004 Hello raspberries, welcome to my mouth. Wow, what a nice little refresher of raspberry surprise. Another 1pint 9oz fancy green bottle from New Glarus with the neck dipped in red wax, very cool, unique, classy, and makes for a good conversational piece.
Color of this pours out of dark ruby red and settles to be very opaque but glowing deep of rich raspberry colors. No head or lace produced, not all that necessary, but a slight disappointment. 
Quite a bouquet of prefumey raspberry joy, both red and black varieties, very dark and deep, super lucsious and just plain fresh like just picked from the bushes. Taste is just as lusciously fresh, a raspberry delight, I detect more black raspberries then red. Moderately tart and sweet, souring a bit, taken in fairly easily but the sour can get the lips a puckering if you drink to much to fast or at once. Its a sipper to settle down with, makes for a great dessert or capper. Feel is medium with lots of tartness in front and goes tangy and sweetly smooth to a raspberry drying much like the fruit itself would do, just take out those tiny yellow seeds that get stuck in your teeth, which they've already done for you here, so your set.

4214,"2003-06-08",4.5,"This is one for the lambic lovers.  It shares many characteristics with the Belgian Red, but I like this one more, perhaps because it is less tart.  The aroma is so huge and sweet, like a barrel of fresh-picked raspberries.  My mouth waters out of control every time I smell it.  The appearance is a perfectly clear, dark red, like a fine red wine, and it has a small, dark pink/light purple head - ""spread this on toast?"" - most certainly, it tastes like liquid raspberry preserves - extremely sweet, with just a tiny bit of tartness to cut it - the tartness lingers into the finish, getting your tongue ready for another wonderfully sweet sip - there is something about this that leaves a slightly thick feeling on the tongue as the beer is swallowed, which makes you wonder if you actually are eating raspberries - this is not for everyone, but in my opinion it is something worth seeking out and savoring.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4214,"2003-05-07",2.6,"OK, a couple of disclaimers seem called for.  First, my palate is rusty as hell.  I haven't had a batch of new brews like this in a very long time.  Second, I'm habitually baised against fruit beers, most of which I can't stand, though I'm not above my own experimentations in home brewed fruitiness.  That said, this stuff rubbed me the wrong way - I was already thinking the Norski might be too sweet and this one rages with sweetness.  And what tries to rein this outageous power in is not anything significantly beery (i.e. hops), but rather the natural, beautiful tartness of rasberries.  What seems to have happened is that the significant malt (it does have a good round feel) causes a sweet accentuated by the berries.  I admire the freshness and quality of the ingredients, but what they add up to is not a beer I like much.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"

4214,"2003-04-16",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2004 Very very nice--the kind of beer my wife loves to share with me.  I loved the wax on the bottle neck and top--nice touch.  Pours attractively with a vibrant raspberry-red head, just bursting with aroma.  So fresh, so authentic.  Perhaps a hint of raspberry sherbert there, but mostly raspberry puree.  The flavor...more of the same!  There are moments when it reminds you that it is a beer, but mostly this is an easy-drinking wine cooler / kool aid beverage.  The initial sip (on a clean palate) struck at the jaw with a jolt of sour, but after that the ""tart"" was more in name than in palate--or perhaps, given the sweetness, a raspberry tart (i.e. pie-like dessert).

4214,"2003-03-10",4.1,"Raspberry, Raspberry, Raspbeery. Beautiful red coloring and a nose that lets you know that sweetness is what this guy is all about. Overiped raspberries in the nose and the palate. Enjoy with a nice chocolate cake.","Escondido, California, USA","Dougal"
4214,"2003-03-09",4.2,"This a truly special brew if you ask me. Pours a beautiful glowing red with a nose like a fresh raspberry danish. Sweet but not cloying. Full lush raspberry flavor with a slight acidity coming through in the middle. Another of the highlights from the fest.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
4214,"2003-03-09",4.3,"Dark red color. Small head. Aroma is raspberry and malts. A big bold raspberry flavor. Malty and slightly sweet. The raspberry flavor predominates this beer. Still beer like, despite all the fruit flavor. As usual with New Glarus its very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
4214,"2003-03-09",3.7,"Jcalabre called the description spot on.  Every thing about this brew is rasberries that jsut happened to be brewed.  Very sweet and full of Rasberry jam, fresh rasberries, rasberry pie filling, and a little pie crust.  Its more of a dessert than anything, would love to find a bottle to try some cooking with.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
4214,"2003-03-08",4.2,"It looked like a glass of cloudy merlot. Huge nose & flavor of... Raspberries. These guys did this one right. It's not a beer w/ some raspberries thrown in. It's the sweet/tart taste of raspberries, that happens to be a beer. Great job.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
4214,"2003-02-19",3.6,"that color..its just dark evil evil red..with a thin purple halo of head..all tart raspberries in the aroma..with maybe a hint of hops..and lots of anticipation of sweetness..nice raspberry jam flavors..with a nice tartness noticed on the top of the mouth..nice dry vinous ending..the beer is lost in all the fruitiness though...so.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
4214,"2003-02-14",3.8,"Well, the name doesn't lie.  It tastes like raspberries, and it is tart.  The full bodied texture makes this highly drinkable.  It's a lively fizz brew that finishes dry.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
4214,"2003-02-10",3.9,"I'm trying to be fair to a beer with an incredible level of sweetness that I was not prepared for. Overall, pretty good for what it is. Recommended with some nice chocolates or a piece of cheesecake.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
4214,"2003-02-10",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2003 Yes it has Raspberries, yes it is tart, but what scores it big marks is the remarkable freshness and drinkability of this stuff.  Slightly musty notes in the nose beneath the huge fresh berries.  Lively carbonation and tiny alcohol content. Very nice, nearly as good as the Belgian Red (Cherry).","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
4214,"2003-01-23",3.6,"1/1/03. My welcome home beer from South America. Strong raspberry aroma. Opaque, dark reddish color with a cranberry colored head that rapidly faded. Started off very sweet then got tart. Strong raspberry flavor. Lightly carbonated. I enjoyed it but wished that there was more going on with the flavor.","San Diego, California, USA","rodolito"

4214,"2003-01-03",4.1,"Wow!  The only major difference between this and the cherry offering is the two fruits.  The cherry brings a slight sourness that is pleasing.  This beer is sweet, but not unpleasantly so, and makes you forget every bad raspberry beer you have ever had.","Dallas, Texas, USA","dukefan"
4214,"2002-12-25",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2007 Pours a unique color that combines orange and purple, with a nice reddish head that leaves good lacing. Huge berry aroma.

4214,"2002-10-24",3.9,"Deep, deep red.  Not much head, but tons of lacing.  Obviously, raspberry dominates throughout.  Starts a bit sour, turns sweet and moves back to sour in the finish.  The body is nice--not too thick, not too thin.  Lovely aroma, nice flavor, and something significantly different.  I definitely enjoyed it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
4214,"2002-10-22",3.1,"This is beer?  Its very fruity.  The only bitterness (in a grassy, meady way) is a quick rush at the very beginning of a sip, and unfortunately this is unpleasant.  The raspberry quickly takes over though and the result is a syrupy alcoholic beverage.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","mjmurphy2"
4214,"2002-10-20",4.1,"Very deep ruby/garnett hue.  Pinkish tan head sticks around for a while.  Floral fruity tons of raspberry in the nose.  Starts off slightly sweet, medium bodied, sourness kicks in on the finish.  Tons of raspberry, very pleasant, very drinkable.

4214,"2002-10-01",2.8,"Great characteristics in this one, smell, look, and appearence in the champagne flute.  Just couldnt get to like the taste of it.  Doesnt mean it is bad just dont seem to be able to get a enjoyable experience in drinking this one.  Ended up watching my guests drink the rest of the bottle while I went back to the Spotted Cow ale.","Sharon, Wisconsin, USA","awaller05"
4214,"2002-08-16",3.9,"Wonderfully tart.  Looks like grape juice but has a wonderful mix of malt and fruit.  Not much hop flavor, but the tartness makes up for any lost bitterness.  A silky smooth body warms the palate as it goes down.  A great breakfast beer.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4214,"2002-08-10",3.2,"I love raspberry and I like fruit beers. This is high quality raspberry, pretty darn sugary, and in only a marginal way was it beery. I want more beer in my fruit beer (Dark Horse Tres Bluberry Stout is an excellent example, as is Quelque Chose). Perhaps a bit of Hallertau emerges as it warms. Still yummy. And very berry. Just not beery.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
4214,"2002-06-06",3.9,"Very good taste a real beer unlike those malt womens drink, smell isnt too strong but good its very great beer, if your looking for good flavor this beats everyother flavored beer ive ever had.","Seattle, Washington, USA","iggysam2000"

4214,"2002-05-24",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2004 Pours with a muddy red raspberry color with admirable head retention.  The aroma embodies overwhelmingly ripe raspberry jam.  Somehow, the raspberry contributions, and raspberry only, display a very nice complexity that must be sampled to understand.  The base of this beer is clearly founded upon their Belgian Red recipe, or vice versa.  Undisputably the most fruity and delicious fruit beer available.  IMO, the only fruit beer that hails in comparison in ripe fruitiness and quality would be Lindeman's Framboise draft.  This is not a Flanders Red, but rather a nonesuch fruit beer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4214,"2002-03-31",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2004 ReRate-this was one of the first ratings we did, so it did not give this beer justice.  Pours a deep cranberry hue with nice pink head.  Wonderful boquet of raspberries, vineous, sweet, sourness.  wounderful flavors of raspberries, other berries, and that wine-vineous palate.  A wonderful fruit beer from those who know it best.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

4214,"2002-01-02",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2003 The pour is a nebulous deep raspberry red, the head monstrous in size, creamy in texture, and a winsome cherry pink in color, the lace a satiny sheet to conceal the glass. The tart raspberry nose is a treat; the start sweet and sour, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is crisply acidic, fruit tart, the finish is dry and quite a treat from my usual over the top beers. A very intriguing beer, quite different as I never hunt out these types? Well I think I've made a mistake, which will not be repeated in the future.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
4214,"2001-10-03",4.9,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2004 October 2001: Great, great fruit beer; almost too intense, too fruity to really feel like a 'beer'; and I love fruit beers!  Love the sweet/tart balance, the color.  Best non-Belgian raspberry-flavored beer out there in my opinion. Wish they were still making the apple beer though.9/5/8/4/18=4.4 

Flemish Sour Tasting with MartinT & Rastacouere Part 1 #10.  New Glarus turned out to be the star of the show, and not just for the much vaunted (and now perfect, for me) Belgian Red but also for this just-as-good masterpiece of fresh raspberry goodness.  Totally opaque dark burgundy with a marvellous pink Cool-Whip topping.  Incredibly potent fresh-picked fruit aroma might just edge the Red for best fruit-beer nose in the world.  Massively fruity all the way through, with some great caramel bits, fresh raspberry leaf and chocolate.  The reason it's not quite perfect for me is that the acidity, while wonderful and necessary to keep the sweetness from cloying, is just a hair too much.  But I'm quibbling.  Do yourself a favor and get a case each of this and the Belgian Red and make everyone you know who doesn't like fruit beers gorge themselves on it.  And then tell the brewers that you'll keep doing it and buying them out until they bring back the Apple Ale!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4214,"2001-09-17",4.6,"Strong raspberry odor, very nice.  Is almost purple-ish in color.  Very tart raspberry flavor while you still get a bit of a barley malt flavor.","Oregon, Wisconsin, USA","GoPackJo99"
4214,"2001-08-29",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2003 Once again the new glarus brewery has given us all an absolutely wonderful beer to enjoy.
