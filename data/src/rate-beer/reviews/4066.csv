4066,"2016-05-10",3.0,"Pours a flat, slightly hazed golden yellow color.

Smells of funky cream cheese, mold, old cork and wet hay. Leather adds to sun dried earth and old oak, while a flowery lemon inclusion is responsible for a prominent tartness.

Almost no carbonation in this, which leads to a sour smack on the tongue, refreshing and soft in the finish, while challenging sour and dry until the swallow. 

Flowers, grass, dusty old wood and lots of blue cheese establish the foundation in this. Lemon zest hits the palate in an uncompromising, almost harsh fashion, numbing the teeth from the outside. Its flowery quality cuts through this dominant tartness during the finish, establishing a late softness on the tongue.

Big, as for its sour-dry blend, which is a bit too powerful for my palate, making it hard to pick up anything else. Has a nice finish though, with a great aqueous softness to it, soothing the lime.","GERMANY","aleigator"

A - Pours murky brown with a very small white head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace what so ever on the glass.


S - Smells of typical Cantillon must, sweet grain, some light funk, oak and some light fruitiness. Not as bright of an aroma as I was expecting it to have but still nice.


T - Starts off with the sweet bready grains quickly being joined by a nice lemony lactic sour kick, barnyard funk, musty basement, woody oak, dash of grassy hop bitterness and some earthen minerals. Finish is quite dry, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Slick, flat feel from start to finish. The dryness is pretty tiring on the palate, doubt I could drink a whole bottle of this.


O - An interesting experimental lambic to say the least. I would love to have this again once it has some years to develop, I think it could really improve with some time on it. As it is a nice thing to try but with so many other great Cantillon beers out there I doubt I would revisit it anytime soon, if given the chance.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

4066,"2013-09-14",3.8,"Sampled at Zwanze Day at WLV. Pours a very dark orange/brown in color with very head little. Some bubbles around the ring of the glass but no real head formation. Nose reminds me of grand cru brouscella. Flavor is a little yogurty, lemon rind, musty, and slightly acetic. Mouthfeel is light, lightly carbed, somewhat silky, and a moderate finish. Pretty good, I like it, but I think I prefer the regular iris.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"

4066,"2013-09-14",4.1,"Draft at Zwanze Day 2013 at West Lakeview. Pours a deep amber color with a thin white head. Aroma is fruity, lemon, yeasty, floral. Medium on the palate with very light carbonation. Almost flat. Flavor is sour, lemon, grapefruit, a little bready, with a light, sour grapefruit finish. Excellent.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
4066,"2013-09-14",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2014 On draft at Monks for Zwanze day with Simon and Barry. Pours very still brown with no head or lacing really, Notes of grape skin, funk, granny smith, oak, and barn. Lots of smooth oak but a little faint in aroma/flavor. Medium to fuller body with light carbonation. Prefer the regular Iris to this one but still nice. Tried again a couple months ago and it was hard to get down. Really flat and bland.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4066,"2013-09-14",4.0,"Zwanze Day! Iced tea pour, no head. Aroma is funky and briny, rotting wood, tart dark fruit and malt. Flavor is super oaky and acidic, light malt vinegar notes, lemon drupelets, sour cherry, basement. No carbonation but thats okay.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
4066,"2013-09-14",4.1,"Aroma has moderate fruit notes with some raisin and prune notes. Faint barnyard character with a hint of cherry. Some acetic character along with a medium oak note. Light buttery character. 
Pours an almost still copper with some brown highlights. Darker than the regular Iris. 
Flavor is fairly dry with some dark fruit - cherry and prune as well as plum. Moderate acidity with a touch of an acetic character. Low citrus notes and moderate barnyard funk. I think the phenolics I attribute to fresh Iris are actually the hops. Low bitterness with some lingering dark cherry notes and light barnyard funk. Definitely more acetic. Moderate oak notes but lighter than I was expecting. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no carbonation. Low acidic astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall an interesting interpretation of Iris. I think I enjoy it more than the Grand Cru Bruscella but less than the regular Iris. Lots more dark fruit and a bit more acetic acid.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
4066,"2013-09-14",4.2,"Draft at bierkoning Amsterdam. Pours hazy reddish copper. Aroma is vinegar, funk, barnyard and red fruits. Taste is oak, acidic and woody. Quite sour. Light bitter. Very very good, better than the normal iris for sure. Very complex. Long sour finish. Medium body with soft carbonation.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Zer0"

Delicate flavors of funk, tart apple, white pepper. Mellow low carbonation moouthfeel. Short tart finish. A classic.","Jackson Hole/McLean, Virginia, USA","Iphonephan"
4066,"2013-09-14",4.1,"Pouring at Stone Zwanze Day. Rating #6400. Flat, murky deep orange amber tea pour. Fine for unblended. Nose is a tad sticky, sweaty, something savory like worchestershire sauce. Taste is tangy, rich fruit leather, soft red grapefruit, mild thicker buttery biscuit. Superlative Iris palate is still there. But overall this is softer all around than normal Iris. Really nice spicy oak in the back. Leathery, near slick body. Long lactic finish with spicy red grapefruit flashes.Second pour: as it warms nose finally comes around as richer albeit still soft maple, pie, brown sugar rubbed red grapefruit. Very different from normal Iris with no hop character. Slick butteriness doesnt bother me since there is spicy grapefruit juice to cut through. Overall, I really enjoyed this especially the leathery palate that is the highlight of normal Iris. Still in love. Disclaimer: Im a rare Iris fanboy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
