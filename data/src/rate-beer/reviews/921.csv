921,"2014-11-06",3.0,"Overall its a pretty unobtrusive beer: well balanced, but light on flavor. Slight malt backbone with a sprinkling of hops on top leads into a hollow, bitter finish. Good, but a bit boring.","","gnomungus"

921,"2010-07-10",3.4,"Tap at Governors Island BrewFest. Pours an amber-gold with a mild, white head. Earthy hop aroma with slight notes of citrus and caramel. Flavor is pretty well balanced with light malty sweetness, slight spices and herby hops. Medium balanced with full carbonation. Finishes lightly hoppy and fairly short. Not bad.

921,"2009-11-05",3.4,"In short: A rusty hoppy beer.  Different and good.
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Almost clear copper body topped by a small off-white head
In long: Pleasant hoppy that is fruity, slightly woody and something else I couldnt put words on.  Taste is pleasant and offers a little twist.  Light-moderation fruity notes (citrus + tropical fruits), light caramel, dry bread crumbs, low sweetness sensation, rust, some dry grass.  The carbonation was a little too much.  From my description it can seem to be any other beer but really there was something about the rusty copper nature of the beer (for lack of a better word) that made it different.  It may have to do with the California Common style but Im not familiar enough with this style.  Not because it contains the word common that is common.  California Common is actually an infrequent style.  And common sense is pretty rare too if you ask me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
921,"2009-07-16",3.3,"On Tap at the brewery. Nice fuzzy golden pour with a nice head that didnt last to long.  Nice balance of hops grain with some fruity notes as a finish. Nice palate. I liked this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Maltajo"
921,"2009-05-25",3.6,"On tap at the Peekskill Brewery.  Pours a light hazy brownish amber color with a medium beige head.  I asked what hops they were using on this one  100% Mt. Hood hops from Oregon.  The nose is hoppy, but not overpowering, with background notes of sweet malt, and light hints of caramel and pineapple.  Medium bodied, rather sweet and very malty.  Finishes dry, with a light refreshing bitterness and a little bit of grain.  I was parched when I walked in and this was the first beer I had for the day, and it was a great thirst quencher.  Easy drinking, and tasty enough that I ordered a second pint.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
