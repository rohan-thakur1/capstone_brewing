2671,"2016-12-29",4.4,"Bruerys fourteenth of so far fifteen Melanges, basically a blend of leftovers from other brews, this one including the famed Black Tuesday. Loose, off-white head consisting of a thin rim of tiny bubbles, quickly reduced to almost nothing; very dark burgundy robe, almost blackish in general appearance, with a brighter ruby hue under bright light. Intense, very elegant and rich bouquet of chocolate liqueur, hot chocolate sauce, a lot of vanilla-like oak fragrance, wet furniture even, butterscotch candy, deliberately oxidized sweet sherry, melting brown sugar, tawny port, cognac, espresso, rum-soaked raisins, almond, walnut oil, candied figs, plum wine, candied banana, stewed beef hint, bayleaf, nougat. Intense candied sweetness at the tip of the tongue, candied dates, marmelade, raisins, quickly balanced out by an elderberry syrup-like spicy touch and sourishness as well as a rim of porcini-like umami; mouthfeel is expectedly thick and very oily, mouth-filling and softly carbonated. Layer upon layer of rich maltiness ensues: caramel, hazelnuts, toasted bread, bittersweet fondant chocolate and eventually a roasted coffee touch, mildly bittering but elegantly complementing the overall rounded and lush bittersweetness rather than sharpening it. Dry, tannin-rich finish in which a lot is added apart from the oak wood: spicy hops for structural balance, wet wood, and of course a long stretch of brandy- and rum-like alcohol which heats up the throat but adds complexity, warmth and depth rather than disturbing this infinitely complex symphony of malts and tannins. I was a bit skeptical towards the idea of a brewery simply blending - and rebranding - their leftovers, because that is basically what this is; I am not the greatest fan of, for instance, De Molens Cuvée series in that respect. This one, however, executes this idea to utmost perfection. I guess it is refermented in the bottle, reblending the original flavors and recarbonizing it, making it a versnijbier of very high standard, breathing maturity, depth and old age in a most delightful way. Glad I bought this.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Aromas of big caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, toasted oak, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and date; with lighter notes of leather, tobacco, chocolate, cocoa, red wine, pepper, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness. A bit boozy as it warms. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, toasted oak, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and date; with lighter notes of leather, tobacco, chocolate, cocoa, red wine, pepper, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness. Moderate bourbon/tannic oak spiciness and light roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, toasted oak, dark fruits, light chocolate/cocoa, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bourbon/oak spiciness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness, increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and very rich full body; with a very smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with a small warmth lingering after the finish; with minimal barrel booziness. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged strong ale! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Barrel presence on this is absolutely enormous, but not boozy. Mostly old ale/English barelywine character, with some lighter complimenting stout flavors.

2671,"2016-10-12",4.1,"750ml capped bottle pours a deep amber brown color with a finger and a half of tan head that leaves only a few spots of lacing behind. Aroma is dark pitted fruits with some bourbon, caramel and chocolate and hints of roasted grains. Taste is a caramel, dark fruit and chocolate malty sweetness with a light roasted grain and spicy hop bitterness. Medium to full bodied with good carbonation. A noticeable alcohol burn. Overall, a complex brew with a lot going on, balanced and tasty. Highly recommended.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"

2671,"2016-10-07",4.2,"Tap at Happy Gnome. Murky dark chocolate milk looking pour - borderline ugly but its the first pour off the keg and not sure its representative. Killer aroma of wood, bourbon, vanilla. Similar taste. Just the right amount of boozy heat. Excellent.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
2671,"2016-10-04",3.7,"Bottle shared on the deck with Lauren. Dark brown body with a quarter inch of foamy beige cap. Aromas of oak, bourbon, caramel. Rich and boozy with warming alcohol in the finish. A nice beer to sip and savor on a cool autumn evening.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
2671,"2016-09-29",4.1,"On draft at The Bruery. The pour is a dark brown, light ruby around the edges with an thin egg shell colored head and no lace. The aroma is definitely full of alcohol. There is a sweet bourbon, a light oak, and a solid vanilla. The flavor is also good. Nice vanilla and alcohol with a strong sweet malt and light dark fruit. This is almost like a Barleywine. I like it. The mouth feel is thinner and nicely carbonated with a great bourbon, vanilla, and caramel malt finish. Hell yes.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2671,"2016-09-29",4.7,"Hazy dark plummy hue under a thin ivory cap. Lovely amazing nose of cherries, caramel, oak barrel, vanilla, date, vanilla, and a kiss of brown sugary bourbon. Smooth and bright flavor that mixes bright caramelly pale malt with stone fruity flavors, a touch of grapefruit zest, and a bright oak and bourbon flavor thats also got some sweet date and fig tones, boozy brown sugar and oak, coconut and vanilla. Lovely and fruity and boozy. Amazing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
2671,"2016-09-28",4.0,"On tap at the Cloverleaf in NJ. Pours inky black with a tan ring. Aroma is sparkly, with toasted malt, dark fruits, oak. Taste balances all three beers really well: barleywine dark fruits, old ale malt, imperial stout chocolate, with some nice carbonation. Hides the alcohol decently too. Lingering meld of the three beers. Really nice.","San Diego, California, USA","dalekliz"
2671,"2016-09-28",4.0,"Shared 750 ml. bottle poured to a snifter showing a cloudy, deep brown color, with a modest layer of tan foam, and dots & dashes of lacing. The nose was dark malts, cocoa, a touch of coffee, caramel, sweetness, dark & dried fruit, a bit of oakiness, barrel induced vanilla, and ready alcohol. Ditto on the flavor, with now palatable booze & warmth, better than medium body, with low carbonation, almost syrupy texture, and a touch of tannic bitterness. An excellent sipper.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
2671,"2016-09-19",4.1,"Draft at the Bruery. Aroma of coffee, strong bourbon vanilla and raisin. Rich taste of soft raisin, vanilla, mild roast, chocolate, booze, nuts and molasses. Boozy long finish. Delicious.","NETHERLANDS","MarcoDL"
2671,"2016-09-16",3.8,"4oz draft at Rustico - Alexandria. Poured a relatively dark, but not totally pitch black color (though the bar has low-lights, so its hard to really tell). 
Flavor was an initial blast of heavy chocolate notes (milk chocolate, not chocolate malts) with a vanilla extract note, light boozy barleywine cardboard. Alcohol is most certainly there, boozy, but not terribly boozy like some high ABV beers Ive had. Took a few sips to really start digging it.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
2671,"2016-09-09",4.2,"September 9, 2016 - bottle from AV3 poured into my Bruery snifter. Dark brown pour with nice amount of head that lasted. Aroma was bourbon, wood, chocolate and vanilla. Taste was consistent with aroma, but heavy with the wood. There also seemed to be some spice in the finish.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
2671,"2016-09-02",4.0,"Very strange beer . This is my first review so sorry in advance. Pours like a murky brownish , with a large light tan head . Looks good . Aroma is some chocolate and carmel little boozy. Taste: chocolate right off the bat and lingers then gives way to the ale side of the percentage and boozy but being a 13.4 its well hidden . Gotta say this is a pretty good beer . I bought 2 bottles so maybe ill do another review after . All in all great beer and would definitely buy it again even with its 26$ tag . CHEERS!!!🍻","Pennsylvania, USA","Shanestout"

2671,"2016-08-04",3.6,"750, capped and foiled. Pours an opaque dark ebony with a dense and creamy tan head that settles away fairly quickly. Sweet nose, showing molasses and plums and vanilla and caramel and chocolate. Creamy thick body with soft carb. Molasses, plums, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel on the mid palate, with a long sweet finish. Gets a little warmer near the end.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2671,"2016-07-24",3.7,"Aromas of big bourbon, toffee, figs, dark fruits, oak, caramel, dark malts, raisins, leather and burnt sugar. Pours blackish brown with a thin tan foam and medium lace. Taste brings complex dark fruits, raisins, licorice, figs, apricots and oak upfront. Bourbon is noticeable alongside leather, vanilla, caramel and nougat. Finishes with moderate booze and more dark fruits. Overall, pretty solid with a decent amount of bourbon and tons of dark fruits. A- rating.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
