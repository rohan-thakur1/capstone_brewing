3203,"2015-10-21",3.7,"Growler from Whole Foods. There is a pleasant spicy, pine resin aroma. Very nice flavor! Wheat, lemon, some pine and grapefruit. Im not always excited by hoppy wheat beers, but this is very well balanced. There is some smooth sweetness too. Looking at the reviews, people are all over the map about this one - I guess that is the sign of an adventurous release. It was very good imo.  Btw I dont see why RB has this listed as a pale lager - Im not sure what it is, but I dont think it is that - spice/herb/veg most likely.","USA","Slipstream"

3203,"2014-10-26",4.7,"Had on draft at Roberta's in Bushwick. Didn't appreciate the plastic cups, loved the beer. Totally opaque, thin fizzies, and almost a sour taste (but in a good way). Loved it.

3203,"2014-03-06",2.1,"From tap. Pours hazy light orange. A potpourri of spice on nose, similar to a scented candle. Taste is heavy, with lots of yeast, some coriander. Drier than needed. Was glad I ordered only a half pint. Unbalanced.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","BLADT"
3203,"2014-02-19",3.4,"Growler. Ive developed quite the love/hate relationship with this beer over the past 5 minutes. On the one hand, it has some lovely noble hops character, especially one the nose, clean and balanced malts, and no real off flavors. But on the other hand, they added coriander to it for some reason. Why? This would be really good, but the coriander kind of throws me. I dont know. Its still an enjoyable beer. but Id really like to try a non-spiced version of this.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"

3203,"2013-08-30",3.0,"On tap. Mild aroma, lightly sweet, some faint spicing. Medium bodied with a malt-sweet finish. Yeast profile seems inappropriate and the beer is a touch heavy for what is supposed to be a sessionable lager. The spices also feel out of place. Not a terrible drink though.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3203,"2013-08-24",3.4,"@ Singlecut. Pours hazy golden. Aroma of coriander, other citrus, and wheat. Pretty nice. Taste brings similar flavors, though is slightly astringent. Also get some Sorachi Ace-like hempiness in the taste as well. Finished slightly sticky. A very interesting beer and Im not sure Id ever put this as a pale lager, considering its a wheat beer. Not entirely sure what Id classify it as.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
3203,"2013-07-19",3.5,"The Sampler, Brooklyn tap: Pours a hazy orange, definitely not white. Aroma is spicy and flowery... quite nice. Taste is pretty nice. A spicy tingle gives this some uniqueness points. Very easy to drink, but not bland or watery. Accessible, but adventurous. Lets also be clear that this is not a pale lager.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

3203,"2013-01-20",3.8,"Draught from their tasting room.  Hazy light yellow with a big rocky head and great lace.  The aroma is a nicely rounded and primarily herbal but with notes of grass, light citrus, wheat, and lightly sweet malt. Also there is an element thats hard to describe and I guess is probably the ""lagrrr"" yeast contribution.  These continue on the palate.  The flavor is very well balanced with a long herbal bitter finish. The mouthfeel is exceptionally soft and fresh. I could drink this all day and night and with any kind of food and be happy.  Fantastic beer.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
