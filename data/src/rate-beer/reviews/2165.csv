2165,"2015-10-05",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2015 On draught at Villi Wäinö in Helsinki and stopper-bottled direct from the brewery. That means it was the Finnish version, not the collaboration brew or something transported informally to some far-off place - Lammin Sahti has no hops and so does not travel. I am too old and polite to launch a screaming rant at ignorami who think that just because they dont get it there is something wrong with it, rather than that they have limitations. Sahti is a folk beer style. It pre-dates Ratebeerians by several centuries. You judge it by its own standards not todays simpler ones. If a sahti smells and tastes of banana bread that is because it is supposed to taste like banana bread. It is a rye beer fermented with bakers yeast or cultivated softer-end wild yeast, filtered by and infused with juniper (branches not berries) then packaged for consumption. By all means conclude it is not for you but dont even dare to contemplate that it is not for the world. It will outlast IPA à la mode, I would like to bet. And this is not A sahti, it is THE sahti.  The other Finnish sahti brewers may be the equal but none yet surpasses it.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","Tim Webb"

I wanted to drink local but sahtis turned out to be more elusive than I thought. This one was highly recommended so as soon as I found it on the tap handle I know which beer I was starting with. Fresh it is amazing and definitely vastly better than the bottled ones I have found stateside.

Aroma / Appearance - The caramel red base holds a fizzy bubbly head. It has a striking color almost like liquid red licorice. The handful of juniper, light chocolate, and wildness give the feel of drinking in a rural cabin far from the noise of a city during a long winter.

Flavor / Palate - Gooseberries, figs, and juniper awaken the palate. After the first wave it builds up until it becomes a bit like drinking licorice candy. The Hersheys kiss finish is accented by fig newtons. If not for the price and other bottles to sample I would have drunk this all night.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2165,"2006-02-08",3.5,"(500 ml flip-top bottle: Obtained in trade with bogdi1, thanks Juha!, and shared with SDbruboy) One of the most rewarding things about sharing unique beers with friends is the fresh perspective they can give on a beer.  When I poured this Sahti, the first thing I noticed was bananas and because it was quite an abundant aroma, I just instinctively thought of ripe bananas.  But a friend who tried the beer corrected me and said it was unripe green/pale yellow bananas.  He was absolutely on the money, and now I will be able to identify that distinction from here on out.  Anyway, yes, the nose is dominated by the scent of a banana that you eat a day too early, the banana that is just starting to turn yellow and doesnt quite peel fully.  I also get a hint of sourness and some light smoke.  But wow, the flavor is vastly different from the aroma.  Mostly, tart citrus is in the foreground, tart and acidic with only a hint of sweetness.  Plenty of banana of course, and again, green banana, but the tart citrus is more prominent.  It has an herbal quality and no bitterness, and Im reminded slightly of coriander for some strange reason.  When I opened the flip-top bottle, hardly a pssst could be heard, and so carbonation levels are quite low.  Not a problem because even though there is minimal carbonation on the palate, the tart and acidic character of this Sahti is quite playful on the tongue and is an adequate substitution for the carbonation in terms of mouthfeel.  Light-medium bodied and quite refreshing, but I think Id prefer a touch more body.  Dark yellow-amber in color and fairly cloudy on the first pour, but subsequent pours are downright muddy.  Of course, the beer poured with almost no head, just a few random bubbles that clung to the edge of the glass.  Overall, quite a treat for me to sample yet another fresh Finnish Sahti, a traditional style that I obviously greatly enjoy.  Juha and I will just have to keep trading so that I can get my occasional fix in.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Still opaque orange...someone (Stephen?) mentions its similarity in color and aroma to Cantillon Fou Foune...perhaps...brie/camembert strong ammoniac old cheesiness, funky...vegetal..asparagus...definitely unique...the the flavor:  massively sour, old grapefruit juice with acidic woods and spices...too much for me, burning and stomach-turning, almost...massive burning chemical sensation as it goes down...no gueuze is this unpleasant.

2165,"2005-03-29",1.8,"Bottle at the Sunset grill. An off-white ring covers the orange-amber body. Weird aroma is extremely yeasty, very rice-like, bready and spiced fish like through its orange zest components and strong rye and urine notes. Extreme acidity level, very alcoholic, lingering peanut oil finish, fishy lemon post taste. Sharply acidic texture, aggressive, astringent. This is certainly very exotic and original, but I certainly dont believe this is supposed to taste like this. Extremely hard to drink.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2165,"2005-02-09",3.0,"Hazy golden amber, with the fastest receding head Ive ever seen.  Spicy wheaty aroma, touch of hefe-clove, as well as appley-spice.   Very odd, spicy sour flavor.  Starts with more apple spice,  with a little wheatiness in the middle and then heads to a sort of ketchupy sweet and sour thing, with an almost metallic nine volt battery zing.  Nutmeggy notes as well.  Talk about schizo...","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

2165,"2005-01-10",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2007 Bottle in a trade with Heemer77.  Thanks so much Eric, Id been badly wanting to try this!  Pour reveals a wonderful (in my opinion) looking beer.  I like heavily hazed, murky looking beers and this fit the bill.  Fiery orange, deep copper and gold hues all swirl about, with a small, moderately lasting white head.  Aroma of white wine vinegar, black pepper, salt, cabbage, rhubarb, and plenty of pickled beets right on the end.  Wow, this is going to be interesting.  And it certainly is.  Very sour, moderately acidic, with some strong, drying herb-like notes.  Resemblance to spoiled carrot/celery juice, perhaps. Very spicy as well, with a sweet-and-sour sort of effect.  It finishes with a strong bitterness, some salty malt like flavoring, but no real evidence of the cabbage/beets that I get out of the aroma.  Tingly mouthfeel, with a medium body, some wateriness.  Alcohol does not seem apparent.  I hope to try the rest of the Lammin line at some point.  Thanks so much Eric!<","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Some hay, sweet and sour sauce, and spruce flavor bring out the body and a very interesting complexity.  Viscous palate leads to a dry tart finish.  A very weird style that Id like to try more of.

2165,"2004-12-21",3.6,"Bottled: Muddy water with no lace but that was expected. The aroma is funky and cheesy with major yeast notes. Also detected water chestnuts, mild grassy esters and noticeable juniper berry on the nose as well. The taste starts tart and spicy with a lot of sublime fruity undertones. Yeasty with a stange but nice depth of palate. Despite the tartness, but feel is smooth. The whole is unique indeed. Im am starting to develop a liking for this style.

Smelled like a pickled turnip from the Beruit Place in town.  Not a good thing.  Copper color,like cider, with a white head.  The taste was vinegar sourness, mustyness, and woody all rolled into one.  I like it quite a bit, except for the smell.

Flavor is Bavarian weizen like with banana esters, clove, but with hints of chocolate.  Very low carbonation, actually pretty flat, medium body, and only mild alcohol warmth.

Aroma has little bit of banana, but it is strongly overruled by yeast. Flavor has very malty and sweet start, but fast it changes to be pretty yeasty. I like this sahti over two Finlandias because of more yeast, but maybe one bottle at the time is enough.

Sweet flavor with toffee, apple, asparagus and banana. Alcohol not present at all. Medium-bodied, slicky palate with absolutely no carbonation. Very easily drinkable!
