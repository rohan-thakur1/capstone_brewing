2995,"2016-09-11",2.8,"40oz bottle from IBrew2or3. Cheers, Dave! Pours a clear amber with an ephemeral white head. Nose is corn, floral hops, booze, and huge sweetness. Flavor is similar with big booze, corn, floral hops, more booze, big sweetness, and some soda effervescence. Medium to full in body, syrupy, and unique.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

2995,"2016-04-24",3.3,"Man-sized can shared - appropriately - at the 2016 RateBeer Best Awards. Many thanks to Joe for procuring and sharing this regional gem. The beer pours clear honey-gold with a frothy, white head. The nose holds simple white bread and light caramel. Medium to heavy sweet flavour, with some cereal, honey, caramel, pale breads. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Sugary finish, with further pale bread, alcohol, light cereal and caramel, almost no bitterness. Pretty solid malt liquor. Good boost, but still very drinkable.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
2995,"2016-03-28",2.8,"Can. Pours gold with a white head. Cereal grains and honey malt notes, low bitterness, some light fusel sweetness, and really a relatively clean finish for the style. Solid.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
2995,"2016-03-13",3.0,"RBWG16. Oh yeah, its a real tasting now. Thanks Joe for sharing this beauty. Theres no appearance rating from this since I chugged it straight out of the 32oz can. The sense of aroma I get through the tiny can opening offers up a nice corn sensation as well as booze and a bit of fusels. The taste delivers decent levels of sweet corn notes and then quickly getting into boozy fusel chemicals. Pretty decent ML and rated not as intended as it was on the warm side.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2995,"2016-02-28",2.8,"Can @ RBWG 2016. Thanks to Joe for sharing this fine malt beverage. Clear golden beer with a short lived white head. Theres a big time corn sugar and apple juice sweetness to it. Mild grape drink, too. A touch of soap and wax, maybe. This is pretty much your usual malt liquor but is a little better and actually surprisingly decent.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2995,"2016-02-25",2.2,"Big can shared by Joenugs at the RB Best Awards - thanks again, Joe, for saving us from an embarrassing hunt on behalf of Homer321. The can has a pretty cool black top. Pours a clear gold with a small lasting white head. Notes of corn, cereal, apple, sugars, grains, and faint metallic notes. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a boozy, sweet mouthfeel. Its a malt liquor.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2995,"2016-02-12",1.6,"[1/30/16] Bottle sample at the Encomium bottle share, after RateBeer Best awards ceremony at Hyatt Vineyard Creek Hotel in Santa Rosa. Thanks everyone who shared bottles! Golden. Grainy, corn, alcohol. Sweet.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
2995,"2016-02-06",2.2,"40 oz. bottle. It pours a clear golden color with a small white head. The aroma is pretty potent with corn, grain, plastic, alcohol and green apple. The flavor is the same with more of the plastic, corn and alcohol. A little hop spice in the finish. Carbonation and mouthfeel are both pretty good. Warming as it goes down. A pretty standard high boost malt liquor. The freshness of this one probably helps it out some. Not something I would want to drink very much of due to the plastic notes.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
2995,"2016-02-02",2.4,"Can. Pours a dark gold with no head. The aroma is grain and corn malt. Medium mouth, corn malt, grain, honey, boozy finish, max boost bruh.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
2995,"2016-02-02",2.6,"Can at the RBWG hotel share 
Clear golden with a small white head, some lacing. Aroma of honey and sweet grains. Taste of corn and hot alcohols 
Smelled good, but the taste was malt liquor","Utah, USA","Sledutah"
2995,"2016-02-02",2.4,"Can, thanks joeneugs! Clear golden liquid with medium white head. Aroma of grain, sweet corn, bread and earth. Taste is light sweet and very light bitter with notes of corn, grain and sugar. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Fuck yeah.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"
2995,"2016-02-01",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2016 Damn solid malt. With honey. It pours a funky dark yellow, average look and slight head that vanishes. Smell is syrup and corn, alcohol and fruit. Bit alcohol smell that dominates. Taste follows. Bold alcohol, sweet intermixing. The alcohol fights the sweetness back which brings balance to the malt. This is a sipper, not a chugger. Palate is cleaning, drying, and leaves you begging for more.","Oakland, California, USA","ffbot"
2995,"2016-01-30",3.0,"Can at RBWG. Pours a clear golden yellow appearance with a big white head. Aroma has creamed corn, lemon, candy, and soda. Moderate high sweetness and low bitterness. Sweet and candy like but not a bad malt.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
2995,"2016-01-30",3.0,"First rate. Major cred and even major thanks to Joenugs for bringing this whale. Nose is strong corn and light sugar. Taste is lightly peppery and sweet. Not fucken bad","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
