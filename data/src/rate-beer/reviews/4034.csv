Some herbal notes as well. Gets a bit dank on the flavor, but otherwise much like the nose. Finishes decently bitter, and a hint tart. Crisp and clean mouthfeel.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Mouthfeel is juicy and super sessionable with lots of dank citrus, funky tropics and gentle sugar.

4034,"2015-12-02",3.5,"On tap at Hill Farmstead. An unclear pale golden beer topped by a creamy, fingerthick white head leaving lacing. The aroma is a bit neutral, with pine cones and lemon zest as well as some pale malts. Resins, lemon zest and a decent bitterness in the mouth, the malts pushed to the back. Its dry and medium to full-bodied, with a nice carbonation level. Rather long finish. Overall, a tad boring I think, but sure a nice beer anyway.

4034,"2015-06-28",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 20, 2015 Draught at Armsby, 6/28/15The usual HF appearance, much like Dupont with a massive, thick white head that is endlessly retained. Moderately hazy body is a peachy-gold color.Spicey/earthy hop notes dot the otherwise tangy citric array that is galaxy. A strange hop, perhaps not quite as much so as mosaic, but definitely given to some weird interpretations. Juicy apricot, tangy grapefruit and perhaps a touch of chardonnay-like grape skin on the very end. Otherwise, sparse yet supple malts provide stucture, and dryness prevails, with no alcohol or flaw noted.Juicy, stone fruit and pulpy citrus with tangy, pine-tinged bitterness kick off the slightly punchy flavor. Softer mango and honey-laced grapefruit round things out, as the creamy texture controls the hop delivery. Quite dry, with some papery/earthy notes from the hop particulate (assumedly) and yet a juicy, almost tart-like hop finish that is quite clean and swallows up the palate. None of the peachiness or pine from the Conduct and with a touch more bread dough showing through. Straightforward pale ale and does justice to this interesting, popular hop.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Nose is lovely as with all hoppy Hill Farmstead beers, with loads of floral hops, a little citrus and soft pillow malt underneath. Flavour follows accordingly, with loads of floral hops dominating, with secondary notes of citrus and a touch of pine. Not massively hoppy, but certainly a big punch of flavours. Low bittering hops that dont leave much astringency. Another wonderful, highly quaffable rendition to this great series. Excellent beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

A - Like most of Shauns pale ales, unfiltered and incredibly cloudy. This is more of a grapefruit juice appearance with a sticky 3 finger white head. 

S - Aroma is standard to most galaxy hop beers with passionfruit, grapefruit and a light dank pine aroma.

T - Taste is actually as expected. Chewy Grapefruit skin, pine cone finish with a sweetness in the center. I also get hay / mulch for some reason.

M - Very crisp mouthfeel but its not as bright or tingly as the most recent single-hops of late (Citra, Amarillo). Its still a solid heavy oily texture with a very bitter lingering finish.

O - Solid beer for what is actually become one of my last favorite hop varieties but as usual, well crafted beer.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
