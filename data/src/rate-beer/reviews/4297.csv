4297,"2013-12-05",3.5,"Bottle thanks to jrob21. Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a small head that fades to a ring and leaves some decent lacing. Aroma is very grainy with some lemons and grass. Taste has a nice sweet fruitiness to go along with the big grainy malt and lemons. Light spicy Saaz hop finish. Very nice Helles lager.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
4297,"2013-11-24",3.4,"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy yellow with a white head and lots of bubbles. Toasty grain and hay aromas. Light flavor with a bitter pungent lemon flavor towards the em of the sip. Light and refreshing with a little more body than what the look would leave you to believe.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"

4297,"2013-11-15",3.3,"Pours slightly hazy straw color with a finger of white head. Aroma is yeasty with fruity barnyard earthy notes. There is a good rounded smooth citrus as well. The pilsner malt is definitely apparent (which Im not too big a fan of), but there are enough other flavors at work that it is not the only flavor to dwell on. The only flavors I dont like in this beer come mainly from the pilsner malts which exude a sort of stale flavor in my mind. Not bad for the style though.","Atlanta, GEORGIA","rollinsr"
4297,"2013-11-13",3.7,"12 oz. Pours clear golden with a lively body supporting a lasting film of meringue on top. Nose is sweet toasted malt and a touch of citrus zest and grass. Taste is minty citrus hop, light toast and caramel. Medium body is smooth and tingly-dry with medium carbonation. Nice sessioner that seems just a tad hoppy to be a great traditional example of the style, but it tastes better than most that are more traditional.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
4297,"2013-11-08",3.1,"Albany, Ga. - Warehouse Package Store - 12 oz bottle. Pours a medium golden with just a slight bit of murkiness to it - faint white head. Grainy, cereal-like aroma with some wort-like essence. Flavor has some corn cereal notes, some bready-toasty hints and some dry notes in the finish. Medium thick mouthfeel - leans to the dry side.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
4297,"2013-11-03",4.2,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Pours a nearly clear, straw yellow with a thick, rocky nearly two finger white head. The head stays almost the entire time the beer is in the glass and the lacing is decent as well.

I wish the aroma was a bit stronger but it is a pleasant bouquet of lemon, hay, grass, and some light fruitiness. Not really any malt that I can pick up.

Lemon and grass is up front in the taste along with a strong noble hop character that is a bit floral/grassy. It is a bit sweet with a nice bready malt undertone that is appropriate for the style Mouthfeel is very soft and almost slick. Finishes with a bit of lingering bitterness and light sweetness.

Overall, a very good beer for the style. Nails it nearly perfectly and would be a very pleasant warm weather beer.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"
4297,"2013-11-02",3.5,"Bright, clear yellow, with a nice white head. Smells lightly fruity, with grassy hops and crackery malts. Taste is toasty malt and a light peppery finish. A tasty beverage.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
4297,"2013-11-01",4.1,"On tap at Cumming Taco Mac. Hazy pale straw color with foamy white head. Aroma of bread malts, honey, and corn flakes. Taste just the same. Sweet malts, grains, a tad bit of honey, with a little bitter tingle. Really enjoyed this Helles!! Light and refreshing. Definitely sessionable. Will definitely have it again!","Georgia, USA","ellolovey"
4297,"2013-10-24",3.1,"On tap at the Prado Taco Mac. Light yellow pour, bubbly, with a small, pillowy, persistent, white head, and good lacing. The aroma is biscuit dough, lemon zest, light coriander, bubblegum, and light, resinous hops. The flavor is light, mellow sweetness, and low-grade bitterness in the finish. Light body, zesty, and crisp. Overall, this is a good, balanced, light, sessionable beer.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

4297,"2013-10-13",4.1,"Tap @ TacoMac. Yellow pour, white foam. Aroma of pale grains, Pilz malts, steamed corn, light cardboard box, loads of bread. Flavor of pale cereal malt, hardy grains, dominant flavor of straw/hay. Very well balanced. Quite delicious. Yeah I?m definitely going to drink this one again and again. Way better than the old Crank Tank, which I think was a rye. (3848)","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
4297,"2013-10-11",3.2,"Bottle pour of a clear light gold with a slightly lacy nice white head. Aroma of straw with slight bready and sweet honey. Clean light refreshing taste of straw with a hint of bitter citrus hops blended with just a hint of sweet Hawaiian bread. Over all clean and refreshing beer that's not too heavy. It's a great beer to finish a long ride.
