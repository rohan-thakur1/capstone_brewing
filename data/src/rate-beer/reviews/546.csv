546,"2015-11-22",3.5,"Bottle from unknown place. Pours pitch black with a thin khaki head. Some pepper notes on the nose along with a big roasted chocolate roast note. Not a lot of pepper on the tongue at this point or much whisky influence. Yet it's a really good porter with a nice hop note to go with the roasted malt. Nice.

546,"2012-10-24",3.8,"On draft at Craft Beer Co. Id found the base beer to be solid and intense in its singular focus, with the chiles at times being a bit too potent. Somehow, perhaps improbably, the barrel aging here actually brings out some more subtlety in the base in addition to imparting its own flavors. Theres a pronounced chocolatey dimension to it that is enhanced here, balancing out the heat from the booze and subduing the chipotle a bit too. Very slight tannins stitch things together a bit, and theres a healthy smoke component to the brew too. Overall, quite nice.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

I cant pin it down, Ill call it sweet red flavour. Thick smooth yum!! This probably is the best spayside aged brew Ive ever had. the spayside and the chipotle seem to work perfectly together.

The finish is dry with medium bitterness from the roast (no hop detected really) and a lingering earthy wooden note. This is a really complex brew with a great array of flavors.

546,"2012-05-10",3.7,"In the end I like this version better despite the near total fade of the pepper effect. Black with a medium brown cap and sparse spotting. The sweet strength of the speyside dosage has not entirely killed the pepper like the flavour had happen to it. Mellow scotch notes showing vanilla, borderline grains and apple, deep nonsweet roast, maraschino cherries, biscuit, dark chocolate somewhere maybe and maybe even a relative to soy sauce... not sure but it all smells good minus the lack of chipotle that was so prominent in the regular version. The first thing that hits in the flavour is a sweet red fruit thing that does morph into the veggie pepper flavour uniformly. The heat comes mainly near the finish but in a mellow way. Smooth and soft mouthfeel and taste. Plenty of hard roast and vanilla and chalk, fuck balls - Suicidal Tendencies: Controlled by Hatred.... how did I forget about this song for years?

546,"2012-04-10",4.2,"375ml bottle. Pours an opaque black, with a smallish dark tan head, which lasts fairly well and leaves good lacing. Bitter dark chocolate and coffee notes are blended with the peaty, maritime tang of Speyside scotch and the smoky heat of chipotle chilli in an unusual but very pleasant aroma. Mild herbal hops mix with more powerful chipotle smokiness up front before giving way to smooth, dark malt notes of black coffee and dark chocolate. The Speyside barrel ageing becomes more evident towards the finish, with a definite flavour of peat and faint brine notes. The chipotle asserts itself strongly at the end, leaving a lingering smoky heat. On paper the combination of porter, chilli and whisky does sound a bit odd, but it works very well.

The taste is basically a nice deep robusta porter aged in a floral Speyside barrel with nutty and earthy components throughout. It is not till the sip is long gone that a MILD spicy heat comes about. It works it magic but I sit here still wanting more... much more. The palate is expected ashy and soft. Add a bit more Chipote, a bit more smoke and less green apple this would be a big hit.

546,"2012-03-25",3.4,"Poured into a snifter. This one was quite pricey at $12.

4.5 A: Black color. Three fingers of medium brown, frothy/creamy head. Retention is very good and a healthy sized ring of lacing is left behind.

4.5 S: I love me some chilis and this beer has the chipotles way up in the forefront. After that theres ample chocolate. The whiskey isnt very strong. If I hadnt read the label, I probably wouldnt have even detected it. Supple roastiness and maybe a touch of oak and caramel. I dont think Id be this impressed if the chipotles werent done perfectly.

3.5 T: The flavors dont mesh nearly as well in the taste. Foremost, the whiskey seems to be a bit off as it gives out a leathery tanginess that I dont quite care for. Too much peat as well. The chilis are done very well again though. They add a great flavor while being reserved with the heat. The chocolate and roastiness are congruent with the peppers. Moderately powerful smokiness. I think if I got a hold of the regular version, Id like it better.

3.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could use some more creaminess. Tannic astringency on finish.

3.5 D: This was a tasty beer, but I think its mostly due to the peppers. The barrel aging did not improve this beer and I feel confident saying that without having had the original.

546,"2012-01-21",4.3,"12.7 ounce bottle.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head.  The head stays around a little while, and theres a decent amount of lacing.  The brew smells like smoky whisky, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of chilies.  It tastes like bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, smoky/peaty whisky, oak, and some light chilies.  The chili flavor does get stronger as the beer warms up, but its not close to being overpowering at all.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its a bit creamy and coating, and has moderate, soft carbonation.  It certainly goes down easy enough.  I think its a pretty good brew.

546,"2012-01-02",4.1,"Pours a dark chocolate brown that appears pitch black and completely opaque in the glass with a 1.5 finger mocha head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Streaks of lacing left behind. 

Bold roasted malt aroma with a nice barrel presence that doesnt overpower the elements of the base beer. Some toasted oak and vanilla along with a sweet booze/whiskey presence. Underneath there is a slightly smokey, meaty dark malt presence with a strong dark chocolate character along with some oatmeal, toffee and chili powder. The chipotle presence is subtle in the nose allowing the other notes to come through. 

Slightly chewy medium body with a nice balance of barrel, whiskey, roasted malt and chili. Not quite as complex as the aroma suggests but there is a lot going on here. The Speyside whiskey is well integrated into the flavor with some sweet booze that gives off little heat. Theres also some dry, toasted oak that is complimented by a nice roasted malt presence. Slightly smokey with hints of bacon, toast, dark chocolate, caramel and toffee. There is a decent amount of sweetness from the whiskey and chocolate notes countering the dry/roasted character. The chipotle peppers are most prominent toward the back end of the palate but again, this flavor is well integrated into the flavor without overpowering everything. A subtle touch of peppery heat that goes really well with the silky chocolate, roasted malt and whiskey barrel flavors. 

Given Mikkellers reputation I was skeptical that this might turn into a whiskey or chili bomb but its surprisingly well balanced and complex. Considering all thats going on, its still pretty easy to drink, although the chipotle heat intensifies as it warms.

The barrels seem to drown out some of the malts from the flavor; light bakers chocolate, still very smoky, chipotle towards the finish, malt flavoring, dry oak, and some roasted coffee in the back.  The palate is seemingly less than medium, watery, silky, and nearly lively.  The beer finishes long with chocolate syrup, dark coffee roast, and chipotle heat.
