242,"2011-07-08",3.4,"Beau liquide jaune scintillant surmonté dune tête mousseuse impeccablement blanche et solide.  Quelques traces restent collées au verre.  Le nez est peu affirmé, dans le registre du style, avec des effluves de houblons nobles et des céréales qui apportent une certaine douceur.  Les saveurs sont délicates, touchées par un malt posé et par des houblons qui développent une amertume légère.  Aucune touche fruitée nest parvenue à séchapper de la concoction.  En bouche, le liquide surprend par sa corpulence plutôt moyenne.  Leffervescence me semble parfaite et la texture est douce.  La finale est finement houblonnée et un peu sèche.  Belle bière parfaite pour la terrasse.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
242,"2011-07-03",3.5,"Verre de 12 oz, à la brasserie. Arômes de céréales et de houblon floral. Robe blonde pâle et légèrement trouble, petite mousse et effervescence relativement délicate. En bouche, on retrouve une base de céréales relativement corpulente, sans être vraiment sucrée. La levure apporte une touche fruitée (raisins verts), ainsi quun soupçon de souffre. Le houblon floral est présent, mais moins expressif quau nez. Finale relativement douce, présentant une légère amertume. Agréable, mais jaurais préféré une bière un peu plus croustillante et expressive.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
242,"2011-01-25",3.5,"Dégustée en fût sur place. De couleur dorée et très légèrement voilée. Nez de grains de malt pâle, moyen de houblon floral avec des notes fruitées (agrumes) et de miel. Moyenne-mince en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et une texture légèrement crémeuse et aux petites notes huileuses. Léger goût fruité (agrumes) lors de lentrée en bouche auquel se rajoute rapidement un goût de grains de malt pâle frais, des petites notes de pain ainsi que des traces de caramel doux. Parallèlement, lon retrouve une légère-moyenne amertume asséchante de houblon floral et aux notes herbeuses en arrière-goût durant toute la gorgée et ce, jusquen finale. Post-goût moyen et un peu sec, léger-moyen amer de houblon floral et légèrement herbeux avec des petites notes fruitées (zest dagrumes). (hiver 2006-07)","Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Viper666"

242,"2008-02-15",3.6,"Pale, clear gold color, perhaps not as effervescent as its Köln brethren. Crunchy euro hops aroma, fresh lettuce, light honey. Goes down easy, smooth, with warm malts. Very well crafted. This is going to end up as one of my highest kolsches, which is fine, but truth to be told Id take one of those over this any day.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
242,"2007-08-25",3.6,"Wheaty nose, whitish colour with foamy head. Perfect carbonation, as they get spot on throughout the lineup. Medium and soft mouthfeel. Some sweet fruit in there. Drying. Listed as 6% on the menu. Not what I expected for a kolsch, but a very good summer beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
242,"2007-05-28",3.6,"Light golden in colour, long lasting thin white coloured head, great lacing.  The aroma is floral, very herbal, fruity, lots of pale malts, soft and slightly sweet.  The flavour is quite floral, herbal, perfumy, light caramel, bready, some soft caramel.  Creamy mouthfeel, medium/light body, medium/high carbonation.  Finishes with a fairly good length, some leftover floral hops co-mingle with some herbs.  Still new to the Kölsch, but I am really liking the softness of this.
Draught at <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? target=blank>Bedondaine et Bedons Ronds in Chambly, Quebec on December 28, 2006.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"

242,"2007-02-08",3.7,"Draught pint at the brewpub on 1/28/07A fluffy, large, white head tops a well-conditioned, unfiltered, light goldenrod colored body with light carbonation and a high clarity.  Head is well-retained and laces moderately.Authentic Kolsch yeast is immediately recognizable in the nose, with flowery, soft hops sitting behind it.  Pale malts further soften things and add mounds of honey.  It still manages enough crispness on the end, however, due to a bite from the yeast and moderate hop bitterness.  Definitely fresh-smelling, unpasteurized and all, and importantly, very clean.  No flaws of any type, not a touch of diacetyl.  Warming produces light doughiness and some sweeter, and perhaps slightly more soggy pale malt apparency.  Medium to medium-high strength of aroma, with no alcohol noted.Upon first sip, the texture is immediatley perceived as very generous.  Low carbonation, but very engaging/tight, provides a near creamy mouthfeel.  Plentiful maltiness; white bread, honey, light dough, all set in on the palate, giving way, somewhat to a fantastic kolsch yeastiness on the finish, dotted with peppery/herbal hop bitterness and light mineral-like sourness.  After a few sips, its definitely apparent that while the beer is highly flavorful and carefully brewed/lagered, the attenuation level is noticeably too low.  It gets a little too chewy-sweet, especially towards the finish, where you would expect more crispness to emerge.  Warming just exacerbates the problem.In my mind, though it certainly goes against the goal of a kolsch (drinkability), its not a mortal flaw and one that is easily correctable in subsequent batches.  What is impressive is the quality of hop, yeast and malt flavor alongside a flawless presentation.  Not a hint of corn/vanilla/apple/butter.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
242,"2006-12-24",3.7,"Draught. Clear golden-straw body with a small white covering. The aroma is great - doughy malt along with floral citrus hops. Lots of toasted bread flavour and caramel malts, grass, hay, minerals and nice sweet attributes. I could drink a few of these in a session.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
242,"2006-12-19",3.4,"12 oz draught at the brewpub in the company of Goldorak and MDS.  Wow, the perfect beer to start off with after a 2-hour drive....pours clear gold with a smallish lasting white head....fairly standard but well-done fresh grassy, perfumy aroma, a bit weak at first but it develops a bit after five minutes....nicely crisp, a touch honeyish, subtle malts and just enough grassy bitterness to keep it from stickiness....bit metallic at the finish but not problematically so....easy drinking and simple with a balance expertly tilted to the malt without sacrificing light tingly bitterness,  just what I want in the style.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

242,"2006-09-14",3.5,"The pour reveals a cloudy yellow color with a thin white head. Good aroma of hay with a mild citric side. The flavor has a strong hay dominance, it is also citric. The body is light with a dry mouthfeel and lively carbonation. This is a pretty good, refreshing and overall well made kölsch.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

242,"2006-07-10",3.0,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2007 Almost clear dark yellow body with a rather large and long lasting white head.  Very malty with a dominant cereal/biscuit taste.  Honey and some fruity notes.  Medium carbonation.  Medium and slightly oily body.  One of the best Kölsch Ive had but that doesnt mean much since the style doesnt do it to me.  Overall this is an Agace Pissette that doesnt get me exited.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
242,"2006-07-08",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2007 Any first impressions?
-A creamy head settles atop the veiled golden, lacing generously.
-Prominent pils maltiness and delicate spicy hoppiness proffer a most rich,  noble aroma.
-Luscious cereals and fine citrusy hoppiness meld into a wealthy Czech-pils like body, without the Czech yeast of course.
-The crunchy maltiness is so healthy and inviting; I would never have imagined that fulfilling of a body in a Kölsch.

What if you dig deeper?
-The peppery, citrusy gentle hop wave which closes every sip is prolonged by a dry wooden undertow.
-The complex maltiness even evolves into biscuit and toast characters.
-The superb balance and drinkability of it all grew on me as I downed my glass.
-This (apparently) unfiltered Kölsch is an evident testament to this brewers prowess.

242,"2006-06-28",3.4,"Slightly cloudy yellow hue, with a frothy white head, nice wet straw and lemony floral hop accents, pale malt, hint of vanilla spiciness in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a crisp spicy pale malt character, with hop citrusy note, grainy mild cereal accent, leading towards a fruity, faint hop dryness finish.","montréal, Quebec, CANADA","rederic"
242,"2006-06-23",3.9,"Bright sunny golden hue shows just a light haze. The head is white, pretty regular, fully lasting and with a clinging aspect. Fine tuned cereals come heavy in the nose of gracious extraction. Surprisingly low carbonation works pretty well here, probably thanks to the brightness and freshness of the hops. The dry-out effect comes gradually, smoothly and leading you by the hand towards the effective floral, herbal, eventually slightly rocky and minimally mineral bitterness. Firm medium body, showcasing its malty roots and low (if any) filtration. Highly drinkable, perfect after a good bike ride. Superb Kolsch!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
