4553,"2015-04-12",4.0,"U Tri Ruzi. One of our favorite restaurants in Prague, and definitely one of the coolest beer restaurants / gastropubs Ive been to. Beautiful, deep-colored comic art all over the walls in a fun theme intertwining people, nature, and beer. We went to the third floor and were in one of the small rooms with its own little bar. The bartender / server was friendly and joked around with us. First up was the svetly. Super hoppy pils. A bit more grit than Urquell (which is of course my benchmark...and should be everyones...its the ""original"" after all!). Yum.","California, USA","cmc619"

4553,"2014-01-24",3.8,"Draft at brewpub. Certainly different from the other CZ pils I had on the trip, and deliciously so. Darkish amber, More body and slight fruity notes while maintaining a dry, czech pils hop backbone. Very nice. A bit more expensive, even in Prague where prices are already higher than other places in CZ, but well worth it and still a steal when compared to US or other country prices.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Jayb0"

Aroma of light grassy hops but sufficiently tame to really let the subtle crisp honey malt notes shine through, very elegant balance. Fresh bread crust. Palate is astonishing, so full and well built, not sweet at all, perfectly silky. Crisp and ultra clean. Very very good.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
4553,"2013-03-11",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Bready malt notes reveal honeyed depths as spicy Saaz builds a tantalizing, elegant finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam lingers atop the misty golden.
-The mouthfeel is rich, yet the finish is almost dry.
-Malt flavors are beautifully extracted.
-Butterscotch angles are found upon warming.
