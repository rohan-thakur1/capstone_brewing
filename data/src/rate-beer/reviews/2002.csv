Pours a dark amber, almost brown color with golden orange edges and a  two finger white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring.

Another dessert beer aroma nailed by Funky Buddha.  Smells just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but unfortunately not like a beer.  Its odd thats its called No Crusts because bread crust is one of the strongest characteristics of the nose.  Lots of freshly baked bread with roasted peanut and jammy jelly.   Strong roasted nut character followed by welchs grape.   A bit seedy as well.  Crazy that they replicated the aroma of one of my favorite meals but I wish that it smelled(and tasted) a bit more like beer. 

Medium bodied with a nice balance of toasted peanut, sweet, slightly tart jelly and fresh bread.  Roasted with lots of peanut flavor up front along with slightly smoked malt undertones.  More peanut than peanut butter but it still replicates the flavor pretty well.  This is followed by fresh baked bread (including  crust) and a really prominent sweet, tart jam presence in the finish.   The jelly portion of the beer is really overpowering after a few ounces and provides a lingering unpleasant aftertaste.  The subtle roasted malt notes were the only element that made it taste like a brown ale.  Other than that it tastes more like a  good alcoholic dessert drink than a beer.  Decent but nowhere near as good as some of their other experimental beers.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

3.5 A: Hazed light brown color. One finger frothy light beige head.

4.5 S: This certainly delivers on the name. Tons of grape jelly. Crunchy peanut butter behind that. Light breadiness indicative of an actual PBJ.

3.5 T: As good as the nose is, the taste is disappointing. It is still a good beer, but it tastes watered down. Way less jelly and a lot less peanut butter. Still a PBJ, put one using light peanut butter and sugar free jelly.

2.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Over carbonated by a decent amount. This is the major failure of this beer. I logically crave a chewy, stick to your mouthtop type of body - rich and velvety, but that isnt what I got.

3.5 D: Good beer, but the mouthfeel is far too light and the taste is lacking power.

Aroma of salted peanut shells upfront and remain predominantly so with softer fruit undertones which are held mostly in check by the assertive peanut forwardness.... Semi-sweet flavor profile with more fresh peanut shells with a backing saltiness perspective towards the backend. Fruits, lending more towards the berry side of the house, while remaining somewhat sweet and then transitioning back to a salted peanut focus. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation.

bottle thanks to my awesome girlfriend...split with ericandersnavy.
Poured a nice brown with about a finger of head...
The nose was.. a huge letdown. it honestly smelled like bean sprouts with a bit of peanut in there.... There was a fresh ""green"" aroma I could only link to the smell of bean sprouts, or alfalfa sprouts. There was a hint of raspberry... which I could say was jelly.
Taste was very sweet in the front, and finished a bit on the tart side. In the middle there was peanut flavor, but again, it seemed like fresh peanut flavor, green... eric said it best when he said it seemed like boiled peanuts. If anyone is from the south, it tasted like the boiled peanut water. No jelly at all. To be honest, i got mustard on the finish. Does anyone put mustard on a PB and J? I dont eat them, so I dont know, but I assume not. 
The mouthfeel was great, I cant remember the last time I had something with such tiny carbonation! it was like an explosion in my mouth, fantastic!
Overall though, this was a huge letdown. I was expecting so much, and got so little in return. I am glad actually have someone I tried this with that will rate it though... 
Maybe I had a bad bottle? I dont know, but from their other offerings i have tried and rated, this was a huge letdown.","Oregon, USA","crusianbeer"
2002,"2011-07-16",3.8,"Pour from a small bottle shared with Kan on a warm Chicago pre- Pitchfork  afternoon. Murky brown in color with a small tan head hefty aromas of dry peanuts. Medium thin body which was a bit disappointing. Brown semi sweet caramel malt flavors along side the nutty presence. Dont get much fruit jelly. A bit of earthiness to the mix. Pretty interesting.","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
2002,"2011-07-12",4.6,"Fresh bottle courtesy of hopscotch, thank you! wow..... how....... whaaa......... i dunno what to say. this is insane how much this beer tastes like pb and j, and is still delicious and drinkable at the same time. incredible. pours a lighter brown with lots of mahogony and orange hues, sparse khaki head, doesnt last long or leave much lacing. smell is awesome, perfect blend of pb and j, and that goes for the taste as well, though more so in the nose cause there is less beer influence. great nose, but just unreal flavor, very, very authentic peanut butter and fruity jelly profile. in the jelly im getting concord grape, raspberry,  and lighter hints of strawberry and blueberry preserves. the peanut butter smells like a raw, gritty, less processed and more natural peanut butter, not jiffy or some bullshit.  the body is great, sweet, slight bitterness in the finish to round it out, full feel and oily texture, great carbonation that seems to release the flavor and then disappear in the back palate for a smooth drinker.  extra point overall for ingenuity and such a great success at such a hard flavor combo. shorts and southern tier could both learn a thing or two from these guys, and i mean that nicely since i love all three breweries beers. this beer is great, these guys have flavoring brews down pat, nicely balanced and very expressive at the same time. terrificly funky stuff from the buddha.","Notown, California, USA","wavers1"
2002,"2011-07-09",4.1,"Thanks to Casey for this... pours a nice dark amber brown, decent tan head... the nose is all roasted peanuts, salty, really great authentic peanuts, the jelly is hidden, dont get much but there is a sweet fruity note, smells great... the first is all roasted salty peanuts, its awesome, after that the taste dies down a bit, becomes a touch watery and dead on the finish, a touch of alcohol... really crushable the best pbj and beer Ive had, destroys Shorts version... for this type of beer, this is one of the best ones out there","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
2002,"2011-06-26",4.8,"Nose is amazing. Freshly ground peanut butter, hint of blueberry and cherry and light roasted malt. The color is sort of a reddish brown, quite dark. Flavor is like drinking a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. Though the beer is called No Crusts there is actually something of crusty bread in the flavor from the malt. Sweet but not overly so, this is perfection in a glass, the only way this could be better is if it were a fuller bodied beer, an imperial version but nothing over 10%. Maybe. My favorite Buddha Beer to date. Kevin and Ryan have done it again.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
2002,"2011-06-19",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2011 Wow! Finally a beer that really tastes like a PB&J! Incredible. Eat your hearts out Shorts. This is how its done!!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2002,"2011-06-11",5.0,"Clarity: Clear for being Dark 
Hue: Brownish/Red in color 
Nose: Ughh Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich (Peanuts, Fruit, Bread) 

No Crusts was released June 10th at the Funky Buddha in Boca Raton, FL. 

This is exactly what a Peanut Butter and Jelly Beer should taste like. The nose leads to strong peanut butter with a slight hint of fruit. The taste has a nice attack of Jelly then then followed by the attack of the peanuts. 

Unlike other beer that I have had with peanut flavoring, this beer doesnt lay around and linger on your palate. 

A true treat. 

While I wouldnt be able to drink a bunch of these in one sitting, I will say that there isnt a single thing I would change about this beer.","Florida, USA","dosbeerigos"
2002,"2011-06-10",4.6,"Simply amazing! The guys at the  Funky Buddha have done it again. Putting together a great combo of peanut butter and jelly. Brings  you right back to childhood. The aroma, the flavor, the  whole experience of drinking this beer is just great. Right up there with Maple Bacon.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
2002,"2011-06-09",4.6,"Wow, this beer is incredible. Murky brown with a thin tan head.  The nose is straight peanut butter and jelly, not sort of like peanut butter and jelly but full on stick your nose in a sandwich PB&J.  The mouth feel is full with gobs of fresh peanuts leading into a raspberry jam finish.  They hit this one dead on.","USA","Slimbrundage"
2002,"2011-06-09",4.5,"Draft - Deep murky brown, creamy off white head.  Thick warm gooey peanut butter aroma rides a soft current of raspberry jam throughout .  Reminds me of my kids favorite lunch as the flavor is truly dead on for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  A touch of sweet berry is expertly layered over the thick nuttiness from start to finish.  Medium bodied and smooth.  Unbelievable work of art...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
2002,"2011-06-07",4.4,"Draft This beer rocks! Murky, dark caramel ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. Smells just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Not sort of like a PB&J sandwich; exactly like a PB&J sandwich. Medium-bodied with a milky mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Tastes much like it smells  peanut butter, sweet preserves and a gentle kiss of acidity. Heavy on the peanut butter. Finishes fruity, nutty and lightly sweet. Ive tasted at least ten takes on a peanut butter or PB&J beer and this one, by far, is the most true to its aim. I didnt think something like this could be accomplished without artificial flavors or aromas. Spot-on, amazing brew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
