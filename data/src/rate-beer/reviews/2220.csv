2220,"2015-03-15",3.3,"On tap in 2014 at NakaMeguro Taproom. Cloudy amber color with an off-white head. Caramel, peach, fig, and malt aromas present. Taste is sweet and bitter. Well-balanced. Slightly bitter finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
2220,"2014-12-30",3.7,"Had this a few months ago. Pours red copper with a white head that reduces fast into a thin layer, leaving some lasting lacing on the way, looing like a knittingwork. Aroma has some fall fruits, rowan, cranberries. Sweet and some bitterness lurking underneath. Taste reveals abundant hopping, there is not only aroma but you can feel the fragrant bite of whole hops. Fruits are also there but they are bitter - rowan but not as mushy as rowans sometimes are. Aftertaste is clean, bitter. Beer is quite nicely balanced while maintaining complexity and multiple.layers. Long bitterness lingers in your mouth longer, just as if I had a handful of rowans straight from the tree. Autumn this is.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
2220,"2014-10-03",3.5,"Draught at Bungalow. Lovely dark amber colour, fine thin head. Aromas of caramel, burnt toffee and booze. Slightly sticky aftertaste, with that back-of-postage stamp flavour I love. Good depth and balance. Quite nice.","Kyoto, JAPAN","Westkyoto77"
2220,"2013-11-01",3.6,"On tap @ The Hangover, Nakano, Tokyo. Hazy, orange to red colored. Off white head. Aromas: caramel, sweet malts, fruity, piney. Additionally some herbal hoppiness retronasal. Flavor is moderate bitter and moderate sweet. Medium bodied. Finishes rather dry and with a herbal hopbitterness. Usually not a fan of red ales, this was pretty good.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","PotjeBier"
2220,"2013-10-19",3.7,"Draught at Tadgs. Fragrant, crushed peaches, even minty, nose. Hazy red-brown color. Juicy, rich maltiness / gets rounded and down into good balance. Medium body. Exceptional malt, good balance. Had this a few years ago at the source in Numazu, and its as good as ever. Go Reds!","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
2220,"2013-10-18",3.6,"A cloudy  muddy orange pour on tap at Tadgs. The aroma is a nice balance between hops & Malta. The taste is full bodied with a touch of chocolate/caramel malts but perfectly balanced with hops. Really easy drinking stuff.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
2220,"2011-10-30",3.6,"Keg at Harajuku taproom. Orange colored with frothy white head with small bubbles. Aroma is plenty of malt, bit bready, bit roasted and bit caramel. Taste gives plenty of the caramel in the smell, ultra malty. Bit spiky in the mouth. Nice.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
2220,"2011-10-16",3.3,"Fairly straight forward fest beer, ie malty lager, with the nice addition of some spicy and citric hop notes. Certainly not a hop monster, but a nice, clean american take on a classic.","JAPAN","jonno"
2220,"2010-11-02",3.5,"Draught at Bulldog World Beer Bar & Food. Clear dark amber - white head. Fruity hoppy. Berries. Fruity. Resin. Orange. Citrus. Medium malty. Light benzin. Nice.","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Theis"
2220,"2008-12-28",3.4,"Bottle.
Faint, but very hoppy nose, with medium amber malt, grass, plums, earthy  caramel. Deep amber color with a huge off-white head. Fruity, somewhat earthy flavor with medium hopping and caramel. Citrus hops. Finish is long-lasting bitter hops, with a touch of earthy malts and fruit lingering. Nice, though not as malty as I had hoped. Hops took over.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2220,"2007-11-13",3.6,"One of the many reasons I love Baird are the refrences to Cincinnati, Ohio.  Amber/copper with a thick, full, tan head.  Sweet malts, dough, fruits.  A little bit thin, nice carbonation.  Flavor is hoppier than expecting.  Citrus and fruity hops.  Biscuit malts, and a touch of sweetness.  Finishes with a nice hoppy bite.  I really enjoyed this brew, but I dont believe this is an Oktoberfest.  Its just way too hoppy and not nearly enough malt.  Still, id drink it again.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
2220,"2005-12-22",3.5,"Deep fall color with a surprisingly hoppy nose of apples, but a hint of bready maltiness is there. Thick malty start, but then transends into a bit of a hop bomb and a has a bitter finish. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for the style.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
