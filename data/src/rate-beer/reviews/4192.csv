Flot mahognifarvet norsk Dunkler Bock med mindre offwhite skumtop, 1-2 cm.
Syrlig og sødlig aroma af ristet malt. Noter af blomme, chokolade og en form for bondegårdsaroma. 
Virkelig god og dyb smag omend lidt vandet i konsistensen. Dejlig balance. En anelse syrlig i starten af smagsbilledet og derefter indtræder den gode balance mellem sødmen og det bitre. God smag fra den brændte/ristede malt. 
Middel krop og fin karbonering en anelse under middel giver en blød rar mundfølelse uden at være for flad. Konsistensen er som nævnt en anelse vandet uden at være for tynd.

4192,"2010-03-01",3.6,"Bottle from Vinmonopolet. Ive had this before, but since its been a while and I now have the policy of rating everything I drink, I thought it was time for a revisit. This is a classic bock from the Scandinavian tradition, and the only Norwegian beer to make it into Michael Jacksons classic ""500""-collection, since brewers like Nøgne Ø at the time of writing (2000) had yet to reach international acknowledgment. Pours a very deep coppery brown with a small, quickly disappearing head. To my disappointment, a metallic ""canned food""-smell which I mainly associate with over-aged lagers or commercial dunkels on can hits my nose immediately. Luckily, it disappears after a while, and my snifter fills up with lovely notes of nougat, raisins and a hint of red vinegar. Taste is caramel malt, raisins again, a hint of cherries and a fair amount of candy sugar. If it wasnt for the balancing sourness blending out all the sweets, itd be almost like a Belgian dubbel without the yeasty notes. Rather drinkable, and blended in a very nice way. Nothing formidable, but probably a good beer to drink with a variety of food. I liked this one.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
4192,"2010-02-07",3.3,"33cl bottle from Vinmonopolet. Best before 2010-06-11. This was the last on the list of best beers brewed in Norway I hadnt tried so it was about time I tried it. It poured a dark reddish brown colour with a medium big white creamy head that settled down fast in the glass. The aroma is sweet and bordering on sickeningly sweet. Very sweet malty aroma. Some hints of wood. The flavour is also sweet, but not so much as the aroma, thankfully. The sweet malts are dominant, but theres also notes of caramel and brown sugar as well. Short aftertaste. A decent beer overall, but more of a ticker beer than something Im going to look for later.","Kurland, NORWAY","espenra"

Medium-bodied; Sweet initial flavour with a metallic overtone and a pleasant malt backbone. Aftertaste shows a lot of the metallic character with a bit of the fruityness and a moderate amount of the sweetness. A bit too stagnant and musty for my tastes, but all-in-all, not a horrendous beer!

4192,"2001-11-22",3.8,"When I saw the green glass bottle I thought it odd that a bock beer would be packaged that way. Then when I opened the bottle I was disappointed with the aroma and thought the beer had gone skunky; but when I tasted it, wow! Delicious malty body with yeasty flavors reminiscent of home brew -but better. Lovely deep ruby color but the head was not long lasting. Quite strong but very flavorful and enjoyable. This is a good sipping beer for special occasions. Nice.","Maineville, Ohio, USA","Beer Guy99"

Ill rate this without looking at what I rated that, but they should be the same. It was a nice solid bock beer. I could drink this all night.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jstu9"

4192,"2001-03-21",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2005 Everything that Samuel Adams Triple Bock should have been. Rich pruneish nose. Tastes like a fine after-dinner brandy. Full bodied and rounded out with a roasted maltiness. Prescence and kick of the alcohol becomes apparent in the finish. Excellent! Give me some more of that Aass!!!","Lancaster, California, USA","weeicemon"

4192,"2001-02-12",3.4,"This beer tastes and smells like aass.    Ok now that I got that horrible pun out of the way...    This oh so bubbling lager has a clear amber colour and a somewhat creaming taste.    There is a nice little white head constantly on top of the brew.  The taste was somewhere between chocolate and apples with a roasted coffee finish. Green bottles are very cool and this bottle is no exception.    The shape is very neat.   One problem my Aass was slightly skunky due, no doubt, to the semi-transparent glass.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","lizziesage"
