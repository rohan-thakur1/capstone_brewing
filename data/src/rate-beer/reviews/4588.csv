4588,"2016-10-07",3.0,"A rather disappointing witbier given the ratings. It was just a bit musty tasting and while it had some citrus it lacked a brightness Id hope for. Not my favorite Japanese witbier by a long shot.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
4588,"2016-08-25",3.2,"A little darker than golden with little white head. Aroma is some bready malts, lots of yeasts, some fruit (maybe baked apple), cake, also some lettuce and clove. Taste is fresh fruity sour with some catchy artificial sweetness. Slightly syrupy, with medium carbonation, that fits well into the picture. No real finish. Overall a bit above average.","GERMANY","Ritzn"
4588,"2015-11-27",3.8,"Pours whitish yellow with fluffy white head, quite a lot of yeast. Aromas are fruity, orange peel, bread, fresh spiciness. Flavors quite nicely feature the malt, with a pleasantly balanced breadiness under light fruity sourness. Very easy to drink, and possibly one of my favorite witbiers. Not a weiss though, so the name is weird.","Kumamoto, JAPAN","jdjuice"
4588,"2015-11-03",3.6,"Bottle from Tanakaya. Pours a glowing straw color with a huge soapy white head. Classic wit aromas with banana and clove on the front with a touch of lemon zest. Taste is sweet, but has a slight tart edge to it. Creamy mouthfeel. Pretty good Hoegaarden clone. Would definitely drink again.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
4588,"2015-09-30",3.5,"Draught at Isetan. Creamy banana, orange peel, bready mouthfeel, grassy notes, dry peppery finish. Decent but seems quite overhyped for me, maybe I just prefer the German style.","","biirusaikou"
4588,"2015-08-30",3.8,"Bottle. Big aroma of cream and wheat, only light bananas and spice, maybe a bit more Belgian. Taste is good. Crisp, little bit of grainy sweetness, vanilla ice cream, bit of spritz, crisp finish. Nice mix of white beer styles.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
4588,"2015-06-08",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2016 L: poured from the bottle into two glasses, the first which was a pale clearish gold with minimal head, the second which was a lovely cloudy gold with fluffy white head. 
S: lots of wheat and spice.
T: very crisp, plenty of wheat, a nice spicy fizz. A bit of lemon coming through too.
M: the spice spreads over the palate with a lovely dry finish. Spot on, so smooth to drink. 
O: very nice wit/weizen?","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"
4588,"2015-04-18",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2015 Can, thanks to TimE, 04/18/2015. Pours a cloudy orange gold color, fizzy white head, decent retention after fading to the surface. Aroma is ripe banana with clove, fresh baked wheat bread. Taste is zesty lemon with spicy, herbal bitterness and wheat. Light, round effervescent body, surprising depth refreshing. Not my favorite style, but well done and quite enjoyable nonetheless. Quaffable, tasty brew.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
4588,"2015-02-21",3.8,"On tap at Bungalow. Hideji Hana no White Weiss

Belgian Wit 4.5% a cloudy light gold with a foamy bright white head. Fruity cloves and wheat aroma. The taste is bang on spicy Weizen. More Weizen than witbier as I dont get much citrus peel from it, perhaps a touch of lemon. Frikin delicious with a soft mouthfeel though. Cloves/cinnamon goodness. The best Hideji beer Ive had by far.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
4588,"2013-04-17",4.2,"Draught at Bungalow. Very nice aroma. Perfect amount of sweetness. A little rough on the finish. Overall I love it.","JAPAN","HKAndy"
4588,"2012-04-03",3.5,"Tap. Low carbonation. Very oliy for a weizen, but was highly drinkable. Banana was low key - some grass, spice and clove. Well done from a very good brewery.","JAPAN","jonno"
4588,"2010-06-28",3.5,"Bottle from Yamaoka. Deep gold, very cloudy with a low, lacy head. Fragrant, estery aroma with banana, spices (cloves and coriander) rich malts, bread. Bready flavor, somewhat creamy, with banana, clove, light citrus. Belgian yeast but the esters also seem a bit Bavarian. Slight hops at the finish. Complex and clean. Restrained in its additives. Very nice at first, though it became less interesting over time, getting a bit watery and dull. Drink it well chilled and quickly.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
4588,"2008-07-21",4.0,"Bottle from trade with TimE.  Best by Jun 1st, 2008.  Slightly cloudy, yellow color.  Big fluffy white head.  Sweetish.  No bitterness.  Low aroma. Very easy to drink.  My wife likes it a lot, but her mother didn’t.  One of my favorites from this trip to Japan.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
4588,"2008-05-13",4.0,"Tap at Bulldog. Perfectly white chalk head sits on top of a nose with oranges and cloves. The body is light, slightly acidic, refreshing and smooth. Perfect for the style. Refreshing clovely finish. Highly highly enjoyable.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
4588,"2008-04-07",4.1,"Bottle from Tanakaya shop in Tokyo.  Ooh, this ones terrific!  Very very much like a Hoegaarden - almost indistinguishable.  Light on the spices.  Some coriander notes.  Citrusy.  Refreshing.  Moderate to light body.  Again, its a Hoegaarden clone, just yellower in color.  The aromas terrific!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
