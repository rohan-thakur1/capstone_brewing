Malty sweet base along with flavors of brown sugar; gingerbread comes to mind. Hops provide some spice and underlying bitterness, but the strong spicy character dominates. This is liquid pumpkin pie with a kick. Absolutely love it, but $95 dollars a case?","Parkesburg, Pennsylvania, USA","cwill"

50,"2014-04-15",4.8,"The light copper color appeared a bit more pale than the bottled version of regular Punking, but darker than the on-tap version of regular Pumking. The offering had little head. The nose was extraordinary - vanilla and spice dominate.

The taste is a bit more balanced than the regular version. I love Pumking, but I understand that many feel the beer is cloying or syrupy. If you feel that way, you should try the oak-aged version. It does temper the sweetness of the regular version.

Truth-be-told, the oak adds little of its own flavor, it but it does VERY well at balancing what is already present.","","57md"

Theres quite a bit going on taste-wise, though the pumpkin flavor is muted. Instead, theres a good deal of oak up front,, plus coriander, cardamon, basil, more vanilla, some white pepper, and an aftertaste that reminds me of being sick and spoon-fed benadryl or old cough syrup.","Anaheim, California, USA","anaheim1983"

50,"2012-10-27",3.9,"Draft from a 2010 keg at Brouwerij lane.  Same incredible aroma and taste as the regular pumking but with a stronger bit of malts and hops.","New York, USA","Maverick34"
50,"2012-09-19",4.6,"Oak aging is something you tend to associate with imperial stouts, but Southern Tier has shown that can work well with other styles such as barleywines, imperials IPAs, and pumpkin ales. Their famous ""Pumking"" beer is one of the most highly acclaimed brews of the style, and theyve managed to offer a new version by oak aging it in 2011 for a tap-only release. While its only slightly different than the original version, its still a fantastic beer in its own right.

I got a 16oz growler fill of a 2011keg from Westmere Beverage. I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Light orange/dark gold color. Mostly clear but with just a bit of haze. Forms a small head with a vigorous pour, which mostly evaporates but does leave some lacing on the glass.

Taste: Southern Tier Pumking has often been described as liquid pumpkin pie and Id agree with that for sure, although its a beer that seems to focus more on the crust than the pie filling itself. Graham cracker crust is the most familiar taste found in the palate here. Its a delicious combination of cinnamon, nutmeg and pureed pumpkin that dominate and drive the palate. Its lightly bitter up front with a quick taste of cinnamon followed by pumpkin and a smooth sweetness of vanilla from the oak not found in the traditional bottle and tap versions. It finishes with the sweet and spicy mix of cinnamon and nutmeg and the graham cracker flavor. Even the aftertaste is pleasant - not crisp and clean, but not cloying or dry either. Not a trace of alcohol anywhere in the palate. Amazing and delicious. 

Drinkability: Id give Southern Tier Oak Aged Pumking a high score due to the palate alone, but its the smooth drinkability that clinches it for me. The mouthfeel is perfect as its not overly effervescent, but not thin and tepid either. Theres a slightly creamy texture despite the lack of head (in this case probably due to the oak aging). Its actually not that big of a beer at 8.6% ABV, although it definitely has the robustness of such . A perfect beer to pair with pumpkin pie or enjoy as a dessert in a glass.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Medium bodied with a subtle dry oak barrel presence that slightly tames the sweetness yet its still bursting with sweet pumpkin pie and autumnal spices.  Pumpkin, clove, ginger, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon and allspice.

50,"2012-01-30",3.7,"Tap at Gingerman in NYC. Pours impossibly clear gold with a small, white head. Medium lace. Full pumpkin pie nose with an emphasis on buttery crust and creamy dessert. Rich and clean. No off character. Taste is a bit plasticy and dull moving to that characteristic pumpkin pie and buttery crust insanity known in the regular Pumking. Super rich dessert profile. Yeah, its a one trick pony but if you love pumpkin pie this is the most intense beer of the style. Not a lot of finesse like Cigar City Good Gourd; more of smack in the face. Palate is rich and buttery yet effervescent and clean playing with your mind...diacetyl or no? I think its an illusion from so much sugar content and coating mouthfeel. Heavier body than an imperial stout. Huge dessert heaviness is counteracted by quite a bit of leafy hops and lavender soap. Cant really place ""oak"" in here but I like it. Just know what to expect: liquid pumpkin pie.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
