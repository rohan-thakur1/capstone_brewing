Flavor is more mild, some sweet coconut cake, low caramel, flan, not too sticky. Quite nice and really not over the top and certainly not too sweet or boozy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

4152,"2014-08-31",3.8,"Bottle 12 fl oz at Sweet & Sour, Sätila, 2014-08-30. Thanks to _angst_! Marked 12% ABV, but feels a whole lot more like the RB stated 16%!The name makes it sound absolutetly disgusting, but tried to sample and rate it with an open mind still.Clear deep golden color, no head. Sweet, alcohol, citrus, coconut flakes scent, toasted coconut and bread crust. Sweet, alcohol, honey, coconut taste. Alcohol aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel, no bitterness. A bit like the drinking version of the chocolate bar Bounty. Way better than I expected it to be by the name, still way too boozy and goes more to candy bar than drinking mead for me.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
4152,"2014-08-30",3.5,"Bottle, pours clear orange amber. Aroma is caramel sweet coconut. Flavor is as aroma, maybe too sweet and too much coconut... kind of drinking sun tan lotion.","SWEDEN","tkrjukoff"
4152,"2014-08-30",4.1,"Bottle received in trade. Thank you lionsandbeer! US rating 1000! Pours deep golden with no head and subtle legs. Smell is sweet with honey, coconut milk, caramel, alcohol, milk chocolate, coconut liqueur, hay and toasted coconut. Taste is sweet with honey, caramel, county bar, alcohol, hay, milk chocolate, pineapple and amaretto. Mouthfeel is round, slightly sticky sweet, tiny watery, boozy and medium bodied. Finish is sweet with honey, caramel, coconut milk, hay, bounty bar, alcohol and hints of toast coconut and charred wood. Really really sweet which works with the components. Bit too boozy and a tad bit too light in the body perhaps.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

4152,"2013-07-23",4.4,"Brought by Patty to Northdown. Thanks Patty! Toasted marshmallow in color and completely still. Nose is similar to a flan in my opinion, with a lot of vanilla and caramel and very little coconut. Flavor starts out sweet and falls back on more vanilla and caramel. Again, very little coconut. Light mouthfeel, no carbonation, and a moderate finish. One of my favorite kuhnhenns to date, would love a bottle of this for myself.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
4152,"2013-06-09",4.3,"Holy smokes, this mead was great, thanks ICEatALAMO for the nip size bottle from last year, poured a darker yellow color with aromas of caramel, coconut, honey, and light booze.  Flavors were a mixture of all three, almost like a caramel butterscotch with some coconut and honey soaked with some light booze.  Damn this mead was fantastic, only regret was sharing this one with gilliard, not that hes a bad guy, or that he loved it too, but I wanted the whole nip bottle to my self after the first sip.","Florida, USA","burg326"
4152,"2013-05-27",3.5,"Bottle purchased at Kuhnhenn. Clear amber with no head and no legs. Aroma of coconut, caramel and honey. Coconunt and honey flavor before a semi-sweet caramel finish. Not bad, but I expected it to be sweeter and more flavorful.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
4152,"2013-02-08",4.0,"Nip sized bottle. Label labeled batch 021208. Poured a clear golden color with no head. Aromas of lots of coconut, some vanilla, and some caramel - but lots of coconut. Tastes of caramel (more than in the aromas), coconut, vanilla, and honey sweetness. Again, not a mead or coconut fan, but this one is pretty damn good.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
4152,"2013-02-08",4.3,"Small ass 6oz botle via trade. Poured a nice looking syrupy brownish amber with no head. Aroma is great, loads of toasted coconut over top caramel topped green apples along with some syrup notes. Body is probably about as good as a mead can be, medium and syrupy with a faint hint of carbonation even though there is none, slight heat from the 16%. Flavor is like the aroma with the caramel coming in first followed by rasoted coconut and toast along with some lime and tropical fruits. Really interesting and great stuff.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

Split with Simon, compliments of Steve..huge thanks for trading me this guy. Pours a orange tinted mahogany with no head or lacing. Aromas/flavor would reduce any man to cream his jeans. Insane notes of fresh coconut shavings, coconut water ice, caramel vanilla sundae, wood, tons of fresh coconut juice, caramel, earthy honey, nuts, flowers, toasted coconut, macaroons from terminis down on 8th street. Holy fuck, this one will be near impossible to top. Smooth as silk, medium to fuller bodied mead with barely any alc. present. Straight Retarded.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4152,"2012-08-11",4.6,"2010 bottle.  Crap this was amazing.  Caramel color flat pour.  Nose of honey, coconut, vanilla, and candy.  Taste follows the nose and is balanced absolutely perfectly.  Be ready for possible insulin shock.

4152,"2012-05-04",4.0,"Bottle. Batch 021208. 6oz bottle. Pours a clear orange color. The coconut aroma is pretty strong up front with some caramel notes. Smells a littel boozy too but at 16%, I guess that is bound to happen. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Whoa, this is a touch hot but the flavors are really nice. The coconut and caramel provide a nice upfront sweetness which is then followed by an alcohol note. Ends with a lingering coconut flavor.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
4152,"2012-02-22",3.8,"pours a light caramel copper color that is perfectly still and clear.

Full-bodied and oily with no carbonation. The flavor supplies loads of sweet banana, caramel, coconut and clean honey. Sugary, rich, coconut and raw honey finish. Awesome!

4152,"2011-09-22",4.5,"This beer is just silly good. Admittedly it was engineered especially for me since I love Caramel AND Coconut. Nose is huge with both caramel and sweet coconut.

4152,"2011-07-30",4.2,"Bottle shared with friends and with plenty left over between 7 people. I guess I was the only one with a sweet tooth that night! Pours an fitting caramel color and definitely smells sweet. Notes of coconut, intense caramel sugar are easy to detect, but it was a bit Malibu-like and like a ""Florida beach"" as James put it. On the tongue, I got light coconut, vanilla, tons of slick honey and cake frosting. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but still drank well.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","sarro"
4152,"2011-07-17",2.7,"Bottle shared by Kyle, thanks! Poured a clear creamy caramel brown with no head whatsoever. Aroma was full of coconut with a bit of caramel and some alcohol.

4152,"2011-07-03",4.3,"Bottle shared by BenC - Pours amber and clear...still. Wow...that is definitely coconut and caramel on the nose. Almost macaroon-like. Its smooth and sweet, without really and trace of the honey. Yum. Taste is roughly the same, with a little bit of baking spice and honey on the finish. Smooth and a bit watery. Fantastic.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
4152,"2011-06-24",3.8,"Kuhnhenn coconut cream mead. Nip bottle thanks to pudds... Pours a  
mostly clear, somewhat opaque, amber pour with clearly no head.  
Extenuating legs dancing io the edges... Coconut and caramel nose, not  
overwhelmingy so like the coconut curry. Caramel is more overt in  
nature.Honey backing... Flavors are coconutty in nature a little
More caramel in nature while still maintaining a sweet honey backing.  
A little booziness persisting midway through and towards the back.  
Clean and enjoyable along the desert mead perspective.

4152,"2011-06-11",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2011 Small bottle shared by Kan. Thanks a ton!! Pours a ridiculous glowing amber pour, darker edged with touches of brown. A huge glow with touches of glow. No real head. Aromas are a ridiculously rich coconut essence, touches of sweet cream, with vanilla, coconut oil, and sweet honey mead. Sweet, huge coconut presence. Initial sweeter edged, huge coconut presence paired with a touch lighter honey, vanilla, wet oak. Touches of vanilla, but honey and coconut come back into play hard. Middle shows a touch of tartness, then strictly is big coconut. Cream, huge coconut fat, and the honey aids it. Kuhnhenns strength is pumping huge flavor into highly flavorful beveraged. Great beverage, highly flavorful. Albeit, Im not a huge coconut fan. This is interesting, but falls a bit south for me. Still, I liked it much more than I thought I would.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Aroma of exactly what its described as - caramel coconut creme. Smells like tanning lotion and a tropical drink, reminds one of the Caribbean or a Mexican beach vacation. Taste is of course sweet and incredibly delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, goes down so easily. Utterly delicious, one of the greatest things Ive ever smelled and tasted.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","mattmc1973"
