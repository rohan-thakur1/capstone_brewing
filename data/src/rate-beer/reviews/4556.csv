4556,"2013-11-26",4.3,"330 ml bottle bought at YATA in Grand Century Place, Mong Kok.
Appearance: Clear, light dull golden colour with thin trace of yeast particles; two finger head and lasting crumpety white foam stays on top throughout this session. Excellent sticky lacing with very fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant full malt, with IPA- like fresh grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, honey, canned fruits, pine, bread and faint grass.

Taste: Medium sweet full lager malt, with passion fruit, grapefruit, citrus, molasses, pine, bread, light yeast, liquorices, strong lime and grass.

Body: Full body, thick and oily palate.

Mouth Feel: All malt with full on NZ hoppy attack - refreshing passion fruits, grapefruit zest, nice citrus, and hop oilyness. Yummy! Fat maltiness and bready. Sweetness is strong but is nicely-balanced by sharp liquorices and herbal hops. At times this tastes more like a full on IPA! Wow!

Hoppiness: Very fragrant tropical fruits, grapefruits, pine and lime in nose and taste, hop-oily palate, and a sharp Czech-Pils like bitterness for a nice and lasting finishing.

After Taste: Dry, fruity and nicely bitter to mouth.

Comments: Call it a bastard Czech Pils if you like, but I really dig the brewers creativity and innovation to freshen up a traditional type with all these NZ hops. The result is fully on tropical fruitiness and thickness, while preserving the goodness of Czech Pils richness and astringency. Enjoyable from start to finish.

4556,"2013-08-18",2.6,"My Bottom Line:
Lax bready malts and bitter hop spiciness ride this brews unrefined mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the cloudy beige blond.
-Carbonation is quite high, which in this case seems to increase the level of roughness.
-The aroma is timid without any clear hop or malt expression.
-A touch of diacetyl seems to be tied to the flavor profile.
-This bottle was flabby at best; no brightness at all, no crispness either. Definitely tastes like its past its best, but how was I supposed to tell without a date to be found on the bottle?

Aroma: The nose is a little grassy, with some lemon zest, bready malts, and floral notes

Flavor: Tastes a little sweet, with some clean pale malts, bread, and a grassy/floral hop bitterness

Palate: The body is light-medium, it drinks kinda clean, with lively carbonation, and a light dryness

This one is a solid Pils, but it isnt crisp and clean enough to be a top example of what I really look for in this style.  Still though, theres some nice stuff here and the malts and the hops work well together.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

4556,"2012-10-31",4.2,"A delightfully quaffable devil of a brew this one turned out to be and yet another tick on the board of lagers coming out of the micros of NZ at the moment. It produced up a satin sheened, yellow gold, just off bright, with high effervescence and a compact, tight white crown. Juicy, fruity burst wafts from the glass reminiscent of passionfruit, pineapple, lychee and sauvignon wine with underlying notes of pine needs, black pepper and rose petals. Soft, creamy mouthfeel with just a little spritz upfront. Light, well rounded and wonderfully hoppy throughout with just enough malt flavour to let its presence known. Spicy, floral, herbal and piney backend with a lasting bitterness to the swallow. Juicy fruit esters, like in the aroma, are the star here though. It is notably vinous with a quenching citrus tang and sourness, and supple passion/pine/lychee blend that linger long in amongst the herbal and floral hops. These Motueka Saaz hops are fantastic and this beer brilliantly showcases them. I loved this one. Everything works so harmoniously. This is one to definitely hunt down again.

Light lagers and pilsners are one of the most consistently underappreciated styles by beer geeks. Such appears to be the case here as well, because this is a wonderfully vibrant example of the style. Although, its fair to say that my experience may be quite different from a sample obtained at the source; this thing is seven months beyond the BB date, after all. For this style, normally that would yield a dull sample at best.  But this is anything but dull. Whereas this may have been more brightly hoppy when fresh, the bottle conditioning is presumably responsible for producing some delightful tropical esters. Not that such notes are all that typical for the style, but theyre certainly welcome. Would love to try this fresh.

Restrained malts, lots of citrus. Finish is a little short - its bitter, but insubstantial. Fresh and lovely. [3.7]Bottle. Very pale gold with a very white head that lasts pretty well. Floral, light bread, bright lemon. Light-bodied, fairly high carbonation. Light bready malt, firm bitterness with lemons and some pepper. Well inside the fine Kiwi lager camp.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

Lots of grassy saaz in the aroma, with spicy and subtle sweet floral, grape and passionfruit notes.
Classic pilsener taste with light bready and grainy malt. Not much hops flavour, but a full-on metallic bitterness hits you in the face.
Light body, moderately high carbonation - good for the style.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"

Flavor is also malty and is more of the same.  Light bodied, crisp from the active carbonation.  Very good for the style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

4556,"2009-04-22",3.6,"This has just replaced Emersons Pilsner as my ""go to"" Pils. Its certainly far more faithful to the style. The only slight issue is a tropical note to the hopping which seems out of place in a Pilsner. Still a delicious beer though, and one I will be drinking much more of.","Hamilton, NEW ZEALAND","greig"

Nose has loads of tropical and citruss fruits with an underlying grassy, spicy hop character. Palate is more or less the same, pils malt adds a fraction of sweetness before hops take charge to deliver a spicy/tangy finish. Manages to maintain clean and crisp despite the overt fruitiness.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Chrism86"

Fruity at the same time, mainly passionfruit, but also very malty which balances quite nicely. The finish is malty and bitter, and quite long.

4556,"2008-08-21",3.6,"Fruity hop aroma - berries and passionfruit. Light, white head and clear, straw colour. passionfuit, melon and berry flavours dominate, but with the malt background just coming through to balance the hop flavour. A firm bitterness to finish, with lingering berries and a little grassy after-taste. Very drinkable.","NEW ZEALAND","Alasdair"

Citrus and berry hop aroma, but also sweet like passion fruit with a hint of Pinot Gris. A very balanced body with clean crisp bitterness and a lingering hop flavour same as the aroma. 
I would be surprised if the flavour was really coming solely from Czech hops though and suspect that NZ Saaz B and D have been slipped in there at some stage... Still a fine drop!","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","bmackenzie"

Pale gold, slight haze, with a white, lingering, head and a light carbonation.  Superbly fresh nose that holds its own through the entire glass.  A real treat of passionfruit, lemon, spicey floral notes and hints of the fruity honey-like aroma of a german riesling.  Up there with Emersons Pilsner, though a touch more subtle.  Good flavour, though just a touch light in the juicy sweet pilsner malt department, shows though a decent spicey hop flavour and a shortish bitter finish. Crisp and fresh.  Smooth carbonation and light-medium weight.  More malt sweetness showing through and this would be one of the best.

4556,"2004-10-31",3.6,"My appreciation of Kiwi pilseners is somewhat affected by the brilliance of Emersons. This one is a fine specimen though, and it reminds me more of the Budvar (stick Czechvar up your fundiment A-B) in that I find this softer and more subtle in hop profile. A great looking beer with a typically expected golden hue and clean head. The beer is well balanced and has all of the qualities of a beer that is difficult to get right. NZ water goes a long way to helping with the subtlety and quality of the beer. Ta Beer_Ledgend.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"
4556,"2004-06-14",3.3,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2005 Quite pale for a Czech-style Pils without the golden colour from the long boil. OK head. Great aroma - very fresh, juicy malt with more fresh passionfruity hops and perhaps a bit of wort. Really nice, and like something but I cant think what it is. Initially tastes just like it smells - really fruity and juicy - but kind of falls away mid-palate, lacking the firm body of many Czech Pils. Finishes pretty strong, not overly bitter but has a nice crisp hoppiness to it. Slight astringency at the end. Thanks to beer_ledgend for this one!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"
