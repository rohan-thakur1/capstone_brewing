1164,"2014-03-01",3.8,"> Rather ordinary tropical DIPA rocketed to fame by Alpine cultists
[ Tap ][ Alpine ][ 16oz x2 ][ American Pint ][ $8? ][ 2/28/14 ]
>> Super fresh tap, first to order at the bar, brand new keg. Pours a chill haze orange golden with medium rocky head with decent formation, quick retention, and scant but webby lacing. Nose is rich jackfruit, soft mango, fairly tropical but not the most assertive. Taste is bone dry, making it a tad papery on the palate with the hop content. Still, the flavor is pithy, squashy, fresh melon. Pretty ordinary. Higher boost. Nice butterscotch nose as it warms. Overall, another circle jerk style Alpine cult beer.

Big fruity Nelson hops up front a touch of spruce, a little sweet malt backbone (more than regular Nelson), just enough for a beer this strong. Flavor follows suit, no surprises, nor crazy complex--just a fruity Nelson dominated double IPA that is executed perfectly in my mind. Not really much bitterness (peaked at a 3--again, just how I like it), dry finish with just a little alcohol presence.
