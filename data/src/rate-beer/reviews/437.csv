437,"2017-01-01",4.8,"On tap at DDC St-Jerome. This is my favorite beer from the many DDC beers Ive tasted so far. The lovely nitro foam, the sweet (rosted) malt, light caramelized taste. I have to honestly reveal Im enjoying that beer in a larger size glass than my regular one and Im almost jumping in the air when I see this beer written on the board as being available on the premises.

The taste is ... okay - very sweet, with a sharp pungency to the malt I usually associate with extract brews (this is NOT extract-brewed) - it left a tangy residue on my tongue, almost battery-licking zingy, which actually helped downplay the almost confectioners sugar sweetness - there might even be a hint of floral bitterness hovering about the edges, but the jurys out on that.

A dull orange-copper with rusty reddish highlights in the body.  Aroma of plant roots, soily and vegetal like, though not in the bad sense of the word, just smells like plant stalks cut open, some leafiness; a romp through a lush, wet forest.  Kind of reminds me of an English nitro bitter, perhaps Tetleys.  Somewhat dull and lightly watery.  Hints of light sugariness as well.  Quite dulled, overall, from the nitrogen.  Flavor is more watery grains, light soiliness and a hint of nutty bitterness.  Floral notes, herbs and plants.  Soft hops, not tremendously fruity, with a slight tinge of caramel and light toasted grains.  Thick, somewhat heavy body is quite full of water, but I feel its more the nitro talking than the beer.  Low carbonation, quite dry and with a dull mouthfeel, watery texture.

437,"2003-11-27",3.0,"brownish red colour.  soft and malty with some orange and caramel notes, but overall not a mind blower.  too bad because these guys make some stellar beers.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mrkimchee"
437,"2003-10-06",2.8,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2005 Re-Rate RBSG 2005. Dark amber body, good sized white head. Sweet aroma, touch of something muted fruit. Flavour is likewise, just a touch of bitterness. Meh. Adequately executed example of a style I dont really care for, average. <P> Heard in conversation:?: I liked the blonde and the triple. R: I thought you said Id date the blonde or the cripple!W: Yeah, shes not gonna run her ass away.
<P>Original Rating October 2003. Light amber colour. Good fluffy head and great lacing. Bit of malt. Hints of earthy notes. Nice but lacklustre. 5/3/5/3/12","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
437,"2003-10-01",2.7,"(Draught) Pours a medium, white head and an amber body. Slight roasted malt nose but not much there? A milky malt flavour. Average.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
437,"2003-09-23",2.9,"Little aroma to speak of although to be fair, there were perhaps a lot of smokers present at the time of tasting. Pale amber colour with nice light frothy head. Some roastiness in the flavour with ealy caramel sweetness and quite a bitter finish. Somewhat light in body although heavily carbonated. Worth another try - perhaps earlier in the day when the room is less smoky. On tap.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
437,"2003-03-31",3.0,"Reddish, copper, thick creamy head. It did look very decently. Aroma was mostly alcoholic; if anything rest was well hidden. Very intensive, with its own style. I found this beer to be nicely balanced only that aroma ...)","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
437,"2003-03-31",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2005 March 2003, sample:  Indistinct vaporous nose.  Creamy-looking, red-orange hue, awesomely malty and creamy on the tongue but not much complexity; caramel-vanilla. 4/3/7/3/12 2.9
July 2005, RBSG, full pint, nitro:  super-smooth and creamy, lovely pale malt body, maple swirled with faint dry hops, milky mouthfeel and a hint of lactic quality.  Well above-average for style.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

437,"2002-12-16",2.6,"About the only thing Irish Cream Ale about this beer is that it is served out of a nitro tap.  It lacks balance, having a big bittering hop backbone and little malt to balance. Not much else in terms of the malt or hop profile to speak of.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
