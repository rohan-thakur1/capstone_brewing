3873,"2016-05-02",3.8,"Bottled 3/16/16, drunk 4/12/16.Lovely pour as usual from MBC. Good clarity, slight chill-haze and a golden-copper body with a full white head atop.Quite ""dry"" in the nose, with some tropical character obviously showing from the mosaic, adding pineapple and light nectarine. The C-hops go to work, quickly adding grapefruit and dry pine, but its not aggressive; not too much anyways. The fruitiness is enough to keep my interest, while the malts in the background add light toasted character and strong honey and almond.In the mouth, its surprisingly less muddled/raw/aggressive than expected. Its MBC, so youre definitely going to get a fair share of bitterness and pine, but theres a good deal of playful tropical fruit, as well as staunch sweetness from the malt to balance. Very tight carbonation helps aid drinkability and clears the finish, as tangerine, pine, lemon and pineapple lingers. Im fully in the camp of the New England IPA, which this is not, but it has a lot of similarities and I can certainly see the appeal that this offers to those still seeking a healthy dose of bitterness and C-hops.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3873,"2016-04-18",4.0,"Bottled 03/16/16, so about 30 days old. Pours remarkably clear yellow for a Maine beer, big sudsy white head. Aroma is tropical fruit, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, some dankness, peach. Really nice robust tropical notes. Flavor is dank, pineapple, grapefruit, orange. Not as tropical as the Aroma. Feels like more mosaic in the nose, Nelson in the flavor. Mouthfeel is that nice creamy but still the right amount of effervescence that so many Maine Beers seem to have. Its exceptional. Typical of Maine Beer Co.","New York, USA","SG111"
3873,"2016-04-14",4.4,"Hotel beer, dont judge my plastic ware. Bottling date of 31616.
Anyhow, well, the appearance was a hazy golden bronzed orange color with a thin white layer of foaminess. No lacing. 
The smell had started off with some sweet citrus and bitter grapefruit rind. Light sweet onion dankiness strolling in underneath.
The flavor copies the smell pretty much the same. Light sweet danky onion and citrus aftertaste. Semi-smooth sweet finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent ssessionably low carbonated smooth feel. 
Overall, great AIPA, definitely would have again!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
3873,"2016-04-11",4.2,"On tap at the tasting room in Maine. Pours clear golden, small white head that leaves behind some lacing. Some catty dank hops mostly from mosaic. Remind me one time to write a 1,000 word diatribe about how mosaic hops are the antichrist and the most overrated hop variety today. But I digress, some mild bitterness leads to a short but robust finish. Mild dryness. Light to medium body.","Saint Johns, Florida, USA","UDBeernut"
3873,"2016-04-10",4.3,"500 ml bottle from Root Cellar. Last one! Bottled 3/16/16.

Aroma of herbs, pineapple, melon, lemon zest, pepper, sweet bread, pine, grapefruit peel, and grass. Flavor of orange, grapefruit, and lemon citrus, pale and bready malts, grass, tea, hay, melon, and papaya. Light-medium bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a smooth, balanced mouthfeel. Outstanding IPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3873,"2016-04-06",4.1,"Brimming gold pour, nice head. Extremely fresh dry-hop nose of resinous green oil, earthy pine, hollow & sugary pineapple and mango, delicate floral notes. Flavor is bright and complex, malleable ripe tropical notes down below, unique earthy Mosaic pine, violet flowers, light minerality, crushable body and easy linger. Very nice. Familiar flavors, but nicely balanced and vibrant. Always love how delicate and detailed Maines brews are (when theyre not TOO delicate and reserved). Liked this one much better than Lunch.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","mambossa"
3873,"2016-04-04",3.7,"500ml bottle in a tulip. Pours golden with a white head. Aroma of floral and citrusy and lightly garlic-y hops, some pale malts, and some dough. Flavor the same with a decent hoppiness but mosaic arent for me. Average texture. A decent IPA.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"

3873,"2015-12-17",4.1,"Pours a clear bright yellow with a thick white head...great lacing and retention. Aroma delicately runs the gamut of hop notes with lots of fruit...pineapple, tangerine, other citrus and some stonefruit...and also some really nice herbal and grassy notes. The flavor is less fruity and even more herbal/grassy...very fresh and floral...light rindy bitterness. Mouthfeel is light / medium and silky with a dry rindy/grassy/herbal hoppy finish that lingers to almost a bit resinous. Really nails lots of different hop characteristics.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
3873,"2015-12-14",4.2,"Opens up immediately with an aroma of piney and dank hoppiness, and the flavor follows on with more of the same.

Aroma is wonderfully hoppy, with loads of piney hops and maybe a touch of citrus tang. Flavour is along the same lines, with piney and floral hops, with a very minor citrus tang. The floral hops are prominent, with an almost soapy, perfumey quality, but in a great way. Just enough cereal malt to back, with an ever so slight sweetness that creeps in after a while.
