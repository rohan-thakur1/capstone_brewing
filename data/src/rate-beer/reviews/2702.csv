2702,"2017-01-23",2.8,"What a waste. A black tiny beer with a biscotti head. So thick with alcoholic malt syrup, it really kicks your ass sideways from all 8 directions. I cant find the coffee. Just a lot of dark fruit, alcoholic syrup.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"

2702,"2016-12-27",4.0,"On tap @ Beer Revolution. Black as can be with a thin mocha head. This is certainly an intense beverage. Espresso, bourbon, vanilla, and fudge. Woah. Big time barrel character and a whole lot of intense coffee aroma and flavor. Get some nice nutty and spicy qualities from this as well. Maybe a hint of charred oak. Really a big beer, but I enjoy it.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2702,"2016-12-17",3.8,"Draft 9 oz pour at Eureka! Talk about a one and done type of beer. Pours jet black with almost no head. Extremely potent, boozy vanilla and mocha aroma. Flavor is equally as boozy, if not more, with a blast of rich chocolate, massive bourbon impression, raisin, coffee, and vanilla. Dark fruit and bourbon linger. Heavy hitter here. Dough malts. Id guess a higher abv. I can feel my eyes drying with every sip. Creamy. Love the chocolate flavors going on. Big league beer here. A ton of good things going on with this, but its a beer I really need to be in the mood for to truly respect it for what it is. On the extra plus side, its 28° outside, and it feels like nothing after this beer that was brewed where its likely at least twice as warm. A beer that seems most appropriate possibly tomorrow morning when there is a decent chance my football team will be throwing in the towel with 2 games left. This setting was still good. Potent, heavy, thick, but still delicious. What a beer!","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

Theres a fruit flavor that could be a bit towards ""un-sweet"". Tart and sour dont work, but ...Not close to dry, but far from sweet. Really super good.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

Black with brown highlights and brown head. Beautiful rich malt is the main player. Layers with vanilla and whiskey. Moderate alcohol warmth.

2702,"2016-07-10",3.6,"10 ounce sample on tap at The Davis Beer Shoppe. I am quite surprised they have this crazy rare beer on tap. I think there were only 600 bottles made. The aroma has lots of vanilla and bourbon character present. Some underlying minerals and chalkiness is also detected. Inky black body with a small, light brown head. Good lacing. Starts with some sweet vanilla bourbon flavors. Some astringent tartness is also present. Cocoa and dry powered chocolate flavors come through to the finish. Ethanol is well-hidden. Lots of chocolate. Very decadent.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
