Dark orangy brown color, not much head or lace, though I poured slow as I was splitting between 2 glasses. Sweet flavor. Medium body, smooth creamy mouthfeel, sweet hot finish. ItÂ’s good, close to the drink. Strong on barrel, moderate fruitiness. Fun to try, not sure IÂ’d have a lot of it, but good use of an old ale","the Containment Area, North Carolina, USA","OldGrowth"

3672,"2016-03-16",3.4,"Draft to taster at the brewpub. The beer is now known as ""Old Fashioned"" and this batch is 8.9% abv. Looks solid; a mostly transparent amberish caramel with beige head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells solid; semi-sweet with notes of caramel, oak, maraschino cherry, and orange zest alongside a touch of vanilla. Tastes like it smells, but a bit zestier, and with a bit more vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium full-bodied. A solid, interesting recreation of the cocktail.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

3672,"2014-11-18",3.8,"On tap a wicked weed brewing in Asheville north Carolina. Served in a snifter with a bit of orange rind as a garnish. This is a unique brew styled to mimic an old fashioned bourbon drink. I must day that it achieves that goal admirably. The beer has a definite bourbon barrel taste that mixed with the sweetness of the malt and the orange and cherry essences blends into a nice drink. If you donÂ’t like bourbon though, this is not the drink for you.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
3672,"2013-12-18",3.6,"11/26/13. On tap at the brewpub. An interesting brew for sure! Red brown pour with a small tan head. Nice aroma, the whiskey isnÂ’t too strong, with a good blend of maltiness, dark sugars, cherry, and orange. The flavor is nice as well, but loaded with cherry. So much cherry. Additionally some maltiness, sugars, orange, and whiskey. Interesting, tasty.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3672,"2013-11-19",4.0,"On tap at the brewpub. Burgundy clear pour. Rich aroma of orange juice, orange peel, and whiskey. Background notes of wood, lime, and maraschino cherries in the nose make this smell like a cocktail. Full massive flavor of whiskey, cherries, orange peel, and sangria. Warming whiskey finish. They really nailed what they were going for here. Massive and awesome!","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","italarican"
