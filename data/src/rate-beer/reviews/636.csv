636,"2015-10-17",4.0,"Bottle from Malt Attacks, reading 7% ABV instead of 8% but I assume this is still the same beer. Dense and creamy, regularly shaped, medium thick, deep tan head over a jet black beer. Pleasant aroma of black bitter chocolate, coffee with cream, haemoglobin iron, black tea, dry liquorice, cloves, toasted brown bread, dried juniper berries, some smoked meat, nettles, espresso beans, pipe tobacco ashes, tar. Creamy onset with sharply but finely stinging carbonation, some candied fruit sweetness but only very subtly so, surrounded by salty (salmiak), sourish (brambleberry) and umami (black olive) accents; full, creamy and oily body consisting of a thick layer of nutty and roasted grains with a certain kind of deep, dull grainy sourishness to it (I guess this is the oats), becoming more and more roasted bitter in the end with a coffeeish aromatic quality to it but only mildly so, eventually a bit charcoal-like as well; finishes in a lot of roasted bitterness along with peppery hops which blend in nicely, a faint hint of warming alcohol but nothing too obvious, and a remaining sensation of thick, bittersweet malts. I like stout in all its substyles and these guys are clearly good at it: though not too outspoken in terms of character and personality, this one is more than decent, powerful roasted bitterness truly shines here, mouthfeel and looks are exactly what youd expect from a 7% stout and there are no flaws whatsoever. It would be unfair to compare this with their imperial stout (the popular Plead the 5th), but in its particular stout substyle, this shows the same technical perfection.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Smell: Mm. Roasty and giving off the typical chocolate and coffee aromas, but also a caramel note that really makes me want to try it.

Taste/feel: Definitely get the creaminess from the oatmeal, thats the first thing I notice on every sip I take. The carbonation is very mild as well. The flavor is some deep roasted malt with a dark chocolate and black coffee finish. Not as robust as I was expecting, but very good. Aftertaste is a bit bitter with a burnt/ash flavor a bit there as well. Quite drinkable for the ABV, but still a bit light in the flavor.

Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent oatmeal stout! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

636,"2013-04-07",3.4,"Rated 3/20/13. 12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a black color; the pour itself looks quite dark and viscous. The head is a one finger light tan shade. It fades relatively quickly, leaving only minute lacing on the glass.

S: I definitely get a decent amount of oats on the nose, backed by a ton of roasted barley. Hints of chocolate, vanilla, and licorice are also present. Good, if muted.

T: Theres a mild smoked quality to the opening flavors that I find intriguing. Afterwards, it develops a dominant note of licorice with tones of coffee and vanilla on the finish. Moderately enjoyable, but the flavors could use more singular distinctness; they all seem to blend together.

M: This one is surprisingly heavy on the palate, backed by a good silky smoothness and tons of lingering flavor. If someone called this an imperial stout, I wouldnt think twice either way. Despite the score, I really love the texture here - but the problem is, it doesnt match up with the mellow flavors particularly well, so I cant give a great score here.

O: Nothing amazing, but its a solid offering. It kind of reminds me of a mediocre imperial stout, and thats actually a compliment in this case.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

636,"2012-04-23",3.5,"Originally reviewed: 1/6/10. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a very thick, deep black. This is the darkest standard stout I have seen in awhile. Creamy mocha head rests on top. Retains fairly well, but leaves no lace whatsoever. Big roasted scents come out of this right away, but then they dissipate, and its a struggle to get much in the nose on this. Some mild cocoa tones mixed in, but faint. 

Like all oatmeal stouts, the body on this is creamy and smooth. Carbonation level is hidden well as this is just a velvety beer. Alcohol presence gives a good bit of body on top. Good mellow flavors come out with oats, chocolate, and dark bitter coffee aftertaste. This is a good stout right here. Its a little on the heavy side, so I wouldnt have many at a time, but its a good treat when I do.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

Smoky roasted malt and rich dark chocolate are at the front of this beer which finishes with just a touch of light hop bitterness.  This one pushes the boundaries of the stout category and almost ends up as an Imperial Stout.

A: Pours a thick, dark chocolate color with a cinnamon-colored head. Quite a bit of carbonation; you can hear it fizzle as it settles in the glass.

S: Rich malt with scents of dark chocolate, followed up by increasing hints of oatmeal. Sweet liquor.

T: Very nice malt up front, coming in alongside semi-sweetened notes of chocolate. Slight hints of coffee--more in the minor acidic quality than in actual flavor, though its there. Quite good, but the chocolate flavor dominates a little too much.

M: Very smooth and medium-bodied. Mild carbonation. Goes down well with only the slightest hint of alcohol. 

D: Definitely drinkable, especially for the style. The lighter body makes for a beer you can definitely have more than one of at each sitting.

Flavor is more the same, but really drinks well. Im digging this. It has a ton of flavor, but doesnt have that thick feeling I was anticipating from the aroma. Lots of rich chocolate and brown sugar up front again, but more of a deep caramel flavor too. The roasts come out in the middle along with a touch of burnt coffee. They seem to balance the flavor much better than the aroma. Smooth oats, some licorice, and a hint of acidity that guides this into the finish where a light, earthy hop bitterness comes into play. The hops help dry this out along with the roasts before I get a hint of smoke in a lengthy aftertaste. Very smooth, medium body with a light carbonation that helps accentuate the flavors and makes this feel very rounded. Overall, a very nice oatmeal stout.

Big meaty aroma - later more soy sauce. Jet black, no head. Full palate, with pleasant soft carbonation. Not just full, but slick. Huge roasty body - very burnt but not astringent. Covers the alcohol well. However, by the end the slickness becomes too much - its actually slimy, and leaves the mouth feeling slimy, which is not the kind of finish I like.

636,"2009-07-11",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2009 12 ounce bottle that I decided to have on a summer day. I was pretty excited to have this stout. I am a huge fan of oatmeal stouts and really like Dark Horse. Pours an opaque black color with a half finger width tan head. This was the first stout by Dark Horse that I have seen with a head. The aroma consisted of sweet malt, bitter chocolate, and some coffee. The taste consists of oatmeal, sweet malt, and some bitter chocolate. As with most Dark Horse stouts, I thought this one was a bit light on the mouth feel but it did taste very good. Definitely my second favorite stout by Dark Horse... Plead the Fifth is definitely number one...","Streator, Illinois, USA","General66"

Flavor sweet with lots of dark fruits, really becomes the centerpiece in the mouth with the cocoa powder dancing around, as well as a coffee sort of bitterness, though not much coffee itself, just that sort of bitterness, if that makes sense. Very low carbonation, nearly syrupy, I think Id like a bit more to cut just a touch of the sweetness, but not so much that it really affects my rating...

How: Bottle 12oz.  Sent to me as a bonus by MatSciGuy.  Thanks a lot Levi, you really hit the spot with this one.
The look: Black body topped by a small tan head
In long:  Medium-low roastiness level, some roasted coffee beans, smooth velvety mouthfeel, that juicy black cereals thing that I only get from oatmeal stout, some berries (red and black), .  Interesting hops with a green pelett and tobacco leaves flavour.  This is everything a 5% session oatmeal stout should be except this one is 8%.  Dangerous.  Not that I mind being drunk, after all the only two ways I know to momentary forget about my problems is to get drunk or wear shoes two size too small.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Likewise, the nose is very faint and almost indistinguishable, but things get better from here. Mouthfeel is full and sweet, and the taste is a pleasant blend of chocolate, vanilla and toffee. 8% alcohol is very subtly pleasant in the taste as well, and this all blends to a finish that is long and just sweet enough.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"

Pours a dark black with a tiny brown head that disappates quickly. Smells of Chocolate, roasted coffee, and malt. Tastes of chocolate, lots of oats, and a metallic tint. Kind of weak-bodied, not leaving any residual taste. Overall its pretty smooth, but nothing special.","Highland Park, Illinois, USA","soccer290"
636,"2009-03-05",3.5,"12 oz. bottle. Stout, almost syrupy pour, very few scraps of brown foam. Big smell of roast barley and Kahlua, even for an 8% beer. Closer up, the Kahlua smell is even sweeter, almost cloying. Taste tells a slightly different story. A bit of cola texture; somewhat oily, then some coffee type bitterness. Does hold together nicely, missing only a more velvety smoothness from the usual oatmeal stouts. But that may not have been easy to do at this strength. But its very agreeable. Im not feeling the alcohol just yet, that probably waits until Ive finished it. I do like these one-off series from my favorite microbrewers; theyre lots of fun.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Aromas hit me out of the bottle: light grainy oatmeal cookie sweetness, light roasted malt, some creamy vanilla and cocoa. Very nice. Initial is lighter bodied than expected, but not necessarily light, a nice light roasted taste overtaken by sweeter oatmeal, vanilla, light cocoa, and very subtle coffee notes with smooth body that slips down the throat easily.

If this thing had any kind of decent head retention, this would have easily been a ""5"" for appearance.  Pleasant aroma of roasted malt and chocolate.

Aroma is burnt malts with espresso and licorice.  There is also a bit of sweetness in the smell as it warms with milk chocolate and vanilla.  The taste is also big of the roasted/burnt malt character.  The first taste is a sweet chocolate and vanilla blast which gives way to coffee and roasted malts.  The sweetness of the malts lingers through the finish with a slight coffee bitterness.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with a little carbonation which just coats the mouth with the massive malt flavors.

636,"2008-09-05",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2009 Bottle, hurricane glass, drunk at cellar temp.  Big roasty aroma.  Dark brown pour becomes black in the glass, almost no head, leaves the glass clean.  First sip is a roast monster, chocolate malts come out in force, hints of dark fruits.  Finishes fruity-bitter, like unripe peaches or green melon.  After the first couple sips, the mouth is quickly acclimated to the roasted barley, and except for the fruit notes at the end, it becomes a beer more felt than tasted.  Thick creamy mouthfeel here, slightly phenolic.  With the roast elements out of the way, several subtler flavors can be picked out: vanilla, anise, burnt toast are all here, but for the most part the front becomes somewhat cola-like, though not really sweet, and infinitely creamier.  A little grapey in the final afterglow.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"

636,"2008-07-12",3.9,"Bottle. Pours pitch black with an extremely dark dan head. The aroma has lots of a dark fruit tang mixed in with roasty, smokiness. Oatmeal as well as bitter cocoa and hints of coffee is also noticeable in the aroma. I was a little bit surprised at how light the brew felt to the tongue. It also has a little bit of oiliness to it that is best attributed to coffee oils. The initial flavour is mildly sweet of darker fruits combined with some chocolate. Shortly after, though, a light bitterness grabs the tongue as the cocoa and roastiness begin to burst. The tangy dark fruits continue to be quite noticeable. It isnt until the dark fruit flavours start to diminish when the oatmeal begins to surface. Towards the finish, the dark fruit merely becomes a shadow as oatmeal becomes dominant. Cocoa, light coffee, and roasty flavours merely complement the oatmeal. There is a slightly noticeable bitterness in the finish as well. This is very tasty and theres a lot going on in the flavour.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

636,"2008-02-25",3.8,"300th United States Rating: Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in an English pint glass.  This stout poured a near opaque black with a thin, creamy, dark tan head that slightly lasted.  Almost no lace to speak of.  The aroma of the beer was made up of chocolate-covered malted milk balls, medium roast coffee, and oats.  The flavor consisted of rich dark chocolate, a mildly bitter coffee note, and some tongue warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and silky smooth with light carbonation.  A really nice stout.  The only drawback, being that the alcohol was a bit too noticable and kind of seemed out of place.  Take the ABV down to 6.5% and this would probably be a 4+ rating.  Other than that, really well done.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"
636,"2008-02-25",3.9,"2/25/2007:  Dark Horse One Oatmeal Stout Ale is an extremely dark brown and is quite opaque.  There is no head or crown and a mild level of fine carbonation.  The aroma is filled with dark roasted malt, sweet rich caramelized malts, smooth dark chocolate, vanilla, and some char.  The flavor is very, very roasted and charred (but not burnt) with some hints of semi-sweet and dark chocolate.  This beer is surprisingly smooth on the palate (probably due to the oatmeal) and has a medium to medium-full body and a slightly creamy texture.  This beer isnt really sweet, but isnt anywhere close to bitter.  Overall all I would say that this is a nicely balanced, yet robust Oatmeal Stout.  Very good.

The flavor is dark and roasty, with chocolate malts again showing strong.  The booze component is too strong, however, tipping the scale towards unbalanced, hot, and messy.  The medium body is mildly astringent for the style, finishing warm and overly alcoholic.  I had such high hopes for this brew after trying the Tres and Fore, but the One falls well short of the lofty standard that Dark Horse has set.  Better than average, but quite a bit overrated.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Pours a rich dark black color with the darkest brown head Ive seen on any oatmeal stout.  Smell is lightly smoky, stale wet cardboard and roasty malt.  Rather unimpressive nose actually. Taste is rather smoky for a sweet stout or oatmeal with decent roasty character.  Mouthfeel is just average with light carbonation.  Overall, disappointing like the other 2 beers Ive had from Dark Horse.  I expected more, and this seems to have a smoky presence that doesnt fit the style and is a bit offputting despite the fact that I enjoy smoked beers.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

636,"2008-01-20",3.8,"Pours oily and black with a brandy glow around the rim; head is gone within seconds.  Aroma first suggests licorice, peanut butter and fudge before turning fruity and spicy; cinnamon, red apple skins, earthy caramel, bananas.  Lightly pungent and buttery like sour milk and hazelnuts, riding out on burnt dark roast.  The flavor is really loose and velvety with oat texture, bringing a lot of cold raspberry, apple and blueberry fruitiness that seem to burst from a type of light roasted coffee base; very tangy, bright, and punchy.  Spritzy and medium bodied palate seems a bit sharp at first, but settles itself as the textures slide together toward the finish; lots of belgian chocolate, light rum, and dry tobacco smoke at that point.  Drying out a bit, but remaining rich enough to stave off astringency.  Another solid example from this very professional brewery.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Quite creamy and quick with a slick medium body that oothes all sorts of silky, soft, and smooth chocolateyness. Mind you, theres not a whole lot of chocolate in the taste, but the feel speaks well of a firm chocolate milk with a nice little roasty bite to its finish that lasts well and keeps a tender balance of dryness floating at the bit.

Rich roasted malty nose of charred chocolate and dark coffee with a dash of oatmeal sweetness. Further whiffs reveal scents of roasted barley and a subtle nuttiness.

The body has a nice well rounded and creamy feel in the mouth. For an Oatmeal Stout, this has a full roasted malt taste with a pleasantly mild charred bitterness. Dark coffee sweeten by sugar, charcoal melded with bittersweet dark chocolate. The oatmeal brings out a vanilla-like sweetness in the middle.

Dark Horse

Dark Horses Oatmeal Stout gurgles from the bottle to the glass.Yes, the body is thick and solid black. Not one glimmer of light escapes. A one plus finger brown head formed on the pour and fell rather quickly to a skimming with tight edges. As good as the body looks if the head stuck around longer it would be a knockout. 

Smell is good but a little faint. Roasted, slightly charred, barley is the base and main ingredient in the mix. Theres creaminess coming through and oddly enough Im picking up some butterscotch every now and then. Theres hints of dark coffee grounds as well.

Aroma is in step with the flavor. Big roastiness up front fades mid palate but is always there and in charge. Coffee grounds and lactic creaminess mid-palate leads through to the finish. Theres a nice solid pine hop presence on the swallow. Good stout.

The body of this beer is exceptional. Tremendously smooth with a heavy though velvety body. Carbonation is on the low end of the spectrum allowing this beer to glide along the palate.

This stout goes down very easily and its very easy to put away a few in a sitting.

Last year I got my hands on Tres stout (blueberry). This is my first sampling of the oatmeal and it is damn fine. From my expierences Dark Horse makes some tasty stouts and I hope they keep them coming.

As I go back and take another sniff, I notice a charcoal and bourbon presence there.  My first thoughts are that it has a little thinner mouthfeel than I expected and the flavor comes off as much more burnt and charcoaly than anticipated, too.

636,"2007-08-17",3.4,"Thanks to someone (Immy perhaps?) for sending me this bottle. Its a nice stout for sure. It had a few things that could either be better or more pronounced, but the sum of the beer was clearly above average. The beer pours out of the bottle in a thick streak of ooey black goodness. It hits the glass and immediate creates a light chocolately brown head with tiny bubbles being the base for some big foamy bubbles. The head disappates rather quickly unfortunately and whats left is a black coffee looking brew with no semblance of a head. My sniffer picks up anise immediately. Sweet, roasted, wet malts are next. Some obvious coffee notes too. But underlying all of it is this odd irony, metallic character that is really unpleasant. It kinda reminds me of drinking a stout from a can character. Mouthfeel is smooth with a hotness brought on by the alcohol content, but as it warms up that disappears a bit. Flavor isnt horrible. Perhaps a step-up from average. Strong with coffee with a shot of alcohol clearly present. Some vinous notes started creeping in as it really got to room temp. Subtle chocolate notes that I wish were more prevelent were also popping up. Id like to have my sweet stouts a bit sweeter than this as this was a bit dry I thought. Overall not bad. Not sure if I could (or would) drink more than a pint of this. It could have been more smooth, less alcoholic, a bit sweeter with more complexity.

Full nectar w/ soft and velvety residual effers creates a rather sensuous brew. The brew glides in silky then turns to velvet on the way down. The mildly sweet flavor profile starts out w/ heavily roasted viscous malts. Then the defined asprin bittering component kicks in to balance.

636,"2007-07-10",3.6,"12 oz bottle
I have been sitting on this bottle for a while and decided it was finally time to crank it open.  In an attempt to thin the herd I am working through the beers which either will not age gracefully or will not improve in the cellar.  This one was probably five months old when I opened it at the end of June.  The local store has more left though Im not sure I will pick it up - this did not strike me as a particularly good beer to sit on for more than a few months.
Aroma / Appearance - The black body is opaque without being too dark as a moderate amount of light can still sneak through.  A half finger tan colored head sits on top like mocha frosting.  Cinnamon, oatmeal, bittersweet chocolate and vanilla form the principal scents which are complimented by smoke and coffee.  This has all the hallmarks of a sweet stout based on the nose.
Flavor / Palate - Peat blended with dark chocolate, smoke and coffee beans which have been roasted almost to the point of being burned form the first impression.  Next comes cocoa, more smoke and carbonation.  A lingering bitterness sits underneath everything to provide a point of reference.  While it is not chewy the mouthfeel is still thick enough to be satisfying.  The richness is offset by a subtle sweetness.  Im glad to have tried this one and wish I would have had the foresight to pick up the Fore as well.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Dry and complex - hides the alcohol well, but is ear-warming.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
636,"2007-05-15",4.0,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Purchased at Rileys Wines of the World in Madison, WI.  Pours a very dark black, chalky obsidian color with a thick layer of foamy bubbled tan head.  Well sustaining head that collapses onto itself to form a milky cream topping.  Lovely aroma thats brimming with coffee, dark chocolate, a touch of anise, and a hint of freshly chopped mint leaves.  Great balance of the roasty character with the minty hops, and as a bonus, the malt character is roasty and intriguing in other dark dimensions.  I love the balance between the hops, chocolate, and coffee; its what I would expect an andes mint melted in sumatran roast coffee would smell like.  Light bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel.  The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than Id like, and the flavors start out a bit slow, but they really take off on the back end.  The start of the palate brings out some weaker flavors of simple toast, but then transitions to an intense, long lasting flavor parade that brings out all of the great aroma traits.  The roastiness of the malt transitions into some smooth chocolate roast coffee, turns a bit spicy with the anise and licorice tones, and then finishes with some pleasant mint, all of the flavors lasting while the next phase builds on top of the former.  Great beer, but would be even better if it had a bit more body to create a silkier mouthfeel and get some of those flavors dancing in the carbonation to settle down on the tongue more quickly.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
636,"2007-05-13",3.8,"Pours a dark dark dark brown with no head.  This only makes it look darker, which in the world of stouts, makes me think a beer to be more attractive.  Maybe the bottle is old?  Doesnt smell old.  Mocha, coffee, chocolate, and everything in between.  Really reminds me of a slightly fainter Founders Breakfast Stout.  Creamy, with a little fig, and only a hint of roast and floral hops.  Dense and viscous in the mouth with surprising levels of carbonation given the complete lack of head.  Again, tastes a lot like Founders Breakfast Stout, though much cleaner in terms of diacetyl, though theres still some in there,but rightfully so.  Big sweet mocha maltiness.  Creamy, with a little hint of alcohol.  Chocolate, coffee, and some dates give way to a bit of balancing acidity.  Alcohol, roast, and a bit of astringency linger.  The aftertaste is mostly charcoally roast.  A rather nice beer indeed.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Aroma was of subdued dark chocolate. There was slight sweetness up front which was tempered by a roasty malt bitterness that lingered. The dominant flavors were coffee and roasted malt.

Starts off with an oily sweetness that comes in a roastiness and finishes with a beautiful strong bitterness to offset it all.  Leaves a lasting lightly roasted coffee bitter aftertaste.

636,"2005-08-08",2.7,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2007 Bottle from Eyedrinkale shared on 8/5/05.  Pours a dark blackish-brown with an initially large tan-coffee colored head that quickly dissipates to just a smattering of bubbles on top and at the edges.  Really heavily sedimented beer with plenty left in the bottle.  Aroma smells of dry roast, black coffee, vinousness and some sweet toffee, but not much of it.  Dark, bitter cocoa beans and a earthy, ashy sort of aspect too.  Flavor didnt work out on this bottle, not sure why, I know it was cellared properly.  But regardless, it was thin, wet and at the same time ashy and astringent.  Like an old pot of black coffee.  Grapey, muddy, loose, watery, astringent, charred.  Not many nice things to say about this one.  Seemed like an older bottle, no green hops flavor.  Maybe this batch just didnt age well.  Oh well, no big deal, Ill try a fresh one soon, and redo it.Rerate.Still dont know how old the bottle, but the head retention is still poor.Muted aroma of cherries, chocolate and vanilla.  Nothing particular.  But the flavor is full of roasted malts and lovely chocolatey notes.  A slight nutty/bready edge but its overcome by some phenolic and char character.  Hmm, actually, thats not such a good thing.  Texture is perfect as always from DH, but the grain bill just seems weird.  Ill up it a few points, I guess, its still pretty drinkable, just too many phenols and not enough residual sugar.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Mild fruity hop presence meshes with bittersweet chocolate, honey, candied black currants, and tar undertones. Full and creamy mouthfeel. Silky, semi-oily. Starts with full-blown espresso richness infused with black licorice. Assertive char flavors grit up the palate and contribute to the roasted barley dryness. Vanilla accentuates the firm toasted wood flavors. Very fulfilling, throughout, with a rich interplay between the black patent astringency and roasted barley. Just enough espresso to curtail the chalkiness. Finishes everlastingly chewy and burnt with a steadily heightening espresso richness that reaches its apex in the finish amid bittersweet chocolate assertions and dark fruit nuances. Delicious. Note: This is a very fragile brew and seems to go sour rather quickly.

636,"2003-10-24",3.7,"Deep, oily brown-black colour with a tiny coffee & cream head. Sweet, nutty roastiness in the nose. Full mouthfeel, very creamy. Roasted malt flavour with the expected hints of chocolate, coffee and caramel, and a mild hop finish. Not a world-beater, but a very solid stout.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
636,"2003-06-27",3.6,"(Also known as ""One"")Strong roasted aroma emanates from another dark, motor-oil like body.  Flavor is smooth, somewhat dry, dominated by roasted malts and with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Not as interesting as the Cream Stout, but still solid.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
636,"2003-01-17",3.5,"Not a fan of stouts. This one had a molasses look to it when it came out of the bottle.  Complex smells to it, a sweet roasted smell.  First taste tasted of strong coffee.  Finished this one with a slow deliberate pace tring to pace the taste.  After tasting this one, would recommend it to someone looking for a good stout.  (thanks psychprof for giving me the opportunity to rate this one.)","Sharon, Wisconsin, USA","awaller05"
636,"2002-12-30",3.8,"On my bottle it says Oatmeal Stout Ale and One so there seems to be some confusion going on as to which stout is 1 or 2, but thats fine. This is typical Dark Horse for me by now; quite solid roastiness, almost over the edge, just a tiny bit of sweetness conveyed by the flaked oats, pretty full in the mouth, clever hop close. Just another good stout by them. Not a world-killer, but tasty.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
636,"2002-11-14",2.5,"Im not a fan - blistering roasts and bitters and roughness in the mouth when I like my stouts full and chewy and sweeter.  Obviously of good quality ingredients, just not to my taste.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","brownalegirl"
636,"2002-11-14",3.3,"Also known as ""Too"" in the trio of Dark Horse stouts.  This one and the Cream variety look remarkably similar - deep brown with a quick scattering tan head.  This one has less of a nose and a more unbalanced flavour and texture.  Its more unevenly carbonated and its harder to find the either the dark malt goodnesss or lighter oaty tones under the edges. In fact, its best to mix the two stouts.  Im serious!  I had the two pints poured simultaneously and when each got down to a third of a glass or so I whimsically mixed them.  The result deepened the full round sweet flavours and allowed them to better battle the bitters.  The mixture reminded me of some of the better Imperials for complexity.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
