2983,"2012-01-13",1.9,"1L glass bottle pours a golden color with a fast dissipating white head.  All I will say about this one is that it is one of the worst beers I have ever tried.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
2983,"2010-08-02",2.4,"Obligatory malt likra purchase for the long weekend at the lake. Actually looks quite decent--  deep golden with a dense, creamy, lasting white head that captures the gently falling ashes from the stirred-up fire pit, like grey cinnamon dusting a beer latte. Aroma is corn syrup and bananas, no alcohol that I can smell (but Im fighting campfire smoke, and Im basically shitcanned at this point anyway). Smooth, sweetly malty, warming. Would I buy this again? Fuck no. Was it a decent malt liquor? Sure. But thats like saying ""Thats the best gas station burrito Ive ever had"".","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
2983,"2007-07-12",2.3,"Golden and clear with minimal head.  Corny grassy aroma.  Lots of malt, a touch of grain and a little alcohol.  Decent for a malt liquor.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","BeerPrince"
2983,"2007-07-03",2.3,"Corn, banana, alcohol and grain in the nose.  Clear golden body is topped by a decent white head that lasts and laces well.  Very sweet flavour shows off plenty of corn, some wacky fruity esters and some alcohol.  Grainy in the aftertaste.  Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Sure its well made.  Still dont really care for it though.  Bottle sampled with BeerPrince, CapFlu and Oakes.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
2983,"2007-07-01",3.4,"Slow carbo, gold colour, thin head.  Big alcohol on the nose, with some slight crystal malt chewiness and plenty of creamed corn.  Full body.  Noticeable hop crispness.  More chewy maltiness.  Everything in balance, and it still retains that kick-you-in-the-nuts character a malt liquor needs to have.  A rating to style would be in the high 4s.  As it is, this is a remarkably high quality forty.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2983,"2007-06-16",3.0,"Dark gold. Starts with a good head and maintains a nice white film. Aroma starts out like high alcohol fuel and then indeed a banana scent comes out. As it sits more of a dirty fuel scent is common with hints of the banana. Relatively full bodied and at least when cool drinkable. Tastes like high alcohol, grain and banana traces. Alcohol burns the ears. Even as it warms it is drinkable. Not a great beer but a great malt liquor, easily my highest rated.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
2983,"2007-03-01",4.4,"Insanely good malt liquor, im a black bull man but i have to admit that this 40 blows black bull out of the water, you cannot even taste the 9% and its very cheap even compared to other malt liquors, pound for pound this is about as good as beer can get, im proud to say that this is brewed in my home town","CANADA","jason69"
2983,"2007-02-23",3.2,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2007 1.18Liter bottle = 40OZ.  Looks exactly as illustrated in the picture. First of all this is lowest priced alcohol of any kind Ive seen in Alberta.

Chilled in -20C/0F weather, opened bottle, aroma isnt offensive. Took a sip, this is suprisingly drinkable. I cant believe this has 9% alcohol init. Zero head, fruity taste(not honey), moderate carbonation, almost no aftertaste. 

This is cheapest beer in the market at $3.20 per bottle of 40oz. I need to drink few more to find any adverse effect.","Alberta, CANADA","cheapactuary"
2983,"2005-02-25",3.1,"Thanks to my future sister-in-law for the one. 1.18 liter bottle. Pretty good. Smooth malt flavor that I wasnt expecting. Wasnt harsh.  Alcohol was good also at 9%.","Voorhees, New Jersey, USA","dberger624"
2983,"2004-12-13",3.2,"Golden beer with a small white head. Pleasant bananas in aroma, almost like a wheat beer, or a hefe. Light fruity taste with pleasant malt. Nice bodied. Actually a very decent malt liquor, aka, Saskahootch. Thanks to the capflu. (Sept. 2004)","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
2983,"2004-09-27",3.2,"(1 litre glass bottle) The bottled-behemoth from Saskatchewan! Enjoyed with Lubiere (Sept 04). Malt liquor? Id say EXTRA STRONG HEFE!!! Strong though lightly sweetened banana nose. Pours an amber body which is lightly carbonated and with a thin, white head. Smooth banana-y flavour with little detection of alcohol. Kinda amazing for a Malt Liquor of 9%, no? I actually liked this one more than all the other Great Western brews. Its very good!","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
