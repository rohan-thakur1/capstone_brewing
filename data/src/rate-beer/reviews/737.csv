737,"2017-02-12",3.2,"750 mL bottle shared by ebone1988. The pour is a darker brown/light black with a thicker light khaki head and a lot of soapy lace as it falls down to a thick collar and film. The aroma is definitely heavy on spicy rye. There is a bit of chocolate malt and a light roastiness. Its got a little bit of a Porter thing going on that Im definitely not a fan of. The flavor is much of the same. There is a spicy rye and a chocolate malt that drinks like a porter for sure. There is a viscosity and a bitterness about it that isnt terrible. The mouth feel is robust and brightly carbonated with a bitter roast and spicy rye aftertaste. This isnt that good at all. Ugh.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

737,"2016-12-01",3.9,"75cl, 2016 vintage - Nov2016, B&Co. - An odd yet workable recipe yielding a tasty mix of autumnal Belgian dubbel (ripe orchard fruit, compote), a musty saison leafiness and some rye spice with hefty body supporting it. Earthy, ""organic"" and subtle use of earthy EU-pedigree hops. Flourishes of iron, liquorice, quince peel, caramel to keep it interesting. Remarkably demure and mature for a US saison.

Glass: Joseph James pint glass
From: Naked City Pizza in Paradise (Las Vegas,), Nev.
Price: $7
Purchased: March 25, 2016
Consumed: March 25, 2016
Misc.: Got the last bit of a keg; NOTE: Lost all my notes for this one, going with what I remember and wrote on Untappd

Heard good things about this place, but nothing really intrigued me on the tap list when I got there. Pizza was really good. Originally looked at the draft list, but the bartender told me that the drafts were all kicked. Then went with an Evil Twin Saison, which apparently was out as well. The lady told me that there might be a little bit left of this beer (probably because I ordered a Saison the first time) and she was right. I might have received one of the last two or three cups. NOTE: Read #6 Saison on the board, but this appears to have been a #6 Rye Beer according to Beer Advocate.

Poured an amber, clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of off-white head when I got it. Good amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. Good amount of retention on the way down. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled red apple, plum, dark fruits, light burnt toffee and earthy grass. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste was just as good, mainly getting red apple, plum, purple grape and light toffee. Some wintry notes - faint molasses and some rye spiciness - coming in as well. (Taste - 4.00)

Medium body. Oily texture. Soft carbonation. Long finish. (Feel - 4.00)

Really wish I would not have deleted my notes, as I enjoyed this one. Would have it again for sure. (Overall - 4.00)

737,"2014-01-20",3.8,"April 28th, 2012 - Uprights Brewing Six is a beer that I purchased on a lark, and those tend to be very risky business indeed. Whole Foods has a tendency to groom their beer shelves in a way where a strategic part or a a prominent plateau can pull the shoppers eye to a privileged beer. How Whole Foods impairs my judgment, I cannot say. I suspect the delicious pizza-by-the-slice is drugged. Whatever the business method chosen, I grabbed a bottle of Upright Brewings Six knowing nothing about the brewery, its location, or even what the Six stood for. Supposedly its the sixth in a series of venerable beers, but for all I know, it could be the number of bottles they executed to sell. That certainly cant be true, however, because this is an excellent beer and a tasty companion to a weekend evening. It pours cloudy and chalky, producing a blooming aroma that is intense with rye, rye bread, and a bitter bite that keeps my nose at a safe distance. This doesnt mean Im retreating from the beer, but Im admiring it from afar, like that creepy guy on the back of the bus who seems to be taking in his environment with a little too much intensity. A cornucopia of grains defines the flavor. This is an unwelcome place for sugars. The Six instead focuses on blending malts and the rolled rye to deliver a liquid meal: molasses and bread, pumpernickel too, and a yeasty touch that reminds me of the lighter grains of flavor that always seem to appear in saisons. And harkening back to joyous rides in carts around pumpkin patches or circuses, there is the intense grassiness of golden, bundled hay, all in a delicious drinkable form.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

737,"2013-10-27",4.0,"Uhhhhhh never rated this? The only beer Ive been drinking casually the last couple of weeks. Dark burnt orange haze under light with a big ass bubbly tan noggin. I think this beer interests me more than I enjoy it if that makes sense. Smells lightly woody, tropical and cherry concentrate juice, liquid squeezy candy death with a faint sour hint. The taste reminds me of the time that I borrowed a pair of really baggy jeans which I cut the pockets open on, tucked the cuffs into my converse high tops and then proceeded to fill my pants with dozens of items stolen from my local Macs store which we pilfered regularly. Pretty sure that time included bottles of Gatorade, mags, mint Aero bars and other random things. This was many years after that Robotron game was removed. Actually it has nothing to do with the taste - just a random memory of random theft. The aroma is constant and lively throughout. Unique flavour is what keeps me coming back to this. Zip and an interesting bitterness. Mellow but harsh yet well placed. A blink of grass, very dry feeling, lengthy tartness, chocolate, faint roast, whatever tropical things are in here, dirty cherry.

Pours dark red with a ruby glint around the edges & persistent head, even with a gentle hand. Smell is wild: rye, spices, passing hops, even a shot of alcohol. Faint fruit, too. Lovely. 

Upright Six is a beer you could assign random descriptors & probably be right. The spices & the yeast vie for attention when the brew hits the tongue; an almost saisonesque undercurrent merges with an understated rye spiciness. Peppery. Fruit is almost a tart blackberry or underripe blueberry; odd. Slight must right at the end. Grainy, too. Aggressively carbonated. Weirdly appealing & disappears like theres a hole in the side of the glass.

Starts with the same notes you find in the aroma, then shows a burst of pine-resin hops, then fades into toasted grains. It has a thick mouthfeel, but it finishes bone dry and fairly bitter.

737,"2011-06-25",4.1,"A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four finger thick, glass filling, lightly browned, dark tan colored head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a dark brown color that shows a viscous texture to it by the carbonation bubbles that struggle to swim through it.  The aroma smells a little tart and somewhat fruity that is backed by a grainy / malty character.  The beer has a brown cracker aromatic note to it as well as a husk-like, thrushed grain, or even straw like character to it towards the finish.  There is a spiciness here that seems mostly contributed by the yeast character (peppery with a touch of ginger even), but the rye and dark grain character also subtly influences this as does a touch  of spicy hop character.  The fruitiness, especially as it warms, reminds me of a tart / floral plum and even with a touch of Macintosh apple like aromatics.  The grain character and yeast definitely has a musty character and a brown toasted grain starts to come out as the beer warms up.

The viscous quality of this beer has held in the carbonation quite well and it effervesces quite a bit as it rolls across the tongue.  There is a definite tartness to this beer, though it isnt really big (i.e. this is not a sour beer by any means), and it accentuates the fruitiness that is in the flavor; the fruit character reminds me of plums (though not as complex as in the aroma) and perhaps a touch of tart raisin.  As the beer warms up a bit more a a complex grain character starts to come out in the finish; it is a bit spicy, sort of reminds me of toasted hay, perhaps a hint of bitter cocoa, and it definitely reminds me of spicy, toasty, whole grain character (and even rye specifically).  Despite have a fair amount of viscousness to it, this beer is still quite quaffable and light.  There is an herbal character from the hops that, towards the finish, melts into the tartness somehow; it has a touch of pine like character to it, perhaps a hint of rosemary and a light, but firm bitterness as well.  Flavors of tamarind are also found here.

This is a very nice beer; I really enjoy this interpretive Saison from upright, the rye and the darker malt character really takes this in a great direction.  It may not be a unique direction, but it is certainly well executed and quite tasty in the glass.  Even though I have liked this from the beginning, it is still growing on me more as it warms up and I work my way through this beer.  This is definitely my favorite upright beer of the few I have tried so far.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

737,"2011-03-15",3.4,"750 mL bottle. Poured into Duvel tulip. 

APPEARANCE:

Pours deep amber copper with a ruby hue. Hazy. 

Huge creamy head is 3+ fingers, light beige, and has lengthy retention. Head settles in a rocky fashion and leaves some patches of lacing. 

Noticeably rapid carbonation trail rising from center of bottom of glass. 

AROMA: Tart red fruit (pomegranate, raspberry, and cherry). Sour. Saison yeast. Wet dead leaves (ie, rainy Fall day). Tree-like earthiness; similar to a woody aroma. Faint peppery spice. Some light chalkiness. Extremely faint vanilla bean/white chocolate. The chocolate and caramel aromas described on bottle do come out as it warms up a bit, though only subtly - even then, they are largely masked by the overall tartness. 

TASTE: Tart with some tart bitterness. Tangy. Quite puckering. Subtle stone-like earthiness. Tart red fruit, primarily pomegranate; as well as some subtle cherry. Taste is like eating pomegranate and then once the fruit is eaten off the seed, chewing the seed to get a lengthy bitter finish. 

Some faint vanilla as well as even more subtle wood on back of palate. 

Faint metallic taste on finish. 

Finish is more tart bitterness. 

Have to work quite hard to discern chocolate and caramel notes on palate  they appear on back of palate when it warms up a bit; even then, are largely masked by overall tartness and bitterness. 

MOUTH FEEL: Nice carbonation. Medium bodied. Quite smooth for such a puckering beer. Fairly dry.

OVERALL: Primarily tart and bitter. Much more tart than expected. Ok, though expected more from this beer; in particular, expected more saison-like qualities. Unable to pick out much of the rye characteristics in the taste behind all the tartness. Rustic. Would pair well with hard cheeses, though unlikely that would want to pair this with charcuterie or cooked red meat.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

737,"2011-02-17",2.7,"My Bottom Line:
Blackberry fruitiness evolves into tartness, while pickle-like vinegar notes and bubbly, detached carbonation point to a building infection...

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam tops the mahogany-hued brown.
-The commercial description says ""chocolate and caramel""... There was nothing remotely close to these flavors, so, with the vinegary flavors, I presume something went awry with this bottle and/or batch.
-The finish is slightly wild and quite dry.
-Bready notes emerge from the malt signature, alongside roasted flakes.
-Candied cherries appear here and there.

Aromas of dark roasted malt and darkish fruit thru the foam. Flavor is tart chocolate cherry with some wood astringency. And I think theres more in there, but its all tangled.

737,"2010-09-14",3.2,"In short: A rough, grainy, toasted and dusty semi-rustic dark Saison
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed relatively fresh, six months after bottling.  
The look: Cloudy burgundy body topped by a an abnormally large beige head.  Not a gusher, but close
In long: Nose of dusty attic, salad croutons, dry rye bread.  Taste of melba toasts, seeds, rustic yeast, grainy malts, dust, milk chocolate, earth, coal.  Overall the beer came through as rather rough.  There was a rustic Saison yeast twist but this is a bad interpretation of the style.  As a dirty yeasty ale it is ok, as a Saison it fails.  Saisons should be session beers.  The more of those dark Saisons I try, the more I think they make as much sense as a Learn to Read in 21 days book.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

737,"2010-07-25",3.8,"750ml bottle.  Pouring a mostly clear, dark cherrywood color, the body lofts up a billowing head of spongy, khaki colored froth.  The steadfast foam slowly gives way to solid walls of lacing that break apart into organic, clumpy splotches and flares.  Aromas are dry and spicy, showing notes of cola, dehydrated figs, and baked rye bread in the malt base, accentuated with notes of caraway seed, chicory, oily orange peel, and some minty saison yeast.  A faint hint of airy, whipped cream softens all the sharp edges. Flavors are similarly structured, again quite dry, with just a bit of cola and roasted caramel sweetness there to break up the reign of spicy rye, aged citrus hops, and peppery, minty Belgian yeast.  Figgy fruit sugars intensify on the finish, leaving behind a sweet aftertaste. The palate, while only moderate in substance, is perfectly balanced in terms of carbonation, and is delectably dry until after the swallow.  Its alltogether quite drinkable and pleasing, even on a 96 degree day on Captiva Island, which is where I find myself today.

My first disappointment from Upright. Red-brown pour, long-lived off-white head. Nice gently sour aroma with rye forward. I agree with the ""whiskey notes"" in the commercial description, with the amendment that it is cheap whiskey. The flavor disappoints, though; theres an overly strong rye-heavy sourness to the beer, still plenty of sugars that dont help matters. Some medicinal, even metallic bitterness. This comes off a bit like something that Jolly Pumpkin would brew, but without the JP house character that lets them get away with it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
