3639,"2016-02-20",2.0,"Poured into an SA Perfect Pint showing lightly filtered cloudy caramel brown with sparse white foam on the top. 

The nose shows notes of soy sauce and very bready malts. 

The palate is moderately carbonated and full bodied with barely any flavor. Big bready yeastiness at the finish. Is this off?!","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
3639,"2016-02-14",3.4,"This is not a bitter, but more a low abv Pale ale. Reminds me of a lot of the flavor profile for many pale ales in Japan around 6 or 7 years ago. Things have progressed a lot since then, so yeah, decent drop but not that spec.","JAPAN","jonno"
3639,"2016-02-09",3.3,"Caramel malt, overripe orange, stale cascade maybe, dough, notes of cocoa, citrus peel, quite bitter with a green herbal feel, gentle fruitiness, finish is quite long and bitter. Hmm, not so bad for the style maybe but well... not so special :","","biirusaikou"
3639,"2016-02-01",3.5,"Pours nice amber, slight haze, thin head. Aroma is grassy and hoppy. Bit of hop skunkiness there as well. Taste is also hoppy and bitter, resins make it a bit unbalanced and earthy. Not very fruity hops but still doing some nice work. Dry and drinks easy, thin body is well hidden and drinks better than its low abv would suggest. Good hoppy session pale ale.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
3639,"2016-01-29",4.5,"Fruity aroma, full body, muted tea flavors up front, and full-blown citrus at the back. Pleasant aftertaste. Overall, very trademark Shiga Kogen.","Tokyo, JAPAN","yenbeer"
3639,"2016-01-26",3.6,"Bottle from Tanakaya. Peach and melon with some fresh baked bread and orange zest. Light body with average carbonation. Nice pithy bitterness on the palate with some light pepper. Dry and scratchy finish. Nice enough.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
3639,"2015-10-13",3.3,"Tap at Yellow Ape. 
L: a murky pond water brown, tiny head. 
S: I get so little on the nose. Malty and earthy but subtle. 
T: its easy drinking, quite floral in the hops. 
F: it has a light smooth bitterness, quite dry. 
O: this was the start of the keg, and to be honest it didnt look like theyd filtered it through the tap properly. Tasted ok though.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"
3639,"2015-05-24",3.6,"Aroma: Floral, dried orange, dry pine note.
Palate: Light bodied yet not thin.
Flavor: Dried orange, pine, herbal hop on the mid-palate. Finishes slightly bitter, though the dryness dominates.
Comment: Moderately bitter. Sessionable for the hophead.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"
3639,"2015-04-15",3.8,"Draught at Bungalow. Pours a light copper with good lacing. Malty aroma with a strong hops behind it. Nice, fresh bitter flavour, some caramel behind it.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
3639,"2015-02-08",3.4,"light Amber brown color. Light malty nose with some cereal Malts. The mouth is really focused on the malt backbone but decent bitterness. I wouldnt call it a traditional english bitter. Nice","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
3639,"2014-12-24",3.8,"Tap at Craftheads. Why do I always like foreign attempts at bitters better than British bitters? Malty, light spiciness, aroma is quite British, taste similar, but got that little bit of carbonation. Caramel hints. I like it.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
3639,"2014-12-20",3.8,"Small glass on draft at Craft Beer Market Jimbocho. Clear golden orange with off-white head. Aromas of citrus, floral, light herb. Tastes of floral, citrus, bitter notes. Medium body with a dry finish.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
3639,"2014-12-19",3.5,"Tap at Bungalow. Amber-orange color, lace. Malty, earthy nose, caramel, English pa malts, nicely bitter with grassy, earthy hops. Decent.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
3639,"2014-12-19",3.8,"4.2% Bitter On tap at Bungalow but launched at Craft Heads 10 year anniversary event according to their blog. I was assured isnt the same as their Not So Mild Ale. A clear shiny copper color with a thin foamy off-white head. Great lacing streaking down the glass as I continue drinking! The nose is juicy citrus & piney hops. A decent body med-thin but it gets the job done. Easy drinking hop forward low-ABV beer Id classify as an APA. The taste is earthy prickly pine, sweet citrus and a touch of biscuity malts. Really well done & while Not So Special it is pretty damn good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
