901,"2017-01-25",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2017 Light pear aroma, the taste is pear and a hint of cantaloupe with a nice heat in the finish. Also tried it warmed up when it gets a fried apple taste, but its much more enjoyabe chilled. I really like the bottle which looks very much like a well designed oil can.","","koviiubii"

901,"2007-03-08",3.7,"My final style!!!!!!!     Pour is almost completely clear with hints of faint ""off clear"", yellow...smell is smell is highly alcoholic...some delicate flower notes and pepper....intensely perfumey...literally perfumey, not the faint notes of perfume that some sakes and beers have...most perplexing the flavor...not nearly as alcoholic as I would have thought or the nose led me to believe...sweet and rich...definately lots of sweet almond (marzipan) happening...tastes sweet and doughy like a nigori, but after some research I sort of understand why....a bizarre finish...sweet and dry all at the same time...maybe dry finish with a sweet aftertaste is the proper terminology...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
