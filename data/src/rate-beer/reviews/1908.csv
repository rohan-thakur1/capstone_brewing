1908,"2017-01-01",3.5,"From bottle in English pint glass. Pours clear amber with frothy head and earthy citrus aroma that is a nice blend of hops and malt. The same can be said of the taste with the palate a bit more robust than other pale ales. A solid old world ale with a new world twist.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","ANZUShophunter"
1908,"2016-12-29",3.9,"Bottle - digestive biscuit malt dominant as is the English mould - just enough fruity hops to tone down the malt - mild bitterness - too cloying to be refreshing but easy drinking accompaniment with pizza. Like it, dont love it.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Hop_Hedonist"

Mango, passion fruit and peach on the nose with some light melon notes as well. Medium body with very soft carbonation. Toffee-like malts are there with good fruit forward hops, but not dominant. Very well-balanced and interesting take on a British pale. Lightly bitter finish with some piney, resinous notes.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

1908,"2015-01-16",3.6,"While I would generally say this is a rather standard, non-description English pale ale I would also add that it is quite well done and would not let you down upon having a glass. Lightly malty with crisp hops. Pleasant.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
1908,"2015-01-06",4.7,"Why talk about beer with the usual the aroma is this, and it looks like this?. I trust you can view the beer for yourself and draw your own conclusions. I drink this beer every time I wait at Wellington airport, which is every few months or so. It is a very English beer, in that you can sip at it for an hour or more, as you wait out your airport time (or are at your local pub, presumably with bowl of pickled things at hand). It is not unpleasant warm: it has a complex clove-like taste. The hops are sharp yet understated, like herringbone.","","pollololo"

1908,"2014-09-06",3.3,"It has a really nice, dusty aroma of grapefruits, rockmelon, musk stick and a hint of dust. The hops are prominent but very smooth in the mouth. The main letdown is that its a little watery and a little short.","AUSTRALIA","LesArgen"

1908,"2014-01-02",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2014 Bottle. Lightly hazed orange amber with a short head. Has a strong orange marmalade Cascade hop aroma with softer touches of pine resin, spice mix, celery seed, leafy greens and grapefruit softened slightly by a faint yeast note. Medium body, semi-sweet with moderate bitterness. Creamy and fluffy carbonation delivers juicy hop oils across the tongue in a velvet soft washing. Exceptionally clean with salivating juiciness brought on by nectary hops and Maris Otter-like malt (a guess but it has that pastry and cherry and toast character that I love in that malt). Lovely stuff beginning to end. ParrotDog is proving themselves adept at making clean, soft, characterful beers.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1908,"2013-12-30",3.2,"A body that wasnt, even from a lighter ABV I expected a little more from this beer. The Hops are well expressed and a bit of an ""Orangie"" note is the prevailing aroma. The saving grace really, a session beer aimed at being a top end session beer. I think it falls short in a few ways.","NEW ZEALAND","KyleCameron"

Taste is well balanced and straightforward combination of malt and hops. There is pleasant subtle malty sweetness overlaid by some prominent hops that give a citrusy tang to start and develop into a very nice bitter finish. A good beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Pyobon"

Smooth, easy drinking, rich subtly sweet ale carrying a lot of rich flavoursome hops.  This is a nice pale ale; not extravagant, not silly, just does what it says on the tin - hops, malt and smoothness. Nice indeed.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","buzz_and_hum"

Loads of grapefruit, greengage and, oddly enough, Lucozade aromas. Citrus and resin all over. A very easy palate to appreciate. There isnt a huge astringent burst, rather mellow golden tropical fruit and then tangy tangerine. The finish is more toward this motif without overbearing hops. Nicely balanced in other words. I rather like this.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
