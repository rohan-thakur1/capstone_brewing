3464,"2017-05-14",4.2,"Dark brown pour with mocha lacing. Smells strongly of slightly salted maple syrup, slight caramel, slight toffee sweetness, mild roasted coffee on the backend that you have to search for. The taste is more coffee forward than the smell, with the maple component taking a back seat. The maple component is light on the palate, but is accompanied with notes of mild smoke and slight leather. A malt component presents midway through, getting slightly stronger as the beer warms up. The 9.5% ABV presents as / covered by a roast bitterness, but does not overstay or overextend its welcome. The smell is definitely akin to the base MBCP beer, but the taste has a stronger coffee/bitter component to it. The mouthfeel is a bit creamier and noticeably heavier than it's base counterpart. Overall, it's a great brew, but I may actually prefer the base beer for these adjuncts, as the taste is too roast-heavy, which is necessary to cover up the increased ABV. And no, you can't compare this to Morning Wood, it's Barrel-aged big brother, as the barreling adds complexity along with oak and

3464,"2017-05-12",4.3,"2016 22 oz bottle. Pours nearly black in color and topped by a small layer of tan colored foam that shows good retention before slowly settling to a thin film and leaving streaks of lace on the glass. The aroma is amazing showing notes of fresh maple syrup, roasted coffee, chocolate, mocha, vanilla, and some smoked malts to go with the dark caramel and roasted malts. The flavor follows suit and shows a nice mix of all the flavors with the rich maple syrup, roasted coffee, milk chocolate, mocha, vanilla, and salty smokey bacon all playing a key role. There is just enough roast in there to add some balancing bitterness while the malts add a touch of smoothness. Full bodied and smooth with balanced carbonation that leads to a lengthy maple syrup and roasted coffee finish. No hint of alcohol at all in this one. The base imperial porter lends itself perfectly to all the additions. An outstanding beer that never disappoints and takes MBCP to a whole other level.

3464,"2016-06-22",4.2,"Bottle, new batch, shared by James on 6/10/16.Deep ebony, of indeterminable clarity with a tan head atop that is large and shows moderately strong-to-strong retention.After the disaster that was French Vanilla Militia (and most imperial stouts these days, it seems), I was not exactly chomping at the bit to try this, but what a pleasant surprise....dark chocolate combines with maple-like earthy-sweetness (that doesnt make much sense, I know) and a ton of raisins and vanilla to give a strong aroma but the dark chocolate-like roastiness is ever-present keeping the caramel, raisin, fudge and such from becoming too dominant. Coffee notes are pretty reserved and its not a mass of burnt, black, sharp french roast, thankfully. Fruitiness reminds of the best English-style Imperial stouts and there is no sign of the alcohol, in the nose.Even better, is the flavor, with prune, raisin and creme brulee balancing chocolate, light roast coffee and vanilla-tinged caramel. The flavors are all highly enjoyable and while its pretty sweet and fairly thick, both the tight carbonation and fair amount of attenuation coupled with the fruity acidity, make for a surprisingly balanced beer. On the finish of every sip, just as the fudge and caramel is about to take over, the raisin, prune and roasted barley notes dry things out considerably adding a bright zip to the end. No alcohol noted. Very happily finished my glass and then some. Easy drinking.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

There isnt a whole lot of coffee, but Im definitely getting the chocolate and maple. This one should be damn good. The flavor is really chocolatey and mapley up front. There is a resounding bacon aspect to this that just moves in and dominates for a while. Nice roast, good bitterness. Its got a sweetness on the back on the a decently bitter roast. The mouth feel is lighter tha. I wanted. Medium to heavy body with a nice soft carbonation and a lingeringly bacon-influenced aftertaste.

Intense coffee without ever being acidic. It rounds itself out with a touch of maple and some smokiness that mellows the coffee into an earthiness that is quite pleasant. A little over the top at first, but the full nose is quite nice. Like the nose, the coffee taste is intense and almost astringent. The acidity of it is just a little too much at first. The roasted malts mellow it, surprisingly, and give it a nice touch of smoke in the end. The maple is barely a hint, if I can even detect it at all. It just seems to be there as something that keeps it drinkably sweet at such a high ABV and coffee content. The coffee intense and maybe a little too intense. The rest of the beer drinks nicely, especially for 11.5%, which is how FB listed it on the board. Medium bodied. Nicely balanced except for the coffee.

3464,"2012-09-20",4.9,"Original batch, kindly poured by the man himself into a FB snifter

A: Pours a big syrupy black color with a small khaki colored head. Retention isnt great, but with a high ABV it still looks evil

S: Damn, tons of sweet maple, coffee, and some burnt bacon. Simply amazing. The maple adds a whole new dimension to this beer that I never thought was possible

T: Much more balanced and refined that I expected. The bacon is less noticeable in the flavor, but the maple adds a pleasant flavor and balances the dark roast coffee. Thick body and dangerously drinkable. Not too much hop presence, but then again, thats not what you would want in a beer like this.

MF: Thick and chewy feel to it, sweet maple/coffee finish, low-medium carbonation. Alcohol is not detectable.

O: Overall, this is an amazing beer worthy of its hype. I have not had but one chance to get to FB since I am at school in SC since they have become a world-class brewery, but I will definitely make the effort now. Great job Funky Buddha!","Parkland, Florida, Florida, USA","scottyshades"
3464,"2012-08-05",4.2,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter.  This bottle is about a year old.

Wide Awake pours a dark brown mahogany color with almost no head formation on the initial pour.

The aroma still jumps out of the glass.  Bursts of espresso, sweet maple syrup, smoke, and vanilla all come through.  With the age of the bottle I would not be surprised if the coffee smelled even better fresh, but it still smells incredible.  Each whiff unveils a little bit more complexity.  This is definitely a winner.

The flavor is huge.  There coffee flavor manifests itself in the beginning of the sip, with what seems to be a few different types of exquisite espresso.  Sweetness runs rampant with maple syrup flavors coming through during each part of the sip, with a little bit of vanilla as well.  A thorough smoked malt flavor comes through representing the bacon.  There is no concern of it being too smokey, a fear I often have with beers that use smoked malts.  What is truly amazing is how each sip provides a new angle on the combination of coffee, maple syrup, and smoke.  Each flavor develops more thoroughly with each sip, making this a glass that never gets boring.

Each sip is truly a full bodied treat.  It is so thick and viscous, with a light and creamy carbonation.  It is definitely sweet, sticky, and syrupy, and more than a little over the top.

This beer impressed me even more than the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, which is saying something.  I would love to have a fresh bottle to compare.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
3464,"2012-07-06",4.4,"Thanks a bunch for the rare tick Sean. This bottle is about a year old and its held up incredibly. Pours a brownish black in color with almost no head formation. Nose is Maple Bacon Coffee Porter on steroids, the coffee, maple, and vanilla all pop quite a bit. There is some smoke character there as well. Flavor follows the nose only its heavier on the maple syrup and bacon character. The maple syrup lingers nicely on the finish. Nice and smooth mouthfeel, not acrid at all from the coffee, no booze, almost silky. Great beer, Funky Buddha kills another beer.

Cant believe how close it smells like to the name.

3464,"2012-02-01",4.7,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2012 WAIM pours a pitch, oily, black with very little head at all.  But lets just forget what this beer looks like because as youre pouring this beer your nostrils will be attacked with huge aromas.  One of the strongest beers Ive ever smelled in my life.  The aroma is full and I mean full of maple syrup.  When I mean full of it, its hard to explain.  I could walk into the other room and still get a little bit of the smell.  Putting my nose up to it I got more.  A nice bit of smokiness comes up, followed by coffee, roasted malt, and chocolate.  Its impressive.  Its huge.  Its hard to explain on a blog. 

The taste is just as good and just as big.  Once again the maple syrup dominates and I really wonder just how much they used for this beer.  The flavor is dominated by sweetness.  As the maple calms down a bit youll pick up the other flavors.  Coffee, smokiness, and chocolate.  This beer is huge but the ingredients totally cover up any alcohol that is in this beer.  Its breakfast in a bottle. Its a total sipper.  One to sit back and enjoy over an hour or so.  I was questioning myself the whole time, is this really beer?  Awesome.

I was torn whether or not to open this bad boy right away or to sit on it for a special occasion.  After some comments I decided to open it last night.  Man am I glad I did.  The second I opened the bottle the maple syrup and coffee smell filled the room.  I was a little worried after all the hype that I was gonna get a bad bottle but the inital smell is all good.  I poured it into a darkness snifter and it poured black with some brown head that went away very fast.  The smell is of roasted coffee and maple with some smokeyness.  The taste is great alot smoother than I thought it was gonna be its like breakfast in a beer.  Mouthfeel could be a little thicker in my opinion(if you wanna split hairs).  This beer was a little bittersweet because it was such an amazing beer and I wish I could have share it with someone, but Im also happy I got the whole bottle to myself (minus a couple sips for my wife).  After all was said and done my hands still reeked of maple syrup and my wife said my breath stank of dark coffee.  ALL AROUND AN AMAZING BEER!!!!

Tones of smoke, complex coffee character, maple syrup, dark fruits, dark chocolate, asphalt, salty/sweet liquorice, sweet currant candy and well-integrated hops.

This one pours a near lifeless black, medium Im body. Right off the bat you get hit in the face with aromas of maple syrup pancakes, smoked sausage, coffee, vanilla, and sweet chocolates. Crazy nose and very strong. You can smell it from ten feet away. The flavors are a nice mix of maple syrup drenched breakfast sausages, chocolate, vanilla beans, and light coffee. While very good, I may soon be Diabetic. The sugar is out of this world. Its drinkable but only at maybe half a bottle at a time. I cant take that much sugar.

S: Maple syrup and burnt coffee. A bit of smoke and roast. Not particularly inviting or well developed.

T: Like the nose, coffee (both roasted and burnt) takes center stage. A bit of smoked malts, maple syrup, brown sugar, and chocolate.

M: Fairly thin for as much malt in the flavor. A weak, sloppy finish. Slightly over carbonated.

No real lacing. Aromas are a heavy roasty coffee, some cream, cocoa, heavy roast and espresso. Rich with some maple, cream, vanilla, and mocha. A lot going on here, with a heavy coffee dominance. Initial is medium bodied with a decadent mocha feel, coffee, roast. Lots of chocolate, hazelnuts, caramel, and maple. Touches of vanilla, with a good flavorful appeal. Id say the mocha and coffee are dominant.. Ya think? Cream, espresso, chocolate. Finish is powerful lingering mocha and espresso. I wouldnt say its complex, its just very powerful. Coffee fans (especially Dessert Coffee fans) should try this. Its pretty rich. Special? No. But flavorful and interesting. Coffee grounds, mocha, some real lingering maple essence sticks around.

Nose gives a lot more smoke then the regular Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, which was something that I could careless about as I do not enjoy smoke. In this beer though it fits in perfectly.

This beer is a GrandSlam Breakfast (minus the eggs) in a glass. Maple Syrup is present, Smoke is there, and SLAMMM a huge hit of Black Coffee! Everything is exceptionally well balanced.

3464,"2011-06-27",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2015 Draft This beer rocks! Pours black with a small, creamy, khaki head. The nose is all about pure, deep roast Cuban or Kona coffee accompanied by gobs of maple syrup and a subtle nuance of crispy, smoked bacon. Full-bodied with a velvety mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Huge Cuban espresso and maple syrup flavor without the cloying sweetness I feared may rear its ugly head when I first heard they would be imperializing the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. Balanced nicely by what I can only assume are black malt, singed coffee and hops. Burnt, acrid, moderately bitter, espresso finish. Way too drinkable for a high abv beer.

3464,"2011-06-26",4.5,"Draft at the Buddha. Long awaited, this lives up to the hype. Pours a pitch black, little head. Nose assaults you with waves of maple syrup, a little whiff of smoke and roasted malt and coffee. The body is huge yet this beer is so drinkable its scary. I chugged this pretty quick and had absolutely no problem doing so. Flavor wise there is alot of maple up front and the coffee dominates the back end with the roasted malt taking up the mid palate. Very layered, something I find in alot of the Buddha beers. There are a few things missing though. The smoke in the nose and in the original maple bacon is not here, it has been dominated by the coffee, which is the other issue. A tad to much coffee here. Such a well done beer, and knowing the guys at the Buddha they will continue to tweak this, and Ill probably have to change my rating.
