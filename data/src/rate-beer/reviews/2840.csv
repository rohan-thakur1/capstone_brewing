2840,"2016-12-30",3.5,"I was struck by the aroma. For whatever reason, it had the capacity to send my mind back to a little store that I used to go to when I visited my grandparents at Fort Myers Beach in Florida. How many decades has it been since I thought of that place? But the aroma did it: it made me think of the smell of plastic toys that I could buy there, combined as it did with the smell of the beach air and sand. The flavor didnt have nearly so pronounced effect, but I was pleased with the general quality of this beer. On tap at brewery.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Flavor is pretty nuanced. Mild grassy bitterness. Honeycomb. Peppered melon. Lovely, expressive malt. Perfect carb. Effortlessly drinkable. Fair States lagers are fantastic, this is no exception.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
2840,"2015-10-08",3.6,"Straw yellow, clear. Clinging white head. Grass fed butter with honeyed cereals in the aroma; sugar cookie, lemon, and fresh sourdough. Simple, clean flavor of dry grasses, peppercorns, and crackery Pilsner malt. Bay leaf, minor tea like notes, suffiently herbal, not especially floral. Quickly drying, light palate.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
2840,"2015-09-13",3.7,"Two 8 oz. pours, on tap at the brewerys taproom in Nordeast Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 9-10-15. The first pour was of the standard Pils, the second of that Pils randalized with Citra hops (Fair State Pils with Citra Hops). I will review them individually and then combine the score. Standard Pils: Pours a clear, pale gold with beige head. Nice, citric aroma. Really good pilsner smell. Dry and floral flavor. Really nice in taste. A well above average pilsner. Crisp and lively as well as frothy in the palate. Light to medium body. Really good lager palate effects. Very well done. 7/3/7/4/15=>3.6. Pils with Citra Hops: Pours a clear gold (darker than the standard Pils) with a moderate amount of long-lasting, off-white head. Produces good lacing. Looks good. Smells great. Mostly the standard pilsner hops smell with a dank, Citra kick. Nice, tangy, hoppy flavor. Lovely taste. Soft in the palate. Not as crisp as it should be. The Citra elevates it enough in aroma and flavor to make up for the drop in palate from the randalization. 8.4.8.3.15=>3.8. Combined: 7/3/8/4/15=>3.7.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
2840,"2015-05-19",3.3,"On tap at Fair State. Definitely a quality pilsener. Malty, earthy. More malty than hoppy, but still this pils has more character than most.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
2840,"2015-05-11",3.5,"Draft. Straw yellow in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are of soft pilsner malt, earth, wet stones, and roses. Really nice clean and developed malt flavor to this one, along with more herbal hops and earth. Light bodied. I was expecting the hops to be a bit more punchy, but this is still some tasty stuff. Moreish.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
2840,"2015-04-17",3.5,"Straw color and a small head that laces the glass. Noble hop aroma, grass. Very dry, bitter flavor. this gets close to a Czech style pils. Good.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
