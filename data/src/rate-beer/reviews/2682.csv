2682,"2017-06-22",4.4,"1 finger off-white head.
Very dark brown coloured beer.
Aroma is coffee, brown sugar, vanilla, barrel and some dried dark fruits. Absolutely stunning for a Brown Ale. 
Taste is rich chocolate, nuts, vanilla and delicious fruity coffee. An obvious lactose sweetness joins in at the back.
Big, thick body on this one, on par with a single stout. Creamy and velvety smooth. Pretty heavy sweetness but never goes overboard. Low carbonation. Low bitterness, both coffee and hop-wise. Wouldve liked a bit more of that. 
Overall: Wow. Just wow. I had my doubts about this considering its a brown ale and I usually dont get along with light, dark ales but this absolutely knocks it out off the park. Shouldve known better than to doubt anything dark made by Founders. Fantastic beer.","Malmö, SWEDEN","EerieDrinks"

Very smooth and flavorful.","New York, TURKEY","trapped"
2682,"2017-06-19",3.8,"Bottle provided by Founders for review. The first pour, into a suitable goblet, is a deep dark coffee brown, with a foamy head this side of tan colored. The smell is almost saccharine, but thankfully not too strong, lending a big note of mocha java. Just a bit of roasty malt behind it.
The taste loses the sweet from the nose, trading in for a warm, alcoholic strong beer taste. There is definitely a blonde roast coffee taste, which goes to one part of my head while the alcohol goes to another. Part of that might be due to the hot weather Ive been not enjoying. I detect very little hop bitterness, unless thats what Im sensing at the malt roast. Either way, theres clearly something keeping the sweetness and alcohol from swarming my senses. However, there is a slightly sugary cola flourish at the end.
Another strong, dark beer from Founders that works best as dessert. It would be worth getting a couple of bottles for cellaring and tasting at intervals.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

This is rather on the heavy side and just a bit hot but not too sweet so relatively drinkable for its gravity. There is a nice nutty malt character underpinning which keeps it from just being a coffee bomb.

Theres really not much else in the nose, which is fine. I would think a brown ale is a good beer to show off the aroma of the coffee. Transparent dark mahogany body with a medium, very persistent light tan head. Very attractive. Starts with a little metallic astringency, before plenty of coffee flavor comes through in the middle. Light roasted bitterness later on. This is all about the coffee, and they picked the perfect beer vehicle to show off the coffee. Lots of breweries will fuck this up and make it a totally acidic, astringent mess, but they did quite well with this. The finish is just a tad dry for me.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Iced coffee, earthen accents and toasted depths surf a caramelized nut base in this velvety, creamy concoction.

-The nose is unadulterated coffee.
-The mouthfeel is super smooth.
-Finish is lightly bitter, with leafy nods and coffee lengths.
-All flavors are harmonious and captivating.
-Alcohol is a no show in the flavor profile.

Roasted coffee aroma, perhaps some chocolate, but dominated by the coffee. Feel is actually moderate, but seemed thin at first... that is perhaps due to expectation based on the dark color and coffee aroma. After pausing to consider this is a brown and not a stout, the feel is appropriate to style, but, OTOH, I cant escape the notion that this is really a coffee stout and that the notion of an ""imperial brown"" is just what the brewer called it. Nice malty, nutty flavor transitioning to a bitter coffee finish. Very much a coffee dominated beer in total. Overall, enjoyable, but not a beer youd kick back and have 2 or 3.

The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a sly spider web lacing rounding about after the head dissipated nicely.

The taste was basically the same with a nice balance between the sweetness to the roastiness. Subtle dry roasty aftertaste and a sly wet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sesionable feel to me. Slight stickiness in the feel, but not overbearing.

2682,"2016-05-20",4.5,"BOD 3/31/16. Dark brown porter like pour. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Quite outstanding nose of rich fresh coffee, light chocolate, a whiff of earthy hops and a solid malt base with caramel.

Heavy light body that is smooth and hints at being slick. As it warms, body transitions to light medium with a subtle creaminess. World class carbonation / body balance with a strong mid-palate effervescence and a rousing finely bubbled prickly finish. The effervescent finish allows the flavors to separate and linger very, very well.

The flavor profile is world class. Intensity, complexity and balance all are near perfection. It begins with rich coffee then flows into a mild bitter middle that has an earthy quality. From the midpoint on, complexity is evident as a mild sweetness arrives allowing for separation. Caramel, chocolate, hints of black strap molasses and a very subtle dark fruit note arrive. The finish provides a delightful fade of lingering coffee over the slowly receding sweet base.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

2682,"2016-05-01",4.3,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy chocolate, lighter caramel, roasted nuts, and coffee. It pours a dark brown with some red transparency when held to the light. It has a large khaki head that has very good retention before finally settling to a thick film. There is some soapy webbing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate-heavy chocolate and lighter caramel. The finish has moderate coffee, cream, and roasted nuts. Its medium bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, this is incredibly tasty and way too easy to drink for 9.2%. I really hope there are plans to continue to bottle this every year.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

2682,"2016-04-30",4.2,"Darker than most Browns in the glass, Cleveland or otherwise. More like a Porter or stout.
Nose is deep sweet malts and quality roasted coffee. Anytime the flavor tries to get to sweet the roast in the coffee and slight hop bitterness keeps it in check.

2682,"2016-04-29",3.5,"12 oz. bottle from Liquor Barn (Jefferson Commons); shared with my Boo. Aroma: Big coffee roast with a lesser, but present amount of chocolate, caramel and spiced toast. Appearance: Somewhat hazy dark copper brown pour with a foamy tan head that settles into a creamy ring. Flavor: Coffee all the way up front with bolder roast and subtle fruity esters; malts come out more midway on, and maintain some caramel/spiced toast; the finish is semi-dry with a light to moderate bitterness and some definite alcohol burn. Palate: Medium body, slick texture, soft carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: Pretty good stuff, but from a brewery already stacked with great coffee-centric offerings, this falls slightly short.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

Pours fairly hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big nutty roasted coffee, milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasted brown bread, light smoke/dark fruit, herbal, wood, and roast/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of coffee, dark/roast/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big nutty roasted coffee, milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasted brown bread, light smoke/dark fruit, herbal, wood, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/woody hop and roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of nutty coffee, milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasted brown bread, herbal, wood, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of coffee, dark/roast/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from hop/roast bitterness, that increases through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and full-ish bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an insane imperial brown ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of coffee, dark/roast/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV.

2682,"2016-02-06",4.1,"On draft at Founders. The pour is a nice cola brown color with hints of ruby and orange poking through with a larger white foamy head and no lace as it falls to a bubbly collar. The aroma is magnificent. There is so much coffee it's incredible. That's all you need in a brown. Rather than roasted malt, it's roasted coffee. Incredible. The flavor is much of the same. Heavy coffee that does fade to a light caramel. There is a decent sweet brown character to the flavor and it's a little different. The mouth feel is a touch light and the aftertaste is heavy in the roasted coffee. It's a solid brew. If this was a little thicker, it would incredible! Very good brew though.

2682,"2011-01-03",3.9,"Founders Sumatra brown. Growler thanks to the neiweems once again.  
Super!... Pours a darker caramel toffee hue with a thin to medium  
frothy head... Aroma is akin to a breakfast stout coffee influence  
which cannot be complained about in the slightest. Coffee forward with  
a good degree of roast... Flavors are coffee forward to an assertive  
extent, roasty while meshing well with a caramel malt and a semi-spicy  
rye breadiness. Sweeter sugary tones through the middle while pushing  
through towards the finish. A very light bitterness comes into play  
very late in the finish. Carbonation is semi-lively and jiving well  
with its body. Could have been a touch less sweet but its a minor  
quibble. A little one dimensional really but pretty good stuff overall especially from someone who enjoys their coffee infused brews.

This is a phenomenal beer, and truly original.  Take the smooth, oily roasted coffee flavors from their Breakfast Stout, and mix them in with the malty sweetness of a Dirty Bastard (minus the 60+ IBUs), and you have the Sumatra Mt. Brown.  Low hop bitterness, thick mouthfeel, TONS of pleasant coffee notes and a delicate sweet finish.  I predict that this would be their next big hit if they started bottling it.
