974,"2017-03-17",3.9,"Intense head formation when poured. Haze-ish yellow colour with some residue on the bottom, would probably be almost clear without it. Aroma is very very refreshing. Fruity and wheat-like notes dominate, floral, some grass and citrus fruit. Hops really shines through. Light and zesty on the palate. Flavour is of a very hoppy Belgian character. Surprisingly bitter, with fruity and wheaty notes in the foreground. Grassy, herbal hoppy flavours are also very dominant. FInishes bitter and herbal, a little bit boozy.

Nose is complex and shows at first strong citrus notes (grapefruit, lime), then honey floral and when it warms the spicy character of Belgian yeast and some malt. Mouthfeel is oily, carbonation is lively. Starts with assertive bitter flavors of grapefruit and lime peel, some short lasting tartness sensation then comes the sweeter malty and yeasty base, ends with a persistent bitter final. While unbalanced towards hops, it is a flavourful, complex, yet pleasant and refreshing brew. Well done again Schigi!","","TheHolyLance"
974,"2014-08-11",3.9,"Pale yellow cloudy pour, head is abundant and persistent, theres some yeast sediment.

Carbonation is very high, perharps too high, but resulting mouthfeel is very good. Somewhere in the aroma and the taste a faint winey character can be noticed, but nothing strong or unpleasant.
