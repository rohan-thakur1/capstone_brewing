Naturtrüb dunkel im Glas, nicht schlecht, aber auch nicht wirklich gut ausschauend. Das Aroma ist verheißungsvoll fruchtig, malzig und hopfig. Im Antrunk dann sensationell vollmundig mit einer Leichtigkeit, die nie und nimmer einen Alk-Gehalt von 7,5% erahnen läßt! Die Malzigkeit ist hier lecker fruchtig ausgelegt und im Abgang kommt eine schöne Hopfenherbe hervor. Tolles Bier, genialer Schützen-Bock! Ketterer sind besserer! :D
Großes Dankeschön an quack-duck für diesen Nektar!!

4184,"2012-02-13",3.7,"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and its not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog!

Im Glas steht ein leuchtend rotbraunes Bier mit mittelgrober Malzbierkrone. Sieht einfach super aus! Der Geruch ist eher zurückhaltend. Röstmalzig würzig, leicht kaffeartig  bitter. Der Antrunk fällt bitterhopfig würzig aus, angenehm röstig bitter zudem. Das Bier ist ja mal wirklich absolut rezent! Klasse! Der Abgang zeigt sich kaffebitter, karamellig, sehr langgezogen, so dass die geilen Aromen noch lange nachhallen. Ein absolut gelungener Bock!","Merzkirchen, RLP, GERMANY","Grima"
4184,"2010-10-08",4.1,"Bottle 33cl from Quack-duck, thanks very much. Brown ale with low head. Smell is amazing with malty, toasted and chocolate notes. Aroma is malty, sweet, bread like, cereals, nice hopy notes, caramel, some chocolate notes too. A fantastic bock, creamy, well balanced, very smooth, alcohol is fantastically hidden, a grate beer, wonderful body, near to some great dubble belgian beers, with spicy notes, thanks Stephan.","Strasbourg (Alsace), FRANCE","jaghana"

4184,"2010-02-25",3.8,"Bottled 33cl. Courtesy of Quack-Duck. It pours a beautiful nut brown beer with a nice little beige head. Impressive, deeply inviting leafy aroma of pralines, cocoa powder, blueberries, tobacco, candied apricot and plums. Sweet, slightly smoky taste. Wonderfully chocolatey and fruity (raspberries, blueberries). The alcohol tickles on the tongue slightly- nice. Great balance between malt, yeast and hops. Medium to full bodied. Average carbonation. Complex, very pleasant and interesting with plenty of character. Salty finish which is reminiscent of crackers, dried apricots and a huge amount of figs. A top notch dunkler bock. I reveled in every sip. Thanks a lot Quack-Duck!","SWITZERLAND","Embrouille"
4184,"2010-02-04",3.6,"Swing top bottle from Quack-Duck, thanks! Dark brown color. Malt aroma, with roast and a hint of chocolate cake. Malty roasty chocolate cake flavor. Sweet with a hint of grass. Full bodied. Excellent bock, deceptively drinkable.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
4184,"2008-04-03",4.1,"Big thanks to quack-duck for the bottle! Looks good, the beer in the glass also. Very much foam for a bock. Tastes very strong, but not alcoholic. Modest malty, well balanced finish. A little bit fruity. Really good beer!","GERMANY","kappldav123"

4184,"2008-01-28",3.9,"(33cl swing top bottle, courtesy of Quack-Duck) Cloudy, brown colour with a massive light-beige foamy head. Light-sweet, toasty malty nose with red berries and an aromatic, lemony, almost piney hops character. Moderately sweet flavour, medium to full bodied with a slightly crispy carbonation. Slightly toasty malty and fruit-accented taste (red berries, raspberries) taste; medium-dry, fruity and malty finish with a well-rounded herbal and a bit piney hoppy blend. Strange to find this one in Germany, cause it is rather uncommon by German standards. Quaffable brew, reminds me of a Sweet Stout (23.01.08).","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
4184,"2007-11-10",3.5,"bottle. Brown colour, cloudy, persistent head. Aroma of beries and chocolate. Made with stout yeast. Fruity flavour, full-bodied, hints of chocolate, cocoa-powder. The flavour reminds me strongly of a Belgian or Norhern French Brune. The high alcohol volume is well disguised. Very moreish. A delicious winter warmer.","Down South, GERMANY","Quack-Duck"
4184,"2005-04-07",3.7,"Bottle.  Sweet chocolate malt with strong tannins as well.  Dark reddish brown color - slightly cloudy with little head.   Sweet chocolate malt balanced with tannic astringent flavor - not overwhelming.  A very nice bock.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
