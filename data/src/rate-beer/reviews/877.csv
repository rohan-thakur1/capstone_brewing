877,"2016-02-27",3.3,"Bottle shared at One Canada Square as Gekkeikan Yuzu Nigori Sake, 7%. Picked up in a Japanese shop. Separates in the bottle, so requires mixing. Thanks to Leighton for demonstrating the technique. Milky opaque pour, leaves a creamy dotted scummy residue on the glass. Aroma is key lime pie and Calpol. Body is smooth with low carbonation. Taste is pretty sweet yet dry, chalky and powdery, sour yuzu, meringue, tea, touch of booze. Certainly an interesting beverage. Pretty dry and powdery.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

877,"2015-08-08",3.5,"500 ml tall bottle bought at ParkNShop Superstore in Fanling.
Cloudy, hazy milky off-white colour mixed with lots of sake rice particles; Fragrant and sweet aroma of glutinous rice wine, with strong yuzu , perfume, sugar, light mashed pear fresh, floral and light alcohol; Mid to strong sweet taste of soupy sake rice , with strong yuzu tea, honey, rice particles, tartness, petals, pear puree, light alcohol and liquorices; 
Close to light body, Slightly slick and starchy palate; Mouth feel is a thinned Gekkeikan Nigori fused with yuzu tea concentrate. Lots of citrus mixed with honey plus Nigoris starchy rice turn into a very easy to drink Sake-yazu tea mixture. Sakes boozy edge is toned down even more so than the regular Nigori yet the booze-liquorice finish is still here. Sweet but pretty nice! Wet after taste; Starchy and fruity sweet to mouth.

Comments: This toned-down, yazu tea-heavy Nigori must be made for casual, non-committed drinkers in mind. Its so easy and refreshing to go down yet without much knock on even at 7% ABV. Its heretic, but damn its so nice for cooling down Summer heat like today. A perfect lady killer, you have been warned!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
