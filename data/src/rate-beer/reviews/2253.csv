2253,"2017-06-09",4.3,"5%ABV. Lambic.

Poured out light amber brown. 18SRM.

Nose has grape soda and fresh boile barley aromas. The fruity aromas bloom a little more as itÂ’s allowed to breathe. Straight out of the bottle, the predominant aroma was that of freshly boiled barley water. The aroma of sweet ume and just ripening plums starts to come to the fore as it sits at room temperature.

Mouthfeel is juicy. Palate has nice clean barley flavors which you pick up at the end with a sweet clean flavor with a hint of starch. Front end is juicy with the sour and sweet of ripe ume and just ripening plums and cherries come up quite nicely. No obvious hops.

The finish is clean and predominantly that of fresh boiled barley grains.

Overall in the nose and in the palate, sweet and sour are balanced perfectly for a very pleasing fruity sour ale experience. Likely one of the most approachable spontans ever.
