3039,"2016-10-16",4.2,"Dark barley wine by Emelisse, lot A. Thin and loosely structured, off-white head leaving a thin moussy rim on the edge and some thin veils of beige foam in the middle; colour is a deep, warm, ruby red-hued brownish bronze, very dark and certainly much darker than average for the style, but still translucent, like a quadrupel. Intense and perfumey, enticing aroma of Belgian chocolates, woody tannins and vanilla-like oak, lots of bourbon nicely interwoven with the rest, milk chocolate, marzipan, cashew nuts, candied cherries, toffee, hint of beef broth, honey liqueur, brandy, gingerbread, kahlua, lots of candied fig, some dry earth, hint of tea, marmelade, ripe blue plum, ruby port, chocolate cake, amaretto, Haagse hopjes, brown sugar melting on hot pancakes, liquorish candy. Concentrated candied sweet onset, lots of candied date and raisin, ripe blue plum and blackcurrant with a slight sourish touch, very vague beefy umami somewhere, lots of residual brown sugar sweetness but nothing sticky; soft carbo but just right for a barley wine, very vinous, oily, supple but thick mouthfeel, layers of caramelly, lightly nutty and deeply chocolatey malt sweetness in the middle while the candied fruit sweetness persists on top of it. Finish turns things around with a drying, tannin-rich, very agreeable woodiness releasing some oaky vanilla retronasally; unsurprisingly for such a beer, this is followed by a heavy dosis of warming, liqueurish and brandy-like alcohol, though I get no astringency whatsoever. A herbal, structurally important but inobtrusive herbal hop bitterish touch does the rest, with a slightly peppery character to it which is hard to distinguish from the peppery qualities of the alcohol itself. In any case: this is a beautiful, rich sipper, one of the best dark barley wines I ever had, with a heavy load of almost furniture-like woodiness contrasting with the basic candied and caramelly sweetness. Complex, perfumey, multi-layered slow sipping beer: this is close to divine, at least if you like your beers strong, vinous, sweet and dark. Easily recommendable for quadrupel lovers as well and doubtlessly a beer which benefits from a couple of years of cellaring.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
