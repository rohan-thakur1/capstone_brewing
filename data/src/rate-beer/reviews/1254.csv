Le malt sert dassis confortable et fiable à ce cocktail de fruits qui na cependant rien dune Pale Ale. Bonne quantité de malts caramels et de sucres céréaliers qui balancent à merveille la légèreté des houblons. Cocktail dune grande fraîcheur en bouche où les houblons apportent à la fois une importante amertume et un profil aromatique des plus agréables. Encore une belle présence de grains germés et entiers dans cette bière dune grande buvabilité.

Oh, Hildegard, you have been naughty, havent you, putting all those hops in the vicars bitter? Time for your spanking, you naughty nun, you! Lets find out what those stockings are attached to, anyway... (ahem) Where was I? Oh, yes, beer! Not nun-spanking. Not at all. On to the beer! And what a beer! No hesitation in saying this is the best ESB Ive ever had. I am loving this brewery - their witbier wasnt anything special, but when it comes time to bring the hops, they bring em in spades. Lots of complexity in the aroma, nicely balanced bitter and malt on the tongue, and a finish that honestly reminds me of nothing so much as unsweetened iced tea. Lovely. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

1254,"2012-06-15",3.7,"Haha I had lots of local ales in England and Scotland before joining this site but since I retried the Fullers ESB recently and loved it I thought I should from now on consider that the standard-bearer. I then go to the BJCP guidelines and it says ""Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fullers ESB clones."" so never mind. This is certainly the hoppiest example of its style Ive had yet; if it were made by an English brewer I think it would be labelled an IPA. However when I plug my nose and take a sip the sweet seems stronger than the bitter. The latest three Driftwood beers Ive had -- the saison, the altbier, and this -- are much more similar than youd expect. Not getting much of a biscuity flavour here, the only thing setting it apart are the English hops (which Im loving) which are painted across the typical well-crafted Driftwood canvas. For a moment I thought the finish was hot but thats pine (EDIT: No theres definitely warming alcohol here). Mild diacetyl. Good brew.","Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA","WheatKing"

The look: Slightly cloudy dark golden body topped by a medium off-white head with medium retention
In long: Nose is very aromatic with a ton of juicy leafy hops, pine tree notes.  Taste has a fair amount of toasted sweet cereals, half honey, half caramel.  A few dried fruits.  A lot of fruity hops, grassy hops, leafy hops, piney hops.  Finish is medium bitter, medium dry.  Carbonation is a lot of very small bubbles.  For anybody who was ever served a real ESB in England this is not much of an ESB.  More like an American IPA with an enlgish hops twist.  Whatever it is I thought it was excellent, tasty and very sessionnable.  One of the very best Canadian west-cost beer Ive had.  Wow, I rarely praise western Canadian beer but this is awesome.

1254,"2010-02-21",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2016 On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a hazy orange with a small white head. Nose brings out lots of oranges, resinous hops and British caramel malt. Flavour is along the same lines, with loads of resinous hops, caramel malt, British bready malt and oranges. Not an authentic ESB, but more like an IPA. Resinous and orangey on the finish, with ample sweetness. Very nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
