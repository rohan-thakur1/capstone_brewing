Pours murky yellow color with a thick white head. Aroma is strong wheaty with subtle spice notes, apricot, fair amount of hops too, lemon and toffee fudge. Flavor is sweet with toffee and wheat, caramel, some malts on the background, lots of vanilla on the aftertaste. Maybe a bit too sweet but quite quaffable Wheat Ale. Pleasant creamy mouthfeel.
