280,"2012-12-30",2.8,"This 09-05 bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of no head clear colored bubbles that were and left behind a uncarbonated . The mild aroma was polished rice. The mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mediumly tingly finish with a soft dry aftertaste. The mild flavor contained notes of mild nail polish vinous and semi-sweet. It has a very mild alcohol burn to it.  An OK Sake typical and nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

280,"2008-03-15",2.8,"(300 ml bottle, thanks rigk!) Oily pear color, pretty much clear. Butter, pear, wood, alcohol scent. Pear, hazel nut and alcohol taste. Warming alcohol. Alcohol and nutty aftertaste.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
280,"2008-03-03",1.8,"Honestly, I have no idea how to rate this. Bottle. Totally clear, no head at all. Potato and rice aroma, with alcohol. Some apples in flavor, but most of all alcohol, rice and potato peels. I have no idea how this is supposed to be, and I dont feel like trying many sakes after this...","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
280,"2007-02-04",2.8,"Bottle. Aroma  is rice, wet cardboard. Flavour is rice, alcohol, mild, wet card board. Weird taste but still drinkable.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","gunnfryd"
280,"2006-12-31",2.5,"Bottle. My second time ever to taste sake. This is really not enough experience to rate this, but you got to start somewhere. The body is pale and clear, I really cant see anything wrong with this, but believe I should try to follow the more experienced rater and go for the more average 3-point appearance. The aroma is strong; the first impression  really reminds me about a bad moonshine experiment from the deep, dark woods of Norway. A little more detailed analysis of this is a distinctive alcohol flavor, alcohol with fusel. It could also give a feeling of sweet overcooked rice and old, wet, moldy newspapers. Flavor gives much the same impression as the aroma. Not a very pleasant experience but interesting. I really dont know what you are expected to eat together with this, but we tried with some salmon, and the sake actually tasted better.  Have to sample some other sakes later, particularly together with someone more experienced.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
280,"2006-12-22",3.3,"300 ml bottle.  Crystal clear.  Aroma of pears, melon, light yeastiness and some sweet tapioca.  A hint of soft spice and perfumey floral notes.  Heathery sweetness.  Soft texture with pear, melon and pepper flavour.  Lightly alcoholic but still balanced and smooth.  Tapioca and fruit with an aromatic light fruitiness.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
280,"2005-10-23",2.2,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2008 Bottled. I am not a sake fan, but when I got the opportunity to taste this one, I had to give it a try. Aroma is sweet, with notes that reminds me of cold,  overcooked rice, and wet cardboard. It is clear, and with a yellowish color. Flavour has alcohol, rice and some hints of fruit. Should probably taste more sakes and really get to like it before starting to rate them... (051022)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
280,"2005-04-12",2.9,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2005 Very light; sweet aroma. Slight alcohol scent. Not much taste at first and the alcohol is a little overpowering, though the alcohol bite does not linger long like other mid-qualityJunmais. Must be rolled in mouth for a while before the subtle apple/pear flavors appear. Not a bad drink, have had much worse.","Nampa, Idaho, USA","IdahoJizake"
280,"2005-03-07",3.0,"Bottle @ Sakura Sushi in Eagle, IDClear, light beige, no legs. Nose of light melon & pear with  lots of alcohol. Neutral taste with a light alcohol burn. I should have heeded austinpowers advice but it was there to drink so I had it. Doesnt really live up to other Nippon Junmais.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
280,"2004-02-01",2.5,"A mild papery aroma and a yellowish color in the glass.  A slight hint of sourness (very faint) and a taste of dry, astringent, acidic almost winey grain.  A noticeable alcohol burn right up front that also lingers.  A real disappointment.  Don't bother with their Nigori, either.  If you're in the market for a legit Japanese sake that's got complexity and smoothness, you'd best avoid the Hitori Musume.  I taste this crap so you don't have to.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
