3304,"2013-08-27",3.8,"On tap at GTMW 2013 - Missed this one at last years GTMW so I made sure to seek it out this year. Pours pale yellow with a foamy white head. Nose is gentle honey malt, light floral hops, and grainy malt. Taste is real grainy and yeasty, with honey and light floral hops. Yum. Smooth, fluffy, and gentle in the mouth. Want this in 6 packs.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

3304,"2013-05-05",4.1,"For a zwickel it is a bit clean and unfiltered in the appearance but the flavor is straight up yeasty/fresh baked bread and noble hops. A fantastic brew.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

3304,"2012-04-29",3.4,"After a few other high octane offerings, and a dynamite meal at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL., I thought that I should refresh the palate and finish the evening with something very sessionable, and this filled the bill nicely. Dispensed to a dimpled mug with a hazed, light gold/straw color, a modest amount of frothy white head foam that reduced rather quickly to a ring & film, but left some clingy wisps of lacing on the glass. The nose was lightly lagerish, as yeast, Pils malt, and a slight carbonate scent. The flavor continued with low hop bitterness, a light, lemony tartness, and  good carbonation that helped project a pleasant dryness to this light bodied, quaffable brew.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

3304,"2011-11-09",3.3,"A new keg tapped at Bavarian Lodge, come-n-get-it. Appearance is quite as youd expect, a cloudy yellow pils color, a comforting sudsy beer head. Smell has the lightness of pilsener malt, and that soapy smell that sometimes comes with a really light beer. I guess its partly a consequence of some light beers. Taste is quite all right, though. Light, toasty lager malt with a nose of sweetness, and slightly mineral character from the yeast still present. A bit of crunchy noble hop once the beer flushes the chockies I just had off my palate. Settles into a fine Dortmunder, like DAB or Dog Days, hard water and all.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3304,"2011-05-23",3.8,"Draft at Craft Day Afternoon, multiple pours. This was a very solid beer. Not Paracelsus, but still not bad. Has a firm bitterness and meatiness from the yeast that kind of caught me a bit off guard then grew on me. Im not a huge fan of the strain they use at Metro, but it works pretty well in this one. Poured a hazy gold with a sticky white head. Nose is bready and fresh, quite bright and clean for a zwickel. Excellent bitterness and sweet malt profile. I enjoyed this one a ton.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3304,"2011-05-23",3.5,"Draft pour at Craft Day Afternoon (Chicago, IL). Pours a bright hazy yellow pour, a frothy bright white head is big, dies to a thick film that laces well. Aromas are cereal grains, touches of bread, dough, and touches of yeast. Some fruity apple is gentle, faint lemon, light florals. Initial is fizzy and lighter bodied preaching bread dough, pale malts, touches of lemon and apple fruit. Light gentle floral finish with lingering dough and bready malts. Fresh lively carbonation and bready malts with some crackers and just a hint of toast. Not a bad beer. Fresh, lively, and ""crushable"".","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
