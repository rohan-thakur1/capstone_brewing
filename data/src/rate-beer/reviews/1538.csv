1538,"2015-12-08",3.9,"22 oz bottle courtesy of a trade on BA. I guess were gonna keep opening these. Pours a decent hazed golden hue, lively bubbles, harvest golden and subtle orange glow. A lighter color overall than the previous. Frothy whitish head atop is bright, sizable with solid lacing and retention. Creamy frothy layer stays nice enough. Aromas are bright grapefruit rind and juiciness, lively pithy and oil elements, fresh and vibrant with gentle citric appeal. Earth, wheaty malts and bread creep behind that delicious juicy grapefruit juice appeal. Gentle florals, earth, lemon and faint guava. Lovely fresh stuff, juicy and appealing. Initial is lighter bodied, a decent to middling bitterness strikes the palate with grapefruit juice and rind appeal. Bitter and juicy, tart and fruity. This thing delivers some nice flavors, a bit tamer than the nose, but pleasant. Gentle wheaty malts, bread, and subtle straw. A crisper, cleaner malt appeal like the base beer. Grapefruit rind and juice, mellow body and decent bitterness make this quite the drinker into the backend and finish. Some gentle spiciness, pithy fruit and bitter rind. Lingering grapefruit is fresh, fruity and pleasant. Fun stuff. Fortunate Islands ends up a pretty solid hoppy wheat in its own right, but the grapefruit addition here really makes this fun. Not big, sweet or sticky, but still true to its base. A very potent and enjoyable nose for me (as a Grapefruit lover) with a solid pour, good flavors and cleaner decently bitter body that ends up pretty dang drinkable. Really nice stuff, an improvement over the base. Extra point overall because this is just crushable for days. Cheers, guys.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

>> Chill haze orange pour with diminishing white foam with scant lace. Nose is candied grapefruit slice, fresh red grapefruit juice, really pops nicely, mild butterscotch cake. Taste is mildly soapy, weaker bodied, scant grapefruit, more drinkable than Grapefruit Sculpin but lacking the sharp bitter zing that makes the grapefruit IPA thing really work.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

1538,"2014-11-07",3.5,"2014-10-24. Orange body with a small frothy off-white head. Aroma is hoppy, notes of grass and muted citrus, light floral notes. Average bodied palate, soft near flat carbonation. Flavour is moderately bitter, with notes of grass, mild citrus and resin. Okay, expected more of a citrus punch from something with grapefruit in the name/description. On cask at Cask Days, Toronto.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
1538,"2014-10-25",3.3,"Cask Days 2014. Pours a light orange/yellow. Aroma is bright with grapefruit, and tropical fruits. Taste is bready with mild grapefruit at the end. Medium body. Cask carb. Smooth in the mouth. Overall ok. Needs more cowbell.","Barrie, Ontario, CANADA","sudomorph"
1538,"2014-04-05",4.2,"On cask at the brewery. Pours a hazy light orange with small white head. Grapefruit in spades in the nose. Nothing else really gets through which is nice but the regular aroma is great with mango. Taste is again dominated by grapefruit but the base is still there with a great amount of mango still there with some lemon and slight sweetness and peppery hops. Nice deviation on one of my favorite new beers.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
