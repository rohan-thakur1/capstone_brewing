3219,"2017-06-04",3.1,"Bottle:
Hazy golden-yellow with a moderate. off-white head.
Grain, corn, maybe a little pear note in the aroma.
Taste is sweet, a bit of corn malt, barley malt....some fruitiness.
Very decent body and a pleasant taste....
Soft, and a bit doughy, but not bad at all.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"

3219,"2017-05-13",3.0,"Rated on 5-13-2017. Bottle labeled Best By 11OCT17. The appearance is a medium sized fizzy white head that mostly diminished, transparent golden body, fast rising carbonation, and one ring of lacing. The aroma is lightly citrus, sweet, grassy, yeast, and malt. The flavor presents yeasty, malt and sweet. The mouthfeel is smooth, thin and clean. This beer is light bodied. This beer has more aroma than flavor. Very lacking in taste. It is very light and watery. It is easily forgettable for me.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

3219,"2017-05-11",3.1,"Aroma is malts and mlld notes of corn and fruit. The flavor is malts/corn, mild fruit/berries and a sweet/slightly grainy finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
3219,"2017-05-06",3.4,"Bottle from Three Cellars in the Falls. Copper orange pour. Off white head. Lager-y, yeasty, some fruit, sweet malts. Didnt really get any corn to the positive. Malt is slightly doughy, but overall quite clean. Finishes sweetly. For style, better than most. 12.7","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
3219,"2017-04-25",3.5,"Clear straw amber color with a thin head. Aroma is clean, crisp grain and doughy malt. Crisp flowery grain and hops flavor up front with a clean malty background and a quick crisp finish. A good easy drinking session beer.","Wisconsin, USA","twindadplus2"
3219,"2017-04-17",2.8,"12oz bottle pours a clear pale golden/copper with a large white head. Aroma of grassy and lightly citrus hops, lager yeast, and light caramel toffee malt. Taste of corn and faded caramel malt, lager yeast, and faint generic over boiled hops. Only slightly better than similar Mexican Lagers.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
3219,"2017-03-22",3.1,"Golden color with a moderate, off-white head. Very light aroma, reminiscent of beaten egg whites. Really only a hint of malt/grain and a sweet flower. Light sweet start. Actually some decent malt flavors. A hint of grain/corn in the linger. Zippy feel, fairly appropriate, although it is a bit thicker and slightly coating in the finish. Crisp, Clean, and refreshing. Overall a nice lager.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3219,"2017-03-16",4.1,"Growler from the brewery. They really nailed it with this one. Not unlike Modelo Especial, but with better ingredients and way fresher. Fresh, light, clean. Bready malt tones, but uber-clean and lovely. Pretty much an awesome lager. Some decent malt depth. Probably my favorite session beer as of this moment. Awesome.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
