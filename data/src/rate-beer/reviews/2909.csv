2909,"2017-03-24",3.3,"Cork exploded, bright pale gold. Big brett aroma, lightly horsey with sterile gauze. A bit flat and seltzery feel. Tart apple, funky dry brett finish. Overall pretty good.","RIP Johnnies, Chicago, Illinois, USA","emerge077"
2909,"2016-12-31",3.5,"Attractive, bright yellow. Aroma is strong hay, strong barnyard, strong cow. Obviously apple, too, but this is about the farm. Taste is somewhat dry, but there is apple sweetness. Comes down to how much barn you want in your cider.","Alberta, CANADA","thb"
2909,"2016-12-31",3.9,"Pours a clear golden with nice bubbles. Nose is really ""farmhouse"" with some distinct cow poop aromas. Some leather as well. Taste must be dry but I can still feel a little sweetness with flavors of apple skin, apple juice and not too tart. Body is light, carbonation high and mouthfeel is quite tannic. A fun farmhouse cider that is just a bit less impressive than the Dupont and other Britanny ciders Ive had so far. Maybe with a little more tartness?","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

2909,"2016-12-20",4.0,"Bottle shared. Clear gold pour with foamy white head. Aroma is super funky, fecal, shitty aroma. Taste is quite tart, shitty, really nice farmyard notes. Palate is light bodied, sweet, light carbonation.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2909,"2016-12-20",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2016 Bottle (750 ml), shared. Thanks to kbudd19 for this bottle! Clear bright golden with a medium white head leaving little lacing. Aroma is quite farmy - manure and cheesy - with cider apples, fruity brettanomyces and dust. Taste is also super farmy with cheesy notes, cider apples, light fruity brett, dust and mild spiciness. Medium body. Moderate but ample carbonation. Farmy and fruity finish. Super farmy but really good cider. Tasty and easy drinking.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2909,"2016-11-14",4.0,"Pommes et terre, fromage coulant et levures indigènes: rien de plus plaisant avec une rôtie et des cretons. Beau liquide doré bien effervescent. Petite couche de douceur sur la langue tandis que les notes fermières et les pommes tombées sur le sol depuis quelques jours flattent mes papilles. Des notes vraiment sèches pour conclure cette dégustation vraiment chouette. Inutile donc de dire ici que ce truc de Normandie est excessivement facile à boire.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2909,"2016-08-12",3.9,"Aroma is so cheesy and funky but a nice ripe apple underneath. Very dry and funky,great!","Saskatchewan, CANADA","dresden"

2909,"2016-08-12",4.0,"Bottle - Lots of horse blanket. Clear gold with a frothy white head. Nice farmhouse, effervescent and a nice bit of acidity. Great.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2909,"2015-01-23",3.4,"Golden in colour very slight head, hardly any fizz in the glass. Hardly any nose. Slightly fizzy in the mouth a little toffee and a little drying on the mouth at the end.","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","apickles"
2909,"2014-09-27",4.0,"75 cl bottle to tulip (shared with the Mrs; thanks DuffMan!). Looks good; a hazy apricot with white head and lively carbonation. Smells of cider apples, champagne yeast, and a bit of dust and smoke. A bit of horse blanket as well. Tastes like it smells, but the apple presence is stronger (great apples!), with a nice, dry mouthfeel. The other flavors reemerge as the cider warms and opens up. DuffMan did an excellent job describing this beer; this cider is stunning!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2909,"2014-09-26",3.2,"Bottle from a French supermarket. Deep golden and relatively still. The taste is medium sweet apples with a little vanilla and sherbet. A very dry finish.","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","gegwilson"
2909,"2014-05-06",4.3,"Pours a clear pale yellow gold with an effervescent head foaming up big before settling back to a persistent half finger. Nose is sharp apple vinegar, horse blanket and dusty basement, faint cheese. Taste is tartly pleasant and follows the nose, not too sweet, with a crisp, dry finish. Mouth feel is light and pleasant, buoyed by rolling champagne carbonation.

This is a lot of fun, with a lot of the best characteristics of a champagne and a lambic. Definitely worth trying!","CANADA","UXO"
2909,"2012-04-01",4.4,"Bottle, shared with mmmIPA. Hazy pale yellow gold, fine carbonation, effervescent head that lasts only seconds. Aroma is absolutely awesome: vinegar, horseblanket, cobwebs/dusty basement, cheese, and apples. Flavours are equally amazing, like an apple tart baked in a leather pan, stored in your basement under a horseblanket, and served with soft rindy cheese. Lightly spicy, and with a vinegar tang in the finish. There is something else here too, almost like an arrowroot cookie flavour with those fresh apples. I could drink and drink and drink.... Incidentally, this is the second Normandie-style cider Ive had, a style that  almost should be in a class all its own.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
2909,"2012-01-26",4.2,"RBAG 2012. Thanks to pintbypint for bringing this wonderful organic cider. Pours a bright yellow with a quickly settling white lace. Huge aromas of fresh tart apples, wild yeast, grass, barnyard funk, leather, sweet apple pie with a hint of cinnamon (think thats what VBS was looking for). Nice dry, tarty finish, which is very, very refreshing. Very Lambic in its drinking qualities and a sign of good fruit in this cider. Wanted this 750ml bottle to myself but I HAD to share!!","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Torontoblue"
2909,"2012-01-25",4.0,"RBAG 2012. Thanks pintbypint. This was an amazing cider with some really impressive sour notes. Lots of tart fresh apples. A very fresh aroma and taste that I found very refreshing. The sweetness was not overpowering and appropriately offset by the tart qualities. Yeast is noticeable and enjoyable. Really great cider.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"
2909,"2012-01-25",4.1,"RBAG - This is an awesome cider. Lets just get that out there right away. Pours clear pale yellow, thin white head, no lacing. Nose is earthy apples, with some light funk and leather. Yeast notes on this are almost lambic-like, just a stunning aroma. Flavours of leather, cider apples, blue cheese, goat cheese, and again just a fantastic yeast note. Gorgeous stuff!","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
2909,"2012-01-21",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2012 RBAG 2012... yes, Im still drinking. mmmm. the aroma almost reminds me of a lambic at some points here... this stuff is amazing, fresh apples, skinless apples, light yeast.. Im trying to figure out how to describe how good the apple here is and why it just so damn impressive. The taste is equally amazing with wonderful fresh apple taste, little sweetness without being a big dry cider, a bit of yeast. Great simple impressive flavour.
