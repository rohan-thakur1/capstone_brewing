3053,"2016-03-20",2.8,"Winterfest 2016. Aged for 12 months they say. The alcohol is the most prominent flavor and aroma of this beer. Overwhelming spirit and oak flavors, dry oak, some vanilla, a little caramel. Very little carbonation at all. Dark brown color, it looks good. Still, given the prominent flavors of alcohol and the oak dryness, I sadly find it nearly undrinkable. I am sure it would have been much better without the barrel treatment. Nonetheless, I can recognize this is a well made beer.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

3053,"2015-02-10",3.8,"Bottle from last years release, about a year old. Hearty, oily black with negligible head retention. The aroma recalls a middle-aged Expedition stout, with emphasis on peaberry coffees, prunes, and charred cocoa. Its almost overwhelmingly sweet, with cookie dough, molasses and cola syrup persistently pushing cloying boundaries. As it airs out, the underlying depth becomes more expansive, and this becomes the lasting takeaway.

The flavor is a curious rendering of expected and unexpected flavors. It is initially weirdly powdery and bitter, like burnt peanuts mixed with cigarette ash. Like the aroma, it opens up slowly to reveal warmer, more polished colorings of roasted blackberries, auburn honey, and dutch chocolate. Sugars throughout are shielded in a succulent haze of sweet tobacco smoke. At this point, the powerful, peppery rye barrel and formidable malt characteristics well-synced, and no component part is too controlling. 

Velvety, decadent mouthfeel. Mid palate sweet and alcoholic, finishing with a refined, sherry-like singe. I definitely enjoy the malt construction and low bitterness accumulation in this, although the heavier dark malts seem to cloud the view of things here. This could just as easily be thought of as an imperial stout with low hop character. Enjoyably unusual overall.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3053,"2015-02-02",3.8,"Bottle... Pours hazy and dark brown with a small, fleeting, well-tanned head.

Aroma is pretty damn good. Loaded with deep caramels and dark chocolates, but a really nice woody rye aspect behind the malts. A good amount of roasts, a light vanilla, some whiskey, toasted coconut, and a few dark fruits. Flavor is just as enjoyable. A light rye spiciness and wood up front with a big dark chocolate and caramel maltiness. Very rich and not cloying in the least bit. Some whiskey in the middle with a soft vanilla note, some dark fruits, and a bit of a toasted coconut. A good amount of roasts towards the end as the wood and whiskey increase a bit before this finishes rich and malty, but pretty dry and moderately bitter from a rye spiced, earthy, roasty bitterness. Warming, lengthy aftertaste following a medium-full, smooth body that never gets too chewy or boozy with a soft, light carbonation. Overall, a pretty impressive barleywine.

3053,"2012-07-27",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2012 As Minnesotas number 1 Templeton Rye drinker.... (yes I import one bottle on average every two months....) so I have two ratings for you. First is not compared to the whiskey, second is.

First: Aromatics are HOT, with a little back bone of roast malt (barely...), chocolate, and burnt coffee. Pours jet black with little to no lacing but lacing is caramel in color. first taste is straight malt and roasted coffee with chocolate, followed by heat, finished by more chocolate. Palate is nice and mouthy fills without overwhelming. Overall a solid 3.7.....

Second (paired with actual Templeton): Aromatics of the Templeton do not overwhelm the palate due to heat (like the beer does, where did the heat come from?), it is a subtle secondary, first being caramel followed by light rye. The beer imparts a deep dark roast. Appearance of both are vastly different. Beer looks awesome and whiskey looks awesome, respectful due to what they are. Taste of the whiskey followed by the beer (in true pairing style) is non-complementary.... (I thought they would piggyback each other) the beer kills any whiskey flavor or taste. Palate, each is great at the style. Overall, I do NOT think this beer captures any essence of Templeton Rye. I DO think its a great beer, just dont claim the awesomeness of Templeton if you cant back it up (Rye Wyne Ale did a FAN-Fin-TASTIC job though).... Sorry, I would rate this beer much higher than a 3.7 if you didnt claim the Templeton Rye part.

I hope Templeton is more select in the choosing of where they sell their barrels next time....

6-Month review - After a solid 6-month cooling off phase for the beer and myself i have an update! A lot of the above stands but the heat cooled down dramatically! Not as good as a fresh BCBS but still a great brew. I still taste no Templeton (must be the heavy roast malt covering it up). Overall I boosted this beer .3!","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","burgy"
