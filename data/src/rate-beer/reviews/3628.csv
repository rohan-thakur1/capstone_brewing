3628,"2017-03-26",3.5,"Cask handpull at The County Hotel Ashford JDW. Redcurrant sharp pink grapefruit flavour. Decent condition. The red currant jelly flavour is attractive and assertive. I can see people calling this harsh. But i dont think so. Its got some sweet pale malt then a sharpish jam spread over it. Sour more than bitter finish.

3628,"2017-03-24",3.5,"Cask handpull at Hamilton Hall as Oakham Enough Rope. Pale amber orange, still and pretty much clear with a compact foamy beige head. Aroma is gooseberry and soft biscuity malt. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is drying straw, pale wood, sawdust, some astringent herbs, the malt character is fairly light and plays second fiddle to the bitter hops. Tasty stuff, if maybe just a touch off balance. Woody, dry and bitter. Flavour also has me thinking of old rope - just because of the name. A half was nice but enough.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

3628,"2016-06-11",3.4,"Handpull cask at the Smithfield, Derby. Dark gold, clear, a tiny bit of white head but fairly flat. Fresh mango and orange peel in the aroma. Bitter hoppy taste, with the fruitiness of Simcoe seeming to run the show. Bitter and slightly astringent long finish. The pint Ive had may not be quite at its best but its obviously a good beer.
