3857,"2016-11-18",4.3,"Tall boy can of two and a half months old - so I urgently needed to open it - obtained through a trade with tderoeck, thanks Tim (and thanks Ster for keeping it aside for me). One of the countless Trillium IPAs that make this brewery to what it is: the epitome of the new generation of cloudy, tropically fruity, aromatic, soft New England IPA style, along with a few other breweries in the same larger area. Dry-hopped twice, using familiar names as Citra and Columbus but also the lesser known and much more recent (2010) El Dorado. Thin, off-white, loose head quickly reduced to a tiny rim around the glass and some dots in the middle but eventually all but vanishing, over an immediately cloudy, warm peach blonde beer with ochre-ish hue. Rich, dank and lush aroma of yellow grapefruit flesh, sweet onion juice, toasted shallot, passion fruit, overripe mango, herb cheese, green banana, pine resin, light biscuit, guava, yellow curry, curcuma, lime juice, soap (the wheat, I guess), very lightly toasted white bread, zucchini, green chilli pepper, mandarin - a complex and refined combo that makes my mouth water in instants. Vividly fruity onset, a wave of tropical fruit juice with sweet and sourish components beautifully mixed to perfection, impressions of passion fruit, kumquat, lime, papaja and guava, medium carbonation (just the right amount for a modern IPA, to my taste), soft and supple, almost fluffy and slightly soapy (wheat!) mouthfeel, pleasant minerally accents here and there. A soft biscuity and lightly caramelly malt body builds in the middle, with this mixture of lush tropical fruit and minerals connecting seamlessly to a very aromatically hoppy finish, bursting with retronasal grapefruit, pine, mango, lychee and exotic pepper aromas, all with a beautiful sweet citrus (orange) lacing, and providing the soft but effective, spicy (at some point even softly raw green chilli-like), grapefruity yet elegant bitterness to dry the back of the mouth cavity without attacking it, leaving a resinous coating. Juiciness - both malty and fruity - passes through wave after wave while the resinous hop bitterness ties it all together. Alcohol goes by completely unnoticed. Another Trillium masterpiece: these guys really are the ultimate specialists in this East Coast IPA trend, delivering one beautiful example after another. This particular example goes a bit beyond the more familiar sweet tropical fruit profile of many of its congeners by adding a slightly more piney and onion-like character, which gives it that little bit of oomph and - to my personal taste - positions it a notch above many others in this particular style, however delicious those others often are. Glad I tried it - and glad I thought about opening it just in time, as this type of beers are obviously very delicate and lose much of their fragrance at an early stage. An unmistakable masterpiece in the vast - global - world of 21st-century IPA, just too bad for the lack of head...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

This DDH version is sticky, cloudy, and resiny from how much hop oil is floating around, and that is a very good thing. Theres a lot of great, clean hop flavor, although the extra El Dorado hops did kind of make it a little cloying. Overall, this is one in a long line of try exceptional Trillium beers. Definitely seek it out if you can!","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3857,"2016-02-08",4.0,"Really nice hazy pale pour with white head. Aroma is intense grapefruit, lime, mango, and earthy. Taste is sharply bitter and somewhat resiny. I dont care for how earthy el dorado hops are but otherwise cool beer.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3857,"2016-02-07",4.1,"Bottle purchased at the brewery. Bottle date of 19 January 2016. Aroma is off the chain. Loaded with tons of fruit, pineapple, mango, passion fruit and just a note of pine. Damn, I smell this as it is poured. How many pounds of hops did they use?? 
The flavor has just a touch of yeast to go with this hop profile. Fresh juicy fruits with a mild touch of pine hops with a nice mild malt balance. Not overly sweet and not so bitter it kills your taste buds. The mouthfeel has a nice soft / airy/ delicate aspect found in some other New England IPAs. Balance is really great. There is a reason there is a buzz at this brewery. 
I am making more of a effort to visit this place more often.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3857,"2016-02-06",4.2,"750ml bottle pours a hazy dirty yellow color with a bit of frothy head. Some pineapple flavor and lots of hop bitterness. Not much other tropical fruit notes.","California, USA","Bule"
3857,"2016-02-06",4.2,"En fût, Row 34. Robe voilée et jaune. Mousse collante. Superbe nez dananas avec divers agrumes, de la terre, des herbes, du sorbet à la mangue. Goût fruité, acidulé, jlherbacé, floral, complexe, très fort. En bouche, corps parfait ou presque, bonnes bulles, corps juteux. Finale franche, amère, pleine de mangues piquantes. Délicieuse.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
3857,"2016-02-05",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2017 Growler filled 1/29/16 and drunk 1/30/16.Massively sweet, juicy, tropical, lush aromatics burst forth upon opening the growler. Wow. Can smell this stuff from a couple feet away. Intensifies as its being poured, with a heavily hazy orange-golden body and a large white head that fades slowly to cover.Pineapple, guava, mango, lime, lemon, grapefruit. Pretty much all manner of citrus and tropical fruit is covered here. No alcohol and only sparse honey and biscuit-like malts behind it.Flavor is a bit more of a mixed-bag for me. It starts out delightfully tropical, bursting with citrus and light honey, as well. Juicy and lush, it slowly picks up that heavy tanginess that I associate with El Dorado. It turns rather sharp and perfumey on the finish and is really the only thing holding this thing back from being an absolute showstopper. The malts are well-attenuated, with a soft, creamy-to-oily texture and tight carbonation. Probably had they used a different hop, Id appreciate it more, but as is, I just dont care much for El Dorados punchy/tangy/sharpness. 9/4/7/4/14

Canned 2/7/17, drunk 2/20/17.
This was damned-near perfect for a NE IPA and one of the best Trilliums Ive had in a long while. Juicy, crisp and perfectly bitter (not very) with none of the ester, sweat, twang or booze that sometimes plagues their beers. Soft and inviting mouthfeel with perfect carbonation and delicate honey and cracker notes. Juicy lime, mango and pineapple with hints of cherry, spicy, green, dank and complex hop notes. Wow! Overall score is for this version.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3857,"2016-02-04",4.0,"Bottle. Pours cloudy golden orange, medium creamy off-white head, dissipates fairly quickly but laces really well. Aroma is pine and pineapple, perfume and dank wet leaves. Flavor is light sweet, light plus bitter, juicy and resinous. Medium body, soft creamy mouthfeel. Not the most amazing hop combination, but solid in every way.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3857,"2016-02-04",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2016 Lots of very fresh hops. Almost tastes unripe. Aroma of sharp tangerine and some green onion. Pours hazy orange with good head and lacing. Bitter finish. Some peel and pine. Very nice. Bottle drank in my hotel room in Harar.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
3857,"2016-02-03",4.0,"Very excited over this one. Bottled 1-19-16 and consumed 2-2-16 so exactly two weeks old. Pours (well, we all seen dem Instagram pics of these NE ipas) looks like juice. Like oranges, peaches, and bananas put onto a juice extractor and this is what you get. Along with a thin white head. Smell is fruity, really fruity, gotta love that ddh. Theres peaches, pineapples, mangos, some spice and herbs, some cilantro? wheat and some oj. For the most part its fruity. The taste is really complex. It starts fruity and tropical, but quickly gets piney with plenty of bitterness to follow suit. Followed by the spices and herbs, with a dry finish. Has plenty of carbonation, in the high side for an ipa, rather light, but its able to keep its creaminess. Overall pretty good, and very complex. I got alot of flavors from this ipa. Its still piney and bitter though. I didnt see this as whole different pedigree (not this one for the moment. Nonetheless its solid. Would bang again if I can get my hands on it again.","South Gate, California, USA","toxichop"
3857,"2016-02-03",4.0,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip: Pours hazy straw / orange with a nice white head and good retention. Aroma of citrus, tropical fruit, pineapple, and cracker malts. Taste is very citrus forward, a little bready, nice bitter finish. Really nice IPA.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
3857,"2016-02-02",4.2,"Un grand merci à Yannick pour cette bouteille! Cheers mon vieux! Le liquide a un forte densité laiteuse et crémeuse dans mon verre. On dirait vraiment quune touche lactée fut ajoutée au liquide pour lui donner une allure aussi soyeuse et douce, tandis quune mousse uniforme et alléchante se forme au dessus du liquide. Un nez à la Trillium! Le Citra est parfaitement balancé et offre un profil aromatique très houblonné, sans verser dans le pipi de chat ou dans lécorce dagrume trop puissante. Des notes terreuses et humides se joignent au bouquet fruité et ajoutent ainsi une couche supplémentaire de complexité. En bouche, les arômes sexpriment librement dans la même veine. Le fruit est frais et riche, le liquide juteux tout en étant bien malté mais jamais lourd ni sucré. Une harmonie parfaite des saveurs et des textures. Encore une bière absolument délicieuse de cette brasserie qui collectionne les succès!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3857,"2016-02-01",3.9,"750ml bottle in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma strong of fruity and citrusy hops, some pale malts, and light dough. Flavor the same with a great hoppiness and light malts to balance them out. Average texture. A very solid beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
3857,"2016-01-28",4.2,"On tap at Armsby Abbey. I believe this batch was brewed at Trilliums second location in Canton (no, not the Chinese Canton). Hazy, unfiltered pale orange colored brew with a juicy citrus aroma, which is echoed in the fruity flavor. This is a well-crafted and balanced brew. A little bit of pine and lime adding a lot of complexity and making this quite an interesting ale. Have yet to see this breweries products penetrating as far as Western Mass, but with product this good and a recent expansion, theres hope.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"
3857,"2016-01-27",3.3,"Opaque, cloudy tan pour, small white head. Aroma is sweet of cream, caramel and citrus. Flavor is sweet of grass and citrus.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","williamstome"
3857,"2016-01-21",4.2,"Pours Trillium hazy into a tulip. Bright white head with little retention recedes to hug rim. Yeast, pineapple and passion fruit aromas. Medium bodied with sweet yeast and caramel upfront turning to tropical fruit before the lasting dry pith finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
