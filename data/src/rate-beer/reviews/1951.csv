1951,"2017-02-20",3.7,"Appearance: Molasses brown body that looks quite black once in the glass. Decent 2 finger head with minimal lacing and fades gradually. A tiny bit weak IMO.

Smell: Nice clean aroma of coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and some hops. A touch of sweetness rounds things out.

Taste: A good roasted feel. Good, solid coffee presence with a slight hint of fruit (dried?) maybe cherries or strawberries. A nice and mild sweet taste. A touch of bitterness at first then as it warms, its all malt. Really good.

Mouthfeel: Smooth but i found the carbonation a little high. It calms down though as it warms. Coats the mouth with ease. Medium body not more.","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"

Aroma has a moderate chocolate and roast character. Some low caramel and toffee notes. Moderate dark fruit esters with plum, cherry and floral notes. Light hop notes. 
Pours black, but with dark brown hues and a medium sized, fairly thick, light mocha head with decent retention as it slowly recedes. Light lacing and medium small legs. 
Flavor has a medium sweetness with balanced chocolate and roast. Some dark fruit notes of plum, cherry and raisin with some caramel and toffee. Medium bitterness with a medium light woody, herbal hop note. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.

1951,"2015-11-01",3.3,"Fizzy black pour, with an airy buildup of mocha hued bubbles. Tangy fruit aroma of raspberry, black cherry, black mission fig. Lactic tartness mingles with chocolate and baked graham crust sweetness, underneath. The ample, if guarded, malt depth becomes apparent with some warming, and these graham notes become the focal point. Lightly spiced flavor offers a melange of cinnamon, clove, and anise detailing the subtle dark malt, and these notes affect a cold, herbal sensation through the nose as well. No acrid malt, or soapiness, but its watery, and theres not enough density to the malt ultimately. The palate is nearly ruined by a violent over carbonation issue, and while a little air and a lot of time make it softer, it can never be described as texturally pleasing.  Brief, distantly fruity finish, astringent coffee grounds far out.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Thanks Steve!

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy, tan head that dissipated rather quickly. Poor lacing on the sides. Minimal retention. (Sight - 3.25)

First smell was some kind of liquor. First thought was bourbon, but that might have been more of a wish. Probably Baileys Irish Cream. Also purple grape, dark fruit, plum, raisins, pure dark chocolate, some roasted coffee beans, roasted toffee and dark caramel. Very nice on the nose. (Smell - 4.38)

Taste was just as good. Got dark fruit, plum, purple grape, fig, raisins, dark chocolate, sugary chocolate syrup and toffee. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Oily-to-creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.38)

I couldnt believe how good this was, especially for the style. Very tasty. (Overall - 4.25)

1951,"2014-04-24",1.7,"I was really surprised to sign on RateBeer and see how highly rated this beer was. It struck me as bland and sweet. Flavor is sweet, with little bitterness or sourness, mouthfeel is flat and thick, syrupy. Not much carbonation. I suppose if people rate this beer on smoothness alone, I could see its appeal. But I found it uninteresting. The aroma was featureless. Theres little roast or hops evident in the aroma, only a fairly plain malt. This was an unremarkable beer that I drank quickly and could forget. About the only thing I think it has going for it is that the medium-high alcohol content is well-masked, but I think its masked more by the sugar than anything else. I thought this beer way too sweet. Im not a huge fan of this style of beer, but I thought this a particularly poor example of it as well, and Im completely perplexed as to how this beer is so highly rated and has won so many awards.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

This has been sitting around long enough so I cracked it open one night. It is a great stout that I should have drunk a bit sooner. While still fresh this is so good that I would have consumed it immediately. Dont make the same mistake yourself.

Aroma / Appearance - The oily black base slides easily down the sides of the glass. A thin mocha head lasts for quite a while. Chocolate, raspberries, coffee, and smoke meld with ease into a chewy texture. Solid and robust it fills the air with goodness.

Flavor / Palate - Plums, coffee, and dark fruit stick to the throat. Almost as sweet as a lightweight imperial stout the texture is filling from start to finish. It avoids being sticky and saccharine. Enjoy it as long as possible before you move on to your next tick.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3.5 A: Black color. A little over a finger of frothy/fizzy hybrid head. Retention could be better and no lacing is left.

4.5 S: For a dry stout, this is simply dripping with maltiness. Tons of caramel, a soft roastiness, molasses and toffee, and some chocolate.

4.0 T: Tastes a lot like the nose with perhaps a touch more roast. Caramel, molasses, toffee, and chocolate. Pretty intense for the ABV.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could be a bit creamier, but not bad overall.

4.0 D: Good brew. They should brew this beer like they brewed the one Im drinking.

Slightly acrid roasted malt aroma with hints f oatmeal, chocolate, burnt toast and smoke.

Medium bodied with roster bitter chocolate malt flavor as well as some licorice, coffee, oatmeal, toffee and hazelnut. Slightly sweet but a bit too bitter with a dry finish.

A: Pours black with a fairly-substantial brown head that eventually recedes into some decent lacing.

S: Lots of roasted coffee, malt, and chocolate. A few dark fruits make their way in alongside some faint hop presence, but the coffee/chocolate balance is what really makes this one shine.

T: Coffee and chocolate dominate again. The roasted characteristics of each blend together very well, creating the best-tasting American Stout that I have had the chance of having.

M: Quite creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation.

D: Very high. Fairly-low alcohol to complexity ratio, so this is definitely one I could sip all day.

1951,"2010-11-20",4.3,"THOUGHTS: Nice, but not quite as good as I would have thought from all the high ratings. A little one sided, but it was a nice side. I was surprised at a dry stout having this high of an ABV, but it was definitely a dry as opposed to a sweet stout. It had a nice, balanced flavor.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown with red highlights, but appeared nearly, opaque black at wider points in the glass. It also had an average to large, creamy, tan, head that mostly diminished, but kept a nice blanket and left fair lacing. The aroma had heavy roasted malt and bitter coffee; lighter burnt malt; hints of dark chocolate; light earthy hops; slight chocolate, but mostly it was coffee. THe initial flavor was light to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, slightly sour and lightly bitter; while the finish was sweet and bitter; There was coffee, hints of chocolate, then cold hot cocoa, then sweet coffee, followed by bitter coffee, a little sour coffee, too, near the bottom of the bottle.

THe beer has a nice aroma of hops, malt, pine and prune.  This beer has a bit of a coffee flavor with chocolate and is somewhat creamy.

1951,"2010-08-27",3.1,"A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a two-finger thick, lightly browned, dark tan colored head.  The beer is a deep, concentrated brown color that approaches black.  When held up directly to the light it shows flashes of a brilliantly clear, ruby hue.  The aroma smells of richly roasted, slight acidic grain, burnt / toasted grain husks, a berry like fruitiness that is quite apparent if you dig around a bit, roasted toast and perhaps a touch of smokiness.  Somehow the nose makes this beer seem quite light as the nose is quite a bit more washed out than I would expect from a stout.  The dominant roast character seems to be missing the malty richness that is needed to carry the dominant roast character.

Somewhat thicker feeling than the aroma would have suggested, this is actually fairly viscous and has a heft to it that is nice; to be honest though it only seems so because the nose made this seem so thin.  Sweet, dark malt richness adds flavors of chocolate that help to tame the roast character of the nose.  The finish is fairly dry with a bitter, roasted malt note, but there is also a soft bitter hop bit that is noticeable from the finish too end.   Flavors of roasted coffee, a touch of smoky burnt character and some acidic burnt grain notes round out the notes found here.

While the flavor is a lot better than the nose led me to be, I find that I am quite disappointed.  I was really expecting a lot from this beer and it just sort of fizzles out; it is nice and easy drinking, but isnt nearly as flavorful as I was hoping.

1951,"2010-04-22",4.4,"Got this in a trade with CrellMoset. Thanks for the opportunity to try this great beer!

A- Very dark red/brown body that pours with a nice creme brulee colored foamy cap. Head fades pretty quickly to a thick collar and traces of lacing are left all the way down the glass. When held up to the light glimmering red hues shine through.

S-Rich, dark chocolate malt, a faint toffee sweetness, and a touch of roasted malt. Smells robust.

T-Taste is much like the smell. Rich dark chocolate malt upfront with a hint of toffee sweetness and just a touch of toastiness. The finish is all dark chocolate flavor which fades slowly. What is left behind is just a touch of roastedness, chocolate, and toffee.

P-Medium carbonation, and a wonderful smooth and creamy, yet full mouthfeel.

O- I know that this description sounds just like any other stout but the balance here is immaculate. The chocolate is the main character but the toffee and the roasted flavors play wonderful supporting roles. Nothing is overpowering and it all goes down wonderful and smooth...If this were a car it would ride like a Cadillac.

Palate: Medium bodied. Elegant on the palate. Light notes of cold-processed chocolate, light roast black coffee, oats, and a splash of cream (without the creamy texture, though).

Notes: A really drinkable and balanced stout. I was surprised at how light it was on the palate given the color and the nose, but that only makes it more drinkable. Alcohol is in balance, too.

1951,"2008-08-22",4.1,"A side by side blind tasting of the 22oz bottles brewed at the original estate brewery vs. the 12oz version contract brewed at Gearys.

22oz:
Dark brown, with a creamy, dense head of beige that lasts throughout the glass wtih some decent lacework.

Aromatics filled with dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malts and plenty of caramel. A slight fruit note follows through and the nose finishes with a mildly sweet note.

The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Velvety and luscious.

Nougat, dark chocolate, mild espresso, and caramel lead off the pallet. Fudgy and a bit chewy. Mildly sweet with some dark fruit way underneath.

Finishes with lingering chocolate, roast, and nougat. 

Incredible smooth and drinkable. Somewhat rich and very balanced.

12oz:

Pours dark brown, identical in color to the bomber, but the head pours shorter and quickly dissapates. Barely a trace of lacework.

Aromatics are a blend of bitter chocolate, caramel, brownie bits, acrid malt and butterscotch. The nose is much drier, coarser, and slightly minerally, as well as hugely overun by the Ringwood yeast.

The mouthfeel is crisper, dryer, and slightly spritzy. Missing the smooth, velvet feel of the bomber.

Dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, caramel, and roast coffee lead off the pallet.
Quite dry and slightly acrid. Butterscotch steps forward and detracts from the drinkability.

Finishes with some coarsesness, quite dry and roasty.

The two versions side by side have many glaring differences. The smooth, slightly sweet, and rounded sophistication of the original version is gone, and in place is the buttery Ringwood yeast, coarser carbonation, and dryer character.
The rating I’m giving this one is on the original version, with hopes that the new version being brewed at the brewpub will be up to grade.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

Taste is excellent. Roasted malts, hints of bittersweet chocolate and a slight bit of fruitiness rounds out the flavor. It is very well balanced.

Recieved this bottle from scthaden, thank you. Cadillac Mountain Stout pours absolute black. When directly backlit deep mahogany highlights extend through the body. As I pour a one finger beige head forms and eventually falls to a generous crown. Leaves spotty lacing here and there.

The nose is a little faint on this one. The malts are on the border of being roasted and theres a generous helping of cocoa powder. A lactic creaminess comes around with each swirl of the glass. This bottle actually smells like it may still be a little green. 

The flavor is far superior to the aroma. The grains are roasted just to the point being slightly bitter. Coffee grounds add a touch of bitterness as well. The creaminess comes through mid-palate along with a mild dark fruitiness and the cocoa powder. I even seem to pick up a pinch of nuttiness on the finish. As this beer warms the complexities continue coming forward. An excellent tasting stout.

This is a medium bodied stout with a silky smooth mouthfeel. Glides through the mouth effortlessly. Finishes slightly dry letting some of the coffee ground and roasty bitterness shine through.

This is a stout you could sit down with and enjoy all night. A tasty stout I cant see myself tiring of.

Im glad I was finally able to try this beer. Ive been eyeing it up for awhile now and was finally able to set up a trade. A beer Id pick up often if locally available. Thanks for the opportunity Shannon.

The finish was pleasant and warming as the alcohol made itself known near the end, although this beer was a little too thin bodied to be considered a really good stout.

Biscuity malts and a milk chocolate/caramel duet comprise the majority of the nose, with lesser notes of cashews, roasty malts, anise and molasses. Alcohol is suitably concealed. The flavor is very satisfying, bringing additions of dried figs and raisins. Light sweetness and light acidity are muffled further by moderate roast and plenty of malt. The finish is semi-dry and somewhat short. Carbonation is very high, otherwise the light-medium to medium mouthfeel is great. Very fun to drink.

Well, I did, as I was curious if it was actually as good as people said, considering I wasnt crazy about it. Well, I was right, but I immediately saw the list of the best dry stouts -- the way Guinness was supposed to taste -- and there at the top was this lovely beer. 

So, low and behold, I finally have one in my hands. While its not the heavenly gift I was hoping for, its still a nice beer. Black, sooty nose, slight peanut-brittle and chalk.

Appearance was standard. Deep black, khaki head, beautiful beer. But as soon as it hit my mouth I could tell something was wrong. Overly thin, nearly watery in its consistency. Tasted like fake chocolate, something like Hersheys might throw together. Lightly hopped.

The pour also releases alot of CO2 which really smells plasticy.  Below the blanket of dioxide is a subdued roasted malt profile that is indeed invited.  Fortunately, the body really redeems the nose.  The slight tartness in the finish makes this beer for me.  Sure there is lots of bitter coffee and dark chocolate.  Some toffee and nuttiness as well.  But it isnt overly sweet and the tartness concretes this.  It is nice to drink a full flavored stout that isnt as filling as a chocolate dessert.

The nose on this beer is very impressive, with lots of big dark chocolate, coffee, and roasty aromas, paired with hop aromas of citrus and pine. The palate is rich and full, with lots of good flavors of dark chocolate, coffee, and roast. This beer finishes with more of those big flavors, then ends roasty and dry with some good  citrus hop bitterness as well. A fresh and flavoful stout, this beer is a great match to hearty fare, shell fish (when in Maine, lobsters of course) or rich and creamy deserts.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

1951,"2005-12-12",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2006 FIRST RATING (12-12-05): Very good stout. Thick-headed.   Does not have the burnt or bitter quality some micro-brew stouts have.  Rather sweet.  The flavor is a little overpowering at first, but after a few sips it is less so.  Not something Id have everyday, but a very good stout... I had it in a 22 oz. bottle, but I bet it is much better on tap.


RE-RATE:
Figured Id re-rate this for old-times sake and since Ive tried so many more beers since, and I know what Im doing a little better what Im doing now than I did a year ago (though some may argue otherwise).  Black opaque body withi initially thick, slow to dissipate tan head.  Smells sweet, chocolaty or coffee (I cant decide), with hints of hops and yeast.  Tastes initially sweet and roasty, but has a hoppy aftertaste.  A very good stout, but would be better if the hop bitterness werent quite so pronounced.  Still very good.  Glad I got it again, Im more impressed this time.  If I were smart, Id go to the coast and get it on tap...","Derry, New Hampshire, USA","BigBen2120"

1951,"2005-11-21",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2006 The Lure:Luxurious dark chocolate and malt roastiness combine over a profound molasses-like sweetness. Simple and authentic, evidently a lip smacker of a good pint. Carbonation levels might be a little too high, but that is still to be tested.

The Festivities:Roasted and chocolate malts form cookies on which Id love to chew all day. Raisins and fresh figs complexify the sweetness which precedes the diplomatic roasty bitterness. Carbonation is indeed a little too agressive early on, but once you start getting halfway through the pint its fine. A top notch stout, ideal for sessions as well as tastings.

1951,"2005-05-31",4.0,"2005 bomber from Downeast Beverage shared with Muzzlehatch on 5/22/2005 at the ""Crappy Maine beers plust two random Belgians and a Cider"" tasting.  Dark chocolate brown, light fuscia hints on the edges when held to the light.  Tons of sediment in the bottle, highly unfiltered.  Tan head is initially medium-sized but recedes rather quickly to cover then nothing.  Coating is left behind by the viscous liquid.  Aroma of sweet prunes covered in chocolate, fresh roasted barley and plenty of java notes.  Bit of vinousness, with more fat sweet malt sugars.  Flavor is a mix of moderate roastiness and sweet chocolate to start, and being quite flavorful if perhaps somewhat overhyped, the beer could really go either way from the first notes that hit the palate.  Fortunately, a substantial, thick, chewy malt providing a full body and unfiltered, chewy mouthfeel allow the flavors to seemlessly roll together in the mouth and some notes of soy and smoke, raisins and molasses all jump in to the mix.  Quite rich and drinkable it is, and even more so for a style which can, at times, be watery and very cookie-cutter-like.  Bit of thinning on the end, but it is minor.  Some vinousness and bits of oily roast linger, giving way to the bittersweet bakers chocolate seen throughout.  High score from me because it is relative to style.

The 22oz bottle was a 40 minute experiance for me, and I enjoyed every sip.  Very distinct flavors are present in this beer, incredible definition and taste.  This beer isnt particularly creamy, but extremely dry.  I actually prefer the Stout at Sebago Brewing in Southern Maine to this, but thats simply because I enjoy a sweet stout more than a dry.

Aroma: bits of coffee, and cocoa, very dry, offering up flavors, but never too boldly, with a carbonated, cola-ish feel, as well.
Taste: Nice, bristling hops at the fore, soon to fade, and settle back into a light, crisp, chocolatey cushion. Gets more coffee & cocoa, further in, never straying from the dry stout definition, but probably further defining in, saying, ""yeah, this is it, no more questions!""

1951,"2004-05-29",4.1,"wow, what a stout!  superb in every way, color, taste, smell, you name it this beer does it.  certainly the best of the maine brews i have sampled so far.  a nice sweet flavor (leading me to believe this is more of a sweet than a dry, but whatever).  hints of coffee that are masked completely on aftertaste.  i wasnt expecting this beer to be as good as it was.  certianly the best brew to come out of maine as far as im concerned.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
1951,"2004-05-10",3.9,"This is a top notch stout.  The pour is solid black with a tan thin layered head settling on top.  Roasted malt in the nose with a hint of chocolate.  The flavors are a fine combination of coffee, sweet malt, and chocolate.  A touch of hops gives a nice dry finish.  Medium bodied and not too heavy for a stout.  Ill need to get another one shipped to me real soon.","Seattle, Washington, USA","leitrim65"
1951,"2004-04-29",4.8,"Equipment: 22 oz bottle served chilled in a Trois Pistoles goblet. 

Appearance: Dark dark black with brown highlights that poured out a bit like some used motor oil. A light brown head formed and stuck around for a few sips before it decided to settle down to a small layer of thick and creamy foam.

Aroma: Rich roasted malts, prunes, and coffee aromas are quite prominent. Mild vanilla notes. Damn fine. Damn Damn fine.

Flavor: Chocolatey sweet roasted malts with vanilla aftertastes. In-farking-credible.

Palate: Earthy and robust, yet still silky smooth. Soothing.

Overall: Um... who do I have to kill to get some more of this? Must I bow down to BaHaaabah and sacrifice goats? I want a case of this, and I want it yesterday. Only bested by Oak Barrel Stout, IMHO, but it was a close match.

Other: Went great with some dark Belgian chocolate.","Anacostia, Washington DC, USA","SeamusNeko"
1951,"2004-04-18",4.1,"Pours a beautiful golden amber highlighted dark brown, sits in the glass like used motor oil, dark, heavy and blackish brown. Gorgeous crown of tan whipped foam grows up to about an inch and slowly fades down to a very heavy skimmed cap that never leaves, big inky globs of lace stick.

Charred nose of slight coffee and chocolate. Has a good roasty tone with some sweetish bread notes seeping up and a softer, supple fruitish banana-lime dullness, seemingly complex but overall a bit to soft. I kept waiting for this to wow me in the nose but nothing doin'. It changed slightly as it warmed to room temp with a bit more coffee-espresso hinted roast quality and some vanilla.

Taste has an oaty sweet front with some chocolate covered nuttyness and lightly present subdued/dulled fruits of yellow raisin and banana. Roasted, charred-like malts sweep in and slap the sweetness out about midway where a base of coffeeness takes over. Finishes with a good mix of leftover sweetened oats, coffee, and chocolate and bits of peanut skin-like drying and astringent roastability play over the top of everything. Intriguingly complexing and yielding with flavor.

Feel is favorably smooth and silky, nearly full and well rounded with a beckoning sweetness just begging to get past the roasty coffee which does take place very late in the finish. Wait for it cuz its altogether delicately decorous. A predominant drinker for sure, smooth and sweet with just the right amount of handable roast.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
1951,"2004-02-20",4.2,"Brew #1465: Deep dark opaque brown with a medium tan head. The aroma was roasty and chocolatey, with a nice tart fruitiness in the background. The flavor was a perfect mix of roasty coffee and bitter chocolate...scrumptious! Medium-thick feel...quite crisp on the tongue...dry finish. Great dry stout. Thanks herbjones.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
1951,"2004-02-20",4.0,"Opaque black color with a medium tan head. Very roasty aroma, with some sweet malt and chocolate. Very nice roasted malt, wood, and chocolate flavors. I'm usually not a big fan of dry stouts, but I really enjoyed this one!","Fresno, California, USA","flutetokill"
1951,"2004-02-03",4.1,"Comes in a 1 Pint 6 Oz Bomber of brown glass. Label indicates this brew won a platinum medal for dry stouts at th World Beer Championships in 1995. Seems like some old laurels to be resting on, but I will let the beer do the talking.

A vigorous pour produces a nice, cream from the cocoa type head which rests lightly above the beer, shrinking slowly. The beer is deep, black-brown, like the color of shoe polish. Thats about it.

Chocolate malts in the nose, somewhat sweet toffeesish aroma melding with the cocoa like smells.

Smooth and creamy, silky and, surprisingly drinkable. Roasted chocolate embers with a subtle, but ample hop flourish driving behind and into the sweet chocolate malted flavor. Damn nice stout. Doesn't taste dry, however. Almost like a sweet or chocolate stout. Nevertheless, damn good. Yum, this is good!","New York, USA","DCopperfields"
1951,"2004-01-14",3.3,"Another unremarkable beer.  My brother loves this and a couple of others like Coal Porter.  I think you sort of have to drink them in Maine to fall in love with them.  Dark with a big tan head that disappears fast enough to hear the bubbles pop!  Frothy fizzy in the mouth.  Simple taste of chocolate and malt, really light for a stout, really simple for a stout.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
1951,"2003-11-18",4.4,"one of the highlights of my maine vacation. I had the privelage to visit the ""brewery"" and sample a few. Dark coloration with a generous tan head and sharp yet malty aroma.

1951,"2003-11-07",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2008 Excellent stout!  Dark brown, opaque pour with a large head.  Aroma of roast malt, plums and dried fruit.  Flavor is slightly sweet for a dry stout, but excellent, raisin and prune flavor mixed well with the roast malts.  Mouthfeel is like a prune juice.  Finish is well balanced with some hops shining through.  Thanks TAR!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
1951,"2003-11-04",4.1,"Bottle sports a small green sticker that reads 'Brew #1395'.  Luscious dark chocolate aroma, accented by dark brown sugar sweetness, plummy fruitiness, faint spice including cinnamon and anise, roasty espresso and raisin.  Deep ebony color, made opaque by the sediment pour, with a fine, uneven head.  Roasty, bittersweet beginning, seeing a sudden influx of hop flavor and chocolate, with the finish turning bitter, dry, coffeeish and fruity.  Rather carbonated palate with a slightly chewy, medium body.  Exceedingly complex for the style and quite enjoyable.  Cheers, Kinz.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1951,"2003-09-18",4.3,"Tart roasted malt aroma reminds me of chocolate covered cherries, and burnt toast. As the thick head quickly collapses to a sheet of fine particles an earthy aroma comes on as does a vinous quality. Slightly sweet with a bit of roast and turning bananas (esters), banana bread?, on the semi-dry finish. Fantastic Stout!!!","Starkville, Mississippi, USA","baobubba"
1951,"2003-08-21",4.1,"Bottle, black with medium tan head. Chocolate and hops in the aroma. Big and full body, milk, chocolate and coffee, bitterness and slight citric hops. Huge, almost a meal. A real gem of Maine beers.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"
1951,"2003-08-18",4.2,"Prune hued with chestnut highlights.  Creamy light caramel foam.  Airy aroma of concord grape, candied apple, charred cane sugar, musty wood, dark chocolate, and wet earth.  Licorice, tar, vanilla, caramel, and cocoa underpinnings.  Slightly fizzy mouthfeel; however, it remains lightly fluffy and silky.  Mild phenolic flavors.  Only the slightest touch of tingly acidity, which happens to work really well with the mocha flavors.  Hints of wood, cocoa, cotton, and vinous tones.    Buttered toffee notes appear before a succulent backdrop of mocha, caramel, and licorice flavors.  Finishes slightly chalky with a yogurt-like fudge aspect.  This is a black malt monster, and easily the best dry stout Ive tasted.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1951,"2003-08-14",4.8,"Thanks to Mike's mom for lugging these bottles around New England and getting one down to me.  The bottle appears to be hand capped, complete with the same indention I have on my homebrew caps.  Almost totally opaque blackness, large caramel head that subsides slowly into a beautiful veneer of tiny bubbles.  Aroma is a fantastic blend of bitter chocolate and spruce, finely balanced.  Taste is almost identical, starting off with chocalate bitterness, fading into a sprucey, piney finish.  The balance and interplay is just amazing.  An extraordinary brew.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1951,"2003-08-09",4.0,"On the pour a atramentous color, the head Bunyanesque in size, the consistency that of whipped cream and the color a winsome light chocolate brown, as it dematerializes, a fine covering of lace is left behind to meld with the glass. The aroma that of strong coffee, bittersweet chocolate and lots of malt, sweet and malt-laden is the start, the top full and pleasing to the palate. Finish is crisply acidic, bitter-sweet chocolate aftertaste with the hops persistent and pleasant in their spicy bite, all in all a fine representative to the style.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1951,"2003-06-27",4.0,"Excellent dry stout!  Starts off with an initial burst of coffee flavors, but finishes with a sweet, chocolatey taste.  Wish i could find this stuff in my area...","Eldersburg, Maryland, USA","duke33"
1951,"2003-02-26",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2003 Pitch black with a huge, noisy dark tan head. You would have thought with the fizziness of the head that it would have faded quickly, but the fizz subsides eventually and the head sticks around for a while longer. The nose is chocolate, roasty malt, prunes. The flavor is dominated by bitter hops but underneath that are toffee, wood and a hint of milk chocolate. The flavor would be better if they lowered the hops/burnt bitterness and raised the malt profile and complexity but this is still an excellent beer. The mouthfeel is prickly from the high carbonation.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

1951,"2002-07-06",4.3,"22 oz bottle.  Pours black and thick, with thick dark medium head; nice lacing.  Nose pretty sweet for a dry stout but I didnt mind; caramel and chocolate win the battle over espresso here and its a lovely war.  Flavor too is sweeter than I would have expected, and oh so smooth.  Rich, sweet milk chocolate dominates, slight winelike quality and perhaps a hint of blackberries.  Great body.  Wonderful; one of the best beers I picked up on my recent trip to Maine, by far the best from this brewery and the last beer I needed to be convinced that Mainers are great at stouts and porters.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
