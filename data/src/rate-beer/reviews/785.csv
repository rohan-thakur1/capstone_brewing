785,"2015-03-01",3.7,"Enjoyed at the Rapp brewery stop of the rbwg2015 bus tour. Poured up on tap where it exhibits a nice mahogany colored body that supports a thin tan head. The aroma offers up plenty of prune and raisin and a dash of cherry sweet dark fruity esters with some malts in the background. The taste is similar but has far lighter sweet dark fruity esters notes. I get a pleasing dose of chocolate malts, an earthy wet tobacco yumminess leading into biscuit and a bit of caramel malts. Behind the malts lurks modest spicy to almost resiny hop notes.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
