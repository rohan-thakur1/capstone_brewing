A - Pours deep brown, borderline black, with a nice one finger tall off-white head leaving light lacing down the glass.


S - Hints of pumpkin pulp, pumpkin pie spices, sweet chocolate, dark roasted malt, and a tiny bit of smoke toward the end. All things considered this one has some killer balance. Nothing really tried to outdo the others. Well done.


T - Some dark roast up front giving way quickly to a mix of pumpkin, dark spices, sweet chocolate, and some light smoke. The pumpkin is muted but it still holds it own with the rest of these dark flavors. Finish is smokey with some lingering sweet roast. Very nice overall balance, one of the best I have had.

55,"2014-07-04",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2016 November 2nd, 2014 - Midnight Sun impressed me on sip one of the Panty Peeler, so I came into the Treat with high expectations. Dark and rich looking, it looks like a worthy brew to stand against a cold Alaskan night. The nose is full of pumpkin, true to the label featuring a manic, childrens storybook style of the gourd. I also smell apple cider, probably a function of the cinnamon and nutmeg smells, but its richer and more synthesized than simply smelling some spicy scents. The body is medium to medium-heavy in weight, and the flavor begins with a slow percolating swell of cocoa, pecan and molasses. It warms the mouth like a dose of bourbon, adding a beet toothsomeness near the mid-taste. The aftertaste is given over to raisins, which compete aggressively with the pumpkin. Through the journey the pumpkin style is always visible, and yet the flavor is dynamic and shifting, giving this a nice sophistication and engagement that too few vegetal brews have these days.

November 30th, 2012 - Midnight Suns trippel is a knock out, and based on that admittedly small sample size, I was excited to try the agglutinative stylings of the Imperial Chocolate Pumpkin Porter. Thats a lot of flavor profiles to pack onto one name. But the smell lends some credence to the label, showing off malty and sweet scents of pumpkin pie, cinnamon, clove and brown sugar, lending more to the pumpkin part of the label than the others. No chocolate found here, though it makes its appearance in the flavor, a darker type, and dusted with lots of spices, including those found in the nose. The palate is heavy, giving this brew some heft and seriousness, and the dark, malty core is layered with flavors of pumpkin pie, raisin and fig. The overall balance is quite good, making this an apt beer for someone looking for an engaging, spicy brew with reflections of pumpkin pie - a great drink for the Thanksgiving table. 7/3/8/4/14 3.6","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

55,"2014-03-22",4.2,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a dark brown colored body, barely any head but what there is shows a slim film that rises just a tad concavely against the glass and speckles to make some super light lacing.
The smell had spices of ginger, nutmeg, and allspice that dance in front of cocoa and pumpkin, the more I let it warm the more clove and cinnamon come out in a roasted almost earthy sort of way.
The taste is mainly sweet through the cocoa and pumpkin powering just in front of the spices ever so delicately, nice balancing act of the sweet in front of the spicy for the taste - awesome! slight spicy cocoa aftertaste; slightly dry spicy cocoa finish.
The palate is about a medium in body, seems to be more of a sipper but the alcohol remains well hidden. The harshness - what harshness no where whatsoever, but Im not worried; great for the style and for me.

55,"2014-01-19",3.8,"A steady pour into my Sierra Nevada IPA glass produces a three finger thick, nicely brown tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated, dark-chocolate brown color that shows clear, brown-amber hues around the edges when held up to the light. The aroma smells of roasted grain, cinnamon, smoky roasted notes, deeply roasted nutty notes, and even some dark chocolate hints towards the finish.

The beer has a nice dryness to it, considering I was expecting a bit more sweetness from a beer that smells so rich. Rich dark chocolate notes meld with roasted coffee notes, and a roasted nutty, and burnt grain astringency. This has a rich dark maltiness to it that provides just a bit of sweetness, which is accentuated by a solid cinnamon note, and the chocolate note as well. The nuttiness reminds me of notes of roasted hazelnuts. This really does have a nice rich maltiness to it, smoky, richly roasted, and with a burnt caramel color. The body is nice and rich, definitely a sipping brew, but without being overly rich, and certainly not cloying. As the beer warms up a more phenolic edge starts to take hold; especially in the finish where a clove like character starts to mix with the herbal woody side of the hops, and brings out a bit more of the harsh side of the hops.

This is definitely a nice beer, it is rich and satiating without being overly sweet; this plays up the richness and smokiness, which is quite nice.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

55,"2013-12-25",3.8,"So, after purchasing and shipping off a bunch of these as extras in trades, I had to give this one a go...

$14 for bomber @ JBs in Spokane, WA
Poured to NB tulip.

A: Pours a dark, dark brown. Nearly opaque. Little to no head on vicious pour. Thin mocha film on surface that will grow to 1/2 finger with lively stir. Spotted lace on rim.

S: Plenty of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves smell like they were folded into cocoa-ed creme fresh. This was then spread over a slightly charred pumpkin. Very sweet, pleasant, a bit too strong, probably would do well to sit on oak for a month or too to help combat the artificiality of the bouquet. Mellow it a bit. 

T: I wish they would have backed down a tad on the nutmeg and cloves, they seem to dominate this one a little too much. Theres plenty of cocoa remaining on the finish, and the spices seem to balance out a minute or two after the lingering dies down, and this moment of equilibrium satisfies my palate quite well. Too much to tweak to give it a four.

M: Great body on this one. Velvety feel with low carbonation allows for thorough assessment of the flavor profiles here. Slicks the tissue and leaves imprints of the ale on the palate. Nice feel.

D: This a good beer. As I mentioned, there are quite a few things I would tweak to help balance it out just a bit. A little too much nutmeg and clove for me. I would suggest to anybody who already loves pumpkin ales, but not to the newcomer.

Poured into my pint glass. Pours a very thick deep black. This is one of thickest porters Ive ever seen. No light coming through this one, not even on the edges. Small tan head caps this one off. Decent retention, but leaves little to no lace. Smells of pumpernickel bread, gingerbread, molasses, chocolate powder, milk, with a finish of roasted nuts. This is a smörgåsbord of scent! 

The mouth is creamy, yet wet. Not the smoothest, but not lacking in subtle bite either. Just right. These flavors mix ever so wonderfully. The pumpkin is there, but it is mild and tame. The chocolate is also there, but not in your face. This is balanced perfectly. Nice little bite from the hops right smack in the middle as well. Finishes roasted and bready. Dang.

Overall, I thought this one was pretty good, but it was quite as good as I had wanted it to be.  I would have liked a little more pumpkin in the spice, but all-in-all not bad.

Pour is a midnight black with a low tan head and not too much lacing. The nose is really fantastic with some strong notes of chocolate as well as some clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A bit of actual pumpkin and mild sweetness in there as well. The taste mixes chocolate and pumpkin elements quite well. Really nice feel with the proper amount of spice interwoven with the chocolate.

The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head
In long: Nose has a moderate amount of the usual array of pumpkin beer spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) over black chocolate.  Taste is chocolate, slick caramel, dark fruits, usual array of pumpkin beer spices, some vanilla.  Nice body that is big and full yet very silky.  Taste is not so chocolaty for a beer with chocolate in the name.  The typical pumpkin beer spices are not over-done here and are well integrated in the rest of the beer.  Im not much of a fan of this style of beer so my not-so-high rating just reflects my personal preferences.  But objectively, this is a very well made beer.  A nice Halloween beer to remind me that Halloween can be a lot of fun.  But because I live in a big city downtown loft I dont see funny dressed children doing trick or treat anymore.  Just funny dressed women offering tricks and Gonorrhoea.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
55,"2011-02-08",4.6,"Poured a completely opaque jet black, with a half-finger of finely bubbled head that didnt lace much and dissapated quickly. Smell is beautiful, with tons of cinnamon and nutmeg along with a touch of clove, and is accompanied by a soda-pop tart smell that is fantastic. Chocolate pumpkin comes in at the back. In between, some roasted malt to add still more complexity. One of the best smelling beers Ive had in a long while. Taste follows suit with the palate transitioning smoothly between spice, malt, and pumpkin. Starts with those spices of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, then moves a delectably roasted semi-sweet chocolate middle. Pumpkin then begins to rear its big fat orange head, eventually leading to a delicious roasted pumpkin milk coffee finish. Tastes so creamy it is almost milky. Mouthfeel is awesome, as the thickness and lesser carbonation yield a chocolate pumpkin milkshake of a beer. Drinkability is pretty damn good too, as the finish is actually kind of neutral when you take a step back. This is kind of a letdown compared to the rest of the beer, as I would have liked a strong aftertaste to let the beer linger after every sip, but everything else is too good to let that bother me too much. The fact that it finishes so clean, and hides the 7.8% abv so well, speaks the drinkability as well. Pumpkin beers perhaps should not be measured by this one due to its mesh of styles, but this definitely has set the bar for spiced beers in my mind. This probably faded a bit since the initial release, but I can see the flavors melding a bit better now than if it was fresh. Nonetheless, its going to be a long wait to try this fresh this year.

3.5 A: Pretty much black in color. One finger of frothy light brown head with poor retention and only a touch of lacing.

4.5 S: Pumpkin pie hits you first. Theres some pumpkin as well as plenty of the pie spices: clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamon. Chocolate next stemming from the cocoa nibs. The underlying porter is pretty well hidden below the spices. Very nice, but I would prefer an extra kick from everything.

4.0 T: The first sip was divine: awesome mixture of pumpkin pie, chocolate, and porter. However, as you drink this more, the thrill dies out. Its still very tasty, just not mindblowing like the first sip. The pie spices works really well with the chocolate, this might be something Ill need to brew. The porter comes through a lot mor in the taste than in the nose. Slightly charred roastiness with an otherwise clean maltiness.

4.5 M: Lighter medium to medium body. Would prefer a thicker body, but this is okay. Really creamy, which I love. Good here.

4.5 D: This is definitely among the better pumpkin brews Ive had. Id love to have this again. If it holds up well, I might as well trade for a lot of them. The dark flavors and chocolate are awesome with pumpkin and pie spices.

The elements in the beer are fantastic, but as a whole, this odd beverage does not come together perfectly.","USA","Nik925"
55,"2010-11-07",4.0,"I was wary of this one, but it wa great. Subtle aroma of spices, cloves and pumpkin.

One of the rare beers I can smell from quite a distance away. The flavor had a little more chocolate up front, with a nice spicy nutmeg kick and a pumpkin and clove finish.

A delicious chocolate syrup (ala taking a shot of Hersheys right out of the bottle) kick before finishing with the nutmeg.  Leaves a spicey, lingering cloves finish.

Perhaps a touch too much nutmeg for me, though I have a low tolerance for it.  The pumpkin scent is nice though.

Theres some chocolate and caramel lurking in the mix, as well.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin.

55,"2009-12-24",3.9,"Purchased at East Pike Bottle Shop. 22 oz. bottle. Didnt have much of a viscous pour, but a nice black body with a slim head around the edge of the glass. Nice subtle chocolate aroma. Holiday aromas are coming through quite well i.e. I get a nice cinnamon aroma and a very nice clove spice aroma. Pumpkin is coming through in a subtle manner. Very nice nuanced aroma for a spice/herb/vegetable. Wow, this beer has a nice spice flavor that develops. There is a nice porter/stout roast and then with some time you have the cinnamon and clove developing. Ah...the cinnamon pumpkin flavor is very nice and leaves a lasting impression. Could have a SLIGHTLY better texture, but I think this is fairly decent.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Pumpkin pie spices are present but dont overwhelm.

Very well balanced flavors of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg aka the pumpkin spices with the surprising addition of cocoa nibs and pumpkin.  A relatively full-bodied beer Im happy to see the low IBUS, relatively high ABV and ever so slight flavor of actual pumpkin.  Its in the initial nose and later more powerfully in the aftertaste..kinda like a hint of toasted pumpkin seeds, youll see... Thanks to Doug from Malt & Vine for the recommendation.

Very nice to sip, but seems to be going away rather quickly.  I will accredit that to the creaminess and the abv being below 8%.

Pumpkin is there, but it is more subdued, which is a good thing in my book.  The flavor is similarly rich and warm, with a cocoa and brown sugar base spiced perfectly with vanilla and cinnamon, with a glint of crystallized ginger and fresh, fleshy pumpkin notes.  Theres a very faint twinge of tartness that I actually kind of dig in this brew, intentional or not.  Velvety and creamy on the tongue, the palate is almost lactic.  Damn good brew.

Credits goes to Mike I believe for bringing this back from Dark Lord Day but I could be mistaken.  Ever the enigma Midnight Sun has come through with a solid seasonal porter.  While I prefer mine with a bit more sweetness and spice it brings something new to the table.

Aroma / Appearance - The thin tan head and sticky black lacing trickle into a fluid body.  Heavily spiced squash, pumpkin, chocolate, and other autumnal aspects are as advertised yet need a bit more refinement in my opinion.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate whipped cream sprayed generously over pumpkin pie accurately describes this beer.  The spicy finish reminds one of squash with a drizzle of butter.  Moist, spongy, and earthy, it captures most of the best parts of fall with only a few flaws.  As none of them are glaring it gets high marks across everything but the overall score.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The is very interesting with the light pumpkin pie aromas of pumpkin, nutmeg and hints of cinnamon. There are some dark malts in there as well as chocolate though the spices stand out.

The taste is even more interesting to me. It starts with some chocolate and lactose sweetness up front before the pumpkin and spices roll onto the palate. The finish almost seems a bit smoky with some coffee bitterness as well. Really complex taste.

55,"2008-10-31",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2009 bottle from buddy in anchorage...2008 pours a normal dark with nice tan head.   smell wasnt as strong as anticipated, but still had a faint smell of chocolate and  sweetness.

Re-Rate 2009.  Pours dark with a nice tan head.  Smeel seems more aromatic for some reason.  Taste is pumpkin and spices all the way.  Nice creamy mouthfeel with a bit of an aftertaste of hops.  Dry finish but I just love the sweetness of this beer.

55,"2008-10-11",4.5,"22 oz. bottle - thanks to my main man AKBelgianBeast for this one; 2007 vintage; wowzers, so incredibly tasty that i almost cant believe i shared this one with others!!  haha, just kidding of course; dark brown with soft, thick texture; soapy head brings out rich aromas of chocolate, roasted malts and pumpkin spice; very roasty and pumpkin is a calming addition that sits there softly, while providing a very welcome mix to the flavors and spice as a complement; chocolate is dominate and the pumpkin ends up more like roasted pumpkin seeds; and we can all remember from our childhood how tasty baked pumpkin seeds are; so smooth and a perfectly constructed beer; i hope that MS does something with the base chocolate porter; maybe my fav porter, fav pumpkin and fav chocolate beer all rolled into one; just divine; cant wait for the 2008 batch!!","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"

Coffee, chocolate, and pumpkin on the nose. Creamy medium body, woolly carb. Nice sweet pie spice, pumpkin, chocolate, and coffee on the mid-palate, in that order. Every flavor is distinct and well-manifested, but in harmony with all the others. It’s actually tough to focus on any one of them because they’re all so forward and pleasantly so. Long spicy chocolate finish. Wow. Astonishing.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

2008 bottle, pours black with brownish head.

55,"2008-06-11",3.8,"22oz bottle generously donated to our worthy drinking cause by Stine.  Amazingly rich nose of chocolate pumpkin - I guess they nailed that aspect - along with some sweet and sugary chocolate donut notes and some sweetened pumpkin.  At slightly warmer temp the sweet nose turns more towards true pumpkin pulp and meat, more towards a chocolate squash quality.  Flavor is at first roasted pumpkin and greenish squash, then chocolate malt - not heavy but not light - and roasted barley... body is moderately thin, surprisingly, but it still stands up well.  Dont want to say watery, just thin it seems... finishes smooth and pleasant with notes of clove and nutmeg.  Really a unique experience.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Soft spicing (cinnamon, nutmeg), milk chocolate and pumpkin in the aroma; very mildly bitter chocolate and nougat; quite nice.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy clove and nutmeg upfront; soft dark chocolate and bitter chocolate; relaxed carbonation; the pumpkin and spice presence is nicely integrated into the roasted, chocolatey porter core; very drinkable and very tasty, warming stuff (no show of alcohol).

55,"2008-05-29",4.0,"(bottle, from gunhaver) Pours dark brown with a scant off-white head. Im initially greeted with a great baked pumpkin pie aroma with clove as well, but then the porter side of the beer takes over, and scents of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee replace the pumpkin which exhibits a good contrast.  The taste is very balanced as well, with all of the porter aspects of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt making up the flavor.  These malts are teetering on the edge of being too charred and harsh, but somehow they pull it off.  Now at this stage, one would think theyre drinking just an ordinary heavy-roasted porter, but then the amazing finish comes in to remind you youre drinking this great hybrid beer.  The finish is just a dominating dose of baked pumpkin that I really enjoyed.  Even though this beer was somewhat thin, the finish more than made up for it.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Unknown fact about me: I am not a big fan of pumpkin beers as most of them seem to exhibit some phony spice shit that makes me think I am inhaling fumes from some chemistry project gone awry. Lets talk about a pumpkin scratch and sniff that has been stuffed into a beer bottle and then some nasty lager poured into it. BUT not this Pumpkin Porter. This sucker had me thinking I had just gotten off the sleigh at Grandmothers house and had opened the door to the smell of freshly baked pumpkin pie.

Flavor is full of cocoa, vanilla beans, floral spice, and nutmeg.  Pumpkin warmth is slow to arrive but lends a rich, unique sweetness in the mid palate.  Roasted rustic character tends to temper the adjuncts quite perfectly, not wholly silencing them but simply reining them in a bit.  Palate is crisp and medium in body; warm and generous with a feathery touch.  Finishes with a decadent spicy sweetness that tapers off reticently, slowly.  Amazing balance throughout.  Gorgeous.

Wonderfully complex, pumpkin pie nose that brings out elements of ginger and nutmeg spice among a rich toffee malt

brewing ingredient and this is definitely on the more conservative end of the ginger beer spectrum.  Freshly baked 

pecan pie, brown sugar, and a light chocolate nougat malt richness in the middle.  Medium bodied, lightly 

carbonated mouthfeel with a creamy texture.  Flavors of chocolate fudge up front, rich and silky, softened by a 

smooth vanilla toffee character.  Nutmeg, cinnimon, and ginger spice clearly visible, but soft and accenting,

55,"2007-02-18",3.2,"Black with edges of brown.  Lumpy, dirty-gray head slowly scatters, but holds fairly well.  Chalky roast and coffee comprise the straightforward aroma.  Smidgeon of nutty malt, blackcurrants and nutmeg.  Fluffy carbonation gently prickles the tongue.  Dense estery fruitiness and tangy molasses fend off the sharp roast at first sip.  Understated spices impart a vivacious brightness which exaggerates the dryly chalky roastiness.  Somewhat grainy, though a large portion of the brash roast is absorbed by the residual sweetness.  Dirtiness becomes more apparent by the sip, as tacky yeast tangles with overripe plums to contribute an unpleasant limpness to the body.  Nutty java and smoky roast remain assertive, however, and continue to accentuate the brash roast.  Still, the malts fail to produce any noteworthy depth or complexity.  Spiciness augments the dryness, as does the bristling roast.  Tight note of cinnamon lifts the sweetness, although an inordinate amount of tackiness remains glued to the back of the palate.  Finishes with a crunchy note of char amid a lingering blend of soggy caramel-drenched grains, nutty malts and oily java.  Not a poorly made beer by any means, but certainly leaves room for improvement. Perhaps a bit grainy, yeasty and worty for me.  Shame that real pumpkin wasnt employed, as the  starches couldve acted as a counterpoint to the sharp char and graininess.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

55,"2006-11-25",3.7,"My sis brought me home this bottle from Alaska. What a wonderful surprise! Pour is pitch black, with a large, late-rising, lovely brown head. The aroma of this beer is rather dissappointing, unassertive and almost not even there... mild milled grains, toast, slight vanilla, peanut brittle. There is a lot more going on in the flavor, though: chocolate, bitter herbs, nutmeg, a touch of pumpkin, peanut brittle. This beer is ultimately brought down by a sub-par palate... it is slightly thick, though not enough so, but more importantly it has a sharp metallic twang and dull aftertaste, the prior which gets in the way of what would likely be a more complex flavor. By the description, and knowing this brewer, I was hoping Id be able to drop a 4.5+ on this beer, easy. Ultimately, its rather dissappointing. In fact, when it was freshly poured and still cold (around 50), there were very intruiging chocolate and cherry notes that I was sure would come out as it warmed. Instead, they faded into the background, behind the metal shield erected around the brew.

Ah well.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
