529,"2016-10-11",3.7,"750 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 9/3/2011.

Deep red body. Like a carbonated red wine. Maybe a touch lighter, but close. Pours with a nice pink head. Fascinating for a beer. Leaves nice lacing.

Raspberries, whoah. Before the raspberries kick in, it smells musty, too.

Taste is all raspberries. Like raspberry juice, without all the sugar. ItÂ’s still pretty sweet, but not like an actual raspberry. Not a lot of beer flavors coming through here, but still tasty. Nice tartness in the finish to fight off the sweetness.

No booze, amazingly. Tart finish and a little dry. Still a bit heavy, but itÂ’s 9.2%, so I guess thatÂ’s to be expected. Not easy to drink.

Tough beer to review. Unnecessarily large and difficult to drink, but it has a wonderful fruit flavor.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

refreshing. Â  Very much on par with the original one I had in 2008, perhaps the 2007 example. Â  Finishes 

sweet, fruity, loads of raspberries, and just overall very clean. Â  Surprisingly easy to drink, and very

Juicy, authentic and quite sweet. Light vanilla sweetness as well, with touches of alcohol.The flavor is raspberry, malt sugar (honey, vanilla) and light alcohol. The natural tartness and dryness from the acids in the raspberry juice and raspberry seeds seems to be the only thing here attempting to balance. It dosent; not even close. But, I will say the raspberry sweetness, while overpowering and out-of-balance, is still enjoyable in the dessert sense or just for someone who likes raspberries. That being said, the beer displays very little beer character, gets a bit too alcoholic after warming and despite the high sugar content, still seems a bit thin and watery on the finish.

529,"2015-04-13",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2015 Purchased from Cigarrete City yesterday evening. $13.99 for the 750 mL bottle. After doing some research, I found that I could have gotten a hold of this for $11.99 -- but it isnÂ’t that much more. Overall, IÂ’m pleased that I grabbed it when I did. I only know of two places that currently carry it. 
 Opened on a particularly sunny 70Â°F noon, with a happily investigative pit bull mix by my side.
 To long-stemmed white whine glass, it pours a rose-tinted dark red/crimson with which a white bubbly ring not even half a pinky nail in length stood. Quickly diminishing. 
  Aromas of dried cranberries, table sugar, raspberry syrup, sawdust, Belgian yeast, and tea leaves. 
 Tastes much the same with the addition of unripe guava, tangerine zest/molded mandarin orange peel, sweet sorghum molasses flour, and wine dregs. Avocado honey, straw, vanillin, mashed pears, and raspberries experienced by swallow.   I like this, but I canÂ’t in good faith write how much I love this, because, quite frankly, I donÂ’t. ItÂ’s a really damn fine fruit beer, probably the best example IÂ’ve had in months, but as far as I see it, this is a one-time kind of beverage that I would only consider purchasing again if it entailed making sure an ISO friend got to try it at an upcoming share. This has depth: its flavor a tad vinous and its alcohol a bit creepy. I sincerely hope this wonÂ’t irritate any potential readers of this review, but I found the finish to be rife with artificial tropical fruit flavor and just a a touch of vanilla extract; yes, the finish I could have lived without. But no means bad, just... you know... like, thisis indeed a well-balanced, well-crafted brew but I donÂ’t think I could have more than one of these. You feel me?

IÂ’m getting a bit of wheat here, some background hops. IÂ’m pleasantly pleased with the taste profile on this, I was kind of expecting, you know, Belgian-style fruit beer, that it could be too sweet, but this is sweettart level tart if not beyond, which is a good thing. IÂ’m not going to pin a style on this beyond ratebeerÂ’s characterization of it as a fruit beer and the labelÂ’s categorization of it as a ""Belgian Style Ale"", but IÂ’m thinking more in the vein of lambics and sours rather than whit ales, hefeweizens, and saisons. That doesnÂ’t, of course, necessarily speak to the brewing methodology- just what is going on in my mouth (ThatÂ’s what she said). I note IÂ’m one of the first to review here, so IÂ’m a bit nervous about getting this right- I should note that I am not a beer expert and your experience may vary- but I think most people will be happy with this from a taste perspective unless they like their beers very sweet (Which this is not) and were counting on the fruit/belgian thing correlating to sweet.

How: Bottle 750ml, consumed when over 1 year of age. Bottle from my man Tyler.
The look: Cloudy dark red topped by a small pink head.
In long: The intense nose is condensed sweet raspberries mixture. An aroma that is as powerful as it is inviting. In mouth the beer offers a sumptuous mouthfeel with a rich corpulent body supported by a lot of soft bubbles. I tried to find fancy ways to describe the intense sweet raspberry taste of this beer but really all I can say is that it tastes like a raspberry coulis, I wish I had a piece of cheesecake to eat with it, actually IÂ’d pour this beer all over the cheesecake. Totally different from the New Belgium Raspberry Tart (the reference raspberry beer imho), the Blushing Monk is all about extreme decadence. No alcohol presence whatsoever, this decadent beer is surprisingly drinkable because it tastes so damn good that you keep going for more.

Smells of raspberries of course. A little Belgian yeast smell gets through as well. The raspberry is definitely the overpowering scent though.

Raspberry again dominates on the palate. It starts off with a sweetness from the raspberries, but it is far from cloying and this coming from someone who detests most sweeter beers. The raspberries provide a nice tartness at the end of the palate and it finishes pretty dry. I normally donÂ’t like Belgian yeast strains, but the tartness of the raspberry balances the Belgian aspect perfectly. It almost has a lambic quality to it.

Pretty full and syrupy. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, but the mf is definitely not the highlight.

529,"2013-07-16",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2015 Trade from Garry. 2011 Bottle. Thanks! Last Backstage to try that I missed out on. Pours a deep dark red with a dark pink one finger head. Aroma is super sweet raspberry sherbet and just a hint of dry yeast funk, then more raspberries. Beautiful! Flavor follows right on with raspberry sherbet, and somehow super creamy whoah. There might be a hint of yeast in there, but that is stretching. pure raspberry bliss here. Higher carbonation than I expected that really lightens up the sweet raspberry syrup. Otherwise pretty sticky and thick. Not quite NG Rasp Tart but a close second and much more decadent. This is yum!

Trying a 2015 bottle now, and either my palate has changed or something is different here (likely the former). In any case, not as rich and decadent as I remember, and much more sweet and cloying syrup. Decent enough for a few ounces if you are in the mood for raspberries but beyond that itÂ’s just a bit much.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

S: Wonderful tart raspberries right up front that gives way to nice mild sweetness. Some cracker malts round it out.

529,"2012-03-13",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/11/2011.  2011 750 mL bottle poured into a tulip.

A great fluffy off-white sea foam froth rests on top of a full hazy raspberry or cherry colored beer.

The aroma is a huge blast of sweet raspberries. A bit of the tart side of raspberry makes it way across my nose as well, but it is tough to find much else.

Juicy, sweet raspberries come across my tongue right away, and wave after wave of raspberry comes throughout the whole sip. The flavor stops being entirely sweet toward the back, with a slightly acidic tartness providing a little balance. This also prevents it from becoming too cloying. Overall, a one dimensional, but delicious beer.

Overall, this is a fairly sweet beer, and it does have a light syrupy quality. The tartness on the back end creates a bit of salivation and puckering of the lips. Light vinegar acidity. The carbonation is creamy and smooth, and the beer itself is creamy but a bit grainy as well. The body is on the full side, compared to other fruit beers I have had.

529,"2012-02-15",4.2,"Deep garnet body is topped by a rosy , two finger raspberry stained head. The head works its way back in short order leaving a ring around the snifter. A moderate amount of lacing is left elegantly clinging to the walls of the glass. 

The aroma is bright and lively, as macerated raspberries flood the nose. Brewing with fruit can present a challenge to many brewers, even when using fresh product the aroma can appear rather artificial. Founders excels with their use of fruit, pulling out every ounce of fresh berry aroma available. Buried beneath the fruit lies subtle Belgian yeast notes. Slightly peppery, soft phenols meld perfectly into the fruit.

The Flavor displays intensity and restraint. The first sip tastes like a spoonful of homemade raspberry preserves. Strong berry sweetness with an underlying tart finish. The flavor opens up more with warmth, a darker berry sweetness develops and a warming alcohol presence can be felt. While the fruit flavor is dominant the sweetness is held in check, never approaching a cloying level.

Full bodied Belgian ale is very smooth and luscious on the tongue. The carbonation is low allowing the beer to roll elegantly across the tongue. The finish is long and lingering, the succulent raspberry flavor digs deep into the tongue. 

Blushing Monk is a damn good beer, I am very happy to see once again. Certainly not an every day drinker, this is one you want to keep on hand for a special occasion. The flavor is rich and decadent, certainly a sipper.

529,"2012-01-11",3.8,"BottleÂ… Pours a cloudy deep maroon with a mid-sized, creamy, pink head. Good retention. The bouquet offers up big-time fresh, juicy raspberries and a nice note of toffee. Full-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and zippy carbonation. Tastes like raspberry jelly or jam Â– period. Tangy, fruity, raspberry finish that dries out fairly well.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
529,"2012-01-02",3.0,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2012 Been sitting on this one for awhile. Bright red pour, turns darker in my glass plenty of white head and sticky lace. Bright, fresh raspberries in the nose and taste. Fruity sweetness follows, balanced nicely by the tart raspberry presence. Very true to its raspberry roots, much like the New Glarus we opened the other day. This Founders offerin is more tart and sports a rich, full body though. Mild boozy warmth makes for a pleasant finish. An enjoyable brew to split 4 ways, but not one IÃ¢Â€Â™d buy again.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
529,"2011-12-26",4.2,"Pours a dark red color with a medium pink head. Smells of raspberries and a bit of yeast. Tastes of sweet raspberries. Very smooth and easy-drinking , definitely canÂ’t taste the 9%abv. Best fruit beer IÂ’ve had so far.","Virginia, USA","TheChampion"
529,"2011-12-24",3.9,"It pours a deep red color with a pink head. The aroma has a huge wave of  raspberry jam or maybe syrup. A bit seedy which recalls fresh raspberries, but mostly fruit pie-like aromas. The flavor is pretty much the same with raspberry syrup and odd hints of toasty funk near the finish (brett?) A tiny bit soapy on the plate at the very end, but super tasty if your in the mood for this kind of thing. Very full bodied. Would go great with some vanilla soft serve.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
529,"2011-12-23",4.0,"Pours like cranberry juice with a fuzzy white head. Sour aroma of yeast and faint berries. Sweet, slightly sour raspberries (but not overly so), and faint bourbon heat.

529,"2011-12-22",3.8,"Big 750ml bottle pours a slightly viscous, deep blood red with a creamy, pink head.  Looks awesome.  Sexy.  Nose is HUGE with tons of jammy, juicy raspberry, a little chocolate in the background too, strawberry.  Smells like a fruit smoothie.  Flavor is very similar, huge, sweet raspberry, very sweet, raspberry candies, jammy, juicy.  Not at all tart.  Finishes medium bodied and only lightly sweet.  One note for sure, but really highlights raspberry as a fruit.  You can tell the sweet, Belgian beer base cuts the tartness of a natural raspberry.  The wife loved it, fairly drinkable.  If you like raspberry this is a must try.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

529,"2011-10-24",4.2,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy deep red color ale with a large foamy head with good carbonation and some good lacing. Aroma of freshly pressed raspberry with light sweet note is quite incredible and close to the New Glarus beers in terms of aroma. Taste is also a super good mix dominated by loads of pressed raspberry with light tart notes and a well balanced sweetness level. Malt backbone can be felt though doesnÂ’tÂ’ play a huge role. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I wasnÂ’t expecting this much from a fruit beer and couldnÂ’t understand the hype.

Aroma of cough medicine, sweet raspberries, Graham cracker and alcohol. Thick full syrupy body that would have reminded me of cough syrupy if it wasnÂ’t for the strong carbonation.

I wasnÂ’t disappointed, and I actually think this is an even better beer than the NG fruit beers (which are too sweet to drink in any quantity).

Intense fruity aromas, something akin to Raspberry jam and some brown malt.

Nose is raspberry puree, seeds, malt, candy sugar, caramel, slight vanilla, and a table sugar.  Flavor is sweet as hell with raspberries all up in there.  Whatever they did to the raspberries yielded the fruit, the pulp, the skin, and the fuzz along with every noticeable quality of a raspberry.  The quad is a bit lost, but it plays a nice supporting actor role like Gary Sinise in Forest Gump.  The quad qualities are really nice as the candy sugar melds well with the candy sugar in the quad.

529,"2011-09-06",4.2,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter. 2011 release - canÂ’t find a date but assume it was bottled in June.

Appearance: Gorgeous ruby red with thick pure pink head, leaving nice pink lacing. When there is only a little liquid left in the glass, the beer looks more pink than red.

Aroma: Raspberry (of course), pepper and very light clove & banana from the yeast. Manages to smell sweet, dry and tart at the same time.

Taste: Wow - strong sweet and tart raspberry juice. Slightly earthy, but otherwise not getting much Belgian yeast. Ends with a touch of pepper to go along with the lingering raspberry tartness.

Palate: Very thick, chewy and warming. DoesnÂ’t really feel like a beer (more like carbonated fruit juice mixed with Port), but it suits it just fine.

Overall: Very impressive, and I like it quite a bit more than Cerise (never tried RÃ¼bÃ¦us).

529,"2011-08-31",3.6,"Bottle with Pat. Pours a dark velvet with ruby, bubbly head. So weird to see a dark purple colored head.Settles down to leave a slick surface with some spotty suds. Aroma is pure raspberry jam, with hints of hibiscus and some soft notes of cotton candy, strawberry and bubble gum. Flavor is very sour, pungently tart raspberry juice with some subtle biscuity, malty hints; the palate is very sticky and syrupy. Other notes of vanilla and artificial raspberry. Finish is ever so slightly sour before fading to a calm, even raspberry sweetness. Too much sugar for me. Good beer, and an efficient concealer of its alcohol content, but not meant to be split between two people. This beer is worth trying, but I canÂ’t understand all the hype and prices some bottles are going for. I guess this is related to Founders top quality and maybe limited distribution but I have to check on that. Cheers","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

Nose is fresh raspberry dessert, more like sweet raspberry preserves rather than tart, seedy raspberries. Taste is is good- sweet but not sugary, rich raspberry dessert, almost like quenching fruit punch. Loads of raspberry jam piling on. I like it, but it doesnÂ’t have the subtlety of New Glarus Raspberry Tart, which not only has intense raspberry component but also something aloof like dense wheat beer and rustic grain. Overall, NG Raspberry Tart is a few good beer with loads of raspberries all over the place. This feels completely like raspberry preserve fruit punch, which is delicious but so far flung from ""beer"" categorization. 9.2% is completely unnoticeable, which is pretty scary.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Pours a deeper black cherry hue, predominantly opaque and then topped with a lighter pink head that quickly dissipates to a wispy film leaving a bit of residue on tap... Aroma is syrupy, thick and sweet with a strong deep raspberry presence. Some yeasty notes mingle alongside the aforementioned. Hints of cloyingness which doesnÂ’t seem all that refreshing... Flavors are an improvement at least for me. Assertive raspberry notes which commences first with a sweeter profile upfront and through the middle. Not as much of a yeast presence in the flavor.

This beer pours a full bodied dark red, reminiscent of a framboise, with a two finger, ValentineÂ’s Day pink head. It smells of Belgian yeast and sweet and tart raspberry puree. The raspberry is overpowering and delicious. It tastes of sweet raspberries, first and foremost, with a moderate tartness and a Belgian yeast finish. It offers complexity in terms of raspberry, offering every aspect of the fruit, but the beer itself is dominated by the raspberry. It is delicious and is like an imperial framboise. It drinks full in body and really is a big beer. I couldnÂ’t be more pleased with it. ItÂ’s an exceptional beer and one of my all-time favorites.

Pours a bright light purple color that is quite similar to a light grape juice. Really nice head with a slight pinkish hue. Spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings loads of raspberry to the level of BarqÂ’s Raspberry Cream Soda. Not much depth, but I donÂ’t really care, especially once it gets into the flavor. There is some slight yeastiness on the backend of the flavor, but for the most part this is just a raspberry assault that is absolutely beautiful. Some light earthiness, especially in the feel. Lightly tart and fairly sweet, though not too much. Really outstanding beer.

A raspberry pie filling hue with a small pinking purple frothy head that dies to a tiny film, laces small. Aromas are a rich sweet berry presence, tannins, genuine fruit feel that throws a touch of tartness, pulp, and more fruit. Lush raspberry presence. Initial is medium bodied, a potent sweet and tart berry presence, luscious raspberry pulp and seeds, deep crimson berry sweetness. Genuine fruit, less tart than the New Glarus version. Sweet and rich berry, pulpy with the tartness coming on into the backend. Raspberry is one of my favorite all-fruit pies, and this reminds me of it so much. Rich real fruit/berry presence. Finish is raspberry skin/tannins with some decent tartness, pretty good, maybe a touch syrupy and or cough drop-y, but not into any sort of cloying realm. Based on my memory of the original, this is considerably sweeter.. But then again, that one was aged.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
529,"2011-07-20",4.0,"25 oz bottle.  Deep bloody red with pink froth.  Nose is raspberry jam and ginger ale with a slight metallic tang.  Thick and syrupy but not as sweet as you would expect.  Reminds me of melted Jolly Ranchers with a faint sparkle.  Taste is raspberry, blackberry and candi with a touch of yeast to dry it out.  Intensely fruity and thatÂ’s an understatement.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
529,"2011-07-19",4.5,"Bottle.Pours a deep red with great carbonation.Nose is raspberry,bready yeast notes.Taste is awesome....bright,tart almost sour raspberry.Mouth feel is just perfect with tart and creamy goodness all around.Truly stellar fruit beer.One of the best.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","randy1301"
529,"2011-07-17",3.8,"Thanks for sharing, bro.  Pours a bright raspberry color with a medium pink head.  Aroma is acidic, raspberries.  Taste is sweet and refreshing raspberries and not overly cloying.  Palate reminds me of aged blue cheese.......it was kind of weird.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"
529,"2011-07-17",4.4,"Draft @ Founders, DEEP raspberry red w/ minimal head, aroma is rich fruit, heavy raspberry and pomegranate, flavor is a flood of vinous berries, with a dry finish, spectacular","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","pellegjr"
529,"2011-07-17",4.0,"750ml bottle, 2011 bottling.

Pour is crazy for a beer, looks like a carbonated red wine. Deep burgundy red with lighter pink edges underneath a small pink head that recedes to a thin collar.

Aroma is raspberries, obviously, with some underlying Belgian notes, some malts and yeast. But the raspberries are the star here.

Taste is like raspberries dipped in brown sugar with hints of the earthy yeast underneath. Big malty backbone comes through as well though, again, itÂ’s all about the raspberries. Not even a trace of alcohol which is surprising.

Mouthfeel is full bodied for a fruit beer. Might be the biggest fruit beer IÂ’ve ever had actually.

This is a seriously big raspberry beer, though I never would have guessed the ABV. I wouldnÂ’t exactly call it drinkable as he sweetness is pretty massive but I enjoyed it nonetheless.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
529,"2011-07-17",4.7,"Tart yet fruity sweet. From the bright pink head to the last dark red drop, this beer aims to please, and, for me anyway, it totally succeeds. ItÂ’s definitely a fruit beer and makes no qualms about it. A punch of fresh raspberry (like eating the fruit, not simply raspberry flavored) is present all the way through with a lasting sweet and tart finish. IÂ’m going to have to grab another before it sells out!","North Carolina, USA","jtd6628"
529,"2011-07-17",4.2,"Pours deep ruby into a snifter. Bright pink conglomerate head with medium retention recedes to hug rim. Sweet crushed raspberries and seed aromas.

529,"2011-07-16",3.9,"Sample at Founders. Everything about this one screams raspberry, from the color to the aroma and, yes, the taste. ItÂ’s quite tart, with some sweetness. The palate is syrupy, yet not too thick. ItÂ’s very tasty. Certainly worth a try, and is well suited to be a dessert beer.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
529,"2011-07-16",3.8,"Bottle. Accidently dropped it and the cap came off. Ruby pour with pinkish head. Raspberry, belgian candied sigar, yeasts, and some hints of alcohol aroma. Flavor follows, sweet and ends a bit more dry and warm.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
529,"2011-07-16",3.5,"Bottle - 750mL crowned. Pours dark magenta with a foamy pink head. Strong berry, raspberry preserves and candied fruit in the aroma. Taste is slightly tart berries, raspberry preserves, cherry pie, and candy. This is sweet but not too over the top. Body is very light and bubbly with a sugary stickiness. Finishes with more tart berry, raspberries jam, Smuckers-like jam, hint of cherry pie and more candy.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
529,"2011-07-15",4.1,"Bottle via trade with a friend in Michigan, thanks Mike!  Pours a deep, dark purple to almost black.  You only know it is purple when you see the light pink head that is minimal to non-existent unless you really pour at just the right angle.  The aroma is heavy raspberry beyond belief.  I immediately compare it to Raspberry Tart but feel this has even more of a nose.  The taste is once again, raspberry juice.  If it left with that I would have been disappointed but then at the end the slight malt bill and alcohol come into play.  The alcohol on this really makes me bump it up even more because it lets you know you arenÂ’t drinking a sparkling raspberry cider over Thanksgiving dinner when you were 10.  It adds, does not detract.  Overall this is an outstanding beer.  Too sweet to have all the time but glad I got to try this and will look to land another bottle before itÂ’s all gone for the season.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
529,"2011-07-15",4.2,"Bottle. Popped open a bottle by my lonesome tonight as I really wanted to try this one and it sitting in my fridge was way too much a temptation on a friday night. Pours an extremely dark rosie, red color with a deep reddish pink head. Hmm, ever so slight belgian yeast esters upfront that then gets dominated by a hard core raspberry aroma. I have a feeling on this one that the taste is going to follow the nose. Raspberry, raspberry, and a touch of additional raspberry. Head settles to form a pink collar around the glass. As with the nose, their is a slight belgian flare to this that quickly transitions to a full frontal assault of raspberry flavor. Tart and sweet. Slight bitter in the end. Leaves the mouth feeling like it just ate something really sweet. Medium mouthfeel. I need to try this next to New Glarus Raspberry Tart to see which I like better, but this is really good as a sweet fruity beer.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
529,"2011-07-15",3.9,"2011 Bottle; Pour is dark raspberry, with a dark pink head that retains on the average side; average lacing is present in this glass as well. The nose is raspberry jam and alcohol. This brew is sweet, tart, raspberry jam, raspberry seeds, with a malt profile that takes a back seat to the raspberry character - its just a wow beer for me because of how different it feels.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
529,"2011-07-14",4.3,"Pours purple with a pinkish purple head. Aroma is sweet raspberries. Flavor is again lots of raspberry starts sweet and finishes lightly tart, a little spicy yeast, and earthiness.","Kearney, Missouri, USA","topherh"
529,"2011-07-14",3.8,"Bottle from SamÂ’s in Durham. Pours dark ruby, but clear. One-finger head the color of strawberry milk. Lovely, strange pour. Nose is fresh mashed raspberries, along with a strong raspberry seed character and bitter wood notes. Hints of Belgian yeast; less so than the original, I think. Something a bit plasticky deep in the aroma that throws me off a bit. Taste is thick raspberry syrup at first, but the finish is more earthy and surprisingly dry. Full, syrupy palate. I feel a slight disappointment in that I wanted something tart, but IÂ’m fascinated by these woody/seedy/earthy notes.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"

529,"2011-07-14",4.2,"Draft. Pour is a dark hazy pink with an excellent white head, good retention/lacing. Aroma is fresh raspberries and not much else. Flavor is mouth puckering raspberries which mellows to sweet raspberry juice. Palate is soft, slick, clean finish. Really outstanding and on par with New Glarus but with distribution outside of Wisconsin!","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"
529,"2011-07-13",4.2,"What a delightful beer this was.  Pours a rich raspberry color with intense pink bubbly head. Aroma is of intense raspsberries, light floral hops and mild malt aroma.

529,"2011-07-13",4.3,"On tap at Founders Brewing. Dark purple-red pour with very pink foam. Aroma of pure raspberry, seeds and all. Taste is sweet, with only a slight ""natural"" tartness from the raspberries and finishes with a slight touch of belgian ale yeastiness as though to make sure the sweet fruity flavors donÂ’t go on forever. Palate has medium carbonation and is quite full bodied. I never thought I would like this beer so much, it was our favorite of the night @ Founders.","Trois-RiviÃ¨res, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

Flavor is sweet, raspberry, some spicy Belgian yeast, with a sweet, raspberry finish.  Not as tart as New GlarusÂ’s Raspberry, but just as good.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
529,"2011-07-11",3.8,"Tasted on 7/5/11 on draft at Founders.  Pours a cloudy dark blood red with nothing more than a thin collar of pink lace.  The nose is slightly earthy yeast with a bit of caramel and bread malt coming through, but the focus is, of course, the raspberries, which range from tart to syrup sweet.  The flavor is pretty perfect with the sweet and tart raspberries at the center of attention.  There is also some earthy yeast and some caramel malt.  The body is full with mouth-filling lively carbonation and a long sweet and tart raspberry finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
529,"2011-07-11",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2011 Pour from bottle is pinkish purple with very pink colored head, fizzy but lasts and coats the glass.  A crazy looking beer, in a good way, especially for a raspberry beer.  Aroma has notes of slight bread and yeasty components, raspberry jam with a touch of tart.  Taste is some sweet, slight tart raspberries, leading into bready and slightly spicy notes, finishing with a touch more raspberries, slighty dry but mostly sweet.  Rerated, way more raspberries in this beer, not overly sweet actually tart. Good stuff.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
529,"2011-07-11",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2015 Deep merlot in color with awesomely pink/purple head that fizzes and dissipates.  Floral raspberry aroma.  Solid raspberry flavor that starts semi-sweet, morphs to tart then ends with a trailing tartness and a bit of bitterness.  Huge on the palate.  Nice complexity and balance.  WhereÂ’s the booze hiding? Very impressed, especially since I can walk out my door and get Raspberry Tart whenever I want.  Kudos to you Founders, this was great.  Re-rate:  just not digging as much as the original release.  Flavor seems more muted, sweet, and less sour.  Overall still solid. -4","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
529,"2011-07-11",4.6,"Deep Red color, light pink head. This was very easy to drink, I generally donÂ’t enjoy sweet fruity beers. This was unlike any I have ever tried, had genuine flavors that included not just sweet but tart tastes as if it was a smoothy.

529,"2011-07-09",4.4,"750 ml bottle, 2011 vintage.  Served in a flute, the beer pours a ruby red/purple color with about a half inch dark pink head that went away quickly.  Not much lacing.  The brew smells like fresh sweet raspberries, raspberry jam and a bit of tart raspberries.  Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like sweet raspberries and raspberry jam along with some tart raspberry, too.  Also, thereÂ’s a little bit of bready yeastiness noticable.  But this beer is definitely all about the raspberries!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, itÂ’s creamy and has moderate carbonation.  ItÂ’s smooth and very easy to drink.  I think this is a pretty good overall brew, itÂ’s certainly one of if not the best raspberry beers IÂ’ve ever had.  Even at $14.99 a bottle IÂ’d definitely buy this again in the future, I thought it was worth the money.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

There is a bit of sweetness, but overall it is pretty dry for a fruit beer that is over 9% abv.  Really enjoyable aroma.  Medium / full body with a bit of seedy feel and a bit of gentle flowing carbonation at the end.  Starts with raspberries that are a bit on the tart side.  Raspberries are at the forefront at every point of the taste here.  There is some pepper, light star anise and a crispness towards the end.  There is no alcohol to be found on the taste - pretty impressive for a beer of this strength.  Really great fruit beer.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

The raspberries just pour out of this on the front end and the tartness on the back.  Solid lively carbonation in this medium  bodied beer.
