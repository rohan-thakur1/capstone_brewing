Pours orange golden with a nice slice of foam on the surface. Well well, this aint your old mans wheat beer. Brings to mind the hop forward delight of Great Lakes Miami Weiss. Nice full hop bitterness, with an interesting slice of orange citrus underneath. Very enjoyable on cask. Youd love it if you could get your messy mitts on it. Hope to see them do more casks.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
