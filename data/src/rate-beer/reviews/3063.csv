3063,"2017-06-03",4.6,"Gedronken tijdens Borefts 2016, uitgeschonken vanuit een fles. Diepe donkerbruine kleur, licht troebel met roodachtige gloed, een kleine kakikleurige schuimkraag. De aromas zijn zeer vineus en complex van karakter, echt een Barley Wine. Eikenhout, rode wijn, vanille, chocolade, kokos, donkerfruit als vijgen en dadels. Het smaakpallet volgt de aromas vol en rijk, fruitig vineus en licht zoet, complex met vele smaaklagen. Eerst karamel, chocolade en donker fruit, daarna rode wijn en vanille, met een zachte verwarmende afdronk van eikenhout. Zachte carbonatie, met een verfijnd en vol olieachtig mondgevoel. Zeker een van de beste bieren van Borefts 2016, sowieso de beste Barley Wine. Graag nog eens een fles zien te bemachtigen, om dit complexe bier verder te doorgronden, echt een aanrader voor de liefhebber van sterke en complexe bieren.","Waalwijk, NETHERLANDS","Batavi"

 Kolor:  Ciemnobrunatny, wpadający już w czarny. 
 Piana:  Jak na takie parametry, 
to piana i tak jest niezła. Ma ona jasnobeżowy kolor i drobną strukturę.
Dość szybko redukuje się do całkiem sporej wstążeczki.
Ta obrączka cały czas wisi nad piwem.
Pięknie tez krążuje na szkle. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jaki wydobywa się z butelki to jest po prostu poezja. Pierwsze nuty zapachowe to owoce: ciemne i te czerwone. Dojrzałe winogrona, czereśnie, wiśnie, śliwki.
Zaraz za nimi ogrom wanilii, karmelu, toffi, słodkiej czekolady, melasy i wiórek kokosowych.
Ogromna porcja beczkowych elementów. Czuć zarówno mokrą dębinę, jak i owocowe klimaty. Z pewnością można stawiać na beczkę po bourbonie, whisky, czy Cognacu. Piwo jest potężnie złożone, wielowymiarowe w zapachu.
Z każdą minutą dochodzi do tego coś nowego. 
Aromat po prostu miażdży! 
 Smak:  W smaku intensywnie owocowe. Co tu się nie wyprawia! Śliwki, jabłka, ciemne winogrona, gruszki, czereśnie. Jest bardzo dużo słodkich posmaków: karmel, czekolada, toffi, creme brulee.
Wyraźnie czuć wpływy wielu beczek. Raz po raz pokazują się nuty szlachetnych alkoholi takich jak: rum, Cognac, whisky, bourbon czy czerwone wino.
Dębowe klimaty przeplatają się z owocowymi estrami.
Alkohol jest fajnie rozgrzewający, już na pograniczu wychodzącego na wierzch, ale jeszcze na akceptowalnym poziomie.
Tekstura nie jest jeszcze ulepkowata, ale jest gęsta.
Doskonały ""sipper"". Można się z nim cały wieczór bawić. 
Doskonała robota. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Ten Barley Wine jest blendem różnych warek tego piwa, które były leżakowane w różnych rodzajach beczek po różnych alkoholach.

Gigantyczny Barley Wine. Wielowarstwowy, kompleksowy,,ułożony w aromacie i smaku.
Ogrom składowych może zaskoczyć wielu smakoszy i wielbicieli tego stylu.
Piwo jest intensywnie owocowe, słodkie z wieloma elementami najlepszych deserów świata.
Leżakowanie w wielorakich beczkach nadało trunkowi cech charakterystycznych dla poszczególnych szlachetnych alkoholi.

Aroma:

Heavy aroma of malts, caramel, wood, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, chocolate, molasses and roasted malts.

Appearance:

Opaque dark brown beer with slight yeast and with no/a slight beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts heavy sweet with malts, caramel, wood, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, chocolate and molasses; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. I have no idea on what barrels they aged it, but it sure as hell works out perfectly. Shamefully the head disappears quite quickly.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Au final, une superbe conclusion à ce festival, et cela venant dune brasserie que javais un peu sous estimé au profit dautres qui mont plus que déçu par des mélanges et des idées sur papier qui dans le verre étaient plus que pénible à boire.
Bref, ce barley verse un bon brun sans col mais assez trouble et finemetn doré voire huileux au verre.
Le tout est sur des effluves de malt caramélisé presque de toffee-bonbon anglais avec un excellent côté oxydé et presque balsamique tout en gardant ample douceur mais arrivant en toute fin de bouche. Épais ponctué par un sucré résiduel qui reste marqué et un fruité noir alternant entre des figues, des dates et baies. Retrouve aussi une touche de raisins secs.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Very complex aroma starting with caramel and dark chocolate, later vanilla taking over control. Some woody presence and whicky notes are also pretty easy to pick up. Taste starts fairly sweet and vailla like, chocolate playing the supporting role in teh back. Alcohol, whisky like is easily felt, but still 12% are nicely tucked away.

Woh - alcohol is the first thing you notice in the aroma. Plenty of bourbon. Very rich malts, but the alcohol is fiery - in particular in the finish. Palate is heavy with the malts, theres no uplifting aspects at all. Its not exactly sticky, but certainly a bit oppressive.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Very tasty! Complex, dense and quite boozy, but drinks 
smooth, alcohol isnt as dominant as the ABV suggests. Great balance between various barrel notes and dark roasty, but also sweet notes. Clearly the best Barley Wine from Austria so far for me, on par with American examples and a new highlight by Bevog.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

Dry, full sweet maltiness, sticky, dark fruits, plum jam, light alcohol, vague soy sauce, slightly dusty. Quite nice really. Strong raisins in the taste, but not overbearing, silky mouthfeel, surrounded by a well integrated mild saltiness, sorta reminiscent of salmiakki, though, of course, far more balanced, caramelly. Vague alcohol flavor, but the warming effect is quite strong, making the decision to release it in the middle of summer baffling. Quite light, easy-going taste for the ABV all in all making it very, very drinkable for the strength. Pretty great all in all.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
