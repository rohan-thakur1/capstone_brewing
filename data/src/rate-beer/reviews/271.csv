271,"2015-08-16",2.8,"Bottle at ChrisOs Pre - GBBF tasting 2015. It pours clear as one might expect. The nose is toasted grain, umami, rice pudding and cereal. The taste is bitter, boozy, rice paper, pear, peach, passion fruit and some creaminess with a dry finish. Medium body and slick, hot mouth - feel. A bit rough around the edges of truth be told. OK anyhow.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
