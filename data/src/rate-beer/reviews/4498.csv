4498,"2017-03-21",2.2,"On tap @BBF16. The aroma has iodine, medicines, booze. Black coloured beer with no head. The taste is very boozy, bit sweet, medicinal, peaty. Not much of the delicate Esra left. Rather thin bodied for an eisbock. To put it nicely; it is not really good.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"

Smell is pure alcoholic, harsh poor white spirit alcohol with overly big raw peat; taste is just harsh varnish, purely alcoholic, pure white grain, nail polish, massive unbalanced peat. Ashes. Thick basically flat varnish boozy syrup. I disliked the base beer so there is no surprise that I dislike the Eisbock version as well. I feel about the same about the both of them.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
