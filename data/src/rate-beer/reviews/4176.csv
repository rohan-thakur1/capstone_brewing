4176,"2016-06-10",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed this one at the Brew Crew Bash in Ann Arbor on May 21. This one was poured from a 32 oz growler. The pour is a medium black, thick and oily, with a thin khaki colored head that falls to a thicker ring, offering no lace. The aroma is surprisingly malty. There is a ton of roastiness, a good chocolate, more of a bitter cocoa than a sweet chocolate, and a nice burnt sugariness. There is a distinct nuttiness to this one, but its almost like a light hazelnut. Its pretty good, thats for sure. The flavor is a little more of a mess. There is a light chocolate, and a surprisingly strong dark fruit on the top end. The sugar seems to add a level of sweetness that doesnt fit in, and the nuttiness gets a bit out of place. The mouthfeel is pretty decent. Theres a medium body and a soft to medium carbonation that lets it sit on the palate nicely. The aftertaste is all malt and chocolate bitterness. Its an interesting brew, but pretty tasty.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4176,"2013-10-02",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2014 Growler: Solid, pitch black. Completely opaque, even at the edges. Khaki colored head that foams up nice and forms a soapy tarp across the black beer. Aroma is heavily roasted malt, cocoa notes, and decent char. Successive whiffs bring cocoa nibs with a little more sweetness. Not much of a ""nutty"" aroma, really. Taste is a little more sweet, with some milk chocolates, cocoa, and a bit of roast. Theres finally a sign of slight nuttiness riding the coattails of the cocoa. Great mouth feel; silky and smooth and not too think, retaining drinkability. Not much nuttier than most other porters, but still a good porter nonetheless.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
4176,"2013-05-20",3.7,"The beer lives up to its name.  Very nutty with nice bitter chocolate undertone.  Deep brown in color with slight creamy head.  Seems a bit flat, but its good nonetheless.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
4176,"2013-05-18",3.8,"Growler: The aroma consists of chocolate/cocoa powder with a touch of fruit and nuts. It pours a dark brown with some orange highlights and a small off-white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate, sugar, and a touch of fruit. The finish has light vanilla and roasted nuts. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall, its solid, but the nuttiness is less than I would have expected.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
4176,"2013-05-17",3.4,"Growler. Pours light brown with super fast fading head. Peanut aroma. Taste is thin sweet peanut and coco.","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
4176,"2013-04-29",3.6,"On tap, pours black/dark brown, notes of light roast, milk chocolate, lighter to medium body, nuts. Very drinkable, thin, and somewhat homebrewish but in a good way if that makes sense. Prolly doesnt make sense. Oh well.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

A - Pours deep brown with a half finger tall off white head leaving little to no lace down the glass.

S - Smells of fresh roasted nuts, bakers chocolate, day old coffee grounds, dark roasted malt and some light sugary sweetness.

T - Starts off with some chocolatey sweetness quickly giving way to the fresh roasted nuts, dark roast and some light vanilla sweetness. Taste only gets better as it warms to room temperature. Finish is pretty light all things considered, not lingering on the palate for very long.

M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. It packs lots of flavor without being overpowering which is surprising considering the flavors in question.

O - Not the typical heavy, overpowering PB beer I am used to having after trying quite a few of them now. It has lots of flavor yet it is easy to consume, especially at only 5%. Definitely worth a shot if you get a chance.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
