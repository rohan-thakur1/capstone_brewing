4253,"2016-06-25",3.8,"On draft at Kuhnhenn Warren for the Summer Solstice. The pour is a medium brown, some darker hints shining through. There is a light tan head that falls to a collar leaving a bit of lace. The aroma is. Dry black currant for days. There is just a hint of the actual 5D in here, which is a bummer. Its fruity and sweet, lightly boozy and decent. The flavor is disappointing. Its really thin and dry. The currant is present, but really lacking. The 5D is incredibly thin and leaves a light roastiness. The mouth feel is thin and watery with a light carbonation and a lingering lightly fruity flavor. Light caramel and decent 4D character to it, but its just so messy and light with the addition of currants. Fuck.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4253,"2014-01-06",3.2,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2014 [Bottle / 2007 / 6+ years old] Thanks, Mike! Deep brown & prune colored body with hints of ruby & red, absolutely no head on the pour, only a few, small bubbles that rise to the top & immediately pop. Aroma is like chocolate covered berries. Notes of raspberry, currant, & blackberry, all covered in a sweet, candy-like chocolate essence, almost akin to a Tootsie Roll. Back-end notes of red grapes, with burnt toffee & caramel. Taste is very sweet & very hefty, though not particularly boozy considering the ABV. Chocolate candy sweetness, raspberries seem to be jumping out with a mild currant, prune, & grape-y underlayer. Oxidation has taken place just a bit, but not bad for a 6+ year old beer. Very sweet, grows even sweeter with time, & even gets a little bit cloying. The booze is more apparent as well. Still a nice beer, smells amazing, just not exactly something Id seek out. Three ounces was plenty, & even that took a while to get down. Decadent & sweet like the eisbocks, though this one grows somewhat cloying & overly sweet where the eisbocks do not (as much, anyway). A dessert beer, all the way.

The pour is this slightly murky dark brown with a little red in it with a thin head that never full develops before fading away completely.  Nothing at all left on top so no lacing.  This is very smooth going down with some alcohol burn settling in the back of the throat.  But in a good way.  Im surprised how drinkable this is considering how strong it is.  Creamy caramel, chocolate covered fruit (most notably raspberry but maybe even some cherry too), vanilla, and boozy flavors.

4253,"2011-04-14",3.7,"Reviewed from notes. Poured into a flute.

Color is a dark reddish-brown with no real head. The aroma slaps my nose silly with really strong fruit components. I get some black currants, cherries, berries, and a pretty nice amount of dark sugars. The taste pretty strong as well with a lot of fruit, and then the booze kicks in a tiny bit, making it a bit less enjoyable than the nose. Feel is great with some nice warming alcohol. Drinks really well and I was actually disappointed I didnt have too much more after my first flute full of this.

4253,"2011-03-30",4.3,"Bottle thanks to Ryan Meray! 6.3oz bottle poured into my Narke tulip...Pours a really dark mahogany, bordering on eggplant purple. Not surprisingly, no carbonation. Comparing to other Kuhnhenns, specifically KRE, this looks a lot better...Awesome aroma that has a wonderful red grape backbone, freshly squeezed grape juice that I remember sucking down as kid. Complimented by toffee, syrupy molasses and vanilla. A hint of the 15% alcohol creeps in, but its used perfectly to break up the sweetness. Cant imagine a 15%, or beer with fruit smelling better...The taste lets me down ever so much, I think particularly because the alcohol is not as well hidden at all. The grape juice quality is still there but mostly only shows on the front. I get a ton of alcohol not bad grain, but just prevalent. There is a slight tart finish, blackberries are shown off in a great way, sweet but tart. Toffee, vanilla and wood come in too. There is a slight chalky taste and feel that is by biggest complaint, not sure if this has gotten old already!..The feel is warm, chalky and tannic.

degree. &nbsp Strong Cassis flavor on the tongue, but along with that it reminds me heavily of the Raspberry Eisbock simply because of the Tootsie Roll like flavor. &nbsp Very warming, but not alcoholic, so having said that I would say 

the ABV of 16.5% ABV is very well hidden. &nbsp I am surprised to see that the body and mouthfeel are fairly moderate. &nbsp Again, this beer is warming but not boozy. &nbsp The Tootsie Roll sweetness hides it, much like the Raspberry 

Eisbock. &nbsp I actually like this one better than that one. &nbsp Cassis flavored beers is rare, and this one certainly has some of that flavor associated with it. &nbsp Good beer, warming, lots of Cassis flavor but also some of that

4253,"2009-12-23",4.3,"12oz bottle courtesy of masonjer poured into a snifter.

Pours a hazy reddish brown with a bubbly tan head that shows fair retention and leaves a solid collar and spotty lacing.  There are definitely some boozy legs clinging to the sides.

Whoa, this aroma blew me away!  Just massive currant aroma but with tons of brown sugar, caramel and chocolate.  It smells like a chocolate covered fruit dessert...decadent nose.

The taste is more of the same with the currants dominating with a tart sweetness that lasts from start to finish.  The big sweet sugary malt backbone is more than enough to support the fruit and the finish is almost like a tootsie roll...weird I know.

The mouthfeel is full bodied but with solid carbonation that keeps it from getting cloying or overly syrupy.  The alcohol is definitely there.  Im not sure Id peg it at 15%, but it has a solid burn going down.

Ive been disappointed by a few infected Kuhnhenn bottles, but beers like this are what keep me coming back for more.  If they could get their quality control issues under control, theyd be one of my top breweries without a doubt.  I love this beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

4253,"2009-02-11",3.3,"December 07 vintage, aged about 14 months in the bottle.  Pours a dark and murky mauve color with hints of plum.  A minimal, fizzy, off-white head dissipates completely, and rather quickly.  Dense, sugary sheeting slowly glides down the glass.  The aroma is quite potent, showing more like a liquor than a beer.  Massive amounts of sweet and tangy cassis dominate the underlying fig and plum notes.  It takes a real effort, but I can extract some brown sugar malts, along with a good bit of ripe red grape and vanilla laden oak.  The flavor follows suit, a ridiculous amount of cassis and dark fruity sweetness crushing everything in its path.  Oak and vanilla rush in to fill the void that the avalanche of fruit leaves behind, but are again quickly taken over by an aftertase reminiscent of the filling of a Fig Newton.  Quite boozy and somewhat medicinal, the ample sweetness saves this one from being unbearably hot.  Thick and syrupy in the mouth, with very little carbonation, the palate suits the beer but still doesnt do much for me.  I can appreciate this, but it really just isnt my style.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Murky brow body topped by a large tan head
In long: What an odd beer this is, and I use the word beer in a very loose way.  Flavours were an overload of cassis, an extreme sugary sweetness, some sort of chemical/mercurochrome flavour, a light milk-chocolate tastes,  cough syrup, strong alcohol presence, extra-sweet jam and fruit flavours more reminiscent of fruits concentrate than fresh fruits.

4253,"2008-06-20",2.4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  Muddy mahogany hue.  Bursting currants over a sandy cookie dough aroma; toasty, alcoholic, and framed in an odd, dirty, vine-and-stem kind of fruit character.  Flavor is a burnt caramel and raspberry cough syrup oppressive searing sweetness.  Currant liqueur.  A sparkling, alcoholic chocolate touch tempering it lightly.  Hazelnut skin bitterness; too weak to make impact against the wash of sugar, which is monolithic in intense, rum-like, hot cane sweetness.  Full body is hot and waxy; sticky sweetness fattening up and bearing down as warmth affects it, finishing on honey, heat, and syrupy fruit, and dried out with alcohol.

Never a contemplative form of port-like digestif sweetness in this currant and caramel liquor; rather, a rushed, overripe, reckless sugar character that, when not unbearably cloying, tends to be medicinal and sharp, though alcohol never seems too bullyish.  Its just that all that sugar seems so bombastic, and seemingly for its own sake.  Thanks Mike!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

The aroma is decent enough, with melted raspberry popsicle, caramel, and chocolate.  This is very sweet, but theres also a lot of alcohol lurking in the background.  Warming reveals more raisin characteristic, like a port wine, along with some brown sugar.  The taste is a different story.  Its a really syrupy, sugary, fruity, boozy mess.  The main tastes are cherry/raspberry and brown sugar.  The alcohol that was lurking in the background of the aroma, now steps to the forefront and unleashes its sharp stinging character.

This syrupy monsters overstated cassis fruitiness, low carbonation and exceedingly sweet candied nature is simply impossible to drink with more than tiny sips. On pancakes though...

Further Personal Perceptions:
-There is no head atop the opaque brown red.
-The overwhelming cough syrup impressions got on my nerves quite quickly.
-The sweet fruitiness and candy character become akin to rosewater, somehow. Something I would not think of drinking, by the way.
-Alcohol warmth is not overdone, but there is so much caramel and candy sweetness...
-Roastiness flies by...and away. Scared, surely.

I think you could split this bottle with a friend and it would be enough for both of you. It is a wonderful brew but it can become overwhelming if you try and rush it. It reminded me more of a cordial than a beer I am glad I went with a sniffer for this one","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

4253,"2008-04-04",4.0,"12oz bottle pours deep dark amber with almost no head sustaining only just an atom thin ring. The aroma is full bold and nearly bludgeoning the olfactory senses with fresh fruit flesh from cherries, black currents and kiwi. This is certainly not some simple syrupy extract addition. I can smell this from a couple of feet away too. In fact I could smell it the next morning even though I rinsed my glass. A long draw of the aroma pulls up some hotness on the nose. The flavor begins with rich sweet cherries, black currents and a mild kiwi note. Then the flesh of the fruit is added to the flavor before the dark fruity esters, mild caramel and chocolate malts of the base beer emerge. Yum. As the finish approaches the cherry and black current sweet fruitiness return carrying a faint fruit tart sourness. Faint caramelized malts and faint sourness head deep into the after taste. Wow, great experience.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4253,"2008-04-04",3.2,"Bottle shared by B2K at Pauls. Dark brown color with some red highlights and virtually no head. Strong fruit aroma of currants and strawberries, with a big alcohol nose that when combined reminds me of cough syrup. Flavor starts off very sweet with the currants at the forefront before turning somewhat tart and finishing with a big alcoholic wallop. Really didnt taste like cough syrup, but could not get the thought out of my head that I was drinking Robitussin. I am not a big fan of currants, so it was no surprise that I really did not like this beer.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
4253,"2008-04-04",2.1,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Mostly transparent, cedar bark brown colored puor with a wispy head of off-white.  

Intense cassis nose, dripping with fruit.  Amazing, albeit a bit one-dimensional.  Juicy black currants dripping 

with fructose sugars.  Medium bodied, thinly carbonated mouthfeel.  Black currant fruit flavors appear briefly on 

the front of the palate before succumbing to a medicinal grape sudafed flavor that completely ruins the beer.  

Tons of medicinal, green Nyquil flavors.  Lots of cassis initially, but way too much syrupy medicine.  How can a

A little hot but at 16.5% I cant expect it to be much different as there isnt much age on this.  Its a drinkable sipper.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
4253,"2008-03-29",3.8,"Sampled at Tampa tasting, courtesy Degarth.  Darkish amber color, light sparse white head.

The cassis does a nice job of mellowing out the alcohol.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
4253,"2008-03-25",3.5,"Murky reddish-purple.  Big cassis with a tart, malty, slightly vinegary brown ale background.  Somewhat stiff.

4253,"2008-03-24",4.5,"Appearance: Pours a dark brown body with ruby-hued hints at the edges and encircled by a ring of off-white bubbles. Here goes nothing.

Smell: Holy moly, you can smell the black currants the second the cap is lifted from the bottle. No doubt Im in for a treat. Pure cassis, babies!

Taste: Dark malts bolstered by a strong sweetness. The flavor is dominated by the concentrated, liqueur-like black currant taste. Faint hint of roast, a touch of chocolate. A lip-licking tartness from the fruit comes out to temper the sweetness. Finishes leaving a lightly tart aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Medium carbonation. Thick, tongue-coating mouthfeel. Wonderfully warming.

Drinkability: Sporting an intense, yet refined cassis liqueur flavor, this beverage is best suited to a post-dinner sipper or instances of plotting intriques. I will always adore Kuhnhenn for brewing this beer, as well as others like their Raspberry Eisbock, Fourth Dementia, and Imperial Stout. Dont care what they churn out in the future; theyll forever have my awe because of these beers.

Slick body with a rich, sweet flavor. Lots of sweet and sticky maple, fruit preserves (cassis/grape jelly). The later flavors make it what it is, giving off a black currant richness and some dark/toasted toffee in the finish.

Aroma is berries, fruit, sweet malt, alcohol.  Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the fruit wasnt as nice as I would have liked.  The berries didnt taste nice and fresh like other fruit beers, and the alcohol and malt maybe overpowered the fruit in a displeasing way.","San Mateo, California, USA","golubj"

Maybe some black raspberry in there too.  The taste is a little medicinal for my liking, a little overbearing with the fruit and couph syrup flavors.  Big black currant and raspberry are the most noticeable flavors.  Big alcohol burn in the finish, leaves a sweet fruity aftertaste.

4253,"2008-03-15",3.7,"20080315  12oz bottle thanks to Schroppfy, shared with dmac621.  Aroma is fruity, berries, cherries, and a bit of a hint of potential lactic (milky) sourness.  Aromas continue it expand with temp into medicinal realms, cough medicine/fruit brandy.  Surprisingly, all of this is done in a tasteful, stylish way and Im not at all turned off from the thought of drinking the stuff.  First sip is shocking despite the aromatic prelude.  Wow, 16.5 percent and it tastes and feels every bit of it.  Big soft fruits up front.  Definition of jammy.  Stinks of Polish blackberry brandy, but, luckily, I love that stuff.  Long, somewhat off-putting sweetness is tenacious (go figure), tart, true to the fruit, and finishing with strong wood notes.  A strong fruit beer far from the spirit of DFH brews, yet equally well executed.  Not surprisingly, the Kuhnhenn is rated far higher than an equal beer from Milton, DE would have been.

Dark ruby color, opaque, no head. Intensive black currant aroma. Full-bodied. Liquerish black currant flavor. A bit grassy, but otherwise like drinking black currant liquer.

Tremendous fruit bouquet. Pours a really murky clouded amber-tinted mahogany. Oh my god. The flavor is revolting. Its starts with a gentle little turn in alcohol and fig sauce and then totally self-destructs. Harsh grating citrus pith moves in with a real, meaty dead yeast flavor. Coarse and gritty. Alcohols rage. Fruit dies and Im less impressed with Kuhnhenn. Cough-syrup. Esters. Bubblegum. Sweetness. Ridiculously hot. Flaming. Dry, at least, if thats saying anything at this point. Ugh.

4253,"2008-02-11",3.6,"Bottle courtesy of tetrik. Id really wanted to try this one, and I am thrilled to have had the chance. Tasted relatively fresh, Feb 08.

Pours a rich dark toffee,  very little head, lacing like liqueur.  Aroma, unsurprisingly ,is a powerful Crème de cassis, some toffee, a mild and ephemeral vomit off-note. The flavor? Black current, Crème de cassis. Sweet dark chocolate toffee. Alcohol. Lots of alcohol. The alcohol dominates the mouthfeel -- its a really hot beer, and detracts enough from the overall that Im not totally in love with this one. Definite cough-syrup elements in taste and feel. Finishes long with a nice bitter-sour currant and a faint reminder of the dark caramel sugars that it carried. 

So what to do with the second bottle? If it doesnt end up in the hands of someone else who really wants to try it, Id say it should sit until maybe 2012 to see if the alcohol can mellow and the flavors can blend. I look forward to trying it then.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

4253,"2007-12-28",4.0,"On tap @ the brewpub: Pours a murky brown color with a tan head. Aroma, currents, caramel malts, and some sweet medicinal notes. Flavor, sweet and malty, currants, alcohol, caramel, brown sugar. Very rich and thick, very sweet with a heavy fruit character. Needs to mellow. But I liked it.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
4253,"2007-12-28",4.0,"12 oz bottle from the 2007 winter solstice event.  thick pour, the color of walnut wood with a tiny ring of beige head.  lightly carbonated so the ring barely lingers.  heavy aroma of berry and blackcurrant, not to mention some overt alcohol heat.  bubblegum and cough medicine - you could make meth out of this stuff.  intense flavor - your tongue is bombarded with sugar, yeast esters, fruit, alcohol flavors, good lord. overload.  this beer will taste phenomenal in approximately 6 years, but for now its too rough and flabby.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
4253,"2007-12-27",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2009 Was able to try this at the winter solstice party.  Smelled of delicious berries.  Taste is brown sugar, caramel, an alcohol punch upfront, but it finishes with the taste of expensive and perfectly ripe dark berries.  Give this a little time and this will be really amazing.

Re-rate: had this again on tap at the brewery.  I am taking a few points off because it still hasnt lost that alcoholic punch.  However, the cassis flavor is still delicious, and overall, this is a really delicious dessert beer.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"
4253,"2007-12-24",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2008 This beer is insane. Thick, incredibly fruity (just teetering on medicinal/coughdrop), sweet but a bit stony/pitty, wet earth, iron. Impenetrable to light; turgid dark brown, very little head. Incredible sipper. Pieces of fruit abound in this beer! Small draft sample plus bottle, purchased at Winter Solstice Release.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
4253,"2007-11-18",4.1,"On tap at the 2007 GTMW: Pours a murky dark ruby mahogany with a wispy-lacing dark tan head.  Aroma of huge sweet, rich black currant juice with nice fruity esters.  Body starts full and viscous with an oily fruity texture and sweetness along with nice dark grapey black currant flavor and some sweet caramel malt toward a strong, warming bittersweet finish.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4253,"2007-10-13",4.4,"Original sample 5-12-07 from Eric, 2-3 times since. Muddy brown/reddish tint, huge beige head. Great dark fruit aroma. Really sweet grapes, plum, fig, blackberry even? Flavor has all the dark fruit, plus a realy rich caramel/toffee-ish malt backbone. Almost like syrup. Very thick/sticky cordial like mouthfeel. Very well one.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
4253,"2007-10-07",4.5,"Draft @ WBF:  incredible aroma of blackberry/current and sweet stick caramel.  the flavor was full of thick caramelized brown sugary goodness juicy berry flavors.  i couldnot stop drinking it  it was so good.  15%  is ver very well hidden.  this was the highlight of the beerfest for me.  Kuhnhenn never disapoints.","West Chester, Ohio, USA","tobias"
4253,"2007-10-06",4.1,"On draught at the World Beer Fest in Durham, NC. Last year they bring a special keg of KRE, this year, the Tenacious. The nose is very fruity with cassis and blackberry and some strong caramel malts and brown sugar. Flavor is full of casis with the old ale flavors lying underneath.  Wish I would have tried more samples of this. Im am shocked to learn this is 15%. A little alcohol is hinted on in the finish but nowhere near that much.   Probably the most interesting beer at the festival.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
4253,"2007-08-14",4.5,"GTMW, poured by Mr. Kuhnhenn. My favorite beer of the day, one that was striking in its complexity and diversity of flavors, and yet amazingly drinkable despite its high alcohol level. The nose was toffee and caramel with a hint of fruit. The palate reminded me of a blend of barleywine and Lindemanns Cassis I once concocted. The flavors of toffee harmonized with the black raspberry, currant, and dark cherry superbly, finishing with cassis liqeur. Impressive stuff.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
4253,"2007-08-13",4.4,"Tap @ GTMW. Murky and muddy chocolate in color with a few pin bubbles on the outskirts. Aroma revels in black currant, blackberries, black raspberry jam, caramelized rhubarb and baby blueberry seed amidst flavored coffee grinds. Flavor is quite a big boy. Blueberry and boysenberry chocolate bark rolls in with moderate carbonation. Cocoa rye bread meets black currant jam. Tenderly sweet abyss is laced with burnt blackberry scores bars and a singed dark chocolate character. Cocoa root pulled from the ground and fornicating with every dark fruit that comes to mind (elderberry, blackberry, black currant et al.) Full bodied and a pleasure to have on the palate, finishing with black raspberries, cocoa and rye. Remarkable.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4253,"2007-08-13",4.0,"On tap at the GTMW
The pour is a lighter brown with some red and purple hightlights, and a thick tan head.  Big fruity aroms at really dripped with currents and cara malts.  Ive never really tasted anything quite like this before.  Juicey berries and caramel and even a touch of hops maybe?  Is this from a barrel.  I cant really tell, but there something else.  This was a nice find for me.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
4253,"2007-08-05",3.8,"Bottle sample at MBGF07. Poured hazy reddish brown with an average fizzy off-white head that lasted with good lacing. Heavy sweet tart fruity aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Heavy sweet fruity balanced flavor and a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Good after dinner with a cigar brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4253,"2007-08-05",4.2,"MiBGF 07: Poured from a 2007 barrel aged jeroboam bottle by Brett, thanks! Deep purple and brown hued with a lasting frothy tan head. The nose detected a lovely black current (Cassis) vapours along with essence of tobacco, fig, rich taffy, wood, and tea leaves. OUTSTANDING!  The taste starts with massive sweet fruits and caramel malt over a layer of spicy stuff. The finish has notes of oxidation, earthy and woody notes. This is a tad syrupy and lush but makes it more like an liquor than beer. There is a bit of alcohol also noted towards the end.  A true sipping brew much like the Raspberry Eisbock. OH SO YUMMY, I LOVE IT! My 2nd favorite beer at the fest.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
4253,"2007-07-29",3.7,"Bottle:  The aroma is sweet with notes of grape bubblegum and strawberry candy.  Suprisingly, very little alcohol is noticeable in the nose.  Its a barely transparent orangish-brown with a small beige head.  Lots of sweet grape upfront, somewhat candy-ish.  The finish has somewhat of a cough syrup flavor with some mild alcohol.  Full bodied with a sticky mouthfeel and mild carbonation.  I sampled this with Styles, artusory, luntaticharness, and punkrkr27 courtesy of the Kuhnhenn Bros. and it was much better then.  Im told this will be bottled, so Im anxiously awaiting a re-rate.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
4253,"2007-06-11",4.0,"Sample provided by Eric Kuhnhenn. Muddy dark brown body with a large beige head, lasting, nice lace. The aroma is toffee, prunes, figs and berries. The flavor is toffee, molases, currants and figs. Full body is soft and sticky with light carbonation and a warm finish.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
4253,"2007-05-21",4.1,"On tap at World Beer Expo, Frankenmuth, MI!!   Pleasantly surprised to find this offering at the fest.   Magnum bottle sitting at the Kuhnhenn table said 2007.   Pours dark coppery-amber color with a quickly diminishing tan head.   Aroma is huge caramel malts, red and black berries, alcohol, dried cherries.   Flavor is caramel, toffee, dried cherries, molasses, prune, blackberry, and a kick of alcohol.   Palate is full bodied, mildly carbonated, finished on the sweet side, thick and syrupy.   Great stuff.  Very typical Kuhnhenn high gravity stuff, I mean that in a good way for sure!    Hope to find this again someday.","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"
