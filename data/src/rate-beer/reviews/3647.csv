Opened at close to room temperature and poured into a couple of whiskey glasses. Body is black and oily, with a thin slick of tan head.

3647,"2014-12-04",4.3,"330 ml bottle into snifter; bottle #26077, bottled in 8/2010. Pours fairly pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, vanilla, oak, raisin, plum, fig, peat smoke, leather, tobacco, and oak/peat earthiness. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and whiskey cask notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, vanilla, oak, raisin, plum, fig, peat smoke, leather, tobacco, and roast/peat earthiness. Slight roast/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, vanilla, toffee, oak, dark fruit, peat smoke, leather, tobacco, and oak/peat earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and whiskey cask flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding old ale! All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malts and whiskey cask flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV.

3647,"2012-11-13",3.5,"Tasted @ Grain Cru - Roll Out the Barrels, Belgian Beer Café.Produced up an oily yet thinly looking, tawny brown, headless bar a tan ring on the meniscus and almost still. Aside a hint of Bovril and molasses there is bountiful oak and whisky notes on the nose with licks of molasses, stonefruit and charred wood. Dominated by the heated, spiced whisky and oak of the barrel aging it is reasonably mellowing in the mouth even for its modest alcohol content. Body is light, oily and a little awkward being its only downfall. Plenty of vanilla and vinous tannins present with a fatty, lipid note similar to the 12YO. Peat and smoke, ash and a strange meaty note of Biltong linger amongst the oak long between sips. Very much a fire-side, slow-sipper thats rather pleasant to drink.

3647,"2012-05-26",3.1,"Poured into a snifter. Bottle #55737, bottled January 2009. I looked up how much the 30 year whiskey costs and the cheapest was just north of $300. The 40 year is just a fraction more at over $1,200 per bottle. And to think I thought this bottle of beer was expensive at $16.99.

3.0 A: Black color. Just about a finger of frothy light brown head. Retention is subpar and one lone, patch of lacing is left.

4.0 S: The 30 year Ola Dubh I had recently was from 07. Im glad this one is from 09. The whiskey is more powerful. The base beer itself offers little aside from a roastiness and a bit of chocolate. The whiskey is where its at. The 40 year is decidedly more earthy and ""wild"" than the 30 year. Mountain stream, ash, peat, mineral. Theres also light amounts of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and oak. Really well integrated, but I think I liked the nose on the 30 a bit better. Still, this Highland Park stuff seems legit.

3.5 T: The base is again MIA save for some roastiness. The whiskey tastes like it smells, but could use a bit of power. Fresh running forest stream, ash, peat, mineral again. Coffee and chocolate gain some strength while the vanilla and oak stay in the shadows. Easily the most earthy whiskey Ive experienced (most of which have been through beer). While this is tasty, both the base beer and the whiskey need some more strength for this to break past a 3.5.

2.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Carbonation is a touch lower than what Id like. Missing all creaminess for the most part.

3.0 D: Normally Id give this a 3.5 out of general good will, but I cant since this is so goddamn expensive. Its not a bad beer, but it has plenty of flaws and the mouthfeel sucks.

Beautiful looking dark beer; solid burnt tan head stands firm atop a opaque mahogany body.
Complex aroma of bitter chocolate, whisky, pear, raisin, tar, prune, coffee and spice.
Carbonation quite low, thick oily texture with a drying astringent woody character cutting through.
Flavour is just so immensely complex - burnt nuts, cocoa, cola, prune, raisin, vanilla, clove, pear, bitter orange marmalade, coffee bean. Booze is totally undetected, finishes with a slight oaky astrigency and high hop bitterness, cutting through the richness.
Just the complexity of this beer just makes me wanna try the Scotch from which it was borne, but they made not be feasible. Fantastic really, certainly a treat that I didnt think id ever have, and will definately work my way backwards through the range.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
3647,"2011-11-28",4.1,"Is the 30 or the 40yr better? The only way to answer that is to open both and go head to head. Black pour, not oily. The light brown head in this glass mystified me until I realized that the Corsendonk glass Im using is etched on the bottom. The hint was the little fizzing black hole in the center of the surface. Nose: the difference? +1 to the 30 - the more nutty, creamy, chocolate goodness in the 30 vs. the dirtier slightly smoky whisky notes of the 40. More 30 aroma: amazing aroma, very tantalizing indeed - chocolate, deep non-sweet roast, biscuit, softer whisky notes that do include some of that Highland smoke, almonds and a bouquet of flowers with notable chrysanthemums - no crazy depth but just soothing. More 40 aroma: cherry medicinal thing, dirty oaky ashy earthy yy, apple bread, spices, I mainly find the cherry thing after letting the glass sit as once that great cloud of smells gets busted up it goes into hiding. Apricot, fresh tobacco. What tastes better? The 40 with ease - not to say anything bad about the 30 - both are excellent but the 40 is meaner and has depth. 40 flavours: Ashes, sweet plum, dirt, very dark melted chocolate, very very light alcohol goodness gives a kick, oak, rough vanilla, tobacco, light mineral flavour, something else. Ok, Vertical Limit is on. I LOVE this movie! As a climber I respect this movie. Ok, I surrendered part of my soul for that comment but its so fucking awful that I always have to watch. Lots of whisky in that 40... 30 flavours: ohoh! something is wrong with the chopper!!!!! How are they possibly going to get out of this alive? Smooth roasted malts with a short lived sweetness, chocolate, nuts, vanilla, light peppery spice of scotch, candy, dry dirt, toffee, goodness. Easy drinking. Both are a bit oily and fully bodied, etc etc. I have to give the nod to the 40 even though usually the aroma wins out for me. Excellent beers.

Aroma shows a lot of influence from the whisky barrels but this is integrated very well and doesnt overpower the other elements; tar, smoke, seaweed, whisky and vanilla mix beautifully with notes of dark chocolate, liquorice and dark fruit. Flavour has many of the same characteristics as the aroma but is woodier, less smokey, roastier, sweeter and less salty. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with soft carbonation and a long roasty finish.

In the mouth, velvety whisky notes dominate, along with hints of coffee, burnt toast, wood and smoke. The whisky makes a lot of itself, throughout the palate and into the aftertaste and there is less of the licorice tones apparent in the younger casked versions. That is OK by me - this is the kind of whisky that should be allowed a fair level of assertiveness. Even in a beer.

3647,"2011-05-17",3.8,"330 ml bottle from LCBO, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. Bottle 40098, JAN 2009. 
App.:  Deep brown black with a thin mocha head.
  
Aroma:  Strong rich chocolate and coffee notes, plenty of inky, iodine, brine peaty smoke, a bit of fruitiness in there somewhere, honey?, lots of molasses, dark dried fruits, more smoke, a bit ashen, a touch spicy with some orange-citrus notes.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, restrained effervescence, good mouth-coating, a touch powdery.
  
Flav.:  A big hit of molasses, some chocolate and coffee, licorice, the malts are a little more assertive and push back the smoke and whiskey somewhat, still a fair bit of these, honey, vague fruitiness, some figs and raisins, the brine/iodine nature of the peat comes through later, pretty good; sweet with sufficient bitterness and a fairly long, chocolate/cocoa and light smoke/metallic finish. 

Well, thats the whole series.  Ive reviewed my notes for all ages and dont find any kind of trend or progression.  They are all good and interesting in their own ways.  This was tasty.

Fairly strong smokiness and wood start off the first sip, which are then followed by prune, milk and dark chocolate, dark molasses and whisky.  Leaves a light smokiness and bitter chocolate behind in the aftertaste.

Served in a tulip glass. Pours black with no head or lacing. Nice pitch black color. The nose is really complex and intriguing with whiskey, oak, light vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is a bit overly boozy but still quite nice with a lot of whisky and chocolate. The booze fits well in the feel as its interspersed throughout and finishes nicely. Drinks well; nice sipper.

There are also coffee, some smoke and roasted malts and a sweetness that reminds me a little of marzipan. The mouthfeel is medium andsmooth withe a mild oily texture and a finish that are sweet and round. Again the taste is packed with impressions from the whisky casks - you sense them taste them and gets much the same feeling in the the throat and inner nose as when sipping whisky.

The aroma is where this beer really shines, its probably really the only thing that separates it from the  others, its so complex I cant do it justice, you really just gotta smell this stuff, theres the expected notes of whiskey, but it seems as if its more of a islay style single malt rather than a highland, very peaty and smokey, notes of oak, and earth, caramel, toffee malts, anise, and an almost menthol note, not sure what to peg that as, really fantastic nose. The flavour is good, but at the same time is what lets me down, its good, not amazing, not oh sweet baby jesus thank you for this amazing gift to my palate, for 20 bucks, this stuff shouldnt just smell amazing, it should taste amazing too, and it doesnt, it just tastes good, very good, not amazing.

Bottle #54338 of January 2009


There is no moon tonight as pure darkness slowly fills my snifter, drowning out all light and igniting flames of passion in my heart. Her thin espresso head immediately dissipates to make way for a nose as powerful and imposing as a monsoon in season. Before dipping my nose into her black depths, I tease her I imposing depths and revel in wonder at the tears she leaves behind. Tears, my fellow beer geeks and whisky freaks, tears. Amen, hallelujah, and peanut butter. Whereas the 30yr dabbled semi-resolutely in Highland Park esters, the 40yr is all about 40 year old Highland Park single-malt scotch. Oh yes, I am exactly where I want to be right now. Char, peat, tar, spice, black root and scotch seduce me like few others have to date. Burnt marshmallow, caramel, and espresso crema wash over bright red apple skins before I fall once more to the riches of earth with scotch-soaked wood and black soil. Leather is polished to shining while the peppery spice of rich cigar leaf fills my nostrils. Take one Harvieston Ola Dubh 40yr, one fine long-leaf cigar, add an hour or two of blissful nothingness to your day, and voila: nirvana. Fudge brownies ooey-gooey and warm to the touch emerge from the oven topped with vanilla and I am off to the supping races where slow and easy does it. Wow! Exquisite! Creamy, smooth, and warm; the warmth subtly imbues itself throughout the entirety of her palate and, likewise, my body. Caramel cream and espresso crema exude burnt sweetness parleyed by burnt bitterness. A touch dry in the middle, spicy warmth tickles the back of my throat. Red apple and red plum skins provide tart bitterness in the middle while their unripe meats are absorbed by old wood soaked in scotch for, imagine that, 40 years. Cigar leaf and leather weave in and out of the woody warmth of her scotch origins. There is little up front and little in the back except for a pleasant glow in my chest; all that my Ola Dubh 40yr has to say is square in the middle of her palate. For all her bigness, she is exceptionally quaffable and the more she warms, the more dark fudge and gooey brownies work their way into my heart. Each quaff coats my lips in leathery oils and caramel, and I decide it is nigh time to set the pen down and simply enjoy.

The direct but pleasant whisky flavors practically dominate the beer. In the background there is an echo of black licorice, seaweed,smoke, star anise, Chinese preserved plum, and salty soy sauce. The lingering aftertaste represents the rich whisky malt and its vanilla-tinged spicy wood. The chocolate malts assert themselves late, still yielding to the Highland Park.

Poured on my Ayinger Celebrator Bock glass. 

Jet black, not as viscous as I expected it to be. Moderate tan head. No light seems to get through it. 

The whisky barrels do such a good job on this beer. The smell is of sweet malty whisky in my opinion. Not overpowering, its actually a great combination. Im thinking of wooden dark chocolate. The more I smell, the more I like it. Hmmm Makes me want to get a steak burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. Cooked over oak. 

When I have it in my mouth I feel the whisky aroma flow from my mouth to my nose, just like when you hold Scotch in your mouth.

Taste some very toasty mature oak which is buttery with caramel and coconut, the base beer very solid but really just showcasing the fine and subtle whiskey qualities. Has something of a drying finish, with a bit of acidity and lactic feel. A mixed success, really not worth a gigantic effort to get,  but definitely worth a try.

3647,"2010-05-20",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This excellent Barrel-Aged Old Ale superposes whisky notes to dark chocolate and dried fruit, all in an elegantly slender mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the brown-edged darkness.
-The aroma is dominated by the whisky barrel. It is still enjoyable, but the 30-year-old version had a more complex aroma.
-The nicely peated flavors are levelled with that of the base Old Ale.
-The malt profile and calculated esters make for a beautiful cake.
-Spiciness and alcohol appear discreetly in the background.
-I love the fact that this big brew is not very sweet at all and rather presents its complex flavor profile with restraint. Very classy.

Head retention is good, but not much lacing.  The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, smoke, peat, iodine, oak, and vanilla.  The Scotch Whisky aromas are pretty strong in this brew!  The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, its all Scotch and malt.  And as far as Im concerned, thats a good thing.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has low/moderate carbonation and its a little bit coating although it does seem a bit thin at times.  Drinkability is very good, its smooth and pretty easy to drink.  Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, but then I like malty beers and Scotch.  That and I liked the other Ola Dubh beers Ive tried.

3647,"2009-12-24",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2009 330mL bottle, as a gift from the very generous Derweg/Belgian/Jonas (thanks again man!). I would never have got this otherwise, as the LCBO figured it was entirely okay to bring in pathetically limited quantities, without a hope in hell of ever getting it out of Toronto (although due to some convenient administrative f*** ups it did anyways). But I digress. Served at room temp on Christmas Eve, by the tree. Pours an opaque dark brown with a tiny tan head. The aroma is just stunning. So much oak and scotch its extremely impressive. Same chocolate and malts as the 12 but theyre over-powered by the woody aspects which impress me so much more. The flavour is quite sweet, again same malty aspects as the 12, but in this case I actually dont enjoy them as much. Im much more into the oaky aspects, which is odd as I usually am not a fan of barrel aging. Booze is slightly hot but not cloying like the sweetness is bordering on.

3647,"2009-06-30",4.0,"On tap at Maxs rare beer night part 2. Man, $3 for 5 oz. what a deal. Very similar to the 30 but still awesome. Sweet, barrel, bourbon and whiskey notes, vanilla. So nice and smooth. Mellow roast and very flavorful and sweet and drinkable.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
3647,"2009-06-30",4.0,"Expensive little 12 oz at $20.50. Bottle number 56319. Pours with a tan head over a very dark brown near black body. Aroma is awesome with tons of Scotch, peat, soaked wooden notes, brown sugar, smoke and beef jerky. Taste is minerally with chocolate, peat, smoke, dryness, burnt caramel, and low residual sugars. Creamy carbonation and mouthfeel. Technically excellent, but I dont think I will be buying it again. Wish it had more residual sugars.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3647,"2009-06-28",4.0,"Bottled, Beer Hunters (#41366, Jan 2009). 
Opaque black/brown color, small brown head. Very similar aroma than in Ola Dubh 30: licorice, oak and vanilla - slightly more vanilla than in Ola Dubh 30. Medium to full bodied - more robust than Dubh 30. Soft palate, whicky, licorice, oak-wood, sweetish vanilla. Balanced and highly drinkable barrel aged beer.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"
3647,"2009-06-26",4.3,"Cask - Maxs.  Dark brown, fizzy light tan head.  Complex oaked scotch and earthed vanilla aromas warm to swirls of roasty smoked chocolate and hints of licorice.  Deep flavors of peat smoke and booze are well structured over an earthy caramel backbone.  Rounds well with just a hint of toasty molasses and smoked peppery heat in the finish.  Light to medium bodied with cask-like carbonation (obviously).  A gem this one is","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
3647,"2009-06-26",4.2,"Cask at Maxs in Baltimore: Pours an oily nearly opaque with a small, creamy beige head.  Aroma of rich, earthy smoky peat and some toasty dark caramel malts.  Starts with good fullness and lightly creamy texture along with some toasty caramel sweetness and smooth, well-balanced smoky peat before a slightly drier, smoky sweet finish.  A very nicely aged Scotch ale.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3647,"2009-06-21",4.0,"Shared at Kuhnhenn Summer Solstice.  Pours dark brown, almost black with thin tan head.  Aroma is booze, whiskey, oak, roasted malt, and chocolate.  Taste is molasses, chocolate, whiskey, oak.  Medium mouthfeel, finishes hot alcohol.   Pretty good!","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","mattmc1973"
3647,"2009-06-07",4.0,"OMG  pours dark with a creamy head muddy in texture.on draft at a beer show in Chicago pours like motor oil almost more of a stout very smooth the only time the ABV came through was near the finish. Taste of smoke, licorice, raisin, vanilla. strong aroma of roasted malts toffee, molasses, caramel. World class stuff at least on draft. I only had a small sample of this brew. I re-rated this as I had it confused with the 12 year which I have tried since.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","dutch23mp"

3647,"2009-02-21",3.9,"On cask at the Brick Store.

Arrives ink black in the glass with only a few bubbles around the top, all of which recede quickly to nothing and leave no lacing.

The aroma is big on this one and dominated by the scotch barrels.  There are some sweet malts in the background.

The taste is a little different as the sweet chocolate malts come out more as well as some dark fruits.  The scotch is present but not as dominate as the nose and the taste, overall, is like a scotch-soaked chocolate dessert.

The mouthfeel is very slick and smooth with almost no carbonation and plenty of barrel presence.

I really enjoyed this one, especially the taste which was very well balanced given the barrel aging.  Very tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
3647,"2009-02-19",3.8,"On cask at the Brickstore. Very smooth drink. The aroma is where you really notice the oak aging with some wood and a bit of whiskey in there. The flavor is whiskey alcohol up front and a bit of espresso coffee malt flavor and coffee bitterness. Next up is a touch of vanilla and the finish is earthy and peat. All of that leads to a pretty diverse but incredibly subtle drink. You better pay attention when you drink this one or else you are going to miss some of its character.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
3647,"2009-01-31",3.7,"Cask at Rattle -N- Hum.  Pitch black beer.  Aroma is lightly sweet and a bit toasty.  Fairly prominent molasses and black licorice notes with just a kiss of salty brine and oak.  Fairly chewy flavour with a little bit of caramel and soft smokiness.  Rich lingering dark malt sweetness and a hint of char and cocoa.  Its fairly hot and peppery, but it is pretty enjoyable.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3647,"2009-01-28",3.6,"Cask at RattlenHum. The aroma has coconut, vanilla, bourbon. Feels overloaded with scents but is almost too much. Sweet, tar flavors are present, with some prune. A bit of vanilla as well, but comes across fairly mild in flavor for its strength, especially considering the kick in the face aroma. Not very exciting. Fairly typical BBA stout (or Old Ale, if you will, but its awfully close to a ton of American BBA stouts).","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3647,"2009-01-17",3.9,"Cask. Pours an smooth, opaque black with no head at all. Nose is chocolate, smooth, a hint of peaty acidity, and a very subtle, mellow roasty underpinning. Taste is rich and so mellow - smooth milk chocolate notes, with a tiny bite of acidity, a very subtle peaty smoke note, and an earthy, organic finish. Very unique beer. Mouthfeel is smooth, but with that round, gentle fluffiness that comes from well conditioned cask. Superb.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"
