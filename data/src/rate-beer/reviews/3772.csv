3772,"2012-02-27",4.0,"Klásterní Pivovar Strahov, Prága (Im not sure about the original czech name of this seasonal beer). Az egyik kedvenc helyem Prágában, zseniálisak. Idén Januárban egy szűretlen barna búzasörrel örvendeztettek meg. Felhős, átláthatatlan narancsbarna színe van és jókora kitartó, krémes-kemény piszkosfehér, bézshez közelítő habja. Illata enyhén pörkölt búzamalátás, banános, halványan csokis és élesztősen száraz. Ízében is a banán, a búzamalátás-rozskenyeres íz, csokis keksz, tej és élesztő finom együttese található meg. Nagyon lágy és mégis tartalmas, összetett ízvilággal rendelkező, egészen testes búzasör. Illik a téli hideghez, de bármikor elfogadnám!","Budapest, HUNGARY","mattphilips"
3772,"2012-02-14",3.9,"bottle via Cuso in trade...hooray!  Deep dark brown. Single finger beige head.  Steady carbonation. Strong spicy nose with light whispy bananna esters.  Strong baseline of the wonderful wheat yeast strain I enjoyed so much at the brewwery a number of years ago.  Body is light to moderate and does not linger.  Finish is abrubt.  Slippers on and relaxing in the barko lounge chair.  If there was a bit mopre body it would be glorious.","Hippetown East, New York, USA","coldbrewky"
