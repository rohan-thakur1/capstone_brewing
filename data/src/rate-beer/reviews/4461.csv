4461,"2017-04-10",4.0,"Sample @ CBC Boston, 2016. Thick, vividly electric purple pour with a massive light purple head that eventually settles. Smells and drinks like a blueberry milkshake. Sweet and just a bit tart. Extremely juicy. Some earthy, acidic fruit skin. Full bodied, approaching thick. Interesting stuff that sort of drives the idea of a fruit beer to the extreme. Fun to try.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

Aroma is intensely blueberry forward with strong winey notes (probably just because of the blueberries), some funk hidden behind the fruits and mild lemony presence.
