Un goût, encore-là, très léger, de pétale de pivoine. Peut-être, en fait sûrement, de riz refroidi. Quelque chose de transformé, aussi du miel commercial, celui qui est fait à partir de deux sortes provenant de pays différents. (716-290613)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"

254,"2012-10-02",3.0,"Bottle. Clear pale colourless. Nose is quite fruity. As cold almost like a sweet pear cider. Or some sort of fruit candy, feels almost artificial the fruity floral/perfumy nose. Below that a rice backing. Body is a bit light, with the fruityness making it feel almost sweet. A dusty-dry finish. Sort of nice. Easily drunk.","FINLAND","jookos"

254,"2010-07-09",3.5,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a extremely small sized head of frothy large sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a very softly carbonated slightly hazy clear colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was rice polished rice alcohol and sweet. The semi-thick mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start mediumly tingly at the finish with a mellow vinous aftertaste. The semi-thick creamy flavor contained notes of polished rice rice mildly vinous and alcohol. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
254,"2010-05-24",2.8,"Honey butter aroma, volatile. Clear yellowish hue. Honey and vodka, some floral note detected. Alcohol very evident. Id say this was a good ginjo, but I think it is more a matter of my appreciation for sake is beginning to develop.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

Appearance: plain ,  still clear white  .        Nose: soft , aromatic with hint of soft perfumed rice. Touch of dry alcohol beneath.    Flavor/Palate :  mid light bodied. Dry alcoholic wrap on soft smooth aromatic body. Subtle fruity character.  Pleasant softness does not pair that well with its alcohol strength. Late long lasting burn of vodka.Beyond that this one was quiet nice to have. This sake could be very much drinkable at lower strengths.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"

Goût de menthe poivré, sel et une légère touche de réglisse noir. Lalcool est présente mais je ne goûte pas le 14.5% plutôt 10% très léger... Une sensation claire et limpide avec une finition légèrement âcre et salé finissant sur le sucré de la réglisse.

This one is similar in taste when its warm and when its cold but it is watery when its warm. This is a unique sake that is light overall.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"

254,"2006-08-11",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2007 The bottle I had was a frosted sky blue color. Pours totally clear. The bouquet is very much like that of Pinot Grigio. The flavors are semi sweet, clean and crisp with bright candy fruit flavors. This totally drinks like a high end Pinot Grigio. Finishes long and very fruity.

Coating, but not thick palate. Semi-lingering taste. Very fresh smooth flavor, with hints of banana and slightly dry and grassy. Not an expert sake rater, but this was delicious. Could have possibly been a bit more complex, or maybe I wasnt trying. Either way, I liked it.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
