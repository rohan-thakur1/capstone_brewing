696,"2012-11-21",4.3,"Enjoyed several helps of this at FOBAB. Served in my FOBAB taster glass. 

A: Pours a dark brown color with a tan head forming on the pour. Nice retention and it recedes slowly down the glass. 

S: Pappy up front, sweet for sure, with a nice barrel presence. Some oak, vanilla and caramel. There is a nice wee heavy base there with a little peat and roasted malts. 

M: The taste jumps up to another level entirely. The Pappy is up first. Incredibly smooth with the barrel and base beer mixing wonderfully after that. Smokey with a nice roasted malt presence. The barrel weaves in and out with some vanilla and toffee that lend a hand to the semi-sweet and peaty finish. 

M: Medium low carbonation with a medium-heavy mouthful. Full of flavor it rolls over the palate with a smooth and creamy finish. 

O: Wow. This beer blew me away and might have been the best thing I had at FOBAB. The base beer still shines through and the Pappy barrel gives this beer another complex layer of flavor. I really want to try this again.

I normally dont rate anything at a festival, but since I had about 6 tastes of this during the weekend, I feel like I got a good sampling before my palate was toast.  Pours cola brown.  Aroma is tons of sweetness and bourbon.  Taste is typical of a scotch ale with some smokiness and peat and lots of mellow bourbon flavor.  I loved this one...one of the best beers at the festival.","Alpine, California, USA","hamilton23"

696,"2011-11-17",3.2,"On tap (FoBAB 2011) : The aroma consists of chocolate, caramel, moderate coconut, vanilla cake/icing, and light alcohol.  Its a dark copper that shows transparency when held to the light,  It has a large beige head that leaves behind some spotty lacing.  The flavor starts with caramel and has a pretty strong vanilla cake/icing component.  The finish has mild bourbon, coconut, and light alcohol.  Its light-medium bodied with mild carbonation and a slightly thin mouthfeel.  Overall, its not bad, but the vanilla icing flavor quickly wears on me.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
696,"2011-11-14",3.8,"Sampled on tap at FoBAB 2011 (Chicago, IL). Pours a murky brownish pour with a hazy frothy tannish head that films and laces small. Aromas are red fruit, touches of peat, and caramel and toffee, vanilla, a nice dose of Bourbon, vanilla tannins, oak, and gentle spice. Initial is Bourbon and oak mixing with sweeter thicker malts, toffee and caramel, roast and toasty biscuits, some gentle dark fruit, vanilla. Backend throws some gentle heat and linger sweet sticky qualities. I personally enjoyed the coffee T-Bone version a bit more, as the coffee helped lower the smack into the finish. This was still quite enjoyable, flavorful barrel.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
696,"2011-11-14",4.4,"Hey, guess what... this beer was one iof my most favorite at FoBaB 2011. The aorma of this beer was dense with flavor. A very medium sweetness to this beer, PVM totally suprised me with the amount of caramel, chocolate, coffee, and coconut flavors in this brew. I felt like I was on an island half the time. I tried so many  beers that night, but I kept coming back to this one as one of my favs.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","justinwmaynard"
