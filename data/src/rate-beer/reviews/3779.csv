Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice weizen bock style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV.

3779,"2014-11-21",3.0,"22 oz bottle, poured into a tulip glass as room temperature.

A: Pours a deep orange-copper, with some mild cloudiness, and forms a three-finger pale orange head that collapses rather quickly into a cap and ring.

S: Caramel and toffee malt notes dominate the opening of the aroma, and are quickly joined by what seems like pine sap. Some fruit notes also appear, like overripe pear and raisin, and perhaps a vaguely banana-bready tinge.

T: Thats an interesting approach to a weizenbock. The piney scent from the aroma carries forward into the beer, giving the whole flavor profile a wallop that is tough for me to get past, and highlighting the alcohol heat thats along. However, beneath that, theres a parade of fruit esters - cherries, overripe pear, raisins, and tart apple. Further beneath that lurks the shades of banana bread with toffee replacing the nuts, alongside clove and coriander spices. The finish is pure alcohol burn, perhaps with some of that pine-ness along.

M: Creamy, full, and sticky, with high carbonation that carries a sharp tang with it, and plenty of alcohol heat - this does not hide its ABV at all.

O: Im torn here. While the flavor profile offers significant complexity, it also heavily features a two-note barrage of pine and alcohol, to me. While the mouthfeel is exactly what one wants out of a weizenbock in consistency, the carbonation and heat are a bit excessive. I imagine for those who are less hop-sensitive than I am, this is an outright good beer. I am left wondering if I would repeat it given the opportunity.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"
3779,"2014-11-17",3.9,"On the side, the best by date says ""06/17/15.""
This was poured into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a hazy dark brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that settled within about a minute. Light lacing conclaved around the sides of the glass.
The smell started off with a caramelized / bready spice. As it warmed, it seemed that the spice leaned towards the clove side.
The taste had a sticky sweet bready caramel connotation sliding across my tongue. Super sticky sweet caramel aftertaste.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. Sweet bready caramel malt moves finely across my tongue.
Overall, as a weizenbock, I didnt get as much of the wheatiness as I expected. For me, I still liked it and still would bang it again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3779,"2014-10-09",4.0,"22 ounce bottle, label says best before 06/17/15. Served in a mug, the beer pours a burnt orange color with about a half inch light tan creamy head. The head stays around a while, and theres a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like cloves, banana, bubblegum, caramel, and some candied oranges. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also bready malt and a sweet spiciness noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and coating with moderate carbonation.

Taste that follows is smooth and actually hides the alcohol relatively well. Lots of spice (probably cloves) comes into play and finish is reminiscent of standard doppel bocks.

Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is cloudy dark amber.

Aroma is moderately malty (caramel), with notes of banana, clove, toffee, apple, raisin, alcohol.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy/velvety texture, lively/soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Sure seems like Weizenbock to me, has a big banana-clove Weissbier nose, which straight doppelbocks dont really have. Regardless, it smells nice. Fairly sweet in the mouth, and a little sticky-syrupy, but its not thick and goopy, so its still reasonably drinkable. Pretty good if not great.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

This probably should have been entered, by the brewery as a  Weizenbock. It is in other words an experiment.
