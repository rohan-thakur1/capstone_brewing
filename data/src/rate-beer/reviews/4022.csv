4022,"2016-07-19",3.8,"From notes. Enjoyed this at a tasting at Andrews house for my first tasting with the Ann Arbor crew on July 8! 750 mL bottle. The pour is a cloudy golden yellow with a big frothy white head that falls down to a dense cap, leaving a great lace behind. There is a light dankness to it, and a really good hop. The tropical fruits are nice and balanced. This isnt really what I had in mind for a Trillium IPA, but its pretty good. The flavor matches pretty well. Light dank hop, bright citrus, some tropical fruit; not too bad. The mouth feel is a little thicker than some of the others. There is a nice carbonation and the aftertaste is lingeringly juicy and fruity. There is a dankness to it that just lingers and lingers. This is a pretty good beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4022,"2016-06-16",4.2,"32oz growler filled 6/3/16, drunk 6/9/16.Moderately-to-heavily hazy, pale, flaxen-gold with light brass tints and a large, white, well-retained head atop.Grassy, for sure, moreso than most Trilliums, and at first I think that may be to some detriment, as the biscuity/crackery malts rise up and add plentiful ""dryness"" to the nose, as well. But slowly, stone fruit, white grape, meyer lemon and juicy orange/tangerine assert themselves. After more warming and breathing, the stuff just gets better and better as the nose (and flavor) continues to achieve more juicy depth, complexity and balance. No alcohol or flaw.Again in the mouth, it begins very, very dry, grassy, lightly grainy and with lots of unripened nectarine, lemon zest and light floral notes. But as it warms, the malts soften all of these dry notes, while the nelson morphs in to nectarine and white grape, quite juicy, and made even more so by the spicy orange juice notes imparted by the galaxy. Tight carbonation, no flaw, no resin, moderate bitterness and incredibly drinkable. The Small Bird Series can do no wrong, it seems!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
