2975,"2015-08-25",1.0,"Bottle @ Aarons Wedding Eve Shindig. Thanks, Sean. Dark brownish colored beer with no foam. Smells like burnt teriyaki chicken. Oxidized, smokey, and sugary. A whole ton of brown sugar and maple syrup. A lot of charcoal and ashy flavors along with soap and a cloying sweetness. Meaty, salty, and sugary. Yum a dum dum. Probably deserves an adnielsen ""fuck you"".","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2975,"2015-08-24",0.6,"Holy hell. If you are waiting for a beer that combines everything bad about malt liquor with everything bad about cheap Scotch, wait no more. This is a truly horrendous beverage w/ no redeeming quality aside from novelty value. It is smokey, ashy, soy sauce tasting crapola which is too sickly sweet to even be vaguely drinkable, esp. considering the punishingly high alcohol content. In short, I recommend everyone try this immediately.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2975,"2015-08-21",3.2,"Bottle, thanks to homer321 for sharing this super whale at my pre-wedding gathering. Somewhat cloudy dark brown appearance with a thin brown head. Some swamp / peaty notes in the nose along with chocolate and roast. Body is a little oily. Fairly boozy. Nice scotch whiskey taste along with plenty of sweet notes like caramel, chocolate, and coconut. Not fucken bad.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
2975,"2015-08-07",2.3,"Nose is super smokey, peaty, oxidized. Light soy sauce. Not the most inviting. Brown in color with a layer of alcohol on top. Taste is like a super sweet soy sauce and smokey scotch. Some alcohol warming. Well. This has been interesting. Thanks Patrick!","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
2975,"2015-08-07",2.7,"Hand Bottle at Aarons Pre-Wedding Bash. Pour is deep brown with no head - decent legs. Huge soy sauce, caramel, brown sugar, bread, and grapes in the aroma. Taste is tangy, soy sauce, leather, dark fruits, bread, and licorice. Slick mouthfeel with no carbonation. Oh Dear God.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
2975,"2015-07-11",3.9,"Bouteille 750ml. Couleur ambrée translucide, absence de mousse. Arôme de malt caramélisé, tourbé, boisé, alcool. Goût de malt caramélisé, caramel, fumée, café en arrière-goût. Carbonatation absente, corps moyen-dense, collante.","Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Whatup14"
2975,"2015-06-29",3.6,"Growler - Toffee and peat with some light toasty notes. Clear copper with no head. Sweet, woody with some nice peat and syrupy notes. A odd but nice beer for sure. Would be great after dinner as a whisky replacement.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2975,"2015-06-15",3.5,"sample from slovaksniper, thanks dude! unclear light brown orange pour, no bubbles, dead flat. dark burnt caramel, rock sugars, lots of dark roasted/charred wood, touch of peat and saline components, dried fruits - prunes, dates et al.; coconut and vanilla, salt, clean. flat carbonation, medium-full body; boozy, astringently woody and sweet but never cloying buttery caramel-mineral-spicy finish. BA barleywine-ish. wood treatment - with its peaty islay features - complements this boozy licka/sipper. nice.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2975,"2015-06-07",3.5,"Un malt liquor près du barley wine avec des notes maltées intenses, du caramel, une touche de whiskey, du bois. La bouche est agréable, piquante par son alcool. Pas si mal.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
2975,"2015-06-05",3.3,"Brun ambré. Arômes légers de fumée de tourbe et très riches en raisins secs et en bonbons maltés. Les saveurs sont réconfortantes, sucrées à souhait et minimalement touchées par le traitement du fût. La bouche presque morte ou morte est liquoreuse. La finale est toute en alcool. Intéressant.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2975,"2015-06-05",3.5,"Sample from bottle, thanks Pat! 

Appearance: Deep amber-mahogany, no head and little alcocol/sugar legs. 

Aroma: A burst of dried fruits (figs, raisins, dates) along candi sugar, peat, alcohol, caramel and toasted malts. 

Taste: Boozy with quite a lot of residual sugars, figs, raisins, peat, toffee, dates, toasted malt, caramel and vanilla notes. 

Palate: Full body. Still. Liquorous mouthfeel. Warming and sugary finish. Dried fruits. 

Overall: Very similar to the original Maltus. A good sipper in very small quantity. Tasty and warming. Lack a bit of complexity for this kind of beer.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2975,"2015-03-19",3.8,"Poured an amber color liquor. Aroma of peats and residual sugar is well balance and quiet enjoyable. Taste is maybe a tad sweeter than I was expecting with nice notes of smoky peats malts. Light warming alcohol. Nice alternative to scotch.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
