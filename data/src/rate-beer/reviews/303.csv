303,"2017-05-16",4.3,"Bottle via trade, thanks Kevin! Pours a translucent mahogany with deep copper and amber hues. Medium carbonation pushes a thin off-white head. Fine lacing. Looks clean. Aromas of toffee, vanilla, caramel , brown sugar and a light oaky bourbon. Whoa. Im not a big Barley Wine fan, admittedly...so when one impresses me, it stands out. The balance here is nearly perfect. The barrel inflection is spot on. The body is medium and far from chewy, but masks the alcohol completely. Lightly sweet with hints of raisins, big toffee, vanilla and brown sugar. Very fresh and clean grain notes. The hops are extremely fresh too. Moderate dry bite. Just a delicate body with everything popping. So glad to have had this fresh! Ill take this over some of the booze bombs Ive had, anyday. Extremely impressed with this beer!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
303,"2017-05-13",3.7,"650 mL bottle. Batch 1, the re-release made me realize Id never put this one in. Originally reviewed 7/2/2014. Deep murky reddish brown body. Small welling of khaki bubbles. A very thin collar.

Taste has a better bourbon flavor. Better all around. Still a little cardboardy and oxidized. Some dark fruits to it, too. Lots of brown sugar. Woody finish. Almost spicy finish.

Dark mahogany color. Great ruby hues. Very clear until end. no head just a ring of lacing. 

 Nose is dark fruits, caramel, soft wood, soft bourbon notes, vanilla and coconut develop later after opened. 
 Taste is very bourbon forward. Must have been a beast younger. Lots of bourbon and notes of barrel. Swear it must have been with spirit as lots of caramel, vanilla and coconut. A lot of booze for the age. Bordering on spirit or port like as just very well balanced body to get that much barrel and to still get dark fruits and roasted malt. 
 Body is slightly sweet and spirit like. Has held up extremely well for the age.

303,"2013-10-02",4.4,"Massive thanks to Al aka petesuphi for sharing this one with a few of us. I never thought I would even see a bottle of this, let alone drink it. Thanks again buddy!


A - Pours cloudy orangish brown with a nice one finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty trails of lace down the glass.


S - Smells of caramel and toffee, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, smooth bourbon and some very light woody oak. The aroma is intoxicating, with all of the flavors meshing very well together. Only a tiny bit of oxidation is detectable here.


T - Starts off with the strong sweetness made up of the caramel, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar and molasses. Once the sweetness dies down the bourbon and oak help smooth it all out. There is so much going on yet it doesnt overpower the palate in any way. Once it warms up the light oxidation becomes present here as well but it never really detracts from the other flavors, it mostly lurks at the end of each sip. Finish is sweet with some light heat, lingering on the palate long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, slick feel goes down easy. Goes a touch watery at the end of the glass, combined with the light oxidation this is probably the weakest part of this beer.


O - I really enjoyed this one. It has all of the flavors I like in my barley wines and the addition of the bourbon barrel aging has made this one even better. In this bottle at least, it has definitely begun to show its age but it is still an awesome bourbon BA barley wine. I would say you should drink it sooner rather than later.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

303,"2012-08-10",4.6,"A huge thank you to David for hooking me up with this rare gem. I shared with this with a few good buddies yesterday.

Served in my Cantillon tulip.

The beer appears dark brown and mildly hazy. Crimson and sunburst highlights are evident as the light peaks through the liquid. Its slightly hazy but certainly not opaque, as one can see through the body to some degree. The head measures approximately a quarter inch and leaves some good lacing on the glass.

The aroma is fabulous, with scents of sugary caramels and candies, vanilla, oak, malt, and bourbon.

The flavor is exceptional. Vanilla and oak meld beautifully with a light bourbon note. Sugary sweet caramel tones are amazingly tasty. This is one of the only barleywines I have ever had that has a prominent sweetness about it, yet would never become cloying. Brown sugar and malt flavors are supremely enjoyable.

Wooden Hell really shines in the feel department. Ridiculously smooth, this beer goes down effortlessly. Alcohol content is an afterthought. The aging process could only have assisted what Im certain was an already terrific beer.

Overall, the best barrel-aged barleywine I have ever had and one of the best beers I have had the pleasure to taste.

303,"2011-04-07",4.3,"A ginormous amount of thanks to Huhzubendah for sharing this bottle. Served in a Bruery tulip.

The pours yields a moderately-dark brown elixir that borders on copper and seems to shine. There is a nice half-finger head that forms after the pour, sticking around for a bit of time. A few slight rings of lacing stick to the glass as it goes down. The nose is absolutely phenomenal. Just wow. It starts off with a strong showing of caramelized sugar and is then followed up by very, very smooth notes of bourbon and the accompanying oak and light vanilla. Slide notes of oxidation carry over well and fit right in.

Flavor is ridiculously good. The strong notes of caramel and brown sugar push to the front and meld beautifully with bourbon undertones. Really quite smooth. A bit of sweetness fades into very light amounts of alcohol alongside fine bourbon. Very mild oak presence pairs with a decent amount of vanilla. The mouthfeel really makes this beer. Its uber-smooth with just a touch of alcohol warmth. Age has treated this beer really, really well. 

This was an incredible experience, and huge thanks go out to Matt for sharing this with us. This was perhaps the best barleywine that Ive ever had, and I was supremely happy to share it amongst a fine group of friends. Cheers.

It was an awesome experience and great night overall. Also, WH is the best barleywine Ive ever had.

Aroma is very impressive. Sweet, sugar, caramel followed by some liquor / bourbon aromas. Some oakiness and mild vanilla. Very inviting aroma. 

Beer is medium bodied, not very carbonated on the palate, overall the lead off is this nice candied flavor that fills the palate and balances the beer well with the mild bitterness at the finish. The early midpalate is a liquory / bourbon flavor that fills out the beer without making it boozy, really drinkable. Very balanced, very great.

a - Pours a somewhat clear medium-brown color with one inch of off white head and very light carbonation evident.

303,"2010-10-11",4.8,"Wooden Hell pours an attractive chestnut-amber body with a nice depth to the hazy hue. The manila head vanishes quickly, leaving a thin wisp of foam on top. Rich nutty caramel and toffee sweetness greets the nose, followed by earthy hops and dried fruit notes of fig and prune. A flash of boozy bourbon, but more subtle than most. No real signs of oxidation--I think its safe to say this beer is holding up well.

The flavor is something to fawn over. Gooey caramel candies coat the palate; beneath that are layers of butterscotch and dusty chocolate crumbles. Booze tastes sharp and still quite green despite Wooden Hells age. Whisky wood and vanilla linger on the finish, but the heat is nicely restrained. Carbonation is tight, making for a creamy mouthfeel that keeps the thick body in check. Both spritzy and vinous on the finish with a flash of alcohol.

303,"2010-02-10",4.4,"Gold wax dipped bomber, aged in the bottle for probably 6 months or so.  Ive been looking forward to cracking this one for some time now.  The pour yields a dark, clear, chestnut brown body with a glint of burgundy. The surface is marked with just a small, swirly film, with a tiny edge of tan bubbles.  Each tilt of the glass reveals dense, viscous legging, followed by sugary micro-spots that recede back down into the body. The aromas is off-the-charts good.  Mouth-watering notes of luscious caramel and toffee are met with rum raisin, sticky buns, pecans and walnuts.  Dessert-like sweetness is perpetuated with vanilla and maple, while the perfect compliment of cocoa roast keeps the malts from getting out of control.  The flavor is delicious, bordering on stunning.  Brown sugar coated pecans remind me of a Thanksgiving pie, while the maple and toffee lend further richness.  Roasty cocoa and dark fruits bring in a bit of balancing earthiness, as warming bourbon and vanilla laden oak finish things off perfectly.  Beautifully melded sweetness lingers on the tongue well after the finish.  Appropriately low on carbonation, with just the right amount of fine, tingly fizz, the palate is slick, full, and satisfyingly warming.

Pours a deep, slightly hazy amber brown with a small, creamy beige head that recedes quickly to a collar and swirl in the middle.

The aroma is wonderful and so complex.  Its got toffee, sweet caramel malts and lots of bourbon soaked dark fruits.  The barrel character is certainly evident with oak and vanilla, though its not dominant.

The taste is just as good.  The caramel malt backbone is hefty with the sweetness coming from both the vanilla of the bourbon and the dark fruits.  Theres more of a chocolate presence than I was expecting as well.  The finish is smooth with a hefty, but not overpowering, bourbon presence.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly slick due to the bourbon character and has a slightly dry, woody finish.  The carbonation is soft but definitely noticeable.

Smell: Lush, heavy aroma of all things sweet one would find in a kitchen cupboard with notes of things one would find in the liquor cabinet.

Taste: Rich, sweet caramel, Grade B maple syrup, and melted brown sugar initially. Dried dark fruitiness. The coconut is far more prominent in the taste, presenting a small, meager sip of Malibu. Theres a spicy, earthy bitterness, but its no match for the full-on sweetness. Transient wooden tastes. More brown sugar and now some split vanilla beans.

Very sweet boozy aroma- tons of sweet buttery oak, vanilla, honey, and an alcohol sting. Slick and warm feel. Very oaky and sweet flavor. Lots and lots of vanilla- almost rum-like in its boozy sweetness and vanilla flavors. Some tannic oak earthy undertones. Too boozy and vanilla filled- lacking nuance.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Aroma is big sweet caramel, big toasted malts, not too sweet or sugary, molasses, slight burnt malts, and a big barrel presence but I think there is just barely enough malt backbone to make it work- definitely lots of wood, oak, and bourbon,. but it isnt thinning or alcoholic.  Flavor is the same- tons of malt backbone to make sure the bourbon and oak is in check- fruity esters, molasses, maple syrup huge toasted and caramel malts, slight char from the barrel, vanilla, and sweetish bourbon- alcohol is still kinda well hidden.  I liked it.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

Bold, rich flavor really dominated by that malty raisin character.  A nice, stoic presence.  Creamy and full in the mouth.  Approaches a slightly-aged Hardys Ale in its sweet malty character.  Reminds me the most of Bullfrog Oak Aged Old Toad.  Paired with some pineapple, the sweetness is allayed.  Bourbon comes through in the finish, and more so as it warms.  Nice and really bold, but not as lush and balanced as I had hoped.****************************************Bott on July 10, 2010.  Pour is medium chestnut, somewhat red around the edges.  head settles to a nice beige ring with spotty lacing.  Nose is big and pungent.  First impression is of heavy malts and bourbon.  A nice tobacco, aged leather quality really shines.  Of course dark fruits like figs and raisins.  Flavor is initially quite sweet, but the sugars are tempered by the oak and bourbon.  A bit short and spicy in the finish.  Really complex and enjoyable flavor profile.  My main knock on this right now is that the body is a tad thin, which keeps the flavors from carrying through as they might.  So many things going on -- the heavy malt, bourbon, spicy oak, dark fruits, and tobacco.  Impressive English style barleywine here, made so complex through the barrel aging.  I think its a bit better than it was last summer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

303,"2009-03-10",4.0,"22oz wax sealed bottle. A thick, oily pour produces an opaque dark brown beer with some amber highlights and a thin off-white head. Very pretty. Aroma initially smacks you in the face with a boatload of vanilla wood tannin. As the beer warms, the malt really comes forward. Creme brulee, toffee, caramel, vanilla, dates and plums. Very little hop profile. Very little alcohol presence. The barreling is done quite well. Flavor is bordering on overly sweet but never quite crosses the line. Vanilla extract, wet wood, dark chocolate, dark fruits, hazelnuts, dark rum. Toasted caramel and toffee.  Delicious. Silky and velvety mouth feel. Perfect amount of carbonation with a boozy (but not distracting) finish. I have been a bit skeptical of bourbon beers (esp. BA Barleywines) but this one is done very well. Malt and barrel in unison. Thanks Mike!

I expected yet another strong boring bourbon barrel presence but instead I got a tasty woody/cedar/oak sensation.  Expertly positioned hops greatly increase drinkability with a sharp but short bitterness, a tree bark flavour and a light citric touch.

303,"2006-10-22",4.1,"Poured a headless, deep ruby/mahogany. Thick, layered aromas find chocolate, coffee, clay, caramel, dark fruit and roasts. Palate is heavy and a little sticky & sugary but I like it. Solid, hearty flavors replicate all the goodness from the aromas with a healthy dose of whisky to just push this beer over the edge. I savored this one a little too long... by the time I went back for a refill it was gone!On tap at FSRBs <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/events-detail.asp?eve Fest!","Oak Lawn, Illinois, USA","frankenkitty"
303,"2006-09-25",4.2,"Now THATS what Im talking about!   Cornfield and I sat around just sniffing this stuff for 20 minutes before we ever decided to taste it!  What a nice barleywine...with its well blended bourbon-barrel characteristics.   Caramel, oak, bourbon, toffee, dried fruits, alcohol, sherry, vanilla, smoke....you get the picture.   Oh so good!    A fine cigar would only gild the lily!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
303,"2006-09-25",4.2,"I need more of this!  The pour gives you a deep mahogany drink with ruby highlights and practically no head.  Its hard to start drinking this, just sitting quiety and taking in the aroma is quite satisfactory.  Its a skillful blending of toffee and Bourbon and vanilla and alcohol and oak and caramel and juicy fruits and smoke.  Very smooth in the mouth, dangerously drinkable, warm as it is on the tongue.  The flavor mirrors the aroma, but the enjoyment is intensified because now the fumes are filling every cavity in the skull.  The finish is sweet and hot with a mild alcohol afterburn.

303,"2006-09-18",4.0,"Draft 4-28-06. Have to agree with Pailhead here, I have some bourbon nose hairs for sure, (cuz for the most part I cant stand the stuff), and didnt detect any in this whatsoever. Neither did I get any oak/wood or vanilla. Pretty convinced it had to be a different beer than what everyone else had. Anyway, Dark transparent amber/mahogany with minimal head. Aroma sort-of hot, but just straight alcohol aroma not bourbon. Plenty of caramel and toffee, no hop presence. Flavor again, all caramel and toffee, very chewy/bready, faint hop character in the finish. Big residuel sweetness aftertaste, borderline cloying. Still a nice BW altogether.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
303,"2006-09-11",3.0,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2006 This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized bubbles that was mostly lasting and left behind a no visible carbonation dark ruby red brown colored body and a very good lacing. The mild aroma was malty vinous and sweet. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a strong vinous aftertaste. The strong vinous flavor contained notes of sweet malt and bourbon but was missing the hops. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.  Not sure I would have called this one a barley wine at all.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
303,"2006-08-13",3.8,"Dk brown cloudy pour thick brown head hints of red.  Aroma of bourbon & oak some light hints of hop very mellow.  Palate is rich & creamy.  Flavor is buttery bourbon w/ a dry and very sweet grassy finish.  Good but lacks the barleywine characteristics.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
303,"2006-07-14",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub on 4/28/06: Pours a clear deep copper mahogany brown with a thin-lacing off-white head.  Rich, sweet caramel bourbony aroma has some vanilla oaky complexity.  Body starts with good sweet caramel malty flavor with lots of oaky vanilla, a touch of butterscotch and some warming alcohol.  A nice, barrel-aged barleywine.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
303,"2006-05-25",3.4,"Thanks to Floosmoor for breaking this out for the Ratebeer guys.Wonderful aroma of oak,vanilla along with some very ripe pears.Very nice. Not over done in my opinion.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"
303,"2006-05-22",3.8,"On tap, FlossmoorRB gathering. Good stuff.  Aroma was light, vanilla and boubon.  Pour was a ruby garnet color.  Flavor was sweet, caramel like. Sugars and fruit combined nicely.  Palate was nicely bodied and finish was sticky but dry. I really enjoyed it.","Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA","Firemoose15"
303,"2006-05-13",3.9,"Draft at Flossmoor Station served in a snifter. Small tan head that mostly diminsihed with nice lacing, transparent, and a ruby hue. Nose was lightly hoppy, vanilla notes, oak, and bourbon. Flavor started off sweet then turned vinuous, and somewhat dry at the end. Tingly, sticky and warm mouthfeel. Medium-full body.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
303,"2006-05-07",4.2,"Draft @ Flossmoor Station:  Clear ruby color with a medium sized beige head.  Very sweet malty and fruity aroma.  Notes of cherries is the dominant fruit.  Fair amount of bourbon in the aroma but balanced very nicely.  Light alcohol in the nose.  The flavor was sweet and sugary with a nice amount of fruit and malt.  The bourbon flowed at the finish.  Some alcohol and a nice warming sensation.  Very nice beer.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
303,"2006-05-05",4.2,"Since I was driving home, couldnt have more than a sample of this brew.  Too bad.  The best thing Ive had at Flossmoor.  But the sample testified to the quality of this barley wine.  Dark black with red highlights topped by a small, creamy beige head.  Served nicely in a snifter as it should.  Lots of bourbon in the nose along with some milk chocolate, vanilla, sweet cherries, oak cask.  Full bodied with a thick texture.  Warm alcohol feel going down, notes of bourbon, some sweetness, dry finish.  Damn good.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
303,"2006-05-01",4.5,"Sweet nectar aroma with a definite bourbon character. Dark red in color, almost opaque, but when held to the light can see the dark reddish color. Excellent lace and yellow head. Strong alcohol profile. Creamy, thick bourbon notes with some hop. Well balanced.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
303,"2006-05-01",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2012 Draft... Pre-DLD06...This beer rocks!... Clear, mahogany ale with a small, creamy, beige head. Great retention. Caramel, light chocolate and light bourbon in the nose. The flavor is sweet, then bitter with notes of caramel and sourmash. Full-bodied and syrupy with medium carbonation. Finishes alcoholic and dry. Very warm, but not nearly as ""hot"" as Ellas Reserve. World class effort!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
303,"2006-04-30",4.0,"Snifter on tap at the Friday Night pre-release DL party, thanks brewers!  The beer displays a deep slighty muddled ruby hue with some oily and sticky cling to the grassware. The aroma has notes of vanilla, oak and bourbon which is very characteristic of Woodford Reserve aging. Also detected some brown sugar, grassy hops, pepper, and earthy esters.  The taste is very sweet at first as well has fruity and a little vinous fig notes but a sharp peppery and alcohol character cuts through and makes it enjoyable. A woody and very dry finish. The mouth feel is very sticky, lush, and full-bodied. Moderately warming as well.  A wonderful take on barrel aging once it opened up let the hops show. Digging it, rating #2400, Another One Bites The Dust, SUTA!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
303,"2006-04-30",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2007 On tap at the brewpub: Deep brown with a tan creamy head. A hint of boubon but not a whole lot. Some vanilla, malts, a little sweetness. Flavor is rich and malty, some subdued hops.

Re-Rate 4/27/2007: This stuff got even better. Mellowed out a lot. Alcohol really softened, everything came together quite well.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
303,"2006-04-30",4.3,"On tap at Flossmoor Station, sampled the day of the DL gathering. Pours a dark brown mahogany hue. Nose is not only bourbon, but clearly Woodford Reserve bourbon (yes, its scary that one can pick this out.) On the nose, lots of vanilla, cherry, bourbon, sherry. More of the same on the palate, with a pleasant bourbon/hops/alcohol finish. One of the better barleywines Ive had in awhile, and one that I could see ageing very well. More on the sweeter side, much to my liking.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
303,"2006-04-30",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2007 Draft at FSRB, 4/28/06. Deep dark brown color with a trim half-inch tan head. Deep bourbon smell. Chewy, malty and, um, malty. And then the taste piles on the bourbon and oak. Only halfway down the glass I got a funny feeling in the back of my neck; the hops bitterness finally arrived. Turned out to be my second of three barrel aged beers this weekend.Draft at FS, 6/20/07. Darn thing pulls some surprises a year later. In a snifter, it shows a bubbly head, building up a ""curb"" around the edge. Heady smell of brandy, raisins and plums. Oddly, the taste is much sweeter than I remembered. On top of the plum notes, theres a bit of Juicy Fruit, like a slight souring. Bigger alcohol warming, with a whiskey finish. I see my origiinal rating of ""4.0"" is the mean for this brew.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
303,"2006-04-30",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2006 On tap:  Aroma of caramel, toffee, banana bread, and some citrus hops.  Not detecting any bourbon in the nose.  Transparent red with some orange hilights and small of-white head with decent retention.  Lots of sweet caramel and banana bread up front and finishes with mild citrus hops.  Very sticky mouthfeel.  Once again, Im not detecting any bourbon in the flavor.  Had to check with the bartender to make sure they werent serving two different barley wines.  I was assured they werent, but everyone at the Flossmoor gathering noticed a bourbon presence in this beer.  I definitely did not.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
303,"2006-04-29",4.0,"Poured a reddish mahogany color with a small, light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of vanilla oak, bourbon, citrus fruits, and sticky caramel malts.  Taste of smoke, dried fruits, caramel malts, citrus fruits, medium bitterness, and medium alcohol in the finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
303,"2006-04-28",4.0,"Pours to a garnet colored body with a lasting tan head.  The flavor is sweet Maris Otter malts.  Subtle hops.  Subtle barrel aging.  Sweet stickyness.  The palate is sweet, barrely.  The aroma is lightly hoppy, nice sweet malts and barrel aging.  The Woodford Reserve bourbon is barely noticeable but is apparent as beeing that brand.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
