3720,"2017-03-14",4.1,"From a fresh growler that was filled (counter pressure) 48 hours ago. The aroma on this is really nice with light hints of peat, an underlying sweetness, and a little nuttiness. Light berries are also present. Very nice aroma. An attractive transparent amber body is present on this with a smallish off-white head. Starts with a nice and sweet maltiness. This is a nice malt bomb with delicate peat flavors coming through the middle. Nice carbonation. Virtually no bitterness. Extremely easy-drinking and very sessionable. This is just a world-class example of the style.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

3720,"2012-03-17",4.0,"Excellent red.  Aroma is sweet malts, and a little of that classic scotch ale peat... I guess thats why theyre referring to it as a Celtic Ale.  Sweet malt, and a little peat smoked malt up front, and a long, complex, and very large finish with just a hint of bitterness.  This is a very big beer considering the ABV.  I like it a lot.","California, USA","bigabe"
