I figured that I would grab this because it stood a better chance of not getting stuck in the logjam of imperial stouts that are Hoppin¬í Frog¬ís trademark at this point. Indeed it didn¬ít let me down much. If not for the price I would consider buying a few more especially if it turns out to be more of a seasonal than a limited one off.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid black base supports a pillar of mocha head with a creamy profile. Chocolate dipped coffee beans enrich the air along with a malty backbone. The sweet edge cuts into the dry feel of the porter¬ís heart.

Flavor / Palate - A thin bodied and sweet feel permeates the tongue, throat, and more with a texture of dairy creamer. The finish falls a bit short of fantastic though it does get the job done well enough that finishes the bottle was not a chore. Chocolate and bitter coffee wrap up this novel twist on Silk Porter. I¬íd still probably rather take the plain Silk Porter though if given the choice.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

160,"2014-08-16",4.0,"Bottle... Muckfest 2014¬Ö This beer rocks!¬Ö Pours murky and dark brown with a mid-sized, creamy, beige head. Terrific retention. The nose is a fantastic swirl of coffee, peanut butter, hazelnut, chocolate cr√®me and vanilla. Medium-bodied and super creamy with lackluster carbonation. Deeply roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel and toasted nuts in the sweet, vanilla-driven flavor. World class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
160,"2014-08-03",4.2,"On draught at the Hoppin¬í Frog Tasting Room on 04/19/2014 (deemed unratable initially, but subsequently allowed): The beer is a dark brown color with a medium foamy light beige head that diminishes steadily to a thin outer ring. Short strings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate, coffee and peanut butter. Medium-bodied with flavors of roasted coffee, chocolate malt and peanut butter. The finish is roasty with a cocoa and peanut butter aftertaste. Enjoyable beer all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
160,"2014-07-21",4.4,"Bottle. Darkest brown pour with a thick tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, peanut butter and roasted malt. Malty and roasty flavor with coffee and chocolate before a peanut butter finish. Exquisite.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
160,"2014-07-16",3.7,"22 oz. bottle shared by JaBier, who showed me that this one should indeed be rateable because it was brewed with coffee and bottled, and not just pulled through a randall. Anyway, it pours a deep brown color with a small beige head that leaves some film and a ring. Notes of fudge, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and a nuttiness that suggests peanut butter, but the sweeter version that would be inside a Reese¬ís. Surprisingly sweet, actually. That¬ís what differentiates it from the Cafe Silk Porter, to me. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth, sweet mouthfeel. Interesting beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
