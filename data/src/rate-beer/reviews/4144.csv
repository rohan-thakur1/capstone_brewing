4144,"2009-01-18",4.6,"2007 vintage, courtesy JMFG.  Wow!  This is outstanding.  The pour yields a still, lightly hazy, medium golden hued body.  Moderate legging shows after a swirl of the glass.  The nose is beautiful, like a perfectly orchestrated symphony of raw honey, fresh wildflowers, cinnamon, clove, and vanilla.  I cant get over how amazing this smells.  It is easily one of the most fantastic aromatic experiences Ive come across in a beverage.  Having alot to live up to, the flavor does not disappoint.  Rich, sweet, wildflower honey seems steeped with cinnamon stick and ground clove.  Vanilla runs through and through.  The sweetness is cut with just enough acidity to avoid being overbearing.  Medium-full, slick, and creamy on the palate, even the mouthfeel is outstanding.  This is fantastic stuff.  If I were a millionaire, I would bathe in it.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

4144,"2007-05-26",4.8,"Props to Boboski for the bottle.  The aroma of this mead is captivating for sure.  Not what I expected--but a intriguing blend of acidity and sweet honey.  This smells like a white zinfandel with a splash of honey mixed in.  The apperance is a very clean, light golden color that causes you to pause to take in its beauty.  The palate is full, but not overly thick like some meads can be--very palatable...Nice sweet honey flavor with some alcohol burn detectable.  Floral spices are present throughout and play perfectly with the sweetness of the honey.  The finish is nice and dry, with hints of the vinuous aspects coming through more in the lingering aftertaste.  This is truly incredible.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

4144,"2007-05-01",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2007 Pristine, simple, still honey-golden pour. Very thin, wispy legs. Looks regal, nearly resembling liquified gold blended with saffron oils. Aroma is ancient in feel and fully developed and truly captivating. Notes of honey, barren cherry orchards and hot and spicy cinnamon candy stand out. Alcohol levels encroach on caustic, though they never reach that level and instead remain a complimentary and integral part of the nose. Other fruit nuances are noticeable but are well-hidden behind the veil of honey. Flavors are just as riveting. Cinnamon and cumin spicing pounce forward, leaving behind a solid wave of raw honey and tinges of fresh whole cloves. Alcohol is more apparent, warming on its way down. Acidity is remarkably high for a dessert mead, for a dessert wine in general. Sweetness is lessened by this notable trait, providing excellent balance and maintaining drinkability. Spicing is heavier than desired, though all this really does to the overall flavor profile is add a sense of creativity and allure to take the next sip. Finishes off-dry and grainy, with noted small particulates in what little is left behind. Palate is well-wrought and generally smooth, Medium full in body. This unique beverage deserves its place in the spotlight, no matter how dim that light becomes as new meads prove more exciting or more elusive.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

I found it to be very similar to the meads Ive sampled previously from Smokehouse Winery.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
4144,"2006-07-15",3.6,"in comparison, much lighter that Jadwiga...which more or less set the tone for the rest of it...smell was great.  sweet honey, berries, but the flavor had a medicinal tone to it that was detracting.  thebody was also not nearly as viscous as its primary competition.  an enjoyable meade, but a far cry from the top of the ladder.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
4144,"2006-06-19",4.3,"Light golden liquid with tall legs. Honey, and exotic perfumes fill the nose. Lots of floral scents along with light spice of ginger, cloves and cinnamon.  Honey fruit and flowers strewn about the place in the flavor. LIghtly warming on the the palate. This does not get thick and sticky, rather stays light and balanced through out. Certainly wouldnt mind having more of this about. Thanks Tom for sharing.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4144,"2006-05-03",4.1,"Pours a clear viscous still pale golden with nice legs.  Sweet floral fruity sugary complex honey aroma is verey enticing.  Rich, sweet viscous floral clover honey body has a very nice complex flavor and well-balanced sweet and warming alcohol.  A very nice mead, but definitely not something I could afford to drink too regularly.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4144,"2006-04-17",4.0,"My first mead and I love it! Bottled Oct 2004. Poured a clear pale yellow with small particles afloat. Aromas of honey, orange, and a slight hint of alcohol. Sweet honey flavor with light spices. A great warming dessert drink .A wonderful wine alternative that Ill probably fool many a friend with. Thanks to Springslicker for introducing this style to me at the Tennessee Tasting!","Huntsville, Alabama, USA","BeerHawk"
4144,"2006-04-16",4.1,"Bottle with waxed cork. Pours still, clear, pale yellow and sticks to the glass beautifully. The aroma is earthy, sweet honey and a little bit of alcohol. The flavor is very sweet and assertive honey and a very subtle alcohol warmth. This definitely has to be savored; anything more than sipping would be overwhelming. But a very, very good mead.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
4144,"2006-04-04",4.1,"Big thanks to Tom for sharing.  Clear yellow body, no head.  Very interesting aroma - pollen, orange peel, sweet honey.  Sweet plant stem flavor with smooth, sweet honey.  Delicous!  Spicy alcohol bite in the finish that really rounds out the flavor.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
4144,"2006-04-02",4.3,"Wow.. this stuff rocks. Huge thanks to the Couga for this one. Pours a clear very pale yellow. No head. Aroma is lemons, honey, very floral sweet notes. Flavor is very sweet, almost no alcohol bite, sweet honey, vanilla, tasty. very drinkable. Smooth. Very easy to drink. VERY nice. Thanks Tom","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
4144,"2006-03-29",4.0,"Flowery aroma: orange blossoms and spice, noticeable alcohol...very complex and strong, strong, strong.  Spicey flavor with lots going on so that it blends to an almost medicinal note..but not in a bad way...super sweet and warming.  Really full body, with a creamy mouthfeel.  Thanks CaptainCougar for sharing this bottle.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
4144,"2006-03-27",4.2,"Bottle, November 2004, special thanks to CaptainCougar for the opportunity!  Poured a still pale golden with some beautiful legs.  Very rich and sweet flavor profile with the freshest honeycomb (felt freshly-squeezed!), ripe apples, and hints of a warm spice blend.  Thick and most-assuredly coating flavors of the aforementioned honey, apples, and spices... add a tiny bit of caramel.  Wow!  Edges of the palate found lightly-sour lighter fruit notes.  Alcohol provided a mild accent to the flavors, and was warming as this delicious nectar oozed down the throat.  This was phenominal!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4144,"2006-03-27",4.3,"Transparent and lucid pale yellow in color.  Motionless and void of other life.  Expressive aroma allures with honey nectar, clover, lilies of the valley and alcohol presence.  Hot, exquisite nectar rejoices throughout the mouth.  Margarine-like feel lands in the mouth, spreads slowly downward and slowly drips off the tongue.  Honey stolen straight from the queen bee is our resplendent booty.  Warming alcohol tickles the tongue, nearly stinging, but comes through as more of a seducer.  Thick liquid pool exits our playing field, warming with buttery honey.  Such a damn tasty treat - thanks for bringing this along, CaptainCougar!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4144,"2006-03-26",3.7,"Thanks Tom!  The mead pours to a thin light yellow watery color and looks like toxic airplane glue.  The aroma is sweet apple honey, interesting floral components like lavendar.  The flavor is sweet yellow apples, honey, lavendar, honeysuckle.  Its delicate and balanced.  The palate is sweet and sugary, coating and good.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4144,"2006-03-25",4.0,"clear golden color w/ nice legs.    Hugely sweet aroma lots of honey and warm notes of alcohol tchs of candied sugarz.  Full palate well coated and warming.  Flavor is very sweet just honey fermented.  Good stuff.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
4144,"2006-02-21",4.0,"Thanks to the Schrades men for this one.  2004 Vintage.  Poured a lcear pale yellow color.  Has the smell of that old candy that has the jucie inside a wax tube. Also notes of honey and hard candy.  Flavor is very sweet with some more honey (imagine that) and candy.  Very tasty and very warming.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
4144,"2006-02-02",3.6,"2004 bottle.  Very light yellow (urine) color, though not in an unappealing way.  Crystal clear.  Aroma of crisp alcohol, honey, candy, clover and cinnamon.  Light on the tongue.  Easy though sweet through to the finish (tasted like the candy liquid you used to get in the wax bottle).  Alcohol warmth.  Enjoyable enough for me, but John thought this was the best thing he had ever had.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
4144,"2006-01-30",4.2,"Bottle Vintage 04 Beeswax sealed cork.
Briliantly clear, light yellow, still mead. Coats the glass nicely with strong legs.
Warm honey, floral spice and alcohol come easily to the nose. Allow this to warm and it blooms wonderfully. 
Sweet, alcoholic palate asks that you sip slowly and allow the flavors to come forward.  World class.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
4144,"2006-01-29",4.5,"This is a very pale yellow color. This is a still mead. Rich scuppernong, toast and a touch of leaf litter float around in the aroma. Beatiful flavor with sage and a touch of butter. Wow. This is amazing stuff.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
4144,"2005-12-04",3.4,"A light yellow mead - ofcourse with no head. The aroma contains strong notes of alcohol and rosehips, while the flavor is sweet with a subtle presence of honey and rosehips, combined with a slight alcohol burn.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
4144,"2005-08-01",4.2,"Bottle into Duvel tulip.  Sampled at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel CA with cquiroga.  I drove around the sleepy hamlet of Niwot looking for the fabled Medovina meadery and could not find it.  It is certainly tucked away, as Im pretty sure I drove every ""main street"" they had.  Nevertheless, I found this at Liquor Max in Loveland just up the road, and bought the last bottle they had.  Its good to know its popular in the real world of central CO and not just on the virtual world of Ratebeer.  It deserves acclaim in both places.  Floral sweet smell is like sour apricots and a cologne musk.  Slightly pale medium yellow-orange color.  The taste is floral and lighter than Jadwiga, sweeter and smooth.  Not syrupy at all.  Apricots, green grapes and honey flavors.  The finish is spicy with a bit of alcohol sting.   Although the alcohol is quite noticable, its a very nice complement, not at all distracting or overbearing.  It doesnt touch Jadwiga in my book, but the fact that I can actually compare it to that king of meads is a complement in and of itself.  Dopeness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
4144,"2005-07-25",4.3,"Sampled from bottle at RBSG 2005 post-Cider Tour Sunday JonBenet Is Still In My Heart tasting.  Light thick clear but oily gold with big legs...intoxicating, perfumy nose, apples and lavender competing with the primary honey tones, warm and autumnal...very light, almost fluffy mouthfeel, very sweet with light alcohol warming, hints of stinging pepper late along with dry marzipan...strange unexplainable effervescent, zingy mouthfeel despite lack of carbonation...rather dry finish....wondrous and unique.  Vast thanks to Ernest who capped this last tasting beautifully.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Nice finish of light tannic qualities. I think this is my 2nd mead and it was light years better than the first.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
4144,"2005-07-21",4.3,"07.10.05  Bottle, RBSG.  Pale straw, still.  Very sweet with concentrated honey and floral nectar.  Some hints of armpit though it seems to work.  Alcohol is totally masked.  Such balance.  Body is light despite sweetness and strength.  Crisp, tart, almost tingly.  Great that this is a US made mead.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
4144,"2005-07-12",4.4,"Herbal, floral, minty, musky, personal aroma with some light hints of alcohol.  Still, deep, golden colour with viscous lacing on the sides of the glass.  Very sweet, spicy, herbaceous, floral flavour with some fruitiness.  This one is all honey.  Strong alcohol warming with a thick, rich body that fills the mouth and lingers on the tongue.  Fantastic.  Bottle savoured with MartinT, Olivier_MTL and Rastacouere.  Resampled just over a week later at the RBSG hotel tasting with largely the same impressions.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
4144,"2005-06-29",3.6,"The Lure:Candy emerges and takes the shape of sports card bubblegum sticks. Flowers protrude proudly from the lemon orchard. Medecinal herbs are drawn from this peculiar meadow, helped into healing by alcohol. 

The Festivities:Flower petals litter the ground where a plethora of various fruit rests. Honey sweetness is overshadowed by the herbal, flowery dominion. Alcohol burns easily through the rather thin body for its size. Again, I am reminded of some sort of childish, powdery candy, which is not what Im looking for in a mead. A touch more of honey sweetness, and thus a bigger body, would have seduced me more. Wiping out that candy bubblegum from my mind would help as well.

Transcendence:The bright lights couldnt reach my soul this time.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
4144,"2005-06-27",4.3,"Clearish still golden hue proposes delicate legs. The aroma is a 9 as soon as the bottle is opened. Highly perfumey scents seize the room atmosphere and make it their own. Obvious low-capacity craftmanship procures extras, atypical flavor notes you just couldnt imagine from a big house with sweaty cologne, polishy, but as a quality for once and floral with a capital F. Floral and Fruity. Endless list of fruit nuances, candyish in fashion, but medicinal in its soul. The backing honey sweetness never becomes too much, at times leaning on the werthers original end of the spectrum, but always taking firm grounds on a rich nectar basis. Passion fruit and mango remain on the palate as well. The 14% alcohol is contained masterfully. Parsley, juicy, clovey and minty, all at once, one after the other, depending on how you want it. An highly satisfying and deeply artisanal mead. Oily still body, liquorous in intentions, as smooth as elegant. Awesome! Thanks Ern!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4144,"2004-12-31",4.4,"Pale pear. Filmy, but legless, with random tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Brassy, white grape aroma coupled with tannic acidity, toasted oak, and lavender. Very estery. Soft body and gently crunchy. Bafflingly complex with crystallized sugar and pear grit underscored by a delicate sparkle of acidity. Alcohol heats the gullet, but remains restrainedly forceful due to the immense softness and bright melon cushion. Mild oak presence, coupled with tannins, cut more of the sweetness while simultaneously emphasizing the dryness. Extremely soft and elegant, throughout, as melon and flower notions continue to smoothen the coarse alcohol and tannic impact. Finishes decadently rich, sugary, and pristinely polished with lavender splashed with rosewater and honey. Utterly blissful and confoundingly bright and cohesive. A humbling gift from Emily and Ernest.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4144,"2004-11-25",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2007 2006 bottling. No head (still). Body is slightly hazy medium yellow. Aroma is notes of honey, alcohol, caramel, flowers, candied fruits (citrus, peach), cantaloupe. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Full body, watery/syrupy texture, flat carbonation (although lightly effervescent naturally), lightly/moderately astringent. Not quite as amazing as the first vintage, but still damned good. Aroma is slightly milder, but still pretty much the same (maybe a trace of fusels?). Flavor is beautiful, but maybe just a wee bit sticky-sweeter than I remember it...could be my imagination.  Overall still awesome, but probably needs some time in the bottle to develop...this is wine, after all.

2003 vintage (bottled in 2004). No head (still). Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is notes of honey, alcohol, caramel, flowers, candied fruits (citrus, peach), cantaloupe, hints of cinnamon and ginger. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Full body, watery/syrupy texture, flat carbonation (although lightly effervescent naturally), lightly/moderately astringent. THIS is what Im talkin about!  Mark labels this as a dessert mead, but dont be fooled; it isnt cloying at all...the finish is delectably clean and balanced perfectly with acidity and tannins to make you immediately ready for another sip.  This is *exactly* what I want when I think mead...sweet and rich with honey, but not at all fatiguing or sticky.  The aroma is initially fairly alcoholic, but that fades fairly quickly (meads really deserve to be treated like wines with respect to breathing time...and Medovina meads are definitely best after 30-90 minutes of aeration)...leaving you with nothing but succulent honey, flowers, fruit, and spice.  Beautiful, amazing mead that is now my top pick of all the meads Ive had to date.  Buy this by the case.  Go Mark!!!!  (rating: 4.7)","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
