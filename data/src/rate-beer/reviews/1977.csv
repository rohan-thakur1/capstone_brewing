Pours a deep, dark chocolate-brown color with cola edges; creamy, medium-tan head: mixed bubbles, solid retention and scattered, web-like lacing. Theres a persistent metallic note in the aroma, which is disappointing because of how solid everything is underneath: milk chocolate, roasted and burnt malts, along with some nicely presented peat: minimally astringent for how much roast and charred character is present here; the peatiness (if thats what Im getting here) is just lovely, everything well-integrated in the nose; that metallic note really exists on the edge of things, and fades quickly once your nose is in the glass; excellent aside from the off-note. Medium-full body; moderate, tight carbonation; creamy presence in the mouth, with just a touch of a wateriness on the edges (very strange for how much is packed in here, but there you go); high amounts of milk and dark chocolate notes, roasted malts, with hints of smoke and peat throughout; heavy amounts of charred, woody character, even though this isnt barrel-aged to my knowledge (and it doesnt taste like it is): the peat and bitter chocolate and charred malts just give a similar impression; a couple of very slight flaws (metal, water), this is ever so close to being an absolutely awesome beer; the peat, chocolate, and roasted malts are carefully presented alongside one another, and theres just enough sharpness and acidity to balance out the inherent creaminess. Solid stuff, with just very slight hints of a lactic character. Long, long finish of bitter chocolate, roasted and charred malts, and mineral bitterness; a nicely dry, well-roasted ending.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Comment:
A stout with a weak smell and mild taste. Feels balanced but not very complex. Despite the small bottle and dark appearance it was quite easy to drink. Could probably work just as well in bigger bottles.

The most dominate flavour was chocolate. These kinds of beers usually have allot of roasted and coffee flavours but in this beer both where pretty mild. I think a bigger portion of those flavours would increase the overall flavour of the beer.

I tried it with some chocolate and it was a great match. Worked with both chocolate cake and truffles.

All in all a very drinkable beer but it feels like it lacks certain flavours and the body is a bit to light for my taste.  Re-rated in 2013.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

Maturation did its job very nice. Less burnt. Berries and juniper developed. Good roundiness. Nice.
 Sampled draught at Stockholm Beer Festival. 
Black with a dark brown head. Earthy, slight licoricy, milky aroma and flavour. Sweetish.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"

Definately black. Aroma is some licorice. Flavor is alittle sweet, but changes into a bitter finish.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"

Really black. Distinct creamy chocolate aroma with a touch of licorice. Sweet nose, big rounded maltiness. Roasty and fruity with salty bitterish finish. The most powerful so far of Nynäshamns many beers.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
