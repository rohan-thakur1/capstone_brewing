3699,"2016-04-29",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2016 Murky, deep red pour with a thin beige head. Huge caramel and nut aroma with a little floral note to it. Taste is more of that caramel, a slight fruitiness, little bit of bitterness. Pretty damn pleasant","AUSTRALIA","varanid99"
3699,"2015-04-25",3.7,"Draught at CBM. Rich hoppy flavors of berries, toffee, dark malt, hint of spice. Nice red ale, one of their better brews.","","biirusaikou"
3699,"2015-03-21",3.6,"Pours a cloudy reddish colour with an off-white head. Aroma is malt, fruit, caramel and hops. Taste is medium sweet leading to a moderate hoppy finish.","Central Coast, NSW, AUSTRALIA","Sevenlee"
3699,"2015-02-21",3.4,"330 ml bottle. Pours dark amber, somewhat reddish as suggested by the name. Some nice foam, actually stays a bit, then comes down leaving a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a bit skunky - in a sense that you can feel the hops but there seems to be not much to balance them out. Bit of fruitiness, bit of caramel, toffee. Taste reveals somewhat rough and edgy but nevertheless enjoyable hoppy beer. It is unpolished but I guess thats part of the allure. Not bad and for 6% has enough to be pretty good.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
3699,"2015-02-12",3.8,"On tap at Popeye in Tokyo. Served in a shaker half pint glass. Beautiful eye of Jupiter red color with a minimal head. Floral hops on the nose along with some malt sweetness present. Initial taste is strongly malt and grain. Malt flavor does overpower the floral hops at the start, but the bitterness from the hops stands out on the finish. Caramel sweetness and creaminess also present on the palate.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
3699,"2014-12-13",3.5,"Small glass on draft at Tadgs. Clear amber with off-white head. Aromas of floral, citrus, light toasty notes. Tastes of citrus, malt, toasty and floral notes. Medium body with a dry finish.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
3699,"2014-11-01",3.1,"Dark red. Light head. Silent nose. A little booze, nice malt, some hops. Overall grain and light booziness.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
3699,"2014-08-14",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2014 Draught at Bungalow. Rusty amber with off-white head. Great hoppy nose, some spice and fruit. Flavour has some malty caramel, quickly overtaken by big hop bitterness.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
3699,"2014-06-23",3.6,"Draught at Bungalow. Lovely deep cherry red, with an off-white head. Very subtle and interesting. Starts off sweet, then with a rich middle, before finishing with a hoppy bitter finish. Sounds like a grab bag of flavours, but it comes together beautifully. Not half as sweet as other Japanese red ales I've had. Subtle, warming yet cleansing. Malt and berry fruit notes very satisfying.","Kyoto, JAPAN","Westkyoto77"
3699,"2013-10-18",3.6,"Bottle traded with TimE. Cloudy light brown reddish ale with a medium to large big foam slightly off white head. Nose has lots of fresh hop zing in it. Grapefruit citrous, lots of caramel, toffee, slight nuttiness, slight lactic creaminess, minerally. Taste is caramel, toffee, nutty tang, bitter hop, grapefruit citrous, and some earthier hop, ale fruity. Its good but maybe a little too much going on.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"
3699,"2013-07-15",3.5,"On tap at the GJBF Osaka, 6%. Kind of an amber reddish pour, the flavor is a spicy malt, full bodied rich and more on the bitter side. A really solid red ale though the color is a bit light but flavor wise they nailed it.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
3699,"2013-07-01",3.6,"Bottle, 07/01/2013. Pours burnt caramel, thin off-white head fades to a nice crema on the surface with a ring of lacing around the glass. Aroma is burnt, buttery biscuit, toasted malts, light orange hops, grassy finish. Taste is grapefruit, bready roasted caramel malts, long grassy, piney bitter finish. Medium body. Nice beer, satisfies that hop craving.","New York, USA","jbeatty"

330 ML bottle

Clear, darker amber color. One finger white head. Good head retention and lacing with this. 

Good hoppy nose. Orange, pine grapefruit with a caramel biscuit backbone. Was not expecting that at all. Quite surprised. 

Good rounded pine, grapefruit, and grass bitterness with caramel and biscuit. Slightly oily and good amount of resin. Lively in the mouth. 

Quit a nice beer. Will seek out again","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"

3699,"2011-10-16",3.7,"Big, full bodied beer. Lots of caramel and toffee with a moderate bitterness for the supposed 85IBU. Very moreish and opens up nicely as it warms to reveal some dried fruits and a little nuttiness. A solid english/american hybrid ale.","JAPAN","jonno"
3699,"2011-07-28",3.6,"Amber red color. Very earthy, cherries and strawberries in the nose. Solid malt backbone with aggressive hopiness, but the result is more like an aggressive hoppy summer red ale. Not sweet. Good depth. Yum. Hint of tangerines and cherries in mouth.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
