batch 2 - Many thanks to Kevin for the bottle.

Pours a cloudy peach-yellow color with a one finger broad, stable head.

The nose offers a complex tartness between citrus peel, sparkling wine, bretts and a note of vinegar. This impression gets enhanced, due to hay, wet grass, tree bark, earthy mushrooms and a mineral quality. Sweeter, fermented grapes blend flawlessly into the funky character of the beer, among a well pronounced foundation of straw and wheat.

Has a lower carbonation with an almost smooth mouthfeel, due to soft water and a medium body.

Begins with bread, minerals, unripe citrus pulp and hay. Old, fermented white grapes become recognizable during the middle part, revealing not only a fruity note, but also a mellow hop presence among sweeter turning malts, still providing a decent amount of earth. The beer got a sparkling wine aspect to it, leading to a very refreshing, slightly fruity impression, finishing with an enjoyable bitterness and a slick, long lasting citrus dryness.

Fantastic beer, with a generous depth of different flavors, while it comes together convincingly well. Exhibits a tart fruitiness, with both citrus and grapes, while hay and wheat build up an incredible soft, enjoyable mouthfeel, through which the flavors can unfold without any distractions. Finishes tart, while not getting monotonous sour, almost like a Belgian sour.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Some pear, a touch of lactic notes, & a strong barn stall funk throughout. Taste has a bit more lemon, peach, & stone fruit out of the gate. Tart, bordering on sour.

Wet hay & barnyard funk with a hint of that rotten pineapple & sharp lemon zest that you often get from certain strains of brettanomyces.

Initial is lighter end of the fold in body showing some good sourness, lemony lactic zing meets some softer yogurt, gentle cereal grains, bread, and dry crackling straw. Touches of flaked wheat, crab apple and pear. Some nice lemon rind perkiness as we hit the middle, more yogurt, funky cobwebs start to cut through a bit more. Some dryness, deadened body into the backend. Tart, funky and dry, some cobwebs really start to stick. Its lighter bodied but offers a pleasant feel on the palate, enveloping it with plenty of sour lactic zing, gentle bready malt backgroun and that developing bretty funk. Dry, a bit slick as we finish up. This is really nice stuff, sour and lively, nice development and flow. Wow.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Light pale grainy backend. Nice... White wine essence and lemon with pale grain throughout. Clean with a nice lactic tartness. Creamy bodied, easy going with a lighter level of carbonation. Very nice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
