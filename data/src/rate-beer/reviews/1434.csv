1434,"2015-08-15",3.7,"How: Bottle (12 oz) at home. 

>>> A simple, clean, easy drinking and rather authentic Altbier that could use a little more body and malt depth. 

- Slightly hazy bright copper with a medium off-white head and some lacing 
- Aroma is delicate but features some interesting toasted malts and caramel notes (+) 
- Taste is a bit more complex with some fruity notes and bread alongside toasted malts and caramel (+) 
- Body is a bit light and, even though the mouthfeel isnt watery, a little more body would help (-) 
- Carbonation is medium 
- The beer is really clean and easy drinking (++) 
- The malt depth is ok, but still far from the best of the styles like Schumacher (-)

I get malts, crystal malts, caramel malts, some earthy malts and then a pretty nice bite of spicy hops, a sliver of earthy hops and sort of vague like hop bitterness that adds to the depth and the balance of the beer.

1434,"2013-01-07",4.0,"The ""alt bier"" style is a rare commodity these days, even among the American craft beer scene. I think because it tends to be a rather boring style so its difficult to make a brew that really stands out from the pack. But Hangar 24 has apparently figured out the formula with their Alt-Bier as it has a unique palate and high drinkability. 

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Beautiful reddish/burnt umber hue; very hazy. Forms an average size, beige, soapy head which mostly dissipates but still laces the glass pretty well.

Smell: Surprisingly mild nose with a vague malty aroma with a hint of fruit.

Taste: Its extremely rare that the description on the bottle or the brewers website is 100% accurate to how I perceive the taste, but in the case of Hangar 24 Alt-Bier its exactly dead-on: 

""Caramel, Toasty, and Clean. This red ale is our unique version of a northern German Alt-Bier. Enjoy silky caramel smoothness, followed by toasty, bready flavors and finished with a hint of chocolate roast. These flavors all come through in the aroma and combine in a truly unique, very clean, complex, Alt-Bier.... We decided to add the chocolate malt to add a little more complexity to the beer and for a perceived dryness that helps to balance the caramel malty flavor. ""

I agree with that both objectively and subjectively. The individual flavors are familiar, but the combination and arrangement here is totally unique. The use of the chocolate malt combined with the hops make for a good balance and overall taste. I even detect some citrus in the classic West Coast style. 

Drinkability: While not a refreshing beer per se, Hangar 24 Alt-Bier is a quaffable one for sure. The mouthfeel is on the fuller side, with a smooth texture but retains a crisp, well-carbonated body and smooth finish. The aftertaste is fairly clean, if not a little sweet. At 6% ABV its right on the money as far as where it should be in terms of weight and efficiency. I drank mine a little too quickly.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1434,"2010-03-01",3.4,"On tap at the brewery: Clear copper amber with a thin-lacing off-white head.  Toasty caramel and sweet malty nose with some noble hoppy character.  Starts with pretty good fullness and light caramely maltiness with a good noble hop balance, but could use some more dark caramel malts and light chocolate character.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Flavor is the nose, caramel forefront, with a touch of roasted wood near the finish to balance the sweetness. Good, but nothing special and a litle one-dimensional on the caramel.","Littleton, Colorado, USA","alagnak"

Ok so I realize something but I had this on tap at Live Wire its awesome getting there early and we could get tables, we could have reserved them all but were content with 2.  Pours dark brownish with a brown.  Nose is sweet and not bad for an alt.  So I agreed to get this as a Birthday gift out for me because it was the most notable not rated beer on tap.  Taste is sweet malty and tasty on the whole as a whole  a pretty good alt a style I hate","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
