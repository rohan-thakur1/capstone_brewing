911,"2017-06-16",2.0,"Clear copper brew with nice head and a herbal aroma. Taste is hops up front, citrus, spicy, then a hit of the caramel malts. Its OK but not great as I would have expected for the higher price tag. Well looking at the cost I would not only have expected better taste but also a higher ABV and for it to be in a proper bottle rather than a cheap CAN. So overall not good.","Temple, Texas, USA","dlihcsnatas"

The flavor leans bready sweet the whole time. Quick bready sweet aftertaste running into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable smooth crisp sweet feel rolling along my tongue. Feels super smooth all around.
Overall, really good Cali common. I dont see any dates anywhere but Im suspecting this might have a little bit of age to it given that its so smooth.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

911,"2016-05-01",3.2,"355ml can bought at HK Brewcraft in Central.
Looks: Clear amber honey colour; One finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with notable slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragment full Ale malt, with very light passion fruits, light candied fruits, very light dark fruits, floral, honey, bread, yeast and light lemon.

Taste: Close to medium sweet Vienna-like malt, with light caramel, very light red fruits, light floral, molasses, dry biscuits, light yeast, light lemon, quite strong bitter hops and sharp grass. 

Body: Mid to full body. Slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong Vienna-like Amber maltyness in a rich and very smooth background with very distinct Bock-ish taste. Caramel and red fruit are light. Sweetness is moderate. Dry-ish with strong lemony hops to round. Good!

Hoppiness: Very light tropical fruits, light candied fruits, floral, honey and light lemon in nose. Light floral, light lemon and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, mid-to-high astringent sweet-bitter finish.

After Taste: Very dry. Sweet, biscuity and bitter to mouth.
Comments: This one has good looks, rather underwhelming tropical fruit aroma, and pretty sweet taste. Yet the malty German Pils dryness and quite sharp bitterness kinda save the day with fairly balanced sweet bitterness. Drinkable, but I wish the dry-hopped aroma could be stronger.

The taste is lagery where the experience starts off with modest smooth sweet malts that run quickly into lightly roasted malts and mineral notes.

Moderate amount of pine/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, caramel, light toffee, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy hops, fruity yeast, and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness as well. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and creamy/bready/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy California common style.

Aftertaste shows a little of the caramel, some toffee, earth, light hops and the strongest by far is the nutty malt with not much of a complexity.

A - Looks nice. It pours with an amber-orange body thats clear with a large amount of visible carbonation. A generous size, creamy, bone-colored head sits on top and proves to be durable. 

Aroma - More hoppy than malty, with hints of citrus fruits, biscuits, and a touch of floral elements. 

Flavor - Clean, with more dominant bready malts, but with hops adding some nice fruity and spicy notes. Excellent complexity for a fairly mild lager. 

Mouthfeel - A very smooth mouthfeel, albeit crisp and with medium-high carbonation. Medium body; dry finish.

911,"2015-09-11",4.1,"Bottle from We Brought Beer in Balham. Steam Beer is my favorite nostalgic go to craft beer. One of the first I drank and since then its always been a regular for me. Always interesting to get this new hopped versions of classics. Saison Dupont and Duvel have done it very well and Im pleased to say Anchor have really nailed it. It drank a regular steam beer to compare the different. Colour is the same clear caramel light brown beer with an off white foam head. Nose is the usual earthy hop, Autumn leaves, pine, caramel, but the spices have gone up a few notches and theres a bit of sherbert and sweetness coming through too. On the taste you get the dry hops and its really really nice. Caramel is still there giving the beer backbone, but the Autumn leaf, earthiness, spice, pine, and that sherbertiness is there. Its basically Steam Beer dialed up to 11 and I really like it. Hasnt lost any balance at all, and has a nice spicy, earthy, herbal, sherberty dry hop kick which for me shades it over the regular version. I think the body is also a bit more full than the regular. Hope they keep making this! Will have to stock a few more. On the finish theres some really nice lingering earthy, dry, pine, Autumn leaves and sherbert.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

Pretty much what youd expect a Steam-hopped beer to be: easily drinkable, and not very memorable. If I lived in San Francisco (or wherever this stuff flows like water), and I had few choices, Id happily drink this regularly and not think about it once.

PS. The artwork on the can is amazing.","Ithaca, New York, USA","Changed"
911,"2015-09-06",3.9,"Anchor Brewing out of San Francisco was one of Americas first true craft breweries (well before that term was coined). Theyre best known for their trademarked Anchor Steam beer  which is an interesting lager/ale hybrid. Ive always found it to be okay, but nothing special. This edition, the Brotherhood Steam Beer is a modernizing of the recipe with plenty of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. Is it any wonder I like it better than the original?

I poured a 12oz can into a mug. There was no freshness date. It cost $3.25 ($0.29 per ounce).

Appearance: Beautiful copper color; quite clear with tiny, slow carbonation bubbles visible. Pours to an average-sized, white, soapy head which retains laces pretty well.

Smell: Lovely hop aroma with notes of pine, grass and perhaps a touch of mint or some herbal character.

Taste: While I wouldnt say this beer is absolutely wonderfully delicious, I will say that it is well-balanced with plenty of hop and malt character that create for an interesting dynamic, but also complement each other. Similar to a Vienna lager, theres a nice taste of the amber malts here; they create for a lightly sweet caramel and bready flavor. Lingering in the background is a mild zesty taste of grassy hops and a firm bitterness. On the back end the hops become much more prominent and even bite a little. Pine needles and a light kiss of mint are noticeable. It might not sound like a good combination, but they actually play off the malt base nicely. This is much more interesting than Anchors flagship steam beer  I hope they make this a perennial offering and not just a one-off.

Drinkability: The thing about steam beers (a.k.a. California Commons) is that they tend to have the taste of ale but the body of a lager. Brotherhood Steam Beer is a bit bigger in body than the average lager, but maintains the consistent carbonation and accompanying crispness of a lager. The hops actually linger for a bit and leave a slight starchy sensation. I would not call this beer refreshing, but it easy very easy to drink quickly. At 5.6% ABV this is strong enough to stand up to a meal, but still light enough to tempt you into sessioning it.

The middle has a little cereal malt sweetness, which balances well. Finishes with more of an herbal moderate hop bitterness. This is a really well-crafted beer. Damn, its good.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
911,"2015-03-22",3.8,"Pours a dirty gold; nearly clear. Modest head that leaves some streaky spots on the glass.

Plenty of West Coast hop aroma--grapefruit rind and a touch of pine. Light malt base to the nose.

Interesting complexity: This one starts off with a malt base that succumbs to the aforementioned hop bitterness. But I also detect a bit of fruity sweetness in the swallow, yet the aftertaste is bitter and long lasting. Leans to the full body side, good carbonation. Easy to drink.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"
911,"2015-03-20",3.6,"Pours a finger and half of head on medium straw body.
The aroma is grain and caramel.
The taste is quite malty with a bitter finish.
The texture is smooth.
Enjoyable.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"

911,"2015-03-05",3.2,"Kinda plain, I think the hoppiness has faded out of this one by now, but not a bad beer.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
911,"2015-02-28",3.3,"On draft at Tap 25. It pours a rich gold/copper penny color with an off white head. The aroma has some mild tea leaves, fruit candy and berries. The flavor is prickly with light caramel, tea leaves, hints of menthol, florals and fruit candy. Bready finish. Its decent, but Im not noticing any more hop aroma than the regular steam beer.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
911,"2015-02-27",3.0,"Pour out of 12 oz can, hazy orange pour with white head, aroma brought notes of biscuit, earth, grass, some herbal notes into some grain, slight yeast. Taste was grass, pear, touch of earth, slight grain and husky notes into some biscuit, toast, finishing sweet, dry.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
911,"2015-02-15",3.5,"A tough beer to rate. It would be a lot better if not dominated by a fruit yeastiness characteristic of all anchor beers. A rather tame beer as well for my taste, but this is supposed to be a drinkable somewhat quenching concert beer and for that it is kind of tasty.","New York, USA","phikus01"
911,"2015-02-14",3.6,"12 ounce can. Orange copper color. Citrus throughout over a malty body with some caramel. Nose isnt there. Slight sweetness. Nice.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"

911,"2015-02-11",2.5,"Didnt quite care for it. Has a bit of a funky aftertaste but I appreciate the effort.","louisville, Kentucky, USA","bubblehouse"
911,"2015-02-10",2.2,"From a can unto a Coos Light cold activated glass. Pours an amber brown with lots of frothy white head. Not much aroma. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Taste is pretty blech. Like a generic amber ale with no flavor. Pretty bad.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"
911,"2015-01-27",3.4,"Can from PUBR. Pours clear dark straw and highly effervescent with 1-finger off-white head. Nose is resiny hoppy, caramel malty. Tastes hoppy, caramel malty, crisp finish, more tart late.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
911,"2014-12-04",3.6,"Pint pour of moderate amber with full light off white head. Nose is biscuited malt and sharpness with mild hop notes. Flavor is malt forward, clean hop notes and biscuit. Fresh an clean, honestly, its pretty good.","Florida, USA","tricyclist"
911,"2014-11-11",3.7,"Comes out of the tap a beautiful amber with a fairly thick white head. Aroma has firm malty and fruity notes. Flavor is mainly malty with a nice fruity underpinning. Mouthfeel has average thickness but good, strong fizz. Join this brotherhood!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
911,"2014-11-06",3.4,"Tap at 4th ave pub. Pours orange with small head. Nose is light hop and grain. Tastes of hop bitters, lemon, fiddele heads, grains, some other dried herbs. Crisp and smooth. A fine drinking common","New York, USA","Jow"
911,"2014-11-03",3.6,"2oz taster on tap, at HopCat Broad Ripple. Clear golden slight orange color. Thin off-white head, leaving good thicker sheets of lace. Medium body. Smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Bread, hint of honey (?), biscuity malt, and a nice balanced amount of dry hop, works very well with the base. Moderate sweet, mild to moderate bitter. Tasty, easy-drinking balanced stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
911,"2014-10-24",3.3,"The Sampler, Brooklyn tap: Pours amber with a whitish head. Aroma some hops, but nearly not as much as I expected when the citra banner was raised. Taste was slightly sweet. A little malty. Some earthiness. The hops didnt play nearly as much of a part as I though they would. Some tropical fruit flavors going down I suppose. Mint? I dont think so.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
911,"2014-10-02",3.6,"Draft at Stragelove. Slightly hazy pale orange copper pour that starts with an impressive large white frothy head. Scattered lace. Complex toasted malts. Feels nicely unfiltered. Buttered biscuits with a floral marmalade. Orange peels. Lemon thyme. Dandelions. Violet petals. Apricots. Bubble gum. Honey bamboo. Eccentric toasted wheat notes. Interesting enough though the body feels a tad more watery than juicy.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"
911,"2014-08-09",3.2,"Tap at Lazy Dog. Pours a transparent amber with a thin layer of off white head. Taste and aroma of caramel, malts, and bitter citrus.","Warner Robins, Georgia, USA","JHeath99"
911,"2014-08-01",3.8,"On tap at Joe Canals West Deptford.
Appearance: The body is clear with an amber hue, leaning slightly dark. The head is creamy and light tan.
Aroma: Fruity and malty. Big caramel and semi-sweet white wine with hints of cherry. Reminds me a little of a oaked chardonnay.
Taste: Mildly bitter with balanced flavors. Underlying caramel with white wine overlying, hints of grapefruit and cherry. Finish lingers a tad medicinal of cherry and caramel.
Palate: Full-bodied and crisp.
Overall: This is a great drinking beer. One I could put back a bunch of without thinking! What a nice beer.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
