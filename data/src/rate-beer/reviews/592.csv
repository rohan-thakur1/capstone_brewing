592,"2015-10-04",3.1,"12 oz. bottle from shrubber85 - thanks again, Roger! Bottle dated best by 3/24/16. Pours a deep but clear mahogany with a small khaki head that lasts as a sloppy ring and uneven, bubbly film. Aroma of sweet cookie, brown and toasted sugar, caramel, toast, dead leaves, figs, dates, raisins, biscuit, and a woody, earthy note. Flavor of dead leaves, cookie, fruitcake, toasted sugar, caramel, candied nuts, figs, raisins, dates, and earth. Pretty light bodied, actually, with moderate to medium carbonation and a dry, sweet, earthy mouthfeel. DrSilverworm sure hated this one. Its not bad. Its a bit too sweet, but its dry and earthy and relatively easy sipping for the style. I wouldnt want a pint, but a few ounces makes for a decent serving.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Very vinous up front, with some mild cherry, earth, and tobacco. Some vegetable. Some caramel. Kind of astringent bigger bitter taste. bigger sweet, bit of heat on the end. Sort of a mild bite. Kind of has an oxidized sort of taste to it. Medium to bigger body. Lighter carbonation. Kind of slick. Bit dry in the finish. Impossible to take more than tiny sips. Gets worse as it goes. Something seems wrong here. Very sweet, astringent, very not enjoyable, did not finish.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

I used to not be an Ale Asylum fan either, even though they are just down the road. But this is really impressive - - I like aged dubbels, but the freshness is super - - the roasty malts to start are delicately warming and sweet, and then things start to really zoom with a huge range of spice / hop / precious-metal complexity, Every sip is a gothic cathedral spire.

Initial is deeper and darker, red fruit with cherries, a touch of poimegranate moving into sweet caramel, toffee, brown sugar. Some light Belgian Candi sugar, yeasty spice. More spicy, some estery banana and pear come into the fold. A solid Dubbel, a bit estery and yeasty. Id prefer some darkness.. Chocolate or more deeper malts. Still, not bad. By the book..

Lovely.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

592,"2006-06-26",3.8,"Growler courtesy of the Madison triumvirate.  Hazy, light and murky caramel brown in color.  Spicy hot caramel-glazed, fried chocolate bananas commandeer the nose.  Nutmeg and cinnamon meet with a sugary, peppered ginger crème, along with cocoa sprinkled on banana bran breakfast cereal.  Later on we get a mild accent of wet birch and rubber.  Oily spiced stream comes in with a dry, cocoa powder flavor and feel.  Banana bran reintroduces itself with a lightly toasted caramel cushion.  Ginger, nutmeg and a tantalizing banana-chocolate crème brûlée parallel.  Loses a little bit of speed near the end, pulling some attributes from cocoa bubblegum.  Chocolate puffs and mild green skinned plantains give an ample track to a well-balanced beer, but there seems to have been not enough patience to let this one gel in the conditioning phase of its construction.  Nutmeg and caramel macchiatos surmise the finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

This was the third sample of ten tried in a row.  Initially mistaken for the   Happy Ending, we quickly realized our mistake after the next sample.  This is   the star of the Ale Asylum lineup.  If you can only choose one beer from their   tap list when you visit make it this one.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep amber body presented itself with a rich   bouquet of oranges, mango, white wine and a general fruitiness I could not   quite pin down.  It made me excited about what was to come, which is where   the real fun begins.

Flavor / Palate - A sweet alcoholic first wave gave way to fruity   notes that were not unlike a blend of apples, pears, bananas and mangos.   Mixed in with that were honey and caramel notes.  The alcohol is palateable but    despite burning does not overwhelm the senses.  This is an extremely full bodied beer   that was very enjoyable.  At $3.50 a pint this one is a steal for what you get - one    of the best beers in the Madison area.  As I mentioned earlier, if you can only get   one beer make it this one.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
592,"2006-06-02",4.1,"Aroma is bright, with caramel, toasted bread, raisins and a touch of spice.  Cloudy amber-brown with a thin, off-white head.  Complex flavors of grape, caramel, sweet bread, chocolate and a spicy finish. Sweet, but nice and dry with a crisp and thin body.  This was the star of the night in my opinion. Ill have it again for sure.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
