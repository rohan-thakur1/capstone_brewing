There is a light sweetness to it up front, and the roasty malt just catches up. There is a strong maltiness toward the back and its not too shabby, there just isnt a lot happening.

1659,"2016-09-09",3.8,"Classically conceived dry stout from one of the well-respected Californian craft beer pioneers; ingredients list literally says ""water, barley, malt, hops, yeast and thats all"", as if they want to make a statement against all those more recent, trendy stouts with special flavorings added... I like the design, almost looks like a classic English bottle and label, like most of North Coasts bottles. Thick, frothy, beaten egg-like, yellowish hued head leaving a thick coating of membranous lacing all around, blackish appearance but actually a very deep purple-hued bronze, completely translucent (but hardly so and under bright light). Aroma of cold black coffee, coffee beans even, fairly subtle bitter chocolate, soaked bayleaf, beef stock cubes, burnt branches, leather, liquorish candy, mocha, faintly sweetish aromas of horse steak, unripe elderberries, tomato concentrate and stewed white beans, in warming up even something vaguely sweet sherry-like. Soft, initially somewhat neutral onset, shyly revealing dried fruit sweetishness paired with equally subtle umami (beef stock but only vaguely so), underlying roasted barley sourishness pulling things forward to a pleasantly rounded, nutty and toasted bittersweet malt core, gaining confidence in the end with a coffeeish roasted bitterness filling the mouth cavity; under soft carbonation, the mouthfeel is slick and smooth, but full and pleasant, just right for a stout at session strength. Spicy, even slightly tonic water-like hop bitter notes reinforce the roasted bitterness in the end, but that rounded, sweetish, nutty flavor lingers just as well. Dry stout alright, still carrying sweetness to give it balance and rotundity - this is a very appetizing example of its style. Fairly classic in comparison with so many younger West Coast craft breweries, North Coast is still a resounding name for its historical influence alone, and still delivers consistent quality in its (relatively speaking) classically designed beers - not unlike Sierra Nevada, I reckon.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1659,"2014-10-12",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 3-12-14-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer almost pitch black deep-deep brown color with a one finger head of a cream color. The head has a good level of retention, sitting around for some time before fading to leave a nice level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of a nice roasted malt smell with dark chocolate and a notes of coffee. Some light smells of vanilla and caramel are mixed in with the darker and roasted aromas producing a somewhat semi-sweet chocolate bar like smell.

 Taste  The taste begins a bit sweeter than the nose would have let on with some vanilla and brown sugar sweetness mixed with a nice roasted flavor. A little bit of chocolate is upfront as well, but this remains relatively light throughout the taste. In opposition to the chocolate, the coffee begins very light but increases quite a bit as the flavors advance, becoming the dominant darker flavor toward the end of the flavor profile. With the coffees increase in intensity, the bitterness of the beer increases as well, and with a slight increase in the sweetness, due to a bit of a cola flavor coming to the tongue at the end of the taste, one is left with a bitter-sweet, dark roasted coffee flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker side for a brew of 5.6 % abv. with a slightly lower carbonation level. The slightly thicker body and lower carbonation are great for the darker flavors of the brew all while not being too low or too thick to keep it from being drinkable.

 Overall  A nice Irish stout. Not the driest out there in terms of its sweetness but a very nice and easy drinker none the less. Very enjoyable.","","Darkmagus82"

A: Pours a very dark brown color. The head is a three finger tan color with good retention and lacing. It doesnt have the beauty of Guinness, but as the old saying goes, looks aint everything...

S: I really like the subtle chocolate notes this give off, but I also smell a light fruitiness from the esters alongside the typical roast. Not much coffee on the nose, but still a good smell.

T: This has a bit of a milk stout vibe to it, with its lactic twang and light milk chocolate notes intertwining with its roasty base. Just like in the smell, this could use a little more coffee. The back end of the flavor profile sees hints of fruitiness pop up. Not insanely complex, but well balanced and very likable.

1659,"2012-07-06",4.3,"The odd experience with the Anchor Porter did make me somehow uneasy about what to expect from the Californian Old No. 38 Stout. But those two were just like water and wine. And Sicilian wine, for that matter: fortified Marsala. Exactly what comes out to start with, so delicious with the aroma of this Old No. 38: Port, Dry Sherry, but most specifically, Marsala. Its a fabulous beer! Beautiful mocha head. Not sure if theres still any Exxon Valdez on the North Coast, but the persisting foam does have a suggestion of brine and tar, which blend just perfectly with the roasted malt flavours, chocolate notes and raisin overtones of Medoncino grapes. Not a hint of cannabis though. So far this North Coast stout is the best American stout I have had.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"

Solid, compact and tight dollop of tannish cream rests there for the length to leave a very fine lace.

Firm, meaty body, very smooth in back and oily finish with a light spritz to tickle the tip of the tongue. Bitter/sweet dark chocolate dominates, good lot of smoke, wood and peat comes through as does a cheeky showing of earthy, herbal, almost Noble hops.Very well balanced.

Overflowing with caramel, currants, and raisins. Very smooth on the palate and a bit sweeter than expected as there is a flavor of burnt marshmallows. The hops come in late and are not particularly strong, but just enough to cut the sweetness before it gets cloying. Charred woods comes to the forefront as it warms. The dry finish also becomes more noticeable.

Overall, another very impressive brew from North Coast. It takes a bit to get used to all the fruit notes, but the charred and toasted character along with peppery hops lead to a very nice balance. Pick this up when you find it!","Elida, Ohio, USA","mcnealc31"

1659,"2011-05-16",3.7,"Bottle - Its the end of a long 4-day weekend spent with the wife and kids. It was fun, but Im absolutely spent, and need a little alone time. Looking in the fridge, I just want something smooth and flavorful--nothing challenging. Old No. 38 it is--Im hoping this tastes like I imagine it does. Pours deep and dark, with a foamy light tan head. The smell is what I hoped for--chocolate and coffee notes with roast that is pungent but not too bitter or overpowering. Its on the dry side, but with a bit of sweetened condensed milk to lighten things up. The first sip--yep, thats what I was looking for. Reminds me of New Glarus Coffee Stout. Good balance between roast, coffee/chocolate, and milky sweetness. The carbonation bites a bit much, but otherwise is pretty full-bodied and smooth. Finishes with the slightest hint of bourbon, though it gets a little watery right in the middle of the sip. This is nothing ground-breaking, but its solid and exactly what I was looking for tonight.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

The aroma is where this beer shines. The dark fragrant roasts and strong coffee aroma just powerful.

The taste is not shabby either with very refined with hints of espresso and notes of sour cream.  The dark roasted barley fills this beer with slight burnt finish that is pleasant when matched with the other flavors going on. The malts are prevalent, but the hops are not lost in the final judgment.

1659,"2010-05-23",3.6,"Tasting portion at a North Coast beer tasting event at a local grocery store. Poured into a champagne flute glass. The beer rep from North Coast indicated that the philosophy of the brewer was to make beers that closely resemble the style guidelines for that type of style (i.e., to make the perfect beer for that style), and that Old 38 was a fine example of that philosophy for the dry Irish stout. Dark & black in color, with a nice foamy head. Deep aromas of roasted malts and coffee. I pick up that sweet Irish whiskey like flavor that you typically find in Irish stouts, along with some coffee flavors. The beer finishes with burnt toast sensation and somewhat dry. A little light bodied for a stout, but thats likely typical for this style. Creamy and low levels of carbonation. Well balanced, smooth and light bodied stout.

Pours a very dark brown, near black, with a small brown head that fades quickly and leaves a thin tan film on the beer and rim on the edge.  Aroma of dark fruits (prunes, fig, raisins, plum), chocolate, barley malts, and coffee.  The flavor didnt do as much for me, was just too muted.  Notes of dried and dark fruits- same ones listed above- that provide some sweetness and a little tart note, along with malts, chocolate, nuts, and yeast.  Medium bodied, with a dry, light palate.  With more body, the palate would be really nice because of the complexity of the flavors.  Quick, dry, roasty finish, with dried fruits.  After a few seconds, leaves the palate really dry.

1659,"2009-12-05",3.8,"Thoroughly enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass.  The beer pours a nearly jet black color, with a small and relatively quickly disappearing light tan head.  Low to moderate carbonation, which is positioned just about right between an English pub ale and an APA.  Notes of caramel, bready malt, prunes, and cherries dipped in chocolate come through in the aroma.  Very inviting, and perhaps evidence of not only the recipe, but also a careful hand with selecting a proper English yeast strain.  There are also some almost acidic and sour characteristics, but they are somewhat restrained by the darker more roasty notes.  The palate is surprisingly light across the mouth, but certainly not insipid.  A complex interplay of the bready/biscuity characteristics of Maris Otter base malt, paired with some caramel, a dose of chocolate, and then the aforementioned dark fruity/slightly sour character.  The finish is semi-sweet a bit roasty, leaving the yeasts character to dance on the palate for a few moments.  Overall, extremely interesting, unique, and well-crafted.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

1659,"2008-09-13",3.8,"Yet another outstanding beer from North Coast Brewing. While I haven’t had North Coasts entire portfolio, everything that I have drank so far has been absolutely divine.

Old No. 38 pours a rich velvety black with a thin layer of cappuccino colored foam on top which slowly fades into a ring around the edge of my stout glass. Toasty malts, chocolate, and nuts greet my nose before slaking my thirst as I take my first quaff. A very smooth, creamy mouthfeel full of rich, dry dark chocolate, sweet toasty malts, and a hint of nuts. A very dry stout, each quaff leaves a nice arid bitterness throughout. A good example of the classic dry stout which Guinness has made famous. As I swirl my glass to release more vapors and nose, a rich cappuccino head forms each time, keeping the nose and palate alive. Old No. 38 has a light lemon bitter bite near the back, but it is the dark chocolate, nuts, and malts which rain supreme. A full body, but pleasantly light and easy to drink. A bit more into my beer, I notice some raisin notes in the nose and palate. A pleasant addition to the overall well-balanced flavor profile. As I finish Old No. 38, I am left with a pleasantly mild dry sensation, lingering dark chocolate, malts, and nuts rounding into a mild bitter lemon nip.

For a dry stout, I would rate Old No. 38 from North Coast right up there with Guinness, if not a bit better. A delectable delight and a perfect pairing for some cool seafood fare such as fresh clams or oysters.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1659,"2008-06-16",4.0,"Metaphorically speaking, this seems to be the younger and smaller brother to North Coasts Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout. Some of the same basic characteristics are present, such as the coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, brown sugar, et cetera, but without that profound eye-opening flavor and high alcohol content. Also considerably watery compared to the Old Razz. Other than that it is excellent. And by excellent I mean that this would be the premier beer for most breweries, thats how good it is. Yet in this case it plays 2nd fiddle to the virtuosic Old Rasputin. Either way, you cant lose, as everything North Coast touches turns to gold.","California, USA","Gypsy19"

The beer pours a non-viscous black-red, with abundant cumulus-like head formation which had pretty good vitality.  Aroma was pretty minimal, but offered a small quantity of roastiness.  Flavor was very roasty and dry, like having a mouthful of cinders, which for me is a good thing.  Mouthfeel was clean but a bit thin.

1659,"2007-08-12",3.5,"Pours a burgundy-brown with a creamy tan head that has some staying power. On the nose are: dark roasted malts, cocoa, and molasses. Simple but nice. Medium-bodied yet thin in the mouthfeel it finishes with some hop bitterness, a refreshing change from most of the dry stouts that Ive sampled. The flavor is of dark roasted almost burnt malt, coffee, a touch of chocolate and a nicely bitter hoppy finish. Many dry stouts finish bitter from the aggressive roasting of the malts and a burnt, dry finish. Old No. 38 does possess some of those flavors, which make it difficult to pull out any distinctly hoppy flavors, but the bitterness of this finish is more of the ""squeeze"" you get at the back of the tongue rather than a characteristic of its flavors.

The sourness has a grainy and coarse quality which makes it tolerable, reminiscent of sourdough bread.  Tastes both old, and old fashioned.  A metallic tone surfaces.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that looked black in the glass, but showed red highlights when held to the light. It had a large tan head that mostly lasted. The aroma was moderate to heavy roasted, dark chocolate and mild coffee malts and lightly hoppy. The initial flavor was lightly bitter with coffee and chocolate, while the finish was lightly sweet and moderately to heavily bitter with something like burnt toast of an average duration.

Initially the combination of smoke, coffee and roasted barley made me think that this one might be a real sleeper hit, however as it opened up it lost steam.

1659,"2006-11-05",3.6,"Pours with a frothy, three finger thick, brown tainted, tan colored head the leaves a light lacing pattern on the sides of the glass.  The beer itself is a almost black color with a brownish tint to it.  The aroma smells softly of dark grain and burnt raisins.  A light roast grain tartness hangs around towards the end of the aroma along with black coffee aromatics and heavily toasted malt notes.  In the middle there is a soft, sweet, dark chocolate note that helps to mellow out the other more roasted notes.

The beer starts out soft and creamy with a mouth coating quality to it, but the carbonation quickly adds a zippy note that tends to balance this out.  Finishes with a burnt grain and hop bitterness as well as a black acidity.  Sweetish, dark malt notes intermingle with chocolate and a sweetened espresso character never quite balancing out the dominant dry roasted grain notes.  This beer strikes a light crispness up front despite the color, yet in the finish has a mouth coating creaminess to it that adds to a perception of heft.

All in all this is a great beer to sit down with over a couple pints.  Light and quaffable, yet at the same time chewy and interesting.  If I had to perfect this I would add a touch more chocolate and sweet malt notes to balance the roast acidity, but then it would not be nearly so quaffable.

Aroma: Roasted malts and chocolate with berry underneath.  A sugary sweet scent.
Appearance:  A truly beautiful milk chocolate brown with red tinges in color with a head of light beige bubbles that laced and sustained nicely throughout the glass.  I did not think this would be the case after the pour as there was not much head present but I was presently surprised by the final result.  There was a small amount of sediment present that floated and settled but it was not enough to consider as much of a downgrade.
Flavor: Started lightly sweet chocolate and caramel with the roasted malts mingling nicely.

Pours like a dark cola with little head but beautiful ruby highlights low in the glass. Dark roasted whole grains dominate the nose; the flavor is very dry, with black coffee as the prominant flavor, only the sort of black coffee that you get at hour six of a nine hour flight, having started with less than the best of beans, having been brewed under less than ideal conditions, and having spent three or more hours bubbling away on a hot plate. That said, I do get a decent if subtle hint of raspberry liquor in there as well; I may not want raspberry syrup in my coffee but it complements nicely in this particular beer .

This is an exceptional domestic version of an Irish classic. Without a doubt one of the best domestic versions of this style being brewed today. This beer would work well with a number of dishes.

1659,"2005-03-11",3.3,"2004 bottle at the Downtown liquors Stout tasting, 3/10/05.  Dark brown colored body, nearly opaque and low carbonation to boot.  Lightly creamy head is an ashen-beige color, low retention.  Smells of sticky, salty toffee and caramel, light peanuts and chocolate as well.  Flavor shows off more caramel and chocolate, with a good chewy malt texture, no carbonation interuption.  But the body is a bit thin, even for a dry stout (and this isnt all that dry).  Hops are quite apparent, though not overdone, and impart a floral, almost minty bitterness (mint flavored hot chocolate anyone?), with a light, sticky resin note as well.  A tinge of sourness coming from somewhere and Im not getting all the intense coffee that everyone else mentions.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A bit shallow in the body flavor (robustness) department, but I suppose thats part of the ""dry"" in the dry stout nomenclature.

Large roasted coffee with some cocoa, plums, toasted nuts, grain and light bitter hops.  Very clean palate, with a slight coffee stickiness, but does play on the border of watery.

For a beer out of a bottle and no widget, it looks a hell of a lot like a cask beer, only without the cascading effect.  Slightly bitter coffee aroma with some malt.  Its a strange mix of bitter and sweet.  That continues on into the taste.  It fights back and forth between being dry and/or bitter, versus a sweet kick.  Good coffee and roasted barley, both in amounts that let you know they are there but not so much that its all you taste.  Damn fine stout, a new favorite!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

The aroma is that of high maltiness, sweetness, coffee and something between mocha and chocolate. The taste begins with a malty jolt, followed by the subtle coffee and powerful chocolate jolts, (and those roasted subtleties are just great) and ends with a bitterness from those fine but thinly spread hops...a good dry bitterness.

1659,"2002-11-02",3.4,"<P>The head is reluctant to form and once it does form has trouble lasting. What remains of the head clings to the sides of the glass like a 12-year-olds at their first dance. The body is a bit pale for a stout. Instead black with light seeping only through the edges, light passes relatively easily through this beer making is less black and more blackened ruby. The first thing I caught on my first whiff was a shock of citric hops that didnt seem to mesh well with the chocolately dark malt. I tried again and the hop aromas died down until after a few minutes all they were was a suggestion of bittereness lurking beneath the sweet malt. The flavor is moderately sweet and far from dry. I wouldnt describe it as rich, but I would call it chocolatey with low bitterness. There are few coffee or other bittering flavors from the darker roasted malt, although a lighter crisper malt lurks underneath the chocolate. Sadly, the mouthfeel is very thin for a stout. Of course that also makes it unusually drinkable for a stout. Still the flavor could benefit from a richer body and the mouthfeel really shouldnt so thin.

<P>My final verdict is that for a stout its only run of the mill. It has some high points, like the fairly complex and lush flavor and aroma, and while a little too transparent for what I like in a stout, the resulting color is quite attractive. But it also has low points, like the thin mouthfeel and wimpy head. Despite all this, for pure easy-drinking pleasure, its not a bad beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

1659,"2002-02-24",2.7,"this is a transparent stout, (imposter!) perhaps needing to be downgraded to a porter. okay, i dont pretend to know the mechanics of style, maybe i just need a fatter glass. the aroma is certainly robust. my scent-association impressions were mixed: burnt rubber, molasses and graham cracker--if theres any chocolate there its the leftover cocoa husks. id say its a very bitter hoppy stout, and tho its way better than a poke in the eye, i think ill curl my lip downward the next time someone asks: what about this one?!","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
1659,"2002-02-17",3.8,"My review may be a bit biased because this tastes IDENTICAL to a homebrew I recently made.  Imagine my shock when I bought something that tasted just like what I made myself.  Anyhow, the dark flavors are apparent, nutty, roasty, slightly sweet followed by a bitter finish.  I dont know about these guys, but I used Cascade hops in mine.  Medium bodied with light carbonation so it goes down smooth.  Hops and roastiness linger.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
1659,"2002-02-16",3.6,"Very dark in color but a thin, short-lived head when poured.  Aroma is of dark malt with some coffee-like sweetness from caramel or molasses.  First sip did remind me of Guinness but it is much thinner in body, and a little too light on the palate.  The bitter finish is a nice complement to the sweetness, though, so I dont mind the light body.  It reminded me of a hoppy version of Salvator, strange but ok nevertheless.  So far I like what Ive had from North Coast.","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"

1659,"2001-12-08",3.2,"Thin in body with a sourness that is not checked by roastiness, malty sweetness or hops, so it takes over. There are many better options out there.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

1659,"2001-12-05",4.3,"Ya know, I dont want to give anyone the wrong impression about this beer, but Im not sure of what I think of it.  It truly reminds me of the Guinness extra stout we all grew up on, but milder and thinner, much thinner. Actually, I held it up to the light to see if was a thin looking as it is tasting. This is a perfectly good stout and will win you a friend or two, but there are more interesting stouts out there, many of them in fact.","Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, USA","TheDarkertheBetter99"

1659,"2001-10-16",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2003 The key word here seems to be 'coffee'.  Dark brown color with light brown head that dissipates quickly.  Strong hop and coffee nose with maltiness evident in the background.  Very astringent coffee flavors with dark chocolate notes and some sweetness up front.  Very bitter aftertaste, but with intense flavors throughout. Good quality stout, especially if you are a coffee lover.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

1659,"2001-08-19",3.7,"Dark brown and reddish, with a thick frothy head. Surprisingly light mouthfeel, malty aroma, with a hoppy/malty taste. Overall roasty/burnt quality, not bad, but I have had better.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
1659,"2001-08-16",3.9,"Number 200! I enjoyed this more than their Rasputin. Inviting coffee and sugar aroma, hinting at the underlying hops.  A bit fizzy, the coffee flavor seems to touch every taste bud on the tongue, and finishes with a nice, mellow hop bitterness.  This beer is rich, almost too rich, and somewhat edgy. A small amount of refinement would make this an excellent brew.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

1659,"2001-04-27",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2003 The beer pours a quite deep garnet color, the head is initially modest, frothy in texture, but erodes quite quickly leaving a fair to middling sheet of lace to conceal the glass. Light hints of roasted grains and coffee, malt and a pleasant enough nose I guess. Malt and lightly sweet, the top disappointing in its feel, a bit light for this stout lover. Finish is moderately carbonated, the hops adequate, the aftertaste dry. Maybe I should classify it as a beginners stout, certainly most stouts have nothing to fear from this rather Wimpy stout, not bad mind you, just a tad to light for me.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1659,"2001-04-21",3.6,"Fairly light bodied for a stout - more like a porter...even more like a dark lager, (oscura, dunkel, even maybe a schwarzbier?).  It esp had those toffeeish, roasted, burnt flavors found in good German dark lagers.
