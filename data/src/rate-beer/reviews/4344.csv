4344,"2017-02-19",3.8,"Thanks Frank.
Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a deep burnt red color with a nice fingers worth of white foamy head that crept slowly into the beer leaving some subtle concave lace just a rim of it.
The aroma had some caramel malt, lightly roasted, toast and then some sweet pomme-like fruits. Sweet grain.
The flavor had the sweet enriching maltiness flowing back and forth between the grains and malts. Toast to caramel malty enriching aftertaste flows into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionable to sipping quality about it. Moderate carbonation. ABV felt good as is.
Overall, nice English Strong ale worthy of having every winter if I could get it in my distro.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

4344,"2014-04-01",3.4,"Bottle. Pours a hazy darker amber color with a moderate off white head on it. Nose is a little floral and hoppy, though the hops smell like they are on the cusp of turning.

4344,"2012-01-15",4.1,"12oz bottle.  Stained-glass amber-red, with a thin, patchy beige head.  This is quite a great beer, big caramel tones, but even bigger steady piny hop tones.  There is also some alcohol warmth, some vanilla tinged fruity amber malt, and some burnt coffee tones.  Quality ingredients and excellent execution.  This beer makes me want to move to the Northwest.  Excellent.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4344,"2011-12-05",3.3,"Pours medium brown, and has a strong sweet malty aroma. Flavor is robust sweet malt, and the sweetness lingers on the palate. There are carmel and date tones in there to add nice complexity. Finishes with a combination of sweet malt and hop bitterness, but still primarily sweet, almost sticky malt. I like beers along this line, but this one is actually a bit too sweet for me. Almost sugary throughout, so Ill take a pass on this in the future.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"

4344,"2010-03-15",3.7,"Dark amber pour with a thick beige head on it.  Aroma is pretty light: caramel, toast, a little nuttiness.  Tastes very sweet and caramelly initially, has some toasted bread character, and finishes spicy, herbal, and warm.  Fairly bitter and roasty on the finish as it lingers.  This seemed messy at first when I first sipped it, but it really grew on me as I worked through my bottle.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"
4344,"2010-03-10",3.5,"Pours a murky, ruddy brown, with a very thin beige head. The aroma is fruity malts - some berries and cherries - with a nutty note as well. Flavor is like a slightly fruity red ale - plenty of hops to keep it dry, but definitely on the malty side. Lots of roasty caramel, some alcohol burn. Its got a good, full mouthfeel, but its a little sticky and syrupy. Certainly tasty, though.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

4344,"2010-01-28",3.5,"12oz bottle, courtesy of scrizzz. Thanks, Clint! Pours a deep mahogany color; creamy off-white head with good retention and fine-bubbled lacing; a solid pour. Vinous alcohol notes, dried fruit, caramel, and some very light nondescript bitterness in the aroma; overall a malt-forward showing in the nose, but balanced quite pleasantly; hints of alcoholic warmth; really a nice, clear presentation of a winter warmer. Medium-to-full body; average levels of carbonation, but smooth and slightly oily on the palate; quite pleasant mouthfeel overall; lots of caramel and dried fruits (dates, raisins especially) and light vinous character; some appropriately placed citrus acidity and quiet earthy bitterness; again, well-hidden alcohol and just a generous, delicately presented winter warmer. This strikes me as being significantly better put-together than most of the Dicks beers Ive had; excellent, palateable ASA, despite the fact that the flavor profile of these (especially those without a significant hop character) really set my heart aflame. Solid beer. Lengthy finish of dried fruits, caramel, and some earthy bitterness making itself known; balanced ending.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

4344,"2008-12-26",3.8,"From a 12 ounce bottle. I assume it is the 2008 version but there is no date of any kind on the bottle.
Poured crystal clear brown color with no haze. A one finger off-white head from a gentle pour. The lacings start well but eventually just leave traces. Aroma is spicy with some toffee.
Taste is sweet carmelized brown sugar, nutmeg, and earthy bitter hops with a tinge of lemons and orange zest. The alcohol is well masked and listed on the cool ski scene label as 7.5% abv. Mouthfeel is just right and there is a fully bitter effect on the back of the tongue. Plenty dry finish which makes you want another taste. Drinkability is good, almost too good.

The flavor was just like the aroma, full pine and citrus notes, even floral aspects, finishing with a quick hit of caramel and toffee malts, turning back then to a powerfully bitter finish, full bitterness, roasty bitterness mingled under all the hoppy bitterness, odd combination, but interesting.

It is a sweet drink but not candied, kind of a a mellow toffee that really suits this style well as the malt backbone is not upstaged by sugarcane. Nice residual bitterness.

Aroma has a heavy malt sense with a kick of spice hops going on with it.  Small hints of toffee are also snuck in there.  The taste starts off with a nice sweet malt character, which moves into a spicey medium thick body that finishes on a very present hop note that lingers around for a bit.  Bits of caramel are noticable, but over taken by the spice and hops.  Not incredibly complex, but a good drinking and warming winter brew!","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"

4344,"2006-02-10",3.6,"Bottle.  A pretty beer - clear dark red body under a thin but clingy light tan head.  Crazy aroma - smells like chamios, orange blossom honey, and soft brown sugar.  Clean, intense pale malt sweetness in the middle of the flavor thats bounded by spicy alcohol and dandelion-bitter hops.  On top of that is that orange blossom honey again.  The finish is primarly brown sugar-laced cystal malt.  Above-average mouthfeel, lightly sticky feel.  The beer has a big flavor but its just not that well put together.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
4344,"2006-01-10",3.7,"An interesting aroma pervades this beer, like opening an old pine box, jubilant hops jump out and has a menthol-ish alcohol aroma almost like mouthwash.  The flavor is rich and malty with the hops as an afterthought.  This is a big beer, but there just seems to be something missing, it is all over the place.  Strong bitter finish.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"

4344,"2006-01-05",3.7,"With a little help, this beer pours with a frothy, tightly beaded, amber-tinged tan colored head.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, deep ruby-red color.  The aroma has a nice hoppiness to it that is the first thing to jump out at me; I get a nice mix of pine, menthol and an herbal character that might even have a hint of anise to it.  The aroma really has a certain raw green character to it, though not like an over the top IPA.

The beer has a smooth, yet rich, creamy mouthfeel to it up front that is accentuated by a soft caramel-like sweetness.  The finish though has that same raw, green herbal character to it that the aroma has, and it serves as a great foil for the up front malt.  The hops are noticeable throughout a sip, but up front they show an accentuating, lightly herbal, almost fruity note.  It is not until after you have swallowed that they get a bit more aggressive and green;  the finish is solidly bitter with a lingering menthol-like almost pine note.  I really dig the contrast between the up front flavors and the lingering raw finish.

In the end that raw character in the finish may be a bit too much, but only just a tad.  This beer is nice and thick, with a full palate that begs for a contemplative session in front of the fire, while paired with a good book.  On this level, this beer is wonderful example of a Winter Warmer, and I really could not ask for much more.

4344,"2004-10-13",3.9,"I love winter style beers. And I love Dicks beers. Im a very happy camper right now... Best I can do to summerize this in a way most here will understand is an Arrogant Bastard wtih more bite and a less creamy palate.

Pours a dark brown with minimal head and almost no lacing. Its truly lacking here.

Scent is typical for style, though very nice: Malty but more, a nice hop presence to it.

Taste is suprisingly citric. I know it comes from the hops, but the hops arent very present, although the malt is nicely balanced. Hints of coffee and roasted flavors to this as well.

Palate is nicer than what I alluded; creamy with a strong citrus bite. It could use a bit of mineral to it, which would really make this stick. Overall this is quite good and well-worth seeking out.

4344,"2003-01-03",3.5,"I have tentatively labeled this as an American Strong Ale as there is currently new brewer info. on it. It is of a rich, gorgeous mahogany persuasion with a head that settles into the most appealing cream puddle laying brussels lace gently across the glass as it falls. Lovely aroma of english candy malts befitting and english strong ale, but with a richness of honeyed hops. Full flavor that is nicely melded with a candy malt backbone that has not a speck of cloyingness to it and a strong hop fusion. Lasting, unbalanced hop bitter-sourness that is this beers gravest fault. The alcohol is weaved into this beer seamlessly.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
4344,"2002-12-05",3.2,"Cloudy dark red in color with little head. Quite a sweet smell, caramel, vanilla, yeast, a little bubblegum, and hop resin. Sweet roasted malt starts the taste out, followed by a major bite of bitterness, which mellows into a sweet/hoppy/alcohol finish. The bitter flavor balances out the sweetness and just barely prevents cloyingness. The hops are refreshing and make this winter warmer quite drinkable.
