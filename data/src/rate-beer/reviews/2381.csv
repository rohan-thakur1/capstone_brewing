2381,"2014-01-05",3.7,"On tap at the brewery. A - pours a mahogany red with an pronounced egg shell white to light tan head that thins to a light skin with good lacing. S - aromas do not overpower. Some light caramel malts and floral accents stand out. There is a slightly dirty and woody character but not much (appropriate for a beer from this brewery). Faint mustiness and muddled citrus. M - light to medium crisp and slightly oily body with a light to medium palate. T - hops and caramel malts are first. Some distant grapefruit that lingers throughout. Middle introduces some floral notes. Ending is dirty and bitter with some intermittent almonds and citrus. All of the flavors are smooth and mild in this beer and transition without much fanfare.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
2381,"2013-11-03",4.1,"Poured up on tap at Wilderness where it has a clear deep ruby red to amber body that supports a near white head of foam. The aroma is full of hoppy goodness with pine, kind of a grassy resiny slightly earthy note and then roasted malts in the background. The taste comes across with an initial rush of sweet malts and soft yet firm roasted maltiness. It then quickly picks up pine hop flavor and grassiness that grows more and more into pine hop resiny bitterness. This seems to have a bit of a Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale side to it, like a slightly smaller version. I like that. Very nice hoppy Amber.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2381,"2013-10-29",4.0,"Light red pour. Nice hop forward aroma, taste with a very slight bitterness. Not normally a style of beer I drink as I would rather just go for a pale ale, but very well made none the less.

2381,"2013-10-26",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Deep red amber in color with a craggy head. Light malty nose with some graham cracker and toasted almonds. A little nutty roastiness hits first on the taste before a moderate, piney bitterness kicks in. Medium body; dry finish. This might be my least favorite of AZWBCs normal lineup, but its still a nice beer, which should speak volumes on the high quality of the beer these guys brew.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
