2032,"2017-05-07",4.0,"Growler from Frank.
My portion was poured into a mug.
The appearance was a dark brown color with a level foamy white head. Mild stringy lace.
The aroma had some roasty malts, good dose of nuts, some caramel/toffee maltiness, light coffee, and a little bit of dark chocolate. Some leafy hops at the very end - some light bitterness.
The flavor leaned into the roast initially and then created a nice delicate sweet to roasty aftertaste. Smooth sweet and roasty finish.
The feel was about medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt fine.
Overall, damn good brown ale that I would love to have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Oatmeal, toasted malt, and molasses.
Dark brown with a tinge of red, but no head. Taste is malty with a little bitterness and a lite sourness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little creamy. Nice, but its not amazing. It could do with a little more balance.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","dfearnley"
2032,"2013-05-26",3.4,"No idea what this beer was going in. On the nose I was getting tobacco and a coffee vibe but when I tasted it the flavours didnt match the expectaions my nose had set. It was very nutty in the forefront and those flavours I had been expecting on the nose fell well into the background. The mouthfeel was quite thin for my liking otherwise a very solid brew especially for the style.","barrie, Ontario, CANADA","yumyum"
2032,"2013-02-08",3.9,"Mini-growler. Pours a deep, dark amber-brown with an average size long-lasting frothy tan head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma of lightly roasted malt, nuts, notes of chocolate & coffee, vanilla, light leafy hops and a hint of smoke -- lots going on for a Brown Ale. Flavour is toasted malt and leafy hops first followed by nuts, coffee, chocolate and an average bitter finish. Medium+ bodied. Almost creamy mouthfeel. This is a damn good Brown Ale, one of the best Ive had in fact, well done boys!

2032,"2012-12-05",3.9,"In short: A creamy, rich and very flavorful nutty brown ale.  Superior example of the style
How: Growler shared by the man himself at Camping Brewdown 2012.
The look: Brown body topped by a medium beige head.
In long: Nose is surprisingly intense for a brown ale, very very nutty, toasted cereals, tobacco.  In mouth the beer is very full bodied with a creamy pillowy mouthfeel.  Taste has the expected elements of a good brown ale except that the intensity is in-your-face.  Hazelnuts, pecan pie, toasted bread crust, tobacco leafs.  Generously hoppy but not really bitter, the hopping feel juicy-leafy and provides a good balance wash more of the sweetness away.  This is a superior example of a style I usually find uninteresting.  If Community Beer Works can make such a good brown ale I cant wait to see what they will do with more interesting styles.  A very good grolwer shared by the brewer/owner himself, and I like being offered a beer by a brewer and confuse him by saying that Im not much of a beer person (because technically Im rarely more than 5% beer).","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

He handed me the growler (as well as another CBW growler) and whispered gently into my ear ""I want this to be inside you"".  So I stuck it in my trunk and drove home to NY with it, and am enjoying it currently.  Or previously depending on when you read this.  But you can imagine the time I sat around in my office while watching episodes of Burn Notice, organizing my bookshelves, and drinking this beer.  Pours a dark cola brown with a large beige head.  Big nutty malts hit right away, rich and malty.  Toast and nutty malt.  Medium bodied, smooth and malty, lots of nice roast and toast coming through.  Long toast with light bitterness.
