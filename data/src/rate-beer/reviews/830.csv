830,"2016-08-12",4.1,"Honningfarvet Imperial Pils/Strong Pale Lager med flot tætskummende hvid top, som svinder til . Markant ufiltreret og let perlende.
En ganske frugtrig aroma rammer næsen: Appelsin-, citrus- og grapefrugtnoter, men også en smule pilsnermalt. 
Smagsmæssigt rammes man nærmest af en ""juice-i-øl fornemmelse""; så frisk og lækker er dette bryg. Appelsin- og grapefrugt-noter, men elegant balance mellem sødme og bitterhed. Og paletten rundes dejligt bittert af. 
Middel fyldig krop og en fin olieret konsistens. Karboneringen er på et medium niveau, og alt i alt giver det en frisk mundfølelse. Afslutningen er ganske bitter og kort. 
Overall: Bedste nye øl fra Amager denne sommer, og jeg er allerede blevet forgiftet og afhængig. Valget af samarbejdspartner og valg af humletyper går op i en højere enhed. Friskhed fra frugt uden at være for sødlig og oveni pilsnerens charme.

830,"2016-07-03",3.2,"(50 cl bottle from the brewery; Batch #1375; BBD: July 2017) Poured at fridge temperature into a small Chios Brewery pilsener glass reveals a cloudy amber with two fingers of fluffy white head. The head fades somewhat but stays around leaving lace. Aroma is subdued sodapop, straw, grass and citrus fruit. Not terribly exciting. Oily texture, medium carbonation, medium to light body and a lingering, grassy finish. Flavour has a mild bitterness and a little counterbalancing sweetness. Decent beer but I find it difficult to appreciate the hopforward pilseners in general.","DENMARK","humlelala"
