The pour is a lighter golden orange yellow color with a thick head of off-white head that slowly falls down to a thick film with a couple good spots of lace. The aroma is nice. The citrus is great. Huge citra hops, light bitterness, great citrus zest, and a surprising crispness. The flavor is much of the same. Big, bright citra hops and a light leafy bitterness. The bitter citrus zest is wonderful and lets this thing do what it is supposed to. The mouth feel is a little syrupy, but brightly carbonated with a lingering citra blast.

1179,"2016-03-20",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Grapefruit pulp and sandy minerals (cat litter to some) are met by resinous bitterness in this engaging Double IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the hazy beige.
-The fruitiness is pleasant throughout.
-The mouthfeel is soft and effervesncent, quite drinkable for a Double IPA.
-Although this is a perfectly fine Double IPA, I think that their regular Just Outstanding IPA is more pleasant on many fronts.

1179,"2016-03-20",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of Jess, thanks a bunch! Pours a honey-orange color. A bit darker than expected. Nice 2 finger head of foam that fades to a ring. Aromas are pretty sweet...cereal grains, honey, rock candy....some peachy hop notes, light tangerine. Taste is pretty sticky sweet with a hefty malt bill. Much heavier on the palate than I expected. I wish the hops were allowed to shine a bit more here. Still, a pretty balanced beer that hides the alcohol fairly well. Finishes with more sticky sweetness that clings to the palate. Not much in the way of hop bitterness...maybe a small alcohol note for some bite, but definitely on the maltier side. Solid beer and glad to have tried it!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

Dry and bitter backend, good firm florals with touches of bread, gentle straw. Light, airy, bitter especially as it catches into the backend and finish.

Poured a honey, orange, hazy color with 2-to-3 fingers of khaki-white, rocky head. A few light bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good layered, foamy, spiderweb lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 4.13)

Taste wasnt as potent as the smell, which would be hard to live up to anyway.

1179,"2014-03-04",4.2,"Draft at the brewery this weekend, multiple pours! Aroma is sticky grapefruit, passionfruit, mango, light pineapple, dank herbs, twiggy, resin, citrus. Last years bottle aroma was a lot less pungent, and had more stone fruit like peach, but the draft version is still pretty fruity. The beer pours a cloudy deep golden color with orange highlights and moderate white head. The retention is medium and the lacing eventually gets washed away with each sip. Taste is extremely tropical with lots of pineapple, guava, mango and orange peel. Towards the back of the tongue more citrus arrives with moderate earthy bitterness, citrus peels, resiny. Body is medium-light with medium-high carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Moderate alcohol warmth, low alcohol bite and low astringency. After taste is slightly vegetal with some leaves and twigs; however each sip brings back so much citrus its more of an afterthought. The bottle version last year didnt have that on the palate and was juicier, creamier with a lot more tropical fruit on the after taste. Overall the 2014 version was still pretty darn delicious with light creamy body, medium dank hop note and lots of tropical fruit and citrus. I drank 2 pints easily and contemplated a third.

One of the best aromas you can get from an IPA. Mango, pineapple, guava, grapefruit, apricot, peach, tangerine, some sticky passion fruit... Fruit orgy, backed up by a lightly dank & resinous hop profile with plenty of sticky, dripping hop oils. Light pine & resin with nice pungency & just a touch of green onion in the finish. Taste is amazing as well. Another tropical & citric fruit explosion; citrus, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, honeydew, passion fruit... you name it.

Leaves spectacular cotton candy lace. There are plenty of bubbles rising to the surface. The nose is simply terrific. Tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, Grapefruit, orange and lemon citrus, candied fruit peel. A sweet floral and a succulent hop sweetness. The malt promises some sweetness but doesnt smell heavy or sugary. Taste is splendid. Grapefruit comes to the front of the palate bringing a hop punch of juicy fruit flavors with it. The body of the beer is soft and while amply carbonated its supple and smooth. The malt teases you with a bit of flaky biscuit that is not too sweet. 

This beer is simply the lightest DIPA I have ever had. The malt is vibrant in and of itself and the flaky biscuit quality has its sweetness in the bread and not from sugar. The hops are graceful and abundant but not oily or resiny or even too piney. The fruits were simply stated in their own right. As many as there were I could name them all thats how well done they are. Grapefruit is an engaging taste and this one lets all the other exotic fruits stand behind its grapefruit. Not too much pith but just enough to accent a dazzling little bitter that steals the show from any sugary sweetness you think you are about to taste. You can believe the hype about this one. Its straight forward and well turned out. A pleasure to drink ! Thank you Richard!","New York, USA","pinkie"

Aroma is certainly citra - passionfruit, pine resin, cat piss, grapefruit. Flavor is the same, juicy. Lightly sweet and surprisingly light bitterness - these hops are going into flavor, not bittering. Medium body, oily mouthfeel. No detectable presence of that 8% ABV - it really sneaks up on you. This is the kind of IPA I am growing to love most - not overly bitter, but full of fruity, juicy hop goodness. Right up there with Exponential and Heady as one of the best.

Bottle came from a trade with HoppySuds (in person in CA) and I shared this 22oz brew with my cousin Mark in a tasting held at my new house in Benton Park.  This was one of the few (besides D4) that we finished the whole bottle during the tasting.  There was no markings on the bottle of any bottling date. 

The appearance was made up of a big, long lasting 1 and 1/2 finger head that was very frothy with bubbles. Had a deep orange/copper colored body with slight hazing.  Left great lacing behind. 

In the aroma, tons of fruit, hops, and mango are all thrown hard.  Very great and appropriate for this Double hopped up IPA.

Flavor? Big Hopped (American variety), Fruity, and has a Medium-High bitterness level.  Not too much complexity.

The mouthfeel starts with a medium to high body is well pronounced with hop.  Medium carbonation and finishes with TONS of citra, hence the name.

Cheers to this one! Not sure Id throw it onto one of the top 10 beers of popular category but it was damn good.  Would like to see another bottle of this in my future.  Go for it!","Ballwin, Missouri, USA","DConMan"

T: The taste follows the nose perfectly. Citrus pineapple and orange with a touch of lemon peel. Sweet caramel malts and light bitter hops on the finish.

1179,"2012-06-19",4.6,"Managed to grab a growler of this through a recent trade. Thanks. Beer is yellow and light in color but completely hazy. Carbonation is moderate which is good since its a growler. There is a lot of lacing on the glass from the white head of small to medium bubbles. Looks nice.

From the first moment I started pouring this beer, the aroma knocked me down. Seriously, it is one of the best smelling beers I have ever smelled. Complex fruit salad of peaches and pineapple and mango. Its the citra hops that give it such a floral and complex aroma, Im now thinking about making a line of air fresheners that use citra hops. Amazing.

Like most west coast IPAs this is not a malt bomb. It is relatively light on the tongue, lots of carbonation stimulates the midpalate and focuses your attention on the fruitish flavors of this beer. It doesnt start out too bitter but it gets you there pretty quickly. Bitterness definitely grows over the course of the beer, no aftertaste though, just lingers. Drinkability is high, not as high as a few other DIPAs but its up there. Its a great example and experiment in the potential hops have on the overall character of a beer. I would recommend this in a heartbeat and would definitely have it again.","Maryland, USA","drabmuh"

How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh a few weeks after purchase and quickly sent to me by Alen, thanks a lot Alen
The look: Cloudy dark blonde ale topped by a medium white head with good retention
In long: Nose has plenty of mangos, some other tropical fruits, some cat urine (I get that from most IPAs that make heavy use of Citra) and some light notes of pine-tree.  Taste is bready pale malts, residual sugars, a bit of bubblegum, dried fruits, tropical fruits.  Bitterness level is only medium.  Very tasty.  Unfortunately the after-taste has a little too much residual sugars.  As of this writing the two heavyweights of the blonde Citra Double IPA sub-genre is this one and the Hill Farmstead Double Citra.  They both have a very similar flavor profile but I find that the Hill Farmstead is more aromatic, has a more pronounced fruitiness and feels a little less sweet.  Still, this Ken River is a very good beer, almost excellent.  Yet another top-rated Californian IPA, so I guess what you guys are saying is that they make great hoppy beers in California no kidding tell me something I dont already know.

Citra pours a pleasant orange tangerine color, a bit hazy with a fluffy white head that levels off at 3cm that retains nicely and leaves a ton of lacing all over the glass. 

A ton of citra hops in the nose, very nice. Peach, apricot, mango, passion fruit, grapefruit, and orange blossoms as well. 

The pale malt up front provides a bit of sweetness and really just lets the hops shine through. As the aroma would suggest, there is a ton of juicy citrus here. Passion fruit, mango, grapefruit, with some floral notes as well. Finishes lightly bitter.

That wonderful well-crafted creamy IPA feel. Fuller than medium carbonation, juicy, a bit sticky at the end, all wrapped in a medium body.

Wow is all I had to say to myself when I popped this growler open.  I was afraid that maybe the beer lost some of its greatness in the trip across the country but hell no.   This is one of the best smelling beers Ive ever had.  You get blasted and I mean blasted by fruit.  Citrus and other tropical fruits.  Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, etc.  Just amazing.  Luckily there is a small malt backbone here to keep things in check.  Doesnt matter though.  The smell is out of this world and its full of hops.  I want to take a damn bath in this beer.

With some beers your all psyched when you have a fantastic smell and then you try that first taste and youre disappointed.  Not here.  This beer blew me away.  Up front you get blasted once again by hops.  Fruity.  Just plain citrus and other fruits.  Amazing.  But the beer also has a rawness to it.  A freshness that is hard to explain.  The hops are just so pronounced.  You can tell this beer was dry hopped a ton.  Theres a also a nice bitterness to this brew but its not overwhelming.

A: Hazy dark citrus orange in color with a nice white bubbly head that fades to a nice layer of foam on the surface. The color makes me want to bathe in it. So beautiful 

S: This stuff should be sold to beer geeks as a sexual pheromone. The aroma on this is just outrageous! First pop of the cap and the waft of tropical/exotic fruits and hops hits your nose immediately. This is a full on aromatic assault of citrus, mangoes, peaches, grapefruit, pineapple and some resinous hoppy citrus hops. Holy shit this stuff smells like sex in a bottle. 

T&M : Not surprisingly, the flavor follows the nose almost to a tee. A full on mouthgasm of hoppy citrus flavors, mangoes, peaches, pineapple, orange, and enough malt backbone to perfectly compliment everything. The malt backbone almost has a honey like quality but in no way is sweet like honey. Beautiful. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yet crisp and amazingly refreshing. This is highly, HIGHLY drinkable. This beer is liquid art.

Medium orange with some golden highlights and a two finger, well-retained off-white head.  Passionfruit is up front in the nose with some sweet cotton candy, tinge of alcohol.  Digging slightly deeper I get some green dry hopped notes, and some ripe sweet orange.  Flavor continues with the tropical fruit and sweet cotton candy hop combo that I enjoy so much, though the hops seem slightly restrained.  Pretty moderate sweetness doesnt seem to be tempered incredibly well by the hops, though there is some effort.  The finish is semi-dry with bitterness peaking at a 4-5.

1179,"2011-12-13",4.1,"Bottle - 22oz.  Cracked the bottle and was immediately greeted with an explosion of pine (Columbus and Citra?) and mango (Amarillo?). Citra pours a mildly hazy, beautiful sunset-orange. Boasts a perfect, not-too-foamy long-lasting head which acts as a cushion, softening the landing into that crisp co2 mouth-feel and immediate hop bite. HUGE aroma; Grass, pine, grapefruit, mango, bubblegum, honey, feet, and a hint of fat people BO. Smells a bit like the Christmas tree in my living room. What stands out of me is how medium-bodied this is, much more full and chewy than most imperial IPAs released lately,  which are typically much thinner. Flavor is very similar to its aroma, minus the fruit; and not to my surpise ... not very bitter. Tastes ""green,"" bringing to the table grass, pine, and a hint of oxidation (which comes with every IPA not consumed within 5 minutes of bottling). There is recognizable caramel malt character and sweetness grounding that hop flavor explosion, all while still allowing it to go out and play, much like a parent telling their teenage daughter she needs to be in by midnight. Finishes clean with zero off-flavors. This thing is dry-hopped so much that you can actually feel the hop oil coating your mouth after each sip.  Overall, this is great stuff. Worthy of a GABF gold? ... perhaps. Lives up to its hype, even though the bottle I have is weeks old since bottling. I could only imagine what it tastes like fresh from the source.

T - Starts off with lot of citrus hops with again, lots of pineapple, orange, and mango flavors. There is also some nice bitterness in the background. Through the middle, the hops just keep on building with the bitterness and there is just enough sweet caramel malts to balance.

Update from after trying the beer on tap at the Citra release. This beer is very well made and it was a pleasure meeting the whole team out on Kernville.

A: Dark copper-orange-amber body. Large, off-white head formed from a sizable stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. Good retention holds the head up for a few minutes before crashing to a nice skim and a well-defined ring. Nice coating of lacing, not sheets, but significant coverage.

S: Tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange dominate up front. A nice resinous quality. Freshly baked biscuits and bread. Some zesty spice. I also was getting a hint of caramelized brown sugar. Very interesting. Tons of hops, but a sizable malt base.

T: Like the nose there are massive doses of hops and malt here in the flavor profile. The hops are pronounced with mango and grapefruit separating themselves from the rest of the citric notes. Lots of sweet, freshly baked baked goods. 

M: Creamy, medium body with good rolling carbonation. Resinous and oily. Solid bitterness throughout culminating with a nice aggressive bite. 

O: All around interesting and enjoyable dIPA. Combines the freshness of west coast style dIPAs with the sweet bakery like malt of big, east coast IPAs.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

5.0 S: Big hop explosion like a fresh Hopslam, but without the malty backbone. Absolutely tons and tons of orange, apricot, candied mango, grapefruit and a host of other tropical fruits. Slightly yeasty, and you can tell the malts are there, but they get lost in the wonderful hops.

4.5 T: Again, the hops deliver. Grapefruit and pine take over in the taste. Moderate, but soft bitterness. Lots of orange, peach, and tropical fruit. Yeasty again, but barely noticeable compared to the other flavors. Malts give a touch of sweetness to balance and not much else.

5.0 M: Heavier medium body, not the shitty watery like many west coast IPAs. This is just how I like my DIPAs. Wonderfully creamy and a bit chewy.

While this might not be nearly as bitter as other West Coast beers of the same style, the flavor is just unbeatable; I dont care what the style is.

Serving type: growler

On tap at Downtown Johnny Browns. Pours a cloudy orange color with big white head. The lacing is insane.
AROMA: 
Huge mango and passion fruit smells more like juice than beer
FLAVOR: 
Orange and sugar cookies to start, then candied orange peel, the tropical flavors to finish.
MOUTHFEEL:
Medium body but finishes a bit thin. That is my biggest complaint.
DRINKABILITY: 
Extremely drinkable but this tastes more like a soda than beer. I find it hard to believe that there is any alcohol in there.",", California, USA","seanbhudson"

Craemy mouthfeel leads to more fruity hop delight.  Robust grapefruit hop notes with intense resin bitterness.  Playful fruitiness compliments this nicely.

The aromas are full of rich hops full of grapefruit ring, mango, orange cream. The flavors follow with a crazy creamy orange, floral, mango, and grapefruit concoction.

1179,"2010-08-22",4.5,"Absolutely fantastic beer.   I had a few glasses of this beer and was just blown away.  I really didnt expect it to live up to the hype, but I was happily wrong on that score.  It has easily the best Citra flavor in the 10 or so Citra IPAs Ive tried so far.  It was all very bright floral and tangerine notes.  The beer is quite well made.  Just enough light malt sweetness to carry the hops.  Finishes mildly dry and refreshing.  Little to no harshly bitter notes.  This is a very easy beer to like and makes me want to make the long drive down to Kernville.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

A-pours a dirty murky brown liquid with dark orange edges with a fair amount of dirty white head that leaves a ton of lacing.

S-the nose has this buttery dough with caramel malt base up front, same as the just outstanding IPA, tons of hops take ever, lots of bitter pine, citrus hops galore, big in the nose.

T-the taste has a very light doughy flavor, notes of caramel, syrupy pine, tons of citrus in the back, grapefruit mostly, moderate bitterness that is quite pleasant and doesnt linger or sting the back of the tongue.

M-medium bodied, a little syrupy, creamy up front with lots of carbonation giving it a somewhat grainy feel in the back.

D-this has a big balance of malt and hop, the citrus comes in nicely and the bitterness is moderate.  not as huge as I thought this was going to be nor as hoppy.  the balance was very nice and I actually really enjoy this buttery dough flavor their IPAs have had.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy peach with a creamy cap of foam.

Aroma has piney, grapefruit, mango, citrus hop aromas present with a nice, balanced sweetness.  Pretty damn fruity nose.  Mostly hazy golden orange body with a large, frothy white head that leaves really nice white lacing.  Citrus passionfruit flavors dominate the start with a little pineapple, too.  This is just exploding with hops.  This also has a really nice sweet malty backbone, which stands up to the hops nicely, leaving a really balanced and drinkable beer.

1179,"2010-07-08",4.2,"Growler opened on the 4th of July thanks to my homie, Gorefiendus! Muchos gracis! Split with friends into tasting glasses. 

A - Pours a hazy golden/copper color, white head, lots of bubbles here and there, good lacing/retention, nice cap on top. A really nice looking DIPA we have here.

S - Hops, dankness, floral notes, light citrus zest. Lots of stuff going on here, but overall, a lot of hops and citrus. Not as overwhelming and in-your-face as I was expecting, which I like. Its subtle yet you know its all there...so good.

T - Similar to the nose. Dank hops, floral notes, lemon/lime zest, grapefruit. Not too powerful, just right. This is a monster, but very well done. Really enjoying the hops and citrus...nice! Citrus/bitter finish.

M - Medium bodied, sticky on the palate, decently dry finish and very crisp and clean.

D - So so good, worthy of its rank on here. I didnt think this one was going to be so good, but I was wrong. I drank several glasses out of the growler...probably a large majority of it. I want more!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

T: A lot of hop fruitiness and a solid bread base. Up front, there is a nice grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. A bit of bready malt in the middle and a great bitterness on the finish.

M: The body is medium with a mild to moderate level of carbonation.

1179,"2010-06-19",4.1,"Huge thanks to Joe for sharing this growler!

Pours a bright hazy golden yellow with a small soapy white head that shows good retention and a bit of lacing.

The aroma is full of juicy sweet citrus fruits - oranges and pineapples.  Maybe a bit of floral pine but its mostly the citrus hops.  There is a light crisp pale malt presence as well.

The taste is more of the same with the massive juicy citrus hops dominating from the start.  Theres a solid bready malt backbone which gives way to a bitterness in the end, partly from citrus but also from a bit of resinous pine hops.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation.  Extremely crisp with a slightly dry finish.

This is a great DIPA and has a ton of flavor but is insanely drinkable.  Glad to have the opportunity to try this one.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

1179,"2010-05-22",4.2,"Big props to Jose for hooking me up here.

Pours a hazy dark honey gold with hints of orange. About two fingers of head rises, good sign with a growler, but it fades pretty quickly, Light lacing.

The aroma is kind of light but its nice. Good balance of light sweet citrus on the front with a pronounced but mellow hoppiness. The hops are present throughout, light pine.

The taste is super malty for an ipa, grapefruit, pineapple, light hop finish, a little pine on the very end.

The feel is ok, easy drinker.

Overall, this is interesting, tasty and easy to drink. However, not much of an ipa let alone a double ipa. Doesnt have a ton of hops, so thats a little of a let down. If it was just a bit more hoppy to balance out the malt it would be awesome.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

gloat orange brown with a frothy white head... Vibrant hoppy aroma of  
some dank green hop and an abundance of sweet tropical and citrusy  
hops. A little sugary malt to merge with the aforementioned hops...  
Flavors are malty and tropical sweet forward with an earthiness to  
it.  Sweet overall wish it had somewhat more of a bitter bite to it
