1803,"2017-02-01",4.3,"Its good beer in the porter genre. A bit mämmi-ish and home beer -like though, so it doesnt taste like a ""world-class"" beer should. But some may find this a plus, rather than a minus.

Aroma is strong, dark and rich.
The taste is also very burnt and rich. Chocolate, coffee, raisins, all sorts of ""black"" things.

Good is that theres not too much bitterness. The beer might even be a bit too sweet, but this might be a matter of taste.

The carbonation feels a bit sloppy, but fits to the style.

1803,"2015-03-10",4.2,"Hopeless jet black color, cardboard brown finger of head. 

Aroma is roasted, toaste chocolate and mocha. Burnt cookie bottoms. There is a plum and slightly puckery raisin. The scent is absolutely superior. It is very European -- deep malts, no hope presence -- but it holds up to an American RIS in the nose.

The flavor is sweeter than expected: more toffee, caramel, and a touch of cocoa. The plum is much more prominent in the flavor. It is a ""soft"" flavor, might have mellowed out from the long trip overseas. Does have a toasted aftertaste, almost like a marshmallow.

The feel is very soft and pillowy. Its a terrific, biggish beer: slaps your face but then catches you and gently lowers you to the ground.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

Roasty with a beautiful dark fruit and wonderful chocolate. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and lacking. The carbonation doesn't help at all, and the finish is just a little light.

A - Pours jet black with a small half finger tall khaki colored head leaving faint wisps of lacing down the length of the glass.


S - Smells of darkness thru and thru. Huge amount of dark roast; mostly dark chocolate malt, espresso, and burnt wood; mixes well with a light molasses sweetness. Nothing too over the top, just a solid nose.


T - Plenty of dark roasted chocolate malt up front quickly giving way to a mix of espresso coffee beans, charred wood, and some light molasses sweetness. The alcohol creeps in toward the end but it blends in pretty well. The finish is mostly dark roast with a bit of lingering sweetness. The smoke grows stronger as is warms, threatening to overrun everything else but it stops just short. Tone the smoke back a bit and this one would be VERY good.


M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Big smokey feel to this one that carries over into the finish, mixing with some lingering sweetness.

It pours a viscous black body with a rather large, creamy, dense, medium brown head that is very long-lived and that laces the glass excellently. The sweet aroma is very strong and has lovely roasted notes and a smooth and delicious mix of dark caramel and chocolate. In the very strong flavour I also get some pleasant notes of dry coffee, but the caramel and chocolate are more obvious. It might be a simple flavour profile without any fancy hoppy notes, but it works for me. The taste is moderate sweet, and the long-lasting finish is moderate bitter. The mouthfeel is unusually pleasant, its creamy with a soft carbonation and a full body. Wow! Just wow!

Perfect also on the aroma of black currants/Crème de cassis, blackberries, dark chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. The flavour is just so farking perfect too, with dark, bitter chocolates, caramel, dulce de leche, honey, liquorice, tart berries and a touch of yogurt sourness.

Le goût développe des saveurs davantage rôtis avec un caramel amplifié et un chocolat légèrement diminué.  Peut-être même quelques fruits qui saccrochent aux papilles.  En bouche, le liquide a un corps moyennement charpenté avec une effervescence qui me semble modérée et une texture douce, voire crémeuse.

Pours a pitch black with a nice foamy caramel/tan colored head. The head glistens almost like shiny sand. It gives way to healthy lumps of lacing.

This one is bold on scent. It leans heavily on heavy dark choloclate, with some sweet roasted malt on the side. A tiny bit of dark dried fruit is in there too.

Its full bodied but it has almost a slippery mouthfeel as it seems like the stuff just slides merrily across your tongue and then down your throat. Tastes like chocolate espresso. Has a nice lactic/milk sour twang as well. Its malt, malt, and more malt, very tasty.

A lot of chocolate malts on the nose, with notes of dark fruit, tobacco, dust, cardboard, and burnt sugar.  The flavor is more smoothed out than the aroma indicates, with notes of chocolate malts, roast, brown sugar, light hops, and dark fruits late.

Basically black, it has a very large, rich, frothy light brown head that shrinks only slowly to a permanent, thin, foamy top and rich, frothy lace.

The taste is rich, complex, smooth and clean.  All flavours, sweetness and bitterness are beautifully balanced with complex taste of leaves, chocolate, dark toasted brown bread, prunes, a hint of port, some raisin, black pepper, the latter stronger in the finish, with an increasing taste of black coffee condensed with brown sugar that is stronger by the end. It is rather dry throughout, not too bitter or sweet. In the middle, it has a definite but light sweetness and light but slightly stronger bitterness right at the finish, but for most of the time, up front and in the final finish and aftertaste, it is mostly dry, clean, and leafy.","California, USA","Wulfstan"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was completely opaque black in the glass with a large, rocky and foamy, dark tan head that kept a fair sheet and left excellent lacing. The aroma was mostly hot cocoa mix, light roasted and burnt malts, light to moderate hops, light yeast and sour fruits. The flavor started out slightly sweet and sour, and finished sour and bitter with an average to long duration. There was light burnt and roasted malt, cocoa powder, sour fruit and bitter earthy, metallic hops. The medium body was oily then dry with tingly carbonation and a slightly metallic, slightly chalky and lightly astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Palate is smooth, though thin when swishing the beer around in mouth.  I tasted sweet malt and dark chocolate notes to start, then transitioning to a bitter, ashy profile by the finish.  There was also something unusual going on here.  Through the mid-palate, I kept tasting something resembling coca-cola, with perhaps a touch of straw and chalkiness.

Gorgeous deep/dark pour and a fluffy, long-lasting rich tan head.  Takes a good 5 minutes for the head to dissipate.  Aroma is slightly sweet, with the heavy aroma of roasted malt.

As it waterfalls out of the bottle you can tell this beer is very dark brown but in the glass it is pitch black. The head struggles to form upwards through this beers viscosity, but manages a nice inch of foam. It leaves a thin smattering of lacing before settling to an amorphous cap atop the liquid.

The nose is bitter chocolate, with a sizable dose of roastiness. Some espresso comes through as well.

Taste is far more roasty than the aroma, with some unsweetened chocolate and a charcoal/metallic finish. Pretty classic porter here. I dont get a lot of dark fruit anywhere in this beer.

Carbonation is pretty smooth but the finish is sticky. The metallic note also hampers the drinkability.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

The look: Black body with a medium tan head with medium retention
In long: Strong molasses nose.  The soft but full body is richly malted with upfront molasses and figs flavours and lots of small bubbles.  Slowly chocolate joins the party as the beer warms-up.  An unexpected but pleasant sensation of wood/barrel although Im pretty sure it isnt barrel aged.  Surprisingly smooth yet very.  The woody hops dry out the beer more than provide bitterness and thats just fine.  As the beer kept warming up more and more woody and tobacco flavours were coming through and it kept getting better.  Currently it is both the highest rated and most rated Finland beer and deservingly so.

The taste is crazy, in a very good way. Starts roasty, then transitions into bakers chocolate, then the dark fruit kicks in then washed away by a hop bite that dissapears to a coffee but silky flavor.

Soy sauce continues in the flavor as well as some sweet smoked malt, and hints of toffee. Flavor is limited but distinct. Mouthfeel starts off nearly watery but becomes full and chewy towards the end. Soy sauce dominates. Fresh is better but this was quite enjoyable with some sharp cheddar.

Tasting is another story.  This beer is a bit too sour, not creamy bitter, just oddly sour.  The other negative is it is too thin.  Good porter in my mind should be on the thicker, slighty oily side.  This is a little too weak.  The finish is clean with a bit of a bite.

Nice medium body that isnt too thin or thick, with a slight worcestershire tastes.  Dull fig flavor as well and tastes too much like a peaty, Mcewans scotch ale or Traquair house to me.

Mouthsmackingly good. Its going really well with lox, but the lox smoke may affect the ale flavor. Maybe there is some cola in this. It is very tasty.

1803,"2007-11-09",3.8,"Pours a very dark red hued brown with an ample creamy tan head, diminishing slowly, rocky at first.  Fruity dark fruit nose.  Lightly sweet, small acidic roast.  Big prunes and raisins particularly.  Small chocolate and subtle coffee.  A bit of an herbal maybe slightly anise and chicory backdrop.  The mouthfeel isnt super thick and viscous, but not watery, with low carbonation.  A bit of warming. Much bigger roast and roasty acidity than I would have guessed a prior from the nose.  A really biting roast that balances the slightly above average sweetness, which is dominated by dark fruits, raisins and currants with some prunes.  The biting charcoal finish is laced with a touch of anise.  Theres a good deal of complexity in this baltic porter, than that I think Ive previously encountered.  Perhaps the only drawback is that Ill have to drink another beer to not get heartburn from this!  Still, a very lovely beer.

It has lots of rich, complex dark malts, semi-sweet chocolate, sweet licorice, some distance char, and maybe even a hint of Dr. Pepper.  The flavor is also quite complex.  It has a deep, darkly roasted maltiness, molasses, carmelized sugar, some wood (probably from the oxidation), char, and smooth chocolate undertones.

Heavy roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, raisins, plums and vanilla all delight the olfactory system.

Smell: Mmm! Wouldnt you like to know. Loads of sweet, luscious treats in the nose - dark chocolate, raisins, reduced-sodium soy sauce, molasses, coffee beans, and chimney soot.

Taste: While the aroma alluded to a sweeter taste, the flavor is mostly dry, with semi-sweet chocolate maltiness that comes across as being practically fudgelike. Some hints of coffee and licorice, too. A balanced, somewhat acidic bitterness makes for a quick finish.

Sinebrychoff Porter pours the deepest of browns. Mahogany highlights shine through only when held to the light. A 1 finger creamy tan head formed on the pour and left patchy lacing as it slowly receded. Leaves more lacing after each sip. Very nice looking beer.

The aroma is big and heavy. Molasses and dark fruits take center stage. The fruit in the form of figs and black cherries. Slightly doughy with a nice helping of bittersweet chocolate. Slight hint of frothed milk as it warms.

Flavor is identical to the aroma but the flavors are more subtle and blend seamlessly. Theres a very mild, soft metallic twang on the finish along with just a hint of coffee grounds. Good porter.

The mouthfeel is top notch on this beer. Its creamy and super smooth up front and gets frothy on the swallow. Zero hint of alcohol. 

The drinkability for such a big porter is very good. Subtle well balanced flavors and the absence of alcohol in flavor and heat make this beer an easy one to put away.

A good Baltic porter Ive been wanting to try for awhile now. Glad I finally did. Ill be picking up more of these in the future.

1803,"2007-05-22",4.1,"33 cl bottle. Sugary impy stout smell upon opening. Pours a thick brown under an inch-high brown foam. First impression I get in tasting is its hops, a rare thing for a porter. But there they are,  noble as Edward Tudor yet crude as Tom Canty. Backed up with plenty of molasses and fusels. It also reminds me of my very first Guinness all those years ago.

Dark brown to black (again, of course). Rich medium sized frothy mocha head, leaving copious lacing as it settles. Oh the sweetest chocolate mousse and coconut milk aroma on this one, comparable to Pannepot of all things. The nose has seriously kicked it up a notch in the last few months. Any bitterness previously there has mellowed significantly and now only factors into the finish. I dont like my porters too light or too heavy; this one is just perfect, delivering all the goods. There is definitely something astoundingly Pannepotish in this one, just that instant of mellow chocolate mousse sweetness that hits you before melding into a light roasty bitterness. Perfect palate again. Overall, this is very, very good from an objective standpoint, but subjectively its still a little short of hitting that peak of deliciousness or complexity that takes a beer to the top. Besides that tiny criticism, this is highly recommended, buy several bottles and try them at different ages.

The Baltic Porter style is basically the Imperial Stout of old, and this is a perfect example. Heavy oily roasted aroma, but not enough to prepare you for the huge smack in the gob when you first taste it. Sweet, spicey, coffee, malty by the bucketload, with crisp bitter notes, and a sharpness from the carbonation that almost makes this 7.2%-er ""refreshing"". All of the above is well balanced I must add, which might be due to it being top-fermented.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Medium to thin body made up for by strong doppelbocky, Scotch-aley malt presence, with a combination of sweet and smoky finish.  Strong finish has flavor particles crisply dancing on the tongue.  (Medium-thin body actually works well on this - moving the palate score from 4 to 5.)  Ill gladly have another.  Worth seeking out.

Full inviting aroma of molasses, dark fruit like dates and plums. The aroma is complex. I also get roasted malts, chocolate malts, and a bit of alcohol. From the fist two sips I get a metallic note that de-rails a nice tasting beer just as it was getting started. This off note does seem to subside as more beer is consumed. If this was a 22oz the second half of the beer would be flawless. So behind the initial metallic shavings I taste flavors that mirror the aroma with molasses, dates, plums, roasted malts and chocolate malts.

1803,"2006-12-27",3.4,"1999 vintage I wish I could say I had the years of knowledge, the due diligence, the foresight, the experience, and capacity to have personally saved a bottle of this beer for 7 years.  But it would be a lie, maybe in 7 years from now I will be able to say that.  This bottle was bought at a special vintage event and it should have been kept relatively well.  It was fridged for 48 hours and held at room temperature for about 20 minutes.  Popped with a small hiss and pours with just the smallest brown lacing.  Aroma is on the mild side of being present and mainly a charred malt.  Taste is a bit better with some chocolate and a nice dry roastiness in the aftertaste.  Body is lighter than I like (I usually find this to be the problem with the Baltic, Baltic Porters).  A bit of bitterness at the end as well. This has lost a lot of the characteristics I enjoy in a fresh Koff, which I really enjoy.

Initial aroma is of roasted coffee beans, but any burnt aspects dissipate. Theres some sweetness in the nose, maybe toffee, and a mild floweriness from hops.

The beer is smooth, thick, and slightly oily on the palate. No roasted flavors like you might expect from an American version, but thats no fault. Chocolate takes its turn on the tongue and the beer features a very pleasant drying bitterness. The high alcohol is almost completely masked. This is a very fine beer.

Aroma is suggesting a sweetness in the taste, it has a well hidden sour accent and lots of coffee hints with a touch of roasted malts. Taste is dryer than expected and the beer leaves a slight midicinal touch in the taste. It is faintly herbal, malty and spicey. In the afthertaste you can notice accents of dry honey, grass and hops.

Coffee nose, but caramelly at the same time, quite sweet. Taste is fully roasted, scorched coffeebeans or breadcrust, sweetness just a faraway cry. After some time, a typical sourness from roasted barley appears, however restrained. Bit aggressive burning, and not at all full-bodied, thin for a 7.2 ABV beer.

It works with the other aromas very well. Very nice toasted malt flavor with a lightly hoppy and alcoholic finish. Im convinced that when Porters stay out of the realm of Stouts they are some of the best beers in the world.

Flavor is enjoyable but disappointing after the aroma.  A large amount of residual sweetness, though is somehow thin and slightly watery.","san diego, California, USA","winegarner"

Light coffee, some chocolate, licorice, dried fruits, and some roasted accents. Nice hop touch to the finish, again, a dryness that kept this from feeling ""thick,"" deceptively thin.

1803,"2006-05-12",3.7,"From the bottle.

Pours a relatively dark black with a big fluffy tan head. The aroma is roasted malt, a bit of agar, and some sweaty socks. The flavor is dark-roasted grain, bits of sweetness, hints of fruit, with a decent bitter finish that is too heavy on the burnt coffee. The mouthfeel is enjoyable, but slightly thin for the ABV.

This is a nice strong porter, but drinking it head-to-head against the exceptional Dark Horse Reserve Black Bier, it just doesnt measure up in aroma, flavor, or mouthfeel. It has nothing like the flavor complexity of the Dark Horse, and the palate comes off on the thin side.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

On the nose, theres plenty of chocolate and a hint of unpleasant cardboard. On the palate, lots of chocolate and sugar, and then a strong bitter finish. This sudden contrast of sweetness and hops was unnerving. I found this beer analagous to an attractive cousin of the opposite sex; the juxtaposition is always unsettling.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

1803,"2006-01-28",5.0,"This is a rich, delicious, smooth, and silky Baltic Porter, coming in at a warming 7.2% abv and makes the perfect beer to match with a rich desert, or to enjoy as a night cap. 

Koff Porter pours to a beautiful, deep ebony color with a thick and creamy tan head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic with big aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, licorice, and peppery alcohol. The palate is rich and full with big dark malt, chocolate, slight roast, licorice, and coffee flavors on a silky smooth, polished body. Koff Porter finishes with more of those big chocolate and coffee notes, then ends with a dry roast and peppery alcohol finish that lingers. 

This is a world class example of Baltic Porter, one of the best in the style, and one loved by beer geeks world wide, including former presidents. This beer is best suited for cold winter months as a winter warmer, but is also the perfect beer to match with a rich, chocolate desert, and would make an idea after dinner drink or night cap. It retails in good beer markets for about $2.50-$3 a 11.2 oz or 33 cl bottle, and is well worth the price. If you can find this beer in your market, seek it out, and enjoy a world class beer from Finland.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Leaves you with some light lacing.  The aroma presents with rich malts, chocolate and carameleven hints of marshmallow.  I caught distinctive notes of the latter early on but they faded as it warmed.  The first thing I thought when I took the first sip was, Damn, should have read the description prior to drinking this one.  This was much fuller and richer than I expected, and truly seemed along the lines of an imperial stout (though not that strong or flavorful).  Chocolate and caramel malts are big and there is a light fruity presence (cherries?) that pop up in the middle.  There is a bit of sharpness that creeps out in the middle and is distracting but that fades quickly into a pleasing dark chocolate after taste.  Med-full body with a slick oily mouth feel.  Very nice.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Plenty of good sniffin here: raisins, plums, tart cherries on the one hand, and roasty coffee, burnt toast and a hint of lactose on the other.  Fantastic aromas all around.

1803,"2005-08-12",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2005 I decided to pick to the youngest (2003) and the oldest (1997) vintages of this beer at Greens today to do a side by side comparison.  Since they both were at $3.95 a piece for a 330 ml. bottle, it was basically ageing without the effort.

Poured into identically sized pint glasses, they both came out pitch black, which was no surprise.  The 2003 was much more carbonated and formed a two finger head rather easily.  The 1997 seemed to have a much smaller head and it did not last anywhere near as long as the younger beer.  The older beer smelled very sweet with notes of sherry, dark fruits, and lactic acid.  The younger one was more porter like, with emphasis on coffee and chocolate, and with a much weaker smell too.

Taste of the older beer was oak like, with a complex character full of sweet gum, vanilla, soy, and tannins.  The younger beer was more straightforward in the flavor profile, with a chocolate flavored dark roasted coffee taste coming to mind.  The older beer exhibited a mellow rich character, while the younger beer felt harsher, if only in comparison.

The older beer was silky smooth, and glided effortlessly across the tongue.  The younger beer was fuller in the mouth, with the slight hop bitterness, roast malt bite, and some sourness playing a part in the aftertaste.  The younger beer also felt hotter, although at 7.2%, neither was really all that boozy.  The younger beer had more of a mouth coating quality to it, while the older was slippery.

An amazing evolution took place in six years to make a straightforward porter into some otherworldly wine like mixture.  If I had second thoughts about ageing darker beers for extended periods, this vertical has put them to bed.

The scores reflect a mix of both.  The appearance of the younger beer was better, while smell of the older beer was far richer.  The edge in taste goes to the older beer as well.  In the mouthfeel department, there was more going on in the younger beer, but the older was more pleasant.  Overall, Id take the older beer as the more drinkable and interesting of the two.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Poured a sinister black, with a small medium-brown head.  Aroma of dark roasted malt, strong coffee, a bit of sour milk, alcohol, essence of various nutmeats and a little wheat-beer ashiness.  Flavour of prune juice, dark roasted malts - mustiness & old barrel fire ashes.  Oily  and creamy mouthfeel, but disappointingly weak-bodied, a little metallic harshness in the finish.

1803,"2005-07-29",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2005 1998 VintageRated December 2005. Black body, small creamy dark khaki head. Initial impression of the aroma is dry kitty litter, which thankfully does not return. Chocolate malted milk quality to it, with muted raisins and dark fruit. Flavour is moderatley vinuous but it dominates the whole flavour profile. Fruity flavour with a not quite sour acidity is mostly indecipherable from the vinuous nature of the beer as a whole. Second wave of prunes, figs, and date squares. Medium almost oily palate. Lots of nice underlying flavours are spoiled by off putting nature of the beer as a whole. 8/4/6/3/14<P>

1998 VintageRated July 2005.  Dark black body, small milk chocolate coloured head. Aroma is malt, and muted chocolate. Similar flavour with mild roast coming into its element in the finish.

1803,"2005-06-12",4.2,"First impression of Koff was through a firm and friendly handshake... a sweet & smoky, roasted aroma. Then you step back to take a good look at your new ""friend""... he has a staunch, ""take no prisoners"" persona, darker than some Russian Imperial stouts. Jet-black bodied with mahogany highlights and a dark, mocha-brown head... darker than many a beers body color. The taste is when he turns the tables on you... solid, bitter coffee carried by full malts that add just a touch of sweetness to laugh in your face as he rubs it into the concrete. Heavy, strict and unforgiving. If you dont like him... Koff says, ""Piss off. Someone else will."" Im happy to call him a friend.

The pour is just fantastic, thick syrupy grape juice colored nectar.  The aroma is mild - likely due to the mellowing of the hops.

Color, a thorough black, firmly opaque, with a flourishing, brown, cakey head, puffy, crusty, elegantly crumbling down. A bewitching brunette.
Aroma is sinfully dark, and smooth, carefree, untroubled, untrammelled. Espresso notes, rich and bitter, emerge and dominate, but not suffocating the essentially smooth and creamy character. Smooth and bitter, it may seem contradictory, but that is the way with complex personalities. A pleasure to drink deep into the nose, offering further complexities the furhter along we go.
On first taste, a great blaze of bitterness, that soon mellows. Excellent texture, perfect play ont hetongue, long, tasty finish.
Full-bodied, full-flavored, sturdy and spectacular mouthfeel, giving away associations of molasses, rum, raisins, chocolate, warm, rich, lush, giving.
This is the stuff, I kept thinking, and felt the desire to nothing but luxuriate in its company. Let the world shut off around me, neglect thoughts of duller cares, and let this magnificent creation perform its work upon me.

Pours a midnight pitch black color that sits underneath a full brown head that is both frothy and creamy, and is about an inch thick.  The aroma is rich and roasted, with notes of espresso, chocolate liquor, port, and burnt raisins.  While fully roasty in the aroma it is missing that astringent husky burnt characteristic that is found in many American porters and stouts, this makes the aroma on this beer quite a bit more smooth.  The taste is full and creamy, and coats my mouth and tongue in a pleasing way.  This beer is quite smooth, and is deceivingly full of roasted flavors.  I get notes of espresso, burnt raisin, dark chocolate, hints of sherry and port.  The body of this beer is quite nice, it is smooth and creamy, with a thickness that is quite hearty without being too heavy.
Sampled August 2004
Pours with a prodigious, rich brown head that is quite impressive.  The beer itself is a deep black color.  It is lightly sweet up front, but quickly leads to rich dark malt flavors that are redolent of espresso, burnt raisins and chocolate.  This is fairly light bodied, but has a lingering palate that is dominated by a roast malt astringency, which really helps to balance out this beer.  This beer has some really nice rich flavors without being heavy.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Fluffy, dense head like an ice cream float, light brown in color.  Very nice.  Lacing is a bit blotchy but respectable.  Nose is lightly sour woody, lots of berries, and a hint of molasses and vanilla extract.  Only faint roastiness.  Flavor reveals again the bright woody bite but foregrounds the roastiness a little bit more.  Also some shades of the acidic dark berry.  And then there's a strange flavor that I can only equate (and only approximately) to the sudsy head of a root beer float (but not the rest of the float).  Weird.  Finish is not as complex as Id hope.  Some dark caramel and creamy malts creep in, but otherwise the flavor kind of falls off rather quickly.

1803,"2004-07-14",4.0,"Bottle into tulip glass.  Thanks to Suttree (my Secret Santa) for this one.  Smell was roasty and toasty, definitely full of malt, with dark chocolate notes and a funkiness that I can only describe as reminiscent of damp green vegetables (that brought the score down a bit).  It poured with a huge light brown head, creamy to rocky in texture; opaque black in the glass.  The taste was dominated by a roast coffee flavor that was nicely full and strong.  It was tainted, however, by the flavorful analog to the veggie smell; thankfully, that was barely noticable, and after the first few sips, you either get used to it or it goes away.  Nice finish carries the roasty toasty malt flavors for a good amount of time.  In light of the strength of the flavor, the mouthfeel was on the watery side, but since this is a porter and not a coffee stout, thats understandable.  Despite the medium body, it was smooth and creamy.  I like when a beer (especially porter) can fill the mouth with taste; this one definitely does.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Aroma of subdued plum, raisin, and molasses, gains more roastyness as it warms and gets a bit more complex in the malts. Dustings of cocoa and soft smoked wood emerge as well.

Taste has a smooth, well rounded roasty feel, hardly overbearing at all, just a whole lotta smooth. Easy going black malts with a bit of sweet chocolate roast. Nice earthy backing of smokey malts that still maintains a strong base of roast. Touches of tangy prunes, some molasses, and darker toffee keep some interesting sweeter tones over the top of the roast. Finish has very nice mixture of both sweet and roasted characteristics with a softly drying lofty edge via moslty chocolate.

Feel is quite smooth, sweet and roasty tones always switching within the medium full body. Slightly dry finish with a certain tang left over.

The flavor is amazing... roasts, smokiness, sweet malts leading into a mildly smoky, bitter and dry grainy finish. Some semblance of hops in the finish, but nothing overwhelming. Strong chocolate front in mid taste.. perhaps the most perfect dessert beer EVER! Sweet malt base...seriously..i have a new favorite porter!","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

33 cL bottle, snifter.  Chocolate, figs and caramel play first fiddle in this brew.  There is a strong supporting cast of cranberries, cherries and a soft alcohol touch.  Deep black, stout-like, body with a great tan head.  Moderately sweet flavor becomes a lightly sweet, lightly bitter finish.  All the aromas transpose nicely to the flavor.

Dry burnt roasty aroma, lightly nutty with some interesting tobacco or maple smoke in there as well.  Flavor opens up with a dry cocoa powder mixed in with dark, rich roasted barley.  Flavor is not as powerful or full as zwyiec, but what it lacks in sheer force of flavor, it makes up in balance and restraint.  Good solid roast lingers on, more light smoke adding a slight astringency.  Very good. I would be interested to mix this with some zwyiec porter.  Alcohol magnificently concealed.  8/5/8/4/171998 bottle consumed 11/04  This is vinous, oily, smooth and balanced.  Sweet, with light roast notes, plenty of toffee, and a hint of madeirazation.  Lightly bitter, slight coffee tinged finish that has a long even lingering presence.  Ages marvelously.1997 bottle  but then here was a heavily oxidized, poorly aged bottle, so my theory goes out the window.  Hard to believe this big of a change could occur from 98 to 97.  Pretty sure it must have been the conditions under which it was kept.  2007 bottle drunk on 10/3/07Hmmm, its good, with a creamy-sweet and rich chocolate maltiness.  The poignant berry-like tartness that Id like from a baltic porter wasnt really all that well represented.  I kept trying to find some outstanding things, but just kept being very happy with the warm, easygoing malty tones and drank it down quite unceremoniously, in the end.  Some sweeter honey notes are interesting, and lots of plum/raisin do the trick, but uhhh, ya, not much to say here.  Perhaps its better very fresh, as this had a little age on it and the older vintages (recently had a 97 and a 96) had been very inconsistent (though quite good when they were on).  Dosent seem unfiltered any more, and though the malts were comforting, the carbonation was weak and the finish a bit watery.  Score is for this recent bottle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1803,"2004-02-18",3.9,"As I did age this porter for many, many moons, close to 9 months! The body is completely opaque…. the head is a rich and frothy toffee colored storm cloud… it’s a Beautiful thing! 
 The nose is rich with mocha, a note of dark spiced rum, espresso… it’s just chocolate malts all the way home! Oh Baby this is GOOD! The flavor is a bitter/sweet glass of coco and raisins. Creamy and delicious! Brings some woodsy notes of oak, dates, figs, and an unforgivable presence of smoky charred chocolate malts. This reminds me of the malted milk ball candy, Whoppers. This Baltic P has an amazing palate, and finishes with a somewhat dry fruity tastiness.

Body starts with a good dark malty sweetness, some oxidization notes and a softer roasty finish.  Seems to have aged quite well.

Original rating 8/28/02: Robust to the max.  Thick rich black appearance with a pillowy tan head. Hardly any recognition of its relatively high alcohol content.  Great sweet aftertaste masks the alcohol and gives it a full, almost oily mouthfeel.  Complex malty undertones bring out a roasted flavor that is nicely hopped.

Excellent roasted malt flavor that is still abundant well after the glass has been returned to the table.  Highly recommended brew!","Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, USA","kmeves"
1803,"2002-05-23",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2004 Two years past its best by date. One of the best Baltic aromas i've experienced.  Mild, yet stunningly complex with soft notes of baked black currants and molasses. Hints of almonds, butter, concorde grapes, roasty whiffs of malt, and vinous notes; some cardboard (oxidation) as the beer warms.    Creamy, feathery soft carbonation. Starts moderately roasty followed up with rich maltiness, charred chewiness, and an acidic, abundant black licorice finish. Still gaining much more complexity after many years in the bottle and becoming more elegant, seemingly by the day. Thus far, the most elegant Baltic Porter out there.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1803,"2002-04-12",3.8,"This is available in bottles at North Peak Brewing in Traverse City, Michigan, and from El Kabongs fridge, also in Traverse City.  It is big, black, and fruity (smoked plums and dried cherries).  The body slides darkly away from you as you go, but its a pretty intriguing beer.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
1803,"2002-04-12",4.1,"Im all over the board with this one. I get so aggravated when I cant pin one aspect of the aroma down, but theres something down in there, fruity, sweet, as Ducati mentions, maybe raisin? Delightfully thick and hearty, all the roasted tones you would expect. Excellent bitter coffee at the very end of a substantial finish.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

1803,"2002-02-24",3.5,"Well it set itself just perfect. Black, tan foam sheeting up through a creamy body, smelled a bit like coffee from further away. Then I nosed in and there was something very interesting in there -- a bit of sasparilla and then the rest of a good porter. Roasty, malty honts of cacao, coffee. The texture and sweetness are just about perfect. If Jen wasnt so good at detecting high wort temp errors this wouldve tasted even better.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
1803,"2002-02-17",4.3,"an amazingly wonderful example of the Baltic porter.  Smokey, chocolately with a touch of bitterness.  Thin, brown head that lasts the entire glass.  If anything were to be added or taken away it would ruin this fine, fine beer.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"

The flavour is chcolatey, figgy, plummy, and slightly bitter.  My first expirience with this style and it was quite good.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
1803,"2002-01-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2004 A very good, if not a little weak, Baltic Porter. Lots of roasted malts and very little bitterness. An oily smooth after-taste. abv is well hidden. (3.7) Re-rate. The importers, B. United International, were far thinking enough to have taken a number of cases of this beer and lay them down. That was in 1996. How is it 7 years later? Marvelous. Pours very black with a nice beaded head and a huge roasted nose. The hop oils are still around in the nose as well. This is so smooth that it is hard to remember that it is a strong ale. The hops are very subdued after 7 years and the once burnt flavors have matured into an amazingly pleasant roastiness. As balnced a strong porter as one will find.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

1803,"2001-03-09",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2006 First off, Im now a full-fledged convert
of the Baltic porter style.  Anyway, this beer is strong and chocolatey.  Aroma is full of dark fruits.  Flavor is almost like cocoa, with more dark fruits.  Very nice opaque dark brown color, with a dark tan head.  Excellent strong porter. 
Rerate: 2000 bottle sampled in 2006. Poured at 60 deg F, probably warmed close to 70 deg by the end of the glass. Potent but balanced aroma of roast/ash and bittersweet cocoa, some soy sauce (in a good way). First sip is a revelation as that brown foam passes the lips like whipped cream, setting the stage for a full velvety mouthfeel. Despite the fullness, its barely sweet at all, with a nice dry roasty finish and notes of coffee in between. I love this combination of full body and dryness, and its so hard to find. Outstanding when fresh, beautiful aged.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
1803,"2001-02-10",2.3,"Pours with a small head, poor retention.  Has an annoying woody aftertaste.  I would recommend at near room temperature.","Ohio, USA","cartel99"
