2709,"2015-10-14",3.7,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a slight hazy bronzed yellow color with a fast rising carbonation rising to fill a two finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Lacing was mainly speckled in a messy sort of way.
The smell started off with sweet freshly cut grass running into slight sweet citrusy notes.
The taste was moderately grassy sweet. A dry sweet semi-grassy aftertaste slides into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs really light for this one. Im not minding that. A sweet sticky dryness clings to my tongue nicely.
Overall, this was a pretty nice American Pale lager that I would have again and definitely would be nice with its respected food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

The mouthfeel is crisp enough, but suffers slightly from the pointy, tongue-poking bubbliness, perhaps a bit over the top to really showcase the maltiness which is otherwise throughly enjoyably and not straight pale malts, there are bockish traits in there and a small, but fresh wheat character.

2709,"2014-03-10",3.7,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a lager glass. There was no freshness date.

Appearance: Golden/honey hue. Mostly clear with a slight haze. Plenty of consistent carbonation visible. Pours to an average sized, off white, foamy head which laces and retains fairly well.

Smell: Slight citrusy aroma, but distinct dark malts as well. Mild nose though.

Taste: Its so hard to find a good, low ABV, craft lager these days. Jacks Abby is a brewery that specializes in craft lagers, so its not too surprising that theyd be able to pull off a truly sessionable, flavorful pale lager in the form of Jabby Brau. This is essentially an old school ""Premium Lager,"" only done much better than the macro varieties.

The best way to describe the taste (and pretty much everything about this beer) would be taken verbatim from BJCP style guideline for category 1C. Ill paraphrase: Crisp and dry flavor with some nutty malt sweetness, maybe even some rustic graininess. Distinct hop presence here in the form of mild citrus and floral notes to give the beer true hop character without making it seem like anything other than the pale lager it is. There is some starchiness on the backend, though it leaves little aftertaste. Nothing quite amazing, but definitely impressive for a low gravity lager. 

Drinkability: This is exactly what you expect in a lager: the mouthfeel is on the thinner side, but not watery. Plenty of carbonation, though it goes down smooth and is thirst quenching. Its tempting to let this warm up to bring more flavor out, but I dont think its worth sacrificing the refreshing drinkability for just a bit more flavor. At only 4.5% ABV, Jabby Brau is indeed an American session beer, though you dont have to wait for warm weather to appreciate it.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

This lagers intricate spicy and fruity hop nose relax in a prickly, lean mouthfeel where soft cereal flavors serve as a foundation for merriment.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam tops the misty straw blond.
-The finish is a tad forgettable.
-The flavor profile doesnt seem as deep as the aroma?
-This beer is meant for a krug.
-If you like this, Germany has a few hundred beers of the same caliber!

2709,"2013-01-31",4.2,"In short: A no-style toasted and grassy golden thirst lager of exceptional quality.  Wow!
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh two weeks after purchase from the brewery, bottle given to me by lushawn, thanks a lot Shawn.
The look: Crystal clearn golden-blond body topped by a medium white with medium retention.
In long: Nose is has a pleasant sun toasted hay, that fresh lager smell that I can never put into words, grassy noble hops.  Taste is an exercise in freshness, the true lager character coming through, boiled egg whites (Im the only one on the planet who gets this from some clean lagers), grainy cereals with a definite freshly picked sun dried hay character, good amount of grassy noble hops, a light touch of caramel.  Finish has a mild bitterness and toastiness and dry grass add a dryness that makes you want to go back for another sip right away.  Full chewy body with bubbles that are a bit too hard.  Except for beers like Heater Allen Coastal and a few others I havent had an American bottled thirst lager that was as satisfying this Jabby Brau.  I cant wait for the tickers to start sharing a bottle between 6 of them and thrash the score of this fine fine beer. What a highly drinkable beer, a 500ml bottle just wasnt enough, but for a good thirst lager like this one I dont think Id find any bottle size big enough if it doesnt require two handles.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
