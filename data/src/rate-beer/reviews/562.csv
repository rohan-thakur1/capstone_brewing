562,"2014-08-17",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 11-28-12- 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a ruby-copper colored brew with a one finger white head. The head has a decent retention eventually fading to leave a decent level of retention. 

Smell  The smell is heaviest of fruit and some malt. The fruit is largely of a darker nature with cherry and plum as well as some lighter notes of apple. The malty flavors are of a bready aroma and when mixed with the fruit and a lighter boozy aroma create a pleasant nose overall.

 Taste  The taste starts out of darker fruit flavors. The fruit flavors are mainly of a cherry flavor up front with some notes of a raisin mixed within. As the taste advances the raisin grows stronger and some caramel flavors some to the tongue. These are quickly followed by a lighter yeasty flavor which when combined with the rest of the flavors produce a rather pleasant fruity and yeasty flavor with an ever so light spice flavor that is mixed within. At the end a light alcohol flavor comes to the tongue and when mixed with the rest and a sweeter sugary flavor (almost candy like) leave a rather pleasant aftertaste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on the creamier side with a carbonation level that was just below average. Both are rather nice for the style as they are good for the dark fruit and lightly boozed flavors of the brew.

 Overall  A quite decent and rather easy drinking dubbel. Give it a go if you have the chance.","","Darkmagus82"

It is a touch phenolic and boozy as well with nice notes of caramel malt, over ripe fruit, sweet bready yeast and raw sugar. To start there is a very sweet rich malty and boozy brandy-like base full of caramel, brown sugar or Belgian candied sugar like notes. From there each sip reveals a different estery, fruity, or phenolic flavor note like sweet red apples, peach, apricot, and pear.

562,"2013-08-12",3.4,"2013.08.12 - Goose Island Pere Jacques - 12oz bottle in goblet glass. 2012 Vintage. Bottled 10/18/12.

Aroma: Agree with reviewer below, a bit banana bread, a bit malt. 

Appearance: Pours around 15 on SRM scale. A rich medium caramel tan. A bit of carbonation on pour, but not much at rest. A bit of a ring.

Taste: Sweetness, basically. Raisin, candied fruit... Tastes in the ballpark of a barley wine more so than a dubbel, which is not a bad thing, just seems mischaracterized.

Palate/Mouthfeel: fairly thin. 

Overall: Mixed feelings. If I were cut off from my favorite Belgians, and Ommegang went of of business then Id certainly enjoy this, but better options exist. Could be the best thing Anheuser-Busch makes, though. Itd be nice if the impact the sale to AB had was to make this brew available in every crappy bar and restaurant in America but I doubt that.

Hint of heat, some nutmeg notes in the back.  The palate is medium bodied, the fruit yeast leads to a lingering finish.

562,"2012-10-16",4.2,"(bottle bottled on 6/2011) Pours a clear dark red color with a very thin tan head that forms a tight ring around the glass.  Aroma is strong and expressive, with big scents of dark fruits like dried cherries, plums, and dark bread (kind of pumpernickle-like).  Theres also a bit of red vines licorice and light booze with some faint vanilla.  The cherry is really showcased here, and this is basically all I look for in a well-constructed dark Belgian beer.  The flavor is much the same as the aroma, with flavors of cherry, plum, light caramel, and a slight tang reminiscent of unripe plum or cherry skin.  Finish is faintly bready, but its far more plum jammy (like Italian plums) and I really dig that flavor and finish.  Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is perfect and soft.

The aroma was of a moderate caramel malt and a sweet Belgian yeast with notes of dark fruit (raisons, figs & plums), banana, green apple and a slight alcohol tinge.

The taste was malty-sweet with notes of caramel and green apple early on and then took on a strong dark fruit presence with a touch of banana and had a slight red wine alcohol finish. The flavor lasted a decently long time proceeding the swallow with a sweet fruity taste left behind.

Mouthfeel was almost medium in body and dry in texture with a strong ticklish carbonation.

562,"2012-05-20",3.6,"Ive managed to corral enough beers to do a 3 year vertical tasting. 

2012: Poured a translucent caramel brown with a decent, but quickly dissipating head. Very effervescent. Almost soda-like. Not as many esters as I expected. Aroma overall is subdued, in fact. Tastes of sharp caramel and toffee sweetness. Some cherry tartness, too. Not that many esters. Very bubbly at first but full, overwhelming sweetness at the end. I liked this better than expected. (6, 4, 8, 4, 15: 3.7)

2011 - Appearance is exactly the same. The aroma is drastically different. All hints of caramel is gone. In its place are strong phenolics. Mostly banana and clove. Leathery, too. Some breadiness and toffee flavors, but the banana and clove flavors are much more pronounced. Carbonation and caramel sweetness are much less pronounced. Its amazing what an extra year will do to drastically change the character of a beer. (7, 4, 6, 3, 13: 3.3).
2010 - Lets face facts, Im a bit drunk now, so detailed reviews arent going to happen. Just know that the 2010 version finds a nice balance between the malty sugariness of the 2012 version and the strong phenolic character of the 2011 version. 2010 is spicier and some vanilla comes into play, too.

Out of the bottle, Pere Jacques pours a hazy brown amber color, with a medium fluffy white head. Decent retention, but the head eventually fades to a ring around the glass. No noticeable lacing. 

Sweet caramel malt, ripe plums and figs, slightly medicinal alcohol aroma, yeasty Belgian spiciness.

The flavor starts and stays sweet all the way through. Combined with the emerging alcohol, there is a boozy candy sensation. Spice from the Belgian yeast and some dark fruit flavors enter the mix. Mild hop presence at the end, still accompanied by a varied palette of spices. Too sweet for me.

The mouthfeel is a bit strange. It starts a bit crisp, but after the alcohol comes through in the taste, it develops an almost watery presence. It feels like it slides down my throat. Carbonation seems a bit low.

pours a dark ruby red color with a two finger yellowish beige head that has very good retention, slowly settling into a thick lasting cap. Soapy lacing left behind.

Spicy aroma that is countered by some bread, dark fruit, alcohol and faint hops. Hints of clove, cinnamon and pepper along with some plum, raisin and dark berry. The spice is a bit overpowering in the nose.

Full bodied and complex with a nice balance of sweet malt, zesty spice, sweet dark fruit and alcohol heat.

App.:  Clear deep copper with a so-so tan head.
  
Aroma:  Rich malts, lots of dark dried fruits and brown sugar, cola- or root beer-like minty herbals, notes that veer into chocolate territory, so sumptuous and sweet and inviting, light playful esters, a hint of nuttiness and spiciness, really fruity, maybe a hint of yeast and citrus peel?, really nice and approachable.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, somewhat restrained effervescence with a few prickly bubbles.
  
Flav.:  Lots and lots of rich malts, quite fruity, dark dried fruits, brown sugar, less of the minty herbals and other notes, some banana Weizenbock-like esters, thoroughly pleasant, still hints of citrus peel, a little nutty, spicy and woodsy, veering towards chocolate/vanilla, nice; lightly sweet with sufficient balancing bitterness and a long, sweet, gooey fruity malt finish with a little warming alcohol and a touch of mintiness.

Served in a goblet. Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of a light amber hue. Off-white head with a tad bit of lacing, though nothing substantial. Nose brings a bit of caramel and a small amount of dark fruits. A bit of light sweetness.

The taste is a bit bland, as there really arent any complexities showing through and there is just a generic dark malt and fruit combination without much more there. Mouth is a bit creamy on a medium body. Drinks okay, but this is a bit less than the type of Belgian-style ale than I expect from Goose.

The nose is big and fruity with a ton of raisin, red grape, and some spiciness. 

The taste is similar, it is slightly twangy with the said yeast notes and a heightened amount of malt flavor in the taste. It is a bit watery though which is the main qualm I have with this beer.

562,"2011-01-08",3.8,"Goose Island is one of those breweries I had heard quiet, low whispers about, but never saw in person.  When I saw that their circulation had extended all the way to Seattle it was sort of like spotting a moose for the first time.  You know what it is, youve seen pictures, you even know people who know people who have seen a moose and/or enjoyed a Goose Island Beer, but it doesnt quite register.  Naturally, as with a moose, I had to have it, and so I notched an arrow in my bow of currency spending and bought two bottles of their beer, one of which is the Pere Jacques 2010.  The classy French name disguises it in the forest of wines, but one knows it for a good beer the moment the liquid is in the glass.  Its a red and mahogany bodied beer, growing a thin, fuzzy light brown head as it reclines and settles into the curves of the cup.  The aroma is sweet and creamy, touching the senses with a touch of tangerine and orange, and a kiss of cinnamon and raisin to accent the sugars.  Its a dessert aroma, but fits as a high-note to the end of any kind of rich meal.  The flavor matches the aroma, approaching the sweeter side of the scale with a lot of carbonation to push the sugars around the palate.  Flavors of pineapple and orange push to the edge of cloying without tipping over the edge, restrained somewhat by the sharper edge of hops.  This is an excellent brew for anybody who likes sugar, but is afraid their beer might be more closely related to soda than a proper beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Appearance a vibrant amber with a thin white head, a stream of small bubbles rising to the top.  Aroma of strawberry jam, toast, slightly tart, rather sweet, more on the soft side but not faint, just a nice balance.  Taste is rather smooth with an alcohol backing, sweet, still encompassing that toast with strawberry jam flavor, a bit of Belgian candi sugar, definitely full bodied.

562,"2010-12-20",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. 2010 edition. Bottled on 4/13/10. This is the third beer Ive imbibed over the past few months from a four-pack. Consumed on 12-19-10. Aroma features tart apple, candy sugar, bran muffin, plum, bubblegum, caramel, and toffee. Tartly dry and perfumey smell. Not the strongest aroma, but complex. The smell is almost as much barley wine as strong Belgian ale. Pours a very nice, dark red. Really cool color. Much suspended particulate makes the liquid cloudy but not opaque. Small amount of wispy beige head. If the head were more impressive, I probably would have given the appearance a 5. Sweet taste features cotton candy, dark fruit, and butterscotch pudding flavors. Tart dryness in the finish. The sweetness dominates the taste at first, but increasingly the tartness becomes a significant factor. Not much aftertaste to speak of. Full body. Fizzy and lively in the palate. Overall, Goose Island Pere Jacques is quite good, but it doesnt quite cross the line into very good, let alone great.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Really pretty smooth, creamy mouthfeel, good to hold in the mouth.  ABV completely masked.  Notes of butter and dark, tart jam.

Very nice aroma to this one.  Sweet caramel malts and Belgian candi sugar, with a lot of dark dried fruit.  Belgian yeast is evident.  The flavor is subtle but good.  A nice sweetness level, not overly sweet as some American BSAs can be.  Candi sugar, molasses, spice, plum, fig, and Belgian yeast are the predominant flavor notes.  Decent palate, medium bodied with medium-high carbonation level.  Another nice Belgian-style ale from Goose Island this is.  Not a game-changer, but definitely one Id revisit.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Amazing funky, yeasty, heady, off-ish, sharp sour aroma with what I though was a hop edge. Sour taste but no real hop finish. Must be lots of fresh yeast knocking around. Written ""Belgian Style"" on the bottle but Ive never tasted anything like this before. Pity there is little substance to back up the massive sour ale nose. Maybe I should leave one to lay for up to 5 years as the bottle suggests.","IRELAND","canicule"

562,"2010-07-25",3.7,"Location: 12 oz bottle from New Beer, Vintage 2007, 7/17/10


Aroma: The nose has caramel malts, lots of ripe fruits, a bit of spice, earth, and yeast

Appearance: A rather cloudy orange-amber colored pour with a small off-white head 

Flavor: The taste is rather sweet up-front, a lot of sweet malts, and a bit of spicy yeast

Palate: The body is medium, with that spicy yeast feel to it, and almost no burn

Overall Impression: 
I found this beer to be rather nice, even if it is a touch sweet.  The age probably helped round this one out, as I thought it felt very well-rounded.  It has a pretty decent complexity to it.  The super sweetness does take a way from my enjoyment a bit, but I like what they were trying to do here.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

562,"2010-07-24",3.7,"2010 vintage.  Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass.  The bee pours a dark amber to slightly light brown color, with a faint head that disappears quickly.  A slightly thin nose comes at first, followed by more inviting notes that come alive, as the sample warms.  A beautiful note of candied sugar, and perhaps just the slightest note of grassy hop.  The palate is richly malty, without being over-the-top, nor out-of-style.  Special B, rich, burnt sugar, and molasses come through, along with a subtle yeast ester profile.  Carbonation suits the flavor profile, acting in a complimentary fashion, rather than working as a detriment.  The finish is slightly sweet.  Overall, a nicely crafted beer that, while not quite competing with the best from across the Atlantic, makes a fine showing, indeed.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

The bouquet is not intense, but is discernibly sweet and fruity, though it finishes with a balancing hint of sour.

562,"2010-07-10",3.8,"2007 Bottle. Pours a murky brown with lots of chunky, tan sediment (shouldve poured more carefully), and a frothy light tan head that drops to a thin skin at the surface. The nose is of full, round, sweet, brown sugar-like malt, raisins, grapes and light pepper. Medium to full-bodied and silky-soft with a vinous and slightly resinous (almost woody) finish; nice palate. The flavor is a deeper, richer version of the nose with big, fruity, sugary malt up-front, followed by lesser notes of sweet spice and light pepper along with slightly woody and spicy/resinous hops. Leaning a bit too much toward the sweet side of the spectrum for me to ""love"" it, its still quite good.

The nose is a bit Delerium beers with a simple, but pleasant, sugary malt; light candi sugar and toffee, mild raisin and cake notes are beginning to emerge, some spicy phenols, and alcohol warmth.  The flavor is similar but subtle darker (bitter) notes to separate from the sugary sweetness; certainly cake-like notes are prominent with hints of dark chocolate, still light candi sugar, light raisin, light phenols, and still some clove-like spicing.  The palate is a bit light but seemed to work well with this one; medium, nearly lively, silky, warm, and coating.  The finish is long and lingering with cake, dark chocolate, clove, and some light sugar.  A bit hard for me to rate because it is not what I usually look for in a BSDA; the malt richness is lacking, the malt depth is lacking, the palate is thin for the style, and the yeasty notes are fairly insignificant.  However, the simple subtleties, the way the palate supported those subtleties, and the way the different sweeter notes worked well together to minimize how sugary it was.  The more I had, the more I really enjoyed it.  Still a beer that is very young but something that I would try again an definitely try to hold on to for a while to allow the malts to develop.  From such a great brewery, this is an upgrade from the Belgians I have tried from them.  Looking forward to Sophie in my cellar.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Neatly arranged sweetness falls in line with delicious cookie spices, but the result comes across as a little less than beery.

562,"2010-04-26",4.0,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. The bottle reads Pere Jacques 2009 and it also has a ""bottled on"" date of 10/05/09.

Appearance: The pour only produces a small off white head which fades out quickly leaving a rich reddish amber liquid naked and exposed. Only a thing ring of lace remains around the edge of the glass. This lacing is slick and sides down the glass as I drink leaving nothing behind.

Smell: Its aroma is very sweet, estery and malty. It is a touch phenolic and boozy as well with nice notes of caramel malt, over ripe fruit, sweet bready yeast and raw sugar.

Taste/Palate: To start there is a very sweet rich malty and boozy brandy-like base full of caramel, brown sugar or Belgian candied sugar like notes. From there each sip reveals a different estery, fruity, or phenolic flavor note like sweet red apples, peach, apricot, and pear. On to the finish, and now I get leafy hop spice and mild bitterness moving in. Overall though, it remains well on the sweet boozy side in the finish. On the palate it has a medium to full body with a slick sticky texture.

Notes: This is a very interesting and complex beer which I think was still a bit young and could use some time to age.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

Overall, this is a VERY good beer, worthy of my first-ever rating.  I dont think its one I want to drink very many of, but its a great beer to have one or two of an evening or maybe to start off with this one and then switch to a lesser beer if you want to keep drinking.  This beer is 8% ABV and packs a pretty good wallop.  I am 61"" and about 270 lbs, had 3 fajitas for dinner, and had a buzz after one beer.

Hazy brownish-red that seems to glow from within. Small white head that leaves spotty lacing.

Aroma of dark fruit, raisins, toffee, banana, spice and a hint of alcohol - surprisingly, a little mild.

Fruit (both the mysterious ""dark fruit"" I often taste and banana) and toffee predominately. Also notice some nuttiness and spiciness. The spiciness builds at the end and almost turns a little bit bitter. Turns a little more earthy as it warms.

The body seems both syrupy and watery at the same time. Moderately high carbonation and almost has a dry spicy finish but the ""syrupiness"" prevents that.

 To make an belgian abbey style for others than belgians in their right enviroment should be met by a big sign saying: ""Dont Go There"" And normally it shows that the attemps is not very interesting - and surely not worth to be called belgian abbey - But then again, it should keep inovative brewers to keep trying to wrestle this type of beer around. This Goose Island named after an belgian Abbot, is another american try: Here goes..The pour is dark kobber golden with noteable yeast-leftovers moshing around. The head is small and tanned that tends to fade out. The nose is nice and intense. It has a perfumic dominans that reminds me of sweet marzipan, chocolate and sweet oranges. In the taste you can tell the influence and you can almost see the belgian idols somewhere in the distance. Its sweet with a slight spicyness. Caramel, vanilla and malts with a sharp alcohol feeling in the very back of your mouth in the end. I find it a bit to sweet to be well balanced - but maybe its just me.

It doesnt quite fulfill my notion of a Dubbel, but its been awhile since my last. The beer is very sweet with a malt flavor that could almost work in a barleywine. It packs a lot of fruit flavors, including plums, grapes and overripe peaches. Its a very nice Belgian yeast strain for an American brewery with good phenols. The beer is right on the edge of booziness, but the balanced sweetness keeps it from going too far.

562,"2009-06-10",3.5,"2007 vintage.
Appearance  Pours a medium brown color with a dark yellowish tan head about half a finger in size. The head dissipates quickly and leaves a small cap and ring. When held up to light, it turns into a beautiful amber orange color.

Smell  There is that Belgian yeast smell! On top of the bready yeast (that lingers more toward crackers really) there is a lot of sweet fruits and malt. This smells like white grapes, in a very wine-ish way. 

Taste  The Belgian yeast doesnt overpower the other flavors of this beer like so many other Belgian style beers I have had, which is a very welcome addition! Lots of white grapes, spices, and a little bit of bready-ness. This seems to have smoothed out and become a very mellow, well balanced beer.

Mouthfeel  A little thicker than I wanted, but it is by no means thicker than what is expected. Has a medium mouthfeel that is in no way watery.

Drinkability  This is a pretty solid brew. A year and a half has done this beer well. Definitely a great sipping beer.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

Lots of bits floating throughout the body and a slow but steady steam of carbonation.  Very light sweetness (like warm cotton candy) in the taste and an incredibly smooth mouthfeel with a slight alcohol kick at the back of the throat.  Pretty decent lacing too.

Fairly rich, heavy malt takes up a lot of the aroma on this one, with notes of rich toffee, almond cookie, minor alcohol, some roasted nuts, and sweet fruit.

Quite heavy sweetness/richness, not cloying but very slightly to balanced on that side of things.  More fig and raisin notes and less nutty notes than i was expecting. Also, a good amount of chewy cookie, some sugar crystals and sweet malt.  Minor earthy hop bitterness finally makes its presence known right in the finish alongside a good amount of rich malts.

562,"2009-01-27",4.0,"Their Matilda blew me away so I was very happy to come across another Belgian offering from Goose Island. More of a Dubbel per style, but safe to just call it a Belgian Strong I was real impressed from the two I sampled and enjoyed this beer thoroughly. Rich, dark, fermented fruit aromas. Mildly spiced and musty. Burnt sienna in color, the pour produced a frothy beige head and spotty lacing. Sweet and malty on the palate, minor alcohol presence, and medium bodied. Faint bitter aftertaste. Plums, cherries, raisins oh my...the dark sugary fruits are bountiful in a nice robust flavor. Balanced somewhat by a noble hop presence providing a slight bitterness. Dank and musty with the trademark earthy qualities. Hints of vanilla and clove. Straightforward goodness, I am impressed time and time again of the wonders that Goose Island produces, and I am surely content with this brew.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

Ive been aging this one for about a year, and the flavors have come together really well- cola, honey, citrus, plum, raisin, coriander, and pineapple.  Also has a slight dill pickle flavor, which sounds strange, but actually goes really well with the rest of the palate.

A nice dark brown pour, crisp and lively carbonation and a whole universe of floaties in there.

A- Pours a dark peach with an ample head which fades to lacing.

S- Smell is sweet, cider, dark fruits, boozy.

T- Taste is very smooth, raisins, more dark fruit as in the nose, no boozy flavor to speak of that was so prominent in the nose. Sweet caramely.

M- Semi viscous with quite a bit of carbonation.

D- For 9 percent alcohol this is damn drinkable. Very smooth. I was going to hold onto this one longer but I acidentally droped the bottle and cracked the neck, didnt seem to damage the flavor and there was still ample carbonation.","California, USA","Lothore"

562,"2007-11-20",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2008 Vintage 2006 as reviewed on 11/20/07

Pours reddish brown with a beige head of a half-inch. Small particulates in suspension. The foam receded to a partial skim coat on the surface, leaving a few scarce traces of lacework.
Aromatics are fruity and vineous, with a hint of cocoa.
A large strawberry-cherry note leads off, followed by shades of red wine and faint bakers chocolate.
Plenty of phenols follow through, with lingering clove and bubblegum.
The mouthfeel is creamy and luscious. Carbonation is on the light side for style, but lends some nice drinkability.
The dubble profile is a bit off on the pallet. Drinks more like an strong dark. Light chocolate with lots of fruit and jammy. 
Strawberry marmalade barely dusted with cocoa powder.
Alcohol steps foward with some nice warmth and each sip finishes fairly quick. 
Finishes with a nod of red wine, cherry blossom honey, and a hint of hazelnut.

Not spot on in the realm of Dubble, but damn tasty and fairly complex. Looks like the aging has helped Pere along.

Vintage 2006 revisited on 6/30/08

Quite murky in appearance, with a half-inch head of dense tan. 

Dark rum, raisins, toffee, caramel, and tobacco in the nose. Cocoa-spiked bubblegum and dark fruits.

Creamy mouthfeel and slightly chewy.

Caramel, raisins, and chewy malt lead off the pallet. Mild alcohol notes pull through. Shades of nougat, vanilla, toffee, and bannana follow along. 

Finishes with some light residuals. Chewy malt and brown sugar. Dryer than I remember though.

After having a fresh one on draught at GI Clybourn, I would say that this beer improves with age up to about 1.5-2 years. This one is a bit faded compared to the one reviewed just six months ago, and the one on tap was pretty mediocre.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

The taste was much the same, just huge caramel flavor with a good dose of some alcohol.  The fruits come really secondary here, as the malty caramel masks much of everything else.  You could tell its got a little age to it.  I liked it though, seems to have aged quite gracefully.  Sweet in the finish and lingering in the aftertaste.

562,"2007-08-02",3.5,"Surprisingly spicy.  The spiciness however, seems to be trying to make up for the lack of carbonation.

562,"2007-07-26",4.2,"Distinctiveness is one of the most important criteria for me, and theres nothing else quite like Pere Jacques (at least, nothing fresh, i.e., brewed in the U.S.)  It pours a deep amber with more than a little gold tinge.  Not much head (not a problem for a sipping beer, in my opinion).  The aroma is molasses-y malt, with the alcohol coming through nicely.  It has a big sweet fruity malt taste, complex and bordering on decadent.  Its reminiscent of a cross between a Belgian Golden Ale and an old ale or some other malty style.  It has an almost perfect degree of alcohol warming.  It finishes just a little sticky, with little evidence of hops.  Incredibly satisfying without being filling.","Hartland, Wisconsin, USA","Flyer"

Some clove, phenolic, caramel, alcohol and cardboard in the nose.  The cardboard worried me - not that the brew was bad necessarily, but that it had sat on the shelves too long.  None of that in the taste, however.  Nice phenolic flavors from the yeast strain, and a tasty sweet malt flavor.

Many beers have a great aroma but disappoint when you taste them (smell better than they taste).  This beer was the first one I can remember that was the reverse of that - it smelled not so good but tasted terrific!

The aroma was a bit sour, woody/cardboard-ish, and a bit like good-beer-gone-bad.  However, undaunted, I took a sip and was quite surprised.  The beer is quite spicy up front, with a warm mouthfeel with lots of stickiness and alcohol esters up front.  This beer was served in a long-stemmed glass (looked like a wine or martini glass), and it definitely drank more like a really nice spirit than a beer.  Mouthfeel was quite smooth, like a beer that has been secondary fermented (dont know if it has or not).  To me, Goose Island beers are a bit hit&miss, but I definitely enjoyed this one.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

562,"2007-05-20",4.1,"[4 year old bottle (Early 2003 bottle, sampled April 2007), pre-production bottle saved from the Michael Jackson Beer tasting at Sheffields in Chicago]: tightly bubbled foam quickly rises out of the top of the barely labeled bottlepours clear bronze-red and at a distance, dark brown.  Carbonation is thick, full and taupe coloured.  Rich raisiny, chocolate aroma, seemingly thick with molasses & peppery spice.  Smokey, earthy flavours  slightly thinner palate than I was expecting, but soft and lively no less.  Light bitterness ensues at the end and through the finish.  Very nicely developed after 4 years8/4/8/4/17
[April 2004 production bottling, sampled April 2007]: Pours just as clear as the 4 year old, pre-production bottle, but the head is noticeably weaker and the body is not quite as red.  Softer, fruiter aroma with blueberries and strawberries instead of raisins and yeasty spiceFlavour continues the fruitiness & brings out some yeast and orange-bitter qualities.  Finish is sweet with touches of caramel and oak.  Darn good unless compared directly to the pre-production and slightly more aged bottle8/4/7/4/16
[Previous Rating, July 2003]: Saaz hops mixed with sweet green apples and ripe pears - the hops are faint and seem like they should be pronounced. . . Sweet sugary apples offer a nice front end, but need some time to ripen and fill out. . . not quite enough palate.  I would love to have a bottle of this to hang on to for a few years.

562,"2007-02-07",3.9,"Courtesy boboski.  Slightly cloudy dark brown color with thin white head.  Fruity Belgain malt, mild pit-fruit aromas, not a whole lot of yeast character on the nose.

562,"2007-02-04",3.7,"The pour is a burnt-rusty shade of orange.  Altogether this brew is almost seamlessly woven together.  Aromas are toffee, earth, and cinammon, leading into a carrot-cake dry sweetness in the flavor.  Hints of peat, musty yeast, and spice.

562,"2007-02-02",4.1,"Pours a cloudy, deep copper/rust color.  Looks great.  Aroma is pretty enticing as well.  Theres some sugar and toffee to it, a slight cotton candy-ness, but also plenty of funky, almost cheesy yeast aromas.  Taste is full on caramel at first, lots of caramel sweetness.  The dryness from the yeast helps cut through and had some earthy and funky notes.  This continues through the finish, which is just strong enough to cut the sweetness, but not enough to dry out the mouthfeel.  Im really enjoying the balance of a dessert-like sweetness with the funky, almost cheeselike yeast qualities.  Could have been messy but this is very well made and hold itself together inredibly well.  Great mouthfeel.  A superb US-made Belgian strong.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Quite a pleasant beer, if a little sugary in the mouth. Its a very well put together beer with the hops melding seemlessly into the malt flavours. Though it tastes nothing like any Belgian beer Ive had. (74/100)","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","rpattinson"

More variety of flavor than the aroma suggests - toffee malt, fig, bittersweet chocolate, and mild rum. It dries out somewhat towards the finish with a fresh blast of spice and hops in the aftertaste. Nice blend of flavors, nice balance and contrast while intentionally remaining on the sweet side.

562,"2006-08-29",3.4,"12 oz bottle shared with malachi

Shared this with malachi on a Friday night.  It was pleasing and easy to
   drink but did not rock my world.  Still, Goose Island has turned in a solid
   effort with this one.
Aroma / Appearance - Bananas, rum, candy sugar, caramel, cherries,
   pear and malt play against each other to see which one can dominate.  They
   end up forming a nice inviting balance.  The body was a cloudy amber color
   with a thin bubbly head.  Based on the visual and olfactory feedback, this
   was lining up to be a nice beer.
Flavor / Palate - The amount of flavors relative to the nose was a
   little disappointing.  Despite that, there was still plenty going on here.
   Among the key players were caramel, honey, apples, peaches, peanut butter,
   malts and cherries.  A slightly yeastiness underlined everything giving it
   a dry feel.  The finish was pleasing, being smooth and sweet.  This was
   enjoyable and easy to drink but it did not rock my world.  Still, it is a

The whole thing stays on the sweet and fruity side throughout, at times approaching a barleywine profile but then seemingly backing off a bit and becoming more of a slightly tart, heavily fruity IPAish beer holistically.  Whatever you want to call it, it is a damned fine brew.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

The aroma shocked me, as bananas jumped out with spices and yeast (Im not used to bananas in dark malted Belgian beers and was wondering where the dark fruits were). Flavor was rich and spicey with dark fruits and candi sugar coming through. Bananas only in the background of the flavor and the alcohol came through a bit sharp. Ill bet this one is a fine aged beer to drink after a few years (this sampling was only 7 mos old from bottling). I shoulda stored it away for a little while. Impatient me.

The first thing that hits the tongue is the carbonation - an acidity that gives the immediate impression this beer will make you pucker, but that quickly subsides and the warmth of the malt takes over. The carbonation may be a bit sharp due to its aging, but it has let the body really settle out nicely. The high ABV is not readily apparent behind the very present yeast and malt.

A veritable ""fruit cocktail"" of aromas with sourish cherry, pineapple and citrus that is not overdone but rather linear and delicate. Additional light funk and wheat.

Aromas is complex and bold... sweet with mild fruit (raisins seem like a good description, maybe plum or prune, too) over a little bit of a grain that is really subtle.  Flavor is blessed with a great mix of the fruit/sweet remnants of the aroma that is followed up by a sweetness that recalls toffee.  All of this has a mild alcoholic bite to it that provides a little warmth and compliments flavors nicely.  Smoothly and masterfully blended.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Aroma is a nice and complex.  Raisin, plum, and spice along with a yeast character, really fits nicely for its style.  The flavor is yeasty with a greay roasted malt.  The second wave is very sweet, and that sweetness settles very cleanly. It is about at this time that I notice the head stays sizable for a long time and produces a great lace.   Raisin and plum provide a nice extra character and brings a bit of a tangy alcohol.  It rounds out very nicely with carmel and a mixture of the aforementioned dark fruits providing a very full and sweet character.  Nice beer.","Zionsville, Indiana, USA","atpayne"

The flavor is medium to full bodied with heavy banana fruityness. Very tart and acetic finish...crisp in all senses of the word and very VERY dry in the finish! Mildly carbonated and generally sticky in mouthfeel. Some candy sugar flavors in the finish, but once again, another portion of the beer dominated by banana. Perhaps a hint of ginger in here too?

The body was very thick, coating and creamy.  Very nice flavor.  Big caramel/molasses malts and fruit ranging form dark and dried (like raison) to pear.  Very interesting and good.  There is some spice as it warms and includes ever increasing hints of clove and banana and cinnamon.  Did not know exactly what this was when I tried it but Belgian strong makes sense.

Spicy sweet to start. Sour apple and some raisins come through with the malt. Finishes warm and spicy sour. This beer really knocked me back.

562,"2005-02-15",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2008 12 oz bottle. Tasted at 57° from a NB worthy glass. Poured reddish brown with a long lasting off white/nearly tan head.  Small sediment rests on the bottom. When the foam dies down, it coats the side of the glass.   Nice aroma of malt, prunes, raisins, and over ripe dark fruits.  The first impression is of the full mouthfeel due to the malts and the carbonation. The flavor is bready, malty, and sweet at first then shifts to chocolate?, dark fruits, earthy hops character, estery notes, with some dark brown sugar.  The finish tries to be balanced, but the hops lose out in the end to the malt and it comes of slightly sweet, but certainly not cloying.  I just had a Rochefort 10, and although this is certainly not as good as that, it is one of the best domestic beers of its style.  The alcohol is barely noticeable. This is a very, very good beer and I just heard today that it is being sold in Kansas, this is great news.

Flavor is an interesting mix of light fruits, dark fruits, a slight spice, ans a mild maltiness. Finish is a little water if you do not get a signifigant portion of the head to add creaminess. The light fruit addition to the traditional dark fruit/malt/spice belgian is what makes this beer different and interesting and quite good flavor wise.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
562,"2005-01-27",3.3,"Having tried this when it was fresh and after it has aged awhile I prefer the fresh.  The aged seems to lack any hop bite it might of had making this a little too sweet for me.  Nicely malty, sort of like a sweet plum coffee-cake with raisins.  Good lacing.  I prefered this to their Demolition, their other winter special.
Very Belgian like in the yeast.","USA","kane"

Im not sure which trappist they were shooting for here, hints at Roch 10 but I understand this is really a Chimay Blue clone, but IMO its better!

So very soft, juicy, rounded, caramelly fruity malts, perhaps a teeny bit of chocolate, a little coconut, touch of banana and phenol, sweet alcohol finish.  Did I say this was soft?  Wow!

562,"2004-10-28",4.0,"I think this in one of the better American versions of a Belgian beer out there.  Classic Belgian aroma - earthy yeast, pepper, clove, plum, cherries, toffee, caramel.  Hazy ruby brown color, tan head.  Flavor isnt quite as complex as the aroma, but still very good.  The malt, toffee, and caramel combine with pepper and clove, while the fruitiness is much more subdued than in the aroma.  Sweet, but not cloying.

Divine! Toffee meets spices, nuts, vanilla, cocoa, ...weve got dessert on the way, here! Rather light, but not shy with flavor, big sweetness, in just the right doses. 
Taste: the same and then some. Rich, thick, lush texture, big, rewarding mouthfeel...this is some nice stuff! Flavor spends its time washing all over the senses, playing here and there, leaving traces and drops of deliciousness wherever it may. 
As a frequent fan of dubbels, I find no fault at all here, and in fact see this among the higher stratum. Ive enjoying many good brews from the Goose, and Im finally ecstatic to know that they can crank out something truly stellar! Thats what this is, to me, a big, malty, sweet, tasty, nearly decadent creation. Citric notes intervene near the end, and they play well with the other flavors. 9%?

Aroma is a bit restrained at first, but pleasant with a nice fruity display of banana and raisin, bits of bready yeast, caramel, and a light interplay of alcohol proceeds within. Warmth brings it up a notch better which is accompanied by medicinal phenolic heat.

Taste is eager yet yielding of some inobtrusive raisin, dark grapes, banana, and plum. A bit vinuos in tang and alcohol, dark caramel seeps from underneath with a moderate chocolate sweeping just before the finish which gathers in slight dry leafy hops and alcohol spice with smaller hints of leftover fruits. Subtle, warm, with a classy flare of fruityness. Nice.

Feel is quite warm, well-rounded, firm, creamy fullish body, but theres a trustworthy fluffy texture that insues within the carbonation thats really nice. A well heated, covetous, complex body and character that kept me inticed the whole glass through.

562,"2004-06-11",4.2,"Bottle. Dark amber color with a thick tan head. Nose is full of fruit and yeast. As it warms, hints of banana come through. Flavor is dark fruit with some barnyard flavors. Alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering. Thick palate and wet finish.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
562,"2004-06-08",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2005 Keith-Amber color with a thin white head that stays throughout the entire drink.  Rich and hearty belgian that is full of taste and begs to be sipped.  May be a winter beer, but I can drink this any time.
Eric-Bottle given to me by keith-april 2004 (almost a year old)  pours a deep amber hue with nice smooth off-white head.  aroma of candy sugar, spice, banana, brown sugar, like a rich double.  flavors are much like the aroma-big candy sugars, clove and even hops.  The hops are present, but never detract from belgian flavors.  finish is malty with slight burnt notes and lingering spices.  palate is firm and solid.  alcohol well hidden!  I guess this was veryhot when young.  cookie like finish-very nice!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
562,"2004-06-08",4.1,"A truly top-notch Belgian style, on par with even some of the Trappists. Nice, deep mahogany color. Big, creamy, off-white head formed of large bubbles. Darkly fruity nose with hint of winter spice and gentle whiff of alcohol. Creamy mouthfeel accented by very gentle carbonation. Rich and full flavored yet delicately complex. Tasty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
562,"2004-05-30",2.8,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2004 Color somewhere between honey and strong apple cider. Not much in the nose except some faint malt and fleshy fruit. dry and a hint of sweetness at the same time but more on the dry side.Aside frome the actual mouthfeel,the only thing I can taste is a hint of malt and mild fleshy fruits. Could be this was in its infant stage as the bottle was only 6 weeks old. Perhaps a sleeper to try again come the winter holidays.
UPDATE-Tried this again almost 6 mos later. No change,still subtle and boring. Glad I didnt stock up on this.","Lake Zurich, Illinois, USA","Metalhead"
562,"2004-05-22",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2004 Pours a reddish-brown, about the color of apple cider, thin head, but thats expected. Yeast, bread, dark fruits? The yeast smell is heaviest.Taste is interesting complex. Lots of malt load with a balanced hop finish. Tastes like some sugar candy, soft fruits, some grape, banana, plum. Very tasty. Feels great in the mouth too! Excellent brew. Managed to find this at the Binnys in the Loop...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
562,"2004-04-11",4.5,"Bottle @ Goose Island Clybourne:  This wasn't on the menu, but after talking with the waitress she had some other beer options and this was one of them.  It was served in a wine goblet.  The beer pours a cloudy reddish-brown.  There was some head from a fast pour, but it was gone fairly rapidly.  There was a big, sweet nose:  yeasty, bread, some floral, some fruits with plums and raisins being most evident.  The taste was initially sweet, with a slightly sour aftertaste.  Some fruits and caramel to the taste. This made the traffic jam that I sat in to get there worthwhile!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
562,"2004-03-08",4.1,"Hazy copper color with a small off white head.  Very complex aroma of figs, nuts, honey, currant, yeast, chocolate and vanilla.  Taste was very dubbelish including dark fruits, cherries, and a slight alcohol burn.  This was very nice, thanks Floydicus!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
562,"2004-03-03",4.1,"Beautiful deep bright cherry red with some dark ambers, golds and oranges.  Bottle conditioned, VERY Hazy, but not muddy looking.  Small head, light tan, good amount of lacing.  Aroma is divine.  Fruity (bananas, nowhere as strong as some others noticed), lightly hopped and quite caramelly.
Begins medium sweet, lightly carbonated, smooth and lush.  Belgian candied sugars, light floral hops (interesting take for this style) and some moderately sweet caramel flavors.  Light orange curacao flavors on the finish mix with a touch of dry woodiness (from the hops) and some good clean yeastiness that lingers on a bit.  Consistency is way too thin for the style, but the flavor is simply amazing.  I actually found this to be relatively under-malted for a belgian strong, with a firm bitter hops presence and a good balanced yeast flavor.  Alcohol immensely well concealed.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
562,"2004-02-13",3.0,"One of the most attractive beers I have ever seen.  Reddish brown, dark and translusent.  Aroma of yeast and belgium candi.  That is it, not much flavor, pretty much sucks wind once you drink it.  Never had a beer like it, and I don't care to have another.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
562,"2004-02-08",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2009 Pre-release bottle given away at the tasting below, Feb. 04, Tasted 4/19/05. Okay, the big banana taste has really settled down now. Its still pretty prominent, but I had to get pretty far down in the glass to be reminded of it. Instead there a big pile omalt here. Toasty and caramelly, with a fruity bubble-gummy aspect. Sticky, and with a fine alcoholic mouthfeel. Much better than my first impression.

In other words, banana. Hits you in the nose as soon as your pour. Overwhelms everything else. Pours dark yellow under a thin head. Likeable, but a bit overdone.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
562,"2004-01-20",3.3,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2004 Fruity, sticky, malt aroma. Straightforward bready, fruity, caramel flavor. Almost cloying sweetness and one-dimensional. Malted heavily, some fruit extract added?","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
562,"2004-01-19",3.4,"Cloudy watermelon. Broken foam in the middle with a thick, light tan ring. Huge aromatic wall of richly sweet, fruity, earthy malts, plums, and pleasantly piney hops. Fruity esters are replaced by the phenols. Touches of rubbery, medicinal alcohol and black cherry. Soft, round body. Sandy, tiny-bubbled carbonation. Big cakey malt flavors coupled with a touch of medicine and mild acidity. Leathery malts, rubbery alcohol, and subdued esters mix with the dark fruit from the malts. Finishes medicinal, sharply alcoholic, and everlastingly chewy and malty with some underlying dark fruity esters. Lingers with leathery, plummy malts and medicine. This ones all about the malt. Solid effort, but far from awe-inspiring. Serve at cellar temperature in order to suppress the massive sweetness.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
562,"2004-01-16",3.3,"Bottle at Brewpub: They seem to keep this in bottles hidden under the counter and only reveal that they have it if you nag the daylights out of them.  A rather sweet, malty Belgian Ale effort that exceeded my expectations.  The alcohol is quite well-hidden and I found it sweeter than many Belgian brews.  Good.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
562,"2004-01-14",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2004 Mahoganey color with a creamy light brown head. Aroma is of plums, rasins, caramel and toasted malts. Flavors of plum and some touches or roasted malts up front. Some hops come through and there a caramel like taste that lingers on through the finish. Some more hops come through in the finish as well as a dry toasty feel. Quite nice. Thanks to Jokes for this one.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","frylock"
562,"2004-01-11",3.8,"FOAM series and available in bottle at brewery only while supplies last: Ruby hue with small white head and some lace. The aroma hints of earthy Belgian yeast esters, sweet bread, applesauce, plumcake, and toffee. The taste is very sweet and fruity. A minor sourness and those yeasty characteristics  provide the undertones for the flavors. A well place dash of spices are detected towards the finish. The alcohol was well hidden until the very end. The mouthfeel is soft and well rounded. The beer has now been aging for 6 months and appears to have started to become quite smooth and yummy.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
562,"2003-11-25",3.6,"Darker bronze with fluffy off-white head.  Nose is very estery with strong notes of biscuit and flour.  Very appley and fruity, as well as biscuity, somewhat dry on the tongue. Alcohol is well masked.  Not as complex as the also sugary Chimay Blue, but still a very nice gift from Goose Island...but is this the Goose Island Blue????  I don't remember that one well...","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
562,"2003-11-24",3.8,"Thanks again to BBB63 for this bottle fine brew.  It poured a large head of finely sized foamy mostly diminishing light brown colored bubbles that left behind a good lace and a carbonated hazy brown colored body.  It was interesting to not that the bubbles from the carbonation appeared to be suspended within the thick body of this brew.  It had a very nice caramel malt aroma and flavor.  The mouthfeel was smooth, vinuous and slightly tingly with a slight afterbite.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
562,"2003-11-23",4.0,"Thanks to BBB63 for giving thedm and I a bottle of this fine Belgian Strong Ale, which by the way, is one of my favorite beer styles and it is one that definitely did not disappoint me. It poured a medium sized tan head with fine-small bubbles that completely dissipated during my rating. The body had fizzy carbonation, cloudy and the hue was amber/copper. The nose consisted of caramel, fruitiness and alcohol. The flavor was sweet, fruity, caramel and alcohol from start to finish. The mouthfeel was pleasantly smooth and light-medium bodied. There was a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass. I would recommend this Belgian to anyone who enjoys drinking Belgian Strong Ales.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

Cloudy, ruby/copper/mahogany hue. Mid-sized, khaki-colored, fizzy head.
The nose is of caramel and rock candy, various fruits and alcohol.
The flavor is of sweet caramel and fruit (apple and pear). Well-balanced and grassy.
Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, astringent, lightly sweet finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
562,"2003-06-19",3.8,"I saw a comparison of this beer to Chimay written in a local paper.  The best I can do is compare this beer to the Chimay that I know; the Chimay of the past year and a half.  Say, you Chimay nay-sayers, that Chimay were to deteriorate from it's previous state in a fashion that represents the recent demise of the beer.  That is the best comparison I can make for this beer.  Pours a nice amber, copper color with little head.  The aroma is simply amazing.  Sweet and delectable, the fruits dominate the nose.  Simply a hint of what is to come.  The flavor, however, does live up to the nose.  Sharp to the point of being harsh, the flavor is unrefined.  Strong apples and sweet candi sugar seem to dominate throughout.  I think a little time would provide this beer the opportunity to mature and mellow and become really incredible.  Darker fruits and a ""ripeness"" would let itself well to this concoction.  Give it the opportunity and time will heal all wounds.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Slightly metallic, but well-balanced and interesting.  I wish they would bottle this one.

Bottled on 04/16/04, sampled on 8/7/05: Pours a rich dark copper brown with a thin cream-colored head.  Richly sweet Belgian caramel malty aroma has some bready yeasty character.
