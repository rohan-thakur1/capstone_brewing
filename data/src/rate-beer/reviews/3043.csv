3043,"2015-11-08",4.5,"Mikkeller barley wine celebrating the 40 years of existence of - still - BelgiumÂ’s most prominent beer pub. Draught at Kulminator of course, in a sherry snifter. Off-white, medium thick, regular and surprisingly stable, lightly lacing head on top of a deep, pure, clear amber coloured beer with chestnut brownish hue and refined, almost lambrusco-like fizz. Incredibly rich bouquet of all kinds of wonderful things, the kind of aroma a true beer afficionado can sniff for hours: candied orange, oxidized sherry, honey, hazelnut oil, black peppercorns, vanilla, oaky tannins, dried banana, whisky, calvados, old port wine, fermenting peaches. Very sweet onset but in a refined, candied kind of way, candi sugar and marmelade, lovely oily and vinous mouthfeel gliding smoothly over the tongue with a subtle sparkling, caramelly and honeyish malt sweetness underneath the candied sweetness, evolving into a rich and downright beautiful finish of lingering candied sweetness, honeyish malts, lightly peppery hops, a lot of drying Â’woodinessÂ’ and peppery, warming, liqueurish and slightly whisky-like alcohol only burning a bit in the throat after swallowing, but otherwise well in place. A barley wine of great finesse with a complex texture and amazingly addictive bouquet, absolutely worthy of this dignified institution of Belgian beer culture.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3043,"2014-09-24",4.8,"Happy birthday to Kulminator! Cheers to Dirk & Leen! I have been coming to the Kulminator since forever (maybe 4 years now?), it was an instrumental place in the early days of my beer tasting hobby. It is the place where I first tried beers from De Dolle, Struise, Mikkeller, De Molen & many more as well as my first Orval. I still feel very much at home there & I am happy to be seen as a regular of which there are not so many given their influx of tourists. Tasting glass drank. Surprisingly this is clear, golden amber with a spare cobweb head. Nose is good kind of oxidation, all the way, very sweet honey, lots of it, makes me almost think of mead (prob. the wine, Sauternes can be almost mead-like in my experience) , rich thick vanilla wood, very sweet white wine, some sugar. Taste is thick honey, second glass I tried had crazy amount of coconut as well but first one didnÂ’t or I ignored it, who knows, soy vanilla rice pudding, mead, lots of honey, brown sugar, agave, very sweet oak, insanely sweet white wine, very slick & round. Very unique beer. Slightly warming beer. Slick, almost white-wine like, rich sugar body. Expensive but a unique beer to say the least. The perfect beer for Kulminator, not surprisingly best beer that Dirk has ever had in his opinion. He basically commissioned the beer that he has been searching for his whole life.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Aroma: start looks like itÂ’s a little oxidized, oxidized but in a good way, sherry, apples and figs, sweet and a tiny bit of booze.

Taste: nice warmth of the alcohol, lovely sweetness both from the malts as from the wine, pressence of the wine is highly noticeable, pure noble rot !
flavour gets accompanied by figs, raisins, dates, golden syrup and toffee.

Booze is hidden very well, but it sure is a sipper non the less.
