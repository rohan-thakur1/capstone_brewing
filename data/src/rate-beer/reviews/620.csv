620,"2017-02-26",4.0,"(On tap @ CBC 2016 Blue Session) Pours black with a deep tan head. Rich, sweet aroma of dark chocolate, chocolate cake, dark malt and caramel, moderate roast, vanilla, light fruit and coffee overtones. Flavour is similarly rather sweet and rich but with good balancing bitterness as well. Expected strong flavours of dark chocolate and brownies, moderately roasted malts, slight fudge, cocoa powder, vanilla, coconut, bitter nuts. Light to moderate bitterness in the otherwise sweet and chocolate-heavy finish, some cacao nibs and coffee grounds. Medium-full creamy body is pretty hefty for the ABV, low carbonation. Really nice dessert stuff that isnt too cloying or overpowering but has big flavour.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

620,"2016-05-12",4.2,"750ml bottle acquired via trade with fishingnet and shared with the Mrs. Thanks a bunch, Ben. Glad to finally see this evolved from the home brew goodies. Pours a rich thick blackish hue. Opaque, dark and ominous, a dark creamy brown head atop is a firm layer, thicker film and nice ringer sticks around and laces well. Pretty, dark, luscious. Aromas are dark and chocolatey, black forest cake, coffee, creamy sweet and bittersweet cocoa nibs work well. Lots of silky dark and sweet chocolate, caramel, lactose and creamy sweetness softened the dark and twisted desserty depth as that potent coconut appeal offers a delicious and alluring strength. Coffee, dark chocolate, cakey sweetness, Devils Food, moist and rich. Initial is frankly, delicious. A rich and fuller flavor takes dark chocolate and German chocolate to a whole nother layer. Cocoa nibs, Devils food, subtle vanilla, potent cocnut, creamy sweetness beneath. Caramel, bitter bakers chocolate, coffee and some espresso, earthy, roasty appeal works in nicely as it presses on. Sufficient roast, bitterness, chocolate cut through the fuller yet silky sweet middle. Coconut presses from the get go and never really lets up, allowing the chocolate and bitter roasty appeal ebb and flow nicely. A delicious flow, palate enveloping flavor that just works. I remember drinking a version of this way back when me and Ben started trading in 2009/2010 and its everything I remember. Delicious, top echelon stronger Sweet Stout that really sets the mode.

620,"2016-03-22",4.5,"From notes. On draft at Hunahpus Day 2016 in Tampa on March 12. This one could absolutely be a possibility for most surprising beer of the day! The pour is a very dark brown with a thin cap of light tan head that slowly dissipates. The aroma is very good. This is like Im smelling a nice chocolate cake. There is chocolate, caramel, molasses, the big time chocolate addition, and a strong vanilla presence. The milk sweetness isnt there, and most of the sweet tendency comes from the chocolate. There is a hint of coconut on the back end, and its not as pronounced as I was hoping for. This is still a very good smell. The flavor is just as good. There is chocolate and roasted malt for days. The vanilla and a little molasses come in about half way through, and help the finish remain sweet. The flavor presents a hint of lactose, which I think is good for a milk stout. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly chocolatey, beautifully sweet aftertaste. This is fantastic. What a surprise!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

620,"2015-02-26",4.3,"Poured up on tap at the brewpub where it exhibits a nice deep dark body that supports a tight mocha colored head of foam. The aroma offers up inviting chocolate and then bits of vanilla, malt sweetness, dark roasted malts and a sense of coconut. The taste is smooth and getting straight into malt sweetened chocolate and then some vanilla and touch of toasted coconut.  It ends with a lingering velvety dark chocolate sensation. Wow, the light toasted coconut note goes so well here. Lovely.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
