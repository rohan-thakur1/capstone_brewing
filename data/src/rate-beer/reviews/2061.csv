2061,"2016-05-26",3.6,"Au fût @ ML Fontainas -- A rapprocher dune Oud Bruin puisquil sagit dun assemblage mixte. Bière sophistiquée de brasseur: certainement pas une bière de soif mais de dégustation pour philosopher. >> Nez profond mais fluet: senteurs vinaigrées balsamiques avec de la pâte damande, de la cassonade sans aucune amertume. La bouche fort strict livre à lattaque ses saveurs balsamiques accompagnées dune sensation acerbe qui fait penser à la prunelle sauvage. Milieu de bouche fort rond quasi liquoreux et madérisé laisse limpression de manger un sucre dorge qui colle aux dents. Larrière bouche plus complexe, offre des saveurs soutenues et profondes de barriques sur des notes acres, boisées et vineuses avec un retour des arômes balsamiques associées à une petite amertume légèrement fruitée voire florale. Manque beaucoup de moelleux. Dommage, cette prégnance du sucre et de lalcool qui oblitèrent le bel assemblage malté (je ne retrouve ni le froment ni le pecan), à mon sens trop imprégnée par le cognac. #345","Braine, BELGIUM","poech73"
