2,"2017-06-03",3.7,"(650ml 2016 bottle from Systembolaget) Pours a cloudy medium gold with a huge white head that fades to a cap with massive lace. Aroma of lemon-limeade, citrus zest, bright salty notes, lots of herbal quality, some coriander, moderate funk. On the tongue, a lot of lemon-lime character, overlaying a bright salinity, a bit of herbal dried coriander in the finish, subtle funk on the back end too. Overall, pretty tart and a little mineral, with very low bitterness. Light body, low carbonation, refreshing.

2,"2017-03-31",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
This very citrusy and dry brew leaves a mineral trail on the palate, leading to plenty of acidity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the pale yellow.
-The flavour profile is a tad linear despite the complexity of the recipe.
-Acidity levels are high, but remain pleasant.
-Salt is well integrated.
-In the end, this doesnt taste like Gose much. But you can see the lineage once you read the label and have another sip.

The flavor takes the previously mentioned flavors to combine nicely - sour to tart, slight sweet pulpy underneath. Lime/resin backbone slides into the aftertaste and on into the finish in a sour/tart sort of way.

2,"2016-01-24",2.9,"Bottle.

Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy light yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, corn starch), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of lemon zest, coriander, lavender.

Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, moderately astringent.

Not really much to talk about on this one, surprisingly. Starchy grain, citrus zest, and coriander, thats about all I can get in the nose. Quite dry in the mouth, very little residual sugar left and substantial sourness and astringency. Not bad but pretty dull.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2,"2016-01-08",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2016 22oz bottle, undated but assumedly fresh, from Fort Point Market, drunk 1/5/16. Brewed and bottled at Crazy Mountain BrewingWonderful appearance, a rich, waxen, golden-yellow body with glowing haziness and a large white head that fades slowly to cover.Oh shit. Oh my, that is certainly unexpectedly incredible. Sublime balance of floral, spice, brett, and delicate, gentle tropical fruit and citric hops. Not explosive, not quite, but what it lacks in sheer power it more than makes up for in just pure, undeniable pleasure. Just an inherently ""good"" aroma and more or less perfect. Sniffed the stuff for many, many minutes before taking a sip and really could have kept on for much longer. Nothing dominates and theres no trace of metal, dirt, blandness, alcohol, heavy citrus or any other potential problem Ive seen in various goses.The flavor almost lives up to the aroma; not quite, as at times theres just a touch of yeasty blandness that somewhat dulls the brightness. Its pretty minimal, though, and youre still left with meyer lemon, clover honey, soft, fuzzy, warm brett tones, perfectly tight carbonation and attenuation and a substantial yet dry feel to it. Acidity is never punchy or forced and builds up slowly and gently, complementing the other notes. Hops are near-perfect here, adding very little bitterness, no resin or cattiness and coming across more like nelson sauvin (which is a compliment in my book). Though amarillo and citra, when done perfectly are both incredible hops, and I daresay amarillo in peak condition might rival nelson sauvin. Anyways, this beer blew me away and I hope I can find more of it (was the last bottle on the shelf).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2,"2015-08-24",4.3,"How: Bottle (22 oz). Shared at Mont-Carmel tasting. 

>>> A spectacular wild take on a Gose, reaching some great heights of brightness and freshness. 

-  Cloudy bright yellow-ish golden with a medium white head, good retention and good lacing. 
-  Aroma is fresh and bright with amazing funk alongside surprisingly intense hops features considering its already a bit old. 
-  Taste is a bit less bright, but it leaves the place for secondary flavors like salt, coriander, lactic notes, red fruits. Its intense, but it find a way to be rather well balanced. 
-  The acidic presence is strong, but still a bit less than Westbrook Gose. It fits the beer profile really well. 
-  Light body, good carbonation and a nice salty finish cut by a bright acidity. 
-  As wild and intense as it can be, it still keep nice Gose features.

2,"2015-03-10",4.8,"Served in a Teku from bomber. Served 6mo old. Oddly, prefer this 6mo old than fresh. 

Aroma  compelling scents of sea salt and acidity emanate from the surface of this brew. I have not encountered a Gose with aromatic qualities of this nature.

Appearance  opaque golden hue glistens and gleams. Moderate frothy, white head-retention dissipates over time, but remains for minutes after pouring into Teku. Sediment congregates at bottom of glass and appears goopy white from outside of glass, but is truly a brownish-white goop when peering in from above glass. As you pour the remaining bottle into the glass, the beer is murky, pastel-like yellowish-white.

Taste  fascinating, marvelous concoction of sour, funky, salty sensations. Subtle vestiges of Westbrooks Gose coalesce brilliantly with Stillwaters ingenuity. Skeptical one could notice the alcohol in this brew prior to reading the label.

Palate  For style, there is nothing this Gose does not accomplish. Goes Gone Wild delicately explores each and every avenue of the palate and exhibits its magnificence throughout each and every sip.

Overall  This beer is in a class of its own; a truly transfixing showstopper of a Gose. Typically, I do not compare styles... Sorry, but this is one of my favorite beers of all time. Drinkability wise and quality wise, I cannot put many brews of any style past this one. Take the time to smell the roses.","The Garden of the Beer Gods, North Carolina, USA","TheGoldenChalice"

The brett is a little lost. This would be an interesting beer to age a bit. Youd lose the dank hops on the nose, but you could get some extra funk in the flavor.

Pours a hazy bright yellow with a good head and some nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is super bright with nice fruit notes of lemon, lime, & some peaches. Its got a light leathery funkiness to it and a touch of brine. 

The flavor is very tart, its got some raw rhubarb character, some lemon, and a whole bunch of peach. The saltiness is mild but noticeable, the hops are very bright and fruity, & the beer is dry with a pretty high level of sourness. 

I just really like it a lot.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2,"2014-07-09",4.2,"22 oz. bottle from Conn. Ave Wine & Liquors. Hazy gold pour, fluffy white head. Nose and flavor are ridiculous, with huge sour lemon, unripe apricot & peach, pithy bitter orange and grapefruit, lip-smacking salinity, and aggressive acidic funk. Really more of a sour than a true gose by traditional standards, but sweet Jesus is it quenching and delicious.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

The aroma and flavor have strong tart/sour citrus, grapefruit, orange peel, salt, acidic, puckering at times, but surprisingly very drinkable. This was not something I was looking for, but turned out to be very good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2,"2014-07-06",3.5,"Pours a pale almost banana yellow. Very cloudy. Medium white head. All fine foam. Little lacing but it could be the glass. Aroma is odd. I think its a mix of hops, lacto and spice, but its hard to separate things out. I like it, but the initial smell was a bit of a shock. Kinda pickley. Strong yogurt sour note with tropical fruit and citrus. Taste is quite lacto sour. Big tropical hop flavor. Some butyric acid, a tad off putting. Lots of pucker. A bit of yogurty body and otherwise light. Very interesting but I cant say that I love it.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Big tangy orange peel nose, even when cold. Salty and citric and pleasant. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Orange peel, orange pith, juicy, tangy, oily, puckery. Super intense and forward but in a very balanced way with body and carbonation that balance it perfectly. Long puckery finish. Awesome beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

2,"2014-06-30",4.9,"Numerous bottles and a few times on draft as well. Fuck yes. This beer has everything I love. Lots of funk and lots of hop aroma and pure flavor. Begins with an amazing sour and saltiness, leading to copious amount of lemony and tropical fruity hops. Flavor follows suit..lots of fruity hops and funky sharp saltiness. Shit, Ive probably had this 10-15 times now and every time it nails it. Cant say that about too many beers...even some of the whitest whales. One of the best beers I have had all year and ever.

2,"2014-06-30",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2014 Hazy gold, bright lemon with puffy large white head, nice lacing with wispy island. High acid nose compared to the westbrook, mushroom salt funk with higher acidity, sharp with a little BO. High acid front palate, salty with huge grapefruit rind and tangerine mid before lightly doughy finish, moderate citric acids burn chest in hoppy, lightly skunky finish. Very refreshing if too hot, as much a sour as a gose.

Have had 3-4 glasses of this on tap recently. UN-BELIEVABLE. Bombers dont come close. Something unseen, a 3% lactic session sour, saddle and leather so faint, ungodly high-acid lime softness throughout the whole thing, ethereal salt slakes the palate near-finish like a down pillow to the face from the girl in only her panties that youll bang for the first time T-10.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

2,"2014-06-25",4.1,"On tap at the Brick Store Pub 17th anniversary. Pours a hazy, light gold, with a big white, foamy head. The aroma is mango, grapefruit, grass, lemon juice, salt, and some light brett and lacto funk. Immediate, sharp sour flavor, with some light saltiness and a nice citrusy sweetness. While theres no perceptible hop bitterness, it seems like the hopping has balanced out the flavor quite well. Light to medium body, acidic and sharp, and a little mineraly. This is an amazingly well-made, balanced, and delicious beer. The extra hopping lights up the aroma wonderfully, and it seems to serve to balance out the harsh sourness, resulting is a sour, but balanced and very drinkable beer. I could drink a lot of this...","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
2,"2014-06-25",4.5,"Bottle. Pours cloudy yellow, aroma is hoppy. Taste is quite unique. Its kind of a hybird of a ipa with a gose. Imagine a stillwater hoppy beer finishing with a westbrook gose. This one was a treat try.","Ontario, CANADA","Ontbeertaster"

Flavor the same with such an awesome blend. Average to lighter texture. An amazing beer, with a nice improvement from the original beer with the hops blending well and adding to an already awesome Gose.  Edit: Pineapple and awesomeness.

Aroma is yeasty, citrus. Lemon, orange. A little sourness. 
Truely a fascinating appearance. Almost like hazy lemonade... but its not a shandy! Nice lacing and head retention.
Taste is sour, sweet, salty. Yeasty. A hint of hops (not getting the ""massive dose"") Sour seems to overpower a bit, but combos well with the funkiness from the brett.

Palate is pretty aggressive on the sourness. Medium body. Pretty smooth.

A very complex, yet easy drinking ale. The gose series from Westbrook has been on point. Gozu, gose, and now this one. A really great beer. Wish I knew I could get it again.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"
