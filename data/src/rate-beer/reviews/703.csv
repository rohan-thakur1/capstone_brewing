703,"2015-11-16",3.5,"on tap @ Smokehouse / Columbus OH --- Clear medium amber, ivory head cover, strips of lace. Aroma of malt. Taste is fizzy caramel malt that adds more sweet and carbonation on the swallow. It adds only a sprinkling of hops on a long finish. This depends mostly on sweet malt, but it is well enough balanced to be a keeper.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"

703,"2012-03-15",3.7,"Cask at Bodega. Just called ""Scotch Ale"" but I think this is it. Pours a hazy orange-amber with a tiny off-white head. Aroma of peat, toffee, toasted malts, earth, dust, and a surprising amount of chocolate. Flavor of chocolate, toffee, peat, grass, toast, and wood. Medium-bodied, with a sweet, sticky, an peaty mouthfeel and minimal carbonation. Cool and different.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
703,"2011-01-05",3.9,"Pint from the cask at the brewpub.  Pours medium dark brown with an off-white head.  Nose is fair amount of malt with a with maple, earth, caramel, and floral notes.  Flavor is similar with the light carbonation of a cask making this one really shine.  Very enjoyable.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
703,"2009-03-08",3.5,"On tap at the Smokehouse.  Pours clear red with a medium off-white head.  Good hop and malt balance in the nose.  Malty flavor with a nice hop finish.  Not as strong as I remember.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
703,"2008-05-16",4.0,"In short: A superior Scottish Ale.  One of the best one Ive ever had.
How: Tap at brewpub (SmokeHouse location, AleHouse #2)
The look: Clear golden body with a small off-white head.
In long: Shy nose but surprisingly tasty.  Woody malts.  Lots of sweet malts with a sweet flavour evoking a good baklava.  Well balanced with plenty of dry grassy hops.  No alcohol presence whatsoever.  Dangerously drinkable for an 8% beer.  Barleys really need to set a meeting up and have Robert Burn teach MacLenny how to brew a solid Scottish Ale.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
703,"2008-04-13",3.8,"Growler via trade with Puddintane.  Shared with bikesnandbeers, my girlfriend Cyn, his girlfriend Jessi, and her friend.  Pours copper with a tan ring.  Nose is sweet and malty.  Taste is sweet malty, with a lingering caramel taste.  Overall nice, a little light, but good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
703,"2008-03-28",3.2,"Poured a clear copper color with an off-white head.The aroma had moderate amounts of toffee, brown sugar and sweet toasted malt.  Hint of smoke and some Browned apple flavor with mild earthy notes.  Some sweet malt.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
703,"2008-03-15",3.3,"Shared, thanks to dickinsonbeer.  Clear amber pour with a thin head.  Aroma is sweet fruit / pears, and some grainy and earthy malt.  The flavor is the same as the aroma with a little toasted malt element.","San Mateo, California, USA","golubj"
703,"2008-03-15",2.9,"Shared by Dickinsonbeer, I believe via a handbottle (thanks, Paul!) - clear copper beer, with a soapy lace - smells of roasted malts and corn syrup, with very faint earthy character that was so hard to make out it may well have been my imagination - really sweet, with strong burnt sugar, roasted malts, a bit of nuttiness - some corn syrup, diacetyl, and phenolics throughout - this would not go well with my haggis at all.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
703,"2008-03-13",3.9,"Shared by Dickinsonbeer.  Amber in color with a small off white head.  Aroma: alot of toasted malts, some light fruity notes and some earth and light smoke.  Taste is malty, with toasted malts, caramel, lightly smoky, very smooth overall.  Medium bodied, easy drinking. Some light hop bitterness  in the finish.  Thanks Paul, this was good.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
703,"2008-03-07",4.0,"Growler thanks to Puddintane in the mystery 3.0 swap.  Thanks David!!!  Growler arrived with zero leakage- and it shows- carbonation is full and the head is long lived.  Pours- a nice crystal clear pretty deep coppery amber with great carb, nice head and nice lacing.  Aroma is initially nutty and fruity- light cherry skin, apricot and plum, also some sake elements along with an earthy smokiness, and some phenolic cleanser hints- but also reminds me slightly of the big fresh toasty maltiness you get from a maibock.  Great toasty and nutty flavors- light hints of smoke and earth- definitely subdued more in the flavor, while the malt backbone comes though- sweet and caramelly with toffee hints,fruts come through a bit in the flavor- this time mostly some green raisin,  lightly toasted bread, with a sharp phenolic kick which isnt all that bad, but not that great either- just wierd.  Very mild hops all the way through- with a nice smooth clean finish.  Honeslty not what I was expecting, but still pretty good overall.  Nice beer to enjoy for 2300.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
703,"2008-02-11",3.9,"On tap at the smokehouse - regular version, tasted side by side with a ""Two year barrel-conditioned"" sample from cask.  Pours deep ruby red with a tiny white head that is mostly just a rim around the edges.  Aroma is very malty, sweet, a tiny bit of smoke maybe.  Taste is sweet, extremely malty, grainy.  Tastes like having a handul of malted barley in your mouth.  No hop presence noted, mild to low bitterness.  The barrel conditioned version was significantly smoother, more complex, rounded with a little woodiness or earthiness. Less carbonation, obviously, with a creamy mouthfeel.  No sign of any spirit that I could detect, dont know what kind of barrel they used for this.  Both of these were good though Id give the nod to the barrel aged version.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
703,"2008-01-29",3.6,"On tap.   Pours a orange/amber color with a decent tan colored head.   Aroma is sweet caramel malts, light fruit, brown sugar.   Flavor is again big caramel malts, toffee, brown sugar.   Palate is medium to full bodied, medium to light carbonation, finished sticky and sweet.   One of Barleys better brews.","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"

703,"2007-05-18",3.7,"Firkin at smokehouse. Poured a medium brown color with reddish hints. Aroma was very malty, maybe a light smokiness, and some brown sugar.  After warming the maltiness really opened up on this one. Seemed a little thin and watery. Quite a tastey beer.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"
703,"2007-02-27",3.8,"On firkin @ the Smokehouse: Dark copper color with a light tan head. Aroma, roasted malts, some peaty notes, and some caramel.

703,"2006-08-16",4.0,"Cask, Brewhouse #1.  Delicious leather and raisin aroma.  Medium dark ruddy brown.  Fruity, doppl-y, waxing alcoholic, chocolate, sweet dried fruit.  Excellent.  Medium-heavy body.  Finishes sweet and woody.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
703,"2006-02-25",3.4,"Had this in a snifter at the Smokehouse.  Slightly spicy and fruity nose of cereal malts. 
The medium off white frothy head is mostly diminishing and leaves no lace.  The brew is a
sparkling copper with amber highlights.  A bold fruity and floral flavor greets the palate
with a heavy malt start, sweet alcoholic middle, and a roasted finish that hints of spice. 
The medium creamy body is lively.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
703,"2006-01-25",4.0,"Draft at smokehouse in snifter. Served at 43 degrees and let warm to 50 degrees. Dark reddish amber with an creamy off-white head that diminished slowly. Good complex sweet earthy malt and citrus aroma. Medium body. Good well balanced sweet malt and citrus flavor with a long finish with a small alcohol tone. Very good complex brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
703,"2006-01-09",4.3,"On tap at the smokehouse - Poured a magnificent ruby amber color with a nice beige head.  Aroma of sweet caramel malts, a touch of cinnamon, and some orange notes.  Flavor is full of caramel, and fruity as well.  Notes of cinnamon and orange also can be found.  Smooth as silk on the palate and the alcohol is covered beautifully.  The warmth comes through after each sip though.  A very nice beer.","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
703,"2005-03-05",3.9,"Pours a nice reddish brown with not much head. Looks like a thin barleywine. Taste is big sweet malt and hints of alcohol.  Some vineous aspects as well.  Leaves a sweet aftertaste. Well mad stuff.","USA","BennyTicklez"
703,"2003-02-23",3.6,"Okay, this was guest tap at Ale House 1. This beer was a lovely dark red amber color with a small amout of carbonation. It has a small off white head that left little lace, but no doubt to how it was poured by the bartender. An aroma of malt, caramel and a hint of the alcohol present. A flavor of malt and caramel with a warming presence of the alcohol. A slight wood taste maybe akin to astrigent was present in the finish. A good beer, but I still think I like the rare Glenlenny's Scotch Ale better.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
703,"2003-02-09",3.8,"Just had this on firkin and it was not properly fined as it came out quite cloudy. Did not affect the flavor though. Smoked peat, malt sweetness, and a subtle bitterness all balance out to mask the alcoholic strength. Pours very thick and smooth over the tongue. If they could fine this better it would be a superb beer.Earlier Rating: 1/7/2003 Total Score: 4.1Big smoky malty export. Hits the style right on the head. Deceptive in its strength, but overall a very good beer. Probably my favorite of the smokehouse.","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","tkaufman"
703,"2003-02-07",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2007 Just picked up a growler today. Dark red color, with a big beige head and pretty thick lacing. Aroma is sweet, alcohol, and somewhat fruity. Flavor of sweet malt, cinnamon, and some berry like flavors. Very smooth and drinkable","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Darkover"
703,"2003-02-01",3.4,"Dark red. No head whatsoever. I'm not a fan of peaty beer but this was well done. The peaty, malt flavor starts out mild and grows, lingering long after the beer is swallowed. Low carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Dry finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
703,"2003-01-28",4.3,"Even better than last year's batch! Higher in alcohol, but you can't tatse it at all.  This is a very smooth wonderful beer. I didn't taste grape so much this year as I did in 2002.  Beautifully brewed, it is thick, spicey and so tasty!","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","bluemeow76"
703,"2003-01-27",4.0,"Robert Burns Dinner <nbsp> 1/25/03:  on the firk at Barley’s Robert Burns Tapping.  what a breathtaking brew to admire by candlelight.  the dark red to orange gradation provided my eyes a tantalizingly sexy color to admire by flame.  further noted was a lovely ring of white head with a slight bit of lacing.  sweet hints of cinnamon orange spice and a tinge of malt granted a pleasant aroma.  full, strong malt taste with some sweetness.  8%ABV.  extraordinary. oh, and don’t forget to C.U.Y.B!","cow- lumbus, Ohio, USA","edden"
703,"2003-01-27",3.9,"Dark red/orange - almost brown.  Little head and low carbonation.  Malty, and easy to drink.  a little roasted, smoked character.  A very good Scotch ale IMO.","California, USA","stephen"
703,"2003-01-27",3.9,"Robert Burns Dinner
Poured a dark red color with a thin tan head. Beer looked really great in the candle light. Lots of lacing.
Smelled big and sweet.
Big malty flavor with a warming finish. I thought this was going to be a bigger beer with the new state laws. I guess every beer can't be 11%!
Nicely carbonated out of the cask. I liked the touch of serving yourself from the cask!
Can't wait for the bigger IPA they're brewing up soon!","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bender"
703,"2003-01-26",4.5,"Tasted at Barley's 4th Annual
Robert Burns Dinner &
Robert Burns Scottish Export Ale Tapping Jan 25th. The lower-ABV Robert Burns was one of my favorite beers when I first tried it last year. What a difference a year and 2% more ABV will make! Pours a hazy dark orange with a thin to medium light beige head. Aroma is malty and slightly smoky. Unbelievably drinkable, with a stong malt flavor and a warm alcohol presence. Three snifters of this and I was happy to be toasting the man for whom this near masterpiece was named. Amazing.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
