3326,"2017-04-19",2.8,"Pours hazy straw into a shaker. Bright white head with medium retention recedes to hug rim. Sourdough and lemon aromas. Soft with sourdough and biscuit upfront turning to rotting vegetables before the lasting earthy bitter twig finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
3326,"2017-04-19",3.6,"On draft. This proves that you can take any style of beer and make it taste more immediately impressive by adding Citra hops. Crisp and clean, like a standard lager, with a big orange juice aroma from all the Citra. Fun and refreshing.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3326,"2017-03-11",3.2,"Hazy, deep straw. 
Medium body, flavorsome, low carbonation but average heat, richer mouthfeel than most american lagers, average length. 
Crisp, dry. 
Hoppy but significant malt, resiny, citrusy. 
Pleasant, tasty and refreshing but not very original.

3326,"2017-02-11",3.1,"Keg at Switchback, Burlington.  Hazy golden, creamy head. Bready nose with some tangerine. Mid dry with light-medium body and clean mouthfeel. Spicy grainy bread, mild citrus. Mid bitter finish. Flawless, but somewhat sterile. Lacks the malt softness which is the soul of kellerbiers.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
3326,"2017-02-09",3.3,"pours unclear light but bright gold with a small creamy white cap offering some retention and lacing. golden pilsner maltiness, caramel-ish angles to my disliking, melon-driven citra, which is odd, candied grapefruit as well, very bitter herbs, light sulphur traces, clean lagering yeast. moderate carbonation, light body - thin; drying and crisp herbal-melon-citrusy finish. perhaps american pils with light citra input yet imparting unusual melonness. quenching anyhow.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
3326,"2017-01-24",3.4,"Bottle from the Lazy dog
Slightly hazy deep yellow with a firmly bubbled white head that persists. Somewhat odd meaty note up front dissipated quickly. The nose has bits of earthy spicy floral citrus and some faint bready pilsner underneath. The flavor is about what the aroma promised but add a light skunk. Not horrible but certainly not as clean as the German beer they are trying to emulate.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
3326,"2016-06-06",4.1,"Smells of sweet malts and a bit of lemon zest at the end. Slightly cloudy yellow color one of my favorites with one finger white head that slowly dissipates. Very complex flavor starting off with sweet malts then orange and lemon rind. Then followed by a nice crisp semi strong bite from the Hops. Light Sticky Buddy with zesty crisp delicate carbonation. All in all I have to say this is definitely a great light go to summer beer. Nice work.","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"
3326,"2015-10-28",4.0,"Beautiful, misty gold. Lemon oil, limestone, and hay aroma. The citrus zest of citra is woven into the fabric perfectly, as it lends its brightness without being obvious. Herbal touches can hint at soapiness. The flinty yeast coloration is intoxicating. Dry grass and apricots are prevalent in a feathery, tightrope crisp flavor. Dry wildflowers, herbs, citrus skins; same as the aroma, the ever present mineral surrounding flavor is sprightly and engaging, and intelligent. Pillowy texture with the right sparkle of carbonation, spot on. Fresh white bread flavors start to spread out as warmth and air set in, and the tangy lemon-mineral pairing can lean metallic. Truly excellent, subtle, smart stuff.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3326,"2015-09-21",3.4,"22oz bottle pours a clear gold with some soft, white head. Nose is what youd expect given the title, light grist, a little peanut skin, yeast and then bright citra hop, orange, a little tangerine. Flavor follows, a bit corny with some grist as well, yeast, peanut skin, light white grape, tangerine, some grass. Crisp finish. Decent enough.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
3326,"2015-07-29",3.4,"Light gold pour. Plenty of foam. Aroma sorta grassy. Tastes mangos. Bready.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
3326,"2015-06-16",4.5,"This is damn near close to perfection as far as pilsners go. I really like what a lot of these American craft brewers have been doing with the pilsner style and I think Switchback has possibly outdone the rest of the American craft pilsners. 

It has the ideal pils appearance, a straw yellow with plenty of carbonation. You get all the smells youd expect from a pils. that biscuity, grassy, light malt smell balanced by a fruity citrus and tart aroma. The mouthfeel is wonderfully crisp with a very nice bitter/sweet taste. Definitely one of the best pils Ive ever had.. possibly THE best","Massachusetts, USA","bavarian81"
3326,"2015-06-15",3.6,"draft in burlington. Not bad. Some light citra notes but this is dominantly a pils. The pilsner is above average with some tasty malts throughout. Crisp hop bite finish.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3326,"2015-06-14",3.5,"This was poured into a tall English pub glass with a fast pour to assist in trying to bring out a good pilsener effect.
Heres the rest.
The appearance was a nice looking hazy golden yellow color with a one to two finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving a messy lacing roaming around the glass.
The smell started off with a grassy to light citrus hoppiness roaming over a light pilsner malt.
The taste stays sweet and crisp rolling into a crisp clean grassy aftertaste leading into a refined crisp finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly good sessionability and has a nice carbonation about it. It pounds appropriately for the style and for me.
Overall, as a pilsener it definitely works adding a slight citrus in the aroma. Id have this again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
3326,"2015-06-10",3.5,"Maybe the best in the style that Ive ever had. Really excellent pils, and Im not a big fan in the style. Nice and crisp. Should make this their flagship.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
3326,"2015-06-08",3.7,"I was surprised at how much I like this beer. It is definitely an IPA lovers pilsner, as the ""liner notes"" on the back of the bottle suggest. Rich citrusy hops dominate the character of this pilsner, but the finish remains dry-- not for a German Pils, but for an IPA-- despite an abundance of lemony undertones. A very nice body and mouthfeel, and not at all too heavy or cloying like most IPAs. A fine representative of what I now call American Pilsner.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"
3326,"2015-06-04",3.4,"Pours a pale yellow with a white head. The smell is tangerines, grain. The taste is citrus, grain and grass absurd dry and fruity. Light in body with crisp carbonation.","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"
3326,"2015-06-01",3.4,"Slightly cloudy, light yellow a great dense off white head with tight bubbles. Aroma is light, hint of grapefruit, sweet orange, tangerine and table sugar. Really great mouthfeel, dense and tingly. Lager yeast is there but not overwhelming. Hop bitterness lingers for a very long time. This is a solid beer. Wish it had more juiciness.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3326,"2015-05-26",3.4,"Draft at Holy Grail, Epping. Crystal clear yellow color, fizzy carbonation that had slow dying head. The aroma is light pils malt and that faint citrus from the Citra hops. Extremely light even when warm. 
The flavor starts with very weak citrus with a massive grainy base. After the citrus dies away it ends clean with a drying finish. Body is medium leaning on light with bitterness almost nonexistent. Even fresh this is malty. Overall, pretty respectable but Im not rushing to down another pint.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3326,"2015-05-24",3.5,"From the 650 ml. bottle. The pour is yellow under a huge white head. Slight haze. The aroma is toasted, yeasty, malty, and like a flower garden. The malts present themselves the most. The body is medium to better than medium. The taste tends to focus on the malts rather than the hops. Clean, semi-dry finish.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
3326,"2015-05-12",3.7,"Tap. Pours mostly clear golden, small white head, nice lacing. Aroma is faint citra, dank and passionfruit, grain. Flavor is light sweet, light plus bitter, citrus, tropical, mango. Drinks a lot like a session IPA, but at 5%, I want a little more.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3326,"2015-05-02",3.8,"Bottle from that shithole known as Shaws. Clear gold with lasting dense white head and lace. Lemon zest aroma with hints of grassy grain and tropical fruit. Mild/medium sweetness bready and fruity for a lager with some grassy hop bitterness in the finish. Light and lively and soft. Well made but I think the natural carbonation leaves the finish lacking. It doesnt gives a little bracing bite like I like from a pilsner. Still, very good.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
3326,"2015-04-30",3.3,"Poured with medium head that quickly dissipated. Could easily smell citrus and hoppy aroma. Light yellow color. Definitely notice citrus and hops in taste but not too overpowering - would have liked to tasted a little more citrus this time of year. Light to medium carbonation with very light, crisp finish. Nice beer but wont make my short list when I go out to buy beer or when at a bar/restaurant.","Essex Jct., Vermont, USA","jnortonvt"
3326,"2015-04-18",3.6,"From 22oz bottle, about $5, poured into 16oz tulip glass

Aroma: Big citra hop aroma, citrusy, Citra, definitely loads of citra dry hopping

Appearance: straw golden, somewhere between clear and hazy, white head with good retention

Taste: Medium bitter

Palate: light body, creamy texture, average carbonation, bitter citra hop dry finish

Overall: Im big fan of pils with Saaz hops, but the citra hops nearly overpowers any spicy/Saaz flavoring for me. Loads of Citra hops with a very prominent citrus aroma and taste. Light bodied and well lagered for a clean, mostly clear Pilsner. Saaz, spicy hops is very subtle on the flavor, but if you look really hard you can find them. Somewhat lemony. Very easy to drink. Good beer, but Id love to taste one without the citra hops.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","jamesewelch"
