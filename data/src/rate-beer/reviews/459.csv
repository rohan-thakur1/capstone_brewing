459,"2016-07-22",4.2,"This was an introductory stout for me, several years ago when I first started enjoying beers. At first, it was something similar to my normal go to at the time. Now, it¬ís a classic that I will always remember as one of the beers that really got me into the craft. It¬ís cool to see such an old school stout that has remained the same for so long, and see it stand up to all the great stouts that come and go whole it lives on. I don¬ít know how I never rated this before, but I¬ím glad I didnt. I feel like I¬ím ready to give it the proper recognition it deserves. Nitro pour at the Collective. Cola black pour with an infinite tan cream cap. Toasty malt aroma provides the invitation. Flavor is a roasted malt, sweetened by a rich milk chocolate and subtle dryness. Oat like sweetness, as expected. Model beer to be presented on nitro. I still think they rule the chocolate in beer world. I can¬ít quite call this up to the Double Chocolate curve, but this beer is a solid stout that will always be there for you. This stout is timeless.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

459,"2015-08-17",3.4,"{from notes} 
Appearance: Dark brown/black pour, with a modest light brown head that all too quickly reduced to a thin and spotty cover. 

Smell: Medium + dark roasted malts overlaid with some spicy hops. Some oats, coffee and chocolate too. 

Taste: It seems that the brewer replaced some grains (oats and/or dark malts) with hops; this is clearly an AMERICAN stout. It has a moderately bitter finish, with a relatively bitter and near-burnt aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body with mild carbonation. Has an unusual (for style) light crispness.

Overall: A decent oatmeal stout, but disappointing for a stout made by Rogue. Certainly served too cold and deserving of a re-tasting. I know you feel my pain. ;)","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

Pretty light. The bitter comes on early. Taste is more IPA than oatmeal, which is what I prefer to avoid in a stout. However, the Oatmeal starts to shine more after the first glass.

459,"2014-06-19",4.3,"Transfer from BA review from 6-10-12- 
Served on nitro-tap in a tulip shaped glass

Appearance ¬ñ Served a nearly pitch black color with a wonderful thick light brown nitrogen formed head. The head was very persistent and lasted the entire drinking experience.

Smell ¬ñ The aroma was of roasted malt and cocoa with a sugary sweetness. The sweet aromas were hard to plac,e but seemed to be mainly of molasses and brown sugar . Mixed with these was a light burnt smell that overall created a nice balance to the sweet aromas of the sugar.

Taste ¬ñ The taste started out of roasted malt and a lighter oat flavor. The cocoa that was detected in the nose quickly came to the tongue. It started out sweet when it arrived due to a nice molasses sweetness the accompanied its arrival, but the molasses started to fade more toward the middle of the taste as some roasted coffee flavors began to develop. These bittered the brew a bit and left a nice, more dry, roasted and cocoa flavor on the tongue.

Mouthfeel ¬ñ The creamy nitrogen driven body coated the mouth, bathing it in all the wonderful flavors of the brew. Being a nitro the effervescence was lighter, this accentuating all those wonderfully slightly sweet dark and roasty flavors.

Overall ¬ñ This was one fine tasty beer. The nitro pour suited all the darker roasted flavors very well giving an overall creamy and satisfying brew.","","Darkmagus82"

459,"2014-01-21",2.2,"Maybe it¬ís just because I just recently had a Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout, but I can care less about what awards this beer has won: it lacks everything a good oatmeal stout should have. I remember my first oatmeal stout: an Ipswich back in 1995; now, that was good. And full disclosure: I¬ím a big Rogue fan. I have a big box from Rogue ready to be opened in my dining room. (Dead Guy - XS Dead Guy especially - both are great beers.) But this beer: the inappropriate hops, the uncreamy bitterness, the overall blandness: this just isn¬ít what you want in an oatmeal stout. 

In an extremely rare act, I have dumped out my glass. I did this because, beckoning me from my fridge, was a beautiful bottle of Speedway Stout. I wanted to (a) clear my palate, and (b) reaffirm my belief in the Stout. I poured a glass... and belief is restored.

459,"2014-01-17",4.1,"650 ml bottle bought at YATA in Grand Century Place, Mong Kok.
Looks: Clear, deep Cola blackish brown colour with lots of chocolate-like yeast sediments. 

Pours: without yeast, it¬ís half finger head and dark beige foam which last for 30 seconds (the final yeast pour comes with an explosive 3-finger head which lasted for 3 minutes). Very good sticky lacing and small bubbly carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and nicely sweet roasted malt, with light black coffee, rich chocolate, nice vanilla, cream, dark fruits, sugar, caramel and light grass.

Body: Mid to light, with pretty slick and creamy palate.

Taste: close to medium sweet dark roast malt, with distinctive sour notes, then comes with a quick fire combination of strong nuts, fresh, black coffee, rich dark chocolate, burnt toffee, and sharp grassy hops. Then all of a sudden they are wrapped up into a lightning fast very sharp and bitter blitz of sharp liquorice comes with very herbal and salty after taste. Crazy!

Mouth Feel: Initially it feels like a decent, if unspectacular chocolate stout, the sudden bitter attack by roasted oat and hops took me by surprise: nicely bitter and highly astringent, it dominate 2nd half of the taste, overbearing yet likeable. Sourness is sharp and nice throughout. Coffee, chocolate and burnt taste are all there albeit ended abruptly. Some brew!

Hoppiness: light grass nose, sharp liquorices and very herbal grass in taste. Strong bitterness, astringency and saltiness to finish the rollercoaster experience.

After Taste: Fairly dry, smooth, tart and bitter to mouth.	

Comments: This one is full-on roasted oat attack, with its smooth mouth feel and out of this world bitterness almost stole the whole show, but its own nice maltyness and chocolate stout taste still stand up well to the challenge.

459,"2013-07-26",3.8,"It¬ís strange now to see that a beer doesn¬ít list its alcohol by volume on its bottle now, but what¬ís stranger: not only for a stout not to list its alcohol by volume, but the fact that it does list its bitterness units. Stouts almost never list their bitterness... and for this to only list its bitterness and not its alcohol content. Just... strange. Fortunately, nothing else about this beer is strange.


The head on Rogue Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout
The beer is solid black in color with a full, frothy, medium-brown head that rests a centimeter above the edge of the glass. Waves of lacing are left straight down the edge the glass. The aroma is sweet and malty, with only a hint of roasted malts and chocolate. It¬ís very smooth and very easy on the nose. It¬ís super silky in the mouth, full-bodied, with a delicious, sweet hop and malt aroma making its way through the nose as the beer enters the mouth. A sharpness surfaces through the softness of the body, ending in a slightly bitter flavor - and you can¬ít really tell if it¬ís bitterness from the hops or from the roasted grains. I¬ím guessing it¬ís a little of both. 

It¬ís incredibly well-balanced in the middle, with flavor mellow enough to let the smoothness shine unobstructed, but sharp enough for its hay-like, rustic oat deliciousness surface. Well done. Most stouts are either too roasted or too overdone on chocolate. This focuses on neither, and allows you to really enjoy a palatable, yet still rich, stout.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Poured from 22 oz. bottle into snifter glass.

A: Pours a dark black with a one finger dark khaki/caramel head. Light cannot pass through this wonderfully looking stout. Great lacing.

S: Instant chocolate hits your nose for a brief second followed by a slightly bitter coffee. The hops come through to enhance the bitterness and tone down the sweetness of the chocolate

T: Bitter coffee upfront with a sweet oat taste through the middle followed by an even sweeter chocolate that hits the back end and stays on the pallet. 

M: For a stout it is light but slightly chewy at the beginning. Smooth finish. Goes down VERY easy

O: Great Stout that paired very well with the meat I was having at the time. Take the time to enjoy a few sips before the meal though as this changes the taste slightly and is less bitter up front during the meal.

Aroma: The nose is roasted malts, coffee, un-sweet chocolate, and a little smoke

Appearance: It pours a dark brown color with a small medium brown head

Overall Impression: 
I¬íve had this beer before, as it has been a staple for quite sometime, but it has been a while since I had one.

But the pour was great! Deep, rick, thick black. Opaque. 
The head is a full finger thick, and is indeed thick. Dark, dark brown and rich. Slow to dissipate, but does dissipate completely. 

I started it cold. It tasted both sweet and bitter at the same time. At first all I could get was a slight coffee taste. Hoppy. And, a little flat aftertaste like the end of a Bud. That part wasn¬ít pleasant. But I don¬ít know if it was because I got used to it, or getting warmer improved it, but that flat, bitter, sour aftertaste didn¬ít last through the first glass, and not at all in the last two glasses.

459,"2012-08-25",3.3,"22 oz. bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass.

A: Pours a borderline pitch black color. The head is a huge four finger light mocha color with frustratingly high retention, a wonderfully creamy texture, and huge clumps of lacing on the glass.

S: Light oats, mild chocolate, and some solid roastiness. Nice, but a little weaker than I like.

T: At first, it¬ís vaguely sweet, likely from the oats. There¬ís little opening flavor here, it¬ís mostly concentrated after the midtaste and finish, which is not only strong with roast (slightly acrid and excessively strong at times), it also tastes overhopped, to an extent. It¬ís not a well melded hop profile as with Storm King, it¬ís a ¬íclashing with the stout base¬í profile. At least the hops don¬ít completely overpower the palate with grapefruit and pine; still, it¬ís hardly a paragon of balance. Finally, enough sips will cause a slight lactic acid ¬ítwang¬í to accumulate. I expected a lot more from this, but it¬ís decent enough.

M: Creamy at first, before becoming prickly dry with a little lingering stickiness and low carbonation. Little to complain about here, Rogue got this part of the beer right. On the other hand, it¬ís not as drinkable as it should be, but that¬ís due to the unbalanced flavor profile more than anything.

O: I¬ím wondering if I served this too warm - but then I realized I had Samuel Smith¬ís oatmeal stout at a similar temperature, and was far superior to this in just about every manner. I¬íd definitely try it again, just to confirm whether or not my fears are true. All in all, it¬ís far from bad, just disappointing.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Body is medium thick, but smooth, with creamy carbonation, and a fairly light flavor profile, light sweetness, giving it the illusion of medium-light; certainly not fatiguing to drink.  Flavor has a burnt wood, almost smoky character, herbal, sappy hops, a little burnt dark cocoa, some tantalizing floral hop character that affects the sides of the palate.  Roast is neutral; no coffee. It¬ís good, but needs more flavor to deserve the score it has.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"

459,"2012-03-01",3.3,"From notes.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

This pours nearly black, with nearly no other color highlights -- just a hint of ruby in the very corners of the glass. A nice creamy brown head forms, then fades to a ring with some thin film on toop. The head reaffirms itself with every swirl of the glass. Some foamy lace.

The aroma is mostly roasted malt without much sweetness attached, some chocolate malt, chocolate, brewed coffee, and a bit of earthy hops as well.

The flavor starts with a huge dose of unsweetened roasted malt character. Some unsweetened chocolate and chocolate malt step in, with a rising touch of bitter coffee, and earthy hops to finish. The combination of coffee malts and a strong hop presence just give me too much bitterness here, and I am a hophead.

Poured an almost opaque, dark reddish-brown, almost black color with creamy tan foam which faded to a persistent layer of bubbles and lace. Aromas of roasted barley, husky cereal grains, fruity ale yeast esters, more zesty American hops than typical stouts. Rich malty and roasty flavors, bready, caramelly, somehow simultaneously tart and smooth, surprisingly dry, notes of burnt toast, coffee, chocolate, plums. Creamy, chewy, protein-y oatmeal mouthfeel, moderate-high carbonation, lingering bittersweet aftertaste which finished bone dry.

This was already one of my favorite beers via the bomber. Then I tried this on tap and, WOW, it was only ridiculously better. The big downfalls from the bottle version (effervescence and somewhat thin body) were improved upon and what was already good was only better.

A: Nice, creamy dark brown body with a nice, brown head.

S: A rich, semi-sweet, and somewhat bitter aroma.

T: A beautiful combination of chocolate, sweet oatiness/maltiness, roasted malts, and bitter coffeeness

The pour was a dark black with a decent head for a stout, tan as expected, that stuck around for a bit before dissolving to a film, and once settled, I found the appearance to be a pitch black, even when tilting toward the light, this sucker didn¬ít give on the edges, still pitch black. 

The palate was a heavy, thick body with a creamy texture that sat on the tongue with a pleasing frothiness. It gave me a little tingle as it finished. The taste was a med-heavy malty cereal at first that faded to a light bitter on the tongue with a medium bitter creeping up the nasal passage, a tasty bitter coffee/oaty aftertaste.

Ar- The expected aroma of cocoa / chocolate rise out from a cloud of darkly roasted, toasted and even chared malt. I think I am getting vaguely smoke tones and leathery notes. 

Ap- The beer is black no opaqueness to light. The head was a short lived nugget coloration. Rings of foam mark the beers passage from my glass. 

T- The expected toasted and roasted notes are in place. I am a bit annoyed at the level of over roasted and frankly burnt malts present. It reminds me of Starbucks coffee. I hate Starbucks sugary burnt coffee. Bittersweet chocolate brings a welcome break from the burnt notes.

459,"2011-02-25",3.7,"The beer has got a very dark, opaque brown body, with a rich brown head. Wonderful lacing and impressive head retention. A truly beautiful stout!

A pronounced earthy hoppiness really fights for the main role in the aroma. However, the strong roasted malt profile is still the dominant. Dark chocolate and coffee, with some toasted bread notes.

The taste is kind of coarse at first, with a very pronounced bitterness and coffee notes. However, after a few moments, it becomes much smooth and a bit more complex. It has a very rich roasted malt profile, with almost tobacco-like notes. Dark chocolate, espresso, a bit of licorice, and oatmeal. The finish is bitter and malty. As the beer warms up, you may get some nice sweetness and a smoother finish. Tasty, yet very roasty, so not necessarily a beer for all.

Medium-bodied. Some carbonation can be felt at first. No real feel of alcohol. Not the most pleasant mouthfeel, yet it is quite alright.

S: Plenty of coffee and chocolate alongside some roasted malt characteristics and a little bit of earthy bitterness.

459,"2010-04-03",4.2,"5.99USD from strip liquor in Las Vegas (north of Wynns/Encore casino). 22oz Bomber. 6%ABV. This unfortunately was not savoured in a glass (strip walk beverage) and subsequently not enjoyed to it¬ís full potential. From the small opening i was able to admire the aromas to a lesser extent; some citrus from the cascade, however mostly chocolate and roasted malts. As my experience continued with this beer, the head remained an inch thick until the lesser part of the bottle, carbonation was medium-low. Medium mouthfeel showcasing chocolate, roasted and sweet malt flavours with cascade hop flavour quite predominant in the initial stages. The oats present allow a very smooth creamy finish, ensuring your willingness for the next taste. Not all that complex, but that¬ís a job for the Russian Imperials. This is an excellent beer which i look forward to savouring again.. this time in a glass.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","imaragingbull"
459,"2010-04-03",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2012 One of the ways I measure my enjoyment of a beer is by how much I would like to drink more of it. In the case of Rogue Shakespeare Stout, simply drinking a 22oz bomber was not NEARLY enough. This is exactly what I look for in a beer: a strong flavor that caters to the discriminating beer drinker while also being easy to drink and surprisingly light in weight. I know lightweights won¬ít like it, which in turn makes me enjoy it even more.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAThe beer poured a little rough and formed a nearly pitch-black opaque body with a thick, creamy head which lasted for quite a while and left quite a lot of lacing on the glass. It scent was odd for a stout with a deep roasted quality detectable in the nose as well as a significant hoppy component. So many stouts tend to be weak and flat in scent, but Shakespeare Stout is quite vocal.TASTEThere¬ís only one word that comes to mind when it comes to describing the taste of this beer: roasty. I often associate stouts with having a dry, bitter flavor with some roasty quality. But in the case of Shakespeare Stout the opposite seems to be true. This is a beer whose roasty flavor is quite pronounced, balanced with a creamy core which mixes coffee and chocolate flavors to give it a subtle, smooth, sweet finish. Its rare I come across this beer that is so intense in taste and still makes proper usage of its hoppy side. Usually, I associate an India Pale Ale with the high IBU rating of 69 this beer has, That a stout can be this bitter and this tasty without coming off as bland and dry is quite an accomplishment.FINISHFor a highly-hopped beer, Shakespeare Stout is surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. It does have a noticeable creaminess to its taste, which probably accounts for its smooth finish.BODYStouts are often thought of as being ¬ìheavy¬î beers which is not necessarily true (Guinness has only 15 more calories than Bud Light). At 6% ABV, Shakespeare Stout is only slightly more potent than your average beer. I¬ím not sure how many calories it has, but for such a dark beer it is surprisingly light on your system. That¬ís another sign of quality, though ¬ñ not overwhelming the drinker.FINAL THOUGHTSRogue Shakespeare Stout is what I would consider a beer for serious drinkers only. The flavor is quite complex and intense that it¬ís better for sipping, not chugging. I drank mine as slowly as possibly trying to savor the craftsmanship that was put into making this such a great beer.NOTE: watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF2S1pk_YAQ","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

It¬ís fresh, warmer smelling than any beer I¬íve tried - humid actually, has a dark roasted nuttiness, flavoured malts and slightly dusty. You can notice the faintest hint of alcohol...but I¬íve been smelling this for 15+ minuites...it just keep changing. But none of this comes even close to being overpowering at all. A perfect pour produced a HUGE dark tan head that occupied 1/3 of my glass. Now that I¬ím done the aroma part of the review it¬ís finally gone. Very very dark, but still has a noticable reddish hue. The intensity of the differnet flavours waver throughout the tasting, but once again never overpower the beer. More sweet than bitter chocolate goodness, soft roasted malts and a slight candy?? not sure there...I¬íll have to add more on the next bottle cause by time I got this far, I¬íve only got about 2 sips left - too busy enjoying it. Mouthfeel is freaking awsome. Man, can I feel the bitterness of the chocolate and the roasted flavour on my tongue. Good bitterness and a slight sweet bitter aftertaste. Very smooth.

Comparing this A:B with Stone RIS is a good illustration of contrast between a regular and Impy modern USA Stout, with the Stone showing a greater density and liqueur-like presentation, and near double the alcohol.Shakespeare at 6% is not all that light in the body, however - I find it one of Rogue¬ís finer brews. Sticky dark coffee pour with brown highlights and good size espresso crema head. I find the crisp hop bite refreshing in contrast to the roasty sweet malt. Beautiful lingering treacly cocoa aromas.

459,"2008-10-17",4.3,"A long anticipated brew, and rightfully so.  As soon as the beer is poured, it‚Äôs poetic beauty is captured in the pitch black, opaque ebony body and thick, frothy, root-beer-float head, which itself is the color of a rich chocolate shake.  As the head dissipates, it leaves thick brown lacing on the glass and maintains a small pleasant ring atop the body.  (I have found that even the darkest stouts still have a ruby hue when held to the light.  This one does not.  It is black as night, and as unforgiving as a black hole...)  Roasted malt, rich chocolate and marshmallows drift languidly from the glass, followed quickly by aromas of flaky, grainy rolled oats, brown sugar and maple, and sticky sweet raspberry liqueur(Chambord).  The taste is lusciously bittersweet, with baking cocoa, espresso, vanilla bean, and toffee-like, caramel-malt.  There is a particular earthy quality, likely from the oats, and again, dark fruits and ripe black raspberries.  The sensuous dark liquid rolls like silk across the tongue, and caresses the throat with a smooth, oily, velvet-like body.  A terrific mouthfeel, soft and sweet, make this beer very easy to enjoy, and it‚Äôs modest alcohol content allows for more of the rich, sweet chocolatey flavor to come through before the gentle, drying hop finish.  Excellent pairing with rich desserts.  (In my case, a homemade batch of oreo/brownie pizza with marshmallows and walnuts.)  Delicioso!","Independence, Kentucky, USA","shalloWMeans"

Taste blew the irish imbiber out of the water literially. taste is of chocolate, coffee, and malty goodness. i get a hint of maltballs when drinking this beer. i have had it in the bottled form and prefer it that way.

ABV: 6%
IBU: 69
Volume: 1 pt. 6 fl. oz.
Glass: tapered pint 12 oz.
Purchased at: circle
Consumed on: 2.5.2007

first impression: Rich deep dark chocolate color with an inch thick head. A true stout. Depth is impenetrable. A darkness in flavor too, though not rough or rocky - very smooth and quite appealing. Dull and has feel of clay slip. Definite chocolate undertones, with hints of licorice and allspice. It¬ís delectable.

Visuals -- Color, depth, Belgian lace, legs: The color is absolutely thick with a deep brown. Only at the very edges does any caramel color emerge. It¬ís mysterious. Head is thick even after retreating. It is a solid stout, and fairly still, like a moat. Lace is intricate and leggy. Crystalline structures are well supported and the lace sparkles.

Olfactory -- Aroma: Aroma is like a sealed box of fudge. You can¬ít keep the flavor from scenting the air.

Taste -- Hoppiness, bite, maltiness, flavor: The taste is full, deep, and entirely satisfying. It reminds of a chocolate whole wheat bread.

Tactile -- weight, mouthfeel: This is a warming, hearth of a beer. It¬ís quite dense to look at and to lift and is absolutely full of heft.

second impression: This is the first stout I¬íve ever actually enjoyed, as others seem watery, or too heavy, or without character and I fear others will pale comparatively. This is an absolutely fantastic beer.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

459,"2008-05-07",4.2,"Aroma: Smells predominantly of sweet roasted and burnt malts, like baking chocolate and a bit of coffee. There¬ís also a subdued but sharp, kind of fruity and tart hop characer as well.

Appearance: A rich coffee black. Completely opaque, except along the extreme edges, which shine with a bright cherry-red glow. The head is creamy, dense, and raspberry latte-colored with thick lacing all the way down.

Flavor: Tastes like an imperial stout! No-holds-barred burnt dark chocolate and coffee grounds are the main flavors, plus a flowery bitterness provided by the cascade hops. There¬ís also a hint of dark rum, which complicates the flavor beautifully. I think this would go well with any dessert en flamb√©: bananas foster, cherries jubilee... cr√©me brul√©e would be good, too. Nice dry finish.

Palate: Sticky, medium-bodied with creamy bubbles. It is a bit watery-feeling and kind of sloshes around your mouth, but it¬ís good overall.

Overall: This beer is slightly syrupy and kind of dense, but also quite delicious! Highly drinkable. I would definitely recommend this beer, and it was pretty cheap, too.","Kitakyushu-shi, JAPAN","soulgrowl"

459,"2008-05-02",4.0,"On tap.  Pours an opaque black with dark mahogany hints around the edges.  Served with a dense one-finger tan head that showed very good retention and lacing.  This one looked quite nice.  Smell is dominated by sweet roasted chocolate malts with strong coffee aromas.  There was also a noticeable hop aroma in the background.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by the strong bitter hop presence up front in this one which quickly gave way to the big malty chocolate and coffee taste.  Hint of dark fruits gave way to the slightly bitter hop finish.  Mouthfeel is really nice on this - very creamy for such a medium bodied stout and a small amount of carbonation.  This was an excellent stout for me and it surpassed my expectations honestly.  I don¬ít know if I could drink more than one in an evening, but that one was damn good.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Succulent juicy hop aroma (sprinkled with ash) I now recognise as CASCADE. And lots of it. Blindfolded, would swear this was not a stout, but a Warwickshire/American Pale Ale from up the road at Tunnel. Slight body, but it suits. Merciless prickling dry stout lingering with cigar smokiness, charred malt and chocolate. Bitter, bitter high cocoa chocolate shot through with lemon oil and citrussy hop tang. Forceful but not overpowering, and a lip-smacking savoury balance of flavours. When I spilt some on the carpet, I nearly cried.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

Can¬ít ask for a better appearance than this. Great aroma of chocolate-covered coffee beans with a clear hoppiness in the background. The citrus is unconventional (well unless you¬íre on the west coast where no amount of hops is too much) and interesting, but it may be a little strong. Flavor is an epic coffee-forward barrage of roastiness with less hops than the aroma would lead you to believe. This ends up being pretty perfect as far as balance goes. Really tasty stout.

Respectable head that resembles cocoa. Smell of malt and coffee dominates with some milder chocolate undertones. Sharp pleasing taste on initial. Roasted malts for sure. Coffee definately and a slight chocolate. Smooth but fierce. Head disappears but clings to the glass. Hop profile evident but extremely well balanced.

There is an ample, mottled, chocolate brown head that leaves behind some beautiful tan lacing.  The aroma is fantastic!  Various chocolates, from dark to light, strike the nose immediately.  Roasted coffee beans follow closely behind, with a faint bit of smoke and a striking herbal hoppiness.  The hops really lend a freshness to the aroma that is quite appealing.  The flavor is comprised of chocolate, fresh roasted coffee, subtle anise notes, and again that fresh herbal hop flavor that really sets this one apart.  The body is just on the full side of medium.  The finish is smooth, with a great coffee aftertaste.  I love how Rogue is able to infuse these beautiful herbal hop flavors into their dark beers!

Smells like coffee and alcohol. Tan head recedes quickly. First tastes are dark chocolate with something akin to molasses. Roasty and toasty but feels a bit watery. I feel I was a bit harsh before. I think it was originally rated next to a Great Divide Yeti (which was awesome).

The Happy Gnome called it ""Rogue Nitro Stout,"" but described it as the nitro version of Shakespeare Stout. I see no ""Rogue Nitro Stout"" listed on RateBeer, so I¬íll enter it under Shakespeare Stout. Weak aroma of sweet chocolate with a hint of coffee. Pours a dark brown with a large amount of light beige/tan head. Looks very good, as one would expect from a nitro. The initial dominant flavor is coffee, but a carmel, malty sweetness increases with each sip. Nice, roasted coffee finish and aftertaste. Light to medium body.

Burned charcoaled meat flavor that sticks to the back of your throat. You know, like when your grilling and drinking at the same time and you forget you got meat on the grill?  Cold strong black coffee.  Low carbonation. Quite bitter and offensive to an extent. Finish is dark, bitter and lasting. This probably should be categorized as an imperial stout.

Poured jet black into an imperial pint glass. If I look hard enough and hold it to the light I can faintly see a mahogany shimmer. The head is amazing after the pour. Two fingers of billowy milk chocolatey goodness that makes itself very comfortable but eventually fades to a cap. Thin micro bubbled lacing after each sip. 

Smells mainly of roasted malts. There¬ís some cocoa powder in there as well along with the smallest amount of burnt malts. I can pick up a little cascade hoppiness at first but it fades to the malts rather quickly. As this beer warms I even pick up sweet tobacco. Smells like a perfect beer to drink on this cold evening.

Tastes begins with mellow bitter coffee beans and intensifies by mid-palate. On the swallow the coffee beans turn themselves in to a creamy cappucino with a touch of milk chocolate in the aftertaste that makes a nice accompaniment. The more I drink the more the bitterness lingers in the finish. Very nicely done.

Mouthfeel is good. I would like it better if it was a little more creamy in the mouth but it¬ís still good. theres some carbonation that makes this beer feel lively and keeps it moving like it should. Finishes moderately dry and clean.

For a stout the drinkability is pretty high. Being cold like it is right now I could easily drink a couple of these bombers. If it was a warm day I don¬ít think it would be as easy to put down.

This is a really clean well made stout. I am constantly finding myself impressed with each new Rogue I pick up.","Illinois, USA","joe1510"

Nice rich flavor aside from the roasted malts there is a strong coffee presence along with some chocolate and toffee flavors. A mild smokiness comes about which is unexpected and well received.

459,"2007-03-23",3.9,"Still trying to classify this one in my mind.  Dry or Sweet?  I guess the crystal malt makes it more of a dry stout.   I agree, not as good as the chocolate stout, but then I am biased towards sweet stouts.  Has a rich plum, roasted malt and chocolate aroma.  Has an oily, somewhat acidic, grainy palate, with a toasted finish. Oh yeah and it looks great too, I can¬ít fault the looks, really black with a thick creamy looking tan head.   Decent product.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"

Flavour very, very nice - opens with a surprising fruitiness from the hops, then immediately switches gears into a robust, dark roasted malt mouth filler.  All this segues into a long bitter hop/dry dark cocoa finish.  Excellent stuff, and much more full-flavoured than many things that call themselves stouts.

459,"2006-12-31",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2011 Awesome pour; black with only faint hints of red when up to the light; head is full, creamy, pillowy, and a dark color.  The tight head lasts a significant while and leaves excellent lacing.  Simple but very pleasant nose; bittersweet dark chocolate, roasted grains, light coffee with significant hops aromas of earth and light floral.  Flavor is not nearly as appealing, burnt toast and light chalk are dominant with some dark chocolate, roast, maybe some oats.  Bitterness is moderate with earthy, almost cedar-like, hops and a good amount of acidity is also noted.  Palate is medium with a moderate carbonation, and a velvety feel.  Finishes dry with earthy cedar and bittersweet chocolate, kind of short.  Despite the fact that I didn¬ít really like the flavor, the rest of the beer is put together very well.  I have not tried this in a few years and my feelings are the same.  The chalkiness is a bit overwhelming but the cascade notes seem more prominent, which is nice but a bit clashing with the style.  And I feel like the oats do not add creaminess to the palate.  A bit overrated in my book.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

The beer make it¬ís dark chocolate tastes known right away, along with some mildly acidic black coffee notes.  Finishes with a real dark effervescense: chocolate again, but there¬ís a licorice taste merging with the tangy cascade hop flavor.  Lingering bitterness is pretty complex, and still makes me recal the dirt in the aroma.  I think the beer is SLIGHTLY on the thin side, but it¬ís plenty creamy and fills the mouth well enough still.  Carbonation starts too high, but can be easily let out with enough glass swirling.  For some I reason, I¬ím always catching some dirt and earth in Rogue beers, which is something I enjoy.

459,"2006-09-07",3.3,"bomber.  Aroma:  heavy roasted malt with notes of bittersweet chocolate and coffee, oats, bread dough, and some pine and floral hops.  Appearance:  Black with slight garnet highlights.  Head was dark tan, big, and rocky.  Nice lacing.  Flavor:  Again roasted malt comes up first with some bitter coffee and slight chocolate flavor.  A touch of peanut skins and vanilla, as well.  Some piney hop flavor comes in right before it finishes.  Bitterness is a little higher than I like for the style. Also getting a bit of a metallic flavor.  Palate:  Medium bodied.  Medium-high carbonation.  Some roasted malt astringency noted.  Overall:  This is a decent stout, but a little overhopped for me.  Bitterness also a little higher than I like.  Not bad, but not my favorite.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","RagallachMC"
459,"2006-09-03",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2006 22 OZ bottle obtained locally. Pours midnight black with a massively chunky tan head. Head last for a long while. Nice aroma. I can detect oats, vanilla, toffee, mocha. Very sweet mocha flavor up front, then some vanilla kicks in followed by the roasted malt flavors in the somewhat sour creamy bitter finish. Medium bodied. Also the hops come out on top in the end, especially the aftertaste. Actually get some of the grapefruity cascade hops in the finish and aftertaste. Tone down the cascade hops or use a different hop and this would be better. Still good though, just not great. This is MUCH better at near-room temp, or 65 degrees as opposed to 45-50...the warmer temp seems to allow the malts to somewhat keep the cascade hops in check. This beer gets a 3.4 at 45 degrees and a 4 at 65 so will split the diff and call it a 3.6 as i am not normally ging to wait 30 minutes to drink once it comes out of the fridge.","Oregon, USA","kenb"

The look: Black body topped by a small tan head
In long: Medium roastiness.  Light coffee notes.  Light black chocolate notes.  Light dark fruits notes.  Light-medium sweetness.  Light-medium hops bite.  In a way this an American stout with no personality but on the other hand this is a very well brewed most exemplary American stout.  Just a little bit of everything.

On the pour, this looks like Goose Island Bourbon County, which bodes well: red-brown fizzy foam producing thin but sticky and grainy brown lacing over a deep black beer.  Smells better than the GI Bourbon County: roast, fresh buttered bread, chocolate malt, and even some fruity bourbon (how does it do that without being aged in a barrel?).  That¬ís where the comparisons stop, however.  This is thin for a stout, like Left Hand Imperial (non-oaked version) only more watery.  The flavors are well articulated: roasty and subtly hoppy on the front, dry and medium bitter on the finish, which is long.  Chocolate is an undercurrent more than a signature feature all the way though.  As mentioned, this reminds me of Left Hand Imperial, but a roastier and drier version (both of which I like).","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

I had this one early on, and liked it, so I figured I should try it again.  Turns out, I actually under rated this beer!  This beer still looks great, and smells great.  Now I detect more in the aroma (in addition to before).  Creamy roast and sweet chocolate malt are definitely apparent here now.  The palate is still fantastic, and I don¬ít really taste the grit now.  I have to say, I am tempted to boost this score most in the flavor department.  There¬ís such nice smooth roastiness in this brew, particularly well balanced against the lactic chocolate sweetness.  The hops even come out and stand out nicely within the roasty finish.

459,"2006-01-24",4.8,"Rogue Shakespeare Stout, is a big, hoppy, malty stout brewed by the Rogue Brewery of Newport, OR. This beer is an oatmeal stout by style, and is an excellent example. It is quite hoppy as well, and because of this, some beer geeks in the PNW have dubbed this beer, PNW Stout. This really isn¬ít a sub style of stout, and Rogue would fall into the oatmeal stout category.

Rogue has a marketing practice that I really don¬ít agree with. Rogue Shakespeare Stout is also know as Wild Irish Rogue, their St. Patrick¬ís Day tribute. That is right, Shakespeare and Wild Irish Rogue, are the same beer. So, buyer beware if you purchase a Shakespeare, and a Wild Irish sitting on the same shelf, you just bought the same beer. Rogue does this with  other beers as well, and marketed the same beer under a few different labels. 

Call this beer Shakespeare or Wild Irish, it is excellent. Since I¬ím of Irish/German heritage, I¬íll go with Wild Irish. Wild Irish pours to a deep black color, with a nice tan head, and good carbonation. The nose is very fragrant with hop aromatics. Its that classic, citric, piney hop aromas that are so inviting. There is a good bit of chocolate malt aroma in the nose as well. The palate is delicious, very firm dark malt backbone. Flavors of chocolate, a touch of roast, and coffee. The body is muscular, with a very slick and silky mouth feel. Oatmeal makes a beer very smooth and creamy tasting. This beer finishes with some nice roast bitterness, then really EXPLODES into a long, dry, citric hop bitter bite. Fresh this beer is amazingly good. Another caveat concerning Rogue beers. They are not pasteurized, and DO NOT travel well. I have had some horrible Rogue beers because they have been old and stale, Rogue beers are very fragile. So think twice if a bottle appears to be old, and don¬ít be afraid to ask if there is any fresh Rogue available. Match this beer with hearty dishes such as beef or lamb stew. It would also go well with a desert such as chocolate cake, or Boston cream pie.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

A little weak on the aroma side though.

Smells strongly of roasted malts, nice chocolate, and sweet cream.  No hops are present in the aroma.  I know they are in there, but the roast overpowers them.  First taste is bitter, but not from hops, from roast.  Almost astringent.  Chocolate and espresso fill your mouth next, very nice, followed by a sharp almost harsh bitterness.  Again from roast not hops.  NIce full, rich, slick mouthfeel.  Oily and coating, from the oats one can presume.  I decided to sit on this for a while and let it warm up seeing as it was very cold from the tap.  At first it seemed to bring out this harshness even more, but after a few drinks, it went away.  It is so much better slightly below room temperature.  Definite balance.  A decent beer.","USA","imrichbeeeatch"

Bites back a little, partly from the carbonation and partly from what I assume is the hop content, which is usually better hidden in stouts.

This is a beer that belies it alcohol content, it has imperial stout complexity, but with an easy drinking stlye that makes me wish the served this at every college bar instead of bland, old Guinness.

The creaminess imparted by the tap adds another dimension to an already sensuous experience. Hop balance is well done, better than their Impy imo.

It¬ís a very black beer with a dark tan head and sticky lacing. The aroma is dead on for this style. Lots of coffee and chocolate,  a little soy sauce, then comes the hops. A nice sprucy, piny bite is in the mix. The palate is medium dense. The flavor is rich of coffee and chocolate with the finish focusing more on the sharp hop presence. A lot of people have second thoughts about  heavy use of U.S. hops in dark ales, but I think that it is delicious when done right. This is a wonderful example of how that should be done, let alone the thick, assertive, balanced more predictable stout qualities.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Poured a thick inky-black with an excellent fairly dark brown creamy, slightly rocky head.  Pretty much perfect looking.  Aroma of dark roasted malt, licorice, rich creamy  chocolate (I swear I smell table cream), hops, caramel, and some loamy richness.  Taste is very over-roasted malty, with enough earthy bitterness to balance, the chocolate and cream tastes come out with warming.  Very creamy and full-bodied mouthfeel, a pleasure to drink.  It finishes slightly bitter, but the full suite of flavours linger too, so that¬ís okay; hardly any alcohol aggressiveness at all.

459,"2005-07-18",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2005 Thanks Chuck!  Pours to a medium thickness dark brown fizzy/creamy head atop a black body.  The head laces well.  The aroma is similar to Dr. Pepper.  A bit too light, however.  I get a LIGHT milk chocolate.  The aroma is VERY WEAK.  The flavor, on the other hand, is rich and dark chocolatey with a light coffee and light grass.  The palate is pretty slick to begin with but then becomes thick and rich once you swish it around.

The nose is standard Rogue fare - perhaps there are traces of prunes and flowers - but the nose is also very noticeably roasted.  What is most striking about this brew is how thick it really is.  The mouthfeel is dense, but it doesn¬ít come across as syrupy. The tastes range from an initial dark fruitiness (prunes?), to a middle creamy chocolatiness, to a long-lasting but only moderately bitter trail.  The alcohol is not noticeable.

A great all around stout that balances the bitter roastiness of the malts and bitterness of the hops without getting ridiculous. Coffee and choclate flavors support the rest of the beer very well.

The flavor was at first very malty, with a nutty flavor that reminded me of coffee and chocolate, almost burnt tasting.

Aroma is strong and hoppy... I smelled it immediately upon opening the bottle, and I was a good foot and a half away from it.  There is also some roasted character in the aroma as well.  There is a strong flavor of coffee upon the first taste, which soon dissolves into dark chocolate (the chocolate becomes more pronounced as the beer warms).  The finish is very bitter, which did not surprise me when I found out that it shares the same IBU¬ís as Stone IPA.  The body is thinner than I expected from the beer, which is its weakest link.

The aroma is slightly acidic in its roastiness, and it has notes of chocolate, espresso, and alcohol.  It has a creamy mouthfeel up front, and a sharp acidic roast malt bite in the finish.  Espresso dominates over the chocolate, which is the opposite sense I got in the aroma.  The dark malt notes of roasted barley, and burnt malt dominates this beer.  Not much in the way of hops is noticeable above all of the roast character, but there is a nice hop bite in the finish that is a bit bracing and let you know that this beer is in fact 69 IBUs.

Not a lot to the aroma. Perhaps my nostils were fried after inhaling the fine aroma of the Gulden Draak. It sorta smelled like flowers with some light oat notes, subtle toffee and loads of chocolate.

Aroma is dark roasted malt & bitter chocolate w some floral hops. Flavor is rather dry & bitter dark roasted malt w a slightly burnt characteristic. A bit sharp & short on smoothness & richness. Lacking real depth & complexity. Large slug of sediment that came out in chunks ( a sign of ""too old"" for me). Bet it would be significantly better fresher or from a keg. Will have to try again and hopefully get a fresher bottle. 10/23/05: I¬ím raising this up .4 but want to leave the original rate. Bottle 22 oz.

Aroma is rich, creamy, drk roast malt & grain w bittersweet chocolate & a moderate floral hoppiness. Flavor is rather dry w dark rst malt & grain, bittersweet chocolate & balanced very well with the hops. A significant bitterness hits early on and carries well into the finish. Pushing the border of full bodied. No alcohol taste detected. There is a noticable trace of spiciness and complexity. This stout falls into the lower end of the sweetness scale which is just right for me. Looking foreward to enjoying this again. I¬íll bet its even smoother & yummier on tap & could well hit a 4.

Aroma is yeasty sour, toasty bitter and a milk-dark chocolate hybrid.  Thick malty undertones of chocolate just carrying on enough to salvage your palate from big bitterness of toasty, brief citrus that vanishes, and an aftertaste lasting long of very toasty bakers chocolate.  Very bitter, very lovely, smoothe, beautiful.  Don¬ít waste the bottle if you¬íre not in the mood for something powerful.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

Aroma is quite complex with a mix of roastiness and choclate, which bring some very enjoyable sweetness. Carbonation is good with a strong body. Taste is quite similar to aroma with the roastiness and chocolate coming out very nicely. The end is more sweet then dry which I enjoyed. Overall, a truly great sweet stout.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Certainly this is better than anything you are likely to find in your local supermarket, but not one to die for. Flavor could be more complex, though it is very good. Nice overall apperance.

459,"2004-04-21",5.0,"A classic if there ever was one. 
The color is an inky cloak of solemn black.
Head is a thick, crusty, toasted brown. Aroma: supreme example of roast, rich and invigorating, potent and powerful, dry and dreamy, a snootful could rise old Yorick from his grave. Further gleanings give more flavors, of anise, espresso, pepper, chocolate. I could smell this all day and think of nothing better to do!
On first taste, I am transported! Beautiful bitterness, lush malt, titanic texture! Thoroughly magical hop play on the palate, to make old Prospero proud, malt as dark and knotted as King Richard's heart. Every single time I have the pleasure to sip this fine ale, any wintry discontent is made glorious summer anon! I happily suffer a sea-change, into something rich and strange!
I feel like the world's mine oyster...mmmm. oy-sters!
From Shakespeare to Simpson, that's how even the best of beers will tranform us all!
Plainly put, the bard of beers does somehow have that bewitching power o'er me, and I am mezmerized good, as I like it. And when the hurlyburly's done, I am left clamoring for more!
I couldn't change a thing about this perfect potion. Some stouts may be more bold or brash in alcohol or flavor, but none is more perfectly integrated in all it's parts and easily drunk and thoroughly enjoyed. Truly, the stuff dreams are made of!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

459,"2003-12-07",3.1,"This stout was very dark and thick looking with a moderate head and good lacing. Hoppy aroma with notes of fruit, pine and tobacco. Medium to full bodied, warm and sweet up front, a bit tangy, with coffee and chocolate flavors but between the roasted malt and all the hops it had an overriding bitterness that I found distracting-seemed unbalanced and a stretch in the style department.","Rhineland, Missouri, USA","Jedsbrew"

OK its the usual high quality screen printed 22 oz bomber we have come to love from Rogue. Says ""world stout champion"" on the label
Well this beer is a work of art to behold ..completelly black even when held to the light..and a marvelous inch high chocolate coloured head..its dissapated to a lovelly lace..I really didnt want to touch this..maybe I will take a picture next time..hang it on my wall..perfect.
Wonderful aroma of all sorts of luscious dark stuff..chocolate, roasted oats,barley espressoo..it goes on and on
MMMMone wonderful tasting stout..its all of the above with added a creaminess..and a lovelly hop bitterness thats does not overwhelm but compliments ( odd for a stout but Rogue pulls it off).

459,"2003-11-13",4.4,"For certain, Rogue is one of my favorite breweries.  This excellent sweet stout is a deep onyx color with a pleasing bouquet like vintate port wine delicately laced with chocolate-covered coffee beans. (nice, huh?)  A sweet, caramel-color head.  Very mellow taste, not a strong, overbearing ""kick yer ass"" taste as is too often the case with stouts.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  A hint of roastiness in the flavor!  A dark chocolate, everso slightly sour finish.","new haven, Connecticut, USA","eraserhd10"

459,"2003-11-07",4.0,"Mellow malty aroma. Roasted malt, but not overpowering. Pours deep, deep brown, nearly black. Decent carbonation and a thick tan head. A great looking beer! I would agree with other raters that this is more of a dry stout than a sweet stout. If it is indeed intended to be a sweet stout, the Cascade hops take away from that effect. I don't believe that Cascade is a traditional hop for stouts, but then again this is from Rogue and they are from Oregon. A quite drinkable brew that balances the malt and hops quite well actually. Dry crisp finish that is also uncharacteristic of a sweet stout and even dry stouts. Not bad if not traditional.","Waconia, Minnesota, USA","davesarman"

459,"2003-10-28",3.5,"A bit dissapointing but perhaps my expectations were a little high.Nice

459,"2003-10-25",3.5,"It pours black with a medium coffee brown head in a La Maudite snifter. Aroma is deep chocolate and coffee. Very nice roasted barley matches solid floral hops. From the first sip, I find it quite sour, reminding me of a Guinness, but much thicker and hoppier. The finish is  astringent and ultra dry (bad), but hops are pleasant and the roastiness is perfectly developped (good). Overall, I must say I expected more from Shakespeare Stout.

459,"2003-10-20",4.2,"Always a favorite of mine and just got around to rating it. Deep brown hue with a nice creamy light brown head and excellent lace, beautiful! Aroma is that of bittersweet chocolate, espresso, aromatic hops, earthy yeast, and a touch of fruit. Taste is bitter with a undertone of sweetness and hazelnut. Full blow use of hops and burnt chocolate malts. The coffee taste is very noticable in this brew, but enough complexity it doesn't become overpowering. Creamy yet lively mouthfeel. Not as sweet as some sweet stout or as dry as some in that style either, a tweener and damn good at it.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
459,"2003-10-17",4.3,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle at 60 degrees F pours a viscous opaque black with a big rocky brown head and a bunch of trailing lace.  The aroma was of chocolate and very mild coffee and some hops to make the chocolate smell like the finest Godiva.  The flavor: wow, very nice dessert beer!  The flavor is of dark chocolate and espresso.  The hops, as in the aroma, marry with the roasted malts to result in a fine dark chocolate flavor.  The palate fits the flavor profile by being nice and rich.  Overall, this is very nice at the end of the meal and marries very well with a chocolate chip cookie and vanilla frozen custard sandwich.  I enjoyed this.  Can you tell?","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

I can't believe this baby has 69 IBUs - sure doesn't taste like it. Coffee and roasted malt dominate the taste. Ashiness - dirt like quality. Sweet.

As the head recedes, it slowly fades into a rocky layer of film atop the beer, and leaves a thick coating of foam on the sides of the glass. A faint glimpse of dark redddish brown highlight is visible around the edge of the beer as you take a sip. The aroma is very nice, with roasted chocolate smells mingled with some hop spiciness. Malt sweetness is also evident in the aroma. The taste is very strong on the hops, and the citrusy notes of the Cascade hops is prominent. Strong roasted bitterness is also prevalent, with some chocolate notes to back it up. A faint hint of sweetness also creeps in on the finish","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"

459,"2003-09-08",2.3,"Beer pours (in Chimay Glass) a thick black liquid that light can not penetrate with dark caramel colored head that dissipates quickly to near nothing but a thin film of head.  Aroma is a bastardly sickening hop and alcohol mixture.  Flavor is a nauseating, disgusting hop overpowering a faint coffee.  I hear great things about Rogue, but the more I try, the more disappointing they are.  This one is almost as bad as Rogue Chocolate Stout.  Still, both are deemed undrinkable drainpours by this rater.  There is nothing to enjoy in this beer besides the stench and revulsion of hops.

459,"2003-07-17",4.2,"Milk chocolate brown head turns to beige when it settles and laces and the liquid is pretty well black.  All those dark grains and hops still come through! Although they are subdued compared to the roasty and chocolate aromas as well as some malty sweetness and a little toffee.  Malty sweetness and roasty/bitter from dark grains start the experience, almost like chewing on coffee beans or drinking espresso.  Chocolate comes in second while hop flavor follows right behind in the finish and aftertaste.  Finish is also dry, lightly diacetyl, and slightly sour from dark grain acidity, and I'm not quite sure why it's qualified as a sweet stout as there is not much residual sweetness.  Fuller bodied with higher than usual carbonation for a stout, but very well made.  It's been a while since I've had one of these, it's good to find it's as good as I remembered it.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

Nose of dark roasted malts with a little hint of chocolate but not much sweetness.  Initial taste is strong, bitterly hoppy and of burnt roasted malts; a little overwhelming, but still enticing-- I could literally feel my mouth swell up with water.  Very creamy texture, extremely smooth going down after the initial taste.  Dark, unsweetened chocolate undertaste, almost sour at first, and then the character of the roast opens up broadly to a nice, frothy chocolate malt flavor.

Rerate:  The aroma of Choc stout, hazelnut, and this are very similar.  Makes me conclude that it's the Pacman yeast.  Aroma is an incredible chocolate milk.  Even with the more watery hazelnut, the same aroma is there.  If this could just
 be incorporated in other beers, this could be monumental.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

459,"2003-05-04",2.8,"This beer pours a dark black color. The first thing you notice is the grapefruit smell of Cascade hops, then the subtle malts start
to kick in. It has a decent enough tannish colored head on it, but it doesn't last long. Smells of roasted barley, and black patent
malt. Has a strong coffee aroma to it, along with an expresso flavor as well. My opinion of this beer is that it's a little on the thin
side, especially for a stout. Other than that, it's a fair beer at best. Not something I would want to drink everyday.","","Cobra"

The coffee flavor that I'd expected is nice and mellow. A touch of chocolate in there too. Hop bitterness overpowered the other flavors, unfortunately. If they tuned down the hops a little, this would be amazing. As it stands, its just pretty darn good. Rerate: Chat Room Tasting, Jan 2004. I'm actually very pleased with my original rating of this beer. Definately stand behind my thought that this is a little too hoppy. Thought about lowering it a point overall, but I'll let it stand, as its still a good beer that I'd be happy to drink almost any time.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"

459,"2003-03-25",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2003 This brew has a very strong roasted chocolaty aroma. The initial pour formed a small head of small dark brown bubbles. As the head died, it left a clinging vine lacing stubbornly letting go of the side of the glass. Its body is dark as midnight although some carbonation could be seen rising up the side of the glass. I eagerly await my initial taste. All of the stout ingredients are there in the taste, coffee, chocolate and roasted flavors greet my mouth as the first taste goes down and leaves a pleasant impression. Relatively smooth I thought and a bit more than I expected for a potentially good stout. No carbonation in the taste at all, no strong after bite and surprisingly smooth for a dark stout. A stout I can drink more of in a night and that says a lot right there.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

Reminds me of a weaker Rasputin.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","BeerPrince"

459,"2003-02-22",4.3,"I went in with low expectations, expecting another Rogue ""overblown with hops"" beer.  Well, it was hoppy, providing a zing and a notable bitterness, but the first flavors were overwhelming: roasted, nutty, chocolate.  Over time the hoppiness was more pronounced, but still this was compulsively drinkable.  It got even better when I took a glass and added vanilla ice cream--WONDERFUL!!-- seemingly hazlenut-vanilla-mocha coffee with a mammoth fizzing head.  The relatively high carbonation (making it a little bit suspect as a stout?) goes over extremely well in the ""stout float"" combination.  Still, despite the carbonation, the palate is good, with a nice thick, oily body.  Really good beer, though I could understand criticisms that it could do with fewer hops.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Loads of flavor, a true assault on the senses with bitter hoppiness and roasted flavors.  Personally, I think it was a little too hoppy and burnt.  Much of the semi-sweet chocoloate flavor didn't really become pronounced until near the end of the bottle.  This stout is more bitter than sweet.

Big black body, a rich thick brown head that has beautiful layers, light on top, darker on bottom.  Chocolatey, smokey, well roasted and a hint of bitter PNW hop character, citrucy almost.  Taste begins chocolatey, and then dances dances with hoppy tones and roasted barley.  Nice smokey notes as well.  The distinctive pacman yeast makes its presence known among the roastey chocolate finish.  Body is smooth and creamy with a bit of a bite, dry palate enhances roastedness.

The beer is almost completely opaque.  I noticed aromas of roasted malt, alcohol, and the light presence of Cascade hops.  The beer has a thick, silky body, but with a surprisingly dry, balanced finish.  I found the flavors to be excellently balanced between bitter astringence and a sweet, chocolatey roastiness.  The palate became more bitter and smoky as I progressed through the 22-ounce bottle.  The first half of the beer was nearly perfect, but the second half was clearly unbalanced toward bitterness, but not as severely as the Saint Rogue Red I had yesterday.

459,"2002-10-11",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2003 This is my favorite beer...period. This is about as close to a perfect stout I think you can find. Beautiful brown frothy head and an excellent bouquet. The label description advertises an ebony color, but I couldn't really place it being so friggin dark. I held a flashlight up to it and could see nothing on the other side, except for some grains visibly floating around the dark liquid. The chocolate malts are very noticeable, and a winderful coffee-like finish - that nests right on your palate. Appropriately bitter (69 IBU) it's in the upper range for a dry stout, but they can be as high as 75. An all around fantastic beer. I think any comparison to Guiness (as I've been seeing here) is a weak one, this stands alone in my opinion.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

459,"2002-09-25",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2005 Re-rated from an aged bottle (approx. 3 years old). Deep black body with a creamy brown head. Inviting aroma of bittersweet cocoa and roasted coffee.

Either this beer improved with age, or my tastes have changed - either way, I¬ím rating it higher this time.

Original rating (9/25/2002): Near perfect appearance, and a great aroma. The chocolate and coffee notes are balanced well, but the hoppiness can be a bit off-putting if you¬íre not expecting it. Not the best stout around, but it¬ís pretty damn good. 8/5/7/4/16","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"

It is a great stout, but it¬ís a little on the bitter side.

It says on the side (and I¬ím still not too old, my vision is pretty good) 158 degrees Plato!  158!  You¬íd need a jackhammer!  Anyway, back to your regularly scheduled rating.  Aroma is almost on the magnitude of a typical West Coast Imperial Stout.  Super roasty malt, cocoa, espresso, even that dark fruitiness and hop are there.  Mostly opaque very dark brown-black color, with a light tan, thick and billowy head.  Lacing is also impressive.  Flavor is very full, even for a typical stout, and has a nice balance from the fruity, bitter Cascades.  Big bittersweet chocolate.  Great mingling of flavors for the finish and aftertaste.  Very roasty and rich, just a little more gravity and this would be an Imperial.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Eeegsh.  I guess I don¬ít understand why so many beer lovers like so many kinds of stout.  (Don¬ít get me wrong; I think I really like the Imperials....)  Well, what to say about this one . . .  I couldn¬ít detect much of any aroma, and what I could detect was pretty stale in character.  Lovely color, as usual, for a stout, but just really damn hard to shovel into my gut.  Decent dark head, but just really heavy and dull in the taste; I¬ím not sure what I¬ím supposed to be picking up here.  Yeah, something chocolate-like in the finish, I guess.  Maybe I¬ím just not a stout guy.  Rogue does good brews, too, so I guess it¬ís me.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

This stout is no exception.  It is welcoming, easy, and flavorful.  It¬ís color is black, it¬ís aroma gentle, and its flavor well balanced without any surprises (beyond how good it tastes).

Perfectly black with a dark creamy head that looks a little like a chocolate milkshake. The taste and mouthfeel are equally excellent and are much like drinking an espresso flavored glass of thin chocolate milk minus the lactic and sucrose sweetness (although a small bit of that is present) Nice roasty and hoppy bitterness.

i managed to choke down a couple, but maaaan.

Despite some experiences that were of a dry bitter beer with low malt profile, my early and most recent samplings were more consistent: full malt palate, with roast, chocolate and just a little coffee.  Nicely smooth.  Piney and citrusy hop aromatics and hoppy finish.  One of the hoppier, esp. in terms of finishing hops, of the stouts out there.  Overall quite enjoyable.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

Its dark head died quick, and there was nary a coffee or chocolate flavor. It looked great and had a nice level of bitterness, but the strong cascade hop aftertaste is what ruined this for me. Despite the fact I¬íve mostly noted negative points, I did enjoy it, just not nearly as much as I had hoped.  The fact that it came in a 22 oz bottle didn¬ít help much either.  Given the task of finishing the bottle came to feel like a job...it was as if I was being punished and didn¬ít know why.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

459,"2001-07-10",4.3,"This is a well balanced beer with ample hoppiness and coffee and roasted malt characteristics.  The hop aroma overpowers the malt aroma, althjough both are detectable.

459,"2001-05-24",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2003 Very dark and impressively foamy. Burnt coffee-like aroma, but especially PNW style hoppy at the same time. Hops dominate, almost in an IPA-ish kind of way at first, while the sweet roasted barley and chocolate follow in the second half. Aftertaste is dry and incredibly bitter for the style almost like a Sierra Pale ale. It mellows in the aftertaste which should be savored as the burnt mocha like notes come through. Further tatsing reveals nice creaminess. One of USA's best and most original beers.","California, USA","BeerLimey"

Actually, the beer I had was in a bottle titled 'Wild Irish Rogue"".  
A bit of research revealed that this is the Shakespeare Stout in a different bottle for St. Patricks Day.  Please alert me if I""m wrong.
Anyway, this is by far the ugliest beer I""ve ever seen.  It looks like it leached out of the ground at a toxic waste dump.
It""s also one of the strangest.  The flavor is overpowering, at first.  After the first few sips, I was contemplating alternate uses for this stuff, such as cleaning the car engine or maybe sealing the driveway.
But then the beer cast it""s spell on me and, to my disbelief, I happily drank the whole thing (I think the oatmeal did the trick).

This beer is very fragile, though, since it is unfilter and unpasteurized- I¬íve had bottles that made me think this was one of the ten best beers on earth, and bottles which made me think a Rogue employee had relieved himself in the brewing tank.

The aromas of rich roasted malt, coffee, brown sugar sweet, also a light hop floral scent to seal off the nose. Start is bitter chocolate sweet, malt and the top thick and chewy, with a finish that is hop bitter and purposeful in its bite. The carbonation moderate and the aftertaste dry and long lasting.
