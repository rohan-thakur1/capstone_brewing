2553,"2015-04-30",3.0,"Very non-descript beer with little hops, little malt and clearly going for lager lovers, but overall I didnt mind it.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
2553,"2011-02-09",3.0,"Tap. Very nice for the style. Aromas of lemon and leaves, with a touch of band-aid. Taste is sweet, with bitter notes. Palate is oily, with a thin-to-medium body. Yellow, with a frothy head.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","davidm"
2553,"2011-01-24",3.0,"On tap at the brewpub. Decent for a lighter beer. Enough hops and malt flavours to keep from getting bored, but still could tell it was a light. Citrus, caramel and biscuit were the dominant force in here.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","ndon"
2553,"2009-08-29",2.5,"...on tap there.  Amazingly clean, but flavorful light beer.  Just good all around for a light beer with some flavor of hops, slight malt, and crisp clean aftertaste.  This even had lacing, was smooth and silky.  Nice.","Central Florida(Upper Hell), Florida, USA","UnholyBrewing"
2553,"2009-08-13",3.1,"Tap. A golden ale with a average white frothy head. Aroma and flavor dominated by the citrus hops with a balanced finish. Simple and well executed-pretty good for a mid-strength beer.","Ngunnawal, AUSTRALIA","mickmac"
2553,"2009-06-08",2.7,"Tried on tap at Wig and Pen back in May. A light beer to finish the night off, it drank alright and did not taste watery, noticed the hops in the aroma and the taste.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
2553,"2007-06-15",2.3,"On taste I would not have picked this as a light beer.  Orange colour and a spritzy fizzy taste.  Lots of citrus but some grass too.  Very very different.  Good for a light beer.","Canberra ACT, AUSTRALIA","madquacker"
2553,"2006-05-27",2.9,"28 Mar 2006 - Passionfruit and light spiced aroma.  Clear light amber-yellow  colour, reasonable head and sheet lacing.  Hoppy passionfruit flavour, perhaps a bit too simplistic.  Crisp, thin, easy drinking, light bitter hop aftertaste.","Glen Iris, AUSTRALIA","vanvenlo"
2553,"2006-04-26",2.2,"Slightly dark amber, looks industrial, unremarkable. No real head to speak of. Nose does give much and possibly serviced a bit too cold. Palate shapes up ok for a 3% - light weight, quite fizzy but has some faint (yet definate) herbal, spicy notes - reminisce of a Belgium wit. Flavours are faint at best and needs more beer character. But once again not bad for a 3%.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"
2553,"2006-03-29",2.6,"Malt hop aroma. Clear amber colour with good head and lacing. Bitter malt flavour. Fizzy palate. This is a good to have when one has to do the driving.","Glen Iris, AUSTRALIA","Lunkie"
2553,"2006-03-26",2.8,"on tap at the brewpub. not bad light beer. a little lychee and pine in the aroma. pretty light-bodied, tasted mainly of orange mango cordial but thats my favourite flavour of cordial so i was pleased","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
2553,"2006-02-07",3.6,"Draught at the brewpub.  Clear deep golden. Grassy, fruity hop aroma with lots of mango. Fairrly light bodied with surprising rounded maltiness. A welath of hops adds intriguing tropical fruity tones and medium bitterness. Refreshing and very drinkable. One of the best 3% beers Ive tasted!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2553,"2006-01-08",3.3,"Happy to go against the grain here because I really liked this. We left this to last during a visit to the brewpub because... well, who really wants to drink light beer? So its all the more surprising that this stood out after a fairly long nights tasting including a robust stout and a couple of pale ales. Those low expectations seemed to be confirmed by the appearance: pale gold with a skinny corona and some of the busiest carbonation Ive seen in a beer. However, the aroma was amazingly intense for a 3% abv beer. Quite floral, with some tangy citrus and strong honey notes. Despite the fat bubbles, the carbonation was moderate and quite soft. Very thin in the body but thats to be expected. The flavours were almost as intense as the aroma - lychee, apricot... could these be the same hops that Emersons use in their Organic Pilsener? Thats the closest comparison I can make. If Ive gone overboard about this, put it down to shock at finding a light beer with some character. (Draught at brewpub with omhper)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
2553,"2005-06-25",3.2,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2009 (08 rerate)Much better! Nice basic English pale ale molt profile and some mild hops. Pretty good quality low alcohol beer!

(05 - 1.6)Pretty sub-standard all round really. Lacking any real substance of any sort. Agree with mullet that Moonlite is the much better light beer. Wig and pen’s worst.","AUSTRALIA","Nesta13"
