I sense lighter fruits - pear, passion fruit present themselves here. The flavor profile is indeed decadent for the style - the intensity ramps up with more orange blossom, light bitter, mild oak, light fruits, with a viscous, stickiness that finishes with more pear and honey.

Huge aroma with sweet honey, orange, raw oak (lots), and a definite alcohol kick. Infinitely more pleasant flavor that hits sweet with plenty of honey and orange right away. That raw oak presence hits hard as plain wood/oak and touches of vanilla and cream that blend well into the orange and honey aspects. The alcohol is better hidden in the flavor. Sweet and definitely woody, but otherwise this is pretty tasty.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

The nose is a decadent blend of sweet, pale honey with fragrant citrus blossoms, and lush, decadent, vanilla kissed oak.  Smells great.  Flavors largely follow suit, though there is a hint of background acidity that lends a nice balance.  Honey is light, golden, and super fresh tasting.  The citrusy florals really come through nicely, working nicely with the warm, oaky barrel notes.
