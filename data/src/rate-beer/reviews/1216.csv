Medium aroma of malts, caramel, dark fruit, chocolate, bread, roasted malts and smoke.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque red/dark brown beer with heavy yeast and with a slight/medium beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, dark fruit, chocolate and molasses; ends slightly bitter and dry with bread, roasted malts and smoke.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Rather sweet start with loads of fruit and chocolate. Could have used some more roasted and smoky flavours. Great at every aspect, but the aroma could have been slightly better.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Smaak: Donker fruit en, rozijnen, karamel, geroosterde mout en een lekkere gerookte smaak als gerookt ham...gelukkig niet te sterk en licht een chocolade hint. Het zoete komt mooi boven de peat uit. Wat kruidig en een beetje alcohol geven een warm gevoel. Lichte hopbitter... eerder iets spicy gehopt.
