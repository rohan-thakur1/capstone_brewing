3762,"2017-05-07",3.4,"Had a slight pop when I open the bottle still its somewhat flat. Aromas basically caramel toffee malt. Flavors good with the above malt, fruit, sweet and a bit tart. Better carbonation would have helped a lot.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
3762,"2017-03-02",3.5,"Poured into weizen glass, the appearance was a dark ruby red color with a two finger white foamy head that dissipated at a moderate pace. Some clingy foamy messy lace.
The aroma brings together some clove, apple cider, raisins, caramel and sweet wheat up front. Light dark chocolate and then a light fig-like to molasses sweetened wheat bread comes in nicely.
The flavor melds the spice to the sweet through all of the previously mentioned aromas. Seems like a bit of mulled cider comes through in the taste. Wheaty to semi-sticky sweet aftertaste biting into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about medium on the body, maybe just a touch under. Carbonation seems a bit more than expected. And with the spices coming across the way they do, this one seems to be a bit harsher on my tongue than some other weizenbocks Ive had.
Overall, for the most part, aroma and flavor is what really makes this beer great. The mouthfeel, well, its a bit pricklier than expected. I could still have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3762,"2017-01-17",4.1,"750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased at brewery in Brossard, Quebec. Poured into small Sam Adams Utopias snifter. Slightly cloudy brownish-red color. Visible carbonation, yet no head or lacing. Has a distinct balsamic vinegar and apple cider aroma, which is a little off-putting even though its appropriate for the style; thankfully, I also detect raisins, caramel and, oddly, soy sauce. Flavor is of all the above  minus the vinegar, mercifully  along with dark-chocolate-covered cherries, figs, dates, plantains sautéed in brandy, whole wheat molasses bread. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation on the tongue; slightly oily mouthfeel along with a spicy, smoky, yeasty softness and the slightest hop bitterness. It tastes as if its been oak-barrel aged, yet it hasnt; its simply the magic of the wheat-based ingredients, which happen to be 100 percent sourced from Quebec  a respectable distinguishing factor about this brewery. This beer, with this sweet and savory taste profile and its 10.5 percent alcohol, is definitely an appetizer or dessert sipper  and what an enjoyable one it is!","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"
3762,"2017-01-03",3.6,"Average creamy frothy offwhite head. Good lacing. Mostly diminishing. Cloudy thick dark reddish-brown body. Aroma: moderate toasted malty, caramel, citrus lemon, raisin, plum. Initial flavor: heavy sweet. Final flavor: heavy sweet,light acidic and moderate bitter; long duration. Palate: medium full body, oily texture, lively carbonation, metallic and moderate alcoholic finish. Mesmo com o relativo equilíbrio oferecido pelo amargor do lúpulo northern brewer e do ligeiro azedume lembrando ameixa fresca, a cerveja tem excessivo dulçor maltado/caramelado, tornando-a enjoativa. Com o ganho de temperatura, tal acidez aumenta, equilibrando um pouco mais a cerveja, mas fugindo das diretrizes do estilo (BJCP) uma vez que a acidez não está prevista para uma weizenbock. Em minha opinião, equilibra bem, no entanto. Apesar de aroma e sabor fugirem das BJCP, a meu ver é uma interessante interpretação do estilo, diferenciada, saborosa, uma vez que as Weizenbock geralmente são bem repetitivas. Médio aquecimento alcoólico e média drinkability. Apesar disso, a cerveja consegue esconder relativamente bem o alto teor alcoólico de 10,5%.

3762,"2016-01-19",3.3,"bottle @ Party Source / Bellevue KY --- Clear brown color, thin white head cover, lace spots.

Dun brun/orange très opaque, son côté très boueux ma peu séduit. Les deux plus vieilles quant à elles étaient plus jolies. Il faut croire que le liquide se clarifie quelque peu avec le temps et coiffe une robe dune couleur qui tend vers des teintes pourpres. Au nez, la plus jeune sen sort pas mal (quel début de phrase douteux...) avec des arômes principalement composés de sucre dorge et de bananes. Beaucoup de sucre. Ces arômes sont étonnamment très sensibles au temps car les 2011 et 2010 exposaient des arômes dacidité importants. Joserais même ajouter un nez vinaigré et quelque peu fongique. Pour les trois années, le palais et la langue est très cohérente avec le nez. Aucune surprise. Bref, lexpérience fut intéressante même si ce type de bière nest absolument pas le mien.

Aroma is dark fruits (raisins, plumbs & prunes), yeast, banana and caramel. Smells reminds me of a quad. Taste is caramel and toasted malts, banana, dark fruits and alcohol.

3762,"2014-01-03",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2015 Bière brune pâle tirant vers lorangée-cuivrée, bien voilée, bonne effervescence, et surmontée dun col brunâtre pas tellement large, mais bien dense, mousseux et persistant. Arômes de malt et de levure à weizen. Effluves de pain légèrement grillé, pâtisserie, pâte à pain, grain moyennement rôti, noisette, léger sucré (caramel, érable et crème brûlée), et léger fruits foncés confits (raisins secs, pruneaux, dattes). La levure amène des arômes de banane très mûre et léger clou de girofle, eucalyptus et vanille. Cependant, jai bu cette bière à plusieurs reprises, et je dois dire quelle présente malheureusement parfois de subtiles odeurs esters excessifs (solvant, vernis). Nez moyennement agréable, complexité élevée, bonne intensité. En bouche, pétillement moyen-faible sur la langue, mais onctuosité élevée au palais, le breuvage est soyeux et velouté. Au goût, entrée en bouche bien malté et sucré, pain légèrement grillé, pâtisserie, noisette, plus sucré quau nez (abondant caramel et sirop dérable!), et fruits foncés confits. La levure à weizen est moins présente en bouche quau nez, mais il y a définitivement une saveur de banane bien mûre, de banane caramélisé. Lalcool est présent au goût, mais cest très bien intégré, on perçoit surtout son aspect chaleureux en gorge et dans lestomac. La finale amène un certain houblon qui semble surtout floral, peut-être légèrement mentholé, en route vers une amertume somme toute assez légère mais tout de même bien sentie. Cest pas mal sucré comme bière, mais personnellement, jaime bien ça. Bonne intensité en bouche, mais complexité un peu plus faible quau nez, et qui aurait certainement pu être un peu mieux considérant le style. Mais, il sagit définitivement dune très bonne bière! /// Sur la bouteille, il est indiqué quun vieillissement de 3 à 5 ans est possible. Jai donc laissé une bouteille en cellier pendant 3 ans. Au visuel, la bière était plus foncée avec présence de particules pouvant être assez grosses, et au nez, des notes doxydation (carton) sont apparues. Au goût, jai cependant noté peu de différences, peut-être un certain adoucissement, voire affadissement des saveurs. Donc, pas vraiment de bonification liée au vieillissement. Jai dautres bouteilles en cellier, jessaierai un vieillissement de 5 ans, voire 6 ans","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","pumpkinhead2"

We cant get american beers except a few uninteresting ones.  Do you want an Old Milwaukee?  So this beer is the only Weizenbock I ever had with the Aventinus.  Even if high in ABV, the alchool is not that noticeable.  Very fruity and tongue-tingling spices are very obvious, and so is the presence of leafy hops.  Quite complex and more warming than refreshing or easy to drink.  All in all, a pretty enjoyable Extreme brew.","Terrebonne, Quebec, CANADA","bedainedebiere"

I was expecting something at least remotely similar to Aventinus, but this could not be any more different. Still seems almost vaguely Imperial Stout like to me for some reason.

3762,"2007-02-23",3.1,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2007 Belle mousse fine, tenace, belle dentelle, belle couleur brune foncée avec reflets rouges, limpide avec traces de levure.
Arômes de malt, alcool, herbes, olives kalamata, fumé.
Goût très puissant, mélasse, dattes, malt rôti, bananes, légère acidité, amertume surprenante, se rapprochent dun barley wine. Long étalement sucré (trop), alcool de plus en plus présent, trop jeune, manque de finesse et déquilibre, difficile à terminer pour moi.

3762,"2007-01-29",4.3,"Bottle. Dark brown body with a big creamy tan-khaki head. Sweet sugary caramel aroma with light alcohol in the background. Very similar flavour, lots of rich malty caramel, light sugars, mild fruity undertones. Alcohol is pleasantly noticable, understated for 10%!  Alcohol starts to come out a bit more as it warms, and threatens to be a nuisance if it gets too warm but it is tasty enough that it does not last that long. Creamy medium palateis very nice. More bock than weizen. Delicious! Most pleasant surprise in a while.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
3762,"2007-01-27",4.1,"Bottle (341ml).  Via trade with Viper666 - thanks, J-F!.  Poured thick murky deep brown with a smallish beige fizzy/creamy head - looks mysterious and Im stoked to drink it (4+).  Smells lovely - honey, chocolate, caramel malt, alcohol, some herbal bitterness - really, this smells terrific.  Taste - wow.  Just; wow.  Thick, chocolate and toffee, tons of sweet malt, ear-warming but not ""hot"" - like an awesome scotch ale with more chocolate character.  Wow.  Thick, thick, thick body, mild carbonation, a little astringency trying - and failing - to compete with the lush malt and alcohol character - ultimately well balanced and just what I wanted on a cold winter day.  I want more.  I must conclude Snoro doesnt like beer - perhaps if you dont like dark beer you  1) shouldnt drink it 2) shouldnt down-check it just because you dont like it.

Dark, dirty brown pour with a lasting dark tan bit of head and decent lacing....rich, deep caramelly nose with expected bananas and spice though theres more complexity in the spicing than usual, cardamom and pepper alongside typical clove.....super-rich, decadent body, somewhat rough and yeasty, sweet and caky with bananas cooked in cream, faint alcohol towards the finish, molasses and raisins....full mouthfeel, moderate tasteful carbonation; a delight and easily the best beer yet from this improving brewery.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

The taste is quite good, with a sweet fruity malt, vanilla fudge, licroice. A smooth warming alcohol comes out well in final. A rich and round body. One of their better offerings.

3762,"2006-12-14",3.8,"Any first impressions?
-A rich, full head of foam proudly crowns the cloudy purple-tinged dark brown.
-Quirky plums and herbal spiciness dont quite match with the underlying leather component in the nose.
-Bold black grapes are succulently leaking into the filling fruit cake, as hoppy bitterness attempts to balance things out. Too complex a flavor profile to be assessed on the first sips.
-The portly body is well-carbonated with lively yet soft bubbling, which fits the style.

What if you dig deeper?
-Alcohol warming is fitting, and never intrusive.
-Prunes and dates emerge from the port wine sweetness, and the non-denominational hoppy strength is seamlessly segued.
-A smidge of tartness clashes with the leather in the aroma (with iodine beneath?), and this worries me somewhat, especially for aging purposes.
-Its flavor and body are stupendously developed and comforting, this is a marvelous creation from Trois Mousquetaires. Imagine the flavor profile of Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock and carbonate it à la Aventinus Weizenbock, add a surreptitious leather whip, and youve got yourself a fascinating rendition of this broad and underdeveloped style.

3762,"2006-12-14",3.4,"Warming crunched cereal juice, prune puree, molasses and leather make for a rich and satisfying nose. Quite yeasty, yet residual sugars and concentration are the dominant aspect. Cloudy medium brown hue is kept from darkness by the shy wheat. Wearing a fine light beige crown that mostly lasts. Plenty of persistence in the finish, with rancio flavors emerging on top of the phenols. Tastes like it has been lagered for a while. Full creamy body displaying smooth carbonation that is one of its few differences from liquorous late-evening drink, almost playing in the ballpark of Samichlaus in that regard. Concentrated fruitiness through and through with lots of boldness, earthy and leathery. Kinda sticky after a few sips, but does not grow hard to drink and the alcohol remains under control despite its warmth. Impressive winter beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
3762,"2006-11-16",3.9,"Au nez, quelques vestiges éthérés du travail de la levure de weizen, de même quun léger arôme de mélasse qui laisse présager une bonne dose de malt. À loeil, brune opaque, un peu trouble. Mousse dorée qui se fait discrète. Au goût, rondeur en bouche incroyable. Malt corpulent dont le goût reste imprégné pendant plusieurs secondes. Les 10% dalcool sont bien ressentis.  Une superbe bière dhiver, jai pour mions dire!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","AGB"
