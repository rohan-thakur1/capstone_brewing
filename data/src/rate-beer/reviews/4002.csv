4002,"2017-06-04",3.6,"Black, tan head, nice lacing, and decent head retention. Roast, mild licorice, dark fruit, mild alcohol, pine, and mild medicine notes. Medium bodied, malty front and hoppy finish, high roast & pine, and mild alcohol notes. High roast and hip notes, mildly astringent, and lingering hip bitterness. In summary, great nose, but flavor & palate miss mark due to astringent characters.

4002,"2017-03-21",3.9,"Pours a dark brown-black, thick and welcoming, offering up a respectable beige head with plenty of lace. Nose is surprisingly green and citric, more hop-forward than usual for an IPAs roasty cousin. Taste is primarily West Coast and bitter, large citrus-leaning hops giving up grapefruit and orange with a medicinal bitter background. Roasted malts add a mocha-tinged sweetness, with a slight hit of cherry popping up near the rear. Finishes semi-dry, the hops growing clingy and resinous, a mild note of unsweetened chocolate lurking on the periphery. Textures okay, a bit spiky but nothing too terrible. Solid Black IPA; always nice to see an example of the style that cant be simply summed up as a hoppy porter.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

4002,"2017-01-26",3.4,"From a 22floz bottle purchased in the St. Louis area for $4 and poured into a nonic glass. This must be the 2016 Fall edition as the bottle states an 8% ABV. Consumed 01.26.2017. There is not a freshness date, no bottling location (could be either CA or IL). It appears dark with a glistening tan head. Aromatics are of anise and molasses. Flavor is similar, although a piney hoppiness  and a bit of fig comes through. Textually it is mildly carbonated and the alcohol content is well masked. A pretty good black IPA typical in beery satisfaction to others Ive had in the style. This isnt a favored style for me. Yet, I enjoy the contradiction sometimes.","","balloonbuffoon"

Pours almost black with dark brown hues when held up to light. The head is big and leaves nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is just wonderfully bright and hoppy. This is one where blindfolded I could never tell its black IPA. Thats not to mention that there is practically zero booziness to the bouquet for a beer pushing 9% abv. Its got all sorts of citrus zest & fresh grapefruit with a little muskmelon and dank hop character. Geeze man, this smells so nice. 

The flavor follows suit with the grapefruit & citrus zest. There is a little more pineyness in the flavor & a pretty nice smack of hop bitterness. The light roasty malt presence is defiantly noticeable, but not in an especially bad way, similarly is the case with the booze, you can tell its strong but at no point does the alcohol play an interfering role with the other flavors.

4002,"2014-09-29",3.8,"Sampled May 2014
A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two-finger thick, light brown tinged, creamed amber colored head that leaves some nicely layered lacing stuck to the sides as I work my way through this beer. The beer is a concentrated brown color (sort of like a darker chocolate) that shows a clear, concentrated amber / brown hue when held up to the light. Up front the aroma smells of bright hop fruit notes; ripe tangelo zest, kumquat, lots of guava notes, perhaps a touch of mango, sweet floral peach, as well as ample passion fruit. You actually have to focus, and dig around a bit to notice the dark malt, which supplies subtle, toasted whole grain toast notes, a touch of toasted / slightly-roasted hay, and just a touch of burnt dark malt character that almost adds a spiciness to the dominant hop fruit character; this last helps to accentuate notes of pine, as well as a lightly dank herbal character in the hops, though this last seems to add a funky edge to the tropical fruit notes, rather than be notable in-and-of itself.

Up front a bright fruit character is pretty quickly joined by a toasted whole grain dark malt character. The bitterness is fairly smooth and light for a hopped up beer, and actually the light roast character provides a touch of noticeable bitterness. Bright fruit notes of guava, passion fruit, a bit of spicy mango, and sweet ruby-red grapefruit play the dominant role here in the flavor. Roasted notes lightly influence the flavor to, and become dominant in the finish, though cant quite shake loose a bit of lingering fruity and herbal hop character. As the beer warms up the roast character becomes a bit more noticeable; more toasted / roasted whole grain notes, a bit of roasted coffee notes and burnt grain character, as well as a bit more roasted bitterness. The body has a nice, velvety texture to it without being overly heavy; this beer definitely has the quaffability quotient that something labeled an IPA needs, and at 8+% makes for a bit on the dangerous side if you are not paying attention.

The dark malt is really well done here to not overly detract from the hop focus. I am actually pretty impressed with how little a role it plays in the nose, and even in the flavor it only plays a lightly supporting role; the malt adds a spicy & herbal edge to the hop character more than being overly noticeable by itself. Thoroughly enjoyable for the hop heads out there.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavors in Black IPAs are often extremely complex but this one takes it to another level. Dark fruit flavors (plumb and prune with subtler notes of grape and raspberry), citrusy fruit flavors (grapefruit, pinapple, and orange peel), spicy flavors (pepper, mostly), toasted malt flavors (chocolate, coffee, caramel), and sweet boozy flavors (a candy-like sweetness; some reviews say its like black licorice - thats pretty close).

4002,"2014-07-30",3.7,"On draft at Fat Heads Brewers Brawl

I actually had no intentions of stopping by Lagunitas except that their booth was one of a few with no line. This release, fresh from the brewery in Chicago, shows that they continue to excel. How they can make such nice beers and keep a low price point in a crowded market is beyond me. Whatever they are doing I hope they keep it up.

Aroma / Appearance - A creamy black base swirls fluidly around the glass. Little bursts of carbonation escape from time to time. Malt, chocolate, and the smells of rustic hops bring to mind a remote cabin in the woods where a pot of coffee has been left too long to brew.

Flavor / Palate - Smooth from start to finish, the texture is well balanced. Earthy coffee, malt, and balanced hops emerge after just a few sips. Not the usual beer I would go for on a steamy summer afternoon it still manages to capture the essence of a black IPA perfectly. Grab a bottle and try it for yourself.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

It finally came out hoppy (Yea!), zest, tart tangerine, and a hint of pine. Even after a while only traces of dark malt work their way out. The flavor is more malt forward, chocolate with a smattering of coffee grounds. The citrus hop tastes join in to round the flavor out, modestly bitter but gradually intensifying, and they linger for quite some time in the finish, getting more lemony.

Poured very dark brown, almost pitch black color with three fingers of khaki tan frothy head. Healthy amount of thick layered foamy lacing along the sides of the glass. Great retention on the top all the way down. 

Smelled a decent whiff of hops up front, surprisingly. Citrus hops, grapefruit rind, tangerine and floral hops. That gave way to dark chocolate, cocoa, cocoa nibs and some roasty malts. The hops really dominate here though.

Tasted pretty good, but not quite as nice as the smell. Not as hoppy either, but still a rather bitter finish. Sharp citrus hops, tangerine, orange rind and some floral hops. Also tropical hops, mainly mango and pineapple. Light roasty chocolate. 

Medium body. Creamy texture. Lively carbonation. Long, bitter finish.

A: Thick black body with a big fluffy cappuccino head. 

N: Gigantic hop aroma. Pineapple, grapefruit, pine, earth, toffee, and some orange syrup. A touch of cocoa and coffee and roast, but that could also originate from my mind translating the color to taste. (Not in a synesthetic way.) 

T: Softly bitter with a touch of malt. 

M: Resinous, pillowy, medium bodied.

O: Without looking at this, one would think its a deep golden DIPA. The stout nature of something like Wookey Jack falls by the wayside. The dark malt adds an element of roast, certainly, but this is definitely closer to IPA land (and Lagunitas Sucks) than hoppy stout.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Le nez est bien touffu en conifères et en pamplemousses avec une touche de malts bruns et noirs qui font soupirer dautres fruits tropicaux. Très intéressant mais pas explosif ni renversant. Au goût, des agrumes et des arbres verts qui grimpent sur mes papilles pour ne jamais les lâcher. Les malts arrondissent le tout avec du chocolat et des notes rôties. Encore une fois, agréables saveurs qui ne me font pas basculer dans la zone du merveilleux. En bouche, jai la sensation dun liquide crémeux comme peut lêtre une bonne crème à 35% de matière grasse.

4002,"2014-06-11",3.6,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass 
Appearance  The beer pours a dark brown nearly black color with a one finger head of a tan colored foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time to leave a great level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass
Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of hoppy smells with lots of pine and a decent showing of some grapefruit and earthy smells. Along with these aromas are some roasted malt aromas as well as some chocolate smells with other sweeter aromas of a rather strong caramel and a lighter tangerine and pineapple aroma. Overall rather inviting.
Taste  The taste begins with an odd blend of a bready and lightly roasted flavor with some caramel and lighter fruit flavors. Some light grapefruit hop flavors and a little bit of a chocolate flavor is also present upfront, but these two flavors are quite light. Actually, overall the flavor is rather bland upfront with it being relatively light for a beer of 8.2 %. It does intensify in roast, hop, and chocolate as the flavor advances though with the light fruit flavors that were present upfront fading from the taste. The hop flavors intensify by the coming of some lighter pine and grassy flavors coming to the tongue and with a slight increase in the grapefruit. These transitions do help the flavor overall, but even so, the hop and roasted flavors are a little bit lighter then would have been anticipated, leaving a mid-range hoppy and dark taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on average side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is a little on the lower side. The lower carbonation is quite nice for accentuating the somewhat lighter hoppy and roasted flavors, enhancing them overall, but a slightly thicker body would have done an even nicer job of this, leaving the beer with just a slightly above average feel overall.
Overall  The brew looks and smells fantastic, but the beginning of the taste and the mouthfeel were kind of off at times. A decent brew, but really not all that outstanding overall.","","Darkmagus82"
4002,"2014-06-11",3.9,"Draft at Beer Culture with Paul. Pours a black body with superbly thick head and lacing. Aroma is fresh grass, tropical fruit and melon. Also, some very subtle smoked meat - not really any roasted character thats typically found in a black IPA - more so just very faint woody meat flavor.

Pours an opaque very dark brown with a billowy, fluffy dark tan head. Im surprised at how strong and long lasting the head is and it is very impressive for this strong of a beer.

Aroma is a great mixture of pine tar, earth and roasted, almost burnt malt. Slight dark chocolate and coffee notes underneath.

The flavor is even better than the aroma. Huge shot of pine and earth, almost like being in a pine forest. Just wet pine needles everywhere. This is complimented by a large amount of roasted malt with almost a charred character. The coffee and chocolate are much more subdued here. A touch of wet grass towards the finish with a high bitterness throughout.

4002,"2014-06-03",3.2,"Very complicated aroma of roasted malt (similar to Guinness), strong pine hops, charcoal, weed (I heard it smells like this) and beef boullion. I couldnt stop smelling it. The only thing that slightly spoils the aroma for me is that it has traces of B.O. Pours black as night with paradoxically light off-white foam. Looks way more like a stout than a black IPA. Taste is very smoky, charcoal-esque, faint hop bitterness, not much else. I like the smoke, but I could have used more depth. The palate is a little watery, I have found most black IPAs to be this way. Overall very unique, reasonably priced, I cant say Ive had anything like it. That is not to say I would buy it again, but Im glad I tried it.","Missouri, USA","coachd"
4002,"2014-06-03",3.8,"22 oz Bottle. Tasted on 6/2/14. Bottle from Total Wine & More. The aroma has citrus, roasted malt, mild chocolate hints, the Lagunitas scent on the nose.

Despite the decent ABV, it seems to finish smoother than most IPAs (or coffees for that matter!) Nice bit of warming after the finish though.

I dont know if Ive ever smelled something like that coming from a dark beer! That follows right into the flavor with a sweet orange taste that is immediately followed by a milk chocolate smoothness and taste, and then a drying, astringent bitterness and alcohol bite. All of this shouldnt make any sense at all, but it does here and its incredibly, perfectly balanced. Finishes with a lasting burn along with chocolate and dry citrus rind.

Taste is milder than expected from the nose but follows suit, leading out bitter... and... pretty much staying bitter, against a mild malt background. Mouth feel is medium bodied and dry as hell, with a lingering bitter finish.

This is one hell of a black IPA. Its not as unidimensional as a single hop, but the citrusy hops (Citra? Simcoe?) are far and away the dominant characteristic. (For a hop head like me, this is a good thing.) I found the alcohol to be well hidden in the flavour, and only apparent as a gentle warming as the bottle progressed. I could drink a hell of a lot of this.","CANADA","UXO"

The palate follows the nose with huge layers of hop complexity, definitely tasting some citra in there. Skittles, pine, coffee, caramel, cocoa, toasted wheat bread.

4002,"2014-05-21",4.6,"> Black IPA masterpiece puts all beers above $5 to shame
[ Bottle ][ Royal Liquor Encinitas ][ 22oz ][ $5 ][ Hangar 24 Snifter Tulip ][ 5/21/14 ]
>> Pours dark sepia, clear, no bottle conditioning it seems; which is good for these super hoppy styles. Head formation is massive, insane retention, huge lacing. Perfect. Nose is animal and savory, mole sauce, overripe papaya, cocoa dusted flank steak, toasted macadamia nut, vanilla, something like tropical barbecue like Malaysian or Phillipino satay/street food. It is quite amazing. Taste is ultra silky and nicely bitter, an automatic 5 for palate. So amazing in mouthfeel, lightly stinging bitterness and a hint of grilled tropical fruit. Buoyant salinity, mild alcohol warmth, melted chocolate and toasted macadamia nut cookie. Really, what else can you ask for in this style. Easily ups the bar for Black IPA. I mean for all the hype Hill Farmstead gets for their Black IPAs, this is better. It just so happens to be cheap and easily available, and for that we should be praising Lagunitas in the streets. If you could just have Lagunitas DayTime, Sucks, and NightTime; you could die a happy man. 
>!< a beer this good for $5 makes me wonder what the hell Ive been doing all of my life. This is my highest rated shelf turd after 8,000 unique beers drank.

This is a bit sweet and that helps to bring out a mild roasted note from the dark grain. Unfortunately though the sweetness does get a bit heavy on the palate after a while.

Black IPAs are interesting creatures... Dark, kind of like a good stout, yet hoppy and (if done well) refreshing like a good hoppy IPA. This one hits on both features - pours dark yet not unclear with a touch of head, with a pretty hoppy aroma. 

Hops come through nicely, but not overwhelmingly. Caramel hints. I've seen the word ""earthy"" used for this beer - that seems to fit nicely.

The taste is rich, roasty, earthy, varnish, grapefruit, peppery, prickly, pine needles and lemon peel with a dry finish. Medium body and fine, prickly carbonation. Pretty alright. Or awesome.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
4002,"2014-05-09",3.7,"Bottle @ Chez Bruce. Deep brown, small head. Very woody. Some melon and slightly smoked pineapple. Caramel, some roasted grain. Earthy bitterness. Melon. That skunky biomass. Strong bitter finish. Medium body, active carb. Im a fan.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4002,"2014-05-09",3.3,"~Strong piney citrusy aroma with chocolate and roasty notes. Makes my mouth water
~Pours a very dark brown almost black with lasting creamy brownish head.
~Piney, woodsy, citrusy flavor that seems muddled with chocolate and roast.
~medium bodied, medium CO2, lingering woody roasty finish.
~Meh.. I was looking forward to this after the aroma, but the flavor is kind of a mess. Ill still drink it its just not all that enjoyable.","Lincoln, California, USA","Oscbert"
4002,"2014-05-08",3.5,"Bottle,from Bottle Revolution. Good aroma, initial pine gives way to a earthy, citrusy scent. Ashy cola kind of dark malt, dark brownish orange color, good initial head faded to a solid foam cover, spotty lace. Sweet bitter flavor. Medium body, creamy viscous mouthfeel, bitter sweet finish. Good, like the initial pine I got, not as much a fan of the ashy earthy scent I got as it warmed. Nice mouthfeel. Its fine overall, maybe Im tiring of black IPAs.""...though my score doesnt seem to reflect that....","the Containment Area, North Carolina, USA","OldGrowth"
4002,"2014-05-08",3.7,"Cat pee, resin, coca cola aromas. Just a little roast malt laying over the resiny hops & caramel. Very dry in the mouth and finish. Fairly dark brown, with healthy kahaki head, but you can barely taste the darkness. I am not a CDA fan.","Portland, Oregon, USA","raphael"
4002,"2014-05-07",4.4,"Very dark, murky mahogany pour with a large fizzy off white head that dissipates. Roast and dank, resinous hops dominate the nose. Flavor: pungent papaya and mango build and subside a bit to give way to a dry coffee/roasty finish. Not too complex at all, but really focused, balanced and tasty.","brooklynzzzzz, New York, USA","hopwine"
4002,"2014-05-07",3.7,"In the words of Yoda, ""Black IPA lover, I am"". And this one hits the spot. 22oz bottle, shared with Shawn Y. Big thanks to DanielCoor for bringing me this. Nearly totally black color, clear brown red on the edges, kinda. Good thin khaki head, leaves good dots and bits of lace. Bottle is labeled 8.2%, which Im starting to think might be the perfect ABV for IPA. Its light enough to not impede drinkability, yet heavy enough for a big, assertive full flavor. Indeed, this is fantastically easy-drinking for the strength. Drinks like it could be 6 or 7%. Medium-plus body, super smooth lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Moderate bigger bitter taste, lightly spicy. Light sweet. Good earthy hop, light pine, hint of citrus. Something interesting about the malt profile that is especially noticeable up front, in the first couple sips... I get a little rye in this, but theres something else to it as well. Hint of coffee, good roast malt. Very nice, smooth, easy-drinking flavorful black IPA. Definitely satisfying.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
4002,"2014-05-07",3.9,"In the words of Yoda, ""Black IPA hater I am."" LIke this beer. Poured black with tan head. Nice hoppy roast blend scent. Roasted notes dont dominate hop flavor. Thick yet lively. Draft - Brick Store Pub - Decatur, GA","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","EricTeusink"
4002,"2014-05-06",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2015 This dark brown ale has an aroma of pine and pours with a thick creamy head. A bold flavor but not overpowering. Well done.

I must have been drunk or something when I wrote the first review. It is amazing. One of my a time favorites.","California, USA","BeerFunGuy"
4002,"2014-05-05",4.0,"Bottle. A black color with a rich creamy light brown head. A strong hoppy aroma with a cut of sweet malts. Smooth and well balanced with a nice bitter bite but otherwise rounded out well with a porter like finish. I am a fan of the style, and this one is quite good.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
4002,"2014-05-05",3.6,"Pours a clean and deep burnt wood brown that sits black in the glass. Two fingers of dense tight tan head. Hoppy aroma, best way to describe it. Nice and bright hoppy character. Some citrusy and floral notes fall in there too with a touch of woody-ness and dark grain. Lightly chocolaty notes in the flavor with citrusy notes backing everything up. Medium light body","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"

4002,"2014-05-02",4.0,"5/2/14. Draft at Bull McCabes. Pours dark red black with a nice creamy head. Classic Lagunitas hop aroma profile. Super smooth mouth (like a good stout) but not heavy. Dark chocolate roast notes balances the hops for a very well balanced drink. Not your ordinary Black ale.

4002,"2014-05-01",4.1,"This beer is awesome. Lagunitas really impresses me with sucks, Waldo, and this delicious blackish ipa. Super drinkable, light roast character, lots of tropical and fruity floral hop flavor. Very nice.

4002,"2014-05-01",3.9,"Tap at The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Resin/citrus aroma. Med + body. Flavor is citrus/resin hoppy, followed by bits of tropical and/or light stone fruits. All with a very darkish malt exhibiting a little chocolate. Its going lightly fruity sweet, quite hoppy, and pretty malty/bitter. I call complex on this tasty ale.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
4002,"2014-04-28",3.8,"Bomber Bottle. Pours black, citrus aroma. Taste is IPAish, not much backing body from the ""black"" - best noticed because the absence of the Lagunitas cloying sweet. Nice.","Washington, USA","HughConway"
4002,"2014-04-27",4.3,"Very nice Black IPA. Probably the best Ive tried so far. Ive tried several other black IPAs, and I just did not like any of them. In fact, I didnt even know NightTime is a Black IPA until I decided to submit this review. 

Anyways, for me, this beer came off with a nice aroma. It smelled like a nice West Coast IPA, but it was a bit faint and not over powering. So, I didnt think it was an IPA. I thought it was going to be an American Strong Ale with some nice aromatic hops. Then, we tasted it. It was like a weird blend of stout/porter and IPA. Finished clean without a lot of bitterness or aftertaste. Nor were there strong alcohol overtones one gets with more gutsier Lagunitas beers in the 9+ abv range (I believe Nighttime is around 8). Overall, it was a nicely balanced beer. My wife and I really liked it. Another home run from Lagunitas.","","mililani"
4002,"2014-04-27",3.4,"Bottle, pours brown with sporadic head and lace. Aroma is melon, onion, grapefruit, and dank resin. Taste is bitter hops, chocolate, rust, and roasty malts. Not nearly as impressive as the tropical hop smell. Body is light to medium. Finishes with a bitter smoked nut flavor. Average.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
