1839,"2015-09-02",3.8,"Bomber from Corti Bros. Pours translucent gold with a white head. Aroma of light malt with a hint of noble hop. Near full bodied. Flavor is grassy/spicy over a nice ""warming"" slightly roasty malt. Finishes bitter enough for me. Pretty tasty.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1839,"2015-08-01",3.7,"Bomber from Bom Dia in Noe Valley. Cloudy orange color with a lasting one finger white head. Malty bready grassy hop aroma. The flavor is liquid bread, mildly sweet and very balanced with a slightly bitter finish. Great mouthfeel, very crisp with medium body. Elite for the style.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
1839,"2015-05-04",3.5,"Rich copper coloured body with hints of golden tints and a bit of thin tan head. Aroma of light malt, a touch of hops, some unfinished sugars and a bit of grassy bite. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong herbal flavour with a nice and refined grassy bite with a subdued yet strong lager taste and feel. Aftertaste shows a light and rather deep malt presence with hints of oatmeal and grain, along with some light hops. Overall,a balanced beer with a nice taste overall and nice to sample with some thai food. I sampled this pint on draught at Pok Pok in Portland, Oregon on 03-May-2015 which coupled well with the Northern Thai food.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

Nose has honey up front, a nice grain bill very lightly mixed in with some floral hops. Taste is similar, lots of honey, herbal tea, grain, a hint of spice, sweet maltiness. Body is medium to full with a very assertive carbona tion and smooth silky feel.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

Toast and cereal. Palate: medium body, average carbonation, slick texture.

1839,"2014-07-18",4.1,"Bottle at home, picked up at Belmont Station in Portland. Pour is slightly hazy golden orange with a big frothy white head and great lacing. Big honey and melon characteristics - cracker malts, bread, doughy, and grassy aroma. Taste is clean and inviting - light citrus, dough, caramel, honey, grass, and melons with a crisp finish and lingering bready malt. Medium body with high carbonation. Really nice stuff.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
1839,"2014-07-03",2.9,"Bottle (April 14, 2014 bottling).

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, cracker), lightly hoppy (herbs, flowers), lightly yeasty (dough).

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy/velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Very little going on in the nose, and a bit too syrupy sweet for me. No flaws, but plain and simple.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1839,"2014-06-17",3.8,"Bomber from ABV. Pours a clear and bright orange color with a small white head. A sweet fruity nose, yeast. The flavor is crisp malts, honey, bitter hops, green leaf, a refreshing brew, but pretty big. Lots of crisp hops here, smoky. Toffee. Nice brew.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1839,"2014-06-04",4.4,"Pours a fantastic amber gold, with orange, copper and honey colored hues. perfect clarity and a small stream of bubbles coming up from the center. A beautiful head tops this beer. Cream colored and lasts well. Soft pillowy foam. The nose is rich malt. No hop character on the nose at all. Malty, honey and a depth that seems to extoll the very idea of sunshine. The taste is absurdly good. The malt is endless and resilient. Rich and deep but not heavy. It has a lovely sweetness on it like a warm breeze after a cold winter. The beer has a soft peach stone fruit quality in the drink. It tastes floral like sweet flower petals with only a touch of something bitter to accent it. Has a body that is decadently soft and creamy. Dry finish. its like eating beer cake.

Believe everything you have heard about this style. it is something I would love to have a lot more.","New York, USA","pinkie"
1839,"2014-06-03",3.6,"22 ounce bottle purchased at City Beer Store. The aroma has a ton of sweet cereal like maltiness. A dead ringer for honey-nut cheerios. Light grass hints, but heavy on the cereal malts. Transparent golden-orange body with a medium, light yellow head present. Fairly strong and persistent. Starts rather spritzy with live carbonation. Has plenty of husky cereal malt early and in the middle. Light sweetness is present with some toffee. Finishes with a fairly sharp, somewhat bitter herbal grassy bitterness. This is hopped pretty handily, but unlike their pils, it is not overhopped to the point where it dominates the malt.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
1839,"2014-06-02",3.9,"22oz bottle Pours a clean honey tinted darker golden with great bright tall lasting head. Low malt, heavier on the honey and mineral notes and faint sulfur quality...in a good way. Honey maltiness up front, minerality notes come in and a lightly sweet noble hop bitter finish. I dont have a ton of Heller Bocks under my belt, but as with just about all Heater Allen beers this is clean, well done and would happily drink more.","Washington, USA","bvc"
1839,"2014-05-28",3.6,"Bottle... Poured clear, pale yellow/golden with a thin head. Smooth, soft mouthfeel. Decent amount of malt sweetness with subtle earthy hop tones. Really easy drinking stuff.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
1839,"2014-05-26",3.5,"Bottle at Beer Mongers - Pours clear yellow / gold with a white head. The aroma has clean rich full bock lager malt, nice toastiness, rich, fresh undercooked bread, biscuit and granola - it smells nice, but can tell Im going to like the aroma more than the taste. It has a medium / bull rich body with fairly soft carbonation. The flavor starts off with lots of bread, heavy toasted malt and dryish caramel. The finish isnt quite as rich, but still super malty. This is good for the style, but really isnt my thing.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1839,"2014-05-24",3.8,"22 oz. bottle purchased at Beercraft. It pours a mostly clear rich golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is honey and malt with some light fruity apricot notes. Not much hop character. The flavor is more hop forward with a spicy, floral bouquet that continues into the bitter finish. Nice sweet honey and malt behind all that with a touch of alcohol. Higher than average carbonation gives this a nice prickly feeling on the palate in combination with the strong noble hops despite being a rather big beer with a full body. Its nice to see more of these German lagers being brewed with greater hop expression.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1839,"2014-05-06",3.3,"Bottle. Shared by our Portland visitor.

A: Clear copper, fluffy white head. 

N: Grain, earthy hops, and black peppercorn. Biscuit, cracker, and sugars. 

T: Very malty. Not quite enough balance for me.

M: SLick, a bit larger and oilier than expected. 

O: Doesnt seem to display Heater Allens usual deft, but it could fall on the style, too. Not my bag.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Clear golden amber with a thin white head.
Nose is malt forward, sugars, dark fruits, light spice.

1839,"2013-07-02",4.3,"Bottle. Lightly hazed honey-colored body with a tall, lasting fine white head. Beautiful in the glass!
Very faint nose overall, very quiet. Mostly honey / melanoidins, light floral presence, light peach fruitiness with some calcium carbonate minerality. Flavor is exceptionally rich and expressive honey, lemon, dandelion / flower petals with milder mineral accents (phosphorus, sulfur, calcium). Ridiculously soft malt with low, creamy carbonation. Medium sweetness, mild to medium bitterness, medium acid. Beautiful malt expression that is rare to find outside of Franconia. After the latest trip over there, I would even call this better than 95% of German heller bocks, and right now, I think its the best interpretation of the style made in the United States. Ridiculously appealing and endlessly drinkable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1839,"2013-06-09",3.9,"So still in love with this brewery...wish we got them in NorCal!  This beer pours exactly how a dank brew should look.  Golden hue, nice lacing, fluffy white head.  Aroma of caramel, white cake, and hints of lemongrass.  Flavors start rounded and malty reminiscent of the nose, and move into a glorious bitter grass finish.  Excellent.","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
1839,"2013-05-30",3.7,"Medium, ruddy  gold topped by a cream-colored dollop of foam.  While it remains light, the malt takes on a pound-cake drizzled with toffee and creamed honey aspect.  The honey note reminds me of meadowfoam due to its fresh, marshmallow-like aroma.  Lightly sweet, medium carb, with  a nice milky texture.  Mellow hopping comes across mostly herbal, but with a hint of fresh-cut grass in the finish.  Alcohol is decently well hidden for ~7%.  I have not been enamored with the previous bock output from Heater Allen ... that said, this one was more enjoyable than expected.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
1839,"2013-05-19",3.8,"22 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" in Salem Oregon.
$4.99
Pours a hazy orange( almost like a trad IPA) in colour..large thick frothy off white head.
Malty,caramel,toffee aromas..slightly boozy but not bad.
Thick caramel,cream flavours  also a little salty, very silky smooth and rich.
Great smooth as silk mouthfeel on this  like good quality chocolate..nice.
A nice rich beer for the end of spring. Gets better and better as it warms.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
1839,"2013-05-18",3.8,"On tap at Belmont Station. Colour...medium gold with an off white head. Nose...honey covered French bread with mat sirop and hop flowers. Palate...light CO2, a burst of clover honey  and locust flower and then a semi coating malt aspect that blends well with the mild hop bite and Arrow biscuit flavour. Id really enjoy  this one in the late summer and early fall. Zehr gut!","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
