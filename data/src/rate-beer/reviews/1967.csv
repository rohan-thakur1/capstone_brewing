1967,"2017-05-20",4.0,"This beer makes a good argument that a solid stout doesnt need barrel aging, coffee beans, or other ancillary affectations to stand out. It pours black as hell with an average head that fades quickly. The aroma is anise, strong herbal notes, some lemon and molasses. The flavor is really big, very dark roasted malts and some coriander atop everything in the aroma. Im still gonna seek out my barrel aged favorites, but stouts like Fade To Black Volume One are a great reminder that there are wonderful beers that never touch oak.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"

1967,"2017-04-27",3.8,"The beer sends forth a malty roast smell immediately upon popping the cap. It pours black with a very thin head, still putting out that alcohol smell.
Like many ""export"" beers, this runs stronger than the regular version, maybe at 8.5% it could be considered an Imperial stout. The alcohol warmth helps ease out the usual roastiness of a stout, letting slip in later in the glass. Without the smoothness left by bourbon barrel aging, this beer has to stand out on its own. And the roast and alcohol do a good job of that.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

The liquorice then comes through and it gains in spices trough into the aftertaste. A creaminess smooths away the spicier elements. Medium bodied.

1967,"2017-01-29",4.9,"The ingredients say this is wheat beer: water, malted barely, malted wheat, hops, & yeast. But they must have smoked it, because it goes down like a good German rauchbier, while being darker than any rauchbier I've ever had. The bouquet has notes of licorice, and it is dark as night.

1967,"2016-12-23",3.5,"Best by stamp on the bottom of the can 11/14/2017.
This was poured into a mini-snifter.
The appearance was a jet black pour and left the same color body. Moderate lacing appears after the head dissipates quickly. But even that lacing just slides right on into the beer.
The aroma exacts a nice super rich compounded roasty coffee bean up front. A moderate sweet espresso bean comes in and then some subtle vanilla bean. Light molasses is far underneath.
The flavor bends all of the previously mentioned aromas into each other for a mighty fine blend, sweet and roasty with a touch of blended in spice (must be the cardamom). Mainly a roasty aftertaste with a quick roasty finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with an ability to show some session, is the ABV too well hidden? Can says its supposed to sit at 8.5%, but the way this feels, Id say yes, I feel like I could crush it.
Overall, Id say the aroma and flavor was the best thing about this beer and very well done in those departments, but the feel, to me at least, I think with the canning date, I was expecting a little more ""beef to the body.""

1967,"2015-12-31",3.9,"The Foreign Extra Stout is a niche style thats close to traditional imperial stouts, but theres a finite difference between them. Id say Left Hand Fade to Black, Volume 1 is a good example of the style and I could tell it was a FES right away. Stylistically its on-point in all aspects, and as a beer its really tasty and nice to drink.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a wine glass. It had a best by date of 10/27/16 and cost $2.29 ($0.19 per ounce).

Appearance: Despite the name its actually a deep dark brownish red hue. Not completely opaque. Pours to a small, tan, foamy head which laces and retains fairly well.

Smell: Plenty of dark roasted malt as well as sweet confectionery notes of toffee, treacle and molasses. No alcohol presence.

Taste: A bit mild up front, but plenty of roasted malt flavor and dry coffee-like bitterness at the apex. The finish is the best part as it changes on a dime from bitter to sweet. Just like the aroma, the palette is pretty rich with toffee, treacle and molasses. It leaves an aftertaste of syrup, though the hops linger as well. I get some dank piney hop character throughout, which is nice. I would consider this to be a pretty well-balanced brew. 

Drinkability: At 8.5% ABV, Left Hand Fade to Black, Volume 1 is actually bit big for the style, though it seems much lighter than the average imperial stout. The alcohol never comes through in the aroma, taste or body. The mouthfeel is not quite the sticky sensation you might think; full-bodied for sure, but still quite crisp with a smooth finish. Not quite a liquid dessert, though Im sure itd pair well with your favorite chocolate or vanilla treat.

The aroma is really chocolaty, medium sweet, with a distinct odd spice note which the commercial description convinces me is cardamom. Its lightly woody with some mild coffee character. Pretty inviting honestly. 

The flavor is honestly pretty bitter and doesnt carry its self with the same richness as the aroma. Of course its got espresso, cocoa, plenty of roast, light smoke and licorice. Its boozy enough for sure & I dont mind the bitterness of it all, but something about it is just off balance a little.

1967,"2014-08-24",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 1-29-13-
 Served on tap in a pint glass. Not sure how they got this if it is retired, but never the less I thought I best give it a go as I am not sure I will have the chance to do so any time in the future.

Appearance  Served a pitch black colored beer with a one finger tan colored head. The head slowly over time to leave a nice level of lacing.

Smell  The aroma was heavy of dark chocolate and some bitter coffee. Mixed with these aromas was a small amount of smoke and a tiny amount of vanilla, giving an overall very roasty smell to the brew.

 Taste  The beer is on the drier side with only a lighter amount of sweetness. The taste begins with a good dose of roasted malt and a more bitter cocoa flavor up front. Notes of coffee and vanilla mix into the taste as the flavor profile advances with the beer getting even drier as the tastes moves on. Toward the end a light bitter earthy flavor as well as some smoke and a light alcohol taste join in, with the combination of all the flavors leaving a rather dry and roasted dark flavor to be left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on the average to slightly thicker side in terms of its creaminess with a carbonation level that was rather average. The slightly thicker body was good for all the darker and more bitter roasted flavors of the beer. A slightly thicker body and a tad less carbonation may have been slightly better for the flavors, but even with that said, overall the feel was quite nice.

 Overall  A rather tasty and dry stout with a nice dark and roasted flavor. The mainly dark and bitter body was balanced by just the right level of sweetness, making for a nice roasty brew.","","Darkmagus82"

Poured into a tulip. The color is definitely pretty close to black with a nice head. The nose brings quite a good amount of dry, roasty malt characteristic of the style. There is some light chocolate and coffee behind that. Roasted malt comes back after those diminish. The taste follows the pattern of the nose with a really strong roast presence. Takes of the feel is well, thats for sure. Drinks pretty well as everything comes together in the end. A good beer but not quite what I was expecting after all the hype.

The look: Brown black body topped by a medium tan head with good retention
In long: Nose is very roated with burnt cake, burnt wood and molasses.  Taste starts with black coffee, lots of fudge, chewing tobacco, whole-wheat bread and cocoa.  Then comes a surprising hefty dose of herbal hops and a little alcohol bite.  Alcohol is a bit too apparent for a 8.5% stout.  Nice Belgian-like lively mouthfeel.  The hopping character of the beer reminds me of a local beer Naufrageur Raccoon that I like because of that very reason.

Wheres the café because I smell fresh coffee brewing while my double shot of espresso slowly oozes its way into my carafe. Coffee may be my morning life-blood, but I could easily replace her with a solid coffee stout such as Fade To Black. Underneath her crunchy coffee and espresso nose are layers of chocolate graham crackers. Roasted espresso beans are coated in melted black chocolate for my snacking pleasure and that be all her nose wrote. Straight up coffee/espresso/black chocolate goodness and I am mighty fine with that. My first sup is dry, roasty, and of medium weight. Not too heavy, she glides across my palate just like a fine cup of joe should. Add some melted dark chocolates to the mix along with a side platter of chocolate graham crackers for dipping and I dont mind if I do. Easy drinking, she nonetheless is proud of her flavor profile which I am enjoying in spades. She only lightly dries my palate and for just a moment, dark pitted fruits flitter across my field of tasting.

Discovering this lurking in the back of the cellar I immediately decided to give it a try. I have been on a bit of a stout / porter kick recently and this fit the mood perfectly. I wish that this would come back again some day but in the meantime Ill look forward to what Left Hand has up their sleeves for 2010.

Aroma / Appearance - Thick and dense the head suffocates anything beneath. A murky black body soils the sides of the glass with sheets of dirty lacing. Heavy coffee notes combine with light smoke in a way that reminds of hiking boots which have recently dried out from a muddy trip. It could be a bit more complex but overall I like what is going on here.

Flavor / Palate - The heavy chocolate and coffee notes make this taste like a rich espresso. Sticky in the throat the chewy mouthfeel and texture give you plenty to ponder. I am reminded of Southern Tiers Choklat. This could be a little less one dimensional yet I still find it very robust.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Initial is fuller bodied, medium to heavier of medium, a potent booziness and roast hit the palate, bitter chocolate, a touch of smokiness sneaks in and really does something interesting, pretty bitter end, sweetness subdues behind. Smoke lends a touch toward ash and maybe even a touch of campfire, dry roast with caramel and cocoa sticking a bit.

Smells of super dark roasted malt with dark chocolate, coffee, and a hint of molasses and plum fruitiness.  The coffee and chocolate come through on the palate with the addition of anise.  There is really no sweetness whatsoever in this beer.  The alcohol is kept in check until the finish, where the heat lingers for quite a while.  The body is surprisingly light considering color and alcohol content, due to the lively carbonation.  It seems out of place.  The finish is long.  Overall, this is a solid beer, but the palate throws me off, and although the flavors are spot on, the out of balance alcohol is a negative.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

1967,"2010-02-21",4.0,"Sampled at 1702, Tucson December 2009
This arrives from the tap with a massive, almost four-finger thick, head that is light brown in color and leaves some pretty lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is quite dark in color, almost black, but it does have some brown hues to it.  The aroma is richly malty with roasted notes; it evokes thoughts of chocolate, coffee, toasted whole grain bread, toasted grain husks (that leans towards a toasted / roasted grassy note), hints of licorice and even a touch of sweet Bourbon and vanilla aromatics.

The taste is fairly sweet, which accentuates lots of chocolate flavors.  There is a firm roasted note in the finish that also provides to the overall bitterness, but doesnt quite balance the up front rich, malt sweetness.  The alcohol that is evident makes me thing of bourbon and vanilla flavors definitely are here, there also seems to be something like a spicy oak-quality as well.  Speakig of spiciness there seems to be a touch of something here that makes me think of chile peppers, but that might just be the influence of the garlic cheese bread that I just ate.  This has a nice creamy mouthfeel to it; this is definitely a rich and satisfying brew, though I wouldnt say it is cloying.  Hmm, there is a definite peppery note to this brew.

This is a very well balanced brew that surprised me.  It is quite tasty and definitely a great after meal type beer.  I like the spiciness and vanilla notes as these pair well with the rich Stout flavors.  The roast character is also well balanced by the up front malt sweetness.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Burnt sugar and heavy char along with a bit of lighter/softer fruitiness.  What I like about this is that it manages to get a lot of deep, dark complex aromatics in a beer that is fairly light and drinkable.  Soft wheaty texture and even though its 8%, it drinks a lot lighter than that.  As it warms the chocolate and treacle character comes to the fore.

It is just coffee like at first then it starts to overwhelm the palate with these big volatile flavors somethng like impy stout and such.

High alky impact is dizzying to the senses in big gulps.Not a whole lotta carbonation in there. Roasty carbonized wood seems to poke thru at times after each glug.

A thick and frothy head settles slowly to a thin but lasting blanket, leaving a dense, bubbly, sheety lace coating on the glass. The nose is really roasted, showing dark barley, bakers chocolate, and coffee, with a healthy quotient of earthen hops and toasty, bready, Belgian-esque yeast. Flavors mainly follow suit, rich, roasted, and bittersweet. Dark, dry cocoa and mocha make for the biggest component, just a touch of caramel bringing in a hint of sweetness. Earthy hops are staunch and potent, and the drying, foreign yeast falls right in line. Medium-full in body, the palate sports a prickly carbonation that gives way to a drying, somewhat ashy finish.

Appearance: Pours an appropriately black body with a fluffy, beige-colored head.

Smell: The nose starts quite dark and roasty with some humble chocolate and teeny notes of dark fruit doing their very best to temper the strongly burnt, creosote-soaked barley aroma.

Taste: Roasted, charred barley with some sweet layers of creamy, semi-sweet chocolate and dark caramel and unquestionably full-bodied coffee. Very small hint of carbonized dark fruits. Spicy, lightly earthy hops do what they can to counter the sweetness, but, really, thats already done with that deeply burnt black malt taste. Finishes dry with more than a fair share of well-roasted maltiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

It smells black, if that makes sense - oreo cookie, coffee, a bit of dark chocolate. Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some fruity notes.

1967,"2009-12-04",3.9,"12oz bottle. Pours deep black with ruby-brown highlights and a medium-thin tan head that fades quickly (though not completely - a thin tan ring remains and persists) and leaves subtle dots and legs of lace on the glass. The aroma has a wonderful buttered-toast-with-coffee sort of rich roastiness - like well-roasted freshly-ground coffee beans. There is a subtle hint of sweetness and cocoa in the aroma, too. The flavor starts roasty with subtle malt sweetness, bitter chocolate, light earthy hops, and hints of dark fruit. The fruity esters are not overwhelming, but are just noticeable enough that, combined with subtle roast acridity that almost tastes acidic/tart, give subtle impressions of raspberries near mid-palate. Mid-palate is roasty - almost burnt - with black coffee flavors and subtle toasty and chocolatey malt tones. The finish is dry and roasty with a balancing and firm earthy hop bitterness. Nearing the end of the glass, it tastes like Count Chocula cereal, but with coffee instead of milk. The mouthfeel is very roasty - almost acrid/ashy - with a nicely balanced level of bubbles and a medium-full body. There is a subtle astringency from the heavy roast that you can feel lightly coat the entire inside of the mouth -- not unpleasant, but rather hardy and bold like a Turkish coffee. Overall, a very decent export stout that is thick-thick-thick with roasted barley.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

The flavor found basically the same stuff, but with more black patent and coffee than other malts.. pine and coffee bitterness around, amplified by some boozage.. finished with lots of residual dark sugars and charred bitterness.

1967,"2009-11-25",2.5,"Eclipsed chestnut. Dying uneven ring of light-tan bubbles. Ashy, brown sugary nose with scents of scorched malt hulls, burnt cookies, cocoa, charcoal, cola, molasses and prune juice. Soft prickles of carbonation deposit a fuzzy residue on the palate. Harshly roasty and pungent with crunchy char reminiscent of burnt cookies. Suggestive notes of tarry java and smoke. Stiff black malt bite lends considerable acidity as well as some unpleasant phenols. Acidic and astringent, throughout, with very little texture, depth or softness to the grain. Underattenuated, limp and sugary, as well, with sloppy overstated notes of molasses and cola. No discernable malt softness or pale malt nuance to negate the sugariness. Closes acridly with an off-putting mixture of cola reduction, molasses and charred malt. Lots of conspicuous flaws here, namely the poorly cloaked alcohol, limpness of body, prickly carbonation, acridness, stark and unrefined malt character, etc. Down the drain.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Nose is nice with some dark chocolates, moderate roast, light burnt toast, hints of smoke, light notes of roasted walnut, and some light earthy/floral hops in the background.  The flavor is similar with similar hop notes being more prominent; bakers chocolate, roasted walnuts, hints of leather, moderate hop presence, and burnt toast.  The bitterness is moderately high both from the hops and the roasted notes.  Palate is moderately full, creamy, velvety, soft to lively, and just lightly drying.  Finishes fairly long and mostly bitter with strong roasts, burnt toast, and earthy/floral hops lingering.  From a style which I tend not to like, this one was quite nice.  Interesting addition of the ""kick-you-in-the-ass"" hops which was nice and balancing but still assertive.  The dryness was minimal and there were no chalky, ashy notes usually associated with foreign stouts.  Overall, a nice beer from an average brewery.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"
