3819,"2017-04-26",4.3,"bytemesis is love. My god, man....  Easily one of the slickest mouthfeel Ive experienced. Adds a uniquely tuned-in rice wine ""crunchiness"" to the palate. Astonishingly floral throughout. Lime zest peaks through as if its spying on his neighbors have sex. A pineapple-based sourdough character aligns itself as the Dom in the aforementioned neighbor scenario, masterfully taking no prisoners and having the titillatingly clad steamed peas, damp oak, and wheat grain viciously choke on his loaf before doughing in their pretty faces.  What I like about this beer is its indefinable cohesion. Everything makes sense, its all here for a reason. Nothing is mismatched or misplaced. Nothing is wasted. I like that. It just fills me up with this satisfying clingy warmth that for future reference is similar to eating chocolate, talking to a good friend on the phone, and watching Dexter all simultaneously while knowing that Im not Slavoj iek. Jesus fucking Christ. Do you know that feeling? No? Then try it sometime, you pathetic wanker.  If that doesnt leave you exhaustively happy, I dont know what will.  Under-ripe clementine is highly giggling as it modishly shows itself off to all the spectators watching from beyond the bleachers, a good 22 minutes of letting warm in the room temperature environment. White tea is creeping right underneath.
 It doesnt have that much flavor - its not terribly complex, is what I mean. What it lacks in a distinguishable multifaceted flavor profile more than makes up for it in its mouthfeel department, which is smooth and temporarily hard like an unfiltered Vermont well water source.  Graham flour at swallow? I never thought I would write those words but you can certainly expect that as well.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

3819,"2015-11-05",3.3,"Shared at a tasting hosted by Steve Hackley on September 25. Thanks Steve! This was poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a light orangey gold, quite hazy, with a small ring of head that falls off quickly. This seemed to pour pretty syrupy. The aroma is something else. There is an incredible heavy mint to this. There is a little more light citrus, some vinous grape skin, and a little funky spice. There is a little saison thats hiding in there. The flavor is not something Im too fond of. There is a lot of barrel to it, which is why its getting scored a little higher than I would normally do it. There is a lot of yeast and spice going on with a strong mint presence again. There isnt a resounding sourness, but its just lightly crisp. The mouth feel is thicker and syrupy. Its not at all what I would like to see from a sour or a saison. The aftertaste is a little bit like a cider, but the spice and funk I just cant get past.

Orange pour, modest head. Strongly herbal aroma dominates everything else going on the beer. Slightly sweet, a bit of lacto tartness, big flavor for 5.5%. Is this aged in gin barrels? It reminds me of Special Herbs, it has some juniper elements, and I certainly dont get any bourbon or cognac or rum. Could be wine barrels I guess.

Pours a restrained peach color with very small head of large white bubbles that fades to a gorgeous patina of large-bubbled lacing. Awesome look. Aroma is insanely good: juicy nectarine, peach, plum, mango, and white wine hit first, along with lambic-like bugs and hoppy/oaky earthiness reminiscent of mustier Cantillon bottles, then the whole thing opens up into subtle gin botanicals, spice, and lemon peel, with a faint tartness, like lemon juice and crushed berries. Taste is juicy while remaining crisp, with unripe sour peach and oaky Chablis mingling with doughy and crackery grains, fading into subtle pineapple, raspberry seed, lavender, and oak tannins. Vinous, lightly oily finish. Crazy mixture of complexity and drinkability, with perhaps a bit too much oakiness being the only drawback.

3819,"2014-06-30",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2014 effervescent hazy gold, half-inch large-bubbled white head drops to spotty lacing. Really rustic nose, tons of dusty hay and dirty wheat, high acidity contrasts with slick nose and tangerine phenols from the obvious brett influence, light lime in lactic acid. Front is all lime, huge lactic presence across the slick mid alongside light peach and rind, lightly eggy brett dominance emerging late with faint dusty hay, almost no grain across the finish. Delicate carbonation tickles palate, elevates the dryer elements wonderfully. The rustic start on the nose and in the deep finish are my favorite part, balanced and subtle throughout but a mish mash. 
[ Bottle ][ 1/3  of 75cl ][ Tasting ][ ][ Tulip ][ 11.29.14 ]Hazy orange, puffy white head dies quickly, lacing excellent. Lightly doughy perfume nose, still floral but more vanilla-oak soft. Odd contrast in flavor, lactic vanilla chardonnary battling with vegetal celery notes, salty with light florals mid, citrus still there, contrasted through the effervescent finish, lightly peppery. Botanicals rule this like rustica, more balance, ultra high attenuation but dischordant. 747414[ 11.28-29 Tasting Ranking ] 01. Saison DuPont  4.802. RR Temptation (b004)  4.803.

3819,"2014-05-22",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
White grapes and lactobacillus are found throughout this Wild Ales haystack, leading to classy citrus fruit lengths and much refreshment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the hazy pale orange.
-The flavor profile is superbly cohesive.
-The mouthfeel is lean and refined.
-The tiny bubbles contribute to this impression of refinement.
-This is not just another barrel-aged wild brew. Its not a work in progress either.

Nose is really just out of this world- it is the culmination of Uprights quest for a distinctive, delicate, farmhouse house yeast and it really shows. Fresh blossoms, yellow rose petals, juicy nectarine, mojito, flashes of fresh sourdough biscuit, touches of sweet cream butter prominent in Hill Farmstead saisons. As it warms there is an amazing fresh sourdough biscuit with orange marmalade that is just out of this world. Taste is perfectly refreshing- acidic but not sour, juicy with peach and pineapple. Tropical, but not sweet. Mojito like with lime and fresh delicate herbs. Mouthfeel is juicy, soft, quenching. As it warms, leathery white grapefruit rind piles on similar to world class Geuze like 3F Armand & Tommy. Perfect saison. Demands to be consumed in large gulps like a true farmyard refreshment. Same level as Hill Farmstead Ann. Doesnt even come across as the herbal medley that was normal Flora Rustica. This has softened up and become one of those transcendent saisons.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3819,"2013-08-20",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of ""hannont"". Colour...very light golden straw with a thick white head. Nose...eminently fruity with mostly citrus fruits coming through. Palate...very tangy with Country Time lemonade flavours as well as Gatorade original and diet cola. This beer has an interesting array of flavours but it all works well as far as my palate is concerned. Im curious to see how this beer ages.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
3819,"2013-08-03",3.9,"750 ml bottle from the brewery. Pours a somewhat hazy copper color with a large white head. A big nose of barnyard funk, light dandelion, woody. The flavor is excellent: big funky dusty notes, white wine, apricot, lighter suggestions of tartness but overall almost all funk from the bacteria, lemons, more oak, some vanilla comes in. Maybe Im crazy but I get some yoghurt (same bacteria). Nice brew.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
