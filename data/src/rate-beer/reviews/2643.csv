2643,"2009-05-04",1.9,"Bah.... questa proprio non mi è piaciuta per niente; scipitissima, che già la weizen normale non kristall era abbastanza sub-standard, questa poi è ancora peggio. In realtà me lhan spacciata per hefeweizen ma non aveva neanche un filo di torbidezza; nel bicchiere della Pilsner Urquell, allinizio, prima di annusare/assaggiare avevo immediatamente pensato mi avessero dato la pils... invece poi .. snifsnif... hm? ... gluglug .. è una weizen ma fa schifo ai maiali. Al Re Otan che però è un ottimo posto - birre a parte - e fanno da mangiare cose buonissime ed è anche un localetto carino.","Ronco Scrivia (GE), ITALY","LordCorkscrew"
