217,"2015-09-27",3.5,"Enjoyed September 27, 2015 in a pilsner glass bottled February 18, 2015

Look - Golden wheat body. Very thick white head with thick bubbles. Head doesnt dissipate quickly. Lacing is strong. There is a lot of carbonation from the bottom. 

Smell - Sweet malt. Grass. Light booze. 

Taste - Foam tastes like a Budweiser plant smells, very malty. Honey.

Feel - Very carbonated. Slightly thicker than water. 

Overall - Old bottle for style. Always happy to try a Floyds. Carbonated, honey Kolsch.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"
217,"2015-09-07",4.1,"Aroma is tangerines, fruit and slightly perfumed. The flavor is tangerines, fruit, mild hops, malts and a tart/very lightly bitter finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
217,"2015-08-28",3.7,"Bottle tasted at a hotel share in Athens, OH. Kind of hazy gold orange color. Pours with a bigger white head in my taster glass. Leaves good lace. Nice big floral citrusy hop, nice peppery character. Medium body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Mild dry finish. Very nice and smooth. Mild to moderate sweet taste, mild to moderate bitter, great balance to the taste. Good hop character, without being too hoppy or too bitter, for a kolsch. Yeah, this works great. A touch too peppery maybe, but aroma-hop does its job.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
217,"2015-08-28",3.5,"22 oz bottle at Bay month bottle share. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have sweet malts, fruity notes, a mild lingering bitterness to the finish, honey, a splash of citrus, apples, earth, interesting enough.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
217,"2015-06-28",3.7,"Bottle thanks to Ron. Aroma are honey, flowers, and light apple. Tastes like apple floral syrup. Light to moderate sweetness. Solid.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
217,"2015-06-20",3.6,"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 02/18/2015. Served in a stange/altbier glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a couple inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like grassy hops, bready and sweet malt, and some lemon. For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but with the addition of some floralness and a bit of honey. Nice amount of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a little coating and crisp with a good amount of carbonation. I thought this was an enjoyable brew, glad I got to try this one! $9.49 a bomber.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
217,"2015-06-19",3.3,"Bottle. Cloudy golden body with a frothy white head, slowly diminishing. Aroma of toasted grain, grass, dough, lemon. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly sweet and moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Light tartness in the finish followed by some lingering vinegar notes. Still, clean and crisp. Taste of lemon and some floral hops.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
217,"2015-06-08",3.4,"Can. Looks like liquid gold, perfectly clear, with a thin white head that fizzles to nothingness immediately. Aroma is clean, mild and lager-like -- corn, crackers, peppery hops. Flavor is equally clean and balanced, with nice noble hop character in perfect sync with crackery malts. Good balance; medium-light body. Very drinkable. The higher ABV isnt too noticeable in this kolsch; the balance and clean flavor of the style remain.","","PartyFowle"
217,"2015-06-04",3.4,"Aroma is hops, lemons, and macro malts. Taste is lemon, hops, and grassy malts.","","Dorkenstein"

A polished release between two world class brewers brings together the northern and central parts of Indiana in great fashion. A beer with a limited shelf life, this one is best consumed as soon as you buy the bottle. Heavy on the hops it highlights the past of what both have to offer the craft beer community.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze golden base glimmers with lively carbonation that unfolds waves of fresh hops. Caramels, orange polish, and lemons are heavy on the citrus. Starchy undertones set it apart although Im still not clear what would define an average ""doppelkolsch"".

Flavor / Palate - Starchy lemons meld with orange floor wax and a moderate bitterness. Part caramel and part hops, the two aspects play off each other. Sun King and Three Floyds might have been able to make something better but this demonstrates the expertise of both well. If it comes back around grab a bottle the next time you pass through Chicago.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
217,"2015-05-31",2.8,"22oz bomber. Pretty unimpressive for FFF. Classic golden tan body. Steady thin white head. Kind of buttery, harsh. Kind of like a big Pale Lager, with way better ingredients. Corny. Really not enjoyable, and not living up to any of the beers at a tasting.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
217,"2015-04-27",3.7,"22 ounce bottle. Slight perfume. Flora in taste. Some honey. Slight sweetness. Nice.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
217,"2015-04-21",3.4,"22 oz bottle from the brewpub (Munster, IN). Picked a couple ticks up on the last trip down as there was simply too much to try at once. Pours a well hazed golden hue, some lighter glow and colors show banana and lemon hues with a cakey bright white head atop, a sizable crown remains and laces well. Aromas are a mélange of sweet fruits, apple and pear meet honey and gentle citrus wafts that grow. Earth, bread dough, and a touch of earth as it settles down. Initial is medium bodied overall, a touch firmer with some sweetness, fruit and a bit of bitter soap meet bread dough, flaked wheat and earth. Apple, faint pineapple and honey quickly move to a more dry and bitter backend, the hops coming to the rescue to dry this puppy out a bit and get away from that fruity front end. This grows on me, jabs of lemon, earth and florals nipping away at this more girthy ABV brew. A touch dry and bitter as it tapers out. While this one certainly wasnt something I was looking forward to and the front end seems to lose me at first, the backend and finish redeem it. Solid.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
217,"2015-04-11",3.4,"Bottle shared by a friend. Clear yellow pour with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet malt, corn and light hop. Sweet and corny malt flavor with a light hop finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"

217,"2015-04-02",3.6,"22oz bomber from trade on HBT. Pours a hazy straw yellow color with a small fizzy white head. Aroma of fresh lemons, floral hops, light citrus, and a hint of mango. Taste has lots of lemon, followed by some bitter citrus zest, sweet grain, and grass. Really crisp and clean.","Forked River, New Jersey, USA","Ed5388"
217,"2015-03-28",3.4,"I had this one at Sun King unfortunately. Light pour, white head. Aroma is grassy, sweet, wheaty. Its crisp, clean, refreshing. A very sessionable beer and with 7.3% its also a beer I would recommend to session.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Block"
217,"2015-03-26",3.2,"Bomber from 3 Floyds brewpub pours a hazy light golden color with small fluffy white head and not much lacing. Aroma has honey, lemon, grass, and some yeast. Taste is on the sweet side with a bitter finish. Body is light to medium with slight carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel. This is not one of my favorite styles, but is one of the best of its style that Ive tried, with a lot more oomph (and ABV) than I expected in a Kolsch.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"

217,"2015-03-09",2.6,"Golden yellow. Fizzy. Aroma is sourdough bread, earthy, sweet pale lager malts. Taste is a touch sweet, malt forward. Watered down citrus I get from macro lagers. I guess for the style its what it should be and as good as it can be. But its a kolsch. And to me it tastes like coors light.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
217,"2015-03-07",3.4,"Draft to taster. Looks solid; a completely transparent golden orange with eggshell head. Smells and tastes malty with notes of caramel and mild lager yeast. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied and a bit crisp for the flavor profile; not bad though.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

Appearance: Pours a crystal clear pale gold with a minimal white head.
Taste: Malt with a sweet fruitiness. Low to moderate hop bitterness. White wines do cider notes at the finish.

Overall: Interesting Kölsch. Nicely balanced. Crisp and clean.","Indiana, USA","Jethro6191"
