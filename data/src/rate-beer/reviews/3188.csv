3188,"2017-03-24",4.0,"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 12/24/2016. Pours slightly hazy pale golden/straw color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, cracker, bread dough, biscuit, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, cracker, bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, bread dough, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and robustness of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/creamy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a great pale lager! All around great balance and robustness of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and well balanced; without being too bitter or drying. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding example of the style.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3188,"2016-08-14",2.6,"Can, best by 9/5/16: Hazy yellow. Quick and sloppy white foam forms a wispy halo. Soapy aroma, with notes of doughy yeast, lemon, DMS, wet paper, wax, applesauce. Graceless carbonation. Initially sweet with a lemon candy hoppiness trailed by relatively weighty maltiness which worsens as it takes on a white bread and wet paper dimension. Poor definition and minimal vividness to the excessively starchy grain. Quite soapy and muddled as well, with doughy yeast and DMS adding to the messy assortment of flavors. A waxiness akin to candy corn finds its way into the mix. Ongoing soapiness clashes with old grass clippings in the wet finish, which is further plagued by applesauce and Red Delicious apples. My first question is: wheres the snappiness? If this is lagered, its hard to tell. Its just a fuzzy and underattenuated mess of DMS and starchy malt. A very defective, misguided and unpleasant brew.  Another lackluster offering from this brewery.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3188,"2016-05-09",3.9,"This was poured into a pilsener glass. 
The appearance was a nice looking clear yellow color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly. Thin messy lacing shows some light rings of lacing. Carbonation could be seen rising at a moderate pace. 
The smell started off with some sweet citrus hops, then some grassy hops slide in underneath and then combine with a light biscuity maltiness.
The taste was basically the same with a light wet citrus to grassy to biscuity aftertaste. Smooth sweet, semi-crisp finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a mighty fine sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light. Light pilsener - like stickiness slides across my tongue. 
Overall, this was a pretty good semi-hoppy pilsener. At least for me, Id have again. And would love to have with some brats, bring on Suummer!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3188,"2015-07-19",3.7,"There are two prominent styles of pilsner: Czech and German. Though, according to the BJCP there is a third style: Classic American. Beers of this type are allowed to use adjuncts and pretty much any hops they want, but so few breweries actually make them. Cambridge Remain in Light is a good example of what can be done with the style as it has the basic makings of a pilsner, but uses different hops and a bit of rice to change it up a bit. It doesnt define or re-invent the style, however it does demonstrate what else can be done with it.

I poured a 12oz can into a pilsner glass. There was no freshness date and it cost $2.65 ($0.22 per ounce).

Appearance: Pale lemon skin yellow color; mostly clear body with light fogginess but carbonation is always clearly visible. Pours to a large, white, soapy head which laces and retains fairly well.

Smell: Spicy European hops are noticeable as it slight graham cracker sweetness; mild overall though.

Taste: A light spicy hop character right away. Not as intense as many Continental pilsners, though its not of modern American citrus or pine flavor. A bit of a graham cracker sweetness through the middle followed by a light lemony zest on the finish and sweetness in the aftertaste. The rice adjunct is not nearly as prominent as in macro brews, though it does give the palette a bit of a cereal taste. I like the hop selection (Styrian Goldings; Saaz and Hallertau); though I suspect either this is an old can or theyre used sparingly as this is not quite as intense as other pilsners (nor does it live up to the hoppy pilsner hyperbole on the label). This works fine as a standard pale lager or no-frills American pilsner. Approach it as such and you wont be disappointed.

Drinkability: The name  Remain in Light is both a pun and a marketing gimmick. Though I dont think any beer that comes in at 5% ABV can be considered light by anyone (sessionable is another story). This brew does have the light body and crisp mouthfeel you expect in want in a light beer (whatever that means). Refreshing while in the mouth and mostly clean aftertaste. It seems to be a little inefficient as it feels closer to a sub-4.5% weight. Cant the brewery drop it down to that without losing anything?

A truly fine American Pils.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3188,"2014-08-22",3.2,"Pale clear straw color. Full white head with varying size bubbles. Aroma is dough, hay and creamed corn. Flavor is much better. Clean and moderately dry with a bitter finish. Grain and white grapes. Pretty simple but balanced and enough hop bitterness to keep it refreshing. Good pale lager, but doesn't transcend the style.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
3188,"2014-08-10",3.4,"Pours gold into a shaker. Bright white head with little retention recedes to nothing. Sourdough and cracker aromas. Sweet caramel and sourdough front to back. Dry, abrupt finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
3188,"2014-07-24",3.6,"Pours a pale golden color with nice clarity and a finger of white fizzy foam. Nose is crisp and inviting with spicy cracker malts, stale grass, citrus peel. Palate is a bit more lively than expected. Big bright spicy yeast character mingles with the grassy earth hop qualities but the nice cracker malt backbone gets somewhat lost in the mix. Great session beer with lots of flavor but not my favorite.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

3188,"2014-01-17",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2015 On draught at the brewery a number of times and most recently at Lord Hobo 1/16/14Brilliant maize colored beer shows a high clarity and well-retained, plentiful white head.Saazy nose, is dusty, with dried grass, light bits of pepper and beautiful notes of spicy, succulent hallertauer. Moderate strength to the aroma, with light white bread and honeyed maltiness.Tons of hops up front; herbal, grassy and very pungent. The bitterness washes over the palate via the brisk carbonation and only on the clean finish do the goldings emerge, mixing with the soft, but somewhat deep, doughy/honeyish malts. The goldings evoke notes of Orval for me and make it that much more enjoyable.Ive kind of grown a little tired of the bone-dry session hop ales lately, be it Belgian or American or otherwise. While the lack of malt certainly lends to a light, refreshing beer, the hops are, well, still hops and even if they are lower alpha varietals, they definitely begin to fatigue the palate when there is no malt to soften them. Here, there is a perfect amount of maltiness, and it works wonders. Have had a few diacetyl notes in some of the beers, but that seems to happen sometimes when you dont have all winter to age these things on the yeast, which even then is no guarantee. Yada yada yada, wish I could drink this beer every day.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3188,"2012-10-09",3.9,"Clear, light yellow with white lacing. Musky, floral aroma; flavors of lemon peel, basement and yeast with a very light metallic overtone. Solid for the style.","Georgia, USA","DrinkEmUpJones"
3188,"2012-10-07",3.0,"Draft in a sampler at the brewpub. Pours a pale gold with a small white head that leaves some lace. Notes of straw, bread, pale malts, sugar, crackers, and citrus. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and a dry mouthfeel.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
