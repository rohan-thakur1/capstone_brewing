779,"2013-09-15",3.2,"Draft at taproom. Pours brown with a khaki head that leaves a ton of lacing. A bit of clove on the nose. Fairly flavorful on the tongue. Finishes clean. Solid!","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
779,"2013-06-04",3.9,"This 6.66% ABV brew poured up on tap at the brewpub exhibits a clear dark amber body supporting a tan head of foam. The aroma is sweet with prunes and raisins and some smooth banana notes. The taste delivers smooth sweet banana and prune like ester notes balanced nicely with a moderate pepper note and yeasty spices that seem to dry out the experience somewhat. It heads into a modestly dry finish. Nice balance and richness.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
