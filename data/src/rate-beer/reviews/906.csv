906,"2014-12-07",3.7,"500ml bottle, thanks to phaleslu. I received this bottle 2 days ago, with 1/4 of it gone, and the cap resealed. I was concerned about the condition of the bottle and doubtful itd be worth rating, but when I popped it open just now, a surprising amount of pressure was released from the bottle, this cap had an impressive seal... Who ever recapped this did a pretty good job. Im choosing to take notes here for my own record-keeping purposes... Totally hazy amber orange color, with a good finger of off-white head. Impressive-looking. Still quite carbonated, tastes like a fresh bottle. Im pretty shocked at how nicely this has held up. Leaves nice, thicker lace. Medium body, pretty full feel for the low ABV. Kind of fluffy. Mild caramel malt, doughy breadiness, light spiciness in the flavor, some fruity hops to it. Good balanced taste -- moderate bitter, moderate sweet. Really impressive, tasty, full-flavored, full-bodied stuff, especially for the low alcohol. Cant figure out what Im more impressed by -- the re-cap job, or the beer itself. Never had a 2+ day old beer that tasted this good, cant tell at all that this was opened already. Kind of mind-blowing for me, really, I thought for sure that this would be flat and unrateable... Impressive in how it drinks like a 5% beer. Doesnt seem to be lacking in any area. Kind of a mildly belgian-type pilsner aspect here. Dont mind it. Particularly impressive due to the ABV.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

How: Bottle 50cl.  Consumed fresh immediately upon reception through private importation
The look: Cloudy dark golden-orange body topped by a medium off-white head with good retention
In long: Kick-ass nose of horse saddle, pink grapefruits and haystack. Despite the low abv the smooth velvety body is far from watery.  This is not a bland neutral low abv beer, this beer is actually quite tasty.  Earthy fruits (citrus, pineapples, grapefruits), hay and straw, unsweetened caramel, dirt, chalk, dry grass, and a generous amount of spicy hops.  Overall rather dry and with a medium astringency.  A pleasant and totally fitting dirty countryside sensation.  Certainly one of the best (if not the best) below 4% beer Ive had.

906,"2009-01-27",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Fruit esters latch on to lean caramel malts, while spicy and citrusy hops converse with polite cereals in this quenching Steam Beer.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam slowly thins out over the misty amber gold.
-Is it me or the nose offers more cereals than the flavor profile?
-Bitterness is quite decent while remaining balanced with the rest of the flavors.
-Even though this is 3.5% abv, it never feels watery.
-That omnipresent fruitiness is akin to dried apricots, as the esters meld into the dextrins.
-The body is healthily svelte, with prickly but quiet carbonation.

With the beer being a contestant in the summer beer competition, limiting the ABV to 3.5%, I have to say I was a bit worried that it would be a thin and boring beer. I was wrong. It poured clear, copper-colored with an off-white head leaving nice lacings. Pine, citrus, both lemon and orange, malt and beef-stock on the nose. The flavor is quite balanced, with hops playing a major role, leaving the malt and beef-stock in the background. Full to medium body. My first beer from Amager, and a nice one I would say.

Its a scandal that this beer didnt win the summer beer competition - its impossible for me to understand how the brewer can put all that flavour into only 3,5% - and Im a real sucker for low ABW beers with a lot of flavour, not that there are many around :) The color is red-golden with a nice creamy head.
