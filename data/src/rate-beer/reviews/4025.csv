4025,"2016-12-06",4.1,"Bottle sent for review: ""Born on"" Oct. 17, tasted Oct. 21. What we have poured here is a very cloudy yellow beer, almost wit-like in body, under a puffy white head that dwindles away, leaving some sudsy legs around the rim. Pine resin predominated the smell, with some notes of tangerine and grapefruit in the background.
Theres no poetic way to say; the taste is a hop monster. bursting with pine and bitterness, and citrus. Sometimes, a green-hopped beer can get notes of grass or vegetation in it, but that does not show here at all. The difference must be that this was boiled with wet hops, but not dry-hopped. And despite that unfiltered haze, theres no yeast bite in the way either.
The whole effect is something like rubbing some fresh cones in your hands, getting those little yellow bits of lupulins all over, and taking a big sniff. In fact, thats pretty good therapy!","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
4025,"2016-12-03",3.9,"It pours a nice clear gold color, pretty light with an off white head. The aroma is very potent with the typical Lagunitas sweet hoppiness. Ruby red grapefruit, papaya, a little onion spice and just a touch of florals. The flavor is equally as potent with a drier, danker mouthfeel. A little onion and pine combine with the sweet fruity hops for nice balance.","","kambei70"

Dominate hop flavor, citrus, pine. Mouth feel is somewhat thin. Malts are there, but definitely under the strong hop flavor, aroma, and bittering. Bittering asserts in the middle and remains very, very strong in the aftertaste. A very good, hoppy, pale ale (in reality, an IPA, though, to be honest). The fresh hop aroma is there, and the hop flavor is there, but it is a very bitter beer. Not exactly my preferred taste profile, but not bad for a macro brewer! ;-)","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"

Rien de cette brasserie ne ma jusqualors déplu et cette bière ne fait pas exception à cette règle; bien au cintraire.

Pours a very slightly hazy dark golden color with nice cream colored head. Very fresh hop aroma on opening, not the most fragrant, but nice. My personal opinion. This is the best commercially available fresh hop offering on the market. I thought so last year and I think this year's version of born yesterday is even better. The green hops are upfront, the ABV of 7.0 makes me question the ability to call this a pale ale, but I ain't complaining. A wonderful offering that makes life worth living.

Well, it wasnt born yesterday, but they told me it was born in December when they filled the growler, so thats close enough. I was initially really excited by this, but the onion note just keeps growing and growing and growing The video on Lagunitas web site admits to Equinox, Mosaic, Amarillo, Simcoe, and Citra, but Im not sure which one is the onion/garlic culprit - usually its Summit, but that doesnt appear to be present in this one. Regardless, theres a definite onion/garlic character. Dont get me wrong, its still a world-class beer, but its not quite the paragon I initially thought it might be. (And can anyone explain to be how a 6.5%, 65-ish IBU pale qualifies as an APA and not an IPA? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?) (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Sticky hop oils, weed-like in flashes but always focused on fruity sweetness; mostly clean pale malts so this is generally not so sugary despite its sweet disposition. Punchy carbonation, somewhat top heavy in texture as it can seem both weighty and hollowed out at the same time. Somewhat extended, lavender candy finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Borned 10.27.14.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Lagunitas glass on 11.02.14.

A: I can smell from an arms length while pouring. Lots of grapefruit, pine, orange and mango. Hop resin is there too.

A: 1 finger head that is retained. See through orange body.

T: Grapefruit, green vegetable, orange, and mango. Mango and orange linger.

P: Crisp and bubbly. Nice carbonation that comes out on the back end.

O: It sold out at a local bottle shop in a day. I managed to scrounge some from another shop and then went back for the second delivery. Needless to say, it is an excellent fresh hop.","","WABeerFiend"
4025,"2014-12-30",4.2,"Thank you to my friend Derek for this generous gift. Pours a clear golden with a full, slowly settling white head. A very fresh aroma consists of floral hops pine, resin, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, and orange. Its very appealing. The taste has a good amount of bitterness with just a sweet touch. It has a solid combination of pine, orange and grapefruit up front. Additional impressions of peach, lemon, and apricot are found underneath. Lots of citrus hops in here. Sharp and short aftertaste is pineapple and orange. Medium body, with a slick, juicy texture, and plenty of carbonation. This is a first rate IPA here. Im not sure Ive found anything better than this from Lagunitas.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
4025,"2014-12-23",4.5,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy amber tinted gold with a foamy white head. Plenty of visible rising bubbles.
Aroma: Tangerine, grapefruit, resinous Jack Hererer. Pine.

Taste: Fresh orange/tangerine flesh and pith. Stone fruit, toasted malt followed by earthy bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, juicy. Carbonation is average for the style of beer.

Overall: First and foremost, this was a fantastic, fresh delicious beer that happens to be my favorite style of beer. The concept of a fresh hop beer being bottled and delivered in 24 hours is noble. However, I live in the land of hoppy beers (Southern California), where I have had beers that have rivaled the level of aroma and flavor. Im very happy Lagunitas is using their power and influence to teach the importance of protecting hop freshness and fresh beer as a whole. Lets hope other craft breweries take notice and not count on the masses not caring about this particular topic.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

Aroma is fresh hops, very fresh hops, super fresh hops and fruit! Taste is what makes this beer - its lightly carbonated and thin to medium. You can drink this all day! Thats something that is only possible by drinking this hop bomb a few days after its brewed. Similar to Stones Enjoy By but instead of a IIPA, this is a Pale Ale version. So much better than Dogtown PA - they ought to change the recipe and just sell this instead. Taste is fresh pine, lots of tropical and stone fruits, with zesty citrus, with a honey-like sweetness at the end. This is what Sierra Nevada PA wishes to be. Try this if you ever get a chance.

4025,"2014-11-16",4.1,"Draft. Very softly clouded tangerine, with a pillowy off-white head. The aroma is just incredible -- if I didnt know this was beer, Id swear it was a tropical drink made of fresh-squeezed juices, served on some temperate beach near the equator. Tangerine peel, mango, pineapple, cotton candy, honeysuckle, baked sugar cookies. Crazy-fresh, crazy-vibrant nose. The flavor has more of a citrusy bite, with sharp grapefruit peel and wet grass to go along with subtle juicyfruit tones. Bitterness is predictably substantial, tugging on the sides of the tongue. A touch of honey sweetness brings balance to the hop bomb, carrying into a clean finger-snap of a finish. As bright and vibrant as a fresh-hopped beer can possibly be. Superb.","","PartyFowle"
4025,"2014-11-15",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2015 Pours a bright clear orange with a one finger white head with nice lacing.

Has a medium body with a super creamy mouthfeel and a semi-moderately bitter, semi dry, long finish.

The aroma is very potent with the typical Lagunitas sweet hoppiness. Ruby red grapefruit, papaya, a little onion spice and just a touch of florals. The flavor is equally as potent with a drier, danker mouthfeel. A little onion and pine combine with the sweet fruity hops for nice balance.
