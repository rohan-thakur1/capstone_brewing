510,"2016-10-19",4.3,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Im not sure of the vintage, but it is probably 2012 or 2013. 
Aroma is very herbal and floral with yarrow and lavender. Light phenolic notes and citrus with a lemongrass character. Some coriander and grains of paradise. 
Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange with a small, thick white head that quickly recedes to the edges and disappears.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a great beer. Tons of floral and herbal notes with a bit of citrus. I really like this beer; Upright is criminally underrated. Herbal, floral and citrus notes are very gin like. Age hasnt really hurt this beer, though the flavor is a bit more muted.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

510,"2015-11-26",4.0,"Bottle in the dining room, shared by myself, you turkeys! 
Pours a nice golden color with a rise and fall head akin to macro lager, the beer features some prominent tiny bubbles, which is fine.

Goodness, Ive never smelled anything like this before, funk, lemon, peach, a bunch of pine, some very mild chalkboard eraser, berries, wow. Bright & complex for sure. 

The flavor is really interesting too, its just loaded with peach & white grape fruitiness. It starts with just a touch of sweetness but finishes very dry, its got some lemon, orange peel, some juniper, & some wood... its fairly sour and the acidity certainly lingers on the finish. Im astounded at how much of the Gin character comes through here though, Ive never had a Gin-Barrel-Aged anything that retained as much of the character of the spirit as this does. 

This bottle is nearly 2 years old by now, and maybe there was a higher herbal character when it was young, maybe it was more like a Gruit... but dam son if this isnt just fine right now.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
510,"2015-11-18",3.2,"Pours a hazy dark golden yellow color with a half finger white head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Spotty lacing left behind. 

Musty, earthy aroma with funky bugs and dry, earthy oak along with autumnal spice. juniper and gin barrel character faintly coming in. Brett and oak presence is strong with a decent amount of earthiness and musty funk. The gin barrel really stands out but Im not getting much peach or red wine character. 

On the lighter end of medium body with dry puckering funk and a very prominent brett presence countered by spicy ginger, sweet juniper and earthy barrel notes. Lots of dry oak and damp, earthy funk dominating the flavor. Again, Im picking up spices and wild yeast but not much peach or wine character. Very dry but has decent flavor especially from the wild yeast, light fruit and gin.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

510,"2015-04-27",4.9,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. I think this is a couple months old or so.

Appearance: Pours a translucent gold/amber with a very mild red hue to it. A finger of white head fades very quickly to nothing but a ring around the rim of the glass.

Smell: Wow. Big juniper berry, mild brett, cranberry, green apple, peach, ginger, white grapes. Lots of amazing floral notes - hard to describe them all. Fantastic. Who needs to drink this? I smelled it for a good 15 minutes before taking a sip.

Taste: Awesome. The aromas come through terrifically in the taste. Lots of sour berries and fruits: juniper, cranberry, grapes, lime, peach, ginger, green apple. A nice, mild amount of sour and brett. Quite dry finish. Very complex and delicious. Alcohol is all masked.

Mouth-feel: Low to medium carbonation (but definitely enough) with a light, dry body. Very crisp and dry.

Overall: I had high expectations for this as a big lover of gin and they were exceeded. I wish I could get this more often. I love the berry flavor additions to the more standard light gueuze-like qualities. The gin and wine barrels have made this beer absolutely outstanding. Very complex, very well balanced, and outlandishly refreshing and delicious.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","Resuin"

T - taste is bright tart citrus, especially lime. Some funkiness and a rolling sense if gin and tonic. Almost gueze like in its quality.

510,"2013-09-18",4.0,"75cl bottle shared at City Beer courtesy of deekyn - cheers Dustin my friend! Light gold pour with a bit of white froth. Aroma gives lots of interesting mandarin orange, light lemon juice, slightly sweet musty funk, serious gin and tonic notes (honestly), light herbal notes. Taste gives plenty of lovely light and zesty citrus, some light and musty funkiness, more G&T character, hints of lime and grapefruit. Lingering spritzy citrus and mellow gin notes, some lingering tart funkiness in there too, nothing major but enough to tickle the palate. Great little creation, this beer just screams 'summer' at me. Delighted to have tried it - cheers again Dustin.","London, ENGLAND","Beermack"
510,"2013-09-08",4.0,"Bottle shared at Collected Works tasting. Rosemary and lemony piney notes on the aroma, with the gin aspirating it into an almost pine sol character. Cedar, juniper and lemon verbena flavor notes, really smooth and round. Nice firm tartness.

510,"2013-08-27",4.0,"750mL bottle, purchased at BeerCraft. Pours like hazy peach juice; off-white head quickly vanishes. Beautiful herbal aroma with a lemony, funky core; an herbaceous midpoint between gin-and-juice and a mimosa; peachy funk and firmly tart expression; some really deft, unique stuff. Pulpy, moderate-fizzy carbonation, and a whole lot of lemon zest and gin-like herbal qualities; plus, theres sort of a juicy, pink-grapefruit wedge feel to it; even a light salinity; Im not sure Ive ever had a beer quite like this before, but I hope to again.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
510,"2013-08-27",4.5,"Wow! Aroma is awesome! Gin barrels definitely come through with beautiful citrus, floral, botanical, apple and spice overtones. Mouthfeel is perfect! Medium bodied, with prickly carbonation and mouthwatering, tart, dry finish. Someone mentioned a apple&cinnamon dessert and i get it!? Botanical/floral/citrus/apple/spice layers follow thru the finish. Savory saline qualities remind me of sea salt and caramel. Great balance! Soooooo good! So many layers. Even reminiscent of 'Sprite' soda mixed with Gin. A ton of flavor for 5.4%!

510,"2013-08-26",3.3,"750mL bottle, pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out notes of gin, various weird spices, a little bit of peaches, and oak. Flavour brings out loads of oak, white wine notes, a little cider, subtle peach, and some unidentifiable herbs in there. Quite acidic, oaky and vinous (from the gin). Couldnt drink a lot of this due to the acidity, but for a gruit ale, I dont see how this could be much better. Solid stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
510,"2013-08-19",4.5,"750mL thanks to GT2 via brainlair. Pour is a hazy golden to light amber. Small foam, barely laces. Aroma is baked apples, not acetaldehyde, more of a sweet cinnamon apple dessert, pie crust, honeysuckle, some buttery dough. Taste is honey, a touch sour, juicy with Brett C pineapple, peaches. Touch of sourness but not acetic or overpowering. Complex, but easy to drink. Meshes well together. Wooooo","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
510,"2013-08-19",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2013 750mL b2 (new Dr Doom label) thanks to brainlair. Major want for a long time! Pours full haze deep peach, a touch darker than expected but still orange in color. Medium white foam (poured very cold so head formation may have been minimized). Nose is quite juicy from the start- peach, sugar, tart ruby red grapefruit, something sweeter like a kriek with juicy black cherry. Taste is effervescent, dry, fairly tart with lime and peach at the front and more of a Hill Farmstead style sweet butter in the finish. Just a bit too buttery right now so will let this one warm up a bit and revisit.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~After warming up, there is still juicy peach and a lot more vibrant white wine barrel plus its latent funk, a bit footy if you will with the lacto. Then finally, there is that flash of the entire purpose of this beer, the Ransom Old Tom Gin barrel that comes through. Yellow rose is one of those components that is unique to Upright. More fresh botanicals pile on. Once it is room temperature, the sweet cream butter and fresh southern biscuit blend with the fresh Brett C pineapple, nectarines, and yellow rose pedals. The Gin barrel really is an incredible thing. In taste, it is progressively more lime pulp sour up front with unrripe nectarine. Juicy and refreshing. The finish though still holds a decent amount of buttery slickness either from the oak, chardonnay (?) wine barrel, or perhaps some sort of mild diacetyl. The tangy sour front with the buttery white wine finish is quite nice, though the butter wouldnt be missed. The sweet cream butter is a bit overtaken by saltwater eventually so maybe it wont bother too many others. I find the lactic back end to pile on with vanillin barrel and mild butter and some refreshing pineapple seltzer/effervescent. The sourness here is really dialed back, but ""peach sour"" would still be applicable to this beer. It is certainly delicious and possibly the most ambitious Upright beer to date.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
510,"2013-08-04",4.4,"Pours a thick, cloudy golden color, with a thick off-white head. Smells of a tart lemon and herb concoction, with the gin coming through. Taste is of a proper sour, with lemon peel and juniper as the primary flavors and a strong tartness following through. Smooth as silk on the tongue and slightly warm without being hot from the alcohol. All around a fantastic beer from a fantastic brewer.

510,"2012-04-22",4.1,"Bottle at the other nights Upright tasting. Served in a Mikasa tulip.

Bottle 132/166

Pours a sparkling, clear yellow color with an average, fizzy white head that diminishes fairly quickly into a thin collar with some sparse lacing on the sides of the glass.

The nose brings some delicate herbs with some gin in the background. A bit of citrus there as well. The flavor has a long duration with a very light sweetness plus a small dose of tartness. Light bitterness as well. Everything seems to be coming together, yet its all fairly subtle.

The body is light with high carbonation, leaving to a dry finish. Through the finish comes some additional gin and herb character plus a light burst of citrus.

A very interesting and delicious beer that I was glad to try. Heres hoping that Upright makes this one again.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

510,"2011-07-27",4.1,"750ml bottle. Yet another thanks to Todd for passing along this badboy. Bottle 107 of 166... Pours a semi to mostly hazy orangey lemny brown hue and crowned with a thin to medium fluffy white head... Aroma contains quite a bit of juniper gin botanicals and abundant to that degree. Tart semi-sour expression behind it all. Much more gin barrel forward than expected but totally cool and non-disarming especially from a person who is not the biggest gin fan... Flavors progress to more of a tart orangey citrus nature that they usually exemplify and then express more of the gin properties with the juniper slash pine qualities of the aforementioned alcohol. Body is light and extremely palatable. Hate to be abdomen record but this was quite a nice surprise although the barrel aged seven was enjoyed just a touch bit more.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
