Brandy comes through, soft and sweet, light fruity notes. Warm chocolate pudding into the finish, cocoa, roast, warming alcohol, wood. Lovely, if not a touch big.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
1821,"2017-01-28",3.8,"Bottle pours black with small beige head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is dark chocolate, wood, brandy, roast, dark fruit. Medium body, roast, cocoa, nice sweetness, wood, boozy finish, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"

As long as I have a designated driver we shall mosey on over to the brewery for a drink at the bar along with some of their awesome pub food÷","Norfolk, Alabama, USA","katseb"
1821,"2016-10-27",3.5,"Poured a darker brown with a beige head. Aroma was of dark fruits and chocolate. Flavor similar, brandy, dark fruits, neh.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
1821,"2016-10-15",4.5,"Pours opaque coffee brown with a serviceable tan head. Aroma features bourbon, roast malt, molasses and subtle woody notes. LOVE barrel-aged porters and stouts! Flavor beautifully echoes the aroma, only upping the woody component so you really get the barrel aging. Mouthfeel has good fizz and body. Roll out the barrel-aged beer!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1821,"2016-09-29",3.9,"Massachusetts rate number 400! 500ml bottle from Julios. Pours dark brown with a beige head. Aroma is dark chocolate, mild coffee. Hard to detect the brandy barrel. This is a touch thin, but nice and smooth with dark chocolate, mild coffee roast and just a hint of brandy and vanilla oak. If this had just a little more body and carbonation Id give it a 4.0.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
1821,"2016-09-29",3.9,"500 ml bottle shared by Willrunforbeer, for his 400th Massachusetts state rating! Deep, deep brown in color, no head. Aroma is deep roast, subtle chocolate, subtle Brandy, undertone of Portuguese port wine. 
The flavor really reminds me of a very old port wine I had many, many years ago in Portugal (year 2000). 
No hop profile is found here. The mouthfeel is a tad flat and maybe on the thin side but still... This is very solid but will say the barrel is on the moderate side and more like a brandy.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

1821,"2016-09-10",3.9,"From bottle. Pours a pitch black with a small tan head. Aroma has roasted malts, fruity brandy or cognac, vanilla, pretty hoppy, fairly weak, caramel. Taste is rather sweet, light, roasty bitter, oily barrel character. Light boozy finish despite a pretty light body. Average carbonation. Tasty and surprisingly light for the ABV.","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"

1821,"2016-08-15",3.6,"The base is a little to thin and light on roast for these sweet barrels. This one was unbalanced on the sweet side. Meh, its ok","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1821,"2016-08-05",3.8,"Draft at Meadhall. Pours black with a thin khaki head. Leaves trace lacing in the glass. Nice caramel notes on the nose. I haven't had a ton of brandy so I'm not quite sure what it's supposed to impart on the beer though the taste is quite pleasant as its full of dates and other dark fruits. Finished clean. Hides it's booze well. It's quite the easy sipper.

1821,"2016-06-30",4.3,"200th MA rating! Pours a near-black from a bottle. Caramel, raisin and oak aromas, throw in some chocolate, maybe a little hint of cola in the mouth. Amazing balance, very smooth, flavors have a hard to nail down progression that you want to focus on with every sip, but you still cant quite get it. Very good beer.","East Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA","Quick3Beers"
1821,"2016-06-29",3.9,"500ml bottle pours a black color with a bit of a head. Mildly sweet brandy flavors. Hop profile clashes a little with the brandy.","California, USA","Bule"
1821,"2016-05-16",4.1,"Bottle from Julios. Poured into a snifter. Jet black with a frothy tan head. Roasty aromas with a hint of brandy and oak. Flavor is very rich. Layers of coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak. Very smooth silky texture. Not overly sweet. Nicely balanced.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
1821,"2016-05-15",4.2,"Bottle from Colonial Spirits.
Dark brown with ruby at the edges and a smallish bubbly khaki head that dissipates quickly. Caramel and chocolate behind a huge vinous fruity aroma with a touch of oak. Tasty! Chocolate and toffee with a fruity vinous flavor melded to bits of warming alcohol and a faint earthy hopiness. Damn that is a tasty sipper right there.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
1821,"2016-05-12",3.9,"Draught at the brewery, 4/23/16.Fleeting tan head tops a dark ebony-mahogany liquid with light clarity on the edges.Tell-tale candy-like port barrel notes with sweet fig and prune. Gets more chocolatey, as the Framinghammers do, with growing vanilla and roast. Not terribly boozey relative to its size, with very little hop notes.The port gives this a much fruitier, vinous character as opposed to the spicy, more dry and woody bourbon barrel version. Still on the dry side, of course, with pleasant, moderate tannin adding body in concert with the malty texture. Low carbonation but appropriate, with little alcohol and no flaws. Excellent beers, the bourbon and brandy variants, and it definitely comes down to your preference of barrel treatment.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1821,"2016-04-27",3.6,"Pours mahogany tinged black into a shaker. Mocha head with good retention recedes leaving spider lacing. Sweet brandy aromas. Thick with chocolate and vanilla upfront turning to dry oak and brandy in the hot alcohol soaked pit fruit finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
