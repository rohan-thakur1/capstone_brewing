3863,"2017-06-17",4.3,"APPEARANCE- cloudy, super bright color and clearly unfiltered. Golden straw color. Head is pure white as the drive snow and has large bubbles. (I dont know what drives large vs small bubbles.)
NOSE- lightly resinous, and hints of tropical fruitiness. 
FLAVOR- lightly bodied, light hop flavor and light malt backbone to build on. 
NOTES-thoroughly drinkable! Great for a medium-hot Saturday afternoon in MA. Lighter beer than I expected from a brewery from the great white North, but it is an excellent brew and perfect for today. Well deserving of 100.","Lee, Massachusetts, USA","bnokk"

Big piney aroma with a nice citrus note, flavor settles in to a mixed citrus juice with tangerine and a hint of grapefruit, lots of resin but very well balanced. Doesn't hit you over the head but also not subtle with its hoppiness. Pretty good beer.

Dank floral hop aroma with earthy pine and resinous oils countered by sweet tropical/citrus fruit notes and a pale malt backbone. Grassy and earthy with pine sap, spruce tip and dank buds followed by grapefruit, pineapple, mango and orange peel sweetness. Subtle pale malt presence with bread, biscuit and cracker. 

On the fuller end of medium with a slightly creamy texture and some tight carbonation. Theres a very prominent dry, bitter hop presence that lingers over the sweeter notes, pale malt and boozy heat into a dry finish. Unfortunately, the hop profile isnt as strong or complex as the nose suggests. Lots of resinous, earthy bitterness up front but it falls off mid-palate and theres a lack of citrus/tropical fruit sweetness balancing things out. The malt presence is stronger than expected with strong biscuit and graham cracker flavor. This beer is only 7% but theres a lot of alcohol in the finish. Not really any heat, but theres a lot of boozy sweetness. 

Overall, this was a decent beer but the hop flavor is a bit weak and one dimensional. Theres also something slightly off about the mouthfeel. It looks and smells really good but the flavor doesnt like up to expectation.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

I couldnt place the aroma at all, my wife said it smells like peach or apricot... it was quite nice but didnt strike me as an IPA. There is subtle up-front hop flavor, but overall the flavor just dies after a few seconds. It didnt seem very complex and it didnt linger on my palate. I marked it down more because its not worth $8/ bottle in my mind.

3863,"2014-10-14",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 4-1-14-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a quite hazy orange color with a thick and billowy-cloudy white head. The head has a great level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a nice level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is big of a sweet citrus smell. The sweet citrus was a nice mix of a sweeter grapefruit aroma as well as a good showing of a tangerine sweetness. Some other lighter bready aromas were there as well with some nice smells of a tropical fruit nature of mango and pineapple mixed within. With some lighter grassy hop aromas rounding out the smell, the overall aroma ends up being quite fruity and sweet. 

 Taste  The taste begins much unlike the nose would have suggested. It begins very dry with a bit of a biscuit malt flavor mixed with a moderate showing of a grapefruit hop. There is a hint of a tangerine sweetness upfront that very quickly decays. Some light tastes of a grainy wheat flavor develop soon after the initial taste with some more hop flavors of a grassy nature later coming to the tongue. While this occurs so too does the biscuit transition to a more cracker like flavor, with an even drier flavor overall. With more grapefruit hop and some light herbal flavors coming to the tongue at the very end, a very crisp and dry hopped taste is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. Both are rather nice for blending the hop flavors with the moderate malt and fruit profile all while complementing well the very crisp taste of the brew. 

 Overall  A rather tasty, crisp, and dry, but nicely hopped and still somewhat balanced IPA. Overall a quite enjoyable brew.","","Darkmagus82"

3863,"2014-07-06",4.5,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 6/24/14 and cost $7.99 ($0.47 per ounce).

Appearance: Lemon-skin yellow hue over a very hazy body, though carbonation can be seen streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Pours to a large, gleaming white, fluffy head with leaves thick rings of lacing around the glass and maintains a consistent layer on top of the beer.

Smell: The epitome of the New England IPA style with a pungent nose of tropical fruit and herbal/earthy characteristics. Very enticing. 

Taste: We here in the Northeast have been lucky to get so many great IPAs coming out of the New England states in the last few years. Theres a commonality to them as far as aroma and tastes goes, though the one thing they have in common is theyre delicious beers. Maine Beer Companys Another One lives up to its name: another one in a long line of great IPAs. Nothing wrong with that.

This beer definitely follows the path blazed by Heady Topper and many brews of the style. Theres a light maltiness with notes of honey, but otherwise the hops dominate. A delectable delivery of tropical and stone fruit right off the rip: pineapple, mango, passion fruit, pomegranate, etc. Not citrusy per se, though. Theres an underlying spiciness which becomes very apparent on the second half. Notes of basil, pesto or oregano can be found here. Its definitely bitter, but not aggressively so. Just the right amount of IBUs to wow the palate without ruining it. My only complaint would be the maltiness is just a tad underplayed, but its still strong enough to stand up to the hops.

Drinkability: What makes great beers great aside from their taste is when theyre actually highly drinkable. At 7% ABV, Another One isnt quite a behemoth, though its far from a session beer. The mouthfeel is rather soft with an almost creamy-like texture, with consistent crispness throughout. Refreshing for a moment, though theres a slightly starchy aftertaste, but the hops arent saturating or obnoxious in their stay. Its very tempting to throw back several pints of these.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

I certainly hope not. It does smell like Weez, too much yeast stink, b vitamins, aspirin, that sort of thing, though there is some redeeming fruitiness; cherries, grapefruit, candied orange. Just too aggressively acidic and yeasty. Thankfully, the alcohol is controlled, or at least so far, Im only at about lightly chilled in temeperature. No telling where well be once it warms fully.Not nearly as bitter and acidic as expected. Actually just a caramelly-IPA with nice touches of cascade orange, grapefruit and earthy/leafy greens. Perfect mouthfeel, as always. Man these guys know how to bottle a motherfu**in beer! Incredibly tight, engaging, natural carbonation and in concert with the perfect attenuation, it really makes up for a lot. Not that theres much to make up for because the hop flavors are deliciously citric, flavorful and lacking in pine and resin. The rare example of the IPA being much better in flavor than aroma, but Im ok with it. Much rather have it that way. Just a slight amount of bitterness on the end, mixing with the carbonation and its just heaven. I can see where this beer gets its ratings. If we could just relax on all of that vitamin-like aroma, this would be one of the best beers around. As is, its damned good and really drinkable (I dont put that much stock in aroma).  I like Sr. Silligooses suggestion that it could be lower in abv, not that 7 is obnoxious, but theres no reason why all of their beers need to be this high.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3863,"2014-02-06",3.9,"Received in trade. Reviewed from notes. Consumed Feb 06.
The appearance had a nice light golden yellow-colored body with a carbonation seen rising at a moderate pace. One and a half fingered white foamy head that dies within a half minute, nice adequate spider web lacing sticks to the glass.
The smell started off a strong citrus but bitter hoppiness coming forward through some nice sweet malts.
The taste was bittersweet all the way through with more of a pronounced sweet grapefruit flavoring to it. It had a nice sweet citrus aftertaste and a dry bittersweet finish.
The palate about a light to medium, somewhat sessionable for a 7.2 ABV - I like it. Carbonation hits ya like a good AIPA should - nice and harsh.

A: Pours a solid orange color with a thick and bubbly white head that is the norm for Maine Beer Co beers. Sticky clumps of lace are left down teh glass.

S: A ton of juicy citrus and tropical fruits. Lots of mango and orange with some papaya and light pineapple. Light malt sweetness, but the hops are the star of the show in the nose.

T: Not as vibrant as the nose. The cracker malts are a little more upfront with some nice sweetness. Still has that nice citrus backing with a little hint of bitterness like a orange peel. A little orange pith as well.

M: Light bodied with a medium high carbonation level. Finish is slightly fruity and sweet.

O: The nose was an outstanding burst of hops, but I felt the malts took over a little much in the taste. A little balance towards the hops would have been exquisite and would make this a much better beer. That being said Id drink this any day of the week and especially during this hot Summer.

Maine Beer Company make sure that the Hops are the showcase of their ales. Also M.B.C. is good at hiding their alcohol in all their IPAs. Like I said before about Hops. If you have a Hop Tooth, this is the brewery for you. The two things I have against M.B.C. (my opinion anyway), is the price tag and the mouth feel on their brews that Ive had so far.

3863,"2013-08-20",3.4,"500mL Bottle, purchased at Wakefield Liquors - Wakefield, RI. Flint, plastic, and high alpha madness a la Mosaic/Citra/etc. Not loving it. Cleaner body, but still laden with papaya seeds and wet rocks. I didnt realize at first that this was a pairing with Weez, so I popped my bottle of Weez, and oh boy is this ever a testament to making pale IPAs. Weez is just a hoppy stout, but I can pull hop varietal characters out of this. Yet, this doesnt hold up to my candle of Maine Beer Co work that is Peeper and Lunch.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3863,"2013-08-14",4.0,"Bottle [500ml] shared with and courtesy of HogTownHarry. Pours a cloudy yellow-gold with a large lasting frothy off-white head.

Great hoppy flavour, resiny, floral and citrusy, along with tropical fruit and backed by sweet malt, spices and a long dry bitter finish. Medium bodied. Great stuff, I really liked this.

Aroma is quite floral and bitter with lemon zest and some alcohol - not sweet at all, quite dry. Taste follows, more intense bitterness with some citrus juice malt joining, quite balanced, not boozy but the 7% is definitely there. Average body, solid carbonation, a little acidic with only medium-long dry bitter floral finish, tropical fruit overtones.

3863,"2013-06-23",3.7,"Bottled June 11, 2013.
Appearance: The body is hazy, though I can probably place the blame on that for me since it was only in the fridge upright for a few hours. I should have waited until tomorrow. The color is beautiful though with a golden to amber body. The head is tall and white with decent retention, leaving a little lacing and a thin coating.
Aroma: The aroma has a strong mango presence with pineapple, very tropical. Floral notes are light with sweet oranges coming through a bit stronger.
Taste: Much like Weez, the base is a bit thin, though the hops shine here. Lots of orange, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit, but theres not much backing it. Shame.
Palate: Creamy body, almost smoothie like, with soft carbonation.
Overall: This is a good beer, but like Weez it is lacking body. Much like the other beers they produce this is also a poor value and I wouldnt buy it again.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
