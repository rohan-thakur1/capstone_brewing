Fluffy brown head. Dark red-brown color. Sweet malty aroma. Fine caramell taste that is well fermented to give just a tiny residual sweeetness. Light and still balanced with a impressive taste.

1242,"2015-04-21",3.3,"Flasche (50 cl) von Getränke Frizzz, Regensburg. - Tiefstes Kastanienbraun, klar (soweit erkennbar). - In der Nase schwarzer Kaffee, Pflaume, leicht weinige Noten, dicht aber vornehm und keinesfalls fuselig. - Antrunk gediegen röstmalzig mit (wenig) Rohrzucker, Pflaumenmus und einem Touch spritziger Säure. Für einen Doppelbock gut rezent - etwas weniger Kohlensäure würde ihm guttun. Im Abgang mehr füllige Malzsüße und mild krautige Herbe, die gerade ausreicht, um die Malzfülle zu grundieren. Den Alkohol schmeckt man kaum. - Schöner Doppelbock, sehr rund und gediegen, weder breit noch fuselig; für einen Doppelbock beinahe schlank. Gelungen.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"
1242,"2014-10-17",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Candied dark fruit, molasses and caramel lead to earthy hops and toasted sugars in this rich Doppelbock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the hazy dark brown.
-Alcohol is well hidden throughout.
-Carbonation, in the tap version, was a bit too much for the style, imho.
-The bottle proved to be more polished and totally world-class within its category. Above rating is an average of both tap and bottle experiences.

On tap at the brewery and from the bottle.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Im Antrunk ist das Bier schön süffig-angenehm süßlich. Zum Hauptteil entfaltet sich eine schöne malzige Note. Schon etwas ins Röstmalzig gehende. Dabei angenehm süß und nicht zu klebrig. Keinerlei alkoholische Note spürbar. Der Nachgeschmack wird sogar noch röstmalziger - es bleibt eine schön verbrannte Brotkrustennote im Mund. Oder auch schönes dunkles Schwarzbrot sehr gelungen! Erst ganz zum Ende hin wird es etwas klebriger. Aber nicht besonders stören!

1242,"2013-05-09",5.0,"My 2nd, Palmator Dunkler Doppelbock, from Prösselbräu Adlersberg.

Yep, the color is pitch black... aint no light gettin through this puppy... under a tan head with large light bubbles that last longer than I wished... shouldnt have made such a strong pour. ABV = 7.4% printed on my bottle.

The aroma has plums, dates, sweet caramel, as if they were cooked all into a sauce! This smells almost like a Belgium trippel. Lets see if the flavor matches the wonderful aroma. The front has a decent amount of tartness and the sides give you some of the same flavor or plums, dates and sweet carmel, but also a little bitterness, not much, but its noticeable if you try to find it. Then in the back its sweet caramels but in a burnt, molasses kind of way. Yes, its like motor oil, not as thick and chewy as Paxs Lakritz Oatmeal Stout, but the chewiest German brew Ive had other than that. I love how it sits on the tongue and glides over it, going from tart, to plum/dates sweet to burnt, roasted flavors that I usually associate with sweet Stout. It still tastes like German malts, though, and doesnt feel like a British brew, yet it has some of the same quality without the esters and fruitiness of a London Ale yeast. Im not sure that make sense, does it? The aftertaste is that same plum/dates/caramel mix flavor with Vienna or Münchener malt flavor thrown in as a teaser, just at the end. The only real drawback I feel is that you can taste the hotness of the alcohol. Being filtered and sitting in my cellar for 2 months should have helped that dissipate, but its only something I noticed on the first few sips, after which it disappeared.

Overall, this is close to a WOW beer. Except for the hotness of the alcohol you can taste, its a great beer.","Frankfurt, Hesse, GERMANY","boddhitree"

1242,"2011-01-10",3.0,"Meglepően szép színe van: sötét, alig-alig áttetsző meggypiros folyadék. Illata savankás, élesztős, nem éppen lehengerlő. Habja nehezen támad, de sűrű lesz és lassan múlik.
A szájüregben nem okoz heves élményeket. Alacsony karbonációja, és tejszerű állaga könnyű testtel párosul. Ha ez nem igazán szimpatikus, akkor ott van még az íze.
Nyilván a karamellmalátával való játszadozás eredményeképpen lesz tejeskávé íze, ami azért fejlődik, inkább kávélikőr, és amikor kifejlődik, leginkább a Bayleys-re hasonlít. Mindeközben valami olcsó cukrosságot is érzek benne  persze lehet, hogy ez is csak a Bayleys szériatartozéka.
