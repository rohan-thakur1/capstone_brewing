3715,"2012-07-24",4.6,"Man, LOVE beers like this! Served with a huge, foamy, frothy, sudsy, tan head that slowly subsides to a light cover which lasts alllll the way down and lots of clingy lace. Color is a slightly hazy, dusky amber red. Aroma is very malty, a hint of roast, fruit, toffee, and biscuit. Flavors like nose and has a killer combination of sweet, carbonic tang, fruit and bitter from hop, and hint of roasty dry at the end that makes this stuff dangerously tasty. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is of average length, and like I say, eminently drinkable.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
