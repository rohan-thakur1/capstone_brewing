3312,"2008-08-11",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2017 My Bottom Line:
Vibrant grassy noble hops protrude from the pils malt haystack promoting compelling bitterness and meticulous sweetness for an überquenching Zwickelbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam decorates the hazy blond.
-This is balanced, flavorful and ever-so-drinkable. I want to go back to Franconia so bad!!
-The mouthfeel was light and soft, yet never frail.
-Some honeyed sweetness was also found, as well as faint banana esters.
-This one was able to stand shoulder to shoulder quality-wise with Birrificio Italianos remarkable Tipopils. I even had to order a second pint of each just to make sure. ;)
