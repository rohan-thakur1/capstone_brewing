3902,"2017-04-22",3.7,"Danish pint from a 12 oz. bottle; from Old Town. Aroma: Rich, slightly earthy, sweet and tart raspberry with tartness coming out considerably. Appearance: Unfiltered raspberry pinkish red with a bubbly off-pink head that settles into a very thin ring.

3902,"2017-02-20",4.2,"11.5 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/6/2016. Pours fairly murky deep ruby red light pink/purple color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge tart/sour/tangy raspberry, lemon, lime, green apple, red grape, wheat, and cracker; with light lacto funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of raspberries, fruity/acidic yeast, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart/sour/tangy raspberry, lemon, lime, green apple, red grape, wheat, and cracker; with light lacto funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Moderate fruity/lactic sourness and tannic fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour/tangy raspberry, lemon, lime, green apple, red grape, wheat, and cracker; with light lacto funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of raspberries, fruity/acidic yeast, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a nice malt/tart/sourness balance; lightly puckering, but not astringent. Moderate dryness from acidity/tannin, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, acidic/tannic, fairly crisp, and lightly grainy/creamy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.9%. Overall this is an outstanding fruited Berliner weisse! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of raspberries, fruity/acidic yeast, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing too drink; even with the fairly strong acidity/sourness. Flavors were not as strong on the raspberries as the aromas led me to believe, but still had a nice amount of fruit presence. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3902,"2017-02-16",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2017 (341ml bottle from phyllomedusa) Pours a lightly hazed pale fuchsia colour with a small off white ring of stable bubbles and spotty lace. Aroma of seriously juicy fresh raspberry flesh with just a little jam, very intense, hints of other tart berries (red currant?), sweet backing notes, kind of candied, subtle lactic tartness, maybe a little wheat. Flavour is fairly deep raspberry flesh (a touch like blackcaps) and seeds, rather tart but very dry and mineral, rose hips, dried flowers and stems, light grain, a little lemony lacto. Finish retains persistent dryness and light berries, but also a moderate lactic note that lasts for a full minute after swallowing. Body is light to medium with a soft but effervescent carbonation. The nose on this is bonkers for the depth of raspberry that few similar beers equal, while the flavour is quite different but still rather unique for style. Cool stuff.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

With a foamy pink head that disappeared quickly. Nose is chock full of berries (which masks pretty much everything else). Mouth is dry, light bodied, crisp, moderately tart, berries, hint of bread. Would be perfect if it was 98 degrees outside. However, it is about halfway there (49) in Chicago, in early February, so I cant complain too much.

I am not a fan of fruit infused beers so I find myself unexpectedly intrigued by this. Has a nose of tart red fruit and pucker if thats possible, and an earthy going to musty fruit decaying type of nose I cant quite place, but it reminds me of being beneath my grandfathers trellis with rotting grapes and raspberries as a child. Something else going on as well like cough drops or menthol. The palate is astringent, fresh and clean but acidic and bitter. Could see me drinking this on a summer day. This is NOT my style of beer, but Im enjoying more than I thought I could.","","laminarman"

Marqué de citron et de framboises, lolfactif nous rappelles lacidité de la framboise en début de période de cueillette. avant quelle ne devienne sucrée. Un olfactif puissant mais unidimensionnel.
Le visuel est rosé / rouge, très flou, avec une mousse rose de bonne épaisseur, de bonne densité, ainsi que dun maintient assez long. Elle laisse de légères traces sur le verre.
Lacidité frappe les cotés de la langue dès lentrée de bouche et sinstalle pour laisser place à la framboise immature qui sinstalle en douce saveurs citronnées avec une touche de salé. Leffervescence est très active, ce qui rend ce liquide très rafraichissant. La texture est moyenne et léquilibre acidité / fruit est intéressant. Aux amateurs dacidité tranchante.

In long: This is a tasty beer that brings an interesting mix of raspberries acidity and cherries sourness.  I even asked the owner whether there was cherries in there but no, only raspberries.  The finish is sour and acidic.  Like other good raspberry beers this is not a complex beer but when done right it kicks some serious ass.  And this one does.

3902,"2005-07-18",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2015 On draught at DdC, RBSG, 7/9/2005.  Bright pink colored body, with a pink and yellow tinged white head, very creamy.  Head is well retained, though it is quite small.  However, it leaves long, whispy strands of lace as it recedes down the glass.  The aroma has a slight dullness/heaviness from the soaked wheat notes.  Hints of creamy wheat porridge, with milk and light vanilla.  Sour yeast can be noted, though it is not nearly as expressive in the nose as in the flavor.  The raspberries are liberally done, yet nothing artificial or cheap here.  Raspberry skins, seeds and pulp all integrated and mostly dry.  Flavor begins with a heavy wheat and water texture, but some vanilla, light fruit sugars and then finally, the sourness peaks in.  It is, ultimately, quite manageable and not as acidic as I was expecting/hoping.  But still quite pleasing and very fresh tasting.  A few people were saying that the beer tasted less lively and more dulled than they had remembered in past weeks, with the possibility that we had been getting the bottom of the keg (hence the heavier wheat and duller yeast blandness).  But Im not sure.  Carbonation is moderate and adds a sparkling texture in the middle, which helps break up the thickness.  Light vanilla and raspberry juice, with a pleasing lactic note that starts to build up on the back of the throat.  A touch of wood pulpiness too.  I really like the way the fruit is done but I would like to see more sourness.  Hope to revisit again soon.  7/5/7/3/142015 bottle drunk 7/26/15A much needed update here and reading my old rating, I think I was in a midst of ""everything must be super sour"" kick.  Wrong.  This is plenty sour and regardless, the raspberries are just pure bliss here.  Dont know if I was accurate with the previous beer I had being ""thick"" but I see none of that here (nor really know what the hell I was talking about).  Anyhow, this was fantastic with both good fruit AND berliner character; wheat dryness, tart/sour lactic notes and good attenuation and carbonation.  Yum.  Rating is for this sample.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3902,"2005-07-18",4.1,"Glass at the brewpub, RBSG Montreal.  Bright cranberry red with a lasting pink head, quite clear but a touch oily-looking...gorgeous fruity sweet-tart nose with vanilla and light wheaty malt undercurrents...body very, very dry and clean with loads of fresh though barely ripe and sugar-deprived fruit, light thyme and other dryish seasonings...finish clean, very dry, sour, a knifelike attack on the palate that succeeds admirably.  Best beer that was new for me at DDC last weekend, awesome.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3902,"2005-07-13",3.8,"Bright glowing ruby red color with a clear body and a white head.  The smell is distinctly candy-like: sugary jolly rancher candies, not really giving off any real fruit or wheat vibe, but the flavor is something completely different.  Robust, semi-sweet deep raspberries with a good, solid sour quality and a crisp bite to finish it off.  Lambic-like, with a somewhat watery body.  A highlight of my DDC visit.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

For some reason this does not wholly work for me -- first time I have had a Berliner Weisse accompanied by fruit.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
3902,"2005-07-13",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2009 No notes, re-rate. Wow. This was just about perfect. Bumping the overall up to 4.0. Deliciously refreshing. 

RBSG 2005. Ruby Kool-Aid hue with a small pink head that resists resuscitation. Very tart fruity raspberry aroma, mild glimpses of acidity. Very tart, moderately acidic flavour is restraint enough to all the fruit to shine through, yet leaves the mouth watering. A refreshing change of pace, with vinous notes in the finish. Palate is light but very appropriate for this beer. (3+) One of the more memorable beers of the weekend, and an experience Id rate higher than my numbers might suggest.

3902,"2005-07-12",4.3,"2005 RBSG Montreal Saturday. Pale red colour with a frothy pink hued white head. Tart raspberry, lactic, lightly dusty and yeasty aroma.

3902,"2005-07-11",3.6,"Pours a transparent bright ruby red with a thick, pinkish head than has good, thin lacing.  Very rich, fruity, raspberry aroma has a nice balance between sweet and tart.    Starts with a hint of candy-like sweetness, turning more dry, tart and sour with lots of raspberry fruitiness with a dry, puckering finish.  Could use a little more sweetness, but a good, refreshing beer nonetheless.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

3902,"2004-06-28",3.9,"Totally red, almost pinkish. No head, but what a red.. Intense raspberry heart nose, slightly creamy, lactic, leafy and light like a berliner weisse ought to be. Extremely refreshing on the tongue of course. Lactic, malic, citric, astringent. Good focus on the raspberry flavor, sour, but not close to the point of being agressive. Mostly thin body of course, decent carbonation despite the absence of head. Excellent summer beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Big rasberry and wheat aroma.  Onlike Rasberry Mort Subite, this beer doesnt have those sirupy mouthfeel and flavour.  Its got a nice acid bite with a big tartness and you sure can taste the fruit.
