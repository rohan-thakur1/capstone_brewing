1807,"2014-09-01",3.8,"I brought this one to our Stout Day party.


A - Pours extremely dark brown with a nice one finger tall off white head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass.


S - This one is fairly roasty with hints of coffee and chocolate. It has a tiny bit of mineral flavor as well. The smokey charred wood aroma mixes well with the dark roast.


T - Starts off with some slightly sweet dark roast quickly giving way to a mix of coffee grounds, dark chocolate, and charred wood. The finish is a mix of dark roast and light smoke, lingering on the pallet for some time. The smooth feel really helps this one out, helping to bring all the flavors together.


M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, roasty, feel throughout. Very little booze flavor in this one.


O - I really enjoyed this one. It had plenty of flavor and was easy to drink. One of the better baltic porters I have had recently. I didnt detect a lot of alcohol in this one, I think the year in the cellar did this one some good.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

1807,"2012-07-27",3.6,"Bottle shared by Lunch at my place last weekend. Thanks Paul!

A: This beer has a near black body (its on the darkest side of brown or perhaps a light black). It appears dark brown at the summit when held to the light. There is about an inch of head that leaves small traces of lacing on the glass.

S: Roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruits, alcohol.

T: A good tasting beer. Perhaps my expectations were too lofty, having tried Sexual Chocolate and Barrel-Aged Sexual Chocolate earlier that evening. Its basically a good brew, but not terribly exciting or flavorful. Notes of dark fruit soaked in alcohol, roasted malts, and chocolate comprise the bulk of the flavors.

M: Medium - thick bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Theres a warming alcohol presence in the finish.

D: A decent example of the style, though not stellar. Id be curious to have this again, as no one that tried this that night was particularly impressed.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

1807,"2012-04-24",4.3,"Originally reviewed: 8/16/10. Had this wonderful beer on tap at the brewpub this afternoon. Met a buddy there for this specific offering. Came out in their special ""high gravity"" glass. A perfect uber-black pour with a thin tan head on top. (*Note: Theres never any head on the beers at Foothills, but thats because they pour you a full glass to the rim. I would much rather have it this way, than a pretty look with less beer). Scents of dark roasted malts, a bit of alcohol, sweet cream, and faint chocolate tones.

The mouth is perfectly creamy. Just a velvet coating all over the palate. Wonderful. Great creamy flavors that finish just as smooth. Lots of dark chocolate noted. The alcohol does not make itself know in the flavor at all. Hidden well. I can feel it though. Some dark fruits in there as well. This is a splendid offering. Id have to have it side by side with the SC to compare, but it definitely is as good as SC for sure. Heres to Foothills for making my wish come true and bringing this beer back!

1807,"2011-11-21",3.9,"In short: A corpulent, roasted, chocolaty and surprisingly drinkable big black beer
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed when almost 1 year after the bottle release (first bottle release mid-aug 2010).  Bottle sent to me by changeup45, thanks a lot Gary
The look: Near black (very near black) body topped by a small tan head
In long: Nose is mostly chocolate pudding, Fig Newtons and some roast.  Taste follows in the same direction, cocoa powder, burnt fruit cake, chocolate fudge, a lot of residual sugars, dates, figs, crunchy pie crust, molasses, dark caramel.  Very roasted, even to the point of being a bit chalky.  A surprising hop presence in the finish that really felt like green hops pellet trying counterbalance the massive sweetness.  I was surprised at how easy to drink this beer was, before I knew it my bomber was gone, so the beer gets bonus points for drinkability.

The head is big and leaves some lace on the glass. The flavor is very roasty and really pretty pleasantly bitter both in a roasty coffee sort of way and a hoppy way. The hops are far more mellow than the roasty bitterness thought. The beer is really pretty dry all around
Really comes across like an excellent porter, the strength & hop character suggests an imperial porter, the clean character and the mild smokiness suggest that this is akin to a Baltic Porter.

Flavors again have a dessertish quality and a nutty character, like hazelnuts, with some creamy vibes going on as well.  Its sweet to a point, but it doesnt come across as overly sweet as the nutty qualities of the malts, the creaminess of the body, and the touch of hop bitterness in the finish make it all come together quite nicely.

Pours a dark chestnut brown color that appears almost black in the glass with mahogany edges when held to a light and a two finger light beige head. Very good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with large rings and chunks of soapy lacing.

Deep roasted dark malt aroma with a ton of dark chocolate, caramel, toffee and coffee bean. Slightly smokey but not burnt smelling at all with hints of hazelnut, milk chocolate and subtle lactic cream.

Chewy full body with an excellent balance of bitter roasted and sweet malt notes. Subtle smoke character with hints of roasted coffee/espresso bean and burnt toast. Very roasted but not acrid tasting with some lactic cream mid-palate that adds complexity and mouthfeel. The roasted notes are countered and excellently balance by hints of milk and dark chocolate, toffee, oatmeal and hazelnut. Although there is plenty of roast, this beer is bursting through with lots of luscious, silky chocolate and is incredibly well balanced. The ABV is excellently masked without a trace of alcohol heat, making this beer dangerously drinkable.

The aroma is rich and potent, with notes of cocoa powder and licorice. The flavor likewise features a dark roasted malt profile of bittersweet chocolate and licorice, but a nice pine hop bitterness and a little booze is also in there.

The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very nice. The dominant flavor is heavy, dark chocolate with some roasted malt and a little bit of sugar or molasses mixed in.

The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of milk chocolate and roasted malt, along with some cream notes. Not really a traditional Baltic Porter flavor profile, but a very enjoyable chocolate-bomb of a beer.

Pours a true auburn bordering-on-black brown with a half-finger tan head. 

A somewhat muted bouquet on the nose: some savory (roasted malt, toasted oat), some sweet (milk chocolate, sweet dark fruit). I get a little more complexity from the bottled version in the nose; on tap, it smells like caramelized malts and raisins. Deliciously balanced in the mouth. A dark fruit and chocolate beginning gives way to licorice, some smokiness, roasted malts and coffee. Slightly warming.

1807,"2010-10-15",3.5,"Bomber from August 2010, consumed relatively fresh in October 2010.  Black at first glance, closer inspection reveals a clear but dark mahogany body with glints of violet and mauve.  An initially fizzy head of dark khaki to mocha colored foam is quick to recede, leaving no lace, and nothing but a pencil lead thin ring around the edge.  The nose is pretty standard Baltic Porter fare, combining robust chocolate malt roast, creamy caramel, and hints of coffee with fruitler elements of figs, raisins, and maybe some chocolate covered raspberries. Toasted walnuts emerge, along with perhaps some hazelnuts and dark, mildly spiced rum.  Flavors again tow the line between roasty and sweet.  Toasted caramel and dry chocolate receive an infusion of hazelnut liquor, crusty bread, and some surprisingly potent, biting, earthy hops.  Brown sugar and spicy nutmeg come through on the lengthy finish.  The palate is noticeably thinner than that of other Baltics Ive tried, but it still shows decent substance.  Intensely lively carbonation needles the tongue aggressively, ushering in a dry, almost parching finish with some dry residual sugars.  Overall, its a pretty decent brew, but there are some noticeable flaws that keep this out of the top tier of the genre.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Still cant beat Duck Rabbit, especially dollar for dollar.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
1807,"2010-08-21",3.8,"Black with a small tan head.  Roasty, chocolaty, malty, coffee aroma.  The flavor is of bitter dark chocolate and is slightly ashy.  Bit of a thin body.","DENMARK","princesslala"
1807,"2010-08-16",4.4,"Got to try this one at the brewpub at the release party.  One of the first three glasses poured off the keg.  Served from tap into a Foothills fat pilsner (at least how I would describe it).  Pours a deep dark brown basically black with a one finger light tan head that lingers throughout.  Maintains phenomanial lacing throughout the glass.  The aroma was comprised of malt, subtle fruit, oatmeal, and a very slight hop hint.  The flavor was of oatmeal, malt, dark fruit, and a hint of alcohol upon warming up to room temperature.  It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation, almost a creamy texture as it goes down.  Overall this was quite an excellent brew.  Had a very smooth and creamy feel to it that made it go down oh-so easy.  The appearance on this one was quite good.  While the aroma was quite complex it lacked some intensity to it, but was still nice.  However, the flavor totally made up for the lack of aroma intensity.  This is a definite must try for sure.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","thagr81_us"
1807,"2010-08-16",4.3,"Bottle from the mighty Sams Quik Shop. Only a hint of light leaks through this near-black brew. The light tan heads pretty minimal, but lasted throughout the entire glass. I havent had a ton of Baltic Porters, so I can best describe it by comparing it to the Duck Rabbit version, which is a personal favorite. A lot of the same flavors are apparent, like dark chocolate, prunes, and coffee, though significantly more muted in taste and aroma. It also leans more towards the chocolate flavors like an imperial stout than the heavy fruits of a baltic. With almost no heat to indicate the strength, it finishes very clean with a pleasant, quick hop note. Basically, its smoother, milder, and less complex than the Duck Rabbit, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, just different. The lack of heat and already smooth flavors leaves me less inclined to age my other bottles as long as Id expected to. Perhaps Ill lay one down for a couple years to see what happens, but it just doesnt strike me as a beer meant to age.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","DukeBrewDevil"
1807,"2008-02-11",4.1,"Gold @ GABF 0 This beer is phenomenal.  Everyone raves about the Duck Rabbit Baltic Porter, but in my opinion this one smokes it.  Rich and fullbodied, very robust, chocolate and roastiness.  Some very much appreciated bitterness in the finish, but retaining balance.  Creamy with just a touch of sweetness in the finish.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

1807,"2007-05-27",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2007 On draft at a  Charlotte Mellow Mushroom (now called Moondogs or something like that).  Poured a dark brown/black; not all that much head.  Aroma was slightly sweet, with roasted malt and dark chocolate.  Flavor was much of the same with a good mouthfeel.  Could have been creamier; but still, was really good.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
1807,"2007-05-10",4.0,"draft. pretty darn close to jet black with a small head that quickly said goodbye. roasted malts with a sweet black cherry aroma in the background. wonderful roasted flavors comingling with dark chocolate and a some light cherry syrup. evrything was balanced nicely as nothing stood out and overpowered the other. bitterness in th end was very even with just enough lasting power to not disrupt you. great baltic porter. at 9% its crazy cause you defintaley dont taste it. foothills has been very impressive.","charlotte, North Carolina, USA","gottalottaibu"
1807,"2006-11-19",3.7,"Draught at Tylers in Carrboro, NC. Nose was dark roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate, slight coffee grounds. Flavor is very roasty with hunks of bitter chocolate lingering on the palate along with slight hops. Good, but missing the creamy factor that I loved so much about the Duck Rabbit interpretation. Alcohol well hidden is a plus. Still, another great BP from NC.  Foothils is a very impressive up and coming brewing.  Maybe someday Winston Salem will be known for beer instead of tobacco...but i doubt it.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Its debatable which is better here the porter or the stout, but you cant go wrong here either way.","Statesville, North Carolina, USA","masedawg"
1807,"2006-10-15",3.8,"From a growler provided by Jamie the brewer at the Knoxville Brewers Jam.
Pours black with a thin tan head.
Full roasty malt aroma comes easily, bringing bitter chocolate and a touch of coffee with it. 
Flavorwise, the bitterness keeps the sweetness in check, letting all of the roast malts and chocolate work the tongue with a sweetness that is comparable to unsweetened chocolate. Smooth and creamy. Hides the alcohol very well. Very enjoyable brew.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
1807,"2006-10-05",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2006 Well after hearing from various folks who had tried this beer at beer festivals that they seriously questioned its claims of 9% ABV I decided to figure it out for myself the only way I knew how......BY DRINKING AN ENTIRE GROWLER OF IT ALL BY MYSELF!!!!!  What I see is a nearly black beer with a nice chocolate colored head. So far, so good. I often like stuff that looks like this. The aroma hints at bitter chocolate and dark roast. Definitely dark chocolate in the flavor and definitely some roast malt. Then theres the coffee. Now I like coffee flavors in my beers and this beer has that. Its not dominate but its there. But heres the thing, the coffee flavors do sort of remind me of the poorly made, overly done, pretty much burnt coffee that you get at substandard coffee houses all over the U.S. Thats what keeps this beer from being mind blowing. Now keep in mind that Im nitpicking. I find this beer to mostly dominated by bitter chocolate. Its the slight presence of bad coffee way in the back that holds this one back but it should by no means prevent each and every person alive from bugging Foothills about making more of this. Hats off to what is probably the most consistently awesome brewery all things considered in NC. 

Oh yeah, and now that Ive finished the growler.....this shitll git ya drunk! 9% seems reasonable.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
1807,"2006-09-30",3.8,"Pours out black with a small tan head.  Aroma is roasted malts and semi sweet choco.  Flavor was very nice with lots of roasted malts.  Very nice brew, but a little thin.  I expected this to be a bit thicker.","Greensboro, North Carolina, USA","00cobraR"
1807,"2006-09-30",3.9,"Draft at Charlotte Oktoberfest 2006.  Black colored pour with a tan head.  Smell is heavy on coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and some fresh hops.  Taste is smooth and rich, though perhaps a little bit thin.  Sadly, this tent was right beside Duck Rabbit who was also serving their baltic porter.  Duck rabbits is better, but this one is really good in its own right.  This is a pretty special brew, I wish i was able to buy this locally, but sadly I cant see that happening.  These guys need to start bottling their beers.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
