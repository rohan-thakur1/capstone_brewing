Aroma more like an extra malty traditional mild; roast (coffee, some dark chocolate) - mineral character too (their water? I seem to remember other Buxton beers having a similar background bite to them), enough dry floral bitterness to be noticed. Taste follows, more chocolate and less coffee character - the mineral character deepens and sharpens in the taste - its a bit hard to ignore, really - it sticks around longer than anything else in the finish, and knocks the taste score down to 6/10. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, its airy and creamy, and the ""mineral"" thing makes it see pretty astringent, which doesnt really fit what this is aiming for, IMO - I really would rather have seen this as a milk/sweet stout - all the other elements were there ....

1650,"2012-12-26",3.5,"Bottle. Date indeterminable. Penetrable ebony. Wispy, tiny-bubbled ring of foam. Seductive chocolate fudge, blackened toffee, and espresso malt aromatics swirled with dabs of charred wood, vanilla bean, carob, black licorice and dried plums. Fairly husky with some burnt popcorn exuding. Fine carbonation. Spirited clench of cottony roast merges with stiff char which leaves behind a trail of body-thinning acids and burnt cookie crumbs. Soft bready malt depth slowly blossoms as it soundly roots itself amid the sharper char, keeping the acids at relative bay. Ample sappiness from the oily hops helps with the softening effect. Heaping stacks of malty richness ranging from burnt toffee to fudge cake gain more detail as the bittersweet notions arise. Aggressively spicy and woody hop finish is bittersweet with bakers chocolate dribbled with reduced espresso oiliness atop a chocolate cake heftiness and unremitting char. Well, aside from the rampant huskiness in both the nose and flavor, this is very nicely constructed. Im quite tickled to see a circa 4% bottle-conditioned stout available in the States, which are woefully scarce here.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1650,"2012-11-07",3.8,"Tasted from the bottle, bought @Buxton Brewery on 06/11/2012.
Looks just beautiful, in totally black color, with just a small creamy head.
Aroma is quite intense, notes of roasted&toasted barley malts dominate, could feel a bit of oats as well, also a hint of nuts and char.
Mouthfeel is lovely, just a tiny bit silky smooth and medium carbonated.
For a beer that has only 4% abv, taste is really complex, well balanced with aroma, roasted notes are the most distinct again, but also having a pleasant mix of charcoal, ashy and woody tones in it. 
That pallete feels delicious and quite harmonic.
After some warming up could feel a hint of dark chocolate in aroma as well.
Aftertaste is pleasant and long-lasting, with the notes of coal and toasted bread.
To conclude, there's nothing ""kinder"" except the abv level in this stout, very serious drink! With no doubt,
