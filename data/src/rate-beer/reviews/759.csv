A little unusual, this bottle mixes the typical dunkelweiss profile with an earthy bit of truffle and walnut. The results provide a pleasant experience which demonstrates the mastery that Perennial has when they put their minds to a style.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid base might be a little thin bodied. The fast fading ivory head gives some contrast though. Chocolate, truffles, black walnuts, and malt radiate upwards with an ephemeral feel that takes a minute or two to dissipate.

Flavor / Palate - Bubbly cola, black walnut, and dry woody textures of a forest floor sneak into the corners of the mouth. Taking the style in a new direction the profile manages to mix traditional with experimental in a way that makes me wish I had another pour available.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

759,"2013-04-06",3.5,"Tap, pours dark brown, nearly black with tan head and great sporadic lacing. Aromas/flavor of plum, dark fruit, sweet malts, and very light walnut. Wish there was more in there. Very belgian tasting got a german style. Overall, still a nice brew from Perennial.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
759,"2013-04-03",3.6,"On tap half pint at Gilly's Craft Beer & Wine in Rockville, MD. 

Murky to opaque, walnut brown with a small khaki head and excellent lacing that unfortunately does not linger. 

Aroma of walnut, maple, caramel, yeast and toffee.

Taste of sweet dark fruit, citrus, roasted malt, brown sugar, nuts and lots of toffee and caramel at the finish.

Medium/light body and medium/high carbonation.

This a very interesting beer.  The aroma does not tip off the sweet fruity and malty flavor.  They have done a great job of extracting the walnut essence, especially the aromas.

759,"2013-03-23",4.1,"750mL capped bottle.  Bottled on 2/2013.  I have to admit this was pretty damn delicious, was not expecting.  I will also add I had no idea this was a wheat beer and was surprised to read that on the bottle.  I got no esters in this beer.  General a clean, slightly earthy maltiness.  Has a mild and cool sweet, not sugary aspect that I could only attribute to the walnuts.  I really liked it.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Taste is not too sweet, some mineral water body, mild chocolate syrup, ripe banana dessert. Good, but walnut addition could go unnoticed. My best guess is that it manifests itself in a slightly richer fatty mouthfeel.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

759,"2013-01-01",3.5,"Dark brown coloured body with a thick, four centimetre tall tan head that fades like soda and even makes the same noise (fizz). Aroma of toasted malt, alcohol, soap, cleanser, yeast and a hint of nuts (walnuts, I guess). Medium-bodied; Nice malty flavour with some subdued pit fruit sweetness from raisins and prunes with a hint of nuttiness at the end and perhaps a little bit of light spices such as allspice and nutmeg. Aftertaste has a good balance of malt and sweetness with the alcohol showing a touch, but not overdone by that or the nuttiness. Overall, a decent beer - but not as good as I was expecting nor representative of the style at all. This is a classic Dunkles not a Dunkleweizen at all - Im not sure how that was misrepresented. I sampled this 75 cL bottle purchased from New Beer Distributors in New York, New York on 04-July-2012 for US$12.25 sampled at home as the first beer of the new year on 01-January-2013 here in Washington.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

759,"2012-09-16",3.5,"750ml and served in a Duvel snifter: Pours a medium brown hue with a mostly lasting frothy off-white head and little lace. The aroma has notes of rustic caramel and toffee malts, some red wheat and char, very heavy walnut  and plum vapours along with a dash of black pepper. The taste is malt forward as expected with a utterly nutty and earthy overtone. Rich caramel and light fruity tones as well. What I would have like to have seen is a bit of the weizen yeast character which would have added depth IMO. The mouth feel is lively  and medium-bodied with a sticky finish. Overall a solid dunkel but leans far to much towards that side and not enough weizen character for me. I could buy again, a nice fall/football brew.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

759,"2012-08-28",3.5,"I grew up in Missouri with black walnut ice cream, and the essence of it is definitely in this beer. It adds a creamy and somehow fruity impression to the malty flavor and mellow bitterness, and overall I found the beer a bit sweeter than Id like. But it brought back memories of my grandparents farm, walking through the orchards, crunching shells underfoot with my cousins. Evocative.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"

Pours a dark brown with a two finger beige head. No visible lacing. A pleasing aroma with notes of banana, cocoa, subtle spice, and earthiness. Opens with subtle toffee and cocoa joined by nutty banana bread, and finishes smooth with mild earthiness. Lighter-side of medium bodied. The level of carbonation is perfect, pleasant, but not in a way that disrupts the silky, smooth mouthfeel. The black walnuts really add a new dimension to an excellent dunkelweizen base. Another excellent brew from Perennial. They have yet to disappoint.","Illinois, USA","chanokokoro"

759,"2012-05-21",3.6,"On tap at Fountainhead (Chicago, IL). Pours a rich deeper brownish pour, firm haziness, light glowing notes. A cakey light brown is moderated sized, sticks around ok. Aromas gentle nutty elements, touches of brown malts, earthy, a touch of fruity quality. Toast, mellow toffee, and biscuits. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a touch lighter, with touches of carmelization, cocoa, and faint kiss of anise. Some good earthy nutty qualities, touches of toasted earth, faint cocoa, and the inevitable caramel bit. Mellow kiss of banana, the esters are farther back than youd think fairly light. More darkness than fruit. Middle is gentle dryness, some sticky body, really still staying fairly balanced, just a kiss of dark fruit but earthy overall. Mellow black olive, dark fruit, caramel, touches of sticky malts, toast, and earth on the finish. It doesnt necessarily dry up, but it does stay fairly balanced, mellow body and touches of smoothness, gentle dark fruit. Faint toasty elements and carmelization.

759,"2012-03-15",4.0,"Some hints of dark malts in the aroma. Some yeast phenolics are there as well. Pours a deep mahogany color with a dense tan colored head that hangs around forever. Very nice flavor. The wheat malt gives this a nice creamy texture. It feels much more thick and rich than a typical dunkel weiss. The walnuts add a nice flavor that only enhances the richness of this beer. It marries well with the chocolaty flavor of the dark malts. This beer is definitely heavier than the base beer would suggest, not that this is a bad thing at all! It just is way more beefy than the 6.6% ABV on the bottle would lead you to believe.
