439,"2014-03-01",3.5,"Tap at Carlyle. Orange-tan body with a soapy white head. Intense vanilla aroma. Intense vanilla forward flavor. Medium bodied, clean, to style, very drinkable. The vanilla is a tad artificial potentially, but the flavor is still nice. OK.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
439,"2013-01-06",3.7,"Draft @ Carlyle. Pours a lightly cloudy dark gold with about a finger of white head. Aroma of vanilla and some light herbal hops. Taste is strongly vanilla with a little cotton candy. Awesome beer. Very light and easy drinking.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"
439,"2012-12-13",3.0,"I had a glass of this on-tap on site. This pours a medium brown color with a foamy white head. The scent of vanilla is quite evident. Upon tasting there isnt as much vanilla in the flavor as the scent would indicate, the rest of the taste is that of bland earthy grains. The taste does grow on you as you drink but still it could be better. Finishes off a little chalky and dry.","Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA","Lemke10"
439,"2012-06-30",2.5,"At the brewpub. Im glad I didnt get more than a sample. While it was a good example of what it was going for, it tastes and smells a lot like drinking a Voortmans vanilla wafers. Tasty but for me only in small quantities. serving:tap","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
439,"2012-06-02",3.3,"Golden with a medium sized white head that left a lot of lacing. The aroma is that of a root beer float sans root beer with a very light amount of grain. The flavor was sweet, with strong vanilla and some grains, maybe corn on the finish. Slightly better than I had expected, but dont think I could have more than one in a row.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"
439,"2011-11-03",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub, pours a hazy golden orange with a thin white head, the aroma is huge with vanilla and candy, the flavor hasa nice sweetness of vanilla with a nice sharp finish, one of the more enjoyable brews I had here.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"
439,"2011-05-14",3.4,"Had a pint at the brewpub.  I love the smell of vanilla.  That being said, I HATE flavored beer.  This beer...not half bad.  Pours like a rich, golden ale with a soft/fully head.  Has a floral, flowery, vanilla aroma. The taste and palate are too sweet for my palate, but if I had to drink a flavored beer, this would be it.","Belvidere, Illinois, USA","BelvidereIPA"
439,"2011-01-12",3.5,"RBSG 2010 in Grand Rapids.  Pale golden orange pour.  Bright vanilla aroma.  Fresh and sweet with loads of vanilla character.  Soft sweetness through the middle - its not cloying or chewy but you dont get much in the way of malt character either.  Lingering vanilla flavour - it really does drink like a cream soda.  Pretty nice actually.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
439,"2010-09-21",3.5,"poured at RBSG10 Grand Tasting  -arouma is cream soda, sugary... but more attenuated in taste. Dry and touch of booze on the finish. Nice, actually.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"
439,"2010-09-01",3.4,"Sampled at RBSG 10, from guyinchicago. Thanks! Pours a pale yellow with a fizzy head. Nose is floral vanilla notes, natural. Some light corn and grain as well. On taste, the vanilla is supllementary rather than cloying. Not overly sweet and actually quite well made. Nice!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
439,"2010-08-25",3.6,"Had this at the Grand Tasting during RBSG.  Aromas of pipe tobacco, cigars, soft vanilla, M&Ms and Reeses Pieces.  Smooth malt and toast.  Clear light sweetness, cream soda on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
439,"2010-07-27",3.5,"Growler shared by guyinchicago at the RBSG 10 Grand Tasting. Poured a clear amber gold with a white head that dissipated slowly. Aroma was sweet with lots of vanilla with a backing cream note. Flavor was sweet as well from the vanilla but more reserved as the cream balanced nicely.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
439,"2010-07-26",3.3,"Growler shared at RBSG by guyinchicago. Thanks! Pours a clear golden color with a medium head. Good head retention and lacing. Big vanilla notes in the aroma, along with pale malty notes and caramel. The taste is vanilla, pale malty notes, and a nutty finish. A bit on the sweet side but still pretty nice.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
439,"2009-07-27",4.0,"Definite vanilla taste, with a slightly creamy palate.  This beer has the flavors I was looking for, but I think it could be better with a stronger vanilla presence.  If you like cream soda and beer, you will like this.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","weitz15"
439,"2009-06-27",2.9,"After many a time at Carlyle avoiding the vanilla, I finally got to sample this brew.Arrives a hazy golden color, moderate white head and carbonation. The nose on this brew is a heavy dose of vanilla, lightly sweet giving it the characteristics of a vanilla ice cream float as opposed to a beer. Flavor has a pronounced vanilla presence but it honestly isnt as overbearing as I thought it would be. Flavors are very smooth with the vanilla, light malty notes and a sweet, creamy sugar flavor, blending to create a decent beer.  Overall a lot better than I was expecting, with it leaning toward the non-overpowering vanilla beer end of the style.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
439,"2008-05-15",3.6,"on tap at brewery pours cloudy gold with off white creamy head,smells of vanilla and liberty hops at least i think they are. sweet like a cream soda with a nice hop arrangement to keep it  check the wife hates beer. shes my little whiskey girl, but drank this one maybe an up and coming brewer","Illinois, USA","TheGuy"
439,"2007-11-18",3.3,"On tap at the brewpub on 6/20/07: Pours a transparent deep golden with a frothy creamy thin-lacing white head.  Aroma of sweet candied vanilla along with some pale malt.  Body starts with some sweet sugary vanilla flavor before fading into a more blander finish.  Has good vanilla balance and is an interesting brew.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
439,"2007-10-20",3.4,"On tap at brewpub
After a few lighter beers the mood began to slowly shift.  This one was a bit darker but still along the same lines as the previous samples.  I would have considered a full pint of it.  Its an interesting change of pace from the norm.  It reminds me more of cream soda than beer but perhaps that is why I thought it was fun.
Aroma / Appearance - The hazy body was the color of cream soda and smelled likewise.  This one might be alcoholic but it would be hard to tell from the nose.  It is straightforward and simple.
Flavor / Palate - Vanilla cream soda is held up by a faint malty taste.  It reminds me more of a soft drink than a beer; it was painless to finish and fun to try.  I dont know that I would drink it often but the occasional pint would be nice.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

lots of vanilla flavor, sweet but a light bitterness holds back the sweetness and keeps it from getting too out of control,

439,"2007-05-24",2.7,"On tap at the brewery. Hazy light orange body, thick off-white head. Strong vanilla aroma which carries over to the body. Hiding beneath the vanilla are light biscuity, cerealy notes. In particular I noticed a corn bran characteristic. The vanilla is stronger than suggested in the description. Quaffable nonetheless.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
439,"2007-05-10",3.0,"Sampler. Light orange body. Vanilla very evident in nose and, of course, in the taste. But in proper quantities, not too much. A lot of cream soda flavor, more than cream ale. I might suggest its not for everyone, though at the moment, its as close as they have to a fruit beer.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

439,"2006-12-16",3.1,"I wouldve classified this as a spiced ale despite the name.  (Cream Ale does not means ""tastes like Cream Soda""!)  Still, I like it because I was a sucker for cream soda as a kid.  Its got a yellow body with a frothy gold head that laces nicely and it smells of vanilla beans.  The taste is that of a flavored American wheat ale with an orange pip bitterness in the finish.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

439,"2006-07-22",2.7,"Im a cream ale fan and a fan of vanilla.   As said in previuos reviews the vanilla extract over powers this lightly hopped cream ale.   Unique, it just did not agree with my palate.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
439,"2006-02-20",3.3,"Vanilla extract and some powdered sugar aroma.  Hazy orange body.  Pale malt, bitter hop leaf and more vanilla extract in the falvor.  Medium mouthfeel.  A nice drink but nothing youd want to do all night, the strong vanilla character gets old after a bit.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
439,"2006-02-19",3.4,"The beer pours to a bronzed copper body with a thin white head.  The aroma is light.  Vanilla and light grains.

439,"2006-02-13",3.3,"Tap at the brewpub:  Very light in color with minimal haed.  Definate vanilla on initial smell with a little spice on second sniff.  Great vanilla taste with no real difference in the finish.  A great sweet lighter beer!","Machesney Park, Illinois, USA","McKnizzle69"
439,"2006-02-07",3.3,"On tap at the brewpub.Hazy straw-colored gold; medium white head with surprisingly chunky lacing for such a nominally light brew. Aroma of vanilla plus spicy & sour-grassy hops. Flavor is sweet, natural-tasting vanilla first and foremost, bolstered by grassy hops up front, then malt sweetness comes online followed by moderate hop bitterness. Tingly, medium palate. Nice smooth stuff that beer snobs and Miller swillers can mutually countenance; plus it makes a nice treat when mixed half-and-half with whatever stout or porter they happen to have on tap at any given time.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"
439,"2005-09-14",3.3,"Wow, they arent kidding when they say vanilla. Hazy copper, thin white head with lots of vanilla in the nose. Taste is strong vanilla pfront then just a hint of grains or barely, soft, I really dont like the taste of vanilla but it is drinkable.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
439,"2005-08-08",3.4,"Bright translucent yellow-orange with a thin grey sheet for the head.  Wonderful aroma, chock full of creamy vanilla and white chocolate.  Vanilla Tootsie Rolls come to mind.  Leading into flavor, vanilla plays up its prominence, joined by a crisp hops appeal and signature lemony-lager characteristics.  Its got a lively light body and perhaps a little too much carbonation, but the vanilla finish and aftertaste remind me of why Im a sucker for vanilla anything.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
439,"2004-07-02",3.1,"Sample at the brewpub.  Hmmm, 3rd vanilla creme ale Ive had in 2 days in Illinois.  Weird.  Medium amber, a bit dullish looking.  Strong vanilla nose with a twist of caramel.  Vanilla, cherry, perhaps a touch of rosemary and tarragon in the flavor...hints of sourness and bitterness towards the end, but the vanilla lingers.  Definitely above average for what it is.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
439,"2004-03-24",3.1,"Draught:  Now this was a different beer.  It was kind of a golden color.  There wasn't a whole lot of head.  The nose is vanilla and only vanilla.  Nothing else could get through.  There is an initially a sweet taste containing the vanilla, but it immediately gives way to a dry and unsweet taste.  Some malts to the taste, but no sweetness or bitterness.  DIFFERENT.  This was OK, but it's not for me.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
