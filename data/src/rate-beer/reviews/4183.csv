4183,"2017-05-12",3.9,"Bottle into glass. Huge malt profile hits you right from the start with strong roasted grains, caramel and toast aromas with muted scents of dark dried fruits. Zero hops. Looks like coke in the glass, apart from the head retention. No lacing, and a quickly dissipating head led to the low appearance rating - otherwise hard to fault. Taste was beautifully sweet, almost sticky in its flavour. Palate was medium and medium carbonation. Just perfect. Great beer.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","DavidAust"
4183,"2017-03-13",3.6,"330ml bottle. Pointe with an initially one-finger but fading light tan head leaving a soapy lace atop a deep, ruddy hued brown body. Aromas of raisin, prune, coffee, roasted malts, liquorice and toffee. Mid-weight, medium carbonation and a moderate length and intensity bittersweet malt finish. Nice beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","sm89walt"
4183,"2016-12-02",3.5,"Mild aroma of cocoa and dark chocolate. Flavour is relatively mild notes of coffee, dark chocolate and burnt toffee. It is very nice and drinkable.","AUSTRALIA","Tezminator"
4183,"2016-08-12",3.6,"330ml bottle into schooner glass. Rich dark chocolate nose. Black beer with frothy tan-coloured head. Medium body, slightly zingy mouthfeel. Hints of coffee lead to more chocolate and dark fruit. Excellent semi-sweet bock.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"
4183,"2015-12-08",3.7,"From bottle. Pours surprisingly dark with a rich tan head. Bit of complexity and easy to drink; packs a lot in for only 5.5 ABV well worth drinking","","ngunity"

4183,"2015-07-03",3.9,"Bottle from local IGA, Canberra. Rich black, tan head, dark malt aroma (melanoidins?). Rich dark malt flavour, a hint of roastiness. Medium body, medium carbonation. Slight sweetness up front with balanced mild bitterness. Nice surprise. Very nice!","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
4183,"2015-02-20",3.3,"My Scottish mate disliked this so much he dubbed it ""Balmain Boak"". Or in other words, it made him nauseous. No accounting for taste. Its a fair dunkler and certainly the most interesting in the handful of beers Ive tried from this brewer. Teak body with some length in the head. Dried fruit in the aroma - sultanas, dates - plus milky coffee, cola nut and white pepper. Soft mouthfeel but a little thin in the swallow. Chocolate malt, coffee grounds, faint nuttiness, mild bitterness. Very drinkable but not a style I adore. Bit too thin and sweet. (330ml bottle from Leura Cellars)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
4183,"2014-09-30",3.8,"Bottle from Beer Cartel (Sep 2014). Darkest brown, 2cm tan head, chocolate, coffee beans, burnt toast, slightly smoky, fruity hops, light body, thin texture, quite a dry bitter finish. Very nice.","AUSTRALIA","ShaneJ"
4183,"2014-09-14",3.7,"Pours dark brown with a large, light tan head.
Nose shows soft roast, bready melanoidin notes, figs and burnt caramel.
Roasty flavours with some sweet bready malt bringing it back into bock territory. A little burnt fig as well.
Carbonation is a little high.
Very roasty for a bock.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
4183,"2014-09-04",3.8,"From 330 ml bottle. Pours a dark cola brown with a fluffy tan head that sticks around. Aromas of milk chocolate, raisins, cinnamon and a touch of smoke. The taste starts out with soft fruit, lifted by the carbonation with a slight mineral note in the background. Chocolate and cherry emerge in the mid-palate before a smokey note comes out. Long finish with a light coffee and smoke aftertaste. Light to medium bodied in keeping with the style. Might tiptoe into porter territory at times, but this is pretty good.","Camp Hill, AUSTRALIA","Jado"
4183,"2014-07-18",4.2,"330ml bottle from Brewski 180714. By far the best of the 3 Balmain beers I have had. Thick black with a solid tan head. Smokey campfire aromas that lead into a smokey flavour.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"

4183,"2012-11-03",3.9,"Had at the Australian Heritage Hotel beer festival at the Rocks. Great malt aroma. Lovely dark malt flavours and very smooth. A well made beer.
