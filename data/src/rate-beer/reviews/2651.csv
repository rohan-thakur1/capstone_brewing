I guess I should have paid more attention to previous reviews around the total flat carbonation of this beer - there is none. Its super sweet, flat, and smoky. If I wanted that taste profile, I would rather have scotch. Honestly, this would be a drain pour for me, if not for the scarcity and work for me to get it. Too bad, I love other HOTD beers and heavy BA strong ales. The flat carbonation absolutely destroyed my enjoyment of this beer.","Illinois, USA","courtneysux"

2651,"2016-12-04",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. Originally reviewed 4/4/2012. Dark brown murky pour with no head. Not even a stray bubble. Flat as hell. Lots of gross looking sediment at the bottom of the bottle.

The nose is out there. Chocolate, apple, leather that all combines to smell like bourbon-barrel Coca-Cola. Sweet aroma. Boozy, too. Fascinating and very nice.

Tastes of sweet caramel, apple, and again coca-cola. Leathery, but not enough to balance out the sweetness. Licorice. I get a lot of the Eau de Vie, but not a lot of the bourbon barrel in the taste. Very sweet.

Flat as hell. Thick and syrupy. Sweet. Everything that makes it tough to drink.

2651,"2016-01-03",4.4,"12 oz bottle purchased at the Brewery Tap Room (Portland, OR). Consumed on site, 2010 Vintage. Pours a deeper hazy brownish hue, some purple jabs of dried fruit, tamarind color with a gentle glow on the edges that is subtle. Loose bubbly head dies to a mellow ringer, tannish layer laces smaller but the nature of the beer likely leads to that. Aromas are dried fruit, a bit of raisin and vanilla meet jabs of toast, caramel and faint cocoa. More dark and dried fruit preach plum, black cherries and raisin elements mixing with some decent growing bourbon influence, spirit and vanillin, gentle warmth and subtle apple influenced spirit. A bit deeper, residual brown sugar and gentle caramel malts behind with mellow toast. Initial is medium bodied, a touch of barrel thinning leaves it with a touch of body. Caramel and oak meet dark fruit, subtle yeastiness and some fuzzy tannic oak. Gentle spiciness, dying sweetness and more raisin, gentle tannic and sticky faint molasses appeal, brown malts. A fruit element that melds and expands, dark fruit, gentle apple, some nice oak elements and oxidized and sherry like vinous appeal is firm and flowing. Rich flavors, sufficient expertly manicured oak influence as this one ends up smooth and rich all at the same time. Chocolatey and biscuity, so much going on as the flavors ebb and flow wonderfully. Rich and flavorful, a good mastered blending and aging time as this one ends up light enough without being just oak/spirit dominated. Rich, a bit carmelized, brown malt and molasses mix with toastiness, oak, and gentle fruit, dark fruit and plum. Subtle honey, earth, oak and that gentle apple spirit really adds some complexity on top of that lovely well managed bourbon spirit. Delicious masterfully crafted stuff. World class. While the nose and pour arent necessarily winning awards, the flavors and flow contained within definitely are.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

A modest, thin tan ring around the edge is the only sign of life. Insane aroma; honestly one of the best in business. Dizzyingly complex. Black cherries, figs, oak, vanilla beans, bourbon, semi-tart apples, caramelized brown sugar, toffee, blackcurrants & plums, ashy tobacco, light char, smoke, & a beautiful residual sweetness that ropes everything together & never comes off as overpowered or cloying. The alcohol commands itself on the palate, but asserts robustness rather than messiness, as the integration is nearly seamless. Sweet apples drenched in bourbon with a huge melange of fruit coming off; cherry, grape, plum, sugar coated dates, & currants, all coated in a thick lacquer of sticky toffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, & sherry. Lots of wood & spicy, wet oak in the periphery with a finish that veers more towards the signature Hair of the Dog flavors of ashy tobacco leaves, earthy leather, & mild smoked cedar. Huge beer on the palate, thick enough to cut with a knife; viscous, oily, coating.

No head.
Body is black.

Aroma is heavily malty (caramel, chocolate, roasted grain), with notes of alcohol, brown sugar, cognac, raisin, wood.

Flavor is heavily to harshly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Full body, syrupy texture, soft/flat carbonation, heavily alcoholic.

Smells fairly nice, but its mostly sugary notes that warn you of its sweetness. And holy balls is it sweet...undrinkably so. I tried, god did I try at 18 frickin dollars for a 12oz bottle. But I could not do it. My teeth/gums ached at every sip. So syrupy, fatiguing, and cloying, ugh. I could perhaps put up with the strong throat burn if it was just anywhere close to being balanced, but as it is, the blazing alcohol just adds insult to injury. Over 80% of the bottle went down the tap drain, Im sad to say. This was once a great brewery.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Very little head, although a ring of tan foam does pop up eventually and leave some lacing on the glass. Aroma is definitely ""from the wood."" There is something very distinctive about HOTDs barrel aged beers. Very rich aroma, dark fruits, lots of dark sugars, molasses, burned caramel, a bit of smoke, perhaps cherry, bourbon of course, oak, chocolate. Flavor is basically heaven - a bit smoky, oaky, bourbon, lots and lots of dark fruity and sugary notes. Quite sweet, with some woody astringence and not much bitterness. Full body, creamy mouthfeel. Some heat evident, but considering that it is 12.5% I would say it drinks pretty well. Yep, this beer deserves its status. Awesome.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

Pour is murky very dark brown with some red nuances and an almost non-existing head. The head that is, is a few light tan bubbles around the edges of my glass. 
Oh boy, is this delicious and complex, with really much going on. Light smoke, plenty of leather, caramel, wood, bourbon, vanilla, bourbon soaked dark fruits, slight green apples, apple-pie with a burnt crust, burnt sugar, slight banana. UHH, really a lot, and its all rounded up beautifully by the light apple-smokiness in the end (With a little booze added). Oh boy how I dig this.
The taste is rather sweet up-front, with a somewhat harsh bitterness to it. This has a loooong and really well balanced aftertaste of applesmoke and 
burnt sugar.
Medium n oily body, with a sticky texture and a really flat carbonation. I really do enjoy this beer, and could have my nose camping in the glass for hours, cause this smells amazing.

A: Black like charred ash. A thin creme lacing and sticky, sticky legs.

N: Deep inhalations of smoke and apple brandy. Chocolate and leather drift in and out between the charred oak. Theres deep vanilla here and caramel. Rich and inviting. 

T: Smoke, candi sugar, and malt. Bourbon and oak notes overlap with the apple brandy depth. A second layer of chocolate and leather. This is absolutely superb. 

M: A hefty body with a completely shocking lack of alcohol. This is carbonated, if barely. Lingers. 

O: A complete tour de force. The 2010 is the superior vintage, by far, in my estimation, and this is drinking quite well at 2 years old. Glad I have more.

2651,"2012-03-06",3.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/19/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.

No carbonation in this beer means there is no head sitting on top of a dark brown beer with a cherry tint.

Lots of apple brandy in the nose, which by itself provides a lot of complexity. Some brown sugar and caramel malt join in the background.

The taste is composed of caramel malt with some brown sugar up front, some figs, raisins, and a touch of sweet cherries next, then a good dash of apple brandy. A bit of alcohol bite, a touch of what I can best describe as spruce, and some general spiciness close out the flavor. It has a relatively clean finish.

The complete lack of carbonation reduces my enjoyment of the beer and is fairly noticeable throughout each sip. Other than that, it has a full body, some stickiness, and some slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat.

Proper carbonation would make this better and really send it into a different category. As is, the flavor is pretty good, but it just does not have all the pieces.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

2651,"2011-11-03",4.6,"Well well well.. finally opening one of these after buying it last November at the 10AM release at the brewery for the 2010 version - thanks to those Portland dudes who dumped me off at Brass Horse after - Beardface and leems - a double thanks for not simply raping me and dumping me in an alley on the way. Poured out a beer - a beer with colour and a bunch of stuff on top of the beer. Mostly very dark with a reverse horizon of deep crimson redness on the bottom of my glass. There is a thin head that is a dark tan and its quite compact, never leaves and leaves quickly migrating colonies of foam back to the surface. The aroma is simply fucking amazing. This has been worth the wait - I heard that it was a bit hot early so I just let it sit with nervous anticipation in the farthest corner of The Beerium. First sniffs and sneak tastes prove that this is not only an exceptional beer but that it is the upper class of the upper class. I already feel that I am not doing this brew justice by not wearing a stove pipe top hat. I have also temporarily legally changed my name to Cheswick McGavinington III because being English with a stuffy name always adds the required misplaced status one requires. Ahhhh - the aroma - yes, it is very consistent so far: that familiarity with calvados sticks strong with this Mt. Hood version (thanks google!). Ahhh calvados - one of my best memories of the now defunct high end restaurant in Vancouver - the greatest place ever - Lumiere. Me and Leah had some calvados after a 4hr supper / winefest / drunkfest and it was orgasmic - nothing like flying Vancouver just to have supper and then pretending to jerk it as I call out ""calvados.... calvaaaados"" in a drunken stupor as the Maitre D stood behind me to my wifes amusement - it was just that damn good. Vanilla creaminess, delectable apple strudelishness, faint golden raisins, faint alcohol on the warmer side of the pour, dark and very fresh fruits of the plum and apricot variety, molasses and melted dark sugars, fig and chocolate, woody smoke intertwined and flowing in and out of my nose in waves and sweet succulent bourbon and then apple perfection once again - pretty much nothing smells better than this.

The taste does not let me down after such an incredible experience with the aroma and non-thinking sips. A bit syrupy and thats cool, Apple goodness, bourbon + side of the tongue burn, back to that apple woodiness that makes this beer so wonderful, tart notes often, burnt malts and heavy molasses flavour with out being too much to handle - maybe it is but there are so many other things that have piled on. The smoke gets infiltrated by some fresh tart dark fruits but keeps its identity as a defining character in and out of the fringes. Tobacco / chocolate mix, more apple notes, plum, raisin, burnt sugar - the stuff that you use to make gingerbread houses, here and there spice, oak (I assume), honey, awesome. Finishes often with an ashy chocolate lingering that transforms into charred wood and a light fruity note. Not oily. That was a stunningly memorable brew.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

2651,"2011-06-28",3.2,"Poured into a snifter. 2010 vintage. Big thanks to piclee for this.

2.0 A: Deep brown almost black color. Minimally carbonated and did not form a head.

4.0 S: Leathery bourbon and slightly boozy apple brandy are most noticeable. Bourbon adds tobacco and peat elements. Underneath there is fig, raisin, smoke, prune, and hints of chocolate. Caramel galore. The barrels give a subtle vanilla and a slightly more aggressive oak. Pretty good here, but a little subdued overall. Some more carbonation certainly would have helped.

3.5 T: The taste is much unlike the nose in that the flavors are INTENSE! Again, bourbon and apple brandy strike first, but this is definitely not a bourbon bomb (which I always appreciate since Im one of a few people on here that like beer more than bourbon). Bourbon and brandy give leather, peat, tobacco, plenty of sweet but earthy apple, a pleasant vanilla, and moderate amounts of oak. Fairly boozy as the full 11.50% is realized. Again theres plenty of dark fruit: fig, plum, prune, raisin, and a bit of black currant. Ridiculously complex with tons of caramel. However, this beer has one fatal flaw that dropped the taste score quite a bit. Its distractingly sweet. The first sip almost knocked me on my ass. Toward the end of the glass, Im starting to get used to it, but Id rather really enjoy 12 oz instead of 3 or 4. Im pretty sure this would still be a bit too sweet if it had carbonated the whole way, but who knows.

4.5 M: Full body. Even in spite of the lacking carbonation (there is a little bit), this is wonderful on the tongue. Rich and velvety, which is just what I what for a beer of this nature. Just the slightest bit chewy and fairly smooth given the booziness.

4.0 D: Good beer that could have been great. Great balance between the barrel components and the beer itself. While this wasnt totally flat, the lack of proper carbonation made the nose less impressive, the taste too sweet, and prevented the mouthfeel from being a perfect 5.0. I would easily want to drink this again with a hope of better carbonation.

Overall : Like others have noted, this would have been much better with a bit more carbonation and it seem that this varies from one bottle to another.. oh well. Great complexity with lots of smokey/ashy notes. Borderline harsh. Interesting light apple-ish notes here and there. Great finish with the nice smoke and ashes combined with the light sweetness and the warmth of alcohol/spirit. Bottom line, this is a very rich and tasty sipper with lots of personality but the lack of carbonation really impairs all this. Still it has a lovely sweetness both on nose and taste. Even with the lack of carbonation I enjoyed this quite a lot. With a bit of luck Ill get the chance to try it again.. with carbonation this time !","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

2651,"2011-03-02",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Dark chocolate lengths gel to a rising smoke, while wooden barrel and alcohol heat surround prunes and raisins. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A few bubbles of head slowly disappear into the darkest brown.
-The flavor profile sometimes reminds me of a bacon-flavored dark chocolate bar. Which is a good thing.
-There might be a little too much barrel presence in the aroma to my liking.
-If this were more carbonated, it would be a masterpiece. As is, it is ""just"" very good to me.
-This quiet carbonation makes the sweetness and abv warmth more apparent.

G: Poured into an oversized snifter.

A: Cola brown coming out of the bottle, gathering into a near-black as it sits in the glass. Almost zero head. Faint swirls as the beer warms up and is swirled. This also creates mild lacing. 

S: Caramel with lots of dark fruits and hints of green apple. Perhaps the tiniest bit of anise. Some hints of oak, as well as plenty of warming esters from the alcohol. Some yeasty sourness. 

T: Smokiness is my initial impression. More of the tart green apple than was present in the nose. The same hints of oak are there as well. As it warms up, the apple brandy and oak tastes are coming out a bit more. 

M: Medium bodied with very little carbonation. Not too many hints of alcohol. 

D: A very nice sipper. Complexity increases as it warms up. An all-around very good brew.

2651,"2010-04-13",4.0,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Courtesy of Dr. Bill.  Pours a deep brown color, mostly transparent, with tannic hues and a thin layer of wispy white.  Aromas of apple, golden raisins, faint smoke, and a touch of bourbon.  Some musty, cherry skin aromas noted, and detract a bit from the otherwise rich malt/bourbon characters.  As it opens up, some of the dark fruit and soft vanilla components intensify, developing a port-like quality.  Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel with a rich, chewy texture, yet not sticky sweet.  Could use more carbonation, but whats there is enough to lighten up the palate sufficiently. Flavors of chocolate and smoke up front on the palate, followed by some roasted notes and bourbon alcohol warmth.  Hints of pepper and cherry pie from the wood, although the cherry character is much less noticeable in the flavor than in the aroma.  Some burned caramel and molasses sweetness accompany notes of port wine and raisin.  Flavors of tobacco and leather linger long into the finish along with a hint of bacony smoke. The smoke is clearly there, yet is integrated well into the beer and doesnt dominate.  Overall, a complex, enjoyable beer.  Theres definitely a lot going on, most of which is highly enjoyable.  Thanks, Doc!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

2651,"2010-04-10",3.3,"Murky dark brown color with no head whatsoever.  Aroma is of oak, cocoa, toast and it also has a meatiness to it.  Sweet caramel and dark fruit also come through in the nose.  Smokelike taste gives a bit of a bacon flavor and theres also a suggestion of peated malt.  Rich caramel and dark fruits are also present with a bit of barrel character.  Full bodied with minimal carbonation, this certainly wouldnt need much carbonation, but it could use more than it has.   Still pretty nice and smooth on the tongue.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

2651,"2010-03-24",4.4,"12 oz bottle, via 5000.  Pours a dark mahogany brown body with a small beige head that ran to a thin ring. The nose is sour, smoky and oaky with some dark fruits, light apple, dark cocoa, and some light vanilla and bourbon notes.  Very deep and complex smelling.  Deep dark fruity and smoked malts mingle wonderfully with the vanilla and oak barrel influences.  Somehow the residual sweetness from the candy sugar on the finish really works awesome with the smoke and apple notes.  Amazingly well hidden alcohol, I almost cant believe this is 11.5%.  The mouthfeel is very velvety and smooth with perfect soft minimal carbonation.  This beer is just crazy good.  Id take this over Adam, and thats no small statement at all.

2651,"2010-03-16",4.3,"On tap @ HOTD. Before serving me a taster, Alan went ahead with the boldest claim: Its much more complex than Adam. I was a non-believer, but now, I just dont know. Upon the first whiff, the similar base to Adam is noticeable as roasty, vinous hints develop into realms of complexity. Fruity and bourbony paths are taken, leading into a clearing of apple flavours thanks to its Apple brandy barrel sojourn. As the sip evolves, you can reconstruct its history, its elaboration process, hints of its various component growing acquaintances with your senses. Evolutive flavour, bourbon being a complement to a vinous, fruity malt monster. Chewy palate whose rich residual sugars are tamed down by HOTDs classic lively, engaging carbonation. A unique treat that would come across as a gimmick from most other breweries.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Intense nose of apples and applewood, oranges, with notes of whiskey and cedar... something like sticking your head into a freshly made wooden coffin laden with dried fruit and flowers. Sweetish taste but not cloying, backed by a carefu and firm bitterness, rolling into a gentle alcoholic warmth. More of that fruity, flowery perfumery in the backdrop. And aftertaste.

2651,"2009-12-31",4.4,"Rating #2500. 12oz bottle, courtesy of ¾. Thanks, Mike! Pours a murky, oily, deep amber-tinged cola color; very light carbonation and minimal head formation; nice density of color and pleasantly viscous. The aroma on this is very dense and smoky: lots of smoked meats, caramelized brown sugar, and nicely charred barrel notes: wood, light bourbon, slightly warming; this has a huge amount of heft and density to it: highly attenuated, very creamy and viscous, seamless, and lots of smoke and leather. Full mouthfeel: very minimal carbonation here, but it works well for what this is: an enormously dense and chewy, liqueur-like beer with lots of leather, tobacco, and smoked meat notes; hugely complex, very much leather and tobacco dominated; the barrel character provides some toastiness and charred wood notes, along with a light amount of bourbon / liqueur character; beautifully integrated, (again) seamless, creamy and viscous and all kinds of complexity; I was disappointed by Michael, but this is HOTD at its finest all over again: hugely attenuated and developed malt core, perfect barrel presence, and incredibly generous in its notes, striking them clearly: tobacco, wood, smoked meats, light fruitiness, and soft bourbon; absolutely gorgeous, and another masterpiece from Alan Sprints. Ali, who doesnt usually care much for this style of beer, also gave it an unofficial 4.4, and this is why were married.

I always go a little jig when Im doing a new HotD beer because I know Im in for a treat of some kind, and this was no different.  Body is a cherrywood reddish-brown, still body with no head.  A decadent aroma full of maple syrup, rummy raisins, figs, mocha, oak and bourbon.  Flavor was equally divine, with tons of rich caramel, sharp smoke, pungent wood, bourbon, appley....clearly something to be savored in a special time and place.

Nice black color. This beer has a nice viscous pour. Not much carbonation on this thing, except for a few bubbles popping out. You can tell that if you were able to produce a head on this thing it would have a deep dark chocolate head. A lovely aromatic aroma of chocolate and bourbon. The smoke isnt coming out much at first, but as the beer gets a bit warmer I smelling the subtle hints of smoke. Some touches of wood come through in the aroma as well. Just  a very nice deep and complex aroma. I thought this beer was going to be undercarbonated, but it is far from it. The carbonation gives a nice smooth backing to the chocolate and strong bourbon flavor. The bourbon flavor isnt strong to where you get that sour-type bourbon flavor. The smoke comes out more and more as the beer gets warmer, and you being to taste it later on. I can see how there were apples used at some point in the brewing/aging process, because I get a VERY subtle fruit flavor. This beer is awesome and I am very happy to have tried and very satisfied.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

The aroma is fruity, tart (a bit of crushed aspirin maybe), some booze, rich ripe dark cherries and smooth rich malts way in the back. In the taste I get a high level of something I like to call:  holy shit good. That level of goodness is brimming with rich creamy dark fruitiness along with chewy rich malt sweetness. Nice combination. It then gets a somewhat ripe cherry like flavor to go along with additional notes of caramel, dark ripe grapes, molasses and some booze. Yummy, sweet, and full of assertive yummy goodness. Everything I like in a beer.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Beautiful aroma; apple, chocolate, bourbon, chocolate, sour cherry and pear are the predominant aromas, with caramel, dark fruit and smoke in the background. Flavor begins with smoke, peat and chocolate. Apple is more dominant in the aroma than on the palate. Caramel, vanilla, bourbon, alcohol, dark fruit, oak and apple add complexity. Peat, smoke and bourbon stick around for a long finish. Its a bit on the hot side, but otherwise this is delicious.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"

2651,"2009-08-09",3.3,"A - Brown in color with very little head present. There is some lacing though, once you tilt the glass from side to side. The brown is clear though, as you can see a small amount through the glass. Small bubbles are visible along the edge of the glass, but really nothing much to note.

S - Lots of sweetness going on here. Some fruits, sugars, malts all hitting your nose all at once. A big whiff puts the smell in your nostrils for a good amount of time even while the glass is away from your nose. There is some alcohol burn but really not a lot considering the ABV on this beer. 

T - Apples, bourbon, oak, sweet sugars and vanilla. Very little alcohol detected here, which is impressive. A full-creamy finish, very rich. Lack of carbonation takes away from the taste.

M - Medium bodied. Very rich. Pretty much flat, which is disappointing for me.

Lovely aroma of green apple, leather and light tobacco. Some smoke and molasses comes through as well, hanging above the subtle bourbon, chocolate and oak wood character as the base.

Hair of the Dog always has this great smoked malt thing going on with their darker beers.  Some sweet, salty bacon is in the nose too, but is weaved in nicely.  Really sweet and creamy in the mouth.  Smoke picks up the back end nicely.  There are dark, deep choclate elements working here, wrapped in smoke, and lighter, higher notes of light apples.  This is really interesting.  A bit sweeter than I would like., but man, that is a beautiful interplay of flavors.  A bit thinner than I would like, which does not help this beer.

2651,"2009-06-19",4.2,"Rating Number 100!!.  Bottle, with big thanks to NYbeer.  Pour is deep rich-looking brown with hints of red.  Pretty much no head, just a few bubbles around the perimeter.  The moment I opened the bottle I could smell stone fruit and wood in the room.  The aroma is also caramel malt, red and green apple, rock sugar, faint background smoke, and the earthiness and oak tones of pinot noir.  It smells rich.  Flavor is huge up front.  Lots of caramel malt, apple, plum, and date to start.  Then rock sugar kicks in, some raisin in there too.  Finish is continued sweetness with woody notes and a lingering sweet apple flavor.  The bourbon is certainly a background flavor initially, but really intensifies as the beer warms.  Also a hint of smoke and vanilla/bourbon in finish. Alcohol is very well hidden.  This is a sweet beer, it tastes like it has 5 years of age on it already.  I have no idea what a few more years would do, but Im glad I drank it now.

Very thin body, more apple and chocolate, also some bourbon, and this time, the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Maple and burnt brown sugar in the finish.

2651,"2009-06-13",4.6,"12oz bottle courtesy of some very generous Pac NW traders.  Poured into a snifter.

Pours dark mahogany out of the bottle and settles in almost completely black in the glass with hints of amber showing through the edges.  An aggressive pour produces a small bubbly head that forms a solid ring and leaves good lacing.

The aroma takes some time to open up as it warms.  Its generally sweet with the red apple peels being the dominant aroma initially but with some bourbon and vanilla as it warms.  There is sweet caramel as well as hints of smoked malts and chocolate.

The taste is stunning.  Its got so much going on and yet everything comes together in a perfectly balanced package.  There is the initial sweetness of the apple brandy which gives way to the caramel malts of the backbone.  The finish has a touch of sweetness but with a wonderful boozy, smoky finish that just clings to the palate.

The mouthfeel is near perfect.  Its full bodied with minimal soft carbonation and just coats the palate completely.  Absolutely decadent feel.

Well, when you take one of my favorite beers (Adam) and start playing around with it, you start to wonder if they should just not mess with a good thing.  Well, in this case, the end product is a near-perfect beer that has a complexity that is unrivaled by almost anything else out there.  World class.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

2651,"2009-05-24",3.9,"Served lightly chilled around 55ºF / 13ºC
A vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass just produces a fat-one-finger thick, nicely browned, dark tan colored head.  The beer is quite dark, almost black really with perhaps a touch of brown to it.  When held up to the light the beer shows brilliantly clear, deep, dark ruby highlights.  The aroma is quite smoky, phenolic even; the smoke character doesnt have the richness that I associate with beech-wood (Rauchbier) or alder-wood (Alaskan Smoked Porter) smoked beers, instead it is a little thin, though really this might be because the smoke is not nearly at the same level as those other smoked beers.  The smoke here combines with a distinct fruitiness that reminds me of raisins, prunes and even some brandy like notes along with a touch of warming alcohol.  At times the alcohol can be quite noticeable in the aroma, especially after I have started to drink the beer.  The fruit character becomes very rich and interesting if you concentrate on the nose for a bit.  There is also a touch of roast malt character noticeable after a bit as well.  Not a bad nose, but the up front smoke character is a little thin and sharp at times, though it does have a nice underlying richness.

The beer is creamy and viscous feeling with only a faint carbonation that supplies a very soft prickle.  The beer is fairly sweet, which accentuates a dark, concentrated fruitiness, but both of these are offset somewhat by a sharp malt influence.  Roast grain notes provide a burnt-bitterness to the finish, perhaps a touch of acrid notes as well as a touch of burnt acidity.  The smoked malt is a bit fainter than it even was in the nose, but it does provide a subtle smokiness that provides some richness to the beer as well as a hint of sharp smoke phenolics that is just noticeable at times.  The rich fruitiness is the most noticeable part of the flavor; notes of prunes, raisins and roasted berry notes are all quite noticeable.  Subtler fruit notes of caramelized apples, a touch of dates as well as some not so subtle rich, Brandy-like fruitiness.  Alcohol is evident, but donesnt get past supplying a nice warmth and a bit of spiciness.  While rich feeling on the tongue, the beer isnt overly heavy and in fact is a bit more drinkable than might be safe.

For a beer that has a fairly middling aroma to it, the flavor has turned out to be quite nice.  This is definitely a sipping brew and I am really enjoying the rich, concentrated fruitiness here that is just supported by roast malt notes and a hint of smokiness.  After a slow start, this ends up being quite an enjoyable brew.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2651,"2009-05-24",3.7,"Shared by Rciesla I think.  I found this beer to be very enjoyable until the hops take over.  Great malt character with a little bit of smoke.  I think this one will taste dramatically better when the hops start to age out.","Livingston, New Jersey, USA","BrianK"
2651,"2009-05-21",4.4,"Big thanks to Matt (fittingly enough) for hooking me up with this gem.  The one thing that I found most notable was the amount that the apple shined through.

2651,"2009-05-16",3.4,"Pre-DLD tasting: Very dark mahogany brown hue, oily legs and spotty lace. The aroma has notes of fig, molasses, candi sugar, charred wood and ashy smoke, rye bread, and a bit chalky. The taste starts twangy and fruity with an aggressive woody and bourbon tone. Slightly spicy and minerally upon the finish. The acidity seems to be in conflict with the sweeter malts and wood. The mouth feel is oily but sharp aroudn the edges, ashy and chakly finish. This is okay but lacks the depth I expected that some hop character could have provided.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

2651,"2009-05-02",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2016 12 oz bottle big thanks to BrewDad, you are the man! What a treat. Pours a dark brown-near black color with a tiny almost non-existent head even with a vigorous pour. The aroma; well where do I start? Sweet tart apples, alcohol, sweet Belgian candies, rich malts, chocolate. A ton here. The flavor is initially lots of rich chocolates, tons of sugary sweets, apple brandy or some other sweet alcohol, super complex. Interesting and very nice. Complex as hell. Rating number 1200. Re-rate: original 2009 edition. Pours a totally black color with a struggle to form a head, but it cascades for a few seconds to a small beige head. The aroma is rich toffee, tobacco, molasses, dark fruit. The flavor is just an unusual mix of herbal, sugary sweet and smoky flavors, plums, cherries, even some evergreen in this. I certainly see this as a brandy-like brew. The apple from the Eau de Vie barrels is huge and changes the beer totally. Impressive and worthy of high praise. A sipper but drinkable.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2651,"2009-05-01",3.8,"Bottle shared by ygtbsm94 at pre-DLD at Flossmoor.  Medium to thick mouthfeel with a sticky body.  No head, and little carbonation.  The taste was fairly sweet with some caramel and chocolate notes.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"
2651,"2009-05-01",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2011 2009: dark and muddy appearance with deep tobacco and cola brown color.  close to no head but carbonation is present.  nose is heavy banana/trappist yeast esters: overripe and burnt bananas dominate the nose and suggest something like dirty, phenolic weizenbock.  chocolate / raisin / nut malt sweetness, but its difficult to appreciate past the overbearing aged/moldy banana character. medium-full thickness with far too much sugar, leaving it syurpy and cloying.  bourbon?  vanilla?  not really.  smoke?  chocolate?  a little.  creamed bananas?  oh yeah.  objectively speaking its a bit of a mess and comes across as somewhat mediocre.


2009:Draft sample @ Bottleworks was an improvement but not a great one.  less banana, more booze, same body.


2010: bottle at Hair of the Dog.  no head but light to medium carbonation.  none of the browned banana-bomb weizenbock qualities of the 2009.  all of the oak, tobacco, leather, fig and smoke that I expected from the first batch.  probably in the 4.2-4.4 range.  sublime liquid.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2651,"2009-04-30",4.5,"Appearance - This is as dark as its cherry and regular brothers. Very little carbonation, nothing left but a very faint ring around the edge of the glass. Black as a stout. Wow, coats the glass like a thick motor oil like stout as well. I cant wait to taste this monster.

Smell - first couple whiffs are lots of bourbon, vanilla, and green apple. There are some oaky characteristics there as well. 

Taste - Subtle taste of bourbon and vanilla. I dont taste any apple or oak at all. Something about this tastes so much different from all the other bourbon barrel beers I have ever had though, I just cant put my finger on it. The alcohol is present, but not in an overwhelming way. Maybe it is the apple brandy that is playing with my head, never had brandy before. Absolutely delicious beer, wish there was more apple in the taste though, like in the smell. Lots of caramel in the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel - THICK! This coats my mouth in a sublime way; absolutely creamy and smooth. This has to be one of the smoothest beers I have tasted in a long time. 

Drinkability - This is definitely a sipper, and it is not too overly heavy, but it definitely is a high gravity beer. I couldnt see myself drinking more than one bottle of this at a time.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"
2651,"2009-04-27",4.3,"Thanks to whoever brought this one to Flossmoor!  Poured coppery deep brown with very little going on in the head department.  The aroma was huge with cherry dust, sour oak, and rich, almost plummy notes.. picked up a hint of chocolate when digging deeper.. spicy and increasingly oaky on the back where the alcohol singed the nose hairs a bit.  The flavor found thick cherry and plummy notes at the core with caramel and raisins as well.. spicy oak, vanilla, and more cherry surrounded.. hot aftertaste, but in a good way.. delightful!  Sour and warm on the palate with great balance.. low carbonation and an almost syrupy feel.. hit all the right parts of the mouth.  Excellent stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2651,"2009-04-26",5.0,"Bottle from trevor211 - thanks a ton.  I wanted to wait, but this one kept calling my name (and I have another bottle sourced it looks like) so screw it.  This one has a beautiful brownish, murky pour - very reminiscent of Adam.  Aroma is a really nice mix of oak, bourbon, wine, apple, smoke, chocolate and so much else - unreal complexity in the nose alone!  Flavor has a good bit of oak/wet wood with the bourbon being slightly more noticeable than the Apple Brandy.  Smokiness is fantastic here with just enough smoky campfire and a good bit of wood and sweetness.  Some funky cheese here too Theres candy, a multitude of fruits and earth.  Probably the most complex beer Ive sampled.  Crazy good mouthfeel with just a hint of alcoholic heat and just enough sweetness and wood.  This blows away almost all other Wood-based beers as its so well balanced, and Im gonna guess its only gonna get better.  Hypnotizingly awesome, and I dont usually like young HOTDs nearly as much as older ones.  A 5 all the damn way.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

Nice charred smoky sensation as well.  Tobacco, straw notes.  As with the nose, super full and rich.  Palate is heavy medium, mouth coating but not overpowering.

2651,"2009-03-26",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2009 12oz bottle thanks to fogdog for this mindblowingly good beer and for letting me take a sip. We had close to 30 people so I had initially declined to take a sip of this so some that had brought the rarer beers would be assured a taste. Fogdog kindly let me take a quick sip of this, I just wish I had another bottle because I think I probably would have given this even higher if I had been able to focus on the flavors more. Pours a deep brown with a tiny ring of foam and no head. Hugely awesome nose of smoke, leather, chocolate, bourbon, cherry. Its like nosing a fine scotch. The best smelling beer Ive ever had without question. The flavor seemed to be dominated by awesome chocolate, smoke and cherries mixed with raisins. I did not get the apple that some others have mentioned but as I say I only had a sip. Super smooth with no hint of the abv and an silky mouthfeel. Simply outstanding. Alans beers are always a work of art and this is no exception. Not to be missed.

rerate 7/20/09. Finally got my hands on a bottle. We had a rare beer tasting with this, Dark Lord and Dark Horizon Ed. 1 and this won by a wide margin. Even more amazing than I rated it the first time. Huge apple in the nose along with chocolate and leather and a whiff of smokiness. Some light apple up front with massive caramel, dark cherry, some light soy sauce, tobacco and smoke. One of the most complex beers I have ever had. Just amazing.

2651,"2009-03-21",3.8,"12oz bottle. Very enticing aroma... vanilla, sherry, bourbon, toffee and raisins. Some spices... ginger and mint maybe?  Plenty of dark fruits... plums and raisins. Pours a beautiful mahogany/brown with tiny carbonation and a brown film atop. Initial flavor has tons of smoked malt. A lot more than I was expecting. Loads of nutty sherry. Tons of barrel and alcohol presence. Dark fruits, candy sugar. Smoke and maybe a bit of peat. Leather and tobacco. Dry, bitter chocolate. Apple brandy presence is huge upon warming.  Vanilla and caramel. Alcohol presence is definitely there and a bit distracting and especially assertive on the finish. Slick, oily and velvety mouthfeel. Minimal carbonation with a hot, boozy and barrel-tannic finish. Like Cherry Adam... this one needs time. Thanks Levi!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
2651,"2009-03-21",4.8,"This is a very dirty beer. It starts off with hints of faint harsh sweet alcohol and tobacco. It tastes of chocolate, tobacco, charred wood, dark cherry, and lightly smokey bourbon. It has very deep, very complex lingering flavors. More port-like than beer-like. Finishes velvety smooth and delicious in spite of the incredible array of flavors. Some tannins come through for an interesting finish, as if there wasnt enough going on. So much rich port character comes through as it warms.

Second pour: Oak, a hint of chocolate and even a faint hop character. Some spice comes through. Theres now some chipotle dark chocolate spice in the flavor. It still finishes with a silky deliciousness. A friend says its like drinking condensed life.

This is a beautiful, dirty, incredibly interesting beer.  Im really looking forward to trying it again after it has some age on it.","Washington, USA","explosivebeer"

The nose is all over the place, yet entirely drawn together and refined.  Caramel and malted chocolate are steeped with heaps of vanilla and lightly boozy oak, followed by a secondary wave of dark, smoky fruit, rich bourbon, and calvados.  Simply awesome aromas.  Flavors follow suit, a rich choco-caramel-vanilla base just overflowing with dessert-like tendencies, shrouded in contrasting and complimentary bourbon and apple brandy infusions.  Thick, rich, and velvety, theres not a hint of cloying sweetness or overly hot alcoholic presence.  All you get on the palate is a luxurious, lightly warming, melted dessert feeling that is just divine.  This stuff is as sick as advertised.

2651,"2009-03-15",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2009 12oz bottle.  Thanks to explosivebeer.  The beer pours an ugly dark brown/black color with low carbonation though some scant off-white bubbles do swim around and form a tiny rim around the edge.  Fairly muddy looking.  Aroma is mindblowingly complex, probably the most complex beer Ive ever smelled.  Where to start.  Root beer and cola jump out, fresh apple core, white apple flesh, a strong vanilla oakiness and faint milk chocolate.  Smoke creeps out, green apple skin and cocaine.  No bourbon is detected on the nose, though the apple and oak is very prominent.  Just a tad of alcohol present but not at all unwanted.  The way that all of these elements blend together is nothing short of astounding.  As this beer warms it gets even more complex and pleasing, which is scary.

The flavor is even more complex than the nose.  Granny smith apple, rich chocolate, raisin and other dried dark fruits, caramel, caramel covered apples, bourbon (apparent in the flavor though the aroma did not show it), smoke, vanilla.  The way one flavor melds into the next is amazing.  The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, not creamy though it is full and sticky without being cloying.  Huge, neverending finish.  This is just a remarkable beer.  Ive read some say they think its a little hot but I find the alcohol hidden extremely well, especially for an 11.5% ABV recently bottled barrel aged beer.  If anything this seems on the level of a high level Scotch, which it rivals in complexity.  I could sit down with this beer for an hour and pay it complete attention. The only possible complaint I can think of is the phenols from the smoke blend with the apple character to create the aforementioned cocaine character which is slightly undesirable.  Its not a big deal and I figure it will dissipate with some age.  I hope to try this in the future when I think it will be even better than now.

Powerfully dark and dense, more crazy smoke, yet baking chocolate also comes through with raspberry jam and cherry.  Hint of heat at the end.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
2651,"2009-03-07",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2009 This beer could have been of the calibre of a Dave. It has a crescendo of flavors including apple cider, bittersweet chocolate, a touch of smoke, rhubarb, ginger, plum pudding in hard sauce, chestnuts, allspice, nutmeg, pipe tobacco, the list is longer than I can recall. The body is a tad thin to support that orchestra of flavor, but its reasonably soft and silky, and its deftly balanced. My main issue with this beer is an excessive alcoholic heat, which would most likely disappear with a few years of aging, but for right now, said heat makes extended drinking of this flavor monster a bit trying.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"
2651,"2009-03-06",4.4,"12oz. bottle, with an enormous THANKS to bvc for going to all the extra effort to get me the hookup on this!  Pours a muddy dark brown with burgundy highlights and a thin creamy tan head that lasts much longer than expected.  Aroma is smoke, tobacco, peat, chocolate, light bourbon, oak, vanilla, freshly cut fruit, almost a brandy apple, and on and on, all nicely complimentary and well blended with each other.  Theres a crapload going on with the nose on this one and different things seem to come out over time.  Flavor has a similar thing going on, if only to a slightly lesser degree.  Sure nice regardless, with a touch of sweetness on the finish.  I didnt find the alcohol anywhere on this one, and on the flavor the bourbon definitely took a back seat to everything else.  Like all HotD beers Ive tried, this one is a ""mood"" beer.  If everything is just so, and Im in the right mood and can change gears and slow down to really ponder something, man does HotD beer sure work for me.  Fortunately, this is one of those nights.

The aroma boasted a smokey, oakey, malty base, with notes of bourbon and quite a bit of contribution from the apple eau de vie barrels.

2651,"2009-02-26",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2009 Draft at Brouwers on release day. For a lot of us, Wednesday today revolved around balancing work, hitting the sale early, maybe trying to make the tasting with Alan, then getting down to the tapping at Brouwers in the evening.
At the tapping tonight, a table of us all ordered a Matt and a New Belgium Wild. We all started in on the Matt, and eight guys whod like nothing more than to sit and talk about beer all shut up pretty quickly. Everybody there was a homebrewer, everybody there had tons of questions about and insights into the beer, but after a couple sips we were all sitting silent, smiling at our glasses like smitten little schoolboys. Thats worth noting before we get started actually talking about the beer.
It pours nearly black, pretty much ebony with rubied highlights with very light head and virtually no lace. The time in the barrels is certainly evident just from the appearance that way.The nose shows apples with some roast and even campfire poking in around the edges, theres that traditional ale cola note, and maybe some chocolate showing. 
The draft version evidently has more body, more cream, to it than the bottled version. So there may be a slight advantage there. Its hard to say where the flavors start; its hard to pick out which one hits you first. There are roasted apples, dipped in chocolate, smoke still showing on them, a bit of a cherry vanilla note from the bourbon, and then a depth of roast and cola under all that, lending some contrast but mostly stabilizing it.
Absolutely fantastic beer, certainly one of the best Ive had in my young life. 
Looks like I need to add a correction here; Alan posted in the forums to point out that he used some different grains and added candi sugar to the Adam recipe. So, while there are very definite similarities, theyre not the same beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2651,"2009-02-26",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2014 Bottle on release day, sampled at near-room temperature.
Mmmm....wow. Beautiful dark brown pour with very little head, lovely and almost impossibly complex aroma of chocolate and vanilla, the smoke quite subdued in the background. Sweet and full, chocolate flavors layering over sweet bourbon, brandy-like apple filling it out, just outrageously good. Full, rich mouthfeel, sure a touch of alcohol, ahh....its going to age like nobodys business. This one is worthy. 9/4/8/5/18=4.4

5 years old, April 2014.
Almost flat. Rich, thick, milk-chocolately. Aroma is bourbon forward, melding with aged hops. Prominent alcohol, unfortunately. Not sure I really need 12 oz of this -- 6 might be enough. 8/4/8/4/16=4.0. This is a lowball rating, based on my current preference for more drinkable instead of more intense, so Ill split the difference. 

August 2014.
Cellar temperature. Almost flat, as above. Aroma of oak and apple, leather and tobacco, a touch of chocolate, a touch of smoke. Gorgeous flavor, just the right level of sweetness for what it is trying to do(which is pretty high), boozy vanilla, dark fruit (raisin), smoke. The epitome of a strong Hair of the Dog Beer. Viscous and delicious on the tongue. I dont understand why the lowball last April; this is spectacular and Im through the first 6 oz before I know what has happened. This is at least a 4.4. It could go as high as 4.6. The only place it gets dinged is for the palate (too still at this age) but it gets bumped an extra point on flavor to return to 4.4 as originally.
