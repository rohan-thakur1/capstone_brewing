Something a little special for this, the 2500th unique beer I have a record of rating. Prior to this, the only Crooked Stave offerings Id been able to locate were collabs with Epic and Evil Twin. This is a good example of a Flanders Brown, if slightly more emphatically tart on the tongue than typical for authentic versions. (16/20)

Aroma is sour and wood with a touch of funk. I was expecting a more acidic beer, and while it does trend that way a tad, this beer has a pretty nice balance of sour, wild flavors. Theres a lot of sour fruit knocking around. Grapes, blackberries, peaches, cranberries, raspberries, apricots. While the funk is relatively mild, it does contribute and give the beer some depth. Best of all, theres none of that bile note that plagues so many American sours (at least for me). Solid woodiness and bretty funk. The taste has a pretty good acid bite running throughout. Theres some soured maltiness, giving the beer a bit of body. Fairly vinous. A bit harsher than the aroma but it still doesnt go overboard. Quite dry. Light body.

Aroma has a good amount of oak and dry red wine with a nice backing sour berry note that has a touch of acid.

3418,"2013-07-22",3.9,"A- opaque amber brown pour with a quickly dissipating 1/2 finger of light tan head. S- brown sugar, faint molasses, sour bing cherries, some funk, sulfur, light leather, damp oak, musty white grapes, lemon juice. M- quick, medium acidic palate with a mild to medium body with good carbonation. T- tart cherries and lemons to start but it dies off quickly. Brown sugar supports. Vinegar in the middle that lasts through a quick ending. Some unripe green grapes and mineral water in the middle as well. Ending is grape tannins, lemon and vinegar. Simple taste, but not to a fault.

3418,"2013-07-21",3.8,"375 ml bottle from my 2013 Membership. Thanks for the assist, Aaron. Pours a nice brownish copper pour, darker reddish glow, well hazed body with some glowing ruby copper edges and bottom. A frothy tannish head dies to a decent filmy layer, sticks around as a loose film, laces ok. Aromas show tart cherries, balsamic, and a bit of biscuit. Firm oak presence, red wine, a bit of acidity. Good bigger oak, gentle brett grows, a bit funky, some of that toasty biscuity malt base shows a bit. Initial is firm lactic sourness, nothing offensive, nothing acedic. A bit dry lactic sourness shows cherry, red wine, yogurt. Sour and smaller body up front and as we move on. Really kinda nice. Not potent and acedic, but nicely sour, still showing some decent base quality. Middle is a bit dry and tannic, moving on into firm oak, a touch of vanilla, earth, gentle red wine feels. Red grapes come on stronger here and moving forward. Backend shows a bit of spiciness, gentle red wine, and vanilla. Really, oak and lactic elements are firm, more red grape are a touch juicy, tart, and tannic. A smaller body makes this a touch thin overall. But really, quite drinkable. A touch of fuzziness on the palate, big lactic element shows a touch of raspberry, pulpy berry in there somewhere. Really quite clean, cherry fruit, big oak, a bit winey,n with a big lactic presence without being acedic or offensive, no Balsamic or vinergarette feel in the slightest. Its not all that complex, but it is quite tasty. Nose could use a touch more. But this is really a nice quite crushable sour.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

The taste is approachable sour acidic fruit, balanced with general red grape, and then shows some lightly sweet maltiness that wasnt present in the nose.
