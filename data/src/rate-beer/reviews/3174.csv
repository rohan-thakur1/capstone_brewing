Translucent pour with no head - big shock hey?
Nose is lychee, sweet pissy stench, honey.
Taste comprises more lychee, melon balls, grains, lemon piss.
Medium body, still, sweet close.
No fan of this.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
3174,"2017-03-26",0.9,"March 2017 - Bottle share at One Canada Square. Big thanks to Wingman W. As Ozeki Josen Kinkan Sake. Pours like water to form a totally clear liquid with no head, but some legs. Aroma is banana cake, malted milk biscuit, butter biscuit. Body is light and smooth with low carbonation. Taste is booze cut with water, the water rice has been boiled in, starchy and plasticky, parafin with a spicy dry finish. I can drink this and in fairness theres nothing too offensive about it, but theres no pleasure to be had. It is very much a functional beverage, and if someone put it in front of me without telling me what it was I wouldnt guess it was fit for human consumption.

3174,"2017-03-14",3.3,"Bottle shared in London - thanks to Daveo. Pours crystal clear with no colour. A little raw alcohol in the nose, vanilla, white rice. Medium sweet flavour with some further vanilla, more basic white rice, not much else. Medium bodied, a little oily. Finishes with mild boozy warmth, some oily vanilla, white pepper. Enjoyable stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

3174,"2011-05-05",3.3,"900ml ""tetrapak"" bottle brought for the ISHA Pula Conference NDP by our Japanese colleague Takuya (thanks!) This poured a typical clear body tinged with yellow. The nose was quite a shock actually, a distinct note of cocoa appears. It didnt follow into taste at first though. A distinct almost typical for a sake medicinal quality popped up, which I didnt like, but the mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable and later on the medicinal qualities started to vanish and be replaced by the same strange cocoa-like note as before and it actually got enjoyable. Interesting stuff, not bad, even if its a futsu-shu.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
