Aroma is rather fruity with a strong fresh apricot aroma. Some light acidity and a bit of citrus. 
Pours a hazy, golden orange with a medium sized, slightly off white head that is rocky and recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers. Medium light lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with some medium light citrus notes. Moderately strong apricot character, but the apricots are fairly acidic and there is some oak tannins. Some oak in the finish with some lingering acidity, but not much lingering fruit. Light funk.

4442,"2015-03-24",4.1,"Unlabeled bottle (750 m). Shared by Chris, huge thanks!

Appearance: Cloudy yellow with a medium white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Wow! A burst of juicy apricots along light funk, oak, light lemon presence and floral/herbal notes.

Taste: Light to moderate fruity sweetness with a massive juicy apricots presence, mild funk, lemony notes and oak notes. 

Palate: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Juicy. Lingering fruity finish. 

Overall: At the moment, it lacks a bit of funk to be at the same level of the Grrrz Kriek, but Im sure a few months will do miracles for this one. With just a bit more funk, both the depth and drinkability will skyrocket. And its so fruity that it wont fade anytime soon. This Grrrz series from Bullfrog is really eye opening for me as theres nothing close to these beer outside of Belgium. Really good.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
