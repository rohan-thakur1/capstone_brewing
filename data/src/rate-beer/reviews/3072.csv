The nose is intense, with smoked meat, campfire ash and caramel.In the mouth, its quite a singular and very intense experience. A dessert smoked beer? Well we have one here and itÂ’s works. Things begin sweet and sticky, with lots of sweet caramel and toffee. The smoke is noticeable, but sits in the background along with a significant, lingering, almost burnt bitterness. The 9.6% is no surprise here - itÂ’s a big syrupy sipper. The palate is quite oily and there is just the barest hint of carbonation.

Verder ook zoete accenten van karamel en honing, gecombineerd met kruidige accenten van peper en boskruiden. Verder honing, mosterd dille dressing, gerookte zalm, heel apart maar toch perfect in balans! De smaak is zoet en erg rokerig, licht hartige umami tonen, beukenhoutrook, bacon, de moutige zoetheid wordt geaccentueerd door tonen van karamel en honing, daarna een drogere afdronk van houtige tonen en kruiden.

Head is lasting.
Body is medium to dark brown.

Medium to full body, velvety/syrupy texture, lively/soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

The aroma is just completely off the hook.  You thought Schlenkerla was complex, well...this is on entirely different level.  Mind you, this is definitely a slow sipper and quite sweet, but itÂ’s not at all a fatiguing sugar-and-alcohol bomb.

The aroma is not fully appealing, because not only it has the (appreciated) smoke, but also a strange rancid sourness. Strong body, sweet malt and caramel flavor, that would make a good Doppelbock; on top of that, there is the expected strong smoke flavor, sweetness, light malt sourness; it has a respectable bitterness level, and some alcohol warmth. Maybe just too sweet for this combination of smoke and rancidity.Good, but excessive, unelegant.2011-12-09, cask at Ã˜lbaren, Copenhagen, 10% ABV, 8-5-8-4-17=42Hazy mahogany color, with huge compact head.

The body is structured, the mouthfeel is smooth; it has a fat flavor of malt and caramel, quite sweet; the smoke is present but not as strong as the Schlenkerla, or at least itÂ’s hidden by other factors; the alcohol can be perceived; also traces of yeast; the bitterness is quite strong, with some dark caramel too in the final.Very good, but side to side with the Schlenkerla Urbock, this one is rough; big but less elegant.

How: Tap at Ma Che Siete Venuti a FÃ , Rome Italy
The look:  Partly Cloudy golden orange body topped by medium white head
In long:  Nose is very smoky, maybe the most smoky nose I had next to a Schlenkerla.  Here the smoke character is somewhere between wood smoke and smoked ham.  Taste is scarily smooth for a near 10% brew.  A lot of toasted cereals, flavor of bread crust. a lot of smoke and a lot of refreshing tropical fruits.  Alcohol is a bit apparent and that is the only thing I find wrong with this beer.  The blend of extreme smokiness and refreshing fruit character is just unreal. Schlenkerla has competition.  It is unfortunate that it is a bit too boozy for its own good.  Make it 7% and this is a masterpiece.  Boozed-up, totally smoked, can only be found in a pub.  Reminds me of myself some years ago.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
