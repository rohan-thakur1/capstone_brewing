165,"2017-02-26",3.8,"Pour on tap at the brewery, dark reddish black pour with tan head, aroma brought notes of cocoa, caramel, toffee, nice pine and spicy hops as well into a bit of earth. Taste was a mix of caramel, cocoa, roast into some pine, grass, touch of spice with more cocoa, finishing dry, bitter.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
165,"2015-11-12",4.1,"Aroma is graham cracker, cocoa, biscuits and coffee. Draft pour at Moxee. Black with a ton of foamy and creamy off white head. Taste is tobacco, leather, malts, cream, cocoa and coffee. Fantastic beer","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
165,"2015-08-26",3.6,"Draft to pint. Looks good; a lightly translucent dark cola with foamy beige head. Smells and tastes like a Black IPA; dark malt, bitter and piney hops, and a bit of toastiness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Enjoyable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
165,"2015-08-23",3.6,"On tap at the Pint Room. Dark brown pour with a thin tan head. Smoky roasted malt, mild hops and toffee in the taste and aroma. A good, but not outstanding porter.","Bellaire, Michigan, USA","bpar73"
165,"2015-08-16",4.1,"On tap at 3 Floyds. Pours near black with a thick tan head and a treacle aroma. There is a hearty dark molasses and smoked malt flavor with a bitter slightly carbonated finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
165,"2015-08-10",3.6,"This was good porter with a nice balance and sessionable qualities. Dark but not overly strong. The darker malts were complimented well by a little more hop bitterness.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Block"
165,"2015-08-09",3.5,"Pint at the brew pub. Black body. Thin light tan head. Light, yet creamy body. Taste is an abundance of fruity hops. Which actually balances quite well with with sweet toasty malts. Classic 3 Floyds - hop a beer that doesnt normally get hopped mentality. Yet seems restrained by todays standards. What this really reminded me of was a handful of black IPAs brewed circa 2011, before everyone got obsessed with rye malt and ruined the style.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
165,"2015-08-08",4.5,"Precious Three Floyds at The Pint Room in Carmel, IN. Poured in to a tester.

Look - Dark yellow-brown. Good ivory to tan head on tester glass. A lot of lacing. Head does settle to nothing.

Smell - Dank hop. Chocolate. Char. Berry.

Taste - Very hoppy as advertised. Chocolate. Bubblegum. Bready malt. Charred. Lemon. Citrus finish.

Feel - Chewy. Medium. Very carbonated. Bitterness on tongue.

Overall - Chocolate bubblegum hoppy porter. As close to a black IPA as you can get. I see why this was brought out of retirement. Floyds roots.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"
165,"2015-08-03",4.0,"On tap at FFF. Pours thick unclear dark black coffee with a creamy and lacy light cocoa colored head. Aroma is lighter roasted and toasted malts. Brings delicious flavors of roasted malts followed gently by the softer piney hops balancing in a creamy body.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

165,"2006-03-04",4.3,".   I drank this beer as I took my headphone tour of the brewery.  It filled the glass with a black solution that rested under a thick creamy chocolate head.  The aroma was a sensation of chocolate, roasted grain, vanilla, coffee, and cocoa.  This beer introduced itself in a thick smooth manner with the taste of chocolate, toffee, coffee, roasted grain, and vanilla.  I took a growler home and when tasting it again after drinking another oatmeal stout I detected a hint of smoke lingering in the background.  I always keep my fingers crossed that when I make it back to Three Floyds brewery I will be able to get another growler.","Champaign, Illinois, USA","RooftopRogue"
165,"2004-12-20",4.0,"On tap at the brewery.  Dark beer with a lugubrious brown foam ring in the glass with an attractive oil slick in the middle.  Enticing coffee nose.  Very smooth mouthfeel, with lots of coffee, chocolate, cherry and dried fruit, with even a hint of smoke.  Very nice beer.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
165,"2004-12-05",3.9,"Homebottled, thanks TAR&CB.  Black color looks like and Imperial Stout.  Aroma is mostly roast, coffeeish, burnt, a bit of vanilla, malty sweetness.  Flavor is somewhat smokey and sweet.  Full bodied(very thick for the style).  Balanced finish with the hops coming through up front and the roast malt bitterness working against the sweet carmelly favor at the finish.  Well Done.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
165,"2004-11-28",3.5,"Tap.  Very nicely done stout.  Deep opaque color.  Brownish head.  Full bodied and smooth.  Huge roasted malt and coffee flavors and aroma.  Well balanced and flavorful.","Alabama, USA","11026"
165,"2004-11-25",4.1,"Draft: Opaque black. Gorgeous, microscopic-bubbled mocha foam. Saliva-inducing aroma of buttery espresso, candle wax, shoe polish, and fudge. Remarkably rounded roastiness with hints of vanilla beans, coffee, and rich char. Lushly creamy on the palate, but lightly prickly, as well. Gushing burst of rounded roast suffuses into a rich espresso background, quieting the twangy aspects of the roast. Inky and extremely oily with notes of tar. Fresh vanilla bean underpinnings add more softness to the oily body while highlighting the sumptuous char astringency. Snappy phenolic flash briefly lessens the richness, making room for a  boisterous Chocolate malt onset laden with a steady flurry of roast. Esters and earthy hops remain a mere afterthought to the malt immensity. Finishes with licorice and moist chocolate cake flavors and lingering roasty remnants. If youd be so lucky to find this on cask, you must think youre   in heaven.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
165,"2004-11-19",3.9,"Pint at the brewery and growler-Im not a huge fan of sweet/oatmeal stouts (this one is some of both I believe)but damn nice beer.  Great body, lots of chocolate, coffee, and certainly some hops too.  This would be a nice compliment to their other beers if they decided to brew it more often for distribution.","Glen Ellyn, Illinois, USA","HopasaurusRex"

Nice subtle sweetness and roasted malt flavors and surprisingly not as many hops as I had expected.  A nice oatmeal stout, but I think its over-rated.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

165,"2004-09-13",4.1,"Delivered via the magical medium of growler, my precious...
Solid blackness is the color, no light escaping this thing, and its impressively capped with a sturdy inch of creamy, toasted tan froth which leisurely nestles into a more modest size...gorgeous nose, highly roasted, barely bitter burnt toast notes, a whisper of espresso, hint of maple and anise and black pepper...not huge, but still complex, though delicate in volume...now to taste, already...smooth, mellow, milky and pleasant. If I could say it all in four words, that would do, but grant me indulgence to go further, please...tiny bitterness up front, replaced swiftly with a sweeter character, a trace of cocoa, but creamy all the way...feels more like a milk stout, than an oatmeal. Mouthfeel gets a little slick, but it rings the palate with gladness. Body is medium, finish sweet and mild. Very easy drinkability here, no struggle at all. I could get comfortable with this one, thats for sure. 
Precious is a sweet thing, black gold, and is its own reward.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

165,"2004-08-19",3.8,"Great Taste.  This wasnt my first choice but it was all they had left.  Coffee black in color with a brown head.  Aroma of roasted & sweet chocolate.  Perhaps tyhe creamiest stout Ive ever had, smooth and chocolatey with roasted undertones.  This went down way to quickly, I would have enjoyed more.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","redmosquito"

165,"2004-07-09",4.1,"Typical stout appearance with a black body and a brown head. Aroma is roasted and toffee-like. The flavor really surprised me on this one; very maly complex in place of the typical 3F over-hopping. Roasted flavor with hints of toffee, chocolate, and coffee. A slight acidic zing in the end.

165,"2004-07-05",3.8,"Thanks To Dick Vandyke for lugging Growlers to the Southside Beer Expo!!!

165,"2004-06-30",4.1,"Thick black liquid flows from the growler: wonderful dark chocolate head, even a bit of caramel lacing. . .burnt toast aroma with undertones of pine and surrounded by heavy coffee and mocha.  Full bitter roasted flavour has a subtle hop belly that is characteristic of Three Floyds, but only slightly noticeable.  Finish is perfectly roasted to accentuate that wonderful chocolate malts.  Great to see the guys in Munster brewing a fabulous beer where the hops are second to the strong malts","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
165,"2004-06-27",4.1,"Thick and black with no light passing through and a thick, tan persistent head.  Very roasted aroma full of coffee, toasted bread, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and whole grains.  The body is very smooth and creamy with a great mouthfeel.  The flavor is delicately balanced and wonderfully tasty.  The sweet caramel and chocolate is contrasted against the roasted malts and light hops.  Its great to see FFF release a beer that isnt dominated by a huge hop profile.  The big, roasted malts play a more important role and really shine through.  A wonderfully drinkable smooth stout.  Excellent.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
165,"2004-06-26",3.8,"Sampled at the Southside Beer Expo. Very good and yet just a little different from the style. Thed dark roasty malt is very prominent, yet its mouthfeel is very light and dry, like a session stout. I suspect the hop bill is in the usualy ""Not Norrmal"" vein, and thats what makes the difference. Be sure to grab a few of these, itll probably be mostly on tap at bars serving 3F.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
165,"2004-06-26",3.6,"This like a porter and a similar taste too.  Everyone raves about this new brew, but it did not live up to the ultra hype.  It was good with a nice balance, but it really didnt ring ""3 floyds"" to me.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

The taste starts out malty sweet, with a nice light hop finish. Powerful for a stout in flavor.","Rochester, New York, USA","cherr"
165,"2004-06-13",4.0,"Cool, first to rate this great beer. Had it at the brewery and served by Nick Floyd. Very cool. The beer is dark black with a medium and medium lasting tan head. The nose is malty up front with some coffie and chocolate. The taste is just the same with a very strong and bitter push. Almost drying and smoothe at the same time. WIth being so (well, its not THAT bitter) bitter I expected a more chalky feel to it, but it is not. Kind of has  a viscous feel to it, but not in a gross way.
