2442,"2017-05-09",4.1,"Il es doré et brillant ce cidre. Ça sent la pomme bien mûre, le caramel écossais et le verger en fleurs. Des saveurs poivrées par-dessus dautres de tarte aux pommes. Des douceurs acidulées titillent le palais et une texture sirupeuse, presque visqueuse étend les particularités gustatives de ce liquide dune bonne couche quasi permanente partout à lintérieur de la bouche. Une dégustation satisfaisante. (2181-080517)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"
2442,"2016-12-01",4.0,"375 ml bottle from the Party Source. 2012 vintage. Pours a clear darkish gold with no head but some decent legs in the glass. The aroma is sweet but clean compared to the flavor. The flavor is very sweet, with loads of sweet buttery apple, caramel, boozy warmth, and some spices late. As it warms, its sweeter at the end and the spice is mostly gone. Full-bodied, with a sweet, chewy mouthfeel and subtle tang. Not the most unique take on the style but as an up-the-middle one goes, this is very nice.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Poured at Shelton Fest. Golden color in a snifter. Big apple, peach, nectarine, and candy aroma like a desert room at Berns.

2442,"2015-06-13",4.0,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml) 2010 vintage. 

Appearance: Clear bright golden with small light alcohol legs. 

Aroma: Quite peachy with apple flresh, vanilla, honeyed notes and light spiciness.

Taste: Medium to heavy sweetness well balanced by a moderate acidity. Cooked apples along caramel, cinnamon, vanilla and honeyed notes.

Palate: Full body. Rather thick and oily mouthfeel. Caramel, cooked apples and peachy finish. A bit of cinnamon as well. Warming.

Overall: Textbook ice cider. Nothing really stands out, but theres definitely some complexity (peaches along apples and a few other flavors), a good balance between sweetness and acidity and a thick and consistent body so its definitely enjoyable.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2442,"2009-08-19",3.9,"Bottle (375ml - clear & corked).  Shared with garthicus.  A typical ice cider pour - bright, clear, somewhat oily-looking gold, a tiny bit of froth for a head, some bubbling - looks thick.  Pungent acidic apple aroma, moderate alcohol, a bit of bitterness, almost a hint of burnt sugar and appleseed.  The taste - very, very good, but a little jagged around the edges - tart apple plus seeds plus a bit of spiciness, with the alcohol coming through in the finish.  Thick, slick, acidic, nice long presence on the palate, leaves a pleasant after-tingle.  Very good, but its certainly no Frimas.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Oily yet not so thick palate, very good stuff, more subtleties than most beside the straightforward apple richness.

2442,"2005-02-21",4.1,"Golden and viscous, similar to a sweet dessert wine from the Jurancon region of France, a relative unknown compared to his more exuberant and expensive cousin Sauternes.   Crisp green apple aroma to start, with a little appleseed bite and faint residual alcohol finish.  A tad more acidic than most ice ciders Ive had a chance to get to know, but I wouldnt consider it a flaw, because its the astringency that balances off the powerful sweetness to make this unique Québecois product so easy to drink.  Even though the alcohol takes a bit more space as it warms (recommended serving temp is ~4 - 8°C), I can totally taste some maple sugar in this one, and can even feel it in the texture.  It reminds me of ""tire dérable"", which is maple syrup boiled over to a thicker consistency and traditionally drizzled on clean snow, and scooped up with a popsicle stick and licked like a lollipop.
