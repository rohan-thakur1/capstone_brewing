4045,"2016-03-07",4.1,"Growler (1 L) at tasting. Thanks to JulienHuxley for this one! Milky yellow with a small bubbly white head leaving little lacing. Aroma, like many Trillium, is super garlicky and dank with resinous notes, mild citrus and fresh cereals. Taste is also super dank and garlicky with melons, lean maltiness, citrusy notes and mild resinous bitterness. Medium body. Soft carbonation. A bit oily but with a fluffy-ample impression. Dry and garlicky finish. Another delightful hoppy from Trillium with the distinct garlicky and dank house signature. Super easy drinking and quenching. Loved it.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Goût de houblon résineux, pomélo, bonne amertume, zeste dagrumes. Carbonatation moyenne, corps moyen.","Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Whatup14"
4045,"2016-03-05",3.7,"Belle robe pâle et mousse fondante. Herbe, lime, orange et aiguilles de pin, paille et céréales sont des éléments que captent mes narines. En bouche, le choc houblonné est moins percutant. Tout est là mais tout est moins bavard. Au palais, le liquide est plutôt mince et même un peu aqueux en texture. En finale, cest acidulé et épicé. Facile à boire.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
4045,"2016-03-05",4.2,"growler from julienhuxley, thanks dude! almost cloudy light golden pour with a small white cap offering some retention and lacing. onion, garlic, bright and fragrant citrus, soft pine and resin, peach and melon fruitiness, tropical fruits as well, lean spicy maltiness, clean yeast action. moderate carbonation, light body, smooth and balanced tropical-citrusy-garlicy finish. excellent apa.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"

4045,"2016-02-19",4.2,"Hazy golden body with a medium to large white head that leaves nice lacing behind. Juicy, classic citrus notes give way to some herbal and tropical fruit characteristics. Light, slightly doughy malt base provides a soft crushable backdrop for the hop-forward profile. Moderate to soft carbonation, lively bitterness, and a refreshing finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
4045,"2016-02-14",4.0,"32oz growler in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma of strong fruity and citrusy hops, some pale malts, and light dough. Flavor the same with a great hoppiness. Average texture. A very good and flavorful beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"

4045,"2015-05-10",4.4,"Wow this is goddamn phenomenal. growler to tulip is hazy golden straw colored with fluffy white head. Aroma is out of this world juicy grapefruit, mango, lime, and pear. taste doesnt quite live up to that ridiculous aroma but its still great. mild bitterness with tropical fruity sweetness that finishes dry. This brewery really destroys it with these lower abv pale ales. i want gallons of this.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
4045,"2015-05-08",3.3,"Pours hazy light gold into a tulip. Bright white head with medium retention recedes leaving slight sheets. Bread, earthy leaves and funky yeast aromas. Soft with caramel, grilled meat, and earthy yeast front to back. Dry vegetal finish. This is a strange one...glad others are enjoying it...","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
4045,"2015-05-03",4.5,"Spot on example of the new style APA/IPAs coming out of New England. Hugely aromatic, light, clean, slightly mineral malt profile. Huge tropical fruit notes. This one is straight papaya, with candied lemon, pineapple and light cantaloupe. Finish is dry and just slightly bitter. What sets these beers apart is just how delicate they are. Theyre not just throwing tons of hops in a beer, theyre brewing with finesse. It really doesnt get better than this.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
4045,"2014-07-09",4.1,"Pours a vibrant dark brown with an off white lacing. The aroma is citrus and tropical fruit forward with back notes of pine and resin.","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
4045,"2014-07-02",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2016 On tap at the Tip Tap Room, Boston. Pours a hazy light golden and is topped by a medium white head that leaves really nice lacing on the glass. Nose is of fruits, pine and feels really juicy overall. Taste is bitter to a medium level, offers some nice pine notes along with some fruits and fresh cereals. Carbonation was medium-high and mouthfeel slightly juicy. Finish was floral x spicy and nice. A nice way to start with Trillium, I need to sample more from these guys!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
4045,"2014-06-24",4.3,"Orange/gold hazy body with a huge white head that fades away quickly. The aroma is great, unlike with the Fort Point Pale Ale theres some diversity beyond citrus. Orange and grapefruit dominate unsurprisingly, but there is weed and pine coming in as well. This continues over into the flavor, along with some really interesting malt presence to make this about more than just the hops. Spicy rye with some whole wheat bread. Hops are still the main attraction though, with grassy flavors joining the citrus/pine/weed in the aroma. On the tongue its got a medium body with some graininess that leads to a dry finish. FPPA is slightly better, but this is great!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"
4045,"2014-06-24",3.3,"Bottleshare in Asheville. Hazy gold pour with a small head. Honeyed orange, some tea cake and dark fruits. Maple bar. The taste is of orange peel, more honeyed grain. Mildly spicy, woody. Dirt-covered hop accents. Medium body, soft carbonation.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4045,"2014-02-27",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2016 Draught at Deep Ellum, 2/21/14Very hazy pour, even worse than the fort point I had. Deep golden with very light amber tints and, at least, a mountainous, very well-retained white head.Nose is similar to Fort Point, though not as expressive and a little more straightforward with the citrus. Perhaps a touch more pine in there but no alcohol. A bit of doughiness and some other strange notes (almost a hickory nut-like lime-sugariness). Medium to medium high strength of aroma. No alcohol noted.At first sip, its a little muddled thanks to all the sediment. The hops certainly come forward, adding plentiful dry orange rind and lots of white grapefruit bitterness. Grows more acidic on the palate until the malts take over towards the end, adding simple sugar and honey like notes. As it warms the malts continue to pour forth really sweetening things. An odd, almost bittersweet lime-like note works its way in leaving a slightly unclean feel. By the end of the glass, its too sweet for my taste, albeit not horribly so. Very ""thick"" texture, medium to medium-full bodied.Theres certainly a fine line between over and under producing a beer. In a very good example, this was certainly under produced (ie. it seems like it came off secondary too quickly and was just thrown in to kegs in a very rustic, unfiltered/unfined state) while the Mayflower Rye that my friend had was overproduced, being ultra clear and having a hard, almost lifeless/industrial feel to it from the over-filtration.  6/4/6/3/12Growler filled 2/3/16 and drunk 2/7/16.Well, this certainly is different than the previous experience.  Gloriously hoppy, clean fresh and stunningly drinkable.  Obviously Trillium has come a long way since I last rated this.  One of their more dry, crisp, yet still flavorful and hoppy pales.  Always the biggest fan of their low gravity pale ales and this is no exception.  Right up there with Pocket Pigeon (and I assume on par with Skimpy Sparrow, though I missed it).  Rating is for this version.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4045,"2014-02-16",3.9,"Growler shared on the Thursday Night Beer Fart Dungeon-Aloft at RBWG. Pours a cloudy gold with a finger of white head. Notes of tangerine citrus, pine, pale malts, straw, grass, maybe also some lemon citrus. Light-bodied, with a dry mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Nice, clean, hoppy pale ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

>> Thank you Leighton for this APA beast. Nose is incredibly fresh sourdough, dank herbal hops, buttermilk biscuit, fresh pizza crust style farmy grist. Taste brings a fresh malt biscuit body, bright crust. Quenching, bright, just an amazing example of APA on grain and hops fronts. Serious APA skills here that will launch this brewery into the top.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
4045,"2014-02-12",3.8,"Growler at RBWG, thanks. Pours a clear gold that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of citrus with growing pine and grass as well as a light bread backing. Flavor is similar with a nice light citrus and grass combination backed by a light bread note.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

4045,"2014-02-05",4.1,"Growler at home in Salisbury. One day old! Pours hazy gold with a foamy white head. Lovely, inviting aroma, full of pithy tangerine, orange rind, faint grass. Light sweet flavor with mild pale malt sweetness, hints of grain, pine needles, lightly bitter orange rind, tangerine pith. Light bodied with fine to average, massaging carbonation. Lightly drying to finish with loads more citrus pith, tangerine, lemon rind, mild hay and grass. Lovely beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
