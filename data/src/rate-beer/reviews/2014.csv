2014,"2015-03-04",4.1,"Growler thanks to Adam during RBWG. Pours a cloudy brown with small beige head. The aroma is chocolate chip and maple syrup. Similar flavor to nose with cocoa and sweet vanilla, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
2014,"2014-08-05",3.4,"Cask at Fools Gold with Andrew and Ellen. Pours a deep dark brownish body with no head. Aroma is sweet, doughy, cocoa and chocolatey. Mouthfeel is thin with notes of chocolate and malt. Super light and tame. Maybe some ""syrup"" character but this one didnt really do it for me.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2014,"2014-08-05",4.2,"Cask. Dark brown pour with tan head. Chocolate, dark sweet malts aromas. Drinking chocolate chop pancakes for real.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"

2014,"2013-11-25",3.9,"Bottle at Tony/Jim BA Birthday Extravaganza 2013 (Western Springs, IL). Pours a nice deep brownish hue, darker with firmer haze, mellow orange copper glow. Some gentle haziness on the edges is a bit brighter, frothy offwhite head atop laces small. Aromas are a bit biscuity, sweet, toiches of cocoa and mellow sweeter bread. Some gentle vanilla, more cocoa, and biscuit. Firmer cocoa chip element grows as it settles. Initial is medium bodied, subtle maple and touches of brown malt, toast, and dark cocoa. Middle has a gentle body, toast, mellow vanilla, more dry cocoa nibs. Some gentle sweetness, that pancake feel definitely becomes evident. Backend is a bit dry, toasty, and roasty. Nice cocoa presence, mellow swetness, the brown malt fades out. Finish is a touch roasty, gentle cocoa nib turns into a good element, a touch roasty, dry. Nice damn stuff. This really works and has a powerful nib presence.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2014,"2013-06-25",3.9,"Growler... RBWG 2013 Brown pour with a small, creamy, off-white head. This beer smells like chocolate chip pancake batter, accompanied by a lot of vanilla and just a touch of maple syrup. Light to medium-bodied with gentle carbonation. The flavor offers heaps of chocolate and vanilla notes, but is a bit thin. Finishes minerally and rather flat, but is redeemed by a lingering vanilla aftertaste. Growler generously shared by burg326!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2014,"2013-05-11",4.0,"Huge thanks to burg326 for sharing this with me not once, but twice!  Cheers, Adam!  Growlers.  Pours a hazy maduro brown color with a white head.  Nose is a freaking chocolate chip pancake- chocolate, some sweet bread, some sugar, and some mild earthy cocoa notes.  Flavor is similar with chocolate chips, sugar, some earthy cocoa, and sugar.  Light in body and well executed.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
2014,"2013-05-02",4.1,"Growler from JW! Murky brown pour, light brown head.  Sweet flavor and I will be damned if this really doesnt taste like chocolate chip pancakes.  Malty, bready, cake, light maple, chocolate, brown sugar.  Fun stuff!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

2014,"2013-03-01",2.6,"From growler shared by Adam at RBWG.  Thanks for the concept tick!   Pours dark amber with no head.  Nose is super sugary maple syrup, light cocoa, sweet dough.  Flavor is similar.  I dont like chocolate chip pancakes on their own.  I usually prefer my pancakes savory with lots of butter to being slathered in syrup and cant  everytime i see kids and adults eating sweeter chocolate chip and m&m pancakes I think about how diabetes is such a problem for many people in America.  But, I digress.  This beer was gross to me.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
2014,"2013-03-01",3.7,"Growler shared at RBWG! Pours a clear copper with thin tan head and light lacing. Aroma of maple syrup, bready grains, and a hint of chocolate. Taste follows suit, pretty spot on for the name, I am impressed. Good stuff, thanks burg326!","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
2014,"2013-02-28",3.4,"Flip-top growler at RBWG Grand Tasting thanks to burg326. Thank you! Clear, amber pour. Okay head formation. Nose is buttery pancake, maple syrup, muted chocolate. Really rich and spot on like a Funky Buddha beer. Taste is moderate butter, sweet maple, more pancake. Thin but clean body. Wasnt really my think, but I think almost everyone loved this beer including my fiancee.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2014,"2013-02-24",4.0,"2/23/13. Big props to burg326 for sharing during RBWG - one of many things he popped! My goal now is to beat him in FL ticks. Watch out. Ill be seeking out EVERY local beer and hitting EVERY local release from here on out... so anyway, about that beer... Nice brown pour with a solid tan head that sticks. Crazy aroma with plenty of maple syrup, nice bready maltiness, and even a dose of chocolate. The flavor follows suit with a nice combination of malt, chocolate, and maple. Tasty!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
2014,"2013-02-23",4.2,"Swing top to taster at the RBWG Grand Tasting (BIG ups to burg326). Looks good; a semi-transparent caramel orange with off-white lacing. Smells B.O.M.B.; just like the name suggests. Tastes like it smells, but slightly less pronounced. Good on the palate. This is outstanding beer!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2014,"2013-02-23",4.1,"Golden pour with no head. Aroma of maple syrup and chocolate. Rich sweet chocolate, maple syrup, and a hinto light bitter at the end. Really like eating pancakes with watery maple syrup.","decatur, Tennessee, USA","decaturstevo"
2014,"2013-02-18",4.1,"Huge thanks to my boss who opened this growler even though he knew I have 2 saved for the RBWG and some big event in Tampa March 9th.  Poured a nice murky brown color with huge aromas of maple syrup, chocolate, light vanilla, and cake.  How did they get this smell?  Flavors follow suit maple syrup, cake, chocolate chips, and light malt.  Wow this was a great beer, please make more so I can drink with breakfeast.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2014,"2013-02-12",4.0,"This thing is killer! Sample pour of relatively dark liquid with a short finger head. Nose is all breakfast items! Maple and coffee, chocolate chips and smoothness. Flavor is healthy coffee and some sweetness up front with a mild chocolate finish. Really enjoyable...","Florida, USA","tricyclist"
