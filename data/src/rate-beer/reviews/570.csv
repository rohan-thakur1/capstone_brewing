570,"2015-09-18",3.5,"Poured into a snifter.

3.5 A: Deep amber brown color. Didnt get much of a head, but thats partially due to me pouring it too cold. The small head that did form was a frothy beige.

4.0 S: Not a whole lot of beers work well with the brandy barrel treatment, but this is one of them. Vinous grape enters seamlessly with raisin, dates, prunes, currants, and plums from the base. Caramel maltiness with toastiness, toffee, and a light peppery spiciness. Oak and vanilla. Very nice here.

4.0 T: Taste is like the nose, except it may be even more vibrant. Plum and grape intertwine with caramel and toasty malts. Dates, raisins, prune, currants fall underneath. Again not a whole lot of spice, but enough pepper to give it some complexity. Oak and vanilla on finish.

3.5 M: Lighter medium to medium body. The carbonation level is fine, but it could be a bit spritzier. Still, super smooth.

3.75 D: Very good barrel effort here. Barrel flavors complement the base beers flavors quite well.
