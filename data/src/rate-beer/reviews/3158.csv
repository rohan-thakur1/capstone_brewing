3158,"2017-06-01",4.2,"Bottle as part of a JK tasting. Having this as part of a Jester King fruited sour tasting made two things clear: 1) JK knows how to build a beautiful wild, sour beer, since all of their barrel aged stuff has a great combination of barnyard funk and a sharp acidic bite, and 2) this has to be their best fruited sour. The cherries balance the tartness extremely well, allowing both flavors to come through before hitting a nice, drying balance. Theres also a nice, earthy cherry flavor that really cuts through; its never sweet, but its very prominent and it goes well with the rest of the beer. Theres a lot of flavor in this, and its expertly pulled off.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3158,"2016-10-30",4.4,"Batch 1 bottled Jan 2014, drunk 10/10/16.Lovely cherry pulp-beige-golden body is topped by a small, but dense, pink-flecked head. High clarity leaving plentiful sediment behind.The plaster just pours forth from this thing. Incredibly cleanly-fermented and lagered with no rough edges or messy esters. Even the cherries, still very apparent, hold mostly skin and pit characteristics, with very little malic acidity. Soft, vanilla-honey-tinged malts seem to be quite well-attenuated from the nose. Wheat-like character is present as well. Very elegant brett notes add very light band aid, soft guava-lemon and there is just a hint of gentle lactic acid on the end, mixing with the deep, rich, yet understated cherry character. No alcohol or flaw.Just as breathtaking in the mouth, with even, mellow cherry notes that are nonetheless still very bright and flavorful, especially at 33 months of age...Soft, yet malty, but exquisitely dry with soft, biscuity malt and wheat notes and very fine carbonation. A pinch of lactic acid underscores the cherry and lightly tart brett acids. Mild funk, light band aid and black pepper. Incredibly drinkable and hard to believe its even 6.7% abv. The only thing I could think to possibly complain about here is that its, perhaps, TOO clean and mild. Maybe some more funk would do it nicely, I guess? I dont know, this is pretty divine.

The pour is a bright red color with a light pink head that falls down quickly leaving no lace. This is sour as hell. The cherry just bursts right out of it. Its got a strong funk, light oak, and a ton of sour cherry. Its clean, to the point. The flavor is much of the same. There is a blast of sour cherry right up front, and slowly the oak and a light vanilla come in. There is a hint of sweetness before the back end, but its well done. The mouth feel is excellent. Tart, crisp, light, with a great carbonation and a puckering sour cherry on the finish. My mouth waters as I finish this, and I want to keep drinking it!

3158,"2016-09-12",4.0,"Pours a hazed ruby red color with no head at all.

Smells of acetic, unripe wild cherries with a gentle funkiness to em, which allows a riper, sweeter fruit quality to unfold on the nose as well, adding to the beers prominent tartness, with an earthy stone pit quality. 

Has a higher, well fitting carbonation, with a light, very refreshing and challenging, complex body.

Tastes of sweet cherries right from the beginning, which turn more sour the longer they remain on the palate. This is due to a sparkly, stony mineral uprising, as well as an uncompromising acetic tartness, which almost swallows the cherry complexity as for its dry and pungent impact. Finishes with more funk, leather, dried hay and old mushrooms among grilled cherry stones, an opposing crispness resulting from white lemon zest and a late but taste defining sweetness of sun ripened cherries.

Wow, this is a great gateway sour between classic Lambics and AWAs. It certainly got a higher acetic level than its belgian counterparts, while it sucessfully lends an unexperienced sweetness to the cherries, like adding salt to caramel, just to emphasize its sweet qualities. It manages to appear naturally with a very silk mid palate and finish, which brings many well desired funky and tart nuances to light, complimenting to the refreshing cherry fruitiness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The flavor is tart & cherry forward. Its oaky with a nice lever of sourness... again the play on tart cherries and pie cherries is a thing here. I know almost nothing about the two cherry varieties here, but if theyre trying to play a tart cherry against a sweet cherry theyre doing a great job of representing that. The beer has a mild bitterness & is lightly nutty. Its satisfyingly dry for sure.

Lightly fruity in the nose but not a lot of cherry per se. Taste is initially very tart and puckering. With some cherry on the flavor, slight tannins. Pretty solid but could use some more cherry, but my taster has been off lately too. Cherry comes thru more as it warms. Some slight wood as well.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

3/21/2013: At Jesterking with Justin, Patrick, and Joe Mike. Pours ruby red light. Aroma is very nice funky cherry perfect. Taste is complex subtle cherries, that JK sour funk, greatness.
