398,"2015-04-17",3.3,"Cream ales have been around for almost a century now, but the original North American examples almost never reached continental Europe and the style still remains largely unknown here, so I had to resort to this one to get to know it; since its Mikkeller, Im far from sure this is representative for the style. Anyway, from what I heard this is a very unambitious beer style, trying to emulate the pale lager style from a top-fermented viewpoint, not unlike the ordinary blondes in Belgium. Misty peach blonde colour under a medium but breaking, off-white, milky head; the head becomes more dense and moussy with deposit, and the colour deepens as well, to a cloudy orangey blonde. Aroma of gooseberries, freshly cut cucumber, straw, unripe peach, green apple peel almost as in a Duvel, white bread, grass and sorrel (acetaldehyde, probably), very vague hint of lemon peel or even white vinegar, touch of iron but not disturbing, bakers yeast and a very subtle apricot or pineapple sweetishness; just a little bit phenolic too. Crisp onset, fairly highly carbonated which I assume is the intention, restrained but still interesting and persisting sourish fruitiness (green apple, unripe pear, berries), smooth and medium body, pouring away easily, dry and a bit minerally with nevertheless a lightly bready pale malt sweetishness underlying, spicy Belgian yeastiness (which I assume is not typical at all for the style) increasing in the finish, somewhat chalky, with a medium, grassy and leafy, deep and medium long hop bitterishness, even turning piney and resinous to a certain degree, lingering along with a residue of the pale malts. In all: I unfortunately have no other cream ale to compare this with, but if I got it right, this is more yeasty and estery than would normally be the case in this style. Had I tasted this blind, I would have been unable to discern this from any ordinary Belgian blonde; both styles are clearly intended to profit from the pale lager revolution. This one (having been made in Belgium!) does not differ at all from many dryish Belgian blonde quenchers, so until I get my hands on a real American or Canadian example of the style for comparison, this remains a non-style to me. Still, by itself, this is not too unpleasant, and reading the other ratings here, I assume having a bottle of some age (past its best before date by a few months) has deprived it from a lot of its hop aroma - which I guess shouldnt even have been there in the first place, if the intention was to make a true cream ale...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Je dois tout de même admettre quelle offre en bouche une effervescence inattendue, ce qui représente pour moi sa plus grande qualité.

As for the beer. Pours a cloudy amber-gold, and I suspect I should have used a nicer glass than a tumbler to get the proper effect. The white head isnt significant and reduces to a spotty sheet quickly. Nose has decent malts, some citrus hops, and it seem a little sour grapefruit. Is this a soured beer? Lets find out. Nope, not soured, but there is a chucky amount of bittering hops in this fella, some citrus hops, and a softer hay malts that really dont stand up. Quite bitter on the aftertaste. Not finding this beer well balanced. The bitterness is dominating its poor malt sub, and everyone has forgotten the safety word. Not a bad beer, but not exceptional.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Helsdon"

The nose has soft citrusy, floral hop notes paired with pale malts, grain and a touch of caramel. The flavour is slightly dry with pale, grainy malts up front matched with delicate hops that build through the middle towards a citrusy, slightly piney mildly bitter finish that lingers. There is also a touch of pale malt in the finish as well. On the palate, it is light in body with a dryish, slightly astringent texture and soft carbonation.

Eventually youd get bored and steal another tank heading through the city destroying all in your wake. Im not sure what the point of doing that was but I guess I had more time to waste then than I do now, though writing all this is a clear show that I have more time on my hands than I should.

398,"2012-04-21",3.7,"Creamy straw-like pour with a nice frothy white lid. Bags of aromas of citrus, mainly orange but a hint of lemon.  Hops, pine, caramel and floral notes. Cream Ale is very slightly dry and hoppy bitter on initial sip. The sweetness from the orange and caramel is subdued. Hoppy bitterness is the predominant flavour. Very refreshing with good carbonation. 

I could drink a skinful of Cream Ale.

Mild floral hops introduce the beer, followed by a hint of sweet apricot. A brief body of smooth caramel gives way to a mild hint of pine, and then an oddly metallic finish, which jars with an otherwise pleasant beer. Aside from the odd finish, this is a decent brew.

--prima cream ale personale, e sinceramente non ho idea di cosa dovrei aspettarmi. Per quello che ho letto dovrebbe essere una sorta di stile ibrido fra una pale ale americana e una pale lager. Effettivamnete si ha una sensazione generica che ricorda un classico prodotto americano, con luppoli in prima linea nelle loro sfumature più fruttate/agrumate; daltra parte  in bocca lascia una sensazione leggera e secca tipica di una pale lager ordinaria ( qualche aggiunta di mais ?? -etichetta in danese- ). Dubbiosa la sensazione metallica abbastanza evidente che ricorda la birra in lattina.

398,"2011-04-28",3.1,"Tap at Paradiso Dupont. The pour is quite pretty: a glowing, light, hazed yellow with a small, denser, off-white head. Not much retention or lace but Paradiso is notorious for shitty looking pours. Baby lace emerges from fizzy retention. Aroma is sugary lemon, citrus hoppy, lemon/lime Gatorade powder, light orange candies. As it warms, a quick peek in the nose blasts you with raspberry schnapps. Taste is fizzy up front, then moves to English biscuit malty with mild diacetyl and soapy hops. Very soapy back end moving to massive bitterness verging on astringent chemical and heavy nut skins. Large carbonation presence detracts from mouthfeel. Large resinous hops creates a 100 IBU explosion that is just so far off from Cream Ale it is hilarious. Would put most American Pale Ales to shame. Definitely way off for style, a gimmick, and should be moved to the APA category. 6A. Cream Ale BJCP Style Guidelines
Aroma: Faint malt notes. A sweet, corn-like aroma and low
levels of DMS are commonly found. Hop aroma low to none.
Any variety of hops may be used, but neither hops nor malt
dominate. Faint esters may be present in some examples, but
are not required. No diacetyl.
Flavor: Low to medium-low hop bitterness. Low to moderate
maltiness and sweetness, varying with gravity and attenuation.
Usually well attenuated. Neither malt nor hops prevail in
the taste. A low to moderate corny flavor from corn adjuncts is
commonly found, as is some DMS. Finish can vary from
somewhat dry to faintly sweet from the corn, malt, and sugar.
Faint fruity esters are optional. No diacetyl.Classic American (i.e., pre-prohibition) Cream Ales were slightly stronger, hoppier (including some dry hopping) and more bitter (25-30+ IBUs). Bitterness
rarely rises above 20 IBUs.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Hops in the nose and thats about it. But it smells pretty good. A bit much for cream ale though.
Hops with a bit of a muted watered down IPA taste. Barely any maltiness, but it is a cream ale - it just doesnt taste like a cream ale either.
Thin watery fizzy feeling left behind with a bitterness and hop flavor. Not very cream ale-ish.
Its alright if you want a watered down IPA type of beer. But if you are wanting a cream ale - like this claims to be - youd be better off with a Genny. I like Mikkeller beers, but this one falls short of his normal offerings.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

398,"2010-02-07",3.1,"330ml bottle (4:20, Rome)
Fairly fruity hoppy aroma. Pleasant carbonation, crisp hoppy palate. I feel like Ive had mikkeller beers like this a dozen times before under different names. There is some creaminess to the palate once or twice. Perhaps heading towards boring hoppy lopsidedness, but the balance it pretty good. Any hoppier, and Id have started marking this down, it was already beyond Annas threshold, I think.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
