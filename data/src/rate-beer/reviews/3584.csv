3584,"2017-06-17",3.7,"6/14/17. 12oz can from Rome Liquor & Tobacco. Lightly hazed golden orange with a wonderful off-white head. Cucumber aroma is strong, touches of lime, lactic. Cucumber strong in the flavor, salinity is balanced, lime and spice is subtle. The cucumber is a touch too much for my tastes, but still a great beer.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3584,"2016-12-30",4.1,"Draft at the brewery with Linh, Scarlett and Mom. Pours a deep, murky peach colored body with thin white lacing. Nose is pure, fresh cucumber water with a hint of lime. Mouthfeel is unbelievably refreshing with the cucumber and lime flavors executed and paired perfectly. Unreal and totally unique - by far the best cucumber beer Ive had to date.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3584,"2016-05-22",3.1,"Pours hazy yellow with only a thin ring of head. Aroma is pickled cucumber. Flavor is sour and biscuity with some barnhouse funk.

3584,"2015-06-20",3.1,"Growler. Cloudy golden pour. Big head that quickly falls to nothing. No lacing. Huge cucumber aroma. Slight lime note. Taste is big cucumber, slight lime, slight spice. Note bad, strange but not bad.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"
3584,"2015-06-20",4.0,"Not a style I drink a ton of, but really good. Cucumber on the nose, not too much coriander (good for me). Not mouth puckeringly sour or overly salty. Delicious.

3584,"2015-05-30",4.5,"Growler. Cucumber blast on the nose. The appearance is nice and cloudy. Cucumber, lime, almost watermelon like flavors. This one really knocks your socks off with flavor and drink ability. Slight saltiness adds to the mouth feel. Banging beverage.","","craigcochran"

3584,"2014-11-08",4.0,"Growler with hella thanks to jbruner! Pours cloudy golden orange with a large off-white head, creamy with nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is watermelon, cucumber, lemon, coriander. Flavor is light sweet and light tart. Lots of watermelon/cucumber stuff going on, wheat, lemon, a touch of saltiness. Medium body, high carbonation, creamy mouthfeel with some finishing salt. Nice effort, and shockingly the cucumber (which I normally hate) did not ruin this at all.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3584,"2014-10-16",3.9,"On tap at the brickstore. Nice take on the style with a crisp clean flavor and lots of cucumber notes. Little salty, pleasantly so. Crisp fruity aroma. Nice especially as the summer comes to a close.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
3584,"2014-10-10",4.1,"Draft @ BSP. Honestly this kind of blew my mind a bit. Had this while waiting to start a bottle share and couldnt of been more perfect light refreshing palate waker upper. Lightly tart, bit salty, wheat, cucumber comes in gently (not like some cucumbers beers Ive had). Perfectly dry and refreshing. Crushable.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
3584,"2014-09-01",3.9,"Draft at Southerly Love Brewfest 2014. Hazy yellow color, medium white head. Aroma of earthy light summer fruit. Taste is dry, earthy. Tasty.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3584,"2014-06-19",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2014 Pours a hazy yellow on tap with thin bubbly white head. Aroma of the sour Athena up front then you get vague hints of the vegetal spice. Taste is more towards the salt with the sour lactic wheat behind it. Dry yet refreshing, light and easy, enjoyable. They have updated this beer to be a cucumber lime gose, and it is amazingly refreshing and drinkable now.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
