1309,"2015-02-22",4.7,"Had this one with friends a couple nights ago. Been aging in my beer fridge. 

This had the most barrel influence Ive ever been able to discern in a beer. I am a Scotch fan (esp the peated variety) so to me it was very welcome. For a beer, it has an intense peat and Scotch nose.

Alcohol not overpowering given the ABV, I suspect the aging has helped there. I also did not pick up strong hops influence so for me another win for aging.

A great beer, especially if you like peated Scotches.",", Missouri, USA","Flyin_Fer"

1309,"2013-06-29",4.2,"750 ml bottle, 2012 vintage. Served in a thistle glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head.

Theres also some bready malt/grain, oak, pears, candied fruit, iodine, honey and toffee noticeable too. I think the peaty and sweet flavors mesh well together in this brew, it tastes better and better the longer I drink it.

Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a peaty mouthfeel. Really unusual. The base beer must be fairly weak, as it vanishes when compared to the barrel.

1309,"2013-02-09",4.0,"Bottle and served in my La Chouffe tulip: Pours a hazy coppery golden hue with a fading head and spotty lace.  The aroma has a rich caramelized malt overtone along with moderate peat and charred vapours. Very earthy, woody and displays a unique ripened fruit ester as well. The taste is all about the confluence of malt and peat, shockingly well balanced with just a touch of hop bitterness. Lovely olde school malting really works with the Scotch barrel IMO. Again there is a random fruitiness that adds a nice level of complexity to this brew.  My only worries about this is a potential for some wild yeasties to suddenly turn this beer bad. It is quite warming much like a good scotch and does display some of that medicinal aftertaste found with peaty liquids. Overall I am actually surprised by this, I honestly did not expect it to be so good.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1309,"2012-11-16",3.6,"Rating this one much more on how well I think they did it more than my actual enjoyment. Im not a big fan of Scotch and it taste as much or more like that than beer to me.  It pours copper/orange with a medium sized off-white head.  The aroma has lots of scotch, caramel, toffee, vanilla, rustic grainy oak and alcohol - very warm on the alcohol.  Fairly rich and very heavy on the whiskey aspects.  It has a medium body thats a bit grainy and rough with semi-sharp carbonation.  The flavor starts with dry caramel, rough oak, warming alcohol, earthy scotch whiskey and some fruitiness.  The finish is even more warm and rough with lots of woodiness and whiskey.  Its good for what they were shooting for.  But the alcohol tastes like it is more than the 10.2% listed and the whiskey is too up front for my tastes.
