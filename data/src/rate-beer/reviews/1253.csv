1253,"2014-10-03",4.3,"Impeccably cloudy, the color of prune juice. Layer of slush on top. Looks like a chunky barleywine. Glows only slightly in front of the light.

Aroma is supremely sugary malts: definitely closer to a barleywine aroma than a doppelbock even. The piney hops are definitely there, floating above the malts as an accent. Finished wood and resins. Light oak.

Flavor is sugary malts, more resinous hops. Spicy finished wood. Basically everything in the aroma matches in the flavor. Has a taste of powdered Lipton iced tea.

Feels rough and grainy; not quite a choker but a slow sipper. This is a very good beer. Although the prices Ive seen them charging for a six pack is outrageous, its a damned fine beer.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

1253,"2014-08-10",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 10-26-12-
 Served on tap in a 10 oz snifter

 Appearance  Served an amber colored brew with a half finger white head. The head faded over a moderate time to leave a decent level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma was heaviest of malt and some toffee and caramel sweetness. Mixed with these aromas were some good hoppy aromas of a grapefruit citrus as well as a pine aroma.

 Taste  The taste begins with a sweet toffee and malty flavor with a good presence of a grapefruit hop flavor. As the taste moves more toward the middle there are flavors of a pine hop that come to the tongue. While this occurs some of the sweetness fades a bit. In the end the pine and grapefruit grow slightly stronger and in the end leave a hop bittered, but malt balanced flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is smooth and creamy with a carbonation level that is just about average. The smooth and creamier body is great for the hop flavors and really lets them shine through the flavor profile.

 Overall  Quite nice. The beer has a great flavor profile, nice flavor transitions as well a good feel for the style . While not what I would consider a doppelbock, it is a god blend of doppel and IPA. Its very drinkable, flavorful, and very tasty.","","Darkmagus82"

The head is thin and short-lived.  The nose is initially slight, before revealing some bready German character malt, along with an herbal and slightly harsh hop aroma.  The palate seems to showcase the American ingredients more than those from Germany.  Moderate bitterness up front, in the middle, and lingering in the finish; overshadowing any doppelbock-like malt note.  The mouthfeel lacks the almost-coating consistency of traditional doppelbocks.  Something approaching the flavor profile of an American Strong ale or American Barley Wine seems like it would have been more appropriate here.

1253,"2009-08-08",3.3,"Stoudts Brewing out of Adamstown, PA has many year-long beers, and quite a few seasonal to flesh them out. One in particular is the Smooth Hoperator. As her name implies, she aims to take one down the smooth side of doppelbock-hood, emphasizing a more congenial relationship between hops and malts.


She poured a deep amber, polished and clear as day, a sure sign that I am dealing with a heartily doppelbock. A small collar tries to keep her reigned in, but fails most miserably. I cant complain though when the nose that rushes out to great me is ripe with crushed pine needles, sticky and sappy, caramelized sugars melting in the summer sun, sliced grapefruit and lemon, and crunchy sugar granules sprinkled on top for a final crunchy, sweet finish. Pinching my nose, I take a deep breath and dive in, all inhibitions tossed to the winds. Sweet, hoppy, sappy, grassy, and malty all at the same time. The sweetness of her malty side greets me first with cool cooked sugars, brown sugar, and whole wheat sweet rolls. The bittering hops come in second, hitting the top of my tongue with grapefruit and lemon rinds, their dry bitterness lingering after each quaff. Cinnamon sticks and nutmeg pepper my breath, warming her palate just enough for the next onslaught to begin. Not an overly complex doppelbock, but playfully balanced between malty and hoppy, a conflict of interests which works very well for the Smooth Hoperator.


A very sessionable doppelbock, I would definitely enjoy going back for another round with this hoppy malt-bomb. Not as robust as many doppelbocks, but well-balanced and still replete with flavor.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Aroma was predominantly hoppy both pine and some grapefruit, underneath that was an obvious caramel malt with some grainyness as well.

Smooth on the palate with a medium body and light carbonation, and a bit of lingering stickiness. Malt flavors are on board first, but the bitter hop hit starts quickly, building to a mildly bitter finish with a slight metallic quality.

I could not get much out of the aroma with this one.  I could only pick up hops and malt.  Perhaps this is due to the glass that I used.  The taste is predominately hop oriented.

The flavor is just as unique, the hops are wonderfully fresh and bright with some citrus and floral notes while the malt is sweet and toffee like with light hints of coffee.  An incredibly well balanced and fun take on an often boring style.  Not that everyone will take to this, it does take a certain open-mindedness with regards to style authenticity.  Nice mouthfeel, medium bodied with a bit of a resiny sticky finish and moderate fizzy carbonation.  Pretty neat beer.

Flavor works off the hop tones, in a more bitter, yet still flavor forward manner. As the bold, glowing hop oil show fades, a residue of deeper, chewier malt caramels is left behind for nice balanced, twinged with a house yeast and a bit of alcohol complexity. This is a very nice beer! I like the temporal play of hops and malt, the balanced, and the finish. This is a well thought-out and executed beer.

1253,"2008-08-17",3.4,"Objectively speaking:
A complicated recipe that ultimately ended up in an uncomplicated IPA.

I like:
The clean lager character is there alright perhaps allowing more fruitiness to come out from the hops. Pleasant hop profile taking on the grapefruity citrus realm, but also heading towards peppery, pineapple and plain green territory. Good control on the residuals sugars.

I dislike:
Really limited toasted malt presence does not leave much bock character behind the hop fix.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1253,"2008-08-13",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Grapefruity, coniferous hops dally within lean caramel sweetness right before a pleasant toasty finish is pricked by leafy bitterness. This is a jovial strong lager which lets itself be drunk throughout.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the clear ruby-copper.
-Obviously, this is not brewed to a specific style, and it should be approached with an open, thirsty mind.
-The fruity hoppiness is quite citrusy, even though that fruitiness is quickly taken over by wooden, resinous notes.
-The flavor profile is balanced in its semi-intensity.
-Although all is clean and flavorful, I guess I did not find the recipe compelling enough.

The smell is big on hops up front with a big caramel malt aroma right on top of it.  There are also some significant candy sugar whiffs as well.  Taste is toasted malts with caramel but with a huge grapefruit hop kick up front.  The finish is fairly clean given the two competing tastes.  Mouthfeel is medium with some decent carbonation but fairly clean and crisp.

Overall, this is a very interesting beer and certainly the most hopped up doppelbock I have ever tasted.  The big flavors may not meld as well as I would like, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
1253,"2008-06-09",3.6,"12 oz bottle. Clear amber with a yellowy beige head. Good carbonation. Sweet, caramel nose balanced nicely by grapefruit and earth. This has to be the hoppiest doppelbock ever. Pleasant, mildly sweet malty flavor to start, then a pretty serious grapefruit hop smack. Some earthiness backs the grapefruit, particularly after it warms a bit. Lingering finish that does not seem to know what it wants to be - sometimes kinda sweet caramel, sometimes earthy bitter. Im not really sure what to make of this beer, but it is damn tasty, for sure.","Virginia Beach, USA","Immy"

Some toasty malt behind it, but mostly fresh hops.  Taste is slightly toasty,  unique maltiness with again nice big hop influence.

Retention is minimal and within a few minutes there is barely a trace of foam on the surface.
Aromatics are pungently filled with tropical fruits and sweet malt. Mango, tangerine, peach, candied grapefruit, and plump, juicy malt.

Sticky hop resins lead off the pallet, with juicy, ripe citrus fruits and sugar-dusted spruce needles. Plenty of peachs, pears, and tangerine. 
Plump, fresh, sticky malt follows through with some warming alcohol and a firm bitterness. A trace of toasted malt is lost in the hop attack.
Finishes with sweet malt, lingering tropical fruit and warming on the throat.

1253,"2008-01-17",3.1,"Draught tulip at Sunset Grill on 11/17/07Funny to see this is a heller doppelbock.  I drank this thinking it was a strong IPA.  Of course, it dosent quite come off as a strong IPA, but, it sure dosent come off as a doppelbock, heller or otherwise.  Dark bronze with a medium off-white head that laces lightly.  Clear with moderate carbonation.Quite assertively bitter in the nose, though with some pleasant fruitiness (strawberries, cherries, nectarines) and somewhat unpleasant fruitiness (green apples).  Dry malt courses through the nose, showing off graham crackers, whitebread and upon warming, dollops of medium-sweet caramel.  Bitterness eventually overcomes any sweetness and leaves dry, rather limp/weak malts in its wake.  No flaws or alcohol noted.  Medium strength of aroma.Hard, dry malts up front show light melanoidins and quickly pass in to a bitter, leafy, peppery hop mess.  Bitterness and sharp citrus flavors never soften and bits of caramel and toffee seem to clash with the hop notes.  I like how FlacoAlto comments on the garlic-like flavor of the summit hops, and I really see that here.  Way too much acidity without soft enough malt sugars.  Carbonation is moderate, texture is hard.  No alcohol or flaws noted.Not rating this to any particular style.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1253,"2008-01-10",3.1,"Pours with a frothy, somewhat dense, initially fat-two-finger thick, creamy tan colored head.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, gold-hued, bright cranberry color.  The aroma is nicely hoppy, with notes of herbal pine noticed up front.  A closer inspection yields more of the same, but with more intensity.  This is citrus infused though with aromas reminiscent of grapefruit, touches of tangerine and some notes of lemon rind.  This has a ""herbal"" note to it that makes me think of hemp seed oil, this note, while somewhat soft, is definitely, distinctly noticeable.  There is also a fair amount of malt character here by way of toasty malt notes, soda crackers and a touch of caramel malts.

The hop character is aggressively noticeable from the get go.  A bracing bitterness and tons of herbal, rank hop flavors linger on in the finish.  A mix of garlic chives, hemp oil, astringent hop leaf and pungent pine sap lingers on in the finish and really clings to the palate.  What malt character is noticeable is quite clean and provides a touch of chewy, malty, complex sweetness for all of a half second at the front of each sip before it is subsumed by the dominant hop notes.  Touches of softer, fruit-focused hop notes can be noticed at times; flavors of grapefruit and tangerine can be pulled out if you really dig for it.

I was quite surprised to see this listed as a Doppelbock.  The hop character is clearly the dominant note here; even to be an American interpretation the malt really needs to play a bigger role here (this is of course my own opinion though as this beer clearly shines as an example that I am wrong).  This really does not work for me even on a purely hop driven level as the garlic / herbal hop character of Summit hops is just a bit too dominant to be enjoyable.  This is just another beer that proves to me how much I really do not like Summit hops.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The strong and modestly sweet aroma is packed with lots of orangy Armarillo hops.  The underlying rich, malty base is also present in the aroma.  The flavor has a sweet, toasted maltiness (the Vienna malt is subtle but definitely comes through in the finish) with a well-balanced orange citrus and resin/pine hoppiness.  The bitterness level is perfect.  This beer has a medium-full body and feels thick (a nicde quality for this beer).  This is definitely one of the more impressive Stoudts brews that Ive had!

Red licorice and bananas on the tongue with a very forward dry-hopped bitterness.  Citrus skins and even some resinous pine sap suggestions.  Rubber, generally chemical dryness and maple wood.  The subtleties of the German influence are, for the most part, buried.  More reminiscent of a California IPA with a unique affectation of malt sugars.  Medium bodied palate highlights the interplay between bitter and sweet quite successfully.  Definitely interesting, though maybe a bit contrived.  Thanks Jason!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Much higher-hopped than a normal Doppelbock, a nice sign of character here, not overdone; still, theres no question, this is an IPA rather than a DB.  Taste is full of hop-zing, sharp and bitter with a nice breadiness morphing into orange with a touch of yeast.  Enough malt balance, though the net effect still leans one way.  Medium-light body great for quaffing, dry grapefruit and lemon-orange blend for an aftertaste.  Interesting enough, but did anyone else pronounce this as Hope-erator?

The taste - a decent alcohol presence that ramps up slowly, sweet roast cereal grain - maybe a hint of cherry? - and solid dry hop bitterness, like dessicated spruce or resin - anyway, balanced, smooth; a gentle ride.  Slick, soft mouthfeel, more astringent than it seem, you notice it more in the aftertaste, which is not too bitter ...

Nice creamy head that tempts me to feel it with my fingers. Creamy looking! Good hop impact on the initial taste. Not as offensive as many other highly hopped brews Ive tasted. It smooths out in the development of the palate. Oh, so this is a doppelbock? No way! Barely any carbonation. Not overwhelming but still does impart a medicinal quality on the back of the throat. Too hoppy for a doppelbock. Not nearly as good as Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock or Tröegs Troegenator Doublebock.

Smell is of hop blasts with consisting notes of floral, herbal, tea leaves, pine sap, grapefruit, dry grapenuts, and caramel malt.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a doughy, fruity yeastiness really taking control of the flavor and making it more English Ale like with notes of herbal tea and sugar.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter from the yeast and hop selection that carries mostly notes of herbs that collapse on the middle of the tongue in a dry fashion after starting off with a caramel sweetness.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
1253,"2007-05-05",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2008 I am editing this to say that I did not notice this is a doppelbock.  I popped the bottle, drank and assumed it was a pale ale.  I certainly didnt think it was a doppelbock.  Anyway, onto the original review:
Awesome pale ale, like adrain said Im not sure whether this is an APA or an IPA, sure tasted like an IPA though, deep dark amber color with a soft & pillow-like off-white head, excellent lacing around the glass, very hoppy nose with notes of grapefruit & freshly cut grass, bitter flavors with more notes of grapefruit with hints of caramel malt & a touch of alcohol, bitter & dry finish, another fantastic pale ale from Stoudts","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
1253,"2007-05-04",3.2,"12 oz bottle.  Not sure whether to call this an ipa or an apa.  Pours a clear  dark reddish amber color with a medium white fizzy head.  Aroma of piney citrus hops.  Taste is slightly metallic with faint citrus hops and a weak old piney, basement mold finish.  Not very impressed.","Doylestown, PA, USA","adrian910ss"
