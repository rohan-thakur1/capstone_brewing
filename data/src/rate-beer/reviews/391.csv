391,"2017-06-20",3.3,"Bottle, mine at 5.0% abv. Nose lightly fruity, traditional cream ale, stronger vanilla, stale coffee -- quite and acceptable mix. Pour clear golden, buffed and a little dingy, head is bright white soap. Light-watery body but peppy and zippy with crisp carbonation, bready finish and nutty-bready aftertaste, has that essence of coffee bean without going heavy scorch. Clean, light earth (here presumably from the vanilla bean, not malt), low bitterness that accumulates, moderately dry, but bright and fresh. A balanced bridge to proper food - well done.

391,"2017-05-18",3.1,"Shared bottle. Poured hazy pale golden. Nose was pale malt, vanilla, coffee, mild hops. Medium to lighter body, some hops, pale malt, vanilla, coffee.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
391,"2017-04-15",3.4,"Appearance: bright brass. Slightly hazy. Fine head of white bubbles
Nose: Just a hint of coffee over biscuit malt
Taste: A lot like a lighter roasted coffee. A bit of coffee flavor over a slightly sweet ale. Hops if any are very reserved.
Body: Medium to lighter with soft carbonation
Parting thoughts: I am enjoying the flavor infusions that Wolfs Ridge is doing. They mesh very well with the base beer. this one is no different. Its a cream ale, but the flavor profile is reminiscent of the blonde stouts.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
391,"2017-04-14",3.9,"On tap at Wolfs Ridge. OK, so Im a sucker for this variety of beer. Its unexplainable, but I love it. The pale with the coffee thing... yee-ha! Anyhow, this was a good take on the style. It has a nice clean gold body with aromas of mild coffee and a bit of creaminess. Flavor is crisp and coffee-based. Wonderful!","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
391,"2016-11-26",3.8,"Draft to taster in a flight at Wolfs Ridge. Pours a clear golden color with a small off white head. The aroma has a nice creamy coffee character, vanilla cream. The flavor has more of the same, mild coffee, vanilla cream, a subtle coffee bitterness to the finish, nice treatment for the base beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
391,"2016-11-26",3.9,"Draft to taster at source pour clear light gold with minimal white head. Nose big roasted coffee, some cream ale malt. Taste nice mix of coffee, sweet malt, vanilla ice cream, then back to coffee. I like it.","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"
391,"2016-09-26",3.5,"Bottle to snifter (shared with the Mrs; thanks DrSilverworm). Looks good; a fairly transparent golden orange with eggshell head that steadily dissipates into thin lacing. Smells semi-sweet with notes of coffee and vanilla. Tastes like it smells, but a little less sweet, and with some softly bitter coffee roast. Mouthfeel is medium-light to medium-bodied. Enjoyable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
391,"2016-09-20",4.0,"Sampler at brewpub. Pours golden with a white head. Nice brewed coffee notes on the nose. Lovely balance between the coffee and the cream ale elements. Finished clean. Nice example of style.

391,"2016-08-23",3.7,"12 oz. bottle as a trade bonus. Pours a clear gold without much depth of color, not unusual for the style, with a very small white fizzy head that immediately dissipates into a thin ring. The beans dominate the nose, whereas they make up primarily the second half and aftertaste of the flavor. The initial flavor is a more traditional cream ale, with sweet corn, cereal grains, mineral, and hay. Light-bodied, with modest carbonation and a smooth, thin, sweet mouthfeel. Fun beer. Need to try it super fresh, although this one is just a couple months old.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
391,"2016-08-14",4.1,"Bottle sample. The beer is a clear yellow with a white head of foam. Good color when you consider the coffee addition. Dont know how they managed it, but cool nonetheless. The aroma has rich coffee and subtle vanilla bean. Really enjoying how the coffee comes through in this. Great beer!","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

391,"2016-07-13",3.6,"Sampled at the brewery. Clear light golden with a white head. First sip is like a cream soda. Fruity with some grain. Gently hop bitterness. Corn works here. Green coffee beans and earth. Interesting take on a cream.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
391,"2016-05-29",4.1,"22 ounce bottle, no dating on it that I noticed but I think it was a somewhat recent release. Served in a shaker pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like coffee along with some bready/grainy malt and vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma, as I think the coffee is the strongest flavor. Theres also some vanilla, cream and grainy malt noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, its really easy to drink and is well carbonated. I cant say that Im normally a big cream ale fan, but brews like this will get me to change my mind! I think Ill have to grab another bomber of this soon, definitely recommend this one to anyone who likes coffee beers. $6.99 a bomber.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

The beer pours a clear pale golden color with a medium thin white head that dissipates steadily to a film. Short strings of lacing. Aroma of roasted coffee and malt. Light-bodied with a roasty coffee and malt character, with a touch of sweetcorn in the background. The finish is roasty with a lingering mild coffee aftertaste.
