This beer is intense, complex and balanced, For a dunkler bock, this beer is dark and roasted. Amazing intense flavour that would not be out of place in a stout.

Pours a mirky dark brown with tanned moussy head.
Aroma, well... I know its the hops, but it smell like a blooming spliff if you ask me! Theres even some ashy hint in there, it was very hard after that resin-like marihuana smell to get something of the coffee or bitter chocolate, the roasted malts even...
It has a rather thin mouthfeel, lightly oily, soft to low carbonation, and an reasonably soft bitter aftertaste.
There is a citric high edge to it all, almost metallic, but not unleasantly so.
Theres roasted malt, toasted bread, almost floral hoppyness, the joint that has apparently fallen in, has also given its ashlike taste to it, it does really taste a bitt of grass ( yeah, that type of...) . Theres also a umami, silt like note in there. As a layman, I must admit I did expect something a bit different from a bock, but if it is a stout, its not likely to become my favourite...
