Benzene is there, but way less than the Japanese sakes tasted so far. Subtle, no doubt, but maybe a tad characterless. Sweetish, and a strange, plastic-like, nearly artificial flavour. Again very restrained, maybe too characterles; Again a stonefruit impression, if very faint. Serious alcoholwarming, throatburn, despite the velvety, indeed silky MF.

Clear and colorless, with pretty good legs on the side of the glass. The aroma is green apples, juniper, caramel, and corn syrup. Mild, fruity sweetness, and a herbal bitterness. Fairly thick body, smooth, but with a vegetal feel, slightly grainy, and fairly astringent. Theres a relatively significant alcohol warming through the finish.

So if you’re into sake, I guess discount my rating, but since this is a beer website first and foremost, that’s probably a pretty safe bet for many of these sake ratings. Aroma of light fruits, maybe some melon varieties, sweet apples, sweet tangerines. Flavor very very strong in the alcohol department, not sure if the appearance just made me think vodka, or if the overpowering alcohol did that by itself, but in any case, any light, playful fruitiness I found in the nose was erased by the urge to spit out everything I put in my mouth.

Very strong and as someone else said, it reminded me of vodka.  Nothing at all like beer, more like hard alcohol or wine.  The alcohol in this was too harsh and I could not even finish my glass.

Although I read that ginjo is ""supposed"" to be sampled cool, I really preffered it warm: there were abundant sweet fruity white grape and melon scents, with a bit of a sharp, chemical-like nose, perhaps the alcohol  but it presented a slightly unpleasent paint thinner aroma.  The texture as light, altogether a little spicy and a little fruity.  Enjoyable but still not doing it for me with Sake.  Its fun to try though.  Sake is my new beer.

1613,"2005-02-02",3.7,"Clear alcohol, creates smooth sheet on glass. Nice fruity aroma. Mostly a sweet melon thing with pleasent girl shampoo and very little alcohol showing up. Light flavor... again a fruity melon comes in. Oily body. I dont know much about sake, but this is pretty good. Its very smooth and clean. Alcohol is unobtrusive.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
1613,"2005-01-24",3.5,"Since my guinomi, masu, and ochoko were all dirty I poured this into my Double Bastard glass. I hope that I have not offended this easily offended beverage! Clear as distilled water. Forms a thin coating sheet and thin viscous legs on the glass when swirled. The aroma is that of a Sake, this much is clear to me. Definte fruitiness, pear and possibly melon, clean grain alcohol is also present (hey rice is a grain!). The flavor is much lighter than the other few Sakes I have had. The fruity pear that was present in the aroma is also present in the flavor. The alcohol is shockingly well masked given that it is 15% and looks like water! Mildy sweet throughout with a fruity alcoholish aftertaste. The palate is clean without cloying and lingering sweetness. The body is medium and somewhat more like wine than beer. Improves greatly as it warms towards 60F. Most of this rating was written while it moved from 52F to 58F. Yes I am a sake rookie, and yes this is probably the first time I have ever had a sake without some sushi or sashimi but I have tried my best. I would like t try more sakes but cost will keep my adventures to a minimum I am afraid.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
1613,"2004-11-15",3.5,"This was a good sake. It was light and pleasant, warm and soothing to the mouth. Next to the purple sake I once had, this is probably my favourite yet (I had it at Surin West with sushi).","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","DerBiermeister"
1613,"2004-10-17",2.8,"Quite pleased to see a few (literally 3) ""cold"" sakes show up at Hayashi in Williamsburg.  Served in the little bamboo cups with a wedge of cucumber (the lemon of the sake world).  Ice bucket was a nice touch.  Clear.  Aroma was slightly fruity, a cucumber note even after I disposed of the slice, and had a bit of chervil in the background.  The flavor was dominated by melon.  Unfortunately, Im not a big fan of melon.  Better when very cold.  Good, slightly oily  mouthfeel, none of the alcohol burn people associate with warm sakes.  Just not to my liking because of this particular flavor profile.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1613,"2004-09-11",2.6,"Clear color, like water or vodka. Ive only had a few sakis, and I typically enjoy them, but I had a hard time getting past the flavor of this one. Made me feel all nice and fuzzy though =)","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
1613,"2004-08-14",3.9,"Being more of a Whisky drinker this is a small step for me.Nice clear color,fruity aroma with a little something else in there that is hard to describe.The flavor was smooth and mildly fruity with a nice alcohol presence.Another one of those dangerous Sakes that are so easy to drink that polishing off a bottle in one sitting would be easy,just do to its easy drinkability.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
1613,"2004-08-12",2.9,"My second sake, I kinda liked the Nigori a little better. Clear appearance, no head. Melony, alcohol, slightly fruit aroma. Taste is dry, strong alcohol. Good fruity flavors. Not too thin. Good sake.","Newburgh/Buffalo, New York, USA","spkldhenlvr24"
1613,"2004-07-28",3.3,"Aaah, the aroma here - fruits and anise - I love it.  Very smooth and easy to drink (oh boy, be careful here, its kind of strong......)  Taste is at first fruity (think summer fruits - melons, etc., but not citrus).  Maybe its the combo of fruit and alcohol, but I get a nice amount of anise in the finish also.  Even though this is very clear, if you hold it up to the light, you can see the even clearer lacing slip down the edges of the glass (I drank this out of a thin tall shot glass).  Bring on more Sake for me!!!!!!!!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
1613,"2004-05-28",3.6,"Clear color. No head. Aroma is fruity (melons and apples) with a hint of wood. Clean and crisp tasting. Alcohol flavor is evident, but not that annoying. Kind of fruity and mild, slightly sweet. Semi-dry. Very smooth. Very pleasant to just sit down and sip. Mouthfeel is very full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. with a definite alcohol bite.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1613,"2004-05-15",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2004 Crystal clear, filtered. Colorless. Slow-moving legwork. Clean alcohol in the aroma with hints of melon, jellied rice, yeast, and alcohol. Soft, oily body. Slight sweetness up front followed by luxurious alcohol. Light astringency interwoven with delicate acidity and melon. Finishes decadently soft and slightly sweet with tolerable alcohol burn as it slides down the throat. Lingers with sweet notes of rice, vanilla, and honeyed melon. Elegant, super clean, remarkably balanced Ginjo.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1613,"2004-05-14",3.3,"Very smooth, just slightly cloudy. Clean finish. Like a very very high quality unfiltered vodka mixed with distilled water. There is not much alcoholic burn at all and after reading APs rating Im curious to try ginjos that have even less.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
1613,"2004-03-06",3.7,"This is one of the first Sake  I've  had.  Which to my surprise I liked very much.  Looking forward to trying some more.  Fruity, floral, flavors.  Finishes dry and very clean.","New Jersey, USA","beerslayer"
1613,"2004-01-24",2.8,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2004 Surprisingly good stuff out of Berkeley, CA, although it came in fifth out of six sakes in tonight's tasteoff.  Delicate and dry.  Faint fruity aroma with hints of apples.  Taste is light, dry and subtle.  A true Ginjo competitive with some Japanese products.  Very decent, and only moderate alcohol burn, though there's more burn here than in Star Filled Sky JG or Hakkaisan JG.  There's a touch of sourness up front (very faint).  A credible effort.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

1613,"2003-12-15",3.0,"My first Sake. At first the aroma seems like all alcohol; eventually I think I can detect ""forest"" notes. Slightly sweet (like japanese rice vinegar), with an alcohol burn, not as thin as I supposed. A good one for a !first","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1613,"2003-11-30",3.0,"chilled: clear.  aroma of rice vinegar, sweet thai rice dessert, white wine, grapes, rubbing alcohol, and coconut oil...tangy with notes of dry chardonney, cantelope, nectarine, and pina colada..definite chewy mouthfeel that reminds me of a really good bourbon barrel aged barley wine i once had..im going to have to get used to the prevalent alcohol tones in sake...for they do tend to dominate..but other than that..not too shabby...","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1613,"2003-11-30",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2004 Served lightly chilled.Clear, light fruity aroma, hint of wood. Flavor is dominate with a rich but processed taste. Finishes with a light alcohol burn and a lasting taste. This is a pretty good sake, this one is terrible heated though, so stick to chilled on this one. What can you expect for a $5 300mL bottle?","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
