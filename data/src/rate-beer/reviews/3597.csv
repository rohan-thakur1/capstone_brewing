Spicy, citrusy and delightfully crisp, this Bitter closes on a green hop bitterness which latches on to the tastebuds just long enough for you to wonder how soon your next sip can be.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the clear amber.
-The carbonation is fluffy.
-Malts also develop toasty angles.
-The citrusy, spicy hop character is tight and nuanced.

This is indeed a lovely hoppy bitter, good malty, deeper body carrying loads of fruity flavours, there are lychees and grapefruit for me. This is a happy and engaging beer and I liked it.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
3597,"2008-10-10",3.9,"Cask at the Woolpack Beer Festival 08, Banbury, Oxon, in the company of Glen, Trev and a good sprinkling of local CAMRA members   Poured copper as the description suggested. This beer had the most lovely floral and perfumed nose, wonderfully hoppy (US hops maybe?) and some nice honey touches. Taste really was a follow on, i.e. all that was on the aroma showed itself quite beautifully in the mouth, lovely sweet honey, punchy but softened hops held in check by the malty body to this beer.  I really liked this even if it was just a tad sweet at times. If I have a criticism it could have done with the hops and bitteness presenting themselves a bit more and just pushing the honey sweetness back a little but thats just my personal preference, it was a well made and very good beer. Riight up there with the Leeds ’Gathering Storm’ for me as the two beers of the night, but just pipped at the post by the Leeds beer.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
