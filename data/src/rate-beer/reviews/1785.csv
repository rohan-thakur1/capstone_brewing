1785,"2015-07-22",3.1,"not seeing the 98 for style here. Its ok, especially next to some of the misses from GC, but definitely nothing special. A well balanced crisp ale, hoppier than usual for the style.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

1785,"2014-08-04",3.8,"Pretty good lacing for a lager, nice little white head bubbles off. Dark copper color. Nice aroma, this is lagered? Lots of complexity for the style. Taste is very good, a little bit of sourness at the end but overall well balanced and perfect for the style. Plenty of that malty goodness in it. Good body--not thin, not thick. Medium.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Caytinator"

1785,"2013-07-28",4.0,"A nice orange color. Not much aroma at all. This is sessionable, which is surprising considering the relatively high alcohol, at 7.2%. A tad bit of hops with some sweet malt, but smooth.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"

1785,"2012-10-06",3.2,"Sampled at the Tucson Beer Fest.  Clear darker gold.  This offers some rich malt and some that are pale.  Very light hops that might be noble.  Somr fruit is pretty nice.  Earth.  Just ok.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1785,"2011-07-26",3.7,"(on draught at Cruisers).  Pours clear dark amber with a thin white head.  Nice carbonation.  Aroma is sweet malt, rock candy and perfumey florals.  Taste is sweet with more perfume and light bitterness.  Full bodied with an oily texture.  Smooth finish.  The beer was a bit perfumey for me in aroma and taste, but its still an easy-to-drink beer and perfect for the setting.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"
1785,"2010-03-05",3.1,"Not my favorite style but good sampled at Cruisers 66 which the waitress told me was an extension of the brew pub next door that was closed due to a roof colapse after a heavy snow. This had a nice malty backbone with a nice hop balance. none of the musky smell you sometimes get.","Sicklerville, New Jersey, USA","keepersj12"
