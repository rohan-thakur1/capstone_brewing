80,"2017-04-26",3.8,"Bomber from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. A very dark brown pour that has a lot of tan foam. It falls slowly. Pumpkin is prominent in the aroma with some dark chocolate under. This is a nice mix of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, oatmeal, stout, and pumpkin. Some spices are in there, too but are almost buried. Lactic and earth notes. This is really a pretty good beer. Things kind of take turns moving to the front of the flavors.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
80,"2017-04-26",3.8,"Shared with Strykzone on Facebook Chat. Pours dark brown. Light tan head. Nose of pumpkin and roasted malts. Medium plus body. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is big chocolate with pumpkin following. Finishes with some spice. Excellent.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
80,"2016-11-21",4.3,"22 oz bottle served in a Max Lager glass. Pours nears black with a very durable tan head. Exceptional lacing. 

Delicious, bready aroma with a very fine mix of spices. The flavor follows but is not quite as enticing. Lightly sweet but leaves a mildly bitter aftertaste. The flavor contains notes of oatmeal, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, baked pumpkin, faint ginger and brown bread. 

Feel: full and creamy smooth body with excellent, soft medium+ carbonation. 

Overall: a pleasant surprise, this is one of the very best pumpkin beers Ive had.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
80,"2016-11-17",3.4,"Bottle. This is a great pumpkin stout. The brewers did not fall into the ""let?s use the entire spice cabinet"" trap. The body is a little thiner than some might expect of an oatmeal stout but that is","Maputo, MOZAMBIQUE","Imaena"
80,"2016-09-05",4.0,"Bottle from Whole Foods Market in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is nutmeg, cinnamon, molasses, ginger cookies. Palate and taste are composed (compared to the aroma and the expectation that this could have gone sickly sweet). A good balance of pumpkin spices flavors, wet and dry at the same time. Could have used a little more creamy oatmeal but otherwise this was wonderful.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"
80,"2016-09-02",4.1,"22 ounce bottle, label says 7.9% ABV. Not sure of the age, but I think its a 2016 bottle since it just showed up at my local store over the past few weeks. Served in a Spiegelau stout glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a couple inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like pumpkin spices (nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon), roasted malt, and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some graham cracker and clove flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and coating with a good amount of carbonation. I think its a pretty good pumpkin stout, I know Id like to buy this again in the future. $8.99 a bomber.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
80,"2016-08-13",3.8,"Bomber. Pumpkin spice aroma of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice with notes of pumpkin and chocolate malt. Pours black with two fingers of light brown head that has excellent retention and lacing. Starts with chocolate malt and pumpkin flavors as well as a little bit of roasted malt. Finishes smooth with all of the aforementioned pumpkin spices coming through and lingering on the palate through the end of the sip. Nice pumpkin stout.","","zoucrew102"
80,"2016-07-21",3.9,"Bottle pour from Friar Tuck. Appearance is opaque black with small dark brown at edges of glass, 2 finger-width light brown head with decent retention, fair lacing. Aroma is pumpkin spices along with chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is roasted malt with dark fruit, pumpkin spices, chocolate. Palate is medium bodied with creamy texture, soft-to-average carbonation, finish like the taste. Overall, a really nice pumpkin beer and a pretty good oatmeal stout.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
80,"2016-05-06",3.2,"Pumpkin nutmeg cinnamon come from this black brew with a nice light brown head. Taste the choc and pumpkin with pumpkin spices up front. The aftertaste the oatmeal comes out with a bit of warming from the alcohol. It's surprisingly light bodied for what I expected. Did well on this brew.","Marysville, California, USA","Koskela"
80,"2016-04-06",3.8,"22 oz bomber from Country Club Liquors. Nose is light cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and chocolate. Black with a big heavy lacing tan head. Flavor is lightly sweet, pumpkin spicy, and a malty chocolate backbone.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
80,"2016-03-29",3.5,"22oz bomber. Deep brown black body, respectable beige head. Pretty Stout-forward, the pumpkin and spices are rather mellow and balance out well. Nothing particularly enthralling about it, but nothing off or subpar either. Solid enough offering, a little tame with the pumpkin.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
80,"2016-01-03",3.8,"Deep black pour with a generous rocky light beige head. Earthy dry pumpkin and black roasty malt fill the nose with a little clove and roast. Nice smooth dark flavor that has a sort of bright roasty pop at the beginning full of earthy pumpkin tones, a fair dose of pumpkin pie spice, a fluffy smooth oatmeal backbone, bittersweet roasty dark cocoa towards the finish. Deep, not too pumpkiny, fair bit of fluffy oatmeal and quite earthy and roasty.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
80,"2015-11-26",4.0,"Bottle, shared with my folks before Thanksgiving dinner, pours a deep brown color with a persistent tan head. One of the best pumpkin pie smells I can recall... Light spices, pumpkin, and faint cocoa. Taste is lightly sweet with a moderate amount of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soothing with the light roast and cocoa. Really quite nice.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
80,"2015-11-18",4.0,"Pours black in the glass. Cardamom and pumpkin pie spice nose right off the bat. Slightly burnt pie crust flavor with a hint of spice. Overall, really nice..","San Antonio, Texas, USA","llcooldave"
80,"2015-11-14",3.7,"Bottle pour opaque black with large tan head. Nose sweet malt pumpkin pie spice, hint of dark fruit, and light cream. Taste light bitter early, then milk chocolate, pie filling, light spice. Creamy mouth feel. More sweet than spicy but the spice is certainly there. Loveage","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"
80,"2015-11-10",4.4,"Pours a dark brown with a creamy tan head. Smells like roasted Mexican hot chocolate with a little pine. Complex and interesting but hard to pin down. Actually not much pumpkin but some pumpkin spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Roasted chocolate, vanilla, and a little bit of a coke flavor. Hops come through as a spruce backdrop. Unusual mix of flavor but they work well together. Fairly heavy and thick. Great funky beer even if its not very pumpkin flavored.","","hockey9930"
80,"2015-11-07",3.3,"Bomber - pours a typical stout black with a minimal light brown head. Decent aroma of roasted marshmallow, dark chocolate, vanilla coke and allspice. Tasty layered flavors of roasty malts, cacao, cola, cinnamon, a hint of pumpkin pie and some bitterness on the end.","Bayfield, Colorado, USA","CObiased"
80,"2015-11-05",4.2,"Pours a dark brown with a medium, lingering beige head. The aroma is appealing and consists of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, and pumpkin. The taste has just a touch of sweetness, while hitting you with heavy cinnamon. After this subsides, you find earthy malts, nutmeg, pumpkin, bread, and gingerbread. Delicious. Aftertaste is cinnamon and pumpkin. Medium in body, with a creamy texture, while being somewhat of softer in carbonation. Drinking this is like drinking pumpkin pie. Id say this is a special offering. Must try.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
80,"2015-11-05",4.9,"The ONLY thing keeping this beer from being a perfect 5.0 is the alcohol content. They should have pushed it to 10%, if possible.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
80,"2015-11-02",3.8,"Rich and smooth with a wonderful balance of traditional oatmeal stout pumpkin pie flavors. Will definitely seek this one out again in the future.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
80,"2015-11-02",3.4,"Bottle. It poured a black color with a tan head. The aroma was of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin. The taste was similar to the aroma with roasted malts, more spices and huge pumpkin. Good stuff.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
80,"2015-11-01",4.1,"22Fl OZ ($8.99) this was a huge surprise and a good one. This was like a smokey oatmeal pumpkin pie. Not for everyone but if you enjoy flavorful stouts this was very very good.","California, USA","AAEA"
80,"2015-11-01",3.8,"Bottle. Pours black with a huge thick beige head. Aromas of coffee, licorice and spice. Flavors are coffee, dark chocolate, licorice and cola. Finishes with spice and a bit of pumpkin and biscuit. Assertively hopped, but not overpowering. Likewise, the pumpkin and spice are not overdone. Light, dry mouthfeel. Very nice.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Shot"
80,"2015-10-28",3.0,"Shared bomber poured to small snifters, displaying a black/brown hue, with a modest layer of brownish tan head foam, and spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was rather hoppy, with spice & flora that was more as grandmas soap/fels naptha. Medium bodied, the flavor was mellowed roast, no noticeable pumpkin, and hop bitterness that was roasted & earthy. The finish was dry, with a lingering, astringent bite. Didnt really work for me.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
80,"2015-10-26",3.6,"22 oz. bottle. It pours black with a tan head. The aroma has some strong cinnamon, ginger and allspice in that order. Maybe a hint of squash and a decent amount of hard roasted malt. The flavor is thankfully, less spiced and more roasted with some decent rich notes of caramel and cocoa. The finish is still hard roasted, but it falls short of being too ashy or dirty. The spices are pretty well balanced, but still a tad much for my palate. Overall, this was a solid pumpkin stout as they go... I think the oatmeal helped give it more body to support the roast and spice.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
80,"2015-10-24",3.3,"Aroma is a caramelized, burnt brown sugar with strong pumpkin and spice character. Deep brown-black with off-white head. Flavor is pumpkin plus burnt malt/sugar and an over spiced bitterness. I like this beer more than I can fairly rate it.

80,"2015-10-16",4.5,"Dark pour excellent head and Lace in glass. Smell sweet raisin and slight spice. Taste is LUXURIOUS if you like porters stouts and pumpkins done right. VERY creamy flavor no coffee no chocolate just deep roasted caramel. smooth. $4.99 20 oz bottle.... very mature and sophisticated. Quite Delicious. Not obnoxious for an oatmeal stout. If you bothered to read this, you might be like me looking for the best of the best in pumpkins this is one of them. Cant miss.","Texas, USA","VatMasterson"
80,"2015-10-08",3.5,"Pours a deep brown almost black color with a good pumpkin spice, gingerbread aroma. Taste of roasted malt, oatmeal, pumpkin, cinnamon with a bready aftertaste. A cerealflavor throughout as well, tasty.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"
80,"2015-10-04",4.0,"Bottle: &nbsp Nearly black,moderate foamy beige head, fairly nice lacing. &nbsp Very nice nose of spices, graham cracker, gingersnaps, and soft oatmeal. &nbsp Very spicy on the tongue, much like the nose. &nbsp This might be better than the original. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Nice spiciness on the finish. &nbsp This might be my favorite of 2015 yet! &nbsp Very well built, spices last, and its not one dimensional in that it has other things going on. &nbsp Nice Pumpkin Stout!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
80,"2015-10-02",3.8,"I'm not a fan per se of pumpkin beers, some of them can taste just downright awful because they're weighed down with flavoring or spice. This is by far my favorite pumpkin ale. It actually smells like pumpkin pie, with its wonderful aroma of just enough nutmeg and cinnamon to make you wish for homemade pumpkin pie. This beer is delightfully decadent, but not so much that it sits on the palate. Overall, I wish it were a bit darker, which may be its only downfall, but for six bucks and a 7.5% ABV, it's a steal

80,"2015-09-27",3.5,"Nice brew. Pours deep brown with a fluffy tan head. Aroma is primarily pumpkin spice with some light coffee notes. Medium body and smooth, with a light hop bite in the finish.","New Jersey, USA","abcfan"
80,"2015-09-26",3.1,"Aroma is oddly herbal and hoppy. Flavor lets the dark malts take over more. Moderate pie spice throughout. Easily better than their classic pumpkin.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
80,"2015-09-19",3.6,"Pour is a black with a huge overflowing tan head. Aroma is full on spice. Cinnamon and nutmeg are all over the place. Flavor is a nice rich and creamy roasted malt and the spice then come in to make this a super rich roasted oat and spiced beer. You get both the oatmeal stout aspect and also the pumpkin beer aspect. This was a solid beer. Plenty roasted and spiced.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
80,"2015-09-15",4.5,"Pours warm coffee brown with a thick and rather persistent frothy tan head. Cinnamon-infused pumpkin dominates the aroma, while roast malt, oatmeal and cloves provide backup notes. Flavor has a heart of roast malt and adds pumpkin, cinnamon, woody hops, cloves, oatmeal, and a touch of coffee. This is like the love child of a pumpkin pie and a robust craft-brewed stout. Firm body leaves pumpkin, cloves, hops and oatmeal in its wake, along with a fairly strong and persistent fizz. OK, so its not officially fall yet - but it sure felt like it this morning in Atlanta. Get pumped any time of year!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
80,"2015-09-10",3.6,"22oz bottle, split with Amy S. Up front, cool bigger gourdy pumpkiny flavor, and an interesting spice. Nice oatmeal, bit of earthy hop, good toastiness. Bitter dark chocolate, almost slightly burnt. Amy says this reminds her of the Epic pumpkin porter, rightly so. Maybe a bit less full-bodied than the Epic, a little bit more bitter and less sweet. Bit more spicy. Dark brown color, thin khaki head, leaves good bits of lace. Moderate to bigger bitter, lighter to moderate sweet. Solid, tasty pumpkin stout.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
