Couleur brun roux, à lopacité assez forte.

Arômes de fruits noirs, fleurs, cassis, houblon fleuri, malt grillé, fruit de la passion.

Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, bread, chocolate, pine and hops.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque ruby/dark brown beer with a slight/medium beige/brown head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, chocolate and pine; ends slightly bitter and dry with bread and hops.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. A lot of hops, especially for a brown ale, but it works great for both the aroma and flavour. The appearance is amazing, with a near infinite head. The beer could have had a thicker palate however.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Rustic, malty aroma of burning wood, roasted pinenuts, bitter chocolate, hazelnut oil, almonds, black pepper, dates, orange peel hops (more so than normal for the style), freshly grated nutmeg, ginger powder, cranberries, very attractive. Taste begins with a restrained, elegant fruitiness (berries, dates, perhaps a faint banana suggestion), medium carbonated, evolving into a gracious, lean, pleasantly nutty and somewhat caramelly maltiness, lightly toasted, supple and subduedly sweetish; finish is equally malty, with a fair amount of peppery and earthy hop bitterishness on top of it, more so than usual for this style.

Aroma - the aroma is full of potent and oily West Coast hops, roasted burn, and alcohol.
Appearance - the body is dark brown; liquid is clean, but difficult to see as it is almost opaque; the heady is cream colored and beautifully rocky - with a massive set-up! It takes it quite some time to settle. There is also full Betty Page stocking show skirting the glass.
Taste - the beer is bitter, with big California hops - there is also buckets of roast, caramelized sugars, licorice, coffee, and some alcohol.
Palate - body is medium to full; the texture somewhat oily, somewhat creamy, somewhat slick; the carbonation is average, but finishes a little more lively on the sides of the tongue; the finish is bitter and roasty and very long.

Mikkeller always exciting stuff, this isnt what Id normally think of when I think of Brown Ale, and I let it show in aroma and taste - taking away a point on each of those qualitative measures. Otherwise, this was a bodacious beer.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

Ridiculous light tan head, almost half the glass, like I was making an ice cream float or something. Head takes 5-10 minutes to subside to 1/2cm and it has left a sticky mess all over the vacated glass. Aroma is pine or evergreen, hops. Maybe a little wood as noted by other reviewers. Taste is less hoppy than nose. Darker malty tastes show up, a little roasty. The hops are sort of on the outside of the mouthful, and reveals itself on the back end. Possibly in the universe of Anchor Brekles Brown or similar, a hoppy brown ale. Not amazing but good, and nice (for me) to start venturing out of Mikkeller darker heavier things.

2003,"2012-12-08",2.7,"750 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, best before 2/3/2011.  Pours lightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers.  Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass.  Aromas of big apple skins, pear, herbal, and yeasty phenols; with slight notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, and light roasted malt.  Pretty bad aromas here; this one definitely went south on the store shelf.  Mostly fruity phenols and hardly anything else.  Taste of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toast, bread, apple, pear, light char, and herbal spiciness.  Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel roasted malt, toast, bread, light fruits, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a bit.  Taste was quite a bit better than the aromas would imply; but there was still some phenolic fruitiness noticed, and it was a bit unbalanced.  Flavor felt a bit watered down.  Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is ok.  Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this was a pretty poor brown ale, the bottle obviously went south.  Aromas had zero brown ale characteristics, but the flavors were a bit closer.  I was able to finish this bottle slowly; and I wont hold this against the brewer, as it was obviously the fault of storage temperature and age.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Medium body, soft carbonation. Taste is dry malty with a powerful hop bitterness - leaving a rough tongue, but well-balanced by discreet sweetness and acidity.","NORWAY","berlinoise2go"

Solid brown pour with lots of reds under the light and a big, thick cream head that billows, lasts forever and laces all over the place. Theres no other way for me to describe this aroma... foreign. It has that sour, fruity, tangy, and slightly metallic aroma that I commonly find in these beers, and often in foreign export stouts. Anyway, theres also a touch of chocolate and nuttiness. Its in the flavor as well... a slightly metallic, tangy fruitiness that hits the tongue. The flavor shows more than the aroma, though. Beyond that initial hit, I get roast, chocolate, nuttiness, and lingering dusty chocolate and coffee. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

Somewhat floury aroma feels like a good imperial stout. It has chocolate, cocoa, coffee and some fruity hops. Flavour is a bit odd and thin with coffee, chocolate, peanuts and hops. Coffee gets stronger towards the dryish and nutty finish. I aged this on purpose to see what lies behind the hops  and I think I like it! Some sour notes start to occur towards the end of the glass, luckily I didnt age this further.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
2003,"2011-12-21",4.5,"I can smell favorite hops, sweet flowery hops. Taste is lightly roasted malts, floweryness from hops. Light body roasty taste which turns from flowers to bitterness. I like this mix of roast and hops. Great success from Mikkeller

Hops! Simcoe is really growing on me, and this beer is a great use of them. Little citrusy, and floral bouquet outshine the slight malty aroma.
Hoppy again. The hops really coat the mouth and linger throughout the entire drink. But this is a good thing here. It doesnt annoy with the loitering hop character, just makes you want to take another sip to see if it is real. Slightly sweet.
Slightly thin. But I dont know if I would like it to be thicker. It fits the taste profile, which might get overpowered if it were to have any more body. The sweetness would also be amplified.

In the middle is a strange astringency, then a finish of hop bitterness and roast. The middle kills this one for me. Seems like a hop attribute, and feels really out of place for me.

The head mostly remains and leaves a large amount of fine lace. The nose has big notes of hops, caramel and molasses, along with toasted malts, coffee and anise. The flavour is moderately-intensely bitter with a complex hop bouquet, balanced against a moderate roasty maltiness. The finish is long and hoppy bitter with a touch of acidity. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, milky texture and moderate, biting carbonation. Overall, this is a very well made brown ale with an intense dose of hops. It is more acidic and bitter than any other brown ale I can recall, but the package all fits together well. A hopheads brown ale. 2011-01-26","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

For a brown ale it is very hoppy, not that surprising for a Mikkeller brew though, and I love it! The caramel and chocolate malts are also there, teasing the nose with their presence. It pours a murky brown colour with a thick foam that leaves a lot of lacing, again, the mind turns to chocolate. The taste is sweet and hints of coffee and chocolate from the malts and finishes off with a nice, round, hoppy bitterness in the ending.

Nose: nuts, chocolate, and toast all roasted to crispy crunchy perfection. Hops in the back with a hint of greenness; green grass and green bark. Raisins. Light and airy essence. Brittle chocolate bars and soft chocolate cake complement each other. Nuts crunchy while hops soothe.

Palate: fantastic! Grabs top of my tongue and doesnt let go not even once until of her brown beery nectar has vacated my glass for my tummy. Tons of chocolate; cake, graham crackers, truffles (powder), bars, nibs. Hops provide an exquisite level of balance in the back for a tryst of bitter hops green and fresh with bitter burnt chocolate and nutty malts. Refreshing and thirst-inducing. Dry tobacco leaf of cigar and pipe regard flitters around the edges and tinges my breath. Green wood and green bark lurks in the back, observing more than partaking.

Final Thoughts: once more the roving brewer strikes a home-run in my tasting book. Mikkeller is truly a brewmaster of finesse, ingenuity, and a dab of eccentricity which I am all the more happy to indulge in with each and every beer. Bring it on, I say.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Aroma: There is a nice touch of lightly roasted malt, a nice nuttiness and an earthy herbal hop note.

Taste: All the attributes from the nose are present in the taste plus some cocoa notes.  The hops are a little more forward than usual in the style, but its a nice switch.  
Palate: Medium bodied but it feels lighter due to a higher than normal level of carbonation.  The finish is slightly bitter and nutty.

2003,"2010-07-19",3.7,"Whoa! This is an overload on the senses. You can tell that there really is a decent amount of malt in there but theres enough hops to mistake it for an IIPA by the nose. Poured with a huge almost 2 inch head of nice creamy foam on top. Still cant tell of the lacing, it hasnt died down yet. Is indeed very brown, not too dark to see that. After a few more sips the malts start to come out at the beginning but wow do the hops ever pick up and take off with it. This is quite good, but I really couldnt call it a brown ale if I brewed it. It would have to be called India Brown Round (trip) or something, IBR for short; when you drink it it seems like a misrepresentation of brown ale to score this well in that category. After my mouth has gotten used to it the hops now seem more balanced against the malts but this is a beer for all the hop heads out there.

2003,"2010-04-16",3.7,"Bottle.

A - Dark, murky reddish-copper brown color. Average sized creamy off-white to light beige colored head. Decent retention and a bit below average speckled lacing left.

S - Pretty strong coffee along with some herbal/floral hop aroma. Some chocolate and cocoa smells are in the background along with some nutty, earthy, and woody smells. Fair amount of malty smell is also drifting between the foreground and the background.

T - Strong kick of coffee and to a slightly lesser extent chocolate right away. Then some of that herbal/floral and some earthy hop flavors come in that provide a fairly bitter taste. Mid-sip some more of the earthy/woody flavors start to come out along with some grainy malts and more coffee and (again to a lesser extent) chocolate. These provide for more of a burnt/roasted bitterness. Once the hops present themselves, they never really leave, just go more in the background. Fairly bitter beer, especially for a Brown Ale.

M - Medium body with slightly below average carbonation. Drying but provides a sharp kick.

D - The flavors are enjoyable, but they can get to be a bit too much and overbearing. I dont know if I would want to drink more than one in a night. 

Notes: Interesting take on a Brown Ale, as this is quite bitter. Both from roasted flavors and from a good amount of hops. The coffee flavor is pretty dominant throughout but not so much that it completely hides the other flavors. Nice beer that I enjoyed, but I dont know if I will try again, probably if I find it for a good price I would.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Aromas of chocolate and cocoa mix with a hoppiness that reminds me of freshly cracked spruce needles and freshly cut apricots - really nice. Espresso-like roasted malt flavour with woody, grassy and subtle alcoholic notes. Very rough bitterness and roasty acidity with a mild carbonation, mouthfeel is actually quite light.

Lots of herbal, sprucey citrus hops on the aroma up front. If I dig a little deeper I get some weak chocolate, nuts, and roast, but not much. Flavor is an inherent earthy and herbal hop without much of a malt backing. There is a light nutty toast, chocolate, and roast, but not much. Finishes with a dry, slightly resiny citrus and lingers with lots of herbal bite for a good amount of time. A hint of astringent roast comes through in the finish as well. Medium body with a creamy carbonation. Overall, disappointing. Almost no sweetness to accompany the hops and barely a trace of roasty chocolate.

A decent nut aroma coming through. Very pungent brew. I am not a fan of the fact that the hops are so present, but this might be a positive note on the flavor. The flavor is, in my mind, excellent. Nice nutty, roast, malty flavor. The hops provide an excellent backing to this beer. Nice subtle coffee flavor as well. I dont think they could have done a better job on a brown.

2003,"2009-07-22",3.9,"BB 2-9-11.  Pours a nearly opaque, rusty brown color with a massive, khaki, creamy, fluffy, float-like head which lasts for a long while but does finally rescinds allowing me to take a sniff while showing some lace rings.  The nose is complex and fairly hoppy, especially for a brown ale, much like a brown IPA or pale; notes of centennial and simcoe hops with a rustic tone, some light floral, light orange peel, dark bread crust, roasted pecans, some malted notes, and light notes of kona coffee and chocolate; a lot going on in the nose but everything works well together.  The flavor is nice but not matching the nose, dry, hoppy flavor with some dry malt notes as well.  Noting a more-than-moderate, herbal hop bitterness and light coffee bitterness throughout with other notes of light dry grass, malted cocoa, light grapefruit peel, pecans, and similar bread crust notes.  Moving into the finish I get just hints of anise and dark chocolate.  Palate is a little watery, silky, less-than-medium, and soft to lively, oh yeah, and dry; silky and dry in the same palate??  The finish is dry, moderately bitter still with some lighter sweet notes of the dark chocolate and light anise, light coffee bitterness, some lingering herbal/floral hop bitterness, and dark bread crusts still continuing to sit on the tongue.  I do not know where to begin with this one; an excellent, intriguing nose with some dissimilar flavors that seem to fit perfectly together but the flavor carries so many dry notes which overwhelm the nice complexities of the beer.  If I had to change something with the beer, I would say maybe changing the nugget to something less bitter thus allowing more sweet malt notes to emerge and less dry, bitter notes.  Either way, a great brown ale with an intoxicating nose.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Great aromas of ghaggghhhhhllll (yes, this is the sound I made upon first smelling it - its a good sound, I swear), very weak coffee blended with the dark citrus hops really make this beer exceptionable, dirty, dusty chocolate, almost has an american barley wine smell, fake blueberry, there is also something here that, if it had a hell of a lot more power would be pretty stinky - either way, its making my mouth water. Nice flavours of roasted malts, caramel, weak but bitter coffee, bakers chocolate, unsweetened grapefruit hops dominate the hop portion with slight apricot, weak spruce and a medicinal quality finishing off that feature. Some earthy nuances, more dark fruit when warmer. Finishes less than impressive - the bitterness almost nullifies the goodness. Medium to medium full bodied, Lengthy drying bitterness.

2003,"2009-04-10",4.0,"1 pint .9 fl oz bottle.  I love the hop character right away but this is what id expect from Mikkeller.  Very pleasant and well balanced aroma, with a good amount of almond nuttiness, roasty caramels, coffee, chocolate, pale malt, earth, spruce, and tangy citrus, with each aspect contributing a rather equal amount to the smell.  Pretty looking pour as well, the head is large, rather thick, and creamy tan while the body looks much less dense but definitely not light, and honey brown in color.  A great creamy feel on the body that would be otherwise fairly subdued without the strong hop presence that builds as the swallow goes forth.  Much of the similar balance seen in the aroma comes forth in the taste as well.  It starts out more rich roasted caramel nutty with some coffee, mixed cereal, and licorice, with a wave a bitterness coming in shorty after with more herbal citrus notes than the aroma, some acidic grapefruit that combines with the more roasted coffee/brown malts to make a very solid finish and linger.  This really is a brown ale done right.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"
2003,"2009-03-28",3.8,"500ml bottle.
Served chilled in a mug.
Pours a creamy inch of tan head atop a deep copper-brown body.
Rich nose packed full of roasted malts; burnt toffee, chocolate, coffee, touch of charcoal, with resiny hop citrus cutting through very nicely.
Good thick mouthfeel, smooth texture, carbonation quite soft. Lengthy agressive bitterness cuts through early on and hangs on, and on...
A good battle is fought between hop and malt balance. Plenty of chocolatey maltiness, a touch of liquorice, toffee and coffee in the mix, assaulted by grapefruit, unripe stonefruit, grass and resineous leafiness of the hops. Hugely drawn out finish, slight grain astrigency and assertive bitterness linger, begging for more liquid...luckily my glass aint empty yet!
A very full on American-style Brown ale. Id argue that the malt and hop flavours are nice but a bit incoherent together, but I really enjoyed it!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Still, a fine beer that I will buy pretty much whenever I see it.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
2003,"2008-08-17",3.7,"Bottle purchased at Sam’s Wine & Spirits in Chicago. Pours a hazy chocolate brown with a loose, fluffy, light tan head that diminishes leaving sticky lace on the mug. The nose is of roasty, chocolate malt backed by faint coffee, ""green""/floral hops and light anise; interesting. Medium-bodied and slick with a bitter-hopped and roasty finish. Roasted chocolate malt, coffee and solid, resinous hops. The hops certainly dominate on this one. I’d be curious to see if allowing this one a bit of time to age would balance it out a bit. It’s very good as it is, but I would enjoy a bit more malt in the flavor profile.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
2003,"2008-08-12",4.0,"04-Aug-08 (500-ml bottle: Purchased 07-Apr-08 for $9.96 from liquidsolutions.biz)  Mikkeller continues to shine, pushing the envelope with wonderfully flavorful brews, and Jackie Brown is no exception.  The nose offers strong, roasty malts and coffee, but also a prominent outdoor theme of earth, twigs and leaves along with a rustic suggestion of farms, barns and pastures.  The flavor is very roasty for a brown ale, lightly sweet, fairly nutty, with strong dark chocolate and coffee notes in the finish.  Hops are dusty and lightly bitter, but the flavor of the hops has significant presence in the finish.  Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste from hops and dark-roasted malts.  Full-bodied on the palate, almost chewy, it’s much heavier than most brown ales, and the mouthfeel is smooth and velvety.  Carbonation is light-medium.  Despite the lightly sweet overtone, the beer is very dry and somewhat tannic and chalky on the palate, especially in the finish.  Medium brown in color with good clarity.  The small, light-tan head builds to no more than half an inch on the pour before settling to a partial film and wide ring.  A really wonderful brown ale, without a doubt one of the best I’ve ever tasted.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
2003,"2008-08-11",3.8,"Bottle.  Clear, brown pour.  Large, frothy, light tan head.  Nutty aroma with roasted malt hints for good measure.  Flavor is rich and roasted malt.

2003,"2008-08-01",3.6,"Rating 100!!  Only took me about 4 years to get!!!  
Aroma is pretty good, little chocolaty, good amount of licorice, and some nuttiness.  Appearance is spot on, its brown, well carbonated and clear.  Flavor is solid, I get some nuttiness, a little licorice backed up with a malty backbone.  I do get some astringency in the finish which is a shame.  The description mentions a good amount of hop bitterness, but Im not noticing too much hops with this beer.   Mouthfeel is alright, body is a little light for what I would expect based on the aroma and taste. Carbonation is good.  Again, get a bit of astringency in the finish.  Overall, not bad, aroma is great, appearance is spot on, flavor and palate are a bit marred by a bit of astringency.  Its worth trying at least.","San Diego, California, USA","giarcsr"

Smell: An aromatic blend of chocolate, rich coffee, and oven-toasted nuts with a woody, spicy hop character.

Taste: Malts tasting of roasted nuts and unsweetened chocolate with a strong graininess and a distinct coffee flavor. Almost no sweetness present. Spicy hop with an encroaching woodiness and moderate bitterness. A good measure of bitter and roast on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.

Drinkability: No thanks. Try as I might, I just simply wasn’t enamored with this one. The in-your-face roasted graininess really starts to grate on the palate after awhile.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Was a little taken a back by the hops at first but then I remembered it was a Mikkeller brew.  Aroma is a little citrus hop and some roasted chocolate malt.  Pretty unique and interesting combo.  Chocolate flavors on the front palate and then the citrusy hop finish are pretty interesting and unconventional for a brown ale but work well here.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
2003,"2008-07-27",3.7,"Bottle: Pours a deep ebony mahogany color with a huge puffy tan head that stays put for a while, thick lacing and plenty of carbonation. The nose is roasty with a snap of hops, bitter chocolate and light roasted coffee. More sweet and aromatic than dark and menacing. Ample chocolate malts, minimal patents. The flavor is especially bitter but it balances up the roasty astringency and after the battle is over, you’re left with a light sweet coffee roast note on your palate that’s along. Simply to be enjoyed as is. The finish brings out more bitterness so you’re constantly wanting another drink to stay in the roasty purgatory in between bitterness. Refreshing and thought provoking.

The head is soft and tightly bubbled - light egg-whites. It leaves a lot of thick, uneven patches and legs of lace all over the glass. The aroma is astounding - the perfect blend of citrus hops, coffee and roasted grains, and dark caramel. The flavor starts quite hoppy with citrus/grapefruit flavors. As the beer slides toward mid-palate, the roasted grain and chocolate flavors slowly build. At mid-palate there is a pleasant mix of citrusy bitter hops and roasted grains. The finish is dry and hoppy with a strong hop bitterness and a deep, coffee-like, roasted grain flavor. The mouthfeel is medium in body and somewhat creamy. The carbonation level is firm but not too vigorous. Overall, a nice beer - much hoppier and much more citrus than I was expecting. It could use a little less bitterness and a touch more chocolate/nutty character, considering it is suppoed to be a brown ale. But still, a very tasty offering.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

2003,"2008-05-29",3.9,"Pours a dark mahogany brown with a rocky off white head that dissipates to wisp of foam on top leaving very good lacing.  The smell surprised me with the hops, much hoppier than the normal American brown with the big fresh pine hops popping up front.  There is also a slight burnt coffee smell with chocolate as well all on top of a faint sweet malt background.  There is a more pronounced roasted malt flavor up front than in the aroma, but that is really just an intro to the big piny fresh hop flavor.  The coffee and chocolate are still there but more in the background in the taste.  The finish is back to the hop bitterness, almost an IPA-like aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation and the hoppiness tingles the tongue more than just about any brown Ive tasted.  This is one of the more interesting brown ales Ive tasted as Mikkeller has amped up the hoppiness in this one.  Drinkability is probably a little diminished by the hop bitterness, but not too bad.

Pours with a frothy, tan colored head that is somewhat large bubbled, but .  The beer is a rusty, dark brown color, but shows a brilliantly clear, cranberry hue when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite malty, but still has a hoppy edge to it.  Chewy malt aromatics remind me of light, but definitely roasted coffee beans, well toasted bread crust, big chewy brown malt aromas and some sweet caramel.  The hop character provides a backdrop of herbal pine and some citrus fruit notes (but this is hard to pick out from the roast grain notes).  The brown malt character in this beer is huge, though the chocolate malt plays a big role here too; very roasty, very coffee like.

Fizzy with a bit more carbonation than is needed, but a quick swirl of my glass takes care of that.  As I swirl I get aromas of cherries and musty malt.  Fairly dry tasting (especially with all the roast character), but it does have a touch of soft, caramelized malt character that adds just a touch of sweetness before the darker malt character kicks in and dries the finish out.  Speaking of the finish, the roast character is quite prominent here providing a mix of flavors ranging from espresso, a light burnt acidity, a touch of charcoal, toasted bread, some burnt grain husk astringency.  There is still some hop character left in the flavor too; there is a definite bitterness, but there is also a citrus character (tangelo & bergamot) that is noticeable at times, and a pine like character seems to always form a subtle backdrop to each sip.

This is a surprisingly roast flavored beer for the color, I think that the brown malt is the likely culprit as somehow a little of this goes a long way.  A tasty brew though that has a nice, perceived dryness to it because of all of the roast character.  This is a very tasty beer that is aging quite well, all this roast character could have this easily going a couple more years.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The aroma is hops, yeast, roasted darkness, smoke, and freshly pulled resinous ganja (in theory, not practice).  The flavor has lots fresh tasting hops, anise, solid roasted malts, inevitable ale fruit notes, more bitterness, and just overall very delicious.  This is an awesome Brown, but so hard to rate after the awesome beers Ive rated this evening.  Of note here are the hops that taste so fresh against the chocolate and coffee backbone.

Perhaps its just because im not that fond of this kind of beer. But it was nothing specail, and it felt like i could get somewhat the same taste from ordinary beers in a way cheaper price category. If i disregard price the beerr is okay, drinkable, nice, quite good. quite bitter and smoked. The other mikkeler ive tasted have been a lot better.

i guess its the uncompromized mix of bitterness and a hint of burnt woodness that turns me off. Perhaps the alc.% is too low??","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pinball"
2003,"2008-02-22",3.9,"The aroma was roasty with a strong dark chocolate impression and a presence of coffee, espresso coffee, through the beige frothy, moussy and tall head. The aroma showcased dark chocolate, coffee, and a presence of dark fruits, raisins and prunes, as the head slowly retreated. Some grassy hop presence was notable as well. The beer poured into the glass crystal clear amber brown with that huge head which laced the glass till it begged for mercy. The flavor was bitter with grassy and citrusy bittering kicking you in the teeth. The resinous hop profile was somewhat unexpected after an aroma filled with chocolate and coffee. The flavor contained coffee, espresso coffee, once again, but more prevalent was the aggressive bittering which was resinous and grassy and had a bit of citrus hop flavor. The finish was bone dry with lasting hop flavor and bittering long into the aftertaste with a eventual flavor of coffee in the finality of the flavor. The body was medium with a moderate level of carbonation. No appreciable alcohol was notable.

Smooth, near-medium body finishes slightly dry and tingly. Mixed feelings about how to rate this nice-enough tasting session ale.

The woody hops are so present that it almost gives the beer a barrel-like flavour.

2003,"2007-05-20",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2008 My Bottom Line:
Wet herbal hops and their inherent earthiness swerve around the roasted maltiness and its accompanying chestnuts. A flavorful pint of Brown Ale this is, which gains cohesion, balance and wealth after a few months of aging.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam sits atop the limpid brown ochre, lacing nicely.
-The effervescent carbonation enlightens the healthy maltiness.
-The fruity nuttiness is a little too shy and dry for my tastes in the style.
-The dry, resinous, earthy hop bitterness is rather important.
-A citrusy character rises from the hops.

2003,"2007-02-02",4.0,"Bottle (Sydney Summer Gathering 2007): Brown ales were my first love. Sadly, as I explored the mountains and watercourses of the fermented world my passion for them waned. I found it was an empty category, not because the style was flawed, but simply because no one was producing anything of quality. However, this has rekindled the fire.Rusty brown with a solid off-white head, but unlike most other brown ales I have tried, this one has presence in the glass. In the nose things become more intriguing. Very slight roasty notes play under a lovely chocolate chorus. I was smitten here probably, but the real fire came from within. Bitter cocoa and toasty malts race accross the palate, kept in check by a pleasing bitterness from a combination of the chocolate and the malts, but also, as it moved from front to back-palate, an increasingly obvious piney hop character. Resiny flavours joined the fray very late, and despite a previous prejudice against such additions, I was in love. Oh please can we have more brewers paint such pictures.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Aarleks"

The aroma is very good even though it is this beers vulnerable point, and has lot of sweet chocolate, and aroma hops. The flavor is just perfect for a brown ale. As always with Mikkellers beer (although I have only thried 3 different), there is a distinct hops profile from the start to the end, and in every little ""corner"" of this beers oily and full-bodied palate the hops are obvious. There is a lot of chocolate, both the dark bitter version and some sweet chocolate, but also a subdued amount of coffee, and a very nice bitter hops finish.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"
