$20.20 for the 4pack. 
 Pours a pristine cream yellow. Still-intact white wine-like beer head plateaus its horizons.  Aromas of pineapples, sawdust, spring flowers, tulips, wheat bread.  Ponderous and lovely.  The flavor brings everything mentioned above back into the equation with the simple addition of artichoke hearts, pea water, chives, and white pottery clay featured most prominently at its triumphant swallow.  The almost-medicinal herbal bitterness lingers like a former significant other who had been creepily looking at you as they shop three aisles behind your cart.  A potent peppery bong hit, unripe grapefruit, roasted poppy seeds, sourdough starters, and guava skins experience at near-finish.  A devilishly good product, but far bitterer than I want for my IPA formula.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

The nose is lemon and grapefruit peel with a pronounced white peach skin aroma, with a lightly floral green grass note. The flavor is even more peach skin, mango skin, and citrus peel, with the same, very pleasant floral grassy note, and balancing bitterness.

Has some big green garlic, onion hop tones as well as some faded Mosaic and steady Columbus. The malt backdrop comes off a little thin and sugary to me, murked a little by the wheat.

3843,"2016-10-03",4.6,"At Barts Trillium & Tree House tasting in Bruges. New version of Melcher Street with very thin, snow white, lightly lacing head only retaining on the edge, hazy peach blonde colour, warm and lightly orangey. Wonderful aroma bursting with hints of pink grapefruit flesh, green banana, yellow kiwi, mango, moist curry spices, vanilla, passion fruit lemonade, watermelon. Lively fruity onset, kiwi, mango, tamarillo, medium carbo, supple mouthfeel, lightly bready middle with a soapy hint, full and smooth, biscuity touch, utterly aromatic finish with spicy and drying hop bitterness but nothing harsh, perfectly in tune with the rest of the palate, sweet exotic curry spiciness, touch vanilla, mango and grapefruit peel retronasally, very rich and satisfying. Trillium is always great but to my personal palate, this is likely the best of their many masterpieces I had the pleasure to taste so far - or in fact, one of the best American style IPAs tout court.

Une petite dose damertume arrive en fin de bouche mais cest somme toute léger. La bière est certainement bien faite, mais il me semble quil me manque quelque chose pour que ce soit wow.

Mouth is a bit drier with lots of tropical fruits (mango, guava, passion fruit). Musty too, with some vitamin/mineral. Superior to King Julius by a few points, and better than Scaled too which was not quite as interesting. Not sure I prefer it to standard Melcher Street though.

La Signature de La Maison est ici fidèlement respectée malgré le caractère très unique de ce bouquet olfactif. Une formidable quantité doignons verts, de ciboulette et dail émanent de mon verre! Jamais je nai respiré de houblons aussi précis dans cette direction. Ça sent la cuisine, vraiment. Quelques notes dagrumes et de pain frais également mais ces autres aspects sont ici beaucoup moins spectaculaires. Ce cocktail est ici parfaitement aromatique. Absolument aucune amertume; une texture laiteuse grâce à de douces levures tranquilles. Je bois littéralement un jus concocté à base doignons et de ciboulette. Un très curieux chef-doeuvre!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3843,"2016-03-04",4.2,"750 ml bottle spilt by Brian, thanks Willrunforbeer. Yet another top notch brew. Bottled on 2/2/2016... Unfiltered golden/ yellow color, very thin lasting. Aroma is off the chain Mosaic hops in Spades. Grassy, scallion and bold floral goodness. < br>
 Is this grassy? Yes... It is. Is this maybe a little more malty then it should be? No, no it is not. The hops are long, grassy and cat piss like. Yeah, Danky. The texture is borderline on the juicy but turns drier toward the backend of the sip. My god why am I still drinking beer outside of New England?? I got top breweries in any direction. Thanks Brian!","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

3843,"2015-10-15",3.8,"bottle thanks to Alex. Im afraid this might be a little old, light aroma for trillium standards, and especially a double dry hopped. The base is light and dry, a little biscuity. Very clean, like Kernel IPAs. Hops are grass and citrus.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3843,"2015-10-10",4.4,"first impression was the superb nose, a blast of dank and fruity hop goodness.

Great stuff.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

3843,"2015-05-19",5.0,"Wow, this beer reminds me so much of Heady Topper. This is the quintessential New England IPA. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange zest, pith, dose of hop spice, bit of pine, big and juicy. Way too easy drinking, like I wanna chug it, easy drinking for 7.2%. Pours a hazy medium yellow with decent sized head and lacing. Just an amazing beer. LOVE it. About as perfect as an IPA can be.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
3843,"2015-04-10",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2016 Draught at Publick House, Trillium 2nd Annviersary, 3/23/15Deep golden-copper pour shows this isnt a Congress Street or Fort Point malt bill. Head is medium-sized, white and moderately well-retained. Liquid is moderately hazy.More specialty malts in this one, at least to some extent, and it shows in the nose, adding a touch of caramel and bread to the otherwise heavily fruity (cherries, oranges, ruby red grapefruit) hop assortment. No alcohol or flaws in the nose.Surprisingly tame in the flavor department. Sweeter than I would have expected, with more residual sugar than Id prefer, even if it does mean zero resin burn. Very low bitterness, with predominantly cherry and candied orange hop flavors with a dash of tropical fruits thrown in. Caramel and honey build up on the palate and there is very little bitterness to combat it. Eventually, all I really taste is a canned pineapple-like flavor that is heavily sweet and very off-putting.  Looking at other ratings, I see mention of garlic and onions which is spot on.  Was going to say it tasted ""meaty"" but garlic is precisely it.  Oddly enough that person still gave it a 4.3!  I like garlic/onion flavor in my beer less so than him/her, I guess!  7/3/6/3/11Canned 8/31/16, drunk 9/16/16.A much-needed rerate here and its funny seeing my comments for my first time trying this as being very off-put by the garlic/onion character.  Not sure if my palate has grown more accustomed to it (probably) or if that batch had some older/less-desirable hops in it.  Whatever the case, while I can still sometimes pick out suggestions of garlic/scallion from some of these new hop breeds, I dont find it very overt or frequent.  That being said, I still feel about the same with this as I do with the regular Melcher Street; rather sweet/muchy and overly given to over-ripe nectarine/peach.  Its a good, solid, drinkable beer, dont get me wrong, but not up there with their best, IMHO.  Malty and wheat-flour-laden texture, with fine carbonation and decent attenuation (still a bit too sweet, I think).  Needs a little less pine character, as well.  Score is for this incarnation.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3843,"2015-03-25",4.3,"Fresh growler (32 oz) enjoyed @ 10:30 a.m. at the hotel before EBF. Massive thanks to Brian for this one!

Appearance: Hazy glowing yellow with a medium persistent white head and good lacing. 

Aroma: Massive onions and garlic presence, but in a really nice way. Super juicy dank. Theres also a bit of herbal presence, some citrus/melons and tropical fruits. 

Taste: Super juicy hops and, here again, a nice massive onions/garlic presence. Efficient but subtle malt backbone, some resin, tropical fruits, herbal notes and light bitterness. 

Palate: Medium body. Soft to moderate carbonation. Juicy and oily mouthfeel. A bit fluffy/aerated too. Long lasting danky and juicy onions and garlic finish. Quite dry too. 

Overall: Its the first time I try a beer that is so onions and garlic forward and I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I did. And its still super well balanced. Super juicy and dank. Really tasty. Unique. Alcohol is well hidden. Really drinkable. One of my favorite IPA/DIPA ever.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Pretty much a perfect aroma of grapefruits, clementines, lemons along with just a little yeasty beeriness. The flavor is unfortunately a little unbalanced, almost TOO much hop with a cut grass/torn leaf flavor that isnt apparent in the aroma. Other than that its quite good with lots of citrus and some dry cracker malt to balance out all the hops. Soft mouthfeel with some lingering bitterness. Definitely want to try the regular Melcher Street, but pretty damn happy with this one too.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"
