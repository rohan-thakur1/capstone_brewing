Verrücktes Bier für verrückte Leurte, so heißt wohl der Wahlspruch von Sam Calagiones Leute und hier trift das voll zu. Kardamon, Koriander, Wachholderbeeren, Schwarze Tee werden mit heißen Flußsteinen in den Gärbottichen geworfen und ergeben ein eher süßliches, fast schon ein Weihnachtsbier. Spannend und komplex!

2572,"2017-05-21",3.6,"Bottle courtesy of TATTORSO. Thanks Jeff!

A light hazy orange golden colour, it gives about an inch of foam and has some nice sticky lacing.

Ok, the smell really is different. Im getting some spice like cinnamon and nutmeg, grain and what must be the Chai that they speak of, juniper...weird smelling and Im not sure how to react. If this nose is to the style, I cant knock it. Actually, the more whiffs I take, the more it grows on me. 

The taste is honey sweet with a graininess, chai(?), strong spiciness(see smell), some banana flavour....as weird a taste as the smell. 

Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Plenty of warming is now sneaking up on me.

Drinkability? Im totally mixed in my feelings about the smell and taste but one thing is clear to me. This is a unique brew and in its uniqueness, I cant see myself having this one again but I thank Jeff for giving me a chance to try it.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"

2572,"2014-06-20",3.9,"Transfer from BA review from 7-2-12 - 
Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Pours a hazy golden color with a light white head. The head fades quickly leave a light amount of lacing.

Smell  The smell is fruity and spicy. Aromas of citrus and berry are a nice base with which aromas of some juniper spice and a light pine aroma rest upon. Mixed with these are smells of yeast and some light breadiness as well. 

Taste  The taste starts out on the fruitier and sweet side with a good dose of citrus and some berry flavors. These are mixed with juniper and some yeast tastes. The juniper soon becomes more potent with other spices of nutmeg and cinnamon coming to the tongue as well. As the taste advances further a herbal tea flavor comes to the tongue and takes the taste to the end where some floral flavors mix in with the herbal tea to leave a very interesting flavor on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on the medium side with the carbonation level just a hint above average. The average body was good for the tea, spice and fruit flavors with the carbonation level making it more refreshing then a standard 9 % abv brew.

Overall  It was an interesting and tasty brew. One to try if you get a chance.","","Darkmagus82"

2572,"2014-01-18",3.9,"Thanks to Hopswagger for this one!
750ml bottle served in a Duvel tulip
Bottled in 2010

A - Burnt orange color with a tight knit head. The head sinks into a collar while finally vanishing.

S - Lactic sourness and lavender salts are the first thing that jumps out. Smells like this will be quite tart. Dried plantains, strawberries, peach, apricots, spicy, ginger, pepper, nutmeg, lavender, rye bread, heavy dose of cardamon. Salty savory and sweet biscuit/bread malts.

T - Peach, apricot, and plantain puree, a soft lactic tartness is there but not as pronounced as the nose described. Lemons, pepper, cardamon, nutmeg, honey, ginger, salty, you can really taste the chai in there. Very yeasty with sweet and indulgent and earthy pale malts. A steady herbal note right through the middle, woody, Im guessing the juniper? Finishes with a fruity tartness and notes of salt, spice, and mint left on the aftertaste.

M - Hefty body makes for a thick feel, semi-dry finish.

The aroma is bigtime! Acidic fruit, spices, sweet and savory, very aromatic. The flavor follows but doesnt quite live up to the aroma.Very good mix of sweet and salty flavors. Big malt presence with lively yeast esters. Various spices that show up at different times. This would obviously pair excellent with Indian food or other curry dishes.

2572,"2014-01-17",4.4,"I had this in a mug due to Sahti recommendations. The appearance was a nice light yet hazy golden yellow/amber colored looking body with a one finger white foamy head that dies into the body within about thirty seconds. No lacing whatsoever. The aroma has one of the best parts of this beer and I absolutely love this (unsure how close this is truly to its style), but I get some juniper berries coming through in a earthy sort of way and I do get the cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and black pepper all coming through in a super nice way. The taste is spicy sweet through the previously mentioned flavors, I have to admit I do get the German yeastiness in the taste though I didnt notice it in the smell - still good; sticky sweet yet somewhat spicy aftertaste; dry sweet yet spicy finish. On the palate, she sits about a light to medium, ABV really isnt noticed, sessionable - hmmm...maybe slightly, carbonation is really smooth - I like it, but my lack of having ""sahtis"" doesnt say enough for me to tell you how good this is for its style, sorry, Ill try to find more as I can.

Taste/feel: Tea with a tangy Belgian characteristic. Berries. Somebody mentioned cinnamon, and I got that as well. Not bitter in the slightest.

This is my first Sahti so I have nothing to compare it to directly (within the style) but I point to other styles that I know for some comparison. I think that it might be closest to a Belgian blonde (maybe a Leffe?) but that it is maltier and with more of a spice profile. Excellent taste.","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

2572,"2012-09-26",3.5,"March 28th, 2010 - A Finnish proto-beer! And the recipe for this brew looks like a witchs potion! I wonder if Ill even have the sensory capacity to parse this brew out, but I barrel ahead, eager to dip into Dogfish Heads latest adventuresome brew. The body is a slightly hazy pumpkin orange color, blossoming with a thick, almost golden ahead. It also smells like a pumpkin seasonal beer. Of all the spices listed in the commercial description, it is easiest to pick out the smell of chai tea. That must be the cardamom, coriander and Indian black tea talking (is that 9th century Finnish?), but this beer is already taking on a sub-continent flavor that I find fascinating and mildly Orientalist in thinking. The flavor is sweet on the palate, offering the chai tea and spices with moderate sugars, apparently from the hot rock caramelization, which pair expertly with all the exotic ingredients packed into the beer. Of all of the daring and bold Dogfish Head beers, this one might be my favorite. Its distant and unfamiliar enough to capture my attention, but sufficiently beer like that Im not repulsed when I drink it.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Aroma of nutmeg, coriander, cardamom, juniper and Belgian yeasts. The appearance is atrocious; a pale amber with a large amount of white particulates and a thin just off white head. Ten minutes after pouring, the particulates have barely started to settle. The taste is sour and bitter but not long lasting. The mouthfeel is acidic  and oily, but the acidity caused enough salivation to counter the oiliness and shorten the taste.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","dfearnley"

The appearance is staggeringly off. Lots of colloidal particles hanging in the beer making it quite unappealing. 

A smooth palate with very good balance. The sweet flavors go great with the belgian yeast and natural sourness of beer. Definitely a beer I'd drink again - hopefully without the weird appearance and possibly on tap!

Ale brewed with Black Chai Tea and Juniper Berries

My Opinion:
A golden/orange, chai tea color is the first thing that will catch your eye as you pour out this delicious and intriguing ale. The next thing that will highten your scences is the delightful aroma that parades out of the bottle ever so gracefully. The cozy smell of chai tea captures the fall season perfectly, leaving you imagining bright colered leaves slowly changing in the cool breeze. The taste... Smooth. A gentle sweetness greets the tongue as the taste of piney juniper berries quickly follow. This ale says its goodbyes with the delicious taste of the chai, leaving a creamy semi-dry mouthfeel that wraps all these intresting flavors togethor into an ale that im sure dogfish head proudly calls Sahtea!

The aroma was of a light bread malt and a sweet doughy yeast with hints of nutmeg, coriander, brown sugar, cinnamon, clove, banana, a bit of citrus and a infusion of tea.

The taste was malty and very sweet with hints of nutmeg, brown sugar and banana early on with the flavor getting a getting a bit spicier with notes of coriander, clove, a mild black tea presence and a nice dose of citrus (lemon I believe) at the end. The flavor lasted only a short while after the swallow with a nice smooth spicy finish.

Big ol chai tea nose not sure if that is a good thing but it is definitely strange there are also aromas of yeast, orange floral tea, soap, juniper, eucalyptus and faint vanilla.

The flavor matches the aroma. Again, weird. Definite chai with a yeasty finish and lingering vanilla tea. A sourness grows as it sits to warm.

I have to say I really enjoy this one as well... itll never be my favorite, but I do like something new and weird every once in a while. I have to admit that Id never heard of Sahti before today, Id definitely be interested in trying some of it in its purest form at some point.

The aroma is out of this world, and absolutely perfect and exactly what I expected when I picked up the bottle! The only 10 Ive ever given for any category.

This is like a wonderful ""Belgian Beer Gingersnap"" if you were to take that cookie and dip it in a sweetened Rooibos tea. Im liking the chai-ness of it, the clove, coriander and cinnamon aroma and taste; the rustic aspect of the sahti is drawing me in as well - I love learning about where beer came from way back.

The clodded cloudiness reminds me that there is real biology going on and I like that a lot! If I saw this on tap and I was in the mood for a nice chill desert - Id choose this over cake or ice-cream any day.

Pretty good.  I liked the spicy heat of the rye, which complemented the sweet and syrupy texture.

Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a smallish bubbly white head that fades to a cap. Smells of pepper, cold tea, nutmeg, and sweet malt, spicy aroma to be sure. Slight phenolic in the nose as well but not to dominating. Taste is a bit sweet with a spicy rye and pepper tone to it. Reminds me a lot of a Saison only with a spicy sweetness. The phenolic is in the taste as well, but subsides a bit as it warms. Taste is a little on the sweet side but I think that plays real well with the spices.

Large slightly off-white head diminishes quickly to very minimal amount of traces of foam atop the beer. 

Beautiful deep golden/dark straw color. Slightly cloudy. A handful of sediment clusters floating around. Nice and slow effervescence. 

Vinous and spice aromas seem most prominent. Chai tea aroma, with scents of black tea and cardamom as well as ginger. Hints of clove, black pepper, and cinnamon (in order of most robust) on nose. Yeasty scents. 

Aroma base like a Bavarian hefe (eg, Franziskaner) though this is a much more complex ale due to the additional ingredients. Also robust aroma of spices covers up any banana like scents.

Taste is as if took a Franziskaner and mixed chai tea concentrate in as well as increasing the abv. Quite deliciously complex.  

All the aromas listed above are noticeable in taste. 

Fruity esters, ginger, and subtle semi-citrusy notes on front palate. 

Bavarian hefe taste mid palate. 

Strong presence of chai tea spices on back of palate and especially on finish.

A minuscule head of white bubbles fade into a thin collar while generous swirls produce nothing spectacular in the way of lace. On the other hand, my generous swirls produce a nose I can smell from my chair, glass not in hand. Sweet and spiced and already tickling my nose, I immediately cup glass in-hand and revel in all her glorious aromatic splendor. Just as promised, black chai abounds, mingling with honeycomb, green bamboo, cucumber, bay leaves, honeydew, and flower petals caressed by a spring breeze. Not all is sweet, as wave after wave of mischievous spices make themselves known: cinnamon sticks, black chair, and freshly picked green chili peppers. Invigorating; I am more than ready to partake of her orange marmalade depths. Instantly mouthcoating, her heavy body coats my lips with exotic honeys kissed with honeydew and clings to the inside of my cheeks. Each quaff lingers with black chai and chili pepper, their spicy heat bleeding into the next quaff, and the next, and so forth. Im not complaining though, not in the least. Her sticky current of honey and marmalade is complimented by slivers of cucumber. In the instance of Sahtea, her nose transfers beautifully to her palate as I revel in all that she has to offer.

Has some of the fruity muddle of my failed HB experiment using re-hydrated fruit in the Mosherian style.  Fizzy head on a dark golden body, very noisy and short-lived.  Tastes a bit like my HB experiement, as well - alcohol is warming but not too harsh, but theres a scratchiness on the throat that is impossible to escape, as well as a light numbing on the sides.  The sucker is bone dry but the alcohol itself, in combination with the esters, lends an initial appearance of sweetness.  Full body with the smack of liqueur.  Faint peach with lots of dust and light grass clippings.  Juniper with very harsh spicing and slick, rollicking vanilla-tinged malt.  Yeah, that about sums it up.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Has plenty of fruit flavor similar to banana, and then has dashes of spice that add coriander on top of the clove, juniper berries, and lemon zest.

Cardomom , ginger, and nutmeg flavors are picked up throughout. Alcohol is not noticed even at 9%.

The taste is very much original: one would think that the tea flavor would not work well with the beer flavor, but it does. The juniper berries also add an herbal ""gin"" note that also mixes well.  Very well balanced, although not something I could have multiples of.   The high alcohol content is hidden well in the spice, honey and malt - almost no bitterness from the hops.

Flavors do have a more pronounced chai character for sure...some solid sweetness, but balanced with the spicey chai character..the body is thick and welcoming, but it doesnt come across as syrupy at all, at least not to me.  I get the Rye character...its not too forward, but its definitely there and it definitely is complimenting with the Chai.  This is certainly not my style, but I really like it regardless...it definitely has a christmas thing to it...it would certainly go with some christmas cookies, or better yet, a spicy cigar.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

Nose is a pronounced belgian yeast aroma followed with hints of juniper and chai tea. Palate is light to medium bodied with a creamy texture. In the taste the traditional chai flavors really shine through, expecially in the finish. A slightly sweet, relaxing summer beer best served chilled. Be careful though, it is a beer for a very specific group of drinkers.

Often DFH beers are interesting, not drinkable, and silly in hindsight.  Why would I want a beer made by professional chewers chewing and spitting authentic Amerindian blue corn?  This one is a bit confusing, but I would have another.  At the start of the pour the tea in the nose is striking but not unpleasant.  The body is a slightly hazy rich orange with a small white heat, which made me think initially of a Belgian tripel but there was no lacing.  Of course ... its rye, not wheat.  The taste is a little surprising as well, its not a triple yeast, but a German yeast.  The spicing in the tea is quite pleasant and the juniper is not overpowering.

The head leaves an utterly ample, beautiful and attractive amount of lacing around the edges of the glass.  The nose is quite fruity and sweet, with notes of berries, yeast, bread, grass, lemon and oranges.  The flavors are a little on the sweet side, but theyre not overpowering.  Usually I dont care for really sweet-tasting beers, but Sahtea doesnt overdo it.  Dogfish has once again found a nice balance between sweet/fruity and overall balance, flavor and drinkability.  The body is extremely smooth and drinkable.  The flavors are really unique, with mostly sweet and fruity notes, but a bit of malty finish.

2572,"2009-12-19",3.1,"(750 ml bottle (2009) from 1828 Vintage House) Pours hazy/cloudy slightly reddish golden. Very slight off-white head effervesces away quickly. Strong, almost sharp aroma of mint, juniper, tea and spice (I think) - interesting but not necessarily appealing, esp. for a beer. Syrupy, smooth, sticky mouthfeel, slightly prickly. Flavor of chai tea - very sweet. Some added elements perhaps of licorice, ginger and other spice. Some sweet caramel maltiness is perhaps the only hint that this is a beer. ABV well-hidden. Its all kind of a bit too much and it fairly quickly fatigues the palate. Alot along the lines of Pangaea and Chateau Jiahu.

Interesting flavor profile, definitely not sahti-like (no noticeable juniper to my taste).

2572,"2009-11-15",3.9,"THOUGHTS: I never had a traditional sahti or chai tea, but this was very good. Very Dogfishy. Very light for the ABV. Hid alcohol incredibly well. It falls into the same general flavor profile of the other DfH historical beers. Basically no hops. Very deceptive. The most deceptive and easy drinking beer next to Mad Elf. One of the better recent DfH beers. It did get a little cloying at the end.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a hazy, dark yellow to light orange with beautiful carbonation and a large, yellowish head that kept a decent sheet and left fair to good lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy, musty, earthy, spicy and fruity yeast, along with spices, tea, fruits, slight mustiness and more and more spices. The initial flavor was sweet and slightly tart; while the finish was sweet and a little more tart with an average duration. There was spices, honey, fruits, flowery juniper, fruit as it warmed, tea, nectar, musty earthiness, caramel, and apricot. It seemed slightly Christmasy, yet lighter. Like a Christmas in July beer. The light to medium body was fairly oily, slightly syrupy and then just a bit dry with rather soft carbonation and a light astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

2572,"2009-11-10",3.4,"750mL bottle. Pours a chunky, hazy golden color with suspended protein aggregates; like an overfed fishbowl; white head with light retention and glistening, fine-bubbled lacing. After the Nogne Dugges Sahti over the weekend, this is a nice return to a beer that actually has a huge juniper presence; the aroma shows lots of juniper, pepper, coriander, and rough-edged sugar notes; by no means a soft presence, this nose is rough and juniper-y and spicy; generous. Lively, chewy presence in the mouth: lots of candy sugar, coriander, and overt sweetness upfront, tempered by plenty of white pepper and a generous helping of juniper and, I think, a hint of that hefeweizen yeast doing its work, causing some bananas and bubble gum esters to show through; quite interesting, slightly rough on the palate (following the nose), just an unabashedly spiced sahti rendition; if theres rye in here, Im not catching it anywhere behind the other stuff.

Initially, a sweet honey and vanilla mixes with spicy peppery rye tang, with some caramel, more gin-esque flavors, grass, grain, and lingering chai spices.  Finishes like honey toast dashed with Indian food spices and a subtle earthy hop presence.  Fairly heavy beer, but Im surprised at how slick and oily the beer ends up feeling, especially with a weizen yeast.  Some creaminess, but not much, and its not from abundant filtering either.

Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a golden wispy off white head. Has a pale rye/bready aroma- a bit sweet with some odd strong plasticy phenols. A touch of alcohol and vanilla wafer as well. The spices are hardly noticeable- perhaps a note of Chai and cardamom as it warms. Thick- slightly syrupy moutheel. Lots of honeyish maltose and a mild diacetyl presence as well with apparent plasticy phenols. Theres such a faint Chai note on the back, with more cardamom than anything, but its too brief and mild to balance out the richness of the caramelized rye. Slightly under-attenuated. Im not sure if a Hefeweizen yeast was the way to go here- it came out way to phenolic which may have hindered the spice qualities. I liked the idea of this beer, but it fell short.

Why not celebrate another centennial rating with another adventurous brew from Dogfish Head?  This one is a fascinating concept, and I read about the brewing of this beer in The New Yorker Magazine, which described how the DH crew were boiling this stuff by dumping red hot rocks into the brew kettle!  Sahtea pours dark gold, and comes at you with an attention-grabbing aroma of floral hops, citrus, yeast, cardomom, and a bit of raw funk too.  The flavor is very interesting - kind of like an extreme wit or a a weird abbey ale.  I noticed malted wheat (altho it may have been rye), lime, and yes, chai-type spices.  A little juniper does come thru also.  Sahtea is complex and flavorful, and the 9% alcohol is well masked.  It is a shame that there seemed to be a touch of sour skank in my bottle, however, the sourness seemed to vanish after I opened it and had it in my refrigerator for a day - very mysterious.  A very interesting brew.  If this is what Finns drank 1200 years ago, then they probably had it pretty good.","USA","Slipstream"

The nose is strong with distinctive aromas of Juniper berries, pepper, and something that I guess is black tea. The flavor strikes me as having a lot of sweet honey with plenty of supporting tea, juniper, allspice and cardamon. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with soft carbonation. The finish is long with lingering sweet honey and some spice. Overall: This is one tasty brew, very nice.

2572,"2009-09-22",3.5,"750ml bottle. Pours a cloudy orange tan/gold with a thin off-white head. The aroma is an interesting mix of toffee and white chocolate with fruit - like white-chocolate-covered raisins. There is also a subtle note of aromatic spices (like nutmeg and coriander). There is a very interesting aroma - hard to describe but almost chocolate like - that I think is from the tea (and maybe ramps leaves?). The flavor follows the aroma: but with a wave sweet maltiness first. Around mid-palate there is a subtle bitterness (from the juniper berries I guess? possibly from alcohol, too) but also a decent bit of soft aromatic spice and fruit. The finish has a really nice, chewy, bready, crackey, toffee malt profile and feels full at first, but actually finishes quite dry with a nice rich maltiness. The mouthfeel is very full with a moderate level of carbonation that is just enough to bring a sparkle of levity to the texture and a subtle tickle on the tip of the tongue. After it goes down, there is a strange drying sensation on the tongue (from the alcohol and/or juiniper berry?). Overall, a very tasty brew but not nearly as complex or interesting as I was expecting. Ultimately, a very drinkable (especially for its strength!), straight-forward, very malty ale.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

2572,"2009-09-03",3.4,"750 ml bottle I courageously brought out from the cellar and decided to drink today from Binnys South Loop (Chicago, IL). Pours a hazy golden orange, glowing, good carbonation with small layer white head that is truly a film, and barely that as it clings to the edges, laces minimally. Aromas are a light spiciness, faint orange peel mixes in with some aromatic black tea, I pick out faint coriander and cardamom (Which can easily be overpowering) with some faint citrus and something lightly reminiscent of chamomile. Spiced well. Initial is light bodied, a bit vague up front, moving into light bitterness, tea, orange peel further in. The spice comes out more towards the finish and sticks better to the palate with chamomile, cardamom, and light coriander taking a position. Juniper is there, lighter than really expected, with faint citrus. A tame beer that almost tastes like a crafts store smells. Light potpourri with a fruitiness that definitely helps the German Weizen yeast come out more. Still, this isnt too bad and is quite interesting overall. Lacking a bit in body, but I thought it was decent enough.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Fuller end of medium body with a nice yeasty/ bread presence with a huge spice character. Lots of coriander, cardamon, pepper, lemon zest, and tea leaves. The berry presence is quite subtle, possibly because of the strong spice element. Orange and lemon peel with ripe banana and nice caramel malt balance.

2572,"2009-09-01",2.0,"Serving: 750 ml bottle.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy, dirty orange with no head at all.  Just light bits of foam.  Certainly not a visual stunner.
Aroma: Bizarre and almost a little offensive.  Oranges, tea, juniper berries, a little mold, and a slight medicinal note.  Certainly not the greatest aroma.
Taste: My first thought was Band-Aids.  Then I got a little citrus fruit, chai, more medicinal notes and a touch of varnish.  Normally this would be an outright drain pour, but it is barely tolerable.
Palate: Medium carbonation with a medium-light mouthfeel.  This one coats the mouth and not in a good way.  Medium, medicinal finish.
Overall: I appreciate what DFH tries to do, really.  But this is just too weird and it just doesnt taste very good.  This one reminds me why I should hold tastings with beers like this.  I cant fathom that anyone would want to drink a whole bottle of this.

2572,"2009-08-22",3.0,"A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass released a pronounced juniper spiciness as well as a two-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The head is a bit fizzy and quickly disappears to a thin ring of a head around the edges of my glass.  The beer is a light amber color that shows a touch of haze and a gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma has lots of juniper character, but underneath this the Chai is quite noticeable with notes of nutmeg, clove and perhaps some woody cardamom.  A sweet, honey-like malt sweetness is found in the finish and in fact helps to carry all the spice notes found in the aroma.  The spice mix, whether juniper of chai derived, definitely dominates the nose of this beer.  If you like the spice mix used you wont find this objectionable and I even find it a bit enjoyable.

Lightly sweet tasting up front, with a viscous heft to it that makes this beer cling a bit to the palate.  The beer picks up more sweetness as it rolls across the tongue and the juniper and spices are surprisingly muted when compared to the aroma.  Up front the Chai spices are a bit more noticeable, will the Juniper is a touch more noticeable in the finish (though the Chai spices are also in the finish).  Up front I get flavors of clove, cinnamon and some spicy cardamom, while the finish has some juniper bite as well as a light turpene driven cardamom spiciness.  Sweet honey-like malt flavors and perhaps a hint of cracker-like malt are all that is noticeable of the base grain character.  Mixed in with the honey notes is a touch of berry character, which could be contributed by the juniper.  The spices in this beer are such that this beer comes off as being somewhat simplistic in its characterization of Chai and juniper.

If you like Chai and juniper, you might enjoy this beer.  While I dont mind either of these flavors, it can be just a bit too much at times.  This is mostly enjoyable, though there is no way I could finish a pint of this, much less a 750ml bottle of it.  Not bad though, and it was certainly worth trying.  Ultimately though it serves as another perfect example of why brewers should learn to show restraint when using spices in a beer (I cant believe I said that after the Theobroma I just had where I decry the opposite approach).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

A soapy wash leaves behind tiny dots that slowly drip back down into the body.  The aroma is fresh and clean, very herbal overall, showing notes of juniper, cardamom, and loads of tea, with a slightly minty overtone and a good amount of lightly caramelized, grainy malt.  Doughy yeast is prominent on the complex nose.  Flavors too are deep and winding, layer after layer of spice unraveling in a very complimentary way.  The black tea and juniper are very prominent, with darker spices like clove and cardamom lending peppery, earthy hints along the way.  Lemon rind adds a bright citrus note, while the sweet wheat grain and sugar glazed bread dough loom in the background.  The palate is medium-plus in body and smooth to the brink of being considered lush, yet simultaneously easy drinking for such a big beer.  I would call this experiment a success.  Its as interesting and well executed as any brew in recent memory.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Itd be perfect except I also get a note of fresh cooked corned-beef that takes away a bit (this could be because my roommate makes fresh real corned beef with juniper berries).

2572,"2009-08-12",3.3,"My Bottom Line:
Honey and rye coagulate into a sticky broth, enlivened by well-integrated chai spiciness for a sweet and quirky Sahti variation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the cloudy gold.
-This is a lot sweeter than the Dugges/Nogne O version.
-The chai takes a lot of room in the flavor profile, but remains well integrated.
-If this had been better attenuated, I would have liked it a lot more.

Poured a suprisingly light,well  compared to the big time Christmasy aroma, golden body with an average size frothy white head. Aroma was well for lack of a better term, Christmasy, to elaborate the juniper berries were shinning through along with some pine resin, and I swear some cinnamon and nutmeg. Fuller bodied that is creamy and slightly foamy with soft bubbly carbonation. The flavor has lots going on with lots of chocolate on the initial flavor, really suprising for the golden shade, juicy orange , herbs, earth notes and spices.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, fizzy/lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

A spice bomb to be sure, but the combo is admittedly quite pleasant (and complex).  I wish the ""beer character"" would shine through the heavy spicing more, but as I say, its far from a one trick pony in that department.  Looks like cloudy soda pop thanks to a brief fizzy head.  But the main thing keeping this from a higher score is that its too unrelentingly syrupy-sweet to drink more than a few ounces of (unless you have a serious sweet tooth I guess). Not a surprise for this brewery in the latter case, as a large number of their products have that fault...Sam must be quite a sugar nut!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2572,"2009-07-13",3.6,"Pours hazy deep gold with 1-finger, fluffy white head.  Nose is hopcitric, chai tea spice, herbs.  Tastes malty, slightly cloying, with hopcitrus and heavy Chai tea spice notes in the flavor.  Also late floral, peppery, and honey notes upon repouring, which gets more turbid.  The repour looks post-Centrum urine yellow, with a flavor a bit like Boddingtons mixed with chai tea might taste.  Unique and interesting, this one is worth a try to show what originality can do within the confines of beer brewing.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2572,"2009-07-12",3.6,"Glad to see Bob and Jason are having all kinds of beer together...douchecanoes. Anyways, this thing pours a bright gold with a thin white head. Looks pretty unassuming. The nose is very pungent, sweet, spicy, aroma is very reminiscent of a pumpkin beer, nutmeg/allspice. Flavor is sweet and spicy, mild alcohol, nutmeg and allspice come through. Nice level of carbonation and hidden alcohol.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
2572,"2009-07-11",3.2,"Bottle generously shared by durhambeer - thanks, Bob! Pleasant golden beer as the base, and the pour demonstrates this pretty nicely. Mild carbonation, and a fairly appealing nose of honey, yeast, ginger, and other spices. You can certainly get the cardamom in the nose, and this really reminds me of one of those organic teas you buy in Whole Foods, specifically the ""Throat Coat"" variety. Sharp and boozy taste, getting a lot of ginger heat (even though not advertised). Treacle, slightly thin body. Another ""interesting"" experiment from DFH, but surely this isnt whats on tap in Valhalla.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2572,"2009-07-10",3.8,"I split this bottle among 4 friends and Let me tell you I was glad. The bottle poured into a Portsmouth snifter produced an extremely short lasting head that faded away to nothing. The color of the brew was hazy golden yellow to brown. 

The first thing that you experience after you crack open the bottle is the aroma of chai it is that predominant. The nose and the flavors make this brew. The chai eventually followed by some other wonderful spices and then juniper as it warms. Flavors on this brew follow the nose to a ""T"" but it is also very complex. Like I said I was glad I split this one It would have been way to much to finish the 750 but I enjoyed every drop of my glass. The mouthfeel is great and there is a light carbonation to this one as well. I will pick up another bottle the next time I see this I was that impressed","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"
2572,"2009-07-10",3.0,"Bottle from Wine Authorities.  Im struggling with this one. Not sure what I expected, but it wasnt this, exactly.  I guess I didnt read the label, because it tastes like all the ingredients... dry Weizen yeast, some lemon/lemongrass, juniper and chai spice weirdness (cardamom and cloves, particularly), and slight tea notes.  Just not really sure why all these things are hanging out together, and Im thinking they should start looking for new friends.  Tastes much better than it smells, and hints at a Belgian golden ale, which almost saves it for me... but doesnt quite.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
2572,"2009-07-10",3.8,"Bottle slit with Ryguy and Fannon. Pours a bright orange with haze, and a small white head. The aroma is slight malt, honey and alcohol. The taste is tea, honey, malt, lemon, coriander, and spice.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2572,"2009-07-09",3.9,"Reviewed on 6/22/2009...so...Chai tea and juniper berries, huh? Only other Sahti Ive tried was from Nogne Ø so dont confuse me with any maven of the style...the Duvel tulip seems like itll work just fine for this one. Mild ""pffft"" of the cap.

Pours a very cloudy, farmhouse-ish flat and ultra viscous honey gold with a fair amount of lemon pith. Relatively translucent - active yet sparse carbonation is visible from the bottom up. One downer is really no head to speak of - just a couple of yeast wisps. This is really almost gelatinous, its so thick.

Well, I can definitely make out the juniper and a little honey with a lot of deep sweetness. Can make out the spicing of the Chai tea very nicely. Not sure of the style guidelines but this smells pretty damn good to me. Just a little bit of mild yeast electricity here.

As comforting and viscous as it looks and smells, it rolls down the gullet the same way. There are all of the nice elements of juniper, Chai, clove and a light note of honey sweetness. A bit of dryness from the yeast clearing everything out keeps everything pretty clean, even with the gravity of it all. Quite good. Its not the shock to the system that the new(er) world Nogne Ø offering was - this seems more subtle and mellow.

I really enjoy the palate feel of this one. It has a heavy quotient at first but the yeast and spiciness really dry it up well for the weight class while also keeping it very clean and refreshing on the finish. Almost spritely from the juniper (which is not overstated...its own blessing) and the mild Chai tea spicing. Very even-keeled and excellent.

First Sammy C. digs out the Old Odense Ale in a collaboration with NB. Now this. Nothing like playing old B-sides people havent heard in a while...or ever! This is a fine offering that drinks quite well - maybe the heft and viscosity make it at least somewhat of a sipper, but its enjoyable all the way through. Nice job.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"
2572,"2009-07-08",3.9,"Pours with very little head. Wheat-beer appearance.  Very fruity/spicy nose-  lots of grapefruit.   Exceptionally smooth taste for 9%.  Finish is indicative of nose.  Another fine example of the ingenuity of this brewery.",", Virginia, USA","zepfoowez"
2572,"2009-07-07",4.0,"Location: A big bottle from Gillys, 7/7/09


Aroma: Sweet and spicy aroma, cinnamon is very strong, the obvious tea and berries, perhaps a little vanilla, spice is strong in the nose, really unusual but enjoyable nose on this one...

Appearance: A lightly hazy light orange color, with minimal head and no lacing

Flavor: The tea really comes through in the flavor, malty and enjoyable, also lots of spice (just like the nose), some earthiness in there as well.

Palate: Really smooth and easy drinking.  Is this is really 9%?  No alcohol burn at all...Wow.  Nice mouthfeel and body as well.

Overall Impression: 
I find it ironic to call this a traditional ale, because it is anything but traditional... Anyway, you know how the Dogfish guys love to push the envelope and this is no different.  Great job of experimenting, this one paid off, and  I really enjoyed it.
