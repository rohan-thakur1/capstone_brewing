491,"2015-04-18",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2015 Live from NH. Growler (1L) from Tony, thanks! Split 3-ways with Julien and Chris. 

Appearance: Dark brown with a small ring of beige foam and little llacing. 

Aroma: Enticing crème brûlée aroma with caramel, coffee notes, light vegetal notes and light milky notes.

Taste: Light roasted acidity, low to moderate sweetness level, crème brûlée, vegetal coffee notes, milky presence and light bitterness.

Palate: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Fluffy-chewy mouthfeel. 

Overall: Wonderful crème brûlée aroma. The taste doesnt quite lives up to the aroma, but its still a really tasty stout.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

491,"2014-04-28",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2016 On tap, poured into a shaker. Very pleasant, sweet, strong aromas of sweet coffee, chocolate brownies, warm, thick teeth-hurting caramel, and vanilla are immediately noticeable. Its a dark, nearly-opaque cola brown with a very thin, runny, coffee-brown head. A large bubble, thin ring remains, with a light, wispy lace. Perhaps Im under-rating the sweetness in this one simply because of how sweet it smelled, but Id say medium bitter, medium sweet taste. The bitter definitely seems to stand out a bit more on the taste based on the aroma. Its a full, rich malty body, with a noticeable viscous texture (at first, I thought for sure it was an imperial stout based on its texture); not much help from the nearly flat carbonation too. Rich, meaty, sweet coffee ground finish with a rich caramel and vanilla, combined with a roasted grain aftertaste that has a moderate lifespan to it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Taste: A lot of dark coffee and chocolate, but its not very bitter... super tasty, and very drinkable. Really, it drinks a lot like a cold coffee. Feels smooth and only makes the beer even better.

This one is a bit syrupy sweet and its not so much a beer as a confectionery delight. Its caramel sweetness, with toffee, doused with liberal amounts of vanilla and coffee and its so good.

My pour is pitch black with a smooth, quickly fading coffee brown head. 

The aroma is dark, medium roasted malt, tons of creamy coffee, and vanilla.

The flavor starts out with some milk sweetness, a good amount of roasted malt, lots of slightly bitter and very full-flavored coffee. There is some lingering bitterness, but the vanilla and cream really come to dominate the flavor. Fairly sweet.

Crème Brûlée has a medium to full body, light carbonation. Slight milk stickiness. Very creamy and smooth.

Pours a moderate brown color with quite a bit of haze. Single-finger off-white head with a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose is quite nice with a lot of cream and vanilla plus a good deal of coffee. Some roasted malt lingering in the background. The flavor is a bit too cloying as the vanilla and cream start to take over a bit. Still, nice flavors lingering in the background and I like the addition of the coffee, which makes this much, much more drinkable than Southern Tiers Creme Brulee. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy and the sweetness works here. I like this version better than the Imperial.

491,"2010-04-26",4.2,"Awesome beer and have been looking forward to trying Kuhnhenn brews for quite a while now.

A- Body is a thick viscous black/dark brown hue. Seems like its going to pour completely flat at first but then at the last second a 1/2-1 finger dark brown foamy head emerges and stays for a few seconds before it fades to a very thin collar. No lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Just as the name suggests. A big vanilla scent comes forward first along with sweet cream and roasted dark malt/coffee notes. Smell is more sweet than bitter but does add a very nice roasted coffee accent.

T- Much like the smell. This is much more of a sweet stout than a bitter stout and follows the milk stout style profile very well. Upfront is sweet vanilla and cream with a big roasted malt java backbone. The roasted malt flavor comes through a bit more for the finish as well as the initial flavors intensifying.

P- Low to medium carbonation and a very nice, rich, smooth and creamy milky body.

O-This is a great beer overall and definitely Trumps Southern Tiers offering. Wonderful, sweet, rich, and creamy. It almost becomes cloying after 1/2 a growler but it takes much much longer than STs offering to reach this point (about 3 oz). great beer overall and I am looking forward to trying more from this brewery.

491,"2009-04-19",4.1,"Thanks go out to goryshkewych for the growler. I shared this with a few friends so it was in a standard pint glass a rough pour produced a two finger tan head that went to a light lace. There was a black body on the brew with brown highlights. 

Aromas were coffee and sweetness, someone said it reminded them of a French vanilla coffee and Id have to agree. Even so much in the flavor profile as well this I would have to classify as my first desert beer. This brew is a sipper with a medium feel to the mouth with light carbonation. The roastiness of the malts helped the sweetness a lot by keeping it in check. The only negative in the taste was an imitation vanilla flavor that kept popping up in my mind.

A great desert beer if I lived in the area I would defiantly use this brew to close out a great dinner with friends. This brew is very unique; I would recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind a little sweetness in their brews.","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

Sudsy snake-like lines of lacing cling to the glass for dear life, eventually succumbing to gravity.  Wow, what a fantastic nose on this beer!  Seriously, this smells like a mocha milkshake with a vanilla whipped cream topping.  It smells so good, you almost dont want to drink it for fear that the flavor wont live up to the nose.  Alas, your fears are confirmed, as the flavor turns more pedestrian, but still very good.  Drier, with more of a chocolaty roast character, I was expecting a bit more sweetness on the palate.  Dont get me wrong, this still tastes like a formidable stout, but theres no way it could possibly live up to that world-class aroma.  The mouthfeel is similar to an Irish stout, which is to say medium bodied with a relatively dry finish.  Chocolate roast and vanilla linger on the tongue.

491,"2007-01-10",3.6,"On tap at the brewery.  From tasting notes made at the brewery on 8/22/06.  Pours a dark charcoal black color with a creamy layer of tan head.  Aromas of roasted malt mingle with some cocoa powder, caramel, and milky vanilla.  Medium bodied, sweet mouthfeel.  The vanilla and caramel tones seem to be a bit artificial in the sense that it tastes like its been added to the beer and not a natural creation from the brewing process.  Nonetheless, it tastes good and makes an interesting after-dinner brew.  Finish is a touch watery and contains some nice, dry coffee characters.Additional Notes:  At the time I had this beer on draft, I purchased a 12oz bottle to go.  My intention was to spend some time with the bottled version and combine my tasting notes from the brewpub to make a thorough rate.  Unfortunately, my bottle was infected, so Ive chosen to add my rating based on my draft experience only.  My bottle was a major gusher and total sour bomb, and it looks like most of the other rates from this bottled batch indicate the same problem (Bottled March 2006).

Sean and I both said (Best aroma ever about the same time..)Then I had to spoil the effect by drinking it. Sour, lactic and thin.

Dancing bubbles for the head and a fizzy looking body.  Aroma draws out caramel cappuccino, tiramisu, coffee grinds, brown sugar, blackened oats and dark chocolate.  Flavor leads me to believe that Kuhnhenn might have been a little bit generous with their ""best by"" date.  Medium-bodied, slick and searing from potentially oxidized qualities.

Ive had this beer twice, once from the tap and once from a leaky growler.  The opened growler version was sour as all hell and horrible.  I can only assume that those of you who panned this beer had unsealed samples that oxidized or something.  Fresh this was awesome; it lived up to the smell you all rave about.  Thick creamy tan to light brown head over opaque black.  Medium thickness lacing is sticky, eventually crumbling lke a bunch of ice floes.  Caramel mocha smell with chocolate liquour, like Kalhua, all dopeness in the wafting esters.  Sweet and medium-full mocha up front, dry coffee ground and bakers chocolate finish.  Great transition between the dessert sweetness and the dry, powdery finish.  Silky smooth texture, not as full as other stouts but I wouldnt say watery either.  Where do I complain about this beer?  I cant.  If only I could be confident in the bottles, I would seek this out in trades.  As it is, I might just wait until Kuhnhenn starts distributing kegs.

Aroma has a good medley of roasted mocha milked coffee with chocolate additions to its roast. A tender amount of dark cherry and purple grapes steep underneath.

Smoothes off the back end with very light smoothness of chocolate cake and cookie dough. Stays pretty sour and sad for most of its duration. Im wondering if this may be an infected bottle?

Feel is slippery and smooth with a lighter medium body and some empty areas. Not all that active or playful. Just kinda there. Sourness is getting in the way of most of what the feel potentially could be?

Almost opaque with no head--dark, reddish brown at thinner parts of the glass.  This beer looked like a glass of coca-cola.  The aroma was of creme brulee and a bit fruity but really lacked character.  Flavour was very dry and subdued and a bit soda watery with a burnt malt finish.  There was a pleasant coffee flavour that developped somewhere near the end of the taste.  Thin body and medium carbonation.  The coffee and malt bitterness lingered.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

491,"2005-06-02",3.8,"Bottle at Mondial 2005.  Very sweet, chocolatey aroma with mild vanilla hints.  Extremely tempting aroma that is not too off from Dieu du CIels Aphrodisaque.  Mildly transparent dark brown/mahogany color with a small tan head.  Start is somewhat acidic and harsh, but turns chocolatey and sweet in the middle with hints of vanilla.  Moderate roastiness to finish.  The acidity and lack of body really detracts from this beers marvellous aroma.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
491,"2005-05-25",3.0,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2006 Rerate 8/8/06: I got this bottle out of the cooler at Kuhnhenn, so I can attest to its handling.  Pour fills the glass with about 80% foam.  After it all settles, the aroma is full of tart fruity notes with some mild roastiness.  Body starts lightly sweet and caramely malty, quickly turning sour toward a dry, woody, ashy, and smoky tart finish with lingering mocha notes.  Somethings definitely infected here, and this is the second time Ive noticed it.  Maybe, the error lies in the way they (hopefully) sterilize the coffee that gets added, because Ive never noticed infections in any of their other beers.

Original rating 5/25/05: Dark and opaque with a thin, tan head with marginal lacing.  Has a nice roasty coffee aroma reminiscent of Founders Breakfast Stout with some sweet caramel and chocolate malts, and a touch of light fruity tartness.  Starts lightly malty and sweet but unveils some sour, acidic character that I find out of place.  Finshes semi-dry, lightly tart and the roasty coffee shows up again amidst dark chocolate.  Get rid of the acidity and add a touch more malt and you got a great beer.  Thanks to jtw for the bottle!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
491,"2005-05-16",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2006 Not the nitro version. I was drinking with pintbypint and he had accidentally ordered the nitro version. The body is black with amber highlights and traces of a head on top. The aroma is strong coffee sweetened with brandy and maple syrup. The taste is light coffee with grass and dark chocolate. As you drink, you also get molasses hints. Had this again at a festival. Still a solid beer.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
491,"2005-05-15",3.7,"On tap, nitro. Poured near black, red highlights. One inch of sticky dark tan foam. Nice lacing. Light mouthfeel. Creamy chocolate notes in the flavour, also faint vanilla. Aftertaste of bitter chocolate.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","pintbypint"
491,"2005-05-08",3.7,"Bottle from Walleye: Pours nearly opaque with crimson highlights and a fading frothy head which leaves a ring and good lace. The aroma is pure chocolate and vanilla latte with a hint of berry and earthy esters. The taste is less refined with the expected coffee, mocha, and vanilla bean notes but also displayed some interesting sour fruit and charred wood notes. A finish of some lingering bitters and grainy notes. The feel is a letdown, fizzy and thinner than I would have guessed. Different from most Java Stouts as the vanilla bean and mocha character is more dominate and then there is that lactic/fruity sourness than keeps you wondering. A darn solid brew but something I can say is probably not for everyone.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
491,"2005-04-27",3.1,"Smells great! Looks great! Tastes like... a lager and a bitter cup of coffee simply poured together. Not too appetizing, this one. I feel like theyre trying to cover up the unbalance of flavors by adding very sweet, almost fruity flavors.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","tjwais"
491,"2005-04-21",3.7,"Pours a deep black color with a very small brown highlight and a thin light brown head. Wow, amazing aroma of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate, maybe vanilla too. The flavor is very different, its much more lactic with coffee, chocolate and roasted malt notes. Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. This beer feels a bit like a let down since the aroma is so excellent and the flavor while being good is less amazing, still this is an enjoyable stout. Merci Stephen !","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
491,"2005-04-18",3.5,"Bottle: Coffee brown, nearly black, foamy beige head, thin, smeared lacing.   Freshly ground coffee bean dominates.   Subtle roasted malts.   Lactic up front, slightly sour immediately after.   Trailing lambic like sourness.   Light bodied Stout, mouthfeel much the same.   Confused finish, heavily roasted malt based lambic, or baby gueuze.   Great nose, but didnt follow through.   Quite interesting otherwise.   Thanks John!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
491,"2005-04-10",3.3,"Black with maple hues. Thick beige ring of foam retains well. Spent coffee beans aroma with chalky accents. Phenolic, toffee pudding, and lactose whispers. Notably airy and fuzzy. Light bodied. Heavy acidity stymies the fullness with a frontal assault of yogurt and soured plums. Smoky phenols lurk  in the background. Lengthy java finish shows hints of cinnamon, roasty malt, and more custard flavors as the body possesses just enough softness to curtail the acridness. The full-blown acidity is puzzling, especially with this being a relatively young bottle. Otherwise, behind the overt coffee presence in the aroma, theres a good degree a brightness. A noble effort.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
491,"2005-04-01",3.6,"Strong cocoa and roasted malt, coffee-like aroma.  Opaque brown-black with decent but short-lived, off-white head that recedes rapidly to ring.  Chocolate, pit fruit and roasted malts with a mild cabbagey note in the flavour that is not wholly unappealing.  Medium body with moderate carbonation that feels a bit strong.  Tulip glass, just above fridge temp.  Enjoyed with ClarkVV, MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
491,"2005-03-31",4.0,"New England Road Trip Easter 05 with MartinT, tiggmtl and Rastacouere, beer #36. Sampled in our motel room, joined by the locquacious and sagacious ClarkVV.  12 oz bottle.  Solid black, tiny head falls into a miniscule ring...absolutely jawdropping chocolate-latte aroma, burnt caramel rustling with bourbon vanilla and the tiniest hint of black cherry...sweetened Turkish coffee in the body, bit of wine...somewhat thin and too-carbonated late, so it doesnt quite ascend the mountain, but damn if I cant still smell it.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
491,"2005-03-29",3.7,"Thanks again Clark! This Kuhnhenn stout sure does resemble the acclaimed Founders Breakfast stout. It is very dark brown and proposes a nice off-white ring. Its aroma is an overwhelming espresso medley, not even beany, this wins big points considering the vanilla undertones. I rarely encounter them without this usually unpleasant beany aspect. Strong chocolate complexities make this a total dessert brew. Strongly carbonated body, medium in size. It has pleasant sweet and tart vanilla essence notes that match the chocolate in an overall sweet flavour profile that doesnt quite match the aroma, but this remains a surprisingly good stout.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

491,"2005-03-25",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2006 draft and bottled versions are nearly identical.  intense coffee aroma, but augmented by a strong sweet caramel aroma--an interesting contrast.  quite silky smooth, essentially no element of alcohol.  unfortunately, later batches of this have been plagued by infections.  ive decided to average the scores based on the decent taste of fresh stuff and the acidic artificial taste of the bad stuff since i probably had more samples of bad bottles.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
491,"2005-03-20",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2006 Draft at Kuhnhenn. Pours an oily black color with basically no head. Nose is sweet sugary malt with tons of fresh ground coffee. Taste is vanilla ice cream dunked in a latte. Very sweet but not overly powering, there is still lots of coffee and lots of roasty flavors. Vanilla seaps through the edges to give a tinge and it finishes with a filmy palate.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
491,"2005-03-16",3.6,"This stuff is more like a shot of beer in a mug of coffee rather than the other way around.  But damn it works.  Plenty of java in the aroma.  Nice deserty flavors of chocolate and roasted malts.  
This stuff is the best breakfast beer in Motown.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
491,"2005-03-15",3.8,"Pitch black, tan creamy head.  The aroma was awesome if you dig desert.  Loads of vanilla crème brule, cold espresso grounds, and a nice hint of milk chocolate.  Tasted like liquid vanilla custard, coffee, and chocolate. A light hop bitterness at the end kept it only steps away from hitting the cloying line.  Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, caramelized vanilla custard like finish.  Good stuff, but you probably dont want to make this your session stout....","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
491,"2005-02-23",3.8,"On nitro at the release party.  Dark brown, almost black with a foamy tan head and great lacing.  Lots of carmel and coffee in the aroma.  Coffee, chocolate, and hints of carmel in the taste.  A bit thinner than I would have expected, but that makes it a bit easier to drink. Overall, a very tasty, easy to drink brew.","Rowlett, Texas, USA","flemdawg"
491,"2005-02-21",3.3,"First, let me say that I had HUGE expectations for this beer.  Im a big fan of Kuhnhenn brews 99% of the time, HOWEVER - This one just didnt do it for me.  The stout was almost black with a darker tan head.  The aroma was reminiscent of flavored caramel coffee to me.  The tast however, was nothing like the strong ""in your face"" nose.  The beer struck me as sweet at first, then watery and thin - followed by bitter coffee.  I was a bit disappointed, but hey - beer can be fickle...","USA","HiABV4Me"

The flavor reminds me of a dark chocolate and coffee truffle,","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
491,"2005-02-20",3.2,"Nitro tap.  Deep black in color with a creamy light brown head. Excellent lacing.  Big coffee aroma pretty much dominates the nose, not a lot of malt sneaks out.  Sweet and sugary flavors, having never had Creme Brule I am going to guess that this is what it tastes like.  A bit sour towards the end.  Body is watery which is disappointing.","Alabama, USA","11026"

491,"2004-08-16",3.4,"2004 Great Taste of the Midwest. Dark brown body, no real head. Very big and sweet aroma that reminds me of coffee filled with irish creme... consists mostly of sugary coffee and vanilla. Dry watery taste with some vanilla and slight vinous notes, and of course some sweet coffee. A very light, but interesting stout.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"

491,"2004-07-29",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2006 2004 draught at MI summer beer fest.  Pours a dark beige/hazelnut brown with some darker black waves in it.  Small light brown head and plenty of rich oily coffee aroma.  Aroma gets in your face, like a cold cup of coffee poured from the end of the pot.  Very roasty, oily and nutty.  Flavor is much the same.  It tastes like an iced latte with a couple shots of espresso and a hint of vanilla syrup.  The flavor is wonderful, but the body is very loose and gets a tad watery on the finish.  There is some sweetness towards the finish, but it tastes lightly syrupy (but not cloying).  Strange beer here, but it is a great drink for breakfast.  Body is medium, low carbonation, slightly watery.2005 bottle  Wow, dont remember the aroma being this intense.  Extreme cappucino/mocha notes invade the nose.  Head is well-retained and the body is heavily sedimented (unfiltered).  The body could use a good deal more maltiness, and there are some dry, almost cardboardy notes, that get in the way of enjoying this as much as I would like to.  Brown sugar, honey and coffee beans round out the finish.  Medium body could be a bit fuller.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
