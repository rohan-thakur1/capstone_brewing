240,"2017-06-21",3.7,"Can from Brewtopia. Pale clear gold with lasting head and lace. Grassy noble hops aroma with a touch of lemon. Bready crackery medium sweet malts with a touch of peach and apricot. Light grassy long bitterness with a little spice. Light body, a little sticky for style, soft carbo. Pretty good. I like kolsches to be a little lighter and drier. .................................................. [Fuck A-B/Inbev]","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
240,"2017-06-17",3.4,"On tap. Pours a golden color with a white head that faded quickly. Aroma of citrus, bit of malt sweetness and grass. Taste of citrus, light fruit and bit of malt sweetness. Decent bitterness and a clean finish. Fairly light body, crisp clean and refreshing. Easy drinker on a Summer day.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
240,"2017-06-02",3.2,"DATE: June 2, 2017... OCCASION: a quiet night after a long short week (back from NOLA), and in need of something soft and pillowy... GLASSWARE: Ayinger willibecker.... pours a crisp, crackling golden body that cascades upward to craft a white webbing of head that holds serious clout... two fingers descends in time, but leaves a resilient reminder that the beer is fresh and ready... lemon grass and yeast strains mingle with banana and light biscuit to suggest a pilsner, thought the hops are not assertive at all in that way.. first sip rolls straight to the throat, refreshing with a bit of lingering texture...light bodied, suitable for slamming, but fizzy and creamy enough to be acknowledged...the flavor is lemon grass, hay, a bitterness that holds sway and the maltiness of something stronger... oats, cereal, or some other grain makes for the weightier flavor... at 4.8%, a nonthreatening drink to mow down before or after yard work... could be a bit crisper or cleaner, but the style begs for a bit of simplicity...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
240,"2017-06-01",3.3,"Tallahassee. Fl - New Leaf Market - 12 oz can. Sparkling, medium gold pour, soft, snow white head, decent film of lacing. Aroma has some light buttery accents, light graininess. Pleasant flavor, some buttery notes, light spiciness, some grassiness. Mouthfeel has a decent crispness to it. Nice summer refresher.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
240,"2017-06-01",3.1,"Rated on 6-01-2017. The appearance of this canned beer is a medium sized pure white fizzy, semi-frothy head that mostly diminished, medium yellow transparent body, lively, fast rising carbonation observed, and one ring of lacing. The aroma presents light citrus hops, lightly fruity, earthy, toasty, grainy, and pale malt. The flavor is bready, lightly fruity, lightly sweet, pale malt, and a semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel is light carbonation, smooth and thin. This beer is light bodied. This is an easy drinking Kolsch beer as there is not a lot going on with its taste. There is more character to the aroma than the taste. It is a bit refreshing on a warm June day. It is a beer that did not lead me to buying again as I have had much better tasting Kolsch beers.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
240,"2017-05-31",2.6,"Creamed corn nose. Clear yellow, medium head, good lace. Barley and hay, lemongrass on the back end. Corn husks. Light body, moderate carbonation. Seems more like a cream ale.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
240,"2017-05-27",4.4,"appearance: clear gold, with a finger of creamy white head that lingers, leaving good lacing.  aroma: bright lemon, cracked pepper, grainy and crackery malts, hint of grass.  taste: 	grainy malts up front, slightly sweet, with crackery toast under that; theres some lemon zest, then some floral and grassy hops.  finish:  light hop dryness, slight bitterness, lingering grassy and floral notes, and just a bit of crackery sweetness; zippy, light palate with a nice level of carb. notes: 	Kölsch is probably my favorite style of beer in the lighter beer family. Im always seeking the next good one, and it seems like a very easy style to screw up, because Ive had a lot of bad ones, and very few that are good. This one is probably the top in the style that Ive ever had. More flavor than most, but the flavors are true to the style, and the palate is absolutely perfect.  Can from Village Beer and Wine in Rockville.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"
240,"2017-05-26",3.0,"12 oz single can from Bottles & Bitters at Sloans Lake. Clear golden appearance with a white head. Aroma of bread, toasted grain and light hops. Similar flavor, adding mild malt sweetness and a light hop bitterness. Light and crisp, a decent Kölsch overall. ""Its the only way to fly!""","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"

240,"2017-05-19",3.7,"12 ounce can. Hazy straw yellow, large foamy tan head, good retention. Aroma of toasted malt, grainy malt, a bit of a floral hop note. The taste is lemon, pale bready malt. Citrus. Medium bodied, juicy.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
240,"2017-05-19",3.6,"Here is our first Kolsch rating and a fine hot weather beer it be. The aroma is a faint oaty / wheaty yeast lagery vibe and the pour is a nondescriptive yellow slightly dehydrated urine looking thing. The taste is crisp, bright, and refreshing, some very light citrus and a heavy dose of liquid gluten top it off. It goes down smooth and is great for chowing down on a hot day. Good for listening to Hunger Strike by Temple of the Dog on repeat and waiting for the air conditioning to spread.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"
240,"2017-05-12",3.5,"12 oz. can. BBD 08/19/2017. Pours a medium, well retained white head, with slight lacing, over a clear effervescent, yellow (SRM 3) body.......nose is light malts, with hints of bread, wheat, mild hop spice, balanced, no esters......taste is moderate malts with hints of light colored fruits (pear, apple), well attenuated, mild hop spice finishing with very light bitterness, nicely balanced......mouth feel, light body, no alcohol, high carbonation. This is a very clean, well attenuated, nicely balanced beer which meets the light style nicely. BJCP 8/3/14/4/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"
240,"2017-05-12",3.3,"Can - slightly cloudy yellow gold with one finger white head.
crisp and herbal aroma undercut with a touch of sweet grain. Light bodied with a flavor like the aroma. Slightly dry and crisp refreshing finish. Well done for the style and price.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
240,"2017-05-11",3.2,"On draft at Global Brew Edw. Clear golden with white foam. An American version to be sure. Melon bitterness along with citrus. Malts are moderately tasted along with a little corn. Some earth and very gentle spice. This is uncomplicated and pleasant.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
240,"2017-05-09",3.7,"Pint at The Hornet. Looks pretty clear gold with a small head. Thats always a good sign. Light, but malty nose on this. I dont detect any esters. Notes of cornbread, a touch of earthy hops, cereal, and mineral water. The mouthfeel is crisp with a dry finish. Light is a great description for this one. Nothing lingers in the flavor. Pilsner malt character starts to shine halfway through the pint, but again nothing sticks to my palate. Hoppiness is quite low. Really clean and crisp.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
240,"2017-04-24",3.7,"Aroma is fruit, malts/pale malts and earthy. The flavor is malts/pale malts, mild fruit and a mix of tart and very slightly tangy/bready sweet in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"

240,"2017-04-23",3.3,"Blind tasted with 3 other ""blonde"" ales. Beers included: 1. Solemn Oath LU, 2. Left Hand Travelin Light, 3. Green Flash Blonde (GFB). Rater 1 rated the beers 132, Rater 2 (ME): 23 TIE 1, Rater 3: 312, Rater 4: 23 TIE 1.


355ml can. Golden pour. Clean citrus aroa, hint of banana. Flavor is clean, bit sweetish, creamy drinkable.


Post tasting thoughts:

This tied for the lead in a not-so-spectacular crop of blondes. It is very brewpubby, but in that context one of the better koelsches. It certainly isnt as traditional as some.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
240,"2017-04-22",3.4,"Crisp refreshing kolsch with good flavor. Slight lagerish funk but not that much. More body than some kolsch. Nice overall.","East Greenbush, New York, USA","Mep3222"

240,"2017-04-01",4.0,"Can. Bready malt aroma with notes of citrus and floral hops with some doughy character. Pours clear pale golden colored with half a finger of white head that has good retention but little lacing. Starts with good bready malt and some grassy hoppiness. Finishes smooth, dry and refreshing with light citrus and hop notes that are just enough to balance the malt. Very nice kolsch.","","zoucrew102"
