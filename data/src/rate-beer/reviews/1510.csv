1510,"2017-05-29",3.0,"Had a can at home, once again find myself sharing with my husband. I don't mind sharing this one though, it certainly does not taste like an IPA like the description says (or at least not a good one). It's one of the better wheat beers I've had, tastes like citrus on a fortunate island of misfit toys. Overall I like it but wouldn't get it again which is more because I don't love wheat beer than anything else.

1510,"2017-05-29",3.8,"1 pint can: Appearance is an almost clear golden hue, topped with a big head of very transient white froth, which once receded, cannot be restored through swirling. Aromas are strongest when the froth is receding, dominated by hoppy citrus and floral notes, but the underlying earthy notes of the wheat maltiness are still present. Taste follows the aromas, fruity sweetness, mixed with bitterness, especially in the finish, all over a relatively strong malty backbone. The carbonation is average, although the brew feels somewhat light bodied, it is nevertheless a tasty brew! Interestingly well executed variant of a wheat beer without making it into a full blown pale ale or IPA!","","the_beergery"

1510,"2016-09-27",4.1,"De la micro cervecera Modern Times(USA) esta American Wheat Ale Fortunate Islands"" con 5% ABV y 46 IBUs, el estilo es la reinterpretación americana de las cervezas de trigo europeas, la intensidad y variabilidad de los lúpulos es generosa según el standard, en la lata de esta cerveza nos vienen bien detallados los lúpulos usados Citra y Amarillo, tambien las maltas, gravedad final e inicial, Ratebeer tiene en muy buena estima esta receta de San Diego, California pues la califica con 100 en estilo y 96 en el general, por lo general tiene muy buena calidad esta cervecera y es muy reconocida en la actual capital de la cerveza artesanal.
http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/modern-ti 

En apariencia es una cerveza de corona de espuma ligeramente mediana de igual retención, perlas blanquecinas de tamaño compacto, color del liquido amarillo con toques dorados, cuerpo ligero pero no acuoso, carbonatación media.
El aroma es frutal, inicialmente frutos de carozo como durazno y mango, piña, ligeramente menos cítrica como toronja o cascara de naranja, es decir el lúpulo impera, la malta queda en segundo plano, dando notas meramente a trigo con una pequeña acidez perceptible característica de esta misma malta, la intensidad general es buena y desde que se destapa llega de inmediato en nariz.
Su sabor muy balanceado hacia destacar el lúpulo, se abre primero una buena dosis de amargor con alusiones a mango, piña, toronja, naranja, poco dulzor lo que hace que se pronuncie mas seca, la malta da ligero sabor a pan, al final acidez que acompaña la mayoría de las veces a el trigo pero nada grave, en general es intensa y aunque no hay tantos IBUs casi no contiene dulzor, esto la hace mas seca y con el amargor mas pronunciado de lo que uno podría esperar, el retrogusto es consistente a toronja, muy rica e ideal para el calor, cumple muy bien con el estilo y le saca bastante provecho a los lúpulos como buena receta de estilo americana.","MEXICO","Yased"

Piana słabiutka, niska, drobnoziarnista.
Bardzo szybko znika z powierzchni. Niemniej jednak centymetrowy krążek nie tonie w piwie.
W aromacie świeżość cytrusów. Przede wszystkim miąższ z żółtych grejpfrutów, cytryny, limonki i pomelo, a na drugim planie agrest.
Aromat dosłownie miażdży swoją intensywnością. Jest do bólu wytrawny i zdecydowanie w stylu West Coast.
Charakter słodowy schowany w oddali.
Chmiele dają posmak grejpfrutów, ananasów i limonek.
Pszeniczne niuanse subtelnie podkreślone, ale nie mają szans z dominacją chmielu.
Na języku pojawia się lekka trawiastość, a pod koniec dugastii nawet trochę pikantności.

1510,"2015-08-20",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2016 March 12th, 2014 - Modern Times is a hop forward brewery, at least according to my limited exposure, and part of that vanguard is the Fortunate Islands. Well matched to March, it is a sloppy, frothy, sloshy looking beer, with a thick mattress of a head, and underneath it, a hive of bubbles and carbonation. The aroma is powerfully hoppy and dry, like a dry lemon, and a touch of high-end paper, adding a nice fibrous scent. The flavor is much sweeter, but still retrains much of the noses dry lemon taste, wrapping it with a sprig of lemon verbena. The carbonation is is an excellent pairing with the flavor, and near the end of the taste the two give rise to some dandelion green bitterness and palate activity. This is a lovely, lovely beer and goes a long way towards bring me closer to Modern Times cult of personality.

October 25th, 2013 - Fortunate Islands has a lovely name, and a the flavor is oddly nautical, keeping with the title. The smell is, well, curious. Ever tried steamed crab with Old Bay seasoning? I find some of that in the nose, and I love it. Its savory but brings the crab sweetness too, all bundled into the beer in a way that hits at the scent without making this a weird seafood brew. The flavor is more traditional, resinous and hoppy, almost standard in its approach. The hops profile is clear, but thick and sweet, and losing some of that fascinating oceanic smell. 8/3/6/3/14","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

-A veil of foam covers the translucent golden.
-The mouthfeel is almost pils-like; this is crushable, to say the least.
-Bitterness is herbal and also moderate.
-The hop fruitiness gets fruitier and fruitier.
-This is not a complex brew, but it is highly engaging.

My first taste of this light, honey-hued beverage is filled with flavor; dank hops and super ripe mangoes are flooding my mouth, filling it with sweet summery goodness and making me want a swim in the river on a hundred degree day. Theres a backdrop of raw almonds in the flavor that announces itself as the beer warms. This is delightful in flavor and although I have never been a huge fan of wheat beers, this one has captured my heart...um...palate.
The foam atop starts out snow-white, porous and soft; thick as a snowdrift and fading to almost nothing in a few minutes. The finish is lightly bitter, with an almost insignificant dryness that creates a need for more of this light-bodied brew.

Not too bitter, they must have hopburst this baby with high quality hops. As the beer warms up, the tropical fruit really starts shining. Tangerine and mango with a bit of pineapple.

The aroma offers up soft wheat and then floral and earthy hops just ahead of a thin ribbon of grassiness. The taste is a hop heavy mix of wheated malts, pine hops, some wheat smoothness and then a faint banana note. It gets a bit juicy with grapefruit hops here and there. Not sure this comes across as a wheat but rather an IPA and the 4.8% ABV doesnt seem right either.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1510,"2014-09-09",3.6,"16oz can acquired via trade. Thanks! Glad to finally try the hoppy ones. Pours a nice glowing decent hazed amber hue, some flashes of orange, some darker depth in the body and decent bubbly carbonation flows up its edges. Decent cakey layer sticks around small, nice stickaround and lacing overall. Aromas are potent hops, nice big grapefruit and florals meet, fresh with lemon, grapefruit rind, some gentle pine. Soap, fruity and bitter. Touches of gumball, faint melon with subtle bready malts, bit of biscuit and grain. Nice, fresh, definitely enticing. Initial is a bit more reeled in, flashes of citrus rind, bitter florals and softened bready malts. A bit grainy, dry with some decent hop character. Citric character is decent but fleeting. More bready, a bit powdery into the middle. Floral, soapy. Some gentle oxidation and fruit into the middle. Backend is decent bitterness, softened body. Not sweet but earthy, bitter and dry with florals, some powder and faint soap. A waft of pine, the citrus element from the nose and front end falls out for me a bit much. While the nose offers some life and beer it certainly hoppy, it seems to lack character for me. Perhaps a touch of age or perhaps just not a fan of the blend. The Amarillo makes itself well known in the nose but any sort of Citra influence seems a bit lost to me. Some jabs of tropical influence slowly settle in and gently nip at times after the beer settles down, but still seem a bit vague. Overall, this is a solid offering and nice beer Id drink fairly often if available locally (and easy) that doesnt quite deliver on expectiations.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

1510,"2014-08-29",4.0,"Thanx Brandon,
This was poured into a pint glass.
It started off with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dissipated. Some light clingy lacing stuck here and there.
The smell had a whole lot of juicy tropical fruit with a solid bitter citrus invading and going nuts on my nose. Also, theres a nice floral presence over a light wheat malt.
The taste was mainly all about the juicy tropical fruit coming through sweetly. Theres just a tad more wheat in the flavor than the nose.
On the palate, this one sat fairly light and sessionable. Theres not much of a wheat kick and that could be due to the need to keep less to balance to the ~5% aspect. No worries as this is a definitely a well deserved session beer.

American pale wheat ale
4.8% ABV 
46 IBU 

APPEARANCE: Poured a hazy golden sunset, spots of orange like that last brightness of fire before the sun dips beyond the mountains. The head is nice and billowy with loose bubbles that settled into a nice small halo. 

AROMA: Bam! Hit in the nose with a tropical fruit salad. Mango, pineapple, apricot, banana. Followed with a small slightly hidden pine resin that's surrounded by fresh cut tropical flowers. 

TASTE: I actually get more citrus fruit on the taste followed by bright hops. Nice grainy bread malts come into at without being overwhelming. Nice long, dank finish. 

MOUTHFEEL: medium body and carbonation, drinks very light and refreshing. The lower ABV and super mellow bitterness makes this a great session beer. 

OVERALL: I wish I could have this all the time. I stock up on my Cali road trips. It is an amazing all around beer that I've found pretty much everyone across the board can drink and enjoy. Great job Modern Times!

It is not often you come across a wheat ale so good that it sits head and shoulders above almost all the other beers you get to try (including a number from Stone). Of the five beers on draft this was far and away the best. No wonder Modern Times was recently voted a Ratebeer favorite.

Aroma / Appearance - A carbonated golden body shimmers and bubbles. Minimal head provides some company. A hop driven combination of florals is centered around fresh roses. Lemon, wheat, and toasty undertones add a nice depth. Bright, airy, and fresh, it is like a walk on the beach.

Flavor / Palate - Hoppy florals tickle the tongue. Citrus and honey emerge after a few sips. The fresh feel lasts all the way through a complete finish. A wonderful session beer puts to rest the idea that bigger is always better. If you can only get one can make sure it is this one.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1510,"2014-03-29",3.6,"can via trade. nose is slightly tropical with a grassy character. fairly hazy pale yellow color. large white head, very foamy. taste is quenching but the hop character is weird with this one. crackery malt backbone but not sweet at all.

1510,"2014-03-22",4.0,"Pours golden and clear with big aromas of hops and tropical fruit. The taste is super fresh hops up front. This leads into more tropical flavors with pineapple and fresh citrus with the subtle and smooth finish of wheat. Really really good. Doesnt fall into the spiced with corriander and orange peel that other wheats do and this shows what can happen when wheat goes IPA.","Florida, USA","Weezel"
1510,"2014-03-20",4.0,"Sampled on 3/20/2014. This wheat ale pours a medium yellow gold color from a 16oz can. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity and sweet, pineapple, mango and other tropicals, with some hops. A medium bodied wheat ale. The malts are cereal and wheat, fruity and sweet. The hops are citrusy and piney. Decent carbonation. A lot of tropical flavors, yet not overly sweet and the hops give it a nice dry finish. This one would make a very nice summer session beer, crisp and clean, light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

Tropical fruity, orange peel, mango, spicy hoppy, piney, grapefruit, and bready aroma. Taste is orange juice, light wheat, pineapple, pine sap, papaya, weed, and cracker malt with a medium juicy bitter finish. Medium-to-full mouthfeel with crisp carbonation. Really solid offering and hard to believe they packed this much flavor in a beer below 5%. I am going to crush a ton of these this summer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
1510,"2014-03-19",3.4,"Can, picked up at some Whole Foods somewhere in San Diego. Pours clear gold with frothy white head that lasts and lasts, accompanied by a steady stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is equal parts citrus and bread. None of the tropical blast Id been expecting from the commercial description or previous reviews. Maybe an old can? No way to know, and Id been lead to believe these things turn over fast in town. A bit of pine, but very much dominated by bread in the aroma. Taste: Quite dry. Toast, wheat cereal (was just eating frosted mini wheats to prepare myself for this, and the shredded wheat comes through nicely). Dough, moderately piney bitter finish. Is there onion there too? Palate: light body, lively carbonation, very quaffable. Overall: If Im ever back in San Diego, Ill try this on draft.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

1510,"2014-03-16",4.5,"Purchased at Wallys in Los Angeles, CA; enjoyed at my cousins place after a great day of hiking before destroying some Aloha big burgers at Jolibee. This is going to be a tough one for me, because I would say this is a better wheat beer than Gumballhead, which is one of my favorites. Appearance is a lightly cloudy golden amber with a thin white rim. Aroma is equal parts citrus, mango, and pineapple, almost juice like but not overtly sweet, great aroma. Taste is like an IPA without the bitter bite and the tropical fruit characteristics. I could drink way more of these than Gumballhead, which is kind of scary. Maybe its good that this isnt available in Chicago. Definitely a brewery that Ill keep on my radar, really really good stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

1510,"2014-02-26",4.0,"This pours a hazy light orange with lemon yellow hues. Softly pastel with a thin head of loose foam that fell too fast to a very thin ring and left no lace. Nose bounds out of the glass with pine! Then mango and stone fruits. A crisp dry wheat scent with a touch of sweetness and hinting at bread. Lightly floral but to really intrigue this beer has a touch of hearty green herbal on it. Taste is light and bountiful with fruit. Mango, apricot, some tangerine. Brilliantly light on the palate. The malt is a crisp wheat cracker thats not too sweet. The herbal is the stuff that could have made onion but it stayed just shy and is delightful because it did not reach an oniony flavor. Faint little bit of pepper in the finish and as this warms a honey like scent. There is a hop bitter but its gentle and starts in the mid palate. The pine is earthy and prominent. There is a touch of sour undertaste to the malt. By the time it gets to the short finish its practically gone and this drinks like a dream. Refreshing and so easily you could have a dozen of these in a day and not get bored.","New York, USA","pinkie"

1510,"2013-08-09",4.0,"Pours golden yellow with medium white head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of crisp green apple, grassy hops with a hint of mango. Taste very crisp and refreshing with a noteable wheat flavor. Big grassy hops and a bright pine note make this a great wheat option for hops. I am truely surprised and very pleased with this beer.","Oceanside, California, USA","Sathorael"

1510,"2013-08-05",3.9,"Tap at Churchills in Escondido. Big lace on a sparkling light gold to straw color. Nose is dank/bright tropical hops, mild plastic. Taste is spicy with fresh Habanero, grass, pithy melon, dough. Palate has moderate butter but is light, refreshing. Sessionable. My favorite of the day probably. Nice job Mike!","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1510,"2013-07-27",3.2,"Pours a honey golden yellow, with a roiling head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of grapefruit. Definite grapefruit flavor (almost to the point of it being a fruit beer - very strong). A definite chuggable beer.

1510,"2013-07-27",3.2,"Draft. Amber beer with a whitish head. Wheat and citrus aroma. Grapefruit and spice flavor with wheat and malt. Medium bodied. Grapefruit and wheat linger with light earthiness.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
1510,"2013-07-07",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2014 Rerate:  Poured from 16oz. can.  Pours a hazy light orange with a small white head and some lacing. Aroma is of citrus, pine, tropical fruits, light dankness, and wheat bread. Taste ia about the same as the aroma with the addition of some sweet malts, and toasted wheat. Has a medium light body with a creamy mouthfeel, and a dry, semi bitter, refreshing finish. Overall, a very tasty and hoppy wheat ale that is highly sessionable.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
