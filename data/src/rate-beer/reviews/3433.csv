Thanks, Chris!

Was super excited to get a chance to try this one. I forgot that I had a taster of the 2016 version at my most recent trip to The Bruery, but was excited to get to do a full review on it. I mean a curious blend of our bourbon barrel-aged stout, Black Tuesday, along with our Flemish-style sour red ale, Oude Tart, this beer is unique and delightful. This one is going to be good.

Poured a medium-to-dark brown murky color with about 1-to-2 fingers of khaki tan head in the taster glass. Above average lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled sour cherry, chocolate, vanilla, cherry vanilla ice cream, toasty bourbon and toffee. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted tart cherry, bourbon, cherry vanilla, toffee, roasted chocolate, a touch of oak and rather boozy. (Taste - 4.00)

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.00)

Overall this was a really good sour stout. I much prefer regular Black Tuesday and Oude Tart, but I did like this spin on it. (Overall - 4.00)

3433,"2016-05-07",4.3,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/13/2015. Pours hazy very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, cranberry, raspberry, currant, plum, red grape, chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, toasted oak, bourbon, leather, light red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge sour cherry, cranberry, raspberry, currant, plum, red grape, chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, toasted oak, bourbon, leather, light red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Moderate acidic/tannic tartness and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, raspberry, currant, plum, red grape, chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, toasted oak, bourbon, leather, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from acidity/oak spiciness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/acidic/tannic balance mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible blended sour. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth to sip on for the big ABV and elevated acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3433,"2015-11-15",4.5,"De Grote Black Tuesday Tasting: 13 Versions. For all versions: 750 ml. bottles sampled. 2011 Black Tasting (4.1/5) vs. 2013 Black Tuesday (4.3/5). Neither were gushers unlike the 2012 I tried once before. Both pour very dark brown with some black, virtually no head in both cases. Some lone bubbles with the 2011, nothing at all with the 2013. Alcohol is huge in both cases, a touch lower in the 2011, some light oxidation & varnish notes in the 2011, thick bourbon, mocha, Alcohol is even bigger in the nose with the 2013, harsh & brutal. Raw white spirit almost. More mocha, sweeter chocolates & very thick mocha in the nose in the 2013. 2011 carries some light oxidation in the taste, less raw, big burning alcohol in the finish but overall a bit muted, some weird notes here, leaves, varnish, touch oxidation, making this one the lesser one of the two. You also get hugely thick molasses, harsh bourbon, Body is low carbonation & molasses, pure syrup. Booze is huge, in the 2013, vodka, raw spirit, burns, the taste is niches, thick syrup, more cacao, chocolate, sweet cacao nibs, not getting oxidation here, molasses, chocolate syrup. Same thick molasses. Overall a fun beer due to its extremity but it is also bit of a caricature, too excessive. Overall I am not crazy about it but I do like but it far from all that impressive. Winefication I (4.2/5) + Winefication II (4.4/5) (obtained in a trade with AdamChandler. Thx!) side-by-side. Winefication I pours a very deep red Bordeaux, little bubbles. Nose is quite strange, the two components seem to clash a bit here, molasses, mocha, sweet, umami, big roasted oak, soy sauce with thick dry sweet red wine, odd. Taste is huge oak, massive roast, wine character dominates, this one is a bit hard to describe for me, raisins, huge dry strong boozy red wine with huge church incense taste, dry, red grape skins, touch plastic, fruit punch, Thick & dry. Very much a strong basic red wine with some components that clash a bit, interesting to say the least. Winefication II is hugely different, also massively wine-like but just a different wine. This one is a better wine, less conflict here just a supper thick wine. Pours a very dark red Bordeaux, little bubbles. Nose is light mocha but largely hugely vinous, lots of oak, dry red grapes. Taste is huge oak, lots of roast (very much as was the case with the I), lots of roasted barrel, interesting mix of licorices, wine leaves, wine ranks, red grape, huge dry red frape spins, light plastic, vinous, warming (strangely tasted about as strong as I despite the huge ABV difference),.. Very thick, weird, unique & interesting. Melange #1 (4.5/5).Very dark brown, solid mocha head. Nose is huge red wine, balsamic vinegar, very tart, puckering red fruit, Not getting any Black Tuesday here. Taste is puckering sour red grapes, wine, faint glue, balsamic vinegar, pomegranate, sour cherries, Very thick body & puckering. Lovely. Not getting any Black Tuesday here oddly & like it more than Oude Tart. Quite simple but also very nice. This should be the 3rd batch made. Melange #3 (3.8/5): Very dark brown with a deep red hue and no head. Nose is weird, almost a bit like Black Tuesday (dominates heavily) with something sourish (White Sap I suppose), glue, bourbon, heavy alcohol, glue, oak, lots of bourbon. Taste is weird, faintly sour vanilla, thick bourbon, boozy Black Tuesday, molasses, thick basic licorice, syrup, Thick, boozy. Strange mix. Doesnt fully work for me. Least favorite of the 13. Chocolate Rain 2013 (4.7/5): Very dark brown to black, only some bubbles as is usual. Nose is huge thick sweet mocha, milk chocolate, vanilla, sweet bourbon, thick candy, molasses, thick & sweet. Taste is huge vanilla, bourbon, warming, mocha, vanilla, cacao, sweet chocolate, molasses, thick, sweet. Awesome, this is the 3rd time I have this beer, still surprised by how well it really works. So much better than the base beer. Grey Monday (4.2/5): Black / brown, zero head as usual. Hugely alcoholic nose, syrup, mocha, molasses. Taste is hugely boozy, molasses, thick syrup, very straightforward & basic, mocha, exotic sugar. Very basic, body is alcohol & molasses. Second time I have this beer & I am still not getting the hazelnuts. This one is still a bit pointless for me. 2013 Mocha Wednesday (4.4/5): Black, dark brown with no head. Nose is weird charcoal, ashes, burned wood & hugely roasted espresso beans. Taste & smell carries so much more roast & coffee than I remember this one having. Taste is burned mocha, charred barrels, huge roasted espresso, molasses, charcoal, mocha, sugar & molasses sweetness in the back. Basic but nice, quite an interesting heavily roasted espresso tastes & charred barrels. Thick body as usual. Rum (4/5), Madeira (4.4/5) & Port BA (4.4/5) versions next to each other. First two look as expected, very dark brown, dash black with basically no head. Port one has very dark red hue. Rum is the least one, even less than the base beer. Kind of pointless since the rum is far too muted & doesnt seem to add much, the base beer sort of drowns it out. Nose is sweet booze, mocha, very basic, pretty much Black Tuesday without bourbon, more sugar. Taste is boozy overly syrupy, barrel, big oak, very alcoholic, basic brown sugar, candy, mocha, roast, brown sugar. Okay but less than regular Black Tuesday & clearly lesser than Madeira or Port. Madeira: nose is hugely sweet mocha, sweet sugar, light complimentary barrel, sweet light red wine, faint red fruits. Taste is hugely sweet, spirit, coated in oak, old strong wine, huge brown sugar, vinous alcohol, sugar, oak, molasses. Thick chewy. Works rather well. Better than regular Black Tuesday & prob. my fav. of these 3 (Rum, Madeira & Port). Hard to choose between this one & port. Port: nose is huge red wine, massively so with strong alcohol, candy & lots of barrel. Taste is huge port, red wine, booze, light molasses, plenty of barrel, roast, oak, light chocolate, thick. Quite interesting & nice, also better than the regular one for me. Final one: Black Tuesday Reserve (4.6/5). Usual appearance. Nose is huge bourbon, warming, toffee, molasses, bourbon, boozy but oddly less so than the regular one, this is one is much rounder, chocolate, caramel, fruity even. Taste is vanilla, huge mocha, chocolate, overripe fruit, molasses, cereal, sugar, warming, syrupy, finish is heavily booze but the booze is in the back here as opposed to everywhere in the regular, barrel, oak, cacao, mocha. So much rounder, richer. Way better than expected, nice surprise, very big beer.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

3433,"2015-01-11",4.0,"From notes. This was shared at a tasting put on by @mikem409 on November 7. Shared from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a medium brown with some light ruby hints flashing through in the light. The head is thin, small and darker tan. It just hangs around as a film. The aroma is a big blast of roasty malt to start before moving through a little tart fruitiness and into a light chocolate and a bit of sour on the far back end. The flavor is a little more roasty throughout. There is a bit of sourness, and then a deep dark fruit. I like how there is a combination of a good stout and a good sour happening here. I wish it were more like a sour stout, but that would be greedy. The mouth feel is lighter and ell carbonated, but doesnt hang around and coat the mouth as well as Id like. The finish is very dry and sour. Much more of the Oude Tart here than Black Tuesday. Alcohol is well hidden, and this is solid. I just wish there were a little more of a sour stout to it.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Cherry skin, redcurrant, tart dark fruits, all laid out across an underbelly of roasted malt & burnt caramel flavors.

3433,"2013-12-07",3.2,"I quite like Oude Tart and I also mostly like Black Tuesday (in small quantities). Lets see how this super blend weighs in. This is 2013s edition of Melange #1 from the Bruery. Enjoyed at 55 in a stemmed glass. 

A - Pour is a very dark red out of the bottle. In the glass, it resembles an almost black sort of dirty dish water. Not winning any awards for appearance.

S - The nose is most certainly Black Tuesday. I get tart, oak cherry pie notes but the chocolate, molasses and tobacco come through strong.

T - I would call this a baby Black Tuesday with an infection. Everything about BT from the chocolate, roasted almonds, tobacco and licorice are here. Theyre just more muted, far less boozy and theres a hint of tartness. Its no where close to a 50/50 blend. Tastes more like an 80/20. The ABV suggests 50/50 though. 

M - Creamy, bold and very dry. 

O - This year being the highest ABV ever means theres more Black Tuesday in this blend than previous years. Nose and taste totally reveal that. Its nice but not something Id drink often. Maybe Ill let the other 2 bottles I have of this sit for a little while before opening them.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a huge bubbly mocha head that slowly recedes. 
I can smell the fruity tartness as soon as I wrangle the bottle opener through the wax and pop the top. Tart cherries with a roasted coffee, chocolate and caramel background. Light oak and vanilla mixed with spirits. The flavor feels more stout like than the aroma lead me to believe. A solid sweet coffee caramel and chocolate with a hint of molasses and smoke. Up front I get a pleasant dark dried fruity/cherry tartness that at first seems to belong in a stout but the tartness builds towards the end of every sip. Light lactic bite and little to no hops to be found. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet tart almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is an interesting beer, it is certainly unique and I enjoyed it. I really like both of the base beers in this blend, but I question whether the sum is greater than the parts here.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

I really had no idea what to expect when I first heard of this beer. I just couldnt fathom how two awesome beers, Black Tuesday and Oude Tart, could be blended together to create anything remotely palatable. Ive been wrong before.

The beer is brown / black with a decent sized head that leaves copious lacing all over the glass.

Like Sour in the Rye, this one brings the yeast and bugs. And those who know me know that I do enjoy my yeast and bugs.

The flavor brings oak, bourbon, roast, sour cherries, funk, chocolate. Wow. This is one of the most interesting (good) beers Ive had (Bud Clamato was pretty interesting too). The beer seems to be comprised more of Oude Tart than Black Tuesday, but they both shine through nicely. I cant believe how tasty this is. Im in disbelief, as I cant imagine this combination working so well. 

The feel is medium to full bodied and brings an acetic finish.

Pours a dark brown color with a small creamy tan head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a bit of chocolate and molasses. Behind that is brown sugar and a good amount of bourbon plus a strong oak and cherry cherry. Mild dark fruits a good dosing of acidity. The flavor carried a strong cherry presence that actually overwhelmed the Black Tuesday portion by just a bit. Nice thick roasty and chocolate stout paired with a cherry sourness. Description is dead on. Perhaps a bit too acidic in the finish, as it didnt quite gel with the full, creamy body. At least, thats where I stand. Glad I have a bottle of this and looking forward to seeing how it ages out.

Surprisingly, a sour beer, good roast with a bit of thickness, roast added from the Black Tuesday, but a dominant Oude Tart blend. Finish is tart, roasty falls into the backend. Some acidity, tart red cherries, light cocoa, oakiness. A quality beer, surprisingly. One that is drinkable and Oude Tart slanted, allowing it to cut through any big cloying maltiness and sweet thick caramel/molasses that youd expect to take over immediately from the Black Tuesday component.

3433,"2011-04-03",4.0,"A soft pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a glass filling three-finger thick head and then procedes to grow another two-fingers in height above the glass; the head is a brown tinged, dark tan color.  The beer is a dark, concentrated brown color that shows opaque, though a touch lighter brown in shade, when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of toasted whole grain roasted malt, burnt fruit, a light tartness, some musty, perhaps even musky notes as well as a sort of floral sour fruit note (that is more unripe than ripe), perhaps it is plum (as it warms this plum note becomes even more noticeable), touches of cola, spicy clove character and dark cocoa notes.  This beer smells more of the roasted, dark grain character than of the funkiness of a sour beer, but the two combine to form a pretty smooth smelling beer.  The fruitiness seems to get wrapped up in an almost, ripe, cheese like note; definitely farmhouse though not overly funky and heavy on the muskiness. 

Soft and creamy textured, the beer is definitely fairly sour (though it is actually quite tame compared to the Santa Fe #5 I just had), but this mixes with a rich, cocao and dark maltiness that really smoothes things out quite a bit.  I really cant believe how malty this beer is; especially up front of each sip, it almost has a richness to it.  The body is actually fairly light textured for how malty this beer can seem at times; it is lightened up considerably in the finish as the sour beer takes over by contributing a lactic tartness that combines with a light, burnt grain acidity as well as with a bright fruitiness that reminds me of plums.  There is quite a bit of whole grain, brown bread toasty character in this beer, especially in the middle of each sip.  The finish seems to focus on the sharper, roasted, darkly toasted, Stout like notes that even manage to add some roast grain bitterness to the finish.  Lots of sour fruit notes are in this beer, it is more of a non-descript fruitiness, but if I had to describe it plum certainly seems the best descriptor, but perhaps also touches of oxidized cider, a hint of kiwi somehow as well as a fermented, yet still lightly sweet, raisin juice; this last is almost to the point of making this vinous, like a fruity oak-aged red wine, maybe even port like at times.  Speaking of oak, there does seem to be a touch of structured woodiness to the finish that provides a touch of astringency, and now that I am thinking of it, there is a definite, oak-derived spiciness that provides some peppery heat in the lingering finish.  Other spice notes of clove and allspice provide some turpene structure to the woody pepper notes.  A really soft, subtle note suggest at some plasticizers, though this is barely perceptible. 

This is an interesting mix of dark chocolate, malted grain character, somehow piquant but subdued tartness, and ripe fruitiness.  I wasnt quite to sure what to think of a mix of Imperial Stout and Flanders type sour and I still dont; I am enjoying it though, even though the right side of my brain keeps on thinking that these flavors I am getting cant quite possibly work together, but my left side says that they do.  This beer is a fascinating experience; I almost want to describe it as sloppy genius, the individual components certainly dont work together, but somehow as a whole they do.  This could have been a complete train-wreck, but in the end it isnt remotely.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I love sour beers but to add ridiculously acetic bile into a chocolate burnt overly sweet beer makes for a a monstrosity.  Just because something is full of sourness doesnt make it good.

S: I pick up the chocolate notes from Black Tuesday right away. This gives the beer a pleasant richness and sweetness that goes along nicely with some roasted malt flavors underneath. The young Flemish sour provides some mild cherry notes as well as a hint of tartness.

T: The tartness is subtle on the flavor and is mainly in the form of cherries. The chocolate and roast components dont seem to be quite as powerful as they were on the nose, at least initially.

Still a beautiful pour, though, cloudy and peachy. Smells like Pork Lo Mein, candy, or sweet corn. Very odd. Taste is loaded with sweet corn, grains, unhoppy bitterness. Has a decent body though.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3433,"2008-09-27",2.7,"Not a happy marriage in my opinion.  The only things that shined through for me were the stout bitterness and the lightness of the flemish red, making a funky, light, bitter beer.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
3433,"2008-09-11",4.3,"Cask at brewery. Wonderful blend of their Russian Imperial Stout and Flemish Red. I liked the blend of the RIS with the Flemish Red. It took away some of the sweetness of the stout and was very smooth. Finished dry with a slight alcohol burn. Complex and wonderful.","Orange, California, USA","kegbear"

dark walnut brown pour, a very nice combo of the roasty/chocolatey of an imperial with the vinuous characteristics of a flemish red. complex up front, finished smooth.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
