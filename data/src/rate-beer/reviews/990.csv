990,"2016-12-09",3.7,"12 oz bottle. Pale gold beer. Somewhat cloudy. Medium sized white head, lots of lacing. The aroma fresh, sweet grain and a lightly fruity Belgian yeast. Bready, doughy malt sugariness. The yeast profile has some nice apricot/raisin/grape fruitiness but it stays pretty clean. I can see how it would be good with food. Light earthy hoppiness with mild bitterness keeps the taste fairly clean. Mildly sweet. Very easy to drink. Light on the palate. Not exciting but solid, so Id say they hit their mark.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

990,"2016-07-26",4.7,"Box of beers from longstanding friend up east I dont see often enough. oh wow, creamy yet zesty somehow, high pressure hop hose cleaning it out, spinning the palate around like a country bumpkins head standing in middle of Times Square. Smells like outside, captures nature, a get away in a glass. Yeast is pronounced, in fact all the elements of the beer stand out distinctly. East Coast has its own flavor, this beer typifies that uniqueness Ive been blessed only to visit. Almost a little wild but totally under control of adept brewer keeping the elements contained in the cauldron of fermentation, bottling it up like a late summer snow globe.

The pour is a crystal clear lightly orange tinted bright yellow with a huge white head that falls to a bubbly film, leaving s good bit of lace as it falls. The aroma is interesting. There is a wheaty grassiness to this one before the yeastiness kicks in. Its not too bad, but its interesting. The flavor is very Belgian inspired. Lots of yeasty malts right up front and a very Belgian spiciness. The mouth feel is a little thick, especially for how it looks there is a soft carbonation and a lingeringly yeasty aftertaste.

990,"2015-10-07",4.0,"Bottle, a very thoughtful extra from Lukaduke, bottled 6/10/15 and drunk 10/7/15.Soft tangerine-copper-toned body shows great clarity, leaving light sediment behind. Light carbonation creates a small off-white head that quickly recedes to a ring.Awesome doughy-peppery nose smells like all the good things about Allagashs house yeast. No banana or peach, no alcohol, nothing sharp. A touch of earth, light apples/cider notes and soft vanilla-tinged doughiness and easygoing black pepper lingering on the end.Flavor continues to impress. Tight carbonation and a supply-malted body, especially given it size, propel delicious black pepper phenols, spicy/herbal hops, a pinch of honey and light vanilla, marshmallow and cellar notes on the finish. Its all wonderfully balanced and the maltiness plays wonderfully against the peppery phenols and light hop bitterness. Very, very drinkable; a table beer indeed, and a delicious one at that. One of the better table beers/abbey singels Ive had in a long time and much maltier than any that I can remember (most have a bit of an astringency/dryness issue). Wish you could buy 6 packs of this stuff around here. I would drink this all the time. Thanks so much, Luke!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
