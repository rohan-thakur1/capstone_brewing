3222,"2016-03-05",2.1,"Tap pour from a pitcher at Spicy Pie in downtown Fargo. Plastic pint glass. Golden with some orange and reddish undertones. Aroma is definitely a lager with malty characteristics. Taste is also slightly malty with a hint of hops. Trying to be low key and thats what Im getting. Easy to consume but not all that enjoyable. Feels like a cheap beer. You can find better.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

Flavors are of pilsner malt, white toast, and a bit of herbal hop. Light bodied with a balanced bitterness. Im typically quite dismissive of this style, but this was actually some clean and well balanced stuff. Surprisingly good.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
