Notes of yeast, cloves, and banana, as well.  Some caramel.  The occasional prickly feel.  Finish offered a bit of chocolate but was muddled.  Still, a sweet and rich beer that was so easy to drink.

1370,"2007-01-11",3.6,"Pours a lightly hazy, a touch murky, but with a brightly deep reddish color that almost takes on a purplish-amber hue.  The head starts out at about two-fingers thick and is a nicely tannish amber color.  The aroma is sweet and malty up front with a lightly toasty note in the finish that almost takes on a hint of smoke.  A rich, caramelized bready note is prominent in the middle aromatics as well as some light spicy notes that help to round things out.

The taste is quite a bit drier than 8I was expecting from the aroma, but it fits in perfectly as a hugely malty German beer that is not overly sweet (a product of decoction mashing perhaps).  A touch of salty, smoky peat is noticeable as part of the complex malt profile.  There is a touch of sweetness here, it is almost fruity with hints at berries and even something like pear.  Solid, freshly baked, crusty, caramelized bread notes and a light biscuit character round out the malt notes.  A lightly spicy hop note is here in the flavor as well.  It almost, in combination with the sweet malt notes, adds something like cinnamon flavor to the beer.  Definitely there is a nice spicy hop character that at times is herbal and takes on a light, yet balancing bitterness  in the finish.  This is definitely a nice beer, I think it might not be as fresh as I could like, but it is still quite tasty.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1370,"2006-06-11",3.5,"Any first impressions?
-A big-bubbled, fleeting head stands over the muddy, ruddy brown.
-The caramel of a scotch ale greets the nose, along with plenty of earthy yeast.
-Wet earth dominates the yeast character, letting the sweet fruitiness of dates converse with a few herbal hops.
-The quiet carbonation provides an easy, lean mouthfeel.

What if you dig deeper?
-Wooden, herbal hops soon appear in the nose, behind all the yeast and sweetness.
-Some berry fruitiness is found when digging through patches of wet soil.
-This is another idiosyncratic brew from Bürgerbräu, which Im sure performs even better fresh vom Fäss.

Although it smells like it will be a great beer, ithe flavor is somewhat bland.  There is a good malt presence, but thats about all this beer has going for it.  There is some brown sugar, spices, and raisins initially on the palate, but it finishes very thin and watery.

1370,"2006-04-15",3.4,"Bottle producing a deep garnet/maroon body, opaque, with a creamy head.  Looks chewy.  But it isnt really.  A little bit like a vintage beer, with some significant caramel, wood, nut (whole toasted almonds) flavors and a little raisin touch.  Tingling palate, at first seeming thin but really not that dramatically thin, somewhat lilting.  You might claim to find a little metallic touch in the finish, the influence of some German hopping on top of what is otherwise a bold bock with only moderate sweetness despite the obvious malt character.  It gets more rewarding with continued drinking.  I would love to have German measures of this beer on tap, in Germany, with a plate of wurst, spaetzle, red cabbage, sauerkrat, and gravy.

1370,"2005-06-14",3.8,"Reddish amber, very cloudy. The head that forms a top of it looks like the top of the rocky mountains, in the clouds mind you. Intricately fruity nose surprises me because of its syrupy edge that I somehow associate with a purple aroma, some flower Im not familiar with. The fruit top ground is sleeping in a yeast pillow, it might be old for it shows more musty character than Id expected even from such a yeasty line. Light caramel and damp earth catch into the floral hallertau to bring out weird oregano and grapes flavours, branches included, pretty vegetal in fact. The first thing I think of when sipping (and it might be pure hazard with this beer) is blood oranges. Growing on you tart character, earthy, dry and fruity, a few grapes were left in the old attic of the country house you just bought. Apples, pears, cherries etc. Fun beer, I want more by the end of the glass. Fairly light bodied still, though fully carbonated. One of those mysterious beers that Id need to have 2-3 of before figuring out how I feel about them.

1370,"2004-08-25",3.9,"2004 bottle (I presume).  I was reading style guidelines and usual characteristics of dunkels before trying this (having not had too many of the style).  It surprised me how well this seemed to fit the style; almost exactly.  Medium brown color, nice and cloudy from the bottle conditioning.  Some light auburns and dull copper tones in there as well.  Head was small and mostly fleeting but present: a light beige color.  Aroma has toffee, sweet nuttiness and hints of caramel and yeast.  Little hops in the aroma.  Flavor is wonderful.  Starts out with a big caramel malt mixed in with the lager yeast that is lightly pungent, and adds great complexity without getting dominant.  Hops surprisingly do make an appearance, probably from the freshness of this beer; they are lightly spicy and a bit astringent.  The chocolate characteristics present are more of a rich milky/caramelly chocolate, not much cocoa at all.  The body is medium and the palate has a bit of a zip to it (could be a bit more smooth, but thats a bottle conditioned lager, I guess).  Wonderful beer, this brewery is outstanding.  It could use a bit less hops though.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Wants to be drunk quickly, and Im having to resist.  Has almost a thin malted-milk texture, it is so smooth and drinkable.  Hops just barely extant.

1370,"2004-06-23",3.6,"The color at medium orange amber seemed a bit too light for a dunkel.  The pour indicated a medium carbonation level that formed a one-finger thick short lived fizzy head.  The smell was bready sweet malt and earthy yeast with some light hop aroma.  The smell reminded me a lot of the English Ales I had been drinking lately.  The taste indicated a main flavor reminiscent of sourdough bread and some fruitiness in the form of apples and pears.  The hop bitterness was quite restrained.  There was also a bit of a tangy citric sourness.  The beer was very easy to drink, as there were no funky flavors in the aftertaste.

The sweetness and thickness left a round taste on the tongue.  There really is nothing negative I can say.  If this were a little more over the top (higher gravity, stronger spices) i dont think it could retain its charm.  I like where it sits, as a great spring/fall substitute for a belgian strong ale.

1370,"2003-07-28",3.4,"Dark amber in color. Roasted chestnut aroma with notes of grassy hops.  Rich and nutty with some peated scotch ale-like malts in the middle.  Dry, nutty and flowery at the  end, but the sweet malt taste lingers.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
1370,"2003-07-04",3.6,"Big toffee and caramel aroma.  Rich copper body, creamy tan head, nicely carbonated.  Flavor is toffee, prune, caramel, and bready, with an almost toasted feel in the aftertaste.  Not as malty as a good doppelbock, but with similar character.  A good European session-style beer.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1370,"2003-06-10",3.5,"Pours a ruby copper brown with a good sized tan head.  Aroma is of a standard malty German lager with some acidity.  Body is bready, sweet and earthy with a dry mellow finish.  This is a decent beer, but nothing spectacular.  A good example of the style.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1370,"2003-05-23",3.3,"Light brown, not mch head.  Nose is malty, hops are definitely noticeable.  Malts predominate with the usual caramel tones, but held back by the sweetness.  Hops definitely assert themselves at the end, some good bitterness.  Lacks body, is a bit thin in the middle, could use to be a bit stickier.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
1370,"2003-05-17",3.8,"Very attractive medium brown, hazy appearance.  Nice off-white head.  Malty, spicy aroma.  Toasted malts  blended with a butter toffee taste to leave a well- rounded overall impression.","Hanover, Maryland, USA","guzzler67"
1370,"2003-05-13",3.9,"Highly carbonated brew.Nearly no head,what was there faded into nothingness fast.Nice color,light amber to some what brown.Malty sweet aroma slightly spicy some hints of yeast as well.Malty taste and i think i can even detect the alcohol in this one.It doesn't seem possible at 5.5% but its there.Slightly sweet,with a mild bitterness at the end but it doesn't last long all in all an ok beer,but kind of pricey for what you get.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
1370,"2003-03-27",3.7,"Dark amber color with a small bubbled tan head.  Sweet malt aroma, thin mouthfeel.  Ends a bit weak.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
1370,"2003-03-26",3.9,"Ahhh,this was a good choice on this sunny/cool afternoon.Excellent looking,glowing-oarnge,with a meaty, tan,head.Pleaseant,complex aroma.Big spicy hop/sweet malt lead the way with undertones of yeast and bread. Mouthfeel is soft and lusciously,thick.Fizzy beginning,with following flavors of nuts,bready,sweet malts.The finish starts out with lingering,caramel before the spicy hops are noticable.Great spicy hop burps.Slight yeast flavors come out but never stay.Excellent nutty/caramel lingering in the throat.Darn good!","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
1370,"2003-03-18",3.3,"Deep amber with a taller lasting off white head.  Slightly buttery malt aroma.  Flavors of sweet malt and light mocha.  Some wort like qualities (unfermented sweetness) that distract from the better qualities.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1370,"2003-03-18",2.9,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2011 Speckeld hazel; unfiltered.  Off white foam consists of large and small bubbles with moderate retention.  Aroma of iron, leaf, concord grape, buttered toffee, fruit cake, soft milk chocolate notes, black currant, and pecan.  Smooth palate.  Light acidity up front is quickly balanced by light chocolate, dark bread, vinous notes, soft earthy hop, and assorted nuts.  Lingering coffee, lightly burnt caramel, and light earthiness in the mellow finish.  With a more assertive aroma and malt depth to better counter the acidity, this would be markedly improved. Decent.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1370,"2003-02-20",3.3,"Dark chestnut color would be beautiful if you could see through the haze.  Very appealing spicy Hallertauer aroma (one of my favorite hops).  As I mentioned on my rating of the Wolnzacher Hell the malt/hop characters were very skewed by the yeast bite.  Too bad because it seemed as though a beer I would love normally.","Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA","Ducati"
1370,"2003-01-29",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2003 Cloudy dark copper with medium tan head.  Aroma is sweet, caramel, yeast, and some roasty, and is more complex than I'm used to having in a dunkel.  Taste is initially sweet and caramel, and then there's a delicate roastiness on the back half into the swallow.  A quality dunkel.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1370,"2003-01-22",4.2,"A very good beer.  Pours out to a cloudy amber in the glass resembling a glass of strong, freshly poured apple cider.  The head quickly leaves and in its place is a fresh aroma of malt and yeast.  The taste is very, very good.  There is a malt explosion that isn't overwhelming, but inviting.  I was waiting for a sweet finish due to the malt taste, but it was only light with a slight hop taste as well.  A very drinkable beer.  This brewery may only have been in existence since 1999, but they brew beer like they've beer around a long time.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","proc"
1370,"2002-12-10",0.6,"This is the worst beer that I have ever tasted in my entire life and I think this is the 222 beer that I have tried.  It smelled and tasted like vomit...I hope that I had a bad bottle so that I can justify its rancidness.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
1370,"2002-11-27",4.0,"Ive had very few dunkles, and have always found them to be a hair too sweet, and I always was left wanting a touch more hops. I found a great one here, sent by urbnhautebourg. Superbly crafted, very slightly caramelly sweet, excellently hopped, goes down as smooth as is possible for a beer -- yet it is in no way unchallenging. My advice is too really sit with this one and not to have it with food. This brewery is excellent!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1370,"2002-10-26",3.2,"Slightly sweet, good malt and spice.","Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, USA","gbzia"
1370,"2002-10-14",2.9,"Slightly hazt dark red color.  Semisweet nose of caramel and mat.  Body is spritzy with notes of smoke, roast and malt.  Finishes with a nice hoppy bite.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"

1370,"2002-10-01",4.2,"Beautiful ruby color with billowing head and lasting lace.  Malt has spice, graininess, chocolate, fruitiness.  Very complex, with hops in wonderful balance.  My favorite dunkel.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
1370,"2002-09-10",3.8,"Ruby amber, nice inviting sweet malt aroma.  Smooth clean lager flavor with nice balancing hops, with some spicy malt flavors.  Excellent dunkel.  mmmmmmmm...","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
1370,"2002-08-14",3.9,"Copper/ruby colored. Thin but persisten head and lace. Aroma of malt,spicy hops,peas and others. Malt and caramel on the palate, hallertauers are fantastic giving the beer a nice spicy/sharp kick. Light fruitiness (strawberry) shows itself up front. Texture is a tad watery but its not even a distraction. Damn fine dunkel!","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
1370,"2002-08-10",4.0,"Straight ahead well made dunkel. Chill haze. A rare bottle conditioned lager. Very rounded and smooth. A lovely dark lager.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
1370,"2002-08-04",3.8,"The Hallertau hops are barely noticeable.  The ale is dark reddish in the glass and oddly, I may be able to taste the 5.5% alcohol.  Very flavorful and tasty.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1370,"2002-08-01",3.4,"Nice color but the flavor was a little light.","Smithfield, Virginia, USA","bonvivant"
1370,"2002-07-27",4.1,"Clear reddish body, rising carbonation, medium head. I do get the strawberries in the nose. Malty, not particularly sweet, with just a touch of bitterness in the finish. Very nice.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
