2994,"2014-02-15",3.3,"Leighton, thanks for the solid hookup, bro. This shit is crazy. Pours an oily midnight brown with no head. Coats the glass. Soy, chocolate/cocoa beans, syrup, molasses, brown sugar, prunes, maybe a thick-ass old port wine, and a splash of balsamic. Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a syrupy, coating mouthfeel.

Nose is major charred brown sugar, Mikkeller black style, amaretto, almost sweet like Port or Madeira, huge prune juice. Taste is sweet, cherry juice, prune, oily.

2994,"2013-12-01",4.2,"Beautiful refreshing drink with lemonade...this malt is taken (not drunk)..for its perceived medical and nutritional benefits"", notably its high vitamin C content. Second, it is not sipped neat, but diluted with lemonade or milk. When mixed with the former it becomes ""Sheffield Stout"" and tastes like a malty cross between dandelion and burdock and bitter shandy, with a faint caramel kick. Cant believe this is now out of production after the Governments budget tax relief changes. Such a shame and loss of heritage.","Batley, West Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Mandson1"

It is so thick it almost holds it shape in your mouth. Too thick to be oily. Tastes like a rich port with molasses, brown sugar and raisin bread. So thick it coats the glass.

2994,"2013-10-23",3.2,"680ml bottle. added to lemonade to make a long drink as suggested. also drank it straight and can see why people would review it poorly if they did the same. drink it as youre supposed to and its nice. 
anyway... on its own, pours as thick as treacle/tar. smells of star anise, absinthe, alcohol and lots of fermented fruit. tastes poor as it just clings to your tongue. very smooth but you have to chew it.
and with lemonade or a soft drink? tastes good. 6 lemonade: 1 black beer makes it slightly see through but it is still pretty damn black. you get the slight hint of star anise in the aroma but of course smells sweeter due to lemonade. taste is far better. toffee, caramel and the carbonation from the lemonade helps.
my suggestion is that people drink this both neat AND how its supposed to be drunk.","Dorking, Surrey, ENGLAND","olliejobbins"

Taste is overly sweet with a huge amount if raisins notes. This really tastes like a raisins syrup. Think mouthfeel with no carbonation.

Blind you could convince an aficionado it was port; aroma thick, rich, prune and Christmas pudding-sodden with a dunk of Marmite. Viscid and sticky beyond the thickest impy; deep, semi-dried black grape and malt loaf sweetness rendering it undrinkable neat in anything more than an eggcup.

2994,"2007-11-05",3.4,"680ml bottle from Morrisons in the fortified wines section. Black Beer is a Yorkshire speciality - Mathers was the first Black Beer, and is the only one left. It is usually classed as a Schwarzbier - but that is purely because of the name.  There is no decent fit. I think traditional ale or Malt Liquor. As the company calls it a Malt Liquor, that is how Im entering it. Its quite hard to drink at first because the texture is very thick. It coats the mouth and tongue in a dense slow manner, not quite syrup or treacle or honey, but sharing their qualities. It is sweet - but theres an attractive robust dark bitter edge like burnt toffee and bonfires and wood smoke and tree bark. There are no hops used, so the bitterness comes from the intensity of the roasted barley. My first couple of attempts at drinking this I found it too thick and sweet, and also a bit too dark and bitter. There are a number of ways of drinking it and a Sheffield Stout, where it is mixed with lemonade, appears to be the most popular with other drinkers. I tried that and found a palatable drink, but lacking in the character when drunk undiluted. Id recommend making a second or third effort at drinking it straight because this is an interesting and rewarding drink, as well as being a slice of history.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
