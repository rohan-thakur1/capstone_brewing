Mouthfeel is carbonated. The palate has graham cracker, well browned wheat toast, toffee and some caramel. There is a haunting spicy note to the palate, a little like cilantro or mint, maybe Thai basil. 

The finish is medium-long with some nice hoppy character to it. Hyssop-like bitter character, which blooms and lengthens into a beautiful aroma profile of floral baby powder and chrysanthemums. I think they started with a cream ale but coudnt stay their hoppy hand in the brewing.
