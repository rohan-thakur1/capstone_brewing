3091,"2013-08-13",3.6,"Half pour at the brewery, reviewed from notes. Aroma is lightly smokey, with a strong yeast presence that emits pear/apricot skins. Somewhat funky, slight lactic notes. Pours a hazy golden color that is unfiltered and a big soapy head that dissipates slowly. Leaves no lacing, no legs. Taste has bright sweetness immediately followed by a smokey, salty, meaty flavor. Funk taste is carried through that reminds me of hard cheese. At first it was hard to take down, but as it warmed up the flavors became more pleasant. The smoke is balanced by the light tart finish, and a nice mineral quality that brings out the base malt. Small fruit presence lingers. Thin body, with medium carbonation and a slight dry finish. Definitely the best smoked Saison Ive had. The smoke qualities are well balanced and not overpowering, which makes the finish of the beer refreshing.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"

3091,"2013-08-09",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Spicy pepper and orange aroma. Wheat-like grain in background. Hazy deep gold with full white head. Spice and lemon flavor. Crisp spicy phenols.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
3091,"2013-08-01",3.9,"Draft at the brewery. Light orange-yellow with a thin film that left some decent lacing. Nose is very interesting with spice, yeast, and some sweet malt that is complemented by mild hickory hammy/bacon smokiness. Taste is sweet with light bitterness and the idea of salt from the cured pork flavors. Along with that are clove notes, a little funk and yeasty sweet grain that dries out with some faint bitter notes. Medium body. This combination could easily be a mess but its no surprise that SARA did it so well.","Soquel, California, USA","tripelthreat"
3091,"2013-07-31",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Such a tough style to nail down.... smoked saison? Lots to keep in balance here, and they do it spot on. It pours yellow/orange with a disappearing white head. The aroma is lightly smoky with jerky, wheat and spice. The flavor is huge smoke yet light on the palate with fresh wheat, fruit and yeast melding beautifully with the smoke in the finish. Really good.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3091,"2013-07-27",3.8,"Aroma is slightly malty with faint cracker and grain, but is moderately smokey. Smoke is light in character; definitely not peat or cherry wood. Moderate pear esters. 
Pours a cloudy gold color with a thin white head that lingers on the edges. Only faint lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is moderately sweet in the beginning with some light graininess. Mid palate the flavor is all overripe fruit and is fairly sweet. The finish is balanced with medium light bitterness and moderate smoke flavor. The finish lingers with light smoke and some more graininess. Faint pear in finish as well. Light tartness to help balance the sweet and smokey. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately creamy with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth.
Overall a nice beer with well balanced smoke character. The smoke works well with the esters from the saison yeast. Could be a bit drier but that might make the smoke too apparent and unbalanced.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3091,"2013-07-25",4.0,"On tap at Sante Adairius. Aroma and flavor of Anais, but put through a smoker. Notes of campfire, sweet orange, lemon, light Belgian spice, and some yeast profile. Again, excellent mouthfeel and carbonation. Great beer.

3091,"2013-07-22",3.9,"On tap at SARA last Friday. Pours cloudy amber with a small white head and some lacing. Aroma is smoky, citrus, yeast, peppercorns. Smoke is more prominent after swirling the glass, but fades with time. Taste is fruity, lightly tart, only lightly smokey - more of an accent than a dominating characteristic. Light zesty bitterness present as well. Medium body, dry finish. Nice beer, as expected.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3091,"2013-07-20",4.0,"Pours a slightly brownish yellow, light oak. Glowy in the sun. Small white head. Little to no lacing and the bubbles fade pretty quickly. The aroma is a mix of light smoke and earthy saison flavors. Its all smoked mushrooms and fresh pale malt. Im always a little nervous about smoked saisons, and while this beer didnt wow me from the first sip, its quickly growing on me. Its like drinking a rustic saison in front of a campfire. Its relatively sweet with an umami kicker. The finish is refreshing and dry despite that meaty middle. Feel is full and relatively heavy for a saison, though light for a smoked beer, of course. Very interesting stuff. Id sorta like to try a twist on it, maybe fruit or barrel.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3091,"2013-01-06",4.1,"Pours a deep orange with a filmy white head. Intriguing smell of apricots, meat and salt. Actually a really nice combo of sweet and savory. Flavor is dry and complex, layers of smokey notes, cured pork and salty cheese. Ultra-fresh grains color the bone-dry finish. This beer contains multitudes, melded gracefully. Sublime balance between the smoke and the saison.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
