Apesar do rótulo caracterizá-la como uma (Dortmunder) Altbier, a simples inclusão da palavra Sour juntamente ao estilo aliada ao fato da mesma ter 10% de ABV (o BJCP prevê entre 4,3 e 5,5%) já invalida uma análise que ""penalize"" essa cerveja por não conter determinados elementos. O pouco que combinou foi a forte presença maltada na backbone da cerveja e ésteres frutados (lembrando cereja) que podem sobreviver ao processo de lagerização. A cerveja esconde muito bem o teor alcoólico, mas há certo aquecimento no final do primeiro copo. Cerveja complexa, para ser degustada bem lentamente.

Has a soft malty beginning, while a pleasant warmth flows through the body. Smoke flavor goes very well with the Altbier-character, adds a grainy complexity with subtle hints of salt to it. After the salt gets detectable on the palate along with wood and musty yeast, a huge sourness emerges and threatens to overwhelm the palate. As the beer warms up, the lactic acid driven sourness decreases, and leaves some space for zingy salts and wooden malts on the palate. Full bodied beer, which contains completely different layers, which all melt together in a very unique flavor. At first this seems to fail, due to the enormous sourness, which misses essential balance, but as the beer gets warmer it becomes very enjoyable. Leads to a long lasting vinous, roasted, sour finish.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Some gentle red fruit, mellow sourness on the nose is quite subtle, as this thing presents that firm darker malt feel. Initial is a touch bitter up front quickly moving to toast, caramel, biscuits and sweeter dark sturdy malts. Some dark fruit influence starts to grow, some raisins, gentle brown sugar and toffee. Gentle lactic element starts to hit into the middle, subtle but there, some gentle cherry meets more gentle toasty and roasty malts, biscuity and semi sweet at times. Backend is some currant, mellow sourness and biscuits trailing out. An odd combo, the sweetness and brown/biscuity caramel and lactic element doesnt necessarily play well for me. A bit warm, the size is significant and definitely can take you at times. Finish is some toastiness and lactic elements hanging on. Man, a bit clunky, Im not really sure where such a beer fits in. But its not quite my thing as a sour fan.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2584,"2013-08-20",3.9,"Bottl, thanks to ThirstyBird! 500 ml, filled to the top, ABV 10%. Poured into an altbier type glass but I am switching into a snifter after this. 
Clear body, very dark brown colour on the body, probably the darkest altbier Ive had till now. One finger of off-white to beige head, with good retention for its size and light lacing left on the glass.
Lighty roasted malts on the aroma and quite a usual altbier aroma but! with some sour white grapes this time, lightly acidic.
Very light sourness on the taste and even then, more on the aftertaste. Mostly roasted malts, chocolate, a little bit of coffee. Very balanced between sourness and bitterness, this tastes like a good, old Russian Imperial Stout. The alcohol very well hidden and if I keep drinking it out of this glass Ill be gone in no time.

The 10% ABV on the label is hard to read and to believe...Like an infinitely aged Gouden Band poured into an old Alt, this majestic Alt has all the dry, aged-on-oak qualities of a Flemish Sour Ale without the actual vinegar acidity. Oak astringent palate, swallowing all residual caramalt Alt sugars, reenforced by a rather austere earschmalz hop bitterness. Very impressed if this should actually pack 10%, and probably still more honestly categorised as an Alt than as a sour...","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"
