4031,"2016-10-18",4.0,"Tasted on 10/17/16 from a 16oz can, big thanks to Alex for this one. Pours cloudy, very bright, almost like a neon orange, with a thick, rocky white head that slowly recedes to thick lace. The nose is really aromatic, a great blend of dried orange peel, citrus blossom, a nice earthy herbal note, with just a tinge of pineapple. The flavor is really nice and juicy orange up front, moving to the more herbal orange peel and slightly green herbal note, with a very faint hint of bitterness. The body is medium, with a great texture, plenty of acidity to make my mouth water, average carbonation, and a long hint of bitter herbal orange peel finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

Aroma brings out fresh mangoes and papayas, a little orange, and piney hops. Flavour bursts of tropical fruitiness, particularly peach and citrus, with fairly bitter piney hops and just enough dry biscuity malt. Dry, somewhat astringent but bright finish. Exceedingly drinkable and fresh. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

4031,"2016-08-11",4.0,"The commercial description above pretty much covers all of the tasting notes I could possibly give this. Its like a more bitter version of Tree Houses Julius, with a ton of turbid haziness and the aroma of a fresh glass of orange juice.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
4031,"2016-08-09",4.4,"Extremely well-made and integrated pale ale. A bit different from the Fort Point series in that this is a bit lighter on the palate yet less masking of the bitterness. Fantastic.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"

The aroma consists of tropical fruit, hops, malt and a bit of green onion. Light to medium body with flavors of grapefruity hops, peach, and biscuit malt. The finish is mildly bitter with a lingering tropical fruit and hops aftertaste. Pretty good all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
4031,"2016-07-31",3.8,"Growler filled 7/22/16, drunk 7/27/16.Heavily hazy, dark copper tinted golden is topped by a strong, white head.Great hop combo shows off peach, pear, nectarine, white grape, spicy pineapple-mango and dank notes with a good dose of malt backing. Biscuity malts and oats, with some caramel-tinged grain suggestions from the crystal malt. It doesnt detract from the hops, though there is some slightly dull character, be it too much yeast (highly unlikely) or the particulate. No alcohol or flaw. Certainly juicy and enjoyable nose, though not quite as extensively lush and juicy as some of their best.The flavors I like less than the nose, mostly on account of a strong graininess that must be the caramel/crystal malt. That or whatever is dulling the aroma slightly, is showing up even more in the flavor. Just a bland, nutty, almost bready character. Its not heavy or hugely disruptive, but its enough to dampen the brightness and juiciness and cut at the soft, malty, finely-carbonated texture. Still a fantastic beer, however you look at it, but among my least favorite batches of any Small Bird Ive had.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4031,"2016-07-24",4.4,"Can dated 7/14. 10 days old. Aroma is huge pineapple, white grapes, and grapefruit. Tastes amazing. Dank, citrus and pineapple all balanced perfectly. Mild bitterness. So smooth. I want more.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

4031,"2016-07-16",4.1,"Opaque grapefruit color, which is normal for Trillium but still a little unsettling. But a beautiful big white head actually makes the beer attractive. Great aroma, of grapefruit, kiwi, honeysuckle, mandarin orange, grape, particularly concord grape. Woah. Flavor of grapefruit, orange, with notes of grape. Great smooth body, like a wheat ale without the wheat! Delicious.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","williamstome"
