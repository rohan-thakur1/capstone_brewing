A: Arrived as a hazy orange brew, with a thick white head of tiny, tight bubbles that left not only good lacing, but distinct level markers for each sip.

S: Alas, I was at a restaurant with a kitchen, so my olfactory was running with a skeleton crew at best. What I was able to pick up were heavy citrus notes, sour and tart, and some hints of a wheaten grain bill.

T: Yes, definitely tart. This opens with a mixture of citrus fruit notes with the full sourness one would expect from such a medley, and that sourness does not relent. Orange, lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine roll through, with some subtler hints of apple and green grapes, before a swell of farmland-esque funk comes in the middle. Beneath the tartness, there are notes of spices, the usual suspects for a mulled cider, though faint and muted. The finish is Mojave desert-level dry.

M: To be honest, I couldnt really tell around the sour and tart, so Ill just say theres no issues there.

O: Intense without sacrificing complexity to do so, this is an interestingly sour biere de garde. Would repeat.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Normally the words ""Ale brewed with chestnut and spices"" would ward me away from purchasing a beer, but in this case the words ""Jolly Pumpkin"" are on the label.

The aroma is tart and wild like barnyard with gentle nuttiness and caramel notes. The palate is a little lighter than I would like for this kind of thing, but not too bad.

Mouthfeel is medium-thin for me, not creamy but a little bit effervescent.

Taste: My first of the style, and... interesting. Cinnamon, fruit, sour, tart, sweet... its all over the place and should be a mess, but it isnt. Ive not had a beer like this before, and Im glad to finally have gotten the chance to try some Jolly Pumpkin.

Taste: Mildly tart with a small hint of vinegar, but it quickly picks up on a dry nutty and cinnamon/nutmeg finish that abruptly stops. Sort of a potpourri finish.
Palate: Light bodied with high carbonation.

Moderate carbonation, less than many sours, and a light, crisp body. Slightly tart, oily, finish. Not a very traditional belgian ale, it is more herbal like a sour saison.

Tasted on 12/2/12 from a capped 750mL bottle given to me by a very generous member of the beer community.

The beer is sunburst hued, rusty orange. The head is over an inch thick, and hangs out for several minutes, leaving a thick sheet of lacing in its wake. The aroma brings the anticipated Jolly Pumpkin funk, with spice, malt, citrus fruits, oak, floral notes. Really wonderful aroma. The flavor is complex, intriguing, and delicious. Super smooth, with a yeasty, funkiness about it. Lingering notes of citrus. No sign of alcohol. I had no problem whatsoever draining my half of the bomber. Recommended.

Appearance: Pours out a clear, clover honey-hued body with a foamy, slowly receding, barely off-white head (though, the latter pours turned out quite clouded). Glass glaze of lace on the descent.

Smell: Simple sugar cookies, faintly sweetish, heavily marked by musty yeasty notes, tart-scented hard cider, citrus, very faint oak sprigs, additional fruity hints, soiled, unwashed herbs.

Taste: Sweetish sugar cookie hints with some slight caramel nuttiness. Big gulp of farmhouse cider with hints of strawberry and one drop of that bright red sauce that comes with the sweet-n-sour chicken. Oak character with a childlike gentleness about it. Its got a tartness and some barnyard funkiness going on, but its very balanced within and amongst the other elements of this beer. Splash of salty, phenolic lemon juice. Tiny pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Ramping up of acidity on the dry, earthy finish.

963,"2009-02-01",4.0,"750ml bottle, Oct. 2008 batch.  Having had this beer several times, I can say it needs at least three months after its released to really come into its own.  It was released way too young IMO.  Moving on, it pours a really beautiful glowing, reddish honey with a pillowy beige head.  Awesome.  Gorgeous, vintage Jolly Pumpkin nose - softly-integrated brett, sour tropical fruits, and of course oak.  The flavor is vinous, subtle, and refreshing.  There is not that burst of flavor you might expect though.  This could be a phenomenal beer if the flavors were more pronounced.  I still really like it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

I was intrigued by the chestnut description, thinking this would be a bombastic style so often found in the Italian beers. No! Once again JP floods the aroma with the sour brett aroma, leaving almost no nose to be enjoyed. You take load of brett + slight chestnut and that sums up the aroma. Its rather disappointing that JP keep doing this to all of their beers.
Pours hazy golden with white head.
Aroma as mentioned earlier is just filed with brett, and has very faint notes of the chestnut and spices.

Bright and zesty aroma- Lemon rind, that musty Jolly Pumpkin yeast, some brett, and peppery citrus spiciness. Light and fluffy, crisp feeling. Zesty and spicy taste with lightly tart citrus and an underlying brett character. Some underlying oak meshes with grapefruit flavors. Again, seemed a bit less carbonated, and seemed to be missing much of the volume in the bottle, which leads me to believe it had leaked during transport.

Full semi-cloudy hazy orange appearance. The aroma was spices (cardamum and white pepper came to mind, but I don’t actually know what the heck they are half the time, lol), bret, yeast, nuttiness, floral hops (lavendar?). The flavor was all of the aroma, lots going on in here, white grapes, but perfumey floralness and too intense of spicing as it warmed were the faults in this one. Aftertaste included a nice touch of sawdust, but not enough to clean up the spicing and overly floral notes. Mouthfeel was lively, but that probably was not a great thing given the flavors I wanted less envigorated.

Apart from the spice (and everything else really is a side note), this one was super dry in the mouthfeel with very little sourness that usually attends a Jolly Pumpkin brew.

963,"2008-06-05",3.7,"6/05/2008:  Fuego del Otono (Autumn Fire) pours a mostly clear, light copper color with a HUGE, dense and rocky light beige head.  There is a substantial amount of carbonation that sustains the perpetual thick head that creates puffy lacing on the glass.  The aroma and flavor contain the tell-tale Jolly Pumpkin funk and spice.  Some spiced (cinnamon)  apple cider notes are also apparent in the aroma.  The flavor is lightly malty, fruity (like apple sauce and white grapes), spicy (nutmeg, clove?).  It also has the wonderful, subtle but not so subtle combination of sour, tart, and acidity.  These subside a bit as the beer warms and combines to form a warm, lightly chocolately and nutty-like flavor.  I also pick up some faint ginger notes toward the finish as well as a really, really light nuttiness if I hold the beer in my mouth for a bit.  This beer has a medium body, yet it feels light and airy on the palate, and even soft and mellow.  Overall, this is another good Jolly Pumpkin brew, but it seems to be missing the complexity - no, thats not the right word - maybe uniqueness is what Im looking for - to really differentiate it from many of the other Jolly Pumpkin offerings...

This one is a gusher; the cap explodes off of the top and I swear at least a third of the 750 ends up all over my kitchen counter and in the sink. It just keeps bubbling up and out as a steady fountain until I pour most of it off into a couple of tulips. So...great big off-white head with what look like cinnamon flecks on top, glowing red-brown beautiful beer down underneath, some sediment. Lots of spice and chestnut in the aroma, amazing how strong the nuts come forward here, some musty notes, a whisp of sour. The flavor is heavily spiced but nonetheless beautiful: quite tart, again all of those chestnuts, mild funk, tannic, grape skins, leather, nutty sweetness, lots of spice. Mmmmm. Lovely.

963,"2008-03-30",4.0,"Poured a cloudy orange with a white creamy head and a bit of lace residue on the glass. Smells faintly skunky and lightly hoppy. As I have come to expect with Jolly Pumpkin, the taste is interesting; very much different than typical ales. The bottle mentions chestnut and ""spices""; further discription on the bottle lists the spices as ""distant forgotten spices,"" which wasnt much help as I couldnt quite place them. Regardless of my ability to recognize the spices, the blend was nicely balanced. Even the after taste was pleasant. The palate was as close to perfection as Ive ever encountered; perfect level of carbonation and the lingering impression of the taste was both long-lasting, and satisfying. A great ale well worth the purchase.

963,"2008-02-18",3.8,"750 mL, capped bottle from jrob_21 - thanks, Jonathan!  Probably the biggest gusher Ive ever had (and Im getting fed up with JP!) - would be surprised if I got more than 5 or 6 ounces out of the bottle.  Muddy, protein-filled ruddy-brown body, but still letting light through, head is lacing and a crystalline, pretty rocky beige, while it lasts.  Aroma is dominated by JPs brand of Belgian yeast, soft and slightly dusty with more caramel and candy than fruit...but a gentle blend, on the whole.  With time, some light gueuze-like acidity and slight lactose.  Taste is very yeasty and very dry, with a smooth Saison-ish spice.  Wild, untamed yeast; sligthly woody with no apples in sight.  No sign of alcohol, either - not even a light warming.  Medium-full body is smooth and has some classy Orval notes.  A really, really nice aftertaste, tart and dry and spicy.  Anger (and laughter) aside - though I think Im going to have to limit my JP consumption to the vat alone - this is an ale with a far more developed flavor profile than anyone would guess from the abv ... but also one that lacks distinction and seems has a slightly too-strong ""clone"" aspect.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Like a stinky old cheese covered in mold! The taste is a bit of a letdown after the beautiful nose, basically a tamed version of it. The brett is a surprisingly quiet for JP, while the malt flavors balance the spice out perfectly. Do I also sense a bit of hoppiness dancing with the acidic and tart nature of of the yeast? Hmm. Interesting! The aftertaste is very akin to that of mineral water, which kept me sipping for a long time. Not my favorite from JP, but still quite enjoyable.

EDIT!: I went downstairs to finish the second half of the bottle, and found that with the yeast added to the glass its a different monster altogether.

the finish starts with grape skins and ends with a medium bitterness with dry sour tartness that lingers thereafter, 
every sip brought a tingle to my nostrils, letting the ale warm up increased the tingle and I found this ale easily drinkable at room temperature,
I could not sense any alcohol in in aroma or taste, a nice gentle drinking ale.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

The head was creamy and off-white on the pour with good retention as it slowly collapsed into rocky peaks.  Decent lacing.  The aroma was the expected bretty funk at the onset, but as it opened up it showed great depth.  Beyond the sour funk there was soft caramel malt and nuttiness (chestnut).  A bit of old wood came through too.  The flavor was expectedly funky, but some hops and softer caramel came out too.  Crisp apple with a super dry finish.  Enjoyable.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"

Maybe a little wood or something in the aroma, but overwhelmingly sour, with not much else detectable.  Flavor is much more mild... a little bit sour (aroma is misleading), with a malty caramel flavor and a little bit of spicyness.

963,"2007-11-17",4.1,"750ml bottle.  The bottle is now green, unfortunately, unlike the old brown ones.  Batch 244,245.  Wonderful appearance on this one, just like Ive come to expect with this company.  A clear golden honey color with a huge rocky white head with great retention and great lacing.  Amazingly complex aroma on this baby.  Freshly roasted honey nuts, slight chocolate, brown sugar, christmas, normal JP funk, all integrated together and blended beautifully.  Chestnuts roasting over an open fire.  The nuttiness here is more appetizing than any other beer (mostly brown ales) where I have noticed a nutty character, it must be the chestnuts.  Taste is subdued in its funky and tart flavors with some of the nuttiness and chocolate of the aroma coming through but much, much more subtle.  This beer smells better than it tastes, unfortunately.  Probably the least sour and funky tasting JP Ive had to date, probably because its new.  Drinkability is very high.  Nice soft mouthfeel with a slight dryness.  Id be interested to see how this ages, though it is certainly nice right now.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Pour was a nice dark gold with a puffy 2 finger off white head that left quickly. Taste was nice and sour but the sourness didnt match up to the aroma. And somehow, after the swallow the sourness is gone...strange. Musty old spices and funkiness with a bit of wood and earth. Great all around beer.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
963,"2007-11-12",3.8,"On tap at La Cave Di Vun
This was my primary reason for making the trip to the Euclid area.  Once we found the place and spent ten minutes in awe of the selection it was time to settle down.  Looking at the tap list this seemed to be the best option to start.  It was good enough I almost purchased a bottle even at $18.  Perhaps if I can find it for less Ill stock some in the cellar.
Aroma / Appearance - The scent of a musty basement coupled with nutmeg and chestnut reminds me of a stale pumpkin beer minus the fruit.  Light cocoa sits well as does the wet barnyard aroma.  This has all the hallmarks of a typical Dexter release.  The body was hard to see in the dim light but appeared to be a cloudyd orange with thin white head.
Flavor / Palate - The funk is obvious from the start.  Once you adjust your palate the taste of oak, chestnut and some hoppiness stand out.  Almonds and spices eventually make an appearance towards the end.  This is very full bodied with a wheaty finish that lingers on the throat for seemingly forever.  It is the lightest drinking Jolly Pumpkin I have ever had as well.  It would have been very easy (and tempting) to drink this in ten minutes.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

963,"2007-10-27",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2007 Wow ... I got this as a cask pull at ""Buckeye Beer Engine"" in Lakewood, Ohio.  This was infinitely more interesting as it was around 55 degrees and the head was substantially different than anything I have had before.  It was like a soft whipped cream instead of the other Jollys that are effervescent and sticky.  The slightly hazy completion was nice and it was slightly more sour than their Bam.  High on my list, especially if you can get it off a cask pull.  Amended 11/3/07: had a taste of the regular draft today, very different texture.  More sour than the cask and significantly more effervescent.  Chestnut still present but more muted than the cask, probably a function of temperature.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","emerson430"
963,"2007-10-16",3.8,"Gusher warning!  This one blew like Old Faithful!  Once it settled, i poured a hazy, brownish red body with a massive, billowing, rocky, cream colored head.  The beer leaves behind huge clumps of thick foam that linger on the glass like cumulonimbus clouds over the Florida glades on a summer afternoon.  In short, the appearance is magnificent.  The aroma shows a complex bouquet of spiced apple cider, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet cherries, and traces of earthy cedar.  Right off the bat, you can tell that the signature JP funk is a bit more subdued in this one.  The flavor confirms this as moderately sour apple cider and caramel malts hit up front, while peppery spices and oak emerge on the back end.  The finish is bone dry and very woodsy, with oak and cedar both playing a part.  I didnt really pick up any nuttiness, as the commercial description would suggest.  Medium body.  Perhaps the smoothest and easiest to drink of the JP beers.  Fantastic aroma the disappoints a little in flavor.  Still, a very solid beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Inviting, pungent nose of funky spiced nuts and bread, along with some sour apple and honey, and some cedar and oak barrel.   Sourness is a bit lower than expected from the nose - lightly prickly on the tongue, somewhat acitic, but also very smooth, especially on the back, with some mellow, soft chestnut/acorn/walnut flavors, along with some banana bread and spiced cider.

The light funk is there along with a nuttiness and some fall spices.  The taste was pleasantly funky, dancing around on the palate and complimenting the spices.

963,"2007-09-15",4.1,"My first experience with a JP Artisian or Farmhouse style Ale. Took a little gettin used to, but as the glass and bottle was consumed this brew became increasingly more enjoyable.

Poured a slightly hazy pumpkin orange color. Created a thick and hefty, whipped cream-like head with superb retention. Lots of foam continued to emerge from the bottle after the initial pour into my chalice, so be prepared to keep your glass full! Thick sheets of lacing coated the glass as it drained. 

I found the initial aromas to be VERY funky at first. Like walking into a barn filled with dirt, mud, hay and a few horses and their saddle blankets. Other than that some pleasant notes of caramel malts, roasted chestnuts, green apples, lemon peel, fresh cut oak and spices greet the nose. An interesting array of smells to say the least. 

Loved the mouthfeel. Not overtly thick but full, round and creamy with a lively spritz.

Flavors were much like the aroma. Initially I picked up quite a bit of a funky sourness which almost made me wonder if the beer was infected. But as I continued on and the beer warmed luscious flavors of nuts, caramel, various spices, oak, earth and a touch of hoppy bitterness were enjoyed. 

Finishes with a pleasant tart hoppy/woody bitterness. If youre a fan of this style I would guess this is a real winner.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Aroma of lemon, brett, grapefruit rind up front with plenty of oak and funk.    Flavor had a bit more spicy pepper and I think I just burped up some fall leaves, though I could just be making it up.  Between the lemon and all of the funkiness this tends to be fairly tart, though not really that acidic.   Dry finish with a little vanilla poking through.  Overcarbonated, as most JP brews are, with a medium body.

Flavor is really unique caramel malts, almost a drier raspberry malt profile, with a nutty finish. Very drinkable, very smooth, its really quenching my thirst and went extremely well with steak & potatoes I know you could say that about water, pop, or any other crappy beer but no this was a showcase of how beer goes with food. Fruity but in a drier way where it has a slight sourness but not much. Again more fruits with apples, pears, raspberries, cherries, leading to a nutty biscuity finish and a dry fruity aftertaste. Really Im having a very hard time describing this beer its so freakin complex, its delicious, a summer thirst quencher, a beer with my meal, or just a dessert all on its own this beer rules. The carbonation is very big but really it helps highlight the complexities of this delight. The more it warms the fruits really come out and I think I like this beer colder. Some bitter fruitness barley-wine like is coming through and the fruits are getting sharper. What needs to be said is try this beer, it will open up your mind.

2007.  Cascading white gush on a firey orange murky body.  Thick apple tart and fritter sweetness in the aroma; warm cinnamon spiciness and earthy nuttiness.  Spices seem quite green sometimes; a cool, sweet wisp of tarragon.  Pickled ginger and citrus acids predominate a tart, juicy sweetness.  Flavor is a mite thin, showing a lot of grapefruit and mandarin tartness that seems to flutter a bit weakly on a brittle body of malt.  More prominent is this soft sweetness of oak and recurrent, dry-sweet greenish spiciness.  Pickled ginger rings out still and lends some funk to a soft sourness of white wine and overripe pear.  Full of delicacy and complexity, but notably less dense, less warming and less autumnal than last year.  Full sparkly palate, somewhat brisk and quite acidic.    Finishes on a soothing sweetness of vanilla and lemon meringue, musty and short.  Less memorable, if not necessarily worse.  Thanks Mike! 8/4/7/4/15 3.8","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Pours with the kind of head that makes me love beer anew. Seriously, this gives Houbblon Chouffe a run for its money.

963,"2007-01-22",3.9,"Lively pour yields a shadowy orange body with a large beige head; as per the usual with beers from J.P. it is steadfast and rocky. Lacing is thick and three dimensional. Aroma is butternut bread, vanilla, cinnamon, nectarine, musty yeast, oak barrel (less than usual, I think the spices keep it in check), sour cherries and blackberries, brown sugar and a nuttiness I must assume is chestnut. So much aromatic interplay and complexity here. Once again Ive encountered a phenomenal amount of easily identifiable, unique aromas in a Jolly Pumpkin beer. This bouquet does exactly what I think it was intended to do - invoke a feeling of Autumn and the peacefulness that it can bring when enjoying the lovely color and temperature changes in the climate that it is produced in. Well done. The flavor is quite tart, moreso than Id expected after many energetic whiffs. More tastes of fruit, brown sugar and bready malts. The cinnamon and other spices are profound in their subjugation of my tastebuds. Intense doesnt begin to describe it. I preferred the aroma to the taste due to the intensity, perhaps I shouldve let it rest a while longer. Palate is medium to full but without balance. Soft mouthfeel. Finishes with a heady amount of oaken barrel and spiciness. A really interesting and individual beverage, with some characteristics I had only previously associated with exotic teas. Intriguing, enigmatic. At times I felt overwhelmed by such bold flavor. Then I realized it is just a challenging beer, so I must take more jabs at it. Ron, you rule.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

963,"2006-10-12",4.2,"25 oz bottle, via Styles, shared at Kennett Square Brewfest after-party 2006.  Pours a slightly cloudy dark copper colored body under a slightly fizzy white head that faded to a thin film.  Great delicate lacing lined the glass beautifully.  Aroma is lightly tart with some soft malt and light belgian yeast.  Fairly pronounced brett in the aroma with spices, woodiness, and almost a dried leaf earthy smell.  Not sure what the chestnuts are doing for the aroma, but there are some unusual hints buried in there.  The flavor is quite tart and drying, but not as crazy as I was expecting.  Minimal soft remnants of caramel malt are there, but hiding well.  The brett comes out nicely on the finish with plenty of oak tannins and an almost aged hop flavor.  Again, not sure about the chestnuts, but there is a nice earthy, bordering on almond, flavor mid swallow that may be due to them.  Otherwise, some spices and light yeast as well.  Mouthfeel is classic JP with lots of lively fizzy efforvescent carbonation.  Not quite as foamy as some other JPs Ive had though.  Overall, this was my favorite JP thus far.  Not as crazy and funky as I was expecting, this was more about subtle nuances than the in your face sourness from some of their other offerings.  I need more.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
963,"2006-10-10",4.6,"Bottle from Steve (punkrkr27) Thanks!  Man, I have wanted to get a hold of this beer for the longest time, and it is worth the wait in every aspect.  Pours out a reddish yellow color with a pretty thick white head.  Smell is oak, sour flavors, yeast, fruits, and some nuts.  Taste is smooth and rich, but also kind of sour to give it a nice little punch.  Hops are not present at all.  Very smooth and an awesome beer that should be brewed year round.  This is their best beer I have gotten to try thus far.  The only problem is my glass disappeared too quickly.  Great stuff.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

963,"2006-09-16",3.9,"A sweet glow of tawny lemons and horsey grain husk. Grapeskins and fermenting leather blend in a sack of spice. A sweet peach soda pour, with a flowing lace of ivory. Flavor is a sweet sugary essence of malt, while Brett plays quietly in the corner. This beer isnt as nuanced as I would expect. I breathe in some vapors of extraneous nut husks and distant spice conjuring. The reduced play of Brett is deft, as I still get the wonderful sweet lechee juice sensation, but am sparing the scorching acidity. I can also pleasently draw on the crisp malt sugars. This beer isnt particularly nuanced in my opinion, but has a beavenly drinkability, replete with fresh crisp summer hops. The quietly unassuming, but magically appearing hop smack on the tounge, in Euro fashion makes this an expertly balanced beer. This beer is really growing on me, the long drawn carries fresh lime juice and Madagascar Vanilla. And theres spicy mingling. It turns into one of those beers you want to just keep drinking and drinking and hope it will never go away. This is a scarce beer where the backend and smack are the best parts.

963,"2006-08-17",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2007 Bottle drunk on 8/12/06.The usual light gushing and huge amount of foamy, well-aerated head is produced here, with a thick layer of sediment left on the bottom.  The head is a light-cornmeal color while the body is a deep copper-tangerine-peach, with gold-leaf highlights and some darker auburns.  Medium-high to high clarity from leaving the sediment behind.  Unlike some other JPs, however, the head is not as long-lasted, fading rather steadily to barely cover the liquid, with some blotchy lacing left behind.Brett strikes forth in the nose, fruity and phenolic, with a light dose of nuttiness (wood tannins), some specks of cinnamon and brown sugar and then a fade-to-lacto, with a hard, sour, yogurt-like note.  Quite strong in the nose, and the brett seems in peak/near-peak form, giving off hints of pear skins, limes, lemons and such.  The malt is a little bit more difficult to discern, obviously being nearly all-attenuated, but certainly a softness of caramel residue, light vanilla cream notes and honey.  Not overly spicy in the nose, nor would I ever pick out the chestnut, but there is an added zestiness.  Wood character is very subdued in the nose.  It all comes together very uniquely, nothing being too dominant, though aside from the wild yeasts, I think, perhaps, its a bit too reserved?  No alcohol is apparent in the aroma.The first sip is, again, unique for a Jolly Pumpkin beer.  A fuzzy, aerated, rather large-bubbled carbonation immediately loosens things, providing more vacuousness than usual for these beers.  Brett mixes with dry, tannic oak and is quickly supported by soft fruits (cherries, apricots, pears, peaches, nectarines) and further pale sugars.  Lactobacillus influence is very light in this one, without nearly as much hard edge to the finish as many.  Probably that this is still relatively young contributes to that factor.  Whatever the reason, its quite drinkable, with the usual heavy brett and wood dryness offset by the light, but noticeable residual sugars.  Some mildly herbal, somewhat leafy hops are noted, and the spices are extremely light.  The mouthfeel had some problems, going from heavily carbonated (though not aggressively so) to quite undercarbonated, without much transition between the two.  Still, with the low abv, and medium colored malts and a decided softness not found in many JP beers, I found it extraordinarily drinkable, much moreso than the bottle I had fresh (which was too sweet).  Probably wouldnt want to let this one sit too much longer, unless you enjoy tons of lacto character.Rerate on 2/3/07Still as good as I remember, no problems in the aging thus far.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

963,"2006-07-31",3.9,"Poured a fitting scarlet fire color with a healthy white head.  The aroma and body were both really delicate, something Im learning to appreciate with JP beers.  This really smelled like Xmas when first poured - noting warm cinnamon and bread.  The warmth was balanced with a nice, subtle lactic tartness, which added a nice complexity.  I thought the mouthfeel was a bit prickly, interrupting the flow a bit.  The body is sublte as well, noting light biscuit malts, with hints of caramel and cookie dough (snickerdoodle?).  More tartness appears in the finish and balances the sweetness.  As the beer warms, a strong vanilla and oak note come out as well.  Very good and would be even better with a more soft carbonation.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

A subtle underlayer of allspice seasoned honey adds another sweeter dimension for my olfactory enjoyment.  Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel with a soft pinch of dry vermouth tartness.

The beer is a moderately hazed deep amber concoction which upon pouring froms a solid and fairly dense light tan head that just wont go away.  Dense, foamy lacing is left behind.  Soft funk aroma, nothing too assertive that just whacks you in the face but a subtle barny presence that introduces itself and slides away into the crowd.  Perhaps a touch of the chestnuts, hard to say never having had a chestnut beer before.  Medium bodied, a bit sprightly on the palate and moderately drying.

Evident brettanomyces meet the nostrils through well disposed woodiness reminiscent of cedar and Christmas tree. Complex flavour profile shows an interplay between the incredibly well integrated chestnuts and the wild, fitting sourness, the whole completed by various notes of cloves, cream, meringue and a number of fruits. Surprisingly dry in mouth, it is highly fruity and at the same time yogurty in its lactic aspects. Very pleasant biscuity backbone serves as a foundation for litchi, grapes, nut, wood berries and mild leafy hops. Gentle foamy palate, medium-full bodied.

963,"2006-04-03",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2011 Any first impressions?
-A creamy head settles over the muddy dusk.
-Orangey citrus fruit and accompanying herbal spices, comforted by a nutty sweetness, lie on classy wooden flooring.
-Chestnuts obviously provide most of the beers sweetness, emboldened by an otherwise meditative spicy flavoring.
-The carbonation is ample but delicate, exactly how these Belgian ales should be carbonated.

What if you dig deeper?
-The fruity, nutty sweetness isnt overdone, agreeing with the subtle, intelligent tartness.
-The wooden dryness softly drops the curtain.
-All in all, this is a quite humble spectrum of flavors.

More complex than the taste, which is quite dry, spicey. Fruity, with again much citrus, but without any fruitsugars. Theres a retronasal sourness, wry, like crabapples and/or orangezest, slowly dissipating in the throat. This gets more marked warming up. Despite the dryness, theres a fizzy MF present. Not very much body either. Compared to my only other JPAA, this is where Fuego dOtoño slightly lacks. Then again, the beer is extremely drinkable.

Creamy carbonation softly expands on the palate. Juicy passionfruit and mandarin oranges erupt alongside an herbal sharpness intertwined with artfully restrained brett tartness. Light dose of nutty sweetness slowly emerges to continually brighten the prominent fruitiness while the doughy yeast coats the tongue and buoys the body. Juicy as all get-out, although the brett lends a pleasant scratchiness, which is quite nice. Trace levels of black pepper-dusted honeydew and peach fuzz bitterness. Theres an abundance of ester-derived spiciness, but the spices which were apparently added go unnoticed. Finishes increasingly spicy, irony, and malty sweet, with a phenolic and musty brett flourish.  Woodsy dryness leaves behind a clean powdery residue which resides elegantly with the floral hop aftertaste. Another very good beer from Jolly Pumpkin.

963,"2006-02-14",3.1,"750ml bottle thanks to Styles  Medium carbonated, pours with a small amount of fizz to a murky, opaque medium-dark amber with some brown hints.  The small head is light beige, with large bubbles giving it a rocky appearance; it does not last long.  Mild caramel, tart grape stems, a smell exactly like grape seeds taste, lightly tart fruit, a bit of unripened blueberry, light mint, orange spice(similar to celestial seasonings manderin orange spice tea), allspice, a hint of strawberry/raspberry syrup, a bit of pumpkin pie spice, showing just a bit of horseblanket, mild barnyard, and something thats almost like sour melon or rotting fruit.  Much like the aroma, the taste is quite complex.  It begins with with a very mild acidic tart shock, but nowhere near the strength of any lambic.  This flows into a lightly tart fruit, and complex spice medley (allspice, melon rind, bitter orange zest, alligator pepper, what I take to be chestnut, and something similar to bog myrtle but it could be the chestnuts - Ive never had chestnuts in beer before).  Some sweet caramel malt shows through in brief flashes towards the middle along with some tannic wood notes.  Finishes very bitter, you can actually feel the dry bitterness in your mouth and the back of the throat, with  notes of earthy nut, lemon grass & caramel along with something akin to the outside flesh of a walnut(if you ever tried biting one of these you know exactly what Im talking about).  Medium carbonated, medium bodied though feeling pretty light on the palate without much texture.  Overall one of the more complex beers Ive tasted in aroma and taste which certainly makes it fun to try to pick out all the flavors.  Ultimately the flavors are mostly confusing and do not blend very well into a coherant beer.  In addition, the acidity is very well balanced but the beer is much too bitter (Im assuming this comes from the chestnuts?), which makes it difficult to drink.  This is well worth a try to exercise your palate and I have a feeling this may become great after a few years in the bottle.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

963,"2006-02-12",4.4,"This beer is pretty well carbonated, it pours with a frothy three-finger thick tan head, that starts to leave a lacing pattern as it slowly, and falls back in a cratered rocky fashion.  The beer is a hazy reddish-tinged amber color.  The aroma is intoxicating, it is immediate as soon as I start pouring this beer; it is a mix of tart notes and fruit up front.  As I go in for a deeper draught of the aroma I get a signature of Brett that is a bit horseblanket, and quite funky (especially if you linger over the aroma.  The tartness is still here underneath the Brett character; notes of tamarind and tart plum are quite evident.  The aroma is quite complex, and quite nice I could smell these beers for quite some time.  Comparable to a Lambic in many ways but there is that balancing sweet note, which contributes to the fruitiness, and is not typically found in a bone dry Lambic.  After a bit of time I start to pick up a fruity concentrated note that reminds me of sweet strawberries and kiwis; Interesting.

The beer has some body to it, and an astringent woody/ tannic note that definitely make one think of the barrels that this was fermented in (or perhaps some of it is from the chestnuts).  It only has a light sweetness to it, but it is enough to play up fruity notes of apples and plums.  The beer is spicy with a nice carbonation note in combination with some spicy oak notes and sharp acidity.  It is notable that the acidity is almost subtle here, I am not saying that it is not here, because it is definitely tart, but it is so well integrated with the rest of the flavors.  The spices that were used are also quite subtle, in fact I can’t even pick any of them out, which in my mind is about perfect, I like the integrated character that spices add, but don’t like them to be individually noticeable.  The Brettanomyces is here in the flavor, but not nearly as noticeable as it was in the aroma.  This really works for this beer, because the Brett does not dominate the flavor profile; it contributes an underlying funkiness that sort of wraps around and accentuates the other characteristics found in this beer.  As time goes on this beer picks up a wonderful creaminess to it, which really brings the mouthfeel to another level.

My final word on this beer is that it is so well integrated, and so well balanced.  The wood character, the tartness, the funky notes, the fruit character and everything else just combines to form a really nice drinking, complex brew.  Once again Ron has created a masterful brew, so far he is firing on all cylinders and I still have 5 more of these to go.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
963,"2006-01-31",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2008 01.31.06  750ml bottle thanks to Schroppfy.  The beer as it rests in the tulip globe glows as a November sunrise, blazing, fiery, and a smoky haze.  The head is lasting, creamy, the color of Mantoloking sand.  Aromas greet the observer without prodding as wafting but attenuated waves of succulent floral, misty woodlands, toasted sage, and dried citrus potpourri come quickly forward.  The palate is delighted with this perfect snapshot of the season and I am struck with glee.  Flavors and aromas meld to bring a sense of a damp oak forest in autumn - a mossy streamside with rotting leaves, mineral rich soil, and musty, buttery chestnuts gathered in a wicker basket.  More savory spice emerges with time and temperature as a revelation of corriander and spicy yeast notes comes to the fore.  A pleasant mix of tart fruits (grape), mild astringency (apple, floral), miniscule but necessary sourness, and perfume throughout.  I would wish only for a somewhat firmer body, less smooth and perhaps more astringent.  If Orval brewed an autumn beer, it might just be this.  Excellent.  20070303  vertical with 05 and 06 versions.  The 05 had great development, melding of hops and brett.  Finish has smoothed out.  The 06 was bright, hoppy, and fun.  Of the group, I was the only one who preferred the younger.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
963,"2006-01-25",4.3,"Big gracious thanks to schroppfy for the bottle. Ron Jeffries is doing wonderful things up there in the cozy town of Dexter, MI and this autumn seasonal is another testament to that fact. It looks fantabulous in the glass. Lightly murky amber with a lovely stark white head that leaves a great wake of lace as it descends the glass. The nose is funky, spicy fruit up front. As it opens up I get more barnyard and ripe fruits (apricot and chestnut). The flavor exhibits wood and some tannins but the meshing of funk and spice is the standout here. The palate is dry, prickly and fully attentuated. The chestnuts come in after the swallow and waft through my sinuses as an earthy nuttiness. Damn good stuff.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
963,"2006-01-22",3.8,"Sampled at the Milwaukee YEHa!05 courtesy of Silphium:  Pours a transparent copper orange color with a thin lightly-lacing white head.  Rich, complex Belgian yeasty and oaky, earthy aroma has a touch of floral character.  Body starts lightly sweet, balanced with a touch of toasty caramel and oaky tartness toward a slightly thinner, smooth finish.  Very authentic and well-brewed.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
963,"2006-01-20",4.7,"Another beer in which my review serves no justice. Muddy orange with huge white head, tiny bubble carbonation. Head gently fades to creamy film. Great lacing. Great sour/tart character in the nose. Mostly orange and cherry. Some floral notes with yeasty/musty farmhouse funk. Initial flavor very sweet, buttery caramel/chestnut combination. Turns to floral flavors and lambic/brett like sourness, with lots of orange zest. Maybe JP/Rons barrels have bacteria setting in now? I love it!!! Finishes sweet, sour and somewhat dry. Dont really get much spice unless its cardomom? maybe paradise? Great mouthfeel, starts lively and finishes creamy. Quickly becoming my daily drinker.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
963,"2006-01-10",3.2,"Appearance is really nice looking.  Hazy deep amber with a fairly large white head of tiny bubbles.  Aroma is yeasty, with tart notes of cherry.  Flavor is predominantly tart, more fruity cherry flavors, followed by the chestnut and grain flavors that save the flavor from being too sour.  Some notes of oak and spice.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, with a moderately bitter, spiced finish.  I didn;t really like this at first because of the unexpected tartness, but it grew on me towards the end.  A decent brew, but not really my thing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","BobbyW3363"
963,"2006-01-07",3.1,"from the bottle at Styles place.  Light amber color with a fluffy white head.  The nose has orange and wood and a hint of the sour twinge that makes my sour beer warning hairs stand on end.  As it warms, it gets more and more funky.    Lots of fruity peach, orange, and sour apple notes, with what Ive come to associate with the ""horseblanket"" muskyness of some Belgians.  Noticable wood in the flavor profile.  Not an unapproachable beer, but still not something that the average beer palate will enjoy.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

963,"2006-01-04",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2006 750 mL bottle.  somewhat tart aroma floats above a sponge-cake-like head, and some fruit and spice shine through as well.  no chestnut in the aroma, but there is definitely a nutty/woody flavor hidden behind the cinnamon and clove and yeast flavors which dominate.  only 6.1%?  its nice and sticky and warming - easily my favorite jolly pumpkin beer so far.  cheers to this new brewery!","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"

The nose has a yeasty and wheaty character with a noticeable cherry and apricot twang and some of those chestnut aromas are there as well. The flavor starts tart, funky, and fruity with a nice grain background. It developed a woody and earthy undertone before a light spice (Grains of Paradise, clove ?) and bitter finish.

963,"2005-12-19",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2006 Sampled December 2005, with a follow-up session with tpkenned  (where we had a whole bottle to ourselves) in January 2006.Mostly translucent with a mild orange-copper color.  Some miniscule bubbles form a bigger-picture, thick wrung around the sides of the tulip to serve as the head.  Aroma, as always, is so fin good.  Sage, freesia, lemon husks and hints of hazelnuts sitting in chardonnay.  Curacao and orange peel add extra dimension as a sweet, souring current courses through the nose and bridges its way into the mouth.  Turning green grape skin graced with cinnamon imbeds a souring, near-tannic personality that livens with admirable effervescence.  Articulated dance of caramel dipped Granny Smith apples help to embody the perfectly balanced sweet & sour relationship that provides an over-arching theme throughout the entire experience.  Slight husk array with coriander scratch and a subtle, sullen hop regime to bring it back to its flawless artesian roots.  Additional accents of pinot and sauvignon grapes and a dusty hazelnut crust are most prevalent in the finish, joined soon thereafter by orange rind scrapings (neglected for weeks) and subtle, subconscious turning pistachios.  Such a flawless execution of all the appropriate souring dimensions along with seductive sweetening that consistently balances the brett-like nature from going overboard.  Sheer delight.  Another daunting, world class creation.  Few things can render me breathless and speechless.  The majority of such feats stem from Dexter, Michigan.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
963,"2005-12-18",3.9,"Aroma of major funk, like manure but in a good way. Lots of malty, spiciness and some celery mixed in with that bretty funk.  Golden brown with a thin white head.

963,"2005-12-17",4.2,"Brad brought this!  Thanks a million!  This beer pours to a deeply hazy copper body with an off-white head.  The aroma is cedary and spicy.  Caramel and white grapes.  Very distinct and unique.  Smells devine!  The flavor is tangy and peppery.  Gingerbread?  Cedared pears.  Delicious.  I love Jolly Pumpkin.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
963,"2005-12-10",3.7,"Murky orange-brown body, medium off-white head.  Fruity, spicy aroma- apples, pears, white grape, caramel, and pepper.  Definitely tangy, sour, and woody, but punctuated by the bitter spicing.  The flavor, interestingly, takes a 90-degree turn, with a very subdued sweetness rather than the syrupy sugars the aroma portended.  Bready and lightly caramely, with rather strong spices (pepper and something else, but Im not sure what), finishing with perfume/flower petals.  Nutty, but is it the power of suggestion?  The tangy tannins do display in the finish after a few sips, leaving a nice bite on the tongue.  A few sips later, Im picking up chestnut ""meat"" more strongly.  Interesting.  I think its about time to taste all of JPs beers side-by-side.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

 Rating #880
It truly pours a chestnut hued body and a most handsome rocky khaki colored head. From the first quaff, I found an amazing blend of wild yeasts and busty caramel and toffee malts. The wild yeasts are most predominant on my palate; coming across in a particularly vinous manner. Im noting a wildly tannic and mildly acidic blending of young cabernet grapes and a more mature fruity zinfandel. Rather oaky and peppery upfront and vaguely fruity in the middle, a combination of green and red apple cider. 

The brett and untamied lacto flavors remind me of a soft Maytag blue folded up into some fresh crusty skinned pumpernickel bread. The wild yeasts are the life of the beer for me; Im having a hard time seeing past them. I dutiabley find the plethora of nutty malts, some cracked wheat, and sourdough breads. The palate is tremendous, a perfectly balanced weight. There is a yeasty tartness of cumquat and dough lingering with oak chips and Melba-toast in the finish. This is a wonderful beer for all occasions a bottled triumph of liquid and art. -  A new all time favorite!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
963,"2005-12-02",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2007 Update: Nov 15th, 2007. New bottle, green glass. Still a very good beer, but more lactic with each passing run (this is Batch 3 of this beer...). Huge drop from 4.7 to 3.9 overall.  Feb 4, 2006:    In the clear pour, the aroma and the color and the conditioning of this beer are just perfect. In the aroma, earthy herbalness and mushroom and spices, especially nutmeg and carrot tops. In the flavor, the tiniest bit of caramel sweetness pulls throught the rush of swirly lemon and pepper and bark. Wow!...Jan 17, 2006:    Slight update yet again: The appearance of this beer, from the slightly islanded blobs of head to the GORGEOUS luminescent amber, is totally inviting. Lactic sourness and peach galore!  Rerate after second bottle: The flavor score must go up here - delicious and very nutty...DEC 2, 2005:    Original: Well, what do chestnuts, and an awful lot of them (10% of the mash weight), taste like? Tastes like a Biere de Mars, really; some tingly iron and earthy flavors, only very slightly nutty (kind of like wet fermented walnut meat to me) but very lush and spicy as well. The spices seem peppery, and similar to new Luciernaga. A little sour from Lactobaccillus. Tannic and oaky. Spicy nose, pencil shavings, maybe a bit of coriander, maybe grains of paradise as in the Luciernaga. Dark gold bordering on ruddy, with a spectacular carbonation level - really sparkly, living and fresh. Quite good. I aint getting no caramel, no real sweetness, but some breadiness...","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
