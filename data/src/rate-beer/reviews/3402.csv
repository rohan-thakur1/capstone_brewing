3402,"2017-03-22",4.0,"Bottle, vintage 2008. Pours a clear dark brown beer with a quickly disappearing off white head on top. Aroma is rich, full with woody characters, red fruits, oak, some tart fruits and has vineous notes as well. Flavor is incredibly full, yet really sublte with light tarty notes, richness of red fruits, all sorts of berries and such. Has a body that is light tart and vineous, overall is quite fruity and almost sweetish. Mouthfeel is oily and silky, has a dry tart aftertaste that really lasts a long time. No carbonation going on, but what a great beer.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","MrHangover"

Its like a sour/acetic quadrupel or something like that. Medium body, slightly syrupy, just a bit of carbonation.

3402,"2015-10-14",2.1,"Bottle from JefVerstraete, thanks! Surprisingly malty nose, like pumpernikel with bread, vanilla and brown sugar. Also alcoholic. In contrast, due to the slightly vinegar-like acidity, the body does not come across as solid. The carbonation is almost none, while the coffee-infused finish is also alcoholic. This is a very strange flanders red, not really fruity while still decidedly vinous, in part reminiscent of home made wine with added sugar (hence the easily discernable boozy notes).

3402,"2015-05-01",4.5,"Drunk from a Reidal Vinum glass.

in the bottle there is a relatively intense brown sugary quality with just a whiff of the ol sour. Headless in the glass though there are swirling flat one dimensional lacing dots on the surface which creates delicate swirling patterns. Dark chestnut brown with some red rusty highlights. Considering it has no head it looks pretty inviting.
There is a slight vinuous quality and more intense brown sugary sweetness along with cherries surrounded by a golden hue. Some overly ripe apple in there too.
No carbonation but smooth sleek and caressing in the mouth with some fine wafer like instensity on the way down. Much elegance for an 8% ABV beer. Beautifully molded together to form a seemless whole.
the nose from the final drops just goes on and on and on and on and on.

The beer is dark mahogany and pretty clear with a broke tan head. Aromas of oak, cherry, funk, vanilla, prune.

3402,"2014-07-13",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2017 An innovative twist on the oud bruin genre, which normally is not spiced, but this one apparently is. Yellow tanned, thin and quickly dissipating head, colour deeply mahogany brown; complex and powerful aroma of raisins, oak, milk chocolate, passion fruit, coffee grounds, candied dates, medium dry sherry, hazelnuts, sour cream, wine vinegar; taste is deliciously complex, exotic fruits, spicy accents, supple and deep malt basis, the sweetishness of which is balanced against the lactic acidity very cleverly. This is truly an addition to the age-old genre of oud bruin and one of the most interesting beers Ive had from this exciting brewery.

The taste is great with a definite blend of dark bitter cherry and black currants and a mild pinot noir finish, similar to the smell but this actually blend together well. The mouthfeel is mediocre as the beer had almost no carbonation but has a bitter, dry mouthfeel.

3402,"2013-07-26",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2015 Pours with no head. Before I even have time to observe the colors, a sharp acetic note has already wafted to my nose. Color of rich black earth mud, but not cloudy at all. Looks like very strong iced black tea. Aroma is of spiced bread (heavier on the spice than the bread): clove and nutmeg, sweet tea, vinegar, tart grape and cherry. No carbonation on palate. Flavor is quite tart, high in acetic acid to the point of excess. Caramel malt. Acetic is zesty, dominant. Just when I though tit was going to be a detriment, the spices kick in and round out these sharp notes: nutmeg, cinnamon, light licorice and clove, hint of black pepper. Grape juice (made from wine grapes). Light, dry, old, nutty woodiness. As it warms and breaths, I adapted to the acetic zest and thought a bit more highly of the beer. Some elements are great: spice, fruit, and intensity of flavor, while the lack of carbonation makes the beer less enjoyable.

She also said that you can taste something new for the first ten sips, every time. Sadly, I cannot confirm this, but this was still very enjoyable. Taste is both sour and sweet, somehow reminds me of sweet soy sauce (the color isnt far from that either). Not the kind of sourness you would find in a gueuze, as this heavily offset by sweetness.

3.0 A: Pours a completely still brownish black color.

2.0 S: Reeks of balsalmic vinegar and tart cherries. Deeply acetic and powerful. Moderate acetone and mild soy sauce. Molasses and a good bit of vinousness. The more you smell it, the more it grows on you. Im not sure if I love it or hate it, but I could do without the acetone.

2.5 T: The taste is just as forceful as the nose. This starts out with a marriage between the balsalmic vinegar and the acetone. Cherries follow next. Tobacco and soy sauce after that. Molasses, vinous grape, and a bit of oak. 

2.0 M: Medium body. Almost no carbonation. Almost slick. Cant say this is very smooth.

2.5 D: This is wholely unrefined. Im okay with the sourness and the balsalmic flavors. Hell, sometimes Ill pour a quarter ounce of balsalmic vinegar into a snifter just to sip on. But, the acetone is really offputting. I guess a few too many bug species got in there. This would be a lot better if a few things were different, but such it is as it is. Super complex and powerful, but just not that good.

Poured from a height (10cm) into a large Duvel glass.

Low carbonation.
Colour very dark brown, darker than I expected.
Acidic brett, vinegar, oak, spices, raisins, alcohol and what seems like candi sugar in the nose.
Taste quickly goes from gently sour to full on soy sauce and  sour flavours mixed with what tastes to me like blackened treacle. Then fades to a lovely sour finish on the tongue, tempered with that soy sauce again. Wow.
I kind of get sweet, sour, bitter AND umami (living in Japan, after all!) all in one here. Interesting beer. Like the first impression and the lingering sour finish on the tongue but that kick just after you taste it is something else. Not so sure Im loving that! VERY tart and sour. Bitter, too.

Tasting notes: Poured vigorously to get a big bubbled head on top of the dark colored beer. The head evolves into a ring of bubbles with some clouds in the middle. The nose is complex, notes of vinegar, fresh sour apples, lots of oak. The flavor starts very smooth and when you swallow it you get a powerfull but gentle acetic burn which reminds me of the Earthmonk Ive tasted directly from the cask and I liked very much. Afterwards you get a complex aftertaste with notes of sour apples, oak, vinous touches, .. . Too complex to be accurately described, so Ill definitely enjoy degustating this beer some more times. The carbonisation is very flat but this just adds a special feeling to this beer.

Pours a dark brown color with some reddish-mahogany highlights. A few light tan bubbles to start and then it falls completely flat, which is then echoed in the flavor and feel. The nose brings a bit of light soy sauce and mild sweetness, which, oddly enough, reminds me a bit of 2009 Dark Lord. Slight cherry cherry along with lactic acid and a bit of vinegar. The flavor goes straight from the nose bringing through cherry, soy sauce, vinegar, and some very mild sweetness. Light body with very low carbonation and a pretty heavy acetic acid presence.

A second into another glass from a bit of height gives me a bigger slick of brown foam but that fades out as well.  Aroma is a funky combination of off-sour, caramelized sugar, musty oak, leather, soft raisin, and a tinge of tart fruit that I cannot quick identify.  Wow - very odd but enjoyable taste and much better than the aroma predicts.  Taste is a chewy, wine-like sour with sweet and tart fruit notes (cherry?).

Initial is decent touch of vinegar, red wine, sour cherries, more gentle with a vinegar kick. Sour cherries are more gentle, inviting with some bready malts, toast, lactic acid. Touches of oak, sweeter malts. Into the finish is lingering cherry tannins, wet oak, sweeter malts, toast, sour fruits. Gentle, the sourness doesnt assert itself. Solid, but not world moving.

3402,"2011-05-26",4.4,"A very, very opaque brown color. I cannot see light through it, and it is still a bit turbid. I do get hints of light at the small of the glass and the top edges. There is a faint red tint to it. Flat, still pour. No head, even when forcing it. A very pungent acetobacter (vinegar) aroma. Very strong. There is a big malty aroma under this as well. Much like a big barleywine that may have gone bad from oxygen exposure. In this case it was intentional though. Leaves a caramel tint on the glass after taking a sip and the liquid falls back to its temporary residence. Some points it smells like a quad with barely any sourness, but that may be the vinegar smell saturating my senses until I clear them.

The taste is a very mixed bag of flavors. I get the sweet malt up front. Much like a quad in this regard. Then the sourness hits me. It isnt overpowering like the smell would lead one to believe. It is subtle but in your face. An oxymoron of a presence. There is also a big alcohol presence in both taste and mouth feel. A slight bitterness makes its way into the mouth as well. Its not the sour, its something else. Maybe some hops, as I get a bit of a vegetal taste also. But fairly subdued. A very earthy taste as well. Could be from the barrel, as is most of the oxygen characters Im picking up. Im digging it. Its very complex. Like a sherry, but maltier. Fruity and sour, with sweetness mixed in. There is a burning in the throat after each swallow that is a combination of the vinegar and alcohol notes. Not over the top.

Very little carbonation at first, but then a super thin layer of bubbles forms and lasts for several minutes.

This mixed good and bad.  It has nice medium sourness for the style, which I appreciated, and the nose catches glimpses of funk, vineous fruit, and a slightly spicy note to go with somewhat rich malt sweetness.

The aroma is actually very nondescript with notes of fruit, sourness, oak, and some mild acetone. The taste is much better than the nose with a very robust flavor profile. Some mineral type earth notes in the taste as well. Some acetone present as is some sour/tart cherries. Not as fruitful or sweet as other sours/wilds that I have had. I think I get a touch of leather as well. Overall, I really like this beer for its authenticity and complexity. Far from being the best in this class but a good beer nonetheless.

Pours dark mahogany in the glass but shows through a deep, deep copper when held up to the light.  There is almost no head at all, just some big beige bubbles that float around to the edges and leave a paper-thin colllar.

The aroma is initially sweet with brown sugar and tart fruits mixed together.  Also some oak, grapes, raisins, hints of funk and a hefty dose of vinegar as well.

The taste is still sweet but has more tart cherries mixed in.  Its much more earthy than the aroma with a heavy dank barnyard presence.  Its not crazy funky, just earthy, if that makes sense.  The finish is fruity but dry, very much like a red wine actually.

The mouthfeel is slick with almost no carbonation, again, like red wine.  Its medium bodied overall but comes across thin due to the lack of carbonation.

Mouthfeel: Terribly flat and a major disappointment. This is what kills the whole beer for me. Dramatically undercarbonated. If this bottle had been aged for 5 years and tasted this way, Id call it a cellaring success. But this is a letdown fresh.

Drinkability: Flat beer aint very drinkabile for me unless the base flavors are excellent. in the case of earthmonk, they are.

Wow I feel ripped off. The flavors are great, but the lack of carbonation undermines everything. I wouldnt be happy with this purchase if it cost $6.00 per bottle, let alone $15.00

The aroma has dark berries, a lot of oak, vanilla, very delicious sweetness in the nose, dried fruits, small sourness, brown sugar, maybe a bit spice. The taste has a lot of sweetness, oak, vanilla, sourness, dried dark fruits, ripe apricot, a limey bite and small notes of spices, cinnamon, clove.
Medium bodied, almost flat texture, sweet and sour after taste. A very good sour. Re-rate: draught at Mikkeller Bar. The sample I had here just had lots of balsamic vinegary qualities, red wine, brett, leather and sweet and sour berries, everything just perfectly balanced. The taste had the same components, again strikingly well balanced all over. A very exceptional beer. I think this was the 2006 vintage. Had to nutch it from 4.2 to 4.3

It pours nearly black but really a deep oud bruin clear color with a very little carbonation but some tan bubbles stick around the rim of the glass. The aroma is not tart or vinegary or sour. Rather it is vanilla, oak, cognac, tannins, peat, bourbon, chocolate mousse, something like German chocolate cake. In the flavor there is buttery bourbon and ganache then a sharp tartness/sourness creeps up in the end but it is not a lambic/geuze/wild ale tartness but a very subtle bourbon barrel aged flemish sour tartness if one existed with a subtle port wine character. It really is massively fantastic. Very rich creamy/buttery palate. Velvety smooth. Really just adds a new deminsion to what flemish sour can accomplish. I am sort of speechless. This is my favorite beer. Period. 2/6/2010 10/4/9/5/18=4.6330mL red top 2007 ed Japan export version thanks to Urbain and Carlo for my Christmas present! I will now explain to you how to experience my favorite beer in the world:Step 1: Pour half the bottle in a raster tulip or snifter from a liberal height to induce a small, thick, tan head. Spotty lace will develop.Step 2: Take in the first aroma. For this batch I smell lots of cream of balsamic, raspberries, and acetic sourness like New Belgium La Folie.Step 3: Let this sit still and warm up to near room temperature. Now the nose really explodes out of the glass with no effort: big red wine vinous notes, spicy oak, cinnamon, cloves, black cherries, bakers chocolate.Step 4: Take your first sip by indulging in about half as much as a normal gulp of beer, swish it around in your mouth quickly and then swallow. Here you will discover a superlative palate of oily ganache, dark chocolate, spicy oak, melted cherries. It is like a sour version of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. So many rich, imperial stout-like flavors explode. Then the finish is fresh and zippy.Step 5: Let it warm up to around 70 degrees or more and now see how the aroma has changed. Now we have German chocolate cake, coconut, chocolate mousse, chocolate covered raspberries, butter, spicy/tawny port wine reduction, peppery Shiraz grapes, muted alcohol. The palate at this stage is a 10 on a 5 point scale. There is slight sharp acid, then spice, and then full fledged chocolate cake and buttery mousse. But there is something else like cranberry sorbet and even Frangelico liquor. There is just the slightest amount of soap that comes through but youd really have to be looking for it. The finish is long, quenching, and mouth-watering. Theres almost no way this could be any better. Actually, the only way this could be any better is if it somehow came in the form of a French, dark chocolate true truffle- the kind that melt into a puddle if they sit in your hand for too long. 10/4/10/5/18=4.7","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

3402,"2009-09-30",3.7,"330ml bottle from Liquid Solutions.  Pours a cloudy dark purplish-brown color with no head, only a few bubbles and a ring around the glass.  Leaves very slight lacing.  Aroma is fairly tart with red wine, cherries, wood, and spices.  Flavor is incredibly vinous, with dry, tart red wine dominating, along with cherry, raisin, brown sugar, vinegar, oak, and spice.  This is seriously one of the most wine-like beers Ive ever had.  Flavor is nice though, tasty and full, and finish is long.  Body is medium and the palate is silky smooth.  Carbonation is very low, at borderline Lost Abbey levels, but this actually doesnt detract much since this beer is so wine-like.  Drinkability is pretty average.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Poured deep murky ruby-brown with a small frothy off-white head - looks mysterious, I gotta go 4/5 for the chunkiness.  Love sour vinous aroma, cherry, prune/plum tartness, moderate alcohol and a hint of mid-bodied dry red wine - a bit musty, but this one pushed my buttons. The taste is dry, musty, minerally - the plummy sourness has faded, just a residual tart berryfruit acidity balanced against dry, earthy oak - I kept thinking ""is this not a vintage merlot?""  Slick, thick and acidic mouthfeel, fairly flat, with a long dry-resin bitter/acidic finish.

Sharp and tingly, but without being astringent. A good balance between malts, fruits, and sourness, and even burntness. Theres caramel there too. All fairly well integrated.

Dark red pour, with dusky brown murk at the edges and some mysterious amber gleams. Very minimal carbonation, but a mouthfeel thats smooth and silky, quite full. The nose is oak, leather, musky funk, and dried cherry pits. The flavor is amazingly complex, with one of the most superbly subtle uses of oak Ive ever encountered, giving the funk an oh-so-delicate vanilla complement (absolutely nothing confectionary about it, just earthy and inviting). Dried fruit and vinous characteristics come on in the finish particularly, with a nice tart smack in the chops.

Strong vinegar with just a hint of oak and earth. Pour was a nice deep dark murky brown with no head. Taste was nice and sour. Vinegar, funk and not much else. The thick mouthfeel almost tames the sourness and the lack of carbonation really hurts the beer. If this had the strong carbonation of other sours (or even any at all) it would have been in the 4s","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
3402,"2009-02-10",4.0,"33 cL bottle. Pours very dark brown with some amber hues and a small, bubbly tan head (more from the pour than from actual carbonation). I detect a sour toasted oak aroma before I even lift the glass. When I get it under my nose, I pick up some very interesting chocolate and cherry maltiness with even a very very distant roasted notes; the lactic acid notes and noticeable alcohol give the aroma quite an edge. The flavor is earthy spices when it first hits my tongue. Then toasted oak takes over, with some nice woody vanilla notes. Then comes the sourness, which grows quite assertive as the beer nears the back of my mouth. Some fruity notes pop up here and there, mostly cherry and plum. The finish is a bit surprising, as it takes a quick turn toward a rich dark chocolate flavor. Theres another spicy twang there, too, like pepper, sage, and anise. Sourness lingers into the aftertaste, as does a bit of alcohol warmth. This is an excellent beer.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

3402,"2009-01-15",3.7,"Bottle ordered online: Pours a deep brown with a ruby hue- a bit muddy looking on the second pour- when poured vigorously theres a wispy, loose bubbly tan head that fades. Very acetic aroma. A touch solventy, with acetone notes, along with a sweet barrel character- vanilla comes through and perhaps a touch of maple. Very slick texture, hardly carbonated (the less priming sugar isnt working for me). The flavor has a strong acetic presence, with a solid dark malt character. Sweet dark fruits are at the base- perhaps notes of raisin and brown sugar underneath vinegary/acetic notes. Some raspberry skin tannin character meshes with softly sweet dark malt notes which linger on the tongue. I need a bit more liveliness with this style, especially with the carbonation and body feel. Interesting and unique, but missing something to make it very good.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

There is also an earthy grape component to the taste which is reminiscent of a red wine. Some light vinegar. Palate is flat, medium body, oily, very much clings to the mouth.

3402,"2008-12-30",4.0,"12oz bottle. Unfortunately I think this one was infected, which is a shame for such a pricey beer. Poured a deep brown with a tiny head even when poured vigorously. Generated a little natural carbonation. Very pungent balsamic vinegar nose with lots of cherries and yeast. The flavor is where the problem became noticable. Taste is extremely sour, like Cantillion level with lots of very sour cherry, alcohol soaked raisins and some caramel and wood. The aftertaste is where it goes very wrong. A vile metallic like aftertaste dominated, as a friend put it, tasted like blood. I have no doubt this was a small infection, that ruined what otherwise would have been an amazing beer.

Smells of malt, prune and wood with slight vinegar. The mouthfeel is light-to-medium though this beer has some viscosity though it finishes quite dry. This is a very tasty beer with white grapefruit and spiciness reminiscent of Muller-Thurgau up front and a mild prune and wood finish. The acetic qualities are well-balanced, with the tartness between an old, viscous barrel-aged beer and a Flemish red. An exceptional sipper!

Not like any other beer I’ve ever had, but it shows some characteristics shared with l’Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien 2005. This beer is very drinkable but unfortunately quite rare.

It is very complex, difficult to describe, but does not follow the normal progression a beer does on the palate.  It starts with caramel, becomes moderately sour(not overly), and then the oak kicks in and almost lifts my taste buds to cherries, vanilla, maybe grapes then some funky yeast.

Flavor balances chocolate and caramel, sugary berries, plum, tart sour apple, alcohol and wood. Moderate finish in lots of fruit, and smooth to go with the malt yet carbonated just enough to accent the sour elements.

Several more tastes and Im dropping it . The palate becomes a little too dense and could use some lift, detracting from the complexity of the flavor and almost making it seem oppressive. Sugary and fruity, but very little sourness behind the huge sweetness, and what sourness there is comes almost exclusively from the vinegar.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Color is  dark brown, similar in appearance to a porter. Aroma, to me, smells like a red wine, with major oak notes. The flavor changes about 5 times every time you take a sip. It starts out mildly sweet, then moves to a wine-like flavor and once it hits the back of your tongue slaps you with a big sour note. Not much in the way of hops that I could detect.

3402,"2008-09-15",4.7,"#1300.  I have been waiting a long time for this brew.  The pour yields an extremely dark and inky violet or prune color.  Easily the darkest Flemish sour I have ever seen.  Despite a vigorous pour, only a small, glassy, fat-bubbled gathering forms at the edges.  There is absolutely no lacing, but dense, viscous legs skate down the glass.The aroma is simply intoxicating.  Sour cherries and reduced grape juice lead the sweet-tart, fruity charge.  Notes of tannic, dark fruit skins lend a vinous quality reminiscent of an Oregon Pinot Noir.  Earthy, mineral notes resemble that of a clean, wet stone, while old, worn leather and pipe tobacco lend deep, sweetly pungent elements.  Soft, melted chocolate and subtle vanilla show as well, while the oaken barrel imparts just a smidge of the requisite Struise Farm funk. Despite the seemingly endless complexity, the flavor is supremely integrated.  The chocolate element emerges as a major player, soothing and caressing the tongue after the fruity, balsamic tartness strikes.  Sour cherries, ripe figs, and a hint of ground cinnamon are enhanced by the soft, old, funky oak.  The supreme balance between sweet, sour, and savory is incredible.Round, slick, and viscous in the mouth, the body is almost completely void of carbonation, and that is perfect in this brew.  It literally feels like liquid velvet as it rolls across the tongue.This beer is nearly perfect.  It represents the ultimate bridge between the wine and beer worlds.  Sure to please lovers of both, my only wish is that this was an every day luxury.  Simply breathtaking.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Looks like coffee - no head, except for a few tiny bubbles around the rim of the glass, and I did pour ""generously.""  Pretty nasty looking actually.  The aroma is a different situation altogether.  Massive overripe fruitiness that balances the sharp tartness.  Belgian yeast and sugar are readily apparent.  Smooth oak and smoky notes.  Spicy in the nose.  Earthy and vinous and plummy.  Jammy.  Flavor is incredibly smooth and balanced.  Definitely a flemish sour but lacking in that puckering tartness that can be a put off.  Raisiny and a tiny bit hot.

3402,"2008-05-21",4.0,"Bottle enjoyed at Kulminator, Antwerp.  I was really excited to have this one, as Im a fan of sour beer.  Due to high expectations, I was a little disappointed: it wasnt a life-altering experience, and was merely a really good beer.  Opaque black with a soapy, fizzy head.  Smells sour and old-world, with vinous oaky tinges and earthy spices; complex and hard to pin down, except for the strong acidity.  Full bodied in the mouth but not as sour as I expected until the finish.  Oily texture of cherry skins is cut by a very balsamic sourness that intensifies later in the beer.  Bright and fresh in the middle with an oaky background.  On multiple sips, I swore I could taste scallops cooked in brown butter with lemon; it was such a remarkably specific taste, and was probably the product of the specific sour characteristics of the beer melding with the gouda we had as a palate-cleansing snack.  Overall, the taste and texture was like a less sweet Duchesse with lots more oak qualities, like the oiliness and the darkness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

As this is mentioned it the beers commercial description, I will not take off points here. Nose is very interesting--almost port-like at times--picked up on some cinnamon, chcocolate, black cherry skins, oak tannins, spices, balsamic vinegar and a little but of funk. Flavor had more balsamic, black cherry skins, rich tannins. This was a very complex beer.  I felt like the flavor lacked a little bit of tartness that I like in my sours, and the palate was kind of boring considering what was going on in the nose and flavor departments.  Still, a very interesting beer that I feel privileged to have tasted. Struise continues to impress.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Palate is big and aggressively tart as well as well coated.  Flavor is surprisingly sour, especially for the age, very fruity, front leaves a sweet tingle on the tongue after the swallow, some other berries in there I cant place.. a touch of earthy leathers and a known alcohol, very complex flavor as there are several things I cant pick out in the fruit and spice, very well blended though, I think some white peppers are in there as well as the oaky notes come through on the tongue.

Pours an extremely dark opaque brown with just the faintest whisper of a bubbly soap scum head around the edges. wonderful rich aromas flow from the glass. Apple skin and a touch of cherry add a nice sweet fruity vein through a nice woody, lactic, farmland. Some metallic, or even ozone, notes on the nose as well. A slight roast too. Not burnt, but more than toasted, with an earthy and choclately character. When tasted there is a sudden flash of tin and then malt that moves quickly out of the way for lactic acid and balsamico. Very soft carbonation (almost none). The nice smooth sourness sits on top of a raisin and fig bed. Old dark fruit compote. Some fresh dates. Then earthy roast chocolate breaks up the dark fruits and hangs around for a while. Red wine soaked pears start to come in and mingle with a touch of blood or tin.

The taste was quite bizarre and nothing like I had anticipated. If truth be told I wasnt immediately taken by this, it was a classic grower in the way that records back in the old days (the 80s say) would chart at say No:33 and take about 5-6 weeks before the reached the heady heights of the top ten this was just like that but by the end I wanted more. Loz on the other hand was taken in by it straight away and kept remarking about the cherries, old classic wine qualities and lovely effervescence of course she was spot on, I got balsamic vinegar again we both noted the similarity to the Rodenbach Vin de Cereal, this was great.

3402,"2008-03-31",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2014 Bottle rated March 31, 2008. 
  
This gem arrived courtesy of ygtbsm94. It cost me a Red Poppy, but goodness was it worth it. Theyre both outstanding sour ales, but this one has got a certain something extra that puts it over the top. Im afraid there is nothing in this one to keep me from continuing as a hopeless Struise fanboy.
The beer pours much darker than I ever would have expected, deep thick brown with a ruby glow emanating from within. Relatively modest head - I should have poured more aggressively - with long-lived lacing along the sides of the glass. Absolutely beautiful beer. (Two thirds of the way through the glass Im coming back to write more about the appareance;  I cant get over how beautiful this beer is. I never do that. Id give it a 6 out of 5 if I could.)

The aroma is rich with sour cherries, mild vinegar and tannic notes, the acrid notes of a finger rubbed against an old 1920s black rubber fountain pen, light herbal spicing. The flavor...ah, the flavor. Where do I even start? Lovely cherries, tart but not too tart. Rich earthy notes, like burying ones face in a pungent spicy humus layer, woody tannins, just a tiny bite from the acidity, spices that ceratinly dont jump to the attention but which, on serious contemplation, must be there to round out the complexity and balance this elixir with the perfection that it displays. Never sweet like (the delightful) Goudenband, but never lacking for ample sweetness to balance out the flavors. Rich, earthy, full, spectacular.

Im in love. Id buy this by the case if I could, and drink it every night before bed. If I had but one beer to illustrate what beer has to offer to a wine connoisseur, it would be this one. 
A final note: My poor wife says it tastes like a metal key dipped in Worcestershire sauce. I dont know if Ive ever felt so sorry for her. Its as if one played Bachs 5th suite for solo cello, and she heard only nails along a chalkboard. Total 9/5/10/4/18=4.6

Bottle rated April 24, 2009. Much of the above holds, but this one is really flat -- almost no carbonation whatsoever. As a result, appearance drops by 1,  palate drops to 3 and overall to 16 for an 0.4 point drop. Hope the other couple of bottles in my cellar dont suffer the similar flaw. But still -- for a flawed beer? Dang this is good stuff. 9/4/10/3/16=4.2. 

Bottle rated March 10, 2010. Another flat bottle, and the balsamic intensity is bothering more. A bit on the sweet side? Somehow the flavor isnt anywhere near the 10 that I recall.The aroma is near-perfect, but the other flaws are too forward. I would have gone about 9/4/7/3/16=3.9, a big drop. Given the last two ratings fell off significantly, Ill push well in this direction.
Bottle rated January 15, 2014. Fairly still pour, only minor foam around the edges of the glass. Cherries / cherry pits and -- is it steak sauce?? A nice sweetness meets a bit of balsamic in the aroma. Strangey enough, Id say it has an almost perfect mouthfeel despite the lack of carbonation. It does a good job of being what it is. Not nearly as dry or quite as tart as the sinners 08 Im drinking side-by-side --- and not half the beer that the sinners is. I think this one simply hasnt aged well. I remember it being so much better.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Without knowing it I poured this beer precisely as the description suggests... cellar temp, into a tulip, with a bit of height... the result is a small brown film on top of a deep brown body.  The nose is first some licorice and chocolate with heavy wood tannins, but its a faint aroma overall, not exactly whafting out of the glass.  Spicy licorice and syrupy smoke, with an explosion of acidic licorice, liquid smoke and a flavor that resembles blood.  Peppery on the back, with a buzz of spicy wood and prickly licorice/smoke/char, and then a strange caramelized melon note, with some fruitiness in the lingering finish.  A strange beer.

3402,"2007-12-16",4.2,"Huge thanks to Mike for the chance to try this beer!!  Shared between my brother, mike, and I.  Great aroma on this beer full of earthy notes, sour under ripened fruits, a little bit of acidity, and even a little vinegar...but not enough to be obnoxious.  the aroma was where it was for this beer.  Great stuff!  The flavor was lots of the sour and tart fruits with some presence of muddled earthy tones.  There was a little bit of a metallic finish towards the end...but that was about the only fault I could find in this magnificent beer.

3402,"2007-11-29",3.5,"From ygtbsm94.  The beer pours brown and dark, no head, very still and looks dead. Aroma starts off nose tickling sour, good start.  Its a very balsamic  vinegar sour and has a very thick cocoa maltiness behind it.  Also, a spice herbalness at the end of that. There is a nice cherry/strawberry thing in the fruit area.  Taste is very underwhelming, especially after the first hit of sourness in the nose.  There is a low level of sourness in the flavor, the fruit flavor is very subdued.  My biggest complaint goes to the mouthfeel, which is a bit slick and way too under-carbonated.  This makes the beer come off as light and watery in the flavor department.

3402,"2007-11-01",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2007 In short: Intensely sour/tart beer.  My favourite Flemish Sour Beer? Maybe
How: Mtl-crew Halloween-tasting session.  Bottle from Rastacouere my hero.  This is from the first batch (and only one so far I believe)
The look: Cloudy purple body without much head
In long: From the nose you know youre in for something intense.  Its a tight rope to walk to make such an intensely sour and tart beer and not fall in the vinegar side.  But the earthmonk does not only walk the tight rope, its making backflips on it.  Sour oak and tart dark cherries (or is it the other way around?) supported by a chocolate backbone and some spicy notes.  Intensely sour/tart/acidic.  Im talking making-funny-faces sour/tart/acidic.  A sipper.  It might be sweet, I dont know,  my taste buds were too busy with other more intense aspects of the beer.  The really soft carbonation would be considered dull in any other beer but is totally fitting here.  Ive been smelling the empty bottle for a few days now.  Drinking that unannounced masterpiece with my favourite beer-geek friends was one of those beer-moment.  Its remembering moments like that that fuels my passion for beer although unfortunately it is also because of beer that I dont remember many moments like that.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3402,"2007-10-31",4.0,"Bottle at the always packed Delerium Café.  Very dark brown beer with a thin tan head.  Lovely nose initially, chewy cherry with some light red grape, balsamic character and a touch of oak and vanilla.  Loads of woody/earthy notes.  Classic Flemish aroma, light acetic with lots of raisin and red grape.  Some light spiciness hiding behind the fruity top notes.  Flavour is surprisingly soft with a light sweetness and a touch of oaky character.  Pronounced cherry and balsamic flavour.  Less acidic and with more fruitiness than the aroma would suggest.  Soft tobaccoish/leathery flavour through the middle.  Lovely plummy fruitiness on the finish with the acidity also helping balance the sweetness.  Surprisingly balanced for 8%.  Nice brew.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3402,"2007-10-28",3.3,"33cl bottle from Joris/Brad. Also sampled this at Delirium Cafe. I didnt do a rating from the bottle at Delirium as Id already had a few beers (read: 8) and I didnt really like it, so I figured it must be inaccurate. Well, not much has changed, and this time Im (mostly) sober. Dark black pour with no head. Aroma is very earthy, cumin, mild sour, high grade balsamic vinegar. Taste is kind of trapped in an odd minty/spiciness -- south asian spices -- and all sorts of odd fruit notes -- pineapple, clementine, papaya. Nothing really fits, nothing meshes together. The sourness up front is nice but afterwards a million flavors hit from a million angles and it becomes, in my opinion, a trainwreck. I really just cant get into this beer. Sometimes Ill take sips that seem alright, but in the end, most of the time it just goes down in a really odd fashion. Hell, Ill admit it, I didnt even finish the bottle at Delirium.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

More puckering sourness in the taste, together with all the flavours of Mother Nature:  Earth and Wood abound.  Tingly on the tongue but thats the sourness rather than carbonation which is minimal.

3402,"2007-09-15",3.7,"33cl bottle with cap from ygtbsm94.  Thanks Brad!!  The next batch of Earthmonk wont be ready until the end of 2008 since the beer sits in Bourgogne wine barrels for I think 18 months.
       No carbonation and no head.  Extremely dark reddish brown color.  The wine barrel aging is supremely evident in both the taste and aroma.  Down to the strong musty barrel nose on the first sniff.  The sourness is something between apple and sour cherry.  It reminds me of a mild version of a bad hair of dog adam I had.  I see similarity to red poppy from the barrel, but this is a bit more mellowed.
       Stings and puckers the tongue if you hold it in your mouth with a long lingering sourness, reminiscent of balsamic vinegar.
      Poured back into bottle and did the big pour from 1foot, and got an interesting 1"" large bubble head that quickly fades to a medium bubble ring around the glass.  Aroma was about the same.
    Taste is fruity, and yet toward the dry side.
    I cant say Im the biggest fan of this style, so Im trying really hard to like this one, because of its high rating.  I should have tried it with a friend to gain a better appreciation.  If I didnt know about the high rating of this beer, I would simply say its bad and my rating is generous.  But knowing this beer brings my rating up a bit.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
3402,"2007-09-09",4.1,"750ml Bottle with cap & synthetic cork, Best by date of July 2011, Sampled September 2007
Pours completely flat looking with a couple bubbles sitting around the edges of the glass.  When some additional beer is poured from a height of 1.5 feet (46cm), a very large bubbled frothy, quickly disappearing, amber tinged, light brown colored head is summoned forth.  The beer, a concentrated-amber / black-cherry color, is dark enough to be opaque as it sits in the glass but shows a brilliantly clear dark ruby color around the edges.  The aroma is quite tart smelling with notes of balsamic vinegar, lactic acid, tamarind and some touches of cherries & other vaguely fruity notes.  There are also some light, aged / oxidized malt notes that lean towards sherry in the nose.  The aroma is quite tart, quit nice and quite enticing for this lover of sour beers.  As the beer warms a bit, rich malty notes become much more noticeable; significant caramelized malt aromatics, toasted grain, brown sugar and toffee become much more apparent and actually soften the tart aromatics over time.

The beer feels completely flat, yet has some fullness to the body; almost a bit viscous as if there should be quite a bit of residual sweetness.  The beer is fairly dry, but there is a touch of malty sweetness (though not quite as much as the palate might suggest).  Richly malty, with a chewy, rich, almost umami character to it.  Definitely sour, but not as much as the aroma might have suggested; the acid character is here, it is just that the body of this brew provides a really nice counterpoint and even foil for the tartness, such that it is not as overwhelming as it could be.  Quite fruity tasting but leaning towards the dark side of the spectrum.  I get notes of sour raisins, dark pie cherries, tamarind, figs, prunes, notes of sherry & Madeira.  As the beer warms up a bit, a touch of woody / tannic astringency becomes noticeable in the finish (I think this is more from fermentation character than any wood used in the brewing of this beer, but I could be wrong).  As the beer warms it picks up a striking balance to it; even at the beginning the flavor was balanced, but as the beer warms the aromatic components balance out, as does the body & flavor components.

Despite being flat, this beer is rich & tasty; I am actually quite surprise how good this beer is with the lack of carbonation (the rich mouthfeel really helps here).  Hopefully I can get a hold of a carbonated sample of this brew as I have a feeling the carbonation would make this beer quite stellar.  I certainly got hung up on the lack of carbonation at first, but the more I taste this beer the more impressed I am by its complexity and balance; I still think some noticeable if not effervescent carbonation would put this over the top though.  I actually was a bit disappointed in this beer at first, but it has really grown on me, and in fact really needs to breath a bit before it comes into its own.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Thanks to sliffy for cracking this open.  I had just traded for a smaller bottle which I now look forward to sharing with some non-Ratebeerians to expose them to just how awesome beer can be.  If only this were available in the midwest (specifically Wisconsin) the world would be a much better place.  It might even give Dan Carey a run for his money.  As it is, do whatever you have to get ahold of this beer and any other Struise release.  While I was initially a bit skeptical I am now convinced it is one of the best breweries around.
Aroma / Appearance - Sourness mingles with cinnamon, brett, black cherries and chocolate brownies.  Underneath it all is the smell of fresh figs.  The deep red body is borderline black; not even a trace of light was able to escape unscathed.  A tan head decorates the top to create a perfect looking beer which could be admired for a long time.
Flavor / Palate - A sour and tart feeling washes over the mouth from the first sip.  Dry chocolate, cherry cough syrup, coffee and finally peat work their way across the tongue and throat.  The finish, while sour, is not quite as intense as expected.  This is an excellently made Flemish sour that gives the Rodenbach Grand Cru a run for its money.  The nod only goes to Rodenbach because I can get it locally.  If this were available Id be buying it all the time.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3402,"2007-06-26",4.3,"Bottle thanks to sliffy!  Poured a deep chocolatey brown with a loose caramel-beige head on it.  The aroma found ridiculously deep cherry skins and semi-sweet toffee (great balance gave deference to the tart side), and some darker caramel sugars.. slightly oxidized feel with increasing cherry skin tartness as the drink went on.  The flavor added a very complimentary oaky accent to the tart cherry skins.. some vanilla and even more faint chocolate notes across the middle.  Expertly sour on the palate with a long, memorable finish.  Great brew!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3402,"2007-06-26",4.1,"Bottle @ Delirium Cafe, Brussels.  This is an intriguing Sour Ale.  The aroma is of cherry juice with a slight acidic punch at the end, and the beer pours reddish-brown with a small white to slightly off-white head.  The taste is very interesting, as the juicy notes appear in the front of the taste and the acidic bite hits you in the end.  The beer may be slightly TOO acidic, since every sip seemed to burn the back of my mouth a bit, but thats largely indicative of the style.  This beer is a winner and the best sour ale Ive ever tasted.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"

The beer pours to a clean mahogany body with a thin white head.  The aroma is cherry juice, sour earthy malt and hops, and tart lactic acid.

3402,"2007-06-17",4.4,"2005 bottle, 75 cl, courtesy boboski.  Ive been on a good run of Flemish sours lately, and its style I like due to the variety in each offering.  And this one was interesting, and one I had been waiting a while to try.  

It poured a dark brown with ruby tints.  There at first appeared to no head, but a latent carbonation made itself known after a few seconds.  Fascinating aroma - sharply sour, the initial whiff has some real vingear-like qualities, but after that theres some real herb-and-spice aromas along with cloves.  Taste begins with a sharp, concentrated stab of sour, but strangely the aggressive tartness backs off a bit for the duration.  This allows appreciation of the herbal qualtiies present.  Something about the brew reminded a bit of Ricola cough drops, so perhaps whatever herbs and stuff are on the front of the Ricola bag are in this brew.  Drinking this also, not surprisingly, reminded me of Pannepot.  Overall, not insanely sour, but remarkable for its complexity.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
3402,"2007-06-15",4.3,"2005 bottle.  Courtesy boboski.  You sir, are a baller.  Pours a deep red maroon with a very small to almost no head.  Definitely has some time on it.  Light white bubbles swirl around the top of the beer.  Smells of the funk, some acidity, fruitiness, cherries, lemons, and more funk.  Taste has some tartness to it, but not overpowering sourness.  Kind of drinks like a fine wine.  Nice full body to it, very fruity with much of the funk as well.  Some cherry or raspberry are there but not too sweet.  Nice tartness in the finish but leaves a warming coat on the palate that just tingles the taste buds.  Awesome!","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
3402,"2007-06-14",4.2,"Courtesy boboski. 2005. Dark ruby/brown with a layer of tan/light brown foam. Gorgeous color. Aroma of tart cherries/dark berries, vinegar, airy yeast, stale earth, apples/pears. Flavor adds sourness, strong malt support, and light dose of earthy, floral perfume. Body is a bit thin with very light carbonation which is easily tolerated because the flavor profile provides enough sharpness on its own. Still would like a little more weight to the body, have to get a fresh bottle. Excellent brew.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
3402,"2007-06-13",4.4,"2005. Deep mahogany pour with brighter reds and some violets deep inside the soft body. Very little carbonation. At first no head forms, but slowly carbonation streams through the thick body and forms a slick sheet of a light beige head. Soft, sultry tartness and just-crushed cherries and blackberries lead in the aroma, which is apparent from a distance. Chocolate truffles and grapeskin(whose velocity and appeal increase rapidly with warming) follows in the quiet parade of funk. Light cognac and licorice seeps through - it fits just a little too well. A cola component emerges but does not detract whatsoever. Alcohol is modestly concealed. Caramel malt is full and absurdly complex. Early in the interpretation this seems to be a blend of equal parts funk, fruit and caramel candy. The flavor is a mirror image of the aroma, something I so rarely encounter and so desire when the initial interpretation of nuances is so exhilarating. Balance of sweetness and tartness is remarkably laid before me. Subtle and some of the most over-the-top elegance I can recall in any medium of entertainment, imbibery included. This is ridiculous. The carbonation is barely evident, so the most subtle of berry seed notes shine through. Overall the flavor is down to earth and one of the most incredible examples of balance conceivable. Bitterness is at a bare minimum, acidity isnt much of a nuisance or complimentary presence. Cherry notes increase their presence in conjunction with the increasing warmth. The finish is very mildly tart, chcolate and berry notes lingering forever. Mouthfeel is barely carbonated, resembling a skillfully aged unblended lambic without the jaw bruising acidity and tannins. Palate is medium bodied and exudes elegance and mastery of the style by a marvelous brewer. Breathtaking.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3402,"2007-05-28",4.5,"25 oz bottle, via Storm.  Pours a very dark reddish brown, sort of a dark mahogany maybe, under a minimal beige to light brown large bubbled head that settled to a thin ring of bubbles and a whispy film.  Not much in the way of visible carbonation.  The aroma is quite aggressive, and seems very fore-warning that Im going to be getting something quite unique here.  Rich tart cherry skins, balsamic vinegar, port, sherry, light soy, a hint of vanilla, some woody earthy notes (chardonney like?), and something that reminds me of fresh air coming in off the ocean.   The flavor was not as tart and cherry-like as I was expecting from the nose.  More like a Woody mixture of caramel, grapes, port, light soy like notes and a touch of vinegar.  Not really as acidic as I was expecting either, just a slightly puckering crispness that leaves some lingering oaky flavor.  This is probably the most vinous beer I think that has crossed my lips.  In an odd way, it kinda recalls a slight reminder of Gales Prize Old Ale.  Mouthfeel is just perfect for this beer, a nice full rounded palate coating consistency with very minimal carbonation that doesnt distract.

A world of different and indepent cherry character explode in a room filled with cork, toasted sesame and a lot of blistering sour orange peel and popping coriander seeds.

3402,"2007-03-28",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2009 75cl bottle BBE 02/07.  This beer for me, sums up Ratebeer.  In November 2005 I had to go to Antwerp for work at short notice.  Knowing that I would be staying close to The Kulminator, I put a post up on the Forum on this site asking that if I only had 2-3 drinks in the pub, what should I have.  Almost without exception, people suggested Struise Pannepot.  Getting that kind of advice is indispensible.  Pannepot is only one of three 5/5 scores Ive given.  Since then Ive followed Struise with interest and Ive had the good fortune to meet the guys behind the beers on a couple of occasions and Im pleased to say that they are tremendous people.  I picked this bottle up at the Low Countries RB Meeting in Antwerp last Sept. as part of the Kook farewell to Europe tour with Maeib and Duff, a great weekend which I owe to the Ratebeer site and people Ive met through it.  So thanks.  The beer is very, very dark brown/red with thin lasting beige tan head.  Lovely sour fruit aroma.  Bit of wood too.  Sour dark fruits of dark plum, black cherry and damson in mouth.  But its not overly sour, its balanced by some fruity sweetness too.  That sour aroma with dark fruits and touch of bitter choc is tremendous.  The fruit in the mouth is just so pleasant, sour and sweet at the same time.  Finish has drying sourness and more black cherry and damson.  Just so well balanced, the sourness never over runs it.  The wood adds to the whole experience.  Overall its a great Flemish dark sour beer.  The fruit is both balanced and outrageous at the same time. 4.6/5 Re-rate, 75cl bottle at Kulminator.  This keeps getting better, some yeast has woken up and given it a very soft carbonation.  The flavour in the mouth is now sublime.  One of the best sours, best beers full stop Ive ever had.  Every time I had another beer I wished it was this and it wasnt.  I was so jealous of another couple having this later in the evening.  Now in my definite top 10 beers of all time due to this bottle.  Exquisite and unlike any other beer Ive had.  It takes you to another place.  Sometimes my palate tells me when I have drunk something of sheer quality and this is one of those times.  Cant wait for the new version or to have this again on the old version at the Kulminator.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

3402,"2007-02-19",4.3,"Reddish, deep brown body with  quickly fading head. Slow going carbonation. A vital, penetrating aroma, nuanced with perfumey notions. Expressive esters bring a plethora of fruits, while spicy developments are drowned in the beefy chocolate scents. Those original, idiosyncratic flavours are translated in mouth to form a shining example of a beer that evolves during the same sip. From the initial fruity, vinous, berry-like profile, it quickly steps into deeper malt territories, feeding the drinkers soul with potent chocolate splashes. Its heavy sweetness is thankfully accompanied by the fitting full and rounded body (despite barrel-aging) that forces one to maintain a respectful, slow drinking pace. Moreover, that sweetness drinks into the woody acidity to find an equilibrium that avoids any cloying territory. Yep, can only echo Martins comments. This is to Flemish Sours what Pannepot is to beefy dark belgian strong ales. How the experiments must have been pointy and masterfully handled to come up with something like that, both inspired by the tradition and evolving further is a testament to the brewers art and however much we praise them, I can only imagine how the fun and discoveries theyve made on their way to this Earthmonk must remain their grandest reward.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3402,"2007-02-11",4.2,"Last May I was driving through the beautiful Belgian countryside, finally gazing upon the hop fields of Poperinge and the Westvleteren abbey, scenes I had dreamt about since my first few beers. Little did I know that my casual visit of the nearby De Struise brewers would be such an eye-opening experience. In the company of Carlo and Urbain, I had my first taste of the debuting Earthmonk, a cask-sample elegantly tapped and deliciously satisfying. A few months later, two bottles arrived in the mail, a generous donation that I was impatient to sample. The long maturation and bottle-conditioning were certain to yield the polish I had found in Pannepot and De Struises other excellent efforts. In appearance this Flemish Sour was unusually dark, a peat black hue glinting with deep ruddy highlights and topped of a ballooning off-white froth. Rich vinous tones erupted immediately, enhanced by copious oak and vanillin, and an intense licorice fragrance. The voluminous nose is decidedly unique and mouth-watering, sharing the qualities of ripe cherries, brown sugar, apple, milk and the overarching resonance of fresh mineral water. Sour at the offset, the flavor shifts through a gamut of fruity and malty notes, initially emphasizing juicy cherries, Granny Smith apples, wild strawberries and cola. Woodiness prevails just a moment later, accompanied by earthy brown sugar, leather and a hint of Balsamic vinegar. Finishing with a slight metallic tone, the aftertaste develops a remarkable chocolate and hazelnut aspect that Ive never seen before in the style. The obvious lack of carbonation is unfortunate but creates a rather fertile ground for the complexity of this brew to evolve. Earthmonk has changed since its days in the barrel, on one hand I regret the eminent Speculoos and brown sugar flavors that I had loved, on the other, I find the beer more intricate and mature, more sour and empowered. I can only see this brew improving, especially as I assume the good fellows at De Struise will have their refermentation well in hand next time around.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3402,"2007-01-16",4.5,"Bottle. Tasting 12-01-2007 (Søren, Peter, Carsten). Head was spare rocky and light brown which was quickly goon. Body was muddy with heavy particles and a ruby like color. Aroma was molasses, grapefruit, earth, bubble gum, grape, apple, ginger, vinegar. Reminded me somewhat of a heavy version of apple cider, but at the same time it was extremely vinous. Difficult to explain unless you have tasted this great stuff. Full bodied with a surprisingly soft carbonation. Flavor was superiorly playful, switching between light bitter and sweet notes with the moderated acidic always present. This really is an extreme beer and so well brewed. I still have one bottle left of this stuff, will let it cellar and see what happens, it is impossible to image that this could get even better.

The taste: a nice combination of sweet and sour. More sweet than I would have thought. Moderate sour cherries with some red wine notes, a little varnish, some vinegar. Light carbonation.

Nose is sour with tart fruits, balsamic vinegar, wet wood, red wine, sweet-sour candy, and quirky funkiness.  Taste is sour but not as sour as the aroma would let on. Tart fruits (cherries and berries mainly), woody notes, damp earth, wet leather, and vinegar notes. The tartness seems to hit the palate upfront combined with the carbonation. Its like a tickling tartness. Its unlike any other sour beer Ive tasted, in that regard. Body is bubbly and effervescent with a light-medium overall feel and a pleasant astringency thanks to the acetic  notes. Its bone dry at the end as well. Startlingly sweet in spots during the finish but I think this really aids the beer from being a bit one-sided.

Penetrating sourness dominated by forest berries and grapefruit with a dry wood tannin feeling on the tongue. This is a real flavor bomb. A great great beer and as said, very unique.

3402,"2006-12-14",4.3,"75cl bottle  Dark brown body with a red shine, very big bubbled lasting beige head; At first the nose gives away huge amounts of lactic and acetic acids, you actually have to pull your nose back, like when smelling vinegar. But just like any good vinegar this beer has layer upon layer of aroma hidden behind. Aromas of soft Valrhona Chocolate milk, cherry sauce made from half Amarena cherry and half sweet cherries with pit, it has notes of dry Danish soil (muld), bay leafs, both pepper corn and dried pepper fruit, roasted oak. I could go on forever, it has an amazing depth and complexity; The mouthful is soft almost velvety, it is almost flat (I think a little more carbonation would have been great), it is salty, sweet and sour in an incredible balance; It finishes very long with an initial fruit and lactic acid burn that turns lactic very fast and even a bit tannic, it stays sour for a very long time.

3402,"2006-12-03",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2011 The Musings:
As lush cherries in plush earth are deeply steeping,
And balsamic richness to the nose is leaping,
One can tell
The seed of luxury has been duly planted.

Dark chocolate is drifting, sifting through, and lifting
A gardenful of grapes around the tongue wafting,
So that one can tell
The germination of greatness has been granted.

Then,
Tartness sprouts its savvy snout, as a wooden drought
Flashes the filling fruit, and now there is no doubt
That I can tell
These roots are in my veins; I am nearly daunted.

Yes,
An illuminated assumptions guaranteed
Through the consumption of this wise cultivation,
And I can tell
That if I drank
As much of it as my seduced soul would permit,
I can confirm it, I would be a fat hermit.

The Bottom Line:
Although some might complain that some effort is needed to produce a big-bubbled head, most will indulge in this authentic Flemish deity, and perhaps ponder its resemblance to a more drinkable Cuvée de Tomme with a spicy finish. These De Struise Brouwers truly are as talented as they are generous.

Merlot specifically. Slight brown sugar but never too overpowering. Wonderful puckery sourness in true Flemish sour style. Glorious vanilla pod notes too.

Plenty of funk and no real hops or malt to detect. Quite unique even amongst other Flemish sours. Considering its flat the palate feels surprisingly spritzy.

Very nice lactic acid nose, with serious hints of earthy aromas and dry chocolate powder. Cocoa made from top quality ""full"" dark chocolate and raw milk - but without any sweetness. Slightly vinous. More sweet, but held in check by mild acids (lactic predominantly) in the taste. Fruity hints, and a punch of, again, chocolate. Earthy and leafy embellishments, but the integration is perfect. Retronasal, I get streaks of red wine and blue cheese, some fusels. As the brewers are very aware themselves, even if the aftertaste and palate are quite satisfactory, the beer suffers from a total absence of carbonation, refermentation having never started. In the Pajottenland, this would be called ""Loerik"". Who cares about refermentation? This is the perfect accompagnment for a blue veined cheese. Stilton and Earthmonk for me!


 Second, refermented version 
Good yellowish head. Nice headvy nose, with chocolate and lots of lactic acid. Nice, woody, lactic, yoghurt and a spicey taste as from sweet Spanish pepper coulis.

Not only did I find Carlo tweaking Tsjeeses (newest christmas beer) in the laboratory, he let me taste a sample of their latest Sour ale, I was perplex! What a guy, that Carlo, they do not make them like that anymore. Anyway, back to reality : EARTHMONK, what a horrable name for a magnificant beer of this kind.
Pours a brown red beer with a moderate beige head. This masterpiece is triple-fermented. Primary fermentation is in open stainless steel tanks. The deep earthy, sour character results from 12 months of maturation in french oak and then followed by bottle conditioning. Earthmonk is not pasteurized or filtered. The aromas are endless with some wine elegance, so flavourful and interesting. Medium carbination,  with a crisp, medium dry finish. Thanks to Carlo","BELGIUM","yousee"
