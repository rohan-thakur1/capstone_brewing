Juice-like body without much carbonation. Easy drinking for the abv. Very sweet on the palate. The wine grapes really standout but they come off more like grape juice with the sweetness I suppose. Still a fun mead experiment.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

4154,"2015-08-03",3.9,"Fad: PÃ¥ Mikkeller & Friends. DybrÃ¸d med et let mudret billede uden skumhoved. SÃ¸dlig duft af bÃ¦r og en smule tannin. SÃ¸dmen kan anes.

4154,"2015-08-01",4.3,"Bottle bought @ Mikkeller & Friends. Batch 0609. Pours deep ruby red leaving some pretty legs on the glass. Smell is fruity and floral with high quality complex honey, dark rustic grape must, caramel, toffee, pollen, bees wax, moist hay, leather, moist wood and nose-tingling alcohol. Taste is sweet, tiny sour, heavy fruity and slightly floral. Mouthfeel is fat, round, viscous, oily, boozy, slightly fruit skin astringent and near full bodied. Finish is sweet and tiny sour with dark honey, dark grape must, bilberries, black cherries, leather, dried pine needles, moist wood, minerals and alcohol. Delicious Pyment where one plus one really becomes one. Delicious mead base with subtle multi-berry complexity added from the grapes. Very pricey at almost 600 DKK (iirc) but itÂ’s a high quality product I would be willing to pay for. Cheers and happy mead day!","GÃ¶teborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

4154,"2015-07-23",3.5,"CBC. Everyone else from the festival is entering their rating under the Syrah version, but I asked which version it was when they poured it, and they said Cabernet/Syrah to me, so IÂ’m sticking to this one. That also fits perfectly with what was probably the leftovers being available at Mikkeller and Friends two months later. Hazy dark red without head. Aroma is sweet, honey and red grapes. Flavor is quite sweet. Sweet finish with warming alcohol. Oily. 020515","Beder, Aarhus, DENMARK","Rasmus40"

Second batch of Aphrodisia, bottle 3 of 22; 50/50 cab/Syrah blend created for Mazer cup; Silver award winner, and rightly so.

Pours a dark purple with nice legs and tear; both grape varietals and honey come through on the nose. Taste is outstanding, no doubt due to my love of the grape blend. The honey cuts the tannin from the Cab, but you still get dark fruit, vanilla, and violet from it. Syrah comes in with its new-world boldness that stands up to the cab and complements the honey. My absolute favorite pyment to date.","New York, USA","tchaos"
4154,"2014-05-12",4.5,"Beatiful Cross over between Mead and Wine! The Dry and Sweet blend beautifully together and each have a distinct characteristic that come together.

4154,"2014-04-20",4.1,"Bottle shared by daknole. Aroma of wine grapes, honey, and oak. Deep purple color. Similar to cabernet version just not as complex. Still excellent though","Alabama, USA","thebitterendaz"
4154,"2014-04-20",4.2,"Bottle share courtesy of Dak, thanks! It pours with a deep ruby red body. The aroma offers up smooth slightly waxy honey sweetness rolling into firm dry smelling red wine notes and some booze. The taste pulses with nectar sweet ripe grape and beery fruitiness followed by firm dry rich red wine notes. Wow! The play between the honey sweetened fruity notes and the deep red wine dryness works very well here. The richness just gets deeper with each sip. Oh yeah!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4154,"2014-04-14",4.1,"Reddish purple pour with aroma Cabernet and Syrah grapes and berries. The taste is bold and with heavy grape flavors. The honey and fruity flavors adds sweet but not cloying due to the oakiness.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","jntfan1978"
4154,"2014-04-13",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2015 Slightly boozy smell (itÂ’s 16% ABV) along with light grape. Taste is berries, grape, that classic cabernet taste, honey, and a bit of alcohol taste and warmth at the end, but not so much that it is unpleasant. This was my third favorite variant of the four Aphrodisia meads that IÂ’ve had. I prefer sweet jammy tastes tastes to dry tastes. If you are looking for sweet like I am, I would go for the Syrah/Grenache, then Pinot Noir, then Syrah/Cabernet, and then the straight Cabernet. If you like dry red wine (I donÂ’t), then the reverse order will probably fit your tastes more.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
4154,"2014-04-13",4.2,"Bottle shared during a mead tasting hosted by daknole. Graceful aroma of rich cab grapes, mellow honeycomb, and French oak. Pours uber-dark purple with ruby highlights. Damn, the taste is wonderfully layered and refined with Syrah and dry Cabernet flavors early, a rich honey sweetness, plenty of boozy heat and a heavy oakiness all combining for a blissful, complex flavor. Slick mouthfeel with a sweet then dry finish. One of the better meads IÂ’ve ever tried.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
4154,"2014-04-13",4.4,"Pours like red wine. Aromas of berries, earth, and tannins. Wine like. Wonderful wine like flavor. Loads red wine grapes, earthy and tannic. Light dark fruit, honey, and hints if cherry pit. An insanely great mead","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
