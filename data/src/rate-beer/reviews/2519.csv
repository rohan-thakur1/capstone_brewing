2519,"2017-03-16",3.2,"Draft at Brew Craft in Tauranga. Son of a... bartender asked if I was sure I wanted this because its a low alcohol and I was like BITCH IM A F***ING TICKER AND DAMMIT THIS IS MY 9TH BEER HERE SO I THINK IVE EARNED THE RIGHT MEOW TO ORDER THIS PLUS ITS TOP 50 IN STYLE ON RATEBEER!!! Damn, my kind gets no respect, yet I still believe were the most evolved form of humankind, sitting here outside on a nice New Zealand late summer day destroying our livers, ignoring other people, and running up crazy beer totals meow. Wont be so funny meow when I get to 5000 ticks, the lifelong goal of most people on earth, will it meow? Meow before I was so rudely interrupted (cat game score 5 for those keeping track)... Clear copper with a well-formed white head. Aroma is caramel, pineapple, biscuit, light fruits. Flavor is light, malty, biscuit and grain, some pineapple. Lighter feel with average carbonation. Good for what it is meow (6).","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
2519,"2016-09-06",3.3,"Light peachy forefront. Well balanced sweet and deticant. A well balanced hoppy beer","NEW ZEALAND","Hoponmate"
2519,"2016-09-06",2.4,"On tap at 16 Tun. Aroma is sweet and fruity, almost bordering on white chocolate. Flavour has a bit more fruit to it, but its also quite watery.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","explosivedog"
2519,"2016-03-22",3.6,"Juicy, fruity aroma - pineapple, mango, papaya. Dark golden color, poor head, nice lacing. In taste its rather empty and flat, but hey its 2,5 abv beer. Still is quite hoppy, quite fruity. Rather low bitterness but it gives what it should - very refreshing, crisp, easy drinking.","Poznan, POLAND","adasko"
2519,"2016-01-02",3.8,"Bottle from New World Wellington (December 2015). Pale golden, white head, tropical fruit aromas, juicy fruity hops, solid malt, light body, medium bitterness. Excellent light beer!","AUSTRALIA","ShaneJ"
2519,"2015-10-09",2.2,"Draft. Gold with a white head. Sweet malts, spoiled fruit, diacetyl, and a thin mouthfeel. Not completely horrible, but definitely underattenuated and thin.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
2519,"2015-02-17",4.0,"This beer is amazing. 2.7% and it tasted like a full IPA. They acheived what they set out to do. it is not a diluted weak thin bodied waste of time and money.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","KapitiCritique"
2519,"2015-01-15",2.5,"Why bother calling this an IPA? Aroma is of tropical fruits and aged cheese. Flavor is as expected for a 2.7% brew. Tropical fruit from hops and not much else. Thin body supported by hops rather than malt. All things considered you could do worse with a low alcohol beer.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","GlassBrass440"
2519,"2014-11-14",3.7,"Fruity quite refreshing beer. A strong lingering on the back if the palette with flavors of grapefruit, Mandarin and maybe mango. Very enjoyable and definitely a summer drink for me.","NEW ZEALAND","Colossus07"
2519,"2014-08-19",3.4,"On tap at Brothers Beer, Auckland, August 2014. Clear darker golden with a small head. The taste was nicely hoppy with pineapple, hay and mango. Similar taste. The finish was dry and hoppy. A tasty Low Alcohol.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","gyllenbock"
2519,"2014-02-20",3.8,"On tap, in Rotorua. By far the most pleasant beer Ive tried from Croucher (I missed the Chocolate Cherry Porter...). This has a lovely aroma of gooseberries, kiwi and lychees. Very fruity on the flavour too. Grapefruit juice - of the imported, reddish grapefruit. Delicious. I was told this was a particularly sour batch, so maybe this rating does not apply for the normal, but it just perfected that grapefruit. Never felt so much grapefruitiness in a beer before. Nice and sour. I love the idea of a low alcohol IPA. ...

OMG, there is a ""Session IPA"" style now. What the hell is that? So the Kennel Club has rejected a different pattern of colour for this breed? This is getting as complex and discriminatory as the ethnicity page of a NZ medical form.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
2519,"2013-12-16",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2013 A master-class in the art of full flavoured low alcohol beer brewing. Along with 8 Wired ""Semiconductor"" it is a highlight beer of the year for me.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
2519,"2013-09-28",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2014 The head is ok, the body orange-red. It smells hoparomatic, hopintensive, fruity-orange, mandarine, refreshing. The taste is hopromatic, fruity-sweet, bitter, bit malty, aromatic.","Otorohanga, NEW ZEALAND","kiwianer"
2519,"2013-08-04",3.4,"Draft at Brew Craft. Pale golden yellow color, off white head. Aroma of grass, lemon, light onion. Taste is fresh grass and lemon. Nice!","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2519,"2012-05-09",4.5,"Im scoring this as though it wasnt a low alcohol beer, because it just doesnt taste low alcohol!
Lovely malty body and balanced bitterness. Mouth feel is full, and hoppiness  is like a regular English ""bitter"", not than a mild.

And you can drive home!","","AussieAl"
2519,"2012-01-09",3.6,"This was low-alcohol? I had literally no idea until I logged on. Amber colour and a little hazy with a white head that sank into this beer. Definite hoppy spruce aromas as well as chlorophyll and long grass. Flavours are similar: floral, resinous and moderate to pronounced bitterness. A long finish and very tasty. In the IPA style and real contender, in Low Alcohol, a triumph. 
Well done brewer.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
