Light tart blueberry aroma with faint perfume, cotton, & light candy sweetness. Flavor is full of sweet blueberry, mild cinnamon spice, even a touch of cherry skin. Some faint floral notes & a touch of tart fruitiness. Dry finish, a little watery in the back-end. Just decent.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
4251,"2014-07-27",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2014 Pours a hazy purple brown from the bottle with pink purple head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma is sweet fruity delicious with a yeasty malt back end. Taste leans more toward the fruity tart blueberry with a bit of saison yeast esters and funk. Pretty nice, but I would like something a bit more sour, beer it would age nicely. Nice balance, reminds me of a Belgian sour.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"

4251,"2014-03-23",4.1,"750mL bottle, no date, $19.49 at Olive Tree Market in OB a number of months ago. Clear medium pinkish garnet and a fizzy one finger pink head, not much retention. Smells of tart blueberries and their skins, some mild lactic sourness. Very enticing. Flavor follows, nice and tart, fresh blueberry skins, light lemon, little oak. Bone dry, scant bitterness. Sourness peaked at a 3-4. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation that foams up in my mouth. Tasty--not crazy complex, but pretty tasty and refreshing.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

4251,"2014-01-26",3.5,"750mL bottle drunk on 1/25 and 1/26/14Black raspberry purple with lighter strawberry red tints. Fluffy white head is flecked with pink and recedes slowly to cover. Plentiful sediment in the bottom and tons of fine carbonation rising.Blueberry skins in the nose remind me of Mystics Vinland Two, yet there is some lactic tartness here that helps break up the blueberry. Light powdered sugar and vegetal notes seem to go hand in hand with the fruitiness, but its faint and mostly passing. Medium to high strength of aroma, no alcohol noted, very little malt.Spicy, tart, rich blueberry flavor is very authentic and well-done, it just seems to lack a follow up with much maltiness. A very fleeting sourness is interesting, but ultimately leads back to a lightly sweet blueberry flavor mixed with some light malt sweetness (white sugar-like). Tight, creamy almost, carbonation helps bolster the light body and certainly asserts this as a refreshing summer quaffer. Seems like this wasnt intended as anything more than a light, refreshing blueberry golden ale, but the oak and lactic character tease your expectations. Would have really liked more malt body, barrel character and sourness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Some will call this blastphemous but the aroma on this is more pure blueberry than Blabaer. Truly devine! Flavor shows some tart, unripened fruit, Brett elements, funk, mild cheesiness, vinegar, and some lemon zest that adds acidity. Not terribly sour, just enough to add complexity.

Sharp flavors malty core supports blueberry and subtle oak tones. Sharp texture is somewhat firm and fizzy, leaving a woody and blueberry finish.

Keeping up the trend of excellent beers somebody shared the first of two fantastic beers from Cisco. This was a lighter sessionable offering that was the perfect change of pace. If not for the New Glarus Serendipity that I had a few weeks later this would have been the best fruit beer Ive tried in a while.

Aroma / Appearance - Reddish purple and warm it glows with life. A light opaque edge and clean white complete the image. Blueberries, white pepper, and a general fruity feel make me feel as though I am walking through a pick your own blueberrry field during peak season.

Flavor / Palate - Tart blueberries are slightly sour but lack the acidity of a true sour. A sweet short lived transition carries into a gentle finish. Compare it to high powered American sours and there are better choices. But if you want a slightly different fruit beer than the normal check out a fine release.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4251,"2013-03-01",4.2,"Bottle but I have also had this on tap as well super fresh. Pour has a crazy purple blueberry color and a thin cap of off white head that holds very well. Aroma has such amazing punchy fresh blueberry, medium tartness, berry skins, seeds, and oak. The bottled aroma is just as good as the draft version. Mouth feel is medium and the carbonation average. Flavor packs in the authentic blue berry flavors, berry skins, seeds, light tartness, and a finish of berry sweetness. Really an incredible beer and far surpasses anything else I have tried from them.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"

The beer appears a radiant blue purple hue with a soft, pinkish head. The aroma does indeed bring the promised blueberries, along with funky brett. Brett character has a large presence throughout, overpowering the fruit to some degree. Still, a tasty beer. Perhaps not as complex as I was hoping. More yeast and bugs and a larger serving of blueberries might liven things up. Spritzy carbonation and a bit of a prickle on the tongue. lingering brett in the finish. The aftertaste doesnt last too long. Certainly worth a try.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
