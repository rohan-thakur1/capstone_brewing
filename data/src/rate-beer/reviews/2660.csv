To say Im excited to review this one might be the understatement of the millennium. Picked this up awhile back with Rachel at Trader Joes. It was the last one available and I had never heard of it. I tried a taster of it on June 11, 2015 at Blind Lady Ale House and gave it a 4.5 on Untappd and just wrote: Taste. Wow. I dont have any recollections of flavor and anything else, so this will be from scratch. 

Poured a mahogany color with two fingers of khaki-tan, rocky head, which dissipated rather quickly. Average spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled big whiff of boozy bourbon right away, followed by oaky wood, Belgian candied sugar, coconut flakes, vanilla, dried tobacco and toasted brown sugar. Hidden behind the booziness is some fig, dates and raisins, more leathery tobacco and sugary caramel. (Smell - 4.25)
 
Tasted just amazing. Instantly remember how good this thing was. Got smoother bourbon than the nose, but still boozy, warming all the way down to my legs. Also Belgian candied sugar, sugar cane, oaky wood, leathery tobacco, toasted brown sugar, maple syrup, sweet caramel, boozy chocolate syrup, vanilla, coconut flakes, plum, fig, dates, dried raisins and cocoa. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Long, boozy, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Loved this one. Havent put together the overall ratings, but might be the best Firestone beer Ive ever had. Battling neck-and-neck with Sucaba. (Overall - 4.75)

3.25 A: Dark brown, almost black color. Less than one finger of short lived, fizzy beige head formed. No lacing left.

4.5 S: To start, you have to have a creative mind to call this a quad. This is very much a big, sticky FW amalgamation reminiscent of one of their anniversary beers. That said, the barrel is the forefront of the nose, which isnt surprising given that Belgian beers and surely quads live in subtlety. Toasted coconut, oak, vanilla, and leather stick out. Moderately boozy. Sticky grenadine, spicy peppery Belgian yeast, candi sugar, brown sugar, molasses. Dates, black currants, raisins, tobacco. 

4.5 T: No surprises here. Its just as sticky and rich as it smells. Tobacco, leather, dates, and black currants are the strongest flavors. Toastiness, cherry juice, brown sugar, molasses. Again moderately boozy. Spicy peppery yeast.

4.25 M: Heavy, heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Very sticky with sugary amylase bunching in the back of the throat. 

4.5 M: Its not a great quad, but it is a great beer. It seems more like a huge mesh of a bunch of different beers. Quite nice.

The beer pours a hazelnut brown color, with brighter ember hints in it. Yields a small, fizzy head, which wont rebuild after excessive swirling. 

The nose offers a tremendous amount of Bourbon soaked oak, spicy, warm, full of coconut and earth mingled vanilla. This gets coated up by rock sugar, toffee and caramel, exhibiting a profound sweetness, gently balanced by the multi layered barrel. The nose finds an additional layer in roasted, warm nutshells, licorice and wild honey.

Drinks with just the required amount of carbonation, subtle, yet well accentuated, preventing the beer from sticking to the tongue, keeps it going with a lot of nuances becoming detectable on the palate. Provides a silk, not overly thick body, ensuring the sugar rush to maintain enjoyable.

Tastes of earth coated, melting toffee, a subtle spiciness, more earth and a nice roast quality, enriching the malts. As the Bourbon gets introduced to the palate, more spices unfold, entangled into rock sugar and a pleasant, slick coffee dryness. While this produces a rich sweetness, it does by no means overpower the beers overall taste profile, tamed and enriched by the well pronounced Bourbon. Finishes with a noteable bite within the otherwise complete silk mouthfeel, representing a warming, still enjoyably balanced Bourbon peak. A dry spice bitterness represents the introduction to the beers finish, with rock sugar and melted toffee remaining detectable, showcasing a clean, yet appealing ending.

This may be the most complex, well nuanced sweet beer Ive ever had. At first, Ive been disappointed by its thinner mouthfeel, then I started to undertand its benefits. The palate reacts more sensitive to peppery Bourbon, the utmost silk mouthfeel and changes within the malt sweetness, without becoming sticky or cloying. Nontheless, this is still a sipper, a pleasant one though.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2660,"2015-12-06",3.9,"Pours an opaque dark chocolate brown color with mahogany edges and a two finger beige head that quickly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Surprisingly good retention given its style and ABV with sporadic streaks of soapy lacing left behind.

Sweet, slightly boozy aroma with a nice barrel character thats decently integrated into the leathery malts, dark fruit and sweet molasses/brown sugar notes of the base. Charred oak, toasted coconut and vanila bean along with boozy bourbon and brandy sweetness. Underneath the barrel, theres some leathery tobacco, dark fruit, toffee and caramel. As it warms the sugar really starts to stand out.

Lighter body than expected and not quite as complex as the nose suggests. Again, theres a strong barrel presence but its nicely integrated into the malt, vinous fruit and Mexican sugar flavors. Strong oak presence with a decent amount of dry char and sweet boozy heat. Slightly smokey with leathery malts, tobacco and vinous fruit, notably fig, date, raisin and other dark berries. Toffee, caramel and burnt sugar adding more sweetness. Some boozy heat in the finish but this beer drinks very easy considering the high ABV.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Writing from memory, because I havent reviewed the beer when I had it, 6 months ago, but I just had to say its as close to perfect as a beer can get
2014 vintage. Dark, but not as dark as a stout, with the sweet smell of caramel and bourbon.

-Alcohol is present but not overly so.

The beer was formulated to be sweet and malty for blending purposes, and its clear in the flavor. Raisin, fig, grape -- all the dark fruits, left out to ripen. A rough, alcoholic edge lingers on the tongue. Alcohol is intense, tongue-numbing -- I cant feel my tongue -- and blazing thorough the nostrils. Very low, tingly carbonation, medium body. Sweet, boozy and inebriating. A little heavy on the barrel as well as a bit one-dimensional.","","PartyFowle"

The aroma blends molasses, brown sugar, oak, roasted malts, fig raisin, caramel malts, and a hint of malts; the taste is such an indulgence due to the high sweetness blended well with a mild umami, slight sourness, and a touch of booze flavor, the final of which continues and warms through the finish with a hearty malt flavor alongside it.

2660,"2014-07-24",4.1,"2014 Bottle.
Appearance: When not held to light the body appears to be a deep chestnut, though when held to the light the body shows a beautiful deep garnet hue. A short, but quickly disappearing, light tan head appears on the pour, but all thats left is a bubbly ring after a moment.
Aroma: The aroma leans fruity with plums, fig and raisin, followed by deep caramel aromas, some brown sugar, hints of booze, and a dash of leather. The aroma is mellow, though showing off its contents with ease.
Taste: Big dark fruits in the way of plum, raisin, and fig are noticed throughout as are big malts giving flavors of caramel and brown sugar. Bourbon is noticed mostly during the finish with a dash of leather and tobacco. The malts really rise up just before the bourbon hits to push aside the fruity intro a bit. This is a great sipper, full flavored and enjoyable, complex and inviting. The booze is hidden far too well in this, its present but its noticed mildly on the finish.
Palate: Full-bodied, bordering on thick, with light carbonation.
Overall: I find this to be a beer brewed to high standards. Firestone Walker rarely disappoints and this is another winner. Big in flavor while remaining soft and hiding its alcohol far too well, this could be dangerous!","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Pours a medium, poorly retained, fizzy, beige head over a clear brown (SRM 25) body....nose is heavy dried fruits with plum, raisin, light molasses, tobacco, dust, minimal hops, malts and sugar dominant.....taste is sweet, with brown sugar, light molasses, hints of treacle, dried fruits including raisin, prune, hints of tobacco, cocoanut, light vanilla, barely detectable hop bitterness, balance to the malts and sugars.....mouth feel, body light, but 13.4% ABV will do that, alcohol burn (not fusel) present, sticky (no surprise with all the sugar), carbonation adds light tingle. This is a very, very sweet highly alcoholic (which increases sweetness) beer. It needs long aging time to begin to approach any sort of balance beyond simple sweetness. As it is tasted now, it is too immature to do it justice. They really should have aged it in neutral (glass, steel) containers for a year or two, charged more and had a better outcome.

An incredible addition to the anniversary series. Sticky and coating but not cloying. Can still feel this on the roof of my mouth and continued to enjoy this minutes later! So
Glad I got a chance to try this!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"

2660,"2013-10-20",4.0,"Sample at GABF. Glad I waited for this. Classic barleywine with strong malts and low hop profile. Very well balanced though with this bitterness working purely to complement the malt. Strong caramel flavors and dark candy sugar. The oak adds another dimension and tempers the sweetness some. An excellent, deft execution of a style that often leads to beers that overly sweet and syrupy.

Pours reddish brown with tan head and thin lacing. Aroma is malty with notes of molasses, oaky booze, cigar shop, and a hint of the tropics. Taste is quite sweet but with a very pleasing bitter, leathery aftertaste. Full bodied, lively carbonation. Excellent brew, but I like Sucaba a little more.

Sweet with big chocolate. Lingering roastiness, big hot alcohol burn on the tongue and throat. Extremely thick, viscous mouthfeel. Soft carbonation, full body. Overall: glad to finally get my hands on this. It's a little too rough to come together as a beer on its own, but the imprint it leaves on the anniversary is fantastic.

2660,"2012-12-08",3.6,"Sample FOBAB 12 - Went to this one early as Ive always thought FW does quite well with the extreme ABV beers.  Poured brown with a medium sized head.  Aroma was tons of sweet caramel, bourbon and dark fruits.  Flavor was quite good, albeit somewhat hot - again, very sweet and sticky, dark fruits abounded, some toffee as well.  A bit one-dimensional, but the dimension is not bad at all.  Palate was actually quite smooth compared to what one might expect - minimal carbonation - warms as it goes down.  Good, yet not great...","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
2660,"2012-11-21",4.0,"Enjoyed on tap at FOBAB. Served in my FOBAB taster glass.

A: Pours a semi clear brown color with a tan head forming on the pour. Nice retention on the head, it recedes slowly to a thick ring and leaves nice splotches of lace.

S: Dark fruits, caramel and some light bakers chocolate. The barrel is there faintly with some light bourbon and oak.

T: Light bourbon and some heat up front. Sweet honey, dark fruits and toffee all present. There is a spicy hop flavor as well that seems to creep up and recedes at different spots during each sip. 

M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation level.

O: I thought this was solid overall. There was a little too much heat from the booze for me even at 12%. The beer did get better as warmed up so Id suggest waiting a touch before consuming given the opportunity.

Seriously syrupy. Sticky indeed. Sweet, for sure, and countered entirely by alcohol, not by hops. This is like melting down a few random pieces of candy containing milk chocolate, caramel, marshmallow, and some nuts, and dissolving them in alcohol. Tastes like a candy store.
