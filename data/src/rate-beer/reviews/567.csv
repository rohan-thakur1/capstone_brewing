Flavor is doughy yeast, crusty bread, cooked tart berries, dry leaves, light dusty caramel, light nutty notes and some stone fruit and acidic notes dulling toward the overly yeasty finish.

AROMA: apple and pineapple early, with enjoyable barnyard funk as promised; ...

Just a farmhouse brown with brett. After further investigation, apparently Ommegang says this is closest to a biere de grade style, and is not intended to be sour at all. It does taste that way. Hazy amber red orange brick color. Thin ring of khaki head. Leaves some thicker, but loose lace. Medium to bigger body. Soft, moderate strength carbonation. Kind of slick finish. Earthy, kind of spicy, fruity aromas. Seeing the cherry and pineapple, but more of a sweet caramel kind of toasty earthy malt too. Moderate sweet taste, only the very slightest light hint of tartness. Very light bitterness. Overall, an alright, kind of funky brown biere de garde, and it gets better as it sits and warms up... But not worth $14 in my opinion. Not so wow.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
