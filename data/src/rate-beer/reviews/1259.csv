1259,"2013-10-11",3.7,"(Cask) clear, deep copper, nice offwhite lacing and head. Nose is quite fruity, peach, stone fruit, caramel, complex as anything, raisin, more but hard to describe it all. Taste is toasty, fruity, yeasty, complex, a little sweet, nice English noble hop bitterness on the palate finish and a rather medium-thick body thats well carbonated nonetheless. Great cask ale.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
1259,"2013-03-24",3.7,"Nonic pint draft at Hogshead in Denver, Colorado.  The pour is a gold copper brown, with a small light tan head.  The aroma is light cracker malt, paired with a bit of toffee sweet, then some crystal malt. The taste is caramel nutty crystal malt blended nicely with grassy dry floral hops.  The palate is light bodied, with low soft natural carbonation, and a clean dry finish.   Easy drinking session beer, quite well made.  This beer really came together as it warmed, great balance.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
1259,"2012-11-22",4.3,"On cask at the brewery. Dark chestnut color. Smells nice and malty. Taste is very good, chewy malts, caramel, nuts. Really surprising beer and something I would order again without hesitation. I dont see too many ESBs around and when I do they are unimpressive. This was very flavorful and just a real solid beer.

1259,"2012-07-07",3.6,"Cask at the brewery - listed as an ESB, so I have the suspicion that this is the same beer as the ""English ESB"" in the database - hazy bright red - nose explodes with bright fruity note (grapefruit, strawberry), earthy hops, bready malt and toffee - flavor provides much the same, quite a bit of grapefruit (without the bitterness, but with a touch of the acidity), but this is mostly a malt showcase, with some toffee notes, toasted bread - some hop earthiness but low bitterness - well done.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1259,"2012-06-30",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2013 For the cask version.  Darn good ESB.  Solid toffee and caramel malt core, plush mouthfeel and great hops balance.  Thick almost pillowy fading head.  Stoked this is my new neighborhood brewery.

1259,"2012-02-18",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2013 Sampled during 2012 Firkin Rendezvous @ Bristol Brewing Co.  Nutty copper with a foamy light tan head. Smell is nutty, earthy, full of toffee and a light fruitiness like tangerine. The flavor is nice and smooth, sweet and earthy nutty. Starts a bit like vanilla cream, but melds into a toffee biscuit maltiness. Slight fruitiness like apple or pears, but earthy enough to not be ""fruity"".-----& tried it again for the fist time in a year and a half.  Its worth way more than my 3.6 rating.  I wasnt able to take notes the second time around, but its really swell.  Benchmark ESB for sure.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
