The flavor is raisin, plum, some heat, big sugary malts, fluffy palate. Very good. Unibroue has essentially created its own style with these dark Belgian style spicy beers.

Not too leathery, slight earth feel. Aged for a year, you get a soft bourbon like sensation of cheese. Appetizer like strength, highly sweet. Deeply warming, decent freshness while lacking a little of it. Very tasty with solid balance in the flavors, although overly acidic and coarse.

79,"2016-04-23",3.9,"750, corked and baled. Its ridiculously interesting to find a Unibroue Ive not yet tried. So cool that theyre still making new stuff--I probably just needed to be reminded to go look for it. Pours a murky dark brown with a gigantic, surging, pillowy off-white head that rocks and rolls around in the glass until all the way after the beer is gone. Not a geyser at all, though, despite being served above cellar temp. Popped like a shot when the cork came out, though. Put that all together and youre expecting something good before the glass even settles. Nose shows big malty caramel notes along with some soft plum and red apple skin notes. Creamy medium body with surprisingly moderate carb. Mid-palate shows beautiful fruits and malts, but unfortunately lapses into an aluminum note at the finish. Bummer. Thankfully, this goes away after it off-gasses for about half an hour, so be patient with this one if that aluminum tang drives you nuts (it certainly drives me nuts).

79,"2015-12-13",4.1,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate caramel, raisin, banana, apple, coriander, and a touch of clove.

The nose was ready alcohol, holiday loaf/pudding spices, including some star anise, dark fruit as plum/prune, some caramel, and maybe a bit of molasses sweetness.

79,"2015-11-05",3.9,"750 ml bottle, poured into an oversized wine glass at ~50 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a murky, impenetrable mahogany brown, and forms a massively fluffy head of ecru foam that lingers for roughly a month. Lacing is a sheet of foam along the glass, with distinct ridges marking the level of each sip.

Smell: Clove and spice, like ginger and cardamom, spring out of the aroma straightaway, atop a base of raisin and fig. Theres a bit of an earthy spice note as well, much like a white pepper, and the leaves of a juniper shrub. Beneath that, caramel and candi sweetness lurk, alongside some hints of a soft wood.

Taste: Not unlike a ginger snap dusted with some mulling spices and pepper. There is a core of sweet caramel malt, atop which layers of spice, fruit, wood, ginger, pepper, and earth are stacked, with the pepper and earth forming the thickest and outermost layers. Theres also more than a hint of alcohol heat present, especially during the finish and a bit afterward, which is slightly tempered by notes of candi sugar sweetness lingering alongside it.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied and sticky, this clings to teeth and tongue alike. Theres plenty of heat from the ABV.

Overall: If Im being honest, this is probably my least favorite Unibroue BSDA. The aspects of earth, ginger, and pepper threaten to overwhelm all the other flavor notes present, lending itself to less complexity on my palate than a Trois Pistoles, Maudite, Terrible, or 17 Grande Reserve. There also seems to have been either no attempt to disguise the ABV, or the spicy-peppery tone of this beer only serves to magnify it for me. Its a good beer, especially if one wants a Belgian Strong Dark Winter Warmer, but it misses the Unibroue mark as far as Im concerned.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, light banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, pepper, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, light roast, and herbal/yeast earthiness.

Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, light banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, pepper, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, light roast, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of yeast spiciness and light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, light banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, pepper, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming lingering after the finish.

Whats a New Year without a little Resolution? A very nice winter brew as it stands, but Im glad I bought two of these, because the second will definitely go for a nice extended cellaring (next New Years?) to give those flavours a chance to mature and mellow. (And while were on the topic, what the hell is this thing? Ratebeer says its a spice/vegetable, beeradvocate says BSDA, and untappd calls it a winter warmer. Personally, I think it feels like a quad.) I waffled a little on my ratings, but after some thought I think this is very nearly up there with some of the big Belgian quads. The high ABV is definitely present, but not overwhelming at all, while the enthusiastic spices and carbonation balance it out nicely. Big, bombastic, and enthusiastic - is it any wonder I like it?

79,"2014-12-28",3.5,"Visual:
Pours a dark brown robe with some carbonation spotted through the reddish hue when held to the light. The head is lively and finely structured, of a light hazel color, roughly a finger high. Lacing properties are good, but the head does not retain very long.

Aroma:
Very aggressive nose dominated by hickory, cloves, licorice and alcohol. The malts do come through a bit but the brew is too young to have a complex and appealing nose, in my humble opinion that is.

Taste:
The taste is very neutral but does have a dominant woodsy character, once again I believe, due to the young age of the beer. I got almost no sweetness, but I did get some burnt grains which I think would develop an awesome flavour as the beer ages. The alcohol is present and offers a nice warmth all the way from start to finish. The brew has a moderate density and delivers a long finish of strong spices and alcohol.

Overall:
This is a nice beer, but I think it needs some time in the cellar to develop complexity and balance and become a great brew. Cheers!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Beardbeerman"

79,"2014-10-31",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2015 Bière brune foncé aux reflets rubis, totalement embrouillée, très effervescente, et surmontée dun très large col beige, très dense et mousseux, bien persistant, et qui laisse une riche dentelle sur les parois du verre. Arômes de levure belge (typiquement Unibroue!) avec quelques épices (poivre et piment de la Jamaïque surtout peut-être un peu de clou de girofle et de muscade) et beaucoup de sucré (caramel, érable, mélasse, crème brûlée et même, cest un peu étonnant, caramel brûlé). Dailleurs, les effluves ont une tendance évidente vers laspect «brûlé» du malt torréfié (pain très grillé, grain brûlé). Par moment, des odeurs sapparentant à des esters de fermentation semblent percer, mais ça reste occulté par cet «effet brûlé» plus ou moins agréable rappelant un peu le gâteau aux épices oublié au four ou le caramel carbonisé au fond dun chaudron. Nez plus ou moins agréable donc, intensité moyenne, complexité intéressante. En bouche, pétillement moyen sur la langue, onctuosité intéressante au palais, le breuvage est moelleux et velouté, présentant une certaine rondeur. Au goût, levure Unibroue, pain très grillé, sucres (caramel, léger érable, mélasse, crème brûlée), mais on retrouve encore ce petit «effet brûlé» qui rappelle le gâteau trop cuit ou le caramel brûlé, même si cest moins pire quau nez. Aussi, beaucoup dépices en bouche, cest très chaud, poivre, piment de la Jamaïque, et peut-être aussi dautres piments forts considérant la grande chaleur qui envahit les joues et la gorge du dégustateur. On note également un petit goût herbacé (houblon ou épice tel que coriandre?) en arrière-plan. Lamertume est minimale, cette bière est principalement sucrée et épicée. En bouche, comme cétait le cas au nez, lintensité est moyenne, la complexité est intéressante.

Les épices sont très en évidence avec des notes de pain dépices, de gâteau aux fruits, de cannelle etc. Leffervescence très active, combinée aux notes dépices, rendent cette bière pétillante et vive. Signature Unibroue reconnue cependant. Agréable à boire sans être un grand cru. Pour le temps des fêtes a coup sur.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","dandeman"

Good body strength, round mouthfeel, the flavor is basically caramel, with some fruity esters and mild spicy component. Correct bitterness.Not a big fan of spiced beers, but its well brewed anyway.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
79,"2014-10-10",3.9,"Bouteille - 750ml. Corps brun foncé avec effervescence moyenne. La mousse beige pale est dépaisseur moyenne mais sétiole rapidement. Arome riche et complexe dans lequel on décèle des nuances de baies sauvages, de caramel, dépices et de levures belges typiques dUnibroue. Lalcool reste très subtil. Son goût malté/houblonné est puissant mais bien équilibré. On peut apprécier des notes fuitées, sucrées, boisées et liquoreuses. Belle finale longue et réconfortante. Ça faisait longtemps que Unibroue avait cessé de créer de nouveaux produits. Jespère que ceci est le début dun regain de créativité fructueux et aux antipodes de la malheureuse tentative de percer le marché des bières désinvoltes il y a environ dix ans. Je prends la résolution den mettre une en réserve jusquau Nouvel an!","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
79,"2014-10-09",4.3,"A very nice dark ale to start off the soon winter season. Notes of ginger bread, dark fruits like prunes, burnt caramel. It has it all. Reminiscent to Unibroue 17 for me, but lacks the notes of aging/oak that U17 presents - but well worth the money.","Brandon, Manitoba, CANADA","silvorgold"
79,"2014-10-08",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2014 Arôme de caramel, dalcool & dépices sur une belle robe couleur sirop dérable. Jai trouvé son gout de levure belge plutôt simple, malgré les épices, sur une finale en bouche vraiment top de biscuits caramélisés et de toffee. Autrement dit: tout pour la finale. Excellente bière de nouelle  ahah! :))","Quebec, CANADA","Smallweener"
79,"2014-10-06",4.1,"Noire opaque aux rares reflets rubis, coiffée dune épaisse mousse couleur crème. Leffervescence est vigoureuse et incessante. Au nez, un bouquet dépices se dégage sur une trame de levures belges. En bouche, la mousse goûte le caramel doux. Lorsquon rejoint enfin la bière, on pense dabord à une vague impression de cerise noire avant que les épices se mettent de la partie. On parle dun pain dépice sur la bouteille et on ne nous ment pas. Je goûte de lanis, de la muscade, de la cardamome, du gingembre, de la cannelle avec une finale poivrée qui se mêle à la chaleur de lalcool. À travers le tout, des notes dérable et de café fraîchement moulu sont perceptibles. Le sucre résiduel est bien dosé; il enrobe lensemble sans alourdir la dégustation (mais ça demeure une grosse bière assez lourde, ne le cachons pas). Cest excellent. Je ferai des réserves pour les fêtes.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","BiereLuc"

79,"2014-10-05",3.7,"Kind of thin body, but dark with a white soapy head and some lacing, not much head retention. Aroma of dried fruit, banana, grapes, cola and coconut. Taste is like a typical belgian ale with a touch of holiday spice, touches of pumpkin even. A touch of pepper in the aftertaste. Very vibrant tingly palate. Unique beer but still within the realm of Unibroues style. Abv very well masked, you dont get any sense this is a 10% beer. Quite nice.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
79,"2014-10-05",2.1,"Apparence: D?une couleur brun très foncé opaque, elle est coiffée d?une mousse généreuse d?une bonne durée. Effervescence difficile à évaluer, mais semble quasi inexistante. 

Arômes: Au nez, ce sont des arômes de malt caramélisé et dépices. 

Saveurs: En bouche, cest un corps surprenant, assez léger. Au goût, cest des saveurs de malt légèrement caramélisé et épicé. De durée moyenne, il y a une légère effervescence et une amertume quasi inexistante.

79,"2014-10-05",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2014 *** Re-Rate... (à noter que la deuxième fois où jai bu cette bière, la mousse était généreuse et tenace... Sans doute suis-je tombé sur une mauvaise bouteille la première fois...) 
Bière de couleur brun foncé, dont la mousse est dabord généreuse, mais ensuite très fugace : il faudra brasser le liquide dans le verre pour la voire apparaitre de nouveau. Nez de réglisse rouge, dépices. Rien dexceptionnel. On dénote la présence des levures typiques dUnibroue. En bouche, cest puissant : notes de réglisse encore une fois, de fruits rouges, de mûres, de bleuets. Capiteuse, cette bière me semble sapprocher du style Abt ou quadruple. Javais espéré quelque chose de plus différent. On reste, il faut le dire, dans la lignée de la Réserve 17, de la Terrible, etc. Ça goûte la Unibroue, ce qui nest bien sûr pas un défaut, mais pour la moitié du prix, jaime autant prendre une bonne petite Trois-Pistoles.

Aroma is very complex, full of Belgian yeasts, spices a la gingerbread, and very light toffee. Flavour is extremely complex and amazingly well-rounded, with notes of toffee, gingerbread spice, and complex Belgian yeasts. Wow -- this is one of the most complex Unibroue beers out there. High carbonation allows all the flavours to shine. Phenomenal stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
