Head is average size, creamy, biege, with thick yet slippery lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is very dark brown. Flavor starts slightly sweet and acidic, then finishes slightly sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium, creamy, with an almost flat carbonation. This Dry Stout really surprised me. Great aromas and a great palate equals a very enjoyable beer.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

Il est assez difficile de déceler quoi que ce soit au nez, étrangement, même en y plongeant le pif. Je finis par renifler quelques traces chocolatées et de café. Grâce au service au nitro, la bière est évidemment ultra nuageuse en bouche et les saveurs de chocolat et grain rôti sont bien propagées. La finale est plutôt sèche, ce qui contribue grandement à sa buvabilité. Simple, mais très efficace.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","RickTheRick"

The beer is dark brown, nearing black. The head is thick and beige and leaves some random lacing on the snifter. The aroma offers dark fruit, smoke, and roast. The flavor is quite nice. Eight ounces down, this is likely the best Irish stout I have yet had. Light bodied and easy drinking, with spot on carbonation. I would definitely drink this again.

Pours an opaque blackish pour, some brownish edges, dark with a cakey tannish head. Laces small as it dies to a solid frothy ring. Aromas are a good roasty base, touches of chocolate, sweet, some old cold coffee with cream. Touches of smoke and earth. Initial is lighter bodied preaching some good roast, peanuts and earthy bitterness. Touches of coffee, chocolate on the bitter side, light and some creamy sweetness moving in. Surprisingly bitter and good lingering earthy roast, peanuts, sweeter coffee. Finish leaves a touch of Baskin Robbins like vanilla, and then earthy roast and toast, cocoa. Pretty good for a smaller Irish stout that held up on its journey well. Good carbonation, palate enveloping roast. Solid and roasty with just that proper amount of sweetness to keep it grounded. A pretty nice Dry Stout, if I dont say so. Proven over and my surprise of the day. Growler kept it surprisingly in good shape. Quality Irish Dry Stout Id love to have again.

Pours pretty much black, but not too thick, with a small tan head that lasts.

Aroma is very nice - roast and coffee dominate, and there is also an earthy aspect as well as a hint of chocolate.

Flavor is also mainly charcoal-like roast and coffee.  The dark chocolate asserts itself more here, and there is definite earthiness and even a little wet dog (thats a new one, huh?).  Wet dog is one of my favorite beer flavors.  A little anise as well.

Very dry on the palate with lasting drying from the roast.  Finishes cleanly, and has medium body.

Overall, this is just excellent for a style that often isnt that exciting.  Supremely drinkable.  This probably wont surprise most of you, but I had this next to a Guinness and it was not even close!  The Guinness was way sweeter and less dry, more watery, and just less flavorful in general.

1637,"2010-03-18",4.3,"draft @ RedLight.  I ordered a pint for St. Paddys day...what a treat!  This beer has a roasty dark chocolate aroma and a brown-black appearance with small off-white head.  Despite the heavy appearance, the body is rather light, delivering a creamy, dry, roasted-malt taste with hints of dark chocolate and to a lesser extent coffee and nuts.  Finishes clean and refreshing for such a dark beer... no cloying malt sweetness here.  Very drinkable...if I didnt have to work early the next day I would love to tip back 2 or 3 more pints.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Telios"
1637,"2010-03-17",3.5,"Growler from Cigar City.  Pretty solid and an excellent choice for St. Pattys Day.  Pours very dark brown, looks black in the glass with some amber sneaking through.  The aroma shows oats, coffee, chocolate and some vanilla.  The flavor is all of the same, nothing more, nothing less, no surprises.  A light roasty and slightly creamy palate.  Comes across as a bit light but also probably the lowest abv beer so far Ive had from CCB and still quite good.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Good nose.  very nutty, with notes of coffee and irish cream.  flavor is pretty sweet with the irish cream coming forward.  solid bitterness from the roasted malts comes through in the finish.  good creamy mouthfeel.  sweet for a dry stout but a very enjoyable beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"

Medium body with a creamy, soft mouth feel and ample carbonation.  Wow, this beer is much better than I expected.  The first thing that hit me in the flavor was fresh roasted coffee notes followed by dark malt, and touches of chocolate, caramel, and molasses.
