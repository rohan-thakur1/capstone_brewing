74,"2016-07-25",3.8,"Tap at Dexters. Sort of classic orange-tan body. Foamy white head, soapy. The sage aroma is big. The herbal tones are bigger than the brett, but it still has a nice balance. Very clean body, easy drinking. Sage, rosemary, pretty interesting stuff. Delicate, true oddball beer in the Belgian tradition. Better than I expected.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

74,"2015-03-23",3.9,"Sample at the Winking Lizard Epic Tap Takeover on 03/14/2015. The beer pours a hazy golden color with a medium thin white head that dissipates steadily to a wispy film. Stringy lacing on the glass. Aroma of brett, fruit and malt. Medium body with flavors of herbal yeast, funky brett and doughy malt.

74,"2015-02-25",3.5,"651 ml. bottle. Release #2. 8.8% ABV. Den# 2087 Per the label. Pours a thin fizzy, poorly retained, white head, over a clear, effervescent, yellow (SRM 3) body....nose is light colored fruits, (pear, apple), Belgian funk, hints of cereal, balance to the yeast.....taste is very slightly sweet to start, with pear, apple notes, cereal, mild Brett notes, becoming dry, lightly vinous, lingering Brett notes, with balance to the yeast.....mouth feel, light body, alcohol slightly present, carbonation high with high tingling spritz. The recipe for the beer has obviously changed since the initial entry. It is not a typical Saison and comes much closer to being a Belgian Golden Strong with the exception of the Brett. This is a lovely beer, which is interesting in both aroma and flavor, and quite light and quenching. The Brett was handled with a light hand and is not hyper dominant. The herbs were quite hidden.

T: Starts off with big oak and peaches but it doesnt last long. It will follow through with light hearbal funk, a ton of sage and rosemary, with a light spice. It ends flowery if that makes sense.

74,"2014-01-22",4.4,"Clear gold with a thin sticky white head, with a sharp Bretty nose of mellow peaches, wood funk, tangerine, hay, and saison malts. Flavor is smooth and robust, with a lot of complexity. Smooth barn malts and light Belgian pale malts meet with a big dry funky Bretty tone, a touch of wood, a bunch of peach tones, and a dusty semi-sharp funky peach finish. Very nuanced and Bretty, without being too funky. Love the depth and peachy saison undertones.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
74,"2014-01-18",3.6,"Tap at Denver - I wasnÂ’t a huge fan of the base beer, but I dig this - the barrel smooths out the sage - the peach and wine are.accentuated by a very mild funk from the brett - the mild.sweetness rounds out the experience - pretty well done.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

74,"2014-01-04",3.9,"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber. Poured slightly cloudy golden color with a thin white head. The first aroma I got was baby diaper, very off putting. After a few sips and some time to breath the aroma improved greatly. Tropical fruits, apricots/stone fruits, sage, slight tartness, funky brettanomyces, soft earthy and woody notes. The flavor hints at a Drie Fonteinen lambics, this would be the yeast, just my guess. It is herbal, peach, tart. The finish is nice and dry. This is better then I was expecting.
