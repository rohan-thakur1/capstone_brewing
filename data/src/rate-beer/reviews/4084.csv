4084,"2014-05-09",3.7,"Bottle fill at the source. Thanks Paul!
Served in a Chouffe glass.
Hazy to murky orange with a thin white lacing on top that disappear fairly quick.
Aroma is the strangest mix I have thus far met when it comes down to Lambic beer: banana, bacon, some soap, some cleaner, hint of flowers, apricot and yeast witha sprinkle of old wet (sweet) wood.
Flavours of bitters, apricot, banana, bbq, some meat, hint of minerals, yeast, herbs, different approach of this style. Never had something like this before.
Aftertaste is bitter, yeasty, hay, corn, malts, light herbs and some yeasty fruit.
Low carbo, creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied and a creamy texture.
Strange but tasty and very easy drinkable, though it has some complex tones, strange, but not bad at all.","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"

Beer number two was a unique style that is also one of the main reasons I traveled all the way to Belgium. Its hard to pin down beers like this as there are not that many in the wild. Still, to try it side by side with the final product gave some insight into the transformation that takes place with time.

Aroma / Appearance - The flat bronze body had no true head or carbonation but was also a bit murky. The smell of a young scotch that has just taken on a sweet edge rises from the glass along with polished bronze doorknobs. Caramel undertones glue it together.

Flavor / Palate - Sherry and sweet caramel taste like drinking some sort of dessert wine. The heavy mouthfeel clings to the mouths corners. The finish might be short lived but adds a sugary bite. I wouldnt want to drink this all the time yet it is an experience that everyone should have at least once.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The glass brought to me was murky, cloudy and hazy soft orange amber with a one inch white fluffy head (see pic above, thats the one).

Acidity level is medium but still it strikes the tongue with tenacity... exceptionally vibrant raw grain, sweet malt, sour, funky cheese and barnyard... the yeast is just downright amazing.  Incredibly delicious, and hands down the best pure unblended Ive ever had.  I sampled the oude version (1-2 years) at the Weekend of Spontaneous Fermentation as well and it was clear and still and lacked the depth and pungency of the jonge...

Flavor is nicely acidic, yet still has a bit of sweetness, but that fresh wort is only in the nose so that has gone- good farmhouse and cheesy breett funk with a nice lactici sourness in the end some mildewy woody corkiness that I get from cantillon spongy cork.
