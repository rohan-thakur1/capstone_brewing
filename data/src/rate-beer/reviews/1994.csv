The pour is a dirtier dark brown color with a thicker khaki colored head and a couple spots of lace as it falls down to a thin ring. The aroma is very green peppery. The coffee on it is sharp and acidic. There is a malty sweetness to it and a that acidity. The green pepper is huge. The flavor is much of the same. The pepper doesnt do it for me. I thought this should fade with time, but damn. The mouth feel is a little more watery and thin with a decent carbonation and a sharp acidic coffee and pepper on the finish.

Thanks, Sam!

Had been wanting to try this one for a long time and was lucky enough to get a can from Sam. Big Surly fan and big coffee beer fan. Looking back I gave Bender a 3.88 back in the summer of 2011 but I was just starting my reviewing process then. Have some high hopes here.

Poured a dark-to-light black brown color with two fingers of khaki tan frothy head. Could see a few bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Bad watery spotty lacing. Poor retention. (Sight - 2.50)

Smelled bitter coffee beans, roasty malts, bitter dark chocolate, espresso, slight char wood, burnt molasses and ashtray. For the style and type of beer, nailed it. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste followed the nose almost exactly. Probably had this a tad too cold. Got roasted bitter coffee malts, dark espresso, mocha, char wood, ashtray, burnt molasses, licorice, toasted toffee and hints or dark caramel. (Taste - 4.50)

Medium body. Oily-to-creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, bitter, roasty finish. (Feel - 4.25)

Loved this one. No hiding it and a great name. I really need to start drinking coffee. (Overall - 4.50)

1994,"2016-02-22",4.3,"COD 11/20/15. Pours a rich dark brown, almost as dark as a stout. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

World class nose of rich coffee - fresh brewed medium roast that is not stale or over roasted. Underneath is a mere hint of chocolate malt.

Light body that is smooth. Superb carbonation that delivers a fair burst of effervescence in the middle and a strong prickly punch in the finish.

The taste profile is not complex but is quite outstanding. It delivers what it was designed to do, rich iced coffee flavor over a subtle malt base. As stated, this is coffee forward but it is also perfectly balanced. Coffee flows throughout the tasting experience with the middle being the transition point for the other flavors. Here, a very mild roast like bitterness emerges that is buttressed by subtle notes of caramel and chocolate. These flavors persist throughout the slowing fading finish.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

1994,"2016-01-25",3.7,"Surly főzetet elcsípni sem a legunalmasabb dolgok közé tartozik, amit egy sörissza elképzelhet magának, ez esetben pedig kávéval főzött sörről van szó, az élénkítő hatás tehát már csak emiatt is garantált. Ez utóbbi tulajdonságát kár is lenne tagadnia, az őrölt, pörkölt kávé jelenléte ugyanis ott munkálkodik mind színében - mely a fény felé tartva azért borostyán árnyalatokat is megcsillant -, mind illatában, ami bármely kereskedelmi forgalomban kapható kávé tasakjában megállná a helyét. Pörkölt, világos földes aromáit természetesen eszpresszós zamatok követik, ahogyan arra az alkoholtartalom tudatában számítani is lehet, könnyed, kevésbé testes, cseppet vizes és átérezhetően pörkölt malátás szerkezetben. A lecsengése kiegyensúlyozott, hosszú utóízt produkáló.

Flavor comes in with, SURPRISE, big coffee, earthy and spicy as can be and nearly like liquid espresso beans. There is a light nutty and malt character mixed in there but it is certainly subdued. There is a small hint of bittering cocoa powder as well. The mouthfeel on this is on the thin side and it would have been nice to have either a bit more thickness to this, or more carbonation. As is, the carbonation is a low medium to low. It makes it sort of sit deadened on the tongue. Nevertheless the coffee flavor here is massive and this is rather enjoyable.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

Taste follows the nose. Tastes like a more carbonated black iced coffee with a moderate to high bitterness as far as coffee beers goes. I am not going to say this is a bad thing. I dig coffee. I am not sure where the Brown base is at. Maybe hidden underneath the intense coffee is a little nuttiness, but I couldnt quite grasp it.

Overall, I dont think I have ever had a beer that has this much coffee flavor. If I tasted this blindly without knowing I was drinking a beer, I would not recognize it as such. I would classify this as a specialty beer for coffee lovers. Maybe I will swap out my morning coffee for this on weekday mornings working for the man.","Illinois, USA","xdtfx"
1994,"2013-07-23",3.5,"Can from Als shop on Conn Ave in DC. Pours mid-to-dark brown, little bit of visible foam, but mostly a sparkly carbonation rising to the surface. Aroma is all coffee with just a touch of earthy malt and sweet chocolate undertones. 

Taste is straight coffee, then some more coffee, and then a little dark roasty malts and light biscuit flavors, then some more coffee. 

Body is overall a little light for my taste, but if you were gonna dress a brown ale up, using coffee or souring it would be the way to go.

Taste is the same, with the roasted coffee taking the forefront and the malt following up. Noticed some nuttiness. Only a slight bitterness. Not at all vegetal like other coffee ales. Medium mouthfeel and body. Excellent brown ale, but if you aren't fond of coffee this isn't for you.

1994,"2013-06-12",4.0,"Rich, coffee-heavy, with modest accents of caramel, burnt toast, and roasted barley, this is a good breakfast beer or after-dinner drink. The coffee is, however, overly strong and creates a somewhat limited range of flavors and aromas, rendering the beer somewhat one-dimensional. I would probably not seek this out again given the difficulty in obtaining it - its easier to just make a dark cup of coffee and add some sweetener and ice.
Pours a 2.5cm tall head of beige foam, small to medium sized bubbles, with above average retention, lasting over two minutes as it fades to a thick ring around the glass with a thin residual head resting atop the body. Good lacing, in many patterns. Body is a transparent, deep amber color, light bringing out strong red hues. Carbonation is visible rising from the bottom of the glass in moderate number and velocity.
Aroma of coffee grounds, slight chocolate-caramel malt influences, and an iron-like scent rounding things out. Theres truth in the name here: there is definitely coffee in this beer, but the exclusion of much else. To me, it comes across as a bit one-dimensional.
Tasting opens with sweetish coffee, black with a substantial sweetness and touch of cream to it, somewhat stale. Mild roasted barley, burnt toast, and vanilla round out the edges. Mid-palate is like black coffee and grounds, acrid bitterness, light cumin, roasted barley, and burnt toast. Back of palate finds more black coffee, coffee grounds, acridness from coffee, light chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Aftertaste of black coffee with marginal chocolate and caramel malt.
Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a mouthfeel of light foam and general smoothness. Closes with medium dryness and astringency from coffee, with little residual stickiness.","Wyoming, USA","tibicinoid"

1994,"2013-02-19",3.9,"Ive had plenty of coffee stouts before, but never a coffee-infused brown ale. Would that even work? In the case of Surly Coffee Bender it definitely does. Its not as rich and intense as a coffee stout, but is just as robust, yet it has the smaller, more sessionable body of a brown ale. Impressive indeed.

I received a 16oz can from a fan in Minnesota (thanks, James!). I poured it into a mug.

Appearance: Opaque dark chestnut brown body. Forms a fairly large, beige, foamy head which lingers and laces very well.

Smell: Strong coffee aroma as soon as the can is opened. Up close its like sticking your nose in a pot thats been sitting on a burner for way too long. Not much genuine beer scents, though.

Taste: Ive often described coffee beers as tasting like iced coffee with plenty of cream and sugar, but in the case of Surly Coffee Bender its more like deeply roasted, unflavored and slightly burnt coffee. In other words, its a pretty darn bitter brew. Right from the get-go this beer is bitter with a dry, slightly spicy hop character. Though technically a brown ale, there isnt much in the way of traditional brown ale sweetness aside from a quick confectionery taste through the middle. The back end and aftertaste is all unflavored coffee. It imparts a dry bitterness and a taste akin to burnt popcorn.

But despite that description, the fact remains I actually really like the taste here. As a coffee drinker, but not a connoisseur, I do enjoy the robust, authentic coffee flavor. I also appreciate the originality of the recipe since it doesnt taste like mocha or iced coffee. And though its bitter its nothing unbearable. I would like to see more genuine malty sweetness to balance it out, but as it stands its more than a solid beer.

Drinkability: Surly Coffee Bender may not taste like a brown ale, but it definitely drinks like one. The mouthfeel is smooth, soft and low on the carbonation. It doesnt feel thick or heavy. Theres a mild coffee aftertaste, but its not only tolerable but pleasant. I am absolutely amazed that this beer is only 5.1% ABV considering how flavorful it is. Its something you can drink multiple servings of without being overwhelmed or suffering palate fatigue.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Live tasting, can into Duvel Tulip... Huge thanks to OtisCampbell for this!! 

Appearance; pours a dark, maduro cigar colored brown, with a two finger khaki colored head... Retention is moderate, and the head dissipates over a couple minutes to a thin ring around the glass... Lacing is pretty good, with patches of lace on the glass.

Smell; Smell is pretty mild, some slight coffee aromas, and a slightly bready, yeasty presence... Nothing extraordinary, but certainly not bad...

Taste; a great coffee flavor without any of the associated acidity or bitterness. The coffee kind of ""sits on"" the beer, and by that I mean it is the first flavor that pops right out, and as it gently fades out, a great , slightly nutty, bready brown shines through... The way the flavors meld together is wonderfully complex and it is perfectly balanced.

Mouthfeel; medium bodied with medium carbonation... Drinkability is superb at a touch over 5% ABV, it goes down extremely smooth... I could drink this all day.

Overall; probably the best brown Ive ever had... Drinkability is superb, flavors are outstanding... Definitely a winner from Surly and I would drink this daily if I could... I also think it would make one hell of a beer bread...","Missouri, USA","Thingus"

S: Smells of wood, nuts and malts. The coffee comes through just slightly in the end in a bitter ground fashion. Slightly disappointing as I expected more of the coffee upfront.

T: Theres the coffee I was looking for. I taste some mocha and vanilla with a slight hint of chocolate. Nice bitter coffee grounds with a toasted malt at the backend. This tastes like a nice iced coffee.

1994,"2012-05-01",3.6,"Originally reviewed: 4/21/10. Poured into a pint glass for a mid-morning drink. Its got coffee in it, this early is acceptable, no? 

Pours a cloudy dark brown with a massive tan head billowing out. Excellent retention on this one. Left lots of sticky globs and webbing all over the glass. The nose is not as coffee-forward as the can would lead you to believe. Im getting notes of honey, brown sugar, maple syrup and bread. Just the faintest of coffee scents on the backend. A little disappointing to say the least. Still, it smells great. 

The body is thinner than Id like as well. Compared to the regular Bender, this one is lacking in bite and depth. Maybe the coffee plays a part(?). The flavor as well is lacking the big bold coffee presence I was expecting. This beer carries the common characteristics to most browns: a nice bready flavor, some toasted brown sugar, light bitterness. There is a lightly sour note present. Coffee? Not sure. Some mild roasted aftertaste which I can assume is from the coffee added. 

I kept the score a little higher on the flavor, because though it lacked the coffee I was expecting, this still was a damn good brown. Better than many. Id have another, and even another. But they could ""bold"" it up a bit more IMO.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

1994,"2012-03-01",3.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/22/2011.  Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass.

This looks pretty much exactly the same as Bender, although a bit darker. A walnut brown color with a ruby tint around the borders of the glass. A frothy tan head forms initially, retains pretty well, and leaves sticky lace on the sides of the glass.

I have not had coffee from the Vinca Vista Hermosa plantation in Guatemala, but the aroma is overwhelmingly Dunkin Donuts coffee at first. The coffee is bold and aromatic. The original aroma of burnt sugar, hazelnut, and earthy hops is largely cast aside.

The flavor maintains a brown sugar front, with some toasted malt and hazelnut as well, but the coffee is already there. The flavor turns coffee bitter, with some earthy hops barely squeezing their way through. The finish is more coffee.

The mouthfeel of Coffee Bender gets a step up over Bender. A little creamier, although there is still that lingering graininess that I dont care for. The carbonation is tighter, but still at a medium level. The body is a bit fuller, maybe slightly above medium.

One of the few times I dont think coffee makes a beer better. I find it a little bit overwhelming, especially in the aroma. Maybe it was the type of coffee that I just did not connect with.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Bit of a gritty and chalky palate.  Lingering dark roasted grains and coffee flavor.  A bit too much coffee for my tastes.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

S: This is a unique beer. Unlike most coffee infused beers, this doesnt come across as roasted or burnt coffee. Instead, it is straight freshly ground coffee beans. Take some fresh ground coffee and rub it between your fingers right under your nose, and thats the smell of the Coffee Bender. Light caramel, toffee and nutty malts are in the background.

T: The fresh ground aroma doesnt translate as well to the flavor profile. By no means is it bad. It just loses that ""freshness"" of the coffee. The coffee is more of a roasted flavor here, and the malts shine through nicely.

M: Smooth, medium bodied. Lingering aftertaste. Solid carbonation from the can.

O: A very nice, if not unique, brew that anyone who enjoys a little coffee in their beer should take a chance on.

Dark brown. Imagine a strong coffee with a tiny splash of chocolate milk and youre probably getting close. A good sized head, very tan, which fades away very very slowly. Beautiful in the glass.

Smell:
Coffee dominates with malt taste falling in behind it. The coffee aroma prevents you from noticing anything specific about the hops. 

Taste: 
Coffee again is the dominating factor. The bitterness is more like hops than coffee though, which is interesting. A lot of the flavors that come out in the normal Bender are drowned out by the coffee, except for some possible chocolate notes.

Mouthfeel:
Thick, creamy, and smooth. It makes you feel almost like youre drinking an iced coffee with a bit of cream, though the flavor goes pretty quick. Not that I mind picking up the glass to take another sip.

The aroma is combination of wood and coffee, but despite these two normally dominating aromas the aroma overall is pretty light.

The taste is very light and somewhat disappointing because it is pretty flavorless. If it wasnt called coffee bender I wouldnt even think of coffee and be able to pick any out of it. To me its tastes like a light fun of the mill brown ale.

4.0 S: Smells quite a bit like the original, with a coffee vibe added. Roastiness with a pleasant nuttiness to it. Coffee works well with the other aromas and doesnt detract. However, all the smells could be stronger.

4.5 T: Just like the regular, this is one hell of a brew. Nuttiness and roastiness found in the original mesh eloquently. Pretty simple, but it works marvelously. The addition of coffee only improves the beer. Flavorful, but not so much that the other flavors are less discernable.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body, closer to light. Good carbonation, creamy (but could be more so), and smooth as silk.

4.5 D: If the mouthfeel was a bit thicker, this would be pretty close to a perfect brown. The way it stands, its still very good and I could go through a number of these with no problem. Man do I love Surly brews.

After lurking for a month in the back of the fridge I cracked one of two cans open on a steaming hot afternoon. It not only hit the spot it made me wish I had not given two away. Well rounded, easy on the palate, and not too boozy that you could not have a few without wrecking the palate, this is the perfect summer / early fall drink. If Surly was ever in Ohio I would definitely be recommending it to people (and not just because of things like Darkness and Smoke).

Aroma / Appearance - Carbonated, the black body is offset by lively bubbles that force pockets of flavor to the surface. Strong black coffee wakes up even the dullest senses along with malts and other rich aspects that are somewhat masked. This is not subtle in the least about the ""coffee"" part of the title.

Flavor / Palate - Black coffee, dark chocolate, and an intense malty finish had me checking the label to make sure this was only 5% ABV. Very strong, balanced, and flavorful this is not a mild or meek beer. Like a toned down version of Breakfast Stout with all the same characteristics it has become one of my favorite brown ales after only a single tasting. I know what I will be getting if I see it on tap in the Minneapolis region.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The taste was actually pretty weak in the coffee dept. I got the malt but it was off and funky, a little metalic grape taste came through too. The body was really light and watery. This feels like a cross between a stale Newcastle and an old guinness out of the bottle with some used coffee grounds mixed in. Maybe Ive got a bad can- I would love to give this another shot but Im only going out on that limb if its on tap.

Medium body: average carbonation, moderately creamy, non-astringent; Im not usually the biggest fan of coffee beers, and the character here is much closer to an iced, milky coffee character than the heavily roasted presence in other beers, but this presence works great for the Bender base: milky iced coffee, caramel, very light roast, and lots of lightly bitter chocolate; almost a milky, iced presence overall, with a very solid, moderately hopped (minerals, mostly; much of the bitterness comes through from the coffee and specialty malts) brown ale core; Ive always been a huge fan of bender, and while I generally prefer the base beer, this is a pretty lovely rendition as well; nicely handled.

1994,"2010-01-24",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Biscuity and nutty coffee wealth dwells in a beautifully cushy mouthfeel, ending up in a light roasted malt bitterness for a very convincing Coffee Brown Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the ruby-laced brown.
-Even though the coffee flavors are upfront, they blend in wisely with the grain bill.
-The overall flavor profile is more complex than, say, Cigar Citys Espresso Maduro Brown Ale.
-That mouthfeel is something else. These guys are really impressive.

Ive liked this beer since my first, but I never really thought that hard about how it worked until this rating.

The regular bender is a good beer, but I think this trumps it.  The coffee is very strong in the nose which is a smell I love so that certainly intriques me and the coffee is definitely highly prevalent in the taste as well.  And Im not talking coffee malts or any of that shit, actual real coffee flavors up in this brew and its quite enticing.

Sweet, quite alcoholic with a good caffeine kick. Sourish finish. This would be a great way to start the day and I bet its a good pick-me-up after a night on the sauce. Another impressive Surly.

Flavor follows aroma leaning more towards the hoppy side with lots of bitterness, floral and bright citrus, very bitter, medium brown sugar that isnt excessively sweet.

The flavor follows suit- roasty, with coffee leading the way and some vanilla, tobacco, and chocolate notes.  Medium bodied, and at first seems thin but then has a grittier mouthfeel later.

This beer is not any of those, it is a brown ale that is totaly over powered by the coffee. It could bee that Im sensetive to the coffee and dont find any malt or hops. For coffee lovers this must bee a much better beer than for me.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"

The taste is nutty and malty, with some bitter coffee and lactose coming through. Theres just enough hops on the finish to bitter it out and balance it a bit.

4/25/2009:  Surly Coffee Bender is probably better than I have given it credit, but its so hard to be truly objective about a beer when it follows not only a huge, deeply flavorful and rich Imperial Stout, but the second highest rated beer on the site?!  Needless to say, I would love to try Coffee Bender again, so please consider sending me a can or two if you have some to spare!  At any rate, this beer has a good coffee flavor all around and is balanced in everyway.  I like the bitterness and roasted quality that the ground coffee beans impart.

Appearance:  Opaque, dark reddish-orange-brown head that is frothy, ivory-colored, and lasting; detailed lacing marks top to bottom.

On the palate it finishes a bit chalky, which leads me to think they have water profile issues or the high level of coffee has taken its toll on the acidity of the beer or something. Anyway, it just isnt quite right. I think this might have been a better beer had the coffee been a little less present and the beer a little more present. Not once did this remind me of drinking beer, which seems wrong. Eventually my coffee connoisseur gag-reflex of good coffee gone cold kicked in and I couldnt drink anymore.

1994,"2009-04-11",3.4,"Can courtesy of theisti. Thanks Tim. It pours deep clear brown, almost mahogany, with a large, creamy, beige head that laces nicely. The nose is initially all about the coffee, then your brain toggles back and forth trying to hone-in on just what its smelling...hops, coffee, perhaps chicory coffee...something is just a bit ""off"". You circle around it never settling on one definitive aroma. I guess the best way to describe it would be to say that it smells like an iced coffee with ""something"" else added to it. That something is earthy and herbal but I cant lock down a specific descriptor. The mouthfeel is fairly light-bodied yet creamy and slick with a punch of hop bitterness coming at the end. (It is a Surly beer...) The flavor is of coffee over a round malty body, concluding with a nice hoppy bitterness. Notes of coffee and hops linger long after the swallow. Overall...this is an odd bird. Its more-or-less all over the place, and although I really like certain qualities it possesses (the mouthfeel and nice bitterness), it lacks the continuity to make me want more.

Pour is mostly clear mahogany dark brown with pretty settling that builds up a thick and lasting 3 inch light tan head. Aroma of somewhat stale coffee, pine hoppiness and roasted malt. Nice enough, though this was a pretty blah coffee nose. Taste is very much the coffee aromatics and taste at the beginning, middle is the brown ale of Bender with a pine hop bitterness to the finish. The hops are pretty understated, and the coffee dominates throughout. I didnt mind the concept of this beer, but it really suffered from a flat, dull coffee profile. Not sure what technique they used to extract the coffee, but it ended up tasting almost like instant coffee. Palate is creamy medium, coats the mouth nicely. The finish is quite long, and features even more of the coffee.  Having said all of this, it is still a clean beer that is easy to sip, just a little dull.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

this poured a chestnut-y brown... im gonna go with a shade darker than the regular bender and a creamy tannish head. 

if i smelled this blind i wouldve told you it was stale coffee. crazy... aromas of whole medium dark roasted beans beans, brown sugar, toasted nuts and vanilla. im amazed by the sheer volume of real coffee stink coming off of this thing!

awww, the flavor is a bit of a let down. not bad, just not very... esoteric... a cold cup of mildly sour coffee with notes of brown sugar, faint chocolate and some nuttiness with a very bitter dry finish. theres just not a whole lot happening. its damn good just a bit too simple and straight forward. it is medium bodied with a nice creamy mouth feel.

This is more of a nut-brown ale than a stout.  Smell is coffee, plain and simple, with mild nuttiness.  Mouth is light with normal carbonation.

The coffee is somehow infused in the beer; it’s not so much a flavor in the beer, but rather a part of the beer.  It sounds weird, but I love the way it marries with the other flavors,and actually makes the other flavors stand out more!  My biggest negative with this beer is the mouthfeel and appearance which really go hand in hand.  It is much too thin, much to carbonated, and lacks the characteristics I enjoy with this flavor profile.","Crestwood, Illinois, USA","JLAudio"

Tiny hop presence appears towards the finish and gives some balance but the finish is mostly bitter rye malty. Medium body and lively carbonation.

Aromas are coffee and grainy malt, reminiscent of the brewhouse at Flossmoor Station. The coffee dominates this brew, with the malt profile sweetness shining through in spurts and some nice touches of hops. As I have never had regular Bender, I cannot compare it as such.

The flavor is roughly the same.  There’s a little bit of forgiveness from the coffee there, but mostly it’s just coffee.  The only real weakness is that the body is a bit disappointingly thin.

A heavily hopped and easily drinkable brown ale where the coffee just extends its roasty arm. 

I like:
Its deep brown shade fitted the Delilahs bar where I had it. Malty but not thick. Well roasted nutty ale. The coffee ends up feeling perhaps a bit beany, but its generally well-blended. The roast and hops mixture offers a fair bit of acidity, but not in excess.

I dislike:
The small white head quickly departs from the clear light amber pour. A certain huskiness coats the palate. I quickly grew tired of my pint, which should not happen with a lager.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The roast/coffee comes on strong and leads to the nutty, chocolate, and earthy hops.

Could be the  lack of attention to proper beer glass detergent from a coffee-centric establishment. Murky dark red body. Tastes a bit like flavored iced coffee with alcohol. Not sure how my thirstyness from working out just prior is playing into my enjoyment of this brew, but I cant have enough of it.

Im a big fan of coffee and this was spot on with both the aroma and taste. After trying this several times, I have found that there is little to no complexity displayed in this beer.  I have also realized after drinking better coffee more often, that this beer is nowhere close to tasting like a quality coffee, and its chock full of charred flavors.  Theres a bit of chocolate and some walnut, but thats about it.   After another can, I have found the aroma to be quite insufferable, and it smells a lot like a slough on a late September morning.

1994,"2007-08-16",3.8,"Some beers are better left alone to be enjoyed as the brewer created them. Some beers become awesome when tons of coffee is dumped into them! The body is murky and dark brown with soft burgundy hues. A mid-sized tan head is very well retained, still present as the last sip dissapears. The aroma is just screaming with fresh coffee. Lesser notes of caramel malt, brown sugar, nuts, fruits(grapefruit, orange) and cocoa. The flavor is so lovable! The coffee and hops create a formidable bitterness that fortunately only releases a very mild acidity and a mild astringency. Sweetness is medium-high, never cumbersome or remotely cloying. The finish is loaded with coffee, grain and cocoa, of lengthy duration, semi-sweet and heavily bitter. Medium-bodied, highly though pleasantly carbonated, decently smooth. Though the mouthfeel was nothing memorable, the flavor kept me coming back for more the entire afternoon I spent at Surly. Great concoction.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The cold toddy really stood out in the aroma.. a nice coffee in there, but it went a bit too far in masking the chewy, nutty goodness beneath.. some nutty notes and cocoa did peek through, but the coffee stole the show.  The flavor was not unlike a fine iced coffee.. some drier chocolates and caramel came through on the middle, and the finish reverted back to the coffee.. the long bitter coffee finish was a bit too drawn out for my liking.  Medium-bodied and a bit too heavily skewed toward the coffee flavors and bitterness.  Solid brew overall, but a bit too focused on the coffee addition.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Grown by the Martinez family.
Full City roast by Coffee &Tea Ltd.,Linden Hills,Minneapolis)

Solid ebon color, browish at bottom, with a beautifully hued head, a deep cocoa tan looking for all the world like a shot of espresso, with a generous dollop of froth.

Aromas where its at, wide open and long-lastin, rich with coffee, with a hint of cream. 
Herbal, nutty, chocolatey, brimming with coffee essence. A treat to drink in with the nose.

But now lets let the lips and tongue go to work. More delights. The coffee has overpowered the subtler parts of Benders character, but theres no sorrow in this, as the coffee flavor that controls it now is an exceptional playmate for the palate. Really sticks to the tongue and lays long in the finish.

Medium to full body, long, coffee-tinged finish, unflinchingly flavorful, and still an easy treat to drink down. This has met with near unanimous praise among those Ive witness enjoy it, and I can only hope its attempted again and again, so that more may discover this jolt of joy for java freaks, and beer geeks alike.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
