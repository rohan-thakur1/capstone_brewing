2990,"2017-06-18",2.7,"Bought this particular can of Hard Pineapple at the local grocery store. Never really smelled it until now, I would say it smells sweet. Drink it from the can, of course, brown bag optional, yes to the bag this go around. The taste is a metallic, hard-candy sweetness and there is pineapple in there. There is a time and a place for a brew like this. For me it is Sunday afternoon following a weekend of yard work, thank you very much.","Midland, Texas, USA","KevinReddirt"

2990,"2016-08-24",2.5,"24oz can pours, chilled down to near freezing, with a hazy pale neon lime gold that supported a 5 second ring of foam. The aroma offers up Kool Aid lime, thin candied pineapple and then honey drizzled apple wedges. The taste delivers an initial soft apple and honey like sweetness. It then slides into candy lime and thin pineapple juice. Not too hateful as the juiciness pulls a blanket over most of the apple and pear like esters. But . . . it isnt long before it becomes too damn sweet.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2990,"2016-07-02",2.8,"24 oz can after a sucky day at my even more sucky job. Why am I always drawn to these on days like today.Pours a Mt. Dew yellow/green. Maybe a smidge more green than yellow.. I had a white head on this. About half finger, no retention of course. No lacing.Aroma is pineapple. Reminds me of pineapple soda. Or pineapple sherbert. Or pineapple yogurt. Or even pineapple juice.Tastes more like the syrup from a can of pineapple. Its quite sticky sweet. Its pretty good.Mouthfeel is medium to full, because it does have so much sugar in it. So heavy and sweet. Tasty nonetheless.Overall, I feel better now knowing that Ive had my fruit for the day. Ask me, and Ill say I had a whole pineapple, by myself. And I did, except it wasnt an actuual fruit, it was a...beverage. For a beer, its bad. Bud for an alcopop, its outstanding.Also, have you ever read food labels that say, ""May contain traces of peanuts"" or whatever. This is similar, the label might read ""May contain traces of alcohol."" I mean, I cant taste it at all.I hate my job!!","Arkansas, USA","beer_rookie"

2990,"2016-01-29",2.8,"Can, shared by me... in my dining room... just now.
What is this before me that appears like an overly hazy glass of Mountain Dew? If this does not tickle my innards, there shall be hell to pay.

Now I cant say as though Ive ever smelled, or even tasted a pineapple soda, but I do imagine this here is about as close as Ive gotten. The aroma is very sweet with lots of pineapple... but then the light corniness and booziness peak through, reminding you that at the core of this beast is one of the classic malt liquors of the 21st century. 

The flavor is something else, like those pineapple candies, with some fruit punch (the kind with the frozen pineapple juice ring), just a little bit of that classic ""not quite gasoline"" Steel Reserve alcohol character and just the tiniest bit of corn and grape drink! Its tart & remarkably sweet, it is not good but hell De Troch has done far worse. 

The palate is about a medium to heavy bodied mouthfeel with a soda like carbonation and just enough alcohol burn in the finish to pull it all off. 

Its not quite the instant classic of the fruited malt liquor world that BLK Berry was, but it is on all accounts not far off.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

It is maybe a little too sweet to be really drinkable but, then again, there are people who drink soda all damn day so I guess that does not disqualify this stuff from being drinkable.

2990,"2015-08-23",2.2,"Poured a bright yellow, almost looked like Mountain Dew, with a light fizzy head that dwindled to almost nothing. Sweet aroma of fruit/pineapple. Taste is very sweet pineapple with very slight malt/grain background with next to no real hoppiness. Palate is fairly thin. Decent thirst quencher if you are in a hot summertime situation. I liked it better when I diluted it 1:1 with a light pale lager - cut down the sweetness while maintaining the overall flavor.","Town of Maple Creek, Wisconsin, USA","dekester1"

A lot of sugary sweetness, but by a wide margin this has to be my favorite of the 4 Alloy Series variants. Big sugary pineapple. Ridiculous neon green-yellow color. Minimal off-white head.
