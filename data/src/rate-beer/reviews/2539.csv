2539,"2011-03-02",3.4,"50cL bottle, courtesy of blomster. Thanks, Christer! Really excited to try this and the other 2.8% beer he brought over. Pours a bright, medium golden-straw color; high clarity; thin, fine-bubbled white head with light retention and lacing. Soft, rounded presence of Maris Otter malts in the aroma, along with a very light citrus hoppiness; balanced and crisp; the malt aromas pop, and the whole effect is a touch like fresh tea. Light to medium-light body; pretty high carbonation. Really nice presentation in the mouth, with only a touch of wateriness (generally filled out); modest levels of, again, Maris Otter maltiness and some zesty citrus and earthy hop bitterness and flavor (more pronounced than the aroma hints at); a touch of a crystalline sugar character, along with a slight tea-like texture that remains non-astringent; some really nice, well-integrated hop flavor comes through: citrus, floral notes. Hugely drinkable, and well handled. Medium-length finish showing pronounced toastiness and a bit of citrus bitterness lingering; nicely dry. I could drink this all day.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Aroma is grassy malts and hops, very earthy and fresh smelling.  Flavor is thin, but for a low alcohol beer this has surprisingly good flavor.  Grassy grains, straw and dried grass with clean almost peppery hops.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","fata2683"

2539,"2010-08-26",3.7,"50 c bottle from ICA Maxi, MölndalBB 2010-12-08, tried on August 26, 2010Clear golden color, fluffy white lasting head. Nice fresh, sweet, hoppy, fruity, floral, goose berry scent. Malty, dry, thinish, grainy, harsh, fruity, hoppy taste. One of the better 2.8% Swedish beers Ive tasted for sure. Still could have sweeter taste, or rather more residual sweetness, for my personal taste hat is. A bit under medium mouthfeel, though more than OK fo this low alcohol. Not going even close to thin. Medium bitterness, though to the dry side. Fruity and dry, mineral like, aftertaste.Get it while you can!","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
