925,"2016-04-02",3.1,"On draft at the brewery (which, although the tasting room is a tent in a parking lot, is worth a visit). Pour is orange brown, medium carbonation. Nose is bready, touch of caramel. Taste is fruity and bitter, bread crust, orange. Pleasantly chewy mouthfeel. Pretty true to style. Nice.","","kespecial"
925,"2013-12-22",3.6,"On tap at some random kegger in Oakland. Nice beer, its got some hearty grains and some good orangey hoppiness. Tastes like it might have rye in it, that sort of tart chewiness.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
925,"2013-03-30",3.6,"Pours a slightly hazy orange-golden with a soapy white head. Asymmetrical lacing around the edges as the head dissipates. Some green grape and unripe banana. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel with very little carbonation. Clean flavor with some tart fruit that gets accentuated by the hop character at the finish.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"

Bitter floral fruity aftertaste with perfumy grainy notes. Nice. Typical SF taste profile to it. (0.5l draft, Beer Revolution, Oakland.)","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"

925,"2010-06-06",3.5,"Draft, Beer Revolution.  A touch grainy but otherwise rather good for the style and quite refreshing.  Mild light caramel/bready malt.  Lightly grassy/citric/floral hops.  Mild bitterness.  Nice dry yeastiness in the finish.  A well made beer, simple and satisfying.  Listed as 5 or 5.5% abv.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
925,"2009-10-14",3.5,"Pours golden hazy orange with a white head. The aroma is fruity. Mostly tropical with mango and papaya. The flavor is sweet with caramel and fruit and an herbal bitter finish. Pretty flavorful for a low alcohol session beer.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
925,"2009-08-07",4.4,"Infinitely more complex version of Anchors Steam.  The yeast in suspension leads to a slightly different taste each time I encounter it.  The lingering taste of the slightly sweet/tart malt and the Northern brewer hops are, in my opinion, the best part of the beer.",", California, USA","Bomberbeer"
925,"2009-07-03",3.2,"On tap at the Brewing Network Anniversary party @ Linden St. Poured a deep gold. Nose was bready, sweet malt, grainy, floral hops. Flavor was biscuity, some hop bite, fruity malts, bubble gum. Medium body. Decent example of a not so popular style.","Alaska, USA","gkost"
925,"2008-04-20",3.6,"Poured at FIrkin Fest at Triple Rock, golden with small white head.  Aromas of mild grass and malted grain.  The flavor is a kind of toasted malt with some grassy, and fruity malt notes.  More of a hop bite to it than Anchor Steam, but very mild.  There is a malty full mouthfeel  that has some slight astringent notes in the middle but a nice dry clean finish.  Easy drinking beer.  Ill be trying it again.","El Cerrito, California, USA","rayOfBeer"
925,"2008-01-08",3.5,"This California Common pours a medium orange gold from tap. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is malty and sweet, with a touch of floral hops. A medium bodied steam beer. The malts are fruity and sweet. The hops are grapefruity and floral. It very hoppy for a California Common, but I like it. It still has that nice soft round feel of a steam beer, but has a nice hop bite to it.  Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
