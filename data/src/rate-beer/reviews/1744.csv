1744,"2011-08-13",3.2,"Many thanks for my lovely wife to noticing Total Tap Takeover at Tap and Mallet tonight.  For whatever reason, I could get nothing out of this aroma wise, in case it was me, I am giving it 5/10.  Appearance is a handsome amber / light orange. Funky sour, spicy, malty.  Tasty unusual and good.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"

1744,"2010-12-11",3.8,"Tap at RNH.  Pours a nice bright clear copper with a thin white head- nice lace.  Aroma is light doughy yeasty notes almost getting a whiff of fresh bread with a slight chlorine hint- bready nutty hint of roast, and clean light herbal hops.  Flavor is toast, biscuit, nuts, light roast and sweet hint of chocolate, light caramel and big cara toasted malts- Vienna and caramunich.  a touch sweet and flabby in the middle but finishes dry and clean.  Not as refined as it could be but this is still pretty good overall.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1744,"2010-12-11",3.0,"On tap @ Rattle N Hum.
Orange/gold and clear with barely any head. Fairly light aroma with a bit of caramel and malt. A bit more taste than I was expecting given the weak aroma, some bready malts come out on the palate, and a bit of toast. Nothing special, but crisp and refreshing.","New York, New York, USA","murphym45"
1744,"2010-12-09",3.1,"On tap at Rattle n Hum with Steph.   Color looked good for the style.. dark copper.  Nothing worth going out of your way for... Brooklyn Lager is probably better.   Kind of like your run of the mill lager but with a fuller body, caramel with an slight tang, and sharper finish.","Manhattan, New York, USA","Pwn3d"
