3724,"2016-04-24",3.1,"On tap at Plutos in Davis. Pours a clear amber with moderate off white head. Taste and aroma are moderate caramel and slight floral aspects in the flavor. Everything seemed a little toned down here. Not bad.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
3724,"2016-01-26",3.6,"Pleasant malty aroma of bread, toffee, light hop woodiness 
Pours an amberish copper color with creamy lasting off white head
Malty flavor, bread toffee and a decent amount of roast, woody hop.
Medium bodied, medium high co2, lasting bittersweet finish. 
Very nice amber ale. Well balanced and interesting enough to keep drinking more

3724,"2015-04-07",3.2,"Smells of red malt and bread, taste is both those (particularly big and bready) but with just enough hopping to provide a nice, crispy grapefruity dry finish. Not complex or mind-blowing, but a very nicely done Irish Red, for sure. Very drinkable.","California, USA","fezzy"
3724,"2015-04-02",2.5,"22 oz bottle poured into a tulip. Trade from a Sacramento friend, thanks Ed! Hazy dark amber with billowing 3-4 fingers of beige head. Aromas of dark fruit, malt, light biscuit/toast. Tastes of toast, biscuit, some dark fruit and malt. Medium-light body with a dry finish. Seems a bit off.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
3724,"2014-08-29",2.5,"Labeled as an Irish red at their brewery, not as an amber ale as listed in places. I found this brewer to be completely underwhelming. This beer was true to the style, which was more than I can say for a few of the others, but utterly forgettable.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

3724,"2013-11-09",3.6,"Tap: dark amber pour with a small tan head. Aroma is soft with malt, a light toast and a liytle grain. Flavor is lightly sweet with malt turning into a tart grass hoppiness, bread and a grainy, yeast bitter finish. I like it with my meal, nice flavors but kind of filling.","El Cerrito, California, USA","rayOfBeer"
3724,"2013-10-10",3.3,"Bottle from Nugget in Davis, CA. Pours a dark amber color. Tastes of caramel and spice, with a hint of hop. Solid beer.","Winters, California, USA","DTM"
3724,"2013-09-20",3.7,"Poured a finger of head on a clear, caramel colored body.
The aroma is nice, but interesting for a red ale: chocolate and milk.
The taste is balanced: mild sweet caramel and mild bitterness. Quite drinkable.
The texture is smooth with moderate carbonation.
Pleasant.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
3724,"2013-08-19",3.0,"Pours tea color, nice malt sweetness/hop bitterness balance, finishes cleanly but without distinction. Just an okay expression of the amber ale style, not a great expression.","Corrales, New Mexico, USA","maltman53"
3724,"2013-08-18",3.5,"On tap @ American River. Pours dark red/brick color with an off-white head. Aromas of caramel, toast, and bread. Notes of grass and perfumey hops, maybe some orange peel. Nice caramel and toasted bread sweetness up front. Some bitterness of grassy hops. Floral and perfume notes, orange peel, and, cocoa powder.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3724,"2013-06-19",4.5,"A red that lives up to its name. Clear deep red color. Rich malty smells the malts come on first then the hops come on to balance it out.. Amazingly refreshing for how full the flavor is. Light and enjoyable aftertaste.","truckee, California, USA","krumbum"
3724,"2013-06-08",3.2,"On tap at Cullens Pub in Benicia, CA. Pretty good amber ale with some good maltiness.","California, USA","vvesside"
3724,"2013-05-10",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours reddish amber with a foamy off-white head and a bready aroma. There is a medium-bodied smoked malt flavor with a nice raspy finish that sticks to the palate.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
3724,"2013-03-03",3.5,"Tap at Capital Beerfest 2013. Pours ruddy amber with some beige bubbles. Med body. Sharp carb. Flavor is malty and hoppy. Tasty, but hard to pick out hop type.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
