3786,"2016-09-03",3.7,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is very malty with some moderate dark and dried fruit notes as well as a touch of alcohol. Fairly strong caramel, toffee and toasted bread notes with hints of chocolate and burnt sugar. Medium light notes of raisins and prunes. Medium light bourbon notes with a touch of oak and vanilla. Some light alcohol spice. Some banana esters as it warms. 
Pours a murky, muddy brown, with a medium sized, thick, tan head that slowly recedes to the edges where it lingers for a bit. No lacing and moderate legs. 
Flavor is moderately to very sweet with lots of caramel, toffee, toasted bread and burnt sugar. Hints of chocolate. Moderate bourbon notes with some light oak and and vanilla. Medium alcohol notes and medium light bitterness. Some light raisin and prune notes with more banana as it warms. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium to medium high alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer, but I wish it were a bit smaller. The alcohol is a bit strong and still somewhat hot. Otherwise, the malt character is great and works well with the barrel notes. Nice, complimentary fruit notes.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3786,"2016-08-24",3.2,"Bottle from the Bruery. Pours murky deep hazel with a medium tan head that dissipates leaving decent lacing and bubbles. Aroma is bourbon and vanilla forward, with rye bread and hints of clove. Flavor is pretty sweet, medium bitter. loads of bourbon, rye, clove, vanilla, a hint acidic and tannic. Medium body, not as hot as you might think, but still aggressive and harsh.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

3786,"2016-05-28",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2016 Bottle from Steve. Cash money! Although a bit dull in the pour, the rest of this beer rocks the house. Smooth for a 13% beer. Mildly sweet, but a real nice weizenbock.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
3786,"2016-03-15",3.7,"750 ml bottle. Deep brown color, thin bubbles of head. Aroma is a ton of bourbon vanilla, coconut flakes, and molasses. 
Flavor is full of bourbon. Like bourbon in force, mild warming alcohol after the swallow. The base weizen bock is very mild, almost cant be found in all this hot bourbon. Body is full and syrupy. Wow, burn","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

3786,"2016-01-18",3.6,"Pours a very dark brown with a one finger tan head Smells of bourbon and oak, along with soy and mollasses. There are some spices in there and maybe some banana and vanilla. However, the barrel dominates the beer. The taste is rather complex, there is a ton of malt, some coconut, bourbon, wood, spices, banana, with a warm finish. Its medium body but leaning towards the thick side. Low carbonation. Overall a unique beer with a lot of barrel. Not to bad.","South Gate, California, USA","toxichop"
3786,"2016-01-06",3.3,"The beer is a deep medium-dark brown. Cant quite tell if its hazy or not. Small beige head. Dissipates after a minute. No lacing, nothing left behind. The aroma is big on sweet malt and vanilla. Mild bubblegum, really just a hint. Its an almost perfumey extra light caramel note. Some molasses and brown sugar, once it warms up some. Taste is burnt sugars and barrel flavor. Its quite clean and not as simply sweet as the aroma suggested. Theres a mild umami flavor. Mouthfeel is thin and kinda oily. Overall, the beer is too clean and one note. Theres not enough malt body to back up the vanilla flavor. I guess theres some coconut and banana/bubblegum complexity to the taste, at least, but its just not working for me.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

3786,"2015-12-01",3.5,"Dark brown reddish in color... Aroma of bourbon, caramel, vanilla, wheat, banana... Flavor is kind of bland, thin bourbony base, wheat, caramel and vanilla notes, finishes with an ashy bourbon on palate... Underwhelming, but drinkable

3786,"2015-11-21",3.7,"Bottle. Muddy maroon hue with a fluffy tan head. Aroma leads with toasty bourbon, coconut, maple and vanilla, but theres also bananas flambé, dates and graham cracker. The flavors a little tangier, with fruity fig, raisin and banana merging with vanilla before a teriyaki finish. Body is thick and heavy, but the carbonation is lively with fizz. Much more complex as it warms.","","PartyFowle"
3786,"2015-11-04",3.4,"A- slightly murky Amber brown with a scattered egg shell white head. Minor lacing.

S- strong bourbon, raisins, banana bread, cheap chocolate, caramel malts, honey, pear, old ripe apple, sourdough, lemons and muddled citrus. 

M- good burn with a medium to full tacky body. Good carb.

T- basically the aromas again. Good bourdon, vanilla, and dried fruit sweetness. Not sure what else to add here. Maybe a little rhubarb too.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3786,"2015-11-02",4.1,"Draught at the tasting room in Placentia, California. Very dark brown beer with a small beige head. Fruity caramel aroma, toffee, figs, raisins, grapes, licorice, vanilla and cream notes. Malty fruity flavor, raisins, caramel, figs, banana notes, bourbon, some spices. Delicious but more of a quad or barley wine in my book.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"

3786,"2015-10-19",3.7,"Big n boozy, probably more than it needs to be. The beer is hidden under the house Bruery bourbon barrels. Sweet vanilla and bourbon, nice but starting to be a little common.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3786,"2015-10-13",3.4,"Bottle @ The Bruery. Dark chestnut colored pour with a khaki head. Big time bourbon and caramel here. Some vanilla, plenty of toast, and a bit of dark fruit. Slight spiciness of whiskey and charred oak as well. Theres a nice sweetness to the flavor and a big time raisin and plum quality. Nice sweet chocolate as well. Not bad, though certainly not terribly traditional.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
