167,"2016-08-16",3.8,"Danish porter brewed in Norway, intending to imitate the taste of Pumpernickel, a German type of rye bread. Fairly thin but stable, creamy, densely structured, pale beige head opening rapidly in the middle but retaining in a steady rim around the glass and a veil of tan foam in the middle; black robe with mahogany edges only visible under bright light. Spicy and bready aroma of dried plums, soggy rye bread, toast, strong presence of salmiak candy, bayleaf, old dry thyme, old grapefruit peel, leather, sage, dried black olives, bitter cocoa, dry earth, elderberry, juniper berries, pine wood, old cigars, dried tree leaves, black tea, roasted peanuts, hazelnut shells. Onset of dried fruits (fig, raisin) but very low in sweetness, much more dominated by dried seaweed- and cured meat-like umami with a soft background sourishness, softly carbonated, lightly oily and smooth mouthfeel, brief caramelly touch quickly turning toasted bitter with this spicy rye quality to it and eventually becoming very stout-like roasted bitter (but more in the sense of burnt toast than e.g. coffee), enhanced by a spicy, leafy, slightly resinous hop bitterness ensuring an aromatic, very dry, long aftertaste where it all comes together, including impressions of old dried juniper berries and dry red wine. Not sure how this mirrors Pumpernickel bread, but in any case this is a rich, interesting porter with enough black maltiness or roasted bitterness to qualify as a stout - a common phenomenon in modern craft beer culture. Very enjoyable.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
167,"2016-06-20",3.5,"Draft @ Bootleggers CPH // 10 cl tulip taster

Pours dark brown/black with a reasonably-sized tan head. Rye malt seems to dominate the aroma with hints to the rest of the malt profile and fennel/liquorice, but it seems like mostly sweet rye. The taste follows this pattern, and the beer does not have any appreciable hop presence in this respect either. A lot of people apparently like it, and it is really not bad, but it also appears quite gimmicky to me, and the whole rye thing does not fall into my taste.","Aarhus, DENMARK","djkatt"

167,"2015-07-11",5.0,"The foam is high, creamy and great nougat colored. The aroma offers luscious malt and clear signs of freshly baked rye bread. It is a very rich porter, where especially the sweet malt notes in the beginning has taken over. Later, the hint of dark bitter chocolate and a light, somewhat indefinable, spicy flavor. The sweetness is slightly sugary, but in a way that complements the taste really well. As a whole is as liquid bread, however, without being for peanuts like. In the end, the top of that one nicely marked hop bitterness. More proficient beer enthusiasts have taught me that it does not belong entirely at home in a real porter, and that it is slightly ""American"". The first time I encountered aggressive hops in a porter was with Gonzo Imperial Porter from Flying Dog - and here I was sold on the spot. Dark Pumpernickel Porter is certainly not an inferior one porter Gonzo, so I can probably not avoid giving it top points. The other beers I have tasted from Beer Here has moved too wild about my perception of beer. I shall certainly investigate a little more in Beer Here.","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"

The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of chocolate and roasted malt in it, as expected. The flavor is a bit different. There are still a lot of porter qualities such as the chocolate and roasted malt, but there is also a spiciness and a pumpernickel character which goes very well. The alcohol is definitely noticeable. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

The pour is vigorously effervescent and the head lasts in a thin ring. Very dark brown, virtually impenetrable. The flavor is moderately to highly sweet, moderately to highly bitter (acrid coffee aftertaste) and indeed has dark rye type feeling. Body is pretty hefty.

The taste has these components too, but the roastiness stands out even clearer, especially with the sour rye touch in the back of the mouth.

Appearance: On top of a very dark brown to black body sits a tall thick and very creamy head. The tan colored head hangs on forever and makes lots of thick sticky lacing that coast the glass.

Smell: The aroma is wonderful and inviting right from the poop of the cap. It is full of rich chocolately and dark bready maltiness with a hint of black licorice.

Taste/Palate: Not to be outdone by the aroma its medium to full body is packed with tasty chocolate like maltiness with dark roasted notes and dark bready rye malt flavors. I am also picking up some light hints of black licorice or star anise, as well as a very slight hint of caraway seed. All of this is wrapped up in pleasant mellow boozy warmth that blends right into the finish with some nice earthy hop flavor and moderate bitterness.

167,"2010-10-18",3.9,"bottle.  Pours black with nice big creamy frothy chocolate brown head.  Sweet malty aroma, butterscotch and toffee, and a bread like roastyness that must be why they call it pumpernickel, as well as a warm buttery aspect.  Rich, warm, silky mouth feel, highly drinkable, full bodied but soft.  Flavor is pretty complex, sweet yet sufficiently dark and roasty, and similar to aroma, featuring toffee, caramel, and butterscotch, with a roasted bread like backbone.

Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, rye, pumpernickel, toasted brown sugar, and earth.  The flavor reminded me of a lot of northern European dark beers Ive had before, with a lot of dark, roasty, chocolaty malts dominating.  Also some sugar, molasses, and earth.  I didnt get any pumpernickel in the flavor, just in the nose.  Medium-bodied, with average carbonation and a roasty, malty mouthfeel.  Solid beer, just not quite what I expected.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
167,"2010-09-23",3.3,"In short: A tasty dark ale of some kind.  Totally all over the place.  A bold mess.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh (probably) a few days after purchase
The look: Near black body topped by a medium beige head leaving lots of lacing
In long: Nose is burnt toasts, black cake, soft chewy cookies.  Taste has liquorice, rye bread, molasses, date cookies, bitter black chocolate, anise and peppery spiciness, milk chocolate, black coffee.  A lot of American style hopping with a resinous/citrusy character.  Very sweet.  Creamy mouthfeel.  This beer is all over the place and felt overall kind of weird.  This is one of those lets-throw-everything-in-the-tank type of beer.  I cant deny it is very tasty.  I could probably list another 20 flavor elements.  But it is messy and not highly drinkable.  Overall it is just a fun eccentricity.  I appreciate the effort brewers make to put out beer that are different.  But they should also look inside the box.  Theres some pretty neat ideas in there.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

167,"2010-09-11",4.1,"Bottle. Its a really dark beer, Id say black, but theres a brownish touch to the body. The head is two fingers thick, dense and tan, leaving lacings as the beer is enjoyed. Sweet on the nose, with salty licorice and roasted malts. Some coffee and a touch of alcohol too. Theres a little spiced note too, almost like fennel. Hops as well. Almost sticky on the palate, full-bodied and slightly warming, with coffee, roasted malts, licorice and a little alcohol. A fine bitterness chimes in, and the same spiced touch as in the aroma can be found. Sweet finish with licorice and roasted malts. And some bitterness to bring a little balance.

167,"2010-09-09",3.3,"A: The pour is nearly black with a sturdy tan head forming on top.

S: The nose is definitely reminiscent of a dark rye bread. Really hearty and slightly spiced along with a hint of sourness. Some slight caramel sweetness to go along with it.

T: A very surprising smokiness to the flavor. In fact, thats just about all you taste. Fairly bitter with not too much of the rye/pumpernickel actually coming through. Not much in the way of sweetness, either.

M: The body is medium with a fairly high carbonation.

Oh, plenty of resiny and herbal hops, some fig, starfruit and anise, with a touch of bubblegum weizen esters too. The taste is twangy and lactic with a brush of charred, coffee and chocolate covered hazelnut undertones. Remains with the rye snap, dark fruit, espresso and herbal hop bitterness to the ashy and earthy (a hint of peat bog too, yeah!) finish. The mouth feel is soft but not tepid, the right thickness for a porter, carbonated just enough to last towards the cracked rye dryness upon the finish.

On the trainer for the first period of this olympic GOLD game, stress carried on despite this, and in the second period when I opted for a bio-chemical approach to the intensity, since I ""needed a beer here,"" I suppose the label caught my attention. Been sitting on this for a while now. Bottle from SL. Freaking great pour, big huge head, slowly developing, but then it just kept on coming and coming. Choco colored on top of a great big dark brown-black body, intense looking. Aroma was strong full roast, chocolate, minty styrofoam hops. The flavor was big and bold, yet totally smooth, all the aroma elements mixed in, I guess pumpernickel was in there too, but heck, Id certainly not be able to place that if it didnt read that on the label. The mouthfeel may have been the best, dry finish to a smooth and silky body, just hearty, feeling almost like an oatmeal stout, rich, great, highly drinkable. Fantastic stuff!

It is like a naked woman standing in front of you, and yet, you cant do anything but watch the beauty i.e. I cant drink it with all that beautiful head sitting there. Big pumpernickel aroma. Smells like I am about to indulge in some good pretzels. Light spices are accompanying the pumpernickel. Slight sweet chocolate and rye-like aromas coming from this. A different twist on the porter I must say. Reminds me a little of the peat-like qualities of BrewDog beers, but I realize that this is the pumpernickel. Strong rye and pumpernickel at first. Nice bittering flavor then that is followed by a subtle roast. Sharp rye/pumpernickel flavor are just sitting on my taste buds, and dont seem to want to go anywhere. A smooth porter, but nothing spectacular. I appreciate the pumpernickel, but feel it is slightly overpowering.

Very thick full flavor, balanced between the roast and chocolate notes, on the sweeter side overall, though theres some bitterness on the finish.  While quite deep in its breadth of flavor, I cant say that it really recalls pumpernickel bread to me.  Reminds me more of something like a rich chocolate lava cake.  The mouthfeel is maybe my favorite aspect.  Its very full, soft, and wonderfully creamy.  Perfect light soft carbonation level suits the beer and body well.  I liked this one quite a bit.

The taste isnt complex, but it doesnt need to be, with predominant flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and smoke.  Everythings heavily roasted here, but it never passes over the threshold to astringency.  The mouthfeel is quite thick and smooth, and is coupled with a very enjoyable finish of baked bread.  This flavor is so strong it tastes as if Ive taken a bite of some fresh pumpernickel.  This finish lasts for some time.

167,"2009-12-01",4.0,"16.9 ounce bottle - $6.99 at Hop City in Atlanta, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours out an onyx black body with a thick, creamy-looking, tan-toned head. Smattering of tan lacing on the way down.

Smell: Dark, roasty with notes of dark bread and spice (which become more fragrant as it warms), with supporting, background hints of dark chocolate and dark fruits. Dark this, dark that.

Taste: Largely roasty beginning with sweet tastes of toasted bread, almond sugar, and melty bittersweet dark chocolate soon following down the line. The rye delivers a piquant spiciness, as does the, well, spices. Dark fruitiness tasting of prune juice lurking within. Most of the bitterness seems to have been gleaned from the roasted, burnt malts. After the bitterness passes, a sweet, rich taste of chocolate ganache settles on the tongue and lasts well beyond the supposed finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-low carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel all around.

Drinkability: Rich, roasty, and enjoyable without anymore alcohol than needed (or wanted, really). Given a couple minutes to warm, it does indeed settle into a fair taste of pumpernickel.

Pours completely black, opaque, with no light coming through anywhere.  Theres a small but thick tan head that shows very good retention and some delicate lacing.

The aroma has a healthy dose of roasted black malts and a noticeable licorice and molasses presence.  The spices are present but certainly not dominant.

The taste starts off much like the aroma with a thick, slightly charred black malt backbone supporting some molasses and dark fruit sweetness.  The spices are much more present in the taste, especially in the finish where there a tingly spice presence lingering after each sip.

The mouthfeel is full bodied and extremely viscous with soft carbonation and pretty thick on the palate overall.

I enjoyed this beer quite a bit as I think the pumpernickel really brings some complexity to the flavor and mixes well with the heavy roasted malts from the porter.  Very unique.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
167,"2009-11-21",3.8,"Bottle.  The body is an extremely dark mahogany color, almost black, with a thick and lasting head of smooth, brownish-mocha foam.  A dense wash goes over the glass with each sip, slowly breaking apart into fat spots that dribble their way back towards the surface.  The nose is complex and robust, striking an excellent balance between toasty dark bread, sweet dark fruit, dry cocoa roast, and bitter, earthen hops.  Hints of smoky molasses creep in, as do faint notes of licorice and coffee.  Its really quite a nice smelling beer.  Flavors are similarly balanced, though perhaps not quite as complex.  The rich cocoa, burnt caramel, and figgy fruit show ample sweetness to counter the roastiness of the dark bread and the earthy, peppery hops.  Its smokier than the nose would indicate, with the molasses coming through nicely, but theres a touch of saltiness that I dont really care for.  The coffee element intensifies on the finish.  Medium-plus in body and initially creamy, the palate shows a drying chalkiness on the back end.  Overall, this is a damn fine porter.  A few tweaks here and there would set this one near the top of the genre.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

167,"2009-11-21",4.5,"THOUGHTS: Brilliant. I was disappointed when I looked this beer up because the guy at the store told me it was a Nøgne Ø, but I tasted it as was very surprised and pleased. Reminded me or Tröegs Dead Reckoning Porter and was a little like Beer Geek Breakfast. Its crazy that not many others think this smells or tastes like pumpernickel bread, because it does. It was way better than I ever expected.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was an opaque black in the glass with a large, light brown head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy dark bread, pumpernickel, roasted and burnt malts and rye; a little less chocolate and coffee; and licorice and cola. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and bitter; while the finish was slightly sweet and rather bitter. There was roasted malt, dark bread, pumpernickel, rye, dark fruit, licorice, coffee, and a little bitter chocolate. The medium to full body that leaned more toward full was a bit oily, but somewhat creamy had fizzy carbonation and a slightly metallic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

167,"2009-11-07",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2009 Bottle.

The pour is basically black with a beige creamy head that leaves nice lacings.

The smell is spicy with distinct notes of anise and fennels. Dense roasted malts. Hints of licorice, smoke, coffee, chocolate. Unfortunately, I also pick up aromas reminiscent of watercolor. 

The taste is better than the smell, not as  spicy but not with the notes of watercolor either. Its rather sweet with notes of mild roasted malts, fennels, anise, coffee and powdered chocolate. The finish is mildly bitter with some juicy malts, hints of hops and rustic bready spices. It also develops nicely in the glass as it seems to come together better after a while. 

Its full bodied and has a smooth creamy texture.

All in all, an interesting stout with lots of character. However, slightly too spicy to be really good.","Malme, SWEDEN","ricke"

The flavor was soy, chocolate, rye pumpernickel bread, grassy hops on the aftertaste.

Nose is very pleasant with some dark chocolates German chocolate cake, restrained Columbian coffee, toasted almonds, hints of charred wood, and buttery dark breads.

Palate is creamy, medium, and soft to lively.  Finishes with chocolate cake, buttery dark breads, and some moderately low bitterness and spice from the hops.  The beer has so many pleasant things going on but the buttermilk note in the flavor is a bit offputting.  It is hard for me to say the buttermilk notes were insignificant, but everything else was so wonderful that the beer still leaves me liking it.

Theres a thick mocha-colored head that laces the sides of the glass with a mass of bubbles as I drink it.  The aroma is sweet, roasted malt but noticeably simpler than the flavor.  The flavor is round and full.  There are notes of black coffee, dark chocolate, hot cocoa and burnt caramel in the malt.  The hops add a hint of earth and minerals.  The beers thick, creamy mouthfeel accentuates the flavor very well.  It reminds me quite a bit of a bitter, complex (and cold) cup of hot cocoa.  I dont know how it was brewed, how pumpernickel was utilized, but it works exceptionally well.  Without knowing the name of the beer, Im not sure that Id really pick up on it, but there do seem to be some rich toasted bread flavors in the beer.

Black, huge tan head. Rich spicy aroma - a dark roast, but the spice lightens it magically. Roast palate, with excellent well-balanced hops. Finish has all the deeply roasted, or should I say burnt, malts, and the lovely fresh hops too. An excellent hoppy stout.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
167,"2009-08-08",4.2,"(Bottled) Very dark brown with a large and lasting (depending on pouring style), lacy and beige head. Incredibly strong, salty aroma of licorice root, peat, and seaweed. Flavor is also strongly salty-licoricey, although not quite as intense as the aroma, with slightly sweet maltiness, and without the peat. Medium body with soft carbonation. A very intense and delicious brew! Reminds me of Djævlebryg Pride of Nekron, only with tar replaced with peat, and saltiness (luckily) tuned down an inch.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
167,"2009-08-07",4.0,"Bottle. Black with brownish, caramel fudge head. Aroma of cocoa, coffee, licorice, roasted malts and brown sugar. Also an unusual spiciness. Bready flavour with notes of rye and spices along with the same notes found in the aroma. It has a long, lingering bitterness in the end which still leaves room for the malty dominated flavour in the beer. Unfortunately some of the sweetness in the beer disappears, but that makes the next sip so much more surprising and complex, which makes for a more interesting and outstanding beer beer in the long run. It definately is a beer, Ill remember for its own imprint on this beer style. Represents Christians playfullness well.","Amager (form. Nørrebro&Aalborg), DENMARK","MPA"
