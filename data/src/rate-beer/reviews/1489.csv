Soft spicy coffee as well. Quite sweet milk chocolate in taste, slight spicy coffee and roast. Delicious, although the milk chocolate might become a bit too dominant if you had to drink the whole bottle by yourself.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"

1489,"2017-02-04",4.1,"Thanks Ryan for sharing the bottle! Poured into a wineglass showing pitch black with half a finger of latte colored foam. 

The nose shows a noticeable cinnamon and chili heat framed around a lot of intense bakers chocolate and dark chocolate. Upon warming up, a slight coconut character becomes apparent. Very rich nose.

The palate is light bodied and lightly carbonated. Light sweetness runs throughout with a lot of dark chocolate character. Chili and spiciness appears on the mid-palate. Finish shows an equally intense dark chocolate bitterness. Very good, but I personally prefer Abraxas.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

1489,"2016-12-25",4.1,"Bottle. Pours out pretty much black with a small tan head. Aroma is of chocolate, earthy pepper, coffee, cinnamon, sweet creamy notes and maybe vanilla. Taste is complex, chocolate, medium roast coffee, some syrup, cinnamon, earthy pepper with only a very slight touch of spice. Balance and complexity are the name of the game here.

1489,"2016-11-08",3.9,"Old note, from Hunahpu Day 16: black pour. aroma of chocolate, coffee, cinnamon. tastes of cinnamon, light pepper heat, burnt, dark chocolate. thinnish oily palate. very nice.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DialSquare"
1489,"2016-03-22",4.3,"From notes. On draft at Hunahpus Day 2016 in Tampa on March 12. The pour on this one is excellent. Hard to believe its just a porter. Its a thick and heavy black with a dark mocha colored small head that slowly fades down to a film, leaving no lace. The aroma is pretty good. Lots of cinnamon and cocoa powder. There is a little syrup, definitely not as much as Id like, and a touch of coffee. The chilies really dont add anything to the nose, and thats a little disappointing. The flavor is excellent. There is a little more cocoa powder to fight the cinnamon. The maple comes through a lot more. There is a milky sweetness that I do like, and there is a slight heat from the chilies. The balance is amazing. The mouth feel is a bit thin. Its got a slightly watery finish with it. The aftertaste is fantastic. Lots of maple and chocolate to go along with just the slightest peppery-cinnamon finish. This is an excellent offering.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1489,"2016-02-13",4.3,"On tap at extreme beerfest 2016. Black ith mocha color head. Aroma is cinnamon, maple, coffee, and toffee. Taste is where i get a bit of pepper and the rich lactose character comes out. Great beer.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

1489,"2015-07-18",4.2,"Pours dark cola brown with a one finger tan head with decent lacing. Aroma is of cinnamon, bakers coco, hedbs, toasted malts, maple syrup, and some coffee. Taste is about the same as the aroma. Has a medium body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a mostly sweet, long, slightly warming finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
1489,"2015-06-16",4.8,"this tastes sorta exactly like Sunday Brunch to me - Im not picking up much spiciness or smokiness - but no matter, Sunday Brunch is a 5/5 world class beer and this is very much the same. luscious cinnamon, maple syrup, and chocolate collide for arguably the most delicious stout/porter Ive ever had. wonderful work, Kane.","","Mineo"
1489,"2015-05-30",4.0,"Pours a medium density pitch black with a smaller foamy mocha head. Aroma is coffee, cinnamon, burnt toast, maple syrup and a hint of black pepper. Flavor is way better, initial burst of maple syrup followed by coffee and cream, burnt toast, dark chocolate, vanilla extract, tiny bit of pepper on the back end. Medium to fuller body with softer carbonation and an almost creamy mouthfeel overall.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
1489,"2015-05-26",3.9,"32oz growler from the brewery. Pours black with a finger of creamy tan head. Aroma is full of coffee and cinnamon up front, followed by dark chocolate, and just a hint of chili pepper. Taste of black coffee, cinnamon, chills (but no heat), dark chocolate, burnt toast, and hints of maple sweetness. Thinner then I was expecting. Sunday brunch is still the winner for me!","Forked River, New Jersey, USA","Ed5388"
1489,"2015-05-25",4.1,"Draft. Pours oily black with a 1 finger tan head. Huge coffee aroma up front. After the coffee you get dark chocolate, cinnamon and maple syrup. The peppers make a very brief appearance. No real heat from them. Rich and sticky mouthfeel but not overly viscous. Pretty great. This is what I wanted Sunday Brunch to be.","","conway"
1489,"2015-05-24",4.0,"Growler from Kane. Dark cola with a mocha ring head. Maple syrup and cinnamon aroma. The taste coffee, chocolate, a lot of cinnamon, and just enough chili spice on the finish. Rich mouthfeel with balanced flavors. Excellent all around.
