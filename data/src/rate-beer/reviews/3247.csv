3247,"2017-06-18",3.2,"330 mL bottle shared by ebone1988 for this fucking book. The pour is a hazy golden yellow color. This is a lot foggier than I would ever expect a tripel to be. There is an off white head and a pretty good amount of lace as it falls. The aroma is full of banana and clove. There is a strong yeastiness and a light funk with a touch of tartness on the nose. Its got a very tripel thing happening. The flavor is a little better and more balanced. The banana and clove are pretty hard to get past, especially when backed up by the yeast. The subtleties slowly come in with a light fruitiness, a hint of dustiness and a good balance. The mouth feel is light and clean with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly clove and fruit on the finish. This is further proof that tripels arent my jam, at all. 6 3 6 4 13","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3247,"2017-05-28",4.0,"330ml bottle bought at ICBeer in Kwun Tong.
Looks: Translucent light golden colour with a ring of dirt-like yeast sediments; Three finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet Pils malt, with strong orange, pineapples, bananas, vanilla, strong bubblegum, waffles, floral, sugar, cloves, spices, herbs, strong Bel yeast, lemon and strong grass. Very nice!

Taste: Medium sweet Pils malt, with strong metallic, tartness, orange, floral, sugar, light spices, light herbs, Bel yeast, biscuits, lemon, mid to strong bitter hops and sharp grass.

Body: Mid to full body. Slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Solid Pils maltyness in a slightly thinned background. Still slick and smooth. Strong Bel yeast imprints with nice orange ester, flowery with nice strong sweetness with is balanced by subtle tartness. 8% booze is very well hidden. Notable hops presence with fair herbs and light spices. Biscuity with quite strong lemon to round. Very nice!

Hoppiness: Floral, spices, herbs, lemon and strong grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, close to high astringent sweet-bitter orangey malty finish. 

After Taste: Fairly dry. Herbal hoppy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one has good looks and head, wonderfully fruity Bel yeasty aroma, a pretty well attenuated body with good sweetness and nice yeasty spicyness rounded with sublime herbal hops. Impressively tasted with an refreshing edge like a Saison, I cant help to think St. Bernardus can wave its magic wand to impress with any style at any level. A real joy!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

3247,"2017-05-19",2.6,"For some bizarre reason I seem to be drawn to Belgian beers like a moth to a flame and each time, like a moth, I end up getting burnt. The top was a bit dodgy which makes me suspicious about the taste There was a nice flavour of hops and that typical Belgian yeast, but there was also, to me anyway, an overpowering sourness to the beer. I am no fan of sour beers, but I persevered. It was better with food (finished while eating grilled pork chops) than on its own. Overall nice colour, good head, nice low carbonation and definite malt hops and yeast, but too sour for me.","Hertford, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","Davros IX"

A la versée, blonde troublée avec une mousse à bulles multiples stabilisée sur 3 millimètres. 5/5, lapparence mimporte peu de toute façon, donc cest le même tarif pour tout le monde. Nez sur les agrumes, citron vert et pamplemousse en tête, du caramel bien net, de la prune, de la mirabelle, des fruits jaunes (ananas notamment), du malt chocolat à petite dose, des arômes de cuir et de bois résineux assez perceptibles. Bon nez, pas très complexe, pas non plus quelconque mais un peu trop banal à mon goût. En bouche, texture souple, amertume sur la fin uniquement, la carbonatation est moyenne, lalcool reste sobre. Les saveurs sont vraiment sur les céréales et le caramel, un peu trop dailleurs. Malheureusement, cette Tripel est en cela très limité au niveau gustatif, le final est plat, sans relief.

3247,"2016-11-03",3.7,"If I had to describe this is one word it would be smooth, on every level. It pours a hazy gold, with a big fluffy head. The nose is floral and musty, something in the vein of yeast, or dough. The mouthfeel is quite full but the high carbonation cuts that down a bit. The taste is lightly floral, lightly spicy, modestly malty, and mildly sweet with no hop bitterness, a bit of that yeasty nose carrying through, and just a hint of alcohol. There are no bold flavours in this beer but since every element is so subtle it allows a lot of flavours to come through without overloading the palate. A classic tripel!","Ontario, CANADA","BrewWhatIWant"

3247,"2016-10-20",4.0,"8%ABV. Tripel.

Poured out gold. 6ºSRM.

Nose is sour and wit-like. Can I say witty? There are aromas of raw wheat flour and proofing bread dough. A bit of nice stone dust or cement dust in the nose. Other aromas that could approximate what Im describing might be clay and plaster of paris and soft chalk.

Mouthfeel is light and beery. There is pronounced carbonation. Palate has some nice white bread, white bread toast, sweet dough and wheat flour flavors. Nice noble hop balance. Nice little hit of alcohol right at the end before the hops set in. The hops are noble and taste of old oak or aged hardwood.

Finish is clean and very ethereally sweet and light.

Very good and very close to my favorite abbey tripel of all time, Karmeliet Tripel.

Brasserie dont les recettes sont issues des moines trappistes de Westleveren qui, après la seconde guerre mondiale avaient, pour un temps, décidé de céder la commercialisation de leurs bières. Se présente donc devant moi, religieusement, la St Bernardus Triple (8 % Abv). 
De couleur blonde aux reflets dorés, opaque, celle-ci présente un effervescence importante. La mousse dun cm dépaisseur environ lui confère une véritable noblesse. 
Le nez se porte sur les arômes de citrons, de levure et de blé. Demblée, sont présentes, toutes les caractéristiques permettant de faire de cette bière une triple belge de référence.
La dégustation ne fait pas mentir cette impression. Lattaque, délicate, se présente sur des arômes de malt avec des nuances épicées. Vous arrive ensuite en bouche une amertume, fine, sur des notes de citron et coriandre. Lensemble est très soyeux, une subtile harmonie envahissant votre palais. Le final, dune longueur appréciable est très rond. Les arômes de miel et décorce dorange sont alors présents, mais sans lourdeur grâce à lamertume toujours bien présente.
En conclusion, la St Bernardus Tripel est une bière que tout amateur de bière belge devrait avoir dégusté, tout le savoir faire brassicole de ce splendide pays sy retrouvant.","FRANCE","jybi"

3247,"2015-12-03",4.0,"This was poured into a chalice. 
The appearance was a hazy to cloudy burnt pale orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a half a minute. Lacing is messy with light foamy strings.
The smell had a sweet pear with the ""iced aples"" I normally get with most tripels. Light ""cake-like"" quality runs nicely. Light Belgian spices end up coming out slightly as it warms. 
The taste was mainly sweet through the malts and then slides into a sweet tropical fruity flavor. Dry sweet fruity aftertaste leads into the finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to be good and low. Dryness hits my tongue decently. 
Overall, I wonder if Ive had too many Americanized versions of tripels that now when I go to have a real Belgian one that I get thrown off a bit.

3247,"2015-09-29",4.0,"La brasserie Saint Bernardus nous propose avec cette bière une référence parmi les fameuses triples belges. Dans le cas de ces bières, le terme triple est utilisé pour décrire une méthode de brassage ou l’on utilise trois fois plus de malt qu’à l’accoutumé pour obtenir le même volume final. Sur le plan gustatif, le résultat peut être exceptionnel. La couleur, blonde dorée, est relativement classique pour ce type de bière. Toutefois, le nez révèle une certaine finesse. Épices et très légères touches de fruits se mêlent avec l’alcool, lui aussi légèrement perceptible. La bouche présente une attaque malté, mais très vite équilibrée par l’impression d’ester fruité. La finesse des bulles, l’équilibre parfait rendent cette bière facile à boire et à la portée de tout le monde.

Floral hops at the beginning, together with clove, pear and a biscuity maltiness, spiced with nutmeg. The most outstanding thing to the nose is the intense, floral, illustrating hop note among slightly funky Belgian yeast. 

The same thing applies to the taste, floral, grassy notes define the first impression. The processed hops arent particularly bitter, but they do confirm the spices of the brew outstandingly well, adding a lot more character to the beer, than the usual Tripel would allow. Spiciness has a semi-dry note to it, while peppers, cinnamon, ripe banana, pear and apple, as well as burned caramel shine through. Includes also an earthy, herbal coordinate, close to a Saison, which gets detectable during the slightly bitter finish, accompanied by soft, slightly slick yeast.","GERMANY","aleigator"

How fun! The spicy notes of the strong flavour are more coriander-like, I get lots of Belgian yeast, banana, alcohol and pale malts. The long-lasting finish has notes of honey and flowers.

3247,"2014-10-17",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2014 The tripel in this series, if I am not mistaken this was the first beer with which they deviated from the Westvleteren staple, which they are historically allied with, as we all know. Medium thick, off-white, irregular head, opening after a while; colour a deep ochre blonde, slightly hazy at first, cloudy with deposit. Estery and malty aroma with hints of icing sugar, mango, brown bread, pepper, apricot jelly, cloves, bananas, apple sauce, calvados, raw potatoes, cinnamon, coriander, marzipan, freshly grated ginger, sweet white grapes, butterscotch, earth, dough. Taste begins with a pleasant fruitiness, citrus freshness but in a subtle way, quite strong and minerally carbonation, smooth but full, mellow mouthfeel, sweetish bready malts, yeasty, a bit starch-like with a dry, medium long finish bearing herbal and somewhat peppery hop bitterness along with the lasting yeastiness and booze, in the form of warming, agreeable, gin-like alcohol. Now heres a good tripel: sweeter, more gentle and more bready than mother Westmalle, but on a par with this great archetype of the style, with a very good balance between sweet and dry.

3247,"2014-08-20",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 12-25-12-

 Poured from bottle into wine glass

 Appearance  The beer poured a hazy orange amber color with a one finger, rather fizzy white head. The head fades relatively fast giving a decent level of lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma was lighter then I would have expected with it being mainly of a candied sugar and light fruit aroma of peach and apple. Mixed with these sweeter smells were some notes of a bready and wheaty nature as well, giving it a rather traditional triple, but light traditional, triple aroma.

 Taste  The taste starts out with a lighter fruit and bready flavor. Flavors of pear and peach mixed with a lighter orange flavor, create the fruit flavor base, while the bready flavor has some light notes of a wheat bread nature. As the flavor advances, the yeast starts to make its presence known. This mixed with a light candied flavor as well as a newly arriving clove spice and boozy flavor. The boozy flavor gets stronger as the taste advances further, and at the end the mix of sweet, boozy and bready flavors leaves a satisfying and warming flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  For an 8% abv. triple the body of the beer is just above average in its creaminess and chewiness with a carbonation level that is very appropriate for the style at a medium to slightly above medium level, Both are nice for accentuating the fruity, sweet and boozy flavors of the brew.

 Overall  A rather delicious triple. It had a little more boozy flavors then would have been expected for its 8% abv. strength, and its nose was a little weak, but overall it had great flavors, a nice look and a wonderful feel.","","Darkmagus82"

Lively & fruity as well with some orange and citrus notes on top of an apple and grape base. Naturally the beer is quite sweet as a result of the fruits and comes with some sugar and some peppery spice too with alcohol well hidden.

Orange/amber with 0.5cm of tiny white bubbles and plenty of visible carbonation. Head retention is good considering the strength & it holds for a few minutes.

Sweet with orange & citrus plus some grapes and a little Belgian yeast on top of some banana too although this is quite light and barely detectable at first. There is a floral, almost perfume like taste that starts to come through alongside some tropical fruits and some peppery spice.

Crisp and lively with plenty of carbonation and a medium body that is quite sweet and dry, particularly towards the end of the beer. The beer had a great balance to it with the fruits all coming together well to completely hide the alcohol in the beer.

One that I quite enjoyed and one that despite the strength went down quite easily thanks to the good balance between fruits and the lively carbonation. I was expecting the beer to be a good one and it didnt disappoint and despite the fact the finish was a dry one.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Aroma is full of traditional triple notes including big yeast and bready tones.  Additional complexities include orange peel, light spice, and mild malts  Upon a second attempt at the aroma is a sweat malty characteristic and a light alcohol barrel character reminiscent of a dubbel or even a quad.  Excellent mouth feel on the palate with a slight creaminess on the finish.  Immediately, you know that this is going to be a good beer.  Finishes with a low alcohol warmness with a light malt flavor that lingers very nicely.

3247,"2013-03-17",3.7,"330 ml bottle, poured into a tulip glass at home. ABV 8%.
Despite my careful pour, I got some little yeast chunks in my glass, but that doesnt matter that much. Light orange copper in colour, with two fingers of white, soapy head. Very good retention on the foam and a slight lacing on the the glass.
Aroma is fruity, with very obvious yeast and sugar notes.
Quite sweet on the taste. Again, yeast, sugars, some light banana on the aftertaste, along with a very faint alcohol trace, more notable by the warmth it gives rather than the taste to be honest. Nice and complex.
Medium on the body, good carbonation and a tart feeling on the palate.

In general Im not huge fan of these ""St. Bernardus""(like only 12th and 8th ones), even I really like Belgian style beer. But his one was a really great surprise.

Appearance: very thick with massive ""beer precipitate"" in glass, thats not allowing any light beam to get through the glass. But looks outstanding.

Aroma: casual Belgian style aroma, with some sour yeast, but Ive always like it so, yeah, this rules.

3247,"2012-10-31",3.7,"alla spina. non sono mai rimasto deluso dalla produzione del birrificio st. bernardus, e nemmeno bevendo questa tripel lo sono, effettivamente :)
la schiuma derivata dalla spina sembra una crema e si sente un delicato aroma floreale e di lievito, ma sparisce immediatamente (probabilmente a causa della temperatura di servizio un po bassa). in bocca emerge un mielato eccellente e ben bilanciato da un leggero tono di acidità. sul finale emergono note amare di luppolo dai sentori erbacei. mi stupisce la grande scorrevolezza di questa birra, che, nonostante la gradazione non certo soft, invita a prenderne subito un altro calice. certamente non è una birra miracolosa, ma è di fattura indubbiamente elevata, e comunque è difficile aspettarsi dei prodigi da birre come le tripel che, a mio parere e non solo mio, sono generalmente birre di facile approccio, e non avranno mai (o quasi) una profondità rilevante.","santa marinella, ITALY","jorrvaskr77"

3247,"2012-04-27",4.3,"28 Oct 2009: I wrote this. 33cl bottle, best before 08 Mar 10. Had this bottle for some time, my wife and I are staying at the brewery in two weeks time, so Ive decided to open the one remaining St Bernardus I own before we travel. Very suprised to see Ive never reviewed the tripel before.

Poured carefully into a Westmalle Chaice; no sediment in the pour, so a clear old gold body sits in my glass, on top a solid foam blanket of bubbles. Bubbles rise through the beer, it looks inviting. The head has the power, strenght and condition to stay complete throughout the tasting, very rare, even on the best tripels. The sediment was poured into a small wine tasting glass, it was taken after the review.

Dough aromas, with yeast, but this isnt any sort of bread in my hand. The sediment had a more vinegarous and potent smell.

A deep warm glow desends down your body as you sip the beer, this is good stuff. It feels a lot heavier than the 8%ABV it admits too, some real body in this master of tripels.

I am very lucky (various reasons) and have had many Belgian tripels, both on tap and bottled, this is without doubt one of the best.

I mentioned in the review I would be staying at the brewery, well the first beer I had from the fridge in the Brouwershuys was a Triple and it was poured for me by no less than Hans Depypere, the owner of the brewery.

La brasserie St Bernard fait partie des ""Belgian Family Brewers"", même
si effectivement à un moment donné, elle a obtenu le droit de brasser 
selon la recette des pères Trappistes. Ceci est une exception assez rare
pour bien entendu être mentionné, et puis attirer lattention sur cette bière précieuse....
Cette triple titre à 8 % abv et mon exemplaire était à date au 11/5/2012.
Au versage, elle est extraordinairement vivante avec des milliers de bulles très fines partout, et une belle mousse blanche encore assez stable... Sa couleur de ""blé dor"", doré clair, est splendide.
Les arômes sont sur lamertume du houblon, le blé sec, et une pointe de
gingembre.
La texture de la première gorgée est soyeuse à épaisse.
La première bouche est superbe de fraîcheur, avec lorge mûr et une 
pointe dabricot et de fruits confits. On sent que la complexité va être au
rendez-vous...
Deuxième nez toujours aussi frais.
Deuxième bouche où lamertume du houblon souligne un caractère et 
une très belle complexité.
Le troisième nez trouve un petit zeste dorange très fine.
La 3ème bouche ne faiblit pas et transmet un maximun dimpressions...
avec une petite touche de citron pressé et dagrumes.
La levure est dense, vineuse et digne dune spéciale.
La longueur est très belle, et les impressions en progression.
Lalcool est bien dosé, et prouve encore une fois que 8 est la bonne mesure pour une triple.
La finaleest équilibrée et fait encore découvrir dautres éléments qui viennent sajouter à une palette déjà bien riche...
Nous découvrons ici le grand peintre flamand qui fait sortir de son pinceau et de ses couleurs une harmonie qui ne faiblit jamais, et nous
montre la voie du paradis.
Le savoir-faire de St Bernard est ici dans toute sa majesté.

St. Bernardus Tripel pours a hazy dark orange copper color with a thick creamy white head. A good level of retention, and each sip leaves generous lace clinging to the glass. A bit darker than I would expect out of the style.

Tons of fruity and spice notes in the nose. I expected the spicy yeast aroma, but the pineapple, apricot, and other tropical fruit really surprised me. Also seems to be some apple and cherry in there. 

This is about as perfect of a flavor in a tripel as I can remember having. It starts out well, with a combination of toffee and honey providing most of the sweetness. Juicy apricot and pineapple come in before the spicy yeast takes over. Wow - allspice, cloves, maybe some cinnamon and pepper as well. A light herbal and citrus hop presence perfectly match the original flavors on the tongue. There is a touch of alcohol in the flavor that is tolerable.

Both crisp and creamy, it has carbonation to lift any residue off the tongue and keep each sip feeling fresh, but it has a soft creaminess that is quite pleasant. It starts juicy, but it starts moving toward dry by the end. A touch grainy from the unfiltered nature of the beer.

One of, if not my absolute, favorite tripels. This will frequently be found in my fridge.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3247,"2011-02-13",3.5,"330 ml bottle, BB date reads 09-25-2012, into tulip. Clear, effervescent golden body is overlain by airy white head that doesnt last and completely dissipates. Id expect the head to be firmer and creating more lace as subsides. Aroma exhibits light, somewhat bready, toasty malt character with a nice interplay of fruity esters, phenols, sweetness and alcohol. The significant fruity esters are represented by orange, pineapple, mango and peach, followed by moderate spicy and clove-like phenols, evident candy sugar sweetness and restrained soft spicy alcohol. As far as the aroma section is considered, the balance between esters and phenols is leaned towards the former while in the flavor dept the later prevail. Soft malty body embraces dominant peppery phenols and spicy alcohol flavor, subdued citrusy esters of orange, and moderately high bitterness that seems to result especially from the yeast-derived phenols as well as from hoppy bitterness. The relatively high bitterness combines with moderate carbonation to lend a dry finish with spicy aftertaste.

Taste is malty sweet, with more of the anise coming through, and a little bit of fresh baked biscuit. Just enough bitterness on the finish to carry the alcohol. Very complex, a super brew.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","scarletfire65"
3247,"2010-12-26",4.7,"Poured into a St. Bernardus trappist glass. Appearance: Pours a deep golden to light amber with a one finger creamy white head that settles into a thin film and leaves some lacing. Aroma: tropical fruits fill the nose, unfamiliar to me in a beer until now. Some light malts, bready yeast, and flowery hops accompany the fruits in the background. Taste: the tropical fruits burst in the taste. The sweet and sour reminiscent of pineapples, mangoes, and coconuts combined hits at first followed by some cereal and yeast notes and finishing pleasantly dry. The abv is basically undetectable. Overall: this is a fantastic tripel. Different than others ive had in the best way. Not cloyingly sweet like many are. Perfectly balanced between sweet, sour, and dry. Delicious.","Pennsylvania, USA","Breinstein"

A drab, swampy-colored pour, but with a surprisingly big, foamy head.  Aroma is mostly yeast (unfortunately).  The flavor too is pretty yeasty for the style, but it is still a tasty brew.  There is some wheat, some biscuit-like sweetness, and sprightly hops in the finish.  It gets sweeter and maltier as it warms in the glass.

3247,"2010-12-10",3.6,"Pours very cloudy, light orange colour with a huge white frothy head. Aroma is multy-dimensional with plenty of yeast: earthy and soft flowery notes come first as obvious associations. Fruity hints and a little of a grainy backbone but not in a sweet lager way. It might be just me but I found a trace of lemon which might show a tiny bit of hops. 
Flavor is much softer than expected... unfortunately. It is pretty much sweet with an lightly alcoholic vibe and some lemony touches. Nothing to die for. It is a lot more restrained than other tripels like, say, Westmalle, Chimay or La Trappe with which are compared often.
 Medium body with a sticky texture showing a little heaviness in the mouth but also a reasonable complexity. Low carbonation and long finish with a good concealing of alcohol.

It looks like a nasty fishtank that hasnt been cleaned in months! Actually, the color is really cool and the head is big and frothy, but those yeast particles are a turn-off (and they were from the top of the bottle).Aroma: Smells pretty much the same as the other St. Bernies beers. Some light fruit, noticeable alcohol presence. Fairly mild overall.Taste: Much more robust than the Watou Tripel, but still weaker than some of the Trappist tripels. A melange of light fruit like apricot, peach, maybe even honeydew. Theres a fairly rich caramel and butterscotch sweetness too. Little bitterness. Flavor doesnt peter out at the end like the other beers from this brouwerij.Mouthfeel: Noticeably thick, but soft and gentle. Doesnt tear up my palate. A slightly creamy texture from the head tingles the tongue.Drinkability: Mild taste and soft mouthfeel make for a very smooth beer. I did find myself burping every once in a while, but the least of all the St. Bernardus beers.Overall: St. Bernarduss second-best beer, but definitely not the best Tripel in Belgium.

On the palate, light-medium in body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. This is a nice tripel, but lacks somewhat in complexity: I would expect a bit more at 8% ABV.

3247,"2010-04-22",4.3,"Bottle.

A - Hazy copper orange with a large creamy white head. Ok retention (a bit below average) with a nice layer of lacing left.

S - Good base of malt along with some along with some golden fruit and citrus. Lemon and orange along with some peach, apricot, and apple to name some of the fruity aromas. Good amount of yeast and spices as well. Hints of some banana and bubblegum Hefe aromas as well.

T - Similar to the nose. Malt base provides a nice sweetness with some Hefe flavors and a slight hint of breadiness. Good amount of Belgian spices and yeast and a pretty strong fruity taste (similar to the nose). A little bit of citrus tart and very little bitterness comes out as well. Well balanced with sweetness coming out slightly ahead.

M - Medium body with average carbonation. Smooth and slightly creamy. 

D - Very drinkable beer. A lot of fruit and overall sweet but not even close to cloying. Well balanced with some spiced, warming, tart, and bitter flavors present in the background at varying levels. Warming beer but the alcohol is well hidden. Enjoyable to drink.

Notes: Nice Tripel that is big and fruity but also well balanced. A very solid offering from a very good brewery. Definitely worth trying.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"
3247,"2010-04-22",4.2,"12 oz. bottle poured into my Chimay chalice

A- Body is a light golden hue. Pours with a beautiful creamy 1 finger eggshell head which has perfect retention. Lots of lacing is left behind in the glass. Body is slightly translucent and yeast can be seen floating throughout as bubbles steadily rise to the top.

S- Mild fruit such as apples and pears upfront with a subtle presence of alcohol. Spicy Belgian yeast buried deep in the background.

T- Taste is soft and subtle the whole way around. A soft fruitiness upfront with a slight yeasty background. Spicy yeast comes through for the finish. All that lingers is a touch of alcohol warmth.

P-Low carbonation and body that is very smooth and creamy. well done.

O- This is a nice, light, refreshing tripel. There are others that I enjoy a lot more but this is still a good one. It was great to get to try such a well-hyped example of this style. I will probably have it again-but not too soon because it is so expensive.

Im drinking out of a St. Bernardus Goblet and that just makes it all the prettier (the glass is great, by the way, almost an over-sized wine glass). The head is wonderfully Belgian. This beer has its share of delicate funky yeast. The flavor is a careful balance of bitterness and earthiness. There are some good sweet malt notes lurking in the background, and I wish that they were a touch stronger or richer or something, but I guess thats not the way of most Belgians.

The aroma is unmistakably St. Bernardus with the signature fruity esters - bubble gum and banana - from the yeast.  There is a light spiciness to the nose and some sugary apples and pears.

The taste is much the same but seems even sweeter and much fruiter with the pears and apples really coming to the front.  The yeast backbone is hefty and imparts the banana sweetness that I got in the aroma.  The finish has some peppery spices but less than some tripels Ive had.

The mouthfeel is extremely creamy and close to full-bodied for the style.  Lots of carbonation as well.

3247,"2010-01-03",3.9,"Hazy oranges and golds hang heavy in my chalice under a thick orange creamsicle head which fades in rocky patches. Clumps of lace cling to the sides of my glass even as I tilt her orange-gold depths towards my nose to breath deep of her promise. Did someone open a jar of orange marmalade and apricot jam? I could swear someone did because my St. Bernardus Tripel could certainly pass as one. Rich, sweet, and a bit heavy, her nose grabs the orange marmalade and apricot jelly and leads me right into a heavy cloud of Belgian yeast, spice, dough, and sweet alcohol warmth. A bit of pineapple joins the mix which rests comfortably atop a solid foundation of graham crackers and sourdough. At the back of each whiff is a funky hit of sour lemons even as nutmeg, cinnamon sticks, and spiced apples tickle and tease. Mm tasty, and I havent even tasted her yet, a travesty of epic proportions I must correct immediately. Eyes closed in reverence, I part my lips and invite her rich golden-orange depths into my being. Bright and dry, my first generous quaff is much drier than I was expecting, especially considering how wet her nose was. A bit of an adjustment, but one I am enjoying. Belgian yeast, spice, and warmth are immediate even as my mouth starts to dry. As my body picks up soothing warmth, dry brown spices mingle and meddle atop my tongue: nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and for added measure, dry wood. Spiced apples, apricot jam, and orange marmalade fill the middle of her body with a faint hint of brandy warmth and spice. Fresh whole pineapples along with red apples, pears, and kiwi join the growing tropical mix even as she continues to dry my senses. A hit of sweet alcohol warmth in the back of my throat lingers for a long dry spiced finish. Her nose could not have been more different than her body, but as I near the end of my bottle and my glass, I find that they are actually more similar than different.


Different in all the best ways possible. Once more St. Bernardus proves their brewing mettle. Its easy to understand why, at one point, the discerning Trappist monks at Westvleteran chose them to brew their sacred beers. Westvleteran is nigh impossible to get here in the states, but I can get St. Bernardus any and every day of the week. Speaking of which, I think I shall have to bring some more St. Bernardus home with me for future heavenly sessions.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Pours a sunny hazy blonde color with a thick luxurious head that doesnt look like its going away any time soon. As I drink the beer a very thick lace is left on the glass. Aromas of fresh baked baguette, good yeasty spiciness, some hay, and some lemon rind. The flavor reminds me at first of a very good pilsner with the nice mildly spicy hoppiness and the bready bright lightly salty malt character. The flavor turns more complex in a hurry though with some light banana notes some mild sweetness, some spiciness, with some minerally character (the good kind) . There are some citrusy lemony flavors both in a raw lemon and lemon candy kind of way that is not to say that the beer is particularly sour, far from it.

It is bright gold, very clear before the sediment makes it hazy.  A huge white head  shrinks steadily but quickly  to a lasting, thin wispy top.  It produces a little uneven, foamy lace. 

The aroma is a lot of grain with light raisin, mineral, bread crust, mineral, a hint of pear and hay, somewhat resembling a pale bock.

The taste is up front pear and hay with mineral, slightly raisiny but mostly dry.  It soon becomes drier in alcohol with a hint of lemon pulp, but all thin and dry.

3247,"2009-10-23",3.6,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle into a goblet. There is a best before date of 19-07-10 on the back label and it was sampled on 7-1-09.

Appearance: Its head is bright white in color and about one finger in thickness. The light foamy head fades quickly down to just a small ring of foam that makes slick lacing on the glass as I swirl and sip. Under this head is an orangey tan colored liquid which is cloudy and full of tan yeast floaters.

Smell: The aroma has notes of fresh peeled apple skins, funky yeast and a touch of apple cider vinegar. 

Taste/Mouth: There is a slightly astringent, citrus and hard apple cider flavor with some spicy phenolic character as well. The finish becomes bone dry with flavor notes of dry powdery yeast and some mild leafy hops that add just a touch of bitterness. The carbonation is light and just tickles the tongue. Its body has a medium to full feel and its texture is a little bit thick, almost chewy.

Notes: I found this Tripel to be just a little ruff around the edges, heavy and well, just a little bit above average. Im not sure if I just got a bad bottle or maybe it could use some more time to condition in the bottle or maybe less.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

 Not much aroma. Fruity, but not so complex as the Westmalle Triple (from the same tasting).

 Dry walnut like taste. Interesting, but not good.. Much better concealing the alcohol than the Westmalle Triple from the same tasting. Then again the Westmalle was 9.5% ABV.

Nothing special. Chunks in beer to me is gross, hence the low rating.

Well, just opened a bottle while listening to the national anthems being sung from Chicago.. That Jim Cornsomething rules. His version of the US anthem is the greatest version of ANY anthem Ive ever heard period. This has a BBD of 24 04 08 - this sucker is OLD! Heavily fruity now and excellent on that front - almost no spices to be found, fruits seem to be a mulled version of very ripe tropical fruits and, dare I say, a faint chocolate???, a bit fruit cakeish as well. Taste? Ill say rather excellent!  No banana that I claimed in the original review which must date back to early 2006, Notable malts, mild yeast and quite fruity. 4 years in the dark and this thing is very very good. Bump from 7474 15

Very hazy and I cant decide between brown, orange or yellow....lets just say weak metamucil...probally from all the sediment i swirled into the glass. Poured out a huge off white head that didnt last really long but has a good surface cover retention throughout. Lots of concrete-like messy lacing and a cloudy film from every swirl. The aroma is very nice and soft, which is probally what wins me over on this tripel. After the pour the smell consisted of a nice soft spice, some mild yeast and a lingering scent that could only remind me of weak rootbeer. That all fades and turns into a fruity aroma - mostly pear, slight spice, some noticable malts and some background dampness. Brew goes down really soft and smooth, meduim bodied and leaves a great aftertaste consisting of sourness, dryness and lingering yeast. The bitterness hits hard like it should and then fades out nicely. I must note at this point that my beer has been in the glass for well over 45 minutes - thanks Aqua Teen Hunger Force for distracting me : . Taste is really good. Seems complex while remaining soft at the same time. Plenty of yeast and mild clovish flavour. Dry mouth!!!! Fruits come around as banana and something else. Somewhat musty, but that seems to me to be tied in with the yeast. Bitterness is really hitting harder now that Im at the bottom of my glass...interesting brew - I keep changing my mind on what kind of score to give this....Im not sure if I am gassy, bloated or if I ate too many McCain Spicy Wedge Superfries.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Aroma of floral tropical fruits. Mild yeast and banana bread with just a hint of spices. More raisin and caramel comes in as this warms. Flavor is more bready and caramel influenced than the aroma hints at. Very soft. Still has some tropical fruits, but more of a raisin. Finishes with mild caramels, yeast, raisin, toffee cake, and an even mix of banana and tropical citrus. Some soft spices dry this out. Not a lot of aftertaste, just a light fruity cloying malt.

Aroma is apple juice with strong alcohol presence, wheat can be detected but alcohol dominates this sharp smelling beer. Sharp yeast and very noticeable alcohol comprise most of the taste , the alcohol seems way stronger than the 8% thats actually in it. The warmer the brew got the smoother it got and more darker bitter tasting malt flavors came out. The brew is one you cant slam back more of a sipping brew, taste way more harsh then most triples Ive had, it made my stomach feel very warm and I guess was disappointing compared to most of this style.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"

Served lightly chilled in chalice.
Pours a picturesque hazy orange gold body with a thick, creamy persistant white cap of foam.
Ripe fruits on the nose, apricot and peach come to mind, possibly some pineapple and banana. Bit of rich, sugary maltiness in the mix seems to deliver the message that this is a big beer, citrus, peppery and clovey phenols are lifting with temp rise.
Nice big mouthfeel, creamy with a lively carbonation. Quite a prominant drying mid-palate gives away its hefty abv.
Excellent body of flavour; perfume and peppery spice, stonefruits, bitter orange bringing forth a jolt of citric sharpness. Some malty sweetness in the works, finishing very dry, warming with a lingering clove spice.

This had some similar sour/funky flavor to their Abt 12 that I cant quite put my finger on. Taste is yeasty with some funk and green apple-like flavors.  Smooth palate, medium body.

Aroma is earthy citrus, fresh dough yeast, straw, spicy yeast, a little banana and some citrus tanginess. Flavor is grainy malt at first follwed closely by lots of toast and some caramel, then a little lemon. In the middle the toast and caramel remain dominant and more citrus notes move in, with some dark fruit and spicy yeast, which becomes more bread like rather quickly. Finish is grainy, toasty, citrus and spicy yeast. This stuff is what I would imagine a marzen brewed with Belgian yeast would be like-fantastic.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Ive enjoyed dozens of big and small bottles and many glasses on tap.  A world class tripel.  Years ago I had a blind tasting of 24 tripel-like beers and this was voted in the top 3 by the 9 tasters.
REVIEW Oct 4, 2013 - Im having a bottle dated best before 06-08-10, so probably from 2007.  There are some floaties at the bottom, but damn...Im going to have to up my ratings... near perfect in this style which Ill admit triples are one of my favorite styles outside the big hoppy world of beers.  And, this particular beer would be a strong contender with desert island top 10.  
Ill admit I represented this brewery in California in 2007 and had all the styles many times.  And Ill admit I enjoy this as much as the wonderful Abt 12.  Its similar to how I admire the Westvleteren 8 as much if not more than the 12.

After taste is dry with the sour fading out to a mild bitterness.  It has that wonderful Belgian yeast flavor that most brews from Belgium have but this one is different.

How: Tasting session at brothers place.  750ml Bottle, fresh.  Side-by-side St-Bernardus Tripel and St-Bernardus Watou Tripel
The look: Cloudy yellow-blonde body with a medium white head.
In long: Yet another great beer from St-Bernardus.  Fruity yeast and well malted.  Bready with bananas in crisp honey.  Side-by-side with her sister the St-Bernardus Watou Tripel the similarities were as apparent as the differences.  The Watou Tripel was going a bit more in the crisp sweet malt, crusty grandma lemon-pie.  This one is going more in direction of a Westmalle Tripel with a generous noble hopping.  A bit less complex but with a nice grassier taste and nice drier finish.  I couldnt decide which one I preferred.  This is a classic brewery interpreting a classic style in a classic fashion.

I found Waterzooi be a warm welcome home to the Europe I left last summer after my brothers wedding in Lyon, France. Among the neatly arranged taps was the smiling monk waiting for me..

The pretty bartender poured me a healthy goblet full of the butter colored ale, which led to the first taste without a thought....it was amazingly good. It was even greater than I had anticipated as I watched the rings of lacey foam decline into the glass.

The malty triple had more great tastes than Sybil had personalities.
I had the bizarre impression of bananas and milk shakes while I couldnt detect the alcohol at all.

Enjoy by 7/28/08

St. Bernardus Tripel pours a pale golden into its very own chalice. When held to the light it glows a bright yellow. Fair amount of floaties with many still left in the last 1/2 inch of beer in the bottle. Poured with a 1 finger white head that faded fairly quickly to a thin cap with spotty thick patches. Leaves some patchy spotted lacing with each drink that falls excruciatingly slow back into the body. Looks good.

Smell is complex but falls a little short compared with other St. Bernies. Big bread dough aromas coming forward along with candied orange peel. The yeats character comes through with a little dusty spiciness. I even detect the occasional cherry cordials, very faintly though. Very nice.

Taste is where its at with this tripel. The sip starts off with with the bread dough, lightly toasted bread and a handful of the candied fruits. This beer is an expierence for the tastebuds. A lot of very enjoyable flavors. Candy sugars and all the wonderful doughiness mix together to create an excellent beer. The perfect amount of residual sugars. Im really having a hard time breaking this down, very familiar flavors but at the same time new to me, very strange. Very good.

The body is medium, maybe a little on the lighter side. Good carbonation keeps things moving and is prickly on the tongue. No alcohol in the flavor but when the glass starts getting low my cheeks start getting a little warmer.

This is a beer I could honestly enjoy all day long. The carbonation and mild body help push this over the top. The more I drink the more I want. 

This is an excellent tripel from St. Bernardus and will definately see my fridge many more times in the future. Wish I had more on hand right now. Im kind of anxious to pick up some other tripels to review and compare. This one will be hard to beat. The most enjoyable Ive had to date.

Flavor starts spicey and with a strong carbonation note, has a nice gentle malt character that is consistent with the aroma, and ends with a dry, fast finsh and a subtle bitter note.

3247,"2006-12-30",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2009 BB 03-09. Pour is a hazy, nearly opaque, golden-copper color, with sediment; head is white, full, almost rocky-looking head which is mostly diminishing but leaves minimal nice lacing.  Nose is fairly fruity for a tripel; apple, honey, banana bread from light yeast notes, and faint floral and clove.  Honey and banana bread are dominant in the flavor with more floral presenting itself; lighter notes of sweet yeast notes, clove, and a sour flash just for a second.  Bitterness is there, but only to add depth.  Palate is more than medium, lively, and nearly creamy in texture, drying slightly.  Finishes sweet with banana esters and doughy yeast with some floral bitterness and at a moderate length with spicy phenols and faint warmth making a presence, lingering.  Decent tripel with all the nice traits, just nothing to set it apart from the greats.

Aroma: I was a bit stuffed up during this tasting so the scent was difficult for me to accurately determine.  What did come through was yeasty, wheat with fruity banana and apple with a nice hop scent.
Appearance: Hazy golden orange with small to medium bodied sediment floating throughout the beer.  For some this might be a turnoff but for me it just makes it interesting.  The head was a bright white in color that sustained somewhat throughout the glass.
Flavor: Quite yummy sweet yeast with the fruits again coming through nicely balanced with the hops.
Palate: Fnished nicely with a medium body and some bite along the roof of my mouth.  Not bitter or overly sweet either.  Balance is an important theme with this brew.

Field house meets flour dusted potato rolls.  Granary delight.  Sweet vanilla and almond minuet colonizes a brittle spiced banana scone, flakey at first chomp.  Light rosemary and rose petal harmony.  Perfect carbonation plays with a husky coriander motif for a blanketing starch ensemble that makes the heartland fear a usurping power across the pond.

Flavor delivers on the aromas promise, with the grassy, earthy, lightly flowery hops showing first, then a bit of light grain, and finally that sugary sweet malt.

Flavor was malty with a unfortunate cardboardy taste behind it all - somewhat musty. It started mildly sweet and finished somewhat bitter (but lacking a sharp hoppiness that should be in a tripel) with lingering apples and oranges in the aftertaste.

3247,"2006-04-28",4.5,"An excellent beer that, true to Belgian (and especially tripel) style, is sneaky in both the complexity of its flavor and the strength of its punch. Creamy and full-bodied, but dry, effervescent, and even refreshing in its finish. A bit underwhelming in its first impression, but then transforms almost magically on the palate into a parade of well-balanced flavors--the usual cast of yeast- and malt- derived fruits and spices with just the right amount of tartness and bitterness to balance it out.

I was surprised on pouring the beer by how tame (and disappointing at first) were both its initial aroma and head. The first estery/phenolic whiff of fruits and spices was plesant but subtle and short-lived. Rather than a thick rocky head, the beer produced large bubbles that supported only a thin layer. But its effervescence never died down, and that thin head proved to be long lasting and left behind a modest collection of Belgian lace. The first wave of flavor is likewise a bit underwhelming, if only because the tart (not astringent) tingling of carbonation dominates. But as the bubbles settle down in the mouth, they leave behind wave after wave of harmonious flavors--none of which are unfamiliar in a Belgian but nor does any single note dominate.","Los Angeles, California, USA","californiapete"

This did gain a few points from last rate, but it seems a little rough around the edges, a little harsh. [2006.03.09: 3.5]Re-rate, bottle best by 02 10 15.

Pours golden with above-average carbonation and a soapy bright white head.  Smoothish light-medium body, somewhat sugary but not all that sweet (certainly not cloying); has a bit of heat, perhaps more than Id like tonight, but still solid for a Tripel.  Slight tang and good candylike edges, not berries or other noticeable non-citrus fruit, but sticky lips with light vanilla and a good malt profile.  Very spicy, low bitterness.  This really has great harmony, a welcome step up from the disappointment I found in the Eight earlier tonight.  [2014.05.02: 4.0]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

3247,"2006-03-08",4.5,"I had this from a 750 ml corked and caged bottle.  There is a monk on the label and it says Belgian Abbey Ale and Watou on the label as well.  On the back it says, ""Best Before End: See Top So, I did.  Unfortunately the date did not get printed correctly on top of the cage.  I could make out the number 27 sitting on top of 5:22?!  You can also see the yeast sitting at the bottom of the bottle.  

I poured this into my St. Bernardus snifter.  This Triple is a cloudy golden color and it formed a nice thick foamy head.  It looked very inviting.

You can definitely smell the spicy aroma before it even gets to your nose.  There are hints of fruit and malt in the aroma as well.

There is a bit of a citrus bite upfront and then the spicy flavors come into play as it wanders around your teeth and gums.  As you swallow it, Wow!  You get a spicy fruity creamy flavor that just makes you want to have another swig.  It is very nicely carbonated and feels light and creamy on the palate.","Lithonia, Georgia, USA","rebelbrewer"

3247,"2006-01-23",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2007 St. Bernardus may be a faux-Trappist brewery, but that hardly makes them any less of a brewer.  Its quite the opposite, actually.  St. Bernardus with its avuncular monk has, to my personal tastes, risen above the traditional Trappists to make comparable or superior beers.  This especially holds true for the St. Bernardus Tripel, an obvious improvement over its blue-blood Westmalle cousin.  The aroma centers around the lighter and sweeter fruits, like apple and banana, and implements a little brown sugar for a cooked variant on the fruit smell.  The head is, like many other Tripels, cream colored and gently floats atop a faded dandelion colored and semi-cloudy beer.  The taste is rich and smooth, with a current of sweet flavors slowly transitioning to a toastier bread taste.  The texture conforms perfectly to the taste, and allows the Tripel, sometimes an overpowering drink, to get taken down an eager gullet.  Im usually a fan of the dictum where food is concerned, that the original or genuine brand is the best.  However, this is certainly not the case with St. Bernardus: it may not be an official monastic community of Christian beer minded men, but it brews up a good drink all the same.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3247,"2006-01-21",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2007 Jan 21 06. Relatively fresh bottle.
Pours a lightly hazy gold with floaty bits and a fine and  long-lasting white head. The aroma is belgian yeast and lemon, with a bit of leather. The flavor is a full, rich belgian tripel: orange and lemon, honey, mild spices on the uptake, turning somewhat sour and then with a hint of alcohol burn leading into a pleasingly dry finish. Mouthfeel is finely carbonated and lively, the liquid buttery but not cloying. 
A pretty impressive beer. 8/3/8/4/16=3.9

Dec 12 07 Roughly two-year-old bottle. 
This time around Im much less. Banana esters dominate the nose; some orange blossom, some pear. Honey (flavor, not sweetness) dominates the front end of the taste profile; an elegant subtle bittering closes it (that is one nice detail) nudged gently by hints of sour. But the flavor itself seems thin and weak. I can feel the heat here but Im not getting flavor to match. Id have rated this 7/3/7/3/13=3.3, a pretty low-ball rating for this beer. Ill shade the original downward somewhat but Im not willing to pull it even half way until I try another fresh bottle and feel similarly. Hard to tell whether my previous rating was naive and overly generous, or whether this simply ages poorly.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Flavor starts well with subdued crackerjack caramel and nuts, honey, malted milk balls, flowers, and galangal (a white-peppery/gingery spice). The beer finishes off-dry, again with earth and spice; also chammomile and hyacinth, and a tame leafy bitterness. Medium-light body is airy, gritty, and electric with needle-sharp carbonation. The CO2 accentuates an annoying blood-iron tang that remains on the tongue and erases the beers more pleasant assets. Begins nicely, but is overwhelmed by metallic taste.

3247,"2006-01-15",3.6,"St. Bernardus is one of my favorite breweries, so I couldnt pass up the opportunity to try their take on the Tripel - a style which Im growing to like more and more. Pouring into my trappist goblet produced an opaque titian tint topped of an airy cobweb-like head. As the foam quickly fizzed away, bubbly lacing was left clinging to the glass. The nose is sweet and full of the common esters: banana, bubble gum and pineapple. Some citrus fruits such as orange and mandarin appear subsequently in combination with mango, apple, caramel, biscuits and pepper. Truly a mouth-watering fragrance! The flavor was more lucid than I anticipated, losing some of its fruitiness to grains, especially corn and wheat. Honey, banana and some citrus are still present but seem a bit dilute. The alcohol is not aggressive but definitely present in the taste, giving a fairly full-bodied texture even though the flavor is a bit watered down. I was a little disappointed with St. Bernardus effort on this one but it is still a great beer that leaves a smooth and refreshing aftertaste in the mouth and a pleasant warming in the stomach.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3247,"2005-09-10",4.6,"I think Ill go with the 12-oz. bottles from here on out.  The 25-ozers are not quite balanced in their effect.  You have to get to about mid-bottle before the proper viscosity is attained, and once it is, its heavenly.  The aroma is mild but sophisticated.  The rest is simply divine when you get mid-25 oz.  The first third of the bottle is too full of carbonation and the liquid is moderately clear.  Then you finally get to the cloudy gold portion and its unbelievable, just what I crave in a Tripel.  Deep cloudy gold with lovely foam head, and then a fruity delivery.  Egregiously well-balanced between hop and malt, and some banana flavoring.  Smooth and creamy to the point of criminality.  The final third of the 25-oz bottle should be declared illegal its so decadent.  Im speaking purely figuaratively here, of course, being a radical libertarian in politics.

Intense smokey toffee and candi sugar sweetness dominated the low fruity esters, unusual nuttiness and alcohol and pepper spices. Similar in the mouth, sweet candi sugar was dominant, but balanced out with a mild peppery spice.

Soft, yet earthy, hoppy, full-bodies, and delicious.
An excellent tripel, for the sugary aspect was much more subdued than other offerings which misinterpreted, perhaps, the portions of the sweetness in the style. Seemed nothing more, or less, than perfect, without being mindblowing.

Smell: Massive array of citrus fruits...from pear to peach, apricot to mango, mango to star fruit....followed up by strong peppery and flower phenols...

Taste: quite similar to the smell....a robust citrus fruit appeal, follewed by a well introduced Mr. Yeast...banana seemed to makes its impression as well....nice cider like feel with a vinegar malty backbone....just great complexity

I stick by my previous impressions. A very solid tripel. Poured with a huge, slightly off-white head. This has a yeasty, sour lemon smell. The appearance is a hazy, light copper. The flavor is much sweeter than the aroma would indicate. It has ginger, clove and banana. The sweetness is subtle.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

3247,"2004-04-03",4.9,"2001 bottle (from what I can guess from the notches on the smiling monk label) - Gorgeously thick and clouded dull orangey-yellow color that you cannot see through what so ever; very syrupy thick body with a very tall off-white, meringue-like, speckled froth that sits on top for a good while before finally settling to a healthy murk of a skim on top that keeps its hold mounting on top for a good time. Great lacing in thickly sticking foamy strings. 

Lovely aroma of well rounded deep fruityness bringing in super dulled citrus(citrus without the sour citrus) of orange and lemon, some passion fruit, banana, dried apricots, and pineapple notes intermingle. Way yummy and candy-licious! Very soft musty, yeasty spices barely make an appearance, which I like, most Belgian Triples seem to have way too much of that plastic/phenol yeast thing that doesn't bold well with me. This is soft and subtle, fruity and candy-like, more to my liking. Not overly strong but oh so yummy to wiff in. Great subtle fruits and softness to its nose! Tropical fruit salad any one?

Oh my...and the taste follows suit from the smell. Huh? Wow! This is yummy! The tropical fruityness is fabulous to my tastes; soft, full, bold, yet biting, all that was noted in the smell comes across in the tastes. Great fruits of dulled down orange and lemon with some pineapple and banana. Super fine creamyness and fullness. Mild as all hell yeast and spice just barely make an entrance peeking even more interest within the flavors. Maintains a strangely interesting finish of chocolate and caramel malty thickness which covers over the fruits later on, quite amazing! Far and away one of the best Triples I've enjoyed! Thick, lush, flavorful in fruits and candy action! Yum, yum, yum, this stuff rocks! I haven't had many Triples cuz most I've had I didn't like, but this St. Bernardus is mind boggling yummy!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

With minimal lacing, the lace floats on top reminiscent of mold growing on stale bread. (clumped together in small round 'spots') This beer has a gorgeous strong aroma, very appealing but fades fast, leaving you struggling to place the scents.

It was sharp at first but then after the first swallow became quite watery with no real after taste.

There is some spiciness in the nose too.  Very well put together triple, there is a certain softness/ roundness from the malt that ties this beer together very well.

Most pronounced was the presence of bubblegum over and above the yeasty/spicy/fruity tripel base.  Particularly true in the aroma but stronger in the flavor as it warms.  Smooth palate, alcohol less pronounced than in the Maredsous, and less bubbly as well.  Nice appearance, hazy golden--slightly darker (the orange dimension boosted) than the Maredsous.

I tried not to disturb the thick layer of sediment as I poured the first couple glasses. Fairly clear golden ale with an orange hue. Sizable white head settles down to a creamy layer of foam. Aroma is sweet and fruity and like most Tripels Ive had. Flavor has a distinct citrus character, lemon and orange come to mind. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel that goes down real smooth. Alcohol is well hidden. The last glass I poured inevitably contained some yeast sediment. This glass was really cloudy and the overall flavor was less enjoyable. Id recommend trying to leave the sediment in the bottle. This is a great Tripel that seems to be widely available.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"

7.5%ABV, poured into a Corsendonk tulip.

An energetic beer, pours with a generous white head that diminished, but lingered. 
Deep golden color, slight haze, but impressive looking all around.

Flora notes in nose? Citrus? Phenol spice and maybe a bit of Saaz spice.

Firm bodied bier.  Malt in the flavor, I get a bit of vanilla in there from the yeast.  Becomes sweeter as it warms and the CO2 depletes.  The yeast is all over this baby.  Hops are restrained, but apparent. It is tough to tell if I'm getting some Saaz or if that's the yeast in the finish.
In comparison, similiar to the New Belgium Trip, but less corriander and less hop bitterness.  Should have done a side by side with them.
Alcohol becomes more apparent as the beer warmed, especially in the finish.

Aroma initially is musty and lightly malty; slight hop aromas and a little fruity and clovey.  The flavor is grapey and acidic; clove flavor seems to be absent and finishes dry with an oddly sweet/metallic.  Fruitiness is balanced and sort of overwhelmed by tart acidity and yeasty flavors as well.  The body is light and the carbonation is high, typical of a tripel, but something in this beer was just off.  I'm thinking it was slightly infected(bacterial) and the alcohol was a little more than warming. It was actually hot and seemed a little higher than 7.5% ABV.  It was also astringent.  I'd rate this beer another time to give it another chance, this was definitely not a good bottle to rate.

3247,"2002-12-26",3.9,"Straw-orangey colour. Thick creamy head. Nose of special malts, coriandre and blue cheese. Yeasty.
Taste: bitter, spicey (coriandre again). Very obvious underlying sweetness. Rich mouthfeel; alcohol impression, but not much. 
Tasted example is 75cl Cuvée 2002. no real indication of any difference with the usual 33cl.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
3247,"2002-12-22",3.6,"Golden color, small creamy head. Small yeast particles floating around. Smells a bit sour, yeasty. Candy sugar is very present in taste and aroma. Thick body for a triple, very sweetsour. Its a quite distinct taste seen also in the other St Bernardus brews. In the darker brews i really loved it, but in this triple brew im not quite amazed. I am missing the spices and/or malts in this triple.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
3247,"2002-12-20",3.9,"Great aroma with a golden color. Delicious yeasty flavor with a beautiful hop tone.","Florida, USA","bugbbq99"
3247,"2002-12-19",3.9,"A tiny bit cloudy dark blond beer with a medium, disappearing head. Yeasty, sweet, slightly malty aroma. The taste is yeast, hop and some alcohol. Fairly lively palate with a slightly bitter finish. It is a rather yeasty beer. I like it.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
3247,"2002-12-01",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2003 Classic tripel nose with sunny fruits and some alcohol.  The flavor is rather tight green apple with some woody notes providing interesting relief.  Very tough not to love a beer with a label this cool.  Thin bead of head persists.  Very nice stuff.  Update:  My last sample had a rather substantial caramel base which supported the fruit flavors very nicely.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"

3247,"2002-11-21",4.8,"Re-Rate 11/21/02: The beer pours a tenebrous orangish-yellow color, the head behemothic in size, texture that of whipped cream and the color a dazzlingly white with enormously thick glutinous sheets of lace that clean mightily to the glass. 
Nose is yeast laden, malt, hints of lemon peel, with and underlying sweetness. Front is ambrosial, the top middling in feel, the finish is devilishly carbonated, divinely hopped droughty long lasting aftertaste. This bottle borders on being 2 years old, the high ABV is quite evident in the Belly Warming, and the deep malt body adds much to this beer. Oddly enough, seems people either love it or dislike it, I Love it!","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
3247,"2002-11-19",4.0,"Wheat colored body with a white, diminishing head.
Doughy, sour nose.
Spicy first bite with a sour finish. Slight hops bitterness.
Some lacing. More lemon in the mouth as the beer approaches room temp.
Lots of fruit after the beer warms up. Strong too! Nice.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bender"
3247,"2002-11-11",3.6,"Treble coulour, the typical colour of a trappist tripel.  Malt aroma.  No pronounced palate, but still rather bad.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
3247,"2002-11-09",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2004 Deep golden color.  Fruity - a subtle apricot(?) flavor.  medium bodied, sweet/dry finish.  Thick candy sugar on the tongue as it warms.  maybe subtle for the style.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
3247,"2002-11-04",3.6,"Medium dark golden body, medium white head, mild spicy, fruity nose with a touch of alcohol. Flavor is full and fruity, but lacks the spicy bite that I prefer from a tripel. Malty and sweet. Minimal alcohol presence.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"

3247,"2002-10-12",3.7,"This one is not a bad one, although not the best tripel. It tastes a bit hoppy, and also bitter, the colour is not completely blonde, a bit more orange...","Oostende, BELGIUM","SteC"
3247,"2002-10-12",3.9,"Weak on the nose. Long lasting head. Fruity pineapple taste. Acidic. Not as good as the 12.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","Allseeingeye"

3247,"2002-10-04",3.6,"Tasted with the 8 and 12 which were much preferred.  Nice flavor, but lite finish.","Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, USA","gbzia"
3247,"2002-09-28",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2004 Draught: The colour reminds me of a summertime sunset. Has a cloudy head, that last long. The aroma is not as distinct as other Strong ales, i've tasted. A little weak. Flavour is wellbalanced and smooth. Suited the roasted lamb, with which it was served, perfect.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
3247,"2002-09-09",3.5,"[4 years old bottle]  Hazy amber colour, thick yoghurt-like head. Dry aroma, malt, old hops. Smooth, well balanced, strong malt and bitterness, pretty strong palate. Doesnt ages well, must try a fresh one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

3247,"2002-08-08",3.8,"Had the look of a hefe at first. Cloudy golden color, head fades to lace.Aroma tells the tale though. Citrus fruit dominates with a little banana if Im correct. Tart on the tongue with a bit of sourness.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"

Re-rate: LOTS of yeast and a bit of pepper in the aroma. flavor has some prune and fig notes with a definitely nuttiness in the finish..walnut or pecan.","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"
3247,"2002-07-18",4.1,"I had this one right after the St-Bernardus 12.  I like this one a bit less but it still has the same complexity.  It seemed a bit more fruity, with big citrus notes.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"
3247,"2002-07-17",4.3,"I like this beer a bit better than the Abt. A little lighter on the palate but the same great tropical fruits and bready qualities.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Jayb0"
3247,"2002-07-04",3.8,"Sharp, strong citrus taste with distinctive malt flavor.  Rather sweet finish as well.  The initial aroma promises well and the beer generally delivers on this promise albeit weaker than the higher ranked Chimays.","Cordova, Tennessee, USA","kumite56"

Finish is somewhat acidic, although still citrusy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
3247,"2002-06-20",4.0,"In the mix of mass tripel tasting in Brussles this one held its own. A bit more of a toffee caramel flavor than most tripels and a littel less of the spicy sharp flavor and mouthfeel.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"

3247,"2002-02-07",3.7,"Very light body indeed.  Beautiful, huge white head on this.  Only 7.5% makes this one of the weaker tripels I have sampled, but none the less this is a good beer.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
3247,"2002-01-15",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2008 A very soft mouthfeel.  Rosewater and tangerines. Taste is fruity, grainy and herbal.  The head is as good as a head can look.  It never fades.  At a mere 7.5%, this beer is amazingly quaffable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3247,"2001-11-30",3.4,"Quite surprised looking at the other rating comments. I think this was promissing in the aroma, but disappointing in the taste. Maybe some rated the 9% version here? The aroma is great, like a field of flowers in spring. Looks good too with a golden and bit orange colour, nice head but not as firm as I like. The flavors are flowers again and malts but it lacks a good character. It doesnt feel good, sparkling and not sticky. It finishes malty with some sweetness.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
3247,"2001-10-14",2.5,"My first beer of the night last night and what a disappointment. Bland and boring, much like the La Trappe i also had last night. Weak flavors, fair aroma of fruit, nothing much else.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"
3247,"2001-09-26",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2008 Dark gold with a very slight haze.  Slightly sugary malts on the nose with light spice, pear and peach. Soft body.  The alcohol makes a statement early, but the brew turns sweet, almost cloying, before spice and peachy fruit finish u.  Smells Belgian, drinks American.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3247,"2001-08-27",4.4,"Incredible triple unlike any other out there. With the warming of the glass you get all kinds of aromas just roaring out. This one is a sipper though.Earlier Rating: 8/20/2001 Total Score: 4.7Terrific beer people! Michael Jackson gives the best description:
Almost iridescent, orange colour; the aroma of rosewater; suprisingly light on the tongue for such a strong beer; a palate that suggest vanilla, cookies and sesame seeds; and a tangerine-like finish.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","trappist12"
3247,"2001-08-16",3.6,"Its tastes much better then the label looks. You would expect a terrible fake-Westmalle or something like that, but it has its own style.","Rozenburg, NETHERLANDS","Einned99"
3247,"2001-06-29",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2003 Starts malty, fruity, finishes slightly dry with alcohol warmth. Notes of tangerine, apple, pear, woddiness, spice. Well balanced and flexible. Would work as summertime refresher or late nightcap.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
3247,"2001-03-27",4.4,"Definitely one of the stronger triples, both in terms of spice and alcohol flavor.  This is not a beginners beer.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"
