2351,"2016-09-01",3.7,"750 ml bottle from Trigs in Wausau, WI, opened a bit below cellar temp and poured into a Maudite glass. Well, a bit of it poured - it opens with a good pop and pours a bit gout of off-white foam, slow-decaying atop a luminous orange-gold, opaque body....I definitely get the chardonnay in the nose, which is vinous, slightly tart and fairly sweet, with a bit of oaky character and a fair amount of fresh doughy yeastiness; citric hops are present but never dominate...body is moderately sweet at the front, yeasty, moving on to lightly dry and quite tart, bitter and somewhat astringent towards the finish, with peppery notes and a fair amount of alcohol, though for me its only a touch too boozy and only at the finish - in the body its merely warming. Body is supple enough, moderately carbonated - just enough really to keep things light on the palate. I can see how the finish on this one would kill it for some people, it really is on the harsh side, but it isnt that damaging to me - enough to keep this from getting over a 4 I guess. The description focuses on the hops - which really arent all that apparent - and calls it a tripel; I think the current designation of Belgian strong works pretty well. My first beer from this brewery and state.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

2351,"2016-08-03",4.4,"750ml bottle [10.6% abv]. Milky, orangey golden colour with huge, thick, creamy, mostly lasting, superbly lacing, white head. Vinous and fruity aroma, minimally bready and biscuity malty background, notes of dried yellow stone fruit, peach and apricot. Taste is initially moderately sweet fruity, minimally bready and biscuity malty, notes of peach, apricot, hints of honey, then the 87 IBUs become more and more noticeable with tremendous bitterness and citrusy as well as  floral hop flavours, notes of grapefruit, cautious hints of pineapple, a tropical fruity touch; on top mild vestiges of the Chardonnay BA add woody, tannic, fruity nuances with a touch of silica and white grapes: Creamy texture, gentle, lively carbonation. If I had been sceptical about the balance of an 87 IBU Belgian Strong Ale I must admit now: except for the first sips initial hop punch that nearly had effectuated a knock out, the malty backbone is optimally endowed to cope with such a disquieter. Rich, manifold, complex. Its not only that you find new solo flavour nuances with every sip - new combinations come to mind in addendum (e.g. peach-honey or white grape-sugar powder. Awesome stuff!

2351,"2015-09-11",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Great Taste of the Midwest on August 08. Recommended by Aly of Goose Island as we were talking about a number of things. The pour is a dark gold with a small head that just lasts and lasts. The aroma is heavy on hops. There is also a resounding dankness that melds well with all of the vinous grape scents that come from the barrel. There is a nice oakiness on the back end and a little spice. The flavor is also very hoppy for what I was expecting. The grapes and Chardonnay come through in force once you swallow it and its pretty well received. The mouth feel is thick and creamy, with a soft carbonation and a bitterness that just lingers. There is a little sweetness on the back end, but for the most part, this was just a great recommendation. Thanks Aly!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

A: Pours a hazy amber color. The head is a one finger white shade. While its retention isnt the best, its both beautifully creamy and leaves a decent ring of lacing on the glass.

S: Very fruity. Intensely fruity, actually. Apples, grapes, pears, oranges, and grapefruit all intertwine on the nose, with a building bubblegum character coming out the more it warms up. The barrel character is moderately strong without being overpowering. One disappointing feature is that I dont pick up much hoppiness, apart from some of the citrusy characteristics blending within the esters. Otherwise, this is an excellent example of a barrel aged tripel, at least on the nose.

T: From the start, the esters hit the palate immediately with strong bubblegum, apple, and pear. Its on the finish where the hop profile makes itself known. Theyre more citrusy than piny, and thats good. The finish is also loaded with a clean oak characteristic - this feature is actually quite powerful, almost overly so. Wait not almost, definitely overly so. The toasted oak flavors run roughshod everything else when sufficiently warmed up. Getting past that, its a solid brew.

M: Surprisingly on the clean side, with the barrel characteristics doing a good job of drying it out. The tannins are a bit harsh, actually - its too dry in my mind. On the plus side, theres very little in the way of prevalent alcohol. 

O: Clearly, this isnt much of an IPA, Belgian-style or otherwise: the hops are only a slight addition here, playing second fiddle to the barrel character. This is a perfect example of an over-barreled beer - the base beer pretty much cowers in fear of the chardonnay barrels. Its a reasonable beer, but considering how much this brewery charges, Im having a lot of trouble recommending this one (except to barrel lovers, that is).","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

2351,"2014-09-13",4.4,"""My favorite in a line of really really good Nebraska beers last night. I didnt know what to expect from the chardonnay barrels as Ive had everything from mellow soft and buttery, to light apple, to sour. This had a light tropical fruitiness and a coconut aspect to the barreling that has been noticed in bourbon aged beers like Bruery White Oak. The aroma is tantalizing fruits and coconut, oak and hops. The hops are subdued but not covered by the barreling and their presence put this one over the top compared to the Melange (same barrels).

Hazy amber body, good sized creamy off-white head and lace. 3+ Vinous aroma has a good amount of the chardonnay barrel present, muted hops and malt. 7+ Flavour is similar, fruity, vinous white wine character, mild wood and wood tannins, moderate bitterness throughout, mild malt. Lingering alcohol in a fairly dry finish. Average plus bodied palate is pleasantly effervescent. The barrel dominates the flavour profile, and the hops are fairly restrained, I suspect a combination of the age of the bottle and the barrel aging.

2351,"2012-08-22",2.9,"My Bottom Line :  
Subtle iodine mars this Barrel-Aged Double IPAs citric and grape-y fruitiness, as alcohol heat and honeyed malts attempt to whip up a comforting brew.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A creamy head of foam covers the hazy pale amber.
-Hop bitterness is redolent of conifers.
-That aroma sure is not appealing, even more so for a style supposed to showcase bright hops!
-At this hefty price, you just cannot allow yourself to bottle a brew with any faults. Im not buying anything from them at this price again, thats for sure.

The beer appears crystal clear and light orange in color. The head stands in at approximately an inch thick, and displays lasting retention. As the cap recedes it leaves a healthy dose of lacing on the glass. The aroma is really wonderful, with a lot of barrel scents coming through prominently. The flavor is very good, but not quite up to the level of the aroma. The taste is very tannic, as the wine barrels really shine through. The hop aspect is there, but is a bit overshadowed by the French Oak Chardonnay barrel. That being said, the beer is pretty well balanced, and surprisingly drinkable for what it is. Frankly, I did not expect to enjoy a barrel-aged IPA this much. The feel is medium bodied with a solid carbonation level. A blend of hops and barrels lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer is complex and interesting, and I would certainly have it again. Best shared and / or enjoyed in small quantities.

2351,"2012-01-04",3.5,"Pretty nice looking, orange-ish tan colored and mostly clear, fairly good white head and not bad lace.  Smell is very sour-like, notable chardonnay and wood, malt and hops arent as strong as I suspected but make a nice appearance.  Tastes like a kind of strange, earthy sour. Hops are noticeable but Im not sure why this is a ""God"" of the hop.  Definitely woody notes. A good malt base that makes it enjoyable and tries to balance out the kind of overbearing barrel aging. You kind of catch the hops on the backbite, second half of the swig.  Body is smooth and luscious, very enjoyable, especially as it warmed. Pretty thick and full bodied despite the color and style. Mild tang and warming from the alcohol. Bitterness is pretty high but is somewhat masked by a sweet finish.  Its quite likeable, though a bit odd and Im not sure what style/category it should really be in. However, if you like sours or you like chardonnay (as I like both a lot), definitely try this one for a special occasion sometime, with sophisticated beer drinkers ONLY.

2351,"2011-07-05",4.3,"In short: Topical fruits, white wine barrels, rustic dank cellar and a ton of grapefruity/lemony hops.  Excellent and unique.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed one month after purchase but this kind of fancy pricey bottle may have been sitting there for 6 months.
The look: Cloudy golden blonde body topped by a medium off-white head with medium retention
In long: Nose has plenty of white wine barrels, tropical fruits, freshly cut grass.  Overall there was something about the aroma that I would describe as dank cellar that gave the beer aroma a bit of a rustic semi-wild edge.  Very intriguing aroma.  Taste is an original mix of white wine barrel aged blonde Belgian ale with a whole lot of high-alpha-acid grapefruity and lemony American hops.  The wine barrels were perfectly integrated and didnt grab all the palate attention, plenty of pineapples and other tropical fruits as well as some yellow not-too-ripe bananas.  Also some countryside flowers.  The biting bitter grapefruity/lemony hops were almost overwhelming and reminded me of the Port Brewing Mongo that I had the a few days before.  This is a great original beer.  The only problem with this beer is the price, but I bought a bottle anyway because I treat each day as if it was my only day on earth.

Head is average size, bubbly/frothy/ rocky, with good lacing and legs and is mostly lasting. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and lightly acidic, and finishes lightly to moderately acidic and moderately to heavily bitter.  Palate is medium, almost creamy with a lively carbonation and a moderately alcoholic finish. A very well rounded example of this style with almost perfect balance in the flavor, but the $22 a bottle is a little disappointing and knocked down the overall score a bit.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
2351,"2010-05-20",4.5,"First rate in awhile. I felt the beer deserved it. A rare re-purchase at $25/750. Aroma seamlessly weaves equal notes of citrus, dough, oak, and fruity chardonnay. Flavor is sweet-fruity up front but develops a complimentary tartness (orangey tartness, not lacto tartness) to balance the sweetness. Bitterness level may be hefty, though it comes across as fairly mild amidst the sweeter notes from the malt, yeast, and chardonnay. Full bodied but not overwhelmed with sticky sugar. Soft carbonation, appropriate with all the subtler fruit notes. Didnt get any funky notes other raters have mentioned. A real winner of a beer from a barrel not often seen in the beer world. Well, well worth it.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

Apricot and hops and then a hint of sour which led me to think Brett. Do I dare compare this to Temptation? YES! 

 Lightly sour with a wonderful malt base. Some sweet and tart flavors, possibly a good intoduction to sour ale, as the sour notes compliment the hops nicely.

Smell is wonderful, light sweet notes, very light oak, sugar, hints of fresh squeezed hops, and some mellow honey and citrus..

Taste will absolutely blow you away. amazing stuff, from the sturdy hop presence, to the light honey, to the fun yeast/oak flavours; this is just to hard to describe without doing this beer justice! 

not only that but the mouthfeel for a beer of this caliber is untouchable.. smooth as silk, with not even a hint of the 10%.. the abv is hiding so well you should check your pockets..

ALL and all this beer is just amazing..
I want it again and again and drinking it with new friends made it that much better..
