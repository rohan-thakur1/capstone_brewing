1530,"2017-06-15",3.6,"2017/06/15 - Pours a cloudy, orange straw colour with a fluffy, white head that slowly dissipates and leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, biscuit malt, yeast, citrus peel, grass and floral/herbal hops. Taste is citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange), herbal hops, peppery notes and biscuit malt. ABV well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium with lightly biting carbonation and a drying, mildly chalky finish. Not what I was expecting, but I found this refreshing and highly drinkable.

1530,"2017-06-10",3.8,"Can from the LCBO. Cloudy pale gold under a slow fading fluffy white head. Nose is primarily citrus with grapefruit dominant along with a wheat background. Also has lighter notes of yeast and pepper. Very light sweet start with a light to medium bitterness and a light tartness in the finish. Mouth is medium- with average carbonation. Not a typical wheat.

Jai dabord cru quil sagissait dune saison, par ses notes levurées à la belge. Un houblin fruité aux notes de pêche et dagrumes sema par la suite le doute dans mon esprit. Sans doute une bière dinspiration belge avec un dry-hop bien américain. Oui cest sûrement ça. Je goûte. À lattaque, une douce dose dépices se conjugue aux houblins fruités. Leffervescence se mêle de la partie mais sestompe abruptement pour ne laisser quun liquide plutôt mort parcourir mon oesophage.

Au nez, cest assez sucré et fruité, avec notamment des odeurs de pamplemousses roses. En bouche cest très amer, avec un houblonnage que je présume assez impressionnant, en début de dégustation. Au fil des gorgées, un profil plus fruité, voir floral, sinstalle. Lamertume sèche et solide nous rappelle définitivement le moment où lon croque un pamplemousse.

1530,"2016-08-21",3.6,"Got a mini growler at the new brewery. Pours a dull light amber colour with slight cloudiness and has barely any head to it. Has some nice floral hops aromas with hints of nutmeg. Flavours are sort of on the grapefruit side, not very tangy. Also citrus and herbal hops round out the slightly sweet flavours. Watery mouthfeel at first and also a bit prickly. Medium bodied and good carbonation. 6% abv is not noticeable in this brew. Not too bad and pretty easy to drink. Seems to be a nice summer type beer.

I definitely get the grapefruit. Taste is not quite sweet and moderately bitter, offers more citrus and zest. Light sweetness in the finish. Body is medium and carbonation moderate.

Hop-bitter and grapefruit rind aftertaste, a grapefruit rind finish. Mysterious in its own way, yet pretty good beer.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Papillon"

The appearance to the beer isnt great. Fairly cloudy but does give a nice head. The nose is very wheaty. I expected a completely different taste as I was thinking of other fruit infused beers which are full of artificial sugary flavouring. The taste is very wheaty, but has a little grapefruit zest which brings on some bitterness to make it very drinkable.

Grapefruit zest and tropical fruitiness from hops sit upon cushy wheat in this quenching brunch beer.

-Drinkability is very high despite the fact the beer could be drier, to my tastes.
-Hops also share a peppery touch.
-Hops and grapefruit zest are perfectly harmonious.

Taste is a bitter citrus - the grapefruit is there thorather as a supporting role than a main player. Fine it a try if you come across out but really only available in the brewery locale!","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","Nilz"
1530,"2013-02-04",3.3,"Growler sample via BreWedge. Pink gold in colour with moderate carbonation. Aromas are of grapefruit, malted wheat, and herbal hops. Flavors are of bread dough, grapefruit and orange, along with some vague kitchen herbs. Solid bitterness and pithy dryness provide a snappy finish, but the dough-like quality of the wheat somewhat bogs down what would be an otherwise light and refreshing beverage. Still pretty good overall.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1530,"2013-01-27",3.5,"From a 64 Oz growler.  Pours a slightly hazy yellow with small, creamy, white head.  Both taste and aroma were grapefruit dominant with a hint of grain.  Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel.  Medium length, astringent finish owing to the bitterness imparted by the grapefruit.  Not a complex brew but very sessionable.","goose bay, Newfoundland, CANADA","BreWedge"
1530,"2013-01-23",3.5,"Thanks to PaleAleRider for this one (he got at the brewery and shared). Pours a hazy golden colour with hardly no head. Some lace appears as the brew goes down. Malty nose with grapefruit (hop) notes and oranges. With time, hints of spices (ginger, nutmeg). Refreshing mouthfeel with a little bitterness creating nice dryness in the finish. Decent cereal grains with the mild hop again (grapefruit). Orange and grain lingers into the aftertaste. Changes into overall citrus. This is a nice different ale. Was expecting it to be pink, but was not. Thought it was a fruit beer, but no. Much more bitter than what the IBU (20) gave out to be, all because the grapefruit zest and pulp was added. Nice !","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
1530,"2013-01-13",3.4,"From a growler poured the the day before at the brewery.   Rather faint aroma. Hazy light orange colour with a thin head.   Lightly carbonated.  The grapefruit flavour is rather subtle and makes this resemble an APA.  Itll make a nice summer beer.","","WilderPegasus"
1530,"2013-01-12",3.8,"A pinkish hazed golden ale with a thin lacing white head. In aroma, a really nice pungent ale with grapefruit pulp and floral catty hops, resinous, very nice. In mouth, a smooth ale with resinous hops, citrus, lighter bodied but a great quaffer. A good surprise.  On tap at Arrow and Loon, Dec. 5 2012.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1530,"2012-12-10",3.6,"Growler acheté à BTP. 6.5% Couleur jaune foncée-ambrée un peu voilée, mousse blanche mince. Arôme dagrumes de fruits et malt. En bouche, plus houblonnée que la wheat typique, notes de pamplemousse, houblons et grains de blé. Finale avec une légère amertume, petite acidité...se boit à grande lampée. Un peu atypique et très bonne.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","sseb69"
1530,"2012-12-05",3.3,"I enjoyed this although it really doesnt fit into a specific category. Pours a hazy gilden witha slight pink hue. Aroma is grapefruit with a smal wheat. Taste isa real nice grapefruit and a small wheat chewiness. Fun beer.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
1530,"2012-12-01",2.8,"Mini growler picked up from the brewery. Hazy orange with an off white head. Grapefruit pulp with a bit of zest but it requires a fair amount of sniffing to get it, very slight wheat and not too much else; mild carbonation and body, plain but light sweetness on the palate, becomes dry with a bit of grapefruit again on the finish.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
