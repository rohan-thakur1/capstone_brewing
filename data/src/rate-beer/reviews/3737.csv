3737,"2014-03-14",3.8,"On tap at Princeton. Deep mahogany red color. Small creamy beige head. Slight nutty malt aroma. Bittersweet toasted malt upfront. Light biscuit and brown sugar nuances. Low carbonation yields a silky smooth mid taste. Light bitter peppery finish and aftertaste. Very nice.","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"
3737,"2010-02-15",3.8,"Regular CO2 tap- no nitro at New Hope.  Pours a nice clear bright copper amber with a really nice lasting head- and good lace.  Aroma is light nutty, good sweet not sharp caramel, toast, ligth biscuit and a really nice fruity nose- ester and hoppy fruits.  Flavor is smooth caramel malts, light sweet molasses, some honey, lightly toasted bread, nuts, earth, moderately sweet all the way through but finishes smooth and a bit drier than the middle.  Really easy drinking- one of the best ""Irish Reds"" or amber ales for that matter I have ever had.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3737,"2009-12-11",3.0,"Nitro.  Pours an amber body with an off white head.  Bitter, earth tones, some light citrus, caramel malts, with a light wood note.  Appleish tones and a bitter finish.  Okay.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
3737,"2009-07-08",3.2,"Had this one on draught at the Triumph location in downtown Philadelphia.  Cloudy, dark red pour with a tan head, a mild caramel nose, malty and a touch of nuttiness, nice.","Saint Charles, Illinois, USA","gws57"
3737,"2009-03-20",3.5,"On draft at the Philly location. The pour was amber colored, full sized head for the style, off-white-ish. The aroma was caramel, toffee, some fruity notes. The flavor followed suit, a generally dry presentation, good hop-malt balance, flavors on the lighter side: grains, fruity esters, toast, earthy hops. The body was moderate to light for the style.","","User37895"
3737,"2009-03-06",3.9,"The best Irish Red that I have tasted.
Easily better than Killians in my opinion.
I also prefer this to Smithwicks.
 Has a caramel malt flavor.","New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania, USA","Cakes"
3737,"2008-10-29",3.6,"Had on draft at the New Hope PA location.  It pours a ruby red in color with very minimal head.  The aroma is light, fruity and floral.  Flavors are of sweet ripe fruits, cane sugar, and a bit of a toasted grain note.  It has a medium body, and a clean finish.  Another great beer from a great local place.","Hamilton Twp., New Jersey, USA","NJBeerman013"
3737,"2008-06-04",3.2,"Draft. Poured brown/red with an off white head. Caramel malt and ripe fruit aroma. Medium body. Flavor is caramel malt with a light roasty character, followed by a dry finish. Pretty good.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
3737,"2008-04-14",3.6,"Nice, though a bit watery. Creamy with a thick head, good color, but otherwise average. Heavy malt flavor is hay, toasted, and mild coffee. moderate citrus hop flavor. Light yeast flavors remind of broth. Apple, butter and corn are other noted flavors. Small frothy mostly lasting head is off white, with excellent lacing, and a very clear, flat, medium orange body. Lightly sweet and bitter, with a hint of sourness. Finish is sweet and bitter, and of average duration. body is light in palate, a bit watery, flat, and lightly astringent.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

3737,"2007-11-12",3.2,"@NH Irish Redon tap-pours a thin retaining off white head and amber color.  Aroma is citrus hops-medium malt.  Taste is citrus hops, sweet medium malt/slight bitter at finish.  Mild carbonation.","Florida and, New Jersey, USA","jcwattsrugger"
3737,"2007-10-27",3.0,"Cask sample at the Princeton location: Pours reddish-amber with a dense off-white head that burns off to a thin layer. Minimal lacing. The aroma is subtle malt and hops. Medium, soft body with earthy malt and muted hops flavors. The finish is round and sweet with a short malty aftertaste. Not very impressive overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
3737,"2007-09-19",3.2,"on nitro @ New Hope.  Deep amber in color. Creamy lasting light tan head.  Aroma is a bit muted, but caramel and light notes of chocolate.  Taste is malty with caramel, with some caramelized dark crystal or something along those lines.  Creamy mouthfeel from the nitro, but as usual it hinders its flavor and aroma profile.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3737,"2006-03-13",3.2,"Hand pump in Princeton.  Poured red with a thick and foamy off white head.  Foam took a while to die down.  Aromas of grain, citrus and caramel.  Dry tase with caramel notes.  There was also a breadiness.  Weak and watery palate with some sweet malts.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"

3737,"2005-04-11",3.0,"Hand pump- Pours with a nice off white head.  Aroma threw me off a bit, some sulphur notes that I didnt enjoy, but past that had some nice flavors mingling.  Begins with a wet breadiness.  Medium mouthfeel, mild maltiness comes through initially, finishes a bit bitter.","Eastampton, New Jersey, USA","Cornboy"
3737,"2005-04-09",3.5,"04.09.05  Hand pump at Princeton location.  There was no description in the menu (as usual) or on the upstairs board.First of all, I was really hoping for the maibock today, or the IPX, but I was apparently in between the two and, at first, felt like I was getting stuck with this fill-in.  Copper pour with thick biege head.  Sheeting lace.  Aroma is earthy and peat soaked with morning bakery smells and ...somthing sort of lager-ish about it.  Flavor is very dry with big earth notes.  Coating body though that vanishes on the finish leaving a bitter ghost haunting my palate.  Lots of malts highlighted by dull white pepper.  Pleasant and mild, this one laughs at mass produced swill Irish ales as it truly asserts itself with peat and bitterness.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
