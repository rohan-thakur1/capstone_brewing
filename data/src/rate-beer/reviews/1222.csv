 Flavor is a beautiful rendition of the aroma. The bourbon and booze has mellowed with the nine months in barrels plus the two months in my cellar. Dont misunderstand, the booze is still here but really not bad for the 14%, love the warming down the belly after the sip. Very rich English Style Barely Wine as the base.

1222,"2014-06-16",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
This Barley Wine shares deep, enduring malt flavors which evoke Corinth raisins, honey and barley sugar, all kept in check by alcohol heat.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the pale amber.
-The rendering is super clean.
-Mouthfeel is creamy and warming, but not too heavy.
-Despite the relative intensity, the flavor profile remains somewhat delicate. There is no screaming in here.

1222,"2014-02-21",4.1,"Murky light amber pour. Short lived white head. Big sweet boozy aroma. Bourbon, vanilla, toffee, butterscotch, coconut. Coconut and peach are strong in the flavor. More toffee and butterscotch. Strawberry and plum. Orange. Hops are very hidden, but clearly contribute a big fruity complexity in the back. Bitterness is barely there, but obviously doing a big job of mellowing the aggressive sweetness of the malt. Sweet but in proper balance. Alcohol burn lingers on the gums, but not really present in the flavor. Chewy mouthfeel but lightly effervescent and creamy. I'm not a big bourbon barrel fan, but this one is done right. It contributes without overwhelming everything else. Great complexity and balance. Lacks some of the finesse of other Jack's Abby beers that sets them apart, but still exceptionally well done. I'd still really love to try this prior to the barrel treatment, but can't hold that against the beer too much.

1222,"2014-02-11",3.9,"The beer pours a deep, golden orange, like blonde syrup. It forms a small head of tight, white bubbles that are just barely off-white, and have little to no retention. As it sits in the glass, I start to detect amber highlights in the beers color. In body, the beer is clear and clean, as a lager should be, but with a nice darkness from the amount of malt found in this beer. The beer is translucent, but you can tell there is some viscosity to the liquid found within the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of boozy rum-soaked raisins, rum cake, a touch of plum, and smooth sherry. Hints of caramel and brown sugar tickle at the nose, and the oxidation of the beer briefly touches at wet cardboard, but not in a bad way. The boozy scent is surprisingly rum-like on my nose, especially given the fact that the barrels for this beer were third-use bourbon barrels. As the beer opens up, the sherry becomes more prominent and complex, swaying between candied sugars, maple syrup, and touches of raisin. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet with a touch of candy and a definite boozy heat that is not quite out of control, and is richly complex and balancing. Tannic bitters definitely touch the second half of the sip along with subtle herbal hop bitters, which do wonders keeping the beer just shy of cloying. In flavor, the beer is nicely complex. The beer opens with rich maple syrup, which travels into rum soaked raisins, slight plum, maybe even a touch of blackberry, and boozy caramel sugar. A touch of bourbon can be sensed on the middle of the palate, providing vanilla and rich oak flavors to the mix. The heat also gets a bit hot in the middle of the sip, giving a spicy flavor that varies with the sip. As the beer warms richer oak flavors come into play. The finish is smooth and syrupy with sherry flavors alongside maple syrup, vanilla, raisin, and hot booze. The finish is a bit boozy right now, and could stay a touch longer on the tongue. The aftertaste is rich with oak flavors tinged by caramel, sherry, and light booze. In the mouth, the beer feels heavy in body, with a chewy, syrupy mouthfeel and a very mild carbonation. The tongue is left slightly tingling from booze with a sheen of acid-canceling spittle on the tongue and a faint stickiness in the mouth. Overall, this is a tremendous candidate for cellaring for a year or two. The flavors are rich and complex, but the booze is just a touch too hot at the moment. Honestly, I would only cellar this for a year and then pop it, as longer than that may add too much oxidation and might lose some of the wonderful complexity already present in the beer. I love the rich rum, oak, and malt flavors, and I feel that the lager yeast allows for more of these flavors to come through, which I like. It is fairly similar to a barrel-aged barleywine, but the mouthfeel and appearance are really where it varies wildly. This is a great beer. If you can get to the brewery, you should buy two and age one.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

The spent Framinghammer barrels plays a minor role by providing some toffee and roasted malts. Almost barleywine/old ale like. A bit cloying and overly sweet but its one delicious sipper.
