Smooth with rice, alcohol, grass, mildly bitter nuts, and a light fruitiness, perhaps melon.  Dry finish, which one might expect from the name.  Very drinkable.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Wine & Spirits, Downers Grove, IL<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
277,"2005-10-04",3.1,"Perfectly clear with oily motion when poured.  No aroma.  Rice and alcohol (mildly) in the flavor with a smooth easy-going palate.  Not much effort goes into knocking a few of these back pretty quickly.  Very dry finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
277,"2005-07-01",2.7,"Clear watery color with no legs. Nose of watery koji and dry, brash alcohol notes. Strong. Feels like you should be heating this one. Polystyrene & rubber cement notes along with the typical buttery coconut.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
277,"2005-06-26",3.4,"2004 bottle from the Belfast Organic Co-op in Maine.  Ah, its nice to finally have the chance to sit down and rate a beer (sake in this case) in front of the computer.  Its been a long time.Aroma of crystal clear spring water, light, bleached white rice.  Faint touches of coconut and rice meal.  Hints of alcohol are very faint.  Not tremendously aromatic, or at least, I cant find much.  Flavor, however, is quite interesting.  Coconuts, rice pudding/boiled white rice.  Rice milk beverage and hints of vanilla.  Palate is voloptuous and silky at the same time, with a full, creamy and light-coconut milk like texture.  Finishes rather dry, and with some odd rice husk flavors that are not quite as good as the flavor through the body.  Vanilla beans and some alcohol linger on, with the liquid sitting thickly on the tongue.  A very interesting sake.  Appearance is still and clear.  Good amount of legs coat the rim of the glass, lasting and quite 3-dimensional.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
277,"2004-09-30",3.2,"Perfectly clear and still - not even a hint of color.  While this did have a very very dry finish, the actual palate seemed smooth and milky, almost thick.  I tasted a lot of nuts in this - almonds maybe - and very little fruit and flowers.  Alcohol was apparent esp. after the finish.  Nice little bottle.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
277,"2004-05-22",3.1,"I bought this small bottle of sake because of its size.  Small.  It poured no head to speak of, only a few clear bubbles that disappeared as fast as they formed.  The body is clear like water.  The aroma can be smelled from a distance with mild alcohol and dry sake scents.  The mouth feel was very dry with a vinous alcohol sake finish that warms up with time.  The flavor is vinous and EverClear like alcohol.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
277,"2004-05-13",3.3,"My first Sake! Well, the first Ive rated. Ive had it before, of course - I aint no rube. Anyway - Served Chilled. Clear, grainy, white wine arome. Tart, mildly dirtic flavor, with alcohol apparent in the finish.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
277,"2003-12-22",3.9,"very mild aroma, nice dry flavor but almost over powered by the alcohol, not too much to say about sake i guess... i mean its clear, mildly fragrant and mildly flavored.... =^T hm","Torrance, California, USA","lunaticharness"
