Has aromas of ripe orange fruits, fresh herbs, a tad of grass and lots of rustic caramel malts. 

Drinks very soft, with a soothing, well nuanced carbonation, while the beer showcases a convincing balance between being malty sweet and herbal dry.

Tastes of toasted nuts and forest earth, together with whole grain bread and an early hop dryness, which not only consists of a herbal quality but also includes a ripe orange fruit note. Turns even breadier then, with the malts adding a sweet quality to the taste, which vanishes during the finish, in which the beer regains its herbal hoppiness, exhibiting a long lasting dryness, still coated by the malts.

Utmost flavorful and intense, well build with even more hop depth than many batches of the regular Sticke. Its carbonation though is almost a little too low and I am not a big fan of the enhanced malt sweetness, which is unusual for Uerige.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1416,"2016-02-25",3.8,"(swing top bottle, 33cl) Hazy, dark brown colour with a beige and firm medium-sized foamy head. Fresh, grassy and resiny hoppy aroma with subtle citric notes, backed by mildly toasted malt and caramel. Bitter-sweet flavour, medium bodied with a well-matured carbonation. Initially malty with caramel, delicately syrupy taste; drying grassy, herbal and mildly resiny hops tuning in quite quickly, accompanied by delicately fruity accents towards the lasting bitter-sweet finish, hints of raspberries retronasal. Balanced and more-ish Sticke. 25.II.16","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
1416,"2016-02-22",3.7,"láhev, čerstvě z balíku od pana doktora - díky moc! Slightly hazy dark chestnut-brown colour with a mid-sized off-white head. Spicy-hoppy nose. Medium- to full-bodied, robust malty base with some dark malts and a shy bitter touch, very faint coffee-like hints. Slightly fruity and very, very spicy. Pleasantly hopped, resiny, slightly grassy with earthy notes. Smooth and velvety on the palate - a very nice little beer.","Down South, GERMANY","Quack-Duck"

1416,"2016-02-19",4.6,"Deep sweet wet dough aroma sounded by malt roast, hints of anis licorice, caramel prunes and chocolate. With faint hints of barrel (rum).
Medium to heavy mouthfeel. well carbonated but dissipates within the malt. Huge explosions of resin, pine, chocolate,licorice, caramelized bread, pepper, hints of orange. 
Starts off medium to heavy in the mouth but as it goes down your throat it dissipates and dries out leaving a brilliant finish with a slight wanted bitterness that balances out the entire experience. I absolutely love it.","Freiburg, GERMANY","Oldmanriver"
1416,"2016-02-18",3.8,"33cl bbJul16 from Bierhandlung, merci Martin. - Unctuous Pfirsich caramel pour. Sweet and near-sour aroma, candied lemon and tea leaf like granulated ice tea. Couples the confident whole-cone, near-English orange peel bitterness to heavy caramels with a ""sharp"" edge. Somehow I imagine part of the bitterness coming from the ""Uerige Hefe"". Pushes the boundaries of Alt towards the malt body of a Double IPA, without the unnecessary boost. Can Kehrwieder/Wesseloh become the Mikkeller of German traditional brewart? Well-done experiment.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

1416,"2016-02-12",3.7,"Never been a huge fan of the bittersweet Sticke if some regular-strength fresh Alt is handy, but here the sticky-minty-herbal hop aroma and flavor help to make that slog worthwhile, like how a good audiobook turns a routine drive into something that flies by, and you arrive and wonder why its over so quickly. Fun beer. I suspect it has staying power (annually).","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
1416,"2016-02-11",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2017 Bottle and tap. Nice brown-amber color with big tan head. Aroma is caramel, citrusy and grassy hops, some plums shine through. Taste is a confusing mix of sticky sweet toffee and grassy hops, towards the end, a clear grassy hop punch. Aftertaste is hoppy as well. Full-bodied. The mixture is actually very special, there?s more to it than what you imagine when you hear ""dryhopped Sticke"", but it?s hard to describe. This is a good beer.Tap of the second batch, had in February 2017. Still a great beer. Uli ""h.ertie"" told me this is like old Orval, which I dont really agree, but it definitely is good.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
