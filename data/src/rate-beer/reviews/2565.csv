2565,"2017-06-07",3.9,"LIBF2017. Piwo ma kolor pomarańczowy z minimalną, bialą pianą, która w średnim tempie redukuje się do sporej zpienionej plamy.
Aromat ziolowy, kwiatowy z nutą owoców w tle.
Smak jest dokładną kopią aromatu. Jest tak jak wcześniej ziołowość, nuty kwiatowe i delikatne akcenty owocowe, którym towarzyszy dość spora kwaśność.
Nasycenie średnie, pasuje.","POLAND","PlutonowyMan"

2565,"2016-12-03",4.3,"330 ml bottle via trade. Thanks, Dylan! Pours a cloudy kinda dim orange with a small white head that settles into a ring and a few spots of film. The aroma bursts with ginger, lemon juice, wildflowers, soda, orange zest, lime, melon rind, grass, and sawdust. The flavor is citrusy and acidic, with great ginger spice, just the right amount. Lemon-lime, wildflowers, tea. More acidity than the aroma lets on, just nice and tart and herbal and fresh. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation. Absolutely delightful. This was eye-opening. Best Scratch beer Ive had to date, and I will make it a point to get future bottled releases.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

2565,"2016-10-23",3.9,"bottle from Mr. Bs. Tonic is a hazy gold with a very small head. The aroma is tart and herbal with heavy ginger. Notes of earth and bitters come through. The flavor is well balanced with distinct ginger and lemongrass notes. Tonic is a great name for this beer because thats definitely what it tastes like. The palate is dry and spritzy. I dont miss the hops at all. Plenty of earthy bitterness is present with the ginger right up front. What a crazy beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
