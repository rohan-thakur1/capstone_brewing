4270,"2017-04-16",3.9,"Unpretentious looking 12 oz. bottle pours a clear golden/yellow color with small tight white head and a little lacing. Aroma is full of hay, barley malt and cereal. Taste is slightly sweet with hops coming out in the finish to leave a bitter aftertaste. Body is light but not watery, with a crisp mouthfeel and without too much carbonation. This is easily drinkable and refreshing. I savored the first one and found it to be one of the most flavorful lagers Ive ever tried. If I had blind tested it, I would have guessed it was brewed in Germany. It is also as humble and understated as the typical Minnesotan, who would rate it ""not too bad"". Ill be sure to bring home more of these on my next trip to Mankato.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"

4270,"2016-07-12",4.0,"A rare beer that tastes like you remember your first surreptitiously acquired lager from decades ago. Aroma released from a stylish pour to three fingers of foam is part corner bakery, part grassy field after the thresher has gone through. Taste has a sweet start and mildly bitter and dry finish. Will definitely bring home more on next trip west.",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"
