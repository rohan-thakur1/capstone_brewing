3743,"2017-06-18",3.8,"Brewed in 2013 edition, bottle wrapped in decorative paper. Beer from The Cave, Glasgow. Served in 14°C, Tulip Glass. Old beers after long maturation can be unpredictable, and this for sure was. Grenade! Beer explodes while opening, almost whole carbonation disappears in few seconds along with cascades of foam. Colour is two dimensional, light clear brown at the top, dark hazy brown at the bottom. A lot of big pieces of yeasts floating in the glass. Aroma is wine like, old cherries confiture, overripe fruits, hint of plum and roasted malt. Taste is also similar to aged dry wine, rich and very smooth alcohol, plums, overripe bananas, apples, cloves, roasted note. Anyway it was for sure interesting experience to try 4 years old Weizen Bock.","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","Navers"

Finally reviewing from 50cl bottle in weisse glass. Pours a moderate to abundant creamy off-white head, nice orange/ruby to dark mahogany brown colour, haziness depending on how much sediment you pour. Smells deep and very fruity, cherries, berries, sweet bread / xmas loaf, with typical but refined weissbier aromas like clove, ripe banana, esters. Taste follows the path of the aroma, with raisins, berries and cherries again, dried fruits, caramel, blended all together in a great crystal malt background, wheat hints; really spot on medium plus sweetness, which leaves space to a light bitter finish; fruity and light tartness coming through. Heavy and full bodied, creamy and silky, alcohol is well blended. Very complex, juicy and tasty. Takes all the best from the more standard blond weiss, paring it with nice darker malts and fruits, light roasted elements.

3743,"2017-02-11",4.6,"Une bière dune exceptionnelle complexité. Cette Aventinus est dune richesse gustative incroyable à la fois sur les épices et le fruit qui ne peut laisser indifférent. Elle en est surement une grande Weizen Bock (ma connaissance du genre étant encore limitée), et elle en serait une grande bière si lalcool y était brin mieux intégré et le final plus travaillé. En verre, elle est de couleur chêne foncé (EBC de 48 environ) surmontée dune mousse beige, stable à un centimètre dépaisseur. Le nez est une pure splendeur, dune richesse et dune complexité hors du commun qui plus est, évolutive. Les arômes de caramel et de céréales se mélangent à des notes épicées (réglisse, pointe de girofle) et de fruits (fraise, banane, moût de raisin). Plusieurs minutes sont nécessaires pour lappréhender entièrement. Lattaque,suave porte déjà des arômes épicés (notamment de la cannelle) auxquels viennent sajouter des notes de fraise et de caramel. La deuxième bouche se porte sur les fruits jaunes mûrs avec une arrière bouche très riche sur la banane, le moût de raisin et les épices. Une très belle composition. La présence en bouche est digne des très grandes bières. lamertume, peu intense (IBU de 16 avec une utilisation dHallertauer Herkules connu pour ses arômes épicés) est cependant bien intégrée et relève convenablement les arômes. Lalcool (8,2 % Abv) plus présent en troisième bouche nest malheureusement pas tout à fait bien intégré. Les arômes de réglisse et de pruneaux sont néanmoins agréables. La succession darômes, très différents, est quant à elle bien pensée. Lensemble glisse remarquablement bien dans une belle homogénéité. Le final marquera la deuxième petite fausse note. Celle-ci, dune longueur acceptable (mais qui aurait tout de même gagnée à être un peu plus longue) ne présente rien de remarquable et se positionne principalement.sur le malt Deux petits bémols qui ne permettent pas de faire naître démotions particulières et qui laisse des regrets tant le nez était prometteur.

Ceci venant de quelquun qui naime pas les bières de blés est assez surprenant, mais cest justement cela qui fait tout son attrait: elle se donne a tout le monde la coquine! Son blé malté lui conférant un côté caramélisé si doux et réconfortant, elle fond littéralement dans la bouche et malgré sa forte teneur en alcool sa douceur et rondeur la rend accessible a tous. Il me semble quil y a quelques années elle avait un gout de cacao plus prononcé mais cela nenlève rien a sa perfection, seulement elle peut changer de tempérament avec lâge. Elle est douce au palais malgré une carbonisation qui persiste longtemps. Des saveurs de poire, banane, carvi, sucre brun, caramel et un petit côté terreux la rendent intrigante a souhait, mais ne traumatisera aucun non-initié par son audace tout en retenu. De même, elle est démocratiquement accessible a tous avec son petit prix qui devrait faire sorte dexemple a plusieurs microbrasseurs cherchant a chatouillé le marché de luxe ou la bière nas vraiment pas sa place.","Saint-Alban, Quebec, CANADA","BrunTremens"

 Piana:  Umiarkowanie trwała, lekka, średnio wysoka. Pianę formują średnie i drobne żółte oczka, które szybko pękają.
Wysokie wysycenie niszczy niemiłosiernie pianę.
Pod koniec degustacji jest jej niewiele powyżej 2 milimetrów.
Krążki na ściankach tylko gdzie niegdzie. 
 Zapach: Zapach, który unosi się nad butelką jest średnio trwały. Po odkapslowaniu dochodzi do nosa aromat wyraźnie estrowy (ciemne owoce). Dalej pojawia się odrobina fenoli (delikatny goździk).
Kolejno do bukietu zapachowego dołączają chleb pszenny i trochę tostów.
Lekki banan też się gdzieś tutaj zaplątał.
W aromacie alkohol jest zupełnie niewyczuwalny. 
 Smak:  Smak wyraźnie melanoidowy (tosty, skórka od chleba), potem odrobina ciemnych owoców (rodzynki), na sam koniec przyprawowe fenole (goździk).
Posmak pszenicy bardzo widoczny.
Piwo jest sycące, zapychające. Po jednej butelce 0,5l czuje się jakbym zjadł syty obiad. 
Goryczka niewielka, przyprawowo-owocowy finisz. 
Procenty zamiecione pod dywan.
Piwo mocne i konkretne, pytanie tylko czy smaczne? 
 Wysycenie : Wysokie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Aventinus jest to najstarszy na świecie fermentowany górną fermentacją pszeniczny Doppelbock.
Obecny na rynku już od 1907 roku!

Piwo jest konkretne w smaku, mocne i cholernie treściwe.
Jest to jedno z najmocniejszych piw pszenicznych jakie miałem okazję degustować.
Dominują tutaj akcenty estrów owocowych (rodzynki), mnóstwo melanoidyn (przypieczona skórka chlebowa, tosty), nuty pszenicy, a na dopełnienie całości dochodzi do tego lekki fenolowy finisz.
Alkohol został dobrze ukryty.
Całościowo piwo niezłe, aczkolwiek oczekiwania miałem znacznie...znacznie wyższe i trochę się zawiodłem.

Aroma has notes of banana, raisins and bubblegum. Oily texture, medium body, soft carobonation and a lingering sweet finish that has only a lightly boozy touch.

3743,"2015-09-06",4.1,"500ml bottle bought at Berliner German Bar & Restaurant in Langham Place, Mongkok.
Looks: Translucent dark mahogany colour with a thick layer of dark brown yeast sediments; Two finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasted for 2 minutes; Small sticky lacing and quite active carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragment malt, with strong wheat and tartness, banana, vanilla, alcohol, strong caramel, toffee, sugar, cloves, strong spices, strong yeast, light lemon and grass.

Taste: Medium to strong sweet dark malt, with moderate roastyness, nuts, fairly strong wheaty tartness, strong plums, raisins, banana, strong caramel, fairly strong alcohol, very strong molasses, strong wood, light earth, cloves, strong spices, strong yeast, lemon, medium bitter hops and grass. What a bliss!

Body: Mid to light body. Thin but slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Complexity ahoy! The dark malty body stands up well in the presence of equally strong wheatyness. Very good roasty nutty woody characters. Boozy plums and dark fruits upstage the banana. Strong caramel and right-on strong sweetness. Spicy clove-y with fairly strong lemony hops to round. Way to go!

Hoppiness: Wood, strong spices, light lemon and grass in nose, and much stronger in taste. Bitterness is fairly notable for an abrupt, moderate astringent sweet finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Roasty, fruity and slightly boozy to mouth.

Comments: This is a very well-made and complex Weizenbock - malt and wheat are well presented, fruity esters are impressive, booze is strong but undisturbing, and woody, spicy lemony hops in abundance. This is the yardstick of the style, and I am in for a treat!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

3743,"2015-06-09",3.8,"12.9 oz. bottle vertically poured to a logoed, proprietary glass at Lunar Brewing Co., producing a thick & frothy, light tan layer that lasted persistently on top of the cloudy, amber highlighted, brown colored liquid, leaving ribbons & patches of clingy lacing. The nose was tart & juicy, kind of prune juice-like, with additional esters as pit fruit skin, and spice as subtle clove. Medium bodied, with only average carbonation, partly due to the pour, and some creaminess to the mouthfeel, the taste was more as a blend of dried fruit and some dark varieties, with complementary alcohol included. Probably a bit of age on this bottle, although I didnt receive Chucks discount, but still damn smooth and tasty as the benchmark for the style.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

Pours out with a fine thick head. Deep caramel coloring. Nice thick malty nose. First mouth feel is smooth and mellow. Not much in the way of hops with the nice warm and mellow embrace of toasted barley and malt dominating the entire experience. Its like falling into the arms of an old lover, its comfortable, sensual and oh so pleasurable to be home.

The 8.2 % ABV guarantees that warm ""just loved"" feel. Very nice indeed.

3743,"2015-05-12",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2015 I must say this beer is actually two beers; so Ill write two tastings: In the first one we have a fresh one, brewed the same year it is being sipped. The tasting notes would be like this: ""Pours hazy brown, tan head. Intense aroma of banana. Thats all. Fizzy, sweetish, full-bodied. No bitterness. Long finish."" So, a nice beer indeed, but rather monotonous. Now, for the second tasting, were having a beer brewed three years prior to the moment of drinking (in this particular case brewed in 2012). It would yield something similar to this: "" Pours dark cherry red with tan head. Aroma is complex and vinous: lots of blackcurrant, blackberry, bilberry and cherry, along smoky and liquor scents. In the mouth it feels soft, dense, mouth-covering. Good sour notes and restrained bitterness. Great."" Now its up to you to decide wether to drink it young or aged. In my particular case it has gone from 3.6 up to perfection, so the choice is clear.","Madrid, SPAIN","huineman"

Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing were both decent enough. I like the aroma, the brew smells like cloves, vanilla, plums, raisins, and some dark bread. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some caramel, sherry and bubblegum.

3743,"2014-10-30",4.8,"1 pint bottle, poured into a bell glass at approximately 45 degrees F.

A: Pours the color of weak coffee or strong tea, pooling into the glass as a lovely shade of burnished copper, cloudy and murky with a red-copper sheen where light shines through along the sides of the glass. The head is a pale, faint tan, and lingers a while as a cap which leaves some sheet lacing that slowly slips back down to the surface.

S: Toffee-sprinkled wheat bread dipped in caramel, slathered in some banana and grape preserves.

T: A malt explosion, all toffee-caramel bread. Hints of banana and cloves swim through the sweetness, alongside some faint grape-raisin-black cherry echoes. Theres a touch of herbaceous bitterness to the finish, and oddly, I get more alcohol heat from the Aventinus than the Aventinus Eisbock.

M: A tad on the thin side, towards watery, but still somewhat sticky, with lively carbonation.

Also hints of fruits and sugar, the beer is moderate sweet. This moderate sweetness is however a bit too dominant, the taste could have been deeper, more compelling. Still nice beer.

3743,"2014-10-14",4.3,"0.5l bottle poured in a my Weihenstephaner Weizen glass.
Delicious beer. Simple like that. The delicacy of a Weissbier, the power of a good bock with a fruity and spicy bouquet. 
A: Cloudy brown color with a creamy and persistent head. High carbonation. Dirty as a typical Weissbier (looks like thin wheat in the bottom of the bottle) 
S: Pure pleasure. Very fruity and spicy. German yeasts and caramel malts are relevant. Less banana flavors than a traditional Weiss.
T: Good as expected. German yeasts and malt are again, relevant. Toffee and very light liquor upfront taste. Not bitter at all (only perfume hops could be felt). Balanced sweet.
M: Heavy and creamy body. Good carbonation, balanced sweet in the beginning and very low bitterness in the end. 
D: High. Alcohol is almost imperceptible despite the 8.2 ABV. High quality German beer.

3743,"2014-08-09",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 10-11-12- 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer was served as a hazy medium brown color with a thin off white head. The head had a moderate persistence fading to leave a nice level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of a brown bread smell with tons of darker fruit notes. For the fruit, raisin, plum, and a lighter cherry flavor are all there. With these aromas is a good hint of booze and a light amount of yeast and banana.

 Taste  The taste begins heaviest of the darker fruit flavors of raisin and plum with a more subdued brown bread taste mixed within. As the taste advances some light banana flavors as well as a wheat and yeasty flavor coming to the tongue. Toward the end, a pleasant warming alcohol flavor comes to the tongue, leaving a nice sweet warming taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and fuller side with a lighter carbonation level. The overall mouthfeel very nicely compliments all the dark fruit and yeasty and light boozy flavors very well.

 Overall  This is one tasty and very drinkable brew. It is renowned for a reason. Very well done. Tons of great flavor and an overall joy to drink.","","Darkmagus82"

3743,"2014-08-04",4.5,"Smoked/baked fruit, particularly apples and bananas, which settles into an aftertaste of cheese--brie?--and, in the back of the mouth, oceansmell, or perhaps saltwater taffy or chicken noodle soup (with, perhaps, a tiny bit of coffee with milk), along with a sort of woodsy taste and breakfast-cereal feel. It has an aroma I cant quite put my finger on, but which reminded me very strongly of something. Old furniture or books? Caramel? No idea. The beer was poured into a Weizen glass from a bottle brought over from Munich.

Just off the top of my head, I might pair it with spaghetti and meatballs, venison, pork, caramel apples, or perhaps turkey, but all of those are just a guess. I would also pair it with a hard day of lumberjacking or a state fair. It would also go well with the ""toot sweet"" scene, along with others, from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I havent seen it in awhile, but The Glass Bottom Boat would maybe do in a pinch. Would do well drunk in a (Scandanavian) library, although almost everything is better with libraries.","","Murano"

3743,"2014-06-12",3.6,"Color is different, like a molasses or some sort of pale coffee. Color almost looks like the color of the bottle. Pretty decent head. Aroma is dark fruit, some raisin, cherries, with those typical wheat beer flavors (bananas, cloves). Balances the wheat beer flavors well with the Doppebock style, so its malty and has lots of spices in it, while having a more subdued wheat flavor. Light carbonation. Pretty cool, this. Its different for me.","New York, USA","SG111"
3743,"2014-06-11",3.8,"Bottled August 19, 2013.
Appearance: Velvety hazy chestnut-reddish hued body with a towering creamy/foamy tan head.
Aroma: The aroma is a bit faint but I get raisin bread notes along with a dash of clove, banana and bubblegum.
Taste: Bready malts with underlying raisins sets the pace. Upon a second sip I get banana and bubblegum underlying the bready malts as well. Sort of a cinnamon spice on the finish, phenols are restrained for sure. Nicely balanced and drinkable.
Palate: Darn near flat with a mildly thick body.
Overall: I prefer Vitus, but this is a damn fine beer as well. Nicely balanced with a lot of nuances and available at a great price. That sounds like a winner to me. 
Cellar Review
Brewed in 2007, part of the vintage releases Schneider does.
Appearance: Read my notes on the fresher Aventinus.
Aroma: Aroma is pungent with cherry and fig, cherry is prominent with sweet brown sugar and subtle banana. Definitely weaker than the aroma indicates.
Palate: Same as fresh.
Overall: Definitely something to be experienced next to the fresh one. I would buy this again.

3743,"2014-06-09",3.9,"Pours a dirty-looking, cloudy, opaque, medium brown body with a huge, beige, decent-sized head that reduces to a fully lasting layer. The aroma is very strong, sweet and complex. Lots of overripe banana, yeast, spices and interesting notes of dark dried fruits. The flavour is even more complex, again overripe banana in front together with sweet caramel, yeast, raisins and vinous alcohol, in the back I get christmassy spices in the form of anise and clove, and finally there are hints of maple syrup. I actually think that this is one of the most complex beer Ive ever had! The taste is moderate sweet, but the beer still feels pretty dry, probably due to all the suspended yeast. The long-lasting and pleasantly alcoholic finish has a moderate to light bitterness. Mid to full bodied, lively carbonation. A magnificent brew! It feels a bit wrong to give an overall score of only 3.9 to such a fabulous beer, but thats what happens when it looks like muddy water.

3743,"2014-06-03",3.2,"If I'm reading the date on the bottle right it is November of 2013.

Looks like a muddy swamp, yet I progressed nonetheless. Very sweet and chewy on the tounge.

3743,"2014-06-03",4.0,"Rating #2100. Nov, 13. A 0.5 l bottle from Vrutak store, Zagreb. It poured very dark brown body with medium sized head, which translates to small for Weizen. Beautiful style related stuff in aroma, along with some other fruits and only a touch of toasted malt. Flavor was lightly sweet, biscuit malty, yeasty, with a palette of fruits extending over typical German wheat characteristics. Apple, toffee and caramel are the most different ones. Also very nicely peppery, while cloves are felt to much lesser extent. I didnt get smoked ham that my gf did, although I wanted to.

T: This beer is very sweet. The noble hops are fighting a losing battle here. The finish struggles towards dryness, thankfully, otherwise this beer would be too sweet except for sipping or drinking with food. M: The body is in line with the flavor: medium to heavy. Texture is creamy and lingers just a little on the palate. Carbonation is adequate for the heavy sweetness. D: This beer was good, and I think it probably has come to define the style. Therefore, it would be hard to rate it low. It is not really my favorite style due to the intense sweetness, but it does manage to bring together two very different styles: hefeweizen and doppelbock.

Biscuit malt base to the aroma, with notes of salted caramel, dark fruits, banana, smoked bacon, and a fair bit of alcohol. Fair bit of yeast in the taste with the biscuit and bready malts, as well as the salted caramel, dark fruits notes from before, now alongside some more spices and a little bit of liquorice.

Slick, oily and pleasantly smooth mouthfeel. Aftertaste is sweet with toffee and bready malts, convert to a warming feeling in the stomach.

Aroma is very malty with some light banana and clove character. Dark, toasted bread, caramel, toffee and a bit of treacle. Moderate raisin and prune notes. No hop character. 
Puts a slightly murky, brown to dark brown with some burnt amber hues and a fairly thick, moderately sized tan head. Head has slightly above average retention. Medium light leaving and medium sized legs. 
Flavor has a moderately sweet malt character with quite a bit of toasted bread, caramel and toffee with faint chocolate and roast. Moderate raisin character with lighter fig and prune. Light banana and medium light clove notes. Light bitterness with no hop flavor. Hint of alcohol spice. As the beer warms, I pick up more yeast character and fruit notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall the beer has a nice malt character well balanced with quite a bit of yeast notes. A rather enjoyable beer, but the yeast character, while to style, really isnt my favorite.

3743,"2014-01-16",4.0,"500ml bottle to Schneider Weizen glass, pour is a murky brown with an off white head that leaves a little top. Aroma is strong dart fruit, well roasted malts.....huge plum and raisin notes, some banana, clove.....herby/medicinal stuff. Taste is quite sweet but not overpowering. Squares off with a bit of roasted bitterness but not much in the hop department. Its a lot like combining a light coffee with notes of licorice, raisin and slight dark fruits. Very slight sour notes as well. Palate is medium bodied which comes to me as quite a surprise given the aroma seemed to be fairly heavy and how strong it is in the grain department. The beer is deceptively light considering the strength and lack of sugar addition though the carbonation is fairly generous which helps. 

Overall this is a solid beer though a bit heavy on the banana notes. I feel like this is more a fine liqeur meant to be savored, but its quite good so I dont expect this glass to last me long. Cheers!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","RD400F"

A - pours a nice dark brown colour which passes very little light. very thick, very foamy, three fingers worth of head that dissipates at an average speed.

S - banana and spices are present off the top. there a hint of clove and dark fruits in there. smell is the only let down here for me. 

T - this beer is very nice and has a great number of tastes coming through (much more than i expected from the smell). its surprisingly refreshing off the bat (at least for me) for a darker beer and there is very little if any of the 8.2% of alcohol coming through. you can taste the typical clove and banana which is why i love these beers so much, along with a nice caramel malty flavour as it sits in your mouth. you can defintiely taste some of the dark fruit that i could smell after the pour. i wouldnt call this a summer beer but im definitely enjoying it on a nice summer day with a baguette. more refreshing than your average dark beer.

M - a very creamy taste which goes down extra smooth. medium carbonation which seems a perfect balance to the taste of this bad boy. not too much of a lingering aftertaste but my mouth is defintiely wanting more after each sip.

O - i love wheat beers! im usually a bigger fan of the typical hefeweizen, but i do like to try some of the darker wheat beers. after weihenstephaner dunkel, this is the best dark wheat beer ive ever tried. i could enjoy this beer all year round and i can see it pairing great with a steak on the grill. it was hard to keep this one in my glass and as i was so pleasantly surprised by it, I am planning a trip back to the LCBO to buy another few bottles for the weekend. If you like wheat beers or dark beers or any kind of beer of quality...get this beer.

A: pours a dark brown ale with limited clarity and a small hint of orange on the light source. Two fingers of peanut head falls slowly to a broken quilt of the same. Insane lacing.

It pours a murky brown colour with a frothy tan coloured head, which starts big and soon diminishes. The smell is fine though nothing too exciting, revleaing a kind of sweetish wheat beer scent. The taste for me was of dried bananas and plums initially, followed by other dried sweet fruits. Behind that has the wheat beer taste along with a bit of yeast (to provide the much needed bitterness). It is rather frothy and creamy in the mouth with a noticable but mild level of carbonation.
To sum it up then, this was a nice beer although perhaps a little sweet for my liking. At times it reminded me of a strong Belgium ale but without the complexity. I would be happy to drink this again but I cant see myself being in a hurry to purchase any more.","Cornwall, ENGLAND","beeebon"

Develops some delicate dry finish with yeast and fruits dominating till the aftertaste. After couple of sips it warms with the booze. The aftertaste reveals spices and earthy notes on the tongue.

3743,"2013-09-22",3.9,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a wheat beer glass. It was bottled on May 8, 2013 and cost $4.99 ($0.30 per ounce).

Appearance: An opaque shade of brown proper. Pours to a large, eggshell, frothy head which doesnt completely dissipate, but doesnt leave much lacing.

Smell: Though it has the traditional banana and clove aroma, its more of a spicier variety - like that of a Belgian Trappist ale. Some alcohol is noticeable, too.

Taste: I havent had a German weizenbock in a long time. In fact, the last brews of the style I had were the collaborations between Schneider and Brooklyn Brewery. Those were pretty special beers, but what about a standard, perennial German weizenbock? After all these years, I think Schneider Aventinus (Tap 6) is my first foray into the style, so Im definitely kicking myself for having waited so long.

While Schneider Aventinus definitely has a lot of similarities to a traditional hefeweizen, its not simply a hefeweizen plus more. This drinks like the bigger, stronger beer it is. It starts out sweet with a flavor akin to cinnamon bread, with a prominent wheaty character as well. Its much different than the taste of a doppelbock. Only a hint of bitterness at the crest of swig, followed quickly by a strong combination of alcohol and spice. What traditional hefeweizen is to banana and clove juice, weizenbock is to banana and clove liqueur. Spicy, zesty, almost Trappist-like with the amount of energy here. Additional cinnamon sweetness on the finish combined with light alcohol warmth and dryness in the aftertaste. 

Drinkability: While its pretty obvious that Schneider Aventinus is a big beer, its not a challenge to drink. The mouthfeel is soft and velvety, so its quite comfortable in the mouth and super smooth going down. While there is some spicy character, its not too intense. At 8.2% ABV, its not surprising that the alcohol is present, but at least it complements the palette so as not to be distracting.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

There is some banana/bubblegum sweetness that mixes really well with the spiciness. There is also a slight hint of vanilla on the backend. I have never had a beer that prominently features the warming sensation of alcohol but manages to not have it overtake the other flavors.

3743,"2013-06-14",3.7,"Bottle found in Yellowknife; whatzit2ya?!? As an aside - I cant believe how warm it is here. Like, its freaking warm! The sun has been searing through these little clouds and its totally not even close to setting at half past nine. But sadly its kinda raining, but the sun is still, like, out there, like Freddy Mercury! So anyways this thing pours sooper sweet with a huge head that actually stays around long enough for some beer rater to blab about where they are; the body is a nice foggy brown-gold, and if the head had stayed around a few more minutes it wouldve been perfect. The aroma is all coriander and orange, orange rind even, possibly even some shoe leather notes in there - high quality layering gives this one top marks. So, why cant some damned Vancouver brews do this? How do frikkin Germans from a million miles away manage to bottle this stuff? Food for the rain-soaked types, I tellz ya. The flavour is a soft mix of coriander and smoked barley; a bit of an odd mix, but its balanced well, and is a drinkable brew. And indeed caveat emptor: I just read that this thing is 8.2%, and its very rare to taste a beer with such high ABV that does not end up like watered down gasoline.

Nice wheat dark bock with good hopping too, bitter is above medium but not out of balance, thick texture. Pours with white to beige small top, color is muddy brown.

The inferior, watered down crap they peddle in the mainstream. But you need to dig deeper, find the underground, search it out. You need a guide. My guide was called The Bish. There may have been stormy clouds overhead, I dont recall. I know there was a blockage that needed fixing, and bets were taken. The stakes were high. The winner got to sample the German. We waited nervously for news. I was probably hanging with the Dutch or the slutty Belgian, again, the details are hazy. Then came the call. The news was good. Fast forward several days and I found myself in a dingy office with The Bish. The underground was beckoning, a shady cartel going by the name of Cherry Reds may have been mentioned. The German was delivered. I rushed her home and suckled on her nipple. The hit was a game changer, life never to be the same again. Ive since found myself sweating over when and where the next hit is coming from. Poring over obscure names, words I dont understand, places I didnt know existed. All in the search of a kick, started by the German. Im being nostalgic tonight, thinking back over those 60 odd days. Ive had some fun but I know Ive only just begun my descent into the darkness.

After much agitation, I was able to get a one-finger offwhite color head with poor retention and lacing.

S: Plenty of banana, cloves, and bubblegum with an additional twist of caramel/toffee and some dark fruit. Unique, to say the least.

T: Aside from the typical weizen-esque ester flavors (banana, clove, green apple), this blends in a darker malt note, giving it a more savory feel and taste over a hefe or even a dunkel. The finish is crisp and very fruity, without being exceedingly sweet or tart. Decent complexity and balance, with excellent drinkability and no palpable alcohol taste.

M: Very well carbonated. The yeast gives the body some heft but never weighs the tongue down with excessive astringency, which is exactly what this kind of beer should do. Slight finishing dryness.

Smells of banana, clove, and bubblegum. Wonderful yeasty character. Little bit of grass in there as well and maybe just a faint hint of alcohol.

Taste begins with strong clove and banana changing to some dark fruit; plums and a pretty strong cherry flavor. A little bit of pipe tobacco comes towards the end finishing up with a passing taste of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little sticky at the end.

3743,"2012-03-01",3.4,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/3/2011. ""Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a pint glass.

Aventinus comes out of a classic German bottle. The pour is a plum / brown color, with resplendent carbonation rising, presumably throughout the glass, but only visible right at the edges. These bubbles nobly rejuvenate the eggshell foam cap. Originally enormous, the head becomes manageable after a few minutes, and a sheet of lace is left down the side of the glass.

The smell is toffee, brown sugar, raisins, apple cider, and a bit of vinegar. 

I get some more spice elements in the flavor as this warms, which helps it out. It starts with a brown sugar sweetness, bringing some raisins with it. A spice variety comes up next, with the cloves coming through more as it warms. It turns almost cidery toward the end, with fermented apple dominating. The finish is spiced apple, a touch of vinegar, and a dash of brown sugar.

Crisp, tingly carbonation is obvious. It gets creamier as it warms up a little bit. It starts a bit dry then gets slightly acidic, finally finishing fully dry. Above average carbonation and a medium to full body.

Maybe I need to give this another try, but it really just is not as good as I was expecting. The aroma is interesting, but the flavor just comes up a bit short.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
3743,"2012-02-27",4.2,"Bottle from Hyvee in West Omaha, NE, USA
Poured into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass
11.340 stamped on label.

Pours a big, fluffy, hefeweizen-style off-white head that bubbles down to a centimeter-thick layer of tiny bubbles for the duration of the drinking session. As the foam descends, it leads to modest lacing on the sides of glass, giving one a clear view of beers deep mahogany color under normal lighting and light amber or garnet colors when held up to the bulb. Smoky and hazy in appearance due to the yeast, allowing just enough light through to see shadow imprints of my hand on the glass. Nearly perfect.

Aroma opens with musty yeastiness, bananas, and mild wheat malt.  This is followed by a solid brown sugar scent, concluding with dark, dried fruit aromas, such as prunes, with added mild alcohol.

Taste opens with strong, dark wheat malt joined closely to flavors of vanilla, brown sugar, and prunes or figs.  General pie spice spiciness is present, a bit of nutmeg joined to the heat of cloves.  Closes with slightly tart wheat malt and caramelized sugar sweetness joined to modestly detectable ethanol.  Aftertaste is of wheat malt twang with caramelized sugar and mild yeast.

Medium to medium-heavy body with modest carbonation that leads to a pillowy, comfortingly smooth mouthfeel. Mildly bitter, dry aftertaste that leaves one wanting more.","Wyoming, USA","tibicinoid"

Light brown colour with a large, three -finger sized head that is a brownish white in appearance, foamy in texture and has very good retention.

Banana & clove flavours with some bubblegum. There is a bit of grain & alcohol in the taste too as a result of the 8.2% abv. but this doesnt negatively affect the beer too much. There is a hint of caramel and a mild bitter end.

Smooth and well carbonated with a creamy, sweet feel to the drink and that it went down rather well.

This one had a good wheat taste with the caramel complimenting the banana, clove and bubblegum flavours very well in both taste and smell. It was a great beer and the huge 8.2% abv. was mostly very well hidden.

3743,"2011-10-04",4.3,"Ported from BA.

Appearance:
Pours a hazy brown that you cant quite see through. About a finger of head that dissipates like soda foam, into a few thin white islands sitting around the top.

Smell:
Very very wheaty, basically exactly what I imagine an unfiltered wheat to taste like. Strong banana notes come through the initial scent, with just a touch of lemony zest in the background.

Taste:
Semi-sweet, wheaty, and boozy. The banana scent is present in the flavor, as well as some very subtle chocolate notes under the immediate flavors. Little to no notable bitterness. Not quite like anything else Ive ever tasted.

Mouthfeel:
Full and thick. This almost feels heavier than a normal liquid on my tongue. Low carbonation and very smooth.

Drinkability:
After just a few mouthfuls I can feel the alcohol bearing down on me, which is fair enough at 8.2%, though I feel like its still hitting me very fast. That being said, Id have another. The fact is this is a delicious beer that I wouldnt possibly pass up at a liquor store if I could get it in my area.

3743,"2011-09-28",3.8,"Bottle from The Cask, Glasgow.
Appearance - Muddy brown, very hazy, huge off-white frothy head, moderate lacing.
Aroma - Complex aroma - a darker, stronger maltier version of a hefeweizen. Spicy aromatic cloves and fruity - typical banana with bubblegum. Caramel and bready malts, bit of roast malt, sweet dark malts, yeasty, hint of toffee. Lots going on here.
Taste - Complex mix of sweetish dark malts, fairly strong cloves, spicy hops, yeasty, wheat, molasses, raisin, bit medicinal. Alcohol not noticeable, initially, but becomes more so afterwards.
Palate - Full bodied, smooth. Finish a continuation of the main flavours, but there is a bit of cinnamon and warming alcohol.
Overall - Its a very well made beer, but this style of beer isnt my favourite - the bananary cloves and aromatic nature of these brews can get a bit cloying for me after a while. The darker malts do offset this a bit in this beer, but the alcohol gets more noticeable while drinking down the glass. Perhaps, Ill like these beers more in time.

T - Starts off with some spicy yeast and clove quickly giving way to a mix of chewy wheat, banana, caramel, and some dark fruits. As it warms, it seems to get a bit sweeter and more and more of the booze comes through. The finish is a mix of spicy yeast and banana, lingering for some time after the finish.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Fairly smooth with a spicy, chewy, feel with a touch of sweetness toward the end, lingering through the finish.

O - This is one awesome beer and it deserves all the acclaim it gets. It has a ton of flavor without getting to the point of being overpowering. If you have the chance to try this one you really should.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

3743,"2011-08-13",3.9,"1/2 liter bottle from local liquor store. Out of the bottle with a loud, hissing pour, this brew has a cloudy, opaque iced tea colored body with a long lasting tan head. While pouring, I noticed an immediate, complex aroma featuring coffee, cherry, floral, licorice, lime scents. At first sip, this surprisingly light, almost watery texture is paired with flavors of root beer, ice cream malt and tootsie roll with the lingering, tangy aftertaste of tangerine. My only issue of this beer is the imperceptible hop flavor.","Connecticut, USA","joebudzjoe"

The nose is sweet clover honey, molasses, tons of caramel malt, malty wheat cereal, and sweet grape juice.  The flavor is sweet Concord grape juice up front, moving to clover honey, dark cereal and caramel malt, molasses, and a bit of alcoholic heat.  The body is medium with tongue-numbingly stinging carbonation and a long grape juice, honey, and burnt caramel malt finish with a nice blast of alcoholic heat.

The aroma is very complex and elegant, with lots of dark fruits and ripe banana, some cloves, some caramel, some ethanol, some licorice, and wheat. I would definitely say theres some overripe fruits to it, too, but in the best possible way. Really, if you want to find out how in the world one could characterize anything as smelling ""overripe"" and mean it in a good way, sniff the **** out of this beer.  The taste mostly reflects the aroma; to the tongue this beer is sweet, a bit sour, a bit bitter, and has a good aftertaste. The body is medium, nearly perfect, and very wheaty.

Slightly creamy texture and a mild hop bite.  The spices are left behind in the aftertaste with some cream.   Just noticed that there is a decent layer of sediment in the bottle but its settled out so firmly that you can pour out the last drop without any noticeable residue which is incredible for a wheat beer!

3743,"2011-02-09",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2012 Ahhh Aventinus, oe of my favorites, heres a proper review. 500ml bottle, with the old label (purple one, apparently its white now).

Pours with a nice active head, thank you bottle conditioning, the head is slightly darker than off-white and recedes pretty quickly leaving splotches of lace. The beer is one of my favorite looking ones of all time, especially with the tall creamy head. It is a vibrant amber/brown/rad, darker than your typical Weizenbock, of course its a Doppelweizenbock or Weizenstarkbier, but apparently its not distinct enough to BA to make it a style.

The smell is an intensified version of the normal weizen bock, thick dark fruits and banana are the main parts with the great yeast twang and alcoholic kiss following. There is also hints of apple skin, clove, and brown sugar.

THis is one bold tasting monster, the flavors smack you in the face, with heavy yeast in the flavor, banana, dark fruits, some spiciness, a faint kiss of hop, and the alcohol. The carbonation is a great tool to permeate your tongue with amazing flavor.

This beer kicks major, major ass.

3743,"2011-02-03",4.3,"Presentation: (Part of a 5 pack gift set with glass.) It was poured from a brown 500ml bottle into the Aventinus glass that came with the beer. The label on the bottle has the abv (8.2%) and a description of the beer on the back. There is no freshness date but there seems to be a batch number or bottle code on the back label.

Appearance: It produces a thick and tall head which is light tan in color and settles out quickly. This makes for just a little slick lacing on the glass. The body has a rich mahogany color and hazy flat look.

Smell: The aroma is fruity and yeasty. There are some big banana and bready yeast like notes with mild clove and sweet booze. There is only a faint trace of hops.

Taste/Palate: The flavor has a sweet and fruity, medium to full bodied character with all the wonderful notes picked up in the nose.

Weizenbock can be tought of as (Doppel)bock whose grist bill includes some wheat malt therefore its organoleptic qualities should be a mixture of (Doppel)bock and German wheat beer. So,...the aroma is bock-like melanoidins, bready malt, ripened plum, clove phenolics, banana esters and evident alcohol. The palate is on the sweet side with bock-like melanoidins, dark fruits (plums and raisins), wheat flavor, clove and spicy alcohol that helps to balance the malt and brings warming sensation.

3743,"2011-01-03",4.1,"Actually-this is my first experience with this beer.

A- Body is a uniformly translucent rich chestnut brown hue. Pours with a 1-2 finger foamy slightly off-white head which eventually fades to a thick collar-very little lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- I understand that this is a weizenbock- but the nose is very BSDA in nature- dark fruit-plum, raisin- come out the most initially in the nose. There is a mild banana bread essence in the background.

T- Taste upfront is mild and offers dark fruit (as discribed above) with an accent of banana and clove- and a nice bready yeast backbone. The finish is a bit spicier and more typical for the style as the banana bread essence really comes through and the dark fruit disappears. What is left to linger is bready yeast and a bit of spice.

M- Medium to high carbonation and a smooth yeasty body.

D- This is a great, well put together Weizenbock. Im surprised that this is the first time I have tried it as it is clearly top notch for the style- and I like this style (despite its huge variation). A reminder why I love German beers so much-although I tend to overlook them.

I found this 500ml bottle for $4!! Its also always refreshing to see this brew in the top 100 (deviating form the IPA, stout, barrel aged, sour dominated list). Fantastic, classic example of the style to measure others to.

AROMA: Strong aroma of alcohol and yeast, very pleasant opposite the burger I was having.

APPEARANCE: Difficult to tell because the place was so dark, but: dark mahogany brown with a light-brown head, leaves generous lacing on the glass as its drunk

TASTE: Wow. What an experience. The alcohol detected on the nose is almost invisible in the taste, a welcome sight for such a high ABV beer. Opens with a bready flavor that quickly progresses into a light, smooth berry flavor (blackberries and currants?) with the faintest hint of clove and banana. 

PALATE: Unlike other doppelbocks Ive tried, this one was extraordinarily light. It lacks the weight I would ordinarily expect, but this wasnt a bad thing - it complemented the heavier flavors I was getting from the food.

3743,"2010-08-14",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2013 Outstanding massive head. Gorgeous brown with hints of red. Wheat and funk aroma. Burnt sugar and brown ale notes. Lots of pungent malt. Alcohol burn on the way down; red hots candy. World class. ...... 2013 rerate: bottled 30 May 2012, consumed 13 December 2013. A perfect pour (if I do say so myself) into a Weizen glass.....

The appearance is brown/orange at the thin parts, russet and brick red at the thick parts. 

After aging 18 months, the profile is yeast-forward: bready, a touch of clove. And earthy, herbal aroma. The funk in the nose is quasi-Belgian, and actually tickles the nasal cavity. The aromatic perfume is intoxicating (figuratively speaking). Aroma of bubblegum.

The flavor is purple: Muscat grapes and flowery yeast. There are touches of sweet sugar, but any possibility of a cloying, saccharine sweetness is completely balanced by the tartness of the yeast. Whatever barnyard flavors might be there are immediately mitigated by the tart yeast and the sweet grape-like malts.

Feels a tad ashy on the palate, but quickly washed over with a slick exterior.

This is one of the best beers on planet Earth. It would not only be great for a beer geek, but would be a wonderful gateway beer to bring people into the world of Weizenbocks.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

3743,"2010-08-01",3.7,"Enjoyed from a 16.9oz bottle in an English pint glass.  The beer pours a hazy medium brown color, with a moderate off-white head.  The nose gives the classic profile of a hefeweizen, with nearly equal parts banana and spicy clove.  The palate is an interesting amalgamation of the esters of the yeast strain, and the addition of a more aggressive malt backbone.  The former seems to come out on top of the latter, in a way that is quite pleasing and drinkable.  Spicy notes, banana, a slight residual sweetness, and slight depth-adding alcohol flavors come through.  Carbonation is present enough to bring out flavor and mouthfeel, without whitewashing the entire palate with its own show.

S: Delicate. Refined. Perfected. Bananas. Wheat. Yeast. Clove. Dried raisins. Figs. Cherries. A bit of caramel and an ever so slight alcohol.

T: The taste is intricate. Perfectly transitioning between the lighter banana and wheat notes to the richer raisin, fig, cherry and caramel notes. Alcohol is slight, and let you know you are drinking a big brew.

3743,"2010-05-23",3.9,"Limited Edition Brewed in 2003, bottled in 2004, and consumed today. Bottle wrapped in white tissue paper with ""brewed in 2003"" print all over it.

Appearance: Dark brown, borderline black body with a good 2 finger head that is the slightest shade of almond. Decent head retention and some lacing which is impressive for a 5 year old brew.

Smell: Wheat, Clove, Dark Roasted Malts

Taste: Your standard wheat / clove / toasted malt Aventinus with an additional slightly vinous note. The vinous quality is quite minimal at this point and perfect in my opinion. Its also counterbalanced by a taste of chocolate.

Mouthfeel: full bodied yet thin. Ample carbonation.

Drinkability: Much more drinkable than a fresh Aventinus in my humble opinion. The wine/chocolate flavors that become more pronounced with age are creating a playful complexity that the fresh Aventinus lacks.

Im thinking that 5 years of aging this brew is ideal for my tastes. I still have a line on getting more of these 2003 limited editions and I think I will.

A very easy to drink beer and the ABV is very well hidden. Feels like I could take on a couple of pints of this but I bet I would have to pay for it in the morning.

I like this beer and Im really interested in trying more beers from the brewery. Ive had their Eisbock of this beer (12,2%) and I actually think that is a better beer. I ended up giving it a 4,2 which is an excellent score.

Even though its quite strong I think this would be a good companion with most kinds of food. Its thirst quenching yet has enough flavour to be interesting, but not enough to be overwhelming. If that makes any sense. Basically if you see it you should definitely try it.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

A - Deep brown with a large foamy ivory head. Very good retention and a good amount of lacing left over.

S - Dark malt and chocolate along with a good amount of fruit (both dark fruit and banana). Faint spices too.

T - Dark malt flavors provide a base, which includes, chocolate and caramel along with some wheat flavors. On top of this is a good amount of sweetness from fruits. Fruits include dark fruits (plums, dates, figs, raisins, and cherries) as well as banana. Also has a bit of a bubblegum flavor and some spices (clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg being the major ones). A bit of a warming alcohol taste finishes the sip.

M - Medium to full body with a fairly high level of carbonation. Creamy and sticky feel make it feel even more full bodied.

D - Probably a bit too sweet and a bit too heavy (as well as too high an ABV) to have multiple ones of this in one sitting, at least consecutively. However, a sipper that I would gladly sip on again.

The aroma is dominated by the expected clove character, but also includes plum, raisins, banana and wood. To generalize a bit here, the flavor of the beer reminds me of a belgian in many ways, but possesses a more forward bitterness than most darker belgian brews. Lots of raisin, cloves, port, vanilla, caramel, and an overriding herbal hop bitterness that serves to clean things up very nicely. I get the feeling that this could easily have been a big, messy beer, but everything comes together very nicely. Though pretty sweet, its never too much in that regard.

I poured this into a weizen glass (duh) and the head was aggressively foamy and cream colored. The actual beer is dark, cloudy brown with red at the bottom and edges. It smells very yeasty, cloves, and spice. Tastes like spice, clove, yeast, wheat,some chocolate (barely), and some dark fruit, little apricot (which I havent had in years). Alcohol was unnoticeable but the phenols were certainly there. Good stuff.

Crystal and possibly chocolate malt combine with the lighter wheat to create a very interesting mix of flavours. Dark fruit is once again evident, along with more caramel and some alcohol, which lingers in a very pleasant finish, much like a belgian strong ale.
Mouthfeel is a balancing act between the refreshing light body of a weizen the fullness of a rich, malty brew.

Purchased a bottle of the aged variety, 2009.

Pours dark brown, hazy. Same head, no lacing. The first difference is the aroma: like that German carbonated apple-juice. Strange, but thats what I get now. Flavor is less banana than before, more subdued, kind of just dark fruits at the beginning, then turning into a long chocolate/port finish. The alcohol must have gone up from 8.2, but it is still well hidden, and the entire thing comes together nicely. Awesome to get this beer for $5, and I didnt even have to muster the patience to age it myself.","Ithaca, New York, USA","Changed"

3743,"2009-04-09",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2010 nose of weizen yeast esthers, but more subdued or subtle then even some regular-grade weizens.  the flavor reveals why some of those aromas are stifled: nearly opaque ruby appearance leads to flavors of pit fruits and dark herbal qualities.  mouthfeel remains just as smooth and feathery as a regular weizen, but with amped up flavors that go beyond the somewhat sweet and airy notes typically found.  the dark apperance defies the easily likable interior of esters and love laced fruits.  i had the eisbock before this (which i enjoyed immensely) but i feel like i just took a weight off my shoulders, for this is so drinkable i am staggered as a result.  overall maybe a fresher specimen would have provided greater fruits as i have experienced in other weizen bocks but this still sits in a very comfortable position amongst the greatest beers i know of, and one i will be returning to soon and often.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
3743,"2009-04-07",3.7,"1 pt .9 fl oz bottle.  Pleasant and airy aroma that noticeably adds well with the tasting experience as it kind of fires up the nostrils with every sip.  Slightly more clove and spice notes in the smell than expected.  Banana a strong player too, brown sugar, caramel-toffee cookie dough, as well as minor bubble gum.  A very pretty beer as the pour is great, nice inch and a half of part fluffy cream and part wispy milk head, a nice layer of retention,  full body appearance, dark golden amber in color.  The flavor profile is more heavy weighted toward the malty dopplebock side of the brew, something that the aroma would suggest otherwise.  A good amount of caramel cookie, mild fruits, yeast, and pears, with the more spicy, clove, and wheat grain elements fulfilling more of a background role. Some citrusy and grassy bitter elements come into play here maybe alittle more so than in the eisbock version.  The mouthfeel was not as nice as i was expecting from a beer this highly regarded. It was not bad, but a little too much carbonation. Balance was good, but the flavor profile overall to me also did not come together as well as in the eisbock.  So I would have to say Im alittle disappointed with this offering, but its still a very good beer overall.  Maybe I will need to rerate sometime in the future.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

3743,"2009-03-08",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2010 It was interesting. I had never had a wheat/doppel mixture. It turned it into a dark wheat beer which I was on the fence about.3.6
RE-RATE 6/29/10 thanks to Mike at the Ginger Man for this one. Dark murky color with heavy red colors. Floral notes with crayola and Belgian yeast. Taste is red fruit with yeast and light bread. Easy finish. A little better than I remember but for much different reasons.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
3743,"2009-03-05",4.5,"A- Huge fluffy off white head with some larger bubbles within that break making a rugged texture as the head drops. Great head retention but minimal lacing.

S- Lots of nice spicy and sweet aromas in the nose. Caramel and honey blend together in the to make nice sweet aromas along side some dark fruits and herbal spice. Some earthy aromas come through as well, hints of hay and grass, with a nice floral hop presence.

T- Lots of dark juicy fruit hits the tough, raisins apricot and plums. So sweet roasted almonds and nice caramel flavors blend nicely with the fruit flavors. The yeast adds a nice spicy herbal taste that brings out great character. Lets not forget the hops, Bring some nice bite to the palate and balance the flavors out with a nice citrus and pine bitter.

M- Very soft and silky medium bodied beer, great balance and good carbonation, I am not sure I could ask for more out of the mouth feel.

Overall this is a great beer, I love this stile, it is very soft but yet very complex. Great malt and hop character and the wheat does wonders. All the ingredients play well together in this brew.",", Minnesota, USA","br3wmeister"

Before the first sip, I drink in a complex aroma that includes the standard banana-clove trait, but also dried fruits, grain and a slight nuttiness. The smells carry over into the taste, but make up only a part of it: add big dark malt flavour, nutmeg, plums and a sweet finish. Theres a slight alcoholic burn, but its subtle considering the actual alcohol content. Full-bodied, smooth and a pleasure to drink from beginning to end.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","vanrassel"

Bottle brown, 500 ml
Appearance: Pours hazy fat brown, pastel in hue, gently carbonated body with ridiculously huge, off - white, brown, pillowy - frothy head, very vivid and form very regular near the beer base to rocky at the top. There is an impressive lacing, very compact firm head and well defined body colour, naturally brown.
Aroma: Very well pronounced, sweet and pleasant banana, intensive clove, rich in juicy sweetness of banana, coconut, gentle notes of milky chockolate, white chockolate, peanuts, gentle toastyness and notes of mature prune and plum spiced up with a kind of chalky harsh character. Despite its high alcoholic content it is perfectly hidden. Very complex with notes of vanilla and dunkel - roastyness. Notes of cherries, prune and resin.
Flavour: Nice full bodied flavour starting with mature oakyness, wood bark, very high bitterness for a weizen or a bock beer that binds your tongue at the very start, later this bitterness is covered with a gentle alcoholic warmth, later on the aftertaste becomes chalky and finally slighty accidic with gentle sweet accents of caramelly and prune. Impressively complex in flavours begining with banana - carrot - raspberry - clove oriented dimention to prune - plum - red grapes notes spiced up with a robust bitterness, gentle alcoholic dryness and crystalized honey accents. Nice aromatic complex nose. Really huge beer of 3 types of malt: wheat, Munich and seasonal combined with sophisticated yeast strains and hop types contributing to a perfume like nose.
Palate: Body is full, texture is moderately wattery, carbonation on palate is moderate, finish feel is complex, hifhly astringent, clean and intriguingly mineral.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

3743,"2008-08-17",4.5,"I first enjoyed G. Schneider & Sohn Aventinus beer at the Mainstreet Pub up in Melbourne, FL. it was love at first sip. I savored my Aventinus with much relish and pleasure while also nibbling on some delectable fresh almond brie, crackers, and grapes. It was beer meets food nirvana, and I almost didn’t come back. Thankfully it is now readily available to me here locally. Aventinus is a brew I must have on a regular basis, and I would also like to try aging one and giving it a tasting a year or two from now.

She pours from her bottle into my goblet a rich darkly moist earthen brown. A smooth fluffy head of foam forms at the top and slowly lingers into a soft cottony ring around the sides of my glass. In the nose I detect sweet whiffs of malt with a caramelized mix of prunes and other dark-pitted fruit. Essences of raisins and spices, cinnamon and nutmeg. The first quaff ~ heavenly. I am reminded again why I love this beer so much. Such delicate deep complexity in its palate. Despite looks, Aventinus has a rather light yet full body and mouthfeel with light effervescence which doesn’t weigh down the palate. Smooth, creamy and chewy, sweet caramel and prunes come to mind first. As the taste lingers on my buds, there is a pleasant dryness to the palate and pleasant warmth creeps up in the back of my throat, a testament to the high ABV of 8.2%. As I delve further into my Aventinus, small trails of Brussels lace take their time joining the rest of the brew in my glass. As she warms, I detect gentle flavors of prunes, raisins, and some nice nutmeg spice. From start to finish, Aventinus is a soft, delicate beer overflowing with a perfectly balanced blend of winter spice, warmth, rich and decadent prunes and raisins with malty notes. 

For whatever reason, I am reminded of Christmas and the holidays as I quaff my Aventinus. It could be the warmth of the beer, the soft yet full-bodied chewy mouthfeel which blends dark fruits and warm wintery spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. Truly a beautiful beer, there is no other wheat dopplebock like Aventinus.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3743,"2008-08-05",4.0,"...bottle from Cloudwine.  This stuff was very impressive.  On the nose, has raisins, grape, plum dark fruit like aroma, with hints of spicy clove.  Pours a dark browish red\purple, with an off white head that didn’t seem to last for me, but oh well.  On the tongue, it massages the taste-buds with a wheaty, slightly caramelitic, fruity goodness, with hints of clove in the finish.  Went down very well for such a high ABV, with almost no alcohol flavor. Not too heavy, with nice carbonation that distributes the many flavors. Very easy drinking, and I wish I had gotten two, or more.  I definitely want to find this on tap, but doubt I can here in Melbourne.

Strong banana flavor, with a huge clove kick as the beer warms.  Obviously a strong beer by the flavors, etc, but the alcohol is hidden.  No burn or flavor from the alcohol.

3743,"2008-08-01",4.3,"Maybe it was because I had this beer at Cafe Brucke in Milwaukee, where the owner is fastidious about presentation detail and the beer always seems super-fresh, but this tasted great to me.

It poured a dark but brilliant mahogany color into a weizen glass.  Lots of head with great staying power.  Aroma is clovey with a significant malt presence and quite pleasant.  Flavor is clovey, fruity, with some bock-like maltiness.  It is a substantial beer, but is not heavy and hides its ABV quite well.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp.  If youre looking for a 8.2% ABV that will go down great on a hot day, this is it.

Seriously, I dont know where Cafe Brucke gets their import beers, but they always look to be in mint condition.  If I bought this beer from Discount Liquor across town, it would be old, stale, and the bottle/label would be dust-covered and beat to hell.

The flavor has a rich caramel quality, with bubble-gum sweetness, bread, and a hint of alcohol.   Banana and clove are their, but don’t manifest as assertively as in the aroma.   full bodied with the same effervescent carbonation that you would find in a regular hef.

A complex balance of sweetness and grain, some bread-like qualities and clove, which I don’t like, but mainly a battle between sweet malt and dry wheat.  Unique.  It does have more of a doppelbock finish than a wheat finish, sticky.  Overall, unique and fair but I feel the two genres should remain divorced.","Oklahoma, USA","greedycheater"

First: the head on this is just silly, and the goofy glass didn’t help: it was like three inches of marshmallow cream; the most dense head I have yet encountered.  That sentence was needlessly prolonged by my choice of punctuation.

3743,"2008-07-10",4.6,"The first time I tried this beer on tap, I was blown away.  Never have I had a beer that was such a pleasure to enjoy.

Flavor contains a rich fruitiness that would best be described as a combination of raisins and well ripened apples.  Initially very complex, giving way to fruit flavors, followed by just the lightest tangy bitterness.  Just a hint of sourness.

Aroma is strongly clove like with a hint of apple cider, and chocolate.

Mouth feel is well carbonated and complex - makes you want to hold it in your mouth to enjoy all the flavors before swallowing, but a little bit thick.

Taste is an explosion of well balanced flavors, I’m getting a bit of ripe cherry, apples, raisins and caramel.

Highly recommended.  Can be purchased at CT Beverage Mart in Newington, CT, also available in bottles at The Half Door in West Hartford, CT.  First tried it as it was rotated on tap at Eli Cannons in Middletown, CT.

Well worth the $3.50 for a bottle as you won’t be disappointed.  The beer changes flavors and characteristics throughout the whole drinking experience.

Color is a rich Amber brown giving way to a reddish cloudy brown under light.  Because it’s bottle fermented, some solid particles floating around are normal.  Pours a nice thick head with good lacing.

Taste is a nice amalgam of the aforementioned aromas,  they dance a bit,  then bow out for a finish that is the opposite of cloying (unexpected but very nice, makes an otherwise sweet beer very drinkable) Alcohol shows up in the nostrils after a few sips, but is not harsh.

The nose is yeasty-cloves with warm bread overtones.  Very exciting aroma, make one want to drink.  The mouth feel is pleasant, full, creamy, light carbonation.  The taste in the front of the tongue is sweet citrus, but not ordinary orange or lemon... more like star fruit.  The sides of the mouth and cheeks pick up the cloves and the back of the throat get the tamed bitters.  After taste lingers cloves.

The aromas were molasses, celery, bubblegum, and banana.

The mouthfeel had medium carbonation.  Perfect feel on the tongue.

The taste was very sweet--that bubblegum flavour, I suppose--chased by cloves (which went undetected in the aroma for me).  The bitterness was all unsweetened cocoa, and there was a barely-noticeable warming from the higher alcohol content.

However the bitterness fades just as fast as it came on.","Levittown, New York, USA","Chapel"
3743,"2008-03-25",4.7,"Pours into a hefe-glass with a shaded redwood color, the stable and very present cloud of toasted ivory foam, hovers overhead. Warm banana spice cake tones find their way into your mind via the incredible nose of this Weizenbock. Malt and sweet plum flavors give way to a perfectly balanced, slightly tart, dark fruit finish. The mouth feel of this beer puts it over the top, giving it all the qualities of a incredibly crafted brew. The wheaty, medium bodied fresh finish lingers favorably until the next sip.

I dont get the hype with this one, quite sweet and sickly, porty with cloves and various spices and a big dose of nasal alcohol, but for a beer to be looked forward to it is a bit lacking.

A lot of spices, like clove, in the taste together with banana. I think Im going to have many of these in the summer... nearly perfection.

Comments: A very nice ale, overall, and an amazing array of flavors. Much different from all of the American beers Ive been enjoying. The subtlety of flavor compounds, texture, and aroma are exquisite. A fine ale, but not necessarily the first thing Id go for, though for someone who appreciates complex and fruity flavors, its an amazingly complex and inviting drink.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"
3743,"2008-03-08",4.5,"wow what a great beer whether on tap or from a bottle this beer is up front , it is amazing because I am not into fruit or chocolate notes in my beer but this has a definate banana and chocolate taste but by the time you have swallowed the taste is gone and you actually need and want more and more,,, wow enough anyway you can get your hands on it","ridgefield, Connecticut, USA","delirium2"
3743,"2008-03-08",4.1,"There is a strong aromatic presence of clove that intertwines with a yeasty and sweet smell reminiscent of bananas. As for appearance, it is a cloudy caramel with a light cream colored head that disappears quickly. The flavor begins with a clove oriented spice mix which rolls into a nutty taste and ends with a very slight sour and tangy taste. It leaves a fizzy sensation on the tip of my tongue and creates a slight film on the roof of my mouth, however, for the rest of the texture it is slightly creamy and very smooth. Overall this is a complex beer that encompasses a myriad of pleasures for the mouth to furnish the drinker with a good experience; I will definitely be partaking in this beer again.","USA","TylerJ"
3743,"2008-03-07",4.2,"Pours a cloudy reddish brown with about three fingers of rapidly dissipating white head.  Prune, caramel, and just a general kick of malts hits you with the aroma.  Really soft mouthfeel, it starts off with a hint of clove and spice, and morphs into a light caramel malt and banana aftertaste.  Almost a creamy, Id say ""velvety"" mouthfeel.  This is just a overall solid beer.","USA","naivepegasus"
3743,"2008-03-06",4.5,"This one of those beers that if you try it during your craft beer infancy, itll just absolutely stun you with its deliciousness.  Pours just like the picture basically, khaki colored head eventually settles into a creamy long lasting foam.  Aroma is very spicy and jumps into your nose with cloves, mild banana, smoke, hay, caramel, brown sugar, holiday bread, and maybe even a bit of gouda cheese.  Taste of cloves and spices at first followed by a nice caramel sweetness, raisins, a bit of smoke on the roof of the mouth, some grass.  Finishes with a bit of banana and fruit flavor, followed by a sort of nutty tasting dry sensation, slightly tangy.  Highly carbonated, but very creamy feeling, drinks effortlessly.  This is the absolute benchmark of what a weizenbock should be and to boot, its top-rated and widely available.  What more can you want?","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
3743,"2008-03-03",4.6,"This beer turned me into a borderline alcoholic last week. I blew like 100 dollars on this beer, I actually bought out the local store that sells it, and after that I bugged the stock guy to tell me when theyre getting another shipment in.

8.2 alcohol/volume, but you can barely taste the alcohol.

Drink two of these and youll be feeling right.

aroma reminds me of cafeau lait mixed up with grapes, wood, and a slight hint of butterscotch.

tastes almost like candy, and must contain alot of sugar...I say this because I spilled a few drops and within seconds, it was ultra sticky on my skin. How to explain the taste? Butterscotch, grapes and other fruits I cant identify, along with woody/earthy notes. You can barely taste the alcohol, but believe me, after half a bottle youll definately know its there.

Gorgeous off-white head of 2 fingers. Beer takes on an appetizing dark caramel hue. 

Smells like BANANA BREAD. Banana from the wheat, bread from the malt: literally smells exactly like banana bread. 

The taste follows the smell but carries some spiciness and a hint of maple syrup. The 8.2% alcohol becomes apparent as the beer warms. 

This beer strikes a balance between the warmth of the alcohol and the refreshingness that comes with any good weissbier. Leaves the mouth a bit sticky though. 

Less drinkable than a hefeweizen, more drinkable than a doppelbock, imagine that! Wish there was a 4.25 for this category, but gave it the benefit of the doubt.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Note:  Had the aged (2002) Aventinus Easter Night, which was appropriate, since it tasted like Jesus died and was resurrected in this beer.  Would rate it a 4.9 (not using this rating since most people will have the non-aged variety).

Much more of a caramel and chocolate aroma, with subdued spices and hints of banana. I find more molasses, chocolate, caramel, bread, with only a little bit of banana.

I bought this bottle in Wisconson on my last beer run right before Christmas. Im excited to try an aged Aventinus and wonder what the differences are between the 5 to 6 year aged and the original. I dont know if its because of the aging process, but there is a little white powderof some sort around the rim underneath the cap.

The beer pours out a little less head than a fresh hefeweizen, but I can only guess that that is due to the aging process. The lacing is a little less pronounced. The same dark brown color is present, but looks more inviting.

Smell is very spicy and very fruity and flavorful. Its excellent! It has so many flavors like raspberry. Its very mellow with a little more coffee tone.

The taste is familiar, but with slightly different tones. I taste a dark fruit that is light. I also taste clove with a hint of nutmeg.

3743,"2007-10-24",4.2,"How is it that Ive managed to log in nearly a thousand reviews and miss this beer? Ive had this a dozen times or more, and for some reason I just checked and havent reviewed it. So to fix that oversight, Ive popped the cap on a bottle and plan to review. 

The nose on this beer is really, really insane. There are complexities everywhere. I could pick up notes of overripe bananas, toffee, milk chocolate, raisins, caramel and the wheat notes. Appearance is clear with a reddish brown hue, almost diet cola in color with a nice off-white head. Flavors are equally solid as the nose and combine damn near in perfect harmony. Sweet malts, banana, dark overripe fruit, toffee, caramel with a subtle bite of alcohol to remind you that its an 8% beer. Excellent beer. I highly recommend you getting one wherever you can.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

It pours dark brown with some sediment and a large head.  Aroma has the sweetness and wheat of normal Aventinus. The flavor seems more complex. There is the sweetness but also more malt and bannanas. wonderful mouthfeel and great aftertaste. This does add a point or two over the normal unaged.","Charlotte, USA","jobyone"

Hazy reddish brown, tight cream head. Not as bananaey as I remember it, but its definitely there on the nose, along with a sweet brown maltiness. Smooth and lively on the tongue. Banana is also in the taste, but the majority of that is a sticky-sweet spicy malt body. Im not going to say coriander, but there certainly is a hint. All of that hangs around in the mouth for ages.

The aroma is most obviously banana, dark malt and clove, but other spices and fruity yeast esters add more complexity. The flavour clove, bubble-gum (yeast), dark candied fruit, dates and figs and that grainy wheat taste.

The pour was dark ruby with lighter copper notes to it.  The head was a meager one-finger tall of white to off-white bubbles that only offered up minimal lacing.  The aroma was cloves, malt and brown sugar.  The flavor was very clove-forward with malt, banana and some apple/pear.  The flavors were contained and refined, not explosive.

Estery aroma of bananas and clove play among a spicy bouquet of apples, pears, and a thin rose grape.  Fruity and spicy, abandoning all things seemingly German about this beer for a bit of Belgian flair.  Light bodied, spritzy carbonated mouthfeel.  Tons of munich malt up front on the palate, with a chewy nutty quality that compliments the spicy esters quite well.  Apples, mild chocolate, and delicate caramel come through, although the body is exceptionally light and easy drinking.  The effervescence of the brew seems to detract a little bit for my palate by allowing the malt complexities to sizzle away more quickly than desirable.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a cloudy, medium brown and was bottle conditioned with a large, slightly off-white head that mostly lasted but left virtually no lacing. The aroma was very light mikl chocolate, light yeast, and wheat and spices. The initial flavor was light to moderate sweetness, light acidity and sourness, while the finish was moderate to heavy sweetness with an average duration.

Aventinus is a special, distinctive beer. Theres the typical banana note from the wheat, and an unmissable clove aroma.

Unlike the gastly high alcohol content Quebec beers with pics of  guys canoeing towards a waterfall, this  beer actually has flavour without being overwhelmed by its high alcohol content.  Good example of style and huge flavours of fruit, spice & yeast ala Chimay, but not for everybody.  Id rather have a flavourful pale lager or pilsner, that doesnt require such a time committment & is far more approachable.  Do we really need a beer with this much flavour, that is also this strong?  I do think the monk on the bottle looks very authoritative - maybe monks have the kind of time to drink octane like this & nurse pints of this stuff for hours on end.  I can picture myself enjoying this in winter or late fall when a football game is on the tube around 7 & I need to feel good but dont want to drink a lot of beer - 3 beers for the price of 1.

Pours a sludgy brown colour (similar to apple cider), with an insane head that will appear and persist regardless of your best efforts to reduce it while pouring. Initial tastes are just yeast and alcohol, and its pretty unpleasant, with a salty aspect to it. But, as it warms it definitely opens up. Suddenly more sweet aromas are apparent, plums, apricots, even a little bubble gum.

Starts with a very bright hop begining and a nice clove ending.  But between that there is a beautiful under layer of apricot flavors.  Didnt taste the chocolate flavors so much.  My favorite of the german wheats because of its complexity, flavor, and drinkability.  In any case a master of the genre.","Pennsylvania, USA","gmcase"

Dense, dried fruit and candy sugar aroma; hints of a creamy vanilla note.  Lively carbonation; fluffy texture.  Full, wheaty mouthfeel: dense toffee and dried red fruits; very chewy, very satisfying weizen bock; nicely textured with a dense malt core; hints of alcohol poking through.

A full bodied beer with some alcohol in the taste, caramel, lots of banana. Some white pepper elements in the taste that I find unenjoyable. Cloves and hints of black chocolate with a decent sourness and sweetness. Rather strong alcohol presence in the finish (quite dry) with hints of licorice. It s not a bad beer, but I didnt enjoy it that much. I had this beer several times, even 3.3 seems too high in my opinion. Really dissapointing.","SWITZERLAND","Embrouille"

Aroma of bananas, clove, dough, and yeast.  The flavors are clean at first, banana and clove, until I get all of that yeast in there. Then a much creamier smoother banana, toffee, chocolate full bodied from the wheat.  Tasty beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"

Initially get the dried fruit sweetness, smoothing into bananas and cloves, and finally with a hint of wheat in the finish.  Very nice lingering aftertaste.  Even a touch of heat  (alcohol) at the end.  There is just a ton going on in this one, yet it is subtle and really well rounded.  Very nice.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3743,"2007-05-30",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2011 1) Muddy deep brown weizen capped with off-white, receding suds. Swirls with sediment against the light. Aromas to drown in- banana liqueur and clovey spice with a fusty edge of wood-tinged sourness. Overripe bananas dipped in melted toffee and dusted with clove and white pepper. Big, toffeeish malt drying out into a clipped, slightly warming finish. But the alcohol is beautifully disguised. Drinks like a seductively spicy Hefe/St Bernardus/Sour Ale hybrid. Blindfolded Id swear it was Belgian. How the Germans conjure something as headily fruity and spicy as this out of just malt, hops, yeast, wheat and water is nothing short of a marvel. The sort of beer youd name your children after.   
2) Bottle Inspire, Coventry. Just WOW. Full-on banana and clove; a mouthful of heady, sahti-like esters. Texture of milkshake. Made the Orval I had afterwards taste like flat lemonade.

Has a very nice burgundy color with lots of visible carbonation and a rocky 2 finger tan head that reminded me of bath bubbles. Straw, wheat, nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and the aroma of a bread box are all present. Taste is Sweet with nutmeg, cinnamon, wheat, banana, vanilla, and dried fruits. Aftertaste of Wheat, vanilla, banana, clove, and some other spices Im unsure of. A nice medium body, but way too much carbonation. It almost burned a little bit. Great beer!

Oddly, but pleasantly, it was all tied together with a strong bubble gum scent. Mouthfeel was full, creamy and perfectly effervescent. The flavor is amazing. A sweet, creamy plum up front, with caramel, cloves and banana at the finish. A slight wheat note can be detected at the end but is quickly overridden by the malts and light alcohol upon exhale.

Re-rate: Babyfood banana and clove aroma. Hazy brown, thick tan head. Bready banana, but not banana bread, flavor. Alcohol noticeable, but only slightly detracting.

My buddy and I pulled ours out of the fridge and held them for a moment to let them warm.  They poured a deep red-brown with a nice puffy head.  As this dissipates, and the flavors waft from the glass, my nose perks up.  Toffee, caramel, figs and huge esters pop out immediately.  The flavor is rich and luxurious.  It has the softness and drinkability of a traditional german hefeweizen, the rich malt character of a delicious dopplebock, and the intense estery aroma of a belgain tripel or summer siason.

Strong carbonation, and it almost overtakes the flavor.  This is good, but I think I prefer the Weizen Eisbock over this as it is more full bodied.  Even though this beast comes in at 8.2% ABV, the flavor just falls a little short.  Good, but not amazing, as I expected since the Eisbock was stunning and this actually scores a bit higher than that beer.

3743,"2007-01-15",4.3,"A memorable night in Manchester - my first night in England - hit its best note as I sipped on this revelation of a brew in the Castlefield district, talking football and politics with a rail-line worker from Birmingham.  But, trust me, its not just sentimentality that makes this one a complete knockout.  Pours a  ruddy brown with a massive white head - made even that much more beautiful because it was in that proper piece of glassware you all see to the left.  Head fades but never entirely, maybe a half-inch at its lowest point.  The nose is such an explosion of aromas:  funky wheat notes like tart citric acid, plums and berries, strong and nearly abrasive caramel, dark malt balance touched off by just a hint of spice.  On the tongue, spice and dark malt intertwine themselves with a veritable cornucopia from the fruit spectrum...bananas, dark stone fruits, apples.  Everything finishes with another reminder that what were drinking here is brewed with wheat, in that slightly funky, slightly sour after that is eminently hard to place.  Full and rich in the mouth while retaining loads of carbonated integrity.  Quite possibly the first beer ever that, when I order it up again (and I will), it will undoubtedly transport me back to that night in Manchester, completely alone but completely content, wandering the streets in some kind of half-jet-lag-half-amazed stupor.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

Smell; lots of wheat and lemons, some hints of bananas. Theres sweet caramel, bread and dark malts. The mix of wheat beer and dopplebock aromas go together better than I thought they would.

Taste; lemons, bananas and cloves are all present, along with a definite wheat profile. The sweet malts, caramel and dark fruits make their presence known on the back end. This is a great combination a wheat and dopplebock flavors. Mouthfeel is medium to full, and so drinkable I have to make myself slow down a bit with the big abv.

3743,"2007-01-10",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Behold, the tastes of the Teutonic forest - the very same one that devoured Romes persistent legionnaires, and the essence of the Schneider Aventinus.  A lot of this beer smacks of deciduous deliciousness, brought on by a naturally gentle mouth feel and an abundant collection of subtle but poignant flavors.  This is entirely different from the Aventinus Wiezen Eisbock, though they both may look alike.  Both don purple and gold, and both have Wiezen bock Eisenfivenfluerhauven printed about 28 times on the bottle, but this is a beer entirely on its own.  The head is very thick but very flat, like a clean cut tree stump, sitting about as still as possible, and receding with a grumble of disfavor.  The body is darker, with shades of red to compose a rich mahogany color, transporting me to a long lost English library of vibrant warmth and cozy trappings.  From the first sniff I can tell this is going to be a hard beer to review.  The nose articulates, but softly and almost inaudibly.  Hints of apple, cheese, oak and butternut squash barely prod the olfactory nerve endings.  It takes a lot of effort, but it is a perfume well worth it.  A dab behind the ears might be the perfect scent for an evening down at the country club.  The flavors are similarly delicate, and must be tread upon lightly to keep the atmosphere intact.  Beyond the quiet whispers of the beers mouth feel, there lie some soft and mild almonds, chestnuts and hazelnuts to provide some simultaneous meatiness and woodiness.  These are squared away with a light, soft goats cheese to balance one soft flavor with another.  The taste then transforms to a light woody tone, dropping the assorted nuts and shifting to full fledged oak.  Some hops frazzle the preceding delicate tones, but helps to whip up a full and satisfying foaminess as a backdrop to the composite taste.  The bubbly mouth feel is omnipresent, but caressing and embracing like a Kashmir sweater.  The aftertaste is even more comfortable, keeping a token scrap of oak and hops to lick on like a refined and genteel gobstopper.  Noticeably lacking in this description is any kind of fructose, glucose, sucrose or galactose, and thats because there really isnt any.  The only sugar I do pick up, and only when I direct my attention to it, is a smattering of clumped dark brown sugar.  I also noted the absence of any fruits, usually finding plum, apple or banana in a mixture like this.  No colorful sweets from nature this time around.  Only the dry and earthy concoction that makes this so well suited for a feast of the forest.  I cant help but think of my Middle School obsession with the Red Wall series and the foods they described.  This would have fit in nicely.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3743,"2007-01-04",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2008 Poured a reddish-amber with some thin white head. The aroma was filled with cloves and some banana.  The taste echoed the aromas, again with cloves  being the dominant flavor. There was a faint caramel taste as well, followed by alcohol. The finish was yeasty.  In comparison to the only other weizenbock Ive had (Moonglow), the clove aroma and taste was much more evident.  Additionally, this brew didnt transform completely like the Moonglow did when it warmed up.  Im a big fan of this one.


                      2001 paper-wrapped version, sampled 4/25/07.  The older version was a way different animal, smelling of caramel and dark fruits, somewhat brandy-ish. It kind of reminded me of some barleywines Ive had, which I thought was pretty interesting. The aged version had more of a dark fruity taste, along with a stronger caramel flavor. It was also noticeably boozier and less carbonated. My girlfriend preferred the fresh version, mainly because the older one was boozier. As for me, its tough to choose. Theyre both so different. As it ended up due to the ladys preference, I had more of the older version and I enjoyed it a lot. I suppose Id lean toward the aged version if I really really had to choose.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

3743,"2006-12-28",3.8,"16.9 oz. bottle, split with my dad. Classic, appetizing hefeweizen aroma, though a bit sweeter and stronger, with the familiar clove and cinnamon elements. Pours an amber/brown color with a large amount of off-white to tan head. Sparkling, clear liquid. The doppelbock flavor dominates the wheat. Aventinus tastes like a strong European lager with weisse overtones. The malt is prominent, but so, somewhat surprisingly, are the hops. The alcohol is noticeable in the flavor, but its not overpowering. Crisp, drinkable, and refreshing in the palate, but nothing out of the ordinary. Light to medium bodied.

<P>This is a good and interesting brew, but it is underwhelming. I expected more from what is, according to the raters at this site, Germanys second best beer. It tastes literally like a mix of a good wheat beer with a good doppelbock, as if done in the glass at home or a bar rather than in the early stages at the brewery. The weisse dominates the aroma while the bock dominates the taste. I would classify this beer as a Double Weisse Bock rather than a Weizen Bock, as ""weizen"" to me implies an unfiltered and cloudy brew, whereas this beer is filtered and clear like a ""weisse."" Aventinus would make a perfect beer for the early warm days of spring, when the sun is inviting and warm but there is still a chill in the air.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

3743,"2006-12-19",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2007 500 mL bottle.  Deep brown (wouldnt quite call it ""ruby"" - more orange/copper), with thick beige head.  Aroma of spice, alcohol, and the old banana/clove thing.  Flavour goes through at least three distinct stages, as the alcohol enhances, rather than smothers each.  Initially you get the alcohol, which then sweetens into a bit of caramel, along with the usual wheat beer flavours.  The finish is interesting as well: it begins bitter, but gradually sweetens.  This beer sweetens significantly as it warms, but the alcohol does not become more prominent.  Incredibly smooth and full.  Excellent.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"

Flavours take what is offered by the aroma, but add in a slighty bitter and sour character that cuts through the wheat at the finish. Alcohol is well hidden, but not invisible.

Begins innocently enough, then overtakes the palate and especially the nasopharynx with a sledgehammer of cocoa-accented clove flavor.  Hint of alcohol is also apparent.  Significant carbonation combined with fairly full body make for a chewy mouthfeel.  Finishes impeccably smooth, making this beer tremendously drinkable despite its undeniable power.

I love the intensity of character here without a terrible amount of sweetness.  It really makes this beer satisfying and drinkable.

Flavor is really odd: grapes (those big ones you have to peel, cant think of the name now) , rotten apples, saccharine, copper, water (like the flavor of water, if that makes any sense). Really odd, but not necessarily as bad as it sounds. Man, the head stays around for ever, with really nice lacing on the side. After taste is the rotten fruit and, especially, copper. Like pennies.

After opening the bottle Im hit with the strong aroma of bananas, bubblegum, and over-ripe apples. It pours a deep reddish brown with a very thick-off white head, and the aroma just gets stronger. The flavor itself didnt have as much of the banana that the aroma seemed to be promising, instead sharing the flavor with more bubblegum, ripe fruits, cloves, and a hint of anise. The finish was smooth and oily, but not so thick that it wasnt easy to drink. The rater below me hit the nail on the head... the flavor - especially the aftertaste - was extremely reminiscent of Trois Pistoles. One of my new favorite beers. Just awesome.","Markham, Ontario, CANADA","emjay"

3743,"2006-08-07",3.7,"Bottle: Extremely lively when poured. I managed to pour half a litre of 100% head to begin with, so I had to wait for that to settle before continuing. Sweet banana-bubblegum aroma, but still kind of fresh. Head is - as you might have guessed: HUGE, creamy, long-lasting and off-white in colour. Colour is dark amber and hazy. Carbonation is lively, but even though it is a very good looking beer, Ill have to deduct one point because of big chunks of sediment from the bottle. Flavour is very fruity with some alcohol sweetness and lots of warmth. Mouth feel is filling, but not quite as full-bodied as one might suspect from an 8% beer, maybe because of the huge amounts of carbonation. Although this is a very good beer I am not quite as impressed as most others. Dont know if it is because the beer is too heavy for our present very hot summer weather, of maybe the big chunks of sediment put me off...

Try this bottled, though, and you wonder what all the fuss is about -- personally, I havent touched a capped version of this for years.

Absolutely amazing taste exactly as advertised.  Hits immediately with a citrus-heavy weiss punch that goes down smooth, trailing with the spices and a strong anise aftertaste.

Smelled of a bit of raisin, vanilla, all-spice, a bit wine-like, with an ever so slightly alcohol odor. The froth had some serious hang time too. Off-white in color it complimented the clear, deep reddish orange color of the brew, which seemed kind of flat with a tiny hint of effervescense. The flavor was very spicy (Cinnamon & clove) which reminded me of Christmas time (that is Christmas night with a warming sensation radiating from the inside out as the brew travels from your tongue to your stomach.

Sweet malty smell with some alcohol present, as well as fruit (banana/apple), certainly the cloves, and yeast. Flavor is what I would imagine a dunkelweizen/barleywine/dubbel concoction to taste like. Yeasty bread, sweet caramel, some banana, apparent alcohol, raisins. Perhaps my bottle is old, but Im not getting much bitterness in the finish, which makes it seem a little less balanced than it could be. Towards the end of the bottle, the carbonation drops considerably which seemed to highlight the sweetness and further imbalance the beer.

3743,"2006-06-06",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2007 Re-rate, March 07 on draft at Ludwigs: Fine stuff, no need to add more dribble to this text. Re-rate, Feb 07, non-vintaged bottle this time: Despite being an early review from me, my first one seems to do it justice. Slight alcohol detected this time through, probably because I bought the standard bottle unaged, but it was still wonderful, super delightful, very smooth, as good as a weizenbock can get. The rating is getting bumped a bit for its within style quality (a few more weizenbocks under my belt now). Having an Aventinus Weiznestarkbier glass made the crowned fluffy head and overall appearance all the better too. An excellent beer. Original rating follows with more descript comments.... Original rating: Bottle from 2001 batch. This one exceeded all expectations. Fantastic. Pour resulted in a brown-amber colored beer with a single finger of tan head on top. The head settled, but remained as a persistent (to the last sip) thin covering on top of the beer, that actually laced ok the whole drink. The aroma was sweet, clove-like, accompanied by bananas and a light roastedness. The flavor was based on a sweet weizen base with spices (cloves) and some roasted caramel type malts detected. Not as dry as many a dunkelweizen, and certainly richer and more complex, this one was very enjoyable. Dark fruits and chocolate hide beneath it all and come out more as it warms. Lots of stuff going on here, and the alcohol is super smooth. Ill have to try a recent bottling to see how this is unaged.","","User37895"

3743,"2006-06-03",3.7,"Huge, very dense & creamy brownish head over chestnut-amber beer, very hazy with yellowish highlights and an olive shine. Very typical Weizennose: fruity-estery with banana, cloves and expressly wheat; further candi-sugar like, caramelly, malt notes, but pretty clear. Sourish-sweetish main taste, coloured by very fruity esters (oranges and banana) and a spicey, peppery flavour that is also promoting a spritzy MF. Very clearly sourish wheat taste, but also lots of malts, sweet & caramelly. All sounding very stereotypical for a Weizen, but indeed, this is very lively, characterful and very balanced. Spritzy MF, with a lot of body behind it, wheat slickness in a very pronounced way, alcoholwarming. Another Schneider classic. Strange tat the leading brewery produces also top quality.

3743,"2006-05-21",4.6,"My first review, so take with a grain of salt. This is just what my young palate was able to pick up.

Poured a dark ruby color with a beautiful off-white inch thick head.

Nose was slightly chocolate, fruity banana-like esthers. 

I drank some without the yeast, and some with:
w/out: crisp carbonation up front leading to pleasant sweetness in the middle with tons of flavor and complexity I cannot even begin to describe (maybe one day). I did pick up on the spicy clove finish that the bottle describes, and finally an alcoholic warming of the tongue.
with: raisney fruitiness giving way to yeasty flavor. Flavors similar to w/out but even more complex and pleasing.

The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth--about what I expected. 

I drank this slightly hungry just to make sure I could get it all down, but I ended up still getting quite full from this beer. Im sure experience BAs could handle it with no problem, but I got quite full and surely felt that 8.2%. Its very deceptive. Make sure you take you time with this one.

3743,"2006-05-17",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2006 It was very pleasing  to finally find a beer worth writing about here in Regensburg, Germany. Most of the poor lewdies in this town think highly of their beer, which is on the whole mediocre in quality (it should be noted that the nationalist spin is that Regensburgs Bier ist par excellence).The most sad arrangement is that they have no imports--Belgium is right next door, but the local beer owners and high-minded locals have never heard of Trappist ale (schade!). I was feeling downright sorry for the locals, especially given the strong, nationalistic propaganda about how good their beer is; after tasting the Aventinus, though, I cheered up a bit. Now  I know they arent missing out entirely (one good beer is better than none, and in this case, ignorance is far from bliss). This offering has a spicy, melon-laced aroma with solid, effervescent, well-rounded flavor--its sweet, but not cloyingly so, and the malts are balanced out.

The taste is nearly delectable with the clove flavor still being upfront with chocolate, caramel, plum, banana, and citrus flavor backing the sweetnees.  Only a touch of acidity and mild hop bitternes meet the tongue.  Palate is lively with carbonation, yet still remains somewhat creamy with a medium-full body.  Finally finishes with a sweet caramel flavor along with a slight acidity that actully is mildly refreshing(as with normal hefes).

First taste is of malty caramel but the caramel faded.  In its place was a strong banana and clove combination that was delicious.  The malt flavor remained but fell to the back.

3743,"2006-03-10",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2006 Review No. 200.  Bottled.  Muddy, murky pour.  Quite a yeasty appearance, in fact.  Head laces well, white-to-eggshell in color, and is probably the noisiest head Ive heard (despite no visible carbonation.  Light, sweetish nose, lightly spiced with caramel.  Typical Hefe flavors are subdued.  Very thick caramel taste to start, alcoholic but not offensively so.  Strong.  Dark sweet malt of a well-made bock without the stickiness, though not cloying.  Add to that the wheat of a Hefe.  Light and fruity notes in the background.  Medium body.  Fantastic Weizenbock.  My friend finds that the sweetness detracts from the complexity.  Im inclined to agree. [3.8]
Re-rate: Second bottle much the same as the first.  The noisy head really is something, isnt it?.  Conditions were slightly better this time, though the comments of the first rating hold.  Spice is coming through more earnestly this time, though, adds a disproportionally high amount of complexity to the final product.  Cheers to this major-league brew!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
3743,"2006-03-09",3.6,"From the bottle
Pours a deep reddish brown with a big foamy head. 
The aroma is strongly clove-and-flambe bananas, with a hint of booze and a hint of agar. The flavor follows suit, curiously spicy, with a bitter flourish on the roof of the mouth --- yet gentle on the tongue like warm herbal tea. 
This is clearly an outstanding beer, and yet Im not completely clicking with it. I think the fault likes in my palate and not in the craftsmanship with which this one has been produced. Itll be good to revisit under different circumstances.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Surprisingly, some tart sourness in the back, evoking cherries, grapes and cranberries.  Clove is certainly in there as well.  This is a good beer out of the bottle, but it really explodes on tap.

3743,"2006-02-27",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2006 Draught (7-4-7-3-15=3.6)  Fresh fruity nose with lots of Banana in it, later it reveals deeper spicy malt notes (not really any bock character in the nose); It has a super fresh body with some fill to it and an incredible sparkle (champagne-like); The bock character appears in a very long finish together with the classic acidity of the weizen beer. Somehow a strange beer, not typically bock neither a typically weizen.

Bottle  Brown unclear with huge white head that falls fast; Clove, banana, raisins, bock character in a quite big nose; Very well balanced body with some acidity and a huge carbonation; Exploding finish, huge, chewy because of complexity, not because it is super thick, is it long too.

When I had Aventinus on-tap at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur it had a very pronounced taste of clove and was very complex with hints of fruits and a slight banana flovor. It was listed as 9.4% ABV, but youd never know it.  I couldnt wait to get a bottle from Greens and try it again.  I did. One word, BANANA!  Thats it nothing else came through. I found Aventinus again at another place and got another bottle.  It was almost like what I had on-tap.  I think it has to do with the age of the beer.","Lithonia, Georgia, USA","rebelbrewer"

3743,"2006-02-16",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2008 Bottle. Tasted again, more than 18 months since the last time. I just thought that I should add that my first thought when smelling it this time, was a fine Belgian triple. Theres some of that thoughts when I taste it as well, and it leaves me warm inside, and very content. A really lovely weizenbock. By the way, I think I remember the Weizen Bock from Haandbryggeriet (N) to be a bit fizzy, but Im not sure anymore, as Aventinus has a quite heavy carbonation as well. Anyhow, Im really fond of Aventinus, and my rating stands unaltered. (070912)Bottled. Slightly hazy, amber beer with a thick, beige head. Heavy aroma with sweetness, toffee, cloves, dried fruits, a little banana and a hint of alcohol. It is quite fizzy in the mouth, but not as sticky as expected, and flavors of caramell, cloves, hops, alcohol, banana and dried fruits swirls around your mouth along with some yeasty notes, finishing off in a sweet, yet bitter, warming aftertaste that leaves you very satisfied.

3743,"2006-01-29",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2007 My biggest complaint about this beer is that it (the bottle)  looks cheap and like every other poorly rated european beer.  That aside its a pretty good beer.  Has a sweet malty character and a little bit of that bubblegum flavor.  Due to lack of clean glassware I drank it from the bottle but it looks great in that picture.  Alcohol is well hidden.  Cheap, too.  <$3 for 500ml

rerate.  I was too imature when i first drank this to really appreciate it.  Lately Ive been on a dunkleweizen and weizen bock kick.  I decided to revisit this.  This is awesome.  Lots of esters with a silky texture and some sweet kind of chocolately notes.  not as good as ramstein winter wheat but close.  further rerate.  i had this on tap a month or so ago, and Im drinking a bottle now.  it was phenomenal, very lush, from the bottle is totally delicious too.  when you factor everything, price, flavor, alcohol content, availability, this might be the best beer ever.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"

Overactive head, but it was fluffy and dissipated rather quickly.  Great aroma.  Banana, bubblegum, clove and chocolate all in the nose.  One of the better aromas out there.  Its a little light, and thats the only thing keeping it from a 10.  Spicy and sweet mouthfeel.  Very active carbonation in the mouth as well.  Great flavor to match the nose.

3743,"2006-01-28",5.0,"Aventinus is a dunkle weizen bockbier or ""dark wheat bock beer"" by style. It is one of the most complex and amazing beers that you will ever taste, and beer geeks world wide sing its praises. I have enjoyed this beer countless times here in the US, but to experience this one fresh vom fass at Weisses in Munich, was an almost spiritual experience. This beer is brewed with up to 60% dark wheat malt, along with a very distinctive ale yeast strain that produces estery aromas and flavors of clove, banana, and apple. Being a bockbier, this beer has strong aromas and flavors of alcohol, and packs quite a punch at over 8% abv. It was a phenomenal beer to match with my breakfast of sausages and pretzels, and one of the most amazing beers to ever pass my lips. 

Aventinus pours to a beautiful, murky and opaque, deep caramel color, with a big, tall, rocky white head, and a vibrant carbonation. . The nose on this beer is very complex, and packed with character. Aromas of sweet malt, nutty malty, clove, and aromas of ripe banana flood the nose. This is paired with peppery hints of alcohol. The palate is smooth and round on the tongue, with big sweet and caramel malt flavors, some tart wheat malt flavor, and an underpinning of estery fruit. Aventinus finishes with more complex and delicious, malt and fruit flavors, then ends with a slightly warming, malty and clove spicy finish that lingers. 

A true master piece of the brewers art, this beer fresh vom fass was a truly special beer. If that were not enough, around 10am, a lederhosen clad Ompah band walks in, sets up at a table directly behind where I was seated, and strikes up the music. The combination of the atmosphere, food, music, happy people, and of course beer, was without question one of the most, or perhaps even, the most amazing beer drinking experiences of my life. My friend, a veteran of Munich beer halls, commented to me, ""This is not done for tourists you know. Look around you. There are no tourists in here. This is what Bavarians do."". If you ever decided to venture to Germany, a trip to Weisses Brauhaus is a must, and Aventinus is a must try. I enjoyed a few liters of this beer, as well as Schneider Weisse. We had such a great time, we didnt get out of there until about Noon, and to say I left blissful, is an under statment of a life time.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

I found a clone recipe and was lucky enough to find a commercial version to try.  The head does not linger or is it long lasting as described...for this one the carbonation is locked in. Theres some fruitiness in the aroma that is beating around the bush.  You dont get a good sense for it until you take a sip.  The effervescent bubbles finally show up and the aroma comes to life.  This one is fruity and slightly tart on the tongue. I can taste cherries and other spices.  The malt flavors come through but is nicely balanced by the adjuncts.

Roll it from the front of your tongue to the back and its like a rainbow of awesomeness exploding in your mouth.

Ok try as I might I cant help but admit this is damn fine stuff. Very very good aroma. Wheaty like a white beer, full on and fruity like a dubbel and something that is almost oud brune in there too. Appearance has just been upped to a 5 now that I have noticed how uneven the line between the body and head is. Its bumpy up and down and at each of the down points there is  a little spider trail of bubbles leading down into the body. There is no doubt this is a very very good looking beer. Flavour is chunky, balanced and complex. Dark AND light fruit, clove, yeast, caramel and pudding. Damn its all over the place! Its just very very slightly too sweet if you ask me but its hard to find fault. Mouthfeel is chunky, smooth and awesome. Just glorious all round really. This one has special memories for me too. Firstly because it finished Sim off big style at GBBF once and I had to LITERALLY carry her home. Secondly because there is a guy who drinks in the wonderful Bar Fringe in Manchester and only drinks Aventinus in the right glass that he keeps behind the bar.

Smell is awesome. Lots of bavarian yeastiness going on and kicking into a hearty wheat with caramel, dark fruit, banana, clove, and a hint of chocolate and bubble gum makes this top notch.
The taste is superb, especially this draft version which makes the complex aromas and tastes seem less contained.
The mouthfeel is smooth and about medium-full bodied. All the flavors run nicely along the palate without gumming up and becoming cloying. You can keep these coming all night for me on draft.

I may fall down slobbering in a pool of drool over this beer because I like traditional doppelbocks more than wheat doppelbocks, but I still love this beer.  Sweet, strong wheat flavor, dark malts, dark fruits, banana and bubble gum, yeast, and actually a modest tartness and slight bitterness in the finish for balance and appreciated ""anti-cloying abilities"".  The nose is wheat, banana and bubble gum again, dark rich malt, molasses, some tartness, and is fairly ""doppelbock-ish"".  Full bodied, somewhat sticky and syrupy, but again, not cloying.  Fully cloudy in appearance, and the medium brown color would make a nice stain for furniture.  Tan head pours to nearly two inches in height, despite a fairly careful pour, but does eventually settle to a wide ring.  This is just a delicious beer.

I would have to say that during the pour was one of the best aromas Ive ever sensed.  I would almost buy this brew just for the aroma that is released during the pour.  On the nose was caramel and, most importantly to me, a dark fruity aspect that reminded me of a red wine.  Flavor is as good as the aroma.  I got a hint of that dark fruit that i was so impressed with on the nose.  The alcohol is noticeable, and is a nice addition to the mouthfeel in my opinion.

Dark fruits, malts, bit of spice and banana, so chocolate creeping in. Has a surprisely light mouthfeel, which was unusual yet appreciated and the high ABV is so well hidden it is quaffable (although youll want most of it to land in your mouth so it is not a true quaff).

Garnet-brown, quite clear and syrupy looking, with a thin tan head that dissipated further to leave only islands of compressed bubbles. Left a lot of lace down the glass, even with its lack of retention. Deep, exotic and rich chocolate, wheat and dark fruit nose. Bananas, peppery spice, bready yeast and alcohol add to the complex aroma that continued to waft as I downed it. Tart and ripe dark fruits in the mouth, plums and cherries, with a sweet dessert style mix of treacly fruit syrup, vanilla and ripe bananas that smooths out in the back and becomes quite dry, before finishing with a strong sweet fruity and warming swallow (sherry-like). Medium-light in body, medium-light in carbonation and quite filling in the stomach, the flavours round the mouth with gusto and make for a superb sipping beer that had a masterful balance between fruity esters and spicy phenolics.

Poured a deep, dark, murky, lively amber-brown - tons of creamy-frothy long-lasting off-white head; combined with the humidity-driven condensation, an entirely appetizing sight.  Many aroma notes - sour wine & bread doughy yeast dominated at first, then sweet malt, spices (cloves & coriander), malt vinegar and peppercorns.  Mouthfeel quite acidic, sweet and fizzy  - but it worked.  Flavour strongly of sweet malt, cloves and sourish wine, then steeped fruits - prune & raisin - noticeable alcohol, and a welcome dry hop finish at the end to keep it from being too sweet.  Overall a challenging, quenching drink - lovely to look at, smell and taste, but loses a mark for a little too much acidity.  The sourness is just right to off-set the sweetness.

I wish I could tell when this one was bottled, since its truly a ""live"" beer that matures and ripens. Anyway, however ripe this one was, it would be hard to imagine it getting any better with age.
Beautiful dark red-brown pour, with an incredible tan head that lasted well; and yet it kept a nice carbonation throughout. Rich, almost warm smells of baked figs(?) and malt.
Really an adventure in beer: all that malt and all that wheat, and hardly any hops -- just the way I like it. A kind of nutty, unsweetened cocoa; a hint of raspberry; some smoke: a ton of flavor mixed in a very smoooth nectar with an almost clove-like finish.
I loved the last bit -- followed the instructions I was given and left a couple ounces in the bottom and swirled it at the end to pick up the yeast -- what an amazing flavor that was!

3743,"2005-05-15",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2009 My total rating is from the newest of these ratings:

2006 bottle.  - Pours hazy dark amber with a big fluffy tan head. Aroma of fruity cloves, sweet spice, crazy esters that Ive never gotten from this beer: bubble gum, cotton candy, really sweet, no noticable alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied and lush, foamy carbonation makes this beer quite refreshing. Its hard to call anything perfect, but this is as close to perfect as Ive tasted. Ap 5 Ar 10 Fl 9 Pa 5 Ov 18

2004 bottle. - Pours dark and murky with a thin off-white head. Aroma is yeast and phenolic with notes of cloves, banana, toffee and a slight hint of bubble gum. Taste starts with sweet fruits and bready malt dripped in caramelized toffee, which slowly dissolves into a bouquet of flowery esters.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lush foamy carbonation.  Alcohol content is subdued but evident in the aftertaste and after completing the bottle. This brewery certainly knows how to make a good wheat beer.  If I had one desert island beer, this would be it.

2001 vintage. - Bought this bottle in honor of dortmunder. First time I have seen vintage Aventinus on sale in Atlanta.  Rest in peace friend.   This beer is presented in a white bag with purple lettering.  Pouring the brew into my weizen glass caused a violent wispy head to form, and quickly recede.  Incredible phenolic aroma of apples, nutmeg, oak, vanilla, and cloves.  Taste is sweet chewy wheat, spicy yeast, and earthy aromatic breads. This beer felt heavier than normal because most of the carbonation was initially lost during the pour.  Aged Aventinus is certainly more mellow, and in my opinion better than fresh samples.  Four years might be taking it too long though.

Taste is just outstanding, everything thats going on in the aroma but with a immencly refreshing dry bite towards the end. Alround id like to see if i could do 10 of these in one nite as its one of my favourate beers the now, a must. RERATE: Down from 4.6, the wheat charactwer is etting annoyign these days, but still an excellent beer.","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"
3743,"2005-05-05",4.1,"Apperance: Hazy brown. It poured with a big frothy head, but it quickly faded.

Aroma: Mostly the peppery/clovey phenols typical of German Hefes. A hint of some bock-like charactor. Some alcohol.

Flavor: Again with the clove. Some banana. Again typical of Hefes. Wheaty. Rasins of prunes. Alcoholic as it warms a bit.
Really good.

Palate: Quite full bodied. Velvety smooth. Fairly high carbonation. Alcohol warming near the end.

Overall: Man. If you keep these too cold, you could easily drink 2 or 3 of these monsters and end up on your face. The classic example of the style. Outstanding.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"

3743,"2005-04-30",3.3,"Bottle poured a clear mahogany with a fast, fizzy, very-light-tan head. Sustained, lively carbonation. A very one-sided, heavily toasted malt aroma with a surprising amount of alcohol. Flavor started with an unoffensive sweetness, moving to a highly malted middle and ending with a vinous sourness. Medium-bodied with a smooth, almost fruity finish. Good, but definitely not as impressive as the description makes it out to be.

Aroma first was orange citrus then a prevailing clove aroma struck my notrils.  I swirled and sniffed the top of the glass for a good 5 minutes before I realized it was clove I was smelling.  The flavor is very complex.  Many fruity notes malt wheat yeast and citrus all come out in this beer.  The palate is amazingly light for a beer of this color. The palate starts off with sweet then moves to citrus and the clove flavor leaves you wanting more it is very smooth. A tasty brew.  Im glad I gave this style a try.

Nice reddish brown color and decent head. Taste is sweet, spicy and complex but not as good as I had hoped for. I detect some raisins and licorice, vanilla and cloves. Which you might think would be reminiscent of a Christmas beer but in this case the combination does not work very well.  Also too much alcohol taste. Very much a niche beer.

The aromas are bananas foster, brown sugar, prunes, some spice, and some cleaness (avoids the malt from  getting too malty and cloying) coming from hops?, aclohol?, I dont know, but it is appreciated.

Pours a deep fuzzy mahogany with an amazingly active, noisy and abundant head, which subsides because my glass may be of questionable cleanliness.

Unlike many lighter weizen Ive come across this beer is very complex and _well balanced_. The alcohol is so well hidden it would have passed for a 3.8 or 4.0. The aroma hints of clove and rosemary (though it lacks a certain intensity present in some similar unpasteurized beers). On the palate Aventinius is simply delightful, with sour cherry cola and caramel apple notes blended in with mouthful after mouthful of natural carbonation. The hops show up if you let the beer sit in the mouth for a bit. Aftertaste is tart but also yeasty. This is a beer to savor slowly ... but plentifully.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

Color is a dark chestnut brown. This was a very lavorful beer for me, although one that I really cant quite pin down.

Runs the gamut of aromas from B to V (banana to vanilla) - banana, cloves, pineapple, caramel, treacle toffee, molasses, vanilla and probably some other s too. The flavour has more of the same, but less intense. Theres some plummy fruit and licorice here too, with just a bit of citric bite kicking in to temper the sweetness.

Can taste alcohol.  First few sips were interesting, but after the three sips, I was nearing beer heaven.  Drank this one at about 40-50 degrees, so taste was rich and right on the money.

The flavour is like all the classic German ""hefes"",bananas ,spices etc but with a nice touch of a dark chocolate,caramel background.A good alcohol taste at the end.
A well carbonated mouthfeel,but it feels good on the tongue. The finish is semi-dry, a noticable alcoholic presence in the throat..warming.,
A very well crafted beer, I liked it .But i doubt i could manage more than one 500ml in a sitting. Yet I will certainlly pick it up again.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

This came out a cloudy darker brown color with red highlights and a good-sized light tan head that rose out of the glass. Fantastic aromas rise out of this beer with dark fruits, bready malt and that yeasty wheat smell being at the forefront. There are also slight notes of smoke and chocolate. The taste starts of with slightly sweet fruits and a good amount of carbonation as well. There was a good malt flavor over the middle before a slight bit of hops and wheat come in at the end. This has a full creamy body and good carbonation. Very drinkable as well with 3 or 4 tall glasses easily going down in one sitting.

The aroma is not my favorite of all time, but still good.  It consists of malts, toffee, wheat, banana, mocha, caramel and wine.   The taste is fantastic with one of the greatest mouthfeels of all time in my opinion.  The wheat, malt, banana, caramel, toffee and wine dominate the taste.  There is a hint of milk chocolate in it as well, plus a unique sourness which is very enjoyable.  This has been a favorite of mine for several months.

3743,"2004-08-22",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2007 Bottled.  Small near-white head quickly fading into a fading ring, no lace and topping a dark, reddish amber body, hazy with some rather large solids in the bottom of the bottle, like solid, blackish flakes.  Mouth is fairly full with an incredible amount of foamy(but with larger bubbles, as would provide silky mouth if there werent so much) carbonation that is very dry and reminding me of a good belgian strong ale, very clean and crisp.  Malty mouth with fruit(banana, prune), caramel, bitter clove(mild enough to be quite pleasant; adding, not overly dominating), sour yeasts in the middle, a finish that is bitter clove, sour banana, burned wood...not oak, maybe redwood, somewhat like a cinnamon stick with much of the flavor boiled out.  Aroma last to let this warm up a bit: wonderful aroma of carmelized bananas, light, light clove, touch of vanilla; sweet and clean, reminding me of ""Dreamery Banana Split"" ice cream, which is wonderful stuff.  Aroma picks up prune and touch of alcohol with warmth.  Bock sweetens up as it warms, ever so slight taste of sweet alcohol peaks out from the clove and caramel, aftertaste becomes sweeter, picking up more caramel, touch of banana.  Pleasantly dry, not parching; lovely to drink, complex.  

10/2007
Ridiculously big head, fully lasting, with no lace, topping a chestnut body.  Lovely aroma of fruits, banana, wheat, esters, guano (yes, this stuff smells a bit like a cave, or ocean rocks frequented by seabirds), and alcohol blended throughout.  Mouth is medium-full with lots of light, foamy carbonation and a dry finish.  Becomes somewhat watery as it warms.  Flavor is fruit, fruit, fruit!  Concord grape, fresh berries (ras, cran), banana, wheat.  This stuff is a thrill to drink: its like fizzy fruit juice with some alcohol.  The alcohol blending in this is flawless.  Thoroughly enjoyed.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

There is a hint of fruitiniess, most distinctively apples.  The finish is very sweet with little bitterness, and lasts a good long time in the mouth.  There is little taste of alcohol, but it doesnt take too long for the kick to settle in.  Body is not especially full and well-carbonated.

Lacing on this sucka is great-- very nicely uniform and shimmering.  Aroma is wheaty, subtly yeasty, and with a trace character reminiscent of sweet Autumn-- auburn malts like a great doppelbock.  First taste gives a veiled heat and spiciness, yeast and thick, dark wheat.  Some of the spiced flavor of cloves to top it all.  Nice balance of sweetness and dryness.  Body is medium with moderately lively carbonation, mellow but with a hint of cloying caramel sweetness.  Very elegant mouthfeel and surprisingly drinkable all the same.

Aroma is quite spiced, some coriander and cloves, bubblegum and bananas.  Aroma is very sharp and sweet, perhaps even sour (if thats even possible in aroma?).

3743,"2004-06-07",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2004 I usually dont like wheat beers, but I really like doppelbocks.  I found this combination to be mostly good.  The head size was small and fizzy, and mostly diminished by the time I tasted it.  The beer was an orangish-brown.  The citrusy, wheat-beer-ish aroma had me dreading the taste a bit, thats why I gave the aroma lower marks.  I caught a slight nuttiness in the aroma, but that could be my nose sucking.  The taste was the best part of this beer, lightly sweet at first with plenty of that acidity I smelled, yet also with some soft and malty notes to tone it down.  At the beginning of the finish, the sweetness returned (which was nice), and then it dried out into the acid wheat-beer finish I dont particularly enjoy.  Basically, its a citrusy, understated doppelbock, and probably the best wheat-based beer I can remember having tasted.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

This brew was my longstanding favorite for months...nothing could top it. To drink one was an occasion in and of itself. Pours a seductively chocolate color. Look spritzy like any good wheat beer. Smells like...ohh my goodness...ohhh...smells like my nose is going to have kids in nine months..conception. Smells like a deep dark pit of goodness. The malts in this beer are so infinitely enjoyable I cant contain myself. Notes of raisin, plum, chocolate and a sourness to be rivasled only by my socks. Tastes lovely. Evaporates on your tongue like champagne. Has a very interesting take on the soy saltiness of most dopplebocks.

3743,"2004-04-26",4.4,"The reddish orange to burnt amber looking body surprised me with its initial clarity and the lack of cloudiness.  The second pour however had a large number of floating clumps of the little friends.  The initial head was an inch and a half in height with a fizzy carbonation.  The head did not last very long at all, and there was no lacing to speak of.  The smell was perfumey to medicinal alcohol with underlying banana, clove, and ripe cherries.  The taste was initially quite sweet with lots of fruity esters and spices typical for a German wheat beer.  The alcohol appears to be very well hidden at first, but as the beer warms up, it starts to step in front of other flavors and introduces a lot of dryness in the mix.  Towards the end of the glass, the hops make a surprisingly strong appearance.  There is a faint smokiness to the malt that is like a wispy ghost.  Mouthfeel is not as creamy as I had hoped for, and the yeast adds a mildly unpleasant metallic twang.

There is a very unpleasant metal aftertaste. Some notes of berries, grapes, caramel and fruit come out after it warms. The finish is sour and not exactly pleasant. Honestly I don't know how I feel about this beer. The taste is just a little too metallic and grapey for my liking. It is not completley unpleasant though.

3743,"2004-04-07",4.7,"50 cl bottle, served in Aventinus glass.
Appearance-wise, this is one of the most beautiful beers around, especially when served in the right glass: Deep, opaque reddish-brown; enormous, stable head that sticks around until the very end; massive carbonation visible all the way up the tall glass. It's almost - almost - a shame to drink a beer this fine-looking...
Taste is highly complex, easily combining the freshness of a wheat beer w/ the depth and fullness of taste of a doppelbock. Exemplary. Luxurious mouthfeel and very good drinkability w/ the 8% abv. being well hidden.
A unique and wonderful brew that's become one of my all-time favorites.","København, DENMARK","ToolHead"

Dark hazy brown, like mud. Quickly vanishing brown head. Floating particles. Lots of CO2. Aroma has sweetness and some alcohol. Doublebock warm palate and weizen softness. Had to rerate this because this looks like not the best possible bottle. (5/3/5/3/10)

re-rate, bottled (BB 27.05.04)
Drinked from weizen glass. Murky, hazy brown. Vanishing off-white head. Aroma is sweet, prunes, alcohol bite.

Alcoholic bitter and sour aftertaste.

Theres not much else that you need from a beer unless youre chugging a dozen in a sitting.  Luckily the LCBOs in my neighbourhood stock this fairly regularly.  Tells me that Im living in a good neighbourhood.  RE-RATED 7/26/04 - My last three bottles (bought at different times) have disappointed.  Seemed to be less flavourful and more carbonated.  Nowhere near as satisfying as in the past.  I doubt theyve changed the recipe, so maybe theyre just shipping stale bottles to Ontario.  Or, more likely, the LCBO is selling bottles that are past their prime.  In any case, just dont look forward to opening the majestic bottle like I used to.","Ontario, CANADA","Beer Snob"

Gloriously understated aromas of spice-figs and sweet malt hints of cocoa. 

Starts with a peppery, malty departure then builds on the palate and tongue to a rapturous complex mixture of spices, nuts, sweet roasty malt, citrus peel with cocoa undertones with a somehow, full...but clean,  gritty body...then the finish changes significantly to a mellow banana-clove overtone with sweet malt and some hop balance....leaving an after taste that is semi sweet and infused with a dozen different lingering spicy tastes leaving the tongue embattled....then...subtle ""warming"" from the 8%ABV...which doesn't crash down on you as it does in other strong beers that dont hide their Alcohol well.

So now I know how to tell a bad weizen, at least. So onward: This is what I was expecting. Sweet yet complex aroma and taste, beautiful caramel color. Pours a large head with big bubbles but head dissipates quicklyto be expected with high ABV beers, from my experience, and theres some fizzy carbonation left thats almost pop-like in the mouth. Fizzy-ness competes with a certain creaminess in the palate. Taste is full of wheat and yeast, as Id expect from a weizen. That said, its not as good in flavor or texture as my favorite doppelbock, the Ayinger Celebrator. If youre like me and tend to stick with barley-based beers, you might not like this. While flavorful, its definitely a weizen, which to my taste buds always kind of kill the darker malt flavors I like in a beer. On the other hand, if you like weizens, youd like this.

Clovey, dry malt flavours with a long dry alcoholic, champagne type finish.
Really bubbly in the mouth which doesn't work too well with the size of the beer. It certainly smells fantastic but the alcohol kind of clashes with the refreshing weizen character, which keeps it from getting a really high rating.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

3743,"2003-12-09",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2004 This is the first time that I've drank any kind of wheat beer much less a high quality one like this one. I am very pleasantly surprised by this beer. When you pop the cap, you get a really nice wheat smell right away. It pours nice with a decent size head on it that doesn't last very long.

The real surprise is the first sip. It not only has a tinge of wheat taste to it, but a very rich and full flavor. Its much sweeter and complete than I had expected. Several flavors show up after the first few sips including berry, carmel, and of course the wheat. At 8% ABV you can hardly notice the alcholol as it goes down very smooth but am sure will get its full force in a few minutes. Each sip gets better and better especially as it sits in the mouth. Aftertaste is decent as it lingers in the mouth, however the real joy is in the first 4 to 5 seconds as it slowly goes down the throat.

I will buy this again as it is a very smooth beer with plenty of balanced taste. Whether your a big wheat beer drinker or not, this is a must if you pass by it in the store.","Utah, USA","kbjames"

3743,"2003-12-05",4.1,"Reddish dark brown with a gem-like glow, substantially tall evenly bubbled light tan head, frothy topped and whipped with a few divets and little sparkly specks within the foam. Fades slowly to a heavy skim always present but very little lace sticking, most drips back in. Aroma is citrusy and spicy with mild lemon and orange zest mostly coming through, lighter wheat and malty sweetness, musty yeast, and clove spices engaged within. Taste is a total brigade derived from the smell, pretty sharp toned up front with a strong wheaty carbonation that grabs hold right away and sticks with ya the whole ride through. Middle strikes with a yeasty take and citrus zest of lemon and orange, carbonation finally settles out and leaves prickly notions of malted sweetness with some dark fruityness of banana and starfruit tangyness and spice that lingers with a light chewyness that smoothes it out some but that carbonation really stands out and adheres to your mouth. Quite a ride in the feel dept., lots of hold and carbonation that creates lots of those little burps at first but as it warms it mellows and becomes more gratifying. A pretty nice brew, seemingly one dimension in a way, but complex enough to keep interest and finding something new nearly every sip makes for a welcome experience and favorable enjoyment.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Flavor matches, and there is some gentle fruitiness present in the malts as well.  My original rating of 8,4,7,2,16 was the result of my issues with the bock style and the associated sweetness.

3743,"2003-07-16",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2007 2003 bottle consumed 2003I say this very little, in fact, this may be the first time I am saying this:  
OVERRATED.

Smells of clove and yeast.  Not terribly sweet/almost slightly crips aroma.  Mountain of off-white head, that lasts. The picture on the left isnt exaggerating.  Muddled brown with some dirt colored browns and grays and of course a little gold peeking through.  Completely clouded over by the sentiment.
This beer was challenging from the start.  Very sharp spicey tones attack the palette.  The carbonation is already too much from the outset.  It settles a bit in the middle and a full, if somewhat wet, body arises.  The clove and banana are in full effect, and I certainly detect bubble gum esters. There is some caramel malt present but it is small and watery. They should do like Spaten and add some roasted malt.  Alcohol is quite present and lingers long on the finish, with a slow, sweet burn.  As the carbonation dies away (somewhat, and after a long while) I am able to detect the chocolate it talks about on the label, yet it is hardly perceptible.  This beer is mostly banana and clove and is too unbalanced (complexity is masked by too much banana/clove/bubble gum sweetness).  I enjoyed the finish and aftertaste the most (probably due to the lack of the carbonation).  There was a complex mix of wheat, yeast and malt.  However, beers need to be more than a pleasant aftertaste.  This one needs some work.  Would benefit from cellaring, and eating a hearty meal while drinking it.  2000 wrapped bottle. consumed Jan 03.

The mouthfeel instantly gives a hint of the ABV. This is not a heavily hopped beer but is nevertheless balances well with the malt. A touch of wheat character in the finish with some spicy overtones. The only problem was the lack of head all the way down. RE-RATE: When a perfect specimen is found it really has an edge over many other beers.

3743,"2003-05-07",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2004 20% light nut colored frothy head on top of a dark tea-colored body.  Couldnt really grasp too much in the aroma, I guess you can say it had some clove.  Palate was quite light and a fair amount of carbonation.  First impression was not very good, but it grew on me.  Not as complex as I had imagined, yet it is a wheat doppel...there was some noticeable ethanol in the finish.  A pretty good beer.  -------- was my 59th beer rated and my 4th that has an overall rating of greater than 4, so I figured I'd re-rate now that my palate is more mature.  Aroma is largely banana and clove-like.  Pours a murky slightly browner than apple cider color with a fizzy light tan head.  Lots of wheat in this beer, bananas and cloves in the middle.  Some sweetness too.  A little alcohol burn at the end.  Bitter finish.  I would say that my original rating is probably right on the money for this one.  I may have decreased a point in appearance.  Solid, but a bit overrated IMO.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Reminds me more of some of the yeastier belgian styles than it does an ordinary German wheat. Strongly spicy aroma--loaded with cloves with some fruity yeast esters as well. Full, round body. Creamy carbonation. Has a sharp, slightly tart bite up front. Sweetens as the beer progresses. Toffee, caramel, cloves, and brown sugar come to the fore. A warming alcohol presence helps hold things together. Short, slightly sweet, slightly hoppy finish. Leaves a bit of sticky residue on the tongue. Easily my favorite wheat beer I have tried to date.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The body contained some yeast residue floating in it. It's taste leaves a lasting impression on your tongue as it goes down. It has a very nice taste with a hint of raisin and at the top of my list, but not the very top. After a few drinks, the alcohol content really comes through. 

Re-Rate 1/31/2003 was 8-4-8-4-16 this rating 7-5-8-5-17 bumped palate up to compenate.  This bottle was aged 3 years prior to opening by the manufacturer.  It came in a specially wrapped paper wrapped to distinguish it from the unaged brews.  The wrapper had Aventinus brewed in 1999 on it in purple letters with a light yellow background.  It poured a very large head of mostly diminishing light brown colroed finely sized bubbles.  The body was very carbonated transparent and dark brown in color.

3743,"2003-02-24",3.3,"I still cannot believe this is rated at 4.1, but what confounds me even more is the ratebeerian communities love for anything so much as resembles a port wine as this does in taste. It pours a ruby red but it a fiery cloudy reddish mess in the light with a white fluffy head which dies off very quickly....even more so than i would have imagined. The aroma has some of the strangest stuff i could possibly pick up....everything from malt, to candy and sugar, to wheat, to, i swear i smelled this...vitamins!!! It smelled like vitamins!! The taste was just as complex and weird. There is a massive plummy deep fruit taste. Very strong port wine qualities with a grape-like sourness coming through. On the other hand, there are instances where it begins to taste like a wicked dose of cough medicine..just nasty. The carbonation level is medium to slightly prickly with a definite resiny mouthfeel. Not bad...but once again..far too port winish for my tastes...just strange.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Pours out to a plum darkness in the glass with a light brown head that reminds you of brown sugar.  The aroma is that of fruit.  The taste.  Man, the taste.  Where to begin?  Initially, there is a presence of nutmeg, cloves and banana, much like a regular wheat beer.  But just when you think this is what you get, the beer transforms as it warms and the clove/banana taste leaves and a warm fruit taste of  raisons takes over.  A wonderful beer that truly hides the 8% ABV very well.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","proc"

Dark brown coloured body with violet and crimson hues toward the bottom. Frothy off-white head that dies down quickly, but you have to expect that with a 5 year old bottle.

Aftertaste lingers, but fades off unusually quickly. Overall, this beer is a great doppelbock, but after 5 years, lost its touch...I wouldnt give this bottle so long next time.

Sweet sticky finish covers the alcohol very well.  This seems to have picked up some more complexity over the past 4 years, but nothing too different from its fresh version.

Original Rating: Dark brown with a huge puffy head (see picture).  Smells like a really malty wheat beer with the typical banana and clove character.  The body is full and a touch spicy with a mellow bittering finish.  It warms the inside as it goes down, although the alcohol is masked well in the flavor.  I love the yeast as well.

3743,"2002-10-28",2.8,"Initially impressed. Im not a fan of wheat beers or lagers (even dark ones), but this has loads of flavours bundled together in an attractively spicy package. The dark lagers (Bocks & Viennas) are more complex and flavoursome than Pilsner type lagers, though they seem to fall into the same trap as rose wine - being neither flesh, fish nor good red herring. This Aventinus, however, seems to pack quite a punch. There is, however, quite a lot going on for a thin bodied beer - too much for a simple refreshment which is what most thin bodied beers are good for. An interesting taste to accompany the lager is very pleasing, like a well strummed acoustic guitar, but a 32 piece jazz orchestra is a little too much. As I continued to drink I found that the orchestra was a little too intrusive, that there was not enough sweet malt body to comfort my increasingly tortured palate. The medicinal tastes began to overpower, and I started to feel I was in a hospital undergoing open throat surgery without enough anaesthetic.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

3743,"2002-08-20",4.3,"Is this an ale or a lager? Its fruitiness suggests this is an ale, an ultrastrong hefe-weiss dunkel.

I expected a full-bodied doppelbock malting, but a received a clean dose of wheaty ebullience instead--with a hint of woodiness in the atmosphere as well.  Wheat is again the predominant character in taste though enough malt underneath stanches the appearance of any bitterness. Eventually, the alcohol breaks through in both aroma and taste.  Overall, this is a great beer with good balance and the alcohol masked superbly.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

I was hit by a warm bread pudding, which is to say, nothing as simple or trite as raisins but a full panoply of such flavors, including nutmeg, raisins, cinnamon, apple cider, plus a caramel sauce and a little banana in the bread.  Nice hazy brown color reminds me of the same kind of toffee syrup, only the sweetness is balanced.  Some liquor-like flavors in the tasting, with a more wheat and yeast influenced finish.  Perhaps some clove coming out more in the taste.  Alcohol, like the sweetness, is understated.  While likeable, I wouldnt call this an easy-drinking beer--sometimes rather challenging.

I am not crazy about this style, but I admire this brew for what it offers.  I didn't note the wheat character as it seems a little overwhelmed by other malts -- there must be numerous crystal malts to build this kind of character.

Too syrupy sweet for my tastes, and these recent bottles (with the new ""Tap 6"" design) seem sweeter and more caramel-sugar heavy in the nose than I remember too.

Pours a deep amber orange with a nice head of off white bubbles. Aromas of malt, clove, and soft banana. Clean malty slight-citrus flavor hits the tongue with a perfect amount of carbonation before giving way to caramel, banana, apricot, and hard candy. Then a clove like hop finish before going away leaving the palate awake and wanting more. World Class!","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","Fantomasus"

3743,"2000-06-25",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2003 Dark reddish-brown, hazy, with big frothy head.  Luscious dark fruit aroma - banana, apple crumble, sweet malts, milk chocolate.  Most surprisingly is the hint of burning cedar - I've never picked that phenol out in Aventinus before (but then I haven't evaluated Aventinus in a while either); smooth dark malt palate...dark malts, sweet banana esters, liberal mix of alcohol.  Complex, stylish, and daring.  A great weizenbock.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Very cloudy brownish, with foaming large beige head, fading surprisingly rapidly.   Banana and caramel are the first to be known in the nose, followed by mild phenols.  Flavor is strongly sweet with true weizen flavors of banana, mild clove to give complexity.  Mild melanoidin malts are present but are tempered by the phenols.  Finish is light, refreshing, semi-dry, zesty, almost minty.  A truly outstanding accomplishment in a beer so strong.  Mild alcohol presence does come through, especially as the beer warms, but it's also amazing that a beer of this strength can retain its complexity and drinkability at cooler temps.  Also amazing that this beer ages so well - it could perhaps survive a year or two more.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
