Alkohol: 7,1% obj. 
Kolor : Czarny . Nieprzejrzysty. Delikatne rubinowe refleksy u podstawy piany. 
Piana: Ciemno beżowa z lekkimi rubinowymi refleksami. Czapowata, bardzo zwarta i intensywna jak wata cukrowa. Tworzy liczne drobne pęcherzyki. Bardzo długo się utrzymuje. 
Zapach: Aromatyczna kawa z odrobiną mleka. Karmel. Vanillia. Gorzka czekolada. Dymione nuty w tle.
Minimalne torfowe i popiołowe aromaty również wyczuwalne. 
Smak: Dokładnie to samo co w zapachu. Prócz tego jeżyny., lekkie rumowe nuty, kakao, karmel. Wyraźna paloność. Goryczka jest umiarkowana i bardzo stonowana.
Alkohol przyjemnie rozgrzewa, ale nie wychodzi na wierzch. 
Wysycenie: Niskie. 
Podsumowanie:  
Świetny stout. Dokładnie pomiędzy klasycznym stoutem, a RIS-em. Jest bardzo dobrze zbalansowany. Pomimo że jest wytrawny pije się go lekko i przyjemnie. Alkohol mimo wysokiego woltażu praktycznie niewyczuwalny.
Cholernie smaczny!","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

I had the 10.1% Imperial Brown Stout London 1856 which was excellent so I am eager to try this bottle I picked up in London.

It pours a deep black with a thick rusty tan head of foam. The aroma is rich savoury chocolate and toasted oats. It may even have hints of marshmallow?

Full bodied with a silky smooth texture, this is hardcore.

The taste is darkly bitter roastiness, oats, dark chocolate, dried fruits, some espresso dark dark dark coffee notes.

Whatever, work, who cares. Need beer. Must tick. Get back on that horse, dude, and down some shot glass sized pours of the rare stuff. England is inspiring, home of Mick the Tick and many other legends. Holy schnikeys this one is intense. 2oz is really all you need, even if youre not a ticker (but really, who isnt these days)? It is black as all hell and you know its going to hurt you. Aroma is fairly understated and does not prepare you for the flavor blast. Roast, anise, candied plum. The flavor takes a second to hit you but then blasts the living crap out of your taste buds. Cadbury Fruit & Nut bars come to mind, amped up 50x and joined by an onslaught of vanilla, anise, tobacco, and all kinds of crazy stuff. Thick, intensely full and smooth mouthfeel. Soft carbonation.

It pours pitch black and has only a fine layer of tannish foam. Served cold so that could explain the lack of foam. Which I tend to agree with seeing the fine lacing a cold bottle leaves behind.

Whoa, the nose isnt lacking. Big aromas of coffee and dark chocolate with *something* fruity in there. Maybe the tasting will reveal that fruitiness.

Oh yes, the coffee and chocolate are big and bold and up front and bring a strong bitterness. Im not having much luck identifying any fruit character but theres something there that kind of reminds me of The Abyss. Totally different brew in most ways, mind you, but there *is* something. Very very dry due to the almost extreme bitter factor. 

Hehe///settling in with this rather big bad boy now. The coffee and chocolate bitter bites never seem to cease. Hey now. I just got an inkling of something sweet, just before the finish. Te very next sip and I dont get that at all. Weird tastings going on but Export Stout is tickling my fancy.

1933,"2012-04-10",4.0,"0.33l bottle from beermerchants.com The pour on this one is damn near black. Some dark brown traces around the edges, but other than that, this is classified as a black beer. It also has a small quickly sidesticking tan head. Hard to describe the aroma on this one. Its actually kinda old - like in a old mans couch, only in a good way. Its of course strong and powerful with heavy roasted - almost burned malts, it has a ashy touch, I also find traces of both cardboard and cereal box - like after the cereals are gone. Sounds really strange, but I like it. When tasting it its really one of those beers that just glides down the throat way to fast, and when its gone some seconds you get this great roasted - almost burned and lots of dark bitter Belgian chocolate in the finish and aftertaste. Theres also traces of cold coffee, and it has a mild subtle acidity from the roasted malts. Yeah, I like this! 22.03.2012","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

1933,"2011-02-05",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2015 330ml bottle (Utobeer, London)
6+ Very rich roasty aroma, touch of chocolate. Anna thought she got some banana (poured without any sediment, for reference).
5- Beautiful black body, tight tan head.
7 Moderately full roasty taste, some sour stale coffee notes, and a good dry bitterness too. But perhaps a little sludgy and cocoa-powdery.
4 Full smooth rich palate, not slick, carbonation low. Slightly chocolatey finish, some nice bitter hops too. Doesnt completely cover the alcohol, but it doesnt exactly feel strong either.
13 I liked it more than Anna, who would have given it a little bit less everywhere. She should get her own account. If they could rein in the cocoa-powder sludginess, I think it would be great.
Rerate: 330ml bottle (6-:4:6:4:13=3.3-) - shared by vastaktiv and rosenberg - thanks!
Do I get an enteric component to the aroma? simple roast in aroma. fairly simple everywhere, in fact. just a roasty brew, not really with any highlights.
Rerate: 330ml bottle (Pudel, Tallinn) (8-:4:7+:4:15-=3.8-)

1933,"2010-10-18",4.0,"[330ml bottle, Kernel Brewery, London] Much darker pour than the London porter  as youd expect  thick, treacle-like consistency. Touch of coffee on the aroma, but mostly heavy bitter alcohol and stewed fruit. An exceptionally well-crafted strong stout  bitter coffee with a warming alcohol aftertaste and more bitterness on the finish. However, it never oversteps the mark  its not too bitter at the end, its not too punchy with the alcohol, and the smooth sweetness yields just at the right time.

1933,"2010-10-15",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2015 Bottle at the London Brewers Showcase. Pours opaque brown with a strong, tan head. Holds a sharp malt aroma with some roast and dark cocoa. Lightly sweet with some unique flavors and notes of earth, tobacco, licorice and some chocolate. Medium to full in body with average carbonation and light warmth. Finishes with lingering roast and some nice bitterness. (September 2010, score: 3.8)Bottle at home in London - picked up at the brewery. Pours rich black with a dense, frothy mocha head. The aroma is rife with burnt, ashy roast, dark chocolate and dark berries and cherries. Medium sweet flavor with pleasant sticky burnt sugars, some dry charcoal, strong roast and bittersweet dark chocolate, bitter scorched earth. Medium to full bodied with massaging carbonation and velvety texture. Robust but still exceedingly well balanced in the finish, with overarching and lingering baking cocoa, some more liquid chocolate elements, scorched earth, dried dark fruits, some burnt marshmallows.

1933,"2010-10-10",3.4,"Pours black as squid ink with only the very edges finding any colour.  The head is medium tan with a layer of creamy white on top - I love these two tier heads.  The lacing is lasting and easily reinvigorated.  The nose is of roasted malts, aged hops, dark chocolate and fortified red wine.  The mouth brings a orange edge to the chocolate.  Then come coffee, leather, tobacco and a mild yeast presence.  It finishes on the roasted characters, with the hops growing progressively bitter towards its final dry end.  A well done stout and highly enjoyable.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"
1933,"2010-10-07",3.7,"330 ml bottle at home: pours black with tall somewhat tight tan head. Fades to a thick film. Roast barley, toast and a good underlying malt nose. Green herbal notes come up as the beer sits. Sweet alcohol and a touch of toffee mix with a light mixed nut aroma. In the mouth you first get green herbal hops and then the roast. Roast goes nice and deep but not astringent. Sweet alcohol comes in with a touch of treacle. At first I actually think there is too much hop but the extra hop comes in handy as you get further into the beer. Medium body which ends just dry enough to be very drinkable.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"
