4396,"2017-01-13",3.9,"Pours a dark red/brown color. About two fingers tan colored head. Not a long lasting head, but retention is not real good, but lacing is good.Aroma is a heavy in dark roasted malt. Chocolate, coffee, brown sugar. Toasted bread crust. Smoke.I taste the smoke first. Smoke, a little char. Malty, sweet. Almost too sweet. Theres a touch of bitter at the very end. Theres as lot of chocolate and coffee in this, its close to being a porter.Mouthfeel is medium light bodied. It is slightly dry. A little chewy. Slightly bitter at the finish. It could use a touch more carbonation, but it is extreme!y drinkable.Overall, this is really good. Its for sure one Id want to get again.","Arkansas, USA","beer_rookie"

4396,"2017-01-03",3.6,"Can.
Pours clear dark mahogany with an average light mocha colored head.
The aroma is nutty, malty, sweet and toasty.
The flavor is nutty with almost a smoky touch delivered over a light roast malt bitterness ending in a dry finish.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
4396,"2016-12-26",3.9,"Can. Love dark lagers. Clear, very dark brown. Aroma had loads of dark roasted grains. Taste also dark roasted grains with a coffee bitterness.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","tnkw01"
4396,"2016-12-22",3.4,"Pours a very dark mildy reddish brown color with the perfect off cream head. Aroma is smoke, tons of roasted malt, and just the slightest very bitter and not sweet at all chocolate. Taste is roasted malt all the way, smoke note is noticeably missing for it to be a schwarzbier, more just like a roasted malt beer. Not saying its bad, I enjoy this greatly in the winter, but not according to the style at all, more like a typical session stout or porter. There is a pleasant bitterness at the end, like eating 100% dark cacao chocolate bars and very dry. Overall not a bad beer, just misnamed for the category.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","BadAprilia1000"
4396,"2016-12-05",2.7,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2016 Pours a pretty brown hue, but the nose mostly keeps to itself. Starts with a bitter burst of hops, then rolls into a roasted center with the slightest of apple-tinted lager notes. Finishes with a mocha vibe piggybacked by aspirin-like hoppy fade. Thin feel, weak taste, made out of whack by the bitterness. Not overbearing, just a bit much for such an easygoing beer.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
4396,"2016-11-21",2.9,"355ml can. Pours a dark brown, light tan head, looks nice. The beer is a decidedly american take on a scwarzbier. Almost stoutlike, it does not have the delicate flavor of a schwarz, its a mouthful of roasted malt every sip.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
4396,"2016-11-17",4.1,"Starless has a very thick, beige head, a dark brown, bubbly, appearance, with heavy lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is of sweet, strong bread crust (toast, really). Taste is of sweet, toast crust, a touch of char, milk, cream, and low level bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, and Starless finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT","Laplace, Louisiana, USA","ronaldtheriot"
4396,"2015-05-04",3.2,"Sampled at Brewhibition. Black, as you might expect. No head. Smells like coffee, with a hint of licorice and toast. Clean, crisp palate. Flavor is coffee and burnt toast.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
4396,"2015-03-23",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 17, 2015 Couple of pints on tap. Schwarz but unclouded with a creamy thin layer of foam. Mild nose of dark chocolate, roasty grain and coffee. Tastes of the same but more of it. Also has some sour cream and dry cocoa notes. Medium body is smooth with medium carbonation and lightly astringent with the acidic roast drying finish. Pretty nice sessioner.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
4396,"2015-03-15",3.7,"Black pour with a thick light cream head. Chocolate, roasted malts, light coffee and chewy. Smooth palate, heavy roasted malts, chocolate coffee, clean finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
