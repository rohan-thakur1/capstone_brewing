2393,"2004-12-16",3.9,"This is a great hoppy brew, a bit too hoppy for an amber. Pours a slightly cloudy copper with a tall smooth white head. Lots of citrus hops, slightly spicy with just a bit of maltiness in the aroma. Taste starts with just a quick malt hint then finishes with a great citrus hop dry finish. The dryhopping really allows this brew to be refreshingly hoppy without being overly bitter. A great brew for some easy drinkin.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"

Fresh hoppy flavor with some slightly toasty malt and caramel flavors balancing it out. Flavor is primarily hops though. Very tasty and hoppy rendition of a  Red Ale, could possibly even be considered and American Strong Ale.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","frylock"
