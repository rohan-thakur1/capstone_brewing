Lots of maple syrup in the aroma, roasted malts, coffee, more coffee, dark sugars and some vanilla. Its full-bodied, sticky-sweet, lightly warming, smooth and with a low level of carbonation. Sort of oily. Roasted malts, maple syrup, coffee, dark sugars, hints of vanilla and coconut and a pleasant bitterness to deal with at least some of the sweetness in the flavor. Lasting finish with shitloads of maple syrup. Sure not a beer to drink a lot of if you want to avoid diabetes, but its damn tasteful. 170604","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

1471,"2017-05-20",4.3,"Kolor:  Nieprzejrzyście czarny, trochę za ciemny jak na portera. 
 Piana:  Całkowity brak piany. Zerowe wysycenie. Przez sekundę pojawił się milimetrowy krążek, który zaraz zniknął w ciemnych czeluściach trunku. 
 Zapach:  Pierwszy niuch i ponownie jestem na tropikalnej wyspie. Poprzednim razem znalazłem się tam degustując Anagram z Omnipollo.
Tym razem aromat jest totalnie zdominowany przez syrop klonowy. 
Pachnie intensywnie aż przypominają mi się amerykańskie pancakes;) Pod spodem mamy nuty wanilii, świeżo startego kokosa i odrobina czekolady mlecznej.
Uwielbiam ten aromat. Wypełnia całe pomieszczenie i unosi się wysoko ponad butelką. 
 Smak:  W smaku całkowity brak nut palonych, więc jest jak najbardziej charakter Porterowy. 
Potężna porcja syropu klonowego.
Na przeciwległym biegunie nuty kokosa i wanilii.
Nie są one już tak jednoznaczne jak w aromacie.
Daleko na szarym końcu mleczna czekolada, karmel i dość sporo kakao.
Goryczka jest niska, zerowe wysycenie. Alkohol gładki, ładnie ukryty. Tekstura umiarkowana.
Bardzo fajny trunek. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  <br//

Ciekawy Imperial Porter nafaszerowany syropem klonowym, wanilią i kokosem.
Pachnie obłędnie, jak większość mocnych piw z Omnipollo.
Smak nie podąża aż tak bardzo za aromatem. Nie można mu natomiast niczego złego zarzucić. Trunek jest warty polecenia dla wszystkich kochających sztuczne aromaty ;)","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

1471,"2017-03-14",4.3,"Az Omnipollo sörei messzi földön híresek az elrugaszkodott, már az elnevezés alapján is gasztronómiai kalandtúrának ható ízvilágukról, a Lorelei sem lóg ki túlságosan a sorból a maga kókuszos, juharos vonalaival. Illatra egyszerűen fenomenális, tömény kókuszkrém karamellel átszőve, csokoládé -, és juharszirupos jegyekkel bőségesen meglocsolva. Mennyei, csemegeszerű aromák, folyékony desszertek krémes felhőcskéi. Az ízvilág ehhez képest némileg élesíti a képet, sűrű, apró szemű szénsavháló hegyezi ki kissé az ízjegyeket. A mannaszerű hatás természetesen nem marad abba, csupán a szirupos, olajos szerkezetet érezzük enyhén megszellőztetettnek, kikönnyítettnek ezáltal. A csokoládé bársonyos eleganciája, a juharszirup fás, fűszeres pikantériája, s a kókusz vaníliával kevert krémessége itt is jelen van, izgalmas teltségével egyszerűen nem lehet betelni, a medvecukros, komlós kesernyével átitatott végjáték pedig hosszú perceken át gondoskodik a főzet utóéletéről is. Soha nem lepleztem gyengéd érzelmeimet a vattacukor fokozatúra hangolt édességű imperial stoutok iránt, amit ha példával kellene alátámasztanom, valószínűleg ez a sör is eszembe jutna. Esetében azonban némileg árnyaltabb a kép, ami nem kis mértékben a szögletes élekkel rendelkező, a gyermekien játékos stílust végül markánssá hangoló, néhol száraz, néhol füstös, máshol karcos és vadóc, az összbenyomásokat színesítő, más szemszögből nézve azok értékét kicsit talán még le is rontó utóízének köszönhető. Mindezzel együtt természetesen köröket ver nagyon sok (a legtöbb?) imperial stoutra.","HUNGARY","adster"

Taste is peanut icecream, vanilla, mixed nuts with maple syrup coating, yeasty with a spicy metallic finish. Rich. I can see what people like about it but I find it a bit crazy. Reminds me a bit of Buxtons Yellow Belly, which is another beer I struggle with a bit. Not sure how much of this I could drink. If you like big sweet flavours, this is a must.

I really have a very low tolerance for the stuff in most beverages, finding it to massively dominate when not used very carefully. Here its quite light in the nose and theres plenty of enjoyable burnt and vinous character that really balances the cocoa and caramel fudge-like maltiness nicely.Same in the mouth, though its exceedingly rich, the oily, burnt notes and light coconut help balance all of this malt. Coffee, caramel, char and prunes with low carbonation (but ample). Coconut, caramel, char and dark fruits linger. Alcohol pretty strong here and as the stuff warms and breathes, it gets pretty challenging due to all of the sugar/syrup character.
