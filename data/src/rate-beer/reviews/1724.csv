1724,"2015-06-30",2.4,"(bomber) Had this on tap awhile back and was quite impressed, and seeing this now available in MN, I was tempted to pick it up. I regret this decision. Pours a hazy golden color with a quickly dissipating white head. Aside from the quickly dissipating white head, this certainly looks the part. The aroma is where all things go south quickly, with competing scents of bubble gum, lemon peel, pine, caramel corn, and lemon pledge (the peel turns more artificial with warming). It smells like a cross between a bad belgian blonde ale and a middling IPA. Flavor holds little kicks of bubblegum, banana, tart wheat towards the finish,a mineral component, with little stinging stabs of hops closer towards the end of the finish. Theres a bit of cereal in here too, but I cant tell whether its more like Kix or more like Capt Crunch. Mouthfeel is nice. Im not sure if they changed their recipe since I had this awhile back, but this is nothing like the beer I had on tap a few years ago. I shouldve read the description before buying as it states that this is a departure from the traditional hefeweizen, and having read that I wouldve likely put it back on the shelf.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

1724,"2014-08-10",3.8,"22 ounce bottle - $4.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Lightly clouded with a light hue of burnished gold. Smallish, white a head, a little fizzy. A few streams of active carbonation.

Smell: Subtly wheaty aroma, some grain, yeasty dough. Light clove bud, lemon peel, banana.

Taste: A taste of wheat with a doughy backdrop to it and a small, soft sugary element. The juice of one lemon with a little snap of acidity. Transient hints of clove, nana, and plain gum. Modestly hopped, a little herb and a low bitterness. Minor alcohol component. Wheaty and a bit spicy on the nicely drying, fairly effervescent finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-plus carbonation. A small appreciable amount of heft from the malts, but doesnt approach the creamiest of the style.

1724,"2014-08-06",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 9-22-12-
 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance Served a hazy golden yellow colored brew with a one finger white head. The head had a pretty good retention and eventually faded to leave some nice lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell - The aroma was biggest of a biscuit and yeasty smell. Mixed with these aromas were some lighter notes of pepper, citrus, and some herbal hops. Rather standard in many respects for a weiss.

 Taste  The taste begins with a biscuit and sweeter citrus fruit flavor. A yeast cake flavor 
quickly comes to the tongue. Soon after a banana and pepper flavor follow the yeast, bringing a more classic Weiss flavor to the brew. More toward the end of the taste a lemon citrus surges a bit and when combined with some flavors of a light grapefruit hop bring a yeasty, biscuity citrus flavor to the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the beer was on the slightly thicker side for a weiss with a carbonation level that was very average. 

 Overall  Not bad. A pretty nice weiss with a bit more flavor and a better feel then most.","","Darkmagus82"

Taste: Crisp wheat intro with a mild lemon mid-taste. The finish adds clove, a bit out of balance but not bad. Definitely a crisp and refreshing beer for the Summer.
Palate: Light and crisp with a slight creaminess to it.

Sample number two was a short one thanks to that filling imperial stout (and generous pour). If I had been stuck with this though I would not have complained too badly. After all it was a lighter style which was perfect for the summer months. Had I been outside on the patio this would have been a great choice.

Aroma and appearance - The shimmering white bubbly head was a perfect decoration for the sparkling gold body. Lemons splash across the nose along with the smell of a dusty oak end table. Latent esters awake over time.

Flavor and palate - Lemons, melons, and a number of other summer fruits brighten up the palate. White bread toasted to perfection tickles the throat before a sweet finish. Glowing it positively radiates summer as it hits the palate with its full force.

Its got some heft from the carbonation, but its not too carbonated.  Taste is very sweet... too sweet.  Plenty of yeast, fruit, bread, crackers and a little bit of apple.

Pours a very hazy golden yellow banana color with golden yellow hues when held to a light and a half finger white head that quickly fades into a lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing left behind.

Slightly earthy, tart aroma with lots of zesty spice as well as some bready yeast and crisp citrus fruit. Hints of coriander, pepper, banana and lemon peel. The nose is pretty complex with lots of different characteristics bouncing off of one another. Nice and spicy but still has plenty of light, crisp citrus and yeast character.

Full bodied and very flavorful with an excellent balance of bread/yeast, citrus, light fruit and spice. The spice isnt overpowering with subtle pepper and coriander that compliments the citrus lemon peel and light banana flavor very nicely. The ABV of this beer isnt very high but it is well asked with little alcohol flavor, making this tasty beer extremely quaffable. Prominent banana and flavor which is a nice change for the style with the perfect spice, bread and citrus compliment.

Lacking a bit in freshness  from the tap at Firewaters, Atlantic City, NJ and they have 50 draught offerings for a crowd that you would never suspect has ever heard of craft beer. The lemon wedge my beer was served with seemed to fit the environment. Beer is beer. Corona is beer and served with a lemon wedge, therefore all beers shall be served with a lemon wedge. Not rocket science. All that said, the royal weisse was cerealic and grainy, its malt profile was chewy and with more barley than actual wheat flavours. It manages to stay refreshing, but is a bit thick to do it well.

1724,"2006-01-12",4.0,"Just returned from the brewery, and this was the surprise of the night.  A traditional german wiess with belgian tripel yeast - wow!  Floral aroma that is beyond anything youd expect in the style.  Flavor and body are fuller than expected, with clearly an ample malt level.  A little spice appears on the end.  One of the brewers (John) laughed as I correctly guessed the yeast came from Golden Monkey.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"

1724,"2005-02-13",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2007 First thing you notice is a cloudy apricot color, topped with a small white head.  Flavor was distinct and refreshing, banana and melon, typical wheat beer fruit, combined with an unbelievable clove spice bite.  Great full mouth feel.  Good spice and hop finish.  I would love to see this in the summer as a barbeque beer.  // Liked the draft even better this time.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"

1724,"2004-08-08",3.9,"Slightly hazy, golden appearance.  Aroma was pretty true to style: fruity, yeasty, spicy.  Taste followed the same script, with notes of bubblegum, cloves, banana, pepper and vanilla.  After a few sips,  the previously undetected hops decided to make more of a statement;  they did not try to dominate, just added a bit of balance.  Pleasant, lasting finish.","Hanover, Maryland, USA","guzzler67"
1724,"2004-08-06",3.1,"Very heavy nose, almost sweet and nearly off-putting.  Nice hazy unfiltered look in the glass.  Taste is of sugar and wheat with a hint of alcohol (thankfully).

Nice.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"

1724,"2004-07-15",3.9,"Citrusy and yeasty nose - no surprise there.  Flavor is sweeter than I expected, but not overly sweet.  A nice change.  That sweetness holds some nice citrus and yeast, and a but of alcohol.  The finish is sweet and lemony with a little spice.  The body on this is great.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
1724,"2004-07-12",3.7,"Overall very similar to sunrise wheat.  Somewhat cloudy yellow/straw color with moderate white head and small lacing.

1724,"2004-07-02",4.3,"Draft: Bleached canary yellow body. Thin, silky layer of dusty-white bubbles.  Peppery yeast, herbal hop aroma laced with mild notes of clove, perfume, banana, melon, soft dough, mandarin orange, mint, and honey. Soft body with a light spritz. Fresh clove flavors pounce the palate and are trailed by dough and juicy noble hops. Firm phenols in the background and soft layers of citrus. Lovely blend of lightly toasted pale malt and juicy melon. Clove and minty herbs numb the palate. Finishes appetizingly dry, which enhances the herbs and intensifies the clove, yet robustly full, with notes of flowers. Citrusy aftertaste cushions the dryness. Among the best Hefes in the states, hands down.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1724,"2004-06-05",3.8,"Lightly cloudy pale yellow with good head with light lacing. It could probably stand to be cloudier. Theres more clove than banana on the nose, but the banana comes out more in the flavor. A good dry wheat backbone backs the yeast flavors up nicely.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

I cant get into this clove flavor. I just dont like this style. 5/5/06: Ive changed my way with this hefe. Very clean and refreshing although a bit thin on the palate.

1724,"2003-09-03",3.6,"I had this side-by-side with the Paulaner Hefeweizen, and while I liked this beer, I found it difficult to understand.  Thin, clinging head on a hazy, yellowish body.  Sweet, cloyinging so, with everything leading me to write ""big"" in my notes--banana and bubblegum, coming on more as it warms.  Interesting and a slightly different interpretation within the style.  I wouldn't rave about it, though it does have its attractions.

Sweet, thick maltiness and a light refreshing tartness is accented by a nice yeastiness and touches of citrus.  Complex and a winner in my books.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
1724,"2003-04-29",3.4,"Has the appearance of murky, upstate New York apple cider. Small, quickly dissipating, creamy white head. No lacing.
The nose holds notes of grapefruit peel, banana, original flavor bubble gum and black pepper.
The flavor is malty and citrusy with black pepper up front. Balanced nicely with a tangy and lightly bitter hop presence on the backside.
Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, dry finish with oak at the wee end.

Some citrus in the bouquet, as well as some yeastiness. Good taste of wheat malts and some citrus. A lemon was supplied with it, but not squeezed, so the citrus was inherant. An excellent wheat!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
