1575,"2013-09-29",3.5,"Sampled at Astor Wines. Stemmy wine glass. Pretty Japanese women of proper childbearing age.

Thin, murky almond/coconut milk consistency. Short soda fizzle.

Scent of apples, bitter orange, licorice, clay.

White grapes, grapefruit. More tart then acidic. A bitterness, more fruity like tarragon then anise. Had sort of a stiff mimosa quality to it.

Short, popping carbonation. Starchy. Yeasty. Short alcohol.

Tall glasses of this in the morning seem quite appropriate.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
