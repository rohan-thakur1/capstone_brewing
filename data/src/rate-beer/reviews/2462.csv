2462,"2017-03-04",4.2,"500ml bottle bought at Great Food Hall in Pacific Place, Admiralty.
Looks: Clear copper amber colour; Explosive four finger head with crumpety orange light-beige foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Very good sticky lacing with fizzy small carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and lively dark malt, with moderate roastyness, strong mustiness, strong dark fruits, red fruits, chocolates, strong caramel, toffee, light burnt toast, floral, brown sugar, dark bread, light lemon and light grass.

Taste: Mid to strong sweet rich dark malt, with caramel, toffee, light red fruits, light dark chocolates, light floral, sugar, spices, strong dark bread, lemon, medium bitter hops and grass. Wow!

Body: Full body. Very slick and creamy palate. 

Mouth Feel: Wholesome, Schwarzbier-like dark maltyness in a thick background, very silky and smooth. All the caramel, toffee, dark chocolate and red fruits are there but they take the back seat as the pure maltyness shines! Wow! Light floral and spicy. Sneaky strong sweetness. Booze is totally hidden, lots of dark breadyness with lemon to round. Incredibly nice!

Hoppiness: Floral, light lemon and light grass in nose. Spices, light floral, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is slightly herbal for a lasting, mid-to-light astringent grassy full malty finish.

After Taste: Dry. Sweet, rich malty and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one has a strong Dunkel aroma with sweet malt and mustiness, but I am totally surprised by its full, silky dark malty taste which keeps me yearning for more. Feels like a very pumped-up Schwarzbier with all its restrained chocolate malty characters being liberated. What an experience. Great stuff!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Rich, sweet, toasty and bready malt profiles lead the aroma upfront. Notes of toffee and caramel follow, along with raisins, plums and dark stone fruit. Taste follows suit, but encompasses far more complexity than the nose implied. Soft caramel and toffee lead above an abundance of warm toasted malts, before transitioning to a complex amalgamation of dark fruits with a raisin-like sweetness leading the way; plums, figs, prunes and cherry are all detectible, along with hints of brown sugar and molasses. Towards the finish, slightly darker roast characters combine to bring traces of dark chocolate, cocoa and spice. The mouth feel is a medium to full body and moderate carbonation give a soft, smooth and creamy feel. Traces of roasted bitterness and dark chocolate linger on the finish.

2462,"2015-05-04",3.3,"12 oz bottle, poured into a tankard at ~40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a clear amber-brown, and forms a thick, fluffy light tan head with excellent retention. Lacing is somewhat insane.

Smell: Sticky buns with raisins throughout, fresh from the oven and just finished glazing, all bread and sweetness and fruit.

Taste: Sweetness is the primary characteristic, and it is present in abundance, from the first moments of the sip all the way to the finish. The sweetness is definitely bready as well, alongside a sort of coppery, metallic twang. Theres a not insignificant amount of noble hops in this beer, which lends a slightly medicinal taste to the sweetness, and an oddly bitter finish and aftertaste for a doppelbock. I get no fruit or nut aspects from the flavor, possibly due to the hop factor.

Mouthfeel: This beer doesnt exactly deliver the sort of thick, creamy, sticky mouthfeel I associate with a doppelbock, instead drinking more like a bock.

Overall: Being perfectly honest, this isnt my favorite doppelbock, nor do I classify it in the same tier as Korbinian and Celebrator. This drinks more like a maibock, and itd be a pretty darned good one.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Now having on draft for the first time (at Bierstube again). Clear dark caramel brown pour. Slight, but dense, foam on top. Looks and tastes not dissimilar to the bottle but feels juicier. Fuller raisin flavors. Nuttier notes are less pronounced. Hints of aged blood orange. Very nice dark caramel flavors without being particularly sweet at all.

2462,"2014-12-21",4.0,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a ruby brown color and has a huge cream colored head of bubbly foam. The head holds on with a pretty good retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is very sweet smelling with tons of dark fruit and caramel aromas, with the dark fruit being mainly of a plum and raisin nature. Along with these smells comes some other aromas of a molasses and a light wheaty smell.
 Taste  The taste begins with a thick sweet and toasted bready taste with the sweet being mainly of molasses and caramel with a little bit of a dark fruit tastes of plum and raisin mixed within. These flavors create a base for the brew and are all there throughout, although with some gaining strength and some losing strength as the taste advances. The darker fruits get a bit stronger at the expense of the caramel all while a little bit more roast and dark chocolate comes to the tongue. A hint of wheat and some light earthy hop come to the tongue at the very end, leaving one with a very sweet but flavorful and enjoyable flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. For the big and robust sweet and malty flavors of the brew the feel is very nice and creates a nice slower sipping brew.
 Overall  A very nice doppelbock being a little more roasted and chocolate and less fruity then others. While not the best out there, it is very good overall and is certainly one to try if you get the chance.","","Darkmagus82"

Once tasted, raisin and caramel aspects become more apparent along w/ a touch of herbal hops. This is a rather dry brew which is really nice as it allows the malts to shine w/o becoming cloying.

2462,"2014-02-27",4.5,"Draught at Bronwyn, November 2013Probably the last thing I was expecting to see at this (then) new German restaurant in Union Square. A little background. This beer was never distributed in the U.S. until very recently and back in the day (talking 2004-2007 era), there were no German traders on the site, so it was very difficult to have this without traveling there. And wow was it rated highly by just about everyone.So long story short, here I am 8 years later and finally get to try this much sought after beer.Deep ruby-mahogany liquid is clear with a small but fairly well-retained layer of light beige foam atop it.Prunes, raisins, red wine, touches of bananas, lightly salted caramel, vanilla...I could probably go on for a while here. Sweet, but not cloyingly so, a touch sour but simply from the reserved melanoidins and ever-so vinous and dry on the finish. Eminently sniffable with a good strength to it. No flaws or alcohol.Flavor is...good lord, this is why this stuff was so highly regarded! Aside from the perfect maltiness, rich but well-attenuated, very nice depth (plums, wine, caramel, vanilla, etc...) and kiss of hop spiciness, there is something so endearing and unique about their yeast character. Difficult to describe, but my best attempt is think of a Westy 8 blended with, say, Celebrator. Its certainly got black pepper phenols, plum and red currant-like fruitiness and even a touch of very light banana ester. Soft mouthfeel with light but ample carbonation. No flaws noted.

2462,"2012-05-09",4.1,"0,5 liter bottle bought in Jumbo, Santiago de Chile. Tasted while listening to ""Illuminate-Eliminate"" by the norwegian black metal band  Mayhem. Pours a dark brown/mahogany color with three fingers of an off-white head that last for a while. Aroma is hugely malty, luscious and enticing showing a wide array of scents. Initially I got toasted grains and cereals. But this Doppelbock starts quickly showing strong notes of chestnuts, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, butter and nougat. Some pumpernickel bread and licorice are there too. Taste is predominantly sweet but well-balanced with toasted bitterness. Caramel, toasted rye bread, chestnuts, wood and crystallized sugar/honey (chancaca). Fantastic. More balanced, less sweet and less alcohol-driven than Paulaner Salvator. Texture is rich, oily (not quite syrupy) with a full mouthfeel. Alcohol is invisible on this one. Long finish but the aftertaste is a little dull compared to the enormous flavor. A world-class Doppelbock I wanted to try for years. An amazing experience to taste it while listening to Mayhems 2007 masterpiece ""Ordo ad Chao"" through headphones.","Hanga Roa, Easter Island, CHILE","Panzerfaust"

2462,"2012-03-15",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/14/2011.  Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a stemmed tulip. Thanks to bauermj for bringing back this long-anticipated bottle from Europe.

Right away I notice the perfectly sized tan head that is tightly wound with bigger bubbles in the center from an aggressive pour. The beer itself has a date brown color with a ruby tint and transparent edges.

Rum soaked raisin, plum, dates, figs, and soft molasses all enter the nose. There is some clove like spiciness in the background.

The flavor starts with a rum-soaked raisin. Gooey molasses and toffee sweetness seem to coat a biscuity malt. Some plum and dates some in toward the middle. A slight metallic flavor is a bit off-putting toward the end. A soft, spicy bitterness helps to take the beer out with more balance.

There is a sweetness that coats the lips and inside of my mouth with each sip. Almost syrupy, the soft hops at the end prevent it from becoming cloying. Very creamy carbonation, but it is not as strong as it looked after the pour. The body starts medium and seems to get a bit heavier as the sip progresses.

There is a reason this is a sought after beer. Very well put together, this is the type of beer that I would drink again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

2462,"2012-03-08",4.4,"0.5L Mug On-tap at the Kloster Andechs....

Appearance: A lightly darkened caramel brown with some, but very little, reddish transparency to it. Solid bubbly consistency with a frothy head.

Aroma: Malty sweetness that hints toward caramel and bread but with its own element of fruity darkness.

Taste: Definite malt kick of caramel sweetness but with a balance of both dark fruit and hop tones that add to the subtle complexity.

Palate: Medium crisp carbonation with a smooth, highly drinkable, body. Beware! xD

Overall: For those who enjoy a good Doppelbock this is easily in the upper echelon of the style so consider it a must. This beer sets a standard. Make a mecca and go see the monastery. The food and beer are extraordinary and will set the mood for the best, most palatable, experience.

There was a time when this was a world beater, but alas that time has passed.  A truly sad rendition in recent years, and only now after several retries do I feel compelled to rate this accordingly.

Grainy and malty, rich caramel, light hazelnut (oxidation creeping in?), marzipan, maple, brown sugar, and a ton of kettle caramelization. Toasty. Alcohol and light hints of raisins. Otherwise clean with little fermentation byproducts to speak of. Minimal light spicy hop notes. Mostly all rich malt. Slight hint of age.

2462,"2010-11-30",4.5,"Huge, huge thanks to Masterski for opening this up and giving me a hefty pour at the Hunahpus release. The search for this one had been a long one, and then just fell into my lap thanks to a very generous trader.

A: Took this over to the light to get a better glimpse. The pour was a deep, roasted brown with a bit of an amber hue. A very nice off-white head.

S: Very nice slightly-sweet malt alongside caramel, toffee, a nice brisk hop presence, and a bit of brown sugar.

T: Very malty with nice caramel and brown sugar notes. Hints of dark fruit. Hop presence is a little high compared to other examples, but melds beautifully with the rest of this ones flavors.

M: Very nice. The creaminess requisite of a good bock is there, but theres also a nice dryness that comes through as well. Moderate carbonation on a medium-to-full body. Good aftertaste comes through.

D: The combination of the elegant mouthfeel and complex taste make this one well worth coming back to sip after sip. Thanks again to Alex for letting me try this one, although Ill definitely say that my search will only intensify as we get into bock season and this one keeps springing back into memory.

Goddamnit, why do bocks have to smell like tomatoes to me? There is also artificial fruity candiness, toasted bread, caramel, and something spice like, almost christmasy, perhaps a tiny bit smoky as well. As I keep sniffing, the tomato aspect kind of disappears, along with the head. Maybe Im imagining things, but its mostly gone at this point. Very sweet when drank, loads and loads of dark caramel, burnt sugar and toast, roasted malts. There is a bitterness in the finish that seems a bit metallic, but it doesnt really taste hoppy at all. Aside from that there are no hops to be found. Full bodied and generously carbonated, but it feels pretty thick and smooth. Doesnt taste strong at all, but wierdly I get this pleasurable numbing feeling in the mouth after swirling it around. This was quite enjoyable if you like the sweet stuff.

The pour it was a dark brown resembling any cola with a big off white creamy head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a small lacing

The smell (for me) it was overpowered by the malts and coffee with hints of licorice and banana.

The taste (it was awesome), malts, coffee, licorice (also my wife tasted some chocolate that i couldnt), the alcohol taste its very smooth for a 7.1% ABV, I think if you have a couple it can sneak on you. The flavor its not very long lasting the only thing that leaves behind its coffee feel in the mouth.

In all its a very light beer to drink for a dark one with complex flavors, that leaves you wanting more.

A - Dark reddish-orange copper color with an average sized foamy and creamy off-white/light beige head. Good retention with a good amount of lacing left.

S - A lot of dark malt with caramel, toffee, toasted grain and a slight bready smell. Hints of nutty and fruity smell as well. Hint of earthy hops, but this is definitely a malty beer.

T - A good balance between some dark fruit (particularly cherry) and dark toasted malt taste (prominently grainy and bready malt but the caramel and toffee flavors are also fairly strong). Very rich malt taste is present throughout. A hint of something similar to semi-sweet cocoa/chocolate is also present. Fairly sweet tasting but has a bit of a tart zing to it. Nice toasted malt flavor lingers on the tongue well after the sip.

M - Medium body with slightly above carbonation. Quite smooth with just the slightest bit of drying, sticky feel at the end.

D - Superb. Great malt flavors. It is sweet but definitely not cloying. Just a very easy to drink and enjoyable beer. The flavors are well balanced and very satisfying to taste and it goes down very easy. Too bad the ABV is a touch high.

Notes: Very nice malty beer. Sweet but not overly sweet. Just a very easy and enjoyable beer to drink. Luckily the taste also lingers a bit. It doesnt seem like a beer that blows me away or really shocks me, but rather a beer that I would happily drink everyday. Very rich flavors, but it isnt too much or cloying.

Appearance: Bottle from recently opened german beershop called Beer-Specialist. A lighter doublebock with mahogany color with ambery, coppery red hues. Breezily carbonated look. Tiny beige head with ok retention and nice lacing. 
Aroma: Nutty main impression with almost oaky wood scent. Some rosted malty tones with pure grainy, rye-bread quality. 
Flavor: Roasted walnuts, sweet chestnuts, dried figs with subtle toffee sweetness at the mid-palate. Moderate, spicy hops at the end.

Flavor starts with a combination of date, toffee and toasted malt note moving into a mild noble hops grassy kick in the middle with it finishing off with a caramel, slight walnut nuttiness and some light smokey malt note. Beer is modest to heavy in feeling with a moderately high carbonation rate. Head retention is average and the 1/4 inch head remains atop the brew through the entire rating.

2462,"2009-11-17",3.7,"Deep reddish brown with a thick tanned head of about 2 cm. The head settles after a while and leaves some lacings.

A rather big smell, very malty. Caramel, roasted malts, coffee and dark fruits. Grassy and spicy hop notes.

The taste is better than the smell would have you believe. Its not overly sweet, but heres still plenty of malty sweetness. I like how the expected caramel and bready malts are complimented by roasted malts and coffee - interesting and not very common. Lots of date-like fruity notes. Wood and a subtle herbal hop note. The finish is mildly bitter with a well integrated alcohol flavor and lingering malts.

Rather full bodied and very smooth. Quite a lot of carbonation.

As for doppelbocks go - a style I sometimes have a hard time dealing with due to the cloying sweetness some of them showcase - this is one of the better Ive had. The sweetness is not overly powerful and the ""dunkel element"" in this one adds lots of levels and flavors. Nicely balanced. But still, its not the most interesting beer in the world, and after one bottle Ive had more than enough.

This is a nice light aroma, not what I expected from a dark brew. Very subtle bread and sweetness with an almost undetectable roasted malts note in the end.

This is what a doppelbock should be, yes I have found the standard bearer. This is sweet and malty but at the same time earthy so as to keep the sweetness in check. I can’t find any alcohol present in the flavors. Smooth, creamy and rich comes to mind when trying to describe what I feel in my mouth

2462,"2008-04-01",4.2,"Best By Date March 2008; Sampled April 2008
Pours with a frothy, initially three finger thick, tan colored head that .  The beer is quite clear, despite being a dark plum color I can see through it as it sits on my desk, if held up to the light it shows a light, brilliantly clear, cranberry color that has touches of copper to it.  this has a malty aroma to it that is quite meaty, meaning it has a richness to it that I associate with umami.  Caramelized malt sugars, touches of toffee, sweet toasty bread aromatics and perhaps a touch of oxidation around the edges that seems to boost some of the rich malt notes.  There is also a distinct fruity, almost berry like note here, though it isnt always noticeable.

Richly textured though not overly heavy, it also has a nice, prickly carbonation to it that helps to lighten things on the palate just a touch.  Sweet, though not cloying, it continues to have a richness & complexity to its malt-sweetness.  The beer finishes with a touch of sharp dark malt notes, not really roast-like, but something that is going that direction with a toasty edge.  This almost has a cocoa note to it at times, especially when the beer hits the taste buds right such that it tastes drier than normal.  I really like the heft and texture of this brew, it is chewy & rich with a certain viscousness to it, yet it is still easily drunk 500ml at a time.  The malt character really takes on a rich bread-like flavor that is somewhere between a chewy whole grain bread and a lightly sweet, faintly spiced, holiday bread.  This actually has a fantastic malt depth & character to it & it really lingers quite well on the tongue; changing from sweet to rich to toasty to caramelized.  A light hop bitterness kicks in towards the beginning of the finish and provides a touch of balance to the rich malt character.

This just gets better as it warms up a bit and I work my way through this glass; I cant quite pinpoint why (though I dont think it is just the alcohol), but it just is so rich, chewy and drinkable all at the same time.  A wonderful beer, that I will most definitely have to get more of at some point in the future.  Id be curious what a fresh bottle of this would taste like, though this one is not noticeably over the hill in any way.  This perhaps started out a bit slow (though still really good), but it has picked up lots of steam, finishes incredibly strong and I am now wishing I had more of this sitting in my glass right now; this is really quite fantastically tasty.  Letting it warm up really makes this beer shine.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Aroma of dark roasted caramel malt, raisins, some sweet chocolate, dried dark pitted fruit and some citrus hops. Taste is smooth, creamy, full bodied with some carbonation and texture. Taste flavor matches its aroma with more roasted malt and chocolate flavors. Finish is semi-sweet with a lingering malt and alcohol aftertaste. I would like to try this brewery fresh the next time.

I can discern that the body is light/medium and the carbonation is a bit too high for my liking...it is strange but this almost reminds me of a hoppy Pac Nw American brown ale with slightly excessive carbonation...it isnt that of course, and likely is not even close in the ingredients used..but it does have many of those same characteristics.","Oregon, USA","kenb"

The afternoon had now reached that nulling peak where the activity heightens as well as slows, the sun peaks as well as withdraws, the back-packers think their next plan as well as plan to head back to the hostel. The last one was us, and this was sadly my last brew at this evangelical Tap. Oh, and maybe a few more Spezials from the oak, danke viel mals. Served up the deepest shade of ruby with a tawny edge making it resemble a thin port. The crown was very dense, a well retained bed of beige-ish cream that legged well as I supped (after all we had chasers, I had time!). Savoury, minced fruit, meaty malt and a distinct wash of ripe plums on the nose. In fact there added a little vinous, red wine like a merlot en-route as the beer heated up. Served a little too chilled I waited to taste it. Satisfied; its quite rich, complex yet well melded and oozing in well-charged, spiced Christmas pudding flavours. Sweet liqueur front, savoury mid-section before a very dry burnt sugar, lip-smacking, forest cake-like heaviness and a touch of that mellowing red-wine in back. It has good length, a good warmth of alcohol here aids
 its general fortified wine flavours. The body, though, is unbelievably light for a beer of such volatile characters. It is a nice drop, one of the better Dunkel stark-biers of my trip but Id still favour a good Helles over this. Good stuff!!!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Thanks to StewartOfGondor for bringing this back from Europe.  I thought it
   was going to be the last rate of the night until very late when a special
   suprise came out.  Check my next review to see what it was.  If this was
   a decent nightcap, the next was an encore to end all encores.
Aroma / Appearance - I actually found aspects of this beer mystifying.
   The nose reminded me of wet cat food, cocoa, honeycomb and cookie dough.
   Sans the cat food it would have been great.  The body was a rich caramel,
   almost toffee, with thin oily head playing around the glass.
Flavor / Palate - The taste makes up for most of the flaws of the nose.
   Almonds, caramel, apple butter, brown sugar, wheat, roasted malt and a vague
   sweetness play throughout the sample at various stages.  A nice cross between
   a doppelbock and a dunkel, it hhas good qualities of both.  Fairly unique
   and enjoyable though not quite a 4 in my opinion.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Breadiness was subtle underneath it all. This one was excellent and avoided any cloyingness that a rich and deep doppelbock might otherwise offer.

2462,"2006-04-25",4.7,"On tap at the Andechs Bräustüberl and Klostergasthof (yeah, I drank a lot of it that day.)  Translucent cherry lacquered mahogany in color with a resplendently creamy, dense tan head, which is 3/4"" thick, leaving thick and sticky lacing.  Near aromatic perfection: maple and brown sugar masted on cedar bark, rummy toffee, chocolate caramel chews and a cursive ribbon of cocoa butter and pralines.  Flavor embodies deliciousness in every sense.  Charming milk chocolate and unsweetened chocolate-toffee candied malt balls.  Chocolate-rye meets whole wheat biscuits + whole wheat baguettes.  Pecans scraped out of copper cans, and a natural cocoa powdered flavor over a bran flake conjecture.  Achieves the epitome of balance - full-bodied, tamed and natural carbonation, and the best backdrop of subtle, spicy hops to accompany a resplendent stream of liquid wonderment.  This is easily the prototype of doppelbocks.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Toasted bready flavors with light caramel, nutty, melanoidins in the middle for more sweetness and body, and some mollasses.  Smooth as silk, and not too thick like some doppelbocks.

There is some light plumminess there as well along with some clean but aromatic noble hops.  Body is nicely balanced, has a bit of peppery alcohol bite, but there is still enough maltiness to balance.  Some nutty and slightly oxidized aromas seem to be in here.  Flavour is balanced.  Its a tasty enough brew, but not all that special either.

2462,"2006-01-28",5.0,"Kloster Andechs is a monastery on top of a mountain that sits in the shadow of the Bavarian Alps. The monastery grounds are absolutely beautiful and is surrounded by rich farm land which is owned and worked by the Kloster. Why Andechs is important to a beer lover, is the fact that the Benedictine monks that established this Kloster, also established a brewery in 1455. The Rule of St. Benedict is, as a monk, you have to live by the work of your hands. The work these monks do at Andechs is the brewing some of the most incredible beer on the planet. I have tasted thousands of beers in my life time as a beer drinker, and Andechs Dopplebock Dunkel could possibly be the best beer I have ever tasted in all my years of drinking. It is most certainly the most impressive dopple bock I have ever tried, and drinking a one liter mass of this beer fresh vom fass was a spiritual experience for me. 

Andechs Dopplebock Dunkel pours to a beautiful, bright, chestnut color with a thick and creamy tan head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderful with deep toasty, nutty and sweet malty aromas. This leads in to a sweet malty, toasty, and nutty palate on a round, smooth, clean, and polished body. Andechs Dopplebock Dunkel finishes with more deep malt character up front, then ends with just enough hop bitterness to take the cloying edge off this beer. There is also a nice subtle, peppery alcohol burn that lingers with flavors of malt on the tongue. 

Stylistically this beer is flawless. As a dopple bock it is perfect. It is a master piece of the brewers art. Ive had some tremendous dopple bocks in my day, but I am yet to taste one that is better than this beer. I can not put into words the depth of malt aromas and flavors in this beer, and how fantastic this beer really is. You will just have to come to Germany to try this one for yourself, as it is not exported to the US. I was fortunate enough to enjoy 2 liters of this one on a wonderful trip to Andechs, and encourage anyone who is going to Bavaria to take a day trip out to the Kloster.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

But without a doubt, the bottles hit quite often (my current one has some nice smoke undertones and light peach groaning under the weight of cherry), and the tap experience can be utterly sublime  -- cherry dominance to rival a kriek, plums to match the best quads, lightly spicy hops and some of the best malt depth in central Europe.

2462,"2005-06-05",3.7,"Another thanks to my roommate Skidz for bringing this back from Germany for me!  After the initial pour, it appeared to be a rather dark, murky brown, but when looking at the body through the light, after wiping away all of the condensation due to the cold glass and high humidity, it actually turns out to be a dark reddish amber, cola-like.  Nice, lasting head.  Nutty aroma, with light burnt caramel and brown sugar.Very full, slightly roasty flavor, heavy on very sweet malts.  Raisins as well.  I was surprised by the moderate hop presence.  A little too sticky sweet for my tastes.  Lastling light bitterness in the back of the mouth.  A great beer, but I think it would have been much more enjoyable on a day with less heat and humidity!  The syrupy sweetness bothered me a bit in my nearly sweltering apartment.","California, USA","tomxcs"

2462,"2005-05-27",3.8,"First of all, thanks Nat! 500ml bottle. Served at 53.5° (~12°C) in my NB worthy glass. Pours dark crimson red with a smallish off-white/nearly tan head. The beer coats the glass when swirled.  Aroma is sweet malt, milk chocolate, dark fruits, with hints of noble hops? The mouthfeel is full, but not overly so. The taste is malty with the noble hops? grassiness and spiciness. There are flavors of tofee, vanilla, prunes?, and pepper? The finish is slightly bitter and finishes clean. I havent had a dopplebock in a long while, but this seems a bit different from the ones I have had, there is less sweetness and fullness of body and more drinkability; it would be far too easy to spend an afternoon drinking this beer and at 7%, the alcohol might just sneak up on you.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

2462,"2005-03-07",3.8,"Aroma seems to be primarily chocolate, toasted coconut, nuts (Almond Joy?!) and rich caramel.  I like the aroma but it seems distinctly un-bockish.  It has a lot of the elements in there, but something is missing.  The head is, sadly, shortly lived and lacing isnt great either.  We tried several glasses but could get nothing to stick.  Still the body has a great hue to italways changing color depending on the lightIll call it dark amber for arguments sake.  The flavor starts sweet, but thin, and builds towards the end.  Rich tasting like very dark bread.  Body is medium and slick with average carbonation.  The bottom line is: A bit different than most doppelbocks Ive had (pretty varied style eh?) but not bad by a long shot.

Moderate phenols and anise star like quality add to the nose. The taste starts as expected, sweet and roasty with just a nice counter balance of fruit twang and pepper for depth.

First, this has a beautiful full head which is often missing or diminished in the Doppelbocks. Dark mahogany pour with a head of light tan. 
Rich malty nutty aroma that really invites a taste. Caramel and butterscotch. Full flavored, rich and malty yet avoids all aspects of being overly sweet or cloying - perfect balance.

Very full-flavored, to say the least.  Mouthfeel features some lively carbonation carrying the flavors rather well.  Body is medium-full.  Different in its flavor development and complexity.

Flavour and aroma open up to reveal its full majesty as it warms.

2462,"2004-09-26",4.4,"Generous off-white head forms atop the dark brown body. Head is foamy, frothy, sticky, moderately lasting. Light ruby hints make the color seem complex. A truck of malt in the aroma. Various flavours of smoked fruits, red berries, blue berries, cherries, light smoke, light roast. Terrific integration of the aromatic components. Another sniff gave me mineralic or salty notes. Another hinted me toward bread. Yet another proposed candy sweetness almost approaching honey. If the aroma contained a truck of malt, its 2 trucks you have when sipping. Its intensity is pushed further although always staying in the subtlety grace as opposed to a celebrator. Incredible precision, every angle is well cut. Bolder than the aroma in its leathery expression. Quite dry overall. Nut skin, roasty and earthy light hops finish. Could last a little longer perhaps. It really tastes like fresh and clean water was used. Incredible malt depth they have there. Gets even better as it warms, close to a 10 as far as taste is concerned, I guess just a bit more length would nail it. Polite medium to full body, high carbonation is at the limit of being too much.

Appearance: partially clear, dark ruby hue, an enigmatic appearance, really, clear here, dark there, obtuse in places, with a lovely, lush layer of pale, tanned foam standing guard on top.
Aroma: caramel & spice, soft & creamy, lightly toasted, with subtle fruit.
Taste: luscious fruit proclaims itself at the onset, a beautiful blend of grape, cherry, berry, & more, supported by a warm, generous malt bill.
More flavors interject as we continue, raisins, figs, chocolate climbs aboard, too, for a spell, contributing a subtle, sensuous cocoa feel all over the palate. 
Sublime, really.
This mere 7.1% ABV doppelbock only peeps up the tiniest bit in alcohol feel, so smooth it is, so rich with flavor, not harsh, nor brash, mellow, cool, yet bold with flavor, getting winey-er and winey-er in taste as we go.

Some slight alcohol warming as well. Finish is much the same as the taste - more malt and caramel. Damn good beer!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

2462,"2004-03-10",2.5,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2011 So, my last experience with this was in early 2004.  Now, judging from my recent two draught samples in Bavaria (one at Andechser am Dom, in Munich, and one at the brewery), where I encountered overwhelming tartness in each, I can only surmise that either my palate has drastically changed, or something is awry at the brewery. In each .5 liter I ordered, of which I could only muster one sip, sourness and  a limp, frail body were prevalent. So poor, in fact, that I didnt even want to spend the time re-rating it. Their Jubiläumsbier Dunkel, which I tasted at the brewery, had a similar tartness albeit a bit more subdued. And the Spezial Hell was quite grainy and riddled with DMS. The Weissbier Hefetrüb, on the other hand,  was quite lovely, so who the hell knows whats going on. Was it a coincidence that three of the four beers I tasted were seriously flawed during my visit, or has this brewery changed for the worse?  I cannot imagine  the monks being happy with this stuff. Previous score was a 4.3, but the stuff now is undrinkable and my score has been adjusted accordingly.  Clear brown rust. Light tan head quickly fizzles into nothing. Luscious aromatic blend of tangy, roasted, toffeed malts with a suggestion of charred sugars, soft minerals, and alcohol-soaked bread. Subtle vinous, unsweetened chocolate, and raisin notes envelop the soft, leafy noble hop character. Miniscule carbonation. Melted sugar mouthfeel. Feathery roastiness briefly tames the charred sugar tingle before a stifling array of doughy, toasted, and chocolate maltiness. Succulent milk chocolate notes dominate toward the finish while the charred sugars and tangy malts continue to make their stamp on the palate. Intense firm black malts match the charred sugars with just enough pale malt husks and smoke   to temper the tingle. Roasted/sugared malt blend, creamed coffee, butter toffee and restrained herbal hop notes remain long after finish. Pretty remarkable brew, but, frankly, this fresh sample lacks a creamy body and the malt sweetness masks the sublime Hallertauer aromas and flavors.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

New rating from the monastery correcting my previous sin:
The DM & Hotstuffs European Honeymoon trip beer number 67. This draft brew from the monastery in Andechs Germany poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored mostly diminishing bubbles that diminish then linger around for a long time.  The head left behind a semi-transparent dark caramel ruby red brown colored body with no visible carbonation.  The aroma contained notes of brown and mild caramel malts.  I wished the aroma were stronger, but alas it was not.  The mouth feel was initially very smooth mildly tingly and lingered in the finished then goes away leaving a nice caramel malt lingering aftertaste. The flavor contained a nice mix of smooth brown malts and caramel malts that leave a mild tingly sensation on the sides of the tongue.  Still a wonderful beer and my all-time favorite because of the memories it brings back.  Simply a wonderful must have beer!  Excellent!  7-5-9-5-19","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

Good body strength; the flavor is quite malty, even if there is a dominance of caramel and light roasted malts, also with a nutty touch; the final shows more the roasted malts than the malt and the body is a bit drier, therefore not resulting as an exceptional beer.2003-01-20, 8-5-9-5-18=45Brown, dark amber color with ruby shades; beautiful, generous, thick creamy head.Malt aroma, sweetish, very light Madeira; aroma typical of Dunkles.Sweet, loads of malt, balanced by the bitterness only at the end. Solid, absolutely well balanced, powerful, malty, aromatic hop at the end.Undoubtedly one of the best bottled German beers.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2462,"2003-01-17",3.3,"The same color as the old penny at the bottom of the fountain at the mall.   Nice aroma for a Doppel (most smell like dumpster-juice to me), but I detected that awful sweet stench as it warmed.  Served cold, it was tasty and had a nice alcohol presence (needed to even the sweetness).  Not a top fifty in my opinion, but it was fun searching for it.  Don't let it get warm, for it turns to garbage.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
2462,"2003-01-02",2.5,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2006 Jan, 2003 Drag me round the school yard and dump me in the garbage bin. I got the flavours, yes - sweet licorice for sure, and some farmyard stuff as well, still clinging to my boots, but I failed to hear the choir singing. Lager is lager is lager. The dark stuff tastes better than the light stuff, and I do prefer it, but at the end of the glass it is still a thin watery substance that doesnt do for the mouth, the heart, the soul and the limp biscuit that passes itself off as manhood, what ale does. This was as tasty a lager as Ive had - full marks for that - but the flavours were divorced at gunpoint from the wimpy pink carnation body mincing around the catwalk with its bum sticking out. The flavours were screaming for a hunky ale body to cling to - something decent and substantial like a Volvo or a Jaguar rather than the moped with the fake leopard skin seat which its got. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger riding a thin pink moped, and he dont look happy, and it aint very pretty. Now stop fooling about and give me a Stout. [2.4]
June, 2004 Ok. I tried this again. I didnt actually remember it was this one I had previously drunk. I bought a few dunkels to get to grips with this dark lager. I have yet to appreciate the style fully, but this one - the last of the bunch - did sit more comfortably with me than the previous examples. The flavour is all there, and the body - after having got accustomed to dark lagers - while light, is not entirely disfunctional. [3.0]

2462,"2002-07-17",4.8,"This was an elixir.  The flavor balance was fascinating--you get the savory flavors like caramel, chocalte, roasted nuts, and yet you also get the fruity sweet flavors, like banana, strawberry, plum.  Such complexity.  And of course, as it warmed up, things changed, making it all so much fun to drink.  Overall, it had all the flavor complexity (and many other similarities) of a Belgian dubbel, but just slightly less airiness to it.  No beer can be perfect.  The perfect beer for me might be the median point between this and the Traquair Jacobite.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

A very clean, dry though creamy feel. The finish is a long, clean licorice bitter -- very unique though not altogether amazing. The 7.1 goes down easy.
