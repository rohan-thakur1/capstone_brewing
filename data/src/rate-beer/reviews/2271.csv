2271,"2016-09-17",3.9,"2014-es verzió. A Straffe Hendrik Quadrupel karaktere még elevenen él bennem, legalábbis az ital kortyolgatása közben úgy éreztem, van némi viszonyítási alapom a korábbi emlékeim alapján. Az már az első percek során nyilvánvalóvá válik, hogy a hordóérlelés hatása nem múlik el nyomtalanul, a vörösboros karakter igen erőteljesen munkálkodik a főzetben. A mélybarna, gesztenye testre természetesen krémes, elefántcsont hab telepszik, medvecukros, mégis fanyar, ""sour brown""-szerű illatai meglepő intenzitással bukkanak elő alóla. Egy valamirevaló borsznob semmi esetre sem menne el szó nélkül a tanninok játéka mellett, jómagam is csatlakoznék hozzájuk: a vörösboros, fekete bogyós gyümölcsös, szárított vadvirágos, csillagánizsos, telt és savas jegyek igen komplex ízélményt nyújtanak, a fás hangulatok érettséget kölcsönöznek a quadrupelnek, az érlelés nagyot mélyít a szerkezeten, ám furcsa módon valahogy ki is könnyíti azt. Súlytalannak persze botrány lenne nevezni a karaktert, mint ahogy nyilvánvaló módon egyáltalán nem is az, mindenesetre egy árnyalattal teltebb jelleget még éppen elviselne a tökéletesség benyomásához. Ez persze már csak kekeckedés, aminek legfeljebb egy ilyen kaliberű italnál lehet helye, a legtöbb főzde természetesen csak álmodhat az ilyen alkotásokról.","HUNGARY","adster"

Eerst dacht ik dat de carbonatie erg aangetast was, omdat er wat bier gelekt was langs de kurk. Gelukkig is deze behoorlijk in orde, slechts een licht verlies van carbonatie. Diepe donkerbruine kleur met een rode gloed en een medium hoge beige schuimkraag, die zich terugtrekt. Aromas van karamel mout, rozijnen, vijgen, rood fruit, chocolade, eikenhout, vanille en notities van rode wijn, port, bierkelder en leer. Het smaakpallet is licht geoxideerd, en zeer complex, zacht zoet en gebalanceerd, met zoete tonen, van vanille en gedroogd fruit als rozijnen, dadels en vijgen, gecombineerd met meer aardse tonen van, cacao, eikenhout en zelfs wat leerachtige accenten. De afdronk is zacht licht droog, met een houtige vineuze finish, toch iets verlies van carbonatie, want is bij deze fles vrij zacht. De gewone Quadrupel van Straffe Hendrik is als erg goed, maar deze 4 jaar gerijpte Heritage is werkelijk fantastisch, complex met een perfecte rijping op eiken vaten. Prachtig bier uit Brugge, een quad die het geld zeker waard is, ook zeer geschikt om te laten rijpen. Ook hier weer een voorbeeld dat de klassieke Belgische brouwerijen uitstekend mee kunnen met de craftbeer en BA trends.

2271,"2014-12-25",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2015 Wine barrel aged version of Straffe Hendrik Quadrupel, coming from a 75 cl bottle with cork and muselet packed in a fancy wooden case with print on the front side; limitedly produced, the bottle is even numbered (in this case n° 26810). Vintage tasting of the 2013 version so must be about 1,5 years of age. Thin and initially quickly dissolving, loose, light beige head consisting of rather large bubbles; all that remains after five minutes is a steady rim around the edge and some thin lacing, but as the bottle progresses, the head becomes more stable and more sticky. Colour is a beautiful, very dark wine red, clear at first but hazy with deposit. Tempting and complex aroma of banana liqueur, Syrah wine (my favorite grape), vanilla, cherry pralines, chocolate sauce, crème de cassis, liquorice, old red port wine, cashew nuts, honey, steak, cognac, orange juice and orange peel, brown bread, woody tannins, leather, cloves, figs in jenever, red berries, candied dates, Kirsch, maple syrup and a faint hint of coffee. Rounded, sweet onset of candied fruits, banana, dates, pear and raisins, Syrah wine again, medium carbo, subtle citrussy acidity, yeasty spiciness, full and mellow chocolatey, nutty and caramelly maltiness, honeyish candi sweetness lingering, the carbonation tingling on the tongue, evolving into a yeasty and malt sweet finish with an explicit, yet elegant presence of woody tannins, gentle roasted bitterness (much like in a Scotch), red wine and peppery hops cleansing the somewhat sticky candi sweetness; retronasally, the port and sherry notes resulting from an early stage of oxidation as well as the vanilla-like oak tannins only add to its complexity. I have a feeling this bottle has about the perfect age for a tasting session, though I have to admit I am curious about its cellaring potential. Vinous, rich, complex, sweet in a very noble and restrained way and charming especially on a December night, this is easily one of the best Belgian ales I tasted in the past few months. Highly recommendable, if it can still be found today. Honestly speaking, I hadnt expected this kind of quality from this particular brewery; it is a good thing that the established mainstream breweries in Belgium are still on the lookout for whatever happens in the craft beer world, and pick up new tendencies every now and then.  I hope to see more of this quality level in Belgium in the future!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Smaken: redelijk zoet, matig tot redelijk bitter, redelijk fruitig (rozijn, pruim, vijg), gebrande (niet overdreven) en caramouten, vanille, lichte laurier, en wat tannine, caramel, dus lekker complex. Maar wat opvalt is toch de redelijke kruidige/bitterheid wat de quadrupel als basis ook heeft, hier ook behoorlijk terugkomt.

Aroma: earthy and sweet

Appearance: Pours around 20 on SRM scale. Deep chestnut brown to mahogany, red tones. Active caramel tan head, slightly foamy, dissipates to mild ring and cap. 

Taste: I cant explain it. Its complex. Overall sweetness, malty, tasty. Notes of the oak barrel like vanilla. Taste a bit of plum it seems. As good as the non-aged quad. I havent had that for a while to compare, it is probably a bit better, I tend to like the aged versions better.

Palate/Mouthfeel: right down the middle, not thin but not thick. Rich not creamy. Carbonation on the tail end.

2271,"2012-12-13",4.0,"75 cl bottle. Pours ay amber with a small off white head. Fruity, wineous and dark toasted malty. Smooth fruity, oaky and berries. Mild sweet, caramelish and lingering fruity. Smooth and wineous finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
2271,"2012-12-13",3.4,"Bottle 75 cl. Courtesy of yespr. Pours a hazy, reddish brown with a dense off-white head. Rather sophisticated aroma, clearly oaky but also with a herbal balsamico tint to it. Rich body, interesting base of overripe fruit, oak, spices and then again the slight tartness. Hardly any bitterness. Different. 131212","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
2271,"2012-12-09",3.9,"750, corked and baled. Pours a murky opaque dark brown, fairly grainy. Huge, beautiful, surging tan head. Loose drippy fluffy lace. Mild sweet oak, vanilla, and shortbread nose, with a light accent of tartness lingering in the background. Creamy medium body with light carb. Nicely balanced mid palate, bring elements of malt, yeast, and barrel into harmony--theres some toasty shortbread, some bright lactic sharpness, and a pleasant vanilla and woody bite. Beautifully integrated and a pleasure to drink.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2271,"2012-12-06",4.0,"Aromas of blackberry, pine, hints of licorice, spicy oak,  a bit of nutmeg and clove, some other fragrances that I cant fully parse out.

Dark, dark brown body with a boisterous off white head that leaves rocky lacing behind.  Great looking Belgian ale.

Tastes of rich and sweet toffee like malt with a very drying oak component.  Anise and raisin.  This is one big ass beer with tons of flavor.  Kinda feels like my taste buds are being pulled from one flavor to the next in rapid succession.  Impression of nut/seasame seed flaor in the long lingering finish accompanied by much more obvious dark berries and oak.

Well carbonated, medium bodied, tastes sweet despite an impression of being quite dry.

Quite enjoyable.  Definitely not a traditional quad.  The oak component is rad, but the berry flavors could be a tad more subtle.","USA","billshmeinke"

2271,"2012-10-30",4.2,"Bedankt aan Kraddel die de fles heeft gedeeld. Fles nr. 970 trouwens en verpakt in een onbewerkte houten kistje, het soort dat jij in de middelbaar kunt maken tijdens de lessen hout. Dit was echt wel een grote verassing voor mij, absoluut geen fan van de Halve Maan, meer marketing en imago dan goed bier wat mij betreft, zou zij eerder bij Leffe plaatsen dan eender welke andere Belgische brouwerij en van het basis bier dat hiervoor gebruikt is geweest ben ook niet bepaald voor te vinden maar dit was echt wel lekker. Redelijk donker bruin met niet al te grote maar netjes stevige beige kraag. Ruikt naar zoete mokka, hout, chocolade, vanille, lichte kruiden en zoete rode snoep. Smaakt lichtjes bitter met een lichte wijnsmaak die door het geheel loopt (nergens gevonden op wat voor vaten dit gelegen heeft, pure eik neem ik aan maar ik krijg hier toch echt wel wat wijn), mokka, zacht, goedkopere spul, vanille, kruiden, redelijk wat zoetigheid, karamel, gedroogd donker fruit. Iets te veel koolzuur hier helaas met iets te lichte structuur overal. Des ondanks dit is echt wel goede rijping, ik moet zeggen, dat ik onder de indruk ben.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

2271,"2012-08-25",3.8,"Extremely stable, huge cream-tan head, very dense & fine, over deep red-brown beer with a cold haze. Sourish-lactic nose, very appetizeing, sour fruit, crabapples, diary. Iron in the head! Severe, dry-bitterish woody flavour with (non-sweet) liquorice, plain chocolate, resin and lactic acid in the background. Faint vanilla. Raisins or very ripe red grapes without (most of) the sweetness. Warming up, gets a buttery touch. Very viscous, obvious alcoholwarming, full bodied. Well worth seeking out; character of strong Oud Bruin.
