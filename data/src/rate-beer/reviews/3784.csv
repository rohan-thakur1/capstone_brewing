Taste is medium to heavily sweet, drying and becoming slightly bitter towards finish. Sweet, wheaty maltiness and yeast are prominent: flavours of plum, raisin and caramel. The palate is medium to full bodied, velvety smooth and low in carbonation. Rich and potent. Definitely a Dutch take on this style; displays quadrupel-like qualities more than those that are characteristic to German weizenbocks.","Helsinki, FINLAND","Marstonlad"

3784,"2016-05-16",4.0,"The beer looks great. The color of the beer is dark brown on the eye. With a really strong light behind it, a reddish glow is unveiled. The beer has quite some cloudiness. No surprise, because the beer is unfiltered. On top of the beer, a nice layer of rather rough almond colored foam is formed. The bulk of the foam collapses, leaving almost nothing behind. The smell is a bit disappointing. For a top 50 beer, Ive had expected a bit more. The smell is a bit to mild. There are some nice aromas of sweet chocolate and roasted malts. There is also a little sour aroma, of dark Forrest fruits. There is also a creamy touch. The more songs you take, the better the smell gets. After a while, the smell is quite nice. The beer just needs some time to come to live. It shouldnt be served to cold. The taste of the beer is nice, but not the best in the world. There are flavors of chocolate, red forrest fruits, toast, roasted grains, licorice, almonds and alcohol. Its just like the flavors most bok beers have. It isnt bad, the contrary. Its just that my expectations where a tiny bit higher. The finish is a bit watery and had a touch of metal. There is also a nice amount of almonds in the finish.

The beer itself is pitch black on the eye and only with a strong wintery beam of sunlight a brown color is revealed. Man, is this beer dark. The smell is very nice. It has a nice little wild yeas touch to it, which is a little sour. There is also a strong bittersweet licorice smell and the bitternes of a tiny bit of roasted barley. The smell has a good balance between sweetness, bitterness and a little sourness. The taste is very good as well. It has the same little roasted barley and licorice touch to it. The beer has a nice strong bitterness, balanced out by a nice sweetness and a little sour touch. The finish is very nice and, bitter and has something savory.

Sweet, slightly sticky, aroma, touch of treacle hinted at. Very deep red, small persistent tight tan head. Full, but soft and smooth in the palate, very mellow and comforting. Served at a great temperature - no chill to this at all, helps keep it mellow. Taste is a weird one - its all over the place, different with every sip. First some candifloss, then a more typical belgian strong dark ale, then some stouty roastiness, then some almond. This truly defies style bounds, without having to be imperial, or include dog bollocks. All the while, the taste of the alcohol is well hidden. Theres a nice warming aspect to the feel after swallowing, puts a smile on you face and makes you feel welcome on an icy winter night. Later finish, in particuler after the stouter aspects have come through in the taste, is quite biningly bitter - a very nice little bite, and a metallic tingle to the teeth on the touch of the tongue - nice.

3784,"2014-10-21",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2016

Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, dark fruit, berries, chocolate and roasted malts.

Appearance:

Opaque dark brown/black beer with medium yeast and with a slight/medium beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, dark fruit, berries and chocolate; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Always love when the brewer dares to add roasted malts to such a beer. Would say it is more of a Doppelbock than a Weizen Bock.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
