Poured at fridge temperature into a Mikkeller signature glass reveals a cloudy golden body with a relatively thin, snowy white head that fades somewhat leaving lace and lots of beautiful lace. Decent regeneration. Aroma is citra goodness with some dank and resiny notes of citrus, sweat, grapefruit and a tiny weeny amount of cats urine. Once again were in the fresh, elegant and harmonious end of the DIPA scale that has served to reignite my enthusiasm for the style, which used to be turned off by the scourge of rocket fuel. Not so for this one, which retains a high degree of drinkability. Compared to the Society and Solitude this one is perhaps slightly heavier in the flavour department. Theres hop resin and a moderate driness in the finish. Still a very pleasant exposition of one of my favourite hops.

Copper-gold and a huge, well-retained, white head.Citra in the nose, believe it or not, showing no urea whatsoever, but tons of nectarine, lemon, fresh thyme and light grapefruit. Yeah, thats about as good as it gets for citra, though theres some malt lurking not so lightly behind it. A bit of caramel, earth and bread do indeed show through. It matches the citra pretty well, though, and does seem to balance the light juicy citrus notes. Not explosively aromatic, but then thats not Shauns specialty. What it lacks in Tree House character, it makes up for in ""grows-on-you"" appeal. The more it warms and breathes, like almost all of his beers, the more it just screams execution.In the mouth its full of lemon, white grapefruit and a softer orange juice pulpiness. Lots of herbal and nectarine dryness, with a fair amount of caramel-tinged honey. At times I think it gets too malty/sweet but my roomate points out that she likes the sweetness and that it makes it easier to drink. Coming from a wine drinker, thats an interesting observation. In some respects, it does make the hoppiness easier to bear, and theres no lack of bitterness here.

314,"2015-07-07",4.7,"Location: Pour from a two litter Hill Farmstead growler I just picked up at the brewery, 7/7/15


Aroma: The aroma is full of bright tropical and citrus hops, peach, mango, floral notes, and some light malt.  Amazing.  It really just hits all the marks of a tropical forward, hoppy beer.

Appearance: From the bulbous growler it pours a murky looking bright (like almost highlighter level) orange with a thick, frothy, white head and some lace that pretty much coats the glass.

Flavor: This one drinks really nicely with a strong tropical/fruity hop flavor, great balance. The hops shine through here with just a right on mix of the bitterness and the sweetness. 

Palate: Medium-plus bodied, with a smooth, creamy feel, soft carbonation, and a clean, dry finish.

Overall Impression: 
This is one of those beer that the more I drink the more I like. From the sample at the brewery, I thought this was my favorite of their excellent beers that were pouring that day, but Ive had a good 2+ glasses of it at this point, and know I know, this beer is an absolute knockout. The brightness of the fruity hops, the perfect cleanness of the bitterness, the smoothness of the mouthfeel, everything here is just right on. Seriously, for anyone who wonders if its worth driving out to the middle of fucking nowhere to get their beers, my answer is yes.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Taste is moderately bitter with a nice malt backbone. A little more bitterness on this then some of the other Hill Farmstead IPAs as well as not as creamy a mouthfeel as some. Flavors of citrus and tropical fruits with some pine and cracker malt notes. Definitely one of the best imperial IPAs I've had.

La mousse - cette mousse blanche comme neige qui sagrippe à mon verre nen finit pas de dessiner des dentelles me remplit de bonheur et témoigne dune bière onctueuse, affirmée et structurée comme peu dimpériale IPA peuvent se vanter de lêtre! En regardant le tout, je ne me rends même pas compte que machinalement, japproche mon grand nez de mon verre, comme hypnotisé. Le verre est encore à une distance dun avant-bras de mon nez quune bague de jus de mangue me fouette en plein visage. Oh là là que cest olfactif! Ça sent la mangue, la pêche, lannana... Un nez totalement enivrant! En bouche, tout est absolument exquis. En plus davoir du corps, cette bière nest pas quune explosion gratuite de houblons. On reconnaît la signature fermière et sauvage de la Maison qui manoeuvre étroitement entre les styles Saison et IPA.

Taste is at first slightly week for a DIPA but as it warms there is some sweetness and an overly bitter lemon/orange rind. A little thin at first on the finish but evens out ok.

The beer is yellowish, on the fringes of orange. Its ever so slightly hazy, appearing clear for the most part. The head is about 1/2"" thick and leaves a healthy amount of lacing behind.

A - This beer is beautiful. Subtle tangerine appearance soft and full of clouds. 2-Fingers of off-white head was formed on a slow formed. Not much lacing and subsided quickly. 

S - Alright! Grapefruit, tangerines, birch and floral notes. The citra is absolutely amazing! DOUBLE of everything great about my favorite hop.

T - This is an extremely soft beer up front. I get the fresh lemon zest, orange pulp and grapefruit rinds. Bitterness approaches fast and swift as the liquid coats my tongue and leaves behind this very meaty intense bitterness that stays alive for quite a while. The only thing to do is simple take another sip.

M - Wow. Mouth filling carbonation. 80% carbonation on the mouth swish. Light body despite the Double IPA style and dry bitter finish.

A - Pours murky orange with a nice pillow of one finger tall white head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.

S - Smells of strong, floral, citric hops throughout this one. Hints of tropical fruits, mostly grapefruit, and some light pine round out one awesome nose.

T - Huge blast of citric hops up front never really leaving the picture throughout the experience. Some strong grapefruit and mango flavors emerge once the hops die down a bit. Only the faintest trace of booze toward the end. Finish has plenty of lingering hop bitterness in it. Damn, this is one tasty hop bomb. Glad I got to try it!

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slick, hoppy, feel with plenty of bitterness lingering thru the finish.

O - I am not sure which I prefer, this one or the regular version. Either way both are excellent hop bombs. It is easy to drink and is packed with delicious hops. When it comes to hoppy beers it seems Hill Farmstead can do no wrong.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

314,"2011-07-19",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2013 In short: A big uber-hoppy blonde IPA full of exotic and tropical fruits and way too easy to drink
How: Tap at the brewery
The look: Cloudy yellow-blonde body topped by a small white head
In long: Nose is classic Citra to me, which means tropical/exotic fruits and cat urine.  I just cant help it but get cat urine from any  heavily Citra-hopped beer.  Taste is big bed of fresh chewy cereals and a lot of exotic and tropical fruits and light notes of cheese.  The bitterness level is probably pretty high but the beer is never aggressive, this is not a biting harsh bitterness, it is round and only slightly resinous.  Overall this beer is as good as a Citra monster can be but there is something with me and Citra (cat urine) that prevents me from enjoying it as much as other Hill Farmstead double ipas.  But objectively, this is a great beer.  I dont know I seem to be the only one to notice cat urine aroma in Citra-hopped beers, maybe Im better at noticing things than any of you guys, I bet none of you has noticed that that the word ""OK"" looks like a little person lying on his side.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Pours a clear golden-orange color with a large white head and a moderate amount of lacing on the way down. Thin collar throughout. The nose brings a super-heavy hop presence with loads of tropical and citrus notes, as well as a few floral notes. The flavor is overpoweringly full of orange zest and other citrus skin with a bit of mango and other tropical fruits in the background.

314,"2011-06-09",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Mango and pineapple allusions proliferate in this magnificent Double IPA, leading to a sustained resinous bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam lays atop the hazy honeyed yellow.
-There might be more complexity in Abner, but this single-hop Double IPA is just as exciting to drink, over and over again.
-As usual for HFarmstead, the big, soft bubbles and lean residual sugars make this immensely drinkable despite the flavor intensity. 
-Malts offer lenient caramel passages, but these mostly serve the bouncing tropical fruit.
-This is a superb supplement to the Hill Farmstead Double IPA family, but Abner is so constantly impressive that I will find it difficult to migrate away from it.

314,"2011-05-30",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2012 On tap at Hill Farmsteads first anniversary celebration. Hazy golden pour with a massive white head. The nose held every type of citrus incarnation ever imagined. Orange, orangepeel, lemon, lemon peel, and grapefruit. A nice floral resin complemented this nicely. The flavor held the same citrus onslaught, with a light caramel malt that provided excellent balance. Dankly thick palate with a resinous finish.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
314,"2011-05-29",4.0,"On tap at Hill Farmsteads 1st Anniversary. Pretty hazy orange-copper pour with a good sized head. Aroma and flavor both hold tremendous notes of pink grapefruit, orange zest, pine resin, and floral notes. Palate is delightfully drinkable for 8%. Different but comparable in drinkability to Abner, and on the same level in overall quality. Delicious.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
