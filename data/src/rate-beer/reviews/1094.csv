A very nice perry. Mouthfeel is nicely soft and juicy and as the name would suggest, its quite dry. Finishes is lightly sour/acidic, with some stemmy pear fruit characters. very refreshing, liked it a lot.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
1094,"2006-11-03",3.5,"Perhaps a bit too cold. Aroma is harcore oak, a bit of underrip hard pears and something slightl;y pear drop about it. Taste is similar and dry as fuck almost catches in the mouth however this stuff punished me to a silly level last nite, ended up in a random bar on the way home tried to talk to a gay guy who works in a bar across the road from my own and for some reason he told me to fuck off and wouldnt listen to what i had to say the fuckin wanker!","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"
1094,"2006-07-11",3.4,"Cask at Merton Beer Festival, Oxfordshire, July 7th and 8th 2006. Very pale in colour almost white slightly cloudy. Sweeter than I was expecting but with a definate sharpness to it. Some pears present in the aroma and this really is dangerously drinkable, still not quite as good as the Dunkertons Breakwell Seedling and Med Dry but very nice indeed.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

1094,"2005-12-11",2.7,"From the barrel at GBBF, August 2005. Hazy, pale gold colour. The aroma is soft and fruity. On the palate its distinctly sweet and rather soft. Could do with a bit more acidity. An easy drinker for sure, but a bit too soft for my liking.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1094,"2005-09-16",3.6,"Farmy, musty pear aroma.  Light yellow blonde body is still and lightly viscous.  Very sweet, fruity, dessert-like flavour.  Alcohol never apparent.  Medium-full body is somewhat sticky.  Barrel sampled at GBBF 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
1094,"2004-09-19",3.5,"Cask at Merton Beer Festival 04. Cloudy white colour. If I thought the cider was good from this producer, the Perry is even better, it has a farmy nose but then a dry acidity cut through with pear sweetness. Full flavoured but easy drinking, very very nice.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
