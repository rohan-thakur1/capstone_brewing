4180,"2015-10-25",3.5,"12 oz bottle shared by ebone1988. The pour is a dark brown with a thin cap of light tan head and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is pretty chocolatey. There is a nice dry roasted malt and a pretty heavy metallic tendency. There isn't a lot of other notable things going on. The flavor is surprising. There is a good chocolate and a nice malt profile. The metallic is there a little bit, but it's not as prominent as the nose. There is a dry roast that pops up about half way through. The mouth feel is decently creamy with a soft velvety carbonation and a lingeringly chocolatey aftertaste. I actually think I like the aftertaste better than the actual taste, but it's good

4180,"2015-07-24",4.0,"Anchor Bock is one of those brews thats eluded me for a long time. Well, no longer. Bock was tonights pizza beer. Rich, German-style beer and salty, cheesy pizza is a combination I love. Anchor Bock was perfect for the fare. It poured brown with off-white bubbles up top. Aroma was full, rich, and fruity. Flavor had lots of devilishly tasty malty stuff. Chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, and caramel. The barley and wheat created a lot of sweetness, yet this beer managed to not be cloying. While its a big beer, Bock was balanced and smooth. Anchor, its been too long since weve done something new together. Lets get together again soon, yes?","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Aroma is coffee, hint of toffee and roasted malt. Taste is roasted malt sweetness leading to a dry, yet balanced finish. Malty sweetness lingers on the pallet leaving you yearning for the end of the bottle. Anchor beer has a little bit of a spruce hit for me in almost all of their malt-forward efforts.

4180,"2014-11-17",3.1,"April 10th, 2013 - Picked up a six pack of these during a Trader Joes run, and have been slowly making my way through them since. Theyre a fine end of day refresher, but just barely the kind of beer I can treat myself to at the end of a hard day. The body is dark, or too dark to catch any light through, and the head is a cork-like thick body of foam. Once this dies down, the aroma the Anchor Bock gives off is fresh malt, like the smell of a brewery on kilning day, and grainy, but not much more is detectable. The flavor is defined by the body, which is heavily carbonated, though the mid-taste brings some clarity and a dry, milk chocolate edge, and a curious chèvre tanginess. It gets drier as it goes, and the flavors crash a little bit, with the tang being the schoolyard bully, and getting along poorly with the grain-bladed flavors and touches of roasted nuts.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

A fair amount of flavor also. Feels light oily in the mouth and it soft and gentle on the carbonation. Caramelly darkness, a roasted hints. Theres also some licorice here.

4180,"2014-07-25",4.1,"Interesting Californian seasonal, one of the younger beers in the Anchor range and one of the few American bocks Ive had so far. Tanned, regularly shaped, dense and stable foam, very dark brown, clear colour with a copper-reddish hue. Herbally sweet aroma, the kind that makes me melt, with impressions of cacao powder, milk chocolate, freshly ground coffee beans, cinnamon, ginger, caramel, banana, liquorice, raisins and citrussy American hops. Taste begins caramelly and chocolatey, very malty, soft and sweetish with a slight sourish impression from the wheat malt, then quickly becoming assertively bitter with lots of mouth-filling, coffee-like toastedness as well as fresh, green, citrussy and spicy hops, long. The typically American hoppiness made it more stout-like than truly bock-like, I think, but being true to style becomes less important in a great beer like this, at least to my taste.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

4180,"2014-05-12",3.9,"Bottle.
Appearance: The body is very dark when not seen through light, but put into view with a light source behind it the body glows a vibrant garnet hue, truly a beautiful color. The head towers over the body, at tall as the body is deep with excellent head retention and a tan hue. Stellar appearance
Aroma: The aroma leans sweet and malty with a nutty edge to it and a fruitiness, like a baby Troegenator. The fruitiness reminds me of raspberries.
Taste: Very well done bock here. The sweetness is kept in check by a hint of hop bitterness and a prominent raspberry fruitiness, but not a pungent raspberry flavor sort of watered down. A hint of caramel sweetness lingers with a slight burnt edge to it.
Palate: Moderately dense body with mild to moderate carbonation.
Overall: This is something that I would buy a lot if it were available for a cheaper price. $10.99 doesnt make me want to run and grab it for a six pack though. This is very nicely done though, a really good example of a bock.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Expected strong maltiness.. some toasty notes.. nothing stellar.. but pretty standard none the less.

Flavor is a little better than the nose.. more melanoidin than toasty this time around.. bitterness is just enough to balance the malts.. body is medium with medium/low carbonation.. a little bit of drying cocoa emerges as it warms.. still very clean in both the nose and palate.

Flavour is plums, dates, earth hops, light bitterness, grainy. Mouthfeel is nice and dry after a lot of sweetness in the aroma and initially up front. This really is a great beer and is closest to a doppelbock, however it just doesnt have enough body.

4180,"2014-03-07",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2014 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. First aromas off the pour are grass, cookie dough, candy sugar, a light note of berries, and a mild chocolate and vanilla combination. As it settles, some notes of caramel show up and the berries turn more towards raisin and fleshy fruit. A light coffee note comes in towards the end of the drink The pour is a rich dark, caramel-cola color with a large, puffy brown head that has a muffin-like look to it. It slowly reduces down to a messy, but abundant, frothy, lumpy head that leaves an above average amount of splotchy lacing. A medium malty sweetness is matched by a more full, but mellow, light bitter, with a background sourness in very trace amounts (sour grapes came to mind). The beer has medium-light body, with a thin, somewhat creamy texture and a decent amount of very soft, pillowy carbonation. The mouthfeel starts out with a rich chocolate milk flavor, then turns to a  strong, but mellow spruce-like bitterness that fades by the the middle of the sip, and more sweet chocolate malt / malted milk ball and a light sour grape flavor swells in to take its place. Theres also a seltzer-esque mutedness to the drink. A mellow bitter dryness shows up at the finish in the form of resin-y coffee grounds with dark chocolate and is complimented by a milky sweet berries and cream and vanilla bean flavor. The aftertaste is over-toasted bread (not quite burnt, but close) in moderate strength and length.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Lovely ripe plum, figs & port notes very fruity with dark malts. Medium bodied with a silky mouthfeel. The flavor is fruity cherry & berries, quite sweet with caramel & roasty malts in the finish.

Clear with a beige head that is small and recedes quickly to cover.Sweet caramel and biscuity malt notes in the nose are quite clean and straightforward, with a touch of herbal/spicy hops lending a bit of dryness. Light vanilla, cream, honey and melanoidin malt notes emerge as it warms and I dont find any DMS or other flaws. Alcohol is well-concealed, aroma strength is medium.Rich and malty, though not overly sweet or underattenuated, the maltiness takes on a slightly grainy or washed-out character as it warms and the beer breathes, in part due to the filtration, Im sure, but perhaps due to the attenuation. Some molasses-like sweetness is left on the finish along with some slightly bitter herbal hop notes. The malt flavor is pretty spot-on for the style though, any other shortcomings aside. Biscuits, melanoidins, caramel, light vinousness; its all here. Perhaps a touch too astringent after its warmed fully, with a dull sort of brown sugar-like sweetness sitting on the finish.

Comments: This American take of Dunkler Bock is very well made and just right in many aspects: slightly sweet, Dunkel nose is here but inoffensive to me, strong nuttyness, and right amount of chocolate, coffee, creaminess and booziness. Highly enjoyable, and if its taste can be a bit more sweet, it will be perfect. Highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Pours a very dark brown, almost black... the head is big and khaki and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is burnt marshmallows, but in a rich... inviting... appetizing sort of way. Some nice roasty malt and some chocolate play in there as well... am I smelling a smore? 

The flavor is nicely roasty... but its got that rich malty bockyness and some pleasant herbal as well as leafy hop character. Certainly some toasted (as opposed to burnt) marshmallow flavors are enjoyable as the beer is not overly sweet or cloying, but most defiantly on the sweet side of things.

Taste: Light bitterness, caramelly sweet that comes on in the middle and end.  Some roasty/nuttiniess.
Palate:Medium light body, faint fizz that isnt overpowering.
Summary: A lot of flavor in a beer that is only 5.5%. Enjoyable beer that is a malty alternative for spring that is somewhat light despite its looks.","Maryland, USA","jcos"

Taste: Heavily toasted bread crusts, a sip of watered down, stale coffee, and a lone drop of molasses. Not much sweetness present. Very slight estery fruitiness, almost an incredibly faint tartness present as well. Leafy, lightly earthy hops with enough bitterness to balance, which isnt much. Earthy, toasted nut finish.

Filed under: Beer Reviews  Leave a comment
April 8, 2012

Anchor Bock Beer is a 5.5% ABV Dunkler Bock by style brewed at Anchor Brewing in San Francisco, California. A Dunkler Bock is a typically copper to dark brown lager with nutty and toasted flavors and typically no hop taste or aroma.

Pouring out a dark somewhat opaque brown with bright amber highlights in the body and a thick foamy beige head. The foam disperses quickly as steady carbonation cascades upwards in the body and rests as a thin bubbly cap. The nose has sweet caramel and toasty malts with nutty aromas. There is no hop present in the aroma, but I do notice light floral and yeast based fruit notes. An overall sweet and light aroma.

The first sip I took got mostly toasted malts, light chocolate and a hint of underlying sweetness. Not too much going on mid palate, but the finish has a caramel richness and a light floral yeast. Like in the aroma, I get no hop presence in the taste.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"

Mouthfeel is great, with perfect carbonation and that body I was just talking about. Drinkability is awesome, dont see any end to me drinking this if I had a six pack on me right now. Love it.","California, USA","madvermin"
4180,"2011-01-29",3.4,"Bottle. Deep dark brown colored in appearance with dense beige head. The aroma is a blend of butterscotch, toffee and toasted malt. The taste is mostly roasted malt and coffee in addition to caramel, toffee and lemon citrus toward the end. The finish is dry and roasty with a slight malt aftertaste. Its overall flavor is definitely a unique interpretation of the Bock style and is almost closer to a Stout or a Porter.","Seattle, Washington, USA","CampesinoTino"

12oz pours a clear brown with a perfect-sized foamy khaki head that condenses to a dense little ring.  Aroma is a wacky mix of toffee, butterscotch, and sweet flowering berries.  Once it hits the tongue, a nice beefy backbone of malts carries the brew and most of the toffee/butterscotch sweet smells fade away.

The beer really smells like bread; theres even a bakers yeast flavor lurking. The flavor is a bit sweet for my taste, but its far from bad.

Pours a pretty clear dark ruby-chestnut color with a large tan head and good lacing.  This sure is a ""dunkel"" one.  Aroma is really excellent: caramel, chocolate, and toffee, as well as dark fruit (raisin) notes.  Complex.  Flavor is also nice.  Dark fruits - caramel and plum - are present, as well as chocolate, toffee, roast, and a little booze.  Medium-bodied with a smooth mouthfeel, very clean.

The flavor is dry and a touch acidic, with a dark roasted and almost tart finish that has a toasty chocolate malt touch.   There is some almost burnt bread and berry up front, but just a modest sweetness.   This is some very attenuated stuff.   Hops are mild in flavor and are mostly just noticeable in a medium finishing bitterness that is accentuated by the dryness.

Dark ruby-brown, almost black, clear with rich foamy light tan lacing head. Medium-heavy watery body, not quite oily, with medium carbonation and light acidic fizz. Starts surprisingly dry for the aroma. Actually quite a shock in some ways, as the really sweet notes in the nose made me expect a doppelbock sweetness. However, the sweet taste was not found, but rather a tart carbonic acid and fruity acidity is here, with mild astringency and hop bitterness. Smoky and burnt malt, and a soda water tang.

4180,"2010-02-02",3.7,"12oz bottle. Aroma: raisins, molasses, hints of chocolate, caramel toffee, slight vinous fruit, hints of almost savory roasted grain character, and soft alcohol. Appearance: deep dark brown and ruby red, brilliantly clear. Medium-sized tan head that fades to a persistent ring and leaves spots and short streaks of lace on the glass. Taste starts a little more watery than aroma would indicate. Starts bready and grainy, with very subtle hints of sour/acidic fruit, lots of fruit-cakey malts, some dry roasty malt flavors, and a mild malt sweetness. At mid-palate, light-to-moderate slightly earthy but mostly neutral hop bitterness balances the bready, toasty, molasses malt notes. Beer finishes moderate - neither dry nor full - with some malt sweetness and a grainy and slightly roasty aftertaste. Mouthfeel: full-bodied and slippery with growing creaminess as the suds swirl around the mouth. Carbonation is somewhat light, but provides a pleasant texture. Overall: a very decent brew with a complex malt character. But it doesnt taste like a Bock - not enough malt richness (melanoidins, caramel, sweetness) and a little too much roasted grain character.

Additional notes, having had the draft version (Free Trade Inn, Newcastle) - very old ale-like, I did think of Marstons Owd Rodger in its heyday, at first!

A tall column of beige foam is quick to dissipate, leaving wet flares of lacing to break apart and dry as hard spots. The nose is inviting, dark, malty, fruity underpinnings being accompanied by hints of cocoa, nutmeg, clove and orange peel. Fig and raisin comprise the bulk of the sweetness. Flavors follow suit, but delve even deeper. Traces of coffee and tobacco join the fig, raisin, and spice, with zesty orange peel and cocoa working nicely within the mix. Medium bodied, smooth, and highly drinkable, the finish features concentrated cocoa and woody, earthy spice.

Bocks can be terribly boring, but this one grabs you and takes you on an exciting ride!  A rich, dark aroma, almost like worcestershire sauce, emanates from this brew.  Normally, that kind of aroma signals a poorly-executed beer, usually one that is too sour.  But there is barely any sourness in the flavour!  And it is also, thankfully, not too sweet or too heavy!  There is a fair amount of alcohol in the aroma, which I normally dont like, but in the case of this beer it blends well with the other things going on.  Theres a rich maltiness...and a very dry aftertaste.  Overall, it is quite smooth, yet complex.  Outstanding!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured an extremely dark brownish red. It looked brown until held to the light, where it glowed red with an average-sized, kind of creamy, light tan head that mostly lasted and left excellent and thick lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy roasted and burnt malt, light herbal hops, soy sauce, spices, a little dark fruit and light milk chocolate malt. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, acidic and bitter; while the finish was light to moderately sweet and bitter, lightly acidic and then sour right at the end with an average duration. There was tons of roasted and burnt malts with a hint of coffee and a little tiny bit of dar, sour fruit. Some soy sauce too. The medium to full body was creamy with somewhat soft carbonation and a moderate to heavy astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Aroma of strawberries & lemon.  Flavor is much less sweet than most dark bocks. In fact, sweetness plays a marginal role in the set of flavors. Sour cherry, chocolate, burned toast, and citric hops are the main flavors, with a touch of dark toffee in the first third.  The acidic quality does not feel like a bock, nor does the porter-like espresso bean roast.

The aroma is of Raisinets, light malted milk, Root Beer Barrels (the hard candy). and a faint, fruity hop note. Medium-bodied and slick with a soft mouthfeel that quickly asserts its carbonation upon swallowing, wrapping your tongue in a cascade of tiny bubbles. The finish is quick with just a hint of hop bitterness and metal coming through. The flavor is surprisingly more complex than the nose.

Herbiness with light plum and tobacco, slight roast.  This is like no German Bock Ive had, and despite the appreciable complexity and craftsmanship, not even an offering Id like to have again.  Sharp, angular, and hard. [2.7]After a few more bottles, Ive come to love its dryness and its grit, but the mild fruitiness is not particularly becoming and the mild sharpness is misplaced.  Long-lasting, extremely earthy hop tone, though, more than makes up for it.  Much more tobacco coming out this time - better warm?  Certainly plummier.

Quite dark, turned sanguine red when exposed to the light.  Very nice sustained half inch of head.

Interesting caramel malts, and as hoppy as a Bock can be.

Plenty of malt body and well dosed carbonation, it does have a bit of a vegetal taste to it, but I didnt really see it as such a bad thing.  Kind of like bitter rhubarb, and the malt sweetness tames the harshness of it.  But its the finish that I didnt like, as it was ashy, something I dont like at all, at least not at this level.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

4180,"2006-08-22",3.3,"Bottle: Pours to a mostly clear (when held to a light) medium brown colored body that shines with ruby highlights.  Atop sits a medium, light brownish tan head that fades to a medium, rocky ring around the outside of the glass.  The aroma shows a slight nuttiness, though its more of a darker, richer, more malty nuttiness than say a brown ale would be.  Theres also a pleasing mild roast scent, biscuit notes, and hints of some plums, carrots, or maybe beats - this smell is not the same as what one would expect from DMS, rather it seems to be coming from the house character of anchors brews (yeast, and I believe unique fermentation tanks?) combined with the choice of malt of hops here.  As it warms, a slight pine scent shows itself.  The taste shows a small hit of bitterness and pine-like hops right off the bat, but thats quickly overcome by grapes, caramel, rich medium malt syrup flavors, caramelized apples, cinnamon-infused, unsweetened chocolate, hints of light allspice, plenty of malt flavors to pick through here.  Medium bodied, medium carbonated, this actually feels almost tart in the mouth and seems to be fairly dry overall.  It does seem to be a little too bitter for what Id like in a Bock, but thats really nitpicking for a well-brewed beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

The nose on this beer is very nice, with aromas of sweet malt, light toast, and nutty malt aroma. The palate is firm, with good sweet malt, toasty and nutty malt flavor.

4180,"2006-05-09",3.5,"Really interesting one here. Poured this into my new Alesmith tulip glass. Probably the darkest bock Ive ever poured, it was a dark brown body with a fairly sizable head. Aroma reminded me a lot of Alesmiths Wee Heavy. Chocolate, caramel, some darker fruits. Really drinkable and enjoyable... and maybe it was because it was the last of the day, but this reminded me of a lighter version of Wee Heavy.

4180,"2006-05-09",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2007 Bottled.  A dark brown coloured beer with a tan coloured, fairly thin head.  The actual appearance is quite murky.  The aroma has sweet notes with some malty coffee and a fair dosage of hops.  The taste has caramel and licquorice and yet more hops.  There are big flavours, some of which you would never find in a German bock and the whole entity seems a little unbalanced.

I hope they were enjoyed.  Sweet, sugary chocolate aroma with some metallic aromas as well.  Some grassy hops are also detected.  Mildly transparent dark mahogany color with a nice, frothy light tan head and nice lacing.  Very malt beer with a sweet start, turning a bit toasty with chocolate malts.

Microtrabeculae of very tiny fine bubbles. I get a bit of grape Kool-Ade aroma. The grape popsicle flavor also emerges from the heavily malty body. Medium sweetness. Chocolate and roasted flavors. At mid point, the head and lacing is thin. The finish is a nice tart taste on the sides of the tongue- sort of like a bittersweet chocolate. Id say that Ive tasted this in a previous Christmas beer from Anchor, but without any of the spices. Not very bock-like at all. Much more ale in its palate.

Butter, eggs, mint, Munichy malt and plum sauce. It tastes really roasty, shoving any other flavours into the background (without any indication from the aroma.) I suppose theres a bit of cinnamon and apple pie dough, but its under a mountain of burnt toast. Weird, odd, unusual, interesting and more... A well-made disaster?","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

The palate is dry and dusty with cocoa powder being a dominate flavor in the beer. The head is thick and lasting. The color is quite dark almost black. Overall, a smooth malty beer thats all too easy to drink. However, from a stylistic standpoint I see this beer as a schwarzbier, because of its dark color, dryness, and black/chocolate barley notes.

pours a deep amber with orangish highlights with tan head
Smells of chocolate, roast, some biscuit and a low hop aroma and some chalk and some melanoidin 
Palate: chocolate, chalk, some dry biscuit a little roast with a faint low hop bitterness
Overall: While a little thin for a bock still a very well made beer another winner from  Anchor seems to get more roast astringency as the beer warms up
Definitely still something I pickup every year... maybe the christmas beer I like a lot lot more

2006 review 
Appearance: Dark brown with dark red high lights... pours with a tan head which does not last too long
Aroma: Caramel, bready, chocolate and some faint hoppy notes
Flavor: Smooth, refreshing for a bock, roasty, raisins, with some piney hopy flavors
Palate: For a malty nose, the malt is restrained and finishes surprisingly clean and dry with a resinous hoppy finish
Overall: Another very very good beer from Anchor - definitely worth seeking out. Looks like a bock, smells like a bock and even tastes a lot like a bock... but there  seems to be a little something missing .... I have tried it for 2005 and 2006, I will try it again to see if it changes... so far 2005 was better","USA","luvcasks"

Aroma was initially very strong for a bock, waves of fresh resiny/oily hops, deep sweet roast malt, yeast - it settled down to a pleasant, less aggressive nose after a bit.  The flavour was more what I would expect from a bock - slightly leafy roast caramel malt, with the hops emerging in a moderately long, somewhat appleseed bitter finish.

The flavor is mild and light with a faint background of caramel and lightly roasted malt. Has a notice of hop in the flavor as well but not as apparent as in the aroma.

4180,"2006-02-19",3.8,"An obscure beer along the same lines as the Porter in some of its qualities. In fact a mix of the two may be a good call to harness the better qualities of both. I honestly liked this one. What it lacked in complexity, it made up for in a relentless onslaught on my tastebuds, and I notice Im not the only one to wonder what the bloody ABV is?!! (In a way its good not to know as generally higher ABV beers rate better, so this is merely up to the beers profile!). Poured into a chalice, cool but not cold. Looked outstanding in the glass; deep set ruby body, good clarity, with a thick, creamy beige crown that managed a good trail of thinning lace. Dusty cocoa, aniseed and tart, red fruits in the aroma with a hint of burnt sugar and bitter herbs giving it a little depth. Similar in the mouth with more dark fruits and a strong showing of black patent style charred wood malts. Soft on the tongue; not overly big in the body department but smooth in feel and well rounded in flavour. Cocoa takes a back seat as notes of blackcurrents, raisins and some burnt fruit sugars take hold, giving it a gentle astringency and a bitter edge just prior to the swallow before a deep, drying malt and hops finish. Lingering for a good hour afterwards with smoke and raisins filling the mouth like a burnt Christmas fruit cake, this was quite a different take on the old word Bock. One Im going to try and grab again as long as its available with a little more ease than the round trip from the U.S. to Amsterdam and then onto Perth, Australia. Enjoyable!!! (1 pint/ 6 fl.

The nose is good if not a bit of dried fruitiness with some harsh maltiness. Flavour is potentially fine but there is a degree of wheatiness that detracts from the body as well as contributing an unfavourable harshness in mouthfeel and flavour.

Judging it as a bock it fails in many ways - not sweet enough, too bitter, no butterscotch, totally wrong choice of hops.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
4180,"2005-09-11",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2006 Rerate 4/11/06, aged for roughly a year: Pours a transparent dark mahogany with a large, frothy tan head.  Aroma has changed a lot, resembling more of a doppelbock, and bery authentic with some sweet earthy caramel malt and milk chocolate notes.  Starts with a nice slightly aged caramel malty sweetness with a touch of hoppy bitterness.  Finishes smooth, but somewhat thin.  Still, a very nice bock.

Originally rated on 9/11/05: Lightly transparent dark amber brown pour with a lightly-lacing, frothy off-white head.  Aroma has some earthy milk chocolate and lots of piney hops, that although they make it deviate from the style, add a good amount of balance.  Body starts with a creamy lactose sweetness, some earthy caramel and fresh piney hop flavor.  Seems like a lighter recipe of Old Foghorn.  Very drinkable and flavorful, just not too true to style.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4180,"2005-09-09",3.7,"Bottle bought in the Mitra drinks shop, a  90 seconds walk from the place where I spend my working hours. Dark brown color. Lasting creamy head. Coffee, caramel and chocolate in the aroma. Malty flavor with chocolate, blackcurrant (Cascade hops?), roasted malt, grapes and laurel. Hints of coffee. Medium bodied. Not a bock beer like German or Dutch bocks Ive tasted. Nevertheless a fine and tasty beer.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"

Rich dark chocolate powder and caramel throughout the aroma, accentuated by pecans and walnuts.  Glides across the palate, drawing out brazed walnuts, chocolate and rye.  Rich semi-sweet chocolate morsels and a little hint of smoke.  Dactylically speaking, its a conundrum, but the flavor is solid.  Toffee, Rolo like finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Juicy and grapey at the same time, this is a multi-faceted bock, fairly spicy. The palate did not quite hold up for me, the finish being a bit bland. Nevertheless, the nice coffee-roasty- nutty and dry interplays are pleasant to feel. The body proposes ample maltiness, a fitting light-medium carbonation to cut through the medium airy body. Did not seem to interest me as much as my buddies, but definitely good.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

From what I can tell its a good beer and as per their own description and the way things have gone in general what defines a bock beer has been blurred to a great extent. Had the thought of this being like their porter placed in my brain and that became hard to escape. But I would say for good reason. A bit sweeter than the porter I believe. An excellent beer by any measure. Many thanks to Rich (MrDick)","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
4180,"2005-07-25",3.9,"22 ounce bottle sampled with tiggmtl, Rastacouere and Olivier_MTL at Ashleys in Ann Arbor MI.  Bottle acquired in trade with Irishsnake, thanks so much!  Reddish-dried blood-brown body, creamy lasting small off-white head with just a touch of lacing...herb-infused caramel aroma, woody character and bready yeast appears with time...body is also herbal in character, quite dry for a bock, though thick caramel malts are always present along with bakers chocolate, rye, and I think some aloe...like a bock overlaid with typical Anchor spicy herbal qualities (e.g. OSA, Porter)...probably far from perfect stylistically, but certainly one of the most interesting bocks Ive had lately and more proof if we needed it that the old guys like Anchor and SN can still keep up with the young turks.  Bravo.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

4180,"2005-07-19",3.9,"Chestnut colors with a hint of rudy when held to the light. Two fingers worth of tan foam that is quite lasting. The aroma leads to an impression of a highly malty brew. Sorghum and brown sugar mix with toasted vanilla wafers and roasted nuts. Lightly roasted coffee beans coated in mild dark chocolate. Fairly dry, yet quite full bodied. Mild noble hops bitterness mixes well with a the toasty malt. While I can not say this is the best bock Ive ever had it is certainly a very fine beer. Long linger of malts on the tongue help you remember the malt joy a a good malty brew. I love a malty brew and the flavors continue to intensify as this one warms.

4180,"2005-07-16",4.0,"Bottle discovered at Florians in Truckee, CA.  Thanks for having this!  Clear, but so dark that its opaque unless held up to light.  A unique magenta-red color in more standard indoor lighting.  Topped with a light brown head of creamy carbonation and medium-large in size, this baby can lace!  She does so in medium to thin sheets, completely coating the glass with a head that is fully lasting.  Aroma is yeasty sweet with roasted caramel, honey, fresh baked banana bread when you cut it open, dark fruits, chocolate and a hint of alcohol.  Body is medium with tons of soft, foamy carbonation giving it the allusion of a full body and leaving the mouth pleasantly dry.  Flavor is loaded with dark, roasted and burnt fruits.  Wow!  Malty, but not sweet.  Prune is big, with a tart plumb flavor and a finish of roasted, burned hazlenuts and fruit that is lightly bitter.  Rich chocolate undertones remind me of ""Godiva Belgian Dark"" ice cream.   Well balanced, complex.  Hopefully I can buy more on Tuesday.  Becomes noticably alcoholic as it warms, and somewhat harsh...I had anticipated improvement as it warmed--considering how dark it is--but I was wrong.  Similar to their porter and quite enjoyable.

4180,"2005-06-30",3.7,"Fruity aromatic notes of raisins and figs waft from my glass as I pour this beer.  Pours a deep, dark, amber color that shows ruby notes when held up to the light.  As well as the fruitiness I get notes of chocolate, a hint of lightly spicy hops, toasted malt.  This is really quite interesting in the nose, it is richly malty.  The taste is ever so lightly sweet, it is richly malty compared to the sweetness, which is quite nice.  The beer has notes of chocolate, toasted malt, and dark caramel.  This beer finishes quite dry, with a lightly astringent note of toasted malt that tends to linger a bit.  This note makes you thirsty and ready for another sip.  This beer has a fairly light body to it, at least for a bock, it does have a decent amount of mouthcoating maltiness to it though.  There is a bit of spiciness to this beer that I would attribute to hops, other than this the beer is pretty low on the hopping scale; there is just enough to make sure the malt is not cloying.  This is really quite nice, and is almost a quaffing bock, by which I mean a 22oz bottle is just about the right amount.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
