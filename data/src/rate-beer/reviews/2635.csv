2635,"2012-10-06",3.3,"Actually this is sliiiightly hazy golden and it has a creamy head. The aroma is very mild with notes of fruit, yeast and wheat. The sweet flavor is very mild too, it has notes of fruit, yeast and wheat, and the finish is soft, slightly fruity and dry.","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"
2635,"2012-07-23",3.3,"Bottled. I didnt know what to expect from a weizen with a screw top, but everything turned out quite nice. The beer is yellowish golden in colour and has a mediumsized creamy white head, that leaves some lace. Aroma is wheat, some caramel, toffee, floral notes as well as some mild dry wooden notes. Flavour is being rather similar with also some slight herbal notes added.","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"

2635,"2011-10-25",3.3,"500ml screwcap bottle poured a pale golden color with a small white head and a few spots of lacing.  Aromas of cereal grains and some light hops and a trace of yeast.  Taste is light malty sweetness and a trace of yeast with a mild hoppy finish.  Nice carbonation and adequate body deliver a nice mouthfeel.  A surprisingly refreshing brew suitable for a hot summer day.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
2635,"2010-07-13",3.1,"Very light with fruit aromas that are usually buried under heavier malt aromas. Pours with a nice head that sticks around a while. Pretty good lacing, quite clear, as is the style. Actually a LOT of lacing. The familiar malt flavour comes and goes quickly, cleanly replaced by the fruity flavours from the aroma. The yeast ends things off and lingers on your palate. Not the best tasting end of a beer but it is definatley enjoyable and different. This is my fist Kristallweizen. Im pretty impressed with this one, I know its supposed to be rather thin, I dont mind at all. The Fruity aromas and flavours complement this one quite nicely. I am also quite hungry and waiting for my food, so I imagin a salivatingly clean palate really helps that out. Still, this would be great in the summer heat.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","TheHulk"
2635,"2010-06-23",3.2,"A big bottle twisty cap from Germany, brewed exclusively for Alberta?! (so far all 7 raters for this beer are from Alberta). Anyway. Pours a bright yellow gold with an average white head and lively carbonation throughout the body. sweet clean wheaty aroma. sweet wheaty flavours with hints of light banana and lemon, brought forward even more by the heavy garlic in my homemade ceasar salad. Brisk carbonation lends a refreshing crispness to the palate. Yes, I concede kristallweizens generally dont bring much to the table as a style, but this was the right beer for the right meal on the right occasion. I liked it.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
2635,"2010-05-22",3.4,"500ml brown screw top bottle. Clear golden colour, small white head which collapses to a weak ring. Clove aroma, some banana. Fruity malt taste (pear?), a bit of leafy/grass hop taste in the finish, chalky yeast and minerals. Light body, medium to high carbonation. Not a blockbuster, expected flavours are there. Decently brewed Kristall that could be a nice summer patio beer.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","pintbypint"
2635,"2010-04-17",3.8,"Pours golden yellow with fast vanishing head. Great nose! Banana custard, mint still on the vine, playful hops and just a whisper of wheat. Immediate sweet malt mouth presence moving to soft flowers, wild rice and ending with a mild but full hop presence. Finish and mouth feel is light and faded. Well crafted with superb balance and good chemistry. A light one so take that into consideration.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","Powertrip"
2635,"2010-04-07",2.2,"Bottle. Light gold with a thick porous head. Very thin banana scent. Flavour is artificial banana and aluminum with a harsh lasting finish.  Tastes like a light beer hefe or a gluten free hefe.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
2635,"2010-04-06",2.3,"Pours out a small white cap that simmers to a thin velvety cover and leaves ample 360 degree lacing. The aroma is reminiscent of dry cat food, dull wheat, some yeast... really, this has almost a zero on the appealing scale. I can find the light fruitiness after letting it sit. The flavour isnt that bad - this is a decent, easy drinking light tasting brew. Weak sourness, hint of bitterness near the finish is well placed, dull wheat is the main character, light fruit of no significance. There is a slight spice that comes out much more after sitting - I cant nail it down but its different. Ok mouth swish.. I pretty much slammed the bottom half of the glass so I could move on to scotch.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
2635,"2010-04-01",2.1,"Pours clear and yellow like any pale lager and hasalmost no head. Aroma is sweet and corn like with a very mild wheat aroma. Flavour of wheat and spice but is is dull and weak not much body. Its okay, better than canadian but still pretty weak.",", Alberta, CANADA","Cole"
2635,"2010-02-20",2.4,"Bottle. Pours pale yellow, with a thin white head that quickly reduces to naught. Nose is earthy, with notes of wheat, Ponds cold cream, flowers, very mild, inoffensive. Flavors of adjunct malt, earth, very subtle wheat character. Okay, but really forgettable... dreadful finish.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
