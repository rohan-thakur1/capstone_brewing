Offers a plethora of flavors, mainly coconut, caramel coated vanilla and sweet maple syrup, balanced by earthy malts and bakers chocolate. 

Low on its carbonation, with a thinner mouthfeel to it, gently balancing the Bourbon with a silk layer of cream.

Tastes of milk chocolate, cloying molasses, cocoa nibs and earth. Bourbon, soothed by cream, becomes apparent by a dry coconut alcohol bite, revealing bitter chocolate and rock sugar. Finishes with caramel and a slightly bittercoffee earthiness, featuring a pleasant, sugar coated dryness.

Relying heavily on the barrel, this reveals a lot of awesome Bourbon characteristics among sweeter malts, balanced by a bitter dryness. A little thin as for its mouthfeel, while providing a great creaminess.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The pour is a nice black, thick and oily, with a small ring of dark khaki colored head that lasted the entire time. The aroma on this is pretty heavy on the bourbon. There is a brown sugar sweetness that accompanies some light molasses as well. Chocolate is also present with a nice roasty malt and some light vanilla. I wanted this one to have a lot more maple to it than it had. The flavor is very similar. There is a nice bourbon heat up front again, and this time there is a light maple present, but some of the other flavors suffer. There is a nice chocolate, some oak, and maybe a touch of vanilla. The booziness kind of dominates the back end. The mouth feel is viscous and oily. Nice and thick with a great soft carbonation and a lingeringly boozy, lightly sweet aftertaste.

1495,"2015-05-22",4.0,"On tap at the pub. Pour is black with a tight tan head that never leaves. Nose is rich, a good bit of bourbon up front, sweet, tons of maple, malts dont shine through as much as you would hope but nose is powerful and didnt smell overly sugary. A good bit of toffee and some melted caramel. Taste is solid, lots of rich bourbon and maple, malts are more present, definitely sweet but seems fairly well attenuated. The style is going to breed a sweeter beer. Malts are rich, caramel and chocolate, body thins a bit in the finish, carb is very gentle. Soft feel and very creamy.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

1495,"2015-04-20",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a deep mahogany, nearly but not quite black, with just a centimeter of burnt caramel head that fades quickly to a small ring of lacing. Aroma is very rich and complex with vintage bourbon, caramel, brandy, port, raisin, maple sugar, figs, bitter chocolate, mild boozy heat, and oak. Seems more in the old ale/barleywine category to me as opposed to imperial porter/stout. Taste unfortunately does not quite live up to the nose, with bourbon, caramel, raisin, and chocolate-covered cherry giving way to red licorice, ash, prune juice, sugar syrup, and sherry. A fairly light and thin mouthfeel  lighter and thinner than desirable  puts this in the porter camp. Very good but not great, aroma is the best part.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
1495,"2015-03-23",4.2,"This beer pours pitch black with a medium thin beige head that diminishes steadily to a film. Strings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of oak, roast malt and vanilla.

1495,"2015-02-18",4.5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. No freshness date printed on label. 2014 bottling.

Appearance: Pours a cola brown, almost black, with a 1/2 finger mocha brown head which fades slowly leaving a ring around the edge of the glass which eventually fades into a headless pool of flat cola. No lacing. Swirling the glass brings out some alcohol legs.

Smell: Cocoa, vanilla and bourbon dominate with roasted malt, a nice nuttiness, dried fruit, molasses and a hint of alcohol.

Taste: Medium roasted malt, sweet chocolate and a touch of maple syrup up front followed by molasses, vanilla and bourbon in the middle before ending with just a touch of toasted malt, a bit more maple sweetness and a bit of alcohol at the finish. Aftertaste is sweet with just a little bitterness. The alcohol comes through stronger as it warms up.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. There is a mild alcohol burn as it goes down due to the ABV. 

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. Goes down exceptionally smooth for a beer with an ABV of 11%.

Overall: Excellent beer overall. While its labeled as an American Porter here on BA and as an Imperial Porter by Jackie Os, its really an American Double / Imperial Stout. Whatever you call it, its damn near perfect. I would very highly recommend this one if you get the chance to try it.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

1495,"2014-10-31",4.1,"Great inviting aroma of chocolate and the right amount of bourbon. On aroma alone, this is fantastic. Mouthfeel is great as well. Thick and velvety with a decent carbonation. Somewhat viscous feeling. Flavor is very good, if plain. Nothing stands here out as unique and ninjas trouble finding the maple. However, the bourbon is very well integrated and the whole beer has a certain finesse, confidence, and ease of execution. Don't expect anything mind blowing here, but be satisfied with something exceptionally crafted.","","Beardaxe"

1495,"2014-09-27",4.3,"Bottle from Joe. Big time thanks! Pours dark brown as it comes out of the bottle, but settles pretty pitch black in the glass with a very small, quickly receding dark brown head. Awesome and super sweet aroma of chocolate and bourbon, vanilla, roasted marshmallow, sweet maple, caramel, toffee. Flavor is a beautiful meld of sweet vanilla and bourbon, oak, more bourbon, some caramel, marshmallow, extra sweetness that I assume is maple, though that flavor is not particularly present. The bourbon flavors are very mellow here, despite it having a body very much on the thinner side for being barrel aged. Its so well integrated, though, that it doesnt really take away much from the beer. Medium prickle on the carbonation, long finish of vanilla, caramel, oak, and bourbon. Really, really nice. Still do wish it had a bit more body. But the flavors meld so nicely.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
1495,"2014-09-24",3.9,"Draft at Jackie-Os on the brewpub side. Pours a deep brown with a small tan head that leaves a ring and some film atop the beer. Plenty of maple here, with vanilla, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, earth, tobacco, and a little toast and roast. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel that coats before drying. Just a wee bit too sweet on the nose for me, but otherwise this is pretty darn good. Now I have to open a bottle at home.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1495,"2014-08-22",4.8,"375ml bottle, 2014 vintage. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that fizzled away quickly. Theres a small amount of lacing. Aroma is amazing, the brew smells like maple, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and roasted malt. The taste is mostly sweet and mapley. It tastes like maple, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is full, its coating and creamy with low/moderate carbonation. The 11% ABV is well hidden in this brew, it doesnt seem like Im drinking something that strong at all! This is definitely one of the best beers Ive drank in a while. Hopefully theyre aging more of this down in Athens right now, because it would be a shame if this was just a one time brew.

1495,"2014-08-05",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2015 12.7oz bottle. Big thanks to jstax for leaving this one for me! Man, after reading the deScription on the bottle and seeming the label (the most Jackie-Os-est label for distro yet), I have to say I am extremely excited for this beer. Pretty much black color. Thin ring of off-white / khaki head, pretty much minimal. A couple dots of lace. Nose and flavor have a little more raw graininess than expected. Dark chocolate, chocolate syrup. Some maple syrup. Moderate bitter taste. Moderate sweet... But what dominates is the big alcohol bite. Theres a moderate alcohol burn on this, and a sort of boozy spiciness in the finish. Bigger body. Smooth, kind of crisp lighter carbonation. Light slick finish. Nice chewiness to the texture. Alright stuff, in the end... Just unfortunately much boozier than expected. An unnecessary burn that dominates the palate. Beyond that, theres a nice maple / dark chocolate mild roast flavor to it. Bourbon kind of harshes the overall vibe, though. I wanted to love this, but Im a little let down. Maybe this will get better with age? I thought it would be magical enough to chief on my own, but I regret now not sharing it. A little more difficult to drink than expected. 8/3/6/4/13 Update, 11/6/15: 2015 Bottle shared with friends. Near-black color. thin ring of khaki head. Some loose bits of lace. Great maple, dark chocolate, some mild roast malt coffee notes. Bit of bourbon vanilla, big oak. Definitely a big bourbon note, but not as harsh as I remember, nor sweet. Maybe better to share, now. Moderate to bigger sweet taste, but not cloying at all. Good moderate bitter too, but not like an imperial stout. More creamy, kind of milky. Certainly in imperial porter territory. Bigger body, kind of chewy. Light carbonation. More dry finish. Delicious one to share. I think I went for more sips than others.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
