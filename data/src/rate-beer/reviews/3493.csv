Comments: I was not particularly enthusiast about this one when getting a small sample, but I had a half-pint at the 3-legged-mare in York and it was in awesome condition. I think it may have been my favourite cask ale ever, or close. Marvellously crisp, dense, almost chewy dark malts bursting with delicious toastiness.

Deep ruby red, still and sparkling in the lights topped off with a thin, tannish pad of cream that retained well and had a similar high sheen sparkle. Woody aged fruit nose, tangy but dry with a light peppery spice. Quite pleasant. Smoky and rich burnt fruits in the mouth. Quite full and creamy with a light hint of cherry sweetness upfront before drying out and showing an array of spicy, aged fruits, dark chocolate, peat and woody malts with a touch of roasted coffee beans. Burnt wood and bitter malts finish it off smoothly and the length the flavour lasts on the palate is divine. I really took a shine to this one. Its not too intense, but it borderlined on session beer and one for quiet contemplation. A lovely, balanced, malt driven ale.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
