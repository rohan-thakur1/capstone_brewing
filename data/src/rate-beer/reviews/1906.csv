1906,"2017-05-26",4.0,"{From 2011 notes}
12 oz bottle dated ""best by"" 3/2011 served in pint glass. Very small amount of sediment added mid-tasting. 

pours a clear copper with a moderate off-white head. Head has good retention.

This is a relatively hoppy APA that also has a robust malt base. High caramel component in both the aroma and flavor. Bold and crisp with excellent finish. The flavor is rich and a little earthy. Excellent sweet/bitter balance, with a mildly bitter close and aftertaste. Taste rating approaches 4.5.

O: This is about as good as an APA gets. Super choice to introduce macro-lager drinkers to a more flavorful craft beer or to prepare PA drinkers for an IPA.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

This was poured into a pint glass. 
The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was somewhat all around as it didnt really show much uniformity towards the glass. It just kind of went all over the place. 
The smell had a decent amount of light piney hops that seemed to fade as the beer went down. The malts seemed to increase as the beer warmed up. 
The taste acted the same way.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to somewhat medium. The carbonation seemed to be fairly well done as there was just enough harshness but still an inviting smoothness to round it all out.

1906,"2014-04-28",3.7,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a mug. It came as part of a mix pack for $15.99 ($1.33 per bottle or $0.11 per ounce). 

Appearance: Surprisingly dark brown with a honey glow. Hazy with carbonation initially present. Pours to a small, white, foamy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Slightly fruity scent, but distinctly malty. A hint of hops. 

Taste: Not too many American breweries do an English-style pale ale, and those that do dont tend to do them too well. While Smuttynose Shoals Pale Ale may not be an exact authentic replica of a British brew, its most definitely not American, either. The malts are actually the star of the show, here, though theres still plenty of hop character you expect in a pale ale.

Up front I notice a sweet malt flavor with notes of toast, muffins and orange marmalade. The hops are present as well, but dont reveal themselves until the finish. The beer has a consistent slightly dry bitterness throughout, which really complements the darker malt flavor. Perhaps a hint of citrus from the hops can be detected, which is nice. A mild bitter bite as it goes down keeps the palette well-balanced and interesting. Its not Fullers, but itll do.

Drinkability: The pale ale is supposed to be overtly drinkable, especially compared to the IPA, and Smuttynose Shoals Pale Ale definitely succeeds in this aspect. The mouthfeel is perfectly medium all around. Robust enough flavor to keep it interesting, but still crisp and smooth to make it easy to quaff down. This beer weighs in at 5.6% ABV, which seems just about right (maybe a tad high). A little too big to session, but strong enough to enjoy as a standalone serving.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The taste was immediately astringent, a little watery, and lighter bodied than I wouldve expected, considering the hefty nose. Included was some tartness, and a hop bitterness that was very earthy, rindy, dry, and lingering.

Smell: The aroma has an inviting mix of sweet bready and light caramel maltiness with solid citrus and herbal leafy spicy hops.

Taste/Palate: There is a good solid hop character with nice crisp citrus and spicy notes laid over a study foundation of bready malt that matches the bitterness from the hops. There is a touch of caramel sweetness in there as well. The finish is long and slow with a good balance of hops and malt.

And now back to the beer at hand. She shimmers in a sea of crystal clear coppery depths with glints of amber and garnet where the light fractures her body. Her itsy bitsy puffy white head fades into a paper-thin film. As her head bows out, her nose steps onto center stage and demands attention. Crisp and hoppy followed by an array of sweet breads and grainy mats. Giving her a crisp presence are fresh lemons, apples, peaches, and oranges with a healthy sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. Her cinnamon and spice come into play once more as she gathers all her crunchy toasted bread crusts, dip them lightly into honey, and sprinkles some of moms cinnamon sugar on top. Aromatically enticing and balanced, but will her main performance be able to hold up? She steps forward with brisk assurance which I find highly refreshing. Spices up front with the crunchy sweetness of her toasted and honey-dipped crust lead smoothly into bitter citric esters on the top of my tongue which hints of lemon skin. Unlike her initial pour, lace begins to leave their mark along the sides of my glass with each draining quaff. As she warms and we grow ever more intimate, a hint of maple is added to the fray, while her fresh baked breads add a pleasant meatiness which is balanced by her crisp hop presence. Not to be forgotten, crunchy apples, fresh pears, and succulent oranges weave in and out from start to finish. As her performance draws to a close, I call for an encore.


A solid English Pale Ale from Smuttynose and definitely one of the better I have tasted as of late. The English Pale Ale can be an over-produced style that can blur the palate from brewery to brewery in terms of taste and style. It is always nice to come into one that brings a bit of life back into a somewhat old, tired horse. A great session brew and an easy recommendation, Im glad the Smuttynose Pale Ale is now a regular staple in Florida.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Darker malt (crystal) in flavor is the initial taste. This is followed by a strong bitterness that intensifies after the swallow. The beer is thick; coats the palate.

There is a noseful of spicy hoppiness that hits right away. A solid toasted malt presence is met with a touch of caramel and lays down a nice foundation. The hops are more prominent than I expected. A spicy hoppiness leads the way but is followed by grassy and floral notes. Every now and then I pick up hints of orange peel which adds another dimension to an already good smelling brew.

The flavor follows the nose closely. A good spiciness kicks things off and leads from beginning to end with the floral and orange qualities showing up mid palate. The grassiness comes about here and there but never in the same spot. All this over is shown over the top of a respectable toasted maltiness with a drizzling of caramel. This is a good beer from Smutty.

The mouthfeel is right where it should be with this beer. Medium bodied with a solid enough carbonation to keep things moving but does show a little stick on the swallow. Finishes a bit dry which accentuates the bitterness which is right down my alley.

This glass is going down very easily and I actually wish I had a few more in the fridge. A solid example of a pale ale on the hoppy side of the spectrum. Very nicely done!

Shoals Pale Ale is a high quality beer. To be perfectly honest I didnt expect a whole lot from this beer and I am pleasantly surprised. I enjoy my pale ales on the hoppier side of the spectrum and this one hits the spot. Thanks again Israel!

sensory first impression: Lighter than even the Old Brown Dog ale by Smuttynose, and seemingly even more tame. Not my kind of beer, but I know some who would love it. Not very hoppy - smooth like water. Bright white head hangs on for a few. Tea colors and murky with nice sediment, if you like that sort of thing. I like it as a change of visual pace. Its another tea like brew from Smutty.

Aroma/Olfactory:
Malt flavor is: malty, nutty, and roasted. Malt has a bit of linger.
Hop flavor is: missing. Really very little in way of bitterness or hops here. After a moment, some bitterness arrives, but not enough to cheer.
Yeast flavor is: muddy, earthy, and dusty.
Other flavors include: grapefruit and other citrus hints.

Visuals/Appearance:
Color is: pale reddish brown, murky and tea like.
Liquid is: hazy, dark, and cloudy.
Head and lace are: bright white, and much more impressive than in SNs Old Brown Dog Ale. Lace is running strong, with nice legs.

Taste/Flavor:
Maltiness or Sweetness level is: medium
Hoppiness or Bitterness level is: light
Sour level is: none

Palate/Tactile:
Body or Mouthfeel is: too light
Texture is: thin and smooth.
Carbonation is: flat
Finish is: abrupt and unsatisfying.

Overall experience: Not bad, but nowhere near great. Rather disappointing, especially after having their IPA, which is surprising and delicious. About average or below for American styled craft beers.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

The flavor, as it hit my tongue, I thought was going to be really, really good.  The sweetness and the maltiness never really developed. . .leaving me wanting more of both.  The hops were indistinguishable under the bitter finish.  Very little taste from the hops (again leaving me wanting more), just a bitter finish.

I guess for me it really suffers the ""plain jane"" fate because while there were no flaws, it just didnt impress me enough to consider this beer anything more than ""just another beer"". The beer pours out a nice copper/amber color, solidly built head and an aroma of light flowers and some citrus zing. The problem I had was...wheres the flavors? I mean, with the aroma it was telling me that I might get a decent APA here, but it just didnt deliver no matter how much it warmed up. Sure there was some faint, soft caramel malts and some lifeless citrus hop bitterness but it was on life support. A ho-hum beer for sure. Next!","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

1906,"2008-01-14",3.4,"Pours dark amber with a hint of rust and a one finger head that dissapates into a film. Aroma was predominantly hops, of the grapefruit and lemon variety. Flavor was also largely dominated by hops, with a little malt sneaking in there. Hops had just a little too much bite on them, I feel like it would suit this beer better if they mellowed out and left space for other facets of flavorl.

Decent head with same lacing. Amber/reddish color. Light-to-medium body with some fizziness. A relatively easy drinking beer with some decent hops to it. Im not a hop fiend myself, so I think it was about right. 

Re-rate: wow, this is better than I remember. Nice bready backbone, nice citrus hops (Chinook and Cascades, according to the website). Slightly bitter finish.","Rochester, New York, USA","McGarnigle"
1906,"2007-07-08",3.7,"Poured from bottle.  Looks like most other pale ales, cloudy dark amber, rugged head.  Hops in aroma, not overpowering tho.  Flavor quite nice, hops are delicious, not too grapefruity.   Creamy malt feel supports flavor well.  Long lasting head with lacing.  A fine pale ale.","York, SC via NJ, South Carolina, USA","HighlanderOne"

1906,"2007-07-06",2.5,"Pours golden with a nice white creamy head. Looks good! Faint, faint aroma. Mainly yeast, malt and bread. Tastes rich, with some hops and a bit of bitterness. Smooth, but a real skunk aftertaste; reminiscent of Heineken or equal. Makes me think of an upscale macro. Real good on the first sip, then subsequent sips either A) didnt taste good or B) tasted bad or C) all of the above. Other Smuttynose selections were tastier.","Webster, New York, USA","emobassfoo"
1906,"2007-06-28",3.1,"Pours a cloudy light amber color with a thin, small head.  The lacing produced thin ringlets down the pint glass.  The scent wasnt dominating, but did produce some notes of citurs and hops.  The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side as the hops and malt balanced eachother nicely.  An average beer, not bad to have a sixer around in an emergency.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"
1906,"2007-06-27",4.0,"Bottle.  Poured a cloudy orange-brown color with a thick off-white head.  Lots and lots of lacing.  Very pleasant aroma with a nice citrus kick.  Flavor was bitter and hoppy, but not nearly as good as I thought this would be with its nice aroma.  Grapefruit juice aftertaste.  Very bitter, but not as flavorful as I would have hoped.  Still a very above average pale ale.","Overland Park, Kansas, USA","Dansting"

1906,"2007-06-12",2.6,"Bottle.  Pours a darker, sort of cloudy amber with a limited head.  Nose was lightly citrus with some funky/off-smelling notes.  Flavor initially was a continuation of that off smelling nose.  After the beer warmed,  this settled out and dissapated.  However, the beer was never anything special, OK at best.  Thanks to Wild4mild for the bottle.","10aFly, New Jersey, USA","Thaichile"
1906,"2007-06-04",3.3,"Not a bad choice.... Pours deep hazy amber into the glass with a perfect head... pock-marked and stiff, almost like eggwhites.  Citrus, hops and candy fruit rings are on the nose.  Very crisp and biscuity, pale malts quite evident (Crystal, it seems primary) with a high-hop cleanliness to the palate.  Long finish, bready.  Overall, good integration between bitters and biscuit malt.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

1906,"2007-05-15",3.7,"Bottle: This is an underrated English Ale. Pours a nice cloudy bronze/amber color with a substantial tan head. Has a great fruity hop aroma; some golding/fuggle, and blood orange suggestions. Also has an earthy malt component with a hint of oats. Flavor is no disappointment. Upfront it has peppery fruity flavors. Earthy hop characteristics with some dark citrus notes. Has a toasty bready malt background and a hint of caramel sweetness. The finish is rich, bready and bitter. This is a very solid English Pale Ale.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

1906,"2007-04-16",2.6,"12 oz bottle from variety pack.  Copper color, white head that dissipates quickly, average flavor, mouthfeel and palate.  I would agree about the sourness.  A touch of bitter hoppiness, getting it close to IPA territory, but not quite.  Similar to the porter in that there is a bit of over-bitterness, which I wouldnt expect out of a PA.  Not one of the best pale ales Ive had.","Akron, New York, USA","gwpom"

1906,"2006-07-03",3.2,"Ah, not my cup of tea. Cracked this one open thinking it was another decent American Pale Ale. The pour was pretty colored for a pale ale, rich copper, a very nice initial head that had excellent retention. The lacing was also very solid, looked very much like an altbier, a very pretty beer. The aroma was all bitter, not a lot going on. The first two sips were a little pine-like with some citrus rind type flavors. However, the after taste was strong bitter hops without much flavor, sending a zingy-ness across the tongue.  After about three sips, I was convinced this was more English hopped than American and realized it was indeed an English PA. However, unlike the usual English PA, this thing seemed as hopped as much as the usual American PA in terms of hop strength. Malt underneath was hardly detectable, slight caramel and thats about it. Highly imbalanced, not enough hop flavors or other flavor complexity. Mouthfeel was moderate to light-moderate with average carbonation. Somewhat dry finish.","","User37895"
1906,"2006-06-29",3.5,"Appearance: lightly hazed, amber/copper color, creamy, stable head. Lookin good...

Aroma: malty, sharply fruity, sweet, hops get louder over time, but play it cool at the front. Nice enough.

Taste: Full bodied, bold entry on the palate, flush with fruity flavor. Bright, brash taste, quickly drying on the tongue. This feels like a meatier ESB, and doesnt taste like any pale ale, American, British, or otherwise...more of an amber ale, actually, especially with the lopsided malt-to-hop quotient. 

Drinks down smooth, with plenty of flavor all the way through. Another meeting with a Smuttynose ends far from disappointment.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

The nose is mostly just grassy hops with a hint of toast in the background.  Light-medium bodied, trending pretty close to medium, carbonation is good, and the beer is very clean.

The nose: nice blend of hops- no strong single hop character stands out (not screaming citrus or pine or grass) , but a nice balance. Maltiness and a subdued fruitiness from the yeast blend in as well.
The flavor: hoppy and malty up front, bitter with some caramel in the middle and a reasonably dry finish.

Cascade hops initially moderately strong, but evens out quickly and a mild malt flavor, that reminded me of graham crackers rounds out the palate.  This beer was from the bottle and was exceptionally well balanced.  No problem with carbonation.  Hops do not last as long, and the malt flavor is a nice change.  Beer presents a very warm, drinkable texture and though the beer is not strikingly unique in any way, it is simply an impressively made beer.  I did not find the bitterness that was spoken of by several people, though the body was a little less full than I would like in a pale ale.  A great rendition of the EPA, could even handle more malt.  7/3/7/3/142005 draught  Theres a good rustic, minerally and hay-like hops and malt interplay here, grainy, lightly fruity and very crusty-baked bread-like, but I cant say much about the malt sweetness.

1906,"2002-03-26",4.2,"Cloudy colored, hoppy aftertaste, on the whole a very nice beer. (No points for it, but great looking bottle design, and cap reading make mine a smutty was pretty cool) Little head, tastes like a homebrew, but not too foamy, wonderfull on the whole. Slight bitter taste, but great finidh smooth yet complex. Only bought a single but will buy more for next time I get together with beer loving friends. Highly recommended.","Toledo, Ohio, USA","LuckeyHaskins99"
1906,"2002-03-21",4.1,"rich orange color with a medium haze.  generous cushion of lingering suds. the aroma leaps to greet you like a happy golden retriever. orange zest and something that reminds me of gutting a halloween pumpkin, the seeds maybe.  grapefruit tanginess leads the flavor, dry and full bodied, very cleansing, but its the aroma that stays with you, just like that faithful retriever.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
1906,"2002-02-15",2.1,"Aroma is too fruity and is reminiscent of a sour peach.  Nice color but the bitter aftertaste dominates the taste buds abd almost makes one forget about the initial flavor.  On a whole, it just smells and tastes too acidic.","New York, USA","Steak"

1906,"2001-11-14",4.1,"Amber with a clearly Pale Ale nose.  Intense Pale Ale taste.  A very good one, very typical of the kind.  A definite hit from this brewery!","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"
1906,"2001-11-11",3.2,"Fruity, hoppy nose.  Copper color.  Nicely balanced hop bitterness.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
1906,"2001-11-11",3.3,"Americna pale? This is all English, folks.  Orangey dark red hue; earthy malts, what I believe to be fuggles, bitter chocolate, plums and maybe a touch of peat on the nose; medium body; earthy palate, bark-like flavours, herbal bitterness, dark unsweetened chocolate; finishes bittersweet.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1906,"2001-11-05",3.9,"Golden orange, with a thick creamy head, grapefruit hop aroma, grapefruit flavour with some caramel malt underneath, which lingers on the finish.  Night as dry as a typical APA, nor as bitter, but quite good.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
1906,"2001-10-10",3.6,"Nice malty backbone with a Cascade juicy bite on top. I noticed this on tap and now in the bottle but theres a weird herby flavor (sage, savory) underneath. Its interesting, not as disturbing as I once thought. Some nice malt notes and a very well  balanced pale.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
1906,"2001-09-03",4.3,"One of the better ales from my home state. Clerly a favorite of many.","CANADA","John Wentworth99"
1906,"2001-07-29",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2006 12oz. bottle:  This one pours a clear amber color.  There was very little off-white head to it.  Somewhat weaker aroma, yet still pleasant.  Some floral notes, as well as a hint of caramel malts.  The taste has a bit of a grapefruit hoppiness to it, without being overly bitter.  Decent malt body.  A good beer.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
1906,"2001-04-19",3.9,"Nice copper color.  Thin head.  Excellent citrusy spicy aroma.  Crisp flavor - plenty of nice hop flavor and big round malty mouthfeel.  Excellent balance.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
1906,"2001-01-15",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2010 courtesy of fiulijn - hazy dark amber colour with a hugely foamy beige head; nice lacework; a fair resiney hoppy nose with notes of hazelnut, a bit buttery; low carbonation and very smooth, a gentle bitterness, hoppy aftertaste with a touch of herbs, mint and hazelnut","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"

crisp. A superior example of
an American pale.","Leonia, New Jersey, USA","kenk99"
1906,"2000-09-21",3.9,"Good as pale as go, Im not overly impressed. Decent malt nose and a fair hop crispness. Clean, fresh, but a little on the light side for me. A good session beer non the less.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1906,"2000-08-07",4.1,"Unfiltered Pale Ale.  Very hoppy, and the yeast gives it an extra bite that I cant put my finger on.  Ive never tasted anything like this before.  If you like hazy beers (as in, Hefe hazy), and Pale Ale, this is a must try.  Very interesting, and very good.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"
