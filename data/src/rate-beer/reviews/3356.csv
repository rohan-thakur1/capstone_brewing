3356,"2016-11-07",3.9,"Bomber purchased at Bine and Vine ($5.49). Bottle says 5% ABV, though it states 4% here. POURS a hazy yellow-peach hue with a half finger of white foam. AROMA is very fruity -- peach, melon, mild grapefruit, tropical fruit, with some danks notes (more like overripe fruit). FLAVOR of earthy hops, stone fruit (peach, apricot), melon (cantaloupe, some watermelon), mellow citrus, with a somewhat weak but still evident bit of balancing malt. Ligher palate with low to moderate bitterness. Certainly one of the better and more flavorful low-ABV IPAs that I have had. Need to make it up to the brewery some time because I have really liked their stuff that trickles down here to San Diego. (25, 1046)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

3356,"2015-12-23",4.4,"Holy danky amazing nose. Such herbal earthy dank. Fairly clear pale yellow with a medium sized white head. Taste is just as danky, yet not overly bitter, just a great balance of hop flavor and light malt backbone. Shit this is good! Just as good as the best IPAs and DIPAs.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3356,"2015-11-11",3.8,"Tap @ Toronado. Pours light Amber with a small head, short retention with no lacing. Aroma is an amazing hoppy, citrus, and mango combo. Flavor falls apart from the great aroma with a wheaty, pastey taste that ends with disappointment in what could've been with a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.

The funk character is much more mellow and rounded out than Nelson sometimes is, which I guess is attributed to the Mosaic. Super smooth and sessionable.
