How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed when probably close to one year of age.  Bottle sent to me by after4ever, thanks a lot Tom
The look: Burgundy body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose is vinous and woody, a whole lot of wine barrels, dark cherries with some funk (leather & barnyard).  Taste is an opposition between roundness and sharpness.  There is a strong underlying sweetness with a thick fruit juice concentrate, dark berries, sweet cherry juice.  But there is also a whole lot of mouth puckering tannins, oak dryness, cherry skin and plenty of lactic acid.  Sourness level is very high.  Carbonation is relatively smooth, mouthfeel is thick and juicy.  This is definitely a sipper.  Overall I thought the beer was a bit too much for its own good, this one looses some points for low drinkability.  It is a good beer but I must admit I struggled to finish the bottle and there were a few things I didnt enjoy here.

My pour has a dark burgundy color with a dark brown middle. The edges are noticeably transparent, and there is a frothy off-white collar.

There is a lot of balsamic vinegar in the nose. Sweet and sour cherries, some raisins, and some other general dark fruits.

The flavor is a lot more balanced. Nice sweet cherries start out. Some light malt hides in the back as the flavor turns tart. Sour cherries, red grapes, and some raisins all provide some nice fruit flavor. There is some balsamic tartness and a light funkiness toward the end.

The body has a sweet, full start and more of a tart and dry finish. Medium bodied with light carbonation and a softness that I dont see in too many wilds.

The flavor killed it with strong cherry and dark fruits plus oak and a brisk acidity. Nice leather presence there as it warmed.

3417,"2011-01-30",3.6,"750ml bottle, 2010 vintage aged a few months.  Pours an extremely dark, clear burgundy-crimson colored body.  A small, smooth head of beige foam pushes out towards the edge quite quickly, leaving just a thin ring with a wispy film at the center.  Aromas of cocoa dusted black cherries lend a sweet and savory sourness, as loads of lactic yeast and tart, buggy oak lend acidity and funk.  Various other fermented dark fruits linger in the background, perhaps some fig and some plum.  The barrel character is quite vinous, offering grape skin tannins and some peppery, earthen character.  The first sip induces a puckering reaction, intensifying the sharp tannins and downright sour cherry notes.  Still, there is ample sugar remaining, even after the lactic acidity has undoubtedly munched a ton of it up.  It almost comes across as a sour black cherry compote, showing both juiciness and sharp, dry acid.  The palate is fairly hefty in stature, most of its body coming from residual sugars.  Carbonation is on the light side, which only serves to exaggerate the leftover sugars.  Despite these flaws, it remains largely  sharp and dry for an 8% beer.  Overall, I found this to be quite enjoyable.  By no means does it approach perfection, but a nice hearty pour isnt out of the question for a variety of moods or climates.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

4.0 T: Cherry is strongest flavor. Next is acetic acid, oak, tannins, plum and fig, dark grapes. Reasonably tart but only slightly sour if that makes sense.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Tart at start and finish. The problem is that this could be a lot more creamier.

4.0 D: Tasty brew. Definitely got the sour fix I was looking for. Mouthfeel could be a bit better, but the taste is pretty good and the nose is great.

Sharp in its acidity, perhaps more so than any other ales of Ron that Ive had as the man generally keeps his sour ales to drinkability heights. Strong oak character provides whispers of vanilla and dark fruits that remind of black cherries more than anything, but blackberries would not be far either. Not juicy though, this is straight up dry and tart, its residual sugars having been eaten up.

3417,"2009-07-26",3.7,"Tap at PIB. Deep red pour with a small and thin tan head. Aroma is hefty on the cherries, with some vinous notes and a light oak. Flavor puckers you up immediately with cherry and vinous notes, and finishes with a bit of oak bite. Solid beer, though perhaps not quite worthy of the hype.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","Beardface"
3417,"2009-07-20",1.3,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2009 Draught.  Poured read with thick white head.  Oakey and malty aroma.  Tasted like cough syrup, with tinges of vomit.  Oak finish.  Disgusting.","Munchen an der Willamette, Oregon, USA","troopie"
3417,"2009-07-16",3.9,"On-Tap @ Concordia Ale House poured into Snifter glass.

Pours a clear, deep ruby complextion with a thin and fizzy tan head that quickly dissolves and creates a swirling thin layer atop the glass. The aroma is tart cherries, general sourness and some touches of oak. The flavor is very tart upfront with cherries and rounds out with some hints of the oak. Its medium bodied and is very effervescent. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer sitting outside in the sweltering sun. Thirst-quenching and refreshing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DiabolikDUB"
3417,"2009-07-07",3.7,"100? Its been a whirlwind. Anyway draft at Concordia Ale House. Dark red/brown with a thin tan head, no lacing. Musty, sweet, theres the sour, then fig? Sip, WHAM sour smacks you in the face. Then my tongue goes numb and soon after my lips get tingly. Flavor is mostly musty sourness, cherry, fig, raisin, a little sweet, tart lemon, some oak maybe oh and green apple finish. Over all complex and if you can deal with so much sour good but Id prefer a little less sour and more balance.","Portland, Oregon, USA","leems"
3417,"2009-05-08",4.0,"And here we are...#500.  Cool.  Nice dark ruby red with brown tones pour and a light tanned rim sticking head with this.  You can see right through it with a candle behind it, a bit odd.  Even right off the cold pour the sour musty funk hits your nostrils like a blast of fresh air.  Loads of sour funky fermentation, light hints at oak, faint tones of sour cherries, and straight up bitter sweet and sour funk coat the palate thickly, but not overly done.  Medium body.  Nice lingering funky finish.  MMMMMmmmmmm good.  Great beer for #500!!","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
3417,"2009-05-07",3.9,"Mason jar from Uber, thanks to WeeHeavySD for sharing! Pours a clear amber-brown. Rich aroma, of grapes, raisins, wine, malt, wood, sugar. Sour taste, of currants, wine, lemon, oak, malt, and sugar. Lingering wine-oak flavors. Odd, but it works well.","San Diego, California, USA","dalekliz"
3417,"2009-04-25",3.8,"Deep rich purple.  Prickly hugely oak heavy nose, instantly says Flemish red.  Tart black cherries, currants, brown sugar, light char oak. Heavenly. Creamed wheat and brown sugar develop in the nose with time.  Turns towards some intoxicating womens perfume at some point :) Creamy rich and smooth up front, develops some prickliness and pepperiness and noticeable acidity across the middle. Tangy, tart, intense, well rounded, absolute delicious. A touch of sweet plum and cherry in a long lasting finish.  Awesomely drinkable, I could drinks gallon like it was nothing.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3417,"2009-04-19",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2011 On tap at the brewpub. Nice warm red cherry and light sweet bourbon and oakish, mingled with fruit. Pours a dark, darker red brown, with a thin off-white head. Flavor is rich and vibrant. Nice, nice ruby red flavor, thats a bit generic but bright and crisp. Foaming in the mouth, it throws a really bright citric acid with a touch of cheesy funk. A nice balance of acid, sweetness and alcoholic, without any sense of getting acetic. A really solid version that ends with the faintest smoked-salmon and hop juice, in a fresh Iris-kind of way. Nice.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3417,"2009-04-09",4.2,"Tap at uber.

Nice red with a rich head. Tart Flanders-red aroma, some cherry, some wood. Tons of cherry in the flavor, though not overly sweet. Terrifically approachable, very drinkable, some earthiness mixing into the cherry juice and oak to give it just that extra something, a hint of leather, wow. Just so drinkable. I could through a ridiculous amount of this on a warm summer evening. Right on!","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
3417,"2009-04-07",4.1,"Special thanks to Art Larance for this one.  Poured from a growler, still with great carbonation.  Aromas of raspberries, oak, vanilla.  Actually a little reminiscent of a Fruit Roll Up in the nose.  Flavors follow with very sour berries and a good sweetness.  Like the other Cascade sours Ive had, this is extremely drinkable.  Another good one.  I wish these guys were local.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
3417,"2009-04-06",3.7,"On tap at Baileys in Portland, which is a pretty cool place.  Color was a dark auburn with an off white/tan head.  Aroma of sour fruit and yeast; some oak and wood.  Quite good.  Flavor was not hugely sour.  Fruit and apples, with some wood and cherry.  Tasty beer.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
3417,"2009-03-27",3.9,"Hand bottle (Thanks riversideAK!) Pours a ruby/burnt auburn with a wispy tan head. Nice aroma with tart fruity notes and solid oak presence. Some cranberry, underlying toffeeish notes, buttery oak, and a mild lactic tartness. Slick on the palate- with a flavor that meshes a lightly sweet buttery oak note and a tart fruitiness. Some passion fruit, cranberry, and mild toffee. Lightly lactic giving it a tartness- but the earthy funk/leather comes through toward the back only with warmth. Vinous, with a clean finish- offering a note of residual toasted malts. A very easy going sour, well done.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
3417,"2009-03-09",3.8,"Draft @ Powerhouse; nice deep ruby color and very cherry syrupy aroma; very complex flavor that kept me second guessing on what I was tasting; very unique. (#18)","Mill Creek, Washington, USA","eyesolus"
3417,"2009-03-07",4.1,"Mason Jar from Uber via trade with Suzygreenburg, aka Ben, Ben you rock!!!  Pours deep burgundy with a tan head.  Nose is sweet and funky and somewhat muted.  Taste is wonderfully complex with tons of dark fruit, rich funk, man this is totally delicous.  Ron and Cascade hit another home run, hell this might even be a grand slam.  Damn this beer is awesome!","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

3417,"2009-02-13",3.9,"Growler, courtesy GodofThunder. Pours a nice looking reddish brown color with a small white head that quickly dissipates to bubbles at the edge. The aroma shows notes of sour cherries, funky oak, blackberries, and some mild vanilla. The flavors are sour up front with cherries, blackberries, and other sweet-tart fruits. The oak starts to show itself with some tannins, and some oaky vanilla to balance things out and add sweetness. Everything is balanced so well. Medium bodied with good carbonation and sour cherries on the finish. This is a really easy drinking sour with great flavor and use of the oak. Solid beer.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3417,"2009-02-12",4.0,"Tap @ Baileys Taproom...  Poured deep ruby with a beige head.  Sour -- wine-like aroma -- and very tart fruit.  Dry palate with lots of carbonation.

3417,"2009-02-10",4.0,"Tap @ Raccoon Lodge:  Amber/copper pour with a small white head.  Aroma is well-balanced of sweet and tart with subtle ba notes.  Some fruity tones make their way through with a mild acidity.  Flavor is where its at with this brew:  Dark fruits, sweet, tart, sour, oaky notes, vanilla; theyre all here.  Just blended so well.  The most impressive from the sample tray.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
3417,"2009-02-09",3.9,"Sampled from growler courtesy GodofThunder.  Clear ruby-brown color with a little ring of white head.  Mild acetic aroma with sweetness below, mild tannins, plums, apples.  Taste has an almost malic sourness, slight vinegar taste.  Slight cherry notes come out on the finish.  Very nice flemish.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
3417,"2009-02-09",4.0,"Growler... This beer rocks!... Clear ruby-colored ale with a small, creamy, white head. Fruity, lactic, acetic aroma that hints at cherries. Medium-bodied with a caustic mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Super sour, fruity and fun. A blend of cherries, raspberries and blackberries. Tart, abrasive, dry finish. Many thanks to GodOfThunder for reeling in and sharing yet another fantastic growler of beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3417,"2009-02-07",3.7,"Growler courtesy GodofThunder. Pours a brownish red with a thin white head. Aroma is nice perfumy cherry and some sour vinegar, but nicely blended. Taste is slightly sour cherry, tart with a nice touch of malt to balance things out. Dare I say, this is a very sessionable sour and damn tasty, thanks Jay!!","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
3417,"2009-02-03",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2009 On tap at Naked City.  Pours dark brownish-red with a small off-white head.  Sour nose with a little bit of honey.  Lots of apple and honey in the taste and finish.  Very tasty.","Seattle, Washington, USA","snakeoilpete"
3417,"2009-01-14",4.0,"Draft at Uber. Pours a very dark but still transparent rubied garnet, closer to mahogany in the middle. Dense creamy tan head. Nice lacto nose, sharp biting tartness gets you as soon as you lift the glass. Creamy medium body, plenty of pleasantly assertive carb. Crisply tart, some tree fruit, tangy, never goes minerally, along with some black bread and caramelly notes underneath. Far underneath. I really cant get enough of Cascades beers, and cant say enough about them when I do get them. This ones no exception. Wonderful stuff.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3417,"2009-01-05",4.0,"On tap at the PDX Green Dragon. Pours dark brown, soft red hues around the edges, faint off-white head. Tart cherry nose, medium acidity. I really dig the flavor of this brew, the acidity wasn’t over the top, but complimented the cherry and chocolate flavors, making them refreshing and dried out the palate leaving you wanting another sip. Good sour brown.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3417,"2008-12-27",3.1,"Wonderful scotch-color with perfect frothy, foamy, creamy topping. Mildly woody notes with some sourness in aroma but well rounded with some cherry and general fruitiness. Flavor is less impressive. Certainly drinkable, but awash with a mishmash blend of sourness, balsalmic vinegar, and light fruitiness. Ok for a sour ale, but not my thing.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
3417,"2008-12-12",4.1,"Deep dark pour that has touches of brownness, unusually ale-like for sour. Roasty deep wood notes with a great robust tartness. My first notes had it as a stronger Duchesse but on second try I think it is much more along the lines of a brown-sour. Dark fruits, light molasses and a touch of jerky. Wish it would go a bit more sour but very good, another favorite from Cascade","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
3417,"2008-12-12",3.8,"Pours a dark ruby brown with a good head  decent lacing. Darker than I expected  the aroma is a good cross between a Belgian quad and a Flanders red, but its a bit more astringent. Tart cherries and raspberries meet darker fruits and some brown sugar. Its a great concept, and a very good brew, but I feel like the flavor is a bit on the mild side, and its lacking a bit of depth for this dark of an ale.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
3417,"2008-12-08",3.9,"Bigwoodfest. Clear garnet with a tan head. Nice tart cherry lemon aroma with toasted caramel. Medium body with a prickly mouthfeel.
