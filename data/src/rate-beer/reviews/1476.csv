Arômes étonnamment sèches où le cacao, le bourbon, la torréfaction forment un ensemble intense et chaud. Ça fesse comme on dit! Beaucoup de grains de café torréfiés ainsi que de lextrait de vanille à profusion. Quelques notes fumées qui me rappellent lEurope du Nord et un bourbon caramélisé bien agressif. Un certain manque déquilibre à mon avis, bien que plaisante à boire. Un petit verre me suffit.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

The sip reveals a very sweet bourbon flavor with mild cocoa and vanilla underneath. Faint roasty malt and coffee struggles to be heard. Slightly watery body. Solid, but the Elijah Craig barrel-aged version is MUCH more complex and delicious.

Theres also some weird dirty green bean character. Flavor is great if you really like bourbon, but Im feeling like the beers overwhelmed by the barrel in this case.

1476,"2011-06-17",3.9,"On nitro-tap at Capones. Served in a mini snifter.

Pours near black with a really nice head that goes from light tan to nearly white at the top. Beautiful nitro head. Some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose immediately carries a ton of vanilla with some nice chocolate notes in the background. As it warms, a nice bourbon character and mild oak presence take hold.

The flavor isnt quite as complex or integrated as the nose -- and doesnt contain nearly as much vanilla -- but its still quite nice. The bourbon takes on the dominant role with some chocolate and light vanilla backing. Mouthfeel is uber-creamy and nicely carbonated. Really solid effort, and Im glad I finally got to try this one, which has been on my radar for quite some time.

This creamy cake of a Barrel-Aged Imperial Porter offers generous portions of coffee, vanilla, bourbon and chocolate in a fluffy mouthfeel redolent of airy icing.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thick cappuccino-like foam bobs atop the utter darkness. 
-Although perhaps not as complex, this is as decadent a dessert as Bourbon Barrel-Aged Péché Mortel.
-The finish is tad too boozy for my liking, but at the same time the alcohol helps to cut through the sweetness. 
-The nose screams dessert and the tastebuds thus immediately demand a diabetic orgasm. 
-This is one of those rare beers which works wonderfully when served on nitro.
