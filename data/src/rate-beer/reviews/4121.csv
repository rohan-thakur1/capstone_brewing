4121,"2016-12-27",4.3,"25 cl bottle, on Dec 27, 2017.Clear dark reddish brown color, some really nice thick legs. Vanilla, sweet, alcohol, tart fruit skin, Romerska Bågar/chocolate orange, slight raisin a bit wood scent. Also some almonds and ripe plums. Sweet, tart, wood, alohol, raisins, berries, vanilla taste. Sweet, raisin, berries, slight vanilla aftertaste. Warming alcohol. Full, smooth mouthfeel, slight tart finish. The vanilla is evident, a bit too much for me in the nose, and a not quite enough in taste and aftertaste where is is overshadowed by raisins. I liked the original batch 2 with no vanilla a tad more, this feels like the alcohol and the tartness comes through more, making it a tad less drinkable and not as smooth. Still a very nice mead!","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
