2929,"2017-06-05",1.1,"This is for a 2015 bottle I just purchased. Poured and looked like a cider. Almost smelled like a cider, a funky cider. Taste though..............tasted sweet with a not-so-subtle aftertaste of urine. I imagine this is what diabetic urine tasted like before the invention of insulin. Thats right, this cider tastes like sweetened piss. Do yourself a favor and, instead of buying this saccharine pee, read this article about all the things doctors in the 1800s learned about tasting their patients urine. Its a much less terrible way to spend your free time.

2929,"2015-12-31",4.1,"Pictured bottle, 2014 vintage from Louisville Beer Store; shared with my Boo.

Light metallic, and some stale urine is also present. Transparent yellow body with a fizzy, white, bubbly, quickly dissipating head. Starts with a pleasant apple sweetness, but not too sweet. Becomes a little more tart in the middle with some drying and dusty yeast character. Bright and bubbly with some cereal like sweetness to finish. This is pretty damn tasty.

2929,"2015-09-12",4.2,"750 ml. bottle. It pours very clear yellow with a fizzy, disappearing white head. The aroma jumps out as rather funky, with a touch of sulfur, yeast, white grape, hay and apples. It kind of reminds me of a brett beer by the smell of it due to my relative ignorance of ciders. The flavor is more apple forward, but still has some toasty hay-like funk and bready yeast. Theres definitely a distinct ""farmhouse"" character here that balances the sweetness from the apples perfectly. The mouthfeel is light, but the sweet apples make it feel bigger. Ok, now I think Ill be getting into ciders a bit more. Delicious.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

2929,"2013-01-20",3.3,"Pours a very fizzy light golden body with a huge fizzy head thats unusually long-lived for a cider. Due to the extraordinary high carbonation the it takes quite some time before the white head disappears. The aroma is strong, complex and, to a cider novice like myself, quite demanding. Sure, there are notes of fermented apples, but even stronger are pungent notes of barnyard, leather and horse. I sort of like horses, but this is almost too much. Also some very vague sulphuric notes in the back. The taste is light sweet with a moderate dry finish. The flavours follow the aroma: a sweaty horse in front, followed by a barnyard with fermented apples and leather. A bit fuller body than most ciders Ive had. A nice one, but I get this ""Im not worthy"" feeling while drinking it, Im sure this one is better than my simple palate manages to appreciate.

The aroma is particularly appealing seems pretty funky in a sort of hay and farm-animal kind of way at first, but that doesnt dominate the bouquet. The apple rind is more prevalent here than the fleshy part of the apple but there is plenty of that character in there as well. The Cider has fruity and mineral-y characteristics akin to a nice dry white Italian wine and is not particularly sweet smelling but perfectly balanced in every way. 

The flavor is semi-sweet and very red apple-forward right up front but this soon changes to nice light mineral and apple rind notes. The cider is nicely tart but not particularly sour, becomes very dry mid palate, and stays that way for the finish. Some light floral notes balance this out just right.

2012 bottle from Total Wine, sampled November 2014
Visual description as above. This time apple and musty basement, also a strong sulfuric musk that is just too much. Flavor has some sweetness, but not that much, drying out late. 
I dont know whether it was there the first time and I was too intimidated by the style to complain, or whether this bottle is somehow different, but after drinking a reasonable number of additional ciders (albeit few from Normandy) Im able to say with some confidence that this isnt a characteristic that appeals to me. Mouthfeel is abundantly carbonated but soft rather than prickly. Nice. Its certainly interesting and rustic and distinct from the Washington ciders Ive had (Finnriver goes the furtherest in the complexity direction, but without the sulfur). But the almost putrid aspect detracts from my enjoyment of what otherwise would be a really nice cider. Id go about 5/4/7/4/14=3.4. Ill split the difference. 

Addendum: Holly knocks it out of the park with an aroma descriptor: ""It smells like a cross between a pickle and a perm."" I dunno about the pickle, but shes got it spot on with the perm. This smells like a nasty-ass hair salon.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Strong notes of leather and funky barnyard notes come through in the aroma, illustrating the array of brettanomyces-based compounds.  The palate shows a strong farmhouse/barnyard character up front and through the middle, before transitioning to a more traditional apple/cider character.  The finish is an interesting combination of the two, with the final note tending more toward leather than malic character.  Carbonation is assertive without being over-the-top.  Overall, the brett character adds tremendous complexity, but borders on being almost unpleasant at times.  True to the assertion of being a farmhouse cider.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Pours a clouded straw golden with minimal head, but plenty of prickly carbonation. Interestingly, the lambic yeastiness fades completely from the favor profile, leaving a dry chalky fruit flesh behind thats delicate, mineral-laden, and expressive. Carbonic acids bring sweeping MacIntosh-like apple flavors, cooked apple bread, and sweet estery alcohols. The palate on this is just amazing. Dry, crisp, but full and balanced.

2929,"2010-04-29",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2010 At first impression is almost disappointingly ragged-tasting. Simple and sweet lacking acidity. A bit dilute, and musty taste of rotting underbrush. But wait!! The musty rot is taking on a stone cellar character and the tanginess of apple flesh and apple peel now comes through a bit. Actually the acidity becomes longer and more serious in gradual increments, it is actually a touch acetic. What a wild tasting cider! It is a real sipper and captures the French fascination with nobly rotting apples as an art form. In the end very good and demanding a cider.  ** LATER ADDITIONAL NOTE **  I had actually sampled this a year earlier, at Ginger Man.- described it as having a Duchesse-like Lambic quality, less sweet, nice oldness (I love that!) and beautiful lacing (?) It was less challenging that time, was the Cidre a little different in May 2009 or was it me? Obviously a beer to adventure with every time you see it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

2929,"2009-01-21",3.1,"2007 corked 375 into snifter, served at cellar temp %0F.  My first REAL cider... here we go.  I have feared this for a long time and never seen it happen -- upon opening the cage slowly, the bottles pressure forced the cork out once the cages counter pressure was released upon me untwisting it!  Thankfully, I untwisted the cage slowly due to my fear of this reaction!  Thankfully, again, I didnt loose any liquid.  Once the cork popped, tons of bubbles started racing from the bottom of the bottle to the top -- big fat bubbles.  Big fizzy very rapidly fading head exactly like that resulting from a hard pour of a sprite.  Pale gold body with more raising carbonation than a Macro pale lager!!  So much so that it is actually building the head back up. Very earthy aroma with hints of sour apple, a gueuze-is tartness/crispness, oak, and a humid mustyness  -- all very subtle on the whole.  The flavor is pretty unique and also very subtle in character.  Sweet apples upfront that fades into a crist slightly tart dryness that finishes juicy with a flavor that I can only liken the the aroma of Band-Aids, if that makes any sense.  Very light body with more carbonation than I have ever encountered (again, like in a sprite).  Overall: not quite my thing, but interesting at the very least.  Not worth the price IMO, but worth a try at least once.  Inoffensive.  The Band-Aid flavor has vanished after the first few sips.  It just seems like a very subdued beverage.

With that being said, this is the best cider I have yet to come across. Pours out visibly effervescent clear gold with a fizzy head, reducing to nothing within seconds. The nose is musty, cheesy, and tart green apples with some light acetic acid (vinegar). The flavour is not as tart as the aroma suggests and the finish is all green apples, though the finish is very short. The finish is also characterized by its dryness and a breif sweet lingering. Suggestions of cinnimon are striking me in the mid-palate profile, as well as sweet vanilla custard? I expected more barnyard funk and leather judging by the aroma, but such flavours were absent.

The extremely strong carbonation is represented by a crazy amounts of bubbles flying throughout the glass. The cider is a dark yellow color and its actually difficult to see through it because of the vigorous carbonation. Aroma is strong with a lightly wild, faintly tart, sweet musky apple. A hefty musk followed by a sharp, short sweetness. Taste is just a nice light apple sweetness. Leaves a faintly wild and tart, lightly sweet aftertaste. The carbonation is really not as felt as one would think looking at the cider.  But it is enough not to make the cider seem too-light.  Extremely quaffable, feel like it can be drank all day.

Medium-strong vanilla with a touch of sugar, but not acidic or tart.  Not really super dry, but nowhere near cloying.  Aftertaste sees the apples return.  Tasting is so dominated by and hidden behind the soft fizziness; its not harsh, like many Champagnes, but still has to be reckoned with.

One of my first ciders from an actual cidery. Pours a slightly hazed apple juice golden. A quick rising white head that fell just as fast. Looks good.

Smells musty upfront. As the cider warms the mustiness falls to the background and green apple comes to the front. Very good. Green apple really becomes present as the cider breathes.

Starts off with that barnyard mustiness thats found in saisons and is quickly overtaken by green apple skin. A good thirst quenching wateriness on the finish. Not as dry as I thought it was going to be. A nice surprise.

Light body with a refreshing crispness. Eventually dries out.

Easy drinker. I could sit and enjoy this all day.

A wonderful cider that would pair well with earthy cheeses. An excellent cider that Im looking forward to trying other samples from this cidery if I can find them.

Light wild yeastiness, some leather and funk.  Flavour is very fruity, lightly bready, sweet baked apples up front with some leathery wet hay funkiness.

2929,"2005-10-11",4.4,"2003 750mL bottle shared with Walt and Eyedrinkale on 9/30/2005.  Actually I ended up drinking most of the bottle because no one else liked it enough to finish it at 4 in the morning.  Pours a glassy, white peach and chardonnay colored golden-yellow, light bubbles forming a pinch of white head that vanishes immediately.  Does not leave thick legs on the glass.  Aroma of sweet, almost nutty, or barny-like notes, a moderate amount of acidity is foretold from the aroma.  Lightly tannic, oily and dry, with a definite blue cheese-like note.  Hints of dry, funky yeast in there too.  Flavor is initially lightly sweet, moderately acidic/tannic and full of strong yeast.  Tastes similar to chardonnay in that the oak character mixed with the yeast imparts a woody-peachy character.  Finish dries out significantly, completely leaving any of this meaty/peachy yeast and wood character.  Instead there is a prominent lacto flavor, a lovely tartness and a lingering apple-champagne-like quality, very rustic and wonderfully flavorful as it lingers on the palate.  Couldnt stop drinking this stuff, even the next morning, after sitting out in the glass it was splendid.  Couldnt help but make the connection with lambic.  Its like an apple lambic in some ways, not nearly as dry and tart, but the lactic character and rustic farmhouse nature, with the natural carbonation and tight mouthfeel all provide similarities.  Wonderful stuff and at $10 for a bottle at my local store, I will certainly be picking some up.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2929,"2005-10-03",3.7,"2003 Vintage. I havent tasted quality cider in awhile, and one should expect good things from the makers of Calvados. I was not disappointed. I think the last quality apple product I enjoyed was New Glarus Apple Ale, and this reminded me of its more refined sibling. Some nice tartness and sweetness together. The acidity somewhat takes me aback. I prefered this much more as it warmed to about room temperature, Im not sure why RB would recommend serving this one at 46.5, which was far too cold to enjoy the nuances of the flavors. Although not a huge cider drinker, this one was one of the better ones Ive tasted. If I were rating according to style, this would be close to a 5.0","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Served in a flute, per ratebeer reccomendation @ 46.5°. It warmed up to 59° on the third, and last, glass. No ""pop"" like I expected after pulling the cork. Really hazy gold color with a light fizzy, quick lasting ""head"" that dies down to a  ring of off-white bubbles.  There is visible particulate matter in the bottom of the glass, it is finely groud pepper sized. The aroma is sour with a brett-like wool blanket funkiness. The taste is tart, acidic, wool horseblanket, orange peel, with some mild apple flavor. A bit of sugary sweetness evens out the tart midtatste and prepares you for a bracing, tart finish of sour apples, and lemon. The mouthfeel is moderate at times with some chewiness to it, but finishes very refreshing. This is certainly different than the hombrew ciders I have had. The last pour is filled with bigger sediment. I also get a distinct aroma of Stilton or Gogonzola and a taste that follows that aroma pretty closely, must be the sediment.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

The aroma actually reminds me of that of a funkier gueuze.  The apple in the aroma seems almost incidental to the overall sourness.  It also carries a barnyard, old hay scent with sweated leather and cobwebs.  The flavor is close to vinegar but definitetly apple.  The lively carbonation also brings with it tastes of lemon, bleu cheese, raw grain, and apple skins & stems.

Appealing farmyard aroma, highly hay reminiscent, oldish and musty, yet bright and fresh apple undertones. Is this yeasty or what? Cheesy, earthy suggestions add a bit of complexity. Gentle yet active carbonation renders a palate cleansing mouthfeel. The apples come out more than in the nose, sweeter than I expected, citrusy almost and unfortunately hinting at 7-up a bit more than Id hope.

2929,"2005-06-11",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2013 Bottle - corked and caged. Vintage 2003. Clouded gold with a effervescent white head. As soon as it erupts, it fizzles out. Nose could easily be mistaken for a gueuze, at least by me. Sour apple, tart fruits, barnyard, horse blanket, and damp basement. Lovely! Im not sure its supposed to be this way, but it evokes relaxing in the French countryside at a farmhouse after a long day of work and enjoying some quality cider. Not sure if that makes sense or if it is just rambling... At any rate, the flavors bring forth a more pronounced apple, less barnyard and horseblanket while bringing some apple jam, straw, light grains and light leather to the table. Body is very bubbly and effervescent. Lots of carbonation to this. Youll be belching for hours. Finish brings it back around to the start with more gueueze-like characteristics coming back out. Light apple, some sugary notes, barnyard, tart fruits, horseblanket, wet wood, and light leather. NICE!!! If all French cidres are like this, I cant wait to try another.

Bottle - 375mL corked and caged. 2002 Vintage. Soft pop when the corked is removed. Golden pour with a short, bubbly and fizzy white head. Small tan particles dance in the center of the pour. Strong funky aroma of tart green apples, sour fruit, damp earth, wet wood and barnyard. Only the green apples clue you into this being a cider. Taste is a bit sweeter than the aroma would let on. Green apples, ripe red apples, funky yeast notes, soft earthiness, wet leather, damp wood and barnyard notes. Body is light-medium with a sparse, bubbly carbonation. Dry during the finish and missing any sugary stickiness. Finishes with more tart fruits, green apples, ripe red apples, touch of spice, earthy notes and funky yeast.

2929,"2004-12-14",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2007 2004 Vintage Sampled February 2007: Opens w/ a bang. Pours crystal clear orange yellow w/ a short lasting foam of a head. Nose is funky, sweaty, musty and cheesy w/ a very definite apple character. The apples become more apparent once tasted due to a moderate sweetness--which is thankfully balanced by brisk and effervescent carbonation. Head and shoulders above the last bottle I tried and a very fine pour indeed. Could easily substitute for champagne at any dinner w/ open minded people.

Original rating: The opening of this bottle was quite eventful. No. It didnt gush. Upon opening an odd cluster of sediment rose to the top of the bottle in a large semi-gelatinous mass. I dont know if thats supposed to happen but thats what happened. The cider was very hazy. In fact, very close to the appearance of sweet, non-alcoholic cider. Upon closer examination, I found a rather unappealing lump of black sediment at the bottom of the glass (this is the first pour, mind you).   The nose is pungent and bretty with a bit of tart apple. Bone dry with an appealing strong apple flavor. So far, so good, right? But heres where things go horribly wrong. The finish tastes like bandaids and antibacterial soap. Gross. I really, really wanted to enjoy this cider--I gave it every chance in the world as I like bretty beers like lambic--but, honestly, this stuff kinda sucks. (2.0)","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2929,"2004-11-11",3.5,"Pours an orange tan with a huge head that fades quickly. Aroma of tart and sweet apples, and a hint of vinegar. Flavor is initially a nice tart apple.

Midway through the experience a real funk sets in and the cider gets nice and barny with dusty notes, brett.  Huh.  Sharp and bitter grapeskin finish is very refreshing.

2929,"2004-11-05",3.6,"RBMNG 10/30/04. Bottled 2002 Vintage. Heres another style, like lambics and gueuzes and sakes, that probably shouldnt be on Ratebeer. But, nevertheless, I dont mind trying these styles and I guess I dont mind telling you how I feel about them. Apple aroma (shocker!), somewhat like  Martinellis (Im sure the Dupont family is crazy mad reading that) with alcohol; more refined, however. Sophistication in the nose. As others in our MN Ratebeer gathering group mentioned, buttered popcorn or caramel apple are other notes identified in the aroma. Hazy light gold in color with lots of sparkles. Nice flavor, although could use a little more sweetness and tartness. A little dull and subdued. Too much of the skin flavor pervardes. Subtle.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"

2929,"2004-10-31",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2004 Bottle of 2002 vintage. Very fizzy and active with carbonation. This spray hit my nose with each whiff. Very light golden color. Aroma is very interesting with notes of sour apples and a little bit of vinegar. The vinegar sourness is like a light lambic. Also has a touch of horseblanket and band-aid notes. Taste is a touch sweet and not sour at all very light with Jonathon apples. Reminds me of white grapes. The taste is just too mild for me, but maybe that is an authentic cider.

Understatedly musty and woody. Surprisingly full in texture and somewhat filmy, with restrained spritz to the carbonation. Snappy and lemony with a medicinal brett bite that is softened by a savory fusion of bandage and extremely ripe apples. Brief, but remarkably quenching  tartness gives way to honey-drizzled white grapes and musty wood flashes with a slight tannic tingle. Just enough spritz to carry the brett spiciness. Mutedly medicinal with rich notes of soft apple must and honeydew. Chewy and leathery, yet continually snappy, with an elegant mixture of pineapples and lemons under a soft phenolic bedding. Richness outweighs the musty dryness in the finish, as it continues with a lasting brett & white grape impression. Beautiful.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Rich aroma, apples of course, a bit of sulfur, pear may be present.  Some notes of horseblanket - on the whole surprisingly lambic-y.  Nicely tart with a smooth well rounded and true apple character.  Finish is soft, sweet.  The brut character is obvious and slightly detracts from drinkability - I prefer a drier finish.

See, this stuff pours like medium amber bubbly, highly fizzy, white soda head quickly disappearing.  Yeasties in my Jever glass.  Smell like the must and oxidation of an empty bushel basket after youve finished collecting the windfalls.  Damp earth like the root cellar when you go in on a rainy October day to get some parsnips for soup that night.  Ever so faintly like gym socks.  Taste flowers, clammy must envelops the daisies and pushes me down towards the depths....effervesence lifts me and lays a blanket of tannic, winey apples beneath me to cushion the descent.

2929,"2004-08-03",4.2,"2002 Label date, Sampled August 2004
Pours with a frothy tan head that quickly disappears after pouring.  It is very well carbonated though, and is a pretty, clear, gold color.  From afar the aroma is of fresh apples, as I go in for a closer sniff though things change dramatically.  I get sharp, funky aromas that remind me of cheese, champagne, and a Lambic-like musty funky barnyard character.  The taste is sweet and apple like, yet not in anyway clean like a commercial cider.  There are definite funky farmhouse cheese notes here, especially in the finish.  There is almost a certain acetone-like finish on this one.  There is a really good apple character here, and I am quite surprised by how much sweetness is left.  The sweetness really helps to accentuate the apple character of this cider, though it probably mutes some of the complexity.  Despite the sweetness, this is still quite light and refreshing.  This is very good, and is certainly the best cider I have had up to this point.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

You can certainly tell the difference in quality.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","crzybob77"
2929,"2004-07-04",3.8,"2001 edition. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange, with furious carbonation and a rapidly dissipating white head. Aroma is mostly apples, with sourness and wood. Taste is not surprisingly mostly apple, relatively little tartness, maybe best compared to a macintosh, has a gueuze-like feel, with some of the barnyard components, mildly acidic, and this baffling salty/ smoked bacon flavor near the finish, then drying. Ive had very little cider tasting experience, so I recognize this as good but cant compare it to others of this caliber. Very good overall.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"
2929,"2004-06-20",3.7,"This sucker brought the funk.  Medium gold, hint of haze, not really any head, just a constant stream of champagne effervescense.  Aroma is faintly barnyard, with some outhouse thrown in for good measure.  There is a hint of apples at the very beginning, but it quickly spirals into a celebration of the workings of the yeast and other beasties that are present.  Cheddar, apple peel, and cottage cheese mingle with each other.  Saison and lambic fans should be happy with this beverage.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Aroma is moderately yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket), with notes of cask wood, toast, apple, grass, caramel, flowers, bandage, etc. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic.

Back in fine form (compared to the 2002), this is not only the highest ABV of the Bruts so far, but also (not surprisingly) made from a particularly sweet crop of apples (50% more sugar than the 2002 had).  It shows.  This is almost caramelized and particularly juicy.  Seems more restrained in the carbonation department too, which is good.  This has plenty of underlying structure beneath the fruit and thus should age particularly well.  Heres the vintage to stock up on, folks!
