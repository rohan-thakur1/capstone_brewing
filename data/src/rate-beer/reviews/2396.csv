Beautiful citrus and slightly piney hop nose, and some tropical pineapple notes from the Galaxy. Very fresh and vibrant. Flavour is bitter grapefruit, slight pine, sweet caramel, and some tropical fruit punch. Very balanced and tasty. 

2014 can:
Pours a rich copper/amber with some off white head. Nose is fragrant and sweet. Pineapple, caramel, orange, passion fruit. Really lovely, the can is doing its job. Flavor is a little lacking. Citrus, caramel, a lovely toasty biscuity note on the finish and a mild bitterness. A bit of a cliff beer, in that the flavor is gone almost as soon as youve swallowed.

Reddish amber color, half finger of off white head, falls quickly to a collar. Not too much visible carbonation. Should be a bit more for the style and ABV level. 

Some tropical fruit notes with passion fruit, lemon , wheat, caramel and malt. Slight bits of pine do show up in this though. 
Toffee, slightly burnt toast ( not in a bad way), tropical notes , then a good dose of pine in the taste. 
Bits of spice in the feel. Does smooth out the sweetness well. Right amounts of carbonation for the style. Get a little more grassy and pine in the feel.  Bitterness picks up nicely while drinking.

2396,"2010-03-12",2.9,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2011 Nose is quite floral and citric. In the mouth it is 50%caramel 50% lingering citirc/floral hops. Well balanced but the malt tends to get more dominant as it warms.","JAPAN","jonno"
2396,"2010-02-26",3.8,"Tap at the brewery. Very tasty. Aromas of roasted malt, caramel, and flowers. Taste is sweet, with a light bitter finish. Velvety palate, medium body. Amber colour, with a frothy white head.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","davidm"
2396,"2010-02-14",3.8,"Draught at The Local Taphouse (Sydney). Another popular one with the GrandMistress. Looks more light brown than amber in the glass. Sour fruit on the nose. A smooth palate with a little creaminess. The malt and hops are quite mellow, but the balance works well. Toffee from the malt and citrus and fruit from the hops. I love the sourness - farmhouse ale like.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"
2396,"2009-04-02",3.1,"Tap at Mountain Goat. Amber (slightly dull) in colour with short head and some lacing. Galaxy hops on the nose and in the taste with some caramel supporting.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
2396,"2009-03-08",3.1,"Tap at Mountain Goat. Served quite cold and really suffers for it. Subtle, integrated, orangey hop aroma in the Goat style, tasting otherwise fairly thin and dominated by angular dark toffee-ish crystal malt flavour, with surprisingly high carbonation and a yeasty note like you get in some bottle-conditioned beers. As it warms, it opens up a lot more. Esters come forward and the malt character rounds out with the crystal malt becoming a lot more bright and glassy, and the yeastiness fades away. Much improved, but still only nice, not great. And how do you score it? Its not like its a pub butchering their beer - it is served as they intend it (presumably).","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"
