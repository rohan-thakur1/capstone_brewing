4276,"2017-01-28",3.3,"Growler daté du 15/01/2017, bue après 2 semaines. Robe dorée assez claire sans col de mousse et à leffervescence plutôt faible. Arômes de malt mielleux, levures basses, épices séchées, agrumes. En bouche, un malt à la fois mielleux et croquant côtoie un houblon noble herbacé et légèrement floral. Petit sucre résiduel, melon-miel, orange. Finale brève. Texture légère et corps mince. Bonne buvabilité.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","Franckg"
4276,"2016-10-21",3.6,"Dégustée en fût à lisle de Garde. Look parfaitement fidèle au style : blond doré, transparent, effervescent à souhait et pourvu dune mousse abondante qui colle parfaitement au verre. Arômes plus granuleux quhoublonnés, de froides levures allemandes, des branches de la grappe de raisin. Un sucre inattendu; un fond de pâtisserie. De la tarte au pain. Texture malheureusement triste qui manque de légèreté pour le style. Le liquide tombe complètement à plat dès son entrée dans ma bouche. Leffervescence comme la fraîcheur sont coupées à mi palais puis me laisse en bouche un grain sucré. Pas mauvais mais les arômes sont plus invitantes que le produit ne lest vraiment.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

4276,"2011-08-10",3.6,"Originally rated October 2006 at the pub. Pours a golden-blonde colour with very good lacing. Same big cereal nose found in their Pitoune brew. Has a grainy mouthfeel. The cereal and grain malt is also present in the taste with a bitter middle, a fruity finish and a grainy aftertaste. Recommended Oktoberfest.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
4276,"2011-01-08",3.7,"Tap at Mondiale 2010.  Pours a clear light golden with a nice white head- sticky lace.  Aroma is doughy clean light pils malt, bread, no sulfur, but slight sweet cider, light acetaldehyde, grass and herbal hops.  Flavor is light green apple skin, flowery herbal hops, fresh green German hops, grassy, toast, bread, cider cuts the middle of the body, light dry finish.  Still pretty good and thirst quenching.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4276,"2010-07-02",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub. Yellow straw with beautiful white lacing. Aroma of vanilla, mint, cloves and cereal. Very good. Taste is very refreshing and simple.

4276,"2010-06-07",3.5,"On tap at Brouhaha anniversary.

Appearance : Crystal clear pale yellow.

Aroma : Yeasty with lots of malts. Some crisp hops, Rather estery. Weird lager...

Taste : Yeasty and crisp. Nice hoppy herbal finish. Some yeast on the finish.

Overall : Weird yeasty and estery lager but highly drinkable and quite crisp and refreshing. A bit watery maybe but it was exactly the easy-drinking beer I needed to quench my thirst and start the session.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
4276,"2009-09-03",3.2,"On tap at the pub. Boring pale gold body with a thin white foamy head. Interesting malty/hoppy aroma with piney and apple hints. Taste is slightly dominated by hoppiness. It ends with a long bitter/herbal finish. Good Dortmunder.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
4276,"2009-04-05",3.3,"Verre de 20 oz, dun fût au Pub Brouhaha. Arômes de miel et de houblon floral. Robe blonde et claire, peu de mousse. Assez maltée pour le style, les céréales légèrement grillées sont bien présentes. Finale moyennement amère de houblon floral, qui demeure assez discret aux niveaux des saveurs. Légère touche poussiéreuse en arrière-goût.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"

4276,"2008-06-06",3.3,"2008-06-01. Crisp yellow body with a small white creamy head. (3) Noble hop aroma, grass, buttercup, light cheesy note, lots of florals. Pleasant moderate hoppy bitterness throughout the flavour. Straw, grass. (6+) Average palate could be just a touch more full bodied. Pretty good example of the style, but the hop profile is not to my taste. On tap, Mondial, Montreal, 2T","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
4276,"2008-06-02",2.9,"Draught at Mondial 2008 
Appearance:  Good medium full gold with medium-large creamy white top. Some lace was noted. 3+Nose  Straight grainy aroma, light drying alcohol on top. Flavor/Palate : Medium bodied , biscuit clean cookie malts. Soft yet with prominent (for style) bitterness. Hops loose its character as you drink, giving space to pale malts.

4276,"2007-07-01",4.0,"Sampled draught at the Mondial, Montreal (May 2007).   Bright, lightly hazy gold with a bit of lasting white cream....hugely malty, creamy aroma, faint noble hops in the background grow a bit more defined with some warmth....wonderfully balanced body, great fresh Munich malts perfectly interacting with grassy, moderately bitter hops, fairly strong sharp finish which just lasts and lasts, offering faint mineralic/chalky notes for interest, but never overpowering.  Another incredibly good helles from Quebec!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4276,"2007-06-09",3.3,"Draught. Bright yellow-gold body with a creamy white head. Smells grassy, hay-like, with crisp biscuit. Again, the flavour is crisp and grassy with sharp lively carbonation. Clean finish. 
Very palatable and refreshing.

4276,"2007-06-04",3.7,"Clear blonde body topped by a small white head.  Pale malts and honeyed cereals abound.  The body is round and feels both soft and crisp.  This one blends the round and pillowy body of a typical Dortmunder/Helles with a crisper almost pilsner-ish body.  The end-result is superb.  The aromatic floral and grassy hops perfectly balance the smooth honey.  Nothing fancy or intense, just a nice everyday beer with a perfect dosage of everything.  A refreshing change from other quebec Germaines who are mostly only good at macramé and gossiping about the neighbours.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4276,"2007-06-01",2.6,"Mondiale 2007.Above average carbonation. medium mouthfeel.  Light cidery a bit of smoke but otherwise plain lager taste.A tad on cream side not much bitterness.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"

4276,"2006-09-10",3.6,"Light golden lager with a thin lacing white head. Light fresh grainy malt in aroma, with some light peppery notes.For a Helles, the hops come out at you, with their herbal quality. Very refreshing. In mouth, an excellent crisp grainy malt with nice classy saaz hops. Bod maintains order between the crisp hops and the biscuitty malt. Very smooth and pleasant. On tap at bar,  Sept. 3 2006.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
4276,"2006-09-04",3.9,"Clear pure blonde colour. The head is white, large and mostly lasting. Excessively clean, pure lager character, spot on as they say. Charming hay field, floral, spicy, soft saaz coming up with pieces of the oily bohemian zing. Light-medium body, impossibly tight and crisp carbonation. Purely extracted, joyous pils malt character, an ever-lasting support for drinkability and the other ingredients showcase. Well well, this is as clean as it gets, Id be curious to roll my tongue along a version conditioned with the yeast. It is almost too clean, a pleasure to drink certainly, but almost too easy to do so. I find myself wanting to drink more without really concentrating on it. A straight road to success, yet I would like to try this and that variant of wildness. An update with come once the next time Im there and drown myself into a whole pint.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4276,"2006-08-30",3.8,"The pour reveals a clear golden color with a thin white head. Superb aroma and flavor of rich malt, bread, hazelnuts and honey with noble hops. The body has a light to medium thickness with a creamy texture and medium to lively carbonation. This is the first beer I had at the brewpub and it is very impressive.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
4276,"2006-08-12",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2006 Any first impressions?
-A sheet of foam protects the clear golden shine.
-An ingenious blend of pils malt and wooden hops seduces physically, and mentally due to its obvious authenticity.
-Pillowy malt serves as the bed for the crunchy, resinous hop flavor and bitterness. 
-The well-fed body is enlivened by active carbonation.

What if you dig deeper?
-I thought Amère à Boire was the only Quebec brewpub to recreate such authentic lager stylings. I closed my eyes and easily saw myself in the Bavarian countryside.
-This was served a little too cold, if I may find something to improve.
-Honeyed, citrusy fruitiness runs through the complex interplay of pils maltiness and spicy, earthy hoppiness.
-This is an extremely well-brewed, flavorful helles, the likes of which I would like to see more often as the house blond in craft brewpubs.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
4276,"2006-04-09",3.6,"Golden blonde with only a few reddish highlights, the head consisted only of ring of clingy lace.
Plenty of noble hop freshness, with a solid, pleasing cereal and honey-like sweetness, and just a touch of smoke.
Decent malt backbone, with plenty of woody, earthy tones and crisp grassy finish.  It was my favorite at the pub during my last visit (07APR2006), and probably the hardest style to nail down well.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
