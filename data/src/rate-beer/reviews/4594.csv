The aroma picked up sweeter, toasted banana and cloves with nice balance between them.. a hint of tanginess from the wheat & spices.. seemed sugary on the back of the nose.  The flavor opened with tart wheat and lemon zest, with wet wheat and a pinch of bready malt behind.. tangy around, but the sugars got in the way a little bit.  Lighter-bodied and dry on the palate.. too sweet to be refreshing.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Plenty of sweet banana is apparent in the aroma along with apple, a dash of wooden hops, and very light cloves. The flavor is more of the same with ample fruity esters and a barely bittersweet finish, thanks to the conservative use of hops. This is refreshing. Its light, but not too light, and well balanced and clean.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

4594,"2009-01-25",4.2,"Appearance: Cloudy, pale hay-colored body with a thin, white head that yielding light lacing on the way down.

Smell: Citrusy orange-scented aroma with a waft of lightly tangy wheat and a lesser background note of coriander. 

Taste: Mildly sweet pale malts with a lightly tangy wheat component. The addition of orange peel give it a sweet, freshly-squeezed juice flavor. A contrasting earthy spiciness from the coriander follows. Light spicy hops and bitterness. The coriander becomes a bit more pungent, lasting beyond the finish and into the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation.

Drinkability: Tasty and immensely refreshing. A mighty fine start to my inaugural trip to Terminal Brewhouse.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
