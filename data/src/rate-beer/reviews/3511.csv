The aroma is fairly nice with caramel, toasted almond, and some light chocolate.  Pretty much the same thing going on with the flavors; toasty caramel malt mixes with some lighter chocolate notes and perhaps a little mixed dried fruit.  I dont really get almond here.  This is very drinkable; carbonation is relatively high and spritzy.  This is a pretty solid brew, although I admit to be rather unexcited with it.

3511,"2012-01-16",3.7,"From notes.
On tap at cigar city.
This brew poured a deep mahogany brown with red hues where the light passed through, very little head on this mostly due to the pour, what did remain was on the yellow side of off-white.
The nose on this one was pretty roasty, notes of caramel, chocolate, and a bit of earthiness.
Up front I get those sweet malty flavors, chocolate and a little fruit I cant put my finger on. There are some earthy notes followed up by a bit of grassy hop.
The body is fairly light and the carbonation sits on the high side making this brew very drinkable.
Overall a nice drinkable beer, but nothing to wright home about.","New York, USA","BigSound"
