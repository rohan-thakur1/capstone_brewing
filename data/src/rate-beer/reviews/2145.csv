Flavor is complex with a prominent spicy bitterness throughout. Nice taste evolution to a dry bitter fruity finish. Medium carbonation. Very nice beer.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","Vaiz"
2145,"2009-12-22",3.9,"From draught at SMÖF. 
Copper colour with low head. Elegant smoke and juniper in aroma. Smokey backbone in flavour with with rounded mouthfeel. First ashes, then smoke, then ashes again in a clean, less fruity body. A bit of house character was sensed I believe, in terms of dark plum. Pretty light bodied and a fair bitterness was sensed. Great beer.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"
2145,"2009-12-09",4.1,"Tasted at the first, great, Borefts Beer Festival 2009 @ De Molen. Very nice story from the brewers about the origin of this beer. Amber, brown colored brew. Aroma is smoky, juniper, tree. Flavor is also a lot of the whole juniper tree that went in there. Smoke, malty, some hops. Nice brew, great.","Zeist, NETHERLANDS","NoiZe"
2145,"2009-11-28",4.0,"On tap at Örebro Öl & Whisky Festival. Pours a nice amber color with a white head. Very nice smoky, juniper twig aroma, also some light hops on a solid bready maltbase. Flavour is really good malty, with nice smoke, juniper, and light hops. Somewhat bitter finish. Medium to fullbodied. Very tasty and a fun experiment, more of this please!","Karlstad, SWEDEN","Ljunkan"
2145,"2009-11-27",4.0,"Draught at Örebro Öl- och Whiskeyfestival.  Clear brownish amber, fairly small head. Gotlandsdricke-like juniper twig aroma. Smokey with near full body and well rounded mouthfeel. The combination of strong juniper twig flavour and smoke makes it flavourwise very close to traditional gotlandsdricke, but the clean flavour profile, probably a result of bottom fermentation, makes it less fruity, estery and rustic. Finishes with slight bitterness. Damn good beer - and very interesting too!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2145,"2009-11-23",4.3,"A Mes rate. Draught at 1st Borefts Beer Festival.Amazing red amber colour with a thin but lasting off white head. Full on smoke and ashtray stuff but in the best way. Stunning juniper notes that are not over done at all. All the other juniper beers I have had have been awful, this was the exact opposite. The smoked malt is about the best I have had. Schlenkerla eat your heart out. Seriously. Excellent berry notes in the finish followed by even more smokiness. Its a real love or hate thing clearly, and it doesnt do a great deal but what it has, really hits the spot for me. Really enjoyed talking to the Narke guys about the making of this and the photos of the boiling tree were just hilarious!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
