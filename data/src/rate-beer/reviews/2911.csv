A more straight ahead fruit based one seems like it might be more up my alley--and it is. This is a pretty decent beverage. It is clear and headless. It is pretty single-mindedly cherry oriented but it has a nice, fresh, juicy taste that reminds me somewhat of New Glaruss fruit beers. It tastes like cherry juice dissolved in a sweet hard cider and that is basically exactly what it is. My only complains are that there is really not much honey character--maybe just a floral note around the edges--and I feel like the apple juicy texture would be improved if this were more effervescent. It finishes with some lingering sweetness and green apple tartness and overall is a nice, fresh , fruity tasting drink.

2911,"2014-06-03",3.4,"initial aromas and indeed my first taste were very positive. Rarely do I encounter apples, other fruit, and honey character so balanced and expressive. Cherries? heck yes. Apples? of course! Honey? Indeed! I even noticed the star thistle varietal. 
However, the admonition to ""drink cold, zombies hate the cold!"" is very true. It took only a few degrees of warmth, and the loss of the initial spritz of carbonation, before this went cloying on the palate. Too sweet. By my second bottle I had started drinking it ice cold, poured a few ounces at a time into a chilled glass, with the remainder stoppered in the fridge. Kinda silly to have to go to that extent to be able to finish a bottle; would love to see this in an off-dry form.","Kansas, USA","udubdawg"

Zombie Killer pours a light, mostly transparent peach raspberry color, with just a gentle suggestion of bubbly carbonation, but no cap to speak of.

The mead comes through in the nose first.  A nice sweet honey presence   preempts sweet cherries and some apple tartness.

There is a simple elegance to the flavor that I definitely appreciate.  The honey sweetness, semi-sweet but semi-tart cherries, and tart apples all play off each other nicely, resulting in a sweet cyser that is not over the top.  The finish is nice and clean.

It is definitely worth noting just how refreshing this is on the palate.  Even though it mostly lacks carbonation, it is light enough where the flavors seem to skate along my tongue.  The tartness toward the end of the sip causes me to salivate a bit, in a good way.  It cannot be overstated how smooth this is.

Taste is waxy, with a generous amount of cherry. Half tart apples bring up the back end, but the pie filling continues through. Absolute finish dries out with some grain flavor.

Body has some slight thickness & a light buzz of carbonation. Kind of like half flat soda.

2911,"2012-05-20",3.8,"Nice, though it took a minute for this to really sink in. The nose was very light and restrained but closer examination revealed a nice soft honey tone. Color was a pink salmon type color, light effervescence. Flavor was semi-sweet honey up front, light and restrained, light mouthfeel, hints of sour cherry and a semi-dry finish. In the end the honey notes were light but quite pleasing, and the cherry added a nice touch.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
2911,"2012-05-20",4.0,"Shared by someone at the Montes Krown tasting yesterday.  Ok, this is the first mead Ive ever had, and I gotta say, if all meads are this good, consider me a huge mead fan.  Pours a clear light pink.  Slightly funky and sour in the nose.  A bit sweet and cloying in the mouth, but has a nice sour/funk that I can get behind.  Pleasant.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"
2911,"2012-05-19",3.5,"Pale cherry.  The aroma is light cherry and hints of mead.  Balanced and clean with light fruitiness.  Very light carbonation.  Sweet honeyish finish with light fruitiness.

I thought the flavor was gonna be sweeter and Im glad it wasnt.... the flavor profile follows the nose with nice hints of sour cherry, ripe apple and a bit of floral rosey notes that have a similar winey flavor of a fruit heavy rose  Great summer session drink... enjoying now on a 70˙ day after working in the garden.

This is a very dry beverage with some tartness and sweetness balanced out.  It is like a nice dry apple or pear cider, but the tart cherries really bring out something interesting.  I could use a few more of these for the summer.","Alpine, California, USA","hamilton23"

2911,"2012-05-03",4.0,"Bottle at redlight. Blush colored, chill haze. Aroma rich with summery ripe red cherries, chardonnay yeast. The effervescence is mild, making it almost flat with a little lightness on the tongue. The palate is bursting, just bursting, with fresh bing cherries. Finishing resinous and clean. Lots of fun but very well made, so it's personality has a wonderful balance. Serious when it needs to be, and playful all the time. Great!

Flavor shows more sweet melon and sugary grape at front, mid is more biscuit,  honey sweetness returning through finish. Thick, sweet, but very smooth, the high, integrated sugar is a problem only if its a flavor issue. Not much cherry throughout, sugar overwhelms it.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Light carbonation. I really have had a hard time rating this one. Very well done, and dangerously easy to drink.

Flavor is absolutely stupendous! Beautiful cherry sweetness akin to New Glaruss really great fruit beers, but great complexity from the apple, honey, and not even remotely cloying.

2911,"2012-03-15",3.8,"500mL. Pours a clear rose champagne with brilliant clarity. Quick white foam. Champagne look. Nose is also rose champagne with white grape notes taken over by sweeter cherry pie. Very fresh and subtle with no sugar or plastic character. Taste is tangy and sweet with a quenching, clean palate. Hints of orange blossom honey and lime with tart cerise noire. Very much, for a non wine lover, like an upgrade from plasticy, bland champagne. Immensely enjoyable.

I know this is a mead but I have trouble finding the honey underneath the tart cherries. Taste is fairly sweet up front, hits with some apple and tart cherry midway then finishes fairly dry with a lingering cherry sweetness.

A: I know this isnt a beer, but this doesnt look very appealing, especially in a shaker glass. Crystal clear body almost champagne colored, a really pale amber with slight pink even. No head to speak of.

S: I dont care much for the scent, tarty cherries, but this reminds me more of a wine than anything, then again Im not used to meads.

T: Wow, this tastes way better than I was expecting, very sweet upfront with a very apple cider taste. Very clean flavor with the cider leading into the tart cherries rather quick with good balance. Theres a slight sweetness from the honey, but its very light. I couldnt drink this every day, but I definitely would love this with dinner instead of a wine.

P: Light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation that feels like little stabs on the tongue here and there. Very lively.

O: Im enjoying this, I picked it up for my girlfriend but its a nice change up from hoppy IPAs and thick stouts. This reminds me a lot of a more balanced Cerise in ways, though its probably because of the cherries.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

2911,"2011-12-16",4.1,"Bottle - Pours clear pink with no head at all. Nose is sweet honey, white grape, sweet apple, and a touch of vanilla and sweet cherry. Taste is a blast of honey sweetness that transitions into a tart cherry finish...wow. Really sweet and decadent, but the finish cuts off abruptly so it doesnt linger with crazy sweetness. Syrupy and smooth body with no carbonation. Wow...awesome stuff.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
2911,"2011-12-16",3.9,"Picked up a 500 ml bottle at the B. Nektar meadery near Detroit, Michigan. Pours a clear pink light white zinfandel colored cider/mead with a clean disk and no viscosity tears. Aroma of tart cherry, a hint of cider and very faint honey. Taste is light to medium bodied, cider/tart cherry and a hint of candi sugar. Finish is when the cherry really shines and has a slight lingering aftertaste that is pretty decent. Even served cold this cherrry cyser is quite refreshing.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
2911,"2011-12-16",3.7,"Bottle. Poured clear reddish pale color with good legs. Moderate tart fruit, honey and small alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a thick smooth texture and long legs. Medium tart fruit and honey flavor with a medium to heavy complex sweet finish of moderate duration. Pleasing smooth alcohol burn. Good mead.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2911,"2011-12-09",4.0,"Bottle.  Aroma has notes of green apples, honey, cherries, jolly ranchers and flowers.  Pale pink hue.  Flavor is very sweet and medium sour.  Palate is medium bodied and watery tart with a very soft carbonation.  Overall a really delicious brew that I would never get tired of.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
2911,"2011-12-03",3.0,"bottle...really light color, looks like a watered down white zin... the aroma is light cherries, sweet, candy... tastes good, but all juice, might as well be drinking juice, crushable but boring","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
2911,"2011-11-25",4.0,"500ml bottle purchased here in the city.  glad to see this getting distributed here in chicago... opens with a small hiss and yields a chardonnay like hue with a light tint of pink, a rose pink petal quality to it with a minimal ring around the colar soapy white head... the mead imparts itself into the aroma with a honey sweetness while a light cherry mingles effortlessly with it.  the majority though seems to be focused on the cider nature of this mead.  apple crisps, honeycomb, and marachino cherries all combined into one.  an apple focused kiddie cocktail, ha.  a touch sweet but there is mead involved so there... flavors do nothing as to persuade one in a different direction.  cidery for sure with a light apple vinegar bite that offers a touch of acidity.  cherry adds a layer of complexity while the mead offers up a mild degree of sweetness that eventually cuts short due to the light dryness of the cider.  light and easy to drink.  too easy to drink almost.  a belgian red light with apple cider and honey accents.  chicks will dig it, think you will too.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
2911,"2011-11-22",4.1,"Bottle:  The aroma consists of apple cider with some honey and lightly tart cherries.  It pours a dull light pink, bordering on peach colored, with some large soapy white bubbles that quickly fades to a very fine ring around the edges of the glass.  The flavor starts with lots of tart apples with the finish leaning more towards tart cherry.  Theres a touch of honey sweetness in the background, but its definitely the tartness of the apples and cherries that dominates.  Medium bodied with mild carbonation.  Overall, extremely refreshing and drinkable.  At $9 a bottle, its just going down way too quick.  This would be an expensive habit.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
2911,"2011-11-19",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a clear reddish amber with a small white head that dissipates completely. Aroma has a good amount of tart cherries with a hint of backing honey. Flavor starts with honey but is balanced by a nice cherry tart note. Quite drinkable.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2911,"2011-11-18",4.4,"Opened up a box that was sitting on the floor at belmont party supply and I was surprised to see something from b nektar. Since when do they distribute to ohio? I may need to go buy the rest of these. Pours a light pink color with a few bubbles. Aroma was apples and cherries. The honey added a nice sweetness to this that was balanced very well with the tart cherries. I havent had many cysers but this one is defintely the best so far.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"
2911,"2011-11-16",4.2,"Bottle in Detroit. Crystal clear, light pinkish appearance with no head. Sweet honey, mild apple, light cherry aroma. Slightly syrupy mouth feel. Somewhat spicy, cherry pie-like, rich honey flavor with a fairly tart cherry finish. Fuck this is good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
2911,"2011-11-13",4.3,"Pours pale pink, with a small ring of fine bubbles. Aroma is huge cherry, with notes of apple cider. flavor is much the same. Body is light & crisp.","Brownstown, Michigan, USA","rayl101"
2911,"2011-11-11",4.1,"Bottle. Thanks Mike! Pours a clear, pinkish hued color. Apple. pineapple, cherry, and strawberry in the nose. Light mouthfeel. Super cherry pie all the way. Sweet, cherry, with a bit of apple cider acidity to it. Very tasty. Smooth and drinkable. No appearance of alcohol.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"

2911,"2011-08-17",3.7,"At GTMW, but was the dry hopped version.  The mead pours to a blush colored wine.  The aroma was pretty much cherry honey and light piney hops.  The flavor was cherry wine, blush wine, light honey.  Honestly, tasted more like a wine than a cyser.  Very well done.  Hops were subtle.  Very easy drinking palate that hides the high ABV.  I preferred the B. Nektar Meadery Funky Monkey (I had it as Belle Isle Belgian-style melomel).","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
2911,"2011-06-04",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2016 Bottle... Farewell to ibrew2or3... Clear pink/rose mead. I really struggled, to no avail, to smell anything at all and came up with only a trace of cherries. Full-bodied and oily with modest carbonation. The flavor is fruity with heavy sweetness and medium acidity. Finishes sweet, then acidic and fairly dry. Bottle courtesy of meadme!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2911,"2011-06-02",4.2,"Thanks to askofficerfriendly for the share.  Pours a clear champagne yellow with a small white head.  Nose is sweet apples, honey, sweet and tart cherries, and honey.  Flavor is similar with an effervescent quality which cleans up nicely.  A bit drier than I would have imagined, but a very enjoyable mead.  The blend of flavors mixed with the carbonation makes this beer a balanced, enjoyable experience.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
2911,"2011-05-31",4.1,"Busy Bee Raleigh.   Spritzy carbonation.  honey, cherries,  lightly tart and sweet.  a wonderful mead","raleigh, North Carolina, USA","ucusty"
2911,"2011-05-29",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2012 Love the guys at B. Nektar and to think this one could be on draft one day in Florida makes me downright giddy.

Pours nice and light fizzy light champagne.  Aromas of fresh fall cider, and tart cherries.  Flavors of lightly spiced cider, a yin and yang of sweet and tart cherries, and a hint of sugary sweetness.  Sort of a different take on a blend of Belgian Red Raspberry tart blend.  Zippy carbonation made this one uber refreshing on a hot summer night.  Wonderful flavors makes this downright crushable.  My favorite beer (uh mead) of a very large tasting consisting of tons of rare and hyped brews.

2911,"2011-05-29",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2014 The best mead Ive ever had, by a long shot.  Nicely crisp carbonation, slightly tart and slightly sweet cherries, just tasted like a really great craft cherry soda with some tartness thrown in for good measure.  Awesome balance, thanks Greg!","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
