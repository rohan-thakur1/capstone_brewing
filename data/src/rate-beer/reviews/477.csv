477,"2017-02-20",3.4,"Appearance: Super creamy tan head with a dense black body. Look very good!

Smell: Surprisingly mute actually. I coaxed out some faint hints of cocoa and charcoal but not much more.

Taste: More charcoal (not harsh) with some coffee, bitter-sweet chocolate and an overall roasted character. Its a little to subtle for my tastes but it gets a little more complex as it warms. Some bitterness at the end, hops maybe? Still, not as rich as i would have liked.

Mouthfeel: Cant really complain here as its oh so smooth. Quite full bodied with a low carbonation. Feels as comfortable as a blanket.

Drinkability: No trouble at all here. I would gladly have another for sure but id probably opt for a pint instead of a glass.","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"

Bière noire comme la nuit à la mousse crémeuse, onctueuse, généreuse et montée à la manière dune meringue italienne. Look absolument irréprochable!

Parfums délicats et francs de café-crème vanillé. Je ressens aussi beaucoup de fumée mais tout celà est parfaitement logique et cohérent.

Poured a very dark black with a pretty nice creamy tan head. Pretty decent head and some lacing as it made its way down. The smell was pretty one dimensional with some roasted character and faint hints of coffee. Taste is pretty similar, with a tad bit of smoke and coffee, but nothing too much else. After being thrilled by many of Dieu du Ciels other beers, this one just didnt have all that much going on. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Pretty drinkable, but nothing too spectacular.

A mostly lasting average creamy brown head that tops up a hazy very dark black body. Heavy lacing. No visible particules. (beer is too dark to tell) Heavy filtration. Aroma presents malt being heavy burnt coffee/chocolate while hops are very faint earthy. Also, there are faint notes of licorice . Initial flavor is heavily acetic coffee and bitter chocolate while development is toasted bread like. moderate Finish is very long . medium body... but watery (?) intial texture that gets more rounded after a few seconds (thats wierd, i know) Soft carbonation...

Very enticing.  On draught March 2005 at the brewery.  Smells of medium-roast coffee and some licorice, with a graceful element of hops in the background, nor is the subtle chocolate lost on my nose.  Flavor begins with dark chocolate and strong roast overtones, moderately bitter and quite drying to start.  But as it proceeds on my palate, some dark, lightly salty, rich black chocolate emerges.  Its as if I have left a piece of chocolate to liquefy in my mouth.  Roasty reprise on the finish.
