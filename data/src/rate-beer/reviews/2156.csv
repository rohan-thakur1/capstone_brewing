2156,"2012-10-16",3.5,"Draught @ Oluthuone Leskinen. Hazy, dark yellow to brown sahti with dense fine head. Strong, sweet malty and caramelly aroma with heavy yeast phenols and some alcohol. Sweetish, slightly sugary flavor. Lacks malty depth. It is almost wheaty resembling weizenbocks to a degree. A punch of alcohol in the finish, as it should be. Juicy, rather full and oily texture with light carbonation (usually sahti is flat). Personally, I think that carbonation this light is OK. Not a benchmark sahti, but highly drinkable.","Oulu, FINLAND","esox"

Aroma is sweetish and rather high on banana esthers. Also some strawberries and yeast. Flavour has banana esthers, some alcohol and hints of strawberries. Also some yeasty savor occurs after some sips. Sticky and somewhat floury palate. The alcohol is mostly warming and disturbs only little. Becomes a bit boozy when warms up though. Could be more rich but good still.

Draught @ the brewpub. 2013 version.
Pours a slightly cloudy amber colour with a white head. Strong and pungent aroma of full-on juniper twigs,  juniper berries and wood. Flavour is pretty much the same as last year, but it has very little banana now. Juniper runs over everything, which is good. Yeast is well hidden. Id say this is much better than last year. 8-3-8-3-15 3.7","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"
