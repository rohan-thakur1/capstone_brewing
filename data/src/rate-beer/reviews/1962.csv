Im not a fan of many stouts that leave the heavy tobacco after-taste. This is a pleasant aroma, a pleasant taste and a pleasant, non-intrusive after-taste.

1962,"2011-09-15",3.8,"Draft CCB Fruit in the Room 2011 Pours black with a mid-sized, creamy, beige head. Excellent retention. The nose is very roasty and nutty, offering additional notes of dark chocolate and vanilla. Full-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and jazzy carbonation.

1962,"2011-09-01",4.0,"On tap at the Funky Buddha.  Black pour with a tan head.  Roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and coffee aromas.  The flavor is sweet with some lactose qualities that are counter by bitter dark roasted malts, coffee, and bakers chocolate.","Florida, USA","50belair"
1962,"2011-08-26",3.7,"Growler from the brewery.  Near black color that pours with a fairly thick tan head.  A thin layer of foam sticks around that allows for some scattered lacing.  The aroma is initially quite chocolaty.  Some coffee roast, ashy notes, and dark fruit eventually join in.  The body is slick and creamy, again, showing a healthy dose of milk chocolate flavors to go with a little bitter coffee roast, ash, and oats.  No real trace of the dark fruit that was in the aroma.  This is a little thinner and lighter than expected.  It drinks like it could be a couple ticks lower than 7%.  I really dont have much of a problem with that.  Drinkability, as long as flavor isnt sacrificed, isnt a bad thing.  Considering who brews this, it comes as no surprise that this is a very solid tasting stout.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Nose is nice amount of roast with pieces of licorice, earth, unsweetened dark chocolate, and black coffee.
