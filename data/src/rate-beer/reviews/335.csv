335,"2017-05-27",4.2,"750ml bottle at the 3 Fonteinen restaurant. Golden Blend Oude Geuze bottling date 12/12/2014. Aroma of dusty, musky, horse blanket, light to moderate vinegar, oak.

335,"2017-05-25",4.7,"kolor złocisty piana obfita dość szybko opada.
Zapach to czyste uderzenie spoconych koni husarii. xD A tak serio to jest mega dziko, troszkę skórek owoców w tle ale derka na pierwszym planie. Z czasem pojawia sie cytryna
smak jest wybitnie skórzany i cierpki jak niektóre owce. Czuć nuty gorzkich pomarańczy i ogólnie owocowe ale ciężko mi nazwać co to może być, może agrest? Kwaśność jak na Geuze to niska do umiarkowanej.

Darker than 3F Oude Geuze. Big head, no retention. Surprising. Faint, discrete bubbles.

Smells citrusy. Lemon and orange. Its more prominent than the funk. Deep earthy, but not overwhelming cheese aroma behind it.

Tastes extremely citrusy, which I didnt expect. Orange and lemon behind it. Less funk than the smell, but still an earthy oaky funk. Light body and very dry in the finish.

Light and very carbonated. Effervescent and dry. Sour, but not overly so.

335,"2016-08-10",3.9,"2011 375mL bottles consumed fairly young (Summer 2013) and again on 8/3/16.Great pour to it, with large amounts of white head showing moderate to moderately-strong retention for the style. Clear, brass-golden body shows fine carbonation.The nose is full of brett, as youd expect from 3F, with huge amounts of soft lime, hickory nut skin and very light band aid. Its atop a seemingly dry malt/wheat base showing bits of biscuit and honey. Some very light oak, but in the background, with mineral, wet hay and light horseblanket. Its very ""lively"" with lots of tangy fruit and such, though it doesnt (to me) remind anything of Blauw. Still, its wonderfully clear, funky and bright with, of course, no flaw or alcohol.In the mouth, it proves quite delicate, with strong attenuation, as expected, fine carbonation and a soft, wheat-like texture. Hay, horse, tons of brett acids and just a hint of honey on the end mixing with light oak, pleasantly. It does gain quite a bit of green apple, not really seen from the nose, which is odd. Im not the biggest fan of green apple character in lambics. It sort of reminds of Boon, whose lambics I dont care for. Other than that, its got all the makings of a light, bubbly, easygoing and very drinkable gueuze.  I also preferred it more when it was younger, as the flavors all seemed brighter, sharper and more challenging.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Preparation: Fridged bottle, popped at 10°C -12°C (within recommended temperature of 14°C) onto a Westmalle chalice.

Looks: Translucent amber liquor colour with a ring of dirt-like yeast sediments; No head, no foams, no lacing nor carbonation detected.

Aroma: Very fragrant and tart aroma of malt, with strong red wine, Port wine, Balsamic vinegar, strong yoghurt, grape skins, strong funk, strong tannic, wood barrel and strong lemon.

Taste: Strong sour taste of malt, with strong funk, strong grape skins, moderate Balsamic vinegar, strong yoghurt, red wine, strong wood barrels, strong tannin, strong lemon, strong bitter hops and light grass.

Body: Close to light body. Thin and quite slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Wow, nothing prepares me for this! Funky to start, then with very strong but pleasant yoghurt tartness and strong grape skins and tannin, complimented by moderate red wine and Balsamic vinegar. Strong barrel make it like an aged wine. Not in-your-face but mature and delicious!

Hoppiness / Tannic: Strong lemon and grape skins in nose. Strong lemon, very astringent grape skin, strong tannic and light grass in taste. Bitterness is moderate to strong for a lasting, very astringent winey finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Funky, very winey and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is a definite step up to the original Oude Geuze. Its a lot bolder in tartness, yet very expressive in the barrel and winey taste. The total lack of head and carbo doesnt matter, as the sophisticated taste and feel make up for it. A winner for Christmas!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Crisp onset with a lot of spritzy, champagne-like carbonation tickling the tongue and enlightening the body; lots of fruity esters as expected, with hints of gooseberry, fresh lemon, pink grapefruit and blueberry, drying acidity as expected but in a somewhat mellow, gentle kind of way, not as puckering and lemony as in more classically made oude geuzes, though lemon acidity is certainly there, stretches deep into the finish and is in beautiful balance with the calmer lactic acidity; a notably (very) dry white wine-like character appears in the middle and stays till the end, supported by clean barley and wheat flavours in the background. Finish is truly beautiful: the ongoing drying lemon peel acidity still balanced with the soft lactic tartness, a softly bittering earthiness of old hops for structure, a drying woodiness and a retronasal feast of sweetish and sourish fruity esters and the infamous horseblanket. The aftertaste seems deeper, thicker, more sherryish (even very vaguely sweetish) and also more bitter than that of the regular version. Difficult to judge: this is a splendid example of the style for sure, but I cannot quite decide whether I like it more than the regular one. Just absolutely great, lets say, and without a doubt different from his regulary made oude geuze not just in composition, but in terms of flavour as well.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Upon loosening the cage, the cork came out with a loud pop. Lots of pressure but not a gusher at all. Pours a very hazy, dark golden orange color with tangerine edges and a two finger yellowish-beige head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Streaks of soapy lacing left behind. 

Musty, funky aroma with a strong barnyard presence along with lactic funk, citric acidity and light fruit. Earthy with lots of oak, cobweb, grass, wet hay and horsebkanket followed by lactic cheese, lemon juice and green apple. Smells very inviting but it seems like the four year old portion of the blend tones things down a bit. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with tight carbonation and a tart, puckering flavor that lingers over the lactic funk, citrus, light fruit and pale malt into a crisp, dry finish. Aggressively sour at first but not harsh or overly acidic with lots of earthy oak, lactic funk and sweet citrus balancing things out. As it warms, the lactic cheesy presence stands out a bit more and the citrus acidity becomes a bit more tart. Earthy with toasted oak, grass and hay notes countered by lemon peel and green apple flavors. Funky and sour but well balanced and very quaffable and refreshing once the palate adjusts. I could drink gallons of this stuff if it wasnt so damn expensive.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

335,"2014-06-02",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2016 Oude geuze Golden Blend 14 vintage

Pours a saturated, bright, golden-amber color, with a small, fizzy head, receding to a thin, bubbly texture at the rim of the glass. 

On the nose, the beer produces an incredibly intense funkiness. It features green apple peel, crisp citrus wrapped up in blue cheese, leather, prickling mushroom, jogurt, and most surprisingly a pleasant floral note. All those flavors blend together marvellously, creating a very harmonious, aroma bursting impression. 

Has a soft, medium carbonation with a pleasant mouthfeel to it, refreshing due to citrus and mineralic tones, silk on the tongue due to a buttery, leather defined maltiness.

Tastes of a slowly unfolding citrus crispness, featuring a luscious sourness, next to a more and more pungent developing dryness. Dusty old earth produces a great balance, with a moldy toffee sweetness to be found in it. Its carbonation adds a vivid component to the drinking experience, masking the bigger body of this perfectly well. Finishes with an intense, mineral supported, citrus dryness among fermented green apple, sun bathed hay and a wheaty sweetness.

A treat throughout, pushing the already best Geuze even further. Everything I love about their regular Gueuze is detectable in this, while they amped it up a bit. Best example for this being the nose, promising an uncompromising funkiness, countered by its characteristic crispness on the palate, achieving an intriguing synergy, which lasts till the end. Unbelievable depth of flavors, while its balance is just spot on.","GERMANY","aleigator"

335,"2014-03-01",4.4,"Look: Pours with huge, fizzy, big bubbles, off-white (orange hue) head. Fast retention, not the most beautiful, but hey, thats what you get with forced, fizzy carbonation. Leaves a relatively nice layer on top, fair amount of sticky lacing. Cloudy, dirty orange. Not the most impressive, but the looks arent why this beer is superb.


Smell: Sour strawberry notes are the strongest, fresh figs second, but a lot more going on here. The smell is fresh, different notes from apples to dry white wine, oak, lactic acid, cider like. Then the funk part - must say the most pleasant funk Ive ever smelled. Smooth, hypnotizing, musty, leathery, barnyard - all perfectly balanced with fruity sour notes. Complex mixture, but works so well together. 


Taste: Light sweet pale, grainy malt at start, then the sour comes over it and kicks your senses. Sour transitions from fruity berries (a little less obvious than in the smell), lactic, even some acetic acid tart, then the enhanced citrus (lemon) zest close to the end. Funk tuned down a bit, still smooth musty, leathery notes. Sour intensity from medium to high, a little less when the beer warms up. Aftertaste consists mostly from zesty sour with some brilliant strawberry and oak notes at the far end. 


Mouthfeel: Fresh, crisp, fizzy carbonation, medium body. Very dry and coats your mouth with time. Classic geuze.


Overall: The smell is mind-blowing. Complex, balanced, smooth, the most impressive funk witnessed. And the taste that follows does its job (maybe a bit high on sour for my taste, but hell, cant complain about that). Superb and well worth your time and money.","SLOVENIA","tmzl"

A - Pours was honestly a pain. Huge amounts of foam made it take forever but once it settled it left slightly hazy amber orange liquid. It eventually dissipated down to a sticky white film leaving small webs of lace down the side of the glass.


S - Smells of strong drie fonteinen barnyard funk, light basement must, bit of lemon tartness and some earthen mineral. The funk is pretty strong throughout, just as I prefer it to be.


T - Taste is a little more balanced compared to the nose. Starts off with still strong barnyard funk and light must quickly giving way to hints of oak, lactic sourness, lemon tartness and some light graininess. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Some robust carbonation helps drum up the funk to match the tartness, making it really easy to consume.

Over the years Ive pretty much fallen out of love with sour beers, but I still revisit now and then for fun...theyre neat in their own way, but I just dont crave the bacteria-laden stuff anymore. That said, Drie Fonteinen has long been a favorite in this genre, so visiting Akkurat meant perusing the bottle list. And when I spotted this, I decided it was about time to say hello to Armands handiwork again, partly because its a 2-3 year old bottle and thus in the typical sweet spot for geuze. This takes me back to my visit to Heeren van Liedekercke many years ago to sample the special 3F J&J blends...this has the same sort of mastery of blending that those had; its very sour but not TOO sour (near perfect balance for my tastes), its remarkably complex aromatically and almost shockingly fruity (as if peaches were added, seriously) with zero undesirable odors, and overall its pretty much impossible not to love.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
335,"2013-11-25",4.4,"Aroma has a nice complex character to it with medium acidity. Moderately strong barnyard funk with horse blanket and hay. Medium herbal character. Light citrus character and light pineapple and cherry pie notes.
Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange with hints of copper and a small fairly thin slightly off white head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges.
Flavor is similar to the aroma with a nice moderate, but soft acidity. Strong barnyard notes with horse blanket and hay being very noticeable. The flavor also has a moderately strong herbal character - not quite mint but similar and very nice. Medium light citrus character with some pineapple and tropical fruit. Hints of cheery pie and medium light oak notes.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.
Overall this is a damn fine geuze and still young. This beer has a lot of room to improve with age, especially in the herbal qualities. Nice soft acidity and balanced funkiness. I am really impressed with this beer and its complexity.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

The cork always comes off with some force... some bottles are gushers, others are not. Cloudy, dull golden body with a quickly fading & fizzling white head; no lacing left behind. Aroma is pungent with sour fruits & fortified funk. Green apples, lemon, white grape, acidity, dry oak, barnyard hay, cork, musky cellar notes, plenty of lacto through & through. Sour & funky, bottom line. Taste is so tart... puckering full of sour apples, lemons, grape skins, borderline astringent, light acidity, lacto abound. Belgian funk, cork, damp wood, tame horseblanket character. Faint cherry notes with warmth, too? Great balance of flavors, super tart without gut wrenching acidity.

I didnt really want to drink lambic tonight, but I was out of other beer and this bottle has been ""on deck"" forever, so I figured it was time. Cork popped out as soon as I untwisted the cage. Incredibly aromatic and intense nose, filled with marzipan, freshly hewn oak, gooseberries, and straw. Flavors are somehow milder and less effusive than the aroma, but in their own delicate and subtle way present a graceful suite of wheatgrass, ruby red grapefruit juice, and cream of wheat cereal. Elegant and almost brandy-like in the finish, despite a really fresh lightness that Ive had in very few lambics. Distinct and unique. Fantastic.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

-The flavour profile is not as tight as their regular Gueuzes.
-Carbonation is very intense.
-Humid bread crumbs show up here and there.
-That acidity is long lasting to say the least.

When had side by side with the regular Oude Gueuze, it actually seemed a bit cleaner and less cheesy/corky. The flavor came across as a bit cleaner as well, still plenty of cellar funk and super dry though. I think the addition of the 4 year old stuff did add a bit of an aged character to it. Still cant say that I enjoyed it as much as the regular Gueuze though, and its certainly not worth the two to three times markup over the regular ($30/375ml at Julios in Mass, WTF?). Bone dry and fizzy with a lingering citrus rind finish. Pretty delicious stuff, I wish it were a little more affordable here in the states.

335,"2013-05-09",3.7,"Opened up for game 5 of the Hawks-Wild playoff series. Poured into a vintage Oud Beersel tumbler. Pours a translucent brownish yellow/orange in color with about a fingers worth of off-white head. There is excellent head retention for minutes after pouring. Nose is uncharacteristically faint for a 3F gueuze to me, maybe it just hasnt opened up enough yet? Faint lemon rind, stone fruit, must, and horse blanket. The flavor is more alive despite being a little muted still. Sharp lemon rind, a healthy dose of mineral, and some gentle funk on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little watery and light, but the carbonation is lively, the acidity is puckering, and the finish is moderate in length. Ive liked every bottle Ive opened of this so far, but this seems to be a little bit of a letdown for some reason. For the money, Id much rather just have an OGV or an aged 3F Oude geuze. Regardless, Armand is still the man and this is delicious.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"

I had to pull back the first time I put my nose in the glass, before I could appreciate  all the floral and fruity aromas radiating through the brettanomyces: berries, pear, peach, macintosh apple, cherry. The taste is sharply acidic, with flavors of wild fruits and plants (familiar to me, in Canada): wild raspberry and gooseberry, sweet clover, and lilac petal. It leaves a pleasant after-taste of grapefruit while the unending acidity cleans the enamel off your teeth. Im not even half- joking here.

Fruity sour old green apples with brett, earth, wood, apple wine vinegar and some soft hints in the aftertaste that strongly reminds me of gastric acid.

Initial aroma was sour lemon, but that turns into some barnyard, funk and old, dry leather later on. Just like being in the countryside on a farm on a warm summerday. Something that is light fruity, perhaps some white grapes that is, is as well there. Dry and quite tart, still theres that fruityness in the background as well. Light wooden oakiness, earthy funkiness and lemon in taste. Seems like this one is extremely well balanced. Tasty and delicious, theres the mild fruityness, light sweetness and the sour notes of gueuze working well together and making this one quite remarkable. A real treat.","FINLAND","RexTalionis"

Not only did the cork almost rocket out but the head was unstoppable and even with a slow pour took forever, probably because I refuse to allow any of the sediment into my glass. Now I am going to jump ahead and say that this is a fantastic geuze overall but I probably wont buy any more unless I can slip it into an overseas order. Its great its just not light years ahead of the regular oude geuze. The appearance was beautiful, thick orange, milkshake fluffy head, perfect glassware. The aroma is pretty great, quintessential geuze, wheat, sour orange slices, maybe the slightest bit of oak, honey. Flavor is pretty fucking good, very round and mildly fatty, does not make me pucker at all. Grass, pepper, very tame lemon flavor, this is pretty exquisite. As I move through the glass I can admit that yes, this is better than the normal 3F geuze in the same way that the Oude Geuze Vintage and Armand 4 series are better. Masterful stuff. Beautiful geuze.

I was expecting a bit more from a brewery like 3F. This is a passable geuze though not up to the level of others. Maybe it was a bad bottle but I am a bit indifferent about this one. Thanks to tastybeer for sharing regardless. A new lambic is always worth sampling.

Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy golden body was partially a result of agitation. A rusty white head sits on top like dusty snowcaps. Carbonation is so active it looks like soda water with a dash of food coloring. Mineral water and polished gold give the high notes of a sour tang. This is certainly acidic but not as sharp as I expect a Belgian sour to be.

Flavor / Palate - The lemony taste is on the mark. Along for the ride are orange peels, which do not feel as crisp as I wanted them to. This is more sour than most beers but because of such high expectations falls short in the end. The problem comes with the price tag. At close to $20 a pop I can choose many other things in its place.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

335,"2012-12-28",3.7,"Very aromatic Gueuze, with more Brett notes than Im used to from 3F, smelling from a whole meter away as soon as the bottle is popped open. Hard to pour with its extremely vivacious carbonation that generates an eternal white tower atop the bubbly gold. Intense lemon aromas in which the wheat comes across neatly, adding an oily feel to this otherwise bone-dry offering. Extremely attenuated, yet not overly thin. Its bubbles deserve some time to settle down a bit because it feels rougher than what this producer usually delivers in terms of mouthfeel elegance. Champaign-like indeed, including the earthy, salt cracker and nutty rancio notes. In mouth, its acidity is very serious, adding a soft acetic suggestion to the lactic and citric showdown. A beer could be blended with citrus juice, it would not get much more citrusy than this. And in the second half, a surprisingly salty attack joins the parade and seemingly dry the beer out farther. It is pretty good stuff, but I miss the ironically exuberant elegance of what I feel are the very top notch 3 Fonteinen. It makes for a rougher, less drinkable drink that yet remains very refreshing.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The beer is orange in color with just a slight haze about it. Ample carbonation present and a gargantuan head with seemingly everlasting retention and copious lacing. I just wish yourefragile hadnt absconded with my 3F tumbler, as this would have been a perfect occasion for it. Alas...

Wow, what an aroma. World class lambic anyone? Hay, barn, grass, citrus, funk. Whoa. The citrus quality is remarkable.

335,"2012-12-06",4.3,"375ml bottle purchased at west lakeview.  bottling date of 12/17/2011. second occasion having been able to try this.  the first was with the owner of novare res who is one stand up guy but i digress... cork opens with a pop, there was some pressure built up behind there.  the pour yields a hazy orange, semi-translucent, apricot colored composition allowing for a little light penetration while topped with a heafty soapy white head that took a few minutes to settle down before being able to top off... aroma is musty with that genuine geueze like horseblanket nose. accents of lemon and hay throughout.  not sure why theres a tendency for me to use lemon as a descriptor but i think the idea gets across as a citrus like basement sourness.  somewhat sharp and cheesy in just the right way... flavors dont let up much from the what the aroma had to offer.  sharp semi-acidic musty horseblanket upfront, lemon and hay that collide or shall i say meshing with lively dry carbonation that adds a prickly sensation to the tongue.  rather tart overall and just the way it should be, in my opinion which fades and ultimately leaves an earthy dryness on the sides of the mouth.  easy to drink and leaves you wanting to grasp for more.  should probably do a side by side with the regular geueze to discern more similarities or disimilarities but at this pricepoint,  this cant be regular habit of mine although i with that it could be.  splendid.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Dense, salty, funky nose: lots of salt upfront, lemony tartness and vibrant acidity and a restrained dose of funk: pinpoint, salty, lemony, mouthwatering lambic. Medium body; effervescent; forward acidity and plenty of funk and tartness; the core focus here is a focused lemony acidity and tartness coupled to a funky and highly salty framework; the salinitys a bit more amplified here than in some of their other limited-release lambics, and this doesnt quite match up to some of the Armand releases in terms of drinkability and layered qualities, but a damn fine salty and assertive lambic; touches of soft oak around the perimeter.

335,"2012-11-27",4.1,"375 ml bottle from Binnys SL (Chicago, IL). Opened as a Post Boxing Up 5 Trades Treat. Pours a richer deep golden amber hue, darkness in the body, good haze, and some deeper amber glow throughout. A huge head is offwhite, laces well, sticks around firmly. Well carbonated as the cork pops immediately upon uncaging but doesnt gush. Aromas are a rich melange of sour fruit, lemon and melon, oranges and crab apple. Gentle pear, straw, and doughy bread. Lactic lemony and yogurty sourness, some sweet tarts, firm funkiness grows, horseblanket, straw, and gentle cobwebs. A kiss of leather, richer oak presence on the nostrils as some bigger fruit elements, firmly sour, keep me quite interested. As it settles more funk comes forward, but still Id call it a richer firmly sour fruit presence, moving into a more funky dry backend on the nose. Initial is quite nice, dry and a bit earthy up front, lively carnonation on the palate, gentle crab apple and pear, melon, sour lemons and gentle bready dough. Lactic yogurt, lemony sourness, and more fruit, bigger melon and crab apple feel at times. Firmly sour, but not overwhelming at all, the middle shows more yogurt, straw, and dough. Sweeter fruit elements make their case here, melon and apple, pear, kiss of honeysuckle and white wine. Dough, gentle spice. Backend gets a bit more tart again, more funk and cobwebs, horseblanket, grass, and straw. Gentle sweat, cobwebs, and dry funky brett. A touch of saddle, the funk only comes on into the backend and finish, the nose leads you to believe there would be a bit more. Lingering sour lemon, melon, and apple.. Gentle dough, firm yogurt and straw, dryness and funk. The oak in this beer comes and goes, mellow then a bit more firm, dying out a bit more but coupling with the dry stages well. Overall, when compared to the regular Oude, its a bit more vibrant, sour and fruity elements give some nice complexity and make it a touch more special for me. Finish is dry and tart, lactic and funky. Dry and mellow, with lingering touches of fruit, sourness, and gentle yet inviting funk. Quite a nice beer, if I say so. Id like to buy a few to put away if I just had $100 laying around. With that said, everyone who likes Lambic and Sour beer should try it.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

335,"2012-11-03",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2014 Bottle (375 ml). Beautiful and almost clear golden with a small white head and some lacing. Aroma of apple, wood, fruits, leather and funky notes.

Nice complexity and impressive balance that make this beer dangerously drinkable and enjoyable. Another great blend by Armand! 9-4-8-4-17 = 4.2

EDIT: Its 3 years after bottling date now and the beer already started to develop the superb minty touch that theres in almost all old 3F gueuzes. Its also superb... huge fully lasting white head. Still quite smooth... tastier than the last bottle I had and it definitely gained some depth and complexity. A 0.3 bump for the moment (+0.1 for the appearance, +0.1 for the taste and +.01 for the overall...  and almost a 10/10 on the aroma), but Im confident it will continue to get better with time. 9-5-9-4-18 = 4.5","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Pours a golden color with a small but well retained head. 

The aroma is remarkably funky & dusty. Some horse sweat, some limestone, and some nice lemony character. Everything is well integrated, everything is pungent, but nothing is rude or out of place. 

The flavor is very lemony, nicely sour... perhaps on the higher end of sour, particularly for 3 Fonteinen. A nice fruitiness, some rind (both the cheese and citrus kind). The flavor is earthy a little briny, complex, and well woven together. The depth of flavor, and the pungency of the flavors in this are remarkable but the lambic is so carefully blended that everything works pleasantly and in its own way. 

The palate is sharp, and bubbly interesting, & not overly prickly... if Gueuze is supposed to be as bubbly as Champagne then this falls short, but it doesnt matter a bit the mouthfeel works perfectly well to carry the flavors of this beer, I dont know that I would want it more bubbly than it is.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

The flavor is down right sublime with bright notes of grapefruit rind, tangerine, subtle oak and soft but complex acidity that feels luxurious on the palate.

A - Clear dark amber body. Tons of off white foam after the initial pour, settles down into a neat one finger high head with some large bubbles. Lots of rising carbonation. Great lacing and retention. I rarely give out 5s on appearance, but it just looks damn perfect.

S - Balance is the one word that comes to mind. Earthy brett funk, lemon rind, sour green apples, rubber bands, and oak barrel. Its all very intense and concentrated, but its just so well integrated.

T - More of that great balance. Earthy funk, cheese, vinegar, oak, sour lemons, and some light vanilla tannins. Incredibly complex and layered. This gueuze is beyond delicious. The finish is dry and abrupt with only a lingering lactic presence. Mouth feel is spritzy and well carbonated. 

O - Armand can blend some of the best gueuzes out there, and this one ranks right up there.

335,"2012-09-22",4.7,"375 ml. bottle split by 4. Procured @ Hopduvel. Man this baby is carbonated, luckily that I anticipated this. Once i loosened the cage a bit, the cork began moving upwards, I had to forsibly hold it down so that it wouldnt hit the ceiling, first time that this happened to me honestly but still no gusher. I tried pouring slowly but I still got pretty much a full glass of mousse-like fluffy head and very little in the way of beer. Slowly the head began collapsing forming mountains. The beer itself is a very hazy, murky orange. Smell is huge horse-blanket funk with plenty of old 3F in there with some of that neat earthly mushroom thing going on, lots of this tad earthly citrus, some minor fruitiness and cleaner wood. Taste clearly carries quite a bit of that old 3F mushroom funk, tad lessened by the newer a bit less awesome old blend that they use, lots of horse-blanket, murky, some earthly citrus and tad earthly tangerines, as usual not much in the way of vinegar, wood and lightly burned caramel. Murky, hazy body with nice carbonation. This is more in the trend of just an older 3F geuze - like that is a bad thing. Awesome like any    blend that Armand makes - he is just that good. I do prefer a bit the clearness and brett-ness of young one more for everyday drinking and its easier for the wallet as well. It is a steep price but you do get more or less what you paid for, might have been a tad cheaper but ok. Hope that he is now finally out of the 4 yr old 3F lambic because frankly the amount of beers made with it are suspicious.

335,"2012-09-13",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2013 I picked up 6 of these in Belgium in May. Have sent 2 away to friends and finally enjoying this myself and making a review. I dont have a gueuze glass so I am enjoying this at cellar temp (55 today) in a Riedel white wine glass. Bottle date, 11/02/2011. Best by 02/2021.

A - This is a GUSHER! The cage was just barely untwisted about 2 turns when the cork shoots and makes a dent in my ceiling. WOWOWOW! Gorgeous color. Bright golden orange with an insane amount of carbonation bubbles traveling from the bottom of the glass to the top. Looks like a champagne. I poured as slow as possible and the head was still 5 fingers. Very big pillow like solid white head with tight bubbles at the bottom and big puffy bubbles at the top. After 4 minutes, head was 3 fingers. Its dropping very slowly. Lacing is impossible to avoid. A single swirl returns me to 5 finger head. 

S - The smell is almost as great as Armand4 (Lente). Huge notes of grass, lemon juice and an incredible amount of hay. Hints of wheat as well and fresh cut grass. There is no hint at all of vinegar or cider. The very horseblanket and musty characters persist through the back of my throat via very excited nostrils. Wow!

T - Huge lemony taste up front. Like sucking on a freshly peeled lemon slice. Hint of very farmhouse style Belgian yeast. Theres absolutely no sweetness but a big oaky presence at the finish is very persistent and sticks around. It has this almost ball-park pretzel taste. Bready, chewy and hints of salt. Took me a while to pinpoint it. Utterly delicious and much softer than expected. Absolutely no harsh tastes in this gueuze.

M - Solid carbonation but nothing overpowering. Medium body which was surprising and this oak finish that I love matched so well with a tart bite.

O - I LOVE the 3 Fonteinen Lente. It was an amazing beer. I have but have not tried the other 3 Armand seasons nor have I had the coveted Millenium Geuze. However, this is by far my favorite Gueuze from the master-blender Armand. Im very happy to have many more of these and experience how it progresses over time.

Really earthy and musty up front with the citrus kicking in through the middle.  The finish is very dry and crisp.  There is also a bit of mineral character in the taste as well as oak and a light acidity.

Cork damn near took my eye out as soon as I took off the cage, though it wasnt a gusher. VERY well carbonated, with a MASSIVE head, no matter how carefully poured. Pours a lightly cloudy deep amber/copper, with the aforementioned inches thick white head, but the lacing is quite poor. Nose is a bit tarter than usual, if I had it blind, I might pick this out as a gentle Cantillon, rather than a more asertive 3 Fonteinen, lots of sweaty horse, plenty of white grapes, leather, grass/straw, seems to be missing a bit of ""oomph"" in the midle of the nose though... Flavours are nicely sour, very round, very broad and dry, with plenty of salty complexity. Lots of damp barnyard straw, delicate sourness, big, robust body.

335,"2012-07-13",4.1,"A steady pour into my Large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a one finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is  light amber color that sows a almost clear, orange-amber tinged, full gold color. The aroma smells musty, lactic, slightly woody, musky, funkily phenolic, touches of urea, and just a bright, sharp acidity. A nice grain character comes through as the beer warms up and contributes nutty pale grain notes, a touch of straw, and even a hint of grassiness. I could smell this one for days, there is nothing quite like the aroma of a good, complex Gueuze.

This has a sharp acidity to it without being overly aggressive, but this is certainly has a full on sourness. The acidity accentuates a touch of sour grapefruit character, and perhaps some lemon like notes, but it is certainly full on Lactic. There is enough carbonation to contribute a liveliness and a carbonic bite towards the finish. This has that perfect Gueuze body in that it somehow has a certain fullness to it, but remains light and quaffable. The finish has a phenolic character to it that is slightly medicinal, definitely musty and funky, and perhaps a touch plastic like. Notes of urea, a touch of apple, and grain notes of hay, nutty rustic white bread notes, and some hay like flavors add some extra complexity.

As compared to the Bambic I had earlier, this is clearly a certifiable Gueuze Lambic. This is very nice, and I wish I had a few more bottles of this stocked; a 375ml bottle of a good Gueuze is never enough, and actually my glass of this is gone way to soon, as I am clearly wanting more of this than I have.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

335,"2012-04-25",3.9,"Poured into a tulip. 2011 vintage, which is given a 10 year lifespan.

4.0 A: Lots of carbonation in this. The cork started moving as soon as I started twisting the cage. It took more than a few pours to fill the glass up due to the plentiful head. Well hazed (probably from the many pours) light orange brown color. Big frothy white head. Good retention and plentiful lacing.

4.5 S: Lots of fruity funk in this. Plenty of apple with lemon backing it up. Lots of farm aromas in this - apple orchard, dry wood from a barn, hay, livestock. Mildly cheesy and minor musty notes. Not very sour smelling, but plenty of tangy lactic acid giving it the pleasant fruitiness.

4.5 T: Like the nose, this is very fruity and funky. Apple is all through this. Light lemon zestiness underneath. Super woody, but not all from the oak. More like dry, dusty planks of wood. Slightly metallic. Light, though appreciated, cheesiness. Load of lactic acid and perhaps a touch of acetic as well. Less ""barny"" than the nose suggested, but much more earthy. Wet grass, apple orchard, rotting wood, and must.

3.5 M: Normally Id probably give this at least a 4.0, but Im pretty sure the Armand4s have spoiled just about every other gueuzes mouthfeel for me. Very active, spritzy carbonation. Good there, but missing the creaminess that the seasons gave me.

4.5 D: Very tasty, super complex gueuze. Im more than happy that I purchased a few more.

335,"2012-04-09",4.6,"Bottle from overseas. Served in a Drie Fonteinen ""3"" gueuze tumbler side-by-side with Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze bottled on November 18, 2010. The Golden Blend was bottled on February 17, 2011.

The cork started to pop out right after I started to release the cage. Its not a gusher, but this thing has plenty of carbonation. The pour was difficult, to say the least. Loads of foam leading to a very rocky, dense head that leaves behind a nice bit of lacing. Thin cap throughout.

The nose brings an incredible amount of funk and is reminiscent of the Armand4 Herfst and Winter. This is what I love. There some minerality and an earthy mushroom-like character, coming close to a light bit of truffle. Some sweat and goatiness comes along after that. Some backing acidity comes through, leading into the flavor.

First impression in the flavor is sweaty horse blanket mixed with some strong earthiness. Straight from the ground here. Theres some acidity and must that really longer. A bit of leather and very light oak. This is an absolutely gorgeous beer. The acidity and funk flow right into one another. Simply sublime.

The body is light, bordering on light-medium. Pod carbonation and a mild acidity. Heavy funk and earth at every turn. Spritzer-like carbonation. Everything about the body helps to deliver the maxim amount of funk.

En bouche, je ne vois pas vraiment de grande nouveauté venant de lusage de lambic de 4ans. Palais est sec, note de grange, cave gardant une pointe sucrée qui pourra satténuer avec les années. Fin de bouche sec, fleuri. Le tout reste très jeune, vraiment à laisser en cave qcq années.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

335,"2012-03-24",4.7,"A1: EXPLOSIVE POP! This beer was so excited for me to try it that it couldnt help but rocket launch the cork off the top as soon as I twisted the cage far enough. Hazy, medium golden orange. 4+ (big, bubbly white) fingernail head, that dissipates to almost nothing fairly quickly, on soft pour. A2: Smells like a farm (in the best way possible) on a warm summer day - dry barnyard funk, cracked hay, and must. Touch of fruit, soft oak, and more funk. Open-arms inviting! T: Lots going on here. Upfront lemon rind and citrus are combined with smooth tartness (touch of green apple) followed by immediate funk. Middle to back includes mild (fruit) sweetness right before the classic gueuze sourness. Just as the sour fades there is a touch of very distinct, robust earthiness that rounds out this masterpiece wonderfully. Bravo! P: Medium body with loads of carbonation. Prickly on the tongue, but in such a good way. So easy to drink my glass was empty too fast. O: All-around this beer is beautifully blended and put together! I can definitely understand, support, and appreciate the name and think/hope this will only develop into another superb gueuze as it grows older. Considering how young it is at the moment, I was very impressed. I do think it needs a bit of age before reaching its peak, but it drinks amazingly well for where it is right now. Well done (again) Armand on a beer that will fill my cellar and make me smile for many years to come!","5280, Colorado, USA","spdyfire83"
335,"2012-03-23",4.1,"Corked bottle, courtesy of Alex (nightfall)Hazy deep blond color; medium sized head, a thin layer is persistent. The aroma is very pungent, a punch actually in the beginning; powerful and elegant Bretts, perfectly balanced. Tart and astringent flavor, you can feel some old and some young element, with a strong astringency and some lemon peel feeling; salty; maybe too astringent and a bit harsh to reach the highest spots, but still very good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

335,"2012-03-13",4.0,"38cl, new exclusive brew Anno 2012, from De Hopduvel Gent, very complex sour brew, woody/bitter and slightly fruity, very balanced, hazy, good head, very good brew, yet very expensive!","Gent, BELGIUM","BoBoChamp"
335,"2012-03-09",4.4,"Pours golden bronze with a huge white head that recedes quite fast.  Nose is sour fruits, slight vinegar, some great barnyard funk and leathery notes.  Flavor is sweet and sour througout until the finish hits after than its a very long sour aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is silky and creamy.  The addition of a four year old lambic has made a huge change to the beer.  Outstanding.","San Diego, California, USA","dreadnord"
335,"2012-03-09",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2012 I had this one together with Armand in his storage place a few km further then the brewery/shop. So in between the new Framboos, the Arthur & Tommy blend and some vintage magnums I didnt know they existed we were able to taste the pre-release golden blend ... and man was this an amazing geuze! This one can certainly compare to the A4 Lente. The smell is alot barnyard, old lambic. A nice head which doesnt dissapear.The 4 year old lambic is defenately amazing, great wood taste, what superb complexity this blend has.This is again a great creation of Arma/nd, he did it again!
Had this again at home, and I need to re-rate this to 18/20, by far one of the best geuzes Ive already tasted.","BELGIUM","tquest"
