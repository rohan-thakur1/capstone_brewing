928,"2017-06-15",2.9,"Ive crossed paths with Anchor Steam many many times in my beer drinking career yet never imbibed it. In my experience it is often considered a good beer by people of dubious tastes, so I was never inspired to drink it. When a few bottles ended up in my fridge, I thought I should finally give it a fair chance. It pours a clear copper hue with a lovely, frothy head. So far so good. The smell is refreshing, mineral, yet somewhat cheap. Ocean breeze, fresh oysters  am I being influenced by the label, the San Francisco name? It does take me back to walking down the Embarcadero on a sunny day, breathing in the fresh Pacific air. Mild malts and hops appear on the nose, but feel watered down. Citrusy, slightly grassy notes, not offensive. On the palate its again quite mineral, a very watery flavor. Cheap malts are the main attraction, with a lightly roasted coffee flavor, and a twist of piney hops. Unlike its hometown, theres not a whole lot to see. The finish is mildly bitter with subtle chocolatey flavors and cranberry. Leaves a slightly funky flavor in the mouth, which, on the bright side, makes you want to wash it down with some of that early minerality. Overall, this is a bland brew. Simple but not in a good way. If Im at a regular bar in the US, Ill take a Blue Moon over this any day. I was hoping to be surprised, but unfortunately, Anchor Steam lived up to my very low expectations.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Occasion: 1001 and BL sampler. - Bref: ESB, simplified Franconian Keller and Kölsch meet their hybrid equal in this robust golden sessioner that started it all. Evergreen and classic. - Love the deep bronze, copper hue. Crisp aroma of caramelised barley and whisky malts, ears of barley swaying under a high sun - no real hop aroma, the fruitiness (apricot, wood, unripe banana) seems mostly malt derived. - Pleasant caramel cracker dry mouthfeel, love the natural carbonation here between ungespundet, real ale and old champagne. Nuances of toast in the flavour that keep me going in for another gulp. The bitter Northern Brewer bite is in the tail: fresh hop flowers, crisp caramels pinching the taste buds with a hint of astringent barley husk, dried grasses and nettle, hay, peels of dried fruit, walnuts.

Nazwa ""Steam Beer"" jest nazwą prawnie zastrzeżoną przez browar.
Nazwa wywodzi się stąd, że w dawnych czasach piwo w tym stylu było fermentowane w dużych, płytkich i otwartych kadziach, aby zrekompensować brak chłodzenia i wykorzystać chłodne temperatury regionu San Francisco.
Burzliwe zachowanie piwa w procesie fermentacji wywoływało wrażenie parowania. Staąd też powstała nazwa ""Steam Beer"".

Samo piwo łączy w sobie cechy Lagera dolnej fermentacji z piwami Ale górnej fermentacji.
Jest niezłą odskocznią od wszystkich piw warzonych przy użyciu nowofalowych, amerykańskich chmieli.

Piwo jest lekko owocowe, wyraźniej słodowe z karmelem i cechami charakterystycznymi dla chmielu Northern Brewer (mięta, drewno, wiejska nuta).
Piwo bardzo pijalne, smaczne i wręcz sesyjne.

The body is surprisingly light with medium carbonation. This is an interesting combination given that a malt dominated aroma generally goes along with a thicker body. Caramel and grapes are getting even stronger in the mouth and fruity notes are more dominant. There is a straightness that I didnt expect that it makes is refreshing and easy drinking but still keeps up a nice aroma profile. Leaves a light bitter a fruity aftertaste.","GERMANY","bartholos"

928,"2015-11-16",4.1,"4.9%ABV.  California Common.

Poured out of the bottle a deep amber.  18ºSRM.  Maybe for sentimental reasons, this appears to be the amber hue that is most associated with good times?!

Nose has some clean sweet aromas hinting at wheatiness.  Beery and very slightly yeasty.  There are plenty of sweet malty aromas  suggesting nicely browning toast, not unlike the slightly sweet, wet aroma that you get from freshly toasted seven grain or wheat bread.  There are nutty, brown-roasted flavors as well.

Mouthfeel is carbonated and soapy.  Medium weight.   Very pleasing palate of nutty, caramel type malty flavors.  There are also wheaty flavors of white bread, dough, and raw peanuts.  There is also a beery fruitiness right in the middle of the palate. 

Finish is lightly bitter, clean and overall still malt-balanced. 

A good clean old timey favorite revived at the very dawn of American craft brewing.

Pours brownish amber with a large, rocky, off-white head and lively carbonation. It laces very well for a bottled beer. The aroma is gassy and sweet, with caramel and vaguely medicinal notes.

928,"2015-02-11",3.6,"Ah the famous Anchor steam beer, by some metrics America's only truly indigenous-origin style beer. As described, it is indeed a crossover between a lager and an ale. Pours a very nice clear amber orange color, with a large creamy head and plenty of lacing, very lager-ish. The nose is brown sugar caramel malt and some grassy hops, moderate intensity. The taste is very intriguing and flavorful, caramel maltiness balanced with an earthy/grassy bitterness, almost a caramel malt-accented pilsner. Bonus is the tropical fruity finish, which is more reminiscent of an ale, combined with a slick earthy bitterness. Very delicious, but in my experience this seemed to be excessively carbonated which detracted from the texture and distracted from the flavor.

928,"2014-10-10",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2015 Una birra nata dalla grande tradizione americana e da un famosissima birrificio sulla west coast che però non riesce a stupire. Una birra lineare caratterizzata dalla importante maltazione che dona aromi caramellati e leggermente tostati orfani però di una adeguata luppolatura. Risulta una birra piuttosto squilibrata e tendente al dolce difficilmente soppotabile per una intera pinta.

928,"2014-10-01",3.5,"Appearance: Pours a clear bronze amber colour with minimal sudsy head.

Overall: This isnt a showcase beer. Its not going to blow your mind. This beer does a few things well but it only does a few things. Its well-made and well-balanced and I think most people would drink it and enjoy it. I would definitely have it again and recommend it to others.

928,"2014-09-26",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 10-10-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a nice amber-copper color with a big billowy just off white head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, very slowly fading over about a 5-10 min time period to leave a light level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is mainly a mix of some more grainy smells mixed with a caramel sweetness. Along with these aromas there are some lighter hop smells of an earthy nature and a bit of grass.

 Taste  The taste begins with a dry bready and grainy flavor with a bit of an earthy taste. There is a light caramel sweetness throughout the taste that is most intense at the beginning (although still very light) which almost disappears toward the end of the taste. While the taste has a hop bit at the start with the earthy tastes, more hop of a grassy and light citrus nature come to the tongue bittering the taste as it moves on. Some woody flavors come to the tongue more toward the end of the taste, with the combination of flavors leaving a rather dry, malty and decently bitter flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average to just above average. Both the moderate body and carbonation are rather good for the mix of dry and bitter flavors, making it a good easier drinking brew.

 Overall  A nice dry tasting steam beer that is very easy to drink. A good go too for something on the lighter side.","","Darkmagus82"

928,"2014-07-05",3.4,"12 oz. bottle poured to a Czech-pils glass at Lunar Brewing Co., displaying a clear & bright, orangey gold color, with a frothy/cakey layer of fairly persistent, white head foam, and waves & spots of lacing. The nose was light grain, light yeast, lightly toasted & sweetened malt, and a subtle fruit scent. Light to medium bodied, with fairly lively carbonation, the taste incorporated the aroma notes, and added a moderate, earthy bitterness that lingered with some dryness to form a pleasantly crisp finish. A quite sessionable, benchmark brew that Ive enjoyed many times, and presupposed that I had reviewed.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

OCZY : piwo jest dosyć przejrzyste i ma kolor bursztynowy. Piana jest mała o kolorze białym. Świetny lacing. 

NOS : piwo ma aromat karmelu, tosta, gruszki, banana, lodów malaga, drewna, kukurydzy. Delikatnie przypomina zapach whisky. 

USTA : średnio gazowane o konsystencji trochę bardziej gęstej od wody. Puszyste i aksamitne w ustach. 
Słodowe nuty są umiarkowanie słodkie. Przypominają lekko palony karmel i złocisty tost. Piwo delikatnie kwaśnieje na styl goździków i śmietany. Gorycz jest delikatna, zdominowana przez cierpkość podobną do goździków i kwasku cytrynowego. 

ODCZUCIA ; piwo jest świetnie skomponowane i pomimo, że kwaśnieje to po każdym następnym łyku nuty słodowe to niwelują. Piwo łatwe w piciu o ciekawych estrach. Na dłuższą metę może znudzić. Brakuje trwałości w smaku, szczególnie w ciekawych nutach słodowych.

928,"2013-12-03",3.8,"Ive been drinking Anchor Steam Beer for awhile as my ""what is that beer?"" of choice, i.e. the ones that get my friends talking when I pull it out.

Upon pouring, it has a nice Amber colour with a decent head. There is not a lot of carbonation bubbles but it still has some kick when drinking it. It smells quite crisp and has a little bitterness to it. You can taste some of the hops, but it is not overpowering. There is a bit of an aftertaste but nothing bad. You can feel the beer on the front and back of the mouth.

I would suggest this as a nice beer to try if you want some hops but dont want to go all crazy with an American IPA.","Alberta, CANADA","JeanDuteau"

Kobber-farvet og klar amerikansk ale med fint småboblende offwhite-farvet skum, 1 cm tykt.
Dejlig sødlig og frisk duft af abrikos og vådt hø. 
Velafstemt smag af sødme og bitterhed med sidstnævnte som dominerende. Smagen starter frisk henad bayersk pilsner, hvorefter den humlede (?) bitterhed kommer snigende. 
Mundfølelsen er middel rund med kulsyreindhold lige under middel. 
Øllet har en sødme henad en Bock, men man efterlades med smagsindtrykket af en Classic. God velsmagende øl i pilsnerklassen!

The light, earthy aroma is pleasing, but it is too mild to be very enticing. 

The flavor starts with a good hit of earthy/spicy hops, with the malt component becoming more apparent mid-taste. The hops are present all the way through, making this steam beer seeming to build in intensity through the finish. Great hops/malt balance leaves both bitter/sweet and other flavor components in exemplary balance. Excellent roster of malts.

Very pretty beer. Nose is simple. A touch of sour yeast, some caramel malt and a bit of fruit. Malt is a touch toasted and grainy. First taste is some light citrus that washes over the palate like a gushing stream, then some hop bitter settles in on the mid palate. The malt is smooth toasted grain. Theres a light sweetness and lager yeast. The malt is woody and earthy. The body of the beer is medium/ light and smooth. To look at it you would think its very sweet but it isnt. It drinks so easily that you never notice how fat the malt is. Finish is dry and grainy. 

This beer has a classic and clean taste that is enjoyable to say the least. The hops are soft yet bitter and drinks like a lazy afternoon. Friendly and approachable.

Anchor Steam is a beer that Ive wanted to try for awhile now, but just now decided to finally order one and get my first taste. I had never had a beer of this style before, so I was actually surprised. With the ABV and the name ""Steam"" beer I was expecting a light beer that was light on flavor and pretty much a slightly better version of an adjunct lager... its better than that. The smell is of malts with a fair amount of hops. The taste has mild hops on the front, with a malty and bitter finish. I was not expecting this beer to taste the way that it did, but I enjoyed it. I had Black Crown by Budweiser just last week, and honestly, this tastes like a craft version of that beer. It has a similar malt aftertaste with a trace of wood, but with a bit less sweetness and more bitterness. Clearly, this beer is MUCH better than Black Crown will ever be, but thats a beer a lot of people are familiar with that I would compare this one to.

Would not exactly be my beer of choice (Theres nothing offensive about it at all and its a solid, craft beer), but its a very respectable beer with a lot of history behind it.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

Comments: my first time tasting of this genre and I quite like it. It combine the best of two styles - good aroma of English ale with strong German Pils hoppiness.

Surprisingly i?m not getting much hop smell from it.taste: It has a grainy dark honey sugary base flavor with some bittering hops through it to balance it out, its a bit like rye. The hops mellow out during the finish, leaving the lovely sweet malts and nectar like texture. mouthfeel:  Nectar like velvet. Syrupy. Very smooth and round. With some medium carbonation to freshen it up. Only the finish turns a bit bitter in a not great way after a while in the mouth. Its the dry rye like flavor that lingers. It?s quite sugary in texture, yet the hops gives it a nice light bitter kick.","NETHERLANDS","Xstream"

928,"2013-02-11",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2017 drank at home ( according to the bottle, this is 4,8 ABV , not 4,9 ) but its the same beer. 
such a funny looking ( feeling ) bottle ! 
pours clear, orange , white head with big bubbles. fades very fast . malty smell
taste is rich, high carbo, malts, sweetness ( from the malts i supose) . its ok, if someone told me this was another blonde abbey beer of belgium, id believe them straight away . so is this realy a diffrent style ( its my first CC ) ? its good, nevertheless. but not more than that.

Re-rate ( same score ) from a blind tasting with Dr. Beer. Served in black glassware. Smell is mostly breaddough maltyness. Mild fruityness, bit creamy. 
Taste is rather bitter, bit fruityness from the hops, but not intensely so. Mild sweetness, from the malts ( breaddough, pale malts ) Bit creamy. Assertive carbonation, but a decent body to support it. 
--- Note --- clearly I have learned a bit more about styles than when I first rated it. I still havent had many CCs ( this one, is perhaps one of the only one? ) But i did have a shitload of Belgian blondes, which I dont think are to be confused with this beer anymore...","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

I get more of this on tasting as well as sweet almost caramel malt that dominates.  Very reminiscent of some dopplebocks Ive had as well as having a nutty quality similar to something like New Castle Brown Ale.  Light bitter hop finish that is somewhat spicy.  I know this style is based on the lager, but I dont get many tasting notes I usually associate with lagers.  This could be due to having mostly tried European Pilsners.  Still, if more American Lagers had this kind drink-ability and flavor Id be more inclined to drink them more often.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","albinotron"

928,"2013-01-03",3.0,"December 16th, 2011 - Rating and reviewing Anchors Steam Beer nearly four years after I took up the craft beer hobby feels like a transgression against the whole of the field. I spent the last years chasing after glitzy new bottles and beers from far-flung places, when there was a seminal and classic cornerstone of brewing sitting on the shelves all this time. This is a drinkable institution, and I hang my head in shame that it took me so long to buy a six-pack. Once poured, this beer takes on a deep golden hue with a normal carbonation and a small off-white head. Caramel drips and dribbles in the aroma, off-set by a pilsner malt mineral quality, and the sweetness of deep, slightly heated glob of honey. A sip introduces a slight sweetness, but its gone before I can really get a taste of it. Where it drops off a blander maltiness appears. Its not as light or thin as a pale lager, in that the Anchor Steam tastes cleaner, with more of a mineral water flavor, and a neutral graininess, but no appreciable depth or complexity. Clean, uniform, crisp and somewhat austere, this might be the Scandinavian design of beers - classic in its style, and no doubt a master stroke in brewing despite the spartan flavors. However, I think Im addicted to deeper, darker stuff. Still, thats no reason not to look back and drink parts of craft brew history here and there.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

928,"2012-04-09",3.5,"A: Pours a murky copper color, with a large, sexy four-finger off-white head that fades away at a moderate pace.

S: Mostly earthy aromatic hops, but also features a small bready scent, as well.

T: The opening is malty, biscuity, and almost sweet, while it finishes with a decent hit of grassy, floral hops. Flavorful and refreshing, but I imagine it would be better suited to the summer months.

M: Finishes very wet, and has moderately high carbonation overall. Nice smoothness, too.

O: This is pretty damn good, and like many of the well-known craft beers (SN Pale Ale, SA Boston Lager), has a good degree of versatility, as well. On the other hand, its not my favorite, and truth be told, I think I prefer Flying Dog Old Scratch (if were staying in the not-too-well represented style of the California Common) overall.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

928,"2012-03-01",3.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/18/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Anchor Steam pours a dark orange color, cloudy with large bubbles clinging to the bottom of the glass before their inevitable ascent to maintain the head on top. Although a modest foamy white head is initially visible, it fades to a film with a pronounced ring. 

Light toasted malt and long-lasting earthy hops create a relatively light aroma.

A bit of caramel sneaks through, but the flavor here is mostly a modest level bitterness, with just a dash of tart lemon. The malt back is reminiscent of a toasted biscuit, but the earthy hop flavors step in front. The finish stays bitter.

This is briskly carbonated, as was apparent from the appearance. Slightly dry, more so at the finish. Grainy and slightly astringent with a light to medium body.

This is definitely a beer worth trying. It is Anchors flagship beer and has by far the most reviews of any Steam beer. There is a fair amount going on here, especially for an American Lager at 4.9%.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Strong hop aroma with some nice herbal notes & a little spiciness too. The later part is similar but with more of a citrus & pine presence. Well balanced.

An orange amber colour that is slightly darker in places & settles with a thin white, bubbly head with average retention.

A lot a pine in the flavour that is blended together nicely with some good citrus flavours & just a hint of sweetness. Along with the initial bitter hops their is a background herbal & grassy hops taste & a semi bitter, hop infused semi-bitter one.

Very smooth to drink & highly drinkable as a direct result of this. The beer is a medium bodied one & the carbonation is about right for the type of beer.

Overall this one was great with a beautiful bitter hop flavour that was very well balanced & went down great. I imagine this would make an excellent session beer.

Theres also a bit of a funky off-flavor that I cant really put my finger on. Taste is generally very balanced between malty sweet and hoppy bitterness but a bit too smooth and lacking enough of a finish. Body is very light, which doesnt help the generally lightweight feel of the beer compared to other US craft beer.

928,"2011-05-15",3.9,"12 ounce stubby bottle poured into a 10 ounce glass.  Its been years - perhaps a decade even - since I last had the famous Anchor Steam Beer.  Pouring it again, for the first time, and Im struck by the loads upon loads of carbonation in the brew.  The bubbles just go on for days.  Upon further inspection, this beer is brilliantly clear, as you can easily read the label from behind the glass.  A big frothy head bursts to the top of the brew, but recedes just as quickly.  Color is darker than gold but not quite amber, settling in at a rusty orange.  Smells of a light grain, almost like a pilsner.  First taste is sweet, almost fruity, with a very sweet malt finish.  This - this is not like I remember at all!  Moderate bitterness in the finish, but not overpowering at all.  Slightly sticky and relatively thick mouth feel, though the heavy carbonation helps to scrub the taste off your tongue as you drink it.  As you continue to taste the malt becomes more and more pronounced, and it works in context with the yeast profile to create almost a jam and bread flavor.

Taste:  I got big sugar throughout this beer.  Tastes like it has a bunch of left over unfermented sugars.  Maybe thats the style?  After the apple sugar I got a slightly tart, mildly skunky finish.  Also on the finish was a hop note similar to lime citrus.  Very mildly bitter.
Palate:  Flabby.  Not overly effervescent or luxurious just sugary full.

The aroma is almost entirely malty: sweet, with caramel; it resembles a belgian double. There is also a hint of yeast, and almost no hops presence. It tastes likewise, very very malty, with a good deal of sweetness. Low on bitterness, it is softly carbonated, full-bodied and finishes dry, leaving a pleasant sweet malty aftertaste with some herbal hops. A good crafted beer.

928,"2011-02-13",3.6,"I can tell you one thing about this beer: it has a really active and busy head.  Kind of an off-white color, but incredibly frothy.  An amazing head.  This is so airy, probably the most airy head I have ever seen in my life.  I think I see why call this ""steam beer"".  Body looks thin, a clear, glowing orange-amber color.  Not alot of carbonation in the glass for all the head.  Aroma is of a decent, malty lager with earthy, almost woody undertones.  The frothy head makes drinking (or smelling) this quite interesting.  Flavor is great!  Nothing like a lager, really... well, sort of.  It almost has the mouth feel of a lager, but its thicker, more malty, and less bitter.  Incredibly smooth and tasty.  Although its on the thicker end of the lager spectrum, it still has a very thin experience and is really sessionable and easy to drink.  A hint of sweetness, light caramel.

The taste is similar to the aroma consisting mostly of malted barley with the hops taking a stronger presence in comparison. The taste is a little sweet with the fruit notes and a bit of nuttiness coming through. A very enjoyable flavor that is not too heavy. This could easily be a session beer.

928,"2010-01-23",3.7,"If youve been following my beer reviews for a while you know Ive attempted to coin phrases and adages when it comes to beer-critiquing. Another one Id like to start is, ""Just because its a novelty or unique beer or has a reputation doesnt necessarily mean its outstanding.""

To back up that claim Id point to Anchor Steam Beer. This is a beer known for its unique brewing process which is a bit difficult to describe. Its a long, but fascinating story and Id recommend looking up its history. Its also important to note that the brewery has trademarked the title ""steam beer"" and all others brewed in style must be referred to as ""California Common."" As for the beer itself, Id definitely have to say its good, but considering just how well known it is for its original style I was expecting something world class. However, Ill settle for a solid performer any day.

APPEARANCE AND AROMA

Ive never been a fan of inverted funnel-shaped bottles like Anchor Steam uses. However, I was surprised it produced such a smooth pour with almost no kickback. The body is a clear shade of amber bordering on bright orange. Its mostly clear but a tiny bit hazy. Not surprisingly, there is plenty of carbonation noticeable which lasts throughout the life of the beer (this condition is partly responsible for the beer garnering the ""steam"" nickname).

The head is a thick, two-finger layer of off-white foam which outlasts the liquid and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is surprisingly mild with a mostly generic, slightly grainy scent. I also noticed a sweetness to the nose, but it was faint as well.

TASTE

I didnt know what to expect from Anchor Steam Beer. I knew it had a reputation for being uniquely brewed and I assumed its taste was just as unique. After my first swig I found myself befuddled at how familiar the palate actually seemed.

The best way to describe the taste would be something similar to an authentic niche German lager like a Vienna or Marzen. There is a slight caramel sweetness to the palate, but at the same time a noticeable dry texture. Its followed by a fairly crisp palate not unlike most American lagers, but without the intense taste of grain or adjuncts. Overall, the taste is sweet but mild. I didnt notice much hop bite or bitterness, but I did enjoy the sweet, malty flavors.

DRINKABILITY

I would consider Anchor Steam to be a little above average when it comes to its drinkability. The mouthfeel is a little thin and watery but the crispness also makes its presence known. It finishes smooth, but not entirely. Considering its mostly sweet and fairly mild palate Id certainly label it drinker-friendly.

WEIGHT

Weighing in at 4.9% ABV, this is a rather light to average beer as far as density. It didnt seem all that heavy in the drinking process, nor did it fill me up quickly or thoroughly afterwards. I think it lends itself to meal-pairing or sessioning but probably wouldnt work as a party beverage.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Im always happy to try beers known for any unusual or original qualities they may have. In the case of Anchor Steam Beer Im genuinely glad I tried it and would say that I liked it, but I was expecting something a little more impressive. But at the end of the day its still a good beer and thats what matters, right?

This beer starts off looking great.  A deep amber color with a  pillowy off-white head of foam sitting on top.  The head has no problem maintaining itself.  The nose tells me some effort went into making this brew.  Perhaps some noble hops are at work here.  A little grassy with notes of hay and some toasted malt.  The flavor is quite refreshing with a great malt and hop balance.  The taste follows the nose, particularly on the grassy side.  The mouthfeel is on the medium side, but very crisp.  The finish is bitter, but it doesnt linger on the tongue too long.  Overall this is a well made and highly sessionable brew.  Perfect for just about anytime, but very rewarding after a day of hard labor.  Drink up!","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Floral notes dominate the taste at first, something very un-lager-like. Theres aniseed, too, some light malt, a resinous note - with herbal, dry hops in the middle and finish. After taste is bitter, but very moderately so.

Unusual mix of flavours of blond and darker beers. Bitterness makes it very refreshing, though there is indeed a somewhat metallic note in the after taste as you keep drinking. To avoid it, youll have to keep the time between individual sips short - which is fine by me. ;=)

928,"2009-05-09",3.1,"She shines like polished copper in the clear California skies, glinting and sparkling with flashes of amber and orange playing tricks with my eyes. A puffy white head floats lazily atop her crown as if a cloud had fallen from the sky to perch quite happily there. Like a gentle summer breeze, her nose embraces me with fresh lemon and sweet honey warmed by the sun. Fresh dough, cereal grains, and malt keep her full-bodied and strong while maple, cinnamon, and summer fruits such as peaches and melons liven things up a bit. As tantalizing as her nose is, tis her brew that I savor the most and my first quaff is bright lemon juice and savory peaches and melon drenched in honey. A faint presence of bitter grapefruit and dry grass lingers in the back of her palate while a frothy mouthfeel makes way for a bready fullness of warm white bread and cereal grains. A growing bitter presence in her finish does not detract from her overall palate of peach skins, melon, and honey. Instead, their balance is perfect, and each refreshing quaff leads easily into the next until there is nothing left to savor but our treasured memories.


I could drink Anchor Steam any day, every day. It is easy to see how the thirsty hunters of gold quenched their hopes and dreams with this golden elixir that sparkled in the light of hope and promise.

Malty, sweet taste that gives way to a well balanced and appetizing hop bitterness and an alcoholic pepperiness, with a long and warming finish.  Trademarking ""steam beer"" seems a bit selfish and oportunistic, especially considering no one really knows how ""steam beer"" was originally made.  None the less, this commercially successful brew, for good and bad reasons, remains a historically important brew and well deserves its place among the best american ales.

928,"2008-02-17",3.0,"On tap at Teds Montana Grill. Poured a nice, deep, bright red with a medium-sized off-white (light tan) head. The aroma is full of malts - particularly bready and toasty. The flavor is also malty - lots of bready and toasty flavors. There is a subtle touch of caramel malts, but not much - the residual sweetness is pretty low. The flavor is quite clean - which is a little surprising given that this ""hybrid"" lager is supposed to be distinguished from other lagers by a touch of fruity esters. By mid-palate, the balancing bitterness of hops grows. This beer is supposed to be characterized by Northern Brewer hops - but the hopping level is lower than I expected, so I couldnt really pick out any particular variety (except that I already know its Northern Brewer). The finish is somewhat dry and bitter. The mouthfeel is medium-full in body and the carbonation is low (its probably much more effervescent in a bottle than the draft I had). Overall, a clean, easy-to-drink lager that is more full-flavored than other mass-produced lagers, but still bland compared to other full-flavored beers (especially bland next to Anchors other products, which are for the most part fantastic).","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

In general, this is a decent beer and quite drinkable and sessionable.

A little thin on the palate, but flavorful nonetheless.  Rich maltiness is quickly upstaged by bitterness, but the whole affair is rather milder than is typical of many west coast brews.  A little of the Bass Ale type flavor is going on, and the clean finish with a hint of astringency reminds me a little of that British brew as well.  A very easy drinking beer with some flavor.  Might be a good gateway beer to get from macrobrew lager swill to the good stuff.","","User57106"

928,"2007-09-07",3.5,"The head quickly faded away. I attempted to do well on the pour, but I couldnt get it to stay. The beer has a nice caramel color to it. I also cannot say how much I enjoy the unique style of the bottle. Very fruity aroma! The fermenting process, with the lager yeasts at ales temperatures, must have produced some unique fruit flavors. I really dont smell the aroma hops at all. I am trying to pick them out with my nose, but the fruit smell just dominates. The malts are coming out as well. Having a hard time picking the malts out over the fruit smell. The flavor hop is nice and crisp, and the bittering hop is very mild. The malts are noticeable in the taste, but in my opinion not much more noticeable in the taste than in the smell. The malts get extremely noticeable as the beer warms. I believe they are crystal malts for the beer which gives it this great color. I am starting to pick up on a nutty taste, which is great. I like to complexity of the beer, and enjoy it very much. Very carbonated, and somewhat smooth. Love this Anchor Steam.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Taste was upfront moderate bitter grass and cobwebs with light sweet and slightly sour raisin fruit followed by a strong bitter grass hops with light sweet gelatin on a long finish.  Palate was light to medium bodied, dry, softly carbonated and moderately astringent.

The flavor is solid as well.  Big creamy caramel malt with much more liberal floral hops that I could detect in the nose.

Taste: I have never had a steam beer before and I enjoyed this. The flavor was not complex or amazing but i was extremely drinkable. I was eating a Kilbassa and this was a perfect accompaniment. It had the nice sweet amber attribute to it. The sweet malts. but then it had a bit of hops. Gentle, laid back hops but enough to keep it interesting. I think there was a certain amount of smokiness to the beer as well. There were no fire works with this beer is was simple and drinkable. mmm.

928,"2006-08-11",3.1,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2013 Dette er tredje genvurdering af øllen, da mine to første smagninger er landet noget under gennemsnittet. Denne gang blev karakteren noget højere, men jeg er dog stadig ikke synderligt imponeret over øllen. 

Duften er rimeligt anonym; kun lidt karamel og en smule humle og alkohol. Der er ikke noget at sætte en finger på, men heller ej noget at juble over. 

Smagen er let karamelagtig med den føromtalte smule humle i form af en vedvarende bitterhed hele øllen igennem. Der er en smule alkohol i slutningen, ligesom bitterheden fortsætter et stykke tid. Måske kan der anes en smule blomsterhumle, men det er ikke meget. Igen er der ikke noget at sætte en finger på, men heller ikke noget ekstraordinært. 

Tyngden af øllen er ret god for en lys og letmaltet øl på 4,9 %.

928,"2006-02-16",3.2,"Fritz Maytags classic revivalist beer, the so-called Steam beer due to its unique, warm, bottom fermentation and complex brewing process. Certainly has a hybrid quality to it, easy to drink like a pale lager with the fruity flavour characteristics of a light ale. Pours a tawny copper, quite clear with a dense, rocky beige head that was mostly lasting, leaving behind a fine trail of lace. Fruits on the nose- not overly fresh, more like a concentrate- with a lightly nutty burst of toffee, caramel and toasted grains. First sip was quite parching whilst the second sip showed the character that would follow it through until the end. Vanilla and toffee come in early as a lightly sweet start to a beer that dries out  across the rest of the palate. Light grainy note precedes spicy, citric fruits in the back  that give a lightly bitter end before a drying fruity swallow. Quite soft in carbonation and a little thin in mouthfeel. Something in this just seems to dry the mouth right out. Its not overly generous in the flavour department, crossing the tongue with the cleanness of a good lager and the finish is a little too short for my liking. Overall, though, its interesting enough and is one that I could easily down in quick succession. Nice, but not extraordinary.

Its a nice amber colour with orange highlights and a fine, loose head showing good retention. The aroma is not at all what I expected. Rather than floral hops, the first thing that struck me was a sticky toffee note reminiscent of Thomas Hardy Ale. A few swirls released some pine, honey and a Belgian-style yeastiness. Medium bodied and very softly carbonated. A very balanced beer, not too aggressive with its flavours. Toffee notes initially, a bready middle and a long, lingering spicy finish.

Pours a clear amber orange with an offwhite head. This one takes me back to graduate school, drinking too many bottles at too rapid a pace in some rented Palo Alto apartment.

928,"2006-01-25",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2006  Steam beer is a beer style that originated on the West Coast of the United States. Before the days of refrigeration, West Coast brewers brewed beer with a lager yeast, but had to work with temperatures more suited for ales. So to cool the brew it was fermented in abnormally shallow vessels, but conditioned at warmer ale temperatures. This vessels were found of the roof of the brewery, so when the fermenting beer hit the cool ocean breezes of San Francisco, steam could be see coming from the roof of the brewery. It is also said that  so  much natural carbonation would build up when the beer conditioned in wooden kegs that the beer woul ""steam"" when tapped. So what is steam beer? It is a hybrid beer, somewhere between an ale and a lager, taking the best of both worlds. It has the fruity esters of an ale, yet the smoothness of a lager. Anchor Steam is a world class beer, and the classic example of this unique style. 

Anchor Steam pours to a beautiful, bright, amber color, with a thick white head, and a very lively carbonation. The nose is wonderful. Aromas of hops, malt, and fruity esters flood the nose. The palate is firm, some good pale malt and sweet malt flavors, and touches of fruity esters coat the tongue. The body is very round and smooth, making Anchor Steam a very drinkable beer. This beer finishes with more esters up front, and then dries with a pleasing hop bitterness that slightly lingers. 

This beer is exceptional. It would match well with a number of dishes. I find it to work extremely well with shellfish such as mussels, clams, crabs, or lobsters. It would also work well with grilled fish, or with a nice grilled rib eye or NY strip steak. Or just a great beer to drink after a long day.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Aroma is softly clean and grainy with a slight toastyness; creamy, earthy tones keep underneath with a great fresh breadiness displayed on the nose the whole time.

Great fresh flavors, lightly malty with a nudging sweetness always peeking through with what tends to be an always present, fine bready toastyness. Creamy and lightly earthy with a tender texture and easy going malt base. The grain flavors are nicely handled with an eager mildness that lasts a long time. Finishes earthy with a slight grassy edged hoppyness floating along the end of the bready stuff. A great Steam beer by the innovators of the style, Anchor.

As with everything Anchor does it is perfect, but this style and that kind of hop profile does not intrigue me.  This is a good beer to have in your fridge to give to someone who does not get good beer yet.  I am not saying it is an intro style or has little or no flavor.

Looks lovely: clear dark amber (bordering on copper) with a light film but no head. Should mention that Im sampling in San Fran Holiday Inn where the glassware is minimal. Taste: a gush of light roasty malt then a gentle bitterness in good balance but - is that it?!? Aftertaste is mild sustained bitterness with a dusky kinda natural malt edge. The body is where this beer interests me: super smooth with ultrafine effervesence around tongue tip. Verrrrrry drinkable (though more of that carb-feel would be nice) - a good session beer.

Unusual and decidedly sweet aroma and taste -- I agree with a previous reviewer who detected ""banana"" in it, although Id perhaps call it ""candied banana.""

Mostly musky with maybe a slight touch of apple, though certainly not offensive. A bit wattery in the mouth, although the beer really shines through in a pleasant, very slightly malty flavor that is nice and easily drinkable (though not ""smooth"" like a stout). Maybe its influenced by the name but I feel like I can taste steamyness (even though its not actually made with any sort of steam). It just gives off that kind of feeling.

How many times have I been rescued by this ale being the only palatable thing on tap a ""good"" restaurant? Steam performs in the hop category. It has a civil gravity and is just pretty to pour.

This aroma foreshadowed a fairly predictable, but delicious flavor dominated by a somewhat spicy, crisp hoppiness.  Also present was a pleasing amount of mild sweetness and a moderately bitter finish.  Mouthfeel was dissapointingly thin, but not unpleasant.

Aroma: soft and clean, with hints of fruit, bread, cream, nuts.
On the palate: smooth and fruity, with a small hop contingent, and very, very tasty. Body is light/ medium, texture is good, finish is long and friendly!
The fruity flavor stays on the palate for the greatest portion of this drink, and continues to reward it's consumption. With every sip, the flavor jumps aboard with zeal and vigor, fresh and ready for the task (of refreshment!). Tasty, and tangy, and, again, very giving.

RERATE: 3/21/2010 - had this again for the first time in a little while as part of a BJCP training session - my usual complaint about Anchor Steam - if this is supposed to be a ""showcase"" for the Northern Brewer hop, why are the woodsy and minty notes so muted?  The hops are there, but just not that up front.  Still mildly annoyed with Anchor for trademarking ""steam.""  Score remains the same.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Upon opening the bottle I was excited when I took in the sweet aroma and the deep caramel appearance which reminded me of Yuengling Lager.  The head looks dark & frothy.  The flavor was strong but bitter and an aftertaste that reminded me of Schlitz which we used to buy when we just wanted to drink cheap in the 70s.

Not much head after it got to my table, but it was very bubbly to the tongue.  Really pretty shade of amber/copper.  Aroma almost non-existant.  Kinda sweet smelling like Kool-Aid.  Taste is very good, definate caramel touches.  Reminded me a lot of Bass.  I'd like to try those two side by side.  A little watery overall; was expecting something with more body.","Port Allen, Louisiana, USA","ppcpilot"

928,"2003-08-27",3.2,"Popped the cap - this one was a gusher.  This beer pours a nice rich amber, with a white head.  Light aroma, a little bready, with some nice melon and coffee notes.  Flavour is also light, but a little bitter; nothing is especially pronounced.  Palate is very smooth, but the body is very highly carbonated (due to the addition of extra yeast, before it's bottled).","Ft. Worth, Texas, USA","adwoan99"
928,"2003-08-23",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2010 Superbly balanced, clean and drinkable with a fine, lingering bitterness that pulls me back for another sip --the archetype and pinnacle of the style.

Pale copper hue, clear; creamy, white head. Light honey and chunky, bready malts set against woodsy and herbal aromatics. Off-dry, moderate and clean acidity, mild bitterness; ends with a crisp, effervescent bite. Medium-light body, slick texture, mousse-like carbonation.

Old rating: 12 oz bottle, beer mug, 50 degrees.  Giant, white, foamy head seems to be well lasting and is accompanied by an average density, deep amber colored body with average carbonation.  Slightly piney, slightly citric hops and caramel, grainy malts play well together.  Aroma is lighter than I would like.  Moderately sweet, lightly bitter flavor becomes a lightly sweet, moderately bitter finish.  Aroma was very indicative of what the flavor would be like; although, theres a slight English pale ale warmth to the flavor that I didnt pick up in the aroma.  Medium bodied, watery texture, lively carbonation.  I could stand for the body to be a little fuller with a creamier texture.  The bottom line is: this is a great everyday beer, an absolute classic.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

928,"2003-08-12",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2006 This beer has an enticing copper color and pours with a light beige head.  There is not a huge amount of aroma to it, it smells clean, malty and a bit of floral grassiness to it.  A light sweet/ malty taste up front that finishes with a good bitterness.  This beer is about perfect balance between the hop and the malt.  Just a wonderful beer that, because of its popularity/ availability, of the gets short shrift.  In my mind this is one of the great everyday drinking beers.

The head was very mild...1/8 inch at most and more frothy than anything, it really had no effect on this steam beer. The Steam Beer poured a very plain orange...its strange and hard to describe..it literally was just orange, even with the light exposing those pulsating carbonated bubbles. The taste was something i could have done without though...very mild malt, a ton of carbonation, and one hell of a bitter pounding for the ages on the tongue by these wicked hops...and not a pretty one may i add. It was like leather, and heineken and miller geunine draft collided into making this. Not pretty at all. It was highly acidic, way over carbonated, and the aftertaste far too strong to merit such a high rating as this.

To Jack the Lad with his Union Jack vest and can of Ersatzenbrau Lager Anchor Steam might seem dangerously like a Bitter. On the other hand, it might appear relatively tame to a real ale drinker weaned on Fullers ESB."" Michael Jackson (www.beerhunter.com). I love the story of the washing machine manufacturers son, Fritz Maytag, buying up the struggling brewery because he loved the beer so much. Even here in the UK Anchor Steam Beer is legendary, and its such a pleasure to discover that it actually tastes good! The unusual brewing method produces an unusual and - I thought - unique beer. Its interesting to note that there are other breweries in California producing this strange hybrid. Jacksons comments hit the problem right on the head - too fruity for a lager, too thin for an ale. But a Vienna or a Bock can produce the same confusions and no one complains. I found the intense raison fruit, and the delicate hop dance complex and satisfying enough to overcome any problems with the thin body.

Its a good beer, but that aftertaste...really too bitter for a lager.  Looking forward to trying the Porter after a long absence, though.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

928,"2000-10-26",3.5,"A hybrid ale/lager. Is actually a lager yeast fermented at the low end of ale temperature range. The carmel malt dominates the nose with some restrained hops.

Fritz always does a great job.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

to judge.  Mild tasting, with a moderate
hop presence.  It really does, in some ways,
have char's of both a lager and ale.
Thanks to the new hop guide, I can say that I don't like Northern Brewer hops as a finish/aromatic hop.  The hop aromatics and flavors in this beer present as a slightly woody and earthy/musty note that I don't find particularly agreeable.  Bitter finish is a bit strong for this light bodied beer.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
