Avery has kindly fulfilled that need, though I could use this in bottles. This beer is basically black. The aroma is like walking into a coffee shop with someone grinding the beans a few feet away. The coffee is so genuine I can get the complexity of the bean itself. Its earthy with minimal acidic bite, toasted nuts, Im guessing Latin American or Hawaiian coffee.

1958,"2011-03-04",3.3,"Appearance: Very dark brown, near black body with a thin sliver of beige head.

Smell: Roasty, bold coffee-toned nose, though the standard-issue Out of Bounds stout featured this, so its hard to find exactly where the roasted malts end and roasted coffee begins. Background hint of bitter chocolate.

Taste: Roasty, even cuttingly so from the start with a distinct flavor of black patent malt. A hint of unsweetened chocolate does little to cut through this initial sharpness. The added blind-roasted coffee easily finds a home with the blindingly roasty black malts. Earthy, not-particularly-pungent spiciness from the hops. Amply bitter throughout. Dry, lightly astringent finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Fairly smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: An improvement on the original stout. While its not exactly out of sight, its at least not as out of mind as the so-so Out of Bounds Stout.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
