69,"2014-02-05",3.6,"Draught at Armsby Abbey, Summer 2012, as GhoulschipQuite carbonated is the glowing orange body (deep, burnished copper-amber) and it sports a small, off-white head that sticks around a covering, leaving bits of lacing. Clarity is good.Musty basement notes, vegetables (rhubarb, celery) and touches of caramel and vanilla are all pretty well melded together, if you can believe that? Its got a sweet edge to it, with some very light brett notes that dont really have the full force of tartness that most ""brett beers"" have. Strange, indeed, but quite intriguing.Lightly slick, somewhat sticky palate, has a creamy, tight carbonation that gives this beer a bit more body than it, perhaps, wants, but the light oak tannins, brett acids and nuttiness from the pumpkin seeds all serve to keep it mostly dry on the finish, with some light alcohol warmth that seems well-placed. Reminds me more of something like Saison de Pipaix, than it does something like Allagash Interlude (couldnt really think of a good adjunct, wine-barrel-aged brett Belgian to use as an example). Plenty of basement flavors coming from who knows where. Again, maybe not the most objectively delightful beer, but highly interesting and certainly drinkable. An aged bottle would more than likely be divine.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

69,"2012-03-15",3.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/14/2011.  Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a stemmed tulip.

The beer itself is a murky tangerine orange color with a brown center. Splotches of head exist instead of a real head. 

Lemon zest, barnyard funk, dry pumpkin, and some fall spices compose the aroma.

It is sweet and sour up front but not overly sour, with lemon zest combining with the dry malt up front. Pumpkin, clove, and allspice contribute to a dry, pumpkin tartness that combines a bit of malt and lemon zest at the end. 

It starts medium bodied with a soft creamy sweetness, then slowly becomes more acetic, dries out and finishes with a lighter body. A bit of residue sits on the inside of my lips.

The aroma is right up my alley, funky Brett at a peak point for aroma with a light sweetness to help complement it. The flavor is the perfect balance of Brett yeast funk and sour with a bit of tart settling on the end","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
69,"2011-12-30",3.7,"Allagash ghoulschip. 375ml bottle courtesy of Wallace... Cork pops to a mild degree. Pours a hazy orangey brown hue and topped with a creamy white head... Sweet toasty caramel grains, yams with light oak.  
Pumpkin subtle in the background with a light tartness... Flavors are continuation of the same with a light oak tartness to start things off with a softer pumpkin and yam essence albeit very lightly induced overall. Soft pillowy body with a light level of carbonation.  Nicely executed and glad to have tried but somewhat underwhelmed as a whole.

69,"2011-12-25",3.5,"375ml, bottled in September 2011.  My bottle said 6.9% ABV (not the 8.5% that is listed).  The pour yields a clear, dark, golden apple juice colored body.  Beautiful pinpoint bubbles stream towards the surface, feeding a tall, foamy, off-white head.  Slowly, the foam recedes to a thin center film with a thick, ramped up edge that lasts.  Tall, splotchy, rounded flares of lace cling to the glass.  The nose starts out with notes of tart, musty apples, showing ample acetic sourness and hints of cider vinegar.  Softer lactic, milky, yeasty tartness is also prominent.  Dry brett is less noticeable.  Underlying malts are kind of sweet and appley.  Pumpkin is certainly nowhere to be found.  Flavors largely follow suit, loaded with sweet-tart apple and sweet cereal in the malt base.  Buggy brett is soft and earthen, touching also on some pineapple.  The acetic character is slightly softer than it is on the nose, taking on more of the milky, lactic elements.  Theres nothing overly complex going on here.  Its really just a vinegary, tart, buggy orchard fruit sour.  The palate checks in a bit heftier than medium bodied, due primarily to some saccharine sugars that linger after the crispness of the fine carbonation subsides.  Eh....not a huge fan of this one.  Its OK, but it could be a heck of alot more.  Disappointing coming from Allagash.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

69,"2011-12-03",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2011 (Drank as Ghoulschip.)  Never would I imagine giving such a high score to a damned pumpkin beer.  But here we are, with Allagash striking the perfect balance between a lovely sour ale and a nutty, sweet pumpkin brew.  Which means, of course, theres a good bit of sour and not much pumpkin.  But there is a toasty, nutlike backbone to the sourness, while the molasses oozes through on the finish, rounding out the oak with a textured, lovely fade.  One of the first beers we opened at this years War on Christmas Beer Party, supplied by Yonke, and it might be top three of the night.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

69,"2011-11-01",3.2,"Tap at Churchkey as Allagash Ghoulship. The pour is a hazy deep orange with a thin, yellow film for a head. Dwindles to a flat pour. No lace. Nose is very sharp vinous notes, balsamic, coconut, aceto heat, buttery pumpernickel bread. Taste up front is sour apples, moving to pretty heavy buttery apples. Finish is thin and tart with off flavors of cardboard and metals. Stinging mouthfeel. Much too buttery and no pumpkin flavor whatsoever.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

69,"2011-04-23",3.8,"Reviewed from notes. On cask at Night of the Funk. Pumpkin lambic, I like it already. Pour yields a hazy caramel-brown with a thin off-white head. Nose has a bit of pumpkin there, though Im sure thats a bit of bias knowing that its in there. Nonetheless, good notes of funk and Brett come through to dry this one out and throw in a really rustic character. The flavor does actually have a touch of gourd and earthy hay and funk. Pretty good and nicely unique, though nothing earth-shattering. Feel is a bit prickly given the serving format and has a nice mellow funk. Drinks quite well and certainly points for originality (along with a shout out to Jolly Pumpkin for working a similar concept).

69,"2010-01-22",3.2,"On tap at the 2009 Great Pumpkin Festival, Cambridge Brewing Company, Cambridge MA on 31 October 2009. This was billed as the worlds first Pumpkin Lambic and was the beer I had been anticipating most at the festival. However, whilst not bad, I found it a little disappointing. No discernible spicing (not sure there is supposed to be any), which was not a problem for me. However, it was neither as sour, nor as funky, as I had hoped. There was a subtle farmyard edge to the aroma and a gentle tartness but it was comprehensively outfunked by the Elysian Mr Yuck I had sampled earlier. Also a rather sweet mouthfeel. Admittedly it was still quite young so perhaps it will develop rather more funky action with time. As it at the moment though I couldnt rank it higher than middle of the road. Extra points for invention though.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Pumpkin starts to emerge towards the finish, nutmeg/cinnamon are very restrained for the style - pumpkin aspect is quite vegetal, clear, prominent towards the finish, melding with the yeasty, earthy spice on the finish.

69,"2008-10-01",4.1,"Woo-hoo, rating #1.  On tap at Blind Tiger.  Very hazy yellow-golden brew topped by a thick creamy white head.  Aroma is very musty and minerally with nice bretty perfumey notes.  Lots of crisp wheaty spiciness along with a touch of pumpkiny spice over that.  Very interesting brew.  Warming brings up a bit more pumpkiny aroma over that bretty/boney/minerally nose that invites me to drink even more of it.  Mmmm, wow, this is great.  The flavour is quite sticky/chewy initially but beyond that, there is a lot of pumpkin flavour.  Sort of wheaty with the pumpkin playing a dominent role.  Light cinnamon/clove but none of the typical allspice that seems to define this style.  The aroma is more intense than the flavour, which comes across quite sweet and a little bit starchy.  Also some lightly honeyish flavour, but with loads of bretty flavour as well and a bit of lingering citrus.  I really hope they bottle this, because the brett is only starting to dry this out... another four to five months and this will really come into it’s own.  A very unusual take on the style.  It’s like they did a cereal mash with loads of pumpkin, fermented it, then spiked it with brett.  Man, I love these guys... another solid brew.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
