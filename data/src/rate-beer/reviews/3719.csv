3719,"2017-05-19",2.9,"Can to mug, the appearance was a hazy burnt amber color with a sturdy fingers worth of white foamy head that fell off at a mild pace. Subtle strings of lace.
The aroma had some grapefruit pulpy sweetness, mild earthy hop tones and a caramel malt base.
The flavor was malty initially but brought in the grapefruit sweetness steadily. Aftertaste was malts and grapefruit. Finish was brisk yet malty sweet and dry.
The palate was medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt good what was projected.
Overall, I see in the description that the brewer says Irish red ale, so Im not going to be the one to change this to amber ale despite thats what I may think this is. Hey, though, thanks for the current Irish ale tick, haha.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3719,"2011-05-17",3.3,"A: The beer pours a copper color with a couple fingers of off-white head and a high level of carbonation

S: Smells of toffee and toasted bread with a bit of piney hops.  Not much citrus to it, but a little bit of floral and earthy notes.  Pretty simple aroma to the beer, but not bad.

T: Toasted bread is the dominant flavor.  There is some toffee and a little bit of caramel sweetness to it which is nice.  Subtle bitterness with a light hop flavor.

M: Medium in body with a moderate to high carbonation.

O: Overall a decent red, but I dont know if Id come back to this one.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3719,"2009-08-01",3.5,"Draft at the Tap House at the brewery.  Pours a reddish brown with a thin off white head.  Malty aroma alogn with some hops, sugar and caramel.  Pretty distinct taste for this brew.  I liked it.  Lots of malt, hops, caramel and bitterness.  Not a bad way to spend a Saturday afternoon - trying the pretty solid selections of a fairly new local brewery.","Morrisville, North Carolina, USA","brewski519"
3719,"2009-05-18",3.6,"Draft at Flying Saucer, Raleigh. The waitress said I was getting Aviators ESB (does one exist?) but the board said Hot Rod, so since it matched what others have said about this beer, Ill assume I had the Red.

Reddish/brown color, small but long lasting little white head. Quite noticeable bitter nose. It has a nice malty body but far more hoppiness than is standard for the style. It tasted wonderfully fresh, went down smooth, and left me wanting more. Good beer for my first from this new brewery.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","DukeBrewDevil"
3719,"2009-03-16",3.3,"Draught, at Tir na nog in downtown raleigh.  Pours with a decent whitish head, good retention, reddish body, a good bit hazy.  Has a sweet malty aroma, with some nut, hops, sugar, and has a nice floral bitter finish.  Fresh tasting malts, lively on the hops.  Pretty decent beer.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","wilkie"
3719,"2009-01-07",3.2,"from growler, good aroma, bitter sweet, citrus, biscuit, wet card board. Brownish orange color, got a good head with a vigorous pour, bitter sweet aroma, more citrus, grapefruit, less biscuit. medium body, creamy mouth feel, bitter finish, Good beer, aroma had nice mix as it seemed to jump around from sniff to sniff as what I smelled. Hoppier than other Irish reds Ive had, but thats OK","the Containment Area, North Carolina, USA","OldGrowth"
