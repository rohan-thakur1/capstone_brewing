2368,"2016-12-14",5.0,"Pours honey red from tap with small creamy head. Aroma sweet Leatherwood honey. Taste delicately sweet with perfectly balanced bitterness. Palate smooth worth some liveliness. Wonderful beer no matter your preferred style.","AUSTRALIA","charmarita"
2368,"2016-05-20",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2016 From a stubbie. Pours a slightly cloudy deep copper with a big foamy head that slowly reduces to an oily covering. Aroma is fruity and big. Massive pine, grapefruit, passionfruit, biscuity malts. Taste is fruity at the front with a complex bitter finish. Passionfruit, caramel, toffee, pine, earth. Boozey taste comes through at the end, surprising for a beer under 5%. Palate is thick, oily and smooth. Scrumptious.","AUSTRALIA","Itsumishi"
2368,"2016-02-12",3.9,"Bottle. Murky, Deep Amber red. Cream head. No lacing. Huge aroma of earthy hope with citrus backnotes and a big malt bill. Earthy hops and big caramel malt flavours. The alcohol pokes out towards the end which detracts slightly. Wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. Fantastic beer.

2368,"2016-01-23",3.3,"Very good sub 5% beer. Vaguely caramel malt and some soft herbal malts. Sweetens up a little on the finish but otherwise a classy beer.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

2368,"2015-07-08",3.1,"Poured a semi-opaque dark ruby red colour with a light tan collar that laced OK. Carbonation low and fine. Aroma lingers and is very nice of moderately strong fruity hops (tropical fruits, passionfruit) and a hint of spice. Taste is a nice mix of tropical fruit flavours with no one flavour being over-powering and underlying sweet malt plus a subdued bitterness. Light body. Smooth, clean, refreshing with a very slight bitterness on the finish. Very good.","Tarragindi, AUSTRALIA","KeefOz"
2368,"2015-04-26",3.6,"From 330 ml bottle. Pours a hazy brick red with orange highlights and a soft off-white head. Aromas of raisins, biscuits, flowers and caramel. Taste starts out with apple and raisins before orange zest and peppery/spice bitterness emerges. Some citrus, caramel and a floral note towards the end. Very nice.","Camp Hill, AUSTRALIA","Jado"
2368,"2015-04-13",3.6,"330mL bottle from Slowbeer
Pours a very attractive deep copper body, holding a persistent beige head.
Excellent nose; lots of hops - passionfruit, rockmelon, stone & tropical fruits, some pine-like spice, melding excellently with spicy rye notes of caraway & heavy toasted breads, toffee & nuts.
Smooth palate, slick, holds a fair more weight than the abv would suggest, subdued carbonation.
Delivers a solid nutty, toffee, somewhat grain malt body, hops a bit more subdued than aroma implied - subtle ripe tropical fruit & medium bitterness on the finish.
Very tasty Rye PA, well tempered, enough rye to keep things interesting.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
2368,"2015-02-13",3.8,"Brick red pour with decent beige head. Huge fruity, toffee aromas. Orange, toffee, a little spice, and nice little bit of lingering bitterness. Good one.","AUSTRALIA","varanid99"
2368,"2015-01-11",3.8,"Smells like a box of fruity chocolates! Opaque in the glass like caramel topping! Seriously! Solid tan head. This is a scary looking beer. Tastes like a forest! Wild intense pine and hops. Are we really calling this an Amber ale? As it warms coffee, bread (rye, I presume) toffee appear. Not for the faint-hearted (my wife had one mouthful and ran screaming from the room). Good serious beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"
2368,"2014-12-06",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2014 Bottle. Clear reddish amber with an off white head that lasts. Roomy aroma of spiced peel, bread, toffee, pine. Creamy texture. Rich for under 5%, with sticky breadcrusts, oranges, kumquat, spices, pine. Gently pinches into a moderately bitter and moderately dry finish. A very harmonious and satisfying beer. Smaller bottle, rather less good. A bit flabby sweetness, finish seems less dry. Less fresh, too warm?","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

2368,"2014-09-05",3.8,"Pours a nice amber with hints of deep red, thick and creamy, ivory colored head. Nose is a sweet, floral affair - also picking up grass and slight pine hints. A really well balanced beer - sweet and floral upfront combined with a little bit of pine followed by a big bitter finish. Tastes way bigger than its 4.8% would suggest. Mouth feel - resinous and dense with a good mouth coat and a gentle carbonation.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","whoisghost"
2368,"2014-08-09",4.0,"Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours amber with a small beige head. Nose is a great concoction of spice, earth and pine. Pine and spice driven in the taste with mild tropical fruits and sweetness coming through. For a sub 5% beer this is fantastic","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
2368,"2014-07-30",3.7,"Solid sessionable beer.
As the label suggests - pine and fruit salad aromas, a light mouth feel with up front bitterness and a fair whack of tropical fruit. Bitterness at the back end fades surprisingly quick, considering the initial punch of bitterness.","banksia grove, AUSTRALIA","hank37"

2368,"2013-10-25",3.8,"Dark amber with a nice creamy off-white head.
Strong aromatic beer, big floral and citrus notes. Cinnamon and caramels also come through.
Creamy and bitter. Nice caramel and toffee malts, with a great kick of grassy hop bitterness. Citrus and light pine resins, fit the malts nicely.
A bitter sweet finish, strong citrus bitterness and bready malt.

Nose shows tropical fruit including melon, papaya, passion fruit and lychee along with fruit confectionery and a little bready malt.
Maltier flavours, with caramel, bready and toasty malt and a little spicy rye. Some of the fruit confectionery follows along with an assertive bitterness.

2368,"2013-09-24",3.3,"On tap at deja vu. The aroma is a lovely combination of orange, spice, citrus, raisins and a little sawdust. The taste is not as complex, featuring grapefruit and spice, and mostly lacking a strong malt structure. The palate is a little thin, but it?s a beautiful looking redhead, especially when swirling around the glass.","AUSTRALIA","LesArgen"
