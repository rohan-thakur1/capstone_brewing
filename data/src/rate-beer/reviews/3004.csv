3004,"2015-05-16",3.4,"300ml bottle bought at Wellcome Superstore in Sheung Shui.
Clear, near colourless with very pale greenish yellow hue; Quite fragrant aroma of glutinous rice wine, with fairly strong pear flesh, floral, pollen, light perfume, strong alcohol, sugar and sweet rice soup; Mid to strong sweet taste of rice wine, with medium tartness, moderate warming alcohol, light pear flesh, sugar notes and light liquorices; Light body, thin and wet palate; Mouth feel is sweet-based, slightly dry Nama with moderate tartness good enough to counter the rather strong sweetness. Pear ester is light but testable. The 12.5% booze is notable but incredibly smooth without harshness and only slightly warm, with light liquorices bitterness makes it very easy to down. A real plus! Slightly dry after taste; Nice sweet and very easy to mouth.

Comments: This is one of the few rare case of a Nama Sake without the trademark harsh booze. Well made with nice flowery and peary aroma, plus neat tartness and sweet palate. Very easy to drink without losing much of the Nama characters. A crowd pleaser and I like it!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

This is my first sake rating, so Im going to keep this simple. Gentle sweet fruitness, but surprisingly smooth and transparent at fridge temperature. As it warms, the orchard flavors -- asian pear, Id say -- come through much more. Very enjoyable. I dont really know how to rate aroma or appearance here.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
3004,"2013-04-16",3.4,"Glass at tenzan.  Pours clear with light tropical fruit nose. Tastes of vanilla, coconut, light melon, rice and a hinge if alcohol. Smooth and uneventful.","New York, USA","Jow"
3004,"2012-06-04",3.6,"To put it shortly, this is a good sake for those who are just coming into the sake world. 
This is an approachable sake, smooth, no harshness whatsoever. 
However, i find this one to be lacking in the taste department. I take my first sip and its a very down to earth type of flavor. Youll spot all the core ingredients here with the water, and rice, but thats as far as the adventure goes. 
But due to the price, its not exactly a big loss, but my personal opinion is to look elsewhere.

3004,"2012-01-15",3.8,"Bottle. Pours clear, almost imperceptibly pale yellow. The aroma is primarily marzipan, with hints of fruit and alcohol. Still, medium body. Lightly sweet taste of marzipan, pear, with a slightly astringent finish that is almost woody but not quite. Either Im starting to appreciate Sake more, or this stuff is pretty good!","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"
3004,"2011-09-03",3.7,"Bottle split with linh, Vi and Thi at kati. Pours a clear water body. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth and inviting with notes of fruit, dry alcohol and almost candy in the back.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3004,"2011-08-15",3.8,"Kind of a light Sake. Flavor is not at all harsh, goes down cleanly. At $5 a bottle, its worth checking out.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
3004,"2011-03-18",3.3,"Had with Steph at tenzan.  Powdery, soft and silky.  Delicate but then some alcohol cuts that out.","Manhattan, New York, USA","Pwn3d"
3004,"2010-08-26",2.7,"(300ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours a transparent body with descent legs.  Aroma of rice milk, marzipan, and almonds.  Flavor of rice, alcohol, and somewhat dirty.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"

3004,"2010-08-02",3.6,"Bought at Central Market. Clear. Aroma is pretty sweet with some alcohol. Flavor is a little bit of grain and rice with some sweetness. A pretty good sake, though nothing outstanding.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3004,"2009-02-10",3.0,"A nama sake - looking for bright, raw flavors, but finding a curious Southwestern blend instead!  A clear sake, standard fare in the non-nigori world, with a strong piercing aroma, smelling of mushrooms, salted foods, bell pepper freshness and a new furniture smell.  Very curious!  And tantalizing too, even though furniture varnish may not sound very appetizing.  In contrast, the taste is dull yet fruity, then transitions into an abrupt, neutral and watery break, before returning to its dull and fruity conclusion.  Of the fruits I can identify cantaloupe, mush melon and kiwi feature most prominently.  The flavors are a bit dull and dead, but still present and qualifiable.  The alcohol adds a nice vibrato.  That is, what twitches of liveliness this sake has comes purely from the alcohol, but even then the flavors feel faded and wan.  Most notable is the large gap between the sakes aroma and flavors - on one end savory and salty, on the other, fruity and pale.  More strange than good, but I still like it.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3004,"2008-04-12",3.4,"I was actually surprised that this was a namasake. Clear pour with nice legs. Nose is dry a bit of rice and some fruit. Taste is sweet and very smooth and balanced. Decent finish. Not bad.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
3004,"2008-02-19",3.5,"Served chilled. Very good value here. Aroma is very dry with abit of sweetness in the background and a bit of alcohol. Body is clear as watery with extremly long lasting and running legs. Taste is very well rounded and balanced, maybe with that sort of sterile vodka taste. Goes down creamy, but a bit on the dry side considering its temperature. Not bad.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

3004,"2007-09-03",3.6,"300ml bottle from puzzl; nose of riciness and some sweetness; crystal clear transparency, no off hues; extremely smooth and drinkable, very slight sweetness, light grainy feel on my tongue. A very good sake, one of the best of the 10 I have tried.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
3004,"2007-07-29",3.0,"$6 300ml. Clear pour. Light, ricey aroma. Not very bold. Thin, meandering  flavor, slight rice, maybe toffee. Little going on. Very drinkable, I guess, because it doesnt taste like much.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3004,"2006-08-28",2.4,"Bottle from Nijiya Market. Served chilled. Very clear in color. Sweet aroma of rice and marshmellows. A little alcohol as well. Sweet candy flavor.  Some rubbing alcohol. Warming going down.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
3004,"2005-12-06",3.3,"Clear color, nose of strong rustic koji and alcohol. Dry and dusty mouth feel. Not very refined, it makes me thirsty for some water as its just sucking all moisture from it. The pro on this one is the lack of alcohol feel, but its not very high anyways.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3004,"2005-08-17",3.3,"yet another gift from nuffield, thanks. clear pour. smells of acorns and vanilla. smooth sweet taste with a cream like finish. slight metallic flavor and a paper taste are the only drawbacks here.nice almond and vanilla flavor though.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
3004,"2005-07-24",2.4,"Bottle. Not one of the finer sakes that I have tried. Nose reminds me of kitty litter-dusty and NH4. Taste-bark, nuts, vanilla. The after taste is dirty and unenjoyable. Ill pass.","Carrollton, Texas, USA","Lumpy"
3004,"2005-05-21",3.4,"I dont think this is the most sophisticated sake of the limited number Ive had, but I quite enjoyed this as an after-dinner sipping drink about 10 p.m.  I started with it ice cold, and it had layers of richness: caramel, Kahlua, hazlenut, cream, Baileys, nuts, vanilla....all of the qualities of a good mixed drink.  The alcoholic sting came out a bit more as it warmed, and there isnt that much in the aroma, but overall I was very happy to drink this, and even the alcoholic sting had a salutary effect on my palate, which had been deadened by a rich meal.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3004,"2005-04-30",3.0,"Bottle served chilled.  Clear with perhaps just a greenish? tint.  Alcohol in the nose.  Perhaps a bit fruity.  Fairly smooth with no real harsh qualities.  Decent.","Alabama, USA","11026"
