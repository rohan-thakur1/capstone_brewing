The beer is transparent and golden hued, plentiful bubbles rapidly ascending to the surface. Even after a slow and careful pour, the head is a few inches thick, receding to a half inch and holding.

The aroma offers yeast, malt, citrus, spice, alcohol. Not picking up the oak characteristic I expected.

The oak comes through quite a bit in the flavor. A bit tart, with a nice blend of spice and floral notes. Lingering notes of wood in the finish. Well balanced and flavorful.

Alcohol content hidden pretty well. Warming finish. Medium-full bodied.

Overall, a really solid beer. Very glad to have this, as I missed batches 23 and 46.

T - Starts off with some pear and other light fruits with some citrus zest, coriander, and other Belgian yeast flavors. Through the middle, the oak comes through alongside some stronger yeast character with some pepper and some farmhouse flavors. The finish is a mix of citrus and light fruit flavors with some bready yeast, oak, vanilla, and some booze.

3240,"2012-05-22",3.6,"You tend to associate ""oak aged"" beers with stouts, but what about a Belgian Strong Pale Ale? Thats the concept behind Russian River Damnation Batch 23 - a unique twist on their regular brew where every 23rd batch is brewed with extra hops and aged on oak chips with a stronger final ABV and is consider a tripel. I cant say that this brewing technique made the beer any better, although the net result is certainly an interesting and unique beer.

NOTE: I had this beer in my fridge for literally seven months. Its possible I didnt get the same experience one would receive if drinking the beer fresh.

I received 375ml corked and caged bottle from a friend in the San Francisco area (thanks, Sean!). I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Bright orange hue, mostly translucent with slight haze, although fine, spastic carbonation is visible. Initially forms a huge, fluffy, white head which eventually settles down and does not leave much lacing on the glass.

Smell: Mild hop citrusy notes and light flower/candy fragrances. 

Taste: I had no idea what to expect with Russian River Damnation Batch 23. I thought the regular version was a good beer and an extra hoppy brew aged on oak chips could only make it better. I was surprised to find this beer was only as good as the original brew. More hops definitely are noticeable with a light citrusy flavor throughout the palate, especially of orange and a subtle tropical fruit juice cocktail at the core, too. A quick hop bite through the middle with a kiss of candy sweetness on the finish. Theres a mild vanilla taste in there as well, likely due to the oak chips. 

But much like the regular Damnation, this beer isnt quite as complex as youd think. Its these same few flavors repeated, without much development. Thankfully the alcohol is extremely well masked and the sweetness is never sticky or cloying. I did get a minor hint of black pepper, but nothing comparable to a Chimay White, etc. Its satisfying for sure, but for such a unique and rare beer youd expect something a little more impressive. 

Drinkability: The mouthfeel is quite thin and crisp like an authentic Belgian tripel. The clean aftertaste is a nice change of pace, although its not what I would consider extremely smooth since carbonation does get stuck in the throat after each swig.  While I wasnt completely wowed by the palate of Russian River Damnation Batch 23, I definitely have to give it kudos for being so drinkable for such a hefty brew. At 10.75% ABV is there no alcohol presence here at all. Just a slight warmth in the throat, but no alcohol distraction in the palate.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3240,"2012-04-30",3.9,"Originally reviewed: 3/12/12. Had this one on-tap at Tonys Darts Away in Burbank. 

Bartender poured into this into a tall tulip glass, revealing a slightly hazy golden hue. A finger-widths worth of creamy foam capped it off. The nose is sharp with Belgian yeast, lemon zest, faint tangerine. The mouthfeel was much smoother than anticipated, aided by the oak chips, no doubt. Light bubbly finish. Light hoppy flavors meld well with the yeast character, and then finishes with a mildly-tart citrus snap. Spicy lemons come to mind with this beer. I liked it quite a bit. RR has made another standout brew here. Glad I had the opportunity.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

3240,"2011-12-12",3.7,"Draft at RRBC and from bottle. Pretty moonlit hazed honey-gold and nice lacing and head. Immediately smells sweet and yeasty in draft version. Less so from the bottle, where it is dryer and more refined. Still overt Belgian yeast character but subtler with the bottle conditioning. The bottle version is mellower but still tastes too sweet for me, with again the overt Belgian yeast character not fermented or dry enough. So much like what happens to a Unibroue on draft or in the small bottles not given enough chance to do its thing. The aroma has subdued fruit, lychee pear pineapple almost smells like Unibroue with some ripe mashed banana with coriander, mashed fruit salad, and the wood adds astringency to the palate more than it adds to the flavors. Apples and peaches, deskinned, fruit salad. The palate is soft like velour, almost too soft. A livelier, pricklier carbonation wouldnt hurt and might lift it a bit. Does have great fruit character. Mostly unripe/green carambola. Acidity that is subdued but just enough to affect the palate more so than the flavors. Lots of unripe random subtropical tree fruit. Some tart apples and white grapes. Hardly any tannins in the finish, I would want more. You have to really search for the wood and when it is found, it manifests as a kiss of vanilla tobacco sweets. Which is kinda strange.

Its not until after a few whiffs do I get a strong oak character.

T- Flavor contains a hint of smoke initially and dry woody oak. Background contains a good amount of spicy belgian yeast. The finish is actually very spicy with the spicy yeast increasing and what seems to be a ginger hotness. A moderate amount of spicy heat lingers on for awhile.

Pours a hazy golden orange, summer dusk sun with a huge offwhite leaning towards beige cakey head, very well carbonated and lively. Aromas are the telltale fruity ester base of Damnation, citrus and banana come into focus, a slight apple with light yeasty Belgian character, not overdone or overspiced, instead playing to the fruit side of things with a touch of buttery oak underneath, a touch of wet wood and slight vanilla mellow feel. Initial is fuller, lighter side of medium bodied with a lively carbonation and a fairly prominent alcohol base. Fruity banana, pear, apple, spicey Belgian yeast, a grainy malt base moving into a sweeter spiced ale. The beer is served well by the oak chips, with some wet oak, a touch of butter, vanilla coming and playing on. A bit more muted in sweetness as we get in after the initial shock, this beer becomes surprisingly smooth, light sweetness and smoothed out oak to round the edges. The beer laces very the well, the head staying huge throughout. I love how a lot of the spicy yeast starts to die out, the oak playing a more prominent role of taming the spice and sweetness, making a smooth and becoming easily quaffable beer. A finish that becomes a bit drier, the hops coming to life, the elements still sticking to the palate, sweet and oaky, light spice, smoothed out, dry finish from decent hop profile.

New American oak imparts ample vanilla, along with a good amount of woody spice.  The flavor is rich with honeyed, fresh grain malt, hinting at honey wheat bread dipped in cream.  Oak again offers up vanilla and lightly toasted spice, while a smattering of floral hops lends just a hint of countering bitterness.  The finish is quite oaky.

Flavors brighten quickly and give off mercurial sweet sugars in line with lemoncello, white wine, and almond paste. Sugars are immediately chewy and the alcohols prickle the tongue. Im having trouble digging depth out of this beer, though. Theres a run of oak dryness, some curt vanillic acids, and a bit of northern Indian spice mixture. Dryed out and slightly past-peak hop leafiness bring up the backend. Solid brewing and a decent beer, but maybe not as wildly successful an effort as Id hoped.

Aroma detected was a strong strain of Belgian yeast and spices which ultimately satisfied the nose. Flavor was strong with the usual suspects accompanied with Belgian yeast but an ever present background of wood chips, tart cherries and perhaps a chardonnay wine finished with an interesting taste compared to the original version.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Lovely sweet French oak barrel, Belgian yeast, cloves, and lots of lighter fruits (apples, grapes, peaches).  Effervescent mouthfeel, very light.  Compliments the flavor nicely.  Sweet peaches and white grapes up front, even sweeter yeast and malt.  Nive vanilla/clove spice combo, close to what you may find in a trippel.  The oak gives this a flavor far different than the usual Damnation.  It is still sweet, but the slight earthiness keeps this from being sickening.  Dry finish.  Great beer.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"

It tasted odd to me then but as I made short work of the steak and move to cheese slices with rosemary crackers, it was like drinking a different beer. Initially, I thought it rough and a bit like a young Cabernet, brash & tannic, I wasn’t impressed. A combination of the beer warming, and my palate switching gears as I moved from the steak into cheese both melded this into a sweet, rich tripel. It is still a bit bold (American oak, I wonder how it would have been if aged in French Oak?) I enjoyed the herbal hops at the finish.

Pleasant flavor of banana, pear and clove similar to regular Damnation. The oak aging is faint, I was expecting more prominence. Easy finish with a thinned body. Pretty damn good, but I dont see it beating Damnation by much.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

3240,"2008-01-08",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2008 Two ratings of this one:  First time I had a bit of the bottom of the bottle, and I guess it was yeast-heavy because it was cloudy and the funk of the nose was fairly prominent.  It had a gassy funk to it, a really nice woody farmhouse scent along with some of the more expected clove, lemon, banana and candy sugar notes.  I was amazed by the dryness and tartness, but after sampling from another bottle a few months later, I could see that what I got was muddled by the yeast.  It was delectable, mind you, but it was still muddled.  So on to the second time I got to try this, thanks to eclectic for sharing a bottle.  The funk wasn’t there, I was so surprised, and instead it was some lightly sweet hay and lemon scents, very similar to the standard Damnation, with only a small wet/green wood note in the nose to indicate the use of oak chips.  Flavor-wise it was also a surprise, with some light dryness but nearly none of the funk or tartness that the yeast contained.  Rather, it was clean, crisp, and leaning slightly to the sweeter side of things, with a somewhat bland finish, and it left me a little deflated.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Flavor suffers under the weight of its heat; quiet sparks of mint, lemonade and pepper flash momentarily only to be quickly extinguished by the tranquilizing force of honey and alcohol.  Still, this is not offensively overpowering, however damaging it is to the complexity of the broader picture, rendering it uninteresting in its basic presentation.  Brisk in the mouth, while heavy.

3240,"2007-10-05",4.2,"25.4 ounce bottle all to myself at Toronado (by the time I finished this, I was shitfaced).    Aroma initially is very wine like--almost smells like a cabernet.  Quite vinous with woody, oak, and vanilla hints.  Some lightly banana-like yeasty easters are also appreciated with some butterscotch present, too.  Interesting aroma that is pleasant.  Mildly hazy honey- colored body with a moderately frothy off-white head.  Killer lacking makes this a 4/5.  Has that mellow, lightly sweet, vanilla, oaky flavor to start.  Some marshmellows are also present along with sweet, caramelly, chewy, nutty malt flavors in the middle.  Finishes with a little butterscotch.  Great mouthfeel.  I was skeptical of this beer and all of the hype, but this beer just hits many chords for me.

3240,"2007-09-16",3.9,"Pours cloudy gold with mellow orange hues and a thin, pure white head. Slow recession, not quite fully for a long while. The aroma is that of an incredibly sweet tripel, first and foremost. Candi sugar leaps from the glass by the pound. Alcohol is strong and fruity. Oak is very intense, never overdone but definitely not shy. Hops are herbal and grassy and wet, full-on and adequate in amount. Notes of mixed fruit basket is moderate but leans toward heavy. The flavor has very good depth, much more than a standard tripel or trhe average oak aged Belgian whatever. Incredible development of subtleties starts immediately, malt extraction is far and away finished. Pineapple floats just above the rest of the flavor and nods in and out. Highly sugary-sweet - but sugars are very complex and admirably placed within. Wood character is exceedingly deep and only lightly tannic, just fresh. Bitterness is low, astringency low, acidity low-mild. The finish is mildly sweet but quickly becomes off-dry and candy coated. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and tangentially wild, extremely complex, buttery, slippery but firm like beer jello, spicy, comforting, blanketing and velvety. Not incredible but this is no joke either, very good and as always: Russian River delivers a very drinkable and authentic beer. This outing has a distinctly American twist that is neither hit or miss for my palate, just another wood-aged beer that happens to be tasty.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3240,"2007-09-07",4.1,"Bottle from... wait its a secret! He told me not to say. ;)

Had during a blind tasting with four other tripels. It was immediately obvious which one this was. The oak is prominent and lovely, and the unforgettable aroma of the normal damnation was apparent and lovely.  Smelling this beer is like heaven. Oak, bready yeast, light spices... deep with aromas I have never smelled, and bursting with fresh aromas of some of my favorite foods. Brilliant. Much like normal damnation, the flavor is not quite up to par, but in this beer it is a lot better, with rich oak notes, spicy belgian yeast and good christmas type flavors... pine, berries, cinnamon. Not too harsh on the palate for an 11% tripel, though I certainly wouldnt call it very drinkable. This is a world class beer, and is very enjoyable.

3240,"2007-08-21",4.0,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Pours a crystal clear color of pale gold, topped with a quickly dissipating head of fizzy, sudsy white.  Loads of vanilla.  Notes of oak and mild pineapple fruitiness add some complexity to the nose, but the vanilla character is quite strong.   A mild yeasty spice adds more desirable depth, while a touch of boozey character warns of the high ABV.  Medium bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel.  Exceptionally clean and for lack of a better description, tastes well executed.  The flavors start out with some apricot brandy dried with a hint of oak.  This opens up to some yeasty spice and soothing vanilla.  A peppery spice lingers in the final smack.  Finish is a touch hot, but not offensive.  I like this.

Sweet without being cloying. Dry without feeling like the Sahara. Soft, like silk, this is an amazing beer.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
3240,"2007-08-10",4.0,"Yellow gold. Frothy white head yields patchy lace as it slowly subsides. Bright and perfumey aromas of honey-caramelized bananas, coriander, straw, and refined oak. Taffylike yeast character. Aromas are just glowing. Soothingly soft carbonation. A succulent and dense fruitiness immediately unfolds on the palate and is soon met by a supple explosion of lemon, floral hops, and peppery alcohol which accentuates the sweet and spicy clove and coriander. Nutty oak slices through the slick fruitiness and densely juicy core in a scratchy yet clean fashion, but is brilliantly utilized and understated and harmonizes with the ever-building lush foundation of chewy straw. Alcohol imparts a spicy dryness, but is otherwise nary a factor. Clean as a whistle, overall, and impeccably attenuated. Orangey roundness adds to the refinement and bolsters the drinkability. Yeast adds structure as well as a cheesy and taffylike creaminess which absorbs much of the alcoholic warmth. Exceptionally polished oak lends bounce rather than grit to the body. Hop character is remarkably soft, floral, spicy and juicy. Dazzling interplay between the juicy oak and rich straw. Finishes moistly full and warming with exemplary integration between the oak, pie-crust malts, green banana, honeysuckle, and vanilla taffy which is delivered via the combo of oak and yeast. Love the unique spin on the original Damnation. Compared to the 4-5 batches of Damnation Ive experienced, this edges them out by a thin margin. Alcohol seems less apparent than the standard batches, which are significantly lower in alcohol than this, and thats yet another testament to Vinnies masterfulness. A successful rendition Ill say.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3240,"2007-08-07",4.6,"Bottle from IrishBoy.  Trying after watching the movie The Number 23.  Its an interesting number.  Color is a very light amber, with a very thin white head.  Aroma is apples, nutmeg, yeast, oak, vanilla.  Taste is a heavy vanilla and oak content followed by the traditional Damnation spiciness of nutmeg and cloves; has a light content of alcohol which comes across in a positive way, has a llight sweetness in the end also.  This just makes me understand why Russian River is my far and away favorite brewery.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
3240,"2007-07-30",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 7, 2007 Quite oak-like in the aroma, but it is not overpowering & in fact took me a second to recognize.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, copper tinged, gold color and is topped by a frothy, initially two-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head.  Aromatic notes of buttery oak, vanillin, orange zest, and a light, yet sharp, spicy oak character.  The hints of vanilla and orange remind me a bit of an orange-cream candy, though the aroma is fairly dry smelling.  Boozy notes of warm alcohol are present, especially if you linger too long over the nose.  Slightly must, but overall the aroma is nice, but not all that striking.  It actually might not be the alcohol alone that is noticeable, but really a lot of the spicy oak character that is accentuating a sharpness / hotness in the aromatic finish.

The taste is quite a bit sweeter than the aroma suggested, but it is well within line for a beer of this strength.  The sweetness accentuates a note of orange / lemon zest.  This beer is actually fairly dry over all & becomes lightly sweet as my palate adjusts to it.  The beer finishes with a mix of hot, higher alcohols, bitter hops, some light phenolics & spicy oak character.  The oak / barrel character is quite a bit more subtle than the aroma would have suggested, which in my opinion is a good thing.  Oak notes of vanillin, spicy, woody oak and a touch of tannic astringency are all noticeable if you dig a bit, but really they contribute to the overall character of this beer.  Really the oak, while not hugely apparent individually, does have a large effect on the flavor profile of this beer (from the vanilla notes, the spicy character, to the perception of bitterness, astringency & alcohol in the finish).  Floral notes of honeysuckle, orange blossom and bird of paradise add an interesting component to the flavor profile.  The residual sugars provide a nice, softly creamy, heft to this beer that makes this beer contemplative; it is nothing like a chewy, all malt beer (like a Barleywine), as it is fairly light for its strength.  In fact, at times it is down right drinkable; I think a big part of this is that the carbonation helps to refresh and lighten up the overall perception of this beer.

This beer definitely is strong, while the 10.5% does not quite hit you over the head, it is still noticeable.  I really am enjoying the soft, orange like flavors & aromas in this beer; these notes pair quite well with some of the oak components.  I have a feeling this beer will age quite well for a long time.  In fact, this beer really needs to age for quite some time as it is a bit too young right now; perhaps a year but maybe even three would do this beer wonders  To tell you the truth, I wouldnt be surprised if this peaked at 5 or 10 years even.  It is certainly not a bad tipple right now, it is just that I see this getting a lot better.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3240,"2007-07-30",3.9,"750 ml bottle shared at Columbus Tasting 8 from Irishboy! - thanks Richard! - Pours amber with a short white head and a fair amount of lace.  Aromas of yeast, oak, and some vanilla.  Flavor is oaky with some yeast, bread, and that always present Russian River tartness.  Smooth and easy drinking with good carbonation and a soft mouthfeel.  Nicely done..","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
3240,"2007-07-29",3.9,"Bread, fruit and wood blending together to remind me of a light spiced, pickled peach aroma. Hazy color of ripe peach flesh with a white head that flattened but laces a little. Medium bodied. Moderate, creamy carbonation. Its definitely sweet and spicy. The peachy fruit brings back that spiced peach memory. I think we called them pickled, but they were not sour; too much sugar. Anyway, the oak sort of astringates* the mouth, and the bitter just pushes the sensation further. There is a low key medicinal phenolic note as the other flavors diminish. The oak seems to last the longest. This is the most exceptionally drinkable ale. Phew.

3240,"2007-07-29",3.8,"Pale orange with moderate, fine head. Moderate oakey aroma with some spiky citrusness and leafy, peachy yeastiness. Woodiness is subdued and vaguely earthy rather than sharp and singular. Playfully tart at the beginning of the sip, apples, peaches, light phenols, hot bitterness. Warm, agreeable long-lasting finish, slowly titrating bitterness. Lots of tart aromatics tingle your nostrils.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

Dry, tangy, paint-thinner like ripple in the nostrils, but in a good way if that makes sense.","Winchester, Massachusetts, USA","GriffinAvenue"

3240,"2007-07-25",3.9,"Bottle shared by eclectic at BCTC 07.  Thanks Kevin!  Poured a hazy golden yellow with a good sized white head and lacing that lasts throughout. Aroma is oak, spices, lemon, banana, earthy yeast, vanilla, and a mild hoppiness. Flavor is equally spicey and fruity and you can really taste the oak chips and vanilla, though they dont detract from the other flavors.  Pretty smooth for the abv, though some alcohol could be noted. Nice beer, but Id probably prefer it without the oak chip aging.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Lingering vanilla, oak, and spice. Medium body, Alcohol present, but not overpowering. Some summer fruitiness. Good beer, but a bit too much vanilla for my tastes.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
3240,"2007-07-18",4.0,"On Tap at the Toronado.  Very light vanilla oak flavor - definitely not strong wood or oak flavors.  Damnation on steroids.  Lots of the same appearance characteristics, a little more hop presence, but definitely still a very dry and clean beer.  Awesome earthy, plum like fruity esters from the yeast - probably from Russian Rivers proprietary WLP500-like yeast.   Very excellent beer.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"
