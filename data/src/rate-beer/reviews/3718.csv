3718,"2013-10-27",3.0,"I thought this was too highly carbonated for a red ale. After pouring nicely the head took on a life of its own and grew up out of the glass, with various shades of off white. Strong malt flavor up front, and malty finish with little bitterness. Would have preferred more of a balance but its not a bad drink at all, just a bit gassy.","Swords, IRELAND","liamagester"
