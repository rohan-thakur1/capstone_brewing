4287,"2015-04-16",3.0,"Pours clear light orange, a little darker than the average lager. Aroma is grass, cracked wheat. Taste is bread, more grass, some spice from the hops. Pretty full flavored crisp and refreshing. Problem is a slight diacetyl note in the finish, which others have noticed so I dont think its just this batch, Not bad at all, for the style.","","kespecial"

4287,"2014-05-23",3.2,"This is rather hoppy for a helpless but pretty tasty regardless. It is a hazy orange yellow with a fine bubbled head and a lattice of lacing. It has a mild nose with just a touch of cut hay and citric hops. It seems like it might be a bit sweet but really doesnt come across as such since its quite bitter as well. Some doughy malts come out as the beer warms. This is medium bodied but lightened by crisp carbonation. I would call this an American take on a pilsener. It has a clean yeast character but drinks like an American pale ale.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The mild aroma offers up spicy hops and some floral like hoppiness. The taste is rich and crisp and vibrant with cereal graininess, bitter floral hops, a bit of lemon and lime like citrus hop bitterness and then it picks up a bit more graininess into the finish. It leaves behind a pleasing crisp hop bitterness into the after taste.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

S - Aroma is a very nice balance of light biscuity malts, citrus hops, and some light fruity esters from the yeast.

T - Starts off with some sweet biscuit malt wit ha nice balance of citrus hops and some lager esters in the background. Through the middle, some richer malt with a touch more hops and some light bitterness comes though.

4287,"2011-11-07",3.1,"10 ounce sample on tap at Jupiter in Berkeley.  The aroma has some light biscuit and grassiness present. Mild fruitiness, too.  Not to much else here.  Transparent golden body with a small, whitish head, that is pretty weak.  Starts a bit sweet with some corn-like flavors.  Has some biscuit in the middle before this finishes snappy and grassy.  Nice maltiness in this beer.  Its crisp and refreshing.  I still prefer Sudwerks Helles, though.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Big hoppy aroma with lots of spice an evergreen, a touch of sulpher and a sweet pils malt graininess. Joppy in te flavor from start to finish. A bit mjnerally and sulphery in a good way. Malt sweetness an bitterness balance very well and bitterness beats malt out in the finish. Medium body with smooth carbonation. Hoppy stuff with a delicious mix of hops. A bit big on body for a German pils but out of this world hoppy to be anything else, so in short, a Moonlight beer, which is just what I wanted.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

4287,"2010-07-21",3.5,"I had a couple of pints of this yesterday at some random pizza place alongside the Russian River.  Anyway, this is probably about as good as a lager can get.

4287,"2010-07-09",3.7,"Had this at Monks Kettle.

Pours a crystal clear, brilliant golden color with a two-finger lasting foamy white head.  Good lacing.

Aroma is grainy pale malt, a touch of caramel, and floral hops.  Very pronounced for the style and very balanced.

Slightly sweet and bready pilsner malt on the flavor, slight graininess, floral hops, and slight citrus.  Great for a helles lager.  This is what the style should always be.

Clean and crisp on the palate with a good carbonation level and medium-light body.

Overall, an absolutely killer pale lager.  Wish they were all this good.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
4287,"2010-06-28",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Lascivious cereal and frothy foam massage this quenching Helless evolving herbal hop bitterness, making you grab a larger sip each time.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam decorates the misty dark gold. 
-That noble hop finish is really scrumptious.
-The pillowy foam and chewy, smooth body make a beautiful mouthfeel.
-This may have more body than the usual blond lager, but it remains much more drinkable than their Uncle Svensen.

Medium mouthfeel: zesty mineral and herbal bitterness coupled to a toasty breadiness, very dry and crisp presence; refreshing, zesty hops and bubbles on the tip of the tongue; hints of green olives.

Aroma is lightly hoppy (lightly herbal), and just clean light malts with a hint of fruity lagerness. The flavor losses the lager fruitiness, which is good.

4287,"2008-09-28",4.2,"On tap at 515 in Santa Cruz. Poured into a big pilsener glass. Clear golden amber color with two fingers of tan head. Nice thick lacing and substantial retention. Aromas of bread and caramel malt with some hop citrus that melds nicely. Flavor is bready with some lactic character. A touch of caramel malt and a nice piney hop finish with moderate bitterness. Kinda of like an overhopped Boston Lager. Great balance, perfect carbonation, semidry finish, excellent drinkability.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
4287,"2008-07-25",2.8,"Poured from tap a slightly hazy light yellow with small white head.  Aroma was of hay and barnyard. The flavor was much of the same grassy hay with barnyard notes along with a tart bitterness and a small bit of toast.  As for palate, I would call this a palate cleanser because it squeezed most other flavors out of my mouth leaving a puckering tartness.  I think I’ll skip this one next time.","El Cerrito, California, USA","rayOfBeer"
4287,"2007-12-10",4.5,"On tap at Flavor, Santa Rosa.  This is a very nice, tasty, hoppy lager.  It is golden with a big, thick white head that lasts for a long time, slowly diminishing to a smaller, foamy head that leaves fairly good lacing.  The aroma is malty grain, bread, somewhat sweet with definite piney hops lingering in the back.  The taste is malty, bready, with some nut and a  pronounced piney hop bitterness soon coming through to balance out the grain sweetness.  It has a crisp finish and a long, nice grain/biscuit/nut aftertaste.  It is refreshing and crisp, but flavourful, with some complexity,  both a good lightly toasted malt and a piney hop bitterness being very prominent.  The balance is nice.","California, USA","Wulfstan"

Grain, light noble hop character in the nose. The overall taste has notes of grain, light caramel, grass and a light twinge of lemon.

Slightly more flavor than I expected from a lager. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with a touch of roasted malts.
