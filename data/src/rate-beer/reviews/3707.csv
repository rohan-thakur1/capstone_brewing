3707,"2013-08-24",3.3,"A sweet malt nose. Flavor is sweet as well. Again a slight vanilla character and slickness on the tongue. With a lingering bitterness to the finish. Tastes tend more toward fruit, almost like a raspberry as it warms. Interesting

3707,"2013-04-17",3.3,"4 oz sampler draft at the brewpub in Boca Raton, Florida.  The pour is a clear copper red, with a small off white head.  The aroma is caramel malt, along with a bit of grass.  The taste is caramel melt, slight baking sweetness, and a hint of roast in the back.  The grass is evident in the finish.  The palate is medium to light bodied, a low carbonation level, and a light natural sweet finish.  Solid red.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3707,"2013-02-27",3.0,"A hazed reddish amber with a thin off white head. In aroma, a grassy malt with chalky notes, so-so. In mouth, a caramel malt with brassy malt, OK. On tap at brewpub, Feb. 13 2013.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
3707,"2013-02-24",3.6,"Brewvival 2013. Dark red pour with a small head. Aroma was caramel for days. Nice sweetness up front that turned toward fruity with just a hint of vanilla. Flavors were sweet and caramel dominated with a touch of spicy hops on the back end. Rather one dimensional.  Medium body.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
3707,"2013-02-10",2.7,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted, caramelized cereals bump into burnt edges and fruit candy before leafy hops attempt balance.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the dark red.
-Hops also contribute spiciness in the finish.
-There is something within that simply doesnt work for me, creating nearly off flavors.
-Bready limpness adds to the confusion.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

3707,"2012-09-09",3.6,"This was a nice one. Aroma of big caramel malt with some light grassy hop in the background. Taste follows, making this one very malt heavy with a ton of caramel, but a hop balance to bring the flavors together nicely. Awesome!","Florida, USA","OmegaX"

3707,"2012-06-03",3.2,"Tap at Funky Buddha. It pours cloudy deep red, with a large beige head. The nose is dark fruit, leather and chocolate. The taste is caramel, red fruit, wood, leather, milk chocolate and spice, with some dryness in the finish. Medium body and prickly carbonation. Not bad, but nothing special.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

3707,"2012-05-04",3.0,"Draft at brewpub. Murky red brown. Thin cap. Aroma has fruity malt, the palate is slick and thin. The flavors are also very fruity (orchard fruit), and has an old world feel to it. The flattish palate makes it seem like a cask pour.

3707,"2012-03-20",3.6,"I had hoped for more excitement in this beer, but it did not yield anything particularly mind blowing. It was a decent beer for the most part, just not a memorable beer. It was a little nutty in flavor, but pretty subtle for the most part. There was a bit of carmel in this, but not enough to really jump out at you.","Florida, USA","pari6819"

3707,"2011-11-12",3.4,"The Red Dawn is a decent Red Ale. It pours a nice deep red color with a hefty head. The initial aroma is that it will be very malty with heavy roasted nuts. The actual taste doesnt deliver quite the nuttiness that seems to be in the aroma. It has a slight watery taste and leaves you wanting something more. Overall though it was good.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"

3707,"2011-10-25",2.9,"Draft at Funky Buddha.  Deep unfiltered amber brown.  Massive head, partially just a bad pour.  Soapy red, not so impressive.  Big amber malt flavor,,,woody sugary cherries.  This really doesnt all come together if you ask me, sort of watery, and the minimal hops are covered up dont really meld well with the overbearing amber malt.  Like a homebrew Canadian Amber.  Unimpressive.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

3707,"2011-09-05",3.1,"Bottle, thanks to darkguardian. 
Clear, reddish brown pour, with a tan, two-finger high, creamy head.
Aroma of spices, caramel, nuts and quite a bit of butter. Even more butter in the taste, nuts, bready malts, grassy hops. Medium to full body, sweetish aftertaste, lively, almost aggresive carbonation. Somewhere in the background this feels like it could be a good beer, but the amounts of butter in aroma and taste is not all that pleasant. Dont know if that was intended?","Göteborg, SWEDEN","blomster"
3707,"2011-08-09",4.2,"On cask at the St. Pete Craft Beer Expo.  Pours slightly hazy amber with a small tan head.  Nose is lots of malt sweetness, caramel, slight toffee, and a bit of light fruit esters, and some nuts.  Flavor is similar with lots of malt and some esters and nuts.  Medium in body and smooth in mouthfeel.  This is an outstanding beer, and very sessionable; dangerously sessionable.  I could personally drink the hell out of this beer.  Not quite sure on the style of this one.  If its an Irish Red, then it ties with Brian Boru as my favorite Irish Red.  If its an amber, then it has more malt quality than most ambers, and is an outstanding amber.  Damn it, Funky Buddha, why are you so far from Tampa!?!","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

3707,"2010-10-18",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2010 Hand bottle  Pours brown and murky with a small, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. The nose is subdued and difficult to pull from my glass. Once I really dig in, theres a lot going on here, aroma-wise  very malty and nutty, but more fruity and vinous than anything  esters, I assume. For a fairly low ABV beer, this one is very full-bodied and creamy. Interwoven, tickling carbonation. Im picking up some dark cherry, dark port (minus the sweetness) and Russian black bread. Minerally, black cherry finish that dries out a touch. Bottle courtesy of hankchinaski. Thanks Kevin!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3707,"2010-09-25",3.6,"On tap for the grand opening. Reading the name for this beer made me laugh a little because the early 80s movie Red Dawn is so damn funny to me now when I watch it. But this beer is more on the serious side. The color is a little on the dark side and the aroma is somewhat fruity and malty. With 7 different malts in the blend I would tend to think that this would be a little more sweet then it is, but it was actually very enjoyable.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
3707,"2010-09-10",3.9,"Pours a almost mahogany color, quite clear and really a nice color. Nose is really wild. Extremely fruity, but there was no fruit added or hops used that would impart this, best guess is that it was the honey malt used. The fruitiness has no hint of sourness and you get some rich caramel notes as well. Flavor is perfect for a malty amber or irish red. With hints of nut and toast balanced by caramel sweetness. Light bitterness is all about all you get from that side of things at the end. Yet its not overly sweet. I really liked this one, I think its will do very well for them. Thanks to Kevin for letting me try this one.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
