A bit of leafy, lightly herbal hop notes, perhaps, as well. Pretty light, low aromatics but no alcohol or flaw and nothing aggressive or out-of-style here.Same goes for the mild, very drinkable, gently-hopped flavor. Dry and well-attenuated with a very soft, lightly watery texture showing light chocolate, vegetal and peppery hops adding gentle bitterness and just a touch of cream and light caramel on the finish.

4375,"2012-12-19",3.9,"On tap at Toronado. 
Aroma is all malt. Light roast and chocolate along with some burnt toast and cracker with a hint of caramel. No diacetyl but there are low esters. Low hop aroma as well. No alcohol. 
Appearance is dark brown to black with a thin light tan head that recedes to the edges. 
Flavor is malty sweet with a decent amount of roast an secondary notes of chocolate, burnt toast, a good amount of cracker, and light caramel. Moderate noble hop flavor; some floral spiciness. No diacetyl and a touch of fruity esters, but I could be confusing the eaters with the hops. Hop bitterness is moderate and alcohol notes are not present. 
Mouthfeel is crisp and light as a lager should be. Medium high carbonation. Low astringency in the finish. Low to medium alcohol heat. 
Overall I really like this beer. It's an easy drinking dark lager with more character than the Full Sail Dark Session Lager. The hop flavor is perhaps a bit too pronounced.

Finally a chance not only to taste more American Dark Lager (a rather obscure genre in Europe), but the best of the genre according to Ratebeer. Two good reasons to get my hands on this one. :-) Pours a pitch black body with a huge creamy beige head; a very impressive sight. Aroma is filtered (pot) coffee, dark malts and hints of tar. Taste has more coffee, but this time it reminds me of the powdered/freeze-dried variant instead - like instant Nescafe. There are also hints of leather and milk chocolate in there.

4375,"2010-06-28",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2010 My Bottom Line:
Chocolatey malt and a roasted finish are supported by wooden hops and their citrusy edges in this stoutish, well-structured Schwarzbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam lingers on the dark brown opacity. 
-One of the two pints I had (at the Hopmonk Tavern, not at Toronado) had a nose which was all iodine. Hard to really get worked up on whats in your glass when the aroma is this problematic. Thankfully, this problem seemed to slowly evaporate with time, and wasnt present at all in the pint I had at Toronado.
-The mouthfeel is crisp even though chocolate malt flavours are salient. 
-Effervescence is loose, increasing drinkability. 
-There is a nice balance between the few sugars and the quiet bitterness.
-The body on this one is richer than any authentic Schwarzbier Ive had.

Having had it again today, I can say that this is a nice fairly rich, but still light bodied beer resembling a more full-bodied, tastier dry stout.  It is black with a big, dense, brown head that lasts and leaves excellent, rich, even rings of lacing.  The aroma is rich, dark toasted malt, nuts, molasses, caramel, and a hint of chocolate.  The taste is similar, but without the caramel and with a strongly toasted malt emphasis, hints of chocolate and coffee, burnt toast, with initial sweetness balanced by a zesty, spciy bitterness.  It has a long, mellow finish and is satisfying, smooth and fairly light while having fairly full body and flavor.  It is not especially complex, though, and is ultimately fairly straightforward.","California, USA","Wulfstan"

Starts out somewhat sweet with flavors of chocolate and nutty molasses.  This dries up mid-palate with some roast coffee bitterness.  An almost undetectable trace of butterscotch suggests diacetyl, but is very minor if there.  Lots of herbal, minty hops round out the finish nicely.

4375,"2005-11-30",4.1,"On tap, Zeitgeist. Black, but light body, small white head.  Light mouthfeel.  Huge roasted coffee aroma.  Really balanced roast taste all over a lager body.  Wow, this is just about the best example of this style I have ever had.  Excellent.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
4375,"2005-09-18",3.7,"(draft, Toronado) Black body with tan head that leaves nice lacing.  Aroma is moderately sweet, coffee, chocolate.  Taste is moderately sweet, coffee, lactose, light cocoa, some grapefruit underneath.  Creamy medium body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
4375,"2005-09-03",3.6,"(Draft: Liars Club in San Diego, CA) In a word, roasty!  The nose is strongly roasty, with some chocolate and coffee, and minimally sweet.  And accordingly, the flavor is also strongly roasty with lots of cofee.  Its smoky, chocolaty, and has some corn/grain flavor, but its minimally sweet.  The roast and hops lend a moderate bitterness.  Medium bodied and dry on the palate.  The beer pours such a dark brown, its as close to being black as you can get without being black.  The tan head rises to half an inch in height after the pour, and settles to a thin film, but succeeds in leaving a dense curtain of lace on the glass.  Very nice beer.  Hopefully Ill see more beers from Moonlight down here in San Diego.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
4375,"2005-08-22",3.5,"Dark. roasty, but as the brewer demands, not a schwartzbier. Nor porter nor stout. A unique creation that manages to blend well the dark tones with some sharp hop bitterness. The only thing reminiscent of a schwartz is the color and something of a watery texture. Realy enjoyed as I did all their other beers and will look forward trying again.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
4375,"2005-07-07",3.4,"Very dark, with chocolate and herb taste. Strong smoky taste. A little on the bitter side, but very flavorful.","San Francisco, California, USA","kaottic97"

4375,"2005-03-22",3.8,"An oily pour with just a mark of head. Rich, dark chocolate and burnt hazelnuts, espresso and no bullshit. This is a well crafted lager.","The Big Apple, USA","carlitos99"
4375,"2005-03-10",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2009    Huge complex LAGER, that has changed many minds about lagers. Burnt cocoa and rich honey and molasses notes. Lite smoke at first that leaves very quickly.  Mocha and lite hop finish clean and relatively dry. great beer.","manteca, California, USA","aspidites"
4375,"2004-10-18",2.6,"Pitch black coloured body with absolutely no head. Aroma of burnt malt, some caramel and a bit of overroasted coffee. Not the best aroma around, thats for sure. Medium-bodied; Burnt malt flavour with a smoky nuance behind. Aftertaste bittered by all the flavours-no sweetness at all! Overall, great to try, but lacking in so many dimensions! I sampled this pint from draught at Toronado in San Francisco, California on the second day of 10-June-2004...our first was spent in Sydney, Australia.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

4375,"2004-06-25",3.8,"Black body, minimal ring of white foam crowning glass. Smells of espresso beans and coffee. Taste is more bitter than sweet with a comfortable hop force. Coffee, roasted dark and lovely, gently wrapped in mocha. Aftertaste is drying and bitter hops, almost IPAish. Sampled on draught at Toronado in San Francisco, CA.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"
4375,"2004-06-10",3.6,"On draught at Toronado.  05.22.04  Pours black and thick looking.  Smells like a smoked out campfire in the morning over burnt coffee.  All charred malts and minimal head.  Chewy but thin texture.  I didnt realize this was a schwarz until just now and my impression makes much more sense.  Probably my favorite of the style so far.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
4375,"2004-05-14",3.2,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2004 Tap, Toronado, San Francisco. A pretty unique dark lager. Mashy/oaty, quite ashy and salty, pretty big hit of hops and bitterness. Pretty tasty, but a little unbalanced.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"

4375,"2001-08-24",4.7,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2014 This is a richly complex beer, tried on a lark on tap at Amnesia SF. The aroma hit and immediately rang 9-plus. Tobacco, roasty malts, burnt paper, like a pencil burning in a speeding pencil sharpener. The color is black as pitch. Dry light body with Moms Folgers coffee flavors, minerals, and well integrated bitter. A very smooth, easy roast (near smoke) finish.  Would be excellent late night with a cigar. This is a great beer!","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
4375,"2001-08-09",4.5,"This was one yummy beer. I had no idea it was a lager until after I had finsished the beer. Tasted more like a silky smooth porter with a very nice roasted taste.","USA","BustaCap"
4375,"2001-08-05",4.4,"Woah, this one was a surprize!  The only American-brewed schwartzbier that Im aware of, this beer has a fantastically roasty flavor that would be the envy of any porter or stout.  Very smooth, since it is a lager, but waves of malt and hop complexity make it one of the most exciting pints Ive had in a while.  Magnificent.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
