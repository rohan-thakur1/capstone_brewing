2.75 A: Deep brown color. Just a thin skin of head formed during an aggressive pour and fell just as quickly as it formed.

4.0 S: The bourbon and barrel mix extremely well with the base beer. Big leathery component with molasses, melon, plum, raisin, and caramel. A touch of smokiness, a bit of roast, vanilla, oak.

3.0 M: Heavier medium body. Undercarbonated by about half of what Id want. Lightly creamy, which I imagine would be improved with more carbonation.

Smell is of burnt brown sugar, caramel malt and charred oak. As beer warms, bourbon becomes more apparent. Hops werent detected. 

Taste is definitely a malt bomb. Biscuit malts, caramelized sugar, and burnt oak dominate the palate. Bourbon is definitely in there but isnt too harsh for a 12 percent alcohol beer. 

Mouthfeel is medium heavy, carbonation is a tad on the low end. Head was present throughout the beer and added a nice amount of creaminess. 

Overall beer was good but malt and sweetness were overpowering. Would have liked something to distract from the cloying sweet malt, maybe more barrel aging?","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

Im drinking it NOW. Yay me!
The beer is opened and the malty fluid pours into a tulip as requested by the brewer. The aroma is dark caramel, peat smoke and wood; the scents melding warmly above the glass. The dark, ruby-amber beer is topped with a finger of khaki foam that thins to a deep ring at the glass and forms a sheet across the surface. A deep inhalation draws the brew to life, and as I bring the glass to drink, the heady sweetness causes my eyes to close. Surely the lack of one sense will allow me to better experience the depth of the others! I tip the glass to pull the brew over my tongue and find a dry bite at the tip of it, though not from the heat of the beer. This isnt boozy, in fact, quite the opposite; Im experiencing the sweetness of malt and burnt sugar tempered with bourbon...very nice! The cool brew is sticky on my lips, a luscious liquid exhibiting intoxicating aromas. Ive come to love this style because of the thick, sultry way it warms, the way it slips over your tongue and down your throat before you realize that it was even there, and then its gone, and you want more! The Wulver Im experiencing is savage in sweetness, but this is tamed by the age, by the bourbon accents. The finish is long on it because of that stickiness, but the flavor is consistent, so I dont mind. This is a really nice beer. I should have bought two. Maybe three. If it was local, Id always have a bottle on hand. No doubt.","USA","lightbias"

I should have saved this for a blind RB BA scotch ale tasting, but, you know, football. At any rate, glad to have the full bottle to myself. The first couple of ounces I would have given this a 3.8, but by ounces 4-6 this has opened up nicely. The flavor lingers so nicely. I admit Im a sucker for strong sweet dark beers, and this presses that button real nice, but crafted so well that I dont even feel guilty giving it a high score.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

661,"2014-11-12",4.9,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.

A: Pours into the glass a cloudy, opaque deep hickory brown, and forms a nice pale head that slowly settles into a thick cap and ring. Shining light through the beer reveals a ruby-red cloudiness, and some bubbles slowly rising.

S: Heady caramel and toffee toast malts, twined around a boozy, warm hardwood and vanilla waft out of the glass. The scent is plenty sweet, and contains little surprises here and there, like a tiny touch of anise or a bit of raisin.

T: That is a smooth, smooth barrel-aged wee heavy. Sweet as can be, caramel and toffee and fresh dark bread, all aglow with the warmth of oaky bourbon. Vanilla and raisin play along the edges of the flavor profile, along with some faint shadows of leather and figs. The finish is a quick blast of bourbon, followed by a lingering caramel-toffee sweetness tinged with vanilla. Alcohol heat settles in the belly, not in the mouth.

M: Since ""perfect"" is not actually all that descriptive, Ill try to be a little more detailed. This is a full, rich, creamy-smooth beer, the sort that feels like you can fold it with your tongue. It clings to the teeth and tongue rather well, and has just the right amount of carbonation for me not to notice it at all without the beer feeling flat.

O: This may be the single best execution of an aged wee heavy I have ever had, including the Founders Backwoods Bastard. Incredibly easy to drink, allows the malty sweetness to star with the bourbon barrel as the supporting cast, hides the ABV well - this is a really well done beer.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Luckily its not as poignant on the palate. Not sure how or why, but Im not complaining. Burnt brown sugars, caramel, dates, light cocoa powder, rich oak slabs, reminders of vanilla, smooth(er) whiskey warmth. The booze is, of course, very noticeable, but not unmanageable, though it does gain some steam as the beer warms up. Sticky, pretty thick body, what youd expect from a Scotch ale.

661,"2014-02-01",2.2,"Sampled from a bottle, 
this beer had a dark brown and red pour (it was a dark red with a bunch of particles when I held the glass up to a light) and it gave a one finger light tan head that receded to a thin layer with a thick ring, it left spots and fingers of lacing on the sides of the glass, 

the nose had aromas of bourbon and vanilla out front, some caramel, there was a lot of bourbon liquor sweetness, there was very little malt, 
the bourbon was prominent on the nose and I could not smell much else, after the beer warmed up a bit, the malt was a little stronger, but the bourbon still was in the way of enjoying the malt notes on the nose, 

the flavors were bourbon liquor and vanilla with little malt flavor, a little caramel, there was a lot of bourbon sweetness, 
the finish had some alcohol that dried the mouth from the bourbon in this beer, 

the mouth feel was about medium, it felt a little thinner than what I expected for a scotch beer, it was a little creamy and had soft to average carbonation,

this drink had too much bourbon that got in the way of enjoying the malty notes of a scotch beer, this was unfortunate, I was hoping to enjoy a Scotch Ale and instead got a bourbon drink with little beer aroma and flavor, this beer had way too much bourbon, if you love bourbon and do not care about enjoying a nice scotch beer, buy this beer, but if you enjoy a scotch beer and like a touch of bourbon along side the malty notes stay way from his beer, this beer was disappointing.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

661,"2013-09-24",3.7,"My Bottom Line :  
Vanilla, aniseed and fruit jam are laced in alcohol warmth in this silky and surprisingly elegant Barrel-Aged Scotch Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A ring of foam crowns the shiny dark amber.
-The nose is a tad linear (all bourbon).
-The residual sugar level is kept in check. This is rich, but nowhere near as obese as some big Scotch Ales tend to be.
-The chosen malts and bourbon barrels are perfectly harmonious.
-This is one of those rare beers that works best around room temperature. All flavors just become perfectly cohesive.

661,"2012-07-14",3.9,"Draft. Poured a hazy dark brown color with a moderate to large frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Medium to heavy toasted malt, wood and earthy bourbon aroma. Medium to full body with a creamy smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bourbon sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. A smooth complex drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
661,"2012-07-06",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2013 Sampled on tap. Clear red / brown color. Good even off-white head. Full-coverage lace. Really sweet barrel-woody taste. Woody aroma, lots of caramel. Very light carbonation, big body. Maybe not the best choice in this very hot environment. Decent, but not my thing.. too sweet 6/4/5/3/12 Re-rate, 7/15/13: 12oz bottle, shared by Dan H. So, so much more tasty and complex this time around. Fantastic nose. Vanilla, butterscotch, some marzipan. Plum, toasted coconut. Bit of chocolate. Clear red orange color. Minimal light khaki head. Couple loose dots of lace. Good, moderate sweet taste, lightly spicy, tasty alcohol warmth. No cloy, no alcohol burn. Very nice long aftertaste to savor the complex aroma. Bit of burnt sugar, little brown sugar. Bigger body, very light carbonation. Smooth, creamy texture. Excellent stuff. Tastiest, most complex scotch ale I think Ive ever had.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
661,"2012-06-26",4.0,"Poured on draft. Appearance is dark ruby to brown with a thin beige head of foam. Not much retention. Aroma is light oaky vanilla, woody, barrel notes with a nice showing of the peaty earthy leathery notes of the base beer. Lots of peat and earthy notes are coming through in this one. Taste is initially full on bourbon, but it really becomes a nicely delicate flavor that allows the base beer to shine. I like how Thirsty Dog is doing their barrel aging program, making the heat of the spirits more of a secondary flavor than an in your face flavor.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
661,"2012-04-05",3.8,"Beautiful caramel color, silky smooth. aroma of oak and vanilla, alcohol is present as it should be with the style. Really nice, I'm not a wee heavy fan but this is really nice.

661,"2012-03-17",4.2,"Growler This beer rocks! Pours deep, dark and clear with a mahogany sparkle when held up to light. The aromatic high-points are singed caramel, vanilla, a splash of bourbon and a hint of acidity. Full-bodied and silky with soft carbonation. The flavor leans sweet, but is well-balanced overall. Nice caramel, vanilla and bourbon components. Lengthy, bittersweet finish. Thanks to Elliesbrown for shipping this growler of world class beer to me!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

661,"2011-12-09",3.8,"On tap at Thirsty Dog.  Pours dark brown with brown sugar head.  Aroma is burnt brown sugar, wood, oak, vanilla, bourbon, and alcohol fusel.  Mouthfeel is tingly from a touch of carbonation and alcohol.  Flavors pretty much follow the nose with some raisins and dark fruit sneaking in.  Its pretty hot.  Overall a vanilla and bourbon bomb to be exact.  I dig it.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
