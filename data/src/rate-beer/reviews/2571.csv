2571,"2016-11-08",3.9,"Deep clear dark Amber under a foamy big light tan head. Smoky aroma thats also sweet and fruity with subtle cherry and currant and caramalty booze. Big bold flavor thats smokey with tones of sausage and whatnot but also semi fruity and semisweet with Barleywine esque tones of fruit, berries, definite booze and caramalt. Interesting.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

2571,"2016-08-08",3.6,"Bottle in trade from blutt59, thanks again!
Pours a slightly hazy deep brown color with a small off white head that slowly recedes. Rich caramel and toffee with hints of smoke and licorice. The flavor is more of the smoke than the caramel with a bit of dark fruitiness in there as well. Initially I thought the smoke was a bit to pronounced, but it kind of grew on me. Pretty nice sipper.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
2571,"2016-07-29",3.8,"Beer description starts off with "" complex"" that about sums it up. Aroma has smoky, peat malts with some medicinal qualities, as it warms a touch of fruitiness and chocolate comes in. The body looks like flat cola, some yeast floaters, the head is thin and clinging to the side of the glass. The flavor is all over the place smoky, peaty, fruity, caramel, booze. Overall an interesting beer for sure.","Texas, USA","BeerRenter76"

2571,"2016-05-20",2.9,"22 oz. bottle served in shaker- poured a somewhat transparent when held to a light source dark brown with light maroon tinting in it. One finger tan head formed but absolutely refused to lace upon the vessel. Aroma of light smoke, caramel, black tea, and wet paperboard. Hits the mouth with a medium body, malt tastes like it was heavily toasted with some liquid smoke added to it, middle holds up well, finish is slightly sweet with a cloying kind of sensation with a leather overtone. Another brewery payment for them, another sucker tick for me.","Austin, Texas, USA","mmmbeer"
2571,"2016-05-13",3.9,"Mahogany in color, flimsy, unstable beige head. Fresh malt aroma, some cardboard, sweet tea, tobacco. Excellent on the tongue, crisp yet mellow, breathy on the finish....boozy but not 10% boozy. Sweet wood, caramel, mint.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"

2571,"2016-04-26",4.6,"Saint Arnold Divine Reserve 16 has a thinnish, cream-colored head, a dark, orange-brown appearance, and sheet lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is of rich, malt, brown bread, brown bread crust, and even brown bread dough. There is an acidic plum note, as well. Taste is of peat smoke, but not to the rauchbier level, with nougat, brown bread crust, plum skin, acidity, caramel, toffee, and relatively low hop bitterness, although it is detected. Mouthfeel is high-medium/low-heavy and slick, and Saint Arnold Divine Reserve 16 finishes on the dry side. RJT","Laplace, Louisiana, USA","ronaldtheriot"

2571,"2016-04-19",3.8,"Bomber. Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Nose has a faint smoke aroma and a slight yeasty roast smell. Taste is the same with a slight caramel sweetness. Just a faint smoke flavor-which is good because Im not a big rauchbier fan. Nice carbonation and a silky smoothness. Nice drinker.","Seattle still not near Beersel., Washington, USA","bleeng"
2571,"2016-04-02",1.8,"Smokey dark fruit. Pours a dark root beer color with a thin off white head that leaves a film on the glass. The smoke is there but not overpowering. Still more than I like. Other than that its sweet and smooth with some dark fruit flavors. Just a hint of hops edge on the finish. If it wasnt for the smoke it would be a decent beer.","","sjohnny"
2571,"2016-04-01",3.4,"Unique smoky and salty aroma. Smells like barbecue brisket. Interesting light brown color with a light tan head of foam. Tastes salty with light smoke, roasted malt and a slightly hoppy yet oddly refreshing aftertaste. This one is hard to define. I wouldn't seek this one out again but I am glad I tried it.
