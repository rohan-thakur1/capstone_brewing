The aroma has rich chocolate cake, sweet coconut and vanilla barrel notes, and a warm boozy character. Sweet and rich. Big body with moderate carbonation and a slick mouthfeel.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

1791,"2016-06-17",4.2,"Location: 16 oz can purchased at tap room
Appearance: Dark black brown. Decent head of small mocha bubbles. 
Nose: Rich roast malt. Earthy. Herbal. Leather. coffee
Taste: Burnt sugar, tobacco, caramel, bittersweet chocolate. Vanilla.
Body: Full and creamy. Very big mouthfeel.
Parting thoughts: A very impressive imperal porter. Costly. Only seen at the taproom in cans. Worth the time and effort to find.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
1791,"2016-05-12",4.1,"This beer is a brown-black color with a medium beige head that diminishes steadily to an outer ring. Patchy lacing on the glass. Aroma of roast malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Medium to full body with flavors of roast malt, earthy coffee, dark chocolate and brine. The finish is malty with a fudge and coffee aftertaste. Good beer all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1791,"2016-04-30",4.1,"Thanks to Steve for this gem. 16oz can chugged in about 12 seconds. Sorry, phallusU, but this beer is above a 4.0. Its not trying to be an imperial stout or Porter, but a Baltic Porter. Showcasing notes of tobacco, dark fruit and cigarette butts that youd find on the floor of an Eastern European factory, this beer hits all the notes for the style. Thin mouthfeel. Very true to style. I like this. 
Possibly the best beer ever made in Ohio.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"
1791,"2016-04-23",4.2,"Poured from a 16oz can to a teku glass. Jet black, with a tan, small head. Lots of lacing left on the glass. Aroma of coffee, dark malts, doughy bread, vanilla, and chocolate. Taste is sweet chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, and bread, with slight bitterness. Medium body. Zero detection of alcohol. Have had a couple of beers from this somewhat local brewery, and was not too impressed - however this beer delivers. Highly recommend to others.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","michcam8"
1791,"2016-03-26",4.3,"16 ounce can, canned on 01/13/16. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head. The head stays around for a long time, and theres a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and some berries. The taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some burnt/charred malt and caramel noticeable, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I think its a pretty good Baltic Porter, hopefully Warped Wing will make this again. Ill have to pick up some more while I can! $7.59 a single can, the 2-pack sells for $14.99.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
1791,"2016-02-28",3.9,"Draft at the Brass Tap - U Square, served in a flight. Pours a deep opaque brown with amber highlights in the slimmest part of the glass and a small dark tan head that settles into a ring and an island of film while also leaving trailing lace in the glass. Notes of roasted malts, with burnt sugar, dark chocolate, fudge, tobacco, caramel, and honey. Full-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, gritty, roasty, rich mouthfeel. Big beer. I feel like a chump rating it under 4.0 for the first time ever, but thats how it hit me. Looking forward to a barrel aged version of this, perhaps.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1791,"2015-07-28",4.2,"APPEARANCE - perfectly black with nice brown head. 
NOSE - surprisingly little. 
FLAVOR - Im surprised they can get such depth with a porter. Tastes almost like a stout and has the palette of one too. Rich and complex flavors in the end of the sip. 
NOTES - thoroughly enjoyable.","Lee, Massachusetts, USA","bnokk"
1791,"2015-03-26",4.8,"On tap at Middletown Fine Wine and Spirits pint night. Pours black with a dark brown head. Aromas of coffee, roasty malt and alcohol. Taste the same with a prominent, alcohol heat. Some flavors of, caramel, chocolate, vanilla and a little, licorice. Medium to heavy mouth feel. Nice lacing in the glass. Very nice porter.","Trenton, Ohio, USA","arn8897"
1791,"2015-02-27",4.1,"Draft pour at Flipdaddys pours opaque dark brown to black with thin tan head. Nose light roast, some coffee, and milk chocolate. Taste wow, big flavors.

1791,"2015-02-07",4.1,"Draft at Dutchs tasters and a snifter. Pours dark brown to black in color with a small beige head. The aroma and flavor have big roasted malts (especially on the nose), dark chocolate, caramel, hints of coffee, warming alcohol that doesnt really show in the flavor, dry, a hint of vanilla cream, hard to distinguish this from an imperial stout, very good beer either way.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
1791,"2015-02-05",4.0,"Draft sample. Pours black color with an average to large frothy tan head that was lasting with excellent lacing. Medium to heavy toasted dark chocolate, coffee and dark fruit aroma. Medium to full body with a thick smooth texture and flat carbonation. Heavy toasted dark malt flavor with a medium to heavy dark sweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout porter.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1791,"2015-02-05",4.1,"On tap at Dutchs. Black color. nice thin tan head, leaving good thicker splotches of lace. Bigger body. Good chewiness, but not thick and viscous as some stouts can be. Light dry finish. Lighter carbonation, good crispness. Great big heavy roast malt character, some dark fruit, nice earthiness. Bigger bitterness, lighter to moderate sweet. Good dark chocolate, mild coffee. Very nice, long aftertaste. Awesome stuff to sip on overall. Tons of bigger flavor and character. Possibly the most bold and flavorful baltic porter Ive ever had.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1791,"2015-01-26",4.9,"Wow! Best beer yet from Warped Wing!!!! Now if they would barrel age this... nudge, nudge, wink, wink! One of THE best porters Ive ever had. Perfect in every way. By the way this very much an Imperial Baltic Porter.","Troy, Ohio, USA","brock1984"
1791,"2015-01-24",4.6,"Draft at the brewpub. Woah, mama. This is a beaut! Deep and dark, this was a welcome sight on a cold night. Full of mocha flavors and a hint of alcohol burn, this was simply delicious. My first and only Warped Wing beer (so far) was a hugely successful first impression!
