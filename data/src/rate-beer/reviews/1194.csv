1194,"2017-06-13",3.5,"Bottle 330ml (bottled 28.07.2016). Piwo delikatnie zmętnione o bursztynowej barwie z obfitą, biało-żółtawą pianą i przede wszystkim trwałą. Aromat słodki, wyraźnie słodowy, taki cukierkowy, nieco karmelowy z nutami owoców tropikalnych, żywicy, przyjemny choć wyraźnie słodowy a mniej chmielowy. W smaku też słodowość wiedzie prym, choć słodycz jest tylko delikatna, goryczka też niewielka i dochodzi do tego dość wyczuwalny alkohol. Fakt, że piwo najświeższe nie jest, prawie 11 miesięcy po zabutelkowaniu choć data ważności jest do końca roku (12.2017), to piwo z butów nie wyrywa, jest głównie słodowe z mała goryczką i nutką alkoholu. Na plus pijalność, bo piwo mimo 9 woltów jest dość lekkie w odbiorze ale po kilku łykach czuć rozgrzewanie od środka. Ogólnie przyzwoite piwo.","Wroclaw, POLAND","PabloZab"

1194,"2017-06-08",2.6,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2017 Bottled on: 2017-05-09, Price: $9.99 / 4 pack, 12 oz. brown glass bottle. 
Pours an orange-amber with short, off-white head. Bought solely based on the 100/99 rating; I wasnt impressed. 


Not the expected profile for an Imperial IPA. More malty than hoppy. Felt like Dogfish Head was trying to trick me; a double more sweet than it was bitter. 9% with very little alcohol presence.  A two-dimensional profile with little more to offer than sappy, caramel sweet and short-lasting bitterness.

APPEARANCE: medium amber orange, a bit cloudy, creamy off-white head, quite sticky. TASTE: smooth and kinda fruity upfront, followed by a burst of flavor and a fair amount of bitterness, can taste the alcohol but not in a bad way (seems in balance with the flavor and mouth feel ... Im guessing as this breaths a bit, it will get better), different flavor (hops?) than most typical IPAs, some caramel, dried fruits, pine, almost a liqueur taste to it, so it is sweet-sour-then dry-with residual sweetness under the tongue. PALATE: Full bodied, oily, complex, long bitter finish. OVERALL: A very good beer and a good IPA that does not only focus on hops. It is a well-rounded IPA with interesting sweet and sour notes, so some hardcore IPA fans may not rave over it. I like the complexity and interesting balance of unique flavors.

This is not like any of the beer back in my day. I suspect the new craze of extreme hops in beer has developed over time in that people who enjoy the hops bitter flavor needed increased amounts of hops to satisfy them. Like someone who tries a some mild hot wings and then graduates to medium, and then to very hot wings. I do not like strong hopped beer. I would not have tried to drink this if I had known, but I did learn this through my first extreme hopped beer experience. If you love this beer, good for you. Beer drinking is all about enjoyment.

1194,"2016-01-23",4.9,"This is the gold standard for beer. The 90 minute is exceptional and far superior to the 60 minute and also much better than the 120 minute. I guess its the perfect balance. The higher ABV can sneak up on you since the beer doesnt have the extra fullness feel of other high gravity brews. The color is a light bronze that is darker than other IPAs, but still in the amber-red family. The foam is an orange tan that gives a nice tickle when consumed. The initial taste is slightly bitter hops, yet remarkably smooth with just a hint of citrus and smoky wood, It rests in the mouth like a fine single malt scotch with an impeccable smoothness of perfectly balanced hops and malt with hints of golden raisin, candied orange peel, vanilla and caramel. The finish is what truly sets it apart from other IPAs. It has a touch a bitterness, but still leaves a smooth essence like sweet tobacco and refined hops. This is the beer to compare all others. While a few may be better or have more complex tastes like barrel aged and flavored porters, the list is very short.","HHI, South Carolina, USA","jeffreylee"

Definitely some clove-y belgian yeast mingling somewhere in it.  Not the best IIPA by far, but enough complexity to give a nod to. A bit too clingy and not enough cleanliness.

1194,"2016-01-19",4.5,"<>Kolor: Bursztynowy. Niebywała wręcz klarowność. To co wyróznia amerykańskie browary - ta niesamowita czystość piwo. Można dokładnie odczytać napisy i logo, które jest na drugiej stronie Hamburga.
Piana: Jasnożółta, drobna, średnio i drobnoziarnista.
Fenomenalna gęstość, puszystość i trwałość.
Piana jest wysoka i powolutku opada do grubego kilkucentymetrowego kołnierzyka.
Lacing wzorowy.
Nie ma tutaj słabych stron.
Zapach: Aromat od pierwszej sekundy zaznacza, że rzadzą tu amerykańskie chmiele.
Jest słodko, tropikalnie.
Przede wszystkim: mango, ananas, marakuja, papaja, karambola oraz lichi.
Słodowe, słodkie akcenty są daleko w tle z minimalnym stężeniem karmelu.
W drugim podejściu żywiczne nuty lasów tropikalnych. 
Smak: Po pierwszym łyku już wiem dokładnie wszystko o tym piwie.
Smak jest słodki, chwilami wręcz likierowaty.
Słodycz ta pochodzi wyłącznie od chmieli i tropikalnych owocowych akcentów.
Nie ma tu landrynkowej, karmelowej, maślnej cukierkowatosci.
Jest za to smak świeżo wyciskanego soku z mango, marakuji, papaji i luchi.
Piwo wydaje się napompowane tymi owocami. Sprawia wrażenie jakby wyżej wymienione składniki były przepuszczone przez Randala.
Na drugim biegunie mamy aromatyczne sosnowe, żywiczne niuanse.
Niebywałe jest to, że przy 9% alkoholu i 90 IBU odczucie w ustach jest wciąż lekkie i gładkie.
Pijesz Double IPA, a wydaje Ci się, że to lekkie, sesyjne APA.
Goryczka jest wysoka, ale krótka, stylowa, w ogóle nie przeszkadza. 
Piwo jest kompletne w każdym calu. 
Wysycenie: Niskie.
Podsumowanie: 

90 Minute Imerial IPA - nazwa nawiązuje do CIĄGŁEGO dodawania chmieli przez 90 minut gotowania!
Swoisty majstersztyk!

Bardzo popularny w USA magazyn dla mężczyzn ""Esquire Magazine"" nazwał to piwo Najlepszym IPA w Ameryce.

Podpisuje się pod tym rankingiem.
Była to dla mnie wycieczka do świata piwnej rozkoszy.
Doznania smakowe były nieograniczone.
Piwo jest wybitne.
Jedno z najlepszych IPA jakie piłem w życiu.
Kompletne smakowo w każdym detalu.

Buteleczkę przywiozła mi koleżanka z Nowego Jorku.
Jest to świeżutka warka, dlatego też walory smakowe są spotęgowane.

Wiem na pewno, że zrobię wszystko, żeby ktoś przywiózł mi z USA - 120

1194,"2015-08-25",4.1,"9% ABV. Imperial IPA.

Poured of the bottle a deep rich amber, 16-18ºSRM.

Nose was full of fresh roasted malty flavors. Sweet but not cloying. Not much in the nose to suggest that this is an IPA.

Heavy soapy, syrupy mouthfeel, this is an homage to the very best quality barley malt that started this whole brew. All that sugar contributed to the robustly alcoholic palate that is gradually scrubbed off by progressively bitter herbaceous and eventually almost bright citrus hops. Finishes with a palate that is like sweet tangerine peel. Sweet and bitter at the same time, like getting French-kissed and then bitten on the lip. Perfectly balanced. Again, the fact that this is an IPA slowly reveals itself in a most engagingly intriguing and painfully teasing fashion. A artfully choreographed brewing striptease.

A wondrous effort by the fine folks at Doghead Fish.

Its like the last two thirds of a ""normal IPA"", with the caramel malt and bitter finish, but no fruit bomb at the start. Its malty enough to be a Belgian strong ale, but without the spicy yeast.

You can definitely taste the amber/caramel malt flavors at the start and middle of the sip before it gives way to a little bit more of the citrusy tendencies of a traditional imperial IPA. Feels like a heavy mouthfeel with an oily/syrupy lean. The alcohol doesnt shy away from making its presence felt.

1194,"2015-07-23",3.8,"355 ml bottle bought at Q-Club in SoHo, Central.
Looks: Clear amber honey colour; One-quarter finger head and residual soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with quite fizzy small carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant, oozing and very sweet Ale malt, with fruit cakes, raisins, light brandy, floral, quite strong liquor-ish alcohol, strong sugar, pine, strong resin, Yeast, lime cordial and grass.

Taste: Medium sweet, very rich Amber Ale malt, with very light caramel, very light grapefruit, raisins, light brandy, quite strong alcohol, syrup, strong pine, very strong resin, biscuits, yeast, strong lime, moderate to strong bitter hops and quite sharp grass.

Body: Full body. Thick and very oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: A simple-minded amber malty bomb! Rich to the core in a thick and somewhat oily background. Tastes match as much as the aroma with strong and sweet brandied fruitcakes, very strong ooze but pine is not that strong. Syrupy and oozy turned the limey hops into cordial, but manages to be pretty comfy all along. Quite amazing!

Hoppiness: Very strong fruit cakes soaked in light brandy, raisins, lime, pine and strong resin in both nose and taste.

Bitterness: the 90 IBUs seems pretty low-fi compares to most German Pils at even lower bitterness level. Still a good lasting, quite strong astringent sweet malty finish.
 
After Taste: Fairly dry. Sweet-oozy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is a fairly hard-hitting IIPA, walked in a rather simple direction to give you a knock without being too bashful. The brandy liquor background is tamer than many strong Belgian ales, and the resiny ooze does not go overboard, which I like, and while the hoppiness is simple, the overall result is comfy and enjoyable, small sips at a time of course.

1194,"2015-05-30",3.4,"Pours pretty amber-orange, initially hazy with effervescence but quickly clears, and modest off-white head that reduces to skim.
Big pine aroma with whiff of citrus and brown sugar. Even bigger, rougher palate with candied mango and grapefruit, biscuit, fortified wine, vanilla and cleaning solvents, like a PineSol fruitcake.
The disparate tastes seem like Thomas Pynchons spoofs of English candy in ""Gravitys Rainbow:"" salted plum, gin marshmallow, camphor nougat, sweet-and-sour eggplant. 
90 Minute goes past the usual over-hopped American IPA, with similarly large amounts of malt taking it into barleywine country, albeit a very evergreen type of barley. On the plus side, that puts it into better balance than a lot of rival products. 
And the 9 percent ABV, while substantial, is quite reasonable for a barleywine. Still, you probably dont want to be operating your backhoe while drinking this.
In short, a prime example of the more is not enough school of American brewing, throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. Completely unsophisticated, but true to the wackiness that is Dogfish Head.","","Pumpkin87"

1194,"2015-01-22",4.2,"Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA was one of the first truly big IPA brews of the style and has earned its place in the proverbial Craft Beer Hall of Fame. Its radically different when compared to brews of the style today because its so well-balanced. In fact, it might even been too malty for its own good, as it seems to drink like an imperial amber ale. Regardless, its still quite delectable and easy to drink  no wonder its endured all these years.

I poured a 12oz bottle into the official Dogfish Head goblet. It was bottled on 10/2/14 and cost $3.99 ($0.33 per ounce).

Appearance: Beautiful copper hue; mostly clear with a slight haze; plenty of visible carbonation. Pours to a two-finger, white frothy head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: For a supposedly hoppy beer theres a strong malt presence in the nose. Sweet notes of caramel and brown sugar, plus flowers and pine needles.

Taste: This is an overtly malty IPA. Theres a lot of sweetness and its immediately recognizable. Toffee, caramel and other candy flavors lay the foundation for a hefty malt base. Though a highly-hopped beer at 90 IBUs, its actually not all that bitter (well, not aggressively so). Like a good East Coast-style hoppy brew, the bitterness is slightly dank with a taste of piney and floral hops. The alcohol appears on the back end, accentuating the malt character and imparting mild warmth. Theres a distinct taste akin to coffee right as it finishes; probably due to some specialty malt. This is a well-rounded beer to say the least and an enjoyable one due to its uniqueness. An oldie but a goodie.

Drinkability: This is the kind of beer that was probably a behemoth when it debuted (or to craft beer drinking newbies); yet it seems so pedestrian in its delivery. Definitely full-bodied, but the mouthfeel is not as intense or cloying or sticky as you might expect. Theres even slight crispness from the carbonation. At 9% ABV its not surprising to find the alcohol plays a role in providing some warmth, but its far from a fire-breather. Additionally, at 90 IBUs its not an enamel-scraper, either. There is some lingering bitterness, but its easily tolerable. This is the kind of beer that will pair perfectly with a meal that can match its robustness and balance.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
1194,"2015-01-18",4.4,"Malty and hoppy! Maybe one of the best imperial IPA from USA. The constant hopping process gave this beer an intense (but not hard) hop flavor. On my case I also noticed a spice finish. Try it!!","","gpcnogueira"
1194,"2015-01-18",2.2,"Copied from my BA review.

Bottle date: 07.23.14.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle on 09.15.14 into a beer can glass.

A: 1 finger head. See through gold/yellow. Can see bubbles rising to the top.

S: Honey, grapefruit, orange. The smell blends together. The flavors dont stand out much individually.

T: Honey, grapefruit, orange are most apparent. Hop resin is more subtle.

M: Seems like it has enough carbonation. Somewhat creamy.

O: This is a very complex IIPA. The flavors follow the nose in blending together, which adds to the complexity, but theyre muted. So muted, I forgot that this was an IIPA. It is definitely in the East Coast style for IPAs, which I dont usually enjoy. This one was simply ok for me. I thought that the 60 Minute was better and more hop forward, which I prefer. Maybe the hops died a little while sitting on the shelf, but I doubt it from what other reviewers have written. If you like a well-balanced IIPA, this one may be for you, but I didnt care for it.","","WABeerFiend"

Maltier and stickier than the usual ""west coast style"" that dominates this category (e.g., Green Flash, Stone, Russian River). I personally prefer the drier WC style but 90 minute just works, undeniably. Piney hops and caramel sweetness on the nose. Orange amber with a hint of red in appearance. In taste, a first sharp wave of hops, followed by a sweet, sticky, candied apple center, finished with a clean rush of more hops. A delicious treat to be savored at 9% abv.

Az a fajta sör, amelynél érezzük, hogy a kortyok mennyiségből adódó keret elégtelennek bizonyul majd egy átfogó jellemrajz elkészítéséhez, azonban az ebbéli tulajdonságából adódó izgalmak megteremtik a lehetőségét annak, hogy az alatt a pár perc alatt sikeresen adózzunk a mennyei élvezetek oltárán. Kirobbanó ízek tárháza, a komponensek igazi tűzijátéka szórakoztat minket percekig, anélkül, hogy bármely összetevőjét nyomasztóan dominánsnak éreznénk. Ha valamihez mindenképpen kötni szeretnénk, az ""imperial"" jelzőt ez esetben sokkal inkább az összbenyomás monumentalitása, az egész kompozíció fajsúlyos jellege, esetleg az alkoholfok mértéke, semmint a keserűség lehengerlő foka támasztja alá.","HUNGARY","adster"

1194,"2014-08-12",4.7,"A supremely complex and tasty beer that is both well balanced and (at 9%) powerful to boot. The aroma, while pleasant and rather floral/fruity, is not nearly as outstanding or fragrant as certain other ipas. Despite the somewhat demure aroma, this beer is bursting with flavor and is easily one of the best beers Ive ever tasted. Its strong, sweet malt backbone is complemented by a mildly bitter hop presence and subtle hints of raisin and caramel. It should also should be noted that this beer also provides a nice warming, almost spicy effect similar to that of harder alcohol .

1194,"2014-08-08",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2015 One of Dogfish Heads exemplary IPAs, fresh bottle from NYC, thanks Marie!  Rocky and frothy, very thick, dense, egg-white head leaving papery lacing on the glass, clear orangey amber colour with no visible sparkling.  Powerful aroma of pink grapefruit flesh, tangerine and mandarin, fresh pine resin, biscuit, papaja, gin, dry autumn leaves, some haemoglobin iron, bitter honey, dried flowers, cigarette tobacco, subtle earthy touch.  Clean sweetish onset of blood orange, mango and sourish red berries, finely tingling carbo, somewhat oily, full mouthfeel, lean body achieved by a fairly thick and creamy caramelly maltiness with a slight toasted edge blending in perfectly with a big, yet gentle hop finish, very aromatic, citrusy, a tad piney and very floral, providing sufficient bitterness deep down but allowing more than enough of the juicy malt sweetness to pass through.  A piney, herbal, spicy hop bitterness remains after swallowing along with persisting caramelly malt sweetness; the alcohol, though considerable, is very well hidden and only reveals itself as a warming glow in the throat without becoming wry or obnoxious at any point - thus leaving the tender love-making of the malts and the hops alone.  This beer has become a classic and should be viewed as such: there are a lot more extreme examples of DIPA out there, but this one achieves utter balance and technical perfection.  An ideal introduction to the double IPA style I reckon, regardless of whether the hype is justified or not.  The nobility of this beer, within a style which is somewhat infamous for being aggressive and uncompromising, makes me happy.  Im glad I got the chance to revisit this after many years!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

The aroma is actually quite malty with lots of toffee, butterscotch and caramel presenting, along with a touch of fruity resiny hops. It drinks similar, with the malt being most prominent (caramel and toffee again). Theres a big fruity sweetness there as well (peach, mandarin), along with a dash of honey. The bitterness is surprising subdued for a double, but lingers along with a touch of booze. The texture is a little syrupy and the carbonation is average. While I certainly wouldnt complain if someone served another one of these up to me, it doesnt quite live up to its rep for mine. Its a very enjoyable sipper but simply fails to stand out for me.

The aroma has always been powerful through sweet caramel malts combined with a super nice sweet bittersweet citrus to light piney hoppiness.
The taste has always been a super nice long bittersweet citrusy caramel flavoring. 
On the palate, this one sits about a medium on the body with a nice structured sessionability. I want to sip it but often find myself constantly picking up the glass.

1194,"2014-05-18",4.0,"Transfer from BA reviewed on 1-26-12 - 
Poured from bottle into tulip shaped glass

Appearance - A beautiful golden color with a small head upon pouring. The head fades not leaving much lacing.

Smell - A wonderfully sweet tropical fruit smell first meets the nose. Very unexpected but very pleasant. This then mixes beautifully with a piney and floral hop aroma. Very nice.

Taste - At first sweet malt and tropical fruit taste mixed with a mild floral hop flavor. The sweeter malt remains in flavor, but is soon overwhelmed by the hops which really step up their show, intensifying quite a bit with a burst of mostly piney and citrusy hop flavor.

Mouthfeel - A good body but a little on the think side actually. It is very drinkable however as its carbonation is spot on. The thinner body make this 9% a little too easy to drink (good and bad at the same time).

Overall - A very nice IPA it truly is. In my opinion a little over-hyped, but only a little. Definitely a good brew.","","Darkmagus82"
1194,"2014-05-17",3.7,"This poured one of the prettiest beers Ive ever seen. Dark golden amber with a soft white head that lasted quite a long while. The aroma was less hoppy and more malty than I would have liked, and that malt definitely punched its way through on my overall happiness with the beer. The palate was sticky and almost syrupy, and less bitter than other reviewers seem to find it. This should be ice cold when poured, unless you really enjoy a sweet malty backbone, because it definitely has that to the end!","USA","lightbias"

Aroma is earthy sweet caramel malt and floral hops with light citrus notes. Taste is similar: rich sweet caramel malt and bitter hops with pine and citrus. Definitely different from your standard west coast DIPA, this is much more malt driven with the hops more restrained. Funny, I used to think this was the best one around, now this doesnt stand out so much to me with all the amazing hop-driven DIPAs that dominate.

Delicious! Smooth and really diverse, with the malt body equally strong to the hops, while still not too heavy. Unique aromas for the style, like dried fruits and subtle wooden notes, that I like a lot. Outstanding, complex and characterful style example, that I also imagine to age very well because of the big malt body.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

Pleasant and mild aroma consisting mostly of hops and grass (maybe more floral than grassy) but I could pick up whiffs of citrus (orange mostly), and mild butter/caramel. It pours sparkling golden-orange with nice finger-width, slightly off-white, head consisting of evenly sized small bubbles. This pour had the benefit of a glass which must?ve had etching on the bottom - there was a constant stream of carbonation feeding the head, giving it a presence throughout the drink (New Holland High Gravity flute), and leaving a nice lacing around the glass by the end. Even in a plastic glass, the head retention is generous, creamy, and fluffy and has a lot of sheet lace. The taste is a balanced medium high, citrus bittersweet. It?s a nice, medium body, a bit sticky with a mild hop flavor lingering. The constant head gives it the benefit of being creamy and frothy throughout, but it doesn?t feel fizzy at all. Its a medium body, a bit sticky, thats creamy and thick but also smooth with flavors of bread toast, biscuit, and caramel with some citrus. There?s a reason Dogfish Head gets so much credit for their beers, and this is a shining example of how to make and Imperial IPA without over-doing any aspect of it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

The is a solid beer by all standards. The hops really come through but are not overpowering, and this lacks the strong bitterness that turns some away from ""hoppy"" beers.

1194,"2013-10-30",4.4,"FROM NOTES: July 1, 12
From a 12 ounce bottle into a DFH glass. 

A: Holy hops, Batman! The strong hop nose dominates, but there is some definite malty sweetness apparent. I almost smell some honey, but I could be imagining it..... 
A: Pours a semi-hazy deep golden brown color with a one finger head that retains and laces very well. Tons of carbonation constantly drifting up the glass.
T: Complex and interesting in a fantastic beer way! While dominant, the hop profile doesnt overpower like most Double IPAs, perhaps due to the malty sweetness that follows the initial hop bitterness. A faint alcohol burn precedes the hoppy, bitter finish. 
P: Sticky and chewy, maybe even oily. The taste camps on the palate establishing all of the flavor. While this is thicker than most, the hop profile demands that it be, lest it be unbalanced. 
O: While I am not a hop psycho, the overall flavor of this beer is excellent. I am not impressed with a DIPA that over-loads the hops without balance, and this beer offers that balance that should go with such a large DIPA hop profile.

I had previously tried the 60-minute IPA from Dogfish Head and it didnt really convince me as a thing Id love to drink, as I felt the hops were kind of overwhelming (though if you love hops that drink is probably great for you). However, I quite enjoyed the 90-minute IPA as I felt it much better balanced the hops by also mixing in a lot of barley, and it ended up one of the first IPAs to truly wow me and turn me from a skeptic of that style into a believer.

Strong pine hop aroma with some oily bits & lots of bitterness. Some floral notes, caramel and sweet malts with citrus too. Almost no alcohol is noticeable.

Bright amber with a 2cm, foamy head that holds great and leaves some good lacing on the glass.

Bitter pine hops, grapefruit, citrus with sweet malts & caramel. Alcohol is well hidden and beer is a bitter one but not overpowering.

Bitter and smooth with a medium to full body, great balance & alcohol is well hidden. Carbonation is perfect with a good citrus tang. Excellent stuff.

An outstanding beer from start to finish. It looked & smelled great but tasted pretty much perfect with a great mix of sweet caramel malts and bitter hops with the usual citrus and grapefruit flavours coming through as well.

Extremely hard to get outside of the US, I was lucky to have this bottle picked up for my by a friend at the Great British Beer Festival 2013 in London. Light ruby red body, thin yellowed head, aroma kicks off with healthy wet hops leading onto faint raisin aroma and alchohol notes, very sweet raisin and fruity cake taste, not too dissimilar from turkish delight alongside a very complex layered taste, sweet and syrupy in texture and flavour. This beer surprised me, I expected it to be much more hop focused, but it actually felt a lot more like a Belgian fruitbeer along the lines of Rochefort instead of that American double IPA I was expecting, however it is simply an amazing beer, playing a fusion between fruit beer and IPA.

Polished orange and copper under a pithy head that lasts as a nice layer with scattered bubbles on top. A small collar slightly crawls up the sides of my glass. Swirls with more bubbles and head.

Nose:
Peaches, apricots, mandarin oranges, mango, star fruit  all boozed, spiced, and caramelized. Green leaf aloe in the back. Caramelized melba and toast, just the crusts please. Spiciness in the middle with ginger, cumin, and curry. Fruit skins on the outside, juicy flesh on the inside.

Palate:
Bitterness of orange, peach, and star fruit skins in the back. More star fruit along with aloe in the middle  fresh and tropical. Greenness in the back and underneath  tropical fruit skins. Lips are sticky with pine sap, caramelized apples, honey, and hop resins. Love the juicy middle ripe with boozed mandarin oranges and mango. Candied ginger along the edges. Slight settling of warmth in my chest.

Final Thoughts:
Amazingly drinkable and complex all at the same time. Because the 90 Minute Imperial IPA from Dogfish Head is so readily accessible, it is easy to forget how damn good this beer really is. Of course I prefer mine on draft, but Ill take it either way. Delicious and an excellent standard bearer for the Imperial IPA category.

Higher than average weight as I imagine the grain bill is high but it doesnt make the beer feel too heavy. Good carbonation. The beauty of this is its balance.

1194,"2013-05-12",4.5,"Lendária Imperial IPA da Dogfish Head, considerada por muitos como a melhor IPA dos EUA! Cor âmbar, com boa formacao de espuma, com aroma herbáceo intenso e duradouro. No nariz, ainda se sente notas do malte, como pao e grãos. Na boca, desce com ótimo corpo, na frente liberando o dulçor da enorme quantidade de malte, equilibrando perfeitamente com o amargor do lúpulo que vem em seguida, Dry Hopped ao extremo. Uma porrada de amargor, muito bem balanceado! Notas de pao, manga, grapefruit, álcool. Final seco, alcoólico e amargo. Excelente breja!

Smell: Oh mama... so subtle, but so nice. Its a really nice hop smell. Honestly, I dont think the beer tastes much like it smells, but that really doesnt even matter with this one.

Taste/feel: Has to be the most interesting IPA Ive had up to this point. Its certainly loaded with hops, but it also has -- as the bottle puts it -- a ridiculous amount of barley. I absolutely love it. Its hop heavy up front and in the smell, but the malts come through on the finish. I love it. Theres also a bit of warmth as well, making this a perfect Autumn beer. The feel of this one bothers me a tad, though. The whole beer itself is legendary, but I almost feel this beer to be a bit too syrupy to have more than one in a sitting.

Taste: The flavor is strong varying from bready to moderately hoppy. Flavors of bread, raisins, earthy bitterness, and citrus come to mind.
Palate: Full bodied with soft carbonation.

S - Nice caramel malt with some floral pine and alcohol coming through. It kind of reminds me of Hobby Lobby.

T - Sweet buttery caramel malt with a slight fruity character. The hops are assertive and have a kind of a candy bittering. Oily pine and citrus comes through to even out the heavy malt.

M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation.

This is the 4th time Ive had this beer and the malt always surprises me. I always thought from looking at reviews that this would be all hop and little malt. This beer is quite balance with the malt presence almost having a slight edge over the hops presence. Although this time the beer seemed to be significantly less hoppy that the previous three. The first 2 ties the lacing was incredible. The last 2 werent that great. The bottle says 8/20/10 so it makes it less less than 2 months old. I dont know. Seems a little different every time.

1194,"2013-02-01",3.5,"12 oz bottle, consumed during a respite from crib training. Joyousness.

A: Copper penny color. Aggressive pour yields fluffy foam that falls into itself quite quickly. Lasts on the rim. 

N: Very sweet. A cornucopia of pineapple and mango as well as biscuits and honey. Floral components. Lots of toffee, and theres a heavy barley that shows up - like a mass produced lager. (Ironically.)

T: Sweet bitterness. More pineapple, mango, and toffee. Lots of vine, but not much earth. The pine is more of the nut than the cone. Biting crystalized sugars. Everything is intertwined but no one component stands out. 

M: Somewhat light for the style. Alcohol is well hidden. 

O: I have fond memories of this beer because its the one that got me into IPAs. That said, its the bridge between the former light lager types and the heavier styles, for which it might be unfairly maligned, but to a mature palate, it starts to lack when compared with the menagerie of options out there.

Taste is a dance of citrus fruits and some fruity esters, never cloying of course. Much like Sierra Nevada pale ale became my go to beer when I first got in the game, 90 Minute is my go to year round DIPA, always solid + readily available.

Head is absolutely fantastic, and the bubbles of lacing are everywhere consistently.  So far, living up to the hype - now, will the taste?  Full-bodied, sweet, creamy, smooth, hops coming in at the finish.  Full-flavored, and yet so SMOOTH!  Sweet malts and hops last full well after each sip.  Very close with Ruination, but I think I have to give this the edge overall - its a clear victor in aroma, and it compares equally, or almost equally, well in all the other facets.

1194,"2012-10-19",4.3,"I saw the blurb and I thought ""Mere puffery sprinkled liberally with bollocks."" and then I sampled:
Appears amber with a marshmallowy creamy white head that left good lace. I certainly did not expect the cake-like aromas that I got when I stuck my (sizeable) nose over the glass and snorted. Like sniffy sherry cask finished whisky along with mandarin, tangelo, cut spruce logs and green cones. Some fresh alcohols, but the predominance is toward glace citrus peel and all sorts of lovely rich dessert. The flavour was another leap altogether. Creamy oranges and green grasses matched with persistent sherbet carbonation and a silky body. It is unctuous and viscous and gives a good whack of bitterness. The finish is enduring and brings out fruit salad laced liberally with golden rum, lychee and creamy orange.
I loved everything about this beer except the emptiness of the bottle. Do I agree with the labelling? Not entirely as I think the Sauvignon Blanc comparison is off (I live near Marlborough and Sav is too light, too fresh). More like Viognier with its tropical fruit and nectarine, which is also present in the finish.

While I tend to prefer the mouth-feel similar to the 60 minute and Stones IPA when Im drinking this style of beer.  That aside, I cant think of anything else that remotely turns me off.  The first thing that struck me: malt and hops are so well balanced.  Citrus notes from the hops give way to raisins and a bit of caramel from the malt and then finishing with a clean, bitter hop flavor that doesnt linger too much.  This is phenomenal.  The flavors are so well rounded with just enough of that lingering hoppy bitterness to not be cloying.

Just a fuckin great IIPA. Drink it.


Draught at rattle n hum. Clear, pure amber colour with a dense, white cap. Solid lacing. Aroma is nutty/woody, caramel, with a subdued pine fragrance. Alright, not subdued. The aroma is like the pine sap shit that gets stuck on your fingers when you're a kid ""exploring in the trees"", and this annoying crap is on you so as a kid you need to smell the annoyance, cuz that's what will explain what it is all over your body now. But add to that, your fingers had the sugar from a lollipop dripped all over because you were a veracious fiend of candy consumption, where you slobbered all over the fuggin place. So. Your fingers are coated in the previous lollipop candy stickiness, followed by pine sap adventure. Then an old geezer didn't like your frolicking, so they spritzed you with a bottle of homemade citrus rind extract. What a shitty old fucker! But you never knew tgat later in life, you'd get to use that discipline to your advantage. So, that in mind as a kid, smell your fingers. That's this beer.

The taste is good.... LOL

1194,"2012-08-25",3.6,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. Seriously, I cant believe Ive never reviewed this one before.

A: Pours a tawny copper color with low clarity. The head not only has a nice texture and offwhite color, but it retains itself in nice fashion, settling down to less than a finger tall. Nice splotches of lacing are left on the glass.

S: Malty. Lots of caramel and toffee notes, with hints of darker fruits, spices, mint, and piny evergreen. It could almost pass for a barleywine at times.

T: Whats malty on the nose...is malty on the tongue. The hop profile only exists to lightly augment the malts, rather than rely on the malt to provide just enough balance beneath crushing waves of grapefruit and pine. Caramel, toffee, and even some milk chocolate provide the initial flavors, before giving way to a faint herbal, dark fruit, and pineapple finish. Gets a little boozy as it warms up.

Looking back on it, I never should have had Burton Baton before getting a chance to (finally) try this. Im finding myself missing some its complexities and drier tannic finish - if not its higher price tag - compared to this ($50 says that this beer was used in the making of Burton Baton), and just isnt that impressive in comparison. On its own merits, however, its still quite good.

M: Really thick and rich, to the point wheres its almost too heavy for the flavors being presented. It presents itself as a sipper rather than a steady drinker, basically, but cutting down the heft could go a long way to increasing its drinkability. Still, I love how creamy it feels on the palate.

O: Pretty enjoyable, all told. This is the DIPA Id use to wean hop haters onto the general style, but personally I want a little more pizzazz. It also doesnt seem to suffer from age like other IPAs do, and its available pretty much everywhere in my area. Recommended, but not my favorite DIPA by any stretch.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

1194,"2012-08-23",4.4,"I can't complain.. This beer is delicious and complex, with a great texture. Though I am unsure why it is called an Imperial IPA, as I get more sweet malt character, then dry hop character... Rich, toasty, malted bread notes and caramel, first hit the nose, with undertones of deep orange citrus. On the palate, the rich malt character continues, with a concentrated mix of sweet orange, caramel and mild, toasty character. A lingering finish of orange and caramel sticks in your mouth for minutes. This is not your classic ""West Coast"" style IPA.. Not that that is bad.. This is actually easier to drink then many of the over hopped versions, even though the palate is thicker and richer, and more full bodied then some IPA's... yet it's not at all sticky like some IPA's. This beer manages to be concentrated, without the heavy feeling of being concentrated.. Smooth, smooth, smooth..

Good amount of smooth and spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, pine, peach, mango, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit.  Fantastic balance of pronounced caramel and toasty malt sweetness, with smoothly bitter hop flavors; very good flavor complexity and balance as well.  Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a pretty creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA.  The English two row adds a nice unique dimension to the flavor profile; and it has a very smooth balance of hoppiness with the malt profile.  Highly enjoyable, and I am glad I was able to get this really fresh for this re-review after not having had this one for a couple years.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

1194,"2012-07-21",4.2,"Pours a clear golden color.  Aroma is a little pine, sweet malt, and alcohol.  The aroma is definitely not this beers strong point which is fine with me since taste is of the utmost importance.  Having said that, the taste is excellent and for some reason this one is extra tasty today (I have had many of these in the past).  I am going back and forth between this and a Sierra Nevada Torpedo and the one difference I really notice is the malt presence in the 90 minute.  My taste buds are somewhat hindered at the moment from other beers but this seems to have a very nice balance between hops and malt.  I really enjoy hops but the malt seems to be keeping the extreme bitterness under control in a thoroughly enjoyable way.  The body is medium and the finish is much less bitter than one would expect from a beer of this style.  I have a few of these left, and will revise this review if I think it is inaccurate, but as of right now this is one good beer.","Delaware, USA","GSH1976"

Other notes include honey, caramel, grapefruit, and pine. Thick and sticky mouthfeel and well carbonated, but easy on the palate despite the hop profile. This is attributed to the well infused malts.

A: Clear orange-tinged hue. Slight effervescence, decent sized head and lacing.

S: Malt, then hops, with very little grapefruit, citrus, pine, etc. I have always thought that this beer is too malt heavy and lacks the classic hop aromas I expect from a DIPA.

T: The beer tastes fine, I suppose, but I always find myself a little underwhelmed when drinking 90 minute IPA. The ""balance"" of malts and hops heavily favors the malt, and leaves me yearning for that big hop aroma and taste so indicative of the style. I really have to shift my paradigm when I drink 90 minute IPA, and think of it more as a big ale, rather than a DIPA.

M: Sticky and sweet, with a malty and bitter aftertaste.

D: A decent brew, and easy to come by.

Notes: This beer ages rather well, and becomes something completely different. I cellared a case of 90 minute IPA for two years. The beer developed a molasses, caramel sweetness, the hop profile drastically faded, and the beer basically turned into an American Strong Ale. Interesting, if nothing else.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Clear, sparkling orangish amber with a very fine, creamy head and excellent lacing. 

Aroma of floral hops with some pine and citrus hops and a touch of sweet caramel malt. 

Taste of floral, pine and citrus hops neatly balanced by sweet caramel malt flavors. 

Medium body and above average carbonation. 

A very good beer, but I enjoyed the bottle version much better.  Maybe my senses were a little off that day, but I felt that all four beers I tasted at the Bungalow Alehouse were less aromatic and flavorable than I remembered from previously.

This one definitely represent the concept that a non-hop bomb DIPA isnt necessarily a boring caramel mash. On the contrary, even in the aroma 90 minutes has something different from other DIPAs. Sweetness is gentle, from raisins to plum, with a good citrus and tropical fruits components, both not strong. Dough and yeasty notes too. Maybe even some sugar, but minimal. Nothing is exaggerate, balance at its top. But flavor, its the real show: malt, caramel, molasses, blood orange, star fruit, grapes, white wine, brandy, burned sugar, walnut (!), Fact is, its incredibly complex. SO complex. But pleasant, and you literaly fear to finish it so fast. Alcohol doesnt disturb or annoying you. Carbonation is nearly perfect, and nothing, NOTHING has the strength to shock you: every component has its dignity, and makes you appreciate it. Finish is initially that of a white wine, but after it turns to the dryness of a Gran Marnier or similar triple sec. Leaves the palate really harsh, even in the gums. And lasts, lasts.

1194,"2012-02-22",3.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 4/17/2010.  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.

My pour has a moderately hazy burnt orange color, with a 3 cm head with good retention. Nice lacing sticks to the glass.

90 minute IPA has a robust hop aroma, with a fuller spectrum as it warms. Earthy and floral notes predominate. The complex nose makes it difficult to distinguish the various aromas.

Although the taste is balanced with a moderate malt presence and even possesses a caramel sweetness, the real draw is the hops. With quite a few types, the complexity on the tongue is a real treat. Sweet fruits, pine and floral hops, soft grapefruit, and lemon rind all have a noticeable presence. Finishes with a sweet and bitter twist, with a mildly bitter aftertaste.

A creamy and oily feel, and the crisp carbonation bites just a little bit. The combined effect creates a smooth effect, while letting the flavor pop as well.

To me, the 90 minute has a nice balance of depth and complexity that can normally be found in Dogfish Head offerings. Carefully constructed, with a great taste and full aroma that make it easy to drink.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

A - Pours deep amber orange with a thick pillow of one and a half finger tall head leaving light rings of lacing down the glass.

S - Smells of strong caramel malt sweetness, dulled citric hops, pine, and some faded out citric fruit. This one appears to be a bit old...

T - Starts off with a quick burst of piney hops quickly giving way to a mix of strong caramel malt sweetness and dulled citric fruit. Finish is a mix of caramel sweetness and hop bitterness, lingering for some time. I love 90min. but this bottle is just a bit past its prime.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Full bodied with a mix of sweetness and bitterness in the finish.

This is the model Imperial IPA - variants from this can be very good, but in the Imperial IPA world, this should likely serve as the model.

Needless to say, this is a very solid beer that I would never say no to.  This imperial IPA shows off a deep caramel color with a fragrant, thick head that gets slightly rocky as it recedes.  In the glass, it has excellent lacing and amazing head retention.  In the nose, you can really smell the residual sugars, malt and an ample, fruity hop kick that has a solid grapefruity twang to it.  There are also notes of pine, passionfruit and pineapple.  There are some other pungent fruity flavors lurking under the nose as well.  On the palate, the beer is thick, creamy and fruity-sweet with a slight alcohol present and more grapefruity hops with citrus zest and melon.  There is an underlying candied sugar quality to it, almost like a musky cotton candy.  Either way, its delicious.   The sweetness doesnt get cloying, but it can make your lips a little sticky.  This beer finishes with more malty fruit and some bitter sweetness.  When you put the glass down, the lacing still remains as a testament to this giant.

Overall- Top 3 session beer IMO.  I try to have a 4-pack on hand at all times.  My first experience from DFH was perhaps my favorite.  All that I really want and need in an Imperial IPA.","Pennsylvania, USA","dfhhead25"
1194,"2011-10-25",4.1,"355ml bottle. Smell is strong hops in the usual pine/spruce/grapefruit sort of way. Aroma is big and bold, but not aggressive. It doesnt attack so much as envelop. Poured orange/amber, somewhere between filtered and cloudy. Hazy, maybe. Decent foamy white head that leaves lots of lacing. Taste is hop bomb, grapefruit and pine sap. It is bitter, but not offensively so. Not a trailing wheels IPA, but a hop head should find it more pleasant than challenge. A little sweetness, like pink grapefruit. Body is thick, but not too think, texture is a little soapy. Dry finish.
Overall: Not sure if this is the best IPA in America, but it is definitely a contender. It is a nice drinking beer.","Saint John, New Brunswick, CANADA","HeistAlmighty"

1194,"2011-10-03",4.1,"Ported from BA.

Appearance: 
Light-amber or copper colored. Fairly clear. When first poured not much of a head, but about 10-15 seconds after pouring it rose up to about 1/2"" and then quickly settled back down.

Smell:
Hops, hops and more hops! And grapefruit. Smells a tad more sweet than your average IPA. A definite amarillo/simcoe combination. Looking it up, it also contains warrior hops, which dont come through in the aroma quite as clearly as the others.

Taste:
Very sweet while your lips are still on the glass, followed by a buildup of bitterness. Thats where the warrior hops went. A bit like a sour grapefruit, though meant in a complementary way. As the bitterness resides the high alcohol content becomes apparent. While not overwhelming, it definitely tells you that youre not drinking a regular pale ale.

Mouthfeel:
Reasonably smooth, somewhat creamy. The carbonation tickles the tongue a bit, and if it were flatter the creaminess would really come through. The feeling sticks in your mouth for a bit, which is nice because it lets you enjoy this 9% beer a bit more slowly, but still taste and feel it.

Drinkability:
Everything but the ABV and the price makes it very drinkable. If youre a hophead you could probably drink several, but the ABV will limit you if you have to drive home, and the price per 4 pack will limit you if youre on a budget.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

This one, just like a whisky thats been aged longer, is much rounder, more balanced. Pours amber with fairly big tan head. Aroma is sweet, caramel and vanilla, with a hoppy backdrop but more citrus and orange than bitter grapefruit. Taste is also sweet up front before the hops kick in. You can definitely tell the alcohol is there, but more from the swetness than from direct taste. Body is very rich and creamy with low, subtle carbonation.

Fairly sweet and fairly bitter, not too intense either way, pretty well balanced. Medium bodied, oily, pretty actively carbed, bright, with a lengthy herbal bitter finish.

But the smell of 90 is its greatest feature, a huge, amazing wall of grapefruit rind and skunky weed, one that near-staggers your olfactory sense.  The taste carries over this citric, herbal hop madness, yet with a startling amount of malt sweetness to balance out the brew.   This honey-like center adds a good bit of heft to 90-Minute, making the bitter, warm fade much closer to liquor than it should be.  Still, the nose alone is worth the price of admission.

The beer pours a very dark color and one might not again discern it as a DIPA. The taste lets you know it is a DIPA but not that super hoppy bomb that dominates the category.  Its got some pine but mostly the malts come into play and go very nice with the hoppiness and bitterness of the beer.

S - Aroma is full of citrus and floral hops. There is also a nice balance of sweet malt and a bit of bread also in the nose. Just a touch of booze evident.

T - Starts off with some nice building bitterness and some sweet malt and a touch of citrus. Really nice and balanced from the start.

6/21/11 (8/4/8/4/16 = 4) Bottle.  Pours more of a rusty copper with a small tan (almost brown) head and lots of visible carbonation.  Im not getting the bubble gum aroma I apparently experienced below; citrus is still there with some apricot, caramel.  Definitely very sweet; this isnt a hop explosion but there is a good balance with the malt.  Doesnt hide the 9% incredibly well.  Sticky/chewy; finishes slightly bitter.

3/4/11 (10/3/9/5/17 = 4.4) Tap @ Urge.  Pours a dark copper with good lacing.  Aroma of bubble gum and citrus hops.  A very malty drink, and not nearly as hoppy as I expected.  Smooth mouthfeel with just the perfect touch of bitterness at the end.  Quite good.","San Diego, California, USA","jlieber17"

1194,"2011-03-04",4.0,"Pours amber with a minimal white head.  The nose is actually really nice: sweet and extremely floral.  The flavor is somewhat malty and fairly sweet, but not so much that it turns me off.  This very much strikes me as a classic East Coast IIPA with a good dose of hops that is well-balanced by a noticeable malt backbone.  Im a West Coast IIPA guy, but this is a really nice change of pace from time to time, and, I think the best beer Ive ever had from Dogfish Head.","Connecticut, USA","sepia5"

Big American hoppy aroma, with a slight hint of peach/lemon and some slight breadiness. Initial taste is big and malty, almost like fruitcake, before a hoppy bitterness thats unmistakeably there, but more subtle than you would think. 9.0% ABV certainly warms you up.

This is my first DIPA so Im reviewing this more as a master of other styles.

I pour it into my tulip glass it pours a nice rich copper/amber/red. Decent head retention in my Duvel glass as it recedes after a few minutes leaving very nice lacing. 

Smells hoppy im not smelling really any malts just some grapefruit and piney notes.

Taste is fantastic, and suprisingly theres malt here. That was the big shocker here for me being my first DIPA. Not a huge blast but enough. But up front you get that hop madness, with some pine and citrus notes. Finishes with a good malt flavor thats a bit syrupy.

To me this beer has exceptional mouthfeel and is much more drinkable then anticipated.

1194,"2011-02-04",4.5,"I was pleasantly surprised by this brew that is for sure. I expected a harsh overly hoppy and bitter experience. Brewed with hops for 90 minutes and dry hopped? What I did not understand was the hop and malt choices that blend to a well balanced easy drinking IPA with no harsh bitter. Surprised indeed. 

Pours clear copper with a two finger white head that fades a little after a few minutes. Citrusy aroma with a light smell of raisen? The hops are well played, but the malts really shine in my opinion. The earthy citrusy tastes are balanced with a slight sweet toffee flavor. a light toasty taste to the toffee. Texture was full with a lively carbonation. Very very enjoyable.","Texas, USA","rwilcox42"

Nose is predominantly hoppy - a nicely balanced note between pine and floral with a hint of citrus, and a little bit of toasted bread in the background.  Taste is also well balanced - saying a lot for how much bitterness is here - you get a big malt note of caramel and toast first as a grapefruit and moderatly bitter note builds in and lasts through a moderately bitter, slightly spicy finish with just a little hint of alcohol warming as the glass warms.

Taste: Hops galore. Big, but sweet,soft and rounded hop character, piney, grassy, resiny. Fruity (orange, passionfruit, peach). Sticky sweet maltiness / caramel / nutty notes.

Its hard to find thanks to that show on Discovery which irritates me because this is the IPA I want whenever Im eating something spicy.

Finish:  ngering, bitter and chalky dry, with flavors of tangy floral hops and dry dark brown bread lingering.  Notes:  Definitely more rich than the 60 minute version, but not too much more bitter.

The malt backbone is more than a backbone, it is really where the soul of this beer lies, and that maltiness is pleasant and delicious.

1194,"2010-12-27",5.0,"Swirl this around in your glass and you will be hit in the face with a fruity hop farm of smells. It gets backed up by a sweet smell as well. The taste has that really forward citrus hop flavor with some of that fruity sweet malt/yeast flavors. It finishes with a herbal almost piney bitter hop taste you should get from an Imperial IPA. The blend is fantastic and you really couldnt ask for much more in a beer. It has a bold to medium body as it should for 9 percent alcohol. Which by the way is extremely well masked by the bitter and fruity hop flavors. It may not be as bitter as some other Imperial IPAs (even though its pretty bitter) it incorporates that hop flavor the most... just as how Dogfish claims... so it isnt your typical IPA. You shouldnt be let down this unless you get it not so fresh which will bring down the hop bitterness. So get this fresh!","New Jersey, USA","thebrood1987"

Like all beers it is all in the eye of the beholder with their individual tastes.  Myself personally, I am not the biggest fan of IPAs, but Dogfish Head still produced a very nice high quality beer.  I would have to say like all Dogfish Head beers that the aroma was fantastic.  A characteristic that really starts off the party and is often overlooked.  It had a very nice heavy dry hop aroma and a white mostly lasting head.  The beer had a beautiful cloudy appearance to it and surprised me with an initial sweet flavor in the beginning.  The middle yielded a fruity touch with the common bitter finish with IPAs that was quite delightful.  A full body on the palate with a soft carbonated oily texture with a long lasting bitter finishes.  I am always impressed with what Dogfish Head produces, and love their TV show on Discovery.

Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA. (India Pale Ale) I had it in 12oz bottle, poured into a pint glass. Pours a orange-bronze color. Thin, 1-finger head.

Like the smell, I also taste citrus and pine notes. Mostly the latter. A little alcohol taste in there too. (9% ABV, stronger than your average beer.) Slight creaminess but not too thick. Crisp.

1194,"2010-10-21",4.4,"Time to step things up a notch and try out the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA.  Ive been holding onto this one for a couple of weeks but I figured Id better drink it before it loses the majority of its hop characteristics.  Pours kind of a tangelo orange brown, with very little head.  Granted, Im using a snifter for this one so I wasnt really looking for a big ass head.  I might use a tumbler if I come across one of these again.  Nose is an incredible detonation of hop aroma.  Floral and citrus hops are there and theres this raisin sent underneath, almost like what youd get out of a dark Belgian strong ale.  Kind of surprising, actually.  My first impressions while taking my sample is dang, this beer is smooth.  Its very full, almost thick, with a slight alcohol burn in the finish.  Its more well rounded and less sharp than the 60 minute IPA, especially in the finish.  Theres hops here, to be sure, and well catalog those in a moment, but I think its important to note I actually think this may be less bitter than the 60 minute IPA.  Either that, or the assload of malt thats in this lends a huge sweetness that helps you push through the bitterness.  I mentioned the Belgian Strong earlier when talking aroma, and that comparison is valid when talking about the mouthfeel.  Its thick, bordering on syrupy.  Huge sticky lacing just coats the glass.  Raisins are there in the taste too.  Its extremely malt centric, with a roasted caramel syrup note that really sticks out for me.  The hops are most certainly there in this one, with pine and orange rind coming out the more that you drink it.  Theyre not as pronounced as I would like.  Not sure if thats what the brewer intended, or because this one sat on the shelf for a while before I picked it up.  Regardless, this is one phenomenal beer.  As I said Im not completely sold on it being a double IPA, but its very good nonetheless.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

Pours a clear orange to amber coloured beer. Practically no head. Aroma has spices, pepper, cloves, some sweet malts. Taste has sweet malts, spices and a little hop bitter. Aftertaste has fruity hops, passion fruits and pineapple. Maybe because weve been drinking/building up to this one, but it doesnt taste as bitter as I expected. Very nice complexity in it though.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
1194,"2010-10-03",4.6,"A- Poured into Snifter. Nice Golden Auburn, Orangery colour. Clear as well. Nice foamy head that lingered fairly long.

S- Super hoppy. Wonderful smell the hops are very floral and heavy. Also picking up lots of fruity smells. Apricot seems to be present, along with what seems like berries (strawberries, raspberries)

T- Very Sweet. the hops are wonderful, far better than the 60 min. The fruity flavour comes out with the hops and blends with them very nicely. There is also a hint of some citrus flavours. The beer has a very smooth mouth feel as well and sits in the mouth nice and somewhat creamy texture. There is very little bitterness to be had as well in the after taste, also an improvement over the 60 min.

D- Definitely one of the best ipas out there. Hops and fruitiness and balanced very well to make for a beer that is very enjoyable to drink.","Ontario, CANADA","case4816"

T: I remember this being way hoppier before. This is so well-balanced. Wonderful citrus hops, mostly or all Simcoe, matched perfectly with the sweet malts. such a solid flavor. I pull some oak characteristics as well.

Ive had the 60 minute IPA before, which is great, along with the 120 minute IPA, which is destructive.

Aroma is a fantastic balance of citrus hops and woodsy/roasted malt.  Appearance is a very clear amber with a thin head.

The dominant taste, and aroma, here is grapefruit. Surprisingly drinkable, with the alcohol somewhat well hidden, it sneaks up on you though (comes out more as it warms).

A - Copper/light amber color with a large foamy and fluffy white head. Good retention with a decent layer of lace that sticks behind.

S - Good amount of different hoppy aromas come out with citrus/orange aroma, tropical fruit (mango, some pineapple, grapefruit, and others). Some floral and pine also present. Good backbone of caramel and other sweet malt aroma.

T - Similar to the nose. A lot of the hop flavors are sweeter fruit flavors along with touches of floral and pine flavors. Along with the sweeter caramel malt, this is a bit of a sweeter IPA. Not a lot of caramel flavor, but some, and definitely a malt presence in this one. There is a nice spiced and bitterness underneath this and some more earthy flavors as well.

M - Fuller side of medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty smooth.

D - Pretty easy to drink with lots of fruity hop flavors. Definitely has a sweeter side, but there is enough bitterness and other flavors that it isnt cloying. Alcohol is pretty well hidden.

1194,"2010-08-01",3.9,"A tall white head tops this deep amber ale and when this diminishes it leaves a layer of tight lacing.  A perfectly rounded aroma of pine, malt, lemon grass, grapefruit and mango rises to the nose.  Its a mellow scent, certainly not as zesty as some single hopped IPAs but just as certainly its more complex.  There are notes of raisins and marmalade, maybe just a little brandy.  In the mouth its thick and oily with rich, heavy hops.  The continual addition process really does round the flavour.  It goes from fresh passion fruit to woody straw in a second; but then the tastes develop backwards and forwards between sips.  Finish is bitter and sweet.  Its so easy to grow a bit bored with this, due to the wide regard and easy availability, but every time I actually have one Im reminded of just how good it really is.

Smell: Pine and grapefruit hops are dominant with a nice sweet floral and citrus background.

1194,"2010-07-08",2.1,"While Dogfish Head claims that their 90 minute iPA is balanced, I beg to differ. To me, it tastes like the malt and the hops are battling one another for the spotlight rather than working together for the good of the beer. Each mouthful involves a massive infusion of citrusy hops followed quickly by a thick, cloying sweetness. Rather than the crisp mouthfeel of most IPAs, this one has an oily, slippery character to it. After drinking a few of these, I find each one more distasteful than the last. The robust flavors just dont work well together. Compared to Dogfish Heads excellent 60 minute IPA, which I absolutely love, their 90 minute variant is practically drainworthy.","Maryland, USA","rhoderickj"

On tasting its very sweet - candy sugar or bubblegum comethrough at first, then a lot of malt, loads of caramel, and some more pine skulking along behind.  A bit minty too.  A dirty, pithy bitterness lurks behind, but its not enough to balance the sweetness.  The mouthfeel is syrupy; too much so by the end.

Update on the taste and aroma, the rest is pretty accurate.  Rating on those from recent tasting and went up from previous bottle rating.

S-The nose is bready with caramel malts up front.  Peach and citrus are present behind, huge balance and interesting aroma.

T-taste follows the nose, huge malt presence, lots of toasted bread and some caramel, good hop backing, notes of peach and citrus, hints of herbal marijuanna and grapefruit, light lingering bitterness.

Overall-love the balance now, very pleasant and still has a great hop presence but a beautiful malt balance make this a great bear to enjoy and I can actually keep drinking it unlike many of my favorite hop bombs that make me suffer towards the end of a growler.

***************************

A-very clear golden amber color, pure white head that is thick and creamy. Solid retention on the head leaving a nice lacing on the glass

S-the nose is faint, light grapefruit notes stand out with hints of pale malts and touches of biscuit.

T-the taste is more like a decent pale ale. Pale malts are quite present, grapefruit, peach and a touch of citrus compliment, notes of bready malt towards the back and just a touch of bitterness

M-medium body and extremely smooth. Great texture with just enough carbonation to give it a great feel throughout. Its actually quite creamy and inviting

D-solid brew, not as hoppy as i remember it; but still quite nice. a little honey maybe? great feel, nice texture, some balance.

The smell is extremely intense, but it is quite a challenge to tell whether there is more maltiness or hoppiness in it. I also got some tropical fruit notes, like mango and papaya. The list of aromatic notes includes, but is not limited to: caramel, bread, toffee, oranges, grapefruit, pine needles, even chocolate!

The taste: Hops, more hops, then malts, and more malts! Packs a very good hop punch, with equal amounts of resinous pine and citrusy grapefruit, with some bitterness. The malts bring a very nice sweet breadiness to the finish, which is definitely more on the malty side. Not much bitterness lingers on. Very flavourful and balanced.

Medium-to-full body to it. Smooth, but slightly sticky and syrup-like.The alcohol is well-masked, but you will probably feel it. After a while, it gets a bit more difficult to swallow.

The aroma. Oh the aroma. Just a big fat burst of hops. A slightly sweet smell is the perfect balance. Its just teasing me. As it warms up, the hops move to the background and the malt takes over. 

The first cold sip is filled with a sweet, hoppy goodness. And a surprisingly strong malt backing. The distinct elements swirl together to create a rich beer that is loaded with flavor. Each sip is sweet, bitter and malty all at the same time. I wonder how long they added hops for. 

The feel is a bit fizzy, but does not detract. Still very easy to drink, and smooth considering the higher carbonation. As it warms up and the carbonation goes down, it becomes a creamy, cozy beer.

The hops might not be as fresh as you would like but a few months hasnt hurt this beer too much. It has a supple texture without being overly malty like some high ABV imperials can err towards.

1194,"2010-04-24",3.8,"90 Minute was once the benchmark for Double IPAs among my beer-drinking friends.  Pliny the Elder has, for me, redefined this variety.  90 Minute is high on hops and malt.  It is 90 Minutes malt balance that reduces its appeal as DIPA.  90 minutes malt balance is cloying, almost syrupy sweet  -- it lacks the citrus/grapefruit tartness of the best hop DIPAs.  For this reason, 90 Minute is not very drinkable -- a far cry  from the two Plinys. Other, far well less known DIPAs, such as Squatters Hop Rising outshine this overrated beer.

1194,"2010-03-31",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2010 Bottle. Amber, coating beige head. Smells of poached quinces and other autumnal fruits as well as bass register pine and citrus. And brandy. Quite restrained nose. Real sweetness in the heavy and complex dark sugar malts followed by strong and persistent but not egregious bitterness. Quite syrupy and not unlike a fortified wine finished with bitter herbs. Balanced but tiring - Id be happy to share a small bottle of this amongst three. [3.6] Colder this time (10C) and its less tiring to drink and rather less fortified wine-like. But the flavours are very compressed and the overall effect is a dull roar. The notion that an IPA might not travel still seems like a joke to me, but maybe some sparkle has been lost on the journey.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
1194,"2010-03-30",3.8,"12 ounce bottle from South Bay Drugs ($3.99).  Pours an orange-amber with one finger of white foam.  There are floaties in there which I assume are hop remnants.  Aroma is more muted than I might have expected but consists mainly of hops (peach, orange, grass).  Flavor of course is full of hops (more peach, grass, apricot, spicy) and has an impressive balancing malt component.  The finish is not very bitter and trends toward sweet.  Also contains a certain amount of booze.  Generally well balanced and good but not quite up to the level of some of the better California DIPAs.

1194,"2010-03-29",3.2,"(I believe this was my second review; score is from a more recent tasting) This beer is sublime. It was one of the first beers that I discovered through the internet and one of the best beers I tried in the first few months of drinking good beer. Dogfish Head is a masterful brewery and I dearly wish that they would distribute more styles out to California. This beer pours a beautiful amber with a fine sticky head. It smells just exquisite. Its sweet and oily with hops. The hops are citric but smoother than most hop bills on a DIPA. Theres also better balancing malt than some competitors. The beer is honey sweet and floral with bittersweet finish that hits the spot. The feel is like a gentle surf breaking on your tongue. Its just fantastic beer.

T: The hop flavor is mostly bitter grapefruit. There is also a very strong malt component that has a very roasted, yet sweet flavor. The finish is a bit of pine and some more grapefruit.

M: This is actually quite full bodied, but thats not too surprising for a double IPA. The tiny carbonation bubbles help to keep things from getting too heavy.

1194,"2009-12-26",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2013 This is a revision of my rating from 2009-12-26. 12 oz. bottle from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, served in a tulip. Pours clear copper-amber with a small off white head. The head slowly fades to a thin cover and leaves a small amount of fine lace. The nose has huge citrus and pine, along with caramel and bread, flowers and a touch of perfume. The flavour is very well balanced between complex caramel malts and big, floral, perfumey, citrus hops. It is fairly acidic. The finish is long, peppery and bitter resiny hops. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, milky texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is easily one of the best double IPAs out there. Definitely one to keep on hand. 2011-05-19

Addendum: Randallized at Dogfish Head Brewing & Eats. Basically a sweeter, subtler version of 90, with a nice Cascade nose and citric, slightly piney flavour. It feels a bit more spicy as well. 2012-06-08","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

1194,"2009-12-17",4.1,"12 oz bottle. The balance of this beer has always really stood out to me. It really is perfect in that aspect. As far as the aroma goes, it really is more mild than you would expect from a hop bomb. Non-hop notes on the aroma include a light oaky bourbon, nutty caramel, apple pie, and other mild fruits. Also some earth, mixed citrus, and light resin on the hop side of things. Lighter white head on the pour, minor lacing and retention, medium opacity, and dark orange in color. Again, balance is fantastic in the taste, and a nice feel as well with a light crisp bite throughout. A lot of mild wood and fruits here, apples and apricots, along with some earthy pine, bitter citrus, minor bourbon, and mixed grain cereal. The finish is very evened out for dipa.

So, I bellied up to the bar at The House Pub in St. Charles, IL., and ordered a 12oz. bottle. Poured to a large snifter, the color was a deep, orangy amber with a white, bubbly foam head, and spots and ribbons of clingy lacing. The aroma was an intense combination of fruit sweetness and bright, sharp citrus. The flavor followed these with a potent hop bitterness that was balanced nicely by rich malt sweetness, and warming alcohol.

T: This is where this baby shines. This is one of the best DIPAs out there. Tons of citrus blast your tongue putting your senses into overload. Just enough malt is used to mute the hops a bit so that they dont totally trash your taste buds. Hoppy, sweet, and wonderful. The crown gem in the DFH crown.

Amazingly well-balanced IIPA.  In fact, this is probably one-half of the golden standard for IIPA.  I know that it wont be everyones favorite, but this is one of those beers that HAS to be on the drank-list to be able to say that you are a true beer-nerd.

The taste is interesting, with firm sweetness, bitterness, and spiceiness, all coordinated and balanced nicely.  It tastes of dry bread crust and prunes with hints of grapefruit, leaves, caramel, candied fruit, spicey raisins, candy, alcoholic spice and warmth.

Have been looking for this for some time after having had the 60 and 120 min.
And surprise, not a lot on the nose.  Very shy, some orange but overall way to subdued. Where is the bitterness? This is an IIPA, right?
Like wine is it just a matter of balance? If so I can aggree with the hype.
Orange with low head. Beautifull colour.
Citrus nose, lacks some in complexity. Very nice bitteness, but far from what I expect in an IIPA.
Very sweet with loads of dried fruit.
Wonderfull balance, wonderfull creaminess and mouthfeel.
Nothing extreme about this one, and maybe that is the greatness? Oh, and where is the alcohol? Maybe I had to many (strong) beers tonight to rate it properly? Will have to rebuy some time.

This is a Big beer.  Great floral character in the nose, it is a slight let down when it gets in your mouth.  The malt seems to dominate, which is a good thing if you are a fan of the East coast style.  Good lacing, great drinkability, etc.  Great beer.

I do recommend puring this in a snifter or any other glass that can capture the aroma, as there is quite a profile to sample here.","Plainfield, Illinois, USA","popephred"
1194,"2009-08-16",3.2,"I think I like this a little better than the 60 minute IPA.  The hops are stronger but the general flavor seems a little bit more interesting.  Overall, I think the flavors seem unbalanced or unblended.  As in, the malts, hops and fruity overtone flavors seemed immediately separate on my tongue. For that reason, it doesnt get a higher rating.

However, I was served this beer very poorly... with a glass at all! (so I resorted to a plastic cup) and at too cold a temperature. 

I would like to try this again done the right way in the future. Maybe the flavors will be better.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"

HUGE in all respects while still maintaining integrity and respect for the palate with a fine balancing malt character.  Probably too malty for what Id consider and IPA, with a little toasty melanoidin character lurking in there, but a fine fine beer that Id love to try fresh.  IPAs (and IIPAs especially) can be be all aroma show and not enough palate dough... this is not one of those imposters.  Food pairing: the best, big, fresh and delicious burger you can wrap your mouth around.  Vegetarian is even better but Id lower myself to some meat.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"
1194,"2009-08-14",3.8,"How this stands up depends almost entirely on the serving temp. When served warmed up properly, the smell is a blossom of hops, peach, apricot, bubblegum. The taste is complex and unique ~ butterscotch, rum, sugar, hops, more peaches, ghee. The hop balance is pretty strong yet this is quite drinkable. However, this particular IPA has a very ""locked in"" sort of taste compared to other IPAs that I like that tend to have a more open, loose, and free kind of taste. I find this kind of flavour profile to be a bit of a trademark with every single DFH brew that I have ever had. Its a bit hard for me to explain...I do like this beer, but I find it to be a hugely unrepresentative of the traditional IPA style. That is waht DFH does best though, right? So...cheers to this amazing and singular example of an interesting beer done...right? Sure...just be sure to warm it up.","JAPAN","buzzoven"

1194,"2009-08-12",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2010 New Rating: Holy CRAP! Now I get it. From the way it looks in the glass (crystal clear amber, with a pillowy beige head), to the perfumey and heady oranges and fruitcake aroma, to the luscious, deeply complex flavours of wood, brandy, oranges, and madeira... this is everything I want in a beer and nothing I dont. So glad I gave it another crack.

Old rating: Theres so much complexity to this beer, but alas, its lack of freshness is showing. I am rating it as it stands (and I dont think 3.6 is bad given age and distance travelled) but its become overwhelmingly malty - tasting of maltesers - and needs a re-rate when I taste it fresh.

Smell: The aroma is full of sweet malt and pine resin and citrus hops.

Taste/Mouth Feel: The flavor hits you with a full bodied punch of piney, resiny and citrus hops balanced by thick sweet malt and sweet warming brandy like alcohol. It finishes with more herbal and piney bitterness. The palate has a smooth mellow carbonation with a smooth slick almost sticky texture.

Beautifully floral with peaches, apricot nectar, more fruits that I didnt have time to identify, weak pine, raisins maybe, thick malts. The taste was incredible form first sip - the wonderful aroma just set that up. Intense hops of grapefruit, orange, lemon, sweet bready malts, soft caramel, tastes like flowers smell, weak molasses. Its all just put together so nicely. Every sip I told my wife that this is one of the best tasting beers Id ever had in my life. Smooth on the mouth with good, soft carbonation, deceiving bitterness that was no where near as taste bud crippling as I figured it would be.

Crystal-clear copper color with sparse carbonation. Head is thin and dissipates quickly, leaving yeasty bubbles.

Extra-grassy and earthy hops, but there is that DFH tell that I remember profusely...quite a bit of earth. Theres actually a little cowpie stench in there, too. Copious amber/caramel malt.

Even thought theres clamminess and the cowpie stench shows up in the back of the palate, there is a nice malty taste to this with slightly alcoholic sweetness. Still...that extra-earthy tone detracts from this quite a bit and grassys up the hop bitterness a great deal. Good, but not as impressive as one would expect.

Palate feel is OK once the earth is traversed. Its mostly amber maltiness, with some austere grassy hops and maybe some pinyness. Still, that signature DFH earthy aftertaste will bite down on it hard.

Now I remember why I havent picked this one up recently. Decently-crafted but maybe its the water that provides that ultra-earthiness. Not for me.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

1194,"2009-06-14",4.0,"Bottle. Poured with an average-sized, white head and a clear body, with nice lacing. Nice, golden-copper color. The aroma hits you like a ton of bricks - light malt and yeast, heavy hops, and quite heavy on the alcohol... but in a good way. Light melon aroma as well. Great on the palate: medium body, average carbonation, with a bitter finish. As for the flavor, this beer is more alive than most Ive tried. Lightly sweet, quite bitter, but not at all overpowering, and while you can taste the alcohol, you wouldnt necessarily guess that its a 9% ABV. Theres so much going on in this beer its hard to put it in words. Ive never been a huge IPA fan but this was quite the experience.","New Brunswick, CANADA","Berley31"

As it warms, it becomes more heavy on the sweet malts; cloying. Flavour is malts with a candy-like sweetness. Hops roaming around somewhere in the background, but not very outspoken. Has some similarities with a Belgian strong ale; a blend of alcohol, brandy and plums. But the sweet malts reminds me more of a overly sweet brown ale. Finish is grassy, and quite sweet and malty. Cloying. Develops some liquorice notes as it warms. Faint spicy notes lingering. Not very bitter; a medium bitterness lingering. Soft palate.

Palate starts surprisngly sweet, then ends up quite sour in the finish, which is a sensation I thoroughly enjoy. Pine, grapefruit, malt, lemon, apples, with surprisingly restrained hops, although you get all of the character. No booziness or alcohol, very, very well done.

Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth, but just slightly sticky.  Even at 9% ABV, the alcohol is almost unnoticeable.

It is a hop explosion but it has a lot more going on, the after taste is a tad sweet; it is a good counter taste for the bitterness from the hops.

Fairly thick, slightly creamy mouthfeel, mild carbonation.  Quick bitter citrus bite on the front of the tongue.  Quickly followed by a strong floral hop taste, with a little citrus, a hint of caramal and bready sweetness.

Aroma is nice and big with citrusy hops and a decent amount of caramel malt--a little sweeter than I usually like my IIPAs, but still very nice. The taste is initially sweet, the hops and malt combine to form an almost nutty taste that I often find in barley wines. A little alcohol becomes detectable as it warms, as do some notes of lime. There is certainly a good deal of hop influence, but it is not as bitter as I had expected, with the malt taking center stage much of the time. Despite this, it actually does work for it, and is enjoyable. Pretty good mouthfeel, quite smooth, and has a long, dry finish. Not the kind of IIPA that I am usually crazy about, with the malt so forward, but it turned out pretty well despite that. A very solid, albeit not spectacular beer.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

A very sweet start, with a light but rich maltiness that fades into more and more citrus, with a slightly warm bitter finish. Full bodied with light but lively carbonation. Well done.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"
1194,"2009-03-28",3.5,"Appearance: Pours an impressive clear medium burnt orange color with a diminutive tan-colored head.  Right off the bat I can tell you there is not as much head as I normally like to see on an Imperial IPA.  Even a forceful swirl of the glass brings minimal head to the surface. There is, however, a nice bit of lacing which at least proves theres something good going on in this bottle. 

Smell:  When I hear people say that Imperial IPAs smell like cat urine I typically scowl in skepticism.  However, I really do get that aroma in the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA; and I mean that in the best way possible.  Along with this strong presence of pungent hops and powerful malt comes a touch of orange caramel, and oddly enough, even a faint smell of espresso beans. 

Taste:  This definitely tastes like an Imperial IPA, yet it has a heaviness that you dont normally find in its class.  Even as I taste it Im reminded of the same bitterness one might expect from the mouth feel of an espresso.  And while I do only get a faint taste of coffee, there is clearly enough hops to keep it firmly planted in IPA territory. 

Mouthfeel: There is a good amount of bitterness here.  Although, I would hope that an Imperial IPA would have a touch more luster than this seems to have.  The bitterness and flavor profile that is left behind is quite pleasurable, though.

Overall: Not as impressed as Id hoped, but Id definitely drink a shit ton of these again.  The hoppy bitterness is really pleasing and the flavor it leaves behind is quite enjoyable.  At 9% ABV, I think this is a good session beer if enjoyed 12 ounces at a time.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","amneziak"

Im keeping my old rate just so I can see how much my opinion of this beer has changed.  The aroma was nice and full of sweet citrus fruits like mangoes, grapefruits, and oranges.  A bit piney at times, but mostly fruity with some nice bitter hops in there as well.  The flavor was much improved with it being mostly dominated by sweet mangoes and tangerines.  Simply divine!  The finish was long and heavy, bitter and dry, yet complex and very enjoyable.  My palate has really changed over the years and I now really enjoy this one.

I know Im supposed to love this beer, its a god of IPAs.  However, I dont, and I enjoy IPAs.  The aroma had faint floral notes, but nothing impressive.  The flavor seemed to be pointlessly bitter.  There is very little hop character to this beer, other than just being bitter.  Its not that I dont like IPAs, I do.

Aroma is pretty straightforward, but plentiful. Lots of woody bitter hops and a plethora of caramel. The caramel malts have a ""cooked"" character to them in that they arent burnt, but it seems like they are on the verge of toasted. Sweet, sugary boozy backing as well. Flavor is initially a big, biscuit malt quickly infused with an almost harsh bitter citrus. Lots of that ""cooked"" caramel again and even a bit of licorice flavoring. Finishes very woody and dry with a touch of sugary booze warmth. Palate is medium to full and somewhat harsh, although very well balanced. Overall, a really nice DIPA with a great balance of flavors.

Robust malty base with notes of licorice and a touch of caramel, accompanied by delicate fruity flavours of raisins, citrus and pineapples.

1194,"2009-02-15",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2009 12oz bottle at RFD.   Bright amber with a creamy head.   The aroma definitely lets you know its DFH--there is something about the hops, maybe the result of the continuous hopping, that is quite similar to the 60min, with a grapefruit and melon fruity quality.   They are also more floral and piney here though, which I like more.   There is also a good bread crust and caramel balance.   The flavor comes as expected after the aroma with a good balance of fruity melon and citrus, floral and piney hops and bready caramel maltiness.   Malty, yes, but with a big bitterness in the finish to balance.   Not a kick of pure hops, but for what theyre going for this is quite nice.
Draught at Toronado SD.   Thought it would be fun to compare this with the local IPAs that I has been having this weekend.  Very sweet, syrupy, and malty in comparison.   Didnt seem this sweet out of the bottle before, but I really was not digging this on tap nearly as much.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Aroma is lots of citrus and pine hops with candied fruits, rum,  caramel malts, grapefruit rind, and some dried grain. Flavor is sweet - rich milk caramel malts, puffed wheat cereal adding a bit of toasty/roasty appeal, more candied fruit.

 Then the strong-ish hops come in. First lemon candy with some lime bitterness, lots of pine, grapefruit, honey bitter hops, a very slight earthy backbone to tie all of the flavors together and make it seem really a hearty, wholesome brew. 

The puffed wheat cereal comes back for the finish and holds on with the only slightly bitter, mostly pine and citrus hops for the finish. 

The feel is slick, yet a little sticky, and substantial, like a good IIPA should be. 

Overall it is a fantastic beer that just oozes complexity. While it has hops and malt in spades it really suprised me how the rather strong hops aroma turned into the flavor actually being fairly balanced, and hops a little on the weak side in my opinion for the style.

1194,"2008-10-11",4.1,"12 oz bottle. Pours honey in color with off-white dissolving head. Aroma has a quality of shellac; flavor has a huge frontal assault of hop bitterness with orange marmalade, and alcohol. It provides one cohesive aggressive flavor and finish: malty caramel sweetness balanced by this signature bold (but not coarse) hop presence that is not distinctly citrus peel or pine, just outrageous. (Reminds me of an improvement on Port Brewing Tide IPA, the coarse one. Would like to try 60-minute.)

1194,"2008-09-13",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2009 Summary: Deliciously sweet, syrupy malt bomb, and then the hops come out to play just when you thought it was safe to swallow.  Aroma: Intense hops, mostly pine, some grapefruit. Appearance: Clear caramel-colored medium amber, puts forth a thick, dense, off-white head that leaves abundant lace. Flavor: Big malt presence, honey, caramel, vanilla, somewhat boozy.  The hops are there, but dont become the dominant element until the finish, pine, a little citrus.  Bitterness lingers on the cheeks and lips.  Palate: Thick, syrupy while drinking, hops leave a cooling tingle in the mouth that trumps any alcohol warming.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"

1194,"2008-09-06",3.6,"Be careful with this one.  I have had two different bottles from the same four pack which were completely different beers.  If you get one that’s the way it’s supposed to be, it’s a hoppy IPA that’s simultaneously completely drinkable, more subtle than a Ruination even.  If you get a bad one, it’s a Dunkin’ Donuts regular with cream & no sugar.  Difficult beer to rate due to the inconsistency.  My personal opinion is that it’s Dogfish Head’s best when it’s on.  Citrus hops with a strong malt backbone almost every time.  I recommend, but recommend with the caveat that you’re purchasing an inconsistent product.","Westtown, New York, USA","NextBestThing"

The overwhelming flavors coming through are a cloying malt and a bold (and not pleasant in this instance) alcohol taste, with a medicinal, almost prune-like aftertaste. It has non of the hoppy bitterness expected from an IPA.

A good amount of malt flavor for a DIPA but the hops bitter is still there for your hop fix. Medium mouthfeel good carbonation for your tongue

Highly drinkable but I would keep myself to two a sitting because of the alcohol will sneak up on you. Like I said my go to DIPA for a long time","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"
1194,"2008-07-17",4.3,"12 oz bottle poured into tumbler. Tawny color, translucent. minimal, quickly dissapating white head. Low carbonation. Very little on the nose (probably because of my glass). Tastes of brown sugar, toast, spice, and pepper. Very long finish lingers on the palate with juniper flavors. Great flavor. Proof that a great IPA doesn’t have to be a puckered up hop bomb. Watch out!  This drinks easy at 9.1%! It’s a creeper.

Starts with a finger of white foam and leaves no lacing on the glass.  The flavor is big.  At first theres sweet maltiness followed by a very nice, balanced hop finish.

Elements of orange and brandy round the flavor so well and event he alcohol taste seems measured for the taste.

~Interesting hop scent. Im more used to westcoast hops. this scent reminds me of BBQ, which is a good thing. Earthy hop scent with some sweet maltiness.

~Im not sure what to make of this beer. I like it, but its so different than other DIPA  and IPAs Ive had. Honestly I dont think i would buy this beer again.

1194,"2008-06-26",4.6,"After having a couple more of these recently, Ive come to terms with what a unique, complex beer this is. The color is perfect. The aroma is a tropical fruit and sweet malt mix that I just adore. Those big tropical flavors show up on the first sip and never let up. The maltiness is the worker here: So much big malt to balance the hops. You get the best of both worlds instead of an overcarbonated hop-bomb that so many IIPAs turn out to be. Sticky, sweet, fruity, earthy and a lingering finish. Reminds me of Dreadnaught in that its so incredibly balanced. You get the best of both worlds, but to get the hops to smell and taste like that is truly art. Again, the drinkability and balance make this a really dangerous beer. A beauty.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"

This beer is just a pleasure to drink. Update (06.28.08) - This beer is overpowering, in a good way.

This beer comes out of the glass quite nice.  Healthy carbonation and brilliant clarity.  Deep rich mahogany brown with medium head retention.  This beer smells of the Marris Otter malt and seemingly English hops.  Curious for an American Double IPA.  I agree with many of the members from the west coast here that this is hardly an American DIPA.  It really carries itself more like an English Strong Ale.  Which is fine, but ""out west"" here we are not looking for the ""English"" in our American IPAs.  Double or single for that matter.

I find a lack of balance actually in this beer.  It should be better attenuated.  These beers should be HOP focused, not  MALT focused.  This, however, is typical of east coast beers.  I find that they are quite afraid of the bitterness that the cohumulone in hops has to offer.  Maybe because in Delaware the climate is colder and requires a richer beer.  Here on the West coast we like it DRY.   

Because of the rich Marris Otter backbone the melanoidens from the extended kilning process has given this beer a pleasing breadiness, that gives way to the alcohol flavor and aroma.  This is sexy as a winter warmer, but for a warm California evening......Nope.  It just doesnt make it.

This is a malt forward beer.  Hoppiness is only subtly apparent in the background.  As it warms it covers the mouth with an almost ""cream soda"" like aftertaste.  Not what I was expecting.

Please understand, I find this beer to be a  fine beer with excellent qualities, but it is NOT what the label says it is.  West coasters beware!!!!!!!  It is not what you think.  If you like the English beers, this will be one of your favorites.  If you like hoppy beers, you will be disappointed.  Sorry.  Just look at where the individuals are from that love the beer.  The mid west to the east coast.  On the west coast the ratings are not so good.  We have Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Ruination, Racer 5, Racer X, Hopsickle, 21IPA, Anderson Valley Double IPA, Moonlight IPA, Blind Pig , Russian River IPA, Union Jack, IPA Nectar, Stone IPA & so on.  These are DRY, HOPPY & REFRESHING.   

The crux of the matter, once again, is....Do you like it Malty or Hoppy?  This beer is Malty, NOT hoppy.  Period.

I just hope with all this East Coast, West Coast stuff,  we do not end up with some brewers getting shot in a brewing ""gang"" warfare episode.  Relax.  It is all good.  We all have different opinions on what an American IPA should be.  Personally, I know it to be something entirely different.

Much love to all.  I know this beer carries with it much strife and partisanship, but I think it is ok.","Sonoma, California, USA","bumpskier"
1194,"2008-06-03",5.0,"The best IPA Ive ever had.... hands down. I love this great Imperial IPA. It has a perfect score in all catagories in my book. The aroma has strong flowery notes, the appearance is a nice red coppery color, with a beautiful off white head that leave a dilicate lace in its trails. The flavor is outstanding with its fruity, earthy, citrusy notes. The combination of hops used in the beer is perfect for every hop lover. You get a mouth full of hops and malted barley that is perfect for the palate. At 9% abv you can have just 1 or 2 and youll be fellin good.","Corpus Christi, Texas, USA","hoplover"

1194,"2008-05-31",3.8,"Thought it was tasty, but it didnt blow me away. It poured very nice, nice lasting head on it. I just found it lacking something.","Davie, Florida, USA","rbod"
1194,"2008-05-29",1.9,"So the vaunted Dogfish Head finally makes it out to California. The only ways Ive ever had the opportunity to try this brand of beer is either at tastings or via trades. Aside from the World Wide Stout, which I thought was damned tasty, the rest of the DFH beers Ive had have been really underwhelming. The 90 minute was no different. 

As far as DIPA/IIPA, this is just a mockery. Nothing about this beer says its a DIPA. Instead, what it tells me is its some kinda of American Strong Ale or a barleywine. But no way in hell is this an DIPA. Its just not. And the bottle I had was pretty damned fresh...bottled 3/24/2008. So its only about 2 months old. And to top it off, they are selling this stuff for $11.99 for a 4-pack?!?!? What a joke. 

The beer pours out a burnt orange color, almost copperish. It has a nice creamy two finger thick head, and thats about where the kindness ends. The aroma is doughy, a bit of cookie and light toasted grain, perfumey and thats it. I got no semblance of hops in the nose at all. No pine, no citrus, no herbs....just...zip. Flavor really sweet with nothing to balance it out. Syrupy comes to mind, like drinking some kind of beer infused with corn syrup. There is an imbalance of hops, but it goes the other way. Instead of being over-the-top in mouth numbing bitterness, its subtle to the point of being almost missed. I just dont get this beer. There are tons of other top-shelf DIPAs available for a fraction of the price (White Knuckle, Maximus, Hopslam, Ruination, Hercules, Hopsickle, etc) why would anyone waste their time, money and liver on this? I fail to see the fascination with Dogfish Head. I think a 2.3 for this beer is being VERY kind, and the only reason it receives this was because of the appearance. It should receive between a 1.5 and a 1.8 in all honesty.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

3.5 A: Dark orange color. Two fingers of creamy head with disappointing retention and plenty of lacing.

4.5 S: Lots of citrus hops, grapefruit stands out followed by some tangerine. Malts are overshadowed by the hops, which is fine with me.

4.0 T: Not all that hoppy, but very tasty. Herbal hops mesh well with the caramel malts. This isnt what I would reach for if I wanted a really hoppy IPA, but it would be something Id want if I wanted a good beer.

4.5 M: Medium heavy body. Good amount of carbonation. Quite creamy and smooth. Well done.

4.5 D: Super drinkable, probably more drinkable due to it not having an incredibly big hoppiness.

Not surprisingly, the hops are the first thing to hit the palate, but its on the sweeter side of things...not an abrasive bitterness. Also got some fruity undertones (grapefruit?) with a solid malt background. Definitely a sweet hop aftertaste, very sticky, seems to linger.  This is certainly near the top of my list of IIPAs.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
1194,"2008-04-26",3.7,"A- Pours a deep orangey red with a 2 finger head that fades to lacing and a small frothy topping.

S- Smells sweet and very piney, pretty characterstic of a DIPA, nothing too out of the ordinary but solid none the less.

T- tastes of black liquorice, subdued piney hoppy tones, hints of alcohol.

M- A bit thick for my liking but it complements the taste well. Medium carbonation.

D- This is a sipper to be sure. I am digging the taste because of how different it is from cookie cutter DIPAs but it is thick and definitely coats your mouth. Not the most drinkable DIPA in the world but very solid.","California, USA","Lothore"
1194,"2008-04-26",4.0,"No complaints here. Hoppy aroma with the slight fruit flavor does a great job of masking the high abv. Hop balance is just right. It would take a lot of self-control to drink in 90 minutes, though.","Dublin, Pennsylvania, USA","AMN"

Perfect way to celebrate the end of the semester. Poured a crisp, clear honey color with an eggshell head. The aroma was an intense floral bouquet with a hint of sweetnes to it. Very hoppy and well balanced. Citrusy and sweet, nice bitter, warm finish. Flavor would be a ten if it were a bit more hoppy. This brew is near the top of my list.","Grand Island, New York, USA","hoptimus"
1194,"2008-04-23",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2008 Bottle. Pours a clear copper orange, with a moderate head that sticks around the entire glass and never stops with the lacing. Aroma is prominent, big time piney hops with a citrus crispness and caramel sweetness. Quite smooth for an IIPA, taste is balanced, sweet maltiness smoothly transitioning into a big piney hop body. Finishes with crisp citrus and resiny pine hops, but never fully loses the caramel sweetness. Moderately long bitter finish. Full bodied beer, syrupy, chewy, good carbonation. Excellent IIPA, superbly balanced.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

1194,"2008-04-20",4.3,"A very big IIPA. Simply delicious. Pours a honey amber with a good head, though it dissipates fairly quickly. Pine and a bit of citrus hops (grapefruit) on the nose, but the remarkable thing about this IIPA is its balance. The flavor is packed with a near-perfect balance of hops and malts. Big, thick brew, but still maintains a fresh mouthfeel - it isnt quite as syrupy as other IIPAs. Dogfish Head has a tendency for the bizarre and over-the-top, but this is an instant classic - it goes down as one of my favorites.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

1194,"2008-04-18",4.6,"After about a thousand bottles of this amazing beer, I fully admit to being totally smitten by it. All the hyperbole applies from previous reviews. And after reading nearly all of them, I cant add much. The one thing I can add is that I embrace the  variation from batch to batch. I enjoy the randomness and the surrendering to the whim of the ingredients. Lotsa grapefruit in the nose one month, not so much the next. Sometimes I find myself saying, ""A little sweeter in this batch.""  But the most important quality for me is the fact that, I LOVE it each time. A classic.","USA","specksnreds"

Flavor is about an even balance of citrus and biscuity malts.  A very good IIPA to be sure, more malt-dominated than others, but still quite good.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"

Seriously, the aroma is perfect. Flavor is fruity sweet up front fading nicely into citrus hops. Leaves a sweet stickiness behind that tempts you to take another sip. Which of course you will, after all, who are you to argue? Now that I think about it this beer may be the devil. The alcohol is so well hidden that this one sneaks up on you in a hurry. I havent had one of these for so long I should be ashamed of myself...let me pour another...I dont think its wise to keep the devil bottled up in the fridge.

Sugary and earthy soggy aromas.  Full bodied and HUGE!  An explosion of alcohol and hops.  Solid effervescence.  The bitterness is like KAPOW!  Tingling and sticky.  Touch bready character.  Big zesty acidity.  Hits all parts of the tongue.  The malts take a backseat to the assaulting hops.  Caramel and grapefruity flavors.  Estery undertones.  Big complex and aggressive.

1194,"2008-04-15",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2010 Bottle at the GBBF 2009. Lovely, inviting pine aroma but theres a sharpness to it. It has a depth of flavour but its tipping to the unbalanced side. Earthy start, bitter throughout, but a peak of sweetness at the end. The booze really comes through and is a touch overpowering.","Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","RPillsbury"

1194,"2008-04-08",4.5,"It poured a thick, cloudy orange and smelled supepr hoppy with a mix of pine and citrus. It was full of body and flavorful.

1194,"2008-04-08",3.8,"Bottle. A hazy amber beer with no head. The aroma is grassy and hoppy, while the flavor is sweet with primary notes of alcohol as well as lighter notes of hops leading to a very dry end.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","CaptBier"
1194,"2008-04-07",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2010 Re-rate 6/14/08. Nice copper color with a off-white head and some really nice lacing. The aroma is fruity with hops but not over powering. Sweet malts, a bit candy-like, with grapefruit hops. Some bitterness but the hops are relatively tame for the style. Easy drinking. This is a nice beer but could use stronger hops with more bitterness to make it a top Imperial IPA. Re-rate 1/8/09. I still find this beer pretty good but every time I have it now I am less enthused with it. I just cant put this in with the top tier of IIPAs. The pour generates a nice fluffy head, the beer laced well. The aroma is fruity, tropical-like, with some hops but the entire scent is mild. This tastes very sweet, too sweet, lots of fruity character, with the hops tilting towards a sour grapefruit but not nearly the sharp hop bite it should have. Hard to imagine me getting this again in the near future. Again, its good enough but if Im going for a big hoppy IIPA there are so many better choices. To be honest Im probably still rating this a tad high based on reputation.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"
1194,"2008-04-06",4.1,"Orange color.  Massive aroma of floral/citrus hops and some caramel malt.  The flavor is surprisingly balanced - not as bitter as I expected which.  There is a very smooth mouth feel with a dry finish.  The best IIPA Ive had.","Orinda, California, USA","haggis03a3"
1194,"2008-04-05",3.5,"Bottled. Pours an Amber coppery color but extremely clear with a medium head. Smell is......hoppy. As in Im sitting in a hops flower garden.   Taste is bitter, of course, but not as bad as it could possibly be.","New York, USA","Maverick34"
1194,"2008-04-04",3.9,"12 oz bottle courtesy of Linus stick. This one pours a rich translucent copper color with a small white head. The aroma has a big citrus character with grapefruit and lemons. The flavor is hops forward with biter grapefruit in the forefront, filling in the sides are caramel and candied oranges. The mouthfeel is full and satisfying. The finish was just a bit short, or perhaps I was just expecting it to be longer. Overall: Ive been waiting a long time to try this one, thanks Linus. A great IPA","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

A well balanced mix of citrus (grapefruit), grassy hops, and maybe a touch of alcohol. A nice clean smell.  The palate is erfectly balanced considering this hop explosion. Again, a nice dosage of citrus. You finally pick up the alcohol towards the end. An all around great brew. The hops are there but not overdone.

1194,"2008-03-13",4.1,"12 oz. Bottle.  Pours a deep ruddy orange color with a medium white head.  Aroma is crisp, with some citrus character and that classic dogfish grapefruitish hop signature.  Hop flavor is upfront in this beer and has a heavy tongue buckling resinous character that I love.  Palate is incredibly well balanced with a strong malt profile that holds up to the hops and yet somehow refrains from exhibiting that syrupy quality that dooms many IIPAs.  Finish displays some bitterness and just the right touch of alcohol warmth.  From a brewery that makes some excellent beers, this is one of their best.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"
1194,"2008-03-13",4.0,"A very good IIPA by DFH. The malt to hop ratio is almost perfect in this brew. The nice juicy hop flavors are more present in the flavor then on the nose, but flavor is definitely most important. Pours a great looking slightly cloudy sunburst color with decent head. The palate is absolutely perfect, not to syrupy and thick, but not too puny and thin. Certainly one of the better IIPAs out there. I could definitely drink these all nght long.","Wheat Ridge, Colorado, USA","MrEcted1"

1194,"2008-03-10",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2008 On a Randall at the Blind Tiger NYC: Aroma: Thick resinous hop character. Malt is juicy and lush.
Apppearance: Amber/orange almost no head retention.
Flavour: Big grassy hop character, like biting into a pine cone and a graprefruit rind. Big alcoholic zap which lingers in the mouth.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, thin carbonation, resinous and alcoholic.
Overall: Big thick and rich but very drinkable. A dangerous beer with lots of hop flavour and alcohol character to thin it out and keep it from being cloying.","Quebec, CANADA","aerosol999"

Flavor is the same, very full and complex hops but the bitterness is subdued by the sweet maltiness. Finishes with lingering remnants of the hops but again, the bitterness is not sharp or unpleasant at all. I was told that once you try the 90 minute, you can never go back to the 60.

ABV: 9%

Purchased at: Circle
Consumed on: 02.04.08

first impression: Bubbly, frothy thick head, active, with great aroma that permeates.

Color, depth: A crisp amber with great depth and variation. Magnificent color with clarity. A beautiful beer. A definite change in color throughout the glass.
Belgian lace, legs: A head to be proud of, and the lace hangs nicely. Lots of foam.

Aroma: Smell is enticing and allows you to taste from a distance.

Hoppiness, bite: Knocks you over. Almost burns your palate. If I didnt love hops, I couldnt drink it. I love hops and it delivers in droves.
Maltiness, flavor: Lots of foamy flavor - malt undertones, but second to the hops without a choice.

Weight: Weight is good, but not overly heavy.
Mouthfeel: Airy, bubbles and air everywhere. A little bit chewy, somehow, despite its clarity.

second impression: A hefty buzz after one 12 oz beer. Its remarkable, in its hops, flavor, and color. Lace is the richest Ive tested so far.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

1194,"2008-01-31",4.6,"A great IPA.  Quite possibly the best I have ever had.  Hops assault your nose as soon as the bottle is opened.  The hops seep out even more as the beer is poured into a glass.  The color is a nice light copper.  A good two finger head that is a slight tan is left on top.  The flavor explodes as it hits your mouth with huge amounts of florally and citrusy hops.  It ends on a light malt flavor that does not affect the hop characters that are left in your mouth when finished.  Quite smooth going down the throat albeit nicely carbonated.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","SlayerofBeers"

1194,"2008-01-29",4.4,"An extreme IPA, the Dogfish Head 90 minute has one of the most amount of hops youll ever find in a beer (until you try the 120 minute IPA, of course). However, this hoppy flavor is largely hidden/balanced perfectly by the high alcohol level. As a result, its actually a hint of a sweet beer, with more of a hoppy aftertaste. If you really want to taste the hops, take a bite of a bread before drinking. This will hide the alcohol flavor and really allow the hops to come out.

Taste and mouthfeel are not subtle.  Citrus is strong and sweet malt is present.  Your mouth you are grabbed by the power of hops!  I dont think it is balanced with hops very strong.  Malt helps to counter giving a sweetness to prevent the bitterness from being too much, but hops rule here.

1194,"2008-01-13",4.2,"Pours a lightish amber with quite small head, eventually subsiding into nothing more than a veneer. Aroma was about as hoppy as one could possibly imagine. All other senses were shut down to accommodate for such a powerful blast. Flavor was like no other IPA Ive ever experienced. The massive quantities of hops were quite notable, but the malt content was exceptionally higher than I expected, and seemed to balance out the hops to create a smooth feeling. This in no way detracts from the hops, however, as they make themselves known throughout. Alcohol content is goes completely unnoticed despite its rather high 9%, as the mind is too focused on the hop assault. Mouth feel is typical of the average pale ale, but due to the higher than normal malt presence, it feels slightly richer than one would expect. This beer is just plain excellent, and undoubtedly lives up to its reputation as one of the best Imperial IPAs out there.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

Something metallic-like in the aroma as well, but nothing too offensive.  Ill begin the flavor portion of my rating by saying Im not a hophead.  Mostly sweet, citrus hops up front...lemony and orangey, with some piney hop flavors later on the palate.  More sweet on the palate than most IIPAs, there is definitely a malt backbone to this drink, which is a very good thing in my book.  This beer is a great example of how you can use an abundance of hops but still make it palatable and not extraordinarily bitter.  There is the telltale bitterness on the end, but it is not too strong.  I found myself leaving with a slightly sweet flavor.  I came at this beer with a tentative approach and left very happy.  Palate is very pleasant as well...somewhat thick while not overpowering.  The emptier my glass gets, the more I enjoy this!  Ill try most IPAs/IIPAs once...this one Ill go back to! 

Quick addendum on 4/19/08 - Why did I give this a 3/5 on appearance...nice off-white head that settles with wonderful lacing...upping to a 4/5...also havent noted the metallic notes in future bottles, though dont see a big need to up the Aroma rating...","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"

Appearance: The color was a slightly reddish amber with almost no head at all.

Aroma: There is a moderate hop aroma with a very slight citrus hint.

Taste: For a beer with 90 IBUs, it is surprisingly smooth. There is the initial bite from the hops, but that quickly fades do a more subdued flavor. It does leave an aftertaste from the hops, but it isnt heavy.

Mouthfeel: Light to moderate carbonation, but it tastes heavier than it looks. No doubt the ""ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley"" has something to do with that.

Gentle steady carbonation yeilds thin ring of head.  I believ this is due to the fact that the bubbles are scared of the hops and only dare to travel in small numbers. Surpisingly mellow.  I can not believe they mentioned eating snails with this beer.  Anyone who eats snails has a serious lack for their self preservation...snails carry numerous nasty diseases that even this beer would not kill. those boys should have their heads examined...for brain wasting nematodes!   (often found on snails).  Anyway....my snail tirade aside...Thanks to the Slob for sending this one my way.","Hippetown East, New York, USA","coldbrewky"

After experiencing the aroma the taste is even better. It has a nice hop bite that is blended with a slight sweetness and a mild background alcohol taste. It ends on the slightly sweet side with a finish where all flavors stay on the palate for a long time. GREAT!!!!!!!","Florida, USA","gpekar"

Now here is an IPA with substance - this is a pleasurable assault on the tastebuds!   I guess that is the purpose of an Imperial IPA.  It starts out smooth and malty sweet, with a hint of herbs, then shifts to a forceful, hopped up finish.  I am also revising this upward in 2009 (from 20007).

It pours a clear medium amber with light carbonation, marked viscosity, and some hop lace.  The flavor is rather sweet with fruitcake notes.  The finish is much like pink grapefruit with a slight astringency and some residual sweetness.   This is an accomplished barleywine rather than a double IPA, quite possibly the best American barleywine currently made.  P. S.

Also spicy and vegetal (especially cardamom and squash). Bitter coffee been flavors from the hops rather than the malts (unlike a dry stout). Somewhat reminiscent of a dry sherry.

It really pleases the mouth, and the finish is primarily dry, a little fruit lingers, and surprisingly unbitter. Well, its bitter, but it is so nicely set off with fruit aspects, like apricot all of a sudden. This is one of those ales that just demands full attention for savoring.

Finish is a little cloying with sticky orange blossom honey. Im not getting the 90 IBUs in this one, if anything Id search for more bitterness. Its great though, makes me lick my lips.

1194,"2007-08-09",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2011 Bottle. A clear pale to medium amber beer, with a large, frothy, lacing, mostly lasting white head. The aroma is lightly malty (caramel), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, pine), with notes of alcohol and a slight off note (perhaps butter).The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, syrupy/thick texture, lively carbonation, long finish with moderate to heavy bitterness, moderately to heavily alcoholic. In my opinion it looks very appealing, but the other aspects are average for the style. Quite pleasant but straightforward aroma with a buittery hint, overly sweet flavor and sticky palate with a boozy finish. Overall Ok, but I remembered it as one of the finest DIPAs available.

1194,"2007-07-23",4.3,"I bought this at my grocery store to conclusively determine whether or not Im a ""hop head"" and, just so you can gauge my input appropriately, Ill start by admitting that Im not. Poured clear amber with a satisfying, large, billowing head that leaves a fair amount of exquisite lace (but that couldve been my less-than-conservative pour). The strongest elements of the aroma were grapefruit and pine needles. The power of the two of those were overwhelming (in a good way) to me and made it difficult to detect anything else in the nose. The first thing to hit me in the taste was a syrupy sweetness with a spiciness to it that brought the flavor closer to a date (or ""drupe"") than to the maple syrup you put on pancakes. This slides down the tongue with a thick, syrupy consistency until it turns into a flavorful, hoppy warmth at the back of the mouth with mild-moderate bitterness. All of this is surrounded by a pine freshness with citrus notes (the citrus could be compared to grapefruit, if taken into account with the ending bitterness). Its a funny thing: Im drinking a second bottle/glass as I write this and can no longer remember what turned me off to it the first time. Maybe I am a ""hop head"" after all.

The flavor is full of bittersweet pineapple hops and just enough malt to hold it together.  Like all DFH beers, it has a wonderfully smooth, creamy mouthfeel, despite some generous carbonation.

Medium/full-bodied and creamy-soft it finishes only slightly bitter. This brew is very balanced for a beer weighing in at 90 IBU. They must use a boatload of malt to get such an amazing integration of flavors. The taste is a sweet toasted caramel malt front with a fruity hop finish, but I use that oversimplification primarily because its so difficult to pull out individual flavors.  It isnt really very bitter at all until a few seconds after the swallow. Then a nice bitterness sets in at the back sides of your tongue.

Flavor is a bit disappointing: not so rich and very soft, but I give it a rating this high because of the wonderful and long-lasting finish of hops and bitterness.

Slight malt, medium alchohol aroma.  Pale orange color.  Guey, thick citrus hop bomb, balanced with tons of malty sweetness.  The beer clings to the side of the glass, trying to climbs its way out, as I swirl it in my glass.  Then slowly falls back leaving a trail of fine bubbles.

1194,"2007-07-08",4.2,"Appearance: Pours a clear copper body with a small, creamy white head.

Smell: Lavish, rich caramel maltiness with pronounced accents of pine, juicy citrus fruits, and dried pineapple. 

Taste: The malt and hops march side-by-side along the tongue with lush sugary caramel sweetness and pineapple juice garnished with pine needles. Sweet-bitter finish, with the bitterness enduring into the aftertaste. The purported 90 IBUs can hardly be felt what with all this rich, malty sweetness within. The ABV, though apparent, thankfully isnt glaring.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Quite warming.

Looks amazing.  Aside from Guinness, the 1st 5 rating Ive given for appearance.  Rich golden, amber color with a thick frothy, creamy white head that held up a long time and left great lacing.  Smell is very hoppy obviously, juicy apricot, and light floral fruitiness.  Intense and great nose.  Taste is quite hoppy, juicy apricot like, bitter, drying, and floral.  Honestly, I was a bit afraid of this beer, not especially being a fan of regular IPAs even, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Still very hoppy, but not as bitter as I feared somehow.  Smelled, and looked delicious, and granted was bitter, but I actually liked it somehow, even not being a fan big bitterness.  Drinking it fairly cold, and not letting it mellow out all over my tongue controlled some of the intense hoppiness, while allowing to enjoy some of the big flavors and delicious smells.  Aftertaste was some residual bitterness, along with some pleasant honeysuckle sweetness.  I was quite pleasantly surprised and would actually get this again occasionally.  Not a session brew, but something Id look forward to when craving something of this style.  This will likely broaden the types of beers Ill try in the future.


RERATE 12-23-07
Pours a brilliant amber with medium lasting beige head in a snifter.  Smell is strong sweet and fruity hops.  Flavor is sweet, yet highly hopped and well bittered.  Fruity and piney hops in the taste with some hints of alcohol showing but not detracting much.  Much sweeter and less hopped than I remember my 1st time having this beer, but then again, that was one of my first experiences with a double IPA and it was quite a shock to my senses.  A touch warming in the chest.  Now I find this quite drinkable and nice, whereas before it was tasty but too hoppy.  A bit syrupy body.  Nice double IPA for sure.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

                  Extremely long finish of pure hop, pine, and tannin. This beer 
                  is extremely drinkable. Almost too much so. Hopefully my local 
                  bar (Bostons Bistro) will have a go at Randall The Enamel 
                  Animal.

                  Would have loved to try a draught 120 minute with this. Would 
                  have also been interesting to do a side by side of a regular 
                  Draught 90 min and the Randall 90 min. 

                  Conclusion, if you know of a place thats not over a 2 hour 
                  drive from your homestead (unless you get a hotel) stop and 
                  try this unique concept in beer history. Well worth it.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","mcallister"
1194,"2007-06-16",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2010 Poured a deep golden amber color with a nice white head that left good lacing in the glass.  The aroma is all hops at first.  Big fruity hops with some pine and flowery hops as well.  You get a hint of the malts as well.  The taste follows the same with a lot of citrus hops like grapefruit, pine, and orange and lemon zest in there as well.  The sweetness follows next with the nice malt profile that this beer has.  It has the sweet citrus taste with some raisins as well.  The malts blend together with the monster hops almost perfectly.  Full bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a lengthy, bitter finish. The alcohol leaves a warming feeling as it goes down. This is a good beer with its only detractor being just a touch on the boozy side.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
1194,"2007-06-15",4.0,"12 oz bottle:  A big fruity hop aroma for starters, pine, somewhat of a malt aroma, but for the most part this is all hops.  Very nice.

Taste consists of nice bitter and fruity hops that consists of grapefruit notes, pine, and other citrus like lemon and orange peel are intermingled.  Some subtle malt characteristics also in there.

1194,"2007-06-13",3.7,"Quite light amber with a big solid head. Surprisingly malty aroma, with caramel, grain and some dried fruit - the hop notes are grassy and citrus. Dry and bitter but with a giant malty mouthfeel. The bitterness has a tobacco-like astringent touch which isnt bad at all. Some alcohol.
After being underwhelmed by the bitterness I checked the date to see if the journey across the Atlantic could have killed it. But it was bottled in April, and I was disappointed in May and in June. Im just not a fan of really malty and sweet IIPAs. But store it three years and Ill probably love it as a barleywine.","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"

The deep golden color and thick head hint at something special.  The smell is pure citrus hops.  A hint of caramel and spices perhaps as well.  The thing that separates this for me from others like this is that the taste delivers on the promise of the aroma.  Hints of tangerine, herbs, and some sweet candy linger on the tongue for a long time.  It is just a remarkably well balanced beer that goes well with a nice grilled meal, cheese, or by itself.

Out of the bottle, into a snifter: it was a mostly-transparent dark orange with a lasting spongy white head.  Aroma, strangely enough, was exactly like a big red sucker (syrupy sweet with artificial cherry), and with some pine and grapefruit in the background.  Sticky mouthfeel with sweet flavors that reflect the aroma, and a heavy malt character to balance out the amount of hops.","Juneau, Alaska, USA","leeburg"

1194,"2007-05-28",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2008 Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA - Draught through ""Randall The Enamel Animal"" (Cascade hops)
Date: 4/26/2007
Event: Dogfish Head at Dilly Deli. 
Location: Dilly Deli - Wines & Gourmet.
Serving: 16 oz draught.
Tasting Notes
Aroma: Fresh hops and grapefruit with some light orange and citrus as well.
Appearance: Clear golden color with a mild level of carbonation.  Lasting puffy/whipped foamy off-white head.
Flavor: Toasted and sugary malt with lots of grapefruit and citrus hops.  The bitterness level is moderate and seems less hoppy and bitter than the bottled version.
Palate: Medium body; smooth and mellow.
Overall: The hop-back is definitely a fun and interesting gimmick, but I actually think that the 90 Minute from a bottle or better yet, just straight, un-adulterated 90 Minute on draught is better...
Rating:  7  4  8  4  17 = 4.

2008 Vintage
9/29/2008:  Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA is the color of an apricot with a coppery tone.  It has a frothy to foamy beige head and low level of carbonation.  A sugary cornucopia of fruit/tropical fruit (orange, grapefruit, apricot, pineapple, mango, peach, etc.) fill the nose.  The flavor is a wonderfully balanced combination of sweet, toasty caramel malt and mixed fruit in heavy syrup.  Its strong, yet delicate and sweet, yet bitter (moderately so and then some).  This beer has a medium to medium-full body that just slightly syrupy and goes down so damn easily!  This is an awesome Imperial IPA that is so easily sessionable that its completely dangerous, but yet I just cant stop!!!
Comparison to DFH 60 Minute IPA...  Sweeter and stronger with more citrus, more caramel than toffee, more bitterness.  IT is slightly darker in color and a thicker, more syrupy body.  Slightly sticky and completely addictive!

 Nice creamy IPAish ale. Really sweet malt dominates - hops really are more like backup singers in a malt ensamble drink. A little apricot and pear characterize the slightly spicey malt body, which is nicely complex.

1194,"2007-05-11",4.4,"Rated 2/3/06:  WOW, this is one amazing brew! Sampled a 12 ounce bottle which I poured into a merlot glass. The aroma was an intense mixture of hops, sweet malts, and more hops. The bitterness of the aroma lead me to believe that this beer may be too much for me. In the glass this beer is a wonderful amber color with ample head and very nice lacing. Once I took my first taste I was immediately blown away by the flavor of this beer. The hops were not overpowering like I had expected, in fact they hit you at first but mellow out to give way to some nice malt flavors. This beer is extremely high in alcohol content but you wouldnt know by the flavor which hides it well. I could definately see myself enjoying a few of these and then sliding back into my comfy chair with a very nice mellow buzz.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

Then I tasted it.  This was truly one of those ""OMG"" moments when it comes to beer, its just exceptional.  All the promises offered in the aroma come through, somehow treading the line of heavy hopping without shocking the palate.

1194,"2007-04-06",4.4,"Pours a brilliant,  golden orange with a medium-sized, light tan head. The aroma is mesmerizing - it is extremely malty, but not in a one-dimensional way: caramel, toffee, fruit, karos syrup, all combined. There are also some grassy hops in the aroma, too - though not as much as Id expect from continuous hop-infusion. The taste is bliss: the tingly carbonation prefaces a deep, bitter-sweet, strong malt and hop duo. The tip of the tongue detects some bitterness. The middle of the tongue picks up more hop flavor that playfully balances the  heavy malt backbone. On the back of the tongue, the hop flavor and bitterness gain considerable ground against the sweet malt. There is some fruit flavors in the middle and end of the beer, but overall the taste is very clean. The finish is somewhat dry from hops, though feels full-bodied in texture. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit too bubbly - but swirling the glass to release more carbon dioxide fixes that right up. After that, it feels creamy, sudsy, and medium in body. Overall - what an awesome beer!","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

1194,"2007-03-23",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2007 Not what I expected but still a treat. From the bottle. First time I had one of Dogfishes IPAs. Very smooth and sweet with many hints of citrus and herbs.

Aroma is excellent balance of dark-fruit malt and zesty hop. Flavor is dirty, earthy molasses, honey, tea leaf, alcohol, oak and peppery citrus. Medium body is mostly smooth, a little tingly but not nearly as bitter as I expected. Slightly sweet entry is extremely well-balanced at the end.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

Grassy pine smell evident of the painstaking hopping process of this brew.  Suprisingly light and nuetral on the palate considering the strong aroma.

Pour was an average pale copper color with a one-finger foamy white head that receded quickly.  Some nice lacing hung around for most of the glass.  The aroma was sweet malt, mild citrus and nice floral hops.  The flavor was an incredibly well balanced blend of sweet roasted malt, grapefruit, floral and piney hops.  Velvety mouthfeel with soft carbonation.  Not a hophead beer like I expected.  More refined.  Like a grownups DIPA.  All kinds of beers can punch you in the face with a blast of hops.

Flavor is initially moderately sweet and lightly acidic and finishes with heavy bitter, acetic, lightly acidic and sweet flavor.  Very hoppy beer with short finish that didnt linger as some have noted.

Smell is very hoppy, floral notes, as well as citrus, overall very crisp and refreshing. Flavor is very bitter, the alcohol is nicely balanced and is only strongly evident in the finish. The hops hit right from the beginning but there is also a malty sweetness. The hops soon win out and you are left with strong hops bitterness assualting the palate.

1194,"2007-03-04",4.1,"12oz. Bottle

90 Minute poured a beautiful dark orange. An aggressive pour produced a 1+ finger head. The head was creamy white along the edges of the glass with moderate bubbles throughout the the center. Decent lacing. Big carbonation bubbles rising from the center of my snifter.

Smell is mostly hops but there is a solid malt backbone. A ton of floral hops along with tropical fruit. Pineapple, mango. I also pick up bubblegum every now and then. Strong hop scent. Makes my mouth water.

Now on to the most important aspect of it all. The taste is up there with some of the best IIPAs Ive had. The flavors are exactly like the smell. A solid caramel backbone but the main point is the juicy fruity hops. I was expecting more bitterness but the end is a good balance with only a slight bitterness. As it warms I can feel a warming alcohol in my nose and throat.

Medium bodied. Coats my mouth nicely as I drink. Moderate carbonation tingle on my tongue. 

Drinkability is good. It would be a little higher but the alcohol comes out more as it warms.

12 oz bottle, Brew Urban Cafe in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Bottled on 12/20/2010. Pour is hazed golden orange with a 1/2 inch white head that falls quick. Aroma is honey and floral hop sweetness, along with some resin and caramel malt. Mostly about the honey sweet. Taste is sweet honey and caramel malt, along with a bright citrus resin. Decent balance, some booze showing through in the back. Sweetness cloys ever so slithly as it warms, though this serves to minimize the alcohol some. Palate is medium to heavy bodied, coats the mouth a bit and lingers with honey floral sweetness. (7,4,8,3,15 - 3.7).

Orange is primary, with a grapefruit edge.  Just slightly acidic.  The flavor mellows as it progresses, but lasts.  For a high ""alcohol by volume"" beer (9%), there is surprisingly little alcohol flavor on the finish.

The balance continues in the flavor.  The beer is centered around the hops, as any Imperial IPA should be, and they dominate, but there is an underlying malty flavor that is firm and provides much of the body, but is less assertive than the hops.  Finish is all clean hops.  An excellent brew.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","mnbeerguy"

1194,"2007-01-28",3.6,"(Boittle brought back from the East Coast by a friend) Very heavy body, but then again what to expect from something at 9% alc?? Its supposed to be dry-hopped, but not a very heavy nose of hops in my glass. Color is cross between dark golden and orange, leaning more to the former. Nice hop charactor. Yes, there are hops there like there should be with an IPA, but its NOT an overly bitter hop charactor. (Note to self, start experimenting with Warrior, Simcoe and Amarillo hops!!!!). Quick pouring head, which disappated pretty quickly. Nice palate. Hops stay in aftertaste, albeit VERY light. Just enough to remember what you drank, but not enough to make you wait to take another sip. Make sure this beer is not too overly chilled. When I first poured it it was a bit on the cold side, but after letting it warm up in my glass the hops open up a bit. Id buy it again, assuming it ever gets out here in the West Coast (the neck lable DOES have CA CASH VALUE on it so they must be planning to some day!).","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

Initial flavor of deep, crisp hops, but not so much to be offensive-youre not chewing on them. Has a sweet, grassy, somewhat nutty barley flavor on the back end to balance it out. Long sweet finish. I am not usually an IPA fan, but Dogfish knows how to make them right, this is one you can easily enjoy as a sesson brew.

The extra half-hour does wonders for this beer.","Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, USA","jj21"
1194,"2007-01-18",4.1,"12 oz. bottle.  Wow hops!  Pours a golden copper with white foam which diminishes to a very thin lacing.  Aroma is deep amounts of citrus and fruity hops.  Initial taste is citrusy with something like apricot seed and mouthfeel is incredibly smooth with alcohol not noticable until the end, which has a arming effect.  The hops are what really stand out obviously, but after a few sips the sweet malt emerges and lingers along with the hops which is now diminishing but balances out very well.  I dont know if Id call this the best beer in America, but its certainly the best IPA Ive ever had.","Wonju, SOUTH KOREA","beedman"

A really distinctive DIPA:  cant think of any Ive had that taste quite like it.  Ive had many bottles over the past year and my only complaint is that taste its a bit *too* floral for it to rank with my very favorite DIPAs (Russian River, Great Divide), but I think this is a more interesting beer than, say, Stone ruination.

The taste does not let you down- this is medicine for the hopaholics! Yet it is also well-supported by a solid toffee base. Consistency is almost sirupy, but very appropriate. Lovely, but dangerous!","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
1194,"2007-01-15",4.5,"Pours a clear, deep, amber - the color of apple juice - with less than an inch of tightly packed white head. The foam quickly recedes to a ring around the glass. Spotty lace. Strong spicy and floral hop aroma from the moment the cap is popped. Lovely aroma in the glass.

Hops, sure, but what gets me is the malt. Prominent malt with a lot of sweetness. OK the hops are fantastice. More spicy hops with a lot of tangy bitterness. Rounded out by a good deal of alcohol. Full body, full flavor, wonderfully hoppy - yet smooth. Nice carbonation combines with the hops to bite the tongue. Hops stays in the aftertaste (for a long long time) along with the alcohol.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

Smell is malty. Taste is moderately acidic/sweet, with a nice malty overtone.  Do also taste a slight citrus/floral flavor.  

Initally hits the palate with the strong malt/pungent alcohol combo.  Finish is very light and leaves almost no lingering aftertaste.  Almost seems as if the high alcohol content washes any aftertaste away.  

Overall, very enjoyable.  I like, very much!","Arizona, USA","BrewManchu"

The only other dogfish ive had before this was the Raisin brew, and im not a fan of that one, so I was skeptical about this one, despite its reputation.

1194,"2007-01-02",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2014 First slow and deliberate swig out of the bottle was spectacular, definitely an explosive scream of ""quality"" in comparison to the Summit IPAs that Ive had a number of times, although I do detect a fairly sharp taste of alcohol (which went away the more I drank, probably because of the buzz). Halfway through and Im buzzin well and a second might be out of the question on account of high ABV and I have to work in the early morn. Less appealing the more I drink but Ill definitely get another 4-pack in the future. Price: $10.99 plus tax for a four-pack. (Dare I take poetic license and deem four-packs ""four-bangers""?

Big west coast hop aroma, but quite a bit of malt in there as well, to balance.  Alcohol is there too, lurking.  Results in a sort of candied aroma, which continues in the flavour.  Grassy, sticky hops, and a far sweeter mouthfeel than I was expecting.  The alcohol remains hidden in the mid-palate and then right near the end of the finish you kind of get ""burned"".  Near the end of the glass, the alcohol becomes veeeeeerrrry apparent.  Much maltier than other dIPAs Ive had, but it works.

1194,"2006-12-14",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2006 Bottle, from mug. A hazy, golden-amber with a fluffy, pale-yellow head leaving stratified lace. Aroma of apricot, citrus and spruce, with caramel emerging as it sits. Full bodied, with an oily yet creamy texture and soft, smooth carbonation. The flavor is dominated by potent hops, which are carried to the sinuses and vaporized with the alcohol. A strong foundation of malt breaks through the intensity of the hops and cannot be denied. The finish is big and bitter, but not overly dry. Clearly, this is a world-class beer: every aspect has a compelling counter argument. Sensational. I feel small in the presence of this beer.","USA","SwillNoMore"

Thick malts on the tongue, honey, green apple and orange.  Syrupy rich mouthfeel, but there isnt the searing bitter finish that I sort of anticipated.  Rather theres a hint of something sour that is vaguely unpleasant.  I liked it quite a bit but its nothing too enlightening.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1194,"2006-12-11",3.5,"12 oz bottle, via Secret Santa 2006.  Pours a clear bright copper colored body under a fizzy and foamy one finger white head.  Some very light lacing remained.  Aroma is actually fairly light on the hops, just a light floral note with a touch of grapefruit.  The malt really takes center stage.  Thick and almost candy like with touches of marshmellow, caramel, and toffee.  Pretty well balanced flavor for an IIPA, moderately bitter with some bright citrusy notes.  Alot of sweetness remains though, mostly toffee-like, and a little too candy like again.  Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied, lightly syrupy in texture with pleasant soft carbonation.  Finishes a little sticky and cloying.  Overall, this was pretty decent, but way down on my list of IIPAs.

1194,"2006-12-10",2.5,"I will be damned for this review, any credibility gained as a beer jester lost forever as hordes of angry beerophiles charge screaming at my doorstep to demand my head. It was my fault for drinking the beer before it reached ideal temperature (drink this warm or youll be sorry,) but even so, this beer didnt really interest me even at its best. The head is minimal, but thick. The color is crystal clear apple juice. The nose on this one is the dealbreaker - the 90 minute IPA smells distinctly of tuna fish. As one who dislikes tuna fish, I could not abide this. While this odious flavor does not carry over strongly in the flavor of the beer, it lingers JUST enough to sour my appetite. This beer doesnt have much overall identifiable flavor, but whats there is sour and unpleasant.

Sweet, citrusy notes take a backseat. Quite a bit of alcohol shows through in the middle and especially the finish. Again, the malts make themselves known throughout, tempering the intense hoppiness and keeping them from being overwhelming. This is a big beer, and very good.

Medium-to-full, chewy mouthfeel: a nice upfront citrus hop presence, plenty of Simcoe piney notes surrounding it; with generous amounts of sweet maple syrup and honey to keep things well-balanced.

1194,"2006-11-02",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2006 The beer pours orangey-brown. Some might well call it copper, but its not as lustrous. Were presented with a solid off-white head showing good size and retention and even leaving some lacing, which is always nice.

The first aromas are purely hop resins. I love this piney stuff, and its a pleasant surprise, since I know whats coming next. When the resins recede, the citrus hops take over. Oranges and lemons fall from the sky. Alcoholic pepperiness is there, too, but no malt aromas at this point.

The beer is full-bodied with a bright acidity. It is not dry - there are some non-fruit sugars here. Dont get me wrong. The beer is not sweet. There is a sturdy malt balance to all the hop power, but frankly its a little boring. Cereal and grain and, to be generous, cookies. Alcohol is overt and ever-present. The finish carries its slight burn and a pleasant bitterness.

As the experience goes on, I receive impressions of tobacco and raisins, There are glimpses of toasted grain, but by now the lemony citrus has completely taken over and is driving us home.

I thought at first that this beer smelled like a plant store, but my girlfriend pinpointed it and said it smelled like snapdragons.  Tastes sweet upfront still, sugary and earthy, well balanced with hops and snapdragon taste.  Texture is smooth while the beer is pretty thick.  Medium carbonation.  Finishes unexpetedly nutty/brown, and in this version very planty.  Excessively herby, and wonderful.  A bit cloying though after a while.  I like the sweetness, and the finish blends into the flavors incredibly well.  With the added plantstore-like flavors, this beer had a whole 4-dimension of flavor.

Smothering aroma of sweet buttery malt with diesel aftertones; surprisingly subdued lemon and peach hop presence. First sip reveals the unexpected taste of vanilla poundcake. Subsequent sensations of anise, maple syrup, and resiny hop. This barley behemoth torques through with the finesse of an avalanche. Seriously sweet and merely mildly bitter. Sticky palate, as thick as paint. An utter failure as a hop-forward concotion; definitely a dessert beer. Pecan pie in a glass.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"

Its really malty sweet with caramel, orange, apricot overtones...then BANG! it hits me with a bitter, bittery, bitterness.   The only thing bothering me from the bitterness is the cloying sweetness.

1194,"2006-09-28",3.7,"Bottled. Pours a clear golden amber with a massively lacy, creamy head. Creamy medium body mild carbonation. This beer seems like it has DIPA-level malt, but only IPA-level hops which have a tough time making their way through all that malt. The net result is a tasty beer, but one that seems to be more on the barleywine end of the spectrum than on the Imperial IPA end. The aroma is dominated by pineapple with oranges, nuts and toffee behind it. Theres a big shot of toffee and pineapple in the taste, which stays sweet almost to the end, which has just enough grapefruit to clean things up. Vaguely reminiscent of orange juice with alcohol added, but not like drinking a screwdriver - if that makes any sense at all.","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"

The alcohol is high in this puppy, I can feel it half way through my glass. I wish this Dogfish head was easier to find....I paid big bucks for a 4 pk.

1194,"2006-09-05",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2014 Bottle.  Orange pour, medium-strong carbonation, short white head.  Strong citrus and grapefruit nose from all the hopping, hint at medium-strong maltiness.  Taste is a smooth wave of strong bitterness blended with lightly crisp hop notes and thick, syrupy dark maltiness, which slightly edges out the hoppiness.  Very full-bodied, even obese!  Vinous and coating.  Molasses, grape, light toasted caramel.  Id rather label this a malt bomb than a hop monster, and it takes the IPA close to Barley Wine territory.  Very dry end and aftertaste with a vivid memory of the malty experience - a decadent sipper, but really nice! [5 Sept 2006: 4.0]Re-rate bottled on 10/10/13, so not extremely fresh.  Nose is strong caramel malt and extremely oily hops, pours very clear orange with an off-white head and moderate carbonation.  Nose has this sugar dust thing going on.  Very rich in the mouth, sweet without cloy, yet powerful and somewhat alcoholic, firm bitterness, clouded with hops (positives and negative there).  I didnt realize this in past sampling, but this is clearly the attempt to imperialize the 60 min, which I originally liked less but now come to favor; this one is so much less repeatable, much more brute force in its solution than elegant.  Still, stands up to the pressures of time, and thick enough to stand up to food.  [7 Feb 2014: 3.8]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

This reminds me of a barleywine - a style that I generally have not taken well to as they tend to be too sweet for my tastes.

I liked that this tasted generously bittered, but was not uber-aggressive.  It was well balanced.  You can tell that this is a ""big"" beer, but it isnt throat- scorching like some other 9% beers.

Very good double IPA, but I think the Plinys have spoiled me.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"

Wonderful aftertaste with some fruity alchohol following up. This is my favorite IPA yet (my first Imperial though), and what I REALLY appreciate is that it is not one of those extremely bitter unripe grapefruit tasting monstrosities like some overhopped IPAs are. BALANCE is the only way I personally like an IPA, and this one has it. Overhop an IPA all you want, but give the malts equal tratment like Dogfish did here, and you have a big WINNER!

First sip was a bomb of piquant and citrusy hops, balanced perfectly by sweet malts and   leaving a trailing pleasant bitterness on the finish.  Some toastiness and alcohol warmth as well.  Became more candy-like towards the end of the glass (snifter, always!) with alcohol and hops tickling my nose. Palate was fine to slightly oily.  This was the one that first got me hooked on 2IPAs, and I always thought of it as the standard bearer of the style, at least in the East.

Strong hop backbone with citrus hints, and this one is well balanced with malts (whereas other dogfish go too much to the malts and go too sweet...they got it right in this one).

1194,"2006-08-03",4.4,"Appearance: Pours a golden orange color with a small creamy head that fades quickly. Leaves very heavy lacing coating the walls of my snifter glass.

Smell: I was expecting the hops to be too big. This beer may have gotten bigger than the 60 min but it did not get overly bitey. The smell is actually more toasted sweet malt that it is over the top pine bite. After the caramel lead off there is a bold grapefruit presence but not cloying. (coming from a non-hophead). I is very fruity like some apple and white grape were thrown in this floral bouquet.

Taste & Mouthfeel: Sweet. Smooth! Alcohol and balanced hop spice then dry finish and grapefruit aftertaste with a second wave of sugars following the tart. The moment this beer touched my lips it was instant onslaught of marvelous sugars and tingles. It is so magnificently smooth and slick it just slid across my tougher with its oily malty slickness and unless I stopped to swish it around the bitter was only presented as a mild tingle. When I held on to it for further contemplation the alcohol did show through but in nice balance with the citrus rind tartness. The aftertaste left me with a grapefruit pucker followed by more sugars coming back around for a second wave of sweetness. Brilliant!

Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. At 9% ABV it has caught up to you before you know it. I would consider it easy to drink but not sessionable.

Hope this is helpful.

Big malty flavor, big hop flavor, but not overly complex-- this is an IPA after all, a beer for drinking.  This fits right in between Dogfish Heads 60 and 90 minute IPAs; bolder than the 60 minute, but easy enough on you that you can drink it during the week.

1194,"2006-06-16",4.1,"Bottle - Poured a darkish orange-amber in color with a small whitish head that, while somewhat foamy initially,  diminished to a thin rim and light cover on the beer in the glass.  Aroma, while deliciously hoppy to start (both floral spice), there is also (surprisingly) a medium amount of malty sweetness present.  The flavor, of course, starts as pretty intense hops, but without the nasty bite that strongly hopped beers sometimes get.  This heavenly hoppiness is supoported by a more than generous amount of sweet malt that provides, perhaps, the best balanced beer I have ever had.  It all comes to a ""bitter end"", however, as the malt fades in the stretch and the hop bitterness lingers for a medium (nice) while.  I am truly impressed... this is a very excellent brew!

Tangerines, grapefruit, oranges, etc.  Very sweet.  Juicy hops.  As with too many high abv IPAs, the alcohol kills the hops bitterness.  Oily body and medium-soft carbonation.

1194,"2006-06-02",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2007 Re-rate, 7/07, after many experiences over the course of my consumption: Pours an amber to almost copper color, nice initial head for a beer of this ABV. Retention was weak, but lacing ok. The aroma was grapefruits, melons, other fruits, firm caramel and sweet malts. The flavor followed suit, definite bitterness, lots of citrus and grapefruit, touch of melons, yet balanced by a deceptively thinner than thick or sticky, yet flavorful malt presence. Odd that this thing never is sticky, nor is it hot, yet nicely malted and bittered overall. One of my favs among dIPAs. Great stuff, DFH. Original ratings: Ok, with each IPA I have, I become less and less overwhelmed by the hoppiness. I was bracing for the worst on this one, but it didnt overwhelm my tongue with hop happiness. Strong head (long lasting too) with a standard copper yellow appearance (great lacing). Nice piney and floral type taste over top of a decent malty base. Grapefruits were detectable, which is not surprising for the style. Carbonation bubbles rising to the top of the glass would made this a nice show in a heffeweizen glass (Bottle was as good, if not better, than the tap.) Re-rate: No detailed updates, but Ive had this many times, and its a fine dIPA.","","User37895"
1194,"2006-06-02",4.1,"Pours with almost no head that disappears quickly. It has a real fruity smell with a hint of hops. Almost smells like apple juice! It has several diff flavors that Ill attempt to explain.. Has a real nice bitter taste, not too much like a double IPA or something, with a slight fruity/sweet taste. Maybe more sweet than normal IPAs? Once it started to warm a little.. I tasted more bitterness. The level of alcohol in this one really kicks you in the butt if you dont drink it slow, which isnt a bad thing. Usually I think IPAs have a little to much bitterness... but I really enjoyed this one. If some of the hype drops and the price goes down.. Ill probably buy this one again.","Arlington, Texas, USA","cowboy7096"
1194,"2006-06-02",4.4,"12 oz. bottle.  Drank 5/24/06.  Super clear, light copper.  Sm. 1 cm. off-white head drops quickly to a thin layer of foam.  Eventually makes a ring of foam that leaves OK lacing.  Huge hop aroma.  Big, fruity, piney hops.  Little bit of sweetness.  Aroma actually gets less strong as it warm, which is the opposite of other beers in my experience.  Flavor - nice, high level of bitterness, but very nicely balanced by a big malt backbone.  Really well balanced.  Sweet as it hits your tongues.  Then the bitterness kicks in.  Some sweetness, a little bit of alcohol warmth, and a ton of hop flavor in the swallow - mostly piney, resiny, fruity hops - a little bit of floral.  Palate - medium to full body.  Not too much carb, a good amt.  Bitterness helps balance the body.  Perfect body for this beer / style.  Tiny bit of dryness in the finish.  Overall - Really nice IIPA.  Really well balanced.  Great aroma.  Great flavor.  If I had one complaint its that its a little too sweet.  Im sure my review is somewhat influenced by the hype surrounding this beer.

I love the hop varieties.  Not the grapefruit bomb that most big IPAs seem to be.  And not the astringently bitter ale that can also bare the moniker.

Gently swirling the brew sends sheets of large, shimmering bubbles spalshing down the sides of my snifter glass.  My initial impression of the aroma is one of mild surprise.  Instead of the powerful grapefruit and pine aromas I was expecting, my nose is greeted by a waft of honey and peach.  Springtime tulips and a touch of rye seem to be buried in there as well.  The subtleness of the aroma is a bit misleading, however, as a powerful blast of juniper needles and rosemary petals explodes across my tongue.  Heavy feeling mouthfeel, without being sticky or syrupy.  A bit of tangy orange zest, sage, and green pepper spice also seems to be coming out from behind the evergreen trees.

It just doesnt seem like anything else should squeeze through, but a lot of malt presence is there. Wonderful aroma of flowery citrus. A little sticky, but also very dry. Good head, and gorgeous golden body, but I was dissapointed by the lack of lacing. A world-class beer which has earned my admiration.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","PhysZac"

1194,"2006-03-27",4.4,"Whoa! This is a wonderful beer. It is an incredibly drinkable and remarkably tasty IPA from Dogfish Head. It is a clear dark orange color and when it is poured into a glass the wave of carbonation seems to almost hit the bottom of the glass before settling on top. Flavor is mostly of hoppy grapefruit but balanced out nice with a  barleywine-esque sweetness. This beer goes down smooth and easy so if youve drank a few while sitting be careful when you stand up because that 9% definatly hits you in the right places.","Littleton, Massachusetts, USA","jaw61103"
1194,"2006-03-27",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of HogTownHarry. Pours a cloudy bubbly amber with an average size diminishing foamy white head. Aroma is a nicely balanced blend of floral hops and malt -- simple but downright pleasant. The flavours a touch watery and not as hoppy as I thought it would be but its nicely balanced and very tasty. The alcohol is noticeable but not too bad for a 9% beer. Full bodied.

1194,"2006-03-26",4.1,"bottle - Pours clear and gold with a thin, fading head that leaves a bit of lacing.  The aroma is dominated by piney hops and has a hint of alcohol.  The flavor is of course hoppy, but is also surprisingly well balanced for such intense hop flavors.  The label doesnt lie when it says a ""ridiculous amount"" of barley was used.  It must have taken a lot to balance this hoppy beast so well.  The finish is hoppy as expected, long lasting, and the 9% alcohol is well masked.  This is an excellent brew.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
1194,"2006-03-25",3.7,"The 90 Minute poured out in light copper color and a large slightly off white head.  A bit of the head lasted until the bitter end along with some light lacing.  The aroma was alcohol, citrus and bread.  The alcohol was the strongest aromatic player.  At the first sip the initial sweat caramel flavor gives way to the somewhat harsh bitter bite that lingers until the next sip.  Very nice balance of high gravity sweatness and hoppy goodness.  It feels like a medium body that certianly finishes dry.  A solid imperial IPA.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1194,"2006-03-25",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2006 This was the beer (had my first one a couple months ago) that showed me what a good craft beer could be, since the 6% cap was lifted in NC last October.  This is a beer of well-balanced contrasts - hoppy bitterness balanced by fruity sweetness.  High alcohol content that is so well disguised that you will feel the effect before you taste any alcohol.  Rich mouthfeel yet so drinkable that it seems no sooner do I open one than it is gone, leaving me yearning for another.

1194,"2006-03-24",3.6,"90 Minute IPA poured a crystalline orange tone topped of a fuzzy white head. The aroma initially evokes sweetened grapefruit and orange, a hoppy nose that only subsequently accretes in complexity. Mirabelle, pineapple and vanilla are soon revealed to create a fruity blend that merges with the alcohol tones of an expensive flowery perfume. A grainy wheat smell that reminds of Corn Flakes is further supported by Parmesan cheese and surprises amidst the traditional hops. Meanwhile the looming sweetness of chestnut honey provides a luscious background to the elaborate nose of this beer. As the tip of the tongue collides with the liquid a sweet flavor of orange juice appears but gradually expands to a hoppy burnt toast sensation and ultimately descends to a creamy finish. The strong carbonation and bitterness of the palate renders this beer difficult for me to drink and evaluate but I do appreciate the attempt at a more complex brew in this style.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

The smell:  Like slightly rotten fruit.  The look: Totally filtered darkish amber.  Large head. The taste: The sweetness of hops is brought to the forefront and one feels as if he is on a dessert island with Jimmy Buffet.

This beer is a hop monster wrapped up in malt and some kinda fruity caramel I think, and all this is locked up by the hot hint of alcohol. A distinct taste that my inexperienced palate learned to enjoy half a beer in. I like the bitter finish and will drink another just to see if I can figure that mystery taste out.

1194,"2006-03-13",3.7,"On tap.Pours clear deep amber, forming a dense white head that slowly recedes to a thin layer floating on top and leaves lots of lace on the sides of the glass. Aroma is pretty standard PNW-hop fare -- floral, spicy, lemon/grapefruit, a bit of pine sap, and a rather subdued malt profile. And so it is with the flavor as well, where malt is subordinate to the hops as they variously assert their signature citrus, floral and piney characteristics. Malt sweetness is not entirely absent and brings itself sufficiently to bear to assure some balance. Medium-thick mouthfeel, thick palate with bitter floral aftertaste.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

The flavor is multifaceted with caramel, robust hops, maple syrup, brown sugar, tobacco, and even a slight touch of smoke. The mouth feel is viscous and weighty and it has just a touch of sweetness.

The aroma was, as it is supposed to be, dominated by hops. There was a moderate to heavy presence of grass with notes of grapefruit in the background. In addition, I was just able to detect a hint of saddle leather hiding in the background. The body was medium to full with soft carbonation and a creamy texture. Initially, the flavor was lightly sweet. As it matured into a long finish, it changed to a moderate bitterness with slight astringency and a nice alcohol warmth.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"

Nose is herbaceous, very resiny, with a plenty of fruit and malt in the background.  An onslaught of hops battles it out with the malt sweetness.  The succulent oily hops take over which, while very strong, arent overly bitter.  Alcohol stays hidden very nicely without being nonexistant.  medium bodied with an slick oily texture and a pleasant CO2 tingle.  Long bitter finish with just enough caramel malts to get you through.  Although it definately leans on its hops character its very well behaved.

Re-rate:  I know its only been a month since I rated but Ive compared quite a few brews to the 90 minute and nothing captures the essence of this stuff.  Some bring a well balanced package, and some cram in the hops until oil bleeds from the bottle, but Dogfish walks the line and delivers on some unthought of level.  Four of these are going to be subjected to various degrees of aging and I cant wait to see what happens when the edgy hops are attenuated a bit.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","schoolofspool"

A mostly malty aroma with subdued hop scent. Not neccesarily bad just very unexpected. The hop character comes out more in the flavor but not as big as I like. It is well balanced and deep with the fruity malts but not particularly bright. The alchohol is well hidden and the body is full and creamy which is probably the best attribute of this imperial.

In the mouth it is smooth but not thin, and a sweet maltiness to open is followed by the dominating hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth, for me just a little to aggressively.

Redrink, after further examination, theres a bit more going on in both the aroma and the flavor.  Granted, this is after a couple months of tasting beers/aging.  The light caramel malts are much more obvious in the nose, almost syrupy.  Further, the flavors are much more complex.

Palate entry introduces a strong malt backbone, full body and commanding presence.

1194,"2006-02-09",4.3,"This is not a subtle beer. Definitely not your typical IPA. Thick head, very powerful aroma, pours a medium amber color. Incredibly hop presence with a slight bitterness. Overwhelming taste that comes at you from all directions.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","2beerguys"
1194,"2006-02-06",4.2,"Orange colour bordering on the red hues. Thin white bubbley head. Floral and piney hops fill your nose, some spice is noted as well. Huge thick malty body with loads of hops. Lots of pine flavours with bittering finish. For being such an overly hopped beer, it has so much balance. I was quite surprised at how well done this beer was.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
1194,"2006-02-05",5.0,"Bottle.  Purchased in Fort Myers Florida.  Made sure to look for this one since you cant get it in Minnesota where Im from.  This is a truly special beer.  Everything just works here.  Grapefruit and citrus floral flavor with a nice bite in the finish.  But it is extremely smooth for an IPA and not as harsh as some can be.  This is not a beer or a style that all enjoy, but for me, its heavenly!  Superb!","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
1194,"2006-02-04",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2006 (updated 05/1/2006)  - Got this on a bottle for the 2006 Spring bottling. After having the 120 Minute a few weeks ago, Im workign back down the scale. Almost as sweet as the 120 but without the kick. Plesantly candied and hoppy, just about right, although, Id follow this up with a cold Shelter Pale Ale before downing another 90 Minute. (adjusted rating from 3.3 up to 3.8)

Im not exactly a hophead, but this was a bit more pleasant than some IPAs Ive had. I had this as par tof a sampler at the DFH Gaithersbug Alehouse (2/4/2006). I thought, out of the five (5), this was #4 on my list. It finished a bit more bitter than I would have hoped given all the raves from friends. It did go extremely well with the spicy (and I do mean spicy) Jambalya for the evening.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","webjedi"
1194,"2006-02-04",4.1,"Bottle at Roys Restaurant.  Poured a orangy-gold color with a small off white head.  Aroma was intense with hops and pine.  The flavor was initially malty with a touch of honey sweetness and then the ruby red grapefruit, pine and bitter hops flavor hits you.  I had no clue it was 9.0% ABV, I would have thought it was in the 6.5% range, did a great job of hiding it.  It was very full and even a bit syrupy on the palate.  Really wonderful IIPA, definitely the best Ive had thus far and my favorite Dogfish Head to date.","Oldsmar, Florida, USA","kfarrnd"

1194,"2006-01-29",4.0,"12 oz. bottle. Clear, beautiful amber color. Strong hop aroma, and the taste is as expected very hoppy.

1194,"2006-01-27",4.7,"Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA pours to a beautiful, bright, deep orange color with a thick and creamy off white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose of this beer is stunning. Huge waves of piney/citric/spicy/resiny hop aromas flood the nose. I shouldnt say aromas, it is more like intense hop vapors. The palate is firm, you can tell they did indeed use a ""ridiculous"" amount of malt in this beer, to stand up to the hop character. But this beer is all about hops, and they are in this beer big time. Slight flavors of pale malts pair with intense fruity/citric juicy hop flavors on the palate. 90 Mintue IPA finishes with more hop flavors up front, then ends with a long, dry, very zesty/piney/resiny hop bitterness coupled with a high octane burn that lingers for quite some time. 

This beer is amazing. It is a very drinkable beer at 9% abv, so be careful with this one. I would suggest the 60 Minute IPA if you wanted more than a few, the 90 Minute is one you will want to drink sparingly. I can not put into words the depth of hop character in this beer, in flavor and aroma. It dominates this beer, but it isnt a throat peeling, all out acid wash of hop bitterness. There is some real hop synergy and hop magic going on here, putting the hop character of this beer is a class by itself. Every bit of hop flavor, aroma, and character you could get out of the hop varieties used, are squeezed into this beer. You would have to taste this beer to understand what I mean. This beer could stand hop for hop with the best of the best from the PNW, and truly is one of the most exceptional ""Imperial"" IPAs on the market. 90 Mintue IPA is a hop heads dream come true. If you love hoppy beers, then this beer is a must try, and a holy grail of a beer. It is a bit pricey at $8 a 750ml bottle, or $12 a 4 pack of 12oz bottles, but worth every penny, and then some. A perfect aperitif beer, or a beer to enjoy and relax with after a brutal day at work.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

The aroma only hints at how good this beer tastes.  The flavor is one of a kind.  Very smooth, with a unique, almost velvety mouth texture.  Hints of grapefruit and bittersweet chocolate, with a good balance between malt and hops.  ABV is 9%, but you cant tell at all.  Let this sit in your mouth for a few seconds at just-below-ice-cold and the torrent of flavor becomes a real joy.  Im very impressed.  Extra helpings of love went into this one.","Gainesville, Florida, USA","pjyielder"
1194,"2006-01-23",4.4,"This IPA pours a beautiful golden color, it leaves a nice sticky white lace that sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is of hops, lemon, sweet fruit. I let this beer sit for a minute to bring out more flavor and aroma, and as I put it back to my nose more floural and spicey aromas became present. As I tasted this beer I let the beer sit on my palate and so many delicious flavors came to mind, a smoothe, malty, hoppy finish. The taste is carmalized fruits, grape, peaches, caramel, and kick of hops. You cant even taste the 9% abv. This is the best IPA, actually one of the best beers Ive had the priviledge of tasting.","Portland, Oregon, USA","fbennett"

Mouthfeel slightly syrupy, sticky (is this a DFH trademark?). The flavor is sweet then bitter. Aftertaste of hops. Easier to handle than the 120 Minute which will kick you in the ass quickly. This also seems less carbonated. Very much the same beer to me, just less extreme. Would be easier to go back to.  Updated 7/12/08: Well I had this again at a DFH beer tasting and finally realized just how good a big IPA it is. Really not overly sweet as I may have felt before. The wondrous hop bouquet is as fresh as any I’ve tasted in a beer. Just so fresh and alive tasting, even from a bottle. Lovely caramel and vanilla malt base. I’ve had more perspective on this style since my first rating and now put it up there with the best.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"

1194,"2006-01-15",4.1,"Had this on-tap in a pint at BJs Boulder. Beer pours a hazy dark orange color with a small, creamy, off-white, mostly diminishing head. The aroma is thick with wonderful things: light malty notes of roasted grain, cookie and caramel; heavily hoppy with notes of flowers, herbs, sweet, fresh apricot and resin/pine; lightly yeasty with notes of sunny barnyard; and miscellaneous notes of honey, peaches and vanilla. The flavor was moderately sweet, heavily bitter and ended with an average-length, lightly sweet, moderately bitter finish. The body was medium-to-full, the texture was watery, the carbonation was lively and there was a light alcoholic feel. This was definitely my favorite IPA of any type that Ive tasted so farit was juicy, complex and multi-dimensional.

Medium-to-full bodied IPA that starts with light malt sweetness and intense hoppy flavors. Finishes dry with lingering bitterness.

1194,"2005-12-01",4.3,"Ive been trying to get this beer for a few weeks and was then waiting for a good occasion to try it.  Last day of classes seemed appropriate.  Great hops and other notes in the aroma.  Thin white head on a perfect tawny body.  Little bubbles rising like a champagne.  Smooth taste for the 9% ABV.  Crisp and smooth hops in the taste.

1194,"2005-11-27",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2008 bottle. Pours a very rich dark gold with an appealing white head. The aroma is very robust with giant barley and nice spicy hops. The hops are ridiculous in the flavor, but countered so well with outrageous barley. Between these two warring aspects a little sweeter caramel and softer leafy notes make themselves known. As the beer warms, the bitterness becomes a little more evident, but is still evenly balanced by the bready barley. The 9% is completely hidden. This beer is just plain absurd and over the top. I like it.

On tap at Bier Garden: I really wanted to revisit this one because the last time I sampled it was next to Dreadnaught. hah. This didnt hold a candle to that one, but thats more of a testament to the power of Dreadnaught and not the weakness of 90 minute. The pour was very nice on this with a clear dark golden body and a tall, dense white head. The aroma proved  ballsy this time with loads of cutting grapefruit and pine. Mouthfeel is nice on this, just dense enough to carry the sweet, clean caramel flavor and the stinging hop blast.  Really this is a solid, highly recommendable IIPA.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1194,"2005-11-27",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2015 First rating (2005): Creamy, offwhite medium head, clear orange body. Light aroma of citrusy hops with hints of pine needles. Deep firm taste of hops (citrusy, pine-like, some resin) and sweet caramel malts. Long, lingering aftertaste of hops. Broad, firm body, oily mouthfeel. Hard to separate out all the tastes here.

1194,"2005-11-23",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2008 Rerate.  Holy crap, I should say this needs rerated.  12oz bottle on 12/28/07.  Clear orange amber with a small light beige head, fair retention.  Hops in the aroma consist of spicy pine, floral, and a little bit of grapefruit rinds.  It kinda has the same nose as a NG Hop Hearty in that the hops seem like their slightly stale, though freshness isnt the issue since its less than two months old.    Caramel malts back it all up with some spicy alcohol.  Flavor improves a bit with a little more grapefruit rind notes and an overall fresher taste.  The malts do add a bit of a concentrated fruit sugar (raisin) that helps with the caramel to bring it into somewhat of a balance from the hops.  Dry finish with the alcohol covered better than I had expected.  Bitterness peaks around a 4-5.  Full body with low to moderate carbonation.  This is probably one of the easier drinking DIPAs as far as balance is concerned.  Old ratingbottle.  pours a nice copper colo with average-sized off-white diminishing head, smells of floral and citrus hops with a little caramel.  Well carbonated, nice and bitter.

1194,"2005-11-20",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 Long ago, before all that historic riff-raff of kings and ninjas, mankind laid down its first challenge.  In its primitive wisdom it chose as its opponent the new and verdant heavy weight champion: nature.  And since that obscure era of antiquity we have come to blows with this ethereal titan more times than we can count.  This might explain the cultural fascination with the hardy farmer.  Though a poor man, the tiller of soil goes on from day to day, raising grain from the ground, striking it down again and consuming it.  Its feral, in a way, but completely instinctual.  See him, arms flanking a compassionate breast, wrenching nature by the root to feed his family.  Watch him toil under grim conditions to fetch a days meal.  
It is not shocking then, that even today we admire this so-called vanguard of humanity.  The land tillers and cultivators live on the forefront of this battle and reside on the skirts of society.  Weve done much to acknowledge the pastoral warrior; propaganda posters, trade laws and gushing movies.  But by God its about time we had a beer for it too.  A exhaustively written story of mans struggle with nature would be both trite and exhaustingly long, so instead I urge you to pick up a bottle of Dogfish Heads Imperial IPA.  Everything about this beer symbolizes that calm skirmish that doggedly continues in the field.  The color is a jaw-dropping gold, like lambent cluster of candles in a monastery, clear enough to see the world (now your world) through a most distinguished lens.  You have a view into the palace of Midas, everything from the sofa  to the refrigerator is an intense gold.  Move closer, and youll begin to inhale a cavalcade of grains and hops; an intense burst of the IPA signature hopsiness that mellows into a colorful flowery fragrance, and finally whispers away with the slightest tease of pumpkin.  Closer still and youll take the stuff to your lips.  The inexperienced palate will reel for a moment due in part to strong carbonation and a fist full of hops.  The hops then lunges for the back of the mouth while a dry, biscuity flavor loiters on the front of the tongue.  Then comes the prolonged aftertaste, a toasty coating around the mouth and down the throat.  Admittedly its a harsh beer.  Im almost inclined to liken it to being lashed on the tongue with a bundle of grains.  The 90 Minute Imperial IPA is a beer that represents that age old deadlock, that symbolizes mans foolhardy attempt to subdue nature, and that simulates the plight of that humbly glorious man of the field.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1194,"2005-11-19",3.6,"Deep copper color, diminishing head. Extremely bright.  Aroma is strongly perfumey and flowery - with sweeter smelling flowers as well as some oddball marigolds. Fairly resinous as well, presumably the simcoe, with mild citrus (orange). Also, an aroma that I can only describe as urine, which unfortunately I find consistently aligned with Amarillo hops. Has an explosive amount of hops flavor, lifted out of your nostrils by the ethanol, which is not very apparent. Apparent bitterness is actually quite low, nestled in heaps of barley sugar. Warming, slightly chewy finish. This is very drinkable for such a big beer. Nicely done, overall.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

Well balanced, maybe too much so.  Hard to tell this baby is clocking in at 9% abv.

Copper amber colored, showing chill haze, with a medium white head that slowly recedes to a ring around the glass.  In more recent years this ring seems to dies rather than stick to the glass.  Im not quite sure why.  The taste is hops and plenty of em right from the get go.  Theres citrus, grapefruit, pine and if fresh - grass/plant coming from the dry hopping.  Multi-dimensional, this beer adds biscuit, grains, a hint of alcohol, and a slight sweet malt to the mix.  Medium bodied, medium carbonation, crisp and bitter mouthfeel that cleanes that palate after every sip.  Adding to the rating 10/11/05: On draught this is a different animal.  Yeah randall is fun, but it takes away from the body and only adds a little to the aroma and flavor.  Nope, this is best on draught, no randall.  You really cant ask for a better appearance, beautifully retained & thick head.  Fresh on tap, the aroma is so fresh, crisp, and assertive with body and taste to match.

1194,"2005-09-13",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2007 Got this bottle while visiting relatives in Michigan, and have been looking forward to trying it finally.

Pours a golden color with a decent head that slowly fades away to a small cap with some pretty decent lacing.

Smells is citrus, pine, hops and malt. Not as overwhelming as I expected. This is my first double IPA, and I was expecting a stronger assault on the nose.

Taste is initially citrus and hops, but finishes with a nice malt sweetness to it. Its smoother and has a lot more balance than I was expecting. I find that I have to force myself to not drink this to quickly.

As for the flavor, let me start by saying that Im not a big fan of bitter, so I was prepared to be disappointed by something that Sir Hops Alot had been attacking for 90 minutes.  I was very plesantly surprised.  While you can definitely tell that it has a lot of hops, its very balanced by the malt and the dry hopping at the end.

Its decidedly apricot and honey on the nose with some sweetness and nuttiness in the palate. The citrus kicks in and makes for a complex flavor profile for an IPA.

Medium-strong standard hops aroma, acerbic and cloying. Impressive! Flavor is so smooth and silky, with fantastic symmetry in the flavor profile and a complex blossom of hop and malt notes. Absolutely delicious, I wish I could drink this for days on end. Complex blend of cream, wheat, malt, brown sugar, grapefruit, floral, and light almonds. Palate is very sweet and sticky, making you want for more. Chewy, with a very strong texture. Fantastic. More drinkable than most IIPAs Ive had.
Rerate - 12 Oz Bottle - 6/3/6/2/13=3.0 What the hell was I thinking? This is terrible. Aroma is a stagnant cesspool of catty hop flesh and decaying ferns. There are some bright spots with a little candied resin. Pour is acceptable with a burnished gold afroth with white. Flavor is immediately sapifying. Theres too much sugar from the get go. Cats climb into bed with caramelized raisins. Lots of stinky residuals, greased with high gravity yeast by-products. Filtering removes probably any intrigue. Theres a creamy softness, likely derived only from excessive malt content. It doesnt approach the warm breadiness from hop construction in good examples. Palate is downright sticky. Theres a creeping ugly plant bitterness in the backend. Combine that quality with excess sugars and I left a third of a glass at the bar. Im glad to see my tastes have improved. New score is composite.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Taste is variations on the first sip. Goes something like this: hoppy burn, alcohol burn, sticky rich malt. Rinse. Repeat. OK the alcohol burn is understated and slow to build which actually make it quite warming in the gullet. The hops are an explosion and actually burn the tongue a bit like a good habenero sauce would. There is some citrus in there but mostly bitingly bitter herbal hop flavors. The malt is rich and sweet, molasses, burnt caramel and such. Mouth is sticky, the hops for all their glory do tend to get washed on the tongue by the considerable malt but do linger on the roof of the mouth forever. And your teeth.

Pours copper-orange and clear with a full and long-lived head for the style. The aroma is, unsurprisingly, a hoppy grapefruit and juniper. This one is rich on the palate, oily with a drawn out and complex rush of flavor. 

The flavor was sweeter and maltier than I expected upon my first sample (I was better prepared upon later encounters.) This is not a bitter IIPA (the glass of Rogue IIPA that I was drinking at the same time was far more intense and far more bitter). Instead, one gets a suite of sweet alchol/fermentation flavors, banana esters, and lots of syrupy sweetness.

I was amazed to discover that this beer is as good as the best IPAS you will find on tap.  In many bottled IPAS the beer is much different than on tap.  There tends to be an excess of bitterness and lack of malt balance.  However, the 90 minute is very well balanced with the hops not overtaking the malt.  Also, there was no diacetyl or oxidation in any of the bomber bottles I have tasted.

There is somewhat of a minute hidden roasted coffee scent.  Very rich hop flavor that is not too overpowering and a nice malt balance.  It has a sweet citrus taste.

First taste gives you instant gratification with a smooth yet powerful wave of flavors. Hops hit ya then the malt smoothes it out. Great, great finish, not overly hoppy like some IPAs. Sticky to the tongue but does not linger toooo long. Nice coating of flavor all around.

The flavor can best be described as smooth.. Amazingly smooth for an IPA.  The malt so well balances the hops in this one.  Very well balanced..  Some citrus flavor but mostly sweetness (caramel) can be tasted in this and a touch of grapefruit on the back but not that usual bitter smack Ive come to expect from IPAs..

Floral nose very quickly becomes malt dominated.  Sweet maltiness balanced by noticable alcohol heat and bite.  In the finish, the hops return again with a slight bitterness and a pleasant citrusy mouthcoat.  This citrus helps dampen the lingering alcohol character.

1194,"2005-04-15",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2006 Bottle.  Bank error in my favor!  I bought a single, and when I brought it to the checkout, they rang it up as a 60 Minute IPA.  I got 30 minutes for free!
Poured clear amber with a good head that left a good lace.  Initial aroma warned of over the top hops.  At that moment, I was convinced that death was imminent.  I let it sit for a few moments, partly to let it settle, partly out of fear.  Aroma became a bit woody, and caramelly as the hops retreated a bit.  OK, first sip *cringing*  Hmmm, its pretty smooth.  I mean, theres a hop sting, but its not overdone.  Theres also caramel and sweet malts, woodiness and some astringency.  Theres not a lot going on (as far as breadth goes), but what it lacks in breadth, it more than makes up for in depth.  All present aspects are heavy.  Lots of hops, but its balanced by lots of malt, and thats balanced by the combination of brandy and woodiness.  It finishes dry and bitter, but not too much to make you cringe.  This is much better than I was expecting
Rerate.  I had to bump this up a notch.  After repeated samples, this is by far one of my favorites.  It sits somewhere between IPA and barleywine.","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

This beer is murrr-ky.  Very cloudy, nice burnt orange color, with a head full of crowded tiny bubbles that last all the way down.  
Aroma is surprisingly malty for a beer that bills itself as a hop monster.  It IS hoppy - but also maltier than Id have suspected.  Id say its a little less sweet than some of the other DIPAs Ive had (think Stoudts), but it strikes me as a little on the astringent and harsh side.  
The alcohol is well hidden in this; probably wouldnt guess it was 9%.  
This is good - very good - but I think the 60 Minute is even better, especially on cask.  In fact, it really makes me want to try the 90 on tap/cask, and see if its a little more balanced.  I should say that this bottle, which was aged somewhat, was, in fact, more balanced and subtler than the fresh stuff I had last July.","Dallas, Texas, USA","monty"

Citrusy and hoppy aroma that also hints at a strong malt backing. Amazing rich flavor. I think grapefruit immediately and maybe melon at the as well? Incredibly complex with the huge amount of hops with enough malt to keep this beer from being overly bitter or one dimensional. Challenging to the palate while still being extremely drinkable.

Straight fom the cellar @ 51.3° and served in my NB worthy glass. It poured light orange with a smallish off white head. When swirled, the beer coats the glass. Aroma is hops, nice and spicy and beautiful. There is also a honeyish background. The taste is hop flavored with all kinds of crazy flavors, the first the comes to mind is a honeydew melon (thats a first in a beer for me!). The hops are also spicy and piney, but that melon flavor really steals the show.  Pretty tasty. The bitterness not overwelhming, but it can be felt.  Despite its huge hop aroma, this is a somewhat balanced beer. The finish is piney and melon flavored, with a bit of tongue tingle from the underlying bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and full.

Its aroma is some spicy floral piney hops at first.  It kind of devolves into a peppery leather smell though that isnt very appealing.

The flavor is sweet melon and some pepper up front.  I dont get much hop flavor, but it does have a good lingering bitter aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but very smooth.

If youre looking for an American hop bomb, this is the furthest thing from it. Clear amber color, moderate head, good lace/retention.  Its malt forward with toffee and wood, some caramel.

2/6/05:   golden amber color, fluffy and rocky white head.  nose is strong hops, pine, resin.  powerful hop bitternes, resiny  flavor too.  not cloying like the 120min.  dry citrus for measure but not too much.  not sticky sweet like a lot of other IIPAs.  an imperial IPA on the brink but keeps it together.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","MullMan"

Delicious after taste made me want to take my time drinking it.  Slight warming sensation in the belly.  Taste very even for an IIPA, I like this beer a lot, Im glad Ive got another one stored away.

1194,"2005-02-01",3.6,"Had to see what the big deal on this stuff was, so I picked up a 4 pack.  Coppery color with a tan coating for the head, ends up ringing down the side of the glass.  Aroma is pungent hops, with hints of the malt.  The taste has a great balance, but not until the 2nd or 3rd sip. After you get past the original bitterness, you realize the complexity and evenness of the flavor.  Aftertaste is very palatable, not too bitter, but holds the taste from the mouthfull.  Feels a little bit fizzy in your mouth, maybe a newer bottle, I think I will have to cellar some of this and see how it is in about a year.

Maybe it happened to do with it being taken directly from the cool, cool basement rather than fridged first.  Still highly sweet and syrupy and sticky, and pretty alcoholic in the flavor/palate.  And Im still too afraid to take another shot at the 120-minute monstrosity concocted by this brewery.  Only so much A-oiliness I can take.

This needs more balance.  It isnt too highly hopped; its too highly alcoholic in the flavor and palate!  Oily character comes through too much.  Stones Ruination IPA managed to do this style to perfection; this has too much A.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

1194,"2005-01-03",4.1,"Awesome beer that started off my eve before New Years Eve.  Moderate head, about 1/3"".  Smells sweet, smooth and crisp.  Color is calming; an easy amber brown.  ""Holy crap"" was what went through my mind as I took the first sip.  Tastes of honey, alcohol and lemons.  Mouth watering and semi-citrusy; very sharp.  Grassy and bitter afterbite, making me pucker up.  You could feel the alcohol resonate with the finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1194,"2005-01-02",3.6,"Nice hoppy aroma, but could use a little more dry hopping.  Golden to Amber and slightly hazy in appearance.  Very heavy malty flavor.  Balances more toward the malt than the hops.  I get a slightly strange aftertaste.  Another rating said metallic, and that is what it feels like.  Warmth from the alcohol content.  Overall, not bad but I would rather go with a hoppier regular IPA or an Imperial IPA.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","RateandPillage"

This beer starts with a sweet chocolate/candy base.  Then the hops literally jump off the tongue and tingle the roof of my mouth.  Is this an IIPA or a stout?

So sweet in fact that you could not tell that there was any alcohol at all. Hops were a disappointment as I had expected some ultra-super-dooper-high hop bitterness. This was very underhopped in my opinion for a top-notch IPA. Could it be that Dogfish head gets my newest ""Overrated"" vote?","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"

Sweet maltiness, with a touch of brown sugar and toffee.  More sweet apricot/papaya fruitiness as well.  Flavour is also very hoppy tasting.  Sweet caramel balancing the sweet fruity hops.  Light resin and a beautiful citrus flavour.  Some hints of alcohol toward the back that help thin the body a bit.  Great beer.  I underestimated it the first time around.

Deep amber-orange colour with a very thin white lacing. Slightly cloudy.   Rich caramel toffee malts balance off a huge load of pine, spice, and grapefruity hops.  There is also a bright citrus hop aroma and some cookie dough in the malt profile.  Flavour is quite well-balanced with just enough malty sweetness to balance the prominent hopping.  Resiny and citrusy hop flavour with a nicely bitter finish.  A good beer, but I think its highly over-rated.

1194,"2004-11-30",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2005 Draught.  Flying Saucer in Fort Worth, Texas while attending the Breeders Cup, October 30, 2004.  Great look of dark orange and amber and nose is strong malt and hops.  Huge thick and chewy head that stays for the entire pint.  I have been told about this one for a while, but I believe it has a bit too much sweetness.  I did drink this one outside on a sunny day (not the perfect environment for a heavily malted IPA) but I still found it a bit too malty and barleywine-ish.  Not that that is terrible by any means, it just masked these great and uncommon hops, and I wanted to taste some more of those.  I cant wait to try the 60 minute....
I sampled this one again on 1-29-2005 with homebrewerguy from the bottle.  Not nearly as sweet as the draught and also a bit more smoky.  Actually a little more interesting if sampled from the bottle.  Good stuff","Sligo","pjk33"

The only imperial IPA Ive had before is Victory Hop Devil, and honestly, I was a bit drunk at the time so I never rated it (Mondiale de la biere 2004).  That being said, I dont remember that one being as malty or complex as this.  This tastes much like some of the better barley wines Ive had.  Huge nose of malt and hops, sweet and chewy mouthfeel, with a LONG finish of 3 hops Ive never knowingly had before.  Incredible beer.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"

I poured it into a narrow pilsener glass for some odd reason, but that let me see its copper body with golden highlights, under a bubbly head. The taste is sticky; any sweeter and itd be beer candy. Then I noticed the nice American IPA hop bill sliding in nice and gently, until it demonstrates its every bit the match of the oversized malt profile. Total impression is of a hoppy young barley wine. I hadnt realized this was an Imperial IPA. Ill have to see if I can cellar my remaining bottles.

1194,"2004-11-18",4.0,"Relatively clear amber body with vibrant oranges and syrupy brown and honey colors. Head is loose, white and does not last long at all. Smell is hoppy with pine fragrances, as well as fruity melons and bananas.  Mouth feel is cool and syrupy. Flavor comes with a wallop of dry vegetable/pine cone hops then gets sweeter with fruity papaya, pineapple and sweet melon. Aftertaste is that excellent, dry, biting hop flavor that you want from a good IPA coupled with some nice roasty nut flavors. Alcohol is definitely there too and is brutish for the otherwise refined high alcohol beverages by DFH. But still, its completely normal for a big IPA. You know, if I had been blindfolded in a room of 100 IPAs (heaven for most of you), I guarantee I could have found this beer and classified it as DFH, it just has that distinctiveness.

1194,"2004-10-23",4.1,"This is a very interesting IPA.  The smell reminds me of an oak cask with hints of charcoal.  Pours nice.  The flavor for an IPA is simply unique.  First off, theres no overwhelming hop aftertaste, instead its more a continuation of flavors throughout.  The initial taste is hoppy citrus with a preeminent alcohol flavoring (usually the inability to mask alcohol is bad, but in this case it is welcome).  The flavoring of the hops is very unique.  The complexity is superb, with no individual dominance, but instead a pleasing harmony of flavors throughout.  A little dark and dreary for an IPA, needs more life, but still extremely deep and satisfying.  If there was a uniqueness rating ... it would receive a 10.  Excellent overall, refinements would make this an unbelievable offering.","USA","Loddeer"

Clear copper coloured body with white head that recedes to thin cover with some patchy lacing. Pine, orange, woody notes to the aggressive hop flavour that is cut by a sugary sweetness with finishing bitterness that seems comparatively light. Medium-full body and tingling mouthfeel.

Seems really smooth to me, for a beer with such a hop presence, and, for the record, I generally think of myself as a hophead. Im glad to have some on hand, whenever possible, and its certainly a tasty beer--theres enough malt to keep it drinkable, and the ensuing 9%ABV beer buzz from my 12 oz bottle was pleasant.

Aroma: BAM! Whoppity-snappityBAM!BOOM!BAM!, thats the full force of the pine up in there, the intense grapefruit, all the citric flavor that embarks on the senses and nevers flags for a second, grassy, herbal, potent, totally hoppy, sprucey, piney, pineappley, so much going on in this nose!
But, to taste...Ah! A wonderful mess here, a big, mix of hops and citric fruity flavor, the punchy pine on the palate, yum, yum, yum. If youre not sufficiently infatuated with humulous lupus, sit this one out, by all means. A big, sticky, fruity, citric mouthfeel, and, yeah, theres grapefruit, but so much more.

Many juicy hop tones. The malt is very subdued, providing some body and a backbone but not much flavor. The hops bring tons of grapefruit accompanied by orange and lemon.

Floral, apricot, leather, pine and lots of other things going on I cant quite put a name to. Taste is huge and mouth-filling, but still a well-balanced play between malt and hops. Though as the glass progresses, the hops win out. The 9% ABV hides pretty well, but provides a nice warming sensation.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

Gorgeous orange color with obvious strength by how the light is refracted by the thick syrupy body and the numerous bubbles move slowly to the dense perfect white head.

As SilkTork says, Randall wasnt working when we were there, although they did manage to get it set up the following day.

Looks like a picture.  Rich aroma of grapefruit, orange, a bit of pine, and some sweet candy and brown sugar.  Taste is orange, grapefruit, pine... somewhat bitter but hugely supported by sweet malt.  Creamy body thats full but feels perhaps a bit undercarbonated.

A very nice beer.","Georgia, USA","kosh"
1194,"2004-08-12",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2004 Bottle pours a deep hazy golden with a very nice just off-white head that is reluctant to leave just yet.  There is enough effervessing to maintain it and to support rich sticky lacing.  Aroma is quite hopy (of course) but also somewhat fruity citrusy and floral. Like pumpkin bread or shortbread cookies.  Tastes of strong hops but ballances well with the other, yeast, grain, butter and strangely... carbboard.
Mouthfeel, this I think is its strong point.  It feels full,, heavy, substantial and smooth.  Before you swallow, as you draw it in you can tell that it is going to feel good going down.  And it does.
The bitter hops stays with you and is the calling card it leaves on your palate.

This year the intention was  to have this 90 Minute served through Randell and then it would be called 91 Minute - but the guys were unable to assemble Randell correctly, so we just had it served straight from the cask. Huge hop bitterness, like chewing hop pellets. Though more fragrance than pellets. And backed with malt sweetness. A hop monster for sure. Surprising soft aroma considering the big flavour. I thought this was good.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
1194,"2004-08-09",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2008 What an interesting beer.... First, it poured a radioactive orange color that seemed to glow. Beautifully colored pale orange/yellow head. My first whiff caught me totally off guard. This thing smelled more of chocolate than any beer Ive ever smelled, including the Youngs. Also backed up with some nice aromatic hops.  The taste was equally interesting. First, I tasted a huge amount of malt, then the hops shined through. It struck me as similar to the 120 in that it was very oily and sweet, though not as sweet. THere was a definite hop presence, though. Not until it warmed did the hop juice I expected show through.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Aromas are a surprisingly solid mix of malt and hop.  Flavors are not even close to blaanced.  This beer is an assault of hops.  The difference between this and many hop overboard beers is that this one presents a substantial, sweet, chewy malt backbone on which to stand its hop component.  Its good beer.  No, its great.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1194,"2004-07-14",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2008 Bottle into tulip glass.  If there were a Platonic form of IPA floating in the supersensible ether, DFH 90 min. is the reflection of it in the mortal, human world.  Drinking this is tantamount to fighting off the shadowy, unreal imitations of beer shackling us in our cave of ignorace to emerge (as if from the womb) to see the sunlight for the first time.  The perfection of this beer actually scares me; Im tempted to look into the sun, to try and actually see that glowing orb, but I know I will be blinded by its brilliance.  

Now, to practical matters.  The smell: smoky hops and alcohol.  The vision: orange amber, clear, with a peachish white head, creamy and average sized, mostly lasting, small-bubble lacing.  The taste: cream and fruit at first and some unexpected maltiness; hops bitter comes on slow like a train from far away, and intensifies; basil dryness and a bit of black pepper accent the hops; all flavors last through the long finish.  The touch, the feel: medium to full bodied; creamy; soft carbonation.  Overall: DOPE.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Lots of sweet crystal malts balance out the orange-grapefruit hop flavor and snappy bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with a long bitter-sweet finish.

Bottle.  Fantastic orange colour, small head that dissipates quickly.  Lots of citrus hops right off the bat in the aroma.  First taste is surprising  there is a lot more body to this than I was expecting.  But I found it very syrupy  it certainly balanced off the hops, which I really enjoyed in the taste  yes, they were aggressive, especially in the finish, but I thought they totally made the beer.  What I didnt like was the overpowering alcohollike syrupy taste I got.  So overall, certainly a good beer, one of the best Ive tasted for taming a tremendous amount of hops, but the balance isnt quite there.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

A beautiful frothy head that had a very pleasing hoppy aroma.  Extreme cloves comes to mind.  The initial flavor was a bit overwheling for me (too hoppy) but doesnt linger for too long.  The finish is soft and sweet.  You certainly can feel the 9% ABV half way through.  The strong hops flavor reminds me of the same hoppy flavor s at American micro breweries.

I enjoyed the dominant floral charicteristics of this brew, as opposed to the huge citrus/ grapefruit found in most big IPAs.  Long semi sweet finish.

The hops do not overpower the malty goodness. Very juicy citric hop bitterness (grapefruit and orange rinds). The yeast acts as a softening influence to round out the taste. The 9 percent alcohol so well hidden, this would be a dangerous brew for me if it was available locally.

1194,"2004-03-15",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2006 This has to be the most extreme IPA I have ever tasted, which was to be expected. But my overall expectations were way off. There was very little head, and what did exsist lasted only a few seconds then ran for the sides of my glass and hide there the rest of the session. A deep, hazy amber. The nose was strong of hops and hops alone. The taste is brutally hopped, but right when you are about to curse the heavy hand of the hop tosser... the malts come around and save the day.  You are still left with the pine-citrus linger, which is plesent, but not extra-ordinary. I suspect much time went into balancing such a big beer. I like IPAs this one was just a little over the top for me.

There is hoppy presance and you can tell that there is strength there but everything is strangly muted. Then the color is orange/red but clear with a beautiful head. But really clear, not what I was expecting to see of a so-called bottle conditioned beer. The flavor on the other hand is explosive with powerful malty body that beats up your mout and then come the hops like a pack of wolves hitting every hidden spot with their beautiful bitterness.

I thought the aroma was overly fruity with citrus and bubblegum dominating. The flavor was to the sweet side and the palate was light, dry and softly carbonated.

Pours a clear, dark golden color with fantastic, dense creamy off-white head and viscous, thick appearance.  Just amazing head on this beast, lasts all night long.  Aroma is divine-- bubblegum hops, nice sweetness and floral quality with just enough bite.  Flavor is a bit of a letdown, much milder than I'd expected; piney hops and subtle sweetness return, but it doesn't do a whole lot.  Pretty nice, but not mind-blowing like I'd hoped.  Body is just exquisite, a full, creamy mouthfeel with a nice, smooth finish.  A very drinkable, elegant double IPA.  Just delectable.

Mellow, sweet bubblegum hops, very strong in flavor concentration but mellow, if that makes sense.  Perfectly clean taste of hop and pale malt.  Very fresh and clean taste and feel.  Very nice, cooling mouthfeel and wonderfully smooth finish.  Not too bitter, but very long and elegant finish.  Finish is extremely balanced, as is the beer in general.

1194,"2004-01-02",2.5,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2006 This courtesy of hopsrus (thanks!) poured a clear orange body covered by an initially large off-white head that diminishes quickly in a fin du monde glass. Nevertheless, an honest film for a beer of this caliber maintains the position. The smell is floral hops up front with definite orange character. Innocent malt is not absent from that sniff in the form of baked cookies. As it enters the mouth, its rather ""coating"", thick and velvety as seems usual with dogfish head. First sip is excellent with a sausage+sauerkraut dinner, great combination. I appreciate the difference from all-cascade IPA, but still, the last sips seemed far more boring, one-dimensional, rather tart in mouth and all about agressive (unbalanced) bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is top notch clean though and 9% is nowhere to be found.  On recent samples, either I got over sensible to sweetness or this one got sweeter, because this is agressively sweet for an IPA though not so much as the 120, but still not very pleasant to me, syrupy and very hard to drink.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Large rocky head which fades into almost nothing. Body is a very nice medium amber color. Hops of course are present in the aroma... very heavy with some herb and grapefruit. Texture is creamy, but a little too carbonated on the tongue. Not too thick. Bitter grapefruit like hops all around in the flavor, which I absolutely love. Hops are balanced by the barley, which sweetens it just right.

Old 750ml Bottle - 5/21/04
Nice creamy white head, dark amber body that gets cloudy towards the end of the bottle. Full aroma that isn't your normal IIPA... brown sugar, butterscotch/toffee, cherry, strawberry, cookie. Flavor: Cinnamon applesauce, brown sugar, butterscotch, corriander. I think its like stale hops to, but that could just be in my head. Really complex in both aroma and taste. Very enjoyable.

Smells florally malty with some strong hops in there.

Tastes a bit citrusy. Well balanced between the hops and malt. I was expecting more, to be honest. I mean, it's good, but just not *that* good. The high alcohol content is barely perceivable, but it's there.

Mouthfeel is good and full; anything *but* watery. Nice crisp finish.

9/18 - Has the fresh, clean aroma of a brewery.  The hop flavor is hearty and delicious.  I could actually feel the hop flavor dancing on my tongue well after swallowing - kinda like Indian food.

Im sure I have, but I guess I just never entered it. Anyway, the beer has a lovely amber hue and a frothy, lasting head. It just sparkles in the light. What a great-looking beer. Malts are thick with flavor: toast, some roast and some baked. Cakey and good. Hops really spice up the nose, providing a sense of ""warmth."" Alcohol is wholesome and friendly, like a stone fireplace in a snow-covered cabin. Wonderfully flavored, rich and balanced. One of my favs. Rerate, year-old-plus bottle: Vibrant nose. Rather vinous. Seems thicker and creamier, texture-wise. Much more complex malts, with notes of toffee, dates and caramel. Still a big bitterness, but wafty pine notes have faded.

Start is hoppy like like an IPA should be with a smoky flavor.  This really smooths out and leaves a mild hoppy after taste.  Palate is appropriate and the 9% is spledidly hidden.

1194,"2003-08-23",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2013 This is the beer that led me to this site.  I found the bottle with the guy nailing himself, it looked interesting, I took it home and drank it.  I was impressed, so I went to the website, found a link to here, all downhill ever since.  This is a rating of the 12 oz. bottle.  Nice aroma, hoppy, faintly of violets.  Appropriate deep gold color, nice head, good lacing, clear.  Taste is hoppy, with just enough malt to balance it out.  The alcohol is totally masked, well done.  A highly commendable beer.  RERATE  Almost 10 years later, actually hard to believe it has been that long.  Draft at Aw Shucks, kicked the keg when they filled my growler.  A touch more toward orange than gold in my opinion now.  Aroma tends towards earthy and pine hops.  Flavor matches.  Good toasty, slight caramel malt backbone.  The malt backbone probably impresses me more these days than the hops, which now strike me as a touch on the rough side.  Probably old school high co-humulone hops as opposed to the smoother varieties you get these days.  Alcohol is just a touch apparent now.

Sampled July 2004
A nice strong citrus & pine aroma wafts to my nose as I pour this beer.  It pours a deep copper color and is quite clear.  The head is quite large and it a tan color.  As I take a couple of sniffs I get a strong note of candied orange peel, lychee, grapefruit, apricot, and some pine needles.  The taste tells me that thankfully this is a fresh bottle.  The taste is sweet up front, and is pretty much all hops.  The beer is much less hoppy than your typical west coast hop monster.  Never-the-less this is quite hoppy, with a candied fruitiness in the mouth.  The finish has a hint of harshness from the mixture of alcohol and hops, a sort of raw hop type astringency that clings to my mouth in the finish.  I really like the front half of this beer, it is like sucking on a candied hop lollipop.  This is quite tasty, yet is still missing that certain something to really make this great.

Sampled August 2003
Pours brilliantly clear.  This beer is an amber color with a pale tan head.  The aroma is of American hops; floral and grapefruity.  It smells a bit sweet as well.  It tastes citrusy with a  sweet maltiness to it.  Finished by a solid bitterness.  This beer tastes strong with a bit of alcohol in the finish. There seems to be something missing to make this a great beer, nothing wrong with it, just seems to be missing something that could push it over the edge.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The aroma is citric and sweet, but the flavor is mysteriously smoky, malty, and spicy with a dry bitter finish. This is an excellent beer by anyones standards, but it was not as interesting an experience as I had anticipated it being.

Taste is wildly smooth and soothing of peachy/citrus hops, one hell of a nice bittering effect thats very calm and easy. Some light earthy tones dotted in the mix with a blend of well balanced malts, gotta keep those hops in check, I suppose.

very foamy head due to pouring from the keg with a pump tap, this was convenient because the bugs would just walk across the beer, making them very easy to remove :]
otherwise, i stand behind everything i said before [read on]

nice frothy, cream-colored head when poured from the 12 ounce bottle i had the good fortune to obtain (after much prompting from my favorite salesman at the local beer store). the 90 minute ipa is a medium bodied, crisp beer with a bitter, hoppy overwhelmingly great taste, that has the good sense to leave you with litte to no aftertaste. the head, while frothy to begin with, widdled its way down to very little in no time at all. however, the tiny foam bubbles cling to the side of the glass, leaving a small sticky mess for those unfortunate enough not to have a dishwasher.

Big hop aroma, of course, but not as strong as I expected. There is a big, nutty, almond malt type color in the nose too. Starts off a bit on the citrus side, more like sweet oranges with the peels thrown in, rather than a tart grapefruit.

1194,"2003-03-12",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2003 Okay, now it's hoppy as shit but amazingly enough it's not bitter. God I love that hop flavor when it's not masked by overly high IBUs. Well done.  3/12/03 - 3.6: Yeah so my roomates tell me that this bottle I am drinking is a bit off the beaten path from the bottles they have had so far. Considering this is the result of intense hopping I expected something a bit more, well...hoppy. Now, the rediculous amounts of barley malt are most definitely coming through - like a big thick malt bomb amidst a light disapating vapor of floral hops. Damn I'm poetic. Very well rounded, lots of flavor and the label is awesome (is that a real picture!?!). I plan on buying another bottle of this real soon (only $6.50 for the liter at Red Apple) so I'll bump up the rating if needed...so I don't want any nasty messages from people who baptize their children in the shit.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

With the large amount of malt the hops don't just jump out at you, they settle into your palate and stay there long after you've had a drink.

The malt sugars are just to detracting for me to really get into this beer.  Im sorry, this beer is over-rated!  i will say that the palate is very good-no trace of alcohol anyplace!
ReRate-12oz bottle-bottled in september 2003-sampled 1/27/04. pours a deep orange color with long lasting big bubble head.  Aroma of sweet/sour apples/cherries thats very different from most IMP IPAs.  Must have something to do with the english malts and the high alpha acid hops.  Strange palate-full of cherries and somewhat like a belgian beer IMO.  Very sweet, almost detracting.  Apricots?  Did i get a bottle of Aprihop?  Well balanced, but definately a twist on the IMP IPA style.

Copper colour with orange highlights and a dense tan head. Aroma (very potent) of hazlenuts, hops, oak, strong malt and alcohol. Heavy-bodied; Sweet initial flavour then melds to a hoppy kick with oak and tannins. Aftertaste bittering from the hops-but well balanced. Overall, decent-but I  really prefered this in the 75 cL bottle. I didn't really care for this one too much-just another Imperial IPA. Score for this rating: 6,5,6,3,12. 

Cork Finished 75 cL bottle:

The large bone colored creamy/rocky head is fully lasting with stellar lacing.  I could substitute this head for my edge gel next time I shave.  The flavor is colossal.  Everyone showed up for class today: sweetness, warmth, bitter, and spicy.  Very complex with a long bitter finish.  My only knock is that the alcohol was not as well hidden as I prefer.  The medium to full body is creamy and lively.  The finish feels alcoholic.

Brilliant golden amber color, hazy, partially opaque with a fading off-white head.  Flavor has some honeyish, caramel malt sweetness just before the hops come crashing in and and bitter everything up.  Cascade grapefruit is prominent but I'm glad they chose Chinook too, it has such a nice, deep, earthy, spicy, piney herbal character, it's really becoming one of my favorite hop flavors.

A copper body with a thin, tan head.
You can smell the malt with hops, lots of hops. Reminds me of the nose of a good barleywine.
I knew what I was getting into when I poured this beer...90 IBU's. Wish more of the malt stood out in the flavor.

The over malting is balanced by the extreme over hopping. At 9% alcohol and 90 IBU, you would expect this beer to be much harsher and stronger tasting. It is surprising in it mellowness and subtly. Malts have a touch of fruitiness and sweetness to them. Hops are dominant and are floral and slightly spicy. Complex flavors. Thick taste, thick I will be picking hops otta my teeth for a couple of days. Grapefruit flavor intensifies as it warms. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth.

1194,"2002-11-25",4.4,"750 ml bottle, about a year old I believe. Great golden color, almost no head; no ""pop"" on opening either which surprised me.  Aroma is initially just super hoppy/fruity, with orange being dominant to my senses, but as you dig deeper you get some nice caramel and pine also.  Flavor is initially closer to a barley wine than an IPA, very sweet and malty, thick and smooth, with apricots and grapefruit and oranges swirling in your mouth; gradually a piney hoppiness sets in and burns up the back end, but on leaving the tongue for the throat a pleasant warming sensation replaces the burn.

1194,"2002-11-12",5.0,"My own personal ""quest"" for finding 90 Minute IPA was just as great as the beer.  For some time, I was not able to find this beer, and then when a case became available, it was scoffed up before I could buy it.  Ok, now finally to the beer.  I picked up the crazy labeled beer yesterday at my favorite restaurant, Coopers and popped the cork.  Immediately, I was hit with a huge hop aroma.  The beer poured a very deep gold color and was somewhat hazy.  The half inch egg white head lasted and laced the whole way down the glass.  The tasted was hoppy, of course, but as it warmed, a nice maltiness became apparent to balance the taste.  It also finished very creamy as my mouth became accustomed to the hops.  This is a amazing beer and well deserving of a perfect score.  I know that many of you hate to give perfect score, but I think that can be justified for a beer that is just as great to drink as it was hard to find.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"

Update:  Sampled recently in the 12 oz bottle, I found this even more complex--the hop flavor is really incredible.  Lots of herbal and woody notes (not unlike the 60 minute) but a bit more citrus than the 60.  Terribly good.  But I cannot justify rating this higher than Bell's Two Hearted Ale.  Nevertheless, I can certainly understand that many would prefer this one to Bells (or 3 Floyds or Rogue, for that matter).  I'm not one of them.

1194,"2002-05-19",4.3,"My favorite IPA had to date.  Very fresh, piney, spicy flavor.  Some citrus qualities, but very subtle. Heavy and thick mouth feel.  Copper color and quite cloudy (reminds me my my own brews).  Smallish head, maybe I didnt do a good job pouring, and I did have a little trouble uncorking.","Virginia, USA","PTomkinson"
1194,"2002-05-14",4.6,"About 10 months ago a friend asked me if I could brew him a Imperial IPA(his love for high gravity and hops is legendary). I hadnt really ever heard of the style,but since researching it and now finding this monster of an IPA I now ahve to say this a whole category onto its own.I love stout,but when I think back, I relaize I hadnt had stout until I had a Russian Imperial, now I know, I hadnt had I.P.A. until I had 90 Minute!!","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
1194,"2002-05-14",3.7,"Unusual hop-fest from Dogfish.  Feeling threatened by Stones Russian Imperial, the Dogfish folks in Rehoboth, DE, squeezed the juice of 1,000 hops directly into a bottle.  The whole room smelled like hops for awhile.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1194,"2002-05-11",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2014 Big frothy white head, very interesting aroma, and oh-my-g-d that is fricken hoppy! This is the most hoppy beer I have ever had! Crisp, hoppy, and not to malty, fruity, or thick like some other IPAs ive been disapointed in. This is probably the best IPA ive ever had, and 9%abv....wow? Fantastic beer, one of my favorites! Orig rate 5/11/02..4.8. Very clear amber. Caramel, piney, resiny hop aroma. Hop bitterness is highly assertive,  but balance evenly with malt caramel. Body is medium full, with an almost creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is high. Leads into spicy herbal quality, caramel, and hop flavor. Excellent balanced hop flavored yet malty brew.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Davhgbrew"

1194,"2002-05-06",4.1,"Wow - this really floored me...almost literally!  Hops are prominent, but with the deep malt character, dont knock you over like a standard IPA.  Bitterness hits at the end. Nice rounded mouthfeel.  These Dogfish guys really know how to brew!","Ephrata, Pennsylvania, USA","tbookman"
1194,"2002-05-05",3.0,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2009 re rate:  cask sample- hop rind and piney taste with wonderful malt structure, compared to the bottled forum; complex.  Heavy mouthfeel in the beginning takes away from the balance, hops, overpowered with little balance.  Just a beautiful glowing amber color with large bubbled head that has little staying power or stick.  Yeasty, bubble gum, citric, floral nose.  Hits the mouth heavily initially, then finishes bitter and hop tingy.  I must say, it is much better at around 60-65 degrees F.  I will age the others for a few years as this beers flavors need to marry a bit more.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1194,"2002-04-30",4.5,"Liquid hops.  If you like IPAs, youve gotta at least try this one.  Pricey beer, but I doubt too many people can finish it by themselves.  Aroma leaves a little to be desired but WOW, your taste buds will sing!  Dont try to drink anything for a while after this because you wont  be able to taste it.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"
1194,"2002-04-29",4.0,"A bit out of balance but there is plenty of malt.  So an IPA with a attitude- thats saying something.  Hops hit you from the time you open the bottle.  Malt sweetness and the lingering alcohol join in during the tasting.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1194,"2002-04-23",3.6,"Reddish amber. Flowery, citrusy nose. Full bodied, seet, slightly syrupy mouthfeel, and a late bitterness that just keeps growing. Despite its bizarre hop rate it somehow manages to remind somewhat balanced. As usual a very interesting brew from Dogfish Head.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1194,"2002-04-22",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2004 Mad, mad hops. The hops is evident in the nose from arms length. The taste is out of this world. I actually expected it to be too hoppy (if possible) but it was almost balanced out (but not quite.) I had a big corked bottle all to myself and wont ever do such a thing again. I will, however, get another bottle, put it away for a while (as suggested) and share it with a friend in a few months. Go try this with a friend!  Whoa! This recipe changed! While it is still an amazing IPA, this isnt the knock-me-down monster that it was when it had the label with the circus freak hammering the nail into his nose. This is disheartening, but still damn better than most!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
1194,"2002-04-14",4.3,"Big beer but not really an IPA.  The high alcohol content brings this into the range of a barley wine (although it is not a barley wine).  Nice rocky head that lasts over ten minutes.  Very high IBU (90 per label) but balanced nicely by the malt.  Believe it or not, I think it could use more hops.","Hawthorne, New Jersey, USA","Arnoud"
1194,"2002-04-08",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2003 ORIGINAL (12-4-01): This is a love it or hate it beer and I understand why.  This beer is THE absolute hop monster!  The floral, sour apple and grapefruit aromas are overwhelmingly strong and pleasant.  They translate well into the flavor profile.  There is orange peel, grapefruit and a certain fruity sweetness I couldn't quite put my finger on.  These are complimented with some oak and an intensely dry middle and finish.  The only detraction in the flavor is the presence of alcohol, which is clearly evident.  You know it's bitter at 90 IBUs.  The head on this beer is large, off-white and creamy with moderate staying power. The color is cloudy copper to bronze and is beautiful combined with the head.  This beer also has tremendous body and sits heavily on the tongue.  Very viscous.  This is a tremendously hoppy brew throughout, and I love it.  DFH has done it again and I'm going back to the store to buy 2 more bottles to age!  UPDATE (4-8-02):  After aging in my 'cellar' (beer closet) for 4 months, this is a significantly different beer.  The hops, as expected, have mellowed considerably.  Don't get me wrong - they're still bold, but they're no longer completely overpowering and mouth puckering.  The bready and toffeeish malts have shown their presence and the alcohol flavor has run away and hidden.  Reminiscent of a West Coast IPA after 4 months of aging.  Still full bodied and heavy, but it's a more balanced product now.  For those of you who criticized this as overly hoppy, I'd suggest laying it down for several months.  You'll be happy with the results.  UPDATE: (7-25-03)  From the handpump.  Good lord this is amazing stuff.  Hops are softened by the handpump and the beer seems more mellow and creamy.  Still has a nice hop bite and is fairly dry, but it almost seems tame.  Not a hint of alcohol in the aroma or flavor.  Just fantastic.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
1194,"2002-03-29",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2004 I have found my favorite IPA. What a work of art by this extremely creative brewery, one of the finest in the land. This beer pours thick while the powerful smell of the hops overpowers the room. A monumental amount of hops, 90 IBU, and a huge portion of malt balnce to form a beer that defies all presumptions. When is somebody going to interview the brewmaster? 
re-rate: Yeah it's still really good but lacking in some serious bitterness.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

guy driving a nail in his nose. Fresh hops all around here:
in the nose and in the taste. Big bitter taste, as well it 
should with 90 IBUs. A strong alcohol intensifies an already
powerful flavor. Over the top but delicious. Wow.","GERMANY","pivo"

1194,"2002-03-03",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2015  Amazing on the nose, floral and citrusy, very aromatic. Complex body of banana and citrus, fruitcake and understated caramel notes. Lots of alcohol here, but it is well balanced by a huge hop backbone through the long finish. Creamy texture for such a hoppy brew, and perhaps the best balance of toffee malt and citrus of any DIPA out there.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
1194,"2002-03-02",3.8,"Not something youd want to drink everyday.  This is a very interesting beer, and a must-try for those who like their beers big and hoppy.  I picked up three bottles when DFH first released it.  Tried one right off the bat and it was quite a wallop.  Opened a second one about 6 months later and the marriage of flavors had just started to take hold.  Ill crack the third after a year or so just to see how it goes.  As with most beers, this one tastes better on-tap.","Delaware, USA","DeadTerry99"
1194,"2002-02-19",4.5,"Pours a big creamy smooth beige head, sheets of lace, and a cloudy orange color. Nose is floral, spicy, citrus and maybe a tad of yeast showing through.

A bazillion tiny bottles, creeping up the glass with the second pour, interesting beer, and I feel quite complex, but quite quaffable. Thanks JCA","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

1194,"2001-12-23",3.7,"A truly hoppy concoction: strong, floral, citrusy hops, and a ton of bitterness. Some sweet taste once you get past the hops, even a hint of something like strawberries, but its hard to find under all those hops.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
1194,"2001-12-16",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2007 Big and impressive!   The visual presentation was a light amber topped by a soft, whispy white head.   The aroma was a blended concoction of sour grapefruit and big floral, grassy hop notes.  I found the mouthfeel to be rather smooth, full, and round.    The hops dominated the flavor profile, in addition to malt sweetness and strong alcohol tastes.  90 Minute IPA finished with a strong, sustained bitter and some alcohol warmth with a hint of mint.   It was worth a try but I cant see myself shelling out for it again.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","lizziesage"
1194,"2001-11-14",2.9,"Pale Ale color, foamy.  Very nice Pale Ale nose.  Extremely dry hoppy/bitter taste, too dry, really.  I guess Im learning about the contribution of American hops as an element towards imbalance in a quest for galumptuous taste.  Its similar to drinking an overoaked wine lacking basic fruit.  Too bad, though, it sure beats Coors light!","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"
1194,"2001-11-11",3.1,"Amber, brilliant colour; florals, herbs, caramelly nose; body is full of woody bitterness; big flavour with citrus, cascade.

1194,"2001-11-11",3.2,"Cloudy, light golden color.  Floral, supermarket aroma.  Huge hops, woody. I couldnt decide if I liked this or not.  Might be good with something really spicy, but really over hopped, but I think that is what they are aiming for.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
1194,"2001-11-09",4.0,"Massive, massive hops in this one.  Just MASSIVE.  Definitely some maltiness to back it up, but its so hoppy the bitters dry your mouth right after swallowing.  Forms a thick, luscious head.  Very tasty, though (I never thought Id say this) it may be too hoppy.  Still, a hopheads dream brew in many ways.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
