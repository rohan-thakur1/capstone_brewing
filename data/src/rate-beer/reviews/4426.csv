4426,"2017-06-10",4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/5/2016. Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big tart lemon, lime, apricot, peach, mango, pineapple, melon, pear, green apple, white wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, grass, pepper, wet musty funk, wheat, cracker, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, apricots, oak barrel, and moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tart lemon, lime, apricot, peach, mango, pineapple, melon, pear, green apple, white wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, grass, pepper, wet musty funk, wheat, cracker, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light fruity/lactic tartness and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart lemon, lime, apricot, peach, mango, pineapple, melon, pear, green apple, white wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, grass, pepper, wet musty funk, wheat, cracker, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky yeast, apricots, oak barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; with an amazing malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering/astringent flavors after the finish. Light dryness from tart/spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium-plus carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, creamy/grainy, and fairly acidic/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is an insane fruit lambic! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky yeast, apricots, oak barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mellow acidity/tartness. Plenty of funky yeast complexity; with perfectly balanced fruit, oak, and malt notes. A highly amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

4426,"2016-09-14",4.6,"750 mL bottle.. Bottle dated August 19, 2011. Originally reviewed 10/28/2011.

Hazy, murky orange body with an ample, pillowy head. Continuous froth as I drink it. Couldnt look better for a lambic. It even looks the color of an apricot.

Beautiful, subtle apricot aroma. Slight acidity in the aroma. Not much funk, which is disappointing, but its probably what allows the apricot aroma to be so perfect.

Slight apricot flavor immediately overtaken by lambic acidity. A bit of barnyard funk and some hay and wheat flavors. The finish is slightly bitter, but it gives way to a nice apricot flavor in the finish. Its as if the apricot flavor is continuously there, but the lambic comes through and overwhelms it at certain points.

The lightest lambic I have had. Amazingly flavorful for so little body. It really allows the apricot to shine. Perfect carbonation, of course.

Cantillon really does a terrific job with fruit lambics. Theyre more acidic than funky, which allows the fruit to shine. In this case, the fruit flavor is perfect and manages to showcase without being a fruit bomb.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

But there is a layer of mineral stone fruits and bretty, farmy, maybe even cheesy flavour that is all up in the mix as well.

Pure apricots. So much fruit, accompanied by wooden stone qualities, fermented apricots and leathery wood. The nose got a glue like, vinegar whiff to it, accentuating the funky tartness, while its focus remains without a doubt on the fruits.

Perfectly carbonated, with a very refreshing light body.

Taste mirrors the nose, regarding the apricots, revealing apricot pulp, vinegar, vaseline, plastic, soap, glue - all funked up, by leather and barnyard. The nose comes incedibly nice together, again, revealing its fruity characteristics. Finishes tart, dry, with a fermented fruit bitterness, still complimenting the apricots, leaving back a tooth pluckering sourness.

Incredibly well pronounced apricots among a supersoft mouthfeel, wrapped up by a thirst quenching, dry sourness. Refreshing in body, juicy, with a sour lemon peel infusion, leaving with a long lasting, acidic tartness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Temperature was perhaps in the middle of where it needed to be - but I slow drank this one until it moved into the ideal threshold, and thats where it really revealed its depth and complexity. Apricot pits to start this one off , mixed with lactic. Typical lambic funk is modest here, but it is here. White pepper, juice, and grass notes round off the nose. The flavor profile was jarring initially, but we got the palate lined up where it needed to be for this one very quickly. Its musty, dank grasses, light lactic, with a well rounded tartness present. White pepper, earthy oak presence, and apricot juice and skins moving forward to lemon zest.

4426,"2015-01-10",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2015 My 2000th rating. Have had this bottle for about 5 months. Kept in my wine fridge. Ive heard that the fruit fades on this over time, so time to drink it. The pour is golden amber, hazy, with a large light fluffy white foam head which dissipates to thin after a few minutes. Nose is delightful. Theres effervescent soda, sherbet, sour lactobacillus, apricot fruit, slight volcanic mineral note. Its far more delicate, fragrant, light and more balanced than I expected. Really delightful fruit and sherbet nose. I had the fresh apricot Cantillon at GBBF a few years back and it was bolder on the fruit and more straightforward. This is lighter. Taste is sour lactobacillus, apricot fruit, apricot stones, tart sour. The sourness is fairly lip puckering, with just enough fruit to balance it out. Very clean sourness and tartness which is good. Soft and delicate on the palate. Finish is a tingling lactobacillus tartness on the back of the tongue and throat, soda water tingle, minerals. Subtle, clean, light fruity and bold sourness. This is a refined Cantillon, worthy of the reputation. Would like to taste it fresh to get more of the fruit. 19/09/15 - on keg at The Kernel on Zwanze Day. Had a couple of thirds. In the first the fruit was barely there, and it was not far off the regular Cantillon but with a lovely apricot nose, but on the second third maybe further into the keg, theres more apricot fruit. Fou Foune is such a delicate beer and the fruit in the second third was a perfect balance. Just as stunning on keg as it was in the bottle. In a weird co-incidence I managed to bag a bottle on the same day from We Brought Beer in Balham. Score remains 4.4","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

The taste is even more complex, something so rare. Bringing on an apricot universe, zooming into all stages of an apricots beautiful and simple life, from almost still green with this blackthorny sourness via its juicy, sweet and mouthwatering sourish heyday over to the near jam-like overripe stage with tartness being softened by the onset of mildly decomposing spots. Wonderful!

Apricot gelee in the aroma, blending nicely into the lambic aromas. Not that funky. Taste is dry and lambicly sour, but balanced. Very balanced. Medium carbonation! High-level Cantillon brew.From the bottle, Vintage 2003, drank at Erzbierschof Vintage Tasting in October 2014. Damn, goes very much into a Gueuze in terms of funk, and its very sour, but still incredibly fruity.
Fresh 2016 bottle, 2006 bottle and tap at Zwanze 16: 
tap: Very good and lots of apricot jelly, but also some milky yeastiness. On a fresh palate, its great, but next to the bottles, the intensity of flavours was quite weak.

2016 bottle: So much jelly, very creamy. Way tastier than the tap.

2006 bottle: more funk, more apricot, deeper. Funky, more sour. Extremely fruity, but very dry.

2013 version, in 2014.

Tart barnyard quite funky smelling beer with prominent acidity, not a lot of apricot on nose and very faint apricot presence which opens up around 30 minutes later, but still faint. Taste mimicks aroma, but its quite straight ahead and not very complex, acidity, some funk, not much more to it.

This is an extremely well-done fruit lambic. The flavours are integrated, with none of the artificial cough syrup characteristic sometimes found in other lambics or krieks.

4426,"2014-02-05",4.4,"Half bottle  part of a 5-bottle peach/apricot sour blind tasting, Aroma is that classic acidic funk that smells like a barnyard floor, but with a slight citrus, apricot and orange zest twist. The more the beer gets swirled in the glass the more the apricot comes out. The beer pours a cloudy yellow orange with a thin film sitting on top of the liquid. As the beer goes down there are rings of lace left behind. Taste is initially sour, with notes of hay, grass, citrus and finally the lactic apricot flesh. There are lasting flavors of grapefruit, lemon and some barrel tannins. As the beer warms up the tannin flavor gets a bit more aggressive. The body is somewhat creamy with high carbonation. The finish is very dry, sour and zaps all the saliva out of your mouth leaving apricot on your tongue.

Comment: Compared to the other fruit lambics from Cantillon (or from anywhere really) this one stands out as one of the best.

4426,"2013-10-01",4.7,"2012 Vintage Poured into Cantillon Stemware at 45 degrees. 

A- Very hazy orange (apricot skin) with a white head about an eighth of an inch thick that doesnt seem to want to go away. Vigorous carbonation is evident, the bubbles seem to be rising to the surface at a champagne-like rate. No lacing is evident. 

S- Classic cantillon barnyard with a citrus acidity similar to orange zest. Apricots are very evident as well, providing a sweet, tropical note to the funky lactic overtones. 

T- I dont even know where to begin. Extremely complex. While the apricot is very mellow on the nose, it comes through with a huge tart stone fruit mixed with lemon zest and orange peel. Pretty much, Im trying to say it tastes like apricots without saying the word apricot. After the apricot flavor dies off, there is an earthy flavor that makes way for a huge blast of lemon zest and lactic acidity that leaves you looking like a sour patch kid. A good two minutes after a sip, I can still feel the tingly sensation you get in your face after downing a whole bag of sour skittles and then eating the dust in the bottom of the bag. For someone who used to eat lemons as a young child, this beer is a dream come true. 

M- Prickly carbonation with an extremely dry finish in addition to the extremely sour notes from the taste. I am literally sitting here sweating because of the level of puckering.

O- The aroma and flavor are absolutely the best part of this beer, which is nice since those are usually the two biggest factors in a beer for me. This one definitely looks great as well, but with the huge apricot aromas and the complex stone fruit flavors bouncing around with the brett funk and huge acid, the flavor and aroma are what make this a world-class beer. Im glad I got to down a whole bottle of this by myself instead of the half ounce pour I was lucky enough to have at a tasting earlier this year.","","justforrazors"

4426,"2013-04-08",4.0,"750ml bottle from last year. Pours a pale orange with white head. Aroma is light on the distinctive wild notes but fruity apricot plus white grape notes come through nicely. A bit of a let-down here though. Taste-wise this is gorgeously fruity to begin with and progressively wilder as the bottle empties. As ever superbly balanced and refined. The last Cantillon I had was at the 7 year mark whereas this is barely 7 months, and the differences are really apparent. I think the sweet spot is probably somewhere in the middle. Id like to try this again with more age: long enough for the wild side to come through more but before the fruit fades away.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"

Easily the best off-the-shelf, fresh Cantillon lambic.  Wish I could drink Fou all day, every day. :(","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

The nose has some funky barnyard notes along with a very light fruity note.  The flavor is classic Cantillon with lots of musty barnyard funkiness paired with a tangy peach/apricot note.

Pours a deep clear golden color with a huge white head that slowly dissipates but remains a cap on the top. The aroma is quite tart with lemons and sour apricots dominating the nose. A solid hit of funk and light plastic phenol round out the nose. The flavor is fruity with apricots with a lemony tartness and hints of sour cherries and plums. A solid hit of horsey funk round out the flavor nicely. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel.

4426,"2012-10-28",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2012 Bottle @ Armins bachelor party. Thanks Armin! This was the 2009 vintage, I believe. Pours a fairly bright, cloudy yellow orange appearance with a white head. Somewhat juicy, stone fruit/apricot/peach fruity, light vanilla, a touch woody, very sour, mild barnyard aroma. The flavor was tasty but was so overly acidic that it was a bit hard for me to enjoy. Tons of peaches and apricots but they werent as apparent as I would have liked due to the huge acidity. There was some funk and barnyard underneath, but again, it really just seemed a bit too much for my taste. That being said, I really would love to try this again and preferably fresh. (3.9)

Had on tap at Local Option during their Occupy the Local Option. Served in a mini-snifter.

A: Pours a hazy golden color with dreamsicle like hues intertwined. The head is bubbly, airy and bone white in color. It recedes to a thick collar and leaves some splotchy lace.

S: Musty, earthy and funky in nature. There is a light apricot tartness and some under ripe apple skin as well. 

T: Subtle apricot flesh with a funky, barnyard like flavor. There is a mild tartness that is coupled with an oak and vanilla like sweetness on the finish.

M: Creamy up front with a drying, tannic finish. Spritzy carbonaton and a light body makes for a nice drinking brew.

O: The flavors seemed slightly muted overall and it didnt wow me like I thought it would. It was still an above average lambic, but I expected more fruity flesh and a little more tartness.

4426,"2012-08-26",4.4,"Bottle cork dated 2011 and on the label bottled August 25 2011, almost a year ago to the day. Big thanks to the trader that sent this one my way!

Aroma has nice punchy apricot, apricot skins, mild acidity, mild sweet tropical punches, and some yeast. It really draws you in with the complexity. Mouth feel is light and the carbonation medium and it has held up well under the ridiculous amount of swirling and smelling done to it. Flavor is much bigger on the acidity than anticipated and has big pucker factor to go with it. The fruit is still intact and battles back with some countering sweetness, bitter skins, and citrus rind.

4426,"2012-08-02",4.0,"bottled April 2011. after having this batch twice in January at Avenue Pub in New Orleans, I decide to get around to a proper rating since I cant remember my previous one well enough.

early pour: lightly hazed golden body with a small film of a white head, quickly dying with no lasting retention.  first smell is some sort of strange calcium, dried fruit and concerte must.  the calcium, its almost like carbonic acid, smelling like an apricot-flavored soda, tingling and prickling the nose.  the fruit character is certainly apricot, though its partially muted and obscured by the yeast, which is lactic and brett-heavy in character, but also showing signs of butryic acid.  to be honest, the smell of the first pour lacks depth and comes across as apricot soda.  medium-full body with pronounced chewiness but high dryness gives it a syrupy / oily texture. lactic acid is sharp and brett seems to contribute small amounts of must and plastic. the finish, while quenching and salivating from the acid, leaves an oily film of soured apricot juice.  carbonation froth across the back is as magical as any Cantillon, though, and for me seems to be the high point of this beer.

late pour: some lemon rind pastry flavors start appearing, and the lactic acid seems to amplify, griping the entire mouth.  the oiliness is present more, and the dry apcicot flavor in the finish combined with the quenching acid is ridiculously enjoyable.  alas, the nose seems to move away from the apricot and show more of the lactic acid and calcium than before, but overall it doesnt change much between early and late pours as most other Cantillons.  its certainly a delicious lambic, and interesting to see the microflora play with the apricots, but I find myself preferring the more rich and pulpy raspberries in the Rose and pittiness of the cherries in Lou Pepe Kriek more than the apricots here.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Both vintages pour a hazy pale yellow color. Both have a thin off white head with some spotty lacing.

4426,"2012-03-09",4.4,"Got this in a trade. THANKS RYAN! Went through extreme palate cleansing tactics prior to opening it up. Poured into a Flute and Ommegang Glass (sharing with the GF). Temp is about 50 degrees F in the glass. Bottle Date: August 18th, 2011

A - Beautiful orange bronze color pouring out of the bottle. Even on a slow pour, very champagne like bubbles rose to the top of the champagne flute and produced a 3 finger crystal clear head that subsided to a half a finger creamy line of bubbles on the top. In the glass, the beer resembles that of peach pulp with a perfect orange to brown haze and light clear bubbles around the edges of the glass.

S - Very light tartness on a first whiff. Delicious peach juice scent and some hints of tangerines and floral like lavender or rose petals. Of course theres apricot but Im getting peach. On the nose a very tart feeling hits the back of my nostrils and sticks around for a while. Very pleasant and not overpowering.

T - Naturally, the sour and tart hit the tongue first but theyre not intense like most Lambics Ive had. The 2nd bit is a waft of apricot. More of those really great floral scents. The tartness doesnt stick around very long. Its gone pretty fast. The traditional over tartness I get from non-Cantillons just isnt here. Its balanced, hints of very juicy fruits and terrific tartness.

M - The beer converts entirely to carbonation on a single mouth swish and more apricot pulp flavors are released on that swish. Linger is orange and tart and it fades away after a minute or so.

O - Sorry for the long review but I may never get this beer again. I may have hyped it up in my head a bit too much but this is still a phenomenal beer and one of the best lambics Ive had...possibly #1.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4426,"2012-03-06",4.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/9/2011.  Poured from a caged and corked 750 mL bottle into a tasting glass. 

This has a very elegant hazy golden yellow appearance in the glass. With its translucence it appears almost angelic, although I might just be thinking that because I am so excited to try it. A ring of white head rests in the edge of the glass, remaining mellow and not bothering to leave much lace.

This aroma is fantastic, just the perfect balance for a summer beer. A little bit sour, with just a hint of funk, there is a ton of apricot that screams refreshment.

The flavor is really a progression of apricot. Up front it starts sweet, like biting into a ripe apricot. It shifts to become more sour, gaining momentum from an acidity that starts in the periphery and eventually makes me pucker. On subsequent sips this sensation subsides and I distinguish some lactic sourness and a light mustiness at the end. 

The body to Fou Foune is light to medium, with a good amount of carbonation that is mostly creamy but provides a bit of crispy pep as well. Overall in line with what I want from a beer of this nature. Fairly dry and tart.

It is a cruel joke that this beer is so hard to come by in the United States. I am beginning to wonder if I should move to Belgium just to be able to drink Cantillon all the time. Seriously.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Cloudy light orange beer, small fizzy white head, unstable, dissipates immediately. Aroma: fruity and sour, typical geuze, almost sour kriek smell. No apricots though. Taste: pretty sour, distinct Cantillion flavours, lemon, lime zest, bitter touch and pretty fruity. Still no apricots though.

4426,"2012-02-22",4.6,"750 ml bottle from trade with Kyle. Pours a cloudy apricot color with a small white head that quickly dissipates to zilch.

The taste is rich and complex with a myriad of sour fruit sensations; i get, apples, grapes, apricots, grapefruit and mangoes. All nicely sour and funky. As I progress through the bottle the apricot flavor, which was barely discernible at first, gets bolder and bolder. The palate is full and silky smooth with lively carbonation. Finishes long and pleasantly sour with an aftertaste of big bold apricots. Overall: Lambics are not my strong suit, and sometimes I question whether or not I could spot a good one.

Im not detecting the apricot as strongly as I thought I would, its there but it mingles in with the other fruit aromas. The aroma has a funk and  I like it. Taste is so dry and tart...................lip smacken good. Apple, funk, leather, apricot, the sour lingers perfectly on the tongue. This is an easy beer to drink. Light bready malts seem to keep the sour in check......but I think the sour is winning. Took a 20min beer break and the after taste seemed to turn to vinegar. Just poured the last half of the bottle and beer looks tan/grey/ and not clear at all. Aroma has much more pronounced and sweeter apriocot now. And WOW!! the taste got 10X more funky and sour.

The 2005 is much more tart and sour, almost like a geuze and not a fruit lambic but you do get some distant apricot, mostly in the aroma and very faint as a flavor.

I preferred the 2011 but I am currently being introduced to the sour world :D However the 2005 was quite lovely too, On the label though it says that it is recommended to try it within a year of production, so the fruity experience is what the creator had in mind.

Poured out a hazy light... well I guess I actually have to call it apricot in colour with a large sizzling white cap. Interesting mellow aroma: minerally, warm apricots.. the apricots change with density and sweetness as you inhale the goodness and jam your nose deeper into the glass. The sweet side comes out the strongest just before you fill your lungs all the way. Mellow apple and a sweet bread side with the sour notes not making too much of an impact. After a lengthy sit I almost got tricked into thinking there was mushed berries in here. Trippin to Herbie Hancock - Inventions & Dimensions. The taste is very, well, tasty. Bready finish with permanent sour lingerings. Sour tartness that does not kill yet leaves some dryness and a need for perpetual mouthfuls. The sweetness of the apricots seemingly keep everything in check, light light funk, sourness without the attitude, crab apples with some attitude. This smells way more like physical fruit once I dumped in the sludge. This be good yum. I dig. good carbs, good everything.

A - This body has a cloudy, almost syrupy appearance to it. The color is somewhere between gold and pale orange. There was a short lived white head that led to some tight edging. Swirling yields some lively carbonation and some lacing. Looks fantastic!

S - As soon as I popped the cork I could smell the apricots. Super intense apricot aroma. It smells more like the dried variety than fresh apricots, as it almost has some candy notes to it. The finish is fairly acidic with a touch of brett funk. You can tell this is going to be a sour beer.

T - More of that dried apricot sweetness. Just a massive fruit presence. The finish is sour and acidic. Not a lot of funk or brett flavors to speak of. A bit better than the aroma.

M - Very lively and spritzy. The carbonation is perfect, and the body has some weight to it which is great for these flavors.

O - This is the best fruit lambic I have ever had. It really captures the apricots, and I cant imagine aging this any longer as the fruit sweetness is perfect. However, its not as mind shattering as I thought it would be. Is it worth $28 and the hunt of landing a bottle? Probably not...but it is delicious and really well made.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Cloudy apricot colour with a soft white head. Soft, lightly sour fruit scent. Sourness is strong at first but then becomes as much a part of each sip as the solid apricot flavour.

The apricot flavor is still there, but when fresh it tastes like apricot juice. Of course, that is mixed with the funky flavor that is present in all the Cantillon line. Not sure what to make of the age on this. I like it fresh, but it does still taste good with some age. The couple year old one I had did not really have any apricot flavor or aroma left in it.

Pours very light, yellowish, very small and light white head with a pretty good retention. Looked extremely fizzy (3)
Aroma is a bit overwhelming on the side, as far as sourness-to-come is concerned, but apricot is still pretty perceptible (....obviously). Taste is borderline overwhelmingly sour with an heavy dose of apricot == things becomes interesting when you can taste the subtles wine, wood and vanilla. You have to work, though. The finish is probably where it gets even more awesome, with the wood taking as much place as the apricot. (8)
Really watery mouthfeel and reasonable carbonation -- lets face it, to much carbonation on this one wouldnt work at all. .... Extremely sour.(4)

A - Pours murky light orange with a big two finger tall white head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.
S - Smells of lots of sourness, sharp apricot and even some peach, light funk, and some dry oak tannins. I would have preferred just a bit more fruit but it isnt a huge deal really.

A - this lambic was poured into a snifter glass that I drink pretty much every one of my classy beers from. The appearance of this beer was exquisite. It looked exactly like the inside of an apricot (maybe a tinge lighter than the real fruit). Not much head to speak of on this beer (1/8 of a finger of head). Some carbonation beads trailing up the sides of the beer. 

S - you can smell that cellar funk that is common with many Cantillon brews. Really the smell of this lambic was the only thing that didnt impress me. There was a faint apricot smell to the beer and some sweet notes as well. 

T - a very impressive taste to this beer. You can really taste the apricot in the beer. There is some sweetness in the beer, but nothing that is overpowering. Upfront, there is that cellar funk that comes from the wild yeast., but that quickly disappears. What you are left with is a strong apricot essence with an accompanying pleasing sweetness. 

M - there is some carbonation in this beer, but nothing that is overpowering. As you swish it around your mouth, it feels very smooth and not at all watery. You can really tell that they have packed a lot into this beer. 

O - what can I say? My introduction to Cantillon brews was a success. I use to think (in my younger days) that Lindemans was the essence of what a lambic should be. I realized later that beers should pull their greatness from natural ingredients and not added sugar. Cantillon really shows that natural ingredients can come together to make a beer that really puts the fruit it was aged with in the forefront.","Florida, USA","ajcobb24"

Unfortunately, this fulfills my concerns about fruit lambics and aging them; the beer lacks any discernible apricot flavor or aroma and just ends up tasting like unblended, extremely sour and lactic lambic.

4426,"2011-05-11",4.6,"2010 375ml Japanese edition bottle shared with Weisguy & lamplighter for one of our small weekly tastings.
Served slightly chilled, a huge head appeared on a fast pour decanted into one glass to share between the three of us. Hard to tell how much sediment was left, but I would guess 1-2 ounces. Color was a light yellow with a gold hue up to the light with a couple tiny bits of sediment swimming around. Smell was sharp fruit and some vinegar. Described by Ari as ""smelling a peach pit."" Notes of peach and apricot skin were very evident. The taste was an intense combination of resiny sour apricot and fruity acidity, while much funk was almost nowhere to be found. Unnoticeable alcohol on the palate and finish, but a slight burn from the acidity was present. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and Im sure it would have been a cinch for any of us to drink over a liter of this. Ive had Foufoune a few times (many courtesy of Weisguy), including a fresh 750 of the 2010 bottling, but this bottle stood out as nearly a whole nother beer than what I tasted before. Much more fruit on the nose and tongue, while the balanced acidity made for a very enjoyable lambic.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","sarro"

The head is white, rises about a finger and is gone pretty quickly...The aroma is on the lighter side, light tart fruits, mixed with sourness. Not overpowering in either regard so its balanced giving some of what you look for in a fruit lambic...Holy moses, thats one sour beer. Didnt think it would be that tart from the aroma. Its got a huge tart bite sour, not a mucky horse blanker leather like a lot of Cantillons. Here you get a lot more of the fruit not sweetness but the actual taste of apricots on the finish. Super balanced and flavorful...The feel is great, sticks to the mouth, very tannic...Drinkability is off the charts. It gives me everything I love about a lambic, sourness funk, but balanced enough that you can drink this all day, while at the same time not being such a fruit beer thats its super sweet or dominated by the apricot...Overall one of my favorite lambics, right up there with Blabear.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

4426,"2011-03-02",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2016 Rerate November 2016: 2016 vintage, 75cl bottle picked up at the brewery. It pours a mostly clean bright apricot color with a minimal white head. Aroma is full of tangy citric notes, light musty basement funk, stone fruit, apricot marmalade. Taste is initially citric, acidic, softly sweet and fruity with a mostly indefinite stone fruit note, light passion fruit, more funky basement and lemon juice. The bottom of the bottle is hazy and juicy with loads more acidity and clean concentrate apricot jam notes, only slightly muddled by the earthy yeast tones. As the beer warms up, also the initial pours start to show more apricots, jammy pulpy fruits and a little more funk. I think this years batch is at it sweet spot for fruitiness right now, having cleaned the ""green"" bitter notes it had initially 2 months ago. Letting it sit will open up more funk and tartness, also looking forward to that. Score: 4.5
Rerate September 2016: 2016 vintage drank super fresh at Zwanze 2016, Kernel, London. It pours a hazed apricot color with a small white head. Aroma is tangy fruity acidic with lemon peel and light peachy jammy fruits. Taste is also tart acidic and lightly fruity jammy peachy with notes of stone fruits and lemon peel. A closing bitterness ruins the long acidic finish accompanied by jammy apricots notes which Ive come to love in this beer. Overall, feels too ""green"" and fresh, hopefully will improve with time. Score 3.8
Rerate September 2015: 2015 vintage extra fresh at Zwanze Day. This was my beer of the night hands down. Super smooth, plenty of apricots in both the nose ad the taste. Clean lemony sourness but never too acidic. Amazing Cantillon lambic with unique apricots twist, might just be my favourite beer. Score 4.5
Rerate August 2012: 2012 vintage, drank in 2012, was much less harsh on the acidic side. The nose and taste were much more rounded with apricot sweetness, but it lacked the final apricot-concentrate like kick that I thoroughly enjoyed in my 2007 vintage. Good fresh for sure, but I think I preferred the aged version. Score 4.0
Original rate from 2011: 75cl bottle. 2007 vintage. Pours a cloudy orangish color with a big fizzy white head. Aroma is mostly sweet-sour with oak and horse blanket qualities. As it warms up, apricots become more present and the residuals  on the bottom of the bottle are pure apricots juice. Taste is sweet/sour, almost lemon peel. Grassy earthy notes. Fruity sweetness is subtle but definitely perceivable if compared to regular Cantillons lambics and certainly helps to balance a bit the flavors. Medium bodied and lots of carbonation.Very refreshing but at same time complex brew. Stunning. Score 4.2","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

Hazy golden straw in color, decent amount of crisp white head with a decent amount of retention. It sticks around in small trellice on the edges.

Smells sweet and fruity (apricot, peach) with a little bit of barnyard funk/straw and just a hint of acidic sourness.

Taste is mellow and smooth up front but builds to a nice sour tartness with a slight acidity in the middle of the taste. The finish has barnyard funk and a fruity apricot flavor. Very nice balance in here, nothing overpowers. The sourness is subtle, the funk is subtle, and the apricot is subtle. This creates just a beautifully balanced, easy drinking, lambic.

The body is more on the thin side, really slight carbonation which is perfect for style. I wouldnt want a change to this. Crisp and refreshing with only a tinge of acidic bite

4426,"2010-12-29",4.1,"Bottled 08/8/2010. Consumed 12/15/2010. 

Pours paler than I imagined. Fou Foune is not cloudy, but shes certainly not transparent either. The color is a slightly muted Dandelion; Jonquil is probably the best descriptor available. Even at first pour, theres a nice half finger head that settles into a frothy ring.  

The nose excites and is certainly more fruit-forward than I remember. Sweet apricots, fresh, sugared peaches, a managed citrus acidity, and some floral notes. Almost no funk whatsoever. 

Muted apricots, citrus, and the pits of prunus fruits, which I think is a result of the oak acting on the fruits: peach, apricot, almonds. Not overly acidic, but it has some citric and lactic acid bite to it. Im not sure if malic acid is here, but I pick up on that fresh, green apple tartness characteristic of it. Nice ascescence without the accompanying astringency found in some sour beers; its almost puckering, but without tannin presence. Theres some minor chalkiness that provides body mid-palate. 

Quite light and refreshing, as expected. Just under medium carbonation. Dry throughout the palate.

Apricot comes through strongly in the nose, but even now, at a few months, the taste is mostly comprised by citric and malic acidity reminiscent of lemons/green apple. Its oaky and its dryness brings out the fruit-pit flavors sometimes caused by brett, but I get little funkiness.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

Funky hints of hay, definatelly sour then some more sour... theres a tiny hint of fruit, but its just  a subtle note.  Nice even tongue punching palate.  Hugely sour beer, more a sour than a fruit.  Nice puckering cheek feel.  A lighty funky hay touch w/ some tiny touch of fruits.

Additional light herbaceousness, soft lemon, stonefruit pits, and sweet nectar are also present.  The flavor is sharply tart with stonefruit notes, barrel-aged oxidation, and a faint spiciness.

Hands down the finest lambic named after a womans nether regions. Reeks of an apricot tree - bark and all. Tastes of stone fruit and fruit stones. The funk is a given. 

But this one is not that puckering. Dont get me wrong - its sour. But on a scale of one to five, one being mild empuckerment and five being total facial implosion, this is about a 3.5. Time has stripped the fruit of its tartness.

Fantastic nose with bits of sour lemons, oak, sharp musty cheese and hay from a medieval horse stable.  Flavor is potently acidic with a pervasive sourness that hits the roof of your mouth and cascades down into your jowls.  Tastes like tart dried lemons with the apricot flavor having worn off after three years in the bottle.  Brett funk is heavy in the nose, but doesnt come through as much in the flavor.

4426,"2010-05-23",3.8,"750ml bottle purchased from Liquid Solutions. Cork says botted in 2007, sampled 12/14/08.

Appearance: Slightly peach colored hazy golden pour. Quite lemon looking with an overall fine foam head.

Smell: Rotten eggs, slightly over ripened apricot, yeast, mild barnyard funk.

Taste: Exactly like the nose but the egg note is minimized and the barnyard note is increased.

Mouthfeel: Very refined, sophisticated, creamy, delicate.

Drinkability: Very approachable considering the style.

I think the apricot sweetness would disappear completely with any additional age put on this one. But the sharpness and dryness would continue to develop. Its already fairly sharp and dry so who knows what extremes it could reach! Definitely not a low class sweet fruit lambic. This is a winner.

T: Love in a glass. Tons of earthy apricot with a nice level of tartness. Lightly acidic with strong citrus notes and peach pits. Really is a joy to drink.

M: On the lighter side of medium, somewhat dry finish.

D: Good, this one was served in a small proper cantillon glass. I could easily sit back and enjoy an entire bottle though. One of my favorite sours.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"

Very hazy orange color with a reasonably big white head that leaves plenty of lacings.

The smell is really acidic with lots of tart fruit notes of lemon, apricots and some green apples. Lots of funky notes as well, mostly mud and blanket. Very intense.

The taste is almost unbelievably sour, really mouth-puckering. Lots of acidic fruit notes, mostly of apricots and lemon. Pleasant rustic funky notes of mud and wet hey. Notes of grass and wood. The finish is bone dry, and I really mean bone dry. The beer ends with tart notes of apricots, hints of salty aged cheese, mild grassy bitterness and lingering acidity.

Medium body, rather sparkling carbonation.

Ive had this beer once before, but I was still amazed over how sour it is. By far one of the most sour beers Ive tried. All in all, its a great beer - wonderful fruity character and intense rustic flavors.

Flavor unleashes a full assault of tartness on the tongue. Vinegar, apricot, cider, and acidity run rampant throughout the duration of the flavor. Palate is astoundingly rude; I had to brace myself for each sip, but I reveled in that difficulty. Wondrous lambic, but certainly not for the faint of heart.

I have one of this sittiing in the cellar but now that someone shared one I may trade it off.  This is a great Cantillon as the scores indicate but for their level of quality not the best.  Given the price tag I would rather have a bottle of any of the Lou Pepe lineup instead.  If you like interesting experiments in different fruits however give it a try.

Aroma / Appearance - Cloudy orange as I expected it to be the body is flat and lifeless.  The sour apricot aroma is nowhere near as intense as many other Cantillon lambics but still sharper than many from other breweries.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would put it around a 7.  It still retains that classic Cantillon vinegar character just without the lingering intensity.

Flavor / Palate - Apricots, as expected, dominate the profile from start to finish.  Not as sour as even the nose suggests this is relatively easy to drink for a classic lambic.  The biggest difference is the lack of acidity in the finish.  Perhaps this will come with time in the bottle but usually Cantillon beers have that kick from the start.  From any other brewer this would be a great release.  For Cantillon I would place this as ""yet another average"" lambic which is to say that if you find it on sale be sure to buy it ASAP.  Just dont expect the same experience as with many other beers in their lineup.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4426,"2009-11-25",3.6,"750ml bottle (best before 12/2018) from Nectar in Brisbane (recommended). A hazy dark orange pour with a very stable thin white head that laces well. Aroma is typical Brett yeasts, wheat, lemons, damp wood and subtle apricots. The tongue is rather harsh tart flavours of lemons, lactic acid and a hint of vinegar. The finish is sour and long lasting. It is medium bodied with a smooth oily texture. I often complain about the artificial sweetness of the more commercial fruit lambics but this is certainly not a problem with this beer. In fact it tastes more like an oude geuze than a fruit lambic in my opinion - more sour lemons than sweet apricots.","FNQ, Australia, ","floydian1"

Chilled in the fridge and poured into a large snifter.  Beautiful cloudy orange amber color.  Aroma...aroma..cough...well, ahem.  After brewing 7 sours and noticing my own mistakes, and loving Cantillon for years, Im starting to notice some undesirable (to me at least) aromas in Cantillon beers.  Of course there is the initial wonderful sour aroma, with a hint of acetic acid, which I like.  Apricots are very difficult to discern in taste or aroma, but probably you can see it in the color.  Next in full force in the aroma is a vegetal skunky aroma.  Ive smelled in my ciders and one of my Berliner Weisses.  Very remiscent of the garlic of Saaz hops, but it could be remnants of enterobacter production of DMS, though I would hope this would fade after the 1-2 years of barrel aging.  It could be something related to aged hops.  Whatever.  Even though Im trying hard to avoid the DMS aroma in my sours (and I never notice it in American sours), Foufoune is still very good.  Dryness amplifies the sourness like a young tart peach.  Easy to drink.  If money were no issue, I buy more, but since money is an issue, Ill stick to brewing more sours at home.

Somewhat irritated by this, I thought I should order two, one to savor at my table and one to unflinchingly pour down my throat in an instant while he watched, to show him what kind of stuff I am made of.  A sort of beer geek spite.  After having sufficiently convinced the bartender that I was worthy of a glass, he changed his tone and began to give me his own analysis, which I did not want or need.  I took the beer back to my seat, and began drinking it.  It took me about an hour to get through the 250ml, partly because it was so intense and extreme, partly because I wanted to prolong this glorious experience.  Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with very little head.  Ultra-sour, funky champagne-barrel musty woody aroma with a tinge of nondescript tree-fruit.  Slightly citrusy perhaps.  The flavors were punishingly sour, with only the slightest hint of apricot.  It seems that the apricot, and its delicate and subltle flavors, are well-suited to provide a fruity background character to lambic beers, but cannot ""shine through"" the funk.  Absolutely bone dry super tart finish.  That was probably the most interesting aspect of this beer.  The finish was abrupt and dry, but tickled the taste buds just enough to produce an intense craving for more and more.  This is the hallmark Cantillon experience.  This is the cornerstone of any sour beer addiction, in my opinion.  It is sour candy for the adult beer geek.  Amazing, as are most Cantillon brews.  But this one had something extra special...","San Diego, California, USA","DarkMagus"

Having this one close to the BBC peach was an eye-opener in terms of how to do it up right. Not that we didnt know that (know that!) but here we have a vivid demonstration. I actually think the qualities of this particular fruit are far more apposite to this style of beer than some raters, and so I think the particular blend of woods, fruit, and fizzy tart lambic works extremely well here.

The flavor is of the same dried apricots found on the nose with the addition of bitter apricot pit and an over-the-top tartness that diminishes my enjoyment of what otherwise is a very nice beer.

Served lightly chilled in a pilsner style glass.

Fresh sweet apricots hit the nose first, ripe and very tasty. Zesty citrus, damp woody funk, vinegar play in the background.
Ferocious acidity attacks the taste buds, as is the Cantillon way, bone-dry, lively carbonation without being sharp, excellent length.
Flavours become more focused and coherent on the body. Lemon rind, creamy cheese, cider vinegar, dried fruit particularly apricot, damp wood/cork, slightest hint of developing sweatiness towards a lengthy acidic dry finish. Begs another sip!

Peach (though Im sure that is the apricots, I dont know what an apricot smells like), oak, vanilla, some citrus (orange, lemon.)  Taste, whoa.  Whoa.  This is so peachy, and sooo so sour, I can feel my cheeks puckering relentlessly way in the back of my mouth.  This is pretty acidic, I think I can already feel my stomach churning a little bit and I definitely feel it in my chest.  But still... I absolutely love this.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
4426,"2008-10-11",4.1,"750ml.  21Aug06.  Pours a hazy dull orange/peach color with a lot of bubbles when I pour but has zero retention.  No head to speak of after a minute and not a bubble in sight.  Aroma shows significant funkiness.  Normal Cantillon critters, Gueuze-like.  Cider, urinal, hay and barnyard, musty cherries, lemonade.  Some fruitiness as well, citrusy.  I think I get some Apricot or Peach when I smell this but it didn’t jump out at me if I wasn’t looking for it. At warmer temperatures a rubber band aroma develops, though not negative. This thing smells acidic.  It’s certainly satiating my funk/sour craving.  Flavor is huge apricot, really well integrated fruit flavor following and preceding intense sourness.  Lip puckering tartness, though not overdone.  Lemony, super acidic with a dry finish.  This is quite impressive how sour this is yet how it still manages to have such a rounded and defined apricot taste.  One of the more intense lambics I’ve ever had when it comes to sourness.  I certainly can’t think of any sourer.  This is another knockout from Cantillon.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
4426,"2008-09-27",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2010 Update.  2006 vintage, consumed in September 2010.  Dear lord, this is a ridiculously bad ass beer.  It just keeps getting better and better with age.  This most recent experience displayed an initial softness to the fruit that wasnt present in its brash, youthful state.  Still, the groundswell of intensity builds with each sip, bordering on full-out sour apricot beauty amidst a complex citrus gueuze-like finish.  Excellent stuff.  Note to self.....acquire more of this by whatever means necessary.  This might just be my favorite fruit lambic of all time.Original rating (circa 2008, from both fresh draft and year old bottles).  A clear, glistening, golden-orange body is topped with a thin, wispy film with a bubbly, off-white rim.  Sudsy micro-spots of lace show like constellations in the night sky.  As soon as liquid hits glass, an explosion of sour fruits and barnyard funk dart for the nose.  Intense lambic sourness attacks relentlessly, while scents of sun warmed apricot skins and acidic apple cider vinegar fight through the lingering, cloudy, farmhouse funk.  The first sip comes with a cringe inducing, mouth puckering assault.  This stuff is heavy duty sour.....sucking on a lemon sour......but if you can handle it, you are rewarded with luscious, juicy apricot, nectarine and green apple goodness.  The light carbonation and classic lambic body are perfect, as any fizziness would surely intensify the acidic punch beyond tolerable levels.  This is a fantastic beer, but make sure you are well versed in sours before you go anywhere near this bad boy.  You have to crawl before you can sprint.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
4426,"2008-09-24",3.4,"(bottle, thanks Badgerben!) Pours a fairly still yellow.  The aroma is all over the board, scents of freshly cut avocado, garlic, dried apricot, and the characteristic Cantillon barnyard funk.  The taste was too sour and abrasive for me.

This is definitely the most sour beer I’ve tried.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

4426,"2008-09-10",3.9,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle, vintage 2003.  Thanks Ben!  A dusty dandelion yellow, soft and luminous.  Sweet-tart apricot skin aroma with an intimidating array of wild oddities beneath; banana pepper skins, pickled ginger and garlic cloves, pineapple rinds; amidst the characteristic dryness of mineral yeasts, theres a pillow-soft goat cheese tang for it all to swim and settle in.  

Flavor is a raging swell of sour acidity, with a lacquer of fruit, honey, and flowers that lends a needed delicacy to the middle, to settle the violence of the acetic acids for a moment; still, the barren wood acidity and its wild heat that tends to dominate many of these not-yet-very-old Cantillons remains on furious display here; huge amounts of hot lemon juice, champagne vinegar, and pissy white wine.  Altogether one of the sourest experiences yet, and certainly harrowing, and stunning.

Oily, medium body; softly carbonated; adhesive, vinegar-cured peppers and general raw sourness in a very long finish.  A swift kick in the ass and sometimes the throat; sometimes an epiphany and sometimes an attack.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Aroma is funky, citrusy and nice sour peach/apricot - none of that artificial fruit you get from some of lesser lambics (and I’m not even talking about the horribly sweet Lindeman’s versions).  Love that funk.

The taste is quite tart and relatively clean.  Yummy funk and sour apricots.  Soft wheat-like character upon warming.

Sourness is not quite as sharp as on fresher bottles, but you could argue this is a good thing.  My preference - nice and sharp.  Age treats it very well though, so you won’t go wrong aging a bottle.

The aroma was big of apricots, acidic sourness, and some funk. The aroma doesnt prepare you for the onsluaght of sourness to follow. The flavor was all of sour apricots and peaches with the acidity and sourness dominating the taste. There is a good amount of funk in there as well with all the sourness. It was enough to make you pucker up from all the sour taste. It was medium bodied with a sour dry finish with a nice long aftertaste. I really enjoyed this one, am digging the sour stuff.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Its ok, Ive come to expect it from these guys.  The flavor is much the same.  I got just the slightest little apricot flavor because the funk and sourness is so overpowering, its toug to pull out other flavors.

Tasted initially very acidic which took a while to wane but it did and then a strident fruitiness started to flood through with soft fleshy overripe apricots becoming more and more noticeable. This was a nice lambic but I felt that it needed time, initially I wasnt so fussed but owing to it being a rather large 750ml bottle I noticed that after 45-60 mins later it started tasting so much better. With time the vicious acid bite at the start seemed to mellow a touch obviously that was the case of ones palate getting used to it but also I like to think that maybe a bit of air and the slowing down of that carbonation might have helped.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

The flavour sour and salty, with vibrant overtones of strong acidic citrus, but not  so acidic that it resembles acetic acid. The apricots are very subtle.

Aromas of light fruits that include apricots, peach, kiwi and unripe bananas are all notable but deeply buried under heavy funk. Notes of barnyard, sourness, leather, grain all combine to create a robust if not somewhat muddled, crazy nose. Light vinegar, even in fresh samples. Flavors of huge funk, dried fruits, sweet toasted malts and looming sourness. Medium acidity. Everything seems muddled together, but it really has a great overall taste. Its definitely a strange one. The finish is musty, fruity and very dry, huge funk and biting tartness lingering. The mouthfeel is lively even though carbonation isnt high, very tannic at times and sour throughout. Very good, very strange. I guess that means its right up my alley.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

4426,"2007-03-10",3.9,"Really attractive to look at; mid-sized head with decent coffee-like density.  Colour is a dullish glowing orange (does that make sense). Lovely nose; pongy and sour early, takes me straight back to Rue Gheude, good intensity. Opens and softens over 15 minutes to reveal much more obvious fruity apricot notes, almost to the extend youd be forgiven for thinking you were infact sniffing a botrytise semillon dessert wine, although theres no denying the sour lambic notes underpinning the impressove bouquet.  Palate destroys any notion this will be a friendly fruity beer - sour, tangy, almost salty, pongy sulphuric notes. Truck loads of lemon and citrus with a touch of acid burn. Surprisingly all this flavour doesnt translate into a long or memorable finish. My bottle was very low fizz, and me thinks a few more bubbles may have carried the sour and citrus flavours better as the beer finished up feeling a touch flabby, as strange as it may seem.

4426,"2007-01-29",4.0,"On tap at Stuffed Sandwich, 2005 Vintage.  Pours the color of golden peach flesh with a thin layer of bubbly white head.  The aroma is a sour bouquet of apricots and spicy lemon notes, dusted with white pepper and accompanied by a young alder woodiness.  Light bodied, tingling carbonation with a hefty puncy of sourness.  Quite sour and not very funky, but pleasantly clean tasting.  The apricots are definitely there, but so are some white grape, granny smith apple skins, and a bite of raw melon rind.  Bone dry.  The sourness hits the tongue hard, assaulting it with a balanced barrage of apricot and woody white vinous notes which linger on the palate through a long finish, finally dissipating to leave a natural unsweetend apricot smack on the tongue.  Very satisfying, and one I wish I could afford to use as an everyday drinker.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

It has been a long time since I have eaten an apricot but I can certainly taste it in the bottle.  The taste is tart and sour and light and tasty.

The taste is a ton of sour that socks you in the face--this coming from a guy who considers this his favorite style--so it is definitely sour.

4426,"2006-05-24",4.2,"Bottled 2005. Well it certainly looks like an apricot beer (not that I can think of any other apricot beers Ive had) - hazy orange with a sparse head. The first thing I noticed about this one was that the aroma didnt make my mouth pucker up before even tasting it like most Cantillons do, which as it turned out was a harbinger of things to come. This was quite unlike most other Cantillons Ive had. Distinct peppery lichen aroma with not much apricot character, though perhaps theres some of the skins and an earthy stem character. The house lambic character does eventually come through, but remains restrained at all times with bits of wood, cobwebs, stale hops and aged cheddar peeking through. Whereas the aroma had only a subtle hint of apricot, the flavour is simply bursting with apricot character in the most delicious way. It tastes like tart, dry, apricot nectar with the acidity of dried apricots. The initial sensation is slightly milky, and perhaps even a touch alkaline, and the finish is very clean with a touch of pungent hop. Lambic character is minimal. It gives the impression that most of the acidity is generated by the fruit, not the lambic, and I like it. A lot. Delicious stuff, the best Cantillon Ive had in quite a while. It really goes to show the benefit of getting into them quickly before all the fruit character disappears.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Sunny and peachy orange like a tropical sunset or a really bad 80s T-shirt, it sported a thin white lacing.

One whiff and Kapow!  The usual Cantillon rainbow of aromas that youre not supposed to like but still do, the hay, the pig pen, old baseball mit and grandmas old photo album are there, but the fruit seems much more present, as if it were served with a twist of orange.
If it were any more acidic than this, it would puncture your stomach.  But the fruit shines beautifully once again, showing oranges, tangerines, peaches and a little passion fruit.  Finish is sharp and dry, but with a very long tongue flipping aftermath.  The drinkability of this elixir was strongly debated amongst the crew, and as usual concensus was not achieved.  I was on the ""yes"" side, because I already dusted off a 750 by myself in Brussels, however I didnt enjoy the bottle I had at Delirium Café as much as this one.  But I agree with the fact that this isnt for everyone.  Im not saying this to pass off as a snob, Im just saying that there isnt enough Pepsid AC, Rolaids or Tums on earth to cure what this Beer would do to anyone with ulsers or acid reflux.

Initially some fruit is noticed as you pop the cork, along with some woody notes, but when it is cool you can notice a lot of sour notes, mixing heavily with a lot of musty aromas as well as lots and lots of sulfur compounds.  Some sulfur dioxide, and a bunch of different thiols I cant pinpoint.  Some of the aromas are very similar to those found in a fermenting lager, or those that come from weihenstephan yeast with respect to the sulfur.  As it warms more and more sour and musty barnyard smells come up along with a hint of fruit- apricot-peach like.  Dear lord this is some sour stuff.  First sip is like tasting a sour warhead- maybe even more sour.  This is really mouthpuckering yet I cant seem to stop tasting it.  Lots of sour notes up front with lactobacillus, then a bit of the fruit in the end.  I expected a lot more fruit in this lambic- but only got a minimal amount.  Obviously this is very dry due to its acidity.  Not sure If I will be able to drink this whole bottle by myself, but it is so unique that Ill give it a try.

It definitely has a sweet connotation, honey-like blended with the horsey fruits (apricot, orange, pink grapefruit). Yep, this is a lambic, very fruity, limey, citric, lactic and funky. Yet, its aggressiveness is rather limited in mouth. Its tart of course, but pretty mellowed out.

Peach-apricot colored beer, with a small, fizzy white head, mostly disipating, with light lacing.  Quite hazy.  Aroma of light blue cheese, old funk, musty gym shoes and just an ever so slight hint of apricot essence.  Flavor is very relaxed, by Cantillon standards.  Sourness to start, but its much less aggressive and dominant than in some of their other beers.  A light amount of real apricot flavor (like biting in to a dried apricot) is well integrated with the tart, base lambic.  Notes of light cheese/bacteria and a bit of sweetness right near the finish.  Ends quite a good deal more sour than it starts, with plenty of yeast funk.  Delightful flavor throughout really showcases the lambic, with some apricot as an afterthought.  Medium body, no wateriness, very low carbonation, but just enough to please the palate and keep it refreshing and light.

Acid overrides most of the palate but there are still remnants of what could best be described as Apricot Sweet-Tart(TM) candy enveloped in a slightly grainy though heavily bready malt.

Sour tartness typical of Cantillon dominates the flavour, with pleasant but overwhelmed fruity highlights. Pithy notes in the finish. Spritzy effervescent body.

Would like more apricot in this, has promise of a fascinating flavor combo but just not that much fruit-wise going on.  Really more gueuze than anything.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"

Touches of unripe fruit and rubber in the nose. Initial cobwebs and dust mixed with sour fruit. This can really clean the teeth. Dry and quenching to say te least in the finish. This is one of the roughest/toughest lambics out there. Small sips every few minutes seem to be the limit. Seems to peel the enamel off the teeth. Quite smooth and effervescent in feel. Long sour acidic finish. Heartburn in bottle. For me the fruit does not come out and the balance is off. I can appreciate the effort. The efforts here are more geared to creating the most sour brews, akin to the american most hoppy.

4426,"2003-08-19",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2010 August 2009 Bottled on date; Sampled July 2010
The beer pours with a hazy, sedimented, mucky color due to the completely crap pour by the waitress.  It is topped by a fizzy, short lived, white head.  The aroma is very tart smelling at first, but yields to notes of apricots, a hint of yeast and then back to tart again.  Musty aromatics are joined by notes of musky barnyard notes as well as some catty, urea like notes.  The nose really has a nice, floral / fruit apricot character to it that makes this vibrantly aromatic.

The flavor is bracingly sour upfront and finishes with a softer apricot like acidity that is joined by lactic acid sourness too.  A floral apricot flavor is definitely here, despite the beer being bone dry.  The body is quite light and refreshing and is definitely a beer meant for consuming in quantity (assuming you can get past the sourness of course).  This is very nice, I would have loved to be able to try an even fresher example
Sampled July 2004, 2001 bottling.
Pours a very hazy orange-gold color.  The head is cream colored and dissapears after a couple of minutes.  The aroma is tart and funky.  It is quite sour with some muted barnyard Brett notes.  As is usual with Cantillon the taste is at first shockingly mouth puckering.  After all of this time I dont even get a sense of the apricots.  A bit of chalkiness is in the middle of this beer, which seems to add a bit of fullness to this otherwise light and refreshing beer.  The sourness is reminiscent of grapefruit and lemons.  Though I really wish there was some apricot flavor here, it is still quite good, though just as a Lambic.
Sampled 2002
A orangish light gold color to this beer, that is more light gold than anything.  Pours with a lively carbonation.  I cant detect any apricot in the aroma, though there is a slight fruitiness, but mostly smell sour.  The taste is of course quite acidic, with general musty character as well.  If I did not know this beer I would have no idea that it was made with apricots.  The lambic beasties have completely obliterated all signs of the apricots.  As a lambic type beer this is quite good, though seems a bit simplistic compared to some of the other offerings.  Tastes more of a citrus type fruit, which comes from the acidity.  I am a bit dissapointed in the apricot character from this beer, but it is still quite good.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4426,"2002-04-27",4.5,"Bottled in 2000. Apricot and oak in the aroma. Very sour taste with oak, apricot, lemon, grapefruit. Absolutely no sweetness left. Long finish with lots of citric sourness. Brilliant beer!! Only misses the intense depth of a well matured geuze.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
4426,"2002-03-17",4.0,"The aroma is amazing, light apricot, oak, fruity. Hazy, golden/yellow/amber colour. Small white frothy head. Very sour (almost too harsh), very oak and tart. Fruity. In the flavors the apricot is gone. Short finish, sour and dry.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
