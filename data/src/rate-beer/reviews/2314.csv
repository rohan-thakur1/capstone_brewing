2314,"2016-10-30",3.8,"13%-os belgian strong ale tölgyfa hordóban érlelve, helyezhetjük képbe magunkat a főzet mibenlétét illetően, ilyen előjelek mentén nyilvánvalóan csak a legjobbra számít az ember. Ha a küllemén múlna, aggodalomra sem lenne semmi okunk a továbbiakban sem, borostyán színe és hófehér ködhabja festői vonalakat rajzolnak. Illata a jól ismert sárga gyümölcsök üde bukéjának fuvallatával indít, enyhe fanyar szellő kíséretében, s egy tartalmas barackpálinkás, gyümölcsmagos hangulat is kiérződik az aromafellegből. Az már korántsem ennyire örömteli, hogy egy kilógó mellékzönge is rendre ott munkálkodik már ebben a fázisban is, egyfajta nyers, ipari, valamiféle kaucsukszármazékot idéző illatjegy, mely talán megmagyarázhatatlan módon csak arra az egyetlen palackra jellemző, amit a kezemben tartok, én sehogyan sem tudtam megbarátkozni vele. Az érlelés karakterisztikája természetesen tetten érhető az italban, a mazsolás, kandiscukros, desszertszerű elemek is éppúgy megjelennek, mint a kissé fanyar élesztős, fás jegyek, majd csípős és szigorú, mégis elegánsan jelen lévő alkoholos köntös, s a nem csak jelzés értékkel bíró aromás komló zárása. Idővel az élénksége is csitul kissé, így válik némileg barátibbá a számomra a szerkezet, s az a gumisba forduló mellékíz is visszavesz kissé a tolakodásból, átadva a helyét azoknak a komponenseknek, amelyeknek valóban a sörben a helyük, így alakítva ki a szimpatikus belga benyomásokat.","HUNGARY","adster"

2314,"2015-11-11",4.1,"2008 vintage. Ive been storing this one for four years and decides Xmas Eve was as good a time as any to finally open it. 

Pours a very cloudy, dark golden amber color with dark orange edges and a two finger white foam head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Streaks of soapy lacing left behind. 

Vinous aroma with a strong barrel presence thats nicely integrated into the elements of the base beer. Strong toasted oak character along with vanilla, rye whiskey and calvados brandy notes. Pretty complex and similar to an oak aged barley wine with hints of leathery malt, toffee, caramel and dark fruits. Some spicy rye and apple lingering underneath the barrel notes as well as hints of plum, raisin and fig. Very nice!

Medium bodied with surprising amount of carbonation considering its age and high ABV. As in the aroma, it feels more like a barrel aged old ale/barley wine. Complex barrel character with combination of virgin oak, whiskey and brandy barrel flavors. Toasted and slightly toothpick-y with dry oak, spicy rye whisky, and apple and brandy notes. Zesty spice compliments the spicy rye notes before being countered by sweet and earthy malts, bready yeast and dark fruit sweetness. Strong barrel presence but it doesnt overpower the base with hints of toffee, caramel apple, fig, plum, currants and dark cherries. Theres a decent amount of alcohol sweetness and some warmth in the finish but the 13% ABV is pretty well masked. Complex and flavorful but definitely a sipper.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

2314,"2015-10-31",5.0,"A événement exceptionnel, bière exceptionnelle  Pour mon 1000 ème rating, je voulais une célébration digne de ce grand moment. Bien sûr, jai déjà dégusté cette bière, je connais sa 
valeur dexception, ce nest donc pas la première, et ce ne sera certainement pas la dernière !!!
Bouteille sérigraphiée classe de 75 cl, avec bouchon de liège qualité diam, et médaille dorée.
Couleur ambre roux, avec un léger voile.

Longueur qui est un Everest de la bière, en passant par les sommets des Andes
Jambes huileuses, fines.
Levure magnifique.
Alcool qui est un pur modèle de ce quune bière peut faire, un cas décole pour les 
amateurs de quadruple. Il ne sagit pas bien sûr dun accompagnement des saveurs,
mais dune direction énergique comme le ferait un super coach, avec un dosage des 
capacités de chacun (ici je te pousse la levure, ici je te pousse le malt, ici je te pousse
le houblon ), et bien sûr de lharmonie de lensemble avec la classe dun chef dorchestre de niveau mondial.
Finale divine.
CONCLUSION : une bière qui est un plus quune révélation, un petit miracle (ou un grand 
miracle, selon votre degré de croyance ). Cette bière ne peut être classée dans un chiffrement
sur 10, et a fortiori sur 5 à laméricaine  , cest un peu comme les cols du tour de France
classés hors catégorie  Donc, puisque nous devons nous frotter avec les 5 de Ratebeer,
nous dirons que cette bière vaut 3 fois un 5, ou pour parler plus simplement un 555 sur 100, 
rejoignant ainsi par exemple la Westmalle triple (ce qui est, nous lavouerons sans problème,
une référence ultime ).","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

2314,"2015-04-26",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2015 Bij het openen van de champagnefles een luide knal van de kurk die tegen het plafond schiet, gelukkig blijft het bier in de fles! Uitgeschonken in origineel craquelé Bush Graal bierglas. Enigszins troebel donkerblond /amberkleurig bier, met lichte crèmekleurige schuimkraag die vrij snel, vrijwel volledig verdwijnt. Zeer aangename aroma's van Belgische gist, witte wijn, houtig iets van keldergeur. In het Nederlands heb je er geen mooie benaming voor maar in het Engels wel: smell of barnyard. De smaak is uiterst complex; zoet, zuur en bitter tegelijk perfect in balans.
Deze Bush Prestige is een massief bier met een uitgebreid en volledig smaakpallet. Complexe tonen van: Belgische gist, brood, dan zoete smaken van karamel, honing en gedroogde abrikozen en rozijnen. Daarna tonen van witte wijn, cognac/brandy waarin duidelijk de houtige tannine tonen van de eiken vaten aanwezig is. De afdronk is medium lang, zacht zoet met verwarmende alcohol toetsen. Het bier wordt steeds donkerder naar mate je meer gistdepot uitschenkt. Nog nooit zo'n complex en complete Belgische strong Ale geproefd, met veel kenmerken van een Barley Wine, zeer uitgebalanceerd bier met een knap verborgen alcoholpercentage van 13%. Werkelijk een van de beste bieren uit België, van Brasserie Dubuisson, waar je wel degelijk de rijping op eiken vaten in terug proeft. Tegenwoordig helaas niet meer geleverd in de exclusieve champagnefles van weleer, maar in een normale 75 cl. bierfles met kurk.

This beer had sour with restraint, balanced in a big way by a barleywine-style sweetness and a lot of nice complexity. The other amazing thing: 13% but felt like 7%! How did they do this?

Aroma is malty, oak, butter and vanilla, dried orange, touch of alcohol. Body is medium, pretty foamy to start with, touch of carbonation, drying. Taste is smooth and malt-forward, semisweet, plasticky oak, fabric plaster smokiness, some acidity, a bit of sharp alcohol in the finish, breathy aftertaste.

Aroma contains malts (caramel, light bread, hay), hops (flowers, pine, citrus fruits), yeast (barnyard) and oak (like whiskey without the high alcohol content), grape, raisin, plum, tawney port, alcohol, pear, pineapple and spices.
Flavor is light acidic, then light acidic and light bitter, followed by light acidic, light bitter and sweey and after that light acidic and sweet, to finish in sweet and bitter, sweet, light bitter and finally bitter.
Body is medium to full with creamy yexture and soft carbonation.

2314,"2014-08-08",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 10, 2015 Continuation of the Bush Millennium of 2000, one of the strongest Belgian beers in its day (especially considering the fact that the alcohol strength is obtained by fermentation only), matured on oak. Yellowish, finely structured, crackling foam, quickly dissipating because of the alcohol; colour a warm orangey amber with equally dispersed, minuscule yeast particles, becoming ever more dark and opaque with adding the deposit and eventually a milky chestnut brown. Powerful and almost intoxicating perfume, orange, pineapple, red apple, cognac, brown rhum, caramel, cloves, cake, buttermilk, honey, marzipan. Sweet honeyish and orangey taste, not cloying, evolving into a delightfully nutty maltiness, delicate woodiness, meaty, buttery, finishing peppery and brandy-like, very warming without becoming astringent, with some flowery hops for balance. Powerful luxury barley wine that obscures many similar products and so far my favorite from this renowned brand. Unforgettable.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2314,"2012-10-19",3.9,"August 7th, 2010 - The Scaldis Prestige is a Belgian beer, but it reminds me of the most pronounced flavors I enjoyed on my brief trip to Paris to stay with an old friend. Murky, brown and orange with a thick, tan head and some clawing gripping, its not necessarily much to look at. But beneath that crummy color are powerful scents and perfumes or orange peel, orange preserves, orange marmalade, and a dryness that could come from a whiff of orange pith. The beginning features the same sharp but refined tastes of orange marmalade, but well tailored to a drinking experience. Around the middle of the taste, the alcohol lashes out before leaning back and revealing a more comfortable mix of honey flavors, a blob of dijon mustard, and that same, distinctive core of orange marmalade. I love this beer for the way it transmogrifies flavors normally associated with a dining table into a drinkable beer without the slightest hint of the work behind it. Its simply a beer inheriting a flavor profile that beer should have always had if brewers hadnt taken so long to get to it.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2314,"2010-07-05",4.1,"750ml Bottle. Pours fairly clear orangeish amber with a loose white head that doesnt last long. Multi-layered nose has notes of orange, peach, cognac, vanilla, caramel and oak. Flavour has lots of fruit upfront with hints of orange, apricot, peach, mango and grapes, as well as the notes of cognac and wood, with the caramel and vanilla notes more subdued. Thick, oily mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a lingering finish that starts sweet and becomes a lot more sour. While being reminiscent of the Bush Ambree this is a very different brew. This is far more complex and powerful as well as being more fruity. Although this is excellent now, I would love to try this with about five more years on it.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","BeerChaser0078"

The smell is of fresh fruits (apples, pears, grapes), yeast, dough, fudge and caramel. Some notes of oak. Some alcohol. A dense and rich smell with some champagne qualities to it.

The flavor has plenty of sweet fresh fruits up front. Apples, pears and grapes. More sweetness is added by gentle notes of caramel. A very subtle floral note. A nicely defined oak character does a great job framing everything. A somewhat phenolic taste of alcohol appears in the finish.

Smooth texture. Good mouthfeel from the foam. Medium body.

I liked this one. Complex and rather balanced. The 13% ABV is well hidden, but is still just a little too prominent in the finish. Considering its rather sweet, I dont think Id like to consume a whole 750 ml bottle of this myself, but Id try it again if I had the opportunity.

Pours a hazy orange colour with a nice white head.

Aroma is a bit oaky, with some dried fruit and spices. Alcohol is noticable, but in a good way. Slight note of whiskey and cognac? I don’t know, but it was something that popped up in my head. Probably because the high ABV, it’s almost like smelling a ""finer"" spirit.

Flavour is oaky, fruity, spicy with notes of sour apples and vanilla. Overall this is pretty, or no, VERY sweet with slightly sour notes. The alcohol is very integreted in the taste - it’s easy to drink though the high ABV. Also here it reminds me a bit of whiskey and cognac. It also reminds me of Orval a little.

Mouthfeel is pretty filling and good. Smooth. Nothing outstanding though.

Drinkability is quite high, or eaven dangerously high. I thought it would be harder to get down, but it was easy to drink despite 13%. You definitely need to be on your guard when drinking this.

The alcohol alongside some spicy and syrupy tones makes the otherwise round nose a bit sharp. Unlike many other barrel-aged beers, the oak really has a mission to complete in this one. The flavour begins medium malty and sugary, followed by a light to medium hoppy and oaky middle that ends with a dry, spicy and light grassy sting. The undertones bring notes of alcohol, sugar, dust, wood, fruity orange peel and apples. The mouthfeel is full, soft, creamy and round but the sharp alcohol notes distract the palate from being truly delightful. Medium but soft carbonated.

Nose managed to be both malty and vinous, with sherry, dark fruits, calvados (apple brandy) and also light chocolate notes. Inviting.

2314,"2008-03-23",4.2,"Thanks to Walt for this beer, which he sent, believe it or not, as a gift.  Poured a mostly-clear amber with a fizzy white head.  Pleasant aroma of floral hops, fruits including apples and grapes, and a bit of alcohol.  Taste is a delicate balance between sweet and dry with notes of spicy cinnamon, apple, pear, white wine, citrusy hops, and alcohol.  Finishes fairly dry, though does not betray its strength.  Body is fairly full and reasonably carbonated.  Could easily replace champagne or serve as a digestif.  Nothing original... just skilled craftsmanship.  Nice.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Malty, woody nose with notes of ripe apricots and pears, dried fruit (raisins, prunes, apricots), caramel and lots of oak shining through. Malty, powerful, fiery taste with dried fruit, caramel, vanilla, honey, apples and oak wood. Fiery alcohol comes through with a friendly punch in a peppery, slightly acidic finish. Almost full body with prickly carbonation. Alcohol gives it a certain sweetness, but it stays within bounds and never gets cloying. Lovely beer, a combination of power and beauty!","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"

Full bodied, alcoholic texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Long duration, light sweetness, heavy acidity, and moderate bitterness.

It leaves no lace, but produces a fizzy sound as it goes down.  The aroma has got the oak and vanilla, with other BSA notes of yeast, spice, peach, white raisins, fresh cut grass, pepper, caramel, and bready malt.  The flavor starts out sweet, brings along some fruit, then a lingering honey, peach, caramel, and alcohol warming.  Hops are faint, noticed only when concentrating.  The yeast flavor balances to dampen some of the sweetness.  The vanilla really starts to show through in a lingering presence.  The oak provides some earthiness to make it even more multidimensional.  I find notes of cardamom reminding me of Indian rice pudding, or Scandinavian winter sweets.  Wow, it is so well rounded as it warms.  This is good.  The palate is quite rich and very carbonated to keep it finishing clean.  Overall, this is expensive, but if you rate it as if cost were no object  this is a damn fine brew.  However, Im not buying it again at the price I paid, and Im sure as hell not going to pour out the sediment - which in hind sight was a good decision as it made the last tulip even more well rounded.

The beer is dry, but has a slight residual sweetness, an oaky woodiness, some light fruit, and refinded alcohol.  It is bubbly in the mouth, but isnt too fizzy and almost has a slightly creamy texture to it.

Scaldis Prestige
Date: 4/29/2007
Event: Rivers Bend Belgian Workshop / Abbey Dubbel Brewout
Location: Kens House
Serving: 750 mL bottle (13% ABV) shared by Lance!  Thank you so much!
Tasting Notes
Aroma: Caramel, a bit of soy sauce, toffee, vinegar.
Appearance: Pours a murky brown color (I got the bottom of the bottle) with a tin foamy head.
Flavor: Caramel and toffee malt, fermented apples, oak, some light butter flavor as well.
Palate: Medium light body with a creamy, smooth, and milky texture.
Overall: A fanstastic beer that is quite rich and complex.  Well worth the $45/bottle, but is probably best reserved for special occasions!

9/10/2008:  Scaldis Prestige has a sweet candi and fruit aroma.  Actually, the aroma reminds me of a highly aged fig blasamic.  It is cloudy with a large, puffy, beige head.  The beer is dry with an obvious high level of alcohol.  It tastes fruity and malty with complexities including caramel, whisky, and and definite nots of wood.  This beer has a medium body and is not fizzy, but more like sticky on the palate.  It is very good overall.

2314,"2007-05-15",4.4,"75 cl bottle thanks to sk8viking!  Poured medium golden with a tall initial cap of chalky white head that settles down to a thin layer after a minute or so (2nd pour gives a more majestic, longer-lasting head)... lively carbonation agitates the significant amount of sediment in the drink.  The aroma was just fabulously complex... sweet oak and vanilla give a first impression, and showcase the barrel treatment nicely... not far behind are layers of vinous notes, ripe banana esters, and brandy... just flowed and blended so beautifuly, with not even a hint of overt alcohol presence.   The flavor was right on par with the nose... toasted oak, vanilla, and sweet bourbon sugars dance first on the tongue, followed closely by darker vinous notes.. warm toasty bourbon and vinous notes resonate through the long, warm finish.  Heavier-bodied and highly-carbonated, with a silky feel on the palate.. certainly warm on the back-end, but came as the result of an almost flawless build.

2314,"2007-04-08",5.0,"Beautiful peach color along with a craggy, blooming head.

Nose, and taste of peaches, persimmons, pepper, coriander, vanilla, oak, and subtle bourbon. Most of all, the flavor reminds me  of Krug Clos du Mesnil 1983, which was one of the finest vintage champagnes ever. This, despite the fact that this beautiful ale was not afforded the Methode Champenoise that Deus, or Malheur Brut underwent.The body is silky, and relatively sprightly for its weight, and the alcohol is elegantly restrained, and serves as a catalyst to heighten the flavor nuances. 

This is a true masterpiece of the brewers art, and is well worth every penny of the $40+ dollars a bottle that it retails for.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"
2314,"2007-04-03",4.4,"Pours a huge bursting froth that takes its own sweet time to reduce to nectars edge. Im not gonna rush it either. A tawny golden color appears after a while. The residual lacing is clumpy, sticky, and  spattered. Aroma, first breath from bottle: chocolate molasis. After poured strong aromatics come into play. The oak is noticable w/ nuances of vanilla, brandy, and an almost Lambic (Cuvee Rene) sourness. Although the aroma is strong, it seems to float w/ feather light ease. Medium nectar weight w/ ample residual effers.  Very bold this brew w/ a defined spicey oak character that captures my undevided  attention.  Malted caramel, honey, molasis, cinnamon, clove, persimmons, ripe peaches and banana, vanilla bean. A nice earthiness settles in for tea then leaves abrutly w/o shutting the door. Theres a balancing acidity that holds it all together. I like how the acidity and the spice mingle together like a couple of beautiful, sensuous women at a party causing a scene just by being there together. The finish is slightly alcoholic yet totally enjoyable w/ a honeycomb flavor that seems to linger the whole day.
If you pour it sideways as to reduce the fothy expansion, you better take small sips. The frothy expansion will happen in your mouth and force the  juice down your throat. Its coming out like a parachute man, one way or the other. A nuttiness comes out after the last pour (w/ yeast) where the brew actually mellows a bit on the acidity side and the spices round out. 
This brew is of an exceptionaly complex nature. I highly recommend this to all connoisseurs.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

Melting caramel, lime touches and orange toffee impact the nose, along with freesia berries, lavender sheets and lemon suds diffusing over crème brulee. Brown sugar bake flavor is hidden with lemony raisins. Crème caramels, buttery rum toffee and nutmeg get thrown over golden raisins that have been basted with brown sugar for hours. Slight, dirty chestnut taste with a touch of gritty, chalky lining. Ginger chews and nutmeg meet some caramel pralines and buttery toffee, but the nutty, dampened cardboard intermission is a bit disgruntling.

I was really not impressed with this beer, served from the brewers they really need to age this stuff before they poor it, tasted way to hot with alcohol.

Absolutely incredible.  Fairly carbonated for being aged so long.

2314,"2006-03-26",3.6,"From Bottle, poured at the 2006 Pizza Port 12 Hour Belgian Beer Party.  Tan, rusty orange colored pour with a thin, white ring of head.  Plenty of yeast churns the drink into a cloudy sandstorm of organic aroma.  Spiced falltime apple cider, orange-spiced tea, and a hint of floral rose petals.  The flavors are as overpowering as the aroma is delicate and fragile.  My tongue is beaten into an irreversible submission by a spicy, tingling bombardment of thyme, sage, rosemary bark, and smoky tobacco.  Very unique and complex, but the oak tones are a bit too roasty and overpowering for my palate.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
2314,"2006-03-24",3.4,"Hazy, rustic orange with a thick, foamy layer tiny, cream-colored bubbles.  A wonderful, solipsistic aroma.  Vanilla, coconut, white grapes, oak, caramel, mango, brown sugar, straw, warm alcohol, apples, oranges, pineapple, dry cereals and some light lemongrass.  The body is quite full, as expected, and the carbonation is active but soft on the tongue.  Once in the mouth, the beer is viscous, sweet and quite obviously barrel aged.  The warm alcohol and intense sweetness is probably a little too much for my taste.  There are many strengths to this beer: the complex malt layers, the deft, crafty yeast elements and the additional depths from the barrel-aging.  However, the barrel may have too much impact, the alcohol is excessive or too warm, and the sweetness becomes cloying at times.  I like it, but Im slightly disappointed.  If only they kept it around 7% and threw in some Brett... Nah, I suppose *some* beers should be fermented without Brett.  Thanks Martin!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
2314,"2006-03-07",3.4,"Sampled March 2006
Pours a lightly hazy, full amber (as in the substance) color.  It is very well carbonated and initially forms a three-finger thick tan colored head that is fairly large bubbled.  The aroma is rich and fruity with notes of concentrated pear, tart sweet apple, and green raisins as well as some straight malty caramel notes.  After a couple sniffs of the aroma the oak begins to become quite noticeable; notes of buttery oak, tannic wood, and even a bit of something that reminds me of musty wood.  As is my tendency, I prefer the up front fruit notes more than the oak, the oak is not too bad here (even adds to the complexity), but it comes to dominate a bit more than I would like.

The taste is sweet, yet not overly so, and has a fruitiness that reminds me of sweet, fragrant, slightly concentrated apples with a touch of tartness.  The carbonation adds a bit of a bite, though it is quite tame considering the heft and full mouthfeel that this beers body has.  The oak is here as well, it is most noticeable towards the end, but is noticeable as a buttery note, with perhaps a hint of vanillin, up front.  The oak becomes woody, tannic and a bit astringent as one moves to the long finish.  The tannic astringency is played up a bit by the alcohol that is found in the finish as well.

Well I have gotten this far (perhaps a quarter of a bottle) and I am already asking myself if I want to finish a bottle of this.  It is certainly not the alcohol that has gotten to me, it is the oak, which isnt even all that overbearing in this beer compared to many oaked beers.  Oak is just such a dominating presence, I really prefer a light touch with it.  Perhaps the beer will become a bit more balanced as it warms up.

As the beer warms up it becomes a bit more creamy, perhaps a touch sweeter as well, and in fact the oak does seem to be a touch muted.  I think that it also helps if you drink this beer very slowly, or to be more exact a long time between sips; this seems to keep the oak notes down.  It is almost as if my palate gets more and more sensitive to the oak notes (especially the harsh astringent notes) as I take subsequent sips of this beer.  Warming this beer is definitely the way to go, it really subdues the oak character and makes this much more drinkable.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2314,"2006-02-27",4.5,"A rather hearty cork extraction. A small amount a foam great the top of the bottle and only sets there waiting to be called. A lightly hazed copper color with a tall head that dissipates slightly but still is has a full finger of tan bubbles above the liquid. Pale malt, light oak, and chardonnay are in the aroma. The scent of this one could easily be 5% as it is 13%. Full dry brew that does show a hint of burn in the back of the throat. Light oak malt just oozes through this one. A mild salty caramel and some raisin and starfruit,as well as some  dark cherries and spice seem to float about. As I reach the end of my rating career. This easily transcends itself into my top fifty. Carefree, yet powerful; graceful, yet bold; what more do we want in a brew.

The beer had all the Belgian character that I expected. I was a little surprised that more of the oak didnt come through in the flavor but still I imagine it was like stepping back into the past as this was made the way Belgian beers were made long ago before stainless steel tanks were around. That was my biggest knock on the beer since I wanted more oak barrel flavor. The beer was a medium brown color with some faint red hues. Aroma was characteristically Belgian. Taste was smooth. We let the bottle warm up but probably not enough because the last few sips we had that had warmed up even more really made the great flavor stand out.

2314,"2005-10-15",4.2,"This golden amber ale poured with  a huge off-white head, eliciting a pleasant caramel/oak aroma with a slight alcohol scent. The flavor is initially malty sweet, but well-balanced with a very clean whiskey/oak finish. There are undertones of toasty yeast and green sapling. Overall, a very nice brew.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
2314,"2005-10-10",4.2,"Poured a hazy amber with tiny floaters and a small off-white head.  Aroma started with the barrel liquor, then alcohol, then some sweet malt.  Even though the first two components of the aroma were of alcohol it was pretty balanced.  Flavor starts again with the ""bourbon"" then sweet malt to give a decent balance.  The alcohol was well hidden for 13%.  The warming was there though.  Crisp carbonation and medium bodied.  Is this woth the $35?  I have to say it is damn close.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"

2314,"2005-09-19",3.9,"Sampled at the Ohio Labor Day gathering, provided by Styles.  Id been waiting to try this one for some time.  Cloudy orange-amber pour, thin, light cream-colored clumping head.  Hot alcohol and vanilla aroma, fruity, with hints of peach and apple, in addition to coconut.  Big oak and vanilla notes opened up the flavor profile, with white grapes and a touch of peach attempting to make some sort of impact on the palate.  The strong vanilla and oaky dryness dominated the palate overall.  Heavily dominated by oak and alcohol, to my dismay, overwhelming the characteristic BSA flavors I expected to find.  That said, I was generous with my numbers, and Ill stick with them.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

OK, so this beer lacks the balance or sophistication of many of the trappists.  So what does it have instead?  Flava Flava Falva.  The oak aging combined with this yeast and malt combo is just golden and glorious.  This is such a full, sweet and potent concoction.  There are as many comparables of a fine scotch as any beer Ive had to date.  A treat.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"

Finish is warming with a nice bourbon presence, but its not overdone.   Mouthfeel is a touch fizzy but manages to come across creamy as well.  Someone mentioned that it had a Southern Comfort quality to it, and I can see that as well.

2314,"2005-09-05",3.7,"Thanks Styles and Pailhead for the bottle, tasted at the Labor Day gathering: Cloudy orange and amber hue with a small head and good lace. The aroma had notes of rye whisky and oak with some coconut, butterscotch, floral and grassy hops. Nicely complex esters indeed! The taste was a let down all things considered. A sharp oaky bite with some acidic fruits and a lot of earthy undertones. It finished vinous with vanilla and rye tones. The feel is fizzy and yet lush, very warming and phenolic. This is quite nice but not a top beer for me. Still I would say that you should try it if given the chance.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

2314,"2005-07-25",3.9,"Has ""woody"" been used yet? While I did thoroughly enjoyed this, it did not quite reach the expected heights anticipated by the name nor did it match the beauty of the bottle. Okay, perhaps it was more spectacular than the bottle, but I hate having my sights set so high even when I know the potential for having it all shattered. Back to the beer - the woodiness mentioned definitely mingled pleasantly with all else - caramel and nuts and perhaps figs with an oxidation present that was not detrimental.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"

Spicy, oily, sickly almost.  Some say port-like, well the alcohol is there for sure, but a port this is not.  More like Pauwel Kvak: sickly sweet, sharp burning alcohol, and for my tastes its far too aggressive and cloying and lacking balance.

An unfiltered, orange and gold colored beer, lightly brassy and coppery with a large white head that dissipates very quickly for a of its age.  Aroma of apple blossoms, dry maple wood, toasted oak vanilla, cask wood, bits of oranges and a smattering of candyish sweetness, but for its youth it seems way too dry in the nose, to me. A touch of alcohol, but nowhere near what one would expect from a 13% abv monster.  Flavor begins quite malty, chewy and sweet, but the alcohol notes, pommeau-like flavors and dry yeast notes, with tons of woodiness quickly come to balance.  Hard candy, some caramel, lots of cask wood and orange marmalade.  Vanilla and yeast on the end, growing stronger and warming as it goes down.  I found, on the end, flavors of what pungent perfume smells like.  Sharp, bordering on harsh and just too much force without gracefulness.  Its funny how this starts out so thick and syrupy-sweet and then finishes with drying perfume and alcohol.  But chalk that up to youth.  Im sure the lopsided palate will meld nicely together with a number of years under its belt.  Medium-full body, peppery carbonation.

Cloudy looks, great white head mocks the 13% ABV though eventually settling down to a film and then a lasting white ring, still some finely shaped bubbles. Strong and rich aroma full on apples and mint and not far in leather and floral aspects. Complex flavour profile, very woody, in a dry, straight sawdust fashion. Huge perfumey character enhanced the weirdness of the dry nature. Cologne, toasted malt, bread. Develops an astringence from the barrel that almost defines it.. I find most wines to be astringent, this one has it also, but in its own way. Very unique beer, extremely dry toward the end yet massively sweet earlier. Pleasant greenish hops seem to emanate in the later sips, how can they get through that strong brandyish character? It almost starts to burn when you keep it long. Still, they come out those hops, leafy, minty accompanying the apricot and marmalade fruitiness toward light vegetal notes. Palate is soft, smooth. Creamy texture after a few seconds, then it becomes dry as sand. Just a comfortable thing to have in your mouth, this was quite an adventure and Id still call the alcohol very well contained.
