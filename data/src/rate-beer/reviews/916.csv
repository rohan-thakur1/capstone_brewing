916,"2016-07-08",3.6,"0,33l bottle at home. For some reason my bottle seems to say BB 01/2016 (according to google translate), havent even had it that long. light gusher but quite strong carbonation, brown / redish hazy color, quite big off white head. smells of resin, a bit glueish, lightly fruity. rather good smell. medium to full body, soft carbonation, slick mouthfeel. tastes of resin, lightly fruity, a bit soapy, hints of caramel, light veggies, lightly earthy, spices. finishes lightly bitter with notes of resin and light dark fruits. quite enjoyable, very light veggie notes (which I assume are there because my bottle isnt the freshest anymore), but overall still great to drink.","Vienna, AUSTRIA","Werckmeister"
916,"2016-07-07",3.3,"33cl bottle, bought at De Bierkoning, Amsterdam and consumed on 07-July-2016. Hazy reddish brown in colour with a really thick beige coloured head. Fizzy pour and lively. Aroma of sweet fruit, molasses and spices. Medium body. Slightly sweet, lightly hopped - fruity and slightly tart. Molasses, cinnamon, caramel malt and an alcohol buzz. Character of a sweet pale ale.","NETHERLANDS","R4N5H"

916,"2016-04-10",3.4,"Collab of no less than seven breweries, including Elysian and Lucky Bastard. Quite strong gusher. Very thick and rocky, pale yellowish beige, irregular, coarse head over a hazy brownish copper coloured beer, notably darker than the average steam beer, as which this is apparently intended. Pleasant aroma of raisins, gingerbread, overripe pear, biscuit, cake dough, soap, brown sugar, cinnamon, apricot, Haagse hopjes, gin, cocoa powder, dry earth, white pepper, banana, apple peel, marmelade, cloves. Medium sweetish onset, estery with hints of raspberry, pear and banana, fluffy mouthfeel with medium to sharpish carbonation, bit minerally, sourish elderberry accent, soft caramelly and nutty malt sweetness with bittering toasted edge while the esters as well as some spicy phenols keep playing around; finishes with a pleasant, earthy and spicy hop bitterness, rooty yeastiness and lingering malt sweetness, but also some badly hidden, slightly astringent alcohol and glueish solvents making it a bit more harsh than it should have been. Still an interesting and enjoyable beer though, perhaps stretching the limits of California common too far and showing even some Belgian traits in spite of the use of steam beer yeast and American hops.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
916,"2016-02-03",3.3,"33cl bottle. Pours dirty hazy deep orange golden colour with a very big beige head. Aroma of spicy malt, bitter hops, red malt. Taste of mild bitter spicy hops, green tea, high carbonation.","P´Castle, GERMANY","Beerhunter111"

916,"2015-12-22",4.8,"Bière de collaboration entre 7 brasseries ( impressionnant...), et donc hormis notre néerlandaise, on trouve 
une espagnole, une allemande, une polonaise, une tchèque, une africaine du sud, et une américaine des States (Elysian). 4 malts (pils, carared, mélanoidin, et abbaye), 4 houblons(Summit, Simcoe, Cascade, Citra), et la recette est la même pour les 7 brasseries, sauf en ce qui concerne la levure employée. Ici, Vandestreek a choisi la levure dune california common ou de la steambeer de chez Anchor. Niveau abv de 6,5 %. Mon exemplaire était juste à date.
Bière très technique donc, et dans ce cadre on doit être très exigeant....
Couleur brun roux châtain foncé.
Grand mélange de matière, dû à une très forte carbonation à louverture (plus de 3 minutes pour évacuer le surplus!!!).
Bulles fines partout, mais pas très nombreuses.
Mousse brun clair épaisse, qui forme un nappage à flocons moyens, stable à 2 mm.
Arômes de fruits exo, fût de vin, pointe de rhum et cuberdon.
1ère bouche soyeuse à la très belle entame fruits exo/fût.
Arrière-bouche très accentuée liqueur, avec une amertume pointue, pointe de citron vert.
2ème au grand fondu des saveurs.
Arrière-bouche sur les fruits exo, et une amertume complexe.
3ème vraiment jolie avec des herbes et épices.
Arrière-bouche qui travaille lamertume, très savante.
Longueur très fine, complexe, et surtout très belle.
Jambes fines, serrées, groupées.
Levure pointue, fine, belle ligne.
Alcool très correct pour le genre, il souligne toutes les qualités du produit, et gère lensemble avec une belle maîtrise.
Finale qui nous surprend encore avec des découvertes.
CONCLUSION : on finit par regretter le visuel de la bière, parce que tout le reste est impeccable.
Cette équipe a concocté une grande recette, et la levure de Vandestreek était bien choisie pour la mettre en valeur. On ne comprend donc pas cette carbonation à tout va, et on la regrette amèrement (sans jeu de mots), parce quelle interdit le top dun cheveu... La barre était placée très haut aussi,
à cause de la technicité ...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

916,"2015-10-19",3.6,"330ml bottle. Slightly cloudy, dark copper-ish, chestnut colour with huge, firm, frothy, fairly lasting, moderately lacing, beige head. Spicy herbal, grassy hoppy, and nuttily malty aroma, hints of gooseberry and plum. Taste is minimally sweet caramel malty, a nuttily wafer touch, slightly dry, fruity hoppy overtones, hints of red berries, plum, slightly bitter fruit parings. Nicely diversified, in the end equalised battle of bitter vs. sweet resp. ascending vs. gravitating combatants.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"

916,"2015-03-25",3.5,"The concept of this beer alone merits attention. Smells like an IPA, but is much more subtle in taste, almost has a dry chalky quality, even some flavors you can find in a schwarz. Very enjoyable.
