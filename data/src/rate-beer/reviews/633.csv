633,"2016-04-25",3.7,"Bottle, 33cl. Pours a beautiful dark brown colour with a marvellous thick pale brown head, prominent and dense; brilliant lacing as expected. Very floral aromas, those you would expect from hoppy IPAs, herbal, not as much malt as I had expected though. An uncommon aroma for any sort of stout/porter-like beer. Dark chocolate and malty flavours, toasted, also hazelnuts, sweet but with an astringent finish, very clever. Resin too, which accounts for a bit of the overly pine-like character. Some might consider this a drawback, others might like intense hops in every beer they drink (I personally prefer more neutral stouts). Very complex and intricate, but that resinous bite is not one I enjoy too much; either way, its spot on in terms of its DEVELOPING taste - set this as an example for a beer that is not one-dimensional. Finish is too hoppy, just like a black IPA. Medium to full body, oily to creamy texture, a beer to devote time to, definitely not a light one. Citrus is very subtle, but can be imagined if thought hard enough.

633,"2013-04-18",4.0,"Such a solid beer. Bottle from Mikkeller and Friends (Came wrapped in beautiful blue tissue paper, cheers). Plenty of almost beige head, bigger bubles than expected. And the nose can also be added to the unexpected column, for a lactose dark beer, it comes at your sniffer with pinecones and buiscuts, an unlikely but welcome mix indeed! Once you take the plunge, it starts to slide down with the more familiar sweetness of a milk stout making way for yet another unexpected patter of fresh american pale ale-esque hops which work terrifically in tandem with the sweetness of the lactose. Once these lovers have made their way off into the night, the beer leaves you in a velvet lounge of afterstastes to savour the dark truffles and machiato on offer well after the party has made its way to your stomach leaving you with only one, very easy question; another?","Copenhagen, DENMARK","pintlyfe"

633,"2013-03-18",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2013 Keg (Pudel Baar, Tallinn)
Sweet nutty cakey aroma, as well as a lovely rich smooth burnt roast. The nuttiness is more like  the slightly burnt flaked almonds, glazed of course, youd get on top of a cake. A little weird in places occasionally. Looks good, basically black, with a tight keggy tan head. Smooth palate, pleasantly crispened by the carbonation. More burnt than the aroma indicated, but not ashy or astringent. Alcohol well in check. Taste mellowed nicely by the residual sweetness. Its not as lactosey sweet as many othe milk stouts Ive had, Im not a bif fan of that. Im guessing the yeast attenuated the available sugars quite fully, so the lactose just filled in the gap left, and it does that well. Finish mostly a burnt roast, and some twiggy bitterness. Just the occasional weirdness stops this from being a ""wow"", but this is very solid. To 0l ROCK!
