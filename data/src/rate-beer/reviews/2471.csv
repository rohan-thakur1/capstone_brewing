Taste: Rich, deep malt sweetness with a well balanced blend of caramel, toast, and bread crust. Lighter dark fruit character than in the aroma, that turns to a bit of spicy cherry from the alcohol. Bitterness just enough to prevent the malt sweetness from being cloying.

Finish: Toasted bread strong on the finish, with a touch of dark fruit.

2471,"2015-12-10",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2016 A really old favorite. In the 1960s, I got drafted and was fortunate enough to spend a year and a half stationed in Bamberg, Franconia, Bavaria, Deutschland. And to learn what real beer was like and enjoy the numerous small Franconian breweries while my friends and brothers were being killed in yet another senseless imperialist war. But anywho, toward the end of the month and the next payday, we GIs were always broke and in need of some mind numbing forgetfulness for pocket change, and I hit on a few bottles of this Eisbock, at one mark a bottle (at that time 25 cents) plus a couple of shots of cognac (similarly priced) as a quick trip to la-la land. Good non-memories of several wasted years serving Uncle Sam. Anyway,
my local astonishingly good pub, The Foundry, invited me to a free holiday event this evening, featuring several brewed for the occasion small casks, and when those ran out, a selection of their bottled stuff, resulting in the appearance of several sixers of the aforementioned Eisbock. What can I say. Same old shitkicker! Here I copy a BA review, as most reviewers of this brew appear to be as inebriated as myself... ""Aroma of sweet, rich malt, dark dried fruit, hints of brown bread. Flavor follows aroma, with rich sweet malt, dark dried fruit, hints of molasses and brown bread. Classic bock flavors, but a little more intense. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A nice, classic eisbock, providing great bock flavors intensified by the ice process, well balanced between fruit and malt flavors. Alcohol is well covered and this can be a sneaky beer since is it slightly sweet and full of flavor, it is hard to sip slowly. Nicely done."" Yeah, down the hatch.

Ive been pondering about this German classic for years and finally found a bottle to rate it. Thick, dense, creamy, pale beige head over a very dark purple brown beer, still translucent though. Very purely malty aroma of dry cookies, caramel candy, damp cloth, brownies, hint of tea, toasted brown bread, dried banana, chestnuts, butterscotch, leather, quite a lot of iron but coming across as quite natural still. Condensed sweet onset, candied dates, dried banana and hints of candied cherry, deep and subtle sourishness balancing this sweetness, soft carbo, very caramelly middle with nutty and chocolatey accents, smooth and lightly oily, fairly thick mouthfeel, fruit sweetness carrying on over this thick caramel sweetness, light bittering in the end, a little bit toasted with soft, structural herbal and earthy hop touch; somewhat liqueurish and gin-like alcohol warmth is there from the middle and heats the throat a bit without becoming astringent - or even without decreasing the surprisingly high drinkability of this beer seen its ABV. Not very complicated but very well crafted, an old European classic which inspired many others and a must for maltheads.

2471,"2015-04-29",4.3,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at ~45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep hickory brown, shaded vaguely with red tones, and forms a thick very pale off-white head with good retention. Lacing is decent.

Smell: Deliciously malty, dark yeasty bread and lightly roasted grains.

Taste: Thick, warm, yeasty dark bread of several different types - rye, pumpernickel, pretzel, pandoro - fills the mouth, suffused with swirls in the loaf of a mixture of caramel and toffee. Towards the finish, a syrupy sweetness comes through beneath the bread, as if there were a toffee tree that could give forth toffee syrup.

Mouthfeel: Full and creamy, though not quite as much as other eisbocks I have had.

2471,"2014-09-14",4.3,"Poured from bottle into a snifter
 Appearance  The beer pours a super deep mahogany color that is bordering on black. Upon pouring there is a small tan colored head that fades over about a two minute time frame to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass and some foam islands on the surface of the brew.
 Smell  The aroma is huge of a dark fruit smell with tons of dark cherry, plum, fig, and grape. Along with these dark fruit and sweet smells are some of sweet smells of molasses. A good showing of roasted malt and toasted grain as well as a very strong booziness being there as well producing a quite dark and robust aroma overall.
 Taste  The taste begins with a thick and sweet dark fruit flavor of cherry, plum, and prune. The sweeter fruit, which create a heavy base flavor for the brew, are also joined by some tastes of caramel and molasses. There is a good showing of a roasted malt flavor upfront which ends up getting slightly stronger as the taste moves to the end. As the taste moves beyond the middle of the profile, a little bit of an herbal and earthy flavor joins the tongue, but these remain relatively light throughout. Some toasted grainy flavors come more toward the end of the taste and are joined by some flavors of cocoa and even more molasses. With a light rummy boozed flavor coming to the tongue at the very end, one is left with a super dark and sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is very thick and chewy with a very light level of carbonation. For the style and the big sweet and dark flavors of the brew the feel is spot on, making for one enjoyable slow sipper.
 Overall  This is a very nice Eisbock with tons of sweetness and a good roastedness. A rather tasty and big sweet brew.","","Darkmagus82"

2471,"2013-12-25",3.9,"Review from notes 7/7/10
Poured from 33cl bottle purchased at Jims Homebrew in Spokane, WA ($4) into Sam Adams glass.

A: Dark ruby brown with thin lace at rim. Central dome of dissipating bubbles.

S: Strong and sweet grain, bread, toast, nut. These all combine and form a graham cracker scent. Nice.

T: Nice. Figs, cherry, deep roasted coffee. Hint of spice, resin. Toasty finish, like a good dessert.

M: Creamy medium body with low carbonation allows beer to flow strait back to throat with ease or to rest on tongue. 

D: Excellent craftsmanship. Enjoyable experience. Nice how the flavor and body changes with amount of time in mouth. Transitions from the initial sweetness to resonate into the more complex nuances of hops and grain.

Appearance: In the glass it looks dark brown with reddish highlights. It is topped by a small tan head that quickly fades to a light ring of foam. Lacing is minimal and very slick.

Smell: The aroma is the star of the show and offers deep inviting layers of malty goodness. I get lots of sweet roasted malt, caramel and dark fruits like plum, figs and raisin with drop of molasses and rum like alcohol.

Taste/Palate: Its flavor matches the aroma to a tee but comes off a little lighter than I had expected yet still full bodied. It brings all the wonderful layers of maltiness with a mellow warming abv. It finishes sweet but not in a heavy or cloying way and the palate is smooth and full yet still very drinkable for such a big beer.

2471,"2013-08-05",3.5,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with one-finger beige head. Head persists quite a bit, leaving a lacy coat around the glass. Initial aroma is jam packed full of fruit; berries, prunes, raisins, you name it. After letting sit for a bit, things turn more towards caramel, though the raisins remain. Taste brings the booze and more sweetness. Caramel and raisins are the prominent flavors. Sugary, though not sticky amazingly enough. The beer is well-carbonated, which lightens the texture of this one considerably. Was not expecting that at all, which for what I want, is not a good thing. Finish is boozy raisins.

2471,"2013-04-12",4.2,"I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a snifter. There was no decipherable freshness date.

Appearance: Pours out a dark brown shade, but appears to be opaque black in the glass with ruby red highlights. Forms a relatively large, eggshell, foamy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Strong alcohol presence, but distinct fruit as well. Similar to a flavored liqueur.

Taste: The eisbock is a style thats hard to come by, but if youre lucky enough to find one youre usually in for a treat. Kulmbacher Eisbock definitely was for me as its comparable to a traditional barleywine as far as flavor goes, but with a thinner, slightly crisp body because its a lager. Dark fruits like red apple, cherry, fig and plum as well as toffee are all quite prominent. The alcohol is as well, but its not distracting and makes the beer drink like the true sipper it should be. 

Its a well balanced palette all around, too. Though definitely on the sweeter, maltier side, Kulmbacher Eisbock is not a sticky, syrupy mess. There is some residual flavor on the tongue, but it is not cloying or drying, but rather just ""there."" The taste is quite delicious, though not what I would consider among the best of the best. Still, youre in for a treat if you drink this beer.

Drinkability: For a strong beer, Kulmbacher Eisbock is no challenge to drink at all. Though the 9.2% ABV potency is noticeable in the nose and in the taste, theres no raw heat or burn in the drinking process. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side for sure, but soft and slightly crisp. Probably best enjoyed as a dessert or special occasion beverage, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The smell is all malty molasses: with a dark alcohol laden fruit cake dropped into the brew. The taste is also sweet malty fruit cake: raisins and Victoria plums soaked in a bitter-sweet balsamic mix with some caramel and burnt butterscotch all add to make this beer more than just a uber strong Bock.

Appearance: Dark dark brown, near black.  Opaque.  1-1.5 fingers of soapy khaki-colored head.  Looks nice in the glass.

Aroma: Lots of malt notes (milk chocolate, biscuit, slight roast) mixed with dark fruits (raisins, figs).  Slight banana, almost Belgian smell.  A touch of booze. 

Taste: Milk/bittersweet chocolate, brown bread, biscuit, very slight roast.  Figs, dates, raisins, and dark berries through the middle and into the finish.  Theres some caramel and toffee present into the finish that works well with the rest of the flavors. Some spiciness (cinnamon) as it warms.

Mouthfeel: Syrupy, thick. The alcohol isnt hidden at all.  Definitely a noticeable warming in the throat.

Overall: This is a delicious beer.  Because this was my first eisbock, I wasnt 100% sure what to expect, so I can only compare it to other styles.  It reminded me of a dubbel with touches of Belgian-ish flavors mixing well with the rest of the palate.

Strong aromas of raisin bread, loads of caramel, fruitcake, perfumey noble hops, and amazingly almost no alcohol or fermentation esters/phenols.

Den sidste i kvartetten af øl nydt før Svartsot-koncerten i Nakskov, i godt selskab med Troels, Brian og Frank. Øllen er brun uden skum, og det var sådan set hvad jeg havde forventet ud fra erfaringer med andre eisbock. Duften var dog ringere end forventet - alt var noget gammelt brød. Smagen lidt bedre, men stadig præget af gammel brød, malt og alkohol. Kun en medium bitter afslutning. Mundfølelsen mellemtyk og blød. Ok.

But its not one-dimensional, it twists and turns, and, despite the loveliness, it has its challenges and secrets. Theres aromas of oil and petrol and decaying matter and bubbling richness, theres alcohol nips, and theres bitter spots, and theres a solid tobacco stained adult quality about this.

Pours a moderate amber-copper color with a pretty good off-white head. A bit of spotty lacing on the way down and a nice, thin collar around the edges of the beer. The nose is pretty sweet with some dark fruits and a touch of oxidation. Not all that much alcohol. The taste is a bit of caramelized malt with some fruit and quite a bit of sweetness. Not much booze comes through in the feel, though that might be because its quite sweet, bordering on cloying. Not a bad beer but half of this bottle was more than enough for me.

2471,"2011-04-13",4.2,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle into a large snifter.

Appearance: In the glass it looks dark brown with reddish highlights. It is topped by a small tan head that quickly fades to a light ring of foam. Lacing is minimal and very slick.

Smell: The aroma is the star of the show and offers deep inviting layers of malty goodness. I get lots of sweet roasted malt, caramel and dark fruits like plum, figs and raisin with drop of molasses and rum like alcohol.

Taste/Palate: Its flavor matches the aroma to a tee but comes off a little lighter than I had expected yet still full bodied. It brings all the wonderful layers of maltiness with a mellow warming abv. It finishes sweet but not in a heavy or cloying way and the palate is smooth and full yet still very drinkable for such a big beer.

Comes in a brown bottle with a flashy ""Ice"" label. Pours a nice tan 1 inch head that appears very bublly and thick, you cannot see thorugh the dense, dark color of this beer.

The smell is overwhelmingly of chocolate, with a juicy(yes) smelling toffee malt to finish. The smell is pretty scrumptious.

Taste is a lot more bitter than expected, and its gooood. Lots of dark roasted malts, coffee like bitterness, and a very faint bit of molasses/chocolate sweetness in the middle. This is a nice robust brew with only little traces of its 9.2% of alcohol which isnt overpowering, but its there and increases as it warms. Its got a really nice and thick mouthfeel with a fair amount of carbonation. It leaves a good amount of stickiness in your mouth and on you lips though you cant taste the sugars as prevalent as you can smell and feel them although it does get slightly sweeter as it warms with the alcohol.

The beer in glass is deep brown, almost black with a surprisingly large head, which, however, does not hold too long. The Eisbock smells intensely chocolaty and roasted malt, almost like a good Imperial Stout. Starts chocolatey nutty, subtle caramel and fruity, just absolute amazing! The aftertaste is also shown chocolatey-roasty, resonates very long and warm. Especially for the winter season a brilliant beer. The center part  is chocolaty, roasted malty with a strong body.

2471,"2010-05-06",4.4,"Bottle.

A - Dark black with some ruby brown hues on the edge. Small frothy and bubbly off-white head. Reduces fast with just tiny patches of lacing left.

S - Somewhere between toasted and roasted dark malt. Fairly sweet with caramel, brown sugar and molasses present on the nose. Some dark fruit (plum and date especially) and just a faint hint of overly ripe banana. Some alcohol also present, making it somewhat like a dessert port or other dark dessert drink. Full, rich aroma with a promise of some sweet, gummy flavors.

T - Similar to the nose. A lot of rich dark malt. A touch of bread flavors but loads of burnt caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate are much more dominant. Also a strong amount of dark fruit (strong plum, date, and raisin presence). All these make a sweet sticky, rich flavor. Some alcohol is present but it isnt very strong and really just provides a nice warming touch that also balances the sweetness a bit. Mid sip there is a touch of earthy hops along with a nutty flavor and some dark chocolate and licorice.  The dark malt and fruit comes out again at the end and lingers on the tongue.

M - Full body with moderate carbonation. Very velvety, silky smooth with the flavors having a sticky/lingering aspect. A very full and rich beer.

D - Very drinkable beer. It is a touch too sweet and too high of an ABV to have another in a night, but I certainly would be tempted. I would definitely would have it another night though. Such a rich and smooth beer with a lot of flavor means this is quite a drinkable beer. Makes a wonderful dessert or night capper.

Notes: Best before 14/09/10. A very nice beer that is pretty sweet but not cloying and has enough flavors to balance it out. The alcohol is present and provides a nice warming, but it is very well masked. Very enjoyable beer that is a great way to finish a night. I highly recommend trying it.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Can feel the alcohol throughout, but stays well hidden and never gets boozy. Sweet with a prune-rum and enough of a hop balance to prevent this from cloying. Lots of brown sugar and molasses with other pitted fruits, licorice, and a light toasted toffee. Finishes dry with some cinnamon and light amount of other spices along with an earthy bitterness. Just a touch of alcohol warmth with a lengthy aftertaste following a full, somewhat syrupy body with just a trickle of carbonation. Overall, a cool beer. Fairly straightforward, but well balanced.

2471,"2009-12-16",3.6,"Decided to buy this beer because of a rather healthy alcohol to cost ratio. Wasnt the best idea, but I am glad I tried this monster of a beer. Anyway, pours with very little head... goes away very soon and leaves no lacing. Pours a rather impenetrable brown colour. Aroma of licorice and beef jerky... seriously. The taste of the beer is overpowering. Extremely sweet. Lots of licorice. Sends tingles through your body with even the smallest sip. Fruity, with the ever so slight amount of hop bitterness. A little bit too much for me. This is the kind of beer that should only be drank when you are ready for it and want exactly the taste it will give you, otherwise I wouldnt really suggest this monster to most.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
2471,"2009-12-11",3.6,"THOUGHTS: I love finding these rare eisbocks, There was nothing too special about this one, but it was very nice. One of the good lagers.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark mahogany with a small, off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was heavy grain, cereal and caramel malts; light hops; toffee, light butterscotch and alcohol. The initial flavor was rather sweet; while the finish was sweet, light to moderately bitter and an average to long duration. There was caramel, grain, malt, malt and more malt, slight hops, toffee, molasses and alcohol. The medium to full body was fairly syrupy and a little oily with fizzy carbonation and a lightly alcoholic, slightly metallic and slightly dry finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
2471,"2009-12-10",3.9,"The aroma Is earthy with rich malt undertones reminiscent of fresh beer being brewed in the kettle. The flavor is on the sweater side which lends itself nicely to the thicker mouth feel of the beer and I also found the beer that the beer has a nice alcohol finish.

It tastes like a bock extract, all candied dates, raisins, brown sugar and syrupy French toast.  Its much more of a straight German malt sweetness than the Aventinus banana bread treacle, though both are pleasant in their own right.  Im probably being generous on appearance.

The hops really shine in the finish saving this beer from being overly sweet.  I wasnt thrilled with the overall package at first but it quickly grew on me before I was even halfway through the beer.  If it isnt to your liking at first I encourage you to stick with it.

The aroma is very sweet; almost like a Barley Wine; sweet candies and tons of rich malts. The flavor was quite interesting; loads of rich and intense malt, a ton of dusty dryness leaving your palate really quickly. Not too hot, just a bit of alcohol warmth.

Aroma is probably the biggest let down of the brew, makes me think of dark dried fruit such as raisins or black currants.  Body is much more sensational, some almond and hazelnut with loads of earth, wood, and some vanilla to boot.  Very sweet, almost cloyingly so but that same sweetness brings a 60 second finish.

The nose is sweet, malty, rum-raisin, caramel, and lightly woody alcohol; it’s smells like liquid candy for adults. Medium-bodied and mildly grainy with a ""warm"", dry, woody and moderately astringent finish. The flavor is a fairly boozy dark caramel malt and raisin. It’s like a dubbel blended with a bock, finishing with a dry Popsicle stick woodiness and a lightly grainy astringency.

Finishes sweet, warm and lingering.

Middle has the taste of overcooked maple syrup- not disheartening, but not appealing either- finish keeps going long after the swallow is history.

Minimal, jagged lines of lacing scar the glass.  The aroma is deeply malty and fruity, with alcohol soaked figs, plums, and raisons showing over sweet, darkly roasted caramel.  Its quite fumy from the alcohol note, with traces of candied sugar coming through as well.  The flavor follows suit, as sweet caramel, nougat, and dark fruits combine for a heavy, malty punch.  A strange, almost vegetal component enters the fold on the finish, which is a bit unsettling.  A medium-full, syrupy body plants that sour vegetable taste at the far rear of the tongue.

Prickly carbonation that stings while adding no creaminess to this slick, somewhat airy beer.  Finally some ""strong beer"" flavors appear in the finish, where all the sweet/bitter flavors reside.  Finishes with a bit of brown sugar, nuts, butterscotch, toast/pumperknickel, grapes.  Bitter at first, fades to nuttiness.

Medium to full bodied with creamy carbonation. The flavor is caramel, toffee, roasted malt. There is a component that reminds of the old Grapette soft drink - arguably Concord grape (presumably available at Walmart!). Fruity and malty. The finish is not excessively sweet, and the gritty roast malt aspect tends to balance the sweetness. Malt balancing malt?

2471,"2007-09-08",4.3,"I grabbed this one just by visually shopping at my new favorite store here in Albuquerque (I have since moved). When the ""beer guy"" at the shop told me it was a lot like Celebrator and that I could even do a side by side tasting, my immediate thought was something along the lines of: ""Brother. You are really putting your reputation on the line here."" It was my first suggestion from him and anyone in the store for that matter. I took his advice though and took a bottle of Celebrrator to do a side by side tasting. The two are virtually twins I feel, with minimal characteristic differences. The Celebrator has a more roasted quality and the Kulmbacher has a sweeter edge...and also 2.5% more on the ABV. Overall I appreciated this one quite a bit and was surprised how similar it was to Celebrator.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

This medium bodied, lightly carbonated brew has a sweet, fruity, caramel rich taste and avoids being too cloying.  I thought the alcohol was quite mild for being over 9%.

The flavor is rich and malty with flavors of prunes, raisins, apricots, and vanilla with a mild roastiness that caps it off.  Unfortunately, the beer suffers from some sort of structural issue that makes it seem incredibly thin and watery and yet, at the same time, too sticky for my tastes as well.  On top of that, the alcohol is strong on the palate and lingers long after the sip is swallowed.  I like the style and overall, this is a pretty good one.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

Alright. Whew. A great, seemingly endless depth of rich maltiness with intense flavors of caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, and dark fruits. Theres a slight nuttiness present, as is an ever so faint hop bitterness. The finish is a bit of a contradiction, as the acute flavors stay on the tongue for several minutes at a time.

Ripe dates, sweet, slight alcohol, faint caramel, molasses, and a sort of mustiness. The flavor isnt quit as upfront as the aroma. Taste mostly molasses and mellow aged raisins and dates. Also has that mustiness to it. The alcohol is well done. The palate is very nice, thick, smooth, and full. The finish is very warming and satisfying. The more you drink this beer the more pleasent it is. The alcohol settles in your stomach and leaves you with this internal warming sensation. Reminds me of old, not like old food or old people.

<P>The flavor, like the aroma, is quite sweet. Licorice and roasted nut notes. Some alcohol taste. Tastes somewhat like a barley wine. The roastedness is too subtle and the sweetness is too dominant for my tastes. Reminiscent of a malt liquor, but not nearly as gross as most examples of that style.

<P>Kulmbacher Eisbock is an interesting beer, but I dont think that the icing process really tends to improve bocks. Rather, it tends to make them more extreme and thus less well balanced.

Buttery, toffeeish, brown-bread notes dominate the nose. Cloying, sticky-sweet attakc; thick body, low (but perceptible) carb, and bold flavors. Lots of malt sugar all over the place. Tastes almost like a stuck mash, theres so much unfermented, but of course we know better. This is just a grain surplus turned into a refreshing party beverage. The mid-palate carries that explosion of meadow flavor across into a sticky, metallic finish. My brain certainly wants to understand how amazing this beer is and how highly regarded its been for so long, but this doesnt satisfy as refreshment or as a contemplative beer to sit and sip.

I loved the flavor of this one, and will soon pick up a few more to enjoy and rate properly.    ..  ..  rerate  8/24/2007 ..  .. .. Finally, almost two years later I find another bottle to try.   Its even worth the wait..  a delicious and kickass brew.  Fruity malty aroma.  Flavor is sweet but not cloying, then develops a subtle malt liquor character, and then dark fruit flavors explode on the tongue, and fade to a spicy, hoppy bitterness.  Alcohol warmth is noticeable in the back of the throat.  A delicious treat..  I loved it.","Orange Park, Florida, USA","yayforbeer"
2471,"2006-12-08",4.8,"One of my absolute favorites and one of the very few things that makes me look forward to the colder months (I enjoy Franziskaner Hefeweiss during warmer times) ! My first taste of Eisbock was via an accomplished Pennsylvanian homebrewer. Id never tasted anything like it before and it was years before I found a retailer that didnt look at me like I had three heads when I inquired about this style. If you enjoy this I also recommend Kasteel Bruin (Donkel?) and Samichlaus.  Other similar style recommendations welcome!","USA","MaxGenus"
2471,"2006-12-01",4.0,"The 11.2 ounce bottle poured a clear beautiful deep garnet colored beverage with a thin fizzy off-white head that was completely diminishing and left no lacing on the glass. Typically high alcohol equals no head and this one is a whopping 9.2% by volume. The aroma was a complex sweet fruity mixture of caramel malts and dried dark fruits such as plums and raisins and dates. There was also a background note of aged leather and oak. The body was quite full with a soft carbonation and a thick, smooth texture. The flavor started out quite sweet and stayed that was. The flavor profiles followed the aromas closely. The finish was long and there was decided warmth that developed. This is a great winter warmer.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"

2471,"2006-11-10",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2006 Pours a very clear, but dark, amber with a tan head that dissipates quickly. The smell contains lots of malts, some roasted notes (toasted bread), some fruit (prunes), and some alcohol. The flavor is very malty and delightfully bittersweet from the hops. It starts off with a well balanced interplay of thick and doughy malts with floral and peppery hops. The carbonation provides some zip on the middle of the tongue along with a touch of alcohol bite. The finish is malty sweet with a nice dose of bitter hops and is surprisingly dry with a dry, complex after-taste. The mouthfeel is not as thick as its strength might suggest (the magic of ""eis""bock). It is full-bodied, but not nearly so as other strong bocks. The finish is full-bodied, too - it isnt a very dry beer, but than one might expect from a strong lager. Quite nice.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

The beer pours a beautiful deep brown with ruby highlights and a light tan head; it looks so nice that Ill give it a 5 on appearance and pretend I never saw the bottle. The aroma is plums and dried fruit and molassas, some alchohol, vinous notes. The flavor is moderately sweet and decidedly rich - again molassas and dark fruit, hints of roast chocolate.

Gotta drink this fucker quick.

Very dark red. Big brown head fades away, leaving traces of brown and white along the rim of the top of the beer with little clouds on the inside. Good lacing. 

Smells quite Belgiany, actually, like a Belgian dark pale ale. I was thinking it would be more like alcohol and bock malt, for some reason. Anyways, you got big, very ripe fruit, exceptionally sweet plums and soft peaches, backed up with a nice alcohol twang. 

Ahh, the bock malt is much more present in the flavor. Big fruit upfront--this has aged a bit but is not stale--plums, cherries, raisins, moving into a sweet, chocolately bock malt, and ending on more, very sweet fruit. A hint of alcohol lingers behind. 

Quite drinkable, in spite of its complexity and pop. I have no idea how old it is, thanks to my total idiocy, but Im willing to bet that age has treated this well. The fruit complexities are great, and the alcohol is not at all overwhelming.","Waterloo, Iowa, USA","mynie"

Plums, cherries, alcoholic bliss all wafted up to me. A bit of caramel and chocolate lay down underneath the other aromas with some granola. Wow, this is sweet. Chocolate, plums, and cherries all combine for a chewy beverage. The alcohol is there but does not dominate, it works with what little hop presence in this to keep this from getting too cloying. Marshmallow granola flavor in the finish with sorghum molasses.  A fantastic experience.

The flavour is what one would expect after experiencing the aroma: sweet cereal grains, pumpernickel like a barleywine but with more malt character, probably owing to the lagerness of this beer.  No alcohol flavour, notes of german hops, and some dark malt.  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation and not overly sweet.  Probably the best value ever.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"
2471,"2005-11-13",4.1,"A bit darker than blood red, the head who was quite full at first but died off into a solid ring of lace was a very neutral grey, the kind they use for cubicles.  It made a weird contrast but one that I liked.
Rich with plenty of alcohol vapors, prune juice, raisins, plums and dark chocolate, it was like a nice porto.
Low carbonation, it comes down silky smooth down your gullet, but the alcohol seems to just pop about half-way through your oesophagus and gives you a nice, warm feeling.  Flavors of figs dipped in blackstrap molasses, I was able to detect a slight hoppy aftertaste, but the dark fruits and neutral hard liquor were predominant in the final.  A great sipping Beer, perfect for winter!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

Notes of maple syrup, brown sugar, and buttered toast. Also, sweet raisins, currants, dried apricots, fruit cake, toffee, and a little creamed coffee. Rather warming, but alcohol isnt biting. Healthy amount of hops (with a decent bitterness) round things out; although, sweetness does weigh in heavy in the beer. Overall, pretty decent stuff; curiously reminiscent of many other beers.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

For aroma, theres a metallic twang (probably from the high ABV), which seems to cover up hints of roasted and caramel malts, and a tad of cedar that comes through.  Taste is very rich, characterized by chocolate malts and a small backend of earthiness, walnuts and protruding prunes.  Caramel malts play a dominant role in sweetening and balancing the beer.  Very full-bodied.  Quite possibly the richest beer in the bock genre that Ive had the blessing of tasting.  As it warms, the beer gets only better, smoother and more balanced.

Flavor is of prunes and figs.  I think the alcohol content is well balanced by the other flavors, and actually adds to this brews character.  It doesnt seem to have a lot of the complex character of a good dopplebock, maybe as a result of the freeze distilling.  A good brew nonetheless!

2471,"2004-07-17",4.5,"2/7/04.  Poured out of 33 cL bottle, bought at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel, CA a long-ass time ago.  1996 Vintage.  Holy shit, yo.  Extremely dark brown-red color, capped with a very slight, tan head of large bubbles.  The head can be forgiven, especially because the beer does something Ive never seen before-- it leaves very little lacing at first (maybe because of the temperature?), then begins to leave the most elegant glitter and sparkle, like a thin, light tan metallic foil.  Aroma is lovely-- some grape (like the fruit and also like the artificial fruit flavoring of grape candy), cola, and faint chocolate.  Very delicious nose, sweet and luscious, a bit fruity.  Flavor is just killer.  Caramel malt and bright alcohol, worty.  Syrupy with grape flavors, but not very vinous.  Dried fruit-- prune and plum.  Definite alcohol but not off-putting to me.  Also some chocolate.  Body is medium-full, velvety smooth beneath but pretty sharply biting and sort of humming with a carbonation feel that I somehow dont see.  I would guess its from the alcohol,  but I actually prefer to think that its coming from the gentle pur of pixie dust sprinkled on this magic fruit.  Finish is a lot of dried fruit and caramel malt, now resinous and always resonant, quite long and unique.  Excellent stuff.  Sticky on the lips.  I can tell this bottle is a bit oxidized, but it could still age a bit I think.  Its certainly mellowed some over the years, but its still damn awesome.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

2471,"2004-05-22",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Deep Munich malts develop raisins and cherry jam before encountering caramel and delicate alcohol warmth in this elegant Eisbock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the darkest mahogany.
-Mouthfeel is luxurious while never being heavy.
-The finish isnt too sweet, and even adds a touch of toast and roast.
-Hops are an afterthought flavor-wise, but Im sure there are tons in here to make the flavor profile appear so smooth and not cloying.
-This is obviously based on a Doppelbock or Dunkler Bock recipe. Would love to try either, frankly.
-This methodically tasty eisbock periodically recalls great English barley wines such as J.W. Lees Harvest...

The alcohol is well hidden; this could be dangerous. The only other Eisbock I have rated is the Schneider Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock, which I sampled at the Weisses Brauhaus in Munich.

The taste is clean, smooth and as complex as the ecological and autecological interactions of our once prevelent now depauperate midwestern ecoregions. In spite of the high alcohol content there is not a trace of acridity or offense. Rather, raisins, berries and yeasty earth tones coalesce in this heavenly beverage of the gods.

Sweet malty aroma, caramelly, and raisiny. Big time sweet malt flavor, almost cloying but not, raisins and caramel again, also some licorice. Big fat chewy body, some alcohol warming, but overall well hidden. A delicious treat for a cold day such as this.","Sanborn, New York, USA","IPFreely"
2471,"2004-01-11",4.2,"Available now at Belmont Party Supply in Dayton. Superb eisbock; malty (soooo toffeeish!), very fresh, quite sweet and almost too much so, alcohol is 9.2% - you'd never know. Besides Southampton's Double Eis (which is much much paler in color and even more vanillaey and caramelly) I cannot imagine a better eisbock. So much smoother than Aventinus.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

2471,"2004-01-04",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2004 9.2 abv and best before 12/02/2003.  Ultra muddy dark brown-violet tinged.  Some burnt red on the edges. Small off-white butter head.  Big prunes, alcohol and rich choco-caramel malt aroma.  Flavor is amazing right away.  Big, bold, hearty, some subtle roast, lots of dark fruit, dry caramel, sweet chocolate, prunes.  Full body and a grainy and big even texture.  Low carbonation.  My only complaint was the finish which was very muddled with alcohol, creating a not so nice flavor and slightly metallic.  It wasnt a HUGE problem though.  The majority of this beer was outstanding.  Rerate. Same best before date bottle. I noticed a bit more thinning and unpleasant dryness than the first bottle I tried.  Still quite good. My friend liked it better than Kuhnhenns Raspberry Eisbock, but I cant agree.  Though Kuhnhenns may have too much sweet raspberry, this has too much muddled alcohol apparency.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Really, a splendid nose to be sure.  The body is nice and full, without being too thick or sticky.  Very pleasant.  Both toasty and sweet with all that malt.  A bunch of raisin, caramel, toffee, fig and a variety of other fruits.  Incredibly drinkable with no alcohol present, despite the strong abv.  Just a smooth, tasty beer with a ton of flavor and well-crafted enough to hide alcohol and provide smooth, pleasant tastes.  Find this beer if you can.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Hell...O... there, wow, what a smell! Yummy, thick, rich, lush dark fruit heaven of a nose! Load of malty sweetness, nice dark caramel and toffee with all sorts of little dark fruitened things in there with prune and dates mostly with some fig and raisin hints. Smokey molasses and banana too. What a fantastic nose!! Yum, yum, yum! This stuff rocks!! It takes over where the smell leaves off with the wanting of more! Huge amounts of malty richness, thick and chewy, not overbearingly so, but plentiful in its presense with great dark caramel mixing with toffee. The dark fruits are unimaginably yummy! Plum, prune, fig, and raisin, touches of banana tangyness; then there's some molasses spicyness with some nice little tid bits of smokened earth, brown sugar, chocolate, and black cherry. The sweetness is so rich and deeply dark its wonderful! Has a thinnish start and a bit thin in the finish and is over a little to quick, but overall this sucker is full and thick with a incredibly creamyness and nice chewyness, some stickyness with great lingering malty chewy sweetness leaving notes of dark toffee and tangy dark fruits on the palate. Just a nudge of alcoholic warmth but barely noticeable. One awesome brew thats super yummy, creamy smooth and full of flavor! Strongly Recommended. Easily one of the best beers ever, so unique and very yummy!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Started drinking it too cold, surprisingly weak initial aroma, improves as the beer warms up - malty, but not very complex. Flavour is malty sweet with burnt notes - not nearly as cloying as EKU 28 (thank God!) but also less complex. Alcohol is well hidden. OKish mellow aftertaste. Good beer, but it doesn't exactly take my breath away.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

Large bubbles form a large head that diminishes rather quickly, leaving a nearly still surface with only a little island of fizz in the middle. Nose is powerful, readily apparent from two feet away. Up close, I smell loads of malt with notes of raisin, molasses, white sugar, and alcohol. Thick and slick on the tongue with a spark of carbonation on the back of the throat. Definitely, the sweetness of this beer is most striking initially but it's punctuated delicately with notes of dry fruit and cloves, alcohol warmth, and a pleasing bitter edge in the finish. Absolutely wonderful. A life affirming experience.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Heavy sweet malts with undertones of brown sugar and actually a touch of hops. Rich, yet somewhat bubbly in feel. Fruit cake with a touch of dark chocolate, warmed and soaked in a rick dark rum. Warming and lingering finish with malt and bitter nut flavor. As a side note my bottle lists an ABV of 9.2% - quite near the one of yore.

Dark brown colour, still with good carbonation.  Beautiful dark malt aroma - so well defined it's like chewing on Munich malt.  Sweet, thick body.  Sweet malt flavours mixed with nuts, brown bread crust.  This beer was cloying when fresh, but it's perfectly fine now.  Long, tasty finish.

Cask like feel with the light carbonation. So smooth and delicate with nary a hint of alcohol. The yeast pile is scaring my wife, but is calling out to me like a siren sitting on a rock pile awaiting a ship full of unsuspecting victims. Thins a bit, with whiskey like accents, as it climaxes.
