2767,"2013-03-11",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Fresh herbal Saaz spices up light toasted, bready caramel malts in this cushion-y Polotmavy.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam stays atop the cloudy russet, lacing nicely.
-The cushy mouthfeel makes you expect sweetness, but the finish isnt that sweet.
-The herbal hop aftertaste provides perfect balance.
-Malt flavors are lovely and long.
-The flavor profile is as polished as can be.
