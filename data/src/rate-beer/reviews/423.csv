423,"2016-08-13",3.7,"(Cloudwater Bretted Cream Ale) Tap at In De Wildeman, day three of Carnivale Brettanomyces. 150 ml glass.
Orange coloured body, slightly hazy, with a tall and thick white head on top, very good retention.
Aroma of citrus, orange and tangerine and a hint of funkiness.
Taste follows, citrus, orange, some tropical fruits now, grass, tangerine, again only a touch of funky character at first, becomes stonger on the finish though.
Medium thin body, good carbonation, quite dry on the palate.
Pretty good.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"
