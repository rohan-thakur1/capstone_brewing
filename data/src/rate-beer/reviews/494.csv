494,"2016-02-14",4.0,"Big-tasting, full-bodied stout has just the slightest edge of hops to tamp down the major malts at work. Enjoyed on tap along side a Brie Burger at Ale Asylums Milwaukee Riverhouse -- great combination.",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"
494,"2016-02-11",3.6,"This is a pretty damn decent American stout--and not too sweet even though it mentions sweet malt on the label. Its dark w/ a thin head of fine bubbles. Its got a big roasty nose w/ maybe a bit of a savory hop undertone. This is big and creamy on the palate and just shy of being too much. Theres an interesting anise note and some cherry like fruitiness but also a slight but unfortunate ashy taste. This is pretty solid all around and drinks a lot bigger than its gravity would indicate. Fans of big stouts should definitely check this out.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

494,"2015-09-11",3.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Great Taste of the Midwest on August 08. At this point, Im not going to lie, we were just trying to drink until they threw us out. The pour is a dark brown, near black, with a thick, lighter tan head and a couple pieces of lace. The aroma is full of roasted malt and chocolate with a bit of oat and some hints of coffee. I wish it were a little more aromatic, but its late, and I might be drunk. The flavors are a little better. The chocolate is a little bitter, the roasted malts work well, and there is even a little caramel on the back end. Im also getting some molasses mixed in there. The mouth feel is decently thick with a soft carbonation, but it does fall off of the tongue pretty quick. The aftertaste is lingeringly roasty with a little sweet molasses. Not bad.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

The taste very mild, with only the slightest notes of roasted malts and chocolate. Tasted more like nothing than anything. Very watery body makes this one very drinkable without being overly good. If it was cheaper and more readily available, it could be a good get drunk and party stout. Sad to say it, but i was very dissapointed.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
494,"2008-10-23",3.5,"(Draught)  Pours a black body with a small tan head.  Aroma of chocolate, light roastiness, and nuts.  Flavor of roasted malt, coffee, caramel, and chocolate with a creamy mouthfeel and a moderately bitter finish.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
494,"2008-08-26",3.9,"GTMW 2008: Nearly opaque with a slight creamy head and some oily legs. The aroma has notes of espresso, plum and blueberry esters, oatmeal and heavy toasted malts, and a earthy yeast nose. The taste is sweet malt supported by some dark fruit and a finish that is smooth coffee. A touch of Creme Brule as well. The mouth feel is sticky and medium to full-bodied. A very nice stout.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
494,"2008-08-10",3.7,"2008 GTMW. Aroma of oats, coffee and roasted malts. Taste is much of the same and the oat silkiness is definitely noticed on the tongue. A pretty solid stout.","highland, Indiana, USA","inkubus27"

494,"2008-05-15",3.8,"Near black with a frothy, lightly diminished tan head. Roasted malt aromas with a backdrop of mild green hops, or perhaps green coffee. HInts of caramel and pale malts, and oats as well. Big thick rich feel. This is a stout feel for me. not sticky and lip smacking, but lush and lightly oily, with just a few tiny bubbles to keep it active in the mouth. Just looked at the ABV, much stronger than I expected. I was thinking session, but this would be a dangerous sit-down quaff. Light roasted flavors, with a little malt, a little coffee, and a touch of chocolate. Hints of licorice in the finish and linger. Dangerously drinkable.  A touch more depth in flavor and this would be killer.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
494,"2008-03-17",3.2,"Well, it is big, slick, and a stout.  Full on coffee with light cocoa and a smack of ham.  The sweet meat taste is odd, and is the sweetness gets a little cloying with the thickness.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","Gurst"

Sweet, sticky rich chocolate and toasted grain flavor, with soem coffee and toffee notes, mildly sweet.  Very good, you sense that instantly, but theres something homebrewish about it.  Some plum fruit flavor, some black cherries as well, the kind of fruit notes you find in imperial stout, but here in something more medium strength.

Opaque jet, not a sliver of light (even sunlight) coming through, small lasting creamy dark head....bitter/sweet chocolate and caramel compete with tannic dark vinous notes in the intense nose....body is just a bit too sweet, not quite one-dimensional but definitely a bit unbalanced, ""slick"" all right veering to syrupy....nice vanilla-chocolate nougat flavors though, and a bit of roastiness and faint woody hops do show up towards the finish.  Overall well done but needs a bit more roast and depth I think.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

This was the last of the dark beers as we brought a close to the night.  As   it was one of the better beers, it made a nice nightcap before we ruined our   palates on hoppy beers.  Read on to find out why.

Aroma / Appearance  - A thin creamy head sat on top of a pitch black   body.  Hints of charcol, raspberries, coffee, roasted grains and oats all   wafted out of the tulip glass into my nose, convincing me that this was not   your ordinary brewpub stout.

Flavor / Palate  - The first impression is of a bitter expresso infused   with oatmeal and dark chocolate.  It fills the entire mouth with its wonderful   balanced taste.  Soon I also picked up some ripe black cherry textures in the   creamy mouthfeel.  It took seemingly forever for the flavors to subside from   the back of my throat; it was as if they had gotten stuck there and refused   to move on.  This was an excellently done oatmeal stout and well worth trying   if you like oatmeal infused sweet stouts.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
494,"2006-06-02",3.7,"Full aroma, loaded with dark chocolate and oats.  Nice and strong and I like it.  Dark, dark black with a light brown head that lasts.  Sweet, flavors of nutty roasted coffee, chocolate oatmeal cereal and cola.  Not much roastiness at first but it grows on you with a complex, chalky and roasty finish after time.  Medium-full body, but not super thick. Very creamy.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
