In long: Nose is moderately smoky with a little freshly backed cake.  Taste is very mildly smoked.  Body has a grainy and floury texture.  Biscuit malts and light chocolate.  Overall impression of chocolate chips cookies (the ones without much chocolate).  Finish has a nice bitterness that combines black chocolate bitterness and citric hops bitterness.

Cask conditioning emphasizes the already smooth mouthfeel. Yet another unique brew from these guys.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","BitchesBrew"
3097,"2007-02-01",3.8,"Draught pint at DdC on 1/26/07Large, chalk-grey-beige head is flecked with tan and sits easily atop a dark, milk-chocolate brown body that is nearly opaque.  Head retention is quite strong and recedes slowly to cover with a fair amount of lacing.Clean smoke in the nose combines with a lightly bitter, reserved chocolate note and some aromatic roasted notes.  The smoke is not sour, punchy or horribly thick and salty, but softer, more clean and elegant.  It matches the dark malts and softly sweet base malts very well and allows for a more readily sniffable (and drinkable) experience.  Clean, fresh yeast and light touches of roasted vinousness give a slight pungency to the finish, while light tobacco and vanilla notes add excellent complexity.  Medium-high strength of aroma with, of course, no flaws or alcohol apparency.  Love the balance of chocolate, roast and smoke.Immediately noticeable is the smooth, wet, and somewhat oily texture with medium-low, yet engaging, carbonation.  Before the flavors even emerge, its already strongly drinkable.  Chocolate is light, somewhat creamy and moderately sweet in concert with the base malts and light caramel.  Smoke is layed, tastefully, over everything, with a dry char that evolves in to a bit of saltiness and woodsmoke.  Bit of meatiness, but its passing.  Roasted bitterness sits on the end in fine balance to the sweetness up front.  Light dark fruits and vanilla deepen the experience and before you know it, the pint has vanished.  Outstanding and understated for a smoked porter.  These guys are masters of balance and reservation!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
