1211,"2017-01-11",4.7,"Dopplebocks in general are billed as liquid bread for German monks, but what I want to know, who are these Bavarian monks who sit around sipping beer like this in place of bread? On a quest to answer this question, I drove an hour from my home on the U.S. side of the Quebec border to Brossard in order to locate this brewery, which I did, in a non-descript industrial park. Once inside, I did not find any beer-drinking monks, although did find a friendly staffer who was happy to sell me a bunch of 750-ml corked and caged bottles to bring back home for my own early-winter beer tasting. Tonights sampling is their dopplebock, which is exquisite; I actually prefer this to any of the dopplebocks from Germany that Ive had. 

It pours a translucent deep amber-caramel color  which is gorgeous when held up to the light  with a small foamy head, but rapidly settles with no lacing.

The aroma is intriguing. Theres no one scent that stands out, but with multiple whiffs I detect all of the following, in no particular order: cherries, dates, figs, raisins, molasses, caramelized sugar, nuts (almond and hazelnut), candied blood orange, and fresh-baked anadama bread.

The flavor is all of the above, along with vanilla, chocolate, brandy, rum, and pipe tobacco. It is sweet, yet not cloyingly so, balanced by the subdued boozy warmness that follows. 

It is a full-bodied beer with a soft, silky mouthfeel. 

This is a monk-worthy meal in a bottle.","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"

Arômes de pain grillé et grain rôti avec tout de même beaucoup de sucres foncés (mélasse, caramel, cassonade). Aussi, quelques effluves fumés et terreux, feuille morte, se dégagent également du liquide, ainsi que des pointes de fruits foncés (raisin, prune/pruneau) et dépices (clou de girofle, muscade, piment de la Jamaïque). Lalcool est également subtilement présent au nez, ainsi quune dose assez évidente desters de fermentation (beaucoup de banane très mûre, tendance gomme balloune, limite excessif, solvant), et une certaine acidité vinaigrée un peu étrange. Nez tout de même bien agréable, très complexe, intensité plutôt moyenne cependant. En bouche, pétillement assez élevé sur la langue, onctuosité intéressante au palais, cest moelleux, velouté et liquoreux. Au goût, on note dabord que cest significativement moins sucré que ce que le nez laissait présager, malt bien céréalier de pain grillé et grain rôti, avec saveurs de caramel, mélasse, chocolat brun et cassonade. Saveurs terreuses, tourbe, feuille morte, herbes semi-séchées, légère fumée, légère épices, fruits foncés bien sucrés voire confits (pruneaux surtout). Aussi, goût évident dalcool mais cest agréable et bien intégré aux autres saveurs, et esters et notes vinaigrées bien plus subtils quau nez (heureusement!). Saveurs houblonnées assez difficile à cerner (on est probablement dans la terre, lherbe et les épices), et finale à lamertume plutôt faible. Excellente intégration des différentes saveurs entre elles, bière très complexe, intensité en bouche supérieure par rapport au nez. Très bonne bière! /// Le brasseur mentionne un potentiel de vieillissement de 3 à 5 ans pour cette bière. Jai laissé vieillir une bouteille 3 ans en cellier et le résultat fut fort intéressant. Breuvage moins effervescent et pétillant, mais plus épais, onctueux, presque sirupeux. Explosion des flaveurs maltées, en particulier la compote de prune et lanis, la bière semble bien plus sucrée, moins céréalière, herbacée, épicée et alcoolisée.

A really, really good brew.  Its good when cold, improves when it warms up a bit, but personally I would avoid letting it warm too much as the presence of alcohol will reveal itself a little too much and will prevail on other aromas.

1211,"2010-06-30",4.0,"The pour is a rusty, dark ruby color with a moderately full, fluffy, pillowy, tan head which is mostly diminishing and leaves minimal lace.  The nose is interesting for the style with a definite rauch-type smoke note, some beechwood, candied raisins, dark toffee, some molasses, and some cake-like notes with spicing to match.  The flavor is similar with the rausch and beechwood notes still prominent but never dominant, candied raisins and dates, and some lighter notes of chocolate, toffee, and faint coffee roast.  The palate is nearly full, nearly lively, slightly warm, and velvety but a bit dry.  The finish is a bit dry considering the flavor notes, some light toffee still, more roast (almost earthy), some beechwood, and still some cake.  This was one of the better doppels Ive tried in a while. The multifaceted complexities were unique to the style and the smoke and wood notes were complementary to the malt richness.  The darker roast tones came later in the flavor progression and added a bit of bitterness to the beer, which was nice.

This beer has a thick almost viscous feel to it, and is filling.  Truly a meal in a glass.  Overall this is a nice beer for a beer drinker with a sweet tooth.

Im finally getting that done today. This was very good, if a little sweet. It all came together as it warmed. Very nice in the end. It was nice with Lindor chocolate truffles.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark, amber, brown that was nearly black in the glass, but red when backlit. It had a large, foamy, off-white head that mostly diminished and left excellent lacing. The aroma was moderate chocolate and chocolate syrup; ever so slight coffee; light spicy yeast; raisin, prune, cherry, port and alcohol. The initial flavor was rather sweet and somewhat acidic; while the finish was heavily sweet. There was cherry, raisin, alcoho, chocolate syrup, slight coffee, other dark fruit, lots of caramel, a little roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, a little yeast and red wine.

super malty aroma is very rich... chocolate, toasted salted cashews, mild vanilla pod, wood and grassiness. 

the palate is definitely straight up sweet though somehow not disgustingly... lots of malt, chocolate, toasted brown sugar candied nuts, buttery caramel, wood and faint notes of coffee. saltiness/umame and warming spiciness on the finish. rich caramel-y aftertaste. alcohol vapors pour out of me as the brew warms and adds another layer of depth and spice. it is quite welcome as it helps to break up some of the stickiness. medium body with a soft creamy mouth feel and thick richness from sugars.

1211,"2008-02-13",3.8,"In short: Above average Doppelbock, true to the style.  Nourishing and complex malt character.
How: Bottle 750ml (many), fresh to 3 months old.
The look: Dark burgundy body topped by a beige ring of foam
In long: Complex malt profile that has a lot going, toasted raisins, earthy and woody notes, figs, maple, berries and red grapes.  A bizarre sensation of chewing on a wet fruit-flavoured cigar.  Theres some woody/oak flavours in there that are stronger than in many oak-aged beers, and this one isnt.  A little sticky and vinous.  Resinous hops and a crisp hard-candy sensation in the finish.  A sipper.  This is to me exactly what a Doppelbock should be although Im far from an expert in the style.

1211,"2007-12-10",3.7,"Dark brown with orange suggestions. Large, uniform, compact initial head slowly gives way. Strong and just very malty nose. I think this contained something like 10 different cereals and its a malt medley indeed. At this young age, the alcohol gives a warming kick, but it does not appear too strong thanks to a friendly accompanying fruitiness that ranges from figs to curranty cabernet grape. Toastiness might be its malts founding father, but its tentacular proliferation ventured into as various field as almond skin, chocolate, maple. If it apparently attenuated a bit more than it was intended to, the body remains dense and filling, despite the active and cleansing carbonation. Authentic and balancing earthy/leafy noble hops in suitable proportions. It is tough to say what would make it more pleasant as it is both clean and rich. Still, I could mention that my very very favourite doppelbocks tended to show a complexity that is even greater and with certainly fewer ingredients. Perhaps time has something to do with it. A velvety nature was also a common factor to them whereas here, the carbonation, albeit never agressive, feels a bit more detached. Also, perhaps, my very favourite doppelbocks tended to have an immediate identity, putting your nose in the glass, you were hinted at which beer youre drinking, there was a perfume associated to the malt labyrinth and layered toastiness. This is not yet here. So what do we have then? Another exquisite, clean, solid staple, offered at a most reasonable price - an additional argument at this brewerys tremendous progress. Confidence is now clearly established.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1211,"2007-12-03",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2009 My Bottom Line:
A nourishing malt baguette sustains a classy fieldberry caramel and  meditating herbal hops in this highly affable yet chewy Doppelbock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-Fluffy foam floats atop a burgundy with fiery orange highlights.
-Some light roastiness peeks through the fresh crusty bread.
-The active carbonation softens up early enough while alleviating the malty heft.
-All malt flavors coalesce intelligently.
-No alcohol is apparent in the flavor profile, which is great.
-The body is subservient and lean for a beer this gravity, letting itself be consumed effortlessly.
-This one is going to grow luxurious, I can feel it.
