2019,"2014-11-21",3.7,"Tap @ Half Acre: Deep, muddy opaque brown with an ecru colored cap, bubbly & slightly foamy, that leaves some nice lacing behind. Aroma of dry roasted coffee beans, a hint of toast, nuts, bitter cacao nibs, & the lightest imaginable undercurrent of cream just to modestly sweeten things up. Flavor has a bit more roast to it, like full-force roast as opposed to just toasted. Reminds me more of a dry porter than a brown ale, really. Lots of dry, dry, cocoa powder, ground up coffee beans, blackened walnuts, & a lingering hint of toffee in the finish that still manages to hide the sweetness away. You get a light dash of creaminess from time to time, but all in all, this is still a pretty roasty & coffee forward bitch. I like it quite a bit.
