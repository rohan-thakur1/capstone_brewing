Flavor has a lot of red fruit and red fruit sourness. Perhaps some red wine in the as well. The sourness is, as often or perhaps always with De Garde beers, almost too much.

3907,"2016-08-07",4.9,"750 ml. bottle sampled @ Epic beer Tasting 2016. MASSIVE GUSHER. Complete fountain, lost about 60  70 % of the bottle. Which is real shame because the beer was astonishingly good, brilliant. I should downrate it because of the gusting, I am just going to rate by the taste. This my 17th De Garde beer, first one to do that, I hope that it is a fluke. Deep berry juice red, little head. Nose is extremely fruit, really reminds me of something, not sure what, this smells like freshly picked fruit & childhood memories, faint green tea notes even. Taste is out of this world, fizzy extreme berries, freshly picked wild dark berry forest fruit, childhood memories & brief green tea like notes. High carbonation. Low lemon sourness, acidic. Ridiculous man. Real shame about the gushing.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
3907,"2016-08-07",4.5,"Explosive gushing to small pink head over fully opaque dark red beer. Out of this world nose, with an aroma I know only from freshly picked black mulberries. Extremely fruity flavour, fruit³, hardly any beer, - but with this, Im the last one to complain. Not very well bodied, but totally fruit-filled. Double bad about the gushing - for the marks, but even worse, for the terrible loss of this nectar of the Gods.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate berries, funk, must, lemon, and sweet tarts. Its a purplish-brown with a large light purple head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of berries. The finish has moderate-heavy sour lemon, funk, and faint must. Its light bodied with moderate-heavy, but not prickly, carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

3907,"2015-07-27",3.4,"How: Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. From kcherney, thanks! 

>>> Decent Berliner Weisse with a very nice berry fruitiness but subpar on every other aspects. 

+  Nice burst of berries at first 
+  The red wine barrel-aging add a bit of complexity and cohesion, but its still far from perfect 
−  Like most De Garde beers, the appearance isnt a selling point. Deep red with a frothy pink head, but no retention 
−  The acidity level is better than most other De Garde, but its still borderline too much and the drinkability is subpar for the style
−  Theres the usual De Garde rotten-something vegetal presence 
−  A bit thin, even for a Berliner Weisse and the fizzy carbonation doesnt help

3907,"2015-05-01",3.7,"Poured from a bottle at the brewery. 
Aroma is very fruity with a bright character and light acidity. Light oak notes. Phenolic notes are similar to seaweed and very fresh fish,but not in a bad way. Lots of boysenberry notes which are an odd smelling berry. 
Pours a dark red with some purple hues and and a moderately sized, somewhat thin head that slowly recedes to the edges. Moderate lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with quite a bit of berry character. Like the aroma, the berry flavor is a bit odd but true to the berries. Light lemon and oak notes. Low bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer but the berries are weird. Nice acidity with balanced berry notes. Works well, but boysenberry es are weird berries.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
