4.0 A: Black color. Two fingers of frothy tan head. Retention is good and plenty of lacing is left.

4.25 S: Decidedly grainy - this reminds me of gathering up the grains needed for my RIS. Theres also a ton of chocolate, which reminds me of the mash of that same brew. Plenty of roastiness as well. Caramel and molasses to round this off.

4.0 T: Roasty foremost, but chocolatety enough to balance it out. Grainy with layers of caramel and the slightest hint of ash. Very tasty and every sip is as good as the last.

3.75 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Lightly creamy and super smooth.

4.0 D: Really good beer. Solid all around. Pick it up.

Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, smoke, light char, and roast/smokey earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark, roast, smoke, and bready malt notes; with great strength.

Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark, roast, smoke, and bready malt notes; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Very clean flavor and finish as well. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a damn nice schwarzbier style.

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance- The beer pours a dark brown color with a two finger brown colored head. The head fades rather fast to leave a lighter level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell-The aroma is sweet of caramel and has a nice backbone of roasted malt and a touch of smoke.

 Taste- The taste begins with some roasted malt and some sweet caramel upfront. As the flavors advance, some flavors of coffee and a bit more roastedness come to the tongue with the dwindling of some of the caramel. A toffee like sweetness replaces the caramel though, maintaining the sweetness of the brew. In the end a light smokiness comes to the tongue leaving a pleasant sweet and roasted flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is average to light with a carbonation level that is on the average side. A slightly thicker body may have been better for the roasted flavors of the brew, although the carbonation level was rather fitting for the drinkability and strength of the beer.

 Overall- A rather decent black lager with a decent flavor and mix between sweet and malt. Rather easy drinking overall.","","Darkmagus82"

Overall: I was expecting a bit heavier beer but I guess being a lager it makes sense it's a bit lighter, I feel the flavor could be a bit more

In the aroma, a bold scent of roasted down malts come through and bring about a smell of chocolate milk. The drink is somewhat bland with a thin palate, but then there is a notice of roast malt that gives this a flavor of an instant coffee pouch that you just add water too.

4409,"2013-04-18",4.0,"I got two bottles of this wonderful black lager when I purchased the Fort Collins lunchbox. Undoubtedly in a mix of beers that were complex, tasty, and very different: Kidd stole the show. When all was said and done I was happy to cross a few new beers off my list, but sad because I wasnt sure where to track down anymore of this wonderful beer. Im a stout lover, so the Chocolate Stout that also came in the sampler was the one I expected to enjoy the most. Kidd, as it would happen was the first one I tried and I was stunned. Pours midnight black with a nice brown head that stood surprisingly tall and long. Aroma is malty and chocolaty, with notes of coffee and smoke. The taste is complex with an excellent mouth-feel. Starts off sweet and tasty, creamy and only slightly viscous, then finishes like a beer should with a nice bitter kick in the pants. Wonderful beer, really nails the best of both worlds in a lager/stout hybrid.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","Europa326"
4409,"2013-02-28",2.3,"Bought in 12oz bottle. It pours pretty dark but not completely opaque. Very little head. The aroma is a little weird and kind of smells like burnt chocolate malt. It pours dark black and you cant see through it until it gets low and you arent looking through much of it. It tastes like a stout made lager style which is kind of weird. After tasting it a bit it also tastes a little  like coke or pepsi. Overall this is an interesting beer that would probably be pretty good if you really liked stouts or lagers and wanted something crazy.","USA","Krej"

Basic chocolate and caramel in the aroma, with a slightly hollow note behind (and a bit papery, stale); pleasant expression, but not nearly enough of it. Medium-light body; medium-light carbonation. Solid amounts of milk and dark chocolate upfront, modest roast and light caramel notes; there may even be a light amount of smoked malt present in here as well, plus a modest spiciness (likened to beef jerky, smoked meat); a touch of lightness / wateriness on the edges, barely noticeable.

The aroma appears to contain an all-malt grain bill, but sweetish in the lager sense. There is a brown-ale-like brown sugar aroma too. Hops are barely there.

The taste is heavily roasted malts, and they come as a surprise. Major mocha/coffee bean taste. Minor pilsnery hop. Amberish malts also come through. Smoky but mild BBQish flavor like a rauchbier. Mild dark chocolate. Unexpected and full of flavor.

4409,"2009-08-09",3.5,"Pours clear amber with mahogany highlights flickering under a soft khaki head. As his head flees the scene of the crime, a bit of aggravation produces a respectable network of lace. Lifting my glass, I dip my nose into his liquid depths. Gentle esters of sweet smoke, maple, brown sugar, pumpernickel bread, and chocolate-covered black cherries mingle and mix in the crowd. Not bad; far less painful than I was expecting. A bit more enthusiastic about his prospects, I draw deep for my first quaff. Light, smoked, and crunchy with brown sugar and maple crunchies. His darker, meatier side is warm pumpernickel bread mingling with maple and chocolate covered cherries. His start and finish are short lived; The Kidd focuses the main brunt of his attack squarely in the middle of his palate, and mine. As my brew approaches the perfect room temperature, gentle esters of freshly brewed coffee and wood make a subtle showing. His permanent underlay of sweet smoke gives way to crunchy red apples for a pleasantly brisk snap to his palate. A simple black lager, to be sure, but I must say that overall, The Kidd Lager from Fort Collins put on a good show, escaping the unforgiving clutches of my inner critic.


Even when I run into bad beer, I still enjoy the adventure, thrill, and joys brought on by the wide world of beer.

Unlike other smoked beers I have that are way too smokly, this was just the right tough to offest the malty sweetness, ending in a nice rounded finish.

4409,"2008-08-19",3.3,"As I pour this into my 25cl tulip glass I get a full, roasted aroma.  The head forms an initially three finger thick, slightly brown, tan color that recedes at a medium pace.  The beer is an opaque black color that shows a stunningly, brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue when held up to the light.  Roasted notes take on flavors of deeply browned bread crust,  black coffee, burnt grain flavors and a soft, but substantial salty smokiness; this last made me look at the bottle & yep there is some smoke malt in the grain bill.  I really like the extra depth that the smoked malt adds to the aroma.

Fairly light bodied with a touch of sweetness to it that is accentuated by the fact that it is a bit cold.  Warming the beer helps a bit, including a boost to the body which seemed a bit thin before.  The finish has a touch of chalkiness to it in addition to a thin smoke note that isn’t nearly as lush and appetizing as it is in the aroma.  A significant roast character provides lost of burnt flavors, a touch of acidity, some astringent burnt grain husk flavors.  A touch of fruitiness seems to be here at times, though it is very subtle, but most reminds me of burnt cherries.  The roast grain here definitely supplies a bit of bitterness to the finish.

This has a great aroma to it, but unfortunately the flavor doesn’t quite live up to the promise of the nose.  Not bad, but the aroma got me expecting something that was quite tasty.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Initial consternation -was expecting a ""golden necktie"" - should have read the bottle:  ""looks dark, drinks blonde"" - anyway, look amazing in the glass - deep ruby-black with a solid mottled tan/beige lasting frothy head.  Smells like a mild porter - dry, deeply roasted with nut and dark chocolate bitterness, smoothly herbal, nice rough peat around the edges.  Taste - really, really damned good - all the roast and herbal bitterness from the aroma, with a bit of lactose tartness and quite a bit of minerally smokey peat to round it out.  Light of body, but nicely astringent, only a moderate amount of carbonation, but the smoke and dry malt last quite a while - simply a well-made, easy-drinking smokey schwarz - and I will look for a sixer of this to show up in Western New York, not just the Fort Collins sampler pack.  Two thumbs up.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Quite inviting, though. Pours dark, opaque brown with a nice khaki head. Not nearly as much smoke on the tongue as on the nose. Sweeter grain, a hint of smoke and a lingering copper essence.

The aroma came off like a smoked beer - smoke, jerky, peat and such.  I do not like smoke in beers in general, especially those that surprise you with it.  Medium smooth body with a decent amount of sharp carbonation.  Once again, even though its not listed anywhere smoke takes the front seat and the traits on the aroma dominate the flavor.  There is some underlying chocolate and roasted malt, but they are hidden pretty well.  The finish adds some spice and coffee-like flavors.  If smoked schwartz is your thing, this may work for you.

There is a light meaty scent in the mix as well. The flavor is really enjoyable.  There is actually a strong smoky coffee presence and an underlying ashy quality that reminds me of a nice stout. Caramel comes out in a sticky fashion that makes it more identifiable as a schwarz, and it works pretty well. The finish lingers on a drying, smoked almond flavor.

Initial flavor of dark roast and milk chocolate than transitions to a nutty middle with faint smoke. Finish is semi dry, slightly acidic,  with a spicy hop bitterness and lingering mineral flavors.

4409,"2006-11-23",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 G.K. Chesterton often characterized Americans by their optimism, and while his caricatures come from the distant turn of the 20th century, I think they remain spot on.  Americans think that a man can come from the gutter, rise to the top of the business or political world and become a model leader for the community.  The English have a tempered version: that a man can stay in the gutter and make himself a better person without the trappings of the rich, rising to the top as a leader of the community and still clad in rags and slippers.  Im much more for this Dickensian approach, having seen it first hand with a little known beer that came in one of my variety packs: Kidd Lager.  The gruff cowboy on the front belies a very un-American beer (Schwarzbier, no less!  We Americans deign to use zs in such a flippant fashion) and the very word lager kept me in an uninterested malaise.  And so, on the day before Thanksgiving, with little to do and much less to think about I chose what I thought would be a vapid and uninteresting brew.  How wrong I was, and how happy for it!  It sits in the glass a dark, dying ember black with a marble of deep red shapeshifting in the center.  The head is a coco colored lace of moderate constitution, grasping at the sides of the glass as it slowly deflates.  It is a charcoal dark beer with matching dark smells.  Rich coffee and bitter dark chocolate combine with a rich flow of heavy, sweet cream and with the pleasant smell of crisp green vegetables.  The taste takes the intensity down a level, showing off what a good sweet malts should be like.  A slightly weakened chocolate, coffee, smoky and crisp flavor turns this Schwarzbier into more of a sweet stout than a lager.  But its lighter than a sweet stout, crisper and more appropriate for milder, temperate weather.  It is an unfortunate case of labeling belying a dark and delicious beer, but when given the chance quickly sheds the Old Western appeal and switches to a Western German look that suits my palate a bit more.  Although not a consummate beer, it nevertheless remains an excellent choice for fans of that peculiar malts character that comes in beers of a darker shade.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
4409,"2006-11-18",1.9,"This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of light brown colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated dark red brown colored body and a good lacing.

Not one that I would buy again.  The label marking it as a lager is misleading.  Its more like a Dunkel.  The aroma matches the flavor and both are just off.

Bitternes is medium and very complementary.  Palate is lively, almost fizzy, but that does almost feel fitting, body is medium light and mouthfeel is dry and crisp.

4409,"2006-09-01",3.5,"Brown-tinged ebony. Light-beige head quickly collapses but forms a thick collar which holds well. Intensely roasty nose of cocoa and coffee. Hints of licorice and deeply toasted bread. Unappealing mouthfeel. Loose, highly gassy carbonation and flimsily bodied. Char and pungent roast sting the palate with a zingy acidity, but the richly textured notes of chocolate and burnt cocoa arrive and lend balance. Malts evoke thoughts of chewy bread which pillar the grittier roast elements. Chocolate malt remains forceful and thickens the aridness while generating more velvety layers of espresso and smoky coffee toward the latter half. Finishes amply malty and chocolaty, yet slightly chalky, softly nuanced with bready malt and dry, acidic char. Has lots of potential as the malts are quite long, deep, and very complex, but the body greatly suffers due to the prominent acidity and obviously-forced carbonation.

4409,"2005-09-09",2.5,"12oz bottle thanks to Brian.  Pours with no visible carbonation yet still produces a head a few seconds after settling in the glass.  Coffee, roasty malt and a charcoal element in the aroma.  Thin, fishy flavor thats unaided by a fizzy mouthfeel.  Watery coffee malt, light dark chocolate under a tart hopping thats reminiscent of tomato soup with pear skins.  Roaty finish.  Im used to the fuller mouthfeel and flavor of Sprechers Schwarzbier so this stuff is underwhelming.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
4409,"2005-08-15",3.7,"Thanks to Secret Santa Crosling!  Deepest brown before black, nice tan head faded slowly.  Coffee aroma.  Flavor was a mixture of dark chocolate and coffee,  dry for the most part, but with a woody sweetness on the finish.  Quite full bodied for the style, enjoyable.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
4409,"2005-08-11",3.8,"Red mahogeney in color, tan head.  A bit of sweet burnt sugar in the nose. Flavors of coffee, chocolate and a slight earthiness. Great body and mouthfeel.  Thanks to hey_kevin for the bottle.","Iowa, USA","brewess"
4409,"2005-08-03",3.3,"Draught.  Pours mahagony with a frothy head and lined lacing.  Chocolate malt roasted caramel malt fruit hop aroma.  Bitter hop and chocolate caramel malt with coffee notes.  Medium bodied and fizzy palate.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
4409,"2005-07-13",3.9,"Thanks for the bottle, hey_kevin. Very dark brown body with a little bit of ruby highlights. The aroma is sweet caramel and a hint of coffee. There is also some roasted peanuts. The taste is light smoky peanuts and some rich caramel in the finish. The mouthfeel is sticky and chewy. This is nicely executed, the way I like a schwarzbier.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
4409,"2005-06-27",3.4,"Thanks to Ernest for this.Almost had a mild tobacco nose to it and it did show up on the tongue too.Mellow roasted malts producing a smokey chocolate flavor.I like  these brews.A nice change from all the whopping IPAs I like.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"
4409,"2005-06-19",3.6,"12oz bottle.  dark, black, barley looks brown in the light...poured with nice head and left some lace as it dropped.  Toasty, Roasty, chocolate aroma.  sweetish, but not overly so...nicely done lager.  Just enough dark malt in it to make it interesting, but still it doesnt just mow over the beer.  some hops show up in the finish too.  nice body too.  Pretty satisfying low alcohol beer.","Nebraska, USA","mdi"
4409,"2005-06-14",3.4,"Clear ruby-brown. Gentle lasting light brown cover doesnt want to lace despite my invitations. Pretty sweet nose. It attacks with a pepsi note, bubblegummy in nature, but shows its skills when it switches to floury dryness, more conventional coffee undertones and heavy toasted, almost roasted bread balancing the melting pot. Chewy grassy hops cut through the honey reminiscent sweetness on the tongue with aptitude. Well executed sour bite kisses the mouthful goodbye and leaves a soft flavour cutting bitterness cleanse the palate. Light bodied, soft carbonation. Pretty good for what it is.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4409,"2005-06-14",3.1,"Clear dark brown body with a thin light brown head. Aroma of crème brulée, chocolate and roasted malt. Flavor of chocolate with very mild roastyness. Light body, dry texture.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
4409,"2005-06-13",3.7,"Pours a VERY dark brown, almost opaque, with a nice tan head. Aroma is grass, and a little chocolate, hints of coffee and caramel as well. Flavor is roasted toffee/caramel, with a nice little grassy/citrus hop undertone.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
4409,"2005-06-06",3.5,"A deep brown beauty in my .5 L glass, with a booming 2"" foamy tan head.  Aroma is rich and bitter - dark molasses, prunes, figs, port and roasted hazelnuts.  Flavor is medium roasted coffee, semi-sweet chocolate chips, oats, cornmeal and coffee cake.  Seems singed, almost charred, like its been licked by open flames.  Rich and creamy body; smooth and subtle on the palate.  Everythings fairly modest.  Finish achieves a satisfying coolness as an unflavored iced coffee.  Simple, but tasty.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4409,"2005-05-18",4.1,"Brown.  Very nice nose, with hints of dried powdery chocolate pieces, chalk, tobacco, coffee, mocha and tiramisu.  Flavor is very rich and smooth, loaded with toffee, caramel, chocolate and mocha flavors, with hints of bark along with a light floral hop finish.  Soft & buttery mouthfeel.  Very flavorful and full in body, especially for its size and style.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
4409,"2005-04-21",3.3,"bottle-pours a very deep red hue almost black with a beige head.  aroma is slightly buttery, chocolate, char and roast.  The butter note i think is diacytl, but its not really that bad.  Dark roasted grain flavors mostly with a touch of sweetness.  light body.  this is average compated to the Sprecher and Rio Salado versions.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
4409,"2005-03-30",3.3,"Near black in color with a moderate light cocoa head.  Aromas of dark malts with grass and corn on the cob. Fairly thick, but enough effervescence to keep things lively. Aroma does improve with a bit of warm-up time and gains some smoke and caramel. Flavors of mild caramel and black malts, just a touch of earth. Not as clean as I prefer this style, but certainly nothing to shoot in the back.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4409,"2005-03-21",3.8,"Thanks to P-drunk for this bottle. Pours a very dark red, very clear when held up to the light, with a tall off-white head. A very nice blend of smokey malts and cherry show through with a light chocolate sweetness up front. Very smooth with a good weight on the palate.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
4409,"2004-11-30",3.6,"Sampled over the holidays thanks to Murph. Very dark lager - full of smoked grain but remarkably clean; however, the palate remains a bit thin despite everything else. Some chocolate peeking through, and a definitive finish that is nothing akin to typical lagers. Good beer.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"
4409,"2004-10-02",2.7,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2013 Bottle. Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is black (but not opaque). Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (roasted grain / coffee, dark chocolate, husks), lightly hoppy (apricot, herbs). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, husky. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Alas, this has become husky of late...used to be quite good, but now just kinda ok.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4409,"2004-08-18",3.0,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2013 Smoky brown malts in the nose, some good roasted malts and a light and somewhat lacking body... very watery roasted wood flavors.  Decent, but not fantastic.  Dark brown hue with a large head.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
4409,"2004-08-10",3.9,"I had this beer on tap at the Fort Collins Brewery. As those who have had this before me have stated, this beer is by far what i would consider their best offering. It pours a ruby red color with a nice tanned head. The aroma is entrancingly nice with smokeyness, a rich vanilla smell, dark brown sugars and malt. The flavor is similar with brown sugars, roasted malt, sweet vanilla and candy, nuts, and a ton more roasty notes. Dry malty finish, very sweet and roasty with a hint of nuts. I must get a sixer of this when it finally gets bottled.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
4409,"2004-06-12",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2004 Nice brown head that lasts. Body is black, only a little light gets through. Taste is slightly smokey and chocolatey, body is nice and malty. This brewery is pretty good! Rerate: Solid, lasting head. Body is frothy, malty. Slightly smoky with a lot of roasted character. Massive amounts of black licorice, especially later in the finish. I can't wait for this to be in bottles!","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
4409,"2004-01-31",3.8,"The Schwarzbier poured a dark black with a thick creamy tan head that quickly went to a collar and laced the glass.  It's aroma is of roasted malt with some hints of chocolate - a little subtle though.  The taste is initially of sweet roasted malts and chocolate with a bitter coffee-like finsh that is slightly acidic.  It was a little thinner than I expected, but was a very easy-drinking beer.  Overall, it reminds me of a sweeter step-child of NBB's 1554.  So far it is my favorite of FCB's offerings.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
