3717,"2016-11-29",2.6,"Man, what is there to say about this? It tastes like horsefeed initially. Thats the problem with malty beers. They are a molasses and barley cocktail. Eventually you forget it and just drink it out of habit. Without habits, this beer stays in the keg.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"

3717,"2015-11-14",3.5,"Can. Pours a dark orange-red-amber with a high, solid, fine-grained, sticky, lacy, off-white head. Nose is raisin bread, roast pecans, treacle, citron, and gentle spice. Solid malt backbone on the tongue with a touch of sweetness; good crusty wheat bread overtone, with roast bitterness underneath. Substantial and authoritative; often Irish reds are wimpy. This ones not. Finish is bitter and clean. I like this beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
3717,"2015-10-18",3.7,"12 oz. can (from Texas Micro 10 pack) served in a shaker- poured a transparent darkened red/maroon color, thin white ring about the glass for a head that did show some evidence of lacing. Aroma of earth, unbaked bread that is proved and ready for some heat, and some light yeast. Hits the mouth with a medium body, malt isnt awash in over sweetness for once, toffee sensations in the middle, finish has a spot of cream that dries out over time. Interesting brew, and decent.","Austin, Texas, USA","mmmbeer"

3717,"2014-11-16",3.0,"On tap at the brewery. Light red pour with an off white head. The aroma has some toffee notes and grass. The flavor is very similar, with some very earthy hop character and some toffee and caramel. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I am not a fan of red ales, so the score will not be as high as it likely would be for someone who is a fan of the style.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
