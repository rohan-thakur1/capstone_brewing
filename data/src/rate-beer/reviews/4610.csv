4610,"2017-06-21",3.0,"12 oz bottle from Whole Foods Bowery. 1200th NY beer rating!
A cloudy pale yellow beer with large and foamy bright white head. Clove / spice, wheat, and banana over some tropical fruit juice notes on the aroma. Fruit comes through more on the flavor, but its still more of a wheat beer with a little fruit added. Lively carbonation. Okay mouthfeel. Eh.

4610,"2017-06-11",3.2,"This is alright. The fruit is there but its subtle, you can still taste the base beer and tell that its a pretty good wheat beer. It pours hazy yellow with a lot of foam. The aroma is the usual yeasty, banana type wheat beer thing. There is some presence of the mango and passion fruit adding a tangy quality to the smell. The fruit is on the flavor, too, in the finish, after a warm malt and some dry hop kick.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"
4610,"2017-06-09",4.0,"Hazy golden coloured body with a pale straw glow and a nice, three centimetre tall pure white head. Aroma of light fruit, peaches, pears, coriander seed, grass and a good deal of wheat and yeast noticeable, very nice and light throughout. Light-bodied; Fresh coriander seed flavour with a lot of bright fruit notifeable, with pears and apriots noticeable throughout. Aftertaste shows some sweet finishes with a lot of fresh flavours, a bit dose of yeast and wheat and a touch of sour bitter funk near the end. Overall, a nicely robust beer, that is very light and super easy-to-drink with a refreshingly light characteristic and a touch of fruits noticeable throughout which make this even better. A great beer to try and recommended if you can find this one at all! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased yesterday from Whole Foods in New York (Columbus Circle), New York on 08-June-2017 for US$2,99 sampled in my hotel room here in Midtown Manhattan, New York on 09-June-2017.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
4610,"2017-06-05",3.5,"Pale, milky lookin straw yellow pour, big ass white frothy head with exceptional retention and lacing. Im not gonna say a whole lot about this beer other than yeah, its well-made... and also: I dont really get the concept of dry hopping any yeast driven style of beer. Several breweries in  the post-modern era of hops have done this kinda thing. And this another prime example of an apparently very well executed beer that has all this tropical hoppy heavy-handedness grabbing a big green crowbar and bludgeoning three shades of fuck out of most every feature characteristic defining the base beer style. Not to mention passion fruit and mango are pungently fruity which brings a whole other bag of masking agents to the fiesta. That said, its perfectly crushable. Just not what Id say is exemplary of a Witbier.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
4610,"2017-05-31",3.6,"12 ounce bottle. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with some fruit in the nose and a slightly tart body with coriander and noticeable passion fruit.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
4610,"2017-05-26",3.6,"12 ounce bottle. Hazy orange, large frothy white head, good retention. Aroma of pine, guava, mango, pale malt. The taste is guava, mango, kiwi (kinda impressed they actually pulled that out!), pale malt. Medium bodied, juicy. Nice!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

4610,"2017-05-25",3.9,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/22/2017. Pours hazy pale golden/straw color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lightly tart/tangy passion fruit, mango, kiwi, orange, peach, melon, lemon, pear, apple, coriander, citrus peel, coriander, clove, pepper, light banana, wheat, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, fruits, spices, citrus/fruity hops, and moderate pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of big lightly tart/tangy passion fruit, mango, kiwi, orange, peach, melon, lemon, pear, apple, coriander, citrus peel, coriander, clove, pepper, light banana, wheat, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate yeast spiciness, herbal bitterness, and light fruit tartness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart/tangy passion fruit, mango, kiwi, orange, peach, melon, lemon, pear, apple, coriander, citrus peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, fruits, spices, citrus/fruity hops, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/tart/spiciness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness, fruit tartness, and carbonation; increasing through the glass. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly acidic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is a delicious fruited witbier style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, fruits, spices, citrus/fruity hops, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful for the ABV; with great balance between fruits and classic witbier character. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

4610,"2017-05-15",3.9,"a very nice hoppy ale rife with rank malt like infected WEEDS, broomstraw, and earwax. hints of fruit as mentioned but the clincher is the PINE hop and malt character melded so well with the chewy wit body. simply a superior and demonstrative wit. which aint so simple. power and a wit beer YOU GOT IT. take it with a good cigar.","New Jersey, USA","BREWMUSKCLES"

4610,"2017-05-06",3.7,"Banana nutty clove Belgian yeasty aromas with some stonefeuit in the finish. The fruit is slight, and the body is light and refreshing. Has a bit of a earthy funk to the finish. Almost seems like their witte, slightly watered down, with some fruit added, then refermented. Fruit is dry and not sweet but body is lacking. For $10 a six pack though it is a reasonable easy drinking summer beer. Enjoyable.","East Greenbush, New York, USA","Mep3222"
