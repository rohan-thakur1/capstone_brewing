3254,"2017-06-17",5.0,"Pours a hazy, muddled golden-peach colour, initially generating nearly two fingers of soapy, bright white foam at the surface. It steadily dissipates over the course of the next five minutes or so, leaving a creamy-looking collar and thin cap behind in its wake. A quick swirl manages to give the head new life, but only briefly; this is also the only way I seem to be able to get much in the way of lace. It might not win a tripel beauty contest, but the aroma is absolutely to die for. I'm getting a wallop of stone fruit on the nose, especially apricots and juicy peach, with distinct notes of lemon peel, orange zest and white grape. Subtle banana esters, clove phenols and candi sugar sweetness, with grassy hay and some spiciness.

I love the taste of most tripels, and this one is not an exception to the rule. Grainy malts, candi sugar sweetness and banana are apparent right off the starting gun, though the stone fruit and citrus elements noted in the aroma are somewhat subdued here. Hints of apricot, apple skin, white grape and orange peel surface briefly, only to be overcome on the back end by this beer's assertive yeasty qualities - plus a little help from some grassy, spicy hops. Finishes spicy, with suggestions of clove, white pepper, and a light, bready malt sweetness. Not particularly dry, though the aftertaste does have an astringent tendency. Medium in body, with fiercely potent carbonation that prickles the surface of the palate and foams up in the mouth. I like a good, crisp bite from my tripels, but this bottle goes a little overboard. No biggie; it happens sometimes with these bottle-conditioned Belgians - it's still an exquisitely well-crafted beer that completely masks its strong alcohol content.

Final Grade: 4.38, a brown-nosing A grade. I'm far from impartial when it comes to tripels - particularly when it comes to the ones which have been imported directly from Belgium. So it really shouldn't be surprising when I state that I highly recommend Gouden Carolus Tripel, or that I find it to be one of the finest examples of the style that I've had in recent memory. It's certainly not flawless - with the unnecessarily foamy mouthfeel being my main point of contention - but the fact remains that I'm still really enjoying my glass.

3254,"2017-03-17",5.0,"Très belle robe dorée transparente, avec des reflets légèrement cuivrés, surmontée dune très épaisse écume blanche à bulles fines. Le nez est enchanteur et rappelle immanquablement la Tripel Karmeliet. Les arômes sont riches et complexes, donc il va falloir un peu de doigté pour les détailler... Les malts sont suaves avec des notes de miel, de chocolat au lait et de gelée de coin. On distingue un côté floral fort intéressant qui dispute aux notes végétales des houblons. Le fruit nest pas en reste avec des arômes nets dabricot et de pêche, de kiwi, de citron vert, de pamplemousse, de raisin, de pomme, de poire, de reine-claude, de cerise griotte, de melon, de banane... Cest capiteux à souhait et extrêmement gourmand. En bouche, lalcool nous invite au voyage tout en souplesse et surtout, la texture est dune douceur incroyable. On dirait quon déguste un nectar de fruit, cest impressionnant ! La carbonatation est vive et vient redonner un coup de peps à lensemble. Les sucres sont agréables et rappellent vraiment la Tripel Karmeliet qui pour moi est la bière qui se rapproche le plus de cette Carolus Tripel. Lamertume est là, tapie dans lombre, elle fait son office en sous-main, jamais ostentatoire mais toujours à luvre, en particulier sur le bout de la langue après quelques secondes. On relève aussi de belles notes citronnées vivifiantes. On retrouve en bouche toutes les saveurs du nez, la fleur et le fruit en particulier labricot, omniprésent. La longueur est bonne, sur les malts, le fruit, une pointe de poivre agréable et excitante, cette très légère amertume et un alcool dune finesse incroyable. Le final est à limage de cette triple : en douceur, riche, souple, complexe et si simple à la fois. En poursuivant la dégustation après 10 bonnes minutes de sage repos, la bière soxygénant un peu, je retrouve des arômes de fraise surpuissants que je navais pas encore décelé. Incroyable... Du très très grand art comme seul Het Anker et quelques autres brasseries de haute-voltige savent nous offrir... Bouteille 33cl, Boissons du Monde, Saint-Egrève.","Grenoble, FRANCE","Zarrach76"

3254,"2016-08-27",4.5,"La Gouden Carolus Tripel serait brassée depuis 1491 et pour être précis, à son origine, élaborée pour les chevaliers de la toison dor. En versant le fameux breuvage dans mon calice, je me voyais en effet très bien en chevalier à la recherche de son Graal, et tout dabord par la noblesse certaine que présente la Gouden Carolus Tripel en verre. 
Sa couleur est dun superbe blond doré, et elle est dotée dune très forte effervescence et dune mousse blanche abondante et homogène. 
Au nez, les flaveurs sont largement citronnées, arrondies par des effluves de blé et corsées par une pointe de coriandre.
A la dégustation, cest limpression de puissance qui prédomine. Après une première attaque, fraîche sur le citron et le blé, la seconde attaque, sur lamertume et le houblon, est dune corpulence exceptionnelle. Les arômes, liquoreux, de sauternes et riesling vendanges tardives, sont particulièrement développés. Lalliance malt, houblon et levure joue à merveille. La finale, longue, vous fait alors apprécier toute lamertume de cette bière.
Les 9 % Abv sont largement adoucis par un taux de sucre important. Ceci pourrait expliquer le conseil de dégustation à 7°C, température particulièrement basse et donc surprenante. En dégustant la Gouden Carolus Tripel à température ambiante, comme me la récemment conseillé un sage zythologue, celle-ci vous laissera découvrir toutes ses saveurs et sa complexité. Cependant la présence dun fort taux de sucre résiduel vous laisse une impression sucrée marquée en lèvre et en fin de dégustation une bouche pâteuse.

Looks: Cloudy hazy golden light honey colour with a thin ring of yeast sediments; One and a half finger head and long-lasting crumpety white foam; Excellent sticky lacing with very fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant sweet malt, with banana, vanilla, caramel, strong alcohol, light dark fruits, sugar, bread, strong Bel yeast, light lemon and thin grass.

Taste: Med to strong sweet malt, with banana, caramel, dark fruits, strong alcohol, sugar, spices, strong Bel yeast, strong lemon, quite strong bitter hops and herbal grass.

Body: Mid to full body. Very creamy and slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Very good maltyness in rich background, very smooth and creamy. Booze is strong but not harsh, and strong herbal hops reigns. Banana and dark fruit esters make their presence felt but took a back seat. Sweetness is good and just right with the herbs. Joyful!

Hoppiness: Light lemon and thin grass in nose, and much stronger in taste. Bitterness has strong herbal influence for a lasting, mid-to-high astringent sweet malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Creamy, boozy and hoppy to mouth.

Comments: I had high expectation with the Gouden Carolus brand and this Tripel surely lives up - rich smooth body, surgically and tasty booze and hoppiness to the style, with strong herbs and spice mixed with just-right sweetness.

Aromas of big lemon, orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Quite dry on the finish as well for the gravity. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding tripel style.

Bitter, slightly tart, again very floral and aromatic. No alchool taste at all, but the drinkability is rather poor. Fizzy carbonation, light body, slightly oily texture.

Taste begins with sweet exotic fruits, banana, orange, mango, kiwi; rather strong, minerally carbonation, fluffy and smooth mouthfeel, full and malty, sweet, bready, yeasty, with retronasal aromatic spiciness (spices are clearly effectively used here), a tad sugary but nowhere cloying, very honeyish, finishing with dryish but gentle, herbal hops and brandy-like warming alcohol, clearly present and just a little bit wry but not too obtrusive, while the initial sugary and malty sweetness remains, as well as the drying spiciness.

Really, really nice Belgian. And for $2.50 a bottle? Unbeatable. Unbelievable! Id have to say its an even better quality-for-price ratio than Leffe! If it werent for the fact that the best before was last week, Id go back to the store and buy out everything they had on the shelf. Mind you, Im convinced theres nothing at all wrong with it now.

A nice popped when the cork came off, it pours, straight from the fridge, a 3/4 foam to 1/4 liquid mix. I can now see a hazy light golden brew that certainly leaves some nice lacing behind.

A big yeasty aroma I get followed by some cloves, some banana, and a nice touch of some hoppy bitterness but, not too much, mind you.

The taste is lovely. I get more banana and clove with some hints of bubblegum in the taste and the hoppy bitterness is in the taste too and I like it! Theres some other spice here that reminds me of cinnamon, or is it nutmeg? How aboot both so Im covered..

Medium and smooth bodied, medium carbonation, smooth as silk this is with pretty much no presence from the hefty abv.

This is one of those beers I would love to love more. Without wanting to diss it, it sometimes feels like this beer is appreciated for the fact that it has momentum instead of having momentum because its so good. Theres just no getting around Gouden Carolus the last 2 years or so.
The tripel seems to get very alcoholy and agressive after a while, that feeling where you get slightly annoyed and confused after the first few sips have settled. Its still a solid beer, but living in Belgium that means it ranks with a lot of other good strong blondes, so it misses punch. 
That does mean its pretty balanced though, instead of being another one of those modern beers with momentum gained by the original or hoppy flavors.
Just to be clear, the brown one is a whole different story and one of the best beers out there.","BELGIUM","Virvo"

3254,"2013-09-17",3.5,"11.2 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a golden orange color with vibrant carbonation. Even with a gentle pour, this forms an aggressive, billowy head about four fingers high. Its off-white in shade with a wonderful consistency and impressive/frustrating retention. The lacing it leaves behind is plentiful, as well. This looks just about perfect in the proper glassware (cough).

S: Theres a vibe of both peppers - both black pepper and less-pleasing green bell pepper - and citrus, namely orange. Honey, too. I dont seem to get much of the apple/pear/bread notes typical of Belgian yeast at first, but they pop up once the beer opens up. Nicely complex, even if not every note is perfect.

T: This one is pretty sweet. Honey is the first (and most assertive) flavor I notice, which lasts all the way to the moderately long finish. More typical yeast notes slowly enter past the midpoint, drying out the sweetness (somewhat). The back end also has notes of vanilla and mineral water. Dare I suggest its even metallic? Other than that foible, its decent.

M: What seems like a sweet brew at first becomes pretty dry. Only as it warms up does (mild) alcohol become noticeable - still nothing to detract from the experience. To me, it loses its carbonation a bit too soon, though thankfully it doesnt make this one too syrupy. Good drinkability for a tripel...which means it has great drinkability by regular standards.

O: Pretty good tripel. Not an amazing one, because it doesnt hit all my preferred style buttons the right way (Im not a huge fan of the slight metallic finish, and the booze doesnt quite have that just concealed enough quality of the top-flight tripels). Doubt Id buy it again, but Id never refuse a sample.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

The quite strong flavours have all the right components: spices, Belgian yeast, fruits and a pleasant alcoholic sting, but unfortunately there are some disturbing chalky dry notes of bakers yeast. The chalkiness creeps in mid-palate and ruins the aftertaste. The chalk makes the mouthfeel very dry and not that pleasant. The body is medium and the carbonation is prickling lively. An ok tripel.

Low carbo for a Belgian tripel. Truly a dessert tripel - any chance of ever brewing this without the added liquid sugars? Surely malts, yeast and hops this fine can do without the cloying palates of yesteryears preference? // Rerate after many BH tasting 33cl bottles: fresh, natural lemon and flowery aroma makes this tripel worth while digging in and offsets the banana and peach compote fruit sugars, adding balancing dryness.

A little bit of bitterness on the side does not allow it to lose refreshing qualities. Body is medium, texture creamy and slightly slick as well, carbonation lively or even fizzy.

Sweetness, fruit, mild citrus, closes on a hoppy note, the 9.0% ABV is quite obvious.  Mouthfeel is the familiar richness of a  Belgian Tripel but ruined a bit by that carbonation.

The taste is that of a tripel, not the strongest nor the most bitter one; the hops bitterness is tempered by malts, its quite alcoholic but doesnt bring a full-blown glow. The sugars are subtly present, rather providing balance than really sweetening the brew. The aftertaste is mostly grainy.

En uklar gul øl med gærrester og stort luftigt skum - herligt. Duften leder tankerne hen på en ekstrem witbier. Der er masser af lavendel i aromaen, men også blomster, syrligsød malt, lidt alkohol og lidt karamel. Den er mere kompleks end som så. Der er masser af kant i lavendelduften, som jeg ikke rigtig kan finde ord for, men lækker er den, duften. Smagen er sød og gæret, samt med en anelse alkohol, hele øllen igennem. Den er mindre kompleks end forventet. Eftersmagen byder på en smule lavendel, alkohol og en solid bitterhed allerbagerst på tungen. Jeg havde forventet mere blidhed og blomster.  Den kunne godt være både tykkere og blødere. Alt i alt en ganske drikkelig øl, men ikke oppe i toppen af toppen, som den samlede score ellers kunne antyde.

Aroma is very bready, also has a strong yeast presence, slightly sweet, and maybe its just me but it has somewhat of a lager-like aroma.  After pouring the entire bottle it has a cider-like sweetness in the nose.  Taste is very smooth and complex, some of the yeasty blonde ale attributes are there but theres also a fruity backing with a small hint of spice.  To me theres an apple-like sweetness in the back, cider like but without a ton of carbonation.  Very enjoyable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

3254,"2011-04-14",2.9,"Picked up a single bottle of this at the Total Wine in Alexandria. Served in a Jackie Os snifter.

The pour brings a brew with a light apricot body as well as a three-finger head with quite a bit of retention. Rocky, moon-like surface with quite a few bubbles on top. The nose immediately brings some light bubblegum character along with a healthy dose of clove. Theres a slight toffee character underlying what is coming from the yeast.

The taste immediately comes forward with a strong grain presence and a bit of light sweetness. Along with a bit of white pepper spice and clove, there is some light pear character as well as some slight stone fruits. There isnt the sort of underlying complexity that I would expect here. Additionally, there is also a bit of light apple character. The toffee notes that come from the nose are here as well, and this seems to be a bit heavy on the malt and does not bring nearly enough yeast character.

The feel is medium with a bit of sweetness in the finish. I really would like a lot more coming out of the yeast here, as this is seems to really be lacking in complexity when compared with better examples of the style, and certainly when compared to quite a few other Het Anker brews.

3254,"2010-03-28",4.0,"Bottle.  Orange-hued body, hazy, sparkling, topped with a big, creamy white head, fluffy, coating the glass with lace, good retention.  Aroma is fruity, orange, grassy, light and spicy with licorice, anise, apple, and allspice.  Palate is medium with plentiful, creamy carbonation that fills the mouth.  Flavor is lightly sweet, orange, apple, licorice, wet grass.  Finish is smooth, lightly hopped, lightly tart, apple skin, licorice, lasting and mild.  Some alcoholic warmth as the beer comes to room temp.  This beer goes down really easy and is very refreshing.  2-3 of these could disappear in short order.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

3254,"2010-03-18",2.9,"(33cl bottle, bb: 24.03.07. Well, Gouden Carolus website assured at least three years of tenability so I was willing to take a shot)
Orangish color, nice white head; very odd nose, to say at least, I cant quite put my finger on it: yeah, perfume, maybe, but if it was I myself wouldnt in a million years spray that perfume on me going out at evening, some sweet fruits and vanill sugar - and then my associations led me to a garage full of oil, gas and carwheel smells, but that you can put on my wild imagination, I quess; body was medium, carbonation high; flavor didnt fall much behind the nose in terms of strangeness, but it was fairly enjoyable: sweet fruits and candy sugar with kind of leathery aftertaste. Certainly this was interesting, thats for sure, but was it any good? Barely.","Vantaa, FINLAND","rmasa"

The aroma is full of wonderful peppery coriander and aromatic hops. The flavor is also full of citruses and mild hop resin oils.

Smooth and soft with a bit of alcohol bit. medium bodied... nice spicy and candy finish. The spice has good legs for the finish. Did I mention that I went old school on the tunes this whole time? W.A.S.P. self titled. Blow me.

OK. I saved the sediment from each of the 4 bottles I just drank and poured them all into one glass and then slammed it back. I tell you, that may be one of the best glasses of beer Ive ever had. Woop Woop! My poor liver...","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

3254,"2009-06-11",3.2,"16.9  fl oz.  Pours a beautiful gold with just the right amount of head.  Nice aroma, though, nothing to rave about.  Wow, the taste is initially sweet and malty, but then theres this explosion metallic taste, like I was sucking on a dirty penny.  Not great.  Not as bad as the Donker I just drain poured, but not good. This must be skunked, or it was stored improperly...  Either way, I dont think I got the best version of this one.

TECHNICAL: Bottle Poured a slightly hazy, medium golden with an average to large, foamy, white head that slowly diminished and kept a thick sheet leaving excellent lacing in thick sheets on the side of the glass. The aroma was moderate malt, moderate yeast along with fruit, spices and flowers. The initial flavor was sweet and acidic; while the flavor was bitter and slightly sour with a long duration. There was candy sugar, yeast, fruit, flowers, spices and a lot more that I couldnt even begin to describe. The medium to full body was dry with very fizzy carbonation and a dry and light astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

The smell is sweet with yeast and lemon being the biggest aspects of the smell; I could also pick caramel and banana, as beer got warmer. The beer feels thick and smooth in my mouth with not too much carbonation. Full, full flavour doesnt taste watered down one bit. Theres kind of an orangey wood flavour to this brew and I like it. Yeast is an other flavour that quit prevalent, I also got creamy caramel at the back of my throat. The beer has lots of creamy citrus juice flavours hidden in the taste, this is a very complex beer.

Opened with a pop, small foam snake appeared soon afterwards. Needed 2 glasses it was so full of head.

Pleasant pale malts come over next, then a touch of flowery perfume. Very light and crisp. Unbelievably soft palate, the carbonation that created the head doesnt fizz in the mouth at all. Loads of retronasal esters, almost bubble-gummy in places. Taste is full, sweet, and soft light malts. Hops are very restrained, quite clear but not imposing, altogether pretty well balanced.

Very fine carbonation and not a lot of alcohol taste for a 9% beer.  One weird aspect of this beer is that it makes your taste buds feel as if baby orajel was rubbed on them.  Tongue is not numb, only your taste buds.  But this feel eventually subsides. Another aspect of this beer is the fact that the banana and clove flavor don’t determine its flavor.

3254,"2008-08-19",4.1,"Golden straw. Voluminous white head smatters intricate lacework all over the glass. Lovely aromas of pineapple, pear, honeydew, lime peels, airy phenols, peppery hops, and candy sugar intermingle with hints of licorice, bubblegum, and sweet vanilla-cake maltiness. Quite vibrant and complex. Firm effervescence tickles the palate. Succulent yet dry with an explosion of fresh oranges and pineapple combined with a savory tandem of herbal and floral hops. Malts are clean and pillowy, and the combination of puttylike yeast and tropical fruit esters adds to the soft feel and uplifting nature despite the high alcohol. Hops continue to contribute their zesty sparkle while evoking thoughts of aniseed and lime peels as they tease the tongue with a pleasantly tight and refined bitterness. Rich wafery malts bolster the bodys core with a well-textured softness which echoes the faint candy sugar remnants. Zingy alcohol complements the peppery hops and neutralizes some of the sweetness before warming the gullet. Bright tangerine is sandwiched between the  zippy dryness and sugary malts at the finish, before a seamless transition to  feisty lingering snippets of coriander, snappy phenols,  and herbal hops. This has always been a solid beer, but I especially like this  particular bottling with all its cohesiveness and interesting yeast- and high-fermentation-derived  nuance.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Small spots of lace are left on the glass but not much. The aroma is richly perfumey with resiny, oily, spicy aromatics and some notes of sweet fruit and cakey malts. The fruity aromas are hard to place - tropical, perhaps some citrus, fruity liqueur (thanks to the hint of ethanol in the aroma), and made more interesting with a touch of exotic spice. The flavor is complex, just like the nose. There is a strong fruitiness at the tip of the tongue - melons, papaya, mango, pineapple, and citrus.As the beer travels slightly back - squarely between tip of tongue and mid-palate - spices emerge along with tartness and a touch of sharp alcohol flavors. At mid-palate, there is an earthy bitterness combined with bitterness from the alcohol which balance sweet malts, tropical fruit esters, and a light peppery spice. A bready malt flavor also becomes apparent, including a strong taste of wheat. The finish is crisp and long, fairly dry, and alcoholic. The mouthfeel is crisp and rich - both well carbonated and oily and somewhat thick. As the beer warms the flavor of ethanol strengthens, giving the finish a boozy character. Overall, a wonderfully complex Belgian Tripel.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Powerful aromas of bready malt and grain. Banana bread and some toasted marshmallow come just behind the malt.  Definite toffee and caramel continue the sweetness while the alcohol sneaks in behind then surprises you. Flavors are quite deep and complex (especially compared against all the ho hum tripels that have flooded the market). Malt, dark brown sugar start up front and roll back on your tongue while fading through and dark, almost burnt, caramel. Further back some apple and a bit of ""green"" harshness that can be best described as green tree bark. Toasted marshmallow shows up in the flavor as well. Perhaps just a slight cardboard in the back but it doesnt distract you. If anything it adds a certain level of depth.

Gouden Carolus Triple poured a slightly hazy peach that glows when held to the light. A loose airy 1+ finger white head formed on the pour but receded to a ring around the glass within seconds. Leaves no lacing. 

This is one fruity and spicy tripel. Big aromas of pear and granny smith apple greet you as soon as you stick your nose in the glass. Candi sugar and spicy alcohol follow close behind adding a nice depth. 

Candi sugar sweetness and big juicy peach start things off with a bang. A pear grittiness and mild green apple show up mid palate along with a doughy malt base. Spicy alcohol, mild clove and a yeasty fruitness come along on the finish that make this one great tasting tripel.

Body is on the lighter side of medium with a velvety feel when hitting the tongue. The seeming lack of carbonation is in the mouthfeel but in small doses. Just enough to make the body velvety smooth.

This is a danderously drinkable tripel considering the high abv. My glass is disappearing far to quickly.

One of the better tripels so far expierenced in my drinking days. Good popping fruitiness with an exceptionally spicy and deep alcohol and yeast quality. Wonderful beer.

Initial honey-caramel-burnt sugar sweetness is short-lived, then comes the star of the show: an awesome balance of that sweetness, a mildly hoppy bitterness, and the alcohol.

No hop presence in the finish for a triple, and the yeast was also noticeably absent. Mouthfeel was smooth, honey/mead-like.

A faint touch of yeast, light malts, spice and perfume linger in the background. Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced between the velvety smooth and creamy texture of a big beer and the expected tingle of CO2 from a Belgian Ale. Flavor profile a bit more assertive than the aroma. Starts out with a fruity, malty sweetness; very much like the nose. Then gradually moves into a slight peppery, spicy alcohol presentation and finally finishes with a somewhat surprising, but slightly astringent moderately bitter hoppy finish.

Sweet, soapy lemon shine aroma is aided by shrocked lemon rind shavings, lemon-pistachio buttercream, coriander, vanilla beans and banana taffy. Sweet, creamy bananas meld with a lemon saltwater taffy character. Fluffy effervescence is well met by the dry, lemon buttered sourdough. Chewy sorghum and a sweetened papaya-banana smoothie characteristic eventually spinn into a dry, tropical and citric outtake. Full-bodied, followed by a sharp, dry cotton bitterness. Marigolds with a creamy nectar blanket envelops the palate with a vanilla mint creamy glossiness at the end.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The first aroma that hit me was bubble gum and then came a sweet fruitiness accompanied by pepper, coriander and honey ... very yummy. The body was medium with a very active carbonation level and a slight syrupy texture. The flavor starts out moderately sweet with honey, fruits and spices. This sweetness stays consistent through the long finish and is completed by a big alcohol warmth in the chest.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"

3254,"2006-12-31",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2009 Bottle, 75cl corked. Two years past BB-date. It pours a slightly hazy, sparkling golden body with a gigantic creamy off-white head. Fine lacings left. Slightly cellary or corked on the nose, with pale malt, fruityness, some citrus hints and spices and a little piney note. Well hidden alcohol. Warming, effervescent and full-bodied. Slightly cellar-like flavor too, with citrusy, piney hops, some bitterness balancing the white sugar sweetness, and a herbal touch. Pale malts as well. Also something reminiscent of dried apricots. Lasting finish with good warmth and a fine bitterness. Its probably better when fresh, but the two extra years of cellaring sure as hell didnt ruin it. Rating: 7-4-8-4-16-3.9.

3254,"2006-10-03",3.8,"Pours with a clear, rich, concentrated gold color and is topped by an easily three-finger thick, frothy, light tan colored head that leaves some lacing on the sides of the glass.  The aroma is quite herbal; perhaps a mix of fermentation character, hops and even a touch of grassy malt.  Notes of vanilla peak through a base of dry weeds (which give this some sharp biting notes), .  There is a nice aromatic note of both sweet and toasty malt here that has vague nuances of butterscotch, a just lightly malty caramel note, some dry soda cracker notes, and the aforementioned grassy grain character.  There is a touch of higher alcohols in the nose, which only seem to accentuate that sharp, sort of weed-like herbal note that seems to be the most dominant note.

Sharp up front with a herbal astringent note, but the beer immediately softens up a bit with a sweet malt character.  Notes of honey are certainly in evidence and mix quite well with the herbal notes; the combination makes me think of some sort of greenish wild flower nectar.  This beer has a way of lightly sticking to the palate, letting one no that this is not a beer to take lightly, though it certainly drinks a bit lighter than its alcohol content might suggest.  Back to that sharpness, it seems to be a combination of higher alcohols and some phenolic notes, neither of which are out of control and in fact add a touch of balance to the sweetness that might otherwise be dominating.  Speaking of phenolics there is a definite note of clove here, which tends to accentuate the sweet malt.  There are also some noticeable fruit notes here, predominantly pear, green apple, and tart plum.

This is an interesting beer; sweet yet astringently dry at times; palate sticking, yet light enough to be quaffable.  There is definitely enough sharp rough edges here to balance the sweet malt and fruit notes.  At times this beer is incredibly enjoyable, but at other times there is something (that I can’t quite put my finger on) that seems a bit off kilter.  It is not enough to negate my enjoyments, but it certainly makes me ponder, and perhaps that is a good thing anyway.  In the end not being able to fully grasp this beer makes it that much more intriguing.

3254,"2006-10-02",4.6,"Caged and corked 750 pours a solid golden yellow and stands in the glass with a mightly glow like that of lava. Huge dense cap of firm white foam floats ever so loftily to the height of about two inches with ease. Keeps about a half inch of it always sitting. Mega impressive. Light streams are noticeable along the glass edge within the golden glow of color. Lacing is delicately patched in moderate splotches. A looker of an ale.

Aroma is medium or so in tone with a grassy edged citrus of tangerine, pineapple, and dullish lemon. Little perks of peppery spice and bubble gum esters makes for some fun notings on the nose as it warms. Caramel becomes a bit more evident as well.

Taste is firm and solid with a wonderfully thick caramel loaded malt thats completely laced with all sorts of fun citrusy spices and yeast play. Mild, dullish flavors that last and last are what makes this quite spectacular. The caramel totally backs up this floral spiced citrus thats super dulled with a slimming after thickness in a plummy orange marmalade and lemon/pineapple jam. Sugary and darkly sweet and totally yummy. Nice little mixing yeasty spice and grab with a complexing feel and thick play and the palate.

So, along with that, this has the perfect body and feel for a Triple. At least the way I favor them. Thick, smooth, and fairly beefy with malt. Great lasting flavors and finish with a slender side to its spice and citrus thats quite sugary thick and playful just like the candy it simulates. The caramel is divine in this stuff. Lovely. Warm. Tasty and lengthy. The 9% is barely evident as it warms gradually throughout each sip adding to its sippable, yummifingly yummyness.

Drinkable to the point of easy going sipping with an intriguing pull for more after each one of those sips. A Solid F*ckin Tripel !

Now- to tap into my ""mixologist"" side- to create a ""Kicked Up"" Triple, pour a 11.2 Fl Oz. bottle into a trappist goblet, and then.... add a 1/2 shot of Yukon Jack Canadian Liquor. The high alcohol does NOT dissipate the head of the beer and adds to the sweetness (and strength!) It compliments the taste wonderfully! Dont go overboard with the Yukon Jack- use it in the following proprotions: for every 11.2 Oz., use a half a shot of Yukon Jack.

A big dense and creamy white head formed atop a hazy orange-gold body. Head lasted the distance and left a web of lace down the glass. Intense, treacly sweet candi sugar nose with a strong balance of pears, apples and zesty oranges. Only a light amount of yeast and alcohol spice, peppery, was detectable and this came through long into drinking. In the mouth a blend of zesty fruity esters, prickly, medicinal and mellowing alcohol and yeast spice, and sweet candi and vanilla were amplified by the high carbonation that moved things along quickly. Light fresh herb flavours and leafy hops come in in the back and dry out with the alcohol to follow through to a long warming and reasonably smooth swallow. Light in body and filling in the stomach, this was a lovely beer, perfect for the winter,  that came highly recommended by the boys at the Intl beer shop, W. Leederville, and for that I thank them.

Good thing I was ready for it. It has a very high level of carbonation, almost like a dry champagne. It poured out a deep golden yellow color, with a humongous white head. The head was loose and frothy, not tight like some triples. Aromas are of sweet Timothy hay, slight caramel cream aromas, and some yeasty bread. No hops aromas, but it has a very slight hops bite in the middle of the flavors. Flavors are of light caramels, some slight candi sugars, sweet pilsener malts, and of course, the yeast. Gentle vanilla flavors as well. Not much in the way of phenols, cloves or bubblegum. Gentle fruitiness to it, not overpowering at all. Finishes rather in the middle, neither sweet nor dry.

 With the sediment in the glass, this Triple pours a murky golden brown, and a fluffy white head thick and luscious! 
 The aroma is full with huge notes of caramel, cotton candy, even some butterscotch very malty and full with brown sugar and plums. 
 Ok, so maybe Im a little buzzed from that last 750 of Allagash Triple but this so different! Far more toasty malt flavors, darker fruits, plums, apricots, raisins, even some stewed cabbage and corn-beef likeness but I think it might just be the black pepper similarities that Im equating here. 
 Sweet, with notes of rosemary and cove very nice! Its just so very different from the 24ozs of the Allagash!?theres SO much more brown sugar, and molasses, and far less citric fruit! 
The palate is so velvety  soft its like drinking satin! 

What more can I say This is the BEST BREWER in the world Im serious Im in Love with every one of the 4 brews Ive sampled!  No doubt Ill be cellaring a 4 pack of these 11.2oz bottles!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

3254,"2002-12-22",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2004 Blond beer with a medium creamy head. Very unusual aroma with a hint fruit. Not strong, just different. It is some spice  I feel I should know. The taste is hop, spice and fruit. Slightly sweet start with a bitter finish. An interesting beer.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
3254,"2002-12-13",3.9,"Big head, banana nose, slightly hazy orangish gold body. More fruit than spice, with some bite in the front of the mouth and a smooth finish. The 9% ABV isnt very noticeable.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
3254,"2002-11-24",3.9,"Stewed apple with spices and a touch of banana in the flavour.  Not as bitter/dry as many other tripels but the difference is what makes this such a good beer.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
3254,"2002-11-22",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2003 Re-rate, 1/25/03.  Still has an amazing nose, but the taste is very, very good in my second sample.  Very spicy and zippy.  Finish hangs around, nice, tasty, sugary ending to this brew.  Original rating:  Wondrous nose, spicy and fruity.  Flavor starts quite nice, plenty of banana and zippiness, but the finish sort of disappears.  Very dry, doesn't have any ending zing.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"

3254,"2002-09-22",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2008 Malty, raisinny aroma. Sweet, malty, raisinny, peppery taste. Long peppery bitter finish. From the bottle it has a flowery, honeyish aroma. Tap: unfiltered. Cafe Morshuis Albergen. Lemonaroma, initial lemon and vanilla flavor. After that loads of hops. Strong long lasting hoppy aftertaste. The 9% ABV is not noticed at all. Pity the beer was served too cold.
Bottle, 3 years old: Vinous aroma with remaining flowery hops and orange. Fusel alcohols in the flavor, that is becoming like old brandy. Vinous, notes of sherry. Alcoholic, but still satisfyingly balanced. Nice!","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
3254,"2002-09-10",3.5,"after the initial shock of the bad vodka fumes emanating from my glass, i liked this one. tastes uncannily like satay chicken. VERy coriander heavy, quite salty and a little bit tart. soft textured.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
3254,"2002-09-05",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2015 Rerate: Bottle from Mitra Bunnik, BB Febr 2017, large sample. Clear golden color, huge rocky slight off-white head. Aroma is quite sweet for a triple, lots of orange peel, slight coriander, slight peppery yeast. Soft bitterness in taste, again lots of orange peel, quite some sweetness. Actually getting close to Karmeliet Tripel with its loads of orange peel and being on the fruity sweet side for a tripel. Silly I havent tried this one before a lot as Im a huge fan of Karmeliet. Lovely stuff. Upgrading to 3.9.
Original rate from 2002: Decent triple by Brouwerij het Anker, though nothing special. Tasted like the Triple Toison dOr, also from Het Anker. 3.4","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
3254,"2002-08-18",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2015 750mL bottle (April 13, 2015 bottling).

Head is initially large, frothy, white, fully lasting.
Body is hazy medium yellow, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a strong note of coriander, other notes of gum, dried pineapple.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Beautiful appearance, nice flavor balance and mouthfeel, but just too much coriander in the nose...its like Tripel Karmeliet in that regard. This would probably be a 4+ tripel if it was unspiced.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3254,"2002-07-20",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2003 Pretty strong. The alcohol is very conspicuous. It reminds me very much of the Bornem Triple. Maybe this is a touch more elegant.","Copenhagen K, DENMARK","Mads Langtved"
3254,"2002-07-06",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2014 Potent coriander and a thick floral bouquet serve as a bed for some light herbs and cantaloupAn alcohol whip lashes in tandem with some hop bitternessA Tripel on the sweet side of things, but then again that is to be expected from these masters of spice and sugars","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
3254,"2002-06-12",4.2,"Faintly hazy gold orange with smallish short lasting yellow head. Luscious fruity hops, spices and honey, with some candy malt aroma. Medium -large body.

straw gold colour, white bubbly head that left some dense lacing.
