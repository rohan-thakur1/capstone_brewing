673,"2017-03-19",4.4,"Label claims 4 months of oak aging.  Small, fast gone yellow head over hazy ruby-chestnut beer. Extremely complex nose with honey, dark malts, alcohol, wine, old barrels, roses, bit of roast, liqueur, and fleeting hint of New World hops. Fantastic balance between sweet portlike wine notes, light bitterish roast and faint fruity acidity, vinous. Diverse fruitesters as banana, plums, red grapes and strawberries steeped in alcohol. Caramel cookies, tannines, black tea. Moderate but present alcoholwarming; feels better carbonated than it looks. Slightly burning MF, rich, voluptuous, well-bodied. Absolutely impressive ale.

Le tout dans une enveloppe mielleuse et où les effluves de chêne se dégagent tranquillement sans pour autant prendre trop de place.

Fond alcoolisé mais ce nest aucunement désagréable. Finale plus amère de pelures de raisins et de bois. Texture moyennement onctueuse et corps très rond. Fine et faible carbonatation.

Full aroma, replete with notes of whiskey, vanilla, and earthy/woody undertones.  Strong oak presence in the flavor, really dominates and in a way stifles the complexity of the brew, although nonetheless makes for a very enjoyable experience.  Finishes on the sweet and boozy side with a lingering  woody character.  Even with the lower carbonation level, this is quite full bodied and borders on being syrupy on the palate.  Very nice.  The only downside is that this beer is not highly drinkable; I would recommend enjoying this in small quantities as it can become overwhelming rather quickly.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Lanchester"
673,"2011-04-16",3.8,"En bouteille de 750 ml. Au départ, belle apparence mais la mousse et leffervescence disparait trop rapidement. Les arômes qui en ressortent sont toutefois très plaisante. Le caramel, la prune sèchée, le miel, le chêne et les fleurs forment les effluves de ce bon liquide. Ses points moins forts sont en lien avec le manque deffervescence mais ses forces sont les arômes et les goûts. Bonne bière.","CANADA","legrosjf"
673,"2011-04-08",4.2,"Les notes de vanille, porto et miel sont très bien équilibré. Le caractère du chêne nest pas aussi évident que je laurais souhaité. La version originale est assurément une des meilleures bières brassées au Québec alors je suis un peu déçu. Elle gagnerait à être vieilli. Ça reste une excellente bière doccasion.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"

673,"2010-12-27",4.4,"2010 edition. Oak-aged 4 months. Hazy dark amber / ruby with a medium creamy beige head. Aroma is fantastic ! Bourbon, wood, caramel, honey, flower. Full body with lo carbonation. Woooo, this one is a hit, smooth in mouth, and soon you got some wood, bourbon, honey and caramel, some dark fruits too. Theres not that much finishing, but you can still taste some wood. Mmmmm I need more !","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","georgebrassin"

En bouche, une belle chaleur nous enveloppe. Notes dalcohol, de chêne, de miel et un peu de caramel. Très douce. Finale avec une légère amertume et toute en chaleur.

673,"2010-12-07",3.3,"Bottle: Poured a hazy dark burgundy color ale with an average size foamy head with good retention and limited lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with dry oak notes. Taste is more dominated by oak and light vinous notes then I was expecting. The sweet malty notes from the based beer are still perceptible. Body is surprisingly more thin then the based beer with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting but I wont seek again considering the price tag and the fact that the original beer is much better.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
673,"2010-11-27",3.4,"750 ml bottle. Frothy beige head over an opaque brown pour. Aroma of honey, vanilla, a bit of alcohol, some alcohol soaked fruits as well, its a real scent bomb. Taste is cloyingly sweet, honey and vanilla sweetness covers the entire mouth. Palate is decent for such a liquor-y beer. Its a good beer but oh so heavy, not a balanced product at all.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
673,"2010-10-29",3.5,"A lasting beige sheet stays atop the almost opaque deep brown hue. Full-on honey nose with more than a touch of wax that, when warm, veers toward plastic, but when cooler, feels more natural, more biscuity, graham cookies reminding and almost oaty. Frankly, its 3-month oak sojourn did not add much besides a lazy touch of oak and even more vanilla. Still extremely sweet like the original, but rich enough with bready, toasty, mildly earthy, almost roasty hints to be a captivating sipper. Round on the palate, but certainly not thick and keeping a fair amount of carbonation for a beer of its type. Good stuff, but at 19$ a pop when I can get the regular at half the price, all volume proportions kept, its pretty much a rip-off.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
673,"2010-10-27",4.3,"This beer is just plain ridiculous.
Aroma isnt hugely different from the original Mackroken Flower, slight tones of oak added to the alcohol, sweetness. All malt.
The flavour is where this beer comes into its own. Intense oak paired with sweet biscuity/bready, and some sweetness in part from the honey added.
Super duper","Ontario, CANADA","strowlands8"

673,"2010-10-12",3.9,"17,99$ for a 750 ml bottle at BDF, released in 2010, aged for 4 months, claims the label.  I have been a little disappointed about their regular version but this one is quite better to me.  Pretty light brown translucid color, no head, just a few lacings.  Obvious whiskey in the aroma, with a lot of vanilla and discreet caramel-like sweetness.  The taste goes with the aromas, with a whiskey touch that is very present but not too aggressive either, shattering the powerful sweetness usually in this brew in its basic form.  Also, notes of figs, dates and dried berries are present.  The hoppiness is not easily distinguishable, because of the notes and warmth of the alchool, and the aftertaste is also quite alchoolic.  So, while not so agressive, the barrel-aging effect is thoroughly dominant for sure.  Very pleasant, well-done and clearly enjoyable, but it is an extremely boozy sipper.","Terrebonne, Quebec, CANADA","bedainedebiere"

Appearance : Dark mahogany with a small creamy head.

Aroma : Some wood and honey with some bitter hops. Hints of dark fruits.

Taste : Woody and very dry with some honey. Some more honey on the finish.

Overall : Interesting complexity added by the barrel ageing. Nice woody profile. Im not a huge fan of the regular Bilboquet Mac but I think it got better with the barrel ageing. Thanks Denis !","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
