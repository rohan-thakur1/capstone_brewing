1739,"2016-03-27",4.0,"Bottle, consumed in August 2014: Deep russet in color. Persistent off-white foam. Spellbinding aromas of vanilla toffee, smoke, poundcake, creamed coffee, milk chocolate, and licorice-y Spalter. Soft and creamy carbonation. Extraordinarily juicy, fat and finely polished malt exhibits rich melanoidins which massage and caress the tongue. Quite beautifully textured and notably pure malt character. Succulent tropical fruit esters join an explosive red plum flesh sweetness which causes the lips to smack. Silky layers of coffee-infused vanilla cake and toffee sparkle in the immaculately clean finish. A spectacular display of vivid malt, teeming with mouthwatering melanoidins. The lower alcohol combined with super clean fermentation makes this so much fun to throw back in large gulps. World class lager!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1739,"2015-04-01",3.7,"Bottle at the brewery. Pretty orange-brown color. Really nise rounded malt nose, caramel. Good use of hops, some orange and then a prickly finish. Light and crisp, some apricots. Good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1739,"2014-10-25",3.4,"Freshly made taster, 4.7 % abv, on a visit to the brewery. Solid white head to a cloudy dark apricot coloured body. Inviting malt-fruity aroma. Fresh and dried fruits in a well-blended flavour profile. Fruit hoppy ending, semi-dry. Medium bodied. Likable (Schnaid, Hallerndoft 11.10.2014).","Tromsø, NORWAY","Rune"

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Incredibly alluring nose, but the mouth experience didnt quite live up to its promise...doesnt have the usual silky mouthfeel. And yet still an excellent beer overall. Had a hard time competing with the other stuff Andy brought out that night in terms of complete drinking pleasure, but still every time I went to sniff the glass of this one I was amazed at the nose.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

1739,"2013-01-16",2.3,"Wässrig dunkel wässriger Antrunk. Etwas würziger werdend, trocken, laff. Wenig aromatischer Abgang. 10/7/8/7//7","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"
1739,"2012-09-29",3.7,"29/09/2012 Ma che siete venuti a fà (tap). Bruna, abbastanza limpida, riflessi  color miele di castagno, schiuma biancastra porca, morbida, non molto abbondante, abbastanza persistente. Al naso sentori di malti tostati, caramello, leggera luppolatura. In bocca è dolciastra, caramellata, tostata, piacevolmente bilanciata sullamaro. Corpo leggero, piacevolmente ""watery"", carbonatazione corretta. Non sono certo un amante del genere, ma questa è la miglior dunkel mai bevuta, senza ombra di dubbio.","Rome, ITALY","Mortlach"
1739,"2012-06-30",4.5,"Tasted at the brewery with Andreas. hazy dark orange/brown appearance with a cream colored head. Incredibly uniquely spicy, nutmeg toasty, dark malty aroma.
