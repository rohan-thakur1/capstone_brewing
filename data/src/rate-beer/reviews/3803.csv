3803,"2017-05-20",4.3,"750 ml bottle from phaleslu. Thanks! The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. Good head retention. The aroma has a dry red wine character along with a mellow low level funk. Soft acidity. The pinot noir shows through in the finish especially well. The pinot noir version is more well rounded and leas acidic than the base beer. Overall very good, but i lean toward the base beer as my preference.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

3803,"2016-12-29",4.4,"Shared bottle, poured a deep hazy orange gold colour with a white head. Big tannis grape notes upfront, citrus, grains, oak, and bitter grape skin, and yeasy. Taste is nowhere near as wine barrel forward as the base or the du ble, but the pinot oak barrels adds a ton of complexity.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
3803,"2016-12-27",3.8,"Thaks to Greg for this great gift you sent me n the mystery box! Dégustée à lapéro de notre Réveillon de Noël en accompagnement de foie gras et gravelax maison. Belle robe claire et translucide présentant des bulles jaillissant du fond de mon verre avec énergie. Arômes qui laissent présager une certaine aigreur en bouche. Je mattendais à une saison vineuse or je suis ailleurs. De la pelure de raisin rouge certes. Cette même pelure que lon retrouve dans le moût de raisin lors du processus de fermentation pour en arriver à faire du vin. Belle acidité au nez, mêlée à un funk grouillant de jeunes bactéries sactivant dans une barrique sablée. Importante aigreur en bouche pour moi qui souhaitait davantage de subtilités à cet égard. Jamais je nai senti les 7% dalcool car je crois que le corps riche et laigreur du liquide ont attiré toute mon attention. Pas mauvais, mais pas le coup de coeur que jespérais avoir non plus.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3803,"2016-10-13",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kellys Island Bottle Share on September 18. 750 mL bottle in a blind tasting. The pour is a darker golden yellow with a thick white head that falls down slowly to a thick cap, leaving a great lace behind. The aroma is really good. There is a sharp, tart yeast and grassy citrus happening. The pinot is pretty prevalent and the light oak adds a beautiful complexity. There is a hint of earthy spice on the finish as well. The flavor is even better. Its got the tartness, the fruitiness, the grassy yeastiness, and all without any hint of alcohol. The blend of fruits, yeast and grassiness, and the oak really meld so well together. The mouth feel is crisp and clean. There is a bright carbonation and a beautiful tart and pinot controlled aftertaste. This is just awesome. Son of a bitch.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3803,"2016-09-01",4.8,"Bottle from Greg (gregwilsonstl) -- a massive thanks for sending me this! This is one of the best things Ive ever put in my mouth. The Brett saison base beer is stunning, with a bit of spice and rustic earthiness from the saison yeast and a good but not overpowering funky complexity from the Brett, but its the barrel aging that takes this up to an epic level. The aging has smoothed and blended all of the flavors together, but its also introduced a pronounced, soft fruit flavor as well that made me think it had been aged on peaches or apricots. The closest analogy I can find is Hill Farmsteads Art. Like Art, this just nails the ""delicious Brett saison that I could drink a 750ml of every night with dinner and friends"" style, but refines it and perfects it from the barrel aging. One of the best beers Ive ever tried.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3803,"2016-08-04",4.1,"750 ml bottle to stemmed wine glass at SPC. Looks good; a transparent golden orange with eggshell head and lively carbonation. Smells good too; yeast, funk, and oak alongside a well-balanced vinous presence. Tastes like it smells with a pleasantly tart medium-bodied mouthfeel. Delicious.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3803,"2016-08-02",4.4,"750ml. Huge thanks to Matt for sharing. Color is a bit of a dingy yellow. Aroma is familiar Side Project, lemon, sweet candy sour. The flavors are intense lemon, stone fruit, white grape, lots of sour, relatively low acidity for how much flavor and sourness this packs. This beer is a masterpiece, I would love to drink this every day.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3803,"2016-08-01",4.5,"750 ml bottle. Pours a lightly cloudy marigold color with a finger of white head that lasts, smaller and rising on the sides to form a thicker ring than film. The aroma is very much like the standard Saison du Fermier, bright and lightly funky and tart, with lemon, stone fruit, bready malts, straw, white grapes, barnyard, and oak. The flavor here has more depth than the original, though, with a significant stone fruit character - to the degree that my wife asked, ""This is the peach version, right?"" Loads of peach and apricot stone fruit-like character, with grapes, sweet and bready malts, straw, bretty funk, lactic twinge, melon, and lemon. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a lightly tart, fruity, funky, and almost juicy mouthfeel in beautiful balance and harmony. And thats what really puts this one over the top; its gorgeous on the palate. Its hard not to drink a glass in like two minutes, its just that nice. This ones a stunner.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
