2831,"2016-02-24",3.0,"Decent lager beer with grassy aroma with a bit of pine. Quite mildly hopped compared to most american craft lagers / pilss, but very balanced hop profile. I suppose my can wasnt so fresh as aroma isnt powerful or fresh even when just poured to glass. Theres quite a good amount of bitterness but not mouth-drying levels.

Pretty vibrant golden pour with a healthy frothy white head and impressive retention and lacing; pretty much gorgeous in every way. Nose and flavor bring terrific cracker, white grapefruit flesh, orange rind, black pepper, lemongrass, and soft biscuit. Clean and dry, with bitterness assertive up front but not too aggressive on the finish. My only slightly negative critique would be there seems to be a half second on the palate of every sip that is a touch hollow or shallow; strange, but can be easily overlooked. An outstanding pilsener on the whole. Thanks again GT!!!","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Cascade arent distinguishable. Sharply bitter, lemon oiliness, off-dry malt softened by yeast. Medium body and chewy. No glaring off-notes, a faint bit of vitamin from the yeast, more dough than anything. Bitterness overwhelms the malt which gives it an IPA-like character.  In fact the overbearing bitterness and chewy malt (opposed to balanced bitterness and malt crispness) make it resemble ale more than lager.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2831,"2013-06-12",3.5,"Pours pale gold in color. Perfectly clear. Big white head. Excellent lacing and retention, particularly for the style. Good looking beer. The aroma is a mix of a sourdough-ish lager yeast flavor, gentle pale malt and grass/lemon/pine hops, relatively light. Not quite as hoppy as I expected. Its pretty subdued for a beer that has the name of a hop farm on the label. That said, the hop aroma is quite pleasant. Just a light mix of grass, citrus and pine. The taste is relatively dry. Theres some simple sweetness to it from the pale malt. Light grassy bitterness, particularly in the finish. A little more of that lager yeastiness. Its a refreshing, light beer with some solid flavor. Mouthfeel is light and fairly crisp. However, relative to the style, theres some definite body to the beer, just a light creaminess. Tasty enough, but it doesnt really stand out for me. Im a tad disappointed that the hops arent featured a bit more prominently and contribute a fairly middle of the road flavor. Still, its a good beer. I think my expectations were just a bit thrown off by the hop-focused label.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Origin: Texas Liquor Carlsbad Sample: 3x12oz Glass: Russian River Nonic Pint Price: $16/4 pack Date: 1/22/14 
Long: Thankfully these are now in cans- also thankfully found refrigerated at Texas Liquor. Beautiful pour into the glass grants you with a massive, rocky, white head with sheen hop oil retention. Perfect sheers of lacing. Nose is ridiculous inviting biscuit, orange marmalade, fresh southern sourdough biscuit, flashes of jam and yellow spiced apple. Taste is quite hoppy with perfect malt biscuit backbone- sharp Victory style Prima Pils aggressive bite with a softer finish. Calcium and chalk finale is secondary to a long, lactic finish with huge grassy hop power. Extremely quenching and sessionable, almost begging to be devoured in 4-5 sips. Absolutely outstanding for all lager lovers out there. Wow- if your name is ryan, MrChopin, 3fourths you need to try this beer. Sweet, sweet Jesus. Even if it is stupid expensive, I am going back for more right now.
