2969,"2014-03-17",2.5,"On tap @ Cask Pub & Kitchen. Really cloudy in the glass this and it has a lovely deep amber almost reddish colored body with a medium sized dense and lacing white top. It smells of red currants really. Some faint blackcurrants also here and a little bit of brett. Fruity and fresh definitely. It had a just above average carbonation level and a light oily mouthfeel. Much the same in the taste really. Fruity slightly acidic or perhaps a bit tart in youd like. Yeasty and somewhat sweet as well. Having a hard time identifying the genre here. It definitely has a strong alco sting also. No idea what Im drinking here, but its one of the weakest Ive had from these guys. 09.11.2013","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
