981,"2017-01-01",3.8,"On tap at DDC St-Jerome. Lets be honest. This beer used to be among the best and an incredible one. Few years ago, DDC had issues with the procurement of the yeast and it had never been the same when they reintroduced it with apparently a new recipe to accommodate a different yeast. I even had the impression they may have changed the recipe more than once in trying to achieve something satisfying. The beer is still good, but no longer the exceptional one it used to be few years ago!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","mozbee"

981,"2016-03-23",4.3,"BOD 3/15. Medium amber murky pour with suspended particulate matter from bottle conditioning. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Rich world class nose of fruity esters coupled with a light tart airiness. Peach, plum, pineapple, grape and orange coupled with a touch of pepper over a light Belgian base.

Light medium body with a smooth texture. World class carbonation with a nice effervescent middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish perfectly paired with the body.

The flavor profile is almost world class, but falls just a bit short due to a very light metallic note which arrives and lingers in the finish. Otherwise, this one is a very tasty Belgian ale with a world class fruity ester profile. Flavors from the nose all appear with some separation. The sweeter flavors appear after the middle corresponding with maximum balanced sweetness. The middle provides a very light rind bitterness. The finish is a slow fade of fruit and the light metallic note.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

981,"2015-02-19",4.2,"App: Golden yellow with a slight haziness, light soapy head that dies down to a thin film that stick around for a while. Its a pretty presentation, typical of a belgian ale.

Nose: Clove, pepper, a bit of banana, peach, apricot, white grapes, papaya, white bread very tropical and complex with a slight acidic edge reminiscent of a white wine with some added horse blanket, wet towel, barnyard funky notes that elevates this beer adding even more depth.

Taste: the grapefruit and citrus notes typical of an ipa are more present while still getting those yellow stone fruits and tropical notes. The spicy notes like pepper and clove arent hard to find aswell as that nice funkyness. The bitterness is pleasent. A bit of dankness, pine and grassyness in a dry finish.

This is a masterpiece of a beer with an unusual hop profile full of depth and complexity.
It is highly drinkable. Its the type of beer that you have a hard time putting down.
The malt are suddle in the background, leaving the floor for the hop and the yeast to shine in the spotlight. Very fresh, fruity and spicy while remaining very satisfying and complex. I cant believe i took so long before getting this one. Will buy again, highly recommanded.

Apparence: Jaune dorée vibrant. Moyennement voilé, avec mousse savonneuse qui se dissipe en un mince film qui demeure présent. Une belle biere sexy and classy.

Nez: Le clous, le poivre et un peu de banane. Les fruits sont a lhonneur avec des notes de pèche, abricots, raisin blanc, de papaye et de mis de pain blanc. Une certaine acidité et des notes funky de ferme, de couverture de cheval mouillée qui vient ajouté un agréable niveau de complexité.

En bouche: Les notes classique dagrumes tels que le pamplemousse, le citron et lorange sont plus présente toujours avec des notes de fruits jaunes a noyau qui la diffère de la plupart des IPA. Le clou et le poivre, ainsi que les notes funky sont présentes en bouche également. Une finale avec une amertume moyenne, herbacé avec un peu de sapinage résineux et une touche de ""dankness"".

On se croirait vraiment en Belgique si ça navait été de lépaisse mousse qui saffaisse très rapidement en un mince filme de surface.

This beer was recommendation made by a beer fanatic friend of mine and I thought Id give it a try to see if it was as impressive as she described it. Honestly, it was. Being a huge fan of Dieu du Ciel, I did have some expectations and as usual they met every single one of them. Lets begin:

Visually, the beer pours an hazy golden releasing a fair amount of micro carbonation. I got about three fingers of fluffy foam with awesome retention properties as you can appreciate on the picture I took moments after pouring it.

The nose is an interesting blend of flowers, honey, citrus and bready malts. The brew is very aromatic, but I didnt find it to be aggressive or excessively floral. The malts brought everything to an enjoyable equilibrium.

On the tongue, youre first hit with the citrus and the floral elements. Some honey paves the way to the finale and enhances the flavours to give a floral finish holding a moderate bitterness. I have to mention the brews exceptionnal density and silky/oily feel.

Overall a very nice product even for those unaquainted with the IPA. Its good without being too complex or too bold. A perfect match with zesty salads, strong cheeses (an old cheddar for instance) or your favorite spicy food. Cheers!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Beardbeerman"

T: Follow the nose. Sweet, fruity and spicy upfront. Notes of candy sugar, caramel malts, cinnamon, cloves, honey, earthy yeasts, peaches, white bread. Complex. Delicious. Finish is slightly hoppy bitter
M: Creamy molasses body. Medium carbonation. Sweet and spicy aftertaste

981,"2014-07-13",4.3,"Bière jaune orangée, bien voilée, très effervescente, et surmontée dun col blanc immaculée, moyennement large, mais très dense, très mousseux, qui colle sur les parois du verre, et qui semble éternel. Arômes de pain frais, pâtisserie, malt mielleux, léger sucre dorge, fruits du verger (pêche, poire, pomme) et levure belge. On décèle également certains effluves plus houblonnés en arrière-plan, mais difficile à cerner et à décrire. Ce houblon semble à la fois floral, poivré et herbacé. Beau nez bien agréable, très belle complexité, mais ça manque passablement dintensité cependant. En bouche, pétillement moyen-élevé sur la langue, breuvage bien mousseux, et très belle onctuosité, cest moelleux, soyeux et velouté au palais! Au goût, ça rejoint pas mal le nez avec du pain frais et de la pâtisserie, un léger sucré style miel et/ou sucre dorge, dabondants fruits du verger, et une levure belge discernable. Le houblon est quant à lui heureusement bien plus présent en bouche quau nez, et il est principalement herbacé et poivré avec également quelques accents de conifère. Lamertume est de faible à modérée. Bière heureusement bien plus intense en bouche quau nez, très belle complexité, très belle intégration des différentes saveurs entre elles, et très bel équilibre malt/houblon.

Derniere Volonte from Dieu du Ciel

My wife and I visited Dieu du Ciel in Montreal as part of our honeymoon. At the time they served 2 of the top 10 beers in the world.

This was not one of those. Actually never heard of this until I saw it at the LCBO.

Very hazy golden yellow pour with lacy head. Weak scent. Smelly like a beer. A hoppy beer but a beer. Holy fruity. Tastes nothing like the usual puckery grapefruit like bitterness of most pale ales.

Getting really tired of overbuilt beers and appreciating more and more the importance of body and character and nuance. The kind of thing usually found in beers that have a generations in the making maturity to the recipe (Like Ayinger Dunkel, for instance).

Been here a couple of times and only drank half litters of Carlsberg because this is really not the place where you would expect to find something like this  didnt even bother checking the menu before now. Borderline, cub-like atmosphere, loud jarring music, people getting drunk after work, swigging half-litters of Carlsberg, huge posters advertising said beer, lots of people out on the street, Champagne bottles popping, drunk people dancing on the tables etc. you get the picture. Their menu has a beers of the world selection which does have a few duds like USA is represented by Budweiser but also Sam Adams. Mexico by Corona  just leave out Mexico maybe? Germany by Bittburger but also more interesting Vitus. The rest of the countries is totally of the map & unexpected, Denmark is represented by Mikkeller, Netherlands by Emelisse & De Molen, Scotland by Brewdog, really impressive & hard to believe esp. since some of the beers on the menu I had never seen before in Belgium like this beer representing Canada. Which was also sold at the same price as Budweiser, namely 4.5 euro which seems like an exceptional price for this one. Congratulations to whoever made this beerlist.

Looks like BBF 2007. 5.9 % ABV. 341 ml. bottle @ office goodbye drink. Incredibly cellared. Fittingly called, the last wish. Everyone hated this one just as much as the other beers I tried but this was deemed the least terrible & one ex-colleague actually liked it & described it as a great beer. Somewhat hazy amber, head was not very big but very solid. Great hops, grapefruit, still incredible this is actually is here, great brett, fruity, spicy yeast, fruity, floral hops, very light esters, none of that banana & sweetness mentioned in the other reviews.

Nice aromas of yeast, Belgian spice and fruit esters. Real tantalizing.
The flavor is very much the same with a nice bittering effect in the finish. Im wondering what variety of hops they used here. It has grapefruit like tones. Maybe a bit grainy.

Very fragnant nose. Taste: Medium-light sweet, medium-light bitter, medium-light sour. Mostly flowery and soft, despite the elevated abv %. Not as citrusy as I expected.

981,"2011-10-27",3.7,"<br clear=""left"">I poured an 11.5oz bottle into an oversize wine glass.Appearance: Dark gold/orange hue; hazy but opaque if the yeast is added. Forms a large, Duvel-like frothy head which laces and retains very well.Smell: Sweet, light fruits and some farmhouse funk, coupled with subtle spice notes.Taste: Belgian pale ales or blondes or singles rarely wow me. Dieu Du Ciel Dernière Volonté didnt either, but unlike most it didnt let me down. Its much stronger and fruitier than your average non-Belgian made take on the style. It begins fairly juicy and refreshing with orange peel and juice-like flavor and taste. Theres a slight hop spice through the middle, although its not a very bitter beer per se. It ends with a kick of black pepper and spice and a very drying sensation. Its interesting how a beer can be both refreshing and dry at different stages of the swig. While not as big and bold as Duvel, this beer definitely isnt as mild and ho-hum as most Belgian pales. Its in that strange void that few beers occupy with genuine flavor and reserved intensity. Nothing about the palate is amazing or unique, but its definitely more than just satisfying. Mouthfeel: Thick, soft but fizzy. Relatively clean aftertaste with minor spice dryness.Drinkability: This is a bottle-conditioned, Belgian-style beer (probably brewed with Belgian yeast), so its no surprise Dieu Du Ciel Dernière Volonté is quite bubbly. Carbonation does get stuck in the throat, although theres not a whole lot of spice dancing on the tongue - just a quick pepper bite. The 6.5% ABV seems dead-on as it has enough flavor and weight to do the job, but not something youd want to session or make a meal out of.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Honey sweetness exists in perfect harmony with floral hops, tangy citrus and bright phenolics. The palate is prickly, yet full-bodied for the style.

OVERALL: Quite pleasant. Seemed to really get a discernable amount of green apple in aroma and taste. Subtle vinous barnyard taste; with similar notes on the nose as well, though to a lesser degree. Almost saison-like; or perhaps like a combination of a higher ABV saison, a wit, and a small portion of lambic.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"
981,"2011-02-09",4.2,"Light gold haze with a subtle spicy aroma. Theres bitterness along with a fruity tang that is really quite unique. Truth in advertising perhaps, as theres evidence of English and Belgian ales in this brew.

Lovely mouthfeel and a smooth finish. To describe it as a combination of ale types with some wheat beer touches doesnt really do it justice. A great beer from a truly remarkable brewery.","Ontario, CANADA","Beer Snob"

That disappeared after I got it in the glass, could be an anomaly. In the glass I smell a spicy peppery bready yeasty brew. Taste is yeasty peppery bready as well.

981,"2011-01-05",4.2,"Serving: 330 ml. bottle from Bruisin Ales. 
Aroma: The nose is spicy and fruity indeed with a powerful blast right out of the bottle.  I am sure the copious amount of carbonation helps things along.  A touch winey in the nose but with some Belgian yeast character and some sweetness.  Reminds me of a sweet German wine. 
Appearance: In pours a murky light brown with some gold and a large, frothy head of foam.  Lots of larger soapy bubbles.  Good head retention. 
Taste: The taste is much more mature and drier than the nose lets on.  Definite Belgian yeast characteristics but dry and fruity.  Nice apple and pear notes with a touch of spicy hops.  Very yeasty, but I didnt quite pick up all the florals they refer to. 
Palate: Light to medium in body with lots of carbonation leading to a dry and yeasty finish.  Smooth and enjoyable.
Overall: The ratings certainly do it justice as this brew is quite savory (except for the price tag).  Great subtlety and balance.  One of the best Belgians Ive had in quite some time.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Deep, fruity aroma... a sweet cocktail of cherries, peach, tangerine with a pleasing waft of alcohol as well as remnants of tea leaves, tree leaves and honey. The marriage of Belgium & England is well-played. Flavor leans towards the latter as the tongue is first met by the taste of an English IPA before it opens up to sweeter fruitiness, a cheesish yeastiness and, once again, a sweet drop of honey. Lightly astringent yet the flavors last with a complex sweet-yet-bitter spiciness.

Tons of sloppy sticky lacing. Up front aroma with a very interesting Belgian yeast spice and crazy fruity citrus and resin hops that meld into an amazingly unique aroma. Cloves and lemon and apricots. The taste is also very good making this amazingly easy to suck back. Just as you are about to get a dose of yummy yeast (.25 seconds in) an avalanche of hops crushes and buries the crummy red Datsun you are driving on the way home from a Bikram Yoga class. Resin, apricots, oranges and lemons were the culprits. Add in the spicy yeast, a hint of anise and biscuit after things quiet down - by the way, those hops did not ruin this interesting mix.

Smell: Lots of yeast and citrus. The smell is quite Belgian but it also reminds me of many of the Unibroue Belgian Style brews. Sweet pale malts, spicy but soft yeast, and lots of orange goodness. Intoxicating smell!

Taste: Grain up front, yeast in the middle, and some hop bitterness in the finish. Some floral qualities from the yeast, some orange and lemon qualities and hop bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Fairly thin with a decent amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Pretty good due to the mouthfeel.

S- Nose is soft and floral hops, peppery spice. and sweet yeast are detectable with a light scent of fruits too. Very nice.

T- Dry apple, pear, and citrus upfront with a soft,smooth, yeasty backbone. Bitter floral hops and a good dose of peppery spice kick in for the finish and do not overpower what was already present. Soft hop bitterness and all the characteristics mentioned before linger on the back of the palate long after each swallow.

O- Well here you have it. I havent sampled much from this style considering we like our big beers-and BSPA is my favorite style. The other pale Abbey Ales I have tried dont measure up to this one though. This has everything I like about BSPAs and Tripels w/o as much Alcohol...therefore perfect drinkability.

Here is a rerate of this stuff that I accidentally put in w/ the barrel aged version. After reading the commercial description, my rating speculates as to what the barrel aging added to what ultimately was a beer w/ no barrel aging. Oh well. My total score came out exactly the same and to my credit, I did note vanilla notes in the original rating. Here goes: I am not certain but Im pretty sure this is the first beer Ive had that was aged in wine barrels. It is the only one I remember anyway. (And I pretty much have to remember it as Im drinking it right now.) Its a decent cloudy orange color but the head is short lived and consists of large, soapy bubbles rather than my preferred, tight knit creamy head. The nose is mild, Belgian in character, w/ a sort of bitter oak and vanilla note in the background. This oaken note becomes stands out much more once the beer is tasted and is what I presume the pinot noir barrel adds. Its quite nice w/ good depth of flavor. The texture is light but still somewhat creamy w/ the carbonation prickling only faintly. This is a very well done beer in which the barrel character really compliments rather than dominates.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

981,"2009-09-28",4.1,"Enjoyed from an 11.2oz bottle in an elongated tulip glass.  The beer pours a medium yellow to lightish golden color with a fluffy white head.  The nose gives characters that seem to place the beer broadly within the style of a Belgian Blonde ale.  This is confirmed by the abv.  Given this, my benchmark for comparison was Leffe.  This beer surpasses the aforementioned in every conceivable way.

The nose is tremendously complex, showing first some European hop character, followed by a deep and rich malt note (pilsner + munich + aromatic + a touch of special ""B""?), followed by yeast-derived esters that gives notes of banana, pear, and a bit of apple.

The palate backs up the down payment afforded by the beers aromas.  A tremendous erray of malt-derived flavors greets the drinker in the approach.  The beer almost tastes like a great English ESB made with continental malts and yeast.  Tremendous.

Overall, this redefines the style for me.  Worth seeking out and paying nearly any price for.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

981,"2008-09-17",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2010 This is pretty well carbonated as a regular pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a four finger thick, pale, off-white colored head.  The head is quite fluffy and creates ample lacing and a nice rocky surface as it slowly recedes.  The beer is an amber tinged gold color, but shows a lightly hazy, orange-gold hue when held up to the light.  The aroma, noticeable as I visually inspect this beer, smells of grassy hops.  A closer inspection yields aromas of orange zest, ginger, piquant white pepper and an herbal grassy note.  As I begin to notice the hops a bit more some aromas of tropical fruit (lychee, apricot) become more noticeable and compete equally with the herbal and grassy notes.  Towards the finish grassy grain notes, dusty crushed pale malt aromas and some crushed cracker notes become noticeable.  I really like the combination of vibrant hop aromatics and spicy yeast character and this beer definitely achieves that nicely.

Lightly sweet grain character mixes with the hops to produce some aromatic honey-like flavors.  The hop character at first contributes flavors of lychee, apricot and orange zest, but then towards the middle and into the finish picks up some herbal notes of lemon verbena, pine and a light, green grassy note, all the while retaining a lingering hop fruitiness.  The bitterness, for all of the hop character is fairly light; in fact there is more astringent, fresh green hop character in the finish than there is clean, biting bitterness.  This has a certain heft to it that is lightly viscous and of a light medium body; this still manages to be quite a bit more quaffable than the body might suggest (perhaps the hop character makes this more drinkable).  Fermentation character, while secondary to the hop character, still plays a significant role with flavors of clove, musty crushed pale malt, piquant-slightly-woody pepper, young ginger (accented by the hops) and some sharp phenolics that are more than clove but not quite into the cured plastic category.

My second pour sees an increase in a clean bitterness that is quite ample and seems accentuated by the zippy carbonation.  This is quite a tasty beer and I am really wishing this was a 750ml bottle that I was enjoying.  I definitely wish I had more of this beer as I am definitely a sucker for beers like this.

981,"2008-08-03",4.0,"11.5oz bottle. Pours deep yellow gold - cloudy with a medium-sized, fluffy, white head that quickly dissipates into a very thin, spotted, persistent ring of foam. The aroma is very Belgian: grassy hops, bready/doughy malt aroma, sweet and fruity esters, some bitter citrus elements (lemon zest, grapefruit rind), and some spiciness (pepper and coriander). The flavor starts very dry with a nice, big hop flavor and bitterness combined with subtle citrus - and an almost tartness. The beer remains dry and complexly bitter and earthy throughout. There is a subtle fruit ester note at mid-palate and some dry, toasted bread notes - but the malts are a bit subdued and there is almost no residual sweetness. Mid-tongue is bitter with earthy hops and an interesting but somewhat mild yeastiness - doughy and spicy. The finish is very dry and gives a subtle nod to a dry champagne. Another nod to champagne is the elegant and vigorous level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is very crisp with bubbles and the body is light (though swirling it in the mouth to release the CO2 reveals a slightly thicker and more slippery texture that is medium in body). Though the beer is very dry with a firm bitterness, the aftertaste reveals a nice graininess that tastes like pale malts with an ever-so-slight sweetness. Overall, a very interesting beer that is well constructed and very well suited for the warm weather.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Crisp medium body, almost too carbonated, with loads of wheat and lemon/orange peel.  Very, very dry and spicy, slightly peppery with coriander and alcohol heat, along with some sort of exotic guarana/guava/mango fruit notes coming from either the yeast or the hops.

A nice bitter, spicey, herbal hop note leads the charge, followed quickly by a pleasant citrus note coupled with a mild sweetness. The whole thing ends up rolling towards the hops toward the end.

Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting.

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Tainted by overly aggressive hops of the wrong variety, which threatens to clobber whats Belgian about it.  Pity, because otherwise its a solid beer.  I would expect this sort of treatment from a west coast American brewer, but DDC?  Odd.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

981,"2008-02-22",4.1,"Bottle date 12/07

Pours hazy, pale gold, with a merange-like head of eggshell white.
The dense foam took several minutes before receding to a raised cone in the center.
Exceptional lacework throughout the glass, with ring after ring of whipped foam.
Aromatics are belgianesqe and somewhat hoppy.
Cloves, mint gum, and lemon zest, along with some peppery dryness.
The mouthfeel is light and well carbonated,
dry and crisp.
The pallet has very light malt, with a firm, dry bitterness, and a sligtly tart citric bite.
Alcohol is somewhat warming and does not detract.
Finishes bone dry with more lemon zest.
Very quenching and quaffable.

Of the six Dieu Du Ciels Ive tried recently, this one was far better than all but the Peche Mortel.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"
981,"2008-02-14",3.9,"341 mL bottle from Jovi, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass.
App.:  Hazy golden with a large off-white head.
  
Aroma:  Beautiful green, resinous, leafy, floral hops (yum!), a healthy dose of coriander behind that, honey and yeast, 
  
Palate:  Medium body, full effervescence that is a bit sharp in spots.
  
Flav.:  The burst of resinous, leafy, floral hops is followed by a soothing malt/honey/yeast feeling that is then followed by lemony coriander; on swallowing, there is admirable bitterness;  the beer is off-dry and there is no alcohol anywhere, dough and bread crust linger.

I love it.  Belgian-inspiration with aggressive hopping makes for a lovely beer.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
981,"2008-02-13",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2008 Hazy orange with a large head that lasts and coats the glass. Aroma is coriander, pepper, yeast, somewhat fruity. Medium bodied, high carbonation that somehow works. Typical flavors with high carbonation, kinda interesting. Nice appearance though.

981,"2008-02-07",2.9,"Bière blonde aux reflets ternes. Laisse un col moyen et persistant de couleur ivoire.
Parfum plutôt houblonné : aux notes dagrumes, de résine, dencens, de cuir et de lavande. Au premier abord, une note florale et savonneuse agaçante assaille le palais. Le goût par la suite est plus équilibré avec les agrumes et les résines. Il y a bien un petit goût de cuir, ce qui est un peu moins élégant. Larrière-goût est mieux : notes houblonnées, déthers et de levures. La bouche est mousseuse, ce qui nestompe pas les impressions savonneuses (désolé dinsister).
Jai bien apprécié les saveurs résineuses et dagrumes, elle rappelait une IPA avec une bonne dose de levures. Ce nest pas la bière que je demanderais comme « dernière volonté ».","gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Brouwser"

981,"2008-01-26",3.1,"Appearance: Pours a clear, yellow-orange body with a large, fizzy white head.

Smell: All the components of the aroma are certainly clear and distinct - banana, citrus, coriander, dough.

Taste: Banana bread dough mixture. Citric and exceptionally spicy throughout. Malts and even some sugary sweetness try to emerge but soon fade back into the spice. Bitter, hoppy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Sharp, prickly carbonation.

Drinkability: In an attempt to fit in more around these parts, Ive given more and more Belgian ales a try. Sadly, though, this one failed to win me over.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

981,"2008-01-18",3.8,"Pours a mostly clear, very lightly hazy golden blond color.  A small, foamy, densely packed head shows excellent retention and leaves some nice, patchy lacing behind on the glass.  The aroma is dry and crisp, with a surprising hoppy punch.  Soft citrus overtones meet a toasted bready, yeasty malt base, followed by pungent and spicy floral hops.  The flavor is equally complex, with the floral dry hopping obviously adding alot to the brew.  The citrus defines itself as a light orange and lemon chiffon blend, while the hops finish ultra-dry and bitter.  I swear I even pick up some brett in this, though Im not sure if that is the intention.  Medium-full, well carbonated mouthfeel.  Id like to know the IBU measure on this one, as it is indeed surprisingly hoppy.  Solid brew.  Really well done for a delicate, light Belgian style.  I could definitely go for a few of these on a hot Florida day.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Clear golden amber with a 1 1/2 finger bone white head, good retention.  Aroma has definite Belgian characteristics--yeast, pear, apple--with some peppery notes and stale herbal hops.  Digging deeper there are notes of banana and earth.  Flavor had plenty of fruit again (with some added lemon zest) with the same peppery and hop dryness that I imagined itd have.  Not much sweetness to be had as far as I could tell.  Flavor did add an light acidic tang almost in the finish.  Semi-dry, earthy bitter (3 out of 10) finish.

Taste of spice and yeast, sweet malt with that almost weird green hop overlay - not balanced at all, and that hurts the overall taste.

981,"2006-06-12",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2009 In short: A very hoppy (juicy floral hops) Belgian Blonde Ale.  Original and very good.
How: Bottle 330ml, fresh (many of them, 12+).  Also many times on tap at the pub (12+ times)
The look: Partly cloudy light golden body with a large white head
In long: Very enticing nose of honeyed flowers.  Honey and petunias is what comes to my mind.  Taste is rather sweet with sugary honey flavour and texture.  Very yeasty but with only mild fruity notes of peaches and mangos.  Hopping takes a lot of room.  Not a lot of bitterness but instead very very juicy hop flavour. A little foresty not but overall very floral.  A short but sharp dry bitterness in the after-taste surprises after each sip.  A very atypical Belgian Ale.  Would also be atypical in any other style.  My own Dernière Volonté (Last Will) is that they throw in some dry and bitter hops and well have a masterpiece.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Fresh green hops greet the nose immediately backed by a brace of white sugar.  Some faint touches of yeast, but its passing.

981,"2004-06-09",4.0,"(Draught) Mondial de la Bière 2004. Thin, white head and a clear gold body. Nose is spicy, cascade hops... GORGEOUS! Very spicy, hoppy as hell. The finish is a bitter hoppiness. An excellent Belgian Ale.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
981,"2004-06-08",3.5,"Light golden in colour, small white head.  Aroma was of mild spices, earth and hops.  Flavour was spicey, some pepper, hops, some lemons.  Medium body, mild carbonation.  Finishes slightly dry and hoppy.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"

981,"2004-06-07",3.7,"Golden in color with a small white head. Hoppy aroma. Sweet malts,hoppy and fruity flavor.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
981,"2004-06-07",4.1,"Fruity, sweet malt aroma supports strong flowery, pine-like, woody hop nose. Slightly hazy, depp golden, caramel coloured body with two finger white head that lasts nicely. Strong hops subsumed with fruity sweet malts beneath. Pleasant lasting bitterness. Body is medium with good carbonation. Its definitely a tripel from the fruity sweetness, but the huge hops add an exciting twist. Very drinkable. On tap at the brewpub (sampled also at Mondial 2004).","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
981,"2004-06-06",3.6,"Draft. Pale slightly hazy golden yellow with a nice white head. Interesting hoppy notes over top of the sweet alcoholic aromas Id expect from a triple.  Some peppery spicey notes in the aroma become more prominent in the flavour. Mouthfeel is on the light side. Mondiale 2T.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
981,"2004-06-04",4.0,"Clear straw golden body with gentle off-white head. Aroma is very piney, mineralic with grassy and leafy green hop tones. Spicy mint and lemongrass fruitiness (pears, oranges). Superb balance between dry-hopping and the belgian ale serving as fundation. Loads of grassy hops, lemon, mild apples and white grapefruit, yeasty. Delicate balance imo. Body could be bigger though, but the moderately high carbonation fits well. Coating aftertaste, bitter, sprucey. Very interesting.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
981,"2004-06-04",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2010 (October 2007, bottled batch): The dry-hopped aroma is not as prominent as some batches Ive tasted at the brewpub, but the spicy hop edges tickle all the way to the finish. The head on this one never dies, the body is rich and soothing for this gravity, the mouthfeel is authentically Belgian, and the flavor profile is smooth and balanced. This is as professional as it gets, folks. A top notch Belgian Ale which wont wow because of its idiosyncracies, but which cannot be objectively criticized.

(April 2006 batch): Aromas gotten a lot spicier, lots of ginger fruitiness, which works well with the dry hoppiness...This is becoming a unique Belgian ale with a funky Thai twist!

(January 2005 batch): Dry-hopping is still prevalent but much more amicable...Flavors are extremely well-blended, and malt, hops and spiciness all converge for a beautiful rendition of a North American Single Abbey Ale...Top notch stuff and, in this form, maybe my favorite Belgian they make...

(First try) : Gargantuan dry-hopped nose, grassy marine life à la Quintessence, a tad too intense for now, covering multiple pale fruit underneath...Honey malt sweetness surges to balance it all out, but the fresh hops still dominate...A frail body entices the tongue to take advantage of it, with multiple pleasurable gulps, all intense in flavor.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
981,"2004-06-02",3.5,"5th beer of the 2004 Montreal Mondiale. Clear yellow, medium head. Ok, the aroma and the flavour are both quite a lot like pot, before its smoked, it must be the dry-hopping, something I dont think I have yet to have in a beer. Im not sure if I really like this, but it is interesting.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","nickchalk"
