4213,"2016-10-03",3.0,"Poured from a bottle that has to be at least 5 years old; I kind of forgot about it int he cellar. Oops. 
Aroma is sweet cherry with some, musty, old newspaper notes of oxidation. Aroma reminds me a lot of cherry Ludens, but the age adds some oxidation. Some light malt notes. 
Pours a murky, dull red with some brown hues and a small, fairly thin, slightly tan head that recedes quickly to the edges where a small, thin film lingers for a bit. Faint lacing and no legs. 
Flavor is very sweet with a definite cherry throat lozenge character to it. Some much sweet cherry notes that come across as almost artificial. Some light malt notes with a bot of caramel and some honey. Light toasted bread notes. Some oxidation showing up as old newspapers and wet cardboard. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, the age didnt help this beer and only added an oxidation note. Im not sure anything could help this beer though as it tastes and smells like the cherry throat lozenges that toe the line between medicine and candy.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

The Belgian in this is really clean, didnt get much other character and couldnt detect hallertau hops much but maybe they just enhance it.

4213,"2016-06-28",3.8,"One of the great classics of the American craft beer revolution, gift from Ster who brought it all the way from Wisconsin for me, which I am very grateful for; shared with her and other people at Belgium Chimipalooza. Thick, creamy, off-pinkish head over a hazy, deep cherry-red beer with beautiful ruby glow. Aroma of sweet cherry candy and cherry jam, candied lemon, caramel, lime zest, vanilla, grape peel, ripe blackberry, stewed apple, fruit pie. Sweet, initially almost candyish but still not cloying cherry flavour, very rich like a cherry pie and cherry jam, residual sugars, soft bready wheat base, thin but effective lemony sourish sting peeping up in the middle and lasting till the end, balancing the cherry pie sweetness; spritzy body, sweet and sourish finish, full and not too sticky. Totally different from what I had expected, even reminded me a bit of Lindemans Kriek at a certain moment, but altogether very different from the sweetened cherry lambics at the same time, more bready, more moelleux and - most importantly - much more genuinely fruit-like.

Tastes like cherry pie filling, with spices (cinnamon) and all, although I dont think those ingredients are actually in the beer.

4213,"2015-07-02",4.0,"Big thanks, again, to my friend John. A native Wisconsinite who now calls Louisville home, and a true friend. Aroma: Pure cherry juice; low to moderate sweetness; very light tartness (surprising for a beer made with tart Montmorency cherries!); subtle hints of mint and chocolate. Appearance: As advertised, a ruby red pour with slight haze; carbonation is pretty soft and supports a small, bubbly ring of head. Flavor: Matches the nose; still very much a somewhat sweet, juicy cherry experience. You do notice a little more oak at play than in the nose. Towards the finish, there is a very subtle hint of hops that have a slight drying effect, but not enough to quench the sweetness entirely. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, lingering finish. Overall: Really good stuff, but I did enjoy Serendipity quite a bit more.

Finish: A mix on lingering chocolate and cherry. 
Overall: Top notch fruit beer with a wonderful balance of cherry and chocolate components. Acidity and high carbonation would make this angriest dessert beer.","","TH28"

Flavor is the same way, just a huge orgy of cherries hammer fucking every single nook & cranny in your oral orifice. Lightly tart & acidic up front & in the finish with a long, drawn out sweetness that bridges the gap in between. The somewhat abrupt, zesty finish ensures that the sweetness of the beer doesnt wear you down too quickly.

Nice light breads over tart cherries. The yeast profile throughout these New Glarus fruited beers are signature. Whatever is in the hills of Wisconsin, it lends itself well to these brews! It tastes like cherry SweeTarts! A nice, light body along with bright carbonation allows flavor to explode across the palate. Light floral hops, light breads...such a harmony. No cloying sweetness, no puckering tartness....this beer is just right. World class!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

Mouthfeel is juicy, litterally like drinking some sweetened fruit juice from the store. Blah. Carbonation was prickly. Not sure where I stand on this one, this was way too sweet and artificial. Maybe we got a bad bottle? Bad batch with a less than usual attenuation/fermentation problems?

A: Pours a great ruby with pinkish hues around the edges when held up to the light. A nice light pink head forms with a vigorous pour, about 1.5 finger but recedes quickly. No real lace to speak of but a nice ring follows the brew down the glass. 

S: Candied cherries up front with a slight tartness. Has a slight medicinal smell but in a good way. Has some hops to it that peak in around the cherrys and nice barley to smooth it out. 

T: Hello cherries, so nice to finally meet you! The cherries are extremely sweet and candied in nature, almost like a cherry lollipop. The taste transforms into slight bitterness at the end, but its very mild. 

M: Medium bodied with a great carbonation. Coats the palate with a thinly veiled sweet cherry. A little sticky. 

O: I normally do not like fruit beers or sweet tasting beers, but this guy really struck a chord with me. I wouldnt be able to drink it on a regular basis, but it was nice to have after a good dinner. Im interested to see how the raspberry tart Ive got in the fridge compares.

Served in a champagne flute, this renowned beer appears remarkably similar to cherry juice. The color is a beautiful, vibrant ruby hue. There is about an inch of head that fades over a few moments.

The smell, which is easily detectable from a few feet away, is reminiscent of cherry pie, with the cherries being predominantly of the sweet variety.

The taste is exactly what the aroma would indicate. Cherry pie, cherry juice, cherry cobbler, cherry soda - you name it. This beer is all about the cherries.

At a mere 4% abv, the alcohol is an afterthought. The feel is pretty good, though the beer is intensely sweet.

4213,"2012-02-23",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 6/12/2010.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a wine glass. 

Out of the bottle Belgian Red has a slightly opaque bright ruby red color with a 2 cm off-white head. It fades somewhat quickly but still leaves a bit of sticky lace on the glass. Very full color.

Tart cherries dominate the aroma. A little bit sweet as well.

There are strong tart cherry notes all the way through. Some sweetness sneaks in more and more as it warms, but cherry is in control the entire time. Nothing about this is incredibly complex, but it represents cherries very well without anything synthetic tasting or out of place.

Smooth and light on the tongue. Bubbly carbonation. Sweetness leaves the lips a bit sticky.

This is not the kind of beer I would normally think about sessioning, but it has such a great balance of sweet and (mostly) tart cherry flavor that this could be a surprise addition to my regular stash.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Pleasingly both sweet and tart and just a huge treat-tastes like summer.  Just awesome.

4213,"2011-10-31",4.8,"This beer completely blows me away every time I try it.  It doesnt score near perfect in my books based on depth of complexity necessarily, but more so for the sheer pleasure I get from every sip.  I actually cant get enough of this beer.  When poured out, it possesses a deep, vibrant ruby color that makes you smell cherries before you even put your nose to the glass.  A rocky, billowing head sits atop this beer like a crown and follows it fully the whole way to the bottom.  On the nose, the beer gushes forth with wave after wave of deep, juicy cherry.  The fruit and the malts together give the cherries a sort of warm, bready character in the nose and remind me of someone leaving a freshly baked cherry pie out to cool on the windowsill.  On the palate, the beer is fresh and creamy, with a winelike finesse to it thats almost like a vinaigrette.  The cherries come in again in a gooey, warm, malty way thats not too rich or too cloying.  The winelike, slightly sour quality really makes itself known and works perfectly with the dark cherry character.  A perfect, lively carbonation just makes this ultimate beer harmony.  Overall, this is one of the classiest beers I have ever had.  I always wish it were easier to find so I could drink it all the time.","Pennsylvania, USA","bosendorfer"

The flavor is largely just more of the same, with a one-dimensional sweet cherry juice character. I dont get any interplay between the fruit and the grains, no balance from the hops, and no earthy/woodsy character that would be expected from the oak aging.

It reminds me of the sour cherries my grandparents grew on the farm I grew up on in rural Ohio, but the scent also has a Christmas-spice element to it (definitely cinnamon) that reminds me of potpourri.  The flavor is also spectacular.  Of course, the cherries this is brewed with dominate the flavor, with only a slight but refreshing sourness.  The freshness of this beer is remarkable.  It tastes like it was made of fresh, muddled cherries.  The beer also has a great mouthfeel, which you dont get from some fruit beers.

Smell: Like cherries almost like a halls but alluring, not so much like medicine, but like a cherry soda. 


Tastes: Very tart, lots of cherry, and sweet. Tart sticks to your lips and gentle bitterness left on the back of tongue.


Body: Little carbonation but balances well with the tart. The sweetness is a little more then I care for but is refreshingly different then most that try to capture the sweet side.


Fruit is not my favorite style but NG does this nicely in an unthreatening way. I wouldnt have another by myself but would share one with some wine loving friends.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","UMNBeerhunter"

It was hard to get past the hugeness of the cherry but some light bready malt crept in there somewhere. Flavors followed suit. Each sip exploded with sweet cherries, a decent tartness puckered the mouth a bit. Finished somewhat dry with a lingering tartness and fresh cherry goodness.

This is an easy drinking beer. Its sweet and has a good fruit flavor to it. Carbonation sours the beer a little but it just serves to bring out the fruit flavor more. Drinkability high mouthfeel good.

4213,"2011-03-03",3.8,"Enjoyed from a 750ml bottle in a stemless wine glass.  The beer pours a nice ruby color, with a low head.  The nose shows notes of cherries, far fuller and with more depth than many other fruit beers.  The palate shows a level of sweetness similar to, if not quite as aggressive as, the Raspberry Tart, but stops short of cloying, and shows a level of fruit character unseen in any other example of the style Ive tried.  I was expecting some tart character, given the brewers prowess with lactobaccilus, however, none was found.  The finish is semi-sweet, and leaves a nice lingering note of the featured fruit; more refined and far less jammy than the aforesaid Raspberry Tart.  Overall, it is easy to see why there is so much hype for the beer, as it is the single best fruit beer available.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Appearance: pours brilliant red, mostly clear, unstable head dissipates quickly to a thin layer, some lacing.  Flavor: again very much dominated by cherries.  While the beer is cold, both sweet and sour cherry notes are present, and the sweetness is somewhat under control.  Some malt character and faint oak.  As it warms up, it really becomes quite sweet and the finish goes towards syrupy.  Palate:  medium-full body with high carbonation, becomes rather thick as the beer warms.  Very enjoyable brew if youre ready to be attacked by cherries, maybe a bit too sweet in the finish, but overall well done.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"

Shortly after the initial whiff though, it starts to smell like cough medicine (still okay but not quite my favorite smell) and then it actually starts to literally smell sweet. Okay, taste now. The first few sips are like the first few whiffs of smell. Great real cherry taste, sweet and definitely not sour.
5 minutes in and Im sick and tired of the syrupy flavor. Palate is flat and super sticky. I wanted to like this beer so bad, but in the end three of us ended up drinking a quarter of the bottle. I do believe it will make great ice cream sauce.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

Smells of fresh cherries, cherry juice, Sucrets.
Tastes of cherries are bountiful. Little bit on the sweet side, but not so much as it detracts from the overall flavor. Little sour on the back side. Great taste.
Sweetness coats the mouth and lips. The cherry sourness sticks to the sides of your tongue almost making you pucker. But not quite.
The cherry flavor would kind of get to me after a long bit, but I enjoyed drinking this one so much that I wish I had more. Maybe Ill retire near the brewery. Quite refreshing on a hot summer day. I would put this as a very drinkable beer.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

Has a solid tart Wisconsin cherry flavor that mixes with a tad bit of malt giving a cherry pie feel. I really like the taste of the cherries, there not the crappy sweet variety but there is an ample amount of sugar backing. It seems like there might be a few spices thrown in as well.

Pours a very dark ruby red color with a thin fizzy pink head that quickly fades into a lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing left.

Slightly tart and earthy aroma with a huge blast of cherry. It smells slghtly syrupy but the nose is dominated by the fresh cherries without much else to talk about.

Soft carbonation up rent with a huge sweet cherry flavor that dominates and lingers throughout into a slightly tart sweet finish. There is a subtle oak presence and some earthy wooden notes possibly from the cherry pits. This beer is very sweet but somehow manages not to be over the top with just a touch of balance that smooths things out. Very faint syrupy texture but not cloying.

4213,"2011-01-18",4.8,"Poured into a tulip. Thanks to alcstradamus for this one.

4.0 A: Murky amber red color sort of how dried blood looks. Two fingers of frothy white head with average retention and some lacing.

5.0 S: Holy shit, the cherries. I just had the Raspberry Tart and this is pretty much the same aroma, but with cherries. Cherries, cherries, cherries! Nothing but cherries. The cherries block out everything else. I didnt give the Tart a 5 on the nose, because I appreciate complexity, but i cant not give this a 5 because its so damn enticing.

5.0 T: Again, the cherries dominate the hell out of this beer, but it doesnt matter. Its so damn tasty. Cherries are mainly sweet, like maraschino cherries, but not in a fake way. Theres a subtle tartness that balances the sweetness well. Like the Tart, there isnt any malt or hops to talk about, but Im sure they do their part in the background.

5.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation is spritzy and dances on the tongue. Super smooth.

5.0 D: I need more of these fruit twins. This is the PERFECT dessert beer for both beer aficianados and BMC guzzlers alike. Im both sad and disgusted that I only have one bottle left.

4213,"2010-12-04",4.1,"Oooh, Pannepot may have met its match!  750mL waxed bottle brought back from Fond du Lac by a co-worker (thanks a ton!) two weeks ago.

Pours a semi-hazy ruby with a tan tinge and a well-fed off-white foamy head that doesnt last at all, but sticks nicely to the glass.  Aroma is potent, with sour cherries on top of bing cherries on top of cherry liquer, with a touch of almond aroma mixed in for an attempt at depth. :)

Flavor isnt exactly complex, but its great nonetheless.  More of what youd expect - cherries.  Not cherry extract though, this is the good stuff!  Sweet and tart cherries are balanced (to whatever extent one can balance cherry flavor) with nice earthy hop/malt flavors.  The only thing on this brew that takes a hit is the palate score, as I just cant see a session with the overwhelming mix of cherry flavor and high carbonation!","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

4213,"2010-11-28",4.2,"750 ml. bottle. I had this on Thanksgiving. Thanks, bro, for hooking me up with this insane bottle. Ive had this a few times, but have failed to rate it. This beer has a nice diaphanous appearance with a dark ruby color. I didnt try to agitate the beer while pouring to produce a head because the head doesnt last long. Very fruity bouquet of cherries. Ive never smelled a cherry beer like this beer. Generally, cherry beers tend to be subtle, at least the ones that I have had, but this is completely different. Nothing in terms of oak or hops come through in the aroma, but thats fine with me. I wish the oak would stand out more, but trust me, the aroma is still wonderful without it. Lovely, soft texture that glides easily across the taste buds. Not very effervescent, but that is a good thing, trust me. The cherry flavor is simply divine. Im usually not a fan of the fruit beers, but New Glarus seems to have something unique in the way that they brew their fruit beers. This is truly a great beer.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
4213,"2010-11-27",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 G: Half poured into a brandy snifter and half poured into a flute, per the bottles suggested glassware.

A: Beautifully bright dark cherry color with an off-white, red-tinted head that recedes rather quickly. Pretty decent lacing.

S: Sweet and tart cherries. Not that anyone outside of Chicago would recognize this reference, but it reminds me of the smell of a Jewel cherry lattice coffee cake, which in my book is a very good thing. Dont want to harp on this too much, but its unbelievable how much cherry smell there is without at all smelling like cherry cough drops or medicine.

T: Quite tart at the outset, fading into an incredible cherry sweetness. Cherry perfection. 

M: Light-bodied with moderate carbonation and a constant tartness. Beautiful.

D: Absolutely sublime. If I were able to get this at all times, I would never have a mimosa ever again. The perfect fruit-flavored concoction and a wonderful almost-summer treat. So long lawnmower ales, hello Wisconsin Belgian Red.

Remarkably unique beer albeit a touch too sweet for my personal tastes.  7/3/7/3/17.  Rerate.  Deep cherry red pour with some haze from the 2nd half of the bottle.  Smells like cherry pie filling.

Ruby red coloring with some nice lacing and a strawberry-cream head. The best way to describe this ""beer"" is an alcoholic cherry cream soda with a slightly bitter aftertaste.

4213,"2010-09-13",4.7,"after having a couple pretty good cherry beers over the last couple days, i started to become a little worried that i was hitting the top of the shelf for fruity, and that this beer would fall somewhere just above a 4. That wouldnt have been a disappointment, but there are a lot of 4 beers out there. Well, no worries there. My nostrils were assualted with the aroma of a liquified and carbonated cherry pie, and a good one at that. Holy @#$%! The body was a touch more brick red and less purple, and like I said, the aroma was heavenly. Combine that with just right carbonation and a wonderful fresh cherry flavor with a perfect balance of sweet & tart that I am still having a hard time wrapping my head around, and this was one of the best beers, and easily the best fruit beer Ive ever had. Thanks to Beerhunter for the trade...while i owe you a debt of gratitude, I now have to think of a way to hit you up for another, and maybe a raspberry tart and/or coffee stout as well :) Still not sure 24 hours later how they made a fruit beer this good!""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

That said, I would enjoy another small taste to give it a fairer shake.  This beer was quite sweet and tasted like concentrated cherry pie filling.  Good cherry pie filling, though, and no artificial fruit flavor.  That said, theres a strong cough syrup flavor in there, too.  The feel is less sticky than the taste would suggest, but it was still a bit much, at least coming to the beer without any foreknowledge.  Little to no oak was evident.  This is a beer that I might enjoy a lot more in specific circumstances, like as a compliment to a fancy dessert, but I cant say that I loved it on its own.

Pours a translucent red.  nice lively carbonation, little off-white head, and a little syrupy texture.  Taste is complex rich sweet cherry.  I have had this beer fresh, at three months, six months, nine months, one year, and one year and three months.  Fresh cherry flavor doesnt completely meld with the beer the cherry flavor sits on top a little.  The best for me was at six months.  At nine months this beer started down hill and at a year and three months the cherry was old tasting.  The rating is for the peak.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"

4213,"2010-05-27",4.4,"What can i say that hasnt already been said?  The aroma and ruby red color give you a strong hint of what is about to happen but not strong enough!  So many cherries from start to finish you wont even believe it.  Its almost too much... almost.  i barely notice the hops and barley and when i think of it i dont necessarily place it in the context of just beer, it is an amazing and unique beverage all around.  Great carbonation, the body is just the tiniest bit too thick for me but im nitpicking to even mention that.  The oak and vinuous qualities come through a bit more with age but i prefer the fresh cherry bomb.  One of my top 10 beverages everyone has to try.","Missouri, USA","mbsmith"
4213,"2010-05-26",1.9,"750 ml bottle poured into my lambic glass.

A- Body is beautiful. Its a nearly transparent, rich, dark, gem-like, cherry hue. Pours with a 1-2 finger foamy pink head. Head retains well at about 1/2 finger and leaves plenty of lacing down the glass.

S- Ripe cherry. Like when you open a jar of cherries soaked in cherry juice. Very rich. Cherry pits, cherry tartness, cherry sweetness. Not artificial whatsoever.

T- Taste is similar to the smell. Its very cherry all the way through. A hint more tart than sweet but there is a slight cherry pit woodiness to it as well. Taste is pretty consistent the whole way through and the flavor lingers for a while.

P- Low to medium carbonation with a rich, thick, and sticky mouthfeel.

O- In short I didnt really like this beer at all. I drank one lambic glass full and gave the rest away-which is easy because this is a very popular beer. To me it gave the impression of cough syrup without the medicinal aspect (which would have been an improvement...IMO). I really respect that this beer is all cherry without being artificial...which is why I am trying not to slam it too much...but this brew is just not for me.

Once again, some wood, syrup, and subtle notes of other complementary fruits.  Medium-bodied, with active carbonation that feels just right on the palate.

The flavour is a punch in the mouth with cherries. Super-d-duper cherry tart acidic mouth-feel, with some woody dryness. Thick cherry juice feel.

4213,"2010-02-28",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2012 Side-by-side comparison of a 750ml bottle from 2010 picked up at the Historic Casanova Liquors in Hudson, WI and a 750ml bottle from 2012 picked up last week at Sadhana Wine Shop in Madison, WI. Both pour a deep ruby, red-amber colored body with an inch thick, frothy, pink tinted beige head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. The 2012 is clear whereas the 2010 is cloudy. The 2012 aroma is bright and fresh, sweet cherries with barely a hint of oak and a light tartness. A bit of a syrupy sweetness. The 2010 isnt as bright and fresh, but the cherries really grow rich and more abundant because the slight oak disappears and the tartness gets just a tad funky and blends really nicely with the aged cherries. The flavors are similar. The 2012 has lots of sweet, fresh cherries with a nice tartness up front. Cherries get sweet and rich in the middle before a light oak comes in at the end with just a slight syrupy sweetness as it finishes clean, somewhat tart and dry, and full of sweet cherries. The 2010 has a bit less of a tartness up front, but its still there alongside plenty of sweet, rich cherries. The cherries arent quite as fresh and lively as the fresher bottle, but really give off a rich, cherry pie filling flavor that I really like. The tartness comes on nicely in the finish as well as plenty of sweet and rich cherries and a light funk as this ends clean, slightly tart and dry. Both leave lengthy aftertastes with plenty of rich and sweet cherries alongside a light tartness. Overall, a straightforward, but really enjoyable fruit beer. Plenty of rich and sweet cherries with a light tartness. The fresher bottle displays a slight oakiness and is much brighter, but the two-year-old bottle really accentuates the richness of the cherries nicely and gives off just a slight funk. Both of them are very similar, but their slight differences are appreciated. Great beer (8,4,8,4,14). Original Rating: (2/28/2010) 750ml bottle. Pours a mostly clear, deep ruby red body with a good amount of rising carbonation. Thin, pinkish-beige colored head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing. Aroma is sweet, rich cherries with a light tartness. Some other overripe fruits and oak. Flavor is similar. Lots of rich, sweet cherries with a light, tolerable tartness. A touch of oak, overripe fruits, a bit of cherry pie syrup. Finishes easy, smooth, and somewhat crisp with a hint of cloying sweetness and acidity. Medium length aftertaste after a medium, smooth body with a soft, fizzy carbonation. Overall, a nice fruit beer. Fairly sweet and cherry dominated while not being too sour. Maybe a bit one dimensional, but easy drinking and tasty, especially at only 5.1% (7,4,7,4,16=3.8).","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

  Cherry taste that stays with you for quite a while, so so smooth and even creamy with a great finish that never becomes cloying.  The biggest reason I give this such a high score is the finish.  It never even hints at that ""rotten"" sweetness that seems to pervade many of the lesser fruit beers.

4213,"2009-11-18",3.7,"Ruby red with a small off-white head that settles into a ring of lacings.

The aroma has lots of dominating sweet cherries. The cherry aromas are rather candy-like (guess thats what happens when you put so much cherries in the brew). Hints of grass and something in the line of cookies. Not a complex smell, and not very interesting, but my god does it smell like cherries.

The taste is way better than the smell. Sweet cherries up front (the cherries are still candy-like but not as much as in the smell). Notes of sweet malts. A gentle but noticeable tart note develops and is really welcome since it levels the sweetness nicely and really balances everything. Notes of cookies and earth. The finish is nicely dry and light with grassy notes and chemical cherries. Not very complex, but still with enough hints of other things than cherries to make it interesting and most importantly tasty.

Somewhat sticky in the mouth with a nice dryness in the finish. Medium body.

A good beer. The taste is better than the smell, thankfully. Impressive flavors considering the low ABV. I could really see this one working well as a dessert or coupled with dessert. But its too sweet to drink a lot of.

The cherry in the flavor is even more intense than the aroma and is fairly sweet but is not cloying nor does it taste like cough medicine.

Aroma is very fresh with essence of cherries, light malt, very soft fermentation characteristics, and a touch of woody earthiness. The flavor conveys an amazingly broad spectrum of cherry characteristics--sweet fruit, acidity, tannins, dark fruit complexity, cherry pit bitterness, and flavorful tartness.  This tartness seems to come from the sour cherries themselves rather than any secondary fermentation. This is truly a FRUIT beer. The body is light and nimble, delivering both the delicate nuances of the cherries at the same time as their more powerful overtones. This really is a fantastic beer.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Bottle from MrPickles 
Wow, now this is a fruit beer.  The aroma kicks ass.  Ive never smelled that type of completely pure fruity aroma from a beer.  Its all cherries from the minute you open the bottle.  It really smells more like a jar of fresh cherries than a beer.  The flavor is excellent.  I love the balance of the sweet fruity cherry flavors followed by a moderately tart finish.  Not as tart as the Raspberry Tart, but just enough make this a really interesting and enjoyable beer.  It barely even tastes like beer honestly.  Definitely unique and intriguing.

Really outstanding nose of ripe red cherries, mascarpone cheese and a breadiness that really ties it together nicely.

4213,"2009-09-06",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2010 Little head left, over amber-red beer. Fruity, syrupy nose, like an (older), slightly ripened sweet Liefmans kriek. Sour-sweet taste, with fruity sourness, definitely cherries, but somehow not 100% naturally tasting. In the finish, clear cherry syrup, or laid-up sugared cherries. Palate is too syrupy to be fully enjoyable as a fruitbeer, medium bodied. Despite the harsh words above, it is still better than remembered from the first encounter, now +/- 15 years ago - then it was a kind of BelleVue Kriek experience.

New try @ Kulminator. Similar to above, but this time unnatural flavour is more definable: cherrystones with loads of C=-N components, lending it a weird marzipan nose. Less in the flavour, as there is a real tartness, but again this almondy streak, that puts me off. Both sticky and tart, weird combination. Ill probably never really like it.

Maybe its just my preference for raspberries though, because the beers were almost the same except for the fruit flavor.   Red color with a small head.   The aroma is just a surge of cherry pie, almost leaning toward maraschino cherries in a fake way, but managing to tip-toe the line and come across a little more like pie-filling.   The flavor is pure cherry pie with a light tartness and surprising and welcomed lack of sweetness in the finish.

DO NOT tell anyone I loved a fruit beer.  This was the exception.  Poured a cloudy red, with minimal head and a dirty white lacing on the edge.  The aroma was that of fresh cherries.

4213,"2009-07-09",4.3,"Original review date 5/3/2008...from 750 into Riedel Extreme Burgundy/Pinot Noir glass.

Pours dark cider/caramel color with ample natural cherry hue. Carbonation cloys to bowl of glass; head very thin.

Perfumy, natural cherry essence brings the dominant scent here - slight tangy yeast and malt. Just enough citrus funk.

This is a treat - understated yet plentiful carbonation delivers a powerful cherry and natural sugar hammer with powerful force. Slight saltiness from carbonation. Nice backbone of yeast, slight citrus and braised malt.

This delivers much more of a hearty yet mellow (almost boiled? not a bad thing) mouthfeel. A slight salty tinge from the carbonation hits the back of the mouth with little aftertaste from a long and deep finish. Almost as if theres a significant tannin profile from the cherry skins as would be expected in wine. Gets stronger and more enjoyable with warmth.

This is a pleasure to savor but drinks much easier than other offerings crafted at this level of excellence. Great stuff.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Poured from the bottle, (champagne sized bottle) a red-brown color, high carbonation, but not too much.  The aroma was like cherry liquor, the taste of cherries was prominent, for me I got the sweetness not the sour or tartness that is often associated with cherry brews.  Its tough to describe in beer terms because its not what I think of as a beer, but it is not like a wine either. The 1-year aging is probably a major contributor to the taste.

Huge whiffs of cherries with some caramel and toffee, perhaps some wood too.  Incredibly soft and silky backing.  Prickly carbonation.  Huge fresh wild cherry flavor, its amazing how well crafted this is.  Did they just pick the cherries and shove them in this bottle?  Amazing stuff.  Original Rating:  Bottle courtesy of pfoxyjohn. Ive been wanting to try this and it didnt let down. Pours a murky reddish color with a sudsy head that is short lived and settles to patches. The aroma is not at all in your face with cherries as I might have expected, very nice, cherries, sugar, malt, a real nice scent that seems to pick up steam the more I smell it. Flavor is tart at first then a silky smooth cherry taste.  Malt content is definitely there to give it a nice creamy backing that compliments the tart flavor very well. The finish is just slightly cherry tart but subtle. Velvety and soft from start to finish, authentic flavors, or so it seemed to me. Obviously very well crafted.

Everything about this beer is balanced, the rhine tartness follows through the beer pefectly and not overly done. The cherry flavor is extravagant. Palate duration is above average and head retention. The beer is extremely drinkable for all palates making this 750ml go down very nicely.

Pours a rusty red, some haze, small white head that dissipates to a film. Aromas arent overly sweet, but preach natural slightly sour cherries over all. Light malty sweetness swallowed up by the fruit. Initial is a bit fizzy, a bit tart cherry that is evenly balanced, preaching bitter tartness and sweetness in near perfect harmony. I can see why this would be a very high scoring fruit beer. It is hard to say more about this than cherries in perfect balance, nothing cloying and overbearing, but nothing lacking real natural flavor and complexity.

Taste is sweet, black cherries, cherry pie, rich and viscous with a major spiced note of cinnamon and nutmeg. Palate is rich, creamy, dessert like, not oily or watery. Its not the show stopper that NG Raspberry Tart and NG Apple Ale are, but it is evident that if you like true cherry beer and arent in the mood for kriek, this is the ultimate non-sour cherry fruit beer.

Cracked this open to share with dear ol dad on Fathers Day. Belgian Red pours a glimmering ruby with a touch of haze. A fizzy two finger champagne like head forms on the pour and fizzles down to a ring after a couple minutes. Small patchy lacing slides down the flute back into the body after each drink. A delicious looking dessert beer!

When I stick my nose in the glass it fills with all kinds of cherry. Cherry pie filling, tart cherries, Bing cherries, and maraschino cherries are all present and accounted for. Extremely mouthwatering, bold and to the point. An excellent rich aroma coming from an excellent beer. 

Everything the nose suggested the flavor delivers. The immense cherry flavors start with a quick flash of tartness followed by the sweetened cherry pie filling and Bing cherries mid-palate. Finishes with another flash of the slightly tart cherries. All this cherry flavor really comes together to create something special.

Body is on the fuller side of medium with a bit of stick. Although the body is on the fuller side it moves through nicely and has a great smoothness.

This is a beer to be savored. The intense cherry flavors keep this from being guzzled but it is one easy beer to put away. 

New Glaruss fruit beers stand a top a line up full of gems. The Belgian Red is all at once tart, tangy, and sweet with an incredible depth of flavor. You will have a hard time finding any other fruit beer that can come close to this one, flavor-wise.

Aroma of very juicy cherries, similar to black cherries, simple yet fresh and enticing.  First taste is acidic followed immediately by tart and ever so juicy sour cherries, this stuff is sooo tasty Im trying to gulp it. It really tastes like a cherry capri sun and the yeast adds that pie crust like effect.  Long acidic finish.

No medicine or acidicness in the aroma at all. Flavor is much the same. Cherries, cherries, and more cherries.

Pale malt noticeable with warmth. Refreshing palate that’s well carbonated but full bodied and lush, playing right into the rich, sweet flavor.

My favorite fruit beer when fresh, but this particular bottle is aged a year.  Not sure what the aging protocol is for fruit beers.  Pours a burgundy red with a minimal head.  Aroma is somewhat sour and sweet at the same time, with loads of cherries (pretty much the same as when fresh).  Flavor is cherry pie in a glass, and is amazingly more crisp tasting than when fresh.

I was worried that this would be an over-sweetened lambic-esque beer, but it was not.  Incredibly balanced, but still allowed that gorgeous cherry flavor to shine through.  Poured a deep reddish light brown and a small white head.  Aroma was cherries and a little smoky, barrel-aged tinge.

4213,"2008-11-21",4.4,"Brewed with Montmorency Cherries (purportedly a pound of whole cherries per bottle), locally grown wheat, and Hallertau hops, the beer is then left to mature in 12 ft. tall oak tanks. Okay, great, let’s get to it. Murky ruby-hue capped by a flamingo-pink head appearance and harbors an aroma reeking of unabashed cherrynicity, there’s nothing fake or artificial about this beer. With a taste reminiscent of fruit leather, the flavor is certainly aggressive in it’s sheer determination to cram that pound of cherries down your damn throat. It deftly walks the fine line between sweet and tart and carries with it a jolt of juicy, cheek-pinching acidity. The malted wheat and hops definitely take a backseat to the deep, strong cherry fruitiness. God, I hope you like cherries. The high level of carbonation in the beer does well to bring a much-needed levity to what otherwise would be a thick, syrupy body. You do like cherries, right?

The tartness and carbonation provide a prickly mouthfeel that lasts ages on the tongue.  All other flavors are a supporting cast, but are there: malts give a brown sugar cast to the sweetness, and a mellowness underneath all the sparkles on the palate.

It has such a natural fruit presence in the flavor! It’s both sweet and tart simultaneously, with notes of candied cherries, sweet notes with almond-like character of marzipan. The later cherry flavors lean toward earthier notes of skin-tannins, along with a very subtle cinnamon-like spiciness when it warms, and the slightest touch of graham cracker towards the clean finish.

4213,"2008-08-24",2.1,"this smells like cherries. it looks like cherry juice. guess what? it tastes like carbonated cherry juice. hops? hmmm....cant find em. malt? uh, no. what exactly makes this a beer? maybe if it had more alcohol i could at least be reminded that i was drinking something ’beer-like’. but thats not there either. according to this website, which i practically live by, this is one of the best beers IN THE WORLD. this doesnt taste bad, but this doesnt satisfy my palate. this is not challenging. this is not nuanced. this is so far from actual beer i wonder should it get a .5? maybe there should be an option to rate ’n/a’. i have drank fruit beers that were very strongly flavored but they at least looked like beer, and there was always something in there that reminded me of yeast/hops/malt.  there are a pound of cherries in this bottle.  i am not trying to go against the grain or rebel. i am not trying to be a punk rock beer rater. i want to like this beer. i do like other new glarus beers and it seems they do know what they are doing. this stuff however seems to be only enjoyable by people that dont like beer.  the difference between this and premium cherry juice is very small. this is not overly sweet to be honest, but i dont find that it is very balanced by much sourness either.  what exactly makes this belgian? i dont detect any belgian spice, belgian yeast or belgian funkiness. maybe my palate is retarded, if those things are in fact present for someone else they are at best very subtle. this is one dimensional.  most of all, this is disappointing.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
4213,"2008-08-21",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2010 On a recent trip to Wisconsin, I picked up 3 bottles of this to bring home with me.  Ive been looking forward to tasting this for a long time.  
First whiff reminded me of Cherry Coke.  As I poured it in to a glass the cherry aroma grew 10 times.  This is the most fragrant beer Ive ever had.  
I knew this would taste sweet, but it was even sweeter than expected, but the sourness balanced it out nicely.  This is definitely a high quality beer and I was only mildly disappointed.  My expectations going in may have been too high.  Its almost perfect, but wish it was a little less sweet and had a maltier/heavier body...body seemed a bit on the light side. 
Re-Rate 6/26/10 - Ive had a few bottles of this since my first rating above, basically any time I can get my hands on it, I do.  Only sold in Wisconsin.  This is the king of all fruit infused beers.  Amazing cherry-pie flavor.","Carver, Minnesota, USA","vikingguy"
4213,"2008-08-17",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2008 Bottle. Pours murky reddish-chestnut, capped with a small tan head. Aroma of tart cherries, like pie filling, with vanilla and brown sugar. The aroma also reminded me a bit of Hawaiian Punch. Beautiful tart cherry flavor, very reminiscent of pie filling, with cinnamon, spice, brown sugar, and some balsamic vinegar.  This beer really stands out due to its balance between sweet and tart, with the tartness prevailing slightly. Tremendous beer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"

Aroma is simply dominated by cherries with some sugar sweetness and is amazing. Unsurprisingly, the flavor is cherry and sweet fruits (tinges of strawberry and rhubarb), bread malts masquerade as pie crust, finishes sweet with light tartness. Sticky sweet texture and ample carbonation. An absolute standout in the fruit beer genre, New Glarus has this category absolutely cornered.

The nose is amazing: Grandmas cherry pie; not just pie filling but the whole shebang: tart cherries, gooey pie filling, and sugar-coated crust. Very nice. Light to medium-bodied and slick with a dry, tart finish. The flavor is of sweet, tart, round sour cherries and a light, dry woodiness. This is a damned fine beer.

If you like cherries then you are going to love this brew.  Succulent with just a bit of tartness to get the saliva flowing.  Extreamly easy drinking.

4213,"2008-07-15",4.2,"Vintage 1996

Pours mahogany with a deep ruby hue when held to the light. The head rises to an inch-plus, beige in color and dense as whipped egg whites.
Retention duration is several minutes before settling in the glass and leaving a few ripped sheets of lacework.

Aromatics are pungently filled with vineous cherries. A tart nod adds complexity and the beer is intensely inviting.
Beyond the cherries, there is a hint of caramel malt and cinnamon.

Creamy, lucious mouthfeel. The beer floats across the tongue.

A whallop of juicy cherries starts off the pallet, and tart vineousity follows. Becoming remarkably wine-like and a bit tannic.
Hints of balsamic vinegar, rhubarb, and red Zinfindel.

Some coarseness on the back of the throat lingers in the finish, along with unrelenting juicy cherries.

Twelve years on it’s side in a cool cellar has treated this beer right. It’s dried up a bit, and the tartness has stepped up to allow another dimension to shine through.

Like marachino cherries or cherry cough syrup.  The flavor though is wonderfully complex.  Tart, sour, sweet and bitter with lots of strong cherry up front, but so much more going on underneath.

Holy Moses, this stuff smells spectacular.  Obviously, a lot of cherries in the nose, but not intensely tart.  Its like someone dumped some ripe cherry juice into the beer with a heavy sweetness that balances the tartness out.  There was a hint of the wheat, some molasses and cinnamon.

The taste is fantastic as well and a tad more tart than the smell.  Again, a touch of grains in the finish along with a hint of oak, but not a lot is getting through the cherries in there.  Thats a compliment for this beer.

Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and highly carbonated.

Drinkability isnt as high as it could be because of the heavy sweetness, but thats really nitpicking.  I am not the biggest fan of fruit beers, but this is, without a doubt, the best one I have ever tasted.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Appearance: A warm, sumptuous burgundy-fuschia rouge. No head to speak of, but what an interesting color.

Flavor: When my brother first told me about this beer, he said it tastes just like cherry pie, and man, he wasnt kidding. Sweet, tart, very natural-tasting cherries, a touch of cinnamon spice, and some doughy notes, most likely from the wheat and roasted malts. Such a festive ale! I dont usually like sweet beers, but this is just plain delicious. Not artificial or syrupy in the least. Finish is clean and sour.

Palate: Sparkly and light, matches the tartness perfectly.

The cherries seem so fresh and juice, its almost unbelievable.  Surprisingly, the oaky vanilla asserts itself quite a bit, as does a somewhat lactic creaminess.  Its almost unfathomable that this is actually a beer, as it drinks more like a cream soda blended with fresh cherry juice.  Medium bodied and sweet, this one sports a fine but lively carbonation.  This could definitely be an excellent gateway beer, as its appeal would certainly be broad.  For what it is, this is excellent.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Pours a murky red with a small head. Point off of appearance for the waxing fail. Cherry nose, mild tartness, cookie dough, light spices. Highly carbonated texture borders on prickly.
Im initially taken aback by how sweet the beer is. Its very much a fruit juice, enormous powerful cherry flavor, some sweet n sour ketchup. I certainly see the cherry pie comparison that everyone is making. Weve got the sweet acidity of pie cherries with every bit of their flavor jammed into the beer, the light pie spices, even the flaky, slightly buttery, gently sweet crust. Definitely all of that going on. What is not going on is any sense of beer. There is nothing here that tells me this is a beer, no funk, no wildness, no dry tannic flavors, no musty interest. As a result Im left disappointed by what is ultimately a very tasty soda pop.

I am not normally a beer drinker but I rave about this to everyone. You would think that it may not mesh just right for your palate initally, but the cherry notes are perfect,  and almost provides a lingering sweet cherry aftertaste, over the initial boldness. The carbonation level is perfect, it is lightly carbonated in my opinion. There is no slack in the brewing of this gem, batch after batch this stuff is perfect.

I just smiled when I smelled this.  I dont really feel the need to describe the aroma, just because it would be about 15 positive adjectives followed by the word cherry.  Suffice to say this is a 10 on aroma.  Taste is the same.  I really dont get much more from the taste or aroma than cherry, but that does not make it any less complex or interesting than I expected.

Awesome Red Color with a very tiny red tinged white head. Some lacing and a ridiculous sour cherry arome. The taste is sour cherries and vanilla. The oak aging comes through.

4213,"2008-03-20",4.2,"Opening a New Glarus brew always produces a moment of excitement in me  particularly for specimens of such renown. As a raspberry enthusiast, I tend to cast an exigent eye on the fruits use. Consequently, New Glarus Raspberry Tart left me slightly underwhelmed, I felt the medium of beer wasnt fully explored. However, its cherry-saturated counterpart, the Belgian Red, held less demanding expectations yet exceeded even those I had set for the former. The pour produced an extravagant red mire accented of magenta. Pink fizz churned from the murk. Painted thick, the nose is equally rich, exuding expansive cherry aromas. The fruit is present but variegated, sometimes showing a waxy Twizzler-like sweetness, other times a genuine red cherry sourness. The nostalgic aroma of Sweet Tarts is unmistakable and supplemented by marshmallow and Smarties (of the American variety). Hints of brown sugar, spice and Cherry Coke add a distinctive flair. The flavor further underscores Sweet Tarts and pleasantly sour cherries.  The beer is sweet but neither syrupy nor sugary, it strikes a good balance between fruit and beer. Rich tonalities of vanilla, butter and almond paste hit the right notes, added to the enjoyable fizziness. The long sticky sour aftertaste hints at a subtle oaking. All in all, a beautiful brew and truly a fine example of New Glarus craft. (22/04/07)","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

There is a presence of mild molasses and herbal hops. Its like candy, its so sweet, but not in a cloyong way because the herbal finsh adds some balance.

4213,"2008-01-01",4.5,"Jan. 2006 - I dont really like fruity beers. They should either taste like beer with just a TAD of fruit or be so fruity that you can barely tell that it is a beer.

4213,"2007-12-30",4.2,"I was so pumped to try this, I had it in the cellar less than a day before I gave myself an excuse to open this gem.  Pours a translucent, nearly opaque, deep ruby color with a foamy white head that quickly disappears.  Aroma is of sour fruits, sugar, candy, life savers.  Flavor is all tart fruit, rasberry, cherry, sweet, sour, lemon.  My only complaint would be that I expected more beer flavor, more malt please?  Also, the Hallertau hops are tough to notice until the very end when you get some hop bitterness around the mouth.  Finish is great, goes down very easy and its smooth.  This beer is clearly about the fruit, but the cherries arent so sweet you feel like youre drinking KoolAid.  The fruit is subtle, as subtle as you can get from a fruit beer.  Great beer, so unique but also very drinkable.

The flavor included strong cherry notes, mild wheat, and more lasting, sweet cherry.  While being fairly aggressive and sweet, the flavor was not cloying.  Excellent fresh fruit sweetness and flavor.  The mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied with a nice helping of lively carbonation.

Sweet fermented malt and wheat tones start at every sip, then followed by slightly tart cherry notes, while the carbonation keeps the flavors going. Definitely a vinous wine with the sweet fruit flavors taking over. I got a slight cough-medicine finish on the palate, but this beer pulled through past my expectations.

Very sweet.  A bit tart.  Apple pie comes on strong.  Dead ringer for the real thing, spices and all, other than that cherry thing going on here.  Lingering cinnamon.

4213,"2007-10-18",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2012 Sometimes you just want something sweet.  You desire it, you crave it, and then you hunt it.  And once you bite into that supine ripple of caramel or dunk your tongue in a fruity smoothie you reach a recognizably blissful nirvana for those first moments between mastacation and digestion.  Then things sort of go down hill.  Your blood sugar rises, you become feverish, and then the high collapses, leaving the nonplussed drinker in the doldrums.  But it was worth it.  New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red is like the sweetest of candies.  Its tooth rattling sugar content will cause even the most dedicated sugar hound to ball up in a fructose overdose.  Weve come to expect this from sweet beers, even lambics, but the finest fruit lambics come with complimentary and complementary complexity.  It might be a genuine fruit flavor or the dulcet tastes of berries not native to the beer style, but the superior side of these sipid, sweet suds are distinct from the careless soda-pop brews made by burnt out brewers.  Which camp does the Wisconsin Belgian Red belong to?  In a radical departure from all other sampled sweet beers, it sits right in the middle.  Theres plenty of cherry flavor in this vibrant, coral pink beer, but is neither genuine cherry flavor nor artifical cherry flavor.  The aroma piques the senses with Cherry Coke, cherry sours, cherry pies and cherry streudel, but nothing that squarely places it at the orchard or the candy aisle at 7-11.  The taste flirts with the tongue, doling out valentines of subliminated, consummate cherry flavor with a gentle splash of apple, but lots of refined sugar as well.  My teeth shake and protest, trying to free themselves from the crimson tide they awash in, but to no avail.  My tongue begins to shrivel, losing water in the hypertonic fluid, and the walls of my mouth begin to develop geological sugar deposits.  Before long there are developed sugar stalagtites.  Enough is enough, and I quickly finish the glass.  New Glarus paean to cherries is a stalwart attempt at capturing the raw, dessert flavor of cherry - the kind of macerated, gooey fruit we like in our cobblers and pies, but it goes a hair too far.  Instead, the Wisconsin Belgian Red brews up a fierce cherry rampage, too dedicated to the candy quality of cherries to pay heed to their fruitier, mellower and more complex half.  To that end, it is a sweet beer, satisfying the most ravenous sweet tooth with ample sugar to spare.  

Updated tasting notes from August 30th, 2010 - Fresh aroma, smells more powerfully of raspberries than cherries. Completely fresh aroma, like the fruits dropped from the vine into the bottle. As the beer breathes a deep, spine stingingly sweet cherry aroma appears too. The flavor is very sweet, like a luxury candy, before the aftertaste drops all the brighter and more artificial sugar flavors and doubles down on the raw flavor of uncooked, ripe cherries. Same with the raspberry dimensions. The first taste is the strongest, and the foretaste is where the carbonation is most heady, but as it clears I receive a wide dimension of fruit flavors on the palate. Impressive.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
4213,"2007-10-15",4.6,"Simply a cheery (not cherry) sweet aroma.  Abundant flavor. 
The color is quite festive. This beers overall finish hints at a fine homemade cherry tart or pie.

Awesome aroma. Freshly picked perfectly ripe cherries. The flavor starts with hints of tartness and sour yeast that quickly get consumed by sweet and tart ripe cherries fresh from the cherry tree. It gets sweeter and sweeter and richer and richer before some sourness comes back into play. Great tasting brew. Wow!  Thanks Jason.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Medium-bodied with a complex fruit character of fresh cherries and strawberries along with spices and malts. Light wheat and yeast undertones at times.

He rated New Glarus Belgian Red as one of the top ten beers in America in 2002: http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001726.h   A great beer for a great man.  Bottle from iowaherkeye in June 2007.  Pours a deep cloudy red color with a hint of brown.  No head, but finely carbonated with a microbubble splash eminating from the pour.  Aroma is of a malted cherry cheesecake, and oak deceptively combining to allude to cinnamon.  Aaah, a beer so pleasant in aroma in need not be consumed.  No!  It must be consumed.  The taste is mild, lightly carbonated, and at the same time very flavorful.  A masterfully brewed beer with high residual sweetness, so the taste of cherries is complete.  Easy to drink.

It does have a definite malt presence, but doesnt have the sticky cloyingness that an American wheat beers have. Its drinkablity depends on your tollerance for cherries.

When poured, the color is an enchanting ruby brow.  Aroma brings me to Summer, with the smells of fresh cherry pies wafting carelessly through the air, drawing me in deeper in.

Still, I love sour, so it is difficult for me to badmouth this beer.

Smelt of strong tart cherries, baked cherry pie, candi cherries, spiced cherry jam and fermented cherries by the windowsill.

Taste was upfront strong sweet and sour cherry juice followed by a stronger sweetness on the follow through to a nice mellow moderate sweet and sour finish.  All cherries.

Palate was cherry.
 
Overall, holy fucking cherries!  Im happy I shared this with semi knowledgeable beer friends, because it was great, but also  theres no way I could have drank a whole bottle.  Its just too much cherries.  One glass is a great treat though. Cherries.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"

4213,"2007-07-17",3.8,"A wonderful beverage, but I struggle a little to rate this, because it really doesnt have a lot of beer-like qualities.  It takes a pretty vigorous pour to get much of a head.  The aroma is a hedonistic cherry immersion, and the flavor is more of the same -- tart, fresh, delicious.  Malt and hops are undetectable, as is the alcohol.  Actually, even a little bit of an alcohol burn would push it to a higher level for me.  Recommended, definitely, but I do have to rate it in the context of a beer.  (And while were at it -- Leinenkugels Berry Weiss gets beaten up in reviews on this site for its lack of beerlike qualities.  While its certainly not in the class of New Glarus Belgian Red for other reasons, I feel this is an example of the anti-big brewer bias that sometimes rears its head here.)","Hartland, Wisconsin, USA","Flyer"

4213,"2007-07-04",4.5,"I just bought another case of this. I cant think of another beer I buy by the case. I could drink one of these every day for the rest of my life and never tire of it. Its not my favorite, but it always brightens my day and never ceases to amaze. The pour is very hazy, luminous reds and browns swirling around each other. A small off-white head with pink tinted splotches forms and dissipates quickly. The glow of such a deep, murky color scheme is astounding. The aroma is very sweet and very peircing. Notes of fresh cherries, pie crust, light spices and not a hint of alcohol. Anything in the aroma that is not a scent directly related to fresh cherries probably comprises less than five percent of the total. This is also the absolute, definitive benchmark example of fruit extraction into aroma without creating even a hint of a medicinal character...it just smells like ripe fruit, freshly picked. The flavor is also highly sweet, with small intermittent hints of acidity. No medicinal qualities found here either, even though it is incredibly sweet and has no noticeable backing bitterness. Tartness is moderate and steady throughout. The finish is sublime; very sweet, cherry pie notes lingering on until the next sip, or a sip of something else comes along. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, which in this case is welcome as it helps to further accentuate the lovely fruit composite. Medium to medium-heavy in body, very smooth and rigid in its structure. Truly breathtaking.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

This was the tenth of 26 beers that I sampled and rated during the tasting. I finally got a chance to taste this legend of a beer, and it did not fail to live up to the hype. Extremely tart and extremely strong cherry and cherry pie aroma. Pours a reddish light brown that is mostly clear but ends up rather opaque. Unique, strongly tart, and sour cherry flavor. Tastes like I am drinking cherry pie. Long, fruit-sour aftertaste. Medium body. Smooth, slick, and very lively in the palate. I generally wouldnt drink this if I were in the mood for a beer.

4213,"2007-05-02",4.4,"Thanks to NFLMVP for trading me this bottle.  Thick and rich in the mouth, but light on the tongue as well with the carbonation. Not tart at all, but has a certain wild bite to it.  Very nice sweetness enhanced by, and enhancing, the massively beautiful fresh cherry flavor.  Still, despite the lack of tartness or sourness, it finishes dry.  Also a good amount of a flavor of mulled spices.  Reminds me a good bit of apple cider.  What apple cider would taste like with a huge cherry addition.  I actually expected it to be far more tart and/or sour.  If it were, this would be one of my absolute favorite beers, but I am a huge sucker for flemish sours.  As it is, other than KRE, a fruit beer cant get much better.  Complex, rich, tasty.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

Other nuances of pommegranite, lemonaide, w/  slight biscuiting. The finish is bitterd w/ a tar, acidic component. This brew is thirst quenching and very drinkable. I have to add.

Tart and sweet cherry aromas, remeniscent of a cherry lollipop, and maybe due to the color, but I also get some apple notes.  Not much in the way of mallts as far as aroma goes until it warms up.  After it warms, it becomes biscuit malt like, and still intensely cherry.  Flavor is again, very intensely cherry, lightly tart in the finish, and balances in the aftertaste.  Cherry throughout the flavor from start to finish.  Also sweet in the finish.  Seems to be very little malt presence beyond the cherries, maybe a little bready, but beyond that, very cherry dominated.  Medium carbonation, medium body, and a bit of a burn from alcohol, surprising w/ a 5.1% beer.  Overally I enjoy this beer!  I wouldnt drink more than one at a time, but I like cherries/cherry flavors, and sweet things, so that could explain my fascination w/ this particular beer.Very unique and would probably go well wil a lot of desserts.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

4213,"2007-03-21",5.0,"Ive enjoyed this fruit nectar on many occasions in the last few years, but only recently did I purchase a bottle with the intent to rate it. New Glarus Belgian Red is the greatest evidence that beer can be civilized and classy. Beer lovers rave about it, casual beer drinkers rave about it, and beer haters rave about it. Pours a beautiful light red with a nice pinkish head of foam, small CO2 bubbles race up the sides of the pint glass. This beer is best served in a champagne flute or perhaps a tulip, fwiw. The cherry nose is similar to NGs Cherry Stout: sweet yet tart cherries. This is not cloyingly saccharine in the least. The flavor is much of the same cherry balance. Very refreshing during any point of a meal. Words cant do this fine concoction justice. It really is a beer that has to be tasted to understand.

4213,"2007-03-04",5.0,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2008 I just cant fight it any longer. Had this again last night thanks to Gillard, and this time instead of being the best beer Ive had after only ~30 beers, its still the best beer Ive had after ~600 beers. I feel more comfortable now giving this beer an even higher score with that experience in mind. Cherry pie filling, vanilla bean, cherry soda, the nose has it all. What sets this beer apart is the flavor has a tartness to it and just enough acidity to offset the sweetness. Palate is viscous while being spritz, and perfect for the style, supremely drinkable. Ive had this on 4 separate occasions now from 4 different bottles and its been this good each time. Its the best smelling and best tasting beverage I have ever consumed, and I dont see any possible way it could be any better. So I have to give it a perfect score.

Huge thanks to jonboy32818 for sharing this at the O Town Throwdown. Wonderfully cherry red pour, small white head. Aroma is full on cherry, tartness, yeast, malt. Very sticky, clinging moutfeel. Feels very nice rolling around on the tongue. Flavor is cherry, cherry, cherry. Some nice sour notes to keep everything together. Smelling this beer you have a fear that it could be too sweet, but it never approaches that, keeping everything wonderfully blended. I could honestly drink this every day if I could get it here in Florida. The single best tasting beer I have ever had. A defining experience.

4213,"2007-03-01",4.6,"What can I say? This beer is in its own class. It has the fruit of a lambic laid over the rich maltiness and yeastiness of a classic belgian style ale. I even detect a bit of bitter hops to balance the cherry sweet & sour notes. This is probably the best beer brewed in Wisconsin and rivals finest from Belgium, the UK or Michigan. If I could reimagine it to my own perfection it would have a tad more alcohol kick near the finish, but thats quibbling with perfection.","USA","pHunbalanced"

Well, finally tonight I found a worthy event to commemorate and brought this out of my cellar - woohoo!  As I poured this garnet colored brew into a champagne flute, I was struck by its clarity, plentiful bubble streams and fine pinkish head.  I was also struck by the aroma of pie cherries.  Sticking my nose into the glass, the tart cherry smell increased exponentially and dominated my olfactory sensors, but in the background I could also detect light hoppy and woody notes as well.  The flavor is again almost overpowering with sweet and tart cherry, but its softened a bit by a rich wheat and barley malt character, and made more complex with hints of yeastiness, mellow wood and earthy notes.  Body is light to medium with a generous amount of carbonation, not quite champagney in character, but still nicely assertive on the tongue.

Huge sweet cherry aroma with additional notes of vanilla, and some pale barley malt. Very large in the mouth with the cherries obviously taking centre stage, along with a bit of other red berry fruit. As sweet as it is, there are more dimensions than sweet fruit to this beer, with notes of vanilla and earth. Its smooth on the palate, yet theres enough earthy bitterness to keep things in check.

4213,"2006-12-20",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2007 Pours to orangey red from one of the most attractive bottles of all time, producing a pinkish beige head.  The pound of cherries in my Belgian Red dances enticingly in the air, with silken oak and vanilla gracefully bedding it back down.  Flavor is glorious, the taste of the Garden of Eden before the fall.  Sour and sweet cherry with a hint of chocolate and the tears of angels.  Tartly acidic in the mouth with a dry, distantly woody finish.  Perfect for the holidays, or maybe the afterlife... a true achievement in artistic craft. 
Updated.  An undefinitively aged bottle. Spicier and less forceful aroma.  Develops an odd beet flavor glazing what is more a thick fruitcake body than a brilliant mash of cherries.  Less perfect but nonetheless intriguing and still satisfying.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Aromas of freshly mashed cherries with light yeastiness and wheat malts.

Good, even, steady carbonation and a dry, softly crisp, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel, pretty close to perfect.

Delicious tasting, fresh red cherry mash with a sugary tartness, a good acidity, a very light sour breadiness, a subtle hop flavor and bitterness, a slight alcohol warmth in the palate, and a dry cherry and malty finish.

New Glarus Belgian Red is a muddy claret color with a fizzy white head that bubbles away quickly.  The aroma is all  cherry and is sweet, but also has a slight ""tang"" to it.  Like the aroma, the flavor is cherry and has a wonerfully balanced sweet and sour/tart thing going on.  There is a hint of ""beer"" flavor just before the enjoyable, fuity finish.  The beer feels soft and juicy in mouth, medium body over all.  This beer is well carbonated, but not too much to the point that it is fizzy.  The cherry aroma and flavor are 100% real - no artificial qualities at all!  This is a fantastic beer and was well worth the trip to the brewery to pick up a few bottles!  On top of that, this is another beer that my wife actually likes (she would have given it a 4.9)!

4213,"2006-09-21",2.7,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2009 bottle. Im always skeptical when a fruit-flavored beer is so critically acclaimed. This pours very, very red with a decent white head. The aroma is packed completely full of cherries with some cinnamon perhaps in the background.  The mouth again is loaded down with cherry with a finish like frosted Pop-tarts.  The mouthfeel is very fizzy but slightly sticky, mostly with sweetness. I can say that the cherry flavor is very natural.  I find the use of the word ""Belgian"" in the title to be rather misleading. This flirts with the problem of being cloying. Its just so fruity and sweet, not really my favorite thing in a beer. I split the 750 with my girlfriend (thank God). I dont think I could take a whole bottle of this stuff. This would be okay in small doses as a dessert, I suppose.  I find it slightly baffling this would have such universal appeal among beer lovers since it lacks an abundance of more typical beer qualities. This doesnt make it onto my personal favorite 50 beers, anyway.

Big bottle. Pours red. Really red. This is cherry juice. Now, okay, it is not soda-like. It is very natural cherry flavor. However, that is all that is here. This smells exactly like pure cherries. This tastes excatly like pure cherries. The finish has a bit of breadiness that makes this taste like liquid cherry pie. There is no other flavor or aroma. This does not resemble beer in any way due to the lack of hop, yeast, or malt flavor. This is cherry extract.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

4213,"2006-09-15",4.5,"This beer poured a dark glowing red with a few light purple highlights. It was very clear with little bubbles clinging to the inside of my glass. The head was thin, off white and pink that left a thin and delicate lace. Smells initially of sweet cherry pie filling that, for an instant, is rather disappointing. Fortunately, the smell is then backed up with a musky sourness that adds a terrific amount of life and wholesomeness. Along with this fantastic cherry, there seems to be a musky lambic-like yeast. Tastes of powerfully tangy wild cherries. This is not just cherry sweetness, but the flavor clearly reflects actual cherry skin! This, combined with (what Im guessing to be ) the musky wild yeast creates a smooth and tangy cherry experience that is absolutely amazing. This is quite an accomplishment for the people at New Glarus. (thank you!) The mouth feel had a light soft body with a medium tingly carbonation thats a wonderful compliment to the tangy aspects of the flavor. I think that the mouth feel plays a crucial role in the delivery of the flavor, earning a high rating form me. 

Delicious! Absolutely delicious! This is so easy to drink and just dripping with quality and care. Theres a quality here that makes me wish there was a NA version of this available to have with breakfast every morning. I think Ill never be able to tolerate fake cherry flavors ever again.

After I gave it a little time to breathe and warm, the sweetness took over.  I never really got the cherry pie sense (especially not in the nose)  In fact, the nose was a little weak.

Never had a drink that so much like the actual fruit. Wow. Leaves a great taste on the palate.

Slightly sour makes the mouth water.  Body like a cider with just a smidge of carb giving a back tongue bite.  Really balances out the sweet nicely.  Theres an earthiness thats irresistible.  Yum.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

Some oak, vanilla and almonds too.  Ample carbonation upfront, yet still goes down smooth.  Starts with some incredible tart and tangy cherries.  A little syrupy, kinda juicy and very delicious.  Finishes with a rich, oaky smoothness full of delicate liqueur-like vanilla and roasty almond flavors.  VERY flavorful, but never overwhelming.  Quite drinkable.

4213,"2006-08-16",4.6,"Big thanks to moejuck!! This starts out incredible, bypasses awesome and enters into Elixer of the Gods territory. Aroma is subdued cherries, vanilla and malt. Appearance is slightly hazy red with a bit of brown. Mouthfeel is light and slightly fizzy. Flavors were just bursting with cherries and it was simply incredible. Slightly creamy, acidic, sweet, and tart. It was an excellent example of having a lot of different taste angles going on. If only more American breweries would take this excellent example and use it as a watermark. It could have been much better in the aroma and appearance but thats nitpicky. Overall it was fantastic. Definitely worth the status.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Color is very appealing - a bloody ruby red with carbonation visible in the light,  The light does a great job illuminating the entire beer but looks murky when away from the light.  Aroma is strong - all cherry - sour-sweet, earthy and slightly toasty.   Taste is all cherry as well but TOO cherry for me.  While I enjoy this in the aroma, the flavor is not ""beer"" enough.  Taste just like my grandmas cherry kompot.  Very sweet, medium body, no bitterness.  My girlfriend  really likes the stuff so I pretty much got it for her.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Aroma of lovely sweet ripened cherries, sweet cherry juice, bread crusts, and a bit of spice.  Flavor is much the same with some cinnamon, caramel, oak, and some light tart acidity.  Semidry spicy finish.  Moderate carbonation with 
a light body.  Overall pretty sweet and delicious--perfect for dessert.  Old rating follows.  750mL, no date--though I picked this up in May of 2006.  Pours a cloudy brown red with a small reddish white head.  Strong aroma of cherry juice, cherry pie filling, light wheat, cinnamon and spices.  The taste has a litle bit more wheat and grain and cinnamon, though the cherries is of course the dominant flavor.  This is quite sweet, though never gets cloying.  There is a tart finish with some spice.  Medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation.  Very good beer.  Plus, I got to meet Dan Carey this weekend, and is quite friendly.

4213,"2006-08-10",3.7,"Bottle obtained via trade with moejuck.  Pours hazy, muddy amber and burnt orange with a small and quickly dissipating fizzy white head.  Aroma is sour lemon and cherry, cherry skin, earthy yeast, straw malt, other fruit (apple, apricot, pineapple) and butter.  Initially very sweet cherry syrup and then the tartness rescues you from it taking your mouth to the other extreme and waking all saliva glands at once with a puckering lemon zing.  Sweet malt and trace yeast, cherry skins and buttered bread.  Medium bodied and dry palate.  Not a Top 50 in my ever so humble opinion.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

All sorts of sweet, tart, cherries are in the aroma...even a little bready or doughy smell in there too, prolly due to the belgian yeast or barleys.  Its comparable to a cherry pie in taste and in smell.  The taste also has characteristics of wine like sweetness and a little syrupy element to it also, although its not overdone. Overall this is an excellent beer...its just too bad no one besides people in Wisconsin have access to it.","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"

Very sweet and tangy with flavors of cherries and pineapples, reminded me a lot of a big stick frozen loli pop. A bit of oak and sourness in the finish, but mainly sweet and sour cherries. The color is a unique and murky orange to light brown very pretty but with a tiny orange tan head. A bit to much to be taken by itself... maybe with some cheese or some fruity chicken dish. If you do have it alone, serve in a small champange flute. Way to sweet for me, not having it again.","tijuana, MEXICO","alafito"

Lots of cherries and some vanilla. Flavor was much of the same with some wheaty character behind it all. Lacking the lambic funk I like in beers this fruity, but still rather excellent.

My wife had a sip of this and thought it was outstanding, but doesnt currently drink because she is pregnant.  She said she would really like it though at some other time (very odd as normally she does not like the beers I do).  The flavor is good, albeit slightly cloying.

The aroma holds elements of cherry, vanilla, and oak. The flavor also holds the oak and cherry elements and a breadiness that certainly gives it a cherry pie overall flavor. Sweet and tart(though nowhere near as tart as their Unplugged Cherry Stout) over the tounge with a finsih that reminds me of cider...like an apple-cherry cider. A very unique fruit beer, not too sweet nor sour, would be terrific for after dinner, desset or just to sip on its own.

A pleasant spiciness of autumn apple cider lurks underneath, spiced with orange peel, lemonade, and a pinch of cinnimon.  Some sweet and spicy orange marmalade as well.  A light pastriness reminds me of a delicate, french crepe topped with a mountain of fresh fruit and whipping cream.

Problem is...half way through the bottle and the sweetness overcomes all else...then it becomes cherry soda.  So I wouldnt recommend drinking the whole thing.  Mouthfeel was light and refreshing.

Just like taking a whiff of fresh cherry pie filling with that balance of tart cherry and sweet goopy syrup.  Notes of cherry pits and some yeast as well.  Great sour cherry flavor up front with a smack of tartness in the finish.  The finish also had some chocolaty and fresh oak notes.  Medium bodied with lively carbonation that refreshes the palate after every sip.  This is a truely World Class beer.  I didnt think that this was overly complex, actually I think its rather up front with its beauty.  Though it did become a little more vinous over the 2 hours spent drinking this glass, the first sip revealed its greatness.

Met up with a BA/RB guy from Wisconsin who owns Murrays Wine and Spirits and he brought me 2 each of the Red and Raspberry. Still a beautiful beer, but this time I felt it lacked some of the encompassing malt aspects that worked to contain the fruit aspects. I still love that sparkling pop-rock like tingle it leaves on the tongue. I badly wish this beer were availible here.

Ohh my god that is the best smell in the world. Rich ripe, sweet cherries and cherry puree. It smells like the filling of an expensively made cherry pastry. Its just fantastic smelling thats all that can be said. Faded pink/light red in color with a thin white film of a head. Jeez this brewery makes incredible fruit beers. Fore is full of cherry, spritzy carbonation, mild acidic citric notes toward the finish. The middle has ever so slightly sour notes, some nuttiness and a smooth icing laden fried, flaky sweet dough flavor that carries into the finish. This really is a liquid Cherry Fritter and it is utterly amazing. This is the kind of beer that gets you excited all over again about what beer is and can be.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

Aroma is sweet, full of cherries and some malt.  Not as overwhelming, or spectacular, as the Raspberry tart.  Flavor is tart, sour, a little sweet, but also contains a little bit of malt. Im not a big fruit eater but with the raspberry I thought it was obvious I was drinking raspberries, but these cherries arent as clear cut.  It pours out kind of grapefruity pink with a rapidly disappering light pink head.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, not syrupy.  Whereas the 25 oz of raspberry was not enough for me, I think that 25 oz of this is more than sufficient.  A very well manufactured beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"

The palate is wonderful, with lush flavors of tart cherry, sweet cherry, and just enough malt back bone to support the cherry flavor. Belgian Red finishes with more tart cherry flavors up front, then ends with a very refreshing and delicious, sweet/tart cherry flavor that lingers.

Belgian Red pours a murky bright red and the cherry aroma hits you like a truck fresh from the orchard.  Awesome.  This is thick, like an imperial stout almost, but the taste is straight sour cherries with some malt thrown in for good measure.  Tastes like a cherry pie.  It only gets better as it warms.  Aftertaste is the same as the first swallow, pure cherry pie.  Best consumed in small doses, however, this is some rich beer that might lead to gut-rot if youre not careful.

Pours a super murky dank brown red, with lots of speckling and yummy sedimenty unfiltered goodness. NG filters most of their beers, so I was pleasantly surprised. Aroma is cherries (of course), along with a dash of brown sugar and some yeast. No hops detected on this one. Taste is where this one is lacking. I do not find enough complexity to warrant a top 50 beer, or even top 100 in my opinion. What you do get, is an initial blast of tart citric cherries. I do admit, the cherry flavor, although potent, is very natural in every way. Initially sour, but a nice malt profile backs it up to provide a backbone with some sweetness and girth. Yet the cherries are too overpowering on this one. Even the sensibly nice malts are over muscled by a strong cherry presence. Not sure what to recommend to make this one better, but there are better Krieks out there. Maybe I am jaded to the top 50, but my last few samplings have left things to be desired. Too much carbonation.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"

Its not overly sweet (at least to me), with a pronounced tart cherry finish.  Im not sure if I would call it balanced, as it was hard to distinguish either malt or hop.

The nose is somewhat like a cherry pie, just not as sweet.  It was sweet, sour and tart all at the same time.  The taste was really nice.  Cherries were the main component.

4213,"2005-12-10",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2007 750 ml bottle
This is a revisit of an early rating that was really lacking.  I am actually amazed it took this long but with something so plentiful as Belgian Red, there were always other things to try.  This is New Glarus flagship beer for a reason - it is excellent in all aspects.  If you need a good gateway beer, get a bottle and share it.  Just stock up next time you drive through Wisconsin.

Aroma / Appearance - There was the obvious scent of tart cherry but along with it were doughy notes, as if someone had melted down a fresh hot cherry pie.  I also got some background scents that reminded me of the smell of a fresh paperback novel.  The body is a deep mahogany that leaves thin trails of clear lacing.  The initial pour gave a pink head, which reminded me of the fizz from Cherry 7UP.

Flavor / Palate - This is where the beer truly shines.  Several beers have a pleasant nose, but then follow it up with a taste that is either too one-dimensional or too mouth puckering sweet.  This one is just as it advertises.  It tastes like liquid cherry pie, hot from the oven with a dash of sugar glaze on top.  It is slightly sweet but a nice tartness balances that well.  Hiddden in the background are very faint peach notes which last for only a second before the cherry takes over again.  If it were just a cherry beer this would be a 3 at best.  It is the additional complexity which makes this one shine above the others.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The cherry smell is of cherries with distinct cherry overtones highlighted by cherry undertones.

Shares many characteristics with New Glarus Raspberry tart -- lively natural carbonation, predominant tart fruit character both in aroma and flavor (though obviously cherry versus raspberry), excellent integration of fruit and beer rather than just ""beer with fruit flavor thrown in,"" smooth lively creamy palate, and exceptional overall craftsmanship. The Belgian Red has a more pleasant appearance (less muddy); and while the Raspberry Tart almost pushes the ""tart"" boundry too far, the Belgian Red strikes an absolutely perfect balance. Yes, this beer lives up to the hype, and at $7 per 750ml bottle, its the best quality-per-dollar beer on the market, bar none. Next time you find yourself in the southern half of Wisconsin, go out of your way to find a quality liquor store that carries it. You will not be disappointed.

<P>On a side note, I notice the notes at the top of the page state that this beer is commonly on tap. After 10-plus years of Wisconsin pubcrawling (some of those years as an actual Wisconsin resident), I cannot recall ever seeing it on tap. If anyone knows of a place that regularly carries this on tap, please PM me. Thanks.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Aromas are of amazing sweet cherries with notes hinting at tartness as well, some cider notes and wheat as well.  Flavor is tart cherries, white sugar, and cider characteristics.  Mouthfeel is extermely lively, lots of tickling and popping.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","Brad"
4213,"2005-08-27",3.6,"Muddy copper pour with no head.  The aroma  is overly sweet, mostly cherry juice and pressed cherry with lots of sugar.  The body is lively, sweet, but not too puckering.  Slightly sticky texture.  The freshness is top notch, but unless you REALLY like cherries, this will get old fast.  I appreciate what theyve done, but the cherries absolutely dominate the brew and leave room for little else.  It would be nice to have some balance here as this comes off as a one trick pony in the end.  Cant fruit beers have some complexity??  I want to taste the effects of the oak aging damnit!  I would much rather have a 12 oz bottle of this, as the 1 pint, 9 fl. oz. bottle is nearly impossible to finish alone...","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Viscous rise of rich cherries: black, rainier, michigan, and marachino. Flavor starts with a very candied cherry flavor, but then melds into a sweet Abbey-like molasses, gingered brandy and cream. Reminds of entering a bakery run by Monks. Finish is a lingering dabble of peaches and more cherries. Very carbonated. Intense. Light alcohol notes and a tinge of champagne.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Im not sure if it was on cask, but the flavors, particularly the spices of cardamom and clove came out nicely at Great Taste. The bottled version last night was good, but nothing like the tap/cask.

4213,"2005-08-08",4.3,"Big thanks to BBB63 for this.  the color is a cloudy rusty red, with a dense foamy light tan head that goes quickly.  aroma is cherries sauteed in a turbinado demi-glaze.  faint yeastiness and tartness in the aroma too.  pretty high carbonation.  flavor is sweet dried cherries, quite like ones Ive had from Michigan,  and more flavors like the aroma.  also tastes like the cherry shish kabobs that I had at a restaurant called the Persian Grill in Phila PA about ten years ago.  the tartness in the finish is very well placed and refreshing.  the aftertaste is very clean.  lacing appears at each sip, making wild island like patterns.  was there alcohol?  I drank the whole bottle fairly fast and didnt feel it much.  I could tell this was a beer, but didnt get much malt or hops.  went well with roasted walnuts, but this would go great with a lot of things.  this is an UBER KREIK!  thanks again, BBB63!!","Brooklyn, New York, USA","MullMan"

Flavor is a *lot* of tart, fresh cherries well balanced by the spiciness of the hops and smooth malt.  Creamy, medium bodied with good, lively carbonation for this type of beer.  Wonderful cherry preserves finish just completes this terrific beer.

Very lively on the tongue and it leaves you with a sour cherry taste that is vey refreshing. It is beleivable that there is more than a pound of cherry in each bottle.

4213,"2005-07-17",4.3,"750ml bottle: As is the case with almost any tasting, I find myself being a very tough critic when there are so many great beers in one place.  Inevitably one or two beers will separate themselves from the pack at some point.  This was my favorite of the Its no Montreal tasting.  Cherry tinged brownish amber body with a large white head.  The nose is just full of fresh cherries and spices, with a tiny hint of sweet wheat and malt in the background.  The flavor just blew me away.  There fresh cherries, cherry pie, spices, cream, and some nice wood flavors that dont get in the way.  I actually wrote not overpowering cherry pie twice in my tasting notes.  Medium bodied, lively carbonation that just feels right to my palate.  Wonderfully balanced between sweet cherries, spice(hops?) and a bit of sourness.

4213,"2005-07-01",4.3,"Bottle thanks to BierBauch.  Pour is a murky red/brown color.  Aroma opens up to a cider cherry smell.  Something similar to cherry pie filling, but with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.    Flavor is something else.  It really caought me off gaurd.  It first smelled a little vinegar like when I cracked it open, but after a pour it changed.  The flavor is a lot like that.  It really came off bitter and tart at first.  Then I got more cherry sweetness and some of nice wooden smoothness towards the end.

It was a bit on the malty side taste-wise and definately closer to ""beer"" as far as taste than the New Glarus Raspberry Tart I had before this one.

Other than a few unrated tastes later in the evening, this is as far as I got.  My wife took the notes on this one (as I was occupied with tommee).  I will say that (as I recall) this was less powerful fruit (only relative to raspberry tart) and more tart.  This is not to say it was less flavorful.  I thought the flavor of this one was also excellent.  My wife noted that cherry was the dominate fruit flavor in this one (what a surprise).

Beautiful peach head that unfortunately dissipates within 45 seconds -- however, I wont slight it for this because with this type of beer it would be expected that fruity acidity will cut down the head; in any case theres plenty of spotty lacing with each sip. Aroma is commendable: about 40% sweet cherry but also about 30% hops and 30% grain. Taste is very complex, with tart cherry at the base but also presenting other elements including Hungarian paprika, apple cider with a cinnamon stick, Lipton tea and a touch of hops. Finish shows a mellowness and has a raisin tinge totally unlike the perhaps too bold tartness in the mouth.

The smoky red color intrigues the drinker as the beer exits the bottle, the light head lives for a good bit, and a fair speckling of lacing appears.  The smell is sweet and tart, just like fresh cherries.  The taste is not as sweet as I would have imagined.  Tart sensations light up the tongue, and the beer sits firm in the mouth.  Roasted grains bring the sweet and tart cherries into check.   Best enjoyed in small quantities after a hearty meal.  A great price for such a great dessert beer!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","Gurst"

4213,"2004-12-31",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2005 2004 bottle thanks to Footbalm and Flemdawg.  Tried side-by-side with a 2003 Cantillon Kriek.  Needless to say, this one didnt quite come out on top, but for what it was, I was very pleased.  Especially after drinking the vastly unbalanced and cloying Raspberry tart.  Wonderful pour, murky, muddled dark red and burgundy with browns and tans swriling about.  Cloudy, unfiltered and bottle conditioned.  Aroma of tart, fresh cherries, moderate sweetness with some wheat and a light yeast influence.  Flavor opens up with a burst of ripe cherries followed quickly by a touch of lightly tart yeast.  Hops add a touch of balance, and while the cherries do not quite overwhelm with sweetness, there is no want of sugar, fruit and sweet malt here.  What I could use more of, is the wonderful tart lambic flavor hiding in the background.  On the finish, some hops are evident, earthy, lightly sharp, rusty and old, with a good dose of wheat and yeast, but it is not quite enough to stop the cherries.  I like what New Glarus is doing; these beers are fresh and wonderfully crafted, but they need to tone down the fruit, at least in my opinion.  Only traces of sourness or oak can be felt, while there is a touch of oily roast on the very end, the cherry tartness and meaty pulpiness of it really overshadows everything.  A good beer and one that would age well.  I do need to try some extensively aged samples of this (and the raspberry) before passing a final judgement, but for now it is too sweet and only adds yeast tartness/sourness as an afterthought.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4213,"2004-12-28",3.7,"Again I must thank Clark for bringing this in.  This beer pours more of an auburn in color tan a red (which youd expect from a beer with cherries on the label) and an whitish head.  The aroma is all cherry ""fruit roll up"" as one taster put it, and a slight tartness.  The flavor is very sweet, little to no malt flavor, and then some tartness.  This has some body to it but there is a little harshness in the finish.  Overall for a Belgian style it is extremely drinkable, if you like sweet beers.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","redmosquito"

4213,"2004-12-01",4.2,"Well,  Im a bit surprised with this but looking at the top beers in this category (fruit beer) the number 2 and 3 beers are both New Glarus, the #1 being this bad boy. Perhaps this shouldnt be such a surprise after tasting 2 out of the 3, both being phenomenal. As with the raspberry tart, one of the big defining characteristics of this beer is the absolute authenticity of the fruit. The description says over a pound of cherries is in each bottle, and despite earlier skepticism, I believe it now. The beer is intensely fogged, no doubt from all the organic residue. Full aroma of cherry followed with equally intense flavor; Flemish flair - medium tartness keeps the palate interesting but doesnt really interfere with the flavor (I let this one sit for a year so perhaps it mellowed out a bit though). Something that may be startling out of context is the slight chalkiness in the palate - just a litle residue from the tartness that gives it a slightly chewy aspect, nice and full.

Color is a rich, ripe, bright cherry red, with a short and soon departed head. Aroma is in a class of its own: absolutely gorgeous! Rich, delicious, vinous, sweet, and sour, the perfect picture of cherries! Its utterly wonderful, and a joy to drink in deep with the nose! 
On the palate, other tranformations occur: WOW! Dazzling, uplifting, and lovely! By tranformative, I mean that something new occurs in me, I am 100% happier by drinking this elixir, my mood is elevated, every atom has an energized attitude!
Several waves of sensation occur throughout the consumption of this ale, it jumps and jiggers in the mouth, surges in and sallies out. The taste continues, and the feeling wells up in and rides over every square inch of the body that is apt to perceive sensation! Finish is a bit tartish, but what do you want, its cherries, man!

New Glarus beers absolutely rule.  This one poured ruby red with a big, fluffy, pink head.  Aroma of big cherries, slight hops and malt.  Tastes incredible, with a great cherry flavor backed up by a solid malt backbone and some great layered finishing hops and tartness.  Finishes medium bodied, slightly tart.  The hand-poured wax on the bottle is a nice touch, also.  This beer just screams quality, complexity, and balance.  It isnt some gimmicky crap, either.

The pour is a dark amber, it looks like strong iced tea. There is a head that quickly fades into a ring around the flute. The nose is of cherry pie without the buttery crust smell. The taste is strong of (of course) cherry, with secondary notes of carbonation and a little malt. It took me awhile to put my finger on it, but I can describe the cherry taste and smell perfectly: it smells/tastes like canned cherry pie filling, or fried cherry pie (if you are from the south you know what I mean).

In the glass it was a dark and cloudy red and the mouthfeel was silky smooth with bubbles providing some punctuation. This is quite apart from the light feel and look of other fruit beers Ive had.  There is a super-real cherry taste that is much more complicated than the ""cherry soda"" comments would suggest and quite different than eating a ""fresh cherry.""  The cherry is embedded in a mature maltiness and yeastiness.  The hops cut the sweetness at just the right place.  There is a lingering cherry complexity in the nose that is very satisfying.

A sweet full cherry flavor dominates the nose, notes of vanilla and sour cherry.  No surprise, this beer has a sweet full flavored cherry taste.  This beer is by no means traditional, but it is at least cherry sweet and not sugary sweet.  This does not approach the complexity of a Flemish sour or a Lambic, but it is a well made exploding celebration of the cherry.  This is a perfect after dinner/ desert beer.

The beer itself is quite sweet and refreshing, though reasonably viscous with a medium body.  As a beer I might not have to much respect for this one, but it is damn tasty and a perfect desert beer.  Has a sour, tart, fruity, tannic-cherry stone thing going on.  The aroma is so intensely cherry, it is quite wonderful.  I am gonna have to say that this would be much better, more authentic, if they had used a beer such as La Folie as the base beer.  I really cant get over how intense the  cherry flavor and aroma are.  This is certainly quite an experience.

4213,"2004-04-23",4.7,"Maybe I'm biased, but there is nothing like this beer. It is most enjoyable in the cold of a Minnesota winter and drunk from a snifter or wine goblet. The cherry content is rich and tart, but finishes a bit on the sweet side. New Glarus is not known for its hoppiness which makes the brazen cherriness of the beer so much more intense. If you can, go to this Swiss village in Wisconsin on a Saturday, take a tour of the facility, sample the wares and buy a bunch of stuff. Afterward, go to the hotel that is on the other side of the road and down about half a mile, and try some Swiss cuisine.","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","RugbyMike"
4213,"2004-04-22",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2005 Cloudy red plum color and tight fizzy champagne-like head that faded fast. Musty, fermented cherry aroma. Complex flavor of dark ripe cherries. Sour and acidic but not mouth-puckering, moderately sweet, and some nice bitterness. Oak comes through in the flavor. Has some tannic qualities as well. Better than New Belgium La Folie, this is a terrific concoction. Thanks CaptainCougar.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
4213,"2004-04-16",4.0,"Beautiful cherry red in colour.  Aroma of light malt, cherries and its rather sweet.  Flavour is tart and sour but just the right amount, cherries coated in sugar and sprinkled with cinnamon.  Medium body, slightly syrupy texture.  Finishes long, really sweet with cherries.  Not as good at the Rodenbach Grand Cru.  Thanks for sharing your bottle with me Steve.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
4213,"2004-04-16",4.3,"It's like someone baked a cherry pie but instead of adding bags of sugar they added subtle touches of tart vinegar. Rich ruby reddish brown colour with a thin off-white head. Aromas of cherry are expected, but so too are there some spices and maltiness. Flavour dances across all sections of your tongue tantalizing and assaulting each taste bud as it goes. Not an overpowering assault though - more like an ongoing lingering and very welcome attack. Finishes long and mildly tart. If anythig the lack of acidity or edge is the only drawback. Not as sour as I would like in a sour ale, but still a fantastic beer. Much thanks to joeybgood for this one.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
4213,"2004-04-15",4.4,"Foggy and dark ruby-red. Sweet, maraschino cherry nose. Soft, mildly carbonated, and sugary texture. I smelled cherries, but I tasted dried apricots all over the place, lingering long in the cheeks. Sweet malts (cake) and a very, very mild bitterness. Hint of tartness ... and even a touch of a cinnamon-like aroma. Overall, somewhat reminiscent of Transatlantique, but New Glarus is sweeter and heavier. Other than being just a little too sweet, it's a really fine beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

4213,"2004-04-04",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2005 Woh! Impressive appearance. Muddy reddish brown with pink hints, but most of all: a monstruous cloud (darker than the rest of the pour) stalls scarily in suspension in my glass. Superior head, white, very sticky and foamy. Stellar visual. Ill be damned if this doesnt smell quite as good as the raspberry tart, of course both are very similar besides being made from distinct fruits. Pure cherry pie made of pure fresh cherries. Moreover, this is a childrens puree, cherry flavoured, this stuff used to be good, admit it, we had some all over our clothes when we used to eat the stuff. Decadent dessert material, fresh, lovely, crisp, sweet, superb focus, chocolatey, caramelic.  Barry: ""Oh my god, oh my god""  Martin: ""Im gonna try and find some defaults for you""  Well this is very sweet, but damn, one cant help but enjoy it and in fact, anyone who hates beer would love it. Just decadent pie flavor with restrained oakiness. My only complaint (severe judging) is that the acidity could be more pronounced as this is extremely sweet. It tasted like it was baked.. spicy with vanilla notes. And a ""wow"" creamy velvety body with a surprisingly above average carbonation, biting actually. Legendary beer from the worlds best non-lambic fruit flavored beers  brewer hands down. Thanks again Nexxus.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Revisiting this beer think that my initial exhuberence was a bit high. The flavor is totally cherry some light wheaty malt, but mainly cherry. I want to like it but it somehow does not mesh. It is too disjoint for me. The flavors are good but the sum is less than the parts.  Old Rating 8/4/8/3/17 - 4.0 Very nice red body with a lovely, creamy, rocky, red hued head that clings to the glass in great sheets. The aroma of cherries is evident the minute the cap is popped. The flavor is extraordinary, cherries are dominatn at first then a new level of complexity opens up as sweet malt and even some hops. The body is medium and quite lively with a very strong cherry aftertaste that manages to not where out its welcome or become cloying. A very unique and very good beer.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

Poured a cloudy amber with an almost red-orange hue. Very small head which dissappated repidly and no lacing.
Aroma was totally cherries. Definitely doesn't taste like beer. More like a champaign. The flavor was similar to what you might expect from a belgian white with lots of cherries tossed in. Reminded me of a tart cherry pie with good carbonation.
Not for an everyday beer, but for dessert on special occasions this would be a good choice.","Oroville, California, USA","celogan"
4213,"2004-03-23",4.3,"Although not a Flemish sour in the traditional sense, this ber is outstanding.  An amazing white with pink hued head and a light red/almost fuscia color lead to a cherry explosion on the first sip.  Very fine champaign like bubble lend a tingle to the exerience.

I DREAM about this beer...And the reality is better.  A true fruit ale hand-crafted in small batches from premium ingredients by a family brewery.  The perfect, PERFECT balance of tartness and sweetness, with a slightly nutty aftertaste and an unbelievably smooth texture and robust color. Halfway between wine and beer and far better than either, with.  Whatever you have to do to get your hands on a bottle or three of this delectable beverage, DO IT.  You will NOT be disappointed.

 Well smack my ass and call me Sally, this was one of the most delicious dessert  beers I have ever had, and my girlfriend says Belgian Red it is now her Favorite beer of all time, but the single 750ml bottle was not enough for her. 
 Pours with a pale and foggy mahogany and crimson body, then amassing a frothy cloud with a sailors red sky delight behind it. -   The aroma is so enticingly delicious that it is almost discussing. Jars of syrupy Maraschino Cherry’s and cinnamon fill the aroma. The use of a caramel malt brings it’s likeness as well as notes of vanilla to the sautéed to caramelized cherries. This beer has the most amazing tart bitter / sweet flavor, and woody oak company make this very much a Flemish Sour, but more of a syrupy sweetness here of a fruit beer. Spices to know end .. cinnamon …clove, sage, and some apple blossoms. Notes of apple ring out beside the cherries, as well as a yeasty, and toasty beady crust similarity. A light, sticky effervescence adjacent to the fresh tart country cheery pie make this a welcome treat for most any special occasion!

Strong, sweet cherry flavor with a slight sourness and tickling carbonation.  Has a wine/champagne twist to it.  An excellent, unique, absolutely delicious beer.  The key is that the beer beneath all of the fruit is well-made, creamy, and could probably stand on its own, just like the beer beneath the Raspberry Tart.","California, USA","tomxcs"

4213,"2004-01-02",4.6,"11/12/03.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, enjoyed in a tasting at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA 11/12/03.  Whispy white head, edges of light tannish-pink.  Opaque, pink amber body.  Nice appearance, but that's not the incredible thing about this beer-- the nose is simply one of the best aromas I've ever had the pleasure to smell.  If it were socially acceptable, I'd just sit around all night taking this beer in through the nose!  Cherry pie.  Very rich cherry and some tart cranberry in the nose, but mostly just soft, decadent cherry pie with wonderful strength and warmth.  Flavor is tart cherry again, like a pie (someone said McDonald's cherry pie, but I can't be sure since I've never had it-- still, it sounded like a compliment coming from that guy).  Flavor is slightly bready, full-on pie giving you a bit of the crust.  Finish is very, very smooth but not quite long enough.  Fantastic while it's there, but not quite enough to push it over the top.  The aroma makes this beer, and everything else is just a pleasureful accompaniment to that outstanding start.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Yeah, right.  I over got my cold and thought, ""Tonight's the night!""  Pours a fine, small head, with continuing effervesence in the smallest bubbles I've ever seen.  Looks like cherry juice; nothing spectacular.  Smells. . .like cherry mountain pie on a cold night/huddled 'round a fire/home-canned bing cherries/and a dollop of sugar.  Also smells faintly woody (campfire), vanilla ice cream (from the camp store), and a bit medicinal (Mom, I scraped my knee).  Now that smelling this has caused me to relive portions of my childhood, I drink.  Light in the mouth, but not too fizzily aggressive.  Bursts of cherriness batter my brain.  Little malt detectable.  Finish is slightly spicy and quite tart.  Leaves a stickiness but no sweetness 'round my lips.  This is truly remarkable but too much for my brain to handle tonight.

4213,"2003-11-04",4.5,"Never had anything like this before. I was given a free glass by the bartender of a local resteurant who knows that I am keen on unique brews. Its sells for $17 a bottle at this place (champagne sized bottle). It does not really taste like a beer or barley wine, or like a wine either. I think its a one-of-a-kind type of brew. The aroma was like a cherry liqour, red-brown color, good carbonation. The taste of cherries was prominant, but without the usual sweetness that one would associate with cherries. Its tough to describe in beer terms because its not really a beer. The 1-year aging is probably a major contributor to the taste. If I had something to celebrate, Id buy it - but $17 a bottle is a bit pricey. It would be nice if they could increase the alchohol content... I dont think there is another ""beer"" on the planet that costs as much but only brags 5% ABV (I know, alchohol content is not supposed to be a major deal with the ratings - lol).","Ixonia, Wisconsin, USA","djmcfar"

This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized slightly purplish hazy colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing.  There was a grainy sediment to it that was visibly suspended within it.  It had a strong cherry aroma and a bubbly sour cherry mouthfeel.  The flavor was once again fruity.  Another very nice brew, a bit sour, but then I think it was supposed to be that way hehe.

My favorite beer at the Fort Wayne tasting.  Poured cloudy orange-red-brown, with an off-white head.  Three distinct aromas: cherry, cherry, and cherry.  Flavor was dominated, as expected, by these very cherries, although the fruitiness was nicely balanced by cinnamon and woodiness.  The palate was remarkable- this is the smoothest fruit beer (OK- I see this is a Flemish Sour...) Ive tried, and the carbonation perfectly complemented the slightly sour, spicy flavor.  Remarkable.

4213,"2003-07-13",4.3,"Bottle.  Dark cloudy reddish brown color (almost like homemade cider) with a creamy light brown and pink head.  The aroma is wonderful with apples, cinnamon, and sweet cherries.  I was satisfied just to keep taking in the aroma.  It starts with a tart tingle on the tongue and is soon followed by the highly sweet and sour cherry.  Finishing with a cinnamon and cherry aftertaste, this beer a true joy.  Not as full and malty as I remember the Rodenbach beers.  Thanks to my friend Todd for sending this to me from Wisconsin.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
4213,"2003-07-09",3.8,"Dullish red pour with an intense pink head. Tart nose to match the flavor. Glad this was able to avoid being to soda-ish. Nice summer brew but more than one could be a bit much.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
4213,"2003-07-08",4.6,"color is a dull brick-red with a certain ""greyish"" quality to it...i know that doesnt make any sense, but tough luck, this is MY rating! very much an earthy quality to it. most excellent tart nose to it...s wonderful cherry/lemon mixture..also, i get kind of a heavy cheese nose to it as well. that wonderful cheesy/tartness also exists in the flavor. the excellent tartness remains on your cheeks for quite some time! this is truly a wonder ale and probably one of the biggest surprise beers to date for me!. all the wonderful tartness without all the cloying sweetness.","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"

4213,"2003-07-02",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2003 Bright red, cloudy with small off-white head.  Aroma is cherry, sweet with a hint of sourness.  Taste is sweet up top, and sour cherry mid-tongue.  Medium/full body.  Somehow it avoids the cherry soda experience and gives you something wonderful.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
4213,"2003-07-01",4.4,"Big cherry aroma, hazy reddish colour, with a large pink head, plenty of lace. As true a cherry flavour a beer could have! Tart, acidic, wonderfully dry finish, yet very refreshing. Delicious, Sensational!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
4213,"2003-06-30",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2004 Wow, this is great. I tend to enjoy the fruity-ish kind of stuff but this is by far the best that I have had. Cool pour and colour, the palate is smoothe yet tangy. After a couple of these it can get a little sweet. But overall a great beer.

EDIT: 7/26/2003, I went to my favorite bar (Boltini) where I normally purchase this stuff and the bartender told me that this beer is NO LONGER BEING DISTRIBUTED. Apparently this stuff is doing so well that they have decided to limit production and distribution OR they are going to start mass producing the stuff.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
4213,"2003-06-30",4.3,"Aroma of sweet cherry pie. Pours a cloudy red-pink, carbonation is high. The flavour and palate are nothing less than spectacular. Lovely sweet cherry taste.

4213,"2003-06-30",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2004 Awesome.  Cloudy brownish red.  Minimal head.  Delicious cherry flavour with a cidery edge.  Sour and delicious.  Very short finish.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
4213,"2003-06-28",4.1,"Slightly pinkish head, that is mostly diminishing.  Deep ruby color.  Hazy.  Rich cherry aroma.  A little yeasty.  Cherry packed punch, fairly sweet, but not overdone.  The mouthfeel suggests more carbonation than is visible.  This is a tasty concoction.  However, the style must be a varied one, because New Belgium La Folie is the same style but fairly different.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
4213,"2003-06-28",4.6,"Poured a huge white head in a tulip glass and a cloudy red appearance. The aroma is incredible. A big bouquet of cherries. Initial sips were a pleasant sweet and sour, not overdone either way. Well carbonated. A nice offering from New Glarus.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"
4213,"2003-06-24",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2004 the bottle itself is awesome with the bottle dipped in red wax covering the cap and neck. Very cool. Then the color is very gem-like when put up to the light, glowing with reddish, pinky/orange thats slightly opaque with a very unique pinkish/orangy head of light bubbly froth, with some large bubbles, and poured out to be about two inches high and settled down to a small bubbly froth with some curtain-like lacing of tiny-tight bubbles. 
Smells of nice fruity tart cherries and a bit sour, like a lemonade.
Taste is a heavenly nice sweetly sour and tart cherry thats easily smooth and a bit like a fruit juice or wine cooler but much nicer flavor. It's medium body and generously carbonated with a huge sweet feel in the front, then just lays down smooth and slightly drying to the finish leaving a great sour tart bite in the back of my mouth. Take a cherry lambic and lighten it up a bit and here ya go, a very interestingly, very drinkable treat of yumminess.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
4213,"2003-06-15",4.1,"Deep, deep red with a nice pinkish and persistenct head. Intitial sourness takes you by surprise every time you drink it.

4213,"2003-06-08",3.9,"Finally broke down and bought a bottle to share with some friends.  Even my wife, who doesn't like cherries enjoyed this brew.  The cherry flavor and aroma are not overdone and the carbonation is excellent.  The bottle was open for half an hur and every pour was like the bottle was just opened.  The background is a belgian beer and the foreground is a freshly opened cherry 7up.  One of a kind brew that we will purchase on rare occasions.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"

Rivals all the great fruit beers I've had in Belgium (exc. Rodenbach), but I simply do not have great affection for the style.  I'd rather have a good Pils.  An interesting pick for #500.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
4213,"2003-05-24",4.1,"A very good sipping beer, sour, tart and plenty of cherries, although they taste a little more like maraschino's than fresh cherries.

4213,"2003-05-24",4.0,"I have to agree on the ""girly beer"" comment, but this is the most unique beer experience I've had in a while.  I suppose the closest beer to compare it to would be quelque chose, but this beer is a bit more ""extreme.""  It smells and tastes like they made those sour cherry gummy candies into a beer.  This beer has a lot of fizz, which works with the sour aspects of the beer to get the salivary glands working, which in turn causes you to pick up the intense, sweet cherry flavor that is hiding behind the sourness.  All of the elements of the beer encourage slow sipping, so I think it should have a higher alcohol content, but that's my only complaint.  If you are looking for something new and different, this is the place to go.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4213,"2003-05-23",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2005 Yep, liked it. Extremely fresh. Soft texture, with a wonderfully lightly tart, soft, natural cherry sourness. Never candyish, always natural (except the aroma kinda smelled like lollypops or soemthing). Mix the cherrys in with some light oak and mayne some nuttyness. If i had one complaint it would be that its not assertive enough (more sour, more stink), but hey, the balance couldnt really be any better right? Glad to share this with Ecz and Motelpogo. Re-rate: Lots o marzipan in the aroma, and i take away the thing about the lollypops in the aroma, this is just a wonderful beer, perfectly balanced between sweet and tart. Yummy.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
4213,"2003-05-22",4.7,"ok this is a bit of a girly beer but what a girly beer. it's got all the friendly, sweet, vanilla, almonds and juicy cherries from a classy non-confected kriek ilke cantillon or girardin, just minus the odeur de homeless people, gut-assaulting sourness and all the rest of it. it's not especially complex - it's a very simple, amazingly vivid, fresh, nectary, smooth and aromatic cherry flavour. The aroma is pure marzipan. I could feel this stuff going all the way down to my bierbauch and leaving a coating of almond oil the whole way. woah. sloppy kisses to duff for letting me and mpog share it.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
4213,"2003-05-18",2.9,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2003 I think I got some overripe cherries in mine, because it tasted, well, like an overripe sweet cherry.  Lindeman's Kriek was waaay better.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
4213,"2003-05-11",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2003 Red-brown color with a nice head. Lots of carbonation (like champaign). The aroma is pure delight, cherries step to the forefront. The cherry tartness slaps you across the face but then mellows out to sweet-sour balance. This beer is not sugary sweet and bland like some cherry beers. Among the very best in it genre into the world, many Belgium breweries wish their Krieks were this good.

4213,"2003-03-10",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2005 This was definitely the wildest and most interesting drink of the entire Belgian Beer Fest. Simply entrancing that something so dull looking could turn into a marvelous spectacle in the mouth. It pours a deep ruby red with a lucious thin red head...nice cloudy amber appearance. The aroma is total cherries! Cherry pie, cherry soda, cherry everthing. The taste dances around the wildest creations known to man!!! Apple tart, Cherry pie, cherry coke, sour, sweet, lambicy....crap...im getting dizzy just writing about this delectable creation. Perfectly carbonation and tongue tickling...right in the middle with the cherries and on the sides with the tart...wow!...Someone get me more now!!!!

4213,"2003-03-09",4.7,"Lest I go into a long discussion of my childhood love affair with cherries, I will just say that I was so impressed with this that it defies words perhaps...I can taste the cherries as they grow, from the really sour phase to the just right...to the sweetness that comes when the cherries are mixed with sugar and baked in a yeasty dough. Beautiful color and just very fresh tasting, love the fact that local products are used. I'd love to serve this for guests at a party sometime.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"

4213,"2003-02-24",4.2,"Score is high due to intense enjoyment. For me, this beer is simple but delicious. Poured a hazy strawberry red with a thick reddish-white head that subsided to a thin layer. Aroma of sour cherries and sweetness. Flavor dominated by sour cherries, sweetness, and followed by a fizzy tartness. The sourness, cherries, tartness, acidity, and lively carbonation are very well balanced. I didn't detect the malt or wheat, but as I view this as a tasty fruit beer, I rate it accordingly.","San Diego, California, USA","rodolito"
4213,"2003-02-18",3.5,"I can't figure this one out, maybe because I'm a stark raving novice to the style.  I get the cherry thing - it's pretty explosive and very good, far from the cheap artificiality of so many fruit beers.  I even get some honestly spicy hops.  But my humble beer buds quest for more and lurking in the murk behind the cherry and sparkle find barely enough malt to keep me interested.  Should I not be searching for a malt backbone?  Do I care?  I think the stuff is gorgeous, but not enough of the good nuttier, spicier, and just downright earthier flavors rise through to make it a world class quaffer for me.  The malt has been yeast squeezed to yield up its sour breath in harmony to cherry pucker, and what is left, good stuff mind you, whimpers a little limply in the background.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"

4213,"2003-02-15",4.9,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2009 This is the beer you get for Valentines day for your worse-half so you do not have to drink champaign.  However when you pour this in a wine glass it has the hazy red color of the juice from a cherry pie that has spread onto the pie plate to cover where the missing pieces of pie were.  There is very little head, but what head there is, is fizzy.  The taste, oh the taste is like fresh tart sour cherry pie. This is not sweet cherry like cough drops or maraschino cherries or those horrid chocolate covered cherries.  This is lip puckering, lip smacking, tongue wagging sour cherries.  Not a session ale, but for those special occasions.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

4213,"2003-02-07",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2006 Sick looking beer, kind of like watered down blood. Huge cherry aromas. I think I came into this expecting something huge and cloying, but I was pleasantly surprised. The sweetness and the tartness are well balanced, providing for a very refreshing fruit beer. The oak comes through nicely to help dry it all out and provide an earthy counterpoint to the huge fruitiness.

But it sure is tasty.  Thanks hey_kevin!","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
4213,"2003-01-26",3.2,"Head is initially small, fizzy, off-white, fully diminishing. Body is murky dark red. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted light bread), with a strong note of cherry. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Medium body, syrupy texture, lively carbonation. Very sweet...my girlfriend would love this.  Enough tartness to keep it from being a total wash, though, and the aroma is strong with fresh cherry.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

4213,"2003-01-02",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2011 Ok, I enjoyed another bottle tonight with the wife. We both agree that the aroma is of cherries, butter and brown sugar... quite simply, homemade cherry pie. The flavor is of cherry pie as well; slightly salty crust and all.

I was not to be disappointed when I tasted it.  First, there's wax over the bottlecap, which is a classy touch.  The beer is world class.  Tastes as though a barrelful of cherries is in each bottle - the brewery must have spared no expense.  Sweet like cherry pie, yet with tartness.  Delectably delicious.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
4213,"2002-12-18",3.9,"Aroma of cherry pie,  straight from the oven and cooling on the proverbial windowsill.  Fetching opaque brownish red in color with a bit of pink showing around the edges and a slight head with very fine carbonation.  Tart and somewhat sweet, fruity flavor profile, cherry juice being apparent throughout all phases.  Some spices come out of hiding once the beer warms a bit, but overall the tart and sweet cherry and faint maltiness (a bit of wheat as well) serve as the focus.  Finish is very lengthy.  After my first couple of sips, I wasnt so sure this was the masterpiece its renown seems to indicate, but after a little while I really started enjoying it.  Not quite as complex as some of the Belgian beers of this style Ive sampled, and a 750 really  is quite a lot to drink by yourself.  Overall, however, I appreciated it, and Ive definitely never had anything quite like it.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Tart flavor loaded with a cherry pie filling, only crisper.  Syrypy sweet.  Very wine like brew.  Tart and sweet, a nice way to mix it up.  My buddy had a chocolate covered cherry made with half this stuff and half Guinness draught.  I can only imagine how it would be if made with a Rogue Chocolate Stout.  Intense bier with some oaken notes on the finish and a smooth, but really fizzy mouthfeel.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"

4213,"2002-12-06",4.3,"I like this beer.  It was the most different brew that Ive ever had.  Very strong cherry taste and aroma.  Hints of malt and not a trace of hops.  Great brew to have at the end of an evening,with or in lieu of a desert.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
4213,"2002-11-19",3.8,"Dark cherry red color.  Well, pretty much like a cherry ginger ale.  Its really more sweet than tart or sour, which makes it much more easy to drink.

4213,"2002-11-05",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2004 My original rating of 3.1 is far too harsh.  After additional samplings of this tasty, tasy beer, I've decided to up my rating of it.  Sure there's a ton of fruit, but there's a ton of fruit in many of the beers in this style.  This is just so good, I can't be so harsh.  It's wrong.  Wow.  What to say about this beer?  Well, a nice red-brown color with almost no head.  My initial thought when smelling the beer was of cherry fruittape.  Sort of like fruit roll-ups, but made with real fruit.  The ""health"" food alternative.  Someone also said to me cherry koolaid powder, no water.  Either way, cherries like a kick in the crotch.  The mouthfeel is superb.  Wonderful sour cherry flavor.  Tart and lovely.  My only question, and maybe the reason its kind of rated lower for me, is:  Why is this a Flanders Red Ale and not a fruit beer?  New Glarus Belgian Red is to Flanders Red Ale as Kalamazoo Bell's Cherry Stout is to Stout/Sweet Stout.  If this was a fruit beer, or I was convinced otherwise, this beer would be a 4.5+, but as it stands...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

4213,"2002-10-11",4.2,"I figured that Id really like this stuff, since I love Door County cherries, I get some every summer.  This stuff is the color of fresh cherry juice, amply carbonated, with a pinkish, champagne-y head.  Pure, unadulterated cherry essence, both in smell and taste.  Theres a delicate cinnamon flavor behind all that fruit, mixed in with hints of graham cracker.  The quality of the ingredients and the brewing skill here is evident.  This is how all fruit beers should be done.  Id like like a little more of the base malt to poke through, cause the wave of cherry sweetness can get a little overwhelming, especially at the end of the bottle.  This would be great with black forest chocolate cake.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"

4213,"2002-09-30",3.7,"What an interesting and difficult to describe beer. A beautiful ruby colored beer with decent head. The aroma is CHERRIES! Whoa i knew it was a fruit beer but i didnt expect this. The flavor is intensely cherry but just when it starts to become too much a blast of sour cuts in and adds a depth of complexity to the beer. Dont think i could drink this everyday but it would be nice every now and again. I would like to age a bottle for awhile. I think i will....","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"

4213,"2002-09-16",5.0,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2003 Rerate - Reddish brown color, hazy. Small to no head. Aroma is cherry and malt. WOW.. AND I DO MEAN WOW!! I had this beer several years ago, and while I had no notes on it. It tastes exactly the way I remembered it. Medium bodied. Intense cherry flavor, sweet, sour and tart. There is some malt sweetness as well as hop spiciness as well. Complex and intense flavors. Extremely smooth. Not very beer like, closest style might be a lambic?? But, who cares it tastes amazing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is clean and sweet. World class beer.

4213,"2002-09-12",4.2,"It is a brownish kriek with significant head retention.The first thing that hits your nose is a candyish cherry armoma.  Then you taste candy flavour right at the beginning.  A sour sensation takes over and then the sweetness of the cherry comes through with the cleaner cherry flavour along with it.  The beer finally leaves you with earthy cereal and almond flavours and a lingering sourness.  It is very complex and quite unique.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"

4213,"2002-08-27",4.0,"A little bit odd. I was expecting something kriek like, and thats not really whats going on here--not really sour at all--nor is it really like the Flanders red Ive had--to much cherry. That having been said, its a decent beer on its own merits--strong bing cherry flavor dominates, though its not too sweet at all and finishes with a decent bitterness.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
4213,"2002-08-23",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2004 Pours murky brownish red, with a thin but lasting head.  Aroma is incredibly intense authentic cherry with some estery fruitiness showing through.  Flavor is dominated by tart cherries, huge malts are hard to notice unless you plug your nose while sipping (seriously!).  Dominant fruit and lack of classicly stylish qualities cause some to rate this lower (too much cherry!  not enough beer!).  This is carefully, painstakingly, no-expense-spared, finely crafted stuff and I'm lucky to have easy access to it.

The label says over a pound of cherries in every bottle and I think this might be an understatement. Cherries permeate the aroma and flavor of this beer, although its far from one-dimensional. Nutmeg aroma and flavor. Some cinnamon. A little vanilla. Sweet. A little tartness. Very full bodied. This is a beer that I tasted with high expectations and I was not let down.

A little too much carbonation, but thats the only real problem with it. Nice and sweet, very noticeable cherry flavor. Also the smoothest drink Ive ever had. Like drinking silk is the closest I can come to describing the feel in my mouth. And the most heavenly aftertaste Ive ever had.

4213,"2002-06-10",4.2,"This is a unique experiment in North America, so far as I know.  It is reputedly spontaneously fermented--outside Belgium, I know of no others.  This beer takes its flavor from the cherries the brewery uses, which are sweeter and darker than those used in Belgian krieks.  The balance of this beer is between the sweetness of those cherries and the sour yeast note.  It is perhaps more sweet and less sour than I would prefer, but if its spontaneously fermented, the sour note wouldnt be adjustable.  A remarkable accomplishment.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Troobie99"

Great beer, hard to imagine a fruit beer any better. Excellent.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
4213,"2002-03-15",2.8,"A beautiful red that shimmers; Head was thin to non-existent; What would you expect in the nose- Cherries. The tartness is too overwhelming. As much as I try and try to like these types of beers, I just can not f-ing get it. Fruit can be a nice addition to a beer, but perhaps, IMHO, shouldnt be the foundation of a beer. Stouts with flavoring can be good, but what the heck was this before they added all the cherries? Puckered my lips almost in the fashion of a Carillon. The wife loved it though, so she got to finish off the bottle.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"

This beer pours a deep garnet red with lots of hazyness.  Nice pink head lasts for a while.  Aroma is ripe cherries, oak and other woods.  The flavor is mostly cherries and the oak aging can be detected, but is int over bearing.  Very vineous and sour, but definatly desirable.  The palate is sprizy and fizzy but very round and full.

Start is quite sweet, the middle moderate, the finish is acidic, sour, with just a touch of hops, and a lingering sweetness in the after taste. Once upon a time I did not care for this style, but like my old BUD Ebeneezer Scrooge, I have had a reclamation. I now see the errors of my ways, and hopefully the tons of chain and beer kegs, will not fetter me upon my entrance to that great brewery in the sky, Im sure the Master Brewer will forgive my transgressions.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

Flavor is awesomely sour, but with lots of cherry sweetness and a great rich mouthfeel to balance.  Might be a tad too carbonated (though not as much if you let it warm in the glass) but the finish is awesome and so is the overall experience.  Another masterpiece from one of Wisconsin's finest. 9/5/9/4/19

Flemish Sour Tasting with MartinT & Rastacouere Part 1 #9.  Absolutely perfect rendition of cherry pie in a bottle; the nose is of sweet and tart cherries perfectly married in a light, biscuity crust, with small hints of vanilla, cinnamon, butter and ginger...the flavor is mostly sweet, lightly spicy, juicy and wonderfully full-bodied, with lovely caramel and light cocoa underpinnings, vanilla and oak and just a dash of amaretto in the finish.  Not at all too sweet in my book, rather the cherry sweetness is balanced by the intense tapestry of other baked goodies in the flavor, a firm malty body and touches of sourness from start to finish.  Flawless.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4213,"2001-12-12",4.7,"Understandable that this beers won tons of awards.  Starts with a slightly sour cherry taste, finishes with a lingering aftertaste with slight hints of chocolate.

4213,"2001-12-02",4.5,"I will admit, I am not a fan of most fruit beers (except Lambics).  This one changed my mind.  It is fantastic.  Dominated by a cherry pie aroma and backed up by spice and fuit from the beer the aroma is truly fine. Refreshingly tart with a fruity acidity that keeps the subtle sweetness from becoming cloying.  Not just a real cherry character, but the character of the best cherries you have ever sucked of the pit.  Remarkable.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","Northernbrewer"
