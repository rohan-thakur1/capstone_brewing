173,"2017-05-30",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a deep cola brown to black with a thin tan head. Big roast and coffee, dont really get the smoke on the nose. Medium bodied, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, a hint of roast and the faintest bit of smoke, but Im searching for it hard. Slow chocolate, roast, cocoa, malt, roast on the finish. Long lingering roast, very faint smoke, but Im really searching for it. Probably wouldnt pick this up blind. Tasty chocolate filled stout, light coffee but never really got the smoke that I was expecting. Doesnt keep it from being delicious though.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Good fresh roasted coffee in this, with lightly smoked malts, dark chocolate, earth, tobacco. Mild roast. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a dry, roasty mouthfeel. No particular element of this stands out particularly, but it all comes together really nicely. The imperial, barrel-aged version also enhances it remarkably in my estimation, where others at my table found them more even.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Aroma is intense bitter chocolate and plums, maybe even wine grapes, with burnt caramel and mega chocolate-covered espresso bean. Coffee is present but is more roasty Starbucks than light and fruity cold brew, perhaps because of its interplay with roasty malt.

173,"2014-06-12",4.1,"Nitro pour, so you just know it looks good or at least like pretty much any black beer on on nitro. Black body with a creamy tan head, that creamy beige. Tons of lacing. Pretty pour for their first nitro selection. Aroma has huge chocolate, just a big dose of semi sweet chocolate sauce. Theres mild smoke, which kinda gets lost in the chocolate. Some caramel. Solid roast. Pretty big coffee, really good flavor. Taste has plenty of chocolate but more roast and coffee. Theres probably a little more smoke, still fairly mild. Mild cola. The coffee is recognizably from Sightglass - I like coffee - and has a nice roast level with some chocolate, vanilla and berry flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but a bit less so than most nitro pours - no idea if that is about the beer, a conscious decision or just early kinks with the nitro tap. Very solid beer. Better than I remember it from last time. The coffee and chocolate flavors come together very well, and it works perfectly with the smooth nitro pour. Delicious.
