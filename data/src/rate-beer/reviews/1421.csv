1421,"2017-01-26",3.1,"Bottle from Hopfen & Malz. Nutty brown with a full head. Aroma of cloudy malts. Flavour is grainy, malt, dry nutty caramel, lynam by dry bitter malt finish.","Berlin, GERMANY","culchiem"
1421,"2016-12-25",4.2,"The beer has a nice copper color. The beer is rather celar. On top of the beer a nice layer of rough slightly off-white foam is formed. The bulk of the foam collapses quickly. After a while a thin drape of foam is left.
The smell of the beer is nice, though a bit mild. There are delicious sweet malt aromas, containing some bready aromas and even tastiness. There is also a nice bitter hop aroma, also containing some nice fruity tones. I like the smell. 
The taste is even better. There is a delicious malt flavour. Its a bit burned, nice and toasty. I really like that. There are also delicious bitter flavours of the hops, and slight sours. It contains some nice fruity touches. It is im good balance.
The palate of the beer is good. It is a medium bodied, smooth beer with a medium to high carbonation. The finish is nice and contains a nice bitterness. I like this beer.","Capelle aan den IJssel, NETHERLANDS","Gangstergafje"

1421,"2015-12-26",3.4,"0.5 l swingtop bottle from the brewpub, bottled a week ago. Clear, dark reddish amber with a medium large, frothy, slowly diminishing, tan head. Sweetish-malty, slightly fruity aroma of raisins, caramel and brown sugar. Sweetish-malty taste of caramel, burnt nuts and brown sugar, followed by a short, slightly to medium bitter, minimally grassy finish. Medium body, slightly creamy mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Highly quaffable but not too spectacular. Just nice.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"
1421,"2015-12-12",3.6,"Swing top Bottle @ the source. Dark Amber color. Toffee and Maltaroma. Firm floral grassy hopbitter flavor with caramel and plums. Lovely persistent fruity hopbitter finish. Its all about the balance.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
1421,"2014-12-22",3.8,"Pours an almost black, ember coal color, with a huge, froth head.

Smells of toasted malts, peppery clove, banana, honey and toffee.

Has a very smooth moutfeel, which is silk, almost creamy. Tastes of burned, bready malts, which define the character of the beer. Got a decent note of toffee sweetness, which comes along with peppery spices and bakers chocolate, revealing a smoked hint. While it provides possible sweet flavors, the beer is actually dryer than the normal version, as a gentle amount of hops wrap the malts up, supported by a slightly metallic carbonation. Finishes dry, with toasted, earthy, slightly salted honeyed malts.","GERMANY","aleigator"
1421,"2014-12-11",3.6,"50cl fliptop bottled 11/11/2014, freshly catered by McTapps, danke! Metallic herbal hops and liquid caramels in aroma, turn into very prominent DE hop bitterness given just enough body for a confident Alt, although maybe a bit too little for a proper Xmas beer: this is hardly more wintery fare than their usual offering, maybe a bit maltier. Gorgeously subtle spicy hop profile though, with even some seasonal candied orange peel, clove coming in - the extracts must be bittering only. As with all top Alts very sessionable.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

1421,"2013-12-13",2.6,"Ach nein, irgendwie hatte ich doch was anderes erwartet. Zumal Fuechschen als normales ein grandioses Flaschenbier daherkommt. Dieses jedoch erscheint ein wenig dumpf, ein wenig bitter und leicht aromenlos. Sicher, ein paar Nuesse mag man finden und etwas hopfigen Unterton, doch alles in allem ist es #nur# ein sueffiges Bierchen, dass ein wenig streng schmeckt. Ganz ok halt.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
1421,"2013-12-12",3.9,"Pours out of the bottle in a clear amber-golden-hazelnut colour with low head and medium body. Aroma of matured hops and straw. Taste of nuts, hops, straw, torf, caramel, citrus, bread and flowers. Very, very dry and bitter finish - but I enjoyed it a lot. Looking forward to drink it on tap soon, though.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"

There appeared to be quite some interest & love for this one  apparently not to common either, brewed once a year and sold only at the brewpub if I understand things correctly. Pours copper brown. Smell is quite typical german fare, caramel, lager yeast, sweet, bread, sticky dark fruits, Similar taste sweet with some herbs, toffee, lager yeast, bready malts, sticky dark fruits, tad to light, not outspoken enough for my personal preference.

Geschmacklich prägen hauptsächlich hopfen und malzigkeit dieses Saisonbier (auch im Nachgeschmack) dazu kommt ein touch Röstmalz. Das Bier besitzt schön intensive und ausgeprägte Aromen, sehr lecker!! Man schmeckt das es ein Weihnachtsbier ist denn, der Unterschied zu normalen Altbieren ist vorhanden. Fazit1: Noch eins! Beim zweiten Glas bestätigt sich der Eindruck das sich der schon im vorderen teil gute Geschmack des Bieres beim weiter trinken (mitte-, unterer- teil) noch einmal verbessert!
