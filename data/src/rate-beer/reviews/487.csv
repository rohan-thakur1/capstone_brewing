487,"2017-05-21",4.2,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but is a recent release.

Aromas of big nutty medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, cream, brown sugar, toffee, and toasted dark bread; with light notes of smoke, dark fruit, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness.

Slight dryness from herbal/roast bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 7.8%. Overall this is a fantastic imperial coffee stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and coffee flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV.

487,"2016-07-17",4.0,"Thanks Johnmay! (Great dude from WI and untapped buddy)
This was poured into a nonic.
The appearance was a dark brown color close to black with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. No lacing.
The smell took rich dark and milk chocolate to boot at roasty and sweet coffee bean (somewhat espresso-like). Light cake underneath.
The flavor takes the previously mentioned flavors to combine nicely. Lingering chocolate cake-like to cocoa rich aftertaste. Quick sweet wet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation rides nicely along - slight stickiness, but acceptable.

S: Mellow roasted coffee. Smooth and subtle. Not burnt or charred. Some sweet caramel and chocolate in the background.

T: Compared to the nose, there is much more offered here. I really enjoyed the mellowness of the roasted coffee. Some stouts in this style have a potent coffee blast that masks all other flavors. Not so here. A rich, creamy sweetness of other roasted malts impart a delicate chocolate and caramel flavor.

M: Smooth, medium bodied. Moderate carbonation maintains the delivery from start to finish. Nice, delicate finish.

487,"2011-12-11",3.0,"The few Central Waters beers Ive had have been really nice, so while I did enjoy this beer, I just didnt feel like it did anything for me. The beer pours out a dark brown/black body with dark brown edges and a light, light tan 1/4"" head. Aroma starts out with some coffee grounds, walnuts, light vanilla and some wet dirt. It was all really restrained though, as the volume was kept down to 4 instead of blaring at 9 or 10. Flavor had some astringent puckery character that I found a bit off putting, like putting a spoon of coffee and aspirin together. Coffee did show up, but when a brewery calls a beer a ""coffee stout"", in my opinion, it has to showcase coffee in the best way possible. I just didnt think this beer did that, as the coffee was too restrained for my liking. I have 4 more beers to change my opinion though.

Keeping things pretty much the same. Its not getting any better in any way, but the aroma did change somewhat. What comes out is a Tabasco-like aroma...almost bell-pepper like. It wasnt bad, and some would probably be off-put by the aroma. I just found it interesting. The coffee level was still very restrained.

Pours dark brown with a large tan head that leaves nice webs of lacing and holds a creamy cap.

Aroma is a nice blend of premium coffee beans, cocoa, vanilla and caramel.  Some nuts, bread and toast as well.  Smells like a coffee ice cream sundae topped with fudge, caramel and nuts.  Very inviting and very good strength.

Flavor pretty much follows suit.  Coffee ice cream sundae with plenty of delicious toppings.  Premium coffee, milk chocolate/cocoa, caramel, vanilla, some roasted malts, nuts and bread.  Some sweetness, low bitterness.  Minimal alcohol.  As it warms/progresses, the chocolate, caramel, etc step back a bit and becomes more straight up coffee and roasted malts.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, soft and creamy with low to moderate carbonation.

Well the coffee is still holding on strong and this is quite the treat.  Literally a dessert in a glass.  I could only imagine what a fresh sample would be like.

4.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of creamy, tan head with good retention (excellent for a coffee beer) and tons of lacing (impressive for a coffee beer).

5.0 S: This is incredibly nutty. Im shocked at how nutty it is. After that there is a huge helping of milk chocolate and caramel. Only after that does the coffee come in. It mixes with the chocolate to give a cafe mocha vibe. Just a touch of roastiness to balance things out. This has a huge nose which is stronger than most beers twice the ABV.

5.0 T: The taste is much like the nose. Tons of nuts, milk chocolate, and caramel. Coffee complements rather than dominates. The coffee and roasted malts team up to give only a mild roastiness. This is a fairly sweet beer overall. Perhaps a touch of dark fruitiness, but that all falls to the wayside.

5.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Incredibly creamy and super smooth.

5.0 D: Im a pretty harsh rater and Ive searched and searched for a reason to not give this beer the scores that I have. Obviously, I could not find any reasons. This is easily the best single stout Ive had. Incredible amount of flavor and each component contributes positively to the whole. Time for an ISO.

It pours a deep dark brown with a foamy light tan head. It doesnt look as good as th Peruvian Morning.

The aroma is top-notch though, absolutely. It smells like a coffee house in the area surrounding the bottle, it is super-fragrant. If you sniff from the bottle you get a thick hit of caramel. From the glass it is kind of because there is a hint of metallic scent. For this i have to dock it a little. Sniff th bottle, you will enjoy it more than our of the glass, which I find interesting.

The flavor is also coffee to the full, but again Im getting the metallic character. It is a bit too coffee-oriented for me, it pretty much tastes like metallic coffee. I prefer their Peruvian Morning so much more.

Aroma is predominantly coffee, more of a lighter roast being showcased than the usual dark roast prevalent in other coffee stouts.  There is also something off about the aroma, and I believe it stems from the high alcohol clashing with the coffee.  Little bit of maple syrup and some peanut butter as well.  Vanilla shows up in a big way with further warming.  The smell is growing on me, and it would be great if the alcohol was toned down.  The flavor is equally as good, with plenty of even roasted coffee, peanut butter, and roasted malt.  Lightly salty and a little chalky in the finish.

Pours dark brown, I can actually see through it when holding it up.  Appearance is almost cola like, lots of carbonation with a small bubbly beige head.  A hard pour on my second bottle created a much larger and more appealing head.  Nose is coffee, chocolate, vanilla and sweet milk.  Taste is complex, very heavy on the chocolate with a roasted coffee middle but almost no harshness or bitterness in the finish.  As it warms the roasted coffee becomes more dominate.  Taste more molasses and vanilla and the finish becomes slightly bitter.  Very enjoyable beer but in my opinion is more like a brown ale than a stout.  I really want to crack open a November right now and compare.  Very similar but this has more of a roasted coffee flavor.  Doesnt taste like 8.2%, but it is starting to feel like it is.  More drinkable than you would expect and more than some similar 6% offerings.  I still think this is a american brown ale and am going to rate it as such.

487,"2010-11-27",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 Was lucky enough to pick up a bottle of this at Steves in Madison, WI in August 2009.

Pours a dark brown with an espresso head. The nose is overwhelming coffee and dark malts, and this is exactly how the taste follows it up. The true highlight of this beer is the mouthfeel--its so utterly thick and creamy that its unlike most other coffee stouts. This has the mouthfeel of a Russian Imperial, and I really wish that I could give this a 5.5 for MF and that other brewers would follow. Drinkability is way up there as well, as the creamy mouthfeel makes you want sip after sip.

487,"2010-05-19",4.3,"Thanks Brian23456 for hooking me up with this! 12 oz bottle.

A- Body is a dark, murky, nearly opaque maple brown hue. Body consistency is surprisingly dynamic. Pours with a frothy 2 finger creme brulee colored head that slowly fades to 1/2 finger and leaves a ton of lacing behind in the glass.

S- Nose is good- and very rich, dark chocolate, toffee, a lot of caramel, and of course some roasted malt in the background.

T-Flavor is also good and rich-not as sweet and thick as the nose gives the impression of though. Upfront is some toffee, roasted malt, a hint of earthy hop, and a hint of chocolate and caramel. The highlight of the finish is roasted malt but there are nice accents of sweet caramel, chocolate, toffee, and molasses to balance it as well as a faint impression of herbal hops. What lingers on the palate is a moderate roasted malt bitterness as well as impressions of the rest of the palate.

P-High tingly carbonation and a relatively thick, smooth, body.

O- This is a good, drinkable, American Coffee stout. Great balance of sweet and black coffee notes. This brew is certainly a coffee stout-but is more well put together and less extreme than a lot of examples that I have had of this sub-style. It is deserving to be ranked among the best for the style. Also a pretty big flavor for a non-imperial ABV.

Pours a dark chestnut-brown with strange fizzy bubbly head -- kind of looks like cola thats starting to go flat. Aroma is coffee accented by a pungent, peppery spice. Flavor is much the same -- coffee with chocolate notes and a spicy, peppery kick, but the pepper is dialed down compared to the aroma (thankfully). Palate is thinnish and oily.

487,"2009-03-13",3.7,"2/11/2009:  Central Waters Brewhouse Coffee Stout has the appearance like slightly watered-down coffee:  brown with an amber hue.  Like coffee, there really isnt any head at all (more head develops as the beer warms up).  The aroma is also coffee; actually more like canned coffee grounds with a hint of mocha and a good wad of tobacco.  Coffee dominates the flavor, but it isnt totally coffee.  It is more like coffee with a touch of cream and sugar as well as roasty chocolate and caramelized malt.  There is still quite a bit of beer in the flavor so I would still call it a coffee-infused beer rather than coffee with a shot of beer.  That is a good thing.  It has a bit of body and mouthfeel which is nice too.  Overall I am enjoying this coffee beer.  I think they did a pretty good job with it that I could drink a few of and not be tired of it or overwhelmed by the coffee.  Nice job on this one Central Waters!

Brewhouse Coffee Stout leaves the bottle chestnut brown but as it collects in the glass becomes the darkest of browns bordering on black. A finger and a half worth of beige head formed on the pour and although it fell to a thick cap had really good staying power. Leaves intricate sticky drink lines down the glass. This is a very good looking stout.

This is a coffee bomb but I can really appreciate dark chocolate and cocoa in the background. Freshly brewed coffee hits hard right away and lasts throughout the smell. The chocolate adds a great depth and makes for a delicious smelling beer. After giving the glass a slight swirl there’s even some vanilla present. 

There is an incredible depth of flavor in this beer. The coffee is more of component of the whole instead of stomping over all other flavors like some other coffee infused brews tend to do. It’s loaded with the freshest brewed highest quality coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, and hazelnut all in that order of intensity. The finish is like rich fudge. This is so close to getting a perfect score.

The mouthfeel was decent upfront but as this beer continues to warm the overall feel becomes much better. Medium bodied, slightly creamy, and slow moving.

The lower abv, moderate mouthfeel, and deliciousness make this a pure joy to put away. The glass and bottle are disappearing much quicker then I’d like but I can’t help myself gulping it down.

This is another excellent beer from Central Waters. Another one of Wisconsin’s great breweries. Every time I head up North I’m sure to pick up as many Central Waters products as monetarily possible.

Picked up the weekend of the Great Taste I tried this about two weeks ago.  For the price it is quite a deal; while more expensive than if it were a six pack it is just the right size for an evening’s enjoyment.  I hope that this enters their regular lineup so that more people can have a chance to try it.

Aroma / Appearance - The ash white head grew to two fingers before beginning to settle.  Underneath was a black body that swirled fluidly around the pint glass.  Dark roasted coffee, chocolate and a hint of vanilla melded nicely in the headspace.  As you’d expect from a solid coffee stout it does not hide its origins.

Flavor / Palate - Straight black coffee and rich chocolate sat on the tongue for a while before beginning to fade.  As it did a stable bitterness lingered in the back of the throat.  A more economical version of Breakfast Stout this is worth trying if you are driving through the Madison area.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Well, as a coffee beer lover, the aroma is nothing short of stunning. Its freshly ground coffee...and in the best possible way. There are also some hints of roasted malts and dark fruits. Ive had a ton of coffee stouts and this is without equal in terms of aroma.
The taste is dominated by a slightly bitter coffee taste, but there is definitely a more prevalent sweet malt background than in the aroma.  Dark fruits are also present, but the coffee comes back to leave a bitterness in the finish.

Mouthfeel is silky smooth and medium bodied with strong carbonation for the style.

Aroma has tons of cold coffee up front followed by some roasted malts and dark chocolate.  Not terribly complex, but very nice.  Flavor is more stout-like with roasted malts and dark chocolate--still theres the cold coffee in the background, but quite a bit less.  Some caramel malt is noted with just a hint of alcohol, but I couldnt place this over 6.5% or so at the most.  Finishes dry with bitterness peaking around a 2-3.  Medium body with light carbonation.  Went just a hair downhill after the aroma, though still a pretty solid coffee stout.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

487,"2008-06-01",4.1,"Bottle at Noogfest 08, thanks to Iowaherkeye I believe. Pours dark black with brown head. The aroma smells just like a pot of coffee. Medium to full bodied with a smooth, non sticky texture. The flavor has lots of coffee flavor (as it should), but has a nice amount of sweetness and dark chocolate to accent. A perfect amount of balancing bitterness. Finishes semi dry. Excellent coffee stout.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

487,"2008-04-23",3.6,"Thanks to Flyer for splitting this with SurlySober and me.

This beer struck me in appearance as more of a brown ale, but maybe ""coffee brown ale"" doesnt roll off the tongue as well as ""coffee stout.""  It was brown and translucent, with abundant off-white head.  Unlike most beers with coffee-notes, this beer really tastes like coffee!  A lot of beers with coffee flavor taste like an approximation of coffee, and are sweet, so they come off tasting to me like coffee-flavored ice cream rather than actual coffee.  This one tastes like coffee...period.  Smell is lots of coffee, and not much else, maybe some caramel malt.  Mouthfeel was unremarkable, but good.

I would recommend this beer.  I thought it quite nice.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

487,"2008-03-06",4.2,"Rich ,roasted coffee bean aroma,I was really surprised on how good the quality of this aroma was,its all coffee,some roasted barley, like sticking my nose in a fresh bag of Columbian coffee beans. Taste is another coffee blast on the palate, seems like it will be smooth and creamy,but takes a turn in mid swallow and becomes somewhat coffee bean bitter and very dry in the swallow,bitterness gets a little harsh,and some swallows are a little thin,but a wonderful coffee flavor is sustained to the end of each sip. An excellent coffee brew.","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"

Somewhat thin in feel. Certainly is a coffee brew. Black coffee flavors take charge. Middle has a touch of toasted malt, but coffee is still the main player. Touch of alcohol noted in the finish along with, surprise, surprise some sweetened coffee. If you like sweet black coffee this one is for you.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Very dark in color but not black with a small tan head.  Aroma of fresh roasted coffee.  It reminded me of my kitchen in the morning.  There was mainly coffee in the flavor as well although there is a slight chocolate and maybe some cream.  Very nice.","Coralville, Iowa, USA","KAF"

487,"2008-01-28",3.8,"On draught at the brewery Taproom in Amherst, Wisconsin. Sampled during the Central Waters 10th Anniversary Party. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a creamy beige head that quickly dissipates to a film top and beige ring. Aroma of mostly distinct roasted coffee grounds that overpowers all other character aroma. I could just barely pick up any roasted dark malt or molasses, maybe a hint of flowery hops, but not much. Taste is when most other flavors/scents come through. Thought it has a mostly coffee flavor, the chocolate and flowery hop flavor is quite pleasant.  Finish has a coffe aftertaste at first and then changes to milk chocolate and then a dry toasted dark malt flavor. Quite a personality switcher during the finish which makes this a memorable beer.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
487,"2007-04-02",3.9,"Growler, courtesy of Schutzenliesel.  Thanks, Tom!  This is a brewpub-exclusive brew that just came out (the growler clearly indicated that it was a coffee stout and not the farmhouse coffee porter).  Pours a dark brown center; medium tan head with great retention and lacing.  Pleasant, roasted coffee aroma; light milk chocolate.  Full mouthfeel: coffee upfront, but with plenty of layered bitter chocolate and potent alcohol backing things up; bitter citrus character.  Lengthy, bitter chocolate and citrus finish.  A very tasty beer, but I think its a bit rough around the edges.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
