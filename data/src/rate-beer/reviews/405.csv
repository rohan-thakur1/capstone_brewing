405,"2015-09-30",3.6,"At Borefts. You do not see many examples of this post-Prohibition style of North American thirst quencher in Europe so I was curious about this, though it is, of course, a present-day craft beer elaboration. Snow white, creamy head, hazy deep peachy golden colour with somewhat greenish hue. Aroma of dried orange peel, toasted bread, peach, pineapple, mango, fried onion (the hops I suppose - as in Summit, but apparently Australian varieties have been used here). Crisp, cleanly fruity onset with citrus peel freshness, strong carbo but still smooth and supple mouthfeel, light caramelly malt base, ending in a surprisingly hoppy finish, peppery, citrusy, even a bit piney, long and drying. Clearly the traditional cream ale has been used here as a vehicle to showcase the Australian hops that have been used, but I guess this only accentuates a style otherwise largely under-exposed by modern craft beer culture.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
