326,"2015-07-27",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2015 Thanks to tderoeck, enjoyed at his place with tderoeck, sebletitje, 77ships and omgrich. Extra hoppy version of the regular Congress Street which we tasted next to it. Looks exactly the same: stable, frothy, hops-enhanced, snow white, creamy head, cloudy peach yellow blonde colour. Very aromatic, spruce, lemon zest, flowers, lime, hemp, peach, pineapple, soap, very close to the regular one but more aromatic still and a bit more lush and exotic. Same for the flavour: it has the same clean but lively fruitiness in onset, perhaps a bit more pineapple flavour but difficult to say, same degree of carbonation (fizzy but not too much), same light bready malt profile, but a more complex, more outspoken and more bittering hoppiness, with a bit more earthiness and yeastiness in the finish. This one has a tad more grapefruit hoppiness and more fragrance, but I cannot say this automatically makes it better than the regular Congress Street: to me, both are on a par as being very elegant, refined, fragrant IPAs of world class quality. Hugely enjoyed both - apparently the Trillium hype is well-deserved.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

326,"2015-07-12",4.1,"Bottled 6/9/15. Bottle to snifter. Pours a quite murky light orange deep yellow color, looks like juice. Off white head. All I can say about the aroma is WOW! Huge citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, tropical fruit character. Flavor is just a tad sharp, hence the drop in points, but still wonderful. Some of that sharpness lingers into the finish. Irregardless, this is a wonderful beer! Thanks JP for sending me this one!","Norfolk, Virginia, USA","Dr_Fellini"
326,"2015-07-01",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2017 32oz growler filled 6/11/15, drunk 6/30/15Well, I let er sit in the bottom of the fridge for 2.5 weeks, always hoping the sediment will drop. I think Im just going to give up on doing that and accept that Trilliums beers pour like a milkshake. This one looks like a lemon curd shake, yet the large white head is very well-retained. Go figure.At first whiff, its quite fragrant. Inescapable lemons, light grapefruit pith, orange blossom are all fresh and brighten the nose nicely. As it breathes a bit, and over the course of the first glass or so, I definitely get a distinct note of green onions. Its not awful (surprisingly) and theres no garlic to go with it, thankfully. The nose is very dry, yet you can sense a soft backing of lightly doughy, lightly honeyed malts in the background that never allow the nose to get too astringent/resinous. No alcohol or flaws.The flavor is quite a rollercoaster. Over the half hour or so it took me to drink this, I got the very strong, dry lemon-grapefruit character, which then seemed to transition in to the scallion-like flavor, which in turn gave way to a very distinct watermelon/tangerine flavor. Either my palate adjusted to the scallion, or it disappeared. Whatever the case, the last glass was pure watermelon and citrus bliss. I kept waiting for the beer to get sweeter as it warmed, but it remained wonderfully well-attenuated and yet soft and supple.So here I am, scoring a scallion-flavored IPA a 4+. Also, the amount of citrus character in these things is unbelievable. The watermelon/nectarine/strawberry character really helped break that up, but its still close to a citrus bomb. Yet theres never a bit of syrupiness, astringency or resin, and to be honest, I never care too much what flavors my beers have, as long as the elements (bitter/alcohol/malt/sour/roast) are balanced (not counting some lambics) and the texture is highly drinkable.Mid April 2017 batchWhew...this was pretty unbelievable.  Spicy as all hell with tons of enjoyable, varied juice notes and yet a bit more bitterness than usual, as well.  Soft, dry but creamy almost.  Very sublime and with no resin/alcohol or flaw.  One of the better batches Ive ever had.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The flavor is just as bright and juicy. Mango, papaya with a great danky, onion/ scallion flavors. The garlic /onion/ scallion note reminds me of a few other Artisanal New England brews. The hops are only lightly bitter and is supported by a nice level of grain and pale malts. Love this brew as well as many others from this fine brewer.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
