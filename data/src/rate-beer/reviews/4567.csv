4567,"2016-12-24",4.1,"330ml bottle bought at HK Brewcraft in Central.
Looks: Cloudy hazy amber red colour with a thin ring of yeast sediments; One and a half finger head with crumpety off-white foam which last for 4 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet Ale malt, with strong lychee, jackfruits, canned peaches, honey, floral, sugar, resins, light pine, coriander and grass. Very pleasant!

Taste: Mid to strong sweet Ale malt, with strong orange peel, strong grapefruits, caramel, wheaty tartness, floral, strong molasses, pine, strong resins, spices, earth, biscuits, strong lemon, very strong bitter hops and grass. Wow!

Body: Mid to full body. Very slick and oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Very rich Ale maltyness in a thick background, despite the presence of notable wheat and tartness. Strong West Coast hops dominates with fresh grapefruits, strong resin ooze, earth and pine, which enhances the already strong orange peels. Flowery and sweet with strong lemon to round. Excellent!

Hoppiness: Lychee, jackfruits, peaches, honey, floral, resins, and grass in nose. Strong grapefruits, floral, pine, strong resins, earth, strong lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is very strong for a lasting, high astringent sweet-bitter malty finish.

After Taste: Quite Dry. Spicy malty and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is essentially a strong Red IPA to the extent that wheatyness could not wear down its rich and sweet maltyness. The tropical fruity oozy hoppiness coupled with loads of orange peels, good looks and finishing, its really something special for the season. Great stuff and Merry Xmas!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

A Mikkeller főzete nem a megszokott, túlfűszerezett téli vonalat képviseli, a réz színű ital egy tartalmas india pale ale jellemvonásait ölti annak trópusi gyümölcsös, fenyős, karamellás karakterét előtérbe helyezve, melyhez egy narancshéjas, üde és aromás hangulat társul, némi belga tripeles korinaderes levezetéssel. Fűszeresség hiányában tehát semmi esetre sincs a sör, a búzasörökre jellemző élénk, pikánsan csípőskés jelleg is könnyedén felfedezhető benne.

Amber, hazy body, with a big, frothy to creamy, light beige head.
Aroma of wheat, berries, tropical fruits, orange, some banana, caramel.
Taste is about the same, also spices and more orange peel.
Mouthfeel is medium, slick, with a medium carbonation and it finishes spicy, wheaty, medium bitter, fruity and a bit astringent.

Tasty! One of the best Wit beers Ive ever had, although it is pretty unique for this style and also has a bit with an IPA or Amber Ale in common. Great balance, lovely, manifold wheat and fruit notes and easy to drink despite the high ABV.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

4567,"2014-08-12",3.1,"This was poured into a mug and shared with my buddy Darin.
The appearance was a semi - hazy burnt orange to slight ruddy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was somewhat there but slid for the most part. 
The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus to mandarin orange with a decent caramel base in the background. Lightly spiced through some coriander. 
The taste was mainly sweet but allowed a decent spice in the background. 
On the palate, there was a decent amount of spice to allow some carbonation to hit the tongue just right. It sat about a medium on the body and I found myself sipping this for the most part.

The aroma was of a biscuit malt, pine hops and a sweaty yeast with notes of caramel, citrus (grapefruit and orange peel), corriander and a touch of clove.

The taste was a bitter malty with a mild caramel sweetness and a hint of citrus from the beginning, the finish on the other hand became rather hoppy with a slight citrus peel bitterness and a bit of spice towards the end. The flavor lasted a good long duration following the swallow, with a bitter hoppy and a spicy sweet taste left behind to linger on the taste buds.

Mouthfeel was a step or two past light in body with a mildly dry texture and a medium carbonation.

I get spruce needles (maybe?), lemon, coriander. Pours cloudy orange with a giant long-lasting off-white pillowy head. Creamy lace sheets the glass. Taste starts out sweet and spicy and finishes wit a bitter hop bite. Definitely more red ale or IPAish than witbier. Crisp, interesting, tasty. Carbonation is average and the mouthfeel is creamy. I was really impressed with this at first, but it started to get a little old. That was a really big bottle.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

TECHNICAL: Magnum bottle. Poured a cloudy, light to medium amber with a large, creamy, off-white head that mostly, but slowly, diminished and that left excellent lacing. The aroma had moderate caramel and wheat; moderate to heavy pine, grapefruit and orange hops; light to moderate doughy, spicy and dusty yeast; orange; and coriander. The initial flavor was light to mod sweet, mod to heavily acidic and moderately bitter; while the finish was moderately sweet, mod to heavily acidic and heavily bitter with a long duration. There was caramel malt, wheat, lots of citrus, orange, coriander, pepper, grapefruit; some other fruitiness, spicy yeast and hops, and some metallic hops.

7 Exceptionally toffee-ey taste, lots of fleshy fruits too.
4 Full, sweet, sticky body. Again, not aided by being at the end of the bottle, but if Mikkeller think its a good idea to put beer in bottles this size, theyve got to expect people to judge it after its been tipped up 20 times.

I could not really name individual spices but all I can tell is that they were not the usual array of Christmas beer spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, etc.) and it was a just a nice spicy flavor that not only was original but also worked really well with the piney resinous hops.  I really enjoyed that beer.  Very nice Christmas beer.  But I think that Christmas and other holidays should learn from Halloween and encourage women to dress like sluts.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4567,"2011-05-11",3.8,"Im Antrunk ist das Bier aromatisch hopfig, natürlich, vielfältig. Der Hopfen weitet sich aber sogar noch aus, dabei nimmt er an Herbe zu und ist so nicht mehr der alleinige Taktgeber. Weniger bitter, auch die Herbe ist im Vergleich zum Hopfen dann doch eher gering. Etwas fruchtig und grasig, zudem sind Honignoten erkennbar. Vollmundig hopfig, im Abgang verfliegt er aber merkwürdig schnell und hinterlässt keine bitteren oder herben Noten, das Bier ist minimal grasig. Ein durch und durch auf den Hopfen ausgelegtes Bier! 12/12/11/12//12","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"

Overall : Wow this was very nice. Unique fruity profile mixed with the herbal and floral hops. It was very fresh and very drinkable. Great balance. Didnt really felt the 8% abv. Real nice beer.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
4567,"2011-04-03",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Herbs and conifers spice up this festive brews aroma, as rose water, orange zest and cherries slowly step aside for rising resinous hop bitterness. There is a lot going on here, but it is amazingly harmonious and well rendered. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-Generous foam stays atop the cloudy pale amber.
-Light alcohol burn reminds you that this is not meant to be drunk quickly. The attractive spice and hop combo make you forget about this alcohol though...
-The fluffy, pillowy mouthfeel serves the flavor profile admirably.
-The yeast and base malts add cake flour allusions which are quite pleasant.

4567,"2010-09-30",3.7,"1.5L magnum bottle, courtesy dickinsonbeer, consumed relatively fresh in March 2010.  The pour yields a lightly hazy, dark golden-orange body.  A small, bubbly head of beige froth crowns the surface.  Scattered, tiny lacing spots dot the glass.  The nose is very hoppy, showing strong notes of pine resin, grapefruit, and a hint of green grass, all over a creamy malt base of blonde candy, toffee, and light dessert bread.  There are definitely some lactic, wheaty tendencies.  It comes across much like an imperial wheat IIPA.  Flavors are largely the same, with a few variations.  Again very hoppy and resinous, pine pushes forward as the dominant hop characteristic, joined by supporting notes of oily lemon peel and some peppery wildflowers.  Toffee malt is amply sweet, smoothed out by creamed wheat grain, and sporting a bit of mild spicing.  Thankfully, the bready yeast manages to keep things dry enough to avoid any overly cloying, sugar laden tendencies.  Medium-plus in terms of body stature, the palate sports moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy consistency.  Very nice brew overall.

Medium body, fruity but in the driest sense and then again lovely grapefruit accents, pine and peach from the American aroma hops.

4567,"2009-12-12",4.1,"Hazy, dark golden with a fluffy, medium head. Very fresh, aromatic-hoppy nose with exotic fruit. Almost reminds me of the great Shorts Imperial Spruce India Pilsner. Flavor is very bitter and pine-resiny, but doesnt have any harshness or cat-pee, typical to some Mikkeller brews. Its also very clean, although Id like some more body to balance the hops. Medium-bodied palate, slightly foamy but balanced carbonation. A very pleasant, crisply hoppy Xmas brew.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

You never really now what will hit you with a Mikkeller brew in the glass, so lets see what kind of X-mas brew this is.
Golden with nice almost white head. Pretty light coloured for an X-mas brew.
Lovely hoppy flowery aroma. 
Grape fruit, actually very fruity with oranges. Very long creamy aftertaste.
Very good IPA on the sweet side.
If there is anything X-mas like in this one, it is the nice haystack-like hoppy note together with the orange taste.
Nice beer.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"
