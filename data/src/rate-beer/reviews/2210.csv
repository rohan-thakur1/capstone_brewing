2210,"2015-09-20",3.6,"Draft. No discernable aroma. Cloudy copper color. Flavors of caramel, then butterscotch. Malts come in as chewy pumpernickel in a way that fills the back of the mouth for a while. Smashing marzen.","","TylerGreenDC"

2210,"2015-09-12",3.5,"On tap at standard brewing company. This was a good and distinct Oktoberfest because it has a unique nutty character and is not overly sweet. The aroma should have been stronger, but the finish is extraordinary. You should try this.

2210,"2014-11-16",3.0,"Pour is a clear brown with a small tan head. Aroma is an ok caramel sweetness. Flavor is the same a decent caramel sweetness with a little chewy malt. Kinda missing that dark bread richness that I like in a marzen. Its ok and I would get this again if In early September or early October next year to re-rate.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"

Taste is sweet caramel malt, buttered biscuits, walnuts and a little maple syrup. Very mild hop character, as it should be for the style. Excellent.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
2210,"2014-10-15",3.9,"Tasted on tap at their brewpub, then took a growler home. It poured a pretty clear orange amber with white head and lace. Malty but not cloyingly sweet, excellent noble hop balance, hint of nuts and toast, mineral water. Light-medium body and carbonation, lingering sweet-cereal grain aftertaste. Excellent.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
2210,"2014-10-04",3.9,"Pours copper / amber with a small off-white head. The aroma has dough smooth clean Oktoberfest malt, some nuttiness and a richness that isnt cloying or overly sweet. It has a medium smooth body with some crispness and soft carbonation. The flavor starts with dough, nuttiness, toasty malt, light hops that are spicy and everything about this is clean and smooth. the finish highlights the clean nuttiness and some spicy hops. Very nice - could be my favorite of the style made in the states.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
