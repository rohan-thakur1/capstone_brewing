4351,"2017-01-18",3.8,"Robust malts and fruity aroma. Nearly black in color with a small brown head. Strong sweet beginning that fades slightly in the finish and develops a slight alcohol bitterness. Very creamy palate.","Waterbury, Connecticut, USA","rocbyter"
4351,"2016-12-26",3.8,"ÛOpaque black liquid topped by a small tan head. Roasted malt aroma reminiscent of dried dark fruit and chocolate. Rich dark malt flavor upfront, with notes of prunes and dried figs. Hints of licorice and molasses as well. Sticky mouthfeel. Rich and smooth, with big sweet roasted malt notes. At 13% ABV, you would expect that there would be a noticeable alcohol prescence. But that is not the case here. Cloyingly sweet, to a fault. Still, this is an interesting brew to be sipped slowly and enjoyed.","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"
4351,"2016-11-28",3.9,"Bottle at home. Deep dark pour smallish head. Nose is dark fruits amd toffee. Tastes of figs, plums, coffee, toffee,earth, some chocolate, and dark liquor. Some alcohol heat on finish. But overall smooth amd drinkable. A brew for explorers and adventureres is something I can get behind.","New York, USA","Jow"
4351,"2016-07-30",3.6,"Pours up a dark brown, with a tan head. Aroma is booze with a hint of pit fruit and phenol aromas. Sweet with dark hot dates, fig and malty caramel front to back. You taste and feel the alcohol burn with this one.","North Carolina, USA","HourGlass13"
4351,"2016-06-14",4.4,"From the 650 ml. bottle dated March 2016. Dark brown to near black pour with a small and short-lived tan head. The aroma is an array of characters including sweet toffee malts, dark fruit, Bourbon barrels, black licorice, and just a hint of chocolate. Low hop profile. Bold body. There is an alcohol burn in the flavor but it is 13% so I am not surprised. Otherwise the booze is reasonably masked but not invisible. Big roasted caramel malt sweetness, dark fruit acidity, and a no to low earthy hop profile. Take this in small amounts.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
4351,"2016-06-07",3.4,"Dark, brown color. Thin , beige head . Aroma of raisins , brown sugar malt . Sweet malty taste with notes of dark fruits and candies . The bottle was too big for me . It should be shared, because closer to the end sweetness seemed very annoying.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sinfull"
