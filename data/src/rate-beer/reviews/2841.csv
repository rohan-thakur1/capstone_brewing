2841,"2015-06-14",3.6,"500ml can from the launch - so technically this is the production version, not the Outpost series. Golden with a big fluffy head and a leafy and herby hop nose. Malty and properly hoppy, with a restrained yet firm and dry bitterness. Very quaffable, and I donÂ’t say that often about a Pils!","Brentford, Greater London, ENGLAND","BeerViking"

Light sweet flavor with some dough pale bread, faint grapefruit, mellow grassy bitterness. Light bodied with average carbonation.
