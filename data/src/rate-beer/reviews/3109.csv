3109,"2017-01-27",4.0,"@SBWF2012. Pitch black colour with a small beigeish brown creamy head which lasts for a while and leaves nice lace. Aroma is smoked and roasted malts along with some chocolate, mild alcohol as well as some toffeeish notes. Flavour is very similar, but in a quite sweet way.

Base beer seems thin and lemon heavy at first but eventually goes to melted dark chocolate bar. Palate is denser through the finish. Not bad. Not the best smoked character.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3109,"2013-04-03",3.8,"Pours a thin nearly opaque black with virtually no head. The aroma is not quite as smoky as I would have figured given the name. There's also some caramel and chocolate in the nose too. On this palate the smokiness is really well balanced and very subtle. It's sweet to start but countered by the smokiness. Really interesting.

Smoke and bourbon are more perceptible in the mouth, with the last being a bit intrusive. Boozy and tough to finish as well, due to its almost syrupy mouthfeel.
