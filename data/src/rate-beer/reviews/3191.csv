3191,"2014-09-18",2.7,"On keg at the Craft #100 at CBC Clapham. Very pale ambar, with a thin white bubbly head. On the nose theres a bit of malt vinegar, cut grass, straw and cereal grain, with some crisp clean lager yeast. Taste is cereal grain, straw and slight cut grass, crispy corn. Its all right but the vinegar on the nose is a bit odd. Not sure why as this is fresh on.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

3191,"2014-01-07",2.7,"On tap at the Red Squirrel. 
Appearance -golden with a nice head. 
Nose - pale malt maybe citrus but its hidden. 
Taste - sweet cornflakes. Frosties I guess.
Palate - a cloying finish. Lagers are generally frowned upon. However the obe thing they reliably dobis cleanse the palate. This doesnt achieve this.
Overall - not great for one of Englands most renowned craft brewers","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"

Cloudy amber with a thick white head; grainy aroma with a trace of orange; soft, smooth and creamy in the mouth, with some orange citrus, and a full grainy body; the finish is dry and very moreish with a marmalade aftertaste.

3191,"2012-04-20",3.8,"On tap at the brewery, Henley-on-Thames, Oxon 20.04.12    Pours mid gold with a white head. Nose is quite gentle, not clinical or hard with no corn or metallic edge that I could discern. these aromas I often get with many lagers, the longer lagering/ageing process has left this softer and a bit more refined. Initially there is a flush of sweet soft malts but this then opens open to reveal a harder more lager like minerally bitterness. I was driving and had already ordered a dirty 69 so could only have a small sample, however it was very good. A8 A4 T8 P4 Ov15 3.8","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
