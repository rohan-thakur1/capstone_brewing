Medium/heavy aroma of malts, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, mocha and roasted malts.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque ruby/dark brown beer with a slight beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, vanilla, chocolate and mocha; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Have to say that these pine needles are nowhere to be found, but it does not matter. Great amount of roasted malts, almost feeling like a porter/stout. That added vanilla gives it a great sweet start, creating some mocha as well. Perfect appearance and a great palate.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

2024,"2017-04-05",3.6,"Brune rouge assez sombre avec de beaux reflets pourpres et une mousse beige réduite à sa plus simple expression. Nez vineux sur de beaux arômes de malts caramel et chocolat, avec de belles notes de noisette, de praliné, de nougat, de cassonade et de sirop dérable. Les arômes de vanille sont bel et bien présents et sharmonisent bien avec les arômes sucrés et boisés. On décèle assez peu les notes houblonnées qui ne sont pas non plus le fond de commerce dune Brown Ale... En bouche, premier contact sur la vanille très net, ensuite sexpriment les saveurs de malts assez peu sucrées (boisées et amères) suivies par lamertume et les levures. Javoue rechercher longuement les notes de résineux que les pignons de pin doivent immanquablement laisser. On les devine mais elles sont masquées par les saveurs de malts et la vanille. Dommage, car ce côté résineux (exploité par la Sapin de chez Mandrin par exemple) peut savérer très intéressant à léquilibre avec les autres arômes et saveurs. La longueur en bouche est assez courte et un peu trop fine. Restent les saveurs de malts caramel (et chocolat !), omniprésentes tout au long de la dégustation. La texture est un peu sur leau quoique souple et douce, la carbonatation est moyenne tandis que lalcool est assez peu virulent malgré un 8% qui aurait du un peu plus ajouter de corps. Il manque sans doute quelques alcools supérieurs et esters pour mettre un coup de fouet sur tout ça. Un breuvage sympathique, très buvable mais trop anecdotique pour marquer les esprits.

Lots of vanilla, pine, husky, some caramel and kama chocolate in taste. Vanilla and sweetish chocolate in aftertaste. Soft carbonation. Maybe tad too much of vanilla for me, but if thats brewers intention Im fine with that. For 8% its a fuckin quaffer! More!","Reval, ESTONIA","Marduk"

Nice coffee sweetness in the aroma, some vanilla sweetness too. Sweetish. Nice malty body. Too sweet maybe? However the 8% is covered very well by that sweetness. Finish has some nice piney needles, an a nice throbby bitterness.
Rerate: Tap (Speakeasy, Tallinn) (6:4:6:3:13=3.2)
Sweet, thick, heavy, tasted like they just adde cocoa powder to a beer. Poor in comparison.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
