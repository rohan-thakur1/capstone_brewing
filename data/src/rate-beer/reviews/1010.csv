1010,"2017-05-29",3.1,"Appearance: Pours an inky, black body with a sustained, light sandy-beige head.

Smell: Char-hinting heavy roastiness with a crust of bitter dark chocolate, with lesser touches of dark fruit, vanilla-infused molasses, woodsiness and peppery alcohol.

Taste: Bulky roastiness, a bit ashen and chary and laden with booziness and soy. Rolls sweet to bitter (charred) with a salient, less-than-satisfying alcohol presence coupled with woody tannins. A bit of dark chocolate, licorice, gummy molasses and prune. The nose held a bit more promise, though the heavy char, soy and booze leave it lopsided and unbalanced.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Light carbonation.

Overall: Downright overhyped.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Aroma of espresso, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, some roast. Flavor follows, full coffee stout in effect, bourbon complementing things very well, coming in firm but gentle after an espresso roast cleans up an initial sweet chocolate. The progression is absurdly impressive, super well-designed, a work of science of the senses. Mouthfeel is tauntingly sticky initially but it becomes silky and fades so nicely.

1010,"2017-01-03",5.0,"6-ty RIS na świecie wypity w ostatni dzień 2016 roku. Nowy Rok przywitałem w wielkim stylu.

Legenda powraca z podwójną siłą beczki po bourbonie.

Piwo na które polowałem od lat. Wiele mnie kosztowało zachodu, aby je nareszcie zdobyć. 
A ile przy tym musiał przejść mój człowiek w USA, to tylko on sam wie. Udało mu się je zdobyć w jednym, jedynym miejscu w Nowym Jorku.

Jeszcze raz dziękuje Wojtek Zawadzki za Twoje zaangażowanie. 
 Alkohol:  10,8% obj. 
 Data rozlewu:  07.01.16 
 Kolor:  Czarny jak smoła, kompletnie nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Gęsta, beżowa, wysoka, sztywna jak dobrze ubita śmietana.
Tworzy jedną warstwę puchu. Doskonale krążkuje na szkle.
Opada do chmurki.
Po zakręceniu pokalem idzie do góry pozostawiając na ściankach setki kropeczek. 
 Zapach:  Przyłożyłem końcówkę butelki do nosa i po paru chwilach mówię sam do siebie: ""Oddychaj głęboko, nie zemdlej"".
Żadne słowa nie są w stanie opisać nawet części tego aromatu.
Kolosalna wanilia, przepotężny kokos, gigantyczne wpływy mokrej dębiny, drewna, zbutwiałych desek.
Nuty beczkowe paraliżują zmysły i wprawiają w osłupienie.
Po odkopaniu się spod tego ogromnego beczkowego pancerza powoli zaczynają docierać do mózgu inne aromaty. 
A jest tego co niemiara. Pokazuje się intensywna szwajcarska czekolada, pralinki z alkoholem w środku, nuty najlepszej na świecie kawy, melasy, brownie, ciasta typu murzynek, crème brûlée, panna cotta i cała masa innych znanych mi genialnych i słodkich deserów.
Miazga! Sztos! Niekwestionowane 10/10! 
 Smak:  Po pierwszym łyku odebrało mi po prostu mowę.
Bourbon zrobił tu tak nieprawdopodobną robotę.
Tony wanilii, kolosalny kokos, dębina, karmel, drewno, czekolada, belgijskie pralinki, kawa espresso, orzechy włoskie, bezy z ubitego białka, ponownie crème brûlée.
Czego tutaj jeszcze nie ma.
Tekstura zbita, oleista, gęsta jak kisiel.
Goryczka zaskakująco wysoka, ale krótka z orzechowo-kawowym tłem.
Niemal 11% alkoholu rozgrzewa w piersi i mile łechce podniebienie. Gładki, kremowy, aksamitny. Odczucie w ustach wręcz bajkowe.
Trunek arcymistrzowski, degustacyjny, wytworny. Sztos jakich mało! 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

31 grudzień 2016 -zapamiętam tę datę na długo. Po ponad setce wypitych RIS-ów odnalazłem
swój ideał stylu.
Black Note jest piwem WYBITNYM. 
Nigdy nie spotkałem na swojej drodze RIS-a tak złożonego smakowo i zapachowo, zarazem tak zbalansowanego, kremowego i z taką potężna beczkową wanilią i kokosem.
Piwo jest warte każdych pieniędzy. Jakbym tylko mógł wsiadłbym w samolot do USA i przemierzał całe Stany w poszukiwaniu tego trunku.

Nie ma nic lepszego niż zakończyć ten rok w tak spektakularnym stylu.

Życzę Wam wszystkim na ten Nowy Rok 2017, aby każdy z Was odnalazł swój ideał.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

1010,"2017-01-01",4.5,"12-ounce bottle pour from a four-pack I picked up as an Xmas gift to myself. Pours pitch black with a dark tan head that rapidly develops from the prickly natural carbonation, then quickly dissipates. Aroma is of prunes, dates, figs, smoke. Taste is all of these fruits, dried, with dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and a bourbon smokiness followed by a balancing hop bitterness (although still on the sweet side). Mouthfeel is slick, oily, creamy with medium-full body. A very goo bourbon-barrel-aged sweet stout. A noble cousin to Expedition Stout.","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"

Its that good. Black Note pours black with crimson highlights and basically no head at all (11.5% ABV). The aroma is huge bakers chocolate and vanilla. Big, rich, a lot of punch, just a tremendous smelling beer. The flavor is delicious. That chocolate and vanilla are right there, and the bourbon barrel comes through strong on the finish. Coffee and toffee notes, and roasted nuts are also a presence. This is fantastic beer.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"

From a vigorous pour, pitch black, used motor oil, nice tan head, fairly quickly dissiapating. Aroma is dark cacao nibs, coffee, roasted malt, sort of a silky tone, bourbon (but not overwhelming), very dark, roasted and velvety, some oak. Flavor is rich dark chocolate, velvety cocoa, light bourbon-barrel notes, coffee, bit of toffee, maybe a spot of cinnamon. This thing has crazy silky smooth mouthfeel. Id say the selling point here is mouthfeel. One of the smoothest bourbon barrel beers Ive had. Its very good, but I dont know that this thing is the best of the best.","New York, USA","SG111"
1010,"2016-12-29",3.7,"Bottled: 11/03/16, sampled: 12/28/16. Pours black but not very thick & oily. Almost no head but coats the glass with strands of lace. Aromas are soft & subdued; bourbons notes come through first and then chocolates, dried fruits, & coffee following. Arrives with nice oak, vanilla, and fruit notes; transitions into a malty middle backed up by coffee & caramel. Ends with bittersweet cocoa and booze. Doesnt warm up well; becomes too boozy, astringent, and sour. Finishes dry and long. Medium mouthfeel, no carb, and a moderate warmth of alcohol. Overall really delicious, complex, and balanced but wished there was more chocolate throughout. Not as amazing as it was hyped up to be but still a decent BBA imperial stout.","California, USA","beer_queue"

I like the aroma, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit, molasses, dark chocolate, and coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some caramel and burnt/charred malt noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.

1010,"2015-11-06",5.0,"Beer geeks around the world celebrated International Stout Day yesterday, so I decided to dig into the cellar to find one of the most exclusive ones I have left. I expect a lot from this one seen its reputation... Vintage bottle (2014). Loudly crackling, moussy, deep tan coloured head, retaining fairly well (even remaining completely stable around the edge) over an opaque and practically black, but actually very dark chestnut brown beer (becoming increasingly apparent as the glass is emptied) with visible fizz on the edges. Strong aroma upon opening the bottle, offering everything one expects from a barrel aged RIS: thick whiffs of dark chocolate, espresso gone cold, coffee beans even, hazelnut paste, sweet cherries soaked in brandy, wet leather, bourbon, vanilla-like oak, raisins, salmiak, chocolate cake dough, very old madera, candied dates, soy sauce, bayleaf, stewed beef, cloves, gingerbread, pear syrup, black olives, Cuban cigars, it just goes on and on. Intense, thick, extremely rich taste, opening with a restrained and refined, dense candied sweetness perfectly balanced with soy sauce-like umami flavours and a soft, generic sourishness; mouthfeel is expectedly big and oily, full-bodied yet still elegant and supple, with a finely tingling carbonation perfect for this style. A slight alcohol warmth can be felt at an early stage but is largely drowned in an abyss of malts, with delicious dark bittersweet chocolateness prevailing over toasty and nutty flavours and the coffeeish roasted bitterness gently and gradually building towards the finish. Ends in a big, thick wave of this black maltiness, with the initial sweetness discretely balanced by not just the black coffee bean-like roasted bitterness, but lovely oaky woodiness as well, supporting peppery hop bitterishness in the right place. Alcohol is evident, but feels like a good bourbon or even rhum rather than being brutal and blank; it brings a very agreeable wave of heat to the throat and chest without becoming obnoxious. Some sweetness lingers in the throat after swallowing but the roasted, hoppy and light alcohol bitterness dominate the aftertaste. The bouquet is just wonderful at cellar temperature and becomes even more enchanting, not to say addictive, at room temperature: this beer is completely flawless to me, I could not stop sniffing it for the whole duration of the tasting (of an entire bottle). Some other hyped American impies are equally impressive but are perhaps a tad too boastful; this one remains discrete and shows finesse and elegance galore. The sticky sweetness is exquisitely balanced, which is less the case in e.g. Dark Lord or Surlys Darkness; the wood and the bourbon add another layer of complexity without disturbing the equilibrium of the basic beers malty, hoppy and fruity properties. This is a lot like BCBS in many ways, with the same degree of drinkability; I already gave Bells Expedition Stout a near perfect score, and since this one ups the ante with the extra dimension of bourbon barrel ageing, I guess I have no choice but to honor this artful masterpiece with my first 5/5. Ive been struggling with this idea for a while all through the tasting, I tend to keep a kind of platonic viewpoint in believing a beer in the real world can never be completely perfect, but this one truly has it all, it has the looks, aroma, taste and feel of a perfect imperial stout. This is a divine beer in all respects and the perfect choice for celebrating something as geeky as an international beer style day, I guess...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Amazingly, the Hopslam kicked long before the Black Note, so I enjoyed three of these as I watched people go nuts for Hopslam. Big khaki head. Not a particularly dark head, though. Decent retention. Huge barrel aroma. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Roasted chocolate, but otherwise the stout is a touch lost in the barrel. Boozy, too.

Taste is chocolate and a building tingle of bourbon. Vanilla flavor throughout. The chocolate comes back in the finish in a much more bitter manifestation. Less boozy in the finish that the smell would indicate. Really wonderful incorporation of barrel and stout.
Very creamy, which I assume is the Cream Stout. Boozy and chewy, but not too thick. Low carbonation, which is strange. Nearly flat.

1010,"2015-06-21",4.4,"75 cl bottle, batch 11620, bottled dec 2012. Thanks to AdamJackson for trading this beverage. Pours black with a reddish hue, and no head. Aroma is bursting chocolate and raisins, very complex roasted malt is up yo face, beneath that, a destinct bourbon barrel aroma with tons of oak and vanilla is present, and even further down are notes of black tea, ripe cherry and espresso. Magnificent aroma. The taste is somewhat surprising. I was expecting a much fuller mouthfeel given the aroma, but the beer comes out very dry for the style, and somewhat of an alcohol burn. The taste has notes of dark cherries, bitter chocolate, oak and roasted malts. The finish is bitter, and the alcohol taste sticks in the mouth. I guess I had an idea that this would be a very heavy, viscous and creamy imperial stout, and instead it is more on the dry and well-attenuated side of the spectrum. Even though it is something completely different from my expectations, I am enjoying this beer a lot. The longer I keep it in the glass, the more it just explodes in complexity, and as it get some oxygen, the light mouthfeel actually becomes quite fitting for this beer.

I have had this a few times and I never liked it. Fortunately, blinded I still did not like it. Poured headless and thinnest of the beers available. I thought this was oxidized, got lots of woody notes, and rather acidic. In hindsight, seems like I was pretty on without picking up bourbon.
Despite me having this as one of my worst beers, everyone else enjoyed it. For the aggregate it scored highest and strongly above average (0.55 standard deviation above).

A creamy, ruby accented black pour, the foam minimal and chocolaty, rising anew with a twist of the fingers on the stem of the glass. The mesmerizing aroma is dark roast enveloped in deep, dark fruit; a rich, heady, woody accent with the essence of bourbon. This brew is so smooth that the flavors are a single experience, rather than a combination that you can peel apart without a thought. The palate is perfection for the body, not leaving you feeling flat, but miles away from buzzy.

1010,"2015-01-30",4.4,"Pours a viscous, black color, with a decent mohagony, bubbly head. It leaves back a thick, still bubbly lacing at the edge of the glass.

The nose reveals an astonishing balance between molasses, toffee, coconut, prunes and sweet milk chocolate on the one hand, and wooden, accentuating, slightly hot barrel qualities. The barrel is easily noteable on itself, while it hits the spot by supporting the malty aromas as well, in an outstanding, intriguing way.

Tastes earthier than the aromas revealed, with toasted, bready malts, accompanied by bakers chocolate and a decent amount of whipped cream. That creamy foundation then gets extended by cane sugar, big time toffee and molasses, which blend very well into the burning, wooden alcohol. Boozy Bourbon gets replaced by big chunks of wood, very chewy, with matured coffee beans, creating a pleasant balance, preventing this successfully from becoming too sweet and boozy.

The warmer the beer gets, the more present turns the Bourbon. It provides coconut and a hint of vanilla during the opening, while it becomes quite dominant, as the sweet malt qualities hit the tastebuds. Finishes with ash, scorched malts, slightly dry, while it remains its smooth, chocolate defined mouthfeel.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Split a bottle 3 1/2 ways last night, and will probably revisit when I have a full bottle, by itself, one day soon. My original impression, just from the the aroma was that this was leaning slightly more towards the Double Cream Stout than Expedition, and that turned out to be true in the flavor as well. But both beers are there, giving this a nice rich body, and layers of complexity. The barreling was also a little more prevelant than expected.

1010,"2014-04-03",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2014 Update:  The aroma on this is an 11+.  Seriously, the best aroma Ive experienced in an Imperial Stout.  +1 overall, +1 appearance..  This is a seriously good beer.  
2014 release. Pours a thick, oily dark brown, leaving a short-lived rich brown head. Aroma is outstanding, with sweet vanilla, light bourbon, earthy wood, dark fruit, and semi-sweet chocolate. Taste is creamy with chocolate, butterscotch, rich caramel up front. The sweetness is balanced with a more bitter chocolate in the middle, drying out with some resin, into slight alcohol warming, leaving a mellow cocoa toffee molasses aftertaste. This is really, really smooth. I have to do a side by side of this and Bourbon County Stout. From what I can recall, this is mellower, with just a bit less in-your-face flavor and richness, sacrificing that slightly to gain an unreal drinkability. I could have 4 of these in a row, and I cant say that about Goose Islands. Coffee is almost nowhere, replaced with a sweeter lactose flavors instead. More on my side of the spectrum in that regard. It could get cloying on the 2nd or 3rd bottle, but this beer is too expensive and rare to test that theory. Balanced, mellow, drinkable. This bottle is less than a month old. Any points Ive docked could very well be erased with aging. Well see!","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"

Cocoa, Licorice, Coffee, Brown Sugar, Vanilla, Honey, Leather and Bourbon. Wow! Wonderfully rich but not sticky thick. Great roundness of cream and sweetness with just a hint of oaky grainyness. Perhaps the best BA Stout Ive ever had. Just the right amount of everything Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Spice and Bourbon Barrel. The best part of this beer may be the lack of hot alcohol behind it to overpower it. I think it was listed as 11.something but it certainly doesnt present the alcohol in a manner where you guess that. Crazy long bittersweet finish that has an almost bizarrely familiar Cake Box Tobacco edge. This beer is the most perfectly executed BA Stout Ive ever found.

1010,"2013-12-30",3.9,"2012 bottle. Generously sent from Summer Secret Santa. The pour is black with a flimsy head on top that never fully develops. The aroma is of raisins, leather, light on the bourbon, some wood, and also a touch of licorice. Kind of underwhelming in that department. Warming, smooth, and silky in the mouth. Much more chocolaty than the scent had me thinking it would be, which was a good thing. Bourbon barrel notes, alcohol-soaked raisins, light sooty ash, and licorice provide some nice depth and a good blend of flavors. Some sticky sweetness in the finish is the only thing preventing this from being a very highly drinkable 10% beer. Not as big or creamy in the body as expected. A very good beer but probably a little over-hyped, as many barrel-aged Imperial Stouts seem to be.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, toast, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, light coffee, cream, raisin, licorice, light char, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, toast, toffee, oak, bourbon, clove, light coffee, cream, raisin, licorice, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors with very balanced barrel complexity; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a minimal warming present after the finish.

1010,"2013-10-06",4.4,"12oz 2012 bottle.
Aroma is fairly chocolates with a nice dark chocolate note and a lighter milk chocolate one. Moderate bourbon note and a nice vanilla aroma as well. Light roast and oak.
Pours black with a small, thick mocha head that quickly recedes leaving just a film on the edges. 
Flavor is similar to the aroma. Medium sweet chocolate character with a balance of dark and milk chocolate. Medium bourbon character with a nice vanilla note. Balanced bitterness. Lingering sweetness with some moderate alcohol spice. As it warms the fruit esters become more apparent with some nice plum, prune and fig notes.
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low to no astringency with medium alcohol warmth. Slightly sticky in the finish. 
Overall a very enjoyable imperial stout with a really nice vanilla character, and it pretty much lives up to the hype. The bourbon is light and complimentary and the vanilla is surprisingly strong. Not too big and sticky with nice fruit esters as it warms.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Smells of bourbon with a little oak and vanilla thrown into the mix.

There is a strong bourbon presence throughout the taste with vanilla and bitter roasted malts as well. Theres also a little bit of a smooth creaminess to it, Im guessing from the Double Cream Stout.

Thick and viscous mouthfeel. Lots of sludge.

Very good beer, but doesnt quite achieve Holy Grail status for me. The alcohol was not especially well hidden which I dont mind, but it knocks it down just a tick. A very good combo of two already good beers though and a very complex delightful treat.","Indiana, USA","jmarsh123"

Pours a deep dark brown with caramel head. First scent is the cream/vanilla, followed by malt. Very nice. 

Taste is a coordination of the bitterness of the Expedition with the sweetness of the double cream. It works well to offset the sickly sweetness of the Double Cream, but still very sweet.

1010,"2013-04-21",4.4,"12-oz. Second batch, bottled 12-28-12. Thanks, JA! Pours jet black with a dense and creamy dark tan head that sticks around forever and ever. Humongous bourbony nose hits you before you really even get your nose anywhere near the mouth of the glass. Sweet and chocolatey, lots of vanilla and apricots, theres coffee and prunes as well, but the predominant quality by far is the intensity of the oak and the bourbon without a doubt. Thick creamy body, almost sludgy, still showing carb--but its kind of a formality. Even if this were re-carbed, the density of the body would still keep this moving more like a creamy liqueur. So dont spend a lot of time thinking about them bubbles. The mid-palate is big and sweet and bourbony, oaky, showing lots of vanilla and apricots and some sharper phenolic bourbony notes. Then lots of coffee, chocolate, prunes, and other stout notes thunder past. Its big, heavy, complex, harmonious, just incredibly well done throughout. Lovely beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Absolutely wonderful with so many layers it just calls you to take another sniff. Mouth feel coats very well and it is rich and juicy with just enough carbonation to bring it all across. The flavor from both the rich malts and the barrel treatment are equally top notch and combine perfectly. Dark rich malts, sweet bourbon, hefty barrel wood, sticky molasses, coffee but with little bitterness, dark dried fruit, and a spicy hit of alcohol that is well within reason for such a big beer.

Overall this is a fantastic creation.
*Update. Aging the blacknote 2yrs has changed it minimally but what stands out the most for me is the finish. It has become slightly more bitter than I remember and it the dryness has increased.

1010,"2013-02-02",4.2,"Bottle from a PUB""R anonymous crack whore (under contract).  Pours thick oily jet black into my Stone RIS snifter with 1-finger tan head.  The head is loud, and says to me, ""How the hell did you find this beer in PA, you jerkoff?""  A good question, head.  Nose is huge and intense and complex; prunes, oaky bourbon, blackstrap molasses, blackberry, port, backup hops, and cognac.  Tastes rich, complex, hefty on the palate, with the oaky and bourbon/cognac flavor taking the forefront.  The palate heft is decreased, as we have seen with BA beers, and I dare say takes something away from this one, as it doesnt have that heavy smooth semi-sweet creaminess of the Expedition or the DC stout.  I put this one in the same genre as the 50/50 beers.  A very good beer, with the oak and spirits taking center stage.  In this case, those elements render the original beers unrecognizable for the most part, as such.  The finish gets more hoppy and charred dark malt, and a lot of scotch flavor arises, with the peaty elements coming through.  This one is a wonderful beer/spirit boundary breaker, but the 50/50s do it  too, and the Bells original beers are better.

I think the relatively low abv for a barrel aged stout really helps the complexity of this beer shine through.","","knickskicks"
1010,"2013-01-28",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2014 Bottle, bottled less than a month ago.  Feel very fortunate to nab one of these from the store.  Pours pitch black in color with almost no head.  Surprisingly not much lacing on the glass.  Aroma is dominated by bourbon but there are hints of vanilla and smoke.  Taste is slightly more balanced than the aroma.  Lots of vanilla and oak wood to balance a bit with the bourbon but the bourbon still overpowers some.  Finish is silky smooth with a nice booziness right at end.  Mouthfeel is a little thin but I like it here.  Overall, this is really good but Im a bit disappointed.  This lacks some complexity and I would prefer the bourbon to be a bit more subtle.  I cant taste the actual beer, all I get is bourbon and barrel notes.  Its the same way I feel about BCS.  I may have built myself up too much considering its ranked #10 overall beer in the world on this site.

Re-rate 5/3/14 - Fresh 2014 bottle.  Pours jet black with a very small thin ring of head.  Aroma is a nice mix of dark chocolate, bourbon, and dark fruit.  Taste is silky smooth bourbon with dark chocolate, tobacco, caramel, vanilla, and oak.  Love the mouthfeel.  Thick and full, silky smooth, and it goes down way too easy.  I enjoyed this more than 2014 KBS.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

Pours nearly pitch black - into a snifter. Surprisingly there is a dark brown head that sticks around for nearly the entire 50 minute duration of enjoyment. In the glass it is black as an eighth note (sorry). Gorgeous

The aroma is incredibly enticing, bringing you in with intensity and balance. Very prominent bourbon barrel characteristics - sweet vanilla and coconut, oak, and heat. Rich dark and milk chocolate and fresh coffee nearly dominate the dark fruits lying beneath. 

Tastes just as good as it smells. Big bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and sweet dark fruits. It is not a sweet bomb of a beer, there is some dryness. 

The mouthfeel is nearly full, soft carbonation and incredibly smooth. Very drinkable, do not feel the 11.8 abv at all, just a nice soothing warmth from the bourbon.

Alcohol is also evident in the nose. Tastes of coffee, dark dried fruits, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oakiness. Very well balanced and smooth. Not harsh at all, especially for being 11.5%. Nice aftertaste of vanilla that lingers in the mouth. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, velvety smooth and lightly carbonated. A world class beer from a world class brewery.","","ianhuntley73"

A: Pours a jet black with a light khaki head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to a thin collar that leaves some soapy looking lace across the glass.

S: Bourbon up front in the nose and slowly the dark fruits and pure chocolate start to emerge. As the glass warms the sweeter notes of caramel to show and the roasted malts also get amplified.

T: The dark fruits and the bourbon flavors are up front with smooth oak and a nice combination of dark chocolate and sweet milk chocolate. The finish is roasty with a nice addition of caramel and vanilla from the barrel.

M: Smooth and sweet with a low carbonation and chewier body. There is a mild warmth on the back end of each sip.

O: I really got the nice dark fruit and dark chocolate flavors from the Expedition Stout and the creamy malt and milk chocolate flavors from the Double Cream Stout. Overall, combined with the barrel aging this was a very nice beer.

1010,"2012-09-21",4.1,"750mL Bottle. A million, million thanks to Sean for providing this bottle to my Bachelor-party tasting of 2002-2012 Expedition Stout. It was a great way to kick the tasting off. Aroma resounded loudly with bourbon, pure and fresh, and soft. Hints of stout roast kick in, but its mostly a bourbon show. Flavors lean surprisingly in the Double Cream stout direction. I was picking up the mineral, charred Cedar saline quality of that portion of the blend, but lacking the rich, port-like refined sugar edge of the Expy. This is very dry for an Imperial Stout, which is greatly appreciated, but I think the bourbon is a bit overwhelming and I think the Expedition portion gets shouted out a little. Overall, its a very good stout and one that Im eternally grateful to have had the opportunity to try.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Pours basically black with a small but well retained head. 

The aroma is big & sweet with lots of fudge & bourbon notes. The alcohol is there in a pleasant bourbony kind of way, even fainter is a hint of smoke. 

The flavor is roasty and bitter, this is not without sweetness and lots of bourbon character, but this retains so much of whats great about the big awesomeness that is Expedition Stout. Plenty of chocolate, both in the dark bitter variety and the sweet fudgy variety. Some black currant and cherry fruitiness become more and more pronounced along with the woody character of the beer as it warms.

1010,"2012-06-24",4.5,"On draft at Churchkey in D.C.

The beer is black with a thin beige head. After a few swirls of the snifter the head expands to 3/4 inch, leaving a thick sheet of lacing cascading down the snifter.

The aroma, while nice, is quite a bit weaker than expected, offering bourbon and roast with a hint of vanilla.

The flavor, on the other hand, is a thing of beauty. Bold bourbon presence throughout. Oily thick with a delicious roast character. This is indeed a world class beer and in my top tier of barrel aged imperial stouts. Not terribly complex, per se, but masterfully balanced and just superb.

The mouthfeel is ridiculously good, perhaps the best I have yet encountered in a beer of this ilk. The Double Cream Stout shows itself here. Creamy and full bodied, with alcohol content gracefully disguised.

Worthy of its overall A+ rating, this beer was sublime.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
1010,"2012-06-19",4.4,"750mL courtesy of cavemanlawyer at a tasting. Big time thanks. Consumed on 6-16-12, reviewed from notes. 

A: Pitch black and all the poetry it implies. Aggressive poor yields some thin lacing, but not a great amount of head. Good carbonation bubbles.

N: Bourbon, honey, and some ethanol. Coconut, caramel, and vanilla. Really quite nice. 

T: Roasted coffee and malt. Bourbon is integrated well into the main body, leaving the normal descriptors of vanilla/caramel/oak. Im getting plenty of chocolate and some molasses, licorice, and a mystery flavor which kscaldef jogged out of my head as candied pecans. Theres still some heat here, though. 

M: This is coating without being cloying. A very impressive example of what I want in my RIS. 

O: There were a couple of beers that I never thought would be bottled and would thus not make it to the PNW via trades. This was one, the other was CBS. CBS was a big letdown; this is not. Well worth seeking out.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

1010,"2012-05-02",5.0,"Bottle courtesy of rayl101, thanks a ton dude! this is a great beer. took me a second to realize it was a five, but its so damn complex. just the aroma had me sniffing for a while, starts with a good dose of sweet vanilla, bourbon, earthy wood transitioning into espresso, plums, figs, dried black cherries and semi sweet chocolate; literally to name a few. i feel that aroma is the hardest category for me to give a perfect on, and this fit the bill immediately. the pour is pitch black, small dark brown head, but it has a most desirable quality that whenever you swirl it you get some head resurfacing. i used a CBS snifter, which is huge and can kill a low carb beer. this beer had enough carb in the mouthfeel and still kept a steady torrent at every swirl to release the aroma to the last sip. The taste is just awesome. i wasnt even really trying to tell what parts were expedition like and which were double cream like, standalone its just such an excellent flavor that you dont even have to think about it to give it a perfect score. theres so many layers of awesome: different chocolates of varying degrees, dark pitted fruits like cherries, figs, dried apricots, and even prunes in a good way, cold extract coffee, premium espresso, iced caramilla swirl latte, chicory, mesquite, oak, smoke, tar, resin, that black bourbon goo candy that seeps out of the barrel as you age it, burnt marshmallow, and so many more. Its just so damn complex and tasty and  blissful. the mouthfeel is better than you could hope. there is only really a few big stouts out there that truly pull off this level of palate. its full and rich and unwavering and yet its super creamy and smooth. Theres a chocolate milk aftertaste that makes you feel like a kid wishing for another shorty carton in elementary school. this is more of an old school 5.0, if that makes sense.","Notown, California, USA","wavers1"

Essentially it tasted like a well aged, more creamy and slightly less bitter version of the Expedition which in my opinion is the best six pack stout ever made.  The vanilla and caramel from the barrel shows up in the flavor with excellent layers of over ripe fruit, chocolate and roasted malt. Enjoyed the bitterness that was always lingering in the background without interfering with all of the other complexities of the beer.  Perfect heft on the palate for the style with a slightly creamy texture and a light carbonation.  Finished with a fantastic blend of wood and malt that left me craving another sip.

1010,"2012-03-07",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/29/2011.  Served on tap in a cervoise at the Great Taste of the Midwest. I have anticipated trying this for three years, so needless to say, I am excited. 

My pour is an ebony black color with a modest creamy tan head. As I would expect with the high ABV, the cap fades rather quickly and leaves just a few dots of lace on the glass.

The aroma does not jump out of the glass, but it is full and complex. Lots of roasted malt and chocolate fudge are noticeable, with coffee and cream, subdued bourbon notes, and some raisins or other dark fruits as well. 

The blend here is just fantastic. It is difficult to describe the intricacy of the interaction of the flavors, but I will do my best. A light bourbon presence exists throughout, so each flavor melds in with that base. Full, deep, almost burnt roasted malt create the deepest bitterness and set the tone for the rest of the flavors. The taste lightens up with some creamy coffee notes. Still bitter, but light and creamy as well. From there, gooey fudge makes an appearance, sticking with a full creamy flavor. The bitter, creamy, and sweet flavors all work well with the bourbon to create different sensations. Some vanilla, oak, molasses, and anise add even further complexity.

The mouthfeel is luxuriously thick and creamy. Using double cream stout really smooths out any rough edges in the feel. Lightly sticky sweet, a touch of oaky dryness toward the end. Creamy carbonation, a deceptive lack of alcohol presence, and a full body. 

Wow, this is pretty incredible. This is definitely an artful blend of two already good beers. The result capitalizes on the strengths of both beers - creamy and roasty, with the perfect amount of bourbon to blend everything together. This was tapped right as the rain started to come down at GTMW, so it was easy to get several pours as long as you were willing to venture out into the rain. Worth every effort to get it, and I would recommend putting forth any effort necessary to try this beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Flavor of bourbon, vanilla, toffee, molasses, toasted oak, plum, dates, coffee, and ash. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, warming mouthfeel that finishes dry and roasty.

The flavor is absolutely mindblowing; huge creamy vanilla up front mixes with bourbon wood in the middle, then shifts to ashy roast with a brilliant roasty dry finish. The mouthfeel is super creamy and luscious, but with enough effervescence to aid that bitterness. The most impressive part about this beer is that you can taste the amazing contributions of the Double Cream, the bourbon barrel, and the Expedition all separately (and in that order, I would argue), but it is also incredibly integrated as its own entity. Absolutely divine.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Toasted coconut. Let it decant to cinnamon ganache and very subtle meat/umami character. Soft booziness, coffee liquor. So many rich subtleties makes this an incredible experience. Taste is similar to normal and Rare Bourbon County Stout. Super creamy, rich coconut oil mouthfeel. Feels less sharply bitter than normal Expy. Softer and easier to love than normal Expy. Superlative soft mouthfeel. Nice bitterness comes through to cut initial sweetness. Great mouthfeel- mild heat reminds of soft bourbon aging but softness is unreal. Roasty bitterness and coffee character hints that this is not BCS but something else. Very beautiful. Complexities are easier to fall in love with than normal Expedition which can be too aggressive  and powerful at times.

Black in the glass with a tiny dark brown head that rapidly recedes to a ring.

The aroma is woody and earthy, with a backbone of bittersweet chocolate. Boozy bourbon is present but more subtle than I was expecting, and sweetness is very reserved. Expeditions unmistakable burnt licorice/molasses character shines through with surprising strength here.

The taste is impressively complex; licorice up front, burnt whole grain bread, bakers chocolate, tobacco, vanilla and light earthiness. Rich and full-bodied without much sweetness. Hot bourbon flavors come through more in the finish, along with woody tannins, strong burnt bitterness and lingering espresso.

N.B. This was listed as ""BB Double Cream Stout"", but Larry Bell assured everyone it was the blend and that the erroneous name was merely due to a label approval issue.

A - A half-finger of dark mocha foam with solid retention, and a little bit of lacing. Pitch black - there was no trace of color, even at the fringes. Its about what I expect from a high gravity Imperial Stout.

S - Tons of bourbon and vanilla notes, a bit of roastiness - it wasnt the most complex nose. I even patiently waited for it to warm up, as it was served WAY too cold, but I didnt really get much more than the basics here.

T - The taste was superb, and was somewhat shocking after the lukewarm aroma. Tons of bourbon, vanilla, sweet malts, milk chocolate, a bit of dark fruit and barrel, and what I suspect is the beginnings of some lacto-sour barrel bacteria (which at this stage makes the brew more interesting and isnt really a negative). I love the way the Double Cream Stout portion offsets the roasty bitterness and acidity. As a result the aftertaste is surprisingly mild.

M - Mild carbonation, super smooth, lighter in body than I expected (more medium-to-full). Plenty of residual stickiness in this one, and shockingly a bit of heat (even after a couple years in the keg).

D - Super drinkable for what it was - the multiple tasters went down pretty easy. I think out of the ten tickets my wife and I got, we used at least half of them on this superb brew. The only problem is the ABV, and is that really that big of a problem? ;-)","Chicago, Illinois, USA","MasterSki"

I should begin by saying that I am not a fan of Expedition which puts me in the minority group on this site.

The aroma is a wonderful blend of dark chocolate, espresso, bourbon notes, sweet cream, and nice roasted malts.  The flavor is every bit as impressive:  rich chocolate, vanilla, espresso notes, vanilla, bourbon infused wood, with a sweetness that is balanced by bitterness.

1010,"2009-11-19",4.5,"I was very excited to have this on tap at Bells All Stouts Day on 11/1/09 known as Black Note and weighs in at 11% ABV.

I had two 8 oz. pours of this delicous brew, but Ill do my review off of my first pour which was into a small 8 oz. snifter.

Black Note pour a deep black with a thin tan head that dissipated quickly. Smells of bourban, wood, chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt dominate the nose. I will say that the nose definetly improves as the beer warms. It was actually a bit difficult to smell all the subtle details when the beer was cold, but as it warms the smell does really shine through. The taste is amazing, a great blend here to be sure as the sweet, sharp molasses charector of the Expo stout is balances perfectly by the creamy smooth mouthfeel of the double cream stout. Flavors up front are of chocolate, wood, vanilla and molasses with hints of lactose sweetness. The finish is dominated by a sweet chocolate, bourban flavor. The layors of this stout are quit impressive and for 11% this is sooo drinkable. On a cold winter day I could drink this all day with out one regret. I feel very fortunate to have been able to try this beer as I know supplies are running very low, but I have to say that this is one of the best blended, barrel aged stout combinations that I have ever had. I think to myself this is such a great idea by Larry and the guys at Bells I wish they would do a second batch because this beer makes me happy to be alive...well worth the drive and the wait.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","HopHobo"

A - Pours black with a thin tan head. Even though theres only a small ring of head around the edge of the glass, theres a good amount of lacing draped along the sides.

S - Sweet chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, light bourbon, some oak/wood. As it warmed up (and I made it to my second glass), things picked up even more.

T - Just outstanding! Lots of sweet milk chocolate mixed with the perfect amount of bourbon. Much like drinking chocolate syrup mixed with a kick of bourbon and some expresso beans.

M - Not quite as think as I was expecting, but doesnt detract much at all from this beer. Very little carbonation, just right for the style.

The mouth feel is oily and lush, coats the palate but is not as heavy as your basic Expedition stout, nicely warming without becoming boozy. Wow,this is everything it has been made out to be.

1010,"2009-11-08",4.5,"Cant believe I got to try this.  FoBAB 2009.  Aroma of cream, coffee, chocolate and bourbon.  The bourbon is just a player here in the symphony.  hops are tnere too.  Such a creamy delicious beer.  Basically, beyond the hype, or hype proof.  This is the real deal.  Some liquid smoke and meat, some meaty chocolate. Chocolate covered bacon? sure.  This beer is so comfortable, it had nothing to prove.  About as awesome as it gets.  This beer is like telling a chef youre not much into dessert and they try to prove you wrong.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
1010,"2009-11-04",4.8,"#300...Insanely blessed to try this absolutely incredible beer.  On tap at Stub and Herbs, this poured a pitch black with a nice tan head and left a nice lacing.  Aroma is incredibly complex:  coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon and floral hops.  Flavor is a beautifully balanced sweet.  The palate is insane; creamy, thick, rich, lush...just flat out amazing.  This beer exceeds the hype.","Bemidji, Minnesota, USA","kosko20"
1010,"2009-11-04",4.2,"Very stouty aroma sweet but try with some liquor like hints. Amazing mouthfeel, very soft but a nice medium-heavy weight. Chocolate, some bitter roasty flavours. Its like a nice hoppy batch of expedition stout with a hint of mellow added....not like a big expedition mellowed out, but its like a separate component of the beer. It feels a little boozy without being really alcoholic, reminds me of a good scotch or bourbon in that respect. Pretty interesting beer overall, well done and has some nice flavours. However, its not  top 50 beer....","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

Aroma doesnt get much better; if I wasnt so excited to get this one I could have just sat and smelled this all night.   Lots of bourbon, dark roasted malts, espresso, creamy chocolate, and vanilla.  Flavor is fantastic as well and is everything you get out of the smell and more.  The sweetness of everything works so well with the bourbon.  This is extremely well balanced and everything seems to complement each other.  This one lives up to all the hype and then some!  I only hope I can get more of this sometime sooner rather than later.","Waunakee, Wisconsin, USA","MrPickles"

Lots of bourbon barrel, vanilla, espresso, and some ultra dark chocolate, maybe some chocolate pudding as well. The mouthfeel on this thing is ammmmaaaazzziiingggg. Makes expedition feel like grainy water in comparison. Flavor isnt too shabby either. The double cream stout really shines through, lots of barrel character, dark chocolate, and roasted dark malts. Really amazing beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"
1010,"2009-10-27",4.1,"(on tap at Stub and Herbs) Pours black with a thin tan head that rings around the highball glass that I wish were a snifter instead.  Aroma wasnt too impressive, but it contained the standard BA impy fare, with some vanilla, chocolate, roasted malt, and raisin as well.  The taste was quite good with some milk chocolate, handi-snacks chocolate pudding, vanilla, light roasted malt, coconut, raisin, and some charred barrel on the finish.  What really sets this beer apart from other BA imp. stouts is the mouthfeel which is incredibly smooth, rich, and full.  If I could give the palate a higher score I would.  A good beer, but not as great as I was expecting.  Hopefully I can re-rate a larger sample in a snifter sometime in the future.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Our waitress was right on this one and did a great job securing a table of ratebeerians with a 7 oz sample of this brew.  Later on, I witnessed a beer being Factoed by an unnamed source, ha!  One of the smoothest palates of any beer Ive put to my lips.  Tobacco, licorice, lactose, chocolate, bourbon...a lot going on here.  Well balanced, as none of the flavors overpower.  Fairly impressive, although I have to admit when it comes to impy stouts, this isnt quite my bag of tea.  But I can see how some might be blown away by this beer.

Theres sweet bourbon and vanilla -- not cloying, but pleasant. Taste is smooth, with nice roast. Tons of vanilla, caramel, raisins, and muted bourbon. The finish is pleasant, and leaves a sweet milkiness in the mouth. Definitely felt like I was chewing this one. I think the blend works here, and brings the best elements of each of the two beers. The bourbon barrel seemed to iron out any of the rough edges, as there was none of the harsh, bitter flavors that can sometimes come through with Expy. Very, very nice.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

The aroma shows its Expedition roots, with notes of decadent, fudgy, chocolate cake, scorched caramel, espresso roast, and anise all showing strong. Peppery, toasted oak and subtle whiskey kick things up nicely, while lactic sugars and a milky element borrow from the Double Cream stout. licorice, figs, dates, and raisin lend incredible depth and complexity. Flavors basically mirror the nose, insanely chocolaty and bittersweet, with massive espresso roast and earthen hops for balance. Soft whiskey and woody vanilla are soothed and massaged by the creamy sugars, all coming together to form a creme brûlée and bourbon-soaked fruit finish. The palate is heavy and velvety, well carbonated but just a bit overly hot and sharp. One hell of a fireside slow sipper, this massive brew is  as decadent as they come. Delicious stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1010,"2009-02-24",4.3,"In short: A big creamy chocolate stout with strong vanilla presence and a light bourbon character.  Excellent, just not best-of-the-best as ratings indicate
How: Tap. EBF 2009.  Multiple samples
The look: Black body topped by a large tan head
In long:  To start with, lets make one thing clear: the current average of this beer is because of rarity-tickers, not product quality.   That being said the beer is excellent, just not Expedition-excellent.  Because of the name I expected a bourbonized Expedition Stout but this beer turned out to be more closely related to the Bells Batch 7000.  I slightly preferred the Batch 700 over this one.  Black chocolate and creamy nougat, light-medium bourbon character, a little bit too much vanilla, body a bit thinner than Batch 7000 or Expedition, limited hops presence.  Not aggressive or boozy, really easy to drink.  Doesnt feel very sweet either.  Kick-ass brew but Ill take a $2 Expedition any day over this one.  Seeing as it had been retired for a while I didnt think I was going to come across it.

1010,"2009-02-20",4.5,"2/6/09 @ The Brew Kettle:  If you missed this one, it sucks to be you!  Outstanding beer to say the least.  Its just as black as the originals w/ a short lived tan head.  Light on the roast and bourbon, heavy on the chocolate and vanilla.  Caramel, brown sugar, oaky wood, raisiny dark fruit and a very slight herbal hop nose all blended in a parade for the the olfactory senses.  The flavor is much the same with a touch of alcohol.  Balance is to sweet with a semi sweet finish with a light bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate aftertaste.  When the nose screams ""here it comes"" the mouth begins to water for this well made elixer.  Warming alcohol, full body, low CO2 with a creamy smooth mouthfeel.  Very complex and robust!  More oustanding than each separately, which are two really good beers in their own rights.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

Thanks to bdigi66 for giving me a heads up that this beer is available and also to Greg at Trion for giving those of us who enjoy good beer an opportunnity to partake in this beer!! Small bubbly light brown head that mostly diminished, opaque, no visible carbonation, fair amount of lacing, and a black hue. The aroma is very much bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, roasty, and dark fruits. Nice! The bourbon takes its place in the frontseat in the flavor, roasty, vanilla, oak, little hoppiness and dryness to the finish. Very, tasty indeed! Tingly, medium-full bodied mouthfeel.

Nose is heavy on the bourbon with lovely vanilla bean, chocolate, black cherry, toffee and lactose notes to back it up.  One thing that really stood out about this is that you can really distinguish the blend...their definitely was a nice hoppiness to the finish, leading me to believe that the Expy portion was fresh.  Flavor was mainly bourbon, vanilla, coffee bean and finished with a dry, oaky AND hoppy kick.

1010,"2009-02-07",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2012 draft at Trion tavern in New Haven, IN... theyre almost out  - Pours black with a thin tan head.  The aroma is big on the bourbon with oak notes and has some roast chocolate malt in the background.  The flavor is also full of bourbon and its good bourbon.  The roast malt takes a backseat, but its there.  There are also notes of oak, vanilla, and mocha.  Its full bodied and lingers pleasantly on the palate with good bitterness coming through in the finish.  My only change would be to tone down the bourbon just a little so the other flavors can come out more.  That could drive this up to a 4.4 or higher for me.  I hear Indiana only got maybe three quarter casks, so it was great to try it.

Had it again on tap in Nov 2012 at Club Soda - Inky black, very small tan head, strong bourbon aroma. Big flavor of bourbon with massive roast malt. Very full bodied. Sweet.

1010,"2009-01-20",3.7,"Got to try this on tap at the Bells tasting at Studio 35 on Indianola Ave., 1-18-09. A little too cold to get much of aroma. Initial heat up front; bourbon barrel, but not exactly outspoken. Quite thick and viscous, maybe more so than the regular Expedition. Sweet. Creamy. Leafy hop in the middle. I like this but it does seem somewhat overhyped for whatever reason. Some batches of regular Expedition are better for instance. So I feel a little bad giving a 3.7 to such a highly rated hard to find retired beer, even though it was really cool to get to try this (apparently only 4 quarter casks total made it into Ohio, and I think just 1(?) at this tasting). Lot of props to the Bells beer reps for this.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","minch25"
1010,"2008-08-30",4.2,"Part of our hotel room tasting, GABF 2007. Thanks to whoever brought it (might have been cquiroga, maybe Captain Cougar; there were so many generous benefactors, and all the beers were just chillin’ in the tub, it was impossible to keep track).  Smell:  wow.  Bourbon + imitation vanilla your mom uses for baking + liquid creamy chocolate; the bourbon is so nice and fruity, not dominated by oily alcohol aromas.  Pours pitch black like normal Expedition, with crumbling oily lacing.  Super full bodied.  Taste features a creamy lactic sweetness over full rich malts of toffee, chocolate; a bitter, dry, and musty finish is full of hops, but it’s layered and variable, it keeps changing: starts earthy and dusty, then becomes coffee-ish in the rich bitterness, then settles into a weird sour hops after effect, which was weird and soured me on the beer.  To bad it was the last impression.  This is a monster, but I think I might still just prefer regular Expedition.  I’m growing tired of barrel aging.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of coffee liqueur, bourbon and toasted malt. Rich, chewy body with loads of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate flavor, as well as bourbon and plum. The finish is roasty and sweet at first with mild alcohol and coffee in the aftertaste. Very enjoyable, and a close second to the Bourbon Barrel Java Stout at this event.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1010,"2008-03-08",4.2,"On tap at the Bells dinner at Brews.  Dark beer with a thin brown head that shank to a whispy film pretty quickly.  The bourbon barrel flavors are much more subtle in this mix then in the Third Coast Old Ale or the Java.  The bourbon is still a strong flavor, with oak, vanilla, coffee, some bitter chocolate and some dark juicey fruits as it warms.  This beer comes with a lot of hype and while it didnt rock my world, for a beer with so many stong flavors everything balances and blends with finesse.   This is a great example of how a barrel and two beers can be combined to make an excellent drink.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
1010,"2008-03-08",4.5,"#500. Draft.  Pours pitch black with a surprisingly sturdy dark brown head.  As soon as I smelled this I knew my hopes were not going to be let down.  Super rich, thick chocolate aroma complimented (not overpowered) by a strong vanilla, oaky bourbon note that melds nicely.  Coffee, dark fruits, marshmallow are also noted, all being weaved together nicely.  This smells remarkably similar to Goose Islands BCS, one of my favorite beers.  Thankfully this tastes as good as it smells.  Rich, full bodied and sticky with that super roasty flavor of Expedition being in the forefront, though calmed from its time in the barrel and the addition of the bourbon and vanilla flavors.  I want to say this has a chocolate flavor and aftertaste but really it is more like fudge.  Again, the bourbon is a strong component in the flavor but it doesnt overpower.  The body is full and chewy though obviously a little less than the regular Expedition.  I taste a lot more Expedition than Double Cream.  I wondered why they even bothered to blend the two because an oak-aged Expedition sounded better to me but I think the DC cuts out some of the intense roastiness and bitterness of the Expedition and lends a nice drinkability to this.  This is certainly one of the best barrel aged beers Ive tried, I might like the BCS just a tad more though this is certainly less hot and more drinkable.  Either way this is just spectacular.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Poured a very dark viscous black with a very roasty and toasted brown head that receded after a short little while.  The nose of this beer is top notch...filled with aromas of wood tannins, vanilla, roastiness, marshmallow, and some bourbon.  The flavor profile is unbelievably good.  Some borubon, some woodsy flavors, lots of roasted dark malts, some chocolate, coffee, and some darker fruits even make their presence known.  The alcohol was not all that overbearing for such a big brew, and it was really quite welcoming in this fantastic sipper of an imeprial stout.  The blending of both the expedition and double cream stout left the palate and mouthfeel of this beer ever so creaming and rich.  A really really fantastic beer!!","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"

Poured pitch black with a thin dark tan head that was gone in a minute, never to return even after a big swirl in the snifter.  Strong booze aroma, and not much else, a little roast, vanilla, but  mostly bourbon.  Smooth, robust flavor, not as bourbony as the aroma would indicate. Flavors of vanilla, oak, dark roasted coffee, rum soaked pit fruits.  An absolutely delicious beer.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth for such a large beer, no doubt due to the blending of the Double Cream with the Expedition.

1010,"2008-01-07",3.9,"Hand-bottle from Maniac, I guess about a week old now. Unlike Hopscotchs, mine is completely flat, although there was a small burst of CO2 when I opened the bottle. Does not taste oxidized at all. Flavor is a hefty bourbon and stout kick, with a thick, cool body that makes your throat sweat. Nose is heavy bourbon and cheese, grassy, pretty different. To me, this is a solid beer, but the bourbon is a bit powerful and the beer lacks the finesse of either expedition or double cream.

All the bitter, rough edges of the traditional version of Expedition Stout are mellowed, if not completely washed away, via blending and oak aging the two base beers.

Smells pretty powerful with a good amount of bourbon, and a pretty big dose of chocolate.  Some sweet, syrupy dark malts, light molasses, and sweet sugars all about rounded out the aroma.  The flavor had pretty big chocolate, although the bourbon was more subdued in the flavor making it very creamy.  Its bark was worse than its bite seemingly.  It made it incredibly drinkable and still had good flavor going on.  The carbonation was not low, but seemingly had lost a little of its sting.  pretty chocolatey throughout especially in the finish and lingering aftertaste.

Aroma is tons of black licorice, toffee, chocolate, coffee and cream- hints of vanilla, and dominant chocolate liquor and smooth mellow bourbon.  Great luscious dark chocolate flavors, tons of coffee, tar and tobacco with lots more licorice, vanilla, very light oak, but moderate bourbon character.  Smooth as hell on teh finish.  Awesome beer! I liked this one better than the batch 7000 BA, but after drinking the 7000, and coming back to this, my mouth had been destroyed by the power of 7000 and thus on the second time the flavors seemed more subdued.

1010,"2007-12-04",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2013 Pours with a dark brown color to the body and a thin tan, medium dark brown head, with some reddish light at the top and bottom of the glass.  First taste is bourbon up front, with a very vivid and fresh mocha, cream and butter note, turning almost spicy on the palate mid-drink.  Its at first rich and sweet, with candied milk and sweet mocha from the Double Cream, followed by the dark fruit skins and bitter bakers chocolate that make Expedition so wonderful.  The bourbon is somewhat subdued, probably helped by the lower alcohol level compared to the more boozy BA Batch 7000, but its the charred malt and dark chocolate with the rich and slightly sweet cream notes that just make this beer amazing.  When warm it finishes with a heavier chocolate syrup note with the bourbon being somewhat more subdued.  An amazing beer, with both parts of the blend working so well together, and a barrel character that compliments fully and takes nothing away.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

A light jolt of citrus, almost indiscernable at the front, followed by huge, chewy roasted coffee and nougats and milk / dark chocolate; incredibly chewy, viscous chocolate and chewy malt core, with a decent, if relaxed, buttery bourbon and lightly toasted oakiness; lots of coffee and less bourbon than BA Batch 7000.

Big milk chocolate and nougat aroma with an expansive, vegetal warmth of full roasted coffee bean; hints of raspberry, ground honey grahams and quieted bourbon barrel.  Taste is decidely quite reserved, showing a fair strength of bitterness and earthy tone; sumatran coffee and sprucewood, with a bold, wet tobacco acridity underneath.     Altogether restrained and surprisingly quite delicate; drying cinnamon, charred malts and fruit tones in blackberry and apple warm the back end.  It isnt especially viscous or overpowering in the mouth, though still commanding and full-bodied.  Caramel sweetness and acidic black cherry skin pulse in a long finish; lots of traditional mocha foam and chocolate layer thickly as it warms.  Pleasant, and confidently sophisticated in its reserved and educated presentation; though it stays quite quiet throughout, it never concedes even the slightest bit of strength.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1010,"2007-08-27",4.8,"GTMW07- In my opinion the star of the show and the Bells beer line. As ""waldo"" was saying on the bullhorn ""perhaps the best beer Bells has ever made"". Id agree. Everything I love about both beers with the added robust bourbon flavor. It works with the beer, not against it. Its the harmony of the 2 beers and wood that makes this so special.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
1010,"2007-08-17",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2008 On tap at GTMW 2007
As I was walking back to my seat to get a respite from the heat I heard the megaphone at the Bells booth say something about Expedition.  I immediately made a beeline to discover a small keg of this on tap.  Never one to miss an opportunity I asked for a pour which they gave rather generously.  I was actually hoping this would make the trip as I love the regular Expedition and also wanted to compare it to last nights BA Batch 7000.  It loses by just a hair though I still loved the complexity.
Revisited February 17, 2008 at the Buckeye Beer Engine - This was every bit as good as I remembered.  Even at $6.00 a snifter it was reasonably priced.  Having it in the proper glass really enhances the experience.  I would recommend that if you hear of this being tapped you make the effort to get there.
Aroma / Appearance - A reddish brown body with a tan head is a mix of Expedition and Double Cream.  It smelled of oak and vanilla which were from the barrel, cream from the Double Cream and anise and coffee donated from the Expedition.  If I had to guess it was a 55/45 mix based on the blending of aromas.
Flavor / Palate - Creamy oatmeal, maltiness and anise are the first things to cover the palate.  Raisins, plums and blackberries come next before the alcoholic bite detracts slightly.  A vinous finish caps the experience which was over far too shortly.  That is the one drawback to festivals - I had to rush through this in less time than I wanted or miss out on the BA Darkness soon to be tapped.  Still it contributed to the cost of admission quite well.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1010,"2007-08-16",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2008 Hand bottle from Shigadeyo: Pours black with a small head. Aroma, bourbon, some chocolate, and some lactose. Flavor, oaky, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and some of the Double Creams creamy texture, the hand bottle was a little flat, but it didnt detract too much.


Re-rate (2/13/08): On tap at Buckeye Beer Engine: Pours a thick black with a small tan head. Aroma, bourbon and chocolate, roasted malts, some sugars, vanilla. Flavor, roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate. Smooth and thick with a sweet roasty finish that rounds out nicely with the bourbon. Much better when properly served, very glad I got the chance to re-rate it.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
1010,"2007-08-16",4.6,"Draft @ GTMW I had two full pours, better than 10oz I would guess. Notes took a back seat to tasting and bsing with the other RB fellas there. Bourbon barrel aroma. Taste is expedition + oak & bourbon with a little cream stout. (For further detail on the taste, look up my reviews of each, mix them up and add oak and bourbon) Good stuff.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
1010,"2007-08-14",4.5,"Opaque and black with a frothy tan head rising prophetically. Balanced vanilla beans and bourbon aromatically dance with chocolate and sweet mocha grinds while Madagascar vanilla and caramelized hazelnuts rhythmically fornicate through all nose sockets. Full bodied flavor strikes aggressively and splendidly balanced. Roasted espresso grinds titillate the tongue. Bourbon hides under the semi-sweet dark chocolate coating that encapsulates the espresso bean. Thick oily fluid ripples throughout as the mocha grind bitterness tittles at the tip of the tongue. Dark chocolate manifests more as we delve deeper into the glass. The no bake dark chocolate brownies provide an everlasting surplus in the finish, complimented by a tenderly sentimental vanilla, bourbon and mocha bean signature at the end. Glad I was able to thank Laura Bell with a hug when she brought this beer into my world in abundance at GTMW.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1010,"2007-08-14",4.3,"GTMW. One of the best beers of the day, but who expected anything else? Poured out of a mannequin dressed as Waldo, which was quite the sight. What impressed me most about this beer was the mouthfeel -- viscous, chewy, and yet somehow also silky and creamy. Notes of cocoa dust, light roast coffee, whole milk, vanilla, and cedar. Finish was sweet and satisfying. Well done, Mr. Bell!","Illinois, USA","Philip"
1010,"2007-08-13",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2009 I got to try this again at the Darkness Eve party at Stub and Herbs.  Much better than I remembered.  Killer nose.  Luscious.  Bourbon is tasty.  Bumping this up a bit.
On tap at the GTMW
Dense black with a large brown head.  Sweet chared sugar with chocolate, coffee, and roasted character.  The flavor is a nice coco/bourbon mix.  Lush, rich, and a dry finish finish this off.  I dont seem to be as high on this as most.  Still really good beer.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1010,"2007-08-13",4.7,"On tap at GTMW, 2 full glasses worth.  This was one of those weekends where a brewer went above and beyond, exceeding its already sky-high expectations, to dismantle and re-create my Top 10 list.  Poured jet black with an explosive creamy cap of deep beige head.. highly viscous, clinging to the glass at every opportunity.  The aroma was just heavenly (although in a deep, dark, and seductive way).. sweet, well-roasted dark chocolates (some darker and some cocoa) waft across the nose and are hit by a sweet bourbon and vanilla crosswind, with vanilla interplay from the Double Cream and the barrel.. toasted oak adds even further complexity.  Couldnt ask for anything more or different!  The flavor had a rich base of moderately-roasted milkier and darker chocolates accented by lightly-charred oak.. the barrel influence was not very pronounced, but did impart some sweet vanilla and even less bourbon on the latter half of the drink.. long and wonderful finish of sweet and roasty chocolates and a mild oaky sourness.. Amazing!  Heavily-bodied with a perfect blend of the Expedition and Double Cream as well as a brilliantly soft, but certainly noticeable barrel influence on the beer. I hope to all the higher powers that I get to try this again!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1010,"2007-08-12",4.6,"On tap at Great Taste.  Dark thick color.  Smell of bourbon, vanilla, tons of chocolate, hops, candy, dark fruit, caramel and hops.  Again, Bourbon dominates this one but right behind is the chocolate.  I beleive I had this one before the 6000 was tapped.  When I came back they had the 2004 Eccentric on tap.  Anyways, Taste of bourbon, malt, lots of chocolate, hops, vanilla, oak, toffee/caramel, sugar and alcohol.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
1010,"2007-08-12",5.0,"Multiple 6 ounce glasses at the 2007 GTMW.  The beer was simply marvelous.  A huge active murky black body with a huge nice brown active thick head.  The beer was aromatic with chocolate, charred wood, smoke, and brown sugar.  Sweet and creamy.  The flavor was a deep molasses and chocolate nicely blended with a charred wood and brown sugar.  The sweetness on this one is large.  A long flavorful finish pervades the senses.  The beer has a full body and oily and creamy mouthfeel.  Simply divine.  My only perfect beer to date.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1010,"2007-08-08",4.3,"From a 12oz Handbottle.  Generously shared by cquiroga.  Tasted side by side with a batch 6811 Expedition Stout for a point of reference.  Mostly opaque, deep black colored pour with edges of tannic mahogany and a thin layer of creamy tan head.  A distinct bourbon barrel character that reminds me of baked salty pretzel instantly leaps from the aroma.  This surrounds a hint of smoke and a vanilla cream reduction.  Buttery toffee (no diacetyl), caramel syrup, and freshly baked doughy bread adds further complexity.  Im not getting much Expedition Stout in the nose - this smells about exactly the way Id expect a bourbon barrel double cream stout to smell.  This, I might add, is a good thing.  Medium full bodied, creamy mouthfeel.  The flavors start out with a chewy center of toffee, dipped in caramel, surrounded by a shell of milky vanilla chocolate.  The barrel characters start to open up a bit more mid-palate, drying up the creamy malt complexities with some oak and bourbony caramel.  At this point, the Expedition stout makes its presence clearly known, bringing forth flavors of deeply roasted coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, and a finish of sprucy hops.  This provides the perfect finish to an exquisite treat.  Theres no question this is a fantastic beer, but its also worth noting the Expedition stout still held its own and edged this one out in this side-by-side tasting.  Thanks for sharing, Chris!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
1010,"2007-07-23",4.2,"Sample at Indiana Microbrewers Festival - Aroma is big time bourbon with some roasted chocolate malt and molasses sneaking in.  Pours black with a small brown head.  Flavor is intense but not overwhelming.  Dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, molasses and brown sugar.  Palate is oh so smooth and creamy hiding the alcohol very well.  A fantastic brew I had multiple times during the day and it seemed to get better each time.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","MI2CA"
1010,"2007-07-22",4.7,"Draft.  Not as thick as the Dark Lord.  But almost on the same level except way, way different.  More upfront flavor.  Strong alchohol edge lost points in my book, although my friends enjoyed this more than Dark Lord.  I thought regular expedition stout was a little more ""finished.""  This was one of the two best beers at the Indiana brewers guild festival.","Pennsylvania, USA","gmcase"
1010,"2007-07-21",4.6,"2nd beer I tried at Indy Brewers Guild Fest.   (palate definitely not burnt out)  Impenetrable darkness with a dense enough tan head to make this look not just menacing, but like theres some real substance to this beer.  Big bourbon nose over rich chocolate to molasses.  Oaky, but definitely under control.  Balanced, though exceedingly sweet.  I cannot smell the alcohol.  Velvety smooth in the mouth, I think this is truly the perfect mouthfeel, I cant imagine better.  Sublte carbonation, delightful mouth warming.  Sweet creamy bourbony chocolatey roasty wonderfulness.  Really lovely.  Sweet enough to balance its big alcohol and bourbony oak.  Vanilla lingers long after the roasty finish.  This is a cannot miss, drive 2 two hours for a detour out of the way without question sort of beer.  I must find this again!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
1010,"2007-07-19",4.4,"Huge thanks to egajdzis for this...
Appears a near black with dark brown edges. The small tan cap fades into a little film and mild collar. Spotty streaks of lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of butter cream, lactose, bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, cocoa, dark chocolate...pretty intense, complex, and enticing.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a ""smores"" like taste (I see egajdzis took author rights for my original thoughts), along with creamy caramel standing out.
Mouthfeel is sweet up front, smooth, full of bourbon and cocoa. Delicious stuff. This is what I had hoped KBS was going to be.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
1010,"2007-07-18",4.7,"Hand bottle from Growler. Big thanks to egajdis for sharing this hand bottle, this was truly a treat. Pours a deep, deep black body with thin head. Aroma was very complex - butter (not in a diactyl way, but in a bourbon/whisky way!), vanilla, bourbon, vinous. The aroma honestly changed everytime I took a sniff, well deserving of its ""10"" rating. Flavor is complex as well - caramel, vanilla, butter, very sweet. A few sips I noticed had an peanutbutter like taste. Being a bourbon barrel beer this is pretty smooth and I was surprised to find that the sweetness of the Double Cream was dominating the Expedition. This is one truly delicious beer and I NEED to have a bottle (or grolwer) all to myself at some point in time to truly appreciate this beer.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","jason"

1010,"2007-06-24",4.2,"Excellent beer.  Pours a very dark brown near black.  Viscous, moderate head that quickly dissipates.  Flavor is dominated by the Bells Expedition, soften slightly by Double Cream.  Im not picking up as much barrel as I frequently do with many barrel-aged products.  Flavor is somewhat of molasses, currants, and figs.  Slightly tart(almost acidic) finish.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
1010,"2007-06-24",4.5,"6/23/07.  Poured out of 64 oz. growler, obtained in a trade with mcallister on RateBeer 6/22/07.  Somewhat oily dark brown-black appearance with slightly crumbly, ""malt ball"" uneven, dark tan-brown head.  Carbonation and lacing could be better, but its a growler pour and the beer itself cant be held to the fire too much over that, especially where everything else seems perfect.  Huge aroma of French Vanilla saltwater taffy, chewy fudge brownie, hints of molasses and a light burnt treacle, with fuzzy prickling hops and a warming bourbon-oak tingle, beautiful and lovely.  Decadent and filling malts, and Ive only just smelled it!  Flavor is terrifically dense with chocolate and vanilla taffy, some caramel toffee, rich chocolate malt, and chewy bourbon, as well as a soothing, gentle lactose sweetness.  A bite of anise seed husks emerges as it warms.  Incredibly full-bodied and viscous, though not with a gritty, chunky viscosity like some other huge beasts (Dark Lord, Southern Tier Oat)-- this is thick and silky, almost like a syrup, but paradoxically not cloyingly sweet like one might expect.  The finish remains incredibly long with a focus on burnt char, firming up and thinning out the decadent chocolate-marshmallow syrupy malt richness.  Theres also a black roastiness married to that thin woody tingle, but a slight sort of medicinal retronasal alcohol burn creeps a bit too much in the back end.  The bourbon burn is coupled with an oaky, almost tannic dryness-- contributing an almost wine-like character even, like the most luscious cabernet you can imagine.  Theres a toasted nutshell quality WAY deep in the finish, but its undoubtedly there, and a sign of one of the wonders of this and many other masterful beers--  new eccentricities continue to unfold with each new sip, and sometimes even long after your last taste.  I cant shake the taste of this beer even five minutes after my last sip, and thankfully the good outlasts the bad.  If the carbonation were a little more prominent, it might enhance the texture some, but I dont know if it could have taken down that alcohol burn; still a stunning marriage of malt and wood, more densely layered with big stout and bourbon nuances than most others in this class.  More like Double Cream than Expedition, but the Expo undoubtedly contributes a lot of that heft that can stand up so well to the bourbon flavors.   Still, this isnt quite as good as the best bottles of Expedition that Ive had.  Id love to try a fresher sample to see if it could improve any, but this will have to do, and I wont apologize for how well its done.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
1010,"2007-06-23",4.8,"First off, let me say my thanks to Larry Bell for making this gem, and thanks to The Party Town for making this available for growler fills.
That being said, wow, what a treat!  Im a huge expedition fan, so this beer is what Im all about.  Pours a dark brown with a slight head that recedes quickly after pouring.  This is possibly one of the best noses Ive ever had come from a beer.  I spent quite a bit of time sniffing this one.  Smell is velvety bourbon, with notes of chocolate and espresso coffee.  The taste is incredible.  Think bourbon barrel aged Expedition with a very creamy and silky finish due to the Double Cream.  This is the perfect combination, everything is working incredbily together.  If bottled this would rival and give Kentucky Breakfast a run for its money.  Very happy that I had the chance to enjoy this, but very sad as well, because the chances of coming across this rare gem again is small.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"
1010,"2007-06-22",4.3,"So I was leaving for work yesterday when I got a box from FedEx.  I looked at the label, saw it was from Craig, but I was late so I had to leave.  Upon getting home I opened it, to see what was inside, and among other beers, this was in there!  I saw Craig rated this the other day, but I did not think anything else about it.  It was even hand bottled in my 7oz corona bottle.   The beer pours out pretty much black in color without much of a head.  Smell is full of coffee and chocolate and sweet sugars.  Hints of bourbon are in the nose as well, but not enough to be unpleasant.  Taste is smooth and creamy, much like the double cream ale, but the finish is thick, like expedition.   There are bourbon notes in the flavor but it is more of a subtle oaken vanilla flavor that is pleasing as opposed to drinking a glass of Jim.  Completely unsolicited, this made this beer even better.  Went well with a cigar.  Thanks for this beer Craig, I guess I dont hate you afterall.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
1010,"2007-06-22",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2007 Words can not express my gratitude to Shigadeyo for sending me a hand bottle of this rare beer. Pours a viscous dark brown/  oil black with a dissipating brown head. Very complex aroma. On the initial pour, the aroma is vineous and roasty, but as it warms notes of molasses, oak, leather, and coffee emerge. Texture is creamy with soft carbonation. Initial flavor of vanilla and sweet dark chocolate that transitions to a middle that has flavors of dry oak and mild roast bitter coffee. Soft spicy  hop bitterness comes out on the finish, along with notes of dry red wine and some earthy graininess in the texture. The alcohol is there, but has melded into the beer quite nicely. I know this is a blend, but if you take out the barrel traits, this is like a Double Cream Stout on the front, and an Expedition Stout on the finish. Unlike some critics on this site, I think barrel aging is a great trend because it gives us the opportunity to see what other complexities that it can contribute to a beer. I am so appreciative of the opportunity to try this. Thanks Craig, I will try to refrain from calling you names for at least a day.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
1010,"2007-06-21",4.4,"Growler sample from shigadeyo. Poured a black color with a moderate creamy brown head that diminished slowly and produced sticky legs and fair lacing.

This is a standout beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1010,"2007-06-20",4.7,"6/19/2007:  Bells Bourbon Barrel Double Cream/Expedition Stout pours out in a ribbon of milk chocolate brown.  It seems a bit thin, but as always, looks can be deceiving.  In the glass it has a deep, dark mahogany brown color and is nearly opaque.  However, it is clean and clear when held up to intense light and tipped slightly.  There is also a nice, foamy brown head that doenst last too long, but does leave a thin lasting crown.  The aroma and especially the flavor of this beer are very intense and insanely comlex.  I will do my best to describe them both, but like most high quality beers, sometimes words do not really adequately represent how awesome it is...  The aroma is a lustrous composition of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted and caramelized malts, vanilla, docile bourbon, alcohol-soaked oak, char, and sweet anise.  Very complex, hypnotic, and alluring!  The flavor is very much like the aroma, but even more sophisticated.  Again, I will do my best on describing what I can...  The first pass is sweet and reveals caramelized malts, vanilla, chocolate, and char.  There is some sort of faint nutty quality as well that tastes like walnut or suble black walnut.  Each sample reveals additional flavors and complexities:  One sip has rich, layered chocolate, and roasted malts,  The next is creamy vanilla, soft and mellow oak, mellow bourbon.  After that comes tobacco, sweet licorise, molasses, and char.  It really is very deep and truly complex, yet quite fluent and refined.  Here is my last attempt as describing the flavor which might be the closest:  Creamy and sweet, semi-sweet chocolate, bourbon soaked wood, deep char, sweet licorice, molasses, a hint of tobacco, and some gentle warming alcohol.  There is also a blast of smooth bourbon just before the finish that gives way to more wonderful semi-sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, sweet char and subtle licorice.  The alcohol is so well blended into the flavor; it is truly complimentary to everything else going on in this beer.  I also provides a pleasant warming sensation as well without being out of control or burning.  Amazingly, all of there intricate flavors are expertly melded together in a beer that isnt overly thick like sludge or syrupy.  The body of the beer is medium to medium-full body.  The carbonation is very fine which helps produce an extremely smooth and silky texture.  It is milky on the palate and sticky on the lips!

Overall, Bells Bourbon Barrel Double Cream/Expedition Stout is very intense, yet so easy to drink.  Its hard to hold back and just not drink the entire glass quickly, but its so awesome that it should be enjoyed slowly so that each drink can be savored and pondered.  This is truly an excellent beer and a phenomenal blend of two great beers.  Characteristics of both beers are present, but they are so beautifully melded together that this blended, barrel-aged beer is absolutely better than either one is by itself.  True synergy.  Not only that, it is also a fine example of how barrel-aging should be done.
Draught (growler fill) from Party Town in Florence, Kentucky.  This beer was well worth the drive and wait in line!  I should have made my wife go so that she could have bought a second growler for me (it was one fill per person since it was only a 1/4 barrel keg), but that really wouldnt have been fair to everybody else there.  After all, a beer this good should be shared with friends (although deep down I really wish that I could horde it all for myself!).  I really hope that more of this excellent beer is made available in there area...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
1010,"2007-06-17",4.7,"Bought at Party Town in Florence Kentucky. Thanks Party Town!!!

A very nice looking beer and not sure why Im not givinig it a 5 out of 5. Black in color with a small tan head that fades quickly. Very still and mysterious. 

Quite possibly the best nose Ive witnessed on a beer. Charred bourbony oak aromas with toasty vanilla tones. Roasted burnt chocolate malts, mollasses, and raisin with a large lactose aroma on the finish. Black fruits of currant, black cherry, and hints of pepper. Somewhat sweet and very enticing.

Again hard not to give a perfect score for taste. Just the slightest imperfection in the mid palate keeps this from coming to fruition. This beer is hugely complex with intense roasted chocolate malts. Marshmallow flavors with a thick creamy lactose induced mouthfeel and mid palate. Charred flavors with a tingly carbonation with creamy, silky smooth textures. Vanilla and caramel meld well with the layered dark fruit flavors. Hints of licorice in the flavor and sweet toasted oak. Bourbon flavors show through and really integrate nicely with the roasty flavors. Alcohol shows through somewhat but isnt overwhelming.

1010,"2007-04-08",4.3,"Sampled (in abundance) from a snifter at a Bells event held at the Clarkston Union. This beer is a blend of Double Cream Stout and Expedition Stout that is aged in bourbon barrels. Two of my favorite beers, blended, aged in bourbon. Did I read that right? Awesome. And, the blend worked. The bourbon notes enhanced rather than masked the big, bold flavors of the Expedition Stout, namely, the roasted, charred malts, dusty raisins and prunes, and licorice. The finish was soft and creamy with the lactic sweetness characteristic of the Double Cream Stout. The big flavors were mellowed by the incredibly soft, pillowy mouthfeel. A most successful marriage of two already outstanding beers. I hope I see this one again.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
