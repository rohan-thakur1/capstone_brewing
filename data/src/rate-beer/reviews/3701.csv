3701,"2016-08-19",3.6,"This was poured into a becher pint glass.
The appearance was a semi-transparent ruddy amber color with some carbonation seen rising to fill a one finger white foamy head that dissipated nicely. Messy lacing clings to the glass.
The aroma starts off with sweet and bitter citrus rind and pulp over top of deep rich sweet caramel and toffee malts.
The flavor takes in all of the previously mentioned aromas with a dry sweet semi-grainy aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a nice sessionable trait about it. Carbonation rides under allowing a ton of malts to stick to my tongue decently, not cloying, but yes, decent.
Overall, Id say this was a pretty good Irish red ale that I could have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
3701,"2014-02-07",3.6,"Draft at pro pig, Pours murky red copper with smaller white head. Awesome lace. Taste is very malty and a touch soapy until the finish which showcases the bitter ashy hops you see in ambers. Lighter bodied. Not my thing. A little grainy and lacking juiciness.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3701,"2014-02-06",3.7,"Roasted malty aroma and flavor. Some bitter hops and a bitter finish, but mostly roasted malt. Full flavored.

3701,"2013-12-08",3.9,"22oz bottle pours semi-clear reddish brown with big head. Nose is fruity, nutty, subtle pine, juicy. Taste is juicy earthy fruit with nice notes of roasty almonds, nuts, malt and subtle piney lemon. Finish is juicy, nutty malt, bitter, roasty, fruit. One of the better red ales.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"

3701,"2013-11-12",3.6,"22 oz. bottle. Snifter shows me a crimson color with brown highlights, soapy white head. Aroma is all earthy pine hops. Flavor start with caramel and malts that give it a nutty flavor. The hops in the finish start with a touch of citrus that then leads into the piney, earthy resinous bite. Carbonation gives a lively tingle on the tongue. Medium in body with a slightly drying texture. Overall it not going to be the best red ale you ever had but it is real easy to drink and I could down a good amount of this. Still pretty good all things considered.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3701,"2013-11-11",4.0,"Tap at Pro Pig. Pours amber with a big beige head that lingers. Scent is floral, pineapple hop. Caramel malt backbone, a bit of nuttiness, nice citrus hop finish.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
3701,"2013-10-25",3.6,"I poured a 22oz bottle into a goblet. There was no freshness date. It cost $7 ($0.32 per ounce).

Appearance: Seemingly opaque purple, but actually dark red. No visible carbonation. Pours to a fairly big, off-white, frothy head which laces and retains well.

Smell: Mostly piney hops and resin, though not extremely aromatic per se.

Taste: The red ale isnt a style thats really been defined. It tend to get lumped in with amber ales or confused with Irish Reds, but its not really either. Steves Back Yard Red Ale is a good example since you wouldnt mistake it for either of these styles. Its a fine beer thats a bit simple, but makes it work towards its advantage.

The main flavor here is that found in the nose: resiny, piney hops. Not quite as aggressively bitter as an IPA, since it does have a noticeably malty backbone to it. I dont really get any distinct malt character, though. Perhaps its akin to a Scottish or similar style but without any smoke, yet its not particularly sweet either. The piney hops are pleasant, imparting a strong, flavorful bitterness that doesnt overwhelm. Balancing out this palette would probably make for an excellent beer, though Im not complaining about what I have.

Drinkability: While Steves Back Yard Red Ale has a lot of hoppy flavor, I was surprised by how smooth the mouthfeel was. It has a texture thats somewhere between that of water and cream (milk?). Its easy to drink in larger gulps, but its not refreshing. At 5.5% ABV its pretty efficient Id say, and ideal to pair with dinner.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
3701,"2013-10-15",3.5,"Mostly clear deep chestnut color with a little creaminess on top that shrinks to a patchy ring. Moderately hoppy nose...sort of dark and piney with a bit of tea, nuts, and malt to balance. Nice, balanced hoppy flavor: zesty, juicy citrus, increasing pine needle bitterness, some caramel malt mixes well with the ""darker"" hop character. Medium bodied and solidly bitter. I like this more and more as I drink it...","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

3701,"2012-09-17",3.6,"22 oz bottle.  Purple brown, clear at the edges with a beige skin.  Nose is orange, caramel and grass.  Brisk medium body, finishing dry with a dull tingle.

3701,"2012-05-02",3.0,"In short: A low intensity juicy fruity (berries and apples mainly) ruby ale.  Bland.
How: Tap at Three Penny Taproom, Montpelier, VT
The look: Cloudy ruby-bronze body topped by a very small off0-white head
In long: Nose is mostly fruity with berries, bananas, tropical fruits, citrus fruits.  The aroma is rather low in intensity (especially for a Lawsons) and most of the fruitiness is not hop-related.  Just a mix-bag of yeasty/malty fruity aromas with some citrusy hops here and there.  Taste is pretty much the same except with a bit more focus on red fruits and red apples skin  and also a sensation of crushed fruit seeds.  Some juicy hops with a timid bitterness.  There was nothing offensive in this beer, but it was just very bland and lacked that lacked the attitude and freshness sensation that usually characterises Lawsons beers.  Lawsons Finest is one of my fetish brewery, so obviously the Back Yard Red was a big disappointment.  One of the rare faux-pas in Lawsons catalog, oh well, you cant win them all, unless youre my wife arguing with me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3701,"2012-04-11",3.6,"bottle courtesy of Reynolds314, thanks a ton! pours a very dark and somewhat opaque muddy red color with a nice head, leaves nice lacing. really nice spicy and caramel candy aroma, really digging it. the flavor doesnt hold as well, and then in the finish there is a weird drying soapy thing, but not in a super hoopy good kinda way. overall a decent drinker when fresh. irish ale is a pretty hard stytle in general, its a little different thanan american red ale, so i appreciate this beer.","Notown, California, USA","wavers1"
3701,"2012-03-09",3.2,"Bottle from hbmason...thanks Tim! - Pours ruby red-brown with a big foamy light tan head. Nose is nice...a good mix of grassy and herbal hops--a bit spicy. Dry bready nose, but the malt isnt terribly bold. Taste falls a bit flat. Dry, mineral notes cover up some watery malt, and a sharp grassy note cuts a bit too hard. Carbonation is a little strong, and the whole thing is a bit watery. Just a little too dry and watery for me.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
3701,"2012-03-05",3.5,"Bottle, thanks to emileer, 03/05/2012.  Deep ruby amber pour, nearly brown, healthy head recedes to foamy surface slick.  They know how to make nice looking beers for sure.  Largely malty nose, earthy with light roast,caramel and subtle fruitiness, touch of citrus hops struggles to make itself known.  Taste more light roast malts, slightly nutty, citrus sweetness and bitterness.  Palate is light, but smooth and full with carbonation.  Easy drinking ale, could knock back a few of these.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
3701,"2012-02-24",3.2,"Bottle/22oz - Pours a very dark ruby reddish brown in color with a medium foamy light tan head.  Aroma is of roasty malts with some nuttiness as well and just a hint of earthy hops.  Flavor is also quite roasty with biscuit/nuts and a mild amount of hops... including the bitterness, which lingers to the end.  Good, but could have been hoppier for a ""Red""... Liked it!","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"

3701,"2012-02-18",4.6,"Had this at Three Penny Taproom. Paid $6 for a Pint on draft.


A - Half Finger head that was creamy. The brew itself was a red to brown deep stout looking beer but lots of red if you put up a light to it.

S - Some pine, delicious sweet malts, apples and bananas

T - Pecans, nuts and a lot of earthiness. The hops are really present but not in your face. The red lager certainly counteracts there. Nutmeg and vanilla were present with a hint of maple

M - Huge mouth feel. Lots of bubbles, about 90% carbonation on a swish. Lots of linger thats just oh so pleasant

O - Fantastic beer thats really only available in a small part of Vermont. If you can find it bottled, pick it up.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

3701,"2012-02-04",2.8,"Big thanks to Steve for sending this bottle my way. Served in a SAVOR wine glass.

Pours a dark reddish-copper color with a thin off-white head and a bit of lacing. The nose carries some amber and brown malt. Overall, quite malty for an amber. Some piney and resinous hops come along, plus a bit of citrus. Flavor loses those hops, and is a bit earthy and malty all at once. Not too much sweetness; more generic malt flavor. Medium body with moderate bitterness through the finish. A bit disappointing for a Lawsons brew.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
