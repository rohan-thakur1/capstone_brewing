Currants, sugar, liquid chocolate, now milk choco, faint licorice, crusts. The dark milky chocolate thickens up as it sits - much like me.

1802,"2017-04-15",5.0,"Tout comme la ÖÖ originale, versée noire débène avec une mousse brune fine. On est bien en présence dune Baltic Porter avec un vent force 10.5. Le nez est une belle promesse et tient à une combinaison de deux éléments : les malts tout dabord, avec cette charge de café et de cacao impressionnante ainsi que les notes de miel de châtaigne, de sirop dérable, de sucre candi, de caramel, de gelée de coin et de mélasse, et le fruit, avec lajout de cassis qui nous délivre de beaux arômes de pruneau, de fraise des bois, de cerise bigarreau, de sureau, de raisin sec, de banane séchée, de datte et de figue sèches, dabricot, de mûre... On sent la filiation avec sa grande sur à travers une levure présente et un côté légèrement terreux qui hume bon la prairie après la pluie. En bouche, les promesses sont tenues. Alcool de très haute volée, carbonatation faible comme attendue, texture riche et ronde avec une densité monstrueuse et amertume superbe, sèche et capiteuse à la fois. Deuxième gorgée qui sarticule sur les flaveurs de malts avec le fruit en arrière bouche. Équilibre subtil sur une base très puissante, la main de fer dans le gant de velours. Les arômes en arrière-nez avec le liquide en bouche sont une merveille, avec une montée progressive et puissante qui laisse ensuite sexprimer les levures, terreuses et presque fumées comme je le disais précédemment mais avec une belle ligne et cette amertume sèche, tourbée, très longue et légèrement astringente. Le cassis est extrêmement discret au démarrage et il faut boire quelques lampée et faire tourner le liquide sur la langue pour en ressentir la pleine mesure. Cest subtil et très bien joué. Bien entendu, on a les flaveurs de cacao amer et de café en permanence qui jouent des coudes pour savoir lequel des deux prend le dessus. Le final est agréable, long, planant. Il laisse en bouche les traces du passage dAttila, avec une espèce de mâche qui ensuquerait (voir anesthésierait) presque la cavité buccale. Reste aussi du fruit en arrière-bouche malgré un déluge de sensations maltées, cest vraiment un délice. Reste quon ne trouve pas de notes houblonnées hormis lamertume, mais ce nest absolument pas le propos de ce type de produit. Cest équilibré, bien construit, complexe, gourmand. En soxygénant comme un grand vin, cette bière exhale de plus en plus les notes de fruits. Cest vraiment superbe... Au final, cette ÖÖ Cassis est la version Nec Plus Ultra du breuvage original. Comme quoi il ne lui fallait pas forcément grand chose dautre en plus. Juste la cerise (ou le cassis) sur le gâteau. Bouteille 33cl, Boissons du Monde, Saint-Egrève.","Grenoble, FRANCE","Zarrach76"

1802,"2016-10-30",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2016 Tap (OlutExpo2016) (7:4:6+:3:13+=3.3++)
Chris didnt want me to drink this. ""Dont serve that man beer"" he said. Unfortunately, Samu ignored him! Berry-dominant aroma, quite sharp and harsh blackcurrant, but in combination with the richness of the roast, it somehow works, and makes you want to dive in. Dark, small tan head. Taste delivers exactly what was promised, and I kinda feel like I should have paid more attention to the harshness of the berries there. Fortunately theres a sweetness that helps knock the top off the sharp edges of the berries. Quite berry dominated, and not necessarily in a way I go mad over.
Rerate: Tap (Koht, Tallinn) - marduks glass
More like cherry in this one, nice, less harsh than the purer blackcurrant of the first sample. Covers alc well. Easily 3.8.
Rerate: Tap (Koht, Tallinn) - marts glass
One hour later, same keg, and its a different beer. Harsher. Still decent, but back to the 3.3-3.4 zone. (Anna adds: this one is less of an easy drinker and is dominated by spices, maybe from near the bottom of the keg, and the once cherry-like fruitiness isnt obvious) 
(Aside, the ""Did I do a bad rating?"" from the original template rating is a reference to the British comedy ""Psychoville"".)
Rerate: Tap (Koht, Tallinn) (7:4:7:4:14)
Lots of banana skins and strings in the aroma. Black, tiny tan head. Sweetish palate, but not too sticky because it has a nice carbonation level. Taste is pleasantly roasty, still has a banana string aspect. Cassis working pretty well here. Why is there banana here? Who cares - this is moreish!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
1802,"2016-10-29",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2016 Tap at Koht. Dark brown with tan head that dissipated quite fast.

Deep dark chocolate and some pleasant sourish blackcurrants in flavour. A bit of licorice too. Thick full mouthfeel, fine but somewhat zingy carbonation. Alcohol well hidden except for a little pleasant warmth coating the palate. Excellent stuff.

Edit: Bottle; batch 314; BB 03.10.2017. Looks the same. Aroma pretty much the same, less as cocoay, more black currants and chocolate cake, really nice mix of sweet chocolate and sour berries.
