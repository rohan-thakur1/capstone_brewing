I am not getting any of the hop bitterness from the description, but I am not missing it. As it warms it gets more chocolatey. The palate should be stronger.

71,"2014-05-04",4.2,"Bottle says ""2013."" Acquired in trade.
The appearance had a dark black almost brown color with no head in the snifter but a two fingered white head in the pint glass, am I arguing - no way, its all good (fit happy looking emoticon right here, right now). The lacing is a bit to be desired in snifter, but the pint glass, wow - nice clinging effect gracing ever so nicely.
The smell had pumpkin up front graced with a nice allspice and ginger sort of background (sweet yet a spicy of sorts) and a decent roasty coffee yet almost leading to a fairly good chocolate of sorts in the aroma.
The taste was sweet but a pumpkin-ness of sorts spiciness flavoring. The aftertaste is a bit misleading as theres a super amount of Pumpkin coming through helping to overtake the stout-like features of this brew. There is a dry spicy finish.
On the palate, it sits about a medium on the body and leaves a decent coating of pumpkin sweetness clinging to the mouth and tongue. Carbonation is good for the style of a Double Stout and is still good to me.
Overall, this has been a long time whale that I was glad to have finally acquired.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
71,"2014-05-01",4.5,"First off, I am not a pro. I will speak to my senses and memories and feelings. My first review, gimme a present.


WHIFFLES: Remember when you would walk out of High School on a October day and youre all like THIS WEATHER IS KICKASS & IMMA GET TO WEAR A MASK & EAT LOTSA SUGAR EVEN THOUGH IM OLDER BUT I DONT GIVE A DAMN for the weekend? Yeah, its kinda like that but with the anticipation of but wait theres more! beyond. This smells like the lingering backyard kiss from a not-blood related hottie cousin who just ate a cinnamon cream leftover thingy that you passed on at the Thanksgiving table when you two were out back past the barn where no one could see. Not that I have ever done that or anything. 

LOOKSY: This babe is deep and dark and has an inviting dirty secret or two when you look at her in a Delirium Tremens snifter. The legs on the glass tease me like a 1981 Bond movie poster. Theres less head here than in a Vatican womens bathroom. Theres an alluring color mixed up in there that I want to make up a word for, which I dont have, so for now I will call itAuburown.

TASTEY TASTE: In 15 seconds me oral cavity is getting THIS IS HALLOWEENTHIS IS HALLOWEEN PUMPKINS SCREAM IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. Ichabod Crane was a wus. I am Jacks incessant need for continuous imbibement. I bought a case of this from HEB shortly after drinking this, nearly thwarted by the manager. I told him I would fight him for it, he relented. 

MOUFFEEL: Peely. Like I shoved my face inside a freshly carved Jack O Lantern with a mouthful of organic marshmellows. Willfully. Its as if a pimp designed the décor of the insides of my mouth. Velvet, yall.

TRUTH: Linus Van Pelt wasnt screwing around when he told Charles Brown about the greatness of this smacky good squash. This isnt some cheerleader with orange pom poms jumping up and down trying to tell you Pumpkin flavored brew can be good. This is an orange pot-bellied lifecoach, telling you you damn well better come straight and clean or dont get on his field. The Saint of Arnolds got it done.","Houston, Texas, USA","Cloaker"

I popped them and grabbed my bottle capper and put new caps on them. I will be writing the brewery about this. Would have gotten a higher rating but the a idiot is definitely from some oxidation.

71,"2013-10-16",3.9,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Specs - Galleria, 10/16/13, as Saint Arnold 2013 Pumpkinator Imperial Pumpkin Stout


Aroma: The nose is full of pumpkin spice, cinnamon, with some roasted malts, and vanilla

Appearance: It pours an opaque brown-black color with a small brown head and drippy lace

Flavor: The taste is much the same, lots of seasonal spice to go along with roasted and sweet malts

Palate: The body is medium-full, it has a very smooth, creamy feel, and a soft carbonation

Overall Impression: 
First off, I quite like the name. Secondly, this is a pretty nice beer. Theres quite a bit of pumpkin spice, but theres enough other stuff going on to balance it out. I can see why this is so well regarded, it is a pretty quality brew.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

The spices were obvious as soon as the top came off. Nose was nutmeg cinnamon (?) and sweet brown sugar. Pour was a quickly dissipating, coarse head with a slightly reddish cast and the bottle was in the mid-50s deg F. when it came from the cellar. Im not sure how old this is, but it has been in my cellar for probably a year.

mouth feel was a little rough and there is some alcohol heat, but damned if the mellow sweetness and spicy flavors didnt hit the spot tonight. Flavors beyond the pie-spice were a clear pumpkin/squash note and the finish was all about pumpkin pie.

Everything from the aroma finds its way to my palate, courtesy of a hefty body (with a surprising amount of carb). Spices all play off each other and the chocolate/cinnamon base marvelously.

Bottle:  The aroma consists of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, and faint chocolate.  It pours a dark brown with no transparency and a small beige head that leaves behind minimal lacing.  The flavor starts with a good dose of chocolate.  The finish has some caramel along with moderate ginger, cinammon, nutmeg, and clove.

A - Pitch black body. Zero light shines through. A decent frothy khaki head formed and receded to some solid edging. Lacing and retention is pretty weak.

S - Pumpkin pie spice followed by some dark roasty, chocolaty malts. The spice smells really natural, cinnamon, cloves, all spice, nutmeg, etc. I get the slightest hint of squash. This smells fantastic!

T - Not as impressive as the nose. Roasted bitter pumpkin followed by the full spice cabinet and some biscuity malts. The nutmeg is very strong on this one. There is a lot of sweetness which is balanced out by the spice and bitterness. The mouth feel is medium bodied, but for an imperial stout I was hoping for a bit more body.

Another Saint Arnold Divine Reserve release and another winner. I wish I could try them all but there are simply too many other beers to chase to have time. However if I were more local to Texas they would be on the top of my list every time a new release came out. Heres to hoping another one makes its way to me at some point.

Aroma and appearance - The inky black body swirls like a deep porter. A slow growing head collapses and clings to itself like the foam that fills holes in a wall. The color of gritty sand it is a slight contrast to the base. The nose smells like warm pumpkin pie fresh from the oven with a dollop of whipped cream and chocolate ice cream. The main spices are nutmeg and cinnamon giving this a sweet fall feel.

Flavor and palate - The warmth fills the mouth indicating this is not a mellow beer. A blend of espresso, nutmeg, and fresh pumpkin rinse any other flavors away in a sea of texture. The finish tastes like a heavy truffle and lingers for a long time. Plum with an edge of smoke add more depth. This is a nice beer that has held up well but probably does not great cellaring potential. Still if you keep it safe it should last until at least August.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a pretty solid black color with a stingy tan head that dissipates almost immediately. Smells of pumpkin pie, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc a slight bit of roasted coffee and chocolate when she warms up a bit. Warming alcohol is present in the nose but adds a layer imho. Taste is roasty with those pie spices coming through quickly. I take a sip and feel the roast, then I feel the spices come to the forefront of my palette and for a quick second I think its a spicy hop flavor coming at me but the pie slices those thoughts. A bit of warming alcohol, long lingering roast and cocoa on the finish. Creamy bordering on syrupy in the mouth, light carbonation, thick body. I really enjoyed this one. I think the pie plays really well with the dark roasty flavors.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

71,"2011-04-15",2.9,"Shared by someone at the Splinter Black release. Poured into my Savor snifter.

Pours near black with a thin tan head and not too much of any lacing. The nose is pretty heavy on the spicing with a good amount of cinnamon and allspice coming through as well as some star abuse. Light chocolate and roast are there as well.

The flavor is quite heavy on the spicing and a bit overpowering in that manner. Pinch of licorice along with roast and mild chocolate coming through. Mouthfeel is a bit zippy with extra carbonation, perhaps just enhanced via the spices. Drinks decent enough. I like the concept but the spices were overdone and not balanced with one another.

3.0 A: Black color. About a quarter finger of frothy light tan head. Poor retention and no lacing.

5.0 S: Wow, this is completely unexpected. This is full of spices and smells as if Halloween got in a head-on collision with Christmas. Allspice, nutmeg, cardamon, and cinnamon meets gingerbread, black licorice, molasses, and candied plums. The stout characteristics never make it past the spiciness, but thats okay considering how awesomely spicy the aromas is.

4.5 T: The stout comes through a bit stronger in the taste, but not much more so. Some roastiness, chocolate, and molasses. The show, once again, are the spices. All the pumpkin spices are in full force with nutmeg and cinnamon at the forefront. The Christmas aspects are equally strong, with ginerbread and sugar plums leading this army. Booze is minimal.

4.0 M: Medium body. Carbonation is a bit low, but it seems to work well. Reasonably creamy and super smooth. The booziness I was expecting really isnt there much at all.

5.0 D: Overall just a really great beer. The spices are strong, but done well and in good combination. The nose is amazing, the taste is nearly as good, and the beer is unique.

Big pumpkin aroma- notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, vegetal squash, vanilla, and caramel malts. The flavor finds those spices mixed with a lot of earthy and vegetal notes as well as root beer. The palate is a bit harsh and over-carbonated and washes out some of the pumpkin characteristics, which certainly dominate any stout characteristics in this. Still, a pretty cool pumpkin beer overall. Re-Rate: Got another bottle of this from Brian, this time the 2011 Pumpkinator- thanks, Brian!

Heavier-bodied with a syrupy feel and low carbonation on the palate.. very dry on the back-end with tacky spices on the finish.. alcohol for the most part just beefed it up, only overtly peeking out at a couple points.

Still have plenty of spices with not too much sweetness--the roast and alcohol do a very nice job balancing.

71,"2010-03-19",3.5,"Big thanks to Wasatch for this one.

Pours almost completely opaque black with only a bit of mahogany coming through the edges.  Theres a big creamy tan head that leaves a solid cap but little lacing.

The aroma is dominated by the pumpkin spices, especially the caraway.  There is also nutmeg, chocolate malts and pumpkin, but that takes a bit of a back seat to the spices.

The taste ramps the spices up to a different level, as the initial sip is a flood of caraway and nutmeg.  The underlying chocolate malts are present but they are definitely in the background, along with the pumpkin.  The finish is dry and very spicy with an alcohol burn that lingers after each sip.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied for an impy stout and very creamy, though the most prevalent characteristics are the spices and alcohol.

This is a good impy stout (or a very good spiced beer) that is unabashedly spicy.  Ive tasted by few beers that had such a dominant spiciness, with the caraway bringing the heat on the palate.  Interesting and tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

S: The aroma has a lot of traditional pumpkin beer qualities to it. The pumpkin lends a nice aroma, however, the nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, etc. are perhaps over done. There is also a quite strong alcohol presence.

T: There was simply too heavy of a hand in terms of the spices. They overwhelm the beer and take away from usually powerful flavors such as the roasted malt and chocolate. Again, the alcohol is just too strong.

M: As you would expect for such a big beer, the body is quite full. The carbonation is also fairly low, providing a smooth mouthfeel.

D: The beer is just way over spiced and too hot. I would like to see how this might age, as the spices and alcohol might die down, but as of now, its not a beer Id seek out again.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

The aroma is full up robust Christmas spices and rich holiday spiced pastries. I get a snoot full of cinnamon moving toward all spice, pumpernickel, ginger snap cookies and bright deep red cherry hard candy. The taste is just as robust as the nose with a barrel full of cinnamon and all spice sliding into ginger bread man cookies and pumpernickel. Theres a modest slick undercurrent of malt to molasses like sweetness. Id love to sample this with a few years on it. It is a tad too bright today. Thanks Eric.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

71,"2010-01-07",4.0,"Wow, where to start.

the beer pours dark brown/black with a tan head. There are brown highlights when held up to a light source.

Aroma is spicy nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. The spices you would expect from a pumpkin pie. Also get a little gingerbread.

Taste is very complex. I started the beer at about 50 degrees and the first two flavors were chocolate and alcohol. In addition to the chocolate flavor, you also get some bitter chocolate flavor. Very nice. As the beer warms, you start to get more spices. The flavor is not like any of the individual pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and allspice) but tastes like a combination of those spices. As the beer approaches room temperature, it starts to taste like gingerbread. There is also some roasted malt and you do get some alcohol warming.

The beer has a medium-full mouthfeel and little carbonation which goes awesome with this beer. This is a sipper, but it is extremely easy to drink. Even with some alcohol flavor, you cannot tell it is 11 percent. I have never had a beer quite like this. Great effort from Brock and the guys and gals at Saint Arnolds.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
71,"2010-01-03",4.4,"Draft at ""Under the Volcano"" in Houston. Poured almost black with minimal head. Aroma is fantastic, with subtle pumpkin, spice, and sweet vanilla.

Outstanding beer, I would definitely have another.","Houston, Texas, USA","DrZao"

Mouthfeel is crisp with some bitterness, lots of carbonation and some alcohol.  Fairly good.  Hoping it will be even better with age.

After aging for several months, this has changed quite a bit.  The pumpkin is not so prominent now.  It now has taken on a more cinnamon-ginger snap cookie taste.  Very tasty and not veggetal or alcohol-noticeable as before.","Land of Sugar, Texas, USA","MaltOMeal"

Aroma: Rich pumpkin pie or pumpkin fudge can be smelled from a good two feet away. Upon further inspection, you can pick a part some of the components of the initial smell with cinnamon, nutmeg, pureed pumpkin, vanilla.

Taste:  Pumpkin pie with hand made whip cream (not the lite canned stuff), lots of cinnamon and nutmeg spice, roasted malt, dark chocolate and a decent level of spicy hops in the finish.

Mouthfeel: Very creamy, moderately carbonated.

Overall: A wonderful dessert that should replace pumpkin pie itself.  Many pumpkin beers come off as either like air freshener or pumpkin soda. This was neither. It was rich, creamy, and smelled authentic.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

Nose is all spice, specifically pumpkin pie spices, nutmeg and cinnamon being the strongest...maybe some pumpkin underneath, but who knows for sure.  Flavors are predominately the pumpkin pie spices, with resiny hop bitterness present and warming, boozy alcohol.  Not really all that sweet but certainly more sweet than not sweet..and certainly spicy.  In fact, it really shows itself as a unique and decent dessert beer.  The spices are strong and I think the hoppiness seems to balance them out and the super boozy warming alcoholic nature makes it dessertish.

71,"2009-12-03",3.9,"Bottle. A nice solid black with a tan-brown head that might have a hint of yellow to it - maybe from the pumpkin? Who knows. The aromas great - lots of spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla) with some hints of malt and dark fruit. First impression of the flavor: boozy. Theres a strong presence of alcohol, made more noticeable by a somewhat sharp carbonation. The spices all make another strong presence, backed by some dense chocolaty malt. Maybe I was wrong about the cinnamon earlier; it doesnt really show up in the flavor. In the aftertaste and after-aroma (i.e. burp) theres a nice little roasty note that comes out. For a stout, this is somewhat dry in the finish, but it really works well, actually. Right now, as I said previously, this beers a little boozy, and the spices are strong. Another 2-3 months will do this beer very well. Ill re-rate then, and if things turn out the way I expect, Id guess itll be another 0.3-0.4 higher.

No hiding that!  Flavor is, no doubt, of a stout, but I wouldnt guess an imperial initially (although after 12oz you can tell).  Spice is in your face with a near-puckery experience of clove.  This really is a number!  Pumpkin is hidden somewhat, but wow...

Sweet malty goodness in the beginning, lays over to some very strong spices with moderate bitterness, than it strikes the back of the tongue hard with some bitterness even sour, the finish leaving an almost astringent, alcohol residue around the mouth.

At first I felt it was more subtle and hidden under the alcohol and density and rich flavors, but I felt it growing and GROWING until it was about all I could taste.

Wheat brown head. Caramel notes on the nose with the aforementioned notes as well. A sense of alcohol is also felt. Winter spice begins to emerge as the beer begins to warm. Interesting that the pumpkin 
smell shows up later in the sniff. Winter spices bring cinnamon and nutmeg to the table. Very creamy mouthfeel with an immediate tingle on the tip of the tongue. Abv is felt and warms up the tongue. Warm gingerbread taste and caramel malts. Pumpkin taste is much less perverse than I was anticipating after watching the video of how much they put in it.

Flavor is a woodsy pumpkin that fades into a bitter pile of chocolate and nutmeg spice and malted celery.  Flavor fails to linger long on the tongue despite the intense rush of flavor and high ABV, the latter hardly being noticed.  Brackish coffee grounds poke their head up between sips.  Average mouthfeel.  Not the best pumpkin Ive ever had but not the worst.  Too instense for its own good?  Maybe.
