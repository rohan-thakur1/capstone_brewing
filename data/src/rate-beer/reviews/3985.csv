Turbid/opaque ruby/dark brown beer with a slight/medium beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, dark fruit and pine; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts and hops.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Superb aroma and flavour, but could have been more roasted. This is only nitpicking though, this is amazing.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

 Podsumowanie:  

Pierwszorzędna Black IPA. 
Beavertown stanął na wysokości zadania i uwarzył bardzo stylowy, konkretny trunek. Aromat nie jest może najwyższej próby, ale smak jak najbardziej nawiązuje do stylu.
Sugestie kawy, czekolady, prażonego słonecznika, żywica, las, igiełki, ciemne owoce leśne - to tylko nieliczne akcenty wyczuwalne w piwie.

Again, just after opening the can my room is instantly filled with tropical hops. After putting my nose to the glass, the beer reveals a fresh hop presence, leading unexpectedly into a grassy, citrus dipped direction. Underneath, chocolaty, roasty malts, together with caramel convert the aromas onto a ripe orange peel, exotic fruit course.

Medium bodied beer, very smooth and easy drinking, with a refreshing hop note during the finish. Offers an unusual pairing of creaminess and pleasant dryness at the same time. 

Tastes of toasted, earthy malts, pushing even further into a Porter direction by adding a slightly sweet toffee tang to the beer, with recognizable sugar to it. This gets coated up by a silken smoothness beded on earth, from which tropical hops become introduced to the palate, changing the beers taste direction completely. The hops do put up the beers initial sweetness, but convert it into ripe fruits and add a decent dryness to it, the longer they stay on the palate, together with a strong malt backbone, remaining its creamy chocolate profile. Finishes with orange and citrus peel on toasted bakers chocolate, blending into a soft dryness.

Unusual composition, with a very pronounced, smooth maltiness and a late hop addition, reminding one, that this is still supposed to be an IPA. The hops do provide a pleasant character, resulting in a convincing teamwork with the malts.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3985,"2014-06-08",5.0,"if you ask me which is the best black IPA Ive ever had, my answer is: Black Betty. 
very dark colour and thick body with a nice white head. it looks like a russian imperial stout, but when you smell it, the aroma has all the complexity and fruitiness from its heavy hoppiness, added to (and perfectly balancing) the roasted coffe and chocolate tones. The flavours in the mouth are even more interesting and complex, with dark fruits notes, grass and pine, loads of coffe and dark chocolate, nice roasted hints and it also has a subtle and interesting smoky backtone (very subtle though). The alcohol is perfectly hidden and it just gives an impression of barrel aged undertone. The nice carbonation and the hoppy finish, makes this beer very drinkable and refreshing too. what else would you ask from a black IPA?","ITALY","Pikkio"

Thanks to Leighton for the bottle. I have been meaning to try a couple of Beavertown beers before heading home. Based on this data point they are not quite on par with the Kernel but no slouch either. I wish more breweries like this would make the trip to the US rather than more bland boring bitters that collect dust on the shelves.

Aroma / Appearance - The fluid inky base has a black edge. A vigorous pour gives it a nice tan head. Bittersweet chocolate malts, black coffee, and crisp hops create an edgy texture. It is different than what you get from an American black IPA but satisfying just the same.

Flavor / Palate - Malt, chocolate truffles, and black coffee hit the tongue in waves of rich flavor. A bittersweet hop texture transitions to a fine dry and creamy texture. It actually grows in intensity over time to have a strong bite by the end. If you make the trip to the UK and London dont overlook this brewery.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3985,"2013-07-03",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
This Black IPAs roasted malts develop raisins and chocolate, a highly pleasurable profile interwoven with flavourful coniferous hops and their bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the darkness.
-The mouthfeel is smooth and rich.
-Malts also offer caramel and hops create earth.
-This is a perfect rendition of the Black IPA, New World style.
-The flavour profile is rather complex.

3985,"2013-05-28",3.9,"Bottled (From AbM). Deep brown, close to black, colour with a mediumsized creamy beigeish brown head, that leaves some lace. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, some fruity and floral notes along with mild herbal notes as well. Flavour is ashy, chocolaty, mild toffee and some slight toasted notes along with quite mellow fruity and floral notes, but a big hoppy bitter kick in the finish.

Grapefruit, soapy, and earthy hops that are aggressive but somehow still a bit balanced, with coffee and roast aromas.  Great balance for a hop-driven Black IPA that I feel finally does what I want this style to be in terms of hops, some roast, but dry as shit and a clean hoppy finish.  Lighter to medium body with bubbly carbonation.  Fun brew!","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
