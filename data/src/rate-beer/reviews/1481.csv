1481,"2016-06-23",4.6,"Brewed Oct. 2015: When they say black ale, they aint kidding. If its not pure black its a deep, dark brown. Massive sheet of cardboard brown lace. 

The aroma is pungent black licorice, dates, plums, sour raisins. The oak is beautiful and mercifully mild; an accent. German chocolate. Dusty hazelnut. I love the complexity and the flavor of this beer. 

The flavor is a burst of alcohol, followed by a blast of burnt oak. Then there is a cascade of licorice, dark cherry, plum and dates. The alcohol coats the tongue.

The feel is creamy and milky, but dry like Ovaltine. It burns just a bit on the way down. It is a superior dark ale. The alcohol and flavor of a stout with the smooth edges of a porter.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

1481,"2015-05-30",3.1,"Bottle (750 ml). Shared by czar, thanks! Split with the Québec crew.

Appearance: Pitch black with a medium beige head, poor retention and little to no lacing. 

Aroma: Black licorice is the main feature here along ashes, raisins, roasted malts, smoke and chocolate. 

Taste: Moderately sweet with black liquorice taking most of the place again along ashes, smokey malts, caramel, roasted malts, toasted notes and alcohol.

Palate: Full body. Moderate carbonation. Warming finish. Lingering black licorice aftertaste. 

Overall: Take this rating with a grain of salt as I profoundly hate black licorice in beer. I can see why people usually like this as theres a wide variety of flavors and nothing is ""off"", but the black licorice being the main flavor here make this one completely unbalanced (it overshadow everything else) and very hard to drink for me, plus its also quite boozy. I naturally wasnt able to finish my glass. On a purely hedonist scale, this one would rank near the bottom for me, but I can recognize this isnt a bad beer per se.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Tastes the same with the addition of dried lavender, white sage/herbal hops, damp newspaper, and roasted soy beans. Abrasive, but in a fittingly good way.

A rich, sweet beer, with strong, bitter coffee notes, that linger long after the initial tasting. This black ale should be enjoyed with a contrasting edible, as the bitterness can be a little overpowering at times. While high in alcohol content, the burn only asserts itself at the end of the sip.

1481,"2014-05-17",4.1,"Reviewed from notes and perhaps the best brew Ive had by date from this company.
The night I had this, I poured this into a pint glass and a snifter.
The appearance was a pure jet black color with a one finger white foamy head in both glasses. The lacing was the same in both glasses as it was fairly clingy and thick.
The smell was a roasted barley and coffee that combines with a black licorice that ends up allowing a decent roasted chocolate coming about to balance it all out. Wow, what a nice complex smell to this.
The taste was bitter, roasty and sweet at different times and ends up allowing these super nice qualities to come back in the aftertaste. There is a finish and its somewhat dry and sweet.
On the palate, this one is not sessionable by any means. It sits heavy on the body with a decent carbonation running about my mouth and tongue.
Overall, American Black Ale, wow, this is a very well done beer for its style and for me.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

A: Pours black with a one-finger brown head that quickly dissipates into a small ring and minimal lacing left behind. 
T: Features black licorice, whiskey, chocolate, oak, vanilla, charred wood/smoke, some coffee, caramel, noticeable alcohol bite. Not bad or obtrusive at all. Minimal hops. Very rich and flavorful. 
P: A full-bodied, sticky, low carbonation black ale. 
O: A good buddy busted this out of his cellar for us to share, after I was already convinced that Uinta is a world class brewery. The aroma and flavor are huge and more than make up for the low carbonation (impacts the appearance and mouthfeel, IMO). The rye whiskey barrel comes through really well...a lot of charred oak and vanilla notes throughout. Ive said it before, and it shall be repeated, DONT SLEEP ON Uinta!","New Jersey, USA","ClassyBeagle"

1481,"2013-09-01",4.2,"Pours thick and viscuous. The color of dark or black walnut. has an inkling of lighter hues but no light passes through. it merely suggests them with its deep body. Has a thin head of creamy mocha colored foam that refreshes with each turn of the glass. Alcohol legs and shimmering wet lace. 

Nose is roasted malt, toasted grain but nothing burnt until the drink. Theres a little coffee and some semi sweet chocolate. Dark fruits are too vague to name them but they are there. It has a soft rye on the nose that is a tad spicy but mellow. It has no alcohol on the nose and thats impressive. Theres a touch of vanilla and a little toffee. This does not smell terribly sweet. In fact it smells dry and a little bitter. 

Taste is expansive and full. Malt is velvety smooth and fat. Lots of toasted roasted grain but only a touch of burnt toast at the finish. Toffee and vanilla go so well together. The rye stays soft on the palate and mellow and adds its share of bitterness to a good coffee bitterness. Chocolate is smooth, deep and rich but not too sweet. As this drinks it starts to taste like whiskey. Has a ferocious abv that remains smooth on the palate and gives a nice warmth to the back palate and in the chest as it goes down. Finishes dry and a little slick. 

The rye really adds a depth to this. The mouthfeel is as good as ti gets for a big beer like this one. The abv is done to perfection. The fact that it is not terrible sweet lets the grain adn the dark flavors shine in a bold way. Exceptionally balanced and smooth.","New York, USA","pinkie"

1481,"2013-08-14",4.0,"750ml, bottling date 4/18/11. Powerful and enticing aroma of dark, roasty malts, oak and dark chocolate, with notes of licorice, prune, black cherry, toffee, earthiness, faint vanilla, espresso and a touch of alcohol in the background. Solid ebony in color, rather thickly coats the glass, with a very fine, subsiding, light brown head. Flavor profile is rich and complex, roasty and bittersweet to start with plenty of of fine dark chocolate and charred oak, blending with a lasting dark, dried fruit character, caramel and licorice, and finishing with a light-moderate amount of bitterness, faint alcohol, old wood, earth and a certain lingering tartness. Viscous, substantial and warming on the palate with a massive body.  Feels every bit of its 13+% abv. but after this much time, the alcohol presence is really quite minimal, considering the substantial strength.  Pretty impressive, overall.

1481,"2013-06-19",4.5,"25.6 oz corked bottle, what is that, 75cl? Purchased from Cardinal in Niles with a ""bottled on 12 <unreadable> 10 date"" - whatever that is- and cellar aged almost a year. Enjoyed out on the patio as a Fathers Day treat. Pours a thick vicious black with no initial head, then a long lasting cafe au lait one leaving drippy lacing. A bit intimidating.Aroma has chocolate, rich espresso, plenty of roasted malt, some soy and some grape. The initial taste is of bakers chocolate, soy and molasses, with thick caramelly malts. Then after a bit the espresso kicks in, thick and bitter, with the sweetness of the molasses and caramel hanging in underneath. Full bodied and syrupy. Some alcohol present in the body, but more indirectly felt afterward. Finishes chocolatey/espresso-y bitter with underlying sweetness. Wow! Not sure what style they were going for, and perhaps it is too sweet (faintly) for an imp stout, but this would be up high with the taste and depth, if perhaps not super complex.

Heavy and intense maltiness with a fairly good amount of sweetness.  The malt is so thick and syrupy it coats the inside of the mouth and makes the finish last forever.  Heavy chocolate and licorice flavors mix with the oakiness, rounding out with some alcohol heat.  Thick, chewy, and full bodied with minimal soft carbonation.

1481,"2013-05-09",3.8,"In short: A monster black beer offering good complexity and relatively good drinkability.  Very good.
How: Bottle 750ml, corked & caged.  Consumed when probably one year of age or so.
The look: Black body topped by a very small tan head.
In long: Nose is big rich roasted malts, a strong woody sensation that resembles barrels (although Im almost 100% certain this beer has no barrel treatment).  Taste is rich roasted grainy cereals, all-grain brown bread, high-cacao content black chocolate, fudge, roasted almonds & nuts, black coffee, a bit of tar, a surprising herbal hops presence.  Very full body that doesnt feel too heavy because of a generous carbonation.  I dont know if it is because I let it sit in my cellar for a year but this beer was a lot less hot and aggressive than expected, this 13.2% monster beer was relatively easy to drink, I didnt feel the strength of the beer while drinking it, I only felt it after I went through the entire 750ml.  A good effort from a brewery that usually doesnt do it for me.  And what a strange coincidence, after a few bottles of Labyrinth I couldnt find my way out of the house, missed a family dinner, really, wife was a lot less impress by the Labyrinth coincidence and says I was just passed out, whatever.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1481,"2013-05-06",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2013 750 ml bottle.  Pours pitch black with a perfect 1 finger brown head that fades slowly and leaves some lacing.  Aroma is very rich, like chocolate cake.  Lots of sweet chocolate, ash, toffee, vanilla, charred oak, and light espresso.  Taste is like liquid chocolate cake batter.  Lots of vanilla and chocolate, moderately sweet with a very light bitterness.  Finish brings out some ashy, burnt wood tastes with some espresso.  A little black licorice taste lingers too.  Alcohol very well hidden but its obvious that this is a heavy beer.  Thick body and a creamy, oily mouthfeel.  Overall, this is a meal in a glass.  This could easily be considered an imperial stout and Im still a little fuzzy on what the difference is.  Intense flavors and this goes down way too easy for being 13%.  If there was some more bitterness and hops here it would be absolutely awesome.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
1481,"2013-05-06",3.7,"A - Pours as black as black can get. Concentrated light from the sun could not shine through this stuff. A big 2 finger tan head dissipated very slowly and provided little lacing.

S - Chocolate cake batter, dense caramel, molasses, roasted malt, toffee, dry oak, spicy alcohol, hints of licorice,

T - Bittersweet chocolate and milk/sugar coffee up front. The oak comes in early to suck up the sweetness and adds a good amount of vanilla to the mix. Sour berry fruit, roasted caramel malt makes adds another level and stays until the oak and hops sweep back in towards the finish. Finish is charred vanilla oak with hints of cocoa bitterness.

M - Full bodied, rich, silky, creamy, sticky.

This is a chocolate bomb! The oak is definitely present but not overpowering. Alcohol is mostly buried especially for 13.20. Its a big beer all the way around. This one will not disappoint.

A: Pours a pitch black color with an impressive thickness. The head is a three finger tan shade. Given its strength, Im quite impressed with the retention of the head.

S: The nose features licorice, chocolate, vanilla, mocha coffee, and a bit of roasted barley. Rock solid, but could have used more barrel influence.

T: The opening sweetness is moderately high, with a strong chocolate/vanilla character. Some coffee and licorice notes gradually build near the finish to counteract the (strong) sugary tones. It makes for a great dessert stout, only lacking in barrel character.

M: Thick, creamy, rich, decadent...every trait I look for in an imperial stout. The booze is superbly hidden, as well. Only thing I can nitpick is the slightly-too-high finishing astringency.

O: Subjectively, I dont really like the licorice-forward tendencies this offers...but I cant deny this is a very well-made product loaded with sophistication and finesse. Still, it could have been a genuine BCBS killer if it featured stronger oak qualities.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

1481,"2013-01-20",3.7,"2013.01.20 - Uinta Cooked Line Labyrinth - 750ml bottle in pint glass.  Bottled 06/07/12.

Pours inky dark.  A reddish mahogany head is pretty active very briefly, then pretty much disappears.  My first thought is it looks pretty much like an oatmeal stout.

Aroma is a little complex.  while the head is there it is mildly peppery. After the head disappears it is kind of roasty, kind of boozy, a bit smoky.  

Mouthfeel is a bit creamy/oily.  Basically no carbonation.

Taste follows aroma for the most part.   You can definitely detect the licorice taste, and some flavors from the oak.     Not necessarily a fair comparison, but a memory jogger:  New Holland Four Witches-ish with more licorice taste and booziness from the oak barrels.

5.0 A: Black color. Two and a half fingers of light brown, creamy head. Retention is very good, especially for a brew this big. Glass covering lacing is left.

4.5 S: Lots of licorice in this, which Im usually not a fan of, but it works so well with the rest of the aromas. Deep supple roastiness, rich dark chocolate, loads of molasses, and creamy caramel. The rye barrel plays a complementary role and adds a spicy earthiness and light leather. Very nice.

4.5 T: Taste is as good as the nose. Licorice starts things off again. Rich maltiness in the form of molasses, caramel, and dark chocolate. Heavy, though manageable roastiness. Rich and decadent - the flavors presented run deep. Again the rye adds a spicy earthiness and a bit of leather and vanilla. Booze doesnt come into play at all.

A: This beer pours a deep brown color, nearing black, with a thick inch of beige head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass.

The removal of the cork was one of the most difficult Ive come across, so, ultimately a classy-looking but obnoxious packaging. Usually one worries about getting out of a labyrinth, I was concerned Id never get in.

Appearance: Pours out a matte black, inky-looking body with a slow-growing, slow-receding, tan head. After the workout with the cork, I sure could use a beer!

Smell: Somewhat sweetish, roasty nose with a backdrop of wooden barrels, hunks from an oversized chocolate bar, and lighter, though not insubstantial notes of caramel, stewed fruit, and vanilla candy.

Taste: Bittersweet chocolate ganache, homemade caramel sauce, vanilla sugar, smooth espresso produced by an above-average barista, and, already, plenty of the licorice. Soundly sweet, but not overly so, though theres a noted richness about almost everything in the taste. Fruity accents of sweetish cherry and plums -- some sips its fairly tapered, others, its more pronounced and long enduring. Mildly tannic, mildly spicy barrel character. Only modesty warming on the relatively sweetish finish that fluctuatingly allows for the fruit, choco-licorice, or roastiness to lingering into the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Medium-light carbonation. Smooth, chewy mouthfeel.

Overall: Why, its like an imperialized, barrel-aged Kalamazoo! Some beers, right from that first sip, you think ""oh Jesus what have I gotten into this time"" as waves of disappointment and abject weariness wash over you. You may even stick it out like a trooper, perhaps wanting to get your moneys worth and/or hoping like a fool for a miraculous turnaround that never comes.

1481,"2011-04-18",3.3,"Pour is black.  Like, literally black.  The most opaque beer Ive ever seen, and Id wager I wont see another as dark anytime soon.

Almost no head, just a ring of brown foam floating at the top.

Mouthfeel is surprisingly light; probably the alcohol is thinning it up a bit.  The carbonation is very soft.  Not a flat beer, but no exuberance either.

Taste has an interesting, almost smoky background.  This probably comes from the barrel aging, as I dont think it has any smoked malt in it but it does taste like it.  I didnt pick up the licorice at all.  Chocolatey, toasty notes and that dark, earthy smokiness are the main characters of the taste.

The flavor found more licorice than anything else, and it was some tasty stuff.. tart oak and some bourbon sugars came on about halfway through, and became a touch metallic in the end.. vanilla beans, tangy oak, and peppery warmth over more licorice on the finish.

Nose: wood and charcoal, tar and char. Dry burnt chocolates. Rooty, black earth. Faint hint of vanillin and especially vanilla root still covered in moist dank black earth. Chopped firewood, raw and rough. Tickle of heat in the back reminds me of dried cayenne.

Palate: raw and hot from first quaff to last, lingering with an almost burning heat in the tummy akin to supping on liquid cayenne peppers coated in chocolate, earth, wood, vanilla, and melted caramel. Burnt chocolates are up front with burnt wood in the finish. Heat tinges the breath, like a campfire crackling hot whites and glowing embers. Long brittle ashen charcoal finish lingers long atop the tongue. Cinnamon sticks in with the cayenne. The edges of burnt fudge squares. Slowly sucks moister from mouth. Black root and black earth underneath.

Final Thoughts: great potential but extremely hot. The beer could have easily sat for a couple years, allowing the heat to smooth and settle while allowing all her lusciously dark flavors to meld and shine.

1481,"2011-01-07",4.7,"Poured into La Fin du Monde glass. Outstanding appearance: head is 2"" and doesnt go anywhere. Blackest bubbles Ive seen on a beer, very interesting. Aroma is very enticing: chocolate, some coffee, tons of roast. Very clean, refreshing. I dont know if I would have picked out licorice unless it was written on the bottle, but I can find hints of it if I try. Big, sweet, syrupy mouthfeel, with a huge kick of warmth--almost heat--at the end. Flavor is fantastic--complex with coffee beans, superdark chocolate, nice bitterness, a bit of whiskey. Sweet post-finish, after the warmth--almost too much after a few sips, as if in a sugary way. I havent had a beer this exciting in a while--great stuff. Solid lacing down the glass as you drink, as foreshadowed by the head. Excellent.","California, USA","cmc619"

Pours stouty in nature, mostly an impenetrable black that is topped with a fluffy medium tan head that lingers for a fair bit... Aroma of cocoa, molasses, a faint roast in addition to some vanilla and bourbon. Pretty solid actually... Cant say that there is much deviation from the aroma as the flavor is almost a smooth, straight transition. A subtle metallic, semi-sour note derails things for a moment but not to the point of making it a poorly crafted brew. Finish adds bitterness but not overwhelming by any means.

Adding to the fun is coffeeish and minor hop bitterness loaded up by a fair amount of abrasive alcohol. This starts fruity sweet and ends with big astrengent tones...and I like it!

1481,"2010-10-01",4.1,"Bottled on 06-10.  Interesting pour with a coal black body and a head which is initially average, light brown, and foamy but quickly fizzes down to a mostly diminishing, medium brown layer and leaves no lace.  The nose is nice with a prominent note of butter (buttery toffee and buttery toast), also toasted oak, faint vanilla, dark chocolate cake, underlying sweet espresso, molasses, and anise in there as well, maybe a slight black currant hint.  The flavor is similar with more sweet malt notes than anything but a bit more balance from bitter notes as well; dark chocolate is more prominent bordering on bakers chocolate, still molasses and anise, sweet espresso notes coming more into the picture, drying toasted oak notes, candied currants, and the buttery toffee notes diminishing.  The palate is full, warm (obviously, but the strength of the beer is well hidden by the malt notes and fitting to the structure of the beer), slightly chewy, coating, and almost lively; the carbonation level is bit much and probably contributed to the fizzy head.  The finish is still warm, but not hot, bittersweet, and long with similar espresso notes, bittersweet chocolate, light molasses and anise, and a lingering buttery note.  I am a bit surprised by the low ratings on this one, my only thought is that most found this to be a bit premature or just do not go for this style.  I, on the other had, love this style of sweeter, strong, American-style beers which differ from the thought of the stronger the beer, the more hops have to be thrown in or the darker the beer, the more roasted malts must be added.  While not at the level of an Old Viscosity, it is similar and still very nice.  From a brewery which I do not really tend to agree with, this one is quite nice.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

1481,"2010-08-06",2.6,"Aroma of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, anise, pine, some dark fruit. Flavor a lot sweeter and less roasty than I expected from the aroma. The dark fruit character expands, but in a rotten sort of way. Body quickly becomes syrupy, and that rotten fruit character just doesnt go away. There is some residual bitter chocolate, whose accompanying chalkiness is actually a welcome sort of dryness. Still though, big disappointment after the aroma for me.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

1481,"2010-07-07",3.3,"Bottle.

Head is initially average, frothy, brown, mostly lasting.
Body is opaque black (flashlight tested).

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted/burnt grain, chocolate/cocoa), with notes of raw wood, alcohol, vanilla, hint of cassis.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Full body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

Ya know, its not too far away from being solid...it just doesnt have enough depth and elegance to make it high 3 / low 4 kind of beer.  The alcohol is brutish, the aroma is a bit simple and brought down a notch by a raw sawdusty wood character. Its quite sweet and difficult to drink much of, especially as it warms...more bitterness or carbonation would help.  But...its certainly better than several other Impy stouts that are over 10% ABV. Not too bad for this brewery.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

1481,"2010-05-26",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2011 750 ml bottle thanks to Uinta and the utahbeerblog. Pours a pure black hue with a thick brown head and lots of lacing into my Uinta Barley Wine glass. The aroma is rich chocolates, molasses, rye, light bourbon and earthy notes. The flavor is a mix of spicy rye, earthy chocolates and roasted malts, sweet vanilla and bourbon, bittersweet chocolates. Lots of dark chocolates. Hot but not as hot as 13% suggests. Well made and unique. I was told that a Baltic Porter was the base for this and it shows. The two barrels used- rye and bourbon whiskey- work perfectly. Keep making this! Rich and milky with a lot of barrel goodness. Nice! 
Re-rate: about 6 months old. This beer really improves with some warmth, a great dark fruit and woody nose. Hot, spicy rye. Damn good. Unique in some ways.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
