214,"2017-06-13",4.3,"Light golden hue with a slight chill haze and a rocky white head. Lovely aromatic nose of citrusy and slightly herbal American hops with a light grassy Germanic touch and a light grainy pilsner malt base. Crisp delightful flavor thats dry and bright, full of floral and citrusy hop flavors and a bright German grassy kiss followed by a blonde crackery malt base that blends with a subtle black pepper and American floral hop tone. Super complex and interesting, delicate yet flavorful and thoughtful.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
