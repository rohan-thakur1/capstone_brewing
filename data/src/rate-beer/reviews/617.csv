617,"2014-11-09",4.0,"Tap @ Town Hall: Released as ""Three Hour Tour"", it is indeed a coconut milk stout. Black, squids ink color with a deep ecru layer of finely trimmed foam settled on top. Smells like a damn Mounds bar. Dark, dense, bittersweet baking chocolate, toasted coconut flakes, milky sweetness, & a dollop of marshmallow & vanilla to round things out. Tastes just like a liquid coconut candy bar, too. Nice elements of dark chocolate, coconut shavings, brown sugar, & vanilla. Gains some complexity as it warms, too, garnering deeper notes of roasted malt, toasted nuts, & marzipan. My only knock is that perhaps its a *touch* thin, but its hard to complain at under 6% ABV & packed with very nice flavor.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

A: Dark brown, with a small beige head that hangs out for a while before leaving a nice sheet of lacing on the glass.

S: Toffee, butter, coconuts, roasted malt, chocolate.

T: The beer is incredibly tasty and has greatly exceeded my expectations. I find it hard to believe that I am enjoying a beer brewed with coconuts to this degree. Coconuts and chocolate melded with roasted malt and buttery toffee candies make this a delicious beer. Its the perfect marriage of beer and a gourmet candy bar. The balance and harmony achieved with all of these bold flavors make this a special beer. Wow.

M: Not as sweet as I would have expected, but a bit on the sweet end of the spectrum, nonetheless.

A - Pours jet black with a two finger tall mocha colored head leaving small spots of lace down the entire glass.
S - Smells of rich coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and caramel. It has a lot going on, but in a good way. This one really does smell like a candy bar.
T - Starts off with a big dose of sweet coconut quickly giving way to a mix of chocolate, vanilla, caramel cream, and almonds. The sweetness is lactic but it never really gets to the point of being overpowering. The finish is pretty sweet, lingering on the pallet for some time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, creamy, feel with lots of sweetness. The feel really helps to bring this one together.

617,"2011-11-07",4.1,"Minneapolis Town Halls Three Hour Tour Coconut Milk Stout is full of coconut. Toasty, sweet, creamy. Its pitch black and sticks to the glass, but bounces off the palate like an Eagles player trying to tackle a Chicago Bear right now. The beer has a sweet finish thats not cloying, but the coconut does linger. A beer like this would pair well with food, and indeed it went great with the Indian food I had earlier. That said, the brew is so well-crafted and the head is such a deep tan that looking and feeling this beer is just as important as what it pairs with. Especially because right now, I wish this medium to full bodied coconut cake would pair with an Eagles win. Final words? Too sweet, too coconut, but if thats your thing, this beer is amazing. It reminds me of the milk stout version of MTHs Macaroon, and even if its too sweet, everyone needs a little cake once in a while.

Balanced with super smooth palate that finishes with a refreshing carbonation. Flavors of chocolate, malt, coconut and a bit of coffee, all followed by a rich toasted coconut finish. You wont want to drink a ton of this because it is pretty sweet, but it is very awesome. Normally Im not big on pairing beers with beers, but I tried this in the brew pub with a glass of wheat wine on the side and the fruity boldness of the wheat wine matched perfectly with the sweet coconut.","Richfield, Minnesota, USA","nsquishee"
617,"2011-05-17",4.2,"From growler at Holiday Wine Cellars private tasting in January 2011.  Thanks to whoever brought this...probably the same guy who brought the growler of Town Hall Manga Mama IPA.  Pours from growler near black.  Aroma has lots of great sweet roasted coconut up front followed by roasted malts, vanilla, and some chocolate.  Flavor is again full of rich semi-sweet roasted coconut along with lesser notes of roasted malts and chocolate.  Finish has more of that nice lingering roasted coconut.  Full body with light ABV helps make this really drinkable.  Strangely, Ken Schmidt himself was at this tasting.  I enjoyed his collaboration brew with Stone and Maui, but really felt that there was too little coconut (and macadamia) that was easily dominated by the big Kona coffee flavors.  I found this one from Town Hall to be better in execution.  (44, 565)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Pours nearly-black with a single-finger mocha head that settles down into a nice collar. A touch of lacing on the sides of my glass. The nose brings forward a lot of barrel character and chocolate as well as some chocolate and vanilla. Roasted malt and a bit of sweetness there as well. There is a moderate toasted coconut character in the background, though I couldnt have picked it out without knowing that it was there.

The chocolate and bourbon characteristics come out really well in the flavor. Ultra smooth and tasty. Good notes of vanilla and a bit of roast as well as some light cherry and toasted coconut. Really enjoying this. Very nice feel between the bourbon and a bit of booze. Perfect carbonation level. A really nice brew that grew on me as it warmed up and as I went through a few small glasses.

617,"2009-11-18",4.0,"Growler courtesy of Greg. Pours black. Nose is insane amounts of coconut, almond joy, cocoa, vanilla and roasty grains. Flavor is a rich sweet coconut, fresh vanilla bean, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. This is the most coconut flavor I have ever had in a beer. Awesome!","Alaska, USA","gkost"
617,"2009-11-12",4.0,"Growler, courtesy of Beerlando. Pours dark brown bordering on black with a tan short-lived head. Smells and tastes like the beer equivalent of a Mounds bar. Tons of chocolate and coconut, mild hints of almonds. Silk chocolate, sweet. Lush, silky mouthfeel that I think the coconut enhanced beyond the typical milk stout mouthfeel. You can really taste the coconut in this one. Very good.","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"
617,"2009-11-11",3.3,"Growler of Three Hour Tour.  Pours dark, almost black with tan head.  Aroma was strong coconut, chocolate and booze.  Taste is much of the same with more of milk added to the mix.  Very smooth.  Good to try, but not a must have for me.","Waunakee, Wisconsin, USA","MrPickles"
617,"2009-11-10",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2010 Growler of Three Hour Tour.  Pours almost black, showing a deep, dark mahogany color in the light.  A thin, light brown head shows at the head, leaving some spotty splotches of lacing behind on the glass.  The aroma is that of a straight up liquid Mounds bar, insanely chocolaty, showing both rich semi-dark and creamy milk varieties, with loads of coconut and velvety lactose.  Seriously, thought the nose is simple, its absolutely mouth watering, invoking notes of my favorite childhood candy bar. Flavors follow suit exactly, chocolaty as can be, with more natural coconut flavor than any beer I can recall.  Layer after layer of creamy, lightly bitter chocolate and luscious, fatty coconut meat prove to be a match made in heaven, and the milky lactose fits in perfectly as well.  The palate proves creamy, silky, and oily, showing not so much as a hint of alcohol.  Perfectly carbonated, it glides right down the throat with substantial viscosity and a soothing feel.  This beer is proof that a simple concept, if perfectly executed, can be just an intensely enjoyable as the most complex of brews.  Fantastic.  Right up there with Shorts Über Goober as one of the best sweet stouts Ive ever had.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
617,"2009-11-09",3.2,"Sampled at GABF 2009 as 3 hour tour.  Dark pour, looks pretty nice.  Aroma of chocolate, candy, some lactic notes.  Flavor is chocolate and coconut.  And some milk stout qualities.  Yeah, Cant really do the coconut thing, but glad I tried it.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
617,"2009-11-07",3.1,"black pour with a tan head.  Aroma is up friend chocolate and coconut.  Flavor is just blatant coconut with a bit of lactose and chocolate behind.  Finishes too sweet,  good carbonation.  I couldnt finish my pint,  too sweet.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
617,"2009-11-07",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2009 Tap at Town Hall.  Black pour, head quickly dissipates.  Chocolate/coconut aroma and flavor, sweet tasting.  Smooth & creamy finish.  This stuff is like a Mounds bar in a pint glass.","New Hope, Minnesota, USA","13mikey"
617,"2009-11-07",3.9,"Sample at GABF 2009. Pours a dark brown to black color with thin white head. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of caramel, honey, coconut, nuts, chocolate, light roast. Flavor is about the same. Medium body with a pleasing malty coconut finish. Interesting ale.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
617,"2009-11-03",4.2,"Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you dont.  well this one is loaded with toasted coconut, brown sugar and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is amazing.  Damn I really like everything TH makes.  wish I could try more.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
617,"2009-11-02",3.6,"On draft at the brewery. Near black in colour with low carbonation. Aromas are of toasted coconut, milk chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of caramel. Flavor is like a macaroon, with loads of toasted coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and toasted malts. Fairly sweet and slick in the mouth, but remains quite drinkable. A tad more roasty, and this would have been a blockbuster. As it stands, its still very good.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
617,"2009-10-30",4.0,"Sample thanks to MaSciGuy. Pour is Absolute black with a very thin brown head.  Looks awesome.  Aroma is huge malt and (not surprisingly) huge coconut.  Also notes of vanilla, brown sugar, hints of dark dried fruits, and very subtle smoke.  Man, this smells amazing.  Flavor is malty with a nice coconut kick up front.  Also notes of chocolate, coffee, and tobacco.  Mouthfeel is just a little thinner than i was hoping for.  Actually a fairly light stout and very easy to drink.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
617,"2009-10-28",3.9,"Growler.  Dark black pour, dark brown (and quickly dissipating carbonation) and a rich coconut aroma.  Flavor starts off with big creamy coconut, then nice smoke/roasted malt and finished a little chocolatey.  Very good stuff.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
617,"2009-10-27",2.9,"Growler shared by MrPickles - Pours dark with a smallish tan head. Expected coconut, got tons of soy sauce on the nose. Searched hard for the coconut and got a bit hiding behind the soy sauce, but it still smelled salty and boozy. Taste is better, with the coconut milk much more apparent and the soy sauce receding. You get a little roast in there too. Body is smooth and medium-light. Expected a bit more heft on this one. Wouldnt try again.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

light Chocolate and a big coconut on top of a bit of lactose, very sweet, light and easy to drink.  Tastes a bit to much like an almond joy bar for my liking, but not bad.  If you like coconut candy more you might really love this.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
617,"2009-10-12",4.0,"GABF 2009.  This was really great, up there with the Stone/Maui/Ken Schmidt coconut porter.  Black in color with a nice lasting tan head.  Aroma is coffee, chocolate, roast, and coconut.  Flavor is an awesome blast of coconut mixed seamlessly with a great stout - roasted malt, mild coffee, and dark chocolate.  Long finish.  Palate is smooth and creamy with medium body.  Very nice beer overall.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
617,"2009-02-10",3.8,"They aint lying, there is coconut all over.  Black color, and nearly still.  Coconut aroma and coconut flavor.  Lots of it.  Moderate roasted malt, a solid stout under the coconut.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
617,"2009-02-09",4.2,"On draught during Winterfest 2009 in St Paul, MN. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thick tan head that quickly dissipates to a tan ring. Aroma of coconut, rich dark chocolate, some toasted dark malt and a hint of flowery hops. Taste is smooth and creamy, medium to full bodied, with flavors of dark chocolate and coconut with no bitterness. Finish is almost like having a liquid Mounds candy bar. Rich dark chocolate and coconut flavors overall. One of my favorites of the evening.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
617,"2009-02-08",4.1,"oh my coconut. pours a pitch dark brwn with dark tan head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is of sweetened condensed coconut flakes with creamy choc. notes. Flavor is similar to cream that is boiled with coconut flakes. Malty notes present. Body is fairly light for how dark it is. Mild carbonation. Just very well done. Flavor are extremely well balanced","Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA","Tripplebrew"
