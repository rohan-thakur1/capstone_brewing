1798,"2014-12-10",4.8,"From notes. This was shared at a tasting put on by @mikem409 on November 7. The pour on this baby is a thick, viscous, oily black with a tannish leather colored head, that falls down to a film. The aroma, Jesus, is like a brownie. A delicious fudge brownie. There is a little coffee and a lot of maple, vanilla and a heavy dose of molasses. Its ridiculous. The flavor is also incredible. There is a beautiful chocolate and molasses brownie with a hint of maple and the bourbon is just a little light. Vanilla accents over the whole thing bring it together beautifully. The mouth feel is a little lighter than I was hoping for. There is a nice carbonation that helps it seem thicker than it is. The aftertaste is lingeringly chocolatey and delicious. Hot damn. This is just great!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1798,"2014-11-17",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2015 Bottle: Deep, oily black pour with a rich, leathery tan layer of foam settled across the top. Holy fuck. Aroma is incredible. Smells like a fresh batch of triple chocolate lava meltdown fudge brownies, drizzled in a bourbon & chocolate reduction. Goddamn. Insane chocolate & cake batter sweetness, robustness & warmth from the booze, a hint of vanilla & wood in there, too. Amazing. Taste carries through with a huge brown batter & chocolate fudge cake element. Mild creamy sweetness, the faintest hint of roast & char. Some more warmth from the bourbon but still far from harsh. Lighter undertones of brown sugar, vanilla, & molasses. All in all, its a chocolate brown batter BOMB. And its awesome.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

The flavor starts with huge chocolate, molasses, and molasses. The finish has light vanilla, maple syrup, and a hint of bourbon. Its medium-full bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat soft mouthfeel.

Very sweet, with just a hint of a sour finish. Heavy body, sticky and syrupy, with a boozy, warming finish. Overall, this is a delicious, well made beer. The coffee is pleasant in the aroma, and not overbearing or bitter in the flavor, and the bourbon complements it nicely.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
1798,"2014-01-27",3.3,"Cask sample at ACAT 2014. First brew of the day. Pours thick dark black with brown head. Aroma was of roasted malts, vanilla, cocoa, wallop of bourbon. Taste was bitter cocoa, some coffee, lighter than the nose indicated bourbon. It finished with a bit of an odd yeast flavor that I did not agree with and some noticeable alcohol. Now, I never had the original to see if I would have liked that, but Westbrook normally does no wrong in my book.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
