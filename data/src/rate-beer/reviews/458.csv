458,"2017-05-03",3.6,"On tap @ Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2016. This one has a deep dark brown colored body with a medium sized light beige dotting head. Smells like elder coffee with sugar and paper. Wood? Cocoa dryness. All in all it smells quite nice. Tastes really good also. Super lightdrinkable and theres a sweetish licorice tone in it. Not an extreme amount of coffee but whats there tastes quite good. Thin espresso from a machine. Mainly chocolate and chocolate milk here actually and who doesnt like that. 14.05.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Brune foncée, col épais et tenace crémeux café au lait.
Arôme est plaisamment bien torréfié sans jamais tomber dans lexcès, ce dernier se retrouve pas mal au niveau de la mousse. La vanille est, quant à elle, plus discrète et subtile apportant une petite pointe de douceur en rétro-nasal. Rétro porte aussi qcq effluves de chocolaté, le houblon perce discrètement conférant des pointes de fraicheur.
Palais est malté, grillé superbement bien torréfié avec une base vanille qui apporte une bonne balance. Amertume portant un effet houblonné noble balance le tout et est accompagnée de notes herbacées.

Round in mouth in spite of a watery feeling in mouth. Not particularly malty despite the roasted components. I could not pick up the oatmeal dose at all. Really geared toward the aromatic vanilla, even more so than the coffee which remains very well integrated and soft, gently smokey, just lightly roasty with no astringency at all and minimal acidity. I can see how this is a crowd pleasure, its a seductive flavour profile.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The flavor is real rich but balanced by a nice deep roasted malt backbone. Chocolate and roast upfront with coffee lingering after the sip. Vanilla is also notable and this stout never becomes overly sweet. Mild bitter chocolate. At the gravity level this has a ton of flavor! Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and gives a velvet texture.

The head is a nicely brown tinged, dark tan colored head. There is a really a huge coffee aromatic note, almost floral, blackened caramel, concentrated dark chocolate notes, rich deeply toasted nutty notes, supporting vanilla notes, and really just a huge, complex coffee character to the nose.

Quite dry, very bitter, burnt, roasted, almost coke like roasted character, but up front lots of dark chocolate notes, lots of roasted nutty notes, and a touch of roasted, dark caramel notes. The body is fairly light, and could perhaps use a touch more richness as a beer, as it rests on the palate a bit too much like a cup of cold coffee; it is a bit on the thin side, for a beer that is well balanced by the expressive coffee notes. 

Deep, rich, coffee notes, floral roasted aromatics, burnt caramel, rich vanilla, and really just a complex coffee character are so noticeable and balanced in this beer. This is definitely a beer for coffee lovers, if you do, it is incredibly complex and charcterful, but if you dont, then it could be overwhelming and one-dimensional.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
458,"2013-11-16",4.0,"32oz growler pours with a nice dark looking mahogany colored body that supports a light mocha colored head of foam. The aroma is straight up big fresh kind of dusty dark roasted coffee grounds and a light degree of chocolate and earthiness at the end of the draw. This taste has the same dark roasted coffee goodness where it almost seems like a grain or two of coffee grounds are rolling around my palate. Behind the big coffee notes are some mild chocolate and vanilla that help even out all the roastiness. All of those notes ride into the finish where theyre greeted by a sliver of a mineral sort of note. Nice.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
458,"2013-11-15",3.9,"Thanks to GT2 for sharing! Pour is dark black with large tan head. Rich coffee aroma with warm vanilla. Taste is tons of coffee, some cinnamon, a hint of vanilla. Its got a lot of coffee without being too acidic, but if you dont like the taste of coffee, you wont like this beer. I like coffee, so I think its great. The palate is a bit thin and could use maybe a bit more sugar or richness to balance it out, but otherwise this is a good offering overall.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
458,"2013-11-15",3.9,"32oz growler thanks to Ibrew2or3. Clear, lighter brown pour, thick light tan head with incredible formation and retention. Rocky, sheen hop content driven head. Great, complete lacing everywhere. Nose is more in the decadent vanilla and robust espresso vain, dry Kenyan/Ethiopian powerful roast. Taste isnt too acidic, though it is still coffee and roasted malt derived acidic/tart but it isnt lemony, with a thinner than expected body. Still, it is not watery and is very bitter from both the powerful roast and hefty hop content. Overall, as a non coffee drinker and a skeptic for all coffee beers, I enjoyed this a lot and so did my much more picky stout and coffee loving wife, biggirlpanties. If I had to pick one descriptor, it really tastes a lot like a high quality mega espresso.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
458,"2013-09-22",4.3,"Its basically just a cup of coffee. Im considering filling a mug tomorrow before work! Huge roasty flavor, lots of ground coffee flavor. Have you ever had chocolate covered espresso beans? This is a liquid form of that. I can actually imagine the little crunch and bits of coffee between nay teeth while I drink it. This is fantastic.","Arizona, USA","JustDrinkIt"
458,"2013-09-21",4.3,"32 oz. growlette from Daknole. Thanks! It pours black with a nice creamy tan head. The aroma is huge with fresh ground coffee, dark chocolate, hints of vanilla sweetness and herbal hops. The flavor is the same. Massive coffee flavors without any acidity or astringency. Dark chocolate and a little herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Amazing stuff and very drinkable. Maybe my favorite coffee beer to date!","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
458,"2013-09-09",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2014 Tried the latest batch. They finally nailed it imo. Perfect amount of coffee aroma, and the coffee taste was in perfect balance to the rest of the beer. On nitro so it had that glorious creamy mouthfeel.","","Metallion66"
458,"2013-09-08",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2014 On nitro at the brewery (batch 3). Dark brown in appearance with a khaki-colored, craggy two-fingered head. Clean, fresh-roasted coffee beans dominate the aroma; roasted malts, bitter, earthy spices, some cacao nibs, and traces of vanilla also add to the nose. Extremely roast-forward flavor, from both the coffee and malts, that transitions to a clean coffee taste with a bold yet pleasant vanilla sweetness. Medium body with a great creamy texture and slight lingering roasty bitter finish. This batch on nitro is an improvement over the first batches on CO2; the creaminess and vanilla flavor kicks in up a notch.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
458,"2013-09-08",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2013 At the brewery, black pour, tan head. Aroma is very coffee forward with some vanilla in the mix. Taste has espresso, vanilla and a little bitter dark chocolate in the finish. Update: After a day, the finish has mellowed a little bit. Even smoother and better now.  Excellent!","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
458,"2013-09-08",4.4,"Coffee heaven! Pours a mostly clear dark brown color. Aroma? Coffee! And more coffee! Fresh brewed coffee, hints of vanilla, roasted malt, a slight bitter finish. If you dont like coffee this isnt for you.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
