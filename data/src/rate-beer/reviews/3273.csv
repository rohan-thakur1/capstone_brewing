Aroma of typical Sante yeast/microbe goodness, some pale and sweet malts, light citrus, light oak. Flavor the same but a boozy finish. Average texture. Even Sante Adairius can be ruined by Prairie...

3273,"2016-07-18",3.4,"750 mL bottle. Hazy orange. Small white head. Smells of citrus, stone fruit, light acidity, and doughy malt. Tastes of stone fruits and a little bit of tartness.

3273,"2016-07-10",3.9,"Bottle @ Mikes House. Thanks, Mike! Feel like the name of this beer is at least indirectly aimed at me. Nice clear golden straw colored beer with a white head and lively carbonation. Other than a bit of residual sweetness and somewhat of a canned peach note, wouldnt have pegged this as a Tripel... Pretty nice acidity and tartness, and certainly quite citrus forward. Light vanilla, some leathery funk, oak, and orange peel. Light bitterness and actually, a fair amount of fresh orange juice. Neat beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
