3321,"2014-04-06",4.0,"Tap at Metzgerbräu in Nov. 2013: Bronze with hues of golden. Creamy but broken white foam. Assertive mineral and breadcrust aromas line the nose alongside sharp lager yeast, mild sulfur, fallen leaves, browned toffee, hazelnut cookie, and nougat. Very clean and focused. Lush, stiff carbonation. Candyish, breadcrust-laden malt collides with a peppery intensity, initially. Rivetingly complex malt reveals stacks upon stacks of toffee richness swirled with more delicate milk chocolate and a springy tandem of tobacco and pecan skin. Assertively woody, vividly-defined hop punch yields a lemony herbality as well as a considerably spicy fennel seed quality. Malt is strikingly refined and well structured, throughout, and features plenty of earthy elements like nut skin and fallen leaves to elevate the level of drinkability and intrigue. A pronounced yeasty tickle precedes a stiff cocoa-tinged dryness and a nice punch of coarse minerals in the melanoidin-rich, licoricey hop finish. A rather multilayered example...earthy, candyish, and breadcrusty. Yum!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3321,"2013-12-04",4.0,"A beautifully malty unfiltered dunkles German landbier. The yeast provides roundness and adds a soft doughiness to the already rich toffee, roasted nuts and just-baked bread crusts malt character. Medium to low bitterness and mild acid sit well on a minerally, crusty, firm, slightly sweet malt body. A joy to smell and drink.  Vom fass at Metzgerbräu.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3321,"2013-11-25",4.0,"Draft at the meat shop in Uetzing.
Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.
Body is dark amber to medium brown.
Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, roasted nuts), lightly to moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), with notes of peach and orange blossom honey.
Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter.
Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation.
I had very low expectations for this based on the plain little shop it was purchased in, but wow, this is a fantastic, heavily toasted, clean, and well-balanced dark-ish Landbier. Another example of not being able to judge a book by its cover.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3321,"2012-08-07",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2017 My Bottom Line :  
This butchers brew showcases toasted nuts, lean but caramelized cereals and water-y minerals before apricot-like, leafy hops balance out the finish.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam clings to the pale amber mist.
-This might be lighter in alcohol than Annafest brews, but it is remarkably similar in flavor profile (caramelized sugars on top of leafy hop bitterness). 
-The nose and first half of each sip are mostly malty.
-The soft, natural carbonation could be amped up a bit to provide more comfort in the mouthfeel.
-The label on the swing-top bottle actually smells like smoked sausage! Hows that for a charming touch!

3321,"2010-05-11",3.3,"1 liter bottle of fresh beer that should be consumed quickly. Its hazy, copper with a huge, creamy head. The aroma has notes of malt, caramel and light butterscotch.
