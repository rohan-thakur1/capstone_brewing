585,"2015-04-06",4.1,"750 ml. bottle from the Sierra Nevada gift shop in Chico. A powerful sour smell came out of the bottle on opening which was a bit disconcerting (especially considering that Ive probably held on to this bottle too long). That followed into the glass and the taste along with some very nice dark cherry and raisin flavors. But as this warmed up, the sour became a nice wooden barrel flavor that enhanced the fruit and emerging sour apple taste. This is a beautiful looking beer with a crystal clear dark amber/orange color with an appropriately small head of light tan foam. Eventually a vineous character comes out with sweet caramel, vanilla and honey flavors and whiskey-like alcohol fumes. This literally gets better with every sip and should definitely be served at proper cellar temperature (or a bit higher). Leaves a nice toffee sweetness and wood barrel flavor behind. I hope Sierra Nevada releases this again and that Im lucky enough to be there when they do.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
585,"2015-03-09",3.4,"Rated on 9-14-2013 at Fort Wayne, IN RateBeer gathering (bottle courtesy of patrick767). The appearance is a small fizzy tan head that mostly diminished, amber transparent body, no carbonation observed, and no lacing. The aroma is oak, raisins, cherries, sour, tart, and some brandy. The flavor is sweet, vanilla, tart, brandy, oak, and light vanilla. The mouthfeel has a warming sensation and this beer is light bodied. Overall, this is a sipping beer and complex. There is a lot going on with this beer. It would be a good winter beer on a snowy night.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

585,"2014-09-05",3.7,"This one comes down to wether or not you like brandy. 2 years in the barrel fairly well obliterated any trace of the base brew. Only light light belgian yeasty esters and a touch of malty sweetness were left. Lots of barrel in this sipper. Not the most complex brew in the world, but I dug it. Good brandy. Sweet lingering finish.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

585,"2014-07-09",3.4,"Bottle, passagen. Mahogany brown, clear. Spicy nose with some sort of sweet oaky port-oxidized prunes, brown maltyness, yeasty fruity esters. Medium bodied, bit oily, but bitter nuff to cut through. Sweet dried dark fruits, oakyness, some overripe apples. Lots of flavours, but hard to say where its going. I would take it as an oak aged barley wine.","FINLAND","jookos"
585,"2014-05-16",3.5,"Bottle bought @ Systembolaget. Pours chestnut brown with a small beige head that doesnt leave much trace on the glass while dissipating. Smell is estery, tiny phenolic, tiny fruity and boozy with caramel, toffee, sweet dark bread, dark honey, heavy brandy, moist charred wood, raisins, pear skins, black pepper corns, vanilla fudge, caramelized apples, lemon zest and alcohol. Taste is tiny sour, malty, slightly estery and tiny phenolic with dark bread, toffee, heavy brandy, raisins, plums, pear skins, apple skins, charred wood, vanilla fudge, alcohol, sweet desert wine, black pepper corns and hints of red wine vinegar. Mouthfeel is dry, soft, boozy and medium to full bodied. Finish is tiny sour with dark bread, brandy, raisins, plums, lemon juice,charred wood, vanilla fudge, toffee, alcohol and black pepper corns. Strange and very boozy. Dominating brandy and not even close to a traditional dubbel but the brandy character smells and tastes like good brandy so its not all bad.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

585,"2013-12-05",3.1,"750 ml. bottle. It pours a deep red/purple color with a disappearing head. The aroma is strong with sour red wine and acetone. A touch of maltiness. The flavor is very alcoholic and mildly tart with brandy notes, acetone, sour plum, raisins. Thin body for the ABV. The finish is a bit more pleasant with more of the tart fruitiness and warming barrel notes. Not really a fan of this one.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
585,"2013-10-31",3.2,"Deep amber color out of the bottle with a foamy beige head. The nose reminded me of brandy. Sweet beer with caramel and loads of oak and brandy. Seems a bit thin and boozy.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
585,"2013-10-09",3.5,"Aroma is fairly fruity with lots of prunes, figs, raisins and cherries. Moderate brandy notes with light oak tannins. Light tartness and faint vanilla notes. Some candi sugar and caramel with a light toffee character. 
Pours a cloudy brown with a thin tan head that recedes quickly to the edges where it then lingers.
Flavor is initially somewhat tart with a lot of fruit character of cherries and plums. The tartness does help balance what would otherwise be a very sweet beer, but I cant help but wonder if this was intended. Light vanilla and oak character with some alcohol spice in the finish. Some raisin and prune as well with caramel and dark candi sugar. Medium light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low acidic astringency and medium alcohol warmth. 
Overall an interesting beer but I am not sure the flavors and aromas are as intended. The tartness does work and balances out the sweetness of a typical dubbel. Lots of fruitiness persists with a light oak and brandy flavor.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
