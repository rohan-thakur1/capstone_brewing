 Kolor:  Żółty, klarowny. 
 Piana:  Biała jak śnieg, średnio oczkowa, przechodząca w drobne oczka.
Piana przez kilka dobrych minut utrzymuje się na powierzchni. Potem opada w dół do cienkiego kołnierzyka. 
Na krawędziach kielicha nie uświadczy się nawet jednej kropeczki. 
 Zapach:  Zaraz po otworzeniu puszeczki zaczął do moich nozdrzy docierać silny aromat żółtych i pomarańczowych owoców.
Zapachniało brzoskwiniami, morelami, ale też i słodkim mango.
Na przeciwległej płaszczyźnie lekkie fenolowe nuty, które wraz z ogrzewaniem przybierają na sile.
W oddali trawa cytrynowa i nuty cytrusów.

 Smak:  W smaku wybitnie ziołowe, 
a z drugiej strony mocno owocowe.
Najwięcej tutaj brzoskwini, moreli i dojrzałych pomarańczy. W kontrze do owocowych nut nadchodzą przyprawowe fenole: lekki goździk, pieprz, może lekka kolendra. 
Od czasu do czasu też przewinie się skórka cytryny.
Nutki ryżowe są bardzo delikatne.

742,"2017-03-29",3.6,"Poured from a 16 oz can with a best before date of Oct. 2017. 
Aroma is fairly fruity with some stone fruit esters as well as quite a bit of pear and some light banana notes. Light grain notes and some floral esters with rose being most prevalent. 
Pours a somewhat clear, fairly bright gold color with a large, somewhat thin, rocky white head that recedes quickly to a thin film that lingers for a bit in clumps on the edges. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is slightly sweet initially with some grain notes but with a super dry, almost astringent finish with lingering grain notes. Some light esters with pear, stone fruit, banana and rose being the most prevalent. Medium to medium high bitterness that is accentuated by the dryness. 
Mouthfeel is light to medium light bodied with medium high carbonation. Medium astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer, but the dryness is a bit much for me. Maybe if I was eating a salty snack, but by itself it is a bit strong and astringent.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

The juicy, lemony hop notes make for a lovely conclusion; they give this beer a bright, juicy finish. However, they dont impart too much oiliness or bitterness, so the hops preserve this beers delicate and hugely refreshing feel.

742,"2016-11-14",3.2,"Can (BB Oct 2017).

Head is initially average sized, frothy/fizzy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy light yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, lemon oil), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a light note of lemon zest / lemongrass.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Light to medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively/fizzy carbonation. 

To me, a saison really needs to provide equal intrigue from the malt, hops, and yeast (both the raw character and the fermentation effects). This comes off like a light pale/golden ale more than anything else...theres not too much Belgian about it IMHO. Its a fairly decent and drinkable beer in general, though...the flavor balance is enjoyably quaffable, its clean, and if the rather one-dimensional citrus-centric aroma was enough to keep beckoning sips, this would be a winner. Its a potential ""mindless summer slammer"" contender, but alas...its no longer summer in this hemisphere (although admittedly still unseasonably warm).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

742,"2016-11-04",4.1,"Draught at Canary Square, 10/31/16.High clarity in this flaxen-golden body with a small, off-white head showing moderate to low retention.Lemme tell you, this thing was served in a packed bar out of a shaker and Ill be damned if it didnt have one hell of an aroma. Canteloupe, pepper, vanilla, honey and a lovely tangerine-nectarine hop character with lemon, spice and earthy, grainy rice and malt notes lingering. Very amazing aroma indeed, for its size and no alcohol or flaw.Earthy, lightly cereal-like grains in the mouth provide melon, vanilla, cornmeal and rice notes as the soft, fuzzy, tangerine and nectarine-like hop notes tickle the senses in concert with light, but fine carbonation. Soft honey, biscuits and tons of melon, lime and tangerine juiciness lingering with light phenolics and minerality.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

742,"2016-09-30",3.5,"$3 pint can from Wine Warehouse. Apparently I havent had enough alcohol this week because this is day #6 of being semi-sick. Pours hazy yellow with a large white head.

Maybe it is, I suppose I should know, OK, lets say it is. This is zippy.

Edited to add: And look at that - rating right below me says zippy too... completely independent of my review so this beer must be zippy. And its a real word.

Edited again: I let it warm and the flavors began to stand out and I enjoyed the beer more. Giving it a +1 to taste and +1 to overall.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"

The aroma is floral and a little bit yeasty, Its got some light citrusy fruitiness. Its zippy and inviting on all accounts. 

The flavor is moderately bitter and very dry. Its got an herbal hoppiness and its got a nice fruity hoppiness too. Its pleasantly floral and fairly clean all around.

742,"2016-09-29",3.8,"Aroma - lemony citrus, some resin, and also floral hops.
Appearance - the body is a hazed golden color. The head about 1/3"" and settles fast into a film.
Taste - dry hops that range from citrus, floral, and slight resin. There is an almost club soda quality here. Little lime and pumice stone like. Very clean and refreshing.
Palate - light body, carbonation is average, the finish is extremely dry and clean. Very unique.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
742,"2016-09-21",2.9,"Canned on 5/16/16. Misty pale yellow. Voluminous white foam quickly dissipates into a wispy collar. Simple and airy aroma of grapefruit pith and resin. Quiet notes of celery seed, lemon, flowers, herbs and cracker. Expressive, prickly carbonation. Notes of orange pith overwhelm the flimsy palate on initial sip. Lemony hops shyly hang from the soft pils malt which yields a distant haylike dimension, but is otherwise a non-factor. Coarse herbality and a scallionlike pungency collide with obnoxious resinous overtones, and the stark body exacerbates the resins which become gratingly chalky on subsequent sips. Finishes one-dimensionally hoppy and overly sharp, with tannic bitterness prevailing over the vaguest trail of dry cracker. Saison-inspired, eh? Seems like more of an American pale ale with its predictable and rudimentary acidic hop character thats comprised of mostly citrus and resin. Either way, there just isnt much soul or depth to make this enjoyable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Aromas of big lemon, peach, pear, apple, orange peel, white wine, grapefruit, peppercorn, rice, white bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness.

Large amount of peppery yeast spiciness and citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange rind, peach, pear, apple, white wine, grapefruit, peppercorn, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and light pale malt flavors; with with minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, crisp, dry, and fairly sticky/resinous mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very nice and unique saison. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and light pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink. This was pretty aggressive on bitterness, but wasnt astringent due to the very crisp and dry finish. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

742,"2016-07-25",3.3,"Pint can from Old Town; shared with Boo. Aroma: Complex hop profile that is reminiscent of lemongrass; Chardonnay; lighter lime and floral accents; grains are super light and almost a non-factor aroma-wise. Appearance: Pale, slightly hazy yellow pour with lively carbonation holding up a foamy white head that settles into a patchy ring. Flavor: They werent kidding about extra dry... hops gravitate towards the more fruity lime/chardonnay character, but is very dry in terms of grains; the finish is quite dry and lightly bitter and I could use the word dry a few more times. Dry. Palate: Light body, slick texture, lively carbonation, abrupt finish.
