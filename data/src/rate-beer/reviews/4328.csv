Nose is sweet oily toffee, low oxidation, orange peel, sugar. Taste is boozy orange peel, toffee marmalade, oily, more monolithic in taste than you would expect, bit boozy with toffee. Body is warming oily toffee, marmalade, oily. Feels like it might benefit a bit from a touch more oxidation so well made & well suited fro aging as inteded. Nice work for sure.

Taste is very alcoholic, bitter hops, marmalade. The booziness made it undrinkable, perhaps this was a bad bottle, because everything else I have tried from this brewer has been excellent at best and drinkable at worst.","Moscow, RUSSIA","YantarCoast"

Dark golden color, thin head. Intensive sweet belgian-like phenolic and malty aroma. Taste is really close to heavy belgian sweet ales but too sweet and this combination isnt working for me cause this yeast and this malty profile making this beer bit unpleasant. +0,2 for a rare style","Moscow, RUSSIA","magicmn"

4328,"2016-05-19",3.8,"At LIBF. Now here is an interesting idea: the English city of Burton became famous for its brewing water which was deemed ideal for 19th-century India pale ale, but it already had this tradition of malty Burton ales long before that, and this style too, basically a local variant of English strong ale, was very popular in England for a long time - until it became all but extinct. Victory Art now has this resurrection of the style - Russia probably being the last country Id associate with a historical style this traditionally British. Anyway: medium sized, pale greyish beige head, clear and beautiful coppery bronze robe. Aroma of toffee, honey, fig, caramel candy, gingerbread, rusty iron, apple peel. Sweet and fairly clean dried fruit sweetness, very caramelly and smooth malt body, bit resinous even, gaining a very softly bittering toasted edge in the end as well as a dash of soft herbal and vaguely floral hops and warming, brandy-like alcohol; caramelly and even somewhat brown sugar-like sweetness gets the last word. Rremarkable how these guys have produced an old fashioned, thoroughly malty English style strong ale without any authentic examples to refer to. Nice!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4328,"2016-05-18",3.6,"Bottle @ LIBF16. Shared with the RB Belgian team.
Laissons aux russes le plaisir de remettre au gout du jour lancien style de DBA, celui-ci plus atypique avec ces 11% et donc moins en vue que les versions plus légères.
Couleur orange, col léger blanc voire blanc-cassé.
Arôme ay nez assez plaisant, finement houblonné avec des traces anglaises versant vers le noble type EKG et Fuggles.
Palais offer un profil consequent au niveau des malts avec une touche de toffee et presque de léger biscuité. Alcool est bien là avec une dose de douceur de sucre résiduel.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
