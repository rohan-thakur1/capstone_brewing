2039,"2017-05-07",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2017 750 ml bottled 2/24/17 and listed at 8%, purchased at Small Batch Liquors. Brown appearance with a tan head. Aroma of toasted grain, tart fruits, nutty malts, light oak and hints of earth and vanilla. Similar flavor, rich, malty, mildly acidic/sour and lightly vinous. Smooth, mild puckering feel with a lingering, light dry finish. Nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
2039,"2016-12-04",3.7,"Bottle shared on site. Dark brown, with a big, bubbly, beige head. Rye, toffee, dates, licorice, and chalk. Sweet and malty, with a touch of tartness. Medium body, smooth and creamy. This is an oddity for Casey; a malt forward beer. Quite tasty and unique.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
2039,"2016-11-07",3.8,"Bottle. Brown pour with a kaki head. Nice sour notes give way to caramel malts. Oak and barrel backbeats. Good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
2039,"2016-11-07",3.4,"750 mL bottle. Pours deep brown. Medium white head. Smells very nutty and malty. Toasty malt. Kinda nutty. Tastes surprisingly sour. Lemon tartness that becomes deeper from the dark malts. Almost becomes like a sour cherry, but never quite broaches the fruit territory. Toasty malt. Pretty sour. Well carbonated. Medium body. Its not what I expected. Dark malts dominate and it never really melds together.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
2039,"2016-11-06",3.4,"Bottle at WTWBA 2016. Murky brown pour with a big head. Malty, some sour citrus. A little dry. Okay.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
2039,"2016-11-03",4.2,"First batch almost 2 years old. Clear brown. Nose is some tart cherry, dark sour funk, some earth. Taste is dark malt core with sour finish. Lots of tart dried sour cherry flavor, dark farmhouse funk. Reminds me of a lighter Cuvee de Tomme maybe, but more in the Flanders vein than a bier de garde but great beer regardless.  Great balance. Loved this.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
2039,"2016-08-28",4.2,"Bottle in Seattle. Another hat tip to Pruf for sending these gems my way. Another big winner out of this box. Bright ring foam, very dark leathery brown opaque pour. Oak, leather, tobacco depths on nose. Body adds a red fruit flavor, tart cherry, raspberry and some strawberry sweetness. Fantastic. Leather tobacco undertones. BdG is an interesting idea but the dark oaky barrel takes this in an interesting direction. Just fantastic.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
2039,"2016-08-22",3.7,"Bottle at Culmination Fest 16: Poured a caramel brown to black with a bubbly off white to tan head. Was not expecting that color, it was very interesting. Aroma is a tart wood, oak, but there is that maltiness. Taste is very interesting with acid and tartness, yet the caramel malts try to fight through with some spice.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
2039,"2016-08-22",3.9,"750, capped. Wow, thanks so much, C! What an awesome treat. This beer doesnt resemble BdGs as I am familiar with them; its fantastic but seems far outside the style, at least comparing to the ones Ive tried. Who cares, though? If you can get this, get it. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thin, briefly surging light tan head and lots and lots and lots of denatured protein swirling around in the pour. They settles out pretty quickly, and they help stave off hangovers, but theyre there. Bright tangy nose, balsamic and oak and a bit of caramel. Creamy medium body with moderate carb. Balsamic, oak, and caramel mid palate. Came across more like an oude brune than a BdG, but cest la vie.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2039,"2016-08-15",4.2,"Casey being Casey. Another grand slam. Tons of fruit, berry, leather, herb, spices, all funky and balanced. Finish is spices and tartness that linger.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2039,"2016-07-23",3.7,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle dated 04/14/2016. 
Aroma is malty with toasted bread, some light caramel and toffee and a slight nuttiness. Moderate raisin with some light plum and prune. Light citrus and cherry notes. 
Pours brown with a medium large, thick, creamy, tan head that recedes slowly but steadily. Light lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is slightly acidic with a touch of acidity. Moderate malt notes with toasted bread, caramel, toffee and some light nut notes. Light citrus and pineapple. Moderate raisin, prune and plum. Light bitterness and faint oak. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice biere de Garde. Some decent acidity and great malt character. Good fruit notes. Well balanced, but a bit more acidic than I was hoping for.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
2039,"2016-06-23",3.6,"Bottle shared by a friend. Hazy brown pour with a thick beige head. Aroma of malt, caramel, funk and citrus tartness. Malty flavor with slight char and caramel before a sour citrus finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
2039,"2016-04-04",3.6,"Bottle. Brown pour with tan head. Dark malty, nutmeg, weird malty aromas. Flavors are Belgian, fruity, herbal, nutty, yeast and something off.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
2039,"2016-04-04",4.0,"Bottle - pours reddish amber white head - nose and taste of caramel, toffee, oak, nutmeg and vinegar acidity - medium body",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
2039,"2015-12-20",3.8,"Bottle thanks to NEILSEN. Pours clear chestnut, small beige head, decent. Aroma is Brett, oak, toffee, cherry, kind of vinous. Flavor is medium tart, light funk, oaky, dark fruits. Medium body, highish carbonation. Kind of more like a sour red in profile than a Biere de garde. Interesting.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2039,"2015-11-10",4.0,"Bottle thanks to Russell. Pours a hazy brown with small beige head. The aroma is strong oak, toast, dark fruit. Thin mouth, strong oak tannin, fig, light tartness, very nice.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
2039,"2015-10-18",3.8,"Shared bottle. Pours brown with a small beige head. Aroma of fruit, berries, and wood. Taste is tart fruit, berries, wood, spice, and malt. Very nice.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
2039,"2015-08-31",3.8,"Bottle. Pours dark brown white off-white head. Aroma of wild yeasts, wood, bread, nuts, dark fruits, figs. Taste is med-bodied, med- sour, a nice malt to the acidity of the sourness- kind of a fun play on each other. Overall, very nice.","Colorado, USA","Danyel"
2039,"2015-08-21",3.9,"Bottle at home. Pour is deep brown with a small tan head and decent lacing. Big toasted bread notes, somewhat spicy, tangy, red wine, lightly tannic, and dark berries in the aroma. Taste is dark red berries, roasty, bready, raspberry skins, tannins, lots of oak, and spice with a moderately acidic finish. Full mouthfeel with high carbonation. Much more acidic than I am used to for the style. Good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
2039,"2015-08-01",4.7,"Pour at Casey. Dark brown and considerably different than anything he has done. Sour tart on the front end with a big, semi sweet malty backbone that finishes dry. Wow. Just a fantastic supper and absolutely amazing.","Lakewood, Colorado, USA","theothermatt"
