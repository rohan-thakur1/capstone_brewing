A - Pours slightly hazy golden yellow with a nice one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace on the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of musty basement, yogurt, lemon rind, earthy funk, dash of blue cheese and some mild lactic sourness. The drie fonteinen side really shines through in the aroma.


T - Starts off with a lemon yogurt twang quickly being joined by the earthen funk, wet hey, barnyard funk, some aged cheesiness and woody oak tannins. Finish is quite dry, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Crisp, dry feel with a bit of that american twang to it. The feel is pretty much spot on.


O - I had this one on draft about a year ago and it was pretty good but still a little raw. It has really come into its own in the meantime, boding very well for the future.

Taste is pure grapefruit rind, no acetic, low citric, massive leather and lactic. Pure and perfect body. Holy monkey. Sticky tamarind up front blasted by red and white grapefruit with hints of mandarin and tangerine. Sweaty white vinegar and funk nose. Served very cold, need to reassess nose. Interesting savoriness in the nose as it warms. Interesting like tamarind sauce, peach chutney, grilled steak, vanilla. In taste white moldy grapefruit, big zest and spritz. Slight butteriness as it warms, not bad, gives it some depth. Very mild. Great foam actually when poured. Flashes of butter and vinegar, sweet roll. Nose really explodes with amazing white grapefruit acid. Reminds me of some of the best from Cantillon and 3F, like 1998 Cantiloon and Armand&Tommy. Super impressive, best American attempt of a geuze.
>!< slight vinegar and sweat aroma

348,"2014-06-15",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2014 glowing gold, thin white ring. nose very similar to druiven, heavy rind with dank lactic underneath, spritzy lime and true stable reminds immediately of drie fonteinen, Lente/Blauw dusty, a little slick and sharp. Spritzy front is sharp rind, wonderful aged leather and lime early, wheaty dough mid softness the acids, sparkling through the juicy, bitter white grapefruit end, metallic hints, tons of lemons with leather. A little buttery and slick but sparkling and very well ""aged"" despite being young.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
348,"2014-06-15",4.4,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy golden orange with a slight white head. Aromas of lemon, other citrus, slight peach, some hay and slight funk. Taste is puckering sour but very well controlled. This is the amount that I like for this style. The effervescence lifts a bit of sourness off the tongue and the beer cleans up nice. Very very good.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
348,"2014-06-06",4.1,"Pours hazy amber with no head. Aroma and flavor bring beautiful lambic funk, sweet, and tart yeast blended so well with a super dry ending so nice on the tongue.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
348,"2013-09-26",4.2,"From an old style unlabled bottle. Pours orange copper with a rocky white head. Nose is strong citrus, Cantillon like funk, little mineral or earthy notes but a strongly sour, barnyard lemon nose. Flavor is huge citrus, especially lemon seeds, with a sharp sour luck and some aged funky wild yeast. Texture is one of the more impressive things about this--chewy and lush with high carbonation, not as thin as most gueuze. Feels like a couple year old Cxantillon gueuze, which is understandable as the house yeast traces back to that. Next to an 06 Doesjel theres not a lot of nuanced flavors--without the strong woody mushroom funk of Cantillon and without some of the more graceful, mineral like tones of Drie Fonteinen. Still this is very impressive, well developed, mature and genuinely authentic, and Im interested to see how it develops.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
348,"2013-07-28",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2013 Unlabeled bottle, pre release. Drank next to some world class geuze and certainly held its own.

Amber color with beautiful carbonation. Light funk with a suttle fruit note on the nose. 

Taste was very well rounded, nice contrast between funk and fruit. If i didnt know better i would certainly believe this was from belgium. I remember frank saying bull frog would be brewing more traditional belgian lambic and he wasnt kidding. Looks like this is the sign of good things to come","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"
348,"2013-06-25",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2013 Bottle shared with Vin, Frank, Nate, Bill and Dallas. Pours a bright, vibrant orange body with thin white lacing. Aroma is nearly perfect gueuze - funky peaches, juicy tart apricot, lemon and an underlying funk nostalgic of Cantillon or 3Font. Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced and carbonated accuractly per the style; notes of funky citrus fruits, fresh stone fruits, tart lemon and barnyard funk. Specifically reminds me of a cross between Russian River Beatification & Cantillon Gueuze.  Overall, this beer really stood out in a tasting side by side with numerous versions of Cantillon and 3Font, further reiterating the need for a very watchful eye kept out for Nate / Bullfrogs next move.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
348,"2013-06-15",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2014 Pre-release bottle thanks to the Bullfrog guys.  Pale golden-orange, nice clarity, decent sized white head, spotty lacing.  Blend between citric and musty/funk notes.  Lemon, minerality.  Slightly sweaty.  Medium bodied, lively carbonation, assertive acidity, nice finish.  I expect this to improve even more with time as more funk develops and adds additional depth and complexity to this already exceptional American ""gueuze.""","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
348,"2013-06-11",4.2,"Unlabeled 750ml cork and caged bottle of the pre release bottle conditioned Grrrz courtesy of Nate.

Pours a golden orange with a half inch head that dissipates quickly. 

Aroma is lemon, and barnyard funk with a slight mineral tang. Very reminiscent of 3f Oud Gueuze, but not quite as pronounced.

Taste is right in line with the aroma. Funk, citrus, and the flinty minerality I love in a good gueuze. We opened this next to a 2012 Cantillion and 3F oud gueuze and it definitely held its own. Half of our group actually thought it tasted a bit more mature than the other 2.

Carbonation is on point for the style and mouthfeel is excellent. 

Overall: This tastes like gueuze....quality gueuze...and that is as high of a compliment as I can give a beer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","Avalon68"
348,"2013-06-05",3.8,"Nice tartness and acidity, didnt get an extreme funk, some barrel notes, nice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
348,"2013-01-20",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2013 Bottle huge thanks to Frank for cracking this beauty. Shared with Bill, Tim, Jess, Bill, Christine, Barry, Andy, and Frank. Pours a murky vibrant orange with thin watery head, not a whole lot of lacing. Aromas and taste of insanely peachy, and nectarined out gueze, oak, vanilla, barn, and pronounced cantillon sourness. Puckery and mouth watering finish. Made with yeast from Cantillon and 3 Font classic guezes as well as a little bit of kriek. If you were trying this blind you would think it was old and from belgium. So complex and sour. Killer beer from Nate at Bullfrog. Rerate, cracked another at franks in april, straight up peach woody gueze yo. Insanely good.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
