2963,"2016-02-06",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2016 Draft at TH. 1ST rating of this. Another unusual, creative release from this awesome crew. High ABV is well hidden. Red pour and a mild fruity lager aroma. Called a malt liquor but I dont see it. American strong ale is more accurate. Some cherry, prune, dash of lemon, mild hop bitterness in finish. Deceptive, interesting.","USA","Slipstream"
