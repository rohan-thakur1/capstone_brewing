1401,"2016-02-14",3.2,"Tap at Queen City Brewery, Burlington. Colour is clear orange with small white head. Aromas and flavours: Grain, some sweetness, some caramel and malts. Decent and clear.","Oulu/Helsinki, FINLAND","VastActiv"
1401,"2015-12-31",3.7,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a semi-burnt chestnut brown color with a nice transparency about it. A milky to off white colored foamy one finger head quickly dissipated leaving a small cap in the center of the beer. Light lacing clings yet slides into the beer as it went down.
The smell starts off with some roasty nuttiness along with some bready malts. Light toast slides in for the balance.
The taste had a dry sweetness about it. Id say it gets a bit rough in the aftertaste taking the nuts and bready malts a bit further.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body, surprisingly enough, I dont mind a little more ""weight"" than what Im used to seeing for the style. Still, a nice sessionability about it yields a smooth carbonation and proving it can be quite smooth.
Overall, Id say Queen City did what theyre supposed to with this one. Id have again preferably with some food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement onctueuse. Faible effervescence en bouche. Légère présence de caramel en arrière goût. (Rating #6140)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
1401,"2015-01-13",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Polished nut-accented malts brush spicy hops before earthy bitterness seals this svelte Dunkel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the copper shine.
-This is completely süffig, as it should be.
-Malts and hops are both nicely defined and harmonious.
-Caramelized cereals are deep enough to offer more than mild sweetness.

On tap at the brewery.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
