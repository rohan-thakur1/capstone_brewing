Pale reddish body. Very small white head. Settles to nothing.

Quite a complex nose. I guess thats grape. Very fruity. Oaky. Lightly lemony. Yogurt. 

Flavor has lots of berry fruit. Sour. Yogurty lactic sour. A little lemony, but then it gets really overwhelmed by oak.

4428,"2015-12-31",4.2,"75CL Bottle acquired in a trade. Bottled 7/22/2013 and its bottle 120 of 353. I think I gave up a 37.5CL Blabaer for this bottle shortly after release. Split 3 ways at fridge temp. Bottle stored upright for many months. 

A - Gorgeous color. Pink reddish color a 1 finger head that fades to a think ring. It looks absolutely gorgeous. 

S - it smells pretty darn good. Distinct Saint Lamvinus aroma. Grapes, cheese, funk, a hint of metallic with wine barrel. Really smells amazing. 

T - Taste is juicy, sweet, a ton of wine barrel. Really juicy like straight up grape must, raspberry juice and apples. Chalky and covers the teeth with sour candies but the barrel notes and berry is awesome. Theres a bit of copper penny and mold flavor

M - This is far more dense than traditional lambic and the beer doesnt have a blended taste to it and carbonation is very light.

O - So final thoughts? Well, I drink a lot o fruit lambic and this is a dense, overly acidic acid bomb with out the refinements of a Kriek, Merlot, Framboise lambic. . However, for an american sour, its really really really great.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Ridiculous aroma thats bursting with juicy vinous fruit and a strong red wine barrel presence. Nice toasted oak tannins and subtle vanilla along with very prominent sweet red wine notes. Juicy grapes, sour cherry, strawberry and other dark berries countered by sweaty, earthy funk and musty farmhouse yeast. Plenty of earthy barnyard bugs/wild yeast balancing out the sweeter notes. One of the best smelling beers Ive come across. 

Sour and puckering with nice acidity but not harsh at all and no acetone/solvency to speak of. Tart yet very refreshing with a strong vinous red wine presence countering the funky bugs and acidic sourness. Dry oaky tannins and vanilla bean followed by strong red wine flavor, grapes, sour cherry, and strawberry and cream. Almost a perfect combination of funky bugs, acidic sourness, oak tannins and sweet red wine notes. Slightly minerally in the finish . Complex, delicious and very easy to drink.

4428,"2014-06-21",4.1,"75cl, no mention of ABV, new exclusive American brew Anno 2013, with Merlot grapes, thx alot to Geoff!, very complex sour fruit brew, sour/fruity and slightly vinous/woody, very balanced, hazy, small head, top class!, Can stand next to the best fruit lambics from Belgium!","Gent, BELGIUM","BoBoChamp"
4428,"2014-06-15",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2015 Tap at Standard. Glowing red body, active puffy white head froths more than any Ive seen, undulating as it dies quickly like the swirling ocean in Tarkovskys Solaris. I sit mesmerized. Nose is pure Belgian lambic, stable and rind all over, creek water, softly lactic and balanced with all elements coexisting. Grapes emerge at front palate, peppery and juicy, lightly stinging and puckeringly dry, sweetness building mid alongside acids through the sticky, earthy finish where the rind re-emerges, tongue curled in sourness. A slight olive note wont blow off with time in the incredibly long grape skin finish. This is drie fonteinen level lambic. The carbonation and abv are dialed down enough to let the grapes breathe, which were Malvasias errors. Phenols are ultra clean, no rubbery Cantillon messes like Kriek, aged Lamvinus or even LPs. Druiven is at Pinot DAunis level integration. A masterpiece of Belgian lambic and its American.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
4428,"2014-05-30",4.3,"Draft at Eulogy durong a Bullfrog event. Hazy red sandalwood pour with a nice white head. Tart raspberry. Kaffir lime leaves. Celery root. Lots of drying oak tannins. Raspberry flavors win out. Strong carbonation. Medium body. Well crafted. All the right notes are in place. A wonderful raspberry lambic.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"
4428,"2014-03-20",4.1,"Thanks Frank. Dark raspberry red colored body, small off-white head, spotty lacing. Notes of sour cherries, must, funk, oak, vinous grapes, lactic notes. Medium bodied, lively carbonation, assertive acidity, nice finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
4428,"2013-11-06",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2013 Served on-tap at the Et Tu Brut release a few weeks back.


A - Pours deep dark red, bordering on brownish, with a small half finger tall white head, dissipating down to some foam around the edge of the glass, leaving very small trails of lace down parts of the glass.


S - Smells of vinous Merlot grapes, good amount of woody oak, mild funk and must and some earthy minerals. Not a ton going on at the moment, the grapes and wood are really strong right now.


T - Starts off just like the nose with a strong mix of merlot grapes and woody oak tannins slowly giving way to hints of barnyard funk, basement must, earthy minerals and some mild lactic sourness. Finish is pretty dry thanks to those oak tannins, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate to low carbonation. Feel is pretty vinous and dry but that should improve once the yeast really gets going.


O - This is probably my least favorite of the three, but they are all good. I think this one will need some extra time to really develop but once it does it is going to be awesome.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
4428,"2013-08-17",4.5,"Bottle cracked by Frank, pours hazy cranberry, with light head. Aromas and taste of vtg wood, barn, apricot skins, tart cherries, merlot skinnage, and funk. Medium body, puckery as fuck. Only real lambic style producer in America. Retarded.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4428,"2013-08-17",4.6,"Bottle courtesy of Frank shared with Frank and Vinny. Pours the most beautiful vibrant red body with light white lacing. Aroma is nearly perfect - sweet sour cherries, aggressive funk, and beautiful tart character. Mouthfeel is active carbonation with notes of sour cherries, sour tart gushers, sour patch kids, basement funk and lime. Incredible gueuze, cheers Nate.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
