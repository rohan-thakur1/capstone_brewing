3925,"2016-08-07",4.8,"750 ml. bottle sampled @ Epic beer Tasting 2016. Deep bright blackberry juice red, head is very fried. Nose is massive lactic berry, sour fizzy, blackberry is massive, insane, going to pomegranate. Taste is massive fizzy fruit, extreme blackberry, lactic, crazily big fruit, very lively, light grape skins, dry red wine, & pomegranate. Crazy stuff, these dark berry De Garde Bu beers are something special all right.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
3925,"2016-08-07",3.9,"Huge fluffy pink head over garnet-cyclamen beer. Sour fruity nose, with red fruit and a bit of lactic acid. Sour fruit returning in the mouth, without excess acidity - very good impression. But the aftertaste yields puckering sourishness and a lot of acidthinning in the mouthfeel. Just a tad too acidic but still very nice.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
3925,"2016-03-31",4.1,"On tap at the brewery. Pours ruby red with some purple-white foam. Aroma is berries, light wood. Taste is sour (7/10) and acidic with lots of berry flavor; some wood and vanilla; has a nice tannic dryness. Fine soft cacarbonation. Great stuff.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
3925,"2016-02-08",3.6,"July 18, 2015. Bottle at Quebec tasting, thanks for sharing!
Cloudy red with a small frothy off-white/pinkish head. Aroma is tart juicy blackberries, some lemon, yoghurt, hints of grape skins, slight vegetal. Taste is quite acidic, with a very light berry sweetness leading to a very dry acidic finish with blackberry notes,berry skin, lemon juice, yoghurt and some vegetal notes. Light to medium bodied, quite fizzy carbonation.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hackobock"
3925,"2015-09-18",3.9,"Bottle; Pour is murky, turbid, purple drank - spirtzy carbonation that fades fast here. The nose is lemon zest, bready malt notes - with dark fruit character presenting itself nicely. Not quite blackberry - but im not complaining. The flavor profile takes it to a much better place - its sweet tart, vinous - moving to more lemon - berry skin and juice - theres a lingering bitter here - its yet another terrific ride from de garde.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
3925,"2015-08-13",4.1,"Murky pinkish purple like blackberry juice. Amazing blackberry aroma with sticky fruit tones and a little sour twang. Sweet blueberry and very light sour twanginess, a little lemony acidity, and a tart finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3925,"2015-07-27",3.4,"How: Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. From kcherney, thanks! 

>>> An average Berliner Weisse with a very nice blackberry fruitiness but subpar on every other aspects. 

+  Burst of blackberries / blackberry jam at first, which was very nice 
−  Like most De Garde beers, the appearance isnt a selling point. Hazy purple-ish red with a bubbly pinkish head. 
−  The acidity is borderline over the top and theres nothing to balance it 
−  Theres the usual De Garde rotten-something presence 
−  A bit thin, even for a Berliner Weisse and the barrel-aged treatment isnt adding much complexity

Flavors:  Blackberry jam, yogurt, sangria, vegetal notes, lemon","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3925,"2015-07-23",2.8,"Bottle 750ml.
Pours hazy/muddy pinky with low to no head. Aroma is of fruits, yogurt, strawberries, blackberries. Taste is of jam, acid, not much else. Palate: Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Overall: Way too acid. Not drinkable.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
3925,"2015-07-22",3.6,"Pours a murky pink with a small rim that leaves low lacing. Nose is of blackberries and acid. Taste is moderately acid, fruity and juicy. Acidity level is a lot more reasonable than your usual De Garde, really. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate and I found it to be really refreshing. Overall a pretty good fruited berliner, I wouldnt let it age much longer though.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3925,"2015-07-20",3.4,"Reddish Pink. 3 finger head appears and fades slowly to 1 finger.hazy due to many pours but was probably beautiful before. it smells like blackberries with tart. like a cobbler. Thats very sour! Like a blackberry juice with a sour juice of some wort. more mouthfeel than the base BUs but unique. probably wouldnt seek out","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Flavour is along the same lines, with super fruity, pithy blackberries, medium tartness and light oak. Not the most complex of the Bus, but very well-incorporated.

3925,"2015-06-03",4.1,"750mL bottle pours with a sludgy looking opaque cherry juice throw-up sort of thing (but in the best possible way) and topped with a dark pink head of foam. The aroma offers up spikes of tartness, berry must tartness, some sweet berry odors and then faint funkiness. The taste delivers plenty of punchy sensations with a nice thick berry juice sweetness undercut by berry and other various tart notes. These flavors tug the experience in opposite directions but somehow maintain a tasty harmony that beckons further sips. Solid Berliner.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
