2074,"2016-10-09",3.7,"On draft at Roll Out the Barrel 2016. The pour is a darker red brown with s thin cap of white head and no lace. The aroma is sour and vinous with a nice grape and bright fruit offering. There is a light tartness and a moderate sour presence. No real barnyard, but its decently crisp and light. The flavor is definitely funky. There is a light grape sour happening, but there is a sweet maltiness to it as well. The port adds a nice woodiness on the back end. The mouth feel is thin and light with a watery thin carbonation and a less than desirable finish. Meh.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

2074,"2016-10-09",3.3,"Draft to taster at the Eccentric Cafe. Looks solid; a cloudy caramelish orange with foamy off-white head. Smells semi-sweet, tart, and mildly funky alongside notes of port and oak. Tastes like it smells, but less balanced, with a medium-bodied mouthfeel that finishes semi-dry. Solid, but smells better than it tastes.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
