Basically, a palette of roasted malt flavors ranging from bitter to sweet creamy intertwined with pine and peppery hops.

1490,"2015-11-17",3.7,"330 ml bottle from Gallaghers Beer World/El Irlandés. Pours a murky, viscous black color with a big gray-ish tan head that lasts long and leaves a lingering 1/2 finger cap. Poweful and intense aroma felt even before sniffing. Roasted malts mixed up with lively hoppy hints and some charcoal character. Notes of bitter chocolate, cacao, tar, tabacco leaves, ashes, roasted grains, prunes, lactose and molasses. Potent woody and vanilla touches round up a massive aroma. Incredible nose! -- Strong sweet taste, and Im drinking this cold. No bitterness at all with just mild roastiness offered as a counterbalance. Flavors of brown sugar, whisky cream, molasses, beetroot, stevia, chocolate liquor in an all-sweet assault. Touches of coffee and hot chocolate with sweetened cocoa. Extreme but maybe too sweet to be really good. Difficult to finish the whole bottle. Later sips become cloying. Oh! just give me a good Pilsener now! Huge body, chewy mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy. Light carbonation. No clear alcoholic presence but this warms you up a lot. Aftertaste reveals some hops but most of them appear through retronasal. Overall this is a massive Imperial Porter, huge complex smell, gigantic body, intense taste... but too sweet for me. Too bad Brian Nielsen never defeated Evander Holyfield or Mike Tyson.

Aroma is marvellus: rich, malty, with coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate and with slightly burnt like character, with note of molasses, and with fruity esters of reisins, prunes. 
Flavor is also very intense, malty, with fruity esters and with bitterness: intense maltiness with coffee, dark chocolate like character, with intense note of fruity esters (plums, cherries, prunes), with slightly burnt grain, supporting molasses, and with surprisingly high hop bitterness in finish. Finish is, as I said, bitter, sticky/dry.
