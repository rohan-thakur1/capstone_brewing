It pours deep and dark with a small foamy tan head. Smells of raisins, sweet malt, and toffee. Taste is light roast with some milkiness, caramel, and some smoky malt on the finish. Its a little light-bodied, but smooth and well-carbonated. This is a fine beer, and one that Id love to have next time I make it out to the Troll.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

Grumpy Troll Spetsnaz is a brownish black beer with a thin film of a coffee colored head that has some pretty nice lacing.  It has a nutty and roasty aroma thats a touch sweet and quite pleasing.  Its pretty full bodied and very smooth.  The finish is very dry.  It has a mellow roasted flavor.  Its well balanced and very flavorful.  Coffee seems to be the strongest note here.

The beer appeared opaque and thick, with a medium amount of head.  Aroma was a bit chocolatey, and offered a ton of dry roastiness.  Flavor and mouthfeel was terrific, and as Ive described above.

I thought this beer alone was worth the trip to Mount Horeb.

1973,"2007-06-23",3.6,"On tap at brewpub
My palate was beginning to get a bit tired so this made a nice change of pace.  They advertise it as an imperial stout but it is definitely not; if anything it falls more under the heading of an export stout.  There is also a barrel aged version available which I did not get a chance to try on this visit in May.
Aroma / Appearance - Without being extremely dark it was still a dark and mysterious color.  The body swirled effortlessly around the glass leaving no lacing or discoloration.  Coffee, hazel creamer, wood smoke and malt form the first wave.  This is followed by anise, pepper and dark chocolate.  There is alot going on within the confines of the sampler glass.
Flavor / Palate - The first impression is a little thin but the flavors are unaffected.  Strong black coffee, almonds, smoke, peanut butter and burnt malts make their way down the throat leaving behind evidence at every sip.  The only flaw is that it gets a little overpowering at the end - for that I have to knock it down a point or two.  Otherwise this is a well made beer no matter what you call it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1973,"2007-05-21",4.0,"Dark brown/black body with a white head.  The flavor is roasty with lots of anise and lactose.  Charred malt and lots of black patent stand out.  The aroma is lactose and black malt with that distinct foreign stout quality.  Roasty charred palate.  Coffee and chocolate are also noticeable.  A delightful Foreign Stout.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
