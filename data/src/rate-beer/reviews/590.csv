590,"2016-12-21",4.0,"La Gauloise Christmas est une véritable bière de Noël, qui ne rentre pas dans la catégorie des bières exceptionnelles, mais qui sait égayer une froide soirée dhiver. Véritable bière de Noël car elle répond aux codes qui, à mon sens, doivent être respectées pour ce style : une présence suave et chaleureuse en bouche qui demande pour le dernier point un degré minimum dalcool (8 % Abv apparaît être un seuil en dessous duquel il devient plus compliqué dobtenir cette sensation de chaleur procurée par lalcool), et une recette intégrant des épices ou autres ingrédients permettant à des arômes corsés de sexprimer. Force est de constater que les bières brunes permettent plus facilement de respecter ces critères afin dobtenir une boisson festive. Notre Gauloise Christmas confirme cette règle avec une robe brune limpide (EBC de 72) surmontée dune mousse beige et crémeuse, abondante, de 5 cm dépaisseur mais retombant par la suite. Les épices présents dans la recette : Coriandre et réglisse. Le nez est classique dune double avec des arômes de céréales, pruneaux, café avec néanmoins une touche de coriandre et de girofle. Lattaque est corsée, sur les céréales, lorange et la girofle : excellente entrée en matière ! Lamertume qui sen suit est dintensité moyenne (EBU 22) mais poussée par un alcool bien présent. Les arômes de pruneaux sont les plus prégnants avec un arrière bouche déclinant des notes de cerises et une pointe chocolatée. La densité de larrière bouche manque toutefois légèrement dintensité pour une bière de Noël. Léquilibre est cependant globalement bien trouvée. Le final est quant à lui relativement décevant, présentant des notes épicées mais dune intensité et dune longueur insuffisante. Il manque donc quelques guirlandes au sapin pour un Noël inoubliable, mais nous sommes déjà dans lambiance des fêtes!","FRANCE","jybi"

590,"2013-10-08",4.4,"Une bière de Noël  Toujours une grande attente  et une inquiétude sur le résultat 
Bref, on sait que lon a devant soi une bière spéciale, mais sera-ce dans le bon sens ?
Ici, je dirais : mi-figue, mi-raisin... Ce qui est déjà difficile pour la bière, mais on va 
essayer de sexpliquer 
Affichée à 8,1 % abv, cest bien, mais on ne va pas crier pour une Christmas !
Bouchonnée de liège, et bouchon numéroté : très bien.
Etiquette au père Noël on ne peut plus classique : bof !
Couleur brun foncé, quasi noir, même en transparence : bien pour le genre.
Clarté nette : bien
Bulles fines à moyennes, très nombreuses : très bien.
Mousse beige, fine, très crémeuse, qui vient caler à 5 ou 6 mm : très bien.
Arômes de café, chocolat noir, pruneau et une pointe de girofle : sympa.
Texture assez structurée : on aurait préférer soyeuse (pour le genre).
1ère bouche avec une nuance danis étoilé mise en avant, assez fine, sur une saveur café.
Arrière-bouche assez fraîche (trop?) pour une Christmas, mais bien présente.
2ème bouche avec des épluchures de pomme de terre (on ne comprend pas ), avec de la
menthe et de lanis très délicat.
3ème bouche toujours fraîche, mais avec sa touche exotique.
Arrière-bouche bien faite et assez longue.
La longueur par contre napporte pas beaucoup de nuances en plus, en tout cas pas assez, 
selon moi. Elle est certes progressive, mais on a le volume requis avec une bouteille de 75 cl,
et il faut toujours se méfier avec ce genre de bouteille !!!
La levure est une veine classique de brune double.
Lalcool soutient bien la bière mais na pas de complexité à travailler.
La finale se déroule sur une ambiance un peu rétro dune brune double de bon aloi qui serait
la parente dune cousine exotique sur le café et lanis. Bref, on est entre deux eaux et on ne sait
se fixer.
Conclusion : le problème de cette bière est dêtre restée sur une double, alors quune christmas
devrait passer à une quadruple (ou à tout le moins être une double à très fort caractère).
Ici ni le degré dalcool ni la complexité ne lont permis, mais elle reste une très honnête double.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

The expected dried dark fruits are in place, so is the caramel. But there is also a nice yeasty touch, strawberry candy, burnt sugar, dark candi sugar, spices, faint chocolate and even some refreshing hoppy notes far in the back. The taste is very sweet and the finish is not that bitter, but still this works, even if I suspect that many  will find this too sweet. The strong flavours follow the aroma.

590,"2011-06-06",3.4,"In short: A sweet, fruity and chocolaty strange beer with a hard-liquor character.  Decent.
How: Bottle 330ml.  Exact age unknown.  I would guess between 1 and 2 year of age
The look: Cloudy brown body topped by a large rocky beige head with good retention
In long: Nose is a mix between a fruity alcohol (sherry, port wine) and chocolate fudge.  Taste is boozy, liquorish, red fruits (berries and cherries), chocolate fudge, toasted whole wheat bread, birch bark, spiciness in the finish.  Very sweet, boozy and too much of a hard liquor sensation for me.  Carbonation is a lot of small soft bubbles and the body is creamy.  This is a sipper that would work well as spicy meal dessert beer, but it is not something that was really enjoyable for my fresh taste buds as my only beer of the night.

590,"2010-06-03",3.0,"33 cl bottle from Bieropholie, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. BB 23/09/10. 
App.:  Very deep brown-mahogany with a decent fluffy light tan foam.
  
Aroma:  Very rich, malty and SWEET with great gooey gobs of brown sugar, molasses, rich dark dried fruits stewed together, orange peel, some warm spices, an odd candle wax note (second beer with this...maybe my nose is defective), some cherries, dried glaceed fruits, a touch of brightness; a very festive Dubbel.
  
Palate:  Medium-full body, big, round effervescence that causes my cheeks to puff out.
  
Flav.:  Follows the nose with more gooey, dripping sweet malts, fruitiness, molasses and brown sugar, a fair bit of orange-citrus zip, that odd waxy note, some spices, so sweet and sticky; intensely sweet with nice rich malts and some warming alcohol in the finish.

590,"2010-05-31",2.6,"Pours a near-black body with a dense, pillowy off white head. Nose is immediate and intense; raisins, succade and candy sugar, with hints of port wine. Very Christmasy aromas floating around, and the taste backs up the promise: initial palate is smooth and filled with raisins and licorice. Hints of cinnamon and/or cardamom, cant really tell which is most to the front. Candy sugar coming towards the end, and vague, dry hop notes back up the finish. Complex stuff. Bocq Christmas is a tad bit sweet - even for a Christmas brew - particularly the licorice notes which sometimes waver into the land of succade and straight molasses. Alcohol is well hidden, with a warming feeling that comes gradually. A plus for the extremely seasonal feel, a minus for the relatively low drinkability, a result of both the overwhelming sweetness and the complexity of seasonal spice. As the bottle becomes empty my faint nausea grows, and I am forced to conclude that this is far too sweet for me.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

590,"2010-05-09",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Cherry liqueur, chocolate malt and bready yeast are propelled by expansive effervescence in this pleasant Belgian Strong Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the dark brown with reddish highlights.
-The finish is rather shortlived.
-This might be a tad rough around the edges, yet it remains a most satisfying Kerstbier.
-Spicy hops are relatively tame in the finish.

Deep, ruby red in body (black off the light). Head surged up the glass and stabilised a dense, rocky beige and a good inch and a half thick. Clung firmly to the sides frosting over three quarters of the glass as I sipped.   Mixture of berries, stone-fruits and Black sambuca in the aroma. Lightly zesty with a pleasant tickle of aniseed and alcohol.   Prickly on the front of the tongue; sweet, vinous and very smooth through into the swallow. Strong flavours of plums, blackberries and a tang of cranberries; drying dark malts and a light balancing touch of liquorice, burnt wood and peppery spice. Fills the mouth well; very tight in flavour on the palate with a woody, dry and warming finish that only shows a little of the huge alcohol.   Another well-crafted and seamless brew from Du Bocq.

Re-rate dec 27, 2006:
Apparently, I had forgotten Id already rated this one. Ah well, re-rates can be quite interesting too. Here goes:

Bottled 2006.

Beautiful, hazy copper color, with small, bubby beige head. Some yeast sediment in bottom of bottle.
Dryish aroma of molasses, yeast, and hops, with a hint of alcohol sweetness.
Ditto for flavor, albeit somewhat sweeter than aroma. Bitterish aftertaste.
Medium body, clean mouthfeel, rather heavy carbonation.

590,"2004-04-07",3.8,"(I deliberatly choose a very well-aged sample - well from the Du Bocq period, of course. This kind of beer usually benefits from it). Nearly red amber, slight yeast specks; virtually no head. Sweet caramel & portwine nose, fruity. Taste of good vintage port, fruity, slightly nutty. No noxious oxydation. Sweetness just in check, vinous. Mellow, alcoholic mouthfeel, like a vintage fortified wine again. Not really overly heavy-bodied. Excellent vinous beer. I might have been prejudiced about the age factor, IMO I was vindicated by the result. I can only recommend opening this only quite aged - with possible spectacular results. From memory, the younger versions are way too sweet, with an unpleasant scorched bitterness.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
590,"2004-03-13",4.0,"Yeasty, malty-sweetish and fruity aroma with some hints of pepper or other spices. Quite decent. Cloudy, dark brown coloured with a thin, lasting and off-white head. Yeasty, sweetish-roasted malty taste (toffee) with some spices (pepper again?) and fruits (grapefruit). More bitter in the middle and in the finish. Dry and bitterness in the end. Very decent brew.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
590,"2004-02-02",3.5,"A nice dark-red hue with a big, foamy tan head.  It has a sweet spicy (coriander), yeasty aroma that is very pleasant.  Somewhat metallic aftertaste. The mouthfeel is moderate at best with a good malty middle.  Chimay-like flavor.  Nice but the finish is a little off.","Valley Center, California, USA","SG"
590,"2004-01-14",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2008 Jan, 2004  Bottle Conditioned. From Bottles, London. BBE Nov 04.  Dark reddish brown with big head. Yeast, underarm, black pepper aroma. Malty. Some sweetness. Surprisingly thinnish body for strength. Pepper in flavour. Yeast. Acceptable, but not that interesting. [2.8]
Jan, 2008 Draught at Delirium, Brussels. Hmm - go to the bar with the worlds biggest selection of beers, and end up buying a beer Ive had before!  Alcohol, sherry, Christmas cake.

590,"2003-12-31",3.4,"The best thing about this beer was the wonderful appearance and the inviting aroma.  It lost alot in the other catagories.  Aroma was nice,with hints of yeast malt and toffee.  Appearance was very good with a large creamy tan head on a ruby / mahogany beer.  Flavor was balanced but uninspired.  yes malt, sweetness in initial and dry at the finish.  Not bad but there are better out there.  Keep looking.","Cordova, Tennessee, USA","kumite56"

590,"2003-11-23",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2009 (Bottled, 0.75l) Hazy orangeish brown color with medium, beige head. Quite spicy, fruity and bitter-hoppy aroma with toffee hints. Sweetish-malty, nicely spicy, toffee flavor with a strong anise finish. Smooth, medium to full-bodied, slightly sugary-sticky and wineous, quite bitter palate with some alcohol and foamy carbonation. A very enjoyable, full-bodied and spicy Belgian christmas ale - like a mixture of Orval and Westmalle Dubbel. Tastes great even at room temp. (0.33l bottle) Quite sweet, no Orval sourness, simpler than a big bottle. Would score 3.7.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
590,"2003-04-22",3.4,"Bottle-conditioned, Best before end 1999. Cloudy brown color, no head, probably because of its age. Extremely alcoholic nose, wine-like. Sweet taste, very alcoholic, quite complex. Spicy, malty, all together. Not a starter though.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
590,"2003-04-20",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2011 Re-rate: Bottled, Regal X-Mas, from my parents cellar, approx. 8 years old. Very dark brown colored, small brown head. Very strong malty nose, lots of chocolate, fruit, caramel, impressive. Flavor has lots of liquorice, in between sweet and bitter, balanced. Very thick mouthfeel. Im impressed, this kind of complexity is almost exclusively found at ABVs above 10%. Still, i have no clue what a fresh version would taste like.
Previous rating (3.8):19-04-2003 (BB 09-1999). Dark brown, no head. Malty, port-like aroma with some liquorice. Strong port-like flavour, like an aged (>5 years) Chimay Bleu. Not as balanced though. Not an everyday beer, but very nice on occasion.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"

Lovely mouthfeel with with lots of fluffiness, which is yielded by a wonderful job of the bottle conditioning.  Huge malt notes of crystal and a trace of peatiness.  Very unique and delicious flavors compliment the sweet malts ingeniously with spruce, juicy fruit gum, herbal traits, and pepper.  Long malty finish with a perfect touch of numbing spice.  Very Christmasy and just what I was seeking in this spicy Bruin style.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
