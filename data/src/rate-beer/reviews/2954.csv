2954,"2016-03-19",3.5,"I finally get to try the epic, legendary, whispered about malt liquor. Poured up on tap at the Flavor Bistro during RBWG16 where it exhibits a mahogany colored body that supports a lasting tan head of foam. The aroma offers up sweet malts blended with roasted malts and a biscuit malt character. The taste is sugary sweet with malts before getting into a thin dark roasted maltiness and a light sense of sweet nuttiness. As it warmed a bit I got a sliver of burnt malts and faint lagery fruity esters coming to the surface.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2954,"2010-03-02",4.2,"Three year old aged Toast on tap. Ive never had this beer fresh, so I cant give a good comparison. On that topic, I would love to cure that error in my experiences. I found this aged version to be delicate and complex. The caramel malt flavor is sublime, incredible bready notes, lightly toasted (of course), mix with lingering floral hops. The feel was silky smooth and light. The beer was relatively light in color with a good head and lacing. I tried to let it warm up a bit because it was served colder than I would have preferred. It really just had one of the most tantalizing and light sweet flavor profiles that Ive ever tasted. Excellent beer that I will be on the lookout for from now on.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

It is more like a cross between a good, earthy, caramelly English ESB and a &quotred&quot American strong ale like Bear Republic Red Rocket.  It is deep, clear copper with a medium, dense, lon-lasting head that leaves rich lacing, typical of Moonlight.  The aroma is earthy, caramel, dark toast, with fruity-piney hops.  The taste is rich and intricate, beuatifull balanced between sweetness and bitternes, full-bodied, with dark but not burnt toast, caramel, earthy hints, fruit, hitns of citrus, flowers, and pine.  It starts of a little sweeter and finishes a little more bitter but has beautiful balance all the way through,  Its thick and smooth but also lively.","California, USA","Wulfstan"
