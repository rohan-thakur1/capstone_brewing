The nose is funky....with a good dose of barnyard funk, hay, acetic notes and juicy fruits. The mid palate is sweet, toasty and fruity with light funky notes and light bitterness.

813,"2013-12-01",4.5,"Je termine actuellement ma dernière 6e soir vieillie depuis plus dun an et demie. Coment ai-je pu conserver aussi longtemps une bière aussi magnifique? Je ne saurais répondre. Cette bière, une fois vieillie, propose au nez des parfums complexes de pêche, dalcool et de fleurs des champs. Bref, beaucoup de chaleur émane de mon sniffer. À loeil elle est dun doré imposant qui lui confère immédiatement son label impériale.
En hommage à mon service délicat et attentionné, la 6e soir simpose avec une prometteuse mousse blanche cependant qui colle peu aux paroies du verre et qui dispartaît étonnament en quelques minutes. Surprise.
En bouche leffervescence est forte mais de courte durée; semblable à une triple mais dont on retient bien plus les parfums sucrés que lamertume. Lalcool est chaud et le fruit, qui se le dispute entre le noyau de pêche et le zeste de pamplemousse ne cesse détonner au fur et à mesure que lon tient le liquide en bouche.
La 6e soir est une bière de la série Momentum du Dieu Du Ciel qui aura à notre grand désarrois, amateurs et contemplateurs de fabulosités, sauté une année.

En fait, mon absence détonnement réside surtout dans le fait que jai trouvé cette bière excellente, comme les autres bières de la même brasserie.

The aftertaste leaves a nice tingle on the tongue and the high alcohol content is well hidden. I am not tasting some of the complexity that others are though. It is very pleasant and smooth but for me lacks the complexity to give it top marks. It is mostly a contrast between the initial heavy malt flavour and a delicate bitter aftertaste.

Taste: Delicacy and finesse would be the words to describe the attack, with notes of caramel, cherry and blackcurrant. Very malty attack. This would be the perfect example of a full creamy body.

In long: Nose is like smelling a hay stack.  A whole lot of malt in this one.  Crunchy honeyed cereals abound.  Sweetness is rather well balanced by a hefty amount of slightly spicy grassy hops with a light tree bark character.  I still dont think an Imperial Pilsner is a great idea but this one is the exception to the rule.  Unlike most Imperial Pilsner this one remains as highly drinkable as an excellent regular pilsner except that its bigger and more intense.

Bright, cloudy orange-gold, thick white head of moderate duration...lightly fruity/malty nose, melon and dry grass...big malty flavors, light alcohol, sweet and a bit syrupy, grainy and with strange hints of licorice, herbal/grassy hops subdued to the rather thick mouthfeel which dries out considerably at the finish.

813,"2005-06-07",4.2,"On draught at the brewpub and at the fest, June 2005.  Light, yet brilliant goldenrod and straw colored beer, slight chill haze, but mostly clear, with a moderate white head, decent retention, low lacing.  Aroma of grassy, rustic, floral, herbal, citrus and spicy hops.  Everything but the bathroom sink, as far as the hops profile, it seems.  Notes of sweet pils malt, but mainly just the juicy fruits.  Flavor is full of hops, more flavor than bitterness, but still plenty of bitterness.  Juicy fruits from the nose, grapefruit, minty/herbal hops, green grassy hops.  Malt provides a backbone, of sweet honey and light doughiness, but does not have that syrupy, hugely sweet thickness that other Imperial Pilseners have.  And when the hops are done this well, thats a good thing.  Some of the most flavorful hops belches Ive encountered.  FInish is moderately bitter, lightly spicy and fairly sweet, with a medium body.  I didnt find any alcohol.  Carbonation was relatively low for the style, and the mouthfeel was slick and bordering creamy at points, though there is some thinning of body on the end.  Could stand a little more crisp yeast in the nose too.  I really like J.F.s pilseners.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
