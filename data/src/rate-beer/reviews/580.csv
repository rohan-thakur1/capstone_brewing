580,"2015-03-19",3.6,"draft, as a self-proclaimed dubbel aficionado, this is a good attempt, above average for the american verison but no westy 8, or chimay red at all. Different leagues. This is still characteristically nutty and caramel with a touch of dry smoke on thie finish which i enjoyed.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"

580,"2014-08-20",2.8,"Ive never been a fan of American-made dubbels and this is just another case of why. The belgian yeast character is completely missing and finishes too dry for my liking. I dont know where these people are getting sweet from but it definitely leaned towards bitter for me.  Doesnt smell like a dubbel either.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
580,"2014-04-19",4.3,"Like this one a lot. A bit sweeter than the style typically demands, but it works well here. Would love to see a quad from these guys.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"

580,"2013-11-07",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Pours dark, clear, mahogany with a light head that dissipates quickly. Light raisin, dates, and burnt sugar on the nose. The taste features a moderate plum tone, some brown sugar, light cinnamon, and dry clove and light bitter hops on the finish. Roasted malt takes over as the beer warms and is accompanied by a slight booziness. Solid dubbel.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

580,"2013-11-03",3.8,"Poured up on tap at Wilderness where it has a very nice looking deep crystal clear ruby red body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma is sweet with prunes and smooth figs and then lighter vaguely hoppy notes cut into the sweetness near the end of the draw. The taste has rich flavors of prunes, figs and a bit of brown sugar. It does maintain a slight tartness and hop bitterness to attempt to balance off the heavier sweeter notes. Toward the finish some roasted malts take over along with a sliver of nuttiness and create a nice balance against the sweetness into the finish. I enjoyed the degree of roastiness presented here.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

580,"2013-10-29",4.2,"Dark red pour, aroma from yeast is subtle which I like. Slight figgy, prune taste, but nothing over powering. Admittedly these belgian styles are not my favorite, but I could definitely drink this again.

580,"2013-10-29",4.6,"Well this is an incredible a ample of the style. Pours a nice brown color with a perfectly sized light head. Aroma has some nutty and sweet scents but it certainly doesnt smell sweet. And the flavor is spot on. Dates, figs, light brown sugar, some dark bread, and the finish is dry and beautiful.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
580,"2013-10-24",4.2,"Growler pours a reddish brown with a medium sized tan head. Aroma of spices, candi sugar, figs, belgian yeasts, bananas and cherries. Taste is spices, banana, candi-sugar, hops, dark malts, esthers and yeasts. Most dubbels are pretty sweet, this one walks the line between sweet and dry..... and I really appreciate how its not too cloying like most are. Really nice beer.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
