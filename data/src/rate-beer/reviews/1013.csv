The nose shows light acetic tones with light caramel and latte notes over restrained black coffee. Vanilla and bourbon notes become apparent upon opening up.

An alcoholic prickly heat appears on the mid-palate followed by a lot of vanilla and lightly roasted coffee bitterness on the finish.

Was lucky enough to get a free pour while going to Emilys birthday party. A huge thanks to Chris and Lesley for probably a huge tab. Rushed this, but heres to heaven.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head when I got it. Very serene setting underneath the chaos. Excellent spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled smooth buttery bourbon, milk chocolate syrup, cocoa, some malt chocolate, creamy espresso, vanilla, toffee and sweet caramel. (Smell - 4.75)

Just as awesome as I hoped it would be. So glad I got the chance to have it. Unfortunately I feel like I slightly overrated it a tad. (Overall - 4.75)

A bit more sweet and vanilla from the Vietnamese coffee, and a thinner body than the non-BA Speedies. The bourbon is almost overwhelming with its taste and heat but somehow backs off just enough to showcase all the other flavours.

The aroma is a huge chocolate bomb. Its awesome. There is such a big chocolate malt presence. There is a strong barrel character as well. The bourbon is big and it does offer a nice addition of vanilla. The coffee is quite subdued, which Im not that much of a fan of. The flavor is good, but lightly disappointing. The coffee again is lacking. The chocolate is big once more and the bourbon is nice. There is a strong woodiness to it that I just dont care too much for. The head and chocolate balance well though. The mouth feel is a little light. Its viscous, but you have to work the carbonation out and Im not crazy about that. This one is good, but its not quite as good as some of the other BA variants.

Aromas are bold with coffee wafting out immediately. The barrel character makes itself known, but does not smell hot....lingering sweetness of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate and a final dose of heavy roast. Taste is delicate, yet bold. Nice medley of coffee and chocolate out of the gate. Simmers into oak, vanilla and fudge....and then the bourbon creeps in to take the sweetness of the edges. Great mouthfeel, thick but not chewy...seems the barrel thinned this out in comparison to the non-BA Vietnamese version I had. Still, this body holds up nicely against the backbone and never tasted ""hot"". Finish was very oily and gave a great bitter coffee splash with more chocolate, vanilla to compliment the oak/bourbon.

>>> AleSmith strikes again with a wonderfully rich and balanced coffee imperial stout. The mouthfeel is out of this world. 

+  Like most Speedway variants, the beer is beautiful. Pitch black with a medium beige-brown head, very good retention and some lacing 
+  Flavors of coffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon and even marshmallow are all very intense and deep, but at the same time they are totally cohesive and nothing is overpowering 
+  The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, super silky and rich with a mild alcohol warmth at the end 
+  Its on par with the best Speedway variants along the regular, the non barrel-aged Vietnamese one and the bourbon barrel-aged Speedway.

Full of fudge and ground coffee on the nose with lots of dough cream and a warming barrel appearance. Coffee is extremely well pronounced, revealing a flowery berry quality, gently wrapped up into fudge and charred malts. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth, very soft on the tongue with an intense barrel infusion, creating a hot bite during the finish, together with bitter coffee.

Tastes of sweeter fudge, immediately coated up by earthy, silk coffee with a faint berry quality to it. This foundation gets joined by a prominent, vanilla heavy, warming barrel, adding smoky oak, camp fire warmth, resin and a whiff of hazelnuts to the taste. Finishes with present, hot, dry bourbon among cream, coated by coffee and fudgy booze.

Drinking all of these side-by-side while becoming increasingly intoxicated drives home a few points. (1) they all pretty much taste the same -- I mean, the bourbon barrel versions are a little smoother with more bourbon/vanilla with the coffee in the background, but with the exception of regular Vietnamese I couldnt telly you which of the many variants I was drinking without looking closely at the bottle. (2) thats fine, though, because theyre all pretty tasty.

1013,"2015-02-06",4.4,"Bottle @ The luxury tasting continues shared with Countbeer. Opaque pitch black color, medium sized dark brown head that diminishes quickly. Aroma is intens: bourbon and dark chocolate up front, roasted malts and coffee thereafter and lightly some alcohol. Taste roasted malts, bourbon, bourbon mixed with coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, slightly wood, sweet initially with bitter notes coming through occasionally as well as towards the end of each sip.

1013,"2015-01-02",4.4,"2014 Bomber - jet black Speedway pour with mocha head and a sliver of retention. Nose is roast, coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Taste is an amazing balance of coffee, vanilla, whiskey, and roast. Has a light sweetness to it and that really brings it all together. Thick on the palate but not too oily. Simply awesome.

1013,"2014-12-23",4.5,"Appearance: Pours black with a quickly faded head.

Aroma: Honey grahams, bourbon, milk chocolate.

Taste: Woody bourbon. Acidic dark roasted coffee, tannins, dark chocolate.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied, astringent, mild carbonation.

Overall: This is an amazing variation on Speedway Stout. One of the most balanced barrel aged versions Ive had as well. The booze, the roast, the chocolate and the coffee were all in perfect balance on this batch. Tremendous work. Those who snagged the bottles oughta think twice before trading it away for some midwest shelf beer.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

1013,"2014-11-29",4.5,"Big thanks to Nick (nbutler11) for sharing this beauty. The 750mL pours with a murky chocolate brownie colored body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma offers up dark roasted malts, marshmallows, thick rich dark roasted coffee, some burnt malts, chocolate brownie and smooth candy like bourbon notes, wow! The taste delivers rich chocolate brownie, smooth rich dark roasted coffee and soft pillowy marshmallows swimming in a thin stream of smooth bourbon goodness. Good gravy, this only gets better as it warms. Love it!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Some coconut, hazelnut, and charred oak. Flavor is a touch on the hot side. A lot of bourbon, hazelnut, coconut, and creamy coffee. Some caramel, earthy coffee, and spice. Moderate roast and marshmallow. Nice stuff.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
1013,"2014-11-26",4.5,"Had this on cask @ Speedway Grand Prix. Much like the regular BA Speedway which I love. Bourbon was pretty present but didnt take away from the actual beer itself too much.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Odeed"
1013,"2014-11-26",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2015 Keg at the brewery during the 2014 Speedway Grand Prix, 14/11/14 (but not part of the Speedway GP).
Pitch black with a dirty tan swirl.
Nose is rich roast, bourbon, coffee beans, spice, chocolate.
Taste comprises rich chocolate, coffee, light charr, spice, decadent bourbonics.
Full bodied, viscous feel, light warming alcohol in the close, never gets too hot.
Solid BA impy, the bourbon has taken quite a foothold though, will be good to revisit in a year or so when it has mellowed.
Bottle re rate 19/06/15.
Has improved quite a few notches since 3.9 rating on tao. More coffee, less booze, mellowed nicely.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"

>> Three different samples over a two day period. Flatter ink black pour with wispy yellow lacing. Nose is more in the Creme Brulée vein than the Creme Brulée version of Speedway on tap today. But the main character in the nose after it warms is almost pure rum raisin. Taste is a bit sweet and almost all bourbon barrel forward with big rum raisin, flashes of soy. If you like the nuanced flavors of the Vietnamese coffee, they are gone, taken over by the barrel. I honestly dont see the point of this beer as it kills off what makes the Vietnamese version so good. Rich bitter chocolate? Gone. Balanced hoppiness? Gone. Vietnamese Coffee flavor? Gone. Soft palate- silky and rich with well integrated bourbon.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
