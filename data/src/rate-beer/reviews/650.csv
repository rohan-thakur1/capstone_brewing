650,"2015-01-09",3.6,"Pours a thick, deep, dark body with half-inch tan cap of foam that dissipates relatively quickly. Inviting aroma with rich, milky chocolate up front and some earthy nuttiness on the back. 
Taste is not nearly as sweet as the smell. Coffee and vanilla flavors combined with a robust, raw cocoa taste, likely derived from the added cacao nibs. Roasted malt backbone finished with a hint of acidity.
Lactic taste offers a warm balance. Slightly bitter finish, yet exceptionally smooth.","Mendham, New Jersey, USA","dhatton"

650,"2014-10-09",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 1-21-14-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass 

 Appearance  The beer pours a deep brown color boarding on black with a two finger head of a brown color. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading to leave tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is massive of a sweet milk chocolate aroma. It is also quite heavy of a roasted malt smell as well as some sweeter lactose and cream aromas. Along with these smells are some caramel and toffee with just a hint of coffee. Overall it is a big, delicious, sweet chocolate smell. 

 Taste  The taste is not like the nose suggested, instead it is much drier. The taste begins with a big roasted malt flavor with some lightly lactose sweetened cocoa flavors. Along with the lactose/milk sweetness are some other sweet flavors of a bit of a caramel and toffee. The caramel and toffee quickly fade however, with the lactose sweetness losing some intensity as well. Along the same time the roasted flavors grow more intense and some bitter coffee flavors come to the flavor profile. With a light earthy flavor coming to the tongue at the end, one is left with a lightly bitter, and somewhat drier cocoa flavor to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the medium to slightly heavier side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. Overall the feel was rather appropriate for the drier cocoa flavors of the brew accentuating the roasty flavors nicely. 

 Overall  A rather drier and more cocoa flavored milk stout. After the sweet and delicious nose I was slightly thrown off by the taste, but overall it was still a rather tasty brew.","","Darkmagus82"
650,"2014-09-02",3.6,"Growler filled at local beer and wine retailer. Dark black/brown with thin dark brown head. Aroma of milk chocolate and almost a hint of cream. Tastes and smells like a chocolate shake. Very intense tasty beverage, not for everyday drinking, but a nice treat that would pair well with a desert (fresh raspberries and cream perhaps).","Maryland, USA","Maxbier"
650,"2014-08-19",3.9,"Bomber from mdg164, thanks Marc! Pours a very, very dark brown with a light brown head - a bit foamy - with many concentric circles of lace. Rich looking. Aroma has cocoa nibs, caramel and milk chocolate. Taste is sweet caramel, milk chocolate, some nuttiness and light molasses. Quite sweet and milky, but the chocolate lends some bitterness to stop it from getting cloying, and the lactose is not too over the top either - making it more milk chocolate than milk. Medium to full bodied with almost no alcohol presence. Finishes sweetly, but with some bitterness from the chocolate and nuts. A very tasty brew with a lot of depth to it. 14.4","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
650,"2014-08-16",3.3,"On tap at the bocktown. Big and dark. No head. Aroma is that of a chocolate bar, no lie! Taste is the same, the initial flavor is so chocolatey. Surprizingly not as bitter as many choco beers Ive had int he past, this is more like milk chocolate. Decent co2 too. Yes, choco is good at first but ast he session continues there is a growing sense of annoyance on my nerves. Probably couldnt have more than a couple of these. But overall, yes, one of the better choco beers Ive tasted over the years, quite acceptable.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
650,"2014-07-11",3.9,"Pours opaque black with a 3-finger tan head. Nice chocolatey aroma with a roasty malt note beneath. Body is medium-to-full, with a light thickness and a mild dryness to the finish. Flavor of chocolate with a strong char underneath. A light, sweet note of dairy cream shows at the back before the char returns in the finish. An excellent variation on one of my favorite milk stouts.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","BillWyce"
650,"2014-05-31",4.5,"Opened up a 22 oz sitting in my fridge since Xmas and gotta say the aroma is the best of any Chocolate beer Ive had. Like rich, hot cocoa with the slightest roasted grain. Pours pitch black and flavor hits right away with deep dark roasted malts, coffee, leather and of course chocolate!! It finishes with a perfect hop bitterness that brings balance and an almost bittersweet chocolate finish. Just a tad thin around the middle, so not a grand slam, but definitely a home run.",", Pennsylvania, USA","beerguy717"

650,"2014-02-21",3.5,"Bottle. Pours a clear dark brown body under small fizzy light brown head. The nose is crazy intense on the cocoa and chocolate, this smells more like a candy than a beer. Some nice light nutty, caramel, and roast undertones, but this is all about the chocolate. The flavor is fairly sweet, but not as much as I was expecting. The cocoa actually fairly well balanced with the roast and lactose flavors. Medium bodied with just a slight clinginess on the finish and soft fizzy carbonation.
