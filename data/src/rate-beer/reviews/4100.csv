4100,"2010-09-13",3.4,"Tap @ Mikkeller Bar, Cph.
Pours muddy pale darkish yellow with a small, creamy, white rim. Aroma is softly tart, oaky, light wheat sweetness, some green apple. Highish carbonation, kinda light and slightly watery palate - mostly because of the oaky dryness. Flavour is mildly tart, extremely dry, some vanilla, light malty sweetness in there. Long, lingering, light vinious and very dry finish. Too bad that it feels so thin and the oak takes up so much of the flavours.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

Den er lidt mere tydelig i smagen, men man skal lede en del efter calvados fadene. Men der mangler karbonering for min smag.","Husum, DENMARK","Defreni"
