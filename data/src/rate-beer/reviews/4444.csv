Dry, musty notes and dry earth, a bit of oak, truly funky sulphurous notes basically absent. A bare hint of acetone starting to creep in.

4444,"2015-09-05",4.5,"Special, limited edition of Hanssens Oude Kriek with exclusively (hand picked) Schaarbeekse griottes; probably the same thing as their Scarenbecca, but with a dutch label for the home market. Moussy, opening but still fairly stable, lacing, dirty pink head over an initially clear, beautifully deep purplish, intense ruby red beer, misty with deposit. Very funky, strong lambic aroma with tons of sour cherries soaked in it; red wine vinegar, pink grapefruit flesh, wet hay, leather, horse meat, dried tomato, raw beetroot, barnyard, red fruit yoghurt, moist wood and a slight and elusive hint of vanilla-like oak tannins, even a hint of menure but still inherent to the overall lambic character. Puckering sourness is the first to hit the mouth, as if you are biting in a slice of lemon, immediately awakening the taste buds; apart from lemony lambic acidity, there is unmistakably a truckload of sour cherry acidity, juicy and litterally mouth watering. More sedate yoghurt-like lactic acidity shows up as well of course, adding another layer of tartness; a deeply buried wheatiness and barley breadiness provide structure and body. Carbonation is fairly soft but just fit for the style. Finish has ongoing lemon and sour cherry acidity, lending it a bone dry effect along with drying woodiness and, only very far away and going by almost unnoticed, a deep but brief hint of old hops. The juicy cherry sourness coats the mouth and goes down deep into the throat. This is not a kriek for beginners, that much is clear: it showcases the tart character of the griottes in all their glory, embedded as they are in a very Bretty, horse meat-like Hanssens lambic juiciness and funkiness. A completely world-class masterpiece in its style as far as I am concerned.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Tastes of ripe sour cherries with its stone qualities being overly visible, among glue and tart funk. Utmost fruity, while featuring a distinct fermented note of young wine, with cherries remaining on top. Cherries are tart and rich at the same time, very pleasant and juicy.

Offers a well pronounced sourness in the taste, together with soddled malts and a good amount of funky jogurt. Cherry skin is very prominent, almost a bit leathery, wrapped up by dust and fermented fruit pulp. Finishes sweeter among a very prominent sourness, revealing notes of ripe cherries and a long lasting, slick acidity.

4444,"2015-07-22",3.8,"How: Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. Shared by AdamChandler, thanks!

>>> A bright sour cherries lambic with a rather high sourness level. 

+  Gorgeous appearance with a deep bright red color and a small white head leaving some lacing 
+  The aroma is very enticing with a burst of cherries joined by a moderate well integrated spiciness 
−  The sourness level is high, to be point of being a bit harsh 
−  The high sourness level hinders both the balance and drikinability 
−  Carbonation is a tad low

Flavors:  Sour cherries, lemon, cinnamon, cheese, leather, cloves","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4444,"2015-07-21",3.5,"Bottle shared by AdamChandler, thanks a lot for sharing that rarity Adam! Pours a cherry red with a small pink rim that leaves low lacing. Nose is of cherry and faint spices and rubber. Taste is really acidic with good cherries. Body is medium, carbonation moderate and I believe I could not drink a whole lot of this because of the over the top sourness. This coming from a guy that doesnt appreciate oude krieks as much as everyone else, I thought the balance wasnt too good, I wish these would retain a slight residual sweetness sometimes.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

4444,"2015-07-09",4.5,"2015 Batch from Toer de Gueuze, bottle enjoyed with 77Ships and others @ Hanssens. Great weather, nice day. it was 16 Euro for 75CLs no limit for take-away. Label says ""hand picked"" and is brighter than previous batches

Color is the deepest, darkest red Ive ever seen...bits of purple. Aroma is delicate, balanced, light tartness and an explosion of a cherry smoothie for me. not that overly sweet either. The taste is explosive. No acetic sour tastes, no phenols, no plastic. Cherry juice, 18-24 month lambic, juicy, and a lot of wood. The amount of cherries must be approaching 30% volumes (300g p/L). Good mouthfeel but might need more time in the bottle. Honestly, I should have grabbed a few more of these. An exceptional batch. juicy, not acidic, not too sour a friend with us who had not bought bottles, tasted this and then bought 6! :)","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Aroma hasnt got all that much in the nose, but really packs a punch on the palate. Fresh sweet cherries, slightly unripe sour cherries, iron, minerals, slight fart/barnyard - stuff. Some pebery stuff in here as well. Quite the complex player youre dealing with. 
Taste is fruity sweet up front, with plenty of sourness from te middle and out. Mouth watering sour.

The taste is pretty tart upfront, yet very juicy, bursting full with sour cherry, cherry pie, red wine, big woody action, vanilla, almond, lemony sherbet, tart green apple and some acidity with tart-sweet finish.

Aroma is extreme and complex; huge sweet fresh raspberries, mild sweetness and strong funky earthiness. Flavour is very big and bold with juicy raspberries, raspberry seeds, jam, cinnamon, tart dry wood, bright sourness, mild citrusy acidity, redcurrant and rich funkiness. Mild graininess and soured milk too. As it warms up a bit the spiciness grows. Almost full bodied and its only 6% ABV. Uncompromising and almost flawless.

Tasty. Great mix of sour cherries and lovely barrel notes. Slightly too acidic for my taste, maybe the bottle is too fresh, but still well balanced. I didnt have more than a handful of Krieks before, but this is my favourite so far.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

Utterly radiating neon red, little in the way of head. Only on the sides.

I didnt get the Red wine & light herb notes that I remember 2013 Scarenbecca having, Crazily juicy, drinks like water, not much to be found in the way of carbonation.
