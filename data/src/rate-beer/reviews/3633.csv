3633,"2015-10-10",3.7,"Cask ar Galbraith. Clear copper color with a small white head. The aroma is coconut and sweet malts, mild herbal hops. Slightly sweet flavor base, herbal tea, caramel. Medium light body with a casky (come on, you know what I mean) mouthfeel. Legit!","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
3633,"2014-01-28",2.0,"Bitter apples, plant matter, tea leaves. husky grains, stale yeast powder, wort. Very raw and unfinished, with an acidic orange jelly malt sweetness and astringent tea leaf hoppiness. An absolutely lifeless cask ale that leaves bile acidity lingering in the mouth and throat. From cask at Galbraith Brewing in Auckland.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3633,"2013-09-24",3.8,"The head is good, the body orange golden. It smells malty, decent, fruity. The taste is frutiy, aromatic, hoparomatic, less bitter. Tasty! 12/12/13/12/-/13 3.8","Otorohanga, NEW ZEALAND","kiwianer"
3633,"2013-08-22",3.3,"Cask - Galbraiths, Auckland. A clear, golden amber in colour with a fine soapy white head. This is British bitter as it should be done. Simple, lightly hopped, lovely juicy malt body and sessionable beyond belief. Not going to knock anyones socks off flavour-wise but then its not designed to. However, in terms of precision and quaffability its a real winner. About as solid as youll get. Good grassy English hops, some earth, a bit of biscuit and yeast and pleasant mid-fruits coming through. The key here is integration and balance. Light to medium body, soft carbonation and mouthfeel with a soft intensity, modest length finish. After a slog at work, I raced here for something wet and alcoholic to neck and this slaked my thirst a good-un. It goes to show that bigger isnt always better; as long as youre nailing it then subtle and low-key can really hit the spot. Next time youre in Auckland, head to Galbraiths and the only words youll need are: ""a pint of Bob, please.""","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","sm89walt"
3633,"2013-08-22",2.8,"Cask handpull at the source. Crystal clear golden color, white edge head. Aroma of subtle black pepper. Taste is pepper and straw. A classic English bitter.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3633,"2013-07-17",3.6,"Light in colour, hand pumped from beer engine, light body and very easy to drink. Low level ester profile and balanced bitterness, very sessionable.","AUSTRALIA","Jessop"
3633,"2013-04-10",3.8,"Light, appley, the hop has little bitterness but lends a nice, spicy character.  Very English, a real treat so far from that island.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3633,"2013-03-31",3.4,"On tap at the brewpub. Served a golden color with a decent head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma of some citrus and fruit with a bit of malt in the background. Taste of mild fruit and some malt sweetness. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Fairly moderate body  and quite smooth. Reminds me of a sessionable English bitter. Nothing wromg with a little ""old school"" .","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
3633,"2013-01-15",3.5,"Appeared yellow-gold with a firm collar of white head. A little watery in the mouth but seems sessionable enough. Flavours of citrus and apple with beautiful gooseberry. A pleasing pint and very similar to what my beloved Twisted Hop Golding Bitter used to be prior to the earthquake.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
3633,"2012-10-24",2.8,"a bit too sweet, not very bitter or dry. Not so balanced. Fairly boring, even for the style.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
3633,"2012-05-09",4.2,"Excellent example of an English pale ale. Great for a summer session, maybe with a ploughmans lunch.","","AussieAl"
3633,"2012-04-27",4.1,"Hand pulled with nice small off white head that soon settles and some lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is mild,malt, cracker, grain, hint of caramel and hop. Flavor is similar to nose, with great balance of hop to sweet malt and carbonic tang - sweet coming out slightly on top. Body is great, a little chewy and ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, short in length, and super drinkable. Could go on indefinitely with this.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
3633,"2011-02-06",4.1,"Golden, very lightly spritzy, small white head. Lovely floral citrussy aromas with a hint of caramel. Slick mouthfeel..I get a really nice nuttyness and slight malt sweetness along with a unique hop character I assume is from the Styrians. Balanced and way too drinkable. A beer that helped me get into craft beer and one I still enjoy very much.","NEW ZEALAND","matthewsmith"
3633,"2010-03-05",3.6,"Lots of light citrussy hop notes. Smooth and rich malt body without being too cloying. Very nice example of the style. Finishes with a nice slick of bitterness and has a light bodied easy drinking nature. Could happily spend an afternoon on this","Chch, NEW ZEALAND","snuffla"
3633,"2010-01-31",3.8,"Draught at Galbraiths Alehouse, Auckland.  Nice place to drink their nice beer. Orange hue, very small white head which diminishes. Beautiful fruity aromas especially grapefruit and passion fruit. Reminded me a bit of Little Creatures pale ale aroma. Amazing flavour, very sweet, moderately bitter. No carbonation, sweet then bitter finish that lingers. Really really nice.","Tauranga, NEW ZEALAND","beer4eternity"
3633,"2009-10-19",3.3,"Cask at the brewpub.  Pours clear gold with a small white head.  Little carbonation.  Hoppy aroma, with fruit, malt and wood.  Bitter.  Light body, somewhat watery, and smooth from lack of carbonation.  Unmistakably English style.  Good session beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3633,"2007-08-15",3.0,"Smelt some gooseberries or lime on the nose but not too much else. Flavour is mild on hops and a bit cardboardy in an easy drinking way ( tastes carbonated though its not). Bit thin (especially compared to the other brews here). Good honest session beer.","Dunedin, NEW ZEALAND","DiscoForever"
3633,"2007-05-21",4.2,"Spritzy light coloured session bitter, i find this beer very refreshing. Fruity malt with light bitterness another good example of its style","Bakewell, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","kempicus"

3633,"2006-06-05",4.8,"Served from the cask via beer engine with a sparkler. Pours a light gold with a thick white head . Aromas of stone fruit and citrus with a touch of earthy hop. Palate starts lightly malty with a touch of the characteristic marris otter nuttyness.  Bitterness builds along with goldings hop flavour before finishing mineraly and bitter. Outstanding bitter that shows how much flavour can be combined in a low gravity ale.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","OStreetBrewery"
3633,"2006-02-08",3.8,"Cask at the brewpub. Deep golden. Fruity hay aroma. Sweet and malty with soft, rounded mouthfeel. Chewy with notes of ripe fruits and medium bitterness. An honest, English style bitter.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

Flavour is good, faint caramel malt aroma as well.  Flavour is well-balanced, a bit thin but still has good hop flavour, light bitterness and very easy to drink.  Nice session beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3633,"2005-01-27",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2005 Tasted 27/01/2005.  Hand drawn and cask conditioned at Galbraiths Ale House.
A real treat, this one.  A bitter ale with a New Zealand twist.  Pours bright and clear, a red tinted gold with a collapsing off white head.  Looks like there perfect beer for sitting on the Galbraiths garden balcony after a long hot day at work.  Punchy bouquet of passionfruit and citrus zest that fades to a pithy citrus aroma further down the glass.  Flavour and light mouthfeel is superbly quaffable, nicely fruity with a light bitterness.  Palate is very clean.
This one, though quite a different malt and hop profile, really challenges Emersons Bookbinder for my pick as NZs number one session beer.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"
3633,"2004-12-01",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2005 Just had to update my rating for ths one after enjoying a pint with yalnikim last night. My type of bitter this one, with the bitterness being offset by a zestiness from citrus flavours. Very easy to drink, and the Galbraiths environ certainly helps.  Definitely a session beer this one.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"
3633,"2004-04-20",3.2,"not a bad ""ordinary"". paler and not as sticky as the other bitters at galbraiths, starts with a simple, meek maris otter taste and finishes quite classily with some Styrian pepper in the finish, simple but thirst-quenching, hard and salty, definitely Burtonised.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
3633,"2003-05-26",2.9,"The Bob Hudson I remember had a song a long time ago that paid homage to Newcastle in NSW. This beer sidles up to you and says ""gidday"", ya wanna drink me? The answer is ""yeah alrite"". Good beer for its ABV and the mouthfeel suggests that the water has been Burtonised in the appropriate manner.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"
3633,"2002-04-08",3.7,"Light copper coloured.  British caramel malt aroma.  Hoppy flavour to start with a nice malty middle and a lingering bitter finish.  Very British tasting.  Good mouthfeel.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
