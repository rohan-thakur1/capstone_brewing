3225,"2017-06-08",3.1,"12 oz single bottle from Total Wine & More - Laguna Hills. Clear orange colored appearance with a small beige head. Aroma of toasted grain, light honey malt and light zesty hops. Similar flavor, adding a mild malt sweetness and a light bitterness. Light, crisp, balanced and pretty clean overall. Solid LAger, kind of refreshing after mowing the lawn.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
3225,"2017-05-21",3.5,"Draft. Pours gold with a white head. Relatively clean up front, with faint honey-like sweetness, and just a touch of bitterness. Clean and drinkable.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"

3225,"2017-03-22",3.8,"Draft at the Whisky A Go Go, a downright good, tasty and surprisingly enjoyable lager. I usually avoid the fizzy yellow lager beers, but this was recommended by a friend, and went well with the rock N roll show. Id drink another if I had one here.","California, USA","kevinator63"
3225,"2017-03-03",2.2,"Bottle pour. Appearance is clear amber with trace sparkle, less-than-finger-width white head with poor retention and minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet honey and bready malts fighting a dank, herbal funk. Taste is sweet bready/pie crust malts with European hop bitterness, light earthy/herbal funk, late sweet honey. Palate is light-to-medium bodied with thin texture, average carbonation and European hop bitter finish, bordering on slightly metallic/skunky. Overall, not impressed by this one.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
3225,"2017-01-19",3.1,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazy orange gold with small off white head that lasts. The aroma is grain and honey. Medium body, honey, wheat, light finish, good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3225,"2017-01-01",3.2,"4.8%ABV. Lager.

Poured out light amber. 12ºSRM.

Nose had brown ale aromas, mainly nutty, roasty aromas.

Mouthfeel is really full bodied for a lager. Palate has some browned toast and pie crusts.

Finish is clean and beery.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"
3225,"2016-06-19",2.9,"Draft at Angel City. Hazy golden pour, odd for this style, with good foam. Green aroma with grassy hops, aloe flesh. Celery salt flavor, weird, mild bitterness, well balanced, dry, black pepper end, strange. Not that bad though, just a strange beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3225,"2016-06-04",3.4,"Draft @ Trip in Santa Monica. Pleasing thick-in-middle-more-translucent-on-the-edges. Light citrus aroma. Blurb says, ""lightly sweet"", but its classy, nuanced, and gives the citrus zest some fat juice. Nothing like a sweet or a sour but kid of like a citrus IPA without the hops. Light taste but satisfying. Salt and citrus. Medium palate. Very pleased with this local brewers LAger.","California, USA","yackery"

3225,"2015-11-09",3.5,"On tap at the brewery. Server says real grapefruit in this. It shows - grapefruit aroma strong, and some grapefruit bitterness. Maybe Im imaginging a hint of salt. not your typical lager. Refreshing, decent.","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
