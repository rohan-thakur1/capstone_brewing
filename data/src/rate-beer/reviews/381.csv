381,"2015-08-02",3.3,"750mL bottle, I assume one and only Batch #1, bottled March 2013, drunk 7/24/15. Big thanks to Adam for sharing this rare lambic!Good pour with a moderate amount of white head that slowly recedes to cover. Deep peachy-gold body is well-carbonated, and shows a great clarity, leaving sediment behind.What a nose!!! Holy Cantillon! All of the barrels that went in to this beer are Boon-based lambic, assumedly, but it smells so similar to Cantillon that I would almost definitely tend to identify it as such, blindly. Huge sourness, cheesy lactic notes, burnt rubber, sulfur and a big woodiness. Not the lighter, more tart and fruity brett-heavy notes of something like 3F or Hanssens. Wonderfully strong, lasting aroma and I sniffed it for a good five minutes before trying my first sip. Maybe not quite the complexity of the best Cantillon guezes Ive had, but right up there, nonetheless. No alcohol noted, no flaws.The flavor is heavily acidic, heavily dry with intense woodiness (heavily tannic, very dry) and, unfortunately, a bit of near-acetone-like bitter astringency on the end. This throws off the balance and the alcohol, as Ive found it to do in lambics, loosens the body, exacerbating this heavy acidity/bitterness. Other than that, its still full of interesting and funky lambic flavors; lemons, cheese, barnyard, band-aids and so forth. Just not quite making good on what the aroma seemed to promise. Carbonation levels are appropriate, texture is slick-to-watery and there are no off-flavors (other than the intense tannin and acetone-like notes). Very interesting and wont soon forget the nose on this thing. Thanks, Adam!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Taste/Mouthfeel: Very lightly carbed despite what I initially perceived. It is very close to being flat. A moderate, yet soft burst of that funky aroma comes out in the taste. Disappears very quickly. Its very delicate and soft on the palate unlike any other gueuze Ive ever tasted. Tastes like someone bottled up some funky basement mold.

Very clear woody Boon funk in the nose, bitter peel, light esters, lots of bitter wood in the nose, Bitter wood, green apple, touch watery, light cider, bitter ester, lots of Boon wood in here, touch soap,.. Softer carb, touch watery, Lacks in complexity, nowhere near for instance Vat 44. Decent but not very developed. Still a nice beer, just pales when compared to other geuzes.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Pours clear blonde , ok white head . 
Smell is funky , sharp , sour , wood . 
Boon , but in a very balanced and nice way . 
Ok carbo 
Taste is dry , tad sweet ( as most boon-beers ) very typical . Bit nitter , ok , not too different though in a blind tasting it would be hard to pick this out of his other geuzes ..","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
