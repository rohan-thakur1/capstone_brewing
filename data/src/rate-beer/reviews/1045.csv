Nose is heavy, heavy thick malt, toasted marshmallow, smoke. Mouth is super sweet and thick, with burned sugars, maple syrup, some smoke, and a bitter finish that borders on acrid. Not one of the better ones.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

1045,"2016-03-04",4.6,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours pitch-black with a mid-sized, brown head. The aroma is a deep, dark, decadent swirl of hot fudge, red wine, and assorted dark berries and whiskeys. Ultra-full-bodied, chewy and velvety with adequate carbonation. The flavor offers a mélange of sweet bourbon, dark fudge, brownie brittle, pouch tobacco and a light ration of smokiness. Sweet throughout, but also bold, roasty and warming. Delicious, world-class beer courtesy of 50belair. Matt brings the noise!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1045,"2016-02-04",4.3,"Aroma and taste dominated by spirits from barrel aging. Underneath, the layers of complexity from the multiple barrels get hidden but still noticeable. As this has been out for awhile, not sure if age will help the blend ever become more balanced.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","JJMBeer"

1045,"2015-09-07",4.9,"750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Pours a deep, dark, cloudy - but not quite opaque - brown with a small brown head that settles into a ring and just a small island of film. The initial aroma is flawless, and it remains consistent as it warms: vanilla, maple syrup, cocoa, oak, brown sugar, toasted coconut and marshmallow, and roasted malts. The flavor undergoes more of an evolution as it goes down: earlier sips are sweeter, with vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, maple syrup, toasted wheat, and roast. But as it warms and opens up, a note of smoke and toasted oak emerges, adding a totally new, interesting, balancing element. Medium-full bodied, with a smooth, sweet, velvety mouthfeel that becomes roastier and smokier as it goes on. Modest carbonation. Absolutely stunning. This is exactly what Id want in a barrel-aged imperial stout. Its also why, as I get into so many other styles and every style is evolving and expanding, I come back to this as my favorite. Theres pretty much nothing more that can be done to make a drink more satisfying to me.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1045,"2015-07-14",4.2,"Bottle. Sweet, boozy aroma of moderate bourbon, decadent dark chocolate, medium charred smoke, vanilla, and an earthy roasted malt note. Pours glossy dark brown with mahogany highlights. Very layered taste of cocoa, old oak, vanilla, a bit of phenol, a brief hint of rich maple syrup, and a decent amount of alcohol heat from the barrel-aging. A delightful, complex beer; each component of the blend takes its time in the limelight without stepping on the other flavors toes.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
