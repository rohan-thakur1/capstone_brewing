4018,"2017-06-19",3.8,"Solid pale ale, but definitely overrated. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed this pale ale a ton. The mouthfeel is ridiculous for being a pale ale. Feels much more like an IPA. It has a tropical taste going on which is great as well. Im a big fan of this beer, but I still think its a bit overrated.","Seattle, ","joec311"

4018,"2017-05-21",3.5,"The ratings for this beer are rather remarkable, and Im sure in a fresh pour from tap theres something wonderful about tasting such a beer--sometimes high ratings garner future high ratings. I had a canned version, and it was an excellent beer, but certainly nothing game-changing or especially memorable. Juicy, fruity aroma, good balance and highly drinkable.

The palate is a slightly bitter biscuit, earthy, I cant put my finger on it...what this tastes like. Its not sweet. Meaty, perhaps? Let me crack my second one. Ah. This one sounds good. Yes, sounds healthy. Letting this one sit a while in the glass to warm up a bit. Picking up sweet, sticky pine on the nose & dried mango.

 Kolor:  Jasnobursztynowy. Piwo jest w 100%-ach klarowne. 
 Piana:  Jest wysoka, bujna, w umiarkowanym tempie opada do chmurki. Nie wylewa się z szkła przy agresywnym nalewaniu.
Biała, drobnoziarnista warstewka puchu przez długi czas wisi nad piwem.
Lacing godny mistrzów. 
 Zapach:  Fantastyczny aromat owoców tropikalnych. Zaraz po odkapslowaniu puszki mam ochotę pochłonąć ją w całości i ominąć etap przelewania do szkła.
Pachnie mango, marakują, 
a na przeciwko tych owoców stają w szranki cytrusy. Nie brakuje ananasów, grejpfrutów, czy mandarynek. Nuty żywicy, lasu i igiełek sosnowych uzupełniają profil zapachowy. 
 Smak:  Dopiero po 5, czy 6-tym łyku byłem w stanie cokolwiek napisać. Sue jest tak nieziemsko gładkie w odbiorze. Początkowa wyraźna słodowa baza po kilku pierwszych haustach zostaje wypierana przez solidne nachmielenie.
Słodsze owoce (mango, papaja) w miarę upływu czasu przechodzą w cytrusy (pomarańcze, mandarynki, ananasy, grejpfruty).

Toppling Goliath stanął na wysokości zadania i sprostał swojej legendzie.
Uraczył mnie jednym z najlepszych piw w tym stylu jakie piłem.

Amazing aroma: smells of citrus and tropical fruits, orange floral hop, very perfumed, a bit woody, faint vanilla, spicy biscuit malt. Taste is dry and bitter, spicy amber malt, big but a little thin/watery in the finish and compared to the nose. Body is quite bitter, watery but very smooth/creamy, lightly sweetish spicy frothier malt finish. Excellent - bright and fresh tasting, big but still refined/smooth.","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"

4018,"2017-03-27",3.6,"This is a good if unexceptional IPA. Its a hazy pale orange color w/ a fine-bubbled white head. I am getting a sort of foxy concord grape character out of this and a good deal of sweet citrus as well. Its only a touch sweet but fairly full-bodied and oily in texture. This is nice and bitter with a hint of a minty herbal sort of note in the finish which I am not 100% crazy about. Still, this stuff is nice and hoppy and perfectly drinkable.

This beer meets the hype as a superb example of an APA. Gold in body topped with two-fingers worth of head. Smells like a musty grapefruit (in a good way). A hopped forward beer where grapefruit and pine battle it out over just enough graininess from the malts. Initial mouthfeel is wet, but it leaves a long dry finish. Although, good in a way, the residual bitterness prevents me from awarding a couple more points. Ive had other citra hop beers providing similar characteristics, yet this one has done the best job.","","balloonbuffoon"

4018,"2016-11-10",4.5,"Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a golden burnt amber color with a foamy to bubbly white head that quickens the pace of letting the lace of being messy all over.
The aroma starts off with some sharp bitter pineu hops purely agitating a sly earthy sweet malt. Citrus hops slyly move in for a subtle balance.
The flavor balances quite nicely between the piney bittersweet hops and citrus hops. Malt level seems to lay back a tad bit more. Pineyness grips the aftertaste and leads on into the finish. 
On the palate, this one leans to the lighter side between light and medium bodied. Low carbonation yields to the hops embracing a keen bitterness as the harshness punctuating my tongue.
Overall, what a damn American Pale ale, that I would love to have again. Awesome in its entirety and purely substantial with whatever food one would want with it.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

The palate is medium bodied and fully carbonated. Flavors of the same tropical fruit with a moderate intensity showing throughout and continuing until the finish with a slight reveal of bready malts on the linger.

Re-rate thanks to Matt Lutton! I had more of this and feel I can give a better opinion of it now that Ive had more than a couple oz in a tasting.

A: Semi clear orange, thin white head head. 

N: Pine, soap, grapefruit, lemon rind, earth, damp leaves, pineapple, and biscuit. I find that this about does it for the flavors and they arent quite as rich as I remember.

T: Huge bitterness, soft sweetness.

M: No alcohol, medium body, spritzy carbonation. Pretty dry beer.

O: Quite good but dropping it down a few points after having a chance to really investigate it. Still easy drinking with good flavor, but after having the Cryo Pale from Pfriem, I wouldnt put this on the same level flavorwise.

4018,"2016-08-09",4.3,"16 ounce can from Trigs in Wausau, WI (July 2016), consumed at slightly above fridge temp from a Guinness pint glass. Oily-hazy bright, almost luminous gold body is topped by a large frothy slow-diminishing off-white cap, which leaves thick foam gouts in the glass....aroma is expectedly fruity/citric (orange, grapefruit) but also resinous/piney and interestingly funky/sweaty, with some lovely spicy hints (cinnamon) to round it out; its hugely brash and potent and that odd mixture really works...in the mouth it feels just a tad watery at first, but the body seems to get stronger towards the finish; its rather acidic and certainly quite hoppy for an APA, but I think keeps it tamped down enough to qualify for the style as opposed to an IPA - the malts are in the end more pronounced, and though theres a bit of caramel, and just a touch of syrupy alcoholic feel, the end product is extraordinarily drinkable and the sweet-dry balance is to my taste nearly perfect for this kind of beer.

Medium thick, off-white, lacing head, hazy golden blonde robe with greenish hue. Dank IPA aroma of lemongrass, grapefruit flesh, tropical flowers, some hops urine, mandarin, mango, lychee, passion fruit, green banana, white bread, butter. Fruity, crisp onset, clean with lively green banana, mango, lychee and passion fruit sweetishness and sourishness, medium carbo just fit for the style, clean and smooth pale malt sweetishness leading to a long, very aromatically and softly but thoroughly bittering hop finish with lots of retronasal floral, citrusy and piney aromas.

Appearance - body is Mikado yellow, with a slight haze. The head is white and around 1 1/2"", foamy, and settles slowly. Some lacing.
Taste - has an initial wave of tropical fruit. Grapefruit, mango, and a dash of lemon. There is also some resin quality. There is a special item here, that takes a while to discern. If you sift deep enough you can pick up just a faint touch of what Id call garden herb. There is carrot, roast garlic, rosemary, and sundried tomato in a slight dash. Truly impressive.

4018,"2016-01-25",4.6,"COD 12/29/15. Clear amber pour that is slightly darker than golden. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

World class nose that really brings it for an APA. Citrus (orange, tangerine) over a surprising level of dankness with mild pine elements. As it warms, the citric elements come more forward, adding mango and pear.

Light medium body with an almost slick texture fueled by hop oils. Normal carbonation level with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a slightly prickly finish.

The flavor profile is world class - perfectly balanced, quite complex and just the right intensity of flavor and bitterness. The citric flavors of the nose cascade over a dank base. Orange, pear and mango lead as the first wave of biscuit arrives. These shift to tangerine with a bit of rind and a rising dank influence. The middle has a subtle bitterness with both pine and rind aspects which, as they fade, yield the sweetest period for the palate. The finish is a bit dry and slowly fades away leaving a slightly sweet tropical mango and pine aftertaste over a dank background.

Nincs ez másképpen az american pale ale kategóriájában sem, s ahogyan annak lennie kell, valóban kiemelkedő italról van szó a maga nemében, arany színe alatt ugyanis lehengerlően telt, mégis üdítő aromák bújnak meg azok minden virágosságával, citrusos jellegével, melyek az ízében egy természetes, letisztult, gazdag és kiegyensúlyozott szerkezetben találnak magukra. Fűszeres, lime-os jegyek uralkodnak kifogástalan módon egy száraz, mégis telt zamatokkal teli környezetben. Amellett azonban, hogy hiányérzetünk semmi esetre sem lehet, számomra csak annyit nyújt, amennyit egy egykomlós american pale ale nyújtani képes, azt azonban maradéktalanul megteszi.","HUNGARY","adster"

4018,"2016-01-22",4.2,"Pours a clouded amber-golden color with a fluffy big head. After a few minutes, the head collapses to a thick lacing, which is still half a finger broad.

Smells of ripe citrus, together with biscuit malts and a flowery vanilla note. A lemony crispness prevails, producing juicy freshness. A layer of orange rind adds to the citraic richness, pushing its juiciness of the beer, together with a note of resin.

Drinks very soft, while the beer actually has a higher carbonation to it, which gets entirely coated by cream. 

Tastes of white bread malts, juicy lemon and its great softness straight from the beginning. The malts turn sweeter afterwards, while the beers hop profile develops a nice crispness, featuring a flower coated dryness. Finishes with a noteable malt backbone, while the beers sweetness seemingly results from the juicy fruits, orange and citrus. This creating a fantastic, exotic fruit forward finish with a pleasant, malt accompanied dryness, finding its greatness in its balance.

Another hop forward beer, which convinces by its world class mouthfeel and a perfect balance between hops and malts. The hops provide enough punch to stand out from the malts easily, while I find it astonishing that it is possible to create a beer which is that flavorful, while it drinks easy as lemonade. While not being particularly bitter, neither punching my tastebuds, this combines a fantastic fruitiness with well nuanced crisp and bitter characteristics.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Of course Sam sent me this with six Surly Abrasives. It feels like I am about two shipments behind, but will after to wait after the thaw. Was really excited for this one and kind of hesitant that a pale ale could really be that good. Heres to heaven. 

Poured an orangeish, pale, hazy color with two fingers of frothy white head. A few bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Above average spiderweb lacing on the sides of the glass. Average-to-soft retention. (Sight - 4.00)

First thing I thought on the smell was - this is really a pale ale and not an IPA? Got Citra hops, sharp grapefruit, tangerine, tropical hops, bitter mango rind, lime and dank resin. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste followed the nose nicely, getting grapefruit pulp, grapefruit juice, Citra hops, tangerine, juicy orange, tropical hops, mango, pineapple, juicy dank resin and hints of floral hops. Every single taste is pulp. Awesome. (Taste - 4.75)

Medium-to-light body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, juicy, citrus finish. (Feel - 4.75)

This was just an awesome beer. The best APA Ive ever had by a long shot (sorry original Alpine Hoppy Birthday). (Overall - 4.75)

No beer has really done that for me like pseudoSue did. The malt foundation is laid out remarkably. It absorbs all but a little of the Citra hops bitterness and lets mango, grapefruit, orange, papaya, and orange cream shine through. Some touches of grass, pine, cannabis, and evergreen as well.

There is just a hint of a piney resin to let me know there is some good dank hoppiness happening. The flavor is just as incredible. There is a lot tropical fruits, specifically pineapple and mango, the floral hops continue throughout there is a little pine on the back end, which really brings this thing home. The mouth feel is great. Just thick enough with a wonderful carbonation and it hangs around. The aftertaste is great lots of grapefruit and orange.

I have now had 3 of top ten pale ales - liked Maine Beer MO and 3F alpha king  more than this one - but definitely not my style - I see what others find and perhaps this is too subtle of a beer for me - not much aroma - maybe some citrus or mango in flavor - it is NOT hoppy, so that is a positive; but just not that much happening here - a little hops and tart dryness at end. give me a bock please",", Texas, USA","crajun"

Taste is very hoppy with dank and citrusy flavors. Some light honey and just a bit of cracker malt and moderate bitterness. Finishes semi dry. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very nice hoppy character with a light malt backbone. Manages to have a unique hop flavor in a sea of pale ales.","Missouri, USA","jeremyh70"
4018,"2014-08-09",3.9,"On draft at the brewpub. An orangish golden color with a half finger white head that diminishes down and sits around the rim. Smells of citrus predominantly orange, dank hops as it warms, caramel malt, honey. Taste is a sharp floral citrus hop bitter that balances with some caramel malt, honey sweetness that ends with cracker bready yeast and more bitter that sits on the tongue. Unique hop flavors and taste overall. Bought a growler to go.

4018,"2014-07-10",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2014 A huge thanks to Huhzubendahs mother in law for carrying a growler of this from Reds Alehouse in North Liberty, IA. The growler leaked at the high altitude, so there was a barely noticeable loss of carbonation. Still an amazing experience to have this, a huge thanks to Matt. 
Pours a clear light orange color with very small particulates floating in the glass. Carbonation is active, and the half inch head settled relatively quickly to a wispy rim head and light spotty lacing. Aroma is pleasant and earthy: sweet hop resin, citrus with notes of tangerine, mango, pineapple, slight papaya, and mild notes of green onion. Flavor is delicious and all citra. Citrus sweetness, tropical fruit, pine resin complexity. Medium bodied and bitter finish. Delicious and even though the carbonation is slightly deteriorated, it is apparent that this is world class.

A - Pours slightly hazy orange with a nice one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving sticky webs of lace down the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of bright citra hops, light caramel sweetness, fresh cut grass and strong fresh zested citric fruit. Much like Zombie Dust this one is all about the citric fruit.


T - Starts off with the dynamic duo of strong citra hop bitterness and fresh tropical fruitiness slowly being joined by the grassiness and some mild caramel sweetness. Finish is bitter with a bit of light sweetness, lingering for a little while after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Crisp, bitter feel from start to finish. Very easy to consume, even with the added ABV.

4018,"2014-02-09",4.4,"(bottle) Pours a semi-hazy orange color with a medium white head that lingers. Initial smells reveal a predominant scent of orange and mango. This is by far one of the most forward-smelling mango beers Ive tried. Further warming elicits pineapple/banana/orange juice.  Even further warming yields some mint and Evening in Missoula tea. Wild stuff. Flavor is really nice, with an initial citrus explosion of grapefruit, orange, lychee fruit, and mango. The mango really lingers on into the finish, and I can still get tastes of it while exhaling. The usual suspects of pretzely/crackery malt or stinging bitter hops are absent, and the main aspect of the flavor is an even fruitiness from start to finish. With some warming a bit of the malt character peeks through, but it certainly plays second fiddle to the hoppiness. Mouthfeel is medium with a little heft, and the carbonation is spot on. This has to be one of, if not the, best pale ale(s) Ive ever had. Nice job, TG, Ill certainly be buying this again.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

4018,"2014-01-01",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2017 I guarantee if these ratings were split between Florida cans and Iowa bombers/draft, this would be much higher.  If youve only had this in a can, you havent lived.  Every veteran Ratebeerian that rates this 4.5+
 had it from a bomber.  Night and day difference.

Update:  Another growler from Casanova, 2 hours after fill.  Aroma is off the charts - dank, melon, citrus, pine.  The taste on this stays so smooth and drinkable, with a mellow kick up front of this wonderful dank melon citrus combined with a dry grassy rusticness.  Its greatest strength is how it maintains a friendly drinkability while staying flavorful and interesting.  Just shy of perfect because I think my ideal beer would be an IPA version of this beer - almost identical but with slightly more vibrancy and intensity.  I cant imagine a better APA than this.  Drinkable to the extreme.  I could drink a growler of this in about 5 minutes.  
Another growler from Casanova, less than 4 hours after fill.  This is the 7% version, which TG had said is a one-time deviation from the 6% standard.  My new rating is a combination of both experiences.  Pours a hazy golden orange with giant white head that fades to a film leaving a curtain of great lacing down the glass. Aroma is a tropical fruit bomb, dank with mango, tangerine, and fresh-cut pine mixed in.  Taste follows suit with more tropical fruit, pine resin, and slight grassy bitterness.  It finishes clean and the bitterness ends mildly, leaving you ready for more and making this relatively sessionable, especially for 7%.  Palate is medium-light bodied and smooth.  Maybe Im just a sucker for Citra hops, but this might be my new favorite beer.  10+5+9+5+19=4.8  (3/4/14)
Growler from Casanova in Hudson, less than 24 hours after fill. Pours a clear golden orange with lasting white head and perfect lacing. Aroma is plenty of dank citrus with grass, pine, and pale malts. Taste is a bold continuation of the juicy citrus, with some bitter pineapple, pine and grass up front. Then, just enough richness from the malts to keep it from being overly resinous. Finishes juicy, then bitter, with lip-smacking pine resin. Crisp and ideal bitterness, with the aroma assisting all the way down the glass. Best APA Ive had, and most nuanced lower ABV beer Ive had.

4018,"2013-11-19",4.0,"In short: A very dry fruity-grassy-piney blonde pale ale.
How: Bottle 22oz, consumed fresh one week after receiving it from mcberko, thanks a lot Matt.
The look: Slightly cloudy orange-blonde body topped by a small white head.
In long: Highly aromatic hoppy nose with plenty of the usual tropical and exotic fruits that I get from Citra IPAs but this one has is a little less cat urine and a little more dry grass than more Citra IPAs Ive had. Body is lean and crispy with an active carbonation. Malt backbone is very very crisp and with a very low sweetness sensation. Feeling of crackery cereals, dry biscuits, dry hay and dry straws. Then fruity hops (tropical, exotic, citrusy) with sundried grass and pine-cones. The hops fruitiness has a fruit skin character. Short bitterness of medium intensity. Too dry to be considered really refreshing but the drinkability is through the roof. Something almost attic-rustic in the dryness character of the beer. I loved that beer.

Aroma is full of tropical fruit including a ton of pineapple and light grapefruit. Hints of tropical fruit. The fruitiness is balanced nicely by a large amount of hop resin and dank pine and herbal notes.

on the bitter side to be sure, but not like super bitter or anything like that. leaves a dank resin bitterness and pink grapefruit and mango on the mouth. higher booost up on the bitterness scale than trillium or hill farmstead hoppy pale ales. i gotta say it lifts and benches. 

quite complex for a hoppy APA. tight hop character. fun beer. finish can be relatively bitter and drying. smashes the old pallat on the head.

Traveling out to sample the releases from Toppling Goliath I started with this fine pale ale. Full of flavor but not so abrasive that it becomes tiresome this is a beer that could be drunk all night long. If it ever gets bottled be sure to grab fresh versions for yourself.

Aroma / Appearance - The caramel cloudy base sticks around with a thin white head. Grapefruit, lemons, and citrus are bright and grassy. The balanced nose lends it the air of a spring morning in the woods.

Flavor / Palate - Bright bitter hops sparkle on the tip of the tongue. An orange driven transition sweeps the flavor profile towards a dramatic and rosy finish. Creamy sips glue it together from the first sip to the final drop. This is a fine beer that makes me think Toppling Goliath is more than just hype.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4018,"2013-05-11",3.9,"Pure Citra pale ale? Yes please! A bit light on body but I guess that's the style. Blasts my nose with fresh, juicy hops. Taste backs up the smack it talks. Bit of hoppy bitterness at the end amidst the deliciously malty & hoppy base. Reminds me of Zombie Dust, and that's impressive.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

4018,"2013-04-09",4.8,"Pours a light orange with nice tight foam.  The citra hops really come through in the aroma, lots of grapefruit and tangerine.  Again the citra comes through strong in the taste, but leaves room to play with the light malt notes.  The finish leaves you with more citrus but is very clean.

Overall: A

My recommendation: You dont necessarily have to wait for the bottles to arrive, (hopefully 2 months?), bars and restaurants around Cedar Rapids and Iowa City continually have TG brews on tap, or make the trip to Decorah and get it as fresh as you can. These guys are the real deal!","Iowa, USA","iabeerguy"

4018,"2013-01-28",4.6,"Served with a huge, fluffy, foamy, frothy, off-white head that lasts a while and plenty of lace. Color is a slightly hazy & dark amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is a startlingly fresh hop, reminiscent  of weed plus some sweet malt, citrus, resin. Flavors much like nose, bitterness stands out; just enough malt and carbonic tang to balance for a kick butt IPA. Body and carbbonation are faultless. Finiish is like flavor, long, and drrikable.

4018,"2013-01-02",4.1,"On tap at El Bait Shop. Super fruity. Pineapply. Not surprisingly for a TG brew, there is a  light simple hay malt profile that lets the hops shine.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"
4018,"2012-12-18",4.1,"Ok, its time to rate this.... been too busy sucking it down to take notes apparently.  
Pours a hazy light golden color with a big white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass.
 
The beer is ridiculously aromatic, its dank and piney and grapey and just very hop forward. Its a very appetizing aroma. 
 
The flavor is very hoppy and fruit forward with a little bit of yeastiness. The beer is basically dry and very hop focused with a moderate to high level of bitterness... 
 
I dont know, my rating makes it sound like a boring generic IPA, its really not... its pretty damned good. Sometimes I just suck about writing about beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
4018,"2012-12-17",4.1,"Draft. Pours a nice slighlty hazed golden color with a white head that leaves sticky lace on the glass. Nice citrus note in the nose. Medium mouthfeel. Orange rind sweetness that then turns to a drawn out rind bitterness note. Some florals as well but most of the flavor is orange, grapefruit, and melon. Very nice IPA.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
4018,"2012-11-07",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2014 Tap. Pours hazy golden buttery amber with a small white head that dissipates with nice lacing.

4018,"2012-10-03",4.3,"On tap at Dexters Pub. Pours an unclear orange with a fine white head; nice lacing that lasted and lasted. Aroma is so completely floral and citrus hops (hello citra!). Very lovely. Taste has sweet pine, bitter citrus and a lot of sweet caramel malt back. Very well balanced, much more so than the aroma would lead to believe. Finished medium long and heavier to the sweet side than the bitter, but with some of each. What more would you want from a balanced IPA - hop forward, great citra and solid caramel back. A nice one!","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
4018,"2012-08-19",3.6,"Enjoyed at GTMW 2012. Pours a cloudy golden color with a scant white head.  Smells of hops and autumn but the taste was not as hoppy as the smell. It was light and clean with an aftertaste of hops which quickly dissipated.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","rbfishstick"
4018,"2012-08-13",4.0,"Draft on tap at Dexters Pub (Madison, WI). Pours a richer hazed orange amber hue, dulled colors, gentle glow beneath. A frothy white head atop dies to a thicker ring, laces ok overall. Aromas are rich Citra hops, grapefruit and melon, tropical fruit. Lemons, florals, grass, with a deep bouquet of grapefruit coming on strong. Bit of pale malt, bready, but this thing is hopped vibrantly. Initial is lighter end of the fold, bodywise. Good moderate bitter hop flavor shows lemons, florals, and grass. Soapy qualities, with dry bitter hops. Some bready mellow malts, fruity elements, and a firm bitterness. Citrus, touch tropical and soapy. Not as vibrant as the nose, the middle pushes some tropical fruit, melon. Fruity, the backend offers some firm to stronger lingering bitterness, soap, and florals. Dry bready malts, Fruity Citra elements. Soap, florals. Pretty solid, the nose really is spectacular, the beer is solid and quite drinkable. Fresh, big nose, perhaps a bit underwhelming when you compare the rest of the beer to that nose. Nice, bitterness takes bigger jabs at times up front. Flavors seem much more mellow than the nose would lead one to believe at times though. Highly recommended, regardless.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
4018,"2012-08-10",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2015 Pre-GTMW at Dexters.  Great Citra showcase.  Slightly hazy orange.  Beautiful mango/pine/grapefruit aroma.

4018,"2012-05-31",4.5,"Wow. What a great beer! As one whos had his share of IPAs, I find it hard to be bowled over by yet one more IPA--but this is not just one more IPA! The first thing that hits you is that glorious nose of grapefruit and herbs, and the flavor and the mouthful live up to the promise in that first impression. Proof that an IPA doesnt have to be over the top in ABV or IBU to be truly satisfying. I wish I lived in Iowa where I could have access to this regularly.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","Gmku"

4018,"2012-03-21",2.8,"Had on tap at tasting, poured into 4 oz glass.

Appearance -cloudy yellow with little head.

Aroma--lots of grapefruit, grass and hop.

Taste-- very bitter to me, almost ammonia-like.  Tasted like the smell of cat urine--to me anyway.  I work at a vet clinic so this is commonplace smell for me.

Palate--dry, good carbonation, lightly sour on the back of tongue.

Overall, I didnt care for, many other patrons had pints after the tasting.  Just cant get over the ammonia I smell in the beer.","LaCrosse, Wisconsin, USA","Efeswasmy1st"
4018,"2012-03-14",4.3,"[On-tap at Toppling Goliath, and from growler] Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Huge tangerine and blood orange explodes from the glass. Outstanding, and exactly the hop profile I love to see in IPAs. The taste has lots of grapefruit, a subtle herbal quality which shows up after awhile, and just enough of a malt backbone to support it. Medium mouthfeel, and a long finish. Overall, I was impressed with this beer at the brewpub, especially since it is brewed in Iowa. When I had the growler of it while camping though, it put it over the top as one of my favorite IPAs. Very, very solid.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

Pours hazy, light golden color, white head, good retention and lacing.  Fruit dominates the flavor profile as well - grapefruit and mango are most prominent, a touch of resin, nice light malt profile with a touch of background sweetness.  Bitterness is firm but hop flavor stays at the forefront - no astringent bitter aftertaste.  Light - medium body and carbonation.  Another great APA - keep em coming.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"

Tons of citrus on the nose, with apricot and floral hops rounding it out. Super pungent. Nice and light taste, dominated by floral/herbal hops. Carbed up a bit too much, and a bit light-bodied, even for an APA. Liked this one a lot.

Update (7/2/13) - Drank two pints of this at Jaqs on Monroe last night. Beautiful looking beer, lots of citrus and garlic/onion dank hops on the nose. Pretty dry taste, with pale malt that lets the hops shine. Its dank and citrusy. Really pungent and awesome. Bumping up from my initial 3.7.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
