Slight alcohol warmth, toffee and rich caramel flavors. An excellent example of a Scottish ale.","San Diego, California, USA","jlong1965"
1304,"2017-02-12",3.9,"On tap at Oceanside Ale Works, pours an opaque deep dark burgundy with a small beige head. Aroma brings out rich caramel upfront, followed by toffee and bready malt. Flavour is massively malty, with heaps of caramel upfront, followed by toffee and some dark fruitiness. Nicely constructed. Rich and sweet, but not cloying. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1304,"2015-08-05",4.6,"At a party in Oceanside. Was told aged bottle, cork n cage, no label. Someone was trying to impress me saying it is not available. Whoop de doo. Not impressed, but super impressed by the beer. Yeast pack sediment on bottom of bottle. Poured slowly and clear dark dark red. Aroma of all big malts, no roast all caramel toffee and some slight brandy sherry going on. Big rich mouth feel light carbonation. Finishes very malty with light alcohol heat and balance of light brandy wine.","Nevada, USA","mel4vegas"

1304,"2010-11-17",3.8,"Draft. A hazy amber beer with a thin orangey head. The aroma has strong notes of caramel combined with medium notes of alcohol and bread. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of caramel, combined with medium notes of malt, bread, and alcohol, leading to a sweet caramel finish. Like liquid candy.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1304,"2009-09-15",3.7,"Hand bottle from wetherel (thanks John!).  Pours dark brown with tan head when poured from a distance above the glass.  The initial aroma was very interesting...a lot of fruitiness, perhaps cherries, along with pure caramel.  As the beer warmed, there were some roasted malt notes along with some nuts in the nose.  Taste is very malty and sweet; more fruit in here too, though more on the raisin side.  A bit of tanginess appears as well; not sure if thats some the cherry I noticed before or something else in there.  Gotta say, I wouldve never guessed this was 11%.  More like 7% based on the way i was downing this thing.  Glad I didnt really read the stats on this one beforehand.  Very sticky on the palate and finishes sweet.  This was a very good offering, and thanks again John for giving me a tick from a brewery I wouldve never looked at previously.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
1304,"2009-07-27",3.7,"On tap. Almost clear amber with no head. Very sweet caramel aroma. Extremely full-bodied with hardly any carbonation, pure caramel and brown sugar - never cloying though. No bitterness at all. Liquid candy. 080709","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
1304,"2009-07-23",3.2,"From tap at the brewery. Pours cloudy dark brown with a fully gone head. Caramelish and slight metgallic malt base flavoured. Light yeasty. Sweet and fruity flavoured with a distinct malt presence. Light spiced and herbal base flavour. Sweet and fruity finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
1304,"2009-05-03",3.7,"12oz handbottle from wetherel.  Pours brownish red with a tan head.  Nose is sweet and malty.  Taste is sweet and malty and alc is hidden pretty good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
1304,"2009-04-17",3.9,"On tap at the brewery.  Rich malty aroma and flavor.  Dark brown color.  Thick creamy head.  Molasses, raisins.  Some alcohol, but generally well hidden.  One of my more favorite OAW beers.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
1304,"2008-05-22",5.0,"An awesome beer, that has a great malty flavor.  A very High Alcohol content but you cant taste the alcohol in it.  It is very smooth and crisp and refreshing.","Carlsbad, California, USA","BLButler08"
1304,"2008-02-07",3.0,"On tap at the brewery 02/02/08.  Poured a dark mahogany with no head at all.  Carbonation was so low in fact that something may have been off with the tap line. That being said the aroma was minimal with a hint of toasted character, some smokiness and a warm, dry alcohol scent.  The flavor of the beer was dominated by malt and the alcohol was well hidden.  Not as much of a smoked peat character in the background as is usual for the style.  Have to say I was a bit disappointed as I typically love this style of beer.  Not bad, but not exceptional.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"
