1233,"2017-06-03",4.2,"12floz bottle ($10/four-pack, no apparent freshness date) poured into a tulip glass. Rusty-brown body with a 2-3 finger head that is very slow to settle. Smells really good, like subdued candied sweet potatoes. This isnt a spectacular ale, but it is very good. Its full in body, yet not heavy. Its definitely yeast and malt centric. Raisin, sweet potato, tobacco, and molasses play well together with an unknown (allspice?) yeasty flavor adding to the melting pot of flavors. A fine beer that finishes without any lingering qualities.","","balloonbuffoon"

1233,"2017-02-25",4.0,"Brilliant appearance, reddish, a bit dark, hazy, nice lasting tan head. Dark fruit in the nose along with a bit of yeastiness. Taste is initially very clean, then a bit of caramel and dark fruit, and the yeast, a bit of banana at the end. Mouthfeel is neutral, small fine carbonation, a bit sweet, but finishes quite dry.

1233,"2017-02-20",3.8,"Pours from bottle a murky copper-chestnut, with appearance saved by a dense café au lait head, about 1½ fingers, that sticks around with nice lacing and cap.
The nose is undramatic, primarily malt, toast and yeast, but clove note begins to come through. Thats more prominent on the palate, which also develops dried fruit, biscuit and a broader spiciness with cardamom and white pepper joining the clove. Theres a hint of nuts and earthiness leading to an attractive herbal finish.
A touch of creaminess complements the medium body. Overall, not quite Belgian, but very nice on a cool evening.","","Pumpkin87"
1233,"2017-02-06",3.9,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy reddish copper/light brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, banana, bubblegum, peppercorn, clove, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/chocolate, and herbal/yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready/light roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, banana, bubblegum, peppercorn, clove, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/chocolate, and herbal/yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate yeast spiciness and light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, banana, bubblegum, peppercorn, clove, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/chocolate, and herbal/yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready/light roasted malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from carbonation and yeast spiciness as well. Medium-high carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, a mild warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian dark ale/Doppelbock hybrid style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready/light roasted malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink for the ABV. Pretty much perfectly balanced between yeast and malt flavors; with impressive complexity from both yeast and malt as well. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

1233,"2017-01-15",3.6,"12 ounce bottle - $3.79 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a hazy, medium-toned amber-brown body with an inch of thickish, long-lasting, light beige head.

Smell: Toasty baked bread with a coating of darkish caramel. Chopped dried fruits swirled with spirits. Slight, sharp clove and cardamom notes convey some spiciness.

Taste: Sweet and bready with a golden syrup, caramel quality. Quickly regains the phenolic spiciness from the aroma with a sustained flavor of cracked clove. Fruity tastes of bananas, red berries, plums and dates. Slightly herbal on the sweetish, warming finish with the clove lingering into the aftertaste.

1233,"2016-12-10",3.7,"Bottle. Head is initially large, creamy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is hazy medium brownish-amber. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, cookie), lightly hoppy (herbs, flowers), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of banana/gum, raisin, clove, orange peel. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety/creamy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Most closely resembles a Weizenbock, which was my first thought when I took a whiff right after pouring. German Weissbier yeast and Belgian yeast strains often produce similar aromas (banana/gum, clove), and that is true here. Blinded, I would definitely guess that style (and this is an ale yeast, yet another good reason to call this a Weizenbock as opposed to Doppelbock). Nice yeasty tartness that you usually get from that style too. Lovely tightly-packed tiny bubbles that last to the end, along with the hazy body make for a perfect appearance too. Another winner from Ommegang. Falls just a bit short of 4+ wonderment, but its a very solid beer in all respects.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Medium plus body and fine carbonation. Smooth and well-rounded. The flavor is more a Abbey Dubbel rather then a German Doppelbock but it is good.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

1233,"2016-11-28",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2016 Four-pack of slender bottles. Nose very sweet and forthright with its fruitiness -- cherry and very bright orange peel, close to a Belgian ester profile. Pour deep caramel out of the neck but accumulates to glowing ruby in the glass, supports a large and fluffy beige head. Body medium but light, still heavily malty with lots of melanoidin development and pumpernickel crust, though everything remains subject to that slightly fumy fruitiness. More plum, some roast and earthy-treacle character near to scorch, dash of air but no more. Gets decent lace and might even see some legs. A very nice subdued nuttiness (walnut? pecan?) than lingers in the long, light-medium bitter aftertaste. Medium-strong clove and phenolics in general, strong spice blend. Quite nice, classy, complex, but hard to shake the idea its a Rochefort 8 clone rather than a Doppelbock. [2016.11.28: 3.8]
