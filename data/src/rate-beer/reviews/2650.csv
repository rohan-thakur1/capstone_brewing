A wonderful, heady aroma of earthy coffee (with just hint of green pepper), minor cinnamon, heavy biscuit, and a touch of hot whiskey rises up from the glass and only becomes more enjoyable as the beer warms. Pours flat black with a paper-thin tan head. The coffee flavor is slightly vegetal but a decent cinnamon level (moderate spice) that pleasantly lingers carries it away.

2650,"2016-02-27",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at the 3rd Annual Barleywine Tasting at Traviss house on February 20. 22 oz bottle, I didnt get the vintage. The pour of this looks awesome. Its a dark, dark brown with a thin cap of light brown head that falls to a collar, leaving a couple legs of lace. The aroma is spectacular. There is a nice bourbon up front, but then a lovely coffee rolls through. There is a ton of cinnamon and a surprising coconut. I definitely didnt see that coming. There is a little barrel, a light vanilla, and a decent char. Fremont wins. The flavor is a little more focused on the cinnamon, but its still got a good complexity. The coffee and the sweet caramel are nice. There is a bitter coffee roast on the back end that almost makes me think of an imperial stout. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a soft velvety carbonation and a lingeringly sweet malt that finishes with cinnamon and a little bitter. Its just complex and great.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

No pun intended. Well.. maybe it was. Definitely more cinnamon than coffee. Huge cover up on the base beer. Good thing the cover flavor is very tasty.

2650,"2015-07-13",4.2,"Bottle (22 oz). From Lurkaholic, thanks! Split with the Québec & Trois-Rivières crew. 

Appearance: Dark brown (almost black) with a small but thick tan head, good retention and little lacing. 

Aroma: The nose is really intense and decadent with a burst of fresh coffee (but not vegetal), loads of cinnamon, deep caramel presence, bourbon, vanilla, rich dark chocolate, nutmeg... super complex and surprisingly cohesive. 

Taste: Taste is rich and sweet without being cloying with again loads of coffee and spices (mostly cinnamon) supported by a good malt backbone, rich caramel, chocolatey notes, oak, vanilla, bourbon and alcohol. 

Palate: Full body. Moderate to medium carbonation. Oily mouthfeel. A bit less ""full"" than the fantastic mouthfeel of the bourbon & coffee version of their dark star. Warming finish. Lingering spiciness. 

Overall: I have been really impressed by Fremonts big beers lately. This was mightily tasty and really cohesive considering everything going on in this one. Very good stuff!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

The booze is more apparent in the flavor, leading a charge that consists of graham crackers, cinnamon, fruity coffee beans, toasted oak and yogurt raisins before a roasty finish. A creamy medium body carries these flavors well and carbonation is kept minimal -- present, but not distracting. Alcohol content is noticeable, but thats not surprising at 11 percent.

2650,"2015-05-22",4.2,"Yes. Ive had this bottle for months and had a couple or more people waiting patiently to find out what I thought of it.  I open the bottle with my snifter close at hand, and fill it with a thick, creamy, dark-chocolate liquid; the cap rises a rich, hot chocolate-hue as I pour. Even the thick, rich head cant inhibit a titillating aroma like this. Cinnamon, almost baked in, and not harsh, or gritty; a deep, soft bourbon accented with an aroma of vanilla before it becomes just an accent; the coffee wafting upwards in tantalizing undertones as I breathe deeply.
I cant help that brews like this remind me of a deep, desperately passionate kiss. Forgive me my few moments alone with my first taste from the glass.
Sigh...Its as creamy as it looks, a touch sticky, soft and rich on the inside of my mouth as I pull another mouthful. The cinnamon is usually such a deterrent for me, harsh and a bit violent; here I am enjoying every drop; every sip is enhanced with maturity and grace. The cinnamon, coffee and vanilla in this are not just additions...infused - yes. Ive seen that on a lot of bottles, but it isnt actually true most of the time.
This beer drinks like passion, breathes decadently, and for me, the greatest taste in a beer...umami. Damnit, I love it; the savory, sultry experience delivers absolutely my favorite olfactory and gustatory orgasm. My suggestion, if you havent had this...buy it. Buy it now and wait...drink not so fresh and enjoy the fuck out of it.","USA","lightbias"

And with one sip, this beer glides into one of the top 10 beers Ive ever had in my life. No hyperbole here. This is so fucking good. The barrel imparts that vanilla coconut flavor without an emphasis on booziness like a lot of these types of beers have. There is a light alcohol burn, but its not harsh, just right. I get cinnamon, but its just a hint. I really dont get the coffee, other than the roastiness present that might have come from said coffee. The other strong flavors might be smothering it. Mouthfeel is velvet, carbonation on the low end of average for style, body full. So good. Even though I wish there was more coffee presence, this is as delicious as beer can possibly get, so Im not gonna dock it. This is how its done!

2650,"2015-01-17",4.3,"Thanks Sebastian (sebz on talkbeer).
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a nice dark brown coloring with a thin finger semi-white to off-white head. Once it dissipated, a fairly nice looking lacing appeared gracefully sticky and slight.
The aroma had a sweet to nicely spiced smell. It intertwined nicely weaving through the cinnamon and bourbon barrel and giving off a semi-smooth woodiness I could only hope for more again some day.
The taste was spectacular! Holy wow through the sweet light chocolate and emaculate cocoa flavoring gracefully intertwining in a sticky fashion over my taste buds. A sweet sticky aftertaste leads to a fine semi-dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body leaning to a fairly good sipping quality about it. Sticky yet smooth spice rolls over my tongue.
Overall, this is an exceptional brew. Ho-lee Cow, seek this ratebeerians!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2650,"2015-01-16",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Chris. Nose is an amazing light chocolate and toffee explosion with a hint of booze/vanilla and cinnamon. Smells like a million dollars. Pour is dark brown with a large light brown head, lots of tiny velvet like bubbles. Taste is a rich toffee with spiced coffee and a moderate vanilla character. Holy cow this is good stuff. Vanilla really starts to come through as you sip it but the cinnamon is always there like a balancing bitterness. Coffee is like a complimentary chocolate at the desk of a hotel, small, nice, neat, well packaged. finishes semi sweet but still making you want more. Alcohol becomes evident after a few more sips with a warming sensation. very smooth","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
2650,"2015-01-15",3.4,"22 oz. bottle, pours a deep dark brown / mahogany with a medium tan head. Nose is rather nasty to be honest, with vomit, cinnamon, and spice. Flavour brings out notes of coconut, cinnamon, and coffee. Rather messy, with notes all over the place. No where close to the classic Bourbon Abominable. The coffee is upfront, but the spicy cinnamon takes over after leaving everything else a distant memory. Interesting beer, but I prefer the base big time.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2650,"2015-01-15",4.0,"Bottle - Lots of coconut and chocolate notes. Deep brown with a decent brown head. Cinnamon, dark malts, sweet grains and a roasty sweet finish. Quite nice, I liked it a lot.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2650,"2015-01-14",4.1,"22 oz bottle. Many thanks durwoodx for bringing this back. Pours a clear dark brown with a tan head that moves to the edge and leaves thin sugary lacing. Aroma is big and sweeet: cinnamon, bourbon and vanilla sweetness. Flavor is same, with cinnamon leading all aspects. The coffee has proven difficult to find. Alcohol is masked better with this version than regular BAA. Medium to full bodied, muted carbonation, sweet bourbon roast finish. Solid and delicious.","","RussianDragon"
2650,"2015-01-14",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2015 Served alongside Bourbon Abominable. Dark brown body with a small beige cap. Grandiose cinnamon aroma followed by bourbon and vanilla. Spice and booze. Brown sugar and bourbon. Hard to compare this to its counterpart, as they are vastly different. Coffee character is overshadowed. This is a showcase for cinnamon, and while the flavor is tasty, this is definitely best split a few ways. Yum.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
2650,"2015-01-11",4.2,"On draft at the brewery. Dark pour, almost black, with a thin tan head. Sweet milk chocolate, silky, vanilla bean, brownies, nicely done cinnamon, wood, bourbon, and more smooth chocolate. Silky mouth feel, and the cinnamon is not over the top and works very well with this beer. Excellent, but I think I like the regular bourbon barrel slightly more.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
2650,"2015-01-09",3.7,"Draft at Beer Authority, Seattle. As C-bomb (ugh). Big, dark and lots of cinnamon that Fremont does so well. Rich aroma, body a little less so. Vanilla and cinnamon spiciness. Rich but missing something in body. I like this a bit more than the usual bourbon abominable.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
2650,"2015-01-09",3.8,"Tap at the beer authority.

Dark pour, obviously. Cinnamon and vanilla nose with some roast. Flavor brings toasted marshmallow with vanilla, a mild fairly cinnamon, roasty chocolate. All together it works quite a bit better than b-bomb did for me. Though I am admittedly rating this from a much smaller sample, even the first sip of b-bomb put me off whereas this first sip was quite delicious if somewhat sweet and over the top.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2650,"2015-01-02",5.0,"Beautiful balance among bourbon, chocolate, roast and cinnamon flavors. There are no chilis in this, but the cinnamon is very assertive and drying, and the over all effect is quite similar to bourbon barrel aged Abraxas, but even more drinkable. Seek this one out, or trade heavily for the chance to savor it.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"
2650,"2015-01-02",3.9,"Black with a chocolate head. Aroma is coffee, bourbon, booze, cinnamon, dark fruit. Full bodied, lightly sticky mouthfeel, nicely integrated booze. Taste is chocolate, bourbon, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla. Yum","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","GothGargoyle"
2650,"2014-12-29",4.2,"22, capped and waxed. Pours a murky dark brown with a dense and creamy tan head. Big sweet nose, showing a dense melange of caramel, brown bread, molasses, dark roasted coffee, soft cinnamon notes, and a bit of fruitcake. Creamy thick body, almost sticky, soft carb. Great interplay between all the sweet notes on the mid palate--caramel, molasses, nougat, treacle, coffee, cinnamon, but amazingly its never heavily cloying or overpowering. Its an after-dinner sipper or cigar beer to be sure, but very coherent and approachable. Lovely beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2650,"2014-12-27",4.4,"This was delicious! A lot of care went into this beer. Poured wonderful with a nice dark caramelized head that left nice lacing. Tasty imperial stout that paired well with the warming cinnamon, and really tasty oaky bourbon that complement the stout nicely. Would recommend buying 2 one to lay down for 9 months and one to drink","Washington, USA","chuckstout"

2650,"2014-12-20",4.0,"On tap @ Fremont. Pours dark inky brownish black with thin oily dark mocha head. Aroma is big buttery cinnamon on top of the regular roasty dark malts and bourbon of BBomb. Taste is similar, the oaky bourbon barrel-aged dark malts dominate, strong zesty cinnamon note follows. Coffee is present but definitely overwhelmed by the big bourbon flavors here and the cinnamon addition. Tough to argue with the results, clearly it works here.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
2650,"2014-12-13",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2015 Draft at Fremont earlier today. Pours clear dark brown with ruby highlights, just like regular BBomb. Aroma: Light coffee roast at the front end which gives way to the usual BBomb flavors (chocolate, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, etc.) and topped off with a thick dose of cinnamon. So, you know, basically what it says it is. Taste: Moderately sweet, decadent, rich; the cinnamon is big, reminding me of a pumpkin-spiced bourbon chocolate syrup. Side-by-side with the standard BBomb, the flavor intensity on this one is stronger. Palate: full body, silky smooth, viscous with soft carbonation. Overall: if cinnamon/coffee is your thing, this is great -- well-integrated, doesnt detract from the original. In my book, theyre both pretty equal from an enjoyment perspective, just different flavors.   Update: when I had this last, it was a beautiful December day, the last day of the quarter. It was sunny and in the 50s, and I was sipping this out on the patio at the brewery with friends while eating fish and chips. It was a great day, and the beer was nearly perfect. Tonight I finished a small glass thanks to Matt, and though the beer is still very nice, its closer to a 3.9-4. I wont knock the rating down or anything, but I wanted to comment for completeness.   bottle shared by BeBeau. Ill be damned if this isnt better than I remember it. Coconut comes into play. Damn. Yum. Bumped to 4.3.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
