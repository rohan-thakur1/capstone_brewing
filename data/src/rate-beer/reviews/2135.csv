2135,"2016-03-26",4.3,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled April 19, 2013. Originally reviewed 8/19/2013.
Very pale hazy body with a huge white head. Lasts forever.

Wow. Aroma is spruce and pine. White wine. Blended seamlessly. Acidic.

Spruce is again incorporated very well in the taste. Pale malts. Sourness piggybacks the spruce. A bit of sweetness in the finish. White wine is more muted, but comes back in the aftertaste.

Medium heavy. Well carbonated. 
 Easily one of the most unique beers Ive had in a long time. Really good and like nothing Ive had before.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

2135,"2015-06-16",3.7,"750-ml bottle. Nice funky aroma of oak, sweet effervescent cola, white grapes, and a touch of herby mint. Light yellow pour. A slightly tart light lemon flavor is prominent first before giving way to complex notes of juniper, mint, an odd menthol heat and a very faint spicy bite of rye and black pepper. Heavily carbonated. Its probably the best example of the sahti style Ive tried.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
2135,"2015-05-14",4.2,"Contents under pressure! The cork popped off with a thunderous boom.
Highly carbonated. Bright sunflower-yellow, hazy, beneath three good inches of snow-white foam like whipped egged whites. Amazing aroma. It peppers the nose with lemon peel, pear syrup, grapefruit, spruce, mint. A bit of wild funk in the back. Complex flavor: peppermint, spruce, lemon drops, alcohol, pine. Potpourri-like, as in a perfume. Spices swirl in the front while a Belgian sweetness -- pear or peach -- rises in the back. Sweet menthol finish with an interesting bit of sweet corn and a smack of lime. Whipped medium body. I get some menthol burn on the tongue with the smooth, silky bubbles. Alcohol burns the nose and throat -- you notice every bit of the 10 percent ABV. Complex, interesting and unique. Near perfect execution in terms of look, feel and flavor balance.","","PartyFowle"

Lemon-lime spritz, light acidity, spruce tips, hay & straw, a hint of tart lacto, vague spiciness, some old rotten pineappley Brett, a touch of sweaty barn funk. Lots going on. Wow, sour flavor! Much more tart than expected. Nice lemon, lime, & citric bite with each sip, crisp green apple skin, a hint of acetic acid, some funky hay, & brettanomyces. Possibly just a little over carbonated, pretty prickly mouth feel. Sharp, dry, light bodied. Reminded me more of a saison, really.

Unusual but very good.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
2135,"2014-07-19",3.8,"Bottle... Pours mostly clear and yellow with a mid-sized, fizzy, white head. Good, creamy, tight retention. The nose is so spicy and unique - smells almost like earthy, piney hops are used here, but the style doesnt call for anything other than a bare-bones hop bill - if any at all. Instead, bread yeast and juniper twigs are used to spice and balance this historical style. History lesson completed. So anyway, this brew is medium-bodied with champagne-like carbonation and the flavor is mildly acidic with a note of dry white wine and a light level of funkiness. Finishes, crisp, tart, and then dry. What a strange, enjoyable brew. History in a bottle. Kudos to newcigarz for popping the top on this baby!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

It poured a golden yellow, quite bubbly, with a lasting head leaving nice lacing. Oilier than I thought it would be based on appearance. The taste had much depth, very layered and hard to pin down. Some earthy dank like rotting flowers, crisp apples, citrusy hops came out. Quite bitter but sweet enough not to be mouth puckering. You can definitely taste the spruce in this one. Pretty much like drinking a rotting forest next to an orchard. A great beer but pricey and not an everyday affair for me.","Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, CANADA","BrewGoblin"
2135,"2014-04-30",3.8,"A soft pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four finger thick, pale, off-white colored head that leaves quite a bit of lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is an amber color that shows a hazy, orange-straw hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells tart, grassy, lightly herbal, a bit woody, with a straw leaning, pale grain aromatic notes, and a bit of berry like character that is definitely juniper leaning.

Softly full, with a tartness that isnt quite as much as the aroma would suggest. Soft, dried hay like, wheat cracker flavors contribute to the texture which is a bit creamy, but has a nice prickly carbonation that adds a bit of textural contrast. A soft woody note here melds in with pale grain character and the finish has a light juniper like note to it. The finish has an herbal, woody, juniper note to it that adds a very smooth bite to the finish. The juniper adds a hint of something that is a bit like wintergreen, though not really, but it is softly pervasive, and distinct from any other woody note that I have noticed in a beer before.

This beer drinks exceedingly easy for its strength, the alcohol is quite well hidden. A bit better than I was expecting, Ill admit that I was a bit turned off by the listed alcohol percent, but it is hidden quite well and this is quite enjoyable.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pours into a HOTD tulip looking just like a local IPA. Deep copper, near-to-white head. Smells like spruce, mint, and ass. Wow, this is really an off-putting aroma. But the flavor is not nearly as bad as the aroma suggests. Its hugely medicinal, reminding me of the Douglas Fir Eau de Vie from Clear Creek. Sweet rich malts around the edges, lovely spiciness, giner and thyme. Full mouthfeel...and after a few sips Im starting to like it and think Ill even be able to finish my half-bottle. We drink, we talk -- and this beer is totally grows on me. From the free-jazz cacophony of flavors a melody starts to emerge and Im grooving to it. We near the end of the bottle and Im very sad to see it go. I completely acclimate to the aroma and fall hard for the flavor. I stretch out the last few sips. I share perhaps less than I should. I really like it. The alcohol goes to my head in a very pleasant way. Yep, I could see sitting around in some frozen Finnish wood drinking this with the natives.

This is growing on me. I mean, the aroma makes me gag a little, but now that Im used to it I could see drinking this in a remote part of Finland and then missing it when I returned home.

Looks like a toasted ginger ale. Smells super complex - mint, thyme, spruce, pine oil, soil. Flavor is tart, spicy: some lemon, unripened appple. Medium bodied with sharp carb and a semi dry finish. Love it.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"

2135,"2013-11-22",3.5,"Bottle @ GTs house. Clear golden pour with a white head. Aromas of lemon, grass, and lots of spruce. Juniper berries, brine/saltwater, and a touch of white vinegar. Really herbal. Flavor is fairly tart and a bit salty. Lemon juice, juniper, spruce, and woody herbs. Saltwater, mild vinegar, and a light bitterness.

2135,"2013-11-10",3.6,"750mL thanks to brainlair! Pours a clear, bright golden with fizzing out white foam. Nose is pretty intense fresh forest, resinous spruce tip, camphor, sweet tomato, sharp juniper. Taste is quite intense with spruce tip resin, near chemical in taste, but about as successful as you can expect for a funky, high alcohol, spruce sour of sorts. Palate is effervescent, bright. Doesnt allow the high abv detract, though I dont see a reason for so much alcohol for this style. Would be just as good at 4-5%.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

2135,"2013-10-14",4.3,"Bottle at Baileys Taproom in Portland for $24. Enjoyed at 65F in a snifter.

A - The appearance is straight apple juice with a minor head that fades very fast and remains thin. 

S - Nose is pretty complex. Theres a mix of brett and this acidic fruity grapefruit punch. I get oak and melons. Very much a funky tropical treat that smells pretty damn fantastic.

T - Damn, this is special. It is sort of in a class of its own. Well, Im having a hard time describing taste and am thus filling this section out last. honey, rye, sweet caramel, candied apples, cantaloupe and other melons, pineapple and a big woodiness that I only get from Hill Farmstead saisons. The sweetness is persistent but not overbearing, the woodiness is like chewing on tree bark but I dont feel like Im a fucking woodchuck. Spruce tip ONLY hits you at the end of the beer. You get it for a second and then it flees away quickly. I get a very yeasty bread taste that pairs so well with herbal funky brett. There seems like a bit of lactobacillus but it never overpowers you with tartness, just sort of chills out in the back ground. What in the Hell am I drinking?

M - Moutfeel from the bottle conditioning is velvety yet explosive. It has a champagne like mouthfeel with the complexity of the best belgian saisons. The most persistently sticky bubble situation on a mouth swish Ive ever achieved. like the bubbles in my mouth last for days and never stop. This is going to be a burping beer for sure.

O - The total complexity of this beer is mind-blowing. I must have more of it. MUST RIGHT NOW! I hope more of this makes its way into Vermont. The price is high but its an impressive beer. EDIT: I did give this a 4.7, bumping it down to a 4.3. sadly, its a lot of beer and more than a glass is insane on the palate, the burps and the drunkenness. If this came in at 5%, Id be all over a perfect 5 rating.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
