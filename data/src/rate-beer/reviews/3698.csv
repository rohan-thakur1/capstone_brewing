3698,"2014-04-25",3.6,"The beer starts malty-dry. Hints of roast. The mainpart is dry-fruity (cherries, plums), nicely bitter and a bit dusty-dry. Cereals but not pushy. Interesting combination, a bit ""red"", smooth. Hints of dry caramel, slightly bitter till the end.  Very interesting, a bit like a ""special grain"" brew. Nice! --> 12/12/12/12","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"
3698,"2014-01-28",3.7,"500ml bottle from Redmonds. Chestnut brown, foamy off white head, doesnt last. Smoke, toasted malt notes, nuts, leather, hints of coffee in the aroma. Lovely. Simple toasted, nutty malt notes up front, a little chewy chocolate followed by more roasted nuts toward the finish. Medium body, tight carbonation, a little fizzy. Long complex finish. This is really good.","Dublin, IRELAND","ciaranc"
3698,"2013-12-08",3.7,"Not sure why this is labeled an Irish Ale, which usually means a reddish, bready malt beer, because this is really more of a Brown Ale in my eyes. Copper to brown color, aroma is of sweet to bready malts, large off white head that dissipated quickly. Carbonation level meets the expectation. Taste is of a well crafted brown, malts are forward with this beer, slight dark fruit notes. Hops are evident at the end, some pine, not getting citrus however. Finish is wonderful, very easy to drink.","Cloneen, IRELAND","beerfest5"

Taste is a fabulous roasted malt with a nice tartness to it as well, smokiness and a touch of hops. Lots of flavour. Very enjoyable.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
3698,"2013-03-20",3.4,"Dark chestnut brown with cream head that soon collapses. Fruity sweet butterscotch nose. Diacetyl and caramalt sickliness held at bay by astringent dark malt chocolate and roast. Makes a change to usual Irish reds.","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"
