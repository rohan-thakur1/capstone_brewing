Really starchy aroma, yeah, thats a dortmunder/helles. Is it macro. Woh, salt and vinegar crisps - clear sodium diacetate. Taste is milky porridge oats. Finish is starchy, pretty buttery too. Imno fan of this family of lagers, and this is not a particularly good example in this state. This was right at its BB, and I can believe that a fresh one would be way better.

Aroma is malt-dominated, but with a clear fleshy fruitness, little hay. Body is light to medium, with a lively carbonation to make it refreshing and pleasant. Gentle in flavours, but not neglecting them, rather bringing out the beauty of what a lager can be. Palate continues the light malt flavours, gushing down with some water without getting thin. Extremely pleasant throughout. Very smooth and round experience. Superb!","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","anstei"

4278,"2014-01-10",3.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2015 Vom Faß in der altmodischen Brauereigaststätte an einem ruhigen Vormittag im September 2013. Ein paar ältere Herren unterhalten sich mit gedämpfter Stimme oder lesen Zeitung. Es ist so ruhig wie in einem guten Café. Diese Franken sind wirklich ein angenehmer Menschenschlag ... - Das bestellte Bier schimmert goldgelb. Der Antrunk ist schlank, ausreichend gehopft, nicht süß. Leicht grasiger Hopfen. Schwach rezent. Mittlerer bitterer Nachtrunk. - Ein grundehrliches, enorm süffiges, harmonisches Bier ohne besonders hervorstechende Aromen. Wiederholung: Flasche (50 cl) von Hopfen & Malz, Berlin. - Helles Goldgelb, klar. - In der Nase brotige Malzsüße, etwas Banane, kaum Hopfen. - Antrunk mild süßlich hellmalzig, Weißbrot, matte Fruchtigkeit ohne Herbe. Hopfen ist nur ansatzweise zu erahnen: ein Hauch von stumpfem Gras. Durchschnittlich rezent. Im Abgang ganz schwache, ein wenig schale Herbe ohne Pep und Aroma. - Vom Faß vor Ort war dies Bier ein Gedicht; aus der Flasche ist es eine ganz andere Geschichte, nämlich ein fades, unterdurchschnittliches Helles ohne die wunderbare Süffigkeit und kernige Hopfung, die fränkische Biere auszeichnet. Dazu paßt die Verwendung von Hopfenextrakt, die das Etikett einräumt. Bestenfalls 2,4. Meine Bewertung hier ist ein Mittelwert.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

4278,"2013-04-08",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2013 Draught at Witzgall in Schlammersdorf, Nov 2012: Lustrous golden. Creamy and pasty white crown of foam. Pleasant nose of honeysuckle, lilac, pepper, lemon, minerals, fresh baguette Pils malt, new-mown hay, and a fleeting glimpse of fruitiness and lager yeast. Soft body. Stiff and tight carbonation. Firm hop bite trails a succulent kiss of malt and a well-defined flourish of toasted bread. Quite zippy with a strong mineral dimension accompanying the tightly structured malt base. Ample peppery zing exudes beneath the soothing Spalt-drenched nectars. Obscure lemon verbena herbalness adds intricacy to the refined hoppiness. Malt is sublimely clean and flawless within the lean frame. Squeaky clean, yet lip-smacking at the same time. Finishes crisply toasty with edgy baguette notions paired with appetizing dabs of vibrant flowery softness and a poignant yet teasing pepper aspect. A thoroughly enjoyable and dangerously quaffable helles (finished my 8 oz. pour within five minutes) that does everything flawlessly as it toes the line with extraordinary finesse and delicateness. I would feel blessed to have the fortune of drinking this liquid gold every single day. Good heavens is this clean!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4278,"2013-01-20",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2015 Witzgall Vollbier Helles, draft at the brewery in Schlammersdorf, a noon start to the days bike ride involved this simple but lovely crisp and clean lager.  sharp, clear gold body with a hugely-rocky head, I dont know how not to give this a five, its a swimming pool of fluff.  yeah.  pretty straightforward pale malt sweetness (honey, crackers) and light edel hop nose (spice, dried grass, fruit cocktail) with a smacking, crisp finish (minerals, sweet corn, minor apple juice), mostly clean. quaffable and delicious, a very good helles, but quite basic.   continued down the road to Hallerndorf where we found some of the best lager around from Lieberth.
May 2013: Clean, minerallic, crisp, lightly sweet, medium to low bitterness.  subtle spalt lemon spice aroma hops.  toasty, clean, quiet malt flavor.  nut oils and cracker-y toasted malt.   

March 2015: Tangy, minerally, malty, bright, carbonic, lightly peppery, more hoppy than I remember: lemon-pepper-spice hoppiness. Super tangy and fresh, malty and perfectly clean, bright and juicy and oily, fragrant and lip smacking, hoppy as shit without much bitterness. Lovely fucking beer. Honeysuckle and flowers come to mind, and something like banana candy, which confuses me, but its not esters, seems malt-derived.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

4278,"2006-05-23",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2014 Impressions from the hof:
-Golden clarity benefits but from a veil of head.
-Fresh cereal and toast politely entice.
-Effervescent carbonation is still softer than the usual gassed up lager, but evokes a frail body in this particular case.
-Simple-minded maltiness is still effective.
-Finishes softly, with whispering hop bitterness.
-This doesnt evoke Franconian lagers at all, strangely enough.
