1488,"2017-01-04",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Coconut, vanilla and chocolate manage to sculpt a few raisins in this creamy dessert of a brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the darkness.
-Sweetness levels are high, but nothing you cant handle if you are in a dessert mood.
-Carbonation and residual sugars are perfectly aligned, building a voluptuous mouthfeel.
-Chocolate gains traction with time, superceding the vanilla on my palate..
