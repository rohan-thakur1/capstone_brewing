342,"2017-04-16",4.3,"2013 vintage bottle [at Ryans during 2016 and again at As Is 2017]. Pours a deep, hazy orange body with light wispy white head.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied; both soft and bright with a nice balance between the fruit character, oak and general sourness; additional notes of lactic funk, grapefruit/pomelo, soft wood flavor towards the back end, sour lemons and farm funk.

Golden orange, translucent and hazy, big foamy beige head. Aroma is cider, mixed apple, some oak. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste follows aroma with tangy soured fruits, cider, mixed citrus, oak, not that acidic at all. With air it gets more of a fruit salad / fruit pastilles vibe in the aroma. Nice.

342,"2016-12-31",4.2,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting Kyle finally made it to at Mickeys on December 01. 750 mL bottle, 2013 sticker. The pour is as nice as you could hope. There is a light hazy golden yellow with a thick white head and some soapy lace as it falls down. The aroma is tart and sour citrus, funky barnyard, a light oak, a hint of brett, but this is just so balanced and delicate. The flavor is just as good. The light and delicate complexity I just love. The funky barnyard isnt as heavy, the citrus is heavy and sour, there is a light dusty hay that just beings it all together. The mouth feel is a little softer than I was hoping. The carbonation isnt as bright as I would like to see and the aftertaste is good, lingering funky sour fruit skins. I like this one.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

AROMA: Mellow, citric, cheesy.

TASTE: Incredible, INCREDIBLE. Comparable to the standard gueuze but oakier, more mellowed and balanced. Everything I get from the standard gueuze is just amped up yet somehow so much more complex. I could compare this to a 8 year vintage gueuze I drank recently.I would love to see what time can do to this.

PALATE: Sour but not overpowering. Carbonated but not overly so. Funky yet clean. Complex!

Bottle, courtesy of a chill br, shared in a location remote of my living room. 
Pours a hazy gold with a small but respectable head. 

The aroma is funky & earthy with some light lemon, some oak, and a bit of animal sweat. Its got some hay & distinct barn yard aromas. 

The flavor is lightly bitter, nicely tart with some lemon peel. Its got some musk melon and bright citrus. Its defiantly got a bit of that cheese rind thing happening. Although the brightness, dryness, and white grape defiantly evoke champagne at times. 

The beer is sharp and slightly less lively than I normally expect Gueuze to be, although the beer is carried well by this mouthfeel.

342,"2014-09-04",4.7,"One of the three luxurious Lou Pépé lambics from Cantillon, different from the rest of their products by the subtle use of sugar, not for taste (because it is eaten by the yeast completely), but to keep the refermentation going in a very subtle and extremely well-balanced way. This geuze is a bit different also because it exists only of 2 years old lambics (three different ones, if I remember well). Off-white, loose and unstable head, colour warm golden orange, clear but hazy after adding the deposit. Complex and not too agressive, rather sedate lambic aroma, sour apples, grapefruit, white grapes, dry sherry, wet straw, oak, sulphur... Very refreshing in the mouth, elegantly sparkling like champagne (or good old geuze), grapefruity, very delicately sweetish at first but lemony sourness in the middle, finish very long, dry, appetizing and complex like an old dry sherry.

My second Lou Pepe up for rating, been looking forward to this! :-) Pours a cloudy hay-hued light orange body with a medium, fizzy and short-lived head, which is reduced to a tiny (yet long-lasting) ring of white foam. Aroma is intense, near-pungent bretty stable tones and apple vinegar, with hints of cellar must, bees wax, honey and floral sweetness in the back. Very little tartness, compared to the regular Cantillon geuze. Taste is dense tones of stable funkiness, dry near-tart floral hops, citrus peel and bees wax...or honey...at least, some dense, semi-sweet carpet of taste forming steadily in the back of each sip. Or, not really sweet but rather like a shadow of former sweetness, as if some ghost of the fermentable sugars was retained in the bottle, post-fermentation. Strange, and rather delightful.

Taste is rich and probably as complex as it gets, every sip is a different note, stunning. Strong funkyness again and tartness sorrounded by a sort of yogurt-like sweetness. Huge citrus and lemon peel notes. Grassy notes in the background. Some wood and fruit too. Mostly dry finish. Palate is creamy, silky, with good carbonation."" I couldnt say it better now. Great geuze. This demonstrates that JP Van Roy can be as good as Armand at blending if he wants, same complexity and funky/citric profile that makes 3F geuzes the best. I know the A4 series comes from a particular situation which drove prices up. But when considering pricing and availability, Lou Pepe Gueuze has to become my new favourite geuze. Simply outstanding.","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"
342,"2012-03-12",3.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/7/2011.  2006 vintage. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Thanks to readbaron for bringing this over for Dunts birthday tasting.

The pour is a pale golden straw color, hazy, with a traditionally soft gueuze head. After a few minutes no head is left. 

Light malts, lots of sour tangerine, lemon zest, and grapefruit. Soft faded barnyard funk in the background of the nose. 

Light malts, lemon zest, grapefruit, some barnyard funk and a lot of oak contribute to a very tart flavor.

The body is on the lighter side of medium, with gentle carbonation. Tart and acidic. Leaves some sour residue behind my lips. 

The age on this beer has clearly added to the robustness of the flavor. Unfortunately, the flavor is a little lighter than I would want from a gueuze.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
342,"2012-03-06",4.3,"2008 vintage (bottled 2011) - Thanks Dave!  Pours a hazy orange with a thin layer of white head.  Leaves a few patches of lacing.  The nose is filled with the classic Cantillon sour urine aroma.  Lots of citrus and a hint of acetone.  Vanilla infused oak and oranges.  Lovely sour citrus aroma.  Light maltiness in the background.  The taste consists of hay and citrus sourness.  Super smooth vanilla oak creaminess.  Very floral.  Essentially a smoother, more floral, version of the Classic gueuze.  Body is smooth, slightly slick and almost creamy.  For a young bottle this gueuze is already packing a nice sour punch.  Carbonation is right on.  Overall, this is excellent.  An extremely well executed gueuze.  However, the Classic is typically easier to get and just as good in my opinion, if not better depending on the age and vintage.  Now I just need to try one of these with a bit more age on it.","New Hampshire, USA","sisuspeed"

342,"2011-03-31",4.2,"2007 sticker 2009 cork date. Its always fun to pop open a new gueuze from Cantillon because if you love lambics and gueuze, you know youll be somewhere on the scale between good and completely awesome. Unfortunately this time this beer was just good to me. :(

Beer was quite heady, forcing the cork out of the bottle with little encouragement. Beer is yellow and pretty clear, the head falls away leaving some lacing on the glass but not much. Carbonation is moderate, the head falls away eventually. Looks good.

Aroma is milder than I was expecting. Its sulfury and slightly funky with some lactic and very mild acetic notes.

Beer is thin and moderately carbonated in the mouth. Its mildly acidic, mildly citric and lactic is the winner here. This is some oakiness and funk to it. Its not as good as the classic gueuze, which I suppose I should be happy about since this beer is more expensive and harder to get but I was just expecting more. The comparison of the Lou Pepe Kriek and the 100% Kriek lambic is nearly universally agreed that the Lou Pepe is much much better. This beer, in my opinion, does not improve from the base. Still, its a good gueuze and another good beer from Cantillon.

Pours a hazy light golden orange with a small frothy white head that recedes to a swirl and collar quickly.  Little lacing to speak of.

The aroma is fantastic and complex with apricots and pears bringing some sweetness with a bit of acidic tartness.  There is an emerging earthy funk that would certainly grow over time though it currently takes a back seat to the fruits and acidity.

The taste starts out with the vinegar which puckers the mouth a bit before the light, sugar-coated pears and green apples come in.  The finish is dry and very oaky with the barrel character making its presence felt.  The barnyard funk is more prevalent in the taste as well though its still not dominant.

A - Slightly hazed golden tangerine color with a large bubbly, foamy white head with decent retention leaving a thin layer of lace with some patches.

S - Lighter and sweeter than what I was expecting. A lot of apple along with the tart/acidic smell. Reminds me of an apple cider or apple vinegar. Some sour/tart grapes and hints of barnyard aroma.

T - Like the smell, this was a bit lighter and less sour/tart/acidic than I thought it may be. Thats not to say this doesnt have those but they seem a bit more balanced when compared to the fruity flavors. Strong tart and acidic apple and pear along with a base of sour grape. Citrus and barnyard flavors come out but it isnt really all that funky compared to others in the style I have tried. On the finish there is definitely a tangy and tannic white grape kind of feel. At the very end I get a bit of a kick of wheat as well.

M - Medium body with a healthy level of carbonation. Has puckering and drying effects, but for the style this is quite smooth.

D - Very drinkable, especially for a sour. The mellow taste (compared to other sours) make this much easier to drink and drink more of it. 

Notes: 2007 Gueuze, bottle on 12 October 2009. This is a fairly mellow sour with the flavors much more in an equal balance with the fruitiness. This still is a sour beer, no question.

The taste is classic. Its gueuze when its best. Mild and agreddive at the same time. Its incredible balanced between the sour and the sweet notes.

Fruit is sharp/astringent citrus. Whoa, sour/funk dryness coming through in the flavor. A nice blended brew. I shouldnt have smoked a pipe before this. Charred wood and funk are dominating. I hate to say it, but this beer doesnt have too many dimensions, as I was expecting it to have. A nice Gueuze, but I i wish it had more depth, and for $20 this should be expected.

Golden orange with quite a big off-white head with good retention. Good lacings as well.

Nicely edgy but very well composed funky smell. Notes of clean bretty aromas, horse blanket, aged cheese and mud. Grass and mild tart fruit notes. Lemon juice and perhaps a faint hint of mint.

In the mouth, a quick acidic punch is followed by a massive funky brett character. Pleasant citric notes, grass and apple rind. Lots of barnyard and horse blanket and hints of aged cheese. After a while in the glass, the funkiness dominates almost completely. Gently husky wheat character. The finish is nicely dry with a considerable grassy bitterness, a hint of stomach acid, funk and minerals.

Medium body with very tingly carbonation. Refreshing and very easy to drink.

A really good one. A complex and very funky gueuze. Not very acidic considering the brewery behind it. Its actually almost too easy to drink - it seems like it looses character after a while, as if the acidity mellows out.

Thanks to buffalohead for sharing a 2002 vintage of this at Mikes tasting a week ago.  This was well received and has aged well the last seven years.  Cantillon seldom makes a beer that disappoints and this is no exception.  The only thing preventing me from drinking more is the $20 price tag.

Aroma / Appearance - The golden hazy body was a result of the bottles yeast getting mixed into the base somewhat.  Oranges and lemons combine in a sharp tartness that is typical of a top notch lambic.

Flavor / Palate - Lemony and bone dry it sucks all the moisture from the mouth after only a few seconds.  Tasting like moldy blue cheese left in the toe of a sweaty gym sock it has that perfect sourness a great lambic should.  My only complaint may be a slight flatness (even for the style) but regardless it is top notch.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma was amazing, slight, zesty citrus with grass, hay, tart fruits, pears, earthy, a little malty, meyer lemons, white grapes, with plenty of Brett coming through early and often.  Flavor is similar, the wild yeast complexities come through nicely and the marriage of flavors is more reminiscent of a pricey bottle of wine rather than a pint of ale.  Flavor has more of the grass and hay, more earth, lemons, grapefruits, spice, white pepper, white grapes, lemon-lime soda and sweet tarts.  Soft, a little chalky, with some slightly zesty bitterness lasting in the mouth.  Wish I had a case to age in my cellar because it’s clearly progressing well.  I’m not a big sour/geuze fan but this was one of a kind.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
342,"2008-10-15",3.9,"2007 bottle, with weird crap on it that smells awful.  pours a mostly clear golden amber with a thickish off-white head that fades quickly.  mmm what a smell.  lemon and orange citrus zest, with a sort of earthy/woody/grassy character that reminds me of a forest on a cool fall day.  a hint of mustiness, and that sharp sour cantillon funk.  a bit more mellow, though, than others i’ve had from cantillon.  less fruity and citrusy in the taste, with more of a wheat-like flavor coming out, mixing well with the light malt.  a bit of straw and barnyard hang around, and the lemon finds its way in at the end.  sharp sour finish, until you get used to it, at which point you notice a light bitterness and a lingering dryness.  great mouthfeel - slightly oily, thin enough to be quenching, but never watery.  spritzy, as the bottle says, but the carbonation is so little, it doesn’t add much.  more mellow than i’m used to from cantillon, or from any gueuze really.  it still has that biting acidity, but it’s toned down.  great stuff.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

Medium crisp clean powdery feel with light gentle carbonation.

The smell reminded me of fresh squeezed lemon juice or a cider made from green apples.   Taste was very dry and sour with no hint of any sweetness that might have ever been present.  A little bit of hay and cheddar were apparent in the taste as well.  Despite all this acidity and complexity, it was smooth and refreshing, and not harsh at all.

342,"2006-03-14",3.4,"750mL, bottled in 2002 and shared by Muzzlehatch on 3/10/06 at cellar temp.Rusty copper, quite deep for a gueuze.  Immense, off-white head, is quite frothy, not overly dense and is retained very well thanks in part to the large amount of bottle refermentation.  Some light haziness and quite a layered appearance, with pencil-yellows and bright golds all swirling about.  Lacing is quite prominent in strands, all down the glass.The nose begins with a predictable Cantillon funkiness.  Large helpings of raw, old cheese; complex lactobacillus bi-products and a lovely rustic ""farmy"" quality.  But dusty...very dusty (dry, bland-like yeasts) and an emergent plant-like note (celery, broccoli and/or rhubarb stalks).  Even forgiving that, what I find, as it warms is a large amount of ""powderiness"" that I find in poor examples of the style (though this can be anything but).  Powderiness like you are smelling powdered sugar mixed in heavy mineral water.  It really gets up front in the aroma, and though there is a delicious acidity and funky quality lying behind, I can not help but be turned off by this plant-like and powdery note.  Due to this, the usual strikingly clear pedio/brett nose that I love from this brewer is not there, or at least, very interrupted.The flavor follows suit, with a powdery/plant-like note that is disconcerting and really rears its ugly head.  Behind this is the lovely, musty, oily/oaky and dry yeast note, both sour and refreshing.  Invigorating carbonation, a bit too lively at first, but easily becoming appropriate and engaging upon breathing.  Texture ranges from creamy to oily, and the malic acid and such is in full bloom.  No alcohol, of course, and little wheat noticeable.I am fairly convinced that the sugar addition to the bottle accounts for the flavor/aroma note of powder/plant.  It is just seems like too much of a coincidence that ALL of the lambics I have had that have a sugar addition have this note.  And though I understand that the sugar is fermented out, there still can be a residual flavor (though not sweet).  That said, it is difficult to score the beer.  As the beer is not ""flawed"" or ""poorly brewed"", I just dont feel it is appropriate to add sugar to a gueuze in any shape or form.  Other than this, it is a fully refreshing, funky, sour gueuze.  I have also noted this powder/plant note in the Lou Pepe Kriek samples that I have had.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

But as its pulled theres a satisfyingly loud POP and the liquid pours happily into our glasses, beautiful hazy orange-gold with light flecks of yeast and amazingly large and stable heads enhance the beauty of the scene....the nose is quite musty, with dried citrus and a curious wet prairie, right after a rainshower quality, and a surprisingly big sweetness, almost candy note as it warms....on the tongue, its quite refreshing, thirst-quenching, clean and only moderately sour with some citric sweetness towards the finish and very light dried thyme and other herbs apparent....somewhat oily mouthfeel, but only slightly low carbonation.  Not a great Cantillon or perhaps not a great sample, though the bottle seemed upon opening in good shape; this is more an easy drinker than a complex masterpiece and as such it gets a nice rating, but isnt something I necessarily feel like seeking out again.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Except perhaps for the framboise, Im pretty sure I prefer the regulars by a fair margin, they seem more assertive and pungent if not as classy. This was a 2000 vintage. The cork would have led me to believe its a 1990 as dismantled and rusty as the cage was. It pours a cloudy golden yellow with little-to-no head. Pinneaple and grapefruit immediately dominate the aromatics. Very little funk manages to come through, mostly wet socks and a slight cheesy old hops thing. It is dry and tart as expected, but I could not see how this is moreso than the regulars. Tea tannins and wood hints are a constant. A slight biscuity/candy aspect manages to reach the back of the nasal cavities while the citric bite punches the sides of the tongue in a very fruity fashion, dry and astringent. Very soft carbonation, less present than I expected. Medium bodied, rather creamy texture. Refreshing and rather complex yes, world-classic? Not sure about that.. I do prefer many others balance leaning less on citric character than lactic and tartric glory or unadulterated funk.

This was my Christmas present from my in-laws, who bought it a year ago and stored it in their refrigerator--thank you Gerry and Tim!  Happy Christmas!  I started drinking this before the appetizers of Christmas dinner and finished after dessert.  It may have been that since I had had a lot to eat during the day by the time I cracked open the bottle (about 3 p.m.) my palate was already well acclimatized, but whatever the reason, I was surprised not to have been hit by any kind of sourness.  (Although, I have also developed some resistance to gueuze sourness.)  The dominant aromas here seemed to me more fruity than barnyard--honey, pear, apple cider--though certainly there was woodiness and some musty aromas.  Lightly spritzy, on a dark yellow body.  The flavor was more of the same, very dry with some apple and funkiness.  My brother-in-law and wife both tried a bit and loved it, which means it isnt aggressive enough!  Acidity built in my gut through the end of the bottle, but of course, I was also eating a ton of food at Christmas dinner so it is hard to isolate the real cause.  Excellent, top-of-the-line gueuze though probably not a gueuze I will return to again and again when I want a hit of gueuze funk and sour.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

The aroma was soft and musty, possessing scents of apple and lemon, along with the usual gueuze like qualities.

I found this to be very mellow, not like I was expecting. Since it was older, I was expecting it to be much more harsh, dry and sour than the other gueuzes that are blended with young lambic. Just the opposite really. Dont get me wrong: this was dry as hell, but its sourness was subdued quite a bit and it wasnt harsh at all.

The aroma is acetic and citrusy with sour apples, cheese and grape being the predominant smells. The taste is definitely cheesey with grapes, and tart sourness being predominant. The carbonation is mild, the mouthfeel is full and tingling. The finish is unbelievably smooth given the complexity of this beer. Some orange and perhaps a pinch of ginger in the finish.

This is quite lemony and not as funky as some Lambic derivations.  The brettanomyces character is pretty subdued, but there are definite musty-leathery notes here.  A bit of vinegar adds to the acidity.  The beer finishes with a slight tannic astringency, which seems fairly typical.  My only complaint is that perhaps this bottle could have used a bit more complexity.

342,"2003-11-04",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2008 2000:  Foggy pale peach.  Jagged large and small-bubbled white froth.  Relatively softish aroma full of iron, peach, must, chalk, moist earth, and grass.  Very bright and fruity.  Sits gently on the palate with soft, tingly spritz.  Slightly medicinal first impression, followed by  shades of cedar and grass.  Concludes with a nylon sack, table grape, and peach skin edge alongside mild pale malt husk remnants.  It lacks the hallmark Cantillon musty, sharp, and farmy qualities, but it’s nonetheless another brilliant creation from these people.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Flavors of wood,leather,old malts, iron,and dried grass. Fairly fruity and sweet,nice combo. Finish is pleasently acidic,dry,and freshly bitter(lemon rind type bitter). As it loses carbonation becomes dangerously,drinkable. Thanks for the hook-up John.","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"

Very refined, subtle lambic flavour, again, of leather, horseblanket, lemon, sour apple, though with an underlying sugarcane-like sweetness. Finish is refreshingly tart & dry.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"

Medium citric grapefruit, yeasty and milder bitter flavours. Lifting slightly sweeter finish and aftertaste.

342,"2003-08-11",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2006 Venerable lambic yeast and vulnerable dried apples...Surprising, noble balance for Cantillon, so lesser lemony acidity than the regular gueuze...The incarnation of smoothness and reverend, oncoming bacchanalia...3.9/5

A 2002 bottle was crushed in a blind gueuze tasting we did with 17 other gueuzes and near-gueuzes...This one was dusty, possessed no intriguing aroma at all, was obviously not a blend of different vintages, but did not offer much complexity at all...Hops were even perceived, which let us to believe in the wildest incarnations of this unknown substance in our glass...Not worth the cost at all, definitely not considering the fact you can get their regular at half the price...3.2/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

342,"2003-05-25",4.5,"Bottle #4 of 120: Has that deep internal golden orangey glow that some Fantomes have; very creamy long-lasting head which I thought was unusual. Excellent aroma; softly wooden, flowery, lemony. Very dry yet strangely refreshing. Lots of dirty diaper aromas, nowhere near as sour as other Cantillons I've had; big bodied firm palate; smooth and delectable but seems to be missing something. Still a classic - reminds me of the smoothness of that first Lindemann's Cuvee Rene 1994, which completely blew my mind. Thanks again to Kevin.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
342,"2003-03-01",4.5,"Colour: golden with orangey shine; thick, white head, quite even, slowly disappearing; beer continues fine, pearly bubbling.
Nose: Woody, tart (yes - even in the nose), lemony, lemon-flower or lemon-scented (dry) tea; slightly sulphury.
Taste: tart, drying, tannins. Citrus zest, green apples, meaty flavour too. Fades ever so gently. 
Aftertaste: Dry tartness keeps lingering. Strange impression of sweetness appears, probably due to disappearance of acids in the mouth - orange marmalade without the sticky sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Absolutely dry (tannins) effect on front teeth and tongue. Slight burning throat effect.

It is impressive how active this beer is, as composed from old (2yr.) lambics only.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
342,"2002-12-26",4.2,"1999 according to the label, bottled (or ""botteld"" on the cork) in 2001. More expensive than Westy 12 ($35 for 750 ml). Not numbered (although there is a label pasted over another label on the back on the bottle, so there may be more information below). Typical Cantillon seepy cork; the liquid under the crown cap smells like apple-cider vinegar. Nose from the bottle before the pour is cidery, but not vinegar. Medium head, lots of carbonation during the pour but not once settled, golden body, rather hazy. Nose is slightly musty cider. Head recedes to a couple of millimeters after a minute or so. A lot of body for a gueuze; almost chewy. Muted sourness, very smooth. This has a funky undercurrent that is hard to characterize. Very soft for the style. Leaves a sour cheesiness on the tongue. Im amazed at the body of this one; thick and silky; almost like a gueuze with the mouthfeel of an oatmeal stout. Somewhat woody. The biggest flaw is that its so smooth that it doesnt have the biting front that I like from a gueuze. I can feel the acid in my stomach already, though. Pretty interesting, although, considering the price, I wont be sampling this often.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"

Cheeses and petting zoo memories in the nose. Super complex without any tastes really dominating, including the sour notes! Superb gueuze made from 2 year old lambics that are handchosen by the Grandfather of the brewers family.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"

Original 2001 rate.  Earthy and sour, but not as much as the brewerys other gueuzes.
