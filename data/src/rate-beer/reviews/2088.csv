2088,"2016-09-25",4.0,"Growler from Tree House, into a tulip glass. Pours heavily hazy milky light orange, medium white head fades quickly and laces well. Aroma is clean floral notes - passionfruit, lemon rind, light citrus. Taste is crisp, lightly juicy citrusy hops; floral notes of lime and mango stand out. Dry and clean on the finish, slight bitterness lingers but otherwise clean with very light mouthfeel. Loads of hops and opaque appearance leave this unidentifiable as a blonde, no complaints here. Incredibly rich and flavorful for a sub 4% abv beer, I cant recall any session beers that came close to this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
2088,"2016-09-08",4.5,"Canned 8/4/16, drunk 8/11 and another on 9/8/16.Incredibly hazy, multi-layered sunset hues, predominantly rosy-peach, with a white head atop showing strong retention.Fresh sliced pineapple rises up immediately out of the can. Light mandarin orange adds juicy sweetness as well, with a subtle Galaxy spiciness/dankness in the background. Succulent, honey drizzled peach emerges quickly, as the malt mixes with the fruitiness of the hop. Impeccably clean and with no resin or alcohol whatsoever. Not as much watermelon as I usually get from Tree House, but Eureka doesnt give that off as much as their IPAs do. Not as intense and lush as their IPAs, of course, being all of 4.1% but the aroma is still delightfully persistent and encompassing.Lovely pineapple-tangerine in the flavor is juicy as hell but also cut with a light graininess from the malt. Soft, but not to the point of reducing the crispness on the end. Very light bitterness, enough to balance, but the light citrus and pineapple does all the work here, with just a touch of spiciness from the hop lingering. Key lime, melon, guava, pretty much any tropical fruit you think of can be imagined in some form here. Tight carbonation, no alcohol, no flaw. Just a knockout. Some day, not particularly soon, I will be able to buy this in a store near me. That will be a good day.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2088,"2016-08-09",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2016 16oz can. Pours a hazy orange gold. Aroma of pine and mango. Taste of much the same. Watery initial taste of tropical fruit, bread, and light pine turns into a piney hop finish. Moderate carbonation. A thin but pleasant mouthfeel.  Tastes much closer to an APA than it does to a blonde ale.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"
2088,"2016-08-09",4.1,"Thanks Drew.
Canned 08/04/16.
This was poured into a becher pint glass.
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Delicate speckled lacing around the glass.
The smell had sweet juicy citrus over some sweet fresh grass. Light resin. Tropical fruits enter in as it warms.
The flavor brings together all of the previously mentioned aromas sweetly with a delicate bitter to juicy underneath. Sharp bitter rind-like aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation rides nice and low. Crisp sweet to bitter dragging across my tongue.
Overall, my hidden bias might come out with this one, cause it probably leans closer to an AIPA than a blonde by appearance, aroma and flavor, but hey the feel, well, its definitely crushable, hot damn! Hell yeah, Id have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Mango and cantaloupe with a little grass. Just so damn inviting. Taste follows with a huge tropical wall of hops. Mango, papaya, and melons. Finishes dry with some crisp bready malts and a low IBU. Light carbonation and a super low abv makes this crazy drinkable. Not as good as the Citra version but its definitely up there. Eureka kicks ass!","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

2088,"2013-10-13",3.8,"750ml growler dated September 26, 2013. 3.9% ABV. Big thanks to Mark for this treat!

Pours quite hazy yellow with a one finger white head that settles to a small cap and leaves some good lacing behind on the glass.

Aroma is a nice dose of Galaxy hops with fruity notes, tropical fruit and citrus, underneath is some light bready malt notes with a hint of spice. Good strength.

Flavor is more of the same, tropical fruits, fruity and citrusy hops, bready malt backbone, a hint of spice, a hint of alcohol, pretty dry overall with good bitterness. 

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, a little sticky, good carbonation.

Ahhh a nice treat! I love Galaxy hops and they are showcased nicely in this Blonde Ale. Pretty light, crisp and refreshing. Tasty!","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"
