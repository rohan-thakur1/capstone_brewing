1246,"2017-03-12",3.7,"Az Avery következő, mostanában beszerzett főzete egy duplabakként megjelölt, ""imperial oktoberfest lágerként"" hirdetett ital, melynek címkéjéről II. Vilmos köszön vissza ránk, ízig-vérig német jelleget kölcsönözve ezáltal a palacknak. A benne lapuló sör kinézete és aromái is a germán hagyományok mentén haladnak, a réz színű italból édesen malátás, karamellás foszlányok szűrődnek ki. Csemegeszerű jegyek, melyek által a kóstolás egyszersmind rendkívül veszélyes tereppé is válhat, amennyiben a világos italok leggyakoribb buktatói között számon tartható ragacsos illatok kellő támogatás ígéretének hiányában, tartalmatlan, gyengécske testből röppennek fel. Ez esetben azonban ilyesmiről szó sincs, s ilyenkor rögtön felértékelődik a mézes-mázos aromahalmaz: a szerkezet megfelelő alapul szolgál az édeskedéshez. Vaskos malátakötegek között bukkannak fel a süteménytésztás, élesztős, enyhén aszalványos beütésű elemek, majd egy halványan sós, közepesen száraz, fűszeresen komlós levezetés zárja a sort. Mindeközben a kortyok szabása ideális, kerekded jellegűek, nem élesek, tartalmasak, teltek. Nem feltétlenül az én terepem a lágerek világa, ezért csupán óvatosan jegyzem meg, hogy a duplabak besorolás némi fenntartással kezelendő.","HUNGARY","adster"

Flavor profile is ripe fruit and seawater followed by malt and biscuit with a long finish of fruit with a mild but distinctive alcohol burn, giving away the Imperial classification. Not too much though. Medium bodied, slightly sweet and mouthcoating with exactly the right amount of carbonation making this supremely easy to drink for a 9.5% brew. An excellent beer.

Its head fades out quickly leaving just a few stray bubbles on top. The aroma has a spicy hop presence with lighter malty notes and a hint of grainy alcohol. Its flavor starts with its solid malty backbone that has a dark caramel sweetness. A grainy alcohol pops out and gives the beer some bite and its hop flavor is spicy and a little bit earthy.

Aroma - the aroma is spice, alcohol, fig, and raisin
Appearance - body is mahogany in color, the liquid is clear, the head is white and small and dies quickly into a halo.
Taste - heavier sweetness and light bitterness dominate - the caramelized sugars, alcohol, and dark fruit (fig and raisin) and spices are really what is noticed in this brew.
Palate - the body is medium in quality; the texture is somewhat oily, but mostly slick; the carbonation is average in the mouth; the finish is somewhat is long and strong and astringent with an alcohol burn.

Orange colored with a sheet of light cream foam. Smells sweet and malty with a hint of toffee and some tea like character. Flavor is sharper than I had envisioned with hints of anise and peppercorn. There is plenty of malt and sweet malt at that. Medium bodied with sharp carb. This beer is worth trying in a taster tray, not something worth $8/bomber for me.

The aroma of this beer is very subtle.  There is a slight caramel with resin lingering.  However, this is speculative because it isnt very bold in the smell department.

It pours hazier than the style standard, it is a cidre color. Th head is off-white and the lacing is super dirty looking.

The smell has a tangy fruit character, some caramel nut, and alcohol.

The flavor is pretty bad. Super cloying sweetness, rotten fruit, sickly sweet caramel. Huge alcoholic presence.

Pours a moderate caramel color with a half-finger white head and not much of any lacing. Nose brings some caramel and dark fruits along with quite a bit of booze. Taste is overwhelmed by alcohol and brings some dark fruit in the background. A bit of residual sweetness. Boozy, hot feel on a medium body.

1246,"2010-10-22",3.7,"I finally got to use my big glass steins Aunt Sandy got me a year or so ago when I successfully poured the entirety of my 22oz Kaiser bomber into said stein. There were no dimples, but I still felt like I was ready for the biergarten, stein in hand, sausage and kraut on the way. Deep amber-orange, her coppery head fades into a thin blanket while lace proceeds to crawl its way up the sides of my glass to no avail. There is no escape when Kristyn is supping beer; thats alcohol abuse, mind you. Her nose reaches out like a strong-armed fraulein and slaps me upside the head with massive caramelized crunchies and candied apple goodness sprinkled with a healthy dose of cinnamon and nutmeg. For a big beer, there is no readily apparent alcohol heat, and so I greedily revel in layer after layer of red apples and chunky cinnamon apple sauce, melba, caramel crunchies, white raisins, and pears. When holding a stein filled to brimming with beer sipping doesnt come into play, and so my first few quaffs are anything but timid. A creamy sweet mouthfeel greets me fast and sets my tastebuds flying. Melted caramels, toffee, and maple slathered atop succulently stewed apples spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg with a side helping of applesauce and peaches. Besides mingling with her stewed apples, cinnamon lingers long in my breath which is lightly tinged with warm fuzzies. Underneath her sweet first impressions are more crisp apples and golden melba toast. Dry grass and baled hay dries the back of my throat, instigating enough thirst to keep my generous quaffs going at a steady pace. The Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest is dangerously drinkable, and as I near the end of my stein, dried apricots and apples bid me a final farewell.


Not overly complex by any means, she is immensely rich in the flavors that matter most for an Oktoberfest style beer, imperialized or not. I was also greatly impressed by the overall lack of alcohol heat. Im glad they dont serve the Avery Kaiser Imperial Oktoberfest at German(style) biergartens because any more than one and Id be doing more than just eating and drinking.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1246,"2010-08-28",4.0,"I think its great that Avery calls their Imperial series the ""Dictator"" series.  Its a nice play on the imperial style.  Tonight Ive got a bomber of the Kaiser, which bills itself as an Imperial Octoberfest.  22 ounce bomber.  Pulled out my dimpled mug for this one.  Tradition and all.  Pours reddish light amber with a fizzy head made up of small bubbles.  Minimal lacing.  Smell is of caramel and - cant believe Im saying this - peach fruit rollups.  I havent had a fruit rollup since I was a kid. Low levels of carbonation present in the mouthfeel of the beer.  Lends itself to a slick mouthfeel.  The first taste gives you a huge caramel malt body and a gigantically warm alcohol finish.  The lazy description would be to call this a malt bomb and wrap it up.  Thats not fair to the effort these guys clearly put into making this beer.  Caramel syrup and toffee malt lends sweetness.  Hops arent at the front as with most styles.  I get them more towards the middle of the drink, and theyve got kind of a spruce type of flavor to them.  Dried peaches and apricots are there too.  But theyre there only briefly, before more sweetness takes over and blasts you into a warming finish due to the high ABV.  Its nice to finally see this beer back on the shelves.  To me its one of the beers I look for to let me know that, hey, despite it being nearly 100 degrees today summer is on the way out.  This would be a great beer to enjoy in 50 to 60 degree temperates either outside camping or at your local football teams tailgate.

Sweet caramel malts and heavily toasted bread in the nose with a very light hop presence which Im sure was much more prominent when fresh.  Theres a hefty molasses sweetness on top of that.

The taste is more of the same and very sweet with molasses and caramel malts dominating.  The toasted character is there but a little lighter than the aroma.  The finish is sweet with a hint of spices and an alcohol burn.

Looks good on the pour with a deep amber color and a frothy, off-white head.  The head doesnt stick around long, but it is an imperial, so its expcected.  The nose is pungent with earthy malt, overripe citrus, and a bit of boozy sweetness.  The flavor is a jolt of rich, maltiness and balancing bitterness.  All the qualities of an Oktoberfest doubled (maybe tripled!) up.  At 9.73%, it has quite a bit of alcohol as well.  It remains well hidden underneath the earthy malt, orange, and fruit notes.  Full bodied and rich, this is a good after dinner brew that you probably dont want more than one of.  Definitely different and worth a try.

Amber brown with a off-white head that is not the towering pillow of the authentic oktoberfest beers, but then again, this is not your typical oktoberfest beer.   I was skeptical going into this from a theoretical perspective; it seemed like an imperial oktoberfest would simply be a doppelbock.   There Avery goes being silly again.   Well, I have to admit that The Kaiser pretty much nails what you would imagine an imperial oktoberfest to be, while remaining distinctly different from most doppelbocks.   The difference hinges on drinkability.  Yes, it is a total malt bomb, but it manages to be dry any lean enough to still give off some semblance of quaffability that its mother-style is known for.   The aroma is big and bready with a rich dark bread-crust and moist bred-center character.   The flavor delivers all of this malt pretty straightforward with just enough hops to make themselves known and balance the lot.   Full, but with a texture that is slicker than most doppels and lends itself to generous sips.   Pretty straightforward overall, but it does what it sets out to do pretty well.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

The Kaiser is brewed with imported German malted barley, noble hops, authentic German lager yeast and cool Rocky Mountain water which are all intensified to bring this beer to 9.73% ABV. This beer pours a copper color with an orange tinge and a small white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aromas of malt, dried red berries and figs extend out of the glass bringing you classic aromas of Okotberfest marzen styles.

1246,"2009-03-06",2.7,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2012 11 ounce goblet - $6.00 at Taco Mac in Kennesaw, Georgia. 

Appearance: Near opaque, orange-amber body with a small, somewhat fizzy, white head.

Smell: Sweet-smelling, boozy nose of apricots marinating in apple brandy with a background scent of toasted caramel malts.

Taste: Initial blend of caramel malts and hot apple brandy with a charged dose of sweetness. Pinch of crushed, toasted bread crumbs. Plenty of alcohol heat throughout. A particularly distinct spice character transitions into Noble hops with a medium bitterness. Basically, its just more of the same till the finish.

Mouthfeel: A bit above medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Ive made several attempts to find, within me, some love for the Kaiser, but its just not going to happen, Im afraid. Im hesitant to toss out the phrase ""hot boozy mess"", but its pretty fitting. Perhaps its time to for a replacement dictator-themed beer.

A searing alcoholic note comes through on a deep inhale.  Flavors, too, are intensely sweet at first, caramel and candy sugar weighing heavily.  Floral hops and a touch of spicy grassiness lend some semblance of balance, but this brew is clearly malt driven.  A strange vegetal note lingers in the aftertaste.  The alcoholic heat gets to be overwhelming rather quickly, as it certainly isn’t hidden.  A dense, sugary, under-carbonated mouthfeel doesn’t do much to help things.

1246,"2008-09-21",3.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.

Appearance: It has a copper or reddish amber color with a thin and creamy, light tan head. The body has good clarity and some visible carbonation. Its head fades out quickly leaving just a few stray bubbles on top.

Smell: The aroma has a spicy hop presence with lighter malty notes and a hint of grainy alcohol.

Taste/Mouth feel: Its flavor starts with its solid malty backbone that has a dark caramel sweetness. A grainy alcohol pops out and gives the beer some bite and its hop flavor is spicy and a little bit earthy. It finishes slowly with some bitterness from the hops. The palate has a slick heavy texture with mild carbonation.

Notes: The alcohol has a harsh unrefined quality to it, which holds down its drinkability. Overall it is still very interesting.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

Pours a see through burnt orange/red (pretty much copper) with a small, fizzy, white head that dissipates quickly. A little bit of lacing on the glass with a swirl on the surface that remains throughout the session. A plethora of sweet caramel malts in the aroma. Some hints of spicy and floral hops with just a trace of alcohol in the smell. Definitely dominated by the maltiness though. Wow! I wasn’t expecting this flavor after smelling this...much more intense than the aroma leads it to be. Strong and complex sweet malts right away, closely followed by the alcohol taste. A little overpowering, which I kind of enjoy...I was just surprised after not really picking up too much alcohol in the aroma. I know its a 10% ABV beer, but still...a surprise. A rather full feeling beer with a dry and sticky finish. The medium bitterness and oily hops kick in at the end and linger along with the alcohol for a good amount of time. Overall, and in my opinion, despite the almost ""kick in the face"" surprise that the initial taste presented me with, the strong alcohol is balanced very well with the intense malt backbone and the bittering hop finish.

Aroma of caramel maltiness, damp ground and some alcohol vapors. Taste is initially sweet spicy floral hops and caramel syrupy maltiness. Behind that is some nutmeg. Then mid palate is a big slap of harsh alcohol. The finish is boozy and lingers. Taste picks up a toasted quality as it warms, and somehow becomes somewhat more integrated.

Some rum too yet the sweetness is distinctly German in character. Remains quaffable in spite of strength.

1246,"2008-05-10",3.8,"Bottle (22oz.) @ home. Poured a clear, dark amber hue with a one-finger thick head of beige foam that lasted throughout the entire glass. Produced nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was caramel malts and notes f bread and cookies with some wood. The flavor was mild citrus hops (orange and grapefruit), bread, caramel. Alcohol is noticeable but not unpleasant. The mouthfeel was full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Another excellent offering from Avery.","Warrenton, Virginia, USA","ChrisJ"
1246,"2008-05-07",3.3,"Cloudy amber pour with a thin white head. Interesting aroma of caramel sweetness and malt. Flavor of caramel, malt and some hops.

Body Thick and rich
Finish: Slightly acidic. 
Overall: This beer is an avery style beer it is very huge. The one thing that this beer needs is a better finish and a bit toned downed. It was tasty neverthe less.","Idaho, USA","colts9016"
1246,"2008-04-18",3.3,"2007 - A lot of people like this beer a lot more than I did.  I am just a little more traditional when it comes to German styles and I think they should leave well enough alone.  Having said that, this is just another Avery example of pushing the limits and making everything bigger and bigger instead of better and better.

Taste is sweet and full with a cider-like crispness and flavor -- apples, roasted malt, spices, floral hops, and dark fruit make up the bulk of this beer, with a lingering finish containing a few hints of warming alcohol.  An underappreciated gem.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WallyWalrus"
1246,"2008-04-12",4.1,"A deep, even sensual aroma with strong hints of cherry and toasted malt; this is an utterly gorgeous brew - somewhere between mahogany and siena.

The flavor itself is intensely fruity tasting almost like a strong cider but with a yeasty minerality. Apricot, plum wine, and wheat all combine to make this fantastically drinkable.

Definitely a sipper, have with a link of garlicy sausage and home-made sauerkraut.","Minnesota, USA","Elizavyeta"
1246,"2008-04-10",3.4,"This beer took me by surprise. A lot of crazy fruitiness going on in there. Its like some kind of tropical mango shake or sorbet. Oktoberfest style malts are in there (and complement the crazy fruits as well as can be done), you just have to search a bit. Almond comes out a fair amount in the flavor.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"

The flavor really caught me off guard at first, but the more I drink the more I like it. Very sweet and malty at first, then transitions into a  bizarre, but increasingly pleasant fruit flavor, and then finishes with a nice lingering floral/almond bitterness.

It pours a lovely dark golden yellow, very appetizing. Aroma is strong and malty with fruity hints, mainly apple. Flavor is rich and mouth filling, very malty with hints of spice and apple and just a whisper of sweetness. It goes down with just a touch of hop bitterness. Very satisfying.

1246,"2007-11-16",3.3,"2005 edition. Hazy amber in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of toffee, caramel, apricot, alcohol, and floral hops. Flavors are heavy on the bready malts and black pepper, with more apricot and alcohol. A bit of a sherry note... probably oxidation, but perhaps this is to be expected in a two year old bottle. Theres a good amount of hop bitterness on the finish too. Its not really fair to compare this with standard oktoberfest beers, as its more intense in just about every regard. I think it achieves what it set out to achieve.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"

1246,"2007-11-06",2.8,"Bomber.  Poured a deep amber/copper with a frothy almond colored head.  Spotty lacing. Aroma of caramel apples, maybe candy corn and fruit candies-- very ""Halloweeny.""  Sweet caramel  flavor with a noticeble booze presence.  Almost tastes on the mild side of a barleywine or doppelbock.  Some marzipan and candied orange peel notes.  Soft herbal hops which IMO are too timid to support the malt sweetness.  Thin but not watery.  Basically an overly malty OF but with way more alcohol.  Not really my thing.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"

This beer takes on some Belgian maltiness as it warms to room temperature. And it should be served at room temperature, like an ale.

I didnt know what to expect from an ""Imperial Oktoberfest,"" as I had not tried The Kaiser before, but my first thought on the first swallow was ""bock."" This carries the sweetness and alcohol of a bock in a slightly lighter shell of flavor. As noted by other raters, there is a sour, bready note to the flavor, suggesting then... weizenbock. I then recall Averys Thirteen, and realize that there are some common notes here. Fest-marzens do emphasize malts over hops, and I suppose if you take this to the extreme, you get a beer like this one. I like the idea, and I like the beer for its aspects, but my overall score is a touch low, because the malty sweetness is not in balance. Split a bomber with friends is my advice; you may not get through it yourself.","Puyallup, Washington, USA","truegen"

A massive looking ruby/copper pour with a fairly modest head, the aroma on this one is fairly potent, with a big nut and floral combo.

Copper color with a sweet malty aroma.  The flavor is out of this world.  The flavor is malty and of apples, pears and caramel.   Avery delivers what it promises.  They take a classic style and tweak it to take it to the next level without getting away from the core characteristics of a Märzen.  The characteristics of a Paulaner or Löwenbräu Oktoberfest are here but imperialized.

1246,"2007-10-09",3.5,"Bomber, ABV is 9.37%, cool label: Sugary aroma, lots of sweet malts with a nice floral scent accented by biscuits, and theres a faint soapiness involved here too. Awesome pour, rich amber/copper color with aggressive carbonation. Massive light tan head and a blanket of thick lacing that wraps around the glass. Hearty body with a creamy-velvety smoothness and a low alcohol burn. Overly sweet flavor, initially its distracting. Sugar and bread are the main components. The alcohol is noticed and helps to counter the big sweetness. Somewhat one dimensional. An odd milk taste was noticed here and there, hard to explain. I dont know why you would want to imperialize an Oktoberfest, but this was a solid attempt even if I am slightly disappointed overall. It took a while to finish the bottle. Good but not worth the price tag.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
1246,"2007-10-08",4.3,"After nearly 350 ratings, this is a beer unlike any other that Ive sampled. It pours a clear copper with a creamy/frothy beige head that laces beautifully. The aroma is intoxicating: candy sugar, banana, pineapple juice, and light caramel malt. It smells like a malty tropical cocktail and has very little in common with the typical Märzen. Medium to full-bodied and creamy smooth with a sweet, clean finish that carries just a whisper of alcohol that hides in the background. The flavor follows the nose with a solid malty front and notes of banana, pineapple juice, brown sugar and even more malt with just enough Noble hop bitterness to keep the flavor from becoming cloying. This is NOT an Oktoberfest, by the traditional definition, but it is delicious. Thank you, Avery, for creating such a unique and enjoyable brew.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

1246,"2007-05-16",3.8,"2006 Bottle (9.1%).  Pretty happy about finding one of these in PartyPak, hoping its held up well.  Aroma is a load of caramel malt with good toasted notes and, yes, a touch of alcohol.  Clear copper body with medium carbonation and a medium, soapy beige head.  Body is just massive - loaded with bittersweet, slick, delicious malt.  Alcohol actually gives needed backbone to a style with the potential to be very weak - and then goes a little bit further into burning territory.  But only subtly.  Actually, the heat is nearly indistinguishable from the prickling spice at the back of the throat and lingering into the aftertaste.  Mangled German on the label is EXTREMELY ANNOYING, but the product is good enough - a malt bomb, yes, but a successful experiment.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

1246,"2007-04-28",3.3,"Sampled at a gathering of TN Ratebeerians a couple months ago; thanks to Springslicker for bringing it.  Almost clear orange in the glass, with a fuzzy sudsy white head of medium size and retention.  Smells creamy at first, giving way to some funky bread yeast; in all, reminds me of a biere de garde farmhouse smell in its maltiness.  Thickish in the mouth, warming.  I insisted in my tasting notes on describing it as syrupy, but with qualifiers like ""soft"" and ""not too sweet"" to debase that words pejorative meaning.  Flavors are like overripe fruits (mainly, glowing apricot) in a silo full of year-old maize and Indian corn.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Toasted caramel flavor, a fair amount of alcohol heat, but in the same general direction as the flavor. I liked this. Like Samiclaus, except good. It feels like an idea carried to its logical end, without getting stupid and undrinkable. I enjoyed the ride once, though I cant say this would be a regular pick.

1246,"2006-12-01",4.4,"My work here is done. Tonight is the first night of ""winter"" in Chicago with a drone of storm advisories drowning out a clamor of salt trucks and plows.  Id prepared for this moment hours ago, chilling a Kaiser knowing full well it would be a fitting reward after a cold, wet, miserable day of chores. 
To satisfy the beer nazis who think I shouldnt be drinking a Märzen past September, let me mention that Ive savored this beer on many occasions in the past. Ive simply never felt the need to analyze nor defend it... much in the same way I dont need to justify who I keep as my friends. To whomever questions my sensibilities, Ill simply ask them politely to go to hell. Regardless (and for the sake of civility) Ill drop a reviewers word or two: Deep amber bodied, yes, yes... with a long lasting head, yes.... but Ive poured todays beer in a huge ceramic stein in which it feels simply perfect. Thick in the mouth with ramped up hops, malts and alcohol. Balanced? Piffle. Whats the phrase? ""When you have fat friends there are no see-saws, only catapults?"" Thats the sense of balance you get from this fat friend. Along with the Maharaja and the Czar, The Kaiser is not a dictator to be trifled with.Yet together we relax and laugh at the growing storm outside... and Ill be calling on this old friend in the future, probably in the most remarkable of situations.

1246,"2006-10-20",3.0,"Theres something absurd about an Imperial Oktoberfest, and by that label alone my anticipation of Averys craft was of a rather mediocre grade. The crepuscular copper hue transpared perfectly, displaying in full light the ugly claims of filtration, and foaming above in an ephemeral white mousse. Volatile vapors of alcohol appear sharpened upon the nose, followed by fruity tones of pear, lemon, melon and rosé wine. The sweetness of acacia honey soaks the prominent alcohol in a cloying and unpleasant combination. Malts become far more conspicuous in the flavor, blending burnt coffee, bitter caramel and honey to a an equally hot mouthfeel and strong carbonation. Despite the intense aggression this beer invokes on the palate, I found the complexity lacking, yielding nothing more than a bland and painful experience.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, deep amber color, with a thick and creamy head, and a good carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent, with lots of good toasty, and nutty malt aromas. The palate is firm, with a slick mouthfeel, on a very smooth body. Lots of good toasty and nutty malt coat the tongue, with hints of malted milk ball sweetness. This beer finishes with more good toasty and nutty malt up front, then ends with some really good grassy/herbal hop bitterness to balance out the malty character of this beer.

Palate is medium bodied and lively with a creamy texture, but lacking the crisp lager palate usually noted in OFests.  Finish is still sweet with only a slight hop bitterness emerging.

1246,"2006-09-28",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 The people of Germany, their kin and their adoring fans have much to be proud of in Germanys cultural heritage.  It bore the birthing pains of Protestantism, is marked by an acute proficiency in engineering and philosophy and is responsible for the manufacture and export of some of the finest seasoned and cured sausages.  And anybody who treats meat and its consumers with that kind of respect is okay in my book.  But lets face it; the Kaiser was a fool.  I distinctly remember my A.P. European History teacher praising the practical and often cruel genius of Otto von Bismarck, then relegating Kaiser Wilhelm II as the Shtoopid shtoopid boy that messed up Bismarcks calculated plans.  It seems unflattering for Avery to christen one of those beers as one of Europes most celebrated regal dunces, but the name is fitting.  Averys Kaiser is altogether inadequate; it fails to live up to a loftier legacy of brewmanship with the same flare of ineptness that marked Wilhelms catastrophic statesmanship.  It is a typical pumpkin colored beer with a defiantly large head that compresses, developing a center of bigger bubbles and a periphery of smaller ones.  Beneath the optical delectation is a deceptively full aroma  pumpkin, brown sugar, vanilla, hops, malt, orange and coriander twist and turn amongst themselves to develop a candied sweet sniff.  And there, even further is the truly fulsome taste.  Its a plain and humble flavor, but proud of its humility; the worst kind of humble.  It seems flat and tamed, like an ESB with a delicate touch of pumpkin, pumpkin pies brown sugary sweetness and an enveloping smooth texture.  These qualities, though pleasant, deny the Kaiser any level of complexity itd need to be a defining beer experience.  That aside, its a reasonable well brewed beer for casual company on a casual day, in the same way that Germany would have been better off having their Kaiser a casual man working in a casual profession in a casual town as far away from Berlin as Bismarck could have booted him.  We cant loathe either the beer or the man, but we know theres better, and thats my take on Avery as much as its a historical judgment of the perils of monarchy in 19th century Europe.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

At first swallow, doesnt really blow my socks off; tastes like a regular Ofest, albeit sweeter than most. At second swallow, the considerable acohol is more evident. At 3rd sip, the hops chime in, and at that point you know this is no ordinary ofest. This is a very strong brew, despite their ""toning it down"" from last years version. I dont think it needed to be this strong to be good. Granted, its an imperial Ofest, so its supposed to be strong. This style is a little bit of an oxymoron. Oktoberfest is about drinking mass quantities of beer; if you had one mass of this stuff, youd be in a word of hurt. Therefore, its less an ofest than an imperial IPA is an IPA. About midway through my first glass I am still looking for the wow factor and its not coming. It tastes like they just threw alcohol at it. I still like it better than 90+% of the ofests Ive had (or perhaps 97.5% according to the style percentile).

Yes, the ethanol is strong and mean, but what you should really love about this beer is the complete palate. Beers just dont get much thicker.

Aroma is a light, sweet malt backed with lemongrass, fresh jalapeno and some barbeque. Flavor is intense. Extremely creamy and lucious fruity malt, loaded with figs and pears and light apple. Flavor moves across the tounge with elegance and sheer volume. Alcohol really rounds this Octoberfest, as lesser ones usually lack some fullness from lesser strength. An almost perfumy fruit quality to it, like mulled wine. Crisp clean malt on the back end, mingled with grassy hops. Most interesting is that the palate is what shines strongest for this beer, with the liquid cream, warm alcohol, yet balanced with a bright soda level and finishing with a smack of hop dryness.

The aroma is mostly malt in the caramels that youd expect from an ofest. There is a bit more hops than youd expect and this bit of alcohol that you definitely wouldnt expect under that maltiness, however. The flavor has a good wood and caramel maltiness. Very clean. Theres a bit more bitterness than usual, but then, theres also a bit more sweetness than usual, so they end up balancing each other out. The slight warmth of the alcohol helps cleanse the palate after each sip. Really much better than I expected.

1246,"2005-10-21",3.9,"2005 edition.  Clear, opulent and magnifying copper-orange in color with a few dusty concentrations for the head.  Aroma entices with peppered grain, caramel, rye, flame licked hazelnuts, cedar, vanilla, black licorice and a touch of canned sweet corn.  Imperial Oktoberfest indeed.  Flavor grabs that caramel and toasty signature qualities and amplifies the shit out of it.  Strong caramel and almond extract impart a quality as if theyve been lacquered onto a porous wooden park bench.  Spiciness is dialed up a notch as well, most prominently prickling with peppered and floral phenols.  Stinging sensations all the way home.  Full-bodied, given the style, with a syrupy viscosity.  Substitute the word ""balance"" for ""malts, malts, malts"" and we have an accurate recording on the congruency, which, in turn is paired with respectable noble hopping.  Boozy, with the tongue sonorously pressing against the roof of the mouth time and time again to gain a more accurate comprehension of what this mother lager truly is.  Toned toffee and butterscotch with rye comprise the finish, moving into peppered bread aftertaste.  Well done, Avery.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Mouthfeel has a yeasty creaminess, even from the bomber.  Mostly malt taste with some caramel, dough, dried fruit perhaps plum in there.  Some of the flavor is lost when the alcohol burns off your taste buds.  Hops evident in the bitter finish, but still predominantly malt.  I guess if you want to be a stickler to the style, I think an Ayinger still wins, but this is more what I would prefer as an oktoberfest.

The body is a beautiful hue of amber and chestnut; and the head is resilient, tall and khaki. The aroma and flavor beautifully convey luscious submissions of toffee, molasses, and mouth watering caramel apples rolled in diced peanuts. You know the candy Sugar Daddies, well somehow Avery fit a couple sticks of those into this bottle as well! Also, wonderful suggestions of brown sugar, date sugars, plums and brandy soaked cherries. A year later and the hops are still holding strong; spicy, woodsy and rather citric with suggestions of orange peel in the finish.

After drinking bigger and more complex beers I began to find the Oktoberfests to be thin and one maybe two dimensional. The Kaiser has redeemed the style for me in artfully intensifying without blowing out of proportion all the malty, sweet, spicy aspects of this seasonal brew. To acheive this complexity without becoming something altogether different is masterful.

Aroma speaks initially of caramel and nuts, then spices and dark fruits, malt is on top with a whisper of hops. Finishes its display still full of character, before mellowing out.
Taste: Massive presence in the mouth, chewy and gooey maltiness, a well-rounded sweetness. Almost ponderously thick on the palate. Primary actors from the nose step onto the tongue and please the senses there. The fruitiness, the herbal/ nutty thing, but mostly the caramel malt. Full bodied, with a long, spicy, dry finish. Loving it!
This is a fresh 2005 edition, and the abv listed is 8.9%. The alcohol comes to the fore after 1/3 through the bottle, and begins a slight burn, but the taste is terrific, so it only adds to the excitement.

1246,"2005-09-09",4.0,"Imperial Oktoberfest sounds like an oxymoron at first, since how can a style known for high drinkability be melded with the group of styles that are known for massive assaults on all senses?  To find out I had to pop the cap off of this Avery seasonal arriving newly in Georgia.

After the 22 oz. bomber was uncapped, and the beer poured into a mug, the look was similar to a standard Oktoberfestbier, but just a shade or two darker.  The head was two finger tall, and lacy, and the most impressive part of the look was the sloooowly rising tiny bubbles through the thick and viscous body.  The aroma was quite unlike the real biers of the season, with a really massive bouquet of hops greeting me at the first whiff.  There were also the Avery signature alcohol fumes.  With those two smells assaulting my nostrils, this brew did not do much to distinguish itself from the other big offerings from the Boulder brewery.

The taste was also hop dominated, however the malts did put up quite a Kampf here.  The richness and intensity of the alternating malt and hops flavors reminded me a lot of a barleywine.  The hops were peppery, pungent, and citric, while the malt was juicy berry, red delicious apple, and brown sugar flavored.  The mouthfeel was thick and hairy like a German barmaid raised on a steady diet of Bratwurst.  A definite sipper, this one was nothing like a Märzen made for gulping.

 What the great wide-open hell is an ""imperial Oktoberfest"" anyway? Has the word ""imperial"" simply become synonymous with ""high gravity version of"" whatever style follows the word on the label? If so, I suppose this beer is close to the mark. It is a complex dark, rich, sweet malty lager. Where it misses the mark, as Avery does with many of its products, is with its unpleasantly astringent  hop flavor that is exceptionally aggressive for the style. Oktoberfests, of course,  typically have a low to moderate hop profile, letting the complex malts do the heavy lifting. This beer is WAY too hop-forward for the style. This is a decent beer, but not an Oktoberfest -- imperial or othrewise.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

I really enjoy Avery and wouldnt wish for them to curtail experimentation at all, but for some brewers this means hit or miss. This wasnt a big miss for me, but a bit of a mess. Malty and just over the top in a way I didnt appreciate.

1246,"2005-07-10",3.0,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2005 (22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with goldtwins, thanks Larry!) I know that many breweries are trying to ""Imperialize"" their beers, and I’m definitely on board with this trend, but I just think an Oktoberfest is a somewhat subtle style that shouldn’t be a victim of this ""supersize me"" mentality.  Adding more malt makes it too sweet and too heavy, and additional hops makes it far too bitter to be an Oktoberfest.  Just make a good Oktoberfest, is that too much to ask?  Anyway, this is a very flavorful brew, but it just tastes too sweet and caramely, too bitter, too alcoholic to even be classified as an Oktoberfest.  Honestly, the bitterness is just too much period, and rather than tasting hoppy, it’s rather astringent and harsh from start to finish, but especially in the finish.  Alcohol is overdone, burning, way too hot, bordering on toxic, but this has been aged for several months, so what’s the deal?  In the end, it just doesn’t taste very good.  The palate is pretty heavy, somewhat sticky and cloying, despite the bitter finish.  The nose is lightly caramely, but actually very much dominated by a pleasant, sweet fruitiness.  Surprisingly, alcohol seems pretty minimal in the nose.  Deep, ruddy amber in color.  Light tan head rises to a respectable size, nearly an inch, and shows decent retention, never fading less than a full, thin layer.  Lacing is modest, leaving a few uneven rings with sporadic patches.  While it smells and looks appealing, I hate to say it, but this is not all that pleasant a beer to drink.  Just too harsh in flavor and on the palate.  Gotta know when to say when, and in my opinion, Avery has far exceeded the bounds of this style.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
1246,"2005-07-08",3.5,"Gorgeous reddish orange body with smallish white head.  Mild, fruity/spicy aroma, that reminds me of a barleywine.  In fact, the beer reminds me of a weak, watered down barleywine.  Heavy on the spices and malts.  Caramel and dates, figs and some hearty hops.  This beer is interesting, but it is not quite delicate enough for an oktoberfest brew.  Astringent and alcoholic finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"

Appearance is a deep amber body with a tall off white head. Nice rings of lace were left decorating the glass as I drank this. The aroma of sweet malt and a bready smell masked the alcohol almost completely here. Still not a very complex smell. Malt sweetness dominates the palette along with a warming alcohol presence. A bit of a spicy sweet after taste lingers around for a bit. Mouthfeel is medium and almost full, definitely the thickest of the style I have had.

Taste is watery and could benefit from some carbonation. Taste is thick and syrupy, like an oddly hopped barleywine.  Biting hop flavors, pine and metallic, on top of honey, leather and banana esters. Aftertaste is pencil shavings, metal and burnt sugars. Alcohol level is medium for a big beer. Overall, a beer with fresh ingredients but that is really not that great. Just because it has a flashy name and bottle doesnt make this a great beer. It needs better flavor continuity and a removal of the harsh flavors.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"

Hell, its not that far off from Smuttonator.  Which immediately makes you think hops.  Yes, the hops are here in force.

1246,"2004-12-05",4.0,"i think calling this an oktoberfest is a stretch, but i guess its the closest style there is--its too extreme, too hoppy for the style but its still really good.  tons of dark malt, but it feels like theres an abundance of cascade hops that gives the palate a slight tang.  very good beer.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
1246,"2004-12-01",3.1,"Okay.  This beer brings up the style v.  sheer goodness debate.  This is absolutely not an oktoberfest.  It tastes like Averys IIPA, just with slightly different malts.

The body is full and rather robust, especially for the style.  The flavor is nice, starting sweet, becoming warm at the top and finishing with an earthy, spicy bitterness.  Not really my favorite beer, but Im glad I got to try it.  I prefer my Oktoberfest beers to be less intense.  They should be well balanced and highly drinkable.  This is good but will not be a regular at my table.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

1246,"2004-11-28",4.3,"I know they get a lot of criticism as being a marketing gimmick, but I tend to love ""Imperial"" versions of beers.  Imperial Pilsner?  Sure!  Double Helles?  Why not?  So when I saw Avery with an Impy Okto, I was excited.  And apprehensive.  After all, just because it is imperial doesnt mean its good.  This, however, did not disappoint.  Clear copper, touch of ruby and orange, slender head that fades completely.  Aroma is fantastic, some caramel malts mixed in with a lovely nose of floral hops.  The flavor changes over time.  Initially when cool, the malt start is caramel accented, with a floral hop finish.  As it warmed towards room temperature, roasted coffee notes began to emerge from the malts, while a well integrated earthy hop flavor showed on the finish.  Full bodied, luscious, and throroughly enjoyable.  This was a fun, interesting beer, one of the best Ive had in quite some time.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

I like this vintage better than the 2004.  A very nice ""imperial"" style brew.

2004 bottle sampled 11/24/04: Pours a rich copper brown with a thin off-white head.  Aroma is full of sweet German caramel malt and a touch of hoppiness.  Body starts a sweet and viscous blend of caramel and toasted malts.  Finishes more dry and hoppy with more of a bitter US hop presence.  The malt billing here seems to be right on par with what I would consider an imperial oktoberfest, but the hops exert more bitterness than Id prefer.

Pleasant appearance (clear copper-orange body, thin/medium cream head) and a very interesting aroma- fruit (akin to strawberry syrup, as badnewsbeers suggested), honey, soy and strong alcohol notes.  The flavor was a bit of a let-down, however.  The best Oktoberfests have layered breads and caramels that engage all parts of the tongue, but the toast and hints of caramel The Kaiser offers were quickly subdued and overwhelmed by the surprisingly noticeable ethanol flavors.  The quick alcohol ""hit"" prevented the beer from developing any complexity.

Firm, somewhat dense palate which ends in an acidic, malty finish.  Very well hidden alcohol, but not really complex.  The balance seems slightly off.  I agree with Mike et al about aging this, but I honestly dont know if I can let it sit that long without craving it.  It didnt knock my socks off like I expected, but this is still an excellent, assertive lager.  Cheers to Avery in the innovation department.  As long as they crank out beers like this, Ill keep buying them.  Even considering my listed flaws (which are minor) I still deem this 4.0-worthy.

Quite enjoyable and SO MUCH BETTER than the other Marzen brews I have had this season. Rerate: A year old bottle that has been aging gracefully in my ""cellar"". The bitters have mellowed out and the spice flavor seem to meld in a smoother finish. I enjoyed this much more than the 1st time and have change my Flavor and Overall score point each.  Original rating: Bottle: Ruby brown hue with small fizzy but mostly lasting head and good lace. The aroma has notes of caramel, toast, orange zest, aromatic and floral hops, earthy yeast esters, peppery spice, and noticeable phenols. The taste starts with a twangy fruit and sweet malt combination followed by a heavy dose of spice, bitters, and alcohol. Some citric and yeast background for some balance. The feel is aggressive, lively, biting, and a bit metallic. Overall, it is enjoyable but still too young. The hops need to meld into the flavor and the bite hopefully mellowed.

1246,"2004-10-09",3.1,"Pours a brilliantly clear, ruby-amber-copper color.  It is topped by a frothy white head that is generated by a medium level of carbonation.  The aroma is sweetly malty with notes of caramel, biscuits.  It also has a low level of hop aromatics that contribute a slightly fruity note intermingled with a spicy-herbal-grassy note.  This beer is quite thick bodied and sweet, but the thing that I really notice during my first sip is how hoppy this is.  It is quite a bit more balanced towards the hops than even a doubling of a traditional Oktoberfest recipe would suggest.  Leave it to the American brewers to hop up a traditionally malty beer, though as a pioneer of the Imperial Oktoberfest, I guess they can do what ever they want.

Given all of this, this beer would actually not be as interesting or balanced if not for the over-the-top hops.  The beer is quite sweet, and would likely be sticky if not for the hop punch.  The beer has a pungent, spicy, bergamot, herbal hop flavor to it, which floats on a malty backbone that is redolent of caramel, and biscuit notes.  The finish is a bit astringent, with a mixture of hop bitterness and alcohol.  This thing could definitely use some mellowing.  If it were not for the finish this would be at its best now.  I think a couple of months of age, could really help to mellow this beer out.

The new glow / appeal of this beer has definitely faded for me, now that I have finished half a glass.  The beer just seems a bit too harsh and unbalanced.  I definitely recommend aging this for quite a while, I have two more bottles which I will perhaps try again in the spring.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Balanced carbonation and texture gave it a good mouthfeel.  The flavor was more what I consider a good Oktoberfest/Marzen to be like.  Avery has done it again.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
1246,"2004-09-20",3.5,"A rubbery, plasticy, alcohol laden aroma with some woody spiciness greets you - German, yes, but also piney elements. The body is slippery, lagerlike, but still, thinner than that (the alcohol?). Caramelly, big time - burnt plastic with a barky pine - this is like an Imperial Alt, maybe, with a few Centennials thrown in the kettle. Hard to judge, frankly, given the 9% plus, and a pretty fatiguing sweetness at the end. Even though I like it, and I like experimentation, I suppose I like my lagers pretty trad - for example, its hard to get the Hallertau here.

The taste is what you might expect, an amped up Octoberfest. The sweet malt and brown sugar are followed by hops, and a bit of bitterness at the end. The body is on the heavy side, but not too much to make it unpleasant. All in all, very intesesting.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"

Damp wool and honeydew suggestions. Fuzzy, slightly velvety carbonation. Manageable thickness. Opens with bold earthy malt layers with a sweet alcohol tailing. Alcohol gradually intensifies, climaxing at the center and amplifying the commanding hop bitterness with hints of medicine and raw cane sugar. Earthy roast fails to mesh with the hops, but theres plenty of redeeming bright mineral qualities and clean airiness underneath, which offsets the figgy malts. Medicinal flavor resurfaces late, erasing much of the remaining hoppiness. Slight roast astringency in the finish, with a clean, underlying lagery mineral note, fresh, but subdued, hops, and vaporous blasts of alcohol. Bready, leathery malts and minerals linger. Surprisingly complex, yet subtle enough to retain its drinkability throughout the glass. This is much more than the novelty I was expecting, and for their first venture into the land of lager, my hat's off.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Thicker lightly silky feel. On the edge of being too heavy, but I like it. My second bottle thanks to a beer exchange artist, which will be keep quiet, and after the first, I thought to myself this is a Marzen Malt Liquor. It has the rich malt of a marzen, but then has the alcohol and mild bite as it warms of a malt liquor. A bit to much for what is to be an easy quaff. But its all about extremes now, right. Imperial this, barrel aged that.  Im dangerously close to a rant. But then again that is what is great about this country (USA), we what what we want, when we want it, and lots of it.

If you enjoy complex malty beers then this is must try. Hides the alcohol very well, extreamly smooth for  such a young beer and will only get better which is very frightening. Next to the 2001 vintage of Reverend which Avery served up at their 11th Aniversery party last month this is the best beer Ive had from Colorado (been to 20 of the brew pubs here). Cant wait for that Fall chill to roll in to try another.

1246,"2004-08-30",4.0,"Lets start this off by saying this: This beer is NOT a fall seasonal.
It is a ""One of"". Meaning its only going to brewed once, and thats it. Check their website if you dont believe me. That being said, lets review it. 22 oz. brown bomber bottle, with a silver foil overwrap on the crown. Very colorful label, Iron Cross and all.
Bottled in 2004 date on front label. Poured out a deep copper / reddish amber color, with a huge off-white head that wouldnt go away. It looked like someone spooned whipped cream on top of my beer. Very sticky head, it left a thick, sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The beer itself is very clear. Aromas are of fresh Munich malts, maybe some Vienna in the mix as well. Earthy Noble hops in the aromas, my guess is Hallertauer or Hersbrucker.
Maybe a pinch of Perle for the bittering. Anyway, theyre spicy, earthy, and slightly fruity. (You cant fool this old kraut.)
Regal tastes of fresh water, fresh malts, and fresh hops. Slight caramel, along with spicy notes mix with the fruity hops to make a wonderful experience for the beer connoisseur. This beer is not to be missed. Smooth mouthfeel comes from the lagering process. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, but makes its presence known as its swallowed. Warming to a fault, this beer would be excellent on a chilly, windy November evening, when the leaves are blowing around, and the Earth is settling in for a Winter slumber. It would warm you to the bones, and take your breath away. Too bad its a ""One of"", because this would make an excellent seasonal. I know Id buy it again. The finish is smooth, well balanced, and slightly earthy and fruity at the same time. I highly recommend this beer, if you can find it before its all gone. Good luck to you.","","Cobra"

The Kaiser isnt just another tie or some lousy socks, either. Its yet another shining star in the Avery Milky Way. The beer pours clear and has an amber-red glow with a light tan head. Chewy, inviting nose. Un-fricken-believable mouthfeel -- extremely creamy and fluffy, as if youre swallowing a cloud. Malts had notes of dark toast, toffee, and a little chocolate. Malt-lovers shouldnt be disappointed. Hops were very balancing and complemented the malts well. Bitterness level was fitting and not over-the-top at all. Gentle notes of oranges and flowers. Kind of spicy and peppery, too. Alcohol wasnt really noticeable when drinking it, but it sure left behind a cozy warmth in the ol esophagus. Great stuff!

Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, caramel), moderately hoppy (apricot, orange, flowers), with a note of peach. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.  A marked improvement over the 2004, the 2005 relies more on the malt in its nose and doesnt clobber with sharp piney hops. Still cant say its German in character (sorry guys...its very nice, but Id never guess from the aroma that it came from a German brewery, nor that its German styled).  Where the 2004 most resembled an American Strong Ale (based on its strength and hop character), its now more like an English Strong Ale...apricotty/orangey (British-smelling) hops, thick/juicy/sticky malt that reminds me of Maris Otter, what can I say?  But Im not complaining, just describing.  Its a big strong malty beer, lager or not, and as such its very luxurious and delightful.  Thumbs up overall.  Nice improvement, guys!

2004 bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting. Body is clear dark amber. Aroma is moderately hoppy (resin/pine, apricot, flowers), moderately malty (cookie). Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, creamy/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. The aroma is surprisingly docile for as big a beer as it is, and sadly not very German in nature (despite the use of German malt & yeast, Hallertauer Trad & Tettnanger hops)...it has that familiar pine sap/resin ""green hop"" twang that grates on me. Belches confirm its quite American in nature where the hops are concerned. And the malt character isnt nearly as toasty as the better Oktoberfests Ive had...its kind of ordinary in that aspect. And despite knowing this is a lager, I would still put it in the American Strong Ale category...it smells like one and tastes like one, and frankly cant think of a better style on this site for it. But my main disappointment is only in the aroma; it looks nice, has good balance (very drinkable at 9.3%, and although leaning to the sweet side just a tad too much, its not fatiguing), and a luscious mouthfeel. Overall, this misses the target IMHO, and doesnt really resemble a German Oktoberfest (even a strong one). But as an ASA, it works just fine. [score = 3.5]","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
