2280,"2017-01-20",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed at a bottle share at Seans on December 29. 750 mL bottle. First, I would like to share HonusWagners sentiment with who the hell does a collaboration with themselves. Thats hilarious. The pour is a dark garnet or ruby tinted brown color with a thin ting of beige head that fades quickly, leaving nothing behind. The aroma is great. There is a heavy raspberry and cherry right up front with a lovely jamminess and a subtle tart black currant poking through on the finish. There is a sweetness to the malts and a light barrel addition that I love. The flavoe is much of the same. This is like the beer equivalent of Heart of Darkness. The fruitiness is excellent and deep. The light tartness balances the barrel and makes this just so deep and lovely. The mouth feel is a little thicker and more softly carbonated than youd like to see. There is a great fruitiness and a hint of barrel with absolutely no alcohol on the back end. This is phenomenal.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

2280,"2016-08-27",3.9,"Bottle thanks to John. Pours a clear dark brown color with a small beige head. A big pinot fruity nose. The flavor is big grape juice, sugary purple drink, berries. No heat. Awesome. Insane.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2280,"2016-08-27",4.2,"Bottle shared by ""vyvvy"" at the abode of ""hannont"". Colour...dark garnet brown with no head. Nose...big, sweet fruit with cherry, plum, Concord grapes and currants. Palate... sweet, tart, and loaded with grapey fruits and boiled sweets. The mid palate is slightly tannic and very tart. The finish is very long and fruity with grape skins, plum compote and cherry filled doughnuts.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
2280,"2016-08-24",4.6,"Basic motherfuckers will probably be intimidated by this ticks complexity but its fruity and sweet enough that their palates will probably be satiated. Also who the fuck collaborates with themselves.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2280,"2016-06-03",4.0,"Bottle. Dark pour with some head. Toffee, sweet, tart cherries, raspberries and fruit aromas. Sweet toffee, candy and tart fruits, cherries, raspberries and cranberry sour tones.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"

2280,"2016-04-02",3.4,"Huna Day. Dark brown pour. Nose is sour dark fruits, vinous, very pruney. Taste is prunes, booze, a touch of cheap port wine. Sticky rich mouthfeel. Too much prunes in the taste for me.","","knickskicks"
2280,"2016-03-20",4.0,"Served at Hunahpu day, though I didnt see if it was tap or bottles. Deep reddish amber. Smell is sweet. Vanilla with currants, raspberries, dark fruits, and red wine. Taste is similar. Lots of currants and fruits. Sweet and sour in equal portions. Red wine and bourbon both come through. Heavy. I had no concept of what this beer was before drinking it. Just got to try it. Very nice.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
2280,"2016-02-03",4.3,"Danish pour at the 2015 RateBeer Best festival, which much thanks to the SP guys for letting me try it! Pours hazy mahogany with some suspended particles and a small tan head with some lacing. Aroma is roasty, raspberries, blackberry, chocolate, bourbon. Flavor is medium plus tart, lightly funky, super fruity with less roastiness than the color would imply. Medium body, creamy soft mouthfeel. Quite nice.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2280,"2016-02-01",4.4,"This was an excellent take on a quad. Super complex and rich and for its ABV it was dangerously smooth. Balanced fruit forwardness with touches of bourbon. Had at Ratebeer fest.","California, USA","Soured_Hops"
2280,"2016-01-08",4.3,"The beer pours very dark brown with a minimal head. The aroma has a lot of rich malt, a fruit cocktail juiciness with lots of raspberry and cherry along with dark quad malt/yeast. Out has a thick smooth rich body with about no carbonation. The taste is pretty sweet, but comes off a natural fruit juice. It has fruit of the aroma with good amt of tart notes and some caramel. The finish is slick and rich. Excellent.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
