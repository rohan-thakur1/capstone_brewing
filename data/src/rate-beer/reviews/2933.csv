Canned pears, a mellow sweetness from yellow apples. What stands most out is the woodies. Really nice aroma. Tastes quite good also this. Its really low in the carbonation, near flat and it has a gliding oily texture in the mouth. Mild tartish and wood dry, yet shining with apple, apple juices and a little vanilla?

2933,"2014-05-29",3.9,"Bottle.
Appearance: Crystal clear straw-golden hue with a transparent ring on top.
Aroma: Hints of oak, bourbon and vanilla along with a hints of spiced sweesemi-sweet apple cider. This smells very nice, it could use some strength but everything is balanced nicely.
Taste: The apples and bourbon fight for attention, slightly tart, hinting towards sour even. Its decent as heck, but Im not in love. I would like a little more sweetness. The finish is of apple skins and cinnamon.
Palate: Medium bodied, highly carbonated.
Overall: I enjoy this, but I enjoy the aroma more than the taste. The aroma reminds me of hot slightly spiced apple cider with a shot of bourbon in it. The taste is too skewed towards tart and dry for me to love it. Its good though, I just dont know if its $20 good.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

2933,"2014-01-23",3.8,"Sample at Hopleaf. Pours a clear yellow-gold color with a thin fizzy white head that burns away quickly to an outer ring. Short strings of lacing on the glass. Fruit, spices and vanilla in the nose. Medium-bodied with flavors of tart spiced apples, vanilla and oak. The finish is mildly sour apples with an oaky vanilla aftertaste. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2933,"2014-01-23",3.5,"Poured from a 750mL I received as part of the 2013 RateBeer Secret Santa (thanks!). There is no freshness date indicated. It pours a clear golden color with no head. The nose is tart with no trace of the bourbon barrel aging. To be honest, I had no idea what to expect with a bourbon-aged cider; Ive never had one before. The palate is over-ripe apples with the bourbon aging asserting itself in the form of a distinct smoked oak note from the barrels themselves. No trace of the bourbon booziness, though. Its nice and tart, but it isnt as crisp as many of the other ciders Ive tried.","Albany, New York, USA","justabeergeek"
2933,"2014-01-12",3.7,"pours light yellow slight haze, small white head. Aroma is faint apple and vanilla. Taste is moderately sweet with also a bit of tart, mostly apple, hint of oak and very subtle bourbon, finishes sweet. Good stuff, too pricey.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","mcmd"
2933,"2013-11-30",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2014 Bottle: thanks, Scott! Nice, sweet, cider-y aroma with notes of apple, light cinnamon sticks, mild boozy oak, some potpourri-like spice, & a big sugary aspect in the back-end. Smooth taste with mild bourbon notes. Apple, spice, cinnamon, clove, sharp oak. Heavily carbonated with a nice snap. Would be hard to drink a bunch, but it was quite tasty.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
2933,"2013-09-26",3.9,"Draft. Poured clear amber color with a minimal white head that diminished slowly with minimal legs. Moderate to heavy aroma of tart apple, vanilla wood and bourbon. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy apple, vanilla and bourbon flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. My expectations were exceeded with a standout cider.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2933,"2013-08-30",3.5,"Draft to taster. Looks alright; no real carbonation though. A transparent gold with razor-thin white lacing. Smells solid; apple cider and bourbon. Tastes like it smells with a solid mouthfeel. A good cider.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

2933,"2013-05-12",3.7,"May 11, 2013 - tap at GI 25th anniversary party.  Clear yellow with limited head.  Aroma and taste were bourbon, caramel and apple.  Taste also had some wood.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
2933,"2013-03-27",3.2,"On tap at Local Option. Pour is orange/yellow. Aroma is of fresh pressed apples, some sweet honey, and alcohol. Flavor is fairly mellow for a cider, the sweetness from the apples and honey overpower the barrel aging. I wish the notes from the barrel aging were more pronounced, but its not bad.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
2933,"2013-03-16",3.0,"On tap at Lincoln Hall Chicago. Light slightly dry and slightly sweet. A decent English style cider but a little on the watered down side of interesting.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
2933,"2013-02-24",3.7,"Sampled at the 2013 Chicago Cider Summit. Pours a dehydrated pee like color with no head whatsoever. Aroma is a bit boozy with some sweet apples and a bit of earthiness. Flavor is more balanced with sweet apple that is slightly dry and has a nice bit of booze in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2933,"2013-02-09",3.5,"Draft pour on tap at Cider Summit 2013 (Navy Pier, Chicago, IL). Been pretty excited for this one. Pours a richly pale champagne hue, touches of yellow, straw and yellow glow. A gentle haziness, frothy whitish head dies to a ring, laces small. Aromas are gentle oak, apples, and kisses of honey. Vanilla tannins, gentle oaky spirit, and mellow honey, straw hit the nose. A mellow bite of barrel grows as it warms. Initial is medium bodied, a bit lighter with rich barrel, tannic vanilla and gentle spirit coat the palate. A touch of warmth, honeycrisp apples and gentle sweetness, fruit. Gentle bourbon, spirit and vanilla. Dries out a touch, lingering barrel into the backend. Overall, it still has some juicy red apple appeal, mellow yet firm sweetness. Oak is prevalent, gentle subtle carbonation. It has character but is probably my least favorite Virtue to date. Solid.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
