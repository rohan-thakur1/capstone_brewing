Strong scent of chocolate, with coffee coming through behind ahead of a hint of toast. Chocolate comes first again when tasting, and a toasty, nutty flavor lingers.

168,"2013-09-14",4.4,"An absolutely outstanding ale that has sat tucked away on the shelves at my favourite beer store, unnoticed by me until now. Cellar temperature and into a snifter. The cap came off with a breath of silence and at first I suspected a flat beer. Pours with not much vigour yet lifts a good inch of tannish cream atop its inky black body. Deliciously thick, sweet and savoury malt and yeast nose reminiscent of Belgian choc fondant, rum balls, liquorice root, humbug candies, Kecap Manis soy sauce, leather and treacle. A light spritz accentuates the front of the palate where some very bitter malt flavours seem to dwell. Chalky and dusty smooth from there on in; not overly heavy in the body department. The soy sauce of the aroma  umami perhaps! - melds well with darkest chocolate (85% cocoa), liquorice and treacly notes all subdued by a lot of earthiness late. Long bitter chocolate, rum-barrel, charred wood and liquorice finish. Alcohol is heated but balances well.  A very harmonious beer that has all the hallmarks of an aged porter. An hour after finishing I could still taste this on my lips. One of those ""dont judge the book by its cover"" beers. A lovely and complex winter warmer!

Smell: Much like your typical porter or stout. Heavy on the coffee. Alcohol can be tasted a bit. Chocolates may be in there as well.

Taste/feel: What can I say. Its just a quality beer. I think of it as more of a stout, but thats just me. It has all the qualifications. The thing I can say about this beer is that it seems to be more bitter than most stouts Ive had, so that makes it a little different. The highlight of this beer is certainly the feel. It seems sort of ""meh"", but if you let it sit in your mouth for a second before you swallow, it gets really nice and creamy, and you get that warmth when you finally swallow.

Overall, a quality beer. As I said a couple times, drinks like a stout. Its a pretty big, deep, rich, coffee flavored beer.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

168,"2013-02-26",3.7,"12 ounce bottle in an American shaker. Aroma is toasted bread, malts, and smoke. Appearance is pitch black, completely opaque, a headlight wouldnt shine through the stuff, and it carries a tan foam on top.  The taste is an old diner blend of cigarette smoke, bitter coffee grinds, and mild acidity. This beer would probably taste amazing with scrambled eggs. Palate is heavy bodied and nicely balance with carbonation. Overall its not my thing because its too bitter and smoky (I prefer my non-imperial porters more subdued) but I can see why the big bold flavors and sturdy texture make it well received by others.

168,"2012-12-16",3.8,"12 oz bottle, Whole Foods Columbus.  ""Black Ale,"" not ""Black Bier.""  This one was unexpected.

Aroma roast, chocolate, lightly coffee.  Flavor similarly roasty, coffee, chocolate.  Medium-thick, frothy in the mouth, lightly sticky.

168,"2011-09-06",4.5,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.

Appearance: Pure black with thin brown head and light lacing lines.

Aroma: Roasted aroma, but quite sweet - molasses, cookies & cream, chocolate, vanilla, licorice and something reminiscent of a Christmas tree.

Taste: Strong roasted flavor but fairly creamy and sweet. Chocolate, light coffee, cream, licorice, molasses and pine. Ends somewhat bitter, but a nice touch of creamy sweetness remains throughout. Tastes like a blend of a Stout, a Cafe Mocha and, more some reason, Anchor Christmas Ale.

Palate: Relatively low carbonation. Body is creamy, silky and smooth, but surprisingly not quite full-bodied.

Overall: Very nice - both very complex and easy to drink. BA and Dark Horse both claim this is not a Stout, but surely it is a Stout of some kind. It seems like a ramped-up, bitter and higher alcohol Cream Stout, with a strange dash of holiday spirit.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

color nocciola marcato,  abbondante, fine e media persistenza, anche se un 3 mm di schiuma resistono fino alla fine, rimanendo sul fondo del bicchiere
COLORE:
nero, con leggeri riflessi marroni-rossastri controluce
INTENSITA / FINEZZA / AROMA
profumata, con il tostato in prima linea, che si veste di note di caffè, cioccolato amaro, liquirizia e un sentore di affumicato (ricorda lodore della brace spenta). Una punta di alcohol, mentre i luppoli rimangono mascherati dal forte torrefatto.
GUSTO / RETROGUSTO / PERSISTENZA
da subito la bocca si riempe di sapori tostati, quasi bruciacchiati, ricordando pane bruciato o fondo di caffè. Subentra una leggera acidità che ricorda il cioccolato fondente. Come base un leggero ( ma molto leggero) dolce, che scompare al deglutire, in favore di un amaro torrefatto che si stabilizza a metà della gola. lamaro del luppolo è sfuggente, quasi nullo rispetto alle note precedenti: nessun luppolo americano allorizzonte.

CORPO / CARBONATAZIONE / CONSISTENZA
corpo medio, carbonata il giusto, in bocca da una sensazione oleosa, consistente senza però arrivare ai livelli tipici di imperial stout o baltic porter.
buona, intensa ed interessante. Mio primo prodotto della Dark Horse, sicuramente non lultimo. Si parla di black ale piuttosto che di porter; sinceramente non colgo la sfumatura, assomiglia molto ad altre porter Usa provate e la unica differenza che possono trovare è un torrefatto più accentuato e una mancanza quasi assoluta dei luppoli. Forse questo aspetto la rende un pelino monocorde, e ripetere immediatamente è un compito arduo. qualcuno ha azzardato un parallelismo con una schwartzbier ""robusta"",.. interessante.","(Madrid","molly75"

168,"2011-01-06",3.7,"Bottle, 12oz. Definitely on the black side this one, both aroma-, appearance- and flavorwise. Its oily on the pour, black in the body and the only thing preventing it from a perfect five is the minimal sized tan head. Coffee, dark chocolate and some hints of licorice blends nicely in the aroma. The flavor is nice too, but not at the same level although quite similar. On the dark, malty side that is. Bitter, roasted finish, almost ashtray-like. A bit thin on the body, else fine on the palate. A rather lovely beer that needs more body. 100917","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

168,"2010-12-02",4.1,"12oz bottle. Pours a black body with a finger-width, dense and frothy, brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is deep roasts, soft and creamy chocolates, caramel and molasses, fresh coffee, nuts, a touch of vanilla and biscuit, and a few dark fruits. I get just a hint of grassy hop as this warms a bit more too. Really nice aroma. Flavor is very roasty with some char, bittersweet chocolates, piney hops, coffee, nuts, caramel and molasses, and a light licorice. Finishes dry, hoppy, and roasty with a touch of sharpness. Medium, bright bitterness accentuated by the very dry, somewhat charred roasts. Very clean though. Very lengthy aftertaste following a medium, somewhat oily body and moderate, somewhat lively carbonation. Overall, my kind of porter. Very dry and roasty with a nice, piney hop presence.

Mouthfeel has a creaminess to it that interests longer than the lightweight body would suggest.  Flavor really opens with initial ash and bakers chocolate bitterness, soon melding with sexy underlying fudge and almost a hint of dark cherry.

Taste picks up some on the roastiness, very much a roasty malt, along with the pine, which is sharper than it was in the nose. As it warms, it takes on more of a coffee flavor, and its sort of an office coffee taste which detracts some. Finish is dry and mineral. Clean.

Lovely aroma of sweet chocolate. Light smore and graham cracker aroma as well. There is a subtle roast flavor, but I would prefer my porters to only have a subtle roast aroma/flavor because the roast can, at times, be a bit caustic. Hm...Im getting a subtle sweet syrup aroma as well. This beer has an awesome nuanced aroma. Wow, nice smooth texture. Light roast at first, but then the hops and roast flavor mix together providing an amazing bitterness that just drives my taste buds insane. Sweet chocolate is there, but that bitterness sets this port apart from the rest. This one carries a nice oily and creamy texture that makes this a very smooth beer. Deep roast flavor is awesome.

Rich but a bit simplistic aroma of black chocolate with minty and grassy hops. Nearly full-bodied with strong notes of chcoalte sauce, cocoa powder, cookies and mint. Long full medium-bitter aftertaste of dark chocolate, brown sugar, crackers, grass, mint, mild black pepper and mild alcohol. Flavorful but a tad too sticky and rough.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","ante"
168,"2009-09-14",3.3,"Bruegala 2009 sampling - Pours a pitch black with a large, light brown head that leaves some fair amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma has an average grainy, burnt note with notes of coffee and toasted malt. Hops provides a  light grassy note with some dark fruit - raisin, prune notes. Flavor is a very strong acidic coffee note with a light dryness to it and lots of burnt malt character and bitter bakers chocolate/dark chocolate flavor. Moderate body and a thin texture with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall I think the coffee character of this brew really detracted from the overall enjoyability of the brew.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

Served on tap at Dark Horse Brewing Company. Appearance is a deep black with a nice roasted brown head. Aromas are heavy roasted malt with a nice dose of roasted coffee bean. Flavors follow suite but the tongue picks up more of a chard flavor. The malt profile is very pleasant. Palate is very dry and moderately full. A real nice beer that I am glad to of tried fresh on tap.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"

The flavor has a touch of chocolate but again is mostly a mild roasted maltiness. There are some hops in there providing an interesting bitterness. Its a clean stout that sticks to roastiness for its character. I wish there was a bit more of this character, but Im just being picky. The mouthfeel is smooth.

Thanks for someone for sending this as a bonus.  Now that it is available locally I may have to pick up a sixer in the future.  While it is not a spectacular porter it is well enough done to merit the roughly $10 price point for six bottles.  I hope more Dark Horse makes it way to Ohio soon.

Aroma / Appearance - The tan thin head and black fluid body contain a mix of smoky chocolate, rich coffee, and maltiness.   It smells much like you would expect a porter to smell, especially one from a brewery who knows what they are doing.

Flavor / Palate - Smoke, bittersweet chocolate, and an intense roasty aspect form the base of a solid experience.  Without being over the top in coffee grounds it gives a smooth espresso-like flavor to the finish.  At 7.5% ABV it is very drinkable and worth investigating further.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Has an oily look and dissipates within a minute to a thin film. Chocolate notes on the palate. Rather light formation of Belgian lace. Nice lingering. Medium body. Not as dense as the color and pour suggested. Subdued roasted notes. Hints of coffee. Some bitter hops. I like it, but am not overly impressed. I expected more ale yeast character.

Flavor is dark roast coffee, rich dark chocolate, loads of roast, an odd nip of blackberry, plums, a hint of fresh cut grass, a little earthy smoke. Toffee, roasted nuts, lighter roast malt, caramel and bitter hops to finish. Palate is medium thickness with a lightly syrupy feel and a slightly too sharp level of carbonation.

Too sweet, too much body..too much everything to be a lager. But its tasty I know that much. The beer pours out a deep black color with a rich, creamy 1/2"" tan head. Swirling my glass, the beer has some really nice legs to boot. The aroma is very roasty, with lots of dark chocolate, anise and vanilla. Flavor had almost too much ""ash"" flavor of black patent malt, but rides the edge of just enough and too much. Black patent can be overused but someone restrained themselves enough not to go completely overboard. Coffee and chocolate round out the flavor with some molassess and subtle boozy vanilla hints creep up. But a very enjoyable beer.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Waves of dark chocolate and toasted wheat bread appear over just the tiniest amount of fruitiness, perhaps dark berries.  Some char and burnt aromas are also noted.  Flavor is intensely roasty with notes of bitter, dark chocolate.  Quite intense flavor really.  The intensity might reach over to astringency, honestly, as the burnt toast flavor affects drinkability.  Bitterness is a little over the top as well.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Absolutely gorgeous aroma of roasted malt, coffee, espresso, supporting sweet alcohol, supporting bittering hops, working well with the coffee notes, giving them different edges. Nothing too fancy, but just everything Id want in a robust porter. Flavor works together marvelously as well, bitter chocolate, sweet coffee ice cream, perfect alcohol presence. A stand-out in a category where beers are apt to get muddled in with the masses. Mouthfeel is creamy yet airy and silky at the same time. Again, just what Im looking for, full-bodied and superbly drinkable. Is it a 5 in appearance?

How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed about six months after receiving it from my man WeeHeavySD.  Thanks a lot Jon.
The look: Black body topped by a tan ring of foam
In long: Molasses and black chocolate with high cacao content (the kind of 90%+ cacao black-chocolate).  Medium roastiness.  The strong cacao presence gives the beer a dry and floury sensation.  Its like they have used roasted black chocolate bars (if such a thing even makes sense) to make the beer.  A light lemony hops presence just isnt enough.  A little alcohol in the end once the beer as warmed up.  It is tasty and has a lot of oomph but overall the beer comes out as a simple mesh of two basic flavours and to tell you the truth the last few sips of my bottle were getting hard to enjoy.

168,"2008-06-01",4.1,"I picked this 12oz bottle up back in Michigan-enjoyed back in Ireland. 

Pours pitch black, and a bit thick-very enticing. There is a small 1/2 finger cream colored head that fades to lacing around the glass.

The smell hits you right away and its roasty, chocolatey, and coffees. It is really great and between the appearance and smell it really gets you ready to taste it. 

Very smooth, plenty of chocolate and coffee tones in the taste as it goes down. There is a bit of earthiness and smokiness as some other reviewers have indicated, but its mostly all chocolate and coffee. 

Theres enough carbonation to let you notice it, but it doesnt dominate and feels good in your mouth. It isnt as full as you might expect if you judge it straight from its pour, but its great to the last drop. 

Ill definitely recommend this to others and try to get my hands on another the next time that I see it. It reminds me of a couple of Foudners beers and thats always nice for me.","Dublin, IRELAND","jspruit"

Wow this is good - flavors of sweet dark chocolate, roasted malt, black coffee bitter aftertaste, and yes hops as an afterthought.

This looks much like an RIS or a porter.  Smell is of roasted coffee and malts with a bit of chocolate and sweet dark fruits.  Really nice aroma.  First taste is of sweet chocolate malts and caramel before giving way to a roasted coffee taste.  Finish is fairly crisp with hops and coffee bitterness lingering a bit.

168,"2008-03-08",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. Coffee and berry scents dominate the aroma. The smell reminds me of coffee with a healthy dose of cream and sugar as well as fruit-flavored syrup. Fruity and floral. Licorice, red grape, and the tangy scent of roasted coffee beans. Pours a rich dark brown with a maroon tint and a dark copper hue. I believe the liquid is clear, but it is so dark and thick as to appear to be opaque. Small amount of short-lasting, thin, sable-colored head. Good lacing, especially for a beer with so little head. Upon the first sips, dark, roasted coffee dominates. The beer fortunately mellows considerably upon multiple sips, but it remains too coffee-like for my tastes. The later sips feature vanilla, sweet fruit, powdered sugar, and milk chocolate in addition to coffee, making this brew fall into the rich dessert beer niche. Complex flavor profile overall. Roasted coffee finish and long, dry, bitter, similar aftertaste. Full body; thick in texture as well as appearance. Oily and lively in the palate. The coffee aftertaste is too much, but otherwise the palate effects are very good. Dark Horse Reserve Special Black Bier Ale falls squarely into the fruity, English-style ale tradition. It is a love it and hate it beer for me. If the brewers toned down the coffee notes, I think it could be truly great. The bottle I sampled has been sitting in my cellar for several months at least.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

A rich, dark chocolate and caramel mocha nose backs this up, as creamy and full as many big stouts.  Molasses is present as well, adding sweetness to all the roasty goodness.  Flavors are full and rich, with caramel, chocolate, charred oak, and creamy mocha.  The roastiness really sticks to the roof of the mouth, leaving behind lingering charred flavors.  Medium-full bodied and silky, this one feels really good in the mouth.  This is a damn good porter that could hold its own in a blind tasting with some well known stouts.

168,"2008-02-08",3.9,"Bottle purchased at Crown Liquors #15, in Fishers, IN. Appropriately named, this beer pours jet black with a small, creamy, dark tan head that laces nicely. Before the head settles, I got a rather unpleasant wet dog aroma wafting up from the glass. Bleh. After it settles, however, the nose is quite nice: roasted malt, chocolate, and sweet, nutty coffee creamer. (Were it not for the initial Fido aroma, this would have gotten a ""9"" from me.) The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and super-slick (almost as though it were nitrogenated) with a bitter, roasted finish. Roasted dark malt, light cream, char/ash, and a bitter hop hit all combine into a big roasty flavor profile. The aftertaste is a lingering espresso/hop blend. Take a porter, amp up the roast and the bitterness and you have this beer. Its anything but boring, and I would definitely buy it again. Very nice.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

168,"2008-01-28",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2008 Bottle, pours brown black with a thick creamy dark brown head, leaves a slight oily film and fine bubbles for lacing, there was lots of sediment at the bottom of the bottle and I found sediment in my glass, I have never found this much sediment in my glass!?!  Big aroma of dark chocolate, 
sweet chocolate, coffee, some vanilla beans, lots of roasted malt and coffee flavor with chocolate sweet flavor that is not as prominate as the roasted 
malt or coffee, dark brown sugar and molasses flavors that whiff away  (dissipate with the hop bitterness), has a medium or more hop bitterness, 
finish is medium dry that leaves a bitter coffee - almost burnt coffee on the palate, mouth feel is medium to full, I found the aroma to be chocolate but 
the flavor was more roasted malt and coffee, this beer could be a Winter Warmer / After Dinner Sipper but this just needed some more sweetness to 
fall into that catagory, this is the best Porter I have had for the money, I think this stuff borders on an Imperial Porter, it is that good, I highly 
recommend this Porter.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
168,"2008-01-28",4.5,"Ok, first off, It looks eerily similar to darkness from surly. thats as far as ill go with that though. The aroma is Delicious, superbly roasted and toasted malts give off immense flavor and smell.  The initial sip is slightly sweet but very quickly translates into a ultra deep roast, almost Burnt. Hints of chocolate, but mostly heavily roasted coffee and burnt wood. As for the finish its slightly sweet on the tip of the palate nicely balanced towards to middle, and as if finds the way back it becomes burnt and toasty. Finishes quite dry with coffee and burnt wood. Great beer overall. The only negative may be a thin mouthfeel. Nice work Dark!  P.S. drank at nearly room temp.","Minnesota, USA","Mrthirstyneck"

Chocolate malts dance over the roastiness. Mid palate is hints of coffee and mollases. Finishing with that continum of deep roasted malts with well balanced bitter hops and mild creaminess.

I downgraded the appearance, for the lack of head, though I notice the most recent rating claims a ""rick foamy tan head,"" which is similar to the commercial description, so perhaps my bottle wasnt as it should have been.  Otherwise, however, the beer is very good!  Nose is chocolate, a little licorice, and dense bread.  Flavor is rich and full.  Roasty, coffee, and chocolate flavors abound.

Oily black pour with a nice thin head of dark tan silk.  Aroma is a rich dark chocolate and roast. As it warms Im also noticing some dark fruity notes. Nice smooth aroma.  The flavor is just as smooth with plenty of chocolate and some dark fruit sweetness, like natural brown sugar.  Pretty nice.

Reserve Special Black Bier pours black without a hint of light coming through when backlit. A three finger brown head formed on the pour and slowly fell to one finger becoming extremely creamy. Leaves some decent patchy lacing on its way down.

Roasted malts kick things off and lead into a mildly fruity (figs, prunes), nutty aroma. Cocoa shows itself complimenting the nuttiness. Mild alcohol fumes way in the back. Complex and warming.

Roasty malts combine with a mild lactic quality quickly leading into the nuttiness that was present in the aroma. Cocoa and mild brown sugar lead their way to the the finish the cocoa becoming most dominant. A hint of fig peeks in and out throughout the palate.

Heavy body with a smooth silkiness as it slowly works its way over the palate. Becomes slightly gritty on the swallow. Leaves my mouth watering after each sip. 

Good balanced moderate bodied Imperial stout keep this going down easy. I could see myself putting a few of these away on a cold winter evening.

Another high quality brew from Dark Horse. Ive sampled three or four of their offerings (all being darker, heavier styles) and everyone was excellent. I said it before and Ill say it again to the brewers at Dark Horse...Please find a distrubutor in Chicagoland.

Black malt is thick and powerful, lending an earthy, pure cocoa flavor.  Very dry with a distant intimation of lemon and even orange zest.  Steamed vegetal edges along the inside of the popcorn bag.

168,"2007-07-08",3.1,"Pours with a reasonably tightly beaded, full, creamed chocolate, brown colored head that is initially three-fingers in height.  The head leaves a distinct lacing pattern on the sides of my glass as I work my way through this beer.  The beer is an almost black color, with perhaps some dark amber notes to it.  The aroma has notes of chocolate, dusty roast grain husks, toasted malt and a nice burnt, yet still sweet, raisin note to it towards the end.  Interesting, after rooting around in the aroma for a bit I notice a distinct, yet subtle note that reminds me of wood, smoked malt or perhaps butterscotch; I am not sure which, but it is certainly noticeable and now I cant seem to not notice it.

Light feeling as it first hits the tongue, it picks up a medium fullness to it as it moves across the tongue.  The finish is marred by an astringent, sharp, almost harsh burnt bitter note, that is thankfully not too overwhelming.  Notes of bitter, French Roast, black coffee, darkly toasted bread, a burnt acidity, and a acrid char flavor.  This beer has a ton of darkly roasted grain character, it is actually a bit much, but on the upside I think that it is helping to hide some off flavors that are derived from a bit of diacetyl and perhaps some vegetal notes.  In the end the dark malt is just a bit too much, if the gravity was bumped up a bit it might be more in balance.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

THe first sips, though, are very powerful with chocolate malts. But the finish! Oh man, the finish is gorgeously dry, going right to the edge but not too much.

It has a rich mocha aroma with some pure malt notes and just a faint hint of wood and dark spice. The flavor is very fresh espresso and cocoa up front, and then a distinct ashiness. Not like charcoal, but like charred firewood. Some sweet raisin notes float around, too, before some piney bitterness comes into play. The pine bitterness and some bitter cocoa notes make the finish slightly drier than the rest of the sequence of flavors, but the aftertaste gains a rich sweetness reminiscent of chocolate-covered-cherries along with another strong burst of ash.

168,"2007-05-28",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2007 4/23/2007:  Dark Horse Reserve Special Black Bier is near black in color and pours clear.  There is a good-sized foamy brown head the slowly collapses and leaves a frothy dark tan crown on the beer.  Thick foamy lacing with brown speckles cover the glass almost from beginning to end.  Semi-sweet chocolate, some alcohol, and delicate char (nice complexity) can be found in the very nice aroma.  The flavor contains heavily roasted malts, dark chocolate, and coffee.  The flavor isnt really that sweet and it has a perfectly balanced bitterness from all the roasted malts.  The roastiness is like dry roast all the the way to just before being burnt; its just perfect!  The finish has a wonderful milky/creamy dry cocoa and espresso flavor.  There is no alcohol detectable in the flavor.  The body of this beer is full and it feels very smooth in the mouth.

These guys overall seem to lean toward the flat, watery, and ashy, which arent big selling points in my mind, but I can see that people dig them and I respect that.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Update: Mouthfeel not as thin as I originally thought (first sampled at tasting).  However, the finish seems to be a little acrid, which is really my only complaint about the beer.  That and the mouthfeel is a little puckering/tannic at time.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","jvmiller"
168,"2007-05-16",4.0,"Big fan!  Dark dark dark oil black, into impy stout territory with almost no head.  The nose is fantastic.  Chocolate hits first, with some coffee roast and even some charcoal.  A bit sweet, but not into Founders breakfast stout territory.  In a way, I like that slightly better.  A little bit of berry to floral sort of hops.  A bit creamy.  The palate is marked by a very subdued carbonation and still a creamy smooth mouthfeel.  The roast comes out more in the flavor profile, but the chocolate is still rather strong.  Floral hops appear.  A bit drier than I would have guess from the nose, a bit of fitting diacetyl making this melt on the mouth.  A creamy finish with soem fruit becomign char by the end.  I could start seeing myself buying sixers of this stuff.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

A little bit of toffee is noticed as well. Medium-heavy mouthfeel on this one. Very nice, highly roasty flavor here. Its extra roasty with big coffee flavor and a nice smooth chocolate presence to balance, but not dominate. This tasty beer suggests dark toasted rye bread, espresso, chocolate. This was a mighty fine surprise given the somewhat ambiguous label. Im taking my time with this one and the warmer portions towards the end of the glass are very nice. Much more bitter, espresso notes develop and the chocolate character really comes out. Things start to get a little sticky in a satisfying way. Very nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Very generous aroma: sweet nougat and caramel up-front, with a steady backdrop of milk chocolate and vanilla.  Medium-to-full, roasted mouthfeel: relaxed carbonation, keeping this beer tremendously drinkable; plenty of roasted malts and nougat; creamy caramel and vanilla; the taste is more sweet than roasted, but shows a great balance and density; hints of bitter citrus.

Nose is a touch of roast malt over brown bread, with an excellent hint of candied fruit. Excellent broad spectrum of malt flavors. Manages to be both subtle and complex. Bit of leafy hop as it warms. Great stuff!

Complexity carries through to the palate, where the dark, bready malt leads the way, but is well-supported by yeasty, chocolately, and coffee notes. Medium-full in the mouth, but there is excellent acidity to keep it balanced. Very long.

Drier flavor than the aroma suggests - bitter roasted malt, burnt coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a little bit of prune. A bit of an ashy aftertaste, but not too much.

It is deep with roast, burnt notes and a fair degree of hops, akin to a Rogue stout.  The palate suggests more body that a porter, quite clearly.  The palate is luscious and compelling, though the bitterness of the finish prevents this from being a ""fast drinker"".  Still, it is a well crafted brew, whatever its style.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Good start, poured a opaque blackish brown with a foamy, fluffy tan head that settled into a thin foamy, skim-like lacing, good laced sticking.

Aromas of roasted barley and malts, molasses and a berry fruitiness, and a subtle herbal hoppiness. Also light whiffs of alcohol.

Good moderate stout carbonation and a crisp, dryish, slick and creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.

Big tastes of roasted barley and grains, a coffee maltiness, a berry fruitiness, raisins and prune juice, molasses sweet, a light herbal spicy hoppiness, the alcohol shows up towards the end giving the taste a bit of a bite, and a dry roasted malty finish.

This one has a great nose of raisons, something else sweet that my inadequate descriptive abilities cant peg, and some roasted malt. Tan thin head on top of jet black beer. Very roasty and a little too thick. This is no porter, more of an Imperial Stout if you ask me. Had some alcohol on the back end that wasnt quite enjoyable.

Burnt dark chocolate, coffee, and soy come on heavy at the front of the palate with herbs, anise, and alcohol pushing through the back end.

Full dark chocolate and bitter coffee flavors. The best thing is that the bitterness mellows to just a mild acidic dry cleansing finish. Full and rich feel that gets thinned out a touch by the black malt acidity. Depending on the time this one ""swills"" about the mouth, the bitterness varies. If you take a quick hit, the bitterness is less pronounced and only a short after thought. Let the brew set on the tongue and the acid oozes out and dries the tongue and wears the palate out.

This is followed up by a ton of flavour - more roast, this time more coffee like, dry bakers chocolate, and a good dose of hops.  Seems thinner at first before exploding into a robust body.

Pours a powerful viscous black with a modestly-sized deep brown head and abundant lacing.
 The beer provides a nice big aroma: roasting coffee, dark plums, molassas, and a hint of smoke. The smoke dominates my first impression of the flavor, coming on much harder than expected with a taste of smoked almonds tinged throughout with tendrils of sweet dark malt, plenty of fruit rounding out the late middle of the sip, and bittering into a lovely hopped finish still fronting plenty of thai-iced-coffee sweetness. The mouthfeel is plain perfect. 
Darn Im impressed by this beer and I wish I could get it on a regular basis.

Taste was much more bitter than I expected, not near as much spice in the flavour, mostly burnt chocolate and coffee roastiness followed by a big kick of bitter resiny hops on the longish finish; unfortunately, there was an increasing tang of bottle metal as it warmed - maybe a less than fresh bottle?  This had a very muscular body - more like an Impy Stout than a porter - with a flat, acidic quite complex mouthfeel - terrific beer, if this is really a porter, one of the best Ive had - would like to try it again with a guaranteed fresh bottle to compare.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

168,"2005-11-29",4.0,"Pours thick black with small but compact brown head.  Roasted and chocolate malts and a hint of coffee in the aroma.  Very bold, nice assortment of aromas.  The initial flavor is an up front malt sweetness, and were it not followed by a solid roasted and coffee malt and a coffee and hop led bitterness, it would be too sweet.  Fortunately the mentioned malts and bitterness give it a very nice ballance.  As it warms it gets a more gritty roasted malt but continues with the strong sweetness.  Nice finish, mostly leaving a roasted flavor in the mouth.","Zionsville, Indiana, USA","atpayne"

168,"2005-08-08",3.8,"Surprise bottle courtesy of styles: Totally opaque black in the glass with a small, yet thick and lasting, brown head that lasts.  The aroma actually shows a slight hops scent if served way too cold (which I did then let it warm up).  Once its reached the proper temperature notes of sweet toffee, chocolate, de-bittered roasted malt, earthy coffee, cinnamon, cookie dough, and a hint of diacetyl.  I dive in.  It turns out that my nose did not deceive me - there appears to be more hops in here than the average porter.  At first I get a hint of citrus/pine & alcohol mixed with a roasted coffee.  Then the beer opens up to show black pepper, roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate, charred tree bark, charcoal covered in molasses.  Full bodied, oily & thick, sticky in the mouth.  Finishes with bitter roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of hops on the tongue.  If I had to guess Id say there was some columbus or cascade in this one along with some british hops, which provides an interesting contrast to the roasted malt - similar to a well-hopped imperial stout (alpha-klaus, but less hops).

Similar to gonzo I guess but the dark horse has way less hops.  Aroma is intense with chocolate malt, rich caramel, and a lot of nuts.  Flavor is also nutty with a ton of chocolate to it.

168,"2005-07-05",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2006 Freshly distributed bottle, August 2006.
Thick black pour with a preceding minimal hiss from the cap being lifted.  Splotchy and large tan bubbles circle the wrung as a mahogany lightened edge shines through.  Deep dark treats transcend aromatics.  Black turtle fudge, tar, espresso grinds and bitter, unsweetened bakers chocolate all take turns at seducing the sniffer. Flavor brings out an even more bittered edges, cutting and cunning the tongue as it weaves through the unsweetened chocolate and licks from the espresso press.  Cinder and ash fill in the periphery as dry bitterness suckles the back attachments of the tongue.  Fanatically black  in flavor, in fire, and in force.  Charming devilry, maintaining a medium-to-fuller body with a bitter black licorice line dragged through burnt rubber on asphalt.  Scorched cocoa is a generate of the coffee bitterness and black patent balance, trailing into bittersweet misgivings amidst stark chocolate bricks and charred crème brûlée.

On tap at the brewery, July 2005.  Wondrously opaque and black in color.  Deepest tan, creamy head Ive ever seen.  Smell is fantastic - charcoal, dark chocolate, burnt malts and charred crusted peppers.  Holy hell, weve achieved nirvana.  Complimentary bitter notes dance atop the finest barista blended espresso and dark chocolate flavors.  Singed, earthy and laden with the dark elements.  Absolutely to die for.

Fresh, smoky and slightly harsh wood flavor, prickly on the tongue, with an appreciated bite and ""youth"" to it all... like I can taste the wood itself.  Finish contains more of the milk chocolate that was noted in the aroma, along with a mild butterscotch.  A very pleasing beer to drink, and worthy of it’s high marks.

This brew was a little too cold when I started, and although I could immediately sense its quality, the flavors are only now coming out with a few minutes of warming. Really, perfectly balanced. Has some solid bitterness, which to me is essential in a top porter. Wow, is this good and I am continually shocked at how different beers can taste at different temps.

Aromas were amazing, big nose of coffee/espresso, roasted malts, slight earthiness, and sweet vanilla notes in the background.  Definately made me excited to take a sip.  Flavor doesnt disappoint in the least, balanced with a lot going on.  Up front are what you would expect after smelling this one, lots of coffee and other roasted flavors, but out of nowhere come the hops (slightly overbalanced with the malted characteristics but appreciated none the less).  The balance doesnt end there however, even into the dry hop finish, which lingers then disappears to reveal the espresso notes present  long after swallowing.  Mouthfeel was very soft and full.  Dark Horse finally brews something in the same league as their IPAs.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","Brad"

Honestly, I think the godawful graphic design on this label means this sits too long and you end up w/ old bottles. 

I wasnt expecting this to be so strong. Pours an oily black with only a wisp of head. Nose is big and rich with a bit of coffee, chocolate and a hoppy sort of funk. Lack of carbonation creates the  impression of thinness wich really detracts from the overall richness. Taste follows aroma mostly with a touch of astringency.

Tastes roasty toasty dark malty, with big chocoff, some rauchiness, some licorice, some blackberries.  I figured this for an Impy stout, or an elite regular stout.

168,"2004-09-23",4.3,"Entirely opaque black. Creamy and persistent light bronze foam. Colossal aroma of cocoa, espresso, ink, and blackberries. Hint of earthy black malt and developing  phenols. Tight, velvety carbonation. Slick body. Fresh cocoa and coarse roasty flavors atop a cocoa and rich espresso bedding. Trace oxidation.  Intensely acrid, throughout, with burnt matchsticks and seared  black malts. Attains most of its bitterness from the brisk char, which also creates a drying effect, while highlighting the espresso and muted hop presence. Bittersweet chocolate briefly offsets the acridness. Extremely woody finish of salted licorice and burnt black chocolate. Perhaps the most burnt-flavored Stout Ive ever tasted. Hardly a Porter, but more of an Imperial Stout than anything else. Either way, its a glorious brew, despite the phenols and oxidation.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Aroma is low-keyed and mellow with what seems to be quite a heft of black malt roastyness, partailly sweet with a mollasses undertone, hints of deep dark espresso beans and dark chocolate keep the nose happy. 

Sip....whoa! Wasnt expecting that! Wow, what a mega assault of blackened roasty stuff. Starts smooth and subdued with sweeter roasted malts with caramel, licorice, and molasses, then it gets all crazy with mega blackened malts and grains, earthy, smokey, charcoal effervescence and bittering coffee/espresso roast tones and pungent dry hop leaves. What an absolutely fantastic finish. That black roast makes itself a home across the entire palate. Oh so nice to let it just sit there and dry out the tongue. Its like taking a larger, fuller sip of espresso but its cold. Very nice appeal as far as thats concerned. The hops make for a nice meld in the finish as well. 

Feel is quick to start, slick creamy front, bold, richly robust, nearly full once it procedes past midway and the finish is a fuckin treat of roasty blackened stuff, very dry and coating with a long ever-lasting burntish quality. I may just be tasting this stuff the rest of the day.

168,"2004-03-06",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2004 2003 bottle. Pours extremely dark brown/black with lots of dark caramel/roasted colored head around the edges.  Bottle conditioned.  Small amount of head remains.  Smells very oily, thick roast and lightly chocolatey, with some fresh hops in the background.  Similar to the Oktoberfest in its abundant use of fresh moderately spicy hops, but unlike it in its extreme use of roasted barley.  Some mild, bitter chocolate notes and some sweeter sugary flavors as well.  The flavor was quite good with my biggest complaint being a bit too much thinning and some astringency from the dryness and flavor get a bit dull due to all of the roast.  Good offering for sure, though.  2003 bottle aged an additional number of months.  This one had the creamiest, most luxurious, velvety head Ive seen in a while.  Much more balanced than I rememeber, probably the hops flavor evening out.  Rich and smooth, but still has plenty of good roasty bitterness.  Seemed a touch thin on the end exacerbated by the huge bitterness, but I also drank this thing at about 65 degrees so that probably didnt help.  Uppin the score on this though, it deserves it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

168,"2002-09-16",2.7,"Deep dark brown in color ... resembles a porter or stout.  Tons (too many in my opinion) of suspended yeast blobs.  Flavor is dominated by roasted malts ... I have had dry stouts with less roasted flavor!  Rich and buttery, but not that impressive as a whole.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
168,"2002-09-15",1.6,"Nice chocolate and coffee aroma with a strong roasted malt finish.  A bit of an overshoot on the roasted malt though... which tends to override the complexity of the beer.  I think I need a sample from on-premise to back up my review.  Lets go...","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Scotsman99"
168,"2002-08-28",4.1,"Strong roasty plummy aroma.  Very dark opaque black, and extra dark brown head.  Rich roasty flavor with dry med bitter finish.  Smooth.  Some chocolate notes in there too.  I cant believe this was really 8%?  Its definitely one of the boldest stouts Ive ever had.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
168,"2002-08-27",4.3,"Dark jet black color, roasted coffee aroma, black burnt plum-coffee flavor, very burnt,dry and bitter lasting finish. I put my money on this Dark Horse, this is a winner! Thanks PsychProf for this underrated killer beer.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
168,"2002-08-18",4.2,"Okay, I think I was spoiled by the first beer I tried of theirs, Trois Blueberry stout.  This beer is almost identical in flavor, and very good I may add, but lacks the blueberries, of course.  Its black, oily, and goes down quite well.  Im liking this brewery more and more.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","Jfishback13"
168,"2002-07-31",4.4,"black colour, fine creamy head, deep coffey aroma, blackberries, black chocolate, cinnamon, roasted, oily, full-bodied, sweet with a strong bitterness, the finish is long, coffeish and bitter - a monument ! - Thanks to PsychProf for this great beer !","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
168,"2002-07-01",3.7,"Wow - very dark color - motor oil like. Pours with tightly carbonated very dark borwn head - one of the darkest heads Ive seen. Bakers chocolate and hoppy nose - smells like a porter to me. Chewy palate - thick. BIG, HUGE flavors of bittersweet/dark chocolate, roasted/burnt coffee and bitter hoppy notes. Tastes like a West Coat hoppy porter to me. This beer has huge flavors which I like, but is a bit over-the-top in terms of its bitterness. Still, give it props for the bold flavor profile.","Orange County, California, USA","bigal9699"
168,"2002-06-25",3.2,"I definitely agree with this beers characterization as a Porter, despite the bottle calling it a black bier ale.  The roastiness, bitterness and thickness of the malt bely its true nature.  But I beg to differ with Joe (user_experience) about the hand-drawn dark horse on the label.  It is my studied belief that the equine animal in question is indeed a horse - just one with particularly long ears.  Only the artist knows for sure.  As for the beer, its BITTER.  Moreso than a lot of porters, so it surprised me a tad.  A quality malty brew thats almost in stout territory.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
168,"2002-06-11",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2003 Rerate: I have to refine my feelings on this one after repeated retastings. The aroma is fairly standard for a good porter; more roasty than sweet. The taste, however, has distinct development. It starts chocolate sweet, but not syrupy, for just a short time, than turns roasted, then some hops and dark maltiness come in. Long lasting, lip smacking finish, with some back of throat stickiness that would usually detract, but doesn't somehow. Original: 12/14/01: The rating here is an average of the bottled version and the on tap version I had on a great trip to the brewery with Hennes. In bottle, the brew was fine, nice malts and molasses notes. On tap, chocolate came through more strongly, yet everything was very balanced. Good body/mouthfeel. Oh, and I got a personalized Three Floyds sampler six along with this beer and the Boffo Brown. What a great day!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
168,"2002-06-10",4.0,"Black in color. Very roasty and bitter. Also a bit fruity. Much like a stout.","FLINT, Michigan, USA","pauliefrog99"
168,"2002-05-27",3.5,"Looks like Im the only person to rate this beer so far that didnt get the beer from PsychProf besides Hennes. Thats because I got it from Hennes. Not a bad beer. Theres actually a lot of citrusy hops for a porter since the darker, maltier beers tend to just eat the hop flavors and you can really pick them up in this beer. On the appearance, it really comes closer to a stout than a porter, but the flavor and aroma really fit in with the porter style. This beer gives me the impression that this brewery could really do some good stuff.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
168,"2002-04-13",3.4,"The dark horse is actually a hand-drawn ass on the label. Very black 26+ SPN, chocolate-colored sparkling foam, roasty and a mite lactic, particulate feel, some light fruity/yeasty esters. Lasting deep carmels and a bit of bitter licorice. Much thanks to Psych_Prof!","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
168,"2002-03-25",3.8,"Dark as midnight with a gorgeous brown head. Nose is filled with dark/roasty malts,subtle chocolate and coffee notes. Medium to full bodied with definite porter/stout qualites. Smooth malts laced with chocolate along with strong hopping making for a powerful bitterness.(Maybe a bit too much?)  Good stuff. Thank you psychprof.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
168,"2002-03-25",3.9,"Extremely black. Very roasty, very malty, very bitter. Full bodied with salty licorice flavour. Is this a schwarzbier on steroids or baltic style porter? Id say the latter, but in any case it is a good beer.
Thanks PsychProf for sending me this rare beer!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
168,"2001-12-22",4.0,"This is the best Dark Horse brew that Ive tried - very rich with caramel and especially nice roasty accents.  The high ABV is noticeable, but in a spicy, dark and warm accent way.  Well done!

Added comment: My original review was for the draft version - in the bottle all the other flavours succumb to the huge roasted flavour, which is fine by me, as I love the taste, but may turn others away.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
