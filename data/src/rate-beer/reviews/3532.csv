3532,"2015-04-30",3.6,"Aroma is dry/biscuit malts, earthy and a small hint of citrus. The flavor is caramel/toffee, malts, fruit and a mildly tart/sour finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
3532,"2015-04-29",3.7,"Something about this beer that I really like. The taste is much better than I expected, especially from a mild ale. Caramel malts, hop spice, bready, mild yeast, medium body, nutty, faint dark fruit aroma. Different and good.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
3532,"2015-03-08",2.9,"Bottle. Odd beer. Pretty boozy for a mild, and it does come across. Malty, bready, some cocoa, palate has a little heft. Meh.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
3532,"2015-03-07",3.4,"Has a boozy, almost chocolatey aroma. Flavor follows suit. A bit strong on the ABV for a mild ale. Good carbonation. Some slight bitterness. Pleasant, if unremarkable, beer.","Missouri, USA","kdm1984"
3532,"2015-03-06",3.5,"Tap at The Lowry. Copper color. Some caramel and malt in the aroma. Medium sweet malt and grain flavor. Has a thick and heavy palate for a mild and far too much alcohol. Enjouqble beer anyway.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3532,"2015-02-28",3.4,"Pour on tap at Red Cow, clear orange pour with thin white head, aroma brought nice biscuit, dough, toast, hints of orange peel into some grainy notes, slight honey into some grass. Taste was a mix of orange, grass, slight herbal notes into a bit of biscuit, dough, husky note with a touch of grain, finishing slightly sweet. Not sure about a 7.2% mild, but it is a decent beer.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
3532,"2015-02-18",4.0,"Deep Amber with great thick head. Faint toasted malt aroma. Great mild ale, pleasant bready and caramel flavor. Balanced and drinkable. Definitely holds up well as it warms.

3532,"2015-01-29",2.9,"I dont know about this one. It started out nice, some maltiness, an odd smokiness I couldnt quite place. But a few sips in it was a bunch of flavors I couldnt quite place and didnt really enjoy. It might have just been the night as it seemed unique, but not really for me at the time.","Mount Vernon, Iowa, USA","GJF"
3532,"2015-01-05",3.5,"12oz bottle. Filtered copper-amber body. Creamy off-white head. Inoffensive, sort of bland aroma. Bready, thick malt tones, but the filtration keeps it pretty drinkable. In no way a traditional English style mild, but not a bad beer, the malt tones are quite pleasant and rich, almost oaky. Its really something along the lines of an ""imperial"". The hops give it some pleasant balance. Enjoyable.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
3532,"2015-01-04",4.2,"Poured from a bottle into a pub pint glass. Amber color, 1 inch cream white head that lingers. As it recedes, it leaves sticky lacing. Low to moderate carbonation. Malty aroma a bit bready with some fruit. Malt initial taste, just a bit roasty with fruity presence also, transitioning to bitter, bready aftertaste. Definitely English in the balance. Feel is initially tingly/ bitter with a thickish texture. It is a very good English-style mild, in spite of being too high in ABV for the style. It does not in any way taste boozy, however. Ill be stocking up on this one before it disappears forever, and perhaps Ill cellar a couple of sixers, too, as Summit suggests. Once again, Summit nails it with the Union series. Congrats to Summit brewer Damian McConn!","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"
3532,"2015-01-03",3.2,"Bottle. Rich copper body with a light khaki head. Nose is rich with lots of grainy goodness and notes of caramel. There is also some apparent raw bread dough. Strong tobacco notes are dominant up front with hints of spicy dough. The spice is almost like cinnamon type heat, but not quite that flavor it is closer to black pepper. The finish is over steeped tea and raw dough. There is also a little bit of a nutty character throughout each drink. A decent winter warmer, but Summit has done better. In no way is this a mild, it is more like an American Strong Ale.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
3532,"2015-01-02",3.0,"On tap at The Depot Tavern. Pours a clear gold with a near white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has sweet grains with a bit of bread and a touch of toffee. Flavor has lots of bread with earthy grains and a bit of a leafy note.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3532,"2014-12-30",3.7,"Pours a perfect clear amber with huge off-white head that lasts and leaves great lacing. Aroma is lightly toasted malts, hint of chocolate. Taste is herbal, mildly roasted caramel malts with faint hints of coffee. Earthy and nutty in the aftertaste. Sticky finish with drying palate and well-hopped for the style. Not bad!","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"
3532,"2014-12-22",3.1,"Bottle - small foamy head, nice dark copper/Amber color, sweet and very nutty malty aroma and flavor, surprisingly big earthy hop spice too, mild alcohol notes, almost a little too strong actually

3532,"2014-12-21",3.7,"Pours copper large white head. Aroma is biscuit, yeast, and herbs. Flavor is earthy hops, biscuit and yeast notes, grain, herbs, and light chocolate notes with some alcohol on the finish. Medium body with medium carbonation. Very good.","East Bethel, Minnesota, USA","bluemooner"
3532,"2014-12-14",3.4,"Draft. Poured clear amber color with an average fizzy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate complex hop and malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3532,"2014-12-13",3.8,"Bottle. Copper pour, beige head - good retention, lacing. Aroma has very nice notes of toasted caramel, rising dough, mild yeast. Flavor is spot on - tastes like a - notes of bread pudding, strawberries, mild cocoa, backed by herbs and a lingering, assertive hop resin that reminds me of ESBs or darker bitters of UK - at first I was suspicious of the use of invert sugar, and I had one cold and was not impressed, but had this sample at around 55 degrees F, which I think made all the difference in the way the sugars exhibited themselves. A beautiful seasonal and a brilliant concept.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"
3532,"2014-12-13",3.6,"On tap at Dutchs. Caramel malt, dark fruit, touch of vanilla. Kind of toasty. Not bad flavor at all. Medium to bigger body. Super smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Lightly slick. Kind of a nice, full, creamy feel to it. Clear amber color, with an off-white head, leaving great thicker reaches of lace. Moderate bitter taste, moderate sweet. Really nice full-bodied balanced english-style ale. Better than expected.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3532,"2014-12-12",3.4,"Pours a copper with a slightly off white head. Aroma is bready, biscuity with hints of caramel and burnt caramel, maybe some treacle. Taste is biscuity up front with some nice caramel, slight toffee notes. Slight grain, slightly bitter floral hops. Nice medium body to match the 7.2% ABV which is slightly noticeable at first. Nice drinkable beer, interesting take on the style.","Fargo, North Dakota, USA","Maltser85"
3532,"2014-12-06",3.8,"355ml bottle. Amber pour. Aroma is a great melange of malt scent,s toasty, roasty, bready, its all here, slight hops too. Flavor is deep and malty, slght davory note, hops as a background, waves of malty goodness, crackery, dry, which it was a touch lower in abv but otherwise a pleasant beer and wish english beers in general could travel like this.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3532,"2014-11-28",3.3,"Pours a copper color with a large head. Aroma of biscuit and light chocolate. Light herbal and earthy hop notes. Fairly strong alcoholic flavor at first. Strong graininess. Mild yeast character. Some bitterness, but more like astringency from the grains. Very light floral hops. Full bodied.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
