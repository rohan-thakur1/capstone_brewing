666,"2017-03-12",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Deglet nour dates slowly turn to toffee, while black grapes meet toasted wood in this complex, cohesive Barrel-Aged Scotch Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy ruby-tinged brown.
-A light acidity touches the finish, fitting perfectly with the rest of the flavour profile.
-Alcohol notes are obvious, but are well supported by malt character.
-The dried fruit/raisins in the finish are lovely.

Ça peut jouer jen conviens. Bien moins équilibrée, celle-ci présentait un profil tannique qui ne me convenait pas. Plutôt mince et agressive, les saveurs de porto sont subtiles mais sagencent tout aussi mal avec le caramel boisé.

Had a taster of this when I picked up my bottles in March and thought it was really good (4.25 on Untappd). Will be curious how this has aged in only six months, but had to celebrate Barrel-Aged Day, you know? Their BBA Wee Heavy may have been the best beer Ive ever had although the last two times I had tasters were not as good (one of them nitro). Either way, I love barrel-aged beers and especially barrel-aged Wee Heavys. 

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of khaki tan head. Could not see any bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. World-class spiderweb foamy lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled that big Port Wine whiff right away. Was boozy in the beginning, but smoothed out after a few more sniffs. Also got those smooth Wee Heavy notes though, getting caramel, toffee, a touch of butterscotch and what smelled like bourbon (although its Port, so maybe just a wish). Digging deeper got tobacco, prune, dried fruit, red Sherry wine, oaky vanilla, dark black cherry and plum. (Smell - 4.50)

Tasted that Port Wine, dried fruits, prune, plum, raisins, red Sherry wine, red grapes, leathery tobacco, toffee, caramel and vanilla. Want to say bourbon, but not sure how that is possible. Oaky, but not as much as the nose. Maybe some crayon in there as well. Not quite as good as the nose. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, earthy finish. (Feel - 3.75)

This was pretty good. I guess about as good when I initially rated it on Untappd. I really think this is a complex brew though. A lot of different elements here. (Overall - 4.25)

Lots of sweet wine, caramel, and brown sugar. Has a touch of booze to it as well. Nice dark fruit character--sort of a rum raisin thing going on. Lots of cherry, plum, and currant. Definitely on the sweet side, but sort of goes with the territory and isnt too bad.

666,"2016-03-23",3.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this baby at a line share at Witchs Hat on St. Pattys Day. 750 mL bottle that just kind of appeared at our table. The pour is a nice murky brown with a thinner cap of tan head that doesnt leave any lace as it disappears. The aroma is really interesting. There is an absolute ton of wine. There is a light caramel and toffee behind it, but the mainstay is resounding port. Its got a little dark fruit and some decent malt, but everything is taken for a ride by the port barrel. Why the hell do people still do this?! The flavor is pretty similar here. There is a little more barrel character than on the nose, but the wine still controls everything. There is a light dark fruit presence, and some caramel malts. Its got a light booziness on the finish that wasnt really picked up in the nose. The mouth feel is creamy and heavier with a lighter carbonation. The wine is definitely the aftertaste. Meh.
