2482,"2014-12-10",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Caramel sweetness and earthy hops momentarily tag team until malt flavors decide to take over this warming Doppelbock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the hazy dark burgundy.
-Candied fruit appears here and there.
-Carbonation is soft and the residual sugar level is high. Which is about right for the style.
-Malt flavors are a tad linear, which is not uncommon for Doppelbocks.

2482,"2014-09-24",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 9-14-13-

 Served on tap in a point glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a deep murky brown color with a one finger tan head. The head fades rather fast leaving a bit of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is big of sweet caramel and some smells of dark fruits of fig and cherry. The aroma also has a decent toasted malt aroma as well as some notes of chocolate mixed within. Rounding out these smells are some notes of a grassy hop, complimenting the others nicely.

 Taste  The taste begins with a big sweet roasted malt flavor. The sweetness is of a caramel nature upfront with it transitioning to a more brown sugar and molasses sweetness more toward the end. The roasted malt flavor upfront is a mix of brown bread and some toasted malt tastes. Some lighter coffee flavors hit the tongue as well as a rather nice hit of dark fruit flavors more toward the middle of the taste. With a little bit of a herbal taste as well as some alcohol greeting the tongue at the end, taste an overall sweet, roasty, and warming taste is left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is rather midrange. The thick body is very nice for the big sweet and roasty flavors enhancing the warming nature of the brew.

 Overall This one has nice and big sweet flavors with lots of malt. A rather tasty doppelbock that is well worth a try.","","Darkmagus82"

2482,"2013-07-19",3.3,"12 ounce bottle - $2.49 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a very dark brown body, housing a little hint dirtied garnet at the edge against the list. Smallish, light beige head that settles fairly quickly. No appreciable lacing or retention.

Smell: Sweet-scented, alcoholic, with a fruitiness of figs and grape-flavored candy (like Nerds or such), a step ahead of the dark-colored syrup, Tootsie roll, and molasses.

Taste: Molasses, caramel atop toast, and a noted roastiness. Dark syrup sweetness upfront. Rather bright fruitiness, fig and grape, followed by slight, herbal hops and a persistent pinch of alcohol (a bit fusel). Snippet of licorice. Slight nuttiness, with a touch of Tootsie Roll. Drying, rather warming, fruity finish. A little coffee pops into the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Potent in many of its aspect, its not the best doppelbock to be had, though, Im sure you could do worse.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

2482,"2013-02-03",3.0,"12oz bottle into a snifter. Not sure of the age on this but I know it has been in my fridge for a year or so.

Pours a clear dark brown with a slight reddish tint. A very small light brown head is quick to fade leaving a thin ring around the top of the beer.

Aroma is full of brown sugar, caramel, and toffee. There is a slight metallic note which seems a little off to me. There are also some faint grassy aromas. Overall it is pretty weak.

This weakness carries over into the taste which is really quite underwhelming. Plenty of caramel and brown sugar but there is a strong vegetal character which becomes a little off-puting after awhile. It is very DMS like and I almost wonder if this is an unintended flaw. It isnt bad for awhile but it does start to limit drinkability. Alcohol is well-hidden but the mouthfeel is on the watery side.

Overall, I am very unimpressed with this offering from Duck Rabbit. There is just an overall lack of everything from the aroma to the flavor to the mouthfeel. Way too much DMS and a lack of much malt or hops. Maybe this has improved since the batch I got but I really cant recommend.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

2482,"2012-09-16",2.7,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2012 Re-review of 2012 batch. First bottle was an infected mess. 2nd bottle is definitely better. Score will be an average of the two as Im sure there are other infected bottles floating around out there, and infections have become so common for these guys that one pretty much has to expect it going in to any of their beers.

Similar color/clarity, but the head retains much better and leaves more lacing.

Aroma is roasted malts, hints of dark fruit, chocolate, toffee, molasses, grains, bread, a touch smoky. Moderate to good strength.

Flavor is dark malts, somewhat roasted, dark fruits, cherries, raisins, chocolate, caramel, toffee, molasses, some astringent malt bitterness, moderate sweetness for the style, grains, some herbal hops, bit of alcohol, tinge funky.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sticky, creamy, moderate carbonation.

Much better this time around. Hopefully the infection is isolated, but Id definitely recommend drinking these now in case it starts getting worse...

Original Review:  Score 1.6: Aroma 2, Appearance 2, Taste 4, Palate 2, Overall 6

12oz bottle, best by May 2013.  Served at around 55F.

Pours clear brown with red highlights and a one finger brown head that leaves no lacing and recedes to a just a small ring and eventually nothing at all.

Aroma is sour fruit, sweaty gym socks, funky, cardboard, infected mess.  Goddammit Duck-Rabbit.

Flavor is sweet dark malts, dark fruit, sour notes.  Not as funky as the aroma, but the signs of infection are here.  This is only gonna get worse with time.  Definitely got that Duck-Rabbit ""wang"" goin on.

Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied, sticky, very little carbonation.

Maybe I just got a bad bottle, as the reviews are generally positive for this one, but its got all the Infected Duck-Rabbit characteristics going on aside from the gigantic head...in fact this one is nearly flat after the initial pour.  Aroma in particular reminds me a lot of their 2012 Barleywine disaster.  Never had a sour or funky Doppelbock before, so Ive got to assume this is not what the brewer was shooting for.  In an effort to be fair, I will try one more bottle just in case this one was an anomaly and will adjust my review accordingly if needed.  As it stands right now, this is a terrible Doppelbock.  Fought through half the glass, but the rest is going down the drain...","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

2482,"2012-09-07",4.4,"The chestnut colored body clear, and the beige head was fed by gentle carbonation.  The smell was ripe with figs, dates, cherries, and dark raisins.  The taste was not as sweet as I had anticipated.  The malts appeared to be well roasted, giving a bitter coffee effect at first sip.  This was followed by a fruity tartness, semi-sweet powdered cocoa, and a woody, dry finish.  This was a surprisingly complex juxtaposition of flavors for the style.  The body was not as silky smooth as the best examples of the style.  Quite a different experience from others of this style.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

2482,"2011-07-28",4.1,"Thick, rich deep brown coloured body with a cola coloured glow near the bottom and a dense, three centimetre tall orange, copperish tan head - beautiful beer.

Full-bodied; Dense, thick mouthful with a rich malty flavour at first then hits hard with the sugars - brown sugar, molasses and even a hint of vanilla comes through. Aftertaste shows a bit of complexity with caramel showing first, then some fruits, peat and a little chocolate finishing it out.

Poured into a pilsner glass. Color is dark mahogany with a nice tan head and some good retention. The nose is dark fruits, roasted malt, caramel, nuts, chocolate. Really nice and presents an elegant complexity. The taste is the same and some brown sugar mixes well with the fruits and chocolate. Fairly thick body with good carbonation.

2482,"2009-11-30",4.0,"old note: @ Milltown. Great aroma, sweet, fruity, berry, cherry, carmel. Reddish brown color, good head, no lace. Sweet flavor, like aroma, though carmel is more pronounced, not as much of the fruit, littel chocolate kickin around. Medium body, thick creamy mouthfeel, dry sweet finish. Wow, wow, Id still be sniffin this if my wife didnt give me the lets get going speech, ha ha. Wonderful stuff.","the Containment Area, North Carolina, USA","OldGrowth"

Aromas of nuts, chocolate, earhtiness, and some smokiness. Tastes of chocolate, caramel, brown sugary sweetness, and nuts. Some alcohol in the finish.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2482,"2009-09-07",4.2,"Growler courtesy of durhambeer.  Pours dark brown with a tan lasting head.  Smells of fruit, chocolate, spice, earthy, some peaty hints.  Tastes of chocolate, spice, brown sugar, some raisins, a touch of bitterness, peppery, earthy, smoky.  Enjoyable.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
2482,"2009-09-01",3.6,"Thanks to GodofThunder for the growler pour. Pours a deep reddish brown. Very sweet carmrlized sugar suagr and smokinees aroma. Smoky malt, sweet caramel malt dark fruit taste. Very heavy and might be a bit too big for a doppel, but tasty.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
2482,"2009-08-31",3.4,"Draft at City Beverage in Winston-Salem.  Cloudy dark brown with a white head.  Aroma is sweet caramel malt, dark fruits, brown sugar, and alcohol.  Flavor is very sweet and malty with caramel, raisin, chocolate, and brown sugar.  Palate fairly full and syrupy.  Drinkability pretty low, but its a decent beer overall.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
2482,"2009-08-27",3.5,"Good beer, but not really a dopplebock.  Tastes a little more like a scotch ale.  Malty and sweet. It is very good, though.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
2482,"2009-08-21",4.0,"Dark brown pour with decent sized white head.  Very sweet molasses and coffee aroma.  Chocolate malt in the flavor with taste of mocha and maybe slight hops alcohol burn at the end.  Very balanced and tasty.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","chandler0201"
2482,"2009-08-09",3.9,"Much more malty version of this style but I certainly appreciate it. On tap at the brickstore. Murky brown color is not very appetizing. First sniff of this guy and you konw you are in for something sweet and tasty. Baked bread in the aroma and flavor. Most of all though you have chocolate malt dominating. There is a slight cocoa mouth feel towards the finish and almost no hops to speak about here. Malt is the name of this game.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
2482,"2009-08-09",3.6,"On tap at Milltown with emacgee, durhambeer, and Turd. Always nice to see a new beer from DR, and I found this to be a really nice example of the style. Gleaming copper pour, with a moderate head. The nose is quite inviting, with soft fruits, (not too) sweet malts, and a dry nutty quality. Palate could be a bit more bold, but still nice as it lingers. The flavor wasnt quite as complex as some doppelbocks Ive had but was still lively and enjoyable, a good mix of bready grain and playful sweetness. Long smooth finish with a hint of smoke. Keep this one rocking through the winter, guys!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2482,"2009-08-06",3.6,"Draught at Milltown. Pours a very dark clean ruby copper with a two finger tawny tan head. The nose is sweet, caramel malt, raisiny, rich, earthy, mild grain. Flavor has some burnt sugar, mild grain, warm alcohol, caramel, rich, nice malt character. Rich smooth palate with some spicy alcohol. Tasty.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
2482,"2009-08-04",3.6,"Brick Store - Aroma of roasted nuts, caramel and just a hint of lingering smokiness, but that blows off as it warms.  Very sweet candied fruits, sticky caramel and a bit of herbal hoppiness.  Decent and warming.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
2482,"2009-08-03",3.6,"On tap at Milltown. Smells roasty, with some nutty notes and a good bit of complex fruits, though ultimately leaning toward the traditional caramel/toffee/molasses notes one would expect from the style.  Nice malt profile overall, though.  A bit earthy.  Tasty.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"

Brune bourgogne foncée, peu de collet. arome de blé malté torrifié, quelques notes dépices. Goût de blé chocolaté, bien malté avec des notes dpéices, finission crèmeuse. très bon, merci au serveur pour la recomandation!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
2482,"2009-06-24",3.6,"On tap at The Brick Store. Deep brown with amber highlights, thin tannish head. Sweet aroma of roasted malts, dark fruit, molasses, caramel, chocolate, and light spices. Given the sweetness of the aroma, surprised that the most predominate flavor up front was a pronounced smokiness, which wasnt really present in the nose. Flavor also big on roasted malts, and a coffee like bitterness, chocolate, and dark fruit. Lingering bitterness adds some balance and depth, good smooth texture. Good beer, but the unexpected smokiness kept it from being exceptional in my book.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","AtlAggie"
