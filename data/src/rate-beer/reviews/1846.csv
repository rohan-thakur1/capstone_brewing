Lots of vanilla and whisky that complement each other almost perfectly. Some oak in the smell as well. Taste is very heavy whisky, but the vanilla mellows it out to a nice balance.

1846,"2013-06-09",3.8,"Brewed March 2012; Sampled June 2013
A vigorous pour into my teku glass produces a one-finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a lightish amber color (like a light honey) and shows a lightly hazed, light amber hue when held up to the light. The nose smells of rich, almost butter, concentrated pale malt, vanillin notes, and a sweet, though complex, pale malt grain character. The malt and barrel character combine to produce an almost fruitiness that sort of reminds me of rum soaked golden raisins, though without the alcoholic warmth. There is a very soft, sort of nutty, toasted oak character here, and perhaps just a hint of spice character.

Somewhat sweet, richly textured and malt through the middle, and the finish just sees a dense, chewy, incredibly mellow and smooth  Bourbon Barrel character settle into the palate with a decadent, vanilla soaked sweetened coconut flavor. The sweet malt and barrel character again combine to suggest at an almost fruit character; I can best describe it as golden raisin with a touch of orange marmalade, but that is a bad description. Sweet pale malt provides a sort of sweet, not quite caramelized, grain cracker like note, as well as a chewy bread like sweetness. There is a hint of herbal character here, I am not sure if it is residual hop notes, or just a suggestion from the barrel character, and the bitterness is here, but definitely on the light side to allow the malt character to dominate here.

I really like how smooth the barrel character is here; it is so well integrated and manages to not pick up the heat and harsh character that many a barrel aged beer do; in fact, this is one of the smoother barrel aged beers that I have ever had. A surprisingly good beer that I was not expecting at all; really quite nice and I have to thank DovaliHops for sending me this one.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1846,"2013-02-08",2.8,"Thanks to ILOVESTOUTS for this one.  Served in a cervoise.  Nose is bourbon soaked bread with a bit of oak. Flavor is bourbon heavy with some oak, vanilla, toffee, and a bit of malty sweetness.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
1846,"2013-01-15",4.1,"22 oz bomber into a tulip glass. Huge thanks to ILOVESTOUTS. 

A - Pours a slightly hazy dark orange/amber body. Two fingers of bone white foam settle into a thin cap with some patchy lacing. Decent retention.

S - If I didnt know any better Id say this was a tamer Backwoods Bastard. Nose starts off initially with rich toffee malts followed by a wave of smooth bourbon notes. Butterscotch, vanilla, oak, and warming alcohol. Finishes sweet and fruity with a touch of spice, almost like apples or calvados. Really great aroma.

T - Smooth toffee malt leads right into the bourbon notes. Very strong on the butterscotch and vanilla with some light spice and fruit. The alcohol tends to overwhelm things and muddle the aftertaste.

M - Medium to light bodied with a somewhat high carbonation. Drinkability remains quite high.

O - Not very ""bock like"" to be honest. It is pretty damn tasty with a wonderfully smooth and balanced bourbon presence. Very close to scotch ale territory in terms of flavors and aromas though. I quite enjoyed this one.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

1846,"2012-01-08",3.9,"Tap at brewery.  Pours a clear yellow with a quickly fading white head.  Aroma is big, round bourbon with coconut and vanilla.  Taste has a big, delicious bourbon character up front before a fairly neutral lightly sweet malt backbone and a bit of a grainy or perhaps chalky finish.  Mouthfeel is clean and appropriate for the ABV.  I really enjoy bourbon barrel aged beers where the base beer if fairly nondescript because the bourbon character presents so well.

Medium-full body; moderate carbonation; following the aroma, plenty of soft bourbon character here: a restrained spirit character, warming alcohol, plenty of oak and vanilla notes, and (again) that light vegetal note that could just as easily be coming from bright, new oak character; lots of barrel, and at least not hard; but all barrel, and very little showing from the base beer.
