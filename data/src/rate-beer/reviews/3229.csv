3229,"2017-04-10",2.3,"Pours a clear and thin looking pale yellow with a thin white head. The aroma is faint, with minor amounts of grassy hops, grain, and yeast. The taste is slightly bitter. It isnt as subtle as the nose. Much more grass come through here, as well as bread, honey, and corn. The downside to this is there is a fairly heavy metallic flavor found in here. That metallic flavor dominates the aftertaste. Light in body, slick in texture, and average in carbonation. My mediocre grade to this one actually might be generous.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
