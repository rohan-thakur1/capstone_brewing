843,"2017-06-20",3.2,"Pour is a bright and hazy yellow with a large white head. Aroma is a real nice bready and grain with some lemony hops. Flavor is a decent chewy pils malt with a decent citrus hop. Some white pepper and bitterness in the finish. This was pretty good, the aroma is more in line with a pils and the flavor is more of a hoppy lager. I would get this again.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
843,"2017-06-18",3.4,"Bottle. Nose lightly sweet, big citrus, touch grainy. Pour bright yellow-golden with a just a touch of haze, large frothy white head. Taste grainy, medium-sweet, low bitterness, big hop cit, nice and Saazy, moderately-smooth full body but not fat, light chalk feel throughout, surprisingly only a hint of bread in the finish. Very smooth, just a hint of vanilla and meringue, more lemon, nothing truly overbold, alcohol well-concealed! Hard to recommend this beyond everything being in its right place.

843,"2017-06-12",2.7,"12oz bottle pours a clear pale golden with a huge off white head. Faint aroma of sweet bready caramel malt and light yeast. Sweet malt taste, light lager yeast and faint hop presence, with a big alcohol presence. Boring and bland.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"

Moderately dry and earthy sweetness in the taste. A bit floral. Lighter in body, high carbonation, prickly mouthfeel.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

843,"2017-05-21",4.2,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 1/25/2017. Pours slightly hazy pale golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with insane retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts the whole glass. Thick foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Incredible appearance! Aromas of big lemon, cracker, biscuit dough, lightly toasted bread, herbal, pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of pale malt and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, cracker, biscuit dough, lightly toasted bread, herbal, pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate herbal/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit dough, lightly toasted bread, herbal, pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness and carbonation, increasing through the glass. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 7.5%. Overall this is a fantastic imperial pilsner style! All around awesome robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink for the ABV. Absolutely wonderful example of the style, perfectly balanced. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
843,"2017-05-15",3.4,"Draft served in a nonic pint glass for $3 plus tip. Appears a rich gold, thin off-white head, and body showcases fizz. Aroma consists of wet grain and green grass. It is also has a grassy taste, with a health food store herbalness (I want to say milk thistle, but doubt that is accurate)too mixed in. It is chewy and boozy for a pilsner, so yes it is an imperial pilsner (craft beer speak for what would be called malt liquor). Overall, it is pretty good, probably wont have again, nor can think of an ideal situation for this beer.","","balloonbuffoon"

Aroma is lemon and a bit of honey and bread. Nice.
Taste has a strong malt layer with moderate pine resin bitterness. 
Texture is a little more robust.
Enjoyable.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
843,"2017-05-07",3.4,"On tap at the 2017 Microfest. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a full retentive white head. Aroma is lemon and grass. Taste is sweet pale malt, fresh white bread and an earthy character. Hop taste is good; not overly bitter and with a grassy character. ABV shows up only as a bit of warmth after the swallow. Quite good.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
843,"2017-05-05",3.8,"Press clear yellow with white head. It has a full body with soft carbonation. It has rich bready malt and spicy hops. Much bigger than a pils, but nice.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

843,"2017-04-25",3.0,"Pours a hazy light golden yellow with a big white head of foam with good retention. Aroma is like a biscuit with honey with a hint of rose water. Taste is slightly sweet like honey and also doughy, with some moderate floral and spicy character in the finish. Alcohol is detectable but light. Mouthfeel is mostly crisp with a medium body and high carbonation. Not a fan of these imperial pilsners. I think I would much prefer this as a straight forward Pilsner at an appropriate ABV.","Missouri, USA","jeremyh70"
843,"2017-04-25",3.7,"5 oz draft sample at the Boulevard Tours and Recreation Beer Hall in Kansas City, Missouri. The pour is a clear golden with a white head. The aroma is cracker malt along with clean and fresh grass hops. The taste is doughy malt, clean and fresh floral, herbal, grassy slight spice bitterness to clean dry finish. The palate is medium to light bodied with active carbonation and the dry crisp slight bitter finish.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
843,"2017-04-22",3.5,"Bottle. Pours a golden color with white head. Grainy, corn, straw, earthy aromas. Grainy, earthy, slight syrupy, slight boozy flavors.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jcnielsen"
843,"2017-04-22",3.1,"Bright yellow to light gold color. Smaller, but stable, white head. Fairly subdued aromas. Some pale malts and noble hops. The hops are more dry herbal than floral, which leaves an impression of lack of crispness/freshness. Sweet start, and the floral hops join into to add the sweetness. Hint of alcohol weave their way about. Full feel. Needs a bit more crispness and a full noble hops profile. At least it isnt resembling a malt liquor.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
843,"2017-04-21",3.9,"Aromas mainly malt, some grass, grain and freshness. Flavors like nose, sweet up front, bitter finish. Good body and finish.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
843,"2017-04-20",2.4,"Crisp is the first word that came to mind when I had this. A bit citrusy, not in a sweet way but more of a sour(?) aftertaste. Its OK as a occasional beer but overall its just...meh.","Rapid City, South Dakota, USA","SODAK14"
843,"2017-04-15",3.9,"Aroma is light citrus, grainy malts and German hops. The flavor is grainy/German malts, light citrus/fruit and a smooth/slightly bitter finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"

843,"2017-04-09",2.6,"355ml bottle. This is a well-made lager, but time and time again, I dont know how many times we actually have to go over this but imperializing a pilsner is a STUPID IDEA. This is way too sweet, its not easy to drink, and it is all in all useless.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
843,"2017-04-08",3.7,"Clear light golden hue with a foamy sticky large white head giving a nice bready golden Germanic malty nose with Pilsen grains and a light that bit of crackery tones and a light little bit of grassy hops. Brisk dry and bready grainy and slightly doughy lagery flavor with a cool Germanic noble fresh grassy hop. Plain but well made pilsner with a little more oomph than normal.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
843,"2017-04-06",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2017 Tap. Moderate grain for the malt, light to moderate herbs for the hops, faint dough for the yeast, with damp wood, paper and a hint of grappa in the background. Head is small, wispy, white, with no lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is clear gold. Flavor starts lightly sweet and faintly acidic, then finishes lightly to moderately sweet and moderately bitter. Palate is medium, slick with a soft carbonation and a lightly alcoholic finish. Very easy drinking Imperial Pils, and as previously mentioned, hides its alcohol well.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
843,"2017-04-06",3.1,"Pint at the Winking Lizards Pennisula. Lace on glass. Thin white head. Straw in color. Sweet at first taste. A little malty and carbonated. Little bit of an after bite. Alcohol hidden well for a 7.5. Pretty nice beer.","Stow, Ohio, USA","unclefrito62"
