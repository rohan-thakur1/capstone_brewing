1989,"2011-08-12",4.0,"32 ounce growler

A little trade resulted in receiving a 32 ounce growler of this wonderful release. I really was not sure what to expect but given Cigar Citys track record it couldnt be that bad. After all even when they release experiments they seem to be relatively close to style.

Aroma and appearance - The light brown body poured nearly transparently. This made me wonder if the growler was past its prime. The clean hops, oatmeal, and raisins made it evident this was not the case. Completing the breakfast feel was straight black coffee.

Flavor and palate - Malt and black coffee leave an impression of bitterness on the tongue. Soon chased away by raisins, oatmeal, and a scoop of sugar the finish turns into a sweet dessert experience. Carbonation adds depth and reaffirms this was still as fresh as when it was originally filled. I cant wait for the next time I get to try one of their beers.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The aroma is strong with oatmeal, cinnamon and red wine. The flavor does in fact elicit the memory of oatmeal raisin cookies, but with some additional sourness thrown-in. The palate is medium and and carbonation is lively. Finishes long and slightly sour.

Further up there are raisins, cola, nuts (brazil, kola), oatmeal, metal and chocolate. A bit of baked bread. Earthy, a bit dirty. Flavors are metallic, raisins, vanilla, earth and nuts. Husky, tobacco. Super nutty. Sadly I am not seeing the big cookie flavors that the beer promises. Not even a little bit. More like a vinous brown ale, with a touch of cinnamon. A bit too attenuated/dry to capture the essence of any cookie.  Not a bad beer by any means, but I guess I had my hopes up a bit too much. Some oatmeal and raisins in the after taste. Lively bubbles, dry and kind of thin. Still metallic on the finish.  To be honest, it seems like it could be the start of an infection (possibly).

Medium body; medium carbonation. Such a perfect presentation here: creamy, just sweet enough, very mild acidity, with a milky subtexture (new word); cinnamon, brown sugar, and a moderate malty toastiness, along with some undertones of darker fruits and, again, light milkiness; mild roasted maltiness present as well; very nicely approximates an oatmeal raisin cookie served with a glass of milk (Cookie Crunch came to mind as well... but this doesnt have a cloying sugariness); just a neat, tasty, beautifully packaged beer.

Smell: Smells a lot like fresh baked oatmeal raisin cookies. Typical brown ale aroma paired with cinnamon and raisins.

Taste: Up front is a blast of what tastes like an oatmeal raisin cookie. Cinnamon and raisins are obvious flavors throughout. There is a bit of hoppy bitterness near the finish to go along with toasted malt. Aftertaste is a nice mixture of cinnamon, hops and malt. Very well-balanced.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.

Drinkability: Very high drinkability. You could knock back a few of these without any trouble.

Poured a mahogany hue with a small fizzy head and spotty lace, the growler had leaked but the carbonation is just fine. The aroma is much as the name indicates, you get a raisin (and sugar covered plum) fruitiness that reminds me a bit of the Abbey Ales along with a toasted oatmeal cookie vapour. A hint of Cavendish pipe tobacco and alcohol phenols as well. The taste is more towards the roasted kilned malts upfront with a definite fruity supporting cast. Some of that sugary spice and cinnamom bun tones found on the nose along with some of the tobacco character and a touch of butterscotch . Long aftertaste of over-ripened dark fruits. Earthy and twangy with a slight medicinal finish. The mouth feel is smooth and a bit oily, soft finish with a bit of alcohol warming. The body is actually a bit thinner than I would have hoped to better match the flavor profile. Overall it is a neat treat that takes the standard brown ale up a notch (almost more akin to a Strong Ale but anyway)... with a hybrid characteristics that you get with the raisin and plummy tones. That said I am not sure this is something I would really want to drink much of as the light spice does interfere a bit with my overall enjoyment.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Theres no mistaking the oatmeal cookies in the flavor though.  Cookies mix with toasty caramel, bakers chocolate, nuts, and some hops round it out.

Another nice brew from these guys.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
1989,"2009-10-22",3.8,"The straightforward oatmeal raisin cookie aroma is met with subtle roasted flavors, oats, malts and company. Not as sweet as one might expect.  A pleasing spin on the Maduro.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Odde"
1989,"2009-10-22",3.9,"Seriously! This is a cookie in a bottle. Brown color with plum highlights. Aroma has oats, molasses, raisins, sugar, caramel and cookies. Flavor is like cake, gentle spice, raisins, oats, cream, nuts and toffee. I think CC nailed this one, tastes like an oatmeal raisin cookie.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
1989,"2009-10-21",3.7,"growler thanks to Todd.  Caramel on the nose with hints of ginger and raisons.  As it warms more of the ""cookie"" aromas seem to appear, very nice.  Pours brown with a thin off white head.  Ginger and allspice, caramel and raisons, toasted oats, brown sugar, man it really tastes like an oatmeal cookie, especially as it warms slightly.  Although it seems to be a little thin on the palate.  But overall and excellent treatment to a great beer!","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
1989,"2009-10-20",3.6,"Growler, courtesy cmillward.  Pours a hazy, dark, caramel-chestnut brown hue that glows slightly reddish in the light.  A small, frothy, off-white head settles in to a bubbly film, leaving behind minimal, scattered spots of lacing.  They nailed the aroma, as it really does smell very much like an oatmeal raisin cookie.  Notes of toasted cookie dough join the base caramel and cocoa, while oats smooth things out even further and hints of raisin lend a fruity earthiness. Flavors show the same base elements, but seem far less defined, a bit more muddled.  Caramel and vanilla emerge, while hints of soft cocoa roast balance things out a little.  Medium bodied and smooth, it drinks so easily.  Good stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1989,"2009-10-19",3.5,"Tasted at Otown Throwdown. Hazy brown pour. Huge oatmeal, raisin and sweet cookie malt aroma. Aroma lives up to the name. Chocolate roasted grain, raisin in the taste. Taste cant keep up with the aroma, good brew nonetheless.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1989,"2009-10-18",3.8,"dark amber with an off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of caramel malts, nuts, oats, toast, roast, and espresso.  Taste of caramel malts, nuts, raisins, oatmeal, and roast, with a dry finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1989,"2009-10-03",4.0,"Draft.  Poured a dark brown amber with a thin beige head.  Nose is oatmeal cookies.  I agree with TampaBrew that the flavor is even more spot on oatmeal cookie than the aroma.  Very interseting, I actually loved this Maduro treatment.  On a cool fall night I could drink a gallon of this.  Great job Doug!","Tampa, Florida, USA","HOPSHUNTER"
1989,"2009-10-03",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2011 On tap at the Brass Tap. Pours a opaque brown. Nose is an Oatmeal cookie! Cinnamon, raisin, plum, roasted grains, toasty malt, oatmeal. Flavor is even more cookie-ish. Perfect balance of cinnamon and spices with sweet raisins and oats. This is one of my favorite treatments of Maduro. Made me want to start a fire, sit back with an actually oatmeal cookie and enjoy the chilly Florida 70 degree winter nights. I loved this!","Alaska, USA","gkost"
1989,"2009-10-03",3.9,"On tap at Brass Tap.  Pours dark brown with an off-white head.  Nose is oatmeal, raisin, sugar, cinnamon, brown sugar, tobacco, and vanilla.  FL is similar with lots of sugar, vanilla, and tobacco.  Excellent Brown ale and great sweetness.  Medium bodied and excellent for Maduro- the cookie part of it cushions the tobacco-esque bitterness of the Maduro.  A perfect starter beer.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
1989,"2009-10-01",3.8,"On tap at Brass Tap (Tampa, FL). Pours a amber cola brown with one finger off-white head with good retention. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel, vanilla, fresh raisins --just like an oatmeal cookie. Flavor is sweet and malty as well with similar notes of vanilla, raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon, malty sweetness. Generally medium body with a sweet, malty lightly spicy finish. Very tasty -- if you like oatmeal cookies.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
1989,"2009-10-01",3.7,"Big cheers to Doug for putting this one together for the brass tap event. 

A: Pours an amberish brown, more red than brown which is somewhat suprising as regular maduro pours pretty brown. Nice tall head that shows good retention and leggy lace. 

S: Wonder aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, and cinnamon. 

T: The nice malty nutty maduro is there right from the start. Real vanilla and cinnamon push through in the middle. A raisin sweetness can be picked up in the finish along with more cinnamon. 

M: On the lighter side of medium. Smooth drinking beer. 

D: Not the most drinkable due to the sweetness. One tasty treat though that I hope to see again.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
1989,"2009-10-01",3.5,"On tap at The Brass Tap. It pours amber with tan head and lasting tan spider web lacing. The aroma carries some malts, a bit of roast, vanilla spice, cinnamon, raisin and a touch of nuttiness. The taste starts neutral for a moment or two and then moves into malts and nuttiness. By midway raisins, vanilla and some spicy cinnamon surface and push this toward the finish with the vanilla and cinnamon spice growing right into the after taste.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
