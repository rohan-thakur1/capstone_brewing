2320,"2014-05-06",3.3,"On tap at 5 Seasons Westside. Pours a muddy brown with a medium, cream colored head. The aroma is milk chocolate, coffee, some light earthiness, and cashews. Mellow sweetness, with a lightly sour and bitter aftertaste. Medium to heavy body, smooth, and creamy. Overall, this is a milkshake of a beer, but it lacks the yeast character and complexity that I wouldve expected. Not bad, but just... alright.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

When I took this cork off, I was taken back by the fruityness of this beer.  Nice looking deep rich amber brown color.  Flavor is nice, very fruity, with a hint of oak and brown sugar.  Could use a tad bit carbonation, but im sure this is not an issue on tap.

This sports a very rich nose with loads of dark, ripe fruit, rum oak, and a subtle spiced backdrop. The mouthfeel is still, sticky, and oily. Wow, this is a huge Belgian styled beer. Tons of sweet vinous character in the flavor with hints of vanilla, tobacco, fruit bouquet, figs, cashews, and chocolate. I didnt find any aggressive esters here, just enough to keep things complex. I really enjoy the fact that 5 Seasons has made an enormous, robust Belgian styled ale without any cloying sweetness or spices.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

2320,"2007-08-13",3.7,"From a 12oz bottle.  Generously shared by cquiroga 5/2007.  Pours a very dark, mostly transparent color with a thin layer of cream tan head.  Some husky, woody aromas in the nose, along with some dry chocolates and a hint of raisin.  A bit of solventy alcohol heat noticeable, but not overpowering.  Sticky fudge nougat and a touch of vanilla round out the bouquet.  Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel.  Some nice coconut flavors accompany loads of raisins, prunes, and dry leathery tannins.  Nice and fruity, but dusty woody esters balance these characters up front.  More of the sweet, chocolaty, fruity malts build toward the end, resulting in a moderately sweet finish.  Id like to see a bit of the dryer, woody, spicy yeast phenols dry up the finish a bit more, but its still good nonetheless.  Thanks for sharing, Chris!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Flavor is a crescendo of new flavors and complexity. Starts in roasted caramel and praline, backed by light Old-ale ox, then climbs up into middle fruits of prunes, reduced plums and fig jam, dappled with brandy. Third level finds warming husky special B and mellowing rock candy. Some call this rather sweet, which is probably true, but for a beer of such intensity and magnitude, I actually think its palate is nicely balanced and able to gradually reveal intricate characters over time.

I taste a bunch of things in there and its hard to pinpoint it but here I go. I get some raisins, chocolate, figs, fresh coffee, caramel, some peaches if you pay attention.

2320,"2005-10-07",4.1,"This is a very interesting brew indeed.
When you get a beer that defies a straightforward description, it must be a Belgian!
Poured in a snifter, this dark brown brew gave up dark fruity notes of a Trappist along with sweet chocolate notes that suggested a strong brown ale or an Imperial Porter with little roastiness.
Increasingly aromatic as it warmed and warming as well to the drinker. Very well done and a creatively done one as well. This one needs to be bottled and put in the cellar, I think it would do quite well over time.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

Flavor has elements of licorice, chocolate, and a wee bit of brandy. Alcohol hidden extremly well. Very good strong ale and worth the wait.

Had a dark chocolate bitterness thing going, a slight rubber glove powder bitterness thing going. Its like it swayed between an impy stout and a double at times. Definetely could sense some alcohol in the finish. Most interesting, possible a new style.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
2320,"2005-10-04",3.9,"Deep mahogany-ruby hue with a large, frothy, tan head thats well lasting.  Unadulterated rich hue.  The first whiff reveals spicy cocoa.  Rich bakers chocolate intertwined with note of lemon zest and nutmeg.  The spices are light, but the overall feeling is one of contrast, not clash.  Further along, but no less powerful is the aroma of roasted chestnuts and cashews followed by a subtle hint of ginger.  Distinct floral and herbal hop notes with the latter tending towards woody qualities.  Moderate (if that) clove and banana yeast notes.  A touch of alcohol in the vein of a sweet smelling scotch.  As it warms additional notes of rye bread, plums, cantaloupe, and mango show through.  Certainly pleasing and intriguing but a bit muddled to work through.  Perhaps like an odd combination of Malheur Dark Brut and Ellezelloise Hercule Stout.  Moreover, like a combination of an imperial stout and an imperial brown brewed with Belgian yeast and a dash of spices.  Many of the aroma subtleties are instantly lost on my palate and theres a definite woody quality to the finish.  Very sweet throughout with a lightly bitter finish and surprisingly low acidity.  The elements I typically associate with high gravity/candi-sugar laden Belgians seems to be missing.  Those phenols just arent there in force and its a bit on the thick feeling side of things.  Full bodied, creamy/velvety texture, moderate carbonation.  The beer was served from a pitcher, seemingly due to massive over-carbonation from the tap.  Its a very nice mouthfeel, though it could stand to be broken up by that additional carbonation.  Surprisingly no real alcohol taste, good or bad, though Im horrible at discerning that element.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
2320,"2005-10-04",4.0,"Long wait for this beer. This is is a dark brown body with a tan, creamy, stiff head that lasts for a while. Heavily malty aroma is backed up by a bit of raisin fruitiness. The flavor is sweet with brown sugar, molasses making up the malt. Theres the raisins again, but theres a bit of banana and pineapple way in the back. The sweetness covers up most of the alcohol except for a warmth in the swallow that lets you know its stronger than it seems at first taste. Good beer. Really more of an imperial brown than a Belgian strong though. A bit of the Belgian ale yeast funkiness, but not enough to really scream ""Belgian-style"".","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
