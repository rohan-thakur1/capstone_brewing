From notes. Enjoyed at Corbet¬ís house warming on April 23. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a lighter pink color with a thin white head that vanishes quickly without a whole lot of lace left behind. The aroma is great. There is a huge fruitiness with a solid tartness and a strong dose of lactic acid. The raspberry, passion fruit, a light saltiness, and a hint of lemon citrus. This is rather complex and enjoyable. It¬ís not quite like the 3 Little Birds, but this is good. The flavor is much of the same. Raspberry, passion fruit, lemon citrus, a light saltiness, this is almost like a sorbet with some of the lactic acid. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly beautiful tart fruitiness. Damn. I like this one a lot.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3544,"2017-04-23",4.0,"Starting off the fest right with a quick visit with Jonathan. This is such a great festival.
Poured up at Ratebeer Best 2017 Beer Fest where it exhibits a murky deep purple to blood orange colored body that supports a thin white head. The aroma offers up funky passion fruitiness, some tart notes and then a salt sensation around the edges. The taste is tart and puckering but not too much where there¬ís also a nice bright berry like and tropical fruitiness. From there is slowly moves into a soft modestly salty finish.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Pours cloudy pinkish peach, small off-white head, pinkish as well that dissipates fairly slowly with good lacing. Aroma is loaded with guava, lactose, and sea salt. Oddly, I notice that guava is the one tropical fruit NOT included in the ingredients list. What the hell do I know? You dumbasses really should not be wasting your time reading my shitty reviews. Flavor is light tart, lactic, loads of sea air notes, tropical fruit and an underpinning of funk. Light plus body, soft carbonation creamy.
