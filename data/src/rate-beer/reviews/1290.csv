1290,"2012-04-15",3.0,"[Cask at the Duck & Pond, Harrow] Pours amber-red with a thick creamy head.  Rich fruity aroma (plums) is rather let down by the taste - the orange up front is nice, but then theres a lot of standard GK toffee malt, with a dusty, suplhurous finsh.  On the sweet side.  Couldnt quite understand the high ratings on this one - seemed like juat another boring GK bitter to me?","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

1290,"2007-12-13",3.3,"Cask @ The Bear, Camberwell. Nice deep red / mahogany colour head disappearing quickly. Aroma is fruity / liquorice. Taste is dark fruits / some spice with a full body. Finish is slightly bitter and dry. Enjoyable!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Carlus12"
1290,"2007-05-01",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2007 Pint at The sad Hog Tavern. A heady waft of oily hop. A touch of ganja. Transparent raspberry red. A puckering blast of grapefruit bitterness. Crisply refreshing but a little thin-bodied for the ABV. Tasty but one-dimensional. (Re-rate) Back at SHT. Sweaty hop and long doughy biscuit. Intense malt-hop balance. Very nice.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
1290,"2006-12-24",3.3,"Cask.  Orange gold in colour, this has a malty, spicy aroma.  Flavours consist of toffee with some fruit and spice.  The finish is chalky and dry but not bitter.  I was expecting more from this beer.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
1290,"2006-11-02",3.6,"A Mes rate: Cask at Baker Street JDW. Mmm I enjoyed this. Straight forward in the aroma but lovely and fruity in the mouth. A little candy sugar but generally creamy malts are the dominant force. Nice thick mouthfeel. Full bodied and rich. Better than I expected.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1290,"2006-10-12",3.2,"Half on cask. Perfect temperature. Mahogany red-tinged. Thin foamy head diminishing to nothing. Dark malty aroma combined with fruity notes. Flavour contains dark fruit and dark berries. Bitter sweetness towards the end. Dry finish. Flat and medium mouthfeel (The Harp in Covent Garden 18.09.2006).","Tromsø, NORWAY","Rune"
1290,"2006-10-09",3.3,"Cask at The Harp London WC2 16 Sep 06. Chestnut brown coloured.  A small off-white head. Fruity aroma. A caramellish rich flavour. A long bitter aftertaste. Well balanced.","Tromsø, NORWAY","Finn"
1290,"2006-09-27",3.3,"Cask at Ipswich Beer festival. Clean copper with a frothy head. Licorice aroma. Flavours are fruity and bitter reminding me of old English plum pudding. Complex, fruity ale.","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"

1290,"2005-11-28",3.7,"Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Dark reddish brown with malty head. Thick on palate, dark roasted fruity beer, didnt taste like old ale though, more a fruity sweet malty beer. Warming alcohol kick, very moorish. Enjoyable.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
1290,"2005-11-22",2.9,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2006 Not bad, a little creamy as well. Good colour and shape. Good head, a little strong, but not bitter sweet as other strong ales. Not tiring and good flavor.","Xalapa, MEXICO","Nekronos"
1290,"2005-10-13",4.0,"Red amber beer with a creamy off-white head. Aroma of malt and berries. Sweet flavour with lots of berries, but balanced by plenty of hops and a lasting bitterness. Very smooth and rich.","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"
1290,"2005-08-27",4.5,"A wonderful beer that flies in the face of brewers contention that drinkers only want a 4.4% amber bitter. This was developed as a special one off bottled beer in honour of Ridleys head brewer, but proved so popular that it became a bottled regular, then an occasional cask version was released. It is now a cask regular and is becoming available in a wider and wider range of pubs. Its a dark malty brew redolent with sweet ripe fruit and dripping with brown syrup. It takes the mouth a moment to adjust to the high percentage of crystal malt, but when it does the drinker is seduced. The beer never has a chance to become too sweet or cloying because the dark spicy hops are always present, providing a sublime and intoxicating balance and a long, dreamingly earthy finish. The style is not quite an Old Ale but is more of a Dark Premium Bitter, like a cross between Old Peculier and Fullers ESB.","ENGLAND","Scarborough"
1290,"2005-03-31",3.4,"Cask: Mahogny coloured. Quite malty body. Slightly burnt, bitter finish. Some hints of fruit in the aroma.","Copenhagen K, DENMARK","Mads Langtved"
1290,"2005-03-28",3.5,"Strong flavoured malty ale, fairly swet with hints of fruit, spices and alcohol. Good beer although not great.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","kwik-lime"
1290,"2005-03-22",2.5,"Cask @ Akkurat, StockholmMahogany with speckled head. Initially some pears in the aroma and taste. Quite sweet. Some roasted character. Sultana aftertaste.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","MrWalker"
1290,"2005-03-14",3.7,"Cask conditioned. Deep amber coloured. Very fruity and malty aroma. Fruity and malty flavour with a hoppy bitterness in the finish. Complex and full flavoured.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"
1290,"2005-03-14",3.7,"Cask ConditionedClean amber to dark-amber color. The aroma is quite simple, but the flavor is really interesting: malty,smoth, some sweetness, some caramel and a really pleasant hop touch. A great pleasure.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
1290,"2005-03-09",4.0,"Cask @ The Wharf, Aalborg, DK. Copper/amber colour with an off-white head. Intense sweetish/fruity/hoppy aroma which reminded me of apples. For some reason, I really like that in a beer. Flavour is sweet and has the same apple character as in the aroma (but it works better in the aroma). Also has an alcohol character which I find clashes a bit. Could use some more bitterness in the finish.","Frederikssund, DENMARK","NosirIwont"
1290,"2005-03-08",3.8,"Cask conditioned @ The Crispin, Wokingham.  Orange and sweet dark malts. A tasty full bodied beer with lasting and eminently drinkable finish.","Southampton, Hampshire, ENGLAND","Mungo"
1290,"2005-03-04",4.4,"This is a gorgeous beer in the cask. There is an interesting sulpher and fresh yeast nose, which doesnt really prepare you for the delights to come. Full bodied with a strong taste of dark oranges, Pontefract Cakes (little flat liquorice sweets) and magnolias, the taste is satisfying, complex and very moreish. The finish starts off with steamed rhubarb, develops into cooked oranges then livens into a little marmalade tang. The finish seems to go on for ever becoming drier and hoppier, lingering like the memory of your first love. This is the dream of what all British bitters should taste like. A masterpiece.  Several more encounters with Old Bob have established this as a classic. Its popularity is increasing so that it is a frequent visitor to Wetherspoon pubs. The next stage will be that Greene King will buy out Ridleys in order to get their hands on the brand. [4.4]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
1290,"2004-11-09",3.8,"Cask at Butchers Arms, North End, Nr. Chelmsford. Dark golden with white head. This was full bodied but not too heavy balanced by the hops. This packs quite punch with the alcohol in evident.
Can be too sweet but this time was in fine form.","Essex, ENGLAND","Hbie"
1290,"2004-09-26",4.4,"Cask, Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough.  Dark amber coloured, with creamy off-white head. This beer had class written all over it as soon as I saw it.  Sweet toffee aroma. Sweet malty, but well balanced flavour. Full bodied, with a desirable mouthfeel.","Loughborough, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","JonMoore"
1290,"2004-08-31",4.7,"Peterborough cask ale festival. Outstanding flavours. Smooth yet fascinating and rewarding. Lots of flavour. Distinctive. Nutty. Roasty. Toffee. Sweet, yet bitter. All of England is here.","Swindon, ENGLAND","WhiteStar"

1290,"2004-02-07",3.5,"Draught at The Rover, Gothenburg, Sweden.

A yeasty citrus-aroma.
Almost flat and a bit harsh with a fine bitterness.","Billdal, SWEDEN","larsniclas"
1290,"2003-11-13",3.4,"On Cask-Somewhere in London. Pours an amber color with a thin white head. Has the malty aroma I love in English ales. Slightly sweet with a light alcohol finish. Good.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"
1290,"2003-09-30",3.4,"Deep amber in colour. Fruity nose. Malty and fruity on the palate, with sweetish candied orange notes to the fore. Rich and full-bodied. Some balancing bitterness, but this only really comes through on the finish, which is lingering. Pretty good stuff, but I agree with a previous taster that the mouthfeel is a little syruppy for extended drinking. Handpump, The Speaker, London SW1, September 2003.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1290,"2003-09-03",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2003 Got this one for the name, it was new at the pub on tap. Not bad, but dry and strong. A bit of spice.","Earth, Pennsylvania, USA","r464"
1290,"2003-07-17",3.2,"Not bad. Palate is sweetish, then bitter. The malts gives the flavour a bit of raisins and toffee, the hops give some acidity and a slight citric edge. Something was slightly syruppy/oily/sticky about the mouthfeel aswell, not necesarily a bad thing, but it didn't really help its cause, nice though. (Cask-ChelmsfordBF 03')","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
1290,"2003-07-16",3.3,"Golden/amber color.  Raisins and fruity flavor, with citrus like a rough-cut marmalade.  It was a warm day so the palate was perhaps lighter than it might have been--it wasn't watery, but still lighter.  This lay between a bitter and a strong ale in a curious way. (gravity pour at 2003 Chelmsford Beer Festival)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1290,"2003-06-11",3.6,"Cask Conditioned, a Masque Haunt, London Good deep amber colour, clear, with a white crusty head. Big bitter hop aroma, sweet malt and chutney flavour. Good bitter finish. The body is so full its almost chewy. Strong beer though, particularly when greedy little mouths are washing down pints of the stuff.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"
1290,"2002-11-27",4.4,"What A delight! After looking around London I finally found a pub with it on. Darker than I had expected. Rich, full, round, tongue coating malty with enough of the right bitterness to do the trick. I was hoping for something decent and pleasantly surprised to find I found just that. Now can I have another?","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
1290,"2002-08-21",4.2,"Sampled cask conditioned at GBBF.
