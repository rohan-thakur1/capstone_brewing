Aroma is very nice with a moderately strong berry aroma, though with and herbal, tannic note similar to berry leaves and skins. Light herbal note. Light oak notes. Berry is light enough to allow the base beer to show through. 
Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a medium sized, white head that recdes steadily. Second pour had some berry sediment. 
Flavor has a medium to medium high berry note. A moderately strong tannic note from the berry skins and seeds with a bit of an herbal, berry leaf note. Medium light oak notes with some light hay and light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. 
Overall, still not my favorite berry lambic as the tannins are a bit strong, but the berry notes are very unique. The lighter cloudberry character does a nice job of integrating with the base lambic.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

4411,"2016-02-11",4.6,"Bottle, Akkurat 20th anniversary batch, shared by James on 2/5/16.First off, a huge thanks to James for very graciously offering to share this with me with nothing in return expected and I will hopefully return the favor at some point.Thank god we had some cloudberry jam before trying this stuff. Not that the aroma wasnt amazing, but I was much more able to appreciate just how magnificent of a job they did in getting the pure, lovely cloudberry aroma and flavor in to the beer, after trying the jam. Nose is wow. Just wow. Jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring. However you want to phrase it. It was a long time before I even felt the need to take a sip of the stuff. Extremely difficult to describe cloudberrys aroma/flavor profile. Definitely some woodiness to it, as James suggested. Perhaps lightly cedary? Theres a dry apricot element and then a very wine-like character as well, almost riesling-like. Intense, hugely aromatic and unwavering, it captures the cloudberry perfectly in the nose and is decidedly much less funky than any other Cantillon Ive ever had. But thats fine, because this is one of the top 3 fruit aromas Ive ever smelled.In the flavor its quite wine-like, with the woodiness prominent, and the big juicy, fleshy, almost gooseberry-mixed-with-apricot-and-sugar character that I seem to associate with cloudberry. Tart, for sure, but less of the extreme funk that Cantillon is known for. Some, like GrumpyTroll, remark ""Wheres the horseblanket?"" and thats a fair critique. But I personally cant take fault with it when the fruit is captured so perfectly here. A truly incredible beer that very much met the years of hype and searching to try it. Hope to have it again some time soon at Akkurat!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

S - mells like tangerine, grapefruit and apricot. Aroma is great but I can tell this will be quite the sour beer. 

T - The taste is really unique. Im not an expert in cloudberry so this is hard to rate. Lots of fruit, citrus and a bit of wine tannins. It does leave a lingering mouth puckering sour after a few sips. Some lemon pucker for sure. 

M - Not an explosive mouthfeel but also no where near flat.

4411,"2014-05-02",4.5,"Truly one of the most special fruited Cantillon Ive had the pleasure of tasting. Batch one 1999, bottle #265, 375ml, shared thanks to Bill at the Denver Ghost Tasting had a bracing acidity and sharp cloudberry-seed sourness to it, almost mealy in taste with a pulpy appearance. Age has definitely taken some of the fruitiness of the more recent fresh batch away, however its nice to see that the cloudberry is able to hold its own with some serious years on it. 
2012 vintage, Magnum, tasted at Akkurat 9/13, Extremely fresh and fruity, bursting with bright acidity and pulpy fruit consistency. Although I got a slight phenolic note, though that didnt detract much. Love that aroma of cloudberry compote and the resinous sediment left in the glass after taking the last sip. Opened a 750 ml later, a bit more honed in/composed, not as much phenol and hardly any indication of taint but still very young and green tasting.

Pours straw to golden color, with a slight  haze. The off-white head begins  one-finger thick, and gradually fades to a thin ring that persists to the last sip. The tart berry aroma is fairly intense and can be picked up from a few feet away. Tart berries take the forefront, and are nicely complimented by lemon, wheat, earth and a firm lactic backbone. The flavor was moderately tart and fairly acidic, with the cloudberries integrating quite nicely with the gueuze.  Lemon, brett, and earthy character compliment the tartness and add depth. The berry character clings to the soft palate for a lengthy finish, and seem to become more pronounced as they linger.

Following, the opaque golden to pale orange pour wears a lasting, finely laced 1cm cover despite its 8 years. Fantastic fresh nose then keeps you on your cloud.Delicate and refined hay flavor (a trait that this particular rater particularly adores), complemented by various fruits, the usual lactic qualities, yogurt-like and a very frank, by Cantillons standards, citrus attack, lemony and orangey all at once. The barnyard soft farminess that forms the landscape is not without a certain crispness despite a minimal corkiness that hints at cellar conditions. Very smooth champaign like carbonation, comfortable... Well, this one meet the equilibrium between dryness, tartness, freshness.. between lactic and citric acidity. All the while, generous grapeyness borders cranberries. Lots of words, but its not the most complex beer, it remains focused and on elegance at that. Vinous.

Ive been looking forward to this one for a while. Comes in a beautifully wrapped 375ml Champagne bottle. Not much pop in the cork was a small worry, but  the beer poured a slightly hazed apricot colour and a small white head rose, and stayed around for only a short while. 
 
Aroma is simply amazing, incomparable to anything Ive smelt before, sure... it has some of the Cantillon house notes that show in all their beers, but the sheer intensity and complexity of fresh cloudberry combined with bretty notes separates it. You could smell it from at least a meter away. Up close, I noted some composting lemons, vanilla, oak, as well as a slightly more intense brett character than most Cantillons Ive tried before. Words do not really describe the depth and complexity the aroma has, all I can do is say wow and give it a 10. The first sip carries a sharp acidity, but rounds out into a smooth fruity tang, the cloudberry is far more subdued than in the aroma and almost tastes more like very ripe apricot. Other flavours are of oak, carsick, vanilla, lime and white grapes. A small step down from the aroma, but to be honest it was always going to struggle to live up to that. Finish is acidic, sharp, dry but fruity. A classic beer I will never forget.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","voota"

Flavours are more fruity with the lemony lambik characterin the lead, though cheese is always there. The mellow character of the cloudberries are only very faint, but what can you expect from a 7 year old bottle of fruit lambik? Still quite lively and definitely dry to the bone.

The Cantillon lambic is drowned out by a rush of tongue rasping acidity and sourness, yes even too much for me!  Bone dry in body with some hints of other flavours such as pineapple, or maybe rhubarb.  I have to be honest and say that I didn't really take to this beer, maybe the fruits and Lambic didn't match with my palate or something.  I don't know, but I was left feeling disappointed.

4411,"2003-10-05",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2004 [The special version - the first bottles made] A hazy orange beer with a fine white head. The aroma is lovelywith strong notes of cloudberries as well as acid and grapefruit. The flavor is lovely too with the sourness drawing the mouthwater - it is quite lactic with lots of cloudberry notes. [The ordinary] Afar this beer has a strong aroma of cloudberries - but sticking your nose in the glass turns the aroma sour, with sweet and sharp notes - like a lambic. The color is a hazy orange and it has a good but collapsing head. The flavor is sharp, sour, and sweet - just like a wild-fermented beer should be. The cloudberries makes up a great background for the above mentioned flavors. A very special beer - but not as good as I had hoped. [8/3/7/3/16]","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Very sour and salty flavour with a tart flavour of cloudberries. Very sour finish. Unique.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","ante"
4411,"2003-08-02",2.4,"Pale orange, hazy colour. Medium head. Big cloudberry aroma. Sweet clouberry- flavour followed by acidic lambic-flavour. I dont think they mix very well or is it just that I never liked cloudberries very much. Yeah, thats probably it.","Finspång, SWEDEN","pilsnerrogge"
4411,"2003-07-26",4.3,"Heavenly golden rays shine through the soft white clouds, I am entranced. . . A sweet smelling breeze comes to my nose and just as I inhale turns sour, stony and leathery.  In my trance I am fed small orbs I have never seen before, their flavour is a mouthwatering, tart funkiness. . . I reach out for more. . . this time there is an initial rush of sweetness only to be followed by more mouth-puckering tartness. . .

4411,"2003-07-07",4.4,"Bottle #52 of 1000, 1999, sampled 7/2003brewed with cloudberries - blond-orange colour, nice creamy head, very deep fruity aroma (orange, blackberry), deeply complex (vinegar, farm and haye), strong and beautiful acidity, fresh, long dry orange and vinegar finish - I'm totally confused by this fantastic experience; this is a beer to respect - Thanks to Per for this one !","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
4411,"2003-07-07",4.0,"Bottle #52, year 1999I'm completely lost! Difficult to evaluate this one… orange color, hazy; very strong nose, acid, fruity; in the beginning nearly smells, then I get used to it, appreciating more and more the fruits. Orange character in the final. Very strange.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
4411,"2003-07-06",4.1,"Typicaly peppery sour cantillon house aroma, with the addition of an indescribable (for me) fruity essence.  Flavor is sour with the earthy remnants of a fruit flavor.  Complex and very interesting.  I need to track down some cloudberry jam, so I can begin to get my head around this beer.  A beer I'd always wanted to taste, and I assumed I'd never get the chance with out actually going to Stockholm.  Thanks for the treat!","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
4411,"2003-07-05",4.6,"This is a wonderful lambic - with a wispy, clean fruit aroma and a really sour initial flavor(cloudberries?), Soleil de Minuit finishes quite differently from where it begins - it leaves one with a certain sweetness.  Complex and lovely.","Albion, Michigan, USA","hoppygrrrl"

4411,"2003-07-04",3.9,"Summer Gathering 2003: Fascinating, very different stuff. Sweet nose, hints of currants or blueberries. A certain funkiness--olives or pimientos going on in there. Cloudy yellow. Intensely sour, salty, funky, touch of olives, blueberries, and gin. Very dry and lip-smackingly tart.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
4411,"2003-07-02",3.9,"Cloudy yellow/gold w/ little head. Musty, tart but sweet brine aroma w/ some horse blanket & leather notes. I assume the fruitiness is Cloudberry, but I've never had cloudberries. Light, dry, acidic feel. Very sour, salty, briny flavour combines with an almost lemony fruitiness.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
4411,"2003-07-02",3.9,"Thanks to Oakes for this pleasure.  Very odd, but intriguing nose. Sort of like a pimento olive in a very dry martini.  Sweet and sour tasting, often dry and elusive.  We all spent a lot of time with this sample and I, for one, am going on a cloudberry search at Ikea very soon.  Refreshing and slightly complex, excellent fruit flavor for a fruit I have yet to try on it's own.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
4411,"2003-06-30",4.6,"RBSG2003. The single most sweet and tart simultaneity I have ever experience, bar none. Delicious. Salt and leather are there among the cloudberry (?) sweetness (I have to get me some of those!). Thanks Josh!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
4411,"2003-06-29",4.3,"Hazy apricot orange with a nice, but not outrageous, head.  The aroma was one of the most unique experiences of my life, likely due to the cloudberry, with which I have no experience before this.  Both tart and sweet at the same time.  A nice tart fruitiness is present, not unlike, but better than, the FouFoune.  Acidic and tart throughout.  The fruit usually helps cut the bite, but I think it may have only enhanced it here.  This was a very lucky opportunity for me, and I owe many thanks to Oakes for allowing me to sample this.  A tremendous offering from Cantillon.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
4411,"2003-02-25",4.5,"Colour: hazy orange; thick wild head, nearly immediately gone. Nose consists of a lesser fruitexplosion. I suppose it are cloudberries, but it makes me think of pineapple, or very sweet rosy grapefruit. Horseblanket is there as well, as well as something like VERY fresh, living seafood.
Taste comes with the Cantillon acid-bite, surrounding an astounding fruity taste. Rosy grapefruit comes to mind again. The fruityness definitely mellows the acidity. My wife, however speaks about decaying and oxydizing vegetable matter...
There is some throat-burn, so quite some acids. Refreshing, too. No new aftertaste, just the aromas of the fruit, esters and fruitacids lingering on. A rare one, this, to be consumed with moderation and reverence.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
4411,"2002-06-16",4.0,"Sampled bottle (no.373) was stored for two years. It´s golden and cloudy with huge aroma of cloudberries with a sourish tone and a hint of mineur. The flavor is sourish with a cloudberry tone and lots of cloudberries in the finish. A beer that´s just keeps getting better and better.

4411,"2001-08-24",4.7,"This is a breakthrough in brewery (almost..). Combining swedish cloudberries with Belgian beerbrewing is genious! This lambic was produced by the swedish pub Akkurat (norwegian for correct), Jamtlands Brewery in Sweden (correct me if Im wrong) and Brasserie Cantillon in Belgium. What Ive heard (Im a regular at Akkurat in Stockholm) is that some swedish guys sent 300 kilos of cloudberries down to Cantillon and got back around 3000 bottles. They sell this rare lambic at Akkurat for 105 SEK (around $10 USD) and its damn worth the money! I have had atleast 10 bottles of this sour, yellowish lambic the last 3-4 months and this is one of the reasons I go to Stockholm regularly (I work now in Oslo, Norway).","Oslo, NORWAY","DanielNylander99"
4411,"2000-12-01",4.2,"Cloudberry lambic made for Akkurat pub in Stockholm.  Yes, it is very sour, but unlike certain other Cantillon fruit beers, this one you can actually taste the fruit, as the cloudberry flavour bursts out.  Very juicy and refreshing. Earthy notes.  A side note - if you thought Cantillon was expensive in the USA, you should see how much it costs in Sweden!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
