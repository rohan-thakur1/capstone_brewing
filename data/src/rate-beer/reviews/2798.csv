How: Tap at Na Parkanu, Pilsen, Czech Republic
The look: Clear golden copper body with a large creamy off-white head
To me a typical Czech Polotmavé (Czech Amber Lagers) is: Hay and biscuit wrapped in caramel.  Very light fruity notes with no specific fruits giving the impression of slightly fruity caramel.  Moderately sweet.  Sweetness is well balanced by dry grassy hops.  Body is smooth.  Medium carbonation.
This one: As above but a bit better put together than most.  A typical but very good example of the style.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2798,"2008-03-27",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Expressive caramel biscuits cleanly purport ideas of refreshment and long evenings in this professionally constructed, balanced Polotmavé.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A mountain of foam establishes its kingdom atop the shiny copper translucence.
-Some wooden hop bitterness cleverly interrupts the malty reign.
-These hops only seem to appear in the last half of the sip.
-The body is healthy and the level of residual sugars maintains a pleasant middle ground.

Sweet aroma with scents of toffee and caramel. A bit flat but quite smooth with a nice slightly bitter somewhat sweet caramel after taste. A bit lingering and sticky, which I love, so I am a bit impartial. One of the best beers in prague. Even comes with its own elegant napkin coaster. Better at U Suru!","West Caldwell, New Jersey, USA","JdKrone"
