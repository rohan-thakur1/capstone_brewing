Aroma sucks - lets be honest. Its alcoholic brown sugar. But the taste is incredible, mind-blowing. Hint of chocolate, some caramel, with lots of sweet brown sugar and malt absolutely bombard the tastebuds. Smooth, not overly-carbonated. Packs a massive punch - be careful, its 9.5%.

How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed when almost one year of age.  Bottle from mcberko, thanks Matt
The look: Dark mahogany body topped by a beige ring of foam
In long: Nose is a cross between a raisin pie and a walnut pie with some fresh tobacco.  The aroma was far from explosive, rather discreet actually, but what it offers is actually pleasant.  From the aroma I was expecting something nice but the taste is a bit on the boring side.  Sweet creamy nutty malts, earthy notes, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce (really!), soft liquorice candy, pastry, dark caramel, raisins, subtle chocolate.  A lot of nice individual flavour elements but somehow the whole thing was less than the sum of its parts.  Still, this was a nice beer and it sure was easy to drink for a near 10% brew.  I dont have a clue what Hermannator means, if it means anything at all, but I dont have the energy nor the time to look it up, or maybe I have the energy and I dont have the time, or maybe I have the time and not the energy, whatever, Im not looking it up.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Second, there is a noticeable variance in the taste profile from year to year. To be fair I have based my rating on the best of the years I sampled which was the 09 (followed closely by the 07, the 08 and 10 were inferior). Pours a dark brown with minor head. Aroma has a hint of molasses, raisins, pluminess. Alcohol is well worked in. Rich, with a thick syrupy character. Theres a subtle hint of chocolate. Good balance. Overall the beer is hit and miss.

Sweet, alcohol, fusels, dark chocolate with a rather outspoken liquorice finish. Some vanilla-wood. Definitely some brandy- or rumlike characteristics, but it just isn’t viscous enough for being called brandy-like. Absolutely surprisingly ""light"" MF for such a beer, in the sense that it is neither oily, viscous or syrupy, but still carbonated-beery.

One of Canadas better eisbocks...do something  the heading on this brew ( like pump up the unmalted protiens and youll be there VBC.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

Pretty mild sweet grainy malt and light booze aroma, some dry yeast and light sweet spice (6+).  Mild fruity taste - raisin, bit of cherry, chocolate toffee malt, alcohol and some hop bitterness.  Thin, slick body, flat, alcoholic and mildly astringent.  Pretty thin for an eisbock, but okay.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Aroma just smells dark and mysterious to me. Toasty, deeper sharper smell. (I see tobacco mentioned in earlier ratings. I can identify with that.)
Mouthfeel is slightly effervescent at first, cloying alc. sweetness that finishes slightly sour. As it warms fruitier tones come out and the alc. gets stickier.","Lakeville, Minnesota, USA","Trev"

4485,"2006-03-11",3.8,"Bottle from Josh Oakes and served in my Great Lakes snifter: Pours a nice ruby and rusty hue with an initial fizzy head that quickly fades, oily cling. The nose has notes of molasses, plum, prune, clove, black pepper, a hint of smoke and caramel, along with a moderate vinous quality.  The flavor profile is heavy sweet malt, rich dark fruits, and a dash of alcoholic snap. I really dug this much more than it appeared my fellow ratebeerians. Sure it rather straight forward but is lush and the most hidden alcohol character seems to allow the flavors to be slowly enjoyed.  A wonderful sipping brew. Every once in a while, I seem to go against the norm, this would be one of those beers. If you like a rich malty beer, then I say try this one on for size.  (oh, my Dad liked the sample I gave him, that is rare...his middle name is Herman...hum?)","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
4485,"2006-03-09",2.8,"Clear dulled brown, fading off-white cover. Dried nuts and oily toffee pair along with molasses to create a lightly sweet, earthy, syrupy malt profile. Feeling quite contentrated in mouth, but with a bit too much grain flavour for my liking. Nutty sweet and not evolving much. Has that brown ale roastiness that tries to balance the sweetness, but its nothing too natural. Interesting dark fruit suggestions. Light-medium body, mild syrupiness, low carbonation. Very honest.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4485,"2006-03-06",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2008 Any first impressions?
-A darkened mauve lifts a weary ring of foam.
-Prune alcohol, and spicy, clove-y black grapiness form a simple, sweet perfume.
-Detached roastiness watches on as caramel malts and candied fruitiness build a distinct bock personality.
-The low carbonation doesnt serve the relative thinness of the body.

What if you dig deeper?
-It finishes quickly with a filet of residual sweetness.
-The puréed dates are quite pleasant.
-The mouthfeel gets complacent after a few sips.
-All in all, this is a little too simple for its own good; a decent attempt but a little flaccid for the long run.

4485,"2004-12-13",3.4,"On opening:plums,and fermented prunes.pours a very nice dark malt colour,like a bright black.Very small head that is dark tan and does not stick around,no lacing.

on taste:It is like a Abby,without the sweetness.Starts with a very mild molasses that turns to ripe plums and spice,the middle is warm,the finnish is dry,and mildly Carmel.

This beer has more bite then carbonation,at the front,good and comforting mouth-feel.

This is a one beer beer per night.

why you should try this beer:well put together,has quite a kick to it.Seasonal so if you dont you wont.
Why you should not try this beer: well it is a little light on carbonation and a little high on price.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","stephen louis"

4485,"2004-11-07",3.1,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2005 2005 version.  9.5% ABV this time around.  Dark brown beer with a thick light brown head.  Sweet, but clean caramel aroma.  A bit earthy, some molasses, light toast.  Flavour is of sweet malt, a bit earthy and peppery with a touch of nuttiness toward the finish.  Feels more like a cold-conditioned ale than a proper eisbock.  Seems much lighter than 9.5% ABV.  Not all that great.

2004 version.  Dark mahogany coloured beer, off-white head fading to a thin lace.  Aroma is quite subtle, dark malts and fruits, some molasses, soya sauce, butterscotch, toffee, and light roastiness.  Flavour is similar, fruit, soya, some alcohol is noticable, but well restrained.  Slightly syrupy body.  Sweet finish.  Not bad.

4485,"2003-01-04",4.2,"Back again for another year, this all new 2002 Ice Bock is brewed to commemorate their 15th Anniversary, and as such, was limited to a run of merely 10,000 bottles.  Its more than worth the search as it hits the Ice Bock concept straight on the head.

This sweet and full bodied beer is highlighted by exceptional blend of malts and carbination resulting in a true warming beer that has an interesting punch.   Pours very clean and perky with a decent sized head full of large bubbles which give way to a strong collar and minimal lacing on the glass.

Aroma wise the sweet malty smells come through as does a certain amount of bitterness, but the sweetness is what really sets this one apart.  

A great drinking beer, that would definitely fall into a warming ale more so than Youngs Winter Warmer, (but thats another story).

4485,"2000-12-13",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2016 Fresh, in 2007 Very dark brown.  Not much head in my ceramic Hacker mug but there never is with this beer. Aroma is light molasses with an earth accent and a hint of alcohol.  Rich, with a thick syrupy toffee/earth character, a hint of chocolate and a boozy, woody finish.  Nice balance.  The biggest difference this year is the significant decrease in carbonation...that was a major peeve in recent years and theyve worked it out.  Now the malts show through much better and quite frankly it really comes across as the most eisbocky Hermannator I can remember.  Past editions hovered around the 3.5 range.2005 Vintage, aged 10 years.  Pours dark brown, flat, with some sediment.  Aroma of soy sauce, and some sweeter darker malts.  Some richer soy sauce notes, but quickly these fade into not much...it is just sort of thin.  Basically the impression I get is a thinner, hollowed-out version of fresh Hermannator.  Definitely not worth aging, at least not this long.  2 6 5 2 9","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
