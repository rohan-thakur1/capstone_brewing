1100,"2015-02-06",3.1,"4cl on tap at Mikkeller Bangkok beer week.
Almost no head. Clear pale golden pour. It looks like a glass of white wine. Dry slightly tart aftertaste. Quite decent.","Chiang Mai, THAILAND","deanso"
1100,"2014-10-19",2.4,"Aroma is pears, mild sweetness and plastic. The flavor is pears, mild sweetness and a tangy/tart finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1100,"2014-10-11",3.2,"Bottle sample at Beer Market Jaffa. Thanks Ariel. Very pale golden, white-wine-like color, slightly hazy. Aroma of pears, some green apples, a light sugary hint and some sulphur. Flavor has light sweetness at first, but quickly turns dry and mildly sourish, with pears, some apples and a slightly astringent finish. Refreshing.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
1100,"2014-08-17",3.1,"Bottle.

Head is initially very small, fizzy, fully diminishing.
Body is light yellow.

Aroma is notes of white wine (green grape, lime zest, minerals, oak), apple/pear skin.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic.

Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation, lightly astringent.

This has a somewhat promising, wine-like nose, but ultimately its pretty simple and soda-like.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Really nice cider. Probably the best Pear cider I have had!
Nice color and aroma.
Perfect balance between sweet and tart. Really refreshing. Will definitely buy again if I see it.","SINGAPORE","Hnui999"
1100,"2014-04-20",3.4,"330ml bottle. As with alot of cidres, beut packagingBeer is an extremely hazed pale white. Supper bubbly and effervescent, no head. Smell is crisp but a bit rotteny, subtle earth and band aid. Flavor is nicely dry. Flavor has a bit of tartnes in the finish. It is earthy, slightly rotten, not bad.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1100,"2014-04-17",2.8,"This is a pretty decent perry. It has clean fermentation characteristics which lend a pure pear flavor. It is just a bit sweet and very slightly sticky but still drinkable with medium carbonation. This seems to be bottle conditioned with yeast in the bottle and despite being pretty careful, I ended up with a pretty cloudy glassful. Overall, this isnt bad stuff even if its a touch on the bland side.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1100,"2014-03-11",4.0,"Light fruity aroma. Clear pale yellow colour with no head. Nice dry pear flavour slightly mulled. Med body and carbonation.

1100,"2013-11-08",2.9,"Feels a touch sweet following the Zeffer Apple but noticialbly less acidity which may account for the perception of sweetness. Good fruit through the palate and a seamless finish. One of the nicer pear ciders I have tried.","NEW ZEALAND","turnermj"
1100,"2013-05-09",4.3,"Honey notes on the nose. A slight sweetness that doesnt linger. Good notes of pear with a slightly tropical finish. All in all a very good pear cider at the dryer end of the scale.","","ciderpro"
1100,"2013-04-02",1.9,"very subtle flavours. a little on the sweet side but its so subdued that its not really much of anything. pears are hiding in there somewhere. it isnt bad but its oddly shy and could be a bit more...well, existent.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","lisagirl"
1100,"2013-02-24",3.6,"Sampled at the 2013 Chicago Cider Summit. Pours a clear pale watery yellow with a slight white head that starts at the edges and dissipates completely. Aroma has mild dry pear with just a touch of sweetness. Flavor has dry/tart pear with some sweetness coming through.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1100,"2012-12-26",3.4,"Bottle. Hazy yellow, scant bubbles. Aroma of dusty and fleshy pear, subtle citrus. Taste is semi sweet fruit. Full bodied. Decent.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1100,"2012-07-17",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2012 Bottle from Mane Liquor. Not over done by the pear which is pleasing as some pear ciders can be overly musky with too much pear in them. This one is rather relaxed and a little subdued. Light tartiness to begin with which is drawn out by a very dry pear finish. Nicely done and very velvety on the palate","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
1100,"2012-05-19",1.9,"Pale, sharp and dry. The alcohol adds more sweetness than the fruit, and the palate is a little musty. Disappointing.","AUSTRALIA","YAFB"
1100,"2010-10-19",3.4,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy pale straw with a pinkish hue. Quite a sweet and sour pear aroma. The palate starts out with a big tartness that draws out in the aftertaste. The pear flavour is not strong, this is more about the palate - sour and slightly musty.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"
