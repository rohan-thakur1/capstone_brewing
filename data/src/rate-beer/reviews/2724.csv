Tapped out gold. 6ºSRM.

Nose is actually pretty floral of a lager with some nice citrus notes like ripe lemons or just ripe oranges, grapefruit juice.

Mouthfeel is watery. Palate has some nice clean pale malt and wheat malt flavors with bread dough and white bread predominating. Hops are aggressive and bitter with grapefruit peel, lemon and lime zest. Some cilantro spice, but overall populated with fresh, citrus, herbaceous and grassy flavors.

Finish is clean, lightly beery.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"
