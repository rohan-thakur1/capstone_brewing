4361,"2016-01-22",3.4,"Bottled on 28/06/2014. Kirkkaan lagerimainen väri, olematon vaahto. Tuoksu mietoa ipamaisuutta kissankusen kera, bonuksena väkevyyttä, luumuviinaakin lämmettyään. Suutuntuma vahva mutta mieto, ristiriitainen yhdistelmä. Jälkifiiliksenä vahva alapäinen alkoholinen överiannostus ilman kompensoivaa yläkitalaen fiilistä, lämmintä marjaa löytyy myös lämpöisenä. Lämpöisenä lasin pohjia juodessa aika kiva, ensin alkuun en lämmennyt.","TAMPERE, FINLAND","Jultsu"
4361,"2015-12-08",3.6,"750ml bottle. A gift from Hives. Hazy orange. Film and a few bubbles of white. Nose is peachy sweet. Yeasty, bready malts. Soft toffee. A bit of booze. Taste is robust, chewy sweet, with some hefty bitterness. Rich and full bodied. Finishes with a vanilla sweetness, and a bosh of boozy rich bitterness. Definitely a grower. I warmed to it, and it warmed me!","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
4361,"2015-08-29",3.8,"Flaske (thanks, Steven!), delt med Ovesen på Holmens aktivitetsdag: opp fra et flott skum(som varer helt til siste slurk) stiger en velduft av mango, appelsin, fersken, tørkede frukter sammen med en knivsodd pepper. Og smaken er bare helt yummy, balansert og elegant. Varmer i magen, dette er lekre saker! På etiketten står det Imperial pale stout. Burde det heller stått Stout imperial pale ale?","Stavanger, NORWAY","Holmen1"

4361,"2015-05-30",3.4,"Bottle from Whistle Stop Wines in Saltburn. Pours golden with a white head. Mild citrus aroma. The taste is lots of citrus and spice. Along with pretty evident alcohol.

Appearance - 
Nose - oranges, maybe even burnt oranges. Malty backdrop.
Taste - burnt oranges mangled with dry malt.
