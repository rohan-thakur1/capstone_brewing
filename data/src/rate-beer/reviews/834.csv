834,"2017-04-30",3.0,"Golden, and distinctly on the pils side of the balance. The coffee is a complementary flavor here, rather than the driving force and raison detre. Some richer palate and stronger alcohol but decent. On tap at The News Room, Minneapolis.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

834,"2017-04-13",3.6,"Bought for $4 (+tip) on draft. Presented in a pint glass. Bright golden body and very little head. Nose is what it ought to be, that of cold press coffee. This doesnt pretend to be a stout like maNY blond stouts. Its unique as is. A basic clean lager with a pleasant coffee addition. Textually its on point. The palate has a flash of coffee roasted flavor, then finishes crisp. A beer brewed well, where it feels lighter than the indicated ABV.","","balloonbuffoon"
