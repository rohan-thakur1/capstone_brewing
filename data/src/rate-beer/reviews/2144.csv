Hazy, dark copper-brown with a tan head.
Caramel, tangy wood aroma.
Flavour is lightly smoky, acidic wood, caramel malt.....with a background sensation of cooling evergreen.
Really different.....and very pleasing.
Special gratitude to Shrubber85 for acquiring this hard to find style.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2144,"2017-03-26",3.7,"Draft. Sour milk, orange, smoky caramel malt and hay aroma. Cloudy brown with large tan head. Sweet-tart lactic orange, caramel malt, and mildly bitter hay/light juniper flavor. Good body. Interesting.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2144,"2016-09-06",4.0,"Draft at Urban Artifact, served in a goblet. What luck to find this the weekend after Bewilderfest, where it was tapped on Sunday night at 10. I figured itd last into the week, but not this long. Big style get for me. It pours a hazy unpolished brass color with a small off-white head that settles into a ring and an island of film. Really unusual stuff. Has a lemon-lime tartness with a subtle smokiness throughout, with tree bark, earth, chocolate, sour stone fruits, and minerals. Light-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a tart, smoky, earthy mouthfeel. Very subtly dry and bitter, as well. Really fun stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2144,"2016-09-03",3.6,"Draft. Poured hazy amber color with an average white frothy head that mostly lasted with very good lacing. Moderate sweet smoked malt and sour yeast aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet & sour flavor with a medium sour & sweet finish of moderate duration. Good drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2144,"2016-08-24",3.7,"On tap at Crest in Clintonville: brownish orange pour, light tan head. aroma of nutty, bready, light smoke. tastes are yeasty, caramel, grain, herbal. smoke was drowned out a bit by more sour than I was expecting - we were speculating that the end of the keg may have played a role higher sour level. interesting overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DialSquare"
2144,"2016-07-03",3.8,"On Draught 
Pours a hazy light Amber color with a medium sized head and good lace on the glass. 

The aroma is weird, funky... Sort of like tea, sort of smoky, a touch fruity... Cool. 

The flavor is all lemony and smoky and rich and tart and just tasty af. Fruity but dry with a mild bitterness. Chill","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2144,"2016-06-04",3.8,"At Charlevoix Craft Beer Festival. Amber pour with an off-white head. Sweet/sour fruit, caramel and smoke in the taste and aroma.","Bellaire, Michigan, USA","bpar73"
2144,"2016-01-19",3.7,"On tap at JP Detroit. An amber hazy pour with a white head. Aromas of caramel, nuttiness, earthiness, bubble gum. Flavor has caramel, toasty malt, bubble gum. Its not bad, but I cant say I really recognize the juniper. Still quite tasty.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
2144,"2015-12-23",3.5,"On tap at Jolly Pumpkin A2. Pours a clear amber with a tan head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma combines a light smokiness with a bit of light fruit and some sweet grains. Flavor has an interesting smoke and sweet fruit backbone with a sweet grain finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2144,"2015-12-02",3.0,"Tap at JP Ann Arbor. Aroma is smoked meat, sourdough, and light flowers. Tastes the same. Thick and doughy. Finish has a sort of chemical/mint/herbal taste. Very odd and throws it off. Meh.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
