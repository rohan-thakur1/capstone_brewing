866,"2007-08-03",3.3,"Very clear colour, water like, lots of alcohol legs, very still.  The aroma has some alcohol, light cherries and some chocolate.  The flavour has some alcohol warmth, moderate sweetness, the chocolate is still lingering around, rich.  Clean mouthfeel, light body, no carbonation.  Finishes hot, lingering.  This was a weird one.  I quite enjoyed this new experience.  Its hard to believe that something so clear holds so much flavour.

866,"2007-03-17",3.2,"Bottle. Very clear colour as a still water. Nice legs are to be seen though, so perhaps a few point marks there. Aroma of alcohol, sugar, caramel, and cinammon. Sweet alcohol warmth flavour and particularly so in the throaty finish. Decent complexity with waves of darkish plumy/raisin flavour. Good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"

866,"2004-01-30",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2004 An almost nonexistent aroma.  This brewery has been around for over 300 years, so I think I can safely assume that they intended this Daiginjo to be the way it is - with no aroma.  I'm surprised Tamanohikari didn't go with the clear bottle as it'd allow them to highlight the clearness of this quality drink, although there is the slightest yellowish hue present (OK, but it's VERY faint indeed).  A thicker mouthfeel, with some richness.  I don't find it very acidic or striking up front.  Yet, it's not as light as Kaika, Umenishiki or Ohtouka, which are some of my favorites.  While those are so light you can barely feel them on your tongue, the Tamanohikari makes its presence known and has an abrupt alcohol burn that's reminiscent of a Ginjo more than a Daiginjo.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
