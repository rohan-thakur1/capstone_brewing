4208,"2008-08-12",3.5,"Ironically enough, I announced less than a week before this beer came out, that they should name it the ""I’ll be bock"". Funny how things work out.. Anyways, pours a dark, clear copper colour with a medium sized white head. Aroma is moderately malty, with a clear nutty and roated malts character. Sweet, toasted almonds and caramel in the nose. Taste is full, well carbonated with plenty of sweet flavor but not over powering. tatey all around.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
4208,"2008-06-23",3.4,"This brewer does german styles well, and this is no exception - its not as creamy as I like my bocks, but it doesnt have the overpowering sweetness that most have - some light caramel, and a strong nutty character - the sweetness is tempered by a light roasty character - I agree with JK, this is much like a doppel.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4208,"2008-05-07",3.4,"[growler] shared by skyview. Pours a clear dark brown with a medium tannish head. Lots of brown sugar and yeast on the nose. Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel. Flavor is quite malty and a little astringent, but quite good.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"
4208,"2008-05-04",3.6,"[Growler, thanks Skyview!] Pours cola-brown with a light tan head. Aroma is big on caramel malt with another smell that I cannot place but that I have noticed in a few other Titletown beers. Nothing too complex in the taste either as it is also big on caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel with a long finish. A pretty simple beer, but it was quite drinkable and not bad at all.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
4208,"2008-05-03",3.5,"growler thanks to skyview. dark brown color, musty aroma. nutty, coffee and burnt caramel flavors. tasty.","st paul, Minnesota, USA","beoir"
4208,"2008-05-03",3.7,"Thanks to Skyview for another growler.  Sweet caramel and malt aroma.  More of the same in the flavor, with just a touch of smoke.  This is comparable to Optimator, but just a hair short of the quality of that beer.  Good, style appropriate dark brown appearance and thick palate, almost like a doppelbock.  One of the best brewpub-made bocks I have had.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
4208,"2008-05-01",3.7,"A growler from Skyview.  Dark brown color with a thin head.  Caramely aroma.  Nice caramel, dry chocolate and fresh grain taste.  Almost some wheat.  Slightly sugary.  Very nice.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4208,"2008-04-27",3.7,"I had this one a couple weeks ago but lost my notes. Oh well, back to the brewpub in Green Bay for another try. Pours a clear dark cola brown brew with a creamy beige head that has some good retention and spotty lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malt, semi-sweet caramel malt with a touch of chocolate and flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, with flavors of toasted dark malt, some slight toffee with a mild and dry bitterness. Finish has a semi-sweet aftertaste at first with some brown sugar and then quickly disappears to a toasted dark malt aftertaste. Multiple personality  beer and quite tasty.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
4208,"2008-04-07",3.1,"Rusty copper color with a moderate taupe head. Aromas of sweet grain, caramel, touch of husk and dark cherries. Flavors with light sweet fruit and lightly toasted malt. Touch of woody bitterness. Seems more like a strong amber.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4208,"2008-03-29",3.7,"Pours a dark ruby color with thick, tannish, frothy head that fades quickly.  Aroma is light toasted grain, caramel and light fruity hops.  Taste is much the same as the aroma.  Carbonation is moderate and the finish is clean and to the point.  Good stuff.  Kind of reminds me of a lighter Railyard Ale.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"
