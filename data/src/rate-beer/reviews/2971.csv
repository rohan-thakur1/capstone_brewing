2971,"2014-08-21",2.8,"Draft... Pours hazy and yellow with a small, creamy, white head. Great retention. The nose is musky, pissy and earthen. Full-bodied with stinging carbonation. The flavor is laden with sweet cereal grains and corn, countered by sufficient bitterness and plenty of acetaldehyde. Green apple, bittersweet finish that wasnt as harsh as expected. After looking at previous ratings of this beer and many ratings on this website over the past twelve years Ive concluded that most raters dont know the difference between diacetyl and acetaldehyde. This is actually a pretty darn good malt liquor. Fusel alcohols? Of course. Its a malt liquor. But diacetyl? In this? Please. Read a BJCP book.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2971,"2014-03-28",3.0,"Draft during my San Francisco/Reno trip last June. Pours a hazy yellow golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma and flavor have sweet malts, corn, mild citrus and floral hops, cookie bread, pilsner like notes. This doesnt really appeal to me.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2971,"2013-12-12",3.0,"Tap @ Zombie Burger, courtesy of the bartender who poured it for me, after I paid him. Pours a hazy yellow, grainy, leafy. Tastes better than other malt likkas Ive had. Slightly boozy.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
2971,"2013-11-27",3.4,"Pours a hazy yellow with a small head and some lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is funky with some leafy hops, some hay... some fruitiness. 

The flavor is boozy with plenty of leafy hoppiness. As it ""opens up its got some bitterness, some grape drank booziness, some tire-like things, some other stuff. 


Geeze, I sorta liked this brew.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2971,"2013-11-21",3.1,"On tap at Of Love and Regret in Baltimore. Pours a hazy yellow. A bit funky. A little dirty diaper. Yeasty and bready. Slightly sour but finishes somewhat sweet.","Arkansas, USA","BOSSbrewer"
2971,"2013-07-13",2.0,"transparent gold, thin white head, lasting. moderate diacetyl in nose, light tequila citrus, heavy nasty esters all over. Flavor is racked with heavy cotton candy and butter front, more sugar and burnt caramel mid with lightly crusty, hot finish of mushy malt and hot, stinging burn. Blech.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
2971,"2013-07-06",3.5,"On tap. Pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Floral fruity candy sugar and alcohol aroma and taste with a decent citrus flavor and a sweet finish. Not bad for a malt liquor.","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
2971,"2013-06-20",2.9,"Draft at blue monk, certainly not my favorite from typically a great brewery. Pale yellow pour. Medicinal aroma and flavor. Band aids. Rubbing alcohol. Medium bodied. Ok","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
2971,"2013-05-19",1.1,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2013 Tap at church key.  $6 for a 4 oz pour, my brothers.  Notes of rotten cotton candy.  Solvent.  Burnt tires.  Not too good of a beer.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
2971,"2013-05-17",3.5,"Draft at Alla Spina. Pours a cloudy golden with virtually no head or lace. Nose of citrus, honey, caramel, cotton candy, booze. Sweet, citrusy and boozy. A bit syrupy with average carbonation. Certainly an interesting beer, not exactly St. Ides.","Pennsylvania, USA","tcane7"
2971,"2013-05-17",3.1,"Tap @ Maxs. Pours hazy yellow with a small, fizzy white head, short retention with light lacing. Aroma is corn and Pils malt and light fruits.

2971,"2013-05-17",2.4,"Tap. Pours hazy gold with average, creamy white head; decent retention and spare lacing. Aroma is movie popcorn, banana, cookie malt, pear, and floral notes. Flavor is bready malts, light fruit, straw, and faint floral hops with butter notes throughout; dry finish. Medium body and low carbonation.","Federal Hill, Baltimore, Maryland, USA","sonnycheeba"
2971,"2013-05-17",3.3,"Draft.  Minimal off-white head atop cloudy amber body.  Aroma is moderately sweet, rye, caramel, light alcohol, apricot.  Taste is moderately sweet, caramel, rye, some spicy, light alcohol.  Medium-full body, low carbonation, some stickiness.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2971,"2013-05-14",0.7,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2013 draft.  browned / rotting bananas, makeup power and burnt butter nose.  goopy, yeasty, sweet, round and full body with noticeable solvent and medium-high acidity. foul-tasting.  sorry Brian.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2971,"2013-05-14",1.8,"Tap at Churchkey. Shared with 3fourths, ryan, and biggirlpanties. Pours a low haze straw, overcarbonated massive white head. Nice but suddy looking lacing. Nose is just not very good. Diacetyl is my first thought with really sweet caramel and nearing rancid dairy. Sticky sugar moving to rotting bananas and near fusel alcohol. As it warms, I get something like vanilla frosting and white birthday cake. But it is all behind an onslaught of rancid notes that must be ignored. Taste is hard to get though with that aroma, but diacetyl is still present at a rancid dairy level, some sharp burning alcohol heat. Palate is slick, chewy, rotting banana. No one really enjoyed this and just set it back on the bar.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2971,"2013-05-13",3.4,"Draft. Hazy golden color, fluffy white head. Aroma of white pepper, hay, caramel. Taste is dry and slightly bitter. My favorite malt likka of the night!","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2971,"2013-02-28",3.6,"Draft at Proletariat with streets, Andy, max and Zdk. Pours a deep hazy amber orange with no head, super light white bubbles.  Aroma is strange - interesting hops, sweet sweet malts, candy and light booze. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth with notes of sweet, citrus hops, malts, spice and light booze. Maybe some very faint Bret in the back as it warms. One of the best malt liquors Ive tried. All things considered, very drinkable.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2971,"2012-09-08",3.5,"August 19, 2012 - on draught at King William IV Witterfest.  Belgian Malt Likkah - cool!  Hazy gold, smallish white head.  Aroma - alcohol, slightly sugary fruit, lemon zest and some floral bitterness (7-).  Taste - a bit like Lennys Rye-PA, but not quite as boozy or sweet - grain, dry lemon tartness, pungent floral bitterness - big, but not obnoxious.  Average body, a little slick and alcohol-drying, solid carbonation, dry coating finish, a little sugary in the aftertaste - damned fine malt likker - spect!!!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
2971,"2012-09-08",3.7,"19th August 2012On tap at the King William IV - Witterfest. Hazy gold beer, little white head. Light palate, slightly crisp and with mild dryness. Mild grapefruit with mild tropical fruits with pineapple most noticeable. Soft peach, subtle tangerine and mild esters. Finishes dry with mild seltzer minerals.

2971,"2012-08-21",2.7,"Keg at Fanø Meet the Brewer, King William IV. It pours lightly hazy golden yellow, with a massive white head. The nose is corn, grain, butter toast, sweet malt and light sulphur. The taste is sweet malt, corn, dough, white sugar, butter and light spice.  Medium body, fine carboantion and slight stickiness. Not much to it, but at least it drinks under its percentage.... Probably the worst beer at this rather impressive event!","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
2971,"2012-08-17",3.1,"Tap @ Fanø. Pours orange with a creamy head and lacings.Nose is pear youghurt with some butter beneath. Really bitter and dry flavor. Pear, banana and grass. Odd. Heavy warmth from alcohol.","Odense, DENMARK","Dedollewaitor"

2971,"2012-07-30",3.1,"Tap @ Fanø.
Pours muddy yellow with a small, staying, creamy, white head. Aroma has clear yoghurt,maize, citrus, pear and apple. Highish carbonation, rather light and mildly dry mouthfeel. (You can feel that the corn doesnt add much body). Flavour is far better than the aroma, crisp, vinious, grainy. Fine citrussy hops. Light warming and mildly bitter finish.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
2971,"2012-07-29",3.0,"On tap. Pours a cloudy golden with a lacing white head. Rather odd aroma sorta buttery....or rather margarine? Medium body, kinda thick still. Malty? Nah, not really. Hoppy?

2971,"2012-06-22",3.7,"15/06/2012 Ma che siete venuti a fà (tap). Dorata, intensa, lievemente torbida, schiuma bianca abbondante e morbida, abbastanza persistente. Al naso è indecifrabile, presenta note agrumate e speziate, di lieviti e cereali. In bocca è molto particolare, un mix originalissimo di differenti stili, con un finale amaro molto prolungato e persistente. Lalcol non si sente per nulla. Corpo medio, carbonazione corretta. Caotica e confusionaria, ma affascinante. Una piacevole scoperta.","Rome, ITALY","Mortlach"

Huge white head on cloudy milky golden body.
Spicy, citric and fresh.
Very very hoppy, almost IPA-like. Creamy like a wheat beer and yeasty.
I like this:-)","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"
