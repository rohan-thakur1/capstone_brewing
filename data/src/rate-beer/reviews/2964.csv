A touch papery and tired. Oily. Cherry fruit lozenges. Definitely boozy. Good under-the-bridge option.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

2964,"2015-05-27",2.9,"Entering old notes- sampled with RBWG. Pours a hazy orange with a white head. Nose is cherry, booze, cough medicine, and some vanilla and sweetness. Flavor hits with all kinds of craziness: cherry, vanilla, citrus, booze, cough syrup, and some nightmare fuel. One for the history books for sure.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

2964,"2015-03-27",3.2,"rbwg2015. Courtesy of drowland, thanks Danny. It pours with a hazy peach to gold body that supports a thin near white head. The aroma offers up loads of oak and then heading into smooth cherry and mild tart tannin like odors. The taste has a nice modest cherry sensation thats blended with oak and earthy citrus fruit. This comes across pretty nice as the apple  honey  booze  pear sugary esters are off banging around in the background where there are three tubas just sitting there.

2964,"2015-02-22",3.3,"Poured a light pinkish color with aromas of cherries, booze, bread, and light oak. Flavors were bread and harsh alcohol with some light cherries and a smudge of oak.

2964,"2013-07-19",3.1,"hazy ruby red, white head. Very cherry forward, not getting much else but booze in this one. Kind of like drinking squirt w/ some grenadine added with a shot of liquor. Im not saying thats a bad thing, kool aid malted liquor, my brothers.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
