3705,"2016-10-21",3.3,"On tap @ BrewDog, Soho. This one has a blurry deeper golden looking color. On the top theres a medium sized lacing beigeish head, lots of lacings down the glass. On the aroma it has a soft biscuity sweetness. Malt-caramel and a little red Berry fruitiness. It sure has a distinct flavor this. Really candy sweet - yet it has a strong bitterness. Weed-bitterness. Its mild oily in the mouth and its just above average on the carbonation. A little astringent after a while. Good old saft. Dry long tail. A little strange perhaps, but I still kinda liked it. 21.10.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
