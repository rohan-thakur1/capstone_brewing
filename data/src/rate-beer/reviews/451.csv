451,"2017-02-20",4.2,"Appearance: Densely black body with a huge mocha colored head that refuses to let up. Very nice looking.

Smell: Vanilla bean, coffee, milk chocolate and cocoa powder. Very pronounced and the aroma just keeps my attention and doesnt let go. Perfect.

Taste: Very pronounced cocoa powder. Like im literally eating the powder. Good coffee presence with the vanilla more in the background. When i first taste it, i found it to be lacking a little but after swallowing, the flavors linger quite a long time. Opens up a lot more as it nears room temperature. A nice lasting moderate bitterness rounds things out. The only thing keeping me from scoring a 5 on the taste is i would have liked more vanilla flavor front and center with the cocoa. Still, it has a nice complex taste.

Mouthfeel: Smooth like velvet this beer is. Non-obtrusive carbonation that keeps its place but gives little pinpricks here and there. Straddles well between coarse and creamy though it does have a more smooth edge than otherwise. Full-bodied without being heavy at all which is quite a feat.","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"

This is specially true when it comes to stouts and trappist beers, since Im not such a huge fan of those as everyone else seems to be. Well, in this case I have to take my hat off and nod in agreement. The aroma is a bomb of chocolate with notes of bourbon and vanilla, just as it promises. Colour is pure black with a tanned, thick and consistent head. Taste, although not that complex, is very pleasant and mostly sweet, but it leaves fantastic bitter finish. The alcohol is noticeable and if feels a bit like liquor, but its not at all overwhelming. Soft carbonation and slightly creamy body.

Version 2016: Robe noire opaque avec de très minces reflets brunâtres, col de mousse brun et laiteux qui disparaît rapidement pour ne laisser quun mince voile. Arômes de malt grillé frais, quelques notes de houblons, chocolat au lait, grains de café et de vanille qui ne semble pas vouloir simposer. Je pourrais presque comparer le nez à un sweet stout. Peut-être la bière est-elle encore trop jeune? En bouche, une entrée marquée par le cacao. On remarque aussi rapidement le la texture plutôt aqueuse du liquide. Arrivent ensuite la vanille et le café ainsi quune touche de houblons. Ces derniers apportent plus une certaine fraicheur que de laromatique. La longue finale est surtout concentrée sur le cacao arrosé dune goutte de vanille. Un peu de noisettes amères et café moulu. Comme je disais, texture aqueuse et corps moyen. 

Version 2014: Sensiblement la même robe avec un col de mousse un tantinet plus foncé qui sestompe un petit peu plus vite et qui ne laisse pas de voile. Arômes de malt rôti, chocolat noir aux petits fruits (début de madérisation mais à peine), de la vanille sirupeuse, mélasse et notes de café crème et alcool. Un nez beaucoup plus relevé et invitant que la 2016. En bouche, cest encore du cacao mais un peu plus concentré. On ne sent plus lapport du houblon. La vanille ressort elle aussi un peu plus mais le corps lui ne semble pas avoir pris du muscles donc les saveurs ne sont pas plus intenses. Ce goût de vanille sestompe considérablement et sy ajoutent un goût de café et de noisettes avec un peu de poudre de cacao. Le début de madérisation ne paraît pas ici. On a droit à une finale sensiblement pareille à la 2016. Texture encore aqueuse et corps moyen légèrement plus relevé. Bref, deux bières qui semblaient totalement différentes au nez mais qui se retrouvent à suivre la normalité des choses, cest-à-dire un goût somme toute pareil mis à part le houblon qui a pris la poudre descampette. 9-4-8-3-15=3.9","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","Franckg"

451,"2016-05-24",4.6,"Stout warzony z dodatkiem kakao i wanilii.  
 Kolor:  Czarny. Nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Potężna, kremowa, drobnoziarnista. Wokół ścianek szkła gromadzi się szereg beżowych pęcherzyków. Lacing wzrorowy na 5 z plusem. Piana po zamieszaniu TeKu odbudowuje się ponownie. 
 Zapach:  Cholernie intensywny aromat wanilii. Lody waniliowe i cała masa aromatycznych lasek wanilii.
Piwo na kontrze posiada informacje o tym, że nadaje się do długoletniego leżakowania. Nie wyobrażam sobie, żeby mogło po leżakowaniu pachnieć jeszcze mocniej tym składnikiem.
Troszeczkę z boku wanilli wyczuwalne są ziarenka kakaowca i mleczna, słodka czekolada. 
 Smak: W smaku MEGA waniliowe! Płynny waniliowy Milk Shake. 
Na dalszym planie mleczna czekolada, odrobina kawy z mlekiem, coś w stylu Cafe Latte lub Cappuccino. 
Ziarenka kakaowca w odwecie.
Poza tym trochę paloności i likieru czekoladowego.
Piwo jest pełne w smaku. Słodycz wykleja usta i podniebienie. Na języku tworzy się gładka, jedwabista kołderka.
Goryczka średniej siły, gładki krótki finisz.
Oleista, gęsta faktura tylko potęguje uczucie pełni i treściwości.
Cudowna wręcz pijalność.
Boska amrozja prosto od Afrodyty. 
 Wysycenie:  Gładkie, super-niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Do tej pory Beer Geek Breakfast z Mikkeller był dla mnie Numerem 1 w kategorii Stout. Niestety w dniu dzisiejszym został zdeklasowany.

Mało jest takich piw, które jesze długo po degustacji chce się wąchać i spijać każdą kropelkę z butelki, czy szkła.
Z pewnością ""Afrodyta"" do takich się zalicza.
Dwa główne dodatki, które zostały dorzucone w procesie warzenia, zarówno wanilia jak i kakao są intensywne i mocno wyczuwalne.
Dodatkowo kawa z mlekiem i gęsta czekolada dodają smaczku temu Stoutowi.
Bogaty, aromatyczny, pełny i mocny trunek, tak w smaku, jak w aromacie.

Light medium body that is smooth but is slightly creamy in the effervescent finish. Carbonation is balanced well for the body with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a solid burst in the finish.

The flavor profile is quite good, but not as complex as I had hoped. It leads with cocoa that attempts to morph into chocolate, but fails due to a lack of balancing sweetness. The middle is mildly bittered from roast with a bit of hops. The finish is a slow fade that lingers with an unsweetened cocoa note.

Opaque coloration, no bubbles touching the glass. Head is creamy and has impressive retention in spite of being so thin. Nice lacing as I work my way down the glass. Dark chocolate and roast coffee followed by dark chocolate and roast coffee followed by that funny souring milk taste and a bit of vanilla on the finish. Long finish really stays with you, roasty and lactose sweet. Still getting that slightly off sour milk aroma. Full bodied and creamy, not heavy on the palate, moderately mouthcoating and not astringent. Easy to drink as any pint of Guinness Ive ever had, funny smell notwithstanding. Not terrible, but I expected a lot more from this. Flavor profile skews heavy towards roasty but hangs on to some semblance of balance of sweetness and creaminess. Vanilla character never really developed for me, and slight lingering sour milk smell that never entirely went away really spoils the experience, no pun intended.

Fairly thick and creamy, lacing, well retaining, pale greyish beige head over a black beer with yellowish chestnut brown edges. Lovely aroma of first smoked horsemeat and fried mushroom, followed by a deep, fragrant, aromatic sweetness of milk chocolate, hazelnut oil, toffee, chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream and marzipan, further adorned with suggestions of wet leather, butterscotch, pear syrup, black pepper, cold coffee grounds, dried banana, bayleaf and candied fig. Soft umami onset, smoky and meaty with somewhat seaweed- and black olive-like accents, paired with a candied date and dried banana sweetness as well as a deaf, basic, underlying sourishness; soft carbo and very soft, slick, very oily mouthfeel, gliding effortlessly over the tongue with a surprisingly filling body for a beer of merely 6.5% ABV; layer upon layer of nutty, toasted, chocolatey and eventually (gently) bitter roasted maltiness, even a bit coffeeish here and there, carry subtle vanilla and cocoa flavours which beautifully, but subtly return retronasally; finish is very malty, more bitter than sweet, with that initial smoky meatiness lingering, accentuated by the roasted barley bitterness and an explicit, yet well placed peppery and drying hop bitterness. Vanilla beans linger in the nose, adding to the experience and pairing exquisitely well with the overall bitter black chocolate feel of this beer. This is a very sensual, smooth, velvety stout indeed, worth its reputation in all respects; clearly a stout of high class and finesse, with more body than many other 6-7% stouts Ive had, displaying a remarkable suppleness.

451,"2015-07-28",3.9,"I havent had a single beer from this brewer that I thought was only ""okay"". Ive been holding this for months and been tempted so many times to taste it, but held off for one reason or another. A friend mentioned last night that he was on a ""stout binge"" and it dawned on me that I need more stout in my life...Aphrodite worked her magic and she was the first thought that came to mind. Time to taste her.
The pour is a deep, dark chocolate capped with a soft, latte colored foam. Not too deep, half a finger, and with an obvious tendency to dissipate. The freshly poured brew is about 46 degrees, the aroma a rich cocoa and sweet cream, lush with accents of vanilla. I know that my olfactory sensations could be so much different than the experience once the brew passes my lips, and I hang on the aroma for a bit longer than I should. The brew grows warmer...52 degrees. Ill freshen in a moment. -- The first sip is much less sweet chocolate than the scent would suggest and serves up a bitterness that leans more towards dark chocolate; my favorite. The dryness on my tongue and cheeks after I swallow allows me to taste so much more than a cloying sweetness would allow, bravo those hops. 59 degrees. Its very warm in my house. -- I freshen my glass and continue my journey through Aphrodite. The carbonation carries perfectly, the medium body is a bit unexpected, but the creaminess exactly what it needs. The sweet aroma is balanced so well with the raw edge of the taste that I barely notice the difference in the two. They are so very different, and yet, they melt into each other with the complete abandon of lovers. -- Aphrodite. I cant say much more. She knows what the hell shes doing.","USA","lightbias"

Al naso il richiamo dellorzo tostato e del caffè in grani, del cioccolato amaro e della vaniglia; più in sottofondo sentori che ricordano il tabacco ed il cuoio. Laspetto è del tutto simile a quello di una robusta imperial stout, ma questa Aphrodisiaque di alcool ne contiene solo il 6.5%: la sensazione palatale e lintensità del gusto sono altrettanto paragonabili a quelle di una imperial stout, fatta eccezione per la ovvia minor presenza dellalcool. Poco carbonata, morbida e cremosa in bocca, corpo medio, stupisce per lelevata intensità di caffè, vaniglia e cioccolato amaro: la bevuta è a tratti quasi polverosa, quasi a simulare la presenza del caffè macinato e del cacao in polvere. Arriva anche qualche leggerissima nota di prugna disidratata e di tabacco, ed un finale che vede la predominanza dellacidità e dellamaro del caffè, assieme ad una leggera luppolatura resinosa che aiuta a ripulire il palato, lasciando una scia di cioccolato amaro, vaniglia e tabacco.","roma, ITALY","leghorn99"

Excellent. Nice complexity of bitter flavours from the roasted malts, with the usual suspects of coffee and dark chocolate making appearances, but tempered by a lactose sweetness that adds a milky flavour, assisted by the creamy texture.

OCZY : czarne piwo o średniej wielkości jasnobrązowej pianie. Piana jest trwała o rożnej wielkości pęcherzykach. 

NOS : pierwszy niuch to uderzenie wanilii! Takie podobne do lodów waniliowych. Mocnym aromatem jest również czekolada. Dalej wyczuwam śmietanę i kawę z mlekiem. Musze podkreślić, że aromaty tego piwa są niebiańskie. Jeszcze tak przyjemnego aromatu u stouta nie czułem. No może Rogue chocolate stout mógł delikatnie to przypominać. Dalej aromat piwa kojarzy mi się z różnymi pralinkami czy czekoladowymi smakołykami. Nawet M&Msy tak nie pachną. 

USTA : kremowe piwo o konsystencji śmietany i lekkim nasyceniu.
W smaku jest równie dobrze jak w zapachu. Poezja. Tutaj wanilia i czekolada grają główne skrzypce. Aksamitne w buzi. Słodkość tego piwa przypomina subtelnie posłodzone kakao. Gorzkość natomiast jest delikatna i nie zalega. Nawet posmak nie cierpnie jak to się dzieje z kawo podobnymi stoutami. Tutaj aksamitność i kremowość jest na całej długości. Nawet Rogue nie ma tak przyjemnego, klarownego i bogatego posmaku. 

ODCZUCIA : zwaliło mnie to piwo z nóg. Nie spodziewałem się takiej subtelności. Pyszne i satysfakcjonujące każdy wymóg jaki można byłoby sobie postawić piwu w tym stylu. Gorąco polecam.

Aroma of milk chocolate, vanilla, wood notes, roasted malt. Flavour fairly sweet and malty to start, with strong roast, vanilla, slightly woody, also slight anise, then gets more of a powdery cocoa/dark chocolate character with bitterness coming from the roast, maybe from the hops too though the flavour doesnt come through. Finishes reasonably dry but with a bit of sweet malty core lingering. Medium body, silky-smooth, light to medium carbonation.

A: Thick placid black. Dark mocha foam rises up quickly after the pour and completely and totally fades. I have never seen that happy. Beers looks still and lifeless. Great legs though. 

N: Cocoa and malted milk are the first flavors to hit my nose. Theres some vanilla and roast/espresso in here, and a ton of husky, sweet grains. Oats, I think.

T: A very balanced beer. Lots of sweetness on the front of the tongue leads into a very long hop bitterness and a lot of coffee roastedness. Has a sharp acidic bite such as is found in a dry stout. Vanilla starts to shine through at the end of the beer.

M: Alternatively thick and watery at turns. Stains the palate with the coffee. Some alcohol.

O: Pretty powerful stuff if youre in the mood for wake-me-up juice. I could do with a lot more of the vanilla to tone down the java bean flavors. I cant say I dislike it, but at the same time, Im not blown away. Still good though.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

451,"2013-07-09",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2014 Bière noire comme la nuit, aucune lumière ne la traverse, effervescence difficile à observer mais qui semble bonne, et surmontée dun col couleur moka, dense, riche et crémeux, qui se réduit tranquillement en collant littéralement sur les parois du verre. Arômes de malt torréfié, beaucoup de chocolat, du chocolat noir, mais également du chocolat au lait et du cacao. On note également certains effluves de café léger, de levure terreuse, et dun houblon plutôt floral, avec un agréable parfum de vanille. Nez très intéressant, intensité et complexité adéquates. En bouche, ce nest pas tellement pétillant ou mousseux, onctuosité moyenne au palais. Au goût, le chocolat domine, autant le chocolat noir que le chocolat au lait et le cacao, et on a un peu de levure terreuse et dalcool, ainsi quune bonne dose de houblon floral. La vanille semble rester tranquillement en arrière-plan, quoique parfois elle semble ressortir davantage. À vrai dire, jai goûté à plusieurs reprises à cette bière (toujours en bouteille), et la vanille ma semblé parfois bien présente, le plus souvent plutôt subtile, et dautres fois carrément difficile à discerner. Contrairement à ce quon aurait pu penser, cette bière nest que très peu sucrée, présentant plutôt une amertume bien franche de faible à modérée. Les différentes saveurs sont bien intégrées les unes aux autres, bonne intensité en bouche, complexité qui laisse un peu à désirer cependant, très bonne bière néanmoins. [Note : Jai laissé vieillir en cellier une bouteille pendant 1 an, le résultat en a été plutôt décevant. La bière est beaucoup moins intense, des flaveurs de levure à pain, de caramel et de mélasse ont pris le dessus sur les chocolats et le houblon qui se sont grandement atténués, alors que la vanille est devenue presque inexistante. Je recommande donc de consommer cette bière la plus jeune possible. Il paraît quen fût directement au brouepub, elle na pas son égale]","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","pumpkinhead2"

451,"2013-01-13",3.0,"Pours a pitch black with huge creamy head that lasts forever. Nice lacing. 

Aroma - mostly yeasty notes and some burnt malt.

Tastes a little more complex than the nose, yeasty estery notes followed by cocoa powder, then burnt malts.  No hops of note.  Couldn't really pick up the vanilla notes.

Body is medium-full.  Good texture, creamy and smooth.  A little lingering aftertaste of the burnt malts. 

Overall it's a good effort, but a little disappointing.  I had high expectations and expected a little more complexity.

451,"2013-01-06",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2013 No bottling information.
Appearance: This is a good looking stout, I love mine pitch black and this fits the bill. The head is creamy, but thin and brown and has poor retention. It dissolves into a rather thick ring.
Aroma: The first thin that comes to mind is molasses with a light milk chocolate and perhaps a light vanilla. I have no idea how old this is thanks to Dieu du Ciel not dating American bottles.
Taste: The intro is interesting, its hard to discern perhaps a hint of molasses that leads to a vanilla and cocoa mid-taste that leans sweet from the vanilla as the cocoa is somewhere in between and cuts through the sweetness nicely. The finish is dry and lingers of roasted coffee.
Palate: The body is thin to medium bodied with a light carbonation presence.
Overall: This is a good stout, but Im glad this is possibly a bit aged as the vanilla seems like it may have been cloying fresh. This is a bit expensive in the US as well so it loses points there. Its a good stout, but I wont buy it again.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Mostly tastes of strong cocoa and sweet vanilla, with an aftertaste of sweet moka. Leaves a pleasant, lingering taste of strong, dark chocolate for a few minutes after the last sip. Has an oily texture and good carbonation. The alcohol tastes a bit, but just enough so that it is in no way irritating.

Appearance:
Dark brown to black with a minimal head. When held up to the light, you can get a bit of red to shine through the middle.

Black w thin lightbrown head. Sweet aroma of chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, excellent and long-lasting. Strong taste of vanilla, cocoa, some coconut, roasted malt, some sweetness and slight bitterness. Medium body w creamy, soft carbonation, could be fuller for my liking. Overall very balanced, great beer. if you like vanilla and cocoa, this is for you. I like it and would definitely drink again. It might become a bit much after a while however so I would suggest sharing the bottle.","SWEDEN","ejay"

the taste starts off with a coffee and vanilla. some roasted malts in the back ground but the two dueling flavors or te coffee and vanilla. Almost turns in it into a latteesc flavor.

451,"2011-04-23",3.5,"11.5 bottle (under the title ""Aphrodite""). A well balanced stout here, that is fairly straightforward and bittersweet. Poured with a light layer of wispy tan head that does not dissipate, the body is medium thick appearing, and dark chocolate brown in color. The nose is on the weaker side. Some airy, cocoa powder, toffee, earth, and vanilla almond cookies. In the feel, mostly creamy, some soft carbonation, and decently balanced. The flavor notes dont come together as well as I was expecting. The vanilla adds a nice quality to this one through the middle, but the cocoa makes things a bit too bittersweet with a candy bar-like quality coming through.

451,"2011-03-01",4.8,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle (with cool artwork) into a tulip glass. Info on the label includes its abv (6.5%) and a nice description of the beer.

Appearance: Its body has a very dark brown burnt wood color which only allows light to seek through at the edges. The pour produces a tall and thick chocolate milkshake like head. This tall head slowly settles to a thin tightly packed cap of foam that makes lots of lacing on the glass.

Smell: The aroma is deep and full bready yeast notes, toasted grain, powdery cocoa, wet leaves and damp earth.

Taste/Palate: Its medium to full body has good mix of roasted malt sweetness with hint of bitterness from both roasted malt and hops. Up first are chocolaty cocoa powder notes on top of toasted bready grain and earthy yeast with the slightest wet old woody presence. In the middle I pick up light vanilla bean notes as well as a light cream soda like flavor notes. This moves into the finish which adds dark roasted coffee and earth leafy hop bitterness.

451,"2010-11-29",4.2,"Reviewed on the same night as the Peche Mortal and preferred this. Like Peche Mortal has additives in this case cocao and vanilla as opposed to coffee. Unlike the Peche Mortal which is a bit too dominated by the coffee flavour for me, the cocao and vanilla balance each other out very well. A stout with a roasty taste, a sweetness from the vanilla which is balanced by the bitterness of the cocao. The result is a thick, dark stout that is nevertheless very drinkable.","Quebec, CANADA","UM02"

You can definitely smell and taste the chocolate but this is no where near as chocolaty as Youngs of Southern Tiers chocolate stouts!

451,"2010-09-03",3.7,"My advice to homebrewers who wish to brew chocolate beers is always to add some vanilla. The richness the vanilla imparts in this beer is exactly why. It emphasizes the chocolate flavors just like it does in chocolate cake and the like. The color here is brown, nearly black w/ only a very small bit of tan bubbles around the rim. The nose is of rich chocolate desserts, big time cocoa w/ a solid push of vanilla to back it up. This really is a wonderful balancing act by Dieu du Ciel. Its just sweet enough to bring out the chocolate and only bitter enough to balance the sweetness. I might complain that this is maybe a little thinner than Id think ideal, perhaps on account of just a hair too much carbonation, but that is really minor as the richness of the well done chocolate vanilla combo more than makes up for it. Most beers that seem to fill the dessert niche are things that youd only want to drink a small amount of but this is a very welcome exception.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

451,"2010-06-15",3.8,"A steady pour into my New Belgium much produces a huge dense foamy head that is a nicely browned rich, creamed cocoa color.  The beer is a solid black color that shows some brown notes around its edges.  Huge dark cocoa aromatics couple with aromas of darkly roasted coffee.  The chocolate character is really quite decadent smelling here and is accompanied, or perhaps accentuated by a dark sweetness.  If you really inspect the nose, ample toasted grain notes become noticeable towards the end: toasted, almost burn whole wheat cracker aromas, and rich browned bread crust aromatics become noticeable as does the Stout like roast malt aromas.  I have just realized, after taking my first sip, that the sweetness that I am smelling is is actually vanilla; it is funny how the brain does that, associating vanilla with sweetness because that is usually were one encounters it.

My first sip has me noticing just enough sweetness to accentuate a big dark chocolate note, but the beer ends up finishing quite dry with a bitter cocoa and roast malt character; hops definitely play there part in the bitterness but it is the roasted bitterness that seems to be the more noticed up front.  The vanilla flavors, and aromas for that matter, seemed to be missing, but then I realized the sweetness I had smelled and tasted really wasnt sweetness, but was instead the vanilla notes contributing a perceived sweetness to this beer.  Rich and somewhat viscous feeling on the tongue somehow, despite actually being fairly light bodied for something labeled as vanilla-chocolate stout; really though this is quite rich considering that this is not really malty-sweet.  Some of the roast grain astringency, couples with the dark malt and the vanilla to even contribute a hint of induced Bourbon-barrel flavors.

This is quite a nice beer; rich and satiating without being heavy and the complexity that the vanilla and chocolate brings to the beer is quite appreciated.  My only complaint is that the cocoa / roast bitterness can be a bit too much at times, though the beer definitely needs some of this to balance the up front rich chocolate and pervasive, though restrained vanilla notes.  I could easily drink a lot of this beer if my wallet could afford it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
451,"2010-06-12",4.7,"Appearance  Darks as night, unfiltered stout. No light is getting through. The light brown, Khaki colored  head is about fingers and fades fairly quickly leaving a nice lacing. 

Aroma  There is a very present soft vanilla bean aroma that falls to the background of the huge, chocolately malt smell. Theres a huge dark chocolate aroma from the cocoa and chocolate malt. It reminds of brewing up my own oatmeal stout. No hop aroma as is traditional with stouts. 

Taste  The vanilla been is definitely present but no overwhelming  blends amazingly with the rest of flavors. Nothing worse than vanilla as a dominating flavor in a beer. The bitterness is probably a combination of the chocolate and hops and reminds of eating very high percent cocoa dark chocolate. A real solid dark malt flavor backs up the cocoa and vanilla and lingers around. The mouth feel is lighter than expected but very pleasant and as it warms up the flavors intensify and the hops start to make their presence. Carbonation is spot on for the style.

Verdict  Although I enjoy beers like this at any time of the day, Aphrodite would make an excellent desert beer. Its a very balanced beer considering the adjuncts used with the stout base.","Vista, California, USA","rcubed"

An aggressive pour yielded an opaque black with a huge mocha-colored head which never completely dissapated.  Lacing is lasting as well.  Nose is not overwhelming - chocolate and vanilla prevail with some traces of roasted malt.  Taste is chocolate, vanilla a bready malt flavor and a nice semi-bitter finish with a little alcohol warming.  Very creamy and not overly thick mouthfeel.  Good carbonation.

Great taste of roasted malt with the coffee really present in the finish. The vanilla comes out in the aftertaste as the bitter coffee continues on.

Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a mineral mouthfeel.  Somewhat watered down feeling on the palate.  Bitter.  This starts off promising enough but falls kind of flat; disappointing.

Taste is much of the same, smooth and sweet. A noticeable sweet alcohol that has a rum butter like taste turns bitter and ash like in the back of the throat.

Flavor jumps with character from the get-go, with noticeable bourbon vanilla, cacao nibs, and salted toffee coming through. Dense and with clean brown sugars and a long lay of roast on the palate afterwards.

451,"2010-02-27",3.9,"Pours black with a small brown head. Aroma of deep cocoa. Flavor is roasted malts, some chocolate, a little vanilla on the tail end. The beer is pretty complex despite its unexpected lighter flavor. Starts sweet and then has a little bit of a bitter finish. Very smooth and clean on the palate. This is good but I was expecting stronger flavors.","Hagerstown, Maryland, USA","Nimrod979"

Not bad, but not worth all the hype its gotten, nor its price tag. Peche is far and away the superior stout they brew.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
451,"2010-02-26",3.6,"Bottle from Bruisin. Pours a rich dark near-black with ruby tints and a ring of a tan head. The aroma has lots of vanilla and chocolate, it seems a little sharp. The palate is fairly creamy but has some tickling carbonation. Lots of vanilla bean and chocolate flavor are very apparent. I never really got into the use of vanilla in beers. This is fair but it doesnt exactly float my boat. Its too much like a vanilla dessert for me. That being said, it isnt bad. Ive got no problem drinking a bottle every now and then. Pretty good stout, but nowhere near the awesomeness of their Peche Mortel.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
451,"2010-02-23",3.6,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a clear dark brown body with a small fizzy brown head that faded to a wispy film and a thick ring.  Great deep nose full of roast, milk chocolate, vanilla beans, some earthy yeast.  Amazingly rich cocoa notes.  The flavor is not nearly as deep and rich as the aroma would lead on.  The vanilla and cocoa are still pretty nice, but the malt depth just isnt doing everything that it should be doing for me.  I think that it just doesnt all meld well.  The lingering vanilla note comes across a bit extract like on the finish. I like the sweet and bitter balance thats going on here though.   Medium bodied with a fairly nice slightly chewy texture and soft carbonation.  Its probably a shame that this beer is lumped in with the original version cause it seems a long way away from a ""Top 50"" caliber beer.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Light bourbon.  The aroma is very much an aphrodisiac.  Sex in a bottle.  The flavor is super sweet vanilla bean ice cream, dry cocoa powder, powdered malted barley, and a bit of charred wood on the finish.  The palate actually works and is clean and non-sticky.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was an opaque black in the glass with red highlights at the very edge and an average tan to light brown head that kept a thin sheet and left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy roasted, milk chocolate and cocoa malts; and vanilla. The initial flavor was sweet, lightly bitter and acidic; while the finish was bitter, rather acidic and sweet with a long duration. There was vanilla, cocoa, coffee, bitter chocolate and roasted malt.

451,"2010-02-07",4.0,"If this was affordable, itd be a staple for me.  Its about as close too the edge of beer as you can get without  forgetting your drinking a beer.  The aroma is full of caramel, chocolate, coffee, espresso, and roasted malts.  The hobs are muted.  The adjuncts give everything from alcohol to banana, licorice, vanilla, and smoke.  The appearance is the only issue of concern here it is dark opaque black body with mininimal brass colored thin collar  The beer looks exactly like an espresso.  The taste is amazing, cocoa powder, chocolate dark and light, espresso.  All of which is perfectly balanced.  The beer is so smooth.  Its right on the edge of what you imagine beer can be.  It portends to be a beer, but really is so much closer in taste and action to a great chocolate elixir.  I imagine this is a close approximation to the old Aztec chocolate alcohol drink.  The beers body is not as full as you would imagine, its extremely creamy, but finds a way to finish slick and clean.  The carbonation is soft.  The beer makes you think it will be bitter, but it dims the moment before you ever get that astringent coffee or espresso finish.  Amazing beer.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

451,"2010-01-27",4.1,"Bottle labeled as Aphrodite.  This on is one of my longest sought brews.  The body is extremely dark, virtually black in fact.  A two finger head of light brown foam is decently retained, leaving drippy, sheety rings of lacing on the glass.  The nose is very roasty, featuring bakers chocolate and dark coffee beans amidst secondary notes of burnt caramel, earth, and toasted cinnamon.  Flavors are a good deal more complex, and considerably more tasty than the nose lets on.  A baseline of rich dark and sweet lactic chocolates is kissed with fresh coffee roast, spicy cinnamon, and vanilla bean.  The balance is spot on, showing alternating waves of roast and sweetness.  This depth of chocolate taste is often attempted, but rarely achieved in a stout, and the spices prove to be perfect compliments.  Smooth and creamy, the palate is sweet, spicy, and light to moderately carbonated.  Dry cocoa roast lingers on the finish for a good while.

I have been looking forward to trying this ever since it hit the states a while ago.  Despite the hefty price tag I still wasted no time in getting a bottle which went straight to the front of the queue.  Now that I have tried it once I wish I had a second bottle to share with a few friends.  This is definitely a top notch stout and one worth tracking down.

Aroma / Appearance - The huge black cocoa head bobbed over an oily black body like sand over an oil slick.  Rich chocolate, coffee, and vanilla are the main players in a rich symphony of smell.  Heady with a strong presence this one does not back down at all.

Flavor / Palate - Warming with a dense creamy mouthfeel this is packed full of rich flavors.  Black coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla beans, and other malty aspects round out a complex experience.  The smoky finish reminds me of a log that has been left to burn in a fire pit until it is halfway gone and then cooled.  Even at the price tag required for these imports it is worth purchasing.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

I dont know how many times Ive written ""I dont like strong chocolate flavors in my beers,"" but this if any beer could convince me otherwise, this is the one.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"

451,"2010-01-15",4.1,"2006 bottle, I think.  Pours nearly black with an average, creamy, frothy, light tan head which is mostly diminishing but does leave lasting froth and tight, frothy lace.  The nose is a very pleasant sweetness with just enough other notes; toasted caramels, dark chocolate, sweet vanilla, dry milk chocolate cocoa powder, very restrained roast, lightly nutty nougat, and some sweet, dark breads.  Flavor is similar with more dry notes than expected; dark toast, light burnt caramels, lightly roasted wood, vanilla beans, bakers chocolate, and dry cocoa.  Palate is perfect for a nearly table strength stout; nearly lively, medium full, somewhat round and velvety with a touch of dryness.  The finish is average length, drying, and lightly bitter with cocoa powder, roasted wood, and bakers chocolate.  Maybe my favorite non-imperial stout and certainly is helped by a great balance.  The vanilla and cocoa created a nice sweet base but the stout-ish notes and the dryness of the cocoa created nice depth.  Perfect palate for this style, incredibly likable.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

451,"2010-01-12",4.3,"Chocolate beers are a seemingly fool-proof product. Really, whats not to like? Sometimes I feel Im doing my readers a disservice by rating the majority I try so highly, but each seems to be better than the next. In the case of Aphrodite the Montreal-based microbrewery Dieu Du Ciel has created a beer that absolutely lives up its reputation (ranked in the 100th percentile on ratebeer.com and graded an A overall on beeradvocate.com). While I wouldnt say its the best chocolate stout ever made, I do think its an absolutely outstanding beer for all the right reasons.

NOTE: This beer is also and better known as Aprhodisiaque or Aphrodisiac. It goes by the name of Aphrodite in the United States due to FDA regulations (or so Im told). 

APPEARANCE AND AROMA

Would it surprise you if I told you this beer pours to an opaque black body? While many stouts appear to be black they are actually dark ruby red, but Aphrodite does not have even the faintest trace of a red outline even when held up to direct light.

It forms a large, foamy, brown head which lasts throughout the life of the beer and leaves generous lacing on the glass. The aroma is surprisingly mild with a general malty scent, although chocolate is noticeable.

TASTE

Dieu Du Ciel describes Aphrodite as a cocoa and vanilla stout, which is already very intriguing before even tasting it. Sure there are plenty of stouts which describe themselves as chocolate but this beer intends to be a little more complex.

It was apparent to me from the first sip that was indeed true. The head itself is rich, sweet and chocolaty and once the beer itself hit me I was in love with it. Immediately my palate is saturated with a rich milk chocolate-like flavor followed by a lightly roasted malt finish. There is a distinct, but fairly mild bitterness in the aftertaste. Unlike a bakers chocolate aftertaste in other chocolate stouts this beer is noticeable sweeter  most likely due to the usage of vanilla bean in the recipe. 

Aphrodite is not, to my knowledge, oak-aged, but there is a distinct earthiness to the finish. This could be explained by the fact the brewery lists bourbon among the notable flavors to the palate. this taste becomes more noticeable as the beer warms and because this is not an imperial brew, its actually quite inviting.

DRINKABILITY

I never consider mouthfeel and drinkability all that important when it comes to beer-judging until I drink a beer as enjoyable as Aphrodite. Not only is the palate delicious, but the actual process of drinking it is a pleasure as well. For a carbonated beer this drinks like a nitrogen-charged brew with a thick, creamy texture and a velvety finish. In fact, its so tasty and so smooth it was a challenge for me to not slug it down.

At 6.5% ABV this is a perfectly-proportional beer. Its not trying to show off the way a lot of imperial stouts do, but its got the gusto the pedestrian, session stouts lack. Because this is indeed intended to be a dessert beer I think it works perfectly as a one-and-done serving (its like chocolate cake  one piece is great but you probably wouldnt want to eat many slices in a row, right?).

FINAL THOUGHTS

Thanks to the ever-growing craft beer industry, this great beer has finally been released to American markets. However, considering Dieu Du Ciels fairly small size I expect its distribution to be rather limited. I paid $6.29 for one 12oz bottle of Aphrodite, but it was well worth it. While that may seem pricey, trust me, youll know it was worth it if youre able to get it.

The flavor is nicely roasted malt, coffee with vanilla cream, chocolate, with some bitterness in the finish.  This turned out to be drier and not as sweet as the nose indicated.  I love the use of cocoa and vanilla bean with this beer; nothing too over the top.  Medium bodied and very smooth drinking.

Full-bodied, medium carbonated. What I really like about this one is how well the flavors compliment each other without trying to be imperial, extreme, or really overwhelming.

Aphrodite, unlike the picture on the bottle is the darkest of browns with a fluffy cocoa head and great aromas of cocoa, dark fruit and earth/peat. That said, the nose is disappointing when compared to the flavor. Rich chocolate is running wild in this one with a cream and vanilla smoothness. A bit of dark fruit is there as well, but this is fairly one-dimensional. Creamy chocolate with a smooth finish. The only thing is that it is an amazing one-dimensional beer. Worth the trouble and worth the wait.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

451,"2009-12-09",4.5,"(bottle - 341 ml) Dark black pour with a creamy tan head. Aroma is mild with a very nice cocoa and bitter roasted malt smell and the lightest touch of vanilla.

Outstanding.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"

Chocolate and vanilla meshed nicely in the aroma with smoked, roasted, cocoa malt character too.  Seemed heavier than the tame alcohol percent it contained.  Chocolate and smooth malt presence and a touch of coffee-like tones.  The vanilla shined through in the end.  Really simple, but wonderfully complex at the same time.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"

Not too thick while still being quite sticky though not that sweet... medium bodied, medium full mouthfeel, not as roasty as expected. somewhat dry finish, and a touch of lingering bitterness...

Sweet, silky, very chocolatey palate, with burnt malt bitterness and coffee and dark fruity elements as well. Sweet and rich, but balanced. God am I glad I can buy this in Alberta!

451,"2009-12-03",3.4,"Bottle. Deep dark inky beer with a wisp of a tan head. Nose was sweet milk chocolate and a nice roasted cocoa bitterness. Flavor was a little underwhelming, sweet chocolate again ni the front, a big slug of vanilla and a lightly btter coffee at the end. Finish is a little sticky, and more of the vanilla. It was good, but the nice roasty/bitter nose didnt play in the taste much. Had it - I think this would be a really nice one. As it is, a well done beer.","Littleton, Colorado, USA","alagnak"

451,"2009-12-02",4.2,"11.5oz bottle poured into an English Pint at 48°.  Color is a solid black with good carbonation and a small tight brown head.  Aroma of deep roasted malt and coffee with a sweet alcohol scent in the back.  Starting with a mellow full body it has a creamy mouth feel that goes down with a sharp little bite.  Finish comes in with mellow smoky coffee and a touch of cask wood then a sweetness of vanilla and dried fruit.  After taste is clean leaving a roasted bitterness behind.  This is a very good mellow stout with sweet accents.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"
451,"2009-12-02",4.3,"Just a stunner of a beer, and might have been my favorite of the evening.  Rarely do I find a beer with such a straight-up milk chocolate/fudgey aroma.  Huge notes of milk chocolate, like walking into a chocolate shop.  Vanilla notes are big too and just a smidge of roasted malts.  I could smell this one non-stop.  The flavor doesnt let up either.  Milk chocolate dominates the flavor, vanilla, some sweet coffee notes...wow.  I can honestly say that Ive never had a beer quite so effective at bringing the flavor of milk chocolate to a beer, and it being this fn good.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
451,"2009-12-01",3.8,"Pours a dark brown colour with reddish undertones and a large dissipating tan coloured head. I have a cold so the aroma might actually be better and/or different than I detected. Aroma of coffee beans, cocoa powder, and dark fruits. Weak flavour of coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate, and a slight vanilla extract flavour. Zero carbonation made the beer seem flat and the flavours were not very palatable. Adrian led me to believe this beer would be really good. It was....ehhhh.","Doylestown, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerapprentice"
451,"2009-11-30",4.6,"Appearance:  Pours a midnight brown that starts off with a luxurious fluffy tan head. The head subsides to a thin layer of froth for the remainder of the session. The beer leaves a nice coating with little fizzy bubbles as well.

Aroma:  Fresh cracked vanilla bean pod, subtle roast, chocolate and a little bit of spice tickling the nose as well.

Taste:  Dry, coffee like roast, spicy hops, vanilla bean and burnt sugar sweetness. The layer of coffee lingers well after the sip.

Mouthfeel:  Thick and perfectly carbonated.

Overall: What an amazing beer. Its super flavorful, smells fantastic and has the big body to back it all up. While I could see sipping on this, the vanilla is so inviting I find myself taking larger mouthfuls with this treat of a beer.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

Very tasty dessert beer would go great with a great chocolate cream pie.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
451,"2009-11-26",3.9,"341ml bottle poured into a tulip pint glass. Dark brown opaque body with a fluffy brown head. Not much lacing and okay head retention. The aroma is quite rich, with lots of milk chocolate and vanilla notes, with a touch of woodiness and some roastiness.
The taste starts out with a very intense roasted malt flavour, with overroasted coffee bean notes and a hint of dark chocolate. Medium body with some crisp carbonation. A bit acidic (which was not the case when I first had it). There is a serious amount of bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste, which ends in bitter chocolate and coffee notes. 

This is the second time Im having this beer, but Ive got to say I enjoyed it much more the first time. Its a full-flavoured, quality dry milk stout, but the roastiness is a bit over the top and there is not enough sweetness to balance it off.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","DenisLD"

Quite malty, with strong notes of dark chocolate and also notes of roasted grain, vanilla and a hint of coffee. The flavour is almost heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.

451,"2009-11-24",2.8,"Chestnut-hued black. Tight and creamy beige froth entices the senses with its superb retention. Generic nose of cola, nougat, plastic, cacao nibs, chocolate taffy, burnt malt hulls, unripe plums and faint smoke. Overwhelmingly vanilla-laden with a hint of bile. Carbonation is soft and snug. Initially brash with gritty roast yet replete with vanilla which, to a certain degree, resembles plastic. Roast-derived acidity echoes the vibrant dried-plum esters which quickly get pushed aside as the vanilla refuses to relent. Bitter chocolate and scratchy cocoa are buried within the oppressive vanilla. Pungent roasted-malt character exhibits nice depth as it deposits considerable tar and java notes on the palate, but is eventually bludgeoned by the vanilla beans. Vanilla is utterly overbearing to the point of becoming bitter and fatiguing after merely two gulps. Fairly chalky in the finish with a nauseating roasted-malt and bitter vanilla-bean discord. Unpleasant notes of cheap chocolate taffy and vanilla linger on the palate for what seems like an eternity. Decent enough, in terms of structure and the lack of glaring flaws, but certainly a blatant misuse of vanilla.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

451,"2009-11-24",3.8,"Dark brown with a beige small head that leaves a nice lid of lacings.

The smell is very mellow and round, yet characterful. Lots of chocolate and vanilla. Pleasant malts beneath. Not very complex, but the vanilla and chocolate combination is very pleasant.

The taste is on the sweet side with a foundation of mild roasted maltiness and huge amounts of vanilla and chocolate/cocoa/chocolate powder. The sweet flavors of vanilla and cocoa are very prominent and dominate the taste completely. Its almost reminiscent of a tasty milkshake. Just a hint of dark fruits and perhaps a hint of smoke as well. The finish is very mildly bitter with notes of nuts and chocolate. Unfortunately, I think the finish is a bit short.

Medium body with a creamy texture. Slightly too active carbonation.

A good one. Very smooth and round. Its sweet, but not overly so and the somewhat one-sided character works really well due to the well crafted composition.

451,"2009-11-22",4.6,"Pours out a black brew with a nicely formed dark brown cap that withers away too fast down to surface cover but leaves some sticky, spotty lacing. Amazing aroma - one that is line with my favorite smells out of a glass. Sweet but soft like the fur on kittens. The chocolate is exquisite like a melted stronger milk chocolate mixed with 50% cocoa: smooth, inviting, mild and creamy. The vanilla and bourbon are as one, highlighting the sweetness and chewy character. MIld coffee floats around but never ever becomes close to dominating the character, caramel and a hint of smoke or molases - I think... something here reminds me faintly of coconut - kinda like the inside of a Mounds chocolate bar. The taste is awesome: smooth and delicate, its like a glass full of chocolate with more obvious (than the aroma), however mellowed, coffee flavours. The bitterness that hits mid sip builds slowly but steadily into a very lengthy finish is very nice and has a notable medicinal quality. Vanilla and bourbon reign early to mid sip fading to promote the bitterness of the thick roasty toasty malts and chocolate. I think Im finding a hint of red berries on the nose now. Ha! The finish now is very coffee bitter flavour. Very smooth with excellent carbonation, this beer sticks to my mouth leaving an array of flavours behind to savour beyond the final mouth full. This is a wonderful brew - top of the totem pole.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

451,"2009-11-20",3.8,"33cl bottle. Pours pitch black with a medium-thin tan head that doesnt last long but leaves many streaks, spots, and swaths of lace on the glass. Aroma is full of vanilla and chocolate tootsie rolls - like vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. The flavor starts with vanilla and chocolate up-front followed by waves of roasted malt flavors, some toasty malts, and then another wave of dark chocolate with a touch of coffee. There is a soft ripe fruit ester quality towards mid-palate along with a gentle, balancing earthy hop bitterness. The finish is mildly hoppy/bitter with notes of chocolate, soft vanilla, and softer still coffee. The after taste is mocha and vanilla with a well-balanced blend of roasty bitter and sweet. The mouthfeel is tingly and well-carbonated (despite the minimal foam in the pour) with a rather full body and creamy texture. Overall, a very nice dessert beer. I think it might have just a hint too much vanilla, but it is enjoyable.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Big and milky, but crisp as well, with a chalky finish that managed to avoid being cloying.

451,"2009-11-02",4.2,"12 oz bottle courtesy of an extra from tytoanderso. Thanks, Tyler!! Pours a thicker deep black pour, opaque and dark, even around the edges, with a dark brown sizable head that dies to a decent level, laces well. Aromas are fresh vanilla beans heavy, sweeter chocolate, some lighter coffee, roasted malts with a touch of char. Sweeter, but still good bitterness, rich. Very very nice. Initial is medium bodied, throwing heavy vanilla beans, fresh vanilla-like Baskin Robbins scent and flavor, darker chocolate that is smoothed out and made creamy, a bit of bittering and coffee towards the back end as more roast shows up. Full and coats the palate well flavorwise, but lighter overall in body, which is actually pretty cool, instead of being a thick cloying stout this goes back very easy. Bitterness and vanilla linger and meld on the back of the palate, further into the brew.

Lovely roast/chocolate aroma. VERY pungent beer I must say. Slight smoke aroma as well; a very nuanced aroma. Wow, this stout is pretty damn good. Nice sweet chocolate flavor, then a heavy roast flavor with some smoke that leaves me feeling pretty damn good about my life. Chocolate/roast/smoke flavor is just great.

Thick beige head that settles quickly for the style. It leaves lots of webby lace. The color is nearly black. I cannot detect any light coming through.

The real cocoa comes through in the smell. Theres also coffee, which makes this a mocha aroma beer.

Surprisingly, the cocoa flavor exceeds my expectations based on the smell. Think Nestles quick added to a milk stout. Still, it is appealing. Vanilla is such a delicate spice, that I have not found it anywhere. The finish is coffee-ish but short lived. Solid body with a proper level of carbonation.

Standard stout appearance with an average head.   Looks good but not exceptional.   The aroma is a great example of what can be done with the roastiness in a stout.   Add some vanilla and chocolate, and you have sensory overload.   There is no denying the confectionary qualities here, and burnt sugar bounces smoothly off of chocolate cake, vanilla frosting, and a little salty licorice.   After anticipating a cupcake in the aroma, the flavor is actually pretty dry and has a solid roasty, dark chocolate bitterness in the finish, while still having a nice maltiness up front.   This is actually in the border of a completely quaffable stout that only pretends to be a dessert sipper.   The body is somewhere near the middle and seems about right for a 6.5% beer.

451,"2009-10-19",3.9,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Courtesy of oteyj.  Pours a mostly transparent, chocolately black color with tannic hues and a two finger head of fine bubbled, beige foam.  Rich chocolate-cocoa notes on top of a firm roast malt base.  The vanilla is noticeable, but plays more of a back-up role to the chocolate and roast.  Its kind of three dimensional in that way, chocolate, roast, vanilla - in that order.  No real hop or yeast characters present in the aroma, leaving a nice, clean impression.  Medium bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a somewhat thin, yet pleasing texture.  The flavors are more of the same from the nose - chocolate, roast, and vanilla, in order of strength.  Finishes clean and chocolately, with  a touch of milky sweetness.  Great flavors; my only complaint is the body doesnt really stand up to the richness of the flavors.

Tastes of roasted malts, tobacco, light wood, light chocolate, cocoa, tar, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon.  Medium body.  Syrupy, dry texture.  Average carbonation.  Roasted malt, tar, tobacco, and cocoa finish is dry.  8/4/8/4/15 = 3.9.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
451,"2009-10-12",4.1,"Aphrodite bottle. Pour is perfect for a stout, pitch black and full bodied, with a medium sized tan head. Aroma is mostly bitter chocolate, but with a foundation of roasty malts and espresso, and I fancy that I can smell a bit of the vanilla as well. Flavor seems a bit thin to me at first. Just a standard stout flavor. But the flavors begin to open up for me. I can taste coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and nuts. I believe the vanilla does more to mello all the flavors out than to add any flavor of its own. This is a very good and well balanced stout. Im glad I gave it a try. Plus the label is pretty cute.","Berkeley, California, USA","Aquilo"

451,"2009-10-10",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2011 Draft at SL, 6/2011 - Much more roasty, smoky/ash character that really bumped up my impression of this one and balanced things out. Hop presence seemed notable too, along with a more robust body / bite and mouthfeel. Bumping the numbers quite a bit from 2.2. Original rating: Bottle, Aphrodite. The pour is typical for a stout, dark brown-black, nice little head (perhaps not as big as many of its peers). The aroma was tons of vanilla and tapioca with a bit of cocoa underneath, light roast, sweet smelling. The flavor was overkill vanillla and tapioca, quite a disappointment actually, given all the hype this brew gets. Maybe this is one of those classic, ""It has never been the same since they started bottling it, blah, blah, blah,"" but this thing was way over-hyped and Im not that excited to have finally tried it. It wouldnt surprise me if they added sugar and vanilla extract to this batch. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and light. Sorry, DdC, normally love ya, but....","","User37895"

The flavor had much more of the vanilla bean than anything else, and that really wasnt a bad thing.. tasty cocoa was laced throughout, light chocolatey bitterness around.. finished with more fresh vanilla bean and cocoa.

Smells of chocolate syrup, french roast coffee, and a bit of Vanilla Coke.  Flavors meld well, the chocolate is less like a sweet syrupy version and more like hot cocoa powder, the vanilla creeps up at the end, and the coffee is understated, much more subtle than Peche Mortel.  Hops are barely evident, unlike the dark malts that provide the foundation for all other flavors.

451,"2009-10-02",4.0,"11.5 oz bottle as Aphrodite. Pours a mostly black body with a thin, dark brown head that whisps away quickly into a medium amount of delicate lacing. Aroma is soothing cocoa powder and sweet, dark milk chocolate hand in hand with an enticing vanilla bean. Just a hint of smoke and plum as well as a very light roasted malt giving off just a trace of acidity every few sniffs. Mostly a deeper, cocoa powdered milk laden aroma though. Dessert-like smooth, dark milky chocolate greets the tongue as a cocoa powder and sweet vanilla bean quickly follow. A light amount of coffee roast comes in keeping this sweet, milky dessert balanced. A hint of mild hops, a pruney bourbon, and a lightly burnt malt come in at the end before this dries with plenty of cocoa along with some dark chocolate, vanilla, and milk in a long aftertaste. The cocoa, more of the burnt roast, and a light bitterness from the finish stick out the most. Palate is full and very smooth with only a peep of carbonation. Overall, a very sweet, milky dessert beer with an enjoyable, lighter roast profile. Lots of cocoa standing out.

Thick medium body with the perfect balance of smooth silky chocolate maltiness, roasted coffee, burnt toast, subtle hops and bitter dark chocolate. This beer is very well balanced and complex with the sweet notes from the chocolate and vanilla bean perfectly balancing out the roasted coffee/espresso bean and burnt toast flavors. Slight alcohol warmth but otherwise the ABV is very well masked. None of these flavors overpower the other, instead they all bounce off of each other and Im picking up something different on each sip. This is one of the most well-balanced beers Ive ever had.

451,"2009-09-12",3.7,"11.2 oz bottle via trade with daknole, thanks bro. Pours a deep dark black with an ample foamy dark beige head. Aroma is subdued and not what I was expecting. What is there is a Tootsie Roll scented chocolate dominating most of the aroma with softer notes of vanilla extract and grains. Flavor is better then the aroma with a bit more vanilla coming through, chocolate, raostiness and coffee gronunds adding in the roasted burnt flavors. Medium bodied with rather strong bubbly carbonation. Just like Peche Mortle loses a lot from keg to bottle I have a feeling this one does as well. Gonna have to head back up to Montreal and get some of this one tap directly from the source. Still a very good beer regardless.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

Huge, overflowing sticky stout nose, malt with roast and light ash.  Light nutty swath.  Pitch pour with a dark brown soapy head.  Tastes like a really good dry stout, bone dry with comforting roast and ash, nothing brusque or rude, with light wood and nuts.  Touch of coffee and slightly more sticky chocolate, aftertaste is woody with cocoa nibs and a little burn, slight fruit but vanilla seems to be hidden.  Earthy smoke.

451,"2009-08-15",4.0,"12oz bottle courtesy of MrRetardedMonkey poured into a tulip.

Pours very dark out of the glass and sits black in the glass with no light coming through.  Theres a small tan head that fed by a stream of bubbles that I can see flowing up the side of the glass.

Man, this stuff smells great.  Very sweet with vanilla and chocolate coming through aggressively, especially the vanilla.  There is a dark roasted malt presence that balances the sweetness perfectly.

The flavor is much less sweet up front with a strong bitter chocolate blast up front with some burnt malts in the background.  The vanilla is less prevalent overall but does come up in the finish which offsets the bitterness from the chocolate.

The mouthfeel is excellent and pretty full bodied for a non-impy stout.  Soft carbonation and almost chalky/powdery from the semi-sweet chocolate...if that makes sense.

Another very solid stout from DDC though maybe a step below Peche Mortel (though I am partial to coffee).  The use of the vanilla is much more evident in the aroma, which is where this beer shines for me.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Had the pleasure of sampling this at the 7/9/2009 Pittsburgh RB tasting extravaganza (PGHRBEXT) at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. It will be a long time, if ever I see a spread of bottles like I did there. I am not good enough for the beers that were that we served! For example, how about this beer: aphrodisiaque, again I am not good enough to have had the chance to rate this beer.  Keep in mind I am a rookie and do not rate by style, I rate by how it tastes to me. Vanilla bean aroma with a hint of imp stout roastiness.  Big dark pour with a fading head.  Vanilla bean flavors override the session. Somewhat slight creamy carbonation sensations on the tongue. Dark & glass staining. Strongish impy stout personality, I cant believe this is just a stout here and not an imp stout. Lets chew on raw dried vanilla beans with a chaser of alky. Interesting beer tasting experience. Cannot taste much chocolate, but I do sense it is in there. Lingering strong bitter alky and vanilla imp stout finish.

Huge roasted malt flavors, with plenty of chocolate malt and slight caramel sweetness.

No light getting through. The aroma is very fine, sharp cocoa, chocolate/toffee malts, only a subtle hint of vanilla, but quite nice. Nice but not anything mind blowing. The flavour is not at all in line with the aroma, perfect roasty bitterness matched with dryness from the cocoa and sweet chocolate malts with more vanilla. Everything is blended perfectly well together. Awesome! But the palate is the best part, thick yet utterly smooth, it just slides down the throat elegantly. Aftertaste has a lot of astringency in it and almost a hint of rummy booze though its very fleeting. Lingering flavour of awesomeness. Liquid silk. This is probably the best balanced stout Ive ever had. Well, its not making me submit to myself sexually, nor anyone else around me, so the name is bit odd but this stout is almost perfect for what it is.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

After a few sips, Im getting this vanila aroma. Quite powerfull actually.... making me wonder why it was not present right after the pour. Taste is slight roasted malt, slight dark chocolate. I can barely fell the alcohol (a bit more at the end).

451,"2008-10-03",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2009 On tap, DDC.  Appearance is near black, with an attractively smooth tan head.  Aroma is of vanilla, cocoa, roasts, and some malt.  Flavor is a sublime mixture of vanilla, coffee, cream and roasts.  Mid-palate mellows the flavor notes allowing time for  proper contemplation.  All while introducing a touch of sweetness. The finish is slightly bitter, but firmly flavorful and roasty.  Overall, I was very impressed with Aphrodesiac, though I prefer St Ambroises Oatmeal Stout by a hair. 4.2.  3/11/09 revised:  more creamy, roasted, and natural in the vanilla flavor than I remember.

I then went to the pub on Friday night, where I expected to try it, but they didnt have it on tap and the server said she heard that they had sold out at the Mondial de la Biere.  Oh no!  But I went back to the festival the next morning when they opened, and they had gone to get another keg of it--from a new batch.  I think this was a fine beer but not overwhelming, and certainly for my tastes nowhere as good as Peche Mortale.  Beautiful cascade in the glass--it seemed to change colors even.  Really lovely additives; as others note, Dieu du Ciel are a master of subtle and restrained brewing.  The vanilla emphasized a nice nuttiness in particular, though it is quite roasted too.

June 2004. First trip to Mondial. 2 year old Peche Mortel on tap at the brewpub, Ciel Étoilé rocks my palate with some cool anise. Doing the festival on a budget thing with Radek. No Aphrodisiaque.<P>
March 2005. TheRoot takes his bachelor party on the road. DDC is our first stop of the night before heading off to places more known for the size of their jugs than the quality of their beer. Some guy proposed at Peel Pub. Thats classy and a half. No Aphrodisiaque.<P>
July 2005. Ratebeer Summer Gathering. 2 year old Quintessence in the bottle is simply awesome. Solstice dEte breaks through my preconceived notions. Fantastic day! No Aphrodisiaque.<P>
September 2005. Great Migration Tour heading east to grad school. I think this was the first time I ever shared a beer with my dad! Most of a bottle of Equinoxe du Printemps to myself, delicious. No Aphrodisiaque.<P>
May 2006. Summer move back to Ontario. Met up with Quevillion in the afternoon. Corne du Diable was new and quite nice. No Aphrodisiaque.<P>
October 2006. Peche Mortel at Cask Day in Toronto, Im in Halifax pondering the merits of flights home to no avail. No Aphrodisiaque, so at least theres that consolation.<P> 

December 2006. Driving the U-Haul from Halifax to Toronto. Stopped for the night in Montreal with a fellow Dal student. Cornemuse is a pleasant surprise. No Aphrodisiaque.<P>

October 2007. Cask Days. I blend Peche Mortel with Black Oaks Bourbon Barrel stout for sacrilicious new delight. No Aphrodisiaque.<P>

?? 2007. R offers to share a bottle but we need to leave before he can re-appear with the Aphrodisiaque. Cass ended up being the lucky recipient instead I think. No Aphrodisiaque.<P>

2008-05-30. Mondial 2008. I proceed directly to the Dieu du Ciel booth and request Aphrodisiaque. Success at last!!!! The servers eyes go bug-eyed when I comment that I have been waiting five years to try this beer. 

Pitch black body with a modest but delightfully creamy tan cafe au lait like head that swirls intriguingly. (4+) Served ludicrously cold it requires a few minutes to warm up enough to taste. Sweet aroma of vanilla beans that bring with them a light note of vegetation (not vegetal), mild roast malt undertones. (7+) Flavour has pleasant vanilla notes blended with mild roast, sweetish touch to the base of malt, light lingering bitterness to the finish. (7+) Smooth creamy medium palate could be more full bodied for my liking but is rather nice as is.  Very nice beer overall. The highest rated Canadian beer that I had not had yet, I was going to wait to make it #3000 but didnt want to risk missing it again! The inevitable question is whether it was worth waiting five years for, and the answer is no, but I doubt there is a beer that could possibily live up to that kind of anticipation!

Flavo ris a bit more intense and loaded with vanilla bean, velvety ligth milk chocolates, almost essence of chocolate- some vanilla- buttery oakiness as well with some light charry roastiness in the middle, then subsides and becomes very smooth and almost slick in the end.

451,"2006-10-02",4.3,"Dark brown color, with beige long lasting head and a lot of long lasting lace. The taste is of a rich mocha chocolat coffee. You can also taste some bitterness that just makes it even more inviting. The near perfect stout.","Ste-Therese, Quebec, CANADA","LadySusan"

451,"2006-09-19",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2006 Draught (nitro, I asked).  at the bar in heaven, I mean Dieu du Ciel.  Very deep ruby, clear, with a large, lasting, creamy beige head.  Rich, sweet-yet-bitter aroma of strong mocha coffee, some hazelnut, with sweet light roast malt, chocolate, yeast and milk solids.  Solid creamy mocha flavour, lots of hop bitterness, nowhere near as sweet as I expected it to be, only a small vanilla bean tang to it, has a long rich balanced finish.  Mouthfeel - Lord this is a nice beer, felt perfect on my palate, thick, sweet, lightly carbonated, just a hint of acidity, with a long finish.  Terrific sweet stout.

Plate dominated by soft textures, roasted grain and soft bitterness of raw cacao. Munich malts were used as well? Light yet very rich. Impression of chocolate dipped drink. Very good for chocolate lovers in cold fall nights.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"

I also smoke to the owner, and they are really sympatic.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","unibrouefan"
451,"2006-06-06",4.5,"Amazing!  Dark brown with a tan head that just floats on the body.  Aroma was spectacular with vanilla, milk chocolate, coffee and some brown sugar.  Flavour starts with a kick of vanilla coffee and then moves to the choclate before creaming at the finish.  Tastes like the best coffee, vanilla cream and chocolate mixed together.  My favourite from Mondial 06.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","BeerPrince"
451,"2006-06-05",4.4,"Easily the best nitro beer I have ever had. On tap at the brewpub. The body was very dark brown almost black. The light khaki head was frothy.

Very good.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

451,"2006-05-06",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2008 Bottle (12/2005) 6.5% ABV... Shared with Dutch70 and Jean-François at the brewpub... This beer rocks!... Black in the glass; opaque caramel color when held up to bright light. Large, creamy, khaki head. Good retention. The aroma delivers big notes of milk chocolate, medium notes of vanilla beans and coffee... subtle notes of brown sugar and toasted walnuts. Slightly sweet flavor with rich chocolate,  vanilla and light caramel. Medium-bodied and velvety with mild carbonation. Finishes chocolatey, lightly burnt/bitter and dry. Thanks to Jean-François for the bottle. I see no reason why this wouldnt be a hit when kegged, bottled and exported to the U.S. I look forward to the day when I can try it on nitro as intended.

451,"2005-12-20",4.4,"draught. the pour is a lush pitch black with a long-lasting, thick, creamy, mocha head. well I have to say that the aroma isnt entirely complex but it does have its moments - creamy roast malt with faint espresso and chocolate. but upon first sip it really opens up! wow, that is some effin body - it couldnt possibly be smoother. the vanilla is so rich and flavourful...I cant remember ever having a stout brewed with vanilla and it certainly wasnt as smooth and balanced as this. in the background you have soft milk chocolate blending beautifully. the finish has a delicate chocolate bitterness with a faint roastiness. at this point I had been drinking for eight minutes and there was still a significantly sized head. the great thing about this, like others have mentioned, is that its only 5% so you could easily down a few of these. truly an awesome beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"

451,"2005-09-10",4.0,"tap at the brewpub, 8/9 with goldorak, smells of sweet vanilla, milk chocolate, and lots of roast.  the pour was jet black with a creamy nitrous head. i was expecting more pronounced cream and cocoa flavors.  dont get me wrong, they were there, but they were a bit muted behind just the plain roasted malt flavor. body was also a little thin, especially considering this was on nitro.  it didnt coat the inside of my mouth the way some other stouts do, but it did leave a very sweet chocolate taste behind.  i enjoyed this beer alot, enough to have another glas before i left, but imo, it doesnt come close to Peche Mortel, and i actually like the Grande Noirceur more in terms of body and mouthfeel.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"

This beer is black with a white, Guinnessy head that comes from nitrogen--looks very nice.  Aroma is creamy cream with some vanilla, leading into dark malt notes: chocolate and bubblegum (yeah, I sometimes get that out of dark malts).  Flavour is very impressive (more so than the aroma): Begins with vanilla with some nutmeg and bourbon notes leading into chocolate and finally some malt bitterness.  Dry and clean with little indication that hops were included in this beer.  Light body and clean; delicate.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"
451,"2005-08-01",4.3,"This tap version clocked in at 6.0% ABV.
Not a single ray of light would pass through the blackness of this Beer, adorned with a dense cream that clung dearly on the sides of my pint.
Cocoa powder aroma, like the kind they sprinkle on a mochachino, vanilla wasnt as strong as the last time Ive had it, but thats a good thing because too much vanilla can be quite cloying.  Boozy vapors offer a faint piquant but it was barely distinguishable.
The short version of the flavor description would be to say that this brew tastes like a chocolate crème brulée.  Dark chocolate, and Id be surprised if he didnt use real vanilla bean, if so he used a really high quality extract.  Almost no bitterness at all, it was so silken it felt like cream.  The only thing wrong I could find was that it the aftertaste was a bit chalky towards the end, it sort of creeped up along with the alcohol effluvia.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

Pours a very deep dark opaque black with a creamy brown head.  Aroma is big chocolate, vanilla and marshmellow sweet...wow.   I figured Id like it, but wow.   The taste is delicious vanilla, cocoa, and a restrained bitterness.  Finishes with a vanilla flavour so smooth and bittersweet that I was sad to reach the end.  Surprisingly awesome.

451,"2005-03-04",4.7,"On draught 2/25/05 at the Moan and Dove, Péché Mortel release party. Served in a tumbler between 47-52 degrees.Having heard some things about this batch that made me less than excited to try this, I was blown away when I took my first sip.  I did one of those things where you immediately exclaim ""Holy Shit this is good!"" and proceed to drink the rest of your glass too fast, greedily drinking the wonderful liquid.  So I took it a little more slowly on the second sample.Aroma smells of sticky, sweet milk chocolate, chewy toffee and even some marshmallows (kind of like a Smore), must be the interplay of vanilla, malt and chocolate.  Light notes of roast grace the nose as well.  As good as the aroma is, the flavor is what elicited the above reaction out of me.  Sticky, chewy chocolate, sweet malt, light roast for balance and lovely liquified vanilla iced-cream flavors cover the palate.  FULL body, but not syrupy, fatiguing or cloying.  I was in sheer disbelief when told this was only five percent alcohol.  Not that I tasted any alcohol in it, but it is just hard to believe that a beer of this thickness and full flavor has such a moderate alcohol content.  Brownish-black body with a creamy, light-tan head.  A real show-stopper.  Writing this review makes me yearn for another taste. . . . .","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
451,"2005-02-26",4.8,"Tap.  Moan and Dove Peche Mortel unveiling.  To be quite honest, this beer stole the show.  This beer showed up the Peche Mortel, which is not an easy feat.  Gorgeous sweet sugary vanilla aroma with hints of chocolate.  This thing smells amazing.  Yummy.  Pitch black with a long-standing light tan head.  The head is much more durable than the Peche Mortel.  Sweet, chocolatey, vanilla notes.  Roasts are present as well.  Flavor of a roasted chocolate milk with a twist of vanilla.  No alcohol detected.  This is extremely satisfying and perhaps the best beer I have ever experienced.  Great mouthfeel, silky, and amazingly drinkable.
