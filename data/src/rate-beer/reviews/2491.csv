Wysycenie niskie, lekko cierpkie, półpełne w odbiorze.

Aromat: cudowny i orzeźwiający aromat amerykańskich chmieli (ananas, mango, cytrusy, kwiaty). Jest tak silny, że trudno przy nim wyłowić słód (może lekkie melanoidyny), natomiast wyczuwalny powoli staje się alkohol. Profil jest czysty bez obecności estrów. 

Smak: wyraźna słodowa słodycz, szybko skontrowana chmielem. Na finiszu spieczona skórka od chleba oraz wyraźny alkohol. Balans w kierunku chmielu, ale sprawdza to się doskonale. 

Goryczka i odczucie w ustach: dosyć wysoka, owocowa goryczka, lekko drażniąca i długa, ale nie zalegająca. Krągła pełnia, dodatkowo wzmacniana przez względnie wysokie nasycenie. Wytrawna oraz alkoholowa, rozgrzewająca przełyk końcówka. 

Następne piwo, które zakupiłem dość przypadkowo, chcąc osiągnąć wartość zamówienia potrzebną na darmową wysyłkę. Jest to imperialny lager o czystym profilu, solidne chmielony trzema amerykańskimi odmianami. Zaskakują w nim przede wszystkim opakowanie (zapożyczona z piw belgijskich forma butelki owiniętej w papier) oraz dość głęboka barwa. W obu przypadkach są to jednak decyzje trafione. O ile podobne piwo z Mikkellera wypiłem z trudem, to tutaj musiałem się powstrzymywać żeby nie wychylić go w kilku większych haustach. Zaczynam się zatem zastanawiać czy solidnie chmielony lager nie jest lepszą alternatywą od IPA?

NOS : piwo ma mocny aromat chmieli o nutach cytrusów, ziół, owoców tropikalnych i żywicy. Mocny jest również aromat spodu od ciasta, zbrązowiałego tosta i karmelu. Do tego alkohol pachnie jak bourbon i rozpuszczalnik. Wyczuwam również wanilie i delikatnie goździki. 

USTA : piwo ma umiarkowane nasycenie, jest tłuste o konsystencji mleka. 
Piwo jest całkiem słodkie o wyraźnych nutach słodowych podobnych do wyżej wymienionych aromatów tosta i spodu ciasta. Alkohol rozgrzewa a całość mocno atakuje kubki smakowe. Chmielenie jest mocne, gdzie żywiczność podkreśla alkohol i gorzkość. Gorzkość przypomina grejpfruta i przypalony tost. 

ODCZUCIA : jest to świetne piwo. Całkiem pijalne jak na tyle procent alkoholu. Przyjemne i gładkie do tego świetnie zbalansowane. Warte spróbowania.
