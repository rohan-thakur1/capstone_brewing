488,"2017-06-21",3.7,"Bottle from VE. Nose stale and slightly nutty coffee. Pour deep, dark, sludgy brown right from the start, so obvious motor oil in the glass, head is tight, dark brown. Body only medium in fullness, sludgy-smooth and thick; medium sweet with bursting sweet fruit (raisin, plum, cherry, berry) mixed with sugar; strong but very smooth and well-integrated alcohol with no rough patches; coffee is milder and one of the complementary shades. Not much roast or scorch, but there is nice chocolate, if at a low level, with subtle spikes of molasses but no cocoa. Hint of cream but no vanilla or bitterness.  Gooey but not milky, nicely beany, and has the feeling of something quite concentrated thats to be diluted later with water - truly spoonable. A big winner on secondary characteristics, but boy are those enough to carry it! [2017.06.21: 3.7]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

488,"2017-01-13",4.2,"12 ounce bottle, stamp on the label says 10/31/16. Im assuming thats the bottled on date since Shorts website says this brew was a November 2016 release. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a while. Theres also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like coffee, cream, roasted malt and some chocolate. I think the taste pretty much follows the aroma, its all coffee, cream, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. I think its more bitter than sweet, and thats fine with me! Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy and coating with a good amount of carbonation.

488,"2015-06-19",3.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a very dark brown with almost no head and no lacing. Not quite fully opaque. Light comes through on the edges, but not through the body of the liquid. Looks thin, really. Strong coffee flavor. Almost smells like an over-brewed, burnt roast. Another review mentioned Starbucks coffee, probably for this reason. Roasted malts come through, but its faint by comparison to the coffee. Similar flavor. The coffee isnt as pronounced as it is in the nose. Its still strong, but it tastes more like a stout than just a cup of coffee. A lot of lactose sweetness comes through in the back and diminishes any bitterness. Very thin. Fairly low carbonation, but its not too low. Its an appropriate level. The body is what lets it down. I want something a bit chewier to stand up to the coffee. It doesnt taste like an 8% beer though. I would expect something with such little body to be a lot boozier at 8%, but it isnt. Certainly tasty and pretty easy to drink, since its so thin. The lactose and intensity of the coffee are a turn-off, though.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

488,"2015-01-10",4.5,"2014 bottle. Pours dark brown, near black, with a 2 finger mocha head that slowly recedes to a nice cap over the beer. Aromas are loaded with fresh coffee grounds, cocoa powder, chocolate mousse, vanilla and lightly roasted almonds. Taste is packed with coffee, espresso, Irish creme and cocoa. Great counterbalance between the sweet creamy mouthfeel and the dry cocoa. Really compliments each other. Nice chocolate notes shine through this beer...never getting too chewy with the medium carbonation helping push the flavors. A nice moderate coffee bitterness spikes the finish as it lingers with some Herseys Kiss milk chocolate goodness. Shorts really raised the bar with this years version.

488,"2014-05-14",4.3,"Tap: 32 oz mug of coffee stout. Dark, dark, dark as hell; frothy, latte-looking tan foam on top of this abyss. Insane coffee aroma... Smells like a morning cup of coffee with cream & sugar, perhaps a flavor shot of vanilla. Thick & creamy sweetness with a gentle roasted quality; hints of dry cocoa, charred wood, & toasted barley round out the back-end. Very enticing. Columbian coffee flavor profile, again, with definitive (but not excessive) amounts of lactose creaminess & sweetness, just like an amped up cup of Joe. Mild woodiness, hint of nuts, & notable vanilla, likely from the lactose addition. Sweet up front, but leaves your palate lingering with a final touch of roasted bitterness & dark coffee bean flavor. Your palate screams for more... Coffee & beer lovers rejoice, our juxtaposition has arrived. People bust wads over Founders Breakfast Stout (which is great, dont get me wrong), but in my opinion, THIS is the Michigan coffee stout that I crave year in & year out.

I found a new Shorts favorite.

Appearance: Pitch black. Little head on it that goes away pretty quickly. Nice lacing at the top, but not much at the end. Looks... well... stouty.

Smell: Ugh. Good Lord. So much coffee... fully loaded with it. Roast. Maybe notes of chocolate. The coffee dominates and permeates all around.

Taste/feel: Like the smell, but the feel puts it to another level -- perfectly silky and creamy and way too drinkable. The coffee is at the forefront, of course, with a bit of chocolate sweetness. A touch bitter, but well balanced as a whole. If you love coffee in your stouts, youll fall in love with this as I have.

An utterly incredible beer worthy of a pick up. The rating is among Shorts highest for a reason... I thought their Mystery Oatmeal Stout was awesome, but this is actually a little bit better. Dont bother putting socks on before trying this beer, because itll knock them right off anyway.

488,"2013-06-04",4.2,"On tap, served in a pint glass at Slows.

My pour of Cup A Joe arrives without much visual fanfare.  The beer itself is very thick dark brown color, and there is just a little wisp of a light brown head.  

The coffee in the aroma hits my nose hard.  The Higher Grounds espresso provides a pleasant, earthy espresso tone with underlying notes of cocoa and tobacco.  Medium roasted malt, some dark chocolate, and sweet cream are also noticeable.

By no means is this a complex beer, but each sip is packed full of coffee, cream, and malt, as advertised.  The coffee used to make this beer is of good quality and provides a smoothness I would like in my coffee in the morning.  The cream adds a sweetness that cuts the bitterness from the coffee and accentuates the chocolate flavors more.  The roasted malt provides a nice backbone for the whole experience without really getting in the way.

The creamy nature of the mouthfeel really puts this mouthfeel over the top.  It is clear that the creme and the way this beer is made allow for such a luxurious and rich feel.  The carbonation is smooth, and a residual sweetness stays on the lips after each sip.

Living in Michigan definitely has its perks.  Being able to drink Shorts on tap is definitely one of them.  I would go so far as to say that this is one of the best 7% coffee stouts I have had.  However, the bottle I had was absolutely putrid.  It was not old but had clearly refermented into an undrinkable mess.

488,"2012-04-30",1.7,"Originally reviewed: 3/27/11. I had received a boxload of Shorts earlier this year and only 1/4 of what I had tried was not infected. I thought surely this beer, with its A- average, would be alright. I was anticipating it greatly, as coffee stouts are one of my favorites. Alas, it did not deliver. And because Shorts has horrible quality control and I am not alone in my experience with this , I will review nonetheless. 

Split this with my wife. Poured my allotment into a chalice. Pours a very dark black, with the thinnest of tan heads on top. No lace. The nose is the best part of this beer. With the other infected Shorts brews, I could sense it in the aroma, not with this one. This misled me into believing it was indeed an alright beer. Big notes of freshly-ground coffee, some chocolate, and roasted malts. What I expected and hoped for. 

The mouth is overly-carbonated for the style. I like a bit more smoothness and heft. This one was bordering spritzy and thin. Eh. The flavor is where this fell flat. Some coffee is notes, but it is so overpowered by sourness, that I cant even begin to pull out other flavors. Chocolate? Not so much. Sweet cream? Nope. Sour vinegar? Bingo! Thats it.

S: Bold, roasted coffee. Hints of expresso, bittersweet chocolate and a nice sweet cream undercurrent.

T: Much like the nose, this is definitely coffee forward. A nice earthy, smokey blend of roasted coffee pleases the palate. The chocolate and sweet cream help to balance the coffee and results in a surprisingly delicate experience considering the boldness of the roasted coffee in the nose.

M: Perhaps the biggest flaw is the weight of the body. While the lightness makes this beer incredibly drinkable, I was hoping for a creamier experience. Otherwise smooth, with a nice lingering finish of lightly bitter coffee.

Appearance:

Coffee and condensed milk. Slightly sweet. Its kind of like a a creamy iced coffee smell. No hop presence here.

Still, no noticeable hops, but no issues here. Lots of coffee, some creamy milkiness hanging around with it. Again, like a coffee with cream. Thats the best way to describe this. Semi sweet with some chocolate notes in the background too.

Mouthfeel: 
Thickish, more like the milk than the coffee. I suspect that lactose is an ingredient here. Mediumish carbonation.

4.5 S: Dark roast coffee up front. Malty sweetness next with lots of lactose. Roasted barley burtness and dark chocolate.

4.5 T: Surprisingly, there isnt much bitterness from the hops or the coffee. Rather, this is closer to the ""coffee creme stout"" they were going for. Medium roast coffee, mocha, sourish lactose sweetness makes this one quite tasty.

5.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good carbonation even though it originally appeared to be overcarbed. Very creamy, which I love.

A nice sweetness mixes in, balances well. Big on aroma and coffee. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a bit lighter, roasted and sweet, actually the sweetness takes over with lactose, chocolate, coffee grounds and roasty beans mix in.

Vanilla and cream, lactose sweetness and light cocoa. Highly rich aroma leads way to an easily quaffable sweet stout that tastes very close to an iced sweetened coffee with cream. Quite flavorful, but lighter end of medium bodied. Quite nice, lingering roast and cream, sweetness. Mmmmm. Amazing this weighs in at 8 ABV! Doesnt taste anything like it..","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

The aroma had hints of roasted coffee bean, espresso and vanilla, a delicious combo I could fall for every time. The flavor however was something totally out of left field. Black Olive.... Thats right, black olives came through in the flavor. I didnt catch it at first, probably because I dont eat olives ever, but once The Ferm mentioned it I totally tasted it. It was quite bizarre to say the least. It had the coffee and lactose flavors as well, but black olives really took center stage on this one. I might be inclined to get more of this, but I wouldnt go out of my way to be truthful.

488,"2011-01-03",4.0,"BIG thanks to Jim for this brew!

A- Body is an opaque thick dark brown-nearly black hue. Pours with a one finger or so dark brown soapy head that quickly fades to a thin collar. Little to no lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Very strong coffee with a lot of dark roasted malt being dominant in the nose-not completely black coffee as there is a semisweet essence milk (coffee creamer)

T-Taste is much more balanced than the nose. The milk sugar comes through initially with a really big roasted malt backbone. The finish is conistent with the initial flavor but slightly sweeter. A mild roasted malt bitterness lingers.

M- Low to medium carbonation and a fairly thick body that is smooth an creamy-well done.

D- This really comes across as a good imperial milk/coffee stout. The alcohol is very well hidden and this is a very tasty well done, tasty brew from shorts.

488,"2010-08-21",3.0,"A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a four-finger thick, richly brown colored head.  The beer is an almost perfectly black color and remains opaque even when held up directly to the light.  As I pour this beer the aroma of deeply roasted, almost acrid roast coffee is noticeable.  A more focused inspection of the nose yields some weird aromatic combinations.  Coffee definitely plays a big role here, but there seems to be a burnt vegetal edge to it.  Underneath this is some dark chocolate character with a touch of sweetness to it.  Roasted coffee joins roasted / toasted grain and there is even a hint of cherry character bound up in these roast notes.  A touch too acrid and burnt-vegetal like, but actually the nose isnt really that bad.

Lightly sweet up front and this beer has a definite body to it from the lactose sugar, but the beer also finishes with a big tartness that I at first thought might have been contributed by the burnt grain and coffee, but it is too much and is in fact lactic in character.  Unfortunately another infected brew from Shorts, again it sort of works here somehow.  I wont have any trouble finishing my bottle of this infected brew.  The lactic acid blends pretty harmoniously with the lactose and the big roasted coffee and grain character found here.  Both the roast character and the lactic acid compete with the lactose sweetness, such that the beer almost comes off as being dry.  Somehow the infection has added flavors of cherries to this beer as well.

This is another clearly infected brew that works better than it actually should.  Again, if you are open to the experience then give it a go, but if you are looking for a Coffee Crème Stout then look else-where.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

488,"2010-01-29",4.3,"12oz bottle shared by bring on BA - thanks, Barry!  While some of the Shorts beers did not impress, this one was awesome and then some.  Pours black like coffee with a large tan head and very nice lacing.  A crapload of fresh coffee jumps out at you in the aroma.  More potent and good-smelling than most coffee beers.  Some roasted malt and chocolate are also present.  Flavor is amazing - freshly brewed, rich mocha with cream.  The coffee flavor blends seamlessly with the rest of the beer, and the cream really starts to make its presence known as the beer sits for awhile.  Amazingly smooth and creamy on the palate with medium-full body and almost none of the harsh bitterness that other coffee beers can have.  I wouldnt mind drinking one of these every morning.  Unfortunately my job has an annoying ""no alcohol at work"" policy.  Lame.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
488,"2010-01-28",4.2,"Another Shorts beer courtesy of hoppymeal.

Pours pitch black out of the bottle, completely opaque with a big thick mocha head that refuses to die and sticks to glass stubbornly on the way down.

As a coffee beer lover, I might be a bit biased, but this thing smells fantastic.  Freshly ground coffee, sweet cream, dark roasted malts - just spot on for the style and completely fills the nose.

The taste isnt quite as heavenly as the nose, but its close.  The spent coffee grounds are still in full force along with the  big lactose sweetness.  Tastes like an iced latte.  The only complaint I have in the taste is its a tad too bitter but thats nitpicking.

The mouthfeel is probably what keeps this one from the pantheon of coffee beers in my mind.  Its just too carbonated for a stout in my opinion.

As a coffee beer lover, this one certainly hits the spot and if they ramped the carbonation down a little, this would be a world class beer.  As it stands, its just plain great!","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

A study into history and sociology. A pinnacle of creativity, imagination, and skill. A beacon of peace and brotherly love.


Imagine the quantity of coffee beans it requires to brew a batch of said-infused stout, and even Starbucks would be put to shame. I would never advocate irresponsibility or over-indulgence because too much of anything is never a good thing, but come some sunny morning, as the eggs are frying on the griddle and toast is warming in the oven, crack open that Cuppa Joe Java Cream Stout from Shorts Brewing and rediscover the pleasures of breakfast.


Rich, viscous, and blacker then freshly brewed coffee, my Cuppa Joe would light up anyones morning, though I happen to be enjoying him later in the evening. Very little head to speak of which quickly sinks into the looming darkness below. His nose is a beautiful one-two punch of dry and dark crumbly bitter chocolates as a river of coffee rips and roars through it all. Vanilla bean, licorice, wood, and fresh notes of cream are carried away like helpless victims. On nose alone I feel a ripple of energy and alertness start to spread throughout my being. Purportedly, Shorts Brewing used whole bags of coffee beans to create this veritable tome of stout and coffee heaven; I can believe it. A very clean and smooth mouthfeel which isnt at all heavy. Considering the weight of flavor, an additional weight of body would have served to bog down this easy quaffing pick-me-up. Skim milk, bitter dry dark chocolates, crunchy chocolate covered espresso beans, freshly brewed coffee and a gentle undercurrent of vanilla tinged wood washes over my tastebuds with joyous abandon. My palate starts to slowly dry as licorice, charred malts, and dry espresso grinds give the palate a brisk finish. Again, I am amazed at how clean and light the body is which makes my evening Cuppa Joe far too easy to drink.


As I wrap up my night, and yet another amazing tasting, I cant recall a single beer which didnt wow, dazzle, and mystify. One, maybe two were good and not great, but even good is better than a face-wrenching drain-pour any day. Shorts Brewing is a small brewery which offers some of their beers in growlers-to-go which is how I enjoyed their Cuppa Joe Java Cream Stout. I hope the frisky folks at Shorts arent brewing in only their shorts, but if that is what it takes to create magic, then Im ok with that.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

488,"2009-02-10",3.9,"Growler, courtesy GodOfThunder via northernbrews.  The body is virtually pitch black at the center with traces of mahogany at the far edges.  A small, foamy, mocha colored head crowns the surface.  Thin sheets of lacing slowly break apart and stick as scattered spots.  The aroma shows bold, fresh, darkly roasted coffee beans over a base of bittersweet dark chocolate and smooth, creamy mocha malts.  Earthy hops enhance the coffee roast, each working in unison to counter the underlying creamy chocolate sweetness.  Flavors are very much coffee forward, decadent roast hitting first, followed by robust bitter chocolate and notes of mocha cream.  Substantial and creamy, the body leaves lingering coffee flavors behind.  This stuff is as delicious as it is easy going.  I could probably kill the whole growler by myself in a days time.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
488,"2009-02-03",3.8,"Growler... GSRARO Throwdown... Pours pitch black with a small, creamy, light brown head. Leaves a tan, oily coating around the glass as it recedes. Smells like a blend of coffee grounds and milk chocolate  mocha. Full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel and lively carbonation. The flavor is chock full of chocolate and even heavier on the coffee grounds. A touch too sweet... the residual sugars far outlast any bitter, tannic notes. Sweet, mocha finish... more coffee-forward than chocolaty. Thanks to GodOfThunder for providing this beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
488,"2009-01-26",3.9,"Growler. My last beer at the throwdown. Big ass coffee nose, with touches of chocolate. Even bigger coffee flavor, semi-sweet thankfully, not the dry thin coffee palate of many coffee stouts.  Just alot of mocha chocolate coffee goodness.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
488,"2009-01-22",3.9,"Got the opportunity to try this beauty courtesy of Hoppymeal - thanks, Derek!!! As a fan of all things coffee and beer, its hard to resist this beer. Hefty pour with a creamy head that rises late from the oily body. Sumptuous aroma of bakers chocolate, dark roast, and moderate fruity scents, slightly lactic (almost like a Baltic Porter crossed with a coffee stout). Very smooth mouthfeel, lively carbonation combined with subsantial creamy malts and a pleasant chewiness. Some bitters in there from the roasts and a pleasant sweetness to balance it. It really is like coffee and cake, as Dany wrote. A real delight, which Im super stoked to have tried!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
488,"2008-10-08",3.4,"In short: An extra-creamy fruity coffee flavoured chocolate cake in a bottle.  Good stuff
How: Hand-Bottle 12oz from CharlesDarwin, thanks a lot tom
The look: Black body topped by a small tan ring of foam
In long: Body is very creamy.  Taste has creamy black chocolate and with the extra-creamy body I had the impression of a black chocolate cake.  Strong coffee flavour but not the standard roasted coffee beans, the coffee here is more like a cup of freshly brewed black coffee.  As the beer warmed up some molasses and squeezed dark fruits juice was coming out and the beer really felt like a fruity coffee-flavoured creamy chocolate cake.  Body is a bit syrupy but the beer doesnt feel too sweet thanks to a good roastiness level with some floury notes.  Overall this is a rather drinkable tasty stout because it doesnt overdo anything and each flavour element finds its own little space.  I liked it, this is my type of beer, my Cuppa tea.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Thanks to CharlesDarwin for sending this my way as a bonus.  I’ve passed it up at the Great Taste for two years now due to time constraints which is just as well.  This is one to savor instead of rush through at a festival.

Aroma / Appearance - The one finger tan head protected a rich black body and clear sticky lacing.  The nose was basically straight black coffee with a little bitterness.  I am slowly warming to the coffee stout as a style.

Flavor / Palate - The taste of creamy coffee blended with hazel before a bitter transition.  It reminds me of an iced black coffee.  On par with Kentucky Breakfast Stout I think this would be great if it were bottled.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

488,"2008-06-07",4.0,"From a 12oz Handbottle.  Courtesy of CharlesDarwin.  Pitch black, opaque, oily pour with a firm finger of tight bubbled, well sustaining, merangue-like head.  Rich, oily coffee bean aroma with hints of German chocolate cake.  Medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a creamy, velvety texture.  Its like biting into a rich chocolate truffle garnished with an espresso bean. Creamy dark chocolate flavors up front, along with some coffee syrup.  Mid-palate, some lighter, milkier chocolate comes forth, adding a touch of sweetness.  Toward the finish, the bitterness of the coffee starts to take over, building subtley to leave a clean, roasty final smack.  Coffee is well integrated into the flavor profile, making one of the best coffee stouts Ive had in a long time.  Many thanks, Tom!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
488,"2008-05-30",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2010 On tap at the brewpub. Pours pitch black with a thin rim of tan. An acidic, oily deep Italian roast coffee bean nose. Flowing and strong, maybe a touch coarse. Oooh. A dense, rich smooth java flavor. Mmm. Thats good. Nice character, good blending with stout and a bit of alcohol perks up the flavors in a refined Kahlua kind of way. A bit of salt and chocolate dust. Not bad. Balanced. Nice use of higher grounds coffee.

Slightly metallic, and unfortunately, a bit church-coffee-like. Deep oily black pour. Flavors are a bit abrasive. Coffee liquer in chocolate morphs into an espresso bean covered in dark chocolate. The coffee flavor really opens up inside the beer. The flavors are raw and rustic, in a good way. A very foamy beer, with potential hints of infection underneath. The foaminess ruins the potential of oily silkiness I would look for in this beer. Nonetheless, quality flavors persist. Even palate. One of the beers with better coffee flavor in my opinion.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
