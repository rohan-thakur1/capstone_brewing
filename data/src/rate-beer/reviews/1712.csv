Huge everlasting fluffy white head. The beer showed itself in the glass as a beautiful foggy yellow honey brew. Surprisingly lazy and soft carbonation (gushing result?). 
Aroma gives me a strong yeast profile; some bubblegum & banana; distinct wheat aka flour; vague hop spiciness.

1712,"2017-03-08",3.5,"Dark golden color, bordering on copper. Quite nice yeasty and malty aromas, with noticeable banana, and baked wheat bread crust. Not too much clove in the smell. Very yeast-driven flavor, the clove-like phenols really pop out on the tongue. Has a bit of citrus tartness and some sweet bread tones. Finishes a bit metallic and a noticeable hop bite in the end, mixed with spiciness from the yeast. The clove just hangs on the tongue for minutes after a sip. Often, I complain about hefes being not spicy enough, but I feel there is too much yeast character for this to be enjoyable. For me, the style should be thirst quenching and crisp. This has too busy of a palate, the clove-notes keeping this from being refreshing. Id call it good for what it is, very complex, but not my style. Yet, I would buy it again for certain food pairings.","","AaronTDubs"

1712,"2015-12-05",3.5,"Review sample, labeled as Hacker-Pschorr Weiss. Pours a big fluffy head in a tall glass, darker in color, a bit cloudy but more like an American wheat beer than a Hefe Weizen. Slight smell with just a little bit of fruity esters and a slightly spicy compliment from wheat malt. The taste does have a little bit of bubblegum and a slight touch of banana. Not as much spice as we know Weizen, again close to an American wheat style. The sweetness is subdued so theres not as much need for hops to balance it. The fruit and bubble gum in the nose are not as apparent in the taste. It is a little ticket than a Hefe, or for that matter, than a typical lawn mower beer, so be seated while you enjoy. No lemon, please. Some yeast sediment at the bottom but its too solid to pour into your glass. Earlier Rating: 11/14/2003 Total Score: 3.6Import Bottle. I've enjoyed this as a draft a few times, so how does a bottle taste after a long journey? Quite the same. I'm enjoying this as a ""commuter speacial"" (out of the bottle in a brown paper sack on the train). Good spicy weiss smell, actually a tad understated. Cloudy body. Full banana and clove taste, with a hint of lemon. A nice little head works up in the bottle. And a fine, playful effervescence on the tongue.

1712,"2014-08-10",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 10-23-12-
 Poured from bottle into pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a hazy orange amber color with a thick and huge with head. The head has good retention, eventually fading to give a moderate level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of wheat and yeast with some strong aromas of banana and citrus. When mixed with some spice notes it produces one nice hefeweizen aroma.

 Taste  The taste begins with a sweet and bready nature. The sweetness is mainly of an orange citrus nature with the bready nature being of a wheat flavor. As the taste advances more toward the middle, yeasty and spicy flavors come to the tongue. In the end the wheat flavor intensifies and combines with some banana and more orange flavors to leave a quite sweet and pleasant flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the lower then average side in terms of creaminess and thickness with a carbonation level that is fairly average. These are very appropriate for the style and makes for a quite easy drinking brew.

 Overall  Very tasty ad easy drinking. This is a very easy drinking, tasty, affordable and a classic hefenweizen . A nice choice and one to try.","","Darkmagus82"

A: Pours a hazy dark amber color. The head is supremely fluffy, eggshell in color, and about two fingers high. Retention is impressive, and lacing is thick but inconsistent.

S: This is well hopped for the style. And that I can appreciate. The typical banana and clove notes are a bit muted here, but the healthy serving of noble hops make up for it quite well.

T: Now this is more like it. The hops exist merely as a drying mechanism on the back end, helping to cleanse the pleasant sweet cream-meets-banana flavors introduced to the palate. Its simplistic, but its smooth balance means...I kind of want to just drink it instead of review it.

M: Its relatively full bodied and a bit sweet, but that finish really does wonders drying the palate out without going overboard. Carbonation is actually a little subdued, which makes it superb drinkability all the more impressive.

1712,"2013-06-13",3.7,"I poured two 11.2oz bottles into a weizen glass. They had a best before date of September 2012. A six-pack cost me $10.99 which means each bottle cost about $1.83 ($0.16 per ounce).

Appearance: Pours to a very murky rusty orange/brown hue. Only slightly translucent, though carbonation bubbles are easily visible. Forms a rather small, off white, foamy head which never completely dissipates but leaves on minor lacing on the glass.

Smell: All the usual suspects found in a German hefeweizen: banana, clove, cinnamon bread. There is a slight sourness but thats almost assuredly due to the age of the bottles.

Taste: I should disclaim this review by acknowledging the fact its based on bottles that are about nine months past their freshness date. However, I have had Hacker-Pschorr Weisse many times and Ive found it to be one of the better German hefeweizens (though I like Schneider and Weihenstephaner much more). For bottles that are quite possibly a year old they have held up rather well. 

There isnt much to say about the palette here that hasnt already been said about others of the style. You get the classic banana, clove and bready flavors you want in a beer of the style. Though theyre noticeably mild here (probably due to the age). There is still plenty of sweetness on the back end, which is pleasant. Theres some bubblegum flavors as well, especially at warmer temperatures. A fresh bottle would probably garner a higher rating from me, but even these old bottles are still quite enjoyable.

Drinkability: I think hefeweizen is a great style to introduce people to craft beer and Hacker-Pschorr Weisse might be the ideal of the ideal. The mild but flavorful palette is gentle on the tongue. The mouthfeel is soft and comfortable with enough effervescent to give it some zip. It finishes clean and is quite refreshing while in the mouth. At 5.5% ABV its about average in weight for the style, though something a little lighter would be preferable.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1712,"2013-04-05",3.8,"Well, because spring has finally sprung, I decided that I should sit down and review some lighter fare in anticipation of summer.  While Im not really much of a wheat beer drinker anymore, I do appreciate the light body and gentle flavor of a hefeweizen or witbier on a hot day, and this one doesnt disappoint.Appearance: The beer looks very standard to style.  It poured a nice pumpkin orange-to-amber color with a cloud of almost 2 fingers of foamy white head.  Its very hazy, as is to be expected of the style, and it looks enticing in my weizen glass.

Aroma: The smell is spot on for hefe, too.  I get a bit whiff of that banana/ester note with a background of clove, some phenol spiciness, and pure yeast.  It is definitely bready and perfect for a wheat beer.

Taste: This beer has a nice balance of the wheat beer banana and clove (although the clove is much less present in the mouth) from the yeast and wheat and some caramel and toffee sweetness from the malt.  One thing I noticed is that for as complex as the flavors in this beer are, theyre equally gentle, to the point where Id call this beer delicate.  Unfortunately, that means that you really need optimal palate conditions to get all of the complexity; absent this, the beer would be tasty, but it wouldnt come off as nearly as complex.

Mouthfeel: It has a gentle carbonation, and it goes down nice and smooth.

Overall: This is a very nice example of the style.  While I think the Weihenstephaner is a superior beer, Id probably give this beer the silver medal, and thats mainly because of how delicate the flavor is here.  The Weihenstephaner is bold enough to stand up to conditions where your palate might be messed up from a spicy or bold meal, and this beer seems like it would crumble under the weight of garlic or onion.  Honestly, though, I think that the flavors here are excellent, and I can definitely forsee situations where this is the beer Id buy instead of the Weihenstephaner.  (Obviously, you cant go wrong in either situation reallyif you like hefeweizens, that is.)

Overall this is an awesome hefeweizen.  Great flavor balance and complexity; extremely smooth to drink.  One of the better ones in the style I have ever had for sure.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

S: Great funky yeast with some light fruit esters and light hop, pine. 

T: Great banana yeast up front, loving the fruity tartness of this brew.  Nice smooth malty character with just a touch of hoppy spark at the end. Light bubble gum yeast. 

M: Medium bodied, with a nice crisp, but subtly thick feel. Allows for great drinkability and a nice little bubbly gum yeast to be left on the palate.

Got a great pour from the bottle using the ""yeast-swirl"" technique. Head is cream-colored with a bit of yellow; huge and sticks for over 5 minutes. Beer color is like a Texas burnt orange bordering on light brown. Actually quite close to opaque--the yeast haze really clouded it, but pretty evenly.

Only got three quarters of the bottle into the glass, so huge was the head (and how I poured it I suppose). The body is a moody, dull, murky dishwater brown, the head as already stated was huge and creamy.

The usual Hefeweizen smells, but subdued not in your face vanilla, bananas or explosions of yeast from this beer, a gentler aroma comes out.

The taste is also subdued compared to a lot of the Hefeweizen Ive encounted over the years. Its fine, but lacks anything to take it above the stand out ones and is just an average brew in my eyes.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

A lovely prominent aroma after pouring this beer, instantly you are hit with banana, sweet yoghurt, wheat, apricot, toffee apples, vanilla and a gentle booze note. Pours nicely with a well sustained creamy white head and a murky orangey brown vessel underneath it. Tastes amazing, full of wheat, barley, banana, cereals, apricot, subtle citrus initially which fades into ice-creams and eventually a light hop taste in the back of the clean short lived aftertaste. A clean fresh palate, thin but creamy feel with a medium body and a gentle but adequate carbonation.

Poured into weiss glass. Opaque, golden-amber color, with extremely long-lasting white foam. The beer was darker than I expected, much darker than American microbrew imitations, perhaps as a result of traditional decoction mashing? There was definitely a yeast haze, but it was much less cloudy, estery, and phenol-y than American versions as well. The head never went away. I had to keep refilling the glass through the foam, and it persisted at least 15 minutes after the beer was gone! Very neutral aroma, perhaps some grass and very distant clove. Flavor was very neutral as well, malt and hops completely cancelled each other. Soft, mellow mouthfeel of wheat. Slightly citrusy, but no banana or other fruit. Sparkling bottle fermentation.

Aroma first hit me as grassy, but has some sweet banana smell.  This has a nice medium texture and is more complex than I expected.  The sweet banana flavor is tempered by tartness and does not overpower (unlike several bubblegum beers Ive tried).  I enjoyed this more as it warmed up.  Will definitely return to this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"

1712,"2011-06-13",3.5,"Reviewing from Notes. I had this beer at the brewery during Oktoberfest 2010. An amazing experience. This was my first beer of the trip.

A - A nice golden and hazy color with a slightly darker tint then most within this same style. A huge, white and fluffy head.

S - Lots of strong yeast and slight citrus. As a home brewer, I was surprised at how much yeast I picked up on the nose. It smelt almost as if it wasnt ready yet.

T - More the same yeast with clove and banana. I couldnt get over how fresh this beer was. Id love to ask but given the size of the operation and the madness that had already ensued I didnt want to bother the staff. Also, I speak zero German so...

M - Perfect. Not too thin and with the perfect amount of carbonation for my taste. Less is more with me.

D - Great. The low abv and fresh aspects make this one a great one to drink in the summer.

Its easy drinking with a good aroma but I cant say much else good about this.  One possible issue is that the bottle was almost a year old, that could have caused the subdued flavors.  If I ever find a fresh bottle (a big IF, in the States) Ill re-rate.  Otherwise, I was unimpressed.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"

1712,"2009-03-01",2.7,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2009 500 mL Bottle. Like any wheat beer it pours a cloudy deep gold with a 3-finger white head that immediately settles to a 1-finger fluffy layer. This beer has an intriguing aroma of grains, banana, pineapple, an innuendo or orange rind, and a very faint innuendo of cloves; actually very delightful. A layer of sediment at the bottom of the bottle tells me this beer is likely bottle-conditioned and not filtered and pasteurized. The taste doesnt seem to titillate the senses the way the aroma does: grainy-wheaty with an aftertaste of bananas with a hint of pineapple and a slight note of butterscotch in the finish. There is a heavy cloyingness that I find hurts the flavor some. It is a distinct palate that Ill be the first to say is not the ideal of every beer drinker but for one who likes wheat beer, it could be very likeable. Smooth carbonation. It is the aroma alone that boosts whatever rating here, but Ive had better-tasting Heffes.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Papillon"

This centrepiece gives way to a slightly bitter sodium-celery quality. While the beer is medium to heavy bodied, I cannot help but find it watery -- the taste is not nearly as full as the aroma. Sourdough bread was left on my breath after each sip. The aftertaste is short lived. An interesting beer, but the lack of power in its flavour is a tad frustrating. Appearance rating taken from my first crack at tasting this one.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","Gpnterojd"
1712,"2007-08-23",3.6,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tall weizen glass.  This hefeweizen poured a cloudy, dark yellow color with a foamy off-white head that slowly faded away.  Some faint lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of this beer was made up of spicy yeast esthers, light citrus, banana, and some sour dough bread.  The flavor included banana, orange peel, clove, and bread notes.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and refreshing with average carbonation.  This beer is a fine example of a classic style.  Very enjoyable!!!","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

The taste was definitely strange but also kind of refreshing. I tasted lots of wheat and some green olives. A very watery natural orange juice flavor soon arrived, and dominated the taste buds.

Tastes strongly of yeast/wheat, with some delicious malts. This is one of my go-to beers, and probably my favourite hefe thats readily available to me, but the only thing that I take away points for is the slight over-carbonation that distracts a little bit from the taste, and also makes the mouth-feel a little rougher.

It resonated with banana and vanilla aromas, which I found to be normal for the kind of beer it is. The first taste was very memorable as the cream elements just came together with slight edges of hops to make them sparkle. Great beer.

Pours to a hazy, deep golden color, with a tall, thick, rocky, white head, and a vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent with aromas of spicy clove, grainy wheat, and fruity esters of bannana and pear. The palate is firm, with excellent, grainy and tart wheat malt flavor, paired with estery fruity flavors of green apple and pear. This beer finishes with more thirst quenching, tart wheat flavor up front, then ends with some spicy clove flavor that lingers. It is hard to go wrong with a classic German example of Bavarian hefeweizen, and this beer is a classic. A perfect match to a number of German dishes on Ludwigs menu.

I want more from the yeast characteristics.  Rather one dimentional.  Im not getting any tilt toward banana or clove.  You definately don t need a slice of lemon in this one.

Pours a hazy pale orange/gold color with a half inch head, slowly receding to a thin cap that leaves a nice webbing of lace.

Smell; fruity, with bananas and oranges. Theres a bit of cloves and the yeast and wheat you expect in a hefe-weizen.

Taste; nice yeasty bread dough at first and then those oranges and bananas really jump out at you, especially the bananas. Towards the finish this has a very nice spicy bite to it that kind of balances out the bready qualities. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and so very drinkable.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

This beer is frequently served with a slice of some sort of fruit, which I could take or leave.  Even without it, it smells light, fruity, slightly malty, and citrusy.

1712,"2005-09-16",3.5,"(500 ml: $2.19 at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Many of the German Hefeweizens Ive tried have been fairly clean on the palate, but mostly because they werent all that flavorful to begin with.  This beer is quite flavorful, but is still very clean because of the overall balance of the beer.  There is a decent banana component, but its balanced by wheat, clove and a very subtle tartness toward the finish.  All the desired components are present, but none are out of balance.  Again, wheat, banana and clove are in nice balance in the nose.  Medium bodied from start to finish, and though well-carbonated, its quite smooth and easy on the palate.  Dark golden in color and fully cloudy, a tall, off-white head gradually settles to a somewhat thin but full layer, leaving a few spots of lace on the glass.  Not a German Hefeweizen thats big and bold, but neither is it a thin, watery beer.  Nicely done and very enjoyable.  One of the better beers Ive tried in this style.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Poured an opaque, very hazy, lively juicy orange with a large white foamy head, nice thick drapes of lacing.  Aroma - oh yeah, its wheat-y! - of coriander, clove, sharp,ashy hops, lots of fruit essence (citrus, banana - these are esters?), maybe a bit of candyish malt.  Taste - mildly spicy, the hops are there but restrained, enough lemon to make me think someone squeezed a slice in while my back was turned (not the case), again strong on the fruit essence as above, couldnt say there was malt flavour, but it balanced over to the sweet side.

Created a thick yet soft pillow of head and it sat gently over a gold crystal clear beer. The flavor is rather bland, but it does contain some tiny signs of bubblegum, sourgrass and lemon squeeze.

It pours a nice golden color which looks like a tripel but less cloudy.  There is a lot of banana and lemon and surprisingly low carbonation.

Aroma is banana, lemons, spiciness clove (?) yeah definitely clove. Slightly sour aroma, which heightens the attractiveness of all the other smells.

Flavor is tart slightly, but sweet, fruity and crisp. Excellent per style, or otherwise.

Mouthfeel is adequate.

Drinkability is great as this is a good, refreshing, thirst-quenching, but quality brew. When people tell me they want a miller or bud light in the summer because it's refreshing, I have to wonder if they've never experience a refreshing AND flavorful brew such as this one.

Odors of citrus and spice and sweet malt...nice !

Starts peppery like a Heffe-weisse then mellows on the palate with a pleasant departure of the malts mingle with the spicy-citrus hop and yeast tastes...then the finish on this one is glorious...you get a spiced-caramel-biscuit taste then a lingering prickly dryness some banana esters but not over powering like in some heffes.

Taste is alot more of the same, very mellow and even balance of dulled lemon and wheat grainy malts, very fresh with a nice herbal flower sense and very mild playing hops. Everything seems softer then I like in a hefe, needs to be a bit more pronounced in flavors for me, but the herbal quality, which I liked alot, is what kept me drinking this, its delicate and softer approach is nice in that respect. Lighter then medium body with a lightly playing crispness of lemon zip and sweet wheat with a nice soft texture which makes for some very easy drinking on this stuff.

1712,"2003-01-11",4.5,"This is an exceptional wheat beer that should easily rank amongst the top Hefeweizen styled brews in the world.

A textbook classic, featuring a cloudy copper toned appearance that allows for a giant foamy (bubble bath style) head to fill the glass.  Head takes a considerable amount of time to dissipate and leaves extensive lacing around the glass. (Be sure to drink this one from a traditional Weissbier styled glass for full enjoyment).

Super flowery aroma jam packed with the strength of its wheat base plus hints of citrus fruits, clove and a complex selection of malts. 

All of the aromas come through in the taste of this beer with complexities of its fruity palette shining through.  A beer with great characteristics and with an extremely consistent behavior from the first sip to the very last drop.  Enjoy it in good health.

(NOTE: Based on a 500ml bottle sold under the HEFE WEISSE name in Canada.  After much digging on the Internet it would appear that although the beer is often sold throughout the world as either WEISSE and HEFE WEISSE, the brew is supposedly the same thing despite packaging differences and the apparent  availability of both versions at the same time from the same retailer.)","British Columbia, CANADA","49degrees"

This beer is cloudy with the usual protein haze and yeast suspensions. The predominant flavours are yeast oriented: yeastiness, yes but also a balance of cloves and bananas.

1712,"2002-05-02",3.9,"A very solid weisse. The bottles always end with a slightly dry bite which makes me rank Paulaner ahead of this. Still a great beer on a hot summer day.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","adam99"
1712,"2002-05-01",2.3,"Full head and extremely cloudy yellow.  Aroma has an exceptionaly strong wheat presence.  Taste is too much for me and has a thick finish.  One of the best wheats Ive had just not a big fan of this style","Waterford, Wisconsin, USA","duece"

1712,"2002-03-16",2.9,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2012 Bottle (BB Sep 12). Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy light to medium amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with light notes of gum and pepper. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Not much going on in the nose.  Decent enough balance.  Forgettable.  The color of an ur-weisse (this used to be plain yellow before the Paulaner take-over), but lacking the character.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

The color is slightly opaque, the head absolutely magnificent, almost like whipped cream.  The taste is typical but slightly sweeter than others in this category.  The finish is nice but not spectacular.  Overall, a good choice but a little expensive.","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"
