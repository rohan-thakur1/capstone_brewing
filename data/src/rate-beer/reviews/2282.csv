2282,"2016-10-07",4.0,"Its a big fruity boozy beer, just like youd expect for the style. Its perhaps a touch on the sweet side compared to some of the more traditional examples.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2282,"2016-08-18",3.9,"Best before December 6th 2017

A small pop when I pulled the cork out, it pours a clear reddish brown with a finger of off white foam. Lacing is impressive


Loads of caramel malt in the smell with some dark pitted fruit thats on the subtle side. The sweet seems likely to be influenced by candi sugar, I reckon.

Tastes of caramel malt and probably a bit of oxidation. Dark fruits are a mild presence. Candi sugar here but doesnt cause any over sweetness. Alcohol is definitely there and brings oodles of warming.

Close to a syrupy mouthfeel, I really do like this Quad.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"

2282,"2013-07-11",4.5,"The Abbot 12 won a Gold Medal at the 2005 Great American Beer Festival and is described by the brewery as: ""A strong, dark ale with notes of raisins, figs, and caramel, and a pronounced dark rum character. Deceptively smooth at 10.5% alcohol, this strong ale is ideal as an after-dinner sipping brew.""

This bottle listed a 9.9% abv with an original gravity of 22.5 plato, and poured out with a generous lingering tan head. The dark aged fruit aromas wafted up and brought to mind rich brown malts, mixing with some background yeast spiciness. The flavor was candi-sugar sweet, with the slightest hint of cocoa/dark chocolate, a little alcohol as it warmed brought to mind rum, sweetly blanketing the mouth with its rich, thick body. This beer reminds me of Westvleteren, and thats not a comparison made often, if at all.

This beer is the perfect accompaniment to a crisp, cool fall evening, sipped slowly along with a snack of nutty, sharp, aged Holland gouda. I think that Im going to need a case of this beer to survive the coming winter.","new york, New York, USA","bob_w"

Extremely complex flavour, with a wonderful integration of the different flavours - the sweetness is perfectly situated, never becoming cloying. Not as elegant as something like Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus 12, but certainly one of the best American quads. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2282,"2013-06-27",4.0,"Best before January 24, 2017.
Appearance: This is a beautiful quad, from deep garnet hue that is absolutely crystal clear to the thin but dense light tan head that settles into a dense coating. This wants to be drank.
Aroma: The aroma is unfortunately mild, but theres a deep fruitiness to it that hints at fig, grape and medicinal cherries on the pour that yields to a spicy dough aroma. I wish the aroma were stronger as its great.
Taste: The flavor takes the aroma and amplifies it in strength, giving this a deep fruit flavor backed by light spices. The fruit flavors hint at syrupy grape and cherry along with a hint of figs that intertwine from start to finish over top of a doughy body that finishes spicy. Boy this sips nice.
Palate: Thick and slightly syrupy with light carbonation that has a slightly sharp edge to it.
Overall: This is an excellent quad, I will not be passing up this brewerys beer anymore. I highly recommend buying this if you see it, though I wonder if this would really hold up to a few years of age. I think this is ready to go now.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Aroma is complex, dark fruits, booze, cake, and some other fancy stuff. Although this beer may have been somewhat damaged by the lack of carbonation. Taste might be a little on the sweet side.

2282,"2012-08-13",3.8,"Bottle generously gifted by jaywahk73, an appreciator of fine Belgian ales. Thanks a lot, Jeff!

Served in my Corsendonk tulip.

The appearance is a mostly transparent brown hue, with sunset orange highlights apparent when held to the light. A gentle pour yields nearly a half inch of head that displays lasting retention and leaves ample lacing on the glass.

The aroma is fantastic and instantly identifiable as a quadrupel. Dark fruits, Belgian yeast, malt, spice...just wonderful.

The taste is quite good. Fortunately, I have most of the 750 mL bottle left to sip over the next hour or two. The taste brings a prominent yeast flavor, as well as dark fruit and dark Belgian ale characteristics. Additionally, the beer has an underlying sweetness one would expect from a quad, and a hint of warming alcohol. Brown sugar and figs are in there as well. Nice and complex, a wonderful sipper.

The feel is really smooth and quite well done. Impressive. Alcohol content is disguised well. Carbonation level is moderately high, but not overly so.

This beer has some pretty mixed reviews. Perhaps there is some deviation in bottles and/or batches. I know the bottle I am enjoying is fantastic. This is without question the best American quad I have had.

Appearance : Clear shining copper with small bubbly head.

Aroma : Spices with red fruits and some caramel. Brown sugar with lots of spices. A bit yeasty. 

Palate : Pretty much flat.

Taste : Sweet caramel with nice malt. Brown sugar with spices. Spicy finish with more brown sugar and light hops. Enjoyable finish but quite sweet.

Overall : Not bad but not very refined. Carbonation is very soft, especially for the style. A bit too sweet even if it had time to mellow (this was 3-4 years old). A bit of a disappointment.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

2282,"2011-06-11",4.2,"750ml bottle, shared by a good friend.  Thanks Joel.  It is difficult to reproduce Belgian ales.  Many have tried, but this  is something best left to brewers who truly understand the essence of these liquid masterpieces.  In this case, I believe Southampton got it right!  The ale pours a dark brownish-red.  Head is medium and off-white, quickly dissipating to a small ring around the glass.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, bread, malt, dark fruit and spices.  Taste is delicious, with malt, sweet carmalized candy sugar and dark fruit.  Finish is smooth and sweet with just a touch of boozy warmth.  This is a nice ale, perhaps the best quadruple Ive tasted; aside from those originating in Belgium.  This brewery continues to produce delicious Belgian inspired ales.

Subtle roast aroma mixed in with dark fruits, yeast, and a fairly pungent raisin aroma. Sugar makes itself known as well. New aromas are popping out at me at different times; now, I am getting a subtle fruity plum aroma. The light plum, burnt sugar, yeast, roast, raisins, and light alcohol flavors are mix quite well together. This is a definitely an assertive Abt. A little too hot at times. The texture is nice and rich. The roast flavor is a nice added twist to an Abt, but I like it. As it warms, I am getting a light grape flavor. A very nice Abt made by an American brewery is a winner in my book.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

2282,"2009-09-19",3.9,"From a 1.5 year old bottle, and actually the first example of this beer that Ive had.
Deep almost burgundy color--looks very much like maple syrup--with a small white head that dissipates quickly.  Smells remind me of candied figs and apricots, but theres also some vanilla here. Theres a rum called, I believe, sailor Jack, which has a very similar and appealing aroma.  
When it comes to taste, the same flavors hinted in the aroma come through, with the addition of a distinct cinnamon element.  Its a big beer and you really get the volume here with a lot of syrupy bigness. A previous reviewer called out toffee and I think thats spot on. 
Finish lingers with a seriously raisin taste. Very good beer, but after one glass Im satisfied.  I think this is one to split.","New York, New York, USA","nramsburg"

2282,"2009-08-04",2.8,"She poured with no head or discernable foam. A few scattered bubbles can be seen lazily floating across her glassy surface which refracts rich mahogany wood with hints of deep garnet highlights. Swirling the contents in my glass has no effect on her head, but it does release a pungently thick cloud of super-sweet maple syrup with a side offering of molasses. Aunt Jemima anyone? As I try to work my way past the basin of maple syrup, some dark, pitted fruits can be found gasping for air: dates, figs, and prunes. Dark breads are drenched in maple syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg along with, interestingly enough, a dry herbal finish which brings to mind rosemary and thyme. Im a bit leery as I dive into her depths and am met by an awaiting sea of maple syrup and molasses, thick, super-sweet, and instantly mouth-coating to the point of being overly cloying. She is far too sweet for my tastes and really too sweet for the style. Did I get a bad bottling? Supping onward, as I tread through all the maple, I occasionally stumble across some raisin bread, prunes, and dates. There is no discernable carbonation which furthers my concern that I am tasting a bad bottling. The faint esters of spice and herbs which were in her nose are nowhere apparent in her palate. As I choke down the last of my Southampton Abt 12 I am left highly disappointed and wishing for some St. Bernardus Abt 12 to make things right again.


After speaking with my good friend Eric, I am seriously considering the bottle I tasted to be a fluke. The only way I will be able to find out for sure is to hunt down another bottle of the Abt 12 from Southampton and give her another tasting. If there is no difference though, then I will stand by my lackluster and smothered impression of this fancily packaged bottle of maple syrup. Pancakes anyone?

2282,"2009-04-13",2.8,"750mL bottle courtesy of shaebs99 labeled 9.9% ABV on the bottle, poured into a snifter.

When I ""popped"" the cork, I was a little suspicious things might be off as there was nary a sound.  The cork just slid right out.  An aggressive pour yielded only a few big bubbles that recedes immediately leaving no ring and no lacing.  The color was a deep, clear brownish amber.  Not much life to this one.

Despite being a dead bottle, the aroma and taste were still good.  The aroma is very sweet with tons of candi sugar, fruity esters and dark fruits, especially raisins.  The alcohol burns the nostrils a little bit after a couple whiffs.

The taste is also very sweet with lots of raisins and brown sugar.  The dark malts really come out in the taste and a bit of spices in the finish, but nothing too over-the-top.

The mouthfeel is where my bottle has clearly suffered.  Its almost completely still with no carbonation whatsoever.  This makes for a slick and very thin mouthfeel that is subpar for the style, or any style.

This was clearly a bad bottle, but Ill stick with my review until I can find a good one to try.  The aroma and taste were clear indications of a very good quad underneath, but this one had completely lost its carbonation.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Scant traces of jagged line lacing marks the glass.  Aromas include brown sugar, caramel, raisins, figs, floral hops, and mild, dark spices.  Flavors are very much the same, with sweet brown sugar and stewed raisins dominating.  Further sweetness comes from candied figs, dates, and vanilla, with very little balancing bitterness.  Dense and medium-full in the mouth, the sweet, syrupy body gets to be cloying.  This is a nice brew, but it is too over the top sweet to be a favorite of mine.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

If you were looking for a dry and airy palate this wasnt it. Smooth and gripping on the palate, letting the layers of flavors do their thing without interruption. Not a brainstorming session of flavors, more the pin you down and listen to what I have to say, and Ill say, it was rather convincing.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"

Luscious combination of fruity ester and malt characters, bringing out notes of fruitcake, brazil nuts, muscat grapes, and maple bark.  Edges of mace and coconut perfume, although the spicy phenols are well restrained.  A mild alcohol presence is also detectable in the nose, but is soft and warming.  Light bodied, highly carbonated mouthfeel with a moderately dry palate.  Fruity caramel and raisin malt characters erupt instantly on the palate - great richness and fullness in body, but at the same time, maintains the high level of carbonation and lightness required to keep this dancing on the tongue.  Estery plums and more nutty characters.  Touches of biscuity malt, but sweetened by edges of muscavado sugar.

Abbot 12!  Sweet strong aroma, you know this has a kick right from the olfactory. Slightly darker than the typical pale ale. Surprisingly good carbonation for a quad, makes it much more acceptable.

Fruity aroma, mostly cherry with other dark fruits in the background. Candi sugar also makes its presence known. 

A sip evokes that classic quadrupel taste; dark fruits like fig and raisin, chewy malt, a faint yeastiness, candi sugar. This beer however has something I havent picked up in other quads (except for 3 philosophers for obvious reasons): a nice subtle dark cherry flavor. 

The mouthfeel would have been spot on if it wasnt for the overcarbonation here. It makes the quaffing rocky and belching frequent.

2282,"2007-12-12",4.0,"750 ml bottle - Columbus X tasting
Thanks to the person who brought this along.  It has been on my radar for a while now as an American version of the style that seems to do everything right.  After having had it I have to agree.  Its not quite on par with the best in the world but this stacks up favorably with anything but the best Trappist quads.  If I find it again I will be sure to buy a bottle.
Aroma / Appearance - A half finger tannish head floated peacefully above a semi transparent chocolate body.  Caramel, coffee, liquer and cherry pie created a seamless combination of dark aromas.  Chocolate truffle oil held it all together like superglue.  It was not as complex as the richest quads but compared to everything else this was 95% perfect.
Flavor / Palate - Chocolate and caramel coated the tongue.  It had a thick mouthfeel that clung to every corner of the mouth and throat.  The alcohol was evident without being too overpowering.  I wish it had been opened earlier in the night so I could have enjoyed it more fully.  I might have been able to enjoy a larger sample then.  As it was I found myself debating getting more.  This is an excellent interpretation of the Quad style and worth tracking down if you can.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The carbonation does a good job of shooting off tones of cinnamon, rum, grapes, citrus-laden sugars which seem to settle in a lightly bittered finish.

The scent was raisins, figs, alcohol, malt and dried fruit.  There was a nice quad taste with big rushes of flavor, mostly raisins and malt.  There is a slight alcohol burn in the finish.  A very nice quad.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"

Strong carbonation and heavy bodied.  Sweet caramel/raisin nose.  Flavor is a balanced sweet fruity/raisin and hops.  Caramel finish.  High ABV is hidden but it is warming. One of the rare beers that I dont find anything wrong with it.  Pricey (but worth it to try) at $13.00 for a 750ml corked bottle from Tullys Beer and Wine Wells, ME.","Bow, New Hampshire, USA","jimhilt"

2282,"2007-08-12",3.0,"Blah. Did I get a bad bottle? Aroma was pleasant but stale. Caramel and dark fruits. Pour was a flat light brown with no head at all. Taste was uncarbonated...same texture as a Guiness. Flat as water. Hot caramel and dark fruits in the taste, but thats about it. Strong alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Nothing complex. The lack of any carbonation and the reviews below me tell me this beer is actually carbonated and I had a flat bottle. Must re-rate.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
2282,"2007-08-10",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2009 bottle poured a red maroon in color with good lively carbination leaving a frothing head that bubbled from the center like a volcano. smell is sweet fruits, somewhat dry, spices, and yeasts. the flavor is just as good as the smell, there is a lot of flavors going on that meld well. texture is rich, fruits like dates and plums, there are a few spicy flavors from yeasts and some malt backbone that makes it smooth. the carbination is what really brings all the flavors across the tongue, has a somewhat sticky sweet taste as you drink it but not in the aftertaste. as the beer warms many more layers come across the tongue, and for something with 10% abv. this is really something. definitely high up on the list of to try beers.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"
2282,"2007-07-27",4.1,"This is a very impressive immitation belgian brew by Southampton. The pour reveals a clear ruby-hued burnt orange with a lasting, rocky, tan head. The aroma was yeasty, fruity, spicy and earthy, very complex. There was sweet dark pitted fruits, raisins, dates, clove, lemon grass, caramel, molases and yeast that all together resembled a sweet soy sauce of some kind. The flavour was equally as complex with the addition of bready malts that werent detectable in the aroma. The palate wasnt as effervescent and lively as I hoped it might have been, but it was smooth. The body could have been a bit fuller. The flavours, as the beer warmed, began to sweeten further, becoming almost syrupy. The alcohol was hidden well by the sweet, fruity and spicy flavours. I also detected some chocolate and caramel flavours too.  COMPLEX. A must try for all who appreciate the Belgian style.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"
2282,"2007-07-18",4.0,"I have to admit that I was thrilled to find a Quad from Southampton as I have really grown to love their beers. This one was a maghony color with a very very sweet taste. It is different from some other quads but quite enjoyable none the less. This was more of a dessert beer, but a quality attempt at a hard to reproduce Belgium classic.","Burlington, New Jersey, USA","fozapd"
2282,"2007-07-16",3.5,"Dark reddish orange, small head with blah lacing and retention. Aroma is raisin, plum, usual spices, light yeast. Medium to heavy body with a very sweet finish, some alcohol.

2282,"2007-07-15",2.4,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2008 Tried this again, and it was absolutely disgustingly sweet, even worse than before. Did the yeast die off before it could finish? Undrinkable mess. Thanks for sharing a bottle, iowaherkeye. The body was dark orange with a large light khaki head. The aroma was funky cinnamon with some peaches and flowers. The taste was very sweet with some peaches and some hints of cinnamon. There was also some rich fruit, like canned cherries. Some light pancake character. The more I drank the sweeter it got. The body had a slightly chewy character with nice subtle cabonation. Did I mention this was too sweet?","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
2282,"2007-07-15",4.4,"Combination of an 03 bottle from Pailhead and 06? bottle from adrian910ss. thanks to the both of you. 03 had tons of rotten dark fruit, huge malt backbone. Flavor again huge malt, residuel sweetness, not much fruit whatsoever. Seems one-dimensional. 06 bottle much nicer. Huge dark fruit and caramel/mollasses combo up front. Faint alcohol in the background. Flavor much the same, fig/prune/raisin/candied plums up front. Through the middle its all residuel sweetness, not cloying whatsoever though. Finishes with a touch of alcohol, helps clean the palate a little. Huge sticky body and mouthfeel. Well done.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
2282,"2007-07-09",3.7,"Bottle. Aroma has a straw malt note with herbs and lemon for the hops and theres a heavy smell of soap and musty basement for the yeast. Head is big and rocky thats off white with good lacing and is fully lasting. Color is a clear red/brown. Flavor is harshly sweet and moderately acidic and finishes moderately sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium, between oily and watery and it has lively carbonation. A little too sweet but tastey none the less.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

2282,"2007-06-26",4.4,"Tap @ Blind Tiger, NYC.  Pours a deep reddish-brown with a puffy white head.  The aroma is complex, with bready notes, spices, and that unmistakable Belgian ""funk.""  The beer is smooth on the tongue and complex on its way down.  This is my favorite American-made Belgian ale and one of my favorite beers of all time.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
2282,"2007-06-25",4.0,"750 ml bottle. This was a very very impressive Belgian style, probably the best American made Belgian style I have ever had. The head on this one was the biggest I have ever scene and it wasnt Belgian lace on my glass but a thick creamy foam that you could eat with a spoon. The body looked a little to flat or else this could have been a 5 for appearance. Aroma had a slight metallic scent that I found odd, especially since this was in a corked not capped bottle. Also present was brown sugar, light malts, dough, sweet bread and lots of yeast. Flavor was impacted with that metalliciness also and was sweet with notes of brown sugar and lots of yeast. If that metalliciness was missing this one would of rated a little higher so I will try this again to see if it was just this one bottle or if they are all like that.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
2282,"2007-06-23",4.0,"Very dark, almost opaque brown, with a colossal off-white head. Sweet, dirty nose, with touches of cherry and black pepper, some chocolate and alcohol. So effervescent that the taste is obscured a bit--the CO2 really attacks your tongue. Once you get over that bite, it is really a very nicely balanced beer indeed. Rather sweet, with some apples, currants, anise, black pepper, plums--rich, complex, certainly on par with the best of the style. Thanks for Adrian910ss for sending this to the Midwest.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
2282,"2007-06-23",4.1,"Bottle.  Deep amber w/ small but persistent head.  Not a huge, sweet, dark candy sugar flavor as found in some other quads Ive tried.  Smoother and a little drier than most.","Freeport, Georgia, USA","jimbowood"
2282,"2007-06-23",4.0,"Pours dark mahogany with a head of large bubbles.  Aroma is dried fruit , spice and a bit of roasted malt.  Flavor is sweet, but not overbearingly so.  Dried fruit (fog and raisin) flavors are the most present, with a nice tartness also in the mix.  Alcohol flavors are present, but remain in the background.  A very nice quad.","Southington, Connecticut, USA","bobaidan"
2282,"2007-06-15",3.6,"Pours a dark brown, with a thin, quickly diminishing off white head.  Smells of sausage, a little smoke, tartness, and dark malts.  The taste is very sweet, smoky, and malty all bunched up together.  The sweetness kind of overpowers the rest of it.  Almost sugary.  Makes the mouth feel like youve been sucking on sugar cubes.  Maybe a touch too sweet, but still quite good.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
2282,"2007-06-14",3.5,"Bottle from puzzl. Fairly clear, auburn body with little apparant carbonation. The aroma is fairly sweet, toffee, caramel, rum, raisins, bananas and spice. The flavor is moderately sweet, ripe plums, raisins, lots of toffee and a bit of clove. Medium body is very soft with almost zero carbonation. Looks like this bottle was a fluke in that it didnt carbonate. I suspect the high level of sweetness to be residual priming sugars. Fortunately, I have another bottle of this.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
2282,"2007-06-12",4.0,"Courtesy mgumby10. Dark ruby/amber. Small layer of white foam. Aroma of smoked breakfast sausage, dark fruits- some acai for sure, light spiciness, bread, rich caramel, and airy yeast. Flavor of chocolate, toffee,  light smoke, less meat, more dark fruits, spiciness, heavy bread, subtle tartness from the yeast. Complex brew. Full body, balanced carbonation is foamy yet very soft. Great brew.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
2282,"2007-06-10",3.8,"Bottle from Capones, shared with Mad_indian. Pours deep amber with a large khaki colored head. Aroma of belgian spices, yeast, fruit, and caramel.

2282,"2007-06-08",3.7,"25 oz bottle, via adrian910ss.  Pours a clear orangish amber colored body under a large fluffy beige head that slowly deflated to a partial covering.  Some light spotty lacing.  Aroma is very fruity with lots of Belgian yeast influence.  Light alcohol, raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, grapes, and candi sugar.  Flavor is knock you over the head sweet with lots of candi sugar and raisin notes.  Minimal alcohol flavor with light yeast on the finish.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, but stops short of being overly cloying with very nice pinpoint carbonation.  Finishes with a slight warming sensation.  A pretty good beer, but way below what I expected.  I gotta say, I suppose that I just dont care for much from Southampton save for the Imperial Russian Stout that Ive had thus far.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2282,"2007-06-04",4.4,"This beer is superb.  Creamy white head.  Hint of vinousness in the nose along with the yeastiness.  Sweetness just this side of cloying, but so tasty.  Like a raisin nut granola bar.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
2282,"2007-06-02",4.0,"Pours out dark brown with slight reddish tinge. Moderate foamy white head. Aroma was sweet with some notes of fruit and slight yeast.

Slight earthy notes going on in the background but sweetness is what come through the most.","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"
2282,"2007-06-01",4.5,"Bottle from Capones (actually, 4 bottles in storage...thanks, Matt!!), that I just popped.  The pour is hazy ruby/orangy thru direct light, looking deep ruby through ambient light, with a Brobdingnagian head, about 3-fingers of sticky white foam that sounds like the sound of the nether regions of a woman in the throes of direct multiple-finger manual digital manipulation.  Just delightful!  The aroma is trappisty, with the caramelly malt, big fruit, including figs and berries, cognac, funky yeasty peaty notes, and cabernet.The flavor is...wow...tons of fruit of the cherry, berry, fig variety, coupled with a solid malt presence, plus that candi sugary, brown sugary, funky yeasty true Belgian taste profile.  The fruit remains, as does the malt, throughout, with a solid funky yeasty flavor, well hidden alcohol, and even more cherry/berry as it warms, with subdued hops and merging spicy notes.  I dare say this one would hold its own against the trappists of the world, and this one solidifies Phil Markowski as a true God among men as far as beer brewing goes.  Fucking outstanding!!!!!","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2282,"2007-06-01",4.4,"wow, one of the firsst american style abbey beers that match up well with the Belgain styles. great orange(y) amber color, and the nose had the classic Rummy aroma. flavors of rum,raisins, and plums. as complex as they come, alcohol well hidden.","lansdowne, Pennsylvania, USA","highpoint"
2282,"2007-05-29",3.9,"Good sized frothy off-white head of varying sized bubbles.  Very good carbonation.  Plums, spices, candy sugar and some roasted malts in the aroma.  Nice but not as complex or as smooth as some of the quads.  Color is a ruddy dark brown.  Malty and spicy with a hint of metallic up front.  Lively in the mouth.  Nice alcohol presence and warming.  The body is a little watery for a quad.  Sweet and fruity late swallow.  Lingering alcohol heat and spices (pepper, nutmeg).  A very good belgian strong ale but lacking depth and body to be a quad.  A very good brew none-the-less.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"
2282,"2007-05-27",4.0,"750 ml bottle.  I thought I had missed the boat with this beer, and living so close to SPH, I have no excuse.  Thankfully, a trip to Brooklyn and a visit to American Beer corrected my oversight.  Pours a slightly hazy copper-brown with a thin off-white head that left very nice window pane lacing down the entire glass.  Aroma is decidedly sweet with lots of caramel, sugar, and to a lesser extent yeast and raisins.  The flavor is again sweet with plenty of caramel and rock candy, and to a lesser extent some raisins and dates. The alcohol at 10% was very well hidden.  A well crafted interpretation of the style.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

2282,"2007-05-20",3.5,"Bottle from trade with.john_adam2002. Thanks Adam. Pours a hazy amber with a a thick, sudsy, well carbonated head. You could hear the crackling from the carbonation throughout--a little too much for my liking to tell the truth. Nose is odd for a quad--smelled more like a belgian wit--lots of coriander and spices. Flavor was sweet and spicy. I really was expecting a lot more with this brew and didnt really deliver for me.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
2282,"2007-05-16",3.7,"Pours cloudy amber/brown with a massive, foamy/rocky/bubbly tan head. Strong aroma of apple and spice, with a floral note, good bit of yeast, and a hint of tobacco. Flavor is sweeter than expected, with fruited nutty note mid-palate, and a sugary floral finish. Palate is medium, effervescent, brown sugary sweet, with some lingering floral tartness. A bit on the sweet side for my tastes, but has a nice complexity, and will probably age nicely. Too bad these SH 750s are so pricey.","Hawthorne, New Jersey, USA","jblendy"
2282,"2007-05-13",3.8,"750ml corked bottle from MrBendo, thanks a million dude. Served in my St. Bernardus glass: Pours a mahogany hue with a fading head but there is some oily tears along the way. The aroma has notes of non-aromatic pipe tobacco, sweet and acidic apple, a hint of white grape, sugar smack cereal, some English toffee, red liquorice, and a underlying earthy yeast ester.  The taste starts heavily fruity and some what nutty as well. What I found interesting is the presence of a mix of wild flowers upon the finish along with some light-handed spice. A complex flavor profile that is only beginning to develop. My bottle is young and would expect a mellow and marriage to continue with age.  There is a carbonated lively character with cleans up the palate form all those heavier malt profiles. The alcohol is moderate and warming but hardly in the way. This is a good beer and a must try for all lovers of BIG Belgian styled brews. After a few disappointments from Southampton, this meets expectations.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Body is slightly above average with no alcohol discernable.

2282,"2007-01-07",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2017 January 10th, 2017 - Second after the Southampton Cuvee des Fleurs is a darker, bolder taste of the Abbot 12. My standards are exceedingly high for Belgian Strong Ales, and I have found too many styles in the US that get dark and sweet with the style, which I think cripples the elegance of the style. The Abbot 12 looks and smells like it should, dark brown with a good layer of sawdust colored foam. The aroma is fruitier than what I typically look for, but it pushes more fig than cherry, which I rather like. And that heavy fig punch keeps sweeping through to the flavor, pushing fig from the beginning of the sip all the way through to the end. Is it the delicate balanced Belgian beers of the abbeys and St. Bernardus types? Certainly not, but if you want something like those but with a pronounced fig to it, the Abbot 12 is an affordably delicious option.

This was by far the superior offering Southampton brought to the table at the 2006 GABF.  There must be something to the Quad prefix because every time I pick up a bottle of such it ends up being as complex and entertaining as any good work of Victorian literature.  The Abbott 12 carries the tradition with pride, offering up a slightly jumbled but toothsome array of tongue pleasers that managed to pierce the rapid beer tasting haze with an incredulously mild mannered but complex flavor profile.  In my tiny sampling glass I see a clouded, brown mixture which, humble as it may be, practically begs to be consumed.  I oblige, but first I give it a quick smell sample.  The profile reads out with almost nothing.  The aroma is very timid.  Nothing perceptible comes through except some alcohol, so I leave its bashful self alone and move onto the taste, which I hope will be a little more extroverted.  Im rewarded with the stellar taste I mentioned above.  Burnt honey, caramel and roasted apple immediately remind me of a thousand small town candy stores Ive passed by in my life.  At each one I peered through the window with eager eyes.  They shined with gluttony as I glanced at the copper bowl where a worker is crafting gorgeous candied apples.  It is an art lost on the urbane.  A little charred wood adds to the quaint and cozy story the Abbott 12 is weaving, invoking a small fire with a few ruddy faces gathered round it.  Theres also a sizeable mountain of brown sugar entangled in the beer, coaxing me with its mature, sugary flavor.  Most distinguishable is all the flavors of burnt carbon matter.  Each one makes up a different flavorful fuel, but they all cooperate with their shared history of arson victimization.  The delicately organized taste is but short lived, and soon disappears leaving only the brown sugar to console the tongue with its murky molasses.  This would be the ideal company for any late evening outing to a building older than fifty years.  The whole character beautifully matches with many of these old mining towns in the Rocky Mountains whove relied on their old, rustic charm to keep the revenue flowing.  If they could only offer up this Abbott 12 on a regular basis it would make for an unforgettable evening of relaxation and rumination. 6/3/10/4/19 4.2","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Root beer brown color with smaller but lingering head of medium bubbles, evenly dispersing.  The aromas are not typical quad, as the beer is reminding me foremost of a milder dubbel with more fruity yeast presence than dark fruits and nuts.  As it warms, Im proved wrong and the beer explodes wtih figs, prunes, raisins, fresh plums, ripe pears, caramelized, and yummy winter breads.  The palate is spot on for a quad, at once lively in its eff and fully coating the palate.  Flavors run the gamut of aromas, very good consistency, and the yeast becomes wonderfully important to the complexity of the stuff.  With even more temp, the alcohol becomes all to familiar, but at elast this one doesnt have the diacetyl issues present in so many of SHs beers.

Lots of spicy yeast and a great bready maltiness.  Sweet, but it has dried out significantly in the last year, greatly improving the beer.  There is a lightly peppery character and a lovely minty finish on the back.  As it warms, the breadiness kicks in adding a silky smooth body on top of the great layers of fruit and spice.

2006 vintage sampled at the brewpub.  Dark brown/orange beer with a thick yellow head.  Aroma of dark malt, rye bread, toast, molasses, dark buckwheat honey and a light floral character lingering throughout the whole sweet mass.  Flavour is quite sweet and complex, but not terribly harmonious.  Sweet toast, strong molasses and brown sugar notes that seem to clash more than these types of flavours should.  A bit of burnt sugar.  Alcohol is well hidden but it will take awhile for all of this stuff to blend together and balance.  Ill have to try this in a year or two.  As it warms some more balance appears in the malts.  It is definitely sweet enough and lacks the hotness that Ive found in a lot of SPH big brews, bit it still need some time to become great.

2282,"2005-08-17",2.8,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2006 2002 bottle generously provided (as always) by Eyedrinkale.  Sampled July 2005.  Pours a drab, olive-brown, with some dark blackish-violet tinged colors and some dark, orangish-tan-brown notes.  Interesting color, all told, and quite fair to the style (though lighter overall).  A thin film of head covered the beer to start, off-white to yellowish cream colored, but is not long-retained, though it did lace well.  There were large protein chunks in the bottom of the glass. The beer was very murky.  Aroma smells of concord grapes.  Yep, hugely vinous and very strange.  Brown malt sweetness that was expected is not there, but there is a dry, raisiny, bitter chocolate note and some beginning notes of oxidation.  Flavor was more telling of the condition this was in (not a good one), and was the equivalent of a big dose of moderately sweet, flat, fermented grape juice (not quite the elegance of a wine).  Raisiny, moderately sour on the finish, with some sherry and light cardboard.  Slick, loose consistency, with a very low carbonation.  The body is there, but it is just so vinously grapey that I can barely choke down my glass.  The alcohol was not apparent, that was a nice touch, but it just did not do much good.  Some vanilla and almond notes try to break in the mix, but the sourness holds it back, while the bitter chocolate/light roast and huge concord grape flavor sap all enjoyment.  Everyone remarked how bad and undrinkable it was, and how passed its prime.  And I agree.  Not sure how anyone that tasted it alongside me gave this over a 3, but whatever, to each his own, I guess.A note on why I chose to rate this.  I know, having personally seen EDAs cellar that he takes very good care of his bottles and I cant imagine this to be any exception.  Hell, at 10% and this magnitude of malt, it would take a lot to unnaturally disrupt this beer.  I love Phils beers more than the next guy, but I think its only fair to review the bad with the good.  Im sure the much acclaimed 2003 Abbot 12 will be much more to my liking (I hope anyways) and will give it its due when I open it.  6/3/4/2/82006 bottle from the Hop Devil Grill, drunk on 9/22/06.Strong beige-ivory colored head perches well atop a deep, brown-auburn-mahogany body, with light violet-crimson highlights on the edges.  Lacing is moderate, and retention is moderate as well.  Bottle conditioned.Sweet, sticky fruits in the nose: prunes, raisins, currants, gooseberries, elderberries.....Strong caramel and sweet toffee are certainly not subtle, while a lightly oily/leathery yeastiness, mixed in with some vaporous fusels join the fray on the finish.  Banana and vanillin-like notes add some estery drynes, and the dry fruits help balance, but it is still awfully sweet and rather raw.Surprisingly, I think the flavor comes through somewhat more refined than the aroma.  Perhaps the alcohol playing foil to the heavily sweet toffe-breadiness and sticky caramel gives a glimpse of balance.  Peppery phenols build up quickly, however, and while there is some soft, banana bread-like chewiness, and a bit of smooth brown sugar, the heavily drying alcohol and phenols overbalance the finish and you get a flavor profile that moves from heavily sweet to heavily dry/borderline astringent, without much in between.  Certainly this is due, in part, to its very young age and no doubt this beer should develop much better cohesiveness after a year or so.  Dark fruit skins, light cocoa powder and more vanilla round off the finish.  Definitely an eye opener, and something to be sipped.  Carbonation is very heavy at first, and takes patience to let settle.  6/4/7/3/14.  Score is an average of the two years.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

After having the Impy Stout and Grand Cru, I just didnt imagine this one could be as good as it was.  I always enjoy  La Trappe Quad, Rochefort 10, etc. but this one will be my  quad of choice from now on.  Love the golden amber color...slight white-ish head.  Very sweet, malty nose..maybe some light fruits...very enticing.  Wonderful brown sugary, molasses-toffe malts on the tongue, more fruits like raisins, prunes, figs and the like.  Just a flat-out full bodied flavor laden ale....smooth, syrupy, rummy  and to the point.  What a late night sipper, and that becomes more apparent as it warms.

This is the best Abt/Quad by a significant margin!  The sum of our 9 tasters agree.
2003 bottle.  The aroma is divine, with dark fruit and pineapple.  I was wise to sniff this for a while and let it warm.  While staring at the froth, the flavors were awaiting my tongue.  As the different fruits bounced off my tongue, the caramel candy apple coating was settling on my tongue.  Everything in balance here, the sweetness, the spiciness, the creaminess.  The transition from start to finish is a long, enjoyable ride.

Pours a dark cola brown with slight red and yellow at the edges, fluffy but sort of lumpy (large carbonation bubbles) gray-tan head that fades at first but lingers in a whisp with good retention.  Very good lacing but not thick enough head, possibly as a result of the size of the bubbles.  Figgy brown sugar nose with nice dark yeastiness and wonderful balance.  Rich, sweet dark fig flavor with very yeasty brown candi sugar, dark bread, and other dark dried fruit flavors.  Dry mouthfeel, medium-full with a long finish, lightly bitter, dry, and very lovely.  An excellent, elegant beer, and the best American iteration I have had of this Belgian delight.  Stands up to the finest examples from the old country, and Id love to be able to age some of this a couple of years for it to really come into its own, as the hints of brown sugary sweetness were the only real detriments to its otherwise classic and perfectly refined balance of dryness and juiciness.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

2006 vintage:
Plastic-like, rubbery phenols nag the aroma immensely...Alcohol warms behind the caramel fruitiness and roasted berries...Mouthfeel is as pleasant as it was, flavor is a little bothered by the phenols, but that aroma is really the downfall of most of my enjoyment of this vintage...Hopefully this is a bad bottle, but I doubt it, as it was bought directly at the brewery a few days ago...Another fallen, once great Southampton big beer?...3.3/5

2003 vintage:The beauty of this dark chocolate-like roasted malt cream is so psychotropic that my tastebuds soon create a dependance for the weight of its splendour and the splendour of its weight...The muse of this malt museum is voluminous in its scope and luminous in its vision, its dates and figs transgressing the mundanity of its caramel and progressing through the brown rum traps...The sanity of this savoury scene is nourishing and peace-inducing, and rivals with that of Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12 even if it doesnt have that mark of originality and identity the other two possess...4.6/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

The carbonation is quite low, with only a wispy head, when roused it shows a brown color.  Fig dominates the aroma, though it is joined by dark caramel notes, almost a coca-cola type quality, earth, wood, alcohol, brown sugar.  Quite a rich aroma, it is super malty almost like a strong bock.  The beer itself was some what lighter bodied than I was expecting, still rich though with an almost meaty quality to it.  It is fairly sweet with an astringent finish that seems to be a combination of alcohol and yeast character.  Tastes like it has just started to oxidize, perhaps, this adds to the rich maltiness of this brew.  This beer is redolent of dark concentrated fruit; fig, raisin, prunes, and a hint of orange in the finish.  There are some banana and clove notes here as well.

2282,"2003-11-10",3.9,"Dark, dark brown with a hint of black and some red when in the light.Has a strange chocolate and garbage funk to it as well as some subtle bitters.  Don't really notice the alcohol, but dark fruits like plums are there.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"

2282,"2003-10-18",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2007 Re-rate: Dark reddish-brown, body with a small off-white head.  Very sweet aroma and brown sugar flavor.  Many spicy wintery fruits are in this beer, such as figs and raisins.  Heavy maltines with a very clean, finish.  The flavor is filled with grass and herbal notes.  Earthy and very tasty.  Ever-so-slight bitterness lingers, and its very hearty yet refreshing at the same time.  This is a great beer!  I had no idea there was so much alcohol in this one.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
2282,"2003-10-18",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2006 [re-rate - original 4.6 - the 2006 bottled version of this beer lacks the subtle complexities of the 2003 that was my original rating - still a great beer, but not as outstanding - perhaps with some age] Dark crimson, the color of blood, which is appropriate, because Southampton has to have made a pact with some dark forces to consistently make such outstanding beer - sugary sweet aroma, with yeast present, a mustiness, mild fruits and caramel - flavor is very sweet up front, with chocolate and plums being the most evident flavors at first, then some subtle citrus, caramel from the aroma coming in, creaminess, slight roasted flavor toward the end - sticky, malty, sweet finish - I cant detect the alcohol in this at all - it is indeed sad for the entire world that the brewmaster of the Publick House ""doesnt want to get any bigger.""","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2282,"2003-10-02",3.5,"Dark brown with reddish shine; slim white head, gone in seconds. Brett-like nose, slightly phenolic. Both very fruity and yeasty with all the esters. Taste is a sharp combination of bitter (dark malts) and tart sourness which is fruity, like sour grapes or unripe fruit.  Mouthfeel is dominated by both alcohol- and acidburn, diluting the full body a bit. The wild yeast/Brett character sits uneasy upon the big trappist characteristics. Pity, as it deserves better, a lot of the individual characs are right - the combination isn't there - yet, as I'm sure this beer is constantly under development.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2282,"2003-04-03",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2004 750 corked bottle:Dark,oarnge/brown with the slightest,carbonation. Thick,flat,pour. Complex,vinous,airy aroma.Raisins,fig,chocolate,fruity yeast(very evident)and wood.Mouthfeel is very silky,slightly water but at the same time,thick.Thickness increases as you drink.Beginning flavors are highy fruity,lightly sweet with notes of oak and raisin.Chocolate/date-sweetness follows,with some yeast flavors.All leads to a great,bready,sligtly sweet finish. Spicy,yeast flavors are well balanced in the finish and before the finish.The hops are barely,noticable and the alcohol seems to sow it all together,because it doesn't make it seem so thin. The sweet, fruit,and yeast are all balanced very well.VERY drinkable. Great example and well,worth seeking out!Way to go Jeff!","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
2282,"2002-03-04",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2003 2001:  (Overall 5)  Pours with a wonderful creamy head, great lace-work.  Aromas of peaches, strong hops, and caramel.  Explosion of oranges and chocolate initially attacks the taste buds followed by complex coffee and cream. Warming alcohol and a mouth-tingling finish.  An unfrogettable brew.  Revamping the ""5"" rating, as the bottling method has changed this beer dramatically, and is no longer available in 12 oz.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
