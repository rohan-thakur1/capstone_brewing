Little hazy orange to amber beer, small aery off-white to yellow head, little stable, bit adhesive. Aroma: very sweet malts, caramel, very fruity, bit resinous, spicy touch, sugary. MF: soft carbon, medium to full body. Taste: sweet and malty start, spicy, bit sourish, nice bitterness, fruity hops, grapefruit. Aftertaste: bitter, resinous, sweet malts, alcohol, bit cheesy, sweaty feet, caramel. Very good beer, but by no means is this a Sahti/Gotlandsdricke/Koduõlu... More an ipa if anything.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
