652,"2017-05-28",4.1,"Enjoyed on tap at Bells Brewery in Kalamazoo, MI back in February, rating it now because Im bored. I gave it a 4.75/5 on Untappd, but no notes, so I guess it was really good, but I cant remember having this, so Ill take my own word for it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
652,"2016-06-13",3.9,"On tap: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy roasted coffee, light-moderate chocolate, and a touch of cream. Its a dark brown with some faint orange highlights. It has a small beige head that fades to a minimal film outlined by thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate. The finish has moderate coffee with some light vanilla, cream, and a touch of roasted nuts. Its medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation and soft mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
652,"2016-05-28",3.7,"Tap at Clubhouse BFD. Pours black, big tan head. Aroma is lots of coffee. Super roasted. Some lactose, sure, but that coffee pops. Flavor is robust bitter coffee, mouthfeel and sweetness balance it out with that lactose. Yea it goes bitter coffee, really nice sweet milk chocolate, then a little more coffee bitter finish. Really nice. Well done. I expect no less from a Bells Stout.","New York, USA","SG111"

652,"2015-11-01",3.7,"On tap at Bells All Stouts Day. The pour is a medium black with some garnet notes shining through and a thick tan head that falls to a film, leaving some great lace. The aroma is strong on lactose. There is a good milky undertone and a ton of lactose. There is a touch of coffee but for the more part it's dominated by roast and lactose. The flavor is full of lactose sweetness. There is a light roast and some good coffee in it, but the lactose takes center stage the mouth feel is thin and watery, but the carbonation helps it thicken up a bit. The aftertaste is lingeringly roasty with tons of coffee and a solid milky sweetness. Not too shabby

652,"2015-09-13",3.6,"Draft to taster at the Eccentric Cafe. Looks good; a slightly translucent dark cola with thin beige head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells solid; dark malt, coffe roast, and chocolate. Tastes like it smells with a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Enjoyable, and Id love to see it reproduced as an imperial.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
