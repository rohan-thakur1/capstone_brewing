T: Rich, semi-sweet molasses and toffee; raisin, hints of cocoa, some cherry; medium bitterness with a herbal hop flavor; clean, warming alcohol mingles with the rich melanoidin malts, tasting like oatmeal raisin cookies; more toffee and raisin, plus a bit of char, on the finish. P: Medium-full body with medium-high carbonation; finish is medium.

1829,"2017-02-28",3.8,"Well, pardon me, but Im on a review toot and this is my 8th full pour attempt of the day. I enjoy drinking Zywiec porter, an authentic Baltic, and priced locally at $2.50 for 22 oz. Great deal for a very good brew. Und so, the comparisons begin to this Massachusetts made, slightly more expensive copy of the style. It is also a good one.
Actually, at this point in the evening, Im too aswim to form a clear judgement and articulate it. So I will plagiarize from BA... remember, its not plagiarism if you cite your source, as Melania Trump failed to do when she recited Michelle Obamas speech. ""Undated bottle at 42 degrees into a hand washed and dried JK snifter, allowed to warm to 50 degrees. Id have allowed it to warm more, but I was thirstyyyyy.
Aroma  Roasted malt
Head large (Maximum seven cm, aggressive pour), light brown, frothy, diminishing to a three mm frothy ring and partial frothy layer, with some residual foam lacing as the head recedes
Lacing excellent  wide irregular bands of frothy bubbles, mostly tiny but with some small and medium present
Body dark brown/black, opaque
Flavor  mostly roasted malt with a hint of chocolate; no obvious hops, no alcohol, no diacetyl
Palate medium, almost creamy, soft carbonation

A very nice Baltic Porter, slightly on the watery side, lacking the flavor complexity of many others. Hop flavor is absent, true of many other Baltic Porters. This one is so easy drinking that it is almost sessionable, until the 10% alcohol slaps you behind the ear with a sock filled with buckshot. Think Ill have another."" Kudos to Ozzylizard, who has unwittingly helped me out. Here I differ since I dont have another and it is time for bed.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"

Even with a high ABV and (Im guessing) a huge malt bill, it drinks light and crisp.

1829,"2016-08-20",4.3,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, chocolate, roasted malts and coffee.

Appearance:

Opaque black beer with a medium/large head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts with malts, caramel and chocolate; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts and coffee.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. The amount of roasted malts is insane, this is simply an Imperial Stout. We had a sweet one and an almost smoked one, together creating a perfect balance (once again).","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
1829,"2016-06-17",3.5,"This is not a Baltic porter but anyone who cares is dumb. Id say its basically an imperial stout or an imperial porter if you believe such a thing is different than in imperial stout. (Hint: it isnt.) I like this stuff fine. Its got a pretty nice roast grain and chocolate character and is reasonably smooth even though it burns way too much for ten percent. I suppose it is on the lighter bodied side for a big American brew, something along the lines of what youd expect from a well-made Belgian ale of this strength. It is still a bit creamy even though its not too heavy and this helps further bring out the chocolate as well as some cherry/fruity notes. Id say this is definitely above average for a big beer. It is not completely obnoxious but still very flavorful and lends itself to slow sipping w/o being pancake syrup. I will likely never drink this again in my entire life but that goes for all beers so why point it out for this one? I dont know. You tell me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1829,"2016-05-28",3.7,"500 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. Got this in a trade a while back. The pour is a lighter black, light brown color with a thinner cap of light khaki head that falls to a bubbly collar. The aroma is very roasty. Its got the bitterness and heavy roast to go with a light dark chocolate. There is a light molasses and a decent sweetness to it that is pretty appreciated. The flavor is one dimensional. There is a very subdued oxidation up front, but the roast and bitterness really comes charging through. A dark chocolate is present in the back end. Its one dimensional, but its in the right dimension. The mouth feel is excellent. There is a soft carbonation and a nice viscosity. It really clings to the palate and gets a little better as it warms. The chocolate and bitter roast dominate, and thats what tasty in a Baltic.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1829,"2016-05-12",3.7,"Draught at the brewery, 4/23/16.Jesus, these guys put out so many variants Ive never actually taken the time to have the regular version. Finally a chance...Dark, milk chocolate brown with deeper ebony shades and a light tan head atop showing strong retention.Chocolate, very flakey with dark bread and lots of roast. A big caramel character rises up to balance. All of JAs beers are so much softer and approachable lately and I couldnt be happier. Not just another obnoxiously overroasted, overbittered imperial stout/imperial porter/baltic porter, etc.....In the mouth, plenty of dry brown bread balances caramel with milk chocolate and dry roasted notes. Lots of maltiness, with a good attenuation though leaving some residual sugar for body and balance. I dont know if this beer is specifically sweeter because of how much of it gets barrel aged, and maybe its just the placebo effect, but I think it is much better barrel-aged. The malt, chocolate, bread, vanilla, caramel, etc.. really do soak up the tannin and whatever other things are thrown in the barrel. Still, for a barrel aged version to be good, the base beer has to be quite competent. And indeed it is.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs light and refined. Dark chocolate shows a light bitterness in the harshness of how it hits my tongue. Id say nice.

1829,"2015-06-18",4.2,"It make sense that Jacks Abby  a brewery that only makes lagers  would be adept at making a Baltic Porter (which, despite the name, is traditionally a lager rather than an ale). This beer is definitely to-spec in every way and on top of all that its delectable and fun to drink. What more could you ask for?

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. There was no freshness date and it cost $4.95 ($0.41 per ounce).

Appearance: Essentially opaque inky black with blood red highlights. Pours to a large, dark tan, frothy head which retains and laces extremely well.

Smell: Dark grape and dark malt with a general lager scent. Nose is actually rather mild and is probably the beers weakest feature.

Taste: Theres a difference between porters and stouts and theres a difference between Baltic and regular imperial porters  this beer is a good example of that. Sweet to be sure, but not too sweet. Theres a strong sensation of dark malt, but its not dark chocolate, coffee or burnt toast. A smooth, milky sweetness derived from the use of oats in the brew. Brown sugar is used as well (as an adjunct Im assuming), though I think I can taste it in the aftertaste. A quick, distinct, dry hop bite at the apex of the swig offers a nice balance and contrast, though I would not describe this as being a hoppy brew per se. 

Drinkability: I was a little worried that this beer was going to be a challenge to drink consider its pretty strong at 10% ABV. However, I knew it was going to be a breeze after the first sip. The mouthfeel is extremely comfortable with smooth texture and finish to match. There is no heat from the booze; nor does it feel like a beastly brew in any way. Id pair Jacks Abby Framinghammer with dessert or enjoy it as a nightcap year-round.

1829,"2013-12-30",4.1,"The beer pours practically like motor oil, thick and black with just a hint of coffee browness reflecting back at the eyes. It forms a beautiful, dark tan head of creamy, small bubbles that settle around a fingers width above the glass. In body, the beers clarity is hard to discern, seeing as how it is totally opaque. The beer seems thick and viscous, but clear of any particles or cloudiness, but that is just going off of what I saw pour into my glass. On the nose, the beer smells magnificent. Dark roasted coffee with a thick nuance of dark fruits like brown sugar and raisins, plums, and just a touch of sweet cherries. Soft char, and a nuttiness also make their way into the nose, along with spicy licorice. Touches of caramel and toffee do blend in with the coffee as the beer swirls around the glass. On the tongue, the beer tastes initially sweet, but then dries out beautifully into gentle coffee bitters with touches of dark fruitiness, and even a light sense of spice. Acidity is light to nonexistent on the palate. Alcohol is just an afterthought at the end of the sip, providing a light heat and spice to the finish, which is very impressive given the beers 10% ABV. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet bread, but swiftly unfurls into light char, rich coffee, dark and bitter chocolate, and touches of molasses. Burnt raisins and brown sugar come to mind as the sip hits the mid-palate, along with a nice nuttiness that I also found in Jacks Evil Brew, and even a touch of toffee on the finish. In the third quarter of the sip is a burst of spice blending a touch of cinnamon with licorice for a nice burst of flavor. The finish is strong but muddled. The flavoring is peculiarly light with coffee, and brings more spice, light alcoholic heat, and even a touch of cherry into play on the palate. There is even a bit of meaty flavoring on the end of the finish, almost like a Christmas Ham The aftertaste is more expected with roasted malt, coffee, and char lingering on the tongue. I love this beer until the finish, and though it is not awful, the muddling has me confused. In the mouth, the beer feels full bodied and smooth. Velvety carbonation of an above average rate helps to coat the tongue in softness as the beer displays its chewy, yet smooth quality. The mouth is left wet all over with a lingering roast-bitter tingle and a slight warmth in the gullet. Overall, this is a great thick beer that is perfect for sipping in front of a fire. I wasnt quite as fond of it as I was of its barrel-aged variant, mostly because of the oddness of the finish. The flavors are not awful by any stretch, but merely peculiar and out of place with what I was expecting. This is a good beer that gets even better after sitting down in a barrel.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"
1829,"2013-12-30",3.6,"In short: A rich porter on the roasty chocolaty side. Good beer.
How: Growler shared at post HF FoFA 2013 party.
The look: Very dark burgundy (almost black) topped by a small beige head.
In long: Big malty dark caramel nose a bit on the choclaty/cacao side of things. In mouth the beer offers a full sumptuous body with a good carbonation. Taste is rich malts, dark caramel, black chocolate, roast, tobacco leafs. No alcohol presence and sweetness sensation lower than expected. Felt quite drinkable to me for a 10% brew. Good brew for malts lovers. Its kind of sad to think that all the time I spent in my life listening to people talk about the balance of a beer is time I will never get back.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1829,"2013-12-27",3.9,"A very well-made porter. Lagering gives it the silky-smooth mouthfeel that separates this from the more hopped varieties of the style coming from the States. Alcohol is well-integrated. This works.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
1829,"2013-12-23",3.9,"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle. No date of bottling or expiration. The pour is black basically with a long lasting tan head. Those toasted and roasted malt character plays up big in the taste with a little bit of malty note. Slight smoke. Body is medium to full. The taste has a definitive dark malt character with a modest bitterness at the end. Interesting to say the least.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
1829,"2013-09-09",3.8,"Sampled at the brewery. Pours near black with a beige heae. Aroma of roasted, chocolate, and coffee from the malts plus floral hops. Flavor has a nice blend of the malts. The 2013 version was more crisp while the 2012 was mellowed and smooth. Smooth texture. A really good beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
1829,"2013-08-25",3.6,"16oz bottle or whatever size it was. Poured a black color with the consistency of cola with a medium-tan head. Aroma was malty notes, brown sugar, plenty of roasted character. Flavor was malt, caramel notes. A bit boozy, pleasant, but just kind of here.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"

1829,"2013-03-03",4.0,"Draft @ Ward Eight, Lowell  MA. A slighter darker than coca cola with thick, full tan head, that coated the side of the mug on the way down. Nice roasted malts, chocolate aroma, with molasses, and a hint of smoke. The flavor has charred malts at the core, with lots of roasted grain, coffee notes and nice amount of chocolate through the sip. The alcohol isnt apparent at all until just after the swallow. Nice warming on the way down. Medium-bodied but leaning on full. This beer definitely didnt disappoint. Layers of roasted malts. Full of flavor and another great beer from Jacks Abby.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
1829,"2013-02-24",3.8,"Big thanks to Alex for the Growler! Pours a clear dark brown with a with a dark brown head that dissipates to the edges and laces slightly. Aroma has a combination of dark grain and roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. Flavor has more of a combination of roasted malts and dark chocolate that gives a slightly bitter finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
