154,"2017-04-26",3.8,"Draft. During my bachelor party long weekend in the san francisco area, @ SARA. Dark pour with tan head. Roasted, coffee, vanilla and mild yeast tones.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
154,"2016-11-16",4.3,"Draught at Sante Adairius, Capitola, California. Opaque black beer with a nice lasting beige/brownish beer. Coffee aroma, vanilla, chocolate, licorice, figs, caramel, some cream, dark chocolate, some ice coffee. Coffee flavor, licorice, hazelnuts, caramel, sweet fruits, caramel, dark chocolate, raisins, some tar. Amazing porter, not extreme just plain amazing!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
154,"2016-11-10",4.0,"Draft pour on tap at the brewery (Capitola, CA). Pours a deeper darker brownish black hue, firm opaque middle with a bit of chocolatey toasty glow on the edges. Frothy tannish head atop with mellow film, thicker ringer, solid lacing. Aromas are potent, coffee and espresso driven, chocolatey with some vanilla bean appeal, expressive and rich flavors. Cocoa, coffee. Silky black malts, caramel. Delicious stuff on the nose. Initial is medium bodied, a bit fuller with firm coffee, espresso, caramel and toffee. Vanilla bean wafts are sweet and cool, sustain once they hit. A bit bitter, roasty up front moving to a sweeter middle, the vanilla bean taking the reigns. Backend is toasty, bitter, some dry and semi sweet appeal. Lingering coffee roast, earthy appeal, subtle vanilla and sweeter dark depth wafting behind. A very alluring nose, pretty pour, tasty beer that isnt just a treatment vessel. Delicious.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
154,"2016-07-26",4.5,"Tasted from draft at the brewery. Pours cola brown with slightly off white head. Huge coffee aroma! Taste is moderately bitter with nice malt balance. Flavors of coffee, vanilla, a little cocoa and some caramel. Much more vanilla on taste than nose. Awesome Porter.

154,"2015-12-30",4.1,"draft at brewery, for a vanilla beer i liked this one a lot. Dominant coffee, strong vanilla.Roast and the rest are in the back.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
154,"2015-12-29",4.3,"Yeah...what a fantastically smooth and tasty brew. Coffee heavy (but not too much for my taste) with a great malty backbone and a super smooth feel.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
154,"2015-11-20",4.2,"Tap at SARA. Dark opaque pour. Beige head. Intense coffee and vanilla aroma. Sweetness to the taste. Awesome beer.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
154,"2015-08-21",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. It pours dark brown/black with a light tan head. The aroma has huge coffee notes and vanilla creamer. Pretty much what I expected, but it definitely delivers on the potency. Some drier roasted malts keep it honest. The flavor reminds me of an iced coffee with hints of vanilla, marshmallow and roasted malt. A little smoke in the finish. Delicious.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
154,"2015-06-26",4.0,"On tap at the brewery. Black color with tan ring. Aroma is proper coffee, chocolate, some vanilla. Taste is very dry coffee chocolate, a bit dusty, some vanilla. Smooth mouthfeel, feels light with still a full body. I love this one!","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
154,"2015-06-07",3.9,"Draft at SARA. 100th percentile porter? Wait till I get a shot at you. Clear deep mahogany pour with thin ring of white head. No lacing. Aroma: sweetened Vietnamese coffee with vanilla and cream. No fucking way is this a porter. So I have a sip: maybe Im mistaken ... Subdued like a porter, has the texture (thin and watery compared to the beverage the nose evokes, but also reasonable for a porter). Coffee (not at all harsh), sweetness is light to moderate (very much held in check), moderate but balanced bitterness. Texture is a bit chalky in spots; lively-ish carbonation. Lasting smooth coffee finish. Light caramel burps. Overall: Id still have a hard time considering this a porter, but regardless its a pretty fucking tasty coffee-vanilla beer. Would take it over surly coffee variants in a heartbeat (not a knock against them - just trying to anchor this against other experiences).","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
154,"2014-12-16",4.2,"Draft at SARA with Linh. Pours a deep blackish brown body with thin tan lacing. Aroma is rich espresso, coffee bean, vanilla and earthy roast. Incredible nose! Mouthfeel is smooth, rich and creamy with notes of vanilla bean, earthy coffee roast, light chocolate and light malt. A tremendous porter.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
154,"2014-10-25",4.2,"Draft at the source. Pours a deep mahogany. Aroma is fruity espresso, bitter chocolate, brownie, caramel, light cherry, vanilla, oak. Taste is moderately sweet with bakers chocolate, coffee, moderate bitterness, toasted marshmallow. Almond-like nuttiness. Reminds me of Hill Farmstead Earl with an addition of vanilla. Great.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
154,"2014-04-27",4.4,"This beer is awesome. Drank at the brewpub. Pours black with small to medium head that fades to a ring. Aroma and taste are espresso, fudge, vanilla bean, coffee, perfect roast. This porter is fuller bodied, refreshing, and awesome.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
154,"2014-03-22",3.7,"Deep black in color, light tan head... Aroma of fresh roast coffee, vanilla, dark roasted malts... Flavor is roasted coffee, vanilla, dark malts... Mouthfeel is fairly thin... Decent

154,"2014-02-28",3.9,"Pitch black. Not much head to speak of. Loads of fresh coffee and cocoa beans. Almost cookie dough brownie sweetness on the nose. I get oatmeal as well. Take a big gulp of this. Youll thank me. The mouthfeel is bright and full. Bitter raw espresso bean finish. A touch of vanilla but not overpowering. Figs and tree fruit. Coffee is pronounced and generous but not overwhelming.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
154,"2014-02-15",3.4,"On tap at SF beer week event in SJ. Aroma and flavor of vanilla porter, reminded me of Victory at Sea. Possibly less roasty than the former. Good beer.","California, USA","timfoolery"
154,"2013-12-08",3.5,"From the tasting notes. Glass at the tap room. Pours black, thin head. Aroma of roast and vanilla. Taste is roast and muted by vanilla. Pleasantly so. Finish is smooth. All around nice.","Washington, USA","HughConway"
154,"2013-12-03",4.0,"On tap @ Sante Adairius. Just about black in color with a khaki head. Aroma is sweet vanilla, plenty of coffee, and some chocolate and roast. A touch of cocoa powder and caramel. Plenty of sweetness to the flavor with a hint of bitterness. Coffee, vanilla, and lots of chocolate. Roasted malt, a bit of chocolate covered banana, and a hint of caramel.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
154,"2013-11-09",4.1,"On tap at SARA. Poured dark brown, almost black with a small tan head. Nose was complex, vanilla, coffee, little cocoa. This is very easy drinking, sweet , medium bodied, with a nice long aftertaste. Overall a very good one.","La Selva Beach, California, USA","larryLSB"
154,"2013-10-31",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2014 Subsequent batches Ive had havent had quite the sweet/vanilla/coffee-ness as the first batch I had. 3.9 ish 

Wow! Hands down the best porter Ive had. Seriously. A - pours opaque brown with very low head, nice sticky lacing. S - this smells amazing. Vanilla, vanilla ice cream, nice verve coffee. Such a sweet treat. M - light medium body, watery mf with low carb. T - So good! Vanilla beans, vanilla ice cream, and fantastic coffee shine through first (this is better than the coffee you make me, my girlfriend says) a little earthy, some espresso, chalky chocolate, ends a sweetly coffee ice cream float. O - just damn good. 4.4","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"

154,"2013-08-21",4.4,"This beer is truly phenomenal. I tried it this past weekend at the brewery and was blown away. Very coffee and vanilla forward, reminds me a bit of an unspiced, lower alcohol Prairie Bomb!. Looking forward for these guys to keep doing great work.","California, USA","obiwan_k3n00bi"
154,"2013-08-17",4.4,"One of the best coffee porters Ive ever tasted in my life, on tap at the brewery, smelled absolutely delicious just like coffee beans, chocolate notes as well, amazing.","Santa Monica, California, USA","DedicatedToFun"
154,"2013-07-20",4.3,"Pours black with a small light brown head. The head lasts quite awhile and leaves some nice designs on the walls of the glass. The aroma is big on coffee and vanilla. Sweet and richer than expected. Some nice milk chocolate, cocoa. The taste stays well away from anything resembling artificial. Drier than it smells but not harsh. Very well integrated coffee and vanilla. Coffee is probably the dominant flavor. Full mouthfeel. Im not normally a big fan of vanilla stouts/porters (because theyre typically disappointing), but this is excellent. Great coffee flavor with wonderful vanilla.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
154,"2013-03-21",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2013 Full pour at the brewery into a tulip glass. Pours a nitro-like creaminess into the glass. Thick, black with a nice brown fluffy head. Perhaps a bit too carbonated because took a while to settle out before being served to me. Nose is full of crazy fresh coffee beans and a sweet vanilla like pudding. Almost no roast to be noticed here, but chocolate does seem to escape the generous amount of coffee bean smell. Initial flavors of chocolate covered coffee beans, dark chocolate, some nuttiness (not a lot though), and a nice rich vanilla that really adds to the mouth feel of this beer. Soft carbonation, great mouth, not that bitter at all. The coffee and vanilla combo work really well together to keep each other in check, but I would like to see more roast come into play to round out the sweetness. The Joe Chavez is one hell of a coffee beer, but the vanilla plays a great role here.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
154,"2013-03-17",4.4,"Tap. Opaque black with a small tan head and nice lacing. Aroma is strong coffee / espresso, roasted malts, just a touch of vanilla. Flavor is the same, light-plut sweet and lightly coffee bitter with just a bit of astringence. Very rich flavored with the perfect amount of vanilla. Medium body, creamy. Very nice beer.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
154,"2013-01-26",4.2,"On tap at the brewery. 
Aroma is dominated by nice coffee aromas with some complimentary vanilla notes. Some dark bitter chocolate and faint roast also present in aroma. No alcohol or hop notes. Low fruit esters. 
Pours a dark brown to black with dark brown on the edges. Mocha colored head that steadily recedes to the edges. Light lacing and no legs. 
Flavor starts with some nice malt flavors. Dark chocolate and a faint roast character. This quickly mixes with some really nice coffee character and some complimentary vanilla notes. The finish is sweet with some vanilla and dark chocolate. Low bitterness and a faint hop flavor in the finish. Not much ester notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Starts with a nice creaminess. Low but present astringency, seems to be from the coffee more than the malts. Low alcohol warmth. 
Overall this is a really nice coffee porter and the vanilla works really well to cut the coffee notes and keep them from becoming too overwhelming.

154,"2013-01-26",3.9,"On tap at brewer. Black with a fizzy off white head. Aroma and taste of vanilla, drip coffee, chocolate and roasted grain with a lightly bitter coffee finish and a creamy medium to full bodied palate. Nice.","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
154,"2012-08-11",4.3,"On tap at the brewery. Pours blackish brown with a light-tan head. Aroma is lovely creamy vanilla with white sugar and mild chocolate. Flavor is so smooth with heaps of sweet vanilla, a light coffee influence (much more subdued than Joe Chavez), and a nice chocolate rye finish. Mouthfeel really benefits from the Belgian fermentation, making it really creamy.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
