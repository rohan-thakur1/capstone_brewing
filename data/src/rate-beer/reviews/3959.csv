Citrus aroma.

3959,"2011-01-24",3.0,"Bottle at some snooty wine bar. Hazy orange pour with a touch of fizzyness. Dusty citrus aroma, definitely an odd fruit this yuzu. Taste is spritzy and crisp with touches of sweet orange. Meh.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
3959,"2010-08-26",2.1,"(187ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours a lightly hazy yellow body.  Aroma of lemon wafers, orange peel, and orange soda.  Flavor of caramel, lemon, and crackers.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3959,"2010-08-16",3.0,"From a bottle that Craig had brough along to Fairports Cropredy Annual Reunion, 12.08.10, cheers Craig.    Pours cloudy straw colour maybe its more yellowy? Very lemony from the off dangerously squash like and to glugable, bit sacchriney sweet possibly, soft in the mouth and I quite liked it though I would imagine that its not really reflective of a true Sake.

3959,"2010-08-14",3.1,"(167ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear greenish with no alcohol legs. Nose of kiwi, rice, and very alcoholic. Taste of lemon-lime soda, rice, melon, cola-like carbonation with a rice/alcohol finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3959,"2010-08-08",2.7,"Bottle shared by Mora2000.  Pours a watered down greenish yellow.  Aroma is watermelon and candy.  Taste is sweet, with little presence of alcohol.  Reminded me more of a wine cooler or lemon - lime soda.  Not very sake like, but not horrible.","Plano, Texas, USA","Sammer"
3959,"2010-08-02",3.0,"187ml bottle purchased at Central Market in Plano. Pours a light yellow-green color. The aroma is very fruity and I can only assume it is yuzu., The flavor is more of the same with a lot of citrus notes and sugar. Not necessarily reminiscent of a sake, but somewhat enjoyable.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3959,"2010-07-04",2.8,"187 mL Bottle. Pours with a quickly dissipating fizzy head on a hazy peach and yellow. A lighly boozy citrus fruit aroma. Flavors are kind of harsh and kicking. Theres soda-pop and cheap candy-like sugar, that has a vague yuzu, pomelo flavor. Minerals, carbonation, vague alcohols and almost no sake flavor. This is pretty lame shit, but at least it fulfills the infused sake tick, without having to buy damn near a liter of something nobody wants to drink.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3959,"2010-04-08",2.9,"bottle at redlight redlight.  pours light cloudy yellow.  fizzy.  honey, blossoms, and an earthiness to the nose.  Very sweet with the citrus coming to the foreground and the alcohol elements complimenting it better in the flavor than the nose.  fairly refreshing.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"
3959,"2010-04-08",2.9,"Sweet citrus on the nose, grapefruit with hints of lime.  Pours a slightly hazy greenish orange with soda-like bubbles.  Sweet citrus, sweet grapefruit, reminds me a little of the soda Fresca.  Lemon and orange notes as well with a spiciness hiding in the back somewhere.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
3959,"2010-03-29",2.0,"Clear bottle from Nugget Market in Vacaville, CA.  Pours rather pee color with a few bubbles. Definite citrus aroma. Sweetish. Light body; mild carbonation. Flavor is like salty citrus aid. Or like salty cool aid. Underlying flavor is nice, but overall its not great.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3959,"2010-02-18",2.3,"18.7 cL clear bottle. Pours pale and unclear yellow with a shortlived white head. Aroma is citric and mild peachy. Citric and vague sugarish sweet underneath. Citric and sweet finish. Sake radler.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
3959,"2008-10-01",2.5,"Somewhere between Sunddy D and Ecto cooler in color. Greenish yellow with orange highlights. Nose is seltzer, citrus, and dirt. Taste is slightly ricey but is carbonated and somewhat fake. I don’t really know what to say other than that this is not good.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
3959,"2008-08-26",2.3,"Bottle: Pours a hazy beige yellow color without any retention in the head. Small carbonation. The nose is a bit odd with some musky koji notes, sweet sticky orange and lemon notes with a little banana. The flavor is sweeter with a medicinal note in the finish, not too acidic but the sweeter orange notes are there. Almost like candy with a funky koji booze tail. Not as great as the Green Tea.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3959,"2008-07-02",1.5,"Pours a slightly hazed lemony yellow color with a short fused head that rests to nonexistent. I can smell the earthy bamboo sake amidst a citrusy orange backdrop. Light  with good carbonation. Defined orange citrus yielding the classic sake characteristics although mildly. A disturbing blend of jolly rancher orange and some cheap Junmai earthiness. Theres some acidity to linger on the palate for balance, some balance. Not my cup of tea.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
3959,"2008-05-07",2.5,"Sent in a photo to be uploaded. Slightly cloudy electric yellow colored. Aroma of earthyness, kumquats, and orange peel. Taste is cloying citrus. It is like biting into a cane sugar covered orange (peel and all). Carbonated.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
