Szerkezete kezdetben kissé éles, közepesen szénsavas, idővel azonban kedvemre való módon csitul, így lesz szinte tökéletes. Ízletes komlóbomba, néhol mézédesnek ható gyümölcsös jegyekkel, amiket remekül egyensúlyoznak a tartalmas, grapefruitos kesernyével játszadozó markáns árnyalatok.

Not sticky but perfect thickness for an IPA.

Na krawędziach szkła można zaobserwować rzeszę pajęczych sieci.
Rewelka! 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest kosmiczny! Świeży, rześki, obłędnie intensywny owocowy aromat. Dominują owoce cytrusowe wsparte o minimalną bazę w postaci tropików. W nosie czuć świeżo zerwane z drzewa mandarynki, ananasy, pomarańcze, limonki, czy grejpfruty. 
Na drugim końcu tylko kapka marakui i mango.
Na równoległej płaszczyźnie zabójcza porcja nut leśnych, żywicznych, iglastych.

Goryczka jest dokładnie w punk. Nie jest ani za krótka, ani za wysoka. Znika jeszcze przed kolejnym łykiem.
Pozostawia krótkotrwały wytrawny, grejpfrutowy posmak w ustach. Tekstura piwa jest półpełna, nagazowanie średnie.

3850,"2017-01-01",4.1,"Yields a bright citrus pulp yellow color, utterly hazed, with a big, foamy white head.

Smells of a citrussy juiciness, with lots of blood oranges, kiwi, passion fruit and woodruff jello. The citrus is very well pronounced though and maintains a prominent crispness on the nose, which definitely creates a juicy impression, but with a nice, perfumy depth to it. 

Drinks great, silk on the tongue, with a creamy, light mouthfeel and subtle, only slightly sparkly carbonation. Utmost juicy during the beginning, remarkably dry in the finish, with a very pleasant transition in between.

Offers citrus peel from the start, a hint of passion fruit, guave and sugared white bread malts. Focussed on the lemon though, with a sweet mid palate, in which the malts cut easily through. As soon as they came up, the malts vanish and open up the palate to a great citrussy finish. This turns out to be utmost bitter and long lasting, with just enough orange juice to remember the beers intial qualities and to add a nice, bright depth to the dryness.

Awesome twist between New England and West Coast IPA with a very juicy nose. Bitter, bright finish and a welcomed malt sweetness in between. Very versatile for its abv, as well as pungent in all its well working facetts - a treat.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3850,"2016-11-16",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2016 (33 cl bottle from Kihoskh; Batch #567; BBD: 19.06.2017) So assuming Stigberget marks their IPAs with BBD six months after production this one would have been bottled on December 19th making it 11 days old upon imbibement. This one was poured in a (rinsed) Rochefort goblet at fridge temperature revealing a cloudy golden body with just one finger of white head that recedes leaving film and beautiful lace. I actually had this one on tap at Himmeriget just yesterday when I had the chance to compare it side by side with Alefarm Fir. I recognise here the relatively sharp citrus / grapefruit juice note that cuts through the hopforward juicy NE IPA aroma. Perhaps there is a bit of onion / sweat in there too. Quite crisp on the palate, light body, soft carbonation and a crisp and somewhat tart finish that makes you think of lactic acid perhaps. I dont know how old the Fermentoren batch was when I had it but it seemed a bit more fruity aromawise.
Original rating from November 16th 2016 (A: 8; Ap: 4; Fl: 8; Pa: 4; O: 16) 
(on tap @ Fermentoren) Poured at fridge temperature into a shaker reveals a cloudy golden body with one finger of white head. Good retention and beautiful lace. Aroma is beautifully hopforward with notes of tropical fruit juice as well as hints of peach, mango and onion. Oily texture, medium body, soft carbonation and a lingering, pleasantly aromatic finish. Flavour has plenty of aroma notes and par for the style of New England IPA the bitterness remains subdued in favour of drinkability. This is a very successful implementation of my favourite beer style and I can only hope that Stigberget manages to continue producing beer like this regardless of whatever contractual arrangements may be in place. Ill definitely be looking out for the Amazing Haze as well!","DENMARK","humlelala"

The taste is mildly hoppy with soft sweet fruits and a lightly bitter juicy finish and a slightly bitter, yet still fruity, aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fairly light and everything is highly quaffable.

3850,"2016-04-15",4.6,"Draught @ The Rover. Pours very hazy deep yellow with a small creamy white head that leaves some spotty trace and sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is heavy fruity and heavy grassy with crackers, grapefruit juice, fleshy mango, fleshy papaya, passion fruit, star fruit, freshly cut grass, pine needles, grape skins, lemon zest and hints of diesel fuel and weed. Taste is tiny sweet, slightly bitter, fruity and grassy. Mouthfeel is slightly soft, tiny dry, tiny astringent and medium bodied. Finish is slightly bitter with crackers, grapefruit, yellow tropical fruits, fresh grass and pine. Shit! Smells like a Tree House / Trillium / Hill Farmstead IPA. Looks like and tastes like that too.
