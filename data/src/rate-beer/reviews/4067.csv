>>> Highly enjoyable hoppy [gently] sour with a flavor profile dominated by citrus/orange and backed by some nice funk. Lovely.

-  Cloudy orangey with a medium white head, medium retention and some lacing. 
-  Theres a burst of citrus and passionfruit carried by a mild to moderate acidity. 
-  The hoppiness is gentle, but fits really well with the citrus profile. 
-  Theres a mild but interesting funk presence in the background along a touch of buttery oak (not in a bad way). 
-  Body is medium, carbonation is moderate and the finish is rather dry. 
-  Super easily drinkable and quenching despite/because of the sourness. 

Flavors:  Citrus/orange (lots), passionfruits, mild funk, buttery oak, mild herbalness.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
