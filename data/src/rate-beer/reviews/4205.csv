4205,"2015-12-26",3.6,"Tap. Pours clear chestnut, small tan head, some lacing. Aroma is malty, dark breads, molasses and toffee. Flavor is medium sweet, light bitter, heavy dark malts. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
4205,"2013-03-14",3.0,"Tap at OF.  Sweet, sugary, amateur hour experiment.  Overly sugary sweet, brown chocolate intensity.  Pretty insipid, almost embarrassingly subpar.  Taste like malt syrup.  No balance, just sweet malt.  Not all our bad, just not good.  Numbers seem generous.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4205,"2011-12-01",3.1,"On tap at the Old Fashioned.  Deep brown, mahogany.  A little roast, but mostly toasted and Munich malts.  Flavor is some mild dark fruits and a hint of roasted malt.  A bit of an odd acidic middle/finish.  Other than that, just okay.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
4205,"2011-11-06",3.7,"Listed as 6.1%.  I didnt create a new beer for this, as its pretty likely the recipe didnt change.  This beer was the highlight of the beer drinking day.  There were lots of sweet Munich malts that left me wanting more.  Robust flavor of caramelized malts, subtle chocolate, and simple light hopping.  The palate was clean and ""lagery"".","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4205,"2009-06-27",3.3,"An old rating, courtesy of Skyview. Grain aroma. Smooth on the palate, and more flavor unprocessed grain with some carmelized sugar. Black, and just hint of grain sourness.  Not as heavy on the palate as some bocks, but good anyway.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
4205,"2008-03-01",3.7,"Growler courtesy of Skyview.  This was delicious.  Dark shiny brown pour with a small head.  Caramel malt aroma.  The sweet caramel malt comes through again in the flavor as well as a light bisquit.","Coralville, Iowa, USA","KAF"
4205,"2008-02-17",3.9,"On draught at the brewpub in Wisconsin Dells. Pours a clear dark copper brown brew with a creamy off-white head that quickly dissipates to a fine ring. Aroma of dark caramel malt, some light chocolate, flowery hops, a touch of pumpernickel and dark fruits. Taste is medium to full bodied, light carbonation with fruity flavors of dark pitted fruits, roasted dark malt, a touch of dark chocolate and a light coffee character. Finish is creamy and very malty of dried dark malt along with a semi-sweet fruit aftertaste that slowly disappears after the finish. The three month aging really smoothed out the beer texture and flavor quite well.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

4205,"2005-07-25",3.4,"Tap: dark golden/amber with wispy head. Lots of sweet malt up front, in the aroma. Flavor is all sweet caramel malt. Pleasantly surprised.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
4205,"2005-04-18",3.4,"Dark red color with a thin head.  Sweet malt aroma.  Solid malt and caramel hit in the flavor.  Slightly bready.  It kind of dies at the finish, but still one of their best ones.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4205,"2005-04-17",3.1,"Brick Red Coloring with White Ring.  Sweet Malt and Hops Aroma...With a Crisp Dryness to it.  Rich Malt on the Tongue....Bread Dough...Sweet Up to the Aftertaste...Ends Dry and Hoppy with the Flavor Dropping Out.  Good Start with a Poor Finish.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
4205,"2003-09-30",4.1,"Brownish red color, with a nice malt scent. Caramel and cinnamon were the flavors that stood out to me (two things that I notice a lot in beer, to be honest), but this was a nice complex tasting beer. Easily the highlight of the day.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"
4205,"2003-02-17",3.2,"Clear brown with a nice tight bubbled tan head.  Clean sweet caramel bock aroma.  Initial malt sweetness followed by a stale stale oak, peat and tobacco flavor.  The aroma far outdoes the flavor on this one.  Once again fizzy in feel.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
