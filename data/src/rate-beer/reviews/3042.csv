3042,"2015-09-03",3.8,"This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a nice looking hazy dark amber to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than about forty seconds. Lacing was gripping nicely to the glass.
The smell started off with a sharp sweet citrus rolling over tobacco notes and a light sticky caramel and slight toffee. 
The flavor was semi-sweet with a strong sticky dry tobacco to caramel maltiness running into slight toffee tones. A dry caramel to toasty toffee aftertaste leads to a quick dry sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping quality about it. Carbonation runs really low key allowing the ""tobacco"" to harsh toffee tones to be the bitter balance that runs the gamut on my tongue.
Overall, this was a really nice American Barleywine that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Flavor is toffee, some fig (or maybe raisin), honey, little bit of orange and lemon peel, a delayed citrus hop finish. Really exactly what youd expect from a Victory Barleywine with 2 years on it.

Smells sweet with a little something lurking behind it. Appearance is an easy 5. Beautiful amber color with a bright white head of foam that recedes down to nothing instantly. Taste is boozier and hoppier than the aroma and appearance would suggest - this is a big boy, for sure. The aftertaste belies some of the brown sugar sweetness, but it also brings a pretty substantial alcohol burn. This could have used even more aging than the 18 months.

3042,"2015-02-23",4.2,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter. Wood and peach aromas start off strong, but fade. The mellower wood remains and combines with sweet citrus and floral notes as well as spiced apple cider. Aromas of caramel come on strong and late. The beer is slightly hazy and effervescent. It gets hazier near the bottles end, but retains an oily appearance. The hue is a honey copper copper topped by a fuzzy, foamy, off-white thick ring with a heavy, dusty surface coating, and it leaves an above average, dense lace. The taste is a medium high sweet and medium high bitter; mostly balanced, but perhaps slightly more bitter than sweet. The foamy carbonation cuts through the viscous texture nicely. The medium full body holds citrus and caramel sweetness, with resin and burnt bitterness, and a subtle candy sugar note.

Rich and sweet with toffee, peach, hints of dried fruit, a brandy-like booziness that fits fine. Strong, lasting bitterness with bitter oranges. Still pretty hoppy. Like it a lot now, certainly has the structure to go a few years but maybe the malt side of things is not interesting enough to dominate the show. Nothing fancy, just very good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

Anyway, aged bottle review - bottle still has some life, which is a good thing - dank brown pour with no head to speak of - thin white ring clings to the edges. Aroma is inviting - loads of caramelized malt, some resinous hop notes, hint of chocolate, toasty, some booze, splash of dark fruit. Flavor is smooth and sweet - caramelized, toasted malts rule the show, but there is still a healthy amount of hop bitterness to make this an excellent barleywine after all the years. Dark fruit and some spices round things out. Palate is somewhat oily, moderately thick, and oxidization is minimal.

3042,"2014-03-02",3.6,"Ive been looking forward to this for a while. 22 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a clear dark amber color. The head is a two finger off-white shade. Its texture is excellent, and it has good retention as well. Lacing left behind is rather plentiful.

S: Its actually not quite as sweet as I thought it would be. The hop notes here - as expected - are piny and resinous, balanced by its malt sweetness. In particular, it brings caramel, vanilla, and toffee. Its definitely a quality aroma, if a bit more standard than I was expecting.

T: The taste works better, I think. Piny hops hit the palate first - there isnt much harshness, and the pine flavor is incredibly vivid. It becomes sweeter after the midtaste and especially on the finish, while its hop flavor becomes almost salty to my twisted palate. The harsher elements of the alcohol are hidden very well. If I have to complain about something, its that the sweetness here isnt well defined - sure it brings plenty of caramel, toffee, and earth, but not much in the way of dark fruits or candy. Theres just the subtlest suggestion of the latter, unfortunately it isnt quite enough. Every once in a while, theres a gentle wisp of chocolate that hits the palate.

M: This seems to be even softer than others in the style. Of course, being a barleywine, its still sweet and heavy. The finish is, naturally, superbly long and mildly bitter. Its more salty than anything. Nonetheless, Im really impressed how well the booze is hidden.

O: Give this a year or two in the cellar and this would kick ass. Right now, though, its still drinking pretty damn well. If the sweetness was more defined, then it would be killer immediately. As it stands, Im really enjoying the hop profile but wished the malt component worked a little better.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Taste is predominantly a candied sweetness and strong malt with some hops in the background but they are overpowered. Medium to full bodied with a somewhat dry finish.

3042,"2014-02-21",4.1,"This poured a brick orange color with a slight haze and soft light that exudes form the body of the beer. A fat off white head of orange tinged foam to top the beer and it fell lazy like it had all day and left great lace and alcohol legs. Nose is fantastic. Its candied orange peel, malty caramel with a bit of nut and butterscotch, fresh orange to go with that and a little bit of hop presence. 

Taste is all that and more. The caramel is smooth and buttery with a hint of nuttiness. The fruits are lively and fresh with a bit of fresh orange to really juice things up. The malt sweetness has something buttery on ti and that is like candy. The mouthfeel is full and sticky and has a bit of pine resin to coat the throat and let the solvent like alcohol just graze your palate before the finish.

Best by: 11/15/15

A: Pours a nice orange, amber ale with excellent clarity and a single finger peanut colored head which dissipates quickly to leave a sheet of foam on surface.

S: Bell peppers dominate the nose initially. Some green apple skins, caramel, toffee, earthy hops with hints of citrus in there.
Occasionally, I get some woody smells in there, piney, resin.

T: Bitter, sweet, warm. Plenty of bittering on this barley wine. Nice, sweet malt backbone, but it doesnt really marry completely. the ABV show through (expected at this age).

M: Medium heavy feel with medium high carbonation. Slicks the palate. 

D: nice beer. I was caught off guard by the nose profile on this one. Its atypical for a barley I think. The bell pepper is what I like in young, immature Cabernet Franc vines, and this reminds me of this profile. I want to grab a couple and age them.

3042,"2013-12-23",3.6,"It appears that Ive wiped the dating off, but this is from the fresh 2013 release.
Appearance: The body is beautifully clear with a red body with pink tones through it. The head is short and dense with good retention, slowly settling into an off-white dusting on top with a bubbly ring.
Aroma: The nose gives off juicy grapefruit hop aromas, but its not pungent while hints of sweet caramel and bready malts back it up with a light booze presence. The aroma is a bit weak though.
Taste: The intro is very unassuming of the mildly aggressive bitterness that awaits. Bready malts and a mild caramel presence act as a base for a strong floral and grapefruit bitterness that peaks on the finish and lingers for a while. I get some raisin undertones by the finish, slight musky aromas as well. I didnt remember this being so hoppy.
Palate: Full-bodied and moderately carbonated, a bit snappy on the finish.
Overall: Im not sure how I feel about this beer. On one hand I find it to be a step above most American barleywines, and on another hand I find that American barleywines teeter on being a imperial IPA. I tend to like my barleywines in the English style, sweet with a complex malt base. I dont get much here other than a huge hop presence, especially by the finish.

3042,"2012-09-21",3.9,"1/16/2010 - A little alcohol goes a long way on a shivering, cold winter night. It reasons that a lot of alcohol goes an even longer way, and better used for even more frigid evenings. This bottle of Victory Old Horizontal was deployed for one of those well-digging cold nights, and it suited the climate very well. Caramel colored with gradients of red and brown, muddy, and nothing on top but a light gray fuzz, the Old Horizontal pours a ponderous beer. The aroma is thick and clotted with chocolate, chalk, a pleasant edge of alcohol, and freshly chopped almonds and hazelnuts - almost as if the brewers added a tablespoon of Nutella to each bottle. The taste features the same menagerie of chocolate and nutty flavors, but the alcohol really shines here, poking through the dark chocolate haziness. The aftertaste is short, begging the drinker to take another sip to garner that addicting chocolate and Nutella flavor, but the alcohol tempers the pace. The hazelnut makes this brew special. but I also appreciate how a high alcohol content, for once, enhances the beer, rather than spoiling its other virtues.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Solid barley wine that was fairly consistent across the board, although I did prefer the 2006 and 2008 to the 2005.

3042,"2011-03-11",4.6,"Aroma: smelled like someone was making caramel in the kitchen.
Appearance: Dark Amber Clear, Head was light color and didnt last long. 
Taste: This is where it got interesting. I bought a six pack because a rep at a liquor store told me it was pretty good. I had never heard of this beer but Id tasted the V-12 and love that one. So I gave it a try. I took my first sip and was blown away. This beer was a perfect standard of a barleywine style. Even for being fresh and not aged, it was perfectly balanced and well rounded out with the perfect amount of hops and malt. Not too sweet up front like the smell suggested. The finish was a bit sweet but that didnt linger too long. Just went right for the next sip!
Palate: Mouth feel was big and malty, but refreshing with slight citrus overtones from the hops.
Overall: This is one of my newest favorites! The new gold standard for Barleywines!","River Falls, Wisconsin, USA","The_Lee_Man"

Pours an orange-tinged ruby with a small head, lacing is fairly mimimal at first and completely gone within 10 minutes. Aroma is dark, dried fruits, and a ton of resiny, earthy hops.  Palate is very sweet up front and quite bitter on the finish. Interesting contrast, with most of the maltiness lending itself towards the dark fruit, rum, and some mild toffee flavors, braced against the bold hopping. Theres not a lot of complexity, and I found the hoppy finish along with the simple sweetness to really become a bit grating as the glass wore on. Maybe some age would settle this one down?

3042,"2011-02-05",5.0,"Theres a barely discernable ""Enjoy By"" date on the front label by the moon. ""Enjoy By"" 2014 is a candidate for the holy grail; it is perfect and mind-blowing and there is nothing better...cloudy nectarine color, beautiful when you hold it to the light; rich carmel-y, nutty bread dough and pine complexity finishing into something completely different from where it started. ""Enjoy By"" 2015 is completely average...darker in color and clear, the rich complexity and butterscotch-ness isnt there, and its therefore a short-lived trip. This is a bottle conditioned ale that lends itself to cellaring, so in 12 months time, will ""Enjoy By 2015"" morph into what ""Enjoy By 2014"" is now? Maybe. But its hard to imagine it transforming itself to that extent. Buyers Guide: If it appears cloudy in the bottle and the yeast is stacked at the bottom, buy in mass.

Up front I get a slight bitterness followed by classic heavy and sweet raisin, malt, and a somewhat dry booze finish enveloped in caramel.

The hop malt balance is satisfying (and especially so in that Victorys tendency towards a brusque hops profile is admirably restrained), and as the brew warms the malt defines itself more so as caramel and a pleasing bitterness emerges in the finish.

2/07/2010:  Victory Old Horizontal Barleywine Style Ale...  Aroma:  Lovely caramel and toffee, brown sugar, ample hops that make their presence known and set expecations, but dont dominate; smells a lot like sugary pineapple upside down cake!  Appearance:  Golden-orange color with a deep ivory-colored head that receeds to leave a percolating crown; semi-opaque liquid.  Flavor:  Rich, somewhat sweet toffee that melts in your mouth followed up with a fairly substantial hop flavor (aged vague citrus peel, earthy, subdued floral, aged dried fruit like golden raisin and alcohol-soaked apricots) and moderate bitterness as well as a pleasing amount of warming alcohol (brandy-like).  Palate:  Milky texture but silky smooth going down.  Overall:  In a word, excellent (for an American-style barleywine)!  I like the sweet, sticky maltiness as well as the peppery hop bite that attacks in the finish; this beer has held up wonderfully!

3042,"2010-03-09",4.0,"12oz bottle, best by october 2013, so Im assuming its a year and five months in the bottle at this point.   Plays the barley wine part well in appearance with a deep amber to red and brown hue, capped by a small beige head.   The aroma has richly sweet malt, caramel, brown sugar, fruity alcohol, orange marmalade on toast, and actually has some fruity and piney hops in there after all this time.   The flavor immediately shows some mellowing of the considerable bitterness that this stuff has fresh.   You can tell that there was a lot of alpha acid in this fresh, but a large portion of it has dropped off,   Richly malty with lots of toasty grain, and an ample sweetness, though not cloyingly sweet.   What bitterness is left still balances the big malt sweetness well.   There is a touch of apricot fruitiness and warming alcohol as well.   Full bodied with a clean and smooth feel.   Creamy carbonation.   This seems like a good age for this beer, as the balance between the hop bitterness and malt is pretty good right now.   Still some fresh hop character remaining though, which adds some nuance.   I can see this going quite a bit longer, but this is a very good for style American barley wine right now.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

I still stand by the aroma leading to a lighter style (less robust than most bwines).

Dark golden brown liquid with ruby highlights. Small creamy tan colored head of foam. Okay retention and okay lacing.

Big malty nose. Smells like buttered caramel. A little bit of brown sugar and vanilla. Slight hint of candied apricots. Very slight hint of earthy hops.

Nice caramel malts are out front. Hints of buttered bread with peach preserves. Toffee. Slight kiss of hops. Not prominent, though. Slight earthy spiciness.

Fairly light bodied for a barleywine style, I think. But, maybee thats just me. It is smooth and creamy, though, and thats a plus.

Again, hop character is high, yielding citrus and nectar. Palate is thick, silky, velvety, and rich.

Flavor is delicious; starts with caramel sweetness with supplemental notes of raisin, wine, nectar fruit, and even a bit of roast. The second half of the flavor has a really nice hop character with a dry, bitter citrus note, followed with a bit of grain and definite booze at the finish.

dark hazy copper colored pour capped by a small beige head which leaves behind some sporadic clumps of lacing. 

initial spicy hop smell gets followed up with honey, lightly toasted grain, flowers, dried apricots, really earthy spice akin to cinnamon and something minty-like maybe birch which numbs the sinus... perhaps it is the alcohol but it never disappears as the alcohol shows up when warm.

the palate is sweet but nowhere near cloying. there is a nice bitterness throughout the flavor profile... which are... flowers, toasty grain, caramel, toffee and a beautiful spicy hoppy finish when it is cellar temperature. as it warms it shows notes of malt powder, vanilla, mellow orange, non resinous pine and some cocoa butter. alcohol becomes slight but it is welcome and warming. nothing seems out of place (like fresh bw can tend to be too hoppy/sweet/resiny or old examples which tend to be bland or oxidized)... its at a great age!

medium body is rich yet spicy. bitterness from hops and dryness from the alcohol offset the creaminess and smooth mouth feel from the low carbonation. incredibly well balanced with great drinkability... i cant wait to taste the rest of the case! 9/4/9/5/18/4.5","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

Smells of bready caramel and a hint of dark fruit.

The taste is originally caramel and very malty. The alcohol then comes in and balances out the maltyness. There is a slight hint of fruit, but it is not substantial. A caramelized malt taste in the finish raps this one up.

The mouthfeel is rather hefty and syrupy but not unpleasant. Carbonation is done well.

This is definitely a sipper. I couldn’t put this one down too quickly, which is a good thing. The 11% is hidden rather well and took me by surprise about half way through since I was so eager to finish the glass. Another excellent Victory brew.

3042,"2008-11-20",3.8,"12oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazy, deep brownish red with a rather thick and long-lasting light brown head. There is a good bit of sediment in the bottle that, upon sneaking into the glass, appears quite chunky - clods of dirt floating around. The aroma is viscous and vinous with thick sticky malts, caramel, spices (peppery phenols), and dark fruit. The flavor starts bittersweet with lots of tangy, caramelly, fruity malts and a zip of spicy hops. A rather pungent and earthy hop bitterness wraps itself around the sides of the tongue and all over the back of the tongue, accentuating the spicy perception. A subtle sting from carbonation along with warming ethanol further enhance the perception. At mid-palate, the strong and sweet malts blend excellently with fruity esters and a firm, clean hop bitterness to give impressions of bitter fruit dipped in dark chocolate. The beer finishes somewhat dry with a spicy, sticky-toffee-sweet malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth. The presence of ethanol and crisp carbonation is quite noticeable across the tongue, but combines with the full body to form creamy and slippery waves of sudsy brew. Overall - a fine barleywine - very strong and malty but well-balanced, too.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

3042,"2008-10-30",4.2,"My very first barleywine was from Flying Dog and at the time I didn’t even realize what it was, much less what a barleywine was. That was then and this is now, and whenever possible, I seek out barleywines. They are often higher in the ABV and best savored in a goblet or chalice glass of sorts so as to breathe and acclimate just a bit to room temperature. They can also age well and are a treat both fresh and after a few years. After having experienced the wonder that was the Old Horizontal from Victory Brewing, I have no doubts that she can be savored both fresh and with a few years of wisdom under her cap.

Old Horizontal poured a thick cloudy brown with small hints of dark earth and burnt amber. A huge head of dark tan foam tops off my glass and almost flows over the sides. As she seeks refuge in her brew below, thin trails of brussels lace remain. Each swirl of my glass produces a soft head and produces a ripe nose of apples and apricot, lemon, nutty malts and a hint of sweet caramelized sugars with a flourish of warm spices. With such an impressive nose, I am even more eager to taste. Her body is thick, creamy and soft, with a hint of bubbly effervescence. A soft entrance to mask the onslaught of barleywine warmth and explosion of flavors lurking behind. Chewy, sweet and heavy with malts and caramelized sugars. Hints of spiced apples and ripe apricots which tingle on the top of my tongue. Her finish is clean and sweet with a growing aura of warmth. An alcohol warmth lingers during all of my dreamy quaffs, drawing out the spices and sweet malt profile while adding an extra kick to the lemon citric finish. Unfortunately, before I know it my glass is empty and I am left wanting more.

Old Horizontal from Victory Brewing is perfectly balanced with just enough warmth and bitter nip in the finish to balance our her sweet and dark malty profile. While I enjoy a more hoppy and hot barleywine just as much, there was something special about Old Horizontal which left me wanting another. If I had regular access, she would be a staple in my fridge.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3042,"2008-08-11",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2009 Bottle.  Pours a copper brown, with little head, and a (somewhat off-putting) thick floating yeast sediment.  Aroma is malt and yeast, with a bit of fruit sweetness, and a slight metallic tinge.  The flavor is very nice - dark fruits, brown sugar, and caramel, with a slight hoppiness in the finish.  The 11% ABV gives the beer a nice warming bite, without being overpowering.  An excellent barleywine, though a tad underwhelming, given its phenomenal ratings.  A bit more hops would balance the beer nicely.

UPDATE: Added 2 points to the overall impression score, as I just cracked open one of these that had aged for ~6 months, and it was phenomenal - much more flavorful, drinkable, and well-balanced.","Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","TOSG55"
3042,"2008-08-01",4.7,"Wow, this is one amazing barleywine.  I was happy to find it on a road trip and my only regret now is not buying a lot more.  Pours a reddish brown color, some haze to it, and a thick tan head with some really nice staying power.   Aroma is quite fruity with pine, caramel, sugars, alcohol and it all creates a wonderful scent.  This is a nicely hopped barleywine but not over the top allowing so many other flavors to play a major role.  Toffee, brown sugar, sweet candy malt, grapefruit and pine hops and even light traces of darker fruits.  Really well done.  Warming but the 11% is hidden with very little alcohol sting.  This can compete with any barleywine out there.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

3042,"2008-07-30",4.3,"One of my all-time favs. Dark luscious caramel color. The aroma consists of a wild combination of nearly every fruit found in the western hemisphere. Going down, it is seductively sticky. The array of sweet fruits becomes apparent and the alcohol performs its warming effect. At about that time, it becomes obvious that this is an excellent barley wine. Not at all overpowering, but not for the weak.

Well rounded flavors of pale malts, vanilla caramels, brown sugar, orange, and a bit of herbal hops. Heavy and slightly sweet upfront, but a nice drying bitterness.

After my first sip, my initial impression was yuck!  Sharp bitterness that didn’t quite hide the super sweet malt.  But as the beer warmed and my palate adjusted, it got a lot better.  The rich malt gets tastier and less cloying, the bitterness recedes.  A heavy beer but not syrupy.  Alcohol finish.  The ~7 or 8 months of aging didn’t seem to improve this beer: either it’s best after 2+ years or just fresh.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"

Anyways, this beer remains a very fine one, a favorite American barleywine for me. On the pour it looks like nice amber, trending ever so slightly to brown, with impressive carbonation. The notes are mildly fruity with a bit of sweet malts. Still a bit hot, amazingly enough, though not so much that it interferes with the complex flavors. Some bite from the hopes, sweet sugars, and a lovely combo of tobacco and bitter herbs round out the finish. Delish!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

3042,"2008-06-24",4.0,"Pours a deep copper color with a red hint.  Has a small beige head on it that lingers for a few minutes, but is gone shortly.  A touch of fruity banana in the aroma, with a good bit of floral hops.  Brown sugar and raisins.  Still smells a little bit hot.  Some time would probably do it well.  The flavor is a creamy roasted caramel with some sweet toffee and a little fruit.  Definitely has an alcohol presence, but not that overpowering for 10%.  A slight hop bitterness that is kind of surprising but balances out the intense sweetness nicely.  The hop character is almost a peach cotton candy.  The body is excellent with a very thin carbonation, but a palate like half and half.  Leaves a slight bitterness and warming alcohol on the tongue.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"

3042,"2008-06-04",3.7,"Pours a clear, reddish-orange color.  A rocky, spongy, cream colored head settles slowly to a wispy film.  Random, spotty lacing marks the glass.  Aromatics include a malty, yeasty base of caramel, toffee, toasted bread, dark raisons, and prunes.  Hop scents come off as primarily faded citrus, with almost an orange marmalade sort of sweetness.  Flavors are rich, with caramel and candy sugar being spiced with bittersweet orange peel, raisons, and vodka soaked prunes.  There is not nearly as much hoppiness as I expected, but it is decently balanced by the bitter citrus notes.  The mouthfeel is nearly full and smooth, but leaning towards the syrupy side of things.  A touch of alcoholic heat leaves a tingle on the way down.  Overall, its a really good beer, but its not world class by any means.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3042,"2008-05-13",3.8,"12 oz bottle. Aroma of waxy green leaf and light fruits and caramel. Amber color with ruby in the depths. A beige head went up and down. Full bodied with coarse carbonation. Flavor is caramel/toffee sugar with strong, yet subtle, light stone fruit flavors. Heat goes down the throat. Finish is far from dry, and its even a little sticky, yet it does not come across as sticky sweet. Seems to be some hop bitter. Not enough to balance, but enough to render it drinkably pleasant. Theres a whole lot of flavor going on.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3042,"2008-05-13",4.0,"Listed as 11%. Served it a bit too cold (52* or so). Pours with a smallish, foamy, light brown head covering a hazy amber body. Head goes pretty quick. Some lacing, as well as alcohol legs left on the glass. Aroma has some unnatural element to it (either plastic or plywood), but following that there are currants, berries, toffee and maybe even coffee malts. First thing to notice upon drinking is how creamy-syrupy the mouthfeel is. Quite nice. Flavor has lots of alcohol, and then is quite a bit more malty towards the finish than other barley wines that I have been drinking recently. Taste is fruity up front, and there is a slight metallic note to it. Good, but not habit forming.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

The aroma is mostly sweet fruits, some earthy and maybe even citrus hops tones, and caramel malt too.  A powerfully bitter taste, but also with compliments of fruity sweetness.  Wet, full body in the mouth, with a potent kick of alcohol too, almost overpowering in its force; lighter carbonation, only a moderate fizz.

The taste was very punguent & complex, almost like bitter, sweet, malty, and alcohol all hitting your tastebuds at once.  Definitely an acquired taste.  I winced at the first sip, and until the alcohol numbed my palate it was really quite difficult to drink.  I dont think I even need to mention the walloping 11% ABV.

3042,"2008-04-29",4.5,"Bottle - rating No. 1000 for this beer!  Have been sitting on this sucker for a while now, though its still from the most recent batch.  Lots and lots of clumpy yeast floating around at the bottom of the bottle. Huge, thickly malty aroma, prominent alcohol with raisins and black currants, doughy caramel and subtle yeast, floral tones and a strong, piney burst of PNW hops.  Sugary though, barely dives under the cloying mark.  Pours a gorgeous, luminescent ruby red with a rocky tanned head.  Taste is strongly bitter but not bracing, accompanied by gradual warmth and light sweetness (all of which disappears by the end, in an orgy of bready, saliva-inducing dryness).  Loads of malt, dark and caramel-rich, with subtle wooden tones but not dirty or earthy; no, this is both clean and complex.  Hop presence is strong but not abusive (as in some (I)IPAs), adding a lot of heft and power to an already full body and robust flavor.  Pine needles and dates in with the everpresent floral hop oils.  Yeast backs off considerably but catches an occasional nook in the teeth during the finish.  Malt is thick and seductive and smooth, and theres a sense of complimentary blending here that is often lost in other barleywines - a true Gestalt.  Id have guessed the abv at closer to 8%.  Superb, superb brew - classy, slow-drinking sipper that wants to go much faster!  and not overrated in the least.One of Americas great Barleywines; how lucky we are that it is cheap and easy to come by!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
3042,"2008-04-28",4.2,"Nice brownish ruby color with a thick foamy one-finger head that dissipates fairly quickly. Carbonation continued to rise to the middle throughout which led to significant head regeneration.  Sugary molasses and malts with a strong representation of sweet dark fruits. Slight burning in the nostrils from the alcohol.  As with the smell, sugar and malts dominate the taste with a very pleasant fruit taste. The alcohol also makes its presence felt at bit. Aftertaste of caramel and sticky toffee.  Significant carbonation and alchol left the tongue tingling after each sip. Definitely a sticky, syrupy sweetness throughout.  Despite the alcohol content and its presence in the taste, this is a very drinkable barleywine. Definitely a sipper, though.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
3042,"2008-04-23",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2008 12 oz. bottle.  A dark ruby pour with a little bit of slightly off-white head.  The aroma is a citrusy hops, lots of grapefruit with a lot of sweet malt character.  A sweet malty flavor, balanced well with a slight citric hops finish.  The alcohol is a little too much, and not quite well-balanced enough, but all in all a good beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Tweety"

3042,"2008-04-18",3.6,"Bottle thanks to 17thfloor. Pours a deep translucent amber with thin tan head. Head fades quickly to nothing. Citrus, dark fruit, and plastic dominate the nose. Flavors are dark fruit, mild citrus, wood, slight vanilla. Finishes sweet and bitter at the same time. Leaves behind sticky resinous feeling, bitter and plasticy. Body is mildly syrupy with minor carbonation. This seems out of balance to me and somewhat overdone. Im not really seeing the reason for such high ratings on this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Davinci"

An excellent brew.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"

I have never experienced a barleywine like this, and it almost reminded me more of beers I have had in the ""American Strong Ale"" category.  At any rate, this is an exceptional effort for a style I dont often enjoy.  The body is rich and concentrated with some very surprising bitter fruit, with toffee and almond flavors following with the strong malt backbone.  Good carbonation lifts this brew above the sludge barleywines can become.  An exceptional beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","dmtroyer"

Sweet, woody and malt on the nose with licorice, alcohol and molasses also. Can taste the hops on the finish, but nothing in the aroma. Creamy and full bodied. After it has been out for about two and a half hours the alcohol is much more prominent. It goes from caramel to alcohol to a bitter finish then the warming sticks around longer than the hop bite. This is a great barley wine that should not be taken lightly.","Crofton, Maryland, USA","hoplover406"

I prefer to focus on the 03 because I found it the most enjoyable, and found that the differences between all three were not profound enough to warrant separate ratings. A nice sweet brew with serious hop character despite its age. Alcohol was there, but I wouldnt call it hot. Some cherry notes in the flavor, and some definite nuttyness as well. A sipper for sure.

Flavor has sweetened as the beer has mellowed with age.  Hints of vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, overly ripe plums and wood.  Body is well balanced with just enough hop bitterness to balance out the sugars from the malt.  Some yeasty character present as there is a bit of sediment that has built up over the last three years. Finish is relatively dry with a warming alcohol presence.  Perhaps Victorys best offering.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

3042,"2008-03-12",3.7,"Clear vermilion in hue and topped of a fluffy yellowish beige head, Old Horizontal is bright and enticing in the light. Fruity and sweet the nose balances hoppy grapefruit and banana esters. A slew of sugary sensations aromatically appear: cotton candy, bubble gum and  honey give rise to a medley of blueberries, mandarin, apricot, pear, vanilla and tulips. On the palate a smooth syrupy texture suggests caramel and honey. The springy bitterness of pine resin and citrus reveal the hop profile, while blackberries and strawberries make up the resurgent fruit flavors. A burnt woodiness takes prominence with warming, particularly combined with walnuts and cloves. The smooth mouthfeel adeptly hides a substantial amount of alcohol, betrayed only by the warmth I felt in my stomach. Well made, but somehow comes across as emotionally sterile  not quite my style.

3042,"2008-02-04",3.9,"12 oz bottle courtesy of radiomgb.  (Purchased 06/30/06).  Cloudy amber-orange with a lot of sediment.  Orange-brown head fades quickly to a ring.    The aroma contains American hops, alcohol, and malt, in that order.  (In that odour?)  Nice.  There are a tonne of hops in the flavour, as well, but there is a strong enough malt backbone to keep the hops from being overwhelming.  The combination brings out some nice sweet citrus, caramel, and just a bit of pine and licorice.  Thick, creamy, full body.  Aptly named.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"

3042,"2008-02-03",4.2,"Very sweet aroma. Very fruity. I am very impressed by this actually. I can smell the yeast slightly. I also cannot help to mention I smell figs like crazy. i bought the beer about a month ago. I also let it sit out a while before I tried it, that way I could taste everything. The beer has a nice bubbly head. The beer looks like fig juice, if there was such a thing. Very caramel almost a hint of purple in this thing. I cannot say the color impresses me too much, but still a nice looking beer. When you hold it up to the light you get that nice caramel brown color to really show through. Wow, that beer is very malty and smooth. It has an awesome palate. I can say that this beer deserves the 5/5 palate rating. It is almost silky. Leaves a nice smooth feeling on your tongue. The flavor is a bit interesting. The ABV in this beer is high, but I feel that for how smooth the palata is considering the matls, the alcohol should not show up that much. Very pronounced fruit flavors. The fruit taste just sits on your tongue, and the bitterness is balanced damn near perfectly with the malts. I can taste the figs more than anything. I also can taste the caramel malts, but I am happier to taste the fruits than the malts. I am just concentrated on how well they hid the bitterness. I love IPAs, check my profile, but some barley wines are targeted towards making the beer annoyingly bitter. This has the malt balance it needs. Very delicious beer, and worth drinking again.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

3042,"2008-02-02",4.2,"vertical six with a 04,05, and 06. Always one of my favorite barley wines... will see how the vertical stack goes.

Started with the Dec 14 2004. pour was a bit scary at the bottom, bottom 1/3 seemed chunky... in the glass it was a ruddy dark amber with cloudy sediment on the bottom. a small head that dissipates. aroma is dominated by a caramel malt that has a bit of sweet. mouthful has a pleasant caramel sweet up front, then quickly fades to a bitter mouthful that lingers... not a great aged specimen for sure. 

Bottled Dec 22 2005, This one pours with out the scary lumpiness at the end. Still significant sediment. color and head is the same as the 04. aroma is similar to the 04 but with a bit of hop mixed in. mouthful is smooth with caramel, fig, raisons and a little hoppy finish with a alcohol warming. much better than the 04!

2006 is enjoy before Dec 12 2011. same color same small head with little sediment and no chunky pour. the hops have moved up front in the aroma but the caramel and malt is still there. mouthful is crisp with with a balance malt and hop palate. This has a barley wine back bone with a bit to zesty citrus hop to it. very nice...

i think the younger this gets the better it is.  it has always been a favorite barley wine, and that is perhaps why it never lasts in the cellar, and turns out to be a good thing. The hop character moves to the background as it ages, and a hoppy barley wine is what makes the Old H special.

The aroma is a magnifisent display of malt sweetness, candy sugar, and fruity hops with seemingly low bitterness. Well so much for seemingly low bitterness, cuz these hops definitely pack a punch in the flavour. This barley wine has an especially vinous character and is extremely quaffable given the alcohol presence and actual content. Plum, brown sugar, red grapes, toffee and honeydew make up the malty-sweet backbone with citric hops and malted barley coming through up front. The finish is port-like, but a little thin and muted, making the fnish surprisingly clean and dry. The abv is well hidden on the palate, but you cant hide booze from the throat and chest.

Sweet mellow fruit on the nose, maybe melon, fig, overripe plum. Molasses. 

New England maple syrup, toffee, sticky hops, maybe even pecan as far as flavor notes. You cant taste the alcohol but you can feel it in your chest, an excellent winter beer.

Nice earthy and sweet toffee malts with a tingly pine hop bitterness in the end.  Notes of dark fruit provide a pleasing dimension underneath.

3042,"2007-12-24",4.1,"Bottle. Malts have a moderate aroma of caramel and light bread, hops have a light note of perfume and grapefruit peel, yeast has a moderate smell of dough, and pepper and solvent were also noted. Head is creamy, a little off white, it has almost no lacing but the body of the beer coated the glass fairly well, and the head was mostly lasting. Color is a clear mahogany. It starts heavily sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes moderately sweet and bitter and lightly acidic. Body is medium to full, creamy textured, and has a lively carbonation. It finishes lightly dry without astringency. The aroma threw me off a little, but the great flavor more than made up for it.

3042,"2007-11-11",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2009 Vintage 2000, cellared until 2004 at Monks Cafe, Philadelphia. 

Hazy amber color, good change in hue whether viewing from top or bottom portion of the tulip shaped glass. Silky white/grayish head retains well. 

Big aroma of malt and hops. Hops are tamed on the palate but still about the same on the nose. Standard victory character is apparent. 

On the palate there is an unexpected softness and gentleness to the beer. Amazing. The malt is just huge. Hops are there but only to help balance some. You dont get a huge hop flavor. But its so soft and smooth on the palate. Weird. 

Theres a new toasted cracker with marshmallow like sweetness in this beer that I never see in the young, non-aged versions. Marshmallow might seem odd but the word does fit the taste quite well. Body seems fuller than usual, but maybe its just because the ale I had before this was light bodied. 

Aftertaste lingers and lingers. Malt is the focus yet again.

Appearance: Pours a clearish, orangey-brown body with a medium, off-white head.

Smell: Heavy caramel malt aroma with notes of brown sugar, honey, and a spiced tangerine fruitiness.

Taste: Succulent sweet taste of caramel and honey. Hint of brown sugar. Bright tangerine marmalade flavor jumps in. Any hop bitterness has long since faded (now Im being told it may be a bit older).  Boozey, surprisingly fruity finish.

3042,"2007-10-16",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2012 12 oz bottled Dec 14 04.  My first craft beer case buy, a direct result of Ratebeer.  I wanted to repay a friend for some fall yard work.  Hoping to find the best beer i did some googling and found RB.  Ended up putting together a case of Old Ho, Storm King, SN Celebration and St.B12.  It was too early for new Ho but managed to find a case of 04.  Cellared for 2 years.  Clear honey brown with a ring and a wisp.  Buttery caramel and orange marmalade.  A touch of campfire smoke.  This has softened quite a bit from earlier samples but still remains vibrant.  Tastes much like the aroma promises.  Caramel and whipped orange nougat melt away into a grassy bitterness that serves as a perfect foil.  A simple barleywine executed to perfection.  6/16/12 - Gapped vertical with the last of my 04s, a Best By 2011 (brewed in 06?) and a Best By 2015 (brewed in 2010).  Aromawise the 06 is sweetest and yeasty, the 10 still showing some hops to balance the caramel, and the 04 not so sweet and a bit musty.  Taste of the 10 has some hoppy bitterness but mostly caramel and quite tasty.  The sweetness of the 06 is more complex, diminished hops, notes of clove.  The 04 is fading with watery caramel, a touch of cardamon and cardboard.  For my taste cellaring 3 to 5 years seems perfect.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

Produces a thin, wispy off-white head. Deeply rich aromas of dark dried fruits (fig, raisin, prune) along with some dark rum, molasses, spice, dark caramel and orange peel with just the faintest hint of hops. Palate is medium bodied, but has a smooth sryupy texture with minimal carbonation. Flavor is predominantly fruity sweet but short of cloying. Reminiscent of rum or brandy soaked fruit cake topped with toffee candies, buckwheat honey, vanilla and a sprinkle of dried orange peel and hops. 11% alcohol amps up the flavors nicely, but not hot or obtrusive in anyway. For a big English style BW this one goes down fairly easy and smoothly. Simply said, just a classic.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

3042,"2007-08-04",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2007 This brew pours amber w/ raspberry tones. The froth produced is minimal and the lacing is almost non existant. Aroma is weak beholding meaty malts and aged hops. Full nectar w/ creamy residual effers. But ofcoarse, its a barley wine, its supposed to be sweet.  Theres a killer hop component that digs in early and sticks like a Detroit white out on 75 North bound near Pine Knob. This would stop most people cold in their tracks but I am  a warrior of Viking descent. We sacked Rome and Ill sack this brew.  A full Nelson and two knuckle sandwiches later this brew goes down screaming.  The bittering component is on the peachpit side and it cuts deep.

3042,"2007-07-20",4.2,"This beer looks great. It is a deep brown, with a beige head forming over it. The head grows too large if you dont pour it just right. It actually looks so nice that when I poured mine in a glass one of my friends demanded that I bring him a glass because it looked that good. The aroma is intense and fruity (citrusy). The taste slams you in the mouth. Not only is the beer thick as all hell, but the multifarious array of flavours knocks you back. It is sweet, bitter, fruity, hoppy all at the same time. The alcohol gives it a warming quality and the alcohol is nearly undetectable if it were not for the aforementioned quality. Now, typically I dont mention this in beer reviews, but this beer is great to get drunk off of. After having two you feel like you just spent two hours at the bar. The drunk it produces is a heavy, lazy drunk, slipping you into a mild euphoria that only a beer of this quality could. It is more of a wine drunk than a beer drunk and one case of these babies will make a good 5-6 people happy.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

Big chunks of stuff were revealed only at the end of the glass.  It carries a soft aroma of caramel apples, sweet malt, and possibly figs.  It is smooth and slick; full bodied with prickly carbonation.  There is a good balance of bitter and sweet going on here.  The flavor is very focused, so its hard to pick anything out.  Fruit blends with caramel and a wooden bitterness, that fades a little quicker than expected, to reveal the peppery alcohol.  Theres an ester in here that conjures up ""mixed fruit in heavy syrup"".  The sweetness, bitterness and gravity are well under control and they dont fight for attention.

3042,"2007-06-04",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2007 Rated 3/16/07:  Ive been hunting for this one for quite some time and wouldnt you know I was able to find it as I recently discovered a local store closer to my house than any of the other decent beer stores. Getting a sixer of this was a no brainer and after enjoying one here and there I can say that this is a beautiful barleywine. Aroma is an outstanding bouquet of mixed flowers, berries, and dark fruits. Nice to the nostrils, the aroma is fantastic and mellow. Amber pour with some copper color swirled in, a nice finger thick head quickly forms and then gives way to a filmy tan layer. Appearance is thick and hazy through the glass with a sporadic lazy carbonation. Mouthfeel is very thick, borderline chewy this brew takes time to drink so dont be in a rush once you crack one open. Finish is rich and creamy with a quick burst of alcohol that is gone before swallowed. Heavy malts are blended with a helping dose of hops. Lots of flavor in this one like caramel, figs, black licorice, pine, anise, raisins, and...well much more than I am likely to detect. That flowery bouquet ties the aroma and flavor together and really leaves a lasting impression. Not exactly sure of the vintage but the bottle states best before 2011.

Enjoy before 12/29/11

Old Horizontal poured a hazy burnt caramel(if that makes sense). A half finger head formed on the pour that quickly dropped to nothing but a small swirling island of white foam. When held to the light it glows ruby red. I see only a couple carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. This head eventually disappears completely. There is zero sign of any head after 1/4 of the glass is drank. The lack of head detracts from the overall impression.

Smell is a little underwhelming but what is there is juicy. A big aroma of grape bubblegum greets my nose upfront. This is mixed with some floral characteristics such as rose petals. Theres also somewhat of a tea like quality present. Graininess shows as this barleywine heads to room temp. Mild alcohol. Like I said, it smells juicy but there isnt substance.

Flavor starts off with a strong graininess. The grape juice comes around mid palate but is much more subdued than in the aroma. A moderate hop bite shows up and finishes things off with a decent citric bitterness. Warming alcohol on the swallow. This is on the fence here between a 3.5 and 4. Ill give it the benefit of the doubt.

Body is on the heavier side of medium with sluggish carbonation. Leaves a mild coating on the throat that goes nicely for the style. Slightly warming alcohol on the swallow. Nice.

Drinkability is actually pretty good for the high ABV. I could drink a couple in a sitting.

Not the best example of an American Barleywine Ive had but it is an enjoyable brew. Fairly simple flavors but enjoyable none the less.

Surprisingly balanced flavor between sweetness and bitterness but with alcohol making a presence; candy-like raisins and light berries with hazelnut, light resinous hops, and a drying bready note.

Subtle leafy hops create a light tartness.  Not very complex.  Overall good but not excellent.

Sweet caramel and toffee flavors start off first on the palate, followed closely by some golden toasted marshmellow.  A touch of fresh peaches and cream add some silky light fruity characters just before the hops begin to take over full time.  Some bitter high alpha hops round out the finish with a bold, yet balanced finish, leaving tastes of pithy white grapefruit and a mild alchol heat lingering warmly on the palate.

S: A very interesting scent, the beer almost smells refreshing, like a breakfast cocktail. Its definitely sweet and makes me want to take a gigantic gulp, but knowing what lies ahead, I dont plan on doing that.

T: Woah. I was unprepared for the first sip and the almost overwhelming alcohol presence, sort of like a Jack & Coke thats got flat/watered-down, or a zinfandel that someone stuck in the fridge. It has a very large boozy raspberry or cherry flavoring to it that Im not sure about, perhaps as it warms...and yes, that is the case. The beer gets better as it warms (as would be expected). Lots of complex flavors to this one, though very little, if any, finish.

M: The thinnest barleywine Ive had, its gone from your mouth as quickly as you sip it. I actually prefer my barleys to be a big ""bigger"" in terms of mouthfeel, but this one actually helps the drinkability.

D: Once youre past that initial burst of booziness, this beer becomes fairly easy to drink. Still not a chugging beer, heh, but not very hard to drink given the very high ABV. Id do more than one of these in a sitting.

I think many rate craft beers with a high alky content high right off the bat.  Very strong, almost unbearable.  Not easily enjoyed if drank like a beer.

Palate is very viscous and very mellow in spite of copious hops. Finishes with a sweet hop tang and a lingering burn from the alcohol and hop oils. Very good.

Wow! Now that I have a half hearted appreciation for this style I realize that this is AWESOME! Not over the top like a lot of American barley wine. The big thing here (small as it may seem for you Europeans) is the carbonation. Great carbonation, tastes fresh and does not feel like you are drinking old motor oil. Nice sweet malty aroma with a warming alcohol burn but not getting too Vicks Vapo-Rubby with it. The most drinkable barley wine to date for me.

Not a bad barley wine from one of my ol faithfuls, Victory. This was a nice take on the genre with a bitterness to it that I havent noticed in barley wines before. I dont drink these often but I would have this one again. Pour was a rich amber with a perfect 1 finger head. The aroma was fruity and the taste was caramelly with malt and alcohol aftertaste.

I know fellow raters enjoy hops, but I dont enjoy them as much as most people.  The ending of this beer (last swallow down your throat) is very hoppy.

12oz bottle dated 12/04 (aged for 3 years). nose of raisins, toffee, and dark fruits. flavors of sweet toffee, tobacco, and some dark fruits. some hop bitterness too. pretty dry and alcohol warmth finishes. a rather short and watery palate. i think i like this a little more than at 2 years but it really isnt very complex. not sure if more age will help.6/4/7/3/14=3.4

3042,"2006-10-07",4.2,"12-oz.; thanks, BeachBum25! This is a pretty confusing beer. And thats actually whats such a pleasure about it. Starts off very barleywine-like, with a thick-looking, fairly still-looking, ruddy amber pour with ruby highlights and a tan head. The head falls to a psychedelic paisley swirl before you can put the bottle down. Big fruit on the nose, figgy and plummy and sharply boozy. Caramel and toffee are there, too-when its cooler, the caramel is actually borderline domineering: the malt is strong with this one. The attack has the obligatory tawniness, caramel and butterscotch, roast and nuts. The finish is a mystery. What is that? Orange pith? Coriander? Rauch malt? Burning leaves? Its almost a hollow flavor, too. Theres crisp, resiny hops there, but theyre in the minority, and its proving difficult to name the mystery ingredient in the finish. The bodys light for a barleywine, the sugars are quite--and quite admirably-subdued, and the carb is low. Theres none of the usual lapel-grabbing trouble you get from a young barleywine here.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Smelt of  moderate malty sweetness with light sweet spicy banana bread and light alcohol and some resin.

3042,"2006-08-15",3.9,"Pours a thick brick brown into the glass, with a lacing off-white head.  Looks initially syrupy.  The nose is comforting, of raisins, plums, prunes, dark fruit, brown sugar and molasses.  Very syrupy mouthfeel, thick and coating.  There is an initial sweet toffee malt upfront, with huge notes of brown sugar, molasses and raisins.  Then, alcohol and hops take over in the mid-palate, and round out with a slightly alcoholic pepper finish.  This is a unique take on the barleywine style, as Ive had quite a few, and this is the hoppiest Ive noted.  Its not a bad contingency, but makes the mouthfeel suffer slightly.  The contrast, which should cut (via the hops) the palate, instead clashes slightly with the syrupy-oily notes.  Im getting two distinctly different directions at the same time.  Again, this isnt a bad brew, but Im keeping it from cresting the 4-point scale due to inconsistencies in the mouthfeel, caused by diverse flavor palates which affect my overall impression.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

3042,"2006-08-02",4.5,"I previously wrote a review from the bottle. This is a similar review but the taste on tap is not as green IMO from the tap. So I made a few edits and my ratings are different. 

I had Old Horizontal on tap at Victory last year and I loved it. One of my all time favorite beers. I was looking forward to when I could get it for this (the 05) year. I was a bit disappointed because the previous batch seemed to be a bit more mellow (and I preferred that) but we will see what is yet to come.


Appearance: This beer pours a beautiful translucent amber color with great lacing.

Smell: Crisp and hoppy with undertones of sweet malts. Hints of alcohol peek through.

Taste: MUCH hoppier than I remember. A bit too green in taste (like rabbit food green). The green hops just got right up in my face. Smooth-ish but (did I say) green, layered on top of a very nice sweet malt base. I like the alcohol that shows through. (as a whiskey/wine fan I like alcohol just not the green tongue aftertaste). 

Mouthfeel: Crisp and light for a barley wine. Not very sticky more dry and noticeable alcohol pucker.

Drinkability: What I had last year on-tap was fantastic but this I have to say was bearable but not terribly great! A bit too hoppy for me, but not a bad choice to accompany a meal or to have with cheese on the side.

I had this again on-tap. I definitely prefer it at Victory on-tap. I did prefer 04s batch to 05s and I hope that 06s will mellow a bit again.

Hope this is helpful.

3042,"2006-07-31",4.2,"Bottle.  Bottled Dec 29 2004.  Its Victory allright as I pour the bottle into the glass I can already smell the hops!  Even in a barleywine, they stuff it full of that magical green cone... forget the beanstalk, Jack wouldnt have even climbed if it were a hop vine... he would have cut it down as soon as he smelled it,  so he could wet hop a brew.... back to the rating... not much head on a hazy amber color... great nose of sweet toffee, pineapple, some pinecone maybe, nice!  flavor is great, sweet chewy malt with a cookie flavor sneaking in before a bit of hop bitterness and then the inevitable alchohol burn.... I actually like this beer a little cooler than most barleywines, because the flavors seem to be overpowered a bit by the burn as it warms.  Great mouthfeel as this one is silky and smooth... still some good chunks rolling around in the bottom of the glass as I continue to quaff this beauty.... another great one from the dirty side of Pennsylvania... great job Victory!","Sligo","pjk33"
3042,"2006-07-31",4.1,"Bottle best by Jan 24 11. You got to be kidding me. How can someone even keep a beer arround for five years without trying it. Its got a stong alcohol aroma along with barley grain and pine.
Barley wheat flavor and some alcohol punch. Definently a body warmer. Good thing it wont break 100 today need some water for hydraysion.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Bockyhorsey"
3042,"2006-07-29",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 29, 2008 Nice pour, sweet, hoppy aroma.  Flavor alternates between nice sweetness and fairly bold, piney/sweet hops.  Very nice, even finish that stays around but not in an annoying way.  I see a common theme with these victory beers - great, almost IPA-ish hop flavor in other strong ales.  Much like storm kings great hoppy flavor, this one satisfies and leaves you longing for more.  Alcohol barely noticable at 10%+.  Wonderful.  ****** March 2007 head to head of 05 and 06 vintages.  2005 has mellowed well, but still boasts a substantial hop flavor that mixes well with the malty sweetness.  2006 looks darker and has almost Doppelbock-like qualities in malt flavor and aroma.  Newer vintage is obviously stronger and more alcoholey, but still complex and rich.  


2/29/08 - its re-rate day!  Somehow I lost my rating of the 2000 bottle of this - I remember it being a tad thin and oxidized but still damn good.  I decided to try an 05, 06, and 07 back to back tonight - I still find the 05 to be rather sweet and grainy, but with some very good honey sweetness.  06 is my least favorite - not all that great right now.  07 is pleasantly suprising, probably the best of the bunch with some time under its belt - nice hop usage with a light fruit tartness.  I took this down a few points, but its still an old standby and one of my favorites - not as good to me as it was as a newbie rater, but still my favorite Victory beer.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
3042,"2006-07-27",3.8,"As I love barleywines, Ive been trying to track this one down for a while.  Found it in Marcy, NY.  Quite nice, one of my favorite barleywines.  Not much of a head, but it did have good lacing.  Aroma was of sweet malt and fruity.  Taste was quite sweet and thick mouthfeel.  I was a little unimpressed.  Maybe my expectations were set a bit too high.  Good, but not great.","Georgia, USA","doubleipa"

Ill definitely be saving the rest of these to see how well it ages. 9/4/9/4/18

Re-rate 12/08/06: Same vintage.  Though its only been about 5 months, this has held up quite well.  Interestingly, I was greeted with a hoppy aroma before the familiar caramel and dark fruits.

Aroma is lotsa brown sugar, molasses, burnt caramel--not to the point of bad, but toasted caramel?--and raisins.  I do get some nuts and a hint of vanilla as well.  As far as hops go, I get some pine and earthiness.  The taste is very cereal and grainy.  To save typing, the taste is much the same, the cereal is fairly dominant in the finish.  Alcohol is noticeable, though doesnt seem quite like 10.5% (my bottle says 11%).  Nuts and burnt caramel are the strongest up front, vanilla still there as well.  Soft carbonation, full bodied.

Flavor was very malty with a little bitterness on the back of the tongue and slight alcohol burn, but the alcohol wa actually hidden very well. Also got a little dark fruit flavor in the after taste.  This was very good but I was expecting to like this a little more than i did.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"

3042,"2006-07-07",3.9,"Bottled on 12/9/05.  Pours a good looking amber color with a light head that dissipates with a bit of lace.  Some decent looking carbonation (a bit surprising).  The aroma is sweet caramel and full malt aromas.  A bit nutty with some dried dates and wood.  Fairly light aroma though.  The flavor is different than I expected.  And actually, after having the new hair of the dog, Ive noticed that these Barley Wines that are rated so high are much woodier and dryer than other barley wines.  Perhaps this is a stylistic difference that I am not used to, but thus far I have not come to fully appreciate it.  Anyhow, I got some wood, earthy hops, bourbon hints and burnt caramel initially.  There was some malty/caramel/sweetness deep down that I found myself wanting more of.  There are also hints of dry coco/dark chocolate and dark dry fruit that linger and the finish cuts to a dryish bitterness that is earthy.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

The beer poured clear amber with a thin tan fizzy head. The first whiff is an assult of fresh fruity citrus hops, orange and lemon. After recovering, malty notes are dectecable, mainly caramel, oak, and vanilla, which are also present in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, carrying fruit beneath bitterness of a magnitude I wasnt expecting. This bitterness lasted long into the finish, forgetting the nice malty underbelly. The alcohol was very noticeable by mid-bottle.

The aroma is hop heavy, Im thinking similar to SN Bigfoot.  But the taste is great,  awesome, surprising.  The hops are present and very noticeable. Surprisingly smooth for 11%.  The bitterness of the hops is present at the end of the flavor.  The other barely wine flavors are subdued in the alcoholic taste department but the sweetness is there.  The body is lighter than expected for a beer like this.  The palate is a little lacking, with little texture and no essence of the brew felt.  I am enjoying this with a sweet navel orange.  This is a young brew and I have another bottle of the same batch, which I will re-rate in later. 7/4/9/3/18=4.1 Same batch, same six pack, a bit more than a year later.  Bottle was cellared for about 6 months and closet stored (mostly cooler months) for about 6 months.  There is no head and just a bit of lacing.  Aroma is still full of hops, of course not as fresh, citrus and heavy sweet berry.  Richer and deeper malt flavor seem to come out as well, dark fruits, plums.  But also what seems to be DMS is setting, a buttery thick molasses aspect.  Taste is very light still in comparison to this big beer.  Sweet and bitter hop flavor (think bitter slightly brownish strawberries).  Then comes an astringent hop finish.  After a year seems to be going way downhill.  More ratings to follow. 7/3/7/3/15=3.5Same batch, same 6 pack, cellared for most of the time (about 31 months).  Pours  with a large head that fades to a thick, glass sticking, lacing. Aroma is musty fruit and ""sitting out too long tea"" British maltiness."" Taste is lots of English tea with BW-like fruit accents. Well... I am not more impressed than before. 2.5 years old and its just getting worse. Fortunately, it seems the DMS-like aspects have faded and turned into a weird British-tea like aspect. 7/3/7/3/14.

I feel like victory almost tried too hard to make this a calm, relaxing beer and forgot to balance out the malts.  That being said, it is solid and does a good job of hiding the alcohol.  A good beer when placed in the correct context...occassionally enjoyed and in cold weather.","USA","kylelackner"
3042,"2006-03-13",3.6,"Bottle (bottled on Dec, 04) from my favorite Finnish expatriate jtw - thanks John! To start with aroma, were getting something else than expected: instead of offensive hops dark fruits, rich caramel malts and sugary alcohol dominate the aroma. Im assuming hops have mellowed with age leading to more complex aroma, which isnt bad at all. As the liquid gets warmer, alcohol is getting more evident in the aroma. Flavor continues on the same trails with sugary, fruity sweetness, warming alcohol, wood and hops (not that much though). Beautiful pour is probably the best part of this beer, body in not so huge. Although I have to admit I was expecting more hop-dominated American barley wine (should try it younger I guess) I found the complexity of this beer quite enjoyable and the warming effect comfortable on this cold winter night up here in north. All in all, the best beer so far from the brewery which hasnt quite lived up to my expectations.","Helsinki, FINLAND","bogdi1"

3042,"2006-03-04",3.5,"12oz bottle, 2005 vintage.Major thanks to JHop for this one via trade. Pours a clear dark ruby-red with thinnish white head that quickly dissipates and leaves little lacing. Aroma of PNW hops clashing with intensely sweet caramel malt. Flavor confirms what the aroma hints at -- acrid hop bitterness that often results when piney PNW hops are combined with a darker, sweeter malt base. Thankfully its not as bad as in other PNW-hopped barleywines, as the sugary malt is predominant as it should be with this style. Would have liked more fruity elements in the flavor as well. Nice thick mouthfeel and palate. Pretty good as American barleywines go, pretty average for someone who prefers a more traditional English approach.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"
3042,"2006-03-04",4.2,"Bottle courtesy of HogTownHarry. Bottled Dec.04. Pours a very bubbly murky dark amber-orange with a lasting average size off-white head. Fantastic aroma of sweet malt, caramel, lots of floral hops, pine, brown sugar and alcohol -- lots going on there and its very lovely. Delicious flavour follows the aroma -- it isnt as big as some Barley Wines, not as hoppy or boozy, but in a good way -- its really smooth and goes down really easy. Medium to full bodied. A truly wonderful Barley Wine, one of the best in my opinion, and definitely one of my favourites.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"

3042,"2006-02-23",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2007 Rerate:  I believe I rated this rather early in my rating career.  So I figured Id give it a second look.  Clear pretty red body with a ring of head hovering above.  Aroma is pretty darn complex.  Caramel, spice, hops, plums, raisin.  Taste is heavy on the caramel malts, almost like a tootsie roll.  One drawback may be the fact that there is a slight alcoholic bite, but that can be overlooked.  Still is a top notch barley wine.  The reasons I wanted to revisit this beer are twofold.  One, to see if this holds up against other top of the line barley wines, which it does, IMO.  Two, to see if Victory in general has lost its edge, which is commonly stated in the beer world.  Obviously, I dont think it has.  I may enjoy Old Ruffian or Third Coast Ale more than this, but this beer is still very solid.

Original Rating: Bottle.  Imagine a long cold winter night, perched in front of the fireplace.  Snow gently falling outside while a cold winter breeze gives the air a chill.  Now imagine a complex fruity, caramelly, severely hopped beer being sipped in full enjoyment.  There you have Victory Old Horizontal!  So well crafted, it just sits there and warms your body.  The only glaring negative on the beer is that the higher alcohol is not all that well hidden.  I dont mind; just couldnt put down a lot of these, but then again, thats not necessarily the point.  Its more for enjoying each and every sip!  Aroma 9 - Appearance 5 - Flavor 10 - Palate 4 - Overall 18 - Total 4.6","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

The flavors are a balance of rich caramel malt and fruity, floral hops.  The malt carries a small amount of fig and prune along with it.  Assertive, but not aggressive bitterness in the end to clean it all out and get you ready to start over again.  Nice clean, smooth palate.  rich and complete mouthfeel, but not heavy or full.

Poured the same body, maybe a few more floaties. Nose was just divine though. The grapefruity aroma was still there, but almost brought out a vanillalike (perhaps an evolution of the citrus?) nose. I wanted to fall in the glass. The smooth caramel malts were there too. The flavor was the same, and at 11% was DANGEROUSLY drinkable. Best balance Ive seen for a BW. The hops were there, and very tasty, but not overbearing. Same deal with the malts. Huge flavor profile yet very drinkable.

This is one of the most impressive barleywines on the market today, and it will continue to improve with age.

Mouthfeel is juicy, astringent, quite full-bodied for the style.  A solid barley wine, maybe could age for even greater smoothness, but right up there .. as tupalev notes, perhaps it could be a little more complex, but nevertheless I liked it a lot.  So did my wife.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

At almost a year old this has really balanced out and blended nicely, yet the hops have stuck around.  Pours a slightly hazy orange/mahogany/copper with a nicely sustaining/lacing head.  Aroma of dark fruits, caramel, malts, vanilla, cherry and some light hops (grapefruit/pine).  Flavor was along the same lines, just slightly stepped up with more of the hops coming through in the taste.  The alcohol is well hidden.  An overall sweetness to both the aroma and flavor.

Firey oranges, reds and browns.  Inviting.  Warming, but not the least bit harsh.  Maple, pine, the typical caramel and toffee that we all love oh so much.  Silky smooth all the way down.

The aroma reminded me of Full Sail Boardhead, only because I had that first.  There is  apple, brown sugar, maple syrup, malt, and flowers in the complex aroma. Several flavors and all are good. The first is very sweet fruit, followed by sweet malt.  Next is bitter hops and salt.  Aftertaste is of light bitter hops combined with lingering sweet fruit as if it were a high quality IPA.

I get alot of iced tea flavor in the long bitter finish.  Thick and chewy mouthfeel with a mouth coating goodness.  Very soft carbonation.  This is a really good American Style Barleywine.

3042,"2005-11-15",4.8,"Bottled Feb. 4, 2005.  Pour was an eerie, cloudy shade of orangish-amber with a tall and creamy beige head.  Looked quite nice as the head was about as tall as the liquid.. and it filled my large snifter to capacity.  Extra-fine sediment suspended in there, and intricate lacing followed the liquid down.  Nose picked up adult Christmas candy (move over eggnog)... deep and seductive caramel and molasses sweetness, holiday spices, citrus and darker fruits, and a wonderful floral hop presence... and albeit not explicit, you know theres a solid dose of alcohol lurking beneath your nose.  Somehow, the magnificent interplay of flavors outshined the aroma.  I dont know how it happened, but damn was this good!  Sugarplums, oranges, and grapefruit in there tasted like they were personally squeezed/stomped by a magical beer elf just for me.  Caramel and molasses provided a fantastic medium backbone, with just the right amount of sweetness.  Noble hoppage gave the brew a perfect floral/earthy quality, and was present from first whiff through four minutes after the finish.  Alcohol was there, but only to give the flavor some extra zest, to impart some throat- and belly-warming-ness, and to make me feel quite fine when I had laid this most excellent brew to rest.

Pours a hazy dark copper with a frothy two finger head that settles very slowly to a thick cap that never really fades, leaving behind a dense webbing of lace.

Smell; a little bit sweet with brown sugar, caramel and toffee. Theres some dark cherries, a touch of candied apples, with a sprinkling of cocoa.

Taste; initially fruity, with cherries and apples, and then is followed by the caramel, brown sugar and cocoa. Theres definitely some hop bitterness, and a little bit of alcohol flavor present. With this being about a year and a half old the hops are a bit more toned down, and the alcohol is not quite as strong in the flavor profile as the fresh ones Ive had before. I think this makes for a much smoother and blended flavor. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, with a good drinkability that would be higher if the abv were not so high.

I dont usually re-review beers, but I previously had a much younger version of this, and I felt with the age of this beer, and its effects it had on its flavor and appearance, it was warranted.

In the color and somewhat in the nose, this is a barleywine. On the palate, the hops hit you like a IIPA. Theres some of the stereotypical caramel and toffee notes, but absent is the malt backbone to offset the hops. Im not bothered by the alcohol, but the hops I found excessive.

Coats the inside of the mouth and is oh so smooth and balanced.  There is absolutely no sign of the 11% alcohol in this one.  It is easy to see why Old Ho stays in the top 50.  Great Barleywine!","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"

Hops are also very apparent in the nose: spicy and earthy.  A moderate ester profile is also present.  Flavor is also big and malty.  Sweet with crystal malt and breadiness.  Hops are spicy and citrussy in flavor with plenty enough bitterness to back up the syrupy sweetness and hop flavor.

Citrus hops in the finish, but not as much as I anticipated considering it only a few months old.  Alcohol covered up very well, a touch of burn is really only noticeable if youre looking for it.  More malt and more fruit compared to some hopped up American barley wines (not that I have a problem with hopped up barley wines). Very nice.  
Same batch as above.  The aroma is a combination of caramel, chocolate, real light fruitiness, and light oxidized.  There is also a moderate alcohol that I didnt get previously.   In the flavor, the caramel has intensified with some light chocolate and banana bread.  Slight oxidation and extremely mild citrus hops in the finish.  There is no burn at all as I noted before.

3042,"2005-02-20",4.6,"Wonderful aroma from the moment the bottle is opened. Smelled of nuts with hints of fruit, almost a tangy/spice smell.  Taste was quite a pleasant surprise as it was not as sweet as I anticipated.  The feel was balanced with a decisive punch of alcohol on the way down.  An excellent beer that can be enjoyed more casually than many other specialty beers.","Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, USA","maximusud"
3042,"2005-02-18",4.0,"Brownish red in colour, with a large fluffy head. My first b/w and wasnt expecting to enjoy, I was wrong. Taste is hops, wine, and a mild caramel sweetness.

3042,"2005-02-15",4.4,"Bottled. This was really unlike any other barley wine Ive had. It poured a rich, burnt sugar amber, and even pouring it at an arms length, I could still smell the hops and sweetness. The sweet nose is deceiving, though. I was really surprised by the strong bitterness brought on by the hops, which is a characteristic unlike any b/w Ive had. It lacks the treacly character that often dominates and blights the style. Indeed, the biggest element I took away from tasting this was the hops. Excellent.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","MillStreetMan"
3042,"2005-02-13",3.8,"Red/amber, murky beer, with a white frothy head. Aroma is hoppy and flowery, with honey sweetness and a touch of pepper.

There is a pleasant oily hop aroma along with wood wax and pine resin. Its a very inviting and compelling aroma. Tipping the beer into the mouth is very pleasurable - its thick as slow glue.

Syrupy dark fruit consisting of raisin, plumb, and black cherry swirled together and fermented with a nice touch of sweet malt.  The bittering hops keeps it from being to cloying.

Hops are the beginning and the end of the taste, with alcohol coming through a little on the tail.  The middle of the taste is a superb blend of fruits and spices.  Thought I got hints of cinnamon and oranges.  The more of them I try, I have to think barley wines are really an acquired taste.  Im not crazy about this but as far as quality brews go, it is obviously at the top end.

There is also that recognizable sweetness that Victory has in the beers.  The aroma and the taste are both very spicy.  The sweetness in the taste is great.  This is Victorys best so far I think.

This most closely resembles Bells Batch 6000 for its buttery caramel character.  The sweetness is exactly as it should be, with the mouthfeel of honey on the tongue.

Strong aroma containing a good amount of both hops and malty sweetness with slight hints of yeast and alcohol. The malt is what dominates the flavor with a nice sweetness.

3042,"2004-11-07",3.8,"This beer pours a dark copper color with a thin white foamy head which dissipated from the getgo. The aroma is strong and alcohol with sweet malt, vinous grapes, a hint of brandy, a dash of wood and twigs, some licorice and candy sugar as well with perhaps the slightest hint of cherry. This beer packs a WALLOP of a punch, but you dont realize it until the beer has fully warmed up...oh yeah.. hint FIN HINT...let this beer warm to 55-60F...you talk about a DRASTIC difference in taste from 50F to this.... The flavor is definitely alcoholic and vinous, perhaps a little too much for my tastes to be completely honest. Heavy sour grapes, wood, and a slight hint of pineyness and hoppiness in the finish. Very warming and medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness that is typical to a barleywine. Very viscous and syrupy finish, slightly cloying, but as I said, somewhat hoppy and bitter in mid-finish. A very good barleywine, but perhaps hyped up a tad bit more than I expected.

3042,"2004-10-22",4.1,"Received via a trade, from beeradvocate Ninjaworm, this was a Nov 18, 2003 bottling.  Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a goblet, the body was hazy copper, with a tan head that was short lived.  The lacing was very good.  The aroma was very strong maple syrup and raisins and could be sensed from the bottle before pouring in the glass.  There was also a strong pine straw like hop presence and perfumey alcohol.  The taste was vinous, raisin laden, spicy, bitter, and contained strong oxidative notes.   While complex and interesting, the intensity was a few notches short of the super hopped up West Coast style Barleywines.  The alcohol was more of a slow burn, than an intense one.  The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than anticipated.  A soothing beer to calm your jitters before bedtime, for sure.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

First flavors to come out are caramel, a little prune, hops, grapefruit, some light spices I cannot put my finger on (anise? black pepper?), grape, and a little orange. One thing I cant detect is alcohol, even tho it is 11% ABV. The flavors are VERY subdued for a barleywine. I know the term balanced is thrown around alot, but I gotta say it. This sutff is balanced perfectly. No flavor out ranks any other flavor, they all mingle together in your mouth and make slow sweet love.

As expected, its sweet but certainly not in a sucrose way. There are also highly present hops in there, fighting a fun losing battle which the malts naturally win at this high percentage (that's why the alcohol is so hard to detect). One thing: speaking from experience as one who has literally drunk bottles of beer from the 1800s, Id really think the body of this would be bettered by trying a version without carbonation - this style is really approaching one of my experiences with the authentic classics. The bubbles dont make it ""bad"" but still arent an original part of this style. In any case, there is an amazing finish - I could almost have had a few sips of Dows Ruby Port!

The aroma is brilliant. Not as big as I expected, but really thick with malt sweetness. Also hops that freshen up the aroma and bring it to a higher level.

First sip reveals a flavour-bomb. This is mind blowing. Entry is thick and malty, not as fruity as the aroma (though banana can be found on both fronts). Then, the hops slowly reveal their presence. Not hoppy as I had imagined from reading the descriptions, no, the bitterness is masked by the huge malt. They still give the beer amazing freshness, considering how heavy and full it is. Some citrus as the hops start to take over, sliding towards piney freshness as it ends in a remarkably sweet, yet fresh and assertive aftertaste that lasts practically forever.

I can't bring myself to give it full marks on Overall Impression, I still think a beer will come along that will be even better, but this is one of the best I've had.","Falun, SWEDEN","Kalli"

3042,"2004-04-07",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2004 Very rich and full flavor. The alcohol is well hidden considering that it is 11%. I don't have much experience with barley wines, but this is the best I have ever had without a doubt.

3042,"2004-04-05",3.9,"Bottled.  Foggy deep amber colour with a thick, smooth and soft beige head. Sweet apricot and hop aroma, dense and generous. The bouquet really develops as the beer warms from its cellar temperature.  The alcohol is forward on the palate and hits you in the back of the throat initially but then the rich sweet flavours take over. Silky/oily texture with lingering hops on the palate. Phenomenally dense flavour and fairly well proportioned as well, giving it the front running in its category.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"
3042,"2004-04-02",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2005 02 vintage.  Murky orangish brown color.  Barely any head retention.  Very light nose, mostly consisting of alcohol and a touch of hop zing.  Sweet malts with very nice bready characteristics give way to tangy, spicy, bitter hops.  Full bodied.  Intresting finish with bitter chocolate and orange peel.  Very well balanced.  Hides the alcohol behind assertive, zesty hops.  Quite good.","Reno, Nevada, USA","NVBeer232"

3042,"2004-03-27",4.3,"I tried this on tap last night in Downingtown.  The aroma is typical of barleywines, with hints of port wine, brown sugar, honey, and apple jacks.  I drank it cold, not waiting fo it to warm, and found it to be representative of the style.  The alcohol is definitely there, but the brew is smooth.  I only had a 7 ounce sampler, but I imagine that a few pints of this would sneak up on you and knock you for a loop.  A great barleywine.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
3042,"2004-03-25",4.4,"Bottled on 11/18/03

Poured a clear amber with a collar of off white head, but I had to force pour to get it.

Aroma is a scosch alcoholy and sweet with both rock candy sugar and fresh brown sugar, sliced carmelized apple slices with a hint of cinnamon, young doughy raisin bread as well, even some very light hints of black peppercorn, definitely some candy bar like caramel as well.

Obvious, sweet malt flavor with an almost wheaty undertow, quite tasty, alcoholy, cinnamon, raisins, dried apricots (mixed with dried cherries?). Even develops a minty finish as it warms.

Mouthfeel is full, syrupy, coating, and perfect per style.

Drinkabilty on this sipper is hampered by the sheer magnitude of the beer, complexity that needs to be savored slowly, also the alcohol slows you down, and the slightly unbalanced sweet-heavy tone of the brew.

This is one magnificent barleywine. It's big, It's bad, It's a treat. I've got one laid down and I'll re-review in a year or so.","Champaign, Illinois, USA","jables"

There's a very big peach flavor in the finish...almost cloying and I'm not a huge fan of peaches to begin with.  Medium-heavy body, oily texture, soft carbonation.

3042,"2004-03-01",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2004 Nov 15 02 bottle.  Pours orange-red with virtually no head.  At 10 months:  Beautiful aroma of fruit, maple syrup, and maybe a touch of vanilla.  Silky, creamy flavours bring more of the same, with only a hint of hops and alcohol in the background.  A sweet barley wine that might be cloying if it werent so utterly delicious.  At 15 months:  The extra time in the bottle has really muted the maple syrup sweetness and presents a much more balanced beer.  The aroma still has sweet and fruity notes, but now has a more obvious orange zest hop character and alcohol presence.  Slightly drier fruitiness to the flavour with a less syrupy mouthfeel.  A grapefruity burst of hops at the finish, together with some alcohol sting.  A phenomenal beer at 10 months old.  With extra time in the bottle it is more balanced, but not necessarily betteralthough well see how my third, and last, bottle matures.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Wheatsheaf"

A perfect name, this, as it's it's the most perfect nightcap, certain to shut out anyone's lights. Lovely ruby red hue, just gorgeous, with a thick, creamy, tapioca-ish, eggnog-colored head. A dream to look at, and to sniff? Heavenly! Dark fruits pervade, cherries, grapes, berries, very much like the fruit of the vine, ripe, lush, arousing, with a brandyish feel, alcohol softly exuding, becomes more prominent further on...in a realm of it's own, this nose, near perfection. A pluckier thing on the tongue, full fruit, full malt, bits of caramel, too, thick, candyish sweetness, ever-present cognac feel, with the booze factor weighing heavier every inch in. Terribly sweet, and strong, ridiculously full in body and heavy on the palate, coats the senses well, and never leaves any doubt of it's solid, delectable flavor, it's unending twang, it's predominant feel of brandy-doused cherries, mixed up with malt and hops. A scintillating, stellar acheivement from one of America's top breweries. Among the top echelon of barleywines. A masterpiece.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

The alchohol is very well incorporated here, adding to the overall warmth and roundness but not distracting from the flavor. I actually don't think this is that superior to the Jubel2000 (or even the Tannenbaum) except for the vanilla, the vanilla here is just incredible.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

Aroma is fairly fruity with notes of pears, red grapes, apricot, faint caramel, touch of cherries and herbal hops. Flavor is malty, fairly chewy, light caramel, oak, vanilla, with touch of hops. Finish is fairly balanced. Palate is spot on. The thing I like the most about this is how easy it is to drink. This is probably the easiest to drink barleywine Ive had. 

Pours a beautiful deep orange color, with a small off white head and great lacing. Aroma is malty, sweet, with orange peel, a touch of caramel.

Victory Old Horizontal is a beautiful orange-red color with a fluffy off white head. The nose is fruity and spicy; peaches, apricots, pears, bananas, cinnamon and ginger. Hops move to the forefront of the flavor, but the fruity tastes are still there, overlaid on a rich blanket of crystal and caramel malts.

The nose was beautiful I have to admit with peaches, raspberries and whiffs of chocolate.  However, the body was not rounded at all and was a total hopfest while the malt only gave off cloying caramel attributes.  Finishing nice and bitter.  Not bad, but somewhat overrated in IMO.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

Melted butter over homemade waffles, chewing on a handful of citric hops, in fields of barley, as you gently nod off to sleep. Hops to no end here.

Big vanilla, bourbon, toasted malt, light pine, and dry fruit aroma. This beer is  very vinous and sticky smelling, if you what I mean. The initial taste was corn syrup sweet with a big alcohol kick upon the finish. It borders on being coy but the undertone of hops balance towards the finish saves the palate. Good fruity and smoky undertone. The mouthfeel is sticky, oily, and heavy. This is a very full-bodied beer. Very nice but almost too much for a tasting event, a sipping beer for sure.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

3042,"2003-12-07",4.5,"A really amazing barley wine that I have been waiting many years to try.  It really surprised me at the balance of malt and hops in this ale.

Poured out a brilliant amber-copper color, with tons of lacy head. It slid back to a thick mat of lace that covered the beer to the bottom of the glass.
Aromas of caramel malts, bready also. Slight biscuit taste to it, along with tons of malty goodness. Hops balance perfectly with the malts. Thick & chewy mouthfeel makes for a wonderful barleywine experience. Next year, Ill try to lay my hands on 2 cases. This is one kick ass beer gang, seek it out at all costs.","","Cobra"

3042,"2003-11-25",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2005 As it turns out my exhuberance for this one was quite irrational. The more I have had it, both fresh and aged, the more dissapointed I am. It seems to develop phenolic properties very quickly as it ages. It also seems to oxidize quickly. I am not sure if this is a recent trend with this beer s I first tried it in 2003, when it was very good fresh. The 04 vintage was no nearly as good. Bummer.  (10/4/9/5/19 - 4.7) 2003 Vintage - Sparkling clear ruby orange body topped by a gorgeous creamy off-white head. Lacing is superb. Aroma is massive floral-citric hops backed by a nice balance of spicy caramel malt. Wow this smells good! The flavor is also amazing, all the aroma develop into a burst of flavor on the palate. Bitterness and sweetness are perfectly balanced. The body is huge and thick, the 11% ABV is masked but it really warms the throat after the swallow.

Sweet throughout the drink, very thick and viscous all over the mouth, sticky and smooth... very well balanced.

In mouth, it's pretty complex, possibly the most well done american barleywine I've had to date excluding the HOTD jewels. Great flavor balance with a complex layer of hops making for an obvious bitterness that is never too much. The malt profile is also there and very balancing lending this an outstanding silky medium body to bring up all those malt subtleties. Notes of pears, oranges, resin, alcohol(wouldn't guess above 10% though), honey, vanilla, pepper.

Perfect balance of twingy, hearty, mildly earthed hops, bittering to the perfect height of satisfaction leading through to the smokey-like finish. This is a great beer to knock yourself out with.

3042,"2003-11-16",3.0,"Draught. First let me say that I'm not a big barley wine lover.  I am a big fan of Victory beers, so I decided to try it.  It looks like syrup, pours like syrup and tastes like a sweet syrup with an alcohol backbone.  Very warming, yet too syrupy to drink in any large amounts.  I don't think I'd try this again, although it didn't have any offensive flavors in it.  It just wasn't my favorite style.","Ocala, Florida, USA","mribm"

The predominant aroma is of Sherry (a bit of oxidation has happened).  There are sweet hoppy notes as well.  The tasted is not as oxidized as the aroma would suggest.  The flavor is lightly sweet, quite a malty beer at this point, though there is a hint of the hop flavor left in the beer.  It is still pretty bitter in the finish, which helps to balance the sweetness well.  The body of this beer is not overly thick, which for this beer is good.

The flavor is very balanced, somewhat sherry and cask like, but also hoppy but missing some of the character I noticed with some other Barley Wines.  Having said that, this one is much more drinkable!  The palate is well balanced with the flavor, just right.  The alcohol is nowhere to be found.

3042,"2003-09-29",4.3,"This is a reddish colored beer with amber highlights. It pours with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates. The remaining ring of foam leaves a very fine lace that gradually slides back down the glass to join the beer. The aroma is of cherries, alcohol, and a hint of apple. Very appetizing. The first sip presents a very thick feeling beer with sweet cheery flavors mingled with some hop bitterness and citrus flavors. The alcohol is very apparent in this young beer. After a few sips, some chocolate flavors become apparent, reminding me of chocolate covered cherries. The sweetness dominates this beer, and it is definitely a sipping beer.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"

I very nice beer, the best barleywine style ale that I have tasted.

Re-Rate - (7/28/04) 1998 vintage on draft at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia.  All I can say is unbelieveable.  This barleywine ages so well, all the flavors meld together it is sweet and smooth.  There is no wonder that they limit 2 glasses per patron.

Re-Rate - (7/28/04) 2001 vintage on draft at Victory Brewery.  Well, I must have gone to Old Horizontal heaven, they had 2001, 2002 and 2003 vintages on tap here tonight, however I have only tried the 2001 to compare with the 1998 I had earlier today.

3042,"2003-08-11",4.9,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2005 Origional Rating: 8/11/2003 :Smells very sweet and citrusy, much like many IPAs.  IT has a fine amber color and a little modest bit of head to it.  It has a very smooth taste to the barley malt and only get more smooth when it warms up.  The only down side to this in my eyes is that it makes me feel more tired than i should be after such a long day.
ReRating: 2.12.2004:   Bottle of 11/18/2003.  The aroma of this is wonderful, full of strong cherries, caramel, banana, and all sorts of malt sweeetness.  The flavor of this is something that ir rarely comprimised.  It has the perfect blend of sweetness, hearty malt, and sublt alcohol.  (Granted this is an aged bottle, but I had one of my 02 bottles and it was something out of this world.)
Another tasting of the 11.18.03:  I really feel wrong for not giving this top honors in my ratings.  So I am going to correct that. -9-4-10-4-20-
---Magical find of a sixer of 1.6.01for only $10.  Cracked open to a small bit of foam in the bottle.  No age signs so far.  Yeah, Im expecting a true gem here.  Just out of the bottle, aroma is intoxicatingly good.  Barley malt is flowing out in a sugary sweet way.  A touch of red apples and hay comes with it, as well as cold honey and fresh tilled earth.  The pour of this thing is still amazing.  It comes out a dark red with a soft layer of foam and trails of bubble feading it.  Just holding this up to the side of a sheilded halogen light makes it glow red.  Beautiful.   So, after 4 and a half years there is no touch of alcohol really noticable.  Soft taste, like a camprfire roasted marshmellow it just settles down on the tongue.  Malty caramel flavor seeps in all around my mouth.  Just fantastic.  The hops are still present at the very end, but its just telling me, hey, this still has a shelf life of another 5 years or so.  Christ.  What a find.  What a beer.  It just keeps getting better. -10-4-10-5-20-","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

3042,"2003-07-27",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2006 RERATE:
4/20/06.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, purchased at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA, 7/25/03. 2002 Vintage.  Rated blind.  Hazy, dull clay orange-meets-dark brown color.  Fairly slight head, creamy pale tan with a touch of orange and quick, somewhat beady lacing that falls mostly in large sheets.  Aroma is slightly fruity with zesty caramel-drizzled berries, crisp creme brulee crust, brown raisins/dates and brown sugar.  Fairly gentle overall, but sweetly inviting for every sip.  Flavor is surprisingly mellow caramel with a scratchy toastiness, soft raisin and dusty, brown, biscuity nougat.  Bitterness throughout which is wonderfully integrated with the caramelization-- very gentle.  Full body with a velvety carbonation that fluffs and soothes your tongue against the apparent alcohol prick.  Finishes with toasty, soft caramel dough, surprisingly dry, concealing a tinge of crystalline bitterness that feels like an expertly controlled twiggy flavor.  Sticky on the lips in a slick film.  The finish seems more complex, with more pronounced flavors *and* more variety, than the initial swirl.  There are *tiny* notes of oxidation (hints of metal in the nose and ""sogginess"" to the flavor), but I dont mind it much at all in a barleywine.  Especially one as terrific as this.  Eminently drinkable.  I love barleywine.  This is a great one. (9/3/8/5/18 - 4.3)

ORIGINAL RATING:
Poured out of bottle, purchased at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA, 7/25/03.  Pours to a rich amber color with moderate head, dissipates but good carbonation and decent lacing.  Delicious smell of fruity sweetness, barley, and even a little cinnamon.  Tangy bite on the first taste, nice full mouthfeel with good zesty fizziness and a little bite of bitter hops and spice on the end.  Flavor does not have much sweetness-- only enough there to fill out the mouthfeel and make it go down easy. . . and it works.  Surprisingly smooth and very, very tasty.  This is a very delicious barleywine. (9/4/8/15/16 - 4.2)

Upon sticking your nose into the glass, a mild cooked brocolli aroma emerges.  The palate is good, not cloying.  Very well done balance of malt and hops.

Yes really, ripe figs, like the ones you eat around Christmas, except this is July, all right, Christmas in July!! The palate is silky sweet, and oily. In the flavor, hopps are present, malt is prominent, honey, molasses, toffee, figs, I like Christmas figs in July.

3042,"2003-07-14",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2003 Body is a brilliant ruby color with dark amber undertones. Constant little bubbles build up to a white small head. Smells like clean malt, fruits, and sweet summer breezes. Feels syrupy on tongue. Taste starts very sweet, then is quickly removed.  Next comes malted fruits (apricots, grapes, apples, dates), warm spices and a remote yeastiness. Aftertaste is sweet fruit malts, a citrus hop flavor and negligible amounts of alcohol.  Enjoying this beer is a glorious experience. The ingredients were constructed with one another in perfect harmony; nothing is misplaced. Just watching the trace bubbles gently rising from bottom to top, and the sensational color of the body, would be enough. Couple that with richly, intricate flavors and a fantastic finish and this is easily one of the best barleywines available.

3042,"2003-06-07",4.4,"Cellar temperature: dark ruby in color with a medium-sized head.  Aroma is of caramel and sweetness.  Alcohol is warming.  This brew is a wonderful example of the style: simple grain bill and a good dosage of hops making for a beer that I really think would be more appropriate for January than June, but I couldn't resist.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
3042,"2003-06-02",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2005 11/98 vintage sampled on 12/10/05 (7,4,7,4,14): I never thought Id get to try this old of a vintage of this, but thanks to kp I was wrong.  Pours a lightly hazy dark copper with a thin-lacing white head.  Semi-sweet oxidized toffee aroma still has some mild hoppiness.  Body starts sweet and caramely with some nice dark fruity notes and complexity and good viscosity.  This has held up pretty well, but has definitely past its prime.

New vintage bottled on 12/14/04, sampled on 6/28/05: This is still one of the most balanced and flavorful barleywines Ive ever had.  After aging just over half a year, the hops still have a good piney presence in the aroma and nice bitterness in the body.  Malt is nicely caramely sweet and hides the alcohol better than most barleywines do. 

Rerate 12/21/04: Same vintage, aged two years:  Butterscotch is more prevalent in the aroma with more caramel dark fruity complexity.  Hops are still slightly noticeable.  Still very balanced and enjoyable.  This has aged very well.  An awesome barleywine! 

Rerate 12/8/03: Same vintage as earlier. The hops have seems to mellow down in the aroma giving way to more sweet caramel malt and some oatmeal.  Palate seems to have lost a little of its smoothness as the carbonation has become stronger.  Body still has a nice sweetness and the hop flavor is still in force.  I think the fresher, the better with this barleywine.  Although, even after a year its still delicious. 

6/2/03: (bottled on Dec 04 02) Huge hop bouquet upon pouring.  Color is dark copper with a thin covering of cream-colored head.  Floral hop aroma is complemented with hints of caramel malt and candi sugar.  Body is so remarkably viscous, smooth, and full with the softest velvety touch, that Id like to rate the palate a 6.  Flavors consist of a sweet and bitter onslaught of the senses.  There are enough hops that this could be mistaken as a double IPA.  Wonderful balance between the sweet almost chocolatey caramel malt and the floral and bitter, yet not overpowering, northwest hops.  There is even a soft red apple fruitiness.  Did I mention that my brain sensed the alcohol before my taste buds?  Finish is the culmination of sweet and bitter in just the right amounts with dry, woody attributes.  This is by far the best barleywine Ive had!  Im so glad I bought a six pack of this.  Expect re-rates about once a year.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3042,"2003-05-23",4.0,"Amber/ruby body, thin white head.  Alcohol, fruits and some floral tones in the nose, well rounded.  Malt presence is there, caramely sweet, real nice.  some grapefruits perhaps.  Real sweet flavor, floral and hoppy. GREAT balance, full and creamy, cleans up quickly, but flavor hangs in there well.  Supremely drinkable for an 11 % ABV beer.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
3042,"2003-05-21",4.3,"Complex, well-rounded aroma - pear, dark cherries, raisins, peppery spiciness, and rich malt.  Ruby-orange-amber in color, thin wispy head.  Flavor lacks some of the complexity of that aroma, but is very well-balanced between malt and spicy hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is smooth and full, with some slight warming in the belly, but overall the alcohol is well hidden.  Quite a nice barley wine - the complex aroma and outstanding balance really make this one stand out.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"

3042,"2003-04-29",3.9,"Very complex - different flavors encountered upon each sip.  Initial aroma - Cherry Bubble Yum -believe it or not. Pour - light amber - but what I notice as I drip the last drops in to the glass are the way the drops bead up when they hit the liquid - does the alcohol make it do that? As it settles, the flavor dissipates in my opinion - initally I enjoyed the way the hops crept their way into the raisiny, molaosses-like  maltiness - but it loses its luster after a while.  Ending - aroma - sweet molasses.  Still, a very good barley wine - but a tad overrated.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3042,"2003-04-29",3.6,"Took Austinpowers' advice and tried this head-to-head with Elizabethan Ale. Though this was more drinkable, it got its butt handed to it in terms of complexity. Tangy, smells like powdered orange drink mix -- like Tang with hops thrown in. Warming. A well-balanced strong amber ale, I guess.  Alcohol is masked rather well, not too sweet, not super bitter. Nice, smooth palate -- almost like it had used finings.  Medium bitter finish, which is citrus and woody.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"

I guess I rate this lower than others because it tasted of that 11% alcohol. I felt like I was drinking whiskey instead of beer. The beer did seem to mellow as it warmed and I got used to it.

3042,"2003-03-06",4.1,"What an awesome Barley Wine.  in the group of friends that was tasting it we had several different ideas as to what to call the aroma.  i was the odd man out, as normal, and had to call it a jack-o-lantern aroma.  it reminded me very strongly of the smell of pumpkins with candles in them.  there was a strong malt backbone and the hops gave just the right spicing to create this sense.  the copper boy held a surprisingly good head at these alcohol levels.  the flavor i found to be pumpkin like as well.  esters run rampant, hints of diacetyl.  the rich maltiness aded to the sense of the full bodied feeling and the fresh hop flavor accented the caramel flavors just right.","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"

3042,"2003-02-22",4.1,"2002, bottled.  Great robust deep reddish-orange, very thin creamy ring of foam lasts throughout.  Nose of brandy and figs is to my olfactory sense somewhat disappointingly weak.  Flavor of tobacco, caramel, grapefruit is powerfully tangy and full of alcohol and fire; definitely on the ""young"", hoppy side of barleywines.  Really comes into its own at the end, when a lovely smooth vanilla character manifests and the sharpness slowly fades away.  A mite overrated in my book, but still very good; I look forward to the bottles I have cellared in a year or two.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

3042,"2003-02-19",4.2,"A nutty almond aroma with a hint of goat cheese, a frothy tan head that thinly sheets the surface, and a deep dark clear copper color make for dangerously tempting beer. I get pecans and honey in the mouth, so sweet. Hops are big, but can do nothing to catch up to the toasty sweetness in this. Drinks like ginger ale and packs a wallop of a punch; or may be it tastes like punch and packs a sinister ale. I think I'm falling.","San Diego, California, USA","SpaceMonkey"

Nose: intense aromas of fruit/gingercake, some exotic fruit as melon or papaya, also hints of port wine.
Taste: hops first and after, but in between tantalising glimpses of frangipane or marzipan-covered fruitcake. Great balance (palate) as, being so hop bitter, it never really shows, unless by paying special attention to this.
Mouthfeel: even cooled down, this beer is rich and feeding, with a marvellous warming alcohol-effect.
Aftertaste: all the above fades out, ever so slowly, making one long for the next sip.

3042,"2003-02-11",4.0,"I'm beginning to think that Victory beers are like distillations, concentrations and partial reconstitutions of styles.  They take a beer concept (""barleywine"" or ""IPA"") and reduce it to basic components, and then, like a can of frozen concentrated orange juice, they only add two of the three cans of water that the label calls for when reconstituting it.  So you end up getting extra-strength flavor.  The Old Horizontal is the same effect--it is a nice rendition of the barleywine, classic barleywine flavors, through and through.  Not extraordinarily sticky, and a decent enough palate (keeps enough carbonation despite hints that it might fail on this dimension).  I didn't get much head, but this is 11% afterall.  It is unabashedly barleywine, a good dose of alcohol in the flavor, solid hop presence, a bit of bitterness, but good balance.  Good beer.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Aroma starts out with piney hop, then malty, caramel/toffee and fruity.  The flavor sort of seems to follow the aroma characteristics with a malty and hop filled start that turns to a drier finish than expected for a barleywine.  Fruity esters are in the back ground to hops.  It's very well balanced with a warming alcohol, full bodied beer, but it's slightly astringent, but not offensively so.

Plenty of malt and plenty of hops, plenth of caramel and toffee sweetness, with a clear slam of fresh bitter cherries.  Interestingly, we both tasted cherries, but were assured that, just as with the V10, there is no fruit or fruit juice added to this beer.  At just under 11% the warming presence of alcohol is very obvious, but the perfect balance can hide it and make the beer deceptively easy to drink.  This is not a session beer.

Body is surprisingly mellow and leaning towards syrupy. Light alcohol warmth and a mild lingering stickiness. Finishes with light alcohol and hops followed by more toffee, sugar and creamy malts.

The aroma is mildy alcoholic, but mostly dominated by what I can only describe as candied fruit, if that makes sense.  There is a subtle hop and alcohol presence in the flavor which is enjoyable on these long winter nights (but the alcohol is very well masked).  The most dominant aspects of the flavor include a heavy malty sweetness, and a deluge of fruit flavors (black cherries, grapes, raisins, and possibly strawberries), which combine to make this my new favorite barleywine.  The fruit and sweetness stick around in the finish for an astounding length of time after you swallow (if your dont brush your teeth, the flavor could probably stick with you for weeks).

Since DFH WWS 23% any amount of alcohol in a beer is going to taste muted.  Still the best barleywine Ive had so far.


Color is deep amber. Almost no head.  Smell was sweet and citrusy.  Taste was extremely complex and changed after warming up.  I first noticed a very sweet almost molasses-like taste witha  nice toasty maltiness with mild hop taste.  As it warmed there was plum and other caramel-like malt flavors with increasing hoppiness.

This beer rocks.
The aroma is malty and sticky sweet. Notes of black pepper and basement musty. There is a definite hop presence but, cmon. Although its brewed by Victory with their hoppy, Left Coast leanings, this barley wine has to be all about the malt, right?
This is a very dark, crystal clear amber beer. The head is medium-sized and off-white. Frothy head that is mostly diminishing with excellent lacing.
The flavor? I was right.. Malt!! Sweet, sticky, thick Malt!!

What a great color, the color beats foghorn and bigfoot i think. Deep red/ almost magenta.  taste stays with you, and is neither too cloying nor overpowering. yummmmmm. 9/4/10/5/19  2003 bottle.  Fresh.  Oh ya, been way too long.  Amazingly rich flavor of sweet barley, rich fruity alcohol esters.  Great english toffee flavor with tons of complexity.  Lovely grain-like alcohol/cognac mouthfeel and flavor.  I absolutely love this, but then English-style barleywines are my favorite. 9/4/9/5/17  Jan. 2004 bottle 14 months old.  Slowly working on trying the different vintages.  I look forward to trying this beer, as it has long been one of my favorites.  However, the 2004 didnt really do it for me.  Still a good pour, bottle conditioned, nice head and all.  The flavor was way too forceful, it seems like they have amped up the hops bitterness in recent years, or perhaps this bottle is still far too young.  Whatever the case, the flavors seemed blunt, and overbearing, lots of hops, sticky, strong caramel malt.  Aroma of strong alcohol, yellow candied fruits, sweet toffee.  Rather uninspiring, but hopefully just too young.  Looking forward to the 2002 bottle I have in my cellar. 8/5/8/4/15Dec 03 2004 bottle  Consumed 8/3/2005.  Incredible masking of alcohol, which is puzzling, as it seems rather filtered.  NO sediment whatsoever left in the bottle, and only a slight haze to the body.  Though it still looks a lovely auburn-magenta.  Aroma, however, had soily, resinous hops, dry earthy malt, brown bread and light toffee.  The aroma was not very intense after only 1 year.  Flavor was a bit of a let down as well.  Its even and drinkable, with a good integration of malt and hops, but the malt gets rather boring, the finish is way to quick.  Too much filtration on this beer now.  Caramel and toffee, with some yellow fruits, bitter hops and low carbonation.  It was good, though I think its gone down hill lately.  7/4/8/4/15Dec 2005 bottle consumed on 6/22/0718 months old and not too bad, I gotta say.  Pretty much the definition of the American barleywine and still with quite a bit of bitter, citric, leafy hoppiness.  The nose seems rather crudely yeasty, with dirty notes and a dull, bland, vitamin-like note.  But the malt is bready and caramel-like, with minimal roasty/toastiness.  Fruity hops and caramel dominate the beer.  Light alcohol, not too bad for its size.A real hard, woody, bready feel to the flavor, with low carbonation, light chocolate and mostly tons of hard caramel.  Bitter hoppiness, green and leafy tending mostly citric.  Still that liquerish finish, not as smooth as it was, with too loose a carbonation and quite decadent.

This beer is wild; it is so thick & syrupy that it doesnt splash when you pour from great heights (just watch out, the head continues to build long after you stop pouring!) Very good stuff.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3042,"2002-06-30",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2004 The first thing I noticed about this beer was the intriguing carbonation; there are small, effervescent bubbles which sparkle in the light, extremely fine bubbles which make up the thin head, and some larger bubbles that almost appear and behave like bubbles in a jar of honey.  Lace forms a delicate stipple pattern.  Color is a hazy, dark red-orange.  Aroma is very intoxicating itself -- alcohol, strong piney, earthy hops, a slight cherry note, huge, sweet malt, very complex.  Flavor is also quite complex, there is a wide variety of sweet fruits, an explosion of hop flavors, and the ever-present warmth of alcohol.  This echoes previous sentiments, but for all these things it is still quite drinkable.  Mouthfeel reflects some liveliness, overall feel is decidedly smooth and warming, though.   Flavor is outstanding.  Aftertaste is more complex than most beers entire flavor profiles.  Some sugariness here, not overly done and seeming to just add nicely to the overall balance.  This is quite a beer.    Very satisfying indeed.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Nice malty and slightly hoppy aroma with a hint of alcohol. Tastes moderately bitter with a powerful sweet, slightly caramelized malt flavor. The alcohol is imperceptible in the taste. Full bodied. A little hoppier than an English Barley Wine but certainly not as hoppy as a Bigfoot or Old Crustacean. This might be my new favorite Barley Wine. It certainly gives Old Foghorn a run for its money!","San Francisco, California, USA","mwsf"

Their Hop Devil and Storm King deserve the considerable praise that has been heaped upon them, and their Golden Monkey and Prima Pils are amongst my very favorite brews.  However,I think they missed the boat here. There are undoubtedly some wonderful flavors in here, with admirable fruit, but they are overshadowed by the hot, heavy handed approach.

3042,"2002-06-10",3.2,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2015 Bottle (2014 vintage...BB Dec 5, 2019). Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is medium to dark amber. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel, cookie), lightly hoppy (apricot), moderately yeasty (dough), with notes of cardboard, toffee. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, creamy/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

A pretty sloppy vintage to put it bluntly. Despite being bottled only a few months ago, its pre-oxidized...cardboard is pretty much the most dominant odor here, followed closely by raw yeast / vitamin B. Other than that theres really not much else going on in the nose...light tropical fruit and sugars. Its better in the mouth, where a good flavor balance (for this style) and mouthfeel work together to make it relatively drinkable. No fun to sniff, but a reasonable sipper.  Sadly, though, nowhere near as good as it was 5-10 years ago.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Citrusy, cidery aroma. Apple cider malt flavor, notes of oranges. Spicy body. Some sweetness, perhaps a touch of smoke. As perfectly balanced as you could ever ask for in such a big beer.  Strong sweet sugary finish. Very drinkable. Only complaint is the seemingly burnt/ sugary aftertaste as it warms.

It does not taste quite like any other barley wine that I have ever tried. It has the smallest amount of head and lace, just this side of none. Not too sweet, and does a great job with the eleven percent alcohol content.  Definitely has a cherry medicine flavor and nose to it that Im not sure if I like or not.  All in all, the sheer uniquness of the flavor and the great handling of the ABV make this a winner.  And as I just finished a big dinner with two beers, this after dinner one will surely have me horizontal soon.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
3042,"2002-03-09",3.1,"Uh-oh; Ruby Red in color; No head at all nor any lace. Alcohol is VERY upfront in this one. Medicinal. Lots of cherry Robitusin. Molasses. Palate thins quite a bit at the 3/4 mark. Cloyingly sweet with no balance. No attempt to hide the alcohol. I have another bottle and will definitely give this beer another chance, but as it stands now, this is woefully over-rated. RERATE: 3-9-02 (let bottle warm to nearly 65*) Smooth, very little effervescence. Lots of candy suger sweetness- malted burnt flavors also playing a huge role. Not as vinuos and thick as some other B-Ws that I have had. Alcohol is present for sure. Warming at the 1/3 mark. There is a degree of medicine flavors that really bother me- the cherry robituson is gone, but not by much. I am liking this better this time around, but I still sense very little balance.
