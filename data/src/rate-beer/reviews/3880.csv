3880,"2017-06-22",3.9,"Opaque, hazy orange juice color, small white head. Orange, pineapple, mango, and a little peach. Bittersweet but grows more cloying and bitter over time. Lightly carbed, a touch of astringency, and the body is a little heavier than desired.","California, USA","Ataraxia"

3880,"2017-05-28",3.7,"16 oz can. Pours a fully clouded gold with a white head. Aroma heavy on a mix of pineapple, grapefruit, and orange. Flavor led by the pineapple and grapefruit hops again. No real bitterness to speak of. Its certainly tasty, but I do wish it had a little more bitterness to support it.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"

3880,"2017-05-18",4.2,"Can shared. Thanks Spoon! Pours a hazy gold with a finger of foam on top. Lots of candied fruit, grapefruit, papaya, pineapple some strawberry. Fruit flavors go throughout. Finish is smooth with no perceived bitterness. Very true to the NE style. Diggin this one a lot!","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
3880,"2017-05-17",5.0,"This beer is incredible. The appearance is exactly as you would expect from this style of IPA, the aroma is bursting with tropical, juicy hops and the flavor is like hop juice, with a creamy, pillowy soft mouth feel. Perfection.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","joshrake40"

3880,"2017-05-07",4.0,"A great beer!! Aroma is complex, but not strong. A mix of pine with subtle citrusy variations. The appearance is awesome, a smoky golden look that appears cloudy and unfiltered but is clean. Taste is not overwhelming, very subtle with lots of complexity. Pine, citrus, nuttiness, earthy and malty all identifiable on their own. This will be on the go to list from now on. Best compliment I can give this beer is this; my girlfriend has completely disliked EVERY IPA that I've had her try, when she took a sip of this one her eyes lit up!

3880,"2017-04-22",5.0,"Whoa. This beer pours a beautiful haze with a thin head. Lacing stay consistent throughout. Talk about juicy and fruity with just a bit of hop. Its so so good. There is Two Hearted for me which is the apex of the piney IPA, and then there is M43 which is everything amazing about a juicy fruity and refreshing IPA.","Holland, Michigan, USA","Hopper8"
3880,"2017-04-21",3.7,"The aroma is pretty bland, non-descript. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange with mostly lasting white head and excellent lacing. The taste is a light bitter. The body is medium, the texture is creamy, the carbonation lively and the finish bitter. Agood beer!","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","LearninBeer"
3880,"2017-04-13",4.0,"Draft to pint. Looks good; a very cloudy banana skin with eggshell head. Smells good too; tropical fruit and citrusy hops with a moderately bittersweet backbone. Tastes like it smells with a pleasantly bitter medium-bodied mouthfeel. Legit.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3880,"2017-04-13",4.3,"16 ounce can into tulip glass; no can dating, but was just distributed this week. Pours opaque hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, wheat, white bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. A little muted. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, wheat, white bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, wheat, bread, light honey, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 6.8%. Overall this is an incredible NE IPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Very dank/juicy hops, with nice malt balance. Just a little too bitter/drying on the finish, and not as bold/vibrant on the aromas as I hoped for. This is still extremely impressive, and highly enjoyable for the style.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3880,"2017-04-13",4.8,"Best beer in a long time smooth refreshing and different. Juicy taste and pours nice and thick. Its complexity is refreshing and not typical of a standard IPA.","Grosse Pointe, Michigan, USA","WC3"

3880,"2017-03-27",4.0,"Can from the recent release. Pours an extremely hazy, opaque orange with a quickly dissipating, white head. Aroma is citrus forward: Orange, mandarin, some dank notes underneath. Taste is similar. Juicy citrus. Moderate bitterness. Light+ to medium bodied; texture is slightly thin; carbonation is soft. As of today, a top two Michigan IPA for me.","Michigan, USA","Mr_Abner"

3880,"2017-03-01",4.2,"16 oz. can from seeswo via Mark - thanks, fellas. Pours a really hazy light orange color with a finger of white head that settles into a ring and thin film while lacing the glass sloppily. Huge citrus fruits in this one, especially orange, with melon, pineapple, wheat, a bit of weed, tea, sweet oats and dough, and a little grass and hay. Light-bodied, with a juicy, tea-like, lightly bitter mouthfeel and modest carbonation. This is excellent. Really fun, tasty NEIPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3880,"2017-03-01",5.0,"Do this blind with any of your favorites from NE. The results will shock you.

A: Huge citrus hits first, then melds into a slightly herbal tone, then back to citrus. HUGE.

A: Poured from a can, one finger thick almost stark white head. Tight. The haze of the straw to gold is impenetrable.

P: Well carbonated, Fruit with a touch of malt. The shade of a lingering bitterness reminds you that this is, in fact, beer. Very crisp and powerful. 

Overall: Damned near perfect representation of this pseudo style. Again, do it blind with the beers you line up for in the East.","","Blerpy"
3880,"2017-02-25",4.3,"Pour on tap at the brewery, murky golden yellow pour with white head, aroma brought notes of big tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, some slight spice, nice light biscuity notes. Taste was similar with big fruity, orange/citrus notes, more tropical and stone fruit into some slight biscuit but still with a nice mouthfeel, finishing slightly bitter. Excellent.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
3880,"2017-02-21",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2017 Can. pours hazy dark orange with offwhite head. Like a glass of high pulp orange juice. Aroma is Fruity (mango, papaya grapefruit) hops. Taste is sweet and bitter orange and mango with a mango papaya finish. Really good and wish i had another.

3880,"2017-02-18",4.3,"On tap at Old Nation. One damn good IPA. Pours hazy and ride with juicy hop aromas. Bursting with hop bitterness with rounded mouthfeel.","East Lansing, USA","Msdrbeat"
3880,"2017-02-13",4.1,"Can from a trade. 6.8%, and 65 IBUs. 01/20/17 (less than 4 weeks on it), but fairly fresh. Pours properly hazy orange NE color, white head. Aroma is pineapple heavy, mango, and tangerine. Little dank. Flavor is pine, orange, pineapple, mango. pretty juicy, very minimal maltiness. A little heavier bitterness than some other NE IPAs, but hey, this is still great. Maybe a little bit more dry hopping or less bittering hops would help? It almost seems like they were making a NE IPA and doing great but stopped at some point and decided not to continue because the citrus flavor falls off a bit halfway through. Also, body isnt quite as pillowy as some other NE IPAs, but not far off either. Overall, Hallelujah! A Michigan IPA without a very malty body. Maybe the best (top 2 for sure) Michigan IPAs Ive had. Its really well done, and if you gave this to me without me knowing it, Id assume this was brewed in the NE. I really hope other Michigan breweries follow suit. It doesnt hold up against some of the better OH, TreeHouse, or Trillium beers, but this guy is great. Very pleased. Really hoping to see more of this. I feel this would be a 4.0 from NE, but just b/c almost no other Mich. breweries are doing this, Im bumping it up to 4.1. Well done, Old Nation! Cheers!","New York, USA","SG111"
3880,"2017-02-09",4.8,"M43-03 (canned 1/20/17 which is less than 3 weeks ago). Hazy look like New England should be. Remarkably juicy and creamy. Citrus fruits, grapefruits, lemon (bitter-sour lemon). High, short and pleasant bitterness, in my taste. Perfectly low carbed. Worth to mention a brilliant head and lacing. That is quality. Possibly the best IPA I have ever had.","POLAND","NightHawk91"
3880,"2017-01-27",4.1,"On tap: The aroma consists of moderate citrus and tropical fruits with mild grapefruit. Its a cloudy dull golden-orange with a small white head that fades to a thin film outlined by a soapy ring. There is a good amount of sticky webbing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate citrus and tropical fruits. The finish has light-moderate grapefruit with a touch of lemon. Its light-medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3880,"2017-01-27",4.0,"16oz can pours a murky sunflower gold with some lacing, sticky white head. Nose is nice, grassy, pine, a little paper, some bright chive/onion character, stinky melon. Flavor is nice, more of the melon, mango here, then the grass and onion. Medium bodied, dry finish.

3880,"2017-01-09",4.2,"Draft. The pour is cloudy as can be and lighter in color. The aroma is a hop bomb, citrus. The taste is really a juicy ipa. This is as close to an east coast ipa as I've had outside the east coast.
