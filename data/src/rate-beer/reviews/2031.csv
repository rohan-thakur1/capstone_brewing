2031,"2015-02-18",4.2,"Draft - Sweet chocolate icing, rich and decadent. Deep maroon with a decent beige head. Cherry and chocolate with a bit of cram. Unbelievable. How do they do this?","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2031,"2015-02-14",4.0,"Draft at the brewery. Had time for a quick stop and had this at the suggestion of the waitress. Pours a jet black. Cannot comment on the head because by the time it was served, there was just beer with minimal lacing. Nose is chocolate forward, hints of roastiness. Taste is milk chocolate, sweet with no bitterness at the finish. This beer is dangerous! The 8.8% ABV is extremely well hidden! Great beer!","Valrico, Florida, USA","RLiddell"

2031,"2015-01-28",4.0,"Draft at the brewery. Poured a dark brown color with a small tan head. Aroma had a nice solid touch of chocolate. This tastes like a nice slice of German chocolate cake, with some light coconut notes. Solid.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
2031,"2015-01-27",4.0,"Draft... This beer rocks!... Pours clear and black with crimson sparkles when held up to the bright, south Florida sunshine. Small, fizzy, off-white head thats gone faster than you can say ""quick."" The aroma is basically the same as Nib Smuggler - chocolate and vanilla are featured here. Im pulling nearly no coconut from the glass. Full-bodied and velvety with airy carbonation. The flavor is roasty, chocolaty and a touch carbonic, offering dark chocolate, vanilla and BAM! There it is: a modest nuance of coconut. Lightly bitter, chocolate and vanilla finish. World-class brew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2031,"2015-01-24",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Dark brown pour with a tan head. Chocolate and cola aromas. Somewhat bitter chcocolate notes with cola and sasparilla highlights. Hints of coconut. Good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
2031,"2015-01-23",3.8,"12 onces sur le zinc. À loeil, bien semblable à la Pirate. Le nez est très riche mais aucunement écurant. Noix de coco, chocolat doux, pacanes, notes rôties, taces de café aromatisé à la vanille. En bouche, cest bon comme un dessert maison. Étonnamment digeste. Au palais, la bière est pétillante et huileuse. La finale est douce et longue. Un véritable gâteau liquide.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
