4322,"2014-05-19",3.7,"From BA review from 2-14-12 -

Served in 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a deep red nearly brown color with a nice billowy off white head. The head faded slowly giving a nice bit of lacing.

Smell  The smell is a nice mix of dried fruit and hoppiness. The hops, which really are most prevalent upfront in the nose, are mainly pine in nature with some earthy and floral hop aromas. The fruit, largely composed of cherry, raisin and prune, then comes more toward the middle and end of the aroma. Its a nice balance between sweet and hoppy. 

Taste  A bit of hoppiness is the first thing to be detected. A bit more subtle then the nose would suggest, with pine and an ever so light citrus. A sweeter flavors mixed with a roasted malty flavor enter toward the middle of the taste; with the sweet a mix of dark dried fruits. While the hops that are present initially begin to fade the dried fruit flavor comes in making up for their loss. A nice transition.

Mouthfeel  A nice thicker feel to the body, which coats the mouth while drinking. The thickness seems to make it more bock or stout like. The only problem is a little bit of an over-carbonation for the thickness of the body. The body is soothing while the carbonation is more invigorating. The two competing with each other leaves something to be desired in the mouthfeel.

Overall - It is an interesting beer. Moderately hoppy with some nice fruit flavors. The only real complaint is a lack of complementation in the mouthfeel, but otherwise however it is quite a good brew.","","Darkmagus82"

4322,"2013-12-03",3.3,"12 ounce can

I am not sure where this came from but I found it in the back of the fridge ready to be ticked. A decent strong ale is nothing special but at least it was only a single can. Not bad enough to pour down the drain this is an average strong ale at best.

Aroma / Appearance - The rich chestnut base is suffocated by a heavy head that then falls to a thin veneer. Caramel, fig newtons, plums, and a heaviness of boozy malts are a mixture of both positive and plain.

Flavor / Palate - The heavy malt detracts from an otherwise solid profile. Figs and dates, while fine at first, eventually turn into a sticky cloying mess. Rich like a dessert wine the finish is proof that sometimes less is more. Toning this down would have made a much more enjoyable limited release than just trying to go big for the sake of it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4322,"2013-08-07",3.7,"Rated from backlog. Pours copper with beige head. Hoppy and fruity aroma with a hint of roasted malts and chocolate. Brown sugar, caramel and roasted malt in the taste together with bitterness from hops. Very well balanced.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Nische"
4322,"2013-05-26",3.5,"Appearance:
Clear burnished garnets and cherry woods. A thick khaki head lingers as a thick layer while a few swirls produce some spotty lace. Entices me to drink of her depths.

Nose:
Spices follow into toast then dark fruit pits. Prunes and raisins with cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled apple skins. Plump plums. Spice continues to tickle the back of my nose.

Palate:
Clean and Belgian-inspired. Nutmeg and cinnamon are everywhere without dominating. Apple and plum skins in the back of each swallow. Tannic finish of woods, leather, skins, and pits. Meaty dates and prunes in the middle add a pleasant chewy full-bodied mouthfeel and presence. The dry finish is nice in this sense because it keeps my palate from being overwhelmed from the sweetness and spice.

Final Thoughts:
Not what I was expecting but a delightful quaff nonetheless. For as intense as the flavors were, I was surprised by how balanced and even the body was. Whatever you personal thoughts are on war, you cant go wrong with this beer from the 21st Amendment Brewery. Good stuff.

It is brewed with Dates, an old fruit from palm trees originating in the Middle East, which tells me this could be what beer tasted like a long time ago.

There is a good balancing bitterness from slightly piney hops.  Full bodied with a good bit of soft carbonation and a medium to long bready then slightly bitter finish.

Transparent ruddy dark-amber body with a medium off-white head.  Fair lacing.  Starts with a bit of caramel and toffee malty character.  Becomes a little more toasted in the middle.

The flavors include caramel, toffee, dates, plums, floral hops, spices and peated malts. Its pretty light bodied and the carbonation is pretty low, but there is an amount of thickness that throws me off which reminds me of a Scotch Ale. The flavor and mouthfeel for that matter remind me of a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy, so much so that I would classify this ale as such.

4322,"2012-02-10",3.7,"Pours a deep amber color, almost reminiscent of dark honey--just beautiful.  Thin off-white head that persists for some time.  Aroma is quite restrained, smelling mostly of a non-specific fruity sweetness.  Taste, however, is a different matter.  An upfront sweetness of dried fruit (though, again, its not specifically dates) gives way to a piney hop flavor.  The real kick, however, the overpowering of flavor of alcohol--so strong, youd swear you were drinking vapor--that comes in midway and persists into the aftertaste.  For a while, I was wondering where the malts were, but as the beer warmed, some general breadiness became discernible.  Mouthfeel is watery, with a lively carbonation.  In sum, this beers an interesting twist on English ale.  Theres a complexity that cant be denied, and despite all of the different flavor profiles, it somehow works.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","elektrikjester"

The aroma had moderate molasses and caramel; moderate grapefruit, orange and lemon hops; raisin; plum; prune and dates. The initial flavor was moderately sweet; lightly bitter and lightly acidic; while the finish was heavily sweet and slightly bitter with a fairly long duration. There was dark fruits, prune, date, plume, raisin, citrus hops (orange, lemon and a little grapefruit), caramel, a little pine hops, molasses and tea.

Pineapple and grapefruit lead the way but there is a nearly equal amount of sweetness that masks much of the hop flavor.  The palate is much thinner than expected but probably makes this easier beer to drink and much less of a sipper.  My only real disappointment is that the hop aroma had me expecting a hopier beer.

4322,"2011-12-31",3.6,"Location: 12 oz can from Buy Rite, 12/31/11, My 2011th Rating will double as my last rating of 2011.


Aroma: It has some sweet notes, dark fruits (date, raisin), caramel, earth, citrus, and floral hops

Appearance: The pour is mostly clear brown color with a strong red hue and a small beige head

Flavor: Moderately sweet flavor, dominated by the dark fruit, and balanced by a light-mid hop bitterness

Palate: The body is medium, with average-to-soft carbonation, and it has a fairly clean, slightly dry finish

Overall Impression: 
I cant help but enjoy odd number games like making my last rating of 2011 my 2011th rating.  Anyway, beyond my dorky number game thing, and on to the beer, this one is quite creative.  I enjoyed the newspaper look to the can, and the cleverly written article that adorned it.  My overall impression of the beer itself is fairly positive.  This one starts off with a somewhat subtle, but interesting and fairly complex nose.  I found it to be a pretty decently balanced offering that has some nice components to it, and I thought it drank pretty well as well.  This was a nice, interesting, and somewhat unique offering that Im glad I got to enjoy, and made for an excellent 2011th rating, and last rating for 2011!

4322,"2011-12-26",3.3,"12 ounce can - $2.79 at Olde Crabapple Bottle Shoppe in Alpharetta, Georgia. Canned on: 10/26/11.

Appearance: Pours a clear, deep amber-brown body with a finger or so of light, light beige foam. Acceptable lacing.

Smell: Fragrantly spicy hops with a firm backing of dry-hopped grassiness and blistering resins atop biscuity, pale malts and a hint of dark fruit and chocolate powder and caramel (the caramel only as it warms a smidge).

Taste: Toasty Munich malts given a thin brushing of sweet-tasting caramel. Crumpled biscuit tops. A slim portion of bitterish chocolate. Any initial sweetness is low and quite brief. Spicy, earthy, resinous, grassy hops with a full bitterness that embodies the majority of the overall taste. Maybe a hint of dates, but could just as easily be some esters from the English yeast used. Warming alcohol presence, though not intrusively so. Finishes quite dry, a little warm, and with a lingering spicy, bitter quality.

Medium bodied with a dry, bitter hop presence up front thats countered by subtle citrus, sweet malt and dark fruit.

Malt profile provides sweetness with hints of caramel, toffee and nut which are complimented by some date and fig. The dark fruits add another dimension but there is a bit too much going on for my tastes. The high ABV is nicely masked but the odd addition of dark fruit notes give it an unpleasant chalky feel.

4322,"2011-12-03",2.6,"12 oz. can from the U-Village QFC. Frothy head sits on top of a hazy ruby brown body. Looks decent to me. This has a pungent pine and citrus hop aroma. Touches of the dates hit my nose, every now and then. To me, this doesnt really strike me as spice/herb/vegetable beer. Flavor is rather uninteresting. Im getting the aforementioned hop aromas, when I sip this sucker, but they dont last long. Mild touches of the date come through, but they dont offer much. Im not really impressed here. Its rather dull, and uninteresting. The only saving grace is the hop profile, but even that is lacking.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
