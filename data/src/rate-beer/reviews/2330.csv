What a complex brew this is, it keeps on developing. Its hard to believe with what Im drinking right now  that Oerbier tasted even better with the Rodenbach yeast in the past so now I got to taste some of these earlier brews as a comparison.

2330,"2016-01-06",3.9,"Ok, jai affaire ici à une bière dont le profil ne mest pas familier. La bière est brune et se gonfle de mousse de manière chaotique et démesurée lors du service. Je dois être très prudent! Cette mousse ne tient pas vraiment cependant et en peu de temps, elle nest plus quun souvenir. Lorsque japproche le verre de mon nez, je suis frappé par des arômes sûres et violentes. Rien à voir avec le profil des bières sûres sauvages classiques. Non, lattaque est pourrie. Cependant, une fois cette attaque passée, de douces saveurs de fruits se développent doucement sous mes narines intriguées et admiratives. Un prune fabuleuse se marie a une cerise noire qui sont accompagnées de fruits plus délicats telles la clémentine et le noyau dabricot. Un nez prodigieusement complexe! En bouche, une effervescence beaucoup trop agressive pour moi vient gâter la dégustation car je peine réellement à laisser couler le liquide dans ma bouche sans heurts. Beaucoup dalcool je dois le mentionner, mais au-delà de ces deux défauts (importants pour moi cela dit) le liquide est aussi complexe quil létait au nez il y a à peine un instant. Une texture moelleuse supporte une quantité fulgurante de fruits noirs et confits. Un jus de dattes et de pruneaux (sans ses effets relâcheurs je lespère!) maturé avec savoir, sagesse et intelligence. Le fruit confit, lorange et une fraise. Jaurais sans doute pu donner une note parfaite à cette bière si ça navait pas été des deux importants défauts mentionnés plus haut. Peut-être ma bouteille a-t-elle mal vieilli? Il faudra que je déguste à nouveau car je suis visiblement ici devant un produit dexception.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Pours a dark brown color with ember hints in it, revealing a giant, spongy head.

Smells of spicy wheat, wood bark and rock sugar. Although it inherits a gentle sweetness, the beer got an earthy, almost oaken balance to it, featuring ripe red grapes and tart dextrose. 

Has a higher, lively carbonation to it, wrapping up the sweetness with a bubbly, metallic carbonation.

Tastes of older, caramel soaked malts, topped off by fermented grapes, a decent sourness and rock sugar on top. Toffee turns more profound among the bubbly carbonation, coming up after the swallow, thinning the profound earthiness a bit, while maintaining its balance. Finishes clean, with a sour note among rock sugar and caramel, while the carbonation dies down to a likeable minimum.

While it certainly features a well pronounced maltiness, the beers sweetness defines the overall taste of this beer. It doesnt turn cloyingly sweet, due to the beers convincing balance, while it certainly lacks an appealipng depth of flavors to me, prevented by the omnipresent sweetness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Cè un finale leggermente amaricante (frutta secca) ed etilico ma non basta a riportare il necessario equilibrio. Questa Oerbier si beve abbastanza bene, lalcool cè e riscalda ma non fa sentire troppo la sua presenza.","roma, ITALY","leghorn99"

Quite a nice BSDA, if a bit on the pricey side for where I got it. Very mild considering the beefy ABV, almost sherry-like and quite good for sipping. Almost feels like theres a little brett in there contributing to the mild tartness, but its quite restrained. Sweetness is similarly restrained, and kept well in check by the pleasantly prickly carbonation. Certainly much better than the amateurish label might have you expecting, and having read their writeup, Id like to cellar some for future experimentation. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Very estery and yeasty, elegant and inviting aroma; overripe grapes and peaches, raisins, brown bread, port wine, caramel, floral hops. Sweet onset, not cloying candi sugar sweetness, very estery and fruity, Belgian yeastiness, soft mouthfeel with spritzy carbonation, nice caramelly malt sweetness, evolving into a lightly spicy, yeasty, florally hop bitterish finish with agreeable warming, port-like alcohol and a hint of roasted bitterishness - which, I hasten to add, wasnt there when I first tasted this, the recipe clearly has been altered a bit some years ago to approach a more Scotch-style ale, but then this seems to have been its original form so I guess it has been kind of returned to its own roots.

Kastanje-brun ufiltreret stærk belgier med kæmpe offwhite skumkrone på 7-8 cm. Tætskummet og svinder ganske flot til snelandskab og senere til et par millimeter kant og overflade. 
Dejlig aroma af diverse malte og belgisk gær. Lidt fjern syrlighed fra noget ubestemmelig frugt. Alkohol.
Fantastisk dejlig smag. Let syrlig, men ellers sød og bitter i meget fuldendt balance. Kompleks øl. Det syrlige ligger gemt i det bitre gennem hele smagsbilledet og giver øllet et særligt indtryk. Opsummering: Mellem til kraftig bitter, mellem sødme og let syrlig.

Aromas of red fruit, soap, vinous, sweeter barleys malts, raisin, rice, oatmeal, toffee, flowery barleys, hints of chalk, toast, toast, bread and toasted sticky herbs.
Flavours of brown sugars, caramelised barley malts, raisin, prunes, toffee, bitters, spices (a teeny tiny hint of alcohol), some toast, red fruit, vinous, light floral and light herbal, some malty bread, yeast and some sticky sweets but overpowered by the bitter and spicy tones.
Aftertaste bitter, some spicy tones, toast, red fruit, sticky sweets with floral tones and bread.
Low carbo, soft creamy foamy lightly blown mouthfeel, full body and a creamy texture.

2330,"2013-03-13",4.0,"Reviewed 3/4/13. Bottle says 9%. 11.6 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a very dark burnt sienna color. The head is a rather attractive two finger cream color. It features a soft, creamy layer over top some rather thick-looking bubbles. Retention is excellent - even after a couple of minutes the head is one finger high - and a good layer of lacing is left on the glass.

S: Okay, this is interesting...not only are the usual BSDA suspects quite evident (dark fruits, chocolate, pears), a sour undercurrent rests wonderfully below that. I really enjoy the tart cherries, sour apple esters, and general acetic quality as well. The complexity of the aroma isnt overbearing, either.

T: Compared with the first inhalation, the sour quality is far more restrained here, taking on more of a lactic tone. Sadly, the coinciding cherry esters are also downplayed. For a brief glorious moment, sour cherries initiate the profile, before giving way to a chocolaty yet dry midtaste. And now a THIRD element comes along that I didnt foresee - hoppiness. The finish is full of grassy, earthy hops, with touches of leather as well. Certainly, its complex; but at the same time, the complexity is cohesive rather than messy - Im impressed how well balanced the seemingly clashing elements work together. Even if the lack of acetic sourness is a letdown for me, the only thing really wrong here is the slight paper quality in the aftertaste.

M: This one is dry, more so than many others in the style. Given the sour/hop bend of this, it isnt surprising. Lush, creamy, and silky arent terms Id use to describe the texture - more like papery, coarse, and rough - but the firmness also helps make the carbonation seem a little lighter than what it is. I find its semi-abrasive feel endearing, to be frank.

O: A BSDA thats sour and hoppy? Interesting. A BSDA thats sour, hoppy, and isnt a clusterfuck? Now you have my attention. Okay, it doesnt work perfectly and isnt the most chuggable offering...but damn, its just so much fun to sip and contemplate over.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Pomegranate. Plums. Caramel apples. Pecan pie. Dried cranberries. Candied orange peel. Wildflower honey. Really great stuff. One of my two ""go to"" Belgium bottles (Pannepot being the other one.) This one is nice because it always changes a bit batch to batch and year to year. Also ages quite well. Some years have been better than others. The 2012 vintage is looking great. Start with it a little chilled then watch how the flavor develops as it warms. Not as dense as the ""Extra Export"" or aged ""Still Nachts"" but the regular Oerbier always seems the most fun!

Having on draft for the first time. Juicier than in the bottle but still maintains its rich dark malty goodness. My understanding is that De Dolle may have changed brewery locations in the past few years leading to similar but more consistent and refined versions of its recipes.

2330,"2012-03-19",5.0,"Just the reason why Ive first connected ratebeer, to find a coment about
this beer. What ? A score at 99 ? Im dreaming, or perhaps to much beer ....  Noooooo.  Its true.  A score without doubt. 
The dolle brouwers are completely crazy !! (OK its the meaning of their names !!! )  They do one of the best belgian beer, and they do nothing to put it a business on the market !!
The same thing in the States, ans you have a national co in 3 months,
and a cotation on Wallstreet !!!!  (Yes)
But its Belgium, a little land, so little you cannot see it on the map !!
(OK; its a world map !!!) And in Belgium , they do things as they think it
must go on, so.... No problem, we have a good beer more....
Blague à part, superbe bière, sans fausse note, a true musical score,
just as a song of Avantasia...
Arômes dabord de cidre classé, fût de chêne, sureau et réglisse. 
Première bouche sur un mix dOrval et Chimay rouge ... très belle entrée 
en matière... Disons : on peut faire plus mal !! En plus,  belle longueur.
Second nez très joli entre une trape et une ale .
Deuxième bouche dune belle bière ""cossue"". (La levure est très originale, mais ceci demanderait trop de commentaires ..)
Troisième bouche avec une pointe de lamertume des bières brunes
flamandes bien connues (Rodenbach, etc.), mais très fine et délicate.
Dans la longueur et la finale, beaucoup de tenue avec du côté vineux
et du porto (un peu, pas trop). Comme ils disent eux-mêmes, ce nest
pas petit, cest ""nat en straf"", cest-à-dire ""wet and strong"".
OK, je suis dautant plus daccord quil faut faire une remarque ......
IMPORTANTE : le degré alcoolique de cette bière est de 9 % abv, et 
non pas 7,5 , comme il est indiqué dans le ""commercial description"".
Preuve encore quen Belgique on est généreux, et que lon donne tout
ce que lon peut..... Merci aux Dolle (fous !!) pour cette merveille....

The finish is long, somewhat drier and spicy with wood and hops. On the palate, it is medium-full in body with a dryish texture, average carbonation and a hint of astringency. Overall, this is a great Belgian ale with a beautiful malty sweetness and delightful Belgian fruity and floral notes. Delicious. 2011-12-19","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

2330,"2011-04-09",3.5,"Started talking to another BAer about this and then found it the same day.

Beautiful frothy 4 finger head with an aggressive pour.
Appearance is a bit cloudy, amber, iced tea middle color.

Froth settles into nice foam.

Nose is fairly typical. Lots of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, citrus mixed with fruit and a hint of moss.

Taste is a bit maltier than expected. Lots of Earthy, yeasty bread overtones. Some phenolic banana, and hints of fig. As it oxidizes Im getting some cloying sourness.

Finish and aftertaste is a little dry, sour.

Feels syrupy and fairly high carbonation.

Not as ""hot"" as many fresh Belgians. Aging could mellow it a bit, but it doesnt seem carbonated enough to last more than a year or two before going full-on treacle.

A - Deep hazy chestnut brown with a slight orange hue. A bit larger than average, bubbly, light beige head. Average retention with a good sticky layer of lacing left.

S - Fairly vinous taste with a lot of raisin and some grape along with some other dark fruit. A touch of licorice and a little tartness. Fairly well spiced with a hint of alcohol present.

T - Initial taste has a good amount of malt, which quickly gives way to a spiced raisin flavor (along with some other dark fruit). Mid sip has a lot of dark fruit and spices, some yeast and candi sugar, a hint of warming alcohol, and just a bit of earthy and hoppy flavors. Finishes with the dark fruit (particularly raisin) and spice.

M - Medium, starting to make progress toward full, body. A bit above average carbonation. Fairly smooth, but is a bit tingly and warming on the finish.

D - Good drinkability. The flavors are well balanced, and taste good with enough complexity to keep it interesting. The slightly tart and vinous aspect is nice and makes me want to sip on some more.

Notes: Nice BSDA that has a bit more tart and vinous flavors than other similar beers. Very well spiced, put the vinous/tart flavors cut that a bit. Full of raisin and grape like flavors. Good, solid beer to drink from a good brewery. Nice for a slightly different beer if you want a BSDA. Definitely worth a try.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Carbonisation is a bit too harsh in my opinion. Medium body that combined with the sourness gives it a very good drinkability.
Conclusion: Interesting character, good aging capabilities.","Leuven, BELGIUM","BigMomma"
2330,"2010-01-10",4.1,"Serving date: 2009-03-18. Best before: end of August 2009. Served in tulip.

Dark brown with deep red hues. Slightly Cloudy. 5 cm head, pale brown color, uneven, airy and sparkly. Plenty of lacings.

Fruity aromas of cherries and apples up front. Wood, spices (cloves?) and a little twang from the alcohol. Very big and deep small, rather vinous.

Plenty of semi-sweet fruit flavors. (cherries, red grapefruit, currants). It goes a little tart in the middle, but it quickly develops some more rustic flavors - wood, yeast (not very distinct), rye bread, hints of nuts, earth, chocolaty notes and faint mint. The finish is dry for a second and has some light mineral flavors, fruit pits, grape skin and a slightly too prominent twang from the alcohol. Plenty of vinous flavors linger on. All in all a fantastic smell with big vinous flavors. It almost resembles red wine every now and then.

Creamy, yet semi-dry in the finish. Quite high levels of carbonation. It slides really easy over the tongue. The mouthfeel seems very well suited for the overall characteristics of the beer.

A fantastic beer with great complexity. I really like the vinous character of this one. The only thing stopping it from getting top grade in taste is the slightly too prominent taste of alcohol in the finish.

2330,"2009-12-31",3.8,"Poured into a Duvel glass. Huge gusher, which I had prepared for given the fact that the other two De Dolle beers Ive had have been gushers. The mere yeast turbulence/pressure fluctuation from opening and pouring the beer filled not only the glass but the bottle with ever-rising foam. The beer is a deep, almost-purple brown with a ludicrous topography of beige suds that leaves lace chunks everywhere. The aroma is caramely at its base with accents of souring fruit, cocoa powder, cola, sherry, and a coppery metallic note. Flavor is sweet and spicy with a solid warming alcohol presence. Cinnamon, citrus, slight acidity, toffee, dark bread. Full-bodied with (obviously) too much carbonation, but with a little time it gains drinkability. A nice rich sipper.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

A sweet, malty, and very mildly sour brew, notes of tart berries, jujube candies, cinnamon, pepper, and a darker, earthier side as well. Palate is Rich and in the bready/cakey range, with more spics, plus both tropical and winter fruits, plus mild berries. Finish is bananas, lemons, and apples, plus marmalade and burnt toast. Very fine, Champagne-like carbonation. Rich and gorgeous, but also very drinkable.

2330,"2009-11-30",4.2,"A nose of chocolate, black currant, alcohol and yeast. Taste is of red wine, raspberries, cherries and dried, fermented fruit. Its acidic, and the finish is a bit dry, and has a pinch of alcohol in it. Halfway through the taste, a kick-ass complex bitterness comes out and dominates. Its not a hoppy, flowery bitterness, but rather a ""green"", raw, plant-like bitterness. Like chewing on the white stuff between a grapefruits pulp and peel.
This brew is surprisingly tart and sour! Strange, as it tasted more like a regular belgian strong fresh, just 6 months ago. Back then it was just average. Now its a masterpiece truly worthy of its hype. Its amazingly complex, and it sure beats all the belgian strongs, lambics and sours that has a rating below 4 here on ratebeer imo. Just dont have it fresh. Its really not the same beer. I hope that explains the low rating its gotten.","SWEDEN","LanceUppercut"

2330,"2009-11-16",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2010 33cl Bottle. Poured a murky amber with a large beige head that lasts some time. Very complex aroma and taste: raisin, sour apple, grapes, De Dolle yeast, sweet malts and booze stand out. The carbonation was very strong at first but mellowed near the end of my glass... and the flavors seemed to blend better too. Close to a medium body, great depth, complex, balanced like a de Kooning painting. Overall excellent - one of the great beers in my book, very unique/original.
Note: Recently had a bottle of this that was about a year old: carbonation had mellowed to a ""medium"", more sour & tart, more blended, alcohol now almost hidden... outstanding now. I have several more of these bottles to age... plan on opening one every 5 years.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","Gustav1996"

2330,"2009-11-11",4.0,"33cl Bottle, purchased at Spiritus Fermenti - Providence, RI. Intense, rich boozy apple aroma paired with juicy caramelized malt sugars and the signature De Dolle yeasts. Absolutely delicate and perfumed. Brilliant. Pours a murky rusty red-brown, with a tall finger of browned pear flesh foam. Flavor is quick and explosive. Volatile blasts of brown bread, apple brandy and hard sauce move around the palate. The high level of carbonation brings minerals and base malt to the back of the palate. Peppery and reminiscent of booze-soaked fruit cake in the sinuses. Delicious and well-done.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Its a bit too syrupy and the carbonation is jacked up a bit too much. The first De Dolle beer Ive had that was a bit disappointing.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

warning!!! this beer is explosive. probably the most gushing belgian i ever opened, even though i was sort of prepared i got beer all over the place (some in the glass). creates giant growing head, making it impossible to just pour it to stop the bottle spewing beer.  i ended up with 15 out of 33 cls in my glass, the rest on the desk, on my trousers, on my shirt, out the window and a little in my keyboard. this yields a 1:1 in apperance, i prefer beers that doesnt explode when opened.

Sampling Notes:
Served chilled in chalice.
Bit of a gush but well saved. Pours a milk chocolate brown body with a tight 2-inch tan head that hangs around very leisurely.
Aroma has a good richness about it; dark chocolate fused with prunes, dates, figs and raisins, dark brown sugar, liquorice, vinous berries with slight woodiness, bit of yoghurty funk business but very appealing overall.
Rich bodied, excellent length, fluffy carbonation lending to an almost milk-shake-like texture. Bit of dryness aluding to the alcohol, but not much indication otherwise.
Deeply complex and rich body; figs, prunes, plenty of dried fruit upfront, sweet nutty malt, dark chocolate, brown sugar, woody spice, definately a journey beer. Finish brings out some dryness, finish very much like a dry red-wine, tannic, quite bitter, an aire of alcohol leaving me wanting to sip again to indulge to palate once again...

When swallowing a mouthful to the middle of the tongue and from there to the sides, the taste is fuller.

It cannot be drunk very matered with the valued durability of two year which it gets advised by the brewery.

De Dolle has a great yeast- gives a mild tartness in the beginning and sours more as it ages giving it the character of a different beer as the sweeter fruits wane (or maybe their brightness remains but the sugar is not as prevalent) and acids take over.  Both the older and the fresher are wonderfully complex and dance on the tongue.  Having trouble finding this lately and it is quite upsetting!  One of my all-time favorites.

Like the Arabier, the Oerbier swells like a defensive toad right after the bottle cap comes off, touching the whole interior of the glass with a smooth, soft, light brown espresso colored head.  So, Im forced to wait, and wait, and wait until I can get a little aroma through the 1.5 thick armor layer of bubbles.  So I skip straight to a sip.  The flavor is moderately dry, and rich with flavors of wood, red grape, peppercorns, well cooked steak, the dry red wine quality of an inexpensive merlot, and, in general, incredibly tasty.  The aftertaste is just as impressive, leaving a trembling echo in my throat, like I just had a spoonful of a fancy red wine and peppercorn steak sauce.  Im in love!  And before I realize it, the foam has agitated itself into oblivion, letting fly the aroma - a gaseous version of the dry red grape flavor.

2330,"2008-09-01",3.7,"33cl bottle. Pours a dark, hazy brown with faint amber/orange highlights and a very thick, very fluffy, tan head that fades eventually into a thin, persistent disk of pocked, swirly tan. The aroma is thick with malt and yeast character - very characteristic De Dolle yeast flavors. The aroma has some complexity in there - mustiness, hints of herbal hops, sticky and thick caramel, toasty melanoidins, and a faint and interesting note of acid/sour. The flavor starts sweet and bready with lots and lots of sweet malts. It also features a brief faint of acid as in the nose - just enough to cut the sweetness without actually tasting acidic or sour. At mid-palate there are some faint notes of spices, some dark candi syrup, and subtle licorice. The bite of carbon dioxide slightly augments the perceived acidity. Dark caramel (hints of chocolate) seem to persist throughout all over the palate. There are subtle notes of earthy hops and subtle spice in there, too (and is that rye I taste? perhaps). The finish is full, sweet, and warming. It finishes with the same house character as in the aroma and tip of the tongue. The mouthfeel is full and very generously carbonated. The body is full enough to stand up to the thick carbonation without it feeling spritzy or over-carbonated. Overall, a very tasty beer that is quite full flavored and has some interesting character. I don’t think it’s quite as strong as some other De Dolle brews, but good nevertheless.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Not much lace.  The aroma of the beer was typical for a dark Belgian and was made up of ripened dark fruit, candi sugar, some doughy yeast, and just a touch of alcohol.  The flavor consisted of dates, raisins, red apples, mild caramel, candi sugar, and some tongue warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with moderately aggressive carbonation.

My first sips of this at cellar temperature were not pleasant. From reading the reviews, I know that the tart, somewhat sour flavor is normal. I just dont care for it. I could actually say that I like this as it nears room temperature. The sourness is gone, although it is still tart. The flavor is refreshing, and complex. I can taste the Belgian yeast, maybe some sour apples, biscuity malt, and grassy hops. 

The mouthfeel is thick without being syrupy in the slightest. The drinkability is low, not because I dont like this, but the flavors would become cloying. I could probably have another one, though. IMO, pop this at cellar temperature just to taste it in that state. As for me, the next time I will start drinking this one at a warmer temperature. This has quite the finish.

A bit fizzy, but that might just be the acidity.  Still viscous.  Much tarter than Id have expected!  Still sweet and a bit cookie doughy.  The caramel is subdued compared to the apple and vinous aspects of the fruit.  What a reversal.  A bit tart, but still creamy.  The toast and woody fruit lingers in a long rather dry finish.

Deep caramel brown, a big tan cap of foam that settles into a dense, frosting-like layer that lasts the whole hour I took sipping through the glass. Initial sniff is a jangle of hot grass and sticky tropical flowers on wet decaying wood. Settles down a notch, and there is raw chocolate, the toasted sugar of creme brulee, with a high-frequency buzz that seems sometimes like vanilla, sometimes like alcohol, and if I hold the glass just right, Big Red® cinnamon gum.

As I slowly open this beer I stop. I can see its going to be a gusher. I let some of the excess carbonation free before fully opening it. Oerbier poured with a dark cola looking body. Ruby highlights when held to the light. Strong bursts of carbonation rise through the highlights. Beige head formed on the pour that quickly faded to a ring around the glass.

Unique aromas coming from the depths of this brew. Dark sticky aromas. Rum soaked raisins, figs, dates and brown sugar. Toasted maltiness along with a moderate alcohol spiciness.

Toasted maltiness starts things off. This beer gets much better as it warms. Actually tastes like candi sugar was added to raise the alcohol. Same flavors as in the aroma but melded together to the point where its difficult to pick one from the next. Actually finishes with a mild leafy hop bitterness.

High carbonation makes this beer super airy and creamy when it hits the palate. Body is on the lighter side of medium.

This is a solidly drinkable beer. One bottle is good for now but thats mostly because of the style. Very enjoyable.

Another solid brew from De Dolle. Very unique and interesting. I cant recall too many BSDAs using candi sugar but maybe I wasnt paying close enough attention.

2330,"2007-05-19",3.5,"I may have to go against the grain on this one.  Pours with an overcarbonated head which makes me a bit leary (oh damn, did I get a bad one?).  All my patience is eventually shown an unusual mix of aromas.  Unpleasant cidery aromas mixed with light golding hops and strong pinot noir presence.  Dont quite know what to make of this even having read what I should expect.  Nice ruby look to the beer, but the first sip leaves me confused.  Typical old-world Belgian strong, but with accents of slight acidity and tannins most likely from the wood aging.  High carbonation, a bit too much so, but on par with the style.   Soon after, a slightly sour character mixed with red wine and just a hint of the specialty malts used.  However, the red wine flavour overpowers all and leaves this ale unbalanced and flawed in my opinion.  My overall impression is that the bottle I had was mostly to the brewers intent.  However, as the recipe is concerned could be better formulated by toning down on the strong wine character and allowing the delicate nature of the malts and hops do most of the talking.  An artisan beer from and artisan brewery, but certainly not their best offering.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

Massive, massive fizzy head, actually so energetic that it was tough to control the poor.  Dark amber / chocolate in colour. Sour, salty nose, not unlike a recently consumed Rodenbach Classic. Not at all unpleasant but not typical of the genre. Not disimilar to taste although the textbook comes more into play as the flavours are quite clearly underpinned with a heavy candied and dirty malt component. The salt (& olive) flavours drive a long finish.  ABV heat kicks in late and makes a lasting impression.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

The beer is very active and I can smell it even though its sitting on the desk 2 feet away.  The aroma is like sour apples and is very malty.  Notes of prunes also come forth.  Some mineral water too.  The flavor is sharp.  The palate really hits first with an extreme effervescence.  The beer essentially tastes like whiskey, sherry, light nougat, and yellow apples.

The flavor was dark caramel, molasses, and deep dark fruits, raisins and prunes, with a cinnamon spice. Also present was a Belgian yeast spice and a nice earthy presence. The malt flavors were well balanced by bittering which was not at all overdone. The body was medium with a high carbonation which led to a creaminess in the mouthfeel.

Sharp aroma of old, soured apple juice and red wine. The sour, fruity flavor includes some corked wine and develops dryness as it develops. Soda-pop mouthfeel. Finish is a nice balance of hops and alcohol, which are both hiding until then. Hooray for De Dolle.... RE-RATED after many repeat drinkings and months of making sure there were always some in the cellar. The sour cherries, those vinous notes, that perfect dusting of bitterness...

Based on the 5 seconds between opening this bottle and starting to pour, I concluded this was an oud brune, which might have some crossover into this ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"" style.  It smelled of sourness as soon as I opened it, and was very carbonated during its pour.  Color was a hazy red-brown.  Taste was very sour and musty...almost like a balsamic vinegar.  Mouthfeel was thin, but not in a watery way...more astringent, like gargling with hydrogen peroxide (in a good way!).

Nose is faint and dark for a Belgian, toffee, faint coffee, bread crust, plum, maybe some caramelized cherries once it warms, and yeast.  Flavor is similar; caramel, light coffee, bread crust, plum, and some acidity with a moderately light bitterness.  Hard to really pick out the flavors being such an unfamiliar specialty Belgian.  Palate is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and a round vinous texture with mild warmth from alcohol.  Finishes with bread crust, some dark berries (cranberries, blackberries maybe), and maybe tobacco.  As I finish this one, I am speechless; not at all what I was expecting from a strong Belgian.

Pours a very hazy dark brown with red highlights. The head is two fingers tall, even with a gentle pour, that settles very slowly to a thick cap, leaving behind a thick, chunky lacing behind. The retention is incredible on this one, as the foamy cap never really fades (even a half hour later).

Smell; a bit chalky on the initial sniffs, then turning to a nice fruity bouquet. Theres plums and dates at first, then it shifts to a bit of cherries and surprisingly apples. The malts are very present, with caramel and toffee at first, followed by candied sugar.

Taste; the fruitiness is prevelant with prunes and plums up front, fading to the cherries. Theres a very strong raw, woody earthiness to the flavor, with a little bit of anise thrown in. In the finish theres a bit of herbal spiciness present, to offset the sweet fruits with an alcohol bite in the finish.

Mouthfeel/Drinkability; the mouthfeel on this one is full bodied, and very creamy, with a bit of bite from the carbonation. Drinkability is really good , but the alcohol bite, and content make this one a sipper for sure.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

Smells of malty brown bread crusts, oak matured wine and leather. In essence it smells old.
I think its the yeast that makes this beer so special - theres a flash of the familiar Quad yeast character there, but its overlaid with a funky sourness that sets this beer apart from any other BSA Ive tried to date. This sourness is delivered with minimal carobonation, producing a flat mouthfeel that again reminds me of drinking old (slightly spoiled) wine. Some blackcurrent winegum sweetness upfront and a mild alcohol burn in the finish behind some mild hop bitterness.

There was also a nice earthy tanned leather component faintly lurking in the background.  The body was medium-full with lively carbonation and a tart, dry texture.

The aromas arent ungodly huge, but they are great and nothing bad to say thus far.  Flavor is tart--unlike the aroma--with some light smoke and acidity showing up.  There is some sour cherries, chocolate, brown sugar, raisins, light alcohol, flavored pipe tobacco (some fruity flavor), and some spice.  After the finish my mouth tastes earthy with some chocolate.

Flavor is much the same with some grapes and then roasty coffee malts in the dry finish.  There is some warming of ETOH in the back of the throat--complementing the beer rather than distracting.

2330,"2006-08-11",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2006 Not that De Dolles Oerbier doesnt deserve a praiseful preamble, but being a rather complicated beer in itself, a conversely simple review reflects the simple nature of its excellence. That said, Oerbier begins with an exciting and dynamic pour, the rich brown liquid flickers of chestnut red highlights and its massive bisque-colored head puffs up such that the assemblage resembles a billowing marshmallow over the fire. The aroma is a magical blend of sweet fruits, spices, flowery and malty tones tickling the nose down to the tastebuds. Cherries, prunes, apple, hazelnut and banana flow into scents of vanilla, cinnamon and cardamom laced with a soapy lavender and rose mixture which itself brings forth the deep coffee, brown sugar, Burgundy and chocolate background. The complexity is astounding. Coffee and dark chocolate are at first apparent on the tongue, but estery bubble gum follows and liberates a flood of flavors ranging across the bitter, sour and sweet, all at once. Explosive. Brown sugar reverberates the buttery malts while ginger, clove and coriander entertain the almond and alcohol notes themselves ambuscaded by orange syrup. My tongue performs contortionistic tricks and my brain no less, trying to process the onslaught; but as the long dry finish unfolds sequential flavors of coffee beans softening to cherries and finally coconut, all I can think is ""Wow"". This brew is full of surprises, especially in its distinct sourness that seems so suddenly appropriate. As it warms the particularly present spices attenuate to form a progressively smoother palate. As I said, beyond complicated, this is a very simply excellent beer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Almost a red wine like aroma.  Also a little sourness.  Almost berries, cherries, and plums.  Flavor - Sharp carbonation up front.  A little sour and kind of watery on the tongue.  After the swallow is very complex - some sour, citrus (orange), alcohol warmth and flavor, some wine-like tartness, and a really dry finish.  Palate - high level of carb.

The nose is of prunes and effervescent malts.  An upfront tartness edges linearly into semi-sweet/dark chocolates in the mid-palate, with tart citrusy esters and alcohol warmth (re)introduced in the close.  Warming the palate is a tart sweet n sour finish.  This is a wonderful brew, very complex and well-balanced.  There is a mixture of Granny Smith apples, fresh cherries, early picked grapes, and vinous notes all throughout the pull, balanced with a dry-roasted effervescence.

Caramel and toasty malt hit me as I pour.  Im somewhat surprised by the chestnut fluid and pillowy tan head as I was expecting another Belgian blonde.  The head flattens, stabilises, and takes on a rocky crystal appearance under the Champagne-like effervescence.  Once I get a chance to nose it properly it is all phenolics - plastic, cinnamon - and wood.  Bone dry in the mouth, with toasty scotch-like malts, a sourness in the middle and a barrel load of phenolics in th finish.  Wood and astringent candy linger, followed by strong herbal notes of liquorice and mint.  Light but definitely not watery, and it improves significantly the more it warms and airs.  Slight yeast residue on the palate, though most remained in the bottle.  Quite different but the phenolics put me off a little.

There is an obvious skew of malt in this and its quite rich and sweet, though not particularly complex. some bitter chocolate flavours in the middle leading into a mild fruit finish. pretty good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"

2330,"2005-11-18",4.3,"Beeryum! The original and still the best. My favourite Scotch ale, brewed by none other than the mad brewers of Esen. Pure class!!! Tasted an older sample from the bottle (unsure of age), and poured it into a stumpy chalice glass, cool and not cold. It has the colour and clarity of pulped strawberries; opaque, with a lot of floaties caught in suspension. Deep burgundy-chestnut body with a smallish, tight, creamy beige head that lasted and left webs of lace. Rich, spicy fruit cake nose. Strong prune, fig and raisin notes with hints of bready, doughy yeast, orange rinds and exotic peppery herbs. Intensely spicy, rich and savoury on the tongue. Tingling alcohol warms the cockles while the malty smooth body fills all the crevices of the mouth. Full bodied and lightly prickly in carbonation; it showed extensions of the aroma with strong notes of Nanas famous christmas fruit pudding soaked in her favourite cognac, this was explosive. Dried plums and red grapes, clove-like spices and a mildly bitter, malty and herbal hop back that followed into a long, savoury dried fruit and doughy malt swallow. Beautifully balanced and exquisitely made, this is a genuine winter warmer that is credit to the masters at De Dolle. Lovely!!! (33cL, age unknown)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Anyway the beer itself. Aroma is fresh with dark fruits blending well with the hops. Taste is similar with a nice sourness, light tartness makes this an exciting and refreshing brew. Also the pour itself is something special, ouitstanding dark appearance makes this a serious highlight of the trip and has made me think that i need more sour tart beers.

Swift cotton floss and subtle vanilla towards the ends. The finish is marvelous...lingers...lingers...lingers. Powerful beer.

2330,"2005-10-06",3.2,"This was interesting.  Not so much in flavor (which was enjoyable) but in the palate (which was quite odd).  Poured a dark roasty brown with a bubbly head.  Smelled a little like sour cherries and port.  Taste was spot-on with a nice balance of sweet and sour, some spice like black peppers and orange peels studded with cloves.  But the palate is what really threw me for a loop: this was extra-ordinarily fizzy.  I likened it to a candy I used to have called Zotz!  Maybe somebody else reading this has had one.  Basically, a Zot! was a rather generic fruit-flavored candy filled with a bicarbonate concoction that would literally fizz in your mouth.  This brew did the same thing.  As soon as it met the palate it exploded in a flurry of fizziness.  I was a little taken aback by this and learned to cope with it to enjoy an otherwise enjoyable experience.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Fantomas23"
2330,"2005-10-04",3.6,"330 ml bottle.  Pours a murky brown with a rather large white fluffy head.  Very high level of carbonation in the glass, a virtual cascade of bubbles arising from the bottom of my chalice.  Aroma of banana, citrus, sweet malt, yeast, and earthyness.  Flavor is a little tart up front, suggestive of sour cherries, then settles into a malty middle, then a yeasty and dry finish.   Overall this beer is rather complex, but in a very general sort of way, nothing really stands out as an exceptional characteristic.   Alcohol makes itself know in the finish as well.  Mouthfeel is a little fizzy, and not really to my personal preference.  It is pretty light bodied as well which surprised me as the comm. description goes on at length about the malt bill.

Very smooth and silky mouthfeel, pretty much what youd expect from De Dolle, although it was much smoother than the Reserva.  Rather sweet mouthfeel when cool with raisin, caramel, chocolate, cherry and other dark fruits.  As it warms, it becomes more and more like bakers chocolate.  It also becomes more tart as it warms.

2330,"2005-05-11",3.9,"33cl bottle. Served at 55°F (~13°C) in my NB worthy glass. I saved the sediment in the bottle, for now.  It is a foamer. A huge white head was created while pouring the beer into the  glass. The rocky head is slow to die down. The aroma is sour, yeasty, raisiny, with a touch of brown sugar. The beer is huge, malty and bubbly, with a rush of alcohol. The flavors are dark fruit, plums and raisins, some spice and alcohol. It, indeed, is a Belgian Strong Ale. The aftertaste is dark fruits after the alcohol leaves. I added the sediment to the glass and the beer now sports a slew of suspended yeast particles (and Im sure some other stuff) and a lighter, citrusy aroma to go with the sour, yeasty, and and slighty sweet nose. The flavor seems a tad bit spicer and sour, but that alcohol is still there to clean the palate. It might be a little too ""hot"" and Im pretty sure this has more than 7.5%, Id say those little yeast have been working overtime on this one.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Beer poured a plummy amber colour with a towering tan head that stayed and stayed. Complex fruity aroma includes figs, sherbet, dried fruit and a hint of underlying molasses. Its the kind of aroma you can sniff for ages and find something new (which gives you something to do while the head subsides at a glacial pace, lacing beautifully). Mouthfeel is full and creamy. In fact, its almost treacle-like, but for the restrained carbonation. Molasses is one of the dominant flavours, which also include dried fruit, dark malt and a dash of soy sauce. Its highly malt-driven, with the warming alcohol in the finish nicely restrained. This is wonderfully balanced. A new entry in my Top Ten.

2330,"2004-10-07",4.2,"An explosive head that is a very light brown. The murky brown colour was very appealing. I wasnt able to dectect a very complex aroma, it was kind of like apple cider. It felt pretty medium bodied with an excellent flavour. It was a little bit spicy, with the apple cider coming back from the aroma. It finised smooth and I wasnt able to detect any alcohol. An overall terrific beer.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

Golden.

Pale to rich malts provide a buttery and caramel maltiness but a more elaborate ripe fruitiness is more prominent, providing notes of plum, banana and clove.

2330,"2004-09-27",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2005 Brown-red colour with a great big grey coloured head. Looks awesome. Very appley, cidery aroma (good cider, not like dodgy home brew) - I really couldnt get over how appley it really was. Some cinnamon, pepper, oak and vinousness. Reminded me of both Orval and Abbaye des Rocs. Very spicy (allspice) and again appley, apple core flavour. Quite hot and rather headache-inducing. Some sultana and port flavours with some bitterness at the end. The harsh alcoholic flavour really detracts from what would otherwise be a great beer. I wish Id gotten another bottle to cellar! Courtesy of beer_ledgend. Re-rate: I really love De Dolle but I just cant get into their flagship product. The ""old"" (ie. the just replaced) version tastes a little dull and sweet, and the ""new"" (ie. soured again) version is far too sweet and the sourness has to fight to just give it a bit of balance. Its probably not a widely held view but Id rather drink any of their products over this one. Down the ladder.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Aroma is somewhat dry, hints of nuts, caramel, soft and slightly sweet, with huge spiciness, and a touch of woodiness. A welcome phalanx of hops jumps on board the buds, followed by an armada of sweet malt. Warm and highly charged, with a softly diminishing finish. 
Bracing, bold, and delicious! My guess on the style would be either a high-alcohol brown ale, or maybe a souped-up Scotch, either way, several notches above what Id expect. At 7.7%, Im starting to feel it, too! Wonderful, chewy texture, full body, altogether excellent!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

Nice malty aroma, with caramel, some fruit and a bit of tartness.  Color is a hazy dark ruddy brown.  Very lively in the mouth.  This is what all belgian strong ales should taste like.  Malty, warming from the alcohol, slightly tart, bit of caramel and toffee.  Bit of port wine and a hint of spices.  Wonderful blending of sweetness and tartnesss.  Dry and a little puckering at the finish and warming as it goes down.  A top quality belgian strong but I can see how some people may not like this style.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

Same goes for the sweet flavour as the aroma. A hint of milky coffee along with fruits, nuts and chocolate.

Re-rate from 06 of a 83 vintage: Wont replace the earlier one as 23 year old Oerbiers probably arent something easily gotten hold off.

Anyway, this was one of the best beers I have ever had. Reminded me strongly of Rodenbach Grand Cru (a big favourite) as it had gotten noticably more vinous and acidy. On the finish there were big hints of cherries. Fabulous!

The aroma is really top notch, but the alochol is too eveident for a beer of this gravity.  The finish is just less than it could be.  In the areas of polish, we have a slight failure...in the important areas of appearance and taste...we have a winner.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
2330,"2004-08-21",3.8,"You gotta give De Dolle credit for making some unique beers. I dont really feel like getting into it but you gotta give em credit. Their beers are unique... and tasty. Oerbier is brown in appearance. I could describe it in terms of various stained hardwoods but I dont really feel like getting into it. The point is: its brown and it has a very quickly diminishing head. I could compare the rate of its deminishment to that of very fast supercars and hovercrafts but I dont feel like getting into it. The point is: the head is small and it goes away fast like a racecar or a hovercraft and, honestly, Im kinda growing to miss it a little bit. Ive always been a fan of head (huh huh huh...a fan of head... get it!) and when I dont see it on a beer, especially a beer of such high quality, it disappoints me. About that quality: I could compare the subtle complexity and interplay between dark cherry, raisin and  molasses flavors being balanced by a mild but very noticeable tartness and alcohol  to that of a fine wine but I really dont feel like getting into it. You see, I dont like wine as much as beer so that would be discrediting this fine brew in my book. But you know what? I dont feel like getting into that either. The point is: Oerbier is unique, complex, lightly tart and brown. So there...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

As the pour had indicated, there's plenty of yeast in there, but also a profound malt depth of apples, lactic cherry yogurt, blood oranges and a sweetness closing to milk chocolate. Appealing complexity already, but further sniffs have even more to offer with hints of earth, oak and saw dust. Medium bodied and sparkling, initially cherry/apple sweet, but balanced by more sourness than expected. Aftertaste can't hide the age of the sample, a little off-flavour of something alike cement or dirty grass distracts a bit from the enjoyment.

Its slower than slow to settle, if ya can call it that, it takes an awful long time to move, but once it stops it stops at just under a finger high and maintains a murky frappacchino crown the whole glass down. The lacing sticks all over the place in thick patchy curtains; the pinnacle of a great looking beer!

Aroma has a considerately yeast filled, softly spiced top with an underlying dulled dark citrus and tropical fruitiness with some banana, pear, and a bit of lemon. Alcohol presents itself at first as well but seems to dissapate as it warms where the yeasty spicyness really becomes dominate bringing out some gingerbread and corriander.

Fantastic structure of fairly strong and pleasant flavors with a super fine showmanship of soft, well rounded fruitiness up front bringing a small brigade of banana, lemon, red apple, and fig. Fairly smooth with a stable maltyness and calming fuzzy full roundness in the front. In the middle some soft caramel sneaks around the corners as it begins to fade off towards the finish the spices and yeast kick in with a bit of singe on the back of the throat and some hop bite adds some dryness floating off late with wood and spice. I really liked the way it starts soft and fruity and takes its time to build into the spicy finish, very nice.

Feel has a good fuzzy/fluffy carbonation and texture that comes across the whole way through. Has a bit of crispness and dryness in parts just before the finish, but mostly the malts surge in a gradual smoothness as it goes down with yeasty spices grabbing around the edges; considerably exquisite drinkability with this first-rate ale.

Very active with huge, uniform, frothy head that lingers.  Amazing amount of carbonation still boiling up from the bottom of the glass.  Nose is of sour and tart cherry, vinous and acidic.  Very estery.  A little bit vinegary.  Some mellowing sweetness and ""roundness"" to the scent.  Powerful, robust flavor, more malty with glowing (almost burning) but somehow sweet acidity.  Yeast also.  Vinous and lightly fruity on the front, but the malts control this thing.  Unbelievable long finish but a little overwhelming in its power.  Still leaving a nice hum and ring on the tongue many minutes after drinking.  Slightly oily texture on a thin body.  A ton of sediment sits in the bottom of the bottle, and when poured into the glass it naturally darkens the brew and muddies it up a bit (the irregular but large particles are all over the glass), but I really like the additional depth, dirtiness, and bitterness to the flavor.

Flavor was a rich medley of dark fruit, caramels and red wine, all of which formed a unique, very sweet beer.  Lively mouthfeel due to strong carbonation.

Pours a hazy amber-copper color, with a tan head that is made up of largish bubbles.  The first aroma I get is of some funky farm-house cheese.  This is followed by a sweet brandy-like fruitiness (plum perhaps), and some notes of alcohol.  The taste is sweet up front, but is followed immediately by a prickling carbonation that boils the beer on my tongue.  Quite fruity tasting with notes of plum, fig, and raisin.  A touch of acidity, though not nearly as much as in some of their examples of this beer.  There is a definite alcoholic kick in the finish.  There is a nice twang in the finish that gives this beer an appetizing character.  Some musty-earthy notes are detectable up front, and somehow this beer is quite austere/ vinous in character.  Overall this is quite good but I must say that I enjoy getting the bottles that have a bit more acidity in them.

Sampled March 2001, Belgium
Has a sharp fruity aroma.  It tastes nicely sweet with a caramel slightly bitter finish.  This is quite good, with a perfect amount of sourness & complexity.

Some warm peachy/orange alcohol notes and a bit of yeast.  Flavor opened up a little bit held back but then as it sat in my mouth it grew sweeter and maltier.  After trying Dulle Teve, this beer is not as flavorful, but also a nice comprimise with the abv.  Had alot of citrus notes blended with caramel malt which created a unique taste.  The flavor dried out heavily towards the finish.  Id say the dominant flavor in the medium-full body was raisin.  Tasted like raisins soaked in alcohol.

1983 vintage .. First of all, Im not jumping aboard some band wagon just because this is a vintage bottle and almost as old as myself, I didnt expect anything from this, and had no idea how it was stored during those 25 years. I did expect this to be a fun experience but I thought that it was certain that the bottle was bad or oxidiced. Boy was I wrong, poured this into a burgundy glass, and to my surprise it was still carbonated. Very delicate and small bubbles and a thin but firm tiny white head. Very dark, but not jet black. Ruby black would describe the color. Massive aroma of cherries when poured, some malts and tiny hints of spices. When it heated up the raisins shone through and  created a perfect balance, both in the aroma and the palate.

The flavor starts malty and a little spicy, but is very well balanced.  Plum fruit flavors and alcohol also appear and finishes on the dry side.  Aftertaste is malt and spice and very pleasant.  Higher carbonation probably lends to lighter than actual mouthfeel which is fairly light compared to alcohol content which is warming.

2330,"2002-07-06",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Red wine and cherry fruitiness meets wood, coniferous brettanomyces and berry jam in this super effervescent Belgian-style Strong Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sizeable head of foam covers the dark, reddish brown .
-Carbonation is overdone, rendering the mouthfeel rather explosive as soon as it hits the palate.
-Body is otherwise rather dry.
-The finish is barely acidic; this is more wild than tart.
-While this is enjoyable, it is also overrated to me. Too rough and unrefined on many fronts.

A friend of me buys every year two palets.  One to drink, the other to stay in his cellar.  Because it seems that this beer becomes better with the years.  Imagine, it is already a very good one!","BELGIUM","confusedboy0"

2330,"2001-02-25",4.7,"Like Trois Pistoles, this beer is a mix between a Flanders red and an Abbey Dubbel; also like Trois Pistoles, it is a phenomenal beer.  It is both full-bodied and sharply sour, giving it a huge complexity as well as great drinkability. Another great beer from De Dolle.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"

2330,"2001-02-19",4.6,"cloudy amber colour, fine lace, complex aroma: cherry, apple, slightly smoked; sweet flavor, great complex aftertaste (with a hint of cherry) - a monument !","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
2330,"2001-02-08",4.3,"Rich with a full malt palate and puckering
sourness that I find rather pleasant.
The sourness is very remiscient of sour cherries, 
and as Oakes mentioned, warrants comparison to a 
kriek lambic.  Cloudy dark brown color, as appropriate, 
with excellent creamy head and complete head retention.
High carbonation helps cut the sweet/sour flavors
and the beer on the whole is exceptionally drinkable.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
2330,"2001-01-15",4.3,"Rich dark ale that can become quite lean and acidic with age, developing flavours remeniscent of Liefmans Kriek.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
