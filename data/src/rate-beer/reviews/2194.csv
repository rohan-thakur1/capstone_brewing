2194,"2016-10-23",3.7,"Bottle from a 4 pack purchased from Binnys Naperville (Naperville, IL). A fun new Oktoberfest to give a go. Pours a nice deeper brownish carmelized color, a gentle haziness, deeper colors and auburn glow striking the edges and bottom. Frothy offwhite head atop dies down to a decent ringer, laces ok overall. Aromas are dry, a bit toasty, earthy floral hops and a bit of carmelized and biscuity appeal. Initial is lighter bodied with just a bit of girth. Carmelized malts, dry and bready malts, some toasty appeal and earthy hop appeal. Dry, light, very crushable with a nice toasty appeal, firm bitterness and cleaner backend taper out. One of my favorite Okts of the new season.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2194,"2015-11-03",3.8,"Received in trade from gregwilsonstl, thanks for the opportunity!
Mostly clear deep golden color with a huge frothy off white head that shows great retention. Hints of sulfur and mercaptin when first poured, but those subsided. Sweet bready pils with just a touch too much in fruity esters on the nose with a light floral hop. Bready sweet pilsner maltiness with an almost cereal or oat quality to it, really digging the malt profile on the this brew. Light bitterness with a spicy hop flavor that is also light. Definitely one of the better stateside O-fest brews that Ive tried!","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
2194,"2015-10-03",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2015 I retried this one blind and got about the same score but it didnt really make the same impression on me. This is so estery we thought it might be a Oktoberfest Weizen beer we slipped into the tasting for fun. Its good but that kind of spicy/fruity yeast character is not the kind of thing a lager beer is supposed to have. It still tastes good, Im just saying. What really makes it is a creamy, full-body texture w/o being too sweet. I drank a bunch of this stuff over the fall and Im kind of embarrassed I could not pick it out but, hey, at least I agree w/ myself that its good. 

Original rating: This is a solid Oktoberfest and I am glad to have the rest of the four pack to drink after this one--which is not the kind of thing I say about most American Oktoberfests. This has kind of a bready yeast character to the nose, along w/ some nutty malt and maybe a touch of floral hops--maybe. This is just a touch sweet w/ a nice full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel. It finishes w/ mild bitterness and lingering raisin sweetness. This is a well done beer all in all.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Pours deep copper hue with a soapy eggshell head with sparse lacing. very nice looking hue to this one. Nose of marzen malt (toasted bread, slightly husky, chex mix,) earthy, lightly spicy with mild hops. Flavors are great-lots of the marzen malt coming through, amber grain husks, nice earthy notes. This is just a tad behind the Sierra Nevada from this year in terms of greatness. Long finish full of lager yeast twang, amber grain husks, Slightly spicy hop presence lingering long into the finish. This is fantastic stuff!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

2194,"2015-09-09",3.7,"500ml bottle. Like the berghoff I had before this thankfully a lighter Amero-Oktoberfest rendition. This one has a wild yeast character in the aroma (no not wild but unbridled), Big fruitiness with an underlying of herbs, toast, and sugar cookie. It is nicely caramelly ad fruity with just enough maltiness finishing dry. A lto fruitier than most but closer to the festbier type of style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

The palate is medium bodied, active carbonation and a slightly cloying honey sweet mineral finish.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

The nose was butternut, caramel, minerals, and a mild hop presence. The flavor profile yielded a moderate mouthfeel, caramel and a traditional grain presence, but the center is lacking in character and flavor really - it finishes with mild hop flowers and some more grain presence, with a lingering sweetness near the finish.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Pours a hazy orange color with a medium off-white head. The aroma is unusual for a marzen and gives off a little bit of old cheese along with biscuity malts, butter, white bread, crackers, and apricot.
