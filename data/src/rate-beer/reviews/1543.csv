1543,"2017-03-11",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2017 Richtig gelungenes Wheat Ale. Das kÃ¶nnen sie, hat ja schon das American Wheat bewiesen. Leuchtend weizengetrÃ¼bt und mit GrÃ¼nstich im heugelb. Klasse, denn auch der Duft lÃ¤ÃŸt sich nicht lumpen. Floral, limettig, frischholzig und spicey. Rosmarie & grÃ¼ne Paprika. Pfeffer & Koriander. Nice. Der Trunk ist hellmalzig, kurz angesweetet und dann deutlich hopfendry. Fresh & wie ein Softball auf den Gaumen. ðŸ˜Ž. MHD01/17. Trotzdem noch supi.

1543,"2016-09-02",3.7,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, wheat, tropical fruit and hops.

Appearance:

Turbid yellow beer with heavy yeast and with a slight/medium white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, wheat and tropical fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. The hops are definitely most dominant, pushing the wheat away. A really refreshing hoppy wheat ale.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Smaak: Citrus/Grapefruit maar dan in een zoetere vorm, erg fris. Bitterzoet zou ik zeggen. Fruitige en een tik kruidigheid waardoor er toch ook scherp randje aan zit. In de afdronk een goede hop nabitter die fruitig en kruidig is. Redelijk volle body weinig koolzuur, makkellijk drinkbaar in het zonnetje.
