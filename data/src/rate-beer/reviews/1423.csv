1423,"2011-08-13",3.2,"This beer has been given some very high scores by many reviewers, too high in my opinion. I often have the impression when reviewing German beers that many of the other reviewers have not drank many examples of the original style. I just reviewed Dieu de Ciel¬ís Czech Lager and was very impressed with how good a version of this style it was. I feel differently about this, rather heavy for an alt beer with a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. If I drank this not knowing it was an alt beer I probably would not identify it as one. Not a bad beer but only moderately resembles an alt. In general a beer should be of the style it is supposed to be. Now I have given some beers that were not exactly the style they stated decent marks if I felt they were something special on their own but that is not my feeling about this beer. Decent beer but nothing special, not very true to the style and below the usually high standard of Dieu du Ciel.","Quebec, CANADA","UM02"

1423,"2011-05-17",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2011 My Bottom Line:
Toasted malts and their caramelized undertow wash up on the tastebuds, leaving a fruity trail and spicy hop bitterness. This is a wonderful North American Altbier that¬ís not trying to be an amped-up version of the original style, for once.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A multi-layered head of foam laces all around the cloudy copper.
-The finish is probably my favorite part of the flavor profile; hop bitterness, toasted malt angles and light residual sugars coalesce beautifully.
-The flavor profile never gets boring. I love when beers pile up flavors with each sip instead of walloping you with all flavors at once. 
-Carbonation is ample and soft; a few bottles of this can disappear rapidly...
-This is not an overly simple and sweet version of the style. All flavors (and aromas) are intricate and harmonious from beginning to end.
-The nose starts off as timid when fresh out of the beer fridge, but reveals plenty of details upon warming up..
-Now if they could serve gravity-style from an oak cask. Just to compare it to D√ºsseldorf¬ís best, of course.
-Man, that 6-pack disappeared quickly...

Flavour is strong and lasting, makes the impression of the liquid stronger than the initial impressoin on the palate. A nutty malt with a building taste through the finish and long aftertaste. A heavy presence on the palate. Nice hop balance gives a bit of pepperiness.

1423,"2011-03-19",3.6,"Pours bronze. Clear. Average white head, decent retention... And huge lace!
My nose was completely blown up -- I couldn¬ít discern any aroma whatsoever. All I could notice was a good hop presence, but that shouldn¬ít come as a surprise, considering it¬ís a... beer. But it¬ís probably hoppy for an Alt. Also, the fact my nose was blown up meant the mouth wasn¬ít so great, either. Nice balance between malt and hops -- ingredients are awesome. Really woody -- like most of the good alts. Finale is bitter, but somehow surprisingly crisp as well (if that makes sense...?). Mouthfeel is somewhere between oily and sticky.
Wouldn¬ít call this one the ""perfect"" alt -- but it has the perfect balance between drinkability and taste. Might revisit this rating.","Gatineau/St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","MXD"

App.:  Clear copper with a nice light tan head.
