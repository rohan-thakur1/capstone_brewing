1619,"2014-03-15",2.9,"Clear very very pale straw color. Subtle aroma with hints of fruit and a very slightly earthy cheesy note. Smooth, full bodied palate. Clean and gentle taste. Overall, an unexceptional, easy drinking sake.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Pyobon"

1619,"2012-07-29",3.4,"It pours clear with the slightest hint of yellow. The aroma has notes of: plums, alcohol, melons, and sweet congi. The taste is medium sweet that finishes quite dry and tart; there are notes of: honey, plums, raisins, rice pudding, and alcohol. The palate is full-bodied, slightly viscous, and medium finish. Overall, a delicious gingo","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
1619,"2011-01-15",3.9,"Serving at Akari in London. Pours clear. Holds a prominent white grape aroma with plenty of plum as well. Nice and smooth flavor. More plum and some subtle vanilla with mild alcohol presence. Light to medium in body. Some pleasant warmth to finish, with more fruits and mild vanilla cream. Very nice, very drinkable.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1619,"2010-06-27",2.7,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a extremely small sized head of frothy clear colored bubbles that were and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body. The aroma was vinous rice wine. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a strong vinous aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of vinous rice wine. A decent one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1619,"2009-02-20",3.4,"At Hiros Yakko-San. Glassy with a slight pale yellow tint. Koji-forward then lychee and rambutan, and only a hint of sulphur. The palate is nice creamy soft viscosity. Flavors have some Asian pear notes. Lingering coconut meat finish and pure polished rice notes.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1619,"2007-08-22",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2007 Hmmm, I thought this stuff was fantastic when I had a glass at Oishii in Boston on 7/13/07Very bold flavor, as others mention, though Im always susceptible to too much/too sharp of an alcohol flavor/aroma and I didnt find it here.  Robust fruitiness abounds, and I guess my preference for thicker-bodied, nuttier, bolder sakes (must be a novice thing) is taking over here.  Light floral/fruitiness on the end shows that its not all heavy/sweet rice.Large legs, looks like a sake....","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1619,"2007-07-28",3.2,"Sampled at Temple in Minneapolis. Light yellow color with rice, fruits and alcohol.  Mild fruit flavors in the body and a definite bite in the finish.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
1619,"2005-04-19",3.0,"Clear with a slight hint of beige and leaves a filminess on the glass. Some koji and a hint of fruitiness with touches of alcohol. Koji again in the flavor with a bit of rice. The body is milky and pretty large. Alcohol isnt hidden in the tail.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
1619,"2005-04-18",3.2,"720mL Bottle: Clear color, oily legs. Nose of light koji and roughly polished rice, some alcohol. The flavor is thick with koji and a big body. Not too subtle with a buttery finish. Very tangy and  acidic. Eh.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1619,"2004-09-11",2.9,"Flat fruit with flabby wallpaper paste flavors. Soft and tasty though not interesting. Also the alcohol did show a bit too much.","Barcelona, SPAIN","obisbeer"
1619,"2004-03-15",3.0,"Supposedly, the Daiginjo version of this Demon Slayer sake is utterly fantastic.  I was less impressed by this Ginjo version, which seemed a tad rough and had alcohol burn in the aftertaste.  I had it at a sake tasting in a store, so there wasn't much time (or liquid) to flesh out this rating, other than to say it had an unusual watermelon-tinged nose, which is odd.  Neutral on dry-sweet spectrum.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
