558,"2009-11-17",4.3,"On tap at 5 Seasons Westside.

Pours a dark, dark murky brown with a big creamy tan head that recedes to a healthy collar and leaves bits of lacing.

The aroma is big and sweet with lots of dark fruits, molasses and cocoa.  The sweetness is balanced well in the nose by the toasted character of the caramel malts.  Some fruity esters coming out as well.

The taste is spectacular.  Its an amped-up version of the nose with the big roasted malts and caramel sweetness of the backbone supporting the sweet fruity esters and healthy dose of chocolate and vanilla.  There are dark fruits as well with sugar-coated raisins and figs coming to mind.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with good carbonation and sticky sweet with a noticeable alcohol burn going down.

This is one of my favorite 5 Seasons beers.  Its extremely complex but very drinkable for the ABV.  Absolutely love this stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
558,"2009-04-11",3.5,"interesting beer.  dark, almost porter like pour.  Slightly off white head.  Lots of caramel and raisins in the aroma.  The flavor is coffee, burnt toast and some fruit.  Slight burn.  Nice....but not what I expect in a dubbel.","Hoon, Georgia, USA","pintocb"
558,"2009-01-22",4.4,"Pours a deep, warm sable with a decent beige head. Rich, malty, smoky aroma has hints of coffee and caramel, and invites a taste. Mouth-filling flavor has tones of coffee, burnt caramel, and quite a strong alcohol nip - not surprising considering it is seriously high-gravity! There are also nutty and hoppy hints. Texture is smooth as silk and rich as cream.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
558,"2008-04-23",3.8,"Backlogged rating from the opening of 5SN (a long time ago) Usually I enter ratings immediately, but I found this one hiding in an unpacked moving box. - Pours completely black. Aroma of chocolate, rum, alcohol, bready malt, caramel, and cherry. Tastes of rum, spice, toffee, chocolate, and estery alefruits. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Very nice, big gravity hidden behind good attenuation.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
