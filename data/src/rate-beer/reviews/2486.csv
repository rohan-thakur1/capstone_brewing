2486,"2017-04-29",3.6,"Beautiful golden color, the smell is yest, wheaty, the taste is very bitter, very hoppy. Not very malty, needs a little more ABV but at good beer.","long beach, California, USA","Mrnoluv"
2486,"2016-10-02",3.8,"Bottle: &nbsp Let me just start by saying that Founders can seemingly do no wrong. &nbsp This is one of those examples where you cross two styles and it works, works well. &nbsp Vibrant straw in color, perhaps a tinge of orange, nice moderate to large foamy off-white head, with nice lacing. &nbsp Sweet bready aroma, light, almost grassy but not quite. &nbsp Smooth on the tongue, well balanced, even a bit chewy. &nbsp Its like the best of both worlds, slightly hoppy but the body of a rich lager. &nbsp Big thanks to pailhead for sending one my way. &nbsp Generally not a big fan of the style, but this one drinks way too easy. &nbsp Its a bit warming too which aint bad at all. &nbsp Great beer!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
2486,"2016-07-21",3.5,"Maybe a touch past its prime. Like a big thick Pilsner, still with some spicy and grassy hops, clean sweet leaning grainy malt. Full body for this style. I like, but didnt love it.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

2486,"2016-06-11",3.6,"Poured from a bomber. Slightly cloudy pale yellow. White foamy head dissipates quickly. Heavy tropical fruit aroma-mango and peach plus some pepper and earth. Hops are fruity and spicy accompanied by moderately sweet malts. Bitterness is spot on - up front and center, but not bitey. Light fizz, smooth body. Nice beer.","Roswell, Georgia, USA","deaconmike"

2486,"2016-01-17",3.1,"Bottle aged for a year in my cellar. Clear, golden body. Frothy white head, rapidly diminishing. Aromas of toasted grain and alcohol. The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. It finishes moderately sweet and moderately bitter, with a lingering bitterness. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Alcoholic from start to finish. Guess I should not have let this sit around too long.","Rochester, New York, USA","Ron"
2486,"2016-01-10",4.3,"Poured into a snifter.

4.0 A: Nearly clear peach color. One and a half fingers of frothy/creamy off-white head. Retention is about average and a healthy ring of lacing is left.

4.75 S: Any hint of a pilsner is gone. This is all about the hops. HUGE citrus aroma with mango then orange leading the way. Pineapple and a touch of lemon follow. Second to the citrus is pine and grapefruit. A touch of earthiness to finish it off. This smells awesome.

4.5 T: Again it just tastes like a DIPA albeit a very clean one. Tastes like it smells. Mild-moderate bitterness. If you concentrate you can almost taste the pilsner underneath.

4.25 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Supremely smooth with just the slightest of bitter finish.

4.5 D: Pick this up. Its freakin good.

2486,"2015-09-28",3.7,"750 ml bottle. Pours a mostly clear and dark golden Amber color and topped by a small layer of off white foam that quickly fades to a thin film and leaves scant lines of lace around the glass. The aroma shows notes of pine, resin, orange peel and grapefruit hops, clean lager yeast and a toasted caramel and toffee malt base. The flavor follows with caramel, toffee, and buttery sweetness up front followed by citrus fruit and a floral and pine like bitterness from hop profile. The lager yeast keeps things clean and from getting overly sweet. Medium to full bodied and slick on the palate with balanced carbonation that leads to a clean, dry and bitter sweet finish with just a touch of heat from alcohol. This is a solid imperial pale lager, but just a little too heavy to really drink a ton of this.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Theres not much head, but you dont need a lot of foam to take in the resinous hop aromas and bread-like malt. The taste could keep me happy all day long. Hops are citrusy and piney. The bread flavors help to smooth things over, but this Lager is undeniably hop-forward. Despite the bitterness, this brew is crisp and refreshing. Plenty of attitude but it tips back easily.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Quickly followed by an alcohol burn, mixed with citrusy hops, and a strong bitterness. Blends together quite well on the finish. Slick mouthfeel but not off-putting. Somewhat peppery bitterness comes through as it warms up, but hard to find the ""pilsner"" flavor overall. Not bad though.","Round Lake, Illinois, USA","sawbuck"
2486,"2015-01-04",3.3,"Pours a hazy, deep yellow color with a very nice, 1/4 inch dense white foamy head. Aroma has a very strong citrus nose at first with a pronounced orange nose, light lemon zest hints with some light pine in the finish. The malt of this beer sits behind the scenes and adds a light grainy presence late in the nose. Flavor starts off with a strong cascade hops orange note which is quickly followed up by light lager and grainy flavor at the end. Body is modest with a low amount of carbonation and a good deal of residual sweetness to hold the hoppy flavor and strong alcohol presence. Overall a good brew but nothing outstanding. I feel the high alcohol presence and large hops presence watered down the beer a bit.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
2486,"2015-01-02",4.1,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a clear golden yellow with thick white head and tons of lacing. Big time hop aroma with citrus notes of lemon peel and some floral notes. Taste is unlike any other lager I've had. Absolutely no alcohol taste so this will really creep up on ya. Easily could pass as an Imperial IPA. Moderate to heavy bitterness with a nice malt backbone. Lot of citrus flavors with some grass and grainy flavors. Just an incredible beer.

The flavour is mildly malty sweet with pale malts, honey, slight fruit and a noble hop bitterness that increases over time. A touch of resin comes through as well. The finish is long and hoppy with a slight spice. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, milky texture and average carbonation. Overall, a decent imperial pils.

A release that sparkles with a combination of hops and malt, this release caught my eye as I was checking out. I am not entirely sure what to make of this new trend of IPLs but if many of them maintain this level of quality I look forward to more breweries giving this a shot.

Aroma / Appearance - A caramelly transparent core bubbles with carbonation. A crisp white head traps the smell of fresh orange floor wax, wet paper pulp, and malty citrus. A bright texture settles over the course of a few minutes.

Flavor / Palate - Carbonated malts tickle the tongue before the first wave of hops scrub the palate clean. Orange glaze and resiny hops warm the throat. A long finish adds layers of rye and peppery spices. More malty than expected, this carves out a new niche that makes it a potential trendsetter for years to come.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Tropical fruit plunge into potent resins in this relatively lean and drinkable strong lager.

-Alcohol is camouflaged by the finishing resinous bitterness.
-The body is leaner than expected, which I appreciate.
-Cereals offer a few crunchy moments; there is no sloppiness here.

2486,"2014-08-11",4.2,"Served on tap in a snifter
 Appearance  The brew is served a clear light golden color with a thick one finger white head that has fantastic retention. The head slowly fades over a long time to leave a good level of lacing on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the brew is heaviest of sweeter tropical fruits of tangerine, mango and pineapple. Along with these aromas some nice bits of a grapefruit hop and a good deal of a bready and malty smell. Some lighter hoppy smells of a pine and herbal smell are there as well rounding out the aroma nicely.
 Taste  The taste begins with a slightly caramel and fruit sweetened very bready flavor with a good deal of a grapefruit hop flavor present upfront. The taste is drier then would have been expected from the nose with it only getting even drier as the taste advances. Some flavor of a pine and earthy hop nature come to the tongue more toward the middle and toward the end. With a little bit of booze, some grass, and a slight piney flavor coming to the tongue more toward the end, mixing with the other flavors and al tiny bit of booze, to leave one with a rather crisp, but rather potently hopped and malty flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is a bit higher. The mix of thicker body, which is nice for the hop and bready, and the higher carbonation which is nice of the more lager characteristics of the brew, produces a feel that is overall quite nice for the tastes of the beer.
 Overall  A quite enjoyable and robust IPL. Crisp and refreshing as a lager should be, but nicely hoped as a double imperial should be. Rather well done.","","Darkmagus82"

2486,"2014-08-10",3.7,"Crystal clear golden coloured body with a large, three centimetre tall white head makes for a nice look to the style. Aroma of very fresh hops, alcohol, light metal, but more pine and grapefruit notes make this very nice. Medium-bodied; Tastes of pine, flowers, resin, grapefruit and especially herbs show the hop profiles throughout, but the last, grassy and very herbal note make this one stand out for quite a while in the palate. Aftertaste shows a great blend of malt and hops with more of an emphasis on the hops, but a flavour-packed and still complex beer, especially for the style. Overall, definitely worth finding if you can grab it somewhere, but otherwise, a hop-forward lager makes for a nice beer, but nowhere near the depth or complexity of most ales.

2486,"2014-08-10",3.7,"Bottle.
Glass: Tired Hands wine glass.
Appearance: The body is clear with a vibrant golden-orange hue. A dense and rocky head sits on top shortly, forming an opaque white frothy coating.
Aroma: The aroma is bright and fruity with tangerine and bitter orange being prominent with honey and hints of sweet malt in the background.
Taste: The intro is clean and quick, leading to a malty and bitter mid-taste hinting at honey and bitter orange along with mango. The bitterness is a bit rough, like chewing on grapefruit rind. The finish is sort of seltzer water like with an earthy bitter finish that lingers.
Palate: Full-bodied, a bit oily and thick, with mild to moderate carbonation.
Overall: I liked this a lot initially, but something about the bitterness is making this just decent to me. Its sort of an abrasive beer, tasting a bit unrefined. Its a good beer, definitely worth checking out, but I wouldnt buy this again.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Candied grapefruit peel with little sprinkles of white pepper, orange rind, some mild sugary pale malts, with a moderately herbaceous back-end.

The taste is just like the nose citrusy, tropical with grapefruit taking the main stage on my palate. Im getting so much grapefruit I cant believe they didnt add any to the beer. Its just spectacular.

For 8.7% abv, its extremely well hidden. No residual alcohol burn at all. In fact the finish leaves me craving another sip immediately.
